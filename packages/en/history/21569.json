Now,\r\nas he died four days after our return from our last journey there, I have\r\nhad to undertake the task myself. It has been very sad to me, but I have\r\nbeen helped by knowing that, however imperfect this book may be, what is\r\nwritten here will surely be a help to those who, by following in our\r\nfootsteps, will be able to get beyond them, and to whom I so heartily\r\nwish success and a Happy Home-coming, the best wish a traveller may have.\r\nIt is for their information that I have included so many things about the\r\nprice of camels, the payment of soldiers and so forth, and yet even\r\ncasual readers may care to know these details of explorers' daily lives.\r\n\r\nMuch that is set down here has been published before, but a good deal is\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nMy husband had written several articles in the _Nineteenth Century_, and\r\nby the kindness of the editor I have been able to make use of these; also\r\nI have incorporated the lectures he had given before the Royal\r\nGeographical Society and the British Association. The rest is from his\r\nnote-books and from the 'Chronicles' that I always wrote during our\r\njourneys.\r\n\r\nI thought at first of trying to keep our several writings apart; but, to\r\navoid confusion of inverted commas, I decided, acting on advice, just to\r\nput the whole thing into as consecutive a form as possible, only saying\r\nthat the least part of the writing is mine.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography is far from complete, as I can name only a few of the\r\nmany books that my husband consulted on all the districts round those\r\nwhich we were going to penetrate.\r\n\r\nAs to the spelling of the Arabic, it must be remembered that it is a very\r\nwidely spread language, and there are naturally many different forms of\r\nthe same word--_e.g. ibn_, _ben_, _bin_--and such very various ways of\r\npronouncing the name of the Moslem prophet, that I have heard it\r\npronounced Memet, Mamad and Mad.\r\n\r\nI must give hearty thanks in both our names to all who helped us on in\r\nthese journeys, and especially to Mr. Headlam, who has given me much\r\nassistance by going through the proofs of this book. Mr. W. C. Irvine has\r\nkindly provided the column of literary Arabic for the vocabulary.\r\n\r\nMABEL VIRGINIA ANNA BENT.\r\n\r\n13 Great Cumberland Place, W:\r\n        _October 13, 1899_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n                                                              PAGE\r\nBibliography                                                   ix\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN ARABIA\r\n\r\nchapter\r\n     I.

Out of the ground he may extract\r\ntreasures, or he may not--that is not our point here--out of the\r\ninhabitants and their strange ways he is sure, whether he likes it or\r\nnot, to extract a great deal, and it is with this branch of an\r\nexcavator's life we are now going to deal.\r\n\r\nWe thought we were on the track of Phoenician remains and our interest\r\nin our work was like the fingers of an aneroid, subject to sudden\r\nchanges, but at the same time we had perpetually around us a quaint,\r\nunknown world of the present, more pleasing to most people than anything\r\npertaining to the past.\r\n\r\nThe group of islands known as Bahrein (dual form of Bahr, _i.e._ two\r\nseas) lies in a bay of the same name in the Persian Gulf, about twenty\r\nmiles off the coast of El Hasa in Arabia.\r\n\r\nBahrein is really the name of the largest of the islands, which is\r\ntwenty-seven miles long by ten wide. The second in point of size is\r\nMoharek, which lies north of Bahrein, and is separated from it by a\r\nstrait of horse-shoe form, five miles in length, and in a few places as\r\nmuch as a mile wide, but for the greater part half a mile.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group are mere rocks: Sitrah, four miles long, with a\r\nvillage on it of the same name; Nebi Saleh, Sayeh, Khaseifa, and, to the\r\neast of Moharek, Arad, with a palm-grove and a large double Portuguese\r\nfort, an island or a peninsula according to the state of the tide.\r\n\r\nIt was no use embarking on a steamer which would take us direct from\r\nEngland to our destination, owing to the complete uncertainty of the time\r\nwhen we should arrive, so we planned out our way _viâ_ Karachi and\r\nMaskat; then we had to go right up to Bushire, and again change steamers\r\nthere, for the boats going up the Gulf would not touch at Bahrein. At\r\nBushire we engaged five Persians to act as servants, interpreter, and\r\noverseers over the workmen whom we should employ in excavating.\r\n\r\nWe had as our personal servant and interpreter combined a very dirty\r\nHadji Abdullah, half Persian, half Arab. He was the best to be obtained,\r\nand his English was decidedly faulty. He always said _mules_ for meals,\r\n_foals_ for fowls, and any one who heard him say 'What time you eat your\r\nmules to-day, Sahib?' 'I have boiled two foals for dinner,' or 'Mem\r\nSahib, now I go in bazaar to buy our perwisions of grub,' or 'What place\r\nI give you your grub, Mem Sahib?' would have been surprised.\r\n\r\nHe had been a great deal on our men-of-war; he also took a present of\r\nhorses from the Sultan of Maskat to the Queen, so that he could boast 'I\r\nbeen to Home,' and alluded to his stay in England as 'when I was in\r\nHome.'\r\n\r\nAbdullah always says _chuck_ and never _throw_; and people unused to\r\nhim would not take in that 'Those peacock no good, carboys much better,'\r\nreferred to pickaxes and crowbars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOSQUE AT MANAMAH, BAHREIN]\r\n\r\nHe used to come to the diggings and say: 'A couble of Sheikhs come here\r\nin camp, Sahib. I am standing them some coffee; shall I stand them some\r\nmixed biscuits, too?'\r\n\r\nI must say I pity foreigners who have to trust to interpreters whose only\r\nEuropean language is such English as this.\r\n\r\nWith the whole of our party we embarked on the steamer which took us to\r\nBahrein, or rather as close as it could approach; for, owing to the\r\nshallowness of the sea, while still far from shore we were placed in a\r\nbaggala in which we sailed for about twenty minutes. Then when a smaller\r\nboat had conveyed us as near to the dry land as possible, we were in\r\nmid-ocean transferred, bag and baggage, to asses, those lovely white\r\nasses of Bahrein with tails and manes dyed yellow with henna, and\r\ngrotesque patterns illuminating their flanks; we had no reins or\r\nstirrups, and as the asses, though more intelligent than our own, will\r\nnot unfrequently show obstinacy in the water, the rider, firmly grasping\r\nhis pommel, reaches with thankfulness the slimy, oozy beach of Bahrein.\r\n\r\nManamah is the name of the town at which you land; it is the commercial\r\ncapital of the islands--just a streak of white houses and bamboo huts,\r\nextending about a mile and a half along the shore. A few mosques with low\r\nminarets may be seen, having stone steps up one side, by which the priest\r\nascends for the call to prayer. These mosques and the towers of the\r\nricher pearl merchants show some decided architectural features, having\r\narches of the Saracenic order, with fretwork of plaster and quaint stucco\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nOn landing we were at once surrounded by a jabbering crowd of negro\r\nslaves, and stately Arabs with long, flowing robes and twisted\r\ncamel-hair cords (akkal) around their heads.\r\n\r\nOur home while in the town was one of the best of the battlemented\r\ntowers, and consisted of a room sixteen feet square, on a stone platform.\r\nIt had twenty-six windows with no glass in them, but pretty lattice of\r\nplaster. Our wooden lock was highly decorated, and we had a wooden key to\r\nclose our door, which pleased us much. Even though we were close upon the\r\ntropics we found our abode chilly enough after sunset; and our nights\r\nwere rendered hideous--firstly, by the barking of dogs; secondly, by\r\ncocks which crowed at an inordinately early hour; and, thirdly, by pious\r\nMussulmans hard at work praying before the sun rose.\r\n\r\nFrom our elevated position we could look down into a sea of bamboo huts,\r\nthe habitations of the pearl-fishers: neat enough abodes, with courtyards\r\npaved with helix shells. In these courtyards stood quaint, large\r\nwater-jars, which women filled from goat-skins carried on their shoulders\r\nfrom the wells, wobbling when full like live headless animals; and\r\ncradles, like hencoops, for their babies. They were a merry idle lot of\r\nfolk just then, for it was not their season of work: perpetually playing\r\ngames (of which tip-jack and top-spinning appeared the favourite for both\r\nyoung and old) seemed to be their chief occupation. Staid Arabs, with\r\nturbans and long, flowing robes, spinning tops, formed a sight of which\r\nwe never tired. The spinning-tops are made out of whelk-shells, which I\r\nreally believe must have been the original pattern from which our\r\ndomestic toy was made. The door-posts of their huts are often made of\r\nwhales' jaws; a great traffic is done in sharks; the cases for their\r\nswords and daggers are all of shagreen. The gulf well deserves the name\r\ngiven to it by Ptolemy of the _Ichthyophagorum sinus_.\r\n\r\nWalking through the bazaars one is much struck by the quaint, huge iron\r\nlocks, some of them with keys nearly two feet long, and ingeniously\r\nopened by pressure of a spring. In the commoner houses the locks and keys\r\nare all of wood. In the bazaars, too, you may find that queer El Hasa\r\nmoney called Tawilah, or 'long bits,' short bars of copper doubled back\r\nand compressed together, with a few characters indicating the prince who\r\nstruck them.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-pots of Bahrein are quite a specialty, also coming from El\r\nHasa, which appears to be the centre of art in this part of Arabia. With\r\ntheir long beak-like spouts and concentric circles with patterns on them,\r\nthese coffee-pots are a distinct feature. In the bazaars of Manamah and\r\nMoharek coffee-vendors sit at every corner with some huge pots of a\r\nsimilar shape simmering on the embers; in the lid are introduced stones\r\nto make a noise and attract the attention of the passers-by. Coffee-shops\r\ntake the place of spirit and wine shops, which in the strict Wahabi\r\ncountry would not be, for a moment, tolerated. In private houses it is\r\nthought well to have four or five coffee-pots standing round the fire, to\r\ngive an appearance of riches.\r\n\r\nBesides the coffee-pots, other objects of El Hasa workmanship may be seen\r\nin Bahrein. Every household of respectability has its wooden bowl with\r\nwhich to offer visitors a drink of water or sour milk; these are\r\nbeautifully inlaid with silver in very elaborate patterns. The guns used\r\nby Bahreini sportsmen are similarly inlaid, and the camel saddles of the\r\nsheikhs are most beautifully decorated on the pommels in the same style.\r\n\r\nThe anvils, at which the blacksmiths in the bazaars were squatting, were\r\nlike large nails with heads about six inches square, driven into the\r\nground and about a foot high.\r\n\r\nThe old weapons of the Bedouin Arabs are still in use in Bahrein: the\r\nlong lance which is put up before the tent of the chief when he goes\r\nabout, the shield of camel-skin decorated with gold paint and brass\r\nknobs, the coat of mail, and other objects of warfare used in an age long\r\ngone by. Every other stall has dates to sell in thick masses, the chief\r\nfood of the islanders. Then you may see locusts pressed and pickled in\r\nbarrels; the poorer inhabitants are very fond of this diet, and have\r\nconverted the curse of the cultivator into a favourite delicacy. As for\r\nweights, the stall-holders would appear to have none but stones, whelk\r\nshells, and potsherds, which must be hard to regulate.\r\n\r\nAn ancient Arab author states that in Oman 'men obtain fire from a spark,\r\nby rolling the tinder in dry Arab grass and swinging it round till it\r\nbursts into flame.' We often saw this process and bought one of the\r\nlittle cages, hanging to a long chain, which they use in Bahrein.\r\n\r\nOf course pearl-fishing is the great occupation of the islands, and\r\nManamah is inhabited chiefly by pearl merchants and divers. Bahrein has\r\nin fact been celebrated for its pearl-fishing ever since the days of the\r\nPeriplus of Nearchus, in the time of Alexander the Great.\r\n\r\nAlbuquerque, in his commentaries,[1] thus speaks of Bahrein pearl-fishing\r\nin 1510:--'Bahrein is noted for its large breeding of horses, its barley\r\ncrops, and the variety of its fruits; and all around it are the fishing\r\ngrounds of seed pearls, and of pearls which are sent to these realms of\r\nPortugal, for they are better and more lasting than any that are found in\r\nany other of these parts.' This is also the verdict of the modern pearl\r\nmerchants, who value Bahrein pearls, as more lasting and harder than\r\nthose even of Ceylon. Evidently Albuquerque got an order from his\r\nsovereign for pearls, for he writes,[2] in 1515, that he is getting the\r\npearls which the king had ordered for 'the pontifical of our lady.' To\r\nthis day in their dealings the pearl merchants of Bahrein still make use\r\nof the old Portuguese weights and names.\r\n\r\nThe pearl oyster is found in all the waters from Ras Mussendom to the\r\nhead of the Gulf, but on the Persian side there are no known banks of\r\nvalue. They vary in distance from one to ninety miles from the low-lying\r\nshore of 'Araby the Blest,' but the deep sea banks are not so much fished\r\ntill the 'Shemal' or nor'westers of June have spent their force. The\r\nthree seasons for fishing are known as 'the spring fishing' in the\r\nshallow water, 'the summer fishing' in the deep waters, and 'the winter\r\nfishing' conducted principally by wading in the shoals. The pearls of\r\nthese seas are still celebrated for their firmness, and do not peel. They\r\nare commonly reported to lose one per cent. annually for fifty years in\r\ncolour and water, but after that they remain the same. They have seven\r\nskins, whereas the Cingalese pearls have only six. The merchants\r\ngenerally buy them wholesale by the old Portuguese weight of the _chao_.\r\nThey divide them into different sizes with sieves and sell them in India,\r\nso that, as is usually the case with specialties, it is impossible to buy\r\na good pearl on Bahrein.\r\n\r\nDiving here is exceedingly primitive; all the necessary paraphernalia\r\nconsists of a loop of rope and a stone to go down with, a curious horn\r\nthing to hold the nose, and oil for the orifice of the ears. Once a\r\nmerchant brought with him a diving apparatus, but the divers were highly\r\nindignant, and leaguing against him refused to show the best banks. In\r\nthis way the fisheries suffer, for the best pearls are in the deeper\r\nwaters, which can only be visited late in the season. The divers are\r\nmostly negro slaves from Africa; they do not live long, poor creatures,\r\ndeveloping awful sores and weak eyes, and they live and die entirely\r\nwithout medical aid.\r\n\r\nAt present the pearl-fisheries employ about four hundred boats of from\r\neight to twenty men each. Each boat pays a tax to the sheikh. The fishing\r\nseason lasts from April to October.\r\n\r\nVery curious boats ply in the waters between Manamah and Moharek; the\r\nhuge ungainly baggalas can only sail in the deeper channels. The Bahrein\r\nboats have very long-pointed prows, elegantly carved and decorated with\r\nshells; when the wind is contrary they are propelled by poles or paddles,\r\nconsisting of boards of any shape tied to the end of the poles with\r\ntwine, and the oarsman always seats himself on the gunwale.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the way these boats are tied and sewn together may have given\r\nrise to the legend alluded to by Sir John Maundeville when he saw them at\r\nthe Isle of Hormuz. 'Near that isle there are ships without nails of iron\r\nor bonds, on account of the rocks of adamants (loadstones), for they are\r\nall abundant there in that sea that it is marvellous to speak of, and if\r\na ship passed there that had iron bonds or iron nails it would perish,\r\nfor the adamant, by its nature, draws iron to it, and so it would draw\r\nthe ship that it should never depart from it.'\r\n\r\nMany of the boats have curious-shaped stone anchors, and water casks of\r\nuniform and doubtless old-world shape. The sheikh has some fine war\r\nvessels, called _batils_, which did good execution about fifty years ago,\r\nwhen the Sultan of Oman and the rulers of El Hasa tried to seize Bahrein,\r\nand a naval battle took place in the shallow sea off the coast in which\r\nthe Bahreini were victorious. Now that the Gulf is practically English\r\nand piracy at an end, these vessels are more ornamental than useful. His\r\nlarge baggala, which mounted ten tiny guns and was named the _Dunijah_,\r\nis now employed in trade.\r\n\r\nThen there are the bamboo skiffs with decks almost flush with the side,\r\nrequiring great skill in working. Boats are really of but little use\r\nimmediately around the islands. You see men walking in the sea quite a\r\nmile out, collecting shellfish and seaweeds, which form a staple diet for\r\nboth man and beast on Bahrein.\r\n\r\nThe shallowness of the sea between Bahrein and the mainland has\r\ncontributed considerably to the geographical and mercantile importance of\r\nthe Bahrein. No big vessels can approach the opposite coast of Arabia;\r\nhence, in olden days, when the caravan trade passed this way, all goods\r\nmust have been transhipped to smaller boats at Bahrein.\r\n\r\nSir M. Durant, in a consular report, states it as his opinion that,\r\n'under a settled government, Bahrein could be the trading place of the\r\nPersian Gulf for Persia and Arabia, and an excellent harbour near the\r\nwarehouses could be formed.'\r\n\r\nIf the Euphrates Valley Railway had ever been opened, if the terminus of\r\nthis railway had been at Koweit, as it was proposed by the party of\r\nsurvey under the command of Admiral Charlewood and General Chesney, the\r\nBahrein group would at once have sprung into importance as offering a\r\nsafe emporium in the immediate vicinity of this terminus. Bahrein is the\r\nCyprus of the Persian Gulf, in fact. This day is, however, postponed\r\nindefinitely until such times as England, Turkey, and Russia shall see\r\nfit to settle their differences; and with a better understanding between\r\nthese Powers, and the development of railways in the East, the Persian\r\nGulf may yet once more become a high road of commerce, and the Bahrein\r\nIslands may again come into notice.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese, who were the first Europeans after the time of Alexander\r\nto visit the Gulf, recognised the importance of Bahrein. Up to their time\r\nthe Gulf had been a closed Mohammedan lake. The history of their rule in\r\nthat part has yet to be written, but it will disclose a tale of great\r\ninterest, and be a record of marvellous commercial enterprise. It was\r\nAlbuquerque who first reopened the Gulf to Europeans.\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century (1504), he urged the occupation of the\r\nGulf. In 1506 three fleets went to the East under the command of Tristan\r\nd'Acunha, with Albuquerque as second in command. Tristan soon took his\r\ndeparture further afield, and left Albuquerque in command. This admiral\r\nfirst attacked and took Hormuz, then governed by a king of Persian\r\norigin. Here, and at Maskat, he thoroughly established the Portuguese\r\npower, thereby commanding the entrance into the Gulf. From de Barros'\r\naccount it would appear that the king of Bahrein was a tributary of the\r\nking of Hormuz, paying annually 40,000 _pardaos_, and from Albuquerque's\r\nletters we read that the occupation of Bahrein formed part of his scheme.\r\n'With Hormuz and Bahrein in their hand the whole Gulf would be under\r\ntheir control,' he wrote. In fact, Albuquerque's scheme at that time\r\nwould appear to have been exceedingly vast and rather chimerical--namely,\r\nto divert the Nile from its course and let it flow into the Red Sea, ruin\r\nEgypt, and bring the India trade _viâ_ the Persian Gulf to Europe. Of\r\nthis scheme we have only the outline, but, beyond establishing fortresses\r\nin the Gulf, it fell through, for Albuquerque died, and with him his\r\ngigantic projects.\r\n\r\nThe exact date of the occupation of Bahrein by the Portuguese I have as\r\nyet been unable to discover; but in 1521 we read of an Arab insurrection\r\nin Bahrein against the Persians and Portuguese, in which the Portuguese\r\nfactor, Ruy Bale, was tortured and crucified.\r\n\r\nSheikh Hussein bin Said, of the Arabian tribe of Ben Zabia, was the\r\ninstigator of this revolt. In the following year the Portuguese governor,\r\nDom Luis de Menezes, came to terms with him, and appointed him\r\nPortuguese representative in the island.\r\n\r\nA few years later, one Ras Bardadim, _guazil_, or governor of Bahrein,\r\nmade himself objectionable, and against him Simeon d'Acunha was sent. He\r\nand many of his men died of fever in the expedition, but the Portuguese\r\npower was again restored.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the sixteenth century the Portuguese came under the\r\nrule of Spain, and from that date their power in the Persian Gulf began\r\nto wane. Their soldiers were drafted off to the wars in Flanders instead\r\nof going to the East to protect the colonies; and the final blow came in\r\n1622, when Shah Abbas of Persia, assisted by an English fleet, took\r\nHormuz, and then Bahrein. Twenty years later a company of Portuguese\r\nmerchants, eager for the pearls of these islands, organised an expedition\r\nfrom Goa to recover the Bahrein, but the ships were taken and plundered\r\nby the Arabs before ever they entered the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThus fell the great Portuguese power in the Gulf, the sole traces of\r\nwhich now are the numerous fortresses, such as the one on Bahrein.\r\n\r\nFrom 1622 to the present time the control over Bahrein has been contested\r\nbetween the Persians and Arabs, and as the Persian power has been on the\r\nwane, the Arabian star has been in the ascendent. In 1711 the Sultan bin\r\nSeif wrested Bahrein from Persia; in 1784 the Uttubbi of El Hasa\r\nconquered it. They have held it ever since, despite the attempts of Seyid\r\nSaid of Oman, of the Turks and Persians, to take it from them. The Turks\r\nhave, however, succeeded in driving them out of their original kingdom of\r\nEl Hasa, on the mainland of Arabia opposite, and now the Bahrein is all\r\nthat remains to them of their former extensive territories.\r\n\r\nThe royal family is a numerous one, being a branch of the El Khalifa\r\ntribe. They are the chiefs of the Uttubbi tribe of Arabs.\r\n\r\nMost of them, if not actually belonging to that strict sect of Arabians\r\nknown as Wahabi, have strong puritanical proclivities. Our teetotalers\r\nare nothing to them in bigotry. If a vendor of intoxicating liquor\r\nstarted a shop on Bahrein, they would burn his house down, so that the\r\nwicked who want to drink any intoxicating liquor have to buy the material\r\nsecretly from ships in the harbour. Many think it wrong to smoke, and\r\nspend their lives in prayer and fasting. Church decoration is an\r\nabomination to the Wahabi; therefore, in Bahrein the mosques are little\r\nbetter than barns with low minarets, for the very tall ones of other\r\nMohammedan sects are forbidden. The Wahabi are fanatics of the deepest\r\ndye; 'there is one God, and Mohammed is his prophet,' they say with the\r\nrest of the Mohammedan world, but the followers of Abdul Wahab add, 'and\r\nin no case must Mohammed and the Imams be worshipped lest glory be\r\ndetracted from God.' All titles to them are odious; no grand tombs are to\r\nbe erected over their dead, no mourning is allowed; hence the cemetery at\r\nManamah is but a pitiful place--a vast collection of circles set with\r\nrough stones, each with a small uninscribed headpiece, and the surface\r\nsprinkled with helix shells.\r\n\r\nThe Wahabi would wage, if they dared, perpetual war not only against the\r\ninfidel, but against such perverted individuals as those who go to\r\nworship at Mecca and other sacred shrines. The founder of this revival is\r\nreported to have beaten his sons to death for drinking wine, and to have\r\nmade his daughters support themselves by spinning, but at the same time\r\nhe felt himself entitled to give to a fanatical follower, who courted\r\ndeath for his sake, an order for an emerald palace and a large number of\r\nfemale slaves in the world to come.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 the Shah of Persia aimed at acquiring Bahrein, though his only\r\nclaim to it was based on the fact that Bahrein had been an appanage of\r\nthe Persian crown under the Suffavian kings. He instituted a revolt on\r\nthe island; adopted a claimant to the sheikhdom, and got him to hoist the\r\nPersian flag. Our ships blockaded Bahrein, intercepted letters, and\r\nobliged the rebel sheikh to quit. Then it was that we took the islands\r\nunder our protection. In 1875 the Turks caused trouble, and the\r\noccupation of Bahrein formed part of their great scheme of conquest in\r\nArabia. Our ship the _Osprey_ appeared on the scene, drove back the\r\nTurks, transported to India several sheikhs who were hostile to the\r\nEnglish rule, and placed Sheikh Isa (or Esau) on the throne under British\r\nprotection, under which he rules happily to this day.\r\n\r\nWe went to see him at Moharek, where he holds his court in the\r\nwinter-time. We crossed over in a small baggala, and had to be poled for\r\na great distance with our keel perpetually grating on the bottom. It was\r\nlike driving in a carriage on a jolting road; the donkeys trotted\r\nindependently across, their legs quite covered with water. We were glad\r\nwhen they came alongside, and we completed our journey on their backs.\r\n\r\nThe courtyard of the palace, which somewhat recalls the Alhambra in its\r\narchitecture, was, when we arrived, crowded with Arab chiefs in all\r\nmanner of quaint costumes. His majesty's dress was exceedingly fine. He\r\nand his family are entitled to wear their camel-hair bands bound round\r\nwith gold thread. These looked very regal over the red turban, and his\r\nlong black coat, with his silver-studded sword by his side, made him look\r\nevery inch a king.\r\n\r\nHe is most submissive to British interests, inasmuch as his immediate\r\npredecessors who did not love England were shipped off to India, and\r\nstill languish there in exile; as he owes his throne entirely to British\r\nprotection, he and his family will probably continue to reign as long as\r\nthe English are virtual owners of the Gulf, if they are willing to submit\r\nto the English protectorate.\r\n\r\nWe got a photograph of a group of them resting on their guns, and with\r\ntheir kanjars or sickle-shaped daggers at their waists. We took Prince\r\nMohamed, the heir-apparent, and the stout Seid bin Omar, the prime\r\nminister of Bahrein. But Sheikh Esau refused to place his august person\r\nwithin reach of our camera.\r\n\r\nDuring our visit we were seated on high arm-chairs of the kind so much\r\nused in India, and the only kind used here. They were white and hoary\r\nwith old age and long estrangement from furniture polish. For our sins we\r\nhad to drink the bitterest black coffee imaginable, which tasted like\r\nvarnish from the bitter seeds infused in it; this was followed by cups of\r\nsweet syrup flavoured with cinnamon, a disagreeable custom to those\r\naccustomed to take their coffee and sugar together.\r\n\r\nMoharek is aristocratic, being the seat of government; Manamah is\r\nessentially commercial, and between them in the sea is a huge dismantled\r\nPortuguese fort, now used as Sheikh Esau's stables.\r\n\r\nThe town of Moharek gets its water supply from a curious source,\r\nspringing up from under the sea. At high tide there is about a fathom of\r\nsalt water over the spring, and water is brought up either by divers who\r\ngo down with skins, or by pushing a hollow bamboo down into it. At low\r\ntide there is very little water over it, and women with large amphora and\r\ngoat-skins wade out and fetch what water they require; they tell me that\r\nthe spring comes up with such force that it drives back the salt water\r\nand never gets impregnated. All I can answer for is that the water is\r\nexcellent to drink.\r\n\r\nThis source is called Bir Mahab, and there are several of a similar\r\nnature on the coast around: the Kaseifah spring and others. There is such\r\na spring in the harbour of Syracuse, about twenty feet under the sea.\r\n\r\nThe legend is that in the time of Merwan, a chief, Ibn Hakim, from Katif,\r\nwished to marry the lovely daughter of a Bahrein chief. His suit was not\r\nacceptable, so he made war on the islands and captured all the wells\r\nwhich supplied the towns on the bigger island; but the guardian deity of\r\nthe Bahreini caused this spring to break out in the sea just before\r\nMoharek, and the invader was thus in time repulsed. It is a curious fact\r\nthat Arados or Arvad, the Phoenician town on the Mediterranean, was\r\nsupplied by a similar submarine source.\r\n\r\nSheikh Esau's representative at Manamah--his prime minister or viceroy,\r\nwe should call him, though he is usually known there by the\r\nhumble-sounding title of the 'bazaar master,' by name Seid bin Omar, is a\r\nvery stout and nearly black individual, with a European cast of\r\ncountenance. He looked exceedingly grand when he came to see us, in his\r\nunder-robe of scarlet cloth, with a cloak of rustling and stiff white\r\nwool with a little red woven in it. Over his head floated a white\r\ncashmere shawl, with the usual camel-hair rings to keep it on, and\r\nsandals on his bare feet. He was deputed by his sovereign to look after\r\nus, and during the fortnight we were on the island he never left us for a\r\nsingle day. Though outwardly very strict in his asceticism, and\r\nconstantly apt to say his prayers with his nose in the dust at\r\ninconvenient moments, we found him by no means averse to a cigarette in\r\nthe strictest privacy, and we learnt that his private life would not bear\r\nEuropean investigation. He is constantly getting married. Though sixty\r\nyears of age he had a young bride of a few weeks' standing. I was assured\r\nthat he would soon tire of her and put her away. Even in polygamous\r\nArabia he is looked upon as a much-married man.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: P. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: P. 328.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNDS OF ALI\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now behold us excavators on the way to the scene of our labours. Six\r\ncamels conveyed our tents, a seventh carried goat-skins full of water.\r\nFour asses groaned under our personal effects; hens for consumption rode\r\nin a sort of lobster-pot by the side of clattering pickaxes and chairs;\r\nsix policemen, or _peons_, were in our train, each on a donkey. One\r\ncarried a paraffin lamp, another a basket of eggs on the palm of his\r\nhand, and as there were no reins and no stirrups, the wonder is that\r\nthese articles ever survived. As for ourselves, we, like everybody else,\r\nrode sideways, holding on like grim death before and behind, especially\r\nwhen the frisky Bahrein donkeys galloped at steeplechase pace across the\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nFor some distance around Manamah all is arid desert, on which grow a few\r\nscrubby plants, which women cut for fodder with sickle-like saws, and\r\ncarry home in large bundles on their backs. Sheikh Esau's summer palace\r\nis in the centre of this desert--a fortress hardly distinguishable from\r\nthe sand around, and consisting, like Eastern structures of this nature,\r\nof nothing but one room over the gateway for his majesty, and a vast\r\ncourtyard 200 feet long, where his attendants erect their bamboo huts and\r\ntents. Around the whole runs a wall with bastions at each corner, very\r\nformidable to look upon. Passing this, the palm-groves, which are\r\nexceedingly fine, are soon reached, and offer delicious shade from the\r\nburning sun. Here amongst the trees were women working in picturesque\r\nattire, red petticoats, orange-coloured drawers down to their heels, and\r\na dark blue covering over all this, which would suddenly be pulled over\r\nthe face at our approach, if they had not on their masks, or _buttras_,\r\nwhich admit of a good stare.\r\n\r\nThe _buttra_ is a kind of mask, more resembling a bridle than anything\r\nelse. In shape it is like two diamond-frames made of gold and coloured\r\nbraids, fastened together by two of their lower edges. This middle strip\r\ncomes down the nose and covers the mouth, and the sides come between the\r\nears and eyes. It affords very little concealment, but is very becoming\r\nto most of its wearers, particularly if they happen to be negresses. On\r\ntheir heads would be baskets with dates or citrons, and now and again a\r\nparticularly modest one would dart behind a palm-tree until that\r\ndangerous animal man had gone by.\r\n\r\nAbout half way to the scene of our labours we halted by the ruins of the\r\nold Arab town, Beled-al-Kadim.\r\n\r\nThis ancient capital, dating from a period prior to the Portuguese\r\noccupation, still presents some interesting ruins. The old mosque\r\n(Madresseh-i-abu-Zeidan), with its two slender and elegant minarets, so\r\ndifferent from the horrible Wahabi constructions of to-day, forms a\r\nconspicuous landmark for ships approaching the low-lying coasts of these\r\nislands. Around the body of the mosque runs a fine inscription in Kufic\r\nletters, and from the fact that the name of Ali is joined with that of\r\nthe Prophet in the profession of faith, we may argue that this mosque was\r\nbuilt during some Persian occupation, and was a Shiite mosque. The\r\narchitecture, too, is distinctly Persian, recalling to us in its details\r\nthe ruins of Rhey (the Rhages of Tobit) and of Sultanieh, which we saw in\r\nthe north of Persia, and has nothing Arabian about it.\r\n\r\nRuins of houses and buildings surround this mosque, and here in the open\r\nspace in the centre of the palm-groves the Bahreini assemble every\r\nThursday for a market; in fact the place is generally known now as\r\nSuk-el-Khamis, or Thursday's Market.\r\n\r\nOn our journey out not a soul was near, but on our return we had an\r\nopportunity of attending one of these gatherings.\r\n\r\nSheikh Esau has here a tiny mosque, just an open _loggia_, where he goes\r\nevery morning in summer-time to pray and take his coffee. Beneath it he\r\nhas a bath of fresh but not over-clean water, where he and his family\r\nbathe. Often during the summer heats he spends the whole day here, or\r\nelse he goes to his glorious garden about a mile distant, near the coast,\r\nwhere acacias, hibiscus, and almonds fight with one another for the\r\nmastery, and form a delicious tangle.\r\n\r\nAnother mile on, closer to the sea, is the fine ruined fortress of the\r\nPortuguese, Gibliah, as the natives call it now, just as they do one of\r\nthe fortresses at Maskat. It covers nearly two acres of ground, and is\r\nbuilt out of the remains of the old Persian town, for many Kufic\r\ninscriptions are let into the wall, and the deep well in the centre is\r\nlined with them. It is a regular bastioned fortification of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, with moat, embrasures in the parapets, and casemented embrasures\r\nin the re-entering angles of the bastions, and is one of the finest\r\nspecimens of Portuguese architecture in the Gulf, an evidence of the\r\nimportance which they attached to this island.\r\n\r\nAmongst the rubbish in the fort we picked up numerous fragments of fine\r\nNankin and Celadon china, attesting to the ubiquity and commerce of the\r\nformer owners, and attesting, also, to the luxury of the men who ruled\r\nhere--a luxury as fatal almost as the Flanders wars to the well-being of\r\nthe Portuguese in the East.\r\n\r\nOur road led us on through miles of palm-groves, watered by their little\r\nartificial conduits, and producing the staple food of the island. Seid\r\nbin Omar talked to us much about the date. 'Mohammed said,' he began,\r\n'honour the date-tree, for she is your mother,' a true enough maxim in\r\nparched Arabia, where nothing else will grow. When ripe the dates are put\r\ninto a round tank, called the _madibash_, where they are exposed to the\r\nsun and air, and throw off excessive juice which collects below; after\r\nthree days of this treatment they are removed and packed for exportation\r\nin baskets of palm leaves. The Bahreini, for their own consumption, love\r\nto add sesame seeds to their dates, or ginger powder and walnuts pressed\r\nwith them into jars. These are called _sirah_, and are originally\r\nprepared by being dried in the sun and protected at night, then diluted\r\ndate-juice is poured over them. The fruit which does not reach maturity\r\nis called _salang_, and is given as food to cattle, boiled with ground\r\ndate-stones and fish bones. This makes an excellent sort of cake for\r\nmilch cows; this, and the green dates also, are given to the donkeys, and\r\nto this food the Bahreini attribute their great superiority. The very\r\npoor also make an exceedingly unpalatable dish out of green dates mixed\r\nwith fish for their own table, or, I should say, floor.\r\n\r\nNature here is not strong enough for the fructification of the palm, so\r\nat given seasons the pollen is removed by cutting off the male spathes;\r\nthese they dry for twenty hours, and then they take the flower twigs and\r\ndeposit one or two in each bunch of the female blossom. Just as we were\r\nthere they were very busy with the spathes, and in Thursday's Market huge\r\nbaskets of the male spathes were exposed for sale. The palm-groves are\r\nsurrounded by dykes to keep the water in.\r\n\r\nThe date-tree is everything to a Bahreini. He beats the green spadix\r\nwith wooden implements to make fibre for his ropes; in the dry state he\r\nuses it as fuel; he makes his mats, the only known form of carpet and\r\nbedding here, out of it; his baskets are made of the leaves. From the\r\nfresh spathe, by distillation, a certain stuff called _tara_ water is\r\nobtained, of strong but agreeable smell, which is much used for the\r\nmaking of sherbet. Much legendary lore is connected with the date. The\r\nsmall round hole at the back is said to have been made by Mohammed's\r\nteeth, when one day he foolishly tried to bite one; and in some places\r\nthe expression 'at the same time a date and a duty,' is explained by the\r\nfact that in Ramazan the day's fast is usually broken by first eating a\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nAmongst all these date-groves are the curious Arab wells, with sloping\r\nruns, and worked by donkeys. The tall poles, to which the skins are\r\nattached, are date-tree trunks. Down goes the skin bucket as the donkey\r\ncomes up a steep slope in the ground, and then, as he goes down, up it\r\ncomes again full of water, to be guided into the channel, which\r\nfertilises the trees, by a slave, who supports himself going up, and adds\r\nhis weight to that of the descending donkey, by putting his arm through a\r\nlarge wooden ring hung at the donkey's shoulder. Day after day in our\r\ncamp we heard the weird creaking from these wells, very early in the\r\nmorning and in the evening when the sun had gone down, and we felt as we\r\nheard it what an infinite blessing is a well of water in a thirsty land.\r\n\r\nLeaving the palm-groves and the Portuguese fortress behind us, we\r\nre-entered the desert to the south-west; and, just beyond the village of\r\nAli, we came upon that which is the great curiosity of Bahrein, to\r\ninvestigate which was our real object in visiting the island: for there\r\nbegins that vast sea of sepulchral mounds, the great necropolis of an\r\nunknown race which extends far and wide across the plain. The village of\r\nAli forms as it were the culminating point; it lies just on the borders\r\nof the date-groves, and there the mounds reach an elevation of over forty\r\nfeet, but as they extend further southward they diminish in size, until\r\nmiles away, in the direction of Rufa'a, we found mounds elevated only a\r\nfew feet above the level of the desert, and some mere circular heaps of\r\nstones. There are many thousands of these tumuli extending over an area\r\nof desert for many miles. There are isolated groups of mounds in other\r\nparts of the islands, and a few solitary ones are to be found on the\r\nadjacent islets, on Moharek, Arad, and Sitrah.\r\n\r\nComplete uncertainty existed as to the origin of these mounds, and the\r\npeople who constructed them, but, from classical references and the\r\nresult of our own work, there can now be no doubt that they are of\r\nPhoenician origin. Herodotus[3] gives us as a tradition current in his\r\ntime that the forefathers of the Phoenician race came from these parts.\r\nThe Phoenicians themselves believed in it: 'It is their own account of\r\nthemselves,' says Herodotus; and Strabo[4] brings further testimony to\r\nbear on the subject, stating that two of the islands now called Bahrein\r\nwere called Tyros and Arados. Pliny follows in Strabo's steps, but calls\r\nthe island Tylos instead of Tyros, which may be only an error in\r\nspelling, or may be owing to the universal confusion of _r_ with _l_.\r\n\r\nPtolemy in his map places Gerrha, the mart of ancient Indian trade and\r\nthe starting-point for caravans on the great road across Arabia, on the\r\ncoast just opposite the islands, near where the town of El Katif now is,\r\nand accepts Strabo's and Pliny's names for the Bahrein Islands, calling\r\nthem Tharros, Tylos or Tyros, and Arados. The fact is that all our\r\ninformation on the islands prior to the Portuguese occupation comes from\r\nthe Periplus of Nearchus. Eratosthenes, a naval officer of Alexander's,\r\nstates that the Gulf was 10,000 stadia long from Cape Armozum, _i.e._\r\nHormuz, to Teredon (Koweit), and the mouth of the Euphrates. Androsthenes\r\nof Thasos, who was of the company of Nearchus, made an independent\r\ngeographical survey of the Gulf on the Arabian side, and his statements\r\nare, that on an island called Ikaros, now Peludji, just off Koweit, he\r\nsaw a temple of Apollo. Southwards, at a distance of 2,400 stadia, or 43\r\nnautical leagues, he came on Gerrha, and, close to it, the islands of\r\nTyros and Arados, 'which have temples like those of the Phoenicians,'\r\nwho were (the inhabitants told him) colonists from these parts. From\r\nNearchus, too, we learn that the Phoenicians had a town called Sidon or\r\nSidodona in the Gulf, which he visited, and on an island called Tyrine\r\nwas shown the tomb of Erythras, which he describes as 'an elevated\r\nhillock covered with palms,' just like our mounds, and Erythras was the\r\nking who gave his name to the Gulf. Justin accepts the migration of the\r\nPhoenicians from the Persian Gulf as certain; and M. Renan says, 'The\r\nprimitive abode of the Phoenicians must be placed on the Lower\r\nEuphrates, in the centre of the great commercial and maritime\r\nestablishments of the Persian Gulf.'[5] As for the temples, there are no\r\ntraces of them left, and this is also the case in Syrian Phoenicia;\r\ndoubtless they were all built of wood, which will account for their\r\ndisappearance.\r\n\r\nAs we ourselves, during the course of our excavations, brought to light\r\nobjects of distinctly Phoenician origin, there would appear to be no\r\nlonger any room for doubt that the mounds which lay before us were a vast\r\nnecropolis of this mercantile race. If so, one of two suppositions must\r\nbe correct, either firstly, that the Phoenicians originally lived here\r\nbefore they migrated to the Mediterranean, and that this was the land of\r\nPunt from which the Puni got their name, a land of palms like the Syrian\r\ncoast from which the race got their distorted Greek appellation of\r\nPhoenicians; or secondly, that these islands were looked upon by them\r\nas a sacred spot for the burial of their dead, as the Hindoo looks upon\r\nthe Ganges, and the Persian regards the shrines of Kerbela and Meshed. I\r\nam much more inclined to the former supposition, judging from the\r\nmercantile importance of the Bahrein Islands and the excellent school\r\nthey must have been for a race which was to penetrate to all the then\r\nknown corners of the globe--to brave the dangers of the open Atlantic,\r\nand to reach the shores of Britain in their trading ventures; and if\r\nnomenclature goes for anything, the name of Tyros and the still-existing\r\nname of Arad ought to confirm us in our belief and make certainty more\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nOur camp was pitched on this desert among the tumuli. The ground was hard\r\nand rough, covered with very sharp stones; though dry, it sounded hollow,\r\nand it seemed as though there were water under it.\r\n\r\nOur own tent occupied a conspicuous and central place; our servants' tent\r\nwas hard by, liable to be blown down by heavy gusts of wind, which event\r\nhappened the first night after our arrival, to the infinite discomfiture\r\nof the bazaar-master, who, by the way, had left his grand clothes at\r\nhome, and appeared in the desert clad in a loose coffee-coloured\r\ndressing-gown, with a red band round his waist. Around the tents swarmed\r\nturbaned diggers, who looked as if they had come out in their\r\nnight-gowns, dressing-gowns, and bath-sheets. These lodged at night in\r\nthe bamboo village of Ali hard by, a place for which we developed the\r\nprofoundest contempt, for the women thereof refused to pollute themselves\r\nby washing the clothes of infidels, and our garments had to be sent all\r\nthe way to Manamah to be cleansed. A bamboo structure formed a shelter\r\nfor the kitchen, around which, on the sand, lay curious coffee-pots,\r\nbowls, and cooking utensils, which would have been eagerly sought after\r\nfor museums in Europe. The camel, which fetched the daily supply of water\r\nfrom afar, grazed around on the coarse desert herbage; the large white\r\ndonkey which went into the town for marketing by day, and entangled\r\nhimself in the tent ropes by night, was also left to wander at his own\r\nsweet will. This desert camp was evidently considered a very peculiar\r\nsight indeed, and no wonder that for the first week of our residence\r\nthere, we were visited by all the inhabitants of Bahrein who could find\r\ntime to come so far.\r\n\r\nIt was very weird to sit in our tent door the first evening and look at\r\nthe great mound we were going to dig into next morning, and think how\r\nlong it had stood there in the peace its builders hoped for it. There\r\nseemed to be quite a mournful feeling about disturbing it; but\r\narchæologists are a ruthless body, and this was to be the last night it\r\nwould ever stand in its perfect shape. After all, we were full of hope of\r\nfinding out the mystery of its origin.\r\n\r\nThe first attack next morning was most amusing to behold. My husband\r\nheaded the party, looking very tall and slim, with his legs outlined\r\nagainst the sky, as he, with all the rest, in single file and in\r\nfluttering array, wound first round the mound to look for a good place to\r\nascend, and then went straight up.\r\n\r\nThey were all amazed when I appeared and gave orders to the division\r\nunder my command.\r\n\r\nThey looked very questioningly indeed, but, as the Persians had learnt to\r\nrespect me, the Bahreini became quite amenable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEODORE BENT RECEIVING VISITORS AT THE MOUNDS, BAHREIN]\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the mound on which we began our labours were as\r\nfollows: 35 feet in height, 76 feet in diameter, and 152 paces in\r\ncircumference. We chose this in preference to the higher mounds, the\r\ntops of which were flattened somewhat and suggested the idea that they\r\nhad fallen in. Ours, on the contrary, was quite rounded on the summit,\r\nand gave every hope that in digging through it we should find whatever\r\nwas inside in _statu quo_. At a distance of several feet from most of the\r\nmounds are traces of an outer encircling wall or bank of earth, similar\r\nto walls found around certain tombs in Lydia, as also round a tumulus at\r\nTara in Ireland, and this encircling wall was more marked around some of\r\nthe smaller and presumably more recent tombs at the outer edge of the\r\nnecropolis; in some cases several mounds would appear to have been\r\nclustered together, and to have had an encircling wall common to them\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWe dug from the top of our mound for 15 feet, with great difficulty,\r\nthrough a sort of conglomerate earth, nearly as hard as cement, before we\r\nreached anything definite. Then suddenly this close earth stopped, and we\r\ncame across a layer of large loose stones, entirely free from soil, which\r\nlayer covered the immediate top of the tombs for two feet. Beneath these\r\nstones, and immediately on the flat slabs forming the roof of the tomb,\r\nhad been placed palm branches, which in the lapse of ages had become\r\nwhite and crumbly, and had assumed the flaky appearance of asbestos. This\r\nproved that the palm flourished on Bahrein at the date of these tombs,\r\nand that the inhabitants were accustomed to make use of it for\r\nconstructive purposes.\r\n\r\nSix very large slabs of rough unhewn limestone, which had obviously come\r\nfrom Jebel Dukhan, lay on the top of the tomb, forming a roof. One of\r\nthese was 6 feet in length, and 2 feet 2 inches in depth.\r\n\r\nThe tomb itself was composed of two chambers, one immediately over the\r\nother, and approached by a long passage, like the dromos of rock-cut\r\nGreek tombs, which was full of earth and small stones. The entrance, as\r\nwas that of all the tombs, was towards the sunset. This passage was 53\r\nfeet in length, extending from the outer rim of the circle to the mouth\r\nof the tomb. Around the outer circle of the mound itself ran a wall of\r\nhuge stones, evidently to support the weight of earth necessary to\r\nconceal the tomb, and large unhewn stones closed the entrance to the two\r\nchambers of the tomb at the head of the passage.\r\n\r\nWe first entered the upper chamber, the floor of which was covered with\r\ngritty earth. It was 30 feet long, and at the four corners were recesses\r\n2 feet 10 inches in depth, and the uniform height of this chamber was 4\r\nfeet 6 inches. The whole surface of the interior to the depth of two or\r\nthree inches above the other _débris_ was covered with yellow earth\r\ncomposed of the tiny bones of the jerboa, that rat-like animal which is\r\nfound in abundance on the shores of the Persian Gulf. There was no sign\r\nof any recent ones and only a few fragments of skulls to show what this\r\nyellow earth had been. We then proceeded to remove the rubbish and sift\r\nit for what we could find.\r\n\r\nThe chief objects of interest consisted in innumerable fragments of\r\nivory, fragments of circular boxes, pendants with holes for suspension\r\n(obviously used as ornaments by this primitive race), the torso of a\r\nsmall statue in ivory, the hoof of a bull fixed on to an ivory pedestal,\r\nevidently belonging to a small statue of a bull, the foot of another\r\nlittle statue, and various fragments of ivory utensils. Many of these\r\nfragments had patterns inscribed on them--rough patterns of scales,\r\nrosettes, encircling chains, and the two parallel lines common to so many\r\nivory fragments found at Kameiros, and now in the British Museum. In\r\nfact, the decorations on most of them bear a close and unmistakable\r\nresemblance to ivories found in Phoenician tombs on the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and to the ivories in the British Museum from Nimrud in\r\nAssyria, universally accepted as having been executed by Phoenician\r\nartists: those cunning workers in ivory and wood whom Solomon employed in\r\nthe building of his temple, and, before the spread of Egyptian and Greek\r\nart, the travelling artists of the world. The ivory fragments we found\r\nwere given into the hands of Mr. A. S. Murray, of the British Museum, who\r\nwrote to my husband as follows: 'I have not the least doubt, judging from\r\nthe incised patterns, from bull's foot, part of a figure, &c., that the\r\nivories are of Phoenician workmanship.'\r\n\r\nThe pottery found in this tomb offered no very distinctive features,\r\nbeing coarse and unglazed, but the numerous fragments of ostrich\r\negg-shells, coloured and scratched with rough patterns in bands, also\r\npointed to a Phoenician origin, or at least to a race of wide\r\nmercantile connection: and in those days the Phoenicians were the only\r\npeople likely to combine in their commerce ostrich egg-shells and ivory.\r\nWe also found small shapeless pieces of oxidised metal, brass or copper.\r\nThere were no human bones in the upper chamber, but those of a large\r\nanimal, presumably a horse.\r\n\r\nThe chamber immediately beneath was much more carefully constructed; it\r\nwas exactly the same length, but was higher, being 6 feet 7 inches, and\r\nthe passage was wider. It was entirely coated with cement of two\r\nqualities, the upper coat being the finest, in which all round the walls\r\nat intervals of two feet were holes sloping inwards and downward. In\r\nsimilar holes, in one of the other tombs we opened, we found traces of\r\nwood, showing that poles on which to hang drapery had been inserted. The\r\nground of this lower chamber was entirely covered with a thin brown earth\r\nof a fibrous nature, in appearance somewhat resembling snuff; it was a\r\nfoot in depth, and evidently the remains of the drapery which had been\r\nhung around the walls. Prior to the use of coffins the Phoenicians\r\ndraped their dead,[6] and amongst this substance we found traces of human\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nThus we were able to arrive at the system of sepulture employed by this\r\nunknown race. Evidently their custom was to place in the upper chamber\r\nbroken utensils and the body of an animal belonging to the deceased, and\r\nto reserve the lower chamber for the corpse enshrouded in drapery. For\r\nthe use of this upper chamber our parallels are curiously enough all\r\nPhoenician. Perrot gives us an example of two-storied tombs in the\r\ncemetery of Amrit, in Phoenicia, where also the bodies were embedded in\r\nplaster to prevent decay prior to the introduction of the sarcophagus,\r\nreminding us of the closely cemented lower chambers in our mounds. A\r\nmound containing a tomb with one chamber over the other was in 1888\r\nobserved in Sardinia, and is given by Della Marmora as of Phoenician\r\norigin. Here, however, the top of the tomb is conical, not flat, as in\r\nour mounds, which would point to a later development of the double\r\nchamber which eventually blossomed forth into the lofty mausolea of the\r\nlater Phoenician epoch, and the grandiose tombs of Hellenic structure.\r\n\r\nAlso at Carthage, that very same year that we were in Bahrein, _i.e._\r\n1889, excavations brought to light certain tombs of the early\r\nPhoenician settlers which also have the double chamber. In answer to\r\nPerrot's assertion that all early Phoenician tombs were _hypogea_, we\r\nmay say that as the Bahrein Islands offered no facility for this method\r\nof sepulture, the closely-covered-in mound would be the most natural\r\nsubstitute.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the tombs we opened a second, and a smaller one of coarser\r\nconstruction, which confirmed in every way the conclusions we had arrived\r\nat in opening the larger tomb. Near the village of Ali, one of the\r\nlargest mounds has been pulled to pieces for the stones. By creeping\r\ninto the cavities opened we were able to ascertain that the chambers in\r\nthis mound were similar to those in the mound we had opened, only they\r\nwere double on both stories, and the upper story was also coated with\r\ncement. Two chambers ran parallel to each other, and were joined at the\r\ntwo extremities.\r\n\r\nSir M. Durand also opened one of the mounds, but unfortunately the roof\r\nof the tomb had fallen in, which prevented him from obtaining any\r\nsatisfactory results; but from the general appearance, it would seem to\r\nhave been constructed on exactly the same lines as our larger one. Hence\r\nwe had the evidence of four tombs to go upon, and felt that these must be\r\npretty fair specimens of what the many thousands were which extended\r\naround us.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: II. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: XVI. iii. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Hist. des langues sémitiques_, ii. 183.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Perrot, _History of Art in Phoenicia_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOUR VISIT TO RUFA'A\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the time that we spent at Ali we had numerous visitors. The first\r\nday came five camels with two riders apiece, and a train of donkeys,\r\nbringing rich pearl merchants from the capital; these sat in a circle and\r\ncomplacently drank our coffee and ate our mixed biscuits, without in any\r\nway troubling us, having apparently come for no other object than to get\r\nthis slender refreshment.\r\n\r\nNext day came Sheikh Mohammed, a young man of seventeen, a nephew of\r\nSheikh Esau, who was about to wed his uncle's daughter, and was talked of\r\nas the heir-apparent to the throne; he was all gorgeous in a white\r\nembroidered robe, red turban, and head rings bound in royal gold. He\r\nplayed with our pistols with covetous eyes, ate some English cake, having\r\nfirst questioned the bazaar-master as to the orthodoxy of its\r\ningredients, and then he promised us a visit next day.\r\n\r\nHe came on the morrow, on a beautifully caparisoned horse, with red\r\ntrappings and gold tassels. He brought with him many followers and\r\nannounced his intention of passing the day with us, rather to our\r\ndistress; but we were appeased by the present of a fat lamb with one of\r\nthose large bushy tails which remind one forcibly of a lady's bustle, and\r\nsuggests that the ingenious milliner who invented these atrocities must\r\nhave taken for her pattern an Eastern sheep. This day 'Prince' Mohammed\r\nhandled the revolver more covetously than ever, and got so far as\r\nexchanging his scarlet embroidered case, with red silk belt and silver\r\nbuckle, for my leathern one.\r\n\r\nSheikh Mohammed was very anxious to see how I could shoot with my\r\nrevolver, so a brown pot containing about half a pint of water was put on\r\na lump of rock as a mark. I was terrified; for I knew if I missed, as I\r\nsurely expected, I should bring great discredit on myself and my nation,\r\nand there was such a crowd! My husband said I must try, and I am sure no\r\none was more astonished than I was that I shattered the pot. If I had not\r\nit would have been said that I only carried the revolver for show.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon a great cavalcade of gazelle huntsmen called upon us. The\r\nfour chief men of these had each a hooded falcon on his arm, and a tawny\r\nPersian greyhound, with long silky tail, at his side. They wore their\r\nsickle-like daggers in their waistbands; their bodies were enveloped in\r\nlong cloaks, and their heads in white cloths bound round with the\r\ncamel-hair straps; they were accompanied by another young scion of the El\r\nKhalifa family, who bestrode a white Arab steed with the gayest possible\r\ntrappings. Thus was this young prince attired: on his head a cashmere\r\nkerchief with gold akkal; he was almost smothered in an orange cloth gown\r\ntrimmed with gold and lined with green, the sleeves of which were very\r\nlong, cut open at the ends and trimmed; over this robe was cast a black\r\ncloth cloak trimmed with gold on the shoulders, and a richly inlaid sword\r\ndangled at his side, almost as big as himself, for he was but an\r\nundersized boy of fifteen. The sportsmen made a very nice group for our\r\nphotography, as did almost everything around us on Bahrein.\r\n\r\nAny excavator would have lost patience with the men of Bahrein with whom\r\nwe had to deal; tickets had to be issued to prevent more men working than\r\nwere wanted, and claiming pay at the end of the day; ubiquity was\r\nessential, for they loved to get out of sight and do nothing; with\r\nunceasing regularity the pipe went round and they paused for a 'drink' at\r\nthe bubble-bubble, as the Arabs express it; morning, noon-tide, and\r\nevening prayers were, I am sure, unnecessarily long. Accidents would\r\nhappen, which alarmed us at first, until we learnt how ready they were to\r\ncry wolf: one man was knocked over by a stone; we thought by his\r\ncontortions some limb must be broken, and we applied vaseline, our only\r\navailable remedy, to the bruise; his fellow-workmen then seized him by\r\nthe shoulders, he keeping his arms crossed the while, shook him well 'to\r\nput the bones right again,' as they expressed it, and he continued his\r\nwork as before.\r\n\r\nThe bazaar-master and the policeman would come and frantically seize a\r\ntool, and work for a few seconds with herculean vigour by way of example,\r\nwhich was never followed. 'Yallah!' 'hurry on' (_i.e._ Oh God);\r\n'Marhabbah!' 'very good,' the men would cry, and they would sing and\r\nscream with a vigour that nearly drove us wild. But for the occasional\r\napplication of a stick by the bazaar-master and great firmness, we should\r\nhave got nothing out of them but noise.\r\n\r\nOne day we had a mutiny because my husband dismissed two men who came\r\nvery late; the rest refused to work, and came dancing round us, shouting\r\nand brandishing spades. One had actually got hold of a naked sword, which\r\nweapon I did not at all like, and I was thankful 'Prince' Mohammed had\r\nnot yet got the revolver. For some time they continued this wild weird\r\ndance, consigning us freely to the lower regions as they danced, and then\r\nthey all went away, so that the bazaar-master had to be sent in search of\r\nother and more amenable men. Evidently Sheikh Esau, when he entrusted us\r\nto the charge of the bazaar-master and sent policemen with us, was afraid\r\nof something untoward happening. Next day we heard that his majesty was\r\ncoming in person with his tents to encamp in our vicinity, and I fancy we\r\nwere in more danger from those men than we realised at the moment, fanned\r\nas they are into hatred of the infidel by the fanatical Wahabi; thirty\r\nyears ago, I was told, no infidel could have ventured into the centre of\r\nBahrein with safety.\r\n\r\nAnother important visitor came on Saturday in the shape of Sheikh\r\nKhallet, a cousin of the ruling chief, with a retinue of ten men, from\r\nRufa'a, an inland village. We sat for awhile on our heels in rows,\r\nconversing and smiling, and finally accepted an invitation from Sheikh\r\nKhallet to visit him at his village, and make a little tour over the\r\nisland. Accordingly, on Sunday morning we started, accompanied by the\r\nbazaar-master, for Rufa'a, and we were not a little relieved to get away\r\nbefore Sheikh Esau was upon us, and escape the formalities which his\r\nroyal presence in our midst would have necessitated.\r\n\r\nWe had an exceedingly hot ride of it, and the wind was so high that our\r\nposition on our donkeys was rendered even more precarious than usual. The\r\ndesert sand whirled around us: we shut our eyes, tied down our hats, and\r\ntried to be patient; for miles our road led through the tumuli of those\r\nmysterious dead, who once in their thousands must have peopled Bahrein;\r\ntheir old wells are still to be seen in the desert, and evidences of a\r\ncultivation which has long ago disappeared. As we approached the edge of\r\nthis vast necropolis the mounds grew less and less, until mere heaps of\r\nstones marked the spot where a dead man lay, and then we saw before us\r\nthe two villages of Rufa'a. Of these, one is known as Rufa'a Shergeh, or\r\nSouth-western Rufa'a; the other, which belongs to the young Prince\r\nMohammed, is called Rufa'a Jebeli. The Rufa'a are much older than\r\nMoharek, or Manamah; they are fortified with castellated walls of mud\r\nbrick. Many of the El Khalifa family reside here in comfortable houses.\r\nSouth-western Rufa'a is quite a big place, and as our arrival became\r\nknown all the village turned out to see us. The advent of an English lady\r\namong them was something too excessively novel: even close-veiled women\r\nforgot their prudery, and peered out from their blue coverings, screaming\r\nwith laughter, and pointing as they screamed to the somewhat appalled\r\nobject of their mirth. 'Hade bibi!' ('there goes the lady'), shouted they\r\nagain and again. No victorious potentate ever had a more triumphant entry\r\ninto his capital than the English 'bibi' had on entering South-western\r\nRufa'a.\r\n\r\nSheikh Khallet was ready to receive us in his _kahwa_ or reception-room,\r\nfurnished solely by strips of matting and a camel-hair rug with coarse\r\nembroidery on it; two pillows were produced for us, and Arabs squatted on\r\nthe matting all round the wall, for it was Sheikh Khallet's morning\r\nreception, or _majilis_, just then, and we were the lions of the\r\noccasion. Our host, we soon learnt, rather to our dismay, was a most\r\nrigid ascetic--a Wahabi to the backbone. He allows of no internal\r\ndecorations in his house; no smoking is allowed, no wine, only perpetual\r\ncoffee and perpetual prayers; our prospects were not of the most\r\nbrilliant. Some of the Wahabi think even coffee wrong. After a while all\r\nthe company left, and Sheikh Khallet intimated to us that the room was\r\nnow our own. Two more large pillows were brought, and rugs were laid\r\ndown; as for the rest we were dependent on our own very limited\r\nresources. We had brought our own sheets with us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE INTERIOR OF SHEIKH SABA'S HOUSE AT RUFA'A, BAHREIN]\r\n\r\nSheikh Saba, who had married Sheikh Khallet's sister, was a great\r\ncontrast to our host; he had been in Bombay and had imbibed in his\r\ntravels a degree of worldliness which ill became a Wahabi. He had filled\r\nhis house, to which he took us, with all sorts of baubles--gilt\r\nlooking-glasses hanging on the walls; coloured glass balls in rows and\r\nrows up to the ceiling, each on a little looking-glass; lovely pillows\r\nand carpets, Zanzibar date baskets, Bombay inlaid chests, El Hasa\r\ncoffee-pots, and a Russian tea-urn--a truly marvellous conglomeration of\r\nthings, which produced on us a wonderful sense of pleasure and repose\r\nafter the bareness of our host's abode. Sheikh Saba wore only his long\r\nwhite shirt and turban, and so unconventional was he that he allowed his\r\nconsort to remain at one end of the room whilst my husband was there.\r\n\r\nThe courtyards of these houses are architecturally interesting: the\r\nSaracenic arch, the rosettes of open-work stucco, the squares of the same\r\nmaterial with intricate patterns--great boons in a hot land to let in the\r\nair without the sun. There is also another contrivance for obtaining air;\r\nin building the house a niche three feet wide is left in the outer wall,\r\nclosed in on the inner side except for about a foot. It is funny to see\r\nthe heads of muffled women peering out of these air-shafts, into which\r\nthey have climbed to get an undisturbed view. Here some of the women wear\r\nthe Arabian _buttra_ or mask, which, while it hides their features, gives\r\ntheir eyes full play. They are very inquisitive. Some of the women one\r\nmeets on Bahrein are highly picturesque when you see them without the\r\ndark-blue covering.\r\n\r\nI was fetched to one harem after the other, always followed by a dense\r\ncrowd, to the apparent annoyance of my hostesses, who, however, seemed\r\npowerless to prevent the intrusion. I saw one woman holding on to the top\r\nof the door and standing on the shoulders of one who was squatting on the\r\nfloor. One good lady grew enraged at the invasion, and threw a cup of hot\r\ncoffee in an intruder's face.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we rode over to Mountainous (and, it might be added,\r\nruinous) Rufa'a.\r\n\r\nIt is built on a cliff, 50 feet above the lowest level of the desert;\r\nfrom here there is a view over a wide, bleak expanse of sand,\r\noccasionally relieved by an oasis, the result of a well and irrigation,\r\nand beyond this the eye rests on Jebel Dukhan, 'the mountain of mist,'\r\nwhich high-sounding name has been given to a mass of rocks in the centre\r\nof Bahrein, rising 400 feet above the plain, and often surrounded by a\r\nsea-fog; for Bahrein, with its low-lying land, is often in a mist. Some\r\nmornings on rising early we looked out of our tent to find ourselves\r\nenveloped in a perfect London fog--our clothes were soaking, the sand on\r\nthe floor of our tent was soft and adhesive; then in an hour the bright\r\norb of heaven would disperse all this, for we were very far south indeed,\r\non the coast of Arabia. Alas! on arrival we found that our young friend\r\nSheikh Mohammed was out, for he had to be in attendance on his uncle,\r\nSheikh Esau, who had just arrived at his tent near our encampment, and he\r\nhad to provide all his uncle's meals; we saw a donkey with a cauldron on\r\nits back large enough to boil a sheep in, large copper trays, and many\r\nother articles despatched for the delectation of the sovereign and his\r\nretinue. Sheikh Mohammed's mother, quite a queenly-looking woman, was\r\nbusying herself about the preparation of these things, and when she had\r\nfinished she invited us to go into the harem. My husband felt the honour\r\nand confidence reposed in him exceedingly, but, alas! all the women were\r\nveiled; all he could contemplate was their lovely hands and feet dyed\r\nyellow with henna, their rich red shirts, their aprons adorned with\r\ncoins, their gold bracelets and turquoise rings. However I assured him\r\nthat with one solitary exception he had lost nothing by not seeing their\r\nfaces. In one corner of the women's room was the biggest bed I ever saw:\r\nit had eight posts, a roof, a fence, a gate, and steps up to it; it is a\r\nsort of daïs, in fact, where they spread their rugs and sleep, and high\r\nenough to lay beds under it too. Occasionally we got a good peep at the\r\nwomen as they were working in the fields, or cutting with semi-circular\r\nsaws the scrub that grows in the desert for their cattle.\r\n\r\nHalf-way between the two Rufa'as we halted at a well, the great point of\r\nconcourse for the inhabitants of both villages. It was evening, and\r\naround it were gathered crowds of the most enchanting people in every\r\npossible costume. Women and donkeys were groaning under the weight of\r\nskins filled with water; men were engaged in filling them, but it seems\r\nto be against the dignity of a male Arab to carry anything. With the\r\nregularity of a steam crane the woodwork of the well creaked and groaned\r\nwith a sound like a bagpipe, as the donkeys toiled up and down their\r\nslope, bringing to the surface the skins of water. It was a truly Arabian\r\nsight, with the desert all around us, and the little garden hard by which\r\nSheikh Saba cultivates with infinite toil, having a weary contest with\r\nthe surrounding sand which invades his enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe sun was getting low when we returned to our bare room at Sheikh\r\nKhallet's, and to our great contentment we were left alone, for our day\r\nhad been a busy one, and a strain on our conversational powers. Our host\r\nhanded us over to the tender mercies of a black slave, Zamzam by name,\r\nwonderfully skilled at cooking with a handful of charcoal on circular\r\nstoves coloured red, and bearing a marked resemblance to the altars of\r\nthe Persian fire-worshippers. He brought us in our dinner: first he\r\nspread a large round mat of fine grass on the floor; in the centre of\r\nthis he deposited a washing basin filled with boiled rice and a bowl of\r\n_ghi_ or rancid grease to make it palatable; before us were placed two\r\ntough chickens, a bowl of dates, and for drink we had a bowl of milk with\r\ndelicious fresh butter floating in it. Several sheets of bread about the\r\nsize and consistency of bath towels were also provided, but no implements\r\nof any kind to assist us in conveying these delicacies to our mouths.\r\nWith pieces of bread we scooped up the rice, with our fingers we managed\r\nthe rest, and we were glad no one was looking on to witness our struggles\r\nsave Zamzam with a ewer of water, with which he washed us after the\r\nrepast was over, and then we put ourselves away for the night.\r\n\r\nVery early next morning we were on the move for our trip across the\r\nisland. The journey would be too long for donkeys, they said, so Sheikh\r\nKhallet mounted us on three of his best camels, with lovely saddles of\r\ninlaid El Hasa work, with two pommels, one in front and one behind, like\r\nlittle pillars, capped and inlaid with silver. We--that is to say my\r\nhusband and I and the bazaar-master--ambled along at a pretty smart pace\r\nacross the desert in the direction of a fishing village called Asker, on\r\nthe east coast of the island, near which were said to exist ancient\r\nremains; these, of course, turned out to be myths, but the village was\r\nall that could be desired in quaintness; the houses were all of bamboo,\r\nand the floors strewn over with little white helix shells; in one of them\r\nwe were regaled with coffee, and found it delicious after our hot ride;\r\nthen we strolled along the shore and marvelled at the bamboo skiffs, the\r\ncuriously-fashioned oars and water casks, the stone anchors, and other\r\nprimitive implements used by this seafaring race. The bazaar-master would\r\nnot let us tarry as long as we could have wished, for he was anxious for\r\nus to arrive before the midday heat at a rocky cave in the 'mountain of\r\nmist,' in the centre of the island. We dismounted from our camels, and\r\nproceeded to examine Jebel Dukhan, an escarped mass of limestone rocks\r\nwith rugged outline and deep caves. From the gentle elevation of the\r\nmisty mountain one gets a very fair idea of the extent and character of\r\nBahrein. The island has been likened to a sheet of silver in a sea of\r\npearl, but it looked to us anything but silvery, and for all the world\r\nlike one of the native sheets of bread--oval and tawny. It is said to be\r\ntwenty-seven miles long and twelve wide at its broadest point. From the\r\nclearness of the atmosphere and the distinctness with which we saw the\r\nsea all around us, it could not have been much more. There are many tiny\r\nvillages dotted about here and there, recognisable only by their nest of\r\npalm trees and their strips of verdure. In the dim distance, to our left,\r\narose the mountains of Arabia; beyond, the flat coast-line of El Hasa,\r\nencircling that wild, mysterious land of Nejd, where the Wahabi dwell--a\r\nland forbidden to the infidel globe-trotter.\r\n\r\nYet another sheikh of the El Khalifa family was introduced to us, by name\r\nAbdullah; he owns the land about here, and having been advised of our\r\ncoming, had prepared a repast for us, much on the lines of the one we had\r\nhad the evening before.\r\n\r\nWe much enjoyed our cool rest and repast in Abdullah's cave, and for two\r\nhours or more our whole party lay stretched on the ground courting\r\nslumber, whilst our camels grazed around. Another sheikh was anxious to\r\ntake us to his house for the night, but we could not remain, as our work\r\ndemanded our return to camp that night, so we compromised matters by\r\ntaking coffee with him on a green oasis near his house, under a blazing\r\nsun, without an atom of shade, and without a thing against which to lean\r\nour tired backs. Then we hurried back to Rufa'a, to take leave of our\r\nfriend, Sheikh Khallet, and started off late in the evening for our home.\r\n\r\nSoon we came in sight of Sheikh Esau's tent; his majesty was evidently\r\nexpecting us, for by his side in the royal tent were placed two high\r\nthrones, formed of camel saddles covered with sheepskins, for us to sit\r\nupon, whilst his Arabian majesty and his courtiers sat on the ground. As\r\nmany as could be accommodated sat round within the walls of the tent.\r\nThose for whom there was no room inside continued the line, forming a\r\nlong loop which extended for some yards outside the tent. Here all his\r\nnephews and cousins were assembled. That gay youth Sheikh Mohammed, on\r\nordinary occasions as full of fun as an English schoolboy, sat there in\r\ngreat solemnity, incapable of a smile though I maliciously tried to raise\r\none. When he came next morning to visit us he was equally solemn, until\r\nhis uncle had left our tent; then his gaiety returned as if by magic, and\r\nwith it his covetousness for my pistol. Eventually an exchange was\r\neffected, he producing a coffee-pot and an inlaid bowl, which had taken\r\nour fancy, as the price.\r\n\r\nOn the surrounding desert a small gazelle is abundant. One day we came\r\nacross a cavalcade of Bahreini sportsmen, who looked exceedingly\r\npicturesque in their flowing robes and floating red kaffiehs, and riding\r\ngaily caparisoned horses, with crimson trappings and gold tassels. Each\r\nhad on his arm a hooded falcon and by his side a Persian greyhound. When\r\nthe gazelle is sighted the falcon is let loose; it skims rapidly along\r\nthe ground, attacks the head of the animal, and so confuses it that it\r\nfalls an easy prey to the hounds in pursuit. Albuquerque in his\r\n'Commentaries' says: 'There are many who hunt with falcons about the size\r\nof our goshawks, and take by their aid certain creatures smaller than\r\ngazelles, training very swift hounds to assist the falcon in catching the\r\nprey.'\r\n\r\nIn their ordinary life the Bahrein people still retain the primitiveness\r\nof the Bedouin.\r\n\r\nThere are about fifty villages scattered over the islands, recognisable\r\nfrom a distance by their patch of cultivation and groups of date-palms.\r\nExcept at Manamah and Moharek they have little or nothing to do with the\r\npearl fisheries, but are an exceedingly industrious race of peasants who\r\ncultivate the soil by means of irrigation from the numerous wells with\r\nwhich the island is blessed. There are generally three to six small\r\nwheels attached to the beam, which is across the well, over which the\r\nropes of as many large leathern buckets pass. When these buckets rise\r\nfull they tilt themselves over, the contents is then taken by little\r\nchannels to a reservoir which feeds the dykes, transferred thence to the\r\npalms in buckets raised by the leverage of a date-trunk lightly swung by\r\nropes to a frame, and balanced at one end by a basket of earth into which\r\nit is inserted; it is so light to lift that women are generally employed\r\nin watering the trees.\r\n\r\nTo manure their date-groves they use the fins of a species of ray fish\r\ncalled _awwal_, steeped in water till they are putrid; _awwal_, by the\r\nway, was an ancient name of the Island of Bahrein, perhaps because it was\r\nthe first island of the group in size, _awwal_ in Arabic meaning _first_.\r\n\r\nThe area of fertility is very rich and beautiful; it extends all along\r\nthe north coast of the island, and the fishing village of Nayim, with its\r\nbamboo huts nestling beneath the palm-trees, is highly picturesque; and\r\nall this fertility is due to the number of fresh-water springs which\r\nburst up here from underground, similar, no doubt, to those before\r\nalluded to which spring up in the sea. The Arabs will tell you that these\r\nsprings come straight from the Euphrates, by an underground channel\r\nthrough which the great river flows beneath the Persian Gulf, doubtless\r\nbeing the same legend alluded to by Pliny when he says, 'Flumen per quod\r\nEuphratem emergere putant.' There are many of them--the Garsari well,\r\nUm-i-Shaun, Abu Zeidan, and the Adari, which last supplies many miles of\r\ndate-groves through a canal of ancient workmanship. The Adari well is one\r\nof the great sights of Bahrein, being a deep basin of water 22 yards wide\r\nby 40 long, beautifully clear, and full of prismatic colours. It is said\r\nto come up with such force from underground that a diver is driven back,\r\nand all around it are ruins of ancient date, proving that it was prized\r\nby former inhabitants as a bath. The water is slightly brackish, as is\r\nthat of all these sources, so that those who can afford it send for water\r\nto a well between Rufa'a Jebeli and Rufa'a Shergeh--called Haneini, which\r\nis exceedingly good, and camels laden with skins may be seen coming into\r\nManamah every morning with this treasure. We obtained our water supply\r\nthence. The other well, Abu Zeidan, is situated in the midst of the ruins\r\nknown as Beled-al-Kadim, or 'old town.'\r\n\r\nTwo days later our camp was struck, and our long cavalcade, with\r\nSeid-bin-Omar, the bazaar-master, at its head, returned to Manamah. He\r\nhad ordered for us quite a sumptuous repast at his mansion by the sea,\r\nand having learnt our taste for curiosities, he brought us as presents a\r\nbuckler of camel-skin, his 8-foot-long lance, and a lovely bowl of El\r\nHasa work--that is to say, minute particles of silver inlaid in wonderful\r\npatterns in wood. This inlaying is quite a distinctive art of the\r\ndistrict of Arabia along the north-eastern coast known as El Hasa;\r\ncurious old guns, saddles, bowls, and coffee-pots, in fact everything\r\nwith an artistic tendency, comes from that country.\r\n\r\nThe day following was the great Thursday's Market at Beled-al-Kadim, near\r\nthe old minarets and the wells. Mounted once more on donkeys, we joined\r\nthe train of peasants thither bound; I being as usual the object of much\r\ncriticism, and greatly interfering with the business of the day. One male\r\nstarer paid for his inquisitiveness, by tumbling over a stall of\r\nknick-knacks, and precipitating himself and all the contents to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe minarets and pillars of the old mosques looked down on a strange\r\nscene that day. In the half-ruined, domed houses of the departed race,\r\nstall-holders had pitched their stalls: lanes and cross lanes of\r\nclosely-packed vendors of quaint crockery, newly-cut lucerne, onions,\r\nfish, and objects of European fabric such as only Orientals admire, and\r\namongst all was a compact mass of struggling humanity; but it was easy to\r\nsee that the date-palm and its produce formed the staple trade of the\r\nplace. There were all shapes and sizes of baskets made of palm-leaves,\r\ndates in profusion, fuel of the dried spathes, the male spathes for\r\nfructifying the palm, and palm-leaf matting--the only furniture, and\r\nsometimes the only roofing of their comfortless huts.\r\n\r\nThe costumes were dazzling in their brilliancy and quaintness. It was a\r\nscene never to be forgotten, and one of which a photograph, which I took\r\nfrom a gentle eminence, gives but a faint idea. It was our last scene on\r\nBahrein--a fitting conclusion to our sojourn thereon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMASKAT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSOME HISTORICAL FACTS ABOUT OMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn two separate occasions we visited Maskat. The first time was in 1889\r\non our way to Persia, and the second in 1895 when we were starting for\r\nDhofar, on the journey which I shall describe later.\r\n\r\nOn each occasion we had to reach it by way of India, for like all the\r\nrest of the Persian Gulf Maskat is really an outlying portion of our\r\nIndian Empire. By just crossing a range of mountains in Persia you cross\r\nthe metaphorical watershed between our India and Foreign Offices. At\r\nShiraz you hesitate between India and England. You ask the question,\r\n'Shall I send my letters _viâ_ Bombay, or _viâ_ Russia?' You hasten to\r\nget rid of your rupees, for this is the last place where their merit is\r\nrecognised. North of Shiraz you are in a distinctly foreign country. Our\r\nofficials hail from the Foreign Office and belong to the legation of\r\nTeheran. You are no longer under British protection, you are in the\r\ndominions of the Shah.\r\n\r\nBut so long as you are on the shores of the Gulf you are, so to speak, in\r\nIndia. The officials receive their pay in degenerate rupees instead of\r\npounds sterling, they live in 'bungalows,' they talk of 'tiffin,' and eat\r\ncurry at every meal.\r\n\r\nWe keep a British ship of war in the Gulf. We feel that it is a matter of\r\nthe first importance that those countries should remain under our\r\nprotection, and that the Turks should not build forts at Fao and\r\notherwise interfere with our trade in the Karoun, and that no other power\r\nshould have a foothold thereon. The last generation talked much about a\r\nEuphrates Valley Railway, with its terminus at Koweit; we now hear a\r\ngreat deal about the opening up of the Karoun, but it is the lordship of\r\nthe Gulf which is the chief matter of importance just at present both for\r\nIndia and for ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn this district Maskat is the most important point; the kingdom of Oman,\r\nof which it is nominally the capital, commands the entrance to the Gulf.\r\nIn the ninth century of the Christian era ships trading from Sherif to\r\nChina took in water at Maskat from the wells which still supply the town.\r\nBetween Aden and the Persian Gulf it is the only harbour where ships of\r\nany size can find anchorage, and it may, in fact, be said to play much\r\nthe same part with respect to the Persian Gulf that Aden does to the Red\r\nSea. In many other ways the places are strikingly similar. They are both\r\nconstructed on arid, volcanic rocks, which produce the smallest amount of\r\nverdure and reflect the greatest amount of heat; water in both of them is\r\nthe scarcest of commodities. Of all places in the world Maskat has the\r\nreputation of being the hottest, facing, as it does, the Indian Ocean,\r\nand protected from every cooling breeze by rugged volcanic hills, without\r\na blade of cultivation upon them, and which reflect and intensify the\r\nscorching rays of the burning sun. Aden is said to have but a piece of\r\nbrown paper between it and the infernal fires. Maskat would seem to want\r\neven this meagre protection, and 'gives,' as a Persian poet has expressed\r\nit, 'to the panting sinner a lively anticipation of his future destiny.'\r\n\r\nThe approach to the cove of Maskat is highly striking. Many-coloured\r\nvolcanic rocks of fantastic form protect the horseshoe-shaped harbour,\r\nwhilst behind the white town, as far as the eye can reach, stretch deeply\r\nserrated, arid mountains, which culminate in the heights of Jebel Akhdar,\r\nor the 'Green Mountains,' some fifty miles, as the crow flies, inland,\r\nreaching an elevation of 9,000 feet. We were told that snow sometimes\r\nfalls in the winter-time on Jebel Akhdar, and it rejoices in a certain\r\namount of verdure, from which it derives its name. This range forms the\r\nbackbone of Oman, and at its foot lie Nezweh and Rostok, the old capitals\r\nof the long line of imams of Oman, before Maskat was a place of so much\r\nimportance as it is at present. The streams which come down from these\r\nmountains nowhere reach the sea, but are lost in the deserts, and,\r\nnevertheless, in some places they fertilise oases in the Omani desert,\r\nwhere the vegetation is most luxuriant and fever very rife. Grapes grow\r\non the slopes of Jebel Akhdar, and the inhabitants, despite the\r\nstrictures of Mohammed, both make and drink wine of them, and report says\r\n(how far it is true I know not) that the Portuguese exported thence the\r\nvines to which they gave the name of muscatel. The inhabitants of this\r\nwild range are chiefly Bedou and pastoral, and it is from this quarter\r\nthat the troubles which beset the poor sultan, Feysul, generally emanate.\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Maskat is full of life. The deep blue sea is studded with\r\ntiny craft: canoes painted red, green, and white, steered by paddles,\r\nswarm around the steamer; fishermen paddling themselves about on a plank\r\nor two tied together, or swimming astride of a single one, hawk their\r\nwares from boat to boat. The oars of the larger boats are generally made\r\nwith a flat circular piece of wood fastened on to a long pole, and are\r\nreally more like paddles than oars. In the northern corner lie huddled\r\ntogether large dhows, which, during the north-east monsoons, make the\r\njourney to Zanzibar, returning at the change of the season. Most of these\r\nbelong to Banyan merchants in Maskat, and are manned by Indian sailors.\r\nClose to them is the small steamer _Sultanieh_, which was presented by\r\nthe Sultan of Zanzibar to his cousin Sultan Tourki of Maskat, now a\r\nperfectly useless craft, which cannot even venture outside the harbour by\r\nreason of the holes in its side. From its mast floats the red banner of\r\nOman, the same flag that Arab boats at Aden fly. It was originally the\r\nbanner of Yemen, to which place the Arabs who rule in Oman trace their\r\norigin; for early in our era, according to Arab tradition, Oman was\r\ncolonised and taken possession of by descendants of the old Himyarites of\r\nYemen.\r\n\r\nThe shore of the town is very unpleasant, reeking with smells, and at low\r\ntide lined with all the refuse and offal of the place. At high tide\r\nshoals of fish come in to feed on this refuse, and in their train follow\r\nimmense flocks of seagulls, which make the edge of the water quite white\r\nas they fly along and dive after their prey. Here and there out of the\r\nsand peep the barrels of some rusty old cannon, ghostly relics of the\r\nPortuguese occupation.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the beach is the sultan's palace, but it is immeasurably\r\ninferior to the new residency of the British political agent, which\r\nstands at the southern extremity of the town, just where it can get all\r\nthe breeze that is to be had through a gap in the rocks opening to the\r\nsouth; here we were most hospitably entertained by Colonel Hayes Sadler\r\non our second sojourn. Even in this favoured position the heat in summer\r\nis almost unendurable, making Maskat one of the least coveted posts that\r\nthe Indian Government has at its disposal. The cliffs immediately round\r\nthe town are of a shiny schist, almost impossible to walk upon, and\r\nreflect the rays of the sun with great intensity.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the town stand two old Portuguese forts kept up and\r\nmanned by the sultan's soldiers; in them are still to be seen old rusty\r\npieces of ordnance, one of which bears a Portuguese inscription with the\r\ndate 1606, and the name and arms of Philip III. of Spain; also the small\r\nPortuguese chapel in the fort is preserved and bears the date of 1588.\r\nThese are the principal legacies left to posterity by those intrepid\r\npioneers of civilisation in a spot which they occupied for nearly a\r\ncentury and a half. These forts testify to having been of great size and\r\nstrength in former times, and show considerable architectural features,\r\nand the traces of a luxuriant and opulent population.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the ancient history of Oman, there is little known. The\r\nempire of the Himyarites, which filled Yemen and the Hadhramout valley\r\nwith interesting remains, does not appear to have extended its sway so\r\nfar eastward; no Sabæan remains have as yet been found in Oman, nor are\r\nthere any that I have heard of further east than the frankincense country\r\nof Dhofar, over six hundred miles west of Maskat. Neither Ptolemy nor the\r\nauthor of the 'Periplus' gives us any definite information about the\r\nexistence of a town in the harbour of Maskat, and consequently the first\r\nreliable information we have to go upon is from the early Arabian\r\ngeographers.\r\n\r\nFrom Torisi we learn that Sobar was the most ancient town of Oman; but\r\nthat in his day Maskat was flourishing, and that 'in old times the China\r\nships used to sail from there.'\r\n\r\nOman was included in Yemen by these earlier geographers, doubtless from\r\nthe fact that Arabs from Yemen were its first colonisers; but all that is\r\nknown with any certainty is that, from the ninth century a.d. a long line\r\nof imams ruled over Oman, with their capitals at Nezweh or Rostok, at the\r\nfoot of Jebel Akhdar. This title, by which the Arab rulers were known,\r\nhad been conferred on the Arab rulers of Oman for centuries, and\r\nsignifies a sort of priest-king, like Melchisedek, to whom, curiously\r\nenough, is given the same title in the Koran. The election was always by\r\npopular acclamation, and inasmuch as the Omani do not recognise the two\r\n'imams' who immediately succeeded Mohammed, but chose their own, they\r\nform a separate sect. In olden days the men of Oman were called\r\n'outsiders' by their Mohammedan brethren, because they recognised their\r\nown chief solely as the head of their own religion, and are known\r\notherwise as the Ibadiet or Ibadhuyah, followers of Abdullah-bin-Ibadh,\r\nas distinct from the Shiahi (Shiites) and Sunni, between which sects the\r\nrest of Islam is pretty equally divided. Internecine wars were always\r\nrife amongst them; but, at the same time, these early Omani had little or\r\nno intercourse with the outer world. Of the internal quarrels of the\r\ncountry, the Omani historian Salid-bin-Ragik has given a detailed\r\naccount, but for the rest of the world they are of little interest. In\r\nthose days Oman seems to have had two ports, Sur and Kalhat, on the\r\nIndian Ocean, which were more frequented than Maskat. Marco Polo, 1280\r\na.d., calls the second Calaiati in his 'Journal,' and describes it as 'a\r\nlarge city in a gulf called, also, Calatu,' and the Omani paid tribute to\r\nthe melek or king of Hormuz for many generations, but with the rise of\r\nMaskat, Sur and Kalhat declined.\r\n\r\nOman first came into immediate contact with Europeans in the year 1506,\r\nwhen Albuquerque appeared in Maskat harbour bent on his conquest of the\r\nPersian Gulf, and with the object, not even yet accomplished, of making a\r\nroute to India by way of the Euphrates valley. From Albuquerque's\r\n'Commentaries' we get a graphic description of the condition of the\r\ncountry when he reached it.\r\n\r\nAt first the Arabs were inclined to receive the Portuguese without a\r\nstruggle; but, taking courage from the presence of a large army of\r\nBedouin in the vicinity, they soon showed treacherous intentions towards\r\nthe invaders, so that the Portuguese admiral determined to attack the\r\ntown and destroy it, and the commentator states that 'within were burned\r\nmany provisions, thirty-four ships in all, large and small, many fishing\r\nbarks, and an arsenal full of every requisite for ship-building.'\r\n\r\nAfter effecting a landing, the Portuguese ordered 'three gunners with\r\naxes to cut the supports of the mosque, which was a large and very\r\nbeautiful edifice, the greater part being built of timber finely carved,\r\nand the upper part of stucco,' and it was accounted a propitious miracle\r\nby the Portuguese that the men who performed this deed were not killed by\r\nthe falling timber. Maskat was then burnt and utterly destroyed; and\r\n'having cut off the ears and noses of the prisoners he liberated them.'\r\nThe commentator concludes his remarks on Maskat as follows: 'Maskat is of\r\nold a market for carriage of horses and dates; it is a very elegant town,\r\nwith very fine houses. It is the principal _entrepôt_ of the kingdom of\r\nOrmuz, into which all the ships that navigate these parts must of\r\nnecessity enter.'\r\n\r\nThe hundred and forty years during which the Portuguese occupied Maskat\r\nand the adjacent coast town was a period of perpetual trouble and\r\ninsurrection. The factory and forts of Jellali and Merani were commenced\r\nin 1527, but the forts in their present condition were not erected till\r\nafter the union of Portugal and Spain, in 1580; the order for their\r\nerection came from Madrid, and the inscription bears the date 1588. Not\r\nonly were the Arabs constantly on the look-out to dislodge their\r\nunwelcome visitors, but the Turks attacked them likewise, with a navy\r\nfrom the side of the Persian Gulf, and the naval victory gained by the\r\nPortuguese off Maskat in 1554 is considered by Turkish historians to\r\nhave been a greater blow to their power than the better known battle off\r\nPrevesa in 1538, when D'Oria defeated Barbarossa and obliged Solyman to\r\nrelinquish his attempt on Vienna.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the union of Portugal with Spain, the colonial activity of\r\nthe former country declined, the colonies in the Persian Gulf fell one by\r\none into the hand of the Persians and Arabs.\r\n\r\nOut of the kingdom of Oman they were driven in 1620, and confined to the\r\ntown of Maskat by the victorious imam, Nasir-bin-Murshid, during whose\r\nreign of twenty-six years the legend is told that no man in Oman died a\r\nnatural death. Two years later they were also driven from Maskat itself,\r\nand those two forts Jellali and Merani which they had built, the last\r\nfoothold of the Portuguese on the Omani territory, were taken from them.\r\n\r\nThe historian Salil tells the amusing story of the final fall of Maskat\r\ninto the hands of the Arabs. The Portuguese governor, Pereira, was deeply\r\nenamoured of the daughter of a Banyan merchant of Maskat; the man at\r\nfirst refused to let him have his daughter, but at length consented, on\r\ncondition that the wedding did not take place for some months. Pereira\r\nwas now entirely in the hands of the Banyan and did everything he told\r\nhim; so the crafty Indian communicated with the Arabs outside Portuguese\r\nterritory, telling them to be ready when due notice was given to attack\r\nthe town. He then proceeded to persuade Pereira to clean out the water\r\ntanks of the fort, and to clear out the old supplies of food preparatory\r\nto revictualling them; then, when the forts were without food and water,\r\nand finally having damped all the powder, he gave notice to the Arabs,\r\nwho attacked and took the town on a Sunday evening, when the Portuguese\r\nwere carousing.\r\n\r\nCaptain Hamilton gives another account in his travels,[7] and tells us\r\nthat the Arabs were exasperated by a piece of pork, wrapped up in paper,\r\nbeing sent as a present to the imam by the governor, Pereira, and he also\r\nadds that the Portuguese were all put to the sword, save eighteen, who\r\nembraced Mohammedanism; and that the Portuguese cathedral was made the\r\nimam's palace, where he took up his residence for a month or two every\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSince those days these two forts have been regularly used by rival\r\nclaimants to the sovereignty of Oman as convenient points of vantage from\r\nwhich to pepper one another, to the infinite discomfiture of the\r\ninhabitants beneath.\r\n\r\nThe departure of the Portuguese did not greatly benefit the Omani.\r\nWriting in 1624 to the East India Company, Thomas Kerridge speaks of\r\nMaskat as 'a beggarly, poor town,' and 'Ormusz,' he says, 'is become a\r\nheap of ruins.' At last, in 1737, owing to the jealousies of the rival\r\nimams, Seid and Ibn Murshad, Maskat was taken by the Persians. They were,\r\nhowever, soon driven out again by Ahmed-bin-Sayid, or Saoud, a man of\r\nhumble origin but a successful general; as a reward for his services he\r\nwas elected imam in 1741, and was the founder of the dynasty which still\r\nrules there.\r\n\r\nThe successors of Ahmed-bin-Sayid found the obligations of being imam,\r\nand the oath which it entailed to fight against the infidel, both awkward\r\nand irksome, so his grandson, Saoud, who succeeded in 1779, never assumed\r\nthe title of imam, but was content with that of sultan, and consequently\r\nthe imamate of Oman has, with one short exception, been in abeyance ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nUnder the first rulers of this dynasty Oman became a state of\r\nconsiderable importance. During the reigns of Sultan Saoud and his son\r\nSultan Saoud Sayid, a large part of the Arabian mainland was under the\r\nrule of Oman, as also Bahrein, Hormuz, Larij, Kishm, Bandar Abbas, many\r\nislands and their pearl fisheries, and Linga, also a good part of the\r\ncoast of Africa; and it was they who established the alliances with\r\nEngland and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first political relations between the East India Company and the\r\nruler of Oman took place in 1798, the object being to secure the alliance\r\nof Oman against the Dutch and French. A second treaty was made two years\r\nlater, and it was provided in it that 'an English gentleman of\r\nrespectability on the part of the Honourable East India Company, should\r\nalways reside at the port of Maskat.'\r\n\r\nAn English gentleman of respectability has consequently resided there\r\never since, and from the days of Sultan Sayid has become the chief factor\r\nin the government of the place.\r\n\r\nSultan Sayid-bin-Sayid stands out prominently as the great ruler of Oman,\r\nand under his rule Oman and its capital, Maskat, reached the greatest\r\npitch of eminence to be found in all its annals. He ascended the throne\r\nin 1804, and reigned for fifty-two years.\r\n\r\nHe found his country in dire distress at the time of his accession, owing\r\nto the attacks of the fanatical Wahabi from Central Arabia, who had\r\ncarried their victorious arms right down to Maskat, and had imposed their\r\nbigoted rules and religious regulations on the otherwise liberal-minded\r\nMohammedans of Eastern Arabia. With Turkish aid on the one hand, and\r\nBritish support on the other, Sultan Sayid succeeded in relieving his\r\ncountry from these terrible scourges, and drove them back into the\r\ncentral province of Nejd, from which they had carried their bloodthirsty\r\nand fanatical wars over nearly the whole of the peninsula, and, when all\r\nfear from the Wahabi was over, Sultan Sayid extended his conquests in all\r\ndirections. He occupied several points on the Persian Gulf and the\r\nopposite coast of Beluchistan, and materially assisted the Indian\r\nGovernment in putting down the piracy which had for long closed the Gulf\r\nto all trade; and finally, in 1856, he added the important Arab\r\nsettlement of Mombasa and Zanzibar, on the African coast, to his\r\ndominion.\r\n\r\nDuring this long reign Maskat prospered exceedingly. It was the great\r\ntrade centre for the Persian Gulf, inasmuch as it was a safe depôt, where\r\nmerchants could deposit their goods without fear of piracy; vessels going\r\nto and from India before the introduction of steam used frequently to\r\nstop at Maskat for water. As a trade centre in those days it was almost\r\nas important as Aden, and with the Indian Government Sultan Sayid was\r\nalways on most friendly terms.\r\n\r\nWhen Sultan Sayid died, the usual dispute took place between his\r\nsuccessors. England promptly stepped in to settle this dispute, and, with\r\nthe foresight she so admirably displays on such occasions, she advocated\r\na division of Sayid's empire. Zanzibar was given to one claimant, Oman to\r\nthe other, and for the future Oman and Sultan Tourki remained under\r\nBritish protection.\r\n\r\nSince the death of Sultan Sayid the power of Oman has most lamentably\r\ngone down, partly owing to the very success of his attempts to put down\r\npiracy; this, followed by the introduction of steam, has diminished the\r\nimportance of Maskat as a safe port for the merchants to deposit their\r\nwares. It is also partly due to the jealousies which prevail between the\r\ndescendants of Sayid who rule in Zanzibar and in Maskat. Palgrave in 1863\r\ndescribes Maskat as having 40,000 inhabitants; there are probably half\r\nthat number now.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan of Zanzibar has to pay an annual tribute of 40,000 crowns to\r\nhis relative of Maskat in order to equalise the inheritance, and this\r\ntribute being a constant source of trouble, of late years he has taken to\r\nurging the wild Bedouin tribes in Oman to revolt against the present,\r\nrather weak-minded sultan who reigns there. He supplies them with the\r\nsinews of war, namely money and ammunition, and the insurrection which\r\noccurred in February 1895 was chiefly due to this motive power.\r\n\r\nOne of his sisters married a German, the English conniving at her escape\r\nfrom Zanzibar in a gunboat. On her husband's death, her elder brother\r\nhaving in the meantime also died, she returned to Zanzibar thinking her\r\nnext brother, the present sultan, to be of a milder disposition, but he\r\nrefused to take any notice of her and her children.\r\n\r\nThe present ruler of Maskat, Sultan Feysul, is a grandson of Sultan Sayid\r\nand son of Sultan Tourki by an Abyssinian mother. Since his accession, in\r\n1889, he has been vacillating in his policy; he has practically had but\r\nlittle authority outside the walls of Maskat, and were it not for the\r\nsupport of the British Government and the proximity of a gunboat, he\r\nwould long ago have ceased to rule. When we first saw him, in 1889, he\r\nwas but a beardless boy, timid and shy, and now he has reached man's\r\nestate he still retains the nervous manner of his youth. He lives in\r\nperpetual dread of his elder brother Mahmoud, who, being the son of a\r\nnegress, was not considered a suitable person to inherit the throne. The\r\ntwo brothers, though living in adjacent houses, never meet without their\r\nown escorts to protect them from each other.\r\n\r\nThe way in which Feysul obtained possession of the Sultan's palace on his\r\nfather's death, to the exclusion of his brother, is curious.\r\n\r\nFeysul said his grief for his father was so great that his feelings would\r\nnot admit of his attending the funeral, so he stayed at home while\r\nMahmoud went, who on his return found the door locked in his face.\r\n\r\nThe palace is entered by a formidable-looking door, decorated with large\r\nspiked bosses of brass. This opens into a small court which contained at\r\nthe time of our first visit the most imposing sight of the place, namely\r\nthe lion in his cage to the left, into which Feysul was in the habit of\r\nintroducing criminals of the deepest dye, to be devoured by this lordly\r\nexecutioner. Opposite to this cage of death is another, a low\r\nprobationary cage, which, when we were there, contained a prisoner\r\nstretched out at full length, for the cage is too low to admit of a\r\nsitting posture. From this point he could view the horrors of the lion's\r\ncage, so that during his incarceration he might contemplate what might\r\nhappen to him if he continued, on liberation, to pursue his evil ways.\r\nAnother door leads into a vaulted passage full of guards, through which\r\nwe passed and entered into an inner court with a pool in the centre and a\r\nwide cloister around it supporting a gallery.\r\n\r\nSultan Feysul was then a very young man, not much over twenty. He was\r\ngreatly interested in seeing us, for we were the first English travellers\r\nwho had visited him since his accession. We caught sight of him peeping\r\nat us over the balcony as we passed through the courtyard below, and we\r\nhad to clamber up a ladder to the gallery, where we found him ready to\r\nwelcome us. He seized our hands and shook them warmly, and then led us\r\nwith much effusiveness to his _khawah_, a long room just overhanging the\r\nsea, which is his reception and throne-room. Here were high,\r\ncane-bottomed chairs around the walls, and at one end a red chair, which\r\nis the throne; just over it were hung two grotesque pictures of our Queen\r\nand the Prince Consort, such as one could buy for a penny at a fair. They\r\nare looked upon as objects of great value here, and act as befitting\r\nsymbols of our protectorate.\r\n\r\nThe imam fed us with sweets and coffee, asked us innumerable questions,\r\nand seemed full of boyish fun. Certainly with his turban of blue and red\r\nchecked cotton (which would have been a housemaid's duster at home), his\r\nfaded, greenish yellow cloak, fastened round his slender frame by a red\r\ngirdle, he looked anything but a king. As we were preparing to depart the\r\nyoung monarch grew apparently very uneasy, and impatiently shouted\r\nsomething to his attendants, and when the servant came in, Feysul hurried\r\nto him, seized four little gilt bottles of attar of roses, thrust two of\r\nthem into each of our pockets, and with some compliments as to our Queen\r\nhaving eyes everywhere, and Feysul's certainty that she would look after\r\nhim, the audience was at an end.\r\n\r\nSultan Feysul was a complete autocrat as far as his jurisdiction\r\nextended. At his command a criminal could be executed either in the\r\nlion's cage or in a little square by the sea, and his body cut up and\r\nthrown into the waves. The only check upon him was the British Resident.\r\nHis father, Tourki, not long before sewed up a woman in a sack and\r\ndrowned her, whereupon a polite message came from the Residency\r\nrequesting him not to do such things again. Hence young Feysul dared not\r\nbe very cruel--to offend the English would have been to lose his\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nHis half brother, Mahmoud, whose mother was a Swahili, lives next door to\r\nhis brother, Sultan Feysul, in the enjoyment of a pension of 600 dollars\r\na mouth. The uncles, however, are not so amenable. The eldest of them,\r\naccording to Arabian custom, claimed the throne and had collected an army\r\namongst the Bedouin to assert his claims, and was then in possession of\r\nall the country, with the exception of Maskat and El Matra, for Feysul\r\nhad no money, and hence he could not get his soldiers to fight. But then\r\nit had been intimated to Feysul that in all probability the English would\r\nsupport his claims if he conducted himself prudently and wisely. So\r\nthere was every likelihood that in due course he would be thoroughly\r\nestablished in the dominions of his father.\r\n\r\nWhen we visited the town for the second time an even more serious\r\nrebellion was impending, the Bedouin of the interior, under Sheikh Saleh,\r\nhaving attacked Maskat itself. The sultan and his brother, who hastily\r\nbecame friends, retired together to the castle, and the town was given up\r\nto plunder. There were dead bodies lying on the beach, and but for the\r\nkindness of Colonel Hayes Sadler, the British Resident, there would have\r\nbeen difficulties in the fort as regards water. They relied principally\r\non H.M.S. _Sphinx_, which lay in the harbour to protect British\r\ninterests, and to maintain Sultan Feysul in his position.\r\n\r\nThis state of terror lasted three weeks, when the rebels, having looted\r\nthe bazaars and wrecked the town, were eventually persuaded to retire,\r\nfree and unpunished, with a considerable cash payment; probably intending\r\nto return for more when the cooler weather should come, and the date\r\nharvest be over. With the consent of, and at the request of, the Indian\r\nGovernment, Sultan Feysul has imposed additional heavy duty on all the\r\nproduce coming in from the rebel tribes, that he may have a fund from\r\nwhich to pay indemnities to foreigners who suffered loss during the\r\ninvasion. A good many Banyan merchants, British subjects, suffered\r\nlosses, and their claim alone amounted to 120,000 rupees. As a natural\r\nresult of this disaster and its ignominious termination, Sultan Feysul's\r\nauthority at the present moment is absolutely _nil_ outside the walls of\r\nMaskat and El Matra, and he is still in a state of declared war with all\r\nthe Bedouin chiefs in the mountains behind Maskat.\r\n\r\nA few British subjects were scared, but not killed, and as all was over\r\nin a few weeks no one thought much more about it except those more\r\nimmediately interested, and few paused to think what an important part\r\nMaskat has played in the opening up of the Persian Gulf and the\r\nsuppression of piracy, and what an important part it may yet play should\r\nthe lordship of the Persian Gulf ever become a _casus belli_.\r\n\r\nAlthough Maskat has been under Indian influence for most of this century,\r\nit has latterly gone down much in the world; the trade of the place has\r\nwell-nigh departed, and with a weak sultan at the head of affairs,\r\nconfidence will be long in returning. Unquestionably our own Political\r\nAgent may be said to be the ruler in Maskat, and his authority is\r\ngenerally backed up by the presence of a gunboat. There is also an\r\nAmerican Consul there, who chiefly occupies himself in trade and steamer\r\nagencies, and in 1895 the French also sent a Consul to inquire into the\r\nquestion of the slave trade, which is undoubtedly the burning question in\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nWhilst England has been doing all she can to put slavery down, it is\r\ncomplained that much is carried on under cover of the French flag,\r\nobtained by Arab dhows under false pretexts from the French Consul\r\nresident in Zanzibar. Sultan Feysul remonstrated with France on this\r\npoint, and the appointment of a Consul is the result.\r\n\r\nThe great reason for our unpopularity in Arabia is due without doubt to\r\nour suppression of this trade. Slavery is inherent in the Arab; he does\r\nas little work as he can himself, and if he is to have no slaves nothing\r\nwill be done, and he must die. In other parts of South Arabia--Yemen, the\r\nHadhramout, the Mahra country, and Dhofar--slavery is universal; and\r\nthere is no doubt about it the slaves are treated very well and live\r\nhappy lives; but here in Oman, under the very eye of India, slavery must\r\nbe checked. Our gunboat, the _Sphinx_, goes the round of the coast to\r\nprevent this traffic in human flesh, and frequently slaves swim out to\r\nthe British steamer and obtain their liberty. This naturally makes us\r\nvery unpopular in Sur, where the Jenefa tribe have their head-quarters,\r\nthe most inveterate slave-traders of Southern Arabia. The natural result\r\nis that whenever they get a chance the Jenefa tribe loot any foreign\r\nvessel wrecked on their shores and murder the crew. In the summer of\r\n1894, however, a boat was wrecked near Ghubet-el-Hashish, containing some\r\ncreoles from the Seychelle Islands, after being driven for forty-five\r\ndays out of their course by south-east monsoons, during which time three\r\nor four of them had died. The survivors were much exhausted, but the\r\nBedouin treated them kindly, for a wonder, and brought them safely to\r\nMaskat. For doing this they were handsomely rewarded by the Indian\r\nGovernment, though they had kept possession of the boat and its contents;\r\nnevertheless, they had saved the lives of the crew, and this, being a\r\nstep in the right direction, was thought worthy of reward.\r\n\r\nThe jealousies, however, of other tribes were so great that the rescuers\r\ncould not return to their own country by the land route, but had to be\r\nsent to Sur by sea.\r\n\r\nFeysul has had copper coins of his own struck, of the value of a quarter\r\nanna. On the obverse is a picture of Maskat and its forts, around which\r\nin English runs the legend, 'Sultan Feysul-bin-Tourki Sultan and Imam of\r\nMaskat and Oman,' and on the reverse is the Arab equivalent. He has also\r\nintroduced an ice-factory, which, however, is now closed, and he wished\r\nto have his own stamps, principally with a view to making money out of\r\nthem; but our agent represented to him that it was beneath the dignity of\r\nso great a sultan to make money in so mean a way, and the stamps have\r\nnever appeared. Sultan Feysul had done much in the last few years, since\r\nour first visit, to modernise his palace. British influence has abolished\r\nmany horrors and cruelties, and the lion having died has not been\r\nreplaced.\r\n\r\nFor the Indian Government the question of Maskat is by no means pleasant,\r\nfor, should any other Power choose to interfere and establish an\r\ninfluence there, it would materially affect the influence which we have\r\nestablished in the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Pinkerton, vol. viii.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMASKAT AND THE OUTSKIRTS\r\n\r\n\r\nI never saw a place so void of architectural features as the town of\r\nMaskat itself. The mosques have neither domes nor minarets--a sign of the\r\nrigid Wahabi influence which swept over Arabia. This sect refuse to have\r\nany feature about their buildings, or ritual which was not actually\r\nenjoined by Mohammed in his Koran. There are a few carved lintels and\r\ndoorways, and the bazaars are quaintly pretty, but beyond this the only\r\narchitectural features are Portuguese.\r\n\r\nAll traces of the Portuguese rule are fast disappearing, and each new\r\nrevolution adds a little more to their destruction. Three walls of the\r\nhuge old cathedral still stand, a window or two with lattice-work carving\r\nafter the fashion of the country are still left, but the interior is now\r\na stable for the sultan's horses, and the walls are rapidly crumbling\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Maskat is particularly gloomy: the bazaars are narrow and\r\ndirty, and roofed over with palm matting; they offer but little of\r\ninterest, and if you are fond of the Arabian sweetmeat called _halwa_, it\r\nis just as well not to watch it being made there, for niggers' feet are\r\nusually employed to stir it, and the knowledge of this is apt to spoil\r\nthe flavour. Most of the town is now in ruins. Fifty years ago the\r\npopulation must have been nearly three times greater than it is now.\r\nThere is also wanting in the town the feature which makes most Moslem\r\ntowns picturesque, namely the minaret; the mosques of the Ibadhuyah sect\r\nbeing squalid and uninteresting. At first it is difficult to distinguish\r\nthem from the courtyard of an ordinary house, but by degrees the eye gets\r\ntrained to identify a mosque by the tiny substitute for a minaret\r\nattached to each, a sort of bell-shaped cone about four feet high, which\r\nis placed above the corner of the enclosing wall. I have already\r\nmentioned the Ibadhuyah's views with regard to the imams. I believe they\r\nhold also certain heterodox opinions with regard to predestination and\r\nfree will, which detach them from other Moslem communities; at any rate\r\nthey are far more tolerant than other Arabian followers of the Prophet,\r\nand permit strangers to enter their mosques at will. Tobacco is freely\r\nused by them, and amongst the upper classes scepticism is rife. The\r\ndevout followers of Mohammed look upon them much as Roman Catholics look\r\non Protestants, and their position is similar in many respects.\r\n\r\nAs elsewhere in Arabia, coffee is largely consumed in Oman, and no\r\nbusiness is ever transacted without it; it is always served in large,\r\ncopper coffee-pots, of the quaint shape which they use in Bahrein. Some\r\nof these coffee-pots are very large. An important sheikh, or the mollah\r\nof a mosque, whose guests are many, will have coffee-pots two or three\r\nfeet in height, whereas those for private use are quite tiny, but the\r\nbird-like form of the pot is always scrupulously preserved.\r\n\r\nThe bazaars of Oman do not offer much to the curio-hunter. He may\r\nperchance find a few of the curved Omani daggers with handsome sheaths\r\nadorned with filigree silver, to which is usually attached, by a leather\r\nthong, a thorn extractor, an earpick, and a spike. The belting, too, with\r\nwhich these daggers are attached to the body, is very pretty and quite a\r\nspecialty of the place; formerly many gold daggers were manufactured at\r\nMaskat and sent to Zanzibar, but of late years the demand for these has\r\nconsiderably diminished.\r\n\r\nThe iron locks in the bazaars are very curious and old-fashioned, with\r\nhuge iron keys which push out the wards, and are made like the teeth of a\r\ncomb. These locks are exceedingly cumbersome, and seem to me to be a\r\ndevelopment of the wooden locks with wooden wards found in the interior\r\nof Arabia. Some of them are over a foot long. I have seen a householder\r\nafter trying to hammer the key in with a stone, at last in despair climb\r\nover his own garden wall.\r\n\r\nPerchance a shark-skin or wooden buckler may be picked up from a Bedou\r\nfrom the mountains, and there are chances of obtaining the products of\r\nmany nationalities, for Maskat, like Aden, is one of the most\r\ncosmopolitan cities of the East. Here, as in El Matra, you find Banyans\r\nfrom India, Beluchi from the Mekran coast, negroes from Zanzibar,\r\nBedouin, Persians from the Gulf, and the town itself is even less Arab\r\nthan Aden.\r\n\r\nThe ex-prime minister's house, which occupies a prominent position in the\r\nprincipal street, is somewhat more Oriental in character than most, and\r\npossesses a charmingly carved, projecting window, which gladdens the eye;\r\nand here and there in the intricacies of the town one comes across a\r\ncarved door or a carved window, but they are now few and far between.\r\n\r\nThe suburbs of Maskat are especially interesting. As soon as you issue\r\nout of either of the two gates which are constructed in the wall,\r\nshutting the town off from the outer world, you plunge at once into a new\r\nand varied life.\r\n\r\nHere is the fish and provision market, built of bamboos, picturesque, but\r\nreeking with horrible smells and alive with flies; hard by is a stagnant\r\npool into which is cast all the offal and filth of this disgusting\r\nmarket. The water in the pool looks quite putrid, and when the wind\r\ncomes from this quarter no wonder it is laden with fever germs and\r\nmephitic vapours. Consequently, Maskat is a most unhealthy place,\r\nespecially when the atmosphere is damp and rain has fallen to stir up the\r\nrefuse.\r\n\r\nThe women with their mask-veils called _buttra_, not unlike the masks\r\nworn with a domino, pleased us immensely, so that we sought to possess a\r\nspecimen. They brought us several, which, however, did not quite satisfy\r\nus, and afterwards we learnt that an enterprising German firm had made a\r\nlot of these _buttra_ for sale amongst the Maskat women; but the shape\r\nbeing not exactly orthodox, the women will not buy them, so the owners of\r\nthese unsaleable articles are anxious to sell them cheap to any\r\nunsuspecting traveller who may be passing through.\r\n\r\nOutside the walls the sultan is in the habit of distributing two meals a\r\nday to the indigent poor; and inasmuch as the Omani are by nature prone\r\nto laziness, there is but little doubt that his highness's liberality is\r\ngreatly imposed on.\r\n\r\nIn the market outside the walls we lingered until nearly driven wild by\r\nthe flies and the stench, so we were glad enough to escape and pursue our\r\nwalk to the Paradise valley and see the favourable side of Maskat. There\r\nthe sleepy noise of the wells, the shade of the acacias and palms, and\r\nthe bright green of the lucerne fields, refreshed us, and we felt it hard\r\nto realise that we were in arid Arabia.\r\n\r\nAs you emerge you come across a series of villages built of reeds and\r\npalm branches, and inhabited by members of the numerous nationalities who\r\ncome to Maskat in search of a livelihood. Most of these are Beluchi from\r\nthe Mekran coast, and Africans from the neighbourhood of Zanzibar. The\r\ngeneral appearance of these villages is highly picturesque, but squalid.\r\nHere and there palm-trees, almond-trees, and the ubiquitous camelthorn\r\nare seen interspersed amongst the houses; women in red and yellow\r\ngarments, with turquoise rings in their ears and noses, peep at you\r\nfurtively from behind their flimsy doors, and as you proceed up the\r\nvalley you find several towers constructed to protect the gardens from\r\nBedouin incursions, and a few comfortable little villas built by Banyan\r\nmerchants, where they can retire from the heat and dust of Maskat.\r\n\r\nThe gardens are all cultivated, with irrigation, and look surprisingly\r\ngreen and delicious in contrast with the barren, arid rocks which\r\nsurround them; the wells are dug deep in the centre of the valley, in the\r\nbed of what elsewhere would be a river, and are worked by a running slope\r\nand bullocks who draw up and down skin buckets, which, like those in\r\nBahrein, empty themselves automatically into tanks connected with the\r\nchannels which convey the water to the gardens.\r\n\r\nAfter walking for a mile or two up this valley all traces of life and\r\ncultivation cease, and amidst the volcanic rocks and boulders hardly a\r\ntrace of vegetable life is to be seen. It is a veritable valley of\r\ndesolation, and there are many such in waterless Arabia.\r\n\r\nBy ascending paths to the right or to the left of the valley, the\r\npedestrian may reach some exquisite points of view; all the little _cols_\r\nor passes through which these paths lead are protected at the summit by\r\nwalls and forts--not strong enough, however, as recent events have shown,\r\nto keep off the incursions of the Bedouin. The views over Maskat and the\r\nsea are charming, but one view to the south will be for ever impressed on\r\nmy mind as one of the most striking panoramas I have ever seen. When the\r\nsummit of a little pass on the south side of the valley is reached after\r\na walk of about two miles, you look down through a gateway over the small\r\nvalley and fishing village of Sedad, amongst the reed houses of which are\r\nmany palm-trees and a thick palm garden belonging to Sayid Yussuf, which\r\ngives the one thing wanting to views about Maskat, namely, a mass of\r\ngreen to relieve the eye. A deep inlet of the sea runs up here with its\r\nblue waters, and beyond stretch into illimitable space the fantastic\r\npeaks of the Oman mountains, taking every form and shape imaginable;\r\nthese are all rich purples and blues, and the colouring of this view is\r\nsuperb.\r\n\r\nFrom Sedad one can take a boat and row round the headlands back to\r\nMaskat. The promontories to the open sea are very fine: beetling cliffs\r\nof black, red, and green volcanic rocks, and here and there stand up\r\nrocky islets, the home of the cormorant and the bittern. In a small cove,\r\ncalled Sheikh Jabar, half-way between Sedad and Maskat, and accessible\r\nonly by boat (for none but the most active of the natives can scale the\r\noverhanging rocks), is a tiny strand which has been chosen as the\r\nChristian burial-place. There are not very many graves in this weird\r\nspot, and most of them are occupied by men from the gunboats which have\r\nbeen stationed at Maskat. Among them is the grave of Bishop French, who\r\ncame to Maskat some years ago with the object of doing missionary work\r\namongst the Omani, but he fell a sacrifice to the pernicious climate\r\nbefore he had been long at his post, and before he had succeeded in\r\nmaking any converts.\r\n\r\nAbout three miles from Maskat lies the town of El Matra, the commercial\r\ncentre of the kingdom of Oman. It would be the seat of government also\r\nwere it not exposed to the southern winds. The journey is nearly always\r\nmade by sea; it takes much longer to go by land, for a ridge of hills has\r\nto be crossed. In a canoe it is only half an hour's paddle, and when the\r\nweather is favourable the canoe owners drive a rattling trade. The\r\ncanoes, which they call _houris_, are hollowed out of a tree trunk,\r\ndouble-prowed, and with matting at the bottom. They are not very stable\r\nand make one think unpleasantly of sharks.\r\n\r\nYou pass the Fahl, or Stallion Rock, in the harbour, a name constantly\r\ngiven by Arabs to anything large and uncanny looking, and turning sharp\r\nround a rocky corner you see before you El Matra.\r\n\r\nThe town is governed by a _wali_ chosen by the imam, and in the bazaars\r\nmay be seen, in hopeless confusion, Banyans from India, Omani, Bedouin,\r\nPersians and Jews. These nationalities have each their separate wards for\r\nliving in, walled off to keep them from perpetual brawls, and they only\r\nmeet one another in the bazaars, where the eye of the bazaar-master is\r\nupon them, ready to inflict condign punishment on disturbers of the\r\npeace, in which cases the innocent more frequently suffer than the\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\nThe Monday's market is filled with quaint countryfolk, bringing in\r\nbaskets of fruit and wearing the upper garment of red cotton and the\r\nlarge white girdle and turban.\r\n\r\nAt El Matra live most of the richest merchants, and it is the point from\r\nwhich all the caravan roads into the interior start; it, too, has a\r\nPortuguese castle, and presents a much more alluring frontage than\r\nMaskat. In a nice-looking house by the shore dwelt Dr. Jayakar, an Indian\r\ndoctor, who had lived for twenty-five years at Maskat, combining the post\r\nof British Vice-Consul with that of medical adviser to the few Europeans\r\nwho dwell there. He said he preferred Maskat to any other place in the\r\nworld, and hoped to end his days there; he was a great naturalist, and\r\nhis house was filled with curious animals from the interior, and marvels\r\nfrom the deep. He showed us specimens of a rabbit-like animal which the\r\nArabs call 'whabba,' and which he affirmed is the coney of the Bible, and\r\nof the oryx, which lives up on the Jebel Akhdar; it has two straight\r\nhorns which for one instant and from one point of view when it is\r\nrunning sideways look like one, and some say the fact gave rise to the\r\nmythical unicorn.\r\n\r\nIt is, to say the least of it, a great disadvantage to have your medical\r\nman at El Matra when you are ill at Maskat; if the weather is stormy\r\nboats cannot go between the two places. There is a troublesome road\r\nacross the headland by which the doctor can come, partly by water and\r\npartly on foot, in case of dire necessity, but the caravan road, entirely\r\nby land, goes a long way inland, and would take the medical man all day\r\nto traverse. Behind El Matra are pleasant gardens, watered by irrigation,\r\nwhich produce most of the fruit and vegetables consumed in these parts.\r\n\r\nDuring our fortnight's stay at Maskat in 1895, we frequently in the\r\nevening coolness rowed about the harbour and examined its bays and\r\npromontories. The energetic crews of numerous gunboats of various\r\nnationalities stationed here at different times have beguiled their time\r\nby illuminating the bare cliffs with the names of their ships in large\r\nletters done in white paint. French, Russian, Italian, and German names\r\nare here to be read, but by far the largest number are in English. The\r\nrocks at the mouth of the harbour are literally covered with delicious\r\noysters, and one of our entertainments was at low tide to land on these\r\nrocks and get our boatmen to detach as many of the shellfish as we could\r\nconveniently consume.\r\n\r\nSuch is Maskat as it exists to-day, a spot which has had a varied history\r\nin the past, and the future of which will be equally interesting to those\r\nwho have any connection with the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF\r\n\r\nHADRAMUT.\r\n\r\nSurveyed by Imam Sharif, Khan Bahadur.\r\n\r\nto illustrate the explorations of\r\n\r\nM^r.

In 1846 Von Wrede made a bold attempt to reach it, but\r\nonly got as far as the collateral valley of Doan. My husband and I were\r\nthe first to attempt (in the latter part of 1893 and the early part of\r\n1894) this journey without any disguise, and with a considerable train of\r\nfollowers, and I think, for this very reason, that we went openly, we\r\nmade more impression on the natives, and were able to remain there longer\r\nand see more, than might otherwise have been the case, and to establish\r\nrelations with the inhabitants which, I hope, will hereafter lead to very\r\nsatisfactory results.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at Aden with letters of recommendation to the Resident\r\nfrom the Indian Government and the India Office, besides private\r\nintroductions, we were amazed at all the difficulties thrown in our way.\r\nIt quite appeared as if we had left our native land to do some evil deed\r\nto its detriment, and we were made to feel how thoroughly degrading it is\r\nto take up the vocation of an archæologist and explorer.\r\n\r\nMany strange and unexpected things befell us, but the most remarkable of\r\nall was that when a certain surgeon-captain asked for leave to accompany\r\nus, it was refused to him on the ground that 'Mr. Theodore Bent's\r\nexpedition was not sanctioned by Government,' in spite of the fact that\r\nthe Indian Government had actually placed at my husband's disposal a\r\nsurveyor, Imam Sharif, Khan Bahadur. We had no assistance beyond two very\r\ninferior letters to the sultans of Makalla and Sheher, which made them\r\nthink we were 'people of the rank of merchants,' they afterwards said.\r\n\r\nImam Sharif has travelled much with Englishmen, so he speaks our language\r\nperfectly, and having a keen sense of humour, plenty of courage and tact,\r\nand no Mohammedan prejudices, we got on splendidly together. He was a\r\nvery agreeable member of the party. My husband paid all his expenses from\r\nQuetta _viâ_ Bombay, with three servants, including their tents and camp\r\nequipage, and back to Quetta.\r\n\r\nOur party was rather a large one, for besides ourselves and our faithful\r\nGreek servant Matthaios, who has accompanied us in so many of our\r\njourneys, we had with us not only the Indians, but a young gardener from\r\nKew, William Lunt by name, as botanist, and an Egyptian named Mahmoud\r\nBayoumi, as naturalist, sent by Dr. Anderson, whose collections are now\r\nin the British Museum of Natural History at South Kensington.\r\n\r\nThe former was provided with all the requisites for digging up forest\r\ntrees, and Mahmoud had with him all that was necessary for pickling and\r\npreserving large mammals, for no one knew what might be found in the\r\nunknown land; and many were the volunteers to join the party as hunters,\r\nwho promised to keep us in game, whereas if they had come they would only\r\nhave found reptiles.\r\n\r\nAs interpreter was recommended to us by the native political agent at\r\nAden, Saleh Mohammed Jaffer, Khan Bahadur--a certain Saleh Hassan. He\r\nproved to be a fanatical Moslem, whose only object seemed to be to\r\nterrify us and to raise enemies against us, in order to prevent our\r\ntrampling the holy land where Mohammed was born. Throughout our journey\r\nhe was a constant source of difficulty and danger.\r\n\r\nOur starting-point for the interior was Makalla, which is 230 miles from\r\nAden, and is the only spot between Aden and Maskat which has any\r\npretensions to the name of port. The name itself means 'harbour.' It is\r\nfirst mentioned by Ibn Modjawir; Hamdani calls it El Asa-Lasa, and Masudi\r\ngives the name as Lahsa. The harbour is not available during the\r\nsouth-west monsoon, and then all the boats go off to Ras Borum or the\r\nBasalt Head.\r\n\r\nHere we were deposited in December 1893 by a chance steamer, one which\r\nhad been chartered and on which for a consideration we were allowed to\r\ntake passage. I took turns with the captain to sleep in his cabin, but\r\nthere was nothing but the deck for the others.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the town rise grim, arid mountains of a reddish hue,\r\nand the town is plastered against this rich-tinged background. By the\r\nshore, like a lighthouse, stands the white minaret of the mosque, the\r\nwalls and pinnacles of which are covered with dense masses of sea-birds\r\nand pigeons; the gate of this mosque, which is really nearly in the sea,\r\nis blocked up by tanks, so that no one can enter with unwashed feet. Not\r\nfar from this rises the huge palace where the sultan dwells, reminding\r\none of a whitewashed mill; white, red, and brown are the dominant colours\r\nof the town, and in the harbour the Arab dhows, with fantastic sterns,\r\nrock to and fro in the unsteady sea, forming altogether a picturesque and\r\nunusual scene.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Bab Assab are huts where dwell the Bedouin who come from the\r\nmountains. They are not allowed to sleep within the town. There is a\r\npraying-place just outside the gate. In the middle of the town is a great\r\ncemetery full of tamarisks, and containing the sacred tomb of the sainted\r\nWali Yakoub in the centre.\r\n\r\nWe were amused by a dance at a street corner to the beating of drums. It\r\nconsisted of a hot, seething mass of brown bodies writhing about and\r\napparently enjoying themselves.\r\n\r\nStone tobacco pipes are made here of a kind of limestone, very curly\r\nsilver powder-flasks, rather like nautilus shells, and curious guns\r\nwithout stocks. The Bedou women wear tremendously heavy belts and very\r\nwide brass armlets. Their faces are veiled with something like the\r\n_yashmak_ of Egypt, but it is of plain blue calico, a little embroidered.\r\n\r\nMakalla is ruled over by a sultan of the Al Kaiti family, whose\r\nconnection with India has made them very English in their sympathies, and\r\nhis majesty's general appearance, with his velvet coat and jewelled\r\ndaggers, is far more Indian than Arabian. Really the most influential\r\npeople in the town are the money-grubbing Parsees from Bombay, and it is\r\nessentially one of those commercial centres where Hindustani is spoken\r\nnearly as much as Arabian. The government of the country is now almost\r\nentirely in the hands of the Al Kaiti family, which at present is the\r\nmost powerful family in the district, and is reputed to be the richest in\r\nArabia.\r\n\r\nAbout five generations ago the Seyyids of the Aboubekr family, at that\r\ntime the chief Arab family at the Hadhramout, who claimed descent from\r\nthe first of the Khalifs, were at variance with the Bedou tribes, and in\r\ntheir extremity they invited assistance from the chiefs of the Yafei\r\ntribe, who inhabit the Yafei district, to the north-east of Aden. To this\r\nrequest the Al Kaiti family responded by sending assistance to the\r\nSeyyids of the Hadhramout, putting down the troublesome Bedou tribes, and\r\nestablishing a fair amount of peace and prosperity in the country, though\r\neven to this day the Bedouin of the mountains are ever ready to swoop\r\ndown and harass the more peaceful inhabitants of the towns. At the same\r\ntime the Al Kaiti family established themselves in the Hadhramout, and\r\nfor the last four generations have been steadily adding to the power\r\nthus acquired. Makalla, Sheher, Shibahm, Haura, Hagarein, all belong to\r\nthem, and they are continually increasing, by purchase, the area of their\r\ninfluence in the collateral valleys, building substantial castles, and\r\nestablishing one of the most powerful dynasties in this much-divided\r\ncountry. They get all their money from the Straits Settlements, for it\r\nhas been the custom of the Hadhrami to leave their own sterile country to\r\nseek their fortunes abroad. The Nizam of Hyderabad has an Arab regiment\r\ncomposed entirely of Hadhrami, and the Sultan Nawasjung, the present head\r\nof the Al Kaiti family, is its general: he lives in India and governs his\r\nArabian possessions by deputy. His son Ghalib ruled in Sheher, his nephew\r\nManassar, who receives a dollar a day from England, ruled in Makalla, and\r\nhis nephew Salàh ruled in Shibahm, and the governors of the other towns\r\nare mostly connections of this family. The power and wealth of this\r\nfamily are almost the only guarantee for peace and prosperity in an\r\notherwise lawless country.\r\n\r\nThe white palace of the Sultan Manassar is six stories high, with little\r\ncarved windows and a pretty sort of cornice of open-work bricks, unbaked\r\nof course, save by the sun. It stands on a little peninsula, and like\r\nRiviera towns, has pretty coast views on either side. The sultan received\r\nus with his two young sons, dressed up in as many fine clothes as it was\r\npossible to put on, and attended by his vizier, Abdul Kalek; no business\r\nwas done as to our departure, but only compliments were paid on both\r\nsides. After we had separated presents were sent by us, loaves of sugar\r\nbeing an indispensable accompaniment.\r\n\r\nThe so-called palace in which we were lodged was next to the mosque and\r\nclose to the bazaar; the smells and noise were almost unendurable, so we\r\nworked hard to get our preparations made, and to make our sojourn here\r\nas short as possible. This 'palace' was a large building; a very dirty\r\nstaircase led to a quantity of rooms, large and small, inhabited in\r\nrather a confusing manner, not only by our own party, but by another, and\r\nto get at our servants we had to pick our way between the prostrate forms\r\nof an Arabian gentleman and his attendants. We were the first arrivals,\r\nso we collected from the various rooms as many bits of torn and rotten\r\nold matting as we could find, to keep the dust down in our own room,\r\nwhich was about 40 feet long by 30 feet wide, so very much covered with\r\ndust that no pavement could be seen without digging. It would have been\r\nnecessary to have 'seven maids with seven brooms to sweep for half a\r\nyear' before they could have cleared that room. Windows were all round,\r\nunglazed of course, and quite shutterless. We set out our furniture and\r\nhad plenty of room to spread the baggage round us. An enormous packing\r\ncase from Kew Gardens had little besides a great fork in it, so that case\r\ncame no farther. Another case, to which the botanist had to resort\r\nconstantly, had always to be tied up with rope, as it had neither lock\r\nnor hinges.\r\n\r\nWe were six days at Makalla arranging about camels and safe conduct, and\r\nwondering when we should get away; so of course we had plenty of time to\r\ninspect the town, which on account of the many Parsees had quite an\r\nIndian air in some parts. Sometimes one comes upon a deliciously scented\r\npart in the bazaars where myrrh and spices, attar of roses, and rose\r\nleaves are sold in little grimy holes almost too small to enter; but for\r\nthe part near the fish market, I can only say that awful stenches\r\nprevail, and the part where dates and other fruits are sold is almost\r\nimpassable from flies.\r\n\r\nFor our journey inland we were entrusted by the sultan to a tribe of\r\nBedouin and their camels. Mokaik was the name of our Mokadam or\r\nhead-man, and his tribe rejoiced in the name of Khailiki. They were tiny\r\nspare men, quite beardless, with very refined, gentle faces; they might\r\neasily have been taken for women, so gentle and pretty were they. They\r\nwere naturally dark, and made darker still by dirt and indigo. Their long\r\nshaggy hair was twisted up into a knot and bound by a long plaited\r\nleather string like a bootlace, which was wound round the hair and then\r\ntwo or three times round the head, like the fillet worn by Greek women in\r\nancient times. They were naked save for a loin-cloth and the girdle to\r\nwhich were attached their brass powder flasks, shaped like a ram's horn,\r\ntheir silver cases for flint and steel, their daggers, and their thorn\r\nextractors, consisting of a picker and tweezers, fastened together. They\r\nare very different from the stately Bedouin of Syria and Egypt, and are,\r\nboth as to religion and physique, distinctly an aboriginal race of\r\nSouthern Arabia, as different from the Arab as the Hindoo is from the\r\nAnglo-Saxon.\r\n\r\nOur ideas as to _Bedouin_ and _Bedawi_, which latter word we never heard\r\nwhile we were in Southern Arabia, were that they were tall, bearded men,\r\nnot very dark in colour, and our imaginations connected them with\r\nhospitality and much clothes. None of these characteristics are found\r\namong the Bedouin of this district. _Bedouin_ is not a word in use, but\r\n_Bedou_ for both singular and plural. They speak of themselves as _el\r\nBedou_, and when they have seen us wondering at some strange custom, they\r\nhave said apologetically, 'Ah! Bedou, Bedou!' I have heard them address a\r\nman whose name they did not know 'Ya Bedou.' I mean to use _Bedou_ for\r\nsingular and _Bedouin_ for plural.\r\n\r\nBesides the Bedouin we were accompanied by five soldiers,\r\nMuofok-el-Briti, Taisir-i-Fahari, Bariki, and an old man. For the\r\ntwenty-two camels we paid 175 dollars to Hagarein, a journey, we were\r\ntold, of twenty days.\r\n\r\nIt would have been useless to have had riding camels, as one could get no\r\nfaster than the baggage and soldiers, and travelling so far daily, and up\r\nsuch rocks, one had to go at foot-pace. We should have had to wait longer\r\nat Makalla while more camels were collected, and the more camels you have\r\nthe farther they stray when food is scarce, and the more chance there is\r\nof the annoyance of waiting for lost camels to be found, and sometimes\r\nfound too late to start that day. We need not have had twenty-two camels,\r\nand once, later, all the baggage was sent on ten, but this was to suit\r\nthe purposes of the Bedouin.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further with our journey, I will here say a few words\r\nconcerning the somewhat complex body politic of this portion of Arabia,\r\nthe inhabitants of which may be divided into four distinct classes.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are numerous wild tribes of Bedouin scattered all over the\r\ncountry, who do all the carrying trade, rear and own most of the camels,\r\nand possess large tracts of country, chiefly on the highlands and smaller\r\nvalleys. They are very numerous and powerful, and the Arabs of the towns\r\nare certainly afraid of them, for they can make travelling in the country\r\nvery difficult, and even blockade the towns. They never live in tents, as\r\ndo the Bedouin of Northern Arabia; the richer ones have quite large\r\nhouses, whilst the poorer ones--those in Shabwa and the Wadi Adim, for\r\ninstance--dwell in caves.\r\n\r\nSecondly, we have the Arabs proper, a decidedly later importation into\r\nthe country than the Bedouin. They live in and cultivate the lands around\r\nthe towns; many of them carry on trade and go to India and the Straits\r\nSettlements, and some of them are very wealthy. They also are divided\r\ninto tribes. The chief of those dwelling in the Hadhramout are the Yafei,\r\nKattiri, Minhali, Amri, and Tamimi. The Bedouin reside amongst them, and\r\nthey are constantly at war with one another, and the complex system of\r\ntribal union is exceedingly difficult to grasp.\r\n\r\nThirdly, we have the Seyyids and Sherifs, a sort of aristocratic\r\nhierarchy, who trace their descent from the daughter and son of the\r\nProphet. Their influence in the Hadhramout is enormous, and they fan the\r\nreligious superstition of the people, for to this they owe their\r\nexistence. They boast that their pedigree is purer than that of any other\r\nSeyyid family, even than those of Mecca and Medina. Seyyids and Sherifs\r\nare to be found in all the large towns and considerable villages, and\r\neven the Arab sultans show them a marked respect and kiss their hands\r\nwhen they enter a room. They have a distinct jurisdiction of their own,\r\nand most disputed points of property, water rights, and so on, are\r\nreferred to their decision. They look with peculiar distrust on the\r\nintroduction of external influence into their sacred country, and are the\r\nobstructionists of the Hadhramout, but at the same time their influence\r\nis decidedly towards law and order in a lawless land. They never carry\r\narms.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the slave population of the Hadhramout, all of African\r\norigin, and the freed slaves who have married and settled in the country.\r\nMost of the tillers of the soil, personal servants, and the soldiers of\r\nthe sultans are of this class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nOUR DEPARTURE INTO THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget the confusion of our start. Mokaik and ten of his\r\nmen appeared at seven in the morning of the day before in our rooms, with\r\nall the lowest beggars of Makalla in their train, and were let loose on\r\nour seventy packages like so many demons from Jehannam, yelling and\r\nquarrelling with one another. First of all the luggage had to be divided\r\ninto loads for twenty-two camels, then they drew lots for these loads\r\nwith small sticks, then they drew lots for us riders, and finally we had\r\na stormy bargain as to the price, which was finally decided upon when the\r\nvizier came to help us, and ratified by his exchanging daggers with\r\nMokaik, each dagger being presented on a flat hand. In the bazaars\r\nbargains are struck by placing the first two fingers of one contractor on\r\nthe hand of the other. All that day they were rushing in and weighing,\r\nand exhorting us to be ready betimes in the morning, so we were quite\r\nready about sunrise.\r\n\r\nWe felt worn and weary when a start was made at two o'clock, and our cup\r\nof bitterness was full when we were deposited, bag and baggage, a few\r\nhundred yards from the gate, and told that we must spend the night amidst\r\na sea of small fish drying on the shore, and surrounded on all sides by\r\ndirty Bedou huts. These fish, which are rather larger than sardines, are\r\nput out to dry by thousands along this coast. Men feed on them and so do\r\nthe camels; they make lamp-oil out of them; they say the fish\r\nstrengthens the camel's back, and they consider it good for camels to go\r\nonce a year to the sea. Large sacks of them are taken into the interior\r\nas merchandise; they are mixed with small leaves like box, and carried in\r\npalm-leaf sacks, about 3 feet wide and 1½ feet high, and the air\r\neverywhere is redolent of their stench.\r\n\r\nAt this point we had the first of many quarrels with our camel-men; we\r\ninsisted on being taken two miles farther on, away from the smells;\r\nnothing short of threats of returning and getting the sultan to beat them\r\nand put them in prison enabled us to break through the conventional Arab\r\ncustom of encamping for the first night outside the city gates. However,\r\nwe succeeded in reaching Bakhrein, where white wells are placed for the\r\nbenefit of wayfarers, and there beneath the pleasant shade of the\r\npalm-trees we halted for the remainder of the day and recovered from the\r\nagonies of our start. Among the trees was a bungalow belonging to the\r\nsultan where we had hoped to have been able to sleep, but it was pervaded\r\nby such a strong smell of fish that we preferred to pitch our tents.\r\n\r\nBetween this place and Makalla all is arid waste, but near the town, by\r\nthe help of irrigation, bananas and cocoanut trees flourish in a shallow\r\nvalley called 'the Beginning of Light.' There are numerous fortresses\r\nabout Bakhrein, so the road is now quite safe for the inhabitants of\r\nMakalla; the sultan has done a good deal to repress the Bedouin who used\r\nto raid right into the town. He crucified many of them.\r\n\r\nWe took a couple of hours over our start next day, the Bedouin again\r\nquarrelling over the luggage, each trying to scramble for the lightest\r\npackages and the lightest riders. They tried to make me ride a camel and\r\ngive up my horse to my husband. As he was so tall, he could obtain\r\nneither a horse nor a donkey, so had perforce to ride a camel.\r\n\r\nHe had been able to buy a little dark donkey for Imam Sharif and the\r\nsultan gave me a horse, but all the rest were on camels. I thought I\r\nshould enjoy riding by the camels and talking to everyone, but my hopes\r\nwere not carried out.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of passing the strings of camels was enormous. The country\r\nwas so very stony that if you left the narrow path it took a long time to\r\npick your way.\r\n\r\nI used to start first with Imam Sharif, and then my horse, at foot-pace,\r\ngot so far ahead that the soldiers said, 'We cannot guard both you and\r\nthe camels.' I had then to pull in the horse with all my might. Sometimes\r\nI went on with Imam Sharif, one soldier and a servant carrying the\r\nplane-table. He used to go up some hill to survey, and I, of course, had\r\nto climb too for safety. I had to rush down when I saw our _kafila_\r\ncoming and mount, to keep in front. If I got behind, the camels were so\r\nterrified that they danced about and shed their loads, and I was cursed\r\nand sworn at by their drivers.\r\n\r\nWe stopped three hours at Basra (10 miles), where there are a few houses,\r\nwater, and some cultivation, and where the camels were suddenly unloaded\r\nwithout leave, and there was a great row because we moved the soldiers'\r\nguns from the tree, the shade of which we wished to have ourselves. We\r\nagain threatened to return, but at last, as Taisir fortunately could\r\nspeak Hindustani, he could make peace, and they ended by kissing hands\r\nand saying salaam (peace).\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting when we reached a sandy place called Tokhum (another\r\n5 miles on), where we camped near some stagnant water. We had to wait for\r\nthe moon, to find our baggage and get out the lantern. We had travelled\r\nover almost leafless plains save that they had little patches of\r\nmesembryanthemum, and the inevitable balloon-shrub (_madhar_). Rising and\r\nstarting by moonlight on Christmas morning, we stopped in Wadi Ghafit\r\n(_madhar_), a very pretty side valley, with warm water and palm-trees,\r\nand what looked like a grassy sward near the water, but which really\r\nconsisted of a tiny kind of palm. The camel-men wanted to pass this place\r\nand camp far away on the stones, sending skins for water, but somehow my\r\nhusband found this out after we had passed Wadi Ghafit, and managed to\r\ncarry off the camels, tied tail after tail to his own camel, so the\r\nBedouin had to follow unwillingly. We gave them some presents, saying it\r\nwas not an everyday occurrence, but that this was a great feast with us;\r\nso we made friends.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin were very unruly about the packing. We could not get our most\r\nneedful things kept handy, and they liked to pack our bread with their\r\nfish, and the waterskins anywhere among our bedding.\r\n\r\nMokaik did not seem to have much authority over the various owners of the\r\ncamels, and they were always quarrelling among themselves, robbing each\r\nother of light loads and leaving some heavy thing, that no one wished\r\nfor, lying on the ground; this often occasioned re-packing. They had for\r\neach camel a stout pair of sticks with strong ropes attached, and having\r\nbound a bundle of packages to each stick, two men lifted them and wound\r\nthe ropes round the sticks over a very tiny pack-saddle and a mass of\r\nuntidy rags. When we arrived they liked to simply loose the ropes from\r\nthe sticks and let the baggage clatter to the ground and lead away the\r\ncamels. As they would not be persuaded to sort the things, and as\r\ntwenty-two camels cover a good deal of space, it was like seeking the\r\nslain on a battlefield when we had to wander about having every bundle\r\nuntied.\r\n\r\nThree days' camel-riding up one of the short valleys which lead towards\r\nthe high table-land offered little of interest beyond arid, igneous\r\nrocks, and burnt-up, sand-covered valleys, with distorted strata on\r\neither side. Here and there, where warm volcanic streams rise out of the\r\nground, the wilderness is converted into a luxuriant garden, in which\r\npalms, tobacco, and other green things grow. One of the scrub trees which\r\nclothe the wilderness is called by the Arabs _rack_, and is used by them\r\nfor cleaning their teeth. It amused us to chew this as we went along: it\r\nis slightly bitter, but cleans the teeth most effectually.\r\n\r\nThere is also a poisonous sort of cucumber, called by the Arabs\r\n_madakdak_. They clean out the inside and fill the skin with water, which\r\nthey drink as a medicine. At Sibeh, which we reached after a very hot\r\nride of twelve or thirteen miles, we found water with scores of camels\r\nlying round it, for there were two or three other _kafilas_, or caravans,\r\nbeside our own. It was dreadfully cold that night, and we could not get\r\nat our bag of blankets.\r\n\r\nNext we entered the narrow, tortuous valley of Howeri, which ascends\r\ntowards the highland, in which the midday heat was intense; and at our\r\nevening halts we suffered not a little from camel-ticks, which abound in\r\nthe sand, until we learnt to avoid old camping-grounds and not to pitch\r\nour tents in the immediate vicinity of the wells.\r\n\r\nWe encamped in a narrow, stony river-bed, between walls of rock, near a\r\nlittle village called Tahiya. There is a good deal of cultivation about.\r\nThe closeness of the situation made the smell of the dried fish we\r\ncarried for the camels almost unbearable.\r\n\r\nThese sacks are stretched open in the evening and put in the middle of a\r\ncircle of camels, their masters often joining in the feast. One of the\r\nmen was attacked by fever, so he was given quinine, and his friends were\r\ntold to put him to bed and cover him well. When we went to visit him\r\nlater we found him quite contented in one of these fish sacks, his head\r\nin one corner and his legs all doubled up and packed in; only a bare\r\nbrown back was exposed, so we had a few of the camel's rags thrown on\r\nhis back, and he was well next day.\r\n\r\nWe went on ten miles to Al Ghail, rising to an altitude of 2,000 feet\r\nabove the sea-level. This word _ghail_ begins with the Arabic _ghin_,\r\nwhich is a soft sound between _r_ and _g_.\r\n\r\nThere are two villages near the head of the Wadi Howeri, where there is\r\nactually a _ghail_--that rare phenomenon in Arabia, a rill or running\r\nstream. Here the Bedou inhabitants cultivate the date palm, and have\r\ngreen patches of lucerne and grain, very refreshing to the eye.\r\n\r\nWe had come up one of the narrowest of gorges, but with hundreds of\r\npalm-trees around Al Ghail, the first of the two villages, which is in\r\nthe end of the Wadi Howeri. It is an uninteresting collection of stone\r\nhuts, with many pretty little fields, and maidenhair fern overhanging the\r\nwayside. There are little enclosures with walls round them, and small\r\nstones in them, on which they dry the dates before sending them to Aden.\r\nThe rocky river-bed itself is waterless, the _ghail_ being used up in\r\nirrigation.\r\n\r\nAt Al Bat'ha, which is just above the tableland, we actually encamped\r\nunder a spreading tree, a wild, unedible fig called _luthba_ by the\r\nArabs, a nickname given to all worthless, idle individuals in these\r\nparts. Bedou women crowded around us, closely veiled in indigo-dyed\r\nmasks, with narrow slits for their eyes, carrying their babies with them\r\nin rude cradles resembling hencoops, with a cluster of charms hung from\r\nthe top, which has the twofold advantage of amusing the baby and keeping\r\noff the evil eye. After much persuasion we induced one of the good ladies\r\nto sit for her photograph, or rather to sit still while something was\r\nbeing done which she did not in the least understand.\r\n\r\nThere is very good water at Al Bat'ha, and so much of the kind of herbs\r\nthat camels like that we delayed our departure till eight, shivering by\r\na fire and longing as ardently for the arrival of the sun as we should\r\nfor his departure. The road had been so steep and stony that the\r\ncamel-riders had all been on foot for two days. I am sure that, except\r\nnear a spring, no one dropped from the skies would dream he was in Arabia\r\nthe Happy. It is hard to think that 'the Stony' and 'the Desert' must be\r\nworse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE AKABA\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving left these villages behind us, we climbed rapidly higher and\r\nhigher, until at an elevation of over 4,000 feet we found ourselves at\r\nlast on a broad, level table-land, stretching as far as the eye could\r\nreach in every direction. This is no doubt the 'Maratha Mountains' of\r\nPtolemy, the Mons Excelsus of Pliny,[8] which shuts off the Hadhramout,\r\nwhere once flourished the frankincense and the myrrh.\r\n\r\nWords cannot express the desolate aspect of this vast table-land, Akaba\r\nor the 'going-up,' as the Arabs call it. It is perfectly level, and\r\nstrewn with black lumps of basalt, looking as though a gigantic\r\ncoal-scuttle had been upset. Occasionally there rises up above the plain\r\na flat-topped mound or ridge, some 80 feet high, the last remnant of a\r\nhigher level which is now disappearing. There is no sign of habitation.\r\nOnly here and there are a few tanks, dug to collect the rain-water, if\r\nany falls. These are protected or indicated by a pair of walls built\r\nopposite one another, and banked up on the outer side with earth and\r\nstones, like shooting butts. The Akaba is exclusively Bedou property, and\r\nwherever a little herbage is to be found, there the nomads drive their\r\nflocks and young camels.\r\n\r\nOf the frankincense which once flourished over all this vast area, we saw\r\nonly one specimen on the highland itself, though it is still found in the\r\nmore sheltered gullies; and farther east, in the Mahri country, there is,\r\nI understand, a considerable quantity left. We were often given lumps of\r\ngum arabic, and myrrh is still found plentifully; it is tapped for its\r\nodoriferous sap. It is a curious fact that the Somali come from Africa to\r\ncollect it, going from tribe to tribe of the Bedouin, and buying the\r\nright to collect these two species, sometimes paying as much as fifty\r\ndollars. They go round and cut the trees, and after eight days return to\r\ncollect the exuded sap.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times none but slaves collected frankincense and myrrh. This\r\nfact, taken probably with the meaning of the name Hadhramout (the later\r\nform of the ancient name Hazarmaveth), gave rise to the quaint Greek\r\nlegend 'that the fumes of the frankincense-trees were deadly, and the\r\nplace where they grew was called the valley or enclosure of death.'\r\n\r\nFrom personal observation it would appear that the ancients held\r\ncommunication with the Hadhramout almost entirely by the land\r\ncaravan-route, as there is absolutely no trace of great antiquity to be\r\nfound along the coast-line, whereas the Wadi Hadhramout itself and its\r\ncollateral branches are very rich in remains of the ancient Himyaritic\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nThough we were always looking about for monuments of antiquity, the most\r\nancient and lasting memorial of far past ages lay beneath our feet in\r\nthat little narrow path winding over Akaba and Wadi, and polished by the\r\nsoft feet of millions of camels that had slowly passed over it for\r\nthousands and thousands of years.\r\n\r\nWe found the air of the table-land fresh and invigorating after the\r\nexcessive heat of the valleys below. For three days we travelled\r\nnorthwards across the plateau. Our first stage was Haibel Gabrein. This\r\nis, as it were, the culminating point of the whole district; it is 4,150\r\nfeet above the sea. From it the table-land slopes gently down to the\r\nnorthward towards the main valley of the Hadhramout, and eastwards\r\ntowards the Wadi Adim. After two days more travelling we approached the\r\nheads of the many valleys which run into the Hadhramout; the Wadis Doan,\r\nRakhi, Al Aisa, Al Ain, Bin Ali, and Adim all start from this elevated\r\nplateau and run nearly parallel. The curious feature of most of these\r\nvalleys is the rapid descent into them; they look as if they had been\r\ntaken out of the high plateau like slices out of a cake. They do not\r\nappear to have been formed by a fall of water from this plateau; in fact,\r\nit is impossible that a sufficient force of water could ever have existed\r\non this flat surface to form this elaborate valley system. In the valleys\r\nthemselves there is very little slope, for we found that, with the\r\nexception of the Wadi Adim, all the valley heads we visited were nearly\r\nof uniform height with the main valley, and had a wall of rock\r\napproaching 1,000 feet in height, eaten away as it were out of the\r\nplateau. We were, therefore, led to suppose that these valleys had\r\noriginally been formed by the action of the sea, and that the Hadhramout\r\nhad once been a large bay or arm of the sea, which, as the waters of the\r\nocean receded, leaving successive marks of many strands on the limestone\r\nand sandstone rocks which enclosed them, formed an outlet for the scanty\r\nwater-supply of the Southern Arabian highlands. These valleys have, in\r\nthe course of ages, been silted up by sand to a considerable height,\r\nbelow which water is always found, and the only means of obtaining water\r\nin the Hadhramout for drinking purposes, as well as for cultivation, is\r\nby sinking wells. The water of the main valley is strongly impregnated\r\nwith salt, but is much sweeter at the sides of the valley than in the\r\ncentre. No doubt this is caused by the weight of the alkaline deposits\r\nwashed down from the salt hills at Shabwa, at the head of the main\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nThe steep, reddish sandstone cliffs which form the walls of these valleys\r\nare themselves almost always divided into three distinct stories or\r\nstratifications, which can be distinctly seen on the photographs. The\r\nupper one is very abrupt, the second slightly projecting and more broken,\r\nand the third formed by deposit from above. The descent into the valley\r\nis extremely difficult at all points. Paths down which camels can just\r\nmake their way have been constructed by the Bedouin, by making use of the\r\nstratified formation and the gentler slopes; but only in the case of the\r\nWadi Adim, of all the valleys we visited, is there anything approaching a\r\ngradual descent.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me highly probable that the systematic destruction of the\r\nfrankincense and myrrh trees through countless generations has done much\r\nto alter the character of this Akaba, and has contributed to the gradual\r\nsilting up of the Hadhramout and its collateral valleys, to which fact I\r\nshall again have occasion to refer. The aspect of this plateau forcibly\r\nrecalled to our minds that portion of Abyssinia which we visited in\r\n1892-93; there is the same arid coast-line between the sea and the\r\nmountains, and the same rapid ascent to a similar absolutely level\r\nplateau, and the same draining northwards to a large river-bed in the\r\ncase of Abyssinia, into the valleys of the Mareb and other tributaries of\r\nthe Nile, and in the case of this Arabian plateau into the Hadhramout.\r\nOnly Abyssinia has a more copious rainfall, which makes its plateau more\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nIt had not been our intention to visit the Wadi Al Aisa, but to approach\r\nthe Hadhramout by another valley called Doan, parallel and further west,\r\nbut our camel-men would not take us that way, and purposely got up a\r\nscare that the men of Khoreba at the head of Wadi Doan were going to\r\nattack us, and would refuse to let us pass. A convenient old woman was\r\nfound who professed to bring this news, a dodge subsequently resorted to\r\nby another Bedou tribe which wanted to govern our progress.\r\n\r\nThe report brought to us, as from the old woman, was to this effect: A\r\nlarge body of sheikhs and seyyids having started from Khoreba[9] to meet\r\nand repel us, Mokaik's father had left home to help us. As we had now\r\nabandoned Khoreba, Mokaik said he was anxious to hurry off to meet his\r\nfather and prevent a hostile collision. Mokaik was told _he_ could not go\r\nas he was responsible for our safety, but that some others might go.\r\n'No,' said Mokaik, 'they cannot be spared from the camels; we will get\r\ntwo men from the village.' My husband agreed to this, but when Mokaik\r\nproposed that my husband should at once pay these men, he told Mokaik\r\nthat he must pay them himself, as he was paid to protect us. This attempt\r\nat extortion having failed, we passed a peaceful night and subsequently\r\nfound Mokaik's father, Suleiman Bakran, safe at home, which he had never\r\nthought of leaving.\r\n\r\nOur first peep down into the Wadi Al Aisa, towards which our Bedouin had\r\nconducted us, was striking in the extreme, and as we gazed down into the\r\nnarrow valley, with its line of vegetation and its numerous villages, we\r\nfelt as if we were on the edge of another world.\r\n\r\nThe descent from the table-land to the Wadi is exactly 1,500 feet by a\r\ndifficult, but very skilfully engineered footpath. The sun's rays,\r\nreflected from the limestone cliffs, were scorchingly hot. The camels\r\nwent a longer way round, nearer the head of the valley, but, so difficult\r\nwas our short cut that they arrived before us, and the horse, and the\r\ndonkey.\r\n\r\nHaving humbly descended into the Wadi Al Aisa, because we were not\r\nallowed to go by the Wadi Doan, we found ourselves encamped hard by the\r\nvillage of Khaila, the head-quarters of the Khailiki tribe, within a\r\nstone's throw of Mokaik's father's house and under the shadow of the\r\ncastle of his uncle, the sheikh of the tribe. These worthies both\r\nextorted from us substantial sums of money and sold us food at exorbitant\r\nprices, and so we soon learnt why we were not permitted to go to Khoreba,\r\nand why the old woman and her story had been produced.\r\n\r\nWe thought Mokaik and his men little better than naked savages when on\r\nthe plateau, but when we were introduced to their relatives, and when we\r\nsaw their castles and their palm groves and their long line of gardens in\r\nthe narrow valley, our preconceived notions of the wild homeless Bedou\r\nand his poverty underwent considerable change.\r\n\r\nWe climbed up the side of the valley opposite Khaila to photograph a\r\ncastle adorned with horns, but were driven away; too late, for the\r\npicture had been taken.\r\n\r\nDuring the two days we encamped at Khaila we were gazed upon\r\nuninterruptedly by a relentless crowd of men, women, and children. It\r\namused us at first to see the women, here for the most part unmasked,\r\nwith their exceedingly heavy girdles of brass, their anklets of brass\r\nhalf a foot deep, their bracelets of brass, their iron nose rings, and\r\ntheir massive and numerous earrings which tore down the lobe of the ear\r\nwith their weight. Every Bedou, male or female, has a ring or charm of\r\ncornelian set in base silver, and agates and small tusks also set in\r\nsilver.\r\n\r\nThe root with which the women paint themselves yellow is called _shubab_.\r\nIt is dried and powdered. It only grows when there is rain. The whole of\r\nthe poultry at Khaila was carried about in the arms of the women and\r\nchildren who owned them, all the time of our sojourn, in the hopes of\r\nselling them. They, at least, were glad of our departure.\r\n\r\nNot far from Khaila, we saw a fine village which we were told was\r\ninhabited by Arabs of pure blood, so we sent a polite message to the\r\nseyyid, or head-man of the place, to ask if we might pay him our\r\nrespects. His reply was to the effect that if we paid thirty dollars we\r\nmight come and pass four hours in the town. Needless to say we declined\r\nthe invitation with thanks, and on the morrow when we marched down the\r\nWadi Al Aisa we gave the abode of this hospitable seyyid a wide berth,\r\nparticularly as the soldiers told us it was not safe, for the Arabs meant\r\nto kill us.\r\n\r\nLeaving Khaila, where we remained two nights and saw the New Year in, we\r\npassed a good many towered villages: Larsmeh was one, Hadouf another,\r\nalso Subak and others. We passed the mouth of the Wadi Doan, which runs\r\nparallel to Wadi Al Aisa, and has two branches, only the largest having\r\nthe name Doan. The mouth is about three miles below Khaila; five miles\r\nmore brought us to Sief, where we halted for a night. It is also\r\ninhabited by pure Arabs, who treated us with excessive rudeness. It is a\r\nvery picturesque spot, perched on a rock, with towers and turrets\r\nconstructed of sun-dried brick; only here, as elsewhere in these valleys,\r\nthe houses being so exactly the same colour as the rocks behind them,\r\nthey lose their effect. The rich have evidently recognised this\r\ndifficulty and whitewash their houses, but in the poorer villages there\r\nis no whitewash, and consequently nothing to make them stand out from\r\ntheir surroundings.\r\n\r\nOne can pretty well judge of the wealth of the owners of the various\r\ntowers and castles by the amount of whitewash. Some have only the\r\npinnacles white, and some can afford to trim up the windows and put bands\r\nround the building.\r\n\r\nAt Sief several men came once or twice and begged my husband to let me go\r\nout that the women might see me, but when I went out they would not allow\r\nme to approach or hold any intercourse with the Arab women, using\r\nopprobrious epithets when I tried to make friendly overtures, with the\r\nquaint result that whenever I advanced towards a group of gazing females\r\nthey fled precipitately like a flock of sheep before a collie dog, so we\r\ndiscovered that it was the men themselves who wished to see me. These\r\nwomen wear their dresses high in front (showing their yellow-painted legs\r\nabove the knee) and long behind; they are of deep blue cotton, decorated\r\nwith fine embroidery, and patches of yellow and red sewn on in patterns.\r\nIt is the universal female dress in the Hadhramout, and looks as if the\r\nfashion had not changed since the days when Hazarmaveth the Patriarch\r\nsettled in this valley and gave it his name.[10] The tall tapering straw\r\nhat worn by these women when in the fields contributes with the mask to\r\nmake the Hadhrami females as externally repulsive as the most jealous of\r\nhusbands could desire.\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure that this must be the very same dress which made such an\r\nunfavourable impression upon Sir John Maundeville, when he saw 'the foul\r\nwomen who live near Babylon the great.' He says: 'They are vilely\r\narrayed. They go barefoot and clothed in evil garments, large and wide,\r\nbut short to the knees, long sleeves down to the feet like a monk's\r\nfrock, and their sleeves are hanging about their shoulders.'\r\n\r\nThe dress is certainly wide, for the two pieces of which it is composed,\r\nexactly like the Greek peplos, when the arms are extended, stretch from\r\nfinger-tip to finger-tip, so when this dress is caught into the loose\r\ngirdle far below the waist, it hangs out under the arms and gives a very\r\nround-backed look, as is the case with the peplos.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many Arabs at Sief, a most unhealthy, diseased-looking\r\nlot. They are of the yellow kind of Arab, with Jewish-looking faces.\r\n\r\nSaleh retired into Sief on our arrival, and we saw him no more till we\r\nstarted next day. He was a very useless interpreter. He used to like to\r\nlive in the villages, saying he could not bear to live in the camp of\r\nsuch unbelievers as we were, and used to bring his friends to our kitchen\r\nand show them some little tins of Lazenby's potted meat, adorned with a\r\npicture of a sheep, a cow, and a pig, as a proof that we lived on pork,\r\nwhereas we had none with us. He always tried to persuade the people that\r\nhe was far superior to any of us, and when places had to be made amongst\r\nthe baggage on the camels for my husband and the servants to ride, he\r\nused to have his camel prepared and ride on, leaving some of the servants\r\nwith no seat kept on the camels for them. My husband cured him of this,\r\nfor one morning, seeing Saleh's bedding nicely arranged, he jumped on to\r\nthe camel himself and rode off, leaving Saleh an object of great\r\nderision.\r\n\r\nOnce we got down into the valley we had to ride very close together for\r\nsafety, and I found it most tiresome making my horse, Basha, keep pace\r\nwith the camels.\r\n\r\nThe people at Sief were so disagreeable that I told Saleh to remind them\r\nthat, if our Queen wanted their country, she would have had it long\r\nbefore we were born, and that they were very foolish to fear so small an\r\nunarmed party, who had only come to pass the winter in a country warmer\r\nthan their own; at the same time, unless we had been quite confident that\r\nour safety was well secured from behind, such a party, with a woman among\r\nthem, would never have come.\r\n\r\nWe set off early next morning for Hagarein. We passed after one hour\r\nKaidoun, with its own private little valley to the west, a tributary of\r\nthe main one, which in this part is called Wadi Kasr. There is the grave\r\nof a celebrated saint, and a very pious seyyid, called Al Habid Taha Ali\r\nal Hadad, abides near it. He never goes out of his house, but is so much\r\nrevered that many thousands of dollars are sent him from India and other\r\nparts, and when his son visited Aden he was received with great honour by\r\nthe merchants there. Then we passed several other villages, including\r\nAllahaddi and Namerr. It was at the _ziaret_ or pilgrimage to the grave\r\nin Kaidoun that Herr von Wrede, who was disguised, was discovered to be a\r\nChristian and forced to turn back.\r\n\r\nThe town of Hagarein or Hajarein is the principal one in the collateral\r\nvalleys, and is built on a lofty isolated rock in the middle of the Wadi\r\nKasr, about twenty miles before it joins the main valley of the\r\nHadhramout. With its towers and turrets it recalled to our minds as we\r\nsaw it in the distance certain hill-set, mediæval villages of Germany and\r\nItaly. Here a vice-sultan governs on behalf of the Al Kaiti family, an\r\nill-conditioned, extortionate individual, whose bad reception of us\r\ncontributed to his subsequent removal from office. Internally Hagarein is\r\nsqualid and dirty in the extreme; each street is but a cesspool for the\r\nhouses on either side of it, and the house allotted to us produced\r\nspecimens of most smells and most insects. The days of rest we proposed\r\nfor ourselves here were spent in fighting with our old camel-men who left\r\nus here, in fighting with the new ones who were to take us on to the main\r\nvalley, and in indignantly refusing to pay the sultan the sum of money\r\nwhich our presence in his town led him to think it his right to demand.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Pliny, xii. 14, 52: 'In medio Arabiae fere sunt Adramitae\r\npagus Saboraeum in monte excelso.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The town of Khoreba, in the Wadi Doan, may represent the\r\ntown of Doan itself mentioned by Hamdani, the Thabanê of Ptolemy, which\r\nPliny calls Toani. The name Khoreba signifies ruins.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Gen. x. 26.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHROUGH WADI KASR\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the foot of the hill on which Hagarein stands we\r\ndismounted; there was tremendous work to get out the sword of the oldest\r\nsoldier; he had used it so much as a walking-stick that it was firmly\r\nfixed in the scabbard. The scabbards are generally covered with white\r\ncalico. A very steep, winding, slippery road led us to the gate, where\r\nsoldiers received us and conducted us to a courtyard, letting off guns\r\nthe while. There stood the Sultan Abdul M'Barrek Hamout al Kaiti, a very\r\nfat, evil-looking man, pitted by smallpox. After shaking hands he led us\r\ndown the tortuous streets to his palace, and then took us up a narrow mud\r\nstaircase, so dark that we did not know whether to turn to the right or\r\nleft; we sometimes went one way and sometimes the other. At length we\r\nreached a small room with some goat-hair carpets and we and the sultan,\r\nthe soldiers (his and ours), the Bedouin and my groom, M'barrek, all\r\nseated ourselves round the wall, and after a long time a dirty glass of\r\nwater was handed round as our only entertainment. As we had had nothing\r\nto eat since sunrise, and it was about two o'clock, we did not feel\r\ncheerful when the sultan abruptly rose and said he must pray. Praying and\r\nsleeping are always the excuses when they want to get rid of guests or\r\nsay 'not at home,' and indeed the sleeping excuse prevails in Greece\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nSome time after, our four chairs were brought, so we sat till near four\r\no'clock homeless, and getting hungrier and hungrier, when the sultan\r\nreappeared, telling my husband all our things were locked up in a\r\ncourtyard and giving him a great wooden key. We hastened to our home, up\r\na long dark stair, past many floors, all used as stalls and stables, &c.,\r\nonly the two top floors being devoted to human habitation. Each floor\r\nconsisted of one fair-sized room and one very tiny den, a kitchen. The\r\nwhole Indian party had the lower room, and three of our soldiers the den.\r\nI cannot think how they could all lie down at once, and they had to cook\r\nthere besides. Above that, we had the best room, the botanist and\r\nnaturalist the den, and Matthaios made his abode on the roof, where he\r\ncooked. The Bedouin, having unloaded the camels in the courtyard across\r\nthe street, refused to help us, and, as no one else could be got, my\r\nhusband and all his merry men had to carry up the baggage, while I\r\nwrestled with the beds and other furniture in our earthy room. The\r\ninstant the baggage was up the Bedouin clamoured for payment, and it was\r\ntrying work opening the various packages where the bags of money were\r\nscattered, and to begin quarrelling when we were so weary and hungry. We\r\nhad been told that our journey to Hagarein would take twenty days,\r\nwhereas it only took thirteen, and that we must take two camels for\r\nwater, which had proved unnecessary; besides the camels had been much\r\nloaded with fish and other goods belonging to the Bedouin. My husband\r\nsaid he would pay for the twenty days and they would thus have thirty\r\ndollars as _bakshish_. But, in the end, the soldiers from Makalla said we\r\nmust pay _bakshish_: it would be an insult to their sultan if we did not\r\nand they would go no further with us. The local sultan also insisting,\r\nfourteen more dollars had to be produced. Our own soldiers soon came\r\nshouting and saying they must have half a rupee a day for food, which my\r\nhusband thought it wise to give, though the _wazir_ at Makalla had said\r\nhe was to give nothing.\r\n\r\nThey were hardly gone when the sultan came back personally conducting two\r\nkids and saying we need think of no further expense; we were his guests\r\nand were to ask for what we wished. All my husband asked for was daily\r\nmilk. We got some that day, but never again. My groom, M'barrek, then\r\ncame, saying he must have food money; that being settled, he returned\r\nsaying the sultan said he must have half a rupee a day for my horse,\r\nwhich became very thin on the starvation he got.\r\n\r\nAll this time we could get no water, so not till dark could Matthaios\r\nfurnish us with tea, cold meat, bread, and honey.\r\n\r\nWe were fortunate in having plenty of bread. We had six big sacks of\r\nlarge cakes of plain bread dried hard, and of this we had learnt the\r\nvalue by experience. We kept it sheltered, if there was any fear of rain,\r\nas in Abyssinia, for instance, and before a meal soaked it in water,\r\nwrapped it in a napkin a few minutes, and then dried it up to the\r\nconsistency of fresh bread. We were often obliged to give it to the\r\nhorses, for the difficulty as to forage makes them unfit to travel in\r\nsuch barren places.\r\n\r\nWe also took charcoal and found that, with it and the bread, we had our\r\nmeals long before the Indian party, who had a weary search for fuel\r\nbefore they could even begin with 'pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker's man.'\r\nThe making of _chupatties_ also causes delay in starting. As to the honey\r\nit is most plentiful and tastes like orange flowers, but really it is the\r\ndate-flower which imparts this flavour. It is much more glutinous than\r\nours. It is packed, for exportation and to bring as tribute, in large\r\nround tin boxes, stopped up round the edges with mud. It is used in\r\npaying both taxes and tribute.\r\n\r\nWe were quite worn out with this day. The sultan received a present next\r\nmorning of silk for a robe, a turban, some handkerchiefs, two watches,\r\nsome knives, scissors, needle-cases, and other things, but he afterwards\r\nsent Saleh to say he did not like his present at all and wanted dollars.\r\nHe got ten rupees and was satisfied.\r\n\r\nWe again visited him with our servants and soldiers and were given tea\r\nwhile we talked over the future, and all seemed fair. Later the sultan\r\ncame to visit us and talk about the escort. He said we must take five\r\nsoldiers, bargained for their wages, food, and bakshish, and obtained the\r\nmoney. My husband inquired about some ruins near Meshed, three hours by\r\ncamel from Hagarein, and said that if the sultan would arrange that we\r\nshould dig safely, he should have forty dollars, and he settled to go\r\nwith my husband next day to see the place. Accordingly next day the\r\nsultan came with eight soldiers, singing and dancing all the way, and\r\nsome men of the Nahad tribe as _siyara_, as we were then in their land.\r\n\r\nThe sultan showed us two letters in which it was said that we were to\r\nhave been attacked between Sief and Kaidoun, and we remembered having\r\nseen a man on a camel apparently watching for us, but instead of coming\r\nforward he galloped away; and thus it appears we got past the place from\r\nwhich they meant to set upon us, before the attacking party could arrive.\r\n\r\nDuring the days we were at Hagarein several weddings were celebrated. To\r\nform a suitable place for conviviality they cover over a yard with mats,\r\njust as the Abyssinians do, and the women, to show their hilarity on the\r\noccasion, utter the same gurgling noises as the Abyssinian women do on a\r\nlike occasion, and which in Abyssinia is called _ulultà_. From our roof\r\nwe watched the bridegroom's nocturnal procession to his bride's house,\r\naccompanied by his friends bearing torches, and singing and speechifying\r\nto their hearts' content.\r\n\r\nOn our return from the ruins near Meshed, Taisir (our soldier) came to us\r\nand was very indignant about the price the sultan charged for his\r\nsoldiers. He was given ten rupees to attach himself to us, as an earnest\r\nof the good bakshish he would get at the coast, as he said all the other\r\nsoldiers would go back from Shibahm, and really in that case I think he\r\nwould have been glad of our escort.\r\n\r\nThen Saleh, who had 100 rupees a month and ate with everyone, came to\r\ndemand half a rupee a day for food; this was granted, as we thought it\r\ncould come off his bakshish, and he soon appeared to make the same\r\nrequest for Mahmoud, the naturalist. Matthaios was furious, as Mahmoud\r\nate partly with him, and no one was angrier with him than Saleh. It was\r\nsettled that we should give him tea, bread, and four annas, and they all\r\nwent off bawling. Afterwards we heard Saleh had said, 'Mr. Bent is giving\r\nso much money to the sultan, why should we not have some?'\r\n\r\nWe really thought at first that we should be able to encamp at Meshed and\r\ndig, for there was a seyyid who had been in Hyderabad and was very civil\r\nto us, but this happiness only lasted one hour. The sultan said it would\r\nreally not be safe unless we lived in Hagarein, so we had to give it up\r\nas it was an impossibility to dig in the heat of the day, with six hours'\r\njourney to fatigue us; besides we must have paid many soldiers and we\r\nwere told no one would dig for us. So much was said about the dangers of\r\nthe onward road that Saleh was sent with the letters for Shibahm and\r\nSheher and told to hold them tight, and say that if we could not deliver\r\nthese in person we should return to the wali of Aden and say that the\r\nsultan of Hagarein would not let us go on. This frightened him, so he\r\nmade a very dear bargain for fifteen camels, and we were to leave next\r\nday.\r\n\r\nWe were glad enough to depart from Hagarein, which is so picturesque that\r\nit really might be an old, mediæval, fortified town on the Rhine, built\r\nentirely of mud and with no water in its river. All the houses are\r\nenormously high, and have a kitchen and oven on each floor. The bricks of\r\nwhich they are built are about one foot square and with straw in them.\r\nThey have shooting holes from every room and machicolations over the\r\nouter doors and along the battlements, and what makes the houses seem to\r\ncontain even more stories than they do, is that each floor has two ranges\r\nof windows, one on the ground so that you can only see out if you sit on\r\nthe floor, and another too high to see out of at all; below every lower\r\nwindow projects a long wooden spout. The narrow lanes are mere drains,\r\nand the whole place a hotbed of disease; the people looked very\r\nunhealthy: when cholera comes they die like flies. As a wind up to this\r\nlast evening Mahmoud came into our room and soon began to say his\r\nprayers; we could not make out why, but it turned out he had no light in\r\nhis room.\r\n\r\nAltogether we had not a reposeful time in Hagarein. We were told early\r\nnext day that fourteen men of the Nahad tribe had come as our _siyara_,\r\nthough we had been told two would be sufficient; so we had to agree to\r\ntake four. Then we were asked to pay those who had come unbidden. The\r\nsultan came himself about it, and his children came to beg for annas. At\r\nlast the sultan, who had often said he felt as if he were our brother,\r\nobtained twelve rupees which he asked for to pay his expenses for the\r\nkids and honey, and said my horse had eaten the worth of twice as much\r\nmoney as he had asked before.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally got off we found the old rascal had only sent half the\r\nNahadi and had only sent two soldiers, and so had really made forty\r\ndollars out of us over that one item. The Nahad men had ten dollars\r\neach. They are not under the sultan of Makalla, but independent. The\r\nNahad tribe occupy about ten miles of the valley through which we passed,\r\nand the toll-money we paid to this tribe for the privilege of passing by\r\nwas the most exorbitant demanded from us on our journey. When once you\r\nhave paid the toll-money (_siyar_), and have with you the escort\r\n(_siyara_) of the tribe in whose territory you are, you are practically\r\nsafe wherever you may travel in Arabia, but this did not prevent us from\r\nbeing grossly insulted as we passed by certain Nahad villages. Kaidoun,\r\nwhere dwells the very holy man so celebrated all the country round for\r\nhis miracles and good works, is the chief centre of this tribe. We had\r\npurposely avoided passing too near this town, and afterwards learnt that\r\nit was owing to the influence of this very holy seyyid that our reception\r\nwas so bad amongst the Nahad tribe.\r\n\r\nAll about Hagarein are many traces of the olden days when the\r\nfrankincense trade flourished, and when the town of Doan, which name is\r\nstill retained in the Wadi Doan, was a great emporium for this trade.\r\nAcres and acres of ruins, dating from the centuries immediately before\r\nour era, lie stretched along the valley here, just showing their heads\r\nabove the weight of superincumbent sand which has invaded and overwhelmed\r\nthe past glories of this district. The ruins of certain lofty square\r\nbuildings stand upon hillocks at isolated intervals; from these we got\r\nseveral inscriptions, which prove that they were the high 'platforms'\r\nalluded to on so many Himyaritic inscribed stones as raised in honour of\r\ntheir dead. As for the town around them, it has been entirely engulfed in\r\nsand; the then dry bed of a torrent runs through the centre, and from\r\nthis fact we can ascertain, from the walls of sand on either side of the\r\nstream, that the town itself has been buried some 30 feet or 40 feet by\r\nthis sand. It is now called Raidoun. The ground lies strewn with\r\nfragments of Himyaritic inscriptions, pottery, and other indications of a\r\nrich harvest for the excavator, but the hostility of the Nahad tribe\r\nprevented us from paying these ruins more than a cursory visit, and even\r\nto secure this we had to pay the sheikh of the place nineteen dollars,\r\nand his greeting was ominous as he angrily muttered, 'Salaam to all who\r\nbelieve Mohammed is the true prophet.'\r\n\r\nWe were warned 'that our eyes should never be let to see Meshed again;'\r\nwe might camp before we got there, or after, as we wished, so were led by\r\na roundabout way to Adab, and saw no more of the leprous seyyid who told\r\nsuch wondrous tales about the English king who once lived in Hagarein,\r\nand how the English, Turks, and Arabs were all descended from King Sam.\r\nAlso he told the Addite fable of how the giants and rich men tried to\r\nmake a paradise of their own, the beautiful garden of Irem, and defied\r\nGod, and so destruction came upon the tribe of Ad, the remnant of whom\r\nsurvive at Aden on Jebel Shemshan, in the form of monkeys. This is the\r\nMohammedan legend of the end of the Sabæan Empire.\r\n\r\nWe were much amused with what Imam Sharif said to this seyyid. Imam\r\nSharif is himself a seyyid or sherif, a descendant of Mohammed, his\r\nfamily having come from Medina, so he was always much respected. He said\r\nto him: 'You think these English are very bad people, but the Koran says\r\nthat all people are like their rulers; now we have no spots or diseases\r\non our bodies, but are all clean and sound, which shows plainly that our\r\nruler and the rest of us must be the same. Now you, my brother, must be\r\nunder the displeasure of God, for I see that you are covered with\r\nleprosy.' This was not a kind or civil speech, I fear, but not a ruder\r\none than those addressed to us. This leprosy shows itself by an\r\nappearance as if patches of white skin were neatly set into the dark\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nAt Adab they would not allow us to dip our vessels in their well, nor\r\ntake our repast under the shadow of their mosque: even the women of this\r\nvillage ventured to insult us, peeping into our tent at night, and\r\ntumbling over the jugs in a manner most aggravating to the weary\r\noccupants. The soldiers had abandoned us and gone to sleep in the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nA dreary waste of sand led past Kerren to Badorah. I arrived first with\r\nImam Sharif, a servant, and a soldier. We dismounted, as there was some\r\nsurveying to be done. The people were quite friendly, we thought, though\r\nthey crowded round me shouting to see the 'woman.' I went to some women\r\ngrouped at a little distance, and we had no trouble as long as we were\r\nthere. We had left before the camels came and heard that the rest of the\r\nparty had been very badly received, stones were thrown, and shouts raised\r\nof 'Pigs! Infidels! Dogs! Come down from your camels and we will cut your\r\nthroats.' We attributed this to Saleh Hassan, for he made enemies for us\r\nwherever we went. At this village they were busy making indigo dye in\r\nlarge jars like those of the forty thieves. We were soon out of the Nahad\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOur troubles on the score of rudeness were happily terminated at Haura,\r\nwhere a huge castle, belonging to the Al Kaiti family, dominates a humble\r\nvillage, surrounded by palm groves. Without photographs to bear out my\r\nstatement, I should hardly dare to describe the magnificence of these\r\ncastles in the Hadhramout. That at Haura is seven stories high, and\r\ncovers fully an acre of ground beneath the beetling cliff, with\r\nbattlements, towers, and machicolations bearing a striking likeness to\r\nHolyrood; but Holyrood is built of stone, and Haura, save for the first\r\nstory, is built of sun-dried bricks, and if Haura stood where Holyrood\r\ndoes, or in a rainy climate, it would long ago have crumbled away.\r\n\r\nHaura is supposed to be the site of an ancient Himyaritic town. We were\r\ntold that the sultan of Hagarein is not entirely under Makalla, but that\r\nhe of Haura is.\r\n\r\nThe castle of the sultan is nice and clean inside, and it was pleasant,\r\nafter some very reviving cups of coffee and ginger, and some very public\r\nconversation, to find our canvas homes all erected on a hard field--a\r\npleasant change from our late dusty places. Mahmoud obtained a fox, which\r\nwas his first mammal, saving a bushy-tailed rat. We were sent a lamb and\r\na box of honey, and soon after the governor arrived to request a present.\r\nHe asked thirty rupees but got twenty, and the new soldiers in place of\r\nthe Nahadi men were to have five rupees on arrival at Koton. We were now\r\nnearing the palace of Sultan Salàh-bin-Mohammad al Kaiti of Shibahm, the\r\nmost powerful monarch in the Hadhramout, who has spent twelve years of\r\nhis life in India, and whose reception of us was going to be magnificent,\r\nour escort told us.\r\n\r\nAs we were leaving Haura, just standing about waiting to mount, I felt\r\nsomething hard in one finger of my glove which I was putting on. I\r\nthought it was a dry leaf and hooked it down with my nail and shook it\r\ninto my hand. Imagine my terror on lifting my glove at seeing a scorpion\r\nwriggling there. I dropped it quickly, shouting for Mahmoud and the\r\ncollecting-bottle, and then caught it in a handkerchief. This was the way\r\nthat _Buthia Bentii_ introduced himself to the scientific world, for he\r\nwas of a new species. It turned out that the 'oldest soldier' was father\r\nto the sultan of Haura. He went no farther with us.\r\n\r\nThe next day, three miles after leaving Haura, we quitted the Wadi Kasr\r\nand at last, at the village of Alimani, entered the main valley of the\r\nHadhramout. It is here very broad, being at least eight miles from cliff\r\nto cliff, and receives collateral valleys from all sides, forming, as it\r\nwere, a great basin. Hitherto our way had been generally northward, from\r\nMakalla to Tokhum, north-east, and then north-west; now we turned\r\nwestward down the great valley, though still with a slight northward\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\nWe passed Ghanima, Ajlania on a rock to the right, and Henan and the Wadi\r\nMenwab behind it on our left. Wellsted, in his list of the Hadhramout\r\ntowns, mentions Henan as Ainan, and as a very ancient town, on the hill\r\nnear which are inscriptions and rude sculptures.\r\n\r\nFor seven hours we travelled along the valley, which from its width was\r\nlike a plain till we were within a mile of the castle of Al Koton, where\r\nthe sultan of Shibahm resides. Thus far all was desert and sand, but\r\nsuddenly the valley narrows, and a long vista of cultivation was spread\r\nbefore us. Here miles of the valley are covered with palm groves. Bright\r\ngreen patches of lucerne called _kadhlb_, almost dazzling to look upon\r\nafter the arid waste, and numerous other kinds of grain are raised by\r\nirrigation, for the Hadhramout has beneath its expanse of sand a river\r\nrunning, the waters of which are obtained by digging deep wells. Skin\r\nbuckets are let down by ropes and drawn up by cattle by means of a steep\r\nslope, and then the water is distributed for cultivation through narrow\r\nchannels; it is at best a fierce struggle with nature to produce these\r\ncrops, for the rainfall can never be depended upon. We had intended to\r\npush on to Al Koton, but Sultan Salàh sent a messenger to beg us not to\r\narrive till the following morning, that his preparations to receive us\r\nmight be suitable to our dignity, as the first English travellers to\r\nvisit his domains. So we encamped just on the edge of the cultivation,\r\nabout a mile off, at Ferhud, where under the shade of palm-trees there is\r\na beautiful well of brackish water, with four oxen, two at each side to\r\ndraw up the water.\r\n\r\nOutside the cultivation in its arid waste of sand the Hadhramout produces\r\nbut little; now and again we came across groups of the camelthorn, tall\r\ntrees somewhat resembling the holm oak. It is in Arabic a most\r\ncomplicated tree. Its fruit, like a small crab apple, is called _b'dom_,\r\nvery refreshing, and making an excellent preserve; its leaves, which they\r\npowder and use as soap, are called _ghasl_, meaning 'washing'; whereas\r\nthe tree itself is called _ailb_, and is dearly loved by the camels, who\r\nstretch their long necks to feed off its branches.\r\n\r\nWe wondered what kind of reception we should have, for people's ideas on\r\nthis point vary greatly. In order not to offend the sultan's prejudices\r\ntoo much, we determined to dissemble, and I decided not to wear my little\r\ncamera, and Imam Sharif packed the plane-table out of sight. We settled\r\nthat he should have the medicine chest in his charge and be the doctor of\r\nthe party, and addressed him as Hakim. Even Saleh feared so much what the\r\nfuture might hold in store, that he removed his drawers and shoes, and\r\nadvised Imam Sharif to do the same, as Mohammed had never worn such\r\nthings. Imam Sharif refused to take these precautions, saying that if\r\nMohammed had been born in Cashmere he would have assuredly worn both\r\ndrawers and shoes. Imam Sharif wore a Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers\r\nand a turban when on the march, but in camp he wore Indian clothes.\r\nHowever, we were soon visited by the sultan's two wazirs on spirited Arab\r\nsteeds: magnificent individuals with plaided turbans, long lances, and\r\nmany gold mohurs fixed on their dagger handles, all of which argued well\r\nfor our reception on the morrow by the sultan of Shibahm.\r\n\r\nWe were a good deal stared at, but not disagreeably, for all the soldiers\r\nwere on their best behaviour. At Khaila and Sief we had to be tied up,\r\nairless, in our tents, as if we left them open a minute when the crowd,\r\ntired of seeing nothing, had dispersed, and one person saw an opening,\r\nthe whole multitude surged round again, pressing in, shouting and\r\nsmelling so bad that we regretted our folly in having tried to get a\r\nlittle light and air. We saw among others a boy who had a wound in his\r\narm, and therefore had his nostrils plugged up; bad smells are said not\r\nto be so injurious as good ones. Some women came and asked to see me, so\r\nI took my chair and sat surrounded by them. They begged to see my hands,\r\nso I took off my gloves and let them lift my hands about from one sticky\r\nhand to another. They looked wonderingly at them and said 'Meskin' so\r\noften and so pityingly that I am sure they thought I had leprosy all\r\nover. Then they wished to see my head, and having taken off my hat, my\r\nhair had to be taken down. They examined my shoes, turned up my gaiters,\r\nstuck their fingers down my collar, and wished to undress me, so I rose\r\nand said very civilly, 'Peace to you, oh women, I am going to sleep now,'\r\nand retired.\r\n\r\nArab girls before they enter the harem and take the veil are a curious\r\nsight to behold. Their bodies and faces are dyed a bright yellow with\r\nturmeric; on this ground they paint black lines with antimony, over their\r\neyes; the fashionable colour for the nose is red; green spots adorn the\r\ncheek, and the general aspect is grotesque beyond description.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in bed really late next morning, till the sun rose, and then\r\nprepared ourselves to be fetched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTLE OF THE SULTAN OF SHIBAHM AT AL KOTON]\r\n\r\nThe two young wazirs, Salim-bin-Ali and Salim-bin-Abdullah, cousins, came\r\nagain at 7.30 with two extra horses, which were ridden by my husband and\r\nSaleh, as Imam Sharif stuck to the donkey which we named Mahsoud\r\n(Happy).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nOUR SOJOURN AT KOTON\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a fairy palace of the Arabian Nights, white as a wedding cake, and\r\nwith as many battlements and pinnacles, with its windows painted red, the\r\ncolour being made from red sandstone, and its balustrades decorated with\r\nthe inevitable chevron pattern, the castle of Al Koton rears its\r\nbattlemented towers above the neighbouring brown houses and expanse of\r\npalm groves; behind it rise the steep red rocks of the encircling\r\nmountains, the whole forming a scene of Oriental beauty difficult to\r\ndescribe in words. This lovely building, shining in the morning light\r\nagainst the dark precipitous mountains, was pointed out to us as our\r\nfuture abode. My horse, Basha, seemed to have come to life again and\r\nenjoy galloping once more, for we had left the servants, camels, &c. to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nAs we approached _feux de joie_ announced our arrival, and at his gate\r\nstood Sultan Salàh to greet us, clad in a long robe of canary-coloured\r\nsilk, and with a white silk turban twisted around his swarthy brow. He\r\nwas a large, stout man, negroid in type, for his mother was a slave, and\r\nas generous as he was large, to Arab and European alike. He looked about\r\nfifty-five or sixty, but said his age was 'forty-five or forty.' At\r\nfirst, on being seated in his reception-room, we were very cautious in\r\nspeaking of our plans, as we were surrounded with all sorts and\r\nconditions of men.\r\n\r\nHe placed at our disposal a room spread with Daghestan carpets and\r\ncushions, furnished with two tables and three chairs, and not a mouthful\r\nof our own food would he allow us to touch, a hospitality which had its\r\ndrawbacks, for the Arab _cuisine_ is not one suited to Western palates.\r\n\r\nWe were very glad of this hospitality at first as it would give Matthaios\r\na holiday, which he could devote to the washing of clothes, water being\r\nso plentiful. I will describe one day's meals, which were invariably the\r\nsame. At eight o'clock came several cups, all containing coffee and milk,\r\nhoney, eggs, hard boiled and peeled, and a large thin leathery kind of\r\nbread made plain with water, and another large thin kind made with _ghi_,\r\nand like pastry.\r\n\r\nAbout 2.30 came two bowls like slop-bowls, one containing bits of meat,\r\nvegetables, eggs and spices in sauce, under about an inch of melted\r\n_ghi_, the other a kind of soup. They were both quite different, but at\r\nthe same time very much alike, and the grease on the top kept them\r\nfuriously hot. There were little pieces of boiled lamb, and little pieces\r\nof roast lamb; tiny balls of roast meat and also of boiled; a mound of\r\nrice and a mound of dates; and upon requesting some water we were given\r\none large glassful. Identically the same meal came at 9.30, an hour when\r\nthe _bona-fide_ traveller pines to be in his bed. These things were laid\r\non a very dirty coloured cotton cloth, but no plates or knives, &c. were\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nAt several odd times through the day a slave walked in and filled several\r\ncups of tea, a few for each of us. The cups were never washed by him.\r\n\r\nAfter struggling for a few days, many of the party having had recourse to\r\nthe medicine-chest, we were at length compelled humbly to crave his\r\nmajesty to allow us to employ our own cook. This he graciously permitted,\r\nand during the three weeks we passed under his hospitable roof, our cook\r\nwas daily supplied by the 'sultanas'--most excellent housewives we\r\nthought them--with everything we needed.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features of these Arabian palaces is the\r\nwood-carving. The doors are exquisitely decorated with it, the supporting\r\nbeams, and the windows, which are adorned with fretwork instead of glass.\r\nThe dwelling-rooms are above, the ground floor being exclusively used for\r\nmerchandise and as stables and cattle stalls, and the first floor for the\r\ndomestic offices. The men-servants lie about in the passages. We lived on\r\nthe second floor, the two next stories were occupied by the sultan and\r\nhis family, and above was the terraced roof where the family sleep during\r\nthe summer heat. Every guest-room has its coffee corner, provided with a\r\ncarved oven, where the grain is roasted and the water boiled; around are\r\nhung old china dishes for spices, brass trays for the cups, and fans to\r\nkeep off the flies; also the carved censers, in which frankincense is\r\nburnt and handed round to the guests, each one of whom fumigates his\r\ngarments with it before passing it on. It is also customary to fumigate\r\nwith frankincense a tumbler before putting water into it, a process we\r\ndid not altogether relish, as it imparts a sickly flavour to the fluid.\r\n\r\nWe found the system of door-fastening in vogue a great nuisance to us.\r\nThe wooden locks were of the 'tumbler' order. The keys were about 10\r\ninches long, and composed of a piece of curved wood: at one end were a\r\nnumber of pegs stuck in irregularly, to correspond with a number of the\r\ntumbling bolts which they were destined to raise. No key would go in\r\nwithout a tremendous lot of shaking and noisy rattling, and you always\r\nhad to have your key with you, for if you did not lock your door on\r\nleaving your room there was nothing to prevent its swinging open; and if\r\nyou were inside you must rise and unbolt it to admit each person, and to\r\nbolt it behind him for the same reason.\r\n\r\nWe got very friendly with Sultan Salàh during our long stay under his\r\nroof, and he would come and sit for hours together in our room and talk\r\nover his affairs. Little by little he was told of all our sufferings by\r\nthe way, and was very angry. We also consulted him as to our plans, and\r\ntold him how badly Saleh was behaving.\r\n\r\nWe used sometimes to think of dismissing Saleh, but thought him too\r\ndangerous to part with. It was better to keep him under supervision, and\r\nleave him as much in the dark as possible about our projects.\r\n\r\nThe sultan took special interest in our pursuits, conducting us in person\r\nto archæological sites, and manifesting a laudable desire to have his\r\nphotograph taken. He assisted both our botanist and naturalist in\r\npursuing their investigations into the somewhat limited flora and fauna\r\nof his dominions, and was told by Imam Sharif that his work with the\r\nsextant was connected with keeping our watches to correct time.\r\n\r\nHe would freely discourse, too, on his own domestic affairs, giving us\r\nanything but a pleasing picture of Arab harem life, which he described as\r\n'a veritable hell.' Whenever he saw me reading, working with my needle,\r\nor developing photographs, he would smile sadly, and contrast my\r\ncapabilities with those of his own wives, who, as he expressed it, 'are\r\nunable to do anything but painting themselves and quarrelling.' Poor\r\nSultan Salàh has had twelve wives in his day, and he assured us that\r\ntheir dissensions and backbitings had made him grow old before his time;\r\nhis looking so old must be put down to the cares of polygamy. At Al Koton\r\nthe sultan had at that time only two properly acknowledged wives, whom he\r\nwisely kept apart; his chief wife, or 'sultana,' was sister to the sultan\r\nof Makalla, and the sultan of Makalla is married to a daughter of Sultan\r\nSalàh by another wife; in this way do Arabic relationships get\r\nhopelessly confused. The influence of the wife at Al Koton was\r\nconsiderable, and he was obviously in awe of her, so much so that when he\r\nwanted to visit his other wife he had to invent a story of pressing\r\nbusiness at Shibahm. 'Our wives,' said he one day, 'are like servants,\r\nand try to get all they can out of us; they have no interest in their\r\nhusband's property, as they know they may be sent away at any time.' And\r\nin this remark he seems to have properly hit off the chief evil of\r\npolygamy. He also told us that, having got all they can from one husband,\r\nthey go off to a man that is richer, though how they make these\r\narrangements, if they stick to their veils, is a mystery to me.\r\n\r\nThen again, he would continually lament over the fanaticism and folly of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen, more especially the priestly element, who\r\nsystematically oppose all his attempts at introducing improvements from\r\ncivilised countries into the Hadhramout. The seyyids and the mollahs\r\ndislike him; the former, who trace their descent from the daughter of\r\nMohammed, forming a sort of hierarchical nobility in this district; and\r\non several occasions he has been publicly cursed in the mosques as an\r\nunbeliever and friend of the infidel. But Sultan Salàh has money which he\r\nmade in India, and owns property in Bombay; consequently he has the most\r\nimportant weapon to wield that anyone can have in a Semitic country.\r\n\r\nThe sultan told us a famous plan they have in this country for making a\r\nfortune. Two Hadhrami set out for India together, a father and son, or\r\ntwo brothers. They collect enough money before starting to buy a very\r\nfine suit of clothes each, and to start trade in a small way. They then\r\nincrease the business by credit, and when they have got enough of other\r\npeople's money into their hands, one departs with it to the inaccessible\r\nHadhramout, while the other waits to hear of his safe arrival, and then\r\nhe goes bankrupt and follows him.\r\n\r\nSultan Salàh had not a high opinion of his countrymen, and told us\r\nseveral other tales that did not redound to their credit.\r\n\r\n'Before I went to India I was a rascal (_harami_) like these men here,'\r\nhe constantly asseverated, and his love for things Indian and English is\r\nunbounded. 'If only the Indian Government would send me a Mohammedan\r\ndoctor here, I would pay his expenses, and his influence, both political\r\nand social, would be most beneficial to this country.' It is certainly a\r\ngreat thing for England to have so firm a friend in the centre of the\r\nnarrow habitable district between Aden and Maskat, which ought by rights\r\nto be ours, not that it is a very profitable country to possess, but in\r\nthe hands of another power it might unpleasantly affect our road to\r\nIndia, and in complying with this simple request of Sultan Salàh's an\r\neasy way is open to us for extending our influence in that direction.\r\n\r\nLikewise from a humane point of view, this suggestion of Sultan Salàh's\r\nis of great value, for the inhabitants of the Hadhramout are more\r\nhopelessly ignorant of things medical than some of the savage tribes of\r\nAfrica. Certain quacks dwell in the towns, and profess to diagnose the\r\nailments of a Bedou woman by smelling one of her hairs brought by her\r\nhusband. For every pain, no matter where, they brand the patient with a\r\nred-hot iron (_kayya_); to relieve a person who has eaten too much fat,\r\nthey will light a fire round him to melt it; to heal a wound they will\r\nplug up the nostrils of the sufferer, believing that certain scents are\r\nnoxious to the sore; the pleasant scents being the most harmful. Iron\r\npounded up by a blacksmith is also a medicine.\r\n\r\nOn an open sore they tie a sheet of iron, tin, or copper with four holes\r\nin the corners for strings. We heard of the curious case of a man who\r\nfor a wager ate all the fat of a sheep that was killed at a pilgrimage.\r\nHe lay down to sleep under a shady tree and all the fat congealed in his\r\ninside. The doctor ordered him to drink hot tea, while fires were lit all\r\naround him, and thus he was cured and was living in Shibahm when we were\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWe had a crowd of patients to treat whilst stationed at Al Koton, and I\r\nhave entered quantities of quaint experiences with these poor helpless\r\ninvalids in my note-book.\r\n\r\nWe had many an interesting stroll round the sultan's gardens at Al Koton,\r\nand watched the cultivation of spices and vegetables for the royal table,\r\nor rather floor; the lucerne and clover for his cattle, the indigo and\r\nhenna for dyeing purposes, and the various kinds of grain. But on the\r\ncultivation of the date-palm the most attention is lavished; it was just\r\nthen the season at which the female spathe has to be fructified by the\r\nmale pollen, and we were interested in watching a man going round with an\r\napron full of male spathes. With these he climbed the stem of the female\r\npalm, and with a knife cut open the bark which encircles the female\r\nspathe, and as he shook the male pollen over it he chanted in a low\r\nvoice, 'May God make you grow and be fruitful.' No portion of the palm is\r\nwasted in the Hadhramout: with the leaves they thatch huts and make\r\nfences, the date stones are ground into powder as food for cattle, and\r\nthey eat the nutty part which grows at the bottom of the spathes, and\r\nwhich they called _kourzan_. On a journey a man requires nothing but a\r\nskin of dates, which will last him for days, and, when we left, Sultan\r\nSalàh gave us three goat-skins filled with his best dates, and large tins\r\nof delicious honey--for which the Hadhramout was celebrated as far back\r\nas Pliny's time[11]--which he sent on camels to the coast for us, as\r\nwell as a large inscribed stone that I now have in my house.\r\n\r\nInnumerable wells are dotted over this cultivated area, the water from\r\nwhich is distributed over the fields before sunrise and after sunset. The\r\ndelicious creaking noise made by heaving up the buckets greeted us every\r\nmorning when we woke, delicious because it betokened plenty of water: and\r\nthese early morning views were truly exquisite. A bright crimson tinge\r\nwould gradually creep over the encircling mountains, making the parts in\r\nshade of a rich purple hue, against which the feathery palm-trees and\r\nwhitewashed castles stood out in strong contrast. All the animals\r\nbelonging to the sultan are stabled within the encircling wall, and\r\nimmediately beneath the palace windows; the horses' stable is in the open\r\ncourtyard, where they are fed with rich lucerne and dates when we should\r\ngive corn. Here also reside the cows and bullocks, which are fed every\r\nevening by women, who tie together bunches of dried grass and make it\r\nappetising by mixing therewith a few blades of fresh lucerne; the sheep\r\nand the goats are penned on another side, whilst the cocks and hens live\r\nin and around the main drain. All is truly patriarchal in character.\r\n\r\nThe sultan only possesses four horses, and one of these, a large white\r\nmare, strangely enough came from the Cape of Good Hope, _viâ_ Durban and\r\nBombay. The sultan of Makalla had three. The 'Arab courser' lives farther\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nAs for the soldiers, they sent, as if it were a matter of course, for\r\nsome money to buy tobacco and were given two or three dollars each, and\r\nwe gladly parted from them friends. The sultan of Makalla had paid them\r\nfor a fortnight's food, and had written to Sultan Salàh to pay what was\r\nowing. My groom was dismissed also without bakshish: he was only a rough\r\nfellow taken from the mud brick works at Makalla, and my poor Basha would\r\nhave fared ill if really dependent on M'barrek for care. My entreaties\r\nalone saved him from being publicly bastinadoed, as the sultan wished,\r\nwhen he heard of all his rudeness and disobedience.\r\n\r\nThe sultan was most anxious to arrange for our onward journey, and wrote\r\nseven letters to different sheikhs and sultans, and sent them to us to\r\nread, but we could not read them ourselves, and would not let Saleh, so\r\nwe were none the wiser. The sultans of Siwoun and Terim are brothers, of\r\nthe Kattiri tribe, but have no real authority outside their towns. We\r\nwere anxious to proceed along the Hadhramout valley and to reach the tomb\r\nof the prophet Houd. The sultan also went to Shibahm to meet some of the\r\narbiters of our fate, and the sultan of Siwoun agreed to let us pass: but\r\nothers said we had five hundred camels loaded with arms, and all sorts of\r\nother fables, and they all quarrelled dreadfully about us, so the sultan\r\nreturned to Al Koton to await replies to his letters.\r\n\r\nThe day the sultan was absent, the women were determined to have a little\r\nenjoyment from our presence themselves, so a great many servants came\r\nbringing the sultan's ten-year-old daughter Sheikha, a rather pretty\r\nlittle girl, with long earrings all round her ears, which, like all the\r\nother women's, hang forward like fringed bells. An uneven number is\r\nalways worn, and a good set consists of twenty-three. They are rings\r\nabout two inches in diameter, with long drops attached. Her face was\r\npainted with large dots, stripes, and patterns of various colours, and\r\nshe had thick antimony round the eyes. Her neck, arms, and shoulders were\r\nyellow, and her hands painted plain black inside and in a pattern like a\r\nlace mitten on the back, the nails being red with henna.\r\n\r\nI was also asked to pay a visit to the ladies. I went upstairs. Every\r\nfloor is like a flat, with its bath-room containing a huge vase called\r\n_kazbah_, and the bath is taken by pouring over the person, from a\r\nsmaller utensil, water which runs away down drain-holes to the wooden\r\nspouts. I found myself in some very narrow passages, among a quantity of\r\nnot over-clean women, who all seized me by the shoulders, passing me on\r\nfrom one to the other till I reached a very large carpeted room, with\r\npillows round it, some very large looking-glasses and a chandelier.\r\n\r\nI advanced across the room amid loud exclamations from the seated ladies,\r\nand was pointed out a position in front of the two principal ones, who\r\nwere seated against the wall--one was the chief wife of the sultan, and\r\nthe other a daughter married to a seyyid, whose hand his father-in-law\r\nmust always kiss. He is a very disagreeable-looking man, who was much\r\noffended because Imam Sharif would neither kiss his hand, being a seyyid\r\nhimself, nor let his own be kissed. I squatted down, and round me soon\r\nsquatted many more ladies--they were certainly not beautiful, but one,\r\nwho was nearest to me and seemed to be my guardian or showman, had a very\r\nnice, kind, clever face. Her lips were not so large as most.\r\n\r\nWe seemed all to be presided over, as we literally were, by a kind of\r\nconfidential maid, who sat on the little raised hearth in the corner,\r\namongst all the implements for the making of coffee and burning of\r\nincense, chanting constantly: 'Salek alleh Mohammed' and something more,\r\nof which I can only remember that it was about the faith. Sometimes she\r\nwas quiet a little, and then, above all the din, she raised her shout,\r\naccompanying it with an occasional single loud blow with a stone pestle\r\nand mortar. There was no difficulty about seeing the gold anklets the\r\nladies wore, for their clothes, as they sat, were well above their knees.\r\nTheir feet were painted like fanciful black slippers with lace edges.\r\nTheir examination of me was very searching, even reaching smelling point,\r\nand I feel sure I was being exorcised, for so much was being said about\r\nMohammed. At last an old lady said to me, 'There is no god but God!' with\r\nwhich I agreed, and murmurs of satisfaction went round, while she nodded\r\nher head triumphantly. Later on she pointed to the ceiling, and asked if\r\nI considered this was the direction in which Allah dwells, and seemed\r\nglad when I agreed. Of course no infidel would, she thought.\r\n\r\nPresently the woman who had prepared the frankincense brought it down in\r\na small chafing dish, continuing the same chant and handing it round. I\r\nwondered if I should be left out, or left till the last, but neither\r\nhappened, and when my turn came, like the rest, I held my head and hands\r\nover the fumes, and we were all fumigated inside our garments. I may have\r\nbeen partaking in some unholy rite, but my ignorance will be my excuse, I\r\nhope.\r\n\r\nI was then told I might go, which I was glad of, as I had been afraid to\r\noffend them by going too soon. I was asked, as I left, if I should like\r\nto see their jewellery; of course I said 'Yes,' and had hardly got home\r\nand recovered from the deafening row, when I was fetched again.\r\n\r\nThere were crowds more women of all classes, clean and dirty, and as they\r\ncame trooping in to see me, the room seemed to resound with the\r\ntwittering sound of their kisses, for the incoming visitor kissed the\r\nsitter's hand, while the sitter kissed her own, and there was kissing of\r\nforeheads besides.\r\n\r\nNumerous little baskets were brought in with immense quantities of gold\r\nornaments, some very heavy, but with few gems in them--absolutely none of\r\nvalue. They consisted of coral, onyx, a few bad turquoises, crooked\r\npearls, and many false stones. Everything was of Indian work. Sheikha\r\ncame in in a silk dress with a tremendous, much-alloyed silver girdle,\r\nand loaded with chains and bracelets of all sorts, clanking and clashing\r\nas she came.\r\n\r\nWe had very good coffee with ginger and cloves in it, and at this time\r\nthere was a very great deal of religious conversation and argument, and\r\nas they were exciting themselves I thought I would go, for I did not feel\r\nvery comfortable; but the chief lady said to me, in a very threatening\r\nand dictatorial voice:\r\n\r\n'La illaha il Allah! Mohammed resoul Allah.' I looked as much like an\r\nidiot as I could, and pretended neither to notice nor understand, but I\r\nwas patted and shaken up by all that were near-enough neighbours to do\r\nso, and desired to look at that lady.\r\n\r\nAgain she said 'La illaha il Allah' in the same tone, and I was told I\r\nmust repeat it. So she said the first part again in a firm tone, and I\r\ncheerfully repeated after her, 'There is no god but God.'\r\n\r\nThen she continued, 'Mohammed is his prophet.' I remained dumb. Then the\r\nname of Issa (Jesus) went round, and I bowed my head.\r\n\r\nThe coffee woman then called out, 'Issa was a prophet before Mohammed.'\r\n\r\nThey then asked me if Issa was my prophet. I could only say that He is,\r\nfor my Arabic would not allow of a further profession of my faith.\r\n\r\nI gladly departed and gave Sheikha afterwards two sovereigns for her\r\nnecklace.\r\n\r\nThey said they would show me their clothes, but they never did. I have\r\ndescribed the shape of these dresses, but I omitted to say that they are\r\ngaily trimmed with a kind of ribbon about two inches wide, made of little\r\nsquare bits of coloured silks and cottons sewn together. This is put\r\nround the armholes, over the shoulder, and down to the hem of the garment\r\nover the seam, where a curious gusset or gore runs from the front part\r\nto the corner of the train. The dress is trimmed round the neck, which is\r\ncut square and rather low, and generally hangs off one shoulder, and,\r\nacross the breast it is much embroidered, beads and spangles being\r\nsometimes introduced. These women seem to live in a perpetual noise: they\r\ngurgled loudly when we arrived, and we could always hear them playing the\r\ntambourine.\r\n\r\nTiny girls wear, as their only garment, a fringe of plaits as in Nubia,\r\nand their heads are shaven in grotesque patterns, or their hair done in\r\nsmall plaits. Boys have their heads shaven also, all except locks of long\r\nhair dotted about in odd places. I never saw such dreadful objects as the\r\nwomen make of themselves by painting their faces. When they lift their\r\nveils one would hardly think them human. I saw eyes painted to resemble\r\nblue and red fish, with their heads pointing to the girl's nose. The\r\nupper part of the face was yellow, the lower green with small black\r\nspots, a green stripe down the nose, the nostrils like two red cherries,\r\nthe paint being shiny. Three red stripes were on the forehead, and there\r\nwas a red moustache, there being also green stripes on the yellow cheeks.\r\n\r\nThere was a delightful, tiny room on the roof, just a little place to\r\ntake and make coffee in, and we were allowed to clamber up to this, but\r\nnot without calling a slave and assuring ourselves that there was no\r\ndanger of my husband meeting any of the ladies, for it commanded the\r\nroof, to which we had not access. We liked going up there very much, for\r\nthe views were splendid, and we could see down into the mosque, which is\r\nbuilt like cloisters, open in the middle. I took some photographs from\r\nthere, and also, with the greatest difficulty, managed to get one of the\r\nroom itself by tying my camera, without its legs, of course, with a rope\r\nto the outside of the fretwork frame of the little window, which was on a\r\nlevel with the floor. It was hard work not to be in the way myself, as I\r\nhad to put both arms out of the next window to take out the slides, and\r\nto guess at the focus.\r\n\r\nThe sultan, though his Hindustani was getting a trifle rusty, said he\r\ngreatly liked the company of Imam Sharif, whose uncle had in some way\r\nbefriended him in India. Intelligent conversation he had not enjoyed for\r\na long time. He was certainly a little scandalised at Imam Sharif's lax\r\nways in religion, for he was one day sitting without his turban when some\r\ncoffee was brought. The sultan put his hands up to cover Imam Sharif's\r\nhead, saying:\r\n\r\n'My brother, you are drinking with a bare head, and this is contrary to\r\nthe Koran.' The same remark was often made in camp by people who looked\r\ninto his tent. They said, 'Look! he is a Christian, his head is bare.' At\r\nthe same time no one thought anything of the Bedouin's bare heads.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of uncertainty we made several little explorations of\r\nthe surrounding valleys.\r\n\r\nOne day we started out with the sultan, who had on his long coat, which\r\nmade him look like a huge, sulphur-coloured canary. It was lined with\r\nlight blue. He, my husband, Saleh, and a groom rode the four horses; Imam\r\nSharif and I had our Basha and Mahsoud, and a camel most smartly\r\ndecorated carried the Wazir Salim-bin-Abdullah and a soldier; other\r\nsoldiers followed on foot. We went about five miles to Al Agran to see\r\nsome ruins perched on a rock beneath the high wall of the plateau,\r\nprettily situated with palms, gardens, and wells. The ruins, which are\r\nthose of a well-built fortress, consist of little more than the\r\nfoundation, but all embedded in modern houses, so that excavations would\r\nbe impossible. It must once have been a place of considerable importance.\r\nThere was a scrap of very well cut ornament, which looked as if it might\r\nhave belonged to a temple. It was from Al Agran or Algran that we\r\nobtained a stone with a spout to it, with rather a long Sabæan\r\ninscription on it, a dedication to the god Sayan, known to have been\r\nworshipped in the Hadhramout. We were given coffee in a very dirty room,\r\nwhich we were all the time longing to tear down that we might dig under\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASTLE OF THE SULTAN OF MAKALLA AT SHIBAHM]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Pliny, vi. 28, § 161: 'Mellis ceraeque proventu.']\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE WADI SER AND KABR SALEH\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 17 we started from Al Koton with only seven of our camels and\r\ntwo of the sultan's packed with forage, to be away several days. The\r\nsultan wished to lend his horses, but my husband refused. However, he had\r\nto ride one, a grey, for fear of giving offence, and this was given to\r\nhim as a present afterwards, and he rode it whenever the rocks allowed\r\ntill we reached the coast. We eventually sent this horse, Zubda (butter),\r\nand my Basha back to their respective donors, though they really expected\r\nus to take them to Aden. We had two men of the Nahad tribe as our\r\n_siyara_.\r\n\r\nOur start took a very long time, for the sultan, attended by many people,\r\ncame a mile on foot. We travelled four hours and a half, partly through\r\nland that would have been cultivated had there been rain, and partly\r\nthrough salt desert, till we turned north-west into the Wadi Ser, where\r\nthere is a sandy desert. From the entrance to Wadi Ser we could see\r\nShibahm in the distance, an unpromising looking spot among sandhills. We\r\nwere all able to find shelter at Hanya under an enormous thorny _b'dom_\r\ntree covered with fruit, and we felt like birds out of a cage, for we\r\nnever could walk out at Al Koton without a crowd, and the greasiness and\r\nspiciness of the food was beginning to pall. We had a delightful camp,\r\nbut had to be very careful not to drop things in the sand, as they so\r\nquickly disappeared. We had a new man called Iselem, who was to take\r\ncare of the horses, pluck chickens, and help in pitching the camp. His\r\nwonder at the unfolding and setting up of the beds, chairs, &c., was\r\ngreat. There was also an old man called Haidar Aboul. He and one of the\r\nsoldiers could talk Hindustani, so with Imam Sharif's help we were\r\nsomewhat independent of Saleh, though we had thought it necessary to\r\nbring him, to keep him from working us harm.\r\n\r\nWe continued our way up the Wadi Ser for about five hours and camped at\r\nAl Had in a field near a house, close to some high banks which radiated\r\nintense heat, and suffered the more that we had to wait a long time for\r\nthe tea that we always had with our luncheon, as our water had been\r\nstolen in the night. We always tried to save some to carry on and start\r\nwith next day, fearing we might fare worse in the next place we came to.\r\n\r\nThe well at this spot is the last water in this direction, for we were\r\nreaching the confines of the great central desert. Wadi Ser, being such a\r\nwaste of sand, is very sparsely populated. The Bedouin here, like the\r\nTurkomans, live in scattered abodes, little groups of two or three houses\r\ndotted about, and solitary homesteads. It belongs to the Kattiri tribe,\r\nwho are at war with the Yafei. They once owned Sheher and Makalla and\r\ntook Al Koton, but in a war in 1874 the Yafei were supported by the\r\nEnglish; hence their friendship for England. The animosity still\r\ncontinues and there is little intercourse between Siwoun and Shibahm,\r\nthough only twelve miles apart. The Kattiri have more of the Bedou about\r\nthem and the Yafei have more of the Arab. Our _siyar_ was twenty-five\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe people were preparing for rain, which may never come; they had had\r\nnone for two years, but if they get it every three years they are\r\nsatisfied, as they get a sufficient crop. As it comes in torrents and\r\nwith a rush, each field is provided with a dyke and a dam, which they\r\ncut to let the water off. This dyke is made by a big scraper, like a\r\ndustpan, called _mis'hap_, harnessed by chains to a camel or bullocks.\r\nThe camel goes over the existing bank and when the dustpan reaches the\r\nsummit the men in attendance upset the surface sand or soil, that has\r\nbeen scraped off, and carry the scraper down. When this is done the field\r\nis lightly ploughed; there is nothing more to do except to sit and wait\r\nfor rain. We saw signs of great floods in some parts.\r\n\r\nWhenever we found ruins still visible in or near the Hadhramout we found\r\nthem on elevated spots above the sand level, from which we may argue that\r\nall centres of civilisation in the middle of the valleys lie deeply\r\nburied in sand, which has come down in devastating masses from the\r\nhighland and the central desert. The nature of the sand in this district\r\nis twofold. Firstly we have the _loess_ or firm sand, which can be\r\ncultivated; and secondly the disintegrated desert sand, which forms\r\nitself into heaps and causes sandstorms when the wind is high.\r\n\r\nThe mountains diminish in height the farther north one goes. The\r\ncharacter of the valleys is pretty much the same as that of those to the\r\nsouth of the main valley, only they are narrower and much lower, and thus\r\nthe deep indenture of the valley system of the Hadhramout gradually fades\r\naway into the vast expanse of the central desert.\r\n\r\nThe wazir had been given a bag of money to buy fowls and lambs for us,\r\nbut Saleh came and said, 'The wazir wants some money for a lamb,' so it\r\nwas sent and returned. It had not been asked for and caused some offence,\r\nbut that odious little wretch only wished to make mischief.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin are rather clever at impromptu verses, and when we were in\r\nWadi Ser they made night hideous by dancing in our camp. The performers\r\nranged themselves in two rows, as in Sir Roger de Coverley; time is kept\r\nby a drum and by perpetual hand-clapping and stamping of the feet, whilst\r\ntwo men execute elaborate capers in the centre, singing as they do so\r\nsuch words as these: 'The ship has come from Europe with merchandise;\r\nthey shot at the minaret with a thousand cannon.' Bedouin women also take\r\npart in these dances, and the Arabs think the dances very impious; it was\r\nvery weird by the light of the moon and the camp-fire, but wearisome when\r\nwe wanted to sleep, particularly as they kept it up till after we were\r\nall astir in the morning, yelling, bawling, singing, and screeching,\r\nIselem being the ringleader. The ground was shaken as if horses were\r\ngalloping about. A Bedou was playing a flute made of two leg-bones of a\r\ncrane bound together with iron.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of half an hour from our camp there is a stone with an\r\ninscription. This was visited on the day of our arrival, but we went\r\nagain next day that I might photograph it, very difficult in the position\r\nin which it is. It is a great rough boulder about 10 feet high, that has\r\nslipped down from the mountain, with large rough Sabæan letters just\r\npunched on the surface, of no depth, but having a whitish appearance. The\r\nletters run in every direction--sometimes side by side, sometimes in\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\nThe central and most important word which my husband was able to make\r\nout, with the help of Professor Hommels' admirable dictionary of hitherto\r\nascertained Himyaritic words, is _Masabam_ or Caravan road. The stone\r\nseemed to be a kind of sign-post; for as the old Bedou sheikh who was\r\nwith us said, there was in olden days, about 500 years ago, a caravan\r\nroad this way to Mecca, before the Bahr-Safi made it impassable. The\r\nBahr-Safi is a quicksand, north of Shabwa, but none of those present had\r\nbeen there, and they all laughed at Von Wrede's story of King Safi and\r\nhis army being engulfed in it.\r\n\r\nThe Bedou sheikh with his retinue came to see that we took no treasure\r\nout of the stone. There are a good many old stones built into the side of\r\nthe stream-bed. Having taken a copy and a photograph, which my husband\r\nsent later to Dr. D. H. Müller, in Vienna, to decipher, we departed. We\r\nwere told that the Wadi Ser goes four hours from that stone to the great\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nWe then turned back and followed our _kafila_ to Alagoum, at the junction\r\nof Wadi Ser and the Wadi Latat, about two hours' journey. Alagoum is a\r\nlarge cluster of high houses, surrounded by stables and houses excavated\r\nin the sandhills, where the inhabitants and their cattle live in hot\r\nweather. This is quite an idea suited to the Bedouin, who live in caves,\r\nwhen they can find them. The Bedouin in Southern Arabia never have tents.\r\n\r\nWe found that Saleh had joined the camel-men in resisting our own people,\r\nwho wanted to encamp under trees. They had unloaded in the open and Saleh\r\nand Iselem had then retired into the village till the tents were pitched,\r\nso, as we were to remain in this place two days, we had them moved. We\r\nhad by this time some of the Kattiri tribe with us as _siyara_.\r\n\r\nAt Al Garun the Wadi Ser is entered by a short collateral valley called\r\nthe Wadi Khonab, in which valley is the tomb of the prophet Saleh, one of\r\nthe principal sacred places of the district. Kabr Saleh is equally\r\nvenerated with the Kabr Houd, also called the tomb of the prophet Eber\r\n(for, from what we could gather from the statements of intelligent\r\nnatives, Eber and Houd are synonymous terms) which is to be found in the\r\nTamimi country further up the main valley.\r\n\r\nThe prophet Houd was sent to reclaim the tribe of Ad. The Mahra tribe are\r\ndescended from a remnant of the Addites, as also are the Hadhrami,\r\naccording to the legends. Once a man named Kolabeh, when seeking for\r\ncamels came upon the beautiful garden of Irem-Dhatul-Imad, which is\r\nsupposed to have been in the desert near Aden; he found and brought away\r\na priceless jewel which came into possession of the first Ommiad Caliph\r\nNourrijaht. Those who embraced Islamism on the preaching of the prophet\r\nHoud were spared, but the rest either were suffocated by a stifling wind\r\nor survived in the form of apes, whose descendants still inhabit Jebel\r\nShemshan at Aden.\r\n\r\nA remnant are also said to have fled to the Kuria Muria Islands.\r\n\r\nWe again met with considerable opposition from the Bedouin and our escort\r\nwhen we proposed to visit the Kabr Saleh next day. However, this was\r\novercome by threats of reporting the opposition to Sultan Salàh on our\r\nreturn to Al Koton. So next morning we started. The sultan of Shibahm's\r\npeople were just as anxious to go as we were, for they were delighted to\r\nget the chance of making this pilgrimage to so holy a place, which being\r\nin an enemies' country they could not have done but for our escort.\r\n\r\nA short ride of two hours brought us nearly to the head of the Wadi\r\nKhonab, and there, situated just under the cliff, in an open wilderness,\r\nis the celebrated tomb. It consists simply of a long uncovered pile of\r\nstones, somewhat resembling a potato-pie, with a headstone at either end,\r\nand a collection of fossils from the neighbouring mountains arranged\r\nalong the top. Hard by is a small house where the pilgrims take their\r\ncoffee, and the house of the Bedou mollah, who looks after the tomb, is\r\nabout a quarter of a mile off. Beyond this there is no habitation in\r\nsight. A more desolate spot could hardly be found. The tomb is from 30 to\r\n40 feet in length, and one of the legends concerning it is that it never\r\nis the same length, sometimes being a few feet shorter, sometimes a few\r\nfeet longer. The Bedouin have endless legends concerning this prophet.\r\nHe was a huge giant, they said, the father of the prophet Houd, or Eber;\r\nhe created camels out of the rock, and hence is especially dear to the\r\nwandering Bedou; and he still works miracles, for if even unwittingly\r\nanyone removes a stone from this grave, it exhibits symptoms of life, and\r\ngives the possessor much discomfort until it is returned. Once a domed\r\nbuilding was erected over the tomb, but the prophet manifested his\r\ndislike of being thus inclosed and it was removed.\r\n\r\nMen are said to go blind if they steal anything connected with the tomb;\r\nonce a man took a cup from the coffee-house, unaware of the danger he\r\nincurred, tied it to his girdle, and carried it off. It stuck to him till\r\nhe restored it. Another man took a stone away and gave it to his children\r\nto play with, but it hopped about till taken back again.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the _ziara_ or pilgrimage which takes place in November,\r\ncrowds of Bedouin, we were told, come from all the valleys and hills\r\naround to worship. All our men treated the grave with the greatest\r\nrespect, and said their prayers around it barefoot.\r\n\r\nI do not know what they would have done to Imam Sharif if he had not\r\ncomported himself as the others did, so that wretched man had to walk\r\nbarefoot all round on the sharp stones, and thus we obtained the\r\nmeasurements. He got dreadfully pricked by thorns and coveted the fossils\r\nvery much. The stones of which the tomb is composed are about the size of\r\ncannon-balls, and look just as if newly put together and quite weedless.\r\nPeople stroke the upright stone at the head and then rub their hands on\r\ntheir breast and kiss them, and do the same at the foot. The wazir would\r\nhave led us up close to it; but the Bedouin hated our being there at all,\r\nand would by no means let us sleep there, as we wished to do. We\r\noverheard our horrid little Saleh Hassan telling the bystanders that we\r\nlive on pork.\r\n\r\nWhen we first got there, we were permitted to approach within a few yards\r\nof the tomb, so that we saw it very distinctly; but when, after eating\r\nour luncheon, and taking a siesta under a tree, we again advanced to\r\ninspect it, the Bedou mollah attacked us with fierce and opprobrious\r\nlanguage, and, fearing further to arouse the fanaticism of these wild\r\npeople, we speedily mounted our horses and rode away.\r\n\r\nWe hoped to be able to visit Kabr Houd, the tomb of Nebi Saleh's son, in\r\nthe main valley, but, as it will appear, we were to be disappointed. I am\r\ntold, on reliable Arab authority, that it is similar in every way to the\r\nKabr Saleh--just a long pile of stones, about 40 feet in length,\r\nuncovered, and with its adjacent mosque. These two primitive tombs of\r\ntheir legendary prophets, zealously guarded and venerated by the Bedouin,\r\nare a peculiar and interesting feature of the Hadhramout. It is a curious\r\nfact that when one turns to the tenth chapter of Genesis (the best record\r\nwe have of the earliest populations of our globe) we find the patriarchal\r\nnames Salah, Eber, and Hazarmaveth (which last, as I previously stated,\r\ncorresponds to Hadhramout) following one another in their order, though\r\nnot in immediate sequence. I am at a loss to account for these names\r\nbeing still venerated by the Bedouin, unless one admits a continuity of\r\nlegendary history almost too wonderful to contemplate, or else one must\r\nconsider that they were heathen sites of veneration, which have, under\r\nMoslem influence, been endowed with orthodox names. Certain it is that\r\nthese tombs in the midst of the wilderness are peculiarly the property of\r\nthe Bedouin, and, though visited, and to a certain extent venerated, by\r\nthe Arabs, the latter do not attach so much importance to them as they do\r\nto the tombs of their own walis or saints, which are always covered\r\ntombs, near or in the centre of the towns. Another curious point I may\r\nmention in connection with these tombs is that the Arab historian, Yaqut,\r\nin his 'Mu'gam,'[12] tells us of a god in the Hadhramout, called Al\r\nGalsad, who was a gigantic man; perhaps this god may have some connection\r\nwith the giant tombs of Saleh and Eber. Also Makrisi, who wrote in the\r\ntenth century, a.d., speaks of a giant's grave he saw near Shabwa.\r\n\r\nNear Al Agoum we saw a quantity of very ancient stone monuments, situated\r\non slightly elevated ground, above the sand. At first we imagined them to\r\nbe tombs, but on closer inspection we discovered that the erections,\r\nwhich are large unhewn ones of the cromlech type, are decorated inside\r\nwith geometric patterns somewhat similar to those we found in the\r\nMashonaland ruins, and therefore my husband was more inclined to believe\r\nthey were originally used for religious purposes. There are traces of\r\nletters above the pattern. The buildings are about 20 feet square and\r\nseveral are surrounded by circular walls. They are apparently of extreme\r\nantiquity, and doubtless far anterior in date to any other Himyaritic\r\nremains that we saw in the Hadhramout.\r\n\r\nThe wazir joined us as usual on our return from Kabr Saleh, as we sat\r\noutside our tent in the moonlight with Imam Sharif and the Indian\r\ninterpreters, and we had a pleasant evening. We were perfectly charmed to\r\nsee great preparations for sleep going on among the Bedouin. We thought\r\nthey really must be tired after dancing the whole night and walking the\r\nwhole day. They were busy putting themselves to bed in graves which they\r\ndug in the loose dust, not sand; turbans, girdles, and so forth being\r\nturned into bedclothes. Just as they were still Iselem began capering\r\nabout and they all got up shouting and screaming, but the wazir, seeing\r\nmy distress, with the greatest difficulty quieted them, as he did when\r\nthey broke out again at three o'clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nIt took us six hours the following day to ride back to Al Koton, where,\r\nnot being expected, we could not get a meal of even bread, honey, and\r\ndates for about an hour and a half, and then had to wait till we were\r\nvery sleepy indeed for supper. We endured great hunger that day.\r\n\r\nSalim-bin-Ali, the other wazir, had not come with us because he was not\r\nwell. The day of our reception, in curvetting about, he fell from his\r\nhorse and had suffered various pains ever since.\r\n\r\nThe sultan had had another stone brought for us from Al Gran; we did not\r\ncare to take this away as it had very little writing on it, only [Symbol:\r\nscript] (_al amin_, to the protection). It is circular, 1 foot 4½ inches\r\nin diameter, 2½ inches high, made of coarse marble. We saw a similar\r\ncircular stone at Raidoun.\r\n\r\nThe wildest reports were going about as to the water-stone we already\r\nhad. It was almost the cause of an insurrection against the sultan of\r\nShibahm. They said 'It was very wrong to give that stone to a\r\n\"gavir\"'--as they call us (for all the _k_'s are pronounced _g_)--'only\r\nthink of our carelessly letting him have it. The Englishman has taken\r\nfifteen jewels of gold and gems out of it,' and named a high value.\r\n\r\n'You are sure of this?' said the sultan to the ringleader.\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes! quite certain!' he said.\r\n\r\nSo the sultan led him to our room, where the stone was, and said:\r\n\r\n'Do you know the stone again? Look closely at it. Has anything happened\r\nto it but a washing?'\r\n\r\nThe man looked extremely small. They said my husband's only business was\r\nto extract gold from stones. It is extraordinary how widespread this\r\nbelief is. It is firmly rooted in Greece. Many a statue and inscription\r\nhas been shivered to atoms because of it, and our interest in\r\ninscriptions was constantly attributed to a wish to find out treasure. We\r\nonce saw two men in Asia Minor industriously boring away into a\r\ncolumn--to find gold they told us. They already had made a hole about 8\r\ninches deep and 4 or 5 inches wide. They think that the ancients had a\r\nway of softening marble with acid.\r\n\r\nWe had again at this time a great many patients; for, as we really had\r\neffected some cures the first time we were at Al Koton, our fame had\r\nspread. We always had Matthaios and Imam Sharif to help us to elicit the\r\nsymptoms, and also to consult with as to the cures, because some remedies\r\nwhich suit Europeans were by no means suited to the circumstances of our\r\npatients. For instance, the worst coughs I ever heard were very\r\nprevalent, but it would be useless to ask the sick to take a hot footbath\r\nand stay in bed. The one blue garment, which in different shapes was all\r\nthe men and women wore, was little protection from the chill of the\r\nevening. The women's dresses were always hanging off their backs; and the\r\nmen, who had each two pieces of thick blue cotton about 2 yards long by\r\n1½ yard wide, with fringes half a yard long, wore one as a permanent\r\npetticoat and the other as a girdle by day and when cold as a shawl,\r\noften put on in a very uncomfortable way--thrown on in front and left\r\nhanging open behind--forming no protection to the back of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe poor little baby, aged fifteen months, of the Wazir\r\nSalim-bin-Abdullah was brought shrieking in agony, gnawing hard at its\r\nemaciated little arms, and all covered with sores. Our hearts were wrung\r\nat this wretched sight and we longed to help; we even thought of giving\r\nit part of a drop of chlorodyne much diluted, but, fortunately for us,\r\ndared not do so, for my husband said to them, 'I do not think the child\r\nwill live long.' It mercifully was released in a few hours. Then an old\r\nman came who 'had a flame in his inside.' My husband examined him and\r\ndecided that he had an abscess, and, to please him, gave him a\r\ndessertspoonful of borax and honey, which he swept up with his finger,\r\nand I suppose it did relieve him, for after some minutes he said: 'The\r\nfire is gone out.'\r\n\r\nIt grieved us sorely when poor souls came to us so hopefully and so\r\nconfident of help, with a withered arm or an empty eye-socket. Some with\r\nless serious complaints than these last we recommended to go to Aden\r\nhospital, a building of which we never thought at that time we should be\r\ninmates ourselves. We found the ladies, to whom a plentiful supply of\r\nviolent pills had been administered, were better, but the sultan, who had\r\nan attack of indigestion, had to be taken in hand at once by us doctors.\r\nHis wife required a tonic, so we got out some citrate of iron and\r\nquinine, a bright, shiny, greenish-yellow, flaky thing, which Imam Sharif\r\nassured us would be more beneficial and better liked if shown and admired\r\nas gold; so after some conversation about pious frauds, I packed the\r\nmedicine up neatly and wrote in ornamental letters 'Golden Health Giver,'\r\nand this name being explained and translated gave great satisfaction. We\r\nwere glad to be able to give the kind sultan a new bottle of\r\nquinine--more acceptable than gold.\r\n\r\nWhile we were away Mahmoud had found two little hedgehogs. One was dead\r\nand stuffed; the other we kept alive for some time and it always liked to\r\ncreep into my clothes and go to sleep--I suppose because I never teased\r\nit. In the little book of directions for zoological collectors we saw,\r\nthat 'little is known of the reproduction of lizards, so special\r\nattention is to be paid,' &c. Mahmoud had brought me two little fragile\r\neggs to keep, about half an inch long, and I had put them in a match-box\r\nwith tow and packed them in my trunk, and on my return to Al Koton I\r\nfound two little lizards about 1¼ inch long, one alive and the other\r\ndead. Both had to be pickled, as we did not understand how to bring so\r\nsmall a lizard up by hand. They proved to be new to science, as was also\r\na large lizard we had found near Haura, whose peculiarity is that he has\r\nno holes along his legs to breathe by, like other lizards. His name is\r\n_Aporosceles Bentii_. The first lizard's egg I had I was determined\r\nshould not slip through my fingers; but alack! and well-a-day! my fingers\r\nslipped through it.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we were terrible bones of contention, and had the Wadi\r\nHadhramout all by the ears. We were very anxious indeed as to whether we\r\ncould proceed any farther or should have to go back, and whether we could\r\ndo either safely. We wanted to go right along the Wadi Hadhramout and to\r\nsee Bir Borhut or Barahout, a _solfatare_ as far as we could make out,\r\nbut Masoudi in the tenth century speaks of it as the greatest volcano in\r\nthe world, and says that it casts up immense masses of fire and that its\r\nthundering noise can be heard miles away. On the heights near is much\r\nbrimstone, which the Bedouin find useful for gunpowder. They consider\r\nthis place is the mouth of hell and that the souls of Kafirs go there. In\r\nIceland there is similar accommodation for those souls. Von Wrede thinks\r\nit was the Fons Stygis of Ptolemy, but M. de Goeje thinks that Ptolemy\r\nalluded to some place farther west and south of Mareb. Certainly the\r\nposition given by Ptolemy does not coincide with that of Bir Borhut.\r\n\r\nFrom 'Arabian Society in the Middle Ages,' by S. Lane-Poole, I take the\r\nfollowing notices of this place:--\r\n\r\nEl Kaswini says of Bir Borhut: 'It is a well near Hadhramout and the\r\nProphet (God bless and save him) said \"In it are the souls of infidels\r\nand hypocrites.\" It is an Addite well in a dry desert and a gloomy\r\nvalley, and it is related of Ali (may God be well pleased with him) that\r\nhe said, \"The most hateful of districts to God (whose name be exalted)\r\nis the valley of Barahout, in which is a well whose waters are black and\r\nfoetid, where the souls of infidels make their abode.\"'\r\n\r\nEl Asmaï has narrated of a man of Hadhramout that he said: 'We find near\r\nBarahout an extremely disgusting and foetid smell, and then news is\r\nbrought to us of the death of a great man of the chiefs of the infidels.'\r\n\r\nAjaïb el Makhloukàt also relates that a man who passed a night in the\r\nvalley of Barahout said: 'I heard all night (exclamatives) of \"O Roumèh!\r\nO Roumèh!\" and I mentioned this to a learned man and he told me that it\r\nwas the name of the angel commissioned to keep guard over the souls of\r\nthe infidels.'\r\n\r\nBir Borhut is not far from Kabr Houd, which is said by some to be even\r\nlonger and wider than Kabr Saleh. The route lies through the territory of\r\nthe Kattiri, and the Yafei are quite ignorant of it; it would be quite\r\nunsafe for them to go to the sea along the valley, and they always use\r\nthe road over the tableland. The Kattiri tyrannise over the sultan of\r\nSiwoun and are enemies to the sultan of Shibahm; beyond them are the\r\nMinhali, who are also enemies; then the Amri and the Tamimi, who are\r\nfriendly, and then come the Mahri. The sultan told us that not even he\r\ncould prevent us going along the _kafila_ path, but we should not be\r\nadmitted into any villages and should probably be denied water. One\r\nsource of enmity between the Kattiri and the Yafei is, I believe, a debt\r\nwhich the Kattiri owe and will not pay. The sultan of Siwoun borrowed\r\nthree lacs of rupees from the grandfather of the present sultan of\r\nMakalla; he would not repay them, so after much squabbling the case was\r\nreferred to the English at Aden, who, after duly considering the papers,\r\ngave Makalla and Sheher (bombarding them first) to the Yafei.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the seven letters there was nothing from the sultan of\r\nSiwoun, and the sultan of Terim sent a verbal answer--'Do as you please,'\r\ntaking no responsibility--to which Sultan Salàh replied, 'I have sent you\r\na letter, send me a letter.' The sheikh of the Kattiri tribe came to Al\r\nKoton and said he would take us, but on January 23 we heard that the\r\nsultan of Siwoun had made a proclamation in the mosque there, forbidding\r\nthe people to admit the unbelievers to the town. Though we could easily\r\ngo by the _kafila_ road, leaving the town of Siwoun two miles on one\r\nside, the sultan deemed it wiser for us not to attempt it, as brawls\r\nmight arise, the two tribes being at war; so we then decided to mount on\r\nto the akaba, pass the inhospitable Siwoun and Terim, and reach the\r\nfriendly Tamimi tribe. The Kattiri _kabila_, or tribe, really came to\r\nSiwoun to be ready for us, but the seyyids had collected a large sum of\r\nmoney and bribed the sultan to send them away.\r\n\r\nWe were hoping to get off to Shibahm, but as the sultan was neither well\r\nnor in a very good humour, we had to resign ourselves to settling down in\r\nAl Koton in all patience. He said he must accompany us, as he could not\r\ndepend on his wazirs for they were too stupid.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I were always occupied. He used to sketch in\r\nwater-colours, and I had plenty of work developing photographs in a\r\ndelightful little dark room, where I lived and enjoyed as many skins of\r\nwater as I could use, till I had to stop and pack my celluloid negatives\r\nlike artificial flowers, for they curled up and the films contracted and\r\nsplit, from the alkaline water. I had to put glycerine on them when I\r\nreached Aden. Our botanist nearly died of dulness and impatience; Mahmoud\r\nwas quite contented to sit quite still, and I do not think the Indian\r\nservants minded much. Poor Imam Sharif used to gaze up at half a dozen\r\nstars from a yard, but he dared not venture on the roof to see more.\r\n\r\nWe took a stroll with the sultan one day, no crowd being allowed, and\r\nremarked how many things were grown for spices, those spices which were\r\nbecoming rather wearisome to us. There was _zamouta_, an umbelliferous\r\nplant, the seed of which is used in coffee, and _habat-assoba_ for\r\nputting in bread; coriander, chili, fennel, and _helf_, a plant very like\r\ntall cress, which is used in cookery and also raw, and which we liked as\r\na salad; also _attar_, a purple creeping bean, very pretty and good to\r\neat. There was also another low-growing bean, _brinjol_ (egg plant),\r\ncucumber, water-melon, henna, and indigo. The sultan has besides a\r\nprivate inclosure where he has some lime-trees, not our kind of lime-tree\r\nof course, but the one which bears fruit; and I must not forget cotton,\r\nfrom which the place originally took its name, as it is abundant in a\r\nwild state.\r\n\r\nAt last another polite letter came from the Kattiri, and a letter from\r\nthe sultan of Terim. 'I have both your letters _and you can do as you\r\nlike_, my answer is the same.' This did away with all hope of progress in\r\nthat direction.\r\n\r\nOur spirits, however, were much cheered by hearing that the sultan had\r\nreceived a letter from a seyyid at Meshed (probably the nice one who had\r\nbeen in India and had leprosy in his legs), telling him how very badly\r\nthe sultan of Hagarein had behaved about us. As this was spontaneous, we\r\nhoped that the negotiation our sultan was going to undertake about our\r\nmaking excavations at Meshed, Raidoun, or Kubar al Moluk (for some part\r\nof the ruins is called Tombs of the Kings), would turn out successfully.\r\nThe sultan of Hagarein was summoned to Al Koton, but we were away before\r\nhe came. I believe in the end he was turned out of his place, former\r\nmisdeeds counting against him.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: II., 100.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF SHIBAHM\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 25 we started for Shibahm, carpets having been sent forward\r\nthe day before. The sultan was to follow us in a day or two, when some\r\nsheikhs had been to see him. We started at 8.30 and were at Shibahm in\r\nfour hours. We had eleven camels only, three horses, and the donkey. We\r\ntravelled, as soon as we left Al Koton, through sand nearly all the way.\r\nWe passed the tall white dome of Sheikh Aboubekr-bin-Hassan's tomb, near\r\nwhich the ruling family are buried if the seyyids permit. They are\r\nall-powerful, and the sultan can do nothing in this respect without\r\nthem--not even be buried in his own family tomb. There is a well beside\r\nthe tomb, or rather the kind of building from which water is obtained in\r\nthe open valleys. This consists of a small white building 8 or 9 feet\r\nsquare, with a dome resting on an open pattern composed of a herring-bone\r\ncourse of bricks; a little wooden ladle, 4 or 5 inches wide, stands in\r\none of the little openings to dip out the water, which would otherwise\r\nevaporate. They drink out of the ladle, and fill the water-skins and the\r\ndrinking trough for animals, which stands always near. They would never\r\nlet us drink from the ladles.\r\n\r\nAs we neared Shibahm we passed through a good deal of ground that had\r\nonce been irrigated, but it had had its ups and downs, and was now\r\nabandoned. First there had been plenty of soil and the palm-trees were\r\nplanted in it. Then the wind had denuded the roots, some of which had\r\nbeen banked up and walled in with stones; others were standing on bare\r\nroots, but at this time the sand was burying the whole place. There were\r\nhigh drifts against many of the walls and among the trees.\r\n\r\nShibahm is twelve miles distant from Al Koton, and is one of the\r\nprincipal towns in the Hadhramout valley. It is built on rising ground in\r\nthe middle of the narrowest part of the valley, so that no one can pass\r\nbetween it and the cliffs of the valley out of gunshot of the walls. This\r\nrising ground has doubtless been produced by many successions of towns\r\nbuilt of sun-dried bricks, for it is the best strategical point in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nEarly Arab writers tell us that the Himyaritic population of this\r\ndistrict came here when they abandoned Shabwa, early in the Christian\r\nera. We succeeded, however, in finding evident traces of an occupation of\r\nearlier date than this, both in a seal, which is described further on,\r\nand in an inscription in which the name Shibahm occurs, and which\r\ncertainly dates from the third century b.c. Even if Shibahm were not the\r\nsite of the original capital it must always, centuries before our era,\r\nhave been a place of considerable importance as the centre of the\r\nfrankincense trade, for here must have been made up the caravans which\r\nbrought the spices westward by the great frankincense road across Arabia.\r\nThe caravans take twenty-five days on the journey to Saihut, and five to\r\nMakalla; they go also to Nejd, but we could not find out how long they\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nShibahm is now the property of the sultan of Makalla, but was\r\nadministered by his cousin Salàh, who received 40,000 rupees a year for\r\nthe purpose. It is now three hundred years since these Yafei left their\r\nold home and came to settle in the Hadhramout. They were then a wild\r\npredatory race, plundering caravans; now they have become peaceable and\r\nrich. They still remain close friends with the Yafei farther west, but\r\nare quite independent of them. It is the maintenance of a residence for\r\nthe Nizam of Hyderabad, and their constant communication with India, that\r\nhas doubtless made all the difference between the Yafei tribe and others.\r\nBuilding seems to have been their mania. The sultan of Shibahm has\r\nnumbers of houses at Al Koton and Shibahm, and he was intending to spend\r\n20,000 rupees in rebuilding his father's house, for the castle at Al\r\nKoton is not his own but Government property, and the strip of land\r\nacross the valley, part of it sandy, goes with it. He was buying up land\r\nfor himself in the Wadi Al Ain and elsewhere. He told us his father left\r\neleven million rupees to divide among his numerous progeny.\r\n\r\nRelationships in that family must be a trifle confused. Manassar of\r\nMakalla had married two sisters (both now dead) of his cousin Salàh.\r\nSalàh had married two of Manassar's sisters. A daughter of Salàh's\r\nmarried Manassar, and another of them was married to one of Manassar's\r\nsons, and Manassar's brother Hussein of Sheher married, or was married\r\nto, a third daughter of Salàh. Apparently the same complications existed\r\nin the generation before this, but into them it is impossible to go. As\r\nin India, the favourite marriage that a man can make is to marry his\r\n'uncle's daughter.' Possibly the fact that property goes from brother to\r\nbrother till a whole generation is dead, instead of from father to son,\r\nhas something to do with this arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe town of Shibahm offers a curious appearance as one approaches; above\r\nits mud brick walls, with bastions and watch towers, appear the tall\r\nhouses of the wealthy, whitewashed only at the top, which make it look\r\nlike a large round cake with sugar on it. Outside the walls several\r\nindustries are carried on, the chief of which is the manufacture of\r\nindigo dye. The small leaves are dried in the sun and powdered, and then\r\nput into huge jars and filled with water. Next morning these are stirred\r\nwith long poles, producing a dark-blue frothy mixture; this is left to\r\nsettle, and then the indigo is taken from the bottom and spread out on\r\ncloths to drain; the substance thus procured is taken home and mixed with\r\ndates and saltpetre. Four pounds of this indigo to a gallon of water\r\nmakes the requisite and universally used dye for garments, the better\r\nclass of which are calendered by beating them with wooden hammers on\r\nstones. This noise was a great mystery to us till we traced our way to it\r\nand found out what it was. They used also to beat the dried leaf of a\r\nkind of acacia called _kharrad_, and, when pounded, make of it a paste\r\nwhich has a beautiful pea-green appearance; it is used for giving a\r\npolish to leather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SABÆAN ALTAR]\r\n\r\nAnother industry carried on outside Shibahm is rope-making out of the\r\nfibres of the fan palm (_saap_) which grows wild in the narrower valleys;\r\nthe leaves are first left to soak in water, and then beaten till the\r\nfibres separate. Yet another is that of making lime for whitewash\r\nkilns--it is curious to watch the Bedouin beating the lime thus produced\r\nwith long sticks, singing quaint little ditties as they thump, in\r\npleasant harmony to the beating of their sticks.\r\n\r\nWe entered the town by some very sloping steps, which led through the\r\ngateway, passing some wells and the indigo dyers outside; also some\r\nhorrible pools where they had put the little fish that the camels eat, to\r\ndrain the oil from them. We entered a sort of square, having the castle\r\non the right-hand side and a ruined mosque in front of us. This huge\r\ncastle was built by the grandfather of the Sultan Manassar, sultan of\r\nMakalla, but, owing to some difference about his wives, he left the two\r\ntopmost stories unfinished. No one lives in it, so we had the whole of\r\nthis immense pile of buildings to ourselves. It belongs to Manassar. It\r\nis larger than Al Koton by far, and that is also exceeded in size by\r\nHaura. It is a most imposing structure and much more florid than the\r\nothers. The gateway is a masterpiece of carving in intricate patterns. On\r\nentering this you turn sharp to the right up a shallow staircase,\r\nprotected from without, but exposed to fire from the inmates of the\r\ncastle. The pillars in the lofty rooms are beautifully carved. All the\r\nwindows are filled with pretty fretwork; bolts, doors, and window frames\r\nare also carved. The huge doors are carved on one side only, the outer\r\none, and inside they are rough and ill-grained and splashed with\r\nwhitewash. There are pretty dado patterns round the walls; and the\r\nstaircase, as in the other castles, has numerous doors for defence,\r\nusually put in the middle of the flights. Shooting-holes are in every\r\ndirection. We established ourselves in a room about 30 feet by 25 feet,\r\nand used to go up and dine in one of the unfinished rooms at the top\r\nwhere there was a little bit of roof and where the cooking was done. We\r\ngenerally thought it wise to dine in our grill-room, in order to have our\r\nfood hot. We all greatly enjoyed the works of our own cooks, provisions\r\nbeing supplied to us.\r\n\r\nWe overlooked a huge puddle into which the surrounding houses drain, and\r\nit is a proof of the scarcity of water in this part of Arabia, that they\r\ncarefully carry this filthy fluid away in skins to make bricks with, even\r\nscraping up the remaining drops in the pool with their hands. In fact, it\r\nscarcely ever rains in the Hadhramout.\r\n\r\nFrom the roof of our lofty castle we had an excellent view straight down\r\nthe broad Hadhramout valley, dotted with towns, villages, palm groves,\r\nand cultivation for fully thirty miles, embracing the two towns of Siwoun\r\nand Terim, ruled over by the two brother sultans of the Kattiri tribe.\r\nClose to Shibahm several collateral valleys from north and south fall\r\ninto the Hadhramout, and a glance at the map made by our chartographer,\r\nImam Sharif, Khan Bahadur, will at once show the importance of this\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nShibahm is the frontier town of the Yafei tribe, the Kattiri occupying\r\nthe valley about two miles to the east, and these two tribes are\r\nconstantly at war. Sultan Salàh's big standard was in one of our\r\ndwelling-rooms ready to be unfurled at a moment's notice. He has cannons\r\non his walls pointed in the direction of his enemy--old cannons belonging\r\nto the East India Company, the youngest of which bore the date of 1832.\r\nFrom the soldiers we obtained a specimen of the great conch shells that\r\nthey use as trumpets in battle, and which are hung to the girdle of the\r\nwatchmen, who are always on the look-out to prevent a surprise.\r\n\r\nThe Kattiri are not allowed to stay in the town at night, for we heard\r\nthat seven months before some of them were detected in an attempt to blow\r\nup the palace with gunpowder. There was a fight also, about a quarter of\r\na mile outside the town, in which five Kattiri and seven Yafei were\r\nkilled. There are three or four armed soldiers to protect Shibahm, the\r\nsultan has erected bastions and forts all about it, and the walls are\r\npatrolled every night.\r\n\r\nThere are many ruined houses in the plain, relics of the great war forty\r\nyears ago, when the Kattiri advanced as far as Al Koton and did great\r\ndamage. The sultan of Siwoun was invited, with seven sheikhs, to the\r\npalace of Shibahm on friendly terms and there murdered in cold blood,\r\nwhile forty of his followers were killed outside.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Shibahm were not at all friendly disposed to us. On\r\nthe day of our arrival my husband ventured with two of the sultan's\r\nsoldiers into the bazaar, and through the narrow streets; but only this\r\nonce, for the people crowded round him, yelled at him, and insulted him,\r\ntrying their best to trip him up and impede his progress; he was nearly\r\nsuffocated by the clouds of filthy dust that the mob kicked up, and\r\naltogether they made his investigations so exceedingly disagreeable that\r\nhe became seriously alarmed for his safety, and never tried to penetrate\r\ninto the heart of Shibahm again. On the whole I should accredit Shibahm\r\nwith a population of certainly not less than six thousand souls: there\r\nare thirteen mosques in it, and fully six hundred houses, tall and gaunt,\r\nto which an average population of ten souls is but a moderate estimate.\r\nThe slave population of Shibahm is considerable; many slaves have houses\r\nthere, and wives and families of their own. The sultan's soldiers are\r\nnearly all slaves or of slave origin, and one of them, Muoffok, whose\r\ngrandfather was a Swahili slave, and who had been one of our escort from\r\nMakalla, took us to his house, where his wife, seated unveiled in her\r\ncoffee corner, dispensed refreshments to quite a large party there\r\nassembled, whilst Muoffok discoursed sweet music to us on a mandoline,\r\nand a flute made out of the two bones of an eagle placed side by side.\r\n\r\nTaisir and Aboud were also abiding in Shibahm. Taisir when he met us, on\r\nthe minute asked for bakhshish, saying he had been ill when we parted and\r\nhad had none though we had sent it to him. Oh! there was such kissing of\r\nhands! so we thought it politic to love our enemy and gave him a present.\r\nThe Wazir Salim-bin-Ali had travelled with us to take care of us in the\r\nabsence of his master.\r\n\r\nOnce the Arabs had a good laugh at the expense of three members of our\r\nparty. One morning our botanist went forth in quest of plants and found a\r\ncastor-oil tree, the berries of which pleased him exceedingly. Unwilling\r\nto keep so rare a treat for himself, he brought home some branches of the\r\ntree, and placed the delicacy before two of our servants, Matthaios and,\r\nI am glad to say, Saleh, who also partook heartily. Terrible was the\r\nanguish of the two victims, which was increased by the Arabs, veritable\r\ndescendants of Job's comforters, who told them they were sure to die, as\r\ncamels did which ate these berries. The botanist did not succumb as soon\r\nas the others, who, not believing he had eaten any berries himself, vowed\r\nvengeance on his head if they should recover, and demanded that, to prove\r\nhis innocence, he should eat twelve berries in their presence. To our\r\ngreat relief the botanist was at last seized with sickness, and thereby\r\nproved his guiltlessness of a practical joke; three more miserable men I\r\nnever saw for the space of several hours. However, they were better,\r\nthough prostrate, next day, and for some time to come the popular joke\r\nwas to imitate the noises and contortions of the sufferers during their\r\nanguish.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the enmity manifested towards us we were even debarred\r\nfrom walking in that interesting though smelly part, just outside the\r\ntown under the walls with the well, the brick-works, the indigo, the\r\noil-making, the many lime-kilns, the armourers, and all the industrious\r\npeople of the town.\r\n\r\nWe used to take the air on the roof in the evening; there were no\r\nmosquitos, but we were never so persecuted with flies. Fortunately our\r\ncastle was near the wall, for to dwell in the narrow, tortuous, dirty\r\nstreets must be fearful--most likely the dust does much to neutralise the\r\nevils of the defective drainage. The houses are very high and narrow and\r\nbuilt of mud brick (_kutcha_), which is constantly though slowly\r\npowdering away. There are many houses in ruins.\r\n\r\nWe had two or three days of slight cold. The temperature was 62° (F.) in\r\nthe shade, and it was so cloudy that we expected rain, but none came.\r\n\r\nSaleh managed to get ten rupees from my husband, who refused any more,\r\nthough he brought a piece of cloth which he said he wished to buy from\r\nthe sultan. The money was only wanted for gambling. He went to Imam\r\nSharif and said, 'How is this that Mr. Bent, who at first was like my\r\nbrother, now is quite changed?' Imam Sharif said, 'If he was kind to you\r\nwhen you were a stranger, and now that he knows you is different, there\r\nmust be some reason for it.' 'What have I done?' 'You know best,' said\r\nImam Sharif, 'and I advise you to beg pardon.' Saleh exclaimed, 'And you,\r\nwho are a Moslem, take part against me with these Christians!' This is\r\nthe keynote of his conduct to us.\r\n\r\nWe rode two hours one day, without Saleh, to a place called Kamour, on\r\nthe southern side of the valley, where there is an inscribed stone at the\r\nmouth of a narrow slit or gorge leading to the akaba. The words thereon\r\nwere painted light red, dark red, yellow, and black, and scratched. The\r\ndecipherable words 'morning light' and 'offerings' point to this having\r\nbeen a sacred stone when sun worship was prevalent. The letters are well\r\nshaped, some letters being strange to us. The writing is _boustrephedon_,\r\nwhich means that it runs backward and forward like an unbroken serpent,\r\neach line being read in an opposite direction to that preceding or\r\nfollowing it. There is no difficulty in seeing this at a glance, as the\r\nshapes of the letters are reversed; for instance, if this occurred in\r\nEnglish the two loops of a B would be on the left, if the writing were to\r\nbe read in that direction, [Symbol: reverse B]. The Greek name comes from\r\nthis style of writing being originally likened to cattle wandering about.\r\nThis at once relegates it, according to the best authorities, to at least\r\nthe third century before Christ, and we were forcibly reminded of the\r\nlarge stone in the ruins of Zimbabwe and its similar orientation.\r\n\r\nWe heard of a cave with an inscription in it in the Kattiri country,\r\nabout six miles off, almost in sight. We longed 'to dance on Tom\r\nTiddler's ground' and make a dash for it, but the forfeits we might incur\r\ndeterred us, being our lives. The wazir said he would try to arrange for\r\nthis, but that, even if the seyyids consented, we must take forty\r\nsoldiers, well armed, pay them as well as _siyar_ to the Kattiri, pay the\r\nexpenses of the _siyara_, and take as short a time about the business as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th we heard that some of the tribe of Al Jabber, descended from\r\nMohammed's great friend of that name, had passed Shibahm for Al Koton to\r\nfetch us, but there was no news of the Minhali or of the Tamimi.\r\n\r\nIt was said that the Jabberi could not take us over their highland, past\r\nthe Kattiri and into the Tamimi country, without consulting the Kattiri,\r\nwho sometimes help them in their wars. It must be remembered that the\r\nKattiri Bedouin were for us (no doubt in view of the payment of _siyar_),\r\nwhile the seyyids and Arabs of that tribe at Siwoun, and their friends at\r\nTerim, were against us.\r\n\r\nI need not say we were weary of this indecision, so we sent a letter to\r\nthe sultan of Shibahm by a messenger saying, 'We have been here three\r\ndays; what are we to do next?' and planned that Imam Sharif should ride\r\nover next day, as he could communicate 'mouth to mouth' with the sultan\r\nin Hindustani.\r\n\r\nWe had one consolation in our imprisonment, for the seal of Yarsahal,\r\nwhich has been mentioned before, was brought to us. The stone is in brown\r\nand white stripes, and the setting is very pretty. It had been in the\r\nbezel of a revolving ring. We began bargaining for it at once, my husband\r\noffering ten rupees for the stone and ten for the golden setting, but the\r\nseyyid who brought it said it was the property of a man in Siwoun, who\r\nwished to keep it for his children, and he must take it back to him. My\r\nhusband said 'he should like to look at it very quietly by himself and\r\nthink over the stone,' and therefore asked the seyyid to remain outside\r\nthe door for a few minutes. I quickly utilised this quiet time to make\r\nan impression with sealing-wax, in case we never saw the seal again. In\r\ntwo hours the seyyid appeared again, and said he had had a letter from\r\nSiwoun (twenty-four miles off), saying the (imaginary) owner would not\r\npart with it under thirty rupees, but he very soon took twenty and\r\nlaughed most heartily when I said if I had known how near Siwoun was I\r\nwould have gone myself.\r\n\r\nThis seal is of particular interest, for on it were the words 'Yarsahal,\r\nthe Elder of Shibahm'; and in an inscription published by M. Halévy, we\r\nhave the two Yarsahals and various members of this family described as\r\nvassals of the King of the Gebaniti. Now Pliny says that the capital of\r\nthe country was Thumna; this is quite correct and was confirmed by the\r\nseal, for Thumna was the capital of the Gebaniti, who were a Himyaritic\r\ntribe, west of the Hadhramout. It is therefore an additional confirmation\r\nof the accuracy of the ancient geographers concerning this district.\r\n\r\nIn old days Shabwat, as it is called in inscriptions, or Sabbatha, Shaba,\r\nand Sabota, as it is written in the ancient authors, was the capital of\r\nthe country. Hamdani tells us in his 'Geography of the Arabian Peninsula'\r\nthat there were salt works at Shabwa, and 'that the inhabitants, owing to\r\nthe wars between Himyar and Medhig, left Shabwa, came down into the\r\nHadhramout and called the place Shibahm, which was originally called\r\nShibat.' Times are much changed since Shabwa was a great town, for from\r\nall accounts it is now quite deserted save for the Bedouin, and is six\r\ndays from good water; the water there is salt and bitter, like quinine,\r\nthe sultan said. The Bedouin work the salt and bring it on camels, as is\r\nmentioned by Makrisi. The effect of salt is traceable in the water of all\r\nthe wells in the main valley. We would gladly have gone into Shabwa, but\r\nit was obviously impossible.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of gun-firing when the Jabberi went by with the\r\nsheikh of the Kattiri, and our next interest was a letter from Al Koton,\r\nsaying 'that the Tamimi, who had sworn on their heads and their eyes to\r\ndo so, had never appeared, and that the Jabberi wanted 110 dollars,\r\nexclusive of camel hire, to go with us, the camels only to go a short\r\ndistance, and then we must change. What did we wish to do?'\r\n\r\nOf course we could not start without providing camels for our onward way,\r\nso this answer was sent back: 'We have not come to fight; we do not much\r\ncare when we go, and we await the advice of the sultan when he comes\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\nSaleh was quite delighted, but we thought any direction would be good for\r\nour map and we still had hopes of digging near Meshed, though we began to\r\nhave fears that a repulse eastward would strengthen the hands of our\r\nenemies westward.\r\n\r\nOn January the 29th a letter was brought to us by the wazir and the\r\ngovernor of the town, attended by Saleh, more pleased than ever. They\r\nsaid the letter had arrived last night and it was to say that the\r\nsultan's pain had increased, so he could not come to-day, and adding what\r\nwe already knew as to the three neighbouring tribes.\r\n\r\nWe had a council of three, and feeling that the journey to Bir Borhut was\r\nout of the question, we determined to beat what we hoped would be a\r\nmasterly retreat, so the wazir and the governor were summoned and the\r\nfollowing answer was sent:\r\n\r\n'We cannot understand the letters of the sultan, having no means of\r\ncommunicating with him privately. Therefore we will return to Al Koton\r\nto-morrow, and see him face to face.'\r\n\r\nThe servants were all quite delighted at this, for Saleh told them the\r\nletter was to say we and the soldiers were all going to be murdered.\r\n\r\nWe had stayed five days in Shibahm, and on the first three had taken\r\nsundry walks in the neighbourhood, but during the last two we never\r\nventured out, as the inhabitants manifested so unfriendly a disposition\r\ntowards us. After the Friday's prayer in the mosque, a fanatical mollah,\r\nAl Habib Yaher-bin-Abdullah Soumait, alluded to our unwelcome presence,\r\nand offered up the following prayer three times: 'O God! this is contrary\r\nto our religion; remove them away!' and two days afterwards his prayer\r\nwas answered. This very gentleman had not long before been imprisoned for\r\npraying to be delivered from the liberal-minded Sultan Salàh, but the\r\npeople had clamoured so much that he was released.\r\n\r\nAs we halted at the well outside the town, whilst the various members of\r\nour caravan collected, we overheard a woman chide a man for drawing too\r\nmuch water from the well, to which he replied, 'We have to wash our town\r\nfrom the infidel this day.' Needless to say we gladly shook the dust of\r\nShibahm off our feet, and returned to the flesh-pots of Al Koton with\r\nconsiderable satisfaction. Of a truth, religion and fanaticism are\r\ntogether so deeply engrained in the Hadhrami, that anything like friendly\r\nintercourse with the people is at present next to impossible.\r\n\r\nReligion is the moving spirit of the place; without religion the whole\r\nHadhramout would have been abandoned long ago as useless, but the\r\ninhabitants look upon it as the most sacred spot on earth, Mohammed\r\nhaving been born in Arabia, and hence their objection to its being\r\nvisited by unbelievers. The Shafi sect prevails to the exclusion of all\r\nothers. The men go in crowds to India, Batavia, and elsewhere, sometimes\r\nremaining absent twenty years from their wives and families, and indeed\r\nwe were told of one case in which a husband had been away for forty\r\nyears. They return at last to spend their gains and die in their native\r\nsanctity.\r\n\r\nWe reached Al Koton on January 30, and found our friend the sultan very\r\nwell indeed. We had begun to suspect we were being deceived as to his\r\nillness, for when the wazir and Saleh, who seemed in league together,\r\nheard the seyyid son-in-law, who came straight from Al Koton soon after\r\nthe letter, telling us that the sultan was much better, they looked\r\ndisconcerted, whispered together, and the wazir said, 'You should not\r\ntalk of what you know nothing about.'\r\n\r\nWe were most anxious to learn all that had gone on in our absence, and\r\nwhat arrangements had been made. It seemed to be considered a mistake our\r\never having gone to Shibahm, but I do not think it was. Had we not gone\r\nwe should never have seen that fine and interesting town, and assuredly\r\nnot have obtained King Yarsahal's seal.\r\n\r\nThe sultan told us there had been a great uproar about us, and all the\r\nYafei tribe were now considered Kafirs. The Kattiri absolutely refused\r\nthe Jabberi leave to conduct us, and the Nahadi, through whose lands we\r\nhad passed from Hagarein, said that if they had known how the Kattiri\r\nwould treat us, they would have treated us just the same. It would be\r\nmadness to go to Shabwa, as we should, even if we could get there, be\r\nonly further hemmed in; the Wadi bin Ali was closed to us, the Nahadi\r\nwere between us and Meshed; nevertheless, the sultan had actually sent a\r\nman to ask if we could dig there a few days, he camping with us. Our very\r\nfaint hope of this was only founded on the fact that the seyyids of\r\nMeshed are at enmity with those of Siwoun.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, the Tamimi sent to say they had really started to fetch\r\nus, but the Kattiri told them they would declare war on them unless they\r\nretired.\r\n\r\nThe following evening we were thrown into some excitement by the arrival\r\nof the sultan in our room with seven letters, the general tenor of which\r\nwas that eight of the Tamimi had come, with the _siyara_ of four Amri\r\nonly, and no _siyara_ of Kattiri, as far as Siwoun, and asked to be\r\npassed on, but that the Kattiri refused them safe conduct; they asked the\r\nsultan of Shibahm to go to Shibahm and arrange for them to reach us. They\r\nproposed that we should, without touching Shibahm, turn into the very\r\nnext wadi and go up on to the akaba; the men who went with us were to\r\nstay with us all the way to the coast. The sultan promised to keep\r\nhostages till his returning soldiers told of our safety. We had another\r\ncouncil with Imam Sharif. We counted up our dollars, for we had to live\r\non our money-bags till we reached the sea, and determined to reach Bir\r\nBorhut if we could, saying nothing to the servants to upset their minds\r\ntill all was settled.\r\n\r\nThe sultan went away to Shibahm the next day, and, as usual, the women\r\nbecame very noisy, and during his absence we were close prisoners, on\r\naccount of our fear of being mobbed. The Indian party were generally\r\nlooked upon as Jews.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the sultan came back, telling us that the Tamimi wished to\r\nbring 400 soldiers unpaid (?) and to take us through their country, but\r\nthe Kattiri were too strong for them. They said, 'One man came disguised\r\nto see us (Herr von Wrede), one man came undisguised (Herr Hirsch), and\r\nnow a party has come. Next time it will be a larger one still, and then\r\nit will be all over with the sacred valley of the Hadhramout.' Saleh,\r\nmeanwhile, was doing all he could to annoy us. When we were talking over\r\nour difficulties with Imam Sharif, he strutted in with a bill for the\r\ncamels. My husband said:\r\n\r\n'It is already paid.'\r\n\r\n'I shall see about others then,' Saleh said.\r\n\r\n'They are ordered already.'\r\n\r\n'Your groom, Iselem, will not go with you,' said Saleh.\r\n\r\nSo I told him, 'He won't get the chance; we would not have him if we were\r\npaid, and though we have paid him beforehand, we willingly lose our\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\n'I must, then, speak to the sultan about him, for you.'\r\n\r\nI said, 'The sultan has decided what he will do with him, and I don't\r\nthink he will like it.'\r\n\r\n'Haidar Aboul will not go with you.'\r\n\r\nThis made us very angry, as we had seen that Saleh had been tampering\r\nwith him, lending him his donkey and his sandals when he walked, and\r\nwhispering with him. He tried to separate everyone from us. Haidar had\r\npromised to go with us all the way, and later Imam Sharif brought him to\r\nme when I was at home alone, and made him repeat his promise, and\r\nassurance that he had never told Saleh he would not go.\r\n\r\nSaleh also wanted money, but was refused; he got 100 rupees a month, and\r\n200 were prepaid at Aden. He gambled, and my husband wished to keep the\r\ncontents of our money-bags for our own use. We calculated that at the\r\ncheapest, for soldiers and _siyara_ and camels, Bir Borhut would cost\r\n130_l._ Saleh had put all the servants in a most terrible fright, and a\r\nsoldier had told them that if we went beyond Shibahm we should all be\r\nkilled, and that we should find no water by the way. So we had to explain\r\nto them the plan of going by Wadi bin Ali, and to comfort them as well as\r\nwe could. These people never seem to think that we value our own lives as\r\nmuch as they do theirs.\r\n\r\nMeshed was also closed against us. The sultan of Siwoun and the seyyids\r\nhad sworn on the Koran not to let us proceed on our journey; the Kattiri\r\nhad also sworn and sent messages to the Tamimi of Bir Borhut, the Jabberi\r\nof Wadi bin Ali, and the Nahadi, and they were all against us.\r\n\r\nWe had another day of anxiety and uncertainty as to when we should really\r\nstart, as the camels were not collected till late. We watched eagerly\r\nfrom our tower, counting them as they arrived by twos and threes.\r\n\r\nWe were rather in despair as as we sat dining in a yard, for at this time\r\nwe were started with our own cookery, and dined near the kitchen, which\r\nMatthaios had been able to make in an arched recess of the inclosure,\r\nwhere there were high hills of date-stones, kept to be ground to paste\r\nfor cattle-food.\r\n\r\nHe could not be allowed to defile a Mohammedan kitchen.\r\n\r\nAfter a very few minutes, however, my husband had an idea, which was to\r\ngo to Sheher somehow, and turn up inland from thence; there were plenty\r\nof Tamimi there to help us, and we could thus get to the east side of the\r\nKattiri. Saleh was to know nothing till all was settled.\r\n\r\nFebruary 7 was a very weary day of waiting; for we had mended and cleaned\r\neverything we possessed, and we packed and hoped the camels would come,\r\nexpecting to be off on the morrow, but it was not till evening that\r\npeople, I cannot remember of what tribe, came to bargain with us, and the\r\nbargaining continued next morning; so we made all baggage ready to be\r\ntied into bundles, for we had no doubt we should start on the 8th at\r\nlatest.\r\n\r\nFirst they said we must go by the Wadi al Ain, their own home, and this\r\nwe knew was that they might blackmail us; but they told us it was from\r\nwant of water on the high ground, over which we must travel for six days,\r\nand that we must take two camels for water. Then they said we should take\r\nseventeen days in all, and were to pay for twenty at more than double the\r\nusual fare. We should have to go back on our old road as far as Adab,\r\nthen three days in the Wadi al Ain region, the same road near Haibel\r\nGabrein, go on to Gaffit, and thence turn eastward to Sheher.\r\n\r\nWe were perfectly horrified at this plan; the price was great, and the\r\nsultan seemed not to think it possible to go against the Bedouin; but far\r\nworse in our eyes was the thought of our map, as we should see no new\r\ncountry, instead of taking a turn or a climb that would have added miles\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThey left us, and we were sitting on our floor in the deepest depths of\r\ndark despair, when news came that these camel-men, having made a fresh\r\nplan for more extortions, _i.e._ that there was to be no limit to the\r\nnumber of camels, save their will in loading them, the sultan, being\r\nindignant, was thinking of sending for other men.\r\n\r\nWhen we heard that we roused up and concocted a new plan, which was to\r\nsend for the sultan and ask him to get the Jabberi, and make them take us\r\nby the Wadi bin Ali; so he came and agreed to this. We were not to go so\r\nlong over the highland, but to go up and down at least twice, which would\r\nsuit us and our map. The sultan told us we should find running water, and\r\nthat it was a shorter way to Sheher.\r\n\r\nBesides this, there lurked in the background, not to be revealed till the\r\nlast moment, a design to get the Tamimi to come to a place in Wadi Adim\r\nand take us to Bir Borhut, a name truly terrible to Matthaios and the\r\nIndian servants.\r\n\r\nWe were in high spirits, and agreed that no matter what our fate might be\r\nwe were having a delightful evening. Truly I think the pleasures of hope\r\nare not sufficiently appreciated, for even if your hopes are never\r\nrealised the hoping has been a great happiness. On the 8th those\r\nextortionate men of Wadi al Ain sent to say they would take us by the\r\nWadi bin Ali, turning out of Wadi Hadhramout at Al Gran, crossing the\r\nWadis bin Ali and Adim, and reaching Sa'ah, where we could branch off for\r\nBir Borhut. This offer was declined, for we were watching and waiting for\r\nthe Jabberi; and at night we heard that the brave Jabberi were at\r\nShibahm, whereas our messenger had been sent to Wadi bin Ali. They said\r\nthey wondered at not hearing from us, as the sultan had engaged their\r\ncamels and promised to let them know when they would be wanted. It was a\r\ngreat mystery to us why the Wadi al Ain people had ever been sent for.\r\n\r\nThe Jabberi thus defied the Kattiri: 'As sure as we come from Jabberi\r\nfathers and Jabberi mothers, we will take these people safely to Bir\r\nBorhut; and as sure as you come from Kattiri fathers and Kattiri mothers,\r\nyou may do your worst but still we will keep them safe'; to which the\r\nKattiri replied: 'We do not wish to make war on you, and we do not care\r\nwhere you take them so long as it is not into our country.'\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had finished our breakfast next day, a message came to say\r\nour horses were ready, and we were to go and drink coffee at a little\r\ntower the sultan has in the plain. Most of the party walked. There were\r\nonly horses for five; a donkey carried a water-skin, and our donkey,\r\nMahsoud, carried halters for every animal. There were the two wazirs, the\r\nson-in-law, the sultan of Haura, and a good many servants with carpets\r\nfor us to sit on, and a teapot. We sat there for about two hours doing\r\nnothing but look at the green, an occupation for which this house is\r\nexpressly built. A gun announced the arrival of the men of Al Jabber, and\r\nthe sultan sent a man to kill a goat and receive them.\r\n\r\nOur great joy at their coming was nothing compared to our extreme\r\nsatisfaction at parting with them later on.\r\n\r\nI cannot say much for my skill as a physiognomist, for I have it recorded\r\nthat I liked the looks of our Mokadam (that is chief of our _kafila_, or\r\nleader) Talib-bin-Abdullah, son of the Jabberi sheikh, and that I did not\r\ncare for the looks of our new groom, Salem. I was quite wrong in both\r\ncases. There were also Saleh-bin-Yamani and another Jabberi. We were\r\ncertainly, this time, to start next day, but with another change in our\r\nroute, I believe on account of water. Instead of going by Al Gran, we\r\nwere to go by Wadi Manwab, retracing our steps as far as Furhud.\r\n\r\nVery early in the morning Imam Sharif came to us and told us that the\r\nJabberi had not sufficient camels with them and that we must take camels\r\nof Mandob the first day or two, and that others would meet us in the Wadi\r\nbin Ali, so there was little hope of a move that day. The Jabberi\r\nafterwards said the Mandob way was much the longest, so we changed again.\r\n\r\nWe delayed several days longer at Al Koton, hoping against hope that the\r\nsultan of Terim would grant us permission to pass through his\r\nterritories, that we might prosecute our journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFAREWELL TO THE SULTAN OF SHIBAHM\r\n\r\n\r\nOur departure from Al Koton on February 12 was almost as serious an\r\naffair as our start from Makalla. Sultan Salàh, with the instincts of\r\ntrue hospitality, not only refused to receive remuneration for our\r\nentertainment, but loaded us with presents of food for the way and fodder\r\nfor our animals, intimating that 'bakshish' to some of his dependents\r\nwould not be altogether unacceptable. With the object of receiving\r\nrewards for their services, the grand viziers, the mounshi (a scribe),\r\nthe hall-porter, the water-carriers, the slaves who had waited on us,\r\nwere all brought in a bare-faced manner to our room; as we descended the\r\nstairs, expectant menials lined the passages; we had to remember the\r\ngrooms, the soldiers, and the gardeners. Never again will the irksome\r\ncustom of tipping be half so appalling as when we left the palace of\r\nSultan Salàh.\r\n\r\nThe sultan wished to fire off seven guns at our departure, but this we\r\ndeclined. He came about a mile with us, and then went to Shibahm, to send\r\nan answer to the letter from the Tamimi, saying, 'On their eyes they\r\nwould meet us at Sa'ah.' He also determined to stay away a few days, as\r\nhe should find his house very dull when we were gone. It had been such a\r\ngreat break in the monotony of his life having us, and he had so much\r\nenjoyed the society of Imam Sharif that he was always promising him\r\nhouses, wells, lands, slaves, and wives if he would only return and\r\nsettle down in the Wadi Hadhramout.\r\n\r\nAn old and confidential relation of his was to accompany us all the way,\r\nand the Wazir Salim-bin-Ali came as far as our first camp, two hours off,\r\nin the Wadi Hadira. Here we could plainly see the formation of these\r\nvalleys, abrupt at the end and like a circus, not made by streams\r\ndescending, but like creeks and bays of a gigantic fiord. There is not\r\nmuch cultivation in the little valley. This is the road to Sheher. There\r\nare two approaches to the akaba, one by the Wadi Hadira and one by the\r\nWadi bin Ali, which is the way to Sheher. We had to enter the Wadi bin\r\nAli sideways by climbing over the akaba from Wadi Hadira, owing to the\r\nopposition of the Kattiri, who hold the mouth of Wadi bin Ali. The wazir\r\ndeparted in the morning with a Martini-Henry rifle which my husband sent\r\nto the sultan. This gave rise to the report which we heard afterwards\r\n'that we were distributing arms, of which we had five hundred\r\ncamel-loads.'\r\n\r\nThat day we had a very tiresome adventure. Starting off early before our\r\ncaravan with several Jabberi, we intended to ascend to the plateau before\r\nthe heat of midday came on. We were accompanied by a few soldiers, who it\r\nturned out did not know the way, and having ridden for an hour and a half\r\nup a narrow gorge with wild figs, wild date, and fan palms growing around\r\nus, and really magnificent cliffs 700 to 800 feet high on either side of\r\nus, reddish in colour and with fossils in the limestone strata, a truly\r\nfearful and awe-inspiring place, we suddenly came to an abrupt\r\ntermination of our valley, having wormed ourselves along, chiefly on\r\nfoot, and found that unless Sindbad's roc came to our assistance we could\r\nnot possibly get out of it. Consequently we were regretfully obliged\r\nretrace our steps, having spent three hours and much toil, but glad of\r\nhaving had an opportunity of following one of these valleys to its\r\nbitter end. It appeared that our supposed guides had never been there in\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\nWe scrambled down this wadi, and into the wadi to our right; the way\r\ntruly was difficult, the valley narrowing and nearly blocked up by\r\nperfectly perpendicular cliffs. Our caravan and servants were anxiously\r\nawaiting us at a curious spot called Mikadèh, about a quarter of the way\r\nup the cliff, where the road which we had missed goes through a natural\r\ntunnel about twenty yards long, from lovely pools of rain-water preserved\r\nin its recesses, with which we eagerly refreshed ourselves. The rest of\r\nthe ascent to the plateau was marvellously steep. The camels had to be\r\nunloaded, and two fell down. All the baggage was carried by men, up crag\r\nafter crag, and sometimes there was no sign of a path. I never could have\r\nimagined it possible for camels to ascend the roof-like slope of rock up\r\nwhich they had to clamber for the last 50 yards, and indeed, one poor\r\nanimal did fall, and injured itself so that it had to be unloaded and\r\ntaken back, whereupon those Bedouin who did not own it heartlessly\r\nregretted that it had not been killed, as they would have liked some of\r\nits flesh for supper. Just at the end everything had to be unloaded\r\nagain, and the camels literally dragged up to the top, while we sat\r\ndangling our legs over the cliff. Such yelling and shrieking I never\r\nheard among the Bedouin, our soldiers and our servants all calling each\r\nother rascals, and no one doing more than he could help; and inasmuch as\r\nwe had about five Salehs, four Umbarreks, and other duplicated names\r\namongst our men, the shouts of 'So-and-so, son of so-and-so,' made us\r\nfully realise the clumsiness of Arab nomenclature.\r\n\r\nWhen we clambered up on to the akaba it looked dreary and lifeless,\r\nsilent and lonely and stony, but it soon became lively enough, for we\r\nwere a large _kafila_, about fifty people and twenty-four camels. We had\r\nby very good fortune a great deal of cloud that day, but also some\r\ntremendous sun.\r\n\r\nWe sat eagerly counting the camels as they came into view, and had great\r\nanxiety about eight of them, and were obliged to send two soldiers back\r\nto search for them. We meant to proceed farther as water was two hours\r\non, and some of the first-arrived camels were reloaded; but, after all,\r\nwe felt we must wait for those eight camels, and send back to Mikadèh for\r\nwater. We could not encamp very comfortably, for the camel which had\r\nfallen and hurt his chest had our bedding and night-clothes and Imam\r\nSharif's tent-poles, and besides this our kitchen-box was missing and we\r\nhad had no luncheon. So another camel was sent down to fetch those\r\nnecessaries.\r\n\r\nIt was dreadfully windy, much dust blowing, and so stony that we could\r\nonly have a peg in each corner of our tents. Rain was threatening, so the\r\nbaggage was all stacked under the outer fly of our tent. The soldiers\r\nbehaved most helpfully and the brave and bold Jabberi had not yet once\r\nmentioned bakshish in our hearing and were most polite. They were\r\nbetter-looking men than others we had seen, all tall, slight, wiry, and\r\nvery muscular, a higher type than the Khailiki and much more dressed. The\r\nthree principal ones wore turbans, red and yellow. They said they were so\r\nvery sorry for losing the way that 'none of them felt quite well when\r\nthey thought of our inconvenience.'\r\n\r\nI could not sleep that night, so I got up and put on my dressing-gown and\r\nsat near the door with my head out, and so was fortunately ready to slip\r\nout when I heard a trailing picket, and found Zubda rushing up and down,\r\nlooking for water I suppose. We were so short of it that we had washed in\r\na very little without soap, and one horse had drunk that, and the other\r\nthe water the chickens were washed in. I caught him, but as I could not\r\npossibly drive in the picket, I tied him to a packing case, and then had\r\nto collect his food, which was blown all over the place, and take it\r\nthere for him.\r\n\r\nOn February 14, in consequence of the want of water, great was the hurry\r\nto start; we were off about half-past six, and travelled till one o'clock\r\nwithout stopping or getting water; the horses only had half a pint each,\r\nthat we had washed in. We should not have been so extravagant as to wash\r\nthat much if we had not wanted to let the horses drink.\r\n\r\nThe plateau here offered features that were new to us. It is as it were\r\nin two stories. From the bottom of a wadi you reach first a slope or\r\ntalus of loose stones, then a cliff, then another slope of loose stones\r\nand a cliff, and next comes the main akaba, and on this again a great\r\ndeal more of the upper story is left than we had hitherto seen. The upper\r\npart is from 80 to 100 feet above the lower; sometimes it is in the form\r\nof an isolated flat-topped hill, larger or smaller, and sometimes like a\r\nkind of centipede, and in the gullies between the legs of these\r\ncentipedes are to be found whatever remain of frankincense trees, for\r\nvegetation is very sparse on the akaba. Showered about everywhere are\r\nsmall bits of black basalt. We had several ups and downs, and passed\r\nwadis running in close to us before we began to descend by what must have\r\nbeen a fearful road for the camels, down the two precipices and the two\r\nflights of rolling stones, into the Wadi bin Ali. The way was far better\r\nthan that of the day before; the very Jabberi never saw such a road as\r\nthat, they said.\r\n\r\nWhen we started descending we saw the village of Bazahel below us--the\r\nJabberi capital. It has a picturesque modern fort, built on old\r\nHimyaritic foundations. When we reached it the soldiers fired guns, and\r\nwe were very kindly received by the inhabitants, who led us to a house\r\nthey had prepared for us. We excused ourselves from inhabiting it, saying\r\nit was better not to have our baggage carried up, but we would gladly\r\nrest in it.\r\n\r\nThe house seemed very clean--it was of mud of course; the walls of it and\r\nthe stairs had all been scraped into furrows and curves, and also the\r\ndados of the staircase and room were decorated with a kind of basket\r\npattern, and the floors were also in a raised pattern. Carpets were\r\nspread, water brought, and with great kindness they locked us in that we\r\nmight not be disturbed. Only our own party were in this room, the\r\nsoldiers in another. Matthaios had joined himself to the vanguard to see\r\nwhat happened to us, so my husband shared his horse with him; he had been\r\nterrified the day before at the fear that we had been carried off. The\r\nIndian servants and the botanist joined us just as coffee with ginger and\r\nother spices were brought. Our host had long wrestling with the lock\r\nbefore he could open the door, and after this we were desired to bolt it\r\non the inside. We had a pleasant camp, with palm-trees to shade each\r\ncooking fire, no starers being allowed. A woman here joined our _kafila_\r\nfor protection for a few stages. Even I never saw her face: she always\r\nwore her mask and her hat, and looked a most ungainly object. I dare say\r\nI looked the same to her. The sultan of Shibahm had sent a man on\r\nhorseback up that dreadful wadi to our last camp to thank us for the gun,\r\nand to warn us by all means to keep on the highlands for fear of the\r\nhostile Kattiri.\r\n\r\nAt Bazahel, Abdullah Mareh-bin-Talib-bin-Said, chief of the Jabberi,\r\nwelcomed us to his own house later in the day, a most unwonted piece of\r\nhospitality. He is much stained with indigo, a very elastic and naked\r\nsovereign, who bends his fingers back in a way horrible to behold when he\r\nwishes to emphasise his remarks, as he did when he spoke of the Kattiri\r\nand his wars with them, and his constantly losing men in raids, as is\r\nalso the case in his fights with the Hamoumi. As we sat around drinking\r\nhis coffee, he boasted of his direct descent from Jabber of Hiyal, the\r\nfriend and councillor of Mohammed, and told us that his family pedigree\r\nwas safely kept at Terim, with those of all the surrounding tribes of\r\nArabs. Somehow or other we did not care for the Jabberi at all\r\nafterwards, and for the rest of our journey to the coast our quarrels\r\nwith Talib, the son of Abdullah, and the difficulties he would throw in\r\nour way, were daily sources of annoyance to us.\r\n\r\nWe left Bazahel at half-past six next morning with the intention of\r\nclimbing up to the tableland again. The Wadi bin Ali is not very wide and\r\nthe ground is bare, though there are many villages scattered about. At\r\nrather a large one, where the wadi forks, and which we reached at eight\r\no'clock, we were to begin our ascent. To our dismay the camels were made\r\nto sit down and the camel-men said we must stay there the night, as there\r\nwas no water up above. We declared we knew there was, and that we would\r\ngo on; they must fill the twenty water-skins which we always carried.\r\nSome men were inclined to go on, but were overruled by the majority.\r\nAfter half an hour's contention we rode away with a good many people,\r\nleaving a few soldiers with the baggage, to show our determination to\r\nproceed, we being told that the others would be afraid to stay behind. We\r\nsat down once or twice in full view of the village, to survey the camels\r\nand wonder if they were coming, and much perplexed were we. We had\r\nexpected to change camels the following day, and this was the last day\r\nwith those men, who by delaying us wished to spin out another day's\r\njourney at twenty-five rupees. Those soldiers who were with us\r\nrecommended us to push on round a corner, where the wadi ran in, and\r\nconceal ourselves behind rocks, which there stood up between the path and\r\nthe village, that the camel-men might not think there was any hesitation\r\non our part; so men, and beasts, and I were carefully hidden, and one who\r\npeeped without his turban, reported that some camels were rising, and\r\nfinally, eight starting.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the tableland we had to go a long way round to avoid a\r\ngood many little wadis which were all quite steep, before we reached the\r\nwater. At the edge of the tableland are some little shelters used by\r\nhunters to shoot gazelle, which come down the gullies that to us\r\nappeared, inaccessible. Near the water the soldiers made us climb down to\r\nthe first story of a small wadi, where we sheltered under a shelf of rock\r\nwhich overhangs the whole end of it. When I was cool, I clambered up and\r\nfound a hollow or depression above our heads, with a few tufts of grass\r\nand some shrubs, so I took down some bits of shrubs as 'samples on appro'\r\nto the horses, and as they did approve, they were sent up to graze. We\r\nlay on our saddle-cloths till three, pretty hungry, when the eight camels\r\ncame, and a good long time after the others arrived also the relation of\r\nthe sultan Salàh joined us on a riding camel: an old man,\r\nSalem-bin-Mohammad by name. He said the camels had been changed, and the\r\nmoney paid in advance for this day, taken from those men. We had a cold,\r\nwindy night at this place, Farash. No one had tents but our own party;\r\neven the sultan and other gentry lie in the open on journeys. Our horses\r\nwere given a supper of dates, which are considered very strengthening,\r\nand which they much enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of Al Jabber possess the parallel Wadis Adim and Bin Ali, and\r\nthe road between them across the akaba is much traversed and apparently\r\nan ancient one. We went across on the level, eight miles, and then\r\ndescended by a narrow valley leading into the Wadi Adim. The way was made\r\nlonger by its having to wind about to skirt the wadis, which cut into it\r\nlike a fringe; sometimes we were only half a mile from our former or\r\nfuture track. Once we heard a gun fired, and looking across, we saw a\r\n_kafila_ of fifty camels, a much larger one than our own, slipping behind\r\na hill to hide from us, and presently some men climbed up to peep.\r\nWe--that is to say my husband, Imam Sharif, and I--with the three chief\r\nJabberi, the Relation, and some soldiers and others, all gathered up\r\ntogether and stood at gaze, without returning the gun-fire, which was\r\nmeant to find out if we had any bad intentions. Our own camels were very\r\nnear the strange _kafila_, and that party was terribly frightened. I\r\nthink the fright was mutual. When we had gone some distance, and were out\r\nof sight of the strange caravan, we were amused at seeing the soldiers\r\nand the Jabberi, all in line, running on at a double, firing guns, and\r\nshouting, 'Hohh! Hohh! Hohh!' My husband asked the Relation what chance\r\nwe had of being robbed, as this seemed a convenient place, but he\r\ncomfortingly said, 'We need not be much afraid, for we have the chief of\r\nthe robbers with us.' This was really true.\r\n\r\nThe place where we were to climb down into the Wadi Adim was tremendously\r\nsteep. It really seemed very like trying to climb down the sides of a\r\ntea-cup, I wondered how we and the camels and horses would ever do it.\r\nHowever we all did, and the valley became first a crack and then a little\r\nwider, and the road then was not so very bad in its own wild way. As soon\r\nas the valley became a little flat the men wanted to stop and wait for\r\nthe camels, but we said we would rather be in the village of Ghail Omr,\r\nwhich they said was only just round a near corner.\r\n\r\nSo we went on, but for fully two miles, till the Wadi Adim crossed our\r\npath. It was full of palms on the far side, so we went over there, but\r\nwere made, whether we would or no, to return to the mouth of our little\r\nwadi again; they said on account of food for the camels. There was a\r\nfearful row when we crossed the valley, to make us go back, there were\r\ndaggers out and loud shouts that my husband and I were rascals (harami)\r\nand Imam Sharif a dog, and Matthaios and the rest of the servants were in\r\ngreat alarm.\r\n\r\nWe were now in much anxiety and perplexity, for we were told the Tamimi\r\nhad not come, and they were to have been at Ghail Omr before us, to fetch\r\nus to Bir Borhut. We ourselves were not at the appointed place, for we\r\nwere kept pent into the little wadi. We were told that two men had been\r\nmurdered on the way to Sheher, but we never made out who they were; also\r\nthat a seyyid and a lot of the Amri tribe had come, so the Relation took\r\nmy horse and went off to investigate them.\r\n\r\nNext morning we thought it well to be ready and to look undismayed; the\r\nseyyid with the ten Amri joined us, and we all turned into the Wadi Adim\r\nto our right and south. The valley is most fruitful and well worth\r\nseeing; there are miles of palm woods; it is about 100 feet higher than\r\nWadi bin Ali, the slope is greater and the mountains lower; it is the\r\nmost frequented caravan route from Sheher to the Hadhramout. We passed\r\nplenty of people coming up, and one day we met a caravan of 150 camels\r\nfrom Sheher with Hadhrami merchants returning from India to enjoy the\r\nfruits of their rascality, and end their days on the sacred soil of\r\nArabia. There were little tents on the camels for women, and they seemed\r\nto us to have very few armed men.\r\n\r\nThe stream Ghail Omr is the first running one we saw since Al Ghail. It\r\ncomes from the small Wadi Loban and is very considerable. Wadi Adim is\r\nquite the gem of the valleys that we explored. There is a _ziaret_ or\r\nplace of pilgrimage, which attracts many people, to the tomb of a seyyid\r\nOmr, called after Omar, one of the four successors to Mohammed. The\r\nJabberi seem, in spite of possessing this rich valley, to be a poor\r\ntribe. There is a large population scattered in small homesteads. They\r\nhave slaves, who live in little huts made of palm branches, with the\r\ninterstices plastered with mud.\r\n\r\nTen more Jabberi joined us, so when we reached Sa'ah in two hours and a\r\nhalf, we were more than eighty people, with twenty-five camels, two\r\nhorses, and three donkeys. We dismounted in a dense crowd, in a field of\r\ndry earth cut up into squares with hard ridges, so our floors were most\r\nuncomfortable. Naturally we dared do no damage by having them dug smooth.\r\n\r\nOn our arrival at our camping ground and while we were waiting for our\r\ntents to be ready, always a weary, irksome time to the wayworn traveller,\r\nI was surrounded by women all masked. They seemed highly astonished at a\r\nsafety-pin I was taking out, so I gave, or rather offered it, to an old\r\nwoman near me. She wanted to take it, but several men rushed between us\r\nand roared at us both, and prevented my giving it to her. I stood there\r\nholding it out and she stretching out her hand, and one or two men then\r\nasked me for it for her, so I put it down on a stone and she took it away\r\nand seemed pleased, but a man soon brought it back to me on the end of a\r\nstick, saying 'they did not know these things and were afraid of them.'\r\n\r\nThere was no news of the Tamimi and many told us they would not come, but\r\nwe still kept up our vain hopes, as they had promised to come and wait a\r\nday or two for us, bringing with them a _siyara_ of the Minhali and of\r\nthe Hamoumi. However, we were never allowed to get to the trysting-place,\r\nas we afterwards thought, because the Jabberi wanted to keep the fleecing\r\nof us in their own hands.\r\n\r\nNot one of our party, with the exception of Imam Sharif, wished to go to\r\nBir Borhut, and they all encouraged each other in discouraging us.\r\n\r\nAbout a mile before reaching Sa'ah we saw an old fortress on a spur\r\njutting out of the precipice, with a cut road leading to it, so of course\r\nwe determined to visit it. We accordingly set out about two o'clock, my\r\nhusband and I, Saleh on the donkey, some soldiers, some of our _siyara_\r\nof Jabberi, and my camera. But we came to a standstill when first four,\r\nthen nine, and at last fourteen men were seen on the top of the ruins,\r\npointing guns at us. They said they would not let us advance without\r\npaying, and we feared to come to terms as our Jabberi first said they\r\nwere Amri, and then a tribe of Jabberi with whom they were at war. In\r\nthis uncertainty we had to turn back and my husband complained to the\r\nsheikh of Sa'ah, who said that this blackmailing had been planned by one\r\nof our three best Jabberi, Seid-bin-Iselem, who went with us, and that he\r\nwould send men of his own with us in the morning. In the morning they\r\ncame, sure enough, and first asked for a dollar 'to buy coffee,' but my\r\nhusband said 'No; he would give bakshish if he found writing, but if he\r\nfound no writing he would give nothing, and in any case, nothing till we\r\nreturned.' As we heard no more of them after they had retired to think\r\nover it, we were sure there could be no inscription. Besides we had seen\r\nthat the corner-stones were the only cut ones; the others were all rough.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we and Imam Sharif had another serious council, finding\r\nourselves in a regular fix.\r\n\r\nWe determined to stay on one more day at Sa'ah to give the Tamimi a\r\nchance to join us, for if we were baffled in getting from here to Bir\r\nBorhut, we must get to Sheher as quickly as possible and try from there\r\nto reach Bir Borhut. We wished to dismiss our camel-men, but they said\r\nthey would not let us do so, nor allow anyone else to take the loads.\r\nThey said they would take us for one rupee a day each camel, but we did\r\nnot know how many days they would take; they had also said that they\r\nwould stop where we pleased, or go on all day if we liked, but we had had\r\nexperience which led us to doubt this. They had now been asked to name\r\ntheir stages; _kafilas_ can go in seven or eight days.\r\n\r\nWe determined that our next attempt to go to Bir Borhut should be with\r\nfewer camels. It is a great mistake for explorers in dangerous countries\r\nto have collectors with them. They are a great drag and an extra anxiety.\r\nThe preparations they can make are necessarily all made by guesswork, as\r\nno one can tell what is to be found in an unknown country. If we had\r\nknown we should never have carried the huge spade and fork, which were\r\nhated all the way by everyone, or the quantities of cases of spirits of\r\nwine and receptacles for large animals, and the dozens of gins, snares,\r\nand traps of every description for things that we never found. Of course,\r\nin the case of our expedition, there are certain plants and reptiles\r\nwhich would not yet have emerged from their primeval obscurity, and it is\r\na great consolation to feel that something was accomplished in that way.\r\nFor everyone who is added to such an expedition, the leader has one more\r\nfor whose life and health he feels a responsibility, one more whose\r\nlittle idiosyncrasies must be studied by all the rest, and who may\r\nendanger the safety of all by his indiscretions with regard to the\r\nnatives, and one more who must be made to pack and be ready in time, or\r\nwilling not to stray away in times of danger. Mere servants do not so\r\nmuch matter, as they are under control, though the fewer of them the\r\nbetter, as they are human beings who must be fed and carried; but those\r\nabove them, and who, though not entitled to a seat in the council, feel\r\nfree to make comments, are the hardest to deal with.\r\n\r\nBefore we went to bed that night, Haidar Aboul, the second interpreter,\r\ncame and swore on the Koran that the Relation had promised the camel-men\r\ntwo rupees each; still we lay down happy in the assurance that we should\r\nbe at Sheher in seven days, but after a night much disturbed by guns for\r\na wedding, the first news that greeted us was that those camel-men wished\r\nto leave us. They were told that they could not do so: they were bound to\r\ntake us to Sheher. They then said they would not go in seven days--who\r\nhad arranged such long stages? They were told their sheikh had. Then we\r\nagreed to go in eight days, hoping that in the end they, finding they\r\nwould lose no money, would allow us to gain time. Some hours after the\r\nlittle crooked sheikh sent to say that if those men would not take us in\r\nseven days he would get others.\r\n\r\nThe Relation was not of much good to us. There is here no law, order,\r\nauthority, honour, honesty, or hospitality, and as to the people, I can\r\nonly describe them as hateful and hating one another. It must be an awful\r\nlife to live for ever unable to stir without _siyara_ even a few miles.\r\nThe rude Carinthian Boor cannot have been as bad as these Arabians.\r\n\r\nAfter this they came and said we should go in thirteen days. Later the\r\nsheikh sent to say he would send twenty soldiers, and make them take us\r\nin eight days. This my husband declined, as we knew he had no power, even\r\nin his own village.\r\n\r\nThen the brother of the sheikh came to ask for a present for him, which\r\nwas refused, and the sheikh said afterwards we could not trust that\r\nbrother, he was a liar.\r\n\r\nAt last another list of different stages was brought, and they swore by\r\nGod and upon the Koran that they would take us in seven days.\r\n\r\nAll the time we were in Sa'ah we had to remain in our tent, tightly tied\r\nin, for if we did not we were quite deprived of air by the crowd, which\r\nbecame thicker and thicker, driving the foremost nearly into the tent\r\nheadlong. I sewed strings to the extreme edges of our doors, which\r\nlapped half a yard, and this extension of size was very welcome. We\r\nafterwards found these strings useful and pleasant, but we always called\r\nthem the 'Jabberi strings' in remembrance of these tormentors. If,\r\nthinking the crowd had dispersed, we ventured to open the tent, a scout\r\nproclaimed the fact, and we were again mobbed.\r\n\r\nOur tent was 7 feet 6 inches square, and we found this quite large enough\r\nwhen it had to be pitched on a slope, or on a narrow, rocky ledge, when\r\ntrees had to be cut down to make room in a forest, or when it was among\r\nthe boulders of a river bed. Imam Sharif's tent was larger, and though it\r\nlooked more stately in a plain, he sometimes had not room to pitch it,\r\nand had to sleep with his servants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHARASSED BY OUR GUIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe never could ascertain whether the Tamimi had come or not, so on\r\nFebruary 18, having given up all hope of joining them and changed ten\r\ncamels, we set out, but not before nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nAfter Sa'ah the Wadi Adim becomes narrow, stony, and uninteresting, and\r\nour way lay for a good part along a stony river bed, gradually mounting,\r\nbut almost imperceptibly. For several days we pursued the course of this\r\nvalley, and had we known what would befall us as we approached the head\r\nof the Wadi Adim, I think nothing would have induced us to take this\r\nroute. It appears that a very wicked branch of the Hamoumi tribe hold a\r\nportion of this valley, and determined that their enemies, the Jabberi,\r\nwho stole their cattle and plundered their caravans, should not have the\r\nexclusive patronage of the lucrative English travellers on their way to\r\nthe coast. To our surprise at twelve o'clock we stopped at a well, Bir al\r\nGhuz, when our men began to unload the camels. They said they were only\r\njust waiting for the Hamoumi siyara to come up, and that they had already\r\narrived at Sa'ah.\r\n\r\nThe Hamoumi are a small, poor tribe of Bedouin, who occupy the lower end\r\nof Wadi Adim. They hire out camels to caravans, and do a great deal of\r\nthe carrying business. Their villages consist of miserable little hovels\r\ngathered round forts, placed at intervals down the valleys, so that they\r\ncan see from one to another. They have many flocks and herds, for there\r\nis actually pasturage for them, and many of the shepherds live in caves,\r\nthere being plenty in the sides of the valley, which are composed of\r\npudding-stone; they wall up the front.\r\n\r\nWe considered that, as Talib-bin-Abdullah, the chief of the Jabberi and\r\nso notorious a robber, was our Mokadam, we had better keep friends with\r\nhim, therefore we spoke him fair. He and his companions came and wrote\r\ntheir names after a list of stages, and made a most solemn oath they\r\nwould do anything we liked; and after we had sat for an hour or more in\r\nthe sun, waiting for the Hamoumi, they said we must pass the night at Bir\r\nal Ghuz, still swearing to the seven days.\r\n\r\nWe therefore encamped, and very soon the Jabberi came and asked my\r\nhusband for a sheep, but he said he would not give one now, but later in\r\nthe journey he would do so if he found we were getting on well; so they\r\nwent away, but soon came back for twenty-seven dollars, as _siyar_ to the\r\nHamoumi. My husband said he had agreed for twenty-five, but they said\r\nthey had spent two dollars on a messenger to fetch the Hamoumi. The\r\nJabberi were by way of having 110 dollars for their _siyar_, forty first\r\nand the rest at Sheher. They would not move next morning (the 20th)\r\nwithout the whole of the money, so they had to be given that and the\r\ntwenty-seven dollars for the Hamoumi. Besides this they always demanded\r\ntheir camel-hire every evening.\r\n\r\nThey next said the way was very dangerous, and we must take men from five\r\nother tribes (though we could not imagine how so many could be\r\naccommodated in that wilderness), and pay twenty dollars. As my husband\r\nrefused, and asked them to reflect upon the consequences of their\r\nconduct, the soldiers came and now said they recommended him to pay and\r\nrecover the money at Sheher; otherwise they, the soldiers, said they\r\nwould give up their weapons to the Jabberi as a pledge that they would\r\npay forty dollars at Sheher. We said they might, but Talib told us that\r\nif we did not pay they would give the Hamoumi their money and all go back\r\nthemselves. We then summoned Imam Sharif and had another council of\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nThe servants, meanwhile, used often to be leaning in at the tent door,\r\nscanning our faces and begging us to do anything the Jabberi wanted, and\r\nmoaning that we should never see the ocean any more.\r\n\r\nThe Jabberi had gone away, as my husband said he must think over this; so\r\nwe consulted together. We at first quite decided to return to Al Koton,\r\nand try to reach the coast by Wadi al Ain and, if we could not have the\r\ncamels, to load our own three animals with necessaries and money, leaving\r\nall else behind, and perhaps to slip by Siwoun in the night. So Talib was\r\nrecalled, and told that we would go back; that we were now convinced of\r\nthe dangers of this road, as we saw he was afraid himself, and as he had\r\ntold us of two places where murders were always committed. But afterwards\r\nwe thought it wiser to consent to pay the extra thirty dollars (in all\r\nfifty-seven) as _siyar_ to the Hamoumi, all the tribes mentioned being\r\nvarieties of Hamoumi. The money was to be placed on the Koran and taken\r\nthence by Talib, with an oath that, if the sultan of Sheher thought it\r\nunnecessary, it should be refunded. Seid-bin-Iselem and three soldiers\r\nwitnessed this, but Talib would not allow the Hamoumi to be present.\r\nInstead of taking Talib's gun as a deposit, the soldiers were to keep the\r\nmoney in their hands. We were still to be at Sheher within the seven\r\ndays, and not now to wait two or three days for the five tribes.\r\n\r\nThough we did unpack a Koran and make Talib-bin-Abdullah swear on it, we\r\ndid not then understand that merely swearing on the binding is nothing.\r\nThe Koran must be opened, and some places are better than others. Oaths\r\nby the life of a son, or to divorce a favourite wife, are really good. We\r\nbeing, as I say, ignorant, the oaths were broken.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I now felt quite conquered; and it must be admitted we had\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nWe had a horrible evening of dust-storms and hurricanes, and were\r\ndreadfully afraid of the tent being blown down. In the morning we packed,\r\nand the baggage was taken out to be tied in bundles, when Talib demanded\r\nthe eleven dollars camel-hire for the day before. In vain was he told\r\nthat all was packed, and he should have them at the next stage. No! he\r\nwould not go away without his money; so at great inconvenience we had to\r\npay on the nail.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone an hour before we stopped, unloaded, and changed our\r\ncamels for Hamoumi camels. 'Now all is peace,' said Talib-bin-Abdullah,\r\nand in the same breath asked for two dollars for two extra camels, that\r\nwe had had before we reached Sa'ah. My husband refused, but when we\r\nreached our stage Talib asked for that day's pay, and would not take it\r\nwithout the two dollars. Of course my husband refused again, saying we\r\nwere not responsible for those two camels; that Talib had contracted to\r\ntake us and our baggage, and that now we had twenty-two camels instead of\r\nthe fifteen with which we arrived at Al Koton. Equally, of course, he\r\nknew he must pay, and did.\r\n\r\nWe settled ourselves under some thorny trees at Bir bin Aboudan, where\r\nthere are two wells with good water. It is larger than most Hamoumi\r\nvillages, and has palm-trees and many large b'dom-trees.\r\n\r\nBesides the Hamoumi, Jabberi, and Yafei, there are many small subsidiary\r\ntribes, or rather families, forming little independent communities of\r\ntheir own, in this region.\r\n\r\nTo continue the life of Talib-bin-Abdullah. As soon as he had received\r\nthe last-mentioned money, he and his companions and the Hamoumi had a\r\ngreat and loud quarrel. Our money, being so bulky, was in bags scattered\r\nabout among all the baggage, but we always had one store-bag in my box,\r\nand my husband had some for current expenses. The camel-men thought all\r\nthe money was in a certain bag that was solemnly carried into the tent\r\nevery night. While they shouted we filled the bag with a certain amount\r\nof dollars, meant to represent our entire fortune, and placed it on the\r\ntable. We had become great hypocrites, but now we both decided that sweet\r\nwords were of no avail. Whenever Imam Sharif was sent for, the servants\r\ncrowded round, scanning our faces, and in despair themselves, saying 'our\r\nlives are sacrificed,' and making great lamentations about their wives\r\nand families.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard sometimes to keep our voices and countenances cheerful\r\nwhile holding counsel with Imam Sharif as to how we ought to act, for\r\nsometimes it is right to haggle over fourpence and sometimes it is right\r\nto pay through the nose. It is difficult, indeed, when you are cudgelling\r\nyour brains, not to knit your brows, even if you only wish to decide if\r\nyou will take your umbrella or not.\r\n\r\nTalib had not been absent from us an hour when he again arrived, saying\r\nhe wanted four dollars to pay a debt he owed in Bir bin Aboudan; 'it was\r\nto come out of the thirty dollars still owing for the _siyara_, and to be\r\npaid at Sheher,' he said. He was, of course, told that the money for the\r\n_siyara_ had been fully paid up, seventy dollars before the sultan of\r\nShibahm, and forty at Sa'ah. Talib bawled a good deal, and my husband\r\npointed to the money-bag and said, 'If you want all my money, take it;\r\nbut call it by no other name than robbery. Take all at once instead of\r\nbothering me perpetually, and I will settle with you at Sheher.'\r\n\r\nWhen they heard this they were frightened, and went away, saying 'Oh! No!\r\nNo! We do not want that.' They were soon back, and said they wanted four\r\ndollars on their food money (four annas a day), 'but not at all unless we\r\nwished.' They then acknowledged, before the soldiers, that the _siyar_\r\nwas fully paid up, and that Talib had made a mistake about those two\r\ndollars that he had obtained for the camels. In the meantime we had been\r\nplanning to get our most urgently needed things ready to load on the\r\nhorses and to walk to Sheher, only sixty-five miles--but such miles!\r\nHowever, we knew our enemies had the advantage of knowing the way and the\r\nwater-places, which we did not, and could climb like monkeys over places\r\nwhere we could not take horses.\r\n\r\nI am sure we should never have found the way over such mountains, where\r\ncamels sat down and slid, and we did much the same, sometimes quite\r\ninvoluntarily.\r\n\r\nSaleh at this time seemed disposed to do his duty. The money (thirty\r\ndollars) that had been extorted the day before for _siyar_ to the\r\nHamoumi, who had not yet turned up, and given to the soldiers, was by\r\nthem put into Saleh's keeping, as he had a box that could be locked. In\r\nthe night Talib came to Saleh and said: 'Six Hamoumi are here; give me\r\nthe money for them.' 'Wait till morning,' said Saleh, 'and I will give it\r\nyou before Mr. Bent, Imam Sharif, and everybody,' but when he offered it\r\nto him then, he said, 'No, keep it.'\r\n\r\nWe had gone a little ahead next morning, February 21, Talib, Imam Sharif,\r\nand I, with the needful escort, my husband having to ride a camel as his\r\nhorse's back was sore, and had proceeded an hour on our road\r\nwhen--'Bang!' went a gun high up in the rocks, to our left, near the\r\nvillage of Kouna or Koutna, and 'bang!' went another; so we stopped, and\r\nwith some hesitation five of the soldiers and some of the Jabberi went\r\nforward, getting round behind the shelter of some trees. There were seven\r\nmen up in the rocks, and a tower in the village was crowded. They\r\nconstantly fired from both places. The camels soon came up, and we all\r\ndismounted and stood together with our animals, Basha, Zubda, and Mahsoud\r\nclose by. This shooting and parleying went on for half an hour. We\r\nthought at first that they would only fire over our heads, but a bullet\r\nstruck the ground very near us.\r\n\r\nWe could not make out what it was all about. There were so many different\r\nsuggestions made as to the cause; some said the people of the village\r\nwanted to come with us as _siyara_, and some that they wanted to fight\r\nthe Hamoumi, who had lately taken their camels.\r\n\r\nOur men shouted, '_Siyara! Siyara!_' and the men on the tower, 'Come no\r\nnearer!' 'By my God you shall not come on!' 'We are fighting and we will\r\nslay him who dares to stir a step!'\r\n\r\nTalib said, 'Now we can go neither backward nor forward,' and amazed us\r\nby asking for no money.\r\n\r\nAt last the soldiers came back from the village and told us to advance,\r\nso we mounted and rode through the village amidst uncomplimentary remarks\r\nfrom the scowling inhabitants. We were told some people had gone on to\r\nintercept us, and accordingly about half a mile farther there were more\r\nshots, this time to our right. We of course came to a standstill, but\r\nTalib, in spite of the shooting, rushed at Mahsoud's bridle and dragged\r\nImam Sharif down into the river bed, calling excitedly to the rest of us\r\nto hurry on. We passed safely, and you may be sure looked in every rock\r\nand bush for enemies.\r\n\r\nHardly a quarter of a mile on, and where the valley is about three\r\nhundred yards wide, there was a small tower to our left, and we saw a lot\r\nof men rushing into this and appearing on the battlements. We knew they\r\nwould shoot at us and I was watching for the puff. The first shot threw\r\nup the earth nearly two yards from my horse's nose, and the next seemed\r\nto say 'tshish!' just at the back of my neck. It went just between my\r\nhusband and Imam Sharif, who were on foot behind me.\r\n\r\nEveryone ran as fast as the rocky ground let them, to some trees out of\r\nsight of that tower, but not knowing whether we were not going to meet\r\nwith more shooters, we always had our revolvers ready, though no one knew\r\nthat; our safety lay in being unarmed in the enemies' eyes; we kept them\r\nfor worse need.\r\n\r\nThe sheikh of Kouna said his name was Abdullah-bal-Jabbeli, of the tribe\r\nof Obathani. There are two other small tribes, Zedin--Sheikh Ebenadon,\r\nand Shibim--Sheikh Bengadem.\r\n\r\nAfter that last firing there was no more that day, and we slept\r\npeacefully at Naïda, which we reached about 12.30, and where the\r\ninhabitants were quite friendly, bringing us all the food we asked to\r\nbuy. The valley seemed to come quite to an end, but took a sudden turn\r\neastward just before we reached the village. It is rather a pretty place,\r\nbut the spot on which we were encamped was dreadfully dirty, and we were\r\nso afflicted by dust-storms, that our books were covered while we read,\r\nand the colour of our clothes and bedding obliterated, and we had to tie\r\nour hair up in handkerchiefs to keep it clean.\r\n\r\nWe always had quilts of turkey-red or some other cotton, for when we lay\r\ndown our beds often became sandy, and the quilts could easily be shaken\r\nor brushed, and besides protected the blankets from burrs and\r\ngrass-thorns. We were by ourselves in the afternoon when Talib came quite\r\nalone, and with an air of secrecy, to ask for his eleven dollars for that\r\nday's camel hire. I rushed out to the kitchen and brought Matthaios as a\r\nwitness. Then Talib asked for two dollars, and when my husband began to\r\ncall Saleh, he said he did not want them and went away. He was soon back\r\nagain, however, with Saleh, to ask if my husband wished to pay any more\r\nfor _siyara_ of the people we were coming to. My husband said 'No,' and\r\nafter some talk Talib said he would not ask it if my husband did not\r\nwish. I told Talib that the very next thing he would get would be my\r\nhusband's money-bag, so he retired. Later he came for thirty dollars to\r\nsend to some people that night, but my husband told him to send his own\r\nmen for them, and not afterwards to say he had paid a messenger; the\r\nmoney would only be paid into those people's own hands. We lay down with\r\nno great certainty of peace for the morrow, when we expected to reach\r\nGhaida.\r\n\r\nAll, however, went quietly that day, much to our relief. My husband had\r\nbeen induced to pay a rupee to send a scout up the mountain to look\r\nbehind rocks and bushes for dangers, but we passed on our way completely\r\nunmolested by the shepherdesses, young and old, who were all we met with\r\nin the shape of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe valley became narrower, we rose higher, and the cliffs were\r\ncavernous. Sometimes the valley seemed quite to finish up, but then it\r\nalways took a turn again. Much of the way was over large, round stones,\r\nmost horrible for the horses.\r\n\r\nWe passed a water-place two hours after we left Naïda, though Talib had\r\nmade us stop there because, he said, there was no water within a day's\r\njourney, and we found ourselves stopped at Rahba, two hours at least\r\nbefore Ghaida, where we expected to be, Talib still sticking to it that\r\nwe should be at Sheher in three more days. He only asked for four annas\r\nfor coffee to drink at the great tomb of a wali, Sheikh\r\nSalem-bin-Abdullah Mollah el Mohagher, who is buried near a mosque and a\r\ntank, the footbath of cattle, from which we drank pea-green water, boiled\r\nand filtered of course. Altogether Rahba is a pretty village, but much\r\nexposed to wind. The tribes thereabout are Mahri, Gohi, and Salbani.\r\n\r\nFebruary the 23rd was a weary day. Talib had asked leave to go to Sufeila\r\nto arrange something with the sheikh, soon after our arrival at Rahba,\r\nsaying he would not be away long. He did not go all day, but at night\r\nsaid he was now going, and would take sixty rupees _siyar_ then, but was\r\ntold we would take it ourselves. In the morning the Hamoumi refused to\r\nload up, saying they had not been paid the twenty-seven dollars. Talib\r\nwas absent, but being fetched said he was keeping the money, as otherwise\r\nthe Hamoumi might leave us anywhere they liked. In the meantime the\r\nsoldiers, according to their habit, instead of keeping their weapons for\r\nour safeguard, once more gave up their swords and guns to the Hamoumi.\r\nThey always were pledging them to our enemies, as an earnest that we\r\nwould do what they wanted.\r\n\r\nThe Hamoumi loaded the camels, on the oath of Talib that they should have\r\nthe money that night at Sufeila, a place that we were to pass, and which\r\nthe day before we were told it was impossible to reach in one stage. They\r\nswore to take us to Bir Baokban. We started about ten o'clock, and at\r\neleven the camels were stopped at Sufeila, and the men said they would\r\nwait a quarter of an hour, to which my husband consented. They then began\r\nto lead the camels away to feed, so my husband stoutly said that if they\r\ndid that he would get other camels. Neither he nor any of us knew how or\r\nwhence these other camels could be procured, but it had the desired\r\neffect, and they left the camels sitting among their loads. Saleh was\r\nsent to arrange with the wretched little sheikh, and remained away till\r\nafter two o'clock. A soldier was sent to fetch him, and then arose a\r\ntremendous uproar. First they said we should stay where we were, then\r\nthat we should go only a short distance, and on a different way to that\r\nalready settled. After that we were told we could not go to Al Figra or\r\nAl Madi, as these were recognised places for murders, and we were told\r\nthe same of Ghail Babwazir; also a good many different numbers of days\r\nwere mentioned for our journey.\r\n\r\nMy husband said he would camp at Sufeila, but they quickly loaded up for\r\nBir Baokban, they said. The sheikh was given fifteen dollars, and he told\r\nus he would send four of his sons with us.\r\n\r\nI must say that after those four or five hours of being stared at and\r\ncalled bad names, I was pretty tired. We none of us remarked that three\r\nof the soldiers, all the Jabberi, and the four sons stayed behind.\r\n\r\nI was riding with Imam Sharif, two Indians, four soldiers, and the groom\r\nleading Zubda, whose back was still sore, when we came to a fork in the\r\nway. The soldiers asked a passing man, 'Which is the way to Ghail?' The\r\nman looked puzzled; so were we. I said, 'We want to know the way to Bir\r\nBaokban.' 'No, no! Ghail,' said the soldiers, and when I said 'Baokban!'\r\nagain they laughed scornfully. Our _kafila_ came up, and I rode to my\r\nhusband and told him I was sure we were being led out of our way.\r\n\r\nWe were guided down a rocky slope into a valley not more than 200 feet\r\nwide, with thick woods up each side, and a sandy bottom. Here we were\r\nstopped by a good many shots from each side, and retreated a little,\r\nwithout turning our backs, and then looked about for the four sons. There\r\nwas another row of course, and my husband said we would return to\r\nSufeila; but we were told at last that we might pass, so we did, and one\r\nof the shooters soon joined us and asked for a rupee for coffee, but was\r\nrefused, and then said he would let us go to Bir Baokban if he got a\r\nrupee, but he did not insist. We now thought it well to ask where we\r\nwere, and were told that it was Hadbeh, a place we had never heard of\r\nbefore. My husband said we should return to Sufeila, and carried off a\r\nstring of camels. There was a great consultation, amid much roaring and\r\nshouting. I rode fast to the head of the _kafila_ to see what was\r\nhappening, my husband still going back with about six camels, the others\r\ngoing on, they said, to Bir Baokban. I then galloped back over the stones\r\nto the soldiers who were behind, and said, 'Your sultan has placed you\r\nunder our orders; go and get those camels back.' 'No, no,' they said, 'it\r\nis quite safe to go on,' and ran back as hard as they could.\r\n\r\nI then rode back quickly to my husband, and found him in abject distress;\r\none of his camels had shed its load, and was seated on the ground. The\r\nsoldiers remained behind, sitting on a bank. After a long council, we\r\ndetermined to go on to a village close by, where we joined the other\r\ncamels. We had barely time to set up the tents before dark, and our store\r\nof bread and charcoal stood us in good stead. The Indian party were\r\ndreadfully late getting to bed. Dismay reigned supreme amongst us all.\r\n\r\nSaleh came in to our tent and said, 'The man who shot at us says, \"You\r\ncannot go on to-morrow. To-day we only shot our bullets in the air, but\r\nto-morrow we shall shoot at you.\"'\r\n\r\nWe thought of going back to Sufeila, and sending to the sultan of Sheher\r\nfor help, but where could we find a messenger? When we were in bed, Saleh\r\ncame and said two men with the matches of their guns alight were standing\r\nby our tent; some of those that had shot at us, and said they wanted four\r\nor six annas, as they were returning to Sufeila. They refused to take\r\nfour then, so my husband said they had better come about it in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nMorning revealed that these were some of our own camel-men, who were\r\njust pretending to be the shooters in order to get money, and also we\r\nfound out that Talib had employed the shooters to give us the fright, in\r\norder to delay us, that the Jabberi and the soldiers might have a feast\r\nat our expense in the village, and time to eat it. They did not reach\r\ncamp till eleven.\r\n\r\nNext morning the soldiers brought my husband twelve of the fifteen\r\ndollars the sheikh had received (being part of the original thirty, said\r\nto be for the three other tribes of Hamoumi), saying that he was a very\r\nwicked man, as he had not sent his four sons, so they had only left him\r\nthree dollars for the feast. Hardly had my husband put this by, when\r\nTalib came and had to be given thirty-six dollars for _siyar_ to the\r\nMahri. Plainly we were in their hands, and had to pay whatever Talib\r\nchose, as we might be hemmed in at any moment. We felt as if we were in a\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nThe eleven dollars camel-hire which we had kept out having gone to make\r\nup this sum, and the camel-men refusing to load without it, we had to\r\nunpack again to get it for them.\r\n\r\nSufeila, where we had endured such a disagreeable delay, is on the\r\ntableland, 3,150 feet above the sea-level, with excellent air, excellent\r\nwater, palm and other trees, and would make a first-class sanatorium for\r\nAden. It is ten miles inland from Sheher as the crow flies.\r\n\r\nAbout 8 o'clock next morning we started, not knowing precisely whence or\r\nwhither, and determined to keep together as much as possible. We followed\r\nfor miles the bed of a stream, which collects all the water from this\r\npart of the akaba, and gradually develops into Wadi Adim, the great\r\napproach to the Hadhramout. There is a fortress on a hill 3,500 feet\r\nabove the sea-level, the highest point in this part; Haibel Gabrein being\r\n4,150 feet, and near Dizba the highest point is 4,900 feet. After some\r\nmiles on the akaba, we plunged into a valley about 200 feet wide, and\r\nwooded with palms; the earthen cliffs were about 60 feet high, and the\r\nbed sandy.\r\n\r\nBy this time we neither had a liking for valleys, cliffs, trees, nor\r\npeople. We did not feel pleased at being led straight across the valley\r\nto a band of armed men, in a most unpleasant situation for us if they\r\nmeant mischief. These were only Jabberi travelling, and they were told\r\nthat we were friends of the sultan of Sheher, and not going to stay a\r\nminute. I suppose they would have fired if we had not been introduced to\r\nthem. We were glad to reach Bir Baokban at 11.30. It is a well in a bare\r\nplace at the mouth of a valley. Talib did not wish to stay there, for the\r\nwater is brackish, and he wanted us to go on before the camel-men came\r\nup, but we waited, and they and the Jabberi had a loud and angry quarrel,\r\nand we were told there was no water nearer than Al Madi, and some of them\r\nwanted to stop at a place half-way to Al Madi and send for water. We\r\ncould make neither head nor tail of it. Talib then asked my husband which\r\nhe wished to do, for so it should be; but as he knew it was a case of\r\n'You may do as you like, but you must,' answered to that effect,\r\n'Whichever Talib liked, we were in his hands and could not choose.' After\r\ngreat hesitation we encamped in a windy, dusty, but rather pleasant place\r\nnear Bir Baokban.\r\n\r\nThere were many tombs on the way. One had three upright stones, which the\r\nHamoumi camel-men touched, and then kissed their fingers.\r\n\r\nThey cheerfully told us that many caravans have been robbed here, and men\r\nmurdered; pleasant news for us.\r\n\r\nWe asked them why we had been fired on, and they said that the people\r\nbelieved we poisoned the wells. The soldiers came and shouted at us a\r\ngood deal, saying, 'Why do you hire Bedouin to protect you? Are we not\r\nhere? Do you not trust us?' We soothed them with flattering words, and\r\nthen Talib came and extorted nine more dollars.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we had to pay three dollars to three men who said they had\r\nseen four men, which four men ran away. We were informed that we were to\r\npass through three tribes that day, and should have a good deal of\r\ntrouble on the way to Dizba, the place half way to Al Madi. As a matter\r\nof fact we were pretty sure that these later scares were only got up to\r\nfrighten more money out of our pockets. The soldiers were told to go in\r\nfront, but they often sat down and lit a fire for their water pipe, got\r\nbehind, or rode a camel.\r\n\r\nThough we went up and down a good deal, it was not too steep to ride all\r\nthe way, and though there were watchings and scoutings, we saw neither\r\nman nor beast, nor any habitation of the three tribes. As we went along\r\nmy husband was told that an old woman (whom we never saw) had come and\r\nsaid that the men of Al Madi would not let us pass, and that we must\r\nwrite to the sultan of Sheher to send us two hundred soldiers.\r\n\r\nThere is water at Dizba, though we were told there was none till Al Madi.\r\nWe encamped in a sheltered spot, a sort of pot between low hills. We\r\nought, according to the solemn contract, to have been at Sheher by that\r\ntime. We talked over the plan of sending to Sheher, and decided that\r\ndoing so meant much pay to the messenger, thirty or forty more dollars\r\n_siyar_, and, what was worst, four days' delay; it would also cost\r\nforty-four dollars in camel-hire; so we decided that it was far better to\r\npush on, for our delay would only give time to more enemies to gather\r\nround us. It would likewise be far cheaper, and so it subsequently turned\r\nout.\r\n\r\nFrom being hypocrites we now became liars, and my husband said he had not\r\nso much money left, and that he had already paid four rupees to send men\r\non the morrow. There was some talk of our all going by night and getting\r\npast Al Madi, but in that case our own men would only fire on us to\r\nfrighten us. Next we heard that there was no village at Al Madi where we\r\ncould buy forage; we had but little left, though plenty of dried bread.\r\nThen three Jabberi came and said they were getting lame, and wanted eight\r\ndollars to buy a donkey out of their food-money, but my husband said he\r\nhad paid so much for _siyara_ that he had not enough to pay that till we\r\nreached Sheher.\r\n\r\nThere was an idea that they would shoot round us in the night, for they\r\nspoke of the dangerous situation in which we were, and wanted six or\r\neight dollars to pay for scouts on the hills, but went away when my\r\nhusband said he would see about it in the morning. In case they did we\r\ndetermined to remain silent in our beds that they might be unable to\r\nlocate us, and in that case they would not fire at our tents for fear of\r\nhitting us.\r\n\r\nWe had a very cold night; the dew in the morning was streaming off our\r\ntent in heavy drops.\r\n\r\nTalib said, 'The people of Al Madi do not want money, but our lives and\r\nsouls.' We did not think they meant to kill us, but only to frighten\r\nmoney out of us. We also overheard some conversation about our lives and\r\nbaggage being in peril. We had not far to go, but the way was very\r\nintricate.\r\n\r\nAt sunset we three had a great council, and sent for Saleh; the soldiers,\r\nhaving been flattered, were fetched too, as we now thought we had them on\r\nour side, and we threatened to ruin them and their families, or to give\r\nthem good bakshish if they did well by us. My husband said we had decided\r\nthat in future he would not give another pi (not to eat, but there are a\r\ngood many pies in an anna and also pice), but that, as the camel-men\r\nspoke of stopping between Dizba and Al Madi, we would have some food\r\nready to eat on the journey and get the soldiers to force them on; and,\r\nif we had to stay, to load the horses and start the following morning to\r\nSheher. The soldiers agreed on promise of a good sheep next day; the\r\nHamoumi camel-men were promised coffee and sugar, so they agreed also.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all gone, Saleh, to our unbounded amazement, said that\r\nSeid and Talib had confided to him 114 rupees, on account of his having\r\nthe locked box; so he brought them to us, and amid shouts of laughter\r\nthey were engulfed in our bag.\r\n\r\nBy the bye, we actually had two of the Al Madi people with us, so we\r\nought to have been safe; or what is the good of _siyara_?\r\n\r\nIn the morning an awful object met our view. This was a soldier, a very\r\nugly black man, who was dragged along on his knees by his arms and\r\nshoulders to our tent. He had been struck by the cold, his companions\r\nsaid. He seemed to be perfectly helpless, and to have no control or use\r\nof any muscles save those which were at work making the most horrible\r\ngrimaces. I ran to the kitchen and fetched our tea, to the rage of\r\nMatthaios, who said he had no more water to replace it, and that as it\r\nwas we could not have a cupful each. It was poured down his throat in a\r\nvery rough way, but refused to stay. My husband gave him some of an\r\nunknown medicine, that he said was specially used for such cases, and\r\nthis brandy just trickled out of his mouth, so they dragged him away to\r\ntheir own fire, still in a kneeling position. They then opened his jacket\r\nand burnt him a good deal with a hot sword, and he was given tepid water\r\nto drink, which stayed down very well. When we were about to start, he\r\nwas held upright by two men. A thick square shawl was put rather\r\ncarelessly over his head with the fringe over his face, and pushed back\r\noff his shoulders, to allow his arms to come out through an _abba_, a\r\nkind of cloak with armholes, which was also put over his head. They came\r\nout so high up of course, that the hands stuck out on a level with his\r\nears. High up under his elbows, and far above his waist, a turban was\r\nwound, and a muffler was put round his neck and mouth; he hobbled along\r\nwith two supporters and leaning on a spear, with the shawl streaming on\r\nthe ground like a train--a very absurd sight. In about an hour he was\r\nquite well.\r\n\r\nTalib, not knowing of our little plan of going with the Hamoumi to Al\r\nMadi, came and told us how very dangerous Al Madi was, and that it would\r\nbe far better to go by Ghail Babwazir, if only the camel-drivers would\r\nagree. If they would not, he would put all our most necessary things,\r\n_i.e._ our money, on his own camel, and we would ride secretly off\r\ntogether. It is needless to say we did not consent, as it would have been\r\n'Good-bye Talib and money!'\r\n\r\nThen Ali, the chief of the camel-men, came and said he would not go\r\nunless he got six secret dollars for himself and six for the others, and\r\nsaid he would (like Ananias and Sapphira) swear he had only six. Imam\r\nSharif and Saleh again perjured themselves in our behalf to such an\r\nextent that my husband and I could hardly sit by, but we must speak the\r\nlanguage of the country, I suppose.\r\n\r\nFrom Dizba we passed over very high ground, 4,300 feet, with a cold\r\nrefreshing wind from the sea. It seemed to us a healthy climate. In a\r\nlittle narrow pass is a rude tomb near the rough stone cabin of a sainted\r\nlady called Sheikha, where our soldiers and camel-men made their\r\ndevotions.\r\n\r\nI had a very uncomfortable ride, for on the way we saw an aloe of a kind\r\nwe had not seen before, and which proved to be new enough to obtain the\r\nname of _Aloe Luntii_. The botanist sawed off the head of it (which is\r\ngrowing now in Kew Gardens), and we knew he dared not try to take it on\r\nhis camel, as the men always quarrelled over every weight that was added\r\nto the load; so I told him to go on and leave it, as if he did not care\r\nfor it, and then I tied it to the off-side of my saddle, and had to ride\r\nhanging heavily on my left stirrup, as otherwise I should have been\r\nover-balanced, and my horse would have got a sore back. On arrival, I\r\ndismounted in a quiet place, put the aloe down with my jacket thrown on\r\nit, and later fetched it into the tent, under cover of my feminine\r\ndraperies, and at night it was smuggled into some package. On one\r\noccasion, when no one had been riding for some days past, a felt\r\nsaddle-cloth somehow was left behind by us, so one of our own men was\r\nforced to carry it in his hand till I discovered it, and tied it to my\r\nsaddle, for he was not allowed to put it on a camel. I tell this to show\r\nhow very disobliging they were to us.\r\n\r\nMariala is the name of a disgusting pool or cistern of the very dirtiest\r\nwater, on a bare and lonely hillside, where we were exposed to wind and\r\ncold, and where we encamped in much the same state of perplexity as\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nSoon after our arrival my husband was asked for eight dollars to send\r\nfifteen men up the hills to look for murderers; he refused, then the\r\ncamel-men said they would not start without six men to go ahead, but that\r\nwas refused too.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started for Al Madi. We wound up and down, over bare\r\nground, and could see no danger for miles. At a point on the highland we\r\nwaited for the camels to come up; they came and passed to the southward\r\non a well-trodden path. Talib called out to them to stop, and said that\r\nhe would not go that way, and that we should not, and that the men were\r\ntaking us into danger. He pointed to the south-west, but we did not like\r\nparting from our baggage. Talib then asked my husband which way he\r\npleased to go.\r\n\r\n'Which is the best?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'I do not know,' said Talib.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said my husband, 'we will follow the camels.' On we all went\r\nin great doubt, and the Jabberi told us awful stories of the Hamoumi\r\nintentions. We had five armed Jabberi, seven soldiers, and twelve\r\nHamoumi, all armed, including two little boys.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, so brave the night before, said: 'We can do nothing--we are\r\nafraid. If we fired a gun, or if they fired, hundreds of people would\r\ncome, and they would kill us.'\r\n\r\nThey never either raised their weapons or their tongues in our defence.\r\nThey said the sultan of Sheher would not be able to go himself or send\r\nsoldiers into these parts, and that the Al Madi people wished to decoy us\r\nto Al Madi and kill us. The Jabberi said the same, and Talib again wished\r\nus to ride off with him.\r\n\r\nThe Hamoumi said it was all Talib's fault, for he owed a great deal of\r\nmoney at Al Madi, and was afraid of going thither.\r\n\r\nThe Hamoumi then said they would take us to Ghail Barbwazir or Barbazir\r\nor Babwazir, but we must keep it a secret from the Jabberi and the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nSaleh said to them, 'My dear friends, tell me the truth. Where are we\r\ngoing? I also am an Arab and a Moslem, and I swear by my Koran and my\r\nreligion, that we will give you forty dollars, and spend two days in\r\nGhail Babwazir, during which you will have your eleven dollars a day; and\r\nwe will engage you on to Sheher, and give you good bakshish, and a good\r\ncharacter to the sultan and two nice turbans.'\r\n\r\nWe gasped in amazement at this.\r\n\r\n'Oh!' said Saleh, 'I only read them something from the preface of the\r\nKoran! We are not bound at all. If I had to swear falsely on the Koran, I\r\nshould have to be given a great many guineas!\r\n\r\nWe never knew the name of the place where we slept that night.\r\n\r\nTalib came in the morning and said he could not persuade the Bedou\r\nHamoumi to go to Ghail Babwazir. We told him that they had agreed to do\r\nso, and he was very angry at our having settled anything without him.\r\nThen Ali said he could not go in two days; so he was led aside and\r\nprivily threatened with public betrayal as to having taken twelve dollars\r\nand saying he only had six. Then they all wanted payment in advance, but\r\nthe same threat to Ali availed to avert this bother and we set out, told\r\nthat we should go as far as Gambla.\r\n\r\nWe had, after, all, to part from the camels, which went a more roundabout\r\nway, while we climbed down 1,000 feet over very steep rocks, with the use\r\nof hands as well as feet, the horses being with us, to a place not very\r\nfar from water. The horses were sent to fetch a little, while we awaited\r\nthe camels more than half an hour, and ate some food we had with us.\r\n\r\nThe horses had been badly off and had only bread and dates, for the\r\ncamel-men would sell us no forage. When they arrived they said we must\r\nstay where we were, and there was a fierce row as usual. They also\r\ndemanded their eleven dollars, but gave up sooner than unload, as we said\r\nwe would not stop.\r\n\r\nAt one time, when we had been waiting a long while for the return of\r\nthose camels which had gone to fetch skins of water, Talib caused our\r\nhorses to be saddled, mounted his camel, and started, but my husband\r\nwould not go on to Gambla, when the camel-men had refused to go there.\r\nThen we all lay down on rough stones, scorching in the sun for hours,\r\nwondering what would happen and whether we could get any farther that\r\nday, but at length we suddenly were invited to start.\r\n\r\nWe had a very steep climb up on foot and then down, and pitched our tents\r\nfor the night in a very bare little hollow. We were very sorry for the\r\nhorses; it was sad to see them turning over the stones, and we longed for\r\nsome real horse food for them.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers sent a letter to Sheher to announce our arrival, and they\r\nwished to send for more soldiers, but we begged them not to do so, as\r\nthey were quite useless.\r\n\r\nSeid-bin-Iselem in this lonely spot came to Saleh and wanted some money\r\nto buy something, where there was no one to sell. Saleh said the money\r\nwas still in his box, and to make his words good smuggled it in again, in\r\na most clumsy but quite successful way.\r\n\r\nAli's secret had twice to be threatened, next morning, for different\r\nreasons before we could start, and then they all roared that they would\r\nnone of them carry our chairs. We all travelled on foot still, as there\r\nwas much climbing to do. We climbed down 2,000 feet, very steep in parts,\r\nto Gambla.\r\n\r\nGambla is a verdant and palmy place where we could buy so much food for\r\nour hungry horses that at length my Basha turned his back on his big\r\npile, and came with long green streamers hanging from his sated mouth to\r\ndoze beside me.\r\n\r\nThere was a struggle, of course, to stay the night at Gambla, and we were\r\ntold we could not reach Ghail Babwazir till very late, but we said we did\r\nnot care how late, and Ali was once more privately drawn aside, and again\r\nthreatened about the twelve dollars, so it was agreed we should go on.\r\n\r\nWe waited, however, a long time, and seeing no camels collected to load I\r\nsaid very loud, 'Call all the Hamoumi together here, and tell Ali that\r\nthe very last moment has come.'\r\n\r\nAli rushed about, and soon had us on our way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nRETRIBUTION FOR OUR FOES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reached Ghail Babwazir in three hours, at half-past five, passing\r\nthrough several oases. It is a large town. Some children, as I came round\r\na corner, cried, 'Let us flee! here is a demon' (_afrit_).\r\n\r\nAll the guns of our escort were fired, and we were ushered into a house,\r\nwhere there was a good-sized room with some matting.\r\n\r\nWe were all very tired, hot and hungry, but alas for Arab hospitality! No\r\ncoffee was brought, not even water, and when our servants asked for water\r\nand wood--'Show us first your money' was the answer they got.\r\n\r\nWe had a very public visit from the governor, who is called sultan, and\r\nwho asked us if we had had a pleasant journey, and wondered how we could\r\nhave been so many days on the road.\r\n\r\nHe was told of all our troubles, and took the Hamoumi, Mohammad, who shot\r\nat us, a prisoner, and his _jembia_ (or as they say in Southern Arabia\r\n_ghembia_), without which he is ashamed to be seen, was given into my\r\nhusband's custody.\r\n\r\nOur expedition all passed a peaceful night, thankful to be in security\r\nafter eighteen days of anxiety, never knowing what ambushes we might be\r\nled into; but Talib we heard did not sleep at all and was quite ill from\r\nfright, as contrary to his wishes he was, said the sultan, to be taken to\r\nSheher with us on the morrow.\r\n\r\nGhail Babwazir is an oasis or series of oases of rank fertility, caused\r\nby a stream the water of which is warm and bitter, and which is conducted\r\nby channels cut in the rock in various directions.\r\n\r\nAcres and acres of tobacco, bananas, Indian corn, cotton, and other crops\r\nare thus produced in the wilderness, and this cultivation has given rise\r\nto the overgrown village.\r\n\r\nThe stream was discovered about five hundred years ago by one Sheikh\r\nOmar, and before that time all this part was waste ground.\r\n\r\nThis fertilising spring rises under a hill to the east, where a large\r\nreservoir has been dug out. Above on the hill are some Arab ruins, places\r\nwhere things were stored, and there is a road up. Canals cut some twenty\r\nfeet deep, like the _kanats_ of Persia, conduct the water to the fields.\r\nThe chief product is tobacco, known as Hamoumi tobacco.\r\n\r\nOur roof happened to command a view of the terrace where a bride and her\r\nhandmaidens were making merry with drums and coffee. In spite of the\r\nfrowns and gesticulations of the order-keeper, who flourished her stick\r\nat us and bade us begone, we were able to get a peep, forbidden to males,\r\nat the blushing bride. She wore on her head large silver bosses like tin\r\nplates, her ears were weighed down with jewels, her fingers were straight\r\nwith rings, and her arms a mass of bracelets up to the elbow, and her\r\nbreast was hidden by a multiplicity of necklaces. Her face, of course,\r\nwas painted yellow, with black lines over her eyes and mouth like heavy\r\nmoustaches, and from her nose hung something which looked to us like a\r\ngold coin. The bride herself evidently had no objection to my husband's\r\npresence, but the threatening aspect of her women compelled us\r\nreluctantly to retire.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th we set out for Sheher, or Shaher Bander as it is called, a\r\nmost cheerful set of people, at least as far as our own immediate party\r\nwas concerned; some of the others had little cause for pleasant\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nWe were in advance of the baggage camels, riding our horses and donkey,\r\nand accompanied by Talib, without his dagger, on his camel. Matthaios,\r\nthe Jabberi, and the soldiers surrounding the prisoner Mohammad, attached\r\nby a long rope to my husband's horse, an arrangement not invented by my\r\nhusband, but which we enjoyed very much, and no wonder, after all we had\r\nsuffered!\r\n\r\nThe servants all thought that as soon as might be after getting to Sheher\r\nwe should take ship for Aden, and many were the plans made for vengeance\r\nupon Saleh once he was safe in our clutches on board that ship.\r\n\r\nWe, however, had quite another design, which was that my husband and Imam\r\nSharif and I should go off to Bir Borhut, if the safety of our lives\r\ncould in any way be guaranteed, we taking only Noura, one of the Indian\r\nservants, as our own attendant. Of course the others would be with their\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nSeveral times we went by small passes through gypsum hills, lovely to\r\nbehold, and twice we passed water, not so bitter as Ghail Babwazir. We\r\nhad plenty of up and down hill, but never had to dismount. The way was,\r\nfor the most part, arid and uninteresting. Four years before, in these\r\npasses, the Hamoumi had attacked a caravan and killed nine men, taking\r\neighty camels and 2,000 rupees. They must have had _siyara_, though, from\r\nsome tribe. Each tribe has its fixed tariff. The Hamoumi have\r\ntwenty-seven dollars, the Jabberi seventy, the Tamimi one hundred, &c.,\r\nand when this sum is paid, if you have only one of each tribe with you,\r\nyou are safe.\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone two-thirds of our way we reached a palm-shadowed village\r\ncalled Zarafa. Here we went into a house to eat our luncheon and obtain\r\nsome coffee, which had to be prepaid.\r\n\r\nWe reached Sheher about four o'clock. The last three miles, going\r\neastward, were close along the shore at low tide. It was quite\r\ndelightful, and we were very much amused at all the crabs we put to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nWe were very glad to dismount in the middle of the town, at the gate of\r\nan old castle, and were shown up into a room about 50 feet by 30 feet,\r\nwith a good many chairs, tables, and sofas, arranged stiffly, and all\r\ndusty. Indian cotton carpets covered the floor, and there was a great\r\nnumber of very common lamps with lustres.\r\n\r\nWe waited wearily nearly an hour, while the Sultan Hussein Mia and his\r\nbrother, Sultan Ghalib Mia, put on their best clothes, and at last we\r\nbecame so out of patience that my husband sent a message to the wazir,\r\nasking him to be kind enough to send a man to point out to us a spot\r\nwhere we might pitch our tents, and an answer then was returned that the\r\nsultans were coming. When they appeared, very gorgeous, our letter from\r\nAden was given, with that from Sultan Salàh of Shibahm, and my husband\r\nrequested leave to make a camp. Sultan Hussein looked round him and asked\r\nif this room would not do? Imam Sharif explained to him that we were\r\nrather a large party for such accommodation (the whole of our expedition\r\nbeing then present in the room), that we should require separate\r\napartments, and, therefore, would prefer a private house. We were given\r\ntea in crockery of the commonest kind; I had an odd cup and saucer which\r\nboth leaked badly, and I feared my cup would fall into four pieces, but\r\nthey had come from afar, and I dare say the sultans would be astonished\r\nat the care we take of cracked cups from foreign parts.\r\n\r\nWe were then led on foot quite to the other side of the town, where there\r\nwas a 'summer-house' partly constructed and partly furnished, the\r\nbuilders were on one side and we on the other. We had a room with a\r\ncarpet, a settee, and two little tables, and set up our own beds and\r\nchairs. We had rather a good dinner served by an Indian butler who could\r\ntalk English, so we had hopes of being very comfortable. The summer-house\r\nat that time consisted of two very long rooms back to back, and several\r\nrooms at each end projecting so as to form a verandah for each of the\r\nlong rooms. The back one was quite unfinished then, and upstairs there\r\nwere only rudimentary walls traced out, three or four feet high. There\r\nwas a great square wall surrounding a piece of desert in process of being\r\ntransformed into a garden; the sea sand came quite up to the wall.\r\n\r\nWe found the heat intense, so we had our tent somehow fastened up on the\r\nroof to sleep. All the sides had to be tied up for coolness, but the\r\ndefences against mosquitoes and fleas were very stifling. Goats had been\r\nkept on the roof, and hence the fleas. We could only stay there till\r\nsunrise, and then had to betake ourselves to our suffocating room, to\r\nfind the flies wide awake. We had to use our mosquito curtains by day on\r\ntheir account. In Shibahm the mosquitoes are awake by day only, and at\r\nAden both by day and night.\r\n\r\nImam Sharif found great favour in the eyes of the two sultans, who asked\r\nhim to supper every day. The conversations he had with them about us, and\r\nthe letters they had received from their cousin at Shibahm, did us far\r\nmore good than the letter from the wali of Aden. They said this gave them\r\nno idea other than that my husband was 'only a merchant' or a person of\r\nthat rank. They were very hospitable to us while we were in their town.\r\n\r\nThey examined into our complaints with regard to the treatment we had\r\nexperienced on our journey. Mohammad, who had shot at us, and Ali, the\r\none who had extorted the money from us, were both imprisoned, and this\r\nmoney was made to pay for our last two days' journey. Talib was forced\r\nto repay the thirty dollars and sent to summon the heads of those\r\nvillages which had fired upon us, his sword being taken from him as a\r\ndisgrace, and all were to wait in Sheher, till after Ramadan was over, to\r\nbe judged.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was pleasing to us; however, no money could repay us for\r\nthe anxiety of this journey under the protection of the Jabberi, and we\r\nconsidered it as quite the worst experience we had ever undergone in the\r\ncourse of any of our travels.\r\n\r\nOn reflection we could attribute these troubles neither to any\r\nindiscretion on our part, nor to neglect of care on the part of the\r\nsultan of Shibahm.\r\n\r\nWe have always been perfectly polite in respecting the prejudices of the\r\ninhabitants of the countries through which we have travelled, never, on\r\nthe one hand, classing all non-Europeans as 'natives' and despising high\r\nand low alike as inferior to ourselves in intelligence and everything\r\nelse, nor, on the other, feeling that, having seen a few men, not quite\r\nas white as ourselves, in no matter what country or continent, we\r\nthoroughly understood how to manage 'these niggers.'\r\n\r\nSultan Salàh did, assuredly, his very uttermost to secure our safety and\r\ncomfort, quite disinterestedly. He absolutely refused to take a sum of\r\nmoney, saying, 'I want nothing, I have plenty.' When we determined to\r\nhave some money melted and to have a silver-gilt present made for him, he\r\nheard of our vain inquiries for a non-existent jeweller, and earnestly\r\nbegged that we would do no such thing. 'He loved the English, and only\r\nasked that my husband would mention him favourably to the English\r\nGovernment'--and this favourable mention has gained him nothing.\r\n\r\nIf when my husband asked that a reliable interpreter should be\r\nrecommended to him, he had been sent a man favourably disposed towards\r\nourselves, and capable of inspiring respect in others, instead of a\r\nlittle clerk, aged twenty, from a coal-office, a fanatical Moslem who\r\nhated his employers, we should have been in a much better position, and\r\nhave been able to pass on from the Jabberi to the Hamoumi, whereas\r\ntravelling with the Jabberi through the Hamoumi country we had to\r\nencounter their enemies as well as our own.\r\n\r\nSheher is a detestable place by the sea, set in a wilderness of sand.\r\nOnce it was the chief commercial port of the Hadhramout valley, but now\r\nMakalla has quite superseded it, for Sheher is nothing but an open\r\nroadstead with a couple of _baggalas_ belonging to the family of Al\r\nKaiti, which generally have to go to Hami to shelter, and its buildings\r\nare now falling into ruins, since the Kattiri were driven away. Why\r\nanyone should choose such a place for a town, and continue to live in it,\r\nis mysterious. It is a place so unpleasant with flies and fleas, that the\r\ninhabitants often go to sleep on the seashore. The doors of the houses\r\nare very prettily carved all over, also the cupboards, and lintels to\r\ndoors; we tried to buy some but could not. They have texts from the Koran\r\ncarved on them. We were not allowed to buy them for fear we should work\r\nmagic with them.\r\n\r\nThere is a very picturesque mosque with a sloping minaret, white domes,\r\npalm-trees, and a well, and hard by a house we saw a miniature mosque--a\r\nsort of doll's house--built for children who play at prayers. They can\r\njust crawl into it. It is hung with lamps, and the children make mud pies\r\nof various shapes, which they put in it. Especially during Ramadan they\r\nare encouraged to play at mosque, and the lamps are lit up every evening.\r\nIt is 3 feet high and 3 feet square, and has its little dome, minaret,\r\nand parapet like other mosques.\r\n\r\nThere is an imposing gateway to the town--but built in a kind of\r\nRomanesque style which does not suit Arabia--with long guard-houses on\r\neach side, and various quaint weapons and powder-flasks hung upon it.\r\n\r\nGhalib, the eldest son and heir of the chief of the Al Kaiti family,\r\nruled here as the vicegerent of his father, who is in India as _jemadar_\r\nor general of the Arab troops, nearly all Hadhrami, in the service of the\r\nNizam of Hyderabad. Ghalib was quite an oriental dandy, who lived a life\r\nof some rapidity when in India, so that his father thought it as well to\r\nsend him to rule in Sheher, where the opportunities for mischief are not\r\nso many as at Bombay. He dressed very well in various damask silk coats\r\nand faultless trousers of Indian cut, his swords and daggers sparkled\r\nwith jewels, in his hand he flourished a golden-headed cane, and as the\r\nwater is hard at Sheher, he sends his dirty linen in dhows to Bombay to\r\nbe washed. He was exceedingly good to us, and as we wanted to go along\r\nthe coast for about eighty miles, to get a sight of the mouth of the\r\nHadhramout valley near Saihut, where it empties itself into the Indian\r\nOcean, he arranged that the chief of the dreaded Hamoumi tribe should\r\npersonally escort us, so that there might be no further doubt about our\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nSultan Hussein had married a daughter of Sultan Salàh two years before,\r\nwhen she was eleven years old.\r\n\r\nThe Al Kaiti family have bought up property all round the town, and\r\ntalked of laying out streets and bringing water to Sheher. We heard that\r\none brother had to have all his share in money, and had twenty-two lacs\r\nof rupees, about 150,000_l_.\r\n\r\nWe became very tired of Sheher before we finally left, having to stay a\r\nweek, while arrangements were made for our onward way, and on account of\r\nRamadan no communications could be held with anyone, or business be done\r\ntill sunset. We seemed all day to be the only people alive, and then at\r\nnight we could hardly sleep for the noise.\r\n\r\nOur only pleasures were walks at sunset along the sand, picking up lovely\r\nshells and watching the crabs, and we used to sneak out as quietly as we\r\ncould for fear of being pursued by soldiers. Our little walks were very\r\nmuch shortened when we had an armed escort dogging our steps. Once we got\r\na mile away but were fetched back for fear of the Hamoumi, Sheher being\r\nquite on the frontier. There is a round, black basaltic mountain which\r\nthey call the Hamoumi mountain. The Hamoumi tribe occupy nearly all the\r\nmountainous district east of Sheher, between the Hadhramout valley and\r\nthe sea, and they are reported to be very powerful. Next to them come the\r\ntribe of Mahra.\r\n\r\nEven Sultan Ghalib himself cannot ride far out of his capital\r\nunprotected, because the Hamoumi are his foes.\r\n\r\nWe tried to get leave to go to Saihut in the Mahri country, but that was\r\nimpossible, and at last it really was settled that we should go to Bir\r\nBorhut and Kabr Houd. We were highly delighted, and fear broke out badly\r\nagain among the servants, who dreaded the very name of those places. They\r\ngladly took permission to remain behind. All arrangements about _siyara_\r\nwere made, and we were never to stop more than one night anywhere, and to\r\nreturn by a different way, and the day of departure was settled; but the\r\nday before that fixed, it became apparent that we Christians could by no\r\nmeans be permitted to go near Kabr Houd, and that the time occupied for\r\nthe journey would now be thirty-one days, and we must wait till after\r\nRamadan. It was to be a mere journey without our seeing anything that we\r\nwanted to see, and it was getting very late and hot, and we did not feel\r\nwe could spend so long a time for so little; therefore we gave up all\r\nidea of seeing Bir Borhut and Kabr Houd that year. It was to have cost\r\nus 670 dollars, at seven to the pound sterling.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Maria Theresa dollars are always spoken of as _reals_. You\r\nhave to buy them dear, two rupees and a varying amount of annas, and are\r\ntold they are very hard to get. They are tied up in bags, and you may\r\nvery well trust the banker for the number of coins; but if you are wise\r\nyou will examine them all, for any dirty ones, or any that are the least\r\nworn or obliterated, or that have any cut or mark on them, will be\r\nrejected and considered bad in the interior. When you return to\r\ncivilisation you hasten to the banker to change these dollars, and you\r\nsell them cheap, for you are told that there is now little demand for\r\ndollars, they are quite going out of use and rupees only are used--quite\r\na fable. No matter how many extra annas you may have paid, the dollar\r\nonly passes for two rupees in the interior. We lost 1,100 rupees on this\r\none journey between our departure from Aden and our return to Aden.\r\n\r\nWe next settled to go to Mosaina along the coast, and still to start on\r\nthe appointed day. Therefore we were up betimes (what little baggage we\r\nwere to take being bound in bundles the day before), packed our beds, and\r\nthen we waited; it was not certain till four o'clock that no camels were\r\ncoming. No one could do anything, as the sultan had no power beyond his\r\nown dominions, and the camel-men were all foreigners.\r\n\r\nHowever, next morning seven camels came and we were quickly on the road,\r\ncausing great terror to the crabs. When I say the road I mean the sand at\r\nlow tide.\r\n\r\nWe had the chief of all the Hamoumi with us, a very old, rich, and dirty\r\nman, but most precious to us as a safeguard. Two of his sons were kept as\r\nhostages in Sheher till we should return in peace.\r\n\r\nWe also had the governor of Kosseir with us, as well as men of the\r\nvarious little tribes whose country we were to traverse, as _siyara_. The\r\ncamels and _siyara_ cost twelve dollars. The camels were hired by the\r\njob, twelve days, so it would not pay them to dawdle.\r\n\r\nWe had told the sultans how Saleh had behaved and asked them to keep him\r\nunder their eyes till our return, and this is how we managed without him\r\nas interpreter. We talked English to Imam Sharif, he talked Hindustani to\r\nhis Afghan servant Majid, Majid talked his own tongue to an Afghan whom\r\nwe annexed at Sheher, and he could speak Arabic. We got on very well, but\r\nas such a party had to be assembled to say important things, we had to\r\nstruggle to express simple things ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCOASTING EASTWARD BY LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey was delightful, nearly all the way by the edge of the sea,\r\npast miles and miles of little mounds thrown up by the crabs in making\r\ntheir holes: daily they make them, and they are daily washed away by the\r\ntide. They live in holes higher up, but these are refuges for the day\r\nwhile they are scavenging in the sea. They were nearly under the feet of\r\nthe horses. Near Sheher we passed the mouth of the Arfa river, where\r\nthere is water, and near it are horribly smelling tanks where they make\r\nfish oil.\r\n\r\nWe had to make a deviation of two miles inland to cross the estuary of\r\nthe Wadi Gherid, and then go down to the sea again, but the last mile was\r\nover a low cliff covered with a smash of huge shells. It must be a\r\nfurious place in a storm. We passed a wretched hamlet consisting of a few\r\narbours and a well, whose waters are both bitter and salt.\r\n\r\nHami (hot), where we stopped, is sixteen miles from Sheher. It is most\r\npicturesquely situated at the foot of some low spurs, volcanic in nature,\r\nand is fertilised by a stream so very hot that you can hardly put your\r\nhands in it; indeed, in the tanks where it is collected in large volume,\r\nit is quite impossible. It is much cooler in the little irrigation\r\nchannels, which have hard beds from the incrustation of the sulphur. The\r\nwater is very nasty when hot, but much better when it cools. We did not\r\nenjoy our tea at all in Hami. We were encamped in a delightful spot\r\nunder both date and cocoanut-trees, and hot baths were a pleasure to\r\neveryone. I had to wait a long time till mine in the tent was cool\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThere was a great flutter when we arrived on the scene, for there were a\r\nlarge number of women and girls bathing. They did not seem to mind their\r\nown relations seeing them, but on our approach they rushed into their\r\nblue dresses and fled.\r\n\r\nThis sulphureous stream makes the crops grow prodigiously, and we walked\r\nthrough fields of jowari and Indian corn as high as our heads. At our\r\ncamp we had a delicious sea-breeze, but in our walks abroad we got an\r\noccasional whiff of the little fish which were being boiled down to make\r\noil for lamps and colours used in ship-painting.\r\n\r\nWe paid a visit to the governor of Hami, who received us on the roof of\r\nhis house, where many were assembled, and scarcely had he greeted us when\r\nthey all fell to praying, the mollah standing in front to lead, and all\r\nthe others standing in a row behind. After that they gave us coffee with\r\nno sugar, followed by tea with far too much, and they pressed us to stay\r\nwith them and partake of their evening meal, but we declined politely and\r\nretired to our camp.\r\n\r\nOn March 11 we started for Dis without any rows or brawls whatever. Dis\r\nis fifteen miles off. We never went down to the shore at all that day,\r\nbut travelled over a barren, undulating country which runs out to sea and\r\nforms Ras Bagashwa. We went for half a mile close above the sea on a\r\ncliff 20 or 30 feet high, with many shells, some in an ordinary state,\r\nsome half petrified, and some wholly so, but none embedded in the stone.\r\nAfter travelling three hours and a half we passed over and amongst a\r\nrange of low hills, a volcanic jumble with earths of all colours, seams\r\nof gypsum stuck up edgeways, and many other things.\r\n\r\nI used once to sigh and groan over not having brought a geologist with\r\nus, but I was wiser by that time. It was enough to think of his specimens\r\nand their transport, to say nothing of the responsibility for his safety.\r\nStill my husband and I often wished we knew more of geology than we did.\r\n\r\nWhen the geologist does visit these parts he must make a special bargain\r\nwith his camel-men, not based on his apparent, present, visible baggage,\r\nbut upon what it may expand to. He might arrange to pay at the end\r\naccording to the results of his journey. On one of the dreadful days with\r\nthe Jabberi, the man whose camel carried the botanical boxes positively\r\nrefused to load up, on account of having seen stones with lichen put in;\r\nand but for the fact of his being last and that all the other camels had\r\nstarted, we might have had to throw the things away.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to see at Dis but a sudden oasis of fertility caused by\r\na _ghail_, but the report of an inscription led my husband a long\r\nwild-goose chase. The district is very populous, and from the old forts\r\nnear it evidently has been and is a very prosperous place.\r\n\r\nWe had a great many patients, and were nearly driven wild with starers.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the crowd we pitched our tent tight up against a field of\r\nsugar-canes, but so anxious were the populace to see me, that the whole\r\nfield was trodden down and no one seemed to mind. There were perpetual\r\nshouts for the 'woman' to come out. On this part of the journey, as well\r\nas in the Hadhramout, I was always simply spoken of as the _Horma_ (plur.\r\n_Harem_) and never as _Bibi_ (lady).\r\n\r\nThere were some very light-skinned Arabs at Dis, with long dark hair,\r\nwhich they dress with grease, wearing round their neck a cocoanut\r\ncontaining a supply of this toilet-requisite for the purpose. Most of\r\nthem affect red plaid cotton turbans and waist-cloths, a decided relief\r\nto the eye from the perpetual indigo.\r\n\r\nWe had a very damp night, not from rain but from dew, though there is\r\nmore rain in this part than in the interior.\r\n\r\nWe had an uninteresting march next day, over desert and many stones, up\r\nand down hill, past a village called Ghaida, and went somewhat out of our\r\nway to see a rock with bitumen or asphalte oozing out of it. We went\r\nfifteen miles and encamped near Bagashwa on the margin of a large and\r\npretty pool made by recent rains, with bushes round it. Though pretty,\r\nthis pool was not clean. Almost before we could dismount the camels were\r\nunloaded and in it, my horse immediately followed, and likewise all the\r\ncamel-men, and by the time our vessels could be unpacked to fetch the\r\ndrinking water, the soldiers were washing their clothes, consequently our\r\nwater was turbid and of mingled flavours.\r\n\r\nLater my husband took a bath, and said he felt as if he was sitting in\r\nwarm oil.\r\n\r\nMy horse, for two days after this, was afflicted with a mysterious\r\nbleeding from the mouth which we did not till then discover was caused by\r\nthree leeches under his tongue. We did not like to put the bit in, so the\r\nimmense iron ring which was usually round his chin hung round his neck\r\nand clanked like the clapper of a bell, while the nose was thrust through\r\nthat part meant for his ears.\r\n\r\nSome pastoral Bedouin were encamped near here, whose abodes are about the\r\nsimplest I ever saw: just four posts stuck in the ground with a roof of\r\nmats to afford some shelter from the sun; on this roof they hang their\r\ncooking utensils, their only impedimenta when they move. One old woman\r\nwas boiling a pot of porridge, another was grinding grain on a stone,\r\nanother was frying little fish on a stick, whilst the men were engaged in\r\npicketing the kids on a rope with a very loose noose round each little\r\nneck, and preparing the oil-cakes for their camels. We had just sunlight\r\nleft to photograph them, and perpetuate the existence of this most\r\nprimitive life. Young camels are reared here.\r\n\r\nWe were so lucky as to discover a scorpion that had travelled in our tent\r\nfrom Dis, before it could do us harm.\r\n\r\nThat day one of the Bedou soldiers came to me and asked me in a\r\nconfidential sort of whisper, 'Are you a man or a woman?'\r\n\r\nWe were five hours on our journey to Kosseir (11 miles), which was our\r\nnext stage, over stones first, then over heavy sand to the shore again.\r\nThere were not so many shells, seaweeds, corals, crabs, madrepores,\r\nsponges, and flamingoes as we had seen near Sheher, but hundreds of\r\nseagulls sitting in the shallow water, and quantities of porpoises. The\r\nlobster-shells which lie about are a beautiful blue mixed with red.\r\n\r\nThe great stretch of basalt which runs for fully fifteen miles along the\r\ncoast, with Kosseir in the middle, caused us to mount on to the rocks\r\nsome little distance before reaching Kosseir, and when we got quite near\r\nwe sat on a rocky hillock, contemplating the town and awaiting our\r\n_kafila_, that we might arrive with all the dignity due to the governor.\r\nAll our baggage was on five camels and the old sultan of the Hamoumi on\r\nthe sixth, so we really need not have had the seventh. That dirty old\r\nBedou owns many houses in Ghail Babwazir and other places.\r\n\r\nThe governor was a very thin old man very like Don Quixote, his scanty\r\nhair and beard dyed red with henna. He had been governor five years\r\nbefore, and was now reappointed at the request of the town, so great were\r\nthe rejoicings, manifested by the firing of many guns. Some came to meet\r\nhim at the rock, some stayed in the town, some appeared on the tops of\r\nthe numerous towers, but no matter where they were, one and all, as well\r\nas those who came with us, fired off their guns whenever they liked,\r\nunder our noses, in and from every direction. Our animals did not mind\r\none bit.\r\n\r\nThe governor and all the foot-passengers arrived in the town with their\r\nfeet twice the natural size from the clinging mud, through which we had\r\nto pass, and which necessitated great scraping of feet and picking out\r\nbetween toes with daggers.\r\n\r\nWe were most pleasantly received and taken upstairs in the governor's\r\ncastle to a roofless room with a kind of shed along one side, and here we\r\nsubsided on mats, very hot, and soon a most powerfully strong tincture of\r\ntea with much sugar, ginger, and cinnamon was administered to us; and\r\nthough the kind old governor was so busy being welcomed by his happy old\r\nfriends, he was always coming to see that we were properly attended to.\r\n\r\nWe had our camp in his yard, where we had a very comfortable room, and\r\nenjoyed having his wall round us very much.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we went on the shore and about the town. The town is on a\r\nsmall point and approached from the west it seems to 'lie four-square'\r\nand to present a very strong appearance, 'with its yetts, its castle, and\r\na'.' We rode in by the gate on the northern side and were surprised to\r\nfind that the side towards the sea had no wall, but only four detached\r\ntowers. There were fishing-boats on the beach, with the planks just sewn\r\ntogether with cords.\r\n\r\nThe long line of black basalt, jutting into capes here and there, is\r\nthought by the Arabs to be formed by the ashes of infidel towns. The tiny\r\nport of Kosseir is just a nook where the boats can nestle behind a small,\r\nlow, natural breakwater of the basalt. Boats lie on either side,\r\naccording to the wind.\r\n\r\nNext we went to Raida, three hours all along the top of the cliff; the\r\nold Hamoumi sultan was with us, of course, otherwise there would have\r\nbeen no safety for us beyond Kosseir.\r\n\r\nWe had a dreadful experience passing the village of Sarrar. The smell\r\nfrom the cemetery was so awful that even the Bedouin had to hold their\r\nnoses for many yards on both sides of it.\r\n\r\nThe village of Sarrar only consists of three large mud houses and a good\r\nmany bamboo shanties.\r\n\r\nWe were amused by a man whom we met alone, his terror of us was so great.\r\nAs we approached he lit his match, got his gun all ready, and left the\r\npath seeking cover, but our people shouted: 'What good can you do? You\r\nare one and we are many, and besides we mean you no harm!' so he came\r\nforward, and there was great laughter both at and with him.\r\n\r\nRaida is a large fishing village. Certainly there are strange eaters in\r\nthese parts. The Ichthyophagoi here prefer their fish generally in a\r\ndecayed state; and one of our Hamoumi soldiers had a treat of lizards,\r\nwhich he popped in the fire to roast and ate whole.\r\n\r\nWe did not get much farther eastward that year, only two hours farther to\r\nRakhmit, a very uninteresting journey, but we were buoyed up by hopes of\r\nsome very delightful inscriptions that were described to us: one on the\r\nway to Mosaina, to which we were supposed to be going that day, and\r\nanother in a cave, quite close to Mosaina. When we reached the river-bed\r\nat Rakhmit, a spot in the mountains about five miles off was pointed out;\r\nso after very much and long consultation with the aged sultan, we decided\r\nit would be safer to camp where we were, see Mosaina next day, and\r\nreturn to the same camp. However, when we were quite prepared to go the\r\nfive miles, it appeared that it might be dangerous. It was in the country\r\nof no one then present, so we could have no _siyara_, and the old Hamoumi\r\nchief said it would be bad for his sons, the hostages; so this plan had\r\nto be abandoned.\r\n\r\nAfterwards it was revealed to us that the cave is twenty miles from\r\nMosaina on the akaba, that there is no water near, no village at Mosaina,\r\nno means of getting forage; so, as in that case farther progress was\r\nuseless, as well as impossible, we proposed to return the following day\r\nto Kosseir, helping ourselves, if possible, with a boat from Raida.\r\n\r\nIt took us three hours to return to Raida, where an old seyyid took us\r\ninto his house and led us to a little clean room, 10 feet by 6 feet, and\r\nthere we settled down on the matting to rest and have our luncheon till\r\none o'clock, when we started, leaving the baggage camels to follow.\r\n\r\nHow thankful we were that, tastes differing, there were people in Arabia\r\nwho could look upon us as harmless and pleasant individuals. Everyone had\r\nbeen nice to us, and we had had no difficulties whatever, and been\r\ntreated like human beings, just because we had not that horrid little\r\nSaleh Hassan with us. The more civil people were to us the more enraged\r\nwe were with him, and I think if the servants had carried out their\r\nthreats against him when he should be on the dhow, the masters would not\r\nhave interfered.\r\n\r\nIt is fifteen miles from Raida to Kosseir. We were quite determined,\r\nafter the severe lesson we had had two days previously, to go to windward\r\nof Sarrar. When we passed a well there I was requested to detach myself\r\nfrom the party and go and let some women see me, and then the soldiers\r\nbegged that I would show off Basha prancing about that the women might\r\nsee that I did not want holding on, and finally they shouted 'Shilloh!'\r\nto make him gallop away, amid screams of delight. I dare say these women\r\nhad never seen a horse. The sultans at Sheher had only three. We had\r\nalready sent Zubda back to Al Koton. The soldiers were very fond of\r\nterrifying my horse, when passing a village and I wanted to stare about,\r\nto show him off.\r\n\r\nIn avoiding Sarrar we got into great difficulties with the loose sand. We\r\nwent over it half a mile, and when we reached the sea there was so narrow\r\na strip of firm sand that, our animals being too much afraid of the\r\nrising tide, we had to make our way up again. We reached Kosseir about\r\nhalf-past five, warmly welcomed by Don Quixote, who gave us coffee while\r\nawaiting our _kafila_, which was, to our surprise and delight, only half\r\nan hour behind us, not having been fighting with the sand.\r\n\r\nWe were made more angry with Saleh by finding that water, wood, forage,\r\neggs, fish, and a little milk had been prepared for us beforehand. My\r\nnight was disturbed by the old Hamoumi chief choosing the eave of our\r\ntent just beside my ear to say his prayers. Quiet nights, however, must\r\nnot be expected in Ramazan.\r\n\r\nNext morning we were off at eight, of course dragging the poor wizened\r\nold gentleman with us on a camel, two hours (6 miles) up the Wadi Shirwan\r\nto see a ruin at the village of Maaber, where there is a running stream.\r\n\r\nAt the entrance to Wadi Shirwan the ruins are situated. They consist of a\r\nlarge fort, circular on one side and about 40 feet in diameter, built of\r\nround, water-worn stones set in very strong cement, dating from the same\r\nperiod as those at Ghail Babwazir.\r\n\r\nEvidently the mediæval inhabitants of Arabia chose these two points for\r\ngood water. Tobacco is also grown here, besides other things. The water\r\nis really good and sweet.\r\n\r\nWe behaved with the greatest temerity in entering these ruins; no one now\r\nliving had been in before we did. The building is the abode of _jinni_,\r\nand no one who goes in is ever able to come out by the same door. We were\r\nso fortunate as to be able to do so. On the road we saw a stone, and were\r\ntold that a _jinni_ (or _ghinni_ as they are called in Southern Arabia)\r\nwas bringing this to help to build the fort when he was met by another\r\n_jinni_ who said, 'Why do you bring stones when the fort is finished?' so\r\nhe dropped it in disgust.\r\n\r\n_Jinni_ are able to get sufficiently near to heaven to hear the\r\nconversation of the angels, and there are various incantations to make\r\nthem reveal the whereabouts of hidden treasures. One called _darb el\r\nmendel_, carried on with a handkerchief, is much in vogue.\r\n\r\nMaaber nestles under a big pointed rock on the highland, which sticks up\r\naloft, and to which we heard that the Kafirs used to tie their horses.\r\nBottles were stuck into the graves as ornaments, and built on to the tops\r\nof buildings.\r\n\r\nWe rested beneath a b'dom-tree, which showered its little fruits on us,\r\nand made as many inquiries as possible in a crowd of starers who were all\r\nvery polite.\r\n\r\nWe heard that Wadi Shekhavi is the end of Wadi Mosila. It runs parallel\r\nto, and is almost as large as, the Wadi Hadhramout. Ghail Benzamin is the\r\nprincipal town in it.\r\n\r\nAt last, feeling that our work and our researches were as thoroughly done\r\nas in our power lay, we arose and turned our faces toward England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCOASTING WESTWARD BY SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThough we rose so early next morning that we dressed by candle-light, we\r\nwere not up nearly so early as Imam Sharif, who, being sleepy and misled\r\nby a candle in our tent, aroused his followers and made them light their\r\nfire for breakfast at midnight. Kind old Don Quixote and many others\r\nwalked with us a mile to Ras Dis, where we were to embark; this is the\r\nharbour of the town of Kosseir. Ras Dis is not near Dis, as Ras Bagashwa\r\nruns out between them. Probably before the interstices of the black rock\r\nwere filled up there may have been a decent harbour for small craft. Two\r\nforts guard the way to Ras Dis, and near it are two wali's or sheikh's\r\ntombs which afford perfectly safe store-places to the fishermen. All\r\ntheir gear, anchors, ropes, sails, wood, fish, and what not are heaped\r\nround the tombs, and none dare touch them.\r\n\r\nHaving been carried into a filthy boat, we scrambled into a _sambouka_\r\ncrammed and stuffed with the baggage--eight passengers, including the\r\nAfghan interpreter.\r\n\r\nThere was a little deck 3 feet by 4 feet at its widest, where Imam Sharif\r\nand I were packed, the steersman sitting in a little angle, leaning\r\nagainst my gaiters. About ten o'clock Matthaios began to make some tea,\r\nbut soon had to retreat to the bow very sick. My husband finished this\r\ncookery, and from a small hole in the baggage handed me what little food\r\nhe could reach, but soon everyone was expanded over the baggage, no one\r\nhaving room for his legs. Imam Sharif was soon a wretched heap, and not\r\nan appetite was left among our party but my husband's and mine. We had\r\nnothing but a little _halwa_ (a sweetmeat) and no water, till the end of\r\nour eighteen hours' voyage, so we rather envied the others who seemed\r\nunconscious of the smells of cockroaches, bilge-water, and fish oil, as\r\nwell as of the great heat, for we had no awning.\r\n\r\nThe wind was favourable, but there was little of it, and fearing it would\r\nfail entirely we planned to land, taking food, which would then be\r\nattainable, and the one blanket we each had kept out, not knowing how\r\nlong we should be at sea, and lie in the sand, but we wasted an hour of\r\ngreat trouble in a vain attempt. The shore was too shelving, so we\r\ndressed ourselves in our blankets and settled down to catch bugs. We had\r\nseen few by day, but by night they kept us busy, for they swarmed over us\r\nwith their descendants and their remote ancestors.\r\n\r\nOnce we saw some operations which made us think we were going to tack,\r\nbut to our dismay we perceived the captain hovering over his bedding, and\r\nfound that he had put the ship to bed, and we were meant to be violently\r\nrocked in the cradle of the deep till morning; but he was firmly reasoned\r\nwith, and at two in the morning, worn and weary, we were borne ashore at\r\nSheher.\r\n\r\nIt being Ramazan, we easily found the Indian cook of the house, and asked\r\nfor some boiled eggs, but not till four did we get some very nasty fried\r\nones and tea, and then lay down on the floor anyhow, to fight with\r\nmosquitoes and fleas, our baggage and beds being still on board; regular\r\nquarantine measures were carried out as regards bugs when it came. I felt\r\ntoo weak to stir till luncheon was brought me at twelve, there having\r\nbeen some little difficulty as regarded breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe horse, donkeys, camels, _siyara_ people, and soldiers all came in by\r\nland next day.\r\n\r\nA period of waiting and hoping for a ship to take us to Aden now set in.\r\nOur annoyances were rather aggravated by some Indian converts to\r\nMohammedanism being taught their prayers well within our hearing.\r\n\r\nA promising ship was said to have gone to Hami for water, and anxiously\r\nwe turned our eyes in that direction for three days, till we were in such\r\ndesperation that my husband went down to find any small boat to take us\r\nas far as Makalla, but the ship had come at last and we were able to\r\nleave.\r\n\r\nHussein Mia and Ghalib Mia took leave of us with much friendliness and\r\nhopes of seeing us the following year, which they did.\r\n\r\nMia is a kind of title.\r\n\r\nWe were told that the captain had gone on board with the baggage, but we\r\nfound it covering a vast expanse of sand, live hens, dead foxes, swords,\r\nspears, and other strange things making it look very unlike Christian\r\nbaggage. We also had quantities of cocoanuts, that we might have some\r\npalatable water on the voyage. A bargain was made with much shouting in a\r\ngreat crowd, to put us and all belonging to us on board for four dollars.\r\n\r\nI was quietly looking on when a man came suddenly behind me and whipped\r\nme up, seated me on his shoulder and carried me off into the sea. It\r\nrequired all my balance to keep safe when so suddenly seized. I did not\r\nknow I was being scrambled for as the lightest person. I hate that way of\r\nbeing carried, with my five fingers digging into the skull of my bearer,\r\nwith one of his wrists placed lightly across my ankles, while he holds up\r\nhis clothes with the other; and I do not like being perched between the\r\nelbows of two men, whose hands are clasped far beneath me, while I\r\nclutch their dirty throats. It is much nicer to be carried in both arms\r\nlike a baby.\r\n\r\nOur ship lay tossing so far out that we had to be put in a good large\r\nboat first and as I sat amidships I was well ducked when those who had\r\nbeen pushing the boat off all jumped in, shedding sheets of water from\r\ntheir garments.\r\n\r\nOur ship did not look smart; on the contrary it looked so untidy that it\r\nhad a kind of mossy, woolly, licheny appearance. There was no ladder, so\r\nit was rather hard to climb up the side in that uneasy sea. My first care\r\nwas to scramble up ropes and various other things to survey the little\r\ndeck, sure that Saleh had taken care of himself. There were two charpoys\r\nor stretchers tied one to each side of this little deck, and we\r\ndetermined that Imam Sharif should have one, and the 'botanist' the\r\nother. Saleh's things were settled on the latter. I at once ousted them\r\nand lay down till the proper occupant appeared, looking evidently anxious\r\nto assume a recumbent position.\r\n\r\nSaleh then put himself and his property in a place which I told him was\r\ninconvenient as no one could pass.\r\n\r\n'I only stay here a little while,' he said. 'Mr. Lunt has my place.'\r\n\r\n'Your place!' I said. 'How did you get a place?'\r\n\r\n'I told the _Nakhoda_ to keep that place for me.'\r\n\r\nI said, 'Had you first asked Mr. Bent where he wished you to sleep or\r\nwhere he wished Mr. Lunt to sleep?'\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Well remember that Mr. Bent is master on board this ship and I am\r\nmistress,' I said. 'I have given that bed to Mr. Lunt, and you can go\r\n_there_, and as you have a habit of spitting on floors and carpets you\r\nwill now spit overboard or you will move.' So Saleh began to take a back\r\nseat. He was positively afraid to be among the servants.\r\n\r\nAny excitement at sea is welcome, so we now began to take a great\r\ninterest in him and Mahmoud. We were quite anxious as to whether they\r\nwould be sea-sick or not. You might wonder why we cared, but this is the\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIf they were sea-sick their fast of Ramazan would be broken, and all\r\ntheir previous fasting would go for nothing; they would gain nothing by\r\ngoing on with it, and might eat as much as they liked.\r\n\r\nAll the Indian party had taken advantage of the excuse of travelling to\r\neat as usual.\r\n\r\nMahmoud soon broke down and rejoiced greatly thereafter, but Saleh\r\nreached the end of the day and his evening meal in safety, but his fast\r\ncame to an abrupt termination early in the morning.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem a wildly funny idea that putting food into your mouth by\r\nthe back door (the throat) involuntarily should be quite as bad for your\r\nsoul as voluntarily putting it in at the front door (the lips)?\r\n\r\nWe started at half-past five and reached Makalla at sunrise the following\r\nmorning, Easter Sunday, March 25. Our arrival being announced, the Sultan\r\nManassar invited us to see him, and he and his ugly sons were all dressed\r\nup again, and we had tea and _halwa_. Saleh kept running about trying to\r\nwhisper to all the wazirs. My husband kept him under his eye as much as\r\npossible, but once he escaped and ran back and begged the sultan for a\r\nbox of honey and a carpet. He only got the former, so he returned and was\r\nvery abusive to my husband, saying it was his fault; I told him he could\r\nsay what he liked at Aden, but had better be quiet as long as he was on\r\nthe sea with us.\r\n\r\nMy husband graciously gave permission to ship a cargo of frankincense,\r\nand the ship was filled with delightfully sweet, clean bales, on which\r\nour luggage and men could be accommodated, and we were glad of the\r\nballast.\r\n\r\nWe had three more days and nights on the sea, and during the last had a\r\nmiserable fear of a calm; but at last a fine wind sprang up and we\r\nwhizzed along, all sitting up in our beds, loudly rejoicing with one\r\nanother on the prospects of our arrival at the haven where we would be,\r\nwhich took place at sunrise on March the 27th.\r\n\r\nI am thankful to say that the work of our expedition was successful in\r\nall its branches; but what we should have done without Imam Sharif, Khan\r\nBahadur, I cannot tell. He was the greatest help to us in every way, and\r\nit was an untold comfort to have one brave person as anxious to get on as\r\nourselves. I have always been sorry that the map was made on so small a\r\nscale--eight miles to an inch. It would have been more useful to future\r\ntravellers had it been larger. The spelling had, of course, to be\r\naccording to the ancient Indian method, and not that now recommended by\r\nthe Royal Geographical Society, to which I have adhered myself.\r\n\r\nThe year before, when we were embarking for England on board a\r\nMessageries steamer at Aden, we noticed an Indian gentleman standing in\r\nthe angle of the landing of the ladder to let us and our baggage pass,\r\nand little we thought how well we should know that Indian gentleman, and\r\nhe on his side had no inkling how far he would travel, two successive\r\nyears, with all that baggage around him; it would have been so\r\ninteresting could we have guessed. Imam Sharif was returning from\r\nZanzibar, and leaving that ship to tranship for India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF\r\n\r\nDHOFAR AND THE GARA-RANGE.\r\n\r\nFrom a Survey by Imam Sharif,\r\n\r\nKhan Bahadur.\r\n\r\nTO ILLUSTRATE THE EXPLORATIONS OF\r\n\r\nM^r. J. THEODORE BENT.\r\n\r\n_Stanford's Geog.^l Estab.^t, London_\r\n\r\nLondon: Smith, Elder & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDHOFAR AND THE GARA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nMERBAT AND AL HAFA\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter returning from our expedition to the Hadhramout in 1894 we\r\ndetermined the next winter to attempt the ambitious adventure of making a\r\njourney overland right across Southern Arabia from Maskat to Aden. On our\r\nway we hoped to revisit the Hadhramout, to explore those portions which\r\nwe had been compelled to leave unvisited the former winter, and so to\r\nfill up the large blank space which still exists on the map of this\r\ncountry. Experience taught us that our plan was impracticable; the only\r\npossible way of making explorations in Arabia is to take it piecemeal, to\r\ninvestigate each district separately, and by degrees to make a complete\r\nmap by patching together the results of a number of isolated expeditions.\r\nIndeed, this is the only satisfactory way of seeing any country, for on a\r\ngreat through journey the traveller generally loses the most interesting\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nMy husband again, to our great satisfaction, had Imam Sharif, Khan\r\nBahadur, placed at his disposal; and, as the longest way round was the\r\nquickest and best, we determined to make our final preparations in India,\r\nand meet him and his men at Karachi.\r\n\r\nWe left England at the beginning of November 1894, and at Aden, where we\r\nwere obliged to tranship, we picked up our camp furniture, which we had\r\ndeposited there on our return from Wadi Hadhramout.\r\n\r\nImam Sharif came on board to meet us at Karachi, and we also received a\r\nletter inviting us to stay at Government House, where we were most kindly\r\nentertained by Mrs. Pottinger, in the absence of her brother, Mr. James,\r\nthe Commissioner in Scinde. This was very delightful to us, as we had\r\nalready stayed in Reynolds's Hotel when on our way to Persia.\r\n\r\nMatthaios had absolutely refused to come with us for fear we should carry\r\nout our great wish of going to Bir Borhut, and indeed the very name of\r\n'_Aravia_' was odious to him. Of course, being in India, we had to take\r\ntwo men in his place, and accordingly engaged two Goanese, half\r\nPortuguese: one Diego S. Anna Lobo, a little old man, as butler, and the\r\nother, Domingo de Silva, as cook. The former could speak English and\r\nPortuguese; the latter neither, only Hindustani. We took them back to\r\nIndia with us the following spring, keeping Lobo as our servant during\r\nthe time of our stay there.\r\n\r\nWe had a calm and pleasant voyage of three days to Maskat with Captain\r\nWhitehead on the B.I.S.N. steamer _Chanda_, arriving just in time to\r\nescape a violent storm, which lasted for days, and in its commencement\r\nprevented our landing at the usual place. We had to go round a little\r\npromontory. There was also a good deal of rain, which cooled the air\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nWe were the guests of Colonel Hayes Sadler, in his hospitable Residency,\r\nand he interested himself kindly in our affairs, giving us all the help\r\nhe could in our arrangements, as did also Dr. Jayaker, the Indian doctor.\r\n\r\nWe intended first of all to penetrate into the regions of the Jebel\r\nAkhdar, and then to pass through the territory of the Jenefa tribe to\r\nGhubbet el Hashish, which takes its name not from land grass, but from\r\nseaweed. There a boat was to meet us and take us westward; in this way we\r\nshould avoid a stretch of desert which the Bedouin themselves shrink\r\nfrom, and which is impassable to Europeans. We could not procure any\r\ninformation about our journey to the Jebel Akhdar, as it does not appear\r\nto be the fashion at Maskat to go inland. However, both our old friend\r\nthe Sultan Feysul and Colonel Sadler took infinite trouble to arrange for\r\nour journey; camels were hired and a horse for me, and the sheikhs of the\r\ntribes through whose country we should have to pass were summoned to\r\nescort us.\r\n\r\nOwing, however, to the illness of some of our party, we were at the last\r\nmoment obliged to defer the expedition; though we had made all the\r\npreparations we could for the great cold we should have to encounter, the\r\nchange of climate would have been injurious to Imam Sharif and two of his\r\nmen. As events proved it was fortunate we did so, for the insurrection\r\n(which I have already mentioned) broke out almost immediately afterwards,\r\nand in all probability we should not have returned alive to relate our\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nWe next determined to go by sea to Merbat, and thence explore the Dhofar\r\nand Gara mountains. The sultan offered us the use of his _batil_, which\r\nwas preparing to go to Zenghiber, as they call Zanzibar. We found on\r\ninspection that it was a small decked boat, with a very light upper deck\r\nat the stern, supported by posts. They were busy smearing the ship with\r\nfish oil. We were told it might be ready in three days, and we might take\r\nseven days or more over the voyage. However, we were delivered from this\r\nlong voyage, for, unexpectedly, a steamer arrived most opportunely for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nAs it was not the pilgrim season, and as there was no cholera about, we\r\nventured on this steamer, which is one of those that ply under the\r\nTurkish flag between the Persian Gulf and Jedda. The captain was an\r\nArmenian: in fact, all the steamers belonging to Turkey are run by\r\nArmenian companies and manned by Armenian sailors. The captain of the\r\n_Hodeida_ was not too exorbitant in his demand of 500 rupees to drop our\r\nparty at Merbat. The steward could fortunately speak Greek.\r\n\r\nWe left Maskat on Monday, December 17, and had a very calm voyage, but\r\nthis being our fifth steamer since we left home, we were anxious for a\r\nlittle dry land journeying.\r\n\r\nWe saw the high mountains all Tuesday, but nothing on Wednesday after\r\nearly morning. The coast recedes and becomes low where the desert comes\r\ndown to the sea. We passed the Kouria Mouria Islands in the night. They\r\nare inhabited by the Jenefa tribe, who pursue sharks, swimming on\r\ninflated skins. On Thursday we passed very curious scenery, a high akaba,\r\njust like the Hadhramout, in the background, and for about a mile between\r\nthis and the sea a volcanic mass of rocks and peaks and crags of many\r\nhues. After passing this we were at our destination, and at three o'clock\r\nin the afternoon we left the steamer to land at Merbat. We were conveyed\r\nto the shore in three boats, one of which was called 'el liebot.' It is\r\nonly fair that the English who have borrowed so many nautical terms from\r\nthe Orientals, should now in their turn provide the Arabian name for a\r\nboat. Cutters and jolly-boats have taken their names from 'kattira' and\r\n'jahlibot.'\r\n\r\nMerbat, which is sixty-four miles from Maskat, is the first point of the\r\nDhofar district after the long stretch of desert has been passed. It is a\r\nwretched little spot consisting of some fifty houses and a few Bedou\r\nhuts, with about two hundred inhabitants. It is built on a tongue of\r\nland, which affords shelter for Arab dhows during the north-east monsoon.\r\nThe water supply is from a pool of brackish water.\r\n\r\nThe excitement caused by the first arrival of a steamer was intense, and\r\ntiny craft with naked Bedouin soon crowded round us; after entrusting us\r\nto their tender mercies our Armenian captain steamed away, and it was not\r\nwithout secret misgivings that we landed amongst the wild-looking\r\ninhabitants who lined the shore.\r\n\r\nWe imagined we were being very kindly received when they pointed out the\r\nlargest building in the place as our habitation, and my husband, Imam\r\nSharif, our interpreter Hassan, and I joyfully hastened thither.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we had no recommendation to the head-man of this place, and\r\nhe evidently distrusted us, for after taking us to a fort built of mud\r\nbricks, which offered ample accommodation for our party, he flatly\r\nrefused to allow us to have our baggage or our servants therein.\r\n\r\nAfter entering a kind of guard-room, we had to plunge to the right into\r\npitchy darkness and stumble along, stretching out our hands like blind\r\nmen, each taken by the shoulders and pushed and shoved by a roundabout\r\nway to a dark inner staircase, where we emerged into the light on some\r\nroofs.\r\n\r\nThey wanted us to stay where we were, but not wishing to remain without\r\nconveniences, we succeeded in getting between them and the door, and then\r\nfound our way out of the building and rejoined our servants and our\r\nbaggage on the beach. We flourished our letter to Wali Suleiman in his\r\nface; we expostulated, threatened, and cajoled, and passed a whole\r\nmiserable hour by the shore, seated on our belongings under the blazing\r\nafternoon sun, watching our steamer gradually disappearing in the\r\ndistance. Hemmed in by Bedouin, who stared at us as if we had come from\r\nthe moon, exceedingly hot, hungry, and uncomfortable, we passed a very\r\nevil time indeed, speculating as to what would be the result of the\r\nconclave of the old head-men; but at last they approached us in a more\r\nfriendly spirit, begged our pardon, and reinstated us in the fort with\r\nour bag and baggage, and were as civil as they could be. To our dying day\r\nwe shall never know what caused us this dilemma. Did they really think we\r\nhad come to seize their fort (which we afterwards heard was the case),\r\nand interfere with their frankincense monopoly? Or did they think we had\r\ncome to look into the question of a large Arab dhow, which was flying the\r\nFrench flag, and was beached on the shore, and which we had reason to\r\nbelieve was conveying a cargo of slaves to one of the neighbouring\r\nmarkets for disposal? Personally, I suspect the latter was the true\r\nreason of their aversion to our presence, for the coast from here to\r\nMaskat has a bad reputation in this respect, and just lately Arab\r\nslave-dhows have been carrying on their trade under cover of protection\r\nobtained from France at Obok and Zanzibar. The inhabitants have plaited\r\nhair and knobkerries. I believe they belong to the Jenefa tribe.\r\n\r\nFinding Merbat so uncongenial an abode, with no points of interest, and\r\nwith a malarious-looking swamp in its vicinity, and not being able to\r\nobtain camels or escort for a journey inland, we determined only to pass\r\none night there, and after wandering about in search of interests which\r\ndid not exist, we came to terms with the captain of a most filthy baggala\r\nto take us along the coast to Al Hafa, the residence of Wali Suleiman,\r\nwithout whose direct assistance we plainly saw that nothing could be done\r\nabout extending our expedition into the interior. It was only forty miles\r\nto Al Hafa, but, owing to adverse winds, it took us exactly two days to\r\nperform this voyage, and our boat was one of the dirtiest of the kind we\r\nhave ever travelled on. In our little cabin in the stern the smell of\r\nbilge-water was almost overpowering, and every silver thing we had about\r\nus turned black with the sulphureous vapours. These pungent odours were\r\nrelieved from time to time by burning huge chafing dishes of\r\nfrankincense, a large cargo of which was aboard for transport to Bombay\r\nafter we had been deposited at Al Hafa. One of the many songs our sailors\r\nsang when changing the flapping sails was about frankincense, so we tried\r\nto imagine that we were having a pleasant experience of the country we\r\nwere about to visit; and even in its dirt and squalor an Arab dhow is a\r\npicturesque abode, with its pretty carvings and odd-shaped bulwarks. We\r\nwere twenty-five souls on board, and our captain and his crew being\r\ndevout Mohammedans, we had plenty of time and opportunity for studying\r\ntheir numerous prayers and ablutions.\r\n\r\nThe plain of Dhofar, along which we were now coasting, is quite an\r\nabnormal feature in this arid coast. It is the only fertile stretch\r\nbetween Aden and Maskat. It is formed of alluvial soil washed down from\r\nthe Gara mountains; there is abundance of water very near the surface,\r\nand frequent streams make their way down to the sea, so that it is green.\r\nThe great drawback to the country is the want of harbours; during the\r\nnorth-east monsoons dhows can find shelter at Merbat, and during the\r\nsouth-west monsoons at Risout, but the rest of the coast is provided with\r\nnothing but open roadsteads, with the surf always rolling in from the\r\nIndian Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe plain is never more than nine miles wide, and at the eastern end,\r\nwhere the mountains were nearer to the sea, it is reduced to a very\r\nnarrow strip, a grand exception to the long line of barren waste which\r\nforms the Arabian frontage to the Indian Ocean, and which gets narrower\r\nand narrower as the mountains approach the sea at Saihut. Tall cocoanut\r\npalms adorn it in clusters, and long stretches of bright green fields\r\nrefresh the eye; and, at frequent intervals, we saw flourishing villages\r\nby the coast. Tobacco, cotton, Indian corn, and various species of grain\r\ngrow here in great abundance, and in the gardens we find many of the\r\nproducts of India flourishing, viz. the plantain, the papya, mulberries,\r\nmelons, chillis, brinjols, and fruits and vegetables of various\r\ndescriptions. We anchored for some hours off one of these villages, and\r\npaid our toll of dates to the Bedouin who came off to claim them, as is\r\ncustomary all along this coast, every dhow paying this toll in return for\r\nthe privilege of obtaining water when they want it.\r\n\r\nThe Gara mountains are now one of the wildest spots in wild Arabia; owing\r\nto the disastrous blood feuds amongst the tribe and the insecurity of\r\ntravel, they had never previously been penetrated by Europeans: all that\r\nwas known of the district was the actual coast-line. Exciting rumours had\r\nreached the ears of Colonel Miles, a former political agent at Maskat,\r\nconcerning lakes and streams, and fertility unwonted for Arabia, which\r\nexisted in these mountains, and our appetites were consequently whetted\r\nfor their discovery.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times this was one of the chief sources of the time-honoured\r\nfrankincense trade, which still maintains itself here even more than in\r\nthe Hadhramout. It is carried on by the Bedouin of the Gara tribe, who\r\nbring down the odoriferous gum from the mountains on camels. About 9,000\r\ncwt. of it is exported to Bombay annually. Down by the coast at Al Hafa\r\nthere is a square enclosure or bazaar where piles of frankincense may\r\nstill be seen ready for exportation, miniature successors of those piles\r\nof the tears of gum from the tree-trunks which are depicted on the old\r\nEgyptian temple at Deir al Bahari as one of the proceeds of Queen\r\nHatasou's expeditions to the land of Punt.\r\n\r\nThe actual libaniferous country is, perhaps, now not much bigger than the\r\nIsle of Wight, and in its physical appearance not unlike it, cut off from\r\nthe rest of the world by a desert behind and an ocean in front. Probably\r\nin ancient days the frankincense-bearing area was not much more\r\nextensive. Claudius Ptolemy, the anonymous author of the 'Periplus,'\r\nPliny, Theophrastus, and a little later on the Arabian geographers, speak\r\nof it, and from their descriptions there is no difficulty in fixing the\r\nlimits of it, and its ruined towns are still easily identified.\r\n\r\nAfter much tacking and flapping of sails we at last reached Al Hafa,\r\nwhere Wali Suleiman had his castle, only a stone's throw from the beach.\r\nOur landing was performed in small, hide-covered boats specially\r\nconstructed for riding over the surf, and was not completed without a\r\nconsiderable wetting to ourselves and baggage. After so many preliminary\r\ndiscomforts a cordial welcome from the wali was doubly agreeable. He\r\nplaced a room on the roof, spread with carpets, at our disposal, and he\r\nfurnished our larder with a whole cow, and every delicacy at his command.\r\nThe cow's flesh was cut into strips and festooned about in every\r\ndirection, to dry it for our journey. Our room was, for Arabia,\r\ndeliciously cool and airy, being approached by a ladder, and from our\r\nroof we enjoyed pleasant views over the fertile plain and the Gara\r\nmountains, into which we had now every hope of penetrating. We looked\r\ndown into his courtyard below and saw there many interesting phases of\r\nArab life.\r\n\r\nAl Hafa is 640 miles from Maskat in one direction and 800 from Aden in\r\nthe other; it is, therefore, about as far as possible from any civilised\r\nplace. Nominally it is under the sultan of Oman, and I may here\r\nemphatically state that the southern coast of Arabia has absolutely\r\nnothing to do with Turkey--from Maskat to Aden there is not a single\r\ntribe paying tribute to, or having any communication with, the Ottoman\r\nPorte. Really Al Hafa and the Dhofar were ruled over autocratically by\r\nWali Suleiman, who was sent out there about eighteen years before as\r\ngovernor, at the request of the feud-torn inhabitants, by Sultan Tourki\r\nof Maskat. In his small way Wali Suleiman was a man of great capacity; a\r\nman who has made history, and could have made more if his sphere had been\r\nlarger. In his youth he was instrumental in placing Tourki on the throne\r\nof Oman, and after a few years of stern application to business he\r\nbrought the bellicose families of the Gara tribe under his power; and his\r\ninfluence was felt far into the interior, even into the confines of Nejd.\r\nWith a handful of Arabs and a badly armed regiment of slave origin he had\r\ncontrived to establish peace and comparative safety throughout the Gara\r\nmountains and, thanks to him, we were able to penetrate their fastnesses.\r\nWali Suleiman was a stern, uncompromising ruler, feared and respected,\r\nrather than loved.\r\n\r\nThe wali kept all his prisoners in the courtyard. When we were there he\r\nhad twelve, all manacled, and reposing on grass mats at night. These were\r\nwicked Bedouin from the mountains, prisoners taken in a recent war he had\r\nhad with the Mahri tribe, the _casus belli_ being a find of ambergris\r\nwhich the Mahri had appropriated, though it had been washed up on the\r\nDhofar coast. One prisoner, a murderer, whose imprisonment was for two\r\nyears, was chained to a log of wood, and he laid his mat bed in a large\r\nstone sarcophagus, brought from the neighbouring ruins of the ancient\r\ncapital of the frankincense country, and really intended for a trough.\r\nAnother, convicted of stealing his master's sword and selling it to the\r\ncaptain of a dhow, had his feet attached to an iron bar, which made his\r\nlocomotion exceedingly painful. A mollah prisoner was, owing to the\r\nsanctity of his calling, unfettered, and he led the evening prayers, and\r\non most nights--for want of something better to do, I suppose--these\r\nprisoners of Wali Suleiman prayed and sang into the small hours of the\r\nmorning. Day by day we watched these unfortunate men from the roof, and\r\nthought we had never seen so unholy a set of men, according to what we\r\nheard; they did not look so. Some were morose, and chewed the cud of\r\ntheir discontent in corners; the younger and better-looking ones were\r\ngallant, and flirted with the slave girls, helping them to draw up\r\nbuckets from the well in the centre of the courtyard; the active-minded\r\ncut wood for the household, and walked about doing odd jobs, holding up\r\nthe iron bar which separated their feet with a rope as they shuffled\r\nalong, or played with the wali's little boy, five years of age, who\r\nrambled about among them.\r\n\r\nGoats, kids, cocks, and hens, also occupied this courtyard, and the big,\r\nwhite she-ass, the only representative of the equine race as far as we\r\ncould see in Dhofar, on which Wali Suleiman makes his state journeys to\r\nthe various villages in his dominions along the coast, and which he\r\nkindly lent to me once when we went to visit the ruins.\r\n\r\nThe ladies of the wali's harem paid me frequent visits, and brought me\r\npresents of fruit and embarrassing plates of food, and substances to dye\r\nmy teeth red (tamboul leaves and lime), but they were uninteresting\r\nladies, and their conversational powers limited to the discussion of the\r\ntexture of dresses and the merits of European underclothing. On the very\r\nfirst morning they appeared before I was up--that is about sunrise. As I\r\nhad put them off the evening before, I dared not do so again. My husband\r\nsprang out of his bed and got out of their way. I managed to put on a\r\njacket sitting up in bed, and then, finding time allowed, a skirt, and\r\nhad just got my hair combed down when in they trooped. I knew my shoes\r\nand stockings would never be missed, so I felt quite ready for the visit.\r\nThey wore _bourkos_ on their faces, and had on a great deal of coarse\r\njewellery with mock pearls and bad turquoises. Whenever they chose to\r\ncome my husband had to depart, and I do not think he liked these\r\ninterruptions.\r\n\r\nWe were much interested in the male members of the wali's family. His\r\neldest son was paralysed and bedridden, and he had adopted as heir to his\r\nposition in Dhofar a nephew, who lived in a separate wing of the castle,\r\nand had his separate harem establishment. Besides these the wali had two\r\ndear little boys, one of twelve and the other of eight, who constantly\r\npaid us visits, and with whom we established a close friendship. Salem,\r\nthe elder, was a fair, delicate-looking boy, the son of a Georgian slave\r\nwho was given to Wali Suleiman by Sultan Tourki of Oman. Some years ago\r\nshe ran away with her boy to Bombay, but was restored to her husband, and\r\nnow has been sent as a punishment to Zanzibar; she is a servant in the\r\nhouse of one of the princesses there. Salem would often tell us that his\r\nmother was coming back to him in a year or two, but we thought\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\nThe tragedy connected with little Muoffok, the younger boy, a bright,\r\ndear little fellow, very much darker than his brother, in fact nearly\r\nblack, is far more heartrending. About two years before, his mother, also\r\na slave, an African, was convicted of misconduct, and on her was visited\r\nthe extremest penalty with which the Arab law can punish a faithless\r\nwife. In the presence of a large assemblage, the unfortunate woman was\r\nburied up to the waist in the sand and stoned to death.\r\n\r\nThe poor little motherless fellows were constantly on the go, rushing\r\nhither and thither, playing with and petted by all; at one time they\r\namused themselves with the prisoners in the courtyard, at another time\r\nthey teased the Gara sheikhs who sat in the long entrance corridor, and\r\nthen they came to torment us, until we gave then some trifle, which they\r\nforthwith carried off in triumph to show it to everybody. Both the little\r\nboys wore the large silver and gold daggers of Oman round their waists,\r\nand powder-flasks similarly decorated hung on their backs; and when\r\ndressed in their best silk robes on Friday, they were the most fantastic\r\nlittle fellows one could wish to see.\r\n\r\nWali Suleiman was, as I have said, an austere and unlovable man, but he\r\nwas the man for his position: taciturn and of few words, but these always\r\nto the point. Before he would permit us to go forth and penetrate into\r\nthe recesses of the Gara mountains, he summoned the heads of all the\r\ndifferent families into which the tribe is divided to Al Hafa, and gave\r\nus into their charge, we agreeing to pay for their escort, their\r\nprotection, and the use of their camels a fixed sum _per diem_ in Maria\r\nTheresa dollars, the only coin recognised in the country.\r\n\r\nSuch palavering there was over this stupendous piece of diplomacy! Wali\r\nSuleiman and the Gara sheikhs sat for hours in solemn conclave in a\r\npalm-thatched barn about fifty yards distant from the castle, which takes\r\nthe place of a parliament house in the kingdom of Dhofar. The wali, his\r\nnephew, and Arab councillors smoked their _narghilehs_ complacently,\r\nwhilst the Gara Bedouin took whiffs at their little pipes, which they cut\r\nout of soft limestone that hardens in the air, and all drank endless cups\r\nof coffee served by slaves in huge coffee-pots with long, bird-like\r\nbeaks, and we looked on at this conference, which was to decide our fate,\r\nfrom our roof, with no small amount of impatience.\r\n\r\nBefore starting for the mountains we wandered hither and thither over the\r\nplain of Dhofar for some days, visiting sites of ruins, and other places\r\nof interest, and greatly admired the rich cultivation we saw around us,\r\nand the capacity of this plain for producing cotton, indigo, tobacco, and\r\ncereals. Water is on the surface in stagnant pools, or easily obtainable\r\neverywhere by digging shallow wells which are worked by camels, sometimes\r\nthree together, and so well trained, that at the end of the walk they\r\nturn by themselves as soon as they hear the splash of the water into the\r\nirrigation channel, and then they walk back to fill the skin bucket\r\nagain. The cocoanut-palm grows admirably here, and we had many refreshing\r\ndraughts of the water contained in the nuts during our hot rides; and in\r\npools beneath the trees the fibre of the nuts is placed to rot for making\r\nropes, giving out an odour very similar to that of the flax-pits in the\r\nnorth of Ireland.\r\n\r\nBetween Capes Risout and Merbat we found the sites of ruined towns of\r\nconsiderable extent in no less than seven different points, though at the\r\ntwo capes where now is the only anchorage, there are no ruins to be seen,\r\nproving, as we afterwards verified for ourselves, that anchorage of a\r\nsuperior nature existed in the neighbourhood in antiquity, which has\r\nsince become silted up, but which anciently must have afforded ample\r\nprotection for the boats which came for the frankincense trade. At Takha,\r\nas we shall presently see, there was a very extensive and deep harbour,\r\nrunning a considerable distance inland, which with a little outlay of\r\ncapital could easily be restored.\r\n\r\nAfter a close examination of these ruined sites, there can be no doubt\r\nthat those at spots called now Al Balad and Robat, about two miles east\r\nof the wali's residence, formed the ancient capital of this district. We\r\nvisited them on Christmas Day, and were much struck with their extent.\r\nThe chief ruins, those of Al Balad, are by the sea, around an acropolis\r\nsome 100 feet in height. This part of the town was encircled by a moat\r\nstill full of water, and in the centre, still connected with the sea, but\r\nalmost silted up, is a tiny harbour. The ground is covered with the\r\nremains of Mohammedan mosques, and still more ancient Sabæan temples, the\r\narchitecture of which--namely, the square columns with flutings at the\r\nfour corners, and the step-like capitals--at once connects them\r\narchitecturally with the columns at Adulis on the Red Sea, those of\r\nKoloe and Aksum in Abyssinia, and those described by M. Arnaud at Mariaba\r\nin Yemen.\r\n\r\nIn some cases these are decorated with intricate patterns, one of which\r\nis formed by the old Sabæan letters [Symbol: circle with dot in middle]\r\nand X, which may possibly have some religious import. After seeing the\r\nruins of Adulis and Koloe and the numerous temples or tombs with four\r\nisolated columns, no doubt can be entertained that the same people built\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs at Adulis and Koloe there were no inscriptions which could materially\r\nassist us; this may be partly accounted for by the subsequent Mohammedan\r\noccupation, when the temples were converted into mosques, but besides\r\nthis the nature of the stone employed at all these places would make it\r\nvery difficult to use it for inscribing letters: it is very coarse, and\r\nfull of enormous fossils.\r\n\r\nThis town of Al Balad by the sea is connected by a series of ruins with\r\nanother town two miles inland, now called Robat, where the ground for\r\nmany acres is covered with ancient remains; big cisterns and\r\nwater-courses are here cut in the rock, and standing columns of the same\r\narchitectural features are seen in every direction.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of Sprenger's 'Alte Geographie Arabiens,' the best\r\nguide-book the traveller can take into this country, there is no\r\ndifficulty in identifying this ancient capital of the frankincense\r\ncountry as the Manteion Artemidos of Claudius Ptolemy. This name\r\nis obviously a Greek translation of the Sabæan for some well-known oracle\r\nwhich anciently existed here, not far, as Ptolemy himself tells us, from\r\nCape Risout. This name eventually became Zufar, from which the modern\r\nname of Dhofar is derived. In a.d. 618 the town was destroyed and Mansura\r\nbuilt, under which name the capital was known in early Mohammedan times.\r\nVarious Arab geographers also assist us in this identification. Yakut,\r\nfor example, tells us how the Prince of Zufar had the monopoly of the\r\nfrankincense trade, and punished with death any infringement of it. Ibn\r\nBatuta says that 'half a day's journey east of Mensura is Alakhaf, the\r\nabode of the Addites,' probably referring to the site of the oracle and\r\nthe last stronghold of the ancient cult.\r\n\r\nSprenger sums up the evidence of old writers by saying that the town of\r\nZufar and the later Mansura must undoubtedly be the ruins of Al Balad.\r\nThus, having assured ourselves of the locality of the ancient capital of\r\nthe frankincense country--for no other site along the plain has ruins\r\nwhich will at all compare in extent and appearance with those of Al\r\nBalad--we shall, as we proceed on our journey, find that other sites fall\r\neasily into their proper places, and an important verification of ancient\r\ngeography and an old-world centre of commerce has been obtained.\r\n\r\nThe ruins at Al Balad and Robat were last inhabited during the Persian\r\noccupation, about the time of the Crusades, 500 of the Hejira. They\r\nutilised the old Himyaritic columns to build their mosques. Some of the\r\ntombs have beautiful carving on them.\r\n\r\nIn the ruins of one temple the columns were elaborately carved with a\r\nkind of _fleur-de-lis_ pattern, and the bases decorated with a floral\r\ndesign, artistically interwoven.\r\n\r\nI had dreadful difficulty with a photograph which I took of these\r\ncolumns. I developed it at night, tormented by mosquitoes, and in the\r\nmorning it was all cracked and dried off its celluloid foundation. I put\r\nit in alum, and it floated off half an inch too large in both directions.\r\nIf I had had a larger plate on which to mount it, it would have been an\r\neasy enough job, but I had not, so I was obliged to work it down on to\r\nthe original plate with my thumbs. It took me seven solid hours, and I\r\nhad to be fed with two meals, for I could never move my thumbs nor eyes\r\noff my work. I felt very proud that the cracks did not show when a\r\nmagic-lantern slide was made from it.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of vegetation among the ruins. Specially beautiful\r\nwas a very luxuriant creeper called by the inhabitants _asaleb_. It has a\r\nluscious, large, pear-shaped red fruit with seeds which, when bitten, are\r\nlike pepper. It has large flowers, which are white at first, and then\r\nturn pink.\r\n\r\nOn our way home from Al Balad we stopped to rest under some cocoa-palms,\r\nand stones and other missiles were flung up by our guides, so the\r\ncocoanuts came showering down in rather a terrifying way. The men then\r\nstuck their _ghatrifs_ in the ground and banged the nuts on them, and\r\nthus skinned them. Then they hacked at them with their swords till they\r\ncut off the tops like eggs, and we enjoyed a good drink of the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE GARA TRIBE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Al Hafa on December 29, after waiting six days for camels. There\r\nwas much difficulty in getting a sufficient quantity, and never before\r\nhad camels been hired in this manner. It was hard to make the people\r\nunderstand what we meant or wished to do.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the camels were assembled, they arrived naked and bare.\r\nThere were no ropes of any kind, or sticks to tie the baggage to, no\r\nvestige of any sort of pack saddle, and we had to wait till the following\r\nday before a few ropes could be procured. A good many of our spare\r\nblankets had to be used as saddle-cloths, that is to say under the\r\nbaggage; ropes off our boxes, straps, raw-hide _riems_ that we had used\r\nin South Africa, and in fact every available string had to be used to tie\r\nit on, and the Bedouin even took the strings which they wear as fillets\r\nround their hair, to tie round the camels' necks and noses to lead them.\r\n\r\nThere was great confusion over the loading, as all that ever yet had been\r\ndone to camels in that country was to tie a couple of sacks of\r\nfrankincense together and hang them on. The camels roared incessantly,\r\ngot up before they were ready, shook off their loads, would not kneel\r\ndown or ran away loaded, shedding everything or dragging things at their\r\nheels. Sometimes their masters quite left off their work to quarrel\r\namongst themselves, bawling and shouting. Though we were ready at seven,\r\nit was after midday before we were off, though Wali Suleiman himself\r\nsuperintended the loading.\r\n\r\nCamels in Dhofar are not very choice feeders, and have a predilection for\r\nbones, and if they saw a bone near the path they would make for it with\r\nan eager rush extremely disconcerting to the rider. Fish, too, is dried\r\nfor them and given them as food (called _kei_ by the Gara and _ohma_ by\r\nthe Arabs), as also is a cactus which grows in the mountains, which is\r\ncut into sections for them. They are fine sturdy animals, and can go up\r\nand down hill better than any camels I have ever seen. The fertile Gara\r\nrange is a great breeding place for camels, but as there is no commerce\r\nor communication with the interior, the Bedouin do not make much use of\r\nthem themselves, but sell them to their neighbours, who come here to\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nMy husband, Imam Sherif and I had each a seat on a separate loaded camel,\r\nwith our _rezais_ or _lahafs_--thick cotton quilts--on the baggage; six\r\nof the servants rode in pairs while one walked, all taking turns. We went\r\nabout eight miles westward the first day and considered it a wonderfully\r\ngood journey. We stopped at the edge of the plain, about half a mile from\r\nthe sea at Ras Risout, where some very dirty water was to be obtained\r\nunder a rock.\r\n\r\nWe passed some ruins with columns four miles west of Al Hafa at Aukad.\r\n\r\nThe approach to the mountains is up narrow gulleys full of\r\nfrankincense-trees.\r\n\r\nWe had a stormy and quarrelsome start next day, after a delay caused by\r\nmy husband's camel sitting down constantly and unexpectedly, and a\r\nstoppage because two possible enemies being descried it was deemed\r\nneedful to wait till all the camels came up that we might keep together.\r\nWhen they arrived we waited so long that we got up, told them that we did\r\nnot want to be kept all day on the road, and began to mount our camels,\r\nsaying we would return to the wali at Al Hafa. In the end they began\r\nquarrelling with each other and made peace with us, and next we set off\r\nto a place farther north than they had before intended, where there was\r\ngood water in a small amphitheatre of mountains. We went up a lovely\r\ngorge with ferns, trees, and a running stream, as different as possible\r\nto the aridity of the Hadhramout.\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1895, began with a wild-goose chase after some ruins\r\nconsisting of a circular wall of loose stones about a foot in height,\r\nvery likely only a sheep pen.\r\n\r\nThe camels were much quieter and the Bedouin very friendly. We only\r\ntravelled an hour and a half, having gone round some spurs and found\r\nourselves in a round valley, back to back with that we had left, and\r\nabout half a mile distant from our last camp. It was surrounded by some\r\nvery high and some lower hills, and we were just under a beetling cliff\r\nwith good water in a stream among bulrushes, reeds, and tropical\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nThere was a Bedou family close by with goats; they sold us milk at an\r\nexorbitant price and asked so much for a kid that we stuck to our tinned\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nThe Gara, in whose country we were now, are a wild pastoral tribe of the\r\nmountains, travelling over them hither and thither in search of food for\r\ntheir flocks. They are troglodytes of a genuine kind and know no home\r\nsave their ancestral caves, with which this limestone range abounds; they\r\nonly live in rude reed huts like ant hills, when they come down to the\r\nplain of Dhofar in the rainy season for pasturage. There is a curious\r\nstory connected with the Gara tribe, which probably makes them unique in\r\nArabia, and that is, that a few years ago they owned a white sheikh.\r\nAbout the beginning of this century an American ship was wrecked on this\r\ncoast, and all the occupants were killed save the cabin boy, who was kept\r\nas a slave. As years went on his superior ability asserted itself, and\r\ngained for him in his later years the proud position of sheikh of all\r\nthe Garas. He lived, married, and died amongst them, leaving, I believe,\r\ntwo daughters, who still live up in the mountains with their tribe. The\r\nlife and adventures of this Yankee boy must have been as thrilling and\r\ninteresting as any novelist could desire, and it is a great pity that the\r\nwhite sheikh could not have been personally interviewed before his death,\r\nwhich occurred over twenty years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GARA FORGE]\r\n\r\nSprenger (§ 449) supposes that the tribal name Gara or Kara corresponds\r\nto the ancient Ascites whom Ptolemy places on this coast; but as the\r\nAscites were essentially a seafaring race, and the Gara are a pastoral\r\ntribe of hill Bedouin, the connection between them does not seem very\r\nobvious. It is more probable that they may correspond to the Carrei\r\nmentioned in the campaign of Aelius Gallus as a race of Southern Arabia,\r\npossessing, according to Pliny, the most fertile country.\r\n\r\nAs for weapons, the Gara have three, and every male of the tribe carries\r\nthem. One is a small shield (_gohb_) of wood or shark's skin, deep, and\r\nwith a wooden knob at the centre, so that when they are tired and want a\r\nrest they can turn it round and utilise it as a stool; the second is a\r\nflat iron sword with a wooden handle, actually made in Germany, for we\r\nsaw a dhow arrive from Zanzibar whilst we were at Dhofar which brought a\r\ncargo of such swords; the Bedouin purchased them with avidity, and were\r\nlike children with a new toy for some time after, bending them across\r\ntheir naked shoulders, and measuring them with their neighbours, to see\r\nthat they were all equally long; handing them safely about by their\r\nblades. These swords are simply flat pieces of iron, made narrower at the\r\ntop to leave a place for the hand to grip them; there is no form of hilt\r\nof any kind. They are used to cut down trees, split logs, scrape sticks,\r\nand cut meat into joints. They have scabbards covered with white calico,\r\nwhich are not always used, and there are no straps to attach the sword to\r\nthe person. The third weapon is a wooden throw-stick, made of a specially\r\nhard wood called _miet_, which grows in the mountains; it is about a yard\r\nlong, and pointed at both ends; it is called _ghatrif_. The Gara are\r\nwonderfully skilful at hurling it through the air, and use it both in\r\nbattle and for the chase with admirable precision. They have hardly any\r\nguns amongst them, and what they have are only of the long matchlock\r\nclass; in fact, they do not seem to covet the possession of firearms, as\r\nour friends in the Hadhramout did the year before. Every man clutched the\r\nsword and ghatrif in one hand very tightly as there was nothing to\r\nprevent their slipping, being both pointed.\r\n\r\nThe little pipes which they use are of limestone, soft when cut and\r\nhardening in the air. They are more like cigarette holders than pipes.\r\n\r\nThe thorn-extractors used by the Gara tribe are like those used by most\r\nof the other Bedouin: a knife, a sort of stiletto, and tweezers. They sit\r\ndown on the wayside and hack most heartily at their feet, and then prod\r\ndeeply with the stiletto before pulling the thorn out with the tweezers.\r\n\r\nCertainly black skins are not so sensitive as white, and though, of\r\ncourse, I do not approve of slavery, I do think a great deal of unneeded\r\npity has been wasted on slaves by people who took it for granted that\r\nbeing men and brothers they had the same feelings as ourselves, either in\r\nmind or body. No one with the same feelings as we could go so readily\r\nthrough the burning cure (_kayya_). In Mashonaland I have seen people\r\nwalking on narrow paths only suited to people who have never learnt to\r\nturn out their toes, all overhung with thorny bushes which not only tore\r\nour clothes but our skins. The black people only had white scratches as\r\nif they were made of morocco leather. If by any chance a knock really\r\nbrought a bit of flesh or skin off, and blood annoyed them by streaming\r\ndown, they would clutch up a handful of grass with a dry leaf or stick,\r\nand wipe the wound out quite roughly.\r\n\r\nWe had never put ourselves into the charge of such wild people as the\r\nGaras--far wilder in every way than the Bedouin of the Hadhramout,\r\ninasmuch as they have far less contact with civilisation. The Bedou of\r\nSouthern Arabia is, to my mind, distinctly of an aboriginal race. He has\r\nnothing to do with the Arabs, and was probably there just as he is now,\r\ncenturies before the Arabs found a footing in this country. He is every\r\nbit as wild as the African savage, and not nearly so submissive to\r\ndiscipline, and is endowed with a spirit of independence which makes him\r\nresent the slightest approach to legal supervision.\r\n\r\nWhen once away from the influence of Wali Suleiman, they paid no heed to\r\nthe orders of the soldiers sent by him, and during the time we were with\r\nthem we had the unpleasant feeling that we were entirely in their power.\r\nThey would not march longer than they liked; they would only take us\r\nwhere they wished, and they were unpleasantly familiar; with difficulty\r\nwe kept them out of our tents, and if we asked them not to sing at night\r\nand disturb our rest, they always set to work with greater vigour.\r\n\r\nSeventeen of these men, nearly naked, armed as I have described, and\r\nwild-looking in the extreme, formed our bodyguard, and if we attempted to\r\ngive an order which did not please them, they would independently reply,\r\n'We are all sheikhs, we are not slaves.' At the same time they paid the\r\ngreatest deference to their chief, the old Sheikh Sehel, and expected us\r\nto do the same.\r\n\r\nSheikh Sehel was the head of the Beit al Kathan, which is the chief of\r\nthe many families into which the Gara tribe is divided, and consequently\r\nhe was recognised as the chief of all the Garas. He was a wizened, very\r\navaricious-looking old man, who must have been close upon seventy, and\r\nthough he owned 500 head of cattle and 70 camels, he dressed his old\r\nbones in nothing save a loin-cloth, and his matted grey locks were\r\nadorned and kept together by a simple leather thong twisted several times\r\nround his forehead. Despite his appearance he was a great man in his\r\nlimited sphere, and for the weeks that were to come we were completely in\r\nhis power.\r\n\r\nHe had the exclusive charge of me and my camel, which he led straight\r\nthrough everything, regardless of the fact that I was on several\r\noccasions nearly knocked off by the branches of trees; and if my seat was\r\nuncomfortable, which it often was, as well as precarious--for we all sat\r\non luggage indifferently tied on--we had the greatest work to make Sheikh\r\nSehel stop to rectify the discomfort, for he was the sheikh of all the\r\nGaras, as he constantly repeated, and his dignity was not to be trifled\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nThe seventeen sheikhs got half a dollar a day each for food, their slaves\r\na quarter.\r\n\r\nOur expedition nearly came to an untimely end a very few days after our\r\nstart, owing, as my husband himself confessed, to a little indiscretion\r\non his part; but as the event serves to illustrate the condition of the\r\nmen we were with, I must not fail to recount it. During our day's march\r\nwe met with a large company of the Al Khathan family pasturing their\r\nflocks and herds in a pleasant valley. Great greetings took place, and\r\nour men carried off two goats for an evening feast. When night approached\r\nthey lit a fire of wood, and piled stones on the embers so as to form a\r\nheated surface. On this they placed the meat, cut in strips with their\r\nswords, the entrails, the heads, and every part of the animal, until\r\ntheir kitchen looked like a ghastly sacrifice to appease the anger of\r\nsome deity. I must confess that the smell thereof was exceeding savoury,\r\nand the picture presented by these hungry savages, gathered round the\r\nlurid light of their kitchen, was weird in the extreme. Daggers were used\r\nfor knives, two fingers for forks, and we stood at a respectful distance\r\nand watched them gorge; and so excited did they become as they consumed\r\nthe flesh, that one could almost have supposed them to be under the\r\ninfluence of strong drink. Several friends joined them from the\r\nneighbouring hills, and far into the night they carried on their wild\r\norgy, singing, shouting, and periodically letting off the guns which the\r\nsoldiers sent by Wali Suleiman brought with them.\r\n\r\nWe retired in due course to our tent and our beds, but not to sleep, for\r\nin addition to their discordant songs, in rushing to and fro they would\r\ncatch in our tent-guys, and give us sudden shocks, which rendered sleep\r\nimpossible. Exasperated at this beyond all bearing, my husband at length\r\nrushed out and caught a Bedou in the very act of tumbling over a guy.\r\nNeedless to say a well-placed kick sent him quickly about his business,\r\nand after this silence was established and we got some repose.\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, when we were prepared to start, we found our\r\nBedouin all seated in a silent, solemn phalanx, refusing to move. 'What\r\nis the matter?' my husband asked, 'why are we not ready to start?' and\r\nfrom amongst them arose a stern, freezing reply. 'You must return to Al\r\nHafa. We can travel no more with you, as Theodore has kicked Sheikh\r\nSehel,' for by this time they had become acquainted with our Christian\r\nnames, and never used any other appellative.\r\n\r\nWe felt that the aspect of affairs was serious, and that in the night\r\nseason he had been guilty of an indiscretion which might imperil both our\r\nsafety and the farther progress of our journey. So we affected to take\r\nthe matter as a joke, laughed heartily, patted Sheikh Sehel on the back,\r\nsaid that we did not know who it was, and my husband entered into a\r\nsolemn compact that if they would not catch in our guys again, he would\r\nnever kick his majesty any more. It was surprising to see how soon the\r\nglum faces relaxed, and how soon all ill-feeling was forgotten. In a very\r\nfew minutes life and bustle, chattering and good humour reigned in our\r\ncamp, and we were excellent friends again.\r\n\r\nIt was on the third day after leaving Al Hafa that we passed through one\r\nof the districts where frankincense is still collected, in a narrow\r\nvalley running down from the mountains into the plain of Dhofar. The\r\nvalley was covered for miles with this shrub, the trunk of which, when\r\npunctured, emits the odoriferous gum. We did not see any very large\r\ntrees, such as we did in Sokotra. The Bedouin choose the hot season, when\r\nthe gum flows most freely, to do this puncturing. During the rains of\r\nJuly and August, and during the cool season, the trees are left alone.\r\nThe first step is to make an incision in the trunk, then they strip off a\r\nnarrow bit of bark below the hole, so as to make a receptacle in which\r\nthe milky juice, the _spuma pinguis_ of Pliny, can lodge and harden. Then\r\nthe incision is deepened, and after seven days they return to collect\r\nwhat are, by that time, quite big tears of frankincense, larger than an\r\negg.\r\n\r\nThe shrub itself is a picturesque one, with a leaf not unlike an ash,\r\nonly stiffer; it has a tiny green flower, not red like the Sokotra\r\nflowers, and a scaly bark. In all there are three districts in the Gara\r\nmountains where the tree still grows; anciently, no doubt, it was found\r\nin much larger quantities, but the demand for frankincense is now so very\r\nlimited that they take no care whatever of the trees. They only tap the\r\nmost promising ones, and those that grow farther west in the Mahri\r\ncountry, as they produce an inferior quality, are not now tapped at all.\r\n\r\nThe best is obtained at spots called Hoye and Haski, about four days'\r\njourney inland from Merbat, where the Gara mountains slope down into the\r\nNejd desert. The second in quality comes from near Cape Risout, and also\r\na little farther west, at a place called Chisen, near Rakhiout,\r\nfrankincense of a marketable quality is obtained, but that farther west\r\nin the Mahri country is not collected now, being much inferior. The best\r\nquality they call _leban lakt_, and the second quality _leban resimi_,\r\nand about 9,000 cwt. are exported yearly and sent to Bombay. It is only\r\ncollected in the hot weather, before the rains begin and when the gum\r\nflows freely, in the months of March, April, and May, for during the\r\nrains the tracks on the Gara mountains are impassable. The trees belong\r\nto the various families of the Gara tribe; each tree is marked and known\r\nto its owner, and the product is sold wholesale to Banyan merchants, who\r\ncome to Dhofar just before the monsoons to take it away.\r\n\r\nOne must imagine that when this industry was at its height, in the days\r\nwhen frankincense was valued not only for temple ritual but for domestic\r\nuse, the trade in these mountains must have been very active, and the\r\ncunning old Sabæan merchants, who liked to keep the monopoly of this\r\ndrug, told wonderful stories of the phoenix which guarded the trees, of\r\nthe insalubrity of the climate and of the deadly vapours which came from\r\nthem when punctured for the gum. Needless to say, these were all false\r\ncommercial inventions, which apparently succeeded admirably, for the old\r\nclassical authors were exceedingly vague as to the localities whence\r\nfrankincense came. Merchants came in their ships to the port of Moscha,\r\nwhich we shall presently visit, to get cargoes of the drug, but they\r\nprobably knew as little as we did of the interior of the hills behind,\r\nand one of the reasons why Aelius Gallus was sent to Arabia by Augustus\r\non his unsuccessful campaign was 'to discover where Arabian gold and\r\nfrankincense came from.'\r\n\r\nEarly Arabian authors are far more explicit, and we gather from Makrisi,\r\nIbn Khaldun, and others, something more definite about Dhofar and the\r\nfrankincense trade, and of the prince of this district who had the\r\nmonopoly of the trade, and punished its infringement with death. These\r\nwriters, when compared with the classical ones, assist us greatly in\r\nidentifying localities.\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese knew about Dhofar and its productions, for Camoens, in his\r\nTenth Lusiad, 716, writes:\r\n\r\n    'O'er Dhofar's plain the richest incense breathes.'\r\n\r\nBut not until Dr. Carter coasted along here some fifty years ago was it\r\ndefinitely known that this was the chief locality in Arabia which\r\nproduced the drug.\r\n\r\nMyrrh, too, grows in large quantities in the Gara range, and we obtained\r\nspecimens of it in close proximity to the frankincense-tree. The gum of\r\nthe myrrh-tree is much redder than ordinary gum Arabic, whereas the\r\nfrankincense gum is considerably whiter. The commerce of Dhofar must have\r\nbeen exceedingly rich in those ancient days, as is evidenced by the size\r\nand extent of the Sabæan ruins on the plain. They are the most easterly\r\nruins which have been found in Arabia of the Sabæan period, and probably\r\nowe their origin entirely to the drug trade.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days of our journey, we suffered greatly from the\r\nunruliness of the camels. They danced about like wild things at first,\r\nand scattered our belongings far and wide, and all of us in our turns had\r\nserious falls, and during those days, boxes and packages kept flying\r\nabout in all directions. Imam Sharif had his travelling trunk broken to\r\npieces and the contents scattered right and left, and some treasured\r\nobjects of jewellery therein contained were never recovered. So scarce\r\ndid rope become during our journey, that the Bedouin had actually to take\r\nthe leather thongs which bound their matted locks together, to lead the\r\ncamels with, and rope was almost the only thing they tried to steal from\r\nus while we were in their company. At length our means of tying became so\r\nexhausted that we had to send a messenger back to buy rope from Wali\r\nSuleiman, and obtained a large sackful for two reals.\r\n\r\nOur new supply of rope was made of aloe-fibre, barely twisted in one thin\r\nstrand, and at every camp we had to set up a rope-walk to make ropes that\r\nwould not break. The Garas were always cutting off short bits to tie\r\nround their hair or their necks. The servants, headed by Lobo, had to be\r\nvery sharp in picking up all the pieces lying about after unloading, or\r\nwe should soon have been at a loss again.\r\n\r\nWe originally understood that Sheikh Sehel was going to take us up to the\r\nmountains by a valley still farther west, but for some reason, which we\r\nshall never know, he refused; some said the Mahri tribe was giving\r\ntrouble in this direction, others that the road was too difficult for\r\ncamels. At any rate, we had partially to retrace our steps, and following\r\nalong the foot of the mountains, found ourselves encamped not so many\r\nmiles away from Al Hafa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE GARA MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt length we turned our faces towards the Gara mountains, with\r\nconsiderable interest and curiosity, and prepared to ascend them by a\r\ntortuous valley, the Wadi Ghersìd, which dives into their very midst, and\r\nforms the usual approach for camels, as the mountain sides in other parts\r\nare too precipitous. After riding up the valley for a few miles, we came\r\nacross one of the small lakes of which we were in quest, nestling in a\r\nrocky hole, and with its fine boulders hung with ferns and vegetation,\r\nforming altogether one of the most ideal spots we had ever seen. That\r\narid Arabia could produce so lovely a spot, was to us one of the greatest\r\nsurprises of our lives. Water-birds and water-plants were here to be\r\nfound in abundance, and the hill slopes around were decked with fine\r\nsycamores and acacia-trees, amongst the branches of which sweet white\r\njessamine, several species of convolvulus, and other creepers climbed.\r\n\r\nThe water was deliciously cool, rushing forth from three different points\r\nin the rock among maidenhair and other ferns into the basin which formed\r\nthe lake, but it is impregnated with lime, which leaves a deposit all\r\ndown the valley along its course. Evidence of the mighty rush of water\r\nduring the rains is seen on all sides, rubbish is then cast into the\r\nbranches of the great fig-trees, and the Bedouin told us that at times\r\nthis valley is entirely full of water and quite impassable.\r\n\r\nNext day we pursued our way up the gorge of Ghersìd, climbing higher and\r\nhigher, making our way through dense woods, often dangerous for the camel\r\nriders, and obliging us frequently to dismount.\r\n\r\nMerchants who visited Dhofar in pursuit of their trade knew of these\r\nvalleys, and not unnaturally brought home glowing accounts of their\r\nfertility, and thus gained for Arabia a reputation which has been thought\r\nto be exaggerated.\r\n\r\nIn the Wadi Ghersìd, amongst the dense vegetation which makes the spot a\r\nveritable paradise, we came across many Bedouin of the Beit al Kathan\r\nfamily tending their flocks and dwelling in the caves. They were all\r\nexceedingly obsequious to Sheikh Sehel, and we soon found that he was a\r\nveritable king amongst them, and forthwith we gave up any attempt to\r\nguide our own footsteps, but left ourselves entirely in his hands, to\r\ntake us whither he would and spend as long about it as he liked. One\r\nthing which interested us very much was to see the greetings of the\r\nBedouin: for an acquaintance they merely rub the palms of their hands\r\nwhen they meet, and then kiss the tips of their respective fingers; for\r\nan intimate friend they join hands and kiss each other; but for a\r\nrelative they not only join hands, but they rub noses and finally kiss on\r\neither cheek. Whenever we met a party of their friends on our way, it was\r\na signal for a halt that these greetings might be observed, and then\r\nfollowed a pipe. At first we rather resented these halts; but they take\r\nsuch a short time over their whiff of tobacco, and are so disconsolate\r\nwithout it, that we soon gave up complaints at these delays. They\r\nliterally only take one whiff and pass the stone pipe on, so that a halt\r\nfor a smoke seldom lasts more than five minutes, and all are satisfied.\r\nSheikh Sehel met many of his relatives in the Wadi Ghersìd, and his nose\r\nwas subject to many energetic rubs, and the novelty of this greeting,\r\nabout which one had vaguely read in years gone by, excited our interest\r\ndeeply, but at the same time we were thankful we were not likely to meet\r\nany relatives in the valley, and to have to undergo the novel sensations\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon, when our tents were pitched and our baggage open, whole\r\nrows of Bedouin would sit outside asking for medicine; pills, of special\r\nviolence of course, and quinine were the chief drugs required, and then\r\nwe had many sore eyes and revolting sores of every description, requiring\r\ncloser attention. As to the pills, we had some difficulty in getting the\r\nBedouin not to chew them, but when one man, Mas'ah by name, solemnly\r\nchewed five Holloway's pills and was very sick after so doing, it began\r\nto dawn upon them that our method was the right one. Most embarrassing of\r\nall our patients was old Sheikh Sehel himself. Fortune had been kind to\r\nhim in most respects: she had given him wealth and power amongst men, and\r\nthe fickle goddess had bestowed upon him two wives, but alas! no\r\noffspring, and to seek for a remedy for this, to a savage, overwhelming\r\ndisaster, he came with his head-men to the tent of the European medicine\r\nmen. It was in vain for my husband to tell him that he had brought no\r\nremedy for this complaint. They had seen him on one or two occasions\r\nconsult a small medicine book, and their only reply to his negative was,\r\n'The book; get out the book, Theodore,' and he had solemnly to pretend to\r\ngo through the volume before they could be convinced that he had no\r\nmedicine to meet the case.\r\n\r\nIt was curious to hear their morning greeting, 'Sabakh, Theodore! Sabakh,\r\nMabel!' The women of the Gara tribe are timid creatures, small, and not\r\naltogether ill-looking; in fact the Garas are, as a tribe, undersized and\r\nof small limbs, but exceedingly active and lithe. The women do not\r\npossess the wealth in savage jewellery which we found to be the case in\r\nthe Hadhramout the previous year, nor do they paint themselves so\r\ngrotesquely with turmeric and other dyes, but indulge only in a few\r\npatches of black, sticky stuff like cobbler's wax on their faces, and a\r\ntouch of antimony round their eyes and joining their eyebrows; they wear\r\nno veils, and at first we could not get near them, as they ran away in\r\nterror at our approach. They have but poor jewellery--silver necklaces,\r\narmlets, nose, toe, and finger rings. One evening, when up in the\r\nmountains, we were told that a harem wished to see us, and we were\r\nconducted to a spot just out of sight of our tents, where sat three\r\nfemales on the ground looking miserably shy, and in their nervousness\r\nthey plucked and ate grass, and constantly as we approached retreated\r\nthree or four steps back and seated themselves again. Presently, after\r\nmuch persuasion, we got one of them to come to the tent and accept a\r\npresent of needles and other oddments, the delight of womankind all the\r\nworld over. Altogether these Gara women formed a marked and pleasant\r\ncontrast to the Bedouin women in the Hadhramout, who literally besieged\r\nus in our tent, and never gave us any peace.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to read in the 'Periplus' (p. 32) a description of this\r\ncoast and of the high mountains behind, 'where men dwell in holes.' We\r\noften went to visit the troglodytes in their cave homes, where we found\r\nmen, women, and children living with their flocks and herds in happy\r\nharmony. The floor of their caves is soft and springy, the result of the\r\ndeposits of generations of cattle; in the dark recesses of the cave the\r\nkids are kept during their mother's absence at the pasture, and though\r\nthese caves are slightly odoriferous, we found them cool and refreshing\r\nafter the external heat. In some of them huts are erected for the\r\nfamilies, and in one cave we found almost a village of huts; but in the\r\nsmaller ones they have no covering, and when in the open the Gara cares\r\nfor nothing but a tree to shelter him. All their farm implements are of\r\nthe most primitive nature; the churn is just a skin hung on three sticks,\r\nwhich a woman shakes about until she obtains her butter. Ghi or rancid\r\nbutter is one of the chief exports of Dhofar. They practise too, a pious\r\nfraud on their cows by stretching a calf-skin on a stick, and when the\r\ncow licks this she is satisfied and the milk comes freely. They have but\r\nfew pots and pans, and these of the dirtiest description, so when we got\r\nmilk from them we always sent our own utensils.\r\n\r\nIn these valleys, by rocks near the streams and under trees, live, the\r\nBedouin told us, those curious semi-divine spirits which they call\r\n_jinni_, the propitiating of which seems to be the chief form of religion\r\namongst them. One morning, as we were riding up a narrow gorge beneath\r\nthe shade of a beetling cliff, our guides suddenly set up a sing-song\r\nchant, which they continued for fully ten minutes. '_Aleik soubera, Aleik\r\nsoubera_,' were the words which they constantly repeated, and which were\r\naddressed, they told us, to the jinni of the rocks, a supplication to\r\nallow us to pass in safety.\r\n\r\nJinni also inhabit the lakes in the Gara mountains, and it is considered\r\ndangerous to wet your feet in them, for you will catch a fever. We could\r\nnot induce the Bedouin to gather a water-plant we coveted in one of them\r\nfor this reason. They inhabit, too, the caves where the people dwell, and\r\nhave to be propitiated with suitable offerings. In fact, the fear of\r\njinni, and the skill of certain magicians in keeping them friendly, are\r\nthe only tangible form of religion that we could discover amongst them.\r\nWhen at the coast villages they outwardly conform to the Mohammedan\r\ncustoms, but when away in their mountains they abandon them altogether.\r\nDuring the time we were with them they never performed either the prayers\r\nor the ablutions required by the Moslem creed, and the only thing\r\napproaching a religious festival amongst them that we heard of, is an\r\nannual festival held by the Garas in November by the side of one of their\r\nlakes, to which all the members of the different families repair, and at\r\nwhich a magician sits on a rock in the centre of a group of dancing\r\nBedouin, to propitiate, with certain formulas, the jinni of the lake.\r\nAmongst the Bedouin of the Hadhramout we noticed the same absence of\r\nreligious observances and the same superstitious dread of jinni, but at\r\nthe same time I fully believe they have their own sacred places and\r\nfestivals, which they conceal as much as possible from the fanatical\r\nMoslems who dwell amongst them. A Bedouin never fasts during Ramazan, and\r\ndoes not object to do his work during the month of abstinence, but he\r\ngoes to mosque and says his prayers when occasion brings him to the\r\ncoast. It seems to me a curious coincidence that in many other Mohammedan\r\ncountries we have visited we have come across the same story of concealed\r\nreligion as practised by the nomad races. We have the Ali-Ullah-hi in the\r\nPersian mountains, about whose secret rites horrible stories are told; we\r\nhave the Ansairi and the Druses in the Lebanon, and the nomad Yourouks of\r\nAsia Minor, and the Dünmeh of Salonika, about all of whom the strict\r\nMohammedans of the towns tell you exactly the same story that we heard\r\nabout the Bedouin of Southern Arabia. They are all looked upon as heathen\r\nby the Moslems, and accredited with secret rites and ceremonies about\r\nwhich no definite knowledge can be gained; and thus it would seem that\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of Islam there are survivals of more\r\nancient cults which the followers of Mohammed have never been able to\r\neradicate, cults which no doubt would offer points of vast interest to\r\nthe anthropologist if it were possible to unravel the mysteries which\r\nsurround them.\r\n\r\nWe were for ever hearing stories of jinni amongst the Gara Bedouin, and\r\nall we could gather was that when propitiated they are friendly to the\r\nhuman race. Old Sheikh Sehel and his men stuck to it that they had\r\nconstantly seen jinni, and their belief in them seems deeply rooted. This\r\nword is pronounced ghinni in Southern Arabia.\r\n\r\nOn January 4 we were at Beit el Khatan. We had to climb on foot. The\r\nvalley became narrower as we went on, and the cliffs at the side were\r\nfull of long caverns, with great stumpy stalactites and stalagmites,\r\nlooking like teeth in gigantic mouths. The rocks we had to climb up were\r\nvery rough and rugged, but where millions of camels' feet in thousands of\r\nyears had polished them they were quite smooth and slippery. When we got\r\nabove the woods, all very hot, we were able to ride again, at an\r\nelevation of 2,600 feet, on undulating, grassy ground.\r\n\r\nWe encamped under two large fig-trees, and the weather being cloudy and\r\nwindy were glad to find a quantity of wood ready gathered, the remains of\r\na night shelter. There was muddy water at a little distance. The climate\r\nseems most healthy, in winter at least. Three kinds of figs grow here.\r\nSome are little purple ones with narrow leaves, and some large red ones\r\nwith broad leaves.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Wadi Ghersìd we had a beautiful journey. We two enjoyed every\r\nminute of the three hours and a half.\r\n\r\nWe went up the valley through a thick forest of lovely trees. There were\r\nmyrtles, ilex, figs, acacia, and a quantity of other trees, with climbing\r\ncacti and other creepers, and great high trees of jasmin. Sometimes it\r\nwas hard enough to get through the bushes and under the trees, perched up\r\naloft on our camels. We were down in the river-bed part of the time, and\r\nthen climbing through the forest to get to the top of the falls. Above\r\nthe forest rise tiers of cliffs, and there were trees at the top on a\r\ntableland, as well as large isolated trees on most of the mountain tops,\r\nsheltering many birds.\r\n\r\nWe had to wait fully an hour for our tent, as the servants' camels were\r\nsomehow belated, and it was considered to be all owing to the jinni,\r\nwhose abode we passed. Large white bustards assembled round our camp.\r\n\r\nOnce we were settled, there was the usual run on the medicine chest. A\r\nvery nice Bedou soldier, Aman, the head one, was given five pills into\r\none hand by my husband, and as he insisted on grasping his weapons with\r\nhis other, he had such difficulty in consuming them that I had to hold\r\nthe cup of water for him to sip from.\r\n\r\nMadder trees grow about, and the Bedouin make clothes from the silky\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\nWe ascended a good deal the following day, to a point whence our view\r\nextended over the great central desert. It looked like a blue sea with a\r\nyellow shore. We then turned a little to the south, then north again, and\r\nfound ourselves among a quantity of wooded spurs, and on the edge of a\r\ndeep wooded wadi.\r\n\r\nRight up to the tops of the mountains, which reach an elevation of about\r\n3,000 feet, the ground is fertile and covered with grass, on which large\r\nherds of cattle feed; clusters of sycamores and limes growing here and\r\nthere give to the undulating hills quite a park-like appearance. As we\r\nhappened to be there in the dry season, the grass was all brown and\r\nslippery, and there stood around us acres upon acres of hay with no one\r\nto harvest it; but after the rains the aspect of the Gara hills must be\r\nas green and pleasant as those of Derbyshire. The dry grass often catches\r\nfire, and from the mountains in various directions we saw columns of\r\nsmoke arising as if from the chimneys of a manufacturing district. The\r\ncountry through which we travelled for the next two days is covered with\r\nthorny bushes and anthills, and is more like Africa than Arabia. The\r\nanthills, though very extensive, were not so fantastic as those we saw in\r\nAfrica. We were going eastward over high ground; we decided to halt for\r\ntwo nights near a pretty little hole full of maidenhair fern, where there\r\nwas water. It was nice and clean at first, but even at the end of the\r\nfirst day it was much diminished and very muddy. Travellers like\r\nourselves must be a great nuisance drinking up the scanty supply of water\r\nwhich might last the inhabitants for a long while.\r\n\r\nWe had hoped to get a good rest after our many days of marching, but\r\nwhile we were here there came on the most frightful hurricane from the\r\nnorth; it blew steadily for two days and nights and put all rest out of\r\nthe question. With difficulty could we keep our tents erect; when we were\r\nin ours we had to be tightly tied in and sit next to the sunniest wall;\r\nin the evening when the wind abated a little we used to sit by a large\r\nfire, dressed in blankets.\r\n\r\nThe piercing blasts quite shrivelled up our poor unclad conductors, who\r\ncrouched in an inert mass round log fires which they made. We were\r\nobliged to remain inactive, for they said the camels would not move\r\nduring this wind, though I believe the cause of inaction rose more from\r\ntheir own dislike to travel in the cold; and so inert were they that we\r\ncould hardly get them to fetch us water from the neighbouring spring,\r\ntheir whole energy being expended in fetching huge logs of wood to keep\r\nthe fires burning, and I think they were all pleased when the time came\r\nto descend to the lower regions again and a warmer atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWe were afraid to start before the sun was up for fear the camels would\r\nbe too cold to move, and he did not visit us very early.\r\n\r\nSheikh Sehel promised to take us across the Gara border into Nejd if we\r\nwished; but as it would have entailed a considerable delay and parley\r\nwith the sheikhs of the Nejd Bedouin, and as we could see from our\r\npresent vantage ground that the country would afford us absolutely no\r\nobjects of interest, we decided not to attempt this expedition.\r\n\r\nOn leaving our very exposed and nameless camping-ground, we pursued our\r\ncourse in a north-east direction, still passing through the same\r\npark-like scenery, through acres and acres of lovely hay, to be had for\r\nnothing a ton. It is exceedingly slippery, and dangerous foothold for the\r\ncamels; consequently numerous falls were the result, and much of our\r\njourney had to be done on foot.\r\n\r\nWe and they used involuntarily to sit down and slide and be brought up\r\nsuddenly by a concealed rock.\r\n\r\nTo the south the descent is abrupt and rocky to the plain of Dhofar and\r\nthe Indian Ocean, and the horizon line on either side is remarkably\r\nsimilar, for in the far, far distance the sandy desert becomes a straight\r\nblue line like a horizon of water. To the east and west the arid\r\nbarrenness of Arabia soon asserts itself, whereas the undulating Gara\r\nrange, like the Cotswold, is fertile, and rounded with deep valleys and\r\nravines running into it full of rich tropical vegetation.\r\n\r\nOn the second day we began again to descend a hideously steep path, and a\r\ndrop of about 1,500 feet brought us to a remarkable cave just above the\r\nplain, and only about ten or twelve miles from Al Hafa. This cave burrows\r\nfar into the mountain side, and is curiously hung with stalactites, and\r\ncontains the deserted huts of a Bedou village, only inhabited during the\r\nrains. Immediately below this cave in the Wadi Nahast are the ruins of an\r\nextensive Sabæan town, in the centre of which is a natural hole 150 feet\r\ndeep and about 50 feet in diameter; around this hole are the remains of\r\nwalls, and the columns of a large entrance gate. We asked for information\r\nabout this place, but all we could get in reply was that it was the well\r\nof the Addites, the name always associated with the ruins of the bygone\r\nrace. They also said the Minqui had lived in the town. In my opinion this\r\nspot is the site of the oracle mentioned by Ptolemy and others, from\r\nwhich the capital of Dhofar took its name. It much resembles the deep\r\nnatural holes, which we found in Cilicia in Asia Minor, where the oracles\r\nof the Corycian and Olbian Zeus were situated. It is just below the great\r\ncave I have mentioned, and, as a remarkable natural phenomenon, it must\r\nhave been looked upon with awe in ancient days, and it was a seat of\r\nworship, as the ruined walls and gateway prove; furthermore, it is just\r\nhalf a day's journey east of the city of Mansura or Zufar, where, Ibn\r\nBatuta somewhat contemptuously says, 'is Al Akhaf, the abode of the\r\nAddites,' and there is no other point on the plain of Dhofar where the\r\noracle could satisfactorily be located from existing evidence. Some time,\r\nperhaps, an enterprising archæologist may be able to open the ruins about\r\nhere, and verify the identification from epigraphical evidence.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached the valley Imam Sharif said: 'We do not know how we got\r\ndown that place, for all of our feet was each 36 inches from the other\r\nfoot.' We had such trouble squeezing through the trees, too.\r\n\r\nWe encamped not at all far from the deep hole, and at first were too hot\r\nand tired after our tremendous clamber to look round, but my husband\r\nfound it in his sunset stroll, and came and called to me to hurry out\r\nwhile light yet lingered in such joyful tones that I asked, 'Is it Dianæ\r\nOraculum?'\r\n\r\nBefore starting in the morning we went to visit some troglodytes, dirty,\r\nbut pleasant, and willing for us to see all there was to be seen, and as\r\nanxious to see us; indeed, they wished to see more of me than I thought\r\nconvenient, but fortunately my husband's collar-stud came undone and they\r\nall crowded to see his white chest amid shouts of 'Shouf Theodore!' (Look\r\nat Theodore).\r\n\r\nOne of these people had fever and another neuralgia. We found neuralgia\r\npretty common in Arabia. Quassia-chips were given to each to steep in\r\nwater, but carefully tied up in different coloured cotton bags. Our way\r\nwas very uninteresting, due south to the sea at Rizat.\r\n\r\nMy husband's camel required repacking, and he and Hassan managed to lose\r\nsight of the rest of the _kafila_. Imam Sharif and I went on without\r\nperceiving that the rest had stopped. We had to wait an hour to be found.\r\nI dismounted, and sat in a circle of thirteen men. When one of them\r\nwished to attract my attention he tapped me on the knee with sword or\r\nstick, saying, 'Ya (oh), Mabel!'\r\n\r\nOne of the first days I heard them consulting what my name might be;\r\nseveral were suggested, but at last they thought it must be 'Fàtema' and\r\nto try called 'Ya Fàtema!' I said 'My name is not \"Fàtema\";' then they\r\nasked, and thus they learnt our names.\r\n\r\nThey said they did not wish us to give them orders of any kind as they\r\nwere sheikhs; certainly not through the soldiers. 'We are gentlemen, and\r\nthey are slaves, and if we choose we can kill them. What is it to us? We\r\nshall have to pay 400 reals, but we can give a camel each and can well\r\nafford it. We are rich.'\r\n\r\nI must say these men were often very kind to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE IDENTIFICATION OF ABYSSAPOLIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now pursued our way along the coast-line of Dhofar in an easterly\r\ndirection. Wali Suleiman entertained us for a night at a farm he had\r\nbuilt at a place called Rizat, the land around which is watered by an\r\nabundant stream. His garden was rich in many kinds of fruits, and on our\r\narrival, hot and weary from the road, he spread a carpet for us under the\r\nshade of a mulberry tree while our camp was pitched, and ordered a slave\r\nto pick us a dishful of the fruit, which was exceedingly refreshing.\r\nBesides these he provided us with papayas, gourds, vegetables, and all\r\nsorts of delicacies to which we had been strangers during our wanderings\r\nin the Gara mountains. In this genial retreat Wali Suleiman passed much\r\nof his time, leaving behind him at Al Hafa the cares of state and the\r\neverlasting bickerings in his harem.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, refreshed and supplied with the requisites for another\r\njourney, we started off again in our easterly course towards Takha, the\r\nmost important village at the east end of the plain of Dhofar. As we rode\r\nacross the plain we were perpetually harassed by the thought as to where\r\nthe excellent harbour could be, which is mentioned by all ancient writers\r\nas frequented by the frankincense merchants, and which modern writers,\r\nsuch as Dr. Glaser and Sir E. H. Bunbury, agree in considering to be some\r\nlittle way west of Merbat. Yakut tells us how the ancient ships on their\r\nway to and from India tarried there during the monsoons, and he further\r\ntells us that it was twenty parasangs east of the capital. The 'Periplus'\r\nspeaks of it as Moscha, Ptolemy as Abyssapolis, and the Arabs as Merbat;\r\nbut as there is no harbourage actually at Merbat, it clearly could not be\r\nthere. So as we went along we pondered on this question, and wondered if\r\nthis celebrated harbour was, after all, a myth.\r\n\r\nIt was a most uninteresting ride along this coast: flat, and for the most\r\npart barren, broken here and there by lagoons of brackish and\r\nevil-smelling water and mangrove swamps. On the way we saw antelopes and\r\nfoxes with white bushy tails. One night we encamped by one of these river\r\nbeds on slightly rising ground, and were devoured by mosquitoes, and so\r\npestilent are these insects here that they not only attacked us, but\r\ntormented our camels to such a degree that they were constantly jumping\r\nup in the night and making such hideous demonstrations of their\r\ndiscomfort that our rest was considerably interfered with.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Takha, after a ride of fifteen miles, we found ourselves\r\nonce more amongst a heap, or rather two heaps, of Sabæan ruins, which had\r\nnot been so much disturbed by subsequent occupants as those at the\r\ncapital, but at the same time they were not nearly so fine, and the\r\ncolumns were mostly undecorated. There were also some very rough\r\nsarcophagi.\r\n\r\nThe wali of Takha received us well, and placed his house at our disposal,\r\nbut it was so dirty we elected to pitch our tents, and encamped some\r\nlittle distance from the village. On the following morning the wali sent\r\nus with a guide to inspect some ruins round the neighbouring headland\r\nwhich forms one end of the bay, of which Ras Risout is the other. The\r\nrock of which it is composed is white in all the sheltered parts and\r\nwhere the path is polished, and nearly black in the exposed parts. When\r\nwe reached the other side of this promontory, to our amazement we saw\r\nbefore us a long sheet of water, stretching nearly two miles inland,\r\nbroken by many little creeks, and in some parts fully half a mile wide.\r\nThis sheet of water, which is called Kho Rouri, had been silted up at its\r\nmouth by a sandbank, over which the sea could only make its way at high\r\ntide, and the same belt of sand separated from it a fortified rock,\r\nKhatiya by name, which must formerly have been an island protecting the\r\ndouble entrance to what once must have been an excellent harbour, and\r\nwhich could be again restored to its former condition by an outlay of\r\nvery little capital and labour. We were the more amazed at coming across\r\nthis sheet of water, as it is not marked in the Admiralty chart.\r\n\r\nSurely there can be no doubt that this is the harbour which was anciently\r\nused by the merchants who came to this coast for frankincense. It would\r\nbe absolutely secure at all seasons of the year, and it is just twenty\r\nparasangs from the ruins of the ancient capital--exactly where it ought\r\nto be, in fact--and probably the Arabs called it Merbat, a name which has\r\nbeen retained in the modern village on the sheltering headland, where we\r\nlanded when we first reached Dhofar. As for the name Moscha--given in the\r\n'Periplus'--it is like Mocha, a name given to several bays on the Arabian\r\ncoast, and I think we discovered why Ptolemy called it Abyssapolis, as I\r\nwill presently explain. We ascended the rock at the entrance, took a\r\nphotograph of the sheet of water, and felt that we had at last succeeded\r\nin reconstructing the geography of this interesting bit of country.\r\n\r\nI hear that the Egyptologists are in search of a harbour to which the\r\nexpedition to the land of Punt was made under the enterprising Queen\r\nHatasou. Some imagine that this coast of Arabia was the destination of\r\nthis expedition, and I herewith call their attention to this spot, for I\r\nknow of none other more likely on the barren, harbourless coast\r\nbetween Aden and Maskat. If we take the illustration of this expedition\r\ngiven in the temple of Deir al Bahari, we have, to begin with, the\r\nfrankincense trees, the long straight line of water running inland, the\r\ncattle and the birds; then the huts which the Bedouin build on tall\r\npoles, approached by ladders, from which they can inspect the produce of\r\ntheir land and drive off marauders, look exactly like those thereon\r\ndepicted. All that we want are the apes, which certainly do not now exist\r\nin the Gara mountains, but it is just the spot where one would expect to\r\nfind them; and in a district where the human race has been reduced to the\r\nsmallest point, there is no reason why the kindred race of apes should\r\nnot have disappeared altogether. Apes still exist near Aden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ABYSS OF ABYSSAPOLIS, DHOFAR]\r\n\r\nWe had great difficulty in getting the camels to face the water and carry\r\nus to the peninsula, the water being half-way up their sides. On climbing\r\nup we saw columns lying about, and there had been a wall all round the\r\nsummit. It had originally been built in courses with roughly squared\r\nstones, as we could see near the doorway, but the present wall is of\r\nordinary broken stones.\r\n\r\nLeaving the harbour behind us we again approached the mountains, and,\r\nafter journeying inland for about eight miles, we found the valley\r\nleading up to the mountains choked up by a most remarkable formation\r\ncaused by the calcareous deposit of ages from a series of streams which\r\nprecipitate themselves over a stupendous wall in feathery waterfalls.\r\nThis abyss is perfectly sheer, and hung in fantastic confusion with\r\nstalactites. At its middle it is 550 feet in depth, and its greatest\r\nlength is about a mile. It is quite one of the most magnificent natural\r\nphenomena I have ever seen, and suggestive of comparison with the\r\ncalcareous deposits in New Zealand and Yellowstone Park; and to those who\r\nvisited this harbour in ancient days it must have been a familiar\r\nobject, so no wonder that when they went home and talked about it, the\r\ntown near it was called the City of the Abyss, and Ptolemy, as was his\r\nwont, gave the spot a fresh appellative, just as he called the capital\r\nthe Oracle of Artemis.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile from the western side of the whole abyss is a\r\nsmall conical mountain, about 1,000 feet high, which looks as if it had\r\nonce stood free but were now nearly smothered by the petrifaction of the\r\noverflowing water. It rises above the level top of the cliffs, and has\r\nabout a quarter of a mile of abyss on one side, which is only 300 feet in\r\ndepth, and half a mile on the other. It is all wooded. The larger side\r\nand the upper plain is called Derbat, and the smaller Merbat or Mergà.\r\n\r\nThe three days we spent in exploring the neighbourhood of this abyss were\r\nthe brightest and pleasantest of all during this expedition. Our camp was\r\npitched under shady trees about half a mile from the foot of the abyss,\r\nwhither we could wander and repose under the shade of enormous plantains\r\nwhich grew around the watercourse, and listen to the splashing of the\r\nstream as it was precipitated over the rock to irrigate the ground below,\r\nwhere the Bedouin had nice little gardens in which the vegetation was\r\nprofuse. One day we spent in photography and sketching, wandering about\r\nthe foot of the rocky wall; and another day, starting early in the\r\nmorning, with one camel to carry our things, we set off to climb the hill\r\nby a tortuous path under shady trees which conducted us along the side of\r\nthe hill, and got lovely glimpses of the abyss on both sides through the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the summit we found ourselves on an extensive and\r\nwell-timbered flat meadow, along which we walked for a mile or so. It was\r\ncovered with cattle belonging to the Bedouin grazing on its rich\r\npasturage. It seemed like the place Jack reached when he had climbed up\r\nthe beanstalk. At length we came to two lovely narrow lakes, joined\r\ntogether by a rapid meandering stream, delicious spots to look upon, with\r\nwell-wooded hills on either side, and a wealth of timber in every\r\ndirection. We lunched and took our midday siesta under a wide-spreading\r\nsycamore by the stream, after walking up alongside the lakes for nearly\r\ntwo miles; fat milch cows, not unlike our own, were feeding by the\r\nrushing stream; birds of all descriptions filled the branches of the\r\ntrees, water-hens and herons and ducks were in abundance on one of the\r\nlakes, bulrushes and water-weeds grew in them; it would be an ideal\r\nlittle spot in any country, but in Arabia it was a marvel. The trees were\r\nloaded with climbing cactus and a large purple convolvulus with great\r\nround leaves.\r\n\r\nWe wanted to get some water-plants, easily to be obtained if anyone would\r\nhave entered the lake in which they grew, but the jinni or ghinni who\r\nlives there (our old friend the Genius of the 'Arabian Nights') was so\r\ndangerous that the plants had to be hooked out with sticks and branches\r\ntied to strings. Sheikh Sehel maintains that he has seen ghinni in that\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThis wide-spreading meadow can be watered at will by damming up the\r\nstreams which lead the water from the lakes to the abyss, and in a large\r\ncave near the edge of the precipice dwells a family of pastoral Bedouin\r\nwho own this happy valley; before leaving the higher level we went to the\r\nedge and peered over into the hollow below, where, far beneath us, was\r\nour camping ground among the trees, and in the sun's rays the waterfall\r\nover the white cliff gave out beautiful rainbows. We had to cross much\r\nswampy ground, and got our feet wet, without catching the inevitable\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nImam Sharif camped away from us one night and found that the streams\r\nwhich feed them have their source up in the limestone, about two days'\r\njourney from them. The Bedouin are exceedingly proud of them, and in the\r\nabsence of much water in their country they naturally look upon them with\r\nalmost superstitious awe and veneration. Perhaps in Scotland one might be\r\nmore inclined to call them mountain tarns, for neither of them is more\r\nthan a mile in length, and in parts they are very narrow; yet they are\r\ndeep, and, as the people at Al Hafa proudly told us, you could float\r\nthereon any steamer you liked, which may or may not be true, but their\r\nexistence in a country like Arabia is, after all, their chief cause for\r\nrenown. This really is Arabia Felix.\r\n\r\nIf ever this tract of country comes into the hands of a civilised nation,\r\nit will be capable of great and useful development. Supposing the harbour\r\nrestored to receive ships of moderate size, the Gara hills, rich in grass\r\nand vegetation, with an ample supply of water and regular rains, and,\r\nfurthermore, with a most delicious and health-giving air, might be of\r\ninestimable value as a granary and a health resort for the inhabitants of\r\nthe burnt-up centres of Arabian commerce, Aden and Maskat. It is, as I\r\nhave said, about half way between them, and it is the only fertile\r\nstretch of coast-line along that arid frontage of the Arabian Peninsula\r\non to the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nEvery November a fair or gala is held up here by the side of the lakes,\r\nto which all the Bedouin of the Gara tribe come and make merry, and the\r\nfair of Derbat is considered by them the great festival of the year. A\r\nround rock was shown us on which the chief magician sits to exorcise the\r\njinni of the lakes, and around him the people dance. There is doubtless\r\nsome religious purport connected with all this, but, as I have said\r\nbefore, it is extremely difficult to get anything out of the Bedouin\r\nabout their religious opinions; like the Bedouin of the Hadhramout, they\r\ndo not observe the prayers and ablutions inculcated by the Mohammedan\r\ncreed, and the Arabs speak of them as heathen, but beyond this we could\r\nnot find out much. Their language, too, is different from anything we had\r\nheard before. They can understand and converse in Arabic after a fashion,\r\nbut when speaking amongst themselves none of our party, Arab or European,\r\ncould make out anything they said, and from such simple words as we were\r\nable to learn--such, for example, as _ouft_ for _wadi_, a valley, _shur_\r\ninstead of _yom_ for day, and _kho_ instead of _nahr_ for a river--we\r\nwere led to believe that they speak an entirely different language, and\r\nnot a dialect as in the Hadhramout.\r\n\r\nAs we passed through the hay, the Gara had gathered up a lot of it in\r\nsacks, which they put under the camels' loads by day and used as beds by\r\nnight, and between times applied to quite a different purpose. One of\r\nthese sacks was used as a combined dish and strainer when they boiled\r\ntheir rice. The rice was turned out of the pot, and as soon as the cook\r\nhad scraped it all out with his hands they sat round, and fed themselves\r\nwith handfuls of it.\r\n\r\nAfter another day, spent over sketching, photography, and measurements,\r\nwe felt we had thoroughly explored the neighbourhood of the abyss, so we\r\nstarted back to Al Hafa to prepare for our departure from Dhofar.\r\n\r\nIt took us three days to get there. We stayed a night on the way on some\r\nhigh ground above one of the swamps, and on the second day stopped to\r\nvisit Hamran, or Hameroun, where the wali had built a small fort and a\r\nfarm, which supplied him when at Rizat with butter, vegetables and fruit.\r\nHe also grew tobacco there.\r\n\r\nWe found ourselves once more in our old quarters in the castle, where\r\nmany fleas had been born in our absence, while the flies and mosquitoes\r\nwere not diminished. The wali had more prisoners. We again visited Robat\r\nand the other ruins.\r\n\r\nThe interests which centred in this small district--the ancient sites,\r\nthe abyss, and, above all, the surprising fertility of the valleys and\r\nmountains, the delicious health-giving air, and the immunity from actual\r\ndanger which we had enjoyed--combined in making us feel that our sojourn\r\nin Dhofar had been one of the most enjoyable and productive of any\r\nexpedition we had hitherto undertaken, and that we had discovered a real\r\nParadise in the wilderness, which will be a rich prize for the civilised\r\nnation which is enterprising enough to appropriate it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nSAILING FROM KOSSEIR TO ADEN\r\n\r\n\r\nOur object had been to go across from Dhofar by land to the Hadhramout,\r\nacross the Mahri country. Wali Suleiman had done all in his power to help\r\nus, but without much success, as the Gara were more or less at war with\r\nthe Mahri, who are a dangerous warlike tribe. When we first left Al Hafa,\r\na message had been sent to the Mahri chiefs to come and arrange about our\r\njourney, but on our return we found that only two had come. They said if\r\nwe would give them 200 reals, _i.e._ about 12_l._, they would let us go\r\nthrough their country, but they made no allusion to the request that they\r\nwould arrange with the Minhali, Amri, Kattiri, and Tamimi. As far as we\r\nand the wali could make out, they would only have let us go a certain way\r\nalong their coast, and then we should have been in difficulty about a\r\nship. The reply from the sultan of Jedid was also unfavourable, so we had\r\nnothing left but to hire a _batil_ and set sail along the coast for\r\nKishin, to the sultan of which place my husband had a letter from the\r\nBritish political agent at Maskat.\r\n\r\nWe took leave of Wali Suleiman with much regret, and had we foreseen all\r\nthe disappointments that were in store for us we should, I think, have\r\nstayed far longer under his favourable influence. We were sorry\r\nafterwards to hear of his death. A rebellion broke out, in which his\r\ncastle was knocked into ruins, and in the battle he, his eldest son, and\r\nlittle black Muoffok were all killed.\r\n\r\nA long sea journey in an Arab batil is exceedingly uncomfortable. We had\r\na cabin in the stern, open all round; a sail was stretched in front to\r\nsecure our privacy; it was so low that we could by no means stand or even\r\nsit up except on the deck, as 3 feet 6 inches was the height of this\r\nplace. It was roofed over with palm-stalks supported on posts overlaid\r\nwith matting, so slippery that Imam Sharif and Hassan, the interpreter,\r\nhad to tie themselves with ropes, as there was nothing to prevent their\r\nsliding into the sea. I stayed in my camp bed for six days, as there was\r\nnothing else to do. Our servants crowded every space on the outer part of\r\nthe deck in and on boxes. We had some palm-leaf matting hung on the port\r\nand southern side to shield us from the sun, and much rejoiced that we\r\nwere not deprived by the sun of the glorious views which unrolled\r\nthemselves along our starboard side.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, Lobo used to creep in across my husband's feet and\r\nbring our basins to our bed-sides, and when our toilette was finished he\r\nused to creep in and fetch them, and then creep back, and, spreading the\r\nbreakfast on the floor, squat in the middle and hand us our food. The\r\ngunwale of the batil was only three inches from the level of my bed. Airy\r\nas our 'cabin' was, bilge-water was our torment.\r\n\r\nWe had started on January 23, the weather being cool and overcast, about\r\n11 o'clock, and reached the village of Rakhiout in thirty hours--only\r\nforty miles.\r\n\r\nWe called there to do a civility to the wali, and leave two soldiers\r\nthere. This is the end of Omani influence, and there is a small fort as a\r\nprotection against the Mahri. There was a contrary wind and such a\r\nviolent swell that we rocked and tossed for thirty more hours in front of\r\nthe small village, whence parties of inhabitants came to stare at us. It\r\nis on a small flat space, with high hills and cliffs all round it.\r\n\r\nWe started at last, and got at least two miles, when we were awakened by\r\na great gale. I was nearly blown out of bed. The sail was taken down, and\r\nwe were in some danger, as it was feared the mast would give way. We\r\nanchored, and the wind seemed to blow from all sides at once; the small\r\nboat was nearly smashed against the rudder. The stars were shining\r\nbrightly all the time.\r\n\r\nWe started again at dawn, and did not go more than three-quarters of a\r\nmile in the whole day, the wind being so contrary. One of the\r\npeculiarities of our navigation was that whenever we tacked we went\r\ncompletely round. At sunset we had to cast anchor again, and lie tossing\r\ntill three, and then went on well.\r\n\r\nWhile at anchor we heard shouts and cries to come to land, but our\r\nsailors would do nothing of the sort. They said a single man might often\r\nbe seen calling that he was wrecked, and asking to be fetched away, but a\r\nparty of armed men would be behind a rock, and come out and murder the\r\nbenevolent crew and steal the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was really delightful in the morning to open my still sleepy eyes and,\r\nwithout moving, to see the lovely picture which seemed to be passing\r\nbefore me--not I before it--of beautiful mountains with their foreground\r\nof water, every fold and distance filled up and separated by soft\r\nvapours. Then sunrise began to paint the rocks red, and black shadows\r\ncame and changed their shapes, and presently all became hard and stony\r\nlooking.\r\n\r\nPassing Ras Hamar, which is the next cape to Risout, we had seen easily\r\nhow it had acquired the name, for it looks like a donkey drinking, with\r\nits nose in the water and its ears cocked. This shows particularly from\r\nthe west. In the pilot book of that sea, it is stated that it is called\r\nHamar, or Ahmar, from its red colour; but it is not red. The two peculiar\r\npeaks on its summit are noticed.\r\n\r\nThe wind died away about nine, and we shook about and went round and\r\nround; but in the afternoon we had a good wind, and at noon of the next\r\nday (January 28) we were before Kishin.\r\n\r\nThe sultan was at his village, three miles inland, or, more correctly, in\r\nsand--a hot walk. He is a wizened little old man, who can neither read\r\nnor write, and was poorly dressed, visitors being quite unexpected.\r\n\r\nThe village of Kishin, the Mahri capital, consists of a few scattered\r\nhouses and some Bedou huts of matting and poles placed in a dreary sandy\r\nwaste, very different from the fertile plain of Dhofar, and more like the\r\nsurroundings of Sheher.\r\n\r\nWhen my husband asked for the sultan's assistance to go into the\r\nHadhramout, he said: 'No one ever goes that way, it is full of robbers.'\r\n\r\nOf course he was civil enough, as my husband showed him the letter from\r\nMaskat, but he seemed to have little authority. I think his followers\r\nwere sorry to see such a likely prize depart unmolested. Those on board\r\nwere rather alarmed at the length of time consumed in these negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe old Sultan Salem is father to the sultan of Sokotra, which belongs to\r\nthe Mahri tribe, and brother to the sultan of Saihut, another robber\r\nchief, who is equally averse to admitting Europeans to his dominions. The\r\nfact is that these tribes object to European inquiry, as they know they\r\nwould no longer be able to exist in their present condition.\r\n\r\nMy husband extracted from him a letter to his brother of Saihut.\r\n\r\nAfter our futile attempts to penetrate into the Mahri country, there was\r\nnothing left for us but to start again in our boat for Sheher, and rely\r\non the promises which Sultan Hussein al Kaiti had given us the year\r\nbefore of sending us under safe escort to the eastern portion of the\r\nHadhramout valley, which must contain much of interest, not yet having\r\nbeen explored by Europeans; so we set sail again, and were soon passing\r\ncountry that we had ridden over on camels.\r\n\r\nRas Fartak is the great landmark, but the fine scenery ends at Jedid.\r\nLooking back, the rich colouring of the capes, seeming to overlap one\r\nanother, and the great height, give a most impressive effect. The slopes\r\nare adorned with feathery-looking trees, and there are many little sandy\r\nbeaches, and there were also many deep caverns. For two days we saw\r\nhardly an inhabitant.\r\n\r\nBetween Jedid and Ras Fartak the land is low and recedes, and as we\r\nsailed along we decided that it was the mouth of some big valley from the\r\ninterior, and after careful cross-examination of the sultan of Kishin and\r\nour sailors we gathered that this was actually the mouth of the great\r\nHadhramout valley, which does not take the extraordinary bend that is\r\ngiven in our maps, but runs in almost a straight line from west to east,\r\nand the bend represents an entirely distinct valley, the Wadi Mosila,\r\nwhich comes out at Saihut.\r\n\r\nWe were two days getting to Sheher, anchoring both nights; the first, as\r\n'dirty weather' was causing alarm, was a very noisy one, the servants and\r\nsailors talking and singing all night to be in readiness. The second\r\nnight we were put to bed very quietly among the strange and weird stacks\r\nof rocks at Ras Dis, and had a heavy shower of rain, which, of course,\r\npenetrated our matting roof.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Sheher, a messenger was sent ashore with a letter to\r\nSultan Hussein, and a message was returned inviting us to take up our\r\nquarters in the same unfinished palace where we had lived ten months\r\nbefore. One of the first people to greet us was the _nàkhoda_ of the ship\r\non which we had gone to Aden from Sheher. The word _reis_ for captain is\r\nnever used. Ghaleb Mia was at the house to meet us, and we were much\r\ninterested by finding that the governors of everywhere round about were\r\nin Sheher to give up their accounts. He of Hagarein was scowling, but\r\nthey of Dis, Kosseir, and Haura seemed friendly and pleased to see us. We\r\nheard good accounts of various patients, and were especially pleased to\r\nhear that the daughter of the governor of Dis, who had for some time been\r\nbedridden with a bad leg, had been well ever since our visit--quite cured\r\nby Holloway's ointment. The next day there were great negotiations and\r\nplannings as to our future course.\r\n\r\nOur scheme was that we should go from Sheher to Inat in the Hadhramout\r\nvalley, down to Bir Borhut and Kabr Houd, and thence eastward to Wadi\r\nMosila, back to Sheher by the coast, and then try to go westward--or, as\r\nto us appeared preferable, to go up by the Wadi Mosila to Wadi\r\nHadhramout, and then to try to get to the west without returning to\r\nSheher.\r\n\r\nThere we stuck for some days, listening to any gossip we could hear, and\r\ntaking evening walks by the sea, guarded by soldiers. We were told that\r\nSultan Salàh of Shibahm had lost his head wife, the sister of Manassar of\r\nMakalla, but had consoled himself by marrying four others about two\r\nmonths afterwards, and had divorced two of them already. The family of Al\r\nKaiti are not very good friends among themselves; a soldier discharged by\r\nSalàh of Shibahm is always quickly engaged by Hussein of Sheher, and if\r\nHussein dismisses a servant he is sure of a place with Manassar. They\r\nstop each other's letters and annoy each other in many ways, but are\r\nalways ready to unite if any strange foe assails their family.\r\n\r\nManassar had quarrelled with his wife, the daughter of Salàh, because\r\nSalàh, on the death of his wife, had refused to marry a third daughter of\r\nManassar, as his dying wife requested. Hussein had only one wife and no\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThere had been great trouble with the Hamoumi, and only three months\r\nbefore two soldiers had been killed about half a mile from Sheher. Ghaleb\r\nMia and Hussein Mia dared not go to Inbula or anywhere outside their\r\nwalls without forty or fifty men, and when Salàh's daughter, who is\r\nmarried to the seyyid, came to Sheher, she had to come by a circuitous\r\nroute, with an escort of five hundred men.\r\n\r\nWhen a Bedou has committed a murder, he runs to the houses of the\r\nseyyids, where there is sanctuary, and gets absolution on paying four or\r\nfive hundred dollars, according to the rank of the murdered man. Thus\r\ntravelling is difficult unless you have paid _siyar_, and a relation of\r\nthe _siyara_ is kept in prison at Sheher. All this time the behaviour of\r\nthe sultans and their hospitality to us were very different to what it\r\nhad been the year before; they sent us no presents of food, nor did they\r\never invite Imam Sharif to a meal, which they had constantly done when we\r\nwere last there. Their manner was stiff and constrained, and they said\r\nthey themselves had been badly treated for their kindness to us and that\r\nthey were now considered Kafirs themselves. The fact is that all the\r\nMohammedan world was in a state of restless activity, as the jehad, or\r\nholy war, was being preached. And now I will tell a most remarkable\r\ncircumstance, quite the most extraordinary in this book.\r\n\r\nSultan Hussein told my husband _on February 1_ that a consul had been\r\nmurdered at Jedda.\r\n\r\nWe were most excited about this, and anxiously inquired about it when we\r\nreached Aden, but heard that no murder had taken place, _nor did it till\r\nMay_, when several consuls were murdered.\r\n\r\nThis proves that it must have been a very long-arranged plan, and that\r\nthe sultan knew of it and thought it had had time to be carried out. No\r\ndoubt all this accounted for his bad reception of us.\r\n\r\nAfter a good deal of illusory delay, the sultan declared he could not in\r\nany way be responsible for our safety if we went anywhere from Sheher, so\r\nwe had to bow to the inevitable and put ourselves on board a dhow\r\nbelonging to Kutch, bound for Aden.\r\n\r\nThe captain and sailors were all Hindoos, and to our amusement our\r\nMohammedan party were as unclean as ourselves. The crew would not let us\r\ntouch their fire and water, and filled our vessels themselves without\r\ntouching them, very good-humouredly, and they made up an extra galley for\r\nus by putting some sand in a wooden box, and here Christians and Moslems\r\nhad perforce to cook together. Of course we did not mind, but there was\r\nmuch laughter at the expense of the others, in which indeed they joined,\r\nfor they bore their adversity amiably when it brought strange\r\ncooking-fellows.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Aden we still desired to penetrate into the Jebel Akhdar, so\r\nlooked out for a ship going to Maskat. We could find none, therefore we\r\nembarked for India with all our company. I am not going to describe\r\nIndia, but will only tell of our money difficulties.\r\n\r\nSo ignorant were we and everyone at Maskat as to what money was in use in\r\nDhofar, that we were persuaded that it was necessary to take an immense\r\nquantity of small change in the shape of copper coins about the size of a\r\nfarthing, supposed to be Omani. We had four wooden boxes bound with wire,\r\nabout 1 foot long and 5 or 6 inches high and wide, delivered to us, all\r\nclosed up, and said to have a certain sum in each.\r\n\r\nSoon after we set out we opened one of these boxes to get out some money\r\nand have it ready, but found in it so many and various kinds of coins,\r\nall the same size, that we opened all the boxes, making quite a mound on\r\nthe ground, to sort out the German East Africa, English East Africa,\r\nZanzibar, and other useless coins, and then packed them neatly up, an\r\nawfully troublesome and dirty job. We kept out what we thought would\r\npass, but behold! all were useless; no one would look at anything but\r\nMaria Theresa dollars and Indian coins down to two-anna pieces--nothing\r\nlower.\r\n\r\nAll these boxes, therefore, had to return to Maskat, and when paying off\r\nthe interpreter, Hassan, a most respectable person with large, round,\r\ngold spectacles, my husband asked him to be kind enough to take his money\r\nin these boxes and change at Maskat. No, he would only have good silver\r\ndollars; and sadly he rued his want of good-nature.\r\n\r\nWe two and Lobo, whom we retained, went to a hotel in Bombay, but Imam\r\nSharif, Khan Bahadur, his four men, our Goanese cook, Hassan, and a\r\ncertain young Afghan, Ahmet, who had been a sort of odd man and\r\ntent-pitcher, went to a caravanserai; and after Hassan's steamer had\r\ndeparted to Maskat, Imam Sharif came and told us the doleful tidings that\r\nAhmet had disappeared with the good silver dollars and the gold watch and\r\nchain of Hassan. No doubt he then regretted he had not taken the boxes of\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF\r\n\r\nMOUNT ERBA\r\n\r\nand surrounding country\r\n\r\nto illustrate the explorations of\r\n\r\nMr. J. THEODORE BENT\r\n\r\n_Stanford's Geog.^l Estab.^t, London_\r\n\r\nLondon: Smith, Elder & Co.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN AFRICAN INTERLUDE: THE EASTERN SOUDAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCOASTING ALONG THE RED SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1895, though we still wished to continue our\r\ninvestigations in Arabia, we found it impracticable, owing to the warlike\r\nstate of the tribes there, so we decided to turn our attention to the\r\nother side of the Red Sea, and travel once more in Africa.\r\n\r\nParts of Africa have to be discovered and other parts rediscovered. Each\r\nlittle war and each little journey contributes to the accomplishment of\r\nboth these ends with surprising rapidity, but the geographical millennium\r\nis looming in the distance when the traveller will no longer require his\r\nsextant and theodolite, but will take his spade and pruning-hook to\r\ncultivate the land this generation is so busy in discovering.\r\n\r\nThat winter we added a few square miles to a blank corner of the map\r\nwhere re-discovery was necessary, and where re-discovery will go on apace\r\nand produce most interesting results, when we have finished conquering\r\nthe barbarous followers of the Khalifa, and restore law and order to that\r\nwide portion of Africa known as the Eastern Soudan; for the Soudan,\r\nmeaning in Arabic 'the country of the blacks,' really extends from the\r\nAtlantic to the Red Sea. Little did we think when we started to explore\r\nthe western shores of the Red Sea that the explosion with the Dervishes\r\nwas so near, otherwise I think we should have turned our steps in another\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nWe had with us Mr. Alfred Cholmley, who took numbers of beautiful\r\nphotographs, and Lieutenant, now Captain, N. M. Smyth, D.S.O., Queen's\r\nBays, kindly attached to our expedition by Colonel Sir F. Wingate, and to\r\nhis exertions we owe the map.\r\n\r\nMy husband had always thought it foolish to engage an interpreter unknown\r\nto him, on his own responsibility, and would only have one recommended by\r\nthe official of our Government. The choice made for us on this occasion\r\nwas not at all successful. He tried to make out that he was the principal\r\nleader of the party, and his impedimenta far exceeded ours. He may or may\r\nnot have been sent to keep us from going more than ten miles from the\r\ncoast, but no explorer would wish to remain within the limits set down in\r\nthe Admiralty Chart. My husband found it necessary to dispense with his\r\nservices when we were at Mersa Halaib, and we got on far better without\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nOur first task was to choose a ship; it was exciting work rowing about in\r\nthe harbour of Suez in order to find one that would suit us.\r\n\r\nA letter from our interpreter had told us we could have one at 120_l._ a\r\nmonth, a sum which our great experience of sailing-boats told us was\r\nquite too large. When we started our search, having refused this, we were\r\nonly shown wretched boats in which we could hardly sit and certainly not\r\nstand. We espied one we thought would do, and said nothing at that time,\r\nbut afterwards my husband and Matthaios went off by themselves and\r\nengaged her for 35_l._ a month, and I do not think that a better ship was\r\nto be found in Suez--certainly there was none worth 120_l._\r\n\r\nOur boat was an Arab dhow of 80 tons, named the _Taisir_; we at once put\r\nher in the hands of a carpenter, who boarded off two cabins for us four\r\nwhites, in the big, open stern cabin, leaving a sort of verandah in front\r\nof them, about 8 feet in depth, where we lived by day. Campbell Bey, who\r\nlives at Terre Pleine, pronounced by the English Terry Plain, kindly lent\r\nus two water-tanks containing half a ton each.\r\n\r\nWe embarked late on Christmas night, and by the murky light of lanterns\r\nthe ship looked most dreary and uninviting; but when we had furnished it,\r\nby laying down our tent carpet and beds and hanging sheets of coloured\r\ncalico over the gaping boards of our walls, and had put up the cabin\r\nbags, we were quite snug. We always had to close in our verandah with a\r\nsail at night, for when the ship swung round at anchor we were exposed to\r\nthe north wind.\r\n\r\nOur captain, Reis Hamaya, turned out an excellent fellow, as also did the\r\nseventeen sailors he had under him; and though at times they would\r\nquarrel loudly enough amongst themselves, the only points of discord\r\nwhich arose between them and us always had reference to the length of\r\ntime they wished to stop in harbour and the length of distance they\r\nwished to go in a day. Ill-fed, dirty, unkempt men as our sailors were,\r\nwe got to like them all, from the elderly dignified Mohammed, who thought\r\nhe knew more about navigation than the captain, to Ahmet Faraj, the\r\nbuffoon who played the tom-tom and made everybody laugh; this worthy\r\nindividual was the recognised leader of all the festivities with which\r\nthey regaled us from time to time, consisting of very ugly songs and a\r\nyet uglier dance, the chief art in which consisted in wagging their\r\nelastic tails with an energy which mortals further removed from monkey\r\norigin could never hope to approach.\r\n\r\nWe travelled all the first night, but the second we anchored near Safaia\r\nIsland, and the third at a place called Sheikh Ganem, in front of the\r\nAshrafi Light, and the fourth day found us at Kosseir, which means\r\n'little castle.' The Government steamer _Abbas_, which had started one\r\nday after us and gone straight down 'outside', had only got in two hours\r\nbefore us, and we had been 'inside', through the reefs, and stopped all\r\nnight, so we thought we had not done badly.\r\n\r\nWe stayed two nights in the harbour to make our final victualling\r\narrangements. Kosseir, our last really civilised point, is now a wretched\r\nplace, though twice in its existence it has been of importance, owing to\r\nits road connection with Keneh on the Nile. Five miles to the north of\r\nthe present town are the ruins of the old Ptolemaic one, Myos Hormos\r\n(Kosseir Kadim), where the Red Sea fleets in ancient days assembled to\r\nstart for India; twenty years ago it was a favourite point for the\r\ndeparture of pilgrims for Mecca, and the P. and O. had offices there,\r\nwhich are now turned into camel-stables. Kosseir is waiting for a railway\r\nbefore it can again recoup its fortunes.\r\n\r\nThere are two mosques of pretty architecture, with courses of dark red\r\nstone from Keneh, and white Kosseir limestone; there are also diaper and\r\nfretwork patterns; the pillars are similarly decorated and are quaint and\r\npicturesque. The tombs of the Ababdeh sheikhs have melon-shaped domes,\r\nand there are endless dovecotes, chiefly made of broken old amphoræ built\r\ninto walls.\r\n\r\nAlong the whole coast-line from Kosseir to Sawakin one may say that there\r\nare no permanent places of residence, if we except the tiny Egyptian\r\nmilitary stations, with their fort and huts for the soldiers, at Halaib,\r\nMohammed Gol, and Darour; it is practically desert all the way, and is\r\nonly visited by the nomad Ababdeh and Bisharin tribes, when, after the\r\nrains, they can obtain there a scanty pasturage for their flocks. During\r\nthe Ptolemaic and early Arab periods the condition of affairs was very\r\ndifferent; several considerable towns stood on this coast, now marked\r\nonly by heaps of sand and a few fallen walls. In spite of its aridity,\r\nthis coast has a wonderful charm of its own; its lofty, deeply serrated\r\nmountains are a perpetual joy to look upon, and the sunset effects were\r\nunspeakably glorious, rich in every conceivable colour, and throwing out\r\nthe sharp outline of the pointed peaks against the crimson sky.\r\n\r\nThe nature of this coast-line is singularly uniform, and offers\r\ntremendous obstacles to navigation, owing to the great belt of coral\r\nreefs along it, through which the passage was often barely wide enough\r\nfor our dhow to pass, and against which on more than one occasion we came\r\nin unpleasant contact. The bay of Berenice, for example, was for this\r\nreason known in ancient times as akathartos kolpos, and is still\r\nknown as 'Foul Bay'; it can only be navigated with the greatest care by\r\nnative pilots accustomed to the various aspects of the water, which in\r\nmany places only just covers the treacherous reefs. All boats are obliged\r\nto anchor during the night either just inside the reefs or in the\r\nnumerous coves along the coast, which are caused by the percolations of\r\nfresh water through the sandbeds of rivers into the sea, and these\r\nprevent the coral insect from erecting its continuous wall.\r\n\r\nThe rapidly succeeding little harbours formed in the coral reef are\r\ncalled _mersa_, or anchorage, by the Arabs, from _mersat_, anchor.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the coral reef rises above the surface low islets have\r\nbeen formed, with sandy surface and a scant marine vegetation. By one of\r\nthese, named Siyal, we were anchored for a night, and on landing we found\r\nit about three miles in length, some 50 feet in width, and never more\r\nthan 4 feet above the surface of the sea. On its eastern side the shore\r\nwas strewn with cinders from the numerous steamers which ply the Red Sea,\r\nand quantities of straw cases for bottles, out of which the ospreys,\r\nwhich live here in large numbers, have built their nests. Turtles revel\r\nin the sand, and corals of lovely colours line the beach, and at one\r\nextremity of the islet we found the remains of a holy sheikh's hut, with\r\nhis grave hard by. Many such holy men dwell on promontories and on remote\r\nisland rocks along this coast in sanctified seclusion, and they are\r\nregularly supported by the Bedouin and pearl-fishers, who bring them food\r\nand water, neither of which commodities is to be found in such\r\nlocalities. Our sailors on New Year's Eve took a handsome present of\r\nbread and candles, presented to them by us, to a holy man who dwelt on\r\nthe extreme point of Ras Bernas, and had a long gossip with him\r\nconcerning what boats had passed that way and the prospects of\r\ntrade--_i.e._ the slave trade--in these desert regions. They burnt\r\nincense before his shrine, and the captain devoutly said his evening\r\nprayer, whilst he of the tom-tom, Ahmet Faraj, stood behind and mimicked\r\nhim, to the great amusement of his fellows--a piece of irreverence I have\r\nnever seen before in any Mohammedan country. Still I think our sailors\r\nwere as a whole religious; they observed their fasts and prayers most\r\nregularly during Ramazan, and their only idea of time was regulated by\r\nthe five prayers. 'We shall start to-morrow at \"God is great,\" and anchor\r\nat the evening prayer,' and so forth, they used to say.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate how far these coral reefs have changed since\r\nancient days; there is a lagoon at Berenice which looks as if it had been\r\nthe ancient harbour with a fort at its extremity. Now there are scarcely\r\ntwo feet of water over the bar across its mouth; but all ancient accounts\r\nbear testimony to a similar difficulty of navigation down this coast. At\r\nthe same time, it is manifest that this coast-line is just the one to\r\nhave tempted on the early mariners from point to point, with its rapid\r\nsuccession of tiny harbours and its reefs protecting it from heavy seas.\r\nMore especially must this have been the case when the boats were\r\npropelled by oars, and in one's mind's eye one can picture the fleets of\r\nthe Egyptian Queen Hatasou and of King Solomon from Eziongeber creeping\r\ncautiously along this coast and returning after three years' absence in\r\nfar distant regions laden with precious freights of gold, frankincense,\r\nand spices. In later days Strabo and Pliny tell us how flotillas of 120\r\nships proceeded from Myos Hormos to Okelis in thirty days on their way to\r\nIndia, going together for fear of the pirates who marauded this coast,\r\nand in those days the settlements on the Red Sea must have presented a\r\nfar livelier aspect than they do now.\r\n\r\nOn both shores we find a curious instance of the migration and adaptation\r\nof an entirely foreign kind of boat. Some Arabs who have lived in\r\nSingapore--and Singapore is as favourite a point for Arab emigration as\r\nAmerica is for the Irish--introduced 'dug-outs' in their native harbours,\r\nand these have been found so useful in sailing over the shallow coral\r\nreefs in search of pearls, that they now swarm in every Red Sea port, and\r\nsteamer-loads of 'dug-outs' are brought from the Malay peninsula. The\r\nArabs call them 'houris'--why, I cannot think--for a more uncomfortable\r\nthing to sit in, when half full of water in a rolling surf, I never found\r\nelsewhere, except on a South-East African river.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the coast below Ras Bernas and above Sawakin is the\r\nhot-bed of the slave trade, carried on between the Dervishes of the Nile\r\nValley and Arabia. Regular Egyptian coastguard boats keep matters pretty\r\nclear north of Ras Bernas, and we can testify to their activity, for we\r\nourselves were boarded and searched by one; but south of this, before\r\nthe influence of Sawakin is reached, there is a long stretch of country\r\nwhere the traffic in human flesh can be carried on undisturbed. Troops of\r\nslaves are sent down from the Nile valley to the Dervish country at\r\ncertain seasons of the year, and the petty sheikhs along the coast, owing\r\na doubtful allegiance to the Egyptian Government, connive at this\r\ntransport; and the pearl-fishing craft which ply their trade amongst the\r\ncoral reefs are always ready to carry the slaves across to the opposite\r\ncoast, where the markets of Yembo, Jeddah, and Hodeida are open to them.\r\nThis will, of course, be the case until the Dervish power is crushed, and\r\nthe Soudan opened out for more legitimate trade. As we sailed along we\r\npassed hundreds of these pearl-fishing boats engaged in this dual trade,\r\nand nothing could be more propitious for their pursuits than the\r\nabsolutely lawless condition of the tribes by the coast. At Berenice, for\r\ninstance, there are absolutely no government or inhabitants of any sort.\r\nNominally, one of our Nile frontier subsidised sheikhs, Beshir Bey\r\nGabran, of Assouan, has authority over all the country between the Nile\r\nand the Red Sea, but the coast has been visited more frequently by\r\nDervish emirs than by Beshir Bey. One Nasrai, a Dervish emir, is said to\r\nhave resided in the mountains behind Berenice for some time past, and,\r\nwith a small following, collects tithes of cattle from the nomads and\r\nsees to the safe conduct of slave caravans. The collecting of _yusur_, or\r\nblack coral, as they call it, a fossilised vegetable growth, is a third\r\ntrade in which these boats are employed. From this pipes are made, and\r\nbeads, and the black veneer for inlaying tables.\r\n\r\nThe navigation of an Arab dhow is no easy task, with its clumsy\r\narrangements for sails, when there is a strong north wind behind it and\r\nreefs in every direction. Three men are perpetually in the bows on the\r\nlook out for rocks, and indicate the presence of danger to the steersman\r\nby raising their hands. The gear of these boats is exceedingly\r\nprimitive. They do not understand reefing a sail, hence they are obliged\r\nto have no less than five different sizes, which they are constantly\r\nchanging as occasion requires. They use a clumsy cogwheel for raising and\r\nlowering the sails, and do it all by main force, singing silly little\r\ndistiches and screaming at the top of their voices as they haul the\r\nropes. The arrangement for baling out the bilge water is extremely\r\nlaborious. A large trough, with channels on either side, is erected in\r\nthe centre of the boat, into the middle of which the water is baled by\r\nskins from below, and the stenches during the process are truly awful, as\r\nthe water flows out of either channel, according to the roll of the ship.\r\nThere was always a large surface of wet wood to dry up.\r\n\r\nLeaving Kosseir on the last day of 1895, we reached Ras Bernas on the\r\nsecond day of 1896, stopping, of course, each night, always rolling and\r\ntossing about, and always keeping a sharp look out for coral reefs, the\r\nwatchers shouting advice continually to Reis Hamaya.\r\n\r\nWe were supposed to owe our safety in getting through some dangerous\r\nreefs, with not a yard to spare on either side, and escaping our other\r\ndifficulties, to the lucky fact of Reis Hamaya's having discovered\r\namongst the plants that my husband had collected in our walks ashore one\r\nof the order of _Compositæ_, which he pounced on gladly and hung on the\r\nbow of the _Taisir_, as a protection to us.\r\n\r\nHe pointed out another thing, a shrub called _tuldum_, with tiny yellow\r\nflowers on green stalks, good to tie round the arm to make one see far.\r\n\r\nRas Bernas is a long, wandering cape composed of rocky hills of ironstone\r\nand silicate curiously blended together, with shoals and rocks, and coral\r\nreefs, and sandbanks hanging on to it in very shallow water. It is about\r\ntwenty-five miles long, and ends in a sandy spit.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at the head of the lagoon, and spent several days amongst the\r\nruins of this old Ptolemaic town of Berenice, and made sundry excavations\r\nthere. In its centre is an old temple of the date of Tiberius Cæsar, the\r\nhieroglyphs in which are rapidly becoming obliterated. All around is a\r\nsea of mounds covered with sand, where the houses stood, mostly built of\r\nmadrepore, and laid out in streets. On the surface are to be found\r\nnumerous glass beads, Roman coins, bracelets, &c. and a great number of\r\nfragments of rough emeralds. From the celebrated emerald-mines in the\r\nmountain behind we picked up fully fifty of these, besides a large\r\nquantity of olivines or peridots, cornelians, and crystals, testifying to\r\nthe wealth of these parts in precious stones in ancient days.\r\n\r\nA few startled Ababdeh nomads came to visit us; at first they only\r\ninspected us at a distance, but gradually gained courage and came to our\r\ncamp, and we were able to purchase from them two lambs to replenish our\r\nlarder.\r\n\r\nWith its emerald-mines, its harbour, and its great road terminus Berenice\r\nmust have been one of the most important trade centres of the Red Sea;\r\nthough, judging from the plans of the streets we made out, the town\r\ncannot have been a very large one. In digging we turned up immense\r\nquantities of textiles in scraps, fine and coarse, nets, knitted work, as\r\nwell as weaving, plain and in colours, and bits of papyrus in Greek\r\ncursive hand. The wretched Ababdeh tribes were constantly at war with one\r\nanother, and the Dervish Khalifa could make his authority felt about here\r\nwith a small handful of resolute men judiciously placed. Nasrai had, I\r\nbelieve, done this for some time past with only thirty men.\r\n\r\nThe nights here were very cold, the thermometer going down to 46° F.\r\nThere were a few gazelles about, but we saw no other animals.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin brought us large shell-fish in those great shells we see\r\npolished at home. When boiled the fish comes out. It is in shape like a\r\ncamel's foot, and they call it ghemel. In taste it is like lobster and\r\noyster combined, but as tough as pin-wire.\r\n\r\nWe had a great tossing for three days after leaving Berenice, and\r\nstopping every night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nHALAIB AND SAWAKIN KADIM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is hard to imagine anything more squalid than the Egyptian fortress of\r\nHalaib, as it is spelt on the map, or Halei as it is pronounced, which\r\nwas our next halting-place, and from which we succeeded in getting a\r\nlittle way inland. The governor, Ismael, has been there seven years; he\r\nand his family inhabit some wicker cages near the small white fort, and\r\ngathered round them are the huts of his soldiers and the cabins of a few\r\nBisharin, who live under the immediate protection of the fort. Ismael is\r\npossessed of the only patch of cultivated land that we saw during the\r\nwhole of our expedition, where he grows gourds, peas, and aubergines or\r\nbrinjols. The man of most authority in the place is Mohammed Ali Tiout,\r\nhead of the Bisharin tribe of Achmed Orab. He appointed his son, a fine,\r\nintelligent young fellow of five-and-twenty, called _the batran_ in the\r\nlocal dialect, to act as our guide and protector during our exploration\r\nof the Shellal range, which rises some miles inland at the back of\r\nHalaib.\r\n\r\nThe people of this portion of the Soudan between the coast and the Nile\r\nValley, who do not own allegiance to the Khalifa, belong to the Morghani\r\nconfraternity of Mohammedans; their young religious sheikh, a\r\nself-possessed, clever lad of about twenty, lives at Sawakin, and his\r\ninfluence amongst the tribes not affecting Mahdism is supreme. He is\r\ndevoted to British interests, and no doubt in the present condition of\r\naffairs his co-operation will be of great value. The Egyptian Government\r\ninstructed him to write to the sheikhs around Halaib and Mohammed Gol to\r\ninsure our safety, and to this fact I am convinced we owe the immunity\r\nfrom danger we enjoyed, and the assistance given to us in penetrating\r\ninland from Mohammed Gol. The Morghani have the three cicatrices on\r\neither cheek, and as a confraternity they are not in the least fanatical,\r\nand are well disposed to Christians; very different to the Arabs we met\r\nin the Hadhramout, and very different to the Dervishes with whom they are\r\non such hostile terms.\r\n\r\nWhile at Halaib I paid several visits to the wife and family of the\r\nmamour or governor. They were very civil always, and used to kiss me.\r\nThey looked quite as unsettled in their airy brushwood arbours as if they\r\nhad not resided there steadily for seven years.\r\n\r\nThere were three huts about 12 feet by 8 feet, one being a kitchen. There\r\nis a brushwood fence all round, part having a shed for the stores and\r\nwater jars. The wife is a Turk, and has one plain grown-up daughter.\r\nThere was an old lady who made coffee, and a black maid slightly draped\r\nin a sheet once white, but now of a general deep grey, pure black in some\r\nparts. I liked getting coffee and ginger best. The first day I had to\r\nswallow, smiling, tea boiled and a little burnt.\r\n\r\nAll the furniture I saw was a 3-foot bed, three Austrian chairs, a very\r\ncommon wooden table, and a little iron one with a new and tight pink\r\ncotton cover and petticoat to the ground. All was very clean but the\r\nmaid.\r\n\r\nThe kind lady thought her dwelling so superior to mine that she begged me\r\nto come and sleep in the bed with her in shelter from the wind; tents,\r\nshe said, were only fit for men. I did not envy her her home in the\r\ndrenching rain we had all night and half one day. She wore a string round\r\nunder one arm, with seven or eight charms like good-sized pincushions or\r\nhousewifes of different coloured silks.\r\n\r\nWe made two expeditions from Halaib; the first was to the ruins now known\r\nas Sawakin Kadim, which are on the coast twelve miles north of Halaib. As\r\nonly six camels could be obtained we went by boat ourselves, leaving the\r\ncamels for the baggage. For this purpose we deserted the _Taisir_ and\r\nhired a smaller _kattira_, and having gone as near as we could to land,\r\nand been in considerable danger from coral reefs, on which we ran\r\nsuddenly, nearly capsizing, we took to the houri that we had towed\r\nastern. It was very like sitting in a bath, and, after the houri, we had\r\nto be carried a long way. We encamped not far from the shore, and had to\r\nendure a dreadful _khamsin_ and dust-storm from the south, with such\r\nviolent wind that I was blown down, and Matthaios dug our beds out twice\r\nwith a trowel; and the next day we found the north wind nearly as bad.\r\nWhy it did not raise the sand I do not know.\r\n\r\nSawakin Kadim is like Berenice, nothing but a mass of mounds, but it must\r\nat some time or another have been a much larger place. We excavated one\r\nof these mounds, but found nothing earlier than Kufic remains, unless the\r\ngraves, which were constructed of four large blocks of madrepore sunk\r\ndeep into the ground, may be looked upon as a more ancient form of\r\nsepulture. We opened several, but unfortunately they contained nothing\r\nbut bones. Originally this town must have been built on an island, or an\r\nartificial moat must have been dug round it to protect it on the mainland\r\nside; this is now silted up, but is traceable all along. Three large\r\ncisterns for water are still in a fair state of preservation, and I am\r\ntold that a Kufic inscription was found here some years ago. There seems\r\nno doubt that this town is the one mentioned by the Arab geographers,\r\nAbou'lfida and Edrisi, by the name of Aydab, which was a place of\r\nconsiderable importance between Ras Bernas and Sawakin. There are no\r\ntraces elsewhere along this coast of any other town, consequently we can\r\nfairly place it here. Abou'lfida says: 'Aydab is a town in the land of\r\nBedja; it is politically dependent on Egypt, though some say it is in\r\nAbyssinia. This is the meeting-place for the merchants of Yemen and the\r\npilgrims, who, leaving Egypt, prefer the sea route and embark for Yedda.\r\nIn other respects Aydab has more the aspect of a village than a town, and\r\nit is seven days' march north of Sawakin, where the chief of the Bedjas\r\nlives.' Counting a day's march at twenty-five miles, this would place it\r\nnear Halaib, which is 170 miles north of Sawakin. Hitherto on our maps\r\nAydab has been placed near Mohammed Gol, but, as there are no traces of\r\nruins there except the towers to which we shall presently allude, this\r\nposition for an ancient town is untenable.\r\n\r\nEdrisi tells us: 'At the extremity of the desert and on the borders of\r\nthe salt sea is Aydab, whence one crosses to Yedda in one day and one\r\nnight. Aydab has two governors, one appointed by the chief of the Bedja,\r\nand the other by the princes of Egypt.' From the fact that Aydab is\r\nmentioned by none of the earlier geographers it would appear not to have\r\nbeen one of the Ptolemaic settlements, but a town of purely Arab origin.\r\nThe people of Bedja, so often alluded to by these Arabian geographers,\r\nseem to have had considerable power, and to have occupied all the Soudan\r\nand as far north as Berenice, being probably the precursors of the\r\nBisharin Amara tribes, which wander now over this desert country. They\r\nwere the recognised guardians of the old gold-mines which existed in this\r\ndistrict, and concerning which I have more to say presently; and though\r\nvassals of the Egyptian kaliphs, nevertheless they seem to have had\r\nconsiderable local authority, and to have carried on wars on their own\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that in the Aksumite inscriptions we come across an\r\naccount of wars and victories by the old Ethiopian monarchs over the\r\npeoples of Kasuh and Bega to the north of Abyssinia, which peoples\r\nProfessor D. H. Müller identifies with the people of Kush and the Bedja\r\nalluded to by the Arab geographers.\r\n\r\nIn course of time the Bedjas seem to have disappeared from the face of\r\nthe earth and left nothing but their tombs and a few ruined towns behind\r\nthem; and for some centuries it would appear that the coast of the Red\r\nSea north of Sawakin was uninhabited until in later years came fresh\r\ncolonists from the Nile Valley, whose descendants still occupy it.\r\n\r\nThe tribal traditions of the district are all that we have now to rely\r\nupon regarding the immigration of new inhabitants, and they state that\r\ntwo brothers with their families, one named Amer and the other Amar, came\r\nfrom the Nile Valley near Wadi Halfa, and settled along the coast of the\r\nRed Sea; from them are descended the Beni Amer and Amara tribes of\r\nBedouin. These brothers were followed in due course by four other\r\nbrothers, Ali, Kourb, Nour, and Gueil, from whom the tribes and\r\nsub-tribes of the Aliab, Kourbab, Nourab, and Gueilior are respectively\r\ndescended. These tribes have never been anything but pastoral nomads,\r\nliving in miserable mat huts, and spreading themselves over the district\r\nat wide intervals in search of pasture for their flocks. They entirely\r\ndisown having anything to do with the remains of buildings and tombs\r\nfound in their midst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nINLAND FROM MERSA HALAIB\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to Halaib we encamped preparatory to going inland. Great\r\ndoctoring had to be done over the hand of Ahmet Farraj, our clown. He had\r\nheld a large hook overboard, with a bait, but no line, and a shark 7 feet\r\nlong was caught and hauled on board. The shark bit the man's first finger\r\nbadly. Various remedies were applied by the sailors in turns--tar,\r\ngrease, earth, and other things--and it was in a very bad state when\r\nbrought to us. It was quite cured eventually, but we were afraid of\r\nblood-poisoning. When I began cleaning it most tenderly he scraped it out\r\nwith a stick, and his friends dipped stones in the warm water and soundly\r\nscrubbed the surrounding inflamed parts. My husband prescribed a washing\r\nall over with hot water and stones. He was afterwards quite a different\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nOur second expedition was to Shellal. We took two days on our way\r\nthither, passing through clouds of locusts--that is to say, they were in\r\nclouds on our return, but were young and in heaps when we first saw them.\r\nWe stayed at Shellal several days, for my husband thought as we could get\r\nno further in that direction on account of the danger of the Dervishes,\r\nit was as well that we, and especially Captain Smyth, should make as many\r\nexpeditions thence as possible. We heard so many contradictory reports,\r\nbut little thought how imminent the war was.\r\n\r\nAfter our somewhat long experience of life on a dhow we were delighted to\r\nbecome Bedou once more, and wander amongst the fine rocky range of\r\nmountains, but we were disappointed that our guide would not take us far\r\nbehind this range for fear of the Dervishes; and, as shortly after the\r\noutbreak of the war a party of Dervishes came right down to Halaib, there\r\nis every reason to believe that had we gone far inland at this point we\r\nmight have been compelled to pay the Khalifa a not over-pleasant visit at\r\nOmdurman.\r\n\r\nWadi Shellal and the adjacent mountains of Shendeh, Shindoeh, and Riadh\r\nform a _cul de sac_ as far as camels are concerned, and only difficult\r\nmountain paths lead over into the Soudan from here. As far as we could\r\nsee the country did not look very tempting or promise much compensation\r\nfor the difficulties of transit. We were taken by the Batran to a few\r\nspots where there had been ancient habitations; they probably belonged to\r\nthe Kufic period, and were doubtless military stations to protect the\r\nsmall hamlets scattered at the foot of these mountains, when Aydab was a\r\nplace of some importance, from the incursion of hostile tribes from the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nShellal itself reaches an elevation of 4,100 feet; Shindeh, 4,500 feet;\r\nRiadh, 4,800 feet; and Asortriba or Sorturba to the south seems, though\r\nwe did not get its elevation, to be the highest of the group.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELBA MOUNTAINS FROM SHELLAL]\r\n\r\nOn our return to Halaib we passed a Bisharin encampment, consisting of\r\nhalf a dozen beehive huts made of matting on rounded sticks. The women\r\nwere weaving rough cloths at the door of one of them, and were dressed in\r\nlong sheets which once may have been white, but are now the colour of\r\ndirt. They had glass beads and cowries tied to their matted locks, and\r\nbrass and silver rings of considerable size fastened to their noses; the\r\nsmall children ran about naked, with waistbands of leather straps, on\r\nwhich were strung long agate and carnelian beads, with cowrie danglements\r\nhanging down in front. They seemed very poor, and the old ladies to whom\r\nmy husband gave pinches of tobacco were so effusive in their gratitude\r\nthat for some moments he feared his generosity was to be rewarded by a\r\nkiss.\r\n\r\nOur net results from the excursions from Halaib were more or less of a\r\nnegative character. The mountain scenery was grand, and the climate\r\nexquisite, but, from our observations, we came to the conclusion that at\r\nno time was this country of much use to anybody, and that it never had\r\nbeen thickly inhabited, the existence of Aydab being probably due to its\r\nposition as a convenient port opposite Arabia for the inhabitants of the\r\nNile Valley. Water is, and probably always has been, very scarce here,\r\nand, except after the rains, this country is little better than a desert.\r\n\r\nThe Bishari of the Akhmed Orab tribe, who inhabit the mountains, are\r\nexceedingly few in number, and the Batran told us that all the way from\r\nRas Bernas to Mount Sorturba, just south of Shellal, over which country\r\nhis rule extends, the whole tribe could muster only about three hundred\r\nfighting men. They have the Ababdeh to the north, and the Amara Bisharin\r\nto the south, and apparently their relations with their neighbours are\r\nusually strained. These tribes are purely pastoral, and cultivate no land\r\nwhatsoever. They live in huts in groups of from three to six together,\r\nand are scattered over the country at wide intervals. They wear their\r\nhair fuzzy at the top, with a row of curls hanging down the neck, usually\r\nwhite and stiff with mutton fat. They are medium-sized, dark-skinned, and\r\nsome of them decidedly handsome. They are girt only with a loin-cloth and\r\nsheet, and every shepherd here carries his shield and his sword. Under a\r\ngood and settled government they would undoubtedly be excellent members\r\nof society, but with the Khalifa on one side and the Egyptian Government\r\non the other their position is by no means an enviable one. Their huts\r\nare very small and dingy, being constructed with bent sticks on which\r\npalm-leaf matting is stretched; inside they are decorated with their\r\nparaphernalia for weddings and camel-travelling, all elaborately\r\ndecorated with cowrie and other shells, the most remarkable of these\r\nthings being the tall conical hats with long streamers used for dances at\r\nweddings, entirely covered with cowrie shells in pretty patterns. The\r\nthings they use for hanging up food are also prettily decorated with\r\nshells and strips of red and blue cloth. The family occupying a hut sleep\r\non mats in the inner part, with the usual wooden African pillows, and\r\naround the outer edge of the hut are collected their wooden bowls for\r\nsour milk, their skins for water, their incense-burners, and their\r\nlimited number of household utensils. Often when he goes off to distant\r\npasturages a Bishari will pack up his tent and household gods and leave\r\nthem in a tree, where he will find them quite safe on his return. They\r\nlive principally on milk and the products of their flocks, water being to\r\nthem a far more precious article than milk. They are very knowledgeable\r\nin the mountain shrubs and herbs, and pointed out to us many which they\r\neat for medicinal and other purposes; but the only one of these which we\r\nappreciated was a small red gourd climbing amongst the mimosa branches,\r\nresembling a tomato, _Cephalandra Indica_. This they call _gourod_, their\r\nusual word for gourd. Also they are, like the akridophagoi whom\r\nAgatharchides places on their coast, large consumers of locusts when in\r\nseason; they catch them only when they have reached the flying stage, and\r\nroast them in the ashes. We often saw clouds of locusts in this district,\r\ndevouring all the scanty herbage and literally filling the air.\r\n\r\nFor many years past the Egyptian authority in these parts has been _nil_,\r\nand confined only to a few wretched forts on the coast. Dervish raids\r\nfrom the interior and the stoppage of whatever caravan trade there ever\r\nwas have contributed to the miserable condition of affairs now existing.\r\n\r\nOne can well understand why these miserable hounded tribes are wavering\r\nin their allegiance between the Egyptian Government and the Khalifa, whom\r\nthey dread, and why they countenance the slave-traders, for the reason\r\nthat they have no power to resist them.\r\n\r\nFor all practical purposes it is a wretched country, waterless during a\r\ngreat part of the year, except where some deep ancient wells, scattered\r\nat wide intervals over the country, form centres where camels and flocks\r\ncan be watered; and as we travelled along we were struck by the numbers\r\nof these wells which had been quite recently abandoned. But the mountains\r\nare magnificently grand, sharp in outline like Montserrat in Spain, and\r\nwith deep and lovely gorges. Formerly they abounded in mines, and were\r\ncelebrated for their mineral wealth, and if there is ever to be a revival\r\nin this country it will be from this source that hope will come.\r\n\r\nWe had such strong wind when we went to sea again that we feared we\r\nshould not be able to start, but we got away after all, rising up early\r\nto be dressed before we were shaken about; but we forgot to empty our\r\nbasins, and they emptied themselves into our beds, and all the luggage\r\nbanged about and the kitchen things went all over the place, including\r\nthe 'range,' consisting of two little stoves in paraffin-cans, but we got\r\non splendidly till we began to turn into Mersa or Khor Shinab, as the\r\nBisharin call it; the Arab name is Bishbish.\r\n\r\nKhor Shinab is a typical specimen of a _mersa_; it is cruciform, and is\r\nentered by a narrow passage between the reefs, about 20 feet across, and\r\nruns sinuously inland for about two miles, and is never more than a\r\nquarter of a mile wide.\r\n\r\nWe had the second-sized sail up, but that had to be taken down and a\r\nsmaller tried; the sheet of this soon gave way, and the sail went up in\r\nthe air with the block and tore all across. This was a frightful sight,\r\nas we were among coral reefs. The sailors flew about, casting off\r\ngarments in all directions. A smaller sail tore up in a few moments, and\r\nwe were stuck on a reef. Then the smallest sail of all was taken out of\r\nits bag, and that got us off with some grating, the captain and some\r\nothers standing on the reef on the port side with water half up to their\r\nknees, pushing with all their might. There were fourteen fathoms under us\r\nto starboard. The little sail soon gave way at the top and fell into the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOne anchor was sent out in a boat and then another, and when they tried\r\nto get up the first it was so entangled that they were a long time over\r\nit, and one of the five flukes was broken. We were kept off the reef by\r\npoles all this time. That broken anchor was then taken ashore, and we\r\nwere very thankful to be safe.\r\n\r\nThe flat ground for miles inland is composed of nothing but madrepore,\r\nand is covered with semi-fossilised sea-shells, which have probably not\r\nbeen inhabited for thousands of years. We walked over this for three\r\nmiles before reaching the first spurs of the mountains, and it is\r\nimpossible to conceive a more barren or arid spot. Khor Shinab is a\r\nwell-known resort for slave-trading craft; small boats can easily hide in\r\nits narrow creeks and escape observation.\r\n\r\nWe stayed two days while the sails were mended on the shore, and it was\r\nhours and hours before the anchor that was in the reef could be got up\r\nand fastened to the dry land. We did try to get out to sea again, but the\r\nnorth wind was raging so we could not do it, and, besides, the sailors\r\nwere very unwilling to start, as a raven was sitting on the bow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nMOHAMMED GOL\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Mohammed Gol, to which port our dhow next conducted us, our prospects\r\nof getting well into the interior were much brighter, and our ultimate\r\nresults beyond comparison more satisfactory than they had been at Halaib.\r\nMohammed Gol is distinctly a more lively place than Halaib, possessing\r\nmore huts, more soldiers, and actually a miniature bazaar where, strange\r\nto relate, we were able to buy something we wanted.\r\n\r\nThe houses at Mohammed Gol are larger than those at Halaib, and one can\r\nstand up in some parts of nearly all of them.\r\n\r\nThe fort is surrounded by a very evil-smelling moat, and the village\r\nsituated on a damp plain, white with salt. When we made a camp on shore\r\nlater we went well beyond this plain.\r\n\r\nIn the summer season, when the waters of the Red Sea are low, traders\r\ncome to Mohammed Gol for salt. The salterns are situated on the narrow\r\nspit of land called Ras Rowaya; consequently, the people about here are\r\nmore accustomed to the sight of Europeans, and Mohammed Effendi, the\r\ngovernor, or mamour of the little Egyptian garrison, who is young and\r\nenergetic, seems far more in touch with the world than Ismael of Halaib.\r\nHe complained much of the dulness of his post, and passed his weary hours\r\nin making walking-sticks out of ibex horns, a craft he had learnt from\r\nthe Bedouin of Mount Erba, who soften the horns in hot water, grease\r\nthem, pull them out and flatten them with weights and polish them, using\r\nthem as camel sticks. The governor gave us several of these sticks, and\r\nalso presented an ibex-horn head-scratcher to me, remarking as he did so,\r\nwith a polite gesture, that it was a nice thing to have by me when my\r\nhead itched. He was a little and very dark man, with a pleasant, honest\r\nface, and three transverse scars across his cheeks, each about two inches\r\nlong. His secretary was yet smaller, and decorated in the same way. The\r\nchief of the police was a very fat, good-humoured man, with two little\r\nperpendicular cuts beside each eye. These are tribal marks.\r\n\r\nThere was great palavering about our journey into the interior. Though\r\nseveral travellers had visited the Red Sea side of the massive group of\r\nMount Erba on holidays from Sawakin in search of sport, no one had as yet\r\nbeen behind it, and thither we intended to go. The governor had summoned\r\nthree sheikhs from the mountains, into whose hands he confided us. The\r\nday we first landed I thought I never had beheld such scowling,\r\ndisagreeable faces, but afterwards we became good friends. My husband and\r\nI went ashore the second day, and sat in a sort of audience-arbour near\r\nthe madrepore pier, and many maps were drawn on the ground with\r\ncamel-sticks, and we were quite proud that my husband was able to settle\r\nit all with no interpreter.\r\n\r\nSheikh Ali Debalohp, the chief of the Kilab tribe, was to take us to his\r\ndistrict, Wadi Hadai and Wadi Gabeit, some way inland at the back of the\r\nErba mountains, which group we insisted on going entirely round. He was a\r\ntall, fine specimen of a Bishari sheikh, with his neck terribly scarred\r\nby a burn, to heal which he had been treated in hospital at Sawakin. He\r\nis, as we learnt later, a man of questionable loyalty to the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, and supposed to be more than half a Dervish; this may be\r\nowing to the exigencies of his position, for more than half his tribe\r\nliving in the Wadi Hayet are of avowed allegiance to the Khalifa, and\r\nDebalohp's authority now only extends over the portion near the coast. As\r\nfar as we could see his intentions towards us were strictly honourable,\r\nand he treated us throughout our expedition in a much more\r\nstraightforward manner than either of the other two.\r\n\r\nSheikh number two was Mohammed, the son of Ali Hamed, head sheikh of a\r\nbranch of the great Kurbab tribe. As his father was too old and infirm to\r\naccompany us, he took his place. He was an exceedingly dirty and\r\nwild-looking fellow, with a harsh, raucous voice, and his statements were\r\nnot always reliable. We have reason to believe that his father is much\r\ninterested in the slave-trade, and therefore not too fond of Europeans;\r\nbut these sheikhs by the coast are generally obliged to be somewhat\r\ndouble in their dealings, and, when anything can be gained by it, affect\r\nsincere friendship for the English.\r\n\r\nSheikh number three bore the name of Hassan Bafori, and is _wagdab_ or\r\nchief of another branch of the Kurbabs, and his authority extends over\r\nthe massive group of Mount Erba and Kokout. He is a man who seems to\r\nrevel in telling lies, and we never could believe a word he said. Besides\r\nthese head-men we had several minor sheikhs with us, and two soldiers\r\nsent by the mamour from his garrison at Mohammed Gol to see that we were\r\nwell treated. Hence our caravan was of considerable dimensions when we\r\ntook our departure from Mohammed Gol on February 6.\r\n\r\nHe of the Kilab tribe, Ali Debalohp, was the most important of them, and\r\nhe took one of his wives with him; all had their servants and\r\nshield-bearers, and most of them were wild, unprepossessing looking men,\r\nwith shaggy locks and lard-daubed curls, and all of them were, I\r\nbelieve, thorough ruffians, who, as we were told afterwards, would\r\nwillingly have sold us to the Dervishes had they thought they would have\r\ngained by the transaction. These things officials told us when we reached\r\nSawakin; but, to do our guides justice, I must say they treated us very\r\nwell, and inasmuch as we never believed a word they said, the fact that\r\nthey were liars made but little difference to us.\r\n\r\nSome of the men had very fine profiles, and one was very handsome. Their\r\nhair is done something like the Bisharin's--that is, with a fuz standing\r\nup on the top, but the hanging part is not curled; the white tallow with\r\nwhich they were caked, made them look as if their heads were surrounded\r\nwith dips.\r\n\r\nI asked why the tallow was put on. One said to make one strong, another\r\nto make one see far, and a third reason was that the hair might not\r\nappear black.\r\n\r\nWe had fourteen camels for ourselves and two for the police who came with\r\nus. The mamour was in European uniform, with a red shawl wound round his\r\nhead, and sat on a very smart inlaid saddle which came up to his waist in\r\nfront and reached to his shoulder-blades. The chief of the police did not\r\ncome, he being, as he told us, far too fat.\r\n\r\nWe were to fill all our waterskins from a remarkably fine well of\r\nparticularly sweet water at Hadi, so we took only a couple of skinfuls\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n'DANCING ON TOM TIDDLER'S GROUND, PICKING UP GOLD'\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle did we dream when we left Mohammed Gol with our rather extensive\r\ncaravan that behind that gigantic mountain, which though it only reaches\r\nan elevation of 7,500 feet, looks considerably higher from the sea as it\r\nrises almost directly out of the level plain, we were to find an ancient\r\nEgyptian gold-mine, the ruins in connection with which would offer us the\r\nfirst tangible comparison to the ruins which had exercised our minds so\r\nmuch in the gold-fields of South Africa.\r\n\r\nSome miles inland on the plain behind Mohammed Gol are certain mysterious\r\ntowers, some 20 feet high, of unknown origin. They have every appearance\r\nof belonging to the Kufic period, being domed and covered with a strong\r\nwhite cement. They have no doors, but have windows high up: some are\r\nhexagonal, some square, and they are apparently dotted all along the\r\ncoast. Whether they were tombs, or whether they were landmarks to guide\r\nmariners to certain valleys leading into the mountains, will probably not\r\nbe definitely proved until someone is energetic enough to excavate in\r\none. They are found as far south as Massawa, but as far as we could\r\nascertain those we saw were the most northern ones. In one we found two\r\nskeletons of modern date, with the scanty clothing still clinging to the\r\nbones, as they had lain in the agonies of death, poor sick creatures, who\r\nhad climbed in to die.\r\n\r\nThe tower of Asafra, which marks the entrance to the Hadi Valley, is\r\nabout 20 feet high, and is octagonal. It struck us, from its position at\r\nthe entrance of the valley system to the north of Mount Erba, that its\r\noriginal object had been a landmark which would be seen from the sea; had\r\nit been a tomb it would not have had the windows, and had it been either\r\na tomb or a fort it would have had a door. There we halted, and bade\r\nadieu to the governors and officials of Mohammed Gol, who had accompanied\r\nus thus far. Our parting was almost dramatic, and the injunctions to the\r\nsheikh to see to our safety were reiterated with ever additional\r\nvehemence, the mamour holding my husband's hand all the time.\r\n\r\nNear the well of Hadi are numerous ancient structures of a different\r\nnature and more puzzling to account for. Circular walls, from 10 to 14\r\nfeet in diameter and 3 feet high, have been built, some in the valleys\r\nand some high up on the hills. The interiors of these have been filled\r\nwith stones, the largest of which are in the centre, and in the middle of\r\nthese large stones is a depression a foot or so deep. They certainly\r\nlooked like tombs of some departed race, especially as they were\r\ngenerally placed in groups of two or three, and they resembled the tombs\r\nin the north of Abyssinia, except that those are filled with mounds of\r\nsmall stones, whereas these have larger stones and a depression in the\r\ncentre. The water turned out to be rather like port wine to look at, full\r\nof little fish, tadpoles, and leeches. We put alum in a bucket to\r\nprecipitate the worst mud, then filtered it without making it clear, but\r\nit was a tremendous improvement. I think there really was a better\r\nwater-place near, but we did not find it. Bad as it was, water was taken\r\nfor three days, as they said we should see none for that time. As a\r\nmatter of fact, I think the people did not want us to know the\r\nwater-places.\r\n\r\nWe had a very warm night at Hadi, our tent, beds, and even clothes\r\nswarmed with beetles.\r\n\r\nOn February 7 we started for Gumatyewa. All day we went among little\r\npointed hills, some, indeed many, marked with most curious veins of\r\nironstone, sometimes in cross-bars. We soon reached a place in the Wadi\r\nGumatyewa, whence a camel to our surprise was sent for water, and was not\r\nvery long away, so water cannot have been far off. The rest of the camels\r\nwere unloaded, and we sat and waited under some trees. In fact, we could\r\nhave camped near water each of the days which we took getting to Hadai.\r\n\r\nThe sheikhs generally encamped at a little distance from us, and as they\r\nwere given to nocturnal conversations and monotonous noises which they\r\ncalled singing, we were glad they were not too near.\r\n\r\nWe gradually ascended as we followed the valleys inland, after the Wadi\r\nIroquis, until on the fourth day we came to a curious narrow winding\r\npass, about six miles long, which just left room between the rocks for\r\nour camels to walk in single file. This pass, which is called Todin,\r\nlanded us on a small plateau about 2,000 feet above the sea-level, where\r\nwe found a large number of the circular remains. Todin is one of the most\r\nimportant approaches into the Soudan on the north side of the Erba group,\r\nand is practicable the whole way for camels, from which we never once had\r\noccasion to dismount, though going down might not be so pleasant. Before\r\nreaching the pass of Todin we passed a most curious mountain, seeming to\r\nblock up the valley. It looked rather like a rhinoceros feeding among the\r\nacacia-trees.\r\n\r\nTaking this country generally, I can safely say it is as uninteresting\r\nand arid a country as any we have ever visited. Our way perpetually led\r\nthrough valleys winding between low brown mountains, the dry river beds\r\nof which were studded here and there with acacia-trees. Occasionally one\r\ngot a glimpse of the majestic spurs of Erba, and occasionally a fantastic\r\nrock or a hill-slope a trifle greener than the rest would temporarily\r\nraise our spirits.\r\n\r\nAs for water, we had the greatest difficulty about it, and our guides\r\nalways enveloped its existence with a shroud of mystery. Men would be\r\nsent off to the hills with a camel, and return to the camp with skins of\r\nwater from somewhere, probably from gulleys where rain-water still lay;\r\nbut until we reached Wadi Hadai, after a ride of six days, we never saw\r\nwater with our own eyes after leaving Hadi. More water can be obtained by\r\ndigging. There is a great deal of _Mesembryanthemum_ about, which\r\nprobably supplies the place of water to most of the animals living in\r\nthese regions. A good many doves came to drink at the water in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nTwo days more brought us to Wadi Hadai, where we were to halt awhile to\r\nrest the camels. On the hill immediately above us was the circular fort,\r\nwith its door to the east, to which I shall later allude, and on the\r\nplain below was another and smaller Kufic tower, several round buildings,\r\nand large stones erected on several of the adjacent hills evidently to\r\nact as landmarks. Also here we saw many graves of the Debalohp\r\nfamily--neat heaps of white stones, with a double row of white stones\r\nforming a pattern around them, and a headstone towards Mecca, on one of\r\nwhich was a rude Arabic inscription. These tombs reminded us very\r\nforcibly of the Bogos tombs in Northern Abyssinia, and evidently point to\r\na kinship of custom.\r\n\r\nThe place where we stayed in a wood of thorny trees was at the branching\r\nof two valleys. We always had cold nights, but our widely spread camp\r\nlooked cheery enough with eight fires; there were so many different\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nOnce we got into Wadi Hadai we were in Debalohp's country. He was chief\r\nof the large and powerful Kilab tribe, half of which owns avowed\r\nallegiance to the Khalifa, and the other half, with their chief, is put\r\ndown as wavering by the Government at Sawakin. Luckily we did not know\r\nthis at the time, or otherwise I question if we should have ventured to\r\nput ourselves so entirely in his hands, with the horrors of a visit to\r\nKhartoum, as experienced by Slatin Pasha, so fresh in our memories.\r\n\r\nAt Hadai for the first time during the whole of our journey our interests\r\nwere keenly aroused in certain antiquities we found--antiquities about\r\nwhich Debalohp had said a good deal, but about which we had never\r\nventured to indulge any hopes.\r\n\r\nHard by the Debalohp mausoleum was another Kufic tower, though much\r\nsmaller than those we had seen on the coast, and not covered with white\r\ncement, and in the same locality were several foundations of circular\r\nbuildings very neatly executed in dry masonry, which appeared to have at\r\neither end the bases of two circular towers and curious bulges, which at\r\nonce reminded us of our South African ruins. On climbing an adjacent hill\r\nwe found a circular fort, evidently constructed for strategical purposes,\r\nwith a doorway, the ends of the wall being rounded, quite a counterpart\r\nof the smaller ruin on the Lundi river in Mashonaland. The analogy was\r\nindeed curious, and we talked about it hesitatingly to ourselves, as yet\r\nunable to give any satisfactory reason for its existence. On various\r\nheights around were cairns erected as if for landmarks, and we felt that\r\nhere at last we were in the presence of one of those ancient mysteries\r\nwhich it is so delightful to solve.\r\n\r\nWe had as interpreter from Arabic to Hadendowa, as none of our party\r\nunderstood that language, the sheikh whose name was Hassan Bafori. He\r\nbrought three coursing dogs with him. We had also with us a certain\r\nAnnibàle Piacentini as general odd man. He was really Italian, but had\r\nlived so long among Greeks in Suez that he was always called Annibale. He\r\ntalked Greek with my husband, Mattaios, and me, and English with the\r\nothers, besides Arabic.\r\n\r\nWe rested our camels and our men at Hadai, and drank of some fresh water\r\nfrom a little pool, the first we had seen in this barren country, which\r\nwas supplied by a tiny stream that made its appearance for a few yards in\r\na sheltered corner of the valley, a stream of priceless value in this\r\nthirsty land. Debalohp suggested to my husband that he knew of some ruins\r\nin a neighbouring valley to which he could take him, but it was not\r\nwithout considerable hesitation that he decided to go. A long day's ride\r\nin this hot country, supposed to be almost, if not quite, within the\r\nDervish sphere of influence, was not lightly to be undertaken, more\r\nespecially as he had been on so many fruitless errands in search of ruins\r\nat suggestions of the Bedouin, and returned disgusted, and when he\r\nmounted his camel next morning, without any hope of finding anything, and\r\nsure of a fatiguing day, had a reasonable excuse offered itself, he would\r\nprobably not have gone. But the unexpected in these cases is always\r\nhappening. The long ride turned out only to be one of three hours. Wadi\r\nGabeit was somewhat more fertile and picturesque than any we had as yet\r\nseen, and as a climax to it all came the discovery of an ancient\r\ngold-mine, worked in ages long gone by doubtless by that mysterious race\r\nwhose tombs and buildings we had been speculating upon.\r\n\r\nDiodorus, in his account of an old Egyptian gold-mine, describes most\r\naccurately what my husband found in the Wadi Gabeit. For miles along it\r\nat the narrower end were the ruins of miners' huts; both up the main\r\nvalley and up all the collateral ones there must have been seven or eight\r\nhundred of them at the lowest computation. Then there were hundreds of\r\nmassive crushing-stones, neatly constructed out of blocks of basalt,\r\nwhich had been used for breaking the quartz, lying in wild confusion\r\namongst the ruined huts, and by the side of what once was a stream, but\r\nis now only a sandy, choked-up river-bed. On a high rock in the middle of\r\nthe valley he found a trifle of a Greek inscription scratched by a miner,\r\nwho had evidently been working the rich quartz vein just below it.\r\n\r\nOn an eminence behind the valley was another of the circular forts in\r\nruins, similar to the one on the hill above Wadi Hadai, intended\r\nevidently for a look-out post to protect the miners at work below. Burnt\r\nquartz and refuse of quartz lay around in all directions, and on either\r\nside of the valley, stretched for a mile or more, were seams of the\r\nauriferous quartz just as it had been laid bare by the ancient workers.\r\nThere was no question for a moment that he had come across the centre of\r\na great mining industry, lost in these desert valleys behind the mighty\r\nwall by which Mount Erba and its spurs shuts off this district from the\r\nRed Sea littoral.\r\n\r\nNaturally he felt rather startled at being confronted with this\r\nunexpected discovery, and in the short space of time then available it\r\nwas impossible to grasp it all. So he rode back joyfully to tell the news\r\nto his party at Hadai. He told Debalohp that he had decided that we\r\nshould move our camp thither, and stay as long as it was possible.\r\n\r\nDifficulties again confronted us. Our two Kourbab sheikhs did not want to\r\ngo. Sheikh Mohammed Ali Hamid was anxious to get on to his own country,\r\nand Sheikh Hassan Bafori quite set his face against our going at all, and\r\nDebalohp himself had to be firmly spoken to. An extra present to him was\r\nwhat finally helped us, and at length we all made a start on the\r\nfollowing day to my husband's new El Dorado.\r\n\r\nWe had become rather confused as to dates, and there was a difference of\r\ntwo days that we could not be in unity about. Before setting out for Wadi\r\nGabeit we consumed for breakfast the artificial horizon that Captain\r\nSmyth had used for taking our latitude the night before. It was very\r\ngood; it was golden syrup instead of quicksilver.\r\n\r\nWadi Gabeit was just a trifle better than the country we had passed\r\nthrough, having finer trees in the valley beds; and here we saw the first\r\ncolony of natives since leaving Mohammed Gol, consisting only of three\r\nhuts of pastoral Kilabs, which will give an idea of how sparsely this\r\ncountry is inhabited. Debalohp's huts were certainly somewhere in the\r\nvicinity of Hadai, not more than an hour away, but for some reason known\r\nonly to himself he would not take us there, though he went there himself\r\nevery night, and when he joined us on our way to Wadi Gabeit he brought\r\nwith him another wife, having evidently had enough of the other's company\r\non his journey from Mohammed Gol.\r\n\r\nTheir camping arrangements were never luxurious. The Mrs. Debalohp used\r\nto hoist a mat on a spear, to keep off the wind. Mr. Debalohp used to lie\r\non another mat in the open, surrounded by his weapons.\r\n\r\nThe huts we saw were made of sail-cloth, and were very neat inside. There\r\nis a passage all round where pots and baskets are kept, and within that a\r\nsquare room made of matting with a mat floor. One side of this is the\r\nsleeping apartment, and is entirely hung round with meat-safes, dancing\r\nhats, and camel trappings, all adorned with shells and beads. The huts\r\nare so small that it must be difficult to lie at full length.\r\n\r\nI bought a gazelle-trap from these people. It consisted of a circle of\r\nthin sticks, 6 or 7 inches across, bound round and round with bark.\r\nBetween the bindings are set little thin sticks like a wheel, but\r\ncrossing each other thickly in the middle. This is put under a tree over\r\na hole, the noose of a long rope laid round it and the rope tied to the\r\ntree; the whole is covered with earth. When the gazelle comes to eat he\r\nsteps into the hole. By the time he has disengaged himself from the trap\r\nhe is caught in the noose, and a cross stick, 3 or 4 feet long, tied\r\nabout a foot from the end of the rope, prevents him getting through\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nA short time before reaching our goal we were met by a small band of\r\nnatives, who tried to stop our advance with menaces, which we were\r\ndetermined neither to understand nor recognise. Possibly they were some\r\nof the Kilab tribe, who owned allegiance to the Dervishes; possibly they\r\nwere actuated by the inherent dread the Moslem has of Christian\r\nenterprise reaching their secluded vales. However, our show of firearms\r\nand determination to go on had the effect of intimidating them, and after\r\na somewhat feeble hostile demonstration and many palavers, we found\r\nourselves comfortably established in our tents in the heart of the\r\nancient industry, and peacefully distributing medicines from our chest to\r\nour whilom foes.\r\n\r\nThe encounter was amusing to look back on afterwards, but by no means so\r\nat the time; the yelling and brandishing of spears and shields and the\r\nparleying of Hassan Bafori and Mohammed Ali Hamid, who went forward, and\r\nthe earnest wishes for the presence of Sheikh Ali Debalohp, who had gone\r\nround by his home to join us later. We and our camels were led back, but\r\nwe dismounted and went nearer in a body, and then our firearms were\r\ndistributed, and my husband, saying he would wait no longer, went past\r\nthem, we all following. He fortunately knew the way. After a bit our\r\ncamels came, and we were soon in the Wadi Gabeit. Knowing where the water\r\nwas, in a little rocky pool, my husband went straight over to it, and\r\nordered that the water-skins should be filled at once, in case of any\r\ndifficulties. My husband and I and Mr. Cholmley went for a little walk\r\nround a small hill, and then I said I would go back alone to the small,\r\noval valley. Just round a corner I came face to face with all the enemy,\r\non foot and on camels.\r\n\r\nI walked smiling to the worst old man, grasped his hand, and wished him a\r\nhappy day. He started back, wrenched away his hand, waving me away,\r\nthough Hassan tried to make him shake hands. The soldiers rushed forward,\r\nand I sat on a rock laughing at him, and saying I wanted to look at them.\r\nThey all seated themselves close by. Captain Smyth, who had gone around\r\nmaking a reconnaissance, now arrived, his servant Hamid having galloped\r\nback on a camel to fetch him. He thought I was the only survivor. I told\r\nhim the story before them, and imitated the old gentleman, pointing him\r\nout, and they all laughed when I asked how we could be afraid of them\r\nwhen they were so much afraid of me.\r\n\r\nThey all shouted 'Peace! peace!' (salaam! salaam!) 'aman! aman!'\r\n(mercy!)--and subsequently came in a body to our tent to impress upon me\r\nthat _I_ need fear no longer--we were friends.\r\n\r\nThe real truth was that we were now very near, if not quite in, the\r\nterritory of that branch of the Kilab tribe which owns allegiance to the\r\nDervishes; when Captain Smyth rode ahead next day to take observations\r\nfrom a hill called Darurba, Mohamed Ali Hamed, who accompanied him, made\r\nhim dress up in a sheet and pretend to be an Arab woman when they came in\r\nsight of some people whom he declared to be Dervishes.\r\n\r\nWe were told of a native who had lately found a gold nugget whilst\r\ndigging in the sand. The veins of quartz, particularly on the southern\r\nside of the valley, are very marked, and the chiselling by which the\r\nminers had followed up their veins could easily be seen; it would appear\r\nthat the workings here had been of a very extensive character, and the\r\noutput of gold in some remote period must have been very large.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted to a hill about two miles from our camp, where there\r\nare old cuttings in the quartz, some of them going a considerable depth\r\nunderground, and blocks of quartz were still standing there ready to be\r\nbroken up; also we saw several crushing-stones here, but there were no\r\ntraces of miners' huts, so presumably the quartz was removed to the\r\nvalley below.\r\n\r\nOn the rocks near the cuttings we saw many rude drawings, one of a parrot\r\nand several of gazelles, evidently done by the workmen with their\r\nchisels.\r\n\r\nIn referring to records of the ancient gold-mines of Egypt, we find that\r\na mine existed in the Wadi Allaki, some days south of Komombo, in the\r\nBishari district. This mine was visited and identified by MM. Linant and\r\nBonomi; there they found an excavation 180 feet deep, handmills similar\r\nto ours, and traces of about three hundred miners' huts, also several\r\nKufic inscriptions on a rock. The mines, Edrisi tells us, were twelve\r\ndays inland from Aydab. We must therefore look elsewhere for a notice of\r\nanother mine nearer the Red Sea. Edrisi makes two mentions of these mines\r\nof Allaki, in one of which he says they are in a deep valley at the foot\r\nof a mountain; in another he alludes to them as on an open plain. On\r\nturning to Abu'lfida, we find him relating 'that Allaki is a town of\r\nBedja; the country of Bedja is in the neighbourhood of the Red Sea. One\r\nfinds there pearl-fisheries which do not give much profit, but in the\r\nmountain of Allaki is a mine of gold, which covers the cost of working.\r\nThe mountain of Allaki is very celebrated.' Hence it would seem that two\r\ndifferent spots are alluded to both under the name of Allaki, from both\r\nof which gold was obtained, one inland and one near the Red Sea.\r\nProfessor de Goeje, of Leyden, the greatest authority on early Arabian\r\nliterature, pointed out to my husband further discrepancies in the\r\ndistances from Aydab to the gold-mines of Allaki in early Arab\r\ngeographers, and suggests that the mines found by MM. Bonomi and Linant\r\nand ours, though several hundred miles apart, may have belonged to the\r\nsame reef, and have been known by the same name.\r\n\r\nIn M. Chabas' 'Inscriptions des Mines d'Or' we have a very interesting\r\ndissertation on an ancient Egyptian plan of a gold-mine on a papyrus in\r\nthe museum of Turin, of the time of Seti I., which he thus describes:\r\n'Unfortunately, the name of the locality, which the plan gives us under\r\nthe form _Ti, ou, oi_, the phonetic signs of which form a confused\r\ncombination, does not give us any clue. We must therefore limit ourselves\r\nto the conclusion that this map, the most ancient that exists in the\r\nworld, represents to us an auriferous vein in a desert mountain situated\r\nto the east of Higher Egypt, and very near the Red Sea. The shells spread\r\non the path leading to it are a proof that the sea is very near; we can\r\nonly think of the Red Sea, the shores of which abound in coral, in\r\nsponge, and shells variegated with the most beautiful colours.'\r\n\r\nThere seems every probability that the mine discovered by my husband was\r\nthe one illustrated by the most ancient plan in the world, and, curiously\r\nenough, the Greek inscription we found seems to give a combination of\r\nvowels closely resembling the name given on the plan. On Egyptian\r\ninscriptions we constantly read of the gold of Kush, and that the prince\r\nof Kush was always interfered with in his works by the want of water, and\r\nfrom the Arab geographers we learn that they were finally abandoned by\r\nthe caliphs owing to the want of water for washing purposes, and as far\r\nback as the reign of Usertesen we get illustrations of their washing\r\nprocess. Diodorus gives us a vivid description of the gangs of captives\r\nand convicts employed in these mines, and the miserable cruelty with\r\nwhich they were goaded on to work until they died of fatigue. He also\r\ngives some interesting details as to the processes of abstracting gold,\r\nwhich tally well with what we saw on the spot. 'They burn the quartz and\r\nmake it soft,' which will account for the quantity of burnt quartz which\r\nwe saw; and again, 'they take the quarried stone and pound it in stone\r\nmortars with iron pestles.' Mr. Rudler examined the specimens of quartz\r\nwe brought home, and describes it as 'vein quartz, more or less ochreous\r\nwith oxide of iron suggestive of auriferous quartz,' and told us that,\r\nunless we were going to start a company, there was no necessity to get it\r\nassayed; for archæological purposes the presence of gold was sufficiently\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nWill this mine ever be available again for those in search of the\r\nprecious mineral? is the first question that suggests itself.\r\nUnfortunately being no gold expert, I am absolutely unable to give an\r\nopinion as to the possibilities of the still existing quartz seams being\r\npayable or not, but there is abundance of it both in the Wadi Gabeit and\r\nin the collateral valleys, and it is improbable that the ancients with\r\ntheir limited knowledge of mining could have exhausted the place.\r\nSpecimens of quartz that my husband picked up at haphazard have been\r\nassayed and found to be auriferous, with the gold very finely\r\ndisseminated; an expert would undoubtedly have selected even more\r\nbrilliant specimens than these. Against this the absence of water and\r\nlabour seemed to us at the time to negative any possible favourable\r\nresults; but, on the other hand, the mine is so conveniently near the\r\nsea, with comparatively easy road access, that labour might be imported;\r\nand such wonderful things are done nowadays with artesian wells that, if\r\nthe experts report favourably upon it, there would be every chance of\r\ngood work being done, and these desert mountains of the Soudan might\r\nagain ring with the din of industry.\r\n\r\nThe morning after we reached Wadi Gabeit an express messenger reached us\r\nfrom Sawakin, bidding us return to the coast at once, as we were supposed\r\nto be in considerable danger. Dervish raids were expected in this\r\ndirection, and the authorities were evidently afraid of complications. A\r\nsolemn palaver forthwith took place, at which our three sheikhs showed\r\nthat they thought little of the supposed danger, and said that, though we\r\nwere nominally in Dervish country at the time, there was no armed force\r\nnear of sufficient strength to attack us. So we decided, and backed up\r\nour decision with a promised bribe, to stay another night in Wadi Gabeit,\r\nand to continue our course round Mount Erba, as we had originally\r\nintended, and with us we kept the messenger of woe with his gun and spear\r\nas an additional protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nBEHIND THE JEBEL ERBA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left Wadi Gabeit next morning, and on the following day another\r\nmessenger from Sawakin met us with a similar mandate; but as we were now\r\njourneying in a presumably safe direction we annexed him too, and went on\r\nour way rejoicing. Personally we felt that we knew the condition of the\r\ncountry better than the authorities of Sawakin, who had never been there.\r\nIf our sheikhs had meant treachery they would long ago have put it into\r\npractice; our two Kourbab sheikhs, whose property is in and around\r\nMohammed Gol, were ample guarantee for our safety; and, moreover, the\r\ncountry was so absolutely destitute of everything that we gave the\r\nDervishes credit for better sense than to raid it.\r\n\r\nOur first day's march was dreary in the extreme, over country covered\r\nwith dark shale, just like a colliery district without the smoke, and\r\nwith the faintest possible trace of vegetation here and there.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that we lost our little dog, a pet that had\r\njourneyed everywhere with us; when search failed we gave it up for lost,\r\nand drew mournful pictures of the dear creature dying in agonies in the\r\ndesert, foodless and waterless. The clever animal nevertheless retraced\r\nits steps, how we know not, to Mohammed Gol in five days, without food\r\nand with very little water, over the desert paths we had come--a distance\r\nof about 120 miles--and terrified the governor out of his wits, as he\r\nnaturally thought it was the sole survivor of our expedition. It made\r\nits way straight to the jetty and swam to our dhow, the _Taisir_, and was\r\npicked up by our Arab sailors more dead than alive. After resting and\r\nfeeding on the dhow for two days, the dog jumped overboard once more, and\r\nwent off by itself to the mountains for three days in search of us; when\r\nthis failed it returned again, and reached our dhow the night before we\r\ndid, and was ready to welcome us on our return with a wildly\r\ndemonstrative greeting. We eventually gave it to a sergeant at Sawakin,\r\nand have reason to believe that it is at present taking part with its\r\nregiment in the Soudan campaign.\r\n\r\nThat day, Sheikh Mohamed Ali Hamed, who was riding a loaded camel, came\r\nto me so much disgusted with the smell of a box covered with black\r\nAmerican cloth, that he asked me if it were not made of pig-skin. The\r\npeople are so ignorant of what pig-skin looks like that they often handle\r\nit without knowing, otherwise they would not touch it.\r\n\r\nIt was a distinct disappointment to us only to see the mountains of, and\r\nnot to be able to penetrate into, the Wadi Hayèt, owing to its occupation\r\nby Dervish tribes. On excellent authority we heard that there were\r\nnumerous ruined cities there, especially at a spot called Oso; that it\r\nwas more fertile than the parts through which we had passed; that the\r\nMogarra mountains were higher than Erba; and that it was well watered.\r\nApparently this important Soudanese valley takes its rise in Bawati, to\r\nthe south of Erba, and, after making first a bold sweep right through the\r\nheart of the Soudan, it reaches the sea to the north of Mount Elba, some\r\ntwenty miles north of Halaib. This wadi will form an interesting point\r\nfor exploration when the Soudan is once more settled, and if these\r\nstatements are correct it will be of considerable importance in the\r\nfuture development of the country. As for the valleys near the coast,\r\nunless they prove rich in minerals they can never be of much value to any\r\none. In Wadi Gabeit, the only industry now carried on by the very few\r\ninhabitants, except the rearing of flocks, is the drying of senna, which\r\ngrows wild here in considerable quantities. They cut the branches and lay\r\nthem out to dry on levelled circles; these they take down to the coast\r\nand export to Suez.\r\n\r\nWe were now sixty miles, as the crow flies, from the sea. We were\r\nterribly afraid we should be made to go by a lower way between the\r\nmountains and the sea, in which case our journey would not be of nearly\r\nsuch great value in map-making, but at last my husband persuaded the\r\nsheikhs, saying he would sign, with all the rest of us, a paper to\r\nprotect the heads of Sheikhs Ali Debalohp, Hassan Bafori, and Mohamed Ali\r\nHamed, which we did.\r\n\r\nThey said they did not themselves expect any danger. Had they done so\r\nthey would never have let our camp extend over so much ground, with no\r\nconcealment as regarded fires and shouting, nor would they have let their\r\ncamels wander so far afield.\r\n\r\nThe first place after Wadi Gabeit that we camped at was Hambulli, four\r\nhours distant. The thermometer was down to 50° in the night.\r\n\r\nThere was another letter from the mamour and another from Sawakin and a\r\nmost tremendous lot of consultations, and at last my husband sent a\r\nletter to the mamour: 'Your Excellency,--I have decided to go by Erba and\r\nSellala and hope to reach Mohammed Gol in a shorter time by that route.'\r\n\r\nBy this time we were in the Kourbab country, in that part under Sheikh\r\nHassan Bafori, who governs a branch of the tribe. We liked the mamour's\r\nmessenger, Sheikh Moussa Manahm, who came on with us, very much. Four\r\nhours of very desert journeying was our portion the following day. We\r\nwere a good distance from water, but some was obtained by digging, thick\r\nwith sand and earth. We had thus far carried water from Wadi Gabeit. We\r\ntravelled six hours, wandering through desert valleys, in which\r\neverything was dried up, with clumps of grass in it as black as if they\r\nhad been burnt, and as if they had not seen rain for years. All the\r\nvalleys to the west of Mount Erba seem to be arid except Gumateo or\r\nGumatyewa, a big valley which must have water near the surface, which\r\nruns all along at the back of the range, with arid hills from 500 to\r\n1,000 feet on either side of it. Vegetation is more abundant, and masses\r\nof arack-trees (salvadora), supposed to be the mustard-tree of the Bible,\r\ngrow here, the wood of which is much esteemed for cleaning the teeth.\r\nWadi Gumateo seems to be a favourite nursery for camels. On our way we\r\npassed many camel mothers with their infants, feeding on the arack and\r\nother shrubs. At the upper end of this valley, where we encamped for a\r\nnight, Mount Erba, with its highest peak, Mount Nabidua, stands out in\r\nbold and fantastic outline. It is a remarkable range as seen from this\r\nspot, shutting off like a great wall the Soudan from the Red Sea\r\nlittoral.\r\n\r\nIt was a most beautiful place and there was plenty of wood, so we could\r\nhave fine fires at night and burn some charcoal for future use.\r\n\r\nOn February 18 we had a much more enjoyable day, for we were winding\r\nabout among the mountains. Twice we had to dismount to walk over passes.\r\nOne was exceedingly fine, with bold and stupendous cliffs.\r\n\r\nThere were several groups of huts in the Wadi Khur, which we next\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThere is much more vegetation here, many tamarisks and other shrubs\r\ngiving delightful shade. Wadi Khur is the nursery for young donkeys, many\r\nof which, we were told, from time to time escape to the higher mountain,\r\nand have established the race of wild asses to be found here. The valley\r\nhas a good many pastoral inhabitants, and in the side gorges are deep\r\npools of lovely water in natural reservoirs, in which we revelled after\r\nour somewhat limited supply further inland. Up these gorges we found\r\nbulbs, rushes, and water-plants. At our camp here our men busied\r\nthemselves in decorating their locks prior to reaching Sellala.\r\nMutton-fat is beaten in the hands till it becomes like lard, and this\r\nmaterial the hairdresser dabs at the curly wigs of his patients; those\r\nwhose curls become the whitest and stiffest deem themselves the finest.\r\n\r\nAs we were going through a very narrow gorge, where Wadi Khur has changed\r\ninto Khor (gorge) Khur, some stones were bowled down from above, without\r\nhitting any part of our caravan. There was a great deal of shouting from\r\nthe principal sheikhs to the offenders, and they desired one of the\r\nsoldiers to fire off his gun, which he did. Sheikh Hassan did not half\r\nlike the laugh that rose against him when I said, 'Last time it was\r\nSheikh Ali Debalohp's men, and now it is yours.'\r\n\r\nWe encamped while still in the Khor Khur, but the sheikhs would not allow\r\nthe tents to be put near the rocks, fearing disaster, and in the morning\r\nSheikh Hassan was in a great hurry to be off, coming and shouting 'Al\r\nkhiem! Al khiem!' ('the tents!') to hasten us out of them and let them be\r\npacked. We had had to carry water from the last place. It had been so\r\nclear and clean when we had it in our own buckets. It had taken more than\r\nfour hours to fetch with camels, but what we carried on was put into\r\ndirty skins, full of the mud of the place before, so it was horrible and\r\na great disappointment; we had to wait for more.\r\n\r\nWhen we left this camp we were led to suppose we should reach Sellala,\r\nsaid to be an oasis, in about two hours and a half; but it took us an\r\nhour to get out of the Khor Khur, winding among high rocks with most\r\nbeautiful shapes and shadows, rounding Jebel Gidmahm, which was on our\r\nleft, and then we entered a very hideous wadi called Amadet. The floor of\r\nit was very up and down, and high rocks and little hills stood about,\r\nwhereas the wadis are for the most part flat in the middle. But all round\r\nthis ugly wadi there were high and fantastic mountains, range behind\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was a narrow khor called Rabrabda, and finally a great\r\nsandy desert, where the hills were comparatively low, through which we\r\nmarched for several hours, always looking out for the oasis, where we\r\npromised ourselves great enjoyment, intending to spend a few days in so\r\nnice a place. When at last we reached Sellala, which Ali Hamid's son had\r\nled us to believe was a perfect Paradise, instead we found a wretched\r\narid spot, with one deep and well-constructed well, probably of\r\nconsiderable antiquity, surrounded by many mud drinking-troughs, around\r\nwhich were collected a large number of camels.\r\n\r\nAll our promised verdure resolved itself into a few mimosa-trees and\r\ndesert plants, and we encamped in great discomfort in a raging sandstorm,\r\nquite out of patience with our guide for his deceit. The wind was very\r\nwild and cold. We did not enjoy Sellala at all. Our tent had to be tied\r\nup in a tiny sandy cleft, and a huge boulder was under my bed. We had\r\nonly two winds to trouble us there, though, instead of all four, which\r\nwere raging outside. About 200 yards from the well was Ali Hamid's\r\nvillage, a collection of some six or eight huts, in one of which dwells\r\nold Ali Hamid himself, the aged sheikh of this powerful branch of the\r\nKourbab tribe; and the only evidence that we had of greater prosperity\r\nwas that the women here wear gold nose-rings and have long gold earrings\r\nand more elaborate ornaments hanging from their plaited hair.\r\n\r\nAli Hamid looked very old and decrepit. He had a long hooked nose and\r\nexceedingly unpleasant face, and when we saw him we quite believed him\r\nto be, as they say, a hardened old slave-dealer. Perhaps the most\r\nremarkable fact about him was that he had a mother living, a wizened old\r\ncrone who inhabited a tiny hut at Mohammed Gol, and reputed to be 135\r\nyears old by her friends, though I question if she was much over 90. Old\r\nage is rare among these nomads, and hence they make the most of any\r\nspecimen they can produce.\r\n\r\nWe sat in the village for some time, and purchased various camel\r\nornaments--tassels which they hang from their necks, and curious\r\nadornments decorated with cowries, which they place before the covered\r\nawning beneath which great ladies conceal themselves when on a camel\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAli Hamid's son took us the next day on fast-trotting camels to visit\r\nsome graffiti on basaltic rocks about eight miles distant. Here we found\r\nrepresentations of animals chiselled on the hard rocks, similar to those\r\nwe saw in Wadi Gabeit; we could recognise gazelles, camels, and\r\nelephants, and we thought the artist also had intended to depict\r\ngiraffes, mongooses, and other strange beasts. Scattered amongst these\r\nanimals are several Sabæan letters, the two [Symbol: script] (_ya_) and\r\n[Symbol: script] (_wa_) being very conspicuous. These scribblings were\r\nevidently done by the miners who were on their way from the coast to Wadi\r\nGabeit, having landed at a convenient little harbour close by called\r\nSalaka. There is also one of the ruined towers not far from this spot,\r\nand the letters point to the fact that some of the miners here engaged\r\nmust have been of Sabæan or Southern Arabian origin.\r\n\r\nSheikh Ali Hamid came often to see us, with many other sons, besides\r\nMohamed, who had travelled with us, and a few of the latter's children,\r\nclothed and naked. They used to sit in a semicircle round the door of our\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nOf course an exchange of gifts took place, and we were sent a sheep and a\r\nhuge basketful of milk. The basket was shaped like a vase, a foot in\r\ndiameter. A very nice inhabitant of the forbidden Wadi Hayet came to see\r\nus, Sheikh Seyyid Ta'ah. He gave us useful information as to the\r\ngeography of his neighbourhood and the course of the valley.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smyth went off from Sellala with Sheikh Mohamed to take a peep\r\ninto Wadi Hayèt, and on February 22 we left the place without any regret\r\nand turned northward. There are five Sellalas, and one is really an\r\noasis. The splendid mountains of Erba had been quite obscured by the\r\nsand, though there had been a magnificent view of them when we arrived.\r\n\r\nOn the way we passed three more of the tall towers similar to those we\r\nhad previously seen, and felt still more convinced that they were\r\nconnected with the gold industry in the inland valley, and had been built\r\nto mark the roads conducting in that direction.\r\n\r\nWe tried to find a sheltered nook to encamp in when we reached the\r\nmountains, but in vain. We stayed at Harboub, and were nearly stifled by\r\nthe dirty dust that blew into the tents. The water was very clear and\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\nWe continued northward for two hours and a half, and then turned westward\r\nup the steep Wadi Ambaya.\r\n\r\nWadi Ambaya is the chief valley of Mount Erba, and it runs right into the\r\nheart of the mountain. Up this we were conducted by Sheikh Hassan, in\r\nwhose territory we now found ourselves. This valley is fairly well\r\ninhabited by pastoral people; they live in huts dotted about here and\r\nthere, which are difficult to recognise from their likeness in colour to\r\nthe rocks surrounding them, which they would almost seem to have been\r\nmade to mimic. The slopes of Erba provide pasturage for a large number of\r\nflocks at all seasons of the year. Nabidua, the highest peak of the\r\nrange, reaches an elevation of 7,800 feet; Sherbuk and Emeri are not\r\nmuch lower, and the outline of the rugged peaks is exceedingly fine. Up\r\nin the higher parts of this range there are a great number of ibex,\r\nseveral of which fell to Captain Smyth's rifle, but we did not care much\r\nfor the flesh. The natives hunt them with dogs of a breed said to be\r\npeculiar to these parts.\r\n\r\nOur camp in Wadi Ambaya was a delicious spot, amid fantastic boulders and\r\nrich vegetation. On climbing up the gorge beyond us we came across a\r\nstream with running water, forming deep green pools among the rocks, and\r\nto us, after the arid deserts we had passed through, this spot was\r\nperfectly ideal; and the people, too, who dwell up in the higher ground,\r\nlook infinitely healthier--lithe, active men, who leap like goats from\r\nrock to rock, each with a sword and shield. There are several valleys in\r\nErba penetrating into the heart of the mountains, but Ambaya is the\r\nprincipal one.\r\n\r\nIn the outer part of the valley, which is rather open, is a way into the\r\nWadi Addatterèh, where we had already been. It was a tremendous scramble\r\nto get up the gorge, and our tents were perched on rocks, and Matthaios\r\nwas delighted with his nice clean kitchen in the middle of the gorge. He\r\nrigged up some sticks to hang a cloak up as a shade. The servants had\r\nplenty to do preserving antelopes and ibex heads, and burning charcoal\r\nand washing.\r\n\r\nWe were here made glad by Captain Smyth's safe return, and after staying\r\nthree days we returned to the mouth of our wadi, and then went on toward\r\nthe north, and after five hours camped under some large trees near a well\r\nof very good water, called Tokwar.\r\n\r\nWe finished our journey into the Wadi Koukout at 8 o'clock next morning,\r\nhaving to leave the camels and squeeze on on foot. It is a veritable\r\nfrying-pan. We had hardly room to pitch our tents, or to get into them\r\nwhen pitched, by reason of the big boulders and steep hollows where\r\nwater swirled about. There was good water quite close.\r\n\r\nWe had another messenger from Sawakin, Hassan Gabrin, to guide us by\r\nland, or, if we went by sea, to say we should go quickly.\r\n\r\nThe morning after our arrival we started very early to visit Koukout, a\r\nmountain really separate from Erba, but looking like a spur of it, the\r\nhighest peak of which is only 4,000 feet above the sea. Here again one\r\npenetrates into the mountain by a curious gorge, with deep pools of\r\nwater, the rocks about which are, if possible, more fantastic than those\r\nof Erba. One comes to chasms, over which the water flows, which look like\r\nthe end of all things; but by climbing up the side of these one finds the\r\ngorge continuing until the very heart of the mountain is reached, where\r\nis a little open ground well stocked with water and green. High up here\r\nwe spent a few hours at a pastoral village, where we found the women\r\nbusily engaged in making butter in skins tied to a tree; these they shake\r\nuntil butter is produced. They store it in jars, and take it to Mohammed\r\nGol to exchange for grain, but they eat very little except the products\r\nof their flocks, and, like the Abyssinians, they do not mind eating meat\r\nraw.\r\n\r\nWe saw some interesting domestic features in this mountain village. The\r\nchildren are given toy shields and spears, with which to practise in\r\nearly life; and we found here several long flutes with four notes each,\r\nthe music of which is weird and not unlike that of the bagpipes, and well\r\nsuited to the wild surroundings.\r\n\r\nHere, too, they play the ubiquitous African game, munkala or tarsla. Two\r\nrows of six holes are dug in the ground, and in these they play with\r\ncounters of camel-dung a mysterious game which I never can learn. Here\r\nthey call it _mangola_, and it is played all down the East Coast, from\r\nMashonaland to Egypt, and also, I hear, on the West Coast; it seems a\r\ngeneral form of recreation throughout the Dark Continent, and has been\r\ncarried by Africans to all parts of the world to which they have\r\nwandered. Here they were playing with holes in the sand, but one often\r\nsees them dug in marble blocks, or on rocks, or in pavements.\r\n\r\nThere are two games--the game of the wise and that of the foolish; the\r\nformer, like chess, requires a good deal of thought.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLUTE-PLAYERS IN THE WADI KOUKOUT, SOUDAN]\r\n\r\nSheikh Hassan Bafori's mother resided in this village, so old that she\r\nlooked like the last stage of 'She,' but no one said she was as old as\r\nold Ali Hamid's mother.\r\n\r\nI think the weaving arrangements were quite the most rude I have ever\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe yarn had been wound over two sticks about 20 feet apart, and that\r\nstick near which the weaving was begun was tied by two ropes, each a foot\r\nlong, to pegs in the ground. The other was simply strained against two\r\npegs. At this end a couple of threads had been run to keep the warp in\r\nplace. There was no attempt to separate the alternate threads so as to\r\nraise each in turn. There was a stick raised 4 or 5 inches on two forked\r\nsticks to separate the upper and under parts of this endless web of 40\r\nfeet. The weaver sat on her goat's-hair web, and never could get the\r\nshuttle across all the way. It consisted of a thin uneven stick, over a\r\nfoot long. She had to separate twelve to fifteen threads with her hand,\r\nand stick in a pointed peg about 10 inches long, while she put the\r\nshuttle through that far; then she beat it firm with this instrument and\r\nwent on as before, patiently.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd boys looked very graceful, playing on the long flutes with\r\nfour notes. One of these flutes belongs to each hut. We were interested,\r\ntoo, in seeing men making sticks out of ibex horns. They cover the horn\r\nwith grease, and put it in hot water or over the fire to melt and soften\r\nit, and then scrape and scrape till it is thin enough and able to be\r\nstraightened. The ibex-horn hairpins are made with six or seven bands of\r\nfiligree round them. The women's camel-saddles have great frameworks of\r\nbent sticks, nearly as large as some of the huts, to give shelter, and\r\nare very smart indeed on a journey.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Koukout, Sheikh Hassan took us to his well at Tokwar again, a\r\ndeep and presumably ancient well, near which he has his huts; and from\r\nthere to a spot called Akelabillèh, about four miles from Tokwar, and not\r\nfar from our original starting-point of Hadi. Here we found slight traces\r\nof gold-working. About half a dozen crushing-stones lay around, and a\r\ngood deal of quartz refuse. Probably this was a small offshoot of the\r\nmore extensive mines in the interior which had not repaid continued\r\nworking.\r\n\r\nA rapid ride of three hours from Akelabillèh brought us back again to\r\nMohammed Gol and the close of our expedition, for already the first\r\nmurmurs of disturbances with the Dervishes were in the air, and the\r\nmamour of Mohammed Gol and the officers at Sawakin affected to have been\r\nvery anxious for our safety. We, however, being on the spot, had been in\r\nblissful ignorance of any danger, and further considered that the country\r\nwe had traversed was not the least likely to be raided by any sensible\r\npeople, desert and waterless as it was for the most part, and would offer\r\nno attractions in the shape of booty, except in the fastnesses of Mount\r\nErba itself. Not one inch of the ground was under cultivation, and the\r\nfew inhabitants were the poorest of the poor, and I think this is the\r\nonly expedition we have ever made in which we never once saw such a thing\r\nas a hen or an egg.\r\n\r\nBy the by, at the huts near Tokwar we rejoined Sheikh Ali Debalohp, who\r\nhad been invited by Sheikh Hassan to stay a night, and with due\r\npermission from my husband he was able to do so. We saw the sleeping\r\narrangements. On the ground was a piece of matting large enough for both\r\nto sleep on, and another bit a yard high, supported by sticks, round the\r\nthree windiest sides.\r\n\r\nThey were busy playing with a large lizard, of which they seemed to be\r\nafraid, and which had a forked tongue and very long teeth. It had a\r\nstring round its neck, and was kept at bay with a sword.\r\n\r\nWe reached Mohammed Gol the quicker that we had no foot passengers. All\r\nhad scrambled on to the camels, and so we were by twos and threes on our\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe little mamour Mohammed Effendi was delighted to see us, and we were\r\nsoon drinking tea in his public arbour, surrounded by a crowd of now\r\nsmiling faces--the very same faces which had scowled upon us so\r\ndreadfully when we first landed. We and our little dog Draka were equally\r\ndelighted at once more meeting.\r\n\r\nWe found the south wind blowing, if it can be said to do so in a dead\r\ncalm--prevailing would perhaps be a better word. The madrepore pier had\r\nbeen nearly swept away, and the houses near the water were flooded.\r\n\r\nWe settled into our ship again that evening.\r\n\r\nNext day was pay-day, and my husband and Matthaios went ashore with more\r\nthan 40_l_. to distribute. The three big sheikhs, by the advice of the\r\nmamour, were given 2_l_. apiece; the soldiers got ten shillings each--far\r\ntoo much, he said; Mohammed Ismail, Sheikh Hassan Gabrin, Sheikh Moussa\r\nManahm, Mohammed Erkab, and one Akhmet, a great dandy, had five shillings\r\neach.\r\n\r\nBesides this, other presents were given. Sheikh Ali Debalohp had a\r\nquilted cotton coverlet, and Mohammed Ali Hamid the same and a\r\ncartridge-belt; Sheikh Hassan Bafori a blanket, a smart silk keffieh and\r\na sword-belt; and the mamour an opera-glass and a silk blanket, besides\r\nminor things; all seemed very well satisfied. They certainly were all\r\nvery nice to us.\r\n\r\nThe secretary gave me a tremendously heavy curved camel-stick of ebony,\r\nand the mamour besides a head-scratcher, which he had made me himself\r\nfrom an ibex horn, a stick of ibex horn, and seven and a half pairs of\r\nhorns.\r\n\r\nWe were weatherbound yet another day, everything damp and sticky. The\r\nsouth wind seems to me to have a very mysterious scooping and lifting\r\npower; no other wind lifts sand and water along as this one does. The\r\nwind began to freshen up towards night and got as far as the east, and by\r\nmorning was blowing strong north by east.\r\n\r\nMy husband had, as usual, to go out and stir up Reis Hamaya and tell him\r\nwe must be off. He seemed as much surprised as he always was. We had a\r\nfarewell visit from the little mamour, and off we set for a very rolly\r\nvoyage. The whole day we rolled with the smallest sail, everything\r\nbanging, beds jostling, but we were glad no longer to feel wet and sticky\r\nas regards our clothes, bedding, and the whole ship. Our last night on\r\nboard was not the least exciting.\r\n\r\nWe had stopped near Darour amongst reefs of coral.\r\n\r\nEvery night when we cast anchor the ship used to turn round so that the\r\nnorth wind blew full on us and our cabins, but this night it whizzed\r\nround so violently as to drag the anchors, and we went back on to a\r\nreef--only a little, though, but enough to alarm all on board. The\r\nanchors had to be got up and taken by boat to fix into another reef. It\r\nwas necessary for all the gentlemen and servants to assist the sailors in\r\nhauling us off the reef. It was very hard on the sailors, for their\r\nsupper was smoking hot, ready for them after their day's fast, and the\r\npoor fellows had to work till 9 o'clock, doing the best they could for\r\nthe safety of the ship.\r\n\r\nWe went to bed, however, with the unpleasant knowledge that we were not\r\nvery tightly fastened up, and the uneasy feeling that we might drag in\r\nthe night, and not without making some little preparation in case of a\r\nswim.\r\n\r\nWe were all safe in the morning, but almost the first thing we did, as we\r\nsat at breakfast, was to grind over a reef, more than the length of the\r\nkeel.\r\n\r\nWe duly reached Sawakin in the afternoon of March 4, where Hackett Pain\r\nBey, who was acting-governor, kindly lent us two accommodation in the\r\nGovernment House, and we said farewell to the _Taisir_, its cockroaches,\r\nits mosquitoes, and its mouse; and the ship had immediately to be turned\r\nover on her side for repairs--needed, as the coral reefs had done a good\r\ndeal of damage. Reis Hamaya was enchanted with a gift of the cabins with\r\ntheir padlocks, and I am sure they soon became very dirty holes.\r\n\r\nThough we were scolded for our pains, our approving consciences told us\r\nhow pleasing to the British Government those pains had been, and how glad\r\nit was of some map beyond the Admiralty chart. Eight days after our\r\narrival the news of the declaration of war came to Sawakin.\r\n\r\nWe were offered a passage to Suez in the _Behera_ (which means delta),\r\nbut as an ordinary steamer came in, and we did not know how long the\r\n_Behera_ might be waiting for troops, we thought it better to make our\r\nway northward at once. We reached Cairo just in time for Captain Smyth to\r\nbe rewarded for his hard work, while with our expedition, by being\r\nordered off to the war by Sir F. Wingate, who, with the Sirdar, was\r\nstarting that night; Captain Smyth was to follow in two days.\r\n\r\nWe felt very proud, and now he has the Victoria Cross, because 'At the\r\nbattle of Khartoum Captain Smyth galloped forward and attacked an Arab\r\nwho had run amok among the camp-followers. Captain Smyth received the\r\nArab's charge and killed him, being wounded by a spear in the arm in so\r\ndoing. He thus saved the life of one, at least, of the camp-followers.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF\r\n\r\nSOKOTRA\r\n\r\nto illustrate the travels of\r\n\r\nMR. J.

During recent years two botanical expeditions\r\nhave visited it, one under Professor Balfour, and one under Dr.\r\nSchweinfurth, and the results added marvellously to the knowledge of\r\nquaint and hitherto unknown plants.\r\n\r\nWe passed two months traversing it from end to end, with the object of\r\ntrying to unravel some of its ancient history so shrouded in mystery, and\r\nlearn something about its present inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMariette Bey, the eminent Egyptologist, identifies Sokotra with To Nuter,\r\na place to be bracketed with the land of Punt in the pictorial\r\ndecorations of the temple of Deir el Bahri, as resorted to by the\r\nancients for spices, frankincense, and myrrh; and he is probably correct,\r\nfor it is pretty certain that no one given spot in reach of the ancients\r\ncould produce at one and the same time so many of the coveted products of\r\nthat day--the ruby-coloured dragon's blood (_Draco Kinnabari_ of Pliny),\r\nthree distinct species of frankincense, several kinds of myrrh, besides\r\nmany other valuable gum-producing trees, and aloes of super-excellent\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nIt is referred to by the author of the 'Periplus' as containing a very\r\nmixed and Greek-speaking population drawn together for trading purposes,\r\ntrafficking with Arabia and India. Abu'lfida, Africanus, and other\r\nwriters, Arabic and otherwise, mention Christianity as prevailing here,\r\nand Theodoret, writing in the beginning of the fifth century, speaks of\r\nthe great missionary Theophilus as coming from the island of Diu to teach\r\nChristianity in India.\r\n\r\nCosmas Indicopleustes calls the island Dioscorides. He visited it in the\r\nsixth century, and accounted for the Greek-speaking population he met\r\nwith by saying that they had been placed there by the Ptolemies. El\r\nMasoudi considered the Greek a purer race in Sokotra than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the tenth century Sokotra was a noted haunt of pirates\r\nfrom Katch and Gujerat Bawarij, from a kind of ship called _barja_.[13]\r\n\r\nTraders came from Muza Lemyrica (Canara) and Barggaza (Gujerat).\r\n\r\nIbn Batuta gives an account of a certain Sheikh Said of Maskat being\r\nseized by Sokotran pirates, who sent him off empty-handed to Aden.\r\n\r\nMarco Polo describes the catching of whales for ambergris. El Masoudi[14]\r\nsays the best ambergris comes from the sea of Zinj in East Africa: 'The\r\nmen of Zinj come in canoes and fall upon the creature with harpoons and\r\ncables, and draw it ashore and extract the ambergris.'\r\n\r\nIn the inscription of the Nakhtshe Rustam, near Persepolis, which we saw\r\nwhen in Persia in 1889, thirty countries are named which were conquered\r\nby Darius, the Akhemenid, amongst them Iskuduru, _i.e._ Sokotra.\r\n\r\nThough it is Arabian politically, Sokotra geographically is African. This\r\nis the last and largest of a series of islands and islets stretching out\r\ninto the Indian ocean, including the little group of Abdul Kerim. Some of\r\nthese are white with guano.\r\n\r\nDarzi, Kal Farun, Sambeh, and Samboyia are the names of some of the\r\nsmaller ones. Sokotra itself is situated about 240 miles from Cape\r\nGuardafui, and is about 500 miles from Aden.\r\n\r\nThe latitude of the island is between 12° 19' and 12° 42', and the\r\nlongitude between 53° 20' and 54° 30'. It is 72 miles long from east to\r\nwest, and 22 miles wide from north to south. There is a coral reef nearly\r\nall the way from Africa to beyond Ras Momi.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Admiralty charts the water between the islands and the\r\nmainland is 500 fathoms deep, but among the islands nowhere is it deeper\r\nthan 200 fathoms.\r\n\r\nIt is an island that seems to be very much in the way as far as\r\nnavigation is concerned, and many shipwrecks have been occasioned by its\r\nbeing confused with the mainland, one being taken for the other. The\r\nwreck of the _Aden_, and the great loss of life resulting from it, which\r\ntook place so soon after we were there, is still fresh in our memories.\r\n\r\nOur party consisted of Mr. Bennett, who was new to Eastern life, our old\r\nGreek servant, Matthaios, and two young Somali, Mahmoud and Hashi. They\r\ncould talk a little English, but generally talked Arabic to us and\r\nMatthaios. We were told before starting that Mahri, or Mehri, was the\r\nlanguage most in use, and we nearly committed the serious error of\r\ntaking a Mahri man from Arabia, who could also speak Arabic, as an\r\ninterpreter, but fortunately we did not do so, as he would have been\r\nquite useless, unless he could also have talked Sokoteriote.\r\n\r\nWe found it no easy matter to get there. First we were told we should, if\r\nwe attempted to go by sailing-boat, have to coast to Ras Fartak, on the\r\nArabian coast, and let the monsoon blow us to Sokotra, and this seemed\r\nimpracticable. Finally we arranged with a British India steamer, the\r\n_Canara_, that it should 'deviate' and deposit us there for a\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe ss. _Canara_ promised to await the arrival of the P. and O. steamer\r\nbefore leaving Aden, and would, for one thousand rupees (62_l._), take us\r\nto Sokotra and remain four hours. After that we were to pay thirty rupees\r\nan hour, and in no case would she tarry more than twenty-four hours. If\r\nlanding were impossible, we were to be carried to Bombay.\r\n\r\nWe were landed in a lifeboat, through the surf at the town of Kalenzia,\r\nwhich lies at the western end of the island. It is a wretched spot, a\r\njumble of the scum of the East; Arab traders, a Banyan or two, a\r\nconsiderable Negroid population in the shape of soldiers and slaves, and\r\nBedouin from the mountains, who come down with their skins and jars of\r\nclarified butter, to despatch in dhows to Zanzibar, Maskat, and other\r\nbutterless places.\r\n\r\nButter is now the chief product and almost the sole export of the island,\r\nand Sokotra butter has quite a reputation in the markets along the shores\r\nof Arabia and Africa. The sultan keeps a special dhow for the trade, and\r\nthe Bedouin's life is given up to the production of butter. Nowhere, I\r\nthink, have I seen so many flocks and herds in so limited a space as\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nKalenzia (the place has been spelt in so many ways that we took the\r\nliberty of spelling it phonetically as we heard it pronounced) has an\r\napology for a port, or roadstead, facing the African coast, which is the\r\nmost sheltered during the prevalence of the north-east monsoon. Separated\r\nfrom the shore by a bar of shingle is a lagoon, fed by the waters coming\r\ndown from the encircling mountains, which reach an altitude of 1,500 or\r\n2,000 feet. The lagoon is very prettily embowered with palms and\r\nmangroves, and the waters are covered with wild duck, but it is a wonder\r\nthat all the inhabitants do not die of fever, for the water is very\r\nfetid-looking and they drink from nothing else. I believe this is the\r\nwater which is supplied to ships. The shore is rendered pestiferous by\r\nrotting seaweed, and the bodies of sharks, with back fin cut out and tail\r\ncut off, which are exposed to dry on the beach. We preferred the brackish\r\nwater from a well hard by our camp until we discovered a nice stream\r\nunder the slopes of the mountains, about three miles away, to which we\r\nsent skins to be filled. This stream is under the northern slope of the\r\nKalenzia range, and near it are the ruins of an ancient town, and as the\r\nwater trickles on towards the lagoon it fertilises the country\r\nexceedingly, and its banks are rich in palms and other trees. The\r\nabandoned site of this old town is infinitely preferable to the modern\r\none, and much healthier.\r\n\r\nWe were received in a most friendly way by the inhabitants, and hoped\r\nthat, as we were English and the island was to some extent under British\r\nprotection, we should be able to proceed inland at once. Our nationality,\r\nhowever, made not the slightest difference to them, and we were told we\r\nmust encamp while our letters were taken to the sultan, who lives beyond\r\nTamarida, and await his permission to proceed farther. The eight days we\r\nhad to remain here were the most tedious of those we spent on the island.\r\n\r\nOne of our amusements was to watch boat-building accomplished by tying a\r\nbundle of bamboos together at each end and pushing them out into shape\r\nwith wooden stretchers.\r\n\r\nThey have enormous lobster-pots, 6 feet to 8 feet in diameter, made of\r\nmatting woven with split bamboo, in patterns something like the seats of\r\nour chairs. The men often wear their tooth-brushes tied to their turbans;\r\na sprig of arrack serves the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhilst at Kalenzia we must have had nearly all the inhabitants of the\r\nplace at our tent asking for a remedy for one disease or another; they\r\nseemed to be mostly gastric troubles, which they would describe as pains\r\nrevolving in their insides like a wheel, and wounds. The Sokotra medical\r\nlore is exceedingly crude. One old man we found by the shore having the\r\nbowels of a crab put on a very sore finger by way of ointment. A baby of\r\nvery tender age (eleven months) had had its back so seared by a red-hot\r\niron that it could get no rest, and cried most piteously.\r\n\r\nThe poor little thing was wrapped in a very coarse and prickly goat-hair\r\ncloth, and its mother was patting its back to stop its cries, quite\r\nineffectually, as you may well imagine. I spread some vaseline on a large\r\nsheet of grease-proof paraffin paper and applied it most gently. Its\r\nwhole family then wrapped it up in the goat-hair cloth in such a way as\r\nto crush and put aside the dressing, and the mother laid it on its back,\r\nthough I had warned her not to do it, on her knees, and jumped it up and\r\ndown. The baby was none the better, but all around seemed pleased, and I\r\ncould only sadly think that I had done my best. I find the grease-proof\r\npaper most valuable to spread ointment for man and beast where rags are\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\nOne old lady, with an affection of the skin, would only have the 'bibi'\r\nas her doctor, so she came to me with a good many men to show her off,\r\nbut would have nothing to do with my husband. I said the first treatment\r\nmust consist in a thorough washing all over with warm water and soap:\r\nbut behold! I heard there was no soap in the island, so halves and\r\nquarters of cakes of Pears' soap as well as whole ones, were distributed\r\nas a precious ointment.\r\n\r\nThey have no soap, no oil, no idea of washing or cleansing a wound, and\r\ncauterisation with a hot iron appears to be their panacea for every\r\nailment.\r\n\r\nA favourite remedy with them here, as in Arabia, is to stop up the\r\nnostrils with plugs fastened to a string round the neck to prevent\r\ncertain noxious scents penetrating into it; but, as far as we could see,\r\nthey make no use whatsoever of the many medicinal herbs which grow so\r\nabundantly on the island.\r\n\r\nThe women of Kalenzia use turmeric largely for dyeing their faces and\r\ntheir bodies yellow, a custom very prevalent on the south coast of\r\nArabia; they wear long robes, sometimes dyed with indigo, sometimes of a\r\nbright scarlet hue. The pattern of their dress is the same as that worn\r\nin the Hadhramout, _i.e._ composed of two pieces of cotton cloth wide\r\nenough to reach the finger-tips and with a seam down each side. The front\r\npiece is longer than in the Hadhramout, coming down to within a foot of\r\nthe ground, but the train is also very much longer, and must lie more\r\nthan a yard and a half on the ground. These ladies get good neither from\r\nthe length nor the breadth of their dresses, for as the train evidently\r\nincommodes them, they twist the dress so tightly round their bodies that\r\nthe left side seam comes straight or rather lop-sidedly behind and one\r\ncorner of the train is thrown over the left shoulder all in a wisp. There\r\nis nothing to keep it up, so down it comes continually, and is always\r\nbeing caught up again. I never saw a train down, except once for my\r\nedification.\r\n\r\nTheir hair is cut in a straight fringe across the forehead and is in\r\nlittle plaits hanging behind. They wear a loose veil of a gauzy nature,\r\nwith which they conceal half their faces at times. Silver rings and\r\nbracelets of a very poor character, and glass bangles, complete their\r\ntoilet, and the commoner class and Bedou women weave a strong cloth in\r\nnarrow strips of goat-hair, which they wrap in an inelegant fashion round\r\ntheir hips to keep them warm, sometimes as their only garment. They do\r\nnot cover their faces. From one end of Sokotra to the other we never\r\nfound anything the least characteristic or attractive amongst the\r\npossessions of the islanders, nothing but poor examples of what one finds\r\neverywhere on the south coast of Arabia and east of Africa.\r\n\r\nMany weddings were going on during our residence at Kalenzia, and at them\r\nwe witnessed a ceremony which we had not seen before. On the morning of\r\nthe festive day the Sokotrans, negro slaves being apparently excluded,\r\nassembled in a room and seated themselves round it. Three men played\r\ntambourines or tom-toms of skin called _teheranes_, and to this music\r\nthey chanted passages out of the Koran, led by the 'mollah'; this formed\r\na sort of religious preliminary to a marriage festival; and in the\r\nevening, of course, the dancing and singing took place to the dismal tune\r\nof the same tom-toms, detrimental, very, to our earlier slumbers. The\r\n_teherane_ would seem to be the favourite and only Sokotran instrument of\r\nmusic--if we except flutes made of the leg-bones of birds common on the\r\nopposite coast, and probably introduced thence--and finds favour alike\r\nwith Arab, Bedou, and Negro.\r\n\r\nThe people here did not torment us by staring at and crowding round us.\r\nThey came only on business, to be doctored, to sell something, or to\r\nbring milk wherewith to purchase from us lumps of sugar.\r\n\r\nThe houses are pleasantly shaded amongst the palm groves, and have nice\r\nlittle gardens attached to them in which gourds, melons, and tobacco\r\ngrow; and in the middle of the paths between them one is liable to\r\nstumble over turtlebacks, used as hencoops for some wretched specimens of\r\nthe domestic fowl which exist here, and which lay eggs about the size of\r\na plover's.\r\n\r\nThough a poor-looking place it looks neat with its little sand-strewn\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nIt contains a single wretched little mosque, in character like those\r\nfound in third-rate villages in Arabia; Kadhoup or Kadhohp possesses\r\nanother, and Tamarida no less than two; and these represent the sum total\r\nof the present religious edifices in Sokotra, for the Bedouin in their\r\nmountain villages do not care for religious observances and own no\r\nmosques.\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of water in the south-western corner of the island\r\nwe were advised not to visit it; the wells were represented to us as dry,\r\nand the sheep as dying, though the goats still managed to keep plump and\r\nwell-looking. Perhaps the drought which had lately visited India may have\r\naffected Sokotra too; and we were told before going there that a copious\r\nrainfall might be expected during December and January, for Sokotra gets\r\nrain during both monsoons; but during our stay on the island we had\r\nlittle rain, except when up on the heights of Mount Haghiers.\r\n\r\nOne day we two went some distance in the direction of the mountains, and\r\ncame on a large upright rock with an inscription upon it, evidently late\r\nHimyaritic or Ethiopic, and copied as much of it as was distinguishable.\r\nNot far off was the tidy little hamlet of Haida. The walls of the yards\r\nthere are circular.\r\n\r\nFarther on, behind the village of Kissoh, are the ruins of an ancient\r\nvillage with a long, well-built, oblong structure in the middle, possibly\r\na tomb; and it was behind this again that we found the good water that we\r\ndrank afterwards.\r\n\r\nThere must once have been a large population, to judge by the way the\r\nhills are terraced up by walls, and the many barren, neglected palm-trees\r\nabout among the old fields.\r\n\r\nThe Kalenzia range of mountains is quite distinct from Haghier, and is\r\nabout 1,500 or 2,000 feet high. We could find no special name for it.\r\nThey call it Fedahan, but that is the generic Sokoteriote word for\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nThe highest peak is called Màtala.\r\n\r\nWe were very glad when a venerable old sheikh named Ali arrived bringing\r\nus a civil letter from the sultan and saying he had been sent to escort\r\nus to Tamarida.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Elliot, i. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: i. 136.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nERIOSH AND KADHOUP\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter four days waiting for camels, and the usual wrangling over the\r\nprice and casting lots for us, which here they do with stones instead of\r\nwood as in Arabia, we started late on Christmas Day, going of course only\r\na short way. As all were mounted on the baggage we could trot all the\r\nway; the camels were not tied in strings. The first night we stopped at\r\nIsèleh, an interesting place at the entrance of Wadi Gàhai below Mount\r\nLèhe Diftom, about two hours from Kalenzia, whence at night we could see\r\nthe numerous fires of troglodytes high up on the sides of the mountains;\r\nand were able next day to ride nearly all the way, except over a pass to\r\nLim Ditarr, a depression in the hills sometimes filled with water, though\r\nthere was none for us. A little was fetched, but we had to keep the water\r\nfrom our evening wash to serve next morning. This depression had in\r\nformer times been used as a reservoir, for we could detect the remains of\r\na stone embankment, a good deal despoiled for Moslem tombs.\r\n\r\nOur onward journey took us past a lovely creek, called Khor Haghia,\r\nrunning two miles inland, with silted mouth and overhanging yellow and\r\nwhite rocks. The bright blue water and green mangroves made a brilliant\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter of a mile inland there is a deep pot of salt water,\r\nevidently left behind by the ocean when it receded from the shores of\r\nSokotra; it is about 200 feet across, and has its little beach and\r\nseaweeds all complete, with its trees and bushes in its cliffs.\r\n\r\nWe lunched at the brackish well of Dia, and at sunset reached the hideous\r\nplain of Eriosh, or Eriush, which has a flat surface of rock, about a\r\nquarter of a mile in extent and partly covered with dried mud, and of\r\nsuch soft stone that we could easily cut into it with pebbles. It is\r\ncovered with purely Ethiopic graffiti, almost exactly similar to those we\r\nsaw on the steps of the church and on the hillsides around Aksum in\r\nAbyssinia--long serpent-like trails of Ethiopic words, with rude drawings\r\ninterspersed of camels, snakes, and so forth. Riebeck, who went inland\r\nfrom Itur, says these are Greek. Conspicuous amongst them are the\r\nnumerous representations of two feet side by side, frequently with a\r\ncross inserted in one of them; there are many separate crosses, too, on\r\nthis flat surface--crosses in circles, exactly like what one gets on\r\nEthiopic coins. We met with another inscribed stone to the east of the\r\nisland, bearing similar lettering.\r\n\r\nHard by this flat, inscribed surface are many tombs of an ancient date.\r\nThese tombs, which are found dotted over the island, bear a remarkable\r\nresemblance to the tombs of the Bedja race, once dwelling on the shores\r\nof the Red Sea to the north of Sawakin, and subject to the Ethiopian\r\nemperor; they consist of enormous blocks of unhewn stone, inserted in the\r\nground to encircle and cover the tombs, and this forms another link\r\nconnecting the remains on the island with Abyssinia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLAIN OF ERIOSH, SOKOTRA.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Abyssinian Christian monarchs conquered Arabia in the early\r\ncenturies of our era, and Christianised a large portion of that country,\r\nthey probably did the same by Sokotra, and, inasmuch as this island was\r\nfar removed from any political centre, Christianity probably existed here\r\nto a much later period than it did in Arabia. Marco Polo touched here,\r\nand alludes to the Christians of the island.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of two isles near Greater India, inhabited respectively by\r\nmen and women, he adds: 'They are Christians, and have their bishop,\r\nsubject to the Bishop of Socotora. Socotora hath an archbishop not\r\nsubject to the Pope, but to one Zatuli, who resides at Baldach, who\r\nchooseth him.'\r\n\r\nF. Xavier said among other things 'that each village had a priest called\r\n_kashi_. No man could read. The _kashis_ repeated prayers in a forgotten\r\ntongue, frequently scattering incense. A word like Alleluia often\r\noccurred. For bells they used wooden rattles. They assembled in their\r\nchurches four times a day, and held St. Thomas in great veneration. The\r\n_kashis_ married, but were very abstemious. They had two Lents, and\r\nfasted from meat, milk, and fish.'\r\n\r\nWhen Padre Vincenzo the Carmelite visited the island in the seventeenth\r\ncentury he found the last traces of Christianity. 'The people still\r\nretained a perfect jumble of rites and ceremonies, sacrificing to the\r\nmoon, circumcising, and abominating wine and pork. They had churches\r\ncalled _moquame_, dark and dirty, and they daily anointed with butter an\r\naltar. They had a cross, which they carried in procession, and a candle.\r\nThey assembled three times a day and three times a night; the priests\r\nwere called _odambo_. Each family had a cave where they deposited their\r\ndead. If rain failed they selected a victim by lot and prayed round him\r\nto the moon, and if this failed they cut off his hands. All the women\r\nwere called Maria.' Of this there is now no trace. Both Sacraments had\r\ndied out.\r\n\r\nThis debased form of Christianity existed as late as the seventeenth\r\ncentury. The island was one of the places visited by Sir Thomas Roe in\r\n1615.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that all ostensible traces of our cult have long\r\nago been obliterated, and the only Sokoteri religious term which differs\r\nin any way from the usual Mohammedan nomenclature is the name for the\r\nDevil; but we found, as I have already said, the carved crosses on the\r\nflat surface at Eriosh, and we found a rock at the top of a hill to the\r\neast of the island which had been covered with rude representations of\r\nthe Ethiopic cross. Scattered all over the island are deserted ruined\r\nvillages, differing but little from those of to-day, except that the\r\ninhabitants call them all Frankish work, and admit that once Franks dwelt\r\nin them of the cursed sect of the Nazarenes. We felt little hesitation in\r\nsaying that a branch of the Abyssinian Church once existed in Sokotra,\r\nand that its destruction is of comparatively recent date.\r\n\r\nIf we consider that the ordinary village churches in Abyssinia are of the\r\nflimsiest character--a thatched roof resting on a low round wall--we can\r\neasily understand how the churches of Sokotra have disappeared. In most\r\nof these ruined villages round enclosures are to be found, some with\r\napsidal constructions, which are very probably all that is left of the\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\nNear Ras Momi, to the east of the island, we discovered a curious form of\r\nancient sepulture. Caves in the limestone rocks have been filled with\r\nhuman bones from which the flesh had previously decayed. These caves were\r\nthen walled up and left as charnel-houses, after the fashion still\r\nobserved in the Eastern Christian Church. Amongst the bones we found\r\ncarved wooden objects which looked as if they had originally served as\r\ncrosses to mark the tombs, in which the corpses had been permitted to\r\ndecay prior to their removal to the charnel-house, or koimêthêria, as the\r\nmodern Greeks call them.\r\n\r\nWe stayed two days at Eriosh to study the _graffiti_ and tombs.\r\n\r\nWater had to be fetched from Diahàmm, which we afterwards passed. It was\r\nbrackish. I have heard _riho_ said for water, but _diho_ was mostly used,\r\nand certainly the names of many water-places began with Di. I remember my\r\nhusband answering the question where we should camp by calling out in\r\nArabic 'Near the water.' This was echoed in Sokoteri, '_Lal diho_.'\r\n\r\nWe took five days in getting from Kalenzia to Tamarida, and found the\r\nwater question on this route rather a serious one until we reached Mori\r\nand Kadhoup, where the streams from the high mountains began. Mori is a\r\ncharming little spot by the sea, with a fine stream and a lagoon, and\r\npalms and bright yellow houses as a foreground to the dark-blue\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nKadhoup is another fishing village built by the edge of the sea, with a\r\nmarshy waste of sand separating it from the hills; it possesses a\r\nconsiderable number of surf-boats and canoes, and catamarans, on which\r\nthe fishermen ply their trade. Just outside the town women were busy\r\nbaking large pots for the export of butter, placing large fires around\r\nthem for this purpose. The Sokotrans are very crude in their ceramic\r\nproductions, and seem to have not the faintest inclination to decorate\r\ntheir jars in any way. There were quantities of flamingoes on the beach.\r\n\r\nWe encamped at the foot of the hills, with a watery and sandy waste\r\nbetween us and the village.\r\n\r\nThere are the foundations of some curious unfinished houses near Kadhoup,\r\nalso assigned to the Portuguese; but there appears to me to be no reason\r\nwhatsoever for ascribing these miserable remains to the builders of the\r\nfine forts at Maskat, the founders of Ormuz and Goa, and the lords of the\r\nEast up to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThe mountains here jut right out into the sea, forming a bold and rugged\r\ncoast line, and the path which connects the two places is as fine a one\r\nto look upon as I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nWe had read a very awe-inspiring account of this path by Lieutenant\r\nWellsted, and so were quite disposed to believe all our camel-drivers\r\ntold us of the awful dangers to be encountered. They had formed a plan\r\nwhereby their Kadhoup friends might come in for some of our rupees. We\r\nwere not only to pay for camels, but also for a boat. Some, at least, of\r\nthe camels were sure, they said, to fall into the sea from the cliffs,\r\nand our possessions, if not our lives themselves, might be lost. They\r\nsaid that we ought to send our baggage by boat, even if we risked the\r\nmountain path ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe assured them that we had landed in Sokotra (which they pronounce\r\nSakoutra) to see the island, and not to circumnavigate it. Others could\r\npass, so we could.\r\n\r\nTheir last hope was in my hoped-for faintheartedness. They watched till I\r\nwas alone in the tent, and, having recounted all the perils over again,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n'Let the men go over the mountain, but you, O Bibi! will go in a boat,\r\nsafely. You cannot climb, you cannot ride the camel, no one can hold you;\r\nthe path is too narrow, and you will be afraid.'\r\n\r\nThat being no good, old Sheikh Ali came. He was anxious, poor old man, to\r\nbe spared the exertion, and eventually rode all the way, except when\r\nthere was no room. He said I should go in a boat with him; he would take\r\ncare of me and give me musk (which he called misk) when we reached\r\nHadibo. He often promised misk, but I never got any; and here I may\r\nremark that I have frequently heard Maskàt pronounced Mìskit in Arabia\r\namongst the Bedouin of the East.\r\n\r\nWe really did feel very adventurous indeed when we started. I rode my\r\ncamel a quarter of a mile to the foot of the ascent. No one else thought\r\nit worth while to mount, but I was comfortably carried over a muddy\r\ncreek.\r\n\r\nThe Kadhoupers did get some rupees, for we were attended by twelve men\r\ncarrying bamboo poles 10 or 12 feet long.\r\n\r\nIt really was a stiff climb, but we had a good deal of shade, and when we\r\nreached our highest point there was a pretty flat bit with scattered\r\ntrees and grass, about half a mile, I think. The twelve men had to carry\r\nthe baggage slung on the poles for a quarter of a mile or so, where the\r\noverhanging rocks made the path too narrow for loaded camels. It was\r\nquite high enough for their heads, and we had plenty of room. It was\r\nmarvellous to see the camels struggling along this road, and awful to\r\nhear their groans and the shouts of the camel-men as they struggled up\r\nand down and in and out of the rocks; and the hubbub and yelling over a\r\nfallen one was simply diabolical.\r\n\r\nWe had the most tremendous clambering down soon after that, the baggage\r\nbeing again slung on the poles, and the camels came clattering down, with\r\nmany stones, and looking as if they would rush over straight into the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nWhen we got near the sea, say about 50 feet above it, we, on foot,\r\ndiverged from the camel-track, which goes more inland, and followed a\r\nvery, very narrow, washed-away path. This I think must have been the one\r\ndescribed by Wellsted, for we were never, till we reached this part, near\r\nthe sea, though possibly had we fallen we might have rolled over down a\r\nslope.\r\n\r\nThe views inland up the rugged yellow crags, covered with verdure and\r\nstudded with the quaint gouty trees, are weird and extraordinary, and\r\nbelow at our feet the waves dashed up in clouds of white spray. Though we\r\nhad heard much of the difficulties of this road and the dangers for foot\r\npassengers, and we were told of the bleaching bones of the camels which\r\nhad fallen into the abyss below, we experienced none of these hardships.\r\nWe certainly saw the bones of one camel below us, but none of ours\r\nfollowed its example; and we revelled in the beauty of our surroundings,\r\nwhich made us think nothing of the toilsome scramble up and down the\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAs we left the mountain side and approached the plain of Tamarida, we\r\npassed close by what would seem to have been an ancient ruined fort on\r\nthe cliff above the sea, evidently intended to guard this path.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTAMARIDA OR HADIBO\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly Tamarida is a pretty place, with its river, its lagoon, and its\r\npalms, its whitewashed houses and whitewashed mosques, and with its fine\r\nview of the Haghier range immediately behind it. The mosques are new, and\r\noffer but little in the way of architectural beauty, for the fanatical\r\nWahhabi from Nejd swept over the island in 1801, and in their religious\r\nzeal destroyed the places of worship; and the extensive cemeteries still\r\nbear testimony to the ravages of these iconoclasts, with their ruined\r\ntombs and overturned headstones.\r\n\r\nWe encamped on the further side of a good-sized stream or little river,\r\nhaving it between us and the town of Tamarida or Hadibo; and this was\r\nreally a protection to us at night, for the inhabitants of that\r\nneighbourhood are terribly afraid of certain jinni or ghinni, which abide\r\nin the stream, and will not go near it at night. Indeed, we remarked that\r\nit was considered by Hashi and Mahmoud, the two Somali servants, a wise\r\nprecaution to draw all the water and bring up the washing, which was\r\ndrying, in good time of an afternoon.\r\n\r\nThey had heard such fearful stories that they were very much afraid of\r\nbeing bewitched while in the island, though I doubt whether I and my\r\ncamera were not nearly as alarming.\r\n\r\nThey had heard how a Sokotran man had turned a woman of Maskat into a\r\nseal and forced her to swim over to Sokotra in that shape. We were told\r\nthat this story is perfectly true!\r\n\r\nThis evil reputation of the islanders is very persistent. Marco Polo\r\nsays: 'The Sokotrans are enchanters, as great as any in the world, though\r\nexcommunicated by their prelates therefor; and raise winds to bring back\r\nsuch ships as have wronged them, till they obtain satisfaction.'\r\n\r\nIt is only just to say we had no need to fear such honest and friendly\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSultan Salem of Sokotra, the nephew of old Sultan Ali of Kishin, the\r\nmonarch of the Mahri tribe, whom we had visited two years before on the\r\nsouth coast of Arabia, governed the island as his uncle's deputy. He had\r\na castle at Tamarida of very poor and dilapidated appearance, which he\r\nrarely inhabited, preferring to live in the hills near Garriah, or at his\r\nmiserable house at Haula, some eight miles along the coast from Tamarida.\r\nHaula is as ungainly a spot as it is possible to conceive--without water,\r\nwithout wood, and invaded by sand--quite the ugliest place we saw on the\r\nisland, its only recommendation being that during the north-east monsoons\r\nthe few dhows which visit the island anchor there, since it affords some\r\nsort of shelter from the winds in that direction, and Sultan Salem has a\r\nkeen eye to business.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty came to visit us, shortly after our arrival at Tamarida, from\r\nhis country residence, and favoured us with an audience in the courtyard\r\nof his palace, with all the great men of the island seated around him. He\r\nwas a man of fifty, with a handsome but somewhat sinister face; he was\r\ngirt as to his head with a many-coloured _kefieh_, and as to his waist\r\nwith a girdle supporting a finely inlaid Maskat dagger and a sword. His\r\nbody was enveloped in a clean white robe, and his feet were bare.\r\n\r\nHis conversation, both then and when he returned our visit at our camp,\r\non which occasion he received a few presents, was solely about the price\r\nof camels and how many we should need. He did not ask us one other\r\nquestion. He talked little Arabic, being of the Mahri tribe.\r\n\r\nWe gave him an Enfield carbine of 1863.\r\n\r\nOn the plain behind Tamarida there is a conical hill about 200 feet high\r\ncalled Hasan, which has been fortified as an Acropolis, and was provided\r\nwith cemented tanks. These ruins have also been called Portuguese, but\r\nthey looked to us more Arabic in character.\r\n\r\nWhen one has seen the very elaborate forts erected by the Portuguese on\r\nthe coasts of the Persian Gulf and East Africa one feels pretty confident\r\nin asserting that they took no steps to settle themselves permanently in\r\nSokotra; in fact, their occupation of it only extended over a period of\r\nfour years, and the probability is that, finding it harbourless, and\r\nworth little for their purposes of a depôt on the road to India, they\r\nnever thought it worth their while to build any permanent edifices.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood there is a hill where the English are said to have\r\nencamped, and where there are traces of a more ancient civilisation,\r\nprobably Portuguese. There are walls of small stones, cased with cement,\r\nand, inside them, a tank with conduits.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this hill, and across the stream, is a ruined village, only\r\none house of which is still inhabited; it has circular walls and a\r\ncircular paddock adjoining it for cattle.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, annoying to have to add another to the list of the many\r\ntongues spoken in the world, but I think there is no room for doubt that\r\nSokoteri must be added to that already distracting catalogue.\r\n\r\nThough Sokotra has been under Mahri rule probably since before our\r\nera--for Arrian tells us that in his day the island of Dioscorida, as it\r\nwas then called, was under the rule of the king of the Arabian\r\nfrankincense country, and the best days of that country were long before\r\nArrian's time--nevertheless, the inhabitants have kept their language\r\nquite distinct both from Mahri and from Arabic. Of course it is naturally\r\nstrongly impregnated with words from both these tongues; but the\r\nfundamental words of the language are distinct, and in a trilingual\r\nparallel list of close on 300 words, which my husband took down in the\r\npresence of Mahri, Sokoteri and Arabic speaking people on the island, we\r\nfound distinctly more in the language derived from an Arab than from a\r\nMahri source.\r\n\r\nIn subtlety of sound Sokoteri is painfully rich, and we had the greatest\r\ndifficulty in transcribing the words. They corkscrew their tongues, they\r\ngurgle in their throats, and bring sounds from most alarming depths, but\r\nluckily they do not click. They have no word for a dog, for there is not\r\na dog on the island; neither for a horse nor a lion, for the same reason;\r\nthey seemed surprised at the idea that there might be such words in their\r\nlanguage; but for all the animals, trees, and articles commonly found\r\nthere they have words as distinct from the Arabic and Mahri as cheese is\r\nfrom _fromage_.\r\n\r\nAt Tamarida we annexed a respectable man called Ammar as interpreter. He\r\nwas familiar with all the languages spoken in the island, and daily, when\r\nthe camp was all pitched and arranged, my husband used to produce a long\r\nlist of Arabic words, and Ammar used to sit on his heels and tell the\r\nMahri and Sokoteri equivalents, the words, however, being for the most\r\npart shouted out in chorus by numerous bystanders. I have since added the\r\nEnglish, and the vocabulary will be found in an appendix.\r\n\r\nIt was most difficult to get an answer as to anything abstract.\r\n\r\nFor instance, 'clothes' would be asked, and Ammar, after inquiring if\r\nwhite clothes were meant, or blue, or black, or red, and being\r\nanswered 'any clothes,' would give a list of garments of various shapes.\r\n\r\n'Age' was a question that caused a great awkwardness, I am sorry to say.\r\n\r\n'Well,' answered Ammar, 'it might be anything--seven, fifteen,\r\nseventy--anything!'\r\n\r\nAfter the greatest invention and planning on our part, we unhappily\r\nthought to put the question in this form:\r\n\r\n'How do you say \"What is your age?\"'\r\n\r\n'_My_ age,' said Ammar, '_mine_--well'--with evident annoyance and great\r\nhesitation--'I'm thirty-five--_not_ old--not _old_ at all.'\r\n\r\nHe is really quite fifty.\r\n\r\nOn such occasions there had to be a tremendous conversation with the\r\nbystanders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEODORE BENT MAKING THE VOCABULARY AT FEREGHET]\r\n\r\nI will not say more of the language than that instead of our little word\r\n_I_ the Sokoteri is _hemukomòn_ and the Mahri _evomúhshom_.\r\n\r\nI wish we could speak confidently about the origin of the so-called\r\nBedouin, the pastoral inhabitants of the island, who live in the valleys\r\nand heights of Mount Haghier, and wander over the surface of the island\r\nwith their flocks and herds.\r\n\r\nIt has been often asserted that these Bedouin are troglodytes, or\r\ncave-dwellers pure and simple, but I do not think this is substantially\r\ncorrect. None of them, as far as we could ascertain, dwell always or by\r\npreference in caves; but all of them own stone-built tenements, however\r\nhumble, in some warm and secluded valley, and they only abandon these to\r\ndwell in caves when driven to the higher regions in search of pasturage\r\nfor their flocks during the dry season, which lasts from November till\r\nthe south-west monsoon bursts in the beginning of June.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were on the island the season was exceptionally dry, and most\r\nof the villages in the valleys were entirely abandoned for the mountain\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nThe Bedou is decidedly a handsome individual, lithe of limb like his\r\ngoats, and with a _café-au-lait_-coloured skin; he has a sharp profile,\r\nexcellent teeth; he often wears a stubbly black beard and has beautifully\r\npencilled eyebrows, and, though differing entirely in language, in\r\nphysique and type he closely resembles the Bedouin found in the Mahri and\r\nGara mountains. Furthermore, the mode of life is the same--dwelling in\r\ncaves when necessary, but having permanent abodes on the lower lands; and\r\nthey have several other striking points in common. Greetings take place\r\nbetween the Arabian Bedouin and the Sokotran Bedouin in similar fashion,\r\nby touching each cheek and then rubbing the nose. We found the Bedouin of\r\nMount Haghier fond of dancing and playing their _teherane_, and also\r\npeculiarly lax in their religious observances; and though ostensibly\r\nconforming to Mohammedan practice, they observe next to none of their\r\nprecepts; and it is precisely the same with the Bedouin whom we met in\r\nthe Gara mountains. There is certainly nothing African about the Sokotran\r\nBedouin; therefore I am inclined to consider them as a branch of that\r\naboriginal race which inhabited Arabia, with a language of its own; and\r\nwhen Arabia is philologically understood and its various races\r\ninvestigated, I expect we shall hear of several new languages spoken by\r\ndifferent branches of this aboriginal race, and then, perhaps, a parallel\r\nwill be found to the proudly isolated tongue of this remote island.\r\n\r\nThe Bedou houses are round, and surrounded by a round wall in which the\r\nflocks are penned at night; flat-roofed and covered with soil, and inside\r\nthey are as destitute of interest as it is possible to conceive--a few\r\nmats on which the family sleep, a few jars in which they store their\r\nbutter, and a skin churn in which they make the same. The plan of those\r\nhouses that are oblong is that of two circles united by a bit of wall at\r\none side, the door being at the other. In one house into which my husband\r\npenetrated he found a bundle hanging from the ceiling, which he\r\ndiscovered to be a baby by the exposure of one of its little feet.\r\n\r\nEverything is poor and pastoral. The Bedouin have hardly any clothes to\r\ncover themselves with, nothing to keep them warm when the weather is\r\ndamp, save a home-spun sheet, and they have no ideas beyond those\r\nconnected with their flocks. The closest intimacy exists between a Bedou\r\nand his goats and his cows; the animals understand and obey certain calls\r\nwith absolute accuracy, and you generally see a Sokotran shepherdess\r\nwalking before her flock, and not after it. The owners stroke and caress\r\ntheir little cows until they are as tame as dogs.\r\n\r\nThe cows in Sokotra are far more numerous than one would expect, and\r\nthere is excellent pasturage for them; they are a very pretty little\r\nbreed, smaller than our Alderney, without the hump, and with the long\r\ndewlap; they are fat and plump, and excellent milkers.\r\n\r\nThe Bedou does very little in the way of cultivation, but when grass is\r\nscarce, and consequently milk, he turns his attention to the sowing of\r\njowari in little round fields dotted about the valleys, with a wall round\r\nto keep the goats off. In each of these he digs a well, and waters his\r\ncrop before sunrise and after sunset; the field is divided into little\r\ncompartments by stones, the better to retain the soil and water; and\r\nsometimes you will see a Bedou papa with his wife and son sitting and\r\ntilling these _bijou_ fields with pointed bits of wood, for other tools\r\nare unknown to them.\r\n\r\nWe hired our camels for our journey eastwards from the Arab merchants who\r\nlive at Tamarida or Hadibo; they are the sole camel proprietors in the\r\nisland, as the Bedouin own nothing but their flocks; and excellent\r\nanimals these camels are, too, the strongest and tallest we had seen. Of\r\nour camel-men, some were Bedouin and some were negroes, and we found them\r\non the whole honest and obliging, though with the usual keen eye for a\r\npossible bakshish, which is not uncommon elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe eastern end of Sokotra is similar in character to the western, being\r\na low continuation of the spurs of Haghier, intersected with valleys, and\r\nwith a plateau stretching right away to Ras Momi about 1,500 feet above\r\nthe sea-level. This plateau is a perfect paradise for shepherds, with\r\nmuch rich grass all over it; but it is badly watered, and water has to be\r\nfetched from the deep pools which are found in all its valleys at the\r\ndriest season of the year, and in the rainy season these become\r\nimpassable torrents, sweeping trees and rocks before them; and the\r\nhillsides up to the edge of the bare dolomitic pinnacles of the Haghier\r\nrange are thickly clothed with vegetation.\r\n\r\nThree considerable streams run from southward of Mount Haghier,\r\nfertilising three splendid valleys, until the waters, as the sea is\r\napproached, lose themselves in the sand. To the north there are many more\r\nstreams, and inasmuch as the sea is considerably nearer, they all reach\r\nit, or, rather, the silted-up lagoons already alluded to.\r\n\r\nBy the side of these streams innumerable palm-groves grow--in fact, dates\r\nform the staple food of the islanders. And out of the date-tree they get\r\nbranches for their hedges, stems for their roofs; the leaf provides them\r\nwith their sleeping-mats, and, when beaten on stones, with fibre, with\r\nwhich they are exceedingly clever in making ropes. Our camel-men were\r\nalways at it, and produced, with the assistance of fingers and toes, the\r\nmost excellent rope at the shortest possible notice. They also make\r\nstrong girdles with this fibre, which the slaves, who are employed in\r\nfertilising the palm-trees, bind round their bodies and the trees so as\r\nto facilitate their ascent, and provide them with a firm seat when the\r\npoint of operation is reached. They weave, too, baskets, or, rather,\r\nstiff sacks, in which to hang their luggage on either side of the camel.\r\n\r\nA Sokotran camel-man is a most dexterous packer. He must first obliterate\r\nhis camel's hump by placing against it three or four thick felt mats or\r\n_nummuds_, and on this raised surface he builds all his luggage,\r\ncarefully secured in his baskets, with the result that we never, during\r\nany of our expeditions with camels, had so little damage done to our\r\nproperty, even though the roads were so mountainous and the box-bushes\r\nwere constantly rubbing against the loads. The camels are very fine\r\nspecimens of their race, standing considerably higher than the Arabian\r\nanimal, and when mounted on the top of our luggage, above the hump thus\r\nunnaturally raised, we felt at first disagreeably elevated.\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of camels and camel-trappings, I may add that each\r\nowner has his own mark painted and branded on his own property. Some of\r\nthese marks consist purely of Himyaritic letters, whilst others are\r\nvariants, which would naturally arise from copying a very old-world\r\nalphabetic original. I take these marks to be preserved by the steady\r\nconservatism of the Oriental; we copied many of them, and the result\r\nlooks like a partial reproduction of the old Sabæan alphabet, and they\r\nmay be seen in an appendix.\r\n\r\nScattered over Sokotra there are numerous villages, each being a little\r\ncluster of from five to ten round or oblong houses and round cattle-pens.\r\nI was informed by a competent authority on the island that there are four\r\nhundred of these pastoral villages between Ras Kalenzia and Ras Momi, a\r\ndistance of some seventy odd miles as the crow flies; and from the\r\nfrequency with which we came across them during our marches up only a\r\nlimited number of Sokotra's many valleys, I should think the number is\r\nnot over-estimated. If this is so, the population of the island must be\r\nconsiderably over the estimate given, and must approach twelve or\r\nthirteen thousand souls; but owing to the migratory nature of the\r\ninhabitants, and their life half spent in houses and half in caves, any\r\nexact census would be exceedingly hard to obtain. The east of the island\r\nis, however, decidedly more populous than the west, as the water supply\r\nis better. We were constantly passing the little round-housed villages,\r\nwith their palm-groves and their flocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nWE DEPART FOR THE LAND'S END--_i.e._ RAS MOMI\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Tamarida we spent a night at a place the name of which has\r\nbeen variously spelt. We decided to spell it Dihelemnitin. It has\r\notherwise been called Dishelenata, &c. It is a lovely spot, at the\r\nconfluence of two streams in a wood of palms, and we had a nice little\r\nflat field to camp in. When I say a field, I mean a wall-supported place\r\nonce used as such. We saw very little cultivation except gardens at the\r\nvillages, and the palm-trees were for the most part quite neglected. Near\r\nTamarida we saw just a few fan-palms, and one I remember looked very odd,\r\nas it still retained every leaf it had ever had, and looked like a yellow\r\ntower, with the green leaves at the top. All the rest were bristling,\r\nwithered down to the ground.\r\n\r\nIn South Arabia people are punished if they steal each other's\r\npalm-leaves, as the ribs are valuable for many things as well as the\r\nleaves themselves, but here there are no restrictions of that kind.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of climbing up and down to Saièhen, our next camp.\r\nWhile we stayed there my husband went about everywhere that he was told\r\nthere were ruins or supposed inscriptions, but saw nothing worth\r\nmentioning except the inscribed crosses already alluded to.\r\n\r\nAt first, after leaving Saièhen, we kept along the lower ground for some\r\ntime, passing by Garriah Khor, a very long inlet or lagoon which\r\nstretches inland for at least two miles. We dismounted at Dis'hass,\r\nwhere, we were told by Ammar, 'the English once had houses.' It was a\r\nmass of ruins.\r\n\r\nWe went over a pass about 2,500 feet high, and up and down two sets of\r\nhills to a level plain about 1,500 feet high, extending all the way to\r\nRas Momi. As we ascended we passed a peak 2,000 feet high, called\r\nGòdahan, which has a great hole in the middle of it, through which a\r\nlarge patch of sky is visible. We encamped near it, close to the hamlet\r\nof Kit'hab, in a wood of palms and various other trees, full of those\r\npretty green and grey birds, half parrot and half dove, whose beauty,\r\nhowever, did not save them from our pot.\r\n\r\nFrom this place and even before we reached it we had very little personal\r\nuse of our camels, the clambering up as well as down was so severe.\r\n\r\nThere is behind the peak of Gòdahan a curious flat ridge, raised not very\r\nmany feet above the plateau, which is called Matagioti, and is perfectly\r\nhoneycombed with fissures and crevices, offering delightful homes for\r\npeople of troglodytic tendencies. Huge fig-trees grow in these crevices,\r\nand dragon's-blood trees, and large herds of cows and goats revel in the\r\nrich carpet of grass which covers the flat surface of the plateau.\r\nUnfortunately, this rich pasture ground is only indifferently supplied\r\nwith water. We obtained ours from two very nasty holes where rain-water\r\nhad lain, and in which many cattle had washed; and when these dry up the\r\nBedouin have to go down to the lower valleys in search of it. Before we\r\nleft it had assumed the appearance of porter.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal of lavender growing about and numerous pretty\r\nflowers, and we found many shells in that place. It was so very cold that\r\nwe had a fine bonfire to dine by, and the dew that night was drenching,\r\npouring off our tents like rain in the morning.\r\n\r\nAs Ras Momi is approached the country wears a very desolate aspect; there\r\nare no trees here, but low bushes and stunted adeniums covered with\r\nlichen, and looking just like rocks with little bushes on them; very\r\nlittle water, but plenty of grass.\r\n\r\nWe encamped near the hamlet of Saihon, where, though there was no\r\nappearance of a mosque, there was not only a mollah but a doctor. The\r\nformer was so free from fanaticism as to send us a present of a lamb.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants were very friendly to us, and let us go into their houses\r\nand watch their occupations. The women were busy grinding limestone to\r\nmake pots; and we obtained a very dirty little bag full of a kind of\r\norganic substance like small white stones, which is ground to powder,\r\nmixed with water into a whitish paste, which after a little time turns\r\nred. I think they paint the pots with it.\r\n\r\nThey were pleasant looking folk with quite a European cast of\r\ncountenance, mostly ugly, and some with scanty beards, and reminding us\r\nstrongly of the old frieze of the Parthenon sculptures in the Acropolis\r\nMuseum at Athens. Really, they were just like them except for their\r\ncolour, which is chocolate brown. We could not help thinking of the\r\n'Moskophoros' when one came up to look at us with a lamb round his neck.\r\nWe settled there for several days, not being able to go nearer Ras Momi\r\nfor reasons connected with water. I cannot think it could have been\r\nreally pleasant to the people of Saihon that we should have drunk up\r\nnearly all their water, and only left a little the colour of coffee\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\nWe suffered badly while there from two things; firstly from the dreadful\r\nkind of grass upon which we were encamped, and secondly from a regular\r\ngale of wind.\r\n\r\nThe grass, a _pennisetum_ I believe, is one we knew and hated in\r\nMashonaland. The seed is like a little grain of very sharp oats, well\r\nbarbed, which carries behind it into your clothes a thread like a\r\nfish-hook, about 2 inches long.\r\n\r\nAs for the wind, when we came home one afternoon we found Matthaios in a\r\nmost dreadful state, fearing the tents would be down. He was trying to\r\nget the outer flies off alone, and was delighted when my husband and I,\r\nthe only two other experienced tent-dwellers, came to his assistance. For\r\ndays we might as well have lived in a drum, for the noise of this\r\ntempest.\r\n\r\nThere was a little round enclosure to keep goats in; we knew that Hashi\r\nand Mahmoud had taken this as their home, and we were satisfied that no\r\nmatter which way the wind blew they were sheltered; but one evening\r\nbefore dinner we heard that Mahmoud was ill with fever. We both went to\r\nsee that he was comfortable, and my husband took him some quinine.\r\n\r\nWe found Hashi had put him to bed on the windy side of the enclosure,\r\nwith a hard, stiff camel-mat under him, one over his body, and a third on\r\nhis head. We soon moved him and wrapped him in blankets, and my husband\r\nhaving got some sacks and other things as a pillow, Hashi put them on the\r\ntop of Mahmoud's head. We built up a waterproof tent over him, but soon\r\nhad to unpack him, as the village doctor appeared on the scene, demanding\r\na fee of two annas from my husband.\r\n\r\nHe began by making several slashes on the top of his head and cupping him\r\nwith a horn, which he sucked, gave him some medicine, and having spent a\r\nlittle time blowing in different directions, settled down, crouching over\r\nthe patient, waving his hand as if making passes to mesmerise him, and\r\nmuttering a few words alternately with spitting, slightly and often, in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nOur joint efforts were successful in the recovery of Mahmoud, who was\r\nwell next day.\r\n\r\nIt is curious that in this somewhat wild and at present uninteresting\r\nlocality we found more traces of ruins and bygone habitations than are\r\nfound in any other part of the island. About five miles from Ras Momi,\r\nand hidden by an amphitheatre of low hills on the watershed between the\r\ntwo seas, we came across the foundations of a large square building,\r\nconstructed out of very large stones, and with great regularity. It was\r\n105 feet square; the outer wall was 6 feet thick, and it was divided\r\ninside into several compartments by transverse walls. To the south-east\r\ncorner was attached an adjunct, 14 by 22 feet. There was very little soil\r\nin this building; and nothing whatever save the foundations to guide us\r\nin our speculations as to what this could be. Other ruins of a ruder and\r\nmore irregular character lay scattered in the vicinity, and at some\r\nremote period, when Sokotra was in its brighter days, this must have been\r\nan important centre of civilisation.\r\n\r\nNone of the natives would help us to dig in this place. They are very\r\nmuch afraid of the Devil, and think the ground under the ruins is hollow\r\nand that there is a house in it. At one time hopes were held out that the\r\nsacrifice of a goat might avert danger, but, after all, we and Matthaios\r\nhad to do the best we could in the way of digging. We always carried\r\ntools with us. My part consisted in tracing out the walls with the trowel\r\nand moving stones.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I found it most difficult next day to take the\r\nmeasurements in the high wind.\r\n\r\nFrom Saihon my husband climbed up a steep and rugged mountain to a ruined\r\nvillage on a strong place called Zerug. Ammar's family mansion was near:\r\na cave containing three women, some children, and large flocks of goats,\r\nkept in the cave by a wall; it is heated at night, and very stuffy.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this corner of the island we journeyed to the edge of the\r\nplateau and looked down the steep cliffs at the eastern cape, where Ras\r\nMomi pierces, with a series of diminishing heights, the Indian Ocean. The\r\nwaves were dashing over the remains of the wreck, still visible, of a\r\nGerman vessel which went down here with all hands some few years ago, and\r\nthe Bedouin produced for our edification several fragments of German\r\nprint, which they had treasured up, and which they deemed of fabulous\r\nvalue. Ras Momi somewhat reminded us of Cape Finisterre, in Brittany, and\r\nas a dangerous point for navigation it also resembles it closely. Near\r\nthe summit of one hill we passed an ancient and long disused reservoir,\r\ndug in the side of it, and constructed with stones; and during our stay\r\nhere we visited the sites of many ancient villages, and found the cave\r\ncharnel-houses already alluded to.\r\n\r\nWe lunched in a sort of cave, behind some huts on the opposite side of\r\nthe valley, if such it may be called, from the bone caves, and were put\r\nto the rout by a serpent, which evidently liked the water in a little\r\nrocky pit in the mouth of the cave. It was horrible stuff, but we had\r\nbrought water for our tea with us. Our supposed foe was slain. The\r\nserpent was very pretty, fully a yard long, black and salmon-coloured,\r\nand with a very tapering head and tail. It was said to be poisonous, but\r\nwe thought it could not be.\r\n\r\nThe hills all about Ras Momi are divided into irregular plots by long\r\npiles of stones stretching in every direction, certainly not the work of\r\nthe Sokotrans of to-day, but the work of some people who valued every\r\ninch of ground, and utilised it for some purpose or other. The miles of\r\nwalls we passed here, and rode over with our camels, give to the country\r\nsomewhat the aspect of the Yorkshire wolds. It has been suggested that\r\nthey were erected as divisions for aloe-grounds; but I think if this was\r\nthe case traces of aloes would surely be found here still. Aloes are\r\nstill abundant about Fereghet and the valleys of Haghier, but near Ras\r\nMomi there are none, and it is hard to think what else could grow there\r\nnow; but these mountain slopes may not always have been so denuded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nMOUNT HAGHIER AND FEREGHET\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter leaving our camp at Saihon we took a path in a south-westerly\r\ndirection, and after a few days of somewhat monotonous travelling we came\r\nagain into the deeper valleys and finer scenery of the central districts\r\nof the island. Through them we made our way in the direction of Mount\r\nHaghier.\r\n\r\nSokotra without Mount Haghier would be like a body without a soul. The\r\ngreat mass of mountains which occupies the centre of the island rises in\r\nmany jagged and stupendous peaks to the height of nearly 5,000 feet. At\r\nall seasons of the year it catches the fugitive sea mists which so rarely\r\nvisit the Arabian coasts, and down its sides flow sparkling streams and\r\nbubbling cascades. The Ghebel Bit Molek (a name which, by the way, sounds\r\nas if it had an Assyrian origin) is the highest peak. It is very sheer\r\nand unapproachable at its summit, and though only 4,900 feet high will\r\ngive trouble to the adventurous crag-climber who is bent on conquering\r\nit. Then there are the Driat peaks, the Adouna peaks, and many others\r\npiercing the sky like needles, around which wild goats and civet cats\r\nroam, but no other big game.\r\n\r\nIn the lower ground are found quantities of wild donkeys, which, the\r\nBedouin complained, were in the habit of trampling upon and killing their\r\ngoats. Whether these donkeys are naturally wild or descendants of escaped\r\ntamed ones I am unable to say. Some are dark and some are white, and\r\ntheir skins seemed to be more glossy than those of the domestic moke. The\r\nBedouin like to catch them if they can, with the hope of taming them for\r\ndomestic use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VEGETATION IN SOKOTRA]\r\n\r\nThe glory of Mount Haghier is undoubtedly its dragon's-blood tree\r\n(_Dracænia cinnabari_), found scattered at an elevation of about 1,000\r\nfeet and upwards over the greater part of Sokotra. Certainly it is the\r\nquaintest tree imaginable, from 20 feet to 30 feet high, exactly like a\r\ngreen umbrella which is just in the process of being blown inside out, I\r\nthought. One of our party thought them like huge green toadstools,\r\nanother like trees made for a child's Noah's Ark. The gum was called\r\n_kinnàbare_, but the Arab name is _kàtir_. The Sokoteri name is _edah_.\r\n\r\nIt is a great pity that the Sokotrans of to-day do not make more use of\r\nthe rich ruby-red gum which issues from its bark when punctured, and\r\nwhich produces a valuable resin, now used as varnish; but the tree is now\r\nfound in more enterprising countries--in Sumatra, in South America, and\r\nelsewhere. So the export of dragon's blood from its own ancient home is\r\nnow practically _nil_.\r\n\r\nIf the dragon's-blood tree, with its close-set, radiating branches and\r\nstiff, aloe-like leaves, is quaint--and some might be inclined to say\r\nugly--it has, nevertheless, its economic use; but not so its still\r\nquainter comrade on the slopes of Mount Haghier, the gouty,\r\nswollen-stemmed _Adenium_. This, I think, is the ugliest tree in\r\ncreation, with one of the most beautiful of flowers: it looks like one of\r\nthe first efforts of Dame Nature in tree-making, happily abandoned by her\r\nfor more graceful shapes and forms. The swollen and twisted contortions\r\nof its trunk recall with a shudder those miserable sufferers from\r\nelephantiasis; its leaves are stiff and formal, and they usually drop\r\noff, as if ashamed of themselves, before the lovely flower, like a\r\nrich-coloured, large oleander blossom, comes out. The adenium bears some\r\nslight resemblance, on a small scale, to the unsightly baobab-tree of\r\nAfrica, though it tapers much more rapidly, and looks as if it belonged\r\nto a different epoch of creation to our own trees at home.\r\n\r\nThen there is the cucumber-tree, another hideous-stemmed tree, swollen\r\nand whitish; and the hill-slopes covered with this look as if they had\r\nbeen decorated with so many huge composite candles which had guttered\r\nhorribly. At the top of the candle are a few short branches, on which\r\ngrow a few stiff crinkly leaves and small yellow flowers, which produce\r\nthe edible fruit. This tree, in Sokoteri _kamhàn_, the _Dendrosicyos\r\nSocotrana_ of the botanist, is like the language of the Bedouin, found\r\nonly on Sokotra, and is seldom more than 10 or 12 feet in height. It is a\r\nfavourite perch for three or four of the white vultures which swarm in\r\nthe island, and the picture formed by these ungainly birds on the top of\r\nthis ungainly tree is an odd one.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Mount Haghier one comes across valleys entirely full of\r\nfrankincense-trees, with rich red leaves, like autumn tints, and clusters\r\nof blood-red flowers. No one touches the trees here, and this natural\r\nproduct of the island is now absolutely ignored. Then there are the\r\nmyrrhs, also ignored, and other gum-producing plants; and the gnarled\r\ntamarinds, affording lovely shade, and the fruit of which the natives,\r\noddly enough, do know the value of, and make a cooling drink therewith.\r\nThen there are the tree-euphorbias, which look as if they were trying to\r\nmimic the dragon's blood, the branches of which the natives throw into\r\nthe lagoons so that the fish may be killed, and the poisonous milky juice\r\nof which they rub on the bottoms of their canoes to prevent leakage.\r\n\r\nSuch are among the oddest to look upon of Sokotra's vegetable\r\nproductions. Wild oranges, too, are found on Mount Haghier, of a very\r\nrich yellow when ripe, but bitter as gall to eat; and the wild\r\npomegranate, with its lovely red flowers and small yellow fruit, the\r\nflannelly coating of which only is eaten, instead of the seeds, as is the\r\ncase with the cultivated one.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable world is indeed richly represented in this remote island,\r\nand one could not help thinking what possibilities it would offer for the\r\ncultivation of lucrative plants, such as tobacco, which is now grown by\r\nthe natives in small quantities, as is also cotton; and perhaps coffee\r\nand tea would thrive on the higher elevations.\r\n\r\nThe Bedouin would bring us aloes both in leaf and in solution, in hopes\r\nthat we might take a fancy to this venerable Sokotran production. Now a\r\nvery little of it is collected, and everybody takes what he likes from\r\nthe nearest source, whereas, I believe, in former times, when aloes were\r\nan object of commerce here, the plantations were strictly divided off by\r\nwalls, and the owners jealously looked after their property.\r\n\r\nThe way the aloe-juice is collected is this. As the Abyssinians do when\r\nthey are going to wash clothes the aloe-gatherers dig a hole in the\r\nground and line it with a skin. Then they pile old leaves, points\r\noutward, all round till the pressure makes the juice exude. This at first\r\nis called _taïf diho_, or _riho_, both of the latter words used for\r\nwater, though the former is the most usual. It is left till it is firmer\r\nand drier, and this takes about a month. Then it is called _taïf\r\ngeshisha_. When it has dried for about six weeks it is nearly hard, and\r\ncalled _taïf kasahal_. It is exported in skins. The collection of\r\ndragon's blood is carried on just like that of the mastic in Chios. The\r\ndrops are knocked off into bags. The drops which come off unbroken are\r\nthe most valued, and called _edah amsello_. Then the nice, clean, broken\r\nbits are picked out, and called _edah dakkah_; the refuse, with bits of\r\ndirt, bark, and leaves stuck in it, _edah_. This is made up into cakes\r\nwith a little resin and sold very cheap.\r\n\r\nMy husband as usual made a botanical collection, and I believe it\r\ncontained a few novelties; but for further particulars on the flora of\r\nSokotra and the trees thereof I must refer you to Professor Bailey\r\nBalfour's very huge and equally interesting book. We were so fortunate as\r\nto have it with us, and it added much to our pleasure.\r\n\r\nOur way was over broken ground, with little of interest save the lovely\r\nviews over mountain and gorge and the many dragon, frankincense, and\r\nmyrrh trees, past an open space in which is the village of Jahaida, where\r\nthe inhabitants had cultivated some little fields, to Röshi, where there\r\nwas no village but a good deal of water. We encamped in a cattle-pen, the\r\ncamel-men making themselves a capital house with floors, walls, and sides\r\nof the thick mats of the camels. These mats are really like hard\r\nmattresses, nearly 1 inch thick, and very stiff, about 1 yard long by 2\r\nfeet wide.\r\n\r\nWe always tried to encamp in a field if we could, as then we were sure of\r\nsome earth for the tent-pegs. After three days, during which I do not\r\nthink our guides knew their way very well, we went over a steep pass, up\r\nand down, into the deep valley of Es'hab. We had wandered about a good\r\ndeal backwards and forwards over stony wolds, and the men all disagreed\r\nas to the direction, and we had scrambled up a valley off our road to see\r\nsome supposed inscriptions, a much more dangerous place than the Kadhoup\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nThe Es'hab valley, with its rich red stone dotted with green and its\r\nweird trees, forms an admirable foreground to the blue pinnacles of\r\nHaghier--tropical and Alpine at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe climbing was most tremendous, up first and then down very steeply,\r\nall over large sharp loose stones, till we reached the water, the\r\ncamel-men leaning backwards holding their camels by their tails with\r\nall their might by way of putting on the drag. When we reached the valley\r\nwe gladly mounted our camels, and squeezed through woods, and often were\r\nnearly torn off. We encamped in a sweet place, with a stream and shade\r\nand a most fragrant carpet of basil, some of which we had in our soup,\r\nand some of which was carried on for future use. We found the management\r\nof our milk-tins rather difficult. We often had to resort to them, for,\r\nsurrounded though we were by herds of cattle, the supply of fresh milk\r\nwas very irregular: sometimes we could have more than we wanted and at\r\nothers none at all. It is pretty dear, too, in Sokotra, as so much is\r\nused up for the _ghi_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BREAKWATER AT FEREGHET]\r\n\r\nOn January 17 we forced our way on through more woods, the peak of Toff\r\nseeming to fill up the end of the valley, to the Wadi Dishel, and crossed\r\nover to the Wadi Dikadik, where we settled near a wide river in a\r\nbeautiful grassy spot, with many trees entwined with monkey-ropes,\r\nrejoicing that on the following day we should reach Fereghe, or Fereghet,\r\nwhere we intended to rest some time. We had heard from Ammar a delightful\r\ndescription of it, and as we have so often been disappointed under such\r\ncircumstances we said we would take all possible enjoyment out of the\r\npleasures of hope beforehand. But really this time we had everything we\r\nexpected, including a wide rocky river, enabling us to bathe, develop\r\nphotographs, and set up a laundry.\r\n\r\nFereghet was, in fact, a most charming spot. Here our tents were pitched\r\nbeneath wide-spreading tamarinds, and we could walk in shade for a\r\nconsiderable distance under these gigantic old trees. Fereghet, moreover,\r\nwas the site of an ancient ruined town which interested us exceedingly:\r\nwalls, 8 to 10 feet thick, had been constructed out of very large unhewn\r\nboulders externally, filled with rubble, to check the torrent, which in\r\nthe rainy season rushes down here carrying all before it to the sea.\r\nThese walls, showing much skill in keeping a straight line, are clearly\r\nthe work of an age long gone by, when weight-moving was better understood\r\nthan it is at present, and doubtless the ruins of Fereghet may be traced\r\nback to the days when Sokotra was resorted to for its gums. The fine old\r\ntamarind-trees had done much to destroy the colossal wall, only about 100\r\nfeet of which now remains, still about 5 feet high; but there are many\r\nother traces of ruins and a small fort of later date. It is likely enough\r\nthat Fereghet was a great centre of the trade of the island, for\r\nfrankincense, myrrh, and dragon's blood grow copiously around, and the\r\nposition under the slopes of Haghier, and almost in the middle of the\r\nisland, was suitable for such a town.\r\n\r\nWe opened a tomb not very far from Fereghet with a great block of stone\r\nover it, 6 feet long by 3 feet thick; but the ill-conditioned relatives\r\nof the deceased had placed nothing therein save the corpse; and we were\r\nannoyed not to find any trace of inscriptions near this ruined town,\r\nwhich might have thrown some light on the subject. All I feel sure of is\r\nthat the Portuguese did not build this town, as it is commonly asserted.\r\nIn fact we did not see any building on the island which can definitely be\r\nascribed to that nation.\r\n\r\nBelow Fereghet the valley gets broader and runs straight down to the sea\r\nat the south of the island, where the streams from Mount Haghier all lose\r\nthemselves in a vast plain of sand called Noget, which we could see from\r\nthe mountains up which we climbed.\r\n\r\nThis is the widest point of the island of Sokotra, and it is really only\r\nthirty-six miles between the ocean at Tamarida and the ocean at Noget,\r\nbut the intervention of Mount Haghier and its ramifications make it\r\nappear a very long way indeed.\r\n\r\nThe island to the east and to the west of its great mountain very soon\r\nloses its fantastic scenery and its ample supply of water. The most\r\nremarkable peak we could see from Fereghet was Adouna. The topmost point\r\nof this mountain is split. We saw this clearly afterwards, when we\r\ncontinued our journey up the valley, but from Fereghet, I found it out by\r\nseeing a small cloud passing through it. To look at the mountains you\r\nwould think they were made of black stone with a few patches of red\r\nlichen, but really these patches of red are the natural rock showing\r\namongst the fine black lichen which covers the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe channels of the water in the river-bed are shown by this blackness,\r\nand the water looks like an inky stream.\r\n\r\nBeyond Fereghet we were near a river the water of which was very low. The\r\nmain bed of the water-channel was all black, and above this was a coat of\r\nwhite over the blackened stones, and as the remaining pools were all\r\nwhite, I suppose that some white tributary continues flowing later than\r\nthe black stream.\r\n\r\nThe few Bedouin who live round Fereghet were in constant contact with our\r\ncamp, as you will understand when you know that our tent was pitched\r\nexactly on their high road--a little narrow path. They behaved most\r\nkindly in going aside. The women used to bring us aloe plants just torn\r\nup, and seemed much disappointed at finding that we did not find any use\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nWe heard from them that there is only one leper on the island and he\r\nlives alone in the hills.\r\n\r\nOur sheltering tamarind-trees, wide-spreading and gnarled, abounded in\r\ndoves; some were small ones like ours, and some of the parrot kind, whose\r\ncawing was far from sedative. We enjoyed wandering in the shade of the\r\nfig-trees, wild and unprofitable, the date and other trees. Around us\r\nstood the relics of a bygone race of men, who had ill-naturedly left us\r\nno inscriptions on stone, and no clue to tell us who they were.\r\nMountains hemmed us in on every side, and any little wind was very\r\nrefreshing, for we were only about 400 feet above the sea-level, and\r\nquite sheltered from our now only too-well-known north-east monsoon. On a\r\nkind of promontory by a deep pool in the river is a building of stones\r\nand mortar, later in style than the wall and equally inexplicable,\r\nprobably a fort.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe the fantastic beauty of the delightful\r\nFereghet. We were quite sorry to leave it on January 24. We rode a little\r\nway along the river, passing a single fan-palm-tree, very tall and bare,\r\nand then had another great climb up and down. We passed a good many old\r\ntombs, which had been opened. They were made of large slabs. We found one\r\nin the evening not far from our camp, so we opened it the following\r\nmorning before starting. After a great deal of trouble with the pickaxes\r\nand crowbar nothing was found but bones. We measured the top stone, 6\r\nfeet 5 inches by 2 feet 10 inches and 1 foot 5 inches thick.\r\n\r\nWe next scrambled up a wooded mountain, steep enough, but nothing to the\r\ndownward scramble. There was no particular road: one had to stick one's\r\nheels into trailing masses of sharp chips and blocks of red stone and let\r\nthem slide as short a way as they would. The booted portion of our party\r\nbegan to feel great anxiety as to foot-gear. We wondered if our boots\r\ncould possibly last to Tamarida where we had left a good deal of baggage,\r\n_i.e._ clothes that we had needed on the steamer. We used to apply the\r\ngums of various trees to the soles and toes to retard consumption. The\r\ncamels sat down and slid, or looked as if they were doing so; the\r\ncamel-men, holding the tails, nearly lay on their backs; but we reached\r\nthe river safely, encamped there, and rode most of next day up a valley,\r\ncrossing the water often. We had to wind in and out of clumps of trees,\r\nsometimes lying on our camels to get under branches, and finally,\r\nafter going through thick woods, stopped at the foot of some mighty\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\nThough many of our camps on Mount Haghier and the expeditions therefrom\r\nwere very delightful, I think this one, called Yehazahaz, was decidedly\r\nthe prettiest. It was low down on the southern slope of Mount Haghier;\r\nour tents were pitched in a grove of palm-trees at the meeting of two\r\nrushing streams; tangled vegetation hung around us on every side, and\r\nwhichever way we looked we had glimpses of granite peaks and rugged\r\nhill-sides clad with dragon's-blood. The village was quite hidden by\r\ntrees and creepers, but its inhabitants were away on the higher\r\npasturage, and our men occupied the empty tenements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGON'S-BLOOD TREES AT YEHAZAHAZ]\r\n\r\nWe stayed there a couple of days, and the first evening as we were\r\nsitting in our tent after tea, a tremendous noise and shouting proceeded\r\nfrom the direction of our kitchen. This proved to be occasioned by the\r\ndiscovery of some long-suspected sugar thieves. They were the three\r\nyoungest of our camel-drivers. They were all tied to a palm-tree with\r\ntheir arms round it, and Ammar began scourging them with a rope. I begged\r\nthem off; my husband thought I had been foolish, particularly as the\r\nscourging had not been ordered by him. The boys certainly did not seem to\r\nmind it a bit. However, the elder men consulted and Ammar brought a rupee\r\nnext morning as a fine, which my husband thought it right to accept.\r\n\r\nThe red mountains here assume a greyish-white appearance. The land shells\r\nseemed to grow larger on the tops of the mountains. We found some about 3\r\ninches in length.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Yehazahaz there was no riding for us, but a climb afoot\r\nstraight up a steep pass and down across a river and over a second pass.\r\nThe way was mostly rough and through woods, but there were a few little\r\ngrassy bits. We descended only about 100 feet and pitched our tents on a\r\nflattish, spongy piece of grass, near a pretty streamlet overhung with\r\nbegonias and many other flowers, at a spot called Adahan, where a sort of\r\npass winds its way between the granite peaks. We were encamped for\r\nseveral days at an elevation of close on 3,000 feet above the sea-level.\r\nHere, when the mist came down upon us, we were enveloped in clouds, rain,\r\nand wretchedness; but the air to us was cool and invigorating, though I\r\nfear our scantily clad attendants found it anything but agreeable.\r\n\r\nThere were drawbacks, too, to the enjoyment of our mountain camps in the\r\nshape of several kinds of pernicious grasses, which grew thickly round\r\nour tent, and the seeds of which penetrated relentlessly into everything.\r\nGrass thorns invaded our day and night raiment, getting into places\r\nhitherto deemed impregnable, and the prickly sensation caused by them was\r\nirritating to both body and mind.\r\n\r\nFrom Adahan one could easily ascend to the highest ground; though perhaps\r\none ought not to say easily, for climbing is no joke up here, through\r\ndense vegetation and rocky gullies. Looking down into the gorges, we\r\nenjoyed some splendid effects, and were constantly reminded of the Grand\r\nCorral of Madeira.\r\n\r\nThere were many trees and flowering shrubs, rocky needles, and pinnacles\r\nall around us, and a view of the ocean to the north; and by climbing up\r\nwe could catch sight of the ocean to southward too.\r\n\r\nMy husband tried to ascend the highest peak in the island--Driate it is\r\ncalled by the Bedouin--but when he had gone as far as possible the peak\r\nsoared above him about 400 feet sheer and impracticable, quite bare of\r\nvegetation. An Alpine Club would find plenty of amusement in Sokotra. The\r\nbottoms and sides of the valleys, filled with bulbous plants and rank\r\nvegetation, enormous dragon's-blood-trees, the long valleys of Fereghet\r\nand Yehazahaz winding their way to the coast, the rugged mass of Bit\r\nMolek, and the view over both seas make, my husband said, as interesting\r\na natural view as it is possible to conceive. The clouds had fortunately\r\nrolled themselves up for the occasion.\r\n\r\nWe had, however, during our stay so much wet that we had a special fire\r\nto dine by, and by it a very rudely constructed clothes-horse to dry our\r\ndripping garments. Our kitchen fire was the constant resort of the\r\nBedouin of the neighbourhood, coming to see us and bring provisions to\r\nsell. We had plenty of milk and one day bought a tiny calf for three\r\nrupees. The camel-men who skinned it tried to keep the head as their\r\nperquisite, but Matthaios secured it and put it in our soup. To our\r\nsurprise the two Somali servants, Hashi and Mahmoud, would in consequence\r\neat none of the soup nor any meat. They usually ate anything that was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nA lame Bedou brought us some green oranges and potatoes, which were\r\nreally the roots of a convolvulus: they were not bad when baked in the\r\nashes, but hard when boiled. He also brought us a sweet herb which they\r\nuse to stuff pillows with. The greetings of the Bedou always amuse us;\r\nthey first put cheek to cheek and then rub noses in the most\r\nmatter-of-fact way, so we may infer that this mode of salutation is in\r\nvogue in the Mahra country. It was pleasant to be among such friendly\r\npeople, who had no horror of us and did not even seem much surprised at\r\nseeing us there, and to be able to go off quite alone for a scramble so\r\nsafely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nBACK TO THE OCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter several days at Adahan we climbed down northward. Our journey was\r\nonly three miles along a very narrow valley, but we made much more of it\r\nclimbing after plants and shells. We stopped at the first little flat\r\nplace that would hold our tents, a sort of small shelf more than\r\nknee-deep in that awful grass; and though we really enjoyed that camp for\r\ntwo days, pain was our portion all the time. The scenery was magnificent,\r\nand all the more striking that the mountains, having cast off their\r\nlichen covering, gleamed out in their glowing red. All round us there was\r\nsuch steepness that it was a work of great difficulty to set up my camera\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nWe had a very steep descent after that over sharp stones to the plain, my\r\nhusband and I, as usual, when on foot, starting before the others, and\r\nthough we were sorry when we finally quitted the mountains, we were glad\r\nenough to find ourselves on our camels again, to be carried to Suk, where\r\nwe decided to stay, as we heard that the sultan's boat was there and the\r\nsultan himself was not so very far off. We wished to engage the ship for\r\nour return to Aden.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the s.s. _Canara_ my husband had begged the captain to\r\ntake a letter to Bombay requesting that the B.I.S.N. Co. would send a\r\nsteamer for us, and let us know about it by some dhow. A dhow had arrived\r\nfrom Bombay with no letter for us, but with news of the plague: so we\r\nbecame afraid that if the plague prevented the steamer from coming and\r\nwe waited for it, we might have to stick on Sokotra during the whole of\r\nthe south-west monsoon. My husband therefore began parleying about\r\nsailing-boats and had sent Ammar from Adahan, and the sultan had sent his\r\ncaptain up to meet us.\r\n\r\nDr. Schweinfurth sees in the present name of Sokotra a Hindoo origin, and\r\nthe survival of the Hindoo name Diu Sukutura, which the Greeks, after\r\ntheir easy-going fashion, changed into Dioscorides. This is very\r\ningenious and most likely correct. When the Portuguese reached the island\r\nin 1538, they found the Arab sheikh dwelling at the capital called Zoko,\r\nnow in ruins, and still called Suk, a survival doubtless of the original\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe old capital of Zoko is a delicious spot, and the ruins are buried in\r\ngroves of palm-trees by the side of a large and deep lagoon of fresh\r\nwater; this lagoon is only separated from the sea by a narrow belt of\r\nsand and shingle, and it seems to me highly probable that this was the\r\nancient harbour where the boats in search of the precious products of the\r\nisland found shelter. The southern coast of Arabia affords many instances\r\nof these silted harbours, and the northern coast of Sokotra is similar,\r\nmany of the lagoons, or _khors_ as they call them, being deep and running\r\nover a mile inland. The view at Suk over the wide lagoon fringed with\r\npalm groves, on to the jagged heights of Mount Haghier rising immediately\r\nbehind, is, I think, to be placed amongst the most enchanting pictures I\r\nhave ever seen.\r\n\r\nExtensive excavation at Suk might probably bring to light some\r\ninteresting relics of the earlier inhabitants of this island, but it\r\nwould have to be deep, as later edifices have been erected here; and\r\nlabour and tools would have to be brought from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe present capital is called Tamarida by Arabs and foreigners, and\r\nHadibo by the natives, and its construction is quite of a modern date;\r\nthe name is apparently a Latinised form of the Arabic _tamar_, or date\r\nfruit, which tree is largely cultivated there.\r\n\r\nMuch is said by old writers about the Greek colonists who came to Sokotra\r\nin ancient times, but I cannot help thinking that the Hellenic world\r\nnever carried its enterprise much in this direction, for, if the Greeks\r\ndid, they have left no trace whatsoever of their existence there.\r\n\r\nI should think few places in the world have pursued the even tenor of\r\ntheir way over so many centuries as Sokotra has. Yakut, writing seven\r\nhundred years ago, speaks of the Arabs as ruling here; the author of the\r\n'Periplus' more than one thousand years ago tells us the same thing; and\r\nnow we have a representative of the same country and the same race\r\ngoverning the island still.\r\n\r\nSokotra has followed the fortunes of Arabia; throughout, the same\r\npolitical and religious influences which have been at work in Arabia have\r\nbeen felt here. Sokotra, like Arabia, has gone through its several stages\r\nof Pagan, Christian, and Mohammedan beliefs.\r\n\r\nThe first time the island came in contact with modern ideas and modern\r\ncivilisation was when the Portuguese occupied it in 1538, and this was,\r\nas we have seen, ephemeral. Then the island fell under the rod of Wahabi\r\npersecution at the beginning of this century, as did nearly the whole of\r\nArabia in those days. In 1835 it was for a short time brought under\r\ndirect British influence, and Indian troops encamped on the plain of\r\nTamarida. It was then uncertain whether Aden or Sokotra would be chosen\r\nas a coaling station for India, and Lieutenant Wellsted was sent in the\r\n_Palinurus_ to take a survey of it; but doubtless the harbourless\r\ncondition of the island, and the superior position of Aden in that\r\nrespect, caused the decision in favour of Aden.\r\n\r\nThe advantages Aden afforded for fortification and for commanding the\r\nmouth of the Red Sea influenced the decision, and Sokotra, with its fair\r\nmountains and rich fertility, was again allowed to relapse into its\r\npristine state of quiescence, and the British soldier was condemned to\r\nsojourn on the barren, burning rocks of Aden, instead of in this island\r\nparadise.\r\n\r\nFinally, in 1876, to prevent the island being acquired by any other\r\nnation, the British Government entered into a treaty with the sultan, by\r\nwhich the latter gets 360 dollars a year, and binds himself and his heirs\r\nand successors, 'amongst other things, to protect any vessel, foreign or\r\nBritish, with the crew, passengers, and cargo, that may be wrecked on the\r\nisland of Sokotra and its dependencies,' and it is understood that the\r\nisland is never to be ceded to a foreign power without British consent.\r\n\r\nA more peaceful, law-abiding people it would be hard to find\r\nelsewhere--such a sharp contrast to the tribes on the South Arabian\r\ncoast. They seem never to quarrel amongst themselves, as far as we could\r\nsee, and the few soldiers Sultan Salem possesses have a remarkably easy\r\ntime of it. Our luggage was invariably left about at night without anyone\r\nto protect it, and none of it was stolen, and after our journeys in\r\nSouthern Arabia the atmosphere of security was exceedingly agreeable.\r\n\r\nThe only thieves were the white and yellow vultures who sat on guard\r\naround our kitchen and were always ready to carry off our meat, and made\r\nmany valiant attempts to do so.\r\n\r\nMoney is scarce in the island, and so are jealousies, and probably the\r\nBedouin of Sokotra will remain in their bucolic innocence to the end of\r\ntime, if no root of bitterness in the shape of modern civilisation is\r\nplanted amongst them.\r\n\r\nIt is undoubtedly a providential thing for the Sokotran that his island\r\nis harbourless, that his mountains are not auriferous, and that the\r\nmodern world is not so keen about dragon's-blood, which is still called\r\n'the blood of two brothers,' frankincense and myrrh, as the ancients\r\nwere. A thing we regretted very much in leaving Sokotra was the\r\ndelightful peace of travelling without an armed escort, which we had not\r\nenjoyed for years; we knew we should soon be travelling again with\r\nsoldiers in Arabia.\r\n\r\nThere is a wretched hamlet of Somali at Suk, which had been visited by us\r\nfrom Hadibo. We had only one night at Suk, and in the morning my husband\r\nand Matthaios went off on foot to Haulah or Haulaf to see the boat. This\r\nis where the sultan lives. I believe the boat was actually at Khor\r\nDilisha. They did not think it would have been so far or they would have\r\ntaken camels. It was a three-mile tramp in the sand.\r\n\r\nMy husband and Matthaios came back from Haulah very hot and tired, not\r\nhaving seen the sultan; he was sleeping or praying all the time, the mode\r\nin which Moslems say 'not at home'--in short he was keeping out of the\r\nway. They described the boat as everything that was delightful, though\r\npeople not so well accustomed as we were to voyaging in these ships might\r\nnot agree with them, but it was impossible to come to terms. They had had\r\na very stormy interview with the sultan's captain, who said that 1,000\r\nrupees was the lowest price. My husband said he had paid no more for the\r\nsteamer, and we had all had beds provided and food; 800 was his highest\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThe sultan has a miserable house in a very uncomfortable spot, surrounded\r\nby a few huts belonging to fishermen, who go out on little rafts made of\r\nbundles of palm-leaf ribs to drop the traps for fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HAGHIER MOUNTAINS FROM SUK\r\n\r\n(_From a water-colour sketch by Theodore Bent_)]\r\n\r\nWe then moved to Hadibo again, going along the shore, and encamping quite\r\nin a different place to that in which we were at first; we were in a nice\r\ndate grove by the lagoon and close to the beach. We now commenced a\r\ntime of dreadful uncertainty as to how or when we could leave the island.\r\n\r\nHearing nothing from the sultan, Matthaios was sent on a camel to offer\r\n800 rupees, and returned most indignant, 2,000 being the lowest price\r\nasked, _i.e._ 124_l._ Later the captain came, agreed to the 800, and said\r\nmy husband must pay 400 at sunset to get wood and water. As the men never\r\ncame for the money till we were in bed, they were sent off till next\r\nmorning, when they came very early and asked for paper to write the\r\ncontract. My husband produced some, with pen and ink. They said they\r\ncould only write with a pencil, but when that was got the captain said\r\n500 must be paid: he did not want it himself, nor yet the sultan, but the\r\nsailors did; my husband then said he would complain to the Wali of Aden,\r\nand they all suddenly departed, and the captain, we heard, went to\r\nKadhoup, where there was another boat, in order to prevent its owner\r\nspoiling the sultan's bargain.\r\n\r\nTwo days after we had a message to say we were to pay the whole 800\r\nrupees at once, that the sultan was coming to fetch it himself, and that\r\nwe should positively start that day.\r\n\r\nNo sultan came, but next day a very affectionate letter from him said he\r\nwould come round with the ship at sunset. We had to forgive his\r\nnon-appearance that time, as there was such a storm that we could not, in\r\nany case, have passed the surf. Next day he came by land to the castle,\r\nwhere we had seen him, and sent to ask my husband to bring the money; so\r\nhe went, attended by myrmidons bearing money-bags, pen, and paper, but as\r\nthe sultan would not sign the contract, the money was brought back. At\r\nmidday there was an apology sent with two lambs and a little calf, and at\r\nsunset the sultan really arrived at our camp, signed the contract, and\r\ncarried off the money; so we left next day.\r\n\r\nWe had plenty to do, so were quite occupied all this time. I used to\r\ndevelop photographs, for I had my dark tent set up. I had awful trials to\r\nbear. The water was so warm that the gelatine frilled in spite of alum,\r\nand what was worse, when I put the negatives in the hyposulphate of soda\r\nthey ran off their supports like so much hot starch. Some I saved, but I\r\nnever dared do more than carefully dip them in the 'hypo,' and even then\r\nit seemed to froth up at once. I had a good many negatives marked by\r\nthis, and had to smooth off the bubbles with my hands, regardless of\r\ntheir colour, and I had to work at night for coolness.\r\n\r\nWe had very little milk while there; none till the last two days. A man\r\nwas drinking a bowlful in our camp, and this is the surprising way in\r\nwhich he did it: he dipped his hand in and sucked his fingers (not clean\r\nones at first), and so continued till he had finished it all up. Our\r\nvisitors used sometimes suddenly to hurry off to pray, choosing a bit of\r\ndamp sand, and when they returned some of the sand was sticking to their\r\nforeheads. The longer that sand stayed on the better, as it was\r\nconsidered a sign of a religious man.\r\n\r\nWe had an anxious battle with white ants also. A basket was nearly\r\ndevoured by them, but our best steamer raiment was preserved by the inner\r\nlining of American cloth, though they were sitting on it in sheets. We\r\nhad remarked in South Africa that they never eat mackintosh. The basket\r\nwas brushed over the sea, steeped in the lagoon, and inundated with\r\nboiling water. This was the only thing attacked of all that we had left\r\nbehind when we were in Hadibo the first time.\r\n\r\nOur brown ship, 70 feet in length by 15 wide, did really look a very\r\n'mere nutshell' to go 500 miles over the great ocean in, but it was far,\r\nfar better than some we had been in.\r\n\r\nFrom the deck Sokotra looked almost too beautiful to leave.\r\n\r\nThe weather was very rough, the sailors not nearly ready, and it was\r\nmidday before we started. By this time all the servants were prostrate,\r\nand my husband had to get the sailors to help him in setting up our beds,\r\nand arranging the baggage in the place between decks astern, which was 3½\r\nfeet high, and, as the beds had to be tied to each other, 2 feet apart,\r\nas well as to the sides of the ship, we had to bend low and step high\r\nwhen moving about. The two Somali servants managed wonderfully to take it\r\nin turns to be well after a bit, but Matthaios was one of the worst, so\r\nfood was a difficulty and his wrath was great when, Mahmoud having made\r\nus tea like ink, he found the tea canister empty. We had rough weather\r\nenough, but the wind was favourable. We were always afraid of falling off\r\nour seats at meals, for we were perched anywhere, on anything we could\r\nget, round our kitchen box as a table. Bruises alone were not the cause\r\nof our terror, but the fact is that the sailors were always shaking their\r\nraiment and making those searching and successful investigations,\r\naccompanied by that unmistakable movement of the elbows and backs of the\r\nthumb-nails, which literally 'give one the creeps.'\r\n\r\nThe captain had a compass, but no other instrument of any kind, and none\r\nof the sailors seemed to know the way. They showed us islands, which we\r\nknew to be such, as the African coast, and Cape Guardafui where we knew\r\nit could not be.\r\n\r\nOn the third evening we saw the Asiatic coast, and at sunset we saw the\r\njagged Jebel Shemshan very far away, and of course hoped to see it nearer\r\nnext day. But when we woke in the morning, my husband went out to see the\r\ncause of the unusual rocking of the ship and still more unusual silence,\r\nand found everyone asleep and the ship lying to out of sight of any land.\r\n\r\nThe captain said they imagined we had passed Aden in the dark, and\r\nthinking they should soon be among rocks or coral-reefs had stopped; a\r\ndreadful uproar then arose, and everyone on the ship shouted different\r\ndirections for steering. My husband desired them to steer north that we\r\nmight find land, as none of them had any idea of our longitude. At last\r\nwe saw a steamer, presumably from Aden, and getting north of her and\r\nsteering west we at length had Africa on our port side again, and reached\r\nAden by the following sunrise, though it took us till two o'clock to get\r\ninto port.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBELED FADHLI AND BELED YAFEI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCES WITH THE YAFEI SULTAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1897, soon after our return thither from Sokotra, we\r\nleft Aden to explore the Yafei and Fadhli countries. Our preparations for\r\nthis expedition were made under quite different and much happier\r\ncircumstances from those which attended our last journey from Aden to the\r\ninterior of Arabia, _i.e._ the Hadhramout. We received every help that\r\ncould be given us by General Cuningham, Colonel Hayes-Sadler, Captain\r\nWadeson, and, indeed, everyone from whom we asked assistance was most\r\nkind. We took with us only our servant Matthaios, the Greek, Musaben, an\r\nelderly man from the Aden troup, as jemadar or manager of the soldiers\r\nand go-between generally; and three or four soldiers. No interpreter was\r\nnecessary, I am glad to say, this time.\r\n\r\nWe left Sheikh Othman on February 28, 1897, for our nine hours' ride to\r\nBir Mighar, sorry to have to make so long a journey the first day. At\r\nfirst we went past pretty gardens and villas, but soon left these traces\r\nof civilisation behind us, and the way went through desert, sometimes\r\nsalty, sometimes sandy, sometimes bare, and sometimes with low bushes,\r\nnow straight, and at others wending among sand-hills with cliffs to\r\nleeward, and ribbed and rippled like water. In some parts every trace of\r\npath is smothered by sand, and quicksand also must be warily avoided. We\r\npassed the ruins of an old town near Sheikh Othman, and five miles on,\r\nImad, a wretched-looking collection of brushwood huts around a dar, or\r\ntower, still in English land.\r\n\r\nThis place is, about Christmas time, the scene of a fair to which all the\r\nneighbouring tribes gather, so a good study can be made of the native\r\ntongues.\r\n\r\nA few patches of ground had the sand scraped off into banks, and were\r\nawaiting rain to sow some crops for fodder, but looked as if they had\r\nbeen waiting a long time. This caravan road across the Abyan is very old;\r\nits monotony is inexpressible, for the nine hours to Bir Mighar. At the\r\nsixth hour the road to Hawash goes off to the left. As we approached the\r\nwell of Mighar the signs of population increased, and a few scrubby\r\nacacias grow near. There are two wells a mile apart; the farther, where\r\nwe encamped, was once protected by a fort, now in ruins. A few years ago\r\na hundred Yafei surprised the Fadhli, and sacked the fort, which has not\r\nsince been repaired. Many parties of travellers were gathering round this\r\nwell for the night; one husband and wife who took alternate charge of a\r\nbaby slung in a straw cradle and a goat; another pair with their\r\nhousehold goods, baby, and many fowls on a camel, while they were each\r\nladen with more fowls.\r\n\r\nWe passed a cold night, and were very tired; our things, having been\r\npacked on board the baggalla in which we came from Sokotra, were not in\r\nmarching order. We only made a short journey of six miles next day past\r\nAl Khabt, which was just the same sort of place as Imad. We had to take a\r\nmost circuitous route to reach it, and it was hard to realise that all\r\nthe banks we wound amongst were fields waiting for rain. Hagheri Ask, our\r\nnext halt, was even a yet more wretched hamlet--about six reed huts, and\r\nabout as many goats and jackal-like dogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE\r\n\r\nFADHLI COUNTRY\r\n\r\nSOUTH ARABIA.\r\n\r\nFrom a sketch survey by\r\n\r\nM^r. J. THEODORE BENT.\r\n\r\n1897.\r\n\r\n_Stanford's Geog.^l Estab.^t, London_\r\n\r\nLondon: Smith, Elder & Co.]\r\n\r\nOur tents were most unsteadily pitched on sand. There is a good well, and\r\nthere has been a village here 'from the first,' as the Arabs say. There\r\nare many traces of antiquity; and numerous pieces of glass, good pottery,\r\nand bangles lie about. There are three ruined tombs and some smaller ones\r\nof mud bricks, and they make mud bricks there still. The villages of the\r\nAbyan are most poverty-stricken places.\r\n\r\nThe first day we had our camels loaded with jowari, and at Bir Mighar we\r\ntook up fuel. From Hagheri Ask to Kanfar is about six miles, and we spent\r\ntwo hours over it. Trees became more numerous, good large ones, chiefly\r\narrack and acacia, and a few small fan-palms. There were quantities of\r\nbirds' nests, in every way a contrast to ours; for, instead of warm\r\nwoolly ones, safe from wind and rain in the innermost recesses of our\r\nsoft-leaved, easily climbed trees, these were loose open-work airy little\r\nbaskets, dancing on the outer tips of the thorny branches. The scenery in\r\nthe desert part was much improved by mirages of beautiful blue lakes and\r\nstreams, nearly under our feet. Once, on the journey, we thought the\r\npiping times of peace had come to an abrupt end. The army of three became\r\na vanguard, one who was riding having very suddenly turned himself into\r\ninfantry, the guns were taken out of their calico bags and cocked, but\r\nthe supposed enemy turned out to be only six or eight men carrying great\r\nrolls of skins and huge dry gourds for sale, so the rifles were packed up\r\nagain. Some had Martini-Henrys and one or two of the camel-men had\r\nmatchlocks.\r\n\r\nSince leaving the British Empire we had been in the Fadhli country till\r\nwe reached the Wadi Banna, or Benna, the boundary between the Beled\r\nFadhli and Beled Yafei, then winding indeed was our way, for we were in\r\nthick wood; swords and daggers had to be used to cut a path, and we were\r\nbrought to a standstill more than once, with our heads bent under\r\ntrees, not daring to lift them. It would be easy for the inhabitants to\r\nstop an enemy's attack here. The smell of the arrack is not at all\r\npleasant. Two Fadhli were once directed into the Banna bed by the Yafei\r\nof Al Husn, and when they were in the wood they set fire to it and burnt\r\nthem. The inhabitants do not venture off the path. There are quicksands\r\nin some parts of the wadi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTLE AT KANFAR]\r\n\r\nWe encamped not far from the town of Kanfar, amongst some large arrack\r\nbushes on the sand, and surrounded by mounds scattered over with bits of\r\nglass. There has been a succession of towns here, and the present one is\r\nsituated on large mounds near some somewhat ruinous forts. It would take\r\nan immense quantity of digging to come on Himyaritic remains. Many gold\r\ncoins are found, and set on the jembias; our old Musàben had two on his\r\ndagger, about four hundred years old. We were told that Boubakr-bin-Saïd,\r\nsultan of the lower Yafei, was to come in two days to keep the feast of a\r\nsaint, Wali Abdullah-bin-Amr, who is buried here. In the meantime we\r\nsurveyed our surroundings while awaiting his coming. The ground under the\r\narrack bushes is perforated through and through by rats with bushy tips\r\nto their tails, as far as the utmost branch extends. Sometimes we felt\r\nour feet sinking, and discovered we were walking over the site of a\r\nvanished bush. There is an old ruined castle, with pretty herring-bone\r\npatterns and open-work windows. The principal well, a little distance\r\nfrom the town, is very close by the present fortress, where the sultan\r\nlives. There is a gunpowder factory of a primitive kind, for there is\r\nplenty of saltpetre to be found close by. We went all about the village\r\nquite comfortably with a couple of Yafei guards, and the people were\r\ncivil. We saw curious ovens, like pots with lids, and oxen returning with\r\nthe dustpans they use for scraping the sand off the cultivable soil, and\r\nmany preparations for the feast in the way of food and very smart new\r\nindigo-dyed clothes. Photography, sketching, and unpacking the gifts for\r\nthe sultan occupied our time. The mosquitoes were awful.\r\n\r\nThe sultan came to visit us very suddenly on the afternoon of his\r\narrival--a rather handsome, sly-looking man. He wore a purple velvet\r\njacket embroidered with gold, and a many coloured turban and waist-cloth\r\nforming a petticoat to his knees and leaving his fat legs bare. His\r\ncomplexion is of a greenish brown. His first question was as to my\r\nhusband's age, that of the Wali of Aden, and of various other officials.\r\nHe brought some honey and made himself most agreeable till we spoke of\r\ngoing to Al Kara. He then immediately began to speak of danger. He read\r\nthe letter of introduction with more discretion than I have observed in\r\nany of the Arab sultans I have seen. Instead of reading to a crowd of\r\nslaves, he banished all but one very confidential, though dirty man, who\r\nwas lame and carried a long lance adorned with silver bands, and read\r\nthis letter and one previously sent. When he left, my husband told him\r\nthe sooner he sent a message as to the possibilities of going to Al Kara\r\nthe better it would be for him; and we also told Musàben to tell the\r\nBedouin there would be money for them, and also to mention to the sultan\r\nthat we had a gun that he might hope for.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, after much fruitless negotiation, that the sultan was\r\ndetermined to cheat the Bedouin. He arrived very soon after breakfast,\r\n_i.e._ before seven, and demanded 500 rupees for himself, which he\r\nimmediately lowered of his own accord to 400 rupees, and gave us to\r\nunderstand danger would be averted if we paid this sum. He carried off\r\n100 rupees for coffee and a bundle of turbans and other garments. No one\r\nbut Musàben was to know of the money, and the fat parcel he himself\r\nstuffed into the clothes of his dirty confidant, explaining to us and\r\nthem that he should only show an aluminium box as his sole gift, and\r\nwalked off holding it ostentatiously between his finger and thumb. Later\r\nwe walked round the castle, and were let into the courtyard. The sultan\r\nsaw us from a window in his tower, and beckoned us up. We had to go\r\nthrough gateways on all sides of the tower, so that they can quite\r\ncommand the entrance. We went up a high winding stair to a room about 10\r\nfeet square, where we sat on the floor and had coffee with cloves and no\r\nsugar, and a coarse kind of sweetmeat. His first question was, 'Where is\r\nthe gun?' I said, 'Where is Al Kara?' So he laughed merrily, and said,\r\n'You shall not go to Al Kara till I have the gun.' So I told him he\r\nshould not have the gun till we had been. He then told my husband he must\r\npay 1,000 rupees and the gun first, and he would manage the Bedouin; but\r\nmy husband said he would pay afterwards, and not more than 400 rupees. So\r\nthis conversation went on, and we left. Musàben was surprised that we had\r\nbeen admitted.\r\n\r\nWe spent our days taking long walks in the cultivated fields, stepping on\r\nbanks between the canals, or _abrs_. There were many trees, and acres of\r\ndukhan grown for making oil, gilgil, and other crops; and the shade, the\r\nbirds, the greenery, and water made it a pleasant relief from the sandy\r\nmounds. The workpeople are slaves of the subordinate race of Hagheri.\r\nThere are really very few Arabs. Watchmen or scarecrows, with long canes,\r\nstand on high platforms scattered about. The old well has very-much-worn\r\nstones round its mouth, and had once an extensive building over it. Corn\r\nis ground in a mill made from the hollowed trunk of a tree, with a camel\r\ngoing round and round. It was amusing to see the little children with\r\ntheir arms held aloft bound up in leaves to their elbows, to keep their\r\nhands nice, as they had been dyed with henna for the festival.\r\n\r\nJebel Gabeil is the acropolis of the ancient Kanfar, about 200 feet high\r\nand a quarter of a mile long, with a double fort on the top, containing\r\nan area of about 100 square yards. The outer wall is built of fine large\r\nstones, and the interior has a beautiful foundation, evidently\r\nHimyaritic, and commands an extensive view. The tomb of the saint whose\r\nfeast it was is surrounded with tombs, all in disrepair, but covered with\r\nvery pretty carved wood. The procession passed our camp both going and\r\ncoming, and was an interesting sight. Quite early I was begged to come\r\nout and see crowds of women and girls, who had come to visit me with\r\ntheir new clothes, some indigo-dyed and some of red ingrain. They wear\r\nthe same shape as in the Hadhramout, but do not cover their faces. They\r\nhave a good deal of jewellery, and paint their faces yellow. I did not\r\nsee any of the fantastic patterns I saw in the Hadhramout on the faces.\r\nFirst came four men with lances, dancing to and fro, then the sultan on a\r\ncamel, dressed in red and purple and gold, and after him about thirty\r\nsoldiers. A large white and red flag followed. On his return the sultan\r\nstopped and delivered a short address, the bystanders assenting by\r\nshouting 'Nahm! Nahm!'\r\n\r\nThe sultan came constantly, always raising his demands.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon he came and said 'Where is the gun?'\r\n\r\n'Under that bed; you cannot have it now.'\r\n\r\n'I should like to see the cartridges,' said the sultan.\r\n\r\n'They are packed up.'\r\n\r\nMy husband then did what might seem rude here but is all the fashion\r\nthere: he walked out of the tent and went off a little distance with\r\nMatthaios and Musàben to have a consultation; and the sultan got up and\r\nstood craning his neck and trying to listen, but I chattered and babbled\r\nto him to prevent his doing so, and finding he could hear nothing he said\r\nin a very cajoling sort of tone:\r\n\r\n'Al Kara is such a very nice place! you would like to see it,' and asked\r\nme just to let him see the gun and some more clothes, and when my husband\r\nreturned begged for more money; but he put on an air of great indignation\r\nand impatience and said:\r\n\r\n'When we say a thing once it is enough,' and when the sultan began again\r\nhe said 'Bas!' (Enough!) so loud that his majesty hastily departed.\r\n\r\nFinally, when he could not get what he wanted, and we saw it was not safe\r\nto trust ourselves in the hands of so shifty a man, he became so\r\ninsistent that my husband told him 'he had seen enough of him; he might\r\nleave our camp; we would not travel with him.' Off went the sultan in\r\nsuch a hurry that he left his stick behind, and sent us a message that we\r\nwere not to pass another night in his country. We sent back a message\r\nthat we would not stir till morning. When the sultan was gone we had tea,\r\nand I was talking to a dirty little boy of five called Boubakr and a\r\nbigger one called Ali, to whom I was giving lumps of sugar dirtied by the\r\njourney. We were laughing well at the sultan, calling him all sorts of\r\nnames expressing our scorn of his meanness, when to our amusement we\r\nfound these were his sons. He came himself about dawn next day to say we\r\nwere to go back over the Wadi Banna, and not the shortest way to the part\r\nof the Fadhli country, which is beyond the Yafei, unless we gave him more\r\nmoney. We would not speak to him ourselves, so he had to talk with the\r\nservants (who were continuing packing) all the while, and, we let him see\r\nthe greatest amusement on our part. Musàben was most anxious to go on,\r\nbut the difficulties delighted Matthaios, as he was so frightened that he\r\nwished to go back at any price. When we did go, about six o'clock, we\r\nonly went a very little way in the prescribed direction, then turned\r\nround, and took the path we desired, our army now being a rearguard,\r\nrushing up hillocks to watch for pursuers. We reached Al Khaur, a\r\nvillage with many ruined castles, and camped in frightful dust. The Wazir\r\nAbdullah bin Abdurrahman had been sent by the Fadhli sultan to welcome\r\nus. He proved a very agreeable travelling companion. He is young and\r\nrefined looking.\r\n\r\nWe saw a great deal of cattle about. There is a sheer rock overhanging\r\nthe village 1,000 feet above the plain. My husband ascended Jebel Sarrar\r\nto see the ruins. A fine paved road, protected by forts, climbs up past a\r\ncurious square stone said to be full of money, and goes zigzag through a\r\nnarrow gully like the walls at Zimbabwe. My husband having heard of the\r\nstone from the wazir, very much astonished the guides by pointing it out\r\nto them and saying 'There is money in that stone.' At the top there is a\r\nvery strong fortress with many walls, and three cisterns just like the\r\nsmaller of the tanks at Aden, with steps down into them, all covered with\r\ncement. This has been a very strong fortification, protecting and\r\noverlooking the whole of the Abyan from Jebel Goddam beyond Shukra to\r\nJebel Shemshan at Aden. The Abyan is the low plain by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe following day we started for Dirgheg. The country is all irrigated by\r\nwater brought from Masana by a channel called Nazai. At the corner of the\r\nWadi Hassan the _abrs_ branch off in every direction. The sources belong\r\nto the Yafei, and the Fadhli pay them annually 25 Maria Theresa dollars,\r\na basket of dates, and a turban for the sultan, but the management is in\r\nthe hands of seyyids in _inam_ for ever, they being supposed to be\r\nneutral, for fear a war might produce a drought. Still, in time of war\r\nthe water often is cut off. The banks of the abrs were full of castor-oil\r\nbushes, cotton, myrtle and tamarisk, all smothered with a pretty creeper\r\ncovered with yellow flowers and little scarlet gourds.\r\n\r\nDirgheg lies just on the left bank of the Wadi Hassan in an almost desert\r\nplace. There are many dars, or towers, where the wealthy Arabs, of whom\r\nthere is a considerable population, live. The servile tribe of Hagheri\r\nlive in reed huts; we saw them threshing gilgil and vetch. There are a\r\nmarket and a few shops. I had no trouble about taking photographs. Once,\r\nhowever, one of our attendants asked a man to move out of my way and gave\r\nhim a little push. Out he pulled his ghembia, and there was a scrimmage\r\nvery dangerous to my camera and its appurtenances, as they were going to\r\nbe used as weapons of defence by our attendants. I rushed into the midst,\r\nand they stopped fighting to tell me not to be afraid, and peace was\r\nrestored. I think it requires some courage to plunge out of the tent into\r\nthe burning sand with the camera, but it never seems so hot once one is\r\nout. We were given over by our soldiers to the charge of two inhabitants\r\nof Dirgheg, and were quite elated at hearing on other authority than our\r\nown, 'They can speak Arabic.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIRGHEG]\r\n\r\nWe had on our return to the camp the delightful pleasure of a letter from\r\nSultan Boubakr, making another try for the gun, and saying he would come\r\nand take us to Al Husn. The messenger was fetched, and scornfully told by\r\nmy husband that it was too late; we would not think of travelling with so\r\nbad a man. I said, 'You have a great thief for your sultan, and a great\r\nliar,' and told him all about the money and clothes he had secretly\r\ntaken; so, no doubt, he had to disgorge some after all. Musàben laughed\r\nvery much, and said my imitation of the sultan's manner was so good he\r\nmust get two sheikhs to hear the Bibi mimic the Yafei sultan. The Yafei\r\nmessenger was much interested. I told the whole story, and how we had\r\ngone round three trees and departed our own way, adding, 'The sultan\r\ncould see us from his own castle'; and he said, 'Yes, he did.' We told\r\nhim all his conduct was written down and sent yesterday to the Wali of\r\nAden, so now he might be sorry and frightened. We said we had been\r\ntreated well by all the other Yafei we had met, but the sultan wanted\r\nto cheat both them and us. Indeed, it grieved us to hear the kind Yafei\r\nspoken of with horror and detestation by the Fadhli, but no doubt they\r\nhave a different point of view to ours.\r\n\r\nWe went to another village called Abr Shebba, more under the mountains.\r\nWe were shown about very civilly, and taken to the door of a large dar,\r\nand asked if we wished to go in. We did not know if we were wanted, so\r\nmade an indefinite answer. There was a difference of opinion, and at last\r\nthey said the Bibi should go in; so I crossed the court and entered the\r\nhouse, and had hardly done so when my hand was seized, and I was dragged\r\nby a man through black darkness upward and round and round. I stepped\r\nhigh, and, as quickly as I could, rushed after him. At the third round I\r\nsaw a little light shining on the roughest possible shallow earthen\r\nsteps, and was pulled into a little room, where I was greeted with cries\r\nof amazement by some women, and then continued my way unaided to the top\r\nof the tower. The parapets were ornamented with gazelle horns. After some\r\ntime I wanted to go down, but I was on my way taken to a large room where\r\nmanners demanded I should settle down for coffee. Every one was very\r\nkind, and for greater friendliness a naked baby four months old was\r\nplaced in my hands. When I wished to return it it was made to sit on my\r\nknee. It soon kindly cried, and was, to my joy, removed. It had never in\r\nits life been completely washed, though several large spots and trimmings\r\nhad been painted on its head. My husband joined me at last, and had\r\ncoffee too.\r\n\r\nThe first thing next morning, before our departure to Al Ma'a, another\r\nletter came from the Yafei sultan about Al Husn; but the messenger was\r\ntold that once was enough to see that great thief (_harami_), and he\r\ncould take the letter back. It was fourteen miles to Al Ma'a, and took us\r\nsix hours. We passed up the Wadi Hassan, and saw Al Husn in the\r\ndistance. We did not go quite to the corner where the Wadi Hassan turns\r\neast. It is considered too near the Yafei frontier to be safe, and the\r\nFadhli always used a narrow pass called Tarik al Kaha, going round Mount\r\nGherash. It gets narrower and steeper as it goes on zigzagging up slabs\r\nof shale, with only room for one camel at a time. There are any amount of\r\nambush places, especially on the north side. The pass goes uphill, west\r\nto east, and the steepest end is at the east. A spur runs out west on the\r\nnorth side about 50 feet high, convenient to shoot over. The approaches\r\nare quite open. It leads through Wadi Goddam to Wadi Hassan, and at the\r\nentrance to Wadi Hassan, Fadhli Bedouin are for ever stationed to watch\r\nfor Yafei attacks on a tiny jutting hill. Three men of ours, sheikhs who\r\nhad come to meet us, galloped forward to explain to them who we were, and\r\nascertain that all was safe. They fired a gun over our heads. There were\r\na few baboons about. We saw several little heaps of stones, and were told\r\nthey marked spots where Fadhli had been shot by Yafei. A very large heap\r\nis formed by those who pass the valley safely for good luck. We also\r\npassed the tomb of a seyyid with four large smooth stones at the top\r\nanointed with oil for the Ed. Before we reached Al Ma'a the river-bed\r\nnarrowed in from the other side, and along the raised bank at short\r\nintervals were watch-towers of the Yafei. At Al Ma'a they are quite\r\nclose, about half a mile off at most. The country was still very arid and\r\nbarren, but the mountains very fine.\r\n\r\nAl Ma'a is a wretched hamlet, which has seen very much better days. There\r\nare high ruined castles, destroyed by the present sultan, as Al Ma'a and\r\nits head-men were once in revolt. Now there are only three or four Arab\r\nhouses and a collection of reed huts. The valley is about two miles wide,\r\nand there are four or five Yafei towers near. Our escort were very much\r\nafraid. They said that the Yafei might shoot us, though a cannon would\r\nbe necessary, and lay the blame on the Fadhli, so they would by no means\r\nlet us camp anywhere but in a most disgustingly dusty place next the\r\nvillage; and they kept sharp watch all night, talking much. The towers\r\nprotect the approach to the Wadi Theba, which here goes up or comes down\r\nfrom Al Kara. The country round is in a perpetual state of ferment, like\r\nGermany in the Middle Ages, every one on the look-out for attacks from\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nAMONG THE FADHLI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were up and off before the sun rose, our party being increased by\r\nSultan Salem, brother to the Fadhli sultan. He was twenty, and though not\r\ndark in colour, has woolly hair. He and the soldiers and the wazir,\r\nAbdullah bin Abdurrahman, rode at some distance to our left, between us\r\nand the dangerous Yafei towers. The Goddam or Kadam range, which\r\nseparates the Wadi Yeramis from the Abyan, is a mass of arid peaks, none\r\nreaching to more than 2,000 feet. A road leads from Al Ma'a across the\r\nmountains to the sea at Asala.\r\n\r\nWe reached Karyat el Maksuf about ten, the valleys getting narrower and\r\nmore woody and grassy as we approached. There is an ancient fort on a\r\nhill 650 feet above the valley, and about 1,300 above the sea, with a\r\nglorious view over the Goddam range to the sea. There is another ruin of\r\na round fort on the left of the valley. We went on a mile to a delightful\r\nplace, where there were trees, water, and reeds, and beautiful views\r\nthrough shady glades to the mountain peaks, and many cattle. We wished to\r\nremain there, but were told it was better to get on to Naab, as there was\r\na little danger. We quite understood that danger was a bogey to prevent\r\nus keeping them from a town, and we pointed out that the Yafei were not\r\nlikely to come down a light-coloured mountainside with only a few\r\ntamarisks into a valley half a mile wide; so my husband firmly said we\r\nwould stay on the clean sand. Here we saw many baboons. The first ruin is\r\nprobably Persian or later Arabian. The second one, which is a mile\r\nfurther up the Wadi Yeramis than the first, is evidently Himyaritic, and\r\nprotected the first town after Banna on the way to the Hadhramout. It is\r\ncircular, crowning a hill 300 feet high, and enclosing a space of 50\r\nyards in diameter. On the north-east side it is protected by five square\r\ntowers, and has one gate to the south. It was the acropolis of a large\r\ntown, lying in all directions, but chiefly to the north-east. It has\r\nevidently been a place of considerable strength, as the Wadi Yeramis is\r\nonly half a mile wide here. There is a regular stream of water in a\r\nnarrow channel, and the whole valley is green and fertile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD NA'AB\r\n\r\n(_By Theodore Bent_)]\r\n\r\nBefore we entered this narrow part of the valley, it was curious to see\r\nbelow the peaked mountains a flat-topped effusion of basalt, called\r\n_borum_, advanced forward.\r\n\r\nWe made a very early start next morning, and gradually got into a thick\r\nlow wood, but where the Wadi Yeramis widened out there were only\r\ntamarisks. Our ascent was rapid, and after about an hour we turned due\r\neast, this part being very bare-looking, though there were a good many\r\nhorrid acacias and also euphorbias with rounded trunks. We soon burst\r\nupon a lovely plain all mapped out in fields and abrs. It is six miles to\r\nNaab, and we took three hours. We passed through full two miles of this\r\nfertility, with three or four villages--Souat, Nogat, Arrawa, and Old\r\nNaab, with mosque, minar, and a fine old house all tumbling into ruins.\r\nWadi Yeramis is much opened out here, and the lower part is bounded by\r\nthe basalt in walls about 200 feet high, sometimes with mounds within\r\nthem again, and hillocks of the same formation as the high mountains.\r\nThis cultivated paradise is the property of Sultan Ahmet bin Salem,\r\nbrother to Sultan Saleh of the coast, and may be said to be the pick of\r\nhis whole dominions.\r\n\r\nArrawa, or New Naab, has twenty-four shops, and the sultan gets half a\r\nreal (or Maria Theresa dollar) on all merchandise-camels going up to the\r\nBeled Yafei. There were many bales of merchandise in a sort of\r\nCustom-house when we arrived at this great centre of inland traffic. We\r\nencamped on the opposite side of the wadi from the town of Arrawa, which\r\nis perched on a raised plateau of earth banks. When we halted, and had\r\nclimbed up, there was a line of people waiting to salute us. We and\r\nSultan Salem walked in front, our eleven men with guns walked behind,\r\nsinging a _merghazi_, or salutation song, of which I have a copy. We\r\nhalted again, and they fired ten salutes; then we advanced again, Sultan\r\nSalem leading, when twenty of the local sultan's soldiers came forward\r\nand kissed his hand and shook ours. Then there was a refreshment of five\r\nor six cups of coffee and ginger, very weak, on the floor in a tower.\r\nThere was milk in the first cups, but it became exhausted. We never saw\r\nthe sultan all the time we were there, for they said he had a wound in\r\nhis leg.\r\n\r\nThe earthen cliffs are about 30 feet high, and we had to go a very\r\nroundabout way to get up them by very narrow gullies. My husband went up\r\na hill, Yerad, just behind Naab, with an old Arab fort on it above the\r\nYeramis, which ends here; then begins Wadi Reban, with a clear course\r\nnorth-east for three miles, then north, and then a long stretch east\r\nagain. There was a lovely view over the Yafei mountains on the north and\r\nGoddam range on the south. A Bedou, Abdallah, who went with him told him\r\nall the names. Though he could understand when the Bedouin talked to him,\r\nhe could not understand two talking together. Abdallah said he had been a\r\nsoldier in the sultan's service, but when my husband asked how long he\r\nanswered, 'Four, five, six years. I have never had it written down.' The\r\nBedou gave my husband some food called _kharou_, roast millet seeds put\r\nin a mug with boiled milk, not at all bad.\r\n\r\nThe Sultan Salem bin Saleh's old abandoned castle had some nice\r\ndecoration about it. They left it because there were so many jinni\r\n(_i.e._ ghosts) in it. Our informant had not seen them, but only heard of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMarch the 12th my husband went up what he thought was the highest\r\nmountain of the Goddam range, Minzoko, just behind Naab, and made it\r\n2,000 feet, but considered when he got to the top that its neighbour\r\nHaidenaab was 300 or 400 feet higher. The Tarik Minzoko goes between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe sultan sent to our camp some bowls of food, soup, and a fowl cut up\r\nand cooked in gravy, very rich with oil and onions. It would have been\r\ngood but for the stuffy, bitter taste of myrrh, which they like so much\r\nto put in their food. He also sent us red cakes of millet bread.\r\n\r\nA poet of Naab made a _merghazi_ on us during our stay, about our\r\ntreatment by the Yafei sultan: how he had demanded money of us and how he\r\nhad bidden us return to Aden. This was thought so excellent by everybody\r\nthat my husband was forced to take a copy of it from dictation and Sultan\r\nSalem took a copy back to Shukra.\r\n\r\nOur party was now increased by another 'prince,' Sultan Haidar, son of\r\nthe sultan of Naab, a person delightful to contemplate. He was got up in\r\nBedou style; his hair, fluffy and long, was tied back by a fillet and\r\nstuck out in a bush behind. He had a curious countenance and very weak\r\neyes. He was wrapped in a couple of large blue cotton cloths with very\r\nlong fringes, half a yard at least. The cotton is plastered with indigo,\r\neven beyond the dye, and when calendered, as the clothes are when new,\r\ngleam purple and red. The richer you are the bluer you are, and Sultan\r\nHaidar was very blue indeed. The curious thing about these blue people is\r\nthat, as the prominent parts of the face and body are the darkest, there\r\nis an odd inside-out effect.\r\n\r\nWhile in Naab we had our usual number of patients, but the one we were\r\nmost interested in was a woman who had a dreadfully sore foot. The foot\r\nwas very much swollen, and there was a sore on her instep and ankle in\r\nwhich one could nearly put one's fist. This had never been washed, though\r\nit had been going on for some years, and it had a dressing composed of\r\nhalf a pound or so of dates stuffed into it. The poor creature lay on a\r\nsort of bedstead or _charpai_ in a tidy little house consisting of one\r\nroom and lighted only by the door.\r\n\r\nMy husband set off at once half a mile back to camp to fetch the\r\nnecessary relief and I waited, sitting on a cloak that someone rolled up\r\non the floor, for there was not even a carpet to sit on. I was afraid of\r\nvarious insects, but I could not rudely stand, and I should have had to\r\nstand a good time as my husband had a mile to walk.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned he syringed the sore with Condy's fluid and I cleaned it\r\nwith bits of wadding, and the woman with her nails in a way that made me\r\nshudder, but she did not seem to hurt herself. Then we put on zinc\r\nointment. She drew her bedding from under her foot so that the water\r\nstreamed through the bed to the floor, which was earthen and below the\r\nlevel of the door. There was a big puddle, of course, and I feared they\r\nwould have mud to contend with, but a woman soon came with a basketful of\r\ndry sand, and by constantly brushing it up when wet into a palm-leaf\r\ndustpan quickly cleaned up all the mess.\r\n\r\nWe went daily to attend to this foot and at last, if not much better, it\r\nwas improved by becoming thoroughly clean, foot, leg and all, and its\r\npoor owner was cheered and looked much brighter herself.\r\n\r\nWe left her all the zinc ointment we had remaining to use first; a\r\nmilk-tinful of ointment, composed by me from pure lanoline, vaseline, and\r\nzinc powder, to go on with, and some grease-proof paper to spread it on,\r\na lot of tabloids of permanganate of potash and directions to pour it\r\nfrom a water vessel, very clean.\r\n\r\nBefore the family would undertake to receive these final instructions we\r\nhad to wait while some elderly persons were fetched, reputed wiseacres\r\nevidently, and it was like teaching a class. The poor things, with such\r\nearnest faces, were determined to make very sure they all thoroughly\r\nunderstood what to do. An old man took each thing and handed it to the\r\nhusband, telling him how to use it, and we all consulted as to the best\r\nniches in the roof in which to stow the things safely. They, at least,\r\nlonged for us to stay, and we felt sorry to go. One feels so helpless\r\nface to face with such misery. I do hope she got well.\r\n\r\nThe first day we visited this house a great crowd came after us, but they\r\nwere turned out with sticks and fastened out in a very ingenious way.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses are surrounded by a fence of prickly brushwood, in\r\nwhich is an entrance 3 or 4 feet wide. Outside this stands, on its head,\r\nwith its root in the air, a bush. The root has a rope of twisted\r\npalm-leaf attached to it. You enter and pull the rope. The bush stands on\r\nits side then and blocks up the entrance; the rope is secured inside to a\r\nbar which is fixed across the threshold and no one can pass this strange\r\nand thorny gate. The bush is, of course, wider than the gateway.\r\n\r\nCertainly Arabians are not all that one expect. I never can believe that\r\nMohammedans in general can consider dogs so very unclean, when they have\r\nso many about them, and one tribe in the Soudan is called Kilab (dogs).\r\nWe used to hear also that they all shaved their heads, leaving one lock\r\nonly for Mohammed to draw them up into Heaven. Instead of this they do\r\nall kinds of things to their hair, and the only people I ever saw with\r\none lock were the Yourouks in Asia Minor, and I think it was only a\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nSome people think that all the rude efforts of aborigines and\r\nuncultivated tribes are inspired by truer wisdom than are the results of\r\nscience and civilisation, and amongst other things, turbans are pointed\r\nout to us as an instance of the good sense of people in hot climates, who\r\nknow how necessary it is to protect their heads from the sun. If so, why\r\ndo some cover their heads with turbans and some not? and why do those who\r\nwear turbans take them off to cool their heads in the sun, and some\r\naccidentally leave a bit of head exposed when they put the turban on\r\nwithout ever finding it out? Some never cover the middle of the head at\r\nall, but only wind the turban round. My theory, which may be wrong, is\r\nthat it is really worn for ornament, as a diadem in the original sense of\r\nthe word, just tied round the head as a mark of dignity.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, our camp being on the far side of the valley from the\r\ntown, we managed to give the slip to the spearman who otherwise would\r\nhave accompanied us, and sneaked up a very narrow little wadi, where we\r\nfound a good many flowers and enjoyed this very much.\r\n\r\nWild beasts live in holes in these hills, and on the extreme top of the\r\nmountain my husband ascended, was found a big goat that had been killed\r\nin the wadi the night before. A little hairy animal called _ouabri_ was\r\nbrought to our camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FADHLI AT SHARIAH, WADI REBAN, WITH CURIOUS SANDAL]\r\n\r\nWhen we left Naab we turned into the Wadi Reban to Shariah--three hours\r\nand ten minutes, seven geographical miles, four north-east and three\r\nnorth--and ascended 350 feet. Wadi Reban is a quarter of a mile wide near\r\nNaab, but after two miles opens out; and there are gardens, and now and\r\nagain running water appears, and plenty of trees. At the fourth mile,\r\nnear a fort, we turned sharply to the north, past Jebel Riah, where Wadi\r\nRiah comes in, and then reached a wide open space, where Wadi Silib joins\r\nin. Jebel Shaas was beyond us, very high, and Wadi Ghiuda to the\r\nright. This large open space is girt with mountains 500 to 5,000 feet\r\nhigh, and is a great junction for the waters from Wadis Reban, Silib, and\r\nGhiuda. It was once exceedingly populous; there are here no less than\r\nfour old villages called Shariah; two considerable towns were perched on\r\nthe rocks, forming gates to the Wadi Silib, and two others at a great\r\nelevation on the opposite side. The cause of the decrease in population\r\nin Arabia must be the constant inter-tribal warfare and the gradual\r\nfilling up of the valleys with sand. Great banks of sand 20 feet high\r\nline the river-beds, and wash away with the heavy rains, which contribute\r\nto the silting up. This country must have been very fertile to have\r\nsupported the population, for the four towns must have been large. The\r\nstone buildings alone would make any one of the four larger than most\r\ntowns in Arabia to-day, and there must have been the usual hut\r\npopulation. We had a very pleasant camp among trees, and had a steep\r\nscramble to the ruins.\r\n\r\nAn enthusiastic geologist would have enjoyed our next day's journey\r\nimmensely; we went through such a strange weird volcanic valley--not a\r\nwadi, but a sheb, narrower and shallower. The road is called Tarik Sauda.\r\nThe strata of the rocks are heaved up at a very steep angle, and we had\r\nto ride along smooth rocks, sometimes without any trace of a road at all\r\namong the stones; sometimes we had to make very great windings amongst\r\nheaps and hillocks of all sorts of different-coloured earths. Hardly a\r\ngreen thing was to be seen, and altogether the whole place looked dreary\r\nand desolate; but we were much interested in this day's journey among the\r\ngreat scarred and seamed volcanic mountains. We ascended 650 feet--very\r\ndifficult indeed, travelling about seven miles in four hours; the\r\nsteepest part is called Akaba Sauda. We reached the headwater of the Wadi\r\nGhiuda at the top of the akaba, 2,000 feet from sea level. Naab is 1,000\r\nfeet above sea level; thence to Shariah is 350; and thence to Ghiuda,\r\n650. We passed Dogoter and M'Haider, mere names. We encamped on a waste\r\nof stones; no tent-pegs could be used, and it was windy and cold.\r\n\r\nThere are gazelle in this part and we had some for dinner.\r\n\r\nNow was our time to send by Musaben to the camp of the sultans three very\r\ngay blankets for them and Abdullah-bin-Abdurrahman. The long name of the\r\nwazir's father had constantly to be on our lips on account of his\r\ndignity, for they are like the Russians in that respect--common people's\r\nfathers are not mentioned. The name was marvellously shortened to\r\nB'd'rahman. We were thought to be in danger that night, and did not make\r\na very early start, as we had to load up water; and we two climbed down\r\n350 feet into the Wadi Ghiuda, that I might take photographs. It was so\r\npretty, with pools of water and creepers hanging on the trees.\r\n\r\nThe sultans, meanwhile, sat up in their beds of leaves wrapped in their\r\nblankets. How absurd it seems that two princes and a prime minister\r\nshould have to sleep out because two English choose to travel in their\r\ncountry! Not a word of thanks did we ever get for those blankets, but\r\nthey were evidently much appreciated, for their recipients sat on their\r\ncamels wrapped over head and ears in them in the blazing sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nFROM THE PLAIN OF MIS'HAL TO THE SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nWe joined the camels on the way, and after two hours of stones ascended\r\nthe very steep Akaba Beva. The view from the hills above--about 2,500\r\nfeet--is splendid, all the Yafei mountains and the Goddam range ending at\r\nHaide Naab, and giving place to the higher mountains of Rekab and Ghiuda.\r\nWe descended, but not much, into the lovely Wadi Hadda, full of trees\r\nsmothered with a kind of vine with thick glossy indiarubber-like leaves;\r\nthen we went on straight up Akaba Hadda to the huge plain of Mis'hal,\r\nfull of villages, but ill-supplied with water. There are only some very\r\nbad wells for the cattle, and they have to fetch drinking-water from\r\nafar, from Ghenab and Lammas. We engaged a Bedou's camel to keep us\r\nsupplied, while resting our own. The plain is 2,700 feet above the sea.\r\nThe sheikh's name is Mohommod-bin-Nasr Nakai; this is the first time we\r\nheard this pronunciation of the Prophet's name. He was determined to give\r\nus a grand reception. Sheikh Seil had gone forward to announce us from\r\nGhiuda, and he came to meet us on his pony down both akabas--a fearful\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLAGE OF MIS'HAL]\r\n\r\nWe always liked Sheikh Seil very much. He was the sheikh of Dirgheg. His\r\nhair and his shaggy chest were not white, but a lovely sky-blue. In that\r\npart of the world old people's hair is not dyed red with henna, as it is\r\nin other parts of Arabia and Asia Minor and in Persia, so the effect of\r\nthe indigo can be seen.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance we could see the preparations. There was a long line on\r\nthe sandy plain of between two and three hundred Bedouin, naked save for\r\na blue scarf round their waists, with dagger, powder-horn, &c., stuck in.\r\nSome had guns, matchlocks, and some had spears. They mostly had their\r\nlong hair tied up and sticking out in a fuz behind, as funny a long line\r\nof men as ever one saw.\r\n\r\nWe dismounted, nearly a quarter of a mile off, and all our party advanced\r\nhand-in-hand, fourteen besides ourselves and Matthaios, we being the only\r\nones who did not know the words in which to chant our response to the\r\nwelcoming shout. This they interrupted occasionally by the high gurgling\r\nsound they are so fond of, constantly coming out of the rank, one or\r\nother, and firing a gun and retiring. The blue-bearded Sheikh Seil\r\ngalloped up and down in front of us, twirling his spear. We stopped 150\r\nyards from them, and after much more firing the spearmen began to parade\r\nbefore us in a serpentine way, two and two, backwards and forwards,\r\nzigzag, and round and round the gunners, gradually getting nearer and\r\nnearer to us, and dragging the gunners after them, with a red flag, a\r\nseyyid, and their sheikh, Mohommod-bin-Nasr, between them. When they got\r\nquite close they welcomed us, and we said 'Peace' to them. They passed us\r\nso many times that we could see and notice them well. Some were very\r\ntall; one who was very lame led his tiny little boy. The lancers danced\r\nvery prettily, having a man a little way in front of them executing wild\r\ncapers and throwing up his spear and catching it, singing all the while\r\nsongs of welcome. We could not understand more than some allusions, which\r\nassured us they were composed for the occasion. After many gyrations they\r\nretired to their former place, and then a herald came forward and made a\r\nsolemn address of welcome.\r\n\r\nThen our turn came, and we sent forth a line of men with Sultan Haidar\r\nin it to sing and let off guns. When the two lines met they shook hands\r\nand kissed, the sultans and seyyids being kissed on the forehead and the\r\nupper part of the leg. When they returned to us all our party joined\r\nhands to go to our camp, now ready, a good distance off, all keeping step\r\nin a kind of stilted, prancing way, singing. The spearmen in front danced\r\nwith all manner of light and graceful antics, and we were nearly stifled\r\nwith the dust; and the din was so appalling that we arrived quite dazed\r\nat our tents after this welcome, which had lasted fully an hour. We were\r\nthe first white people who had been at Mis'hal. I tore my camera from its\r\ncase to take a photograph before the people left us, and it did better\r\nthan I could have expected in such a crowd, with no sun and so much\r\nwhirling dust. The town consists of a low square dar and a collection of\r\nbrushwood arbours, so slight that there is no pretension of concealing\r\nanything that goes on inside. We were very thankful for a large pot of\r\ncoffee and ginger, sent by a sultan, and a fat lamb. The princes ventured\r\nto leave us in charge of Abdullah-bin-Abdurrahman, and abode in the\r\ntower. Sultan Haidar went home from here.\r\n\r\nThe tableland of Mis'hal is approached by three akabas: (1) Sauda, to\r\n2,000 feet; (2) Beva, to 2,500 feet; (3) Hadda, to 2,750 feet. The Nakai\r\ntribe live here, and are on friendly terms with their neighbours the\r\nFadhli--a sufficiently rare circumstance in this country. The Nakai chief\r\ncan put four hundred men in the field to help the Fadhli. The Markashi\r\nwere at war with them; they live in the Goddam range, and had been giving\r\nthe sultan trouble lately.\r\n\r\nThe road to Shukra most frequented is the Tarik el Arkob; eastward goes\r\nthe road to the Hadhramout, over the plain. Northward is the mountainous\r\ncountry of the Aòdeli tribe, where they told us 'it is sometimes so cold\r\nthat the rain is hard and quite white, and the water like stone.' The\r\nplain is ten or fifteen miles long, by about four or five miles at its\r\nbroadest. If irrigated it would yield enormously. The well is of great\r\ndepth, but the water very bad. My husband ascended a mountain about 3,000\r\nfeet high, but only 400 feet above the plain, with a most remarkable view\r\nof the Aòdeli mountains, about twenty miles away, towering up to a great\r\nheight--far higher than the Yafei range, which Mr. Tate gives as 7,000\r\nfeet: these are probably 10,000 feet. The range must run for thirty or\r\nforty miles from east to west, with few breaks and no peaks. We were not\r\nwell the last day at Mis'hal.\r\n\r\nThe Aòdeli women paint red lines under their eyes and down their noses\r\nand round their foreheads with a kind of earth-dye which they call\r\n_hisn_. Sometimes there is a round spot on the forehead and red triangles\r\non the cheeks. One woman had her face literally dyed scarlet all over.\r\nShe had a heavy necklace of beads and carried the sheep-skin coat, that\r\nshe could not wear in the hot plain, rolled up and laid on her head. It\r\nis curious how dissatisfied dark people seem to be with the colour of\r\ntheir skins, so often trying to lighten it; the fairness of the English\r\nis in some places attributed to the soap they use.\r\n\r\nWe took advantage of the curiosity of the Aòdeli, who had just arrived\r\nwith a _kafila_, to make them stay in our camp and question them. The El\r\nKhaur mountains look most fascinating to see only from a distance: they\r\nare inhabited by lawless tribes owing allegiance to no man, and, having\r\nno wholesome fear of the Wali of Aden before their eyes, would murder any\r\ntraveller who ventured among them; they are all Bedouin. The Aòdeli are a\r\nvery large tribe, and say they have 4,000 men for war; the Markashi can\r\nput 500 or 600 in the field; and the Fadhli 2,000. Lauda, the chief town\r\nof the Aòdeli, is much bigger than Shibahm; there are many Arabs. The\r\nsultan is Mohamed-bin-Saleh. It is six hours from Mis'hal--thirty-four\r\nmiles--and is situated below the mountains. Above it is El Betha--Sultan\r\nSaleh. Belad el Megheba, in the upper Yafei country, is under Sultan\r\nHakam Mohamed-bin-Ali. Sabad el Baida Resass (where there must be lead)\r\nis not under the Turks; El Aòdeli live there. Neither is Sahib Lauda\r\nunder the Turks; the inhabitants are Augheri. This has a very soft\r\nguttural--the Arabic _ghin_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAIN OF MIS'HAL AND AÒDELI TRIBE]\r\n\r\nOur next stage was Bir Lammas, about four miles off, mostly across the\r\nmonotonous plain. We passed four dars and villages. In time of war the\r\nFadhli sultan comes and occupies one of these dars. We met sheikhs\r\nwalking with little battle-axes on long poles--weapons in war, and in\r\npeace used for chopping wood, at all times emblems of their rank. The\r\nplain at length broke away, and we got into the narrow, and not very\r\ndeep, wooded Wadi el Mimin. It has very precipitous sides of basalt,\r\nbrown in colour, and making a very untidy attempt at being columnar. Bir\r\nLammas is a great, and I must add, very dirty, halting-place for caravans\r\ngoing to Shukra, on the Tarik el Arkob, to El Kaur and the Wadi\r\nHadhramout.\r\n\r\nWe were two nights at Bir Lammas. I was too ill to go about at all, but I\r\ncould not resist going out to see some baboons which came to look at us\r\nfrom the low cliffs. I am sure their leader must have been 4 feet long\r\nwithout his tail.\r\n\r\nMy husband, who went for a climb, came to pretty close quarters with a\r\nstriped hyena.\r\n\r\nWe were encamped about 380 yards off from the well, and thought it a very\r\npretty place, with acacia-trees and creepers hanging in long trails and\r\nmaking arbours of all of them. The women do all the work here, having to\r\nfetch water from Bir Lammas and Ghenab for Mis'hal. The children, up to\r\nfourteen years of age, tend the flocks, and the men stroll about or sit\r\nin very warlike-looking conclaves, with guns and spears. Young children\r\nhave wooden jembias to accustom them to their use, and it is funny to see\r\ntiny urchins of three or four hurling reeds at each other in imitation of\r\ntheir elders with more deadly weapons. The Bedouin seem born in an\r\nelement of war; one we heard of had lasted fifteen years, but was happily\r\nnow stopped for a little while.\r\n\r\nOn a hill near the plain, about half a mile from Bir Lammas, there are\r\nruins of good style, probably of the Ashabir period of Hamdani.\r\n\r\nWe were to ride five hours to the next water after Bir Lammas. I felt it\r\nwould be an awful journey, as I was becoming more and more inert, but I\r\nwas able to jump on to my camel as usual. I begged my husband to tell me\r\nas each hour passed, being quite determined never to ask too soon, but\r\nevery time I did ask it turned out to be only twenty minutes from the\r\nlast time.\r\n\r\nWe were soon out of Wadi Lammas, and went over stony plains with basalt\r\nscattered over them, and no possible place to encamp, which I was keenly\r\non the look-out for. We went through a curious little pass, not high, but\r\na very narrow cutting just wide enough for us to ride through, for 300\r\nyards, and then we had to wind down steeply at the other side over rocks.\r\nI began to feel that I had no control over my legs and I hardly cared to\r\nchange my position for going up or down hill, and once when my camel\r\nslipped down about 5 feet, I started to fall off headlong, but a Bedou\r\ncaught me by my leg and held me on. If I had fallen, as the path was very\r\nnarrow, the camel would surely have stepped on me. I should certainly\r\nhave cracked my skull first. Camels are not like horses--they do not\r\nobject to stepping on people.\r\n\r\nA late sultan of Shukra fell from his camel and was trampled on, and\r\n'though the Koran was read to him, and _herris_ or talismans were put on\r\nhim, his breath would not stay in him, but came out in half an hour.'\r\n_Herrises_ are put on camels to make them strong; my husband's camel had\r\none, of which its master was very proud.\r\n\r\nAt last we came to the Wadi Samluf, and I begged that we might stop and\r\nhave a camel fetched for water. I had to be dragged from my camel, and\r\nlaid in the cinder-like sand till the tent was pitched, for, as my\r\nmalarial fever was constant, and I had no tertian intervals, I lost my\r\nstrength completely. Both my husband and I, and several others were very\r\nill, and we were not strong enough to get at our medicine chest. The\r\nwater was very bad. The Sultan Salem and other grandees camped at the\r\nmore dangerous open mouth of the valley.\r\n\r\nThe place where we pitched the tents was very pretty. There were trees\r\nand very fantastic peaky rocks against the sky, and a great step about 3\r\nfeet high, which had once been a wave of basalt, black on the yellow\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThe camel-men used to spread their beds and light their fire on this sort\r\nof stage by night, but they spent the day under the trees.\r\n\r\nThe last night we were in the Wadi Samluf there was a great noise--guns\r\nfiring, parties going out to reconnoitre, and shouting--but it turned out\r\nthat the new-comers who arrived at such an unseasonable hour were sent by\r\nthe sultan of Shukra to welcome and escort us.\r\n\r\nFrom this spot I had to be carried to the sea, seventeen miles, on my\r\nbed, which was strengthened with tent-pegs and slung on tent-poles. From\r\nthe little sultan downwards there was not one who did not help most\r\nkindly. We went down gently 3,000 feet. I cannot describe this journey,\r\nexcept that it was so very winding that I seemed to see the camels\r\nmeeting and passing me often. Fortunately the crossing of the low hot\r\nAbyan was short.\r\n\r\nI dreaded the journey, as I thought my bearers would not keep step, but\r\nthey did wonderfully well, though of course they had no path to walk in,\r\nfor two men and the bed were far too wide for any path there was. I saw\r\none man double up his legs and go over a boulder 3 feet or 4 feet high;\r\nand they kept me very even too, and only dropped my head once; the\r\nbearers changed as smoothly as if they were accustomed to it, and were\r\nalways saying something kind to me.\r\n\r\nI was not pleased at first at being carried off very suddenly head first,\r\nbut it was certainly sweeter not having all those men in front of me, and\r\nI rejoiced in a delicious sea-wind, which blew stronger and stronger, and\r\njust seemed to keep me alive. I was very grateful to them, and took good\r\ncare never to ask if we had still far to go.\r\n\r\nHow glad I was to find myself in a rushing, roaring, rabble rout of men,\r\nwomen, and children tearing along beside me!--not a thing I generally\r\nlike, but now it told me of the end of my weary journey. I was deposited\r\non my bed in a tower, tent-pegs and poles removed, and left with a\r\nspearman on the doorstep to keep off intruders. The rest of our miserable\r\nfever-stricken party came in half an hour later. The sultan of the Fadhli\r\ncame to our tent to see us--a pleasant-faced mustard-coloured man; and\r\nalso his wife, the daughter of an Aden sheikh, a very handsome woman.\r\nThey were very kind in sending milk, watermelons, and any little luxury\r\nthey could. The sultan lived in a fine brown building with a stunted\r\ntower, a glorified Arab house, but nothing like those in the Hadhramout.\r\nThey send sharks' fins to China from here, as well as from Sokotra and\r\nthe Somali coast. This is probably Ptolemy's Agmanisphe Kome. It is just\r\nthe right distance from Arabia-Emporium, _i.e._ one day; so we found it.\r\nThere was the greatest difficulty in getting a boat, for none of the\r\nships wished to go to Aden, for fear of quarantine, as they would be\r\nsupposed to be coming from the plague-stricken Bombay. My husband\r\npromised 100 rupees for every day, and the sultan compelled a captain\r\nwhose baggala was loaded for Mokalla to take us to Aden, by refusing to\r\ngive him his papers otherwise.\r\n\r\nOur last moments at Shukra were spent lying on the sand with our heads on\r\na bag, and sheltered by a little bit of sacking on three sticks. The\r\nsultan sat over us on a high chair, saying very polite things. We were\r\nlifted on board our ship at three o'clock, and from the ship admired\r\nShukra, which looked very picturesque in the evening haze, with its\r\ntowers, its few trees, and its many-peaked Goddam mountains behind. We\r\nreached Aden at three next afternoon. This is all I can write about this\r\njourney. It would have been better told, but that I only am left to tell\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n_LIST OF PLANTS FROM DHOFAR MOUNTAINS, SOUTH-EAST ARABIA, COMMUNICATED BY\r\nJ.

Smith, F.Z.S., Assistant Keeper of Zoology, British Museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the researches of Mr. and Mrs. Bent, only forty-eight land\r\nand freshwater molluscs had been recorded from Sokotra. In addition to\r\ntwenty-three of these species, they were fortunate in obtaining eleven\r\nnew forms, some of them very remarkable. These have been described and\r\nfigured by the writer in the 'Journal of Malacology,' vol. vi. pp. 33-38,\r\nplate v., figs. 1-9. and in the 'Bulletin of the Liverpool Museum,' vol.\r\nii. No. 1, p. 12. The British Museum is much indebted to Mrs. Bent for\r\nthe donation of this valuable collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Terrestrial Species\r\n\r\n 1.  Buliminus Passamaianus\r\n 2.

Planorbis sp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe bought in Aden a fragment of alabasteroid limestone, said to have come\r\nfrom the Hadhramout. It is broken on all sides. It is part of a\r\nperpendicular series of sunken square fields, on each of which is\r\nrepresented in flat relief a sitting or lying goat or chamois with\r\nenormous horns. My fragment has two complete goats and parts of another\r\nabove as well as below. The goats look to the right, and there are some\r\ncuttings which may have been part of an inscription on the surface of the\r\nstone to the right of the column of goats. The squares are 4 inches high\r\nby 3½ inches wide--10 centimetres by about 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRAGMENT OF ALABASTEROID LIMESTONE]\r\n\r\nThat these goats must have some significance is clear from their likeness\r\nto the following objects in the Hof Museum at Vienna, and figured in 'Süd\r\nArabische Alterthümer,' by Prof. Dr. D. H. Müller. The first is the lower\r\npart of a slab, complete on three sides with a plain surface down the\r\nmiddle, and columns of goats in squares just like that described above,\r\non either side, the goat facing inwards. In neither of these cases can\r\none know how many goats were originally represented.\r\n\r\nThe second is an architectural fragment composed of alabasteroid\r\nlimestone (yellowish in colour), 0.120 centimetres high, 0.202 long, 0.15\r\nthick (so far as it remains).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nIt represents seven chamois (or goats) lying in a row. The heads are\r\ncoarsely formed, the eyes like knobs, and the bodies of the two animals\r\nwhich are outside are indicated in profile. The original use of the\r\nobject is uncertain, but, in any case, it must have been a topmost\r\nornament, for the under-side, though regularly smoothed, is not polished\r\nlike the other surfaces, and therefore cannot have been meant to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe trough which we brought from Al Gran is of the same stone as the\r\nformer objects. It is 2 feet long by 11 inches wide and 4 inches high. It\r\nhas an inscription containing a dedication to the God Sayan or Seiyin\r\nrunning all round it and finishing on one side of the top. In the top\r\nthere is a depression sloping towards a spout, which is now broken off\r\nall but an inch. The depth of the depression is from one quarter to half\r\nan inch, and the channel in the spout runs down to three-quarters of an\r\ninch. Prof. Dr. D. H. Müller has kindly translated this inscription,\r\nwhich appears to represent it as an altar. He thinks it must be for\r\nfrankincense, but I think it must have been for some liquid. The\r\ninscription on the end opposite the spout is worn by marks of ropes being\r\ndragged against it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sabæan Antiquities\r\n\r\n1. The Seal of Yarsahal (front view).\r\n2.

The Seal of Yarsahal (side view).\r\n8. An Alabaster Lamp (bottom).\r\n9. Fragment of a Himyaritic Inscription.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe bought an object of fine alabaster in Aden. It was said to come from\r\nthe Hadhramout. It seems like a seal or stamp and has a hollow round the\r\nback, with spouts in either of the short sides. It had been used as a\r\nlamp when we obtained it. There is a kind of handle or tube pierced\r\nthrough to the front, probably for suspension.\r\n\r\nIn the same illustration are also part of an earthenware stamp and the\r\nseal of _Yarsahal, the younger of Shibahm_, with its golden setting, and\r\na copper seal with _Sabota_ on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Letters Distinguishable of an almost obliterated\r\ninscription near Haidi village, near Kalenzia, Sokotra, copied by\r\nTheodore Bent]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crosses at _Dihaiterere_ on the hill Ditrerre, a spur\r\nof Hamar, Sokotra.
