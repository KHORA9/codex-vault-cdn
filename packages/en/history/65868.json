MUNSEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nBY THE EDITOR OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is truer, perhaps, of a newspaper than of most other complex things\r\nin the world that the whole may be greater than the sum of all its\r\nparts. In any daily paper worth a moment’s consideration the least\r\nfancifully inclined observer will discern an individuality apart from\r\nand in a degree independent of the dozens or hundreds or thousands of\r\npersonal values entering at a given time into the composite of its grey\r\npages.\r\n\r\nThis entity of the institution, as distinguished from the human beings\r\nactually engaged in carrying it on, this fact of the newspaper’s\r\npossession of a separate countenance, a spirit or soul differentiating\r\nit from all others of its kind, is recognised either consciously or\r\nunconsciously by both the more or less unimportant workers who help\r\nto make it and by their silent partners who support it by buying and\r\nreading it. Its loyal friends and intelligent critics outside the\r\nestablishment, the Old Subscriber and the Constant Reader, form the\r\nhabit of attributing to the newspaper, as to an individual, qualities\r\nand powers beneficent or maleficent or merely foolish, according to\r\ntheir mood or digestion. They credit it with traits of character quite\r\nas distinct as belong to any man or woman of their acquaintance. They\r\npersonify it, moreover, without much knowledge, if any, of the people\r\ndirecting and producing it; and, often and naturally, without any\r\nparticular concern about who and what these people may be.\r\n\r\nOn their own side, the makers of the paper are accustomed to\r\nindividualise it as vividly as a crew does the ship. They know better\r\nthan anybody else not only how far each personal factor, each element\r\nof the composite, is modified and influenced in its workings by the\r\nother personal factors associated in the production, but also the\r\nextent to which all the personal units are influenced and modified\r\nby something not listed in the office directory or visible upon the\r\npayroll; something that was there before they came and will be there\r\nafter they go.\r\n\r\nOf course, that which has given persistent idiosyncrasy to a newspaper\r\nlike the _Sun_, for example, is accumulated tradition. That which has\r\nmade the whole count for more than the sum total of its parts, in the\r\n_Sun’s_ case as in the case of its esteemed contemporaries, is the\r\nheritage of method and expedient, the increment of standardised skill\r\nand localised imagination contributed through many years to the fund of\r\nthe paper by the forgotten worker as well as by the remembered.\r\n\r\nThe manner of growth of the great newspaper’s well-defined and\r\ncontinuous character, distinguishing it from all the rest of the\r\noffspring of the printing press, a development sometimes not radically\r\naffected by changes of personnel, of ownership, of exterior conditions\r\nand fashions set by the popular taste, is a subject over which\r\njournalistic metaphysics might easily exert itself to the verge of\r\nboredom. Fortunately there has been found a much better way to deal\r\nwith the attractive theme.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ is eighty-five years old as this book goes to press. In\r\ntelling its intimate story, from the September Tuesday which saw the\r\nbeginning of Mr. Day’s intrepid and epochal experiment, throughout the\r\ndays of the Beaches, of Dana, of Laffan, and of Reick to the time\r\nof Mr. Munsey’s purchase of the property in the summer of 1916, Mr.\r\nO’Brien has done what has never been undertaken before, so far as is\r\nknown to the writer of this introduction, for any newspaper with a\r\ncareer of considerable span.\r\n\r\nThere have been general histories of Journalism, presenting casually\r\nthe main facts of evolution and progress in the special instance.\r\nThere have been satisfactory narratives of journalistic episodes,\r\nreasonably accurate accounts of certain aspects or dynastic periods of\r\nnewspaper experience, excellent portrait biographies or autobiographies\r\nof journalists of genius and high achievement, with the eminent man\r\nusually in strong light in the foreground and his newspaper seldom\r\nnearer than the middle distance. But here, probably for the first time\r\nin literature of this sort, we have a real biography of a newspaper\r\nitself, covering the whole range of its existence, exhibiting every\r\nfunction of its organism, illustrating every quality that has been\r\nconspicuous in the successive stages of its growth. The _Sun_ is the\r\nhero of Mr. O’Brien’s “Story of the _Sun_.” The human participants\r\nfigure in their incidental relation to the main thread of its life\r\nand activities. They do their parts, big or little, as they pass in\r\ninteresting procession. When they have done their parts they disappear,\r\nas in real life, and the story goes on, just as the _Sun_ has gone on,\r\nwithout them except as they may have left their personal impress on the\r\nnewspaper’s structure or its superficial decoration.\r\n\r\nDuring no small part of its four score and five years of intelligent\r\ninterest in the world’s thoughts and doings it has been the _Sun’s_\r\nfortune to be regarded as in a somewhat exceptional sense the newspaper\r\nman’s newspaper. If in truth it has merited in any degree this\r\npeculiar distinction in the eyes of its professional brethren it\r\nmust have been by reason of originality of initiative and soundness\r\nof method; perhaps by a chronic indifference to those ancient\r\nconventions of news importance or of editorial phraseology which, when\r\nsystematically observed, are apt to result in a pale, dull, or even\r\nstupid uniformity of product. Mr. Dana wrote more than half a century\r\nago to one of his associates, “Your articles have stirred up the\r\nanimals, which you as well as I recognise as one of the great ends of\r\nlife.” Sometimes he borrowed Titania’s wand; sometimes he used a red\r\nhot poker. Not only in that great editor’s time but also in the time\r\nof his predecessors and successors the _Sun_ has held it to be a duty\r\nand a joy to assist to the best of its ability in the discouragement of\r\nanything like lethargy in the menagerie. Perhaps, again, that was one\r\nof the things that helped to make it the newspaper man’s newspaper.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it seems certain that to the students of the\r\ntheory and practice of journalism, now happily so numerous in the land,\r\nthe chronicler of one highly individual newspaper’s deeds and ways is\r\naffording an object lesson of practical value, a textbook of technical\r\nusefulness, as well as a store of authoritative history, entertaining\r\nanecdote, and suggestive professional information. And a much wider\r\naudience than is made up of newspaper workers present or to come will\r\nfind that the story of a newspaper which Mr. O’Brien has told with wit\r\nand knowledge in the pages that follow becomes naturally and inevitably\r\na swift and charming picture of the town in which that newspaper is\r\npublished throughout the period of its service to that town--the most\r\ninteresting period in the existence of the most interesting city of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine thing for the _Sun_, by all who have worked for it in\r\nits own spirit beloved, I believe, like a creature of flesh and blood\r\nand living intelligence and human virtues and failings, that through\r\nMr. Munsey’s wish it should have found in a son of its own schooling a\r\nbiographer and interpreter so sympathetically responsive to its best\r\ntraditions.\r\n\r\n                                        EDWARD P.

Day, with No Capital Except Youth and Courage,\r\n    Establishes the First Permanent Penny Newspaper.--The Curious\r\n    First Number Entirely His Own Work._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early thirties of last century the only newspapers in the city\r\nof New York were six-cent journals whose reading-matter was adapted to\r\nthe politics of men, and whose only appeal to women was their size,\r\nperfectly suited to deep pantry-shelves.\r\n\r\nDave Ramsey, a compositor on one of these sixpennies, the _Journal\r\nof Commerce_, had an obsession. It was that a penny paper, to be\r\ncalled the _Sun_, would be a success in a city full of persons whose\r\ninterest was in humanity in general, rather than in politics, and whose\r\npantry-shelves were of negligible width. Why his mind fastened on the\r\n_Sun_ as the name of this child of his vision is not known; perhaps it\r\nwas because there was a daily in London bearing that title. It was a\r\nshort name, easily written, easily spoken, easily remembered.\r\n\r\nBenjamin H. Day, another printer, worked beside Dave Ramsey in 1830.\r\nRamsey reiterated his idea to his neighbour so often that Day came to\r\nbelieve in it, although it is doubtful whether he had the great faith\r\nthat possessed Ramsey. Now that due credit has been given to Ramsey for\r\nthe idea of the penny _Sun_, he passes out of the record, for he never\r\nattempted to put his project into execution.\r\n\r\nNor was Day’s enthusiasm for a penny _Sun_ so big that he plunged into\r\nit at once. He was a business man rather than a visionary. With the\r\nsavings from his wages as a compositor he went into the job-printing\r\nbusiness in a small way. He still met his old chums and still talked of\r\nthe _Sun_, but it is likely that he never would have come to start it\r\nif it had not been for the cholera.\r\n\r\nThere was an epidemic of this plague in New York in 1832. It killed\r\nmore than thirty-five hundred people in that year, and added to the\r\ndepression of business already caused by financial disturbances and a\r\nwretched banking system. The job-printing trade suffered with other\r\nindustries, and Day decided that he needed a newspaper--not to reform,\r\nnot to uplift, not to arouse, but to push the printing business of\r\nBenjamin H. Day. Incidentally he might add lustre to the fame of the\r\nPresident, Andrew Jackson, or uphold the hands of the mayor of New\r\nYork, Gideon Lee; but his prime purpose was to get the work of printing\r\nhandbills for John Smith, the grocer, or letter-heads for Richard\r\nRobinson, the dealer in hay. Incidentally he might become rich and\r\npowerful, but for the time being he needed work at his trade.\r\n\r\nBen Day was only twenty-three years old. He was the son of Henry Day, a\r\nhatter of West Springfield, Massachusetts, and Mary Ely Day; and sixth\r\nin descent from his first American ancestor, Robert Day. Shortly after\r\nthe establishment of the Springfield _Republican_ by Samuel Bowles,\r\nin 1824, young Day went into the office of that paper, then a weekly,\r\nto learn the printer’s trade. That was two years before the birth of\r\nthe second and greater Samuel Bowles, who was later to make the\r\n_Republican_, as a daily, one of the greatest of American newspapers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BENJAMIN H. DAY\r\n    A Bust in the Possession of Mrs. Florence A. Snyder, Summit, N. J.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDay learned well his trade from Sam Bowles. When he was twenty, and a\r\nfirst-class compositor, he went to New York, and worked at the case in\r\nthe offices of the _Evening Post_ and the _Commercial Advertiser_. He\r\nmarried, when he was twenty-one, Miss Eveline Shepard. At the time of\r\nthe _Sun’s_ founding Mr. Day lived, with his wife and their infant son,\r\nHenry, at 75 Duane Street, only a few blocks from the newspaper offices.\r\n\r\nDay was a good-looking young man with a round, calm, resolute face. He\r\npossessed health, industry, and character. Also he had courage, for\r\na man with a family was taking no small risk in launching, without\r\ncapital, a paper to be sold at one cent.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a penny paper was not new. In Philadelphia, the _Cent_\r\nhad had a brief, inglorious existence. In Boston, the _Bostonian_ had\r\nfailed to attract the cultured readers of the modern Athens. Eight\r\nmonths before Day’s hour arrived the _Morning Post_ had braved it in\r\nNew York, selling first at two cents and later at one cent, but even\r\nwith Horace Greeley as one of the founders it lasted only three weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen Ben Day sounded his friends, particularly the printers, as to\r\ntheir opinion of his project, they cited the doleful fate of the\r\nother penny journals. He drew, or had designed, a head-line for\r\nthe _Sun_ that was to be, and took it about to his cronies. A. S.\r\nAbell, a printer on the _Mercantile Advertiser_, poked the most fun\r\nat him. A penny paper, indeed! But this same Abell lived to stop\r\nscoffing, to found another _Sun_--this one in Baltimore--and to buy a\r\nhalf-million-dollar estate out of the profits of it. He was the second\r\nbeneficiary of the penny _Sun_ idea.\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Swain, another journeyman printer, also made light of\r\nDay’s ambition. He lived to be Day’s foreman, and later to own the\r\nPhiladelphia _Public Ledger_. He told Day that the penny _Sun_ would\r\nruin him. As Day had not much enthusiasm at the outset, surely his\r\nfriends did not add to it, unless by kindling his stubbornness.\r\n\r\nAs for capital, he had none at all, in the money sense. He did have a\r\nprinting-press, hardly improved from the machine of Benjamin Franklin’s\r\nday, some job-paper, and plenty of type. The press would throw off\r\ntwo hundred impressions an hour at full speed, man power. He hired a\r\nroom, twelve by sixteen feet, in the building at 222 William Street.\r\nThat building was still there, in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge\r\napproach, when the _Sun_ celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1883;\r\nbut a modern six-story envelope factory is on the site to-day.\r\n\r\nThere is no question as to the general authorship of the first\r\npaper. Day was proprietor, publisher, editor, chief pressman, and\r\nmailing-clerk. He was not a lazy man. He stayed up all the night before\r\nthat fateful Tuesday, September 3, 1833, setting with his own hands\r\nsome advertisements that were regularly appearing in the six-cent\r\npapers, for he wanted to make a show of prosperity.\r\n\r\nHe also wrote, or clipped from some out-of-town newspaper, a poem that\r\nwould fill nearly a column. He rewrote news items from the West and\r\nSouth--some of them not more than a month old. As for the snappy local\r\nnews of the day, he bought, in the small hours of that Tuesday morning,\r\na copy of the _Courier and Enquirer_, the livest of the six-cent\r\npapers, took it to the single room in William Street, clipped out or\r\nrewrote the police-court items, and set them up himself. A boy, whose\r\nname is unknown to fame, assisted him at devil’s work. A journeyman\r\nprinter, Parmlee, helped with the press when the last quoin had been\r\nmade tight in the fourth and last of the little pages.\r\n\r\nThe sun was well up in the sky before its namesake of New York\r\ncame slowly, hesitatingly, almost sadly, up over the horizon of\r\njournalism--never to set! In the years to follow, the _Sun_ was to have\r\nchanges in ownership, in policy, in size, and in style, but no week-day\r\nwas to come when it could not shine. Of all the morning newspapers\r\nprinted in New York on that 3rd of September, 1833, there is only one\r\nother--the _Journal of Commerce_--left.\r\n\r\nBut young Mr. Day, wiping the ink from his hands at noon, and waiting\r\nin doubt to see whether the public would buy the thousand _Suns_ he had\r\nprinted, could not foresee this. Neither could he know that, by this\r\nhumble effort to exalt his printing business, he had driven a knife\r\ninto the sclerotic heart of ancient journalism. The sixpenny papers\r\nwere to laugh at this tiny intruder--to laugh and laugh, and to die.\r\n\r\nThe size of the first _Sun_ was eleven and one-quarter by eight inches,\r\nnot a great deal bigger than a sheet of commercial letter paper, and\r\nconsiderably less than one-quarter the size of a page of the _Sun_ of\r\nto-day. Compared with the first _Sun_, the present newspaper is about\r\nsixteen times larger. The type was a good, plain face of agate, with\r\nsome verse on the last page in nonpareil.\r\n\r\nAn almost perfect reprint of the first _Sun_ was issued as a supplement\r\nto the paper on its twentieth birthday, in 1853, and again--to the\r\nnumber of about one hundred and sixty thousand copies--on its fiftieth\r\nbirthday, in 1883. Many of the persons who treasure the replicas of\r\n1883 believe them to be original first numbers, as they were not\r\nlabelled “Presented gratuitously to the subscribers of the _Sun_,” as\r\nwas the issue of 1853. Hardly a month passes by but the _Sun_ receives\r\none of them from some proud owner. It is easy, however, to tell the\r\nreprint from the original, for Mr. Day in his haste committed an error\r\nat the masthead of the editorial or second page of the first number.\r\nThe date-line there reads “September 3, 1832,” while in the reprints\r\nit is “September 3, 1833,” as it should have been, but wasn’t, in the\r\noriginal. And there are minor typographical differences, invisible to\r\nthe layman.\r\n\r\nOf the thousand, or fewer, copies of the first _Sun_, only five are\r\nknown to exist--one in the bound file of the _Sun’s_ first year, held\r\njealously in the _Sun’s_ safe; one in the private library of the editor\r\nof the _Sun_, Edward Page Mitchell; one in the Public Library at Fifth\r\nAvenue and Forty-second Street, New York; and two in the library of the\r\nAmerican Type Founders Company, Jersey City.\r\n\r\nThere were three columns on each of the four pages. At the top of the\r\nfirst column on the front page was a modest announcement of the _Sun’s_\r\nambitions:\r\n\r\n    The object of this paper is to lay before the public, at a\r\n    price within the means of every one, ALL THE NEWS OF THE\r\n    DAY, and at the same time afford an advantageous medium for\r\n    advertising.\r\n\r\nIt was added that the subscription in advance was three dollars a year,\r\nand that yearly advertisers were to be accommodated with ten lines\r\nevery day for thirty dollars per annum--ten cents a day, or one cent a\r\nline. That was the old fashion of advertising. The friendly merchant\r\nbought thirty dollars’ worth of space, say in December, and inserted an\r\nadvertisement of his fur coats or snow-shovels. The same advertisement\r\nmight be in the paper the following July, for the newspapers made no\r\neffort to coordinate the needs of the seller and the buyer. So long as\r\nthe merchant kept his name regularly in print, he felt that was enough.\r\n\r\nThe leading article on the first page was a semi-humorous story about\r\nan Irish captain and his duels. It was flanked by a piece of reprint\r\nconcerning microscopic carved toys. There was a paragraph about a\r\nVermont boy so addicted to whistling that he fell ill of it. Mr. Day’s\r\napprentice may have needed this warning.\r\n\r\nThe front-page advertising, culled from other newspapers and printed\r\nfor effect, consisted of the notices of steamship sailings. In one of\r\nthese Commodore Vanderbilt offered to carry passengers from New York\r\nto Hartford, by daylight, for one dollar, on his splendid low-pressure\r\nsteamboat Water Witch. Cornelius Vanderbilt was then thirty-nine years\r\nold, and had made the boat line between New York and New Brunswick, New\r\nJersey, pay him forty thousand dollars a year. When the _Sun_ started,\r\nthe commodore was at the height of his activity, and he stuck to the\r\nwater for thirty years afterward, until he had accumulated something\r\nlike forty million dollars.\r\n\r\nE. K. Collins had not yet established his famous Dramatic line of\r\nclipper-ships between New York and Liverpool, but he advertised the\r\n“very fast sailing coppered ship Nashville for New Orleans.” He was\r\nonly thirty then.\r\n\r\nCooks were advertised for by private families living in Broadway, near\r\nCanal Street--pretty far up-town to live at that day--and in Temple\r\nStreet, near Liberty, pretty far down-town now.\r\n\r\nOn the second page was a bit of real news, the melancholy suicide of\r\na young Bostonian of “engaging manners and amiable disposition,” in\r\nWebb’s Congress Hall, a hotel. There were also two local anecdotes; a\r\nparagraph to the effect that “the city is nearly full of strangers\r\nfrom all parts of this country and Europe”; nine police-court items,\r\nnearly all concerning trivial assaults; news of murders committed in\r\nFlorida, at Easton, Pennsylvania, and at Columbus, Ohio; a report of an\r\nearthquake at Charlottesville, Virginia, and a few lines of stray news\r\nfrom Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe third page had the arrivals and clearances at the port of New\r\nYork, a joke about the cholera in New Orleans, a line to say that the\r\nsame disease had appeared in the City of Mexico, an item about an\r\ninsurrection in the Ohio penitentiary, a marriage announcement, a death\r\nnotice, some ship and auction advertisements, and the offer of a reward\r\nof one thousand dollars for the recovery of thirteen thousand six\r\nhundred dollars stolen from the mail stage between Boston and Lynn and\r\nthe arrest of the thieves.\r\n\r\nThe last page carried a poem, “A Noon Scene,” but the atmosphere was of\r\nthe Elysian Fields over in Hoboken rather than of midday in the city.\r\nWhen Day scissored it, probably he did so with the idea that it would\r\nfill a column. Another good filler was the bank-note table, copied from\r\na six-cent contemporary. The quotations indicated that not much of the\r\nbank currency of the day was accepted at par.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the page was filled with borrowed advertising. The Globe\r\nInsurance Company, of which John Jacob Astor was a director, announced\r\nthat it had a capital of a million dollars. The North River Insurance\r\nCompany, whose directorate included William B. Astor, declared its\r\nwillingness to insure against fire and against “loss or damage by\r\ninland navigation.” At that time the boilers of river steamboats had an\r\nunpleasant trick of blowing up; hence Commodore Vanderbilt’s mention\r\nof the low pressure of the Water Witch. John A. Dix, then Secretary\r\nof State of the State of New York, and later to be the hero of the\r\n“shoot him on the spot” order, advertised an election. Castleton House\r\nAcademy, on Staten Island, offered to teach and board young gentlemen\r\nat twenty-five dollars a quarter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIRST ISSUE OF “THE SUN”]\r\n\r\nSuch was the first _Sun_. Part of it was stale news, rewritten. Part\r\nwas borrowed advertising. It is doubtful whether even the police-court\r\nitems were original, although they were the most human things in\r\nthe issue, the most likely to appeal to the readers whom Day hoped\r\nto reach--people to whom the purchase of a paper at six cents was\r\nimpossible, and to whom windy, monotonous political discussions were a\r\nbore.\r\n\r\nIn those early thirties, daily journalism had not advanced very far.\r\nMen were willing, but means and methods were weak. The first English\r\ndaily was the _Courrant_, issued in 1702. The _Orange Postman_, put out\r\nthe following year, was the first penny paper. The London _Times_ was\r\nnot started until 1785. It was the first English paper to use a steam\r\npress, as the _Sun_ was the first American paper.\r\n\r\nThe first American daily was the _Pennsylvania Packet_, called later\r\nthe _General Advertiser_, begun in Philadelphia in 1784. It died in\r\n1837. Of the existing New York papers only the _Globe_ dates back to\r\nthe eighteenth century, having been founded in 1797 as the _Commercial\r\nAdvertiser_. Next to it in age is the _Evening Post_, started in 1801.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the early dailies was largely due to the fact that\r\ntheir publishers looked almost entirely to advertising for the support\r\nof the papers. On the other hand, the editors were politicians or\r\nhighbrows who thought more of a speech by Lord Piccadilly on empire\r\nthan of a good street tragedy; more of an essay by Lady Geraldine Glue\r\nthan of a first-class report of a kidnapping.\r\n\r\nAnother great obstacle to success--one for which neither editor\r\nnor publisher was responsible--was the lack of facilities for the\r\ntransmission of news. Fulton launched the Clermont twenty-six years\r\nbefore Day launched the _Sun_, but even in Day’s time steamships\r\nwere nothing to brag of, and the first of them was yet to cross the\r\nAtlantic. When the _Sun_ was born, the most important railroad in\r\nAmerica was thirty-four miles long, from Bordentown to South Amboy,\r\nNew Jersey. There was no telegraph, and the mails were of pre-historic\r\nslowness.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to get out a successful daily newspaper without daily\r\nnews. A weekly would have sufficed for the information that came in,\r\nby sailing ship and stage, from Europe and Washington and Boston. Ben\r\nDay was the first man to reconcile himself to an almost impossible\r\nsituation. He did so by the simple method of using what news was\r\nnearest at hand--the incidental happenings of New York life. In this\r\nway he solved his own problem and the people’s, for they found that the\r\nlocal items in the _Sun_ were just what they wanted, while the price of\r\nthe paper suited them well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD OF THE LITTLE “SUN”\r\n\r\n  _A Very Small Metropolis Which Day and His Partner, Wisner, Awoke\r\n    by Printing Small Human Pieces About Small Human Beings and\r\n    Having Boys Cry the Paper._\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far could the little _Sun_ hope to cast its beam in a stodgy if not\r\nnaughty world? The circulation of all the dailies in New York at the\r\ntime was less than thirty thousand. The seven morning and four evening\r\npapers, all sold at six cents a copy, shared the field thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MORNING PAPERS\r\n\r\n  _Morning Courier and New York Enquirer_            4,500\r\n  _Democratic Chronicle_                             4,000\r\n  New York _Standard_                                2,400\r\n  New York _Journal of Commerce_                     2,300\r\n  New York _Gazette and General Advertiser_          1,500\r\n  New York _Daily Advertiser_                        1,400\r\n  _Mercantile Advertiser and New York Advocate_      1,200\r\n\r\n\r\n    EVENING PAPERS\r\n\r\n  _Evening Post_                                     3,000\r\n  _Evening Star_                                     2,500\r\n  New York _Commercial Advertiser_                   2,100\r\n  New York _American_                                1,600\r\n                                                     -----\r\n    Total                                           26,500\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York was the American metropolis, but it was of about the present\r\nsize of Indianapolis or Seattle. Of its quarter of a million\r\npopulation, only eight or ten thousand lived above Twenty-third Street.\r\nWashington Square, now the residence district farthest down-town, had\r\njust been adopted as a park; before that it had been the Potter’s\r\nField. In 1833 rich New Yorkers were putting up some fine residences\r\nthere--of which a good many still stand. Sixth Street had had its name\r\nchanged to Waverley Place in honor of Walter Scott, recently dead, the\r\nliterary king of the day.\r\n\r\nWall Street was already the financial centre, with its Merchants’\r\nExchange, banks, brokers, and insurance companies. Canal Street\r\nwas pretty well filled with retail stores. Third Avenue had been\r\nmacadamized from the Bowery to Harlem. The down-town streets were\r\npaved, and some were lighted with gas at seven dollars a thousand cubic\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nColumbia College, in the square bounded by Murray, Barclay, Church, and\r\nChapel Streets, had a hundred students; now it has more than a hundred\r\nhundred. James Kent was professor of law in the Columbia of that day,\r\nand Charles Anthon was professor of Greek and Latin. A rival seat of\r\nlearning, the University of the City of New York, chartered two years\r\nearlier, was temporarily housed at 12 Chambers Street, with a certain\r\nSamuel F. B. Morse as professor of sculpture and painting. There\r\nwere twelve schools, harbouring six thousand pupils, whose welfare\r\nwas guarded by the Public School Society of New York, Lindley Murray\r\nsecretary. The National Academy of Design, incorporated five years\r\nbefore, guided the budding artist in Clinton Hall, and Mr. Morse was\r\nits president, while it had for its professor of mythology one William\r\nCullen Bryant.\r\n\r\nAlbert Gallatin was president of the National Bank, at 13 Wall Street.\r\nOften at the end of his day’s work he would walk around to the\r\nsmall shop in William Street where his young friend Delmonico, the\r\nconfectioner, was trying to interest the gourmets of the city in his\r\nFrench cooking. Gideon Lee, besides being mayor, was president of\r\nthe Leather Manufacturers’ Bank at 334 Pearl Street. He was the last\r\nmayor of New York to be appointed by the common council, for Dix’s\r\nadvertisement in the first _Sun_ called an election by which the people\r\nof the city gained the right to elect a mayor by popular vote.\r\n\r\nA list of the solid citizens of the New York of that year would\r\ninclude Peter Schermerhorn, Nicholas Fish, Robert Lenox, Sheppard\r\nKnapp, Samuel Swartwout, Henry Beekman, Henry Delafield, John Mason,\r\nWilliam Paulding, David S. Kennedy, Jacob Lorillard, David Lydig,\r\nSeth Grosvenor, Elisha Riggs, John Delafield, Peter A. Jay, C. V. S.\r\nRoosevelt, Robert Ray, Preserved Fish, Morris Ketchum, Rufus Prime,\r\nPhilip Hone, William Vail, Gilbert Coutant, and Mortimer Livingston.\r\n\r\nThese men and their fellows ran the banks and the big business of\r\nthat day. They read the six-cent papers, mostly those which warned\r\nthe public that Andrew Jackson was driving the country to the devil.\r\nIt would be years before the _Sun_ would bring the light of common,\r\neveryday things into their dignified lives--if it ever did so. Day,\r\nthe printer, did not look to them to read his paper, although he hoped\r\nfor some small part of their advertising. It is likely that one of the\r\nGouverneurs--Samuel L.--read the early _Sun_, but he was postmaster,\r\nand it was his duty to examine new and therefore suspicionable\r\npublications.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, Postmaster Gouverneur had one clerk to sort all the mail\r\nthat came into the city from the rest of the world. It was a small\r\nNew York upon which the timid _Sun_ cast its still smaller beams. The\r\nmass of the people had not been interested in newspapers, because the\r\nnewspapers brought nothing into their lives but the drone of American\r\nand foreign politics. A majority of them were in sympathy with Tammany\r\nHall, particularly since 1821, when the property qualification was\r\nremoved from the franchise through Democratic effort.\r\n\r\nNew York had literary publications other than the six-cent papers. The\r\n_Knickerbocker Magazine_ was founded in January of 1833, with Charles\r\nHoffman, assistant editor of the _American Magazine_, as editor.\r\nAmong the contributors engaged were William Cullen Bryant and James\r\nK. Paulding. The subscription-list, it was proudly announced, had\r\nno fewer than eight hundred names on it. The _Mechanics’ Magazine_,\r\nthe _Sporting Magazine_, the _American Ploughboy_, the _Journal of\r\nPublic Morals_, and the _Youth’s Temperance Lecturer_ were among the\r\nperiodicals that contended for public favour.\r\n\r\nBryant was a busy man, for he was the chief editor of the _Evening\r\nPost_ as well as a magazine contributor and a teacher. Fame had come to\r\nhim early, for “Thanatopsis” was published when he was twenty-three,\r\nand “To a Water-fowl” appeared a year later, in 1818. Now, in his\r\nthirties, he was no longer the delicate youth, the dreamy poet. One\r\nApril day in 1831 Bryant and William L. Stone, one of the editors of\r\nthe _Commercial Advertiser_, had a rare fight in front of the City\r\nHall, the poet beginning it with a cowskin whip swung at Stone’s head,\r\nand the spectators ending it after Stone had seized the whip. These two\r\nwere editors of sixpenny “respectables.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE FIRST HOME OF “THE SUN,” 222 WILLIAM STREET\r\n    (_Under the Arrow_)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE SECOND HOME OF “THE SUN”\r\n\r\n    Nassau Street, from Frankfort to Spruce, in the Early Forties.\r\n    “The Sun’s” Second Home Is Shown at the Right End of the Block.\r\n    The Tammany Hall Building Became “The Sun’s” Fourth Home in\r\n    1868.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIrving and Cooper, Bryant and Halleck, Nathaniel P.

He was then fifty, and had written his best books. Cooper,\r\nhalf a dozen years younger, had long since basked in the glory that\r\ncame to him with the publication of “The Spy,” “The Pilot,” and “The\r\nLast of the Mohicans.” He and Irving were guests at every cultured\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nPrescott was finishing his first work, “The History of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella.” Bancroft was beginning his “History of the United States.”\r\nGeorge Ticknor had written his “Life of Lafayette.” Hawthorne had\r\npublished only “Fanshawe” and some of the “Twice Told Tales.” Poe was\r\nstruggling along in Baltimore. Holmes, a medical student, had written a\r\nfew poems. Dr. John William Draper, later to write his great “History\r\nof the Intellectual Development of Europe,” arrived from Liverpool that\r\nyear to make New York his home.\r\n\r\nLongfellow was professor of modern languages at Bowdoin, and unknown to\r\nfame as a poet. Whittier had written “Legends of New England” and “Moll\r\nPitcher.” Emerson was in England. Richard Henry Dana and Motley were at\r\nHarvard. Thoreau was helping his father to make lead-pencils. Parkman,\r\nLowell, and Herman Melville were schoolboys.\r\n\r\nAway off in Buffalo was a boy of fourteen who clerked in his uncle’s\r\ngeneral store by day, selling steel traps to Seneca braves, and by\r\nnight read Latin, Greek, poetry, history, and the speeches of Andrew\r\nJackson. His name was Charles Anderson Dana.\r\n\r\nThe leading newspaperman of the day in New York was James Watson Webb,\r\na son of the General Webb who held the Bible upon which Washington took\r\nthe oath of office as first President. J. Watson Webb had been in the\r\narmy and, as a journalist, was never for peace at any price. He united\r\nthe _Morning Courier_ and the _Enquirer_, and established a daily\r\nhorse express between New York and Washington, which is said to have\r\ncost seventy-five hundred dollars a month, in order to get news from\r\nCongress and the White House twenty-four hours before his rivals.\r\n\r\nWebb was famed as a fighter. He had a row with Duff Green in Washington\r\nin 1830. In January, 1836, he thrashed James Gordon Bennett in Wall\r\nStreet. He incited a mob to drive Wood, a singer, from the stage\r\nof the Park Theater. In 1838 he sent a challenge to Representative\r\nCilley, of Maine, a classmate of Longfellow and Hawthorne at Bowdoin.\r\nCilley refused to fight, on the ground that he had made no personal\r\nreflections on Webb’s character; whereupon Representative Graves, of\r\nKentucky, who carried the card for Webb, challenged Cilley for himself,\r\nas was the custom. They fought with rifles on the Annapolis Road, and\r\nCilley was killed at the third shot.\r\n\r\nIn 1842 Webb fought a duel with Representative Marshall, of Kentucky,\r\nand not only was wounded, but on his return to New York was sentenced\r\nto two years in prison “for leaving the State with the intention of\r\ngiving or receiving a challenge.” At the end of two weeks, however, he\r\nwas pardoned.\r\n\r\nHaving deserted Jackson and become a Whig, Webb continued to own and\r\nedit the _Courier and Enquirer_ until 1861, when it was merged with the\r\n_World_. His quarrels, all of political origin, brought prestige to his\r\npaper. Ben Day had no duelling-pistols. His only chance to advertise\r\nthe _Sun_ was by its own light and its popular price.\r\n\r\nBeyond Webb, Day had no lively journalist with whom to contend at the\r\noutset, and Webb probably did not dream that the _Sun_ would be worthy\r\nof a joust. Perhaps fortunately for Day, Horace Greeley had just\r\nfailed in his attempt to run a one-cent paper. This was the _Morning\r\nPost_, which Greeley started in January, 1833, with Francis V. Story, a\r\nfellow printer, as his partner, and with a capital of one hundred and\r\nfifty dollars. It ran for three weeks only.\r\n\r\nGreeley and Story still had some type, bought on credit, and they\r\nissued a tri-weekly, the _Constitutionalist_, which, in spite of its\r\ndignified title, was the avowed organ of the lotteries. Its columns\r\ncontained the following card:\r\n\r\n    Greeley & Story, No. 54 Liberty Street, New York, respectfully\r\n    solicit the patronage of the public to their business of\r\n    letterpress printing, particularly lottery-printing, such as\r\n    schemes, periodicals, and so forth, which will be executed on\r\n    favorable terms.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that at that time lotteries were not under a\r\ncloud. There were in New York forty-five lottery offices, licensed at\r\ntwo hundred and fifty dollars apiece annually, and the proceeds were\r\ndivided between the public schools and a home for deaf-mutes. That was\r\nthe last year of legalized lotteries. After they disappeared Greeley\r\nstarted the _New Yorker_, the best literary weekly of its time. It was\r\nnot until April, 1841, that he founded the _Tribune_.\r\n\r\nDoubtless there were many young New Yorkers of that period who would\r\nhave made bang-up reporters, but apparently, until Day’s time, with few\r\nexceptions they did not work on morning newspapers. One exception was\r\nJames Gordon Bennett, whose work for Webb on the _Courier and Enquirer_\r\nhelped to make it the leading American paper.\r\n\r\nNathaniel P. Willis and George P. Morris would probably have been good\r\nreporters, for they knew New York and had excellent styles, but they\r\ninsisted on being poets. With Morris it was not a hollow vocation,\r\nfor the author of “Woodman, Spare That Tree,” could always get fifty\r\ndollars for a song. He and Willis ran the _Mirror_ and later the _New\r\nMirror_, and wrote verse and other fanciful stuff by the bushel. Philip\r\nHone would have been the best reporter in New York, as his diary\r\nreveals, but he was of the aristocracy, and he seems to have scorned\r\nnewspapermen, particularly Webb and Bennett.\r\n\r\nBut somehow, by that chance which seemed to smile on the _Sun_, Ben\r\nDay got clever reporters. He wanted one to do the police-court work,\r\nfor he saw, from the first day of the paper, that that was the kind\r\nof stuff that his readers devoured. To them the details of a beating\r\nadministered by James Hawkins to his wife were of more import than\r\nJackson’s assaults on the United States Bank.\r\n\r\nWhen George W. Wisner, a young printer who was out of work, applied to\r\nthe _Sun_ for a job, Day told him that he would give him four dollars\r\na week if he would get up early every day and attend the police-court,\r\nwhich held its sessions from 4 A.M. on. The people of the city were\r\nquite as human then as they are to-day. Unregenerate mortals got drunk\r\nand fought in the streets. Others stole shoes. The worst of all beat\r\ntheir wives. Wisner was to be the Balzac of the daybreak court in a\r\nyear when Balzac himself was writing his “Droll Stories.”\r\n\r\nThe second issue of the _Sun_ continued the typographical error of the\r\nday before. The year in the date-line of the second page was “1832.”\r\nThe big news in this paper was under date of Plymouth, England, August\r\n1, and it told of the capture of Lisbon by Admiral Napier on the 25th\r\nof July. Day--or perhaps it was Wisner--wrote an editorial article\r\nabout it:\r\n\r\n    To us as Americans there can be little of interest in the\r\n    triumph of one member of a royal family of Europe over another;\r\n    and although we can but rejoice at the downfall of the modern\r\n    Nero who so lately filled the Portuguese throne, yet if rumor\r\n    speak the truth the victorious Pedro is no better than he\r\n    should be.\r\n\r\nThe editor lamented the general lack of news:\r\n\r\n    With the exception of the interesting news from Portugal there\r\n    appears to be very little worthy of note. Nullification has\r\n    blown over; the President’s tour has terminated; Black Hawk has\r\n    gone home; the new race for President is not yet commenced, and\r\n    everything seems settled down into a calm. Dull times, these,\r\n    for us newspaper-makers. We wish the President or Major Downing\r\n    or some other distinguished individual would happen along again\r\n    and afford us material for a daily article. Or even if the\r\n    sea-serpent would be so kind as to pay us a visit, we should be\r\n    extremely obliged to him and would honor his snakeship with a\r\n    most tremendous puff.\r\n\r\nTheatrical advertising appeared in this number, the Park Theater\r\nannouncing the comedy of “Rip Van Winkle,” as redramatized by Mr.\r\nHackett, who played _Rip_. Mr. Gale was playing “Mazeppa” at the\r\nBowery. Perhaps these advertisements were borrowed from a six-cent\r\npaper, but there was one “help wanted” advertisement that was not\r\nborrowed. It was the upshot of Day’s own idea, destined to bring\r\nanother revolution in newspaper methods:\r\n\r\n    TO THE UNEMPLOYED--A number of steady men can find employment\r\n    by vending this paper. A liberal discount is allowed to those\r\n    who buy to sell again.\r\n\r\nBefore that day there had been no newsboys; no papers were sold in\r\nthe streets. The big, blanket political organs that masqueraded as\r\nnewspapers were either sold over the counter or delivered by carriers\r\nto the homes of the subscribers. Most of the publishers considered it\r\nundignified even to angle for new subscribers, and one of them boasted\r\nthat his great circulation of perhaps two thousand had come unsolicited.\r\n\r\nThe first unemployed person to apply for a job selling _Suns_ in the\r\nstreets was a ten-year-old-boy, Bernard Flaherty, born in Cork. Years\r\nafterward two continents knew him as Barney Williams, Irish comedian,\r\nhero of “The Emerald Ring,” and “The Connie Soogah,” and at one time\r\nmanager of Wallack’s old Broadway Theatre.\r\n\r\nWhen Day got some regular subscribers, he sent carriers on routes. He\r\ncharged them sixty-seven cents a hundred, cash, or seventy-five cents\r\non credit. The first of these carriers was Sam Messenger, who delivered\r\nthe _Sun_ in the Fulton Market district, and who later became a rich\r\nlivery-stable keeper. Live lads like these, carrying out Day’s idea,\r\nwrought the greatest change in journalism that ever had been made,\r\nfor they brought the paper to the people, something that could not\r\nbe accomplished by the six-cent sheets with their lofty notions and\r\ncomparatively high prices.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of the _Sun’s_ life, with Wisner at the pen and\r\nBarney Flaherty “hollering” in the startled streets, the editor again\r\nexpressed, this time more positively, his yearning that something would\r\nhappen:\r\n\r\n    We newspaper people thrive best on the calamities of others.\r\n    Give us one of your real Moscow fires, or your Waterloo\r\n    battle-fields; let a Napoleon be dashing with his legions\r\n    through the world, overturning the thrones of a thousand years\r\n    and deluging the world with blood and tears; and then we of the\r\n    types are in our glory.\r\n\r\nThe yearner had to wait thirty years for another Waterloo, but he got\r\nhis “real Moscow fire” in about two years, and so close that it singed\r\nhis eyebrows.\r\n\r\nLacking a Napoleon to exalt or denounce, Mr. Day used a bit of that\r\nsame page for the publication of homelier news for the people:\r\n\r\n    The following are the drawn numbers of the New York\r\n    consolidated lotteries of yesterday afternoon:\r\n\r\n  62 6 59 46 61 34 65 37 8 42\r\n\r\n\r\nSo Horace Greeley and his partner, with their tri-weekly paper, could\r\nnot have been keeping all of the lottery patronage away from the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nOver in the police column Mr. Wisner was supplying gems like the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    A complaint was made by several persons who “thought it no sin\r\n    to step to the notes of a sweet violin” and gathered under a\r\n    window in Chatham Street, where a little girl was playing on a\r\n    violin, when they were showered from a window above with the\r\n    contents of a dye-pot or something of like nature. They were\r\n    directed to ascertain their showerer.\r\n\r\nThe big story on the first page of the fourth issue of the _Sun_ was a\r\nconversation between _Envy_ and _Candor_ in regard to the beauties of\r\na Miss H., perhaps a fictitious person. But on the second page, at the\r\nhead of the editorial column, was a real editorial article approving\r\nthe course of the British government in freeing the slaves in the West\r\nIndies:\r\n\r\n    We supposed that the eyes of men were but half open to this\r\n    case. We imagined that the slave would have to toil on for\r\n    years and _purchase_ what in justice was already _his own_.\r\n    We did not once dream that light had so far progressed as to\r\n    prepare the British nation for the colossal stride in justice\r\n    and humanity and benevolence which they are about to make.\r\n    The abolition of West Indian slavery will form a brilliant\r\n    era in the annals of the world. It will circle with a halo of\r\n    imperishable glory the brows of the transcendent spirits who\r\n    wield the present destinies of the British Empire.\r\n\r\n    Would to Heaven that the honor of leading the way in this\r\n    godlike enterprise had been reserved to our own country! But as\r\n    the opportunity for this is passed, we trust we shall at least\r\n    avoid the everlasting disgrace of long refusing to imitate so\r\n    bright and glorious an example.\r\n\r\nThus the _Sun_ came out for the freedom of the slave twenty-eight years\r\nbefore that freedom was to be accomplished in the United States through\r\nwar. The _Sun_ was the _Sun_ of Day, but the hand was the hand of\r\nWisner. That young man was an Abolitionist before the word was coined.\r\n\r\n“Wisner was a pretty smart young fellow,” said Mr. Day nearly fifty\r\nyears afterward, “but he and I never agreed. I was rather Democratic in\r\nmy notions. Wisner, whenever he got a chance, was always sticking in\r\nhis damned little Abolitionist articles.”\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that Wisner wrote the article facing the _Sun_\r\nagainst slavery while he was waiting for something to turn up in the\r\npolice-court. Then he went to the office, set up the article, as well\r\nas his piece about the arrest of Eliza Barry, of Bayard Street, for\r\nstealing a wash-tub, and put the type in the form. Considering that\r\nWisner got four dollars a week for his break-o’-day work, he made\r\na very good morning of that; and it is worthy of record that the\r\nnext day’s _Sun_ did not repudiate his assault on human servitude,\r\nalthough on September 10 Mr. Day printed an editorial grieving over the\r\nexistence of slavery, but hitting at the methods of the Abolitionists.\r\n\r\nThese early issues were full of lively little “sunny” pieces, for\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n    Passing by the Beekman Street church early this morning, we\r\n    discovered a milkman replenishing his lacteous cargo with\r\n    Adam’s ale. We took the liberty to ask him, “Friend, why do ye\r\n    do thus?” He replied, “None of your business”; and we passed\r\n    on, determined to report him to the Grahamites.\r\n\r\nA poem on Burns, by Halleck--perhaps reprinted from one of the author’s\r\npublished volumes of verse--added literary tone to that morning’s _Sun_.\r\n\r\nIn the next issue was some verse by Willis, beginning:\r\n\r\n  Look not upon the wine when it\r\n  Is red within the cup!\r\n\r\nThen, and for some years afterward, the _Sun_ exhibited a special\r\naversion to alcohol in text and head-lines. “Cursed Effects of Rum!”\r\nwas one of its favourite head-lines.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ was a week old before it contained dramatic criticism, its\r\nfirst subject in that field being the appearance of Mr. and Mrs. Wood\r\nat the Park Theatre in “Cinderella,” a comic opera. The paper’s first\r\nanimal story was printed on September 12, recording the fact that on\r\nthe previous Sunday about sixty wild pigeons stayed in a tree at the\r\nBattery nearly half an hour.\r\n\r\nOn September 14 the _Sun_ printed its first illustration--a two-column\r\ncut of “Herschel’s Forty-Feet Telescope.” This was Sir W. Herschel,\r\nthen dead some ten years, and the telescope was on his grounds at\r\nSlough, near Windsor, England. Another knighted Herschel with another\r\ntelescope in a far land was to play a big part in the fortunes of the\r\n_Sun_, but that comes later. In the issue with the cut of the telescope\r\nwas a paragraph about a rumour that Fanny Kemble, who had just\r\ncaptivated American theatregoers, had been married to Pierce Butler, of\r\nPhiladelphia--as, indeed, she had.\r\n\r\nBroadway seems to have had its lure as early as 1833, for in the _Sun_\r\nof September 17, on the first page, is a plaint by “Citizen”:\r\n\r\n    They talk of the pleasures of the country, but would to God I\r\n    had never been persuaded to leave the labor of the city for\r\n    such woful pleasures. Oh, Broadway, Broadway! In an evil hour\r\n    did I forsake thee for verdant walks and flowery landscapes\r\n    and that there tiresome piece of made water. What walk is so\r\n    agreeable as a walk through the streets of New York? What\r\n    landscape more flowery than those of the print-shops? And what\r\n    water was made by man equal to the Hudson?\r\n\r\nThis was followed by uplifting little essays on “Suicide” and\r\n“Robespierre.” The chief news of the day--that John Quincy Adams had\r\naccepted a nomination from the Anti-Masons--was on an inside page.\r\nWhat was possibly of more interest to the readers, it was announced\r\nthat thereafter a ton of coal would be two thousand pounds instead\r\nof twenty-two hundred and forty--Lackawanna, broken and sifted, six\r\ndollars and fifty cents a ton.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, September 21, when it was only eighteen days old, the\r\n_Sun_ adopted a new head-line. The letters remained the same, but\r\nthe eagle device of the first issue was supplanted by the solar orb\r\nrising over hills and sea. This design was used only until December 2,\r\nwhen its place was taken by a third emblem--a printing-press shedding\r\nsymbolical effulgence upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ first book-notice appeared on September 23, when it\r\nacknowledged the sixtieth volume of the “Family Library” (Harpers),\r\nthis being a biography of Charlemagne by G. P. R. James. “It treats of\r\na most important period in the history of France.” The _Sun_ had little\r\nspace then for book-reviews or politics. Of its attitude toward the\r\ngreat financial fight then being waged, this lone paragraph gives a\r\ngood view:\r\n\r\n    The _Globe_ of Monday contains in six columns the reasons which\r\n    prompted the President to remove the public deposits from the\r\n    United States Bank, which were read to his assembled cabinet on\r\n    the 18th instant.\r\n\r\nNicholas Biddle and his friends could fill other papers with arguments,\r\nbut the _Sun_ kept its space for police items, stories of authenticated\r\nghosts, and yarns about the late Emperor Napoleon. The removal of\r\nWilliam J. Duane as Secretary of the Treasury got two lines on a page\r\nwhere a big shark caught off Barnstable got three lines, and the\r\nfeeding of the anaconda at the American Museum a quarter of a column.\r\nMiss Susan Allen, who bought a cigar on Broadway and was arrested\r\nwhen she smoked it while she danced in the street, was featured more\r\nprominently than the expected visit to New York of Mr. Henry Clay,\r\nafter whom millions of cigars were to be named. For the satisfaction of\r\nuniversal curiosity it must be reported that Miss Allen was discharged.\r\n\r\nOn October 1 of that same year--1833--the _Sun_ came out for better\r\nfire-fighting apparatus, urging that the engines should be drawn by\r\nhorses, as in London. In the same issue it assailed the gambling-house\r\nin Park Row, and scorned the allegation of Colonel Hamilton, a British\r\ntraveller, that the tooth-brush was unknown in America. Slowly the\r\npaper was getting better, printing more local news; and it could afford\r\nto, for the penny _Sun_ idea had taken hold of New York, and the sales\r\nwere larger every week.\r\n\r\nWisner was stretching the police-court pieces out to nearly two\r\ncolumns. Now and then, perhaps when Mr. Day was away fishing, the\r\nreporter would slip in an Abolition paragraph or a gloomy poem on the\r\nhorrors of slavery. But he was so valuable that, while his chief did\r\nnot raise his salary of four dollars a week, he offered him half the\r\npaper, the same to be paid for out of the profits. And so, in January\r\nof 1834, Wisner became a half-owner of the _Sun_. Benton, another _Sun_\r\nprinter, also wanted an interest, and left when he could not get it.\r\n\r\nBefore it was two months old the _Sun_ had begun to take an interest\r\nin aeronautics. It printed a full column, October 16, 1833, on the\r\nsubject of Durant’s balloon ascensions, and quoted Napoleon as saying\r\nthat the only insurmountable difficulty of the balloon in war was the\r\nimpossibility of guiding its course. “This difficulty Dr. Durant is now\r\nendeavoring to obviate.” And the _Sun_ added:\r\n\r\n    May we not therefore look to the time, in perspective, when\r\n    our atmosphere will be traversed with as much facility as our\r\n    waters?\r\n\r\nIn the issue of October 17 a skit, possibly by Mr. Day himself, gave a\r\npicture of the trials of an editor of the period:\r\n\r\n    SCENE--An editor’s closet--editor solus.\r\n\r\n    “Well, a pretty day’s work of it I shall make. News, I have\r\n    nothing--politics, stale, flat, and unprofitable--miscellany,\r\n    enough of it--miscellany bills payable, and a miscellaneous\r\n    list of subscribers with tastes as miscellaneous as the tongues\r\n    of Babel. Ha! Footsteps! Drop the first person singular and\r\n    don the plural. WE must now play the editor.”\r\n\r\n    (Enter Devil)--“Copy, sir!”\r\n\r\n    (Enter A.)--“I missed my paper this morning, sir, I don’t want\r\n    to take it--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter B.)--“There is a letter ‘o’ turned upside down in my\r\n    advertisement this morning, sir! I--I--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter C.)--“You didn’t notice my new work, my treatise on a\r\n    flea, this morning, sir! You have no literary taste! Sir--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter D.)--“Sir, your boy don’t leave my paper, sir--I live in\r\n    a blind alley; you turn out of ---- Street to the right--then\r\n    take a left-hand turn--then to the right again--then go under\r\n    an arch--then over a kennel--then jump a ten-foot fence--then\r\n    enter a door--then climb five pair of stairs--turn fourteen\r\n    corners--and you can’t miss my door. I want your boy to leave\r\n    my paper first--it’s only a mile out of his way--if he don’t,\r\n    I’ll stop--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter E.)--“Sir, you have abused my friend; the article\r\n    against Mr. ---- as a candidate is intolerable--it is\r\n    scandalous--I’ll stop my paper--I’ll cane you--I’ll--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter F.)--“Mr. Editor, you are mealy-mouthed, you lack\r\n    independence, your remarks upon Mr. ----, the candidate for\r\n    Congress, are too tame. If you don’t put it on harder I’ll stop\r\n    my--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter G.)--“Your remarks upon profane swearing are personal,\r\n    d----n you, sir, you mean me--before I’ll patronize you longer\r\n    I’ll see you in ----”\r\n\r\n    (Enter H.)--“Mr. ----, we are very sorry you do not say more\r\n    against the growing sin of profanity. Unless you put your veto\r\n    on it more decidedly, no man of correct moral principles will\r\n    give you his patronage--I, for one--”\r\n\r\n    (Enter I.)--“Bad luck to the dirty sowl of him, where does he\r\n    keep himself? By the powers, I’ll strike him if I can get at\r\n    his carcass, and I’ll kick him anyhow! Why do you fill your\r\n    paper with dirty lies about Irishmen at all?”\r\n\r\n    (Enter J.)--“Why don’t you give us more anecdotes and\r\n    sich, Irish stories and them things--I don’t like the long\r\n    speeches--I--”\r\n\r\n    (Devil)--“Copy, sir!”\r\n\r\nThe day after this evidence of unrest appeared the _Sun_ printed,\r\nperhaps with a view to making all manner of citizens gnash their teeth,\r\na few extracts from the narrative of Colonel Hamilton, “the British\r\ntraveler in America”:\r\n\r\n    In America there are no bells and no chambermaids.\r\n\r\n    I have heard, since my arrival in America, the toast of “a\r\n    bloody war in Europe” drank with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n    The whole population of the Southern and Western States are\r\n    uniformly armed with daggers.\r\n\r\n    At present an American might study every book within the limits\r\n    of the Union and still be regarded in many parts of Europe,\r\n    especially in Germany, as a man comparatively ignorant.\r\n\r\nThe editorial suggested that the colonel “had better look wild for the\r\nlake that burns with fire and brimstone.”\r\n\r\nThe union printers were lively even in the first days of the _Sun_,\r\nwhich announced, on October 21, 1833, that the _Journal of Commerce_\r\npaid its journeymen only ten dollars a week, and added:\r\n\r\n    The proprietors of other morning papers cheerfully pay twelve\r\n    dollars. Therefore, the office of the _Journal of Commerce_\r\n    is what printers term a rat office--and the term “rat,” with\r\n    the followers of the same profession with Faust, Franklin, and\r\n    Stanhope, is a most odious term.\r\n\r\nThe “pork-barrel” was foreshadowed in an item printed when the _Sun_\r\nwas just a month old:\r\n\r\n    At the close of the present year the Treasury of the nation\r\n    will contain twelve million dollars. This rich and increasing\r\n    revenue will probably be a bone of contention at the next\r\n    session of Congress.\r\n\r\nAt the end of its first month the _Sun_ was getting more and more\r\nadvertising. Its news was lively enough, considering the times. Rum,\r\nthe cholera in Mexico, assassinations in the South, the police-court,\r\nthe tour of Henry Clay, and poems by Walter Scott were its long suit.\r\nThe circulation of the little paper was now about twelve hundred\r\ncopies, and the future seemed promising, even if Mr. Day did print,\r\nat suspiciously frequent intervals, articles inveighing against the\r\ndebtor’s-prison law.\r\n\r\nThe Astor House--now half a ruin--was at first to be called the Park\r\nHotel, for the _Sun_ of October 29, 1833, announced editorially:\r\n\r\n    THE PARK HOTEL--Mr. W. B. Astor gives notice that he will\r\n    receive proposals for building the long-contemplated hotel in\r\n    Broadway, between Barclay and Vesey Streets.\r\n\r\nAn advertisement which the _Sun_ saw fit to notice editorially\r\nwas inserted by a young man in search of a wife--“a young woman\r\nwho understands the use of the needle, and who is willing to be\r\nindustrious.” The editorial comment was:\r\n\r\n    The advertisement was handed to us by a respectable-looking\r\n    young man, and of course we could not refuse to publish\r\n    it--though if we were in want of a wife we think we should take\r\n    a different course to obtain one.\r\n\r\nSometimes the police items, flecked with poetry, and presumably written\r\nby Wisner, were tantalizingly reticent, as:\r\n\r\n    Maria Jones was accused of stealing clothing, and committed.\r\n    Certain affairs were developed of rather a singular and comical\r\n    nature in relation to her.\r\n\r\nNothing more than that. Perhaps Wisner rather enjoyed being questioned\r\nby admiring friends when he went to dinner at the American House that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBright as the police reporter was, the ship-news man of that day lacked\r\nsnap. The arrival from Europe of James Fenimore Cooper, who could have\r\ntold the _Sun_ more foreign news than it had ever printed, was disposed\r\nof in twelve words. But it must be remembered that the interview was\r\nthen unknown. The only way to get anything out of a citizen was to\r\nenrage him, whereupon he would write a letter. But the _Sun_ did say, a\r\ncouple of days later, that Cooper’s newest novel, “The Headsman,” was\r\nbeing sold in London at seven dollars and fifty cents a copy--no doubt\r\nin the old-fashioned English form, three volumes at half a guinea each.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ blew its own horn for the first time on November 9, 1833:\r\n\r\n    Its success is now beyond question, and it has exceeded\r\n    the most sanguine anticipations of its publishers in its\r\n    circulation and advertising patronage. Scarcely two months\r\n    has it existed in the typographical firmament, and it has a\r\n    daily circulation of upward of two thousand copies, besides\r\n    a steadily increasing advertising patronage. Although of a\r\n    character (we hope) deserving the encouragement of all classes\r\n    of society, it is more especially valuable to those who cannot\r\n    well afford to incur the expense of subscribing to a “blanket\r\n    sheet” and paying ten dollars per annum.\r\n\r\n    In conclusion we may be permitted to remark that the penny\r\n    press, by diffusing useful knowledge among the operative\r\n    classes of society, is effecting the march of intelligence\r\n    to a greater degree than any other mode of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe same article called attention to the fact that the “penny” papers\r\nof England were really two-cent papers. The _Sun’s_ price had been\r\nannounced as “one penny” on the earliest numbers, but on October 8,\r\nwhen it was a little more than a month old, the legend was changed to\r\nread “Price one cent.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _From the Collection of Charles Burnham_\r\n\r\n    BARNEY WILLIAMS, THE COMEDIAN, WHO WAS THE FIRST NEWSBOY OF\r\n    “THE SUN”\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ ran its first serial in the third month of its existence.\r\nThis was “The Life of Davy Crockett,” dictated or authorized by the\r\nfrontiersman himself. It must have been a relief to the readers to get\r\naway from the usual dull reprint from foreign papers that had been\r\nfilling the _Sun’s_ first page. In those days the first pages were\r\nalways the dullest, but Crockett’s lively stories about bear-hunts\r\nenlivened the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nOther celebrities were often mentioned. Aaron Burr, now old and feeble,\r\nwas writing his memoirs. Martin Van Buren had taken lodgings at the\r\nCity Hotel. The Siamese Twins were arrested in the South for beating\r\na man. “Mr. Clay arrived in town last evening and attended the new\r\nopera.” This was “Fra Diavolo,” in which Mr. and Mrs. Wood sang at the\r\nPark Theatre. “It is said that Dom Pedro has dared his brother Miguel\r\nto single combat, which has been refused.” A week later the _Sun_\r\ngloated over the fact that Pedro--Pedro I of Brazil, who was invading\r\nPortugal on behalf of his daughter, Maria da Gloria--had routed the\r\nusurper Miguel’s army.\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 1833, the _Sun_ printed the longest news piece it had\r\never put in type--the message of President Jackson to the Congress.\r\nThis took up three of the four pages, and crowded out nearly all the\r\nadvertising.\r\n\r\nOn December 17, in the fourth month of its life, the _Sun_ announced\r\nthat it had procured “a machine press, on which one thousand\r\nimpressions can be taken in an hour. The daily circulation is now\r\nnearly FOUR THOUSAND.” It was a happy Christmas for Day and Wisner. The\r\n_Sun_ surely was shining!\r\n\r\nThe paper retained its original size and shape during the whole of\r\n1834, and rarely printed more than four pages. As it grew older, it\r\nprinted more and more local items and developed greater interest\r\nin local affairs. The first page was taken up with advertising and\r\nreprint. A State election might have taken place the day before, but on\r\npage 1 the _Sun_ worshippers looked for a bit of fiction or history.\r\nWhat were the fortunes of William L. Marcy as compared to a two-column\r\nthriller, “The Idiot’s Revenge,” or “Captain Chicken and Gentle Sophia”?\r\n\r\nThe head-lines were all small, and most of them italics. Here are\r\nsamples:\r\n\r\n  _INGRATITUDE OF A CAT._\r\n\r\n  _PERSONALITY OF NAPOLEON._\r\n\r\n  _WONDERFUL ANTICS OF FLEAS._\r\n\r\n  _BROUGHT TO IT BY RUM._\r\n\r\nThe news paragraphs were sometimes models of condensation:\r\n\r\n    PICKPOCKETS--On Friday night a Gentleman lost $100 at the Opera\r\n    and then $25 at Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\n    The Hon. Daniel Webster will leave town this morning for\r\n    Washington.\r\n\r\n    John Baker, the person whom we reported a short time since\r\n    as being brought before the police for stealing a ham, died\r\n    suddenly in his cell in Bellevue in the greatest agony--an\r\n    awful warning to drunkards.\r\n\r\n    James G. Bennett has become sole proprietor and editor of the\r\n    Philadelphia _Courier_.\r\n\r\n    Colonel Crockett, it is expected, will visit the Bowery Theater\r\n    this evening.\r\n\r\n    RUMOR--It was rumored in Washington on the 6th that a duel\r\n    would take place the next day between two members of the House.\r\n\r\n    SUDDEN DEATH--Ann McDonough, of Washington Street, attempted to\r\n    drink a pint of rum on a wager, on Wednesday afternoon last.\r\n    Before it was half swallowed Ann was a corpse. Served her right!\r\n\r\n    Bayington, the murderer, we learn by a contemporary, was\r\n    formerly employed in this city on the _Journal of Commerce_. No\r\n    wonder he came to an untimely fate.\r\n\r\n    DUEL--We understand that a duel was fought at Hoboken on\r\n    Friday morning last between a gentleman of Canada and a French\r\n    gentleman of this city, in which the latter was wounded. The\r\n    parties should be arrested.\r\n\r\n    LAMENTABLE DEATH--The camelopard shipped at Calcutta for New\r\n    York died the day after it was embarked. “We could have better\r\n    spared a better” _crittur_, as Shakespeare doesn’t say.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_, although read largely by Jacksonians, did not take the side\r\nof any political party. It favoured national and State economy and city\r\ncleanliness. It dismissed the New York Legislature of 1834 thus:\r\n\r\n    The Legislature of this State closed its arduous duties\r\n    yesterday. It has increased the number of our banks and fixed a\r\n    heavy load of debt upon posterity.\r\n\r\nNothing more. If the readers wanted more they could fly to the ample\r\nbosoms of the sixpennies; but apparently they were satisfied, for\r\nin April of 1834 the _Sun’s_ circulation reached eight thousand, and\r\nColonel Webb, of the _Courier and Enquirer_, was bemoaning the success\r\nof “penny trash.” The _Sun_ replied to him by saying that the public\r\nhad been “imposed upon by ten-dollar trash long enough.” The _Journal\r\nof Commerce_ also slanged the _Sun_, which promptly announced that the\r\n_Journal_ was conducted by “a company of rich, aristocratical men,” and\r\nthat it would take sides with any party to gain a subscriber.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Partner Wisner, the Abolitionist, was evident in many\r\npages of the _Sun_. On June 23, 1834, it printed a piece about Martin\r\nPalmer, who was “pelted down with stones in Wall Street on suspicion of\r\nbeing a runaway slave,” and paid its respects to Boudinot, a Southerner\r\nin New York who was reputed to be a tracker of runaways. It was he who\r\nhad set the crowd after the black:\r\n\r\n    The man who will do this will do anything; he would dance on\r\n    his mother’s grave; he would invade the sacred precincts of the\r\n    tomb and rob a corpse of its winding-sheet; he has no SOUL. It\r\n    is said that this useless fellow is about to commence a suit\r\n    against us for a libel. Try it, Mr. Boudinot!\r\n\r\nDuring the anti-abolition riots of that year the _Sun_ took a firm\r\nstand against the disturbers, although there is little doubt that many\r\nof them were its own readers.\r\n\r\nThe paper made a vigorous little crusade against the evils of the\r\nBridewell in City Hall Park, where dozens of wretches suffered in\r\nthe filth of the debtors’ prison. The _Sun_ was a live wire when the\r\ncholera re-appeared, and it put to rout the sixpenny papers which tried\r\nto make out that the disease was not cholera, but “summer complaint.”\r\nIncidentally, the advertising columns of that day, in nearly all the\r\npapers were filled with patent “cholera cures.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had an eye for urban refinement, too, and begged the\r\naldermen to see to it that pigs were prevented from roaming in City\r\nHall Park. In the matter of silver forks, then a novelty, it was more\r\nconservative, as the following paragraph, printed in November, 1834,\r\nwould indicate:\r\n\r\n    EXTREME NICETY--The author of the “Book of Etiquette,” recently\r\n    printed in London, says: “Silver forks are now common at every\r\n    respectable table, and for my part I cannot see how it is\r\n    possible to eat a dinner comfortably without them.” The booby\r\n    ought to be compelled to cut his beefsteak with a piece of old\r\n    barrel-hoop on a wooden trencher.\r\n\r\nNot even abolition or etiquette, however, could sidetrack the _Sun’s_\r\ninterest in animals. In one issue it dismissed the adjournment of\r\nCongress in three words and, just below, ran this item:\r\n\r\n    THE ANACONDA--Most of those who have seen the beautiful serpent\r\n    at Peale’s Museum will recollect that in the snug quarters\r\n    allotted to him there are two blankets, on one of which he\r\n    lies, and the other is covered over him in cold weather.\r\n    Strange to say that on Monday night, after Mr. Peale had fed\r\n    the serpent with a chicken, according to custom, the serpent\r\n    took it into his head to swallow one of the blankets, which\r\n    is a seven-quarter one, and this blanket he has now in his\r\n    stomach. The proprietor feels much anxiety.\r\n\r\nAlmost every newspaper editor in that era had a theatre feud at one day\r\nor another. The _Sun’s_ quarrel was with Farren, the manager of the\r\nBowery, where Forrest was playing. So the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    DAMN THE YANKEES--We are informed by a correspondent (though we\r\n    have not seen the announcement ourselves) that Farren, the chap\r\n    who damned the Yankees so lustily the other day, and who is now\r\n    under bonds for a gross outrage on a respectable butcher near\r\n    the Bowery Theater, is intending to make his appearance on the\r\n    Bowery stage THIS EVENING!\r\n\r\nFive hundred citizens gathered at the theatre that night, waited until\r\nnine o’clock, and then charged through the doors, breaking up the\r\nperformance of “Metamora.” The _Sun_ described it:\r\n\r\nThe supernumeraries scud from behind the scenes like quails--the\r\nstock actors’ teeth chattered--_Oceana_ looked imploringly at the\r\ngood-for-nothing Yankees--_Nahmeeoke_ trembled--_Guy of Godalwin_\r\nturned on his heel, and _Metamora_ coolly shouldered his tomahawk and\r\nwalked off the stage.\r\n\r\nThe management announced that Farren was discharged. The mayor of New\r\nYork and Edwin Forrest made conciliatory speeches, and the crowd went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe attacks of Colonel Stone, editor of the six-cent _Commercial_,\r\naroused the _Sun_ to retaliate in kind. A column about the colonel\r\nended thus:\r\n\r\n    He was then again cowskinned by Mr. Bryant of the _Post_, and\r\n    was most unpoetically flogged near the American Hotel. He has\r\n    always been the slave of avarice, cowardice, and meanness....\r\n    The next time he sees fit to attack the penny press we hope he\r\n    will confine himself to facts.\r\n\r\nA month later the _Sun_ went after Colonel Stone again:\r\n\r\n    The colonel ... for the sake of an additional glass of wine\r\n    and a couple of real Spanish cigars, did actually perpetrate\r\n    a most excellent and true article, the first we have seen of\r\n    his for a long time past. Now we have serious thoughts that\r\n    the colonel will yet become quite a decent fellow, and may\r\n    ultimately ascend, after a long course of training, to a level\r\n    with the penny dailies which have soared so far above him in\r\n    the heavens of veracity.\r\n\r\nIt must be said of Colonel Stone that he was a man of literary and\r\npolitical attainments. He was editor of the _Commercial Advertiser_ for\r\nmore than twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe colonel did not reform to the _Sun’s_ liking at once, but the feud\r\nlessened, and presently it was the _Transcript_--a penny paper which\r\nsprang up when the _Sun’s_ success was assured--to which the _Sun_ took\r\nits biggest cudgels. One of the _Transcript’s_ editors, it said, had\r\npassed a bogus three-dollar bill on the Bank of Troy. Another walked\r\n“on both sides of the street, like a twopenny postman,” while a third\r\n“spent his money at a theatre with females,” while his family was in\r\nwant. But, added the _Sun_, “we never let personalities creep in.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _Times_--not the present _Times_--had also started up, and\r\nit dared to boast of a circulation “greater than any in the city except\r\nthe _Courier_.” Said the _Sun_:\r\n\r\n    If the daily circulation of the _Sun_ be not larger than that\r\n    of the _Times_ and _Courier_ both, then may we be hung up by\r\n    the ears and flogged to death with a rattle-snake’s skin.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ took no risk in this. By November of 1834 its circulation was\r\nabove ten thousand. On December 3 it published the President’s message\r\nin full and circulated fifteen thousand copies. At the beginning of\r\n1835 it announced a new press--a Napier, built by R. Hoe & Co.--new\r\ntype, and a bigger paper, circulating twenty thousand. The print paper\r\nwas to cost four-fifths of a cent a copy, but the _Sun_ was getting\r\nlots of advertising. With the increase in size, that New Year’s Day,\r\nthe _Sun_ adopted the motto, “It Shines for All.” which it is still\r\nusing to-day. This motto doubtless was suggested by the sign of the\r\nfamous Rising Sun Tavern, or Howard’s Inn, which then stood at the\r\njunction of Bedford and Jamaica turnpikes, in East New York. The sign,\r\nwhich was in front of the tavern as early as 1776, was supported on\r\nposts near the road and bore a rude picture of a rising sun and the\r\nmotto which Day adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the same month--January, 1835--the bigger and better _Sun_ printed\r\nits first real sports story. The sporting editor, who very likely was\r\nalso the police reporter and perhaps Partner Wisner as well, heard that\r\nthere was to be a fight in the fields near Hoboken between Williamson,\r\nof Philadelphia, and Phelan, of New York. He crossed the ferry, hired\r\na saddle-horse in Hoboken, and galloped to the ringside. It was bare\r\nknuckles, London rules, and only thirty seconds’ interval between\r\nrounds:\r\n\r\n    At the end of three minutes Williamson fell. (Cheers and cries\r\n    of “Fair Play!”) After breathing half a minute, they went at it\r\n    again, and Phelan was knocked down. (Cheers and cries of “Give\r\n    it to him!”) In three minutes more Williamson fell, and the\r\n    adjoining woods echoed back the shouts of the spectators.\r\n\r\nThe match lasted seventy-two minutes and ended in the defeat of\r\nWilliamson. The _Sun’s_ report contained no sporting slang, and the\r\nreporter did not seem to like pugilism:\r\n\r\n    And this is what is called “sports of the ring!” We can\r\n    cheerfully encourage foot-races or any other humane and\r\n    reasonable amusement, but the Lord deliver us from the “ring.”\r\n\r\nThe following day the _Sun_ denounced prize-fighting as “a European\r\npractice, better fitted for the morally and physically oppressed\r\nclasses of London than the enlightened republican citizens of New York.”\r\n\r\nAs prosperity came, the news columns improved. The sensational was not\r\nthe only pabulum fed to the reader. Beside the story of a duel between\r\ntwo midshipmen he would find a review of the Burr autobiography, just\r\nout. Gossip about Fanny Kemble’s quarrel with her father--the _Sun_\r\nwas vexed with the actress because she said that New York audiences\r\nwere made up of butchers--would appear next to a staid report of the\r\ndoings of Congress. The attacks on Rum continued, and the _Sun_ was\r\nquick to oppose the proposed “licensing of houses of prostitution and\r\nbilliard-rooms.”\r\n\r\nThe success of Mr. Day’s paper was so great that every printer and\r\nnewspaperman in New York longed to run a penny journal. On June 22,\r\n1835, the paper’s name appeared at the head of the editorial column on\r\nPage 2 as _The True Sun_, although on the first page the bold head-line\r\n_THE SUN_, remained as usual. An editorial note said:\r\n\r\n    We have changed our inside head to _True Sun_ for reasons which\r\n    will hereafter be made known.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the _True Sun_ title was entirely missing, and its\r\nabsence was explained in an editorial article as follows:\r\n\r\n    Having understood on Wednesday (June 21) that a daily paper\r\n    was about being issued in this city as nearly like our own as\r\n    it could be got up, under the title of _The True Sun_, for the\r\n    avowed purpose of benefitting the proprietors at our expense,\r\n    we yesterday changed our inside title, being determined to\r\n    place an injunction upon any such piratical proceedings.\r\n    Yesterday morning the anticipated _Sun_ made its appearance,\r\n    and at first sight we immediately abandoned our intention of\r\n    defending ourselves legally, being convinced that it is a\r\n    mere catchpenny second-hand concern which (had it our whole\r\n    list and patronage) would in one month be among the “Things\r\n    that were.” It is published by William F. Short and edited\r\n    by Stephen B. Butler, who announces that his “politics are\r\n    Whig.”... Mr. Short, with the ingenuity of a London pickpocket,\r\n    though without the honesty, has made up his paper as nearly\r\n    like ours as was possible and given it the name of _The (true)\r\n    Sun_ for the purpose of imposing on the public.... We hereby\r\n    publish William F. Short and Stephen B. Butler to our editorial\r\n    brethren and to the printing profession in general as _Literary\r\n    Scoundrels_.\r\n\r\nA day later (June 24, 1835) the _Sun_ declared that in establishing\r\nthe _True Sun_ “Short, who is one of the printers of the _Messenger_,\r\nactually purloined the composition of his reading matter”; and it\r\nprinted a letter from William Burnett, publisher of the _Weekly\r\nMessenger_, to support its charge of larceny.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, six days after the _True Sun’s_ first appearance, the _Sun_\r\nannounced the failure of the pretender. The _True Sun’s_ proprietors,\r\nit said, “have concluded to abandon their piratical course.”\r\n\r\nAnother _True Sun_ was issued by Benjamin H. Day in 1840, two years\r\nafter he sold the _Sun_ to Moses Y. Beach. A third _True Sun_,\r\nestablished by former employees of the _Sun_ on March 20, 1843, ran for\r\nmore than a year. A daily called the _Citizen and True Sun_, started in\r\n1845, had a short life.\r\n\r\nWhen a contemporary did not fail the _Sun_ poked fun at it:\r\n\r\n    MAJOR NOAH’S SINGULARITY--The _Evening Star_ of yesterday comes\r\n    out in favor of the French, lottery, gambling, and phrenology\r\n    for ladies. Is the man crazy?\r\n\r\nThe editor whose sanity was questioned was the famous Mordecai Manuel\r\nNoah, one of the most versatile men of his time. He was a newspaper\r\ncorrespondent at fifteen. When he was twenty-eight, President Madison\r\nappointed him to be consul-general at Tunis, where he distinguished\r\nhimself by his rescue of several Americans who were held as slaves\r\nin the Barbary States. On his return to New York, in 1816, he again\r\nentered journalism, and was successively connected with the _National\r\nAdvocate_, the _Enquirer_, the _Commercial Advertiser_, the _Times and\r\nMessenger_, and the _Evening Star_. In 1825 he attempted to establish a\r\ngreat Jewish colony on Grand Island, in the Niagara River, but he found\r\nneither sympathy nor aid among his coreligionists, and the scheme was a\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nNoah wrote a dozen dramas, all of which have been forgotten, although\r\nhe was the most popular playwright in America at that day. His _Evening\r\nStar_ was a good paper, and the _Sun’s_ quarrels with it were not\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nFor their attacks on Attree, the editor of the _Transcript_, Messrs.\r\nDay and Wisner got themselves indicted for criminal libel. They took it\r\ncalmly:\r\n\r\n    Bigger men than we have passed through that ordeal. There is\r\n    Major Noah, the Grand Mogul of the editorial tribe, who has not\r\n    only been indicted, but, we believe, placed at the bar. Then\r\n    there’s Colonel Webb; no longer ago than last autumn he was\r\n    indicted by the grand jury of Delaware County. The colonel, it\r\n    is said, didn’t consider this a fair business transaction,\r\n    and, brushing up the mahogany pistol, he took his coach and\r\n    hounds, drove up to good old Delaware, and bid defiance to\r\n    the whole posse comitatus of the county. The greatest men in\r\n    the country have some time in the course of their lives been\r\n    indicted.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, when Attree, who had left the _Transcript_ to write\r\n“horribles” for the _Courier_, was terribly beaten in the street, the\r\n_Sun_ denounced the assault and tried to expose the assailants.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1835, a few days after the indictment of the partners,\r\nMr. Wisner was challenged to a duel by a quack dentist whose medicines\r\nthe _Sun_ had exposed. The _Sun_ announced editorially that Wisner\r\naccepted the challenge, and that, having the choice of weapons, he\r\nchose syringes charged with the dentist’s own medicine, the distance\r\nfive paces. No duel!\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the _Sun_ owners sought a challenge from the fiery\r\nJames Watson Webb of the mahogany pistol, for they made many a dig at\r\nhis sixpenny paper. Here is a sample:\r\n\r\n    OUTRAGEOUS--The _Courier and Enquirer_ of Saturday morning is\r\n    just twice as large as its usual size. The sheet is now large\r\n    enough for a blanket and two pairs of pillow-cases, and it\r\n    contains, in printers’ language, 698,300 ems--equal to eight\r\n    volumes of the ordinary-sized novels of the present day. If\r\n    the reading matter were printed in pica type and put in one\r\n    unbroken line, it would reach from Nova Zembla to Terra del\r\n    Fuego. Such a paper is an insult to a civilized community.\r\n\r\nA little later, when Colonel Webb’s paper boasted of “the largest\r\ncirculation,” the _Sun_ offered to bet the colonel a thousand\r\ndollars--the money to go to the Washington Monument Association--that\r\nthe _Sun_ had a circulation twice as great as that of the big sixpenny\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that the _Sun_ did not attempt to\r\ntreat the serious matters of the day. It handled them very well,\r\nconsidering the lack of facilities. The war crisis with France, happily\r\ndispelled; the amazing project of the Erie Railroad to build a line as\r\nfar west as Chautauqua County, New York; the anti-abolitionist riots\r\nand the little religious rows; the ambitions of Daniel Webster and the\r\napproach of Halley’s comet--all these had their half-column or so.\r\n\r\nWhen Matthias the Prophet, the Dowie of that day, was brought to trial\r\nin White Plains, Westchester County, on a charge of having poisoned\r\na Mr. Elijah Pierson, the _Sun_ sent a reporter to that then distant\r\ncourt. It is possible that this reporter was Benjamin H. Day himself.\r\nAt any rate, Day attended the trial, and there made the acquaintance\r\nof a man who that very summer made the _Sun_ the talk of the world and\r\nbrought to the young paper the largest circulation of any daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRICHARD ADAMS LOCKE’S MOON HOAX\r\n\r\n  _A Magnificent Fake Which Deceived Two Continents, Brought to “The\r\n    Sun” the Largest Circulation in the World and, in Poe’s Opinion,\r\n    Established Penny Papers._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man whom Day met at the murder trial in White Plains was Richard\r\nAdams Locke, a reporter who was destined to kick up more dust than\r\nperhaps any other man of his profession. As he comes on the stage, we\r\nmust let his predecessor, George W. Wisner, pass into the wings.\r\n\r\nWisner was a good man, as a reporter, as a writer of editorial\r\narticles, and as part owner of the paper. His campaign for Abolition\r\nirritated Mr. Day at first, but the young man’s motives were so pure\r\nand his articles so logical that Day recognized the justice of the\r\ncause, even as he realized the foolish methods employed by some of the\r\nAbolitionists. Wisner set the face of the _Sun_ against slavery, and\r\nDay kept it so, but there were minor matters of policy upon which the\r\npartners never agreed, never could agree.\r\n\r\nWhen Wisner’s health became poor, in the summer of 1835, he expressed\r\na desire to get away from New York. Mr. Day paid him five thousand\r\ndollars for his interest in the paper--a large sum in those days,\r\nconsidering the fact that Wisner had won his share with no capital\r\nexcept his pen. Wisner went West and settled at Pontiac, Michigan.\r\nThere his health improved, his fortune increased, and he was at one\r\ntime a member of the Michigan Legislature.\r\n\r\nWhen Day found that Locke was the best reporter attending the trial of\r\nMatthias the Prophet, he hired him to write a series of articles on the\r\nreligious fakir. These, the first “feature stories” that ever appeared\r\nin the _Sun_, were printed on the front page.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, while the Matthias articles were still being sold\r\non the streets in pamphlet form, Locke went to Day and told him that\r\nhis boss, Colonel Webb of the _Courier and Enquirer_, had discharged\r\nhim for working for the _Sun_ “on the side.” Wisner was about to leave\r\nthe paper, and Day was glad to hire Locke, for he needed an editorial\r\nwriter. Twelve dollars a week was the alluring wage, and Locke accepted\r\nit.\r\n\r\nLocke was then thirty-five--ten years senior to his employer. Let his\r\ncontemporary, Edgar Allan Poe, describe him:\r\n\r\n    He is about five feet seven inches in height, symmetrically\r\n    formed; there is an air of distinction about his whole\r\n    person--the _air noble_ of genius. His face is strongly pitted\r\n    by the smallpox, and, perhaps from the same cause, there\r\n    is a marked obliquity in the eyes; a certain calm, clear\r\n    _luminousness_, however, about these latter amply compensates\r\n    for the defect, and the forehead is truly beautiful in its\r\n    intellectuality. I am acquainted with no person possessing so\r\n    fine a forehead as Mr. Locke.\r\n\r\nLocke was nine years older than Poe, who at this time had most of his\r\nfame ahead of him. Poe was quick to recognize the quality of Locke’s\r\nwritings; indeed, the poet saw, perhaps more clearly than others of\r\nthat period, that America was full of good writers--a fact of which\r\nthe general public was neglectful. This was Poe’s tribute to Locke’s\r\nliterary gift:\r\n\r\n    His prose style is noticeable for its concision, luminosity,\r\n    completeness--each quality in its proper place. He has that\r\n    _method_ so generally characteristic of genius proper.\r\n    Everything he writes is a model in its peculiar way, serving\r\n    just the purposes intended and nothing to spare.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ new writer was a collateral descendant of John Locke, the\r\nEnglish philosopher of the seventeenth century. He was born in 1800,\r\nbut his birthplace was not New York, as his contemporary biographers\r\nwrote. It was East Brent, Somersetshire, England. His early American\r\nfriends concealed this fact when writing of Locke, for they feared that\r\nhis English birth (all the wounds of war had not healed) would keep him\r\nout of some of the literary clubs. He was educated by his mother and\r\nby private tutors until he was nineteen, when he entered Cambridge.\r\nWhile still a student he contributed to the _Bee_, the _Imperial\r\nMagazine_, and other English publications. When he left Cambridge he\r\nhad the hardihood to start the London _Republican_, the title of which\r\ndescribes its purpose. This was a failure, for London declined to warm\r\nto the theories of American democracy, no matter how scholarly their\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nAbandoning the _Republican_, young Locke devoted himself to literature\r\nand science. He ran a periodical called the _Cornucopia_ for about six\r\nmonths, but it was not a financial success, and in 1832, with his wife\r\nand infant daughter, he went to New York. Colonel Webb put him at work\r\non his paper.\r\n\r\nLocke could write almost anything. In Cambridge and in Fleet Street he\r\nhad picked up a wonderful store of general information. He could turn\r\nout prose or poetry, politics or pathos, anecdotes or astronomy.\r\n\r\nWhile he lived in London, Locke was a regular reader of the Edinburgh\r\n_New Philosophical Journal_, and he brought some copies of it to\r\nAmerica. One of these, an issue of 1826, contained an article by Dr.\r\nThomas Dick, of Dundee, a pious man, but inclined to speculate on the\r\npossibilities of the universe. In this article Dr. Dick suggested the\r\nfeasibility of communicating with the moon by means of great stone\r\nsymbols on the face of the earth. The people of the moon--if there\r\nwere any--would fathom the diagrams and reply in a similar way. Dr.\r\nDick explained afterward that he wrote this piece with the idea of\r\nsatirizing a certain coterie of eccentric German astronomers.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that Sir John Frederick William Herschel, the greatest\r\nastronomer of his time, and the son of the celebrated astronomer\r\nSir William Herschel, went to South Africa in January, 1834, and\r\nestablished an observatory at Feldhausen, near Cape Town, with the\r\nintention of completing his survey of the sidereal heavens by examining\r\nthe southern skies as he had swept the northern, thus to make the first\r\ntelescopic survey of the whole surface of the visible heavens.\r\n\r\nLocke knew about Sir John and his mission. The Matthias case had blown\r\nover, the big fire in Fulton Street was almost forgotten, and things\r\nwere a bit dull on the island of Manhattan. The newspapers were in a\r\nstate of armed truce. As Locke and his fellow journalists gathered at\r\nthe American Hotel bar for their after-dinner brandy, it is probable\r\nthat there was nothing, not even the great sloth recently arrived at\r\nthe American Museum, to excite a good argument.\r\n\r\nLocke needed money, for his salary of twelve dollars a week could ill\r\nsupport the fine gentleman that he was; so he laid a plan before Mr.\r\nDay. It was a plot as well as a plan, and the first angle of the plot\r\nappeared on the second page of the _Sun_ on August 21, 1835:\r\n\r\n    CELESTIAL DISCOVERIES--The Edinburgh _Courant_ says--“We\r\n    have just learnt from an eminent publisher in this city that\r\n    Sir John Herschel, at the Cape of Good Hope, has made some\r\n    astronomical discoveries of the most wonderful description, by\r\n    means of an immense telescope of an entirely new principle.”\r\n\r\nNothing further appeared until Tuesday, August 25, when three columns\r\nof the _Sun’s_ first page took the newspaper and scientific worlds by\r\nthe ears. Those were not the days of big type. The _Sun’s_ heading read:\r\n\r\n  GREAT ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES.\r\n\r\n  LATELY MADE\r\n  BY SIR JOHN HERSCHEL, LL.D., F.R.S., &c.\r\n\r\n  At the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n  [_From Supplement to the Edinburgh Journal of Science._]\r\n\r\nIt may as well be said here that although there had been an Edinburgh\r\n_Journal of Science_, it ceased to exist several years before 1835. The\r\nperiodical to which Dr. Dick, of Dundee, contributed his moon theories\r\nwas, in a way, the successor to the _Journal of Science_, but it was\r\ncalled the _New Philosophical Journal_. The likeness of names was not\r\ngreat, but enough to cause some confusion. It is also noteworthy that\r\nthe sly Locke credited to a supplement, rather than to the _Journal of\r\nScience_ itself, the revelations which he that day began to pour before\r\nthe eyes of _Sun_ readers. Thus he started:\r\n\r\n    In this unusual addition to our _Journal_ we have the happiness\r\n    of making known to the British public, and thence to the whole\r\n    civilized world, recent discoveries in astronomy which will\r\n    build an imperishable monument to the age in which we live, and\r\n    confer upon the present generation of the human race proud\r\n    distinction through all future time. It has been poetically\r\n    said that the stars of heaven are the hereditary regalia of man\r\n    as the intellectual sovereign of the animal creation. He may\r\n    now fold the zodiac around him with a loftier consciousness of\r\n    his mental supremacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHARD ADAMS LOCKE, AUTHOR OF THE MOON HOAX\r\n    From an Engraving in the Possession of His Granddaughter, Mrs.\r\n    F. Winthrop White of New Brighton, S. I.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter solemnly dwelling on the awe which mortal man must feel upon\r\npeering into the secrets of the sky, the article declared that Sir John\r\n“paused several hours before he commenced his observations, that he\r\nmight prepare his own mind for discoveries which he knew would fill the\r\nminds of myriads of his fellow men with astonishment.” It continued:\r\n\r\n    And well might he pause! From the hour the first human pair\r\n    opened their eyes to the glories of the blue firmament above\r\n    them, there has been no accession to human knowledge at all\r\n    comparable in sublime interest to that which he has been the\r\n    honored agent in supplying. Well might he pause! He was about\r\n    to become the sole depository of wondrous secrets which had\r\n    been hid from the eyes of all men that had lived since the\r\n    birth of time.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a half-column of glorification, the writer got down to\r\nbrass tacks:\r\n\r\n    To render our enthusiasm intelligible, we will state at\r\n    once that by means of a telescope, of vast dimensions and\r\n    an entirely new principle, the younger Herschel, at his\r\n    observatory in the southern hemisphere, has already made the\r\n    most extraordinary discoveries in every planet of our solar\r\n    system; has discovered planets in other solar systems; has\r\n    obtained a distinct view of objects in the moon, fully equal to\r\n    that which the unaided eye commands of terrestrial objects at\r\n    the distance of one hundred yards; has affirmatively settled\r\n    the question whether this satellite be inhabited, and by what\r\n    orders of beings; has firmly established a new theory of\r\n    cometary phenomena; and has solved or corrected nearly every\r\n    leading problem of mathematical astronomy.\r\n\r\nAnd where was the _Journal of Science_ getting this mine of\r\nastronomical revelation for its supplement? The mystery is explained at\r\nonce:\r\n\r\n    We are indebted to the devoted friendship of Dr. Andrew\r\n    Grant, the pupil of the elder, and for several years past the\r\n    inseparable coadjutor of the younger Herschel. The amanuensis\r\n    of the latter at the Cape of Good Hope, and the indefatigable\r\n    superintendent of his telescope during the whole period of\r\n    its construction and operations, Dr. Grant has been able to\r\n    supply us with intelligence equal in general interest at\r\n    least to that which Dr. Herschel himself has transmitted to\r\n    the Royal Society. For permission to indulge his friendship\r\n    in communicating this invaluable information to us, Dr. Grant\r\n    and ourselves are indebted to the magnanimity of Dr. Herschel,\r\n    who, far above all mercenary considerations, has thus signally\r\n    honored and rewarded his fellow laborer in the field of science.\r\n\r\nRegarding the illustrations which, according to the implications of\r\nthe text, accompanied the supplement, the writer was specific. Most\r\nof them, he stated, were copies of “drawings taken in the observatory\r\nby Herbert Home, Esq., who accompanied the last powerful series of\r\nreflectors from London to the Cape. The engraving of the belts of\r\nJupiter is a reduced copy of an imperial folio drawing by Dr. Herschel\r\nhimself. The segment of the inner ring of Saturn is from a large\r\ndrawing by Dr. Grant.”\r\n\r\nA history of Sir William Herschel’s work and a description of his\r\ntelescopes took up a column of the _Sun_, and on top of this came the\r\ndetails--as the _Journal_ printed them--of Sir John’s plans to outdo\r\nhis father by revolutionary methods and a greater telescope. Sir John,\r\nit appeared, was in conference with Sir David Brewster:\r\n\r\n    After a few minutes’ silent thought, Sir John diffidently\r\n    inquired whether it would not be possible to effect a\r\n    _transfusion of artificial light through the focal object of\r\n    vision!_ Sir David, somewhat startled at the originality of the\r\n    idea, paused a while, and then hesitatingly referred to the\r\n    refrangibility of rays and the angle of incidence. Sir John,\r\n    grown more confident, adduced the example of the Newtonian\r\n    reflector, in which the refrangibility was corrected by the\r\n    second speculum and the angle of incidence restored by the\r\n    third.\r\n\r\n    “And,” continued he, “why cannot the illuminated microscope,\r\n    say the hydro-oxygen, be applied to render distinct and, if\r\n    necessary, even to magnify, the focal object?”\r\n\r\n    Sir David sprang from his chair in an ecstasy of conviction,\r\n    and, leaping half-way to the ceiling, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n    “Thou art the man!”\r\n\r\nDetails of the casting of a great lens came next. It was twenty-four\r\nfeet in diameter, and weighed nearly fifteen thousand pounds after it\r\nwas polished; its estimated magnifying-power was forty-two thousand\r\ntimes. As he saw it safely started on its way to Africa, Sir John\r\n“expressed confidence in his ultimate ability to study even the\r\nentomology of the moon, in case she contained insects upon her surface.”\r\n\r\nThus ended the first instalment of the story. Where had the _Sun_ got\r\nthe _Journal of Science_ supplement? An editorial article answered that\r\n“it was very politely furnished us by a medical gentleman immediately\r\nfrom Scotland, in consequence of a paragraph which appeared on Friday\r\nlast from the Edinburgh _Courant_.” The article added:\r\n\r\n    The portion which we publish to-day is introductory to\r\n    celestial discoveries of higher and more universal interest\r\n    than any, in any science yet known to the human race. Now\r\n    indeed it may be said that we live in an age of discovery.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that the whole town buzzed with excitement that day.\r\nPerhaps this first instalment was a bit over the heads of most readers;\r\nit was so technical, so foreign. But in Nassau and Ann Streets,\r\nwherever two newspapermen were gathered together, there was buzzing\r\nenough. What was coming next? Why hadn’t they thought to subscribe to\r\nthe Edinburgh _Journal of Science_, with its wonderful supplement?\r\n\r\nNearly four columns of the revelations appeared on the following\r\nday--August 26, 1835. This time the reading public came trooping into\r\ncamp, for the _Sun’s_ reprint of the _Journal of Science_ supplement\r\ngot beyond the stage of preliminaries and predictions, and began to\r\ntell of what was to be seen on the moon. Scientists and newspapermen\r\nappreciated the detailed description of the mammoth telescope and the\r\nwork of placing it, but the public, like a child, wanted the moon--and\r\ngot it. Let us plunge in at about the point where the public plunged:\r\n\r\n    The specimen of lunar vegetation, however, which they had\r\n    already seen, had decided a question of too exciting an\r\n    interest to induce them to retard its exit. It had demonstrated\r\n    that the moon has an atmosphere constituted similarly to our\r\n    own, and capable of sustaining organized and, therefore, most\r\n    probably, animal life.\r\n\r\n    “The trees,” says Dr. Grant, “for a period of ten minutes were\r\n    of one unvaried kind, and unlike any I have seen except the\r\n    largest class of yews in the English churchyards, which they in\r\n    some respects resemble. These were followed by a level green\r\n    plain which, as measured by the painted circle on our canvas\r\n    of forty-nine feet, must have been more than half a mile in\r\n    breadth.”\r\n\r\nThe article had explained that, by means of a great reflector, the\r\nlunar views were thrown upon a big canvas screen behind the telescope.\r\n\r\n    Then appeared as fine a forest of firs, unequivocal firs, as I\r\n    have ever seen cherished in the bosom of my native mountains.\r\n    Wearied with the long continuance of these, we greatly reduced\r\n    the magnifying power of the microscope without eclipsing either\r\n    of the reflectors, and immediately perceived that we had been\r\n    insensibly descending, as it were, a mountainous district of\r\n    highly diversified and romantic character, and that we were\r\n    on the verge of a lake, or inland sea; but of what relative\r\n    locality or extent, we were yet too greatly magnified to\r\n    determine.\r\n\r\n    On introducing the feeblest achromatic lens we possessed, we\r\n    found that the water, whose boundary we had just discovered,\r\n    answered in general outline to the Mare Nubicum of Riccoli.\r\n    Fairer shores never angel coasted on a tour of pleasure. A\r\n    beach of brilliant white sand, girt with wild, castellated\r\n    rocks, apparently of green marble, varied at chasms, occurring\r\n    every two or three hundred feet, with grotesque blocks of chalk\r\n    or gypsum, and feathered and festooned at the summits with the\r\n    clustering foliage of unknown trees, moved along the bright\r\n    wall of our apartment until we were speechless with admiration.\r\n\r\nA column farther on, in a wonderful valley of this wonderful moon, life\r\nat last burst upon the seers:\r\n\r\n    In the shade of the woods on the southeastern side we beheld\r\n    continuous herds of brown quadrupeds, having all the external\r\n    characteristics of the bison, but more diminutive than any\r\n    species of the _bos_ genus in our natural history. Its tail\r\n    was like that of our _bos grunniens_; but in its semicircular\r\n    horns, the hump on its shoulders, the depth of its dewlap,\r\n    and the length of its shaggy hair, it closely resembled the\r\n    species to which I have compared it.\r\n\r\n    It had, however, one widely distinctive feature, which we\r\n    afterward found common to nearly every lunar quadruped we have\r\n    discovered; namely, a remarkable fleshy appendage over the\r\n    eyes, crossing the whole breadth of the forehead and united to\r\n    the ears. We could most distinctly perceive this hairy veil,\r\n    which was shaped like the upper front outline of the cap known\r\n    to the ladies as Mary Queen of Scots cap, lifted and lowered by\r\n    means of the ears. It immediately occurred to the acute mind\r\n    of Dr. Herschel that this was a providential contrivance to\r\n    protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light\r\n    and darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the\r\n    moon are periodically subjected.\r\n\r\n    The next animal perceived would be classed on earth as a\r\n    monster. It was of a bluish lead color, about the size\r\n    of a goat, with a head and beard like him, and a _single\r\n    horn_, slightly inclined forward from the perpendicular. The\r\n    female was destitute of the horn and beard, but had a much\r\n    longer tail. It was gregarious, and chiefly abounded on the\r\n    acclivitous glades of the woods. In elegance of symmetry\r\n    it rivaled the antelope, and like him it seemed an agile,\r\n    sprightly creature, running with great speed and springing from\r\n    the green turf with all the unaccountable antics of the young\r\n    lamb or kitten.\r\n\r\n    This beautiful creature afforded us the most exquisite\r\n    amusement. The mimicry of its movements upon our white-painted\r\n    canvas was as faithful and luminous as that of animals within\r\n    a few yards of a camera obscura when seen pictured upon its\r\n    tympan. Frequently, when attempting to put our fingers upon\r\n    its beard, it would suddenly bound away into oblivion, as if\r\n    conscious of our earthly impertinence; but then others would\r\n    appear, whom we could not prevent nibbling the herbage, say or\r\n    do what we would to them.\r\n\r\nSo, at last, the people of earth knew something concrete about the live\r\nthings of the moon. Goats with beards were there, and every New Yorker\r\nknew goats, for they fed upon the rocky hills of Harlem. And the moon\r\nhad birds, too:\r\n\r\n    On examining the center of this delightful valley we found\r\n    a large, branching river, abounding with lovely islands and\r\n    water-birds of numerous kinds. A species of gray pelican\r\n    was the most numerous, but black and white cranes, with\r\n    unreasonably long legs and bill, were also quite common. We\r\n    watched their piscivorous experiments a long time in hopes\r\n    of catching sight of a lunar fish; but, although we were not\r\n    gratified in this respect, we could easily guess the purpose\r\n    with which they plunged their long necks so deeply beneath\r\n    the water. Near the upper extremity of one of these islands\r\n    we obtained a glimpse of a strange amphibious creature of a\r\n    spherical form, which rolled with great velocity across the\r\n    pebbly beach, and was lost sight of in the strong current which\r\n    set off from this angle of the island.\r\n\r\nAt this point clouds intervened, and the Herschel party had to call\r\nit a day. But it had been a big day, and nobody who read the _Sun_\r\nwondered that the astronomers tossed off “congratulatory bumpers of\r\nthe best ‘East India particular,’ and named this place of wonders the\r\nValley of the Unicorn.” So ended the _Sun_ story of August 26, but an\r\neditorial paragraph assured the patrons of the paper that on the morrow\r\nthere would be a treat even richer.\r\n\r\nWhat did the other papers say? In the language of a later and less\r\nelegant period, most of them ate it up--some eagerly, some grudgingly,\r\nsome a bit dubiously, but they ate it, either in crumbs or in hunks.\r\nThe _Daily Advertiser_ declared:\r\n\r\n    No article has appeared for years that will command so general\r\n    a perusal and publication. Sir John has added a stock of\r\n    knowledge to the present age that will immortalize his name and\r\n    place it high on the page of science.\r\n\r\nThe _Mercantile Advertiser_, knowing that its lofty readers were\r\nunlikely to see the moon revelations in the lowly _Sun_, hastened\r\nto begin reprinting the articles in full, with the remark that the\r\ndocument appeared to have intrinsic evidence of authenticity.\r\n\r\nThe _Times_, a daily then only a year old, and destined to live only\r\neighteen months more--later, of course, the title was used by a\r\nsuccessful daily--said that everything in the _Sun_ story was probable\r\nand plausible, and had an “air of intense verisimilitude.”\r\n\r\nThe New York _Sunday News_ advised the incredulous to be patient:\r\n\r\n    Our doubts and incredulity may be a wrong to the learned\r\n    astronomer, and the circumstances of this wonderful discovery\r\n    may be correct.\r\n\r\nThe _Courier and Enquirer_ said nothing at all. Like the _Journal\r\nof Commerce_, it hated the _Sun_ for a lucky upstart. Both of these\r\nsixpenny respectables stood silent, with their axes behind their backs.\r\nTheir own readers, the Livingstons and the Stuyvesants, got not a\r\nline about the moon from the blanket sheets, but they sent down into\r\nthe kitchen and borrowed the _Sun_ from the domestics, on the shallow\r\npretext of wishing to discover whether their employees were reading a\r\nmoral newspaper--as indeed they were.\r\n\r\nThe _Herald_, then about four months old, said not a word about the\r\nmoon story. In fact, that was a period in which it said nothing at all\r\nabout any subject, for the fire of that summer had unfortunately wiped\r\nout its plant. On the very days when the moon stories appeared, Mr.\r\nBennett stood cracking his knuckles in front of his new establishment,\r\nthe basement of 202 Broadway, trying to hurry the men who were\r\ninstalling a double-cylinder press. Being a wise person, he advertised\r\nhis progress in the _Sun_. It may have vexed him to see the circulation\r\nof the _Sun_--which he had imitated in character and price--bound\r\nhigher and higher as he stood helpless.\r\n\r\nThe third instalment of the literary treasure so obligingly imported by\r\nthe “medical gentleman immediately from Scotland” introduced to _Sun_\r\nreaders new and important regions of the moon--the Vagabond Mountains,\r\nthe Lake of Death, craters of extinct volcanoes twenty-eight hundred\r\nfeet high, and twelve luxuriant forests divided by open plains “in\r\nwhich waved an ocean of verdure, and which were probably prairies like\r\nthose of North America.” The details were satisfying:\r\n\r\n    Dr. Herschel has classified not less than thirty-eight species\r\n    of forest trees and nearly twice this number of plants, found\r\n    in this tract alone, which are widely different to those found\r\n    in more equatorial latitudes. Of animals he classified nine\r\n    species of mammalia and five of oviparia. Among the former is\r\n    a small kind of reindeer, the elk, the moose, the horned bear,\r\n    and the biped beaver.\r\n\r\n    The last resembles the beaver of the earth in every other\r\n    respect than its destitution of a tail and its invariable\r\n    habit of walking upon only two feet. It carries its young in\r\n    its arms, like a human being, and walks with an easy, gliding\r\n    motion. Its huts are constructed better and higher than those\r\n    of many tribes of human savages, and from the appearance of\r\n    smoke in nearly all of them there is no doubt of its being\r\n    acquainted with the use of fire.\r\n\r\nThe largest lake described was two hundred and sixty-six miles long and\r\none hundred and ninety-three wide, shaped like the Bay of Bengal, and\r\nstudded with volcanic islands. One island in a large bay was pinnacled\r\nwith quartz crystals as brilliant as fire. Near by roamed zebras three\r\nfeet high. Golden and blue pheasants strutted about. The beach was\r\ncovered with shell-fish. Dr. Grant did not say whether the fire-making\r\nbeavers ever held a clambake there.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ of Friday, August 28, 1835, was a notable issue. Not yet two\r\nyears old, Mr. Day’s newspaper had the satisfaction of announcing that\r\nit had achieved the largest circulation of any daily in the world.\r\nIt had, it said, 15,440 regular subscribers in New York and 700 in\r\nBrooklyn, and it sold 2,000 in the streets and 1,220 out of town--a\r\ngrand total of 19,360 copies, as against the 17,000 circulation of the\r\nLondon _Times_. The double-cylinder Napier press in the building at\r\nNassau and Spruce Streets--the corner where the _Tribune_ is to-day,\r\nand to which the _Sun_ had moved on August 3--had to run ten hours\r\na day to satisfy the public demand. People waited with more or less\r\npatience until three o’clock in the afternoon to read about the moon.\r\n\r\nThat very issue contained the most sensational instalment of all the\r\nmoon series, for through that mystic chain which included Dr. Grant,\r\nthe supplement of the Edinburgh _Journal of Science_, the “medical\r\ngentleman immediately from Scotland,” and the _Sun_, public curiosity\r\nas to the presence of human creatures on the orb of night was satisfied\r\nat last. The astronomers were looking upon the cliffs and crags of a\r\nnew part of the moon:\r\n\r\n    But whilst gazing upon them in a perspective of about half\r\n    a mile we were thrilled with astonishment to perceive four\r\n    successive flocks of large winged creatures, wholly unlike any\r\n    kind of birds, descend with a slow, even motion from the cliffs\r\n    on the western side and alight upon the plain. They were first\r\n    noticed by Dr. Herschel, who exclaimed:\r\n\r\n    “Now gentlemen, my theories against your proofs, which you have\r\n    often found a pretty even bet, we have here something worth\r\n    looking at. I was confident that if ever we found beings in\r\n    human shape it would be in this longitude, and that they would\r\n    be provided by their Creator with some extraordinary powers of\r\n    locomotion. First, exchange for my Number D.”\r\n\r\n    This lens, being soon introduced, gave us a fine half-mile\r\n    distance; and we counted three parties of these creatures, of\r\n    twelve, nine, and fifteen in each, walking erect toward a small\r\n    wood near the base of the eastern precipices. Certainly they\r\n    were like human beings, for their wings had now disappeared,\r\n    and their attitude in walking was both erect and dignified.\r\n\r\n    Having observed them at this distance for some minutes, we\r\n    introduced lens H._z_., which brought them to the apparent\r\n    proximity of eighty yards--the highest clear magnitude we\r\n    possessed until the latter end of March, when we effected an\r\n    improvement in the gas burners.\r\n\r\n    About half of the first party had passed beyond our canvas; but\r\n    of all the others we had a perfectly distinct and deliberate\r\n    view. They averaged four feet in height, were covered, except\r\n    on the face, with short and glossy copper-colored hair, and had\r\n    wings composed of a thin membrane, without hair, lying snugly\r\n    upon their backs, from the top of the shoulders to the calves\r\n    of the legs.\r\n\r\n    The face, which was of a yellowish flesh-color, was a slight\r\n    improvement upon that of the large orang-utan, being more open\r\n    and intelligent in its expression, and having a much greater\r\n    expanse of forehead. The mouth, however, was very prominent,\r\n    though somewhat relieved by a thick beard upon the lower jaw,\r\n    and by lips far more human than those of any species of the\r\n    _Simia_ genus.\r\n\r\n    In general symmetry of body and limbs they were infinitely\r\n    superior to the orang-utan; so much so that, but for their long\r\n    wings, Lieutenant Drummond said they would look as well on a\r\n    parade-ground as some of the old cockney militia. The hair on\r\n    the head was a darker color than that of the body, closely\r\n    curled, but apparently not woolly, and arranged in two curious\r\n    semi-circles over the temples of the forehead. Their feet could\r\n    only be seen as they were alternately lifted in walking; but\r\n    from what we could see of them in so transient a view, they\r\n    appeared thin and very protuberant at the heel.\r\n\r\n    Whilst passing across the canvas, and whenever we afterward saw\r\n    them, these creatures were evidently engaged in conversation;\r\n    their gesticulation, more particularly the varied action of the\r\n    hands and arms, appeared impassioned and emphatic. We hence\r\n    inferred that they were rational beings, and, although not\r\n    perhaps of so high an order as others which we discovered the\r\n    next month on the shores of the Bay of Rainbows, that they were\r\n    capable of producing works of art and contrivance.\r\n\r\n    The next view we obtained of them was still more favorable. It\r\n    was on the borders of a little lake, or expanded stream, which\r\n    we then for the first time perceived running down the valley to\r\n    the large lake, and having on its eastern margin a small wood.\r\n    Some of these creatures had crossed this water and were lying\r\n    like spread eagles on the skirts of the wood.\r\n\r\n    We could then perceive that their wings possessed great\r\n    expansion, and were similar in structure to those of the bat,\r\n    being a semi-transparent membrane expanded in curvilineal\r\n    divisions by means of straight radii, united at the back by\r\n    the dorsal integuments. But what astonished us very much\r\n    was the circumstance of this membrane being continued from\r\n    the shoulders to the legs, united all the way down, though\r\n    gradually decreasing in width. The wings seemed completely\r\n    under the command of volition, for those of the creatures whom\r\n    we saw bathing in the water spread them instantly to their full\r\n    width, waved them as ducks do theirs to shake off the water,\r\n    and then as instantly closed them again in a compact form.\r\n\r\n    Our further observation of the habits of these creatures, who\r\n    were of both sexes, led to results so very remarkable that I\r\n    prefer they should be first laid before the public in Dr.\r\n    Herschel’s own work, where I have reason to know that they are\r\n    fully and faithfully stated, however incredulously they may be\r\n    received....\r\n\r\n    The three families then almost simultaneously spread their\r\n    wings, and were lost in the dark confines of the canvas before\r\n    we had time to breathe from our paralyzing astonishment. We\r\n    scientifically denominated them the _vespertilio-homo_, or\r\n    man-bat; and they are doubtless innocent and happy creatures,\r\n    notwithstanding some of their amusements would but ill comport\r\n    with our terrestrial notions of decorum.\r\n\r\nSo ended the account, in Dr. Grant’s words, of that fateful day. The\r\neditor of the supplement, perhaps a cousin of the “medical gentleman\r\nimmediately arrived from Scotland,” added that although he had of\r\ncourse faithfully obeyed Dr. Grant’s injunction to omit “these highly\r\ncurious passages,” he did not “clearly perceive the force of the\r\nreasons assigned for it,” and he added:\r\n\r\n    From these, however, and other prohibited passages, which will\r\n    be published by Dr. Herschel with the certificates of the\r\n    civil and military authorities of the colony, and of several\r\n    Episcopal, Wesleyan, and other ministers who, in the month of\r\n    March last, were permitted under the stipulation of temporary\r\n    secrecy to visit the observatory and become eye-witnesses\r\n    of the wonders which they were requested to attest, we are\r\n    confident his forthcoming volumes will be at once the most\r\n    sublime in science and the most intense in general interest\r\n    that ever issued from the press.\r\n\r\nNew York now stopped its discussion of human slavery, the high cost of\r\nliving--apples cost as much as four cents apiece in Wall Street--and\r\nother familiar topics, and devoted its talking hours to the man-bats\r\nof the moon. The _Sun_ was stormed by people who wanted back numbers\r\nof the stories, and flooded with demands by mail. As the text of the\r\n_Journal of Science_ article indicated that the original narrative had\r\nbeen illustrated, there was a cry for pictures.\r\n\r\nMr. Day was busy with the paper and its overworked press, but he\r\ngave Mr. Locke a free hand, and that scholar took to Norris & Baker,\r\nlithographers, in the Union Building, Wall Street, the drawings which\r\nhad been intrusted to his care by the “medical gentleman immediately\r\nfrom Scotland.” Mr. Baker, described by the _Sun_ as quite the most\r\ntalented lithographic artist of the city, worked day and night on his\r\ndelightful task, that the illustrations might be ready when the _Sun’s_\r\npress should have turned out, in the hours when it was not printing\r\n_Suns_, a pamphlet containing the astronomical discoveries.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Herschel’s great work,” said the _Sun_, “is preparing for\r\npublication at ten guineas sterling, or fifty dollars; and we shall\r\ngive all the popular substance of it for twelve or thirteen cents.”\r\nThe pamphlets were to be sold two for a quarter; the lithographs at\r\ntwenty-five cents for the set.\r\n\r\nMost newspapers that mentioned the discovery of human creatures on\r\nthe moon were credulous. The _Evening Post_, edited by William Cullen\r\nBryant and Fitz-Greene Halleck--“the chanting cherubs of the _Post_,”\r\nas Colonel Webb was wont to call them--only skirted the edge of doubt:\r\n\r\n    That there should be winged people in the moon does not\r\n    strike us as more wonderful than the existence of such a\r\n    race of beings on earth; and that there does or did exist\r\n    such a race rests on the evidence of that most veracious of\r\n    voyagers, _Peter Wilkins_, whose celebrated work not only gives\r\n    an account of the general appearance and habits of a most\r\n    interesting tribe of flying Indians, but also of those more\r\n    delicate and engaging traits which the author was enabled to\r\n    discover by reason of the conjugal relations he entered into\r\n    with one of the females of the winged tribe.\r\n\r\n_Peter Wilkins_ was the hero of Robert Paltock’s imaginative book, “The\r\nLife and Adventures of Peter Wilkins, a Cornish Man,” published in\r\nLondon in 1750. Paltock’s winged people, said Southey, were “the most\r\nbeautiful creatures of imagination that were ever devised.”\r\n\r\nThe instalment of the discoveries printed on August 29 revealed to the\r\nreader the great Temple of the Moon, built of polished sapphire, with a\r\nroof of some yellow metal, supported by columns seventy feet high and\r\nsix feet in diameter:\r\n\r\n    It was open on all sides, and seemed to contain neither seats,\r\n    altars, nor offerings, but it was a light and airy structure,\r\n    nearly a hundred feet high from its white, glistening floor to\r\n    the glowing roof, and it stood upon a round, green eminence\r\n    on the eastern side of the valley. We afterward, however,\r\n    discovered two others which were in every respect facsimiles of\r\n    this one; but in neither did we perceive any visitants except\r\n    flocks of wild doves, which alighted on its lustrous pinnacles.\r\n\r\n    Had the devotees of these temples gone the way of all living,\r\n    or were the latter merely historical monuments? What did the\r\n    ingenious builders mean by the globe surrounded with flames?\r\n    Did they, by this, record any past calamity of _their_ world,\r\n    or predict any future one of _ours_? I by no means despair\r\n    of ultimately solving not only these, but a thousand other\r\n    questions which present themselves respecting the object in\r\n    this planet; for not the millionth part of her surface has yet\r\n    been explored, and we have been more desirous of collecting\r\n    the greatest possible number of new facts than of indulging in\r\n    speculative theories, however seductive to the imagination.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this astounding narrative, which totalled eleven\r\nthousand words, was printed on August 31. In the valley of the temple a\r\nnew set of man-bats was found:\r\n\r\n    We had no opportunity of seeing them actually engaged in any\r\n    work of industry or art; and, so far as we could judge, they\r\n    spent their happy hours in collecting various fruits in the\r\n    woods, in eating, flying, bathing, and loitering about upon the\r\n    summits of precipices.\r\n\r\nOne night, when the astronomers finished work, they neglectfully left\r\nthe telescope facing the eastern horizon. The risen sun burned a hole\r\nfifteen feet in circumference through the reflecting chamber, and\r\nruined part of the observatory. When the damage was repaired, the moon\r\nwas invisible, and so Dr. Herschel turned his attention to Saturn.\r\nMost of the discoveries here were technical, as the _Sun_ assured its\r\nreaders, and the narrative came to an end. An editorial note added:\r\n\r\n    This concludes the supplement with the exception of forty pages\r\n    of illustrative and mathematical notes, which would greatly\r\n    enhance the size and price of this work without commensurably\r\n    adding to its general interest. In order that our readers may\r\n    judge for themselves whether we have withheld from them any\r\n    matter of general comprehension and interest, we insert one of\r\n    the notes from those pages of the supplement which we thought\r\n    it useless to reprint; and it may be considered a fair sample\r\n    of the remainder. For ourselves, we know nothing of mathematics\r\n    beyond counting dollars and cents, but to geometricians\r\n    the following new method of measuring the height of the\r\n    lunar mountains, adopted by Sir John Herschel, may be quite\r\n    interesting.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the pretended method of measuring lunar mountains was\r\nnot interesting to laymen, but it may have been the cause of an\r\nintellectual tumult at Yale. At all events, a deputation from that\r\ncollege hurried to the steamboat and came to New York to see the\r\nwonderful supplement. The collegians saw Mr. Day, and voiced their\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n“Surely,” he replied, “you do not doubt that we have the supplement in\r\nour possession? I suppose the magazine is somewhere up-stairs, but I\r\nconsider it almost an insult that you should ask to see it.”\r\n\r\nOn their way out the Yale men heard, perhaps from the “devil,” that one\r\nLocke was interested in the matter of the moon, that he had handled\r\nthe supplement, and that he was to be seen at the foot of the stairs,\r\nsmoking his cigar and gazing across City Hall Park. They advanced\r\nupon him, and he, less brusque than Mr. Day, told the scientific\r\npilgrims that the supplement was in the hands of a printer in William\r\nStreet--giving the name and address.\r\n\r\nAs the Yale men disappeared in the direction of the printery, Locke\r\nstarted for the same goal, and more rapidly. When the Yalensians\r\narrived, the printer, primed by Locke, told them that the precious\r\npamphlet had just been sent to another shop, where certain\r\nproof-reading was to be done. And so they went from post to pillar\r\nuntil the hour came for their return to New Haven. It would not do to\r\nlinger in New York, for Professors Denison Olmsted and Elias Loomis\r\nwere that very day getting their first peep at Halley’s comet, about\r\nto make the regular appearance with which it favours the earth every\r\nseventy-six years.\r\n\r\nBut Yale was not the only part of intellectual New England to be deeply\r\ninterested in the moon and its bat-men. The _Gazette_ of Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, insisted that Edward Everett, who was then running for\r\nGovernor, had these astronomical discoveries in mind when he declared\r\nthat “we know not how soon the mind, in its researches into the\r\nlabyrinth of nature, would grasp some clue which would lead to a new\r\nuniverse and change the aspect of the world.”\r\n\r\nHarriet Martineau, who was touring America at the time, wrote in\r\nher “Sketches of Western Travel” that the ladies of Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts, subscribed to a fund to send missionaries to the\r\nbenighted luminary. When the _Sun_ articles reached Paris, they were at\r\nonce translated into illustrated pamphlets, and the caricaturists of\r\nthe Paris newspapers drew pictures of the man-bats going through the\r\nstreets singing “_Au Clair de la Lune_.” London, Edinburgh, and Glasgow\r\nmade haste to issue editions of the work.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, of course, Sir John Herschel was busy with his telescope at\r\nthe Cape, all unaware of his expanded fame in the north. Caleb Weeks,\r\nof Jamaica, Long Island, the Adam Forepaugh of his day, was setting out\r\nfor South Africa to get a supply of giraffes for his menagerie, and he\r\nhad the honour of laying in the great astronomer’s hand a clean copy of\r\nthe pamphlet. To say that Sir John was amazed at the _Sun’s_ enterprise\r\nwould be putting it mildly. When he had read the story through, he went\r\nto Caleb Weeks and said that he was overcome; that he never could hope\r\nto live up to the fame that had been heaped upon him.\r\n\r\nIn New York, meanwhile, Richard Adams Locke had spilled the beans.\r\nThere was a reporter named Finn, once employed by the _Sun_, but later\r\na scribe for the _Journal of Commerce_. He and Locke were friends.\r\nOne afternoon Gerard Hallock, who was David Hale’s partner in the\r\nproprietorship of the _Journal of Commerce_, called Finn to his office\r\nand told him to get extra copies of the _Sun_ containing the moon\r\nstory, as the _Journal_ had decided, in justice to its readers, that it\r\nmust reprint it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at the _Sun_ office, perhaps in the tap-room of the Washington\r\nHotel, Finn met Locke, and they went socially about to public places.\r\nFinn told Locke of the work on which he was engaged, and said that, as\r\nthe moon story was already being put into type at the _Journal_ office,\r\nit was likely that it would be printed on the morrow.\r\n\r\n“Don’t print it right away,” said Locke. “I wrote it myself.”\r\n\r\nThe next day the _Journal_, instead of being silently grateful for the\r\nwarning, denounced the alleged discoveries as a hoax. Mr. Bennett, who\r\nby this time had the _Herald_ once more in running order, not only\r\ncried “Hoax!” but named Locke as the author.\r\n\r\nProbably Locke was glad that the suspense was over. He is said to have\r\ntold a friend that he had not intended the story as a hoax, but as\r\nsatire.\r\n\r\n“It is quite evident,” he said, as he saw the whole country take the\r\nmarvellous narrative seriously, “that it is an abortive satire; and I\r\nam the best self-hoaxed man in the whole community.”\r\n\r\nBut while the _Sun’s_ rivals denounced the hoax, the _Sun_ was not\r\nquick to admit that it had gulled not only its own readers but almost\r\nall the scientific world. Barring the casual conversation between\r\nLocke and Finn, there was no evidence plain enough to convince the\r\nlayman that it was a hoax. The _Sun_ fenced lightly and skilfully\r\nwith all controverters. On September 16, more than two weeks after\r\nthe conclusion of the story, it printed a long editorial article on\r\nthe subject of the authenticity of the discoveries, mentioning the\r\nwide-spread interest that had been displayed in them:\r\n\r\n    Most of those who incredulously regard the whole narrative as\r\n    a hoax are generously enthusiastic in panegyrizing not only\r\n    what they are pleased to denominate its ingenuity and talent,\r\n    but also its useful effect in diverting the public mind, for\r\n    a while, from that bitter apple of discord, the abolition of\r\n    slavery, which still unhappily threatens to turn the milk of\r\n    human kindness into rancorous gall. That the astronomical\r\n    discoveries have had this effect is obvious from our exchange\r\n    papers. Who knows, therefore, whether these discoveries in\r\n    the moon, with the visions of the blissful harmony of her\r\n    inhabitants which they have revealed, may not have had the\r\n    effect of reproving the discords of a country which might be\r\n    happy as a paradise, which has valleys not less lovely than\r\n    those of the Ruby Colosseum, of the Unicorn, or of the Triads;\r\n    and which has not inferior facilities for social intercourse to\r\n    those possessed by the _vespertiliones-homines_, or any other\r\n    _homines_ whatever?\r\n\r\n    Some persons of little faith but great good nature, who\r\n    consider the “moon story,” as it is vulgarly called, an adroit\r\n    fiction of our own, are quite of the opinion that this was the\r\n    amiable moral which the writer had in view. Other readers,\r\n    however, construe the whole as an elaborate satire upon the\r\n    monstrous fabrications of the political press of the country\r\n    and the various genera and species of its party editors. In\r\n    the blue goat with the single horn, mentioned as it is in\r\n    connection with the royal arms of England, many persons fancy\r\n    they perceive the characteristics of a notorious foreigner who\r\n    is the supervising editor of one of our largest morning papers.\r\n\r\n    We confess that this idea of intended satire somewhat shook our\r\n    own faith in the genuineness of the extracts from the Edinburgh\r\n    _Journal of Science_ with which a gentleman connected with our\r\n    office furnished us as “from a medical gentleman immediately\r\n    from Scotland.”\r\n\r\n    Certain correspondents have been urging us to come out and\r\n    confess the whole to be a hoax; but this we can by no means do\r\n    until we have the testimony of the English or Scotch papers\r\n    to corroborate such a declaration. In the mean time let every\r\n    reader of the account examine it and enjoy his own opinion.\r\n    Many intelligent and scientific persons will believe it true,\r\n    and will continue to do so to their lives’ end; whilst the\r\n    skepticism of others would not be removed though they were in\r\n    Dr. Herschel’s observatory itself.\r\n\r\nThe New York showmen of that day were keen for novelty, and the moon\r\nstory helped them to it. Mr. Hannington, who ran the diorama in the\r\nCity Saloon--which was not a barroom, but an amusement house--on\r\nBroadway opposite St. Paul’s Church, put on “The Lunar Discoveries; a\r\nBrilliant Illustration of the Scientific Observation of the Surface of\r\nthe Moon, to Which Will Be Added the Reported Lunar Observations of\r\nSir John Herschel.” Hannington had been showing “The Deluge” and “The\r\nBurning of Moscow,” but the wonders of the moon proved to be far more\r\nattractive to his patrons. The _Sun_ approved of this moral spectacle:\r\n\r\n    Hannington forever and still years afterward, say we! His\r\n    panorama of the lunar discoveries, in connexion with the\r\n    beautiful dioramas, are far superior to any other exhibition in\r\n    this country.\r\n\r\nNot less popular than Hannington’s panorama was an extravaganza put\r\non by Thomas Hamblin at the Bowery Theatre, and called “Moonshine, or\r\nLunar Discoveries.” A _Sun_ man went to review it, and had to stand up;\r\nbut he was patient enough to stay, and he wrote this about the show:\r\n\r\n    It is quite evident that Hamblin does not believe a word of the\r\n    whole story, or he would never have taken the liberties with\r\n    it which he has. The wings of the man-bats and lady-bats, who\r\n    are of an orange color and look like angels in the jaundice,\r\n    are well contrived for effect; and the dialogue is highly witty\r\n    and pungent. Major Jack Downing’s blowing up a whole flock of\r\n    winged lunarians with a combustible bundle of Abolition tracts,\r\n    after vainly endeavoring to catch a long aim at them with his\r\n    rifle, is capital; as are also his puns and jokes upon the\r\n    splendid scenery of the Ruby Colosseum. Take it altogether, it\r\n    is the most amusing thing that has been on these boards for a\r\n    long time.\r\n\r\nThus the moon eclipsed the regular stars of the New York stage. Even\r\nMrs. Duff, the most pathetic _Isabella_ that ever appeared in “The\r\nFatal Marriage,” saw her audiences thin out at the Franklin Theatre.\r\nSol Smith’s drolleries in “The Lying Valet,” at the Park Theatre, could\r\nnot rouse the laughter that the burlesque man-bats caused at the Bowery.\r\n\r\nAll this time there was a disappointed man in Baltimore; disappointed\r\nbecause the moon stories had caused him to abandon one of the most\r\nambitious stories he had attempted. This was Edgar Allan Poe, and the\r\nstory he dropped was “Hans Pfaall.”\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1835 the Harpers issued an edition of Sir John\r\nHerschel’s “Treatise on Astronomy,” and Poe, who read it, was\r\ndeeply interested in the chapter on the possibility of future lunar\r\ninvestigations:\r\n\r\n    The theme excited my fancy, and I longed to give free rein to\r\n    it in depicting my day-dreams about the scenery of the moon; in\r\n    short, I longed to write a story embodying these dreams. The\r\n    obvious difficulty, of course, was that of accounting for the\r\n    narrator’s acquaintance with the satellite; and the equally\r\n    obvious mode of surmounting the difficulty was the supposition\r\n    of an extraordinary telescope.\r\n\r\nPoe spoke of this ambition to John Pendleton Kennedy, of Baltimore,\r\nalready the author of “Swallow Barn,” and later to have the honour of\r\nwriting, as the result of a jest by Thackeray, the fourth chapter of\r\nthe second volume of “The Virginians.” Kennedy assured Poe that the\r\nmechanics of telescope construction were so fixed that it would be\r\nimpossible to impart verisimilitude to a tale based on a superefficient\r\ntelescope. So Poe resorted to other means of bringing the moon close to\r\nthe reader’s eye:\r\n\r\n    I fell back upon a style half plausible, half bantering, and\r\n    resolved to give what interest I could to an actual passage\r\n    from the earth to the moon, describing the lunar scenery as if\r\n    surveyed and personally examined by the narrator.\r\n\r\nPoe wrote the first part of “Hans Pfaall,” and published it in the\r\n_Southern Literary Messenger_, of which he was then editor, at\r\nRichmond, Virginia. Three weeks afterward the first instalment of\r\nLocke’s moon story appeared in the _Sun_. At the moment Poe believed\r\nthat his idea had been kidnapped:\r\n\r\n    No sooner had I seen the paper than I understood the jest,\r\n    which not for a moment could I doubt had been suggested by\r\n    my own _jeu d’esprit_. Some of the New York journals--the\r\n    _Transcript_, among others--saw the matter in the same light,\r\n    and published the moon story side by side with “Hans Pfaall,”\r\n    thinking that the author of the one had been detected in the\r\n    author of the other.\r\n\r\n    Although the details are, with some exceptions, very\r\n    dissimilar, still I maintain that the general features\r\n    of the two compositions are nearly identical. Both are\r\n    hoaxes--although one is in a tone of mere banter, the other of\r\n    down-right earnest; both hoaxes are on one subject, astronomy;\r\n    both on the same point of that subject, the moon; both\r\n    professed to have derived exclusive information from a foreign\r\n    country; and both attempt to give plausibility by minuteness of\r\n    scientific detail. Add to all this, that nothing of a similar\r\n    nature had even been attempted before these two hoaxes, the one\r\n    of which followed immediately upon the heels of the other.\r\n\r\n    Having stated the case, however, in this form, I am bound to\r\n    do Mr. Locke the justice to say that he denies having seen my\r\n    article prior to the publication of his own; I am bound to add,\r\n    also, that I believe him.\r\n\r\nNor can any unbiassed person who reads, for purpose of comparison, the\r\n“Astronomical Discoveries” and “Hans Pfaall” suspect that Locke based\r\nhis hoax on the story of the Rotterdam debtor who blew his creditors\r\nto bits and sailed to the moon in a balloon. Chalk and cheese are much\r\nmore alike than these two products of genius.\r\n\r\nPoe may have intended to fall back upon “a style half plausible,\r\nhalf bantering,” as he described it, but there is not the slightest\r\nplausibility about “Hans Pfaall.” It is as near to humour as the great,\r\ndark mind could get. “Mere banter,” as he later described it, is\r\nbetter. The very episode of the dripping pitcher of water, used to wake\r\n_Hans_ at an altitude where even alcohol would freeze, is enough proof,\r\nif proof at all were necessary, to strip the tale of its last shred\r\nof verisimilitude. No child of twelve would believe in _Hans_, while\r\nLocke’s fictitious “Dr. Grant” deceived nine-tenths--the estimate is\r\nPoe’s--of those who read the narrative of the great doings at the Cape\r\nof Good Hope.\r\n\r\nLocke had spoiled a promising tale for Poe--who tore up the second\r\ninstalment of “Hans Pfaall” when he “found that he could add very\r\nlittle to the minute and authentic account of Sir John Herschel”--but\r\nthe poet took pleasure, in later years, in picking the _Sun’s_ moon\r\nstory to bits.\r\n\r\n“That the public were misled, even for an instant,” Poe declared in his\r\ncritical essay on Locke’s writings, “merely proves the gross ignorance\r\nwhich, ten or twelve years ago, was so prevalent on astronomical\r\ntopics.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Locke’s own description of the telescope, said Poe,\r\nit could not have brought the moon nearer than five miles; yet Sir\r\nJohn--Locke’s Sir John--saw flowers and described the eyes of birds.\r\nLocke had an ocean on the moon, although it had been established beyond\r\nquestion that the visible side of the moon is dry. The most ridiculous\r\nthing about the moon story, said Poe, was that the narrator described\r\nthe entire bodies of the man-bats, whereas, if they were seen at all by\r\nan observer on the earth, they would manifestly appear as if walking\r\nheels up and head down, after the fashion of flies on a ceiling.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the hoax, Poe admits, “was, upon the whole, the greatest hit\r\nin the way of sensation--of merely popular sensation--ever made by any\r\nsimilar fiction either in America or Europe.” Whether Locke intended it\r\nas satire or not--a debatable point--it was a hoax of the first water.\r\nIt deceived more persons, and for a longer time, than any other fake\r\never written: and, as the _Sun_ pointed out, it hurt nobody--except,\r\nperhaps, the feelings of Dr. Dick, of Dundee--and it took the public\r\nmind away from less agreeable matters. Some of the wounded scientists\r\nroared, but the public, particularly the New York public, took the\r\nexposure of Locke’s literary villainy just as Sir John Herschel\r\naccepted it--with a grin.\r\n\r\nAs for the inspiration of the moon story, the record is nebulous.\r\nIf Poe was really grieved at his first thought that Locke had taken\r\nfrom him the main imaginative idea--that the moon was inhabited--then\r\nPoe was oversensitive or uninformed, for that idea was at least two\r\ncenturies old.\r\n\r\nFrancis Godwin, an English bishop and author, who was born in 1562, and\r\nwho died just two centuries before the _Sun_ was first printed, wrote\r\n“The Man in the Moone, or a Discourse of a Voyage Thither by Domingo\r\nGonsales, the Speedy Messenger.” This was published in London in 1638,\r\nfive years after the author’s death.\r\n\r\nIn the same year there appeared a book called “The Discovery of a World\r\nin the Moone,” which contained arguments to prove the moon habitable.\r\nIt was written by John Wilkins--no relative of the fictitious _Peter_\r\nof Paltock’s story, but a young English clergyman who later became\r\nBishop of Chester, and who was the first secretary of the Royal\r\nSociety. Two years later Wilkins added to his “Discovery of a World” a\r\n“Discourse Concerning the Possibility of a Passage Thither.”\r\n\r\nCyrano de Bergerac, he of the long nose and the passion for poetry and\r\nduelling, later to be immortalized by Rostand, read these products\r\nof two Englishmen’s fancy, and about 1650 he turned out his joyful\r\n“Histoire Comique des Etats et Empires de la Lune.” But Bergerac had\r\nalso been influenced by Dante and by Lucian, the latter being the\r\nsupposed inspiration of the fanciful narratives of Rabelais and Swift.\r\nPerhaps these writers influenced Godwin and Wilkins also; so the\r\ntrail, zigzagged and ramifying, goes back to the second century. It is\r\nhard to indict a man for being inspired, and in the case of the moon\r\nstory there is no evidence of plagiarism. If “Hans Pfaall” were to be\r\ncompared with Locke’s story for hoaxing qualities, it would only suffer\r\nby the comparison. It would appear as the youthful product of a tyro,\r\nas against the cunning work of an artist of almost devilish ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIs there any doubt that the moon hoax was the sole work of Richard\r\nAdams Locke? So far as concerns the record of the _Sun_, the comments\r\nof Locke’s American contemporaries, and the belief of Benjamin H. Day,\r\nexpressed in 1883 in a talk with Edward P. Mitchell, the answer must\r\nbe in the negative. Yet it must be set down, as a literary curiosity\r\nat least, that it has been believed in France and by at least one\r\nEnglish antiquary of repute that the moon hoax was the work of a\r\nFrenchman--Jean Nicolas Nicollet, the astronomer.\r\n\r\nNicollet was born at Cluses, in Savoy, in 1786. First a cowherd, he did\r\nnot learn to read until he was twelve. Once at school his progress was\r\nrapid, and at nineteen he become preceptor of mathematics at Chambry.\r\nHe went to Paris, where in 1817 he was appointed secretary-librarian\r\nof the Observatory, and he studied astronomy with Laplace, who refers\r\nto Nicollet’s assistance in his works. In 1823 he was appointed to the\r\ngovernment bureau of longitudes, and at the same time was professor of\r\nmathematics in the College of Louis le Grand.\r\n\r\nHe became a master of English, and through this knowledge and his own\r\nmathematical genius he was able to assemble, for the use of the French\r\nlife-insurance companies, all that was known, and much that he himself\r\ndiscovered, of actuarial methods; this being incorporated in his letter\r\nto M. Outrequin on “Assurances Having for Their Basis the Probable\r\nDuration of Human Life.” He also wrote “Memoirs upon the Measure of an\r\nArc of Parallel Midway Between the Pole and the Equator” (1826), and\r\n“Course of Mathematics for the Use of Mariners” (1830).\r\n\r\nIn 1831 Nicollet failed in speculation, losing not only his own fortune\r\nbut that of others. He came to the United States, arriving early in\r\n1832, the very year that Locke came to America. It is probable that\r\nhe was in New York, but there is no evidence as to the length of\r\nhis stay. It is known, however, that he was impoverished, and that\r\nhe was assisted by Bishop Chanche, of Natchez, to go on with his\r\nchosen work--an exploration of the Mississippi and its tributaries.\r\nHe made astronomical and barometrical observations, determined the\r\ngeographical position and elevation of many important points, and\r\nstudied Indian lore.\r\n\r\nThe United States government was so well pleased with Nicollet’s\r\nwork that it sent him to the Far West for further investigations,\r\nwith Lieutenant John C. Frémont as assistant. His “Geology of the\r\nUpper Mississippi Region and of the Cretaceous Formation of the Upper\r\nMissouri” was one of the results of his journeys. After this he tried,\r\nthrough letters, to regain his lost standing in France by seeking\r\nelection to the Paris Academy of Sciences, but he was black-balled,\r\nand, broken-hearted, he died in Washington in 1843.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman who believed that Nicollet was the author of the moon\r\nhoax was Augustus De Morgan, father of the late William De Morgan, the\r\nnovelist, and himself a distinguished mathematician and litterateur.\r\nHe was professor of mathematics at University College, London, at the\r\ntime when the moon pamphlet first appeared in England. His “Budget\r\nof Paradoxes,” an interesting collection of literary curiosities\r\nand puzzles, which he had written, but not carefully assembled, was\r\npublished in 1872, the year after his death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF THE MOON HOAX\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    A MOON SCENE, FROM LOCKE’S GREAT DECEPTION\r\n]\r\n\r\nTwo fragments, printed separately in this volume, refer to the moon\r\nhoax. The first is this:\r\n\r\n    “Some Account of the Great Astronomical Discoveries Lately\r\n      Made by Sir John Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope.”--Second\r\n      Edition, London, 12mo, 1836.\r\n\r\nThis is a curious hoax, evidently written by a person versed in\r\nastronomy and clever at introducing probable circumstances and\r\nundesigned coincidences. It first appeared in a newspaper. It makes Sir\r\nJ. Herschel discover men, animals, _et cetera_, in the moon, of which\r\nmuch detail is given. There seems to have been a French edition, the\r\noriginal, and English editions in America, whence the work came into\r\nBritain; but whether the French was published in America or at Paris\r\nI do not know. There is no doubt that it was produced in the United\r\nStates by M. Nicollet, an astronomer, once of Paris, and a fugitive of\r\nsome kind.\r\n\r\nAbout him I have heard two stories. First, that he fled to America with\r\nfunds not his own, and that this book was a mere device to raise the\r\nwind. Secondly, that he was a protégé of Laplace, and of the Polignac\r\nparty, and also an outspoken man. That after the Revolution he was so\r\nobnoxious to the republican party that he judged it prudent to quit\r\nFrance; which he did in debt, leaving money for his creditors, but\r\nnot enough, with M. Bouvard. In America he connected himself with an\r\nassurance office. The moon story was written, and sent to France,\r\nchiefly with the intention of entrapping M. Arago, Nicollet’s especial\r\nfoe, into the belief of it. And those who narrate this version of the\r\nstory wind up by saying that M. Arago _was_ entrapped, and circulated\r\nthe wonders through Paris until a letter from Nicollet to M. Bouvard\r\nexplained the hoax.\r\n\r\nI have no personal knowledge of either story; but as the poor man had\r\nto endure the first, it is but right that the second should be told\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe second fragment reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The Moon Hoax; or, the Discovery That the Moon Has a Vast\r\n      Population of Human Beings.” By Richard Adams Locke.--New\r\n      York, 1859.\r\n\r\nThis is a reprint of the hoax already mentioned. I suppose “R. A.\r\nLocke” is the name assumed by M. Nicollet. The publisher informs us\r\nthat when the hoax first appeared day by day in a morning newspaper,\r\nthe circulation increased fivefold, and the paper obtained a permanent\r\nfooting. Besides this, an edition of sixty thousand was sold off in\r\nless than one month.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was also published under the name of A. R. Grant.\r\nSohnke’s “Bibliotheca Mathematica” confounds this Grant with Professor\r\nR. Grant of Glasgow, the author of the “History of Physical Astronomy,”\r\nwho is accordingly made to guarantee the discoveries in the moon. I\r\nhope Adams Locke will not merge in J. C. Adams, the codiscoverer of\r\nNeptune. Sohnke gives the titles of three French translations of “The\r\nMoon Hoax” at Paris, of one at Bordeaux, and of Italian translations at\r\nParma, Palermo, and Milan.\r\n\r\nA correspondent, who is evidently fully master of details, which he has\r\ngiven at length, informs me that “The Moon Hoax” first appeared in the\r\nNew York _Sun_, of which R. A. Locke was editor. It so much resembled\r\na story then recently published by Edgar A. Poe, in a Southern paper,\r\n“Adventures of Hans Pfaall,” that some New York journals published\r\nthe two side by side. Mr. Locke, when he left the New York _Sun_,\r\nstarted another paper, and discovered the manuscript of Mungo Park;\r\nbut this did not deceive. The _Sun_, however, continued its career,\r\nand had a great success in an account of a balloon voyage from England\r\nto America, in seventy-five hours, by Mr. Monck Mason, Mr. Harrison\r\nAinsworth, and others.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that M. Nicollet was the author of “The Moon Hoax,”\r\nwritten in a way which marks the practised observatory astronomer\r\nbeyond all doubt, and by evidence seen in the most minute details.\r\nNicollet had an eye to Europe. I suppose that he took Poe’s story\r\nand made it a basis for his own. Mr. Locke, it would seem, when he\r\nattempted a fabrication for himself, did not succeed.\r\n\r\nIn his remark that “there seems to have been a French edition, the\r\noriginal,” Augustus De Morgan was undoubtedly misled, for every\r\nauthority consultable agrees that the French pamphlets were merely\r\ntranslations of the story originally printed in the _Sun_; and De\r\nMorgan had learned this when he wrote his second note on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe M. Arago whom De Morgan believes Nicollet sought to entrap was\r\nDominique François Arago, the celebrated astronomer. In 1830, as a\r\nreward for his many accomplishments, he was made perpetual secretary\r\nof the Paris Academy of Sciences, and in the following year--the\r\nyear of Nicollet’s fall from grace--he was elected to the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. As to the intimation that Arago was really misled by the moon\r\nstory, it is unlikely. W. N. Griggs, a contemporary of Locke, insists\r\nin a memoir of that journalist that the narrative was read by Arago to\r\nthe members of the Academy, and was received with mingled denunciation\r\nand laughter. But hoaxing Arago in a matter of astronomy would have\r\nbeen a difficult feat. Surely the discrepancies pointed out by Poe\r\nwould have been noticed immediately.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, easy to understand De Morgan’s belief that Nicollet\r\nwas the author of the moon story. Much of the narrative, particularly\r\nparts which have here been omitted, is made up of technicalities which\r\ncould have come only from the pen of a man versed in the intricacies\r\nof astronomical science. They were not put into the story to interest\r\n_Sun_ readers, for they are far over the layman’s head, but for the\r\npurpose of adding verisimilitude to a yarn which, stripped of the\r\ntechnical trimmings, would have been pretty bald.\r\n\r\nIt was plain to De Morgan that Nicollet was one of the few men alive in\r\n1835 who could have woven the scientific fabric in which the hoax was\r\ndisguised. It was also apparent to him that Nicollet, jealous of the\r\npopularity of Arago, might have had a motive for launching a satire, if\r\nnot a hoax. And then there was Nicollet’s presence in America at the\r\ntime of the moon story’s publication, Nicollet’s knowledge of English,\r\nand Nicollet’s poverty. The coincidences are interesting, if nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet us see what the French said about Nicollet and the story that came\r\nto the _Sun_ from “a medical gentleman immediately from Scotland.” In\r\na sketch of Nicollet printed in the “Biographie Universelle” (Michaud,\r\nParis, 1884), the following appears:\r\n\r\n    There has been attributed to him an article which appeared in\r\n    the daily papers of France, and which, in the form of a letter\r\n    dated from the United States, spoke of an improvement in the\r\n    telescope invented by the learned astronomer Herschel, who was\r\n    then at the Cape of Good Hope. It has been generally and with\r\n    much probability attributed to Nicollet.\r\n\r\n    With the aid of this admirable improvement Herschel was\r\n    supposed to have succeeded in discovering on the surface of the\r\n    moon live beings, buildings of various kinds, and a multitude\r\n    of other interesting things. The description of these objects\r\n    and the ingenious method employed by the English astronomer to\r\n    attain his purpose was so detailed, and covered with a veneer\r\n    of science so skilfully applied, that the general public was\r\n    startled by the announcement of the discovery, of which North\r\n    America hastened to send us the news.\r\n\r\n    It has even been said that several astronomers and physicists\r\n    of our country were taken in for a moment. That seems hardly\r\n    probable to us. It was easy to perceive that it was a hoax\r\n    written by a learned and mischievous person.\r\n\r\nThe “Nouvelle Biographie Générale” (Paris, 1862), says of Nicollet:\r\n\r\n    He is believed to be the author of the anonymous pamphlet\r\n    which appeared in 1836 on the discoveries in the moon made by\r\n    Herschel at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nCruel, consistent Locke, never to have written down the details of\r\nthe conception and birth of the best invention that ever spoofed the\r\nworld! He leaves history to wonder whether it be possible that, with\r\none word added, the French biographer was right, and that it was “a\r\nhoax written by a learned and _a_ mischievous person.” Certain it is\r\nthat Nicollet never wrote all of the moon story; certain, too, that\r\nLocke wrote much, if not all of it. The calculations of the angles of\r\nreflection might have been Nicollet’s, but the blue unicorn is the\r\nunicorn of Locke.\r\n\r\nNo man can say when the germ of the story first took shape. It might\r\nhave been designed at any time after Herschel laid the plans for his\r\nvoyage to the Cape of Good Hope, and that was at least two years before\r\nit appeared in the _Sun_. Was Nicollet in New York then, and did he and\r\nLocke lay their heads together across a table at the American Hotel and\r\nplan the great deceit?\r\n\r\nThere was one head full of figures and the stars; another crammed with\r\nthe imagination that brought forth the fire-making biped beavers and\r\nthe fascinating, if indecorous, human bats. If they never met, more is\r\nthe pity. Whether they met, none can say. Go to ask the ghosts of the\r\nAmerican Hotel, and you find it gone, and in its place the Woolworth\r\nBuilding, earth’s spear levelled at the laughing moon.\r\n\r\nWhatever happened, the credit must rest with Richard Adams Locke.\r\nEven if the technical embellishments of the moon story were borrowed,\r\nstill his was the genius that builded the great temple, made flowers\r\nto bloom in the lunar valleys, and grew the filmy wings on the\r\n_vespertilio-homo_. His was the art that caused the bricklayer of\r\nCherry Street to sit late beside his candle, spelling out the rare\r\nstory with joyous labour. It must have been a reward to Locke, even to\r\nthe last of his seventy years, to know that he had made people read\r\nnewspapers who never had read them before; for that is what he really\r\naccomplished by this huge, complex lie.\r\n\r\n“From the epoch of the hoax,” wrote Poe, “the Sun shone with\r\nunmitigated splendor. Its success firmly established the ‘penny system’\r\nthroughout the country, and (through the _Sun_) consequently we are\r\nindebted to the genius of Mr. Locke for one of the most important steps\r\never yet taken in the pathway of human progress.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDAY FINDS A RIVAL IN BENNETT\r\n\r\n  _The Success of “The Sun” Leads to the Founding of the\r\n    “Herald.”--Enterprises and Quarrels of a Furious Young\r\n    Journalism.--The Picturesque Webb.--Maria Monk._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of Richard Adams Locke as a _Sun_ reporter did not end\r\nwith the moon hoax. Far from expressing regret that its employee had\r\ngulled half the earth, the _Sun_ continued to meet exposure with a\r\ncalm and almost flippant front, insisting that it would never admit\r\nthe non-existence of the man-bats until official contradiction arrived\r\nfrom Edinburgh or the Cape of Good Hope. The paper realized the value,\r\nin public interest, of Locke’s name, and was proud to announce, in\r\nNovember of 1835, that it had commissioned Locke to write another\r\nseries of articles, telling the story of the “Life and Adventures of\r\nManuel Fernandez, otherwise Richard C. Jackson, convicted of the murder\r\nof John Roberts, and to be executed at the Bellevue Prison, New York,\r\non Thursday next, the 19th instant.”\r\n\r\nThis was a big beat, for the young men of the _Courier and Enquirer_,\r\nand perhaps of the _Herald_, had been trying to get a yarn from\r\nthe criminal, a Spaniard who had served in foreign wars, had been\r\ncaptured by savages in Africa, and had had many other adventures.\r\nFernandez was convicted of killing another sailor for his attention\r\nto Fernandez’s mistress, a Mrs. Schultz; and for about three weeks\r\nLocke spent several hours a day in the condemned man’s cell. The “Life\r\nand Adventures,” which was printed on the first page of the _Sun_, ran\r\nserially from November 14 to November 25, and was read with avidity.\r\n\r\nIt was ironical that the hero of the story, who had expressed to Locke\r\nan eagerness to have his career set before the public in its true\r\nlight, was prevented from reading the later instalments; for the law,\r\ntaking no cognizance of the literary side of the matter, went about its\r\nbusiness, and Fernandez was hanged in the Bellevue yard on the 19th, a\r\nmorning when the _Sun’s_ narrative had wrecked the sailor off the coast\r\nof Wales. Mr. Locke reported the execution and drew upon the autopsy to\r\nverify the “Adventures.”\r\n\r\n    It is an interesting fact that the corpse of Fernandez\r\n    exhibited marks of all those serious injuries which are\r\n    recorded in the course of our narrative of his life, more\r\n    particularly that dreadful fracture of his vertebræ which he\r\n    suffered in Leghorn.\r\n\r\nThe mere word of a “medical gentleman immediately from Scotland” was no\r\nlonger to be relied upon!\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ story of the great fire of December, 1835, sounds like\r\nLocke, but it may have been written by one of the other bright young\r\nmen who worked for Benjamin H. Day. Among them were William M. Prall,\r\nwho succeeded Wisner as the court reporter, and Lucius Robinson.\r\n\r\n“Robinson seemed to be a young man of excellent ideas, but not very\r\nhighly educated,” Mr. Day remarked about fifty years later.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the Day standards were very high. Robinson was twenty six when\r\nhe worked on the _Sun_. He had been educated at an academy in Delhi,\r\nNew York, and after that had studied law and been admitted to the bar.\r\nHe was too poor to practise at once, and went into newspaper work to\r\nmake a living. After leaving the _Sun_ he was elected district attorney\r\nof Greene County, and in 1843 was appointed master of chancery in\r\nNew York. He left the Democratic party when the Republican party was\r\norganized, but returned to his old political allegiance after the Civil\r\nWar. In 1876 he was elected Governor of New York--an achievement which\r\nstill left him a little less famous than his fellow reporter, Locke.\r\n\r\n“Give us one of your real Moscow fires,” sighed the _Sun_ in the first\r\nweek of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe prayer was answered a little more than two years later, when about\r\ntwenty blocks south of Wall Street, between Broad Street and the\r\nEast River, were consumed. The fire started late in the evening of\r\nWednesday, December 16, and all that the _Sun_ printed about it the\r\nnext morning was one triple-leaded paragraph:\r\n\r\n    POSTSCRIPT--HALF PAST 1 O’CLOCK--A TREMENDOUS CONFLAGRATION\r\n    is now raging in the lower part of the city. The Merchants’\r\n    Exchange is in flames. Nearly all the blocks in the triangle\r\n    bounded by William and Wall Streets and the East River are\r\n    consumed! Several hundred buildings are already down, and the\r\n    firemen have given out. God only knows when the fire will be\r\n    arrested.\r\n\r\nOn Friday morning the _Sun_ had two and a half columns about the fire,\r\nand gave an approximately correct estimate that seven hundred buildings\r\nhad been burned, at a loss of twenty million dollars. The calamity\r\nprovided an opportunity for the fine writing then indulged in, and the\r\nfire reporter did not overlook it; nor did he forget Moscow. Here are\r\ntypical extracts:\r\n\r\n    Where but thirty hours since was the rich and prosperous\r\n    theater of a great and productive commerce, where enterprise\r\n    and wealth energized with bold and commanding efforts, now\r\n    sits despondency in sackcloth and a wide and dreary waste of\r\n    desolation reigns.\r\n\r\n    It seemed as if God were running in his anger and sweeping away\r\n    with the besom of his wrath the proudest monuments of man.\r\n    Destruction traveled and triumphed on every breeze, and billows\r\n    of fire rolled over and buried in their burning bosoms the\r\n    hopes and fortunes of thousands. Like the devouring elements\r\n    when it fed on Moscow’s palaces and towers, it was literally\r\n    a “sea of fire,” and the terrors of that night of wo and ruin\r\n    rolling years will not be able to efface.\r\n\r\n    The merchants of the First Ward, like Marius in the ruins of\r\n    Carthage, sit with melancholy moans, gazing at the graves of\r\n    their fortunes, and the mournful mementoes of the dreadful\r\n    devastation that reigns.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the following day the _Sun_ got out an extra\r\nedition of thirty thousand copies, its normal morning issue of\r\ntwenty-three thousand being too small to satisfy the popular demand.\r\nThe presses ran without stopping for nearly twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the 21st, the _Sun_ had the enterprise to print a map of\r\nthe burned district. Copies of the special fire editions went all over\r\nthe world. At least one of them ran up against poetic justice. When it\r\nreached Canton, China, six months after the fire, the English newspaper\r\nthere classed the story of the conflagration with Locke’s “Astronomical\r\nDiscoveries,” and begged its readers not to be alarmed by the new hoax.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had grown more and more prosperous. In the latter part of\r\n1835 its four pages, each eleven and one-half by eighteen inches,\r\nwere so taken up with advertising that it was not unusual to find\r\nreading-matter in only five of the twenty columns. Some days the\r\npublisher would apologize for leaving out advertisements, on other\r\ndays, for having so little room for news. He promised relief, and it\r\ncame on January 4, 1836, when the paper was enlarged. It remained a\r\nfour-page _Sun_, but the pages were increased in size to fourteen by\r\ntwenty inches. In announcing the enlargement, the third in a year, the\r\n_Sun_ remarked:\r\n\r\n    We are now enabled to print considerably more than twenty-two\r\n    thousand copies, on both sides, in less than eight hours. No\r\n    establishment in this country has such facilities, and no daily\r\n    newspaper in the world enjoys so extensive a circulation.\r\n\r\nIn the first enlarged edition Mr. Day made the boast that the _Sun_\r\nnow had a circulation more than double that of all the sixpenny\r\nrespectables combined. He had a word, too, about the penny papers that\r\nhad sprung up in the _Sun’s_ wake:\r\n\r\n    One after another they dropped and fell in quick succession\r\n    as they had sprung up; and all, with but one exception worth\r\n    regarding, have gone to the “receptacle of things lost upon\r\n    earth.” Many of these departed ephemerals have struggled hard\r\n    to keep within their nostrils the breath of life; and it is\r\n    a singular fact that with scarcely an exception they have\r\n    employed, as a means of bringing a knowledge of their being\r\n    before the public, the most unlimited and reckless abuse\r\n    of ourselves, the impeachment of our character, public and\r\n    private; the implications, moral and political; in short,\r\n    calumny in all its forms.\r\n\r\n    As to the last survivor of them worth note, which remains, we\r\n    have only to say, the little world we opened has proved large\r\n    enough for us both.\r\n\r\nThe exception to the general rule of early mortality was of course the\r\n_Herald_. In spite of this broad attitude toward his only successful\r\ncompetitor, Day could not keep from swapping verbal shots with\r\nBennett. The _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    Bennett, whose only chance of dying an upright man will be that\r\n    of hanging perpendicularly upon a rope, falsely charges the\r\n    proprietor of this paper with being an infidel, the natural\r\n    effect of which calumny will be that every reader will believe\r\n    him to be a good Christian.\r\n\r\nDay had a dislike for Colonel Webb, of the _Courier and Enquirer_,\r\nalmost as great as his enmity toward Bennett; so when Webb assaulted\r\nBennett on January 19, 1836, it was rather a hard story to write. This\r\nis the _Sun’s_ account of the fray:\r\n\r\n    Low as he had fallen, both in the public estimation and his\r\n    own, we were astonished to learn last evening that Colonel\r\n    Webb had stooped so far beneath anything of which we had ever\r\n    conceived it possible for him to be guilty, as publicly,\r\n    and before the eyes of hundreds who knew him, to descend to\r\n    a public personal chastisement of that villainous libel on\r\n    humanity of all kinds, the notorious vagabond Bennett. But so\r\n    it is.\r\n\r\n    As the story is told to us by an eye-witness, the colonel met\r\n    the brawling coward in Wall Street, took him by the throat,\r\n    and with a cowhide striped the human parody from head to foot.\r\n    For the space of nearly twenty minutes, as we are told, did\r\n    the right arm of the colonel ply his weapon with unremitted\r\n    activity, at which time the bystanders, who evidently enjoyed\r\n    the scene mightily, interceded in behalf of the suffering,\r\n    supplicating wretch, and Webb suffered him to run.\r\n\r\n    Had it been a dog, or any other decent animal, or had the\r\n    colonel himself with a pair of good long tongs removed a\r\n    polecat from his office, we know not that we would have been so\r\n    much surprised; but that he could, by any possibility, have so\r\n    far descended from himself as to come in public contact with\r\n    the veriest reptile that ever defiled the paths of decency, we\r\n    could not have believed.\r\n\r\nWebb’s quarrel with Bennett grew out of the _Herald’s_ financial\r\narticles. Bennett was the first newspaperman to see the news value of\r\nWall Street. When he was a writer on the _Courier and Enquirer_, and\r\none of Webb’s most useful men, he made a study of stocks, not as a\r\nspeculator, but as an investigator. He had a taste for money matters.\r\nIn 1824, five years after his arrival in America from the land of his\r\nbirth, Scotland, he tried to establish a commercial school in New York\r\nand to lecture on political economy. He could not make a go of it, and\r\nso returned to newspaper work as reporter, paragrapher, and poet.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 he became Washington correspondent of the _Enquirer_, and\r\nit was at his suggestion that Webb, in 1829, bought that paper and\r\nconsolidated it with his own _Courier_. Bennett was a Tammany Society\r\nman, therefore a Jacksonian. He left Webb because of Webb’s support of\r\nNicholas Biddle, and started a Jackson organ, the _Pennsylvanian_, in\r\nPhiladelphia. This was a failure.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Bennett had seen the _Sun_ rise, and he felt that there\r\nmust be room for another penny paper in New York. With his knowledge\r\nof stocks he believed that he could make Wall Street news a telling\r\nfeature. In his second issue of the _Herald_, May 11, 1835, he printed\r\nthe first money-market report, and three days later he ran a table\r\nof sales on the Stock Exchange. At this time, and for three years\r\nafterward, Bennett visited Wall Street daily and wrote his own reports.\r\n\r\nHis flings at the United States Bank, of which Webb’s friend Biddle\r\nwas president, and his stories of alleged stock speculations by the\r\ncolonel himself, were the cause of Webb’s animosity toward his former\r\nassociate. Bennett took Webb’s assault calmly, and even wrote it up\r\nin the _Herald_, suggesting at the end that Webb’s torn overcoat had\r\nsuffered more damage than anything else.\r\n\r\nDay’s quarrel with Bennett, which never reached the physical stage, was\r\nthe natural outcome of an intense rivalry among the most successful\r\npenny papers of that period--the _Sun_, the _Herald_, and the\r\n_Transcript_. Against the sixpenny respectables these three were one\r\nfor all and all for one, but against one another they were as venomous\r\nas a young newspaper of that day felt that it had to be to show that it\r\nwas alive.\r\n\r\nDay’s antagonism toward Webb was sporadic. Most of the time the young\r\nowner of the _Sun_ treated the fiery editor of the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_ as flippantly as he could, knowing that Webb liked to be\r\ntaken seriously. Day’s constant _bête noire_ was the commercial and\r\nforeign editor of Webb’s paper, Mr. Hoskin, an Englishman.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 1836, the _Sun_ charged that Webb and Hoskin had\r\nrigged a “diabolical plot” against it. The sixpenny papers had formed\r\na combination for the purpose of sharing the expense of running\r\nhorse-expresses from Philadelphia to New York, bringing the Washington\r\nnews more quickly than the penny papers could get it by mail. The _Sun_\r\nand the _Transcript_ then formed a combination of their own, and in\r\nthis way saved themselves from being beaten on Jackson’s message, sent\r\nto Congress in December, 1835.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1836, Jackson sent a special message to Congress. It\r\nwas delivered on Monday, the 18th, and on Wednesday, the 20th, the\r\n_Sun_ published a column summary of it. Webb made the charge that his\r\nmessenger from Washington had been lured into Day’s offices, and that\r\nthe _Sun_ got its story by opening the package containing the message\r\nintended for the _Courier and Enquirer._ The _Sun_ replied that it\r\nreceived the message legitimately, and that the whole thing was a\r\nscheme to discredit Mr. Day and his bookkeeper, Moses Y. Beach:\r\n\r\n    The insinuation of Webb that we violated the sanctity of a seal\r\n    we hurl back in proud defiance to his own brow.\r\n\r\nWebb went to the police and to the grand jury, and for a few days it\r\nlooked as if the hostile editors might reach for something of larger\r\ncalibre than pens. Thus the _Sun_ of January 22:\r\n\r\n    We were informed yesterday at the police office, and\r\n    subsequently by a gentleman from Wall Street, that Webb, of\r\n    the _Courier and Enquirer_, had openly threatened to make a\r\n    personal assault upon us. It was lucky for him that we did not\r\n    hear this threat; but we can now only say that if such, or\r\n    anything similar to it, be his intention, he will find each of\r\n    the three editors of the _Sun_ always provided with a brace\r\n    of “mahogany stock” pistols, to accommodate him in any way he\r\n    likes, or may not like.\r\n\r\nThe specification of “mahogany stock” referred to Colonel Webb’s own\r\nsupposed predilection for pistols of that description. Mr. Day and his\r\naids may have carried these handsome weapons, but it is not on record\r\nthat they made use of them, or that they had occasion to do so. Persons\r\ngunning for editors seemed to neglect Mr. Day in favour of Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this fierce clash with Webb over than the _Sun_ found\r\nitself bombarded from many sides in the war over Maria Monk. This\r\nwoman’s “Awful Disclosures” had just been published in book form\r\nby Howe & Bates, of 68 Chatham Street, New York. They purported to\r\nbe “a narrative of her sufferings during a residence of five years\r\nas a novice and two years as a black nun in the Hôtel Dieu Nunnery\r\nat Montreal.” On January 18, 1836, the _Sun_ began to publish these\r\nshocking stories, in somewhat condensed and expurgated form. It did\r\nnot vouch for their truth, but declared that it printed them from an\r\n“imperative sense of duty.” “We have no better means than are possessed\r\nby any reader,” it cautiously added, “to decide upon their truth or\r\nfalsehood.”\r\n\r\nThe “Disclosures” ran in the _Sun_ for ten days, during which time\r\nabout one-half of the book was printed. Maria Monk herself was in\r\nNew York, and so cleverly had she devised the imposture that she was\r\nreceived in good society as a martyr. Such was the public interest that\r\nit was estimated by Cardinal Manning, in 1851, that between two hundred\r\nand two hundred and fifty thousand copies of the volume were sold in\r\nAmerica and England. The Know-Nothing Party used it for political\r\ncapital, and anti-Catholic riots in several cities were the result of\r\nits publication.\r\n\r\nIts partial appearance in the _Sun_, while it may have helped the\r\ncirculation of the book, undoubtedly hastened the exposure of the\r\nfraud. The editor of the _Commercial Advertiser_, William Leete Stone,\r\nliked nothing better than to show up impostors. He had already written\r\na life of Matthias the Prophet, and he decided to get at the truth of\r\nMaria Monk’s revolting story.\r\n\r\nStone was at this time forty-four years old. He had been editor of\r\nthe Herkimer _American_, with Thurlow Weed as his journeyman; of the\r\n_Northern Whig_, of Hudson, New York; of the Albany _Daily Advertiser_,\r\nand of the Hartford _Mirror_. In 1821 he came to New York and succeeded\r\nZachariah Lewis as editor of the _Commercial Advertiser_. As a Mason\r\nhe had a controversy with John Quincy Adams, who was prominent in the\r\nanti-Masonic movement.\r\n\r\nStone was prominent politically. In 1825 he and Thurlow Weed\r\naccompanied Lafayette in his tour of the United States. In 1841\r\nPresident William Henry Harrison appointed him minister to The Hague,\r\nbut when Harrison died he was recalled by President Tyler. He was also\r\nthe first superintendent of the New York public schools--an office\r\nwhich he held at the time of his death, in 1844.\r\n\r\nStone went to Montreal, visited the Hôtel Dieu, and minutely compared\r\nthe details set down by the Monk woman in regard to the inmates of the\r\nnunnery and the plan of the building. The result of his investigation\r\nwas to establish the fact that the “Awful Disclosures” were fiction,\r\nand he exposed the impostor not only in his newspaper, but in his book,\r\n“Maria Monk and the Nunnery of the Hôtel Dieu.” The adherents of the\r\nwoman abused Stone roundly for this, and the general belief in her fake\r\nwas not entirely dissipated for years; not even after her own evil\r\nhistory was told, and after the Protestant residents of Montreal had\r\nheld a mass-meeting to denounce her. Maria Monk died in the city prison\r\nin New York fourteen years after she had created the most unpleasant\r\nscandal of the time.\r\n\r\nNews matters of a genuine kind diverted the types from Maria Monk.\r\nThere was the celebrated murder of Helen Jewett, a case in which Mr.\r\nBennett played detective with some success, and the Alamo massacre.\r\nCrockett, Bowie, and the rest of that band of heroes met their death on\r\nMarch 6, 1836, but the details did not reach New York for more than a\r\nmonth; it was April 12 when the _Sun_ gave a column to them.\r\n\r\nTexas and the Seminole War kept the news columns full until May 10,\r\nwhen Colonel Webb again pounced upon James Gordon Bennett. Said the\r\n_Sun_:\r\n\r\n    Upon calculating the number of public floggings which that\r\n    miserable scribbler, Bennett, has received, we have pretty\r\n    accurately ascertained that there is not a square inch of his\r\n    body which has not been lacerated somewhere about fifteen\r\n    times. In fact, he has become a common flogging property; and\r\n    Webb has announced his intention to cowskin him every Monday\r\n    morning until the Fourth of July, when he will offer him a\r\n    holiday. We understand that Webb has offered to remit the\r\n    flogging upon the condition that he will allow him to shoot\r\n    him; but Bennett says:\r\n\r\n    “No; skin for skin, behold, all that a man hath will he give\r\n    for his life!”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ beat the town on a great piece of news that spring.\r\n“Triumphant News from Texas! Santa Anna Captured!” the head-lines ran.\r\n\r\nThis appeared on May 18, four weeks after Sam Houston had taken the\r\nMexican president; but it was the first intimation New York had had of\r\nthe victory at San Jacinto.\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation of the murder of Helen Jewett and the trial\r\nof Richard P. Robinson, the suspect, the _Sun_ attacked Bennett for\r\nthe manner in which the _Herald_ handled the case. Bennett saw a good\r\nyellow story in the murder, for the house in which the murdered girl\r\nhad lived could not be said to be questionable; there was no doubt\r\nabout its character. Bennett’s interviewing of the victim’s associates\r\ndid not please the _Sun_, which pictured the unfortunate women “mobbed\r\nby several hundred vagabonds of all sizes and ages--amongst whom the\r\nlong, lank figure of the notorious Bennett was most conspicuous.”\r\n\r\nWhen it was not Bennett, it was Colonel Webb or one of his men. The\r\n_Sun_ went savagely after the proprietor of the _Courier and Enquirer_\r\nbecause he led the hissing at the Park Theatre against Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJoseph Wood, the English opera-singers. The offence of the Woods lay\r\nin giving a performance on an evening when a benefit was announced for\r\nMrs. Conduit, another popular vocalist. The town was divided upon the\r\nrow, but as the Woods and Mrs. Conduit were all English-born, it was\r\nnot a racial feud like the Macready-Forrest affair. The _Sun_ rebuked\r\nColonel Webb particularly because, after booing at the Woods, he had\r\nrefused Mr. Wood’s offer to have it out over pistols and coffee.\r\n\r\nWood was not a lily-finger. He had been plain Joe Wood, the pugilist,\r\nbefore he married the former Lady Lennox and embraced tenor song in\r\na serious way. Society rather took the part of the Woods, for after\r\nthe Park Theatre row a dinner in their compliment was arranged by\r\nHenry Ogden, Robert C. Wetmore, Duncan C. Pell, John P. Hone, Carroll\r\nLivingston, and other leading New Yorkers.\r\n\r\nThe fearlessness of the _Sun_ did not stop with saucing its\r\ncontemporaries. When Robinson was acquitted of the Jewett murder, after\r\na trial which the _Sun_ reported to the extent of nearly a page a day,\r\nthe _Sun_ editorially declared:\r\n\r\n    Our opinion, calmly and dispassionately formed from the\r\n    evidence, is that Richard P. Robinson is guilty of the wilful\r\n    and peculiarly atrocious murder of Helen Jewett.... Any\r\n    good-looking young man, possessing or being able to raise\r\n    among his friends the sum of fifteen hundred dollars to retain\r\n    Messrs. Maxwell, Price, and Hoffman for his counsel, might\r\n    murder any person he chose with perfect impunity.\r\n\r\nRobinson’s acquittal was credited largely to Ogden Hoffman, whose\r\nsumming up the _Sun_ described as “the most magnificent production of\r\nmind, eloquence, and rhetorical talent that ever resounded in a hall of\r\njustice.” This was the Ogden Hoffman of whom Decatur said, when Hoffman\r\nleft the navy in 1816, that he regretted that the young man should have\r\nexchanged “an honourable profession for that of a lawyer.” Hoffman\r\nand his partner Maxwell, who shared in this tremendous fee of fifteen\r\nhundred dollars, had been district attorneys of New York before the\r\ntime of the Jewett murder, and the _Sun_ inquired what would have been\r\nRobinson’s fate if Hoffman, and not Phenix, had been the prosecutor.\r\n\r\nOn August 20, 1836, the _Sun_ announced that its circulation averaged\r\ntwenty-seven thousand copies daily, or fifty-six hundred more than the\r\ncombined sale of the eleven six-cent papers. Of the penny papers the\r\nSun credited the _Herald_ with thirty-two hundred and the _Transcript_\r\nwith ten thousand, although both these rivals claimed at least twice\r\nas much. Columns were filled with the controversy which followed upon\r\nthe publication of these figures. The _Sun_ departed from a scholarly\r\nargument with the _Transcript_ over the pronunciation of “elegiac,” and\r\ndenounced it as a “nestle-tripe,” whatever that was.\r\n\r\nThere was a little room left for the news. Aaron Burr’s death got a\r\nstick; Marcy’s nomination for Governor of New York, an inch; Audubon’s\r\narrival in America, four lines. News that looks big now may not have\r\nseemed so imposing then, as this _Sun_ paragraph of September 22, 1836,\r\nwould show:\r\n\r\n    Two more States are already spoken of for addition to the\r\n    Union, under the names of Iowa and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nRichard Adams Locke left the _Sun_ in the fall of 1836, and on October\r\n6, in company with Joseph Price, started the _New Era_, a penny paper\r\nfor which the _Sun_ wished success. In less than a month, however,\r\nLocke and his former employer were quarrelling about the price of meals\r\nat the Astor House. That famous hotel was opened in May, 1836, with\r\nall New York marvelling at the wonders of its walnut furniture, so\r\nmuch nicer than the conventional mahogany! Before it was built, it was\r\nreferred to as the Park Hotel. When it opened it was called Astor’s\r\nHotel, but in a few months it came to be known by the name which stuck\r\nto it until it was abandoned in 1913.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our meal. Said Mr. Locke’s _New Era_:\r\n\r\n    A paragraph is going the rounds of the papers abusing the Astor\r\n    House. Nothing can be more groundless. Where the arrangements\r\n    are complete, the charges, of course, must be corresponding. We\r\n    suppose the report has been set afloat by some person who was\r\n    kicked out for not paying his bill.\r\n\r\nTo this horrid insinuation Day replied:\r\n\r\n    The report they speak of was set afloat by ourselves, after\r\n    paying $1.25 for a breakfast for a lady and her infant a year\r\n    and a half old, served just one hour and seven minutes after\r\n    it was ordered, with coffee black as ink and without milk, and\r\n    that, too, in a room so uncleanly as to be rather offensive.\r\n\r\nLocke wanted to make the _New Era_ another _Sun_, but he failed. His\r\nsecond hoax, “The Lost Manuscript of Mungo Park,” which purported to\r\ntell hitherto unrelated adventures of the Scottish explorer, fell down.\r\nThe public knew that the _New Era_ was edited by the author of the moon\r\nstory. When the _New Era_ died, Locke went to the Brooklyn _Eagle_,\r\njust founded, and he succeeded Henry C. Murphy, the proprietor and\r\nfirst editor, when that famous lawyer and writer was running for mayor\r\nof Brooklyn. Locke afterward was a custom-house employee. He died on\r\nStaten Island in 1871.\r\n\r\nSquabbling with his former friend Locke over hotel service was no\r\nsuch sport for Day as tilting at the owner of the _Herald_. The _Sun_\r\nattacked Bennett in the fall of 1836 for his attitude toward the\r\nHamblin benefit. Thomas Sowerby Hamblin was made bankrupt by the Bowery\r\nTheatre fire on September 22, for the great fires of the previous\r\nDecember had ruined practically all the fire-insurance companies of\r\nNew York, and there was not a policy on the theatre which this English\r\nactor-manager, with James H. Hackett, had made the leading playhouse\r\nof America. Hamblin did not like Bennett’s articles and the _Sun_ thus\r\nnoted the result of them:\r\n\r\n    Alas, poor Bennett! He seems destined to be flogged into\r\n    immortal fame, and become the common buffet-block of all\r\n    mankind. Mr. Hamblin paid him a complimentary visit last\r\n    evening [November 17] in his editorial closet and lathered\r\n    him all into lumps and blotches, although the living lie was\r\n    surrounded by his minions and had a brace of loaded pistols\r\n    lying on his desk when the outraged visitor first laid hands on\r\n    him.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Sun’s_ advertising business had increased until its income\r\nfrom that source was more than two hundred dollars a day, it bought\r\ntwo new presses of the Napier type from Robert Hoe, at a cost of seven\r\nthousand dollars. These enabled Mr. Day to run off thirty-two hundred\r\npapers an hour on each press. On the 2nd of January, 1837, the size\r\nof the _Sun_ was slightly increased, about an inch being added to the\r\nlength and width of each of its four pages.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1837, the price of flour rose from the normal of about\r\n$5.50 a barrel to double that amount. The _Sun_ declared that the\r\nincrease was not natural, but rather the result of a combination--a\r\nsuspicion which seems to have been shared by a large number of\r\ncitizens. The bread riots of February 13 and later were the result of\r\nan agitation for lower prices.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of Commerce_ denounced the _Sun_ as an inciter of the\r\nriots, and suggested that the grand jury should direct its attention\r\ntoward Mr. Day. The _Sun_ not only refused to recede from its stand,\r\nbut suggested that the foreman of the grand jury, the famous Philip\r\nHone, had himself incited a riot--the riot against the Abolitionists,\r\nJuly 11, 1834--which had a less worthy purpose than the _Sun’s_ stand\r\non the matter of flour prices. The _Sun_ was virtuously indignant,\r\neven more than it had been a short time before, when the Transcript\r\ncharged the _Sun’s_ circulation man, Mr. Young, with biting two of the\r\n_Transcript’s_ carriers!\r\n\r\nThe beginning of regular transatlantic steamship service did not find\r\nin the _Sun_ a completely joyous welcome--thanks, perhaps, to the\r\ntemperament of Lieutenant Hosken, R.N. He was an officer of the Great\r\nWestern, a side-wheeler of no less than thirteen hundred and forty\r\ntons, with paddles twenty-eight feet in diameter. This new ship, built\r\nat Bristol, and a marvel of its time, reached New York, April 23, 1838,\r\nafter a passage of only sixteen days! The Sirius, another new vessel,\r\ngot in a few hours ahead of the Great Western, after a voyage of\r\neighteen days. The _Sun_ said of this double event:\r\n\r\n    Of the conduct of the officers in command of the Great Western,\r\n    we regret that we are compelled by reports to place it in no\r\n    very favorable contrast with the gentlemanly demeanor of the\r\n    officers of the Sirius. Every attention has been paid her,\r\n    citizens have turned out to welcome her arrival, she was\r\n    saluted by the battery on Ellis’s Island, _et cetera, et\r\n    cetera_, and thousands of other demonstrations of courtesy\r\n    were made, which proved only throwing pearls before swine.\r\n    A news boat was ordered to keep off or be run down, and\r\n    the hails of that boat and others were answered through a\r\n    speaking-trumpet in a manner which would have done toward the\r\n    savage of Nootka Sound, but is not exactly the style in which\r\n    to meet the courtesies of members of a community upon which\r\n    the line of packets depends in a large part for success. One\r\n    would have thought that all the impudence of Europe was put\r\n    on board a vessel built of large tonnage expressly for its\r\n    embarkation. By the time our corporation officers have run the\r\n    suspender-buttons off their breeches in chase of Lieutenant\r\n    Hosken, R. N., they will discover that they have been fools for\r\n    their pains.\r\n\r\n    Reverse this account entirely, and it will apply to the\r\n    Sirius--testimony which we are happy to make.\r\n\r\nSo the _Sun_ was not obsequiously grateful for the arrival of a ship\r\nwhose speed enabled it to announce on April 24 that Queen Victoria had\r\nissued, on the 6th, the proclamation of the details of her coronation\r\nat Westminster on June 26, and that O’Connell was taking steps to\r\nremove the civil disabilities from the Jews.\r\n\r\nAll this time the _Sun_ was not neglecting the minor local happenings\r\nabout which its patrons liked to read. The police-courts, the theatres,\r\nand the little scandals had their column or two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nNEW YORK LIFE IN THE THIRTIES\r\n\r\n  _A Sprightly City Which Daily Bought Thirty Thousand Copies of “The\r\n    Sun.”--The Rush to Start Penny Papers.--Day Sells “The Sun” for\r\n    Forty Thousand Dollars._\r\n\r\n\r\nNo dull city, that New York of Ben Day’s time! Almost a dozen theatres\r\nof the first class were running. The Bowery, the first playhouse in\r\nAmerica to have a stage lighted with gas, had already been twice burned\r\nand rebuilt. The Park, which saw the American début of Macready, Edwin\r\nForrest, and James H. Hackett, was offering such actors as Charles\r\nKean, Charles and Fanny Kemble, Charles Mathews, Sol Smith, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Joseph Wood, and Master Joseph Burke, the Irish Roscius. Forrest,\r\nthen talked of as a candidate for Congress, was the favourite of New\r\nYork. On his appearance, said a _Sun_ review of his acting in “King\r\nLear,” the audience uttered “the roar of seven thunders.”\r\n\r\nThere was vaudeville to be enjoyed at Niblo’s Garden, a circus at\r\nVauxhall Garden. Drama held the boards at the Olympic and the National.\r\nThe Franklin was one of the new theatres. It was in Chatham Street,\r\nbetween James and Oliver, and it was there that Barney Williams,\r\nthe _Sun’s_ pioneer newsboy, made his first stage appearance, as a\r\njig-dancer, when he was about fifteen years old.\r\n\r\nCharlotte Cushman, Hackett, Forrest, and Sol Smith were the leading\r\nAmerican actors of that day, although Junius Brutus Booth had achieved\r\nsome prominence. Edwin Booth, Joseph Jefferson, William J. Florence,\r\nand Maggie Mitchell were children, all a little older than the _Sun_.\r\nJohn T. Raymond was born at Buffalo in 1836, John E. McCullough in\r\nIreland the next year, and Lawrence Barrett at Paterson, New Jersey, in\r\n1838.\r\n\r\nThe hotels were temples of plenty. English travellers, going to the new\r\nAstor, the American, Niblo’s, or the New York House, recoiled in horror\r\nat the appetite of the Yankee. At breakfast they saw the untutored\r\nAmerican break two or three boiled eggs into a tumbler and eat them\r\ntherefrom--and then they wrote letters to the London _Times_ about\r\nit. At dinner, served in the hotels about noon--three o’clock was the\r\nfashionable hour in private houses--the hungry New Yorker, including\r\nMr. Day and his brother-in-law, Mr. Beach, would sit down to roast\r\nbeef, venison, prairie-chicken, and a half-dozen vegetables. Bottles of\r\nbrandy stood in the centre of the table for him who would; surely not\r\nfor Mr. Day, who printed daily pieces about the effects of strong drink!\r\n\r\nThere was gambling on Park Row--Chatham Row, it was called then--games\r\nin the Elysian Fields of Hoboken on Sundays, and duels there on\r\nweek-days; picnickings in the woods about where the Ritz-Carlton stands\r\nto-day; horse-racing on the Boulevard, now upper Broadway, and rowing\r\nraces on the Harlem. Those who liked thoroughbred racing went to the\r\nUnion Course on Long Island, or to Saratoga.\r\n\r\nClub life was young. Cooper, Halleck, Bryant, and other literary moguls\r\nhad started the Bread and Cheese Club in 1824. The Hone Club, named for\r\nMayor Hone, sprang up in 1836, and gave dinners for Daniel Webster,\r\nWilliam H. Seward, and other great Whigs. In that same year the Union\r\nClub was founded--the oldest New York club that is still in existence.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ was not as popular in the clubs as it is to-day. A clubman of\r\n1837 caught reading any newspaper except the _Courier and Enquirer_,\r\nthe _Evening Post_, or one of their like, would have been frowned upon\r\nby his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ found plenty to print.\r\n\r\n“We write,” it boasted, “more original editorial matter than any other\r\npaper in the city, great or small.”\r\n\r\nIt poked with its paragraphs at the shinplaster, that small form of\r\ncurrency issued by private bankers. It made fun of phrenology, then one\r\nof the fads. It jeered at animal magnetism, another craze. It had the\r\nPapineau rebellion, the Patriot War, Indian uprisings, and the belated\r\nnews from Europe. It printed extracts from the “Pickwick Papers.”\r\nDickens was all the rage.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ comment on “Nicholas Nickleby,” when Dickens’s fourth book\r\nreached New York in 1838, was that it was as well written as “Oliver\r\nTwist,” and “not so gloomy.” Yet the grimness of the earlier novel had\r\na fascination for the youth of that day. It was this book, read by\r\ncandle-light after the store was closed, that so weakened the eyes of\r\nCharles A. Dana--still clerking in Buffalo--that he believed he would\r\nhave to become a farmer.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ did not mention, in its report of the Patriot War, that Dana\r\nwas a member of the Home Guard in Buffalo, and had ideas of enlisting\r\nas a regular soldier. The _Sun_ did not know of the youth’s existence;\r\nnor is it likely that he read Mr. Day’s paper.\r\n\r\nA piece of “newspaper news” was printed in the _Sun_ of June 1, 1837--a\r\ndescription of the first so-called endless paper roll in operation. Day\r\nstill printed on small, flat sheets, but evidently he was impressed\r\nwith the novelty. The touch about the rag-mill, of course, was fiction:\r\n\r\n    We have been shown a sheet of paper about a hundred feet in\r\n    length and two feet wide, printed on both sides by a machine at\r\n    one operation. This extraordinary invention enables a person\r\n    to print off any length of paper required for any number of\r\n    copies of a work or a public journal without a single stop, and\r\n    without the assistance of any person except one to put in the\r\n    rags at the extremity of the machine.\r\n\r\n    This wonderful operation is effected by the placing of the\r\n    types on stereotype plates on the surface of two cylinders,\r\n    which are connected with the paper-making machinery. The paper,\r\n    as it issues from the mill, enters in a properly moistened\r\n    state between the rollers, which are evenly inked by an\r\n    ingenious apparatus, and emerges in a printed form. The number\r\n    of copies can be measured off by the yard or mile. The work\r\n    which we have seen from this press is “Robinson Crusoe,” and\r\n    consists of one hundred and sixty duodecimo pages.\r\n\r\n    The Bible could be printed off and almost disseminated among\r\n    the Indians in one continuous stream of living truth. The _Sun_\r\n    would occupy a roll about seven feet in diameter, and our issue\r\n    to Boston, Philadelphia, and other cities would be not far from\r\n    a quarter of a mile long, each. The two cents postage on this\r\n    would be but a trifle. The whole length of our paper would be\r\n    about seventy-seven thousand feet, a papyrus which it must be\r\n    confessed it would take Lord Brougham a longer time to unroll\r\n    than the vitrified scrolls of Herculaneum and Pompeii.\r\n\r\n    All that it is necessary for a man to do on going into a\r\n    paper-mill is to take off his shirt, hand it to the devil who\r\n    officiates at one extremity, and have it come out “Robinson\r\n    Crusoe” at the other. We should like to exchange some of our\r\n    old shirts in this way, as we cannot afford the expense, during\r\n    these hard times, of getting them washed.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Thomas French, the inventor, is from Ithaca, and is now\r\n    in this city. He has one roll about six inches in diameter\r\n    which is six hundred feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_From a Picture in the Possession of Mrs. Jennie Beach\r\nGasper_)\r\n\r\n  MOSES YALE BEACH, SECOND OWNER OF “THE SUN”]\r\n\r\nNo display advertising was printed in the _Sun_ of those years, but\r\nthere was a variety of “liners.” These were adorned with tiny cuts\r\nof ships, shoes, horses, cows, hats, dogs, clocks, and what not. For\r\nexample--\r\n\r\n    Came to the premises of F. Reville, Gardener, on the 16th\r\n    inst., a COW, which has since calved.

Here are two other advertisements characteristic of\r\nthe time:\r\n\r\n    A CARD--TO BUTCHERS--Mr. Stamler, having retired to private\r\n    life, would be glad to see his friends, the Butchers, at his\r\n    house, No. 5 Rivington Street, this afternoon, between the\r\n    hours of 2 and 5 P.M., to partake of a collation.\r\n\r\n    SIX CENTS REWARD!--Run away from the subscriber, on the 30th\r\n    of May, Charles Eldridge, an indented apprentice to the\r\n    Segar-Making business, about 16 years of age, 4 feet high,\r\n    broken back. Had on, when he left, a round jacket and blue\r\n    pantaloons. The above reward and no charges will be paid for\r\n    his delivery to\r\n\r\n                                        JOHN DIBBEN, No. 354 Bowery.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 1837, the name of Benjamin H. Day, which had appeared at\r\nthe masthead of the _Sun_ since its beginning, disappeared. In its\r\nplace was the legend: “Published daily by the proprietor.” This gave\r\nrise to a variety of rumours, and about a week later, on June 23, the\r\n_Sun_ said editorially:\r\n\r\n    Several of our contemporaries are in a maze of wonder because\r\n    we have taken our beautiful cognomen from the imprint of the\r\n    _Sun_. Some of the loafers among them have even flattered\r\n    themselves that our humble self in person had consequently\r\n    disappeared. Not so, gentlemen--for though we may not be\r\n    ambitious that our thirty thousand subscribers should daily\r\n    pronounce our name while poring over advertisements on the\r\n    first page, we nevertheless remain steadily at our post, and\r\n    shall thus continue during the pleasure of a generous public,\r\n    except, perchance, an absence of a few months on a trip to\r\n    Europe, which we purpose to make this season.\r\n\r\n    With regard to a certain report that we had lost twenty\r\n    thousand dollars by shaving notes, we have nothing to say. Our\r\n    private business transactions cannot in the least interest the\r\n    public at large.\r\n\r\nDay’s name never went back. The reason for its disappearance was a\r\nlibel-suit brought by a lawyer named Andrew S. Garr. On May 3, 1837,\r\nthe _Sun_ printed a report of a case in the Court of Chancery, in which\r\nit was incidentally mentioned that Garr had once been indicted for\r\nconspiracy to defraud. The reporter neglected to add that Garr had been\r\nacquitted. At the end of the article was the quotation:\r\n\r\n    When rogues get quarreling, the truth will out.\r\n\r\nGarr sued Day for ten thousand dollars, and Day not only took his name\r\nfrom the top of the first column of the first page, but apparently made\r\na wash sale of the newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe case was tried in February, 1838, and on the 16th of that month\r\nGarr got a verdict for three thousand dollars--“to be extracted,” as\r\nthe _Sun_ said next morning, “from the right-hand breeches-pocket\r\nof the defendant, who about a year since ceased replenishing that\r\nfountain of the ‘needful’ from the prolific source of the _Sun’s_ rays\r\nby virtue of a total, unconditional, and unrevisionary sale of the same\r\nto its present proprietor.”\r\n\r\nThe name of that “present proprietor” was not given; but on June 28,\r\n1838, the following notice appeared at the top of the first page:\r\n\r\n    Communications intended for the _Sun_ must be addressed to\r\n    Moses Y. Beach, 156 Nassau Street, corner of Spruce.\r\n\r\nDay was really out of the _Sun_ then, after having been its master for\r\nfive years lacking sixty-seven days, and the paper passed into the\r\nactual ownership of Beach, who had married Day’s sister, and who had\r\nacted as the bookkeeper of the _Sun_ almost from its inception. There\r\nwere those, including Edgar Allan Poe, who believed that Beach was the\r\nboss of the _Sun_ even in the days of the moon hoax, but they were\r\nmistaken. The paper, as the _Sun_ itself remarked on December 4, 1835,\r\nwas “altogether ruled by Benjamin H. Day.”\r\n\r\n“I owned the whole concern,” said Mr. Day in 1883, “till I sold it to\r\nBeach. And the silliest thing I ever did in my life was to sell that\r\npaper!”\r\n\r\nAnd why did Day sell, for forty thousand dollars, a paper which had the\r\nlargest circulation in the world--about thirty thousand copies? The\r\nanswer is that it was not paying as well as it had paid.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of years when his profits had been as high as\r\ntwenty thousand dollars. The net return for the six months ending\r\nOctober 1, 1836, as announced by the _Sun_ on April 19, 1837, was\r\n$12,981.88; but at the time when Day sold out, the _Sun_ was about\r\nbreaking even. The advertising, due to general dulness in business--for\r\nwhich the bank failures and the big fire were partly to blame--had\r\nfallen off. It was costing Day three hundred dollars a week more\r\nfor operating expenses and materials than he got for the sales of\r\nnewspapers, and this loss was barely made up by the advertising\r\nreceipts. With what he had saved, and the forty thousand paid to him by\r\nBeach, he would have a comfortable fortune. He was only twenty-eight\r\nyears old, and there might be other worlds to conquer.\r\n\r\nFrom nothing at all except his own industry and common sense Day had\r\nbuilt up an enterprise which the _Sun_ itself thus described a few days\r\nbefore the change of ownership:\r\n\r\n    Some idea of the business done in the little three-story\r\n    building at the corner of Nassau and Spruce Streets occupied by\r\n    the _Sun_ for the publication of a penny paper may be formed\r\n    from the fact that the annual outlay for material and wages\r\n    exceeds ninety-three thousand dollars--very nearly two thousand\r\n    a week, and more than three hundred a day for the six working\r\n    days. On this outlay we circulate daily thirty thousand papers.\r\n    Allowing the other nine morning papers an average of three\r\n    thousand circulation--which may fall short in two or three\r\n    cases, while it is a large estimate for all the rest--it will\r\n    appear that the circulation of the _Sun_ newspaper is daily\r\n    more than of all the others united.\r\n\r\n    That this is not mere gasconade, but susceptible of proof, we\r\n    refer the curious to the paper-makers who furnish the stock for\r\n    this immense circulation; to the type-founders who give us a\r\n    new dress three times a year, and to the Messrs. Hoe & Co., who\r\n    built our two double-cylinder Napier presses, which throw off\r\n    copies of the _Sun_ at the rate of four thousand per hour. We\r\n    invite newspaper publishers to visit our establishment when the\r\n    presses are in operation, and we shall be happy to show them\r\n    what would have astonished Dr. Faust, with all his intimacy\r\n    with a certain _nil admirari_ potentate.\r\n\r\nAs for the influence of the paper among the people, the _Sun_ dealt\r\nin no vain exaggeration when it said of itself, a year before Day’s\r\ndeparture:\r\n\r\n    Since the _Sun_ began to shine upon the citizens of New\r\n    York there has been a very great and decided change in the\r\n    condition of the laboring classes and the mechanics. Now every\r\n    individual, from the rich aristocrat who lolls in his carriage\r\n    to the humble laborer who wields a broom in the streets, reads\r\n    the _Sun_; nor can even a boy be found in New York City or the\r\n    neighboring country who will not know in the course of the day\r\n    what is promulgated in the _Sun_ in the morning.\r\n\r\n    Already can we perceive a change in the mass of the people.\r\n    They think, talk, and act in concert. They understand their\r\n    own interest, and feel that they have numbers and strength to\r\n    pursue it with success.\r\n\r\n    The _Sun_ newspaper has probably done more to benefit the\r\n    community by enlightening the minds of the common people than\r\n    all the other papers together.\r\n\r\nDay found New York journalism a pot of cold, stale water, and left it\r\na boiling caldron; not so much by what he wrote as by the way in which\r\nhe made his success. There were better newspapermen than Day before and\r\nduring his time, plenty of them. They had knowledge and experience,\r\nthey knew style, but they did not know the people. In their imagination\r\nthe “gentle reader” was a male between the ages of thirty-five and\r\nninety, with a burning interest in politics, and a fancy that the\r\nuniverse revolved around either Andrew Jackson or Daniel Webster. Why\r\nwrite for any one who did not have fixed notions on the subject of the\r\nUnited States Bank or Abolition?\r\n\r\nTo the mind of the sixpenny editor, the man who did not have six cents\r\nto spend was a negligible quantity. Nothing was worth printing unless\r\nit carried an appeal to the professional man or the merchant.\r\n\r\nThe _Courier and Enquirer_, under Colonel Webb, belched broadsides of\r\nold-fashioned Democratic doctrine, and Webb hired the best men he could\r\nfind to load the guns. He had Bennett, Noah, James K. Paulding, and,\r\nlater, Charles King and Henry J. Raymond. These were all good writers,\r\nmost of them good newspapermen; but so far as the general public was\r\nconcerned, Colonel Webb might as well have put them in a cage.\r\n\r\nThe _Journal of Commerce_ was a great sixpenny, but it was not for the\r\npeople to read. From 1828 until the Civil War its editor was Gerard\r\nHallock, an enterprising journalist who ran expensive horse-expresses\r\nto Washington to get the proceedings of Congress, but would not admit\r\nthat the public at large was more interested in a description of\r\nthe murdered Helen Jewett’s gowns than in a new currency bill. The\r\nclipper-ships that lay off Sandy Hook to get the latest foreign news\r\nfrom the European vessels cost Hallock and Webb, who combined in this\r\nenterprise, twenty thousand dollars a year--probably more than they\r\nspent on all their local news.\r\n\r\nIn the solemn sanctum of the _Evening Post_, William Cullen Bryant\r\nand William Leggett wrote scholarly verse and free-trade editorials.\r\nThey were live men, but their newspaper steed was slow. Leggett could\r\nurge Bryant to give a beating to Stone, the editor of the _Commercial\r\nAdvertiser_, and he himself fought a duel with Blake, the treasurer of\r\nthe Park Theatre; but these great men had little steam when it came\r\nto making a popular newspaper. The great editors were of a cult. They\r\nrevolved around one another, too far aloft for the common eye.\r\n\r\nCharles King was the most conservative of them all. He was a son of\r\nRufus King, Senator from New York and minister to England, and he was\r\neditor of the _American_, an evening sixpenny, from 1827 to 1845.\r\nHe lacked nothing in scholarship, but his paper was miserably dull,\r\nand rarely circulated more than a thousand copies. He remained at his\r\neditorial desk for four years after the _American_ was absorbed by\r\nthe _Courier and Enquirer_, and then he became president of Columbia\r\nCollege, a place better suited to him.\r\n\r\nSuch were the men who ruled the staid, prosy, and expensive newspapers\r\nof New York when Day and his penny _Sun_ popped up. Most of them are\r\nbetter known to fame than Day is, but not one of them did anything\r\ncomparable to the young printer’s achievement in making a popular,\r\nlow-priced daily newspaper--and not only making it, but making it\r\nstick. For Day started something that went rolling on, increasing in\r\nsize and weight until it controlled the thought of the continent.\r\nDay was the Columbus, the _Sun_ was the egg. Anybody could do the\r\ntrick--after Day showed how simple it was.\r\n\r\nBennett and his _Herald_ were the first to profit by the example of the\r\nyoung Yankee printer. It should have been easy for Bennett, yet he had\r\nalready failed at the same undertaking. He was at work in the newspaper\r\nfield of New York as early as 1824, nine years before Day started the\r\n_Sun_. He failed as proprietor of the Sunday _Courier_ (1825), and he\r\nfailed again with the Philadelphia _Pennsylvanian_. He had a wealth of\r\nexperience as assistant to Webb and as the Washington correspondent of\r\nthe _Enquirer_.\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt due to the success of the _Sun_ that Bennett, after two\r\nfailures, established the _Herald_. He saw the human note that Ben Day\r\nhad struck, and he knew, as a comparatively old newspaperman--he was\r\nforty when he started the _Herald_--what mistakes Day was making in the\r\nneglect of certain news fields, such as Wall Street. But the value of\r\nthe penny paper Day had already proved, and Day had established, ahead\r\nof everybody else, the newsboy system, by which the man in the street\r\ncould get a paper whenever he liked without making a yearly investment.\r\n\r\nBennett may have written the constitution of popular journalism, but\r\nit was Day who wrote its declaration of independence. If it had not\r\nbeen for the untrained Day, fifteen years younger than Bennett, it\r\nis possible that there would have been no _Herald_ to span nearly a\r\ncentury under the ownership of father and son; and the two James Gordon\r\nBennetts not only owned but absolutely _were_ the _Herald_ from May 10,\r\n1835, when the father started the paper, until May 14, 1918, when the\r\nson died.\r\n\r\nIt had been said of Bennett that he discovered that “a paper\r\nuniversally denounced will be read.” Day learned that much a year\r\nbefore the _Herald_ was started. Day was sensational, and he seemed\r\nto court the written assaults of the sixpenny editors. Bennett also\r\nsought abuse, and did not care when it brought physical pain with it.\r\nHe was still more sensational than Day. If there was nothing else, his\r\nown personal affairs were made the public’s property. He was about to\r\nmarry, so the _Herald_ printed this:\r\n\r\n    TO THE READERS OF THE HERALD--Declaration of Love--Caught at\r\n    Last--Going to be Married--New Movement in Civilization.\r\n\r\n    My ardent desire has been through life to reach the highest\r\n    order of human excellence by the shortest possible cut.\r\n    Association, night and day, in sickness and in health, in war\r\n    and in peace, with a woman of the highest order of excellence\r\n    must produce some curious results in my heart and feelings,\r\n    and these results the future will develop in due time in the\r\n    columns of the _Herald_. Meantime I return my heartfelt thanks\r\n    for the enthusiastic patronage of the public, both of Europe\r\n    and of America. The holy estate of wedlock will only increase\r\n    my desire to be still more useful. God Almighty bless you\r\n    all--JAMES GORDON BENNETT.\r\n\r\nJames Parton described Bennett as “a man of French intellect and Scotch\r\nhabits.” Bennett was not of Scottish blood, his parents being of\r\nFrench descent, but his youth in Scotland, where he was born, probably\r\nimpregnated him with the thrift of his environment. He established\r\nthe no-credit system in the _Herald_ business office. Probably he had\r\nobserved that Colonel Webb had lost a fortune in unpaid subscriptions\r\nand advertisements.\r\n\r\nBennett was a good business man and an energetic editor. He used all\r\nthe ideas that Day had proved profitable, and many of his own. Perhaps\r\nthe most valuable thing he learned from Day was that it was unwise\r\nto be a slave to a political party. But his own experience with the\r\nluckless _Pennsylvanian_, a Jackson organ, may have convinced him of\r\nthe futility of the strictly partisan papers, which neglected the news\r\nfor the sake of the office-holders.\r\n\r\nDay’s success with the _Sun_ was responsible for the birth, not only\r\nof the _Herald_, but of a host of American penny papers, which were\r\nestablished at the rate of a dozen a year. Of the New York imitators\r\nthe _Jeffersonian_, published by Childs & Devoe, and the _Man_,\r\nowned by George H. Evans, an Englishman who was the Henry George of\r\nhis day, were not long for this world. The _Transcript_, started in\r\n1834, flashed up for a time as a dangerous rival of the _Sun_. Three\r\ncompositors, William J. Stanley, Willoughby Lynde, and Billings\r\nHayward, owned it. Its editor was Asa Greene, erstwhile physician\r\nand bookseller and always humorist. He wrote “The Adventures of Dr.\r\nDodimus Duckworth,” “The Perils of Pearl Street,” and “The Travels of\r\nEx-Barber Fribbleton in America”--this last a travesty on the books of\r\ntravel turned out by Englishmen who visited the States.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Attree, a former compositor, wrote the _Transcript’s_\r\nlively police-court stories, the _Sun’s_ rival having learned how\r\npopular was crime. The _Transcript_ lasted five years, the earlier of\r\nthem so prosperous that the proprietors thought they were going to be\r\nmillionaires. But Reporter Attree went to Texas with the land-boomers,\r\nand Lynde, who wrote the paragraphs, died. When the paper failed, in\r\n1839, Hayward went to the _Herald_, where he worked as a compositor all\r\nthe rest of his life.\r\n\r\nThe other penny papers that sprang up in New York to give battle--while\r\nthe money lasted--to the _Sun_, the _Transcript_, and the _Herald_,\r\nwere the _True Sun_, started by some of Day’s discharged employees;\r\nthe _Morning Star_, run by Major Noah, of the _Evening Star_; the _New\r\nEra_, already mentioned, which Richard Adams Locke started in 1836\r\nin company with Jared D. Bell and Joseph Price; the _Daily Whig_, of\r\nwhich Horace Greeley was Albany correspondent in 1838; the _Bee_, the\r\n_Serpent_, the _Light_, the _Express_, the _Union_, the _Rough Hewer_,\r\nthe _News Times_, the _Examiner_, the _Morning Chronicle_, the _Evening\r\nChronicle_, the _Daily Conservative_, the _Censor_, and the _Daily\r\nNews_. All these bobbed up, in one city alone, in the five years during\r\nwhich Ben Day owned the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nMost of them were mushrooms in origin and morning-glories by nature.\r\nThey could not stand the _Sun’s_ rays.\r\n\r\nNotable exceptions were two evening papers, the _Express_ and the\r\n_Daily News_. The _Express_ was established in June, 1836, under the\r\neditorship of James Brooks and his brother Erastus, graduates of the\r\n_Advertiser_, of Portland, Maine. It was devoted to Whig politics and\r\nthe shipping of New York. The _Daily News_ took no considerable part in\r\njournalism until twenty-five years later, when Benjamin Wood bought it.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the country the one-cent newspaper, properly\r\nconducted, met with the favour which the public had showered upon Ben\r\nDay. William M. Swain, who has been mentioned as a fellow compositor\r\nwith Ben Day, and who tried to dissuade his friend from the folly\r\nof starting the _Sun_, saw the wisdom of the penny paper, and saw,\r\nalso, that the New York field was filled. He went to Philadelphia and\r\nestablished the _Public Ledger_, the first issue appearing on March 25,\r\n1836. The _Ledger_ was not the first penny sheet to be published in\r\nPhiladelphia, the _Daily Transcript_ having preceded it by a few days.\r\nThese two newspapers soon consolidated, however.\r\n\r\nSwain’s _Ledger_ was at once sensational and brave. It came out for\r\nthe abolition of slavery, and its office was twice mobbed. It was\r\nmobbed again in 1844, during the Native American riots. Swain was a\r\nbig, hard-working man. George W. Childs, his successor as proprietor\r\nof the _Ledger_, wrote of him that for twenty years it was his habit\r\nto read every paragraph that went into the paper. Swain made three\r\nmillion dollars out of the _Ledger_; but when, during the Civil War,\r\nthe cost of paper compelled nearly all the newspapers to advance\r\nprices, he tried to keep the _Ledger_ at one cent, and lost a hundred\r\nthousand dollars within a year. Childs, who had been a newsdealer and\r\nbook-publisher, bought the paper from Swain in 1864, and raised its\r\nprice to two cents.\r\n\r\nWhen Swain went to Philadelphia he had two partners, Arunah S. Abell\r\nand Azariah H. Simmons, both printers, and, like Swain, former\r\nassociates of Day. Simmons remained with Swain on the _Ledger_ until\r\nhis death in 1855, but Abell--the man who poked more fun than anybody\r\nelse at Day for his penny _Sun_ idea--went to Baltimore and there\r\nestablished a _Sun_ of his own, the first copy coming out on May 17,\r\n1837. It was a success from the start. How well it paid Abell to follow\r\nBen Day’s scheme may be judged by the fact that thirty years later\r\nAbell bought Guilford, a splendid estate near Baltimore, and paid\r\n$475,000 for it.\r\n\r\nBoth Swain and Abell were friends of S. F. B. Morse, and they helped\r\nhim to finance the electric telegraph. The Baltimore _Sun_ published\r\nthe famous message--“What hath God wrought?”--sent over the wire from\r\nWashington to Baltimore on May 24, 1844, when the telegraph first came\r\ninto practical use. Abell was the sole proprietor of the Baltimore\r\n_Sun_ from 1837 to 1887. He died in 1888 at the age of eighty-two.\r\n\r\nOther important newspapers started in the ten years that followed Day’s\r\nfounding of the _Sun_ were the Detroit _Free Press_, the St. Louis\r\n_Republic_, the New Orleans _Picayune_, the Burlington _Hawkeye_, the\r\nHartford _Times_, the New York _Tribune_, the Brooklyn _Eagle_, the\r\nCincinnati _Enquirer_, and the Cleveland _Plain Dealer_.\r\n\r\nIn 1830 there were only 852 newspapers in the United States, which then\r\nhad a population of 12,866,020, and these newspapers had a combined\r\nyearly circulation of 68,117,000 copies. Ten years later the population\r\nwas 17,069,453, and there were 1,631 newspapers with a combined yearly\r\ncirculation of 196,000,000 copies. In other words, while the population\r\nincreased 32 per cent. in a decade, the total sale of newspapers\r\nincreased 187 per cent. The inexpensive paper had found its readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AN EXTRA OF “THE SUN”\r\n    These Special Editions Were Issued on the Arrival of Every Mail\r\n    Ship from England.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE THIRD HOME OF “THE SUN”\r\n    Beach and Bennett, Rival Publishers, Had Offices Opposite Each\r\n    Other at Fulton and Nassau Streets.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn his report on newspapers for the Census of 1880, S. N. D. North says\r\nthat from 1830 to 1840--\r\n\r\n    By the sheer force of its superior circulation, the penny press\r\n    exerted the most powerful newspaper influence that was felt\r\n    in the United States, and during this interval its beneficial\r\n    influence was the most apparent. It taught the higher-priced\r\n    papers that political connection was properly subordinated\r\n    to the other and higher function of the public journal--the\r\n    function of gathering and presenting the news as it is, without\r\n    reference to its political or other effect upon friend or foe.\r\n\r\n    The advent of the penny press concluded the transition period\r\n    in American journalism, and had three effects which are\r\n    easily traceable. It increased the circulation, decreased the\r\n    price of daily newspapers, and changed the character of the\r\n    reading-matter published.\r\n\r\nAs Charles H. Levermore wrote in an article on the rise of metropolitan\r\njournalism in the _American Historical Review_:\r\n\r\n    Independent journalism, as represented first by the _Sun_\r\n    and the _Herald_, won a complete victory over old-fashioned\r\n    partizan journalism. The time had forever departed when an\r\n    Albany regency could tune the press of the State as easily and\r\n    simply as Queen Elizabeth used to tune the English pulpits. As\r\n    James Parton said, “An editorial is only a man speaking to men;\r\n    but the news is Providence speaking to men.”\r\n\r\nThus Ben Day’s _Sun_ remade American journalism--more by accident than\r\ndesign, as he himself remarked at a dinner to Robert Hoe in 1851.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Day soon regretted the sale of the _Sun_, for in\r\n1840 he established a penny paper called the _True Sun_. This he\r\npresently sold for a fair price, but his itch for journalism did not\r\ndisappear. He started the _Tatler_, but it was not a success. In 1842,\r\nin conjunction with James Wilson, he founded the monthly magazine,\r\n_Brother Jonathan_, which reprinted English double-decker novels\r\ncomplete in one issue. This later became a weekly, and Day brought out\r\nillustrated editions semi-annually.\r\n\r\nThis was a new thing, at least in America, and Day may be called the\r\noriginator of our illustrated periodicals as well as of our penny\r\npapers. His right-hand men in the editing of _Brother Jonathan_ were\r\nNathaniel P. Willis, the poet, and Horatio H. Weld, who was first a\r\nprinter, next an editor, and at last a minister.\r\n\r\nDay sold _Brother Jonathan_ for a dollar a year. When the paper famine\r\nhit the publishing business in 1862, he suspended his publication and\r\nretired from business. He was well off, and he spent the remaining\r\ntwenty-seven years of his life in ease at his New York home. He died\r\non December 21, 1889. His son Benjamin was the inventor of the Ben Day\r\nprocess used in making engravings.\r\n\r\nDay always watched the fortunes of the _Sun_ with interest, but he\r\ndid not believe that his immediate successors ran it just the right\r\nway. When the paper passed into the hands of Charles A. Dana, in 1868,\r\nDay--then not yet threescore--said:\r\n\r\n“He’ll make a newspaper of it!”\r\n\r\nAnd it was then he added that the silliest thing he himself ever did\r\nwas to sell the _Sun_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMOSES Y. BEACH’S ERA OF HUSTLE\r\n\r\n  _“The Sun” Uses Albany Steamboats, Horse Expresses, Trotting Teams,\r\n    Pigeons, and the Telegraph to Get News.--Poe’s Famous Balloon\r\n    Hoax and the Case of Mary Rogers._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second owner of the _Sun_, Moses Yale Beach, was, like Ben Day,\r\na Yankee. He was born in the old Connecticut town of Wallingford on\r\nJanuary 7, 1800. He had a little education in the common schools, but\r\nshowed more interest in mechanics than in books. When he was fourteen\r\nhe was bound out to a cabinet-maker in Hartford. His skill was so fine\r\nthat he saw the needlessness of serving the customary seven years, and\r\nhis industry so great that he was able, by doing extra work in odd\r\ntimes, to get together enough money to buy his freedom from his master.\r\nHe set up a cabinet-shop of his own at Northampton, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nWhen Beach was twenty, he made the acquaintance of Miss Nancy Day,\r\nof Springfield, the sister of Benjamin was the inventor of the Ben\r\nDay process used in Day were married in 1821, and as the business at\r\nNorthampton was not prospering, they settled down in Springfield.\r\n\r\nThe young man was a good cabinet-maker, but his mind ran to inventions\r\nrather than to chests and high-boys. Steamboat navigation had not\r\nyet attained a commercial success, but Beach was a close student of\r\nthe advance made by Robert Fulton and Henry Bell. First, however, he\r\ndevoted his talents as an inventor to a motor in which the power came\r\nfrom explosions of gunpowder. He tried this on a boat which he intended\r\nto run on the Connecticut River between Springfield and Hartford. When\r\nit failed, he turned back to steam, and he undoubtedly would have made\r\na success of this boat line if his money resources had been adequate.\r\n\r\nBeach then invented a rag-cutting machine for use in paper-mills, and\r\nhe might have had a fortune out of it if he had taken a patent in time,\r\nfor the process is still used. As it was, the device enabled him to get\r\nan interest in a paper-mill at Saugerties, New York, where he removed\r\nin 1829. This mill was prosperous for some years, but in 1835 Beach\r\nfound it more profitable to go to work for his young brother-in-law,\r\nMr. Day, who had by this time brought the _Sun_ to the point of assured\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBeach was a great help to Day, not only as the manager of the _Sun’s_\r\nfinances, but as general supervisor of the mechanical department. In\r\nthe three years of his association with Day he picked up a good working\r\nknowledge of the newspaper business. He recognized the features that\r\nhad made the _Sun_ successful--chiefly the presentation of news that\r\ninterested the ordinary reader--and saw the neglect of this policy was\r\nkeeping the old-fashioned sixpenny papers at a standstill.\r\n\r\nHe did not underestimate other news. “Other news,” in that day, meant\r\nthe proceedings of Congress and the New York State Legislature, the\r\ncondensed news of Europe, as received from a London correspondent or\r\nrewritten from the English journals, and such important items as might\r\nbe clipped from the newspapers of the South and West. Many of these\r\nAmerican papers sent proof-sheets of news articles to the _Sun_ by mail.\r\n\r\nWhen Beach bought the paper there was no express service. There had\r\nbeen, in fact, no express service in America except the one which\r\nCharles Davenport and N. S. Mason operated over the Boston and Taunton\r\nRailway. But in March, 1839, about a year after Beach got the _Sun_,\r\nWilliam F. Harnden began an express service--later the Adams Express\r\nCompany--between New York and Boston, using the boats from New York to\r\nProvidence and the rail from Providence to Boston.\r\n\r\nThis was a big help to the New York papers, for with the aid of the\r\nexpress the English papers brought by ships landing at Boston were in\r\nthe New York offices the next day. To a city which still lacked wire\r\ncommunication of any kind this was highly important, and there was\r\nhardly an issue of the _Sun_ in the spring of 1839 that did not contain\r\na paragraph laudatory of Mr. Harnden’s enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe steamship, still a novelty, was the big thing in newspaperdom.\r\nWhile the _Sun_ did not neglect the police-court reports and the animal\r\nstories so dear to its readers, the latest news from abroad usually\r\nhad the place of honour on the second page. The first page remained\r\nthe home of the advertisement and the haunt of the miscellaneous\r\narticle. It was by ship that _Sun_ readers learned of Daguerre and his\r\npicture-taking device; of Cobden and the Anti-Corn-Law League; of the\r\nwar between Abd-el-Kader and the French; of Don Carlos and his ups and\r\ndowns--mostly downs; of the first British invasion of Afghanistan.\r\nThere was the young queen, Victoria, always interesting, and there were\r\nthe doings of actors known to America:\r\n\r\n    At the queen’s desire, her tutor, Dr. Davys--father to the Miss\r\n    Davys whose ears the queen boxed--has been appointed Bishop of\r\n    Marlborough.\r\n\r\n    Charles Kean’s friends say he has been offered the sum of sixty\r\n    pounds a night for sixty nights in New York.\r\n\r\nOn June 1, 1839, the _Sun_ got out an extra on the arrival, at three\r\no’clock that morning, of the Great Western, after a passage of thirteen\r\ndays--the fastest trip up to that time--and fifty-seven thousand\r\ncopies of the paper were sold. The _Sun’s_ own sailing vessels met the\r\nincoming steamships down the bay. The _Sun_ boasted:\r\n\r\n    In consequence of our news-boat arrangements we receive our\r\n    papers more than an hour earlier than any other paper in this\r\n    city. On the arrival of the Liverpool [July 1, 1839], we\r\n    proceeded to issue an extra, which will reach Albany with the\r\n    news twelve hours before it will be published in the regular\r\n    editions of their evening papers, and twenty-four hours ahead\r\n    of the morning papers.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had woodcuts made of all the leading ships, and these, with\r\ntheir curly waves, lit up a page wonderfully, if not beautifully. When\r\nthe British Queen arrived on July 28, 1839, there was a half-page\r\npicture of her. She was the finest ship that had ever been built in\r\nGreat Britain, with her total length of two hundred and seventy-five\r\nfeet--less than one-third as much as some of the modern giants--and her\r\npaddle-wheels with a diameter of thirty-one feet. Small wonder that the\r\n_Sun_ favoured New York with a Sunday paper in honour of the event, and\r\nthat the Monday sale, with the same feature, was forty-nine thousand.\r\nQuoth the _Sun_:\r\n\r\n    Who will wonder, after this, that the lazy, lumbering\r\n    _lazaroni_ of Wall Street stick up their noses at us?\r\n\r\nIn January, 1840, when the packet-ships United States and England\r\narrived together, the _Sun_ gave the story a front-page display, and\r\nactually used full-faced type for the subheads of the article.\r\n\r\nA tragedy is recalled in one paragraph of the _Sun’s_ account of the\r\narrival of the Great Western on April 26, 1841:\r\n\r\n    Up to the closing of the mail from Liverpool to London on the\r\n    7th, the steamer President had not arrived.\r\n\r\nThe President never arrived, and her fate is one of the secrets of\r\nthe sea. She sailed from New York on March 11, 1841, with thirty-one\r\npassengers, including Tyrone Power, the Irish actor, who had just\r\nconcluded his second American tour. It is conjectured that the\r\nPresident sank during the great gale that sprang up her second night\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn getting news from various parts of the United States, the _Sun_ took\r\na leaf from the book of Colonel Webb and other journalists who had\r\nused the horse express. In January, 1841, on the occasion of Governor\r\nWilliam H. Seward’s message to the Legislature, the _Sun_ beat the\r\ntown. The Legislature received the message at 11 A.M. on January 5:\r\n\r\n    An express arriving exclusively for the _Sun_ then started, it\r\n    being one o’clock, and at six this morning reached our office,\r\n    thus enabling us to repeat the triumph achieved by us last year\r\n    over the whole combined press of New York, large and small.\r\n    It is but just to say that our express was brought on by the\r\n    horses of the Red Bird Line with unparalleled expedition, in\r\n    spite of wind, hail, and rain.\r\n\r\nNowadays a Governor’s message is in the newspaper-offices days before\r\nit is sent to the Legislature, and there, treated in the confidence\r\nthat is never betrayed by a decent newspaper, it is prepared for\r\nprinting, so that it may be on the street five minutes after it is\r\ndelivered, if its importance warrants. In the old days the message,\r\nborne by relays of horse vehicles down the snow-covered post-road from\r\nAlbany to New York, was more important to the newspapers than the\r\nmessages of this period appear to be. With newspapers, as with humans,\r\nthat which is easy to get loses value.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1841, the _Sun_ spent money freely to secure a quick report\r\nof the momentous trial of Alexander McLeod for the murder of Amos\r\nDurfee. War between the United States and Great Britain hinged on the\r\noutcome. During the rebellion in Upper Canada, in 1837, the American\r\nsteamer Caroline was used by the insurgents to carry supplies down the\r\nNiagara River to a party of rebels on Navy Island. A party of loyal\r\nCanadians seized and destroyed the Caroline at Grand Island, and in the\r\nfight Durfee and eleven others were killed. The Canadian, McLeod, who\r\nboasted of being a participant, was arrested when he ventured across\r\nthe American border in 1840.\r\n\r\nThe British government made a demand for his release, insisting that\r\nwhat McLeod had done was an act of war, performed under the orders of\r\nhis commanding officer, Captain Drew. President Van Buren replied that\r\nthe American government had several times asked the British government\r\nwhether the destruction of the Caroline was an act of war, and had\r\nnever received a reply; and further, that the Federal government had\r\nno power to prevent the State of New York from trying persons indicted\r\nwithin its jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nThe whole country realized the hostile attitude of the British\r\nministry, and accepted its threat that war would be declared if McLeod\r\nwere not released. The trial took place at Utica, New York, and the\r\n_Sun_ printed from two to five columns a day about it. It ran a special\r\ntrain from Utica to Schenectady. There a famous driver, Otis Dimmick,\r\nwaited with a fine team of horses to take the story to the Albany boat,\r\nthe fastest means of transportation between the State capital and the\r\nmetropolis. The _Sun_ declared that one day Dimmick and his horses made\r\nthe sixteen miles between Schenectady and Albany in forty-nine minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd the end of it all was proof that McLeod, who had boasted of\r\nkilling “a damned Yankee,” had been asleep in Chippewa on the night\r\nof the Caroline affair, and was nothing worse than a braggart. So the\r\nwar-cloud blew over.\r\n\r\nBeach was a man of great faith in railroads and all other forms of\r\nprogress. When the Boston and Albany road was finished, the _Sun_\r\nrelated how a barrel of flour was growing in the field in Canandaigua\r\non a Monday--the barrel in a tree and the flour in the wheat--and on\r\nWednesday, transformed and ready for the baker, it was in Boston.\r\n\r\n    Sperm candles manufactured by Mr. Penniman at Albany on\r\n    Wednesday morning were burning at Faneuil Hall and at the\r\n    Tremont, in Boston, on the evening of the same day.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had faith in Morse and his telegraph from the outset. The\r\ninvention was born in Nassau Street, only a block or two from the\r\n_Sun’s_ office. Morse put the wire into practical use between Baltimore\r\nand Washington on May 24, 1844. That was a Friday. The _Sun_ said\r\nnothing about it the next day, and had no Sunday paper; but on Monday\r\nit said editorially:\r\n\r\n    MAGNETIC TELEGRAPH--The new invention is completed from\r\n    Baltimore to Washington. The wire, perfectly secured against\r\n    the weather by a covering of rope-yarn and tar, is conducted\r\n    on the top of posts about twenty feet high and one hundred\r\n    yards apart. The nominations of the convention this day are to\r\n    be conveyed to Washington by this telegraph, where they will\r\n    arrive in a few seconds. On Saturday morning the batteries were\r\n    charged and the regular transmission of intelligence between\r\n    Washington and Baltimore commenced.... At half past 11 A.M.,\r\n    the question being asked, what was the news at Washington, the\r\n    answer was almost instantaneously returned: “Van Buren stock is\r\n    rising.” This is indeed the annihilation of space.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the convention referred to was the\r\nDemocratic national convention at Baltimore, that Van Buren’s stock,\r\nhigh early in the proceedings, fell again, and that James K. Polk was\r\nthe nominee.\r\n\r\nBut as New York was not fortunate enough to have the first commercial\r\ntelegraph-line, the _Sun_ had to rely on its own efforts for speedy\r\nnews from the convention. It ran special trains from Baltimore,\r\n“beating the United States mail train and locomotive an hour or two.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ soon afterward expressed annoyance at a report that it was\r\nitself a part of a monopoly which was to control the telegraph, and\r\nthat it had bought a telegraph-line from New York to Springfield,\r\nMassachusetts. It insisted that there should be no monopoly, and that\r\nthe use of the telegraph must be open to all. There was no suggestion\r\nthat Morse intended to control his invention improperly, but the _Sun_\r\nwas not quite satisfied with the government’s lassitude. Morse had\r\noffered his rights to the government for one hundred thousand dollars,\r\nand Congress had sneered.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1846 that the telegraph was extended to New York,\r\nand in the meantime the New York papers used such other means as they\r\ncould for the collection of news. Besides trains, ships, horses, and\r\nthe fleet foot of the reporter, there were pigeons. Beach went in for\r\npigeons extensively. When the _Sun_ moved from 156 Nassau Street, in\r\nthe summer of 1842, it took a six-story building at the southwest\r\ncorner of Nassau and Fulton Streets, securing about three times as much\r\nroom as it had in the two-story building at Spruce Street. On the top\r\nof the new building Beach built a pigeon-house, which stood for half a\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe strange, boxlike cote attracted not only the attention of Mr.\r\nBennett, whose _Herald_ was quartered just across the street, but\r\nof all the folk who came and went in that busy region. So many were\r\nthe queries from friends and the quips from enemies concerning the\r\npigeon-house that the _Sun_ (December 14, 1843), vouchsafed to explain:\r\n\r\n    Why, we have had a school of carrier-pigeons in the upper\r\n    apartments of the _Sun_ office since we have occupied the\r\n    building. Did our contemporaries believe that we ever could be\r\n    at fault in furnishing the earliest news to our readers? Or did\r\n    they indulge the hope that in newspaper enterprise they could\r\n    ever catch us napping?\r\n\r\n    Carrier-pigeons have long been remarked for their sagacity\r\n    and admired for their usefulness. They are, of all birds,\r\n    the most invaluable, and as auxiliary to a newspaper cannot\r\n    be too highly prized. Part of the flock in our possession\r\n    were employed by the London _Morning Chronicle_ in bringing\r\n    intelligence from Dublin to London, and from Paris to London,\r\n    crossing both channels; therefore they are not novices in the\r\n    newspaper express.\r\n\r\n    If there was delay in the arrival of the Boston steamer, and\r\n    the weather clear, we despatched our choice pigeon, Sam Patch,\r\n    down the Sound, and he invariably came back with a slip of\r\n    delicate tissue-paper tied under his wing, containing the news.\r\n    We thus are apprised of the arrival of the steamer some two\r\n    hours before any one else hears of her. Our men are at their\r\n    cases; the steam is up in our pressroom, and our extras are\r\n    always out first.\r\n\r\n    We sometimes let one of our carriers fly to the Narrows, and in\r\n    twenty minutes or so we know what is coming in, thirty miles\r\n    from Sandy Hook Light. We despatch them as far as Albany, on\r\n    any important mission; frequently to New Jersey, and in the\r\n    summer-time they sometimes look in at Rockaway and let us know\r\n    what is going on at the pavilion. We have a small sliding door\r\n    in our observatory, on the top of the _Sun_ office, through\r\n    which the little aerials pass. By sending off one every little\r\n    while, we ascertain the details of whatever is important or\r\n    interesting at any given point.\r\n\r\n    They often fly at the rate of sixty miles an hour, easy! For\r\n    example, a half-dozen will leave Washington at daylight this\r\n    morning and arrive here about noon, beating the mail generally\r\n    ten hours or so. They can come through from Albany in about\r\n    two hours and a half, solar time. They fly exceedingly high,\r\n    and keep so until they make the spires of the city, and then\r\n    descend. We have not lost one by any accident, and believe ours\r\n    is the only flock of value or importance in the country.\r\n\r\n    We give this brief detail of “them pigeons” because our prying\r\n    friends and neighbors in the newspaper way have such a meager,\r\n    guesswork account of them; and because we dislike any mystery\r\n    or artifice in our business operations.\r\n\r\nSpeed and more speed was the newspaper demand of the hour, particularly\r\namong the penny papers. The _Sun_ and the _Herald_ had been battling\r\nfor years, with competitors springing up about them, usually to die\r\nwithin the twelvemonth. Now the _Tribune_ had come to remain in the\r\nfray, even if it had not as much money to spend on news-gathering as\r\nthe _Sun_ and the _Herald_.\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe saw the fever that raged among the rivals. He had just\r\nreturned to New York from Philadelphia with his sick wife and his\r\nmother. He was a recognized genius, but his worldly wealth amounted\r\nto four dollars and fifty cents. He had written “The Narrative of A.\r\nGordon Pym,” “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” “The Gold Bug,” and other\r\nimmortal stories, but his livelihood had been precarious. He had\r\nbeen in turn connected with the _Southern Literary Messenger_, the\r\n_Gentleman’s Magazine_, and _Graham’s Magazine_, and had twice issued\r\nthe prospectuses for new periodicals of his own, fated never to be born.\r\n\r\nHis fortunes were at their lowest when he arrived in New York on April\r\n6, 1844. He and his family found rooms in Greenwich Street, near Cedar,\r\nnow the thick of the business district. “The house is old and looks\r\nbuggy,” he wrote to a friend, but it was the best he could do with less\r\nthan five dollars in his pocket.\r\n\r\nHe had to have more money. The newspapers seemed to be the most\r\navailable place to get it, and the _Sun_ the livest of them.\r\nSpeed--that was what they wanted. They had been having ocean steamers\r\nuntil they were almost sick. Railroads were unromantic. Horses were an\r\nold story. The telegraph was still regarded as theory, and it hardly\r\nappealed to the imagination.\r\n\r\nPigeons? Perhaps there was inspiration in the sight of Sam Patch\r\npreening himself on a cornice of the _Sun’s_ building. A magnified\r\npigeon would be an air-ship. Poe sat him down, wrote the “balloon\r\nhoax,” and sold it to Mr. Beach. It appeared in the _Sun_ of April 13,\r\n1844.\r\n\r\nBeneath a black-faced heading that was supplemented by a woodcut of\r\nthree race-horses flying under the whips of their jockeys and the\r\nsubtitle “By Express,” was the following introduction:\r\n\r\n    ASTOUNDING INTELLIGENCE BY PRIVATE EXPRESS FROM CHARLESTON,\r\n      VIA NORFOLK!--THE ATLANTIC OCEAN CROSSED IN THREE\r\n      DAYS!!!--ARRIVAL AT SULLIVAN’S ISLAND OF A STEERING BALLOON\r\n      INVENTED BY MR. MONCK MASON.\r\n\r\nWe stop the press at a late hour to announce that by a private express\r\nfrom Charleston, South Carolina, we are just put in possession of\r\nfull details of the most extraordinary adventure ever accomplished by\r\nman. _The Atlantic Ocean has actually been traversed in a balloon,\r\nand in the incredibly brief period of three days!_ Eight persons have\r\ncrossed in the machine, among others Sir Everard Bringhurst and Mr.\r\nMonck Mason. We have barely time now to announce this most novel and\r\nunexpected intelligence, but we hope by ten this morning to have ready\r\nan extra with a detailed account of the voyage.\r\n\r\nP. S.--The extra will be positively ready, and for sale at our counter,\r\nby ten o’clock this morning. It will embrace all the particulars yet\r\nknown. We have also placed in the hands of an excellent artist a\r\nrepresentation of the “Steering Balloon,” which will accompany the\r\nparticulars of the voyage.\r\n\r\nThe promised extra bore a head of stud-horse type, six banks in all,\r\nand as many inches deep.\r\n\r\n“Astounding News by Express, _via_ Norfolk!” it announced. “The\r\nAtlantic Crossed in Three Days!--Signal Triumph of Mr. Monck Mason’s\r\nFlying-Machine!!!--Arrival at Sullivan’s Island, Near Charleston, of\r\nMr. Mason, Mr. Robert Holland, Mr. Henson, Mr. Harrison Ainsworth,\r\nand Four Others in the Steering Balloon Victoria, after a Passage of\r\nSeventy-Five Hours from Land to Land--Full Particulars of the Voyage!!!”\r\n\r\n    The great problem is at length solved. The air, as well as\r\n    the earth and the ocean, has been subdued by science, and\r\n    will become a common and convenient highway for mankind. The\r\n    Atlantic has been actually crossed in a balloon! And this, too,\r\n    without difficulty--without any great apparent danger--with\r\n    thorough control of the machine--and in the inconceivably brief\r\n    period of seventy-five hours from shore to shore!\r\n\r\n    By the energy of an agent at Charleston, South Carolina, we\r\n    are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a\r\n    detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage, which\r\n    was performed between Saturday, the 6th instant, at 11 A.M.\r\n    and 2 P.M. on Tuesday, the 9th instant, by Sir Everard\r\n    Bringhurst, Mr. Osborne, a nephew of Lord Bentinck; Mr. Monck\r\n    Mason, and Mr. Robert Holland, the well-known aeronauts; Mr.\r\n    Harrison Ainsworth, author of “Jack Sheppard,” _et cetera_,\r\n    and Mr. Henson, the projector of the late unsuccessful\r\n    flying-machine--with two seamen from Woolwich--in all, eight\r\n    persons.\r\n\r\n    The particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic\r\n    and accurate in every respect, as with a slight exception they\r\n    are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of Mr. Monck Mason\r\n    and Mr. Harrison Ainsworth, to whose politeness our agent is\r\n    indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon\r\n    itself, its construction, and other matters of interest. The\r\n    only alteration in the MS. received has been made for the\r\n    purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent, Mr.\r\n    Forsyth, into a connected and intelligible form.\r\n\r\nThe story that followed was about five thousand words in length. To\r\nsummarize it, Monck Mason had applied the principle of the Archimedean\r\nscrew to the propulsion of a dirigible balloon. The gas-bag was an\r\nellipsoid thirteen feet long, with a car suspended from it. The screw\r\npropeller, which was attached to the car, was operated by a spring. A\r\nrudder shaped like a battledore kept the air-ship on its course.\r\n\r\nThe voyagers, according to the story, started from Mr. Osborne’s\r\nhome near Penstruthal, in North Wales, intending to sail across the\r\nEnglish Channel. The mechanism of the propeller broke, and the balloon,\r\ncaught in a strong northeast wind, was carried across the Atlantic at\r\nthe speed of sixty or more miles an hour. Mr. Mason kept a journal,\r\nto which, at the end of each day, Mr. Ainsworth added a postscript.\r\nThe balloon landed safely on the coast of South Carolina, near Fort\r\nMoultrie.\r\n\r\nThe names of the supposed voyagers were well chosen by Poe to give\r\nverisimilitude to the hoax. Monck Mason and Robert Holland, or Hollond,\r\nwere of the small party which actually sailed from Vauxhall Gardens,\r\nLondon, on the afternoon of November 7, 1836, in the balloon Nassau and\r\nlanded at Weilburg, in Germany, five hundred miles away, eighteen hours\r\nlater. Harrison Ainsworth, the novelist, was then one of the shining\r\nstars of English literary life. The others named by Poe were familiar\r\nfigures of the period.\r\n\r\nPoe adopted the plan, used so successfully by Locke in the moon hoax,\r\nof having real people do the thing that they would like to do; but\r\nthere the resemblance of the two hoaxes ends, except for the technical\r\nbits that Poe was able to inject into his narrative. The moon hoax\r\nlasted for weeks; the balloon hoax for a day. Even the _Sun_ did not\r\nattempt to bolster it, for it said the second day afterward:\r\n\r\n    BALLOON--The mails from the South last Saturday night not\r\n    having brought confirmation of the balloon from England, the\r\n    particulars of which from our correspondent we detailed in our\r\n    extra, we are inclined to believe that the intelligence is\r\n    erroneous. The description of the balloon and the voyage was\r\n    written with a minuteness and scientific ability calculated to\r\n    obtain credit everywhere, and was read with great pleasure and\r\n    satisfaction. We by no means think such a project impossible.\r\n\r\nAbout a week later, when the _Sun_ was still being pounded by its\r\ncontemporaries, a few of which had been gulled into rewriting the\r\nstory, another editorial article on the hoax appeared:\r\n\r\n    BALLOON EXPRESS--We have been somewhat amused with the comments\r\n    of the press upon the balloon express. The more intelligent\r\n    editors saw its object at once. On the other hand, many of\r\n    our esteemed contemporaries--those who are too ignorant to\r\n    appreciate the pleasant satire--have ascribed to us the worst\r\n    and basest motives. We expected as much.\r\n\r\nThe “pleasant satire” of which the _Sun_ spoke was evidently meant to\r\nhold up to view the craze of the day for speed in the transmission of\r\nnews and men. Yet the _Sun_ itself, as the leader of penny journalism,\r\nhad been to a great extent the cause of this craze. It had taught the\r\npeople to read the news and to hanker for more.\r\n\r\nThere was another story which Poe and the _Sun_ shared--one that will\r\noutlive even the balloon hoax. Almost buried on the third page of the\r\n_Sun_ of July 28, 1841, was this advertisement in agate type:\r\n\r\n    Left her home on Sunday morning, July 25, a young lady; had\r\n    on a white dress, black shawl, blue scarf, Leghorn hat,\r\n    light-colored shoes, and parasol light-colored; it is supposed\r\n    some accident has befallen her. Whoever will give information\r\n    respecting her at 126 Nassau shall be rewarded for their\r\n    trouble.\r\n\r\nThe next day the _Sun_ said in its news columns:\r\n\r\n    ☞ The body of a young lady some eighteen or twenty years of age\r\n    was found in the water at Hoboken. From the description of her\r\n    dress, fears are entertained that it is the body of Miss Mary\r\n    C. Rogers, who is advertised in yesterday’s paper as having\r\n    disappeared from her home, 126 Nassau Street, on Sunday last.\r\n\r\nThe fears were well grounded, for the dead girl was Mary Cecilia\r\nRogers, the “beautiful cigar-girl” who had been the magnet at John\r\nAnderson’s tobacco-shop at Broadway and Duane Street; the tragic figure\r\nof Poe’s story, “The Mystery of Marie Roget,” a tale which served to\r\nkeep alive the features of that unsolved riddle of the Elysian Fields\r\nof Hoboken. To the _Sun_, which had then no Poe, no _Sherlock Holmes_,\r\nthe murder was the text for a moral lesson:\r\n\r\n    There can be no question that she had fallen a victim to the\r\n    most imprudent and reprehensible practise, which has recently\r\n    obtained to a considerable extent in this city, of placing\r\n    behind the counters and at the windows of stores for the sale\r\n    of articles purchased exclusively by males--especially of\r\n    cigar-stores and drinking-houses--young and beautiful females\r\n    for the purpose of thus attracting the attention, exciting the\r\n    interest (or worse still), and thus inducing the visits and\r\n    consequent custom, of the other sex--especially of the young\r\n    and thoughtless.\r\n\r\n    It was by being placed in such a situation, in one of the\r\n    most public spots in the city, that this unfortunate girl\r\n    was led into a train of acquaintances and associations which\r\n    has eventually proved not only her ruin, but an untimely and\r\n    violent death in the prime of youth and beauty. From being\r\n    used as an instrument of cupidity--as a sort of “man-trap”\r\n    to lure by her charms the gay and giddy into the path of the\r\n    spendthrift and of constant dissipation--she has become the\r\n    victim of the very passions and vices which her exposure to\r\n    the public gaze for mercenary gain was so well calculated to\r\n    engender and encourage.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ and the other papers might have pursued the Mary Rogers\r\nmystery further than they did had it not been that in a few weeks a\r\nmore tangible tragedy presented itself, when John C. Colt, a teacher\r\nof bookkeeping, and the brother of Samuel Colt, the inventor, killed\r\nSamuel Adams, one of the leading printers of New York. Adams had gone\r\nto Colt’s lodgings at Broadway and Chambers Street to collect a bill,\r\nand Colt, who had a furious temper, murdered him with a hammer, packed\r\nthe body in a box, and hired an innocent drayman to haul it down to\r\nthe ship Kalamazoo, for shipment to New Orleans. This affair drove\r\nthe Rogers murder out of the types, and left it for Poe to preserve in\r\nfiction with the names of the characters thinly veiled and the scene\r\ntransferred to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe great social event of the town in 1842 was the visit of Charles\r\nDickens. He had been expected for several years. In fact, as far back\r\nas October 13, 1838, the _Sun_ remarked:\r\n\r\n    Boz is coming to America. We hope he will not make a fool of\r\n    himself here, like a majority of his distinguished countrymen\r\n    who preceded him.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ got out an extra on the day when Dickens landed, but it\r\nwas not in honour of Boz, but rather because of the arrival of\r\nthe Britannia with a budget of foreign news. Buried in a mass of\r\nContinental paragraphs was this one:\r\n\r\n    Among the passengers are Mr. Charles Dickens, the celebrated\r\n    author, and his lady.\r\n\r\nThe ship-news man never even thought to ask Dickens how he liked\r\nAmerica. But society was waiting for Boz, and he was tossed about on a\r\nlively sea of receptions and dinners. The _Sun_ presently thought that\r\nthe young author was being exploited overmuch:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dickens, we have no doubt, is a very respectable gentleman,\r\n    and we know that he is a very clever and agreeable author. He\r\n    has written several books that have put the reading world in\r\n    most excellent good humor. In this way he has done much to\r\n    promote the general happiness of mankind, and honestly deserves\r\n    their gratitude.\r\n\r\n    Having crossed the water for the purpose of traveling in\r\n    America, where his works have been extensively read and\r\n    admired, he is, of course, received and treated with marked\r\n    civility, attention, and respect. We should be ashamed of our\r\n    countrymen if it were otherwise. During his stay at Boston the\r\n    citizens gave him a public dinner. At New Haven he received\r\n    a similar token of kind regard. In this city a ball has been\r\n    given him. All these attentions were right and proper, and\r\n    as far as we can learn they have been uniformly conducted in\r\n    a gentlemanly and respectable manner, becoming alike to the\r\n    characters of those who gave and him who received them.\r\n\r\n    But a few penny-catchers of the press are determined to make\r\n    money out of Boz. The shop-windows are stuffed with lithograph\r\n    likenesses of him, which resemble the original just about as\r\n    much as he resembles a horse. His own wife would not recognize\r\n    them in any other way than by the word “Boz” written under them.\r\n\r\n    Then a corps of sneaking reporters, most of them fresh from\r\n    London, are pursuing him like a pack of hounds at his heels to\r\n    catch every wink of his eye, every motion of his hands, and\r\n    every word that he speaks, to be dished up with all conceivable\r\n    embellishments by pen and pencil, and published in extras,\r\n    pamphlets, and handbills. To make all this trash sell well in\r\n    the market, the greatest possible hurrah must be made by the\r\n    papers interested in the speculations, and therefore the whole\r\n    American people are basely caricatured by them, and represented\r\n    as one vast mob following Dickens from place to place, and\r\n    striving even to touch the hem of his garment.\r\n\r\n    That our readers at a distance may not be induced to suppose\r\n    that the good people of New York are befooling themselves in\r\n    this way, we beg leave to assure them that all these absurd\r\n    reports are ridiculous caricatures, hatched from the prolific\r\n    brains of a few reckless reporters for a few unprincipled\r\n    papers. They do in truth make as great fools of themselves as\r\n    they represent the public to be generally. But beyond their\r\n    narrow and contemptible circle we are happy to know that Mr.\r\n    Dickens is treated with that manly and sincere respect which\r\n    is so justly his due, and which must convince him that he is\r\n    amongst a warm-hearted people, who know both how to respect\r\n    their guest and themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen Dickens sailed for home, in June, the _Sun_ bade him _bon voyage_\r\nwith but a paragraph. It was more than a year afterward that it came to\r\nhim again; and meanwhile he had trodden on the toes of America:\r\n\r\n    The appearance of the current number of “The Life and\r\n    Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit” will not add to the happiness\r\n    of retrospections. Where is that Boston committee, where the\r\n    renowned getters-up of the City Hotel dinner and the ball at\r\n    the Park Theater, with its _tableaux vivants_, its splendid\r\n    decorations, and tickets at ten dollars each?\r\n\r\n    The scene is passing now before our memory--the crammed\r\n    theater, full up to its third tier, the dense crowd opening\r\n    a passage for Mr. Dickens and the proud and happy committee\r\n    while he passes up the center of the stage amid huzzas and the\r\n    waving of handkerchiefs, while the band is playing “God Save\r\n    the Queen” and “See, the Conquering Hero Comes.” And _our_\r\n    Irving, _our_ Halleck, _our_ Bryant passed around in the crowd,\r\n    unnoticed and almost unknown. Shame! Let our cheeks crimson, as\r\n    they ought.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ itself was doing very nicely. On its tenth birthday,\r\nSeptember 3, 1843, it announced that it employed eight editors and\r\nreporters, twenty compositors, sixteen pressmen, twelve folders and\r\ncounters, and one hundred carriers. The circulation of the daily paper\r\nwas thirty-eight thousand, of the _Weekly Sun_ twelve thousand.\r\n\r\nMr. Beach owned the _Sun’s_ new home at Fulton and Nassau Streets and\r\nthe building at 156 Nassau Street which he had recently vacated, and\r\nwhich was burned down in the fire of February 6, 1845. He had a London\r\ncorrespondent who ran a special horse express to carry the news from\r\nLondon to Bristol. A _Sun_ reporter went to report Webster’s speech on\r\nthe great day when the Bunker Hill Monument was finished. He got down\r\ncorrectly at least the last sentence: “Thank God, I--I also--am an\r\nAmerican!”\r\n\r\nWith a circulation by far the largest in the world, the _Sun_ was\r\nobliged to buy a new dress of type every three months, for the day of\r\nthe curved stereotype plate was still far off. Early in 1846 two new\r\npresses, each capable of six thousand _Suns_ an hour, were put in at a\r\ncost of twelve thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe size of the paper grew constantly, although Beach stuck to a\r\nfour-page sheet because of the limitations of the presses. Instead of\r\nadding pages, he added columns. From Day’s little three-column _Sun_\r\nthe paper had grown, by April of 1840, to a width of seven columns. Of\r\nthe total of twenty-eight columns in an issue twenty-one and a half\r\nwere devoted to advertising, three to mixed news and editorials, two\r\nand a half to the court reports, and one column to reprint.\r\n\r\nWith the page seven columns wide, Beach thought that the two\r\nwords--“_The Sun_”--looked lonely, and to fill out the heading he\r\nchanged it to read “_The New York Sun_.” This continued from April 13\r\nto September 29, 1840, when the proprietor saw how much more economical\r\nit would be to cut out “New York” and push the first and seventh\r\ncolumns of the first page up to the top of the paper. Then it was “_The\r\nSun_” once more in head-line as well as body.\r\n\r\nThe paper is never the _New York Sun_, Eugene Field’s poem to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding. It is the _Sun_, universal in its spirit, and\r\npublished in New York by the accident of birth.\r\n\r\nThree years after that the _Sun_ became an eight-column paper, and\r\nthere were no more sneers at the blanket sheets, for the _Sun_ itself\r\nwas getting pretty wide.\r\n\r\nIt was in the reign of Moses Y. Beach as owner of the _Sun_, that\r\nHorace Greeley came to stay in New York journalism. He had been fairly\r\nsuccessful as editor of the _New Yorker_, and his management of the\r\ncampaign paper called the _Log Cabin_, issued in 1840 in the interest\r\nof General Harrison, was masterly. With the prestige thus obtained, he\r\nwas able, on April 10, 1841, to start the _Tribune_.\r\n\r\nIn the first number he announced his intention of excluding the\r\npolice reports which had been so valuable to “our leading penny\r\npapers”--meaning the _Sun_ and the _Herald_--and of making the\r\n_Tribune_ “worthy of the hearty approval of the virtuous and refined.”\r\nIt was a week before the _Sun_ mentioned its former friend, and then it\r\nwas only to say:\r\n\r\n    A word to Horace Greeley--if he wishes us to write him or any\r\n    of his sickly brood of newspapers into notice, he must first go\r\n    to school and learn a little decency. He must further retract\r\n    the dirty, malignant, and wholesale falsehood which he procured\r\n    to be published in the Albany _Evening Journal_ a year ago last\r\n    winter, with the hope of injuring the _Sun_. He must then deal\r\n    in something besides misstatements of facts.... Until he does\r\n    all this we shall feel very indifferent to any thrusts that he\r\n    can make at us with his dagger of lath.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward the _Sun_ rubbed it in by quoting the Albany _Evening\r\nJournal_:\r\n\r\n    Galvanize a large New England squash, and it would make as\r\n    capable an editor as Horace.\r\n\r\nBut Greeley was a lively young man, in spite of his eccentric ways and\r\nhis habit of letting one leg of his trousers hang out of his unpolished\r\nboots. Only thirty when he started the _Tribune_, he had had a lot\r\nof experience, particularly with politicians and with fads. He still\r\nbelieved in some of the fads, including temperance--which was then\r\nconsidered a fad--vegetarianism, and Abolition. He had been, too, a\r\npoet; and his verses lived to haunt his mature years. He had to give\r\naway most of the five thousand copies that were printed of the first\r\nnumber of the _Tribune_, but in a month he had a circulation of six\r\nthousand, and in two months he doubled this.\r\n\r\nGreeley had the instinct for getting good men, but not always the knack\r\nof holding them. One of his early finds was Henry J. Raymond, who\r\nattracted his attention as a boy orator for the Whig cause. Raymond\r\nworked for Greeley’s _New Yorker_ and later for the _Tribune_. He was a\r\ngood reporter, using a system of shorthand of his own devising.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, at least, he enabled the _Tribune_ to beat the other\r\npapers. He was sent to Boston to report a speech, and he took with\r\nhim three printers and their cases of type. After the speech Raymond\r\nand his compositors boarded the boat for New York, and as fast as the\r\nreporter transcribed his notes the printers put the speech into type.\r\nOn the arrival of the boat at New York the type was ready to be put\r\ninto the forms, and the _Tribune_ was on the street hours ahead of its\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\nGreeley paid Raymond eight dollars a week until Raymond threatened to\r\nleave unless he received twenty dollars a week. He got it, but Greeley\r\nmade such a fuss about the matter that Raymond realized that further\r\nincreases would be out of the question. Presently he went to the\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, and from 1843 to 1850 he tried to restore some\r\nof the glory that once had crowned Colonel Webb’s paper.\r\n\r\nIn this period Raymond and his former employer, Greeley, fought their\r\ncelebrated editorial duel--with pens, not mahogany-handled pistols--on\r\nthe subject of Fourierism, that theory of social reorganization which\r\nGreeley seemed anxious to spread, and which was zealously preached\r\nby another of his young men, Albert Brisbane, now perhaps better\r\nremembered as the father of Arthur Brisbane. But Colonel Webb’s paper\r\nwould not wake wide enough to suit the ambitious Raymond, who seized\r\nthe opportunity of becoming the first editor of the New York _Times_.\r\n\r\nOther men who worked for Greeley’s _Tribune_ in its young days were\r\nBayard Taylor, who wrote articles from Europe; George William Curtis,\r\nthe essayist; Count Gurowski, an authority on foreign affairs; and\r\nCharles A. Dana.\r\n\r\nBeach soon recognized Greeley as a considerable rival in the morning\r\nfield, and there was a long tussle between the _Sun_ and the\r\n_Tribune_. It did not content itself with words, and there were street\r\nbattles between the boys who sold the two papers. Stung by one of\r\nBeach’s articles, Greeley called the _Sun_ “the slimy and venomous\r\ninstrument of Locofocoism, Jesuitical and deadly in politics and\r\ngrovelling in morals.” The term Locofoco had then lost its original\r\napplication to the Equal Rights section of the Democratic party and was\r\napplied--particularly by the Whigs--to any sort of Democrat.\r\n\r\nMoses Y. Beach had no such young journalists about him as Dana or\r\nRaymond, but he had two sons who seemed well adapted to take up the\r\nownership of the _Sun_. He took them in as partners on October 22,\r\n1845, under the title of “M. Y. Beach & Sons.” The elder son, Moses\r\nSperry Beach, was then twenty-three years old, and had already been\r\nwell acquainted with the newspaper business, particularly with the\r\nmechanical side of it. Before his father took him as a partner, young\r\nMoses had joined with George Roberts in the publication of the Boston\r\n_Daily Times_, but he was glad to drop this and devote himself to the\r\nvaluable property at Fulton and Nassau Streets.\r\n\r\nIf a genius for invention is inheritable, both the Beach boys were\r\nrichly endowed by their father. Moses S. invented devices for the\r\nfeeding of rolls of paper, instead of sheets, to flat presses; for\r\nwetting news-print paper prior to printing; for cutting the sheets\r\nafter printing; and for adapting newspaper presses to print both sides\r\nof the sheet at the same time.\r\n\r\nAlfred Ely Beach was only nineteen when he became partner in the _Sun_.\r\nAfter leaving the academy at Monson, Massachusetts, where he had been\r\nschooled, he worked with his father in the _Sun_ office, and learned\r\nevery detail of the business. The inventive vein was even deeper in\r\nhim than in his brother. When he was twenty he formed a partnership\r\nwith his old schoolmate, Orson D. Munn, of Monson, and they bought the\r\n_Scientific American_ from Rufus Porter and combined its publishing\r\nbusiness with that of soliciting patents.\r\n\r\nAlfred Beach retained his interest in the _Sun_ for several years, but\r\nhe is best remembered for his inventions and for his connection with\r\nscientific literature. In 1853 he devised the first typewriter which\r\nprinted raised letters on a strip of paper for the blind. He invented\r\na pneumatic mail-tube, and a larger tube on the same principle, by\r\nwhich he hoped passengers could be carried, the motive power being the\r\nexhaustion of air at the far end by means of a rotating fan.\r\n\r\nHe was the first subway-constructor in New York. In 1869 he built a\r\ntunnel nine feet in diameter under Broadway from Warren Street to\r\nMurray Street, and the next year a car was sent to and fro in this\r\nby pneumatic power. A more helpful invention, however, was the Beach\r\nshield for tunnel-digging--a gigantic hogs-head with the ends removed,\r\nthe front circular edge being sharp and the rear end having a thin iron\r\nhood. This cylinder was propelled slowly through the earth by hydraulic\r\nrams, the dislodged material being removed through the rear.\r\n\r\nMr. Beach was connected with the _Scientific American_ until his death\r\nin 1896. His son, Frederick Converse Beach, was one of the editors of\r\nthat periodical, and his grandson, Stanley Yale Beach, is still in the\r\nsame field of endeavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n“THE SUN” IN THE MEXICAN WAR\r\n\r\n  _Moses Y. Beach as an Emissary of President Polk.--The Associated\r\n    Press Founded in the Office of “The Sun.”--Ben Day’s\r\n    Brother-in-Law Retires with a Small Fortune._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Beaches, father and sons, owned the _Sun_ throughout the Mexican\r\nWar, a period notable for the advance of newspaper enterprise; and\r\nMoses Yale Beach proved more than once that he was the peer of Bennett\r\nin the matter of getting news.\r\n\r\nShortly before war was declared--April 24, 1846--the telegraph-line was\r\nbuilt from Philadelphia to Fort Lee, New Jersey, opposite New York.\r\nJune found a line opened from New York to Boston; September, a line\r\nfrom New York to Albany. The ports and the capitals of the nation were\r\nno longer dependent on horse expresses, or even upon the railroads, for\r\nbrief news of importance. Morse had subdued space.\r\n\r\nFor a little time after the Mexican War began there was a gap in the\r\ntelegraph between Washington and New York, the line between Baltimore\r\nand Philadelphia not having been completed; but with the aid of special\r\ntrains the _Sun_ was able to present the news a few hours after it left\r\nWashington. It was, of course, not exactly fresh news, for the actual\r\nhostilities in Mexico were not heard of at Washington until May 11,\r\nmore than two weeks after their accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe good news from the battle-fields of Palo Alto and Resaca de la\r\nPalma was eighteen days in reaching New York. All Mexican news came by\r\nsteamer to New Orleans or Mobile, and was forwarded from those ports,\r\nby the railroad or other means, to the nearest telegraph-station. Moses\r\nY. Beach was instrumental in whipping up the service from the South,\r\nfor he established a special railroad news service between Mobile and\r\nMontgomery, a district of Alabama where there had been much delay.\r\n\r\nOn September 11, 1846, the _Sun_ uttered halleluiahs over the spread of\r\nthe telegraph. The line to Buffalo had been opened on the previous day.\r\nThe invention had been in every-day use only two years, but more than\r\ntwelve hundred miles of line had been built, as follows:\r\n\r\n  New York to Boston                                     265\r\n  New York to Albany and Buffalo                         507\r\n  New York to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington    240\r\n  Philadelphia to Harrisburg                             105\r\n  Boston to Lowell                                        26\r\n  Boston toward Portland                                  55\r\n  Ithaca to Auburn                                        40\r\n  Troy to Saratoga                                        31\r\n                                                       -----\r\n         Total                                         1,269\r\n\r\nEngland had then only one hundred and seventy-five miles of telegraph.\r\n“This,” gloated the _Sun_, “is American enterprise!”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ did not have a special correspondent in Mexico, and most of\r\nits big stories during the war, including the account of the storming\r\nof Monterey, were those sent to the New Orleans _Picayune_ by George W.\r\nKendall, who is supposed to have put in the mouth of General Taylor the\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n“A little more grape, Captain Bragg!”\r\n\r\nMoses Yale Beach himself started for Mexico as a special agent of\r\nPresident Polk, with power to talk peace, but the negotiations between\r\nBeach and the Mexican government were broken off by a false report of\r\nGeneral Taylor’s defeat by Santa Anna, and Mr. Beach returned to his\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe more facilities for news-getting the papers enjoyed, the more\r\nthey printed--and the more it cost them. Each had been doing its bit\r\non its own hook. The _Sun_ and the _Courier and Enquirer_ had spent\r\nextravagant sums on their horse expresses from Washington. The _Sun_\r\nand the _Herald_ may have profited by hiring express-trains to race\r\nfrom Boston to New York with the latest news brought by the steamships,\r\nbut the outflow of money was immense. The news-boats--clipper-ships,\r\nsteam-vessels, and rowboats--which went down to Sandy Hook to meet\r\nincoming steamers cost the _Sun_, the _Herald_, the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_, and the _Journal of Commerce_ a pretty penny.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the Mexican War there were special trains to be run\r\nin the South. And now the telegraph, with its expensive tolls, was\r\nmagnetizing money out of every newspaper’s till. Not only that, but\r\nthere was only one wire, and the correspondent who got to it first\r\nusually hogged it, paying tolls to have a chapter from the Bible, or\r\nwhatever was the reporter’s favourite book, put on the wire until his\r\nstory should be ready to start.\r\n\r\nIt was all wrong, and at last, through pain in the pocket, the\r\nnewspapers came to realize it. At a conference held in the office of\r\nthe _Sun_, toward the close of the Mexican War, steps were taken to\r\nlessen the waste of money, men, and time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MOSES SPERRY BEACH\r\n    A Nephew of Benjamin H. Day and a Son of Moses Yale Beach. He\r\n    Held “The Sun” Until Dana’s Time. This Picture is Reproduced\r\n    from the First Edition of Mark Twain’s “Innocents Abroad.” Mr.\r\n    Beach Was One of Clemens’s Fellow Voyagers.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt this meeting, presided over by Gerard Hallock, the veteran editor\r\nof the _Journal of Commerce_, there were represented the _Sun_, the\r\n_Herald_, the _Tribune_--the three most militant morning papers--the\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, the _Express_, and Mr. Hallock’s own paper.\r\nThe conference formed the Harbour Association, by which one fleet\r\nof news-boats would do the work for which half a dozen had been\r\nused, and the New York Associated Press, designed for cooperation in\r\nthe gathering of news in centres like Washington, Albany, Boston,\r\nPhiladelphia, and New Orleans. Alexander Jones, of the _Journal of\r\nCommerce_, became the first agent of the new organization. He had been\r\na reporter on both sides of the Atlantic, and it was he who invented\r\nthe first cipher code for use in the telegraph, saving time and tolls.\r\n\r\nThus in the office where some of the bitterest invective against\r\nnewspaper rivals had been penned, there began an era of good feeling.\r\nSo busy had the world become, and so full of news, through the new\r\nmeans of communication afforded by Professor Morse, that the invention\r\nof opprobrious names for Mr. Bennett ceased to be a great journalistic\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the change in the personal relations of the newspaper\r\neditors and proprietors, the guests present at a dinner given by Moses\r\nY. Beach in December, 1848, when he retired from business and turned\r\nthe _Sun_ over to his sons Moses and Alfred, were the venerable Major\r\nNoah, then retired from newspaper life; Gerard Hallock, Horace Greeley,\r\nHenry J. Raymond, of the _Courier and Enquirer_, and James Brooks, of\r\nthe _Express_. All praised Beach and his fourteen years of labour on\r\nthe _Sun_, but there was never a word about Benjamin H. Day. Evidently\r\nthat gentleman’s re-entry into the newspaper field as the proprietor of\r\nthe _True Sun_ had put him out of tune with his brother-in-law. Richard\r\nAdams Locke was there, however--the only relic of the first régime.\r\n\r\nWhat the _Sun_ thought of itself then is indicated in an editorial\r\nprinted on December 4, when the Beach brothers relieved their father,\r\nwho was in bad health:\r\n\r\n    We ask those under whose eyes the _Sun_ does not shine from\r\n    day to day--our _Sun_, we mean; this large and well-printed\r\n    one-cent newspaper--to look it over and say whether it is not\r\n    one of the wonders of the age. Does it not contain the elements\r\n    of all that is valuable in a diurnal sheet? Where is more\r\n    effort or enterprise expended for so small a return?\r\n\r\n    Of this effort and enterprise we feel proud; and a circulation\r\n    of over fifty thousand copies of our sheet every day among at\r\n    least five times that number of readers, together with the\r\n    largest cash advertising patronage on this continent, convinces\r\n    us that our pride is widely shared.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ that Ben Day had turned over to Moses Y. Beach was no longer\r\nrecognizable. Fifteen years had wrought many changes from the time when\r\nthe young Yankee printer launched his venture on the tide of chance.\r\nThe steamship, the railroad, and the telegraph had made over American\r\njournalism. The police-court items, the little local scandals, the\r\nanimal stories--all the trifles upon which Day had made his way to\r\nprosperity--were now being shoved aside to make room for the quick, hot\r\nnews that came in from many quarters. The _Sun_ still strove for the\r\npatronage of the People, with a capital P, but it had educated them\r\naway from the elementary.\r\n\r\nThe elder Beach was enterprising, but never rash. He made the _Sun_ a\r\nbetter business proposition than ever it was under Day. Ben Day carried\r\na journalistic sword at his belt; Beach, a pen over his ear. Perhaps\r\nDay could not have brought the _Sun_ up to a circulation of fifty\r\nthousand and a money value of a quarter of a million dollars; but, on\r\nthe other hand, it is unlikely that Beach could ever have started the\r\n_Sun_.\r\n\r\nOnce it was started, and once he had seen how it was run, the task of\r\nkeeping it going was fairly easy for him. He was a good publisher. Not\r\ncontent with getting out the _Sun_ proper, he established the _Weekly\r\nSun_, issued on Saturdays, and intended for country circulation, at\r\none dollar a year. In 1848 he got out the _American Sun_, at twelve\r\nshillings a year, which was shipped abroad for the use of Europeans who\r\ncared to read of our rude American doings. Another venture of Beach’s\r\nwas the _Illustrated Sun and Monthly Literary Journal_, a sixteen-page\r\nmagazine full of woodcuts.\r\n\r\nMr. Beach had for sale at the _Sun_ office all the latest novels in\r\ncheap editions. He wrote a little book himself--“The Wealth of New\r\nYork: A Table of the Wealth of the Wealthy Citizens of New York City\r\nWho Are Estimated to Be Worth One Hundred Thousand Dollars or Over,\r\nwith Brief Biographical Notices.” It sold for twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Beach was the father of the newspaper syndicate. In December,\r\n1841, when the _Sun_ received President Tyler’s message to Congress\r\nby special messenger, he had extra editions of one sheet printed for\r\ntwenty other newspapers, using the same type for the body of the\r\nissue, and changing only the title-head. In this way such papers as\r\nthe _Vermont Chronicle_, the Albany _Advertiser_, the Troy _Whig_, the\r\nSalem _Gazette_, and the Boston _Times_ were able to give the whole\r\ntext of the message to their readers without the delay and expense of\r\nsetting it in type.\r\n\r\nHere is Dana’s own estimate of the second proprietor of the _Sun_:\r\n\r\n    Moses Y. Beach was a business man and a newspaper manager\r\n    rather than what we now understand as a journalist--that is\r\n    to say, one who is both a writer and a practical conductor\r\n    and director of a newspaper. Mr. Beach was a man noted for\r\n    enterprise in the collection of news. In the latter days when\r\n    he owned and managed the _Sun_ in New York, the telegraph was\r\n    only established between Washington and Boston, though toward\r\n    the end of his career it was extended, if I am not mistaken, as\r\n    far towards the South as Montgomery in Alabama. The news from\r\n    Europe was then brought to Halifax by steamers, just as the\r\n    news from Mexico was brought to New Orleans. Mr. Beach’s energy\r\n    found a successful field in establishing expresses brought by\r\n    messengers on horseback from Halifax to Boston and from New\r\n    Orleans to Montgomery, thus bringing the news of Europe and\r\n    the news of the Mexican War to New York much earlier than they\r\n    could have arrived by the ordinary public conveyance. With him\r\n    were associated, sooner or later, two or three of the other\r\n    New York papers; but the energy with which he carried through\r\n    the undertaking made him a conspicuous and distinguished\r\n    figure in the journalism of the city. The final result was the\r\n    organization of the New York Associated Press, which has now\r\n    become a world-embracing establishment for the collection of\r\n    news of every description, which it furnishes to its members in\r\n    this city and to other newspapers in every part of the country.\r\n    Under the stimulus of Mr. Beach’s energetic intellect, aided by\r\n    the cheapness of its price, the _Sun_ became in his hands an\r\n    important and profitable establishment. Yet he is scarcely to\r\n    be classed among the prominent journalists of his day.\r\n\r\nThrough conservatism, good business sense, and steady work, Moses Y.\r\nBeach amassed from the _Sun_ what was then a handsome fortune, and when\r\nhe retired he was only forty-eight. His last years were spent at the\r\ntown of his birth, Wallingford, where he died on July 19, 1868, six\r\nmonths after the _Sun_ had passed out of the hands of a Beach and into\r\nthe hands of a Dana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_From Photo in the Possession of Mrs. Jennie Beach Gasper_)\r\n\r\n  ALFRED ELY BEACH\r\n    A Son of Moses Y. Beach; He Left “The Sun” to Conduct the\r\n    “Scientific American.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nBeach Brothers, as the new ownership of the _Sun_ was entitled, made\r\nbut one important change in the appearance and character of the paper\r\nduring the next few years.\r\n\r\nUp to the coming of the telegraph the _Sun_ had devoted its first page\r\nto advertising, with a spice of reading-matter that usually was in the\r\nform of reprint--miscellany, as some newspapermen call it, or bogus, as\r\nmost printers term it. But when telegraphic news came to be common but\r\ncostly, newspapers began to see the importance of attracting the casual\r\nreader by means of display on the front page. The Beaches presently\r\nused one or two columns of the latest telegraph-matter on the first\r\npage; sometimes the whole page would be so occupied.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, from July to December, they issued an _Evening Sun_, which\r\ncarried no advertising.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 1852, Alfred Ely Beach, more concerned with scientific\r\nmatters than with the routine of daily publication, withdrew from the\r\n_Sun_, which passed into the sole possession of Moses S. Beach, then\r\nonly thirty years old. It was reported that when the partnership was\r\ndissolved the division was based on a total valuation of two hundred\r\nand fifty thousand dollars for the paper which, less than nineteen\r\nyears before, Ben Day had started with an old hand-press and a hatful\r\nof type. Horace Greeley, telling a committee of the British parliament\r\nabout American newspapers, named that sum as the amount for which the\r\n_Sun_ was valued in the sale by brother to brother.\r\n\r\n“It was very cheap,” he added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n“THE SUN” DURING THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\n  _One of the Few Entirely Loyal Newspapers of New York.--Its Brief\r\n    Ownership by a Religious Coterie.--It Returns to the Possession\r\n    of M. S. Beach, Who Sells It to Dana._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1852, when Moses Sperry Beach came into the sole ownership of the\r\n_Sun_, it was supposed that the slavery question had been settled\r\nforever, or at least with as much finality as was possible in\r\ndetermining such a problem. The Missouri Compromise, devised by Henry\r\nClay, had acted as a legislative mandragora which lulled the United\r\nStates and soothed the spasms of the extreme Abolitionists. Even\r\nAbraham Lincoln, now passing forty years, was losing that interest in\r\npolitics which he had once exhibited, and was devoting himself almost\r\nentirely to his law practice in Springfield, Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had plenty of news to fill its four wide pages, and its daily\r\ncirculation was above fifty thousand. The Erie Railroad had stretched\r\nitself from Piermont, on the Hudson River, to Dunkirk, on the shore of\r\nLake Erie. The Hudson River Railroad was built from New York to Albany.\r\nThe steamship Pacific, of the Collins Line, had broken the record by\r\ncrossing the Atlantic in nine days and nineteen hours. The glorious\r\nyacht America had beaten the British Titania by eight miles in a race\r\nof eighty miles.\r\n\r\nKossuth, come as the envoy plenipotentiary of a Hungary ambitious for\r\nfreedom, was New York’s hero. Lola Montez, the champion heart-breaker\r\nof her century, danced hither and yon. The volunteer firemen of New\r\nYork ran with their engines and broke one another’s heads. The Young\r\nMen’s Christian Association, designed to divert youth to gentler\r\npractices, was organized, and held its first international convention\r\nat Buffalo in 1854. Lieutenant Ulysses S. Grant, of the United States\r\narmy, was in California, recently the scene of the struggle between\r\noutlawry and the Vigilantes, and was not very sure that he liked the\r\nlife of a soldier.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Heenan, Morrissey, and Yankee Sullivan furnished, at frequent\r\nintervals, inspiration to American youth. The cholera attacked New York\r\nregularly, and as regularly did the _Sun_ print its prescription for\r\ncholera medicine, which George W. Busteed, a druggist, had given to\r\nMoses Yale Beach in 1849, and which is still in use for the subjugation\r\nof inward qualms. The elder Beach, enjoying himself in Europe with his\r\nson Joseph Beach, sent articles on French and German life to his son\r\nMoses Sperry Beach’s paper.\r\n\r\nLiterature was still advancing in New England. Persons of refinement\r\nwere reading Hawthorne’s “Scarlet Letter” and “The House of Seven\r\nGables,” Ik Marvel’s “Reveries of a Bachelor,” Irving’s “Mahomet,” and\r\nParkman’s “Conspiracy of Pontiac.” Marion Harland had written “Alone.”\r\nDown in Kentucky young Mary Jane Holmes was at work on her first novel,\r\n“Tempest and Sunshine.” But brows both high and low were bent over the\r\ninstalments in the _National Era_ of the most fascinating story of the\r\nperiod, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”\r\n\r\nThe writing of news had not gone far ahead in quality. Most of the\r\nreporters still wrote in a groove a century old. Every chicken-thief\r\nwho was shot, “clapped his hand to his heart, cried out that he was a\r\ndead man, and presently expired.” But the editorial articles were well\r\nwritten. On the _Sun_ John Vance, a brilliant Irishman, was turning out\r\nmost of the leaders and getting twenty dollars a week. In the _Tribune_\r\noffice Greeley pounded rum and slavery, while his chief assistant,\r\nCharles A. Dana, did such valuable work on foreign and domestic\r\npolitical articles that his salary grew to the huge figure of fifty\r\ndollars a week.\r\n\r\nBennett was working harder than any other newspaper-owner, and was\r\ndoing big things for the _Herald_. Southern interests and scandal\r\nwere his long suits. “We call the _Herald_ a very bad paper,” said\r\nGreeley to a Parliamentary committee which was inquiring about American\r\nnewspapers. He meant that it was naughty; but naughtiness and all, its\r\ncirculation was only half as big as the _Sun’s_.\r\n\r\nHenry J. Raymond was busy with his new venture, the _Times_, launched\r\nby him and George Jones, the banker. With Raymond were associated\r\neditorially Alexander C. Wilson and James W. Simonton. William Cullen\r\nBryant, nearing sixty, still bent “the good grey head that all men\r\nknew” over his editor’s desk in the office of the _Evening Post_. With\r\nhim, as partner and managing editor, was that other great American,\r\nJohn Bigelow.\r\n\r\nJ. Watson Webb, fiery as ever in spirit, still ran the _Courier and\r\nEnquirer_, “the Austrian organ in Wall Street,” as Raymond called\r\nit because of Webb’s hostile attitude toward Kossuth. Webb had been\r\nminister to Austria, a post for which Raymond was afterward to be\r\nnominated but not confirmed. The newspapers and the people were all\r\npretty well satisfied with themselves. And then Stephen A. Douglas put\r\nhis foot in it, and Kansas began to bleed.\r\n\r\nDouglas had been one of the _Sun’s_ great men, for the _Sun_ listed\r\nheavily toward the Democratic party nationally; but it did not disguise\r\nits dislike of the Little Giant’s unhappily successful effort to\r\norganize the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska on the principle of\r\nsquatter sovereignty. After the peace and quiet that had followed the\r\nMissouri Compromise, this attempt to bring slavery across the line of\r\nthirty-six degrees and thirty minutes by means of a local-option scheme\r\nlooked to the _Sun_ very much like kicking a sleeping dragon in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAfter Douglas had been successful in putting his bill through\r\nCongress, the _Sun_ still rejected its principles. Commenting on the\r\nannouncements of certain Missourians that they would take their slaves\r\ninto the new Territory, the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    They may certainly take their slaves with them into the new\r\n    Territory, but when they get them there they will have no law\r\n    for holding the slaves. Slavery is a creation of local law,\r\n    and until a Legislature of Kansas or Nebraska enacts a law\r\n    recognizing slavery, all slaves taken into the Territory will\r\n    be entitled to their freedom.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the germs of Secession began to show\r\nthemselves on the culture-plates of the continent. The _Sun_ was hot at\r\nthe suggestion of a division of the Union:\r\n\r\n    It can only excite contempt when any irate member of Congress\r\n    or fanatical newspaper treats the dissolution of the Union as\r\n    an event which may easily be brought about. There is moral\r\n    treason in this habit of continually depreciating the value of\r\n    the Union.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ saw that Douglas’s repeal of the Missouri Compromise was a\r\nsmashing blow delivered by a Northern Democrat to the Democracy of the\r\nNorth; but the sectional hatred was not revealed in all its intensity\r\nuntil 1856, when Representative Preston S. Brooks, of South Carolina,\r\nmade his murderous attack on Senator Charles Sumner, of Massachusetts,\r\nin the Senate Chamber. This and its immediate consequences were well\r\ncovered by the _Sun_, not only through its Associated Press despatches,\r\nbut also in special correspondence from its Washington representative,\r\n“Hermit.” It had a report nearly a column long of Sumner’s speech,\r\n“The Crime Against Kansas,” which caused Brooks to assault the great\r\nopponent of slavery.\r\n\r\nThat year was also the year of the first national convention of the\r\nRepublican party, conceived by the Abolitionists, the Free Soilers, and\r\nthe Know-nothings, and born in 1854. The _Sun_ had a special reporter\r\nat Philadelphia to tell of the nomination of John C. Frémont, but\r\nthe paper supported Buchanan. Its readers were of a class naturally\r\nDemocratic, and although the paper was not a party organ, and had no\r\nliking for slavery or Secession, the new party was too new, perhaps too\r\nmuch colored with Know-nothingism, to warrant a change of policy.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the Dred Scott decision, written by Chief Justice\r\nTaney and handed down two days after Buchanan’s inauguration, the _Sun_\r\nwas blunt:\r\n\r\n    We believe that the State of New York can confer citizenship on\r\n    men of whatever race, and that its citizens are entitled, by\r\n    the Constitution, to be treated in Missouri as citizens of New\r\n    York State. To treat them otherwise is to discredit our State\r\n    sovereignty.\r\n\r\nJohn Brown’s raid at Harper’s Ferry was found worthy of a column in the\r\n_Sun_, but space was cramped that morning, for four columns had to be\r\ngiven to a report of the New York firemen’s parade. The firemen read\r\nthe _Sun_.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Beach sent a special man to report Brown’s trial at\r\nCharlestown, Virginia. The editorial columns echoed the sense of the\r\ncorrespondence--that the old man was not having a fair show. Besides,\r\nthe _Sun_ believed that Brown was insane and belonged in a madhouse\r\nrather than on the gallows. It printed a five-thousand-word sermon\r\nby Henry Ward Beecher on Brown’s raid. Beecher and the Beaches were\r\nvery friendly, and there is still in Beecher’s famous Plymouth Church,\r\nBrooklyn, a pulpit made of wood brought from the Mount of Olives by\r\nMoses S. Beach.\r\n\r\nWhen John Brown was hanged, December 2, 1859, the _Sun_ remarked:\r\n\r\n    The chivalry of the Old Dominion will breathe easier now....\r\n    But, while Brown cannot be regarded as a common murderer, it is\r\n    only the wild extravagance of fanatical zeal that will attempt\r\n    to elevate him to the rank of a martyr.\r\n\r\nIn the Illinois campaign of 1858 the _Sun_ was slow to recognize\r\nAbraham Lincoln’s prowess as a speaker, although Lincoln was then\r\nrecognized as the leading exponent of Whig doctrine in his State.\r\nReferring to the debates between Lincoln and Douglas in their struggle\r\nfor the Senatorship, the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    An extraordinary interest is attached by the leading men of all\r\n    parties to the campaign which Senator Douglas is conducting in\r\n    the State of Illinois. His rival for the Senatorial nomination,\r\n    Mr. Lincoln, being no match for the Little Giant in campaign\r\n    oratory, Senator Trumbull has taken the stump on the Republican\r\n    side.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, when Lincoln was nominated for President, the _Sun_\r\nsaw him in a somewhat different light:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lincoln is an active State politician and a good stump\r\n    orator. As to the chances of his election, that is a matter\r\n    upon which we need not at present speculate.\r\n\r\nBut the time for the _Sun_ to speculate came only three days later (May\r\n22, 1860), when it frankly stated:\r\n\r\n    It is now admitted that Mr. Lincoln’s nomination is a strong\r\n    one.... He is, emphatically, a man of the people.... That he\r\n    would, if elected, make a good President, we do not entertain a\r\n    doubt. His chances of election are certainly good. The people\r\n    are tired of being ruled by professional politicians.\r\n\r\nThat was written before the Democratic national convention. The _Sun_\r\nwanted the Democrats to nominate Sam Houston. It saw that Douglas had\r\nestranged the anti-slavery Democrats of the North. When Douglas was\r\nnominated, the _Sun_ remarked:\r\n\r\n    Of the six candidates in the field--Lincoln, Bell, Houston,\r\n    Douglas, Breckinridge, and Gerrit Smith--Lincoln has\r\n    unquestionably the best chance of an election by the people.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had no illusions as to the candidacy of John C. Breckinridge,\r\nthe Vice-President under Buchanan, when he was nominated for President\r\nby the Democrats of the South, who refused to flock to the colours of\r\nDouglas:\r\n\r\n    The secessionists do not expect that Breckinridge will be\r\n    elected. Should Lincoln and Hamlin be elected by the votes of\r\n    the free States, then the design of the conspirators is to come\r\n    out openly for a disruption of the Union and the erection of a\r\n    Southern confederacy.\r\n\r\n“The Union cannot be dissolved,” the _Sun_ declared on August 4,\r\n“whosoever shall be elected President!”\r\n\r\nAnd on the morning of Election Day the _Sun_, which had taken little\r\npart except to criticise the conduct of the Democratic campaign, said\r\nprophetically: “History turns a leaf to-day.” Its comment on the\r\nmorning after the election was characteristic of its attitude during\r\nthe canvass:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Lincoln appears to have been elected, and yet the country\r\n    is safe.\r\n\r\nIn a paragraph of political gossip printed a week later the _Sun_ said\r\nthat Horace Greeley could have the collectorship of the port of New\r\nYork if he resigned his claims to a seat in the Cabinet, and that--\r\n\r\n    For the postmastership Charles A. Dana of the _Tribune_,\r\n    Daniel Ullman, Thomas B. Stillman, and Armor J. Williamson are\r\n    named. Either Mr. Dana or Mr. Williamson would fill the office\r\n    creditably.\r\n\r\nThat was probably the first time that Charles A. Dana got his name into\r\nthe _Sun_.\r\n\r\nAlthough unqualifiedly opposed to Secession, the _Sun_ did not believe\r\nthat military coercion was the best way to prevent it. It saw the\r\ntemper of South Carolina and other Southern States, but thought that it\r\nsaw, too, a diplomatic way of curing the disorder. South Carolina, it\r\nsaid, had a greater capacity for indignation than any other political\r\nbody in the world. Here was the way to stop its wrath:\r\n\r\n    Open the door of the Union for a free and inglorious egress,\r\n    and you dry up the machine in an instant.\r\n\r\nThis was somewhat on a plane with Horace Greeley’s advice in the\r\n_Tribune_--“Let the erring sisters go in peace.” The _Sun_, however,\r\nwas more Machiavellian:\r\n\r\n    Our proposition is that the Constitution be so amended as\r\n    to permit any State, within a limited period, and upon her\r\n    surrender of her share in the Federal property, to retire\r\n    from the confederacy [the Union] in peace. It is a plan to\r\n    emasculate Secession by depriving it of its present stimulating\r\n    illegality. Does any one suppose that even South Carolina would\r\n    withdraw from the Union if her withdrawal were normal?\r\n\r\nThis was printed on December 8, 1860, some weeks before the fate of the\r\nCrittenden Compromise, beaten by Southern votes, showed beyond doubt\r\nthat the South actually preferred disunion.\r\n\r\nWith mingled grief and indignation the _Sun_ watched the Southern\r\nStates march out of the Union. It poured its wrath on the head of\r\nthe mayor of New York, Fernando Wood, when that peculiar statesman\r\nsuggested, on January 7, 1861, that New York City should also secede.\r\n“Why may not New York disrupt the bonds which bind her to a venal and\r\ncorrupt master?” Wood had inquired.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had more faith in Lincoln than most of its Democratic\r\ncontemporaries exhibited. Of his inaugural speech it said:\r\n\r\n    There is a manly sincerity, geniality, and strength to be felt\r\n    in the whole address.\r\n\r\nThe day after the fall of Fort Sumter the _Sun_ found a moment to turn\r\non the South-loving _Herald_:\r\n\r\n    We state only what the proprietor of the _Herald_ undoubtedly\r\n    believes when we say that if the national ensign had not been\r\n    hung out yesterday from its windows, as a concession to the\r\n    gathering crowd, the issue of that paper for another day would\r\n    have been more than doubtful.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward the _Sun_ charged that the _Herald_ had had in\r\nits office a full set of Confederate colours, “ready to fling to the\r\nbreeze of treason which it and the mayor hoped to raise in this city.”\r\nLater in the same year the _Sun_ accused the _Daily News_ and the\r\n_Staats-Zeitung_ of disloyalty, and intimated that the _Journal of\r\nCommerce_ and the _Express_ were not what they should be. The owner\r\nof the _Daily News_ was Ben Wood, a brother of Fernando Wood. In its\r\nyouth the _News_ had been a newspaper of considerable distinction. It\r\nwas an offshoot of the _Evening Post_, and one of its first editors was\r\nParke Godwin, son-in-law of William Cullen Bryant. Another of its early\r\neditors was Samuel J. Tilden.\r\n\r\nWood, who was a Kentuckian by birth, made the _News_ a Tammany organ\r\nand used it to get himself elected to Congress, where he served as a\r\nRepresentative from 1861 to 1865, constantly opposing the continuation\r\nof the war. The _Sun’s_ accusation of disloyalty against the _News_\r\nwas echoed in Washington, and for eighteen months, early in the war,\r\nthe _News_ was suppressed. The _Staats-Zeitung_, also included in the\r\n_Sun’s_ suspicion, was then owned by Oswald Ottendorfer, who had come\r\ninto possession of the great German daily in 1859, by his marriage to\r\nMrs. Jacob Uhl, widow of the man who established it as a daily.\r\n\r\nPresence in the ranks of the copperhead journalists was disastrous to\r\nthe owner of the _Journal of Commerce_, Gerard Hallock, who had been\r\none of the great figures of American journalism for thirty years. In\r\nthe decade before the war Hallock bought and liberated at least a\r\nhundred slaves, and paid for their transportation to Liberia; yet he\r\nwas one of the most uncompromising supporters of a national proslavery\r\npolicy. When the American Home Missionary Society withdrew its support\r\nfrom slave-holding churches in the South, Hallock was one of the\r\nfounders of the Southern Aid Society, designed to take its place.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1861, the _Journal of Commerce_ was one of several\r\nnewspapers presented by the grand jury of the United States Circuit\r\nCourt for “encouraging rebels now in arms against the Federal\r\ngovernment, by expressing sympathy and agreement with them.” Hallock’s\r\npaper was forbidden the use of the mails. He sold his interest in the\r\n_Journal of Commerce_, retired from business, never wrote another line\r\nfor publication, and died four years later.\r\n\r\nAnother contemporary of the _Sun_ which suffered during the war was\r\nthe _World_, then a very young paper. It had first appeared in June,\r\n1860, as a highly moral daily sheet. Its express purpose was to give\r\nall the news that it thought the public _ought_ to have. This meant\r\nthat it intended to exclude from its staid columns all thrilling police\r\nreports, slander suits, divorce cases, and details of murders. It\r\nrefused to print theatrical advertising.\r\n\r\nThe _World_ had a fast printing-press and obtained an Associated Press\r\nfranchise. It hired some good men, including Alexander Cummings, who\r\nhad made his mark on the Philadelphia _North American_, James R.\r\nSpalding, who had been with Raymond on the _Courier and Enquirer_, and\r\nManton Marble. But the _World_, stripped of lively human news, was a\r\nfailure. After two hundred thousand dollars had been sunk in a footless\r\nenterprise, the religious coterie retired, and left the _World_ to the\r\nworldly.\r\n\r\nIts later owners were variously reported to be August Belmont, Fernando\r\nWood, and Benjamin Wood; but it finally passed entirely into the hands\r\nof Manton Marble, who made it a free-trade Democratic organ. Marble had\r\nlearned the newspaper business on the _Journal_ and the _Traveler_\r\nin Boston, and in 1858 and 1859 he was on the staff of the _Evening\r\nPost_. In July, 1861, the _World_ and the _Courier and Enquirer_ were\r\nconsolidated, and Colonel J. Watson Webb, who had owned and edited the\r\nlatter paper for thirty-four years, retired from newspaper life.\r\n\r\nDuring the Civil War the _World_ was strongly opposed to President\r\nLincoln’s administration. Perhaps this fact accounts for the punishment\r\nwhich befell it through the misdeed of an outsider.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1864, there was sent to most of the morning-newspaper offices\r\nwhat purported to be a proclamation by the President, appointing a\r\nday of fasting and prayer, and calling into military service, by\r\nvolunteering and draft, four hundred thousand additional troops. This\r\nwas a fake, engineered by Joseph Howard, Jr., a newspaperman who had\r\nbeen employed on the _Tribune_, and who put out the hoax for the\r\npurpose of influencing the stock-market. The _Sun_, the _Tribune_, and\r\nthe _Times_ did not fall for the hoax, but the _Herald_, the _World_,\r\nand the _Journal of Commerce_ printed it, stopping their presses when\r\nthey learned the truth.\r\n\r\nGeneral John A. Dix seized the offices of the _Herald_, the _World_,\r\nand the _Journal of Commerce_, put soldiers to guard them, and\r\nsuppressed the papers for several days--all this by order of the\r\nPresident. Howard, the forger, was arrested, and on his confession was\r\nsent to Fort Lafayette, where he was a prisoner for several weeks.\r\nManton Marble wrote a bitter letter to Lincoln in protest against what\r\nhe considered an outrage on the _World_. Marble remained at the head of\r\nthe paper until 1876.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ took the setback of Bull Run with better grace than most of\r\nthe papers--far better than Horace Greeley, who yelled for a truce. It\r\nseemed to see that this was only the beginning of a long conflict,\r\nwhich must be fought to the end, regardless of disappointments. On\r\nAugust 15, 1861, it declared:\r\n\r\n    Let there be but one war. Better it should cost millions\r\n    of lives than that we should live in hourly dread of wars,\r\n    contiguous to a people who could make foreign alliances and\r\n    land armies upon our shores to destroy our liberties.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the war’s cost it said:\r\n\r\n    No more talk of carrying on the war economically! The only\r\n    economy is to make short and swift work of it, and the people\r\n    are ready to bear the expense, if it were five hundred millions\r\n    of dollars, to-day.\r\n\r\nThis was printed when the war was very young; when no man dreamed that\r\nit would cost the Federal government six times five hundred millions.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ editorial articles were not without criticism of the\r\nconduct of the war. It was one of the many papers that demanded the\r\nresignation of Seward at a time when the Secretary of State was\r\ngenerally blamed for what seemed to be the dilly-dallying of the\r\ngovernment. Lincoln himself was still regarded as a politician as well\r\nas a statesman--a view which was reflected in the _Sun’s_ comment on\r\nthe preliminary proclamation of emancipation, September 22, 1862:\r\n\r\n    As the greatest and most momentous act of our nation, from its\r\n    foundation to the present time, we would rather have seen this\r\n    step disconnected from all lesser considerations and from party\r\n    influences.\r\n\r\nThe inference in this was that Lincoln had deliberately made his great\r\nstroke on the eve of the Republican State convention in New York.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ declared that the proclamation was “the beginning of the\r\nend of the rebellion.” “The wisdom of the step is unquestionable,” said\r\nthe _Times_; “its necessity indisputable.” The businesslike _Herald_\r\nremarked that it inaugurated “an overwhelming revolution in the system\r\nof labour.” The _World_ said that it regretted the proclamation and\r\ndoubted the President’s power to free the slaves. “We regard it with\r\nprofound regret,” said the _Journal of Commerce_. “It is usurpation of\r\npower!” shouted the _Staats-Zeitung_.\r\n\r\nSuch was the general tone of the New York morning newspapers during\r\nthe war. Only three--the _Sun_, the _Tribune_, and the _Times_--could\r\nbe described as out-and-out loyalists. The _Sun_ was for backing up\r\nLincoln whenever it believed him right, and that was most of the time;\r\nyet it was free in its criticism of various phases of the conduct of\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\nLike most of the Democrats of New York, the _Sun_ was an admirer of\r\nGeneral McClellan, and it believed that his removal from the command\r\nof the army was due to politics. But when the election of 1864 came\r\naround, the _Sun_ refused to join its party contemporaries in wild\r\nabuse of Lincoln and Johnson. On the morning after the Republican\r\nnominations it said:\r\n\r\n    It is no time to quarrel with those men who honestly wish to\r\n    crush the rebellion on the ground that they have nominated a\r\n    rail-splitter and a tailor. It would be more consistent with\r\n    true democracy if these men were honored for rising from an\r\n    humble sphere.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ supported McClellan, praising him for his repudiation of the\r\nplank in the Democratic platform which declared the war a failure; but\r\nin the last days of the campaign it was frank in its predictions that\r\nLincoln would be elected. On the morning after election it had this to\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n    The reelection of Abraham Lincoln announces to the world how\r\n    firmly we have resolved to be a free and united people.\r\n\r\nAfter the assassination of President Lincoln the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    In the death of Mr. Lincoln the Southern people have lost\r\n    one of the best friends they had at the North. He would have\r\n    treated them with more gentleness than any other statesman.\r\n    From him they would have obtained concessions it is now almost\r\n    impossible for our rulers and people to grant.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ attitude toward the copperheads and deluded pacifists of\r\nthe North is reflected in an editorial article published on June 5,\r\n1863. The North was then in its worst panic. Only a month previously\r\nLee had defeated Hooker at Chancellorsville, and the victorious\r\nConfederates were marching through Maryland into Pennsylvania. At\r\na mass-meeting in Cooper Union, George Francis Train and other\r\ncopperheads denounced the war, praised Vallandigham, of Ohio, who had\r\nbeen banished into the South for his unpatriotic conduct, and declared\r\nfor “peace and reunion.” It was largely a Democratic meeting, but the\r\n_Sun_ would not stomach the disloyal outburst:\r\n\r\n    The fact that over ten thousand people assembled in and about\r\n    Cooper Union on Thursday evening to listen to speeches and\r\n    adopt an address and resolutions prepared under that “eye\r\n    single to the public welfare,” discloses the ease with which\r\n    a few political tricksters may present false issues to the\r\n    unthinking and, in the excitement of the moment, induce their\r\n    hearers to applaud sentiments that, when calmly considered,\r\n    are unworthy of a great and free people. Taking advantage of\r\n    the blunders of the present administration, these self-styled\r\n    Democrats raise their banners and, under the guise of\r\n    proclaiming peace, in reality proclaim a war upon those very\r\n    principles it is the highest boast of every true Democrat to\r\n    acknowledge.\r\n\r\n    The Democratic party is essentially the peace party of the\r\n    present rebellion; but it will sanction no peace that is\r\n    obtained by compromising the vital principles that give force\r\n    to our form of government. They will not ask for peace at the\r\n    expense of the Union, and desire no Democratic victories that\r\n    do not legitimately belong to them as an expression of the\r\n    confidence of the people in their fidelity to the Union and the\r\n    Constitution.\r\n\r\n    The late meeting, then, should not be sanctioned by any true\r\n    Democrat. It was in no sense Democratic; it was in reality an\r\n    opposition meeting, and only as such will it be looked upon as\r\n    having any important bearing upon the great questions of the\r\n    hour, and if rightly interpreted by the administration will\r\n    exert no evil influence upon the future destinies of this great\r\n    nation.\r\n\r\nThe methods of gathering war news, early in the conflict, were\r\nhaphazard. The first reports to reach New York from Southern fields\r\nwere usually the government bulletins, but they were not as trustworthy\r\nas the official bulletins of the European war.\r\n\r\nOn the morning after the first battle of Bull Run, the _Sun’s_ readers\r\nwere treated to joyous head-lines:\r\n\r\n    A GREAT BATTLE--SEVENTY THOUSAND REBELS IN IT--OUR ARMY\r\n    VICTORIOUS--GREAT LOSS OF LIFE--TWELVE HOURS’ FIGHTING--RETREAT\r\n    OF THE REBELS--UNITED STATES FORCES PRESSING FORWARD.\r\n\r\nBut on the following morning the tune changed:\r\n\r\n    RETREAT OF OUR TROOPS--OUR ARMY SCATTERED--ONLY TWENTY-TWO\r\n    THOUSAND UNION TROOPS ENGAGED--ENEMY NINETY THOUSAND\r\n    STRONG--OUR CANNON LEFT BEHIND.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, only about eighteen thousand troops were engaged\r\non each side.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had no famous correspondents at the front. It sent three\r\nreporters to Virginia in 1861, and these sent mail stories and some\r\ntelegraph matter, which was of value in supplementing the official\r\nbulletins, the Associated Press service, the specials from “Nemo”\r\nand “Hermit,” the _Sun_ correspondents in Washington, and the matter\r\nrewritten from the Philadelphia and Western newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ was still a local paper, with a constituency hungry for news\r\nof the men of the New York regiments. To the _Sun_ readers the doings\r\nof General Meagher, of the Irish Brigade, or Colonel Michael Corcoran,\r\nof the Sixty-Ninth Regiment, were more important than the strategic\r\ndetails of a large campaign.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_, like all the Northern papers, was frequently deceived\r\nby false reports of Union victories. Federal troops were in\r\nFredericksburg--on the front page--weeks before they were in it in\r\nreality; in Richmond, years too soon. But there was no doubt about\r\nGettysburg, although the North did not get the news until the 5th of\r\nJuly. The _Sun_ came out on Monday, the 6th, with these head-lines:\r\n\r\n    VICTORY!--INVASION COMES TO GRIEF--LEE UTTERLY ROUTED--HIS\r\n    DISASTROUS RETREAT--ALL FEDERAL PRISONERS RECAPTURED--EIGHTEEN\r\n    THOUSAND PRISONERS CAPTURED--MEANS OF ESCAPE DESTROYED.\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1865, the head-lines were sprinkled with American flags\r\nand cuts of Columbia, and the types carried the welcome news for which\r\nthe North had waited for four long years:\r\n\r\n    OUR NATION REDEEMED--SURRENDER OF LEE AND HIS WHOLE ARMY--THE\r\n    TERMS--OFFICERS AND MEN PAROLED AND TOLD TO GO HOME--THE\r\n    COUNTRY WILD WITH JOY, ETC., ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\nThe “etc., etc., etc.,” suggests that the head-writer was too wild with\r\njoy to go into more details.\r\n\r\nIt was not until May, 1862, that the _Sun_ abandoned the ancient custom\r\nof giving a large part of the first page to advertising. This reform\r\ncame late, perhaps because Moses S. Beach was out of the _Sun_ in the\r\nearly months of the war.\r\n\r\nOn August 6, 1860, the control of the paper had passed from Mr. Beach\r\nto Archibald M. Morrison, a rich young man of religious fervour, who\r\nwas prompted by other religious enthusiasts to get the _Sun_ and use\r\nit for evangelical purposes. Mr. Morrison gave Mr. Beach one hundred\r\nthousand dollars for the good-will of the paper, and agreed to pay\r\na rental for the material. Mr. Beach retained the ownership of the\r\nbuilding, of the presses, and, indeed, of every piece of type.\r\n\r\nThe new proprietors of the _Sun_ held a prayer-meeting at noon every\r\nday in the editorial rooms. They also injected a bit of religion into\r\nthe columns by printing on the first page reports of prayer-meetings\r\nin the Sailors’ Home and of the doings of missionaries in Syria and\r\nelsewhere. In spite of the new spirit that pervaded the office,\r\nhowever, it was still possible for the unregenerate old subscriber to\r\nfind some little space devoted to the fistic clashes of Heenan and\r\nMorrissey. Flies are not caught with vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe new management made a sort of department paper of the _Sun_, the\r\nfront page being divided with the headings “Financial,” “Religious,”\r\n“Criminal,” “Calamities,” “Foreign Items,” “Business Items,” and\r\n“Miscellaneous.” It was not a bad newspaper, and it was quite possible\r\nthat some business men would prefer it to the Beach kind of sheet; but\r\nit is certain that the advertisers were not attracted and that some\r\nreaders were repelled. One of the latter climbed the stairs of the\r\nbuilding at Fulton and Nassau Streets early one morning and nailed\r\nto the door of the editorial rooms a placard which read: “Be ye not\r\nrighteous overmuch!”\r\n\r\nDuring the Morrison régime the _Sun_ refused to accept advertisements\r\non Sunday. Of course, the printers worked on Sunday night, getting out\r\nMonday’s paper, but that was something else. The _Sun_ went so far\r\n(July 23, 1861) as to urge that the Union generals should be forbidden\r\nto attack the enemy on Sundays. “Our troops must have rest, and need\r\nthe Sabbath,” it said.\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Church, one of the rising young newspapermen of New York,\r\nwas induced to become the publisher under the _Sun’s_ new management.\r\nHe was only twenty-four years old, but he had had a good deal of\r\nnewspaper experience in assisting his father, the Rev. Pharcellus\r\nChurch, to edit and publish the New York _Chronicle_. After a few weeks\r\nin the _Sun_ office, however, Mr. Church saw that the paper, though\r\ndaily treated with evangelical serum, was not likely to be a howling\r\nsuccess; and on December 10, 1860, four months after he took hold as\r\npublisher, it was announced that Mr. Church had “withdrawn from the\r\npublication of the _Sun_ for the purpose of spending some months in\r\nEuropean travel and correspondence for the paper.”\r\n\r\nMr. Church wrote a few letters from Europe, but when the Civil War\r\nstarted he hurried home and went with the joint military and naval\r\nexpedition headed by General T. W. Sherman and Admiral S. F. Dupont.\r\nHe was present at the capture of Port Royal, and wrote for the\r\n_Evening Post_ the first account of it that appeared in the North.\r\nLater he acted as a war-correspondent of the _Times_, writing under the\r\npseudonym “Pierrepont.” In October, 1862, he was appointed a captain of\r\nvolunteers, and toward the close of the war he received the brevets of\r\nmajor and lieutenant-colonel.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Mr. Church and his brother, Francis Pharcellus Church,\r\nestablished the _Army and Navy Journal_, and in 1866 they founded that\r\nbrilliant magazine, the _Galaxy_--later merged with the _Atlantic\r\nMonthly_--which printed the early works of Henry James. Colonel Church\r\nowned the _Army and Navy Journal_, and was its active editor, until his\r\ndeath, May 23, 1917, at the age of eighty-one. He was the biographer\r\nand literary executor of John Ericsson, the inventor, and he wrote also\r\na biography of General Grant. He and his brother Francis were the most\r\ndistinguished members of a family which, in its various branches, gave\r\nno less than seventeen persons to literature.\r\n\r\nFrancis P. Church’s connection with the _Sun_ was longer and more\r\npleasant than William’s. His writings for it ranged over a period of\r\nforty years. He was one of the _Sun’s_ greatest editorial writers, and\r\nwas the author of the most popular editorial article ever written--“Is\r\nThere a Santa Claus?” But that comes in a later and far more brilliant\r\nperiod than the one in which William C. Church served the _Sun_ all too\r\nbriefly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1861, what with the expense of getting war news, and\r\nperhaps with the reluctance of the readers to absorb piety, the _Sun’s_\r\ncash-drawer began to warp from lack of weight, and Mr. Beach, who had\r\nnever relinquished his rights to all the physical part of the paper,\r\ntook it back. This is the way he announced his resumption of control on\r\nNew Year’s morning, 1862:\r\n\r\n    Once more I write myself editor and sole proprietor of the\r\n    New York _Sun_. My day-dream of rural enjoyment is broken,\r\n    and I am again prisoner to pen and types. For months I sought\r\n    to avoid the surrender, but only to find resistance without\r\n    avail.... But I congratulate myself on my surroundings. Never\r\n    was prisoner more royally treated.\r\n\r\n    What, then, to the readers of the _Sun_? Nothing save the\r\n    announcement that I am henceforth its publisher and manager.\r\n    They require no other prospectus, program, or platform.\r\n\r\n                                        MOSES S. BEACH.\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Vance, who is said to have worked twelve years without a vacation,\r\nleft the _Sun_ about that time because Mr. Beach refused to name him as\r\neditor-in-chief. Vance was a good writer, but he and Beach were often\r\nat odds over the _Sun’s_ policies. It probably was Vance’s influence\r\nthat kept the paper in line for Douglas in the Presidential campaign of\r\n1860--a campaign in which the _Sun_ was run for two months by Beach and\r\nfor three months by the Morrisonites. Vance, in spite of his leaning\r\ntoward Douglas, was an intimate friend of Elihu Burritt, the Learned\r\nBlacksmith, who was an Abolitionist and an advocate of universal\r\nbrotherhood.\r\n\r\nOn Beach’s return to the _Sun_ he set out to recover its lost\r\nadvertising and to restore some of the livelier news features that had\r\nbeen suppressed by the Morrison group. Early in the summer of 1862 he\r\nbegan to shift advertising from the front page, to make room for the\r\nbig war head-lines that had been run on the second page. He also used\r\nmaps and woodcuts of cities, ships, and generals. The _Sun’s_ pictures\r\nof the Monitor and the Merrimac were printed in one column by deftly\r\nstanding the gallant iron-clads on their sterns.\r\n\r\nIt was in this summer that Beach reduced expenses and speeded up the\r\nissue of the paper by adopting the stereotyping process, one of the\r\ngreatest advances in newspaper history:\r\n\r\n    About a week ago we commenced printing the _Sun_ by a new\r\n    process--that of stereotyping and printing with two presses. We\r\n    are much gratified to-day in being able to say that the process\r\n    has proved eminently successful. From this time forth we may\r\n    expect to present a clean face to our many readers every day.\r\n    We have completed one stereotype within seventeen minutes and a\r\n    quarter, and two within nineteen minutes and a half.\r\n\r\nThat was rapid work for 1862, but the stereotypers of the present\r\nday will take a form from the composing-room, make the papier-mâché\r\nimpression, pour in the molten metal, and have the curved plate ready\r\nfor the press in twelve minutes.\r\n\r\nThe new process saved Beach a lot of money as well as much precious\r\ntime. Before its coming, when the paper was printed directly from the\r\nface of the type, the _Sun_ had to buy a full new set of type six or\r\neight times a year, at an annual cost of six thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe war played havoc with newspaper finances. The price of news-print\r\npaper rose to twenty-four cents a pound. All the morning papers except\r\nthe _Sun_ raised their prices to three or four cents in 1862. The _Sun_\r\nstayed at its old penny.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1863, in order to meet advancing costs and still sell\r\nthe _Sun_ for one cent, Beach found it necessary to “remove one column\r\nfrom each side of the page”--a more or less ingenuous way of saying\r\nthat the _Sun_ was reduced from seven columns to five. The columns were\r\nshortened, too, and the whole paper was set in agate type. The _Sun_\r\nthen looked much as it had appeared twenty years before.\r\n\r\nWith these economies Beach was able to keep the price at one cent until\r\nAugust 1, 1864, when the _Sun_ slyly said:\r\n\r\n    We shall require the one cent for the _Sun_ to be paid in gold,\r\n    or we will receive as an equivalent two cents in currency.\r\n\r\n    Apologies or explanations are needless. An inflated currency\r\n    has raised the price of white paper nearly threefold.\r\n\r\nOf course nobody had one cent in gold, so the _Sun_ readers grinned and\r\npaid two cents in copper.\r\n\r\nFrom that day on the price of the _Sun_ was two cents until July 1,\r\n1916, when Frank A. Munsey bought the _Sun_, combined his one-cent\r\nnewspaper, the New York _Press_, with it, and reduced the price to\r\none cent. On January 26, 1918, by reason of heavy expenses incidental\r\nto the war, the _Sun_, with all the other large papers of New York,\r\nincreased its price to two cents a copy. In its eighty-five years\r\nthe _Sun_ has been a penny paper thirty-two years, a two-cent paper\r\nfifty-three years.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ was constantly profitable in the decade before the Civil\r\nWar. The average annual profits from 1850 to 1860 were $22,770.\r\nThe high-water mark in that period was reached in 1853, when the\r\nadvertising receipts were $89,964 and the net profits $42,906. Its\r\ncirculation in September, 1860, was fifty-nine thousand copies daily,\r\nof which forty-five thousand were sold on the island of Manhattan.\r\n\r\nOne of the secrets of the _Sun’s_ popularity in the years when it had\r\nno such news guidance as Bennett gave to the _Herald_, no such spirited\r\neditorials as Greeley put into the _Tribune_, no such political\r\nprestige as Raymond brought to the _Times_, was Moses S. Beach’s belief\r\nthat his public wanted light fiction. The appetite created by Scott\r\nand increased by Dickens was keen in America. True, the penny _Sun’s_\r\nliterary standards were not of Himalayan height. Hawthorne was too\r\nspiritual for its readers, Poe too brief. They wanted wads of adventure\r\nand dialogue, dour squires, swooning ladies, hellish villains, handsome\r\nheroes, and comic character folk. The young mechanic had to have\r\nsomething he could understand without knitting his brows. For him,\r\n“The Grocer’s Apprentice; a Tale of the Great Plague,” and “Dick Egan;\r\nor, the San Francisco Bandits,” written for the _Sun_ by H. Warren\r\nTrowbridge.\r\n\r\nIn the days before the Civil War, wives snatched the _Sun_ from\r\nhusbands to read “Maggie Miller; or, Old Hagar’s Secret,” “written\r\nexpressly for the _Sun_” by Mary J. Holmes, already famous through\r\n“Lena Rivers” and “Dora Deane.” Ephemeral? They are still reading “Lena\r\nRivers” in North Crossing, Nebraska.\r\n\r\nHoratio Alger, Jr., wrote several of his best tales for Mr. Beach, who\r\nprinted them serially in the _Sun_ and the _Weekly Sun_. To the New\r\nYork youth of 1859, who dreamed not that in three years he would be\r\nclay on the slope at Fredericksburg, it was the middle of a perfect day\r\nto pick up the _Sun_, read a thrilling news story about Blondin cooking\r\nan omelet while crossing the Niagara gorge on a tight rope, and then,\r\nturning to the last page, to plunge into “The Discarded Son; or, the\r\nCousin’s Plot,” by the author of “The Secret Drawer,” “The Cooper’s\r\nWard,” “The Gipsy Nurse,” and “Madeline the Temptress”--for all these\r\nwere written expressly for the _Sun_ by young Mr. Alger. He was only\r\ntwenty-five then, with the years ahead when, a Unitarian minister, he\r\nshould see fiction material in the New York street-boy and write the\r\nepics of _Ragged Dick_ and _Tattered Tom_.\r\n\r\nWhat did the women readers of the _Sun_ care about the discovery of oil\r\nin Pennsylvania or the wonderful trotting campaign of Flora Temple,\r\nwhen they could devour daily two columns of “Jessie Graham; or, Love\r\nand Pride”? The _Sun_ might condense A. T. Stewart’s purchase of two\r\ncity blocks into a paragraph, but there must be no short measure of\r\n“Gerald Vane’s Lost One,” by Walter Savage North.\r\n\r\nWhen the religious folk held the reins of the _Sun_ they tried to\r\ncompromise by printing “Great Expectations” as a serial, but the wise\r\nMr. Beach, on getting the paper back, quickly flung to his hungry\r\nreaders “Hunted Down,” by Ann S. Stephens. Later in the war he catered\r\nto the martial spirit with “Running the Blockade,” by Captain Wheeler,\r\nUnited States army.\r\n\r\nOne column of foreign news, one of city paragraphs, one of editorial\r\narticles, one of jokes and miscellany, one of fiction, and nineteen\r\nof advertising--that was about the make-up of Beach’s _Sun_ before\r\nthe Civil War; that was the prescription which enabled the _Sun_ to\r\nsell nearly sixty thousand copies in a city of eight hundred thousand\r\npeople. It was a fairly well condensed paper. In February, 1857, when\r\nit printed one day two and a half columns about the mysterious murder\r\nof Dr. Harvey Burdell, the rich dentist of Bond Street, it broke its\r\nrecord for length in a police story.\r\n\r\nIt was in Moses S. Beach’s time that the Atlantic cable, second only\r\nto the telegraph proper as an aid to newspapers, was laid. On August\r\n6, 1858, when Cyrus W. Field telegraphed to the Associated Press from\r\nNewfoundland that the ends of the cables had reached both shores of the\r\nsea, the _Sun_ said that it was “the greatest triumph of the age.”\r\nEleven days later the _Sun_ contained this article:\r\n\r\n    We received last night and publish to-day what purports to be\r\n    the message of Queen Victoria, congratulating the President of\r\n    the United States on the successful completion of the Atlantic\r\n    telegraph. We are assured that the message is genuine, and\r\n    that it came through the Atlantic cable. It is not surprising,\r\n    however, that the President, on receiving it, doubted its\r\n    genuineness, as among the hundreds who crowded our office last\r\n    evening the doubters largely preponderated.\r\n\r\n    The message, accepting it as the queen’s, is, in style and\r\n    tone, utterly unworthy of the great event which it was designed\r\n    to celebrate.\r\n\r\n    The message is so shabbily like royalty that we cannot believe\r\n    it to be a fabrication.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was written by John Vance, the Irish exile. And perhaps\r\nthe editorial article which appeared the following day was written by\r\nBeach himself:\r\n\r\n    Victoria’s message ... in its complete form, as it appears in\r\n    our columns to-day, is friendly and courteous, though rather\r\n    commonplace in expression and style.\r\n\r\nNew York had a great celebration over the laying of the cable that\r\nweek. The _Sun’s_ building bore a sign illuminated by gaslight:\r\n\r\n  S. F. B. MORSE AND CYRUS W. FIELD,\r\n  WIRE-PULLERS OF THE NINETEENTH\r\n  CENTURY.\r\n\r\nThe first piece of news to come by cable was printed in the _Sun_ of\r\nAugust 27, 1858, and ran:\r\n\r\n    A treaty of peace has been concluded with China, by which\r\n    England and France obtain all their demands, including the\r\n    establishment of embassies at Peking and indemnification for\r\n    the expenses of the war.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that this first cable was not a success, and\r\nthat permanent undersea telegraph service did not come until 1866; but\r\nthe results produced in 1858 convinced the world that Field and his\r\nassociates were right, and that perseverance and money would bring\r\nperfect results.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, when paper became cheaper, Beach preferred to enlarge\r\nthe _Sun_ rather than reduce its price to one cent. He never printed\r\nmore than four pages, but the lost columns were restored, with\r\ninterest, so that there were eight to a page. Even at two cents a copy\r\nit was still the cheapest of the morning papers; still the beloved of\r\nthe working classes and the desired of the politicians. Just after the\r\nwar ended the _Sun_ declared that it was read by half a million people.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 1868, when the _Sun_ had been in the possession of\r\nthe Beaches for about thirty of its thirty-five years, a new editor\r\nand manager, speaking for a new ownership of the _Sun_, made this\r\nannouncement at the head of the editorial column:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE SUN\r\n\r\n    THE OLDEST CHEAP PAPER IN NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n    Notice is hereby given that the _Sun_ newspaper, with its\r\n    presses, types, and fixtures, has become the property of an\r\n    association represented by the undersigned, and including\r\n    among its prominent stockholders Mr. M. S. Beach, recently the\r\n    exclusive owner of the whole property. It will henceforth be\r\n    published in the building known for the last half-century as\r\n    Tammany Hall, on the corner of Nassau and Frankfort Streets.\r\n    Its price will remain as heretofore at two cents a copy, or\r\n    six dollars per annum to mail subscribers. It will be printed\r\n    in handsome style on a folio sheet, as at present; but it will\r\n    contain more news and other reading matter than it has hitherto\r\n    given.\r\n\r\n    In changing its proprietorship, the _Sun_ will not in any\r\n    respect change its principles or general line of conduct. It\r\n    will continue to be an independent newspaper, wearing the\r\n    livery of no party, and discussing public questions and the\r\n    acts of public men on their merits alone. It will be guided, as\r\n    it has been hitherto, by uncompromising loyalty to the Union,\r\n    and will resist every attempt to weaken the bonds that unite\r\n    the American people into one nation.\r\n\r\n    The _Sun_ will support General Grant as its candidate for the\r\n    Presidency. It will advocate retrenchment and economy in the\r\n    public expenditures, and the reduction of the present crushing\r\n    burdens of taxation. It will advocate the speedy restoration of\r\n    the South, as needful to revive business and secure fair wages\r\n    for labor.\r\n\r\n    The _Sun_ will always have all the news, foreign, domestic,\r\n    political, social, literary, scientific, and commercial. It\r\n    will use enterprise and money freely to make the best possible\r\n    newspaper, as well as the cheapest.\r\n\r\n    It will study condensation, clearness, point, and will endeavor\r\n    to present its daily photograph of the whole world’s doings in\r\n    the most luminous and lively manner.\r\n\r\n    It will not take as long to read the _Sun_ as to read the\r\n    London _Times_ or Webster’s Dictionary, but when you have\r\n    read it you will know about all that has happened in both\r\n    hemispheres. The _Sun_ will also publish a semiweekly edition\r\n    at two dollars a year, containing the most interesting articles\r\n    from the daily, and also a condensed summary of the news\r\n    prepared expressly for this edition.\r\n\r\n    The _Weekly Sun_ will continue to be issued at one dollar\r\n    a year. It will be prepared with great care, and will also\r\n    contain all the news in a condensed and readable form. Both\r\n    the weekly and semiweekly will have accurate reports of the\r\n    general, household, and cattle markets. They will also have an\r\n    agricultural department, and will report the proceedings of\r\n    the Farmers’ Club. This department will be edited by Andrew\r\n    S. Fuller, Esq., whose name will guarantee the quality of his\r\n    contributions.\r\n\r\n    We shall endeavor to make the _Sun_ worthy the confidence of\r\n    the people in every part of the country. Its circulation is\r\n    now more than fifty thousand copies daily. We mean that it\r\n    shall soon be doubled; and in this, the aid of all persons who\r\n    want such a newspaper as we propose to make will be cordially\r\n    welcomed.\r\n\r\n                                        CHARLES A. DANA,\r\n                                          Editor and Manager.\r\n\r\n  New York, January 25, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath this announcement was a farewell message from Moses Sperry\r\nBeach to the readers whom he had served for twenty years:\r\n\r\n    With unreserved confidence in the ability of those who are to\r\n    continue this work of my life, I lay aside an armor which in\r\n    these latter years has been too loosely borne.\r\n\r\nSo Moses S. Beach retired from journalism at forty-five. With the\r\n$175,000 paid to him for the _Sun_, and the profits he had made in his\r\nmany years of ownership, he was easily rich enough to realize his dream\r\nof quiet rural life--a realization that lasted until his death in 1892.\r\n\r\nBut who was this Dana who was taking up at forty-eight the burden that\r\na younger man was almost wearily laying down?\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that he was not well known to the readers of the\r\n_Sun_. The newspaper world knew him as one who had been the backbone of\r\nGreeley’s _Tribune_ in the turbulent period before the Civil War and\r\nfor a year after the war was on. The army world knew him as the man who\r\nhad been chosen by Lincoln and Stanton for important and confidential\r\nmissions. Students knew him as one of the editors of the “New American\r\nEncyclopedia.” By many a fireside his name was familiar as the compiler\r\nof the “Household Book of Poetry.” Highbrows remembered him as one of\r\nthe group of geniuses in the Brook Farm colony.\r\n\r\nIn none of these categories were many of the men who ran with the\r\nfire-engines, voted for John Kelly, and bought the _Sun_. But the _Sun_\r\nwas the _Sun_; it was their paper, and they would have none other; and\r\nthey would see what this Dana would do with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE EARLIER CAREER OF DANA\r\n\r\n  _His Life at Brook Farm and His Tribune Experience.--His\r\n    Break with Greeley, His Civil War Services and His Chicago\r\n    Disappointment.--His Purchase of “The Sun.”_\r\n\r\n\r\nDay and Dana each did a great thing for the _Sun_ and incidentally\r\nfor journalism and for America. Day made humanity more intelligent by\r\nmaking newspapers popular. Dana made newspapers more intelligent by\r\nmaking them human.\r\n\r\nDay started the _Sun_ at twenty-three and left it at twenty-eight. Dana\r\ntook the _Sun_ at forty-eight and kept it for thirty years. Each, in\r\nhis time, was absolute master of the paper.\r\n\r\n“The great idea of Day’s time,” wrote E. P. Mitchell on the _Sun’s_\r\nfiftieth birthday, fifteen years after Dana took hold, “was cheapness\r\nto the buyer. The great idea of the _Sun_ as it is, was and is interest\r\nto the reader.”\r\n\r\nOf the nine men who have been owners of the _Sun_, seven were of\r\ndown-east Yankee stock, and six of the seven were born in New England.\r\nOf the editors-in-chief of the _Sun_--except in that brief period of\r\nthe lease by the religious coterie--all have been New Englanders but\r\none, and he was the son of a New Englander.\r\n\r\nDana was born in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, on August 8, 1819. His father\r\nwas Anderson Dana, sixth in descent from Richard Dana, the colonial\r\nsettler; and his mother, Ann Denison, came of straight Yankee stock.\r\nThe father failed in business at Hinsdale when Charles was a child,\r\nand the family moved to Gaines, a village in western New York, where\r\nAnderson Dana became a farmer. Here the mother died, leaving four\r\nchildren--Charles Anderson, aged nine; Junius, seven; Maria, three, and\r\nDavid, an infant. The widower went to the home of Mrs. Dana’s parents\r\nnear Guildhall, Vermont, and there the children were divided among\r\nrelatives. Charles was sent to live with his uncle, David Denison, on a\r\nfarm in the Connecticut River Valley.\r\n\r\nThere was a good teacher at the school near by, and at the age of ten\r\nCharles was considered as proficient in his English studies as many\r\nboys of fifteen. When he was twelve he had added some Latin to the\r\nthree R’s. In the judgment of that day he was fit to go to work. His\r\nuncle, William Dana, was part owner of the general store of Staats &\r\nDana, in Buffalo, New York, whither the boy was sent by stage-coach. He\r\nmade himself handy in the store and lived at his uncle’s house.\r\n\r\nBuffalo, a distributing place for freight sent West on the Erie Canal,\r\nhad a population of only fifteen thousand in 1831. Many of Staats &\r\nDana’s customers were Indians, and young Charles added to the store’s\r\nefficiency by learning the Seneca language. At night he continued his\r\npursuit of Latin, tackled Greek, read what volumes of Tom Paine he\r\ncould buy at a book-shop next door, and followed the career, military\r\nand political, of the strenuous Andrew Jackson. When he had a day off\r\nhe went fishing in the Niagara River or visited the Indian reservation.\r\n\r\nHe was a normal, healthy lad, even if he knew more Latin than he\r\nshould. When war threatened with Great Britain over the Caroline\r\naffair, Dana joined the City Guard and had a brief ambition to be a\r\nsoldier. He was of slender build, but strong. He belonged to the\r\nCoffee Club, a literary organization, and he made a talk to it on early\r\nEnglish poetry.\r\n\r\n“The best days of my life,” he called this period.\r\n\r\nStaats & Dana failed in the panic of 1837, and Charles, then eighteen,\r\nand the possessor of two hundred dollars saved from his wages, decided\r\nto go to Harvard. He left Buffalo in June, 1839, although his father\r\ndid not like the idea of letting him go to Harvard.\r\n\r\n“I know it ranks high as a literary institution, but the influence\r\nit exerts in a religious way is most horrible--even worse than\r\nUniversalism.”\r\n\r\nAnderson Dana had a horror of Unitarianism, and had heard that Charles\r\nwas attending Unitarian meetings.\r\n\r\n“Ponder well the paths of thy feet,” he wrote in solemn warning to his\r\nperilously venturesome son, “lest they lead down to the very gates of\r\nhell.”\r\n\r\nDana entered college without difficulty, and devoted much of his time\r\nto philosophy and general literature. He wrote to his friend, Dr.\r\nAustin Flint, whom he had met in Buffalo, and who had advised him to go\r\nto Harvard.\r\n\r\n    I am in the focus of what Professor Felton calls\r\n    “supersublimated transcendentalism,” and to tell the truth,\r\n    I take to it rather kindly, though I stumble sadly at some\r\n    notions.\r\n\r\nThis was not strange, for besides hearing Unitarian discourse, young\r\nDana was attending Emerson’s lectures at Harvard and reading Carlyle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHARLES A. DANA AT THIRTY-EIGHT\r\n    A Photograph Taken in 1857 When He Was Managing Editor of the\r\n    New York “Tribune.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn his first term Dana stood seventh in a class of seventy-four. In the\r\nspring of 1840 he left Cambridge, but pursued the university studies at\r\nthe home of his uncle in Guildhall, Vermont. Here, at an expense of\r\nabout a dollar a week, he put in eight hours a day at his books, and\r\nfor diversion went shooting or tinkered in the farm shop. His sister,\r\nthen fifteen years old, was there, and he helped her with her studies.\r\n\r\nDana returned to Harvard in the autumn, but not for long. His purse was\r\nabout empty, and he found no means of replenishing it at Cambridge.\r\nIn November the faculty gave him permission to be absent during the\r\nwinter to “keep school.” Dana went to teach at Scituate, Massachusetts,\r\ngetting twenty-five dollars a month and his board.\r\n\r\nHis regret at leaving college was keen, for it meant that he would miss\r\nRichard Henry Dana’s lectures on poetry, and George Ripley’s on foreign\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nYoung Dana’s mind was full in those days. There was the eager desire\r\nfor education, with poverty in the path. He thought he saw a way around\r\nby going to Germany, where he could live cheaply at a university and be\r\npaid for teaching English. There was also a religious struggle.\r\n\r\n    I feel now an inclination to orthodoxy, and am trying to\r\n    believe the real doctrine of the Trinity. Whether I shall\r\n    settle down in Episcopacy, Swedenborgianism, or Goethean\r\n    indifference to all religion, I know not. My only prayer is,\r\n    “God help me!”\r\n\r\nBut the immediate reality was teaching school in a little town where\r\nmost of the pupils were unruly sailors, and Dana faced it with\r\ngood-natured philosophy. At the end of a day’s struggle to train some\r\nsixty or seventy Scituate youths, he went back to the home of Captain\r\nWebb, with whose family he boarded, and read Coleridge for literary\r\nquality, Swedenborg for religion, and “Oliver Twist” for diversion.\r\nCandles and whale-oil lamps were the only illuminants, and Dana’s\r\neyes, never too strong, began to weaken.\r\n\r\nHe returned to college in the spring of 1841, but his eyes would stand\r\nno more. He was about to find work as an agricultural labourer when\r\nBrook Farm attracted him. Through George Ripley he was admitted to\r\nthat association, which sought to combine labour and intellect in a\r\nbeautiful communistic scheme. He agreed to teach Greek and German and\r\nto help with the farm work.\r\n\r\nDana subscribed for three of the thirty shares--at five hundred dollars\r\na share--of the stock of the Brook Farm Institute of Agriculture and\r\nEducation, as the company was legally titled. Brook Farm was a fine\r\nplace of a hundred and ninety-two acres, in the town of Roxbury,\r\nabout nine miles from Boston. It cost $10,500 and, as most of the\r\nshareholders had no money to pay on their stock, mortgages amounting\r\nto eleven thousand dollars were immediately clapped on the place--a\r\nfeat rare in the business world, at once to mortgage a place for more\r\nthan its cost. Dana, now twenty-three years old, was elected recording\r\nsecretary, one of the three trustees, and a member of the committees on\r\nfinance and education.\r\n\r\nHe remained as a Brook Farmer to the end of the five years that the\r\nexperiment lasted. There he met Hawthorne, who lingered long enough to\r\nget much of the material for his “Blithedale Romance”; Thoreau, who\r\nhad not yet gone to Walden Pond; William Ellery Channing, second, the\r\nauthor and journalist; Albert Brisbane, the most radical of the group\r\nof socialists of his day; and Margaret Fuller, who believed in Brook\r\nFarm, but did not live there.\r\n\r\nBrook Farm was the perfect democracy. The members did all the work,\r\nmenial and otherwise, and if there was honour it fell to him whose\r\ntask was humblest. The community paid each worker a dollar a day, and\r\ncharged him or her about two dollars and fifty cents a week for board.\r\nIt sold its surplus produce, and it educated children at low rates.\r\nGeorge Ripley, the Unitarian minister, was chief of the cow-milking\r\ngroup, and Dana helped him. Dana, as head waiter, served food to John\r\nCheever, valet to an English baronet then staying in Boston.\r\n\r\n“And it was great fun,” Dana said, in a lecture delivered at the\r\nUniversity of Michigan forty years afterward. “There were seventy\r\npeople or more, and at dinner they all came in and we served them.\r\nThere was more entertainment in doing the duty than in getting away\r\nfrom it.”\r\n\r\nIt was at Brook Farm that Dana first made the acquaintance of Horace\r\nGreeley, who, himself a student of Fourier, was interested in the\r\nRoxbury experiment, so much more idealistic than Fourierism itself.\r\n\r\nDana took Brook Farm seriously, but he was not one of the poseurs\r\nof the colony. No smocks for him, no long hair! He wore a full,\r\nauburn beard, but he wore a beard all the rest of his life. He was a\r\nhandsome, slender youth, and he got mental and physical health out of\r\nevery minute at the farm. By day he was busy teaching, keeping the\r\nassociation’s books, milking, waiting on table, or caring for the\r\nfruit-trees. He was the most useful man on the farm. At night, when the\r\nothers danced, he was at his books or his writings.\r\n\r\nHe wrote articles for the _Harbinger_, and for the _Dial_,\r\nwhich succeeded the _Harbinger_ as the official organ of the\r\nTranscendentalists. Dr. Ripley was the editor of the _Harbinger_, and\r\nhe had such brilliant contributors as James Russell Lowell and George\r\nWilliam Curtis; but Dana was his mainstay. He wrote book-reviews,\r\neditorial articles and notes, and not a little verse. His “Via Sacra”\r\nis typical of the thoughtful youth:\r\n\r\n  Slowly along the crowded street I go,\r\n    Marking with reverent look each passer’s face,\r\n    Seeking, and not in vain, in each to trace\r\n  That primal soul whereof he is the show.\r\n    For here still move, by many eyes unseen,\r\n  The blessed gods that erst Olympus kept;\r\n    Through every guise these lofty forms serene\r\n  Declare the all-holding life hath never slept;\r\n    But known each thrill that in man’s heart hath been,\r\n  And every tear that his sad eyes have wept.\r\n    Alas for us! The heavenly visitants--\r\n  We greet them still as most unwelcome guests,\r\n    Answering their smile with hateful looks askance,\r\n  Their sacred speech with foolish, bitter jests;\r\n    But oh, what is it to imperial Jove\r\n    That this poor world refuses all his love?\r\n\r\nA Mrs. Macdaniel, a widow, came to Brook Farm from Maryland with\r\nher son and two daughters. One of the daughters brought with her\r\nan ambition for the stage, but her destiny was to be Mrs. Dana. On\r\nMarch 2, 1846, in New York, Charles A. Dana and Eunice Macdaniel were\r\nmarried. That day, coincidentally, the fire insurance on the main\r\nbuilding at Brook Farm lapsed, perhaps through the preoccupation of\r\nthe recording secretary; and the next day this building, called the\r\nPhalanstery, was burned.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of the end of Brook Farm and of Dana’s secluded\r\nlife. He went to work on the Boston _Daily Chronotype_ for five dollars\r\na week. It was a Congregational paper, owned and edited by Elizur\r\nWright. When Wright was absent, Dana acted as editor, and on one of\r\nthese occasions he caused the _Chronotype_ to come out so “mighty\r\nstrong against hell,” that Mr. Wright declared, years afterward, that\r\nhe had to write a personal letter to every Congregational minister\r\nin Massachusetts, explaining that the apparent heresy was due to\r\nhis having left the paper in the charge of “a young man without\r\njournalistic experience.”\r\n\r\nIn February, 1847, Dana went to New York, and Horace Greeley made him\r\ncity editor of the _Tribune_ at ten dollars a week. Later in that year\r\nDana insisted on an increase of salary, and Greeley agreed to pay him\r\nfourteen dollars a week--a dollar less than his own stipend; but in\r\nconsideration of this huge advance Dana was obliged to give all his\r\ntalents to the _Tribune_.\r\n\r\nDana still nursed his desire to see Europe, but he had given up the\r\nidea of teaching in a German university. Newspaper work had captured\r\nhim. Germany was still attractive, but now as a place of news, for the\r\nrumblings against the rule of Metternich were being heard in central\r\nEurope. And in France there was a sweep of socialism, a subject which\r\nstill held the idealistic Dana, and the beginning of the revolution in\r\nParis (February 24, 1848).\r\n\r\nDana told Greeley of his European ambition, but Greeley threw cold\r\nwater on it, saying that Dana--not yet thirty--knew nothing about\r\nforeign politics. Dana asked how much the _Tribune_ would pay for a\r\nletter a week if he went abroad “on his own,” and Greeley offered ten\r\ndollars, which Dana accepted. He made a similar agreement with the New\r\nYork _Commercial Advertiser_ and the Philadelphia _North American_, and\r\ncontracted to send letters to the _Harbinger_ and the _Chronotype_ for\r\nfive dollars a week.\r\n\r\n“That gave me forty dollars a week for five letters,” said Dana\r\nafterward; “and when the _Chronotype_ went up, I still had thirty-five\r\ndollars. On this I lived in Europe nearly eight months, saw plenty of\r\nrevolutions, supported myself there and my family in New York, and\r\ncame home only sixty-three dollars out for the whole trip.” Not a bad\r\noutcome for what was probably the first correspondence syndicate ever\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nThe trip did wonders for Dana. He saw the foreign “improvers of\r\nmankind” in action, more violent than visionary; saw theory dashed\r\nagainst the rocks of reality. He came back a wiser and better\r\nnewspaperman, with a knowledge of European conditions and men that\r\nserved him well all his life. There is seen in some of his descriptions\r\nthe fine simplicity of style that was later to make the _Sun_ the most\r\nhuman newspaper.\r\n\r\nSocial experiments still interested Dana after his return to New York\r\nin the spring of 1849, but he was able to take a clearer view of their\r\npracticability than he had been in the Brook Farm days. He still\r\nfavoured association and cooperation, and every sane effort toward the\r\namelioration of human misery, but he now knew that there was no direct\r\nroad to the millennium.\r\n\r\nOnce home, however, and settled, not only as managing editor, but as\r\na holder of five shares of stock in the _Tribune_, Dana was kept busy\r\nwith things other than socialistic theories. Slavery and the tariff\r\nwere the overshadowing issues of the day.\r\n\r\nGreeley was the great man of the _Tribune_ office, but Dana, in the\r\npresent-day language of Park Row, was the live wire almost from the day\r\nof his return from Europe. When Greeley went abroad, Dana took charge.\r\nGreeley now drew fifty dollars a week; Dana got twenty-five, Bayard\r\nTaylor twenty, George Ripley fifteen. Dana’s five shares of stock\r\nnetted him about two thousand dollars a year in addition to his salary.\r\n\r\nHere is a part of a letter which Dana wrote in 1852 to James S. Pike,\r\nthe Washington correspondent of the _Tribune_:\r\n\r\n    KEENEST OF PIKES:\r\n\r\n    What a desert void of news you keep at Washington! For\r\n    goodness’ sake, kick up a row of some sort. Fight a duel,\r\n    defraud the Treasury, set fire to the fueling-mill, get Black\r\n    Dan [Webster] drunk, or commit some other excess that will make\r\n    a stir.\r\n\r\nThe solemn phrases of transcendentalism had vanished from the tip of\r\nDana’s pen.\r\n\r\nIn the fight over slavery in the fifties, the effort of Greeley\r\nand Dana was against the further spread of the institution over\r\nnew American territory, rather than for its complete overthrow.\r\nWhen Greeley was at the helm, the _Tribune_ appeared to admit the\r\npossibility of secession, a forerunner of “Let the erring sisters\r\ndepart in peace.” But when Dana was left in charge, the editorials\r\npleaded for the integrity of the Union at any cost. Greeley was heart\r\nand soul for liberty, but his fist was not in the fight. Of the\r\npolitical situation in 1854, Henry Wilson wrote, in his “Rise and Fall\r\nof the Slave Power”:\r\n\r\n    At the outset Mr. Greeley was hopeless, and seemed disinclined\r\n    to enter the contest. He told his associates that he would\r\n    not restrain them; but, as for himself, he had no heart for\r\n    the strife. They were more hopeful; and Richard Hildreth, the\r\n    historian; Charles A. Dana, the veteran journalist; James S.\r\n    Pike, and other able writers, opened and continued a powerful\r\n    opposition in its columns, and did very much to rally and\r\n    assure the friends of freedom and nerve them for the fight.\r\n\r\nDana went farther than Greeley cared to go, particularly in his attacks\r\non the Democrats; so far, in fact, that Greeley often pleaded with him\r\nto stop. Greeley wrote to James S. Pike:\r\n\r\n    Charge Dana not to slaughter anybody, but be mild and\r\n    meek-souled like me.\r\n\r\nGreeley wrote to Dana from Washington, where Dana’s radicalism was\r\nmaking his colleague uncomfortable:\r\n\r\n    Now I write once more to entreat that I may be allowed to\r\n    conduct the _Tribune_ with reference to the mile wide that\r\n    stretches either way from Pennsylvania Avenue. It is but a\r\n    small space, and you have all the world besides. I cannot stay\r\n    here unless this request is complied with. I would rather cease\r\n    to live at all.\r\n\r\n    If you are not willing to leave me entire control with\r\n    reference to this city, I ask you to call the proprietors\r\n    together and have me discharged. I have to go to this and that\r\n    false creature--Lew Campbell, for instance--yet in constant\r\n    terror of seeing him guillotined in the next _Tribune_ that\r\n    arrives, and I can’t make him believe that I didn’t instigate\r\n    it. So with everything here. If you want to throw stones at\r\n    anybody’s crockery, aim at my head first, and in mercy be sure\r\n    to aim well.\r\n\r\nAgain Greeley wrote to Dana:\r\n\r\n    You are getting everybody to curse me. I am too sick to be out\r\n    of bed, too crazy to sleep, and am surrounded by horrors.... I\r\n    can bear the responsibilities that belong to me, but you heap a\r\n    load on me that will kill me.\r\n\r\nWith all Dana’s editorial work--and he and Greeley made the _Tribune_\r\nthe most powerful paper of the fifties, with a million readers--he\r\nfound time for the purely literary. He translated and published a\r\nvolume of German stories and legends under the title “The Black Ant.”\r\nHe edited a book of views of remarkable places and objects in all\r\ncountries. In 1857 was published his “Household Book of Poetry,” still\r\na standard work of reference. He was criticised for omitting Poe from\r\nthe first edition, and at the next printing he added “The Raven,” “The\r\nBells,” and “Annabel Lee.” Poe and Cooper were among the literary gods\r\nwhom Dana refused to worship in his youth, but in later life he changed\r\nhis opinion of the poet.\r\n\r\nWith George Ripley, his friend in Harvard, at Brook Farm, and in the\r\n_Tribune_ office, Dana prepared the “New American Encyclopedia,” which\r\nwas published between 1858 and 1863. It was a huge undertaking and a\r\nsuccess. Dana and Ripley carefully revised it ten years afterward. In\r\n1882, with Rossiter Johnson, Dana edited and published a collection of\r\nverse under the title “Fifty Perfect Poems.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Dana persisted that the Union must not fall, Greeley still\r\nbelieved, as late as December, 1860, that it would “not be found\r\npractical to coerce” the threatening States into subjection. When war\r\nactually came, however, Greeley at last adopted the policy of “No\r\ncompromise, no concessions to traitors.”\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune’s_ cry, “Forward to Richmond!” sounded from May, 1861,\r\nuntil Bull Run, was generally attributed to Dana. Greeley himself made\r\nit plain that it was not his:\r\n\r\n    I wish to be distinctly understood as not seeking to be\r\n    relieved from any responsibility for urging the advance of the\r\n    Union army in Virginia, though the precise phrase, “Forward\r\n    to Richmond!” was not mine, and I would have preferred not to\r\n    reiterate it. Henceforth I bar all criticism in these columns\r\n    on army movements. Now let the wolves howl on! I do not believe\r\n    they can goad me into another personal letter.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, “Forward to Richmond!” was phrased by Fitz-Henry\r\nWarren, then head of the _Tribune’s_ correspondence staff in\r\nWashington. He came from Iowa, where in his youth he was editor of the\r\nBurlington _Hawkeye_. He resigned from the _Tribune_ late in 1861 to\r\ntake command of the First Iowa Cavalry, which he organized. In 1862 he\r\nbecame a brigadier-general, and he was later brevetted a major-general.\r\nIn 1869 he was the American minister to Guatemala. From being one of\r\nthe men around Greeley he became one of the men with Dana, and in\r\n1875–1876 he did Washington correspondence for the _Sun_, and wrote\r\nmany editorial articles for it.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 Dana was an active advocate of Greeley’s candidacy for the\r\nUnited States Senate, and almost got him nominated. If Greeley had\r\ngone to the Senate, Dana might have continued on the _Tribune_; but\r\nit became evident, before the war was a year old, that one newspaper\r\nwas no longer large enough for both men. The sprightly, aggressive,\r\nunhesitating, and practical Dana, and the ambitious, but eccentric\r\nand somewhat visionary Greeley found their paths diverging. The\r\ncircumstances under which they parted were thus described by Dana in a\r\nletter to a friend:\r\n\r\n    On Thursday, March 27, I was notified that Mr. Greeley had\r\n    given the stockholders notice that I must leave, or he would,\r\n    and that they wanted me to leave accordingly. No cause of\r\n    dissatisfaction being alleged, and H. G. having been of late\r\n    more confidential and friendly than ever, not once having said\r\n    anything betokening disaffection to me, I sent a friend to him\r\n    to ascertain if it was true, or if some misunderstanding was at\r\n    the bottom of it. My friend came and reported that it was true,\r\n    and that H. G. was immovable.\r\n\r\n    On Friday, March 28, I resigned, and the trustees at once\r\n    accepted it, passing highly complimentary resolutions and\r\n    voting me six months’ salary after the date of my resignation.\r\n    Mr. Ripley opposed the proceedings in the trustees, and,\r\n    above all, insisted on delay in order that the facts might be\r\n    ascertained; but all in vain.\r\n\r\n    On Saturday, March 29, Mr. Greeley came down, called another\r\n    meeting of the trustees, said he had never desired me to\r\n    leave, that it was a damned lie that he had presented such an\r\n    alternative as that he or I must go, and finally sent me a\r\n    verbal message desiring me to remain as a writer of editorials;\r\n    but has never been near me since to meet the “damned lie”\r\n    in person, nor written one word on the subject. I conclude,\r\n    accordingly, that he is glad to have me out, and that he really\r\n    set on foot the secret cabal by which it was accomplished. As\r\n    soon as I get my pay for my shares--ten thousand dollars less\r\n    than I could have got for them a year ago--I shall be content.\r\n\r\nThat was the undramatic and somewhat disappointing end of Dana’s\r\nfourteen years on the _Tribune_. He was forty-three years old and not\r\nrich. All he had was what he got from the sale of his _Tribune_ stock\r\nand what he had saved from the royalties on his books.\r\n\r\nFrom the literary view-point he was doubtless the best-equipped\r\nnewspaperman in America, but there was no great place open for him then.\r\n\r\nDana’s work on the _Tribune_ had attracted the attention of most of\r\nthe big men of the North, including Edwin M. Stanton, who in January,\r\n1862, was appointed Secretary of War in place of Simon Cameron. Stanton\r\nasked Dana to come into the War Department, and assigned him to service\r\nupon a commission to audit unsettled claims against the quartermaster’s\r\ndepartment. While in Memphis on this work he first met General Grant,\r\nthen prosecuting the war in the West.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1862, Stanton offered to Dana a post as second\r\nAssistant Secretary of War, and Dana, having accepted, told a\r\nnewspaperman of his appointment. When the news was printed, the\r\nirascible Stanton was so much annoyed--although without any apparent\r\nreason--that he withdrew the appointment. Dana then became a partner\r\nwith George W. Chadwick, of New York, and Roscoe Conkling, of Utica, in\r\nan enterprise for buying cotton in that part of the Mississippi Valley\r\nwhich the Union army occupied.\r\n\r\nDana and Chadwick went to Memphis in January, 1863, armed with letters\r\nfrom Secretary Stanton to General Grant and other field commanders.\r\nBut no sooner had their cotton operations begun than Dana saw the\r\nevil effect that this traffic was having. It had aroused a fever of\r\nspeculation. Army officers were forming partnerships with cotton\r\noperators, and even privates wanted to buy cotton with their pay. The\r\nConfederacy was being helped rather than hindered.\r\n\r\nDisregarding his own fortunes, Dana called upon General Grant and\r\nadvised him to “put an end to an evil so enormous, so insidious and so\r\nfull of peril to the country.” Grant at once issued an order designed\r\nto end the traffic, but the cotton-traders succeeded in having it\r\nnullified by the government.\r\n\r\nThen Dana went to Washington, saw President Lincoln and Secretary\r\nStanton, and convinced them that the cotton trade should be handled by\r\nthe Treasury Department. As a result of Dana’s visit, Lincoln issued\r\nhis proclamation declaring all commercial intercourse with seceded\r\nStates to be unlawful. Thus Dana patriotically worked himself out of a\r\npaying business.\r\n\r\nYet his unselfishness was not without a reward. It reestablished his\r\nfriendly relations with Stanton, and won for him the President’s\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nJust then there was an important errand to be done. Many complaints\r\nhad been made against General Grant. Certain temperance people had\r\ntold Lincoln that Grant was drinking heavily, and although Lincoln\r\njested--“Can you tell me where Grant buys his liquor? I would\r\nlike to distribute a few barrels of the same brand among my other\r\nmajor-generals”--he really wished to have all doubts settled.\r\n\r\nThe President and Mr. Stanton chose Dana for the mission. It was an\r\nopen secret. If Grant did not know that Dana was coming to make a\r\nreport on his conduct, all the general’s staff knew it. General James\r\nHarrison Wilson, biographer of Dana--and, with Dana, biographer of\r\nGrant--wrote of this situation:\r\n\r\n    It was believed by many that if he [Dana] did not bring plenary\r\n    authority to actually displace Grant, the fate of that general\r\n    would certainly depend upon the character of the reports which\r\n    the special commissioner might send to Washington in regard to\r\n    him.\r\n\r\nWilson was at this time the inspector-general of Grant’s army. He\r\nconsulted with John A. Rawlins, Grant’s austere young adjutant-general\r\nand actual chief of staff, and the two officers agreed that Dana must\r\nbe taken into complete confidence. Wilson wrote:\r\n\r\n    We sincerely believed that Grant, whatever might be his faults\r\n    and weaknesses, was a far safer man to command the army than\r\n    any other general in it, or than any that might be sent to it\r\n    from another field.\r\n\r\nDana and Wilson and Rawlins made the best of a delicate, difficult\r\nsituation. Dana was taken into headquarters “on the footing of an\r\nofficer of the highest rank.” His commission was that of a major of\r\nvolunteers, but his functions were so important that he was called “Mr.\r\nDana” rather than “Major Dana.” Dana himself never used the military\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\nDana sent his first official despatches to Stanton in March, 1863,\r\nfrom before Vicksburg. Grant’s staff made clear to him the plan of the\r\nturning movement by which the gunboats and transports were to be run\r\npast the Vicksburg batteries while the army marched across the country,\r\nand Dana made most favourable reports to Washington on the general’s\r\nstrategy.\r\n\r\nDana saw not only real warfare, but a country that was new to him.\r\nAfter a trip into Louisiana he wrote to his friend, William Henry\r\nHuntington:\r\n\r\n    During the eight days that I have been here, I have got new\r\n    insight into slavery, which has made me no more a friend of\r\n    that institution than I was before.... It was not till I saw\r\n    these plantations, with their apparatus for living and working,\r\n    that I really felt the aristocratic nature of it.\r\n\r\nUnder a flag of truce Dana went close to Vicksburg, where he was met by\r\na Confederate major of artillery:\r\n\r\n    Our people entertained him with a cigar and a drink of whisky,\r\n    of course, or, rather, with two drinks. This is an awful\r\n    country for drinking whisky. I calculate that on an average a\r\n    friendly man will drink a gallon in twenty-four hours. I wish\r\n    you were here to do my drinking for me, for I suffer in public\r\n    estimation for not doing as the Romans do.\r\n\r\nDana was with Grant on the memorable night of April 16, 1863, when the\r\nsquadron of gunboats, barges, and transports ran the Vicksburg forts.\r\nFrom that time on until July he accompanied the great soldier. It was\r\nDana who received and communicated Stanton’s despatch giving to Grant\r\n“full and absolute authority to enforce his own commands, and to remove\r\nany person who, by ignorance, inaction, or any cause, interferes with\r\nor delays his operations.”\r\n\r\nDana was in many marches and battles. Like the officers of Grant’s\r\nstaff, he slept in farmhouses, and ate pork and hardtack or what the\r\nland provided. The move on Vicksburg was a brilliant campaign, and\r\nin ten days Dana saw as much of war as most men of the Civil War saw\r\nin three years. Dana sent despatches to Washington describing the\r\nbattles at Champion’s Hill and the Big Black Bridge, the investment of\r\nVicksburg, and the establishment of a line of supply from the North.\r\nThrough Dana’s eyes the government began to see Grant as he really was.\r\n\r\nDana, with either Grant or Wilson, rode over all the country of the\r\nVicksburg campaign, often under fire. He was present at Grant’s\r\ncouncils, and rode into Vicksburg with him after its surrender. Dana’s\r\nview of the great soldier’s personality is given in something he wrote\r\nmany years later, long after their friendship was ended:\r\n\r\n    Grant was an uncommon fellow--the most modest, the most\r\n    disinterested, and the most honest man I ever knew, with a\r\n    temper that nothing could disturb, and a judgment that was\r\n    judicial in its comprehensiveness and wisdom. Not a great\r\n    man, except morally; nor an original or brilliant man, but\r\n    sincere, thoughtful, deep, and gifted with courage that never\r\n    faltered. When the time came to risk all, he went in like a\r\n    simple-hearted, unaffecting, unpretending hero, whom no ill\r\n    omens could deject and no triumph unduly exalt. A social,\r\n    friendly man, too; fond of a pleasant joke and also ready\r\n    with one; but liking above all a long chat of an evening,\r\n    and ready to sit up with you all night talking in the cool\r\n    breeze in front of his tent. Not a man of sentimentality, not\r\n    demonstrative in friendship; but always holding to his friends\r\n    and just even to the enemies he hated.\r\n\r\nHere is Dana’s picture of Rawlins, sent to Stanton on July 12,\r\n1863--eight days after the fall of Vicksburg:\r\n\r\n    He is a lawyer by profession, a townsman of Grant, and has\r\n    great influence over him, especially because he watches him\r\n    day and night, and whenever he commits the folly of tasting\r\n    liquor, hastens to remind him that at the beginning of the war\r\n    he gave him [Rawlins] his word of honor not to touch a drop as\r\n    long as it lasted. Grant thinks Rawlins a first-rate adjutant,\r\n    but I think this is a mistake. He is too slow, and can’t write\r\n    the English language correctly without a great deal of careful\r\n    consideration.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this criticism, Dana admired Rawlins. Without him, he said,\r\nGrant would not have been the same man.\r\n\r\nAfter Vicksburg and Gettysburg, Dana returned to Washington. He was now\r\nan Assistant Secretary of War, and his success as an official reporter\r\non the conduct of the Army of the Tennessee had been so great that\r\nStanton sent him to cover, in the same way, the operations of the Army\r\nof the Cumberland, going first to General Rosecrans at Chattanooga.\r\nDana saw the hottest of the great fight at Chickamauga, and galloped\r\ntwelve miles to send his despatches about it to Stanton. He made blunt\r\nreports to the government on the unfitness of Rosecrans:\r\n\r\n    I consider this army to be very unsafe in his hands, but I know\r\n    of no one except Thomas who could now be safely put in his\r\n    place.\r\n\r\nAfter a conference at Louisville between Stanton and Grant, Rosecrans\r\nwas relieved and Thomas became commander of the Army of the Cumberland.\r\nA fine soldier and a modest man, Thomas was disinclined to supplant a\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n“You have got me this time,” he said to Dana, “but there is nothing\r\nfor a man to do in such a case but obey orders.”\r\n\r\nDana’s despatches had made Stanton realize the importance of holding\r\nChattanooga, and the Secretary of War ordered Thomas to defend it at\r\nall hazards.\r\n\r\n“I will hold the town till we starve!” replied Thomas.\r\n\r\nDana was not only a useful eye for the government, but he was a valued\r\ncompanion for General Wilson and other officers who went with him on\r\nhis missions. He knew more poetry than any other man in the army except\r\nGeneral Michael Lawler, an Illinois farmer, whose boast it was that on\r\nhearing any line of standard English verse he could repeat the next\r\nline. Dana, the compiler of the “Household Book of Poetry,” would try\r\nto catch Lawler, but in vain. Dana was not so literal as the Illinois\r\ngeneral, but General Wilson says that he “seemed never to forget\r\nanything he had ever read.”\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of Dana’s despatches to Stanton was that they gave\r\na picture of the doings in his field of work that was not biased by\r\nmilitary pride or ambition. He wrote what he saw and knew, without\r\ncounting the effect on the generals concerned. For one illuminating\r\nexample, there was his story of the final attack in the battle of\r\nMissionary Ridge. To read Grant or Sherman, one would suppose that the\r\ntriumphant assault was planned precisely as it was executed; but Dana’s\r\naccount of that fierce day is the one that must be relied upon:\r\n\r\n    The storming of the ridge by our troops was one of the greatest\r\n    miracles in military history. No man that climbs the ascent by\r\n    any of the roads that wind along its front could believe that\r\n    eighteen thousand men were moved up its broken and crumbling\r\n    face, unless it was his fortune to witness the deed. It seems\r\n    as awful as the visible interposition of God. Neither Grant nor\r\n    Thomas intended it. Their orders were to carry the rifle-pits\r\n    along the base of the ridge and capture their occupants; but\r\n    when this was accomplished, the unaccountable spirit of the\r\n    troops bore them bodily up those impracticable steeps, over\r\n    bristling rifle-pits on the crest, and thirty cannon enfilading\r\n    every gully. The order to storm appears to have been given\r\n    simultaneously by Generals Sheridan and Wood, because the men\r\n    were not to be held back, dangerous as the attempt appeared\r\n    to military prudence. Besides, the generals had caught the\r\n    inspiration of the men, and were ready themselves to undertake\r\n    impossibilities.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that even when Lincoln was confined to his chamber by\r\nillness, Dana’s despatches were brought to him; “not merely because\r\nthey are reliable,” as Assistant Secretary of War Watson wrote to Dana,\r\n“but for their clearness of narrative and their graphic pictures of\r\nthe stirring events they describe.” A conservative tribute to the best\r\nreporter of the Civil War.\r\n\r\nDana returned to Washington about the beginning of 1864 to take up\r\noffice tasks, and particularly the reorganization of the Cavalry\r\nBureau. Dishonest horse-dealers were plundering the government, and\r\nDana never rested until he had sent enough of these rogues to prison to\r\nfrighten the rest of the band. Dana was a good office man; he worked,\r\nsays James Harrison Wilson, “like a skilful bricklayer.” And as he\r\nrelieved Stanton of much of the routine of the War Department, the\r\nSecretary supported him in his assaults on dishonest contractors, even\r\nwhen the political pressure brought to bear for their protection was at\r\nits highest.\r\n\r\nLincoln sent Dana to report Grant’s progress in the Virginia campaign\r\nthat opened in May, 1864. On the 26th, three weeks after the march\r\nbegan, he was able to notify Washington of an entire change in the\r\nmorale of the contending armies:\r\n\r\n    The rebels have lost all confidence, and are already morally\r\n    defeated. This army has learned to believe that it is sure of\r\n    victory. Even our officers have ceased to regard Lee as an\r\n    invincible military genius.... Rely upon it, the end is near as\r\n    well as sure.\r\n\r\nIn the eventful weeks of that early summer Dana became an observer for\r\nGrant as well as for the government. It was evident to Dana that the\r\ngreat soldier, and not Washington, must decide what was to be done. In\r\na despatch from Washington, whither he had returned at Grant’s request,\r\nDana said to the general:\r\n\r\n    Until you direct positively and explicitly what is to be done,\r\n    everything will go on in the fatal way in which it has gone on\r\n    for the past week.\r\n\r\nLongstreet’s Confederates were coming down the Shenandoah Valley,\r\nand Grant, taking heed of Dana’s significant message, sent Sheridan\r\nto dispose of them. Then, as Grant himself was stationed in front of\r\nPetersburg, Dana resumed his activities in the office at Washington.\r\n\r\n“It has fallen to the lot of no other American,” says General Wilson,\r\n“to serve as the confidential medium of communication between the army\r\nand the government and between the government and the general-in-chief,\r\nas it did to Dana during the War of the Rebellion.”\r\n\r\nOne pleasant errand which fell to Dana was the delivery to Sheridan,\r\nafter his victory over Early at Cedar Creek, of his promotion to\r\nmajor-general. This entailed a journey on horseback through the Valley\r\nof Virginia, and the constant danger of capture by Mosby’s guerrillas;\r\nbut Dana, who greatly admired Sheridan, was glad to take the chance.\r\n\r\nWhen the news came to Washington of the fall of Richmond, in April,\r\n1865, Secretary Stanton sent Dana to the Confederate capital to gather\r\nup its archives. Many of these historically valuable papers had been\r\nremoved and scattered, but Dana collected what he could and sent them\r\nto Washington. He wanted to be present with Grant at Lee’s surrender,\r\nbut fate kept him in Richmond, for Lincoln was there, and needed him.\r\nWhen at last he got away, Grant had left Appomattox. Dana joined him\r\n_en route_, and together they reached Washington on the day before the\r\nPresident’s assassination.\r\n\r\nIt was on the day of his arrival that Dana went to the President to ask\r\nhim whether it would be well to order the arrest of Jacob Thompson, a\r\nConfederate commissioner who was trying to go from Canada to Europe\r\nthrough Maine. Lincoln returned the historic reply:\r\n\r\n    “No, I rather think not. When you have got an elephant by the\r\n    hind leg, and he is trying to run away, it’s best to let him\r\n    run!”\r\n\r\nA few hours after the President’s death, however, Stanton ordered Dana\r\nto obtain Thompson’s arrest.\r\n\r\nDana was active in unearthing the conspiracy that led to the\r\nassassination. A month later, acting under Stanton’s injunctions,\r\nhe wrote the order to General Miles authorizing him to manacle and\r\nfetter Jefferson Davis and Clement C. Clay, Jr., whenever he thought\r\nit advisable, the Secretary of War being in fear that some of the\r\nprisoners of state might escape or kill themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MR. DANA AT FIFTY\r\n    From a Photograph Taken in 1869, a Year After He Obtained\r\n    Control of “The Sun.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nDana then and afterward resented the suggestion that the president\r\nof the fallen Confederacy had met with cruelty or injustice while he\r\nwas confined in Fortress Monroe. In his “Recollections of the Civil\r\nWar,” he said:\r\n\r\n    Medical officers were directed to superintend his meals and\r\n    give him everything that would excite his appetite. As it was\r\n    complained that his quarters in the casemate were unhealthy and\r\n    disagreeable, he was, after a few weeks, transferred to Carroll\r\n    Hall, a building still occupied by officers and soldiers. That\r\n    Davis’s health was not ruined by his imprisonment at Fort\r\n    Monroe is proved by the fact that he came out of prison in\r\n    better condition than when he went in, and that he lived for\r\n    twenty years afterward, and died of old age.\r\n\r\nA new newspaper, the _Daily Republican_, was started in Chicago, a few\r\nweeks after the close of the Civil War, by Senator Trumbull and other\r\nprominent Illinoisans. They asked Dana to become its editor. His work\r\nin the War Department was done, and he had hoped to go into business,\r\nfor his own estimate of his power as a journalist was not as flattering\r\nas the opinions of those who knew him. Yet the Chicago proposition was\r\nattractive on paper, for its capital was fixed at the large sum of five\r\nhundred thousand dollars--an amount sufficient, in those days, to carry\r\non any intelligently managed journal.\r\n\r\nDana resigned as Assistant Secretary of War on July 1, 1865, went\r\nto Chicago, and became editor of the _Republican_. No man was more\r\nintellectually fit for the editorship of a newspaper in that hour of\r\nreconstruction. He had been a real Republican from the founding of the\r\nparty. He cared little for the new President, Andrew Johnson, and the\r\n_Republican_ was more inclined toward the side of Stanton, who differed\r\nwith Johnson as to the methods which should be used in the remaking of\r\nthe South. Of Johnson, Dana wrote to General Wilson:\r\n\r\n    The President is an obstinate, stupid man, governed by\r\n    preconceived ideas, by whisky, and by women. He means one thing\r\n    to-day and another to-morrow, but the glorification of Andrew\r\n    Johnson all the time.\r\n\r\nThe statement that the capital stock of the _Republican_ was fixed at\r\nhalf a million dollars must now be qualified. It was fixed on paper,\r\nbut not in the banks. Little of the money was actually paid in, and\r\nsome of the subscribers were not solvent. Dana worked hard with his\r\npen, but the _Republican_ had not enough backing to hold it up. After\r\none year of it Dana resigned and came East, determined to start a paper\r\nin New York.\r\n\r\nHe had friends of influence and wealth who were glad to be associated\r\nwith him. These included:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Hitchcock\r\n  Isaac W. England\r\n  Charles S. Weyman\r\n  John H. Sherwood\r\n  M. O. Roberts\r\n  George Opdyke\r\n  E. D. Smith\r\n  F. A. Palmer\r\n  William H. Webb\r\n  Roscoe Conkling\r\n  A. B. Cornell\r\n  E. D. Morgan\r\n  David Dows\r\n  John C. Hamilton\r\n  Amos R. Eno\r\n  S. B. Chittenden\r\n  Freeman Clarke\r\n  Thomas Murphy\r\n  William M. Evarts\r\n  Cyrus W. Field\r\n  E. C. Cowdin\r\n  Salem H. Wales\r\n  Theron R. Butler\r\n  Marshall B. Blake\r\n  F. A. Conkling\r\n  A. A. Low\r\n  Charles E. Butler\r\n  Dorman B. Eaton\r\n\r\nThe most eminent of this distinguished group was, of course, William\r\nM. Evarts, then the leader of the American bar. He had been counsel\r\nfor the State of New York in the Lemmon slave case, pitted against\r\nCharles O’Connor, counsel for the State of Virginia. He became chief\r\ncounsel for President Johnson in the impeachment proceedings of 1868,\r\nand later was Johnson’s Attorney-General. He was chief counsel for the\r\nUnited States in the Alabama arbitration, senior counsel for Henry\r\nWard Beecher in the Tilton case, Secretary of State under Hayes, and a\r\nUnited States Senator from 1885 to 1891.\r\n\r\nRoscoe Conkling was a United States Senator from New York at the time\r\nwhen Dana bought the _Sun_. He was one of Grant’s strongest supporters,\r\nand led the third-term movement in 1880. His brother, Frederick\r\nAugustus Conkling, was the Republican candidate for mayor of New York\r\nin the first year that Dana controlled the _Sun_, although later he\r\nchanged his politics, supporting Tilden in 1876, and Hancock in 1880.\r\n\r\nEdwin D. Morgan was Conkling’s colleague in the Senate, where he served\r\nfrom 1863 to 1869. He was Governor of New York from 1858 to 1862. He,\r\nlike most of Dana’s associates, was a Grant man, and it was Morgan who\r\nmanaged Grant’s second Presidential campaign.\r\n\r\nAlonzo B. Cornell, then only thirty-six years old, had risen from\r\nbeing a boy telegrapher to a directorship in the Western Union. He was\r\nalready prominent in the Republican politics of New York State, and was\r\nafterward Governor for three years (1880–1882).\r\n\r\nGeorge Opdyke, a loyal Lincoln man, had been mayor of New York in the\r\ntrying years of 1862 and 1863.\r\n\r\nCyrus W. Field had won world-wide distinction as the Columbus of modern\r\ntimes, as John Bright called him. Two years before Dana bought the\r\n_Sun_ Field had succeeded, after many reverses, in making the Atlantic\r\ncable a permanent success.\r\n\r\nAmos R. Eno, merchant and banker, was the man who had made New York\r\nlaugh by building the Fifth Avenue Hotel so far north--away up at\r\nTwenty-Third Street--that it was known as Eno’s Folly. This he did\r\nnearly ten years before Dana went to the _Sun_, and in 1868 the hotel\r\nwas not only the most fashionable in the United States, but the most\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nA. A. Low was a merchant and the father of Seth Low, later mayor of\r\nNew York. William H. Webb was a big ship-builder. Thomas Murphy was\r\na Republican politician whom Grant made collector of the port of New\r\nYork, and who gave Grant his place at Long Branch as a summer home.\r\n\r\nAt least three of the men in the list were active in the _Sun_\r\noffice. Thomas Hitchcock was a young man of wealth and scholarship\r\nwho had become acquainted with Dana when both were interested in\r\nSwedenborgianism. He wrote, among other books, a catechism of that\r\ndoctrine. For many years he contributed to the _Sun_, under the name\r\n“Matthew Marshall,” financial articles which appeared on Mondays, and\r\nwhich were regarded as the best reviews and criticisms of their kind.\r\n\r\nCharles S. Weyman got out the _Weekly Sun_, and edited that delightful\r\ncolumn, “Sunbeams.”\r\n\r\nSalem H. Wales was a merchant whose daughter became Mrs. Elihu Root.\r\nDorman B. Eaton was one of the pioneers of civil-service reform.\r\nMarshall O. Roberts, F. A. Palmer, David Dows, and E. C. Cowdin were\r\ngreat names in the business and financial world.\r\n\r\nWhy Dana and his friends did not start a new paper is explained in the\r\nfollowing letter, written by Dana to General Wilson:\r\n\r\n    Just as we were about commencing our own paper, the purchase of\r\n    the _Sun_ was proposed to me and accepted. It had a circulation\r\n    of from fifty to sixty thousand a day, and all among the\r\n    mechanics and small merchants of this city. We pay a large\r\n    sum for it--$175,000--but it gives us at once a large and\r\n    profitable business.\r\n\r\n    If you have a thousand dollars at leisure, you had better\r\n    invest it in the stock of our company, which is increased to\r\n    $350,000 in order to pay for the new acquisition. Of this sum\r\n    about $220,000 is invested in the Tammany Hall real estate,\r\n    which is sure to be productive, independent of the business of\r\n    the paper.\r\n\r\nThe “Tammany Hall real estate” was the building at the corner of\r\nNassau and Frankfort Streets, where Tammany kept its headquarters\r\nfrom 1811, when it moved from Martling’s Long Room, at Nassau and\r\nSpruce Streets, to 1867, when Dana and his friends bought the building\r\nwith the expectation of starting a new paper. If Moses S. Beach had\r\nattracted Dana’s attention to the _Sun_ in time, he might have sold\r\nhim, as well as the paper, his own building at Nassau and Fulton\r\nStreets. But the Tammany Hall building was a better-placed home for the\r\n_Sun_ than its old quarters. It faced City Hall Park and was a part of\r\nPrinting-House Square. Dana was right about the productiveness of the\r\nreal estate, for no spot in New York sees more pedestrians go by than\r\nthe Nassau-Frankfort corner. The _Sun_ lived there for forty-three\r\nyears, and its present home, taken when the old hall became too small\r\nand ancient, is only a block away.\r\n\r\nThe first number of the _Sun_ issued under Dana--Monday, January 27,\r\n1868--contained a long sketch of Tammany Hall and its former home,\r\nconcluding:\r\n\r\n    Peace succeeds to strife. No new Halleck can sing:\r\n\r\n  There’s a barrel of porter at Tammany Hall,\r\n    And the Bucktails are enjoying it all the night long;\r\n  In the time of my boyhood ’twas pleasant to call\r\n    For a seat and cigar ’mid the jovial throng.\r\n\r\n    So far as the corner of Nassau and Frankfort Streets is\r\n    concerned, _L’Empire est paix_. The _Sun_ shines for all; and\r\n    on the site of old Tammany’s troubles and tribulations we turn\r\n    back the leaves of the past, dispel the clouds of discord, and\r\n    shed our beams far and near over the Regenerated Land.\r\n\r\nDana changed the appearance of the _Sun_ overnight. He kept it as a\r\nfolio, for he always believed in a four-page paper, even when he was\r\nprinting ten pages, but he reduced the number of columns on a page from\r\neight to seven, widening each column a little.\r\n\r\nThe principal head-lines, which had been irregular in size and two to\r\nthe page, were made smaller and more uniform, and four appeared at the\r\ntop of the front page. The editorial articles, which had been printed\r\nin minion, now appeared a size larger, in brevier, and the heads on\r\nthem were changed to the simple, dignified full-face type of the size\r\nthat is still used.\r\n\r\nDana changed the title-head of the _Sun_ from Roman, which it had\r\nbeen from the beginning, to Old English, as it stands to-day. He also\r\nchanged the accompanying emblem. It had been a variation of the seal\r\nof the State of New York, with the sun rising in splendour behind\r\nmountains; on the right, Liberty with her Phrygian cap held on a staff,\r\ngazing at an outbound vessel; on the left, Justice with scales and\r\nsword, so facing that if not blindfolded she would see a locomotive and\r\na train of cars crossing a bridge. These classic figures were kept, but\r\nthe eagle--the State crest--which brooded above the sunburst in Beach’s\r\ntime, was removed, so that the rays went skyward without hindrance.\r\n\r\nDana liked “It Shines for All,” the _Sun’s_ old motto--everybody liked\r\nit, but only one newspaper, the _Herald_, ever had the effrontery to\r\npilfer it--but he took it from the scroll in the emblem and replaced\r\nthere the State motto, “Excelsior.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_, under its new master, rose auspiciously--master, not\r\nmasters, for in spite of the number of his financial associates,\r\nDana was absolute. The men behind him realized the folly of dividing\r\nauthority. The _Sun_, whether under Day or one of the Beaches, had\r\nalways been a one-man paper. Therefore it succeeded, just as the\r\n_Herald_, another journal governed by an autocrat, went ahead; but with\r\nthe _Tribune_, where the stockholders ruled and argued, things were\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nDana was the boss. As General Wilson wrote in his biography:\r\n\r\n    From this time forth it may be truthfully said that Dana was\r\n    the _Sun_, and the _Sun_ Dana. He was the sole arbiter of its\r\n    policy, and it was his constant practice to supervise every\r\n    editorial contribution that came in while he was on duty. The\r\n    editorial page was absolutely his, whether he wrote a line in\r\n    it or not, and he gave it the characteristic compactness of\r\n    form and directness of statement which were ever afterward its\r\n    distinguishing features.\r\n\r\nDana was a man whose natural intellectual gifts had been augmented by\r\nhis travels, his experience on the _Tribune_, his exploits in the war,\r\nand his association with the big men of his time. Add to all this his\r\nsolid financial backing and his acquirement of a paper with a large\r\ncirculation, and the combination seemed an assurance of success. Yet,\r\nhad Dana lacked the peculiarly human qualities that were his, the\r\nindefinable newspaper instinct that knows when a tom-cat on the steps\r\nof the City Hall is more important than a crisis in the Balkans, the\r\n_Sun_ would have set.\r\n\r\nOnly genius could enable a lofty-minded Republican, with a Republican\r\naristocracy behind him, to take over the _Sun_ and make a hundred\r\nthousand mechanics and tradesmen, nearly all Democrats, like their\r\npaper better than ever before. And that is what Dana did, except\r\nthat he added to the _Sun’s_ former readers a new army of admirers,\r\nrecruited by the magic of his pen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDANA: HIS “SUN” AND ITS CITY\r\n\r\n  _The Period of the Great Personal Journalists.--Dana’s Avoidance of\r\n    Rules and Musty Newspaper Conventions.--His Choice of Men and His\r\n    Broad Definition of News._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dana came into control of the _Sun_, the city of New York, which\r\nthen included only Manhattan and the Bronx, had less than a million\r\npopulation, yet it supported, or was asked to support, almost as many\r\nnewspapers as it has to-day. That was the day of the great personal\r\neditor. Bennett had his _Herald_, with James Gordon Bennett, Jr.,\r\nas his chief helper. Horace Greeley was known throughout America as\r\nthe editor of the _Tribune_. Henry J. Raymond was at the head of\r\nthe _Times_. Manton Marble--who died in England in 1917--was the\r\nintellectual chief of the highly intellectual _World_.\r\n\r\nThe greatest Republican politician of that day, Thurlow Weed, was\r\nthe editor of the _Commercial Advertiser_. He had just changed his\r\npolitical throne from the Astor House to the comparatively new Fifth\r\nAvenue Hotel. Weed was seventy-one years old, but not the Nestor of New\r\nYork editors, for William Cullen Bryant was three years his senior and\r\nstill the active editor of the _Evening Post_. The _Evening Express_,\r\nlater to be incorporated with the _Mail_, was ruled by the brothers\r\nBrooks, James as editor-in-chief and Erastus as manager. David M. Stone\r\nran the _Journal of Commerce_. Ben Wood owned the only penny paper\r\nin town--the _Evening News_. Marcus M. Pomeroy, better known as Brick\r\nPomeroy, had just started his sensational sheet, the _Democrat_, on\r\nthe strength of the reputation he had won in the West as editor of the\r\nLa Crosse _Democrat_. Later he changed the title of the _Democrat_ to\r\n_Pomeroy’s Advance Thought_.\r\n\r\nThese were the men who assailed or defended the methods of the\r\nreconstruction of the South; who stood up for President Johnson, or\r\ncried for his impeachment; who supported the Presidential ambitions of\r\nGrant, then the looming figure in national politics, or decried the\r\nelevation of one whose fame had been exclusively military; who hammered\r\nat the wicked gates of Tammany Hall, or tried to excuse its methods.\r\n\r\nTweed had not yet committed his magnificent atrocities of loot, but he\r\nwas practically the boss of the city, at the same time a State Senator\r\nand the street commissioner. John Kelly, then forty-six--two years the\r\nsenior of the boss--was sheriff of New York. Richard Croker, who was\r\nto succeed Kelly as Kelly succeeded Tweed at the head of the wigwam,\r\nwas then a stocky youth of twenty-five, engineer of a fire-department\r\nsteamer and the leader of the militant youth of Fourth Avenue. He was\r\nalready actively concerned in politics, allied with the Young Democracy\r\nthat was rising against Tweed. In the year when Dana took the _Sun_,\r\nCroker was elected an alderman.\r\n\r\nA slender boy of ten played in those days in Madison Square Park, hard\r\nby his home in East Twentieth Street, just east of Broadway. His name\r\nwas Theodore Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nNew York’s richest man was William B. Astor, with a fortune of perhaps\r\nfifty million dollars. He was then seventy-six years old, but he walked\r\nevery day from his home in Lafayette Place--from its windows he could\r\nsee the Bowery, which had been a real bouwerie in his boyhood--to the\r\nlittle office in Prince Street where he worked all day at the tasks\r\nthat fell upon the shoulders of the Landlord of New York. He probably\r\nnever had heard of John D. Rockefeller, a prosperous young oil man in\r\nthe Middle West.\r\n\r\nCornelius Vanderbilt, only two years younger than Astor, was president\r\nof the New York Central Railroad, and was linking together the great\r\nrailway system that is now known by his name, battling the while\r\nagainst the strategy of Jay Gould and his sinister associates. By\r\nfar the most imposing figure in financial America, Vanderbilt had\r\neverything in the world that he wanted--except Dexter, and that great\r\ntrotter was in the stable of Robert Bonner, who was not only rich\r\nenough to keep Dexter, but could afford to pay Henry Ward Beecher\r\nthirty thousand dollars for a novel, “Norwood,” to be printed serially\r\nin the _Ledger_.\r\n\r\nOnly one other New Yorker of 1868 ranked in wealth with Astor and\r\nVanderbilt--Alexander T. Stewart, whose yearly income was perhaps\r\ngreater than either’s. He was then worth about thirty million dollars,\r\nand he had astonished the business world by building a retail shop on\r\nBroadway, between Ninth and Tenth Streets--now half of Wanamaker’s--at\r\na cost of two millions and three-quarters.\r\n\r\nIn Wall Street the big names were August Belmont, Larry Jerome, Jay\r\nGould, Daniel Drew, and Jim Fisk. Gould and Fisk were doing what\r\nthey pleased with Erie stock. They and the leaders of Tammany Hall,\r\nlike Tweed and Peter B. Sweeny and Slippery Dick Connelly, hatched\r\nschemes for fortunes as they sat either in the Hoffman House, where\r\nFisk sometimes lived, or at dinner in the house in West Twenty-Third\r\nStreet, where the only woman at table was Josie Mansfield.\r\n\r\nOf the great hotels of that day not more than one or two are left. The\r\nFifth Avenue then took rank not only as the finest hostelry in New\r\nYork, but perhaps in the world. The Hoffman House was running as a\r\nEuropean-plan hotel. It had not yet become a Democratic headquarters,\r\nfor the Democrats still preferred the New York, on the American plan.\r\nThe other big “everything included” hotels were the St. Nicholas, where\r\nMiddle West folk stayed, and the Metropolitan, where the exploiter of\r\nmining-stock held forth. Among the smaller and European-plan hotels\r\nwere the St. James, the St. Denis, the Everett, and the Clarendon,\r\nall more or less fashionable, and the Brevoort and the Barcelona,\r\npatronized largely by foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe restaurants were limited in number, for New York had not acquired\r\nthe restaurant habit as strongly as it has it now. When you have\r\nmentioned Delmonico’s, Taylor’s, Curet’s, and the Café de l’Université,\r\nyou have almost a complete list of the places to which fashion drove in\r\nits brougham after the theatre.\r\n\r\nThe playhouses were plentiful enough, considering the size of the\r\ncity. None was north of Twenty-Fourth Street. Wallack’s, at Broadway\r\nand Thirteenth Street, was considered the best theatre in America. The\r\nGrand Opera House, at Eighth Avenue and Twenty-Third Street, was called\r\nthe handsomest. Surely it was costly enough, for Jim Fisk, who had his\r\nown way with Erie finances, paid eight hundred thousand dollars of the\r\nrailroad stockholders’ gold for it, to buy it from the railroad later\r\nwith some of its own stock, of problematical value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE FIRST NUMBER OF “THE SUN” UNDER DANA\r\n    The Title Heading Has Remained Unchanged for Fifty Years.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE HOME OF “THE SUN” FROM 1868 TO 1915\r\n    The Famous Old Building at Nassau and Spruce Streets.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Academy of Music, at Fourteenth Street and Irving Place, housed\r\nItalian opera. The Théâtre Français, also on Fourteenth Street,\r\nbut near Sixth Avenue, was the original home in this country of opera\r\nbouffe. Opera burlesque prevailed at the Fifth Avenue Opera House,\r\non West Twenty-Fourth Street. The Olympic, on Broadway near Houston,\r\nhad been built for Laura Keene; it was there that Edward A. Sothern\r\nfirst appeared under his own name. Barney Williams, the _Sun’s_ first\r\nnewsboy, was managing the Broadway Theatre, in Broadway near Broome\r\nStreet. Edwin Booth was building a fine theatre of his own at Sixth\r\nAvenue and Twenty-Third Street--destined to score an artistic but not a\r\nfinancial success.\r\n\r\nClub life was well advanced. In the house of the Century Club, then\r\nin East Fifteenth Street, the member would come upon Bayard Taylor,\r\nGeorge William Curtis, Parke Godwin, William Allen Butler, Edwin\r\nBooth, Lester Wallack, John Jacob Astor, August Belmont. The Union\r\nLeague was young, and was just about to move from a rented home at\r\nBroadway and Seventeenth Street to the Jerome house, at Madison Avenue\r\nand Twenty-Sixth Street, where it remained until 1881, then to go to\r\nits present home in Fifth Avenue at Thirty-Ninth Street. In the Union\r\nLeague could be seen John Jay, Horace Greeley, William E. Dodge, and\r\nother enthusiastic Republicans. Upon occasion Mr. Dana went there, but\r\nhe was not an ardent clubman.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the New York of Dana’s first year as an absolute editor\r\nwas an interesting island, with just about as much of virtue and vice,\r\nwisdom and folly, sunlight and drabness, as may be found on any island\r\nof nine hundred thousand people. He did not set out to reform it. He\r\ndid not try to turn the general journalism of that day out of certain\r\ndeep grooves into which it had sunk. He had his own ideas of what news\r\nwas, how it should be written, how displayed; but they were ideas, not\r\ntheories. He was not perturbed because the _Sun_ had not handled a big\r\nstory just the way the _Herald_ or the _Tribune_ dished it up; nor was\r\nit of the slightest consequence to him what Mr. Bennett or Mr. Greeley\r\nthought of the way the _Sun_ used the story.\r\n\r\nDana made no rules. Other newspapers have printed commandments for\r\ntheir writers, but the _Sun_ has never wasted a penny’s worth of\r\npaper on rules. If there ever was a rule in the office, it was “Be\r\ninteresting,” and it was not only an unwritten rule, but generally an\r\nunspoken one.\r\n\r\nDana’s realization that journalism was a profession which could be\r\nneither guided nor governed by set rules was expressed in a speech made\r\nby him before the Wisconsin Editorial Association at Milwaukee, in 1888:\r\n\r\n    There is no system of maxims or professional rules that I\r\n    know of that is laid down for the guidance of the journalist.\r\n    The physician has his system of ethics and that sublime oath\r\n    of Hippocrates which human wisdom has never transcended. The\r\n    lawyer also has his code of ethics and the rules of the courts\r\n    and the rules of practice which he is instructed in; but I\r\n    have never met with a system of maxims that seemed to me to be\r\n    perfectly adapted to the general direction of a newspaperman. I\r\n    have written down a few principles which occurred to me, which,\r\n    with your permission, gentlemen, I will read for the benefit of\r\n    the young newspapermen here to-night:\r\n\r\n    Get the news, get all the news, get nothing but the news.\r\n\r\n    Copy nothing from another publication without perfect credit.\r\n\r\n    Never print an interview without the knowledge and consent of\r\n    the party interviewed.\r\n\r\n    Never print a paid advertisement as news-matter. Let every\r\n    advertisement appear as an advertisement; no sailing under\r\n    false colors.\r\n\r\n    Never attack the weak or the defenseless, either by argument,\r\n    by invective, or by ridicule, unless there is some absolute\r\n    public necessity for so doing.\r\n\r\n    Fight for your opinions, but do not believe that they contain\r\n    the whole truth or the only truth.\r\n\r\n    Support your party, if you have one; but do not think all the\r\n    good men are in it and all the bad ones outside of it.\r\n\r\n    Above all, know and believe that humanity is advancing; that\r\n    there is progress in human life and human affairs; and that, as\r\n    sure as God lives, the future will be greater and better than\r\n    the present or the past.\r\n\r\nIn other words, don’t loaf, don’t cheat, don’t dissemble, don’t bully,\r\ndon’t be narrow, don’t grouch. Mr. Dana’s maxims were as applicable to\r\nany other business as to his own. In a lecture delivered at Cornell\r\nUniversity in 1894--three years before his death--Mr. Dana uttered more\r\nmaxims “of value to a newspaper-maker”:\r\n\r\n    Never be in a hurry.\r\n\r\n    Hold fast to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n    Stand by the Stars and Stripes. Above all, stand for liberty,\r\n    whatever happens.\r\n\r\n    A word that is not spoken never does any mischief.\r\n\r\n    All the goodness of a good egg cannot make up for the badness\r\n    of a bad one.\r\n\r\n    If you find you have been wrong, don’t fear to say so.\r\n\r\nAll these maxims were quite as useful to the merchant as to the\r\nnewspaperman. They related to the broad conduct of life. They\r\ncounselled against folly, so far as the making of newspapers was\r\nconcerned, but they did not convey the mysterious prescription with\r\nwhich Dana revived American journalism from that trance in which it\r\nhad forgotten that everybody is human and that the English language is\r\nalive and fluid.\r\n\r\nIf there had been rules by which a living newspaper could be made\r\nfrom men and ink and wood-pulp, Dana would have known them; but there\r\nwere none, nor are there now. The present editor of the _Sun_, E. P.\r\nMitchell, who knew Dana better than any other man knew him, said in an\r\naddress at the Pulitzer School of Journalism a few years ago:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dana used to lecture on journalism sometimes, when he was\r\n    invited, but in the bottom of my heart I don’t believe he had\r\n    any theories of journalism other than common sense and free\r\n    play for individual talent when discovered and available.\r\n    And I do remember distinctly that when he sent Mr. Joseph\r\n    Pulitzer, then fresh from St. Louis, on to Washington to\r\n    report in semieditorial correspondence the critical stage of\r\n    the electoral controversy of 1876, Mr. Dana did not think it\r\n    necessary to instruct that correspondent to assimilate his\r\n    style to the _Sun’s_ methods and traditions. Never was a job of\r\n    momentous journalistic importance better done in the absence\r\n    of plain sailing directions; but that, perhaps, was due partly\r\n    to the fact that Mr. Pulitzer was somewhat of an individualist\r\n    himself.\r\n\r\n    For the ancient common law of journalism, as derived from\r\n    England, and perhaps before that from away back in Bœotia, Mr.\r\n    Dana didn’t care one comic supplement. If anybody had asked\r\n    Mr. Dana to compile a set of specific directions for running a\r\n    newspaper, his reply, I am sure, would have been something like\r\n    this:\r\n\r\n    “Heaven bless you, young man, there aren’t any rules! Go ahead\r\n    and write when you have something to say, not when you think\r\n    you ought to say something. I’ll edit out the nonsense. And,\r\n    by the way, unless there happens to have been born into your\r\n    noddle a little bit of the native aptitude, you ought to go and\r\n    be a lawyer or a farmer or a banker or a great statesman.”\r\n\r\nMr. Dana had no regard for typographical gymnastics. To him a head-line\r\nwas something to fill the mind rather than the eye. He knew the utter\r\nimpossibility of trying to startle the reader eight times in as many\r\nadjacent columns--a feat which Mr. Bennett and some of his imitators\r\nseemed to consider feasible. Surprise is not the only emotion upon\r\nwhich a newspaper can play. The _Sun_ stretched all the human octaves\r\nfrom horror to amusement, but the keys of horror were only touched when\r\nit was necessary.\r\n\r\nMake rules for news? How is it possible to make a rule for something\r\nthe value of which lies in the fact that it is the narrative of what\r\nnever had happened, in exactly the same way, before? John Bogart, a\r\ncity editor of the _Sun_ who absorbed the Dana idea of news and the\r\nhandling thereof, once said to a young reporter:\r\n\r\n“When a dog bites a man, that is not news, because it happens so often.\r\nBut if a man bites a dog, that is news.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ always waited for the man to bite the dog.\r\n\r\nHere is Mr. Dana’s own definition of news:\r\n\r\n    The first thing which an editor must look for is news. If the\r\n    newspaper has not the news it may have everything else, yet\r\n    it will be comparatively unsuccessful; and by news I mean\r\n    everything that occurs, everything which is of human interest,\r\n    and which is of sufficient interest to arrest and absorb the\r\n    attention of the public or of any considerable part of it.\r\n\r\n    There is a great disposition in some quarters to say that the\r\n    newspapers ought to limit the amount of news that they print;\r\n    that certain kinds of news ought not to be published. I do not\r\n    know how that is. I am not prepared to maintain any abstract\r\n    proposition in that line; but I have always felt that whatever\r\n    the divine Providence permitted to occur I was not too proud to\r\n    report.\r\n\r\nA belief has been accepted in some quarters that the _Sun_ of Dana’s\r\ntime preferred college men for its staff. This was in a way false, but\r\nit is true that a great many of the _Sun’s_ young men came from the\r\ncolleges. Mr. Dana’s views on the matter of educational equipment were\r\nquite plainly expressed by himself:\r\n\r\n    If I could have my way, every young man who is going to be a\r\n    newspaperman, and who is not absolutely rebellious against it,\r\n    should learn Greek and Latin after the good old fashion. I had\r\n    rather take a young fellow who knows the “Ajax” of Sophocles,\r\n    and has read Tacitus, and can scan every ode of Horace--I would\r\n    rather take him to report a prize-fight or a spelling-match,\r\n    for instance, than to take one who has never had those\r\n    advantages.\r\n\r\n    At the same time, the cultivated man is not in every case the\r\n    best reporter. One of the best I ever knew was a man who could\r\n    not spell four words correctly to save his life, and his verb\r\n    did not always agree with the subject in person and number; but\r\n    he always got the fact so exactly, and he saw the picturesque,\r\n    the interesting, the important aspect of it so vividly, that it\r\n    was worth another man’s while, who possessed the knowledge of\r\n    grammar and spelling, to go over the report and write it out.\r\n\r\n    Now, that was a man who had genius; he had a talent the most\r\n    indubitable, and he got handsomely paid in spite of his lack of\r\n    grammar, because after his work had been done over by a scholar\r\n    it was really beautiful. But any man who is sincere and earnest\r\n    and not always thinking about himself can be a good reporter.\r\n    He can learn to ascertain the truth; he can acquire the habit\r\n    of seeing.\r\n\r\n    When he looks at a fire, what is the most important thing about\r\n    that fire? Here, let us say, are five houses burning; which is\r\n    the greatest? Whose store is that which is burning? And who has\r\n    met with the greatest loss? Has any individual perished in the\r\n    conflagration? Are there any very interesting circumstances\r\n    about the fire? How did it occur? Was it like Chicago, where a\r\n    cow kicked over a spirit-lamp and burned up the city?\r\n\r\n    All these things the reporter has to judge about. He is the eye\r\n    of the paper, and he is there to see which is the vital fact\r\n    in the story, and to produce it, tell it, write it out.\r\n\r\nDana saw the usefulness to a reporter of certain qualities which are\r\nacquired neither at school nor in the office:\r\n\r\n    In the first place, he must know the truth when he hears it\r\n    and sees it. There are a great many men who are born without\r\n    that faculty, unfortunately. But there are some men that a\r\n    lie cannot deceive; and that is a very precious gift for a\r\n    reporter, as well as for anybody else. The man who has it is\r\n    sure to live long and prosper; especially if he is able to tell\r\n    the truth which he sees, to state the fact or the discovery\r\n    that he has been sent out after, in a clear and vivid and\r\n    interesting manner.\r\n\r\n    The invariable law of the newspaper is to be interesting.\r\n    Suppose you tell all the truths of science in a way that bores\r\n    the reader; what is the good? The truths don’t stay in the\r\n    mind, and nobody thinks any the better of you because you have\r\n    told the truth tediously. The reporter must give his story in\r\n    such a way that you know he feels its qualities and events and\r\n    is interested in them.\r\n\r\nDana was catholic not only in his taste for news, but in his idea of\r\nthe manner of writing it. Nothing gave him more uneasiness than to find\r\nthat a _Sun_ man was drifting into a stereotyped way of handling a news\r\nstory or writing an editorial article. Even as he advised young men to\r\nread everything from Shakespeare and Milton down, he repeatedly warned\r\nthem against the imitation, unconscious or otherwise, of another’s\r\nstyle:\r\n\r\n    Do not take any model. Every man has his own natural style, and\r\n    the thing to do is to develop it into simplicity and clearness.\r\n    Do not, for instance, labor after such a style as Matthew\r\n    Arnold’s--one of the most beautiful styles that has ever been\r\n    seen in any literature. It is no use to try to get another\r\n    man’s style or to imitate the wit or the mannerisms of another\r\n    writer. The late Mr. Carlyle, for example, did, in my judgment,\r\n    a considerable mischief in his day, because he led everybody to\r\n    write after the style of his “French Revolution,” and it became\r\n    pretty tedious.\r\n\r\nIf a writer could not keep on without aping the literary fashion of\r\nanother, then he was not for the _Sun_. Dana wanted good English\r\nalways, but a constant spice of variety in the treatment of a subject,\r\nand in the style itself; therefore he chose a variety of men.\r\n\r\nIf he believed that the best report of a ship-launching could be\r\nwritten by a longshoreman, he would have hired the hard-handed toiler\r\nand assigned him to the job. He wanted men who would look at the world\r\nwith open eyes and find the new things that were going on. Dana knew\r\nthat they were going on. His vision had not been narrowed by too close\r\napplication to newspaper offices where editors and managing editors had\r\nhandled the stock stories year in and year out in the same wearisome\r\nway.\r\n\r\nTo Dana life was not a mere procession of elections, legislatures,\r\ntheatrical performances, murders, and lectures. Life was everything--a\r\nnew kind of apple, a crying child on the curb, a policeman’s epigram,\r\nthe exact weight of a candidate for President, the latest style in\r\nwhiskers, the origin of a new slang expression, the idiosyncrasies\r\nof the City Hall clock, a strange four-master in the harbour, the\r\nhead-dresses of Syrian girls, a new president or a new football coach\r\nat Yale, a vendetta in Mulberry Bend--everything was fish to the great\r\nnet of Dana’s mind.\r\n\r\nHuman interest! It is an old phrase now, and one likely to cause lips\r\nto curl along Park Row. But the art of picking out the happenings of\r\nevery-day life that would appeal to every reader, if so depicted that\r\nthe events lived before the reader’s eye, was an art that did not exist\r\nuntil Dana came along. Ben Day knew the importance of the trifles of\r\nlife and the hold they took on the people who read his little _Sun_,\r\nbut it remained for Dana to bring out in journalism the literary\r\nquality that made the trifle live. Whether it was an item of three\r\nlines or an article of three columns, it must have life, or it had no\r\nplace in the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nDana did not teach his men how to do it. If he taught them anything,\r\nit was what not to do. His men did the work he wanted them to do, not\r\nby following instructions, but by being unhampered by instructions. He\r\nset the writer free and let him go his own way to glory or failure.\r\nThere were no conventions except those of decency, of respect for the\r\nEnglish language. Because newspapermen had been doing a certain thing\r\nin a certain way for a century, Dana could not see why he and his\r\nmen should go in the same wagon-track. With a word or an epigram he\r\ndestroyed traditions that had fettered the profession since the days of\r\nthe Franklin press.\r\n\r\nOne day he held up a string of proofs--a long obituary of Bismarck, or\r\nBlaine, or some celebrity who had just passed away.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lord,” he said to his managing editor, “isn’t that a lot of space\r\nto give to a dead man?”\r\n\r\nYet the next day the same Dana came from his office to the city\r\neditor’s desk to inquire who had written a certain story two inches\r\nlong, and, upon learning, went over to the reporter who was the author.\r\n\r\n“Very good, young man, very good,” he said, pointing to the item. “I\r\nwish I could write like that!”\r\n\r\nNames of writers meant nothing to Dana. He judged everything that was\r\nprinted in the _Sun_, or offered to it for publication, on its own\r\nmerits. He went through manuscript with uncanny speed, the gaze that\r\nseemed to travel only down the centre of the page really taking in the\r\nwhole substance. A dull article from a celebrity he returned to its\r\nenvelope with the note “Respectfully declined,” and without a thought\r\nof the author’s surprise, or possibly rage. But over a poem from an\r\nup-State unknown he might spend half an hour if the verses contained\r\nthe germ of an idea new to him.\r\n\r\nOne clergyman who had come into literary prominence offered to write\r\nsome articles for the _Sun_. Dana told him he might try. The clergyman\r\nevidently had a notion that the _Sun’s_ cleverness was a worldly,\r\nreckless devilishness, and he adapted the style of his first article to\r\nwhat he supposed was the tone of the paper. Dana read it, smiled, wrote\r\nacross the first page “This is too damned wicked,” and mailed it back\r\nto the misguided author.\r\n\r\nHe was a patient man. A clerk in the New York post-office copied by\r\nhand Edward Everett Hale’s story, “The Man Without a Country,” and\r\noffered it to the _Sun_--as original matter--for a hundred dollars. It\r\nwas suggested to Mr. Dana that the poor fool should be exposed.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Dana, “mark it ‘Respectfully declined,’ and send it back to\r\nhim. He has been honest enough to enclose postage-stamps.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nDANA, AS MITCHELL SAW HIM\r\n\r\n  _A Picture of the Room Where One Man Ruled for Thirty Years.--The\r\n    Democratic Ways of a Newspaper Autocrat.--W. O. Bartlett, Pike,\r\n    and His Other Early Associates._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English historian, Kinglake, wrote a description of John T.\r\nDelane, the most famous editor of the London _Times_, which Mr. Dana’s\r\nassociate, Mr. Mitchell, liked to quote as a picture of what Mr.\r\nDana was _not_. It is a fine limning of the great editor, as great\r\neditors were supposed to be before Dana showed his disregard for the\r\njournalistic dust of the ages:\r\n\r\n    From the moment of his entering the editor’s room until four or\r\n    five o’clock in the morning, the strain he had to put on his\r\n    faculties must have been always great, and in stirring times\r\n    almost prodigious. There were hours of night when he often had\r\n    to decide--to decide, of course, with great swiftness--between\r\n    two or more courses of action momentously different; when,\r\n    besides, he must judge the appeals brought up to the paramount\r\n    arbiter from all kinds of men, from all sorts of earthly\r\n    tribunals; when despatches of moment, when telegrams fraught\r\n    with grave tidings, when notes hastily scribbled in the Lords\r\n    or Commons, were from time to time coming in to disturb,\r\n    perhaps even to annul, former reckonings; and these, besides,\r\n    were the hours when, on questions newly obtruding, yet so\r\n    closely, so importunately, present that they would have to be\r\n    met before sunrise, he somehow must cause to spring up sudden\r\n    essays, invectives, and arguments which only strong power of\r\n    brain, with even much toil, could supply. For the delicate\r\n    task any other than he would require to be in a state of\r\n    tranquillity, would require to have ample time. But for him\r\n    there are no such indulgences; he sees the hand of the clock\r\n    growing more and more peremptory, and the time drawing nearer\r\n    and nearer when his paper must, _must_ be made up.\r\n\r\nThat, mark you, was Delane, not Dana. When Mr. Dana counselled the\r\nyoung men at Cornell never to be in a hurry, he meant it. Fury was\r\nnever a part of his system of life and work. Probably he viewed with\r\nsomething like contempt the high-pressure editor of his own and former\r\ndays. There was no agony in the daily birth of the _Sun_. Mr. Mitchell\r\nsaid of his chief:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dana has always been the master, and not the slave, of the\r\n    immediate task. The external features of his journalism are\r\n    simplicity, directness, common sense, and the entire absence\r\n    of affectation. He would no more think of living up to Mr.\r\n    Kinglake’s ideal of a great, mysterious, and thought-burdened\r\n    editor, than of putting on a conical hat and a black robe\r\n    spangled with suns, moons, and stars, when about to receive a\r\n    visitor to his editorial office in Nassau Street.\r\n\r\nThat office in Nassau Street, of which every reader of the _Sun_, and\r\nsurely every newspaperman in America, formed his own mental picture!\r\nTo some imaginations it probably was a bare room, with a desk for the\r\neditor and, close by, the famous cat. To other imaginations, whose\r\nowners were familiar with Mr. Dana’s love for the beautiful, the office\r\nmay have been a studio unmarred by the presence of a single unbeautiful\r\nobject. Both visions were incorrect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_Drawn from Life by Corwin Knapp Linson_)\r\n\r\n    MR. DANA IN HIS OFFICE\r\n]\r\n\r\nSurroundings were nothing to Dana. To him an office was a place to\r\nwork, to convert ideas into readable form. What would works of art be\r\nin such a place to a man who took more interest in the crowds that\r\nwent to and fro on Park Row beneath his window? Let the room itself be\r\ndescribed by Mr. Mitchell, who set down this picture of it after he had\r\nspent hours in it with Mr. Dana almost daily for twenty years:\r\n\r\n    In the middle of the small room a desk-table of black walnut\r\n    of the Fulton Street style and the period of the first\r\n    administration of Grant; a shabby little round table at\r\n    the window, where Mr. Dana sits when the day is dark; one\r\n    leather-covered chair, which does duty at either post, and\r\n    two wooden chairs, both rickety, for visitors on errands of\r\n    business or ceremony; on the desk a revolving case with a\r\n    few dozen books of reference; an ink-pot and pen, not much\r\n    used except in correcting manuscript and proofs, for Mr. Dana\r\n    talks off to a stenographer his editorial articles and his\r\n    correspondence, sometimes spending on the revision of the\r\n    former twice as much time as was required for the dictation;\r\n    a window-seat filled with exchanges, marked here and there\r\n    in blue pencil for the editor’s eyes; a big pair of shears,\r\n    and two or three extra pairs of spectacles in cache against\r\n    an emergency--these few items constitute what is practically\r\n    the whole objective equipment of the editor of the _Sun_. The\r\n    shears are probably the newest article of furniture in the\r\n    list. They replaced, three or four years ago, another pair of\r\n    unknown antiquity, besought and obtained by Eugene Field, and\r\n    now occupying, alongside of Mr. Gladstone’s ax, the place of\r\n    honor in that poet’s celebrated collection of edged instruments.\r\n\r\n    For the non-essentials, the little trapezoid-shaped room\r\n    contains a third table containing a file of the newspaper for\r\n    a few weeks back, and a heap of new books which have passed\r\n    review; an iron umbrella-rack; on the floor a cheap Turkish\r\n    rug; and a lounge covered with horsehide, upon which Mr. Dana\r\n    descends for a five minutes’ nap perhaps five times a year.\r\n\r\n    The adornments of the room are mostly accidental and\r\n    insignificant. Ages ago somebody presented to Mr. Dana, with\r\n    symbolic intent, a large stuffed owl. The bird of wisdom\r\n    remains by inertia on top of the revolving bookcase, just as\r\n    it would have remained there if it had been a stuffed cat or a\r\n    statuette of “Folly.” Unnoticed and probably long ago forgotten\r\n    by the proprietor, the owl solemnly boxes the compass as Mr.\r\n    Dana swings the case, reaching in quick succession for his\r\n    Bible, his Portuguese dictionary, his compendium of botanical\r\n    terms, or his copy of the Democratic national platform of 1892.\r\n    On the mantelpiece is an ugly, feather-haired little totem\r\n    figure from Alaska, which likewise keeps its place solely\r\n    by possession. It stands between a photograph of Chester\r\n    A. Arthur, whom Mr. Dana liked and admired as a man of the\r\n    world, and the japanned calendar-case which has shown him\r\n    the time of year for the last quarter of a century. A dingy\r\n    chromolithograph of Prince von Bismarck stands shoulder to\r\n    shoulder with George, the Count Joannes.\r\n\r\n    The same mingling of sentiment and pure accident marks the rest\r\n    of Mr. Dana’s picture-gallery. There is a large and excellent\r\n    photograph of Horace Greeley, who is held in half-affectionate,\r\n    half-humorous remembrance by his old associate in the\r\n    management of the _Tribune_. Another is of the late Justice\r\n    Blatchford, of the United States Supreme Court; it is the\r\n    strong face of the fearless judge whose decision from the\r\n    Federal bench in New York twenty years ago blocked the attempt\r\n    to drag Mr. Dana before a servile little court in Washington to\r\n    be tried without a jury on the charge of criminal libel, at the\r\n    time when the _Sun_ was demolishing the District Ring.\r\n\r\n    Over the mantel is Abraham Lincoln. There are pictures of the\r\n    four Harper brothers and of the Appletons. Andrew Jackson is\r\n    there twice, once in black and white, once in vivid colors.\r\n    An inexpensive Thomas Jefferson faces the livelier Jackson.\r\n    A framed diploma certifies that Mr. Dana was one of several\r\n    gentlemen who presented to the State a portrait in oils of\r\n    Samuel J. Tilden. On different sides of the room are William\r\n    T. Coleman, the organizer of the San Francisco Vigilantes, and\r\n    a crude colored print of the Haifa colony at the foot of Mount\r\n    Carmel in Syria. Strangest of all in this singular collection\r\n    is a photograph of a tall, lank, and superior-looking New\r\n    England mill-girl, issued as an advertisement by some\r\n    Connecticut concern engaged in the manufacture of spool-cotton.\r\n\r\n    For a good many years the most available wall-space in Mr.\r\n    Dana’s office was occupied by a huge pasteboard chart, showing\r\n    elaborately, in deadly parallel columns, the differences\r\n    in the laws of the several States of the Union respecting\r\n    divorce. It was put there, and it remained there, serving no\r\n    earthly purpose except to illustrate the editor’s indifference\r\n    as to his immediate surroundings, until it disappeared as\r\n    mysteriously as it had come.\r\n\r\nSuch were Mr. Dana’s surroundings, with nothing to indicate, as Mr.\r\nMitchell remarked, that the occupant “knew Manet from Monet, or old\r\nPersian lustre from Gubbio.”\r\n\r\nIt is twenty years since Dana went out of that room for the last time,\r\nand the room and the old building are no more, but the stuffed owl\r\nis still at his post in the office of the editor of the _Sun_. He\r\nis an older if not wiser bird, and he is no longer subjected to the\r\nrevolutions of the bookcase, for Mr. Mitchell has given him a firmer\r\nperch beside his door. From a nearby wall Mr. Dana’s pictures of the\r\nfour Harpers keep vigil, too.\r\n\r\nDana was interested in everything, read everything, saw almost\r\neverybody. His own office was almost as free as the great main office\r\nof the _Sun_, where sat everybody from the managing editor down to the\r\noffice-boy. One day Dana, coming into the big room, saw carpenters\r\nbuilding a partition between the room and the head of the stairs that\r\nled to the street. It was explained to him that the public was inclined\r\nto be unnecessarily intrusive at times.\r\n\r\n“Take the partition down,” he said. “A newspaper is for the public.”\r\n\r\nThat this was not always a desirable plan is illustrated in a story\r\nabout Dana, probably apocryphal, but characteristic. One night the city\r\neditor rushed into his chief’s room.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dana,” he said, “there’s a man out there with a cocked revolver.\r\nHe is very much excited, and he insists on seeing the editor-in-chief.”\r\n\r\n“Is he very much excited?” inquired Mr. Dana, returning to the proof\r\nthat he was reading. “If you think it is worth while, ask Amos Cummings\r\nif he will see the gentleman and write him up.”\r\n\r\nPersons in search of alms would enter Mr. Dana’s room without ceremony.\r\nIf they were Sisters of Charity, as often was the case, Mr. Dana would\r\nwalk up and down, telling them of his visit with the Pope, and would\r\nfinish by giving them one of the silver dollars of which his pocket\r\nseemed to have an endless supply. Almost every day, when he despatched\r\na boy to a nearby restaurant for his sandwich and bottle of milk, he\r\nwould give him a five-dollar bill and instruct him to bring back the\r\nchange all in silver. He liked to jingle the coins in his pocket and to\r\nhave them ready for alms-giving.\r\n\r\nDana was never fussy, never overbearing with his men. He bore patiently\r\nwith the occasional sinner, and tried to put the best face on a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe Dana patience extended also to outsiders. On one occasion William\r\nM. Laffan, then the dramatic critic and later the owner of the _Sun_,\r\nwrote a severe criticism of a performance by Miss Ada Rehan. Augustin\r\nDaly hurried to Mr. Dana’s office the next afternoon.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Dana,” he said, “I have called to try to convince you that you\r\nshould discharge your dramatic editor. He has--”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Dana, smiling. “Well, Mr. Daly, I will speak to Mr.\r\nLaffan about the matter, and if he thinks that he really deserves to be\r\ndischarged, I will most certainly do it!”\r\n\r\nThirty or forty years ago the belief was not uncommon, among those\r\nignorant of editorial methods and the limitations of human powers,\r\nthat Mr. Dana wrote every word that appeared on the editorial page of\r\nthe _Sun_. It is likely that this flattering myth came to his ears and\r\ncaused him more than one chuckle. Dana wrote pieces for the _Sun_, many\r\nof them, but he never essayed the superhuman task of filling the whole\r\npage with his own self. Nobody knew better than he what a bore a man\r\nbecomes who flows opinion constantly, whether by voice or by pen.\r\n\r\nFor Dana, not the eternal verities in allopathic doses, but the\r\nentertaining varieties, carefully administered. He might be immensely\r\ninterested in the destruction of the Whisky Ring, and in writing about\r\nthat infamy articles which would scorch the ears of Washington; but\r\nhe knew that not every man, woman, and child who read the _Sun_ was\r\nfurious about the Whisky Ring or cared to read columns of opinion about\r\nit every day. They must have pabulum in the form of an article about\r\nthe princely earnings of Charles Dickens, or the identification of\r\nMount Sinai, or the mysterious murder of a French count.\r\n\r\nSo he hired men who could compare Dickens’s lectures with Thackeray’s,\r\nor were familiar with the controversy over Mount Barghir, or who knew a\r\nmurder mystery when they saw it. They wrote, and he read and sometimes\r\nedited, but usually approved, for he knew that newspaper success lay\r\nnot so much in a choice of topics as in a choice of men. He knew that\r\nthe success of an editorial page came less from inside opinions than\r\nfrom outside interest. Dana’s remarkable success in the exaltation\r\nof journalism to literary heights was won not so much through what he\r\nwrote, but through what he left other men free to write.\r\n\r\nHis own work as a writer for the _Sun_ took but a fraction of his busy\r\nday. He dictated his articles to Tom Williams, his stenographer, a\r\nFenian and a bold man.\r\n\r\n“Can you write as fast as I talk?” asked Dana when Williams applied for\r\nthe job.\r\n\r\n“I doubt it, Mr. Dana,” said Williams; “but I can write as fast as any\r\nman ought to talk.”\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Tom Williams transcribed articles that absorbed the\r\nreaders of the _Sun_, but his own heart was down the bay, near his\r\nStaten Island home, where he spent most of his spare time in fishing\r\nand sailing. It was always a grief to Williams to enter the office on\r\nan election or similarly important night, and to find that no one paid\r\nany attention to his stories about how the fish were biting.\r\n\r\nDana had no doubt--nor had any one, least of all those who came under\r\nhis editorial condemnation--of his own ability as a trenchant writer.\r\nThe expression of thought was an art which he had studied from boyhood.\r\nWhatever of the academic appeared in his early work had been driven out\r\nduring his service on the _Tribune_ and in the war, particularly the\r\nlatter, for as a reporter for the government he learned to avoid all\r\nbut the salients of expression. But as the editor of the _Sun_ he found\r\nless delight in his own product than in the work of some other man\r\nwhose literary ability answered his own standards of terseness, vigour,\r\nand illumination. The new man would help the _Sun_, and that was all\r\nthat Dana asked.\r\n\r\nThat another man’s work should be mistaken for his own, or his own for\r\nanother man’s, was to Dana nothing at all, except perhaps a source of\r\namusement. The anonymity of the writers on the _Sun_ was so complete\r\nthat the public knew their work only as a whole; but whenever anything\r\nparticularly biting or humorous appeared, the same public instantly\r\ndecided that Dana must have written it.\r\n\r\n  No king, no clown, to rule this town!\r\n\r\nThat line, born in the _Sun’s_ editorial page, will live as long as\r\nShakespeare. In eight words it embodied the protest of New York against\r\nthe arrogance and stupidity of machine political rule. Ten thousand\r\ntimes, at least, it has been credited to Dana, but as a matter of fact\r\nit was written by W. O. Bartlett.\r\n\r\nBartlett was one of those great newspaper writers whose fate--or\r\nchoice--it is never to own a newspaper and never to attract public\r\nattention through the writing of signed articles or books. Writing\r\nwas not primarily his profession, and by the older men of New York\r\nwho remember him he is recalled as a brilliant lawyer rather than\r\nas a writer. He met Dana through Secretary Stanton, and he was the\r\n_Sun’s_ attorney soon after Dana and his friends bought the paper. His\r\nlaw-offices were in the Sun Building, directly below Mr. Dana’s own\r\noffices. There, and also at the Hoffman House, where he lived when he\r\nwas not on his estate at Brookhaven, Long Island, Mr. Bartlett wrote\r\nhis articles for the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nBartlett was a writer of the school of simplicity. His style of\r\nreducing a proposition to its most elementary form, so that it was\r\nclear to even the Class B intellect, was the admiration and envy of\r\nall who knew his articles. It was an inspiration, too, to many young\r\nnewspapermen of his day.\r\n\r\nThe manner of Mr. Arthur Brisbane of the _Evening Journal_, luring\r\nthe reader into a sociological dissertation by first inquiring\r\nwhether he knows “Why a Flea Jumps So Far,” is the Bartlett manner,\r\nwith such modifications as are necessary to reach the attention of a\r\ngroup intellectually somewhat different from Bartlett’s readers. Only\r\nBartlett did not spend too much time on the flea. Of the three men\r\nwhose articles have most distinguished the first column of the _Sun’s_\r\neditorial page, each has had his own weapon when leading to attack.\r\nDana struck with a sword. Mitchell used--and uses--the rapier. Bartlett\r\nswung the mace. It was jewelled with the gems of language, but still\r\nit was a mace; and if it crushed the skull of the enemy at the first\r\nblow, so much the better. It was Bartlett, for instance, who wrote\r\nthe article in which the Democratic candidate for President in 1880,\r\nGeneral Hancock, was referred to as “a good man, weighing two hundred\r\nand forty pounds.”\r\n\r\nW. O. Bartlett wrote for the _Sun_ from 1868 until his death in 1881.\r\nHe was the foremost figure in the group of older men around Dana--the\r\nmen who had been prominent in political and literary life before the\r\nCivil War. Other notable men of middle age who were chosen by Mr. Dana\r\nto write editorial articles were James S. Pike, Fitz-Henry Warren,\r\nHenry B. Stanton, and John Swinton.\r\n\r\nJames Shepherd Pike’s articles appeared more frequently in the columns\r\nof the _Sun_ than Pike himself appeared in the office, for most of his\r\nwork was done in Washington. He was about eight years older than Mr.\r\nDana, but they were great friends from the earliest days of Dana’s\r\n_Tribune_ experience. For five years, beginning in 1855, Pike was\r\na Washington correspondent and one of the associate editors of the\r\n_Tribune_. During the Civil War he was United States minister to the\r\nNetherlands, a reward for his services in his home State, Maine, where\r\nhe was useful in uniting the anti-slavery forces. He was a brother of\r\nFrederick A. Pike, a war-time Representative from Maine, whose “Tax,\r\nfight, emancipate!” was the Republican watchword from its utterance in\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nPike was one of the group that supported Greeley for the Presidency in\r\n1872. He was one of the really great publicists of his day. He wrote\r\n“The Restoration of the Currency,” “The Financial Crisis,” “Horace\r\nGreeley in 1872,” “A Prostrate State”--which was a description of the\r\nReconstruction era in South Carolina--and “The First Blows of the Civil\r\nWar,” this last a volume of reminiscent correspondence, some newspaper,\r\nsome personal. The friendship and literary association of Pike and Dana\r\nlasted more than thirty years, and ended only with Pike’s death in\r\n1882, just after he had passed threescore and ten.\r\n\r\nFitz-Henry Warren, who has been already referred to in this narrative\r\nas the author of the _Tribune’s_ cry, “On to Richmond!” wrote many\r\neditorial articles for Dana, who had conceived a great admiration for\r\nWarren when both were in the service of the _Tribune_, Dana as managing\r\neditor and Warren as head of the Washington bureau. Warren emerged from\r\nthe Civil War not only a major-general, but a powerful politician, and\r\nit was not until several years later, after he had served in the Iowa\r\nSenate and as minister to Guatemala, that Dana was able to bring the\r\npen of this transplanted New Englander to the office of the _Sun_. Once\r\nthere, it did splendid work.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to identify the editorials that appeared in the _Sun_\r\nunder the Dana régime; not so much because of the lapse of years, but\r\nbecause the spirit of Dana so permeated everything that was printed on\r\nhis page that it is difficult to say with certainty, “This Dana wrote,\r\nthis Bartlett, this Mitchell, this Warren, and this Pike.” But, for\r\nthe purpose of giving some small idea of the grace and magnificence of\r\nWarren’s style, here is a paragraph from an editorial article known to\r\nhave been written by him on the death of Charles Sumner in March, 1874:\r\n\r\n    Men spoke softly on the street; their very voices betokened the\r\n    impending event, and even their footfalls are said to have been\r\n    lighter than common. But in the neighborhood of the Senator’s\r\n    house there was a sense of singular and touching interest.\r\n    Splendid equipages rolled to the corner, over pavements\r\n    conceived in fraud and laid in corruption, to testify the\r\n    regard of their occupants for eminent purity of life. Liveried\r\n    servants carried hopeless messages from the door of him who was\r\n    simplicity itself, and to whom the pomp and pageantry of this\r\n    evil day were but the evidences of guilty degeneracy. Through\r\n    all those lingering hours of anguish the sad procession came\r\n    and went.\r\n\r\n    On the sidewalk stood a numerous and grateful representation\r\n    of the race to whom he had given the proudest efforts and the\r\n    best energies of his existence. The black man bowed his head\r\n    in unaffected grief, and the black woman sat hushing her babe\r\n    upon the curbstone, in mute expectation of the last decisive\r\n    intelligence from the chamber above.\r\n\r\nGeneral Warren continued to write for the _Sun_ until 1876, and he\r\ndied two years afterward, when he was only sixty-two years old, in\r\nBrimfield, Massachusetts, the town of his birth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH PULITZER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIHU ROOT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JUDGE WILLARD BARTLETT]\r\n\r\nAlthough Henry Brewster Stanton was a comparatively old man when\r\nhe began writing for the _Sun_, his activities in that line lasted\r\nfor nearly twenty years. In 1826, when he was twenty-one years old,\r\nhe entered newspaper work on Thurlow Weed’s _Monroe Telegraph_,\r\npublished in Rochester. Soon afterward he became an advocate of the\r\nanti-slavery cause. In 1840 he married Elizabeth Cady, and with her\r\nwent abroad, where in Great Britain and France they worked for the\r\nrelief of the slaves in the United States. It was during that journey\r\nthat Elizabeth Cady Stanton signed the first call for a woman’s rights\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nOn his return to America Stanton studied law with his father-in-law,\r\nDaniel Cady. After his admission to the bar he practised in Boston, but\r\nhe returned to New York and politics in 1847. He left the Democratic\r\nparty to become one of the founders of the Republican party.\r\n\r\nDana met Stanton when the latter was a writer for the _Tribune_, and\r\nwhen Dana came into the control of the _Sun_ he secured the veteran\r\nas a contributor. Stanton knew politics from A to Z, and his brief\r\narticles, filled with political wisdom and often salted with his\r\ndry humour, were just the class of matter that Dana wanted for the\r\neditorial page. Stanton was also a capable reviewer of books. He wrote\r\nfor the _Sun_ from 1868 until his death in 1887. Henry Ward Beecher\r\nsaid of him:\r\n\r\n“I think Stanton has all the elements of old John Adams--able, staunch,\r\npatriotic, full of principle, and always unpopular. He lacks that sense\r\nof other people’s opinions which keeps a man from running against them.”\r\n\r\nJohn Swinton was one of the few of Dana’s men who might be described\r\nas a “character.” He lived a double intellectual life, writing\r\nconservative articles in his newspaper hours and making socialistic\r\nspeeches when he was off duty. Yet it was a double life without\r\nduplicity, for there was no concealment in it, no hypocrisy, and\r\nno harm. When he had finished his day in the office of the _Sun_,\r\nperhaps at writing some instructive paragraphs about the possibilities\r\nof American trade in Nicaragua, he would take off his skull-cap,\r\nplace a black soft hat on his gray head, and go forth to dilate on\r\nthe advantages of super-Fourierism to some sympathetic audience of\r\nsocialists.\r\n\r\nThere was a story in the office that one evening Mr. Swinton, making a\r\nspeech at a socialistic gathering, referred hotly to the editor of the\r\n_Sun_ as one of the props of a false form of government, and added that\r\n“some day two old men will come rolling down the steps of the _Sun_\r\noffice,” and that at the bottom of the steps he, Swinton, would be on\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThis may be of a piece with the story about Mr. Dana and the man with\r\nthe revolver; but the young men in the reporters’ room liked to tell\r\nit to younger men. It probably had its basis in the fact that on the\r\nmorning after a particularly ferocious assault on capital, John Swinton\r\nwould poke his head into Mr. Dana’s room to tell him how he had given\r\nhim the dickens the night before--information which tickled Mr. Dana\r\nimmensely. And Dana never went to the bottom of the _Sun_ stairs except\r\non his own sturdy legs.\r\n\r\nSwinton was a Scotsman, born in Haddingtonshire in 1830. He emigrated\r\nto Canada as a boy, learned the printer’s trade, and worked at the case\r\nin New York. After travels all over the country, he lived for a time\r\nin Charleston, South Carolina, and there acquired an abhorrence for\r\nslavery. He went to Kansas and took part in the Free Soil contest, but\r\nreturned to New York in 1857 and began the study of medicine.\r\n\r\nWhile so engaged he contributed articles to the New York _Times_, and\r\nHenry J. Raymond, who liked his work, took him as an editorial writer.\r\nHe was the managing editor of the _Times_ during the Civil War, and\r\nhad sole charge during Raymond’s absences. At the end of the war\r\nSwinton’s health caused him to resign from the managing editorship, but\r\nhe continued to write for the editorial page. He went to work on the\r\n_Sun_ about 1877.\r\n\r\nHis specialty was paragraphs. Dana liked men who could do anything, but\r\nhe also preferred that every man should have some specialty. Swinton\r\nhad the imagination and the light touch of the skilful weaver of\r\nsmall items. Also, he was much interested in Central America, and his\r\nknowledge of that region was of frequent use to the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nSwinton left the _Sun_ in 1883 to give his whole time to _John\r\nSwinton’s Paper_, a weekly journal in which he expounded his\r\nlabour-reform and other political views. He was the author of many\r\npamphlets and several books, including a “Eulogy of Henry J. Raymond”\r\nand an “Oration on John Brown.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the editorial writers of what may be called the iron age of\r\nthe _Sun_; the men who helped Dana to build the first story of a great\r\nhouse. As they passed on, younger men, some greater men, trained in the\r\nDana school, took their places and spanned the _Sun’s_ golden age--such\r\nmen as E. P. Mitchell, Francis P. Church, and Mayo W. Hazeltine.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on the other side of a partition on the third floor of the\r\nold brick building at the corner of Frankfort Street, another group of\r\nmen were doing their best to advance Dana’s _Sun_ by making it the best\r\nnewspaper as well as the best editorial paper in America. These, too,\r\nwere giants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDANA’S FIRST BIG NEWS MEN\r\n\r\n  _Amos J. Cummings, Dr. Wood, and John B. Bogart.--The Lively Days\r\n    of Tweedism.--Elihu Root as a Dramatic Critic.--The Birth and\r\n    Popularity of “The Sun’s” Cat._\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging editors did not come into favour in American newspaper offices\r\nuntil the second half of the last century. As late as 1872 Frederic\r\nHudson, in his “History of Journalism in the United States,” grumbled\r\nat the intrusion of a new functionary upon the field:\r\n\r\n    If a journal has an editor, and editor-in-chief, it is fair to\r\n    assume that he is also its managing editor.\r\n\r\nThat historian (he was a _Herald_ man, and Bennett would have no\r\nmanaging editor) had not been reconciled to the fact that between\r\nthe editor of a newspaper--the director of its policies and opinions\r\nand general style and tone--and the subeditors to whose various\r\ndesks comes the flood of news there must be some one who will act\r\nas a link, lightening the labours of the editor and shouldering the\r\nresponsibilities of the desk men. He may never write an editorial\r\narticle; may never turn out a sheet of news copy or put a head on an\r\nitem; may never make up a page or arrange an assignment list--but he\r\nmust know how to do every one of these things and a great deal more.\r\n\r\nA managing editor is really the newspaper’s manager of its employees\r\nin the news field. He is an editor to the extent that he edits men.\r\nHe may appear to spend most of his time and judgment on the acceptance\r\nor rejection of news matter, the giving of decisions as to the length\r\nor character of an article, its position in the paper, and, more\r\nbroadly, the general make-up of the next day’s product; but a man\r\nmight be able to perform all these professional functions wisely and\r\nyet be impossible as a managing editor through his inability to handle\r\nnewspapermen.\r\n\r\nThe _Tribune_ was the first New York paper to have a managing editor.\r\nHe was Dana. Serene, tactful, and a man of the world, he was able\r\nby judicious handling to keep for the _Tribune_ the services of men\r\nlike Warren and Pike, who might have been repelled by the sometimes\r\nirritable Greeley. The title came from the London _Times_, where it had\r\nbeen used for years, perhaps borrowed from the _directeur gérant_ of\r\nthe French newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ had no managing editor until Dana bought it, Beach having\r\npreferred to direct personally all matters above the ken of the city\r\neditor. The _Sun’s_ first managing editor was Isaac W. England, whom\r\nDana had known and liked when both were on the _Tribune_. England\r\nwas of Welsh blood and English birth, having been born in Twerton, a\r\nsuburb of Bath, in 1832. He worked at the bookbinding trade until he\r\nwas seventeen, and then came to the United States and made his living\r\nat bookbinding and printing. He used to tell his _Sun_ associates of\r\nhis triumphal return to England, when he was twenty, for a short visit,\r\nwhich he spent in the shop of his apprenticeship, showing his old\r\nmaster how much better the Yankees were at embossing and lettering.\r\n\r\nEngland returned to America in the steerage and saw the brutal\r\ntreatment of immigrants. This he described in several articles and\r\nsold them to the _Tribune_. Greeley gave him a job pulling a hand-press\r\nat ten dollars a week, but later made him a reporter. He was city\r\neditor of the _Tribune_ until after the Civil War, and then he went\r\nwith his friend Dana to Chicago for the short and profitless experience\r\nwith the Chicago _Republican_. In the period between Dana’s retirement\r\nfrom the _Republican_ and his purchase of the _Sun_, England was\r\nmanager of the Jersey City _Times_.\r\n\r\nEngland was managing editor of the _Sun_ only a year, then becoming\r\nits publisher--a position for which he was well fitted. An example of\r\nhis business ability was given in 1877, when Frank Leslie went into\r\nbankruptcy. England was made assignee, and he handled the affairs of\r\nthe Leslie concern so well that its debts were paid off in three years.\r\nThis was only a side job for England, who continued all the time to\r\nmanage the business matters of the _Sun_. When he died, in 1885, Dana\r\nwrote that he had “lost the friend of almost a lifetime, a man of\r\nunconquerable integrity, true and faithful in all things.”\r\n\r\nThe second managing editor of the _Sun_ was that great newspaperman\r\nAmos Jay Cummings. He was born to newspaper work if any man ever was.\r\nHis father, who was a Congregational minister--a fact which could not\r\nbe surmised by listening to Amos in one of his explosive moods--was\r\nthe editor of the _Christian Palladium and Messenger_. This staid\r\npublication was printed on the first floor of the Cummings home at\r\nIrvington, New Jersey. Entrance to the composing-room was forbidden the\r\nson, but with tears and tobacco he bribed the printer, one Sylvester\r\nBailey, who set up the Rev. Mr. Cummings’s articles, to let him in\r\nthrough a window. Cummings and Bailey later set type together on the\r\n_Tribune_. They fought in the same regiment in the Civil War. They\r\nworked together on the _Evening Sun_, and they are buried in the same\r\ncemetery at Irvington.\r\n\r\nThe trade once learned, young Amos left home and wandered from State\r\nto State, making a living at the case. In 1856, when he was only\r\nfourteen, he was attracted by the glamour that surrounded William\r\nWalker, the famous filibuster, and joined the forces of that daring\r\nyoung adventurer, who then had control of Nicaragua. The boy was one of\r\na strange horde of soldiers of fortune, which included British soldiers\r\nwho had been at Sebastopol, Italians who had followed Garibaldi, and\r\nHungarians in whom Kossuth had aroused the martial flame.\r\n\r\nLike many of the others in Walker’s army, Cummings believed that the\r\nTennessean was a second Napoleon, with Central America, perhaps South\r\nAmerica, for his empire. But when this Napoleon came to his Elba by his\r\nsurrender to Commander Davis of the United States navy, in the spring\r\nof 1857, Cummings decided that there was no marshal’s baton in his own\r\nragged knapsack and went back to be a wandering printer.\r\n\r\nCummings was setting type in the _Tribune_ office when the Civil War\r\nbegan. He hurried out and enlisted as a private in the Twenty-Sixth New\r\nJersey Volunteer Infantry. He fought at Antietam, Chancellorsville, and\r\nFredericksburg. At Marye’s Hill, in the battle of Fredericksburg, his\r\nregiment was supporting a battery against a Confederate charge. Their\r\nlines were broken and they fell back from the guns. Cummings took the\r\nregimental flag from the hands of the colour-sergeant and ran alone,\r\nunder the enemy’s fire, back to the guns. The Jerseymen rallied, the\r\nguns were recovered, and Cummings got the Medal of Honor from Congress.\r\nHe left the service as sergeant-major of the regiment and presently\r\nappeared in Greeley’s office, a seedy figure infolded in an army\r\novercoat.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Greeley,” said Amos, “I’ve just got to have work.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed!” creaked Horace. “And why have you got to have work?”\r\n\r\nCummings said nothing, but turned his back on the great editor,\r\nlifted his coat-tails and showed the sad, if not shocking, state of\r\nhis breeches. He got work. In 1863, when the _Tribune_ office was\r\nthreatened by the rioters, Amos helped to barricade the composing-room\r\nand save it from the mob.\r\n\r\nCummings served as editor of the _Weekly Tribune_ and as a political\r\nwriter for the daily. This is the way he came to quit the _Tribune_:\r\n\r\nJohn Russell Young, the third managing editor of the _Tribune_, got\r\nthe habit of issuing numbered orders. Two of these orders reached\r\nCummings’s desk, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Order No. 756--There is too much profanity in this office.\r\n\r\n    Order No. 757--Hereafter the political reporter must have his\r\n    copy in at 10.30 P.M.\r\n\r\nCummings turned to his desk and wrote:\r\n\r\n    Order No. 1234567--Everybody knows ---- well that I get most of\r\n    the political news out of the Albany _Journal_, and everybody\r\n    knows ---- ---- well that the _Journal_ doesn’t get here until\r\n    eleven o’clock at night, and anybody who knows anything knows\r\n    ---- ---- well that asking me to get my stuff up at half past\r\n    ten is like asking a man to sit on a window-sill and dance on\r\n    the roof at the same time.\r\n\r\n                                        CUMMINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result of this multiplicity of numbered orders was that shortly\r\nafterward Cummings presented himself to the editor of the _Sun_.\r\n\r\n“Why are you leaving the _Tribune_?” asked Mr. Dana.\r\n\r\n“They say,” replied Amos, “that I swear too much.”\r\n\r\n“Just the man for me!” replied Dana, according to the version which\r\nCummings used to tell.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, Amos went on the _Sun_ as managing editor, and he\r\ncontinued to swear. The compositors now in the _Sun_ office who\r\nremember him at all remember him largely for that.\r\n\r\nThe union once set apart a day for contributions to the printers’-home\r\nfund, and each compositor was to contribute the fruits of a thousand\r\nems of composition. Cummings, who was proud of being a union printer,\r\nleft his managing-editor’s desk and went to the composing-room.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Mr. Cummings,” said Abe Masters, the foreman, “I’ll give you some\r\nof your own copy to set.”\r\n\r\n“To hell with my own copy!” said Cummings, who knew his handwriting\r\nfaults. “Give me some reprint.”\r\n\r\nGreen reporters got a taste of the Cummings profanity. One of them put\r\na French phrase in a story. Cummings asked him what it meant, and the\r\nyouth told him.\r\n\r\n“Then why the hell didn’t you write it that way?” yelled Cummings.\r\n“This paper is for people who read English!”\r\n\r\nIn those days murderers were executed in the old Tombs prison in Centre\r\nStreet. Cummings, who was full of enterprise, sought a way to get\r\nquickly the fall of the drop. The telephone had not been perfected,\r\nbut there was a shot-tower north of the _Sun’s_ office and east of the\r\nTombs. Cummings sent one man to the Tombs, with instructions to wave a\r\nflag upon the instant of the execution. Another man, stationed at the\r\ntop of the shot-tower, had another flag, with which he was to make a\r\nsign to Cummings on the roof of the Sun Building, as soon as he saw the\r\nflag move at the prison.\r\n\r\nThe reporter at the Tombs arranged with a keeper to notify him just\r\nbefore the execution, but the keeper was sent on an errand, and\r\npresently Cummings, standing nervously on the roof of the Sun Building,\r\nheard the newsboys crying the extras of a rival sheet. The plan had\r\nfallen through. No blanks could adequately represent the Cummings\r\ntemper upon that occasion.\r\n\r\nCummings was probably the best all-round news man of his day. He\r\nhad the executive ability and the knowledge of men that make a good\r\nmanaging editor. He knew what Dana knew--that the newspapers had yet to\r\ntouch public sympathy and imagination in the news columns as well as in\r\neditorial articles; and he knew how to do it, how to teach men to do\r\nit, how to cram the moving picture of a living city into the four pages\r\nof the _Sun_. He advised desk men, complimented or corrected reporters,\r\nedited local articles, and, when a story appealed to him strongly, he\r\nwent out and got it and wrote it himself.\r\n\r\nIn such brief biographies of Cummings as have been printed you will\r\nfind that he is best remembered in the outer world as a managing\r\neditor, or as the editor of the _Evening Sun_, or as a Representative\r\nin Congress fighting for the rights of Civil War veterans, printers’\r\nunions, and letter-carriers; but among the oldest generation of\r\nnewspapermen he is revered as a great reporter. He was the first real\r\nhuman-interest reporter. He knew the news value of the steer loose in\r\nthe streets, the lost child in the police station, the Italian murder\r\nthat was really a case of vendetta. The _Sun_ men of his time followed\r\nhis lead, and a few of them, like Julian Ralph, outdid him, but he was\r\nthe pioneer; and a thousand _Sun_ men since then have kept, or tried\r\nto keep, on the Cummings trail.\r\n\r\nIt was Cummings who sent men to cover the police stations at night and\r\nmade it possible for the _Sun_ to beat the news association on the\r\ntrivial items which were the delight of the reader, and which helped,\r\namong other things, to shoot the paper’s daily circulation to one\r\nhundred thousand in the third year of the Dana ownership.\r\n\r\nThe years when Cummings was managing editor of the _Sun_ were years\r\nstuffed with news. Even a newspaperman without imagination would have\r\nfound plenty of happenings at hand. The Franco-Prussian War, the gold\r\nconspiracy that ended in Black Friday (September 24, 1869), the Orange\r\nriot (July 12, 1871), the great Chicago fire, the killing of Fisk by\r\nStokes, Tweedism--what more could a newspaperman wish in so brief a\r\nperiod? And, of course, always there were murders. There were so many\r\nmysterious murders in the _Sun_ that a suspicious person might have\r\nharboured the thought that Cummings went out after his day’s work was\r\ndone and committed them for art’s sake.\r\n\r\nWhen men and women stopped killing, Cummings would turn to politics.\r\nTweed was the great man then; under suspicion, even before 1870, but a\r\ngreat man, particularly among his own. The _Sun_ printed pages about\r\nTweed and his satellites and the great balls of the Americus Club,\r\ntheir politico-social organisation. It described the jewels worn by\r\nthe leaders of Tammany Hall, including the two-thousand-dollar club\r\nbadge--the head of a tiger with eyes of ruby and three large diamonds\r\nshining above them.\r\n\r\nEverybody who wanted the political news read the _Sun_. As Jim Fisk\r\nremarked one evening as he stood proudly with Jay Gould in the lobby\r\nof the Grand Opera House--proud of his notoriety in connection with\r\nthe Erie Railroad jobbery, proud of the infamy he enjoyed from the fact\r\nthat he owned two houses in the same block in West Twenty-third Street,\r\nhousing his wife in one and Josie Mansfield in the other; proud of his\r\nguilty partnership in Tweedism--\r\n\r\n    “The _Sun’s_ a lively paper. I can never wait for daylight for\r\n    a copy. I have my man down there with a horse every morning,\r\n    and just as soon as he gets a _Sun_ hot from the press he jumps\r\n    on the back of that horse and puts for me as if all hell was\r\n    after him.\r\n\r\n    “Gould’s the same way; he has to see it before daylight, too.\r\n    My man has to bring him up a copy. You always get the news\r\n    ahead of everybody else. Why, the first news I got that Gould\r\n    and me were blackballed in the Blossom Club we got from the\r\n    _Sun_. I’m damned if I’d believe it at first, and Gould says,\r\n    ‘What is this Blossom Club?’ Just then Sweeny came in. I asked\r\n    Sweeny if it was true, and Sweeny said yes, that Tweed was the\r\n    man that done it all. There it was in the _Sun_, straight’s a\r\n    die.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ reporter who chronicled this--it may have been Cummings\r\nhimself--had gone to ask Fisk whether he and his friends had hired a\r\nthug to black-jack the respectable Mr. Dorman B. Eaton, a foe of the\r\nErie outfit; but he took down and printed Fisk’s tribute to the _Sun’s_\r\nenterprise. As there was scarcely a morning in those days when the\r\n_Sun_ did not turn up some new trick played by the Tweed gang and the\r\nErie group, their anxiety to get an early copy was natural.\r\n\r\nTweed and his philanthropic pretences did not deceive the _Sun_. On\r\nFebruary 24, 1870--a year and a half before the exposure which sent\r\nthe boss to prison--the _Sun_ printed an editorial article announcing\r\nthat Tweed was willing to surrender his ownership of the city upon the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  (_From a Photograph by Paul Dana_)\r\n\r\n    MR. DANA AT SEVENTY\r\n]\r\n\r\n    To give up all interest in the court-house swindle.\r\n\r\n    To receive no more revenue from the department of survey and\r\n    inspection of buildings; and he hopes the people of New York\r\n    will remember his generosity in giving up this place, inasmuch\r\n    as his share amounts to over one hundred thousand dollars a\r\n    year.\r\n\r\nTweed was liked by many New Yorkers, particularly those who knew him\r\nonly by his lavish charities. One of these wrote the following letter,\r\nwhich the _Sun_ printed on December 7, 1870, under the heading “A\r\nMonument to Boss Tweed--the Money Paid In”:\r\n\r\n    Enclosed please find ten cents as a contribution to erect a\r\n    statue to William M. Tweed on Tweed Plaza. I have no doubt that\r\n    fifty thousand to seventy-five thousand of his admirers will\r\n    contribute. Yours, etc.,\r\n\r\n                                        SEVENTEENTH WARD VOTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn December 12 the _Sun_ said editorially:\r\n\r\n    Has Boss Tweed any friends? If he has, they are a mean set.\r\n    It is now more than a week since an appeal was made to them\r\n    to come forward and put up the ancillary qualities to erect a\r\n    statue of Mr. Tweed in the centre of Tweed Plaza; but as yet\r\n    only four citizens have sent in their subscriptions. These were\r\n    not large, but they were paid in cash, and there is reason for\r\n    the belief that they were the tokens of sincere admiration\r\n    for Mr. Tweed. But the hundreds, or, rather, thousands, of\r\n    small-potato politicians whom he has made rich and powerful\r\n    stand aloof and do not offer a picayune.\r\n\r\n    We propose that the statue shall be executed by Captain\r\n    Albertus de Groot, who made the celebrated Vanderbilt bronzes,\r\n    but we have not yet decided whether it shall represent the\r\n    favorite son of New York afoot or ahorseback. In fact, we\r\n    rather incline to have a nautical statue, exhibiting Boss Tweed\r\n    as a bold mariner, amid the wild fury of a hurricane, splicing\r\n    the main brace in the foretopgallant futtock shrouds of his\r\n    steam-yacht. But that is a matter for future consideration. The\r\n    first thing is to get the money; and if those who claim to be\r\n    Mr. Tweed’s friends don’t raise it, we shall begin to believe\r\n    the rumor that the Hon. P. Brains Sweeny has turned against\r\n    him, and has forbidden every one to give anything toward the\r\n    erection of the projected statue.\r\n\r\nTen days later the _Sun_ carried on the editorial page a long news\r\nstory headed “Our Statue of Boss Tweed--the Readers of the _Sun_\r\nGoing to Work in Dead Earnest--The _Sun’s_ Advice Followed, Ha!\r\nHa!--Organisation of the Tweed Testimonial Association of the City of\r\nNew York--A Bronze Statue Worth Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars to Be\r\nErected.”\r\n\r\nSure enough, the ward politicians had taken the joke seriously. Police\r\nJustice Edward J. Shandley, Tim Campbell, Coroner Patrick Keenan,\r\nPolice Commissioner Smith, and a dozen other faithful Tammany men were\r\non the list of trustees. They decided upon the space then known as\r\nTweed Plaza, at the junction of East Broadway and New Canal and Rutgers\r\nStreets as the site for the monument.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ added to the joke by printing more letters from contributors.\r\nOne, from Patrick Maloy, “champion eel-bobber,” brought ten cents and\r\nthe suggestion that the statue should be inscribed with the amount of\r\nmoney that Tweed had made out of the city. This sort of thing went\r\non into the new year, the _Sun_ aggravating the movement with grave\r\neditorial advice.\r\n\r\nAt last the jest became more than Tweed could bear, and from his\r\ndesk in the Senate Chamber at Albany, on March 13, 1871, he sent\r\nthe following letter to Judge Shandley, the chairman of the statue\r\ncommittee:\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    I learn that a movement to erect a statue to me in the city of\r\n    New York is being seriously pushed by a committee of citizens\r\n    of which you are chairman.\r\n\r\n    I was aware that a newspaper of our city had brought forward\r\n    the proposition, but I considered it one of the jocose\r\n    sensations for which that journal is so famous. Since I left\r\n    the city to engage in legislation the proposition appears to\r\n    have been taken up by my friends, no doubt in resentment at the\r\n    supposed unfriendly motive of the original proposition and the\r\n    manner in which it had been urged.\r\n\r\n    The only effect of the proposed statue is to present me\r\n    to the public as assenting to the parade of a public and\r\n    permanent testimonial to vanity and self-glorification which\r\n    do not exist. You will thus perceive that the movement, which\r\n    originated in a joke, but which you have made serious, is doing\r\n    me an injustice and an injury; and I beg of you to see to it\r\n    that it is at once stopped.\r\n\r\n    I hardly know which is the more absurd--the original\r\n    proposition or the grave comments of others, based upon the\r\n    idea that I have given the movement countenance. I have been\r\n    about as much abused as any man in public life; I can stand\r\n    abuse and bear even more than my share; but I have never yet\r\n    been charged with being deficient in common sense.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours very truly,\r\n                                                    WM. M. TWEED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter appeared in the _Sun_ the next day under the facetious\r\nheading: “A Great Man’s Modesty--The Most Remarkable Letter Ever\r\nWritten by the Noble Benefactor of the People.” Editorial regret\r\nwas expressed at Tweed’s declination; and, still in solemn mockery,\r\nthe _Sun_ grieved over the return to the subscribers of the several\r\nthousand dollars that had been sent to Shandley’s committee. William J.\r\nFlorence, the comedian, had put himself down for five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nWas it utterly absurd that the Tweed idolaters should have taken\r\nseriously the _Sun’s_ little joke? No, for so serious a writer as\r\nGustavus Myers wrote in his “History of Tammany Hall” (1901) that “one\r\nof the signers of the circular has assured the author that it was a\r\nserious proposal. The attitude of the _Sun_ confirms this.” And another\r\ngrave literary man, Dr. Henry Van Dyke, set this down in his “Essays on\r\nApplication” (1908):\r\n\r\n    William M. Tweed, of New York, who reigned over the city for\r\n    seven years, stole six million dollars or more for himself and\r\n    six million dollars or more for his followers; was indorsed at\r\n    the heights of his corruption by six of the richest citizens of\r\n    the metropolis; had a public statue offered to him by the New\r\n    York _Sun_ as a “noble benefactor of the city,” etc.\r\n\r\nOf course Mr. Myers and Dr. Van Dyke had never read the statue articles\r\nfrom beginning to end, else they would not have stumbled over the brick\r\nthat even Tweed, with all his conceit, was able to perceive.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1871, when the New York _Times_ was fortunate enough to have\r\nput in its hands the proof of what everybody already suspected--that\r\nSenator Tweed, Comptroller Connolly, Park Commissioner Sweeny, and\r\ntheir associates were plundering the city--the _Sun_ was busy with\r\nits own pet news and political articles, the investigation of the\r\nOrange riots and the extravagance and nepotism of President Grant’s\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ did not like the _Times_, which had been directed, since\r\nthe death of Henry J. Raymond, in 1869, by Raymond’s partner, George\r\nJones, and Raymond’s chief editorial writer, Louis J. Jennings; but\r\nthe _Sun_ liked the Tweed gang still less. It had been pounding at it\r\nfor two years, using the head-lines “Boss Tweed’s Legislature,” or\r\n“Mr. Sweeny’s Legislature,” every day of the sessions at the State\r\ncapital; but neither the _Sun_ nor any other newspaper had been able to\r\nobtain the figures that proved the robbery until the county bookkeeper,\r\nMatthew J. O’Rourke, dug them out and took them to the _Times_.\r\n\r\nThe books showed that the city had been gouged out of five million\r\ndollars in one item alone--the price paid in two years to a Tweed\r\ncontracting firm, Ingersoll & Co., for furniture and carpets for the\r\ncounty court-house. Enough carpets had been bought--or at least paid\r\nfor--to cover the eight acres of City Hall Park three layers deep. And\r\nthat five million dollars was only a fraction of the loot.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1871, after the mass-meeting of citizens in Cooper Union,\r\nthe _Sun_ began printing the revelations of Tweedism under the standing\r\nhead, “The Doom of the Ring.”\r\n\r\nTweed engaged as counsel, among others, William O. Bartlett, who was\r\nnot only counsel for the _Sun_ but, next to Mr. Dana, the paper’s\r\nleading editorial writer at that time. The boss may have fancied that\r\nin retaining Bartlett he retained the _Sun_, but it is more likely that\r\nhe sought Bartlett’s services because of that lawyer’s reputation as\r\nan aggressive and able counsellor. If Tweed had any delusions about\r\ninfluencing the _Sun_, they were quickly dispelled. On September 18, in\r\nan editorial article probably written by Dana, the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    While Mr. Bartlett, in his able argument before Judge Barnard\r\n    on Friday, vindicated Mr. Tweed from certain allegations set\r\n    forth in the complaint of Mr. Foley, he by no means relieved\r\n    him from all complicity in the enormous frauds and robberies\r\n    that have been committed in the government of this city. With\r\n    all his ability, that is something beyond Mr. Bartlett’s\r\n    power; and it is vain to hope that either of the leaders of\r\n    the Tammany Ring can ever regain the confidence of the public,\r\n    or for any length of time exercise the authority of political\r\n    office. They must all go, Sweeny, Tweed, and Hall, as well as\r\n    Connolly.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Tweed must not imagine that he can buy his way out of\r\n    the present complication with money, as he did in 1870. The\r\n    next Legislature will be made up of different material from\r\n    the Republicans he purchased, and the people will exercise a\r\n    sterner supervision over its acts.\r\n\r\nA good picture of Tweed’s popularity, which he still retained among his\r\nown people, was drawn in an editorial article in the _Sun_ of October\r\n30, 1871, three days after the boss had been arrested and released in a\r\nmillion dollars’ bail:\r\n\r\n    In the Fourth District William M. Tweed is sure to be\r\n    re-elected [to the State Senate]. The Republican factions,\r\n    after a great deal of quarreling, have concentrated on\r\n    O’Donovan Rossa, a well-known Fenian, but his chance is\r\n    nothing. Even if it had been possible by beginning in season to\r\n    defeat Tweed, it cannot be done with only a week’s time.\r\n\r\n    Besides, his power there is absolute. The district comprises\r\n    the most ignorant and most vicious portion of the city.\r\n    It is full of low grog-shops, houses of ill-fame, low\r\n    gambling-houses, and sailor boarding-houses, whose keepers\r\n    enjoy protection and immunity, for which they pay by the most\r\n    efficient electioneering services. Moreover, the district is\r\n    full of sinecures paid from the city treasury. If, instead\r\n    of having stolen millions, Mr. Tweed were accused of a dozen\r\n    murders, or if, instead of being in human form, he wore the\r\n    semblance of a bull or a bear, the voters of the Fourth\r\n    District would march to the polls and vote for him just as\r\n    zealously as they will do now, and the inspectors of election\r\n    would furnish for him by fraudulent counting any majority that\r\n    might be thought necessary in addition to the votes really\r\n    given.\r\n\r\nTweed was re-elected to the State Senate by twelve thousand plurality.\r\n\r\nThe great robber-boss was a source of news from his rise in the late\r\nsixties to his death in 1878. As early as March, 1870, the _Sun_ gave\r\nits readers an intimate idea of Tweed’s private extravagances under\r\nthe heading: “Bill Tweed’s Big Barn--Democratic Extravagance Versus\r\nThat of the White House--Grant’s Billiard Saloon, Caligula’s Stable,\r\nand Leonard Jerome’s Private Theatre Eclipsed--Martin Van Buren’s Gold\r\nSpoons Nowhere--Belmont’s Four-in-Hand Overshadowed--a Picture for\r\nRural Democrats.”\r\n\r\nBeneath this head was a column story beginning:\r\n\r\n    The Hon. William M. Tweed resides at 41 West Thirty-sixth\r\n    Street. The Hon. William M. Tweed’s horses reside in East\r\n    Fortieth Street, between Madison and Park Avenues.\r\n\r\nThat was the _Sun’s_ characteristic way of starting a story.\r\n\r\nTweed was, in a way, responsible for the appearance of a _Sun_ more\r\nthan four pages in size. Up to December, 1875, there was no issue of\r\nthe _Sun_ on Sundays. In November of that year it was announced that\r\nbeginning on December 5 there would be a Sunday _Sun_, to be sold at\r\nthree cents, one cent more than the week-day price, but nothing was\r\nsaid, or thought, of an increase In size.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, December 4, Tweed, with the connivance of his keepers,\r\nescaped from his house in Madison Avenue. This made a four-column story\r\non which Mr. Dana had not counted. Also, the advertisers had taken\r\nadvantage of the new Sunday issue, and there were more than two pages\r\nof advertisements. There was nothing for it but to make an eight-page\r\npaper, for which Dana, who then believed that all the news could be\r\ntold in a folio, apologised as follows:\r\n\r\n    We confess ourselves surprised at the extraordinary pressure of\r\n    advertisements upon our pages this morning; and disappointed\r\n    in being compelled to present the _Sun_ to our readers in a\r\n    different form from that to which they are accustomed. We\r\n    trust, however, that they will find it no less interesting\r\n    than usual; and, still more, that they will feel that although\r\n    the appearance may be somewhat different, it is yet the same\r\n    friendly and faithful _Sun_.\r\n\r\nBut the Sunday issue of the _Sun_ never went back to four pages, for\r\nthe eight-page paper had been made so attractive with special stories,\r\nreprint, and short fiction that both readers and advertisers were\r\npleased. It was ten years, however, before the week-day _Sun_ increased\r\nits size. Even during the Beecher trial (January, 1875) when the\r\n_Sun’s_ reporter, Franklin Fyles, found himself unable to condense the\r\nday’s proceedings within a page of seven columns, the _Sun_ still gave\r\nall the rest of the day’s news.\r\n\r\nCummings’s right-hand man in the news department of the _Sun_ was Dr.\r\nJohn B. Wood, the Great American Condenser. All the city copy passed\r\nthrough his hands. He was then nearing fifty, a white-haired man who\r\nwore two pairs of glasses with thick lenses, these crowned with a green\r\nshade. He had been a printer on several papers and a desk man on the\r\n_Tribune_, whence Dana brought him to the _Sun_. Wood’s sense of the\r\nvalue of words was so acute that he could determine, as rapidly as his\r\neye passed along the pages of a story, just what might be stricken out\r\nwithout loss. It might be a word, a sentence, a page; sometimes it\r\nwould be ninety-eight per cent of the article.\r\n\r\nEven when his sight so failed that he was unable to read copy\r\ncontinuously, Dr. Wood performed the remarkable feat of condensing\r\nthrough a reader. Willis Holly read copy to him for months, six hours\r\na night. Holly might read three pages without interruption, while Wood\r\nsat as silent as if he were asleep. Then----\r\n\r\n“Throw out the introduction down to the middle of the second page,\r\nbegin with ‘John Elliott killed,’ and cut it off at ‘arrested him.’”\r\n\r\nJoseph C. Hendrix, who became a member of Congress and a bank\r\npresident, was a _Sun_ cub reporter. One night he was assigned to read\r\ncopy to Dr. Wood. He picked up a sheet and began:\r\n\r\n“‘The application of Mrs. Jane Smith for divorce from her husband, John\r\nSmith--’”\r\n\r\n“Cut out ‘her husband,’” said Wood.\r\n\r\n“‘--who alleges cruelty,’” Hendrix continued, “‘in that he--’” Here the\r\nreporter’s writing was blurred, and Hendrix, who could not decipher it,\r\nsaid “Damn!”\r\n\r\n“Cut out the ‘damn,’” said Dr. Wood.\r\n\r\nIn keeping news down to the bone Wood was of remarkable value to the\r\n_Sun_ in those years when Dana showed that it was possible to tell\r\neverything in four pages. New York was smaller then, and display\r\nadvertising had not come to be a science. The _Sun_ got along nicely on\r\nits circulation, for the newsdealers paid one and one-third cents for\r\neach copy. With the circulation receipts about fourteen hundred dollars\r\na day, the advertising receipts were clear profit. Amos Cummings had\r\nsuch a fierce disregard for the feelings of advertisers that often,\r\nwhen a good piece of news came in late, he would throw out advertising\r\nto make room for it.\r\n\r\nThe city editors of the _Sun_ under Cummings were, in order, John\r\nWilliams, Lawrence S. Kane, Walter M. Rosebault, William Young, and\r\nJohn B. Bogart. Williams, who had been a Methodist preacher, left the\r\n_Sun_ in 1869 to become religious editor of the _Herald_. Kane, a big\r\nblond Irishman with mutton-chop whiskers, held the city desk until the\r\nsummer of 1870 and then returned to the reportorial staff. Rosebault,\r\nwho had been one of the _Sun’s_ best young reporters, resigned from the\r\ncity editorship late in 1870 in order to study law. He afterward went\r\nto San Francisco to be principal editorial writer of the _Chronicle_,\r\nbut soon returned to New York and for many years, while practising\r\nlaw, he contributed editorial and special articles to the _Sun_. Mr.\r\nRosebault, who is still an active lawyer, told the present writer, in\r\nJuly, 1918, that of all the reporters who served on his staff when\r\nhe was city editor of the _Sun_ only one, Sidney Rosenfeld, later a\r\ndramatist and the first editor of _Puck_, was still alive.\r\n\r\nThe first telegraph editor of the _Sun_ was an Episcopalian clergyman,\r\nArthur Beckwith, afterward connected with the Brooklyn _Eagle_ and the\r\nBrooklyn _Citizen_ as a law reporter. When he left the telegraph desk\r\nof the _Sun_ his place was taken by Colonel Henry Grenville Shaw, a\r\nCivil War veteran. Colonel Shaw left the _Sun_ to become night editor\r\nof the San Francisco _Chronicle_ and was succeeded by Amos B. Stillman,\r\na ninety-pound man from Connecticut. He was a newspaperman in his\r\nnative state until the Civil War, and after Appomattox he went back\r\nto Connecticut. He went on the _Sun_ in 1870 as telegraph editor, and\r\nstayed on the same desk for forty-five years.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of Dana’s _Sun_ there were no night editors, for\r\nit had not been found necessary to establish a central desk where\r\nall the news of all the departments could be gathered together for\r\njudgment as to relative value. Each desk man sent his own copy to the\r\ncomposing-room, and the pages were made up by the managing editor or\r\nthe night city editor after midnight. Leisurely nights, those, with\r\nno newspaper trains to catch and no starting of the presses until four\r\no’clock in the morning!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    AMOS JAY CUMMINGS\r\n]\r\n\r\nOne evening in that period the other desk men in the news department of\r\nthe _Sun_ observed that Amos Stillman was extraordinarily busy and more\r\nthan usually silent. He scribbled away, revising despatches and writing\r\nsubheads, and it was after twelve o’clock when he got up, stretched,\r\nand uttered one sentence:\r\n\r\n“Quite a fire in Chicago!”\r\n\r\nThat was the October evening in 1871 when Mrs. O’Leary’s cow started\r\nthe blaze that consumed seventeen thousand buildings. To Deacon\r\nStillman it was just a busy night.\r\n\r\nDeacon Stillman was born only eighteen months after the _Sun_--Ben\r\nDay’s _Sun_; but even as this is being written he is strolling up and\r\ndown a corridor in the _Sun_ office, waiting for another old-timer,\r\nsome mere lad of sixty, to come out and have dinner with him.\r\n\r\nUnder Cummings was developed a young man who turned out to be one of\r\nthe great city editors of New York--John B. Bogart, of whom Arthur\r\nBrisbane wrote that he was the best teacher of journalism that America\r\nhad produced. He was in most respects the opposite of Cummings. He had\r\nall of Cummings’s love for the business, but not his tremendous rush.\r\nCummings was an explosion, Bogart a steady flame. Cummings roared,\r\nBogart was gentle.\r\n\r\nLike Cummings and Stillman, Bogart was a Union veteran. In 1861, when\r\nhe was only sixteen years old, he left the New Haven store where\r\nhe was a clerk and enlisted in the Seventh Connecticut Volunteers.\r\nAfter serving three years in the army, he returned home to become a\r\nbookkeeper in a dry-goods store. He went on the _Sun_ February 21,\r\n1871, as a general reporter. On March 17, 1873--his twenty-eighth\r\nbirthday--he was made city editor, the former city editor, William\r\nYoung, having been promoted to the managing editor’s desk to take the\r\nplace of Cummings, whose health was poor.\r\n\r\nJohn Bogart remained at the city desk for seventeen years of tireless\r\nwork. He was a master of journalistic detail, a patient follower-up of\r\nthe stories which, like periscopes, appear and reappear on the sea of\r\nevents.\r\n\r\n“He was a whole school of journalism in himself,” Brisbane wrote of\r\nBogart years afterward. “He could tell the young men where to go for\r\ntheir news, what questions to ask, what was and what was not worth\r\nwhile. Above all, he could give enthusiasm to his men. He worked by\r\nencouraging, not by harsh criticism.”\r\n\r\nBogart always asked a young reporter whether he had read the _Sun_ that\r\nmorning. If one confessed that he had read only part of it, Bogart\r\nwould invite him to sit down, and would say:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Jones, it is one of the salutary customs of this paper that every\r\nreporter shall read everything in it before appearing for duty. Don’t\r\neven skip the advertisements, because there are stories concealed in\r\nmany of them. The _Sun_ is good breakfast-food.”\r\n\r\nThe custom of Bogart’s time is the custom still, but a reporter has to\r\ngo harder at his reading than he did in the days of the four-page _Sun_.\r\n\r\nIf a new reporter had not absorbed the _Sun_ style, Bogart gently tried\r\nto saturate him with it.\r\n\r\n“I notice,” he said to a man who had covered a little fire the night\r\nbefore, “that you begin your story with ‘at an early hour yesterday\r\nmorning,’ and that you say also that ‘smoke was seen issuing from an\r\nupper window.’”\r\n\r\n“Isn’t that good English?” asked the young man.\r\n\r\n“It is excellent English,” Bogart replied calmly, “and it has been\r\nindorsed by generations of reporters and copy-readers. If you look in\r\nthe other papers you will find that some of them also discovered smoke\r\nissuing from an upper window at an early hour yesterday morning. We do\r\nnot deny that it is good English; but it is not good _Sun_ English.”\r\n\r\nNever again did smoke issue from an upper window of that reporter’s\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nUnder Cummings and Bogart the _Sun_ turned out _Sun_ men. A young\r\nman from Troy, Franklin Fyles, was one of their first police-station\r\nreporters. He did not know as many policemen as did Joseph Josephs,\r\nwho wore a silk hat and a gambler’s mustache, and who covered the West\r\nSide stations, but he wrote well. He did not know as many desperate\r\ncharacters as were honoured with the acquaintance of David Davids, the\r\nEast Side police reporter, but he knew a _Sun_ story when he saw it.\r\nIn 1875, five years after Fyles came on the _Sun_, he was the star\r\nreporter, and he reported the Beecher trial. Ten thousand words a\r\nday in longhand was an easy day’s work for the reports of that great\r\nscandal. Fyles became the dramatic critic of the _Sun_ in 1885, and\r\ncontinued as such until 1903. In that period he wrote several plays,\r\nincluding “The Girl I Left Behind Me,” in which David Belasco was his\r\ncollaborator; “Cumberland ’61,” and “The Governor of Kentucky.” Fyles\r\ndied in 1911 at the age of 64.\r\n\r\nAnother police-station reporter of the _Sun_ was Edward Payson Weston,\r\nwho had been an office-boy in various newspaper offices until about\r\nthe beginning of the Civil War and had then become a reporter. Before\r\nDana bought the _Sun_ Weston had walked from Portland, Maine, to\r\nChicago--thirteen hundred and twenty-six miles--in twenty-six days.\r\nForty years later he walked it in twenty-five days.\r\n\r\nCummings liked Weston. Whatever faults there may have been in his\r\nliterary style, his knee action was a perfect poem. He could bring a\r\nstory down from the Bellevue morgue faster than all the horse-cars. He\r\nwas the best “leg man” in the history of journalism. In 1910, more than\r\nfour decades after the _Sun_ first took him on, Weston, then a man of\r\nseventy years, walked from Los Angeles to New York in seventy-seven\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHenry Mann, a Civil War veteran, was the _Sun’s_ principal court\r\nreporter. He covered the Tweed and Stokes trials and the impeachment of\r\nJudge Barnard. Later he was exchange editor and he is remembered also\r\nas the author of “The History of Ancient and Medieval Republics.”\r\n\r\nOther _Sun_ reporters were Tom Cook, who came from California, had\r\nthe shiniest silk hat on Park Row, and knew Fisk and the rest of the\r\nErie crowd; Big Jim Connolly, one of the best news writers of his day;\r\nthe McAlpin brothers, Robert and Tod; and Chester S. Lord, who was to\r\nbecome the managing editor of the _Sun_ and serve it in that capacity\r\nfor a third of a century.\r\n\r\nWilliam Young, who was city editor when Lord went on the paper, gave\r\nhim his first assignment--to get a story about the effect of the\r\nWhisky Ring’s work on the liquor trade. Lord wrote a light and airy\r\npiece which indicated that the ring’s operations would bring highly\r\nmoral results by decreasing the supply of intoxicants; but when the\r\ncopy-reader got through with the story this is the way it read:\r\n\r\n    A _Sun_ reporter interviewed several leading wholesale\r\n    liquor-dealers yesterday concerning the despatch from\r\n    Louisville, saying that all the old whisky in the country had\r\n    been purchased by a Western firm for a rise. They said that\r\n    they had sold their accumulated stock of prime whisky months\r\n    ago. One firm, the largest in the city, had sold nearly two\r\n    thousand barrels, stored since 1858. One shrewd dealer said it\r\n    was reported that Grant was in the ring, and that he wanted to\r\n    secure a supply to fall back on in his retirement.\r\n\r\nMark Maguire, the celebrated “Toppy,” was the chief of the sporting\r\nwriters. He was about the oldest man in the _Sun_ office, born before\r\nNapoleon went to Elba. He was the first king of the New York newsboys,\r\nand Barney Williams, the boy who first sold Ben Day’s _Sun_, once\r\nworked for him.\r\n\r\nMaguire had as customers, when they visited New York, Jackson, Webster,\r\nClay, and Calhoun. When prosperity came to him he opened road-houses\r\nthat were the resorts of horse-owners like Commodore Vanderbilt and\r\nRobert Bonner. His Cayuga House, at McComb’s Dam, was named after his\r\nown fast trotter, Cayuga Girl. Maguire’s intimacy with Bonner was such\r\nthat the hangers-on in the racing game believed that Bonner owned the\r\n_Sun_ and transmitted his views to Dana through “Toppy.” Maguire worked\r\nfor the _Sun_ up to his death in 1889.\r\n\r\nWhen Amos Cummings had an evening to spare from his regular news work\r\nhe would go with Maguire to a prize-fight and write the story of it.\r\nMaguire invented the chart by which a complete record of the blows\r\nstruck in a boxing match is kept--one circle for the head and one\r\nfor the body of each contestant, with a pencil-mark for every blow\r\nlanded. After an evening in which Jem Mace was one of the entertainers,\r\nMaguire’s chart looked like a shotgun target, but Cummings, who watched\r\nthe fighters while Mark tallied the blows, would make a live story from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ of that day had women reporters; indeed, it had the first\r\nreal woman reporter in American journalism, Mrs. Emily Verdery Battey.\r\nShe worked on fashion stories, women’s-rights stories, and general-news\r\nstories. She was one of the Georgia Verderys, and she went on the _Sun_\r\nshortly after Mr. Dana took hold. Her brother, George Verdery, was\r\nalso a _Sun_ reporter. Another _Sun_ woman of that time was Miss Anna\r\nBallard, who wrote, among other things, the news stories that bobbed up\r\nin the surrogates’ court.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic criticisms of the _Sun_, in the first three or four years\r\nof the seventies, were written by two young lawyers recently graduated\r\nfrom the law school of New York University, Willard Bartlett and Elihu\r\nRoot. Bartlett was a year the younger, but he ranked Root as a critic\r\nbecause of his acquaintance--through his father, W. O. Bartlett--with\r\nnewspaper ways. If Lester Wallack was putting on “Ours,” that would be\r\nMr. Bartlett’s assignment, while Mr. Root went to report the advance\r\nof art at Woods’s Museum, where was the Lydia Thompson troupe. If it\r\nbefell that on the same evening Edwin Booth produced “Hamlet” in a new\r\nsetting and George L. Fox appeared in a more glorious than ever “Humpty\r\nDumpty,” Critic Bartlett would see Booth; Assistant Critic Root, Fox.\r\n\r\nIn time these young journalists passed on to be actors in that more\r\ncomplex and perhaps equally interesting drama, the law, which for\r\nfourteen years they practised together. Mr. Bartlett figured as one of\r\nMr. Dana’s counsel in several of the _Sun’s_ legal cases. After thirty\r\nyears on the bench, retiring from the chief judgeship of the Court of\r\nAppeals of the State of New York through the age statute in 1916, Judge\r\nBartlett is still actively interested in the _Sun_, and many of its\r\narticles on legal and literary topics are contributed by him.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Root, his friendship with the _Sun_ has been unbroken for\r\nalmost fifty years, and he has made more news for it than most men.\r\nUnder such circumstances even the most jealous newspaper is willing to\r\nforgive the desertion of an assistant dramatic critic.\r\n\r\nIt was Willard Bartlett, incidentally, who was the inventor of the\r\n_Sun’s_ celebrated office cat. One night in the eighties the copy of\r\na message from President Cleveland to Congress came to the desk of\r\nthe telegraph editor. It was a warm evening, and the window near the\r\ntelegraph desk was open. The message fluttered out and was lost in\r\nNassau Street. The _Sun_ had nothing about it the next morning, and in\r\nthe afternoon, when Mr. Bartlett called on Mr. Dana, the matter of the\r\nlost message was under discussion. The editor remarked that it was a\r\nmatter difficult to explain to the readers.\r\n\r\n“Oh, say that the office cat ate it up,” suggested Bartlett.\r\n\r\nDana chuckled and dictated a paragraph creating the cat. Instantly the\r\nanimal became famous. Newspapers pictured it as Dana’s inseparable\r\ncompanion, and the _Sun_ presently had another, and longer, editorial\r\narticle about the wonderful beast:\r\n\r\n    The universal interest which this accomplished animal has\r\n    excited throughout the country is a striking refutation that\r\n    genius is not honored in its own day and generation. Perhaps no\r\n    other living critic has attained the popularity and vogue now\r\n    enjoyed by our cat. For years he worked in silence, unknown,\r\n    perhaps, beyond the limits of the office. He is a sort of\r\n    Rosicrucian cat, and his motto has been “to know all and to\r\n    keep himself unknown.” But he could not escape the glory his\r\n    efforts deserved, and a few mornings ago he woke up, like\r\n    Byron, to find himself famous.\r\n\r\n    We are glad to announce that he hasn’t been puffed up by the\r\n    enthusiastic praise which comes to him from all sources.\r\n    He is the same industrious, conscientious, sharp-eyed, and\r\n    sharp-toothed censor of copy that he has always been, nor\r\n    should we have known that he is conscious of the admiration\r\n    he excites among his esteemed contemporaries of the press had\r\n    we not observed him in the act of dilacerating a copy of the\r\n    _Graphic_ containing an alleged portrait of him.\r\n\r\n    It was impossible not to sympathize with his evident\r\n    indignation. The _Graphic’s_ portrait did foul injustice to his\r\n    majestic and intellectual features. Besides, it represented him\r\n    as having a bandage over one eye, as if he had been involved\r\n    in controversy and had had his eye mashed. Now, aside from the\r\n    fact that he needs both eyes to discharge his literary duties\r\n    properly, he is able to whip his weight in office cats, and\r\n    his fine, large eyes have never been shrouded in black, and we\r\n    don’t believe they ever will be. He is a soldier as well as a\r\n    scholar.\r\n\r\n    We have received many requests to give a detailed account\r\n    of the personal habits and peculiarities of this feline\r\n    Aristarchus. Indeed, we have been requested to prepare a full\r\n    biographical sketch to appear in the next edition of “Homes of\r\n    American Authors.” At some future day we may satisfy public\r\n    curiosity with the details of his literary methods. But genius\r\n    such as his defies analysis, and the privacy of a celebrity\r\n    ought not to be rudely invaded.\r\n\r\n    It is not out of place, however, to indicate a few traits which\r\n    illustrate his extraordinary faculty of literary decomposition,\r\n    so to speak. His favorite food is a tariff discussion. When\r\n    a big speech, full of wind and statistics, comes within his\r\n    reach, he pounces upon it immediately and digests the figures\r\n    at his leisure. During the discussion of the Morrison Bill he\r\n    used to feed steadily on tariff speeches for eight hours a day,\r\n    and yet his appetite remained unimpaired.\r\n\r\n    When a piece of stale news or a long-winded, prosy article\r\n    comes into the office, his remarkable sense of smell instantly\r\n    detects it, and it is impossible to keep it from him. He always\r\n    assists with great interest at the opening of the office mail,\r\n    and he files several hundred letters a day in his interior\r\n    department. The favorite diversion of the office-boys is to\r\n    make him jump for twelve-column articles on the restoration of\r\n    the American merchant marine.\r\n\r\n    He takes a keen delight in hunting for essays on civil-service\r\n    reform, and will play with them, if he has time, for hours.\r\n    They are so pretty that he hates to kill them, but duty\r\n    is duty. Clumsy and awkward English he springs at with\r\n    indescribable quickness and ferocity; but he won’t eat it. He\r\n    simply tears it up. He can’t stand everything.\r\n\r\n    We don’t pretend he is perfect. We admit that he has an\r\n    uncontrollable appetite for the _Congressional Record_. We have\r\n    to keep this peculiar publication out of his reach. He will sit\r\n    for hours and watch with burning eyes the iron safe in which\r\n    we are obliged to shut up the _Record_ for safe-keeping. Once\r\n    in a while we let him have a number or two. He becomes uneasy\r\n    without it. It is his catnip.\r\n\r\n    With the exception of this pardonable excess he is a blameless\r\n    beast. He mouses out all the stupid stuff and nonsense that\r\n    finds its way into the office and goes for it tooth and claw.\r\n    He is the biggest copyholder in the world. And he never gets\r\n    tired. His health is good, and we have not deemed it necessary\r\n    to take out a policy on any one of his valuable lives.\r\n\r\n    Many of our esteemed contemporaries are furnishing their\r\n    offices with cats, but they can never hope to have the equal of\r\n    the _Sun’s_ venerable polyphage. He is a cat of genius.\r\n\r\nThe cat may have contracted his hatred of the dull and prosy from the\r\nmen who worked in the _Sun_ office when Amos Cummings smiled and swore\r\nand got out the greatest four-page paper ever seen, singing the while\r\nthe song of Walker’s filibusters:\r\n\r\n  How would you like a soldier’s life\r\n    On the plains of Nicara-goo?\r\n  Marching away and fighting all day,\r\n  Nothing to eat and as much to pay--\r\n  We do it all for glory, they say,\r\n  On the plains of Nicara-goo.\r\n  Not a bit of breakfast did I see,\r\n  And dinner was all the same to me;\r\n  Two fried cats and three fried rats\r\n    Was a supper at Nicara-goo.\r\n  Marching away and fighting all day,\r\n  Nothing to eat and as much to pay--\r\n  We do it all for glory, they say,\r\n    On the plains of Nicara-goo!\r\n\r\nCummings worked so hard that in 1873 he broke down and the _Sun_ sent\r\nhim to Florida. There he wandered about, exploring rivers, studying\r\nthe natives, and writing for the _Sun_, over the signature of “Ziska,”\r\na series of travel letters as interesting as any that ever appeared\r\nin a newspaper. When he returned to New York in 1876, John Kelly,\r\nthen endeavouring to raise Tammany from the mire into which Tweed had\r\ndropped it, persuaded Cummings to become managing editor of the New\r\nYork _Express_. Cummings did not stay long on the _Express_, being\r\ndisgusted with Kelly’s hostility toward Tilden’s candidacy for the\r\npresidential nomination, and he went back to the _Sun_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    DANIEL F. KELLOGG\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    AMOS B. STILLMAN\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    JOHN B. BOGART\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor the next ten years his efforts were mostly in the direction of\r\nimproving the weekly issue. In 1886 he was elected to the House\r\nof Representatives from a West Side district, but he maintained\r\nhis connection with the _Sun_, and in 1887 he became editor of the\r\n_Evening Sun_, then just started. In 1888 Cummings resigned from the\r\nHouse, saying that he was too poor to be a Congressman, but on the\r\ndeath of Representative Samuel Sullivan (“Sunset”) Cox he consented\r\nto take the vacant place and continue Cox’s battles for the welfare\r\nof the letter-carriers. His service in the House lasted fifteen\r\nyears. Cummings was a great labour advocate, not only in behalf\r\nof letter-carriers, but of printers, navy-yard employees, and\r\nmusicians. He had the last-named in mind when he said in a speech on an\r\nalien-labour bill:\r\n\r\n    As the law now stands, when a German student, or one of those\r\n    fellows that swill beer along the Rhine, desires to come here\r\n    for the summer, all he has to do is to get a saxophone or some\r\n    other kind of musical instrument, call himself an artist, and\r\n    be allowed to land here.\r\n\r\nThat was Amos’s convincing, if inelegant, style. When he introduced a\r\nbill to compensate navy-yard men for labour already performed, but not\r\npaid for, Representative Holman, of Indiana, asked:\r\n\r\n“How much money will it take out of the Treasury?”\r\n\r\n“None of your business!” snapped Cummings. “The government must pay its\r\njust debts.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was in the House, Cummings wrote a series of articles on the\r\nbig men of Washington. He was a delegate to the Democratic national\r\nconventions of 1892 and 1896. He died in Baltimore May 2, 1902, and\r\na Republican House of Representatives voted a public funeral to this\r\nmilitant Democrat.\r\n\r\nGreater news men than Cummings followed him, undoubtedly, but there was\r\nno newspaperman in New York before his time who knew better what news\r\nwas or how to handle it; not even the elder Bennett, for that great man\r\nknew only the news that looked big. Cummings was the first to know the\r\nnews that felt big.\r\n\r\nIt was Cummings and his work that Henry Watterson had in mind when he\r\none day remarked to Mr. Dana:\r\n\r\n“The _Sun_ is a damned good paper, but you don’t make it.”\r\n\r\nThat statement undoubtedly pleased the editor of the _Sun_, for it was\r\nevidence from an expert that he had carried his theory to success.\r\nHe had set men free to write what they saw, as they saw it, in their\r\nown way. It was the _Sun_ way, and that was what he wanted. As Dana\r\nhimself handed down this heritage of literary freedom in his editorial\r\npage to Mitchell, so he gave to the men on the news pages, through Amos\r\nCummings and Chester S. Lord and their successors, the right to watch\r\nwith open eyes the world pass by, and to describe that parade in a\r\ndifferent way three hundred and sixty-five days a year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDANA’S FAMOUS RIVALS PASS\r\n\r\n  _The Deaths of Raymond, Bennett, and Greeley Leave Him the Dominant\r\n    Figure of the American Newspaper Field.--Dana’s Dream of a Paper\r\n    Without Advertisements._\r\n\r\n\r\nFour years after he became the master of the _Sun_, and a quarter\r\nof a century before death took him from it, Dana found himself the\r\nNestor of metropolitan journalism. Of the three other great New York\r\neditors of Dana’s time--three who had founded their own papers and\r\nlived with those papers until the wing of Azrael shut out the roar of\r\nthe presses--Raymond had been the first, and the youngest, to go; for\r\nhis end came when he was only forty-nine, eighteen years after the\r\nestablishment of his _Times_.\r\n\r\nBennett, the inscrutable monarch of the _Herald_, died in 1872, three\r\nyears after Raymond, but Bennett, who did not establish the _Herald_\r\nuntil he was forty, had owned it, and had given every waking hour to\r\nits welfare, for thirty-seven years. The year of Bennett’s death saw\r\nthe passing of the unfortunate Greeley, broken in body and mind from\r\nhis fatuous chase of public office, within three weeks of his defeat\r\nfor the presidency. As the sprightly young editor of the Louisville\r\n_Courier-Journal_, Colonel Henry Watterson, wrote in his paper in\r\nJanuary, 1873:\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bryant being no longer actively engaged in newspaper work,\r\n    Mr. Dana is left alone to tell the tale of old-time journalism\r\n    in New York. He, of all his fellow editors of the great\r\n    metropolis, has passed the period of middle age; though--years\r\n    apart--he is as blithe and nimble as the youngest of them,\r\n    and has performed, with the _Sun_, a feat in modern newspaper\r\n    practice that entitles him to the stag-horns laid down at his\r\n    death by James Gordon Bennett. Mr. Dana is no less a writer and\r\n    scholar than an editor; as witness his sketch of Mr. Greeley,\r\n    which for thorough character-drawing is unsurpassed. In a word,\r\n    Mr. Dana at fifty-three is as vigorous, sinewy, and live as a\r\n    young buck of thirty-five or forty.\r\n\r\n    His professional associates were boys when he was managing\r\n    editor of the _Tribune_. Manton Marble was at college at\r\n    Rochester, and Whitelaw Reid was going to school in Ohio. Young\r\n    Bennett and Bundy were wearing short jackets.\r\n\r\n    They were rough-and-tumble days, sure enough, even for New\r\n    York. There was no Central Park. Madison Square was “out of\r\n    town.” Franconi’s Circus, surnamed a “hippodrome,” sprawled its\r\n    ugly wooden towers, minarets, and sideshows over the ground\r\n    now occupied by the Fifth Avenue Hotel. _Miss Flora McFlimsy_\r\n    of the opposite square had not come into being; nay, Madison\r\n    Square itself existed in a city ordinance merely, and, like the\r\n    original of Mr. Praed’s Darnell Park, was a wretched waste of\r\n    common, where the boys skated and played shinny.\r\n\r\n    The elder Harpers stood in the shoes now worn by their\r\n    sons, who were off at boarding-school. George Ripley was as\r\n    larky as John Hay is. Delmonico’s, down-town, was the only\r\n    Delmonico’s. The warfare between the newspapers constituted\r\n    the most exciting topic of the time. Bennett was “Jack Ketch,”\r\n    Raymond was the “little villain,” and Greeley was by turns an\r\n    “incendiary,” a “white-livered poltroon,” and a “free-lover.”\r\n    Parke Godwin and Charles A. Dana were managing editors\r\n    respectively; both scholars and both, as writers, superior to\r\n    all the rest, except Greeley, who, as a newspaper writer, never\r\n    had a superior.\r\n\r\n    The situation is changed completely. Bennett, Greeley, and\r\n    Raymond are dead. Dana and Godwin, both about of an age, stand\r\n    at the head of New York journalism; while Reid, Marble, and\r\n    Jennings, all young men, wear the purple of a new era.\r\n\r\n    Will it be an era of reforms? There are signs that it will be.\r\n    Marble is a recruit. Reid is essentially a man of the world.\r\n    Jennings is an Englishman. One would think that these three,\r\n    led by two ripe scholars and gentlemen like Godwin and Dana,\r\n    would alter the character of the old partisan warfare in one\r\n    respect at least, and that if they have need to be personal,\r\n    they will be wittily so, and not brutally and dirtily personal;\r\n    the which will be an advance.\r\n\r\n    There will never be an end to the personality of journalism.\r\n    But there is already an end of the efficacy of filth. In this,\r\n    as in other things, there are fashions. What ill thing, for\r\n    example, can be said personally injurious of Reid, Marble,\r\n    Jennings, Bundy, and the rest, all hard-working, painstaking\r\n    men, without vices or peculiarities, who do not invite attack?\r\n\r\n    On the whole, the newspaper prospect in New York is very good.\r\n    There will be, perhaps, less of what we call “character” in New\r\n    York journalism, but more usefulness, honesty, and culture and\r\n    as the New York dailies, like the New York milliners, set the\r\n    fashion, these excellent qualities will diffuse themselves over\r\n    the country. They may even reach Nashville and Memphis. It is\r\n    an age of miracles. Who can tell?\r\n\r\n“There will never be an end to the personality of journalism.” It is\r\ncurious to note in passing that Henry Watterson, who retired from the\r\nactive editorship of the _Courier-Journal_ on August 7, 1918, after\r\nfifty years’ service, was the last of the men who, according to the\r\nmeasure of forty years ago, were “personal journalists.” “Dana says,”\r\n“Greeley says,” “Raymond says”--such oral credits are no longer given\r\nby the readers of the really big and reputable newspapers of New York\r\nto the men who write opinions. “Henry Watterson says” was the last of\r\nthe phrases of that style.\r\n\r\nDana believed in personal journalism and thought it would not pass\r\naway. A few days after the death of Horace Greeley, the editor of the\r\n_Sun_ printed his views on the subject:\r\n\r\n    A great deal of twaddle is uttered by some country newspapers\r\n    just now over what they call personal journalism. They say that\r\n    now that Mr. Bennett, Mr. Raymond, and Mr. Greeley are dead,\r\n    the day for personal journalism is gone by, and that impersonal\r\n    journalism will take its place. That appears to be a sort of\r\n    journalism in which nobody will ask who is the editor of a\r\n    paper or the writer of any class of article, and nobody will\r\n    care.\r\n\r\n    Whenever in the newspaper profession a man rises up who is\r\n    original, strong, and bold enough to make his opinions a\r\n    matter of consequence to the public, there will be personal\r\n    journalism; and whenever newspapers are conducted only by\r\n    commonplace individuals whose views are of no interest to the\r\n    world and of no consequence to anybody, there will be nothing\r\n    but impersonal journalism.\r\n\r\n    And this is the essence of the whole question.\r\n\r\nFor all that, Dana must have felt lonely, for at that moment, at any\r\nrate, the new chiefs of the _Sun’s_ rivals did not measure up to the\r\nheights of their predecessors. To Dana, the trio that had passed\r\nwere men worthy of his steel, and worthy, each in his own way, of\r\nadmiration. Toward Greeley, in spite of the circumstances under which\r\nDana left the _Tribune_, the editor of the _Sun_ showed a kindly\r\nspirit; not only in his support of Greeley for the presidency, which\r\nmay have sprung from Dana’s aversion to Grantism, but in his general\r\nattitude toward the brilliant if erratic old man. As for Bennett, Dana\r\nfrankly believed him to be a great newspaperman, and never hesitated to\r\nsay so.\r\n\r\nWhat Dana thought of the three may be judged by his editorial article\r\nin the _Sun_ on the day after Greeley’s funeral:\r\n\r\n    In burying Mr. Greeley we bury the third founder of a newspaper\r\n    which has become famous and wealthy in this city during the\r\n    last thirty-five years. Mr. Raymond died three years and Mr.\r\n    Bennett barely six months ago.\r\n\r\n    These three men were exceedingly unlike each other, yet each of\r\n    them possessed extraordinary professional talents. Mr. Raymond\r\n    surpassed both Mr. Bennett and Mr. Greeley in the versatility\r\n    of his accomplishments, and in facility and smoothness as a\r\n    writer. But he was less a journalist than either of the other\r\n    two. Nature had rather intended him for a lawyer, and success\r\n    as a legislative debater and presiding officer had directed his\r\n    ambition toward that kind of life.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Bennett was exclusively a newspaperman. He was equally\r\n    great as a writer, a wit, and a purveyor of news; and he never\r\n    showed any desire to leave a profession in which he had made\r\n    himself rich and formidable.\r\n\r\n    Horace Greeley delighted to be a maker of newspapers, not so\r\n    much for the thing itself, though to that he was sincerely\r\n    attached, as for the sake of promoting doctrines, ideas, and\r\n    theories in which he was a believer; and his personal ambition,\r\n    which was very profound and never inoperative, made him wish to\r\n    be Governor, Legislator, Senator, Cabinet Minister, President,\r\n    because such elevation seemed to afford the clearest possible\r\n    evidence that he himself was appreciated and that the cause he\r\n    espoused had gained the hearts of the people. How incomplete,\r\n    indeed, would be the triumph of any set of principles if\r\n    their chief advocate and promoter were to go unrecognized and\r\n    unhonored!\r\n\r\n    It is a most impressive circumstance that each of these three\r\n    great journalists has had to die a tragic and pitiable death.\r\n    One perished by apoplexy long after midnight in the entrance\r\n    of his own home; another closed his eyes with no relative near\r\n    him to perform that last sad office; and the third, broken down\r\n    by toils, excitements, and sufferings too strong to be borne,\r\n    breathed his last in a private madhouse. What a lesson to the\r\n    possessors of power, for these three men were powerful beyond\r\n    others! What a commentary upon human greatness, for they were\r\n    rich and great, and were looked upon with envy by thousands\r\n    who thought themselves less fortunate than they! And amid such\r\n    startling surprises and such a prodigious conflict of lights\r\n    and shadows, the curtain falls as the tired actor, crowned with\r\n    long applause, passes from that which seems to that which is.\r\n\r\nLouis J. Jennings succeeded Raymond as the editor of the _Times_, and\r\nacted as such until 1876, when he returned to England, his desk being\r\ntaken by John Foord. Jennings went into politics in England, and was\r\nelected a member of Parliament. He also wrote a life of Gladstone and\r\nedited a collection of Lord Randolph Churchill’s speeches.\r\n\r\nBennett was followed in the possession of the _Herald_ by his son\r\nand namesake. Whitelaw Reid took Greeley’s place at the head of the\r\n_Tribune_. Dana did not like Reid in those days. In a “Survey of\r\nMetropolitan Journalism” which appeared in the editorial columns of the\r\n_Sun_ on September 3, 1875--the _Sun’s_ forty-second birthday--Dana\r\ndismissed his neighbour of the then “tall tower” with--\r\n\r\n    We pass the _Tribune_ by. Our opinion of it is well known. It\r\n    is Jay Gould’s paper, and a disgrace to journalism.\r\n\r\nDana’s attitude toward the other big newspapers was more kindly:\r\n\r\n    The _Times_ is a very respectable paper, and more than that, a\r\n    journal of which the Republican party has reason to be proud.\r\n    It is not a servile organ, but a loyal partisan. We prefer for\r\n    our own part to keep aloof from the party politicians. They are\r\n    disagreeable fellows to have hanging about a newspaper office,\r\n    and their advice we do not regard as valuable. But we do not\r\n    decry party newspapers. They have their field, and must always\r\n    exist. The _Times_ is a creditable example of such a newspaper.\r\n    It would be better, however, if Mr. Jennings himself wrote the\r\n    whole editorial page.\r\n\r\n    The mistake of the _Times_ was in lapsing into the dulness of\r\n    respectable conservatism after its Ring fight. It should have\r\n    kept on and made a crusade against frauds of all sorts.\r\n\r\n    The _Herald_ has improved since young Mr. Bennett’s return. We\r\n    are attracted toward this son of his father. He has a passion\r\n    for manly sports, and that we like. If the shabby writers who\r\n    make jest of his walking-matches had an income of three or\r\n    four hundred thousand dollars a year, perhaps they would drive\r\n    in carriages instead of walking and dawdle away their time\r\n    on beds of ease or the gorgeous sofas of the Lotos Club. Mr.\r\n    Bennett does otherwise. He strides up Broadway with the step of\r\n    an athlete, dons his navy blue and commands his yacht, shoots\r\n    pigeons, and prefers the open air of Newport to the confinement\r\n    of the _Herald_ office.\r\n\r\n    The _World_ is a journal which pleases us on many accounts ...\r\n    but occasionally there is a bit of prurient wit in its columns\r\n    that might better be omitted. The _World_ is also too often\r\n    written in too fantastic language. Its young men seem to vie\r\n    with each other in tormenting the language. They will do better\r\n    when they learn that there is more force in simple Anglo-Saxon\r\n    than in all the words they can manufacture. We advise them to\r\n    read the Bible and Common Prayer Book. Those books will do\r\n    their souls good, anyway, and they may also learn to write less\r\n    affectedly.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ was as frank in discussing its own theories and ambitions\r\nas it was in criticising its contemporaries for dulness and poor\r\nwriting. Dana’s dream, never to be realized, was a newspaper without\r\nadvertisements. He believed that by getting all the news, condensing\r\nit into the smallest readable space, and adding such literary matter\r\nas the readers’ tastes demanded, a four-page paper might be produced\r\nwith a reasonable profit from the sales, after paper and ink, men and\r\nmachinery, had been paid for.\r\n\r\nAn editorial article in the _Sun_ on March 13, 1875, was practically a\r\nprospectus of this idea:\r\n\r\n    Until Robert Bonner sagaciously foresaw a handsome profit to\r\n    be realized by excluding advertisements and crowding a small\r\n    sheet with such choice literature as would surely attract a\r\n    mighty throng of readers, never did the owner of any serial\r\n    publication so much as dream of making both ends meet without\r\n    a revenue from advertisements. The _Tribune_, the _Times_, and\r\n    the _Herald_ at length ceased to expect a profit from their\r\n    circulation, and then they came to care for large editions only\r\n    so far as they served to attract advertisers.\r\n\r\n    It was then that the _Sun_ conceived the idea of a daily\r\n    newspaper that should yield more satisfactory dividends from\r\n    large circulation than had ever been declared by the journals\r\n    that had looked to the organism of political parties and to\r\n    enterprising advertisers for the bulk of their income. It saw\r\n    in New York a city of sufficient population to warrant the\r\n    experiment of a two-cent newspaper whose cost should equal that\r\n    of the four-cent dailies in every respect, the cost of white\r\n    paper alone excepted. Accordingly we produced the _Sun_ on a\r\n    sheet that leaves a small margin for profit, and by restricting\r\n    the space allotted to advertisers and eliminating the verbiage\r\n    in which the eight-page dailies hide the news, we made room in\r\n    the _Sun_ for not only all the real news of the day, but for\r\n    interesting literature and current political discussion as well.\r\n\r\n    It was an enterprise that the public encouraged with avidity.\r\n    The edition rapidly rose to one hundred and twenty thousand\r\n    copies daily, and it is now rising; while the small margin\r\n    of profit on that enormous circulation makes the _Sun_\r\n    able to exist without paying any special attention to\r\n    advertising--approaching very closely, in fact, to the\r\n    condition of a daily newspaper able to support itself on the\r\n    profits of its circulation alone.\r\n\r\n    Only a single further step remains to be taken. That step was\r\n    recently foreshadowed in a leader in which the _Sun_ intimated\r\n    that the time was not far distant in which it would reject more\r\n    advertising than it would accept. With a daily circulation of\r\n    fifty or a hundred thousand more, there is little doubt that\r\n    the _Sun_ would find it necessary to limit the advertisers as\r\n    the reporters and other writers for its columns are limited,\r\n    each to a space to be determined by the public interest in his\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    It will be a long stride in the progress of intellectual\r\n    as distinguished from commercial journalism, and the _Sun_\r\n    will probably be the first to make it, thus distancing the\r\n    successors of Raymond, Bennett, and Greeley in the great\r\n    sweepstakes for recognition as the Journal of the Future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    JAMES GORDON BENNETT, SR.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    HORACE GREELEY\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    HENRY J. RAYMOND\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, in recalling the failure of Dana’s dream of a\r\npaper _sans_ advertising, that his mind was not usually the port of\r\nvain dreams. He was a practical man, with more business sense than any\r\nother editor of his time, Bennett alone excepted. In him imagination\r\nhad not swallowed arithmetic, and there is no possible doubt that he\r\nhad good reason to believe in the practicability of the program he\r\nso candidly outlined to his readers. It was part and parcel of his\r\nfaith in a four-page newspaper--a faith so strong, so well grounded on\r\nresults, that for the first twenty years of the Dana régime the _Sun_\r\nnever appeared in more than four pages, except in emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn the end, of course, the scheme was beaten by the very excellence of\r\nits originator’s qualities. The _Sun_, by its popularity, drew more\r\nand more advertising. By its good English, its freedom from literary\r\nshackles, and the spirit of its staff, it attracted more and more\r\nwriters of distinction, each unwilling to be denied his place in the\r\n_Sun_. Dana always had unlimited space for a good story, just as the\r\ncat had an insatiable appetite for a bad one; and thus, through his\r\nown genius, he destroyed his own dream, but not without having almost\r\nproved that it was possible of realisation.\r\n\r\nDana believed that most of the newspapers of his day--particularly in\r\nthe seventies--were tiring out not only the reader, but the writer.\r\nCommenting on a decline in the newspaper business in the summer of\r\n1875, the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    Some of our big contemporaries have been overdoing the thing.\r\n    They seem to think that to secure circulation it is necessary\r\n    to overload the stomachs of their readers.\r\n\r\n    The American newspaper-reader demands of an editor that he\r\n    shall not give him news and discussions in heavy chunks, but\r\n    so condensed and clarified that he shall be relieved of the\r\n    necessity of wading through a treatise to get at a fact, or\r\n    spending time on a dilated essay to get a bite at an argument.\r\n\r\n    Six or seven dreary columns are filled with leading\r\n    articles, no matter whether there are subjects to discuss of\r\n    public interest, or brains at hand to treat them. Our big\r\n    contemporaries exhaust their young men and drive them too\r\n    hard. The stock of ideas is not limitless, even in a New York\r\n    newspaper office.\r\n\r\n    Another thing has been bad. Men with actual capacity of\r\n    certain sorts for acceptable writing have been frightened off\r\n    from doing natural and vigorous work by certain newspaper\r\n    critics and doctrinaires who are in distress if the literary\r\n    proprieties are seemingly violated, and if the temper and\r\n    blood of the writer actually show in his work. They measure\r\n    our journalistic production by an English standard, which lays\r\n    it down as its first and most imperative rule that editorial\r\n    writing shall be free from the characteristics of the writer.\r\n    This is ruinous to good writing, and damaging to the sincerity\r\n    of writers.... If we choose to glow or cry out in indignation,\r\n    we do so, and we are not a bit frightened at the sound of our\r\n    own voice.\r\n\r\nDana himself had that peculiar faculty, as indescribable as instinct,\r\nof knowing, when he saw an article in the paper, just how much work\r\nthe author of it had put in--particularly in cases where the labour\r\nhad been in leaving out, rather than in writing. As a result of this\r\nintuition he never drove his men. He would accept three lines or three\r\ncolumns for a day’s work, and his admiration might go out more heartily\r\nto the three lines. As for the appearance of characteristics in men’s\r\nwriting, that was as necessary, in Dana’s opinion, as it was wicked in\r\nthe judgment of the ancient editors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n“THE SUN” AND THE GRANT SCANDALS\r\n\r\n  _Dana’s Relentless Fight Against the Whisky Ring, Crédit Mobilier,\r\n    “Addition, Division, and Silence,” the Safe Burglary Conspiracy\r\n    and the Boss Shepherd Scandal._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first ten years of Dana’s service on the _Sun_ were marked by\r\nthe uprooting of many public evils. To use the mild phrasing of the\r\nhistorian John Fiske, “Villains sometimes succeeded in imposing upon\r\nPresident Grant, who was an honest, simple-hearted soldier without\r\nmuch knowledge of the ways of the world.” To say it more concretely,\r\nhardly a department of the national government but was alive with\r\nfraud. The _Sun_, which had supported Grant in the election of\r\n1868, turned against his administration in its first months, and\r\nfor years it continued to keep before the public the revelations of\r\ncorruption--which were easily made, so bold were the scoundrels, so\r\ncoarse their manner of theft.\r\n\r\nAmong the scandals which the _Sun_ either brought to light or was most\r\nvigorous in assailing, these were the principal:\r\n\r\nThe Crédit Mobilier Scandal--This involved the names of many Senators\r\nand Representatives who were accused of accepting stock in the Crédit\r\nMobilier of America, the fiscal company organised to build the Union\r\nPacific Railroad, as a reward for using their influence and votes in\r\nfavour of the great enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Navy Department Scandal--In this the _Sun_ accused George M.\r\nRobeson, Secretary of the Navy, of having permitted double payment\r\nto contractors and of violating the law in making large purchases\r\nwithout competitive bidding. Mr. Dana appeared as a witness in the\r\nCongressional investigation of Robeson, who, in the end, while not\r\nconvicted of personal corruption, was censured for the laxity of his\r\nofficial methods.\r\n\r\nThe Whisky Ring--This evil combination cheated the government out\r\nof millions of dollars. It was made up of distillers, wholesale\r\nliquor-dealers, and employees of the internal revenue office, these\r\nconspiring together to avoid the payment of the liquor tax. The first\r\nattack on the corrupt alliance was made in the _Sun_ of February\r\n3, 1872, in an article by “Sappho,” one of the _Sun’s_ Washington\r\ncorrespondents. Other great newspapers took up the fight, but the _Sun_\r\nwas the chief aggressor. As a result of the exposure, two hundred and\r\nthirty-eight men were indicted and many of them, including the chief\r\nclerk of the Treasury Department, were sent to prison.\r\n\r\n“Addition, Division, and Silence”--On March 20, 1867, W. H. Kemble,\r\nState Treasurer of Pennsylvania and one of the Republican bosses, wrote\r\nthe following letter to Titian J. Coffey, a lawyer and claim-agent in\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR TITIAN:\r\n\r\n    Allow me to introduce to you my particular friend, Mr. George\r\n    O. Evans. He has a claim of some magnitude that he wishes you\r\n    to help him in. Put him through as you would me. He understands\r\n    addition, division, and silence.\r\n\r\n                                        W. H. KEMBLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this letter fell into the hands of the _Sun_, which had already\r\nmade war on the ring formed for the collection of war claims, it saw\r\nin Kemble’s last four words the sententious platform of wide-spread\r\nfraud. It printed the letter, and kept on printing it, with that\r\niteration which Dana knew was of value in a crusade. In a few months\r\nthe whole country was familiar with the phrase so suggestive of plunder.\r\n\r\nKemble was a politician with a thick skin, but he at last became so\r\nenraged at the repetition of “addition, division, and silence,” whether\r\nuttered by street urchins or printed all over America as the watchword\r\nof corruption--“honest graft,” he would have called it, if that phrase\r\nhad then been common--that he sued out a writ of criminal libel against\r\nMr. Dana and had him arrested as he was passing through Philadelphia.\r\nThe only result of this was to make the phrase more common than before.\r\n\r\nKemble was afterward convicted of trying to bribe Pennsylvania\r\nlegislators, and was sent to prison for a year.\r\n\r\nThe Post-Trader Scandal--William W. Belknap, Grant’s Secretary of\r\nWar, was charged with receiving from Caleb P. Marsh fifteen hundred\r\ndollars in consideration for the appointment of John S. Evans to\r\nmaintain a trading-establishment at Fort Sill, in the Indian Territory.\r\nThe scandal came to the surface through the remark of Mrs. Belknap\r\nthat Mrs. Evans would have no place in society, “as she is only a\r\npost-trader’s wife,” and the retort of Mrs. Evans, upon hearing of\r\nthis, that “a post-trader’s wife is as good as the wife of an official\r\nwho takes money for the appointment of a post-trader.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ laid the story of bribery wide open, and the Senate proceeded\r\nto impeach the Secretary of War. He escaped punishment by resigning\r\nhis office, twenty-five Senators voting “not guilty” on the ground\r\nthat Belknap’s resignation technically removed him from the Senate’s\r\njurisdiction. Thirty-five Senators voted “guilty,” but a two-thirds\r\nvote was necessary to punish.\r\n\r\nThe Salary Grab--This was the act of Congress of March 3, 1873, which\r\nraised the President’s salary from twenty-five thousand dollars to\r\nfifty thousand, and the salaries of Senators and Representatives\r\nfrom five thousand to seventy-five hundred. Its evil lay not in the\r\nincreases, but in the retroactive clause which provided that each\r\nCongressman should receive five thousand dollars as extra pay for\r\nthe two-year term then ending. The assaults of the _Sun_ and other\r\nnewspapers so aroused public indignation that Congress was obliged to\r\nrepeal the act in January, 1874, and many Members returned their share\r\nof the spoil to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Boss Shepherd Scandal--The _Sun_ printed an article from Washington\r\naccusing Alexander Shepherd, vice-president of the Board of Public\r\nWorks of the District of Columbia, and Henry D. Cooke, governor of the\r\nDistrict, with having a financial interest in the Metropolitan Paving\r\nCompany, which had many street contracts in the national capital.\r\nShepherd and Cooke laid a complaint of criminal libel against Mr. Dana,\r\nand an assistant district attorney of the District of Columbia came\r\nto New York and procured from United States Commissioner Davenport a\r\nwarrant for the editor’s arrest.\r\n\r\nIt was the intent of the prosecution to hale Dana to a Washington\r\npolice-court, where he would be tried without a jury. Dana had gone\r\nwillingly, even eagerly, to Washington when summoned in the Robeson\r\ncase, but the Shepherd strategy was so manifestly an attempt to\r\nrailroad him that an appeal was taken to the Federal court for the\r\nsouthern district of New York. The historic decision of the district\r\njudge--Samuel Blatchford, subsequently promoted to the United States\r\nSupreme Court--may be summed up in one of its paragraphs:\r\n\r\n    The Constitution says that all trials shall be by jury, and\r\n    the accused is entitled, not to be first convicted by a court\r\n    and then to be convicted by a jury, but to be convicted or\r\n    acquitted _in the first instance_ by a jury.\r\n\r\nAs the _Sun_ said of this decision, important to the freedom of the\r\nindividual as well as to that of the press:\r\n\r\n    Those who sought to murder liberty, where they looked for a\r\n    second Jeffreys, found a second Mansfield.\r\n\r\nThe Safe Burglary Conspiracy--Columbus Alexander, a reputable citizen\r\nof Washington, was active in the movement to smash the Washington\r\ncontractors’ ring. He sought to bring certain contractors’ books into\r\ncourt and exposed the false set that was produced. The ringsters hired\r\na man to go to Mr. Alexander with a story that he could bring him the\r\ngenuine books. Then the gang, which included men in the secret-service\r\ndepartments of the government, placed some of the genuine books in the\r\nsafe of the district attorney’s office and employed three professional\r\nburglars to blow open the safe.\r\n\r\nThe books, taken from the safe, were carried to Alexander’s home by the\r\nman who had approached him. Close behind came police, who were prepared\r\nto arrest Alexander as soon as he received the “stolen property.”\r\nHe was to be accused of hiring the burglars to crack the district\r\nattorney’s safe. But the hour was early in the morning, Alexander was\r\nsleeping the deep sleep of the just, and the criminal rang his doorbell\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nThe ringsters then “arrested” the “thief,” and caused him to sign\r\na false confession, accusing Alexander; but the failure of their\r\ntheatricals had broken the hireling’s nerve as well as their own, and\r\nthe conspiracy collapsed. Two of the hired criminals turned state’s\r\nevidence at the trial, but the powerful politicians of the ring were\r\nable to bring about a disagreement of the jury.\r\n\r\nThese were the greatest of the scandals which the _Sun_ exposed in its\r\nnews columns and denounced on its editorial page. It was the cry of the\r\nringsters, and even of some honest men, that the _Sun’s_ assaults on\r\nthe evils that marred Grant’s administration were the result of Dana’s\r\npersonal dislike of the President. More specifically it was declared\r\nthat Dana was a disappointed office-seeker, and that the place of\r\ncollector of customs at the port of New York was the office he sought.\r\n\r\nWe have it on the unimpeachable testimony of General James Harrison\r\nWilson, the biographer of Dana, and, with Dana, a biographer of Grant,\r\nthat General Rawlins, Grant’s most intimate friend, told Dana’s\r\nassociates, and particularly General Wilson, that Dana was to be\r\nappointed collector. There is no evidence that Dana ever asked Grant,\r\nor any other man, for public office. One place, that of appraiser of\r\nmerchandise at the port of New York, was offered him, and he refused\r\nit. The _Sun_ said editorially, replying to an insinuation made by the\r\n_Commercial Advertiser_ that if Dana had been made collector his paper\r\nwould not denounce the administration:\r\n\r\n    The idea that the editor of the _Sun_, which shines for all,\r\n    could consent to become collector of the port of New York is\r\n    extravagant and inadmissible. It would be stepping down and out\r\n    with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n    And yet we do not mean that the collector of New York need be\r\n    other than an upright man. Moses H. Grinnell was such, and Tom\r\n    Murphy, though a politician, a crony of Boss Grant, and one\r\n    of the donors of Boss Grant’s cottage, certainly never took a\r\n    dollar of money from the Federal Treasury to which he was not\r\n    entitled. General Arthur, the present collector, is a gentleman\r\n    in every sense of the word.\r\n\r\n    The office of collector is respectable enough, but it is not\r\n    one that the editor of the _Sun_ could desire to take without\r\n    deserving to have his conduct investigated by a proceeding _de\r\n    lunatico_.\r\n\r\nDana and the _Sun_ lost friends because of the assaults on Grantism.\r\nThe warfare was bitter and personal. In the case of Belknap, for\r\ninstance, the _Sun_ was attacking a man whom Dana, having known him as\r\na good soldier, had recommended for appointment as Secretary of War.\r\nBut it must be recalled that at the very height of his antagonism to\r\nGrant, the President, Dana never receded from his opinion that Grant,\r\nthe general, was the Union’s greatest soldier. And the _Sun_ was quick\r\nto applaud him as President when, as in currency matters, he took a\r\ncourse which Dana considered right.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Grant, nevertheless, turned against Dana and his\r\npaper. Some of them, stockholders in the Sun Printing and Publishing\r\nAssociation, quit the concern when they found themselves unable to turn\r\nDana from his purpose. All their pleadings were vain.\r\n\r\n“A few years from now,” Dana would reply, “I shall be willing to accept\r\nwhatever judgment the nation passes on my course of action; but now I\r\nmust do as I think right.”\r\n\r\nSo far as the material prosperity of the _Sun_ was concerned, the\r\ndesertion of Grant’s friends hurt it not a whit. For every reader lost,\r\nfour or five were won. Men may stop reading a paper because it disgusts\r\nthem; they rarely quit it because it is wounding them.\r\n\r\n“I don’t read the _Sun_,” said Henry Ward Beecher during his trial,\r\n“and don’t allow anybody to read it to me. What’s the good of a man\r\nsticking pins into himself?”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ made this reply to Beecher’s assertion:\r\n\r\n    Everybody reads the _Sun_--the good, that they may be\r\n    stimulated to do better; the bad, in fear and trembling lest\r\n    their wickedness shall meet its deserts.\r\n\r\nIn Beecher’s case, as in Grant’s, the _Sun_ believed that it was doing\r\na public service in laying open wrongful conditions. In answer to one\r\nwho criticised its brutal candour about the Plymouth Church scandal the\r\n_Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    The exposure of the moral nastiness in Brooklyn is a salutary\r\n    thing. If, when the exposure of the scandal took place, the\r\n    people had been indifferent--as indifferent as Beecher assumed\r\n    to be--and had received no shock to their sense of purity\r\n    and propriety, then the Jeremiahs might well have bewailed\r\n    the turpitude of society and prophesied evil things for the\r\n    country. Then, indeed, the poison would have been in the whole\r\n    social atmosphere....\r\n\r\n    The Plymouth pastor, if a guiltless man, has brought all this\r\n    trouble on himself by his cowardly course in dealing with the\r\n    accusations against him....\r\n\r\n    If he is not a bold man, strong in the truth and in purity,\r\n    what business has he to preach the religion of the Apostles\r\n    to his fellow men--he who distributed Sharp’s rifles to the\r\n    Kansas combatants with slavery, who denounced sin and bore\r\n    his head high as a man of freedom of thought and action? To\r\n    have kept himself consistent, he should not have dallied with\r\n    Tilton and Moulton in secret, but if entrenched in innocence\r\n    he should have dragged out their slanders and torn to pieces\r\n    their plans from the pulpit where he had preached courage under\r\n    difficulties, divine faith under sorrow, and bold encounter\r\n    with sin. This would soon have expelled the poison lurking in\r\n    the social atmosphere, but Beecher did not do it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Beecher’s thanks were not due to Dana, but Grant’s surely were.\r\nIt is impossible that scandals like those of the Whisky Ring could\r\nhave lain hidden forever. If they had not been exposed when they were,\r\nthey would have come to the top later, perhaps after Grant went out of\r\noffice, and when his cry, “Let no guilty man escape!” would have been\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ fights against the scandals of the Grant period were no\r\nmore bitter than its attacks on the frauds attending the Presidential\r\nelection of 1876, although Dana had no cause for personal animosity\r\ntoward Hayes. The _Sun’s_ chief Washington correspondent, A. M. Gibson,\r\nwho handled many of the Grant scandals, wrote most of the news stories\r\nabout the theft of the Presidency by Mr. Hayes’s managers. He also\r\npublished in book form an official history of the fraud.\r\n\r\nJoseph Pulitzer, then newly come from the West, was assigned by Dana\r\nto cover the proceedings of the Electoral Commission in semieditorial\r\nstyle. Pulitzer was later, in 1878, a European correspondent of the\r\n_Sun_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n“THE SUN” AND “HUMAN INTEREST”\r\n\r\n  _Something About Everything, for Everybody.--A Wonderful Four-Page\r\n    Paper.--A Comparison of the Styles of “Sun” Reporters in Three\r\n    Periods Twenty Years Apart._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political scandals made good reading, but the _Sun_ was not\r\ncontent to feed its readers on investigations. It put a little bit of\r\neverything on their breakfast-plates--the Moody and Sankey revivals,\r\nMr. Keely’s motor, which didn’t work, and young Edison’s multiple\r\ntelegraph, which did; the baseball games of the days when Spalding\r\npitched for Boston and Anson and Reach were at first and second base,\r\nrespectively, for the Philadelphia Athletics; the presentation of a\r\ncup to John Cable Heenan, the prize-fighter, as the handsomest and\r\nbest-dressed man at the ball of the Shandley Association; an interview\r\nwith Joaquin Miller on Longfellow; the wiggles of the sea-serpent\r\noff Swampscott; a ghost-story from Long Island, with a beautiful\r\nspook lashed to the rigging of a spectral bark; the arrival of New\r\nYork’s first Chinese laundryman; Father Tom Burke’s lectures on\r\nIreland; the lectures of Tyndall on newly-discovered phenomena of\r\nlight; the billiard-matches between Cyrille Dion and Maurice Daly; a\r\ntar-and-feathers party in Brooklyn--the _Sun_ skimmed the pan of life\r\nand served the cream for two cents.\r\n\r\nThe familiar three-story head-line, which was first used by the\r\n_Sun_ on the day of Grant’s inauguration, and which stayed the same\r\nuntil long after Mr. Dana’s death, attracted readers with the magic\r\nof the head-writers’ art. “The Skull in the Chimney,” “Shaved by a\r\nLady Barber,” “A Man Hanged by Women,” “Burned Alive for $5,000,”\r\n“The Murder in the Well,” “Death Leap in a Theatre,” “An Aged Sinner\r\nHanged,” “The Duel in the Bedroom,” “Horrors of a Madhouse,” “A Life\r\nfor a Love-Letter”--none could glance at the compelling titles of the\r\n_Sun_ stories without remaining to read. They are still fascinating in\r\nan age when lady barbers would attract no attention.\r\n\r\nA typical _Sun_ of 1874 might contain, in its four pages, six columns\r\nabout the Beecher-Tilton case; four columns of editorial articles;\r\na letter from Eli Perkins (Melville DeLancey Landon) at Saratoga,\r\ndeclaring that the spa was standing still commercially because of its\r\nlack of good drinking-water; a column, also from Saratoga, describing\r\nthe defeat of Preakness by Springbok; the latest in the strange case\r\nof Charley Ross; a column headed “Life in the Metropolis--Dashes Here\r\nand There by the _Sun’s_ Reporters”; a column of “Sunbeams,” a column\r\nabout trout-fishing, two columns of general news, and five columns of\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\r\nInstead of Eli Perkins’s letter, there might be a critique by Leopold\r\nDamrosch, from Baireuth, of Wagner’s “Götterdämmerung,” just presented;\r\nor a dissection, by “Monsieur X,” of E. A. Sothern’s _Dundreary_.\r\n“Monsieur X” was Napoleon Leon Thiéblin, who was for years one of the\r\n_Sun’s_ most distinguished critics and essayists. He was that kind of\r\nnewspaperman who could--and did--write on Saturday of the political\r\nnews of Bismarck and on Sunday of the crowd at Coney Island.\r\n\r\nThiéblin, who was of French blood, was born in St. Petersburg in 1834.\r\nHe was graduated at the Russian Imperial Academy of Artillery, and\r\ncommanded forty pieces of cannon at the siege of Sebastopol. At the\r\nclose of the Crimean War he went to London and became a member of the\r\nstaff of the _Pall Mall Gazette_, reporting for that journal the French\r\nside of the war with Germany in 1870–71, and the atrocities of the\r\nCommune, over the pen-name of “Azamet Batuk.” He reported the Carlist\r\nWar in Spain for the New York _Herald_, and then came to America to\r\nlecture, but Dana persuaded him to join the _Sun_ staff. He contributed\r\nto the _Sun_ many articles on foreign affairs, including a series\r\non European journalism; “The Stranger’s Note-Book,” which was made\r\nup of New York sketches; letters from the Centennial Exposition at\r\nPhiladelphia; and the Wall Street letters signed “Rigolo.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Sunbeams” column were crowded the vagrant wit and wisdom of\r\nthe world. The items concerned everything from great men in European\r\nchancelleries to organ-grinders in Nassau Street:\r\n\r\n    The mules are all dying in Arkansas.\r\n\r\n    A printer in Texas has named his first-born Brevier Fullfaced\r\n    Jones.\r\n\r\n    Real estate is looking up at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n    Translations from Hawthorne are becoming popular in France.\r\n\r\n    Venison costs six cents a pound in St. Paul.\r\n\r\n    Queen Victoria says every third woman in Cork is a beauty.\r\n\r\n    Goldwin Smith is coming to the United States.\r\n\r\n    The Pope denounces short dresses.\r\n\r\nThe same terseness is seen in the “Footlight Flashes,” begun in 1876:\r\n\r\n    Clara Morris takes her lap-dog out for a daily drive.\r\n\r\n    Miss Claxton is meeting with indifferent success in\r\n    “Conscience.”\r\n\r\n    Not less than $30,000 was spent last evening in the theatres of\r\n    New York.\r\n\r\n    John T. Raymond drew excellent houses as _Colonel Sellers_ at\r\n    the Brooklyn Theatre.\r\n\r\n    For the term of their appearance in “King Lear,” Lawrence\r\n    Barrett will receive $1,200 a week; E. E. Sheridan, $1,000;\r\n    Frederick B. Warde, $500.\r\n\r\nThe interview, invented by the elder Bennett, was becoming more and\r\nmore popular. The _Sun_ used it, not only as the vehicle of acquired\r\ninformation, but sometimes as the envelope of humour. Take, for\r\nexample, this bit, printed in 1875, but as fresh in style and spirit as\r\nif it were of the product of a reporter of 1918:\r\n\r\n    INTERVIEWING VANDERBILT\r\n\r\n    ANOTHER REPORTER COMES AWAY FREIGHTED WITH VALUABLE INFORMATION\r\n\r\n    Commodore Vanderbilt was eighty-one years old yesterday. He\r\n    spent the day in his Fourth Avenue offices, taking his usual\r\n    drive in the afternoon. A _Sun_ reporter visited him in the\r\n    evening to inquire about a favorable time for selling a few\r\n    thousands of New York Central.\r\n\r\n    “This,” said the commodore, slowly and solemnly, as he entered\r\n    the drawing-room, “is my birthday.”\r\n\r\n    “Indeed!” said the reporter. “Do you think the preferred\r\n    stock----”\r\n\r\n    “To-day,” the commodore interrupted, “I am eighty-one years\r\n    old. I am stronger----”\r\n\r\n    “Is there any prospect of an immediate rise?”\r\n\r\n    “I have never gone into the late-supper business,” the\r\n    commodore answered, apparently not catching the drift of the\r\n    question; “and I have always been a very temperate man. But how\r\n    did you find out that this was my birthday?”\r\n\r\n    “You hinted at the fact yourself,” the reporter replied. “Will\r\n    the Erie troubles----”\r\n\r\n    “The Erie troubles will not prevent me from beginning my\r\n    eighty-second year with a young heart and a clear conscience.”\r\n\r\n    “And with the prospect of seeing a good many more birthday\r\n    anniversaries?” the reporter asked.\r\n\r\n    “That, my dear boy,” said the commodore, “is one of those\r\n    things that no fellow can tell about.”\r\n\r\n    “Do you think that this is a good time to sell?”\r\n\r\n    “No, it’s never a good time to sell after banking-hours.”\r\n\r\n    “Good evening!”\r\n\r\n    “Good evening! Drop in again.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    JULIAN RALPH\r\n]\r\n\r\nHow did the _Sun_ reporters of the seventies compare with those of\r\nlater years? As no two reporters are alike in vision and style, no\r\ntwo occasions identical in incident, no two dramatic moments twin, it\r\nis better to make comparison by choosing arbitrarily scenes far apart\r\nin years, but set on similar stages, and to lay before the reader\r\nthe work of the _Sun_ reporter in each case. Let us take, because of\r\ntheir resemblance in public interest and the similarity of physical\r\nsurroundings, the close of the trials, twenty years apart, of Edward\r\nS. Stokes for the murder of James Fisk, Jr.; of Lizzie Borden for the\r\nkilling of her father and step-mother, and of Charles Becker for the\r\nassassination of Herman Rosenthal.\r\n\r\nThe following is from the _Sun_ of January 6, 1873:\r\n\r\n    Stokes took his accustomed place, and his relatives sat down\r\n    facing the jurors. The judge entered and took his place. Then,\r\n    amid the most solemn silence, the twelve jurymen filed in and\r\n    seated themselves. The awful conclusion at which they had\r\n    arrived could be read in their faces. Each juror’s name was\r\n    called, and with the usual response.\r\n\r\n    The judge turned toward them, and in a low, clear voice asked:\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, have you agreed on a verdict?”\r\n\r\n    The foreman of the jury arose and said, “We have.”\r\n\r\n    Clerk of the Court: “Gentlemen of the jury, rise. Prisoner,\r\n    stand up. Gentlemen of the jury, look upon the prisoner.\r\n    Prisoner, look upon the jury. What say you, gentlemen of the\r\n    jury? Do you find the prisoner at the bar guilty or not guilty?”\r\n\r\n    Foreman of the Jury: “Guilty of murder in the first degree.”\r\n\r\n    A passionate wail that made men’s hearts leap rose from the\r\n    group that clustered round the prisoner, and the head of the\r\n    horror-stricken girl, from whose bosom the anguished cry was\r\n    rent, fell upon the shoulder of her doomed brother.\r\n\r\n    The jury was polled by request of the prisoner’s counsel. No\r\n    sooner had the last man answered “Yes” to the question whether\r\n    all agreed on the verdict than the prisoner, erect and firm,\r\n    turned his face full upon Mr. Beach (of the prosecution), who\r\n    at one time had been his counsel in a civil case.\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Beach,” the prisoner said, slowly and in a full-toned\r\n    voice, “you have done your work well. I hope you have been well\r\n    paid for it.”\r\n\r\n    Then the prisoner sank slowly into his seat. Mr. Beach made\r\n    no reply. Mr. Fellows, assistant district attorney, explained\r\n    that he had refused to try the case unless Mr. Beach and Mr.\r\n    Fullerton were associated with him. They had consented to join\r\n    him at the request of District Attorney Garvin, and without any\r\n    fee from any member of Colonel Fisk’s family.\r\n\r\n    The prisoner half-arose and, sweeping the air with his clenched\r\n    fist, said:\r\n\r\n    “Mr. Fellows, say that they were hired by Jay Gould. Please say\r\n    that!”\r\n\r\n    The sensation in court was such as is seldom known. You could\r\n    hear it as you hear the wind stirring the trees of the forest.\r\n    Then the court discharged the jury and the people began to move.\r\n\r\nThe following was printed in the _Sun_ of June 21, 1893, under date of\r\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts:\r\n\r\n    “Lizzie Andrew Borden,” said the clerk of the court, “stand\r\n    up!”\r\n\r\n    She arose unsteadily, with a face as white as marble.\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen, have you agreed upon a verdict?” said the clerk to\r\n    the jury.\r\n\r\n    It was so still in court that the flutter of two fans made a\r\n    great noise.\r\n\r\n    “We have,” said Foreman Richards boldly.\r\n\r\n    The prisoner was gripping the rail in front of the dock as if\r\n    her standing up depended upon its keeping its place.\r\n\r\n    “Lizzie Andrew Borden,” said the clerk, “hold up your right\r\n    hand. Jurors, look upon the prisoner. Prisoner, look upon the\r\n    foreman.”\r\n\r\n    Every juryman stood at right-about-face, staring at the woman.\r\n    There was such a gentle, kindly light beaming in every eye that\r\n    no one questioned the verdict that was to be uttered. But God\r\n    save every woman from the feelings that Lizzie Borden showed\r\n    in the return look she cast upon that jury! It was what is\r\n    pictured as the rolling gaze of a dying person. She seemed not\r\n    to have the power to move her eyes directly where she was told\r\n    to, and they swung all around in her head. They looked at the\r\n    ceiling; they looked at everything, but they saw nothing. It\r\n    was a horrible, a pitiful sight, to see her then.\r\n\r\n    “What say you, Mr. Foreman?” said the gentle old clerk.\r\n\r\n    “Not guilty!” shouted Mr. Richards.\r\n\r\n    At the words the wretched woman fell quicker than ever an ox\r\n    fell in the stockyards of Chicago. Her forehead crashed against\r\n    the heavy walnut rail so as to shake the reporter of the _Sun_\r\n    who sat next to her, twelve feet away, leaning on the rail.\r\n    It seemed that she must be stunned, but she was not. Quickly,\r\n    with an unconscious movement, she flung up both arms, threw\r\n    them over the rail, and pressed them under her face so that it\r\n    rested on them. What followed was mere mockery, but it was the\r\n    well-governed order of the court and had to be gone through\r\n    with.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, this is from the _Sun_ of May 23, 1914:\r\n\r\n    “Charles Becker to the bar!”\r\n\r\n    Once more the door that gives entrance toward the Tombs as well\r\n    as to the jury-room was opened. A deputy sheriff appeared, then\r\n    Becker, then a second deputy. One glance was all you needed to\r\n    see that Becker had himself under magnificent control. His iron\r\n    nerve was not bending. He swung with long strides around the\r\n    walls and came to a stand at the railing. Those who watched him\r\n    did not see a sign of agitation. He was breathing slowly--you\r\n    could see that from the rise and fall of his powerful\r\n    chest--and smiling slightly as he glanced toward his counsel.\r\n\r\n    He looked for the first time toward the jurors. There was\r\n    confidence and hope shining in his eyes. Coolly, without haste,\r\n    he studied the face of every man in the box. Not one of them\r\n    met his eye. Foreman Blagden gazed at the floor. Frederick G.\r\n    Barrett, Sr., juror No. 12, studied the ceiling. The others\r\n    gazed into space or turned their glance toward the justice.\r\n\r\n    There was the most perfect silence in the court-room. The\r\n    movements of trolley-cars in Centre Street made a noise like\r\n    rolling thunder. A pneumatic riveter at work on a building\r\n    close by set up a tremendous din.\r\n\r\n    And yet such sounds and annoyances were forgotten, ceased to be\r\n    of consequence, when Clerk Penny bent toward the foreman and\r\n    slowly put the customary question:\r\n\r\n    “Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?”\r\n\r\n    Mr. Blagden’s reply was barely audible; many in the room sensed\r\n    its import, but failed to grasp the actual words. It was\r\n    obvious that the foreman, having to express the will of his\r\n    associates, was stirred by such feeling as seldom comes to any\r\n    man.\r\n\r\n    “Guilty as charged in the indictment,” he breathed more than\r\n    spoke.\r\n\r\n    Becker’s right hand was then gripped to the railing. He held\r\n    his straw hat in his left hand, which, as his arm was bent\r\n    backward and upward, rested against the small of his back. It\r\n    is the plain truth that he took the blow without a quiver.\r\n    After a second, it may be, he coughed just a little; a mere\r\n    clearing of the throat. But his mouth was firm. His dark face\r\n    lost no vestige of color. His black eyes turned toward the\r\n    jurymen, who still avoided his glance, who looked everywhere\r\n    but at the man they had condemned.\r\n\r\nIf comment were needed, it would be that the _Sun_ reporter in the\r\ncourt-room at New Bedford had the advantage of describing a protagonist\r\nwho, by her sex and by the very mystery that was left unsolved at her\r\nacquittal, was a far more dramatic figure than Stokes or the police\r\nlieutenant. The climaxes quoted are useful as an illustration of the\r\nadvance of reporting from 1873, when the _Sun_ style was still forming,\r\nto 1893 and 1914, when it was fully formed; not as a comparison between\r\nwhat may not have been the best work of the reporter of the Stokes\r\ntrial, Henry Mann, and the stories by Julian Ralph, who saw Lizzie\r\nBorden fall, and Edwin C. Hill, who wrote the Becker article.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ omitted the weary introductions that had been the fashion in\r\nnewspapers--leading paragraphs which told over again what was in the\r\nhead-lines and were merely a prelude to a third and detailed telling.\r\nThe _Sun_ reporter began at the beginning, thus:\r\n\r\n    The Hon. John Kelly, wearing a small bouquet in the lapel\r\n    of his coat, stepped out of his coach in front of Cardinal\r\n    McCloskey’s residence in Madison Avenue just before eight\r\n    o’clock yesterday morning. A few minutes later three other\r\n    coaches arrived, and their occupants entered the house. Many\r\n    of the neighbors knew that a niece of the cardinal was to be\r\n    married to Mr. Kelly, and they strained their eyes through\r\n    plate-glass windows in the hope that they might see the bride\r\n    and the groom. Cardinal McCloskey, having been apprized of the\r\n    arrival of the wedding-party, went to the chapel in the other\r\n    part of the house, and at about a quarter past eight, the time\r\n    fixed for the mass _pro sponsis_, the marriage ceremony was\r\n    begun.\r\n\r\nIn the longer and more important stories, the rule was adhered to as\r\nclosely as possible. Prolixity, fine writing, and hysteria were taboo.\r\nMark the calmness with which the _Sun_ reporter began his story of the\r\nmost sensational crime of the late seventies:\r\n\r\n    Two little mounds of red-colored earth around a small hole in\r\n    the ground, and a few feet of downtrodden grass, were all that\r\n    marked the last resting-place of Alexander T. Stewart yesterday\r\n    morning. In the dead of the night robbers had dug into the\r\n    earth above the vault, removed one of the stones that covered\r\n    it, and stolen the body of the dead millionaire.\r\n\r\nThe human lights of life were caught by the _Sun_ men and transferred\r\nto every page of every issue. In 1878 a _Sun_ reporter was sent to\r\nMenlo Park, New Jersey, to see how a young inventor there, who had just\r\nannounced the possibility of an incandescent electric light, worked:\r\n\r\n    Here Mr. Edison dropped his cigar-stump from his mouth, and,\r\n    turning to Griffin, asked for some chewing-tobacco. The private\r\n    secretary drew open his drawer and passed out a yellow cake as\r\n    large as a dinner-plate. The professor tore away a chew, saying:\r\n\r\n    “I am partly indebted to the _Sun_ for this tobacco. It printed\r\n    an article saying that I chewed poor tobacco. That was so. The\r\n    Lorillards saw the article and sent me down a box of the best\r\n    plug that ever went into a man’s mouth. All the workmen have\r\n    used it, and Grif says there is a marked moral improvement in\r\n    the men. It seems, however, to have the opposite effect on\r\n    Grif. You see that he has salted away the last cake for his own\r\n    use.”\r\n\r\nNearly forty years later _Sun_ reporters still went to see Mr. Edison\r\nborrow white magic from nature and chewing-tobacco from his employees,\r\nand to describe both interesting processes.\r\n\r\nWith Dana’s knowledge of what people wanted to read was mixed a\r\ncuriosity, sometimes frankly expressed in the _Sun_, as to just why\r\nthey wanted to read some things a great deal more than other things.\r\nIt must be remembered that even in the seventies and eighties not\r\neverybody read a newspaper every day; some reserved their pennies\r\nand their eyes for great climaxes. The _Sun_, a paper which paid\r\nmuch attention to political matters, naturally found its circulation\r\nsharply affected by important political happenings. It sold ninety-four\r\nthousand extra copies on the morning after the Tilden-Hayes\r\nelection--two hundred and twenty-two thousand copies, in all, being\r\ndisposed of before eight o’clock in the morning. In 1875, when the\r\npugilist, John Morrissey, who was supported by the _Sun_ for the State\r\nSenate because he was anti-Tammany, defeated Fox, the _Sun_ sold\r\nforty-nine thousand extra copies on the day after the election.\r\n\r\nThe assassination of the Czar Alexander II of Russia did not sell an\r\nextra paper, but the hanging of Foster, the “car-hook murderer,” sent\r\nthe sales up seventeen thousand. The deaths of Cornelius Vanderbilt\r\nand Alexander T. Stewart had no effect on the _Sun’s_ circulation, the\r\npassing of Napoleon III raised it only one thousand for the day, and\r\nthe death of Pius IX caused only four thousand irregular readers to\r\nbuy the paper; but the execution of Dolan, a murderer now practically\r\nforgotten, sent the sales up ten thousand. The beginning of coercive\r\nmeasures in Ireland by the arrest of Michael Davitt sold no extra\r\npapers in a city full of Irishmen, but the Fenian invasion of Canada\r\nmeant the sale of ten thousand copies more than usual.\r\n\r\nTweed’s death caused an increase of five thousand; the death of\r\nPresident Garfield, of seventy-four thousand. Only thirteen thousand\r\nextras were sold after the Brooklyn Theatre fire, while the Westfield\r\nsteamboat explosion sold thirty-one thousand. Twenty-one thousand\r\nirregular readers bought the _Sun_ to read about the first blasting of\r\nHell Gate in 1876, while only eight thousand were interested in the\r\nfact that Tilden had been counted out by the Electoral Commission.\r\nThe flare-up of the Beecher scandal, in August, 1874, sold as many\r\nextras--ten thousand--as the shooting of Fisk.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the Crédit Mobilier exposé added only a thousand to\r\nthe normal circulation, but on the morning after a big walking-match\r\nthe presses had to run off forty thousand more than their usual daily\r\ngrist. The resignation of Roscoe Conkling and Thomas C. Platt from the\r\nUnited States Senate hoisted the circulation only two thousand, but\r\nthe fight between John L. Sullivan and Paddy Ryan meant a difference\r\nof eleven thousand. The opening of the Centennial Exposition in\r\nPhiladelphia caused extra sales of three thousand; an international\r\nrifle-match at Creedmoor, ten thousand.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 the _Sun_ made the calculation that the average effect of\r\ncertain sorts of news in increase of circulation was about as follows:\r\n\r\n  Presidential elections                                  82,000\r\n  State and city elections                                42,000\r\n  Last days of walking-matches                            25,000\r\n  October State elections in Presidential years           21,000\r\n  Great fires                                             10,000\r\n  Notable disasters                                        9,000\r\n  Hangings in or near New York                             8,000\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ expressed a curiosity to know--\r\n\r\n    Who are the eighty or ninety thousand people, not regular\r\n    readers of the _Sun_, that buy the paper after a Presidential\r\n    election? Where do they live? Do they read the papers only\r\n    after exciting events?\r\n\r\nOn its fiftieth birthday--September 3, 1883--the _Sun_ printed a table\r\nshowing the high-tide marks of its circulation:\r\n\r\n  November 8, 1876--Presidential election                222,390\r\n  Sept. 20, 1881--Garfield’s death                       212,525\r\n  Nov. 3, 1880--Presidential election                    206,974\r\n  July 13, 1871--Orange riots                            192,224\r\n  Sept. 21, 1881--Second day after Garfield’s death      180,215\r\n  Nov. 3, 1875--State and city election                  177,588\r\n  July 3, 1881--Garfield shot                            176,093\r\n\r\nIn the same article, a page review written by Mr. Mitchell, the reasons\r\nfor the _Sun’s_ success were succinctly given:\r\n\r\n    No waste of words, no nonsense, plain, outspoken expressions of\r\n    honest opinion, the abolishment of the conventional measures of\r\n    news importance, the substitution of the absolute standard of\r\n    real interest to human beings, bright and enjoyable writing,\r\n    wit, philosophical good humor, intolerance of humbug, hard\r\n    hitting from the shoulder on proper occasions--do we not see\r\n    all these qualities now in our esteemed contemporaries on every\r\n    side of us, and in every part of the land?\r\n\r\nBy this time Dana had framed a newspaper organisation more nearly\r\nperfect than any other in America. Grouping about him men suited to\r\nthe _Sun_, to himself, and to one another, he had created a literary\r\nworld of his own--a seeing, thinking, writing world of keen objective\r\nvision. Men of a hundred various minds, each with his own style, his\r\nown ambition, his own manner of life, the _Sun_ staff focused their\r\nabilities into the one flood of light that came out every morning. It\r\nwas a bohemia of brightness, not of beer; unconventional in its manner\r\nof seeing and writing, but not in its collars or its way of living. The\r\n_Sun_ spirit, unquenchable then as now, burned in every corner of the\r\nshabby old rooms. It was the spirit of unselfish devotion, not so much\r\nto Dana or his likable lieutenants as to the invisible god of a machine\r\nin which each man was a pinion, meshing smoothly with his neighbour.\r\n\r\nThat these pinions did mesh without friction was due, in largest part,\r\nto Dana’s intuitive faculty of choosing men who would “fit in” rather\r\nthan men who could merely write. It was by his choosing that the _Sun_\r\ncame to have for its editorial page writers like W. O. Bartlett and\r\nE. P. Mitchell, M. W. Hazeltine and N. L. Thiéblin, Henry B. Stanton\r\nand John Swinton, James S. Pike and Fitz-Henry Warren, Paul Dana and\r\nThomas Hitchcock, Francis P. Church and E. M. Kingsbury. It was by\r\nhis choosing that the Sun had managing editors like Amos J. Cummings\r\nand Chester S. Lord, city editors like John B. Bogart and Daniel F.\r\nKellogg, and night city editors like Henry W. Odion, Ambrose W. Lyman,\r\nand S. M. Clarke.\r\n\r\nManaging editors and city editors hired men, hundreds of them, but\r\nalways according to the Dana plan--first find the man, then find the\r\nwork for him. Chester S. Lord, who took more men on the _Sun_ than\r\nany other of its executives, was fully familiar with the Dana method\r\nwhen he began, in 1880, a career as managing editor that lasted for\r\nthirty-two years of brilliant achievement; and he followed it until he\r\nretired. He had been on the _Sun_ since 1872, shortly after he came\r\nout of Hamilton College, and he had served as a reporter, as editor\r\nof suburban news, as assistant night city editor under Lyman, and\r\nas assistant managing editor in the brief period when Ballard Smith\r\nsucceeded Cummings and Young as chief of the _Sun’s_ news department.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his service as managing editor Lord found himself\r\nwith a staff which included Bogart, Dr. Wood, Stillman, Odion, E. M.\r\nRewey, Garrett P. Serviss, and Cyrus C. Adams, all trained desk men and\r\nmost of them good reporters as well; and such first-class reporters and\r\ncorrespondents as Julian Ralph, S. S. Carvalho, Willis Holly, and E. J.\r\nEdwards. To these, by the time the _Sun_ reached its half-century mark,\r\nhad been added the great night city editor Clarke and reporters like\r\nJohn R. Spears and Arthur Brisbane. Other great newspapermen were soon\r\nto join the army of Mr. Lord in that long campaign of which the editor\r\nof the _Sun_ said, on the occasion of Mr. Lord’s retirement:\r\n\r\n    Every night of his ten thousand nights of service has been a\r\n    Trafalgar or a Waterloo. He has fought ten thousand battles\r\n    against the world, the flesh, and the devil; the woman\r\n    applicant, the refractory citizen, the liar at the other end of\r\n    the wire, and the ten thousand demons which make up the great\r\n    army of nervous prostration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n“SUN” REPORTERS AND THEIR WORK\r\n\r\n  _Cummings, Ralph, W. J. Chamberlin, Brisbane, Riggs, Dieuaide,\r\n    Spears, O. K. Davis, Irwin, Adams, Denison, Wood, O’Malley, Hill,\r\n    Cronyn.--Spanish War Work._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an unconventional club which has no home except on the one\r\nnight each year when it holds a dinner in a New York hotel. Its members\r\nare men who have been writers on the _Sun_, and who, though they have\r\nleft the paper, love it. They meet for no purpose except to toast the\r\n_Sun_ of their day and this. They call themselves the Sun Alumni.\r\n\r\nFrom the ranks of the novelists and magazine editors and writers come\r\nmen like Will Irwin, Samuel Hopkins Adams, Robert Welles Ritchie,\r\nAlbert W. Atwood, Henry James Forman, Cameron Mackenzie, Kirk Munroe,\r\nCharles Mason Fairbanks, Robert R. Whiting, James L. Ford, E. J.\r\nEdwards, Arthur F. Aldridge, George B. Mallon, Gustav Kobbé, and\r\nFrederick Kinney Noyes.\r\n\r\nFrom the lists of newspaper owners and editors come Arthur Brisbane,\r\nof the Washington _Times_; Edward H. Mott, of the Goshen _Republican_;\r\nFrank H. Simonds, of the New York _Tribune_; Martin J. Hutchins, of the\r\nChicago _Journal_; C. L. Sherman, of the Hartford _Courant_.\r\n\r\nFrom the staffs of other New York newspapers come Charles Selden, Carr\r\nV. Van Anda, and Richard V. Oulahan, of the _Times_; William A. Willis,\r\nof the _Herald_; Rudolph E. Block, of the _American_; J. Arthur\r\nSeavey, of the _Tribune_; and Lindsay Denison, of the _Evening World_.\r\n\r\nFrom the bench come Judges Willard Bartlett, Warren W. Foster, and\r\nWillard H. Olmsted; from government work, Stephen T. Mather, Robert\r\nSterling Yard, and E. W. Townsend; from business, Edward G. Riggs,\r\nWillis Holly, Collin Armstrong, Oscar King Davis, Robert Grier Cooke,\r\nJohn H. O’Brien, and Roy Mason. If the racing season is over in Cuba,\r\nC. J. Fitzgerald is present. If business on the San Diego _Sun_ is not\r\ntoo brisk, its editor, Clarence McGrew, crosses the continent to be\r\nat the feast. Until his death in 1917, Franklin Matthews, associate\r\nprofessor of journalism at Columbia University, who was with the _Sun_\r\nfrom 1890 to 1909 in many capacities, was one of the leading spirits of\r\nthe Alumni. Dr. Talcott Williams, chief of the school of journalism, is\r\nanother enthusiastic alumnus.\r\n\r\nThese men, the outsider observes, gather and talk in groups. The men of\r\nthe eighties recall the wonders of the four-page _Sun_ and its Bogarts,\r\nRalphs, and Cummingses. Men of the nineties chat of the feats of\r\n“Jersey” Chamberlin and “Commodore” Spears. The alumni who matriculated\r\nin the present century speak of Riggs and Irwin, Denison and O’Malley\r\nand Hill. But all talk of the _Sun_, and of Dana and Mitchell and Lord\r\nand Clarke.\r\n\r\nIt is only when they speak of reporters that there is a grouping of\r\nheroes. That is because it is a natural and pleasant practice, if an\r\nillogical one, for newspapermen of the present and previous decades to\r\nlook back to this or that period of a paper and say:\r\n\r\n“That was _the_ day! The names of the men on the staff prove it.”\r\n\r\nAn old _Sun_ man will point, for instance, to the _Sun’s_ roster of\r\nreporters in 1893, when the local staff included:\r\n\r\n  Julian Ralph\r\n  John R. Spears\r\n  Oscar K. Davis\r\n  C. J. Fitzgerald\r\n  Carr V. Van Anda\r\n  David Graham Phillips\r\n  George B. Mallon\r\n  Samuel Hopkins Adams\r\n  Daniel F. Kellogg\r\n  C. M. Fairbanks\r\n  Lawrence Reamer\r\n  W. J. Chamberlin\r\n  Edward G. Riggs\r\n  E. W. Townsend\r\n  Rudolph E. Block\r\n  Samuel A. Wood\r\n  E. D. Beach\r\n  E. O. Chamberlin\r\n  Victor Speer\r\n  Joseph Vila\r\n  W. A. Willis\r\n  Collin Armstrong\r\n\r\nThe weak place in this sort of retrospection is that after twenty-five\r\nyears the observer’s focus is twisted. Julian Ralph was a great\r\nreporter in 1893, but W. J. Chamberlin, whose name is linked with\r\nRalph’s among great _Sun_ reporters, was only just arriving. John\r\nR. Spears had made his reputation, but Riggs’s fame as a political\r\nwriter was not yet established. Townsend had tickled New York with his\r\n“Chimmie Fadden” stories, but Sam Adams was a cub. Wood, Vila, and\r\nReamer were not as important to the _Sun_ in 1893 as they are at this\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nThe men of 1893 probably agreed that there was no staff like the\r\nstaff of 1868, just as the men of 1942 may gaze with proud regret at\r\nthe staff list of 1917. Distance, like pay-day, lends enchantment;\r\nand newspaper history is a little more hazy than most other kinds of\r\nhistory, because the men who write what happens to other people have no\r\ntime to set down what happens to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe anonymity of the _Sun_ reporter has been almost complete. If\r\nJulian Ralph had never gone into the field of books and magazines, he\r\nwould have been as little known to the general public as the _Sun’s_\r\nbest reporter is to-day; but newspapermen would not have undervalued\r\nhim. There is better quality in the things he wrote hastily and\r\nanonymously for the _Sun_ than in some of the eight or nine published\r\nvolumes that bear his name, and the reason for this is that he was\r\nprimarily a newspaperman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    ARTHUR BRISBANE\r\n]\r\n\r\nHe entered the game at fifteen, as an apprentice in the office of the\r\nRed Bank (New Jersey) _Standard_. At seventeen he was a city editor and\r\na writer of humour. At eighteen he had founded the Red Bank _Leader_--a\r\nfailure. At nineteen he was one of the editors of the Webster\r\n(Massachusetts) _Times_, and at twenty he was a reporter on the New\r\nYork _Graphic_. At twenty-two he was on the _Sun_, where he remained\r\nfrom 1875 to 1893.\r\n\r\nRalph was a news man who lacked none of the large reportorial\r\nqualities. He enjoyed seeing new places and new people. He liked to\r\nhunt news--an instinct missing in some good writers who fail to be\r\ngreat reporters. He liked to write--a taste found too seldom among\r\nmen who write well, and too frequently among the graphomaniacs who\r\nfancy that everything is worth writing, and that perfection lies in an\r\ninfinite number of words.\r\n\r\nSome one said of Ralph that he “could write five thousand words about\r\na cobblestone.” If he had done that, it would have been an interesting\r\ncobblestone. He had a passion for detail, but it was not the lifeless\r\nand wearisome detail of the realistic novelist. When he wrote half\r\na column about a horse eating a woman’s hat, the reader became well\r\nacquainted with the horse, the woman, and the crowd that had looked on.\r\n\r\nRalph was untiring in mind, legs, and fingers. He liked the big one-man\r\nnews story, such as an inauguration or a parade, or the general\r\nintroduction of a national convention. His quiet, easy style, his\r\nability to cover an event of many hours and much territory, were shown\r\nto good advantage in his description of the funeral of General Grant\r\nin August, 1885. He wrote it all--a full front page of small type--in\r\nabout seven hours, and with a pencil. It began:\r\n\r\n    There have not often been gathered in one place so many men\r\n    whose names have been household words, and whose lives have\r\n    been inwoven with the history of a grave crisis in a great\r\n    nation’s life, as met yesterday in this city. The scene was\r\n    before General Grant’s tomb in Riverside Park; the space was\r\n    less than goes to half an ordinary city block, and the names\r\n    of the actors were William T. Sherman, Joe Johnston, Phil\r\n    Sheridan, Simon B. Buckner, John A. Logan, W. S. Hancock, Fitz\r\n    John Porter, Chester A. Arthur, Thomas A. Hendricks, John\r\n    Sherman, Fitzhugh Lee, John B. Gordon, David D. Porter, Thomas\r\n    F. Bayard, John L. Worden, and a dozen others naturally linked\r\n    in the mind with these greater men. Among them, like children\r\n    amid gray-heads, or shadows beside monuments, were other men\r\n    more newly famous, and famous only for deeds of peace in times\r\n    of quiet and plenty--a President, an ex-President, Governors,\r\n    mayors, and millionaires. And all were paying homage to the\r\n    greatest figure of their time, whose mortal remains they\r\n    pressed around with bared, bowed heads.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of a story of about eleven thousand words, all\r\nwritten by Ralph in one evening. It told everything that was worth\r\nreading about the burial--the weather, the crowded line of march, the\r\npeople from out of town, the women fainting at the curbs, the uniforms\r\nand peculiarities of the Union and Confederate heroes who rode in the\r\nfuneral train; told everything from eight o’clock in the morning,\r\nwhen the sightseers began to gather, until the bugler blew taps and\r\nthe regiments fired their salute volleys. It was a story typical of\r\nRalph, who saw everything, remembered everything, wrote everything. In\r\ndetail it is unlikely that any reporter of to-day could surpass it. In\r\ndramatic quality it has been excelled by half a dozen _Sun_ reporters,\r\nincluding Ralph himself.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is the story of a similar event--Admiral Dewey’s\r\nfuneral--written in January, 1917, by Thoreau Cronyn, of the _Sun_,\r\nwith a dramatic climax such as Ralph did not reach. This is the end of\r\nCronyn’s story--the incident of the old bugler whose art failed him in\r\nhis grief:\r\n\r\n    Chattering of spectators in the background hushed abruptly. A\r\n    light breeze, which barely rumpled the river, set a few dry\r\n    leaves tossing about the tomb of Farragut, Dewey’s mentor at\r\n    Mobile. The voice of Chaplain Frazier could be heard repeating\r\n    a prayer, catching, and then going on smoothly.\r\n\r\n    A second of silence, then the brisk call of the lieutenant\r\n    commanding the firing-squad of Annapolis cadets.\r\n\r\n    “Load!”\r\n\r\n    Rifles rattling.\r\n\r\n    “Aim!”\r\n\r\n    Rifles pointed a little upward for safety’s sake, though the\r\n    cartridges had no bullets.\r\n\r\n    “Fire!”\r\n\r\n    Twenty rifles snapped as one. This twice repeated--three\r\n    volleys over the tomb into which the twelve sailors had just\r\n    carried the admiral’s body.\r\n\r\n    And now came the moment for Master-at-Arms Charles Mitchell,\r\n    bugler on the Olympia when Dewey sank the Spanish fleet, to\r\n    perform his last office for the admiral. Raising the bugle to\r\n    his lips and looking straight ahead at the still open door of\r\n    the tomb, he sounded “taps.” The first three climbing notes and\r\n    the second three were perfect. Then the break and the recovery,\r\n    and the funeral was over.\r\n\r\nJulian Ralph saw more of the world, and made more copy out of what he\r\nsaw, than any other newspaperman. While still on the _Sun_ he was\r\nmaking books out of the material he picked up on his assignments. In\r\nthe early nineties, while still on the _Sun_ staff, he made two tours\r\nfor _Harper’s Magazine_ and wrote “On Canada’s Frontier,” “Our Great\r\nWest,” and “Chicago and the World’s Fair,” the last of which was the\r\nofficial book of the Columbian Exposition. After his experiences in the\r\nBoer War he wrote “Towards Pretoria,” “War’s Brighter Side” (with Conan\r\nDoyle), and “An American with Lord Roberts.” His other books are “Alone\r\nin China,” “Dixie; or, Southern Scenes and Sketches,” “People We Pass,”\r\nand a novel, “The Millionairess.” He was the author of the “German\r\nBarber” sketches, which appeared almost weekly in the _Sun_ for a long\r\ntime, and which are remembered as among the genuine examples of real\r\nhumour in dialect. During the Boer War, Ralph joined the staff of the\r\nLondon _Daily Mail_, and after returning from South Africa he made his\r\nhome in London until his death in 1903.\r\n\r\nA tradition about Ralph, indicating the pleasure that his articles\r\ngave to his own colleagues as well as to the public, concerns one\r\nof the great football-games of the eighties. John Spears discovered\r\nthe picturesqueness of the Yale-Princeton games, usually played\r\non Thanksgiving Day, and the _Sun_ featured them year after year.\r\nReporters hungered for the job, for it meant not only money, but the\r\nopportunity to write a fine story.\r\n\r\nWhen Ralph’s turn came he wrote such a good article that the copy-desk\r\nlet it run for five columns. Lord admired it, Clarke was enthusiastic\r\nover it, and the other men in the office took turns in reading the\r\nstory in the proofs, so happily was it turned. It was not until the\r\nfirst edition was off the press that an underling, who cared more for\r\nfootball than for literature, suggested that the story ought to contain\r\nthe score of the game. Ralph had forgotten to state it, and all the\r\ndesks, absorbed in the thrill of the article itself, had overlooked the\r\nomission.\r\n\r\nRalph reported for the _Sun_ the outrages of the Molly Maguires in the\r\nPennsylvania coal-fields. After the execution of two of the outlaws for\r\nmurder, he was bold enough to follow their bodies back to their village\r\nwhere they had lived, in order to describe the wake. He was warned to\r\nleave the place before sunset, on pain of death, and he went, for there\r\nwas nothing to be gained by staying.\r\n\r\nOn another assignment, a murder mystery, the relatives of the victim,\r\nwho were ignorant and superstitious people, suspected Ralph of being\r\nthe murderer. When he came into their house to see the body, they\r\ndemanded that he should touch it, their belief being that the body\r\nwould turn over, or the wounds reopen, if touched by the murderer.\r\nThere was an implied threat of death for the reporter if he refused,\r\nbut Ralph walked out without complying.\r\n\r\nRalph was a believer in the sixth sense of journalists, that\r\ninexplicable gift by which a man, and particularly a newspaperman,\r\ncomes to a clairvoyant knowledge that something is about to happen--in\r\nother words, an exalted hunch. John B. Bogart, city editor in Ralph’s\r\n_Sun_ days, had this sense, and he called it a “current of news.” He\r\nthus described its workings to Ralph:\r\n\r\n    One day I was walking up Broadway when suddenly a current\r\n    of news came up from a cellar and enveloped me. I felt the\r\n    difference in the temperature of the air. I tingled with the\r\n    electricity or magnetism in the current. It seemed to stop me,\r\n    to turn me around, and to force me to descend some stairs which\r\n    reached up to the street by my side.\r\n\r\n    I ran down the steps, and as I did so a pistol-shot sounded in\r\n    my ears. One man had shot another, and I found myself at the\r\n    scene upon the instant.\r\n\r\nWhile acting as the legislative correspondent of the _Sun_ at Albany,\r\nRalph was in the habit of walking to one of the local parks to enjoy\r\nthe view across a valley southwest of the city. One day, while gazing\r\nacross the valley, he was seized with a desire to go to the mountains\r\nin the distance beyond it. The impulse remained with him for two days,\r\nand then, on the third day, he read of a news happening that had\r\noccurred in the mountains on the very day when the current of news had\r\nthrilled him.\r\n\r\nRalph reported the Dreyfus court-martial at Rennes, in France. One\r\nmorning he could not sleep after five o’clock. As he was on his way to\r\ncourt he said to George W. Steevens, of the London _Daily Mail_, who\r\nwas walking with him:\r\n\r\n“Wait a moment while I go into the telegraph office and wire my paper\r\nthat I expect exciting news to-day.”\r\n\r\nAt that hour there was no apparent reason to expect any news out of\r\nthe ordinary, but it was only a few hours later that Maître Labori,\r\nDreyfus’s counsel, was shot down on his way to court.\r\n\r\nYoung newspapermen who are fortunate enough to be possessed of--or\r\nby--the sixth sense must remember, however, that it cannot be relied\r\nupon to sound the alarm on every occasion. Mr. Bogart, who felt that\r\nhe had a friend in the current of news, kept close track of the\r\nassignment-book. As a city editor he was unsurpassed for his diligence\r\nin following up news stories. One day he assigned Brainerd G. Smith,\r\nafterward professor of journalism at Cornell, to report the first\r\nreception given by Judge Hilton after the death of the judge’s partner,\r\nA. T. Stewart.\r\n\r\n“And above all,” Mr. Bogart wound up, “don’t leave the house without\r\nasking Judge Hilton whether they’ve found Stewart’s body yet.”\r\n\r\nJulian Ralph attributed his success as a journalist chiefly to three\r\nthings--a liking for his work, the ability to get what he was sent for,\r\nand good humour. He omitted mention of something which distinguished\r\nhim and Chamberlin and all other great reporters--hard work. Ralph\r\nhimself gives a brief but complete picture of a day’s hard work in his\r\ndescription, in “The Making of a Journalist,” of the way in which he\r\nreported the inauguration of a President:\r\n\r\n    I had myself called at five o’clock in the morning, and, having\r\n    a cab at hand, mounted the box with the negro driver and\r\n    traveled about the city from end to end and side to side. I did\r\n    this to see the people get up and the trains roll in and the\r\n    soldiers turn out--to catch the capital robing like a bride for\r\n    her wedding.\r\n\r\n    After breakfast, eaten calmly, I made another tour of the\r\n    town, and then began to approach the subject more closely,\r\n    calling at the White House, mingling with the crowds in the\r\n    principal hotels, moving between the Senate and the House of\r\n    Representatives, to report the hurly-burly of the closing\r\n    moments of a dying administration. I saw the old and the new\r\n    President, and then witnessed the inauguration ceremonies and\r\n    the parade.\r\n\r\n    Then, having seen the new family in place in the White House, I\r\n    took a hearty luncheon, and sat down at half past one o’clock\r\n    to write steadily for twelve hours, with plenty of pencils\r\n    and pads and messenger-boys at hand, and with my notebook\r\n    supplemented by clippings from all the afternoon papers,\r\n    covering details to which I might or might not wish to refer.\r\n    Cigars, a sandwich or two at supper-time, and a stout horn of\r\n    brandy late at night were my other equipments.\r\n\r\nAs Ralph remarked, that was hard work, but it was nothing when compared\r\nwith the job of reporting a national convention. “One needs only to\r\n_see_ an inauguration,” he said. “In a national convention one must\r\n_know_.”\r\n\r\nWilbur J. Chamberlin’s name is not in any book of American biography.\r\nIn library indexes his name is found only as the author of “Ordered\r\nto China,” a series of letters he wrote to his wife while on the\r\nassignment to report the Boxer rebellion--one of the many pieces of\r\n_Sun_ work which he did faithfully and well. He never found time to\r\nwrite books, although he wished to do so. He was a _Sun_ man from the\r\nday he went on the staff, in 1890, until the day of his death, August\r\n14, 1901.\r\n\r\nChamberlin was born in Great Bend, Pennsylvania, March 12, 1866. While\r\nhe was still a boy he went to Jersey City, where he worked in newspaper\r\noffices and became the local correspondent of several newspapers,\r\nincluding the _Sun_. He came to be known as “Jersey” Chamberlin to\r\nthe _Sun_ men who did not know how much he detested the nickname.\r\nHis intimates called him Wilbur, and the office knew him generally\r\nas “W. J.”--an easy way of distinguishing him from other Chamberlins\r\nand Chamberlains. He lacked Ralph’s rather distinguished personal\r\nappearance, but his strong personality, his courage, ability, and\r\nindustry overshadowed any lack of fashion.\r\n\r\nLike Ralph, he was indefatigable. Like his brother, E. O. Chamberlin,\r\nhe let nothing stop him in the pursuit of news. Like Henry R.\r\nChamberlain, he had the gift of divining rapidly the necessary details\r\nof any intricate business with which his assignment dealt. If a bank\r\ncashier had gone wrong, “W. J.” was the man to describe how the sinner\r\nhad manœuvred the theft; to wring from usually unwilling sources the\r\nstory which appeared in the bank only in figures, but which must appear\r\nin the _Sun_ in terms of human life. The world of finance was more\r\ndumb then than it is now, for Wall Street had not learned the wisdom of\r\nuttering its own pitiless publicity.\r\n\r\nChamberlin had one idiosyncrasy and one hatred. The mental peculiarity\r\nwas a wish to conceal his own age. Unlike most successful men, he\r\nwished to be thought older than he was; and he looked older. He was\r\nonly thirty-five when he died in Carlsbad, on his way home from China;\r\nyet he had packed into that brief life the work of an industrious man\r\nof fifty.\r\n\r\nHis single enmity was directed against cable companies, and he had good\r\nreason to dislike them. One day, during the Spanish-American War he\r\nboarded the _Sun_ boat, the Kanapaha, and ran to Port Antonio, Jamaica,\r\nwith an exclusive story. The women clerks in the telegraph office took\r\nhis despatch and counted the words three times before they would start\r\nsending it. They told Chamberlin the cost, about a hundred dollars,\r\nwhich he promptly paid in cash.\r\n\r\nThree or four days later he went back to Port Antonio with another\r\nimportant despatch. The cable clerk told him that on his previous visit\r\ntheir count had been one word short.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right,” said Chamberlin, and he threw down a shilling to\r\npay for the one word.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said the lady. “_Now_ we can send the message!”\r\n\r\nThe cable hoodoo pursued Chamberlin to China. As soon as he arrived\r\nin Peking he began sending important news stories by telegraph to\r\nTientsin, where he had left a deposit of three hundred dollars with\r\nthe cable company that was to forward the messages to New York. After\r\nworking in Peking for two weeks, he discovered that all his stories\r\nwere lying in a pigeonhole at Tientsin; not one had been relayed.\r\n\r\nA third time an important despatch was held up overnight because it had\r\nnot been written on a regular telegraph-blank. But Chamberlin’s most\r\nbitter grudge against the cable companies was the result of his adding\r\nto a message sent to the _Sun_ on Christmas Eve, 1900, the words “Madam\r\nChristmas greeting.” This was a short way of saying, “Please call\r\nup Mrs. Chamberlin and tell her that I wish her a Merry Christmas.”\r\nUnder the cable company’s rules nothing could be sent at the special\r\nnewspaper rate except what was intended for publication. Chamberlin got\r\na despatch from the manager of the cable company as follows:\r\n\r\n    Your cable _Sun_ New York December 24 words “Madam Christmas\r\n    greeting” not intended for publication. Please explain.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for Chamberlin to do but assure the cable manager\r\nthat if the _Sun_ had wished to print “Madam Christmas greeting” in its\r\ncolumns it was welcome to do so.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his cable misfortunes Chamberlin got more news to the _Sun_\r\nabout the Boxer troubles than any other correspondent obtained. He was\r\nthe first reporter in China who told the truth about the outrageous\r\ntreatment of the Chinese by some of the so-called Christians. He was\r\nparticularly frank in describing the brutality of Count von Waldersee’s\r\nGerman soldiers. In November, 1900, he wrote to his wife:\r\n\r\n    As you have probably noticed in my despatches, I have not much\r\n    use for the German soldiers anyhow. They are a big lot of\r\n    swine, if human beings ever are swine.\r\n\r\nChamberlin had a reputation for possessing the ability to write any\r\nkind of a story, no matter how technical or how delicate. Edward G.\r\nRiggs was sitting beside him in the Populist convention of July, 1896,\r\nwhen the suspenders of the sergeant-at-arms of the convention, who was\r\nstanding on a chair, cheering, surrendered to cataclasm. Riggs turned\r\nto his colleague and said triumphantly:\r\n\r\n“At last, W. J., there’s one story you can’t write!”\r\n\r\nBut Chamberlin wrote it:\r\n\r\n    He clutched, but he clutched too late. He dived and grabbed\r\n    once, twice, thrice, but down those trousers slipped. Mary\r\n    E. Lease was only three feet away. Miss Mitchell, of Kansas,\r\n    was less than two feet away. Helen Gougar was almost on the\r\n    spot. Mrs. Julia Ward Pennington was just two seats off, and\r\n    all around and about him were gathered the most beautiful and\r\n    eloquent women of the convention, and every eye was upon the\r\n    unfortunate Deacon McDowell.\r\n\r\n    Then he grabbed, and then again, again, and again they eluded\r\n    him. Down, down he dived. At last victory perched on him. He\r\n    got the trousers, and, with a yank that threatened to rip them\r\n    from stem to stern, he pulled them up. At no time had the\r\n    applause ceased, nor had there been any sign of a let-up in the\r\n    demonstration. Now it was increased twofold. The women joined\r\n    in.\r\n\r\n    McDowell, clutching the truant trousers closely about him,\r\n    attempted to resume his part in the demonstration, but it\r\n    was useless, and after frantic efforts to show enthusiasm\r\n    he retired to hunt up tenpenny nails. When it was over, an\r\n    indignant Populist introduced this resolution:\r\n\r\n    “Resolved, that future sergeants-at-arms shall be required to\r\n    wear tights.”\r\n\r\n    The chairman did not put the resolution.\r\n\r\nThe number of Chamberlains and Chamberlins in the history of American\r\njournalism is enough to create confusion. The _Sun_ alone had four at\r\none time. They were Wilbur J. Chamberlin and his almost equally valued\r\nbrother, Ernest O. Chamberlin, who later became managing editor of the\r\n_Evening World_; Henry Richardson Chamberlain, and Henry B. Chamberlin.\r\n\r\nE. O. Chamberlin went on the _Sun’s_ local staff while Wilbur was still\r\nengaged in small work in Jersey City. In the late eighties he was a\r\ncolabourer with reporters like Daniel F. Kellogg, Edward G. Riggs,\r\nWilliam McMurtrie Speer, Charles W. Tyler, Robert Sterling Yard, Samuel\r\nA. Wood, Paul Drane, and Willis Holly.\r\n\r\nHenry Richardson Chamberlain, who was born in Peoria, Illinois, became\r\na _Sun_ reporter in May, 1889. He was then thirty years old, and had\r\nhad twelve years’ experience in Boston and New York. In 1888 he had\r\nserved as managing editor of the New York _Press_. He was particularly\r\nvaluable to the _Sun_ on the stories most easily obtained by reporters\r\nof wide acquaintance, such as business disasters. In 1891 he returned\r\nto Boston to become managing editor of the Boston _Journal_, but he was\r\nsoon back on the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 he was sent to London as the _Sun’s_ correspondent there,\r\nand it was at this post that he won his greatest distinction. He had\r\na news eye that looked out over political Europe and an imagination\r\nthat compelled him to concern himself as much with the future of the\r\ncontinent as with its past and present. The Balkans and their feuds\r\ninterested him strongly, and he was forever writing of what might come\r\nfrom the complications between the little states through their own\r\nquarrels and through their tangled relations with the powers. It was\r\nthe habit of some newspapermen, both in London and New York, to stick\r\ntheir tongues in their cheeks over “H. R. C.’s war-cloud articles.”\r\n\r\n“H. R. is always seeing things,” was a common remark, even when the\r\nlogic of what he had written was undeniable. There couldn’t be a\r\ngeneral war in Europe, said his critics, kindly; it was impossible.\r\n\r\nBesides having general supervision over the _Sun’s_ European news,\r\nChamberlain personally reported the Macedonian disturbances, the Panama\r\nCanal scandal in France, the Russian crisis of 1906, and the Messina\r\nearthquake. He was the author of many short stories and of one book,\r\n“Six Thousand Tons of Gold.” He died in London in 1911, while still\r\nin the service of the _Sun_; still believing in the impossibility of\r\nputting off forever the great war which so often rose in his visions.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Chamberlin’s service on the _Sun_ was briefer than that of\r\nthe Chamberlin brothers or H. R. Chamberlain. He came to New York from\r\nChicago, where he had been a reporter on the _Herald_, the _Tribune_,\r\nthe _Inter-Ocean_, the _Times_, and the _Record_. After 1894, when he\r\nleft the _Sun_, he was again with the Chicago _Record_, and in that\r\npaper’s service he saw the Santiago sea-fight from his boat--the only\r\nnewspaper boat with the American squadron.\r\n\r\nNor must any of these Chamberlins and Chamberlains be confused with\r\nsome of their distinguished contemporaries not of the _Sun_--Joseph\r\nEdgar Chamberlin, who was the Cuban correspondent of the New York\r\n_Evening Post_ in 1898, and later an editorial writer on the New York\r\n_Evening Mail_ and the Boston _Transcript_; Eugene Tyler Chamberlain,\r\none-time editor of the Albany _Argus_; and Samuel Selwyn Chamberlain,\r\nson of the famous Ivory Chamberlain of the New York _Herald_, founder\r\nof the _Matin_ of Paris, and at various times editor of the San\r\nFrancisco _Examiner_ and the New York _American_.\r\n\r\nEdward G. Riggs, who left the _Sun_ on February 1, 1913, to become\r\na railroad executive, had been a _Sun_ reporter and political\r\ncorrespondent for twenty-eight years. He joined the staff in 1885 as\r\na Wall Street reporter. Though he never lost interest in the world of\r\nfinance and its remarkable men, he soon gravitated toward politics. He\r\nbecame, indeed, the best-known writer of political news in America. He\r\nwrote at every national convention from 1888--when Ambrose W. Lyman,\r\nthen the Washington correspondent of the _Sun_, was at the head of a\r\nstaff that included Julian Ralph and E. O. Chamberlin--until 1912. In\r\n1892 Ralph was in charge of the _Sun’s_ national convention work, with\r\nRiggs as his first lieutenant; but Riggs was the _Sun’s_ top-sawyer at\r\nthe conventions of 1896, 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1912.\r\n\r\nRiggs had a closer view of the wheels of the political machines of New\r\nYork State than any other political writer. His intimate acquaintance\r\nwith Senators Platt and Hill, Governors Odell and Flower, and the\r\nother powers of the State brought to him one hundred per cent of the\r\npolitical truths of his time--the ten per cent that can be printed and\r\nthe ninety per cent that can’t.\r\n\r\nRiggs never became a regular correspondent at either Washington or\r\nAlbany. He preferred to rove, going where the news was. In Washington\r\nhe knew and was welcomed by Presidents Harrison, Cleveland, McKinley,\r\nRoosevelt, and Taft; by Senators like Hanna and Quay; by Cabinet\r\nmembers like Hay and Knox; by House leaders like Reed and Bland. He\r\nknew J. P. Morgan and William C. Whitney as well as he knew William J.\r\nBryan and Peffer, the Kansas Populist.\r\n\r\nBetween Presidential elections, when political affairs were quiet in\r\nNew York, Riggs acted as a scout for the _Sun_ with the whole country\r\nto scan. Mr. Dana had an unflagging interest in politics, and he relied\r\non Riggs to bring reports from every field from Maine to California.\r\n\r\n“Riggs,” Dana once remarked to a friend, “is my Phil Sheridan.”\r\n\r\nIt was through Riggs that Thomas C. Platt, then the Republican\r\nmaster of New York State, sent word to Dana that he would like to\r\nhave the _Sun’s_ idea of a financial plank for the Republican State\r\nplatform of 1896. The plank was written by Mr. Dana and the _Sun’s_\r\npublisher--afterward owner--William M. Laffan. It denounced the\r\nmovement for the free coinage of silver and declared in favour of the\r\ngold standard. The State convention, held in March, adopted Dana’s\r\nplank, and the national convention in June accepted the same ideas\r\nin framing the platform upon which Major McKinley was elected to the\r\nPresidency.\r\n\r\nIt was Riggs who carried a message from Dana to Platt, in 1897, asking\r\nthe New York Senator to withdraw his opposition to the nomination of\r\nTheodore Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Platt complied,\r\nand Roosevelt got the position.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in response to a question as to the difference between\r\na political reporter and a political correspondent, Riggs wrote:\r\n\r\n    There was a vast difference between the two. The political\r\n    reporter is he who begins at the foot of the ladder when he\r\n    reports the actual facts at a ward meeting. The political\r\n    correspondent is he who has run the gamut of ward meetings,\r\n    primaries, Assembly district, Senate district, and Congress\r\n    district conventions, city conventions, county conventions,\r\n    State conventions, and national conventions, and who builds his\r\n    articles to his newspaper on his information of the situation\r\n    in the State or nation, based upon circumstances and facts\r\n    arising out of all of the aforesaid conventions.\r\n\r\n    A political reporter and a political correspondent occupy in\r\n    newspaper life the same relative positions as the cellar-digger\r\n    and the architect in the building-trade world. Cellar-digger\r\n    is just as important in his sphere as architect. The most\r\n    superb architects were the most superb cellar-diggers. No man\r\n    can be a successful political correspondent unless he has\r\n    been a successful political reporter. Judges are made out of\r\n    lawyers, generals and admirals out of cadets. Only the most\r\n    ordinary of human virtues are necessary for the equipment of a\r\n    successful political reporter and correspondent--cleanliness,\r\n    sobriety, honesty, and truthfulness.\r\n\r\nWriting of Riggs as the dean of American political correspondents,\r\nSamuel G. Blythe said in the _Saturday Evening Post_:\r\n\r\n    He has made it his business to know men in all parts of the\r\n    country, and to know them so they will tell him as much of\r\n    the truth as they will tell anybody. He is tenacious of his\r\n    opinions and loyal to his friends. He is jolly, good-natured,\r\n    companionable, and a fine chap to have around when he is in\r\n    repose. Wherever men spoke the English language he was known as\r\n    “Riggs--of the _Sun_.”\r\n\r\n    Reputation and success in newspaper work demand the highest\r\n    and most unselfish loyalty to one’s paper. It must be the\r\n    paper first and nothing else second. Loyalty is Riggs’s first\r\n    attribute, even better than his courage.\r\n\r\n    The influence of a man like Riggs cannot be estimated. There is\r\n    no way of computing this, but there is no person who will deny\r\n    that he has been a power. He has not had his head turned by\r\n    flattery. He has been “Riggs--of the _Sun_.”\r\n\r\nOne of Mr. Riggs’s last great pieces of newspaper work was a\r\ntwenty-thousand-word history of national conventions which appeared\r\nin the _Sun_ in 1912--the first history of its kind ever written. Mr.\r\nRiggs was also a frequent contributor to the editorial page.\r\n\r\nArthur Brisbane, when he became a _Sun_ reporter in 1882, was\r\nalmost the youngest reporter the _Sun_ had had; he went to work on\r\nhis eighteenth birthday. He had been intensively educated in America\r\nand abroad. In his first three or four months he was a puzzle to his\r\nsuperiors, his colleagues, and perhaps to himself.\r\n\r\n“He sat around,” said one of his contemporary reporters, “like a fellow\r\nwho didn’t understand what it was all about--and then he came out of\r\nhis trance like a shot from a gun and seemed to know everything about\r\neverything.”\r\n\r\nBrisbane was well liked. He was a handsome, athletic youth, interested\r\nin all lines of life and literature, cheerful, and eager for\r\nadventurous assignment. After two years of reportorial work he went to\r\nFrance to continue certain studies, and while he was there the _Sun_\r\noffered to him the post of London correspondent, which he accepted.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1888, when John L. Sullivan and Charley Mitchell went to\r\nChantilly, in France, for their celebrated fight, Brisbane went with\r\nthem and wrote a good two-column story about it--a story that contained\r\nnever a word of pugilistic slang but a great deal of interest. He saw\r\nthe human side:\r\n\r\n    Deeply interested were the handfuls of Frenchmen who gathered\r\n    and watched from such a safe and distant pavilion as we would\r\n    select to look upon a hyena fight.\r\n\r\nAnd, when other reporters were deafened by the battle, Brisbane heard\r\nthe plaintive appeal of Baldock, Mitchell’s tough second:\r\n\r\n    “Think of the kids, Charley, the dear little kids, a calling\r\n    for you at home and a counting on you for bread! Think what\r\n    their feelings will be if you don’t knock the ear off him, and\r\n    knock it off him again!”\r\n\r\nNot but what the correspondent paid conscientious attention to the\r\ntechnique of the fray:\r\n\r\n    A detailed report of each of the thirty-nine rounds taken by\r\n    me shows that out of more than a hundred wild rushes made by\r\n    Sullivan, and of which any one would have been followed by\r\n    a knockout in Madison Square, not half a dozen resulted in\r\n    anything.\r\n\r\nA couple of years after the establishment of the _Evening Sun_ Brisbane\r\nwas made its managing editor--a big job for a man of twenty-three\r\nyears. In 1890 he went to the _World_, where he became the editor of\r\nthe Sunday magazine and the most illustrious exponent of that startling\r\nform of graphic art which demonstrates to the reader, without calling\r\nupon his brain for undue effort, how much taller than the Washington\r\nMonument would be New York’s daily consumption of dill pickles, if\r\npiled monumentwise.\r\n\r\nSeven years later Mr. Hearst took Brisbane from Mr. Pulitzer and made\r\nhim editor of the _Evening Journal_--a position eminently suited to\r\nhis talents, for here he was able to write as he wished in that clear,\r\nsimple style which had endeared him to the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nBrisbane’s newspaper style goes directly back to the writing of William\r\nO. Bartlett. It has its terse, cutting qualities, the avoidance of\r\nall but the simplest words, and the direct drive at the object to be\r\nattained. Brisbane, too, adopted the Dana principle that nothing was\r\nmore valuable in editorial writing, for the achievement of a purpose,\r\nthan iteration and reiteration. This was the plan that Dana always\r\nfollowed in his political battles--incessant drum-fire. Brisbane uses\r\nit now as proprietor of the Washington _Times_, which he bought from\r\nFrank A. Munsey, the present owner of the _Sun_, in June, 1917.\r\n\r\nJohn R. Spears was one of the big _Sun_ men for fifteen years. He, like\r\nAmos Cummings and Julian Ralph, was brought up in the atmosphere of a\r\nprinting-office as a small boy; but in 1866, when he was sixteen years\r\nold, he entered the Naval Academy at Annapolis and spent a couple of\r\nyears as a naval cadet. His cruise around the world in a training-ship\r\nfilled him with a love of the sea that never left him. His marine\r\nknowledge helped him and the _Sun_, for which he wrote fine stories of\r\nthe international yacht-races between the Mayflower and the Galatea\r\n(1886) and the Volunteer and the Thistle (1887).\r\n\r\nSpears liked wild life on land, too, and the _Sun_ sent him into the\r\nmountains of West Virginia and Kentucky to tell of the feuds of the\r\nHatfields and the McCoys. He went into the Ozarks to write up the Bald\r\nKnobbers, and he sent picturesque stories, in the eighties, from No\r\nMan’s Land, that unappropriated strip between Kansas and Texas which\r\nknew no law from 1850, when it was taken from Mexico, until 1890, when\r\nit became a part of the new State of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nSpears was a hard worker. They said of him in the _Sun_ office that he\r\nnever went out on an assignment without bringing in the material for a\r\nspecial article for the Sunday paper. He wrote several books, including\r\n“The Gold Diggings of Cape Horn,” “The Port of Missing Ships,” “The\r\nHistory of Our Navy,” “The Story of the American Merchant Marine,” “The\r\nStory of the New England Whalers,” and “The History of the American\r\nSlave Trade.” He now lives in retirement near Little Falls, New York.\r\nHis son, Raymond S. Spears, the fiction-writer, was a _Sun_ reporter\r\nfrom 1896 to 1900.\r\n\r\nPark Row knows Erasmus D. Beach chiefly through the book-reviews he\r\nwrote for the _Sun_ during many years, but he was a first-class\r\nreporter, too. The _Sun_ liked specialists, but no man could expect to\r\nstick to his specialty. When Gustav Kobbé went on the _Sun_ in March,\r\n1880, it was for the general purpose of assisting William M. Laffan in\r\ndramatic criticism and Francis C. Bowman in musical criticism; but his\r\nfirst assignment was to go to Bellevue Hospital and investigate the\r\nreported mistreatment of smallpox patients--a job which he accepted\r\nlike the good soldier that every good _Sun_ man is.\r\n\r\nMr. Beach was a clever all-round writer and reporter, with a leaning\r\ntoward the purely literary side of the business, and he had no special\r\nfondness for sports; but the _Sun_ sent him, with Christopher J.\r\nFitzgerald and David Graham Phillips, to report the Yale-Princeton\r\nfootball-game at Eastern Park, Brooklyn, on Thanksgiving Day,\r\n1890--that glorious day for Yale when the score in her favour was\r\nthirty-two to nothing. It was the time of Heffelfinger and Poe, McClung\r\nand King. Beach wrote an introduction which Mr. Dana classed as\r\nHomeric. Here is a bit of it:\r\n\r\n    Great in the annals of Yale forever must be the name of\r\n    McClung. Twice within a few minutes this man has carried the\r\n    ball over the Princeton goal-line. He runs like a deer, has the\r\n    stability of footing of one of the pyramids, and is absolutely\r\n    cool in the most frightfully exciting circumstances.\r\n\r\n    A curious figure is McClung. He has just finished a run of\r\n    twenty yards, with all Princeton shoving against him. He\r\n    is steaming like a pot of porridge, and chewing gum. His\r\n    vigorously working profile is clearly outlined against the\r\n    descending sun. How dirty he is! His paddings seem to have\r\n    become loosed and to have accumulated over his knees. He has\r\n    a shield, a sort of splint, bound upon his right shin. His\r\n    long hair is held in a band, a linen fillet, the dirtiest ever\r\n    worn.\r\n\r\n    He pants as a man who has run fifty miles--who has overthrown a\r\n    house. He droops slightly for a moment’s rest, hands on knees,\r\n    eyes shining with the glare of battle, the gum catching between\r\n    his grinders. A tab on one of his ears signifies a severe\r\n    injury to that organ, an injury received in some previous match\r\n    from an opposition boot-heel, or from a slide over the rough\r\n    earth with half a dozen of the enemy seated upon him. He has a\r\n    little, sharp-featured face, squirrel-like, with a Roman nose\r\n    and eyes set near together. Brief dental gleams illuminate his\r\n    countenance in his moments of great joyfulness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    EDWARD G. RIGGS\r\n]\r\n\r\nDana liked Beach’s introduction because the reader need not be a\r\nfootball fan to enjoy it. For the technique of the game he who wished\r\nto follow the plays could find all that he wanted in the stories of\r\nFitzgerald and Phillips.\r\n\r\nIn connection with Beach’s literary accomplishments, there is a\r\ntradition that another famous _Sun_ reporter of the eighties, Charles\r\nM. Fairbanks, was assigned to report one of the great games at\r\nPrinceton, and, although entirely unacquainted with punts and tackles,\r\ncame back with a story complete in technical detail, having learned the\r\nfine points of football in a few hours. Later, in the early nineties,\r\nFairbanks was night editor of the paper.\r\n\r\nA _Sun_ man who has been a _Sun_ man from a time to which the memory\r\nof man goeth back only with a long pull, is Samuel A. Wood, who has\r\nbeen the _Sun’s_ ship-news man for more than thirty-five years. He is\r\na good example, too, of the _Sun_ man’s anonymity, for although he was\r\nthe originator of the rhymed news story and his little run-in lyrics\r\nhave been the admiration of American newspapermen for more than a\r\ngeneration, few persons beyond Park Row have known Wood as the author\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nAlthough a first-class general reporter, Wood has stuck closely to\r\nhis favourite topics, the ships and the weather. He made weather news\r\nbearable with such bits as this:\r\n\r\n    The sun has crossed the line, and now the weather may be\r\n    vernal; that is, if no more cyclones come, like yesterday’s, to\r\n    spurn all the efforts of the spring to come as per the classic\r\n    rhymers. (Perhaps there was a spring in those days of the\r\n    good old-timers!) But this spring sprang a fearful leak from\r\n    clouded dome supernal, and weather that should be divine might\r\n    be declared infernal; entirely too much chilliness, nocturnal\r\n    and diurnal, which prompted many citizens to take, for woes\r\n    external, the ancient spring reviver of the old Kentucky\r\n    colonel.\r\n\r\n    The mercury fell down the tube a point below the freezing, and\r\n    Spring herself might be excused for shivering and sneezing. The\r\n    wind, a brisk northeaster, howled, the sky was dark and solemn,\r\n    and chills chased one another up and down the spinal column.\r\n\r\n    Oh hail, diphtherial mildness, hail, and rain, and snow--and\r\n    blossom! Perhaps the spring has really come, and may be playing\r\n    possum!\r\n\r\nWood writes rhymeless sea-stories with the grace of a Clark Russell. He\r\nturns to prose-verse only when the subject particularly suits it, as\r\nfor instance in the story upon which Mr. Clarke, the night city editor,\r\nwrote the classic head--“Snygless the Seas Are--Wiig Rides the Waves No\r\nMore--Back Come Banana Men--Skaal to the Vikings!” This is the text:\r\n\r\n    While off the Honduranean coast, not far from Ruatan, the\r\n    famous little fruiter Snyg on dirty weather ran. Her skipper,\r\n    Wiig, was at the helm, the boatswain hove the lead; the air was\r\n    thick; you could not see a half-ship’s length ahead. The mate\r\n    said:\r\n\r\n    “Reefs of Ruatan, I think, are off our bow.”\r\n\r\n    The skipper answered:\r\n\r\n    “You are right; they’re inside of us now.”\r\n\r\n    The water filled the engine-room and put the fires out, and\r\n    quickly o’er the weather rail the seas began to spout.\r\n\r\n    When dawn appeared there also came three blacks from off the\r\n    isle. They deftly managed their canoe, each wearing but a\r\n    smile; but, clever as they were, their boat was smashed against\r\n    the Snyg, and they were promptly hauled aboard by gallant\r\n    Captain Wiig.\r\n\r\n    “We had thirteen aboard this ship,” the fearful cook remarked.\r\n    “I think we stand a chance for life, since three coons have\r\n    embarked. Now let our good retriever, Nig, a life-line take\r\n    ashore, and all hands of the steamship Snyg may see New York\r\n    once more.”\r\n\r\n    But Nig refused to leave the ship, and so the fearless crew the\r\n    life-boat launched, but breakers stove the stout craft through\r\n    and through. Said Captain Wiig:\r\n\r\n    “Though foiled by Nig, our jig’s not up, I vow; I’ve still my\r\n    gig, and I don’t care a fig--I’ll make the beach somehow!”\r\n\r\n    And Mate Charles Christian of the Snyg (who got here yesterday)\r\n    helped launch the stanch gig of the Snyg so the crew could\r\n    get away. The gig was anchored far inshore; with raft and\r\n    trolley-line all hands on the Snyg, including Nig, were hauled\r\n    safe o’er the brine.\r\n\r\n    Although the Snyg, of schooner rig, will ply the waves no more,\r\n    let us hope that Wiig gets another Snyg for the sake of the\r\n    bards ashore.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ handling of the news of the brief war with Spain, in 1898,\r\nhas an interest beyond the mere brilliance of its men’s work and the\r\nfact that this was the last war in which the newspaper correspondents\r\nhad practically a free hand.\r\n\r\nFor years “Cuba Libre” had been one of the _Sun’s_ fights. From the\r\nfirst days of his control of the paper Mr. Dana had urged the overthrow\r\nof Spanish dominion in the island. His support of the revolutionists\r\nwent back, as E. P. Mitchell has written, “to the dark remoteness of\r\nthe struggles a quarter of a century before the war--the time of the\r\nCespedes uprising, the Virginius affair, and the variegated activities\r\nof the New York Junta.” Mr. Mitchell adds:\r\n\r\n    The affection of the _Sun_ and its editor for everything Cuban\r\n    except Spanish domination lasted quite down to and after the\r\n    second advent of Maximo Gomez; it was never livelier than in\r\n    the middle seventies.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Dana was the warm friend of José Marti. He corresponded\r\n    personally (with the assistance of his Fenian stenographer,\r\n    Williams) with the leading revolutionists actually fighting\r\n    in the island. He was the constant and unwearied intellectual\r\n    resource of a swarm of patriots, adventurers, near-filibusters,\r\n    bondholding financiers, lawyer-diplomats, and grafters\r\n    operating exclusively in Manhattan. A Latin-American accent was\r\n    a sure card of admission to the woven-bottomed chair alongside\r\n    the little round table in the inner corner room of the series\r\n    of four inhabited by the _Sun’s_ entire force of editors and\r\n    reporters.\r\n\r\n    We were then the foremost if not the only American organ of\r\n    Cuban independence. The executive journalistic headquarters\r\n    of the cause was just outside Mr. Dana’s front door. The Cuba\r\n    Libre editor, as I suppose he would be styled nowadays, was a\r\n    gentleman of Latin-American origin, who bore the aggressive and\r\n    appropriate name of Rebello. The Cuba Libre “desk” was about as\r\n    depressing a seat of literary endeavor as the telegraph-blank\r\n    shelf in a country railroad station, which it resembled in its\r\n    narrowness, its dismal ink-wells, rusty pens, and other details\r\n    of disreputable equipment. From this shelf there issued, by\r\n    Mr. Dana’s direction, many encouraging editorial remarks to\r\n    Rebello’s compatriots in the jungle.\r\n\r\nNor was free Cuba ungrateful to the _Sun_. A few years after the\r\nwar, when Mr. Mitchell was walking about the interior Cuban town of\r\nCamaguey, formerly Puerto Principe, he came upon a modest little\r\npublic square, the lamp-posts of which were labelled “Plaza Charles A.\r\nDana.” At the corner of the church of Las Mercedes was a tablet with\r\nthe following inscription:\r\n\r\n  TRIBUTO DEL PUEBLO A LA MEMORIA DE\r\n  CHARLES A. DANA\r\n  ILLUSTRE PUBLICISTA AMERICANO\r\n  DEFENSOR INFATIGABLE DE LAS\r\n  LIBERTADES CUBANAS\r\n  ABRIL 10 DE 1899\r\n\r\nDana was dead, without having seen the blooming of the flower he had\r\nwatered, but Cuba had not wholly forgotten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the Maine was blown up in February, 1898, the _Sun_ began\r\npreparations to cover a war. The managing editor, Chester S. Lord,\r\nassisted by W. J. Chamberlin, worked out the preliminary arrangements.\r\nJohn R. Spears, then thirty-eight years old and a reporter of wide\r\nexperience, particularly in matters of the sea--he had already written\r\n“The History of Our Navy”--was sent to Key West, the headquarters of\r\nthe fleet which was to blockade Havana. He was at Key West some weeks\r\nbefore war was declared.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ chartered the steam yacht Kanapaha and sent her at once to\r\nKey West, under the command of Captain Packard, to take on Spears and\r\nhis staff, which included Harold M. Anderson, Nelson Lloyd, Walstein\r\nRoot, Dana H. Carroll, and others. Besides the men named, who were to\r\ngo with the Kanapaha on her voyage with Sampson’s fleet, the _Sun_ sent\r\nOscar King Davis with Schley’s squadron, and Thomas M. Dieuaide on\r\nboard the Texas. Dieuaide got a splendid view of the great sea-fight of\r\nJuly 3, when Cervera came out of the harbour of Santiago, and he wrote\r\nthe _Sun’s_ first detailed account of the destruction of the Spanish\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ men ashore in Cuba were captained by W. J. Chamberlin, who\r\nsucceeded Mr. Spears some time before the battle of Santiago. His force\r\nincluded H. M. Anderson, Carroll and Root of the _Sun_, and Henry M.\r\nArmstrong and Acton Davies of the _Evening Sun_. Armstrong, who was\r\nwith Shafter, covered much of the attack and investment of Santiago\r\nand the surrender of that city. It was Chamberlin who sent to the\r\nUnited States the first news of the formal surrender of Santiago, but\r\nthe message was not delivered to the _Sun_. The government censorship\r\ngently commandeered it and gave it out as an official bulletin.\r\nChamberlin wrote the story of the battle of San Juan Hill on board a\r\ntossing boat that carried him from Siboney to the cable station at Port\r\nAntonio.\r\n\r\nThe first American flag hoisted over the Morro at Santiago was the\r\nproperty of the _Sun_, but in this case there was no government\r\npeculation. Anderson and Acton Davies gave the flag, which was a boat\r\nensign from the Kanapaha, to some sailors of the Texas, and the sailors\r\nfastened it to the Morro staff.\r\n\r\nWhen Schley’s squadron was united with Sampson’s fleet, some time\r\nbefore the battle of Santiago, O. K. Davis was ordered to Manila.\r\nHe had the luck to sail on the cruiser Charleston, which, on June\r\n21, 1898, made the conquest of the island of Guam. That famous but\r\nbloodless victory was described by Davis in a two-page article which\r\nwas exclusively the _Sun’s_, and of which the _Sun_ said editorially on\r\nAugust 9, 1898:\r\n\r\n    No such story ever has been written or ever will be written\r\n    of our conquest of the Ladrones as that of the Sun’s\r\n    correspondent, published yesterday morning. It is the picture\r\n    of a historic scene, in which not a single detail is wanting.\r\n    This far-away little isle of Guam, so much out of the world\r\n    that it had not heard of our war with Spain, and mistook the\r\n    Charleston’s shells for an honorary salute, is now a part of\r\n    the United States of America, and destined to share in the\r\n    greatness of a progressive country. The queer Spanish governor,\r\n    who declined to go upon Captain Glass’s ship because it would\r\n    be a breach of Spanish regulations, is now our prisoner at\r\n    Manila.\r\n\r\nDieuaide, who wrote the _Sun’s_ story of the Santiago sea-fight, is\r\nalso distinguished as the author of the first published description\r\nof St. Pierre--or, rather, of the ashes that covered it--after that\r\ncity and all but two persons of its thirty thousand had been buried by\r\nthe eruption of Mont Pelée. The introductory paragraph of Dieuaide’s\r\narticle gives an idea of his graphic power:\r\n\r\n    FORT DE FRANCE, MARTINIQUE, May 21--To-day we saw St. Pierre,\r\n    the ghastliest ghost of the modern centuries. But yesterday\r\n    the fairest of the fair of the wondrous cities of the storied\r\n    Antilles, bright, beautiful, glorious, glistening and\r\n    shimmering in her prism of tropical radiance, an opalescent\r\n    city in a setting of towering forest and mountain, now a\r\n    waste of ashen-gray without life, form, color, shape, a drear\r\n    monotone, a dim blur on the landscape--it seems even more than\r\n    the contrast between life and death.\r\n\r\n    The dead may live. St. Pierre is not alive, and never will\r\n    be. Out of shape has come a void. It is the apotheosis of\r\n    annihilation. To one who sits amid the ruins and gazes the\r\n    long miles upward over the seamed sides of La Pelée, still\r\n    thundering her terrible wrath, may come some conception of the\r\n    future ruin of the worlds.\r\n\r\n    It has been a day of sharp impressions, one cutting into\r\n    another until the memory-pad of the mind is crossed and\r\n    crisscrossed like the fissured flanks of La Pelée herself;\r\n    but most deeply graven of all, paradoxically, is the memory\r\n    of a dimness, a nothingness, an emptiness, a lack of\r\n    everything--the gray barrenness unrelieved of what was the\r\n    rainbow St. Pierre. Mont Pelée, the most awful evidence of\r\n    natural force to be seen in the world to-day--La Pelée,\r\n    majestic, terrible, overpowering, has been in evidence from\r\n    starlight to starlight, but it is the ashen blank that was once\r\n    the city of the Saint of the Rock that stands out most clearly\r\n    in the kaleidoscopic maze slipping backward and forward before\r\n    our eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd thus on, without losing interest, for seven solid columns.\r\n\r\nWill Irwin’s great page story, printed beside the straight news of\r\nthe San Francisco earthquake, is another _Sun_ classic. Irwin had\r\nthe fortune to be familiar with San Francisco, and he was able,\r\nwithout reference to book or map, to give to New York, through the\r\n_Sun_, a most vivid picture of “The City That Was.” It is a literary\r\ncompanion-piece of Thomas M. Dieuaide’s gray drawing of St. Pierre, but\r\nonly the introduction must do here:\r\n\r\n    The old San Francisco is dead. The gayest, lightest-hearted,\r\n    most pleasure-loving city of this continent, and in many ways\r\n    the most interesting and romantic, is a horde of huddled\r\n    refugees living among ruins. It may rebuild; it probably will;\r\n    but those who have known that peculiar city by the Golden Gate,\r\n    and have caught its flavor of the “Arabian Nights” feel that it\r\n    can never be the same.\r\n\r\n    It is as though a pretty, frivolous woman had passed through a\r\n    great tragedy. She survives, but she is sobered and different.\r\n    If it rises out of the ashes it must be a modern city, much\r\n    like other cities and without its old flavor.\r\n\r\nThere were less than five columns of the article, but it told the\r\nwhole story of San Francisco; not in dry figures of commerce and paved\r\nstreets, but of the people and places that every Eastern man had\r\nlonged to see, but now never could see.\r\n\r\nWriters like Ralph and Chamberlin, Dieuaide and Irwin, are spoken of as\r\n“star” reporters, yet the saying that the _Sun_ has no star men is not\r\nentirely fictional. Its best reporters are, and will be, remembered as\r\nstars, but no men were, or are, treated as stars. Big reporters cover\r\nlittle stories and cubs write big ones--if they can. A city editor does\r\nnot send an inexperienced man on an assignment that requires all the\r\nskill of the trained reporter, yet it is _Sun_ history that many new\r\nmen have turned in big stories from assignments that appeared, at first\r\nblush, to be inconsequential. There are always two or three so-called\r\nstar men in the office, but the days when there are two or three star\r\nassignments are comparatively few.\r\n\r\nLet us take, arbitrarily, one day twenty-five years ago--February 1,\r\n1893--and see what some of the _Sun_ reporters did:\r\n\r\n  Jefferson Market Court                    S. H. Adams\r\n  Essex Market Court and Meeting of Irish\r\n      Federalists                           Rudolph E. Block\r\n  With R. Croker at Lakewood                George B.

Coleman\r\n  Fire at Koster & Bial’s                   John Kenny\r\n  Bishop McDonnell’s Trip to Rome           Evans\r\n\r\nTo gain an impression of the variety of work which comes to a _Sun_\r\nreporter, take the assignments given to David Graham Phillips in the\r\nlast days of his service with the _Sun_ in 1893:\r\n\r\n  March  1--Joseph Jefferson’s Lecture on the Drama\r\n    ”    2--Bear Hunt at Glen Cove\r\n    ”    3--Special Stories for the Sunday _Sun_\r\n    ”    6--Obituary of W. P. Demarest\r\n    ”    7--Meeting of Russian-Americans\r\n    ”    8--Mystery at New Brunswick, New Jersey\r\n    ”    9--Special Stories for Sunday\r\n    ”   10--Accident in Seventy-First St. Tunnel\r\n    ”   11--More Triplets in Cold Spring\r\n    ”   12--Services in Old Scotch Church\r\n    ”   13--Furniture Sale\r\n    ”   14--Opening of Hotel Waldorf\r\n    ”   15--Married Four Days, Then False\r\n    ”   17--Dinner, Friendly Sons of St. Patrick\r\n    ”   18--Parade and Show, Barnum & Bailey\r\n    ”   19--Church Quarrel, Rutherford, N. J.\r\n\r\nPhillips was then one of the _Sun’s_ best reporters; not as large\r\na figure in the office as Ralph, or Chamberlin, or Spears, but one\r\nentitled to assignments of the first class. A list of his assignments\r\nsoon after he joined the staff in the summer of 1890 would be\r\nmonotonous--Jefferson Market police-court day after day; the kind of\r\nwork with which the _Sun_ broke in a new man. Once on space, with eight\r\ndollars a column instead of fifteen dollars a week, Phillips got what\r\nhe wanted--a peep at every corner of city life. In a little more than\r\ntwo years as a space man he picked up much of the material that is seen\r\nin his novels.\r\n\r\nA _Sun_ man takes what comes to his lot. When W. J. Chamberlin returned\r\nfrom Cuba, his first assignment was a small police case. But a really\r\ngood reporter finds his opportunity and his “big” stories for himself.\r\n\r\nIt would take a small book to give a list of the “big” stories that the\r\n_Sun_ has printed, and a five-foot shelf of tall volumes to reprint\r\nthem all. Some of them were written leisurely, like Spears’s stories\r\nof the Bad Lands, some in comparative ease, like Ralph’s stories of\r\nPresidential inaugurations and the Grant funeral, or W. J. Chamberlin’s\r\neleven-column report of the Dewey parade in 1899. In these latter the\r\nease is only comparative, for the writer’s fingers had no time to rest\r\nin the achievement of such gigantic tasks. And the comparison is with\r\nthe work done by reporters on occasions when there was no time to\r\narrange ideas and choose words; when the facts came in what would be to\r\nthe layman hopeless disorder.\r\n\r\nSuch an occasion, for instance, was the burning of the excursion\r\nsteamer General Slocum, the description of which--in the end a\r\nmarvellous tale of horror--was taken page by page from Lindsay Denison\r\nas his typewriter milled it out. Such an occasion was Edwin C. Hill’s\r\nopportunity to write his notable leads to the stories of the Republic\r\nwreck in 1909 and the Titanic disaster in 1912. But the _Sun_ and _Sun_\r\nmen never have hysterics. Tragedy seems to tighten them up more than\r\nother newspapers and newspapermen.\r\n\r\nIntroductions to big stories tell the pulse of the paper. Read, for\r\nexample, the _Sun_ introduction to the great ocean tragedy of 1898:\r\n\r\n    HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA, July 6--The steamship La Bourgogne of\r\n    the Compagnie Générale Transatlantique, which left New York\r\n    on Saturday last bound for Havre, was sunk at five o’clock\r\n    on Monday morning after a collision with the British ship\r\n    Cromartyshire in a dense fog about sixty miles south of Sable\r\n    Island. The ship had 750 persons aboard. The number of first\r\n    and second cabin passengers was 220 and of the steerage\r\n    passengers 297, a total of 517. The number of officers was 11,\r\n    of the crew 222. Eleven second-cabin and 51 steerage passengers\r\n    and 104 of the crew, a total of 166, were saved. All the\r\n    officers but four, all the first-cabin passengers, and all but\r\n    one of the more than one hundred women on board, were lost. The\r\n    number of lost is believed to be 584.\r\n\r\nThis was more detailed, but not more calm than the opening of Edwin C.\r\nHill’s story on the loss of the Titanic:\r\n\r\n    The greatest marine disaster in the history of ocean traffic\r\n    occurred last Sunday night, when the Titanic of the White\r\n    Star Line, the greatest steamship that ever sailed the sea,\r\n    shattered herself against an iceberg and sank with, it is\r\n    feared, fifteen hundred of her passengers and crew in less\r\n    than four hours. The monstrous modern ships may defy wind and\r\n    weather, but ice and fog remain unconquered.\r\n\r\n    Out of nearly twenty-four hundred people that the Titanic\r\n    carried, only eight hundred and sixty-six are known to have\r\n    been saved, and most of these were women and children.\r\n\r\nProbably the most restrained lead on a _Sun_ account of a great\r\ndisaster was the introduction to the article on the Brooklyn Theatre\r\nfire of 1876:\r\n\r\n    The Brooklyn Theatre was built in September, 1871, opened for\r\n    public entertainment October 2, 1871, and burned to the ground\r\n    with the sacrifice of three hundred lives on the night of\r\n    Tuesday, December 5, 1876.\r\n\r\nOf a more literary character, yet void of excitement, was the way\r\nJulian Ralph began his narrative of the blizzard of March, 1888:\r\n\r\n    It was as if New York had been a burning candle upon which\r\n    nature had clapped a snuffer, leaving nothing of the city’s\r\n    activities but a struggling ember.\r\n\r\nWhile on this subject, it is as well to say that the _Sun_, in ordinary\r\nstories, does without introductions. “Begin at the beginning” has been\r\none of its unwritten rules; or, as a veteran copy-reader remarked to a\r\nnew reporter who told it all in the first paragraph:\r\n\r\n“For the love of Mike, can’t you leave something for the head-writer to\r\nsay?”\r\n\r\nEvery young newspaper man hears a good deal about “human-interest\r\nstories.” Some of the professors of journalism tell their pupils what\r\nhuman-interest stories are; others advise the best way to know one, or\r\nto get one. It is not evident, however, that any one has devised an\r\ninfallible formula for taking a trivial or commonplace event and, by\r\nreason of the humour, pathos, or liveliness thereof, lifting it to a\r\nhigher plane.\r\n\r\nAmos Cummings is believed to have been the first newspaperman to see\r\nthe news value of the lost child or the steer loose in the street.\r\nAmos himself wrote a story about the steer. Ralph wrote another one,\r\nand got his first job in New York on the strength of it. Frank W.\r\nO’Malley wrote one recently, and made New York laugh over it. But\r\nyour newspaperman needs something besides a frightened steer and some\r\nstreets; he must have “something in his noddle,” as Mr. Dana used to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\nEvery reporter gets a chance to write a story about a lost child, but\r\nthere are perhaps only two lost-child stories of the last thirty years\r\nthat are remembered, and both were _Sun_ stories. David Graham Phillips\r\nfound his lost child in the Catskills and wrote an article over which\r\nwomen wept. The next time a child was lost, Phillips’s city editor sent\r\nhim on the assignment, and he fell down. The child was there, and the\r\nwoods, and the bloodhounds, but the reporter’s brain would not turn\r\nbackward and go again through the processes that made a great story.\r\nHill’s story, which is remembered by its head--“A Little Child in the\r\nDark”--will never be repeated--by Hill.\r\n\r\nThe tear-impelling article is the most difficult thing for a good\r\nreporter to write or a bad reporter to avoid trying to write. It might\r\nbe added that good reporters write a “sob story” only when it fastens\r\nitself on them and demands to be written; and then they write the facts\r\nand let the reader do the weeping. O’Malley’s story of the killing of\r\nPoliceman Gene Sheehan, which has been reprinted from the _Sun_ by\r\nseveral text-books for students of journalism, is good proof of this.\r\nPractically all of it--and it was a column long--was a straightforward\r\nreport of the story told by the policeman’s mother. This is a part:\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Catherine Sheehan stood in the darkened parlor of her\r\n    home at 361 West Fifteenth Street late yesterday afternoon and\r\n    told her version of the murder of her son Gene, the youthful\r\n    policeman whom a thug named Billy Morley shot in the forehead\r\n    down under the Chatham Square elevated station early yesterday\r\n    morning. Gene’s mother was thankful that her boy hadn’t killed\r\n    Billy Morley before he died, “because,” she said, “I can say\r\n    honestly, even now, that I’d rather have Gene’s dead body\r\n    brought home to me, as it will be to-night, than to have him\r\n    come to me and say, ‘Mother, I had to kill a man this morning.’\r\n\r\n    “God comfort the poor wretch that killed the boy,” the mother\r\n    went on, “because he is more unhappy to-night than we are here.\r\n    Maybe he was weak-minded through drink. He couldn’t have known\r\n    Gene, or he wouldn’t have killed him. Did they tell you at the\r\n    Oak Street Station that the other policemen called Gene ‘Happy\r\n    Sheehan’? Anything they told you about him is true, because\r\n    no one would lie about him. He was always happy, and he was a\r\n    fine-looking young man. He always had to duck his helmet when\r\n    he walked under the gas-fixture in the hall as he went out the\r\n    door.\r\n\r\n    “After he went down the street yesterday I found a little book\r\n    on a chair--a little list of the streets or something that Gene\r\n    had forgot. I knew how particular they are about such things,\r\n    and I didn’t want the boy to get in trouble, so I threw on a\r\n    shawl and walked over through Chambers Street toward the river\r\n    to find him. He was standing on a corner some place down there\r\n    near the bridge, clapping time with his hands for a little\r\n    newsy that was dancing; but he stopped clapping--struck, Gene\r\n    did, when he saw me. He laughed when I handed him a little book\r\n    and told him that was why I’d searched for him, patting me on\r\n    the shoulder when he laughed--patting me on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n    “‘It’s a bad place for you here, Gene,’ I said. ‘Then it must\r\n    be bad for you, too, mammy,’ said he; and as he walked to the\r\n    end of his beat with me--it was dark then--he said, ‘There are\r\n    lots of crooks here, mother, and they know and hate me, and\r\n    they’re afraid of me’--proud, he said it--‘but maybe they’ll\r\n    get me some night.’\r\n\r\n    “He patted me on the back and turned and walked east toward his\r\n    death. Wasn’t it strange that Gene said that?\r\n\r\n    “You know how he was killed, of course, and how--now let me\r\n    talk about it, children, if I want to. I promised you, didn’t\r\n    I, that I wouldn’t cry any more or carry on? Well, it was five\r\n    o’clock this morning when a boy rang the bell here at the\r\n    house, and I looked out the window and said:\r\n\r\n    “‘Is Gene dead?’\r\n\r\n    “‘No, ma’am,’ answered the lad; ‘but they told me to tell you\r\n    he was hurt in a fire and is in the hospital.’\r\n\r\n    “Jerry, my other boy, had opened the door for the lad, and\r\n    was talking to him while I dressed a bit. And then I walked\r\n    down-stairs and saw Jerry standing silent under the gaslight;\r\n    and I said again, ‘Jerry, is Gene dead?’ And he said ‘Yes,’ and\r\n    he went out.\r\n\r\n    “After a while I went down to the Oak Street Station myself,\r\n    because I couldn’t wait for Jerry to come back. The policemen\r\n    all stopped talking when I came in, and then one of them told\r\n    me it was against the rules to show me Gene at that time; but I\r\n    knew the policeman only thought I’d break down. I promised him\r\n    I wouldn’t carry on, and he took me into a room to let me see\r\n    Gene. It was Gene.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ has been richly fortunate in the humour that has tinged its\r\nnews columns since its very beginning. Even Ben Day, with all the\r\nworries of a pioneer journalist, made the types exact a smile from his\r\nreaders. With Dana, amusing the people was second only to instructing\r\nthem. Julian Ralph and Wilbur Chamberlin both had the trick of putting\r\ntogether the bricks of fact with the mortar of humour. Chamberlin\r\nhad several characters, like his _Insec’ O’Connor_, whose strings he\r\npulled and made to dance. Hardly a sea-story of Sam Wood’s--except\r\nwhere there is tragedy--does not contain something to be laughed over.\r\nSamuel Hopkins Adams was an adept at the comic twist. Lindsay Denison\r\nonce wrote a story of a semipublic celebration of an engagement so\r\ndelightfully that the bride’s father, perhaps the only person in New\r\nYork who did not see the humour of the affair, threatened to break the\r\npledge of troth, although the groom was a public character who had\r\ncourted publicity all his life.\r\n\r\nCharles Selden, as grave a reporter as ever glowered at a poor\r\nspace-bill, had a vein of structural humour perhaps unsurpassed by\r\nany reporter. His account of a press reception at the home of Miss\r\nLillian Russell has been approached in delicacy only by O’Malley’s\r\ninterview with Miss Laura Jean Libbey. Selden’s story of the occasion\r\nwhen creditors took away all the furniture of John L. Sullivan’s\r\ncafé--except the one chair upon which the champion snoozed--was a model\r\nof dry, unlaboured humour.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the drollness with which O’Malley has delighted _Sun_\r\nreaders for ten years, take this extract from his report of the East\r\nSide Passover parade of 1917, referring to Counselor Levy, the Duke of\r\nEssex Street, whose title was conferred by the _Sun_ twenty years ago:\r\n\r\n    It was difficult for a time to get the details of the duke’s\r\n    Passover garb, owing to the fact that the interior of his\r\n    Nile-green limousine has recently been fitted up with\r\n    book-shelves, so that the duke can be surrounded with his law\r\n    library even when motoring to and from his office on the East\r\n    Side. Furthermore, every space not occupied by the duke and\r\n    duchess and the law library yesterday was decorated with floral\r\n    set pieces in honor of Easter, a large pillow of tuberoses\r\n    inscribed with the words “Our Duke” in purple immortelles,\r\n    and presented by the Essex Market Bar Association to their\r\n    dean, being the outstanding piece among the interior floral\r\n    decorations of the duke’s Rolls-Royce. Beside Ittchee, the\r\n    duke’s Jap valet and chauffeur, was a large rubber-plant, which\r\n    shut off the view, the rubber-plant being the Easter gift of\r\n    Solomon, Solomon, Solomon, Solomon, Solomon and Solomon, who\r\n    learned all their law as students in the offices of the duke.\r\n\r\n    Little or nothing remains to be told about the duke’s Easter\r\n    scenery. He was dressed in the mode, that’s all--high hat,\r\n    morning coat, trousers like Martin Littleton’s, mauve spats,\r\n    corn-colored gloves, patent-leather shoes, Russian-red cravat,\r\n    set off with a cameo showing the face of Lord Chief Justice\r\n    Russell in high relief. His only distinctive mark was the\r\n    absence of a gardenia on his lapel.\r\n\r\n    He was off then, waving his snakewood cane jauntily, while the\r\n    East Side scrambled after the car to try to feel the Nile-green\r\n    varnish. And with a final direction to Ittchee, “Go around by\r\n    Chauncey Depew’s house on the way home, my good man,” the car\r\n    exploded northward, and the Passover parade on Delancey Street\r\n    officially ended for the day.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a man who has lived five years as a _Sun_ reporter but\r\ncould write his own story of the _Sun_ just as he has written stories\r\nof life. Here but a few of these men and their work have been touched.\r\nIt has been a long parade from Wisner of 1833 to Hill of 1918. Many of\r\nthe great reporters are dead, and of some of these it may be said that\r\ntheir lives were shortened by the very fever in which they won their\r\nglory. Some passed on to other fields of endeavour. Others are waiting\r\nto write “the best story ever printed in the _Sun_.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the best story ever printed in the _Sun_? It may be that that\r\nstory has been quoted from in these articles; and yet, if a thousand\r\nyears hence some super-scientist should invent a literary measure that\r\nwould answer the question, the crown of that high and now unbestowable\r\nhonour of authorship might fall to some man here unmentioned and\r\nelsewhere unsung. Perhaps it was an article only two hundred words\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSOME GENIUS IN AN OLD ROOM\r\n\r\n  _Lord, Managing Editor for Thirty-Turn Years.--Clarke, Magician of\r\n    the Copy Desk.--Ethics, Fair Play and Democracy.--“The Evening\r\n    Sun” and Those Who Make It._\r\n\r\n\r\nFor forty-seven years the city or news room of the _Sun_ was on the\r\nthird floor of the brick building at the south corner of Nassau and\r\nFrankfort Streets, a five-story house built for Tammany Hall in 1811,\r\nwhen that organization found its quarters in Martling’s Tavern--a few\r\ndoors south, on part of the site of the present Tribune Building--too\r\nsmall for its robust membership.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Grand Sachems William Mooney, Matthew L. Davis, Lorenzo\r\nB. Shepard, Elijah F. Purdy, Isaac V. Fowler, Nelson J. Waterbury, and\r\nWilliam D. Kennedy, and the big and little bosses, including Tweed,\r\nthis third-floor room had been used as a general meeting-hall. It\r\nwas here, in 1835, that the Locofoco--later the Equal Rights--party\r\nwas born after a conflict in which the regular Tammany men, finding\r\nthemselves in the minority, turned off the gas and left the reformers\r\nto meet by the light of locofoco matches. It was a room from which many\r\na Democrat was hurled because he preferred De Witt Clinton to Tammany’s\r\nfavourite, Martin Van Buren. Two flights of long, straight stairs led\r\nto the ground floor. They were hard to go up; they must have been\r\nextremely painful to go down bouncing.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, wide, barnlike room, lighted by five windows that looked\r\nupon Park Row and the City Hall. The stout old timbers were bare in\r\nthe ceiling and in them were embedded various hooks and ring-bolts to\r\nwhich, once upon a time, was attached gymnasium apparatus used by a\r\n_turn verein_, which hired the room when the Tammanyites did not need\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt was not a beautiful room. Mr. Dana never did anything to improve\r\nit except in a utilitarian way, and from the time when he bought the\r\nbuilding from the Tammany Society, in 1867, until it was torn down\r\nin 1915, the old place looked very much the same. Of course, new\r\ngas-jets were added, these to be followed by electric-light wires,\r\nuntil the upper air had a jungle-like appearance, and there were rude,\r\ninexpensive desks and telephone-booths.\r\n\r\nThe floor was efficient, for it was covered with rubber matting that\r\ndeadened alike the quick footstep of Dana and the thundering stride\r\nof pugilistic champions who came in to see the sporting editor. But\r\nthe city room’s only ornaments were men and their genius. Here wrote\r\nRalph and Chamberlin, Spears and Irwin, and all the rest of the fine\r\nreporters of the old building’s years.\r\n\r\nNear the windows of this shabby room were the desks of the men who\r\nplanned news-hunts, chose the hunters, and mounted their trophies. Six\r\ndesks handled all the news-matter in the old city room of the _Sun_.\r\nThe managing editor sat at a roll-top in the northwest corner, near a\r\ndoor that led to Mr. Dana’s room. A little distance to the east was\r\nthe night editor’s desk. At the large flat-top desk near the managing\r\neditor three men sat--the cable editor, who handled all foreign news;\r\nthe “Albany man,” who edited articles from the State and national\r\ncapitals and all of New York State; and the telegraph editor, who\r\ntook care of all other wire matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    CHESTER SANDERS LORD\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the southwest corner of the room was a double desk at which the city\r\neditor sat from 10 A.M. until 5 P.M., when the night city editor came\r\nin. Next to the city editor’s desk was the roll-top of the assistant\r\ncity editor, also used by the assistant night city editor. Beyond that\r\nwas the desk of the suburban or “Jersey” editor. Nearest the door, so\r\nthat the noise of ten-thousand-dollar challenges to twenty-round combat\r\nwould not disturb the whole room, was the desk of the sporting editor.\r\n\r\nIn the fifty years that have passed since Dana bought the _Sun_, the\r\nchanges in the heads of the news departments have been comparatively\r\nfew. True, the news office has not been as fortunate as the editorial\r\nrooms, where only three men, Charles A. Dana, Paul Dana, and Edward P.\r\nMitchell, have been actual editors-in-chief; but the list of managing\r\neditors and night city editors is not long. Before the day of Chester\r\nS. Lord, the managing editors were, in order: Isaac W. England, Amos J.\r\nCummings, William Young, and Ballard Smith. Since Lord’s retirement the\r\nmanaging editors have been James Luby, William Harris, and Keats Speed.\r\n\r\nThe city editors have been John Williams, Larry Kane, W. M. Rosebault,\r\nWilliam Young, John B. Bogart (1873–1890), Daniel F. Kellogg\r\n(1890–1902), George B. Mallon (1902–1914), and Kenneth Lord, the\r\npresent city editor, a son of Chester S. Lord.\r\n\r\nThe night city editors before the long reign of Selah Merrill\r\nClarke--of whom more will be said presently--were Henry W. Odion,\r\nElijah M. Rewey, and Ambrose W. Lyman, all of whom had previously been\r\n_Sun_ reporters, and all of whom remained with the _Sun_, in various\r\ncapacities, for many years. Rewey was the exchange editor from 1887 to\r\n1903, and was variously employed at other important desk posts until\r\nhis death in 1916. Since Mr. Clarke’s retirement, in 1912, the night\r\ncity editors have been Joseph W. Bishop, J. W. Phoebus, Eugene Doane,\r\nMarion G. Scheitlin, and M. A. Rose.\r\n\r\nThe night editors of the _Sun_, whose function it is to make up the\r\npaper and to “sit in” when the managing editors are absent, have been\r\nDr. John B. Wood, the “great American condenser”; Garret P. Serviss,\r\nnow with the _Evening Journal_; Charles M. Fairbanks, Carr V. Van Anda\r\n(1893–1904), now managing editor of the New York _Times_; George M.\r\nSmith (1904–1912), the present managing editor of the _Evening Sun_;\r\nand Joseph W. Bishop.\r\n\r\nIn the eighties, the nineties, and the first decade of the present\r\ncentury the front corners of the city room were occupied, six nights\r\na week, by two men closely identified with the _Sun’s_ progress in\r\ngetting and preparing news. These, Chester S. Lord and S. M. Clarke,\r\nwere looked up to by _Sun_ men, and by Park Row generally, as essential\r\nparts of the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nLord, through his city editors, reporters, and correspondents, got the\r\nnews. If it was metropolitan news--and until the latter days of July,\r\n1914, New York was the news-centre of the world, so far as American\r\npapers were concerned--Clarke helped to get it and then to present it\r\nafter the unapproachably artistic manner of the _Sun_. In the years\r\nof Lord and Clarke more than a billion copies of the _Sun_ went out\r\ncontaining news stories written by men whom Lord had hired and whose\r\nwork had passed beneath the hand of Clarke.\r\n\r\nChester Sanders Lord, who was managing editor of the _Sun_ from 1880\r\nto 1913, was born in Romulus, New York, in 1850, the son of the Rev.\r\nEdward Lord, a Presbyterian clergyman who was chaplain of the One\r\nHundred and Tenth Regiment of New York Volunteer Infantry in the Civil\r\nWar. Chester Lord studied at Hamilton College in 1869 and 1870, and\r\nwent from college to be associate editor of the Oswego _Advertiser_.\r\nIn 1872 he came to the _Sun_ as a reporter, and covered part of Horace\r\nGreeley’s campaign for the Presidency in that year. After nine months\r\nas a reporter he was assigned by the managing editor, Cummings, to the\r\nsuburban desk, where he remained for four years.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1877 he bought the Syracuse _Standard_, but in six weeks\r\nhe returned to the _Sun_ and became assistant night city editor under\r\nAmbrose W. Lyman, the predecessor of S. M. Clarke. Ballard Smith, who\r\nsucceeded William Young as managing editor in 1878, named Lord as his\r\nassistant, and Lord succeeded Ballard Smith as managing editor on\r\nDecember 3, 1880.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-three years Lord inspected applicants for places in the news\r\ndepartments of the _Sun_, and decided whether they would fit into the\r\nhuman structure that Dana had built. Edward G. Riggs, who knew him as\r\nwell as any one, has written thus of him:\r\n\r\n    Like Dana, he has been a great judge of men. His discernment\r\n    has been little short of miraculous. Calm, dispassionate,\r\n    without the slightest atom of impulse, as wise as a serpent and\r\n    as gentle as a dove, Lord got about him a staff that has been\r\n    regarded by newspapermen as the most brilliant in the country.\r\n    Independent of thought, with a placid idea of the dignity of\r\n    his place, ever ready to concede the other fellow’s point of\r\n    view even though maintaining his own, Lord was never known in\r\n    all the years of his managing editorship of the _Sun_ to utter\r\n    an unkind word to any man on the paper, no matter how humble\r\n    his station.\r\n\r\nOne of Lord’s notable performances as managing editor was the\r\nperfecting of the _Sun’s_ system of collecting election returns.\r\nBefore 1880 the correspondents had sent in the election figures in\r\na conscientious but rather inefficient manner--by towns, or cities.\r\nLord picked out a reliable correspondent in each county of New York\r\nState and gave to the chosen man the responsibility of sending to the\r\n_Sun_, at nine o’clock on election night, an estimate of the result in\r\nhis particular county. This was to be followed at eleven o’clock, if\r\nnecessary, with the corrected figures.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell us how your city, or township, or village went,” he said\r\nto the correspondents. “Let us have your best estimate on the county.\r\nDon’t spare the telephone or the telegraph, either to collect the\r\nreturns or to get them into the _Sun_ office.”\r\n\r\nThe telephone was just coming into general use for the transmission of\r\nnews, and Lord saw its possibilities on an election night.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the new system, improved from year to year, the\r\n_Sun_ became what it is--the election-night authority on what has\r\nhappened. So confident was the _Sun_ of its figures on the night of\r\nthe Presidential election of 1884 that it, alone of all the New York\r\npapers, declared the next morning that Mr. Cleveland had defeated Mr.\r\nBlaine, although the _Sun_ had been one of the most strenuous opponents\r\nof the Democratic candidate. Blaine, who had wired to the _Sun_ for\r\nits estimates, got the first news of his defeat from Lord. Eight years\r\nlater, when Mr. Cleveland defeated President Harrison, the winner’s\r\npolitical chief of staff, Daniel S. Lamont, received the first tidings\r\nof the great and unexpected victory from Mr. Lord.\r\n\r\nIn the late eighties the _Sun_ was supplementing its Associated Press\r\nnews service with a valuable corps of special correspondents scattered\r\nall over America and Europe. The news received from these _Sun_ men\r\nled to the establishment, by William M. Laffan, then publisher of the\r\n_Sun_, of a _Sun_ news agency which was called the Laffan Bureau. This\r\nservice, originated for the purpose of covering special events in the\r\nlive way of the _Sun_, was suddenly called upon to cover the whole news\r\nfield of the world in a more comprehensive way.\r\n\r\nLord’s part in this work, when Dana decided to break with the\r\nAssociated Press, has been graphically described by Mr. Riggs:\r\n\r\n    “Chester,” said Mr. Dana one afternoon early in the nineties,\r\n    leaning over Lord’s desk, “I have just torn up my Associated\r\n    Press franchise. We’ve got to have the news of the world\r\n    to-morrow morning, and we’ve got to get it ourselves.”\r\n\r\n    “Don’t let that fret you, Mr. Dana,” replied Lord. “You’ve got\r\n    a Dante class on hand to-night. You just go home and enjoy\r\n    yourself. I’ll have the news for you all right.”\r\n\r\n    Dana always said that he didn’t enjoy his Dante class a single\r\n    bit that night; but he didn’t go near the _Sun_ office, neither\r\n    did he communicate with the office. He banked on Lord, and\r\n    the next morning and ever afterward Lord made good on the\r\n    independent service. He built up the Laffan Bureau, which more\r\n    recently has become the Sun News Service, and the special\r\n    correspondents of the paper in all parts of the world see to it\r\n    that the _Sun_ gets the news.\r\n\r\n    A task like that which Dana thrust on Lord might have paralyzed\r\n    the average managing editor of a great metropolitan newspaper\r\n    confronted by keen and powerful competitors. It was unheard of\r\n    in journalism. It had never been attempted before. Lord, with\r\n    calm courage and confidence, sent off thousands of telegrams\r\n    and cable despatches that night. Many were shots in the air,\r\n    but the majority were bull’s-eyes, as the next morning’s issue\r\n    of the _Sun_ proved.\r\n\r\n    Was Dana delighted? If you had seen him hop, skip, and jump\r\n    into the office that morning, you’d have received your answer.\r\n    When Lord turned up at his desk in the afternoon, Dana rushed\r\n    out from his chief editor’s office, grasped him about the\r\n    shoulders, and chuckled:\r\n\r\n    “Chester, you’re a brick, you’re a trump. You’re the John L.\r\n    Sullivan of newspaperdom!”\r\n\r\nThe Laffan Bureau, which assimilated the old United Press, became a\r\nnews syndicate the service of which was sought by dozens of American\r\npapers whose editors admired the _Sun’s_ manner of handling news. The\r\nLaffan Bureau lasted until 1916, when the _Sun_, through its purchase\r\nby Frank A. Munsey, absorbed Mr. Munsey’s New York _Press_, which had\r\nthe Associated Press service.\r\n\r\nAmong Mr. Lord’s fortunate traits as managing editor were his ability\r\nto choose good correspondents all over the world and his entire\r\nconfidence in them after they were selected. No matter what other\r\ncorrespondents wrote, the _Sun_ stood by its own men. They were on the\r\nspot; they should know the truth as well as any one else could.\r\n\r\nMonths before Aguinaldo’s insurrection the _Sun_ man at Manila, P. G.\r\nMcDonnell, kept insisting that the Filipino chieftain would revolt. The\r\nother New York newspapers laughed at the _Sun_ for seeing ghosts, but\r\nMcDonnell was right.\r\n\r\nNewspaper readers will remember that in 1904 the fall of Port Arthur\r\nwas announced three or four times in about as many months, and each\r\ntime the _Sun_ appeared to be beaten on the news until the next day,\r\nwhen it was discovered that the Russians were still holding out. All\r\nthe _Sun_ did about the matter was to notify its Tokyo correspondent,\r\nJohn T. Swift, that when Port Arthur really fell it would expect to\r\nhear from him by cable at “double urgent” rates. At midnight of\r\nJanuary 1, 1905, four months after these instructions were given to\r\nSwift, the _Sun_ got a “double urgent” message:\r\n\r\n    Port Arthur fallen--SWIFT.\r\n\r\nNo other paper in New York had the news. The _Sun_ rubbed it in\r\neditorially on January 3:\r\n\r\n    Deeply conscious as we are of the deplorable lack of modern\r\n    enterprise which has hitherto deprived the _Sun_ of the\r\n    distinction of repeatedly announcing the fall of Port Arthur,\r\n    we have to content ourselves with the reflection that when\r\n    finally the _Sun_ did print the fall of Port Arthur, it was so.\r\n\r\nSoon after the election of Woodrow Wilson, in 1912, the head of the\r\n_Sun_ bureau in Washington, the late Elting A. Fowler, made the\r\nprediction that William Jennings Bryan would be named as Secretary of\r\nState. Nearly every other metropolitan newspaper either ignored the\r\nstory, or ridiculed it as absurd and impossible. The _Sun_ never made\r\ninquiry of Fowler as to the source of his information. He had been\r\na _Sun_ man for ten years, and that was enough. Fowler repeated and\r\nreiterated that Bryan would be the head of the new Cabinet, and sure\r\nenough, he was.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ correspondent in a city five hundred miles from New York was\r\ncovering a great murder mystery. Every other New York newspaper of\r\nimportance had sent from two to five men to handle the story; the _Sun_\r\nsent none. The correspondent saw that the New York men were getting\r\nsheaves of telegrams from their newspapers, directing them in detail\r\nhow to tell the story, and to what length; so he sent a message to the\r\n_Sun_ advising it of the large numbers of New York reporters engaged on\r\nthe mystery, and of the amount of matter they were preparing to send.\r\nHad the _Sun_ any instructions for him? Yes, it had. The reply came\r\nswiftly:\r\n\r\n    Use your own judgment--CHESTER S. LORD.\r\n\r\nThat was the _Sun_ way, and the _Sun_ printed the correspondent’s\r\nstories, whether they were one column long, or six. The _Sun_ could not\r\nsee how an editor in New York could know more about a distant murder\r\nthan a correspondent on the spot.\r\n\r\nIt was the _Sun’s_ way, once a man was taken on, to keep him as long\r\nas it could. One day Mr. Lord sent for Samuel Hopkins Adams, then a\r\nreporter, and asked him whether he would like to go away fishing.\r\n\r\n“A Sunday story?” inquired Adams.\r\n\r\n“No, not exactly,” said Mr. Lord. “A vacation, rather. You’ve been\r\nfired. Go away, but come back, say, next Tuesday, and go to work, and\r\nit’ll be all right. Don’t worry!”\r\n\r\nAdams learned that a suit for libel had been brought against the paper\r\nby an individual who had been made an unpleasant figure in a police\r\nstory which Adams had written.\r\n\r\nA few days after Adams returned to his duties Mr. Dana came out of his\r\nroom and asked the city editor, Mr. Kellogg, the name of the reporter\r\nwho had written an article to which he pointed. Kellogg told Dana that\r\nAdams was the author, and Dana strode across the room and bestowed upon\r\nthe reporter one of his brief and much prized commentaries of approval.\r\nThen he looked at Adams more closely, and, with raised eyebrows, walked\r\nto the managing editor’s desk.\r\n\r\n“Who is that young man?” he asked Mr. Lord, indicating Adams with a\r\nmovement of the head.\r\n\r\nMr. Lord murmured something.\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I order him discharged a few days ago?” said Mr. Dana.\r\n\r\nAnother but more prolonged murmur from Mr. Lord. Adams got up from his\r\ndesk to efface himself, but as he left the room he caught the voice of\r\nMr. Dana, a trifle higher and a bit plaintive:\r\n\r\n“Why is it, Mr. Lord, that I never succeed in discharging any of your\r\nbright young men?”\r\n\r\nAdams did not wait for the answer.\r\n\r\nThis story, while typical of Lord, is not typical of Dana. For\r\nevery word of censure he had a hundred words of praise. He read the\r\npaper--every line of it--for virtues to be commended rather than for\r\nfaults to be condemned.\r\n\r\n“Who wrote the two sticks about the lame girl? A good touch; that’s the\r\n_Sun_ idea!”\r\n\r\nIf a new man had written something he liked--even a ten-line\r\nparagraph--the editor of the _Sun_ would cross the room to shake the\r\nman’s hand and say:\r\n\r\n“Good work!”\r\n\r\nThe spirit he radiated was contagious. The men, encouraged by Dana,\r\nspread faith to one another. The “_Sun_” spirit--the envious of other\r\nnewspapers were wont to refer to those who had it as “the _Sun’s_\r\nMutual Admiration Society”--did and does much to make the _Sun_. The\r\nmen lived the socialism of art. If a new reporter received a difficult\r\nassignment, ten older men were ready to tell him, in a kindly and not\r\nat all didactic way, how to find the short cut.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some part of the democracy of the _Sun_ office has come from\r\nthe fact that men have rarely been taken in at the top. It was Dana’s\r\nplan to catch young men with unformed ideas of journalism and make\r\n_Sun_ men of them. They went on the paper as cubs at fifteen dollars a\r\nweek--or even as office-boys--and worked their way to be “space men,”\r\nif they had it in their noddles.\r\n\r\nAll space men were free and equal in the Jeffersonian sense. Their pay\r\nwas eight dollars a column. That one man made one hundred and fifty\r\ndollars in a week when his neighbour made only fifty was usually the\r\nresult, not of the system, but of the difference between the men. Some\r\nwere harder workers than others, or better fitted by experience for\r\nmore important stories; and some were born money-makers. If a diligent\r\nreporter, through no fault of his own, was making small “bills,”\r\nthe city editor would see to it that something profitable fell to\r\nhim--perhaps a long and easily written Sunday article.\r\n\r\nThrough changed conditions in newspaper make-up and policies, the space\r\nsystem in the payment of reporters is now practically extinct. It had\r\ngood points and bad ones. Undoubtedly it developed a large number of\r\nmen to whom a salary would not have been attractive. Some, to whose\r\nstyle and activities the space system lent itself, remained in the\r\nprofession longer than they would otherwise have stayed. On the other\r\nhand, it was not always fair to reporters with whom a condensed style\r\nwas natural. The dynamics of a two-inch article, the very value of\r\nwhich lies in its brevity, cannot be measured with a space-rule.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ ideas of fairness do not end with itself and its men.\r\nIt has always had a proper consideration for the feelings of the\r\ninnocent bystander. It never harms the weak, or stoops to get news in\r\na dishonourable or unbecoming way. It would be hard to devise a set of\r\nrules of newspaper ethics, but a few examples of things that the _Sun_\r\ndoesn’t do may illuminate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    SELAH MERRILL CLARKE\r\n]\r\n\r\nSoon after one of the _Sun’s_ most brilliant reporters had come on the\r\npaper, he was sent to report the wedding of a noted sporting man and\r\na famous stage beauty, the marriage ceremony being performed by a\r\npicturesque Tammany alderman. The reporter returned to the office with\r\na lot of amusing detail, which he recited in brief to the night city\r\neditor.\r\n\r\n“Just the facts of the marriage, please,” said Mr. Clarke. “The two\r\nmost important events in the life of a woman are her marriage and her\r\ndeath. Neither should be treated flippantly.”\r\n\r\nAnother reporter wrote an amusing story about a fat policeman posted\r\nat the Battery, who chased a tramp through a pool of rain-water. The\r\npoliceman fell into the water, and the tramp got away. No report of the\r\noccurrence was made at police headquarters, but a _Sun_ man saw the\r\nincident and wrote it.\r\n\r\n“It’s an amusing story,” said Clarke to the reporter, “but they read\r\nthe papers at police headquarters, and this policeman may be put on\r\ntrial for not reporting the escape of the hobo. Suppose we drop this\r\nclassic on the floor?”\r\n\r\nA telegraph messenger-boy once wrote a letter to the police\r\ncommissioner, telling him how to break up the cadets (panders) of the\r\nEast Side. A _Sun_ man found the lad and got an interesting interview\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n“Leave my name out, won’t you?” the messenger said to the reporter. “If\r\nyou print it, I may lose my job.”\r\n\r\nHe was told that his name was known in the _Sun_ office, but that the\r\nreporter would present his appeal.\r\n\r\n“Did you find the messenger?” Clarke asked the reporter on his arrival.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ man replied that he had found him, and that the interview was\r\ninteresting and exclusive. Before he had an opportunity to repeat the\r\nboy’s plea for anonymity, Clarke said:\r\n\r\n“Is it going to hurt the boy if we print his name? If it is, leave it\r\nout, and refer to him by a fictitious number.”\r\n\r\nTwo reporters, one from the _Sun_ and one from another big daily, went\r\none night to interview a famous man on an important subject. The _Sun_\r\nman returned and wrote a brief story containing none of the big news\r\nwhich it had been hoped he might get. The other newspaper came out with\r\nsome startling revelations, gleaned from the same interview. Mr. Lord\r\nshowed the rival paper’s article to the _Sun_ reporter, with a mild\r\ninquiry as to the reason for the _Sun’s_ failure to get the news.\r\n\r\n“We both gave our word,” said the reporter, “that we would keep back\r\nthat piece of news for three days, even from our offices.”\r\n\r\n“Son,” said Mr. Lord, “you are a great man!”\r\n\r\nThat was the Lord phrase of acquittal.\r\n\r\nOne of the big occurrences in the investigation of the life-insurance\r\ncompanies in 1905 was a report which was read to the investigating\r\ncommittee in executive session. Every newspaper yearned for the\r\ncontents of the document. After the committee adjourned, a member of it\r\nwhispered to a _Sun_ reporter:\r\n\r\n“There is a bundle of those reports just inside the door of the\r\ncommittee room. I should think that five dollars given to a scrub-woman\r\nwould probably get a copy for you.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ man, knowing the value of the report, and not content to act\r\non his own estimate of _Sun_ ethics, telephoned the temptation to the\r\ncity editor, Mr. Mallon.\r\n\r\n“A _Sun_ man who would do that would lose his job,” was the instant\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nA couple of days after Stephen Tyng Mather, recently First Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Interior, went on the _Sun_ as a reporter, the city\r\neditor, Mr. Bogart, called him to his desk.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mather,” said Bogart, “an admirer of the _Sun_ has sent me a\r\nturkey. Of course, I cannot accept it. Please take it to his house in\r\nHarlem and explain why; but don’t hurt his feelings.”\r\n\r\nMather had just come from college, where he had never learned that the\r\nethics of journalism might require a reporter to become a deliverer of\r\npoultry, but he took the turkey. It does not detract from the moral of\r\nthe story to say that Mather and another young reporter, neither quite\r\nunderstanding the _Sun’s_ stern code, took the bird to the Fellowcraft\r\nClub and had it roasted--a fact of which Mr. Bogart may have been\r\nunaware until now.\r\n\r\nThe best news-handler that journalism has seen, Selah Merrill Clarke,\r\nwas night city editor of the _Sun_ for thirty-one years. He came to the\r\npaper in 1881 from the New York _World_, where he had been employed\r\nas a reporter, and later as a desk man. In the early seventies he\r\nwrote for the _World_ a story of a suicide, and one of the newspapers\r\nof that day said of it that neither Dickens nor Wilkie Collins, with\r\nall the time they could ask, could have surpassed it. His story of\r\nthe milkman’s ride down the valley of the Mill River, warning the\r\ninhabitants that the dam had broken at the Ashfield reservoir, near\r\nNorthampton, Massachusetts (May 16, 1874), was another classic that\r\nattracted the attention of editors, including Dana.\r\n\r\nClarke never thought well of himself as a reporter, and often said that\r\nin that capacity he was a failure. As a judge of news values, or news\r\npresentation, or as a giver of the fine literary touch which lent to\r\nthe _Sun’s_ articles that indescribable tone not found in other papers,\r\nClarke stood almost alone.\r\n\r\nThe city editor of a New York newspaper sows seeds; the night city\r\neditor re-seeds barren spots, waters wilting items, and cuts and\r\nbags the harvest. The city editor sends men out all day for news; the\r\nnight city editor judges what they bring in, and decides what space it\r\nshall have. In the handling of a big story, on which five or fifteen\r\nreporters may be engaged, the night city editor has to put together as\r\nmany different writings in such a way that the reader may go smoothly\r\nfrom beginning to end. Chance may decree that the poorest writer has\r\nbrought in the biggest news, and the man on the desk must supply\r\nquality as well as judgment.\r\n\r\nAt such work Clarke was a master. It has been said of him that by the\r\neliding stroke of his pencil and the insertion of perhaps a single word\r\nhe could change the commonplace to literature. No reporter ever worked\r\non the _Sun_ but wished, at one time or another, to thank Clarke for\r\nsaving him from himself. Clarke had the faculty of seeing instantly the\r\nopportunity for improvement that the reporter might have seen an hour\r\nor a day later.\r\n\r\nClarke got about New York very little, but he knew the city from Arthur\r\nKill to Pelham Bay; knew it just as a general at headquarters knows\r\nthe terrain on which his troops are fighting, but which he himself has\r\nnever seen. He had the map of New York in his brain. When an alarm\r\nof fire came in from an obscure corner, he knew what lumber-yards or\r\noil-refineries were near the blaze, and whether that was a point where\r\nthe water pressure was likely to fail.\r\n\r\nClarke’s memory was uncanny; it seemed to have photographed every issue\r\nof the _Sun_ for years. It was a saying that while Clarke stayed the\r\n_Sun_ needed neither an index nor a “morgue”--that biographical cabinet\r\nin which newspapers keep records of men and affairs.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years after the Beecher-Tilton trial a three-line\r\ndeath-notice came to Clarke’s desk. He read the dead man’s name and\r\nsummoned a reporter.\r\n\r\n“This man was a juror in the Beecher case,” said Clarke. “Look in the\r\nfile of February 6 or 7, 1875, and I think you’ll find that this man\r\nstood up and made an interruption. Write a little piece about it.”\r\n\r\nA _Sun_ man who reported the funeral of Russell Sage at Lawrence, Long\r\nIsland, in July, 1906, returned to the office and told Mr. Clarke that\r\nan acquaintance of the Sage family had told him, on the train coming\r\nback, the contents of the old man’s will--a document for which the\r\nreading public eagerly waited. The reporter laid his informant’s card\r\nbefore the night city editor. Clarke studied the name on it for a\r\nminute, and then said:\r\n\r\n“We won’t print the story. Dig out the file for June, 1899, and\r\nsomewhere on the front page--I think it will be in the third or fourth\r\ncolumn--on the 1st or 2nd of June you’ll find a story telling that this\r\nman was sent to Sing Sing for forgery.”\r\n\r\nClarke’s memory was right. Although it is anti-climactic to relate\r\nit, the ex-convict’s description of what the will contained was also\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nWill Irwin, while reporting a small war between two Chinese societies,\r\nwrote an article one night about the arrest of two Hip Sing tong\r\nmen who were wearing chain armour under their blouses. Clarke, much\r\ninterested, asked Irwin all about the armour.\r\n\r\n“It reminds me of ‘King Solomon’s Mines,’” remarked Irwin, “and the\r\nchain armour that the heroes had made in Sheffield to wear in Africa.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Clarke, who had not read the Haggard novel in fifteen\r\nyears; “but it wasn’t Sheffield--it was Birmingham.”\r\n\r\nClarke had a sense of responsibility that showed itself in nervousness.\r\nOn a night when news was breaking, that nervousness was exhibited in\r\nhis trips, every ten minutes, to the ice-water tank; in the constant\r\nlighting and relighting of his pipe; in the quick turn of his head at\r\nthe approach of a reporter. Yet his nervousness was not contagious. So\r\nlong as Clarke was nervous, the men under him felt that they need not\r\nbe. He did all the worrying, and, unlike most worriers, got results\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nLet him know that something had happened in the city, and his drag-net\r\nsystem was started. No matter how remote the happening, how apparently\r\nhopeless the clue, he let neither man nor telephone rest until every\r\npossible corner had been searched for the guilty news item. Once the\r\nsituation was in hand he would return to the adornment of a head-line\r\nor the working out of some abstruse problem in mathematics--perhaps the\r\nangles of a sun-dial, for Clarke’s hobby was gnomonics, and he knew\r\ndials from Ptolemy’s time down. As a rest from mathematics he might\r\nwrite a limerick in Greek, and then carefully tear it up.\r\n\r\nAlmost every newspaper in New York tried, at one time or another, to\r\ntake Clarke from the _Sun_. One night an emissary from one of the\r\napostles of the then new journalism entered the _Sun_ office and\r\nsent his card to Mr. Clarke. When the night city editor appeared, he\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n“Mr. ---- says that if you’ll ascertain the highest salary the _Sun_\r\nwill pay you to stay, he’ll double it.”\r\n\r\nClarke uttered the strange sound that was his indulgence when\r\ndisagreeably disturbed--a cross between a growl and a grunt--and turned\r\nback toward his desk.\r\n\r\n“He’ll triple it!” cried the tempter.\r\n\r\nAlthough Clarke heard the words, he kept on to his desk, and not only\r\nnever mentioned the matter, but probably never thought of it again.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he made a notable trip to the gate at the entrance\r\nto the big room. A drunken visitor was making the place ring with\r\nyells, and the office-boys could not stop him. Clarke bore the noise\r\nfor ten minutes, and then, remarking, “This is unendurable!” went and\r\nthrew the man down the stairs.\r\n\r\nClarke was the hero of a dozen newspaper stories, which he scorned to\r\nread.\r\n\r\n“Do you know, Mr. Clarke,” said a reporter who did not know how shy\r\n“the boss” was, “that Blank has put you into a short story in _Space’s\r\nMagazine_?”\r\n\r\n“Who is Blank?” said Clarke shortly.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said his informant, “he worked here for several weeks.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord!” said Clarke. “I can’t be expected, can I, to remember all\r\nthe geniuses that come and go?”\r\n\r\nThere was a mild ferocity about him that caused more than one cub to\r\nthink that the night boss was unfriendly, but this attitude had a good\r\neffect. No young reporter ever made the same mistake twice.\r\n\r\n“If you mean ‘child,’ write it so,” he would say. “Don’t write it\r\n‘tot.’ And please have more variety in your motor cars. I have seen\r\nseveral that were not large and red and high-powered.”\r\n\r\nThe head-lines of the _Sun_ have been well written since the first days\r\nof Dana, and Clarke, for thirty years, was the best of the head-line\r\nwriters. He wrote rhyming heads for Sam Wood’s prose verse, satirical\r\nheads for satires, humorous heads for the funny men’s articles. A\r\n_Sun_ reader could gauge almost exactly the worth of an article by the\r\nquality of the heading. A _Sun_ reporter could tell just what Clarke\r\nthought of his story by the cleverness of the lines that the night\r\ncity editor wrote above it.\r\n\r\nClarke would put the obvious heading on a long, matter-of-fact yarn\r\nin two minutes, but he might spend half an hour--if he had it to\r\nspare--polishing a head for a short and sparkling piece of work. Two\r\narchitects who did city work pleaded poverty, but admitted having\r\nturned over property to their wives. Clarke headed the story:\r\n\r\n    “We’re Broke,” Says Horgan.--“Sure,” Says Slattery, “But Our\r\n    Wives Are Doing Fine.”\r\n\r\nA brief item about the arrest of some boys for stealing five copies of\r\n“The Simple Life” he headed “Tempted Beyond Their Strength.” Over a\r\nparagraph telling of the killing of a Park Row newsboy by a truck he\r\nwrote: “A Sparrow Falls.”\r\n\r\nClarke had a besetting fear that Russell Sage would die suddenly late\r\nat night, and that the _Sun_ would not learn of it in time. Again and\r\nagain false “hunches” caused him to send men to the Sage home on Fifth\r\nAvenue to discover the state of the old millionaire’s health. When Mr.\r\nSage became seriously ill, reporters were sent in relays to watch the\r\nhouse. One man who had such an assignment turned up at the _Sun_ office\r\nat one o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n“I left Mr. Sage’s house,” he explained to Clarke, “because Dr. Blank\r\njust came out and I had a little talk with him. He asked me if S. M.\r\nClarke was still night city editor of the _Sun_; and when I told him\r\nthat you were, he said:\r\n\r\n“‘Tell Selah for me that I will call him personally on the ’phone if\r\nthere is the least change in Mr. Sage’s condition. Selah and I are old\r\nfriends; we used to be room-mates in college.’”\r\n\r\n“Blank always was a darn liar!” said Mr. Clarke. “Go back to the house\r\nand sit on the door-step.”\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 1917, five years after Clarke retired, the Sun Alumni\r\nAssociation gave a dinner in his honour, with Mr. Lord presiding. Men\r\ncame five hundred miles for the event, and the speeches were entirely\r\nabout Clarke and his work. Mr. Clarke himself, who was only five miles\r\naway, sent a kindly letter to say that he was pleased, but that he\r\ncould not imagine anything more absurd than a man’s attending a dinner\r\ngiven in his own honour.\r\n\r\nClarke was a factor in that nebulous institution so frequently referred\r\nto as the “_Sun_ school of journalism,” a college in which the teaching\r\nwas by example rather than precept. Clarke occasionally told the young\r\nreporters how not to do it, but his real lessons were given in the\r\ncolumns of the _Sun_. There, in cold type, the man could see that\r\nClarke had thrown his beautiful introduction on the floor, had lifted a\r\nword or a phrase from the middle of the article and put it to the fore,\r\nor had, by one of the touches which marked the great copy-reader’s\r\ngenius, breathed life into the narrative. Clarke had no rules for\r\nimproving a story, but he had a faculty, not uncommon among the finest\r\ncopy-readers, of seeing an event more clearly than it had appeared to\r\nthe reporter who described it, even when the desk man’s information\r\ncame entirely from the reporter’s screed.\r\n\r\nIf a reporter found his story in the paper almost untouched by Clarke’s\r\npencil and adorned with a typical Clarkean head, it was a signal to\r\nhim that he had done well. He was sure not to get verbal approbation\r\nfrom Clarke. There is a legend that Clarke once cried “Fine!” after\r\nskimming over a sheet of well-written copy, but it is only a legend.\r\nWith a reporter who never wrote introductions and never padded his\r\narticles Clarke would sometimes crack a joke. _Sun_ traditions have it\r\nthat once, after a reporter had turned New York inside out to dig out\r\na particularly difficult piece of news, the night city editor remarked\r\nto his assistant that that reporter “was a handy man to have around the\r\noffice.” Although Clarke has been referred to by an excellent judge,\r\nWill Irwin, as “the greatest living schoolmaster of newspapermen,” his\r\nmethods could never be adapted to the academies of journalism.\r\n\r\nAs a schoolmaster of a more positive type, _Sun_ men remember the late\r\nFrancis T. Patton, who edited suburban news for twenty years. Staff\r\nmen on assignments in New Jersey, Westchester, Long Island, and other\r\nplaces just beyond the city turned in their copy to “Boss” Patton,\r\na cultured man who spent his spare hours reading old Latin works in\r\nthe original or working out chess problems. It was to him that the\r\nbewildered cub turned in his hour of torment, and Patton would tell him\r\nhow long his story ought to run, how he might begin it, how end it.\r\n\r\n“I know it isn’t right to fake, Mr. Patton,” said a new reporter; “but\r\nis exaggeration never permissible?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said Patton. “You may use exaggeration whenever it is needed\r\nto convey to the reader an adequate but not exaggerated picture of the\r\nevent you are describing. For instance, if you are reporting a storm at\r\nSeabright, and the waves are eight and one-half feet high by the tape\r\nwhich you surely carry in your hip-pocket for such emergencies, it will\r\nhardly do to inform the reader that the waves are eight and one-half\r\nfeet high; his visualization of the scene would not be perfect. Yet, if\r\nyou write that the waves ran mountain-high, I shall change your copy\r\nif it comes to me. The expression would be too stale. Hyperbole is one\r\nof the gifts.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL A. WOOD\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    OSCAR KING DAVIS\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    THOMAS M. DIEUAIDE\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    SAMUEL HOPKINS ADAMS\r\n]\r\n\r\nPatton’s droll humour was one of the delights of the _Sun_ office. One\r\nnight Charles M. Fairbanks was writing, for the _Herald_, a story about\r\n“The Men Who Make the _Sun_ Shine.” He asked Patton for something about\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n“You may say,” replied the boss of the suburban desk, “that my\r\ncharacteristics are brilliancy, trustworthiness, accuracy, and poetic\r\nfervour.”\r\n\r\n“Boss,” said a young reporter to Mr. Patton, “I often think you and I\r\ncould run this paper better than the men who are running it.”\r\n\r\n“How strange!” said Mr. Patton, looking surprised. “I know that I\r\ncould, but it has never occurred to me that you would not do worse than\r\nthey do.”\r\n\r\nThe sports department has been one of the _Sun’s_ strongholds since\r\nMr. Dana’s first years. Dana would let Amos Cummings give half a page\r\nto a race at Saratoga or Monmouth Park, and would encourage Amos to\r\nneglect his executive duties so that the paper might have a good report\r\nof a boxing-match. When William I lay dead in Berlin, the _Sun’s_\r\nprincipal European correspondent, Arthur Brisbane, was concerned,\r\nnot with the future of the continent, but with the aftermath of the\r\nSullivan-Mitchell fight at Chantilly.\r\n\r\nThe stories of the international yacht-races have always been told best\r\nin the _Sun_, whether the reporter was John R. Spears or William J.\r\nHenderson. Mr. Henderson, who is the ablest musical critic in America,\r\nis probably the best yachting reporter, too. While the world of music\r\nknows him through his distinguished critiques, particularly of opera,\r\nthe _Sun_ knows him as a great reporter--one who would rank high among\r\nthe best it has ever had. Another _Sun_ man who wrote yachting well is\r\nDuncan Curry, later of the _American_.\r\n\r\nIn turf matters the _Sun_ has long been looked upon as an authority.\r\nIn the heyday of racing the paper enjoyed the services of Christopher\r\nJ. Fitzgerald, since then familiar as a starter on many race-tracks,\r\nand of Joseph Vila, now sporting editor of the _Evening Sun_.\r\nFitzgerald, although a specialist in sports, was also a first-class\r\ngeneral reporter. He is the hero of a story of the proverbial “_Sun_\r\nluck,” which in this case might better be called _Sun_ persistence and\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of December, 1892, the steamship Umbria, the\r\nfastest transatlantic boat of her day, was two weeks overdue at New\r\nYork. Every newspaper had tugs out to watch for her first appearance.\r\nOn the night of December 28 Fitzgerald was assigned to tug duty. The\r\nfirst tug he took down the moonlit bay broke her propeller in the ice;\r\nwith the second tug he ran twenty miles beyond Sandy Hook. Presently\r\nan inward-bound liner appeared in the dark, and the other newspaper\r\nboats followed her; but this was not the Umbria, but the Britannic. An\r\nhour later a tank steamer came along, and Fitzgerald hailed her on the\r\nchance that she knew something about the missing ship.\r\n\r\n“The Umbria,” came back the answer, “is about five miles astern, coming\r\nin slowly.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ tug raced to sea and soon came alongside the overdue\r\nsteamer. On board was Frank Marshall White, the _Sun’s_ London\r\ncorrespondent, and he had, all ready written, a story telling how the\r\nUmbria broke her machinery, and how the chief engineer lay on his back\r\nfor five days trying to mend the break. Fitzgerald took White’s story\r\nand raced to Quarantine, where there was a telegraph-station, but, at\r\nthat hour, no operator. Fitzgerald, himself an expert telegrapher,\r\npounded the _Sun’s_ call, “SX,” for ten minutes, but the _Sun_ operator\r\nhad gone home.\r\n\r\nFitzgerald returned to the tug and went under full speed to the\r\nBattery, landing at 3.35 A.M. Running to Park Row, he found an\r\nassistant foreman of the _Sun_ composing-room enjoying his lemonade in\r\nAndy Horn’s restaurant. This man rounded up four or five printers, and\r\nthey began setting up the story at 4 A.M. The _Sun_ had a complete and\r\nexclusive story, and twenty thousand copies were sold of Fitzgerald’s\r\nextra.\r\n\r\nVila, like Fitzgerald a man of large physique and a former athlete,\r\nwrote the descriptions of a dozen Suburban Handicaps and Futurities,\r\nof a score of great college rowing-matches, of a thousand baseball\r\nand football games. Damon Runyon, the poet and sporting editor, once\r\nremarked that “Vila is the only sporting writer I have ever seen who\r\nknows exactly, at the end of a sporting event, just what he is going to\r\nwrite, when he is going to write it, and how much he is going to write.”\r\n\r\nWhen John W. Gates and John A. Drake came to the New York race-tracks\r\nand made bets of sensational magnitude, Vila was the only turf reporter\r\nable to give the exact figures of the amounts bet by the Western\r\nplungers. The printing of these in the _Sun_ so aroused the Jockey Club\r\nthat a curb was put on big betting.\r\n\r\nThe present sports staff includes some of the writers, like Nat\r\nFleischer, “Daniel,” Frederick G. Lieb, and George B. Underwood, who\r\nwere on the big sports staff of the New York _Press_ when that paper\r\nwas amalgamated with the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nReturning to the big, bare room in the old Sun Building, cast the eye\r\nof memory through the thin forest of chandeliers entwined with lianas\r\nof electric wiring, and across the dull desks. Boss Lord has come in\r\nfrom dinner and is reading telegraphic bulletins from out-of-town\r\ncorrespondents or glancing at a growing pile of proofs. At the Albany\r\ndesk Deacon Stillman is editing a batch of Congress news from Walter\r\nClarke or Richard V. Oulahan in Washington, or of legislative news from\r\nJoseph L. McEntee in Albany, or is trying to think out an apt head for\r\na double murder in Herkimer County. At the cable desk Cyrus C. Adams,\r\nlong secretary of the American Geographical Society, is looking in\r\na guide-book to discover whether the name of a street in Naples has\r\nnot been distorted by the operators while in transit between the Rome\r\ncorrespondent and New York. The telegraph editor is telling the night\r\neditor, Van Anda or Smith, that he has “nothing much but yellow fever,”\r\nand the night editor is replying that “three-quarters of a column of\r\nyellow fever will be plenty.”\r\n\r\nAt the city desk Clarke, who has half finished the heading on a bit\r\nabout a green heron seen in Bronx Park, picks up the telephone to\r\ntell an East Side police-station reporter to investigate the report\r\nof an excursion boat gone aground on Hart’s Island, and then turns\r\naway to tell Ralph, or Chamberlin, or Joseph Fox, or Irwin, or Hill,\r\nor O’Malley, that a column and a half lead will do for the police\r\ninvestigation, or the great public dinner, or whatever his task may\r\nhave been. As he finishes, a reporter lays on his desk a long story,\r\nand Clarke, reading the substance of the first page of it in an\r\ninstant, hands it over to his assistant to edit.\r\n\r\nAt the Jersey desk Boss Patton has polished the disquisitions of a\r\nsuburban correspondent on the antics of a shark in Barnegat Bay, and is\r\nexplaining to a space man, almost with tears, why it was necessary to\r\ncut down his article about the picnic of the Smith family at Peapack.\r\n\r\nThe sporting editor, John Mandigo, has just bade good night to some\r\ndistinguished visitor--say Mr. Fitzsimmons--and is bending over some\r\ncopy from Fitzgerald or Vila. Perhaps Henry of Navarre and Domino are\r\nnose-and-nose in the stretch at Gravesend, or Amos Rusie has struck out\r\nseventeen opposing batters, or Kid Lavigne has lambasted Joe Walcott\r\nquite properly at Maspeth.\r\n\r\nAt a side desk a copy-reader on local news is struggling with a mass\r\nof writing from various youthful reporters. “At seven ten o’clock last\r\nevening, as Policeman McGuffin was patrolling his beat, his attention\r\nwas attracted by a cry of fire,” etc. The copy-reader knows that smoke\r\nwill presently issue from the upper windows; knows, too, that he\r\npresently will boil the seven pages down to three lines and gently tell\r\nthe reporter why he did it.\r\n\r\nThe chess expert is turning a cabalistic cablegram from St. Petersburg\r\ninto a detailed story of the contest between a couple of the masters of\r\nthe game. The bowling man is writing a description, which may never see\r\nthe light, of a desperate struggle between the Harlem Pin Kings and the\r\nBensonhurst Alley Scorchers. H. L. Fitzpatrick is writing a golf story\r\nwith such magnificent technique that Mandigo will not dare to cut a\r\nline out of it.\r\n\r\nA dozen reporters, great and small, are at the desks in the middle\r\nof the room, busy with pencils. In a side room three or four others,\r\nconverts to the typewriter, are pounding out copy. In another room\r\nRiggs is dictating to a stenographer the day’s doings in political\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFour or five “rewrite men,” the “long wait” and his helpers, the\r\n“short waits,” are slipping in and out of the telephone-booths, taking\r\nand writing news articles from twenty points in the city where the\r\nMulberry Street reporter, the police-station reporters, the Tenderloin\r\nman--who covers the West Thirtieth Street police-station, the Broadway\r\nhotels, and the theatrical district--and the Harlem man are still busy\r\ngathering news.\r\n\r\nFrom a room wisely distant comes the rattle of the telegraph. Half a\r\ndozen wires are bringing in the continent’s news. Half a dozen boys,\r\nspurred by their chief, Dan O’Leary, carry the typed sheets to the\r\nproper desks.\r\n\r\nThe dramatic critic comes in and sits down at his desk to write\r\ntwo-thirds of a column about a first performance. The music critic has\r\nsent down a brief notice of the night’s opera.\r\n\r\nMost of the reporters finish their work and go out. One or two remain\r\nto write special articles for the Sunday papers. A sporting reporter is\r\nspinning a semi-fictional yarn of life in Chinatown. A police reporter\r\nis composing little classics of life in Dolan’s Park Row restaurant.\r\n\r\nAt one o’clock there is a rumbling of the presses in the basement, and\r\nsoon copies of the first edition come to the desks of the news-masters.\r\nLord suggests to the night editor a shift of front-page articles.\r\nClarke, his pencil flashing, marks in additions to the story of a late\r\naccident. A cub waits patiently for a discarded paper, to see whether\r\nhis piece has got in. An older reporter, who wrote the story in the\r\nfirst column of the first page, does not look at his own work, but\r\nturns to the sporting page to read the racing entries for the next\r\nday--his day off.\r\n\r\nAt 1.27 A.M. Clarke rises and goes home. At two o’clock Lord closes\r\nhis desk. Most of the desk men disappear; the work is done. The night\r\neditor--Van Anda or the imperturbable Smith--remains at his desk, with\r\nthe “long wait” reporter to bear him company. At half past three they\r\nalso go, and the watchman begins to turn out the lights. Down below,\r\nthe presses are tossing forth the product of a night’s work in the big,\r\nbare, old room.\r\n\r\nA story of the _Sun_ would be incomplete without a sketch of its little\r\nsister. The _Evening Sun_ was established by Mr. Dana nearly twenty\r\nyears after he bought the _Sun_. He saw a place for a one-cent evening\r\nnewspaper, for the only journal of that description then published in\r\nNew York was the _Daily News_, which was largely a class publication.\r\nThe leading evening newspapers were the _Evening Post_, the _Commercial\r\nAdvertiser_, and the _Mail and Express_, selling for three cents and\r\ncatering to a highbrow or a partisan clientele.\r\n\r\nThe first _Evening Sun_ was issued on March 17, 1887, at an hour when\r\nthe St. Patrick’s Day parade was being reviewed by Mayor Hewitt. With\r\nits four pages of six columns each, its brief, lively presentation\r\nof general news, and its low price, the paper was an immediate\r\nsuccess--though not the success that it is to-day, with its sixteen\r\npages, its wealth of special articles, and the many features that make\r\nit one of America’s best evening newspapers.\r\n\r\nThe new paper had no titular editor-in-chief. Mr. Dana was the editor\r\nof the _Sun_ and had the general guidance of the evening paper. Dana’s\r\nassociate, the publisher of the _Sun_, William M. Laffan, took a deep\r\ninterest in the welfare of the new venture, and the _Evening Sun_ was\r\noften referred to as his “baby.”\r\n\r\nThe first managing editor of the paper was Amos J. Cummings, with\r\nAllan Kelly as city editor and John McCormick as sporting editor. When\r\nCummings went to Congress, E. J. Edwards took his place and remained\r\nas managing editor until August, 1889, when Arthur Brisbane returned\r\nfrom the post of London correspondent of the _Sun_ to manage the\r\nevening paper.\r\n\r\nIt was Brisbane who induced Richard Harding Davis, then a young\r\nreporter in Philadelphia, to come to New York. As Davis was walking\r\nup from the ferry one morning in October, 1889, on his way to take\r\nup his new duties, he was taken in hand, in City Hall Park, by a\r\nbunco-steerer. Davis listened to the man’s wiles, turned him over to\r\nthe police of the City Hall station, and then hurried to the _Evening\r\nSun_ office to write a story about it for the paper. Davis’s _Van\r\nBibber_ stories, the first of his fiction to attract wide attention,\r\nwere originally printed in the _Evening Sun_, in 1890. As a reporter\r\nunder Brisbane, Davis picked up much of the information and experiences\r\nthat coloured his fiction.\r\n\r\nWhen Brisbane went to the Pulitzer forces, he was succeeded as managing\r\neditor by W. C. McCloy, who had been city editor, and who remained at\r\nthe head of the news department for more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nJacob A. Riis, who had been the police-headquarters reporter of the\r\n_Tribune_ since 1877, went to the _Evening Sun_ in 1890, coincident\r\nwith the publication of his first popular work, “How the Other Half\r\nLives.” Other of his works, including “The Children of the Poor” and\r\n“Out of Mulberry Street,” were written while he was the chief police\r\nreporter of the _Evening Sun_. Riis’s work was valuable, not only to\r\nthe paper, but to the city itself. His writings attracted the attention\r\nof Theodore Roosevelt when the future President was head of the police\r\nboard of New York (1895–1897), and the men became close friends.\r\nTogether they worked to improve conditions in the tenement districts,\r\nand Roosevelt called Riis “New York’s most useful citizen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    WILL IRWIN\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    FRANK WARD O’MALLEY\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    EDWIN C. HILL\r\n]\r\n\r\nThomas M. Dieuaide, whose work for the _Sun_ in the Spanish War has\r\nbeen referred to in this volume, and who became city editor of the\r\n_Evening Sun_, was one of Riis’s colleagues. Dieuaide was the author of\r\nthe _Evening Sun’s_ broadside against the black vice of the East Side.\r\nPrinted in 1901, shortly before the beginning of a mayoralty campaign,\r\nit was a prime factor in the election of a reforming administration.\r\n\r\nRichard Harding Davis was not the only fiction-writer to graduate\r\nfrom the _Evening Sun’s_ school. Irvin S. Cobb got his start in the\r\nNorth as an _Evening Sun_ reporter. He came to New York from Paducah,\r\nKentucky, rented a hall room, and sat down and wrote to the managing\r\neditor of the _Evening Sun_ a letter of application so humorous that\r\nhe was employed immediately. His report of the peace conference at\r\nPortsmouth, New Hampshire, following the Russo-Japanese War, attracted\r\nwide attention. Stephen French Whitman and Algernon Blackwood, the\r\nnovelists, were also _Evening Sun_ men.\r\n\r\nThe _Evening Sun’s_ list of former dramatic critics includes Acton\r\nDavies and Edward Fales Coward, both playwrights, and Charles\r\nB. Dillingham, the theatrical manager. Arthur Woods, recently\r\npolice commissioner of New York, and Robert Adamson, recently fire\r\ncommissioner, were old _Evening Sun_ men. Frederick Palmer, Associated\r\nPress correspondent with the British forces in the great war, and\r\nArthur Ruhl, a special correspondent at the front, are _Evening Sun_\r\nalumni.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the _Evening Sun_ the chief editorial writer was\r\nJames T. Watkins, whom Mr. Laffan had known in California as a man of\r\nwide scholarship and an economic expert. He was so prolific that it\r\nwas a common saying in the office that, with Watkins at his desk, the\r\n_Evening Sun_ needed no other writers of editorial articles. Frank H.\r\nSimonds, who had been an editorial writer for the _Sun_ since 1908,\r\nbecame chief editorial writer for the _Evening Sun_ in 1913. In 1914\r\nhis war articles attracted wide attention. He was afterward editor of\r\nthe _Tribune_.\r\n\r\nOther writers for the editorial page were Edward H. Mullin, an Irishman\r\nfrom Dublin, and Frederic J. Gregg. The chief editorial writer is now\r\nJames Luby, who is assisted by an _Evening Sun_ veteran, Winfield S.\r\nMoody.\r\n\r\nThe managing editors since W. C. McCloy have been Charles P. Cooper,\r\nJames Luby, and the present incumbent, George M. Smith, for many years\r\nnight editor of the _Sun_, and its managing editor in the absence of\r\nMr. Lord.\r\n\r\nAfter Allan Kelly, the city editors were W. C. McCloy, Charles P.\r\nCooper, Ervin Hawkins, Nelson Lloyd, and T. M. Dieuaide. Mr. Lloyd, who\r\nleft the paper to write fiction, had served as city editor from 1897 to\r\n1904.\r\n\r\nThe _Evening Sun_ has always had a particular appeal to the woman\r\nreader. Its first woman reporter, Miss Helen Watterson, of Cleveland,\r\nOhio, was induced to come East in Brisbane’s régime to write a column\r\ncalled “The Woman About Town,” and ever since 1890 the staff of women\r\nwriters on the paper has been increasing. The _Evening Sun_ has a page\r\nor two a day of feature articles written for women, by women, about\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nThe financial and sports departments of the _Evening Sun_ make it a\r\nman’s paper, too. No home-going broker would dare to board the subway\r\nwithout a copy of the Wall Street edition of the _Evening Sun_. A large\r\nstaff of sporting writers, captained by Joseph Vila, provides each day\r\na page or two of authoritative athletic news.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ and the _Evening Sun_ are run as separate publications, each\r\nwith a complete staff, but their presses and purposes are one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FINEST SIDE OF “THE SUN”\r\n\r\n  _Literary Associations of an Editorial Department That\r\n    Has Encouraged and Attracted Men of Imagination and\r\n    Talent.--Mitchell, Hazeltine, Church, and Their Colleagues._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ association with literature, particularly with fiction, has\r\nbeen more intimate than that of any other daily American newspaper. Ben\r\nDay had a taste for fiction, else the moon hoax, a bit of good writing\r\nas well as the greatest of fakes, would not have appeared. In the time\r\nof Moses Y. Beach the balloon hoax and other writings of Poe were in\r\nthe _Sun_. Moses S. Beach, who owned or controlled the paper for twenty\r\nyears, brought popularity and profit to it through stories written\r\nexclusively for the _Sun_ by Mary J. Holmes, Horatio Alger, Jr., and a\r\ndozen other authors whose tales compelled readers to burn the midnight\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nUnder Dana the _Sun’s_ interest in literature became broader, more\r\nintense. Dana’s knowledge that the most avid appetite of the public\r\nwas for the short story and the novel, led him to encourage his men\r\nto adopt, when feasible, the fiction form in news writing. In his\r\nfour-page daily there was not much room for romance proper, but when\r\nthe Sunday _Sun_ was under way, its eight pages afforded space for\r\ntales of fancy.\r\n\r\nIn the first few years of Dana’s ownership the walks of American\r\nliterature were not crowded. As late as 1875 the _Sun_ lamented:\r\n\r\n    For younger rising men we look almost in vain. Bret Harte gives\r\n    no promise of lasting fecundity. Howells does charming work,\r\n    and will probably long remain in position as a dainty but not\r\n    suggestive or formative writer. Aldrich is very slight. John\r\n    Hay easily won whatever name he has, and it will easily pass\r\n    away. Henry James the younger is one of the rising men, the\r\n    youth of literature.\r\n\r\n    But of all these there is not one who has yet discovered the\r\n    stuff out of which the kings and princes, or even the barons,\r\n    of literature are made.\r\n\r\nHarte, having written his most famous short stories, had come East.\r\nHowells, then thirty-eight, had published three or four novels, but\r\n“The Rise of Silas Lapham” was ten years ahead. John Hay, then on the\r\n_Tribune_ editorial staff, had written his “Pike County Ballads” and\r\n“Castilian Days.” Henry James had put forth only “Watch and Ward.” To\r\nthese budding geniuses the general public was rather inclined to prefer\r\nAugusta Evans’s “St. Elmo,” E. P. Roe’s “Barriers Burned Away,” and\r\nEdward Eggleston’s “Hoosier Schoolmaster.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the expressed doubt as to Harte’s fecundity, Dana\r\nadmired his work and printed his stories in the _Sun_ for years\r\nafterward. Late in the seventies he bought Harte’s output and\r\nsyndicated it--probably the first successful application of the\r\nnewspaper syndicate system to fiction. About the same period Robert\r\nLouis Stevenson’s earlier successes, such as “The Treasure of\r\nFranchard” and “The Sire de Maletroit’s Door,” were having their first\r\nAmerican printing in the _Sun_, their original appearance having been\r\nin _Temple Bar_ and other English magazines.\r\n\r\nThe files of the _Sun_ for 1891 contain writings of Stevenson that are\r\nomitted from most, if not from all of the collections of his works.\r\nThese are parts of his articles on the South Seas, an ambitious series\r\nwhich he was unable to finish. Some of them were printed in the\r\nLondon _Black and White_. All of them appeared in the _Sun_. Through\r\nthe _Sun’s_ literary syndicate the American public gained some of its\r\nearliest acquaintance with Harte and Henry James. Kipling’s “Light That\r\nFailed” had its first American appearance in the _Sun_ in the autumn\r\nof 1890. It may interest Mr. James’s admirers to know that one of the\r\nMiddle Western newspapers, having bought a James novel from the _Sun_,\r\nplayed it up with a gingery head-line:\r\n\r\n  GEORGINA’S REASONS!\r\n\r\n  HENRY JAMES’S LATEST STORY!\r\n\r\n  A Woman Who Commits Bigamy and Enforces Silence on\r\n  Her Husband!\r\n\r\n  Two Other Lives Made Miserable by Her Heartless Action!\r\n\r\nAmong the literary men given less to fiction and more to history,\r\nsociology, and philosophy who have yielded to the _Sun’s_ columns\r\nfrom their treasure, sometimes anonymously, were Jeremiah Curtin, the\r\ntranslator of Sienkiewicz and Tolstoy and an authority on folk-lore;\r\nGeorge Ticknor Curtis, jurist and writer on the Constitution; Goldwin\r\nSmith, whose views on the subject of the destiny of Canada coincided\r\nwith Dana’s, and who contributed to the _Sun_ hundreds of articles\r\nfrom his store of philosophical and political wisdom; Charles Francis\r\nAdams, Jr., who wrote on railway management; General Adam Badeau, one\r\nof Grant’s biographers; William Elliot Griffis, probably the most\r\nauthoritative of all American writers upon Japanese affairs; and\r\nFrancis Lynde Stetson, the distinguished authority on corporation and\r\nrailway law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    PAUL DANA\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf the more strictly journalistic writers who, although not attached\r\npermanently to the _Sun’s_ staff, contributed to its news and editorial\r\ncolumns, the names rise of James S. Pike, of Joseph Pulitzer and\r\nhis predecessor as editor of the _World_, William Henry Hurlbut; of\r\nJames F. Shunk and his brother-in-law, Chauncey F. Black, both of\r\nPennsylvania and both humorists; of Edward Spencer, a writer of fiction\r\nwho displayed splendid imaginative qualities, and of Oliver Dyer, whose\r\nrange of ability was so great that while one day he wrote for Bonner’s\r\n_Ledger_ advice to distressed lovers, the next day would find him\r\npenning for the _Sun_ an exhaustive article on the methods employed in\r\nbuilding a railroad across the Andes!\r\n\r\nDana encouraged the men who wrote exclusively, or almost entirely,\r\nfor the _Sun_, to write fiction. Edward P. Mitchell, whom Mr. Dana\r\nattracted to the _Sun_ from the Lewiston (Maine) _Journal_ in 1875,\r\nwhen Mr. Mitchell was twenty-three years old, wrote for the _Sun_\r\nat least a score of short stories of between two thousand and six\r\nthousand words. Two of his tales--“The Ablest Man in the World” and\r\n“The Tachypomp,” both scientific fantasies of remarkably ingenious\r\nconstruction, were included in the Scribner collection of “Short\r\nStories by American Authors,” Mr. Mitchell being the only writer doubly\r\nrepresented in those volumes. “The Ablest Man in the World” also\r\nhas its place in Stedman and Hutchinson’s distinguished “Library of\r\nAmerican Literature.”\r\n\r\nOther short stories of Mr. Mitchell’s, like “The Man Without a Body”\r\nand “The Balloon Tree,” are remembered by older _Sun_ readers for\r\ntheir ingenious form and delightful narrative. Mr. Mitchell’s smaller\r\nsketches, numbering perhaps three hundred, included not only fancy but\r\nhumour, and particularly little burlesques delicately picturing the\r\nweaknesses of the great or quasi-great men of the day. As a change\r\nfrom his strictly editorial work he might write a description of Mark\r\nTwain in his observatory, armed with a boat-hook and preparing to\r\nfend off a comet; or, becoming Mr. Dana’s reporter, he would expose a\r\nspiritualistic séance of the Eddy Brothers somewhere up in Vermont, or\r\ngo to Madison Square to record the progress of George Francis Train\r\ntoward world dictatorship by self-evolution on a diet of peanuts; or he\r\nwould write a dramatic criticism of the appearance of the _Sun’s_ droll\r\nfriend, George, the Count Joannes, as _Hamlet_.\r\n\r\nThese few instances, a dozen out of twenty thousand articles that Mr.\r\nMitchell wrote for the _Sun_, are not mentioned as a key to the general\r\ntenor of his work--which has covered everything from the definition\r\nof a mugwump to the interpretation of a President’s Constitutional\r\npowers--but rather as an indication of the _Sun’s_ catholicity in\r\nsubjects. If incidentally they serve to counteract the impression that\r\nthe editorship of a great newspaper is gained through mere erudition,\r\nas opposed to a fine understanding of the very human reader, so much\r\nthe better.\r\n\r\nFrom his first day with the _Sun_ Mr. Mitchell absorbed his chief’s\r\nlifelong belief that the range of public interest was infinite. As he\r\nsaid in 1916, in an address to the students of the Pulitzer School of\r\nJournalism on “The Newspaper Value of Non-Essentials”:\r\n\r\n    Sometimes people are as much interested in queer names, like\r\n    Poke Stogis, for example, or in the discussion of a question\r\n    such as “What Is the Best Ghost in Fiction?” or “How Should\r\n    Engaged Couples Act at the Circus?” or “What Is a Dodunk?”\r\n    or “Do the Angels Play Football?” as some other people are\r\n    interested in the conference of the great powers.\r\n\r\n    It is well to remember always this psychological factor.\r\n    Both the range of the newspaper and the attractive power of\r\n    the writer for the newspaper in any department depend upon\r\n    the breadth of sympathy with human affairs and the diversity\r\n    of things in which he, the writer, takes a genuine personal\r\n    interest.\r\n\r\nIn that speech the _Sun’s_ judgment of what the people want, whether\r\nit be in news, editorial, or fiction, is restated exactly as it might\r\nhave been stated at any time within the last fifty years. And Dana\r\nand Mitchell are found in agreement not only upon the subject of\r\nwhat the reader wishes, but upon the necessity for the preservation\r\nin newspapers, as well as in books, of the ideals of the language.\r\nSpeaking at a conference held at Princeton University in 1917, Mr.\r\nMitchell said:\r\n\r\n    The most serious practical evil that will result from the\r\n    elimination of the classics will fall upon the English\r\n    language itself. The racial memory begins to decay, the racial\r\n    imagination, the begetter of memory, begins to weaken, the\r\n    sense of precise meanings begins to lose its edge, and the\r\n    English language ceases to be a vital thing and becomes a mere\r\n    code of arbitrary signals wigwagged from mouth to ear. Were\r\n    I the emergency autocrat of this language, I should proclaim\r\n    in drastic regulations and enforce by severe penalties the\r\n    American duty of adherence to the old habits of speech, the old\r\n    scrupulous respect for the finer shades of meaning, the old\r\n    rigid observance of the morality of word relations; and this, I\r\n    believe, can be done only by maintaining the classical culture\r\n    at high potency.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitchell was born in Maine in 1852, and was graduated from Bowdoin\r\nin 1871. It is curious to note, scanning the names of the editors and\r\nproprietors, how the _Sun_ has drawn upon New England.\r\n\r\nBenjamin H. Day was born in West Springfield, Massachusetts, April 10,\r\n1810.\r\n\r\nMoses Yale Beach was born in Wallingford, Connecticut, January 7, 1800.\r\n\r\nMoses Sperry Beach was born in Springfield, Massachusetts, October 5,\r\n1822.\r\n\r\nCharles A. Dana was born in Hinsdale, New Hampshire, August 8, 1819.\r\n\r\nEdward P. Mitchell was born in Bath, Maine, March 24, 1852.\r\n\r\nFrank A. Munsey was born in Mercer, Maine, August 21, 1854.\r\n\r\nAny grouping of _Sun_ men on the purely literary side brings the name\r\nof Hazeltine to stand with those of Dana and Mitchell. Mayo Williamson\r\nHazeltine was a fine example of the scholar in newspaper work; an\r\nexample of the way in which Dana, with his intellectual magnificence,\r\nfound the best for his papers.\r\n\r\nEducated at Harvard and Oxford and in continental Europe, Hazeltine\r\ncame to the _Sun_ in 1878, and was its literary critic until his\r\ndeath in 1909. During the same period he was also one of its\r\nprincipal writers of articles on foreign politics and sociology.\r\nHis book-reviews, published in the _Sun_ on Sundays, which made the\r\ninitials “M. W. H.” familiar to the whole English-reading world, were\r\nmarvels of comprehension. Many a publisher of a three-volume historical\r\nwork lamented when it attracted Hazeltine’s attention, for his review,\r\nwhether two columns or seven, usually compressed into that space all\r\nthat the average student cared to know about the book, reducing the\r\nhigh cost of reading from six or eight dollars to a nickel.\r\n\r\nHazeltine enjoyed, under both Dana and Mitchell, practically his own\r\nchoice of subjects, a free hand with them, and a generous income; and\r\nin return, for more than thirty years, he poured into the columns\r\nof the _Sun_ a wealth of the erudition which was his by right of\r\neducation, travel, an intense interest in all things intellectual, and\r\na wonderful memory.\r\n\r\nIn the list of writers of editorial articles which includes Dana,\r\nMitchell, William O. Bartlett, and Hazeltine, are found also the names\r\nof Frank P. Church, E. M. Kingsbury, Napoleon L. Thiéblin, James Henry\r\nWilson, John Swinton, Henry B. Stanton, Fitz-Henry Warren, William T.\r\nWashburn, Harold M. Anderson, Frank H. Simonds, and Henry M. Armstrong.\r\nOf these Church stands alone as the writer in whose case the _Sun_\r\nbroke its rule that the anonymity of editorial writers is absolute.\r\nAfter Mr. Church’s death on April 11, 1906, it was announced in the\r\n_Sun_ that he was the author of what for more than twenty years has\r\nbeen regarded as the most popular editorial article ever written. It\r\nappeared on September 21, 1897:\r\n\r\n\r\n    IS THERE A SANTA CLAUS?\r\n\r\n    We take pleasure in answering at once and thus prominently the\r\n    communication below, expressing at the same time our great\r\n    gratification that its faithful author is numbered among the\r\n    friends of the _Sun_:\r\n\r\n    DEAR EDITOR:\r\n\r\n    I am eight years old. Some of my little friends say there is no\r\n    Santa Claus. Papa says “If you see it in the _Sun_ it’s so.”\r\n    Please tell me the truth, is there a Santa Claus?\r\n\r\n                                        VIRGINIA O’HANLON.\r\n\r\n    115 West Ninety-Fifth Street.\r\n\r\nVirginia, your little friends are wrong. They have been affected by the\r\nskepticism of a skeptical age. They do not believe except they see.\r\nThey think that nothing can be which is not comprehensible by their\r\nlittle minds. All minds, Virginia, whether they be men’s or children’s,\r\nare little. In this great universe of ours man is a mere insect, an\r\nant, in his intellect, as compared with the boundless world about him,\r\nas measured by the intelligence capable of grasping the whole of truth\r\nand knowledge.\r\n\r\nYes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love\r\nand generosity and devotion exist, and you know that they abound and\r\ngive to your life its highest beauty and joy. Alas, how dreary would\r\nbe the world if there were no Santa Claus! It would be as dreary as if\r\nthere were no Virginias. There would be no childlike faith then, no\r\npoetry, no romance, to make tolerable this existence. We should have\r\nno enjoyment except in sense and sight. The eternal light with which\r\nchildhood fills the world would be extinguished.\r\n\r\nNot believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies!\r\nYou might get your papa to hire men to watch in all the chimneys on\r\nChristmas Eve to catch Santa Claus, but even if they did not see Santa\r\nClaus coming down, what would that prove? Nobody sees Santa Claus, but\r\nthat is no sign that there is no Santa Claus. The most real things in\r\nthe world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever\r\nsee fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no proof\r\nthat they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders\r\nthere are unseen and unseeable in the world.\r\n\r\nYou tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise inside,\r\nbut there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest\r\nman, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever\r\nlived, could tear apart. Only faith, fancy, poetry, love, romance, can\r\npush aside that curtain and view and picture the supernal beauty and\r\nglory beyond. Is it all real? Ah, Virginia, in all this world there is\r\nnothing else real and abiding.\r\n\r\nNo Santa Claus! Thank God, he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand\r\nyears from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now,\r\nhe will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.\r\n\r\nChurch, as one intimate wrote upon his death, after more than thirty\r\nyears with the _Sun_, had all the literary gifts, “the tender fancy,\r\nthe sympathetic understanding of human nature, the humour, now wistful,\r\nnow joyous, the unsurpassed delicacy of touch.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM M. LAFFAN\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn dramatic criticism, where the _Sun_ has required from its writers\r\nsomewhat more than the mere ability to praise or blame, its roster\r\nbears such names as Frank Bowman, Willard Bartlett, Elihu Root, William\r\nStewart (“Walsingham”), who was the first of the dramatic critics to\r\nadopt an intimate style; Andrew Carpenter Wheeler, better known to\r\nthe public under his pen-name of “Nym Crinkle,” whose reviews were a\r\nfeature of the Sunday issue of the _Sun_; William M. Laffan, the always\r\nbrilliant and sometimes caustic; Franklin Fyles, who wrote plays as\r\nwell as reviews of plays; John Corbin, the scholarly analyst; Walter\r\nPrichard Eaton, author of “The American Stage of To-day,” and Lawrence\r\nReamer, who has been with the _Sun_, as reporter or critic, for a\r\nquarter of a century.\r\n\r\nIn criticism of opera and other musical events the _Sun_, through the\r\nwritings of William J. Henderson, has pleased the general public as\r\nwell as the musicians, and has added many sound and scholarly chapters\r\nto newspaper literature.\r\n\r\nIn book-reviewing a hundred pens have served the _Sun_. Hazeltine, E.\r\nP. Mitchell, Willard Bartlett, Erasmus D. Beach, George Bendelari, Miss\r\nDana Gatlin, H. M. Anderson, and Grant M. Overton are but a few of the\r\nmen and women who have told _Sun_ readers what’s worth while.\r\n\r\nFor _Sun_ reporters the Sunday paper has been a favourable field for\r\nan excursion into fiction-writing. In its columns a man with a tale\r\nto tell has every chance. There William Norr gave, in his “Pearl of\r\nChinatown,” the real atmosphere of a little part of New York that once\r\nheld romance. It was for the Sunday _Sun_ that Edward W. Townsend\r\ncreated his celebrated characters, _Chimmie Fadden_, _Miss Fanny_,\r\n_Mr. Paul_, and the rest of that happy, if slangy, family. Clarence\r\nL. Cullen laid bare the soul of alcoholic adventurers in his “Tales\r\nof the Ex-Tanks.” Ed Mott made famous the bears of Pike County,\r\nPennsylvania. David A. Curtis related the gambling ways of _Old Man\r\nGreenlaw_ and his associates. Charles Lynch conferred the title of the\r\nDuke of Essex Street upon an obscure lawyer, and made him the talk of\r\nthe East Side. Joseph Goodwin brought to the notice of an ignorant\r\nworld the ways of _Sarsaparilla Reilly_ and other Park Row restaurant\r\nheroes. David Graham Phillips, Samuel Hopkins Adams, and other men\r\ndestined to be known through their books, ground out, for glory and\r\neight dollars a column, the yarns--sometimes fact turned into fiction,\r\nsometimes fiction masked as fact--that kept the readers of the Sunday\r\n_Sun_ from getting out into the open air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n“THE SUN” AND YELLOW JOURNALISM\r\n\r\n  _The Coming and Going of a Newspaper Disease.--Dana’s Attitude\r\n    Toward President Cleveland.--Dana’s Death.--Ownerships of Paul\r\n    Dana, Laffan, Reich, and Munsey._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf such things as we have mentioned here, putting into the necessary\r\nnews, attractively written, a proper seasoning of regional colour and\r\natmosphere, humour and pathos, the _Sun_ has been made since Dana came\r\nto it. He created a new journalism, but it was a decent and distinct\r\nkind, appealing to the intellect rather than to the passions. It gave\r\nroom for the honest expression of everybody’s opinion, from Herbert\r\nSpencer to _Chimmie Fadden_. Because of this, because he had lifted\r\nAmerican newspaper work out of the dust of tradition, Dana had a holy\r\nanger when a newer journalism tried to throw it into the mud.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry Watterson was called as an expert witness in proceedings to\r\nappraise the estate of Joseph Pulitzer, in 1914, the veteran editor of\r\nthe Louisville _Courier-Journal_ made an interesting statement on this\r\nsubject:\r\n\r\n    There is much confusion in the public mind about what is known\r\n    as “yellow journalism.” There have been several periods of\r\n    it in New York. James Gordon Bennett was the first yellow\r\n    journalist, and Charles A. Dana was the second. Mr. Pulitzer\r\n    was the third. Finally, when Mr. Hearst came along, he was\r\n    the fourth, and I think he quite filled the field of yellow\r\n    journalism.\r\n\r\n    As Mr. Bennett became more respectable and Mr. Dana more fixed\r\n    in his efforts, they were raised in the public estimation. So\r\n    was Mr. Pulitzer. I think the field of yellow journalism is so\r\n    filled by the Hearst newspapers that they no more compete with\r\n    the _World_ than with the _Herald_ or the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nMr. Watterson did not define yellow journalism. Perhaps he considered\r\nit broadly as sensational journalism. The elder Bennett was sensational\r\nto the extent that he printed things which the sixpenny papers of his\r\ntime did not print. He made the interview popular, and he was the first\r\neditor to see the value of paying attention to financial news.\r\n\r\nSo far as printing human news is concerned, Benjamin H. Day worked that\r\nfield before Bennett started the _Herald_. If Mr. Watterson considered\r\nDana a yellow journalist, what else was Day, with his stories about the\r\nsodden things of the police-courts, or his description of Miss Susan\r\nAllen smoking a cigar and dancing in Broadway?\r\n\r\nPrinting a diagram of the scene of a murder, with a big black X to mark\r\nthe spot where the victim was found, did not make the _World_ a yellow\r\nnewspaper, for Amos Cummings began to print murder charts as soon as\r\nhe became managing editor of the _Sun_. Putting black-faced type over\r\na story on the front page did not make the _World_ or the _Journal_\r\nyellow, for Cummings, when he was on the _Tribune_, was the first to\r\nuse big type in head-lines, and the _Tribune_ was never accused of\r\nyellowness.\r\n\r\nIf pictures made a paper yellow, Dana was not yellow, for he used few\r\nillustrations in the news pages of the paper. Again, if head-lines\r\nindicate yellowness, Dana must be acquitted of being a yellow\r\njournalist; for the head-lines of the _Sun_, from the first year of\r\nDana’s control until after his death, remained practically unchanged,\r\nand were conservative to the last degree.\r\n\r\nHead-lines and pictures, so far as their sensational attraction was\r\nconcerned, meant nothing to Dana. He was not yellow, but white and\r\nalive. The distinction was clearly explained by Mr. Mitchell:\r\n\r\n    Remember the difference between white and yellow. The essential\r\n    difference is not of method or quality of product, but of\r\n    purpose and of moral responsibility or moral debasement.\r\n    Yellow will tell you that it means force, originality, and\r\n    independence in the presentation of ideas. This is consolatory\r\n    to yellow, but not accurate. Yellow will print an interesting\r\n    exaggeration or misstatement, knowing it to be such. If in\r\n    doubt about the truth of alleged news, but in no doubt whatever\r\n    as to its immediate value as a sensation, yellow will give the\r\n    benefit of the doubt to the sensation every time, and print it\r\n    with head-lines tall enough to reach to Saturn. White won’t;\r\n    that is the only real color test. I hope you are all going to\r\n    be white, and not only white, but red, white, and blue.\r\n\r\nNo yellow journalist he, Dana! To paraphrase Webster, he smote the\r\nrock of humanity, and abundant streams of literature rushed forth.\r\nIf he startled, he startled the intellect, not the eye. His appeals\r\nwere to the intelligence, the soul, the risibilities of man, and not\r\nto his primitive passions. He believed that all the information, the\r\nphilosophy, and the humour of the world could be conveyed through the\r\ntype of a daily newspaper as surely as and much more broadly than they\r\nhad been conveyed through the various mediums of the old newspapers,\r\nthe encyclopedias, the novels, the pulpit, and the lecture platform.\r\n\r\nWhen Dana attacked yellow journalism--the expressive phrase was\r\nfastened in the language by Ervin Wardman, in the _Press_--it was in\r\nthe firm belief that this new journalism, the “journalism that did\r\nthings,” was doing the wrong thing; that it was breaking down the\r\nmagnificent structure that had been reared by himself and Greeley and\r\nRaymond and Bennett and Hurlbut. This group had been possessed of\r\nall the newspaper faculties and facilities. If yellow journalism had\r\nbeen right, they would have raised it to its highest peak. Dana, who\r\nknew better than any editor of his time what the public wanted, could\r\nhave produced a perfect yellow _Sun_; but he chose to print a golden\r\none. He wrought more genuine journalistic advance than any other man\r\nin history. As Mr. Mitchell wrote of him in _McClure’s Magazine_ in\r\nOctober, 1894, three years before Mr. Dana’s death:\r\n\r\n    The revolution which his genius and invention have wrought in\r\n    the methods of practical journalism in America during the past\r\n    twenty-five years can be estimated only by newspaper-makers.\r\n    His mind, always original, and unblunted and unwearied at\r\n    seventy-five, has been a prolific source of new ideas in the\r\n    art of gathering, presenting, and discussing attractively the\r\n    news of the world.\r\n\r\n    He is a radical and unterrified innovator, caring not a copper\r\n    for tradition or precedent when a change of method promises a\r\n    real improvement. Restlessness like his, without his genius,\r\n    discrimination, and honesty of purpose, scatters and loses\r\n    itself in mere whimsicalities or pettinesses; or else it\r\n    deliberately degrades the newspaper upon which it is exercised.\r\n\r\n    To Mr. Dana’s personal invention are due many, if not most,\r\n    of the broad changes which within a quarter of a century have\r\n    transformed journalism in this country. From his individual\r\n    perception of the true philosophy of human interest, more\r\n    than from any other single source, have come the now general\r\n    repudiation of the old conventional standards of news\r\n    importance; the modern newspaper’s appreciation of the news\r\n    value of the sentiment and humor of the daily life around\r\n    us; the recognition of the principle that a small incident,\r\n    interesting in itself and well told, may be worth a column’s\r\n    space, when a large, dull fact is hardly worth a stickful’s;\r\n    the surprising extension of the daily newspaper’s province so\r\n    as to cover every department of general literature, and to take\r\n    in the world’s fancies and imaginings as well as its actual\r\n    events.\r\n\r\n    The word “news” has an entirely different significance from\r\n    what it possessed twenty-five or thirty years ago under the\r\n    ancient common law of journalism as derived from England;\r\n    and in the production of this immense change, greatly in\r\n    the interest of mankind and of the cheerfulness of daily\r\n    life, it would be difficult to exaggerate the direct and\r\n    indirect influence of Mr. Dana’s alert, scholarly, and widely\r\n    sympathetic perceptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM C. REICK\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe assaults which Dana made upon yellow journalism were not actuated\r\nby the jealous envy of one who has himself overlooked an opportunity.\r\nEverything that the _Sun_ attacked in yellow newspapers was something\r\nto which the _Sun_ itself never would have stooped--the faked or\r\ndistorted interview, the product of the thief or the eavesdropper,\r\nthe collection of back-stairs gossip, the pilfered photograph, the\r\nrevelation of personal affairs beyond the public’s business, the\r\narrogation of official authority, the maudlin plea for sympathy in a\r\nfactitious cause, the gross exaggeration for sensation’s sake of a\r\ntrifling occurrence, the appeal to sensualism, and the demagogic attack\r\nupon the rich.\r\n\r\nRight endures, and where is yellow journalism? Gone where the woodbine\r\ntwineth. Its prototype, the wild ass, stamps o’er its head and cannot\r\nbreak its sleep. The “journalism that does things” doesn’t do anything\r\nany more except to try and teach its men to write articles the way the\r\n_Sun_ has been printing them since 1868. In a chart of new journalism\r\nthe largest, blackest X-mark would show where the body of new\r\njournalism, slain by public taste, lies buried forever.\r\n\r\nThe New York _World_, once the most ingenious exponent of yellow\r\njournalism, has become as conservative as the _Sun_ was in the days\r\nwhen Joseph Pulitzer worked for Dana. Mr. Hearst’s papers, once the\r\ndeepest of all yellows, now hold up their hands in horror when they\r\nsee, beside them on the news-stands, the bold, black head-lines of the\r\n_Evening Post_!\r\n\r\nYellow journalism said to its readers:\r\n\r\n“This way to the big show! We have a mutilated corpse, a scandal\r\nin high life, divorce details that weren’t brought out in court, a\r\npersonal attack on the mayor, lifelike pictures of dead rats, the\r\nmemoirs of a demented dressmaker, some neatly invented prison horrors,\r\nand a general denunciation of everybody who owns more than five hundred\r\ndollars. Don’t miss it!”\r\n\r\nDana said to his readers:\r\n\r\n“Come, let me show you the clean stream of life; the newsboy with the\r\ntrained dog, the new painting at the Metropolitan Museum, an Arabian\r\nrestaurant on the East Side, the new Governor at Albany, the latest\r\ntheory of planetary control, one book by Old Sleuth and another by\r\nHenry James, a ghost in a Berkshire tavern and an authentic recipe\r\nfor strawberry shortcake, a clown who reads Molière and a king who\r\nplays pinochle, a digest of ten volumes of history and the shortest\r\ncomplete poem (“This bliz knocks biz”) ever written, a dark tragedy in\r\nthe Jersey pines and a plan for a new subway, a talk with the Grand\r\nLama and a home-run by Roger Connor, a panic in Wall Street and a poor\r\nlittle girl who finds a quarter.”\r\n\r\nIn the long run--and it did not have to be very long--the more\r\nattractive offering was permanently chosen by newspaper-readers.\r\n\r\nThe curious effect on American journalism of the conflict between _Sun_\r\nmethods and the so-called new journalism was referred to, in an address\r\ndelivered at Yale University on January 12, 1903, by Frank A. Munsey,\r\nthen owner of the New York _Daily News_ and now proprietor of the _Sun_:\r\n\r\n    The newspaperman of to-day is a composite type, the product\r\n    of the _Sun_ and the New York _World_ of fifteen or eighteen\r\n    years ago. These two newspapers represented two distinct and\r\n    widely different styles of journalism. The _World_ was alert,\r\n    daring, aggressive, and sensational. It was about the liveliest\r\n    thing that ever swung into New York from the West.... No man\r\n    has ever stamped himself more thoroughly upon his generation\r\n    than has Joseph Pulitzer on the journalism of America. He was\r\n    the originator and the founder of our present type of overgrown\r\n    newspaper, with its illustrations and its merits and its\r\n    defects.\r\n\r\n    The part the _Sun_ played in this recreating and rejuvenating\r\n    of the American press was purely literary. It was the first\r\n    newspaper to make fiction out of facts--that is, to handle\r\n    facts with the skill and manner of the novelist, so that they\r\n    read like fiction and possessed all its charm and fascination.\r\n    The _Sun_ at that time consisted of but four pages, and I am\r\n    convinced that it was the best example of newspaper-making ever\r\n    produced anywhere. With the exception of one or two of these\r\n    fiction-fact stories so charmingly told, it was the perfection\r\n    of condensation, accuracy, brilliancy.\r\n\r\nMr. Munsey did not say, because it was not germane to his subject,\r\nthat for fourteen years before the advent of Pulitzer, Dana had been\r\ndemonstrating the news value of the human-interest story, and that\r\nit was almost entirely upon the human-interest story, twisted and\r\nexaggerated, that yellow journalism was founded. Mr. Munsey did not\r\nsay, for he could not know, that fifteen years after his address at\r\nYale the new journalism would be extinct and the _Sun_ would be still\r\nthe _Sun_. The editors of to-day do not ask a reporter whether he can\r\nclimb a porch or photograph an unwilling person, but whether he can see\r\nnews and write it.\r\n\r\nAn adequate history of the _Sun’s_ political activities during Dana’s\r\ntime would fill volumes. Rather than the editor of an organ of the\r\nopposition, Dana was usually an opposition party in himself; not merely\r\nfor the sake of opposition, but because the parties in power from 1869\r\nto 1897 usually happened to have practices or principles with which\r\nhe, as the editor of the _Sun_, was in disagreement. His attacks on\r\nthe Grant administration for the thievery that spotted it, and on the\r\nHayes administration because of the circumstances under which Mr. Hayes\r\ncame to the Presidential chair, were bitter and without relent. His\r\nopposition to Grover Cleveland, an intellectual rather than a personal\r\nwar, began before Mr. Cleveland was a national figure. In September,\r\n1882, when the hitherto obscure Buffalonian was nominated for Governor\r\nof New York, the _Sun_ said:\r\n\r\n    It is usually not a wise thing in politics, any more than in\r\n    war, to take a private from the ranks and at one bound to\r\n    promote him to be commander-in-chief; yet that is what has been\r\n    done in the case of Grover Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIn the Presidential campaign of 1884 the _Sun_ would not support\r\nCleveland and could not support Blaine, whose conduct in Congress\r\nthe _Sun_ had frequently condemned; so it advocated the hopeless\r\ncause of General Benjamin F. Butler, who had been elected Governor of\r\nMassachusetts in 1882, the year when Cleveland was chosen Governor of\r\nNew York. Dana was not an admirer of Butler’s spectacular army career,\r\nor of his general political leanings, but he admired him for his\r\nattitude in the Hayes-Tilden scandal, and he believed that Butler,\r\nif elected President, would shake things up in Washington. The _Sun_\r\nsupported him “as a man to be immensely preferred to either of the\r\nothers and as a protest against such nominations.” Dana personally\r\nannounced that sooner than support Blaine he would quit work and burn\r\nhis pen.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, opposing Cleveland’s free-trade policy, the _Sun_ vigorously\r\nsupported Samuel J. Randall, of Pennsylvania, a protectionist Democrat,\r\nfor speaker of the House, as against John G. Carlisle, of Kentucky, a\r\nfree-trader; but Randall was beaten.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ ridiculed Cleveland’s theories of civil-service reform,\r\nalthough it believed that real reforms were needed. On this point Dana\r\nwrote, in a letter:\r\n\r\n    I do not believe in the establishment in this country of\r\n    the German bureaucratic system, with its permanent staff of\r\n    office-holders who are not responsible to the people, and whose\r\n    tenure of place knows no variation and no end except the end of\r\n    life. In my judgment a genuine reform of the evils complained\r\n    of is reached by the vigorous simplification of the machinery\r\n    of government, by the repeal of all superfluous laws, the\r\n    abolition of every needless office, and the dismissal of every\r\n    needless officer. The true American doctrine on this subject\r\n    consists in the diminution of government, not in its increase.\r\n\r\nFor all of its opposition to Cleveland, whom it dubbed the “stuffed\r\nprophet,” the _Sun_ preferred him to General Harrison in the campaign\r\nof 1888. It feared a return to power of the influences which it had\r\ncombated during the administrations of Grant and Hayes. Four years\r\nafterward, however, the _Sun_ was strongly against the third nomination\r\nof Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Cleveland’s second term the _Sun_ supported his course when Dana\r\nbelieved it to be American. While at first it considered the President\r\ntoo mild and conciliatory in matters of foreign policy, it praised him\r\nand his Secretary of State, Richard Olney, for their stand against\r\nGreat Britain in the Venezuela boundary dispute; praised them just as\r\nheartily as it had condemned Mr. Cleveland’s earlier action in the\r\nHawaiian matter, when the President withdrew the treaty of annexation\r\nwhich his predecessor had sent to the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun’s_ most deadly weapon, ridicule, was constantly in play in\r\nthe years of the Hawaiian complications. It found vulnerable spots in\r\nMr. Cleveland’s re-establishment of the deposed Queen Liliuokalani and\r\nin the President’s sending of a commissioner--“Paramount” Blount, as\r\nthe _Sun_ called him--without the advice and consent of the Senate.\r\nAs jealous then as it is to-day of any raid by the Executive upon the\r\nConstitution or the powers of Congress, the _Sun_ had the satisfaction\r\nof a complete victory in the Hawaiian matter.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the _Sun_ applauded Mr. Cleveland’s attitude on\r\nthe money question and his brave stand against the mob in the Chicago\r\nrailway strikes of 1894, when the President used troops to prevent the\r\nobstruction of the mails by Eugene V. Debs and his followers.\r\n\r\nDana was seventy-seven years old when William J. Bryan--whom the _Sun_\r\nhad already immortalized as the Boy Orator of the Platte--was nominated\r\nfor the Presidency in 1896, but the veteran editor went at the task of\r\nexposing the free-silver fallacy with the same blithe vigour that he\r\nhad shown twenty years before. His opinion, printed in the _Sun_ of\r\nAugust 6, 1896, is a good example of Dana’s clear style:\r\n\r\n    The Chicago platform invites us to establish a currency which\r\n    will enable a man to pay his debts with half as much\r\n    property as he would have to use in order to pay them now. This\r\n    proposition is dishonest. I do not say that all the advocates\r\n    of the free coinage of silver are dishonest. Thousands of\r\n    them--millions, if there be so many--are doubtless honest in\r\n    intention. But I am unable to reconcile with any ideal of\r\n    integrity a change in the law which will permit a man who has\r\n    borrowed a hundred dollars to pay his debt with a hundred\r\n    dollars each one of which is worth only half as much as each\r\n    dollar he received from the lender.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    FRANK A. MUNSEY\r\n]\r\n\r\nDana’s opinions on political questions were more eagerly sought than\r\nthose of any other editor after Greeley’s death, and the _Sun’s_\r\npolitical news was complete; yet with Dana, and with the _Sun_,\r\npolitics was, after all, only one small part of life. The whole\r\nworld, with its facts and fancies, not the political problems of one\r\ncontinent, was the real field to be covered.\r\n\r\nDana’s curiosity was all-embracing. After the _Sun’s_ financial success\r\nwas assured he went abroad frequently, and saw not only western Europe,\r\nbut Russia and the Levant. Of these he wrote in his “Eastern Journeys.”\r\nHe knew a dozen languages. He conversed with the Pope about Dante and\r\nwith Russian peasants about Tolstoy. His knowledge of Spanish, acquired\r\nearly in life, made easy his travels in Mexico and Cuba. Everywhere he\r\nwent he talked of freedom with its friends, and encouraged them. He\r\nknew Kossuth, Mazzini, Garibaldi, Clémenceau, Marti, and Parnell.\r\n\r\nAt home, Dana’s amusements were chiefly literary and artistic--the\r\nstudy of languages, history, and _belles-lettres_, the collection of\r\npottery and pictures. His Chinese porcelains were perhaps the best, in\r\npoint of quality, in the Occident.\r\n\r\n“I am persuaded,” one critic said of them, “that Mr. Dana must have had\r\na most profound instinct in relation to the whole subject.”\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Dana’s death these porcelains, about four hundred in number,\r\nwere sold at auction for nearly two hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn winter Dana lived in a large house which he built in 1880 at the\r\ncorner of Madison Avenue and Sixtieth Street, and which held the art\r\ntreasures that he began to gather in the first days of his prosperity.\r\nHere he kept his pictures, notably some fine specimens of the Barbizon\r\nschool, and his books, which included some rare volumes, but which in\r\nthe main were chosen for their usefulness.\r\n\r\nDana’s happiest days were spent at his country place, Dosoris, an\r\nisland near Glen Cove, on the north shore of Long Island. There,\r\naround a large, old-fashioned, square frame house, he made roads and\r\nflower-beds and planted trees from many parts of the world. He grew an\r\noak from an acorn that was brought from the tomb of Confucius. He knew\r\nGray’s “Botany” almost by heart, and could give an intimate description\r\nof every flower in the Dosoris gardens. His interest in plants was so\r\ndeep that once, while travelling in Cuba with an eminent painter, he\r\nled his companion for hours through the hot hills of Vuelta Abajo in\r\norder to satisfy himself that a certain variety of pine did _not_ grow\r\nin that region.\r\n\r\nDana’s was a normal, healthy life. He was a good horseman and swimmer\r\nand a great walker. When he was seventy-five years old he climbed to\r\nthe top of Croyden Mountain, in New Hampshire, with a party of younger\r\nmen puffing behind him. He found pleasure in all of life, whether it\r\nwas at the office, where he worked steadily but not feverishly, or\r\nwith his family among the rural delights of Dosoris, or surrounded by\r\ncongenial literary spirits at the dinner-table.\r\n\r\nHe knew no illness until his last summer. Up to June, 1897, the sturdy\r\nfigure and the kindly face framed in a white beard were as familiar to\r\nthe _Sun_ office as they were in the seventies. With Dana there was no\r\nslow decay of body or mind. He died at Dosoris on October 17, 1897, in\r\nthe thirtieth year of his reign over the _Sun_.\r\n\r\nA few years before, on observing an obituary paragraph which Mr. Dana\r\nhad written about some noted man, John Swinton asked his chief how much\r\nspace he (Swinton) would get when his time came.\r\n\r\n“For you, John, two sticks,” said Mr. Dana. Turning to Mr. Mitchell,\r\nthen his chief editorial writer, he added: “For me, two lines.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning after Mr. Dana’s death every newspaper but one in\r\nNew York printed columns about the career of the dean of American\r\njournalism. The _Sun_ printed only ten words, and these were carried at\r\nthe head of the first editorial column, without a heading:\r\n\r\n    CHARLES ANDERSON DANA, editor of the _Sun_, died yesterday\r\n    afternoon.\r\n\r\nMr. Swinton perhaps believed that Mr. Dana was joking when he said “two\r\nlines,” but Mr. Mitchell knew that his chief was in earnest. The order\r\nwas characteristic of Dana. It was not false modesty. Perhaps it was a\r\ncertain fine vanity that told him what was true--that he and his work\r\nwere known throughout the land; that the _Sun_, in its perfection the\r\nproduct of his genius and vigour, would continue to rise as regularly\r\nas its celestial namesake; that all he had done would live on. He had\r\nmade the paper so great that the withdrawal from it of one man’s hand\r\nwas negligible.\r\n\r\nDana was gone, but his son remained as principal owner, and his chief\r\nwriter and most intimate intellectual associate for twenty years was\r\nleft to form the _Sun’s_ policies as he had moulded them in Dana’s\r\nabsences and as he shapes them to-day. His publisher, the astute\r\nLaffan, was still in charge of the _Sun’s_ financial affairs. Other men\r\nwhom he had found and trained, like Frank P. Church, Mayo W. Hazeltine,\r\nand Edward M. Kingsbury in the editorial department, and Chester S.\r\nLord and Daniel F. Kellogg in the news department, continued their work\r\nas if Dana still lived.\r\n\r\nWith their grief doubt was not mingled. The _Sun’s_ success resulted\r\nfrom no secret formula that died with the discoverer. Half of Dana’s\r\nvictory came by his attraction to himself of men who saw life and\r\nliterature as he saw them; and so, in a magnificent way, he had made\r\nhis work dispensable.\r\n\r\nAnd Dana’s was always the magnificent way. To him journalism was not a\r\nmeans of making money, but of interesting, elevating, and making happy\r\nevery one who read the _Sun_ or wrote for it. He raised his profession\r\nto new heights. As Hazeltine wrote in the _North American Review_:\r\n\r\n    One of Mr. Dana’s special titles to the remembrance of his\r\n    fellow workers in the newspaper calling is the fact that,\r\n    more than any other man on either side of the Atlantic, he\r\n    raised their vocation to a level with the legal and medical\r\n    professions as regards the scale of remuneration. He honored\r\n    his fellow craftsmen of the pen, and he compelled the world to\r\n    honor them.\r\n\r\nShortly after the death of his father, Paul Dana, who was then\r\nforty-five years old, and who had been on the _Sun_ editorial staff for\r\nseventeen years, was made editor by vote of the trustees of the Sun\r\nPrinting and Publishing Association. In the following year (1898) the\r\nyounger Dana bought from Thomas Hitchcock, who was one of Charles A.\r\nDana’s associates both in a financial and in a literary way, enough\r\nshares to give him the control of the paper.\r\n\r\nPaul Dana continued in control of the property for several years and\r\nheld with credit his father’s title of editor until 1903. William\r\nMackay Laffan, who had been associated with the elder Dana since 1877,\r\nnext obtained the business control. His proprietorship was announced on\r\nFebruary 22, 1902, and it continued until his death in 1909.[A]\r\n\r\n    [A] The following editorial article appeared in the _Sun_ on\r\n        July 26, 1918:\r\n\r\n        “Mr. Paul Dana calls the _Sun’s_ attention to what he\r\n        claims was an error in ‘The Story of the _Sun_’ as it\r\n        originally appeared in the _Munsey Magazine_: the statement\r\n        that ‘he [Mr. Dana] continued in control of the property\r\n        until 1900.’ Mr. Dana states that he did not dispose of\r\n        his controlling interest until 1902. The statement in the\r\n        _Munsey Magazine_ publication of ‘The Story of the _Sun_’\r\n        was founded upon the International Encyclopædia’s biography\r\n        of William M. Laffan and also upon a statement published in\r\n        the _Sun_ at the time of Mr. Laffan’s death in 1909, that\r\n        Mr. Laffan obtained the control of the _Sun_ in 1900. When\r\n        the _Munsey Magazine_ articles were reprinted in the Sunday\r\n        _Sun_ the paragraph referred to by Mr. Dana was changed to\r\n        read as follows:\r\n\r\n        “‘Paul Dana continued in control of the property for\r\n        several years and held with credit his father’s title of\r\n        editor until 1903. William Mackay Laffan, who had been\r\n        associated with the elder Dana since 1877, obtained the\r\n        business control. His proprietorship was announced on\r\n        February 22, 1902, and it continued until his death in\r\n        1909.’\r\n\r\n        “We will let Mr. Dana’s version of this matter stand in\r\n        ‘The Story of the _Sun_’ unless some further evidence\r\n        appears on the disputed point.”\r\n\r\nAmong the makers of the _Sun_ who best knew the paper and the\r\nintellectual demands of its readers, Laffan must be included with Dana\r\nand Mitchell. At the time when he came to be master of the paper, his\r\ncareer had covered the entire journalistic field, and he was, moreover,\r\na thorough _Sun_ man, sympathetic with all the ideals of his old friend\r\nDana.\r\n\r\nLaffan, who was born in Dublin, Ireland, and had a light and delightful\r\nbrogue, was educated at Trinity College and at St. Cecilia’s School\r\nof Medicine. When he was twenty he went to San Francisco, where,\r\nbeginning as a reporter, he became city editor of the _Chronicle_ and\r\nmanaging editor of the _Bulletin_. In 1870 he went to Baltimore, to\r\nbe a reporter on the _Daily Bulletin_, and of this newspaper he became\r\neditor and part owner. Eventually he became the full owner of both\r\nthe _Daily Bulletin_ and the _Sunday Bulletin_, and in this capacity\r\nhe endeared himself to the citizens of Baltimore by his fight against\r\npolitical rings.\r\n\r\nHe left newspaper work for a short time to become general\r\npassenger-agent of the Long Island Railroad; but in 1877, on Mr. Dana’s\r\ninvitation, he went on the _Sun_ as a general writer. Himself an artist\r\nwho modelled in clay, painted in oils and water-colours, and etched,\r\nhis judgment made him valuable to the paper as an art critic.\r\n\r\nLike Mr. Dana, he was interested in Chinese porcelains, and he made a\r\ndeeper study of them than did his employer. When a catalogue was needed\r\nfor the Chinese porcelains in the Morgan collection in the Metropolitan\r\nMuseum of Art, Mr. Laffan, who was an active trustee of the museum,\r\nwas called upon to edit the work. He also edited a book on “Oriental\r\nPorcelain.” He was the author of “American Wood Engravers,” published\r\nin 1883. For these things he is remembered in the world of art. The men\r\nof the stage remember him as one of the most distinguished dramatic\r\ncritics that New York has seen. Even to-day, in the comparison of the\r\nstyles of critics old and new, Laffan’s incisive reviews are recalled\r\nas standards.\r\n\r\nIn the business world of journalism Laffan is thought of chiefly as\r\nthe publisher of the _Sun_ from 1884 on, and as the live spirit of the\r\n_Evening Sun_ for many of its years. As the actual director of the\r\n_Sun_--although his editorial powers were almost entirely delegated to\r\nMr. Mitchell--Mr. Laffan was a picturesque and powerful figure. Beneath\r\nan inscrutable exterior he was distinctly a likable person.\r\n\r\nOne day Laffan wrote a ten-line item, a bit about an exhibition of a\r\nfriend’s painting, and asked the city editor to print it. He never\r\ncommanded, even when he controlled the paper; he asked. The item was\r\nlost in the shuffle that night. The next day he rewrote it and again\r\nasked a place for it. It was printed in the first edition and left out\r\nof the city edition. For the third time he carried the article to the\r\ncity editor, and without a sign of anger.\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” he said, “that anybody can get anything printed in\r\nthis paper--except the owner.”\r\n\r\nA millionaire advertiser asked Laffan to print an article about his pet\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\n“Take it to Clarke,” said Laffan. “If he’ll print it for you, he’ll do\r\nmore for you than he’ll do for me.”\r\n\r\nA New York newspaper once remarked of Laffan that “he never drove any\r\nman to drink, but he drove many a man to the dictionary.” That was a\r\ncommentary on the unusual words which Laffan, whose vocabulary was\r\nwide, would occasionally use in an editorial article. His articles were\r\nnever involved, however. They were not frequent, they were generally\r\nshort, never without important purpose, and they drove home.\r\n\r\nPatient as Laffan was with lost items of his own, he was a man of fine\r\nhuman temper. One morning, on arriving at the office, he found that a\r\nWall Street group of rich scoundrels had sued the _Sun_ for several\r\nhundred thousand dollars for its exposure of their methods. He called\r\nthe city editor.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Mallon,” he said, “tell your young man who wrote the articles to\r\ngo ahead and give these men better cause for libel suits!”\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ was making a vigorous war on a great railroad magnate. One\r\nday an attaché of the office informed Laffan that a man was waiting\r\nto see him who bore a contract which would bring to the _Sun_ four\r\nhundred thousand dollars’ worth of advertising from the magnate’s\r\nrailroads.\r\n\r\n“Tell him to see the advertising manager,” said Laffan.\r\n\r\n“He insists on seeing you,” said the clerk.\r\n\r\n“Tell him to go to hell,” said Laffan.\r\n\r\nThere was a keen humour in the big Irish head. Laffan was opposed to\r\nthe amendment to the New York State constitution which provided for\r\nan expenditure of more than a hundred millions in improving the Erie\r\nCanal. Under his direction a _Sun_ reporter, John H. O’Brien, wrote\r\na series of articles intended to shatter public faith in the huge\r\ninvestment. The amendment, however, was approved by a great majority.\r\n\r\n“Mr. O’Brien,” said Mr. Laffan to the reporter, a few days after the\r\nelection, “I think it would be a very graceful thing on your part to\r\ngive a little dinner to all those gentlemen who voted against the canal\r\nproject.”\r\n\r\nUpon Mr. Laffan’s death, in November, 1909, the trustees of the\r\nSun Printing and Publishing Association asked Mr. Mitchell, who\r\nhad been made editor of the _Sun_ on July 20, 1903, to take up the\r\nadministrative burden as well as the editorial. This Mr. Mitchell did\r\nfor a little more than two years, although his personal inclinations\r\nwere toward the literary construction and supervision of the paper\r\nrather than toward the business detail incident to the presidency of so\r\nlarge a corporation. The double load was lightened in December, 1911,\r\nwhen control of the _Sun_ was gained through stock purchase by William\r\nC. Reick, who became the president of the company, Mr. Mitchell being\r\npermitted to return to the editorial functions which have now engrossed\r\nhim, either as Mr. Dana’s aid or as editor-in-chief, for more than\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EDWARD PAGE MITCHELL\r\n    Editor of “The Sun”\r\n]\r\n\r\nMr. Reick, who was born in Philadelphia in 1864, entered newspaper\r\nwork in that city when he was nineteen years old. A few years later he\r\nremoved to Newark, New Jersey, where he became the correspondent of\r\nthe New York _Herald_. He attracted the attention of Mr. Bennett, the\r\nowner of the _Herald_, and in 1888 he was made editor of the _Herald’s_\r\nLondon and Paris editions. A year later he returned to America to\r\nbecome city editor of the _Herald_, the highest title then given on a\r\nnewspaper which refuses to have a titular managing editor. In 1903 he\r\nwas elected president of the New York Herald Company, and he remained\r\nin that position until 1906, when he left the _Herald_ to become\r\nassociated with Adolph Ochs in the publication of the New York _Times_\r\nand with George W. Ochs in the publication of the Philadelphia _Public\r\nLedger_.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Reick assumed the control of the _Sun_ properties, he devoted\r\nmuch care to the improvement of the _Evening Sun_, putting it under the\r\nmanaging editorship of George M. Smith, who had served for many years\r\nas news editor of the _Sun_ under Chester S. Lord. As Mr. Munsey said\r\nwhen he acquired the _Sun_ and the _Evening Sun_ from Mr. Reick:\r\n\r\n    Very great credit is due Mr. Reick for the fine development of\r\n    the _Evening Sun_ since it came under his control. I know of no\r\n    man who has done a better and sounder piece of newspaper work\r\n    at any time, in New York or elsewhere, than Mr. Reick has done\r\n    on the _Evening Sun_.\r\n\r\nAmong the events of the Reick régime were the retirement of Chester\r\nS. Lord from the managing editorship and of George B. Mallon from the\r\ncity editorship, and the removal of the newspaper from its old home at\r\nNassau and Frankfort Streets to the American Tract Society Building,\r\none block farther south, at Nassau and Spruce Streets.\r\n\r\nIt was during Mr. Reick’s control of the _Sun_ that Mr. Munsey, in the\r\nautumn of 1912, bought the New York _Press_, a one-cent Republican\r\nmorning daily holding an Associated Press membership. The _Sun_ had\r\nlacked the Associated Press service since the fateful night when Mr.\r\nDana bolted from that organization and started the Laffan News Bureau.\r\n\r\nMr. Munsey bought the _Sun_ from Mr. Reick on June 30, 1916, and four\r\ndays later, on July 3, the _Press_, with its Associated Press service,\r\nits best men, and some of its popular features, was absorbed by the\r\n_Sun_. As the _Press_ had been a penny paper, the price of the _Sun_\r\nwas reduced to one cent, after having stood at two cents since the\r\nCivil War. It remained a penny paper until January 26, 1918, when the\r\npressure of production-costs forced the price of all the big New York\r\ndailies to two cents.\r\n\r\nThe amalgamation of the _Sun_ and the _Press_ wrought no change in the\r\neditorial department of the _Sun_, Mr. Mitchell remaining as its chief.\r\nErvin Wardman, long the editor of the _Press_, became the publisher\r\nof the Sun and vice-president of the Sun Printing and Publishing\r\nAssociation. Mr. Reick remained with the organization in an advisory\r\ncapacity. Keats Speed, the managing editor of the _Press_, became\r\nmanaging editor of the _Sun_, Kenneth Lord remaining as city editor.\r\n\r\nThe _Sun_ has had five homes--at 222 William Street, where Benjamin H.\r\nDay struck off the first tiny number; at 156 Nassau Street, rented by\r\nDay in August, 1835, when the paper began to pay well; at the southwest\r\ncorner of Nassau and Fulton Streets, to which Moses Y. Beach moved\r\nthe _Sun_ in 1842; at Nassau and Frankfort Streets, the old Tammany\r\nHall, which Dana and his associates bought; and at 150 Nassau Street,\r\nwhither the _Sun_ moved in July, 1915. It is expected that the _Sun_\r\nwill presently move to another and a fine home, for in September,\r\n1917, Mr. Munsey bought the Stewart Building, at the northeast corner\r\nof Broadway and Chambers Street, just north of City Hall Park. The\r\nsite is generally admitted to be the most desirable building site\r\ndowntown, so large is the ground space, so fine is the outlook over\r\nthe spacious park, and so close is it to three subways, three or four\r\nelevated-railroad lines, and the Brooklyn Bridge.\r\n\r\nShould the criticism be made that this book is not all-inclusive,\r\nlet it be remembered that there can be no really complete history of\r\nthe _Sun_ except itself--the tons of files in which for eighty-five\r\nyears _Sun_ men have drawn their pictures of life’s procession. In a\r\nnarrative like this only the outlines of the _Sun’s_ course, margined\r\nwith incidents of the men who made it great by making it as human as\r\nthemselves, can find room.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to begin a story of the _Sun_, because Ben Day and that\r\nuncertain morning in 1833, the very dawn of popular journalism, make a\r\nvery real picture. Try to end it, and the roar of the presses in the\r\nbasement is remindful of the fact that there is no end, except the\r\narbitrary closing. This _Sun_, like _Richmond’s_--\r\n\r\n  By the bright track of his fiery car\r\n  Gives token of a goodly day to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe files of the _Sun_, 1833–1918.\r\n\r\n“The Life of Charles A.
