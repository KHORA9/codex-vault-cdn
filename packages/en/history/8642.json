Fuller.\r\n\r\nWith an introduction by Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt has been thought desirable that such papers of Margaret Fuller\r\nOssoli as pertained to the condition, sphere and duties of Woman,\r\nshould be collected and published together. The present volume\r\ncontains, not only her \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century,\"--which has\r\nbeen before published, but for some years out of print, and\r\ninaccessible to readers who have sought it,--but also several other\r\npapers, which have appeared at various times in the _Tribune_ and\r\nelsewhere, and yet more which have never till now been published.\r\n\r\nMy free access to her private manuscripts has given to me many papers,\r\nrelating to Woman, never intended for publication, which yet seem\r\nneedful to this volume, in order to present a complete and harmonious\r\nview of her thoughts on this important theme. I have preferred to\r\npublish them without alteration, as most just to her views and to the\r\nreader; though, doubtless, she would have varied their expression and\r\nform before giving them to the press.\r\n\r\nIt seems right here to remark, In order to avoid any misapprehension,\r\nthat Margaret Ossoli's thoughts wore not directed so exclusively to\r\nthe subject of the present volume as have been the minds of some\r\nothers. As to the movement for the emancipation of Woman from the\r\nunjust burdens and disabilities to which she has been subject oven in\r\nour own land, my sister could neither remain indifferent nor silent;\r\nyet she preferred, as in respect to every other reform, to act\r\nindependently and to speak independently from her own stand-point, and\r\nnever to merge her individuality in any existing organization. This\r\nshe did, not as condemning such organizations, nor yet as judging them\r\nwholly unwise or uncalled for, but because she believed she could\r\nherself accomplish more for their true and high objects, unfettered by\r\nsuch organizations, than if a member of them. The opinions avowed\r\nthroughout this volume, and wherever expressed, will, then, be found,\r\nwhether consonant with the reader's or no, in all cases honestly and\r\nheartily her own,--the result of her own thought and faith. She never\r\nspeaks, never did speak, for any clique or sect, but as her individual\r\njudgment, her reason and conscience, her observation and experience,\r\ntaught her to speak.\r\n\r\nI could have wished that some one other than a brother should have\r\nspoken a few fitting words of Margaret Fuller, as a woman, to form a\r\nbrief but proper accompaniment to this volume, which may reach some\r\nwho have never read her \"Memoirs,\" recently published, or have never\r\nknown her in personal life. This seemed the more desirable, because\r\nthe strictest verity in speaking of her must seem, to such as knew her\r\nnot, to be eulogy. But, after several disappointments as to the\r\neditorship of the volume, the duty, at last, has seemed to devolve\r\nupon me; and I have no reason to shrink from it but a sense of\r\ninadequacy.\r\n\r\nIt is often supposed that literary women, and those who are active and\r\nearnest in promoting great intellectual, philanthropic, or religious\r\nmovements, must of necessity neglect the domestic concerns of life. It\r\nmay be that this is sometimes so, nor can such neglect be too severely\r\nreprehended; yet this is by no means a necessary result. Some of the\r\nmost devoted mothers the world has ever known, and whose homes were\r\nthe abode of every domestic virtue, themselves the embodiment of all\r\nthese, have been women whose minds were highly cultured, who loved and\r\ndevoted both thought and time to literature, and were active in\r\nphilanthropic and diffusive efforts for the welfare of the race.\r\n\r\nThe letter to M., which is published on page 345, is inserted chiefly\r\nas showing the integrity and wisdom with which Margaret advised her\r\nfriends; the frankness with which she pointed out to every young woman\r\nwho asked counsel any deficiencies of character, and the duties of\r\nlife; and that among these latter she gave due place to the humblest\r\nwhich serve to make home attractive and happy. It is but simple\r\njustice for me to bear, in conjunction with many others, my tribute to\r\nher domestic virtues and fidelity to all home duties. That her mind\r\nfound chief delight in the lowest forms of these duties may not be\r\ntrue, and it would be sad if it were; but it is strictly true that\r\nnone, however humble, were either slighted or shunned.\r\n\r\nIn common with a younger sister and brother, I shared her care in my\r\nearly instruction, and found over one of the truest counsellors in a\r\nsister who scorned not the youngest mind nor the simplest intellectual\r\nwants in her love for communion, through converse or the silent page,\r\nwith the minds of the greatest and most gifted.\r\n\r\nDuring a lingering illness, in childhood, well do I remember her as\r\nthe angel of the sick-chamber, reading much to me from books useful\r\nand appropriate, and telling many a narrative not only fitted to wile\r\naway the pain of disease and the weariness of long confinement, but to\r\nelevate the mind and heart, and to direct them to all things noble and\r\nholy; over ready to watch while I slept, and to perform every gentle\r\nand kindly office. But her care of the sick--that she did not neglect,\r\nbut was eminent in that sphere of womanly duty, even when no tie of\r\nkindred claimed this of her, Mr. Cass's letter abundantly shows; and\r\nalso that this gentleness was united to a heroism which most call\r\nmanly, but which, I believe, may as justly be called truly womanly.\r\nMr. Cass's letter is inserted because it arrived too late to find a\r\nplace in her \"Memoirs,\" and yet more because it bears much on Margaret\r\nOssoli's characteristics as a woman.\r\n\r\nA few also of her private letters and papers, not bearing, save,\r\nindirectly, on the subject of this volume, are yet inserted in it, as\r\nfurther illustrative of her thought, feeling and action, in life's\r\nvarious relations. It is believed that nothing which exhibits a true\r\nwoman, especially in her relations to others as friend, sister,\r\ndaughter, wife, or mother, can fail to interest and be of value to her\r\nsex, indeed to all who are interested in human welfare and\r\nadvancement, since these latter so much depend on the fidelity of\r\nWoman. Nor will anything pertaining to the education and care of\r\nchildren be deemed irrelevant, especially by mothers, upon whom these\r\nduties must always largely devolve.\r\n\r\nOf the intellectual gifts and wide culture of Margaret Fuller there is\r\nno need that I should speak, nor is it wise that one standing in my\r\nrelation to her should. Those who knew her personally feel that no\r\nwords ever flowed from her pen equalling the eloquent utterances of\r\nher lips; yet her works, though not always a clear oppression of her\r\nthoughts, are the evidences to which the world will look as proof of\r\nher mental greatness.\r\n\r\nOn one point, however, I do wish to bear testimony--not needed with\r\nthose who knew her well, but interesting, perhaps, to some readers\r\ninto whose bands this volume may fall. It is on a subject which one\r\nwho knew her from his childhood up--at _home_, where best the\r\n_heart_ and _soul_ can be known,--in the unrestrained hours\r\nof domestic life,--in various scenes, and not for a few days, nor\r\nunder any peculiar circumstances--can speak with confidence, because\r\nhe speaks what he \"doth know, and testifieth what he hath seen.\" It\r\nrelates to her Christian faith and hope. \"With all her intellectual\r\ngifts, with all her high, moral, and noble characteristics,\" there are\r\nsome who will ask, \"was her intellectual power sanctified by Christian\r\nfaith as its basis? Were her moral qualities, her beneficent life, the\r\nresults of a renewed heart?\" I feel no hesitation here, nor would\r\nthink it worth while to answer such questions at all, were her life to\r\nbe read and known by all who read this volume, and were I not\r\ninfluenced also, in some degree, by the tone which has characterized a\r\nfew sectarian reviews of her works, chiefly in foreign periodicals.\r\nSurely, if the Saviour's test, \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\"\r\nbe the true one, Margaret Ossoli was preeminently a Christian. If a\r\nlife of constant self-sacrifice,--if devotion to the welfare of\r\nkindred and the race,--if conformity to what she believed God's law,\r\nso that her life seemed ever the truest form of prayer, active\r\nobedience to the Deity,--in fine, if carrying Christianity into all\r\nthe departments of action, so far as human infirmity allows,--if these\r\nbe the proofs of a Christian, then whoever has read her \"Memoirs\"\r\nthoughtfully, and without sectarian prejudice or the use of sectarian\r\nstandards of judgment, must feel her to have been a Christian. But not\r\nalone in outward life, in mind and heart, too, was she a Christian.\r\nThe being brought into frequent and intimate contact with religious\r\npersons has been one of the chief privileges of my vocation, but never\r\nyet have I met with any person whose reverence for holy things was\r\ndeeper than hers. Abhorring, as all honest minds must, every species\r\nof cant, she respected true religious thought and feeling, by\r\nwhomsoever cherished. God seemed nearer to her than to any person I\r\nhave over known. In the influences of His Holy Spirit upon the heart\r\nshe fully believed, and in experience realized them. Jesus, the friend\r\nof man, can never have been more truly loved and honored than she\r\nloved and honored him. I am aware that this is strong language, but\r\nstrength of language cannot equal the strength of my conviction on a\r\npoint where I have had the best opportunities of judgment. Rich as is\r\nthe religion of Jesus in its list of holy confessors, yet it can spare\r\nand would exclude none who in heart, mind and life, confessed and\r\nreverenced him as did she. Among my earliest recollections, is her\r\ndevoting much time to a thorough examination of the evidences of\r\nChristianity, and ultimately declaring that to her, better than all\r\narguments or usual processes of proof, was the soul's want of a divine\r\nreligion, and the voice within that soul which declared the teachings\r\nof Christ to be true and from God; and one of my most cherished\r\npossessions is that Bible which she so diligently and thoughtfully\r\nread, and which bears, in her own handwriting, so many proofs of\r\ndiscriminating and prayerful perusal. As in regard to reformatory\r\nmovements so here, she joined no organized body of believers,\r\nsympathizing with all of them whose views were noble and Christian;\r\ndeploring and bearing faithful testimony against anything she deemed\r\nnarrowness or perversion in theology or life.\r\n\r\nThis volume from her hand is now before the reader. The fact that a\r\nlarge share of it was never written or revised by its authoress for\r\npublication will be kept in view, as explaining any inaccuracy of\r\nexpression or repetition of thought, should such occur in its pages.\r\nNor will it be deemed surprising, if, in papers written by so\r\nprogressive a person, at so various periods of life, and under\r\nwidely-varied circumstances, there should not always be found perfect\r\nunion as to every expressed opinion.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this will soon be followed by another volume,\r\ncontaining a republication of \"Summer on the Lakes,\" and also the\r\n\"Letters from Europe,\" by the same hand.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this volume much valuable assistance has been\r\nafforded by Mr. Greeley, of the New York _Tribune_, who has been\r\nearnest in his desire and efforts for the diffusion of what Margaret\r\nhas written.\r\n\r\nA. B. F.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, _May 10th_, 1855.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe problem of Woman's position, or \"sphere,\"--of her duties,\r\nresponsibilities, rights and immunities as Woman,--fitly attracts a\r\nlarge and still-increasing measure of attention from the thinkers and\r\nagitators of our time, The legislators, so called,--those who\r\nultimately enact into statutes what the really governing class (to\r\nwit, the thinkers) have originated, matured and gradually commended to\r\nthe popular comprehension and acceptance,--are not as yet much\r\noccupied with this problem, only fitfully worried and more or less\r\nconsciously puzzled by it. More commonly they merely echo the mob's\r\nshallow retort to the petition of any strong-minded daughter or\r\nsister, who demands that she be allowed a voice in disposing of the\r\nmoney wrenched from her hard earnings by inexorable taxation, or in\r\nshaping the laws by which she is ruled, judged, and is liable to be\r\nsentenced to prison or to death, \"It is a woman's business to obey her\r\nhusband, keep his home tidy, and nourish and train his children.\" But\r\nwhen she rejoins to this, \"Very true; but suppose I choose not to have\r\na husband, or am not chosen for a wife--what then? I am still subject\r\nto your laws. Why am I not entitled, as a rational human being, to a\r\nvoice in shaping them? I have physical needs, and must somehow earn a\r\nliving. Why should I not be at liberty to earn it in any honest and\r\nuseful calling?\"--the mob's flout is hushed, and the legislator Is\r\nstruck dumb also. They were already at the end of their scanty\r\nresources of logic, and it would be cruel for woman to ask further:\r\n\"Suppose me a wife, and my husband a drunken prodigal--what am I to do\r\nthen? May I not earn food for my babes without being exposed to have\r\nit snatched from their mouths to replenish the rumseller's till, and\r\naggravate my husband's madness? If some sympathizing relative sees fit\r\nto leave me a bequest wherewith to keep my little ones together, why\r\nmay I not be legally enabled to secure this to their use and benefit?\r\nIn short, why am I not regarded by the law as a _soul_, responsible\r\nfor my acts to God and humanity, and not as a mere body, devoted to the\r\nunreasoning service of my husband?\" The state gives no answer, and the\r\nchampions of her policy evince wisdom in imitating her silence.\r\n\r\nThe writer of the following pages was one of the earliest as well as\r\nablest among American women, to demand for her sex equality before the\r\nlaw with her titular lord and master, Her writings on this subject\r\nhave the force which springs from the ripening of profound reflection\r\ninto assured conviction. She wrote as one who had observed, and who\r\ndeeply felt what she deliberately uttered. Others have since spoken\r\nmore fluently, more variously, with a greater affluence of\r\nillustration; but none, it is believed, more earnestly or more\r\nforcibly. It is due to her memory, as well as to the great and living\r\ncause of which she was so eminent and so fearless an advocate, that\r\nwhat she thought and said with regard to the position of her sex and\r\nits limitations, should be fully and fairly placed before the public.\r\nFor several years past her principal essay on \"Woman,\" here given, has\r\nnot been purchasable at any price, and has only with great difficulty\r\nbeen accessible to the general reader. To place it within the reach of\r\nthose who need and require it, is the main impulse to the publication\r\nof this volume; but the accompanying essays and papers will be found\r\nequally worthy of thoughtful consideration.\r\n\r\nH.

Besides, it offers a larger\r\nscope, and is, in that way, more just to my desire. I meant by that\r\ntitle to intimate the fact that, while it is the destiny of Man, in\r\nthe course of the ages, to ascertain and fulfil the law of his being,\r\nso that his life shall be seen, as a whole, to be that of an angel or\r\nmessenger, the action of prejudices and passions which attend, in the\r\nday, the growth of the individual, is continually obstructing the holy\r\nwork that is to make the earth a part of heaven. By Man I mean both\r\nman and woman; these are the two halves of one thought. I lay no\r\nespecial stress on the welfare of either. I believe that the\r\ndevelopment of the one cannot be effected without that of the other.\r\nMy highest wish is that this truth should be distinctly and rationally\r\napprehended, and the conditions of life and freedom recognized as the\r\nsame for the daughters and the sons of time; twin exponents of a\r\ndivine thought.\r\n\r\nI solicit a sincere and patient attention from those who open the\r\nfollowing pages at all. I solicit of women that they will lay it to\r\nheart to ascertain what is for them the liberty of law. It is for\r\nthis, and not for any, the largest, extension of partial privileges\r\nthat I seek. I ask them, if interested by these suggestions, to search\r\ntheir own experience and intuitions for better, and fill up with fit\r\nmaterials the trenches that hedge them in. From men I ask a noble and\r\nearnest attention to anything that can be offered on this great and\r\nstill obscure subject, such as I have met from many with whom I stand\r\nin private relations.\r\n\r\nAnd may truth, unpolluted by prejudice, vanity or selfishness, be\r\ngranted daily more and more as the due of inheritance, and only\r\nvaluable conquest for us all!\r\n\r\n_November_, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Frailty, thy name is WOMAN.\"\r\n  \"The Earth waits for her Queen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe connection between these quotations may not be obvious, but it is\r\nstrict. Yet would any contradict us, if we made them applicable to the\r\nother side, and began also,\r\n\r\n  Frailty, thy name is MAN.\r\n  The Earth waits for its King?\r\n\r\n\r\nYet Man, if not yet fully installed in his powers, has given much\r\nearnest of his claims. Frail he is indeed,--how frail! how impure!\r\nYet often has the vein of gold displayed itself amid the baser ores,\r\nand Man has appeared before us in princely promise worthy of his\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIf, oftentimes, we see the prodigal son feeding on the husks in the\r\nfair field no more his own, anon we raise the eyelids, heavy from\r\nbitter tears, to behold in him the radiant apparition of genius and\r\nlove, demanding not less than the all of goodness, power and beauty.\r\nWe see that in him the largest claim finds a due foundation. That\r\nclaim is for no partial sway, no exclusive possession. He cannot be\r\nsatisfied with any one gift of life, any one department of knowledge\r\nor telescopic peep at the heavens. He feels himself called to\r\nunderstand and aid Nature, that she may, through his intelligence, be\r\nraised and interpreted; to be a student of, and servant to, the\r\nuniverse-spirit; and king of his planet, that, as an angelic minister\r\nhe may bring it into conscious harmony with the law of that spirit.\r\n\r\nIn clear, triumphant moments, many times, has rung through the spheres\r\nthe prophecy of his jubilee; and those moments, though past in time,\r\nhave been translated into eternity by thought; the bright signs they\r\nleft hang in the heavens, as single stars or constellations, and,\r\nalready, a thickly sown radiance consoles the wanderer in the darkest\r\nnight. Other heroes since Hercules have fulfilled the zodiac of\r\nbeneficent labors, and then given up their mortal part to the fire\r\nwithout a murmur; while no God dared deny that they should have their\r\nreward,\r\n\r\n      Siquis tamen, Hercule, siquis\r\n  Forte Deo doliturus erit, daia praemia nollet,\r\n  Sed meruise dari sciet, invitus que probabit,\r\n      Assensere Dei\r\n\r\n\r\nSages and lawgivers have bent their whole nature to the search for\r\ntruth, and thought themselves happy if they could buy, with the\r\nsacrifice of all temporal ease and pleasure, one seed for the future\r\nEden. Poets and priests have strung the lyre with the heart-strings,\r\npoured out their best blood upon the altar, which, reared anew from\r\nage to age, shall at last sustain the flame pure enough to rise to\r\nhighest heaven. Shall we not name with as deep a benediction those\r\nwho, if not so immediately, or so consciously, in connection with the\r\neternal truth, yet, led and fashioned by a divine instinct, serve no\r\nless to develop and interpret the open secret of love passing into\r\nlife, energy creating for the purpose of happiness; the artist whose\r\nhand, drawn by a preexistent harmony to a certain medium, moulds it\r\nto forms of life more highly and completely organized than are seen\r\nelsewhere, and, by carrying out the intention of nature, reveals her\r\nmeaning to those who are not yet wise enough to divine it; the\r\nphilosopher who listens steadily for laws and causes, and from those\r\nobvious infers those yet unknown; the historian who, in faith that all\r\nevents must have their reason and their aim, records them, and thus\r\nfills archives from which the youth of prophets may be fed; the man of\r\nscience dissecting the statements, testing the facts and demonstrating\r\norder, even where he cannot its purpose?\r\n\r\nLives, too, which bear none of these names, have yielded tones of no\r\nless significance. The candlestick set in a low place has given light\r\nas faithfully, where it was needed, as that upon the hill, In close\r\nalleys, in dismal nooks, the Word has been read as distinctly, as when\r\nshown by angels to holy men in the dark prison. Those who till a spot\r\nof earth scarcely larger than is wanted for a grave, have deserved\r\nthat the sun should shine upon its sod till violets answer.\r\n\r\nSo great has been, from time to time, the promise, that, in all ages,\r\nmen have said the gods themselves came down to dwell with them; that\r\nthe All-Creating wandered on the earth to taste, in a limited nature,\r\nthe sweetness of virtue; that the All-Sustaining incarnated himself to\r\nguard, in space and time, the destinies of this world; that heavenly\r\ngenius dwelt among the shepherds, to sing to them and teach them how\r\nto sing. Indeed,\r\n\r\n  \"Der stets den Hirten gnadig sich bewies.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He has constantly shown himself favorable to shepherds.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the dwellers in green pastures and natural students of the stars\r\nwere selected to hail, first among men, the holy child, whose life and\r\ndeath were to present the type of excellence, which has sustained the\r\nheart of so large a portion of mankind in these later generations.\r\n\r\nSuch marks have been made by the footsteps of _man_ (still, alas!\r\nto be spoken of as the _ideal_ man), wherever he has passed\r\nthrough the wilderness of _men_, and whenever the pigmies stepped\r\nin one of those, they felt dilate within the breast somewhat that\r\npromised nobler stature and purer blood. They were impelled to forsake\r\ntheir evil ways of decrepit scepticism and covetousness of corruptible\r\npossessions. Convictions flowed in upon them. They, too, raised the\r\ncry: God is living, now, to-day; and all beings are brothers, for they\r\nare his children. Simple words enough, yet which only angelic natures\r\ncan use or hear in their full, free sense.\r\n\r\nThese were the triumphant moments; but soon the lower nature took its\r\nturn, and the era of a truly human life was postponed.\r\n\r\nThus is man still a stranger to his inheritance, still a pleader,\r\nstill a pilgrim. Yet his happiness is secure in the end. And now, no\r\nmore a glimmering consciousness, but assurance begins to be felt and\r\nspoken, that the highest ideal Man can form of his own powers is that\r\nwhich he is destined to attain. Whatever the soul knows how to seek,\r\nit cannot fail to obtain. This is the Law and the Prophets. Knock and\r\nit shall be opened; seek and ye shall find. It is demonstrated; it is\r\na maxim. Man no longer paints his proper nature in some form, and\r\nsays, \"Prometheus had it; it is God-like;\" but \"Man must have it; it\r\nis human.\" However disputed by many, however ignorantly used, or\r\nfalsified by those who do receive it, the fact of an universal,\r\nunceasing revelation has been too clearly stated in words to be lost\r\nsight of in thought; and sermons preached from the text, \"Be ye\r\nperfect,\" are the only sermons of a pervasive and deep-searching\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nBut, among those who meditate upon this text, there is a great\r\ndifference of view as to the way in which perfection shall be sought.\r\n\r\n\"Through the intellect,\" say some. \"Gather from every growth of life\r\nits seed of thought; look behind every symbol for its law; if thou\r\ncanst _see_ clearly, the rest will follow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Through the life,\" say others. \"Do the best thou knowest today.\r\nShrink not from frequent error in this gradual, fragmentary state.\r\nFollow thy light for as much as it will show thee; be faithful as far\r\nas thou canst, in hope that faith presently will lead to sight. Help\r\nothers, without blaming their need of thy help. Love much, and be\r\nforgiven.\"\r\n\r\n\"It needs not intellect, needs not experience,\" says a third. \"If you\r\ntook the true way, your destiny would be accomplished, in a purer and\r\nmore natural order. You would not learn through facts of thought or\r\naction, but express through them the certainties of wisdom. In\r\nquietness yield thy soul to the causal soul. Do not disturb thy\r\napprenticeship by premature effort; neither check the tide of\r\ninstruction by methods of thy own. Be still; seek not, but wait in\r\nobedience. Thy commission will be given.\"\r\n\r\nCould we indeed say what we want, could we give a description of the\r\nchild that is lost, he would be found. As soon as the soul can affirm\r\nclearly that a certain demonstration is wanted, it is at hand. When\r\nthe Jewish prophet described the Lamb, as the expression of what was\r\nrequired by the coming era, the time drew nigh. But we say not, see\r\nnot as yet, clearly, what we would. Those who call for a more\r\ntriumphant expression of love, a love that cannot be crucified, show\r\nnot a perfect sense of what has already been given. Love has already\r\nbeen expressed, that made all things new, that gave the worm its place\r\nand ministry as well as the eagle; a love to which it was alike to\r\ndescend into the depths of hell, or to sit at the right hand of the\r\nFather.\r\n\r\nYet, no doubt, a new manifestation is at hand, a new hour in the day\r\nof Man. We cannot expect to see any one sample of completed being,\r\nwhen the mass of men still lie engaged in the sod, or use the freedom\r\nof their limbs only with wolfish energy. The tree cannot come to\r\nflower till its root be free from the cankering worm, and its whole\r\ngrowth open to air and light. While any one is base, none can be\r\nentirely free and noble. Yet something new shall presently be shown of\r\nthe life of man, for hearts crave, if minds do not know how to ask it.\r\n\r\nAmong the strains of prophecy, the following, by an earnest mind of a\r\nforeign land, written some thirty years ago, is not yet outgrown; and\r\nit has the merit of being a positive appeal from the heart, instead of\r\na critical declaration what Man should _not_ do.\r\n\r\n\"The ministry of Man implies that he must be filled from the divine\r\nfountains which are being engendered through all eternity, so that, at\r\nthe mere name of his master, he may be able to cast all his enemies\r\ninto the abyss; that he may deliver all parts of nature from the\r\nbarriers that imprison them; that he may purge the terrestrial\r\natmosphere from the poisons that infect it; that he may preserve the\r\nbodies of men from the corrupt influences that surround, and the\r\nmaladies that afflict them; still more, that he may keep their souls\r\npure from the malignant insinuations which pollute, and the gloomy\r\nimages that obscure them; that he may restore its serenity to the\r\nWord, which false words of men fill with mourning and sadness; that he\r\nmay satisfy the desires of the angels, who await from him the\r\ndevelopment of the marvels of nature; that, in fine, his world may be\r\nfilled with God, as eternity is.\" [Footnote: St. Martin]\r\n\r\nAnother attempt we will give, by an obscure observer of our own day\r\nand country, to draw some lines of the desired image. It was suggested\r\nby seeing the design of Crawford's Orpheus, and connecting with the\r\ncircumstance of the American, in his garret at Rome, making choice of\r\nthis subject, that of Americans here at home showing such ambition to\r\nrepresent the character, by calling their prose and verse \"Orphic\r\nsayings\"--\"Orphics.\" We wish we could add that they have shown that\r\nmusical apprehension of the progress of Nature through her ascending\r\ngradations which entitled them so to do, but their attempts are\r\nfrigid, though sometimes grand; in their strain we are not warmed by\r\nthe fire which fertilized the soil of Greece.\r\n\r\nOrpheus was a lawgiver by theocratic commission. He understood nature,\r\nand made her forms move to his music. He told her secrets in the form\r\nof hymns, Nature as seen in the mind of God. His soul went forth\r\ntoward all beings, yet could remain sternly faithful to a chosen type\r\nof excellence. Seeking what he loved, he feared not death nor hell;\r\nneither could any shape of dread daunt his faith in the power of the\r\ncelestial harmony that filled his soul.\r\n\r\nIt seemed significant of the state of things in this country, that the\r\nsculptor should have represented the seer at the moment when he was\r\nobliged with his hand to shade his eyes.\r\n\r\n  Each Orpheus must to the depths descend;\r\n    For only thus the Poet can be wise;\r\n  Must make the sad Persephone his friend,\r\n    And buried love to second life arise;\r\n  Again his love must lose through too much love,\r\n    Must lose his life by living life too true,\r\n  For what he sought below is passed above,\r\n    Already done is all that he would do\r\n  Must tune all being with his single lyre,\r\n    Must melt all rooks free from their primal pain,\r\n  Must search all nature with his one soul's fire,\r\n    Must bind anew all forms in heavenly chain.\r\n  If he already sees what he must do,\r\n    Well may he shade his eyes from the far-shining view.\r\n\r\n\r\nA better comment could not be made on what is required to perfect Man,\r\nand place him in that superior position for which he was designed,\r\nthan by the interpretation of Bacon upon the legends of the Syren\r\ncoast \"When the wise Ulysses passed,\" says he, \"he caused his mariners\r\nto stop their ears, with wax, knowing there was in them no power to\r\nresist the lure of that voluptuous song. But he, the much experienced\r\nman, who wished to be experienced in all, and use all to the service\r\nof wisdom, desired to hear the song that he might understand its\r\nmeaning. Yet, distrusting his own power to be firm in his better\r\npurpose, he caused himself to be bound to the mast, that he might be\r\nkept secure against his own weakness. But Orpheus passed unfettered,\r\nso absorbed in singing hymns to the gods that he could not even hear\r\nthose sounds of degrading enchantment.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, not a few believe, and men themselves have expressed the\r\nopinion, that the time is come when Eurydice is to call for an\r\nOrpheus, rather than Orpheus for Eurydice; that the idea of Man,\r\nhowever imperfectly brought out, has been far more so than that of\r\nWoman; that she, the other half of the same thought, the other chamber\r\nof the heart of life, needs now take her turn in the full pulsation,\r\nand that improvement in the daughters will best aid in the reformation\r\nof the sons of this age.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better\r\nunderstood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in\r\nbehalf of Woman. As men become aware that few men have had a fair\r\nchance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance.\r\nThe French Revolution, that strangely disguised angel, bore witness in\r\nfavor of Woman, but interpreted her claims no less ignorantly than\r\nthose of Man. Its idea of happiness did not rise beyond outward\r\nenjoyment, unobstructed by the tyranny of others. The title it gave\r\nwas \"citoyen,\" \"citoyenne;\" and it is not unimportant to Woman that\r\neven this species of equality was awarded her. Before, she could be\r\ncondemned to perish on the scaffold for treason, not as a citizen, but\r\nas a subject. The right with which this title then invested a human\r\nbeing was that of bloodshed and license. The Goddess of Liberty was\r\nimpure. As we read the poem addressed to her, not long since, by\r\nBeranger, we can scarcely refrain from tears as painful as the tears\r\nof blood that flowed when \"such crimes were committed in her name.\"\r\nYes! Man, born to purify and animate the unintelligent and the cold,\r\ncan, in his madness, degrade and pollute no less the fair and the\r\nchaste. Yet truth was prophesied in the ravings of that hideous fever,\r\ncaused by long ignorance and abuse. Europe is conning a valued lesson\r\nfrom the blood-stained page. The same tendencies, further unfolded,\r\nwill bear good fruit in this country.\r\n\r\nYet, by men in this country, as by the Jews, when Moses was leading\r\nthem to the promised land, everything has been done that inherited\r\ndepravity could do, to hinder the promise of Heaven from its\r\nfulfilment. The cross, here as elsewhere, has been planted only to be\r\nblasphemed by cruelty and fraud. The name of the Prince of Peace has\r\nbeen profaned by all kinds of injustice toward the Gentile whom he\r\nsaid he came to save. But I need not speak of what has been done\r\ntowards the Red Man, the Black Man. Those deeds are the scoff of the\r\nworld; and they have been accompanied by such pious words that the\r\ngentlest would not dare to intercede with \"Father, forgive them, for\r\nthey know not what they do.\"\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, the gain of creation consists always in the growth\r\nof individual minds, which live and aspire, as flowers bloom and birds\r\nsing, in the midst of morasses; and in the continual development of\r\nthat thought, the thought of human destiny, which is given to eternity\r\nadequately to express, and which ages of failure only seemingly\r\nimpede. Only seemingly; and whatever seems to the contrary, this\r\ncountry is as surely destined to elucidate a great moral law, as\r\nEurope was to promote the mental culture of Man.\r\n\r\nThough the national independence be blurred by the servility of\r\nindividuals; though freedom and equality have been proclaimed only to\r\nleave room for a monstrous display of slave-dealing and slave-keeping;\r\nthough the free American so often feels himself free, like the Roman,\r\nonly to pamper his appetites end his indolence through the misery of\r\nhis fellow-beings; still it is not in vain that the verbal statement\r\nhas been made, \"All men are born free and equal.\" There it stands, a\r\ngolden certainty wherewith to encourage the good, to shame the bad.\r\nThe New World may be called clearly to perceive that it incurs the\r\nutmost penalty if it reject or oppress the sorrowful brother. And, if\r\nmen are deaf, the angels hear. But men cannot be deaf. It is\r\ninevitable that an external freedom, an independence of the\r\nencroachments of other men, such as has been achieved for the nation,\r\nshould be so also for every member of it. That which has once been\r\nclearly conceived in the intelligence cannot fail, sooner or later, to\r\nbe acted out. It has become a law as irrevocable as that of the Medes\r\nin their ancient dominion; men will privately sin against it, but the\r\nlaw, as expressed by a leading mind of the age,\r\n\r\n  \"Tutti fatti a semblanza d'un Solo,\r\n  Figli tutti d'un solo riscatto,\r\n  In qual'ora, in qual parte del suolo\r\n  Trascorriamo quest' aura vital,\r\n  Siam fratelli, siam stretti ad un patto:\r\n  Maladetto colui che lo infrange,\r\n  Che s'innalza sul finoco che piange\r\n  Che contrista uno spirto immortal.\" [Footnote: Manzoni]\r\n\r\n  \"All made in the likeness of the One.\r\n    All children of one ransom,\r\n  In whatever hour, in whatever part of the soil,\r\n    We draw this vital air,\r\n  We are brothers; we must be bound by one compact;\r\n    Accursed he who infringes it,\r\n  Who raises himself upon the weak who weep,\r\n    Who saddens an immortal spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis law cannot fail of universal recognition. Accursed be he who\r\nwillingly saddens an immortal spirit--doomed to infamy in later, wiser\r\nages, doomed in future stages of his own being to deadly penance, only\r\nshort of death. Accursed be he who sins in ignorance, if that\r\nignorance be caused by sloth.\r\n\r\nWe sicken no less at the pomp than the strife of words. We feel that\r\nnever were lungs so puffed with the wind of declamation, on moral and\r\nreligious subjects, as now. We are tempted to implore these\r\n\"word-heroes,\" these word-Catos, word-Christs, to beware of cant\r\n[Footnote: Dr. Johnson's one piece of advice should be written on\r\nevery door: \"Clear your mind of cant.\" But Byron, to whom it was so\r\nacceptable, in clearing away the noxious vine, shook down the\r\nbuilding. Sterling's emendation is worthy of honor:\r\n\r\n  \"Realize your cant, not cast it off.\"]\r\n\r\nabove all things; to remember that hypocrisy is the most hopeless as\r\nwell as the meanest of crimes, and that those must surely be polluted\r\nby it, who do not reserve a part of their morality and religion for\r\nprivate use. Landor says that he cannot have a great deal of mind who\r\ncannot afford to let the larger part of it lie fallow; and what is true\r\nof genius is not less so of virtue. The tongue is a valuable member,\r\nbut should appropriate but a small part of the vital juices that are\r\nneedful all over the body. We feel that the mind may \"grow black and\r\nrancid in the smoke\" even \"of altars.\" We start up from the harangue\r\nto go into our closet and shut the door. There inquires the spirit,\r\n\"Is this rhetoric the bloom of healthy blood, or a false pigment\r\nartfully laid on?\" And yet again we know where is so much smoke, must\r\nbe some fire; with so much talk about virtue and freedom, must be\r\nmingled some desire for them; that it cannot be in vain that such have\r\nbecome the common topics of conversation among men, rather than schemes\r\nfor tyranny and plunder, that the very newspapers see it best to\r\nproclaim themselves \"Pilgrims,\" \"Puritans,\" \"Heralds of Holiness.\" The\r\nking that maintains so costly a retinue cannot be a mere boast, or\r\nCarabbas fiction. We have waited here long in the dust; we are tired\r\nand hungry; but the triumphal procession must appear at last.\r\n\r\nOf all its banners, none has been more steadily upheld, and under none\r\nhave more valor and willingness for real sacrifices been shown, than\r\nthat of the champions of the enslaved African. And this band it is,\r\nwhich, partly from a natural following out of principles, partly\r\nbecause many women have been prominent in that cause, makes, just now,\r\nthe warmest appeal in behalf of Woman.\r\n\r\nThough there has been a growing liberality on this subject, yet\r\nsociety at large is not so prepared for the demands of this party, but\r\nthat its members are, and will be for some time, coldly regarded as\r\nthe Jacobins of their day.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not enough,\" cries the irritated trader, \"that you have done\r\nall you could to break up the national union, and thus destroy the\r\nprosperity of our country, but now you must be trying to break up\r\nfamily union, to take my wife away from the cradle and the\r\nkitchen-hearth to vote at polls, and preach from a pulpit? Of course,\r\nif she does such things, she cannot attend to those of her own sphere.\r\nShe is happy enough as she is. She has more leisure than I\r\nhave,--every means of improvement, every indulgence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you asked her whether she was satisfied with these\r\n_indulgences_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I know she is. She is too amiable to desire what would make\r\nme unhappy, and too judicious to wish to step beyond the sphere of her\r\nsex. I will never consent to have our peace disturbed by any such\r\ndiscussions.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Consent--you?' it is not consent from you that is in question--it is\r\nassent from your wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am not I the head of my house?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not the head of your wife. God has given her a mind of her own.\r\n\r\n\"I am the head, and she the heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"God grant you play true to one another, then! I suppose I am to be\r\ngrateful that you did not say she was only the hand. If the head\r\nrepresses no natural pulse of the heart, there can be no question as\r\nto your giving your consent. Both will be of one accord, and there\r\nneeds but to present any question to get a full and true answer. There\r\nis no need of precaution, of indulgence, nor consent. But our doubt is\r\nwhether the heart _does_ consent with the head, or only obeys its\r\ndecrees with a passiveness that precludes the exercise of its natural\r\npowers, or a repugnance that turns sweet qualities to bitter, or a\r\ndoubt that lays waste the fair occasions of life. It is to ascertain\r\nthe truth that we propose some liberating measures.\"\r\n\r\nThus vaguely are these questions proposed and discussed at present.\r\nBut their being proposed at all implies much thought, and suggests\r\nmore. Many women are considering within themselves what they need that\r\nthey have not, and what they can have if they find they need it. Many\r\nmen are considering whether women are capable of being and having more\r\nthan they are and have, _and_ whether, if so, it will be best to\r\nconsent to improvement in their condition.\r\n\r\nThis morning, I open the Boston \"Daily Mail,\" and find in its \"poet's\r\ncorner\" a translation of Schiller's \"Dignity of Woman.\" In the\r\nadvertisement of a book on America, I see in the table of contents\r\nthis sequence, \"Republican Institutions. American Slavery. American\r\nLadies.\"\r\n\r\nI open the \"_Deutsche Schnellpost_\" published in New York, and\r\nfind at the head of a column, _Juden und Frauenemancipation in\r\nUngarn_--\"Emancipation of Jews and Women in Hungary.\"\r\n\r\nThe past year has seen action in the Rhode Island legislature, to\r\nsecure married women rights over their own property, where men showed\r\nthat a very little examination of the subject could teach them much;\r\nan article in the Democratic Review on the same subject more largely\r\nconsidered, written by a woman, impelled, it is said, by glaring wrong\r\nto a distinguished friend, having shown the defects in the existing\r\nlaws, and the state of opinion from which they spring; and on answer\r\nfrom the revered old man, J. Q. Adams, in some respects the Phocion of\r\nhis time, to an address made him by some ladies. To this last I shall\r\nagain advert in another place.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms of the times have come under my view quite\r\naccidentally: one who seeks, may, each month or week, collect more.\r\n\r\nThe numerous party, whose opinions are already labeled and adjusted\r\ntoo much to their mind to admit of any new light, strive, by lectures\r\non some model-woman of bride-like beauty and gentleness, by writing\r\nand lending little treatises, intended to mark out with precision the\r\nlimits of Woman's sphere, and Woman's mission, to prevent other than\r\nthe rightful shepherd from climbing the wall, or the flock from using\r\nany chance to go astray.\r\n\r\nWithout enrolling ourselves at once on either side, let us look upon\r\nthe subject from the best point of view which to-day offers; no\r\nbetter, it is to be feared, than a high house-top. A high hill-top, or\r\nat least a cathedral-spire, would be desirable.\r\n\r\nIt may well be an Anti-Slavery party that pleads for Woman, if we\r\nconsider merely that she does not hold property on equal terms with\r\nmen; so that, if a husband dies without making a will, the wife,\r\ninstead of taking at once his place as head of the family, inherits\r\nonly a part of his fortune, often brought him by herself, as if she\r\nwere a child, or ward only, not an equal partner.\r\n\r\nWe will not speak of the innumerable instances in which profligate and\r\nidle men live upon the earnings of industrious wives; or if the wives\r\nleave them, and take with them the children, to perform the double\r\nduty of mother and father, follow from place to place, and threaten to\r\nrob them of the children, if deprived of the rights of a husband, as\r\nthey call them, planting themselves in their poor lodgings,\r\nfrightening them into paying tribute by taking from them the children,\r\nrunning into debt at the expense of these otherwise so overtasked\r\nhelots. Such instances count up by scores within my own memory. I have\r\nseen the husband who had stained himself by a long course of low vice,\r\ntill his wife was wearied from her heroic forgiveness, by finding that\r\nhis treachery made it useless, and that if she would provide bread for\r\nherself and her children, she must be separate from his ill fame--I\r\nhave known this man come to install himself in the chamber of a woman\r\nwho loathed him, and say she should never take food without his\r\ncompany. I have known these men steal their children, whom they knew\r\nthey had no means to maintain, take them into dissolute company,\r\nexpose them to bodily danger, to frighten the poor woman, to whom, it\r\nseems, the fact that she alone had borne the pangs of their birth, and\r\nnourished their infancy, does not give an equal right to them. I do\r\nbelieve that this mode of kidnapping--and it is frequent enough in all\r\nclasses of society--will be by the next age viewed as it is by Heaven\r\nnow, and that the man who avails himself of the shelter of men's laws\r\nto steal from a mother her own children, or arrogate any superior\r\nright in them, save that of superior virtue, will bear the stigma he\r\ndeserves, in common with him who steals grown men from their\r\nmother-land, their hopes, and their homes.\r\n\r\nI said, we will not speak of this now; yet I _have_ spoken, for\r\nthe subject makes me feel too much. I could give instances that would\r\nstartle the most vulgar and callous; but I will not, for the public\r\nopinion of their own sex is already against such men, and where cases\r\nof extreme tyranny are made known, there is private action in the\r\nwife's favor. But she ought not to need this, nor, I think, can she\r\nlong. Men must soon see that as, on their own ground, Woman is the\r\nweaker party, she ought to have legal protection, which would make\r\nsuch oppression impossible. But I would not deal with \"atrocious\r\ninstances,\" except in the way of illustration, neither demand from men\r\na partial redress in some one matter, but go to the root of the whole.\r\nIf principles could be established, particulars would adjust\r\nthemselves aright. Ascertain the true destiny of Woman; give her\r\nlegitimate hopes, and a standard within herself; marriage and all\r\nother relations would by degrees be harmonized with these.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the historical progress of this matter. Knowing that\r\nthere exists in the minds of men a tone of feeling toward women as\r\ntoward slaves, such as is expressed in the common phrase, \"Tell that\r\nto women and children;\" that the infinite soul can only work through\r\nthem in already ascertained limits; that the gift of reason, Man's\r\nhighest prerogative, is allotted to them in much lower degree; that\r\nthey must be kept from mischief and melancholy by being constantly\r\nengaged in active labor, which is to be furnished and directed by\r\nthose better able to think, &c., &c.,--we need not multiply instances,\r\nfor who can review the experience of last week without recalling words\r\nwhich imply, whether in jest or earnest, these views, or views like\r\nthese,--knowing this, can we wonder that many reformers think that\r\nmeasures are not likely to be taken in behalf of women, unless their\r\nwishes could be publicly represented by women?\r\n\r\n\"That can never be necessary,\" cry the other side. \"All men are\r\nprivately influenced by women; each has his wife, sister, or female\r\nfriends, and is too much biased by these relations to fail of\r\nrepresenting their interests; and, if this is not enough, let them\r\npropose and enforce their wishes with the pen. The beauty of home\r\nwould be destroyed, the delicacy of the sex be violated, the dignity\r\nof halls of legislation degraded, by an attempt to introduce them\r\nthere. Such duties are inconsistent with those of a mother;\" and then\r\nwe have ludicrous pictures of ladies in hysterics at the polls, and\r\nsenate-chambers filled with cradles.\r\n\r\nBut if, in reply, we admit as truth that Woman seems destined by\r\nnature rather for the inner circle, we must add that the arrangements\r\nof civilized life have not been, as yet, such as to secure it to her.\r\nHer circle, if the duller, is not the quieter. If kept from\r\n\"excitement,\" she is not from drudgery. Not only the Indian squaw\r\ncarries the burdens of the camp, but the favorites of Louis XIV.\r\naccompany him in his journeys, and the washerwoman stands at her tub,\r\nand carries home her work at all seasons, and in all states of health.\r\nThose who think the physical circumstances of Woman would make a part\r\nin the affairs of national government unsuitable, are by no means\r\nthose who think it impossible for negresses to endure field-work, even\r\nduring pregnancy, or for sempstresses to go through their killing\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\nAs to the use of the pen, there was quite as much opposition to\r\nWoman's possessing herself of that help to free agency as there is now\r\nto her seizing on the rostrum or the desk; and she is likely to draw,\r\nfrom a permission to plead her cause that way, opposite inferences to\r\nwhat might be wished by those who now grant it.\r\n\r\nAs to the possibility of her filling with grace and dignity any such\r\nposition, we should think those who had seen the great actresses, and\r\nheard the Quaker preachers of modern times, would not doubt that Woman\r\ncan express publicly the fulness of thought and creation, without\r\nlosing any of the peculiar beauty of her sex. What can pollute and\r\ntarnish is to act thus from any motive except that something needs to\r\nbe said or done. Woman could take part in the processions, the songs,\r\nthe dances of old religion; no one fancied her delicacy was impaired\r\nby appearing in public for such a cause.\r\n\r\nAs to her home, she is not likely to leave it more than she now does\r\nfor balls, theatres, meetings for promoting missions, revival\r\nmeetings, and others to which she flies, in hope of an animation for\r\nher existence commensurate with what she sees enjoyed by men.\r\nGovernors of ladies'-fairs are no less engrossed by such a charge,\r\nthan the governor of a state by his; presidents of Washingtonian\r\nsocieties no less away from home than presidents of conventions. If\r\nmen look straitly to it, they will find that, unless their lives are\r\ndomestic, those of the women will not be. A house is no home unless it\r\ncontain food and fire for the mind as well as for the body. The female\r\nGreek, of our day, is as much in the street as the male to cry, \"What\r\nnews?\" We doubt not it was the same in Athens of old. The women, shut\r\nout from the market-place, made up for it at the religious festivals.\r\nFor human beings are not so constituted that they can live without\r\nexpansion. If they do not get it in one way, they must in another, or\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nAs to men's representing women fairly at present, while we hear from\r\nmen who owe to their wives not only all that is comfortable or\r\ngraceful, but all that is wise, in the arrangement of their lives, the\r\nfrequent remark, \"You cannot reason with a woman,\"--when from those of\r\ndelicacy, nobleness, and poetic culture, falls the contemptuous phrase\r\n\"women and children,\" and that in no light sally of the hour, but in\r\nworks intended to give a permanent statement of the best\r\nexperiences,--when not one man, in the million, shall I say? no, not\r\nin the hundred million, can rise above the belief that Woman was made\r\n_for Man_,--when such traits as these are daily forced upon the\r\nattention, can we feel that Man will always do justice to the\r\ninterests of Woman? Can we think that he takes a sufficiently\r\ndiscerning and religious view of her office and destiny _ever_ to\r\ndo her justice, except when prompted by sentiment,--accidentally or\r\ntransiently, that is, for the sentiment will vary according to the\r\nrelations in which he is placed? The lover, the poet, the artist, are\r\nlikely to view her nobly. The father and the philosopher have some\r\nchance of liberality; the man of the world, the legislator for\r\nexpediency, none.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, without attaching importance, in\r\nthemselves, to the changes demanded by the champions of Woman, we hail\r\nthem as signs of the times. We would have every arbitrary barrier\r\nthrown down. We would have every path laid open to Woman as freely as\r\nto Man. Were this done, and a slight temporary fermentation allowed to\r\nsubside, we should see crystallizations more pure and of more various\r\nbeauty. We believe the divine energy would pervade nature to a degree\r\nunknown in the history of former ages, and that no discordant\r\ncollision, but a ravishing harmony of the spheres, would ensue.\r\n\r\nYet, then and only then will mankind be ripe for this, when inward and\r\noutward freedom for Woman as much as for Man shall be acknowledged as\r\na _right_, not yielded as a concession. As the friend of the\r\nnegro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so\r\nshould the friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even\r\nwell-meant restrictions on Woman. If the negro be a soul, if the woman\r\nbe a soul, apparelled in flesh, to one Master only are they\r\naccountable. There is but one law for souls, and, if there is to be an\r\ninterpreter of it, he must come not as man, or son of man, but as son\r\nof God.\r\n\r\nWere thought and feeling once so far elevated that Man should esteem\r\nhimself the brother and friend, but nowise the lord and tutor, of\r\nWoman,--were he really bound with her in equal worship,--arrangements\r\nas to function and employment would be of no consequence. What Woman\r\nneeds is not as a woman to act or rule, but as a nature to grow, as an\r\nintellect to discern, as a soul to live freely and unimpeded, to\r\nunfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home. If\r\nfewer talents were given her, yet if allowed the free and full\r\nemployment of these, so that she may render back to the giver his own\r\nwith usury, she will not complain; nay, I dare to say she will bless\r\nand rejoice in her earthly birth-place, her earthly lot. Let us\r\nconsider what obstructions impede this good era, and what signs give\r\nreason to hope that it draws near.\r\n\r\nI was talking on this subject with Miranda, a woman, who, if any in\r\nthe world could, might speak without heat and bitterness of the\r\nposition of her sex. Her father was a man who cherished no sentimental\r\nreverence for Woman, but a firm belief in the equality of the sexes.\r\nShe was his eldest child, and came to him at an age when he needed a\r\ncompanion. From the time she could speak and go alone, he addressed\r\nher not as a plaything, but as a living mind. Among the few verses he\r\never wrote was a copy addressed to this child, when the first locks\r\nwere cut from her head; and the reverence expressed on this occasion\r\nfor that cherished head, he never belied. It was to him the temple of\r\nimmortal intellect. He respected his child, however, too much to be an\r\nindulgent parent. He called on her for clear judgment, for courage,\r\nfor honor and fidelity; in short, for such virtues as he knew. In so\r\nfar as he possessed the keys to the wonders of this universe, he\r\nallowed free use of them to her, and, by the incentive of a high\r\nexpectation, he forbade, so far as possible, that she should let the\r\nprivilege lie idle.\r\n\r\nThus this child was early led to feel herself a child of the spirit.\r\nShe took her place easily, not only in the world of organized being,\r\nbut in the world of mind. A dignified sense of self-dependence was\r\ngiven as all her portion, and she found it a sure anchor. Herself\r\nsecurely anchored, her relations with others were established with\r\nequal security. She was fortunate in a total absence of those charms\r\nwhich might have drawn to her bewildering flatteries, and in a strong\r\nelectric nature, which repelled those who did not belong to her, and\r\nattracted those who did. With men and women her relations were\r\nnoble,--affectionate without passion, intellectual without coldness.\r\nThe world was free to her, and she lived freely in it. Outward\r\nadversity came, and inward conflict; but that faith and self-respect\r\nhad early been awakened which must always lead, at last, to an outward\r\nserenity and an inward peace.\r\n\r\nOf Miranda I had always thought as an example, that the restraints\r\nupon the sex were insuperable only to those who think them so, or who\r\nnoisily strive to break them. She had taken a course of her own, and\r\nno man stood in her way. Many of her acts had been unusual, but\r\nexcited no uproar. Few helped, but none checked her; and the many men\r\nwho knew her mind and her life, showed to her confidence as to a\r\nbrother, gentleness as to a sister. And not only refined, but very\r\ncoarse men approved and aided one in whom they saw resolution and\r\nclearness of design. Her mind was often the leading one, always\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nWhen I talked with her upon these matters, and had said very much what\r\nI have written, she smilingly replied; \"And yet we must admit that I\r\nhave been fortunate, and this should not be. My good father's early\r\ntrust gave the first bias, and the rest followed, of course. It is\r\ntrue that I have had less outward aid, in after years, than most\r\nwomen; but that is of little consequence. Religion was early awakened\r\nin my soul,--a sense that what the soul is capable to ask it must\r\nattain, and that, though I might be aided and instructed by others, I\r\nmust depend on myself as the only constant friend. This\r\nself-dependence, which was honored in me, is deprecated as a fault in\r\nmost women. They are taught to learn their rule from without, not to\r\nunfold it from within.\r\n\r\n\"This is the fault of Man, who is still vain, and wishes to be more\r\nimportant to Woman than, by right, he should be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men have not shown this disposition toward you,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"No; because the position I early was enabled to take was one of\r\nself-reliance. And were all women as sure of their wants as I was, the\r\nresult would be the same. But they are so overloaded with precepts by\r\nguardians, who think that nothing is so much to be dreaded for a woman\r\nas originality of thought or character, that their minds are impeded\r\nby doubts till they lose their chance of fair, free proportions. The\r\ndifficulty is to got them to the point from which they shall naturally\r\ndevelop self-respect, and learn self-help.\r\n\r\n\"Once I thought that men would help to forward this state of things\r\nmore than I do now. I saw so many of them wretched in the connections\r\nthey had formed in weakness and vanity. They seemed so glad to esteem\r\nwomen whenever they could.\r\n\r\n\"'The soft arms of affection,' said one of the most discerning\r\nspirits, 'will not suffice for me, unless on them I see the steel\r\nbracelets of strength.'\r\n\r\n\"But early I perceived that men never, in any extreme of despair,\r\nwished to be women. On the contrary, they were ever ready to taunt one\r\nanother, at any sign of weakness, with,\r\n\r\n  \"'Art thou not like the women, who,'--\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passage ends various ways, according to the occasion and rhetoric\r\nof the speaker. When they admired any woman, they were inclined to\r\nspeak of her as 'above her sex.' Silently I observed this, and feared\r\nit argued a rooted scepticism, which for ages had been fastening on\r\nthe heart, and which only an age of miracles could eradicate. Ever I\r\nhave been treated with great sincerity; and I look upon it as a signal\r\ninstance of this, that an intimate friend of the other sex said, in a\r\nfervent moment, that I 'deserved in some star to be a man.' He was\r\nmuch surprised when I disclosed my view of my position and hopes, when\r\nI declared my faith that the feminine side, the side of love, of\r\nbeauty, of holiness, was now to have its full chance, and that, if\r\neither were better, it was better now to be a woman; for even the\r\nslightest achievement of good was furthering an especial work of our\r\ntime. He smiled incredulously. 'She makes the best she can of it,'\r\nthought he. 'Let Jews believe the pride of Jewry, but I am of the\r\nbetter sort, and know better.'\r\n\r\n\"Another used as highest praise, in speaking of a character in\r\nliterature, the words 'a manly woman.'\r\n\r\n\"So in the noble passage of Ben Jonson:\r\n\r\n  'I meant the day-star should not brighter ride,\r\n    Nor shed like influence, from its lucent seat;\r\n  I meant she should be courteous, facile, sweet,\r\n    Free from that solemn vice of greatness, pride;\r\n  I meant each softest virtue there should meet,\r\n    Fit in that softer bosom to abide,\r\n  Only a learned and a _manly_ soul\r\n    I purposed her, that should with even powers\r\n  The rock, the spindle, and the shears control\r\n    Of destiny, and spin her own free hours.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Me thinks,\" said I, \"you are too fastidious in objecting to this.\r\nJonson, in using the word 'manly,' only meant to heighten the picture\r\nof this, the true, the intelligent fate, with one of the deeper\r\ncolors.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said she, \"so invariable is the use of this word where a\r\nheroic quality is to be described, and I feel so sure that persistence\r\nand courage are the most womanly no less than the most manly\r\nqualities, that I would exchange these words for others of a larger\r\nsense, at the risk of marring the fine tissue of the verse. Read, 'A\r\nheavenward and instructed soul,' and I should be satisfied. Let it not\r\nbe said, wherever there is energy or creative genius, 'She has a\r\nmasculine mind.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis by no means argues a willing want of generosity toward Woman. Man\r\nis as generous towards her as he knows how to be.\r\n\r\nWherever she has herself arisen in national or private history, and\r\nnobly shone forth in any form of excellence, men have received her,\r\nnot only willingly, but with triumph. Their encomiums, indeed, are\r\nalways, in some sense, mortifying; they show too much surprise. \"Can\r\nthis be you?\" he cries to the transfigured Cinderella; \"well, I should\r\nnever have thought it, but I am very glad. We will tell every one that\r\nyou have '_surpassed your sex_.'\"\r\n\r\nIn every-day life, the feelings of the many are stained with vanity.\r\nEach wishes to be lord in a little world, to be superior at least over\r\none; and he does not feel strong enough to retain a life-long\r\nascendency over a strong nature. Only a Theseus could conquer before\r\nhe wed the Amazonian queen. Hercules wished rather to rest with\r\nDejanira, and received the poisoned robe as a fit guerdon. The tale\r\nshould be interpreted to all those who seek repose with the weak.\r\n\r\nBut not only is Man vain and fond of power, but the same want of\r\ndevelopment, which thus affects him morally, prevents his\r\nintellectually discerning the destiny of Woman: The boy wants no\r\nwoman, but only a girl to play ball with him, and mark his pocket\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nThus, in Schiller's Dignity of Woman, beautiful as the poem is, there\r\nis no \"grave and perfect man,\" but only a great boy to be softened and\r\nrestrained by the influence of girls. Poets--the elder brothers of\r\ntheir race--have usually seen further; but what can you expect of\r\nevery-day men, if Schiller was not more prophetic as to what women\r\nmust be? Even with Richter, one foremost thought about a wife was that\r\nshe would \"cook him something good.\" But as this is a delicate\r\nsubject, and we are in constant danger of being accused of slighting\r\nwhat are called \"the functions,\" let me say, in behalf of Miranda and\r\nmyself, that we have high respect for those who \"cook something good,\"\r\nwho create and preserve fair order in houses, and prepare therein the\r\nshining raiment for worthy inmates, worthy guests. Only these\r\n\"functions\" must not be a drudgery, or enforced necessity, but a part\r\nof life. Let Ulysses drive the beeves home, while Penelope there piles\r\nup the fragrant loaves; they are both well employed if these be done\r\nin thought and love, willingly. But Penelope is no more meant for a\r\nbaker or weaver solely, than Ulysses for a cattle-herd.\r\n\r\nThe sexes should not only correspond to and appreciate, but prophesy\r\nto one another. In individual instances this happens. Two persons love\r\nin one another the future good which they aid one another to unfold.\r\nThis is imperfectly or rarely done in the general life. Man has gone\r\nbut little way; now he is waiting to see whether Woman can keep step\r\nwith him; but, instead of calling but, like a good brother, \"You can\r\ndo it, if you only think so,\" or impersonally, \"Any one can do what he\r\ntries to do;\" he often discourages with school-boy brag: \"Girls can't\r\ndo that; girls can't play ball.\" But let any one defy their taunts,\r\nbreak through and be brave and secure, they rend the air with shouts.\r\n\r\nThis fluctuation was obvious in a narrative I have lately seen, the\r\nstory of the life of Countess Emily Plater, the heroine of the last\r\nrevolution in Poland. The dignity, the purity, the concentrated\r\nresolve, the calm, deep enthusiasm, which yet could, when occasion\r\ncalled, sparkle up a holy, an indignant fire, make of this young\r\nmaiden the figure I want for my frontispiece. Her portrait is to be\r\nseen in the book, a gentle shadow of her soul. Short was the career.\r\nLike the Maid of Orleans, she only did enough to verify her\r\ncredentials, and then passed from a scene on which she was, probably,\r\na premature apparition.\r\n\r\nWhen the young girl joined the army, where the report of her exploits\r\nhad preceded her, she was received in a manner that marks the usual\r\nstate of feeling. Some of the officers were disappointed at her quiet\r\nmanners; that she had not the air and tone of a stage-heroine. They\r\nthought she could not have acted heroically unless in buskins; had no\r\nidea that such deeds only showed the habit of her mind. Others talked\r\nof the delicacy of her sex, advised her to withdraw from perils and\r\ndangers, and had no comprehension of the feelings within her breast\r\nthat made this impossible. The gentle irony of her reply to these\r\nself-constituted tutors (not one of whom showed himself her equal in\r\nconduct or reason), is as good as her indignant reproof at a later\r\nperiod to the general, whose perfidy ruined all.\r\n\r\nBut though, to the mass of these men, she was an embarrassment and a\r\npuzzle, the nobler sort viewed her with a tender enthusiasm worthy of\r\nher. \"Her name,\" said her biographer, \"is known throughout Europe. I\r\npaint her character that she may be as widely loved.\"\r\n\r\nWith pride, he shows her freedom from all personal affections; that,\r\nthough tender and gentle in an uncommon degree, there was no room for\r\na private love in her consecrated life. She inspired those who knew\r\nher with a simple energy of feeling like her own. \"We have seen,\" they\r\nfelt, \"a woman worthy the name, capable of all sweet affections,\r\ncapable of stern virtue.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a fact worthy of remark, that all these revolutions in favor of\r\nliberty have produced female champions that share the same traits, but\r\nEmily alone has found a biographer. Only a near friend could have\r\nperformed for her this task, for the flower was reared in feminine\r\nseclusion, and the few and simple traits of her history before her\r\nappearance in the field could only have been known to the domestic\r\ncircle. Her biographer has gathered them up with a brotherly devotion.\r\n\r\nNo! Man is not willingly ungenerous. He wants faith and love, because\r\nhe is not yet himself an elevated being. He cries, with sneering\r\nscepticism, \"Give us a sign.\" But if the sign appears, his eyes\r\nglisten, and he offers not merely approval, but homage.\r\n\r\nThe severe nation which taught that the happiness of the race was\r\nforfeited through the fault of a Woman, and showed its thought of what\r\nsort of regard Man owed her, by making him accuse her on the first\r\nquestion to his God,--who gave her to the patriarch as a handmaid,\r\nand, by the Mosaical law, bound her to allegiance like a serf,--even\r\nthey greeted, with solemn rapture, all great and holy women as\r\nheroines, prophetesses, judges in Israel; and, if they made Eve listen\r\nto the serpent, gave Mary as a bride to the Holy Spirit. In other\r\nnations it has been the same down to our day. To the Woman who could\r\nconquer a triumph was awarded. And not only those whose strength was\r\nrecommended to the heart by association with goodness and beauty, but\r\nthose who were bad, if they were steadfast and strong, had their\r\nclaims allowed. In any age a Semiramis, an Elizabeth of England, a\r\nCatharine of Russia, makes her place good, whether in a large or small\r\ncircle. How has a little wit, a little genius, been celebrated in a\r\nWoman! What an intellectual triumph was that of the lonely Aspasia,\r\nand how heartily acknowledged! She, indeed, met a Pericles. But what\r\nannalist, the rudest of men, the most plebeian of husbands, will spare\r\nfrom his page one of the few anecdotes of Roman women--Sappho!\r\nEloisa! The names are of threadbare celebrity. Indeed, they were not\r\nmore suitably met in their own time than the Countess Colonel Plater\r\non her first joining the army. They had much to mourn, and their great\r\nimpulses did not find due scope. But with time enough, space enough,\r\ntheir kindred appear on the scene. Across the ages, forms lean, trying\r\nto touch the hem of their retreating robes. The youth here by my side\r\ncannot be weary of the fragments from the life of Sappho. He will not\r\nbelieve they are not addressed to himself, or that he to whom they\r\nwere addressed could be ungrateful. A recluse of high powers devotes\r\nhimself to understand and explain the thought of Eloisa; he asserts\r\nher vast superiority in soul and genius to her master; he curses the\r\nfate that casts his lot in another age than hers. He could have\r\nunderstood her; he would have been to her a friend, such as Abelard\r\nnever could. And this one Woman he could have loved and reverenced,\r\nand she, alas! lay cold in her grave hundreds of years ago. His sorrow\r\nis truly pathetic. These responses, that come too late to give joy,\r\nare as tragic as anything we know, and yet the tears of later ages\r\nglitter as they fall on Tasso's prison bars. And we know how\r\nelevating to the captive is the security that somewhere an\r\nintelligence must answer to his.\r\n\r\nThe Man habitually most narrow towards Woman will be flushed, as by\r\nthe worst assault on Christianity, if you say it has made no\r\nimprovement in her condition. Indeed, those most opposed to new acts\r\nin her favor, are jealous of the reputation of those which have been\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nWe will not speak of the enthusiasm excited by actresses,\r\nimprovisatrici, female singers,--for here mingles the charm of beauty\r\nand grace,--but female authors, even learned women, if not\r\ninsufferably ugly and slovenly, from the Italian professor's daughter\r\nwho taught behind the curtain, down to Mrs. Carter and Madame Dacier,\r\nare sure of an admiring audience, and, what is far better, chance to\r\nuse what they have learned, and to learn more, if they can once get a\r\nplatform on which to stand.\r\n\r\nBut how to get this platform, or how to make it of reasonably easy\r\naccess, is the difficulty. Plants of great vigor will almost always\r\nstruggle into blossom, despite impediments. But there should be\r\nencouragement, and a free genial atmosphere for those of move timid\r\nsort, fair play for each in its own kind. Some are like the little,\r\ndelicate flowers which love to hide in the dripping mosses, by the\r\nsides of mountain torrents, or in the shade of tall trees. But others\r\nrequire an open field, a rich and loosened soil, or they never show\r\ntheir proper hues.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Man does not have his fair play either; his\r\nenergies are repressed and distorted by the interposition of\r\nartificial obstacles. Ay, but he himself has put them there; they have\r\ngrown out of his own imperfections. If there _is_ a misfortune in\r\nWoman's lot, it is in obstacles being interposed by men, which do\r\n_not_ mark her state; and, if they express her past ignorance, do\r\nnot her present needs. As every Man is of Woman born, she has slow but\r\nsure means of redress; yet the sooner a general justness of thought\r\nmakes smooth the path, the better.\r\n\r\nMan is of Woman born, and her face bends over him in infancy with an\r\nexpression he can never quite forget. Eminent men have delighted to\r\npay tribute to this image, and it is an hackneyed observation, that\r\nmost men of genius boast some remarkable development in the mother.\r\nThe rudest tar brushes off a tear with his coat-sleeve at the hallowed\r\nname. The other day, I met a decrepit old man of seventy, on a\r\njourney, who challenged the stage company to guess where he was going.\r\nThey guessed aright, \"To see your mother.\" \"Yes,\" said he, \"she is\r\nninety-two, but has good eyesight still, they say. I have not seen her\r\nthese forty years, and I thought I could not die in peace without.\" I\r\nshould have liked his picture painted as a companion-piece to that of\r\na boisterous little boy, whom I saw attempt to declaim at a school\r\nexhibition--\r\n\r\n  \"O that those lips had language! Life has passed\r\n  With me but roughly since I heard thee last.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe got but very little way before sudden tears shamed him from the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\nSome gleams of the same expression which shone down upon his infancy,\r\nangelically pure and benign, visit Man again with hopes of pure love,\r\nof a holy marriage. Or, if not before, in the eyes of the mother of\r\nhis child they again are seen, and dim fancies pass before his mind,\r\nthat Woman may not have been born for him alone, but have come from\r\nheaven, a commissioned soul, a messenger of truth and love; that she\r\ncan only make for him a home in which he may lawfully repose, in so\r\nfar as she is\r\n\r\n  \"True to the kindred points of Heaven and home.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn gleams, in dim fancies, this thought visits the mind of common men.\r\nIt is soon obscured by the mists of sensuality, the dust of routine,\r\nand he thinks it was only some meteor or ignis fatuus that shone. But,\r\nas a Rosicrucian lamp, it burns unwearied, though condemned to the\r\nsolitude of tombs; and to its permanent life, as to every truth, each\r\nage has in some form borne witness. For the truths, which visit the\r\nminds of careless men only in fitful gleams, shine with radiant\r\nclearness into those of the poet, the priest, and the artist.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the domestic manners of the ancients, the idea\r\nof Woman was nobly manifested in their mythologies and poems, whore\r\nshe appears as Site in the Ramayana, a form of tender purity; as the\r\nEgyptian Isis, [Footnote: For an adequate description of the Isis, see\r\nAppendix A.] of divine wisdom never yet surpassed. In Egypt, too, the\r\nSphynx, walking the earth with lion tread, looked out upon its marvels\r\nin the calm, inscrutable beauty of a virgin's face, and the Greek\r\ncould only add wings to the great emblem. In Greece, Ceres and\r\nProserpine, significantly termed \"the great goddesses,\" were seen\r\nseated side by side. They needed not to rise for any worshipper or any\r\nchange; they were prepared for all things, as those initiated to their\r\nmysteries knew. More obvious is the meaning of these three forms, the\r\nDiana, Minerva, and Vesta. Unlike in the expression of their beauty,\r\nbut alike in this,--that each was self-sufficing. Other forms were\r\nonly accessories and illustrations, none the complement to one like\r\nthese. Another might, indeed, be the companion, and the Apollo and\r\nDiana set off one another's beauty. Of the Vesta, it is to be\r\nobserved, that not only deep-eyed, deep-discerning Greece, but ruder\r\nRome, who represents the only form of good man (the always busy\r\nwarrior) that could be indifferent to Woman, confided the permanence\r\nof its glory to a tutelary goddess, and her wisest legislator spoke of\r\nmeditation as a nymph.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in Rome the neglect of Woman was a reaction on the manners of\r\nEtruria, where the priestess Queen, warrior Queen, would seem to have\r\nbeen so usual a character.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the noble Roman marriage, where the stern and calm\r\nnobleness of the nation was common to both, we see in the historic\r\npage through the little that is told us of Brutus and Portia.\r\nShakspeare has seized on the relation in its native lineaments,\r\nharmonizing the particular with the universal; and, while it is\r\nconjugal love, and no other, making it unlike the same relation as\r\nseen in Cymbeline, or Othello, even as one star differeth from another\r\nin glory.\r\n\r\n      \"By that great vow\r\n  Which did incorporate and make us one,\r\n  Unfold to me, yourself, your other half,\r\n  Why you are heavy. ...\r\n      Dwell I but in the suburbs\r\n  Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,\r\n  Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMark the sad majesty of his tone in answer. Who would not have lent a\r\nlife-long credence to that voice of honor?\r\n\r\n  \"You are my true and honorable wife;\r\n   As dear to me as are the ruddy drops\r\n   That visit this sad heart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the same voice that tells the moral of his life in the last\r\nwords--\r\n\r\n        \"Countrymen,\r\n  My heart doth joy, that, yet in all my life,\r\n  I found no man but he was true to me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not wonderful that it should be so.\r\n\r\nShakspeare, however, was not content to let Portia rest her plea for\r\nconfidence on the essential nature of the marriage bond:\r\n\r\n  \"I grant I am a woman; but withal,\r\n  A woman that lord Brutus took to wife.\r\n  I grant I am a woman; but withal,\r\n  A woman well reputed--Cato's daughter.\r\n  Think you I am _no stronger than my sex_,\r\n  Being so fathered and so husbanded?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd afterward in the very scene where Brutus is suffering under that\r\n\"insupportable and touching loss,\" the death of his wife, Cassius\r\npleads--\r\n\r\n    \"Have you not love enough to bear with me,\r\n    When that rash humor which my mother gave me\r\n    Makes me forgetful?\r\n\r\n  _Brutus_.--Yes, Cassius, and henceforth,\r\n    When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,\r\n    He'll think your mother chides, and leaves you so.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs indeed it was a frequent belief among the ancients, as with our\r\nIndians, that the _body_ was inherited from the mother, the\r\n_soul_ from the father. As in that noble passage of Ovid, already\r\nquoted, where Jupiter, as his divine synod are looking down on the\r\nfuneral pyre of Hercules, thus triumphs--\r\n\r\n  \"Neo nisi _materna_ Vulcanum parte potentem,\r\n  Sentiet. Aeternum est, a me quod traxit, et expers\r\n  Atque immune neois, nullaque domabile flamma\r\n  Idque ego defunctum terra coelestibus oris\r\n  Accipiam, cunctisque meum laetabile factum\r\n  Dis fore confido.\r\n\r\n  \"The part alone of gross _maternal_ flame\r\n  Fire shall devour; while that from me he drew\r\n  Shall live immortal and its force renew;\r\n  That, when he's dead, I'll raise to realms above;\r\n  Let all the powers the righteous act approve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a god speaking of his union with an earthly Woman, but it\r\nexpresses the common Roman thought as to marriage,--the same which\r\npermitted a man to lend his wife to a friend, as if she were a chattel\r\n\r\n  \"She dwelt but in the suburbs of his good pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYet the same city, as I have said, leaned on the worship of Vesta, the\r\nPreserver, and in later times was devoted to that of Isis. In Sparta,\r\nthought, in this respect as in all others, was expressed in the\r\ncharacters of real life, and the women of Sparta were as much Spartans\r\nas the men. The \"citoyen, citoyenne\" of France was here actualized.\r\nWas not the calm equality they enjoyed as honorable as the devotion of\r\nchivalry? They intelligently shared the ideal life of their nation.\r\n\r\nLike the men they felt:\r\n\r\n    \"Honor gone, all's gone:\r\n  Better never have been born.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were the true friends of men. The Spartan, surely, would not\r\nthink that he received only his body from his mother. The sage, had he\r\nlived in that community, could not have thought the souls of \"vain and\r\nfoppish men will be degraded after death to the forms of women; and,\r\nif they do not then make great efforts to retrieve themselves, will\r\nbecome birds.\"\r\n\r\n(By the way, it is very expressive of the hard intellectuality of the\r\nmerely _mannish_ mind, to speak thus of birds, chosen always by\r\nthe _feminine_ poet as the symbols of his fairest thoughts.)\r\n\r\nWe are told of the Greek nations in general, that Woman occupied there\r\nan infinitely lower place than Man. It is difficult to believe this,\r\nwhen we see such range and dignity of thought on the subject in the\r\nmythologies, and find the poets producing such ideals as Cassandra,\r\nIphigenia, Antigone, Macaria; where Sibylline priestesses told the\r\noracle of the highest god, and he could not be content to reign with\r\na, court of fewer than nine muses. Even Victory wore a female form.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever were the facts of daily life, I cannot complain of the\r\nage and nation which represents its thought by such a symbol as I see\r\nbefore me at this moment. It is a zodiac of the busts of gods and\r\ngoddesses, arranged in pairs. The circle breathes the music of a\r\nheavenly order. Male and female heads are distinct in expression, but\r\nequal in beauty, strength and calmness. Each male head is that of a\r\nbrother and a king,--each female of a sister and a queen. Could the\r\nthought thus expressed be lived out, there would be nothing more to be\r\ndesired. There would be unison in variety, congeniality in difference.\r\n\r\nComing nearer our own time, we find religion and poetry no less true\r\nin their revelations. The rude man, just disengaged from the sod, the\r\nAdam, accuses Woman to his God, and records her disgrace to their\r\nposterity. He is not ashamed to write that he could be drawn from\r\nheaven by one beneath him,--one made, he says, from but a small part\r\nof himself. But in the same nation, educated by time, instructed by a\r\nsuccession of prophets, we find Woman in as high a position as she has\r\never occupied, No figure that has ever arisen to greet our eyes has\r\nbeen received with more fervent reverence than that of the Madonna.\r\nHeine calls her the _Dame du Comptoir_ of the Catholic church,\r\nand this jeer well expresses a serious truth.\r\n\r\nAnd not only this holy and significant image was worshipped by the\r\npilgrim, and the favorite subject of the artist, but it exercised an\r\nimmediate influence on the destiny of the sex. The empresses who\r\nembraced the cross converted sons and husbands. Whole calendars of\r\nfemale saints, heroic dames of chivalry, binding the emblem of faith\r\non the heart of the best-beloved, and wasting the bloom of youth in\r\nseparation and loneliness, for the sake of duties they thought it\r\nreligion to assume, with innumerable forms of poesy, trace their\r\nlineage to this one. Nor, however imperfect may be the action, in our\r\nday, of the faith thus expressed, and though we can scarcely think it\r\nnearer this ideal than that of India or Greece was near their ideal,\r\nis it in vain that the truth has been recognized, that Woman is not\r\nonly a part of Man, bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh, born\r\nthat men might not be lonely--but that women are in themselves\r\npossessors of and possessed by immortal souls. This truth undoubtedly\r\nreceived a greater outward stability from the belief of the church\r\nthat the earthly parent of the Saviour of souls was a woman.\r\n\r\nThe Assumption of the Virgin, as painted by sublime artists, as also\r\nPetrarch's Hymn to the Madonna, [Footnote: Appendix B.] cannot have\r\nspoken to the world wholly without result, yet oftentimes those who\r\nhad ears heard not.\r\n\r\nSee upon the nations the influence of this powerful example. In Spain\r\nlook only at the ballads. Woman in these is \"very Woman;\" she is the\r\nbetrothed, the bride, the spouse of Man; there is on her no hue of the\r\nphilosopher, the heroine, the savante, but she looks great and noble.\r\nWhy? Because she is also, through her deep devotion, the betrothed of\r\nHeaven. Her upturned eyes have drawn down the light that casts a\r\nradiance round her. See only such a ballad as that of \"Lady Teresa's\r\nBridal,\" where the Infanta, given to the Moorish bridegroom, calls\r\ndown the vengeance of Heaven on his unhallowed passion, and thinks it\r\nnot too much to expiate by a life in the cloister the involuntary\r\nstain upon her princely youth. [Footnote: Appendix C.] It was this\r\nconstant sense of claims above those of earthly love or happiness that\r\nmade the Spanish lady who shared this spirit a guerdon to be won by\r\ntoils and blood and constant purity, rather than a chattel to be\r\nbought for pleasure and service.\r\n\r\nGermany did hot need to _learn_ a high view of Woman; it was\r\ninborn in that race. Woman was to the Teuton warrior his priestess,\r\nhis friend, his sister,--in truth, a wife. And the Christian statues\r\nof noble pairs, as they lie above their graves in stone, expressing\r\nthe meaning of all the by-gone pilgrimage by hands folded in mutual\r\nprayer, yield not a nobler sense of the place and powers of Woman than\r\nbelonged to the _altvater_ day. The holy love of Christ which\r\nsummoned them, also, to choose \"the better part--that which could not\r\nbe taken from them,\" refined and hallowed in this nation a native\r\nfaith; thus showing that it was not the warlike spirit alone that left\r\nthe Latins so barbarous in this respect.\r\n\r\nBut the Germans, taking so kindly to this thought, did it the more\r\njustice. The idea of Woman in their literature is expressed both to a\r\ngreater height and depth than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI will give as instances the themes of three ballads:\r\n\r\nOne is upon a knight who had always the name of the Virgin on his\r\nlips. This protected him all his life through, in various and\r\nbeautiful modes, both from sin and other dangers; and, when he died, a\r\nplant sprang from his grave, which so gently whispered the Ave Maria\r\nthat none could pass it by with an unpurified heart.\r\n\r\nAnother is one of the legends of the famous Drachenfels. A maiden, one\r\nof the earliest converts to Christianity, was carried by the enraged\r\npopulace to this dread haunt of \"the dragon's fabled brood,\" to be\r\ntheir prey. She was left alone, but undismayed, for she knew in whom\r\nshe trusted. So, when the dragons came rushing towards her, she showed\r\nthem a crucifix and they crouched reverently at her feet. Next day the\r\npeople came, and, seeing these wonders, were all turned to the faith\r\nwhich exalts the lowly.\r\n\r\nThe third I have in mind is another of the Rhine legends. A youth is\r\nsitting with the maid he loves on the shore of an isle, her fairy\r\nkingdom, then perfumed by the blossoming grape-vines which draped its\r\nbowers. They are happy; all blossoms with them, and life promises its\r\nrichest vine. A boat approaches on the tide; it pauses at their foot.\r\nIt brings, perhaps, some joyous message, fresh dew for their flowers,\r\nfresh light on the wave. No! it is the usual check on such great\r\nhappiness. The father of the count departs for the crusade; will his\r\nson join him, or remain to rule their domain, and wed her he loves?\r\nNeither of the affianced pair hesitates a moment. \"I must go with my\r\nfather,\"--\"Thou must go with thy father.\" It was one thought, one\r\nword. \"I will be here again,\" he said, \"when these blossoms have\r\nturned to purple grapes.\" \"I hope so,\" she sighed, while the prophetic\r\nsense said \"no.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there she waited, and the grapes ripened, and were gathered into\r\nthe vintage, and he came not. Year after year passed thus, and no\r\ntidings; yet still she waited.\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, was in a Moslem prison. Long he languished there\r\nwithout hope, till, at last, his patron saint appeared in vision and\r\nannounced his release, but only on condition of his joining the\r\nmonastic order for the service of the saint.\r\n\r\nAnd so his release was effected, and a safe voyage home given. And\r\nonce more he sets sail upon the Rhine. The maiden, still watching\r\nbeneath the vines, sees at last the object of all this patient love\r\napproach--approach, but not to touch the strand to which she, with\r\noutstretched arms, has rushed. He dares not trust himself to land, but\r\nin low, heart-broken tones, tells her of Heaven's will; and that he,\r\nin obedience to his vow, is now on his way to a convent on the\r\nriver-bank, there to pass the rest of his earthly life in the service\r\nof the shrine. And then he turns his boat, and floats away from her\r\nand hope of any happiness in this world, but urged, as he believes, by\r\nthe breath of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe maiden stands appalled, but she dares not murmur, and cannot\r\nhesitate long. She also bids them prepare her boat. She follows her\r\nlost love to the convent gate, requests an interview with the abbot,\r\nand devotes her Elysian isle, where vines had ripened their ruby fruit\r\nin vain for her, to the service of the monastery where her love was to\r\nserve. Then, passing over to the nunnery opposite, she takes the veil,\r\nand meets her betrothed at the altar; and for a life-long union, if\r\nnot the one they had hoped in earlier years.\r\n\r\nIs not this sorrowful story of a lofty beauty? Does it not show a\r\nsufficiently high view of Woman, of Marriage? This is commonly the\r\nchivalric, still more the German view.\r\n\r\nYet, wherever there was a balance in the mind of Man, of sentiment\r\nwith intellect, such a result was sure. The Greek Xenophon has not\r\nonly painted us a sweet picture of the domestic Woman, in his\r\nEconomics, but in the Cyropedia has given, in the picture of Panthea,\r\na view of Woman which no German picture can surpass, whether lonely\r\nand quiet with veiled lids, the temple of a vestal loveliness, or with\r\neyes flashing, and hair flowing to the free wind, cheering on the hero\r\nto fight for his God, his country, or whatever name his duty might\r\nbear at the time. This picture I shall copy by and by. Yet Xenophon\r\ngrew up in the same age with him who makes Iphigenia say to Achilles,\r\n\r\n  \"Better a thousand women should perish than one man cease to see\r\n   the light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the vulgar Greek sentiment. Xenophon, aiming at the ideal\r\nMan, caught glimpses of the ideal Woman also. From the figure of a\r\nCyrus the Pantheas stand not afar. They do not in thought; they would\r\nnot in life.\r\n\r\nI could swell the catalogue of instances far beyond the reader's\r\npatience. But enough have been brought forward to show that, though\r\nthere has been great disparity betwixt the nations as between\r\nindividuals in their culture on this point, yet the idea of Woman has\r\nalways cast some rays and often been forcibly represented.\r\n\r\nFar less has Woman to complain that she has not had her share of\r\npower. This, in all ranks of society, except the lowest, has been hers\r\nto the extent that vanity would crave, far beyond what wisdom would\r\naccept. In the very lowest, where Man, pressed by poverty, sees in\r\nWoman only the partner of toils and cares, and cannot hope, scarcely\r\nhas an idea of, a comfortable home, he often maltreats her, and is\r\nless influenced by her. In all ranks, those who are gentle and\r\nuncomplaining, too candid to intrigue, too delicate to encroach,\r\nsuffer much. They suffer long, and are kind; verily, they have their\r\nreward. But wherever Man is sufficiently raised above extreme poverty,\r\nor brutal stupidity, to care for the comforts of the fireside, or the\r\nbloom and ornament of life, Woman has always power enough, if she\r\nchoose to exert it, and is usually disposed to do so, in proportion to\r\nher ignorance and childish vanity. Unacquainted with the importance of\r\nlife and its purposes, trained to a selfish coquetry and love of petty\r\npower, she does not look beyond the pleasure of making herself felt at\r\nthe moment, and governments are shaken and commerce broken up to\r\ngratify the pique of a female favorite. The English shopkeeper's wife\r\ndoes not vote, but it is for her interest that the politician\r\ncanvasses by the coarsest flattery. France suffers no woman on her\r\nthrone, but her proud nobles kiss the dust at the feet of Pompadour\r\nand Dubarry; for such flare in the lighted foreground where a Roland\r\nwould modestly aid in the closet. Spain (that same Spain which sang of\r\nXimena and the Lady Teresa) shuts up her women in the care of duennas,\r\nand allows them no book but the breviary; but the ruin follows only\r\nthe more surely from the worthless favorite of a worthless queen.\r\nRelying on mean precautions, men indeed cry peace, peace, where there\r\nis no peace.\r\n\r\nIt is not the transient breath of poetic incense that women want; each\r\ncan receive that from a lover. It is not life-long sway; it needs but\r\nto become a coquette, a shrew, or a good cook, to be sure of that. It\r\nis not money, nor notoriety, nor the badges of authority which men\r\nhave appropriated to themselves. If demands, made in their behalf, lay\r\nstress on any of these particulars, those who make them have not\r\nsearched deeply into the need. The want is for that which at once\r\nincludes these and precludes them; which would not be forbidden power,\r\nlest there be temptation to steal and misuse it; which would not have\r\nthe mind perverted by flattery from a worthiness of esteem; it is for\r\nthat which is the birthright of every being capable of receiving\r\nit,--the freedom, the religious, the intelligent freedom of the\r\nuniverse to use its means, to learn its secret, as far as Nature has\r\nenabled them, with God alone for their guide and their judge.\r\n\r\nYe cannot believe it, men; but the only reason why women over assume\r\nwhat is more appropriate to you, is because you prevent them from\r\nfinding out what is fit for themselves. Were they free, were they wise\r\nfully to develop the strength and beauty of Woman; they would never\r\nwish to be men, or man-like. The well-instructed moon flies not from\r\nher orbit to seize on the glories of her partner. No; for she knows\r\nthat one law rules, one heaven contains, one universe replies to them\r\nalike. It is with women as with the slave:\r\n\r\n  \"Vor dem Sklaven, wenn er die Kette bricht,\r\n   Vor dem frelen Menschen erzittert nicht.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTremble not before the free man, but before the slave who has chains\r\nto break.\r\n\r\nIn slavery, acknowledged slavery, women are on a par with men. Each is\r\na work-tool, an article of property, no more! In perfect freedom, such\r\nas is painted in Olympus, in Swedenborg's angelic state, in the heaven\r\nwhere there is no marrying nor giving in marriage, each is a purified\r\nintelligence, an enfranchised soul,--no less.\r\n\r\n    \"Jene himmlische Gestalten\r\n  Sie fragen nicht nach Mann und Welb,\r\n    Und keine kielder, keine Falten\r\n  Umgeben den verklarten Leib.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe child who song this was a prophetic form, expressive of the\r\nlonging for a state of perfect freedom, pure love. She could not\r\nremain here, but was translated to another air. And it may be that the\r\nair of this earth will never be so tempered that such can bear it\r\nlong. But, while they stay, they must bear testimony to the truth they\r\nare constituted to demand.\r\n\r\nThat an era approaches which shall approximate nearer to such a temper\r\nthan any has yet done, there are many tokens; indeed, so many that\r\nonly a few of the most prominent can here be enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe reigns of Elizabeth of England and Isabella of Castile foreboded\r\nthis era. They expressed the beginning of the new state; while they\r\nforwarded its progress. These were strong characters, and in harmony\r\nwith the wants of their time. One showed that this strength did not\r\nunfit a woman for the duties of a wife and a mother; the other, that\r\nit could enable her to live and die alone, a wide energetic life, a\r\ncourageous death. Elizabeth is certainly no pleasing example. In\r\nrising above the weakness, she did not lay aside the foibles ascribed\r\nto her sex; but her strength must be respected now, as it was in her\r\nown time.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart and Elizabeth seem types, moulded by the spirit of the\r\ntime, and placed upon an elevated platform, to show to the coming ages\r\nWoman such as the conduct and wishes of Man in general is likely to\r\nmake her. The first shows Woman lovely even to allurement; quick in\r\napprehension and weak in judgment; with grace and dignity of\r\nsentiment, but no principle; credulous and indiscreet, yet artful;\r\ncapable of sudden greatness or of crime, but not of a steadfast\r\nwisdom, nor self-restraining virtue. The second reveals Woman\r\nhalf-emancipated and jealous of her freedom, such as she has figured\r\nbefore or since in many a combative attitude, mannish, not equally\r\nmanly; strong and prudent more than great or wise; able to control\r\nvanity, and the wish to rule through coquetry and passion, but not to\r\nresign these dear deceits from the very foundation, as unworthy a\r\nbeing capable of truth and nobleness. Elizabeth, taught by adversity,\r\nput on her virtues as armor, more than produced them in a natural\r\norder from her soul. The time and her position called on her to act\r\nthe wise sovereign, and she was proud that she could do so, but her\r\ntastes and inclinations would have led her to act the weak woman. She\r\nwas without magnanimity of any kind.\r\n\r\nWe may accept as an omen for ourselves that it was Isabella who\r\nfurnished Columbus with the means of coming hither. This land must pay\r\nback its debt to Woman, without whose aid it would not have been\r\nbrought into alliance with the civilized world.\r\n\r\nA graceful and meaning figure is that introduced to us by Mr.\r\nPrescott, in the Conquest of Mexico, in the Indian girl Marina, who\r\naccompanied Cortez, and was his interpreter in all the various\r\ndifficulties of his career. She stood at his side, on the walls of the\r\nbesieged palace, to plead with her enraged countrymen. By her name he\r\nwas known in New Spain, and, after the conquest, her gentle\r\nintercession was often of avail to the conquered. The poem of the\r\nFuture may be read in some features of the story of \"Malinche.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of Elizabeth on literature was real, though, by sympathy\r\nwith its finer productions, she was no more entitled to give name to\r\nan era than Queen Anne. It was simply that the fact of having a female\r\nsovereign on the throne affected the course of a writer's thoughts. In\r\nthis sense, the presence of a woman on the throne always makes its\r\nmark. Life is lived before the eyes of men, by which their\r\nimaginations are stimulated as to the possibilities of Woman. \"We will\r\ndie for our king, Maria, Theresa,\" cry the wild warriors, clashing\r\ntheir swords; and the sounds vibrate through the poems of that\r\ngeneration. The range of female character in Spenser alone might\r\ncontent us for one period. Britomart and Belphoebe have as much room\r\non the canvas as Florimel; and, where this is the case, the haughtiest\r\nAmazon will not murmur that Una should be felt to be the fairest type.\r\n\r\nUnlike as was the English queen to a fairy queen, we may yet conceive\r\nthat it was the image of a queen before the poet's mind that called up\r\nthis splendid court of women. Shakspeare's range is also great; but he\r\nhas left out the heroic characters, such as the Macaria of Greece, the\r\nBritomart of Spenser. Ford and Massinger have, in this respect, soared\r\nto a higher flight of feeling than he. It was the holy and heroic\r\nWoman they most loved, and if they could not paint an Imogen, a\r\nDesdemona, a Rosalind, yet, in those of a stronger mould, they showed\r\na higher ideal, though with so much less poetic power to embody it,\r\nthan we see in Portia or Isabella, the simple truth of Cordelia,\r\nindeed, is of this sort. The beauty of Cordelia is neither male nor\r\nfemale; it is the beauty of virtue.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of love and marriage rose high in the mind of all the\r\nChristian nations who were capable of grave and deep feeling. We may\r\ntake as examples of its English aspect the lines,\r\n\r\n  \"I could not love thee, dear, so much,\r\n     Loved I not honor more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOr the address of the Commonwealth's man to his wife, as she looked\r\nout from the Tower window to see him, for the last time, on his way to\r\nthe scaffold. He stood up in the cart, waved his hat, and cried, \"To\r\nHeaven, my love, to Heaven, and leave you in the storm!\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the love of faith and honor,--a love which stopped, like\r\nColonel Hutchinson's, \"on this side idolatry,\" because it was\r\nreligious. The meeting of two such souls Donne describes as giving\r\nbirth to an \"abler soul.\"\r\n\r\nLord Herbert wrote to his love,\r\n\r\n  \"Were not our souls immortal made,\r\n   Our equal loves can make them such.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the \"Broken Heart,\" of Ford, Penthea, a character which engages my\r\nadmiration even more deeply than the famous one of Calanthe, is made\r\nto present to the mind the most beautiful picture of what these\r\nrelations should be in their purity. Her life cannot sustain the\r\nviolation of what she so clearly feels.\r\n\r\nShakspeare, too, saw that, in true love, as in fire, the utmost ardor\r\nis coincident with the utmost purity. It is a true lover that exclaims\r\nin the agony of Othello,\r\n\r\n  \"If thou art false, O then Heaven mocks Itself!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe son, framed, like Hamlet, to appreciate truth in all the beauty of\r\nrelations, sinks into deep melancholy when he finds his natural\r\nexpectations disappointed. He has no other. She to whom he gave the\r\nname, disgraces from his heart's shrine all the sex.\r\n\r\n  \"Frailty, thy name is Woman.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is because a Hamlet could find cause to say so, that I have put the\r\nline, whose stigma has never been removed, at the head of my work.\r\nBut, as a lover, surely Hamlet would not have so far mistaken, as to\r\nhave finished with such a conviction. He would have felt the faith of\r\nOthello, and that faith could not, in his more dispassionate mind,\r\nhave been disturbed by calumny.\r\n\r\nIn Spain, this thought is arrayed in a sublimity which belongs to the\r\nsombre and passionate genius of the nation. Calderon's Justina resists\r\nall the temptation of the Demon, and raises her lover, with her, above\r\nthe sweet lures of mere temporal happiness. Their marriage is vowed at\r\nthe stake; their goals are liberated together by the martyr flame into\r\n\"a purer state of sensation and existence.\"\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the great poets wove into their lives an ideal love which\r\nanswered to the highest wants. It included those of the intellect and\r\nthe affections, for it was a love of spirit for spirit. It was not\r\nascetic, or superhuman, but, interpreting all things, gave their\r\nproper beauty to details of the common life, the common day. The poet\r\nspoke of his love, not as a flower to place in his bosom, or hold\r\ncarelessly in his hand, but as a light toward which he must find wings\r\nto fly, or \"a stair to heaven.\" He delighted to speak of her, not only\r\nas the bride of his heart, but the mother of his soul; for he saw\r\nthat, in cases where the right direction had been taken, the greater\r\ndelicacy of her frame and stillness of her life left her more open\r\nthan is Man to spiritual influx. So he did not look upon her as\r\nbetwixt him and earth, to serve his temporal needs, but, rather,\r\nbetwixt him and heaven, to purify his affections and lead him to\r\nwisdom through love. He sought, in her, not so much the Eve as the\r\nMadonna.\r\n\r\nIn these minds the thought, which gleams through all the legends of\r\nchivalry, shines in broad intellectual effulgence, not to be\r\nmisinterpreted; and their thought is reverenced by the world, though\r\nit lies far from the practice of the world as yet,--so far that it\r\nseems as though a gulf of death yawned between.\r\n\r\nEven with such men the practice was, often, widely different from the\r\nmental faith. I say mental; for if the heart were thoroughly alive\r\nwith it, the practice could not be dissonant. Lord Herbert's was a\r\nmarriage of convention, made for him at fifteen; he was not\r\ndiscontented with it, but looked only to the advantages it brought of\r\nperpetuating his family on the basis of a great fortune. He paid, in\r\nact, what he considered a dutiful attention to the bond; his thoughts\r\ntravelled elsewhere; and while forming a high ideal of the\r\ncompanionship of minds in marriage, he seems never to have doubted\r\nthat its realization must be postponed to some other state of being.\r\nDante, almost immediately after the death of Beatrice, married a lady\r\nchosen for him by his friends, and Boccaccio, in describing the\r\nmiseries that attended, in this case,\r\n\r\n  \"The form of an union where union is none,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nspeaks as if these were inevitable to the connection, and as if the\r\nscholar and poet, especially, could expect nothing but misery and\r\nobstruction in a domestic partnership with Woman.\r\n\r\nCenturies have passed since, but civilized Europe is still in a\r\ntransition state about marriage; not only in practice but in thought.\r\nIt is idle to speak with contempt of the nations where polygamy is an\r\ninstitution, or seraglios a custom, while practices far more debasing\r\nhaunt, well-nigh fill, every city and every town, and so far as union\r\nof one with one is believed to be the only pure form of marriage, a\r\ngreat majority of societies and individuals are still doubtful whether\r\nthe earthly bond must be a meeting of souls, or only supposes a\r\ncontract of convenience and utility. Were Woman established in the\r\nrights of an immortal being, this could not be. She would not, in some\r\ncountries, be given away by her father, with scarcely more respect for\r\nher feelings than is shown by the Indian chief, who sells his daughter\r\nfor a horse, and beats her if she runs away from her new home. Nor, in\r\nsocieties where her choice is left free, would she be perverted, by\r\nthe current of opinion that seizes her, into the belief that she must\r\nmarry, if it be only to find a protector, and a home of her own.\r\nNeither would Man, if he thought the connection of permanent\r\nimportance, form it so lightly. He would not deem it a trifle, that he\r\nwas to enter into the closest relations with another soul, which, if\r\nnot eternal in themselves, must eternally affect his growth. Neither,\r\ndid he believe Woman capable of friendship, [Footnote: See Appendix D,\r\nSpinoza's view] would he, by rash haste, lose the chance of finding a\r\nfriend in the person who might, probably, live half a century by his\r\nside. Did love, to his mind, stretch forth into infinity, he would not\r\nmiss his chance of its revelations, that he might the sooner rest from\r\nhis weariness by a bright fireside, and secure a sweet and graceful\r\nattendant \"devoted to him alone.\" Were he a step higher, he would not\r\ncarelessly enter into a relation where he might not be able to do the\r\nduty of a friend, as well as a protector from external ill, to the\r\nother party, and have a being in his power pining for sympathy,\r\nintelligence and aid, that he could not give.\r\n\r\nWhat deep communion, what real intercourse is implied in sharing the\r\njoys and cares of parentage, when any degree of equality is admitted\r\nbetween the parties! It is true that, in a majority of instances, the\r\nman looks upon his wife as an adopted child, and places her to the\r\nother children in the relation of nurse or governess, rather than that\r\nof parent. Her influence with them is sure; but she misses the\r\neducation which should enlighten that influence, by being thus\r\ntreated. It is the order of nature that children should complete the\r\neducation, moral and mental, of parents, by making them think what is\r\nneeded for the best culture of human beings, and conquer all faults\r\nand impulses that interfere with their giving this to these dear\r\nobjects, who represent the world to them. Father and mother should\r\nassist one another to learn what is required for this sublime\r\npriesthood of Nature. But, for this, a religious recognition of\r\nequality is required.\r\n\r\nWhere this thought of equality begins to diffuse itself, it is shown\r\nin four ways.\r\n\r\nFirst;--The household partnership. In our country, the woman looks for\r\na \"smart but kind\" husband; the man for a \"capable, sweet-tempered\"\r\nwife. The man furnishes the house; the woman regulates it. Their\r\nrelation is one of mutual esteem, mutual dependence. Their talk is of\r\nbusiness; their affection shows itself by practical kindness. They\r\nknow that life goes more smoothly and cheerfully to each for the\r\nother's aid; they are grateful and content. The wife praises her\r\nhusband as a \"good provider;\" the husband, in return, compliments her\r\nas a \"capital housekeeper.\"   This relation is good so far as it goes.\r\n\r\nNext comes a closer tie, which takes the form either of mutual\r\nidolatry or of intellectual companionship. The first, we suppose, is\r\nto no one a pleasing subject of contemplation. The parties weaken and\r\nnarrow one another; they lock the gate against all the glories of the\r\nuniverse, that they may live in a cell together.  To themselves they\r\nseem the only wise; to all others, steeped in infatuation; the gods\r\nsmile as they look forward to the crisis of cure; to men, the woman\r\nseems an unlovely syren; to women, the man an effeminate boy.\r\n\r\nThe other form, of intellectual companionship, has become more and\r\nmore frequent. Men engaged in public life, literary men, and artists,\r\nhave often found in their wives companions and confidants in thought\r\nno less than in feeling. And, as the intellectual development of Woman\r\nhas spread wider and risen higher, they have, not unfrequently, shared\r\nthe same employment; as in the case of Roland and his wife, who were\r\nfriends in the household and in the nation's councils, read, regulated\r\nhome affairs, or prepared public documents together, indifferently. It\r\nis very pleasant, in letters begun by Roland and finished by his wife,\r\nto see the harmony of mind, and the difference of nature; one thought,\r\nbut various ways of treating it.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best instances of a marriage of friendship.    It\r\nwas only friendship, whose basis was esteem; probably neither party\r\nknew love, except by name.   Roland was a good man, worthy to esteem,\r\nand be esteemed; his wife as deserving of admiration as able to do\r\nwithout it.\r\n\r\nMadame Roland is the fairest specimen we yet have of her class; as\r\nclear to discern her aim, as valiant to pursue it, as Spenser's\r\nBritomart; austerely set apart from all that did not belong to her,\r\nwhether as Woman or as mind. She is an antetype of a class to which\r\nthe coming time will afford a field--the Spartan matron, brought by\r\nthe culture of the age of books to intellectual consciousness and\r\nexpansion. Self-sufficingness, strength, and clearsightedness were, in\r\nher, combined with a power of deep and calm affection. She, too, would\r\nhave given a son or husband the device for his shield, \"Return with it\r\nor upon it;\" and this, not because she loved little, but much. The\r\npage of her life is one of unsullied dignity. Her appeal to posterity\r\nis one against the injustice of those who committed such crimes in the\r\nname of Liberty. She makes it in behalf of herself and her husband. I\r\nwould put beside it, on the shelf, a little volume, containing a\r\nsimilar appeal from the verdict of contemporaries to that of mankind,\r\nmade by Godwin in behalf of his wife, the celebrated, the by most men\r\ndetested, Mary Wolstonecraft. In his view, it was an appeal from the\r\ninjustice of those who did such wrong in the name of virtue. Were this\r\nlittle book interesting for no other cause, it would be so for the\r\ngenerous affection evinced under the peculiar circumstances. This man\r\nhad courage to love and honor this woman in the face of the world's\r\nsentence, and of all that was repulsive in her own past history. He\r\nbelieved he saw of what soul she was, and that the impulses she had\r\nstruggled to act out were noble, though the opinions to which they had\r\nled might not be thoroughly weighed. He loved her, and he defended her\r\nfor the meaning and tendency of her inner life. It was a good fact.\r\n\r\nMary Wolstonecraft, like Madame Dudevant (commonly known as George\r\nSand) in our day, was a woman whose existence better proved the need\r\nof some new interpretation of Woman's Rights than anything she wrote.\r\nSuch beings as these, rich in genius, of most tender sympathies,\r\ncapable of high virtue and a chastened harmony, ought not to find\r\nthemselves, by birth, in a place so narrow, that, in breaking bonds,\r\nthey become outlaws. Were there as much room in the world for such, as\r\nin Spenser's poem for Britomart, they would not run their heads so\r\nwildly against the walls, but prize their shelter rather. They find\r\ntheir way, at last, to light and air, but the world will not take off\r\nthe brand it has set upon them. The champion of the Rights of Woman\r\nfound, in Godwin, one who would plead that cause like a brother. He\r\nwho delineated with such purity of traits the form of Woman in the\r\nMarguerite, of whom the weak St. Leon could never learn to be\r\nworthy,--a pearl indeed whose price was above rubies,--was not false\r\nin life to the faith by which he had hallowed his romance. He acted,\r\nas he wrote, like a brother. This form of appeal rarely fails to touch\r\nthe basest man:--\"Are you acting toward other women in the way you\r\nwould have men act towards your sister?\" George Sand smokes, wears\r\nmale attire, wishes to be addressed as \"Mon frere;\"--perhaps, if she\r\nfound those who were as brothers indeed, she would not care whether\r\nshe were brother or sister. [Footnote: A note appended by my sister in\r\nthis place, in the first edition, is here omitted, because it is\r\nincorporated in another article in this volume, treating of George\r\nSand more at length.--[ED.]] We rejoice to see that she, who expresses\r\nsuch a painful contempt for men in most of her works, as shows she\r\nmust have known great wrong from them, depicts, in \"La Roche Mauprat,\"\r\na man raised by the workings of love from the depths of savage\r\nsensualism to a moral and intellectual life. It was love for a pure\r\nobject, for a steadfast woman, one of those who, the Italian said,\r\ncould make the \"stair to heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThis author, beginning like the many in assault upon bad institutions,\r\nand external ills, yet deepening the experience through comparative\r\nfreedom, sees at last that the only efficient remedy must come from\r\nindividual character. These bad institutions, indeed, it may always be\r\nreplied, prevent individuals from forming good character, therefore we\r\nmust remove them. Agreed; yet keep steadily the higher aim in view.\r\nCould you clear away all the bad forms of society, it is vain, unless\r\nthe individual begin to be ready for better. There must be a parallel\r\nmovement in these two branches of life. And all the rules left by\r\nMoses availed less to further the best life than the living example of\r\none Messiah.\r\n\r\nStill the mind of the age struggles confusedly with these problems,\r\nbetter discerning as yet the ill it can no longer bear, than the good\r\nby which it may supersede it. But women like Sand will speak now and\r\ncannot be silenced; their characters and their eloquence alike\r\nforetell an era when such as they shall easier learn to lead true\r\nlives. But though such forebode, not such shall be parents of it.\r\n[Footnote: Appendix E.] Those who would reform the world must show that\r\nthey do not speak in the heat of wild impulse; their lives must be\r\nunstained by passionate error; they must be severe lawgivers to\r\nthemselves. They must be religious students of the divine purpose with\r\nregard to man, if they would not confound the fancies of a day with\r\nthe requisitions of eternal good. Their liberty must be the liberty of\r\nlaw and knowledge. But as to the transgressions against custom which\r\nhave caused such outcry against those of noble intention, it may be\r\nobserved that the resolve of Eloisa to be only the mistress of\r\nAbelard, was that of one who saw in practice around her the contract\r\nof marriage made the seal of degradation. Shelley feared not to be\r\nfettered, unless so to be was to be false. Wherever abuses are seen,\r\nthe timid will suffer; the bold will protest. But society has a right\r\nto outlaw them till she has revised her law; and this she must be\r\ntaught to do, by one who speaks with authority, not in anger or haste.\r\n\r\nIf Godwin's choice of the calumniated authoress of the \"Rights of\r\nWoman,\" for his honored wife, be a sign of a new era, no less so is an\r\narticle to which I have alluded some pages back, published five or six\r\nyears ago in one of the English Reviews, where the writer, in doing\r\nfall justice to Eloisa, shows his bitter regret that she lives not now\r\nto love him, who might have known bettor how to prize her love than\r\ndid the egotistical Abelard.\r\n\r\nThese marriages, these characters, with all their imperfections,\r\nexpress an onward tendency. They speak of aspiration of soul, of\r\nenergy of mind, seeking clearness and freedom. Of a like promise are\r\nthe tracts lately published by Goodwyn Barmby (the European Pariah, as\r\nhe calls himself) and his wife Catharine. Whatever we may think of\r\ntheir measures, we see in them wedlock; the two minds are wed by the\r\nonly contract that can permanently avail, that of a common faith and a\r\ncommon purpose.\r\n\r\nWe might mention instances, nearer home, of minds, partners in work\r\nand in life, sharing together, on equal terms, public and private\r\ninterests, and which wear not, on any side, the aspect of offence\r\nshown by those last-named: persons who steer straight onward, yet, in\r\nour comparatively free life, have not been obliged to run their heads\r\nagainst any wall. But the principles which guide them might, under\r\npetrified and oppressive institutions, have made them warlike,\r\nparadoxical, and, in some sense, Pariahs. The phenomena are different,\r\nthe law is the same, in all these cases. Men and women have been\r\nobliged to build up their house anew from the very foundation. If they\r\nfound stone ready in the quarry, they took it peaceably; otherwise\r\nthey alarmed the country by pulling down old towers to get materials.\r\n\r\nThese are all instances of marriage as intellectual companionship. The\r\nparties meet mind to mind, and a mutual trust is produced, which can\r\nbuckler them against a million. They work together for a common,\r\npurpose, and, in all these instances, with the same implement,--the\r\npen. The pen and the writing-desk furnish forth as naturally the\r\nretirement of Woman as of Man.\r\n\r\nA pleasing expression, in this kind, is afforded by the union in the\r\nnames of the Howitts. William and Mary Howitt we heard named together\r\nfor years, supposing them to be brother and sister; the equality of\r\nlabors and reputation, even so, was auspicious; more so, now we find\r\nthem man and wife. In his late work on Germany, Howitt mentions his\r\nwife, with pride, as one among the constellation of distinguished\r\nEnglish-women, and in a graceful, simple manner. And still we\r\ncontemplate with pleasure the partnership in literature and affection\r\nbetween the Howitts,--the congenial pursuits and productions--the\r\npedestrian tours wherein the married pair showed that marriage, on a\r\nwide enough basis, does not destroy the \"inexhaustible\" entertainment\r\nwhich lovers find in one another's company.\r\n\r\nIn naming these instances, I do not mean to imply that community of\r\nemployment is essential to the union of husband and wife, more than to\r\nthe union of friends. Harmony exists in difference, no less than in\r\nlikeness, if only the same key-note govern both parts. Woman the poem,\r\nMan the poet! Woman the heart, Man the head! Such divisions are only\r\nimportant when they are never to be transcended. If nature is never\r\nbound down, nor the voice of inspiration stifled, that is enough. We\r\nare pleased that women should write and speak, if they feel need of\r\nit, from having something to tell; but silence for ages would be no\r\nmisfortune, if that silence be from divine command, and not from Man's\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nWhile Goetz Von Berlichingen rides to battle, his wife is busy in the\r\nkitchen; but difference of occupation does not prevent that community\r\nof inward life, that perfect esteem, with which he says,\r\n\r\n  \"Whom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nManzoni thus dedicates his \"Adelchi.\"\r\n\r\n\"To his beloved and venerated wife, Enrichetta Luigia Blondel, who,\r\nwith conjugal affection and maternal wisdom, has preserved a virgin\r\nmind, the author dedicates this 'Adelchi,' grieving that he could not,\r\nby a more splendid and more durable monument, honor the dear name, and\r\nthe memory of so many virtues.\"\r\n\r\nThe relation could not be fairer, nor more equal, if she, too, had\r\nwritten poems. Yet the position of the parties might have been the\r\nreverse as well; the Woman might have sung the deeds, given voice to\r\nthe life of the Man, and beauty would have been the result; as we see,\r\nin pictures of Arcadia, the nymph singing to the shepherds, or the\r\nshepherd, with his pipe, alluring the nymphs; either makes a good\r\npicture. The sounding lyre requires not muscular strength, but energy\r\nof soul to animate the hand which would control it. Nature seems to\r\ndelight in varying the arrangements, as if to show that she will be\r\nfettered by no rule; and we must admit the same varieties that she\r\nadmits.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and highest grade of marriage union is the religious, which\r\nmay be expressed as pilgrimage toward a common shrine. This includes\r\nthe others: home sympathies and household wisdom, for these pilgrims\r\nmust know how to assist each other along the dusty way; intellectual\r\ncommunion, for how sad it would be on such a journey to have a\r\ncompanion to whom you could not communicate your thoughts and\r\naspirations as they sprang to life; who would have no feeling for the\r\nprospects that open, more and more glorious as we advance; who would\r\nnever see the flowers that may be gathered by the most industrious\r\ntraveller! It must include all these.\r\n\r\nSuch a fellow-pilgrim Count Zinzendorf seems to have found in his\r\ncountess, of whom he thus writes:\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-five years' experience has shown me that just the help-meet\r\nwhom I have is the only one that could suit my vocation. Who else\r\ncould have so carried through my family affairs? Who lived so\r\nspotlessly before the world? Who so wisely aided me in my rejection of\r\na dry morality? Who so clearly set aside the Pharisaism which, as\r\nyears passed, threatened to creep in among us? Who so deeply discerned\r\nas to the spirits of delusion which sought to bewilder us? Who would\r\nhave governed my whole economy so wisely, richly and hospitably, when\r\ncircumstances commanded? Who have taken indifferently the part of\r\nservant or mistress, without, on the one side, affecting an especial\r\nspirituality; on the other, being sullied by any worldly pride? Who,\r\nin a community where all ranks are eager to be on a level, would, from\r\nwise and real causes, have known how to maintain inward and outward\r\ndistinctions? Who, without a murmur, have seen her husband encounter\r\nsuch dangers by land and sea? Who undertaken with him, and\r\n_sustained_, such astonishing pilgrimages? Who, amid such\r\ndifficulties, would have always held up her head and supported me? Who\r\nfound such vast sums of money, and acquitted them on her own credit?\r\nAnd, finally, who, of all human beings, could so well understand and\r\ninterpret to others my inner and outer being as this one, of such\r\nnobleness in her way of thinking, such great intellectual capacity,\r\nand so free from the theological perplexities that enveloped me!\"\r\n\r\nLet any one peruse, with all intentness, the lineaments of this\r\nportrait, and see if the husband had not reason, with this air of\r\nsolemn rapture and conviction, to challenge comparison? We are\r\nreminded of the majestic cadence of the line whose feet stop in the\r\njust proportion of Humanity,\r\n\r\n  \"Daughter of God and Mati, accomplished Eve!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAn observer [Footnote: Spangenberg] adds this testimony:\r\n\r\n\"We may, in many marriages, regard it as the best arrangement, if the\r\nman has so much advantage over his wife, that she can, without much\r\nthought of her own, be led and directed by him as by a father. But it\r\nwas not so with the count and his consort. She was not made to be a\r\ncopy; she was an original; and, while she loved and honored him, she\r\nthought for herself, on all subjects, with so much intelligence, that\r\nhe could and did look on her as a sister and friend also.\"\r\n\r\nCompare with this refined specimen of a religiously civilized life the\r\nfollowing imperfect sketch of a North American Indian, and we shall\r\nsee that the same causes will always produce the same results, The\r\nFlying Pigeon (Ratchewaine) was the wife of a barbarous chief, who had\r\nsix others; but she was his only true wife, because the only one of a\r\nstrong and pure character, and, having this, inspired a veneration, as\r\nlike as the mind of the man permitted to that inspired by the Countess\r\nZinzendorf. She died when her son was only four years old, yet left on\r\nhis mind a feeling of reverent love worthy the thought of Christian\r\nchivalry. Grown to manhood, he shed tears on seeing her portrait.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FLYING PIGEON.\r\n\r\n\"Ratchewaine was chaste, mild, gentle in her disposition, kind,\r\ngenerous, and devoted to her husband. A harsh word was never known to\r\nproceed from her mouth; nor was she ever known to be in a passion.\r\nMabaskah used to say of her, after her death, that her hand was shut\r\nwhen those who did not want came into her presence; but when the\r\nreally poor came in, it was like a strainer full of holes, letting all\r\nshe held in it pass through. In the exercise of generous feeling she\r\nwas uniform, It was not indebted for its exercise to whim, nor\r\ncaprice, nor partiality. No matter of what nation the applicant for\r\nher bounty was, or whether at war or peace with her nation; if he were\r\nhungry, she fed him; if naked, she clothed him; and, if houseless, she\r\ngave him shelter. The continued exercise of this generous feeling kept\r\nher poor. And she has been known to give away her last blanket--all\r\nthe honey that was in the lodge, the last bladder of bear's oil, and\r\nthe last piece of dried meat.\r\n\r\n\"She was scrupulously exact in the observance of all the religious\r\nrites which her faith imposed upon her. Her conscience is represented\r\nto have been extremely tender. She often feared that her acts were\r\ndispleasing to the Great Spirit, when she would blacken her face, and\r\nretire to some lone place, and fast and pray.\"\r\n\r\nTo these traits should be added, but for want of room, anecdotes which\r\nshow the quick decision and vivacity of her mind. Her face was in\r\nharmony with this combination. Her brow is as ideal and the eyes and\r\nlids as devout and modest as the Italian picture of the Madonna, while\r\nthe lower part of the face has the simplicity and childish strength of\r\nthe Indian race. Her picture presents the finest specimen of Indian\r\nbeauty we have ever seen. Such a Woman is the sister and friend of all\r\nbeings, as the worthy Man is their brother and helper.\r\n\r\nWith like pleasure we survey the pairs wedded on the eve of missionary\r\neffort They, indeed, are fellow-pilgrims on the well-made road, and\r\nwhether or no they accomplish all they hope for the sad Hindoo, or the\r\nnearer savage, we feel that in the burning waste their love is like to\r\nbe a healing dew, in the forlorn jungle a tent of solace to one\r\nanother. They meet, as children of one Father, to read together one\r\nbook of instruction.\r\n\r\nWe must insert in this connection the most beautiful picture presented\r\nby ancient literature of wedded love under this noble form.\r\n\r\nIt is from the romance in which Xenophon, the chivalrous Greek,\r\npresents his ideal of what human nature should be.\r\n\r\nThe generals of Cyrus had taken captive a princess, a woman of\r\nunequalled beauty, and hastened to present her to the prince as that\r\npart of the spoil he would think most worthy of his acceptance. Cyrus\r\nvisits the lady, and is filled with immediate admiration by the\r\nmodesty and majesty with which she receives him. He finds her name is\r\nPanthea, and that she is the wife of Abradatus, a young king whom she\r\nentirely loves. He protects her as a sister, in his camp, till he can\r\nrestore her to her husband.\r\n\r\nAfter the first transports of joy at this reunion, the heart of\r\nPanthea is bent on showing her love and gratitude to her magnanimous\r\nand delicate protector. And as she has nothing so precious to give as\r\nthe aid of Abradatus, that is what she most wishes to offer. Her\r\nhusband is of one soul with her in this, as in all things.\r\n\r\nThe description of her grief and self-destruction, after the death\r\nwhich ensued upon this devotion, I have seen quoted, but never that of\r\ntheir parting when she sends him forth to battle. I shall copy both.\r\nIf they have been read by any of my readers, they may be so again with\r\nprofit in this connection, for never were the heroism of a true Woman,\r\nand the purity of love in a true marriage, painted in colors more\r\ndelicate and more lively.\r\n\r\n\"The chariot of Abradatus, that had four perches and eight horses, was\r\ncompletely adorned for him; and when he was going to put on his linen\r\ncorslet, which was a sort of armor used by those of his country,\r\nPanthea brought him a golden helmet, and arm-pieces, broad bracelets\r\nfor his wrists, a purple habit that reached down to his feet, and\r\nhung in folds at the bottom, and a crest dyed of a violet color. These\r\nthings she had made, unknown to her husband, and by taking the measure\r\nof his armor. He wondered when he saw them, and inquired thus of\r\nPanthea: 'And have you made me these arms, woman, by destroying your\r\nown ornaments?' 'No, by Jove!' said Panthea, 'not what is the most\r\nvaluable of them; for it is you, if you appear to others to be what I\r\nthink you, that will be my greatest ornament.' And, saying that, she\r\nput on him the armor, and, though she endeavored to conceal it, the\r\ntears poured down her checks. When Abradatus, who was before a man of\r\nfine appearance, was set out in those arms, he appeared the most\r\nbeautiful and noble of all, especially being likewise so by nature.\r\nThen, taking the reins from the driver, he was just preparing to mount\r\nthe chariot, when Panthea, after she had desired all that were there\r\nto retire, thus said:\r\n\r\n\"'O Abradatus! if ever there was a woman who had a greater regard to\r\nher husband than to her own soul, I believe you know that I am such an\r\none; what need I therefore speak of things in particular? for I reckon\r\nthat my actions have convinced you more than any words I can now use.\r\nAnd yet, though I stand thus affected toward you, as you know I do, I\r\nswear, by this friendship of mine and yours, that I certainly would\r\nrather choose to be put under ground jointly with you, approving\r\nyourself a brave man, than to live with you in disgrace and shame; so\r\nmuch do I think you and myself worthy of the noblest things. Then I\r\nthink that we both lie under great obligations to Cyrus, that, when I\r\nwas a captive, and chosen out for himself, he thought fit to treat me\r\nneither as a slave, nor, indeed, as a woman of mean account, but he\r\ntook and kept me for you, as if I were his brother's wife. Besides,\r\nwhen Araspes, who was my guard, went away from him, I promised him,\r\nthat, if he would allow me to send for you, you would come to him, and\r\napprove yourself a much better and move faithful friend than Araspes.'\r\n\r\n\"Thus she spoke; and Abradatus, being struck with admiration at her\r\ndiscourse, laying, his hand gently on her head, and lifting up his\r\neyes to heaven, made this prayer: 'Do thou, O greatest Jove! I grant\r\nme to appear a husband worthy of Panthea, and a friend worthy of\r\nCyrus, who has done us so much honor!'\r\n\r\n\"Having said this, he mounted the chariot by the door of the driver's\r\nseat; and, after he had got up, when the driver shut the door,\r\nPanthea, who had now no other way to salute him, kissed the seat of\r\nthe chariot. The chariot then moved, and she, unknown to him,\r\nfollowed, till Abradatus turning about, and seeing her, said: 'Take\r\ncourage, Panthea! Fare you happily and well, and now go your ways.' On\r\nthis her women and servants carried her to her conveyance, and, laying\r\nher down, concealed her by throwing the covering of a tent over her.\r\nThe people, though Abradatus and his chariot made a noble spectacle,\r\nwere not able to look at him till Panthea was gone.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the battle--\r\n\r\n\"Cyrus calling to some of his servants, 'Tell me, said he, 'has any\r\none seen Abradatus? for I admire that he now does not appear.' One\r\nreplied, 'My sovereign, it is because he is not living, but died in\r\nthe battle as he broke in with his chariot on the Egyptians. All the\r\nrest, except his particular companions, they say, turned off when they\r\nsaw the Egyptians' compact body. His wife is now said to have taken up\r\nhis dead body, to have placed it in the carriage that she herself was\r\nconveyed in, and to have brought it hither to some place on the river\r\nPactolus, and her servants are digging a grave on a certain elevation.\r\nThey say that his wife, after setting him out with all the ornaments\r\nshe has, is sitting on the ground with his head on her knees.' Cyrus,\r\nhearing this, gave himself a blow on the thigh, mounted his horse at a\r\nleap, and, taking with him a thousand horse, rode away to this scene\r\nof affliction; but gave orders to Gadatas and Gobryas to take with\r\nthem all the rich ornaments proper for a friend and an excellent man\r\ndeceased, and to follow after him; and whoever had herds of cattle\r\nwith him, he ordered them to take both oxen, and horses, and sheep in\r\ngood number, and to bring them away to the place where, by inquiry,\r\nthey should find him to be, that he might sacrifice these to\r\nAbradatus.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as he saw the woman sitting on the ground, and the dead body\r\nthere lying, he shed tears at the afflicting sight, and said: 'Alas!\r\nthou brave and faithful soul, hast thou left us, and art thou gone?'\r\nAt the same time he took him by the right hand, and the hand of the\r\ndeceased came away, for it had been cut off with a sword by the\r\nEgyptians.   He, at the sight of this, became yet much more concerned\r\nthan before.    The woman shrieked out in a lamentable manner, and,\r\ntaking the hand from Cyrus, kissed it, fitted it to its proper place\r\nagain, as well as she could, and said: 'The rest, Cyrus, is in the\r\nsame condition, but what need you see it? And I know that I was not\r\none of the least concerned in these his sufferings, and, perhaps, you\r\nwere not less so; for I, fool that I was! frequently exhorted him to\r\nbehave in such a manner as to appear a friend to you, worthy of\r\nnotice; and I know he never thought of what he himself should suffer,\r\nbut of what he should do to please you. He is dead, therefore,' said\r\nshe, 'without reproach, and I, who urged him on, sit here alive.'\r\nCyrus, shedding tears for some time in silence, then spoke:--'He has\r\ndied, woman, the noblest death; for he has died victorious! Do you\r\nadorn him with these things that I furnish you with.'   (Gobryas and\r\nGadatas were then come up, and had brought rich ornaments in great\r\nabundance with them.)   'Then,' said he, 'be assured that he shall not\r\nwant respect and honor in all other things; but, over and above,\r\nmultitudes shall concur in raising him a monument that shall be worthy\r\nof us, and all the sacrifices shall be made him that are proper to be\r\nmade in honor of a brave man.   You shall not be left destitute, but,\r\nfor the sake of your modesty and every other virtue, I will pay you\r\nall other honors, as well as place those about you who will conduct\r\nyou wherever you please. Do you but make it known to me where it is\r\nthat you desire to be conveyed to.' And Panthea replied: 'Be\r\nconfident, Cyrus, I will not conceal from you to whom it is that I\r\ndesire to go.'\r\n\r\n\"He, having said this, went away with great pity for her that she\r\nshould have lost such a husband, and for the man that he should have\r\nleft such a wife behind him, never to see her more. Panthea then gave\r\norders for her servants to retire, 'till such time,' said she, 'as I\r\nshall have lamented my husband as I please.' Her nurse she bid to\r\nstay, and gave orders that, when she was dead, she would wrap her and\r\nher husband up in one mantle together. The nurse, after having\r\nrepeatedly begged her not to do this, and meeting with no success, but\r\nobserving her to grow angry, sat herself down, breaking out into\r\ntears. She, being beforehand provided with a sword, killed herself,\r\nand, laying her head down on her husband's breast, she died. The nurse\r\nset up a lamentable cry, and covered them both, as Panthea had\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\n\"Cyrus, as soon as he was informed of what the woman had done, being\r\nstruck with it, went to help her if he could. The servants, three in\r\nnumber, seeing what had been done, drew their swords and killed\r\nthemselves, as they stood at the place where she bad ordered them. And\r\nthe monument is now said to have been raised by continuing the mound\r\non to the servants; and on a pillar above, they say, the names of the\r\nman and woman were written in Syriac letters.\r\n\r\n\"Below were three pillars, and they were inscribed thus, 'Of the\r\nservants.' Cyrus, when he came to this melancholy scene, was struck\r\nwith admiration of the woman, and, having lamented over her, went\r\naway. He took care, as was proper, that all the funeral rites should\r\nbe paid them in the noblest manner, and the monument, they say, was\r\nraised up to a very great size.\"\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese be the ancients, who, so many assert, had no idea of the dignity\r\nof Woman, or of marriage. Such love Xenophon could paint as subsisting\r\nbetween those who after death \"would see one another never more.\"\r\nThousands of years have passed since, and with the reception of the\r\nCross, the nations assume the belief that those who part thus may meet\r\nagain and forever, if spiritually fitted to one another, as Abradatus\r\nand Panthea were, and yet do we see such marriages among them? If at\r\nall, how often?\r\n\r\nI must quote two more short passages from Xenophon, for he is a writer\r\nwho pleases me well.\r\n\r\nCyrus, receiving the Armenians whom he had conquered--\r\n\r\n\"'Tigranes,' said he, 'at what rate would you purchase the regaining\r\nof your wife?' Now Tigranes happened to be _but lately married_,\r\nand had a very great love for his wife.\" (That clause perhaps sounds\r\n_modern_.)\r\n\r\n\"'Cyrus,' said he, 'I would ransom her at the expense of my life.'\r\n\r\n\"'Take then your own to yourself,' said he. ...\r\n\r\n\"When they came home, one talked of Cyrus' wisdom, another of his\r\npatience and resolution, another of his mildness. One spoke of his\r\nbeauty and smallness of his person, and, on that, Tigranes asked his\r\nwife, 'And do you, Armenian dame, think Cyrus handsome?' 'Truly,' said\r\nshe, 'I did not look at him.' 'At whom, then, _did_ you look?'\r\nsaid Tigranes. 'At him who said that, to save me from servitude, he\r\nwould ransom me at the expense of his own life.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Banquet.--\r\n\r\n\"Socrates, who observed her with pleasure, said, 'This young girl has\r\nconfirmed me in the opinion I have had, for a long time, that the\r\nfemale sex are nothing inferior to ours, excepting only in strength of\r\nbody, or, perhaps, his steadiness of judgment.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Economics, the manner in which the husband gives counsel to his\r\nyoung wife presents the model of politeness and refinement. Xenophon\r\nis thoroughly the gentleman; gentle in breeding and in soul. All the\r\nmen he describes are so, while the shades of manner are distinctly\r\nmarked. There is the serene dignity of Socrates, with gleams of\r\nplayfulness thrown across its cool, religious shades, the princely\r\nmildness of Cyrus, and the more domestic elegance of the husband in\r\nthe Economics.\r\n\r\nThere is no way that men sin more against refinement, as well as\r\ndiscretion, than in their conduct toward their wives. Let them look at\r\nthe men of Xenophon. Such would know how to give counsel, for they\r\nwould know how to receive it. They would feel that the most intimate\r\nrelations claimed most, not least, of refined courtesy. They would not\r\nsuppose that confidence justified carelessness, nor the reality of\r\naffection want of delicacy in the expression of it.\r\n\r\nSuch men would be too wise to hide their affairs from the wife, and\r\nthen expect her to act as if she knew them. They would know that, if\r\nshe is expected to face calamity with courage, she must be instructed\r\nand trusted in prosperity, or, if they had failed in wise confidence,\r\nsuch as the husband shows in the Economics, they would be ashamed of\r\nanger or querulous surprise at the results that naturally follow.\r\n\r\nSuch men would not be exposed to the bad influence of bad wives; for\r\nall wives, bad or good, loved or unloved, inevitably influence their\r\nhusbands, from the power their position not merely gives, but\r\nnecessitates, of coloring evidence and infusing feelings in hours when\r\nthe--patient, shall I call him?--is off his guard. Those who\r\nunderstand the wife's mind, and think it worth while to respect her\r\nsprings of action, know bettor where they are. But to the bad or\r\nthoughtless man, who lives carelessly and irreverently so near another\r\nmind, the wrong he does daily back upon himself recoils. A Cyrus, an\r\nAbradatus, knows where he stands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut to return to the thread of my subject.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of the times is furnished by the triumphs of Female\r\nAuthorship. These have been great, and are constantly increasing.\r\nWomen have taken possession of so many provinces for which men had\r\npronounced them unfit, that, though these still declare there are some\r\ninaccessible to them, it is difficult to say just _where_ they\r\nmust stop.\r\n\r\nThe shining names of famous women have cast light upon the path of the\r\nsex, and many obstructions have been removed. When a Montague could\r\nlearn better than her brother, and use her lore afterwards to such\r\npurpose as an observer, it seemed amiss to hinder women from preparing\r\nthemselves to see, or from seeing all they could, when prepared. Since\r\nSomerville has achieved so much, will any young girl be prevented from\r\nseeking a knowledge of the physical sciences, if she wishes it? De\r\nStael's name was not so clear of offence; she could not forget the\r\nWoman in the thought; while she was instructing you as a mind, she\r\nwished to be admired as a Woman; sentimental tears often dimmed the\r\neagle glance. Her intellect, too, with all its splendor, trained in a\r\ndrawing-room, fed on flattery, was tainted and flawed; yet its beams\r\nmake the obscurest school-house in New England warmer and lighter to\r\nthe little rugged girls who are gathered together on its wooden bench.\r\nThey may never through life hear her name, but she is not the less\r\ntheir benefactress.\r\n\r\nThe influence has been such, that the aim certainly is, now, in\r\narranging school instruction for girls, to give them as fair a field\r\nas boys. As yet, indeed, these arrangements are made with little\r\njudgment or reflection; just as the tutors of Lady Jane Grey, and\r\nother distinguished women of her time, taught them Latin and Greek,\r\nbecause they knew nothing else themselves, so now the improvement in\r\nthe education of girls is to be made by giving them young men as\r\nteachers, who only teach what has been taught themselves at college,\r\nwhile methods and topics need revision for these new subjects, which\r\ncould better be made by those who had experienced the same wants.\r\nWomen are, often, at the head of these institutions; but they have, as\r\nyet, seldom been thinking women, capable of organizing a new whole for\r\nthe wants of the time, and choosing persons to officiate in the\r\ndepartments. And when some portion of instruction of a good sort is\r\ngot from the school, the far greater proportion which is infused from\r\nthe general atmosphere of society contradicts its purport. Yet books\r\nand a little elementary instruction are not furnished in vain. Women\r\nare better aware how great and rich the universe is, not so easily\r\nblinded by narrowness or partial views of a home circle. \"Her mother\r\ndid so before her\" is no longer a sufficient excuse. Indeed, it was\r\nnever received as an excuse to mitigate the severity of censure, but\r\nwas adduced as a reason, rather, why there should be no effort made\r\nfor reformation.\r\n\r\nWhether much or little has been done, or will be done,--whether women\r\nwill add to the talent of narration the power of systematizing,--whether\r\nthey  will carve marble, as well as draw and paint,--is not important.\r\nBut that it should be acknowledged that they have intellect which needs\r\ndeveloping--that they should not be considered complete, if beings of\r\naffection and habit alone--is important.\r\n\r\nYet even this acknowledgment, rather conquered by Woman than proffered\r\nby Man, has been sullied by the usual selfishness. Too much is said of\r\nwomen being better educated, that they may become better companions\r\nand mothers _for_ men. They should be fit for such companionship,\r\nand we have mentioned, with satisfaction, instances where it has been\r\nestablished. Earth knows no fairer, holier relation than that of a\r\nmother. It is one which, rightly understood, must both promote and\r\nrequire the highest attainments. But a being of infinite scope must\r\nnot be treated with an exclusive view to any one relation. Give the\r\nsoul free course, let the organization, both of body and mind, be\r\nfreely developed, and the being will be fit for any and every relation\r\nto which it may be called. The intellect, no more than the sense of\r\nhearing, is to be cultivated merely that Woman may be a more valuable\r\ncompanion to Man, but because the Power who gave a power, by its mere\r\nexistence signifies that it must be brought out toward perfection.\r\n\r\nIn this regard of self-dependence, and a greater simplicity and\r\nfulness of being, we must hail as a preliminary the increase of the\r\nclass contemptuously designated as \"old maids.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot wonder at the aversion with which old bachelors and old\r\nmaids have been regarded. Marriage is the natural means of forming a\r\nsphere, of taking root in the earth; it requires more strength to do\r\nthis without such an opening; very many have failed, and their\r\nimperfections have been in every one's way. They have been more\r\npartial, more harsh, more officious and impertinent, than those\r\ncompelled by severer friction to render themselves endurable. Those\r\nwho have a more full experience of the instincts have a distrust as to\r\nwhether the unmarried can be thoroughly human and humane, such as is\r\nhinted in the saying, \"Old-maids' and bachelors' children are well\r\ncared for,\" which derides at once their ignorance and their\r\npresumption.\r\n\r\nYet the business of society has become so complex, that it could now\r\nscarcely be carried on without the presence of these despised\r\nauxiliaries; and detachments from the army of aunts and uncles are\r\nwanted to stop gaps in every hedge. They rove about, mental and moral\r\nIshmaelites, pitching their tents amid the fixed and ornamented homes\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nIn a striking variety of forms, genius of late, both at home and\r\nabroad, has paid its tribute to the character of the Aunt and the\r\nUncle, recognizing in these personages the spiritual parents, who have\r\nsupplied defects in the treatment of the busy or careless actual\r\nparents.\r\n\r\nThey also gain a wider, if not so deep experience. Those who are not\r\nintimately and permanently linked with others, are thrown upon\r\nthemselves; and, if they do not there find peace and incessant life,\r\nthere is none to flatter them that they are not very poor, and very\r\nmean.\r\n\r\nA position which so constantly admonishes, may be of inestimable\r\nbenefit. The person may gain, undistracted by other relationships, a\r\ncloser communion with the one. Such a use is made of it by saints and\r\nsibyls. Or she may be one of the lay sisters of charity, a canoness,\r\nbound by an inward vow,--or the useful drudge of all men, the Martha,\r\nmuch sought, little prized,--or the intellectual interpreter of the\r\nvaried life she sees; the Urania of a half-formed world's twilight.\r\n\r\nOr she may combine all these. Not needing to care that she may please\r\na husband, a frail and limited being, her thoughts may turn to the\r\ncentre, and she may, by steadfast contemplation entering into the\r\nsecret of truth and love, use it for the good of all men, instead of a\r\nchosen few, and interpret through it all the forms of life. It is\r\npossible, perhaps, to be at once a priestly servant and a loving muse.\r\n\r\nSaints and geniuses have often chosen a lonely position, in the faith\r\nthat if, undisturbed by the pressure of near ties, they would give\r\nthemselves up to the inspiring spirit, it would enable them to\r\nunderstand and reproduce life better than actual experience could.\r\n\r\nHow many \"old maids\" take this high stand we cannot say: it is an\r\nunhappy fact that too many who have come before the eye are gossips\r\nrather, and not always good-natured gossips. But if these abuse, and\r\nnone make the best of their vocation, yet it has not failed to produce\r\nsome good results. It has been seen by others, if not by themselves,\r\nthat beings, likely to be left alone, need to be fortified and\r\nfurnished within themselves; and education and thought have tended\r\nmore and more to regard these beings as related to absolute Being, as\r\nwell as to others. It has been seen that, as the breaking of no bond\r\nought to destroy a man, so ought the missing of none to hinder him\r\nfrom growing. And thus a circumstance of the time, which springs\r\nrather from its luxury than its purity, has helped to place women on\r\nthe true platform.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the next generation, looking deeper into this matter, will\r\nfind that contempt is put upon old maids, or old women, at all, merely\r\nbecause they do not use the elixir which would keep them always young.\r\nUnder its influence, a gem brightens yearly which is only seen to more\r\nadvantage through the fissures Time makes in the casket. [Footnote:\r\nAppendix F.] No one thinks of Michael Angelo's Persican Sibyl, or St.\r\nTheresa, or Tasso's Leonora, or the Greek Electra, as an old maid,\r\nmore than of Michael Angelo or Canova as old bachelors, though all had\r\nreached the period in life's course appointed to take that degree.\r\n\r\nSee a common woman at forty; scarcely has she the remains of beauty,\r\nof any soft poetic grace which gave her attraction as Woman, which\r\nkindled the hearts of those who looked on her to sparkling thoughts,\r\nor diffused round her a roseate air of gentle love. See her, who was,\r\nindeed, a lovely girl, in the coarse, full-blown dahlia flower of what\r\nis commonly matron-beauty, \"fat, fair, and forty,\" showily dressed,\r\nand with manners as broad and full as her frill or satin cloak. People\r\nobserve, \"How well she is preserved!\" \"She is a fine woman still,\"\r\nthey say. This woman, whether as a duchess in diamonds, or one of our\r\ncity dames in mosaics, charms the poet's heart no more, and would look\r\nmuch out of place kneeling before the Madonna. She \"does well the\r\nhonors of her house,\"--\"leads society,\"--is, in short, always spoken\r\nand thought of upholstery-wise.\r\n\r\nOr see that care-worn face, from which every soft line is\r\nblotted,--those faded eyes, from which lonely tears have driven the\r\nflashes of fancy, the mild white beam of a tender enthusiasm. This\r\nwoman is not so ornamental to a tea-party; yet she would please\r\nbetter, in picture. Yet surely she, no more than the other, looks as a\r\nhuman being should at the end of forty years. Forty years! have they\r\nbound those brows with no garland? shed in the lamp no drop of\r\nambrosial oil?\r\n\r\nNot so looked the Iphigenia in Aulis. Her forty years had seen her in\r\nanguish, in sacrifice, in utter loneliness. But those pains were borne\r\nfor her father and her country; the sacrifice she had made pure for\r\nherself and those around her. Wandering alone at night in the vestal\r\nsolitude of her imprisoning grove, she has looked up through its\r\n\"living summits\" to the stars, which shed down into her aspect their\r\nown lofty melody. At forty she would not misbecome the marble.\r\n\r\nNot so looks the Persica. She is withered; she is faded; the drapery\r\nthat enfolds her has in its dignity an angularity, too, that tells of\r\nage, of sorrow, of a stern resignation to the _must_. But her\r\neye, that torch of the soul, is untamed, and, in the intensity of her\r\nreading, we see a soul invincibly young in faith and hope. Her age is\r\nher charm, for it is the night of the past that gives this beacon-fire\r\nleave to shine. Wither more and more, black Chrysalid! thou dost but\r\ngive the winged beauty time to mature its splendors!\r\n\r\nNot so looked Victoria Colonna, after her life of a great hope, and of\r\ntrue conjugal fidelity. She had been, not merely a bride, but a wife,\r\nand each hour had helped to plume the noble bird. A coronet of pearls\r\nwill not shame her brow; it is white and ample, a worthy altar for\r\nlove and thought.\r\n\r\nEven among the North American Indians, a race of men as completely\r\nengaged in mere instinctive life as almost any in the world, and where\r\neach chief, keeping many wives as useful servants, of course looks\r\nwith no kind eye on celibacy in Woman, it was excused in the following\r\ninstance mentioned by Mrs. Jameson. A woman dreamt in youth that she\r\nwas betrothed to the Sun. She built her a wigwam apart, filled it with\r\nemblems of her alliance, and means of on independent life. There she\r\npassed her days, sustained by her own exertions, and true to her\r\nsupposed engagement.\r\n\r\nIn any tribe, we believe, a woman, who lived as if she was betrothed\r\nto the Sun, would be tolerated, and the rays which made her youth\r\nblossom sweetly, would crown her with a halo in age.\r\n\r\nThere is, on this subject, a nobler view than heretofore, if not the\r\nnoblest, and improvement here must coincide with that in the view\r\ntaken of marriage. \"We must have units before we can have union,\" says\r\none of the ripe thinkers of the times.\r\n\r\nIf larger intellectual resources begin to be deemed needful to Woman,\r\nstill more is a spiritual dignity in her, or even the mere assumption\r\nof it, looked upon with respect. Joanna Southcote and Mother Anne Lee\r\nare sure of a band of disciples; Ecstatica, Dolorosa, of enraptured\r\nbelievers who will visit them in their lowly huts, and wait for days\r\nto revere them in their trances. The foreign noble traverses land and\r\nsea to hear a few words from the lips of the lowly peasant girl, whom\r\nhe believes especially visited by the Most High. Very beautiful, in\r\nthis way, was the influence of the invalid of St. Petersburg, as\r\ndescribed by De Maistre.\r\n\r\nMysticism, which may be defined as the brooding soul of the world,\r\ncannot fail of its oracular promise as to Woman. \"The mothers,\" \"The\r\nmother of all things,\" are expressions of thought which lead the mind\r\ntowards this side of universal growth. Whenever a mystical whisper was\r\nheard, from Behmen down to St. Simon, sprang up the thought, that, if\r\nit be true, as the legend says, that Humanity withers through a fault\r\ncommitted by and a curse laid upon Woman, through her pure child, or\r\ninfluence, shall the new Adam, the redemption, arise. Innocence is to\r\nbe replaced by virtue, dependence by a willing submission, in the\r\nheart of the Virgin-Mother of the new race.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual tendency is toward the elevation of Woman, but the\r\nintellectual by itself is not so. Plato sometimes seems penetrated by\r\nthat high idea of love, which considers Man and Woman as the two-fold\r\nexpression of one thought. This the angel of Swedenborg, the angel of\r\nthe coming age, cannot surpass, but only explain more fully. But then\r\nagain Plato, the man of intellect, treats Woman in the Republic as\r\nproperty, and, in the Timaeus, says that Man, if he misuse the\r\nprivileges of one life, shall be degraded into the form of Woman; and\r\nthen, if ho do not redeem himself, into that of a bird. This, as I\r\nsaid above, expresses most happily how antipoetical is this state of\r\nmind. For the poet, contemplating the world of things, selects various\r\nbirds as the symbols of his most gracious and ethereal thoughts, just\r\nas he calls upon his genius as muse rather than as God. But the\r\nintellect, cold, is ever more masculine than feminine; warmed by\r\nemotion, it rushes toward mother-earth, and puts on the forms of\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nThe electrical, the magnetic element in Woman has not been fairly\r\nbrought out at any period. Everything might be expected from it; she\r\nhas far more of it than Man. This is commonly expressed by saying that\r\nher intuitions are more rapid and more correct. You will often see men\r\nof high intellect absolutely stupid in regard to the atmospheric\r\nchanges, the fine invisible links which connect the forms of life\r\naround them, while common women, if pure and modest, so that a vulgar\r\nself do not overshadow the mental eye, will seize and delineate these\r\nwith unerring discrimination.\r\n\r\nWomen who combine this organization with creative genius are very\r\ncommonly unhappy at present. They see too much to act in conformity\r\nwith those around them, and their quick impulses seem folly to those\r\nwho do not discern the motives. This is an usual effect of the\r\napparition of genius, whether in Man or Woman, but is more frequent\r\nwith regard to the latter, because a harmony, an obvious order and\r\nself-restraining decorum, is most expected from her.\r\n\r\nThen women of genius, even more than men, are likely to be enslaved by\r\nan impassioned sensibility. The world repels them more rudely, and\r\nthey are of weaker bodily frame.\r\n\r\nThose who seem overladen with electricity frighten those around them.\r\n\"When she merely enters the room, I am what the French call\r\n_herisse_,\" said a man of petty feelings and worldly character of\r\nsuch a woman, whose depth of eye and powerful motion announced the\r\nconductor of the mysterious fluid.\r\n\r\nWoe to such a woman who finds herself linked to such a man in bonds\r\ntoo close! It is the crudest of errors. He will detest her with all\r\nthe bitterness of wounded self-love. He will take the whole prejudice\r\nof manhood upon himself, and, to the utmost of his power, imprison and\r\ntorture her by its imperious rigors.\r\n\r\nYet, allow room enough, and the electric fluid will be found to\r\ninvigorate and embellish, not destroy life. Such women are the great\r\nactresses, the songsters. Such traits we read in a late searching,\r\nthough too French, analysis of the character of Mademoiselle Rachel,\r\nby a modern, La Rochefeucault. The Greeks thus represent the muses;\r\nthey have not the golden serenity of Apollo; they are overflowed with\r\nthought; there is something tragic in their air. Such are the Sibyls\r\nof Gueroino; the eye is overfull of expression, dilated and lustrous;\r\nit seems to have drawn the whole being into it.\r\n\r\nSickness is the frequent result of this overcharged existence. To this\r\nregion, however misunderstood, or interpreted with presumptuous\r\ncarelessness, belong the phenomena of magnetism, or mesmerism, as it\r\nis now often called, where the trance of the Ecstatica purports to be\r\nproduced by the agency of one human being on another, instead of, as\r\nin her case, direct from the spirit.\r\n\r\nThe worldling has his sneer at this as at the services of religion.\r\n\"The churches can always be filled with women\"--\"Show me a man in one\r\nof your magnetic states, and I will believe.\"\r\n\r\nWomen are, indeed, the easy victims both of priestcraft and\r\nself-delusion; but this would not be, if the intellect was developed\r\nin proportion to the other powers. They would then have a regulator,\r\nand be more in equipoise, yet must retain the same nervous\r\nsusceptibility while their physical structure is such as it is.\r\n\r\nIt is with just that hope that we welcome everything that tends to\r\nstrengthen the fibre and develop the nature on more sides. When the\r\nintellect and affections are in harmony; when intellectual\r\nconsciousness is calm and deep; inspiration will not be confounded\r\nwith fancy.\r\n\r\n  Then, \"she who advances\r\n    With rapturous, lyrical glances,\r\n  Singing the song of the earth, singing\r\n    Its hymn to the Gods,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwill not be pitied as a mad-woman, nor shrunk from as unnatural.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks, who saw everything in forms, which we are trying to\r\nascertain as law, and classify as cause, embodied all this in the form\r\nof Cassandra. Cassandra was only unfortunate in receiving her gift too\r\nsoon. The remarks, however, that the world still makes in such cases,\r\nare well expressed by the Greek dramatist.\r\n\r\nIn the Trojan dames there are fine touches of nature with regard to\r\nCassandra. Hecuba shows that mixture of shame and reverence that\r\nprosaic kindred always do toward the inspired child, the poet, the\r\nelected sufferer for the race.\r\n\r\nWhen the herald announces that Cassandra is chosen to be the mistress\r\nof Agamemnon, Hecuba answers, with indignation, betraying the pride\r\nand faith she involuntarily felt in this daughter.\r\n\r\n  \"_Hec_. The maiden of Phoebus, to whom the golden-haired\r\n       Gave as a privilege a virgin life!\r\n\r\n  _Tal_. Love of the inspired maiden hath pierced him.\r\n\r\n  _Hec_. Then cast away, my child, the sacred keys, and from thy person\r\n       The consecrated garlands which thou wearest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, when, a moment after, Cassandra appears, singing, wildly, her\r\ninspired song, Hecuba calls her, \"My _frantic_ child.\"\r\n\r\nYet how graceful she is in her tragic _raptus_, the chorus shows.\r\n\r\n  \"_Chorus_. How sweetly at thy house's ills thou smil'st,\r\n         Chanting what, haply, thou wilt not show true.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Hecuba dares not trust her highest instinct about her daughter,\r\nstill less can the vulgar mind of the herald Talthybius, a man not\r\nwithout feeling, but with no princely, no poetic blood, abide the\r\nwild, prophetic mood which insults all his prejudices.\r\n\r\n  \"_Tal_. The venerable, and that accounted wise,\r\n      Is nothing better than that of no repute;\r\n      For the greatest king of all the Greeks,\r\n      The dear son of Atreus, a possessed with the love\r\n      Of this mad-Woman. I, indeed, am poor;\r\n      Yet I would not receive her to my bed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal Agamemnon could see the beauty of Cassandra; _he_ was\r\nnot afraid of her prophetic gifts.\r\n\r\nThe best topic for a chapter on this subject, in the present day,\r\nwould be the history of the Seeress of Prevorst, the best observed\r\nsubject of magnetism in our present times, and who, like her\r\nancestresses of Delphos, was roused to ecstasy or phrensy by the touch\r\nof the laurel.\r\n\r\nI observe in her case, and in one known to me here, that what might\r\nhave been a gradual and gentle disclosure of remarkable powers was\r\nbroken and jarred into disease by an unsuitable marriage. Both these\r\npersons were unfortunate in not understanding what was involved in\r\nthis relation, but acted ignorantly, as their friends desired. They\r\nthought that this was the inevitable destiny of Woman. But when\r\nengaged in the false position, it was impossible for them to endure\r\nits dissonances, as those of less delicate perceptions can; and the\r\nfine flow of life was checked and sullied. They grew sick; but, even\r\nso, learned and disclosed more than those in health are wont to do.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, worldlings sneer; but reverent men learn wondrous news,\r\neither from the person observed, or by thoughts caused in themselves\r\nby the observation. Fenelon learns from Guyon, Kerner from his\r\nSeeress, what we fain would know. But to appreciate such disclosures\r\none must be a child; and here the phrase, \"women and children,\" may,\r\nperhaps, be interpreted aright, that only little children shall enter\r\ninto the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\nAll these motions of the time, tides that betoken a waxing moon,\r\noverflow upon our land. The world at large is readier to let Woman\r\nlearn and manifest the capacities of her nature than it ever was\r\nbefore, and here is a less encumbered field and freer air than\r\nanywhere else. And it ought to be so; we ought to pay for Isabella's\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nThe names of nations are feminine--Religion, Virtue and Victory are\r\nfeminine. To those who have a superstition, as to outward reigns, it\r\nis not without significance that the name of the queen of our\r\nmotherland should at this crisis be Victoria,--Victoria the First.\r\nPerhaps to us it may be given to disclose the era thus outwardly\r\npresaged.\r\n\r\nAnother Isabella too at this time ascends the throne. Might she open a\r\nnew world to her sex! But, probably, these poor little women are,\r\nleast of any, educated to serve as examples or inspirers for the rest.\r\nThe Spanish queen is younger; we know of her that she sprained her\r\nfoot the other day, dancing in her private apartments; of Victoria,\r\nthat she reads aloud, in a distinct voice and agreeable manner, her\r\naddresses to Parliament on certain solemn days, and, yearly, that she\r\npresents to the nation some new prop of royalty. These ladies have,\r\nvery likely, been trained more completely to the puppet life than any\r\nother. The queens, who have been queens indeed, were trained by\r\nadverse circumstances to know the world around them and their own\r\npowers.\r\n\r\nIt is moving, while amusing, to read of the Scottish peasant measuring\r\nthe print left by the queen's foot as she walks, and priding himself\r\non its beauty. It is so natural to wish to find what is fair and\r\nprecious in high places,--so astonishing to find the Bourbon a\r\nglutton, or the Guelph a dullard or gossip.\r\n\r\nIn our own country, women are, in many respects, better situated than\r\nmen. Good books are allowed, with more time to read them. They are not\r\nso early forced into the bustle of life, nor so weighed down by\r\ndemands for outward success. The perpetual changes, incident to our\r\nsociety, make the blood circulate freely through the body politic,\r\nand, if not favorable at present to the grace and bloom of life, they\r\nare so to activity, resource, and would be to reflection, but for a\r\nlow materialist tendency, from which the women are generally exempt in\r\nthemselves, though its existence, among the men, has a tendency to\r\nrepress their impulses and make them doubt their instincts, thus often\r\nparalyzing their action during the best years.\r\n\r\nBut they have time to think, and no traditions chain them, and few\r\nconventionalities, compared with what must be met in other nations.\r\nThere is no reason why they should not discover that the secrets of\r\nnature are open, the revelations of the spirit waiting, for whoever\r\nwill seek them. When the mind is once awakened to this consciousness,\r\nit will not be restrained by the habits of the past, but fly to seek\r\nthe seeds of a heavenly future.\r\n\r\nTheir employments are more favorable to meditation than those of men.\r\n\r\nWoman is not addressed religiously here more than elsewhere. She is\r\ntold that she should be worthy to be the mother of a Washington, or\r\nthe companion of some good man.' But in many, many instances, she has\r\nalready learned that all bribes have the same flaw; that truth and\r\ngood are to be sought solely for their own sakes. And, already, an\r\nideal sweetness floats over many forms, shines in many eyes.\r\n\r\nAlready deep questions are put by young girls on the great theme: What\r\nshall I do to enter upon the eternal life?\r\n\r\nMen are very courteous to them. They praise them often, check them\r\nseldom. There is chivalry in the feeling toward \"the ladies,\" which\r\ngives them the best seats in the stage-coach, frequent admission, not\r\nonly to lectures of all sorts, but to courts of justice, halls of\r\nlegislature, reform conventions. The newspaper editor \"would be better\r\npleased that the Lady's Book should be filled up exclusively by\r\nladies. It would then, indeed, be a true gem, worthy, to be presented\r\nby young men to the, mistress of their affections.\" Can gallantry go\r\nfurther?\r\n\r\nIn this country is venerated, wherever seen, the character which\r\nGoethe spoke of as an Ideal, which he saw actualized in his friend and\r\npatroness, the Grand Duchess Amelia: \"The excellent woman is she, who,\r\nif the husband dies, can be a father to the children.\" And this, if\r\nread aright, tells a great deal.\r\n\r\nWomen who speak in public, if they have a moral power, such as has\r\nbeen felt from Angelina Grimke and Abby Kelly,--that is, if they speak\r\nfor conscience' sake, to serve a cause which they hold sacred,--invariably\r\nsubdue the prejudices of their hearers, and excite an interest\r\nproportionate to the aversion with which it had been the purpose to\r\nregard them.\r\n\r\nA passage in a private letter so happily illustrates this, that it\r\nmust be inserted here.\r\n\r\nAbby Kelly in the Town-House of ----.\r\n\r\n\"The scene was not unheroic--to see that woman, true to humanity and\r\nher own nature, a centre of rude eyes and tongues, even gentlemen\r\nfeeling licensed to make part of a species of mob around a female out\r\nof her sphere. As she took her seat in the desk amid the great noise,\r\nand in the throng, full, like a wave, of something to ensue, I saw her\r\nhumanity in a gentleness and unpretension, tenderly open to the sphere\r\naround her, and, had she not been supported by the power of the will\r\nof genuineness and principle, she would have failed. It led her to\r\nprayer, which, in Woman especially, is childlike; sensibility and will\r\ngoing to the side of God and looking up to him; and humanity was\r\npoured out in aspiration.\r\n\r\n\"She acted like a gentle hero, with her mild decision and womanly\r\ncalmness. All heroism is mild, and quiet, and gentle, for it is life\r\nand possession; and combativeness and firmness show a want of\r\nactualness. She is as earnest, fresh and simple, as when she first\r\nentered the crusade. I think she did much good, more than the men in\r\nher place could do, for Woman feels more as being and reproducing--this\r\nbrings the subject more into home relations. Men speak through, and\r\nmostly from intellect, and this addresses itself to that in others\r\nwhich is combative.\"\r\n\r\nNot easily shall we find elsewhere, or before this time, any written\r\nobservations on the same subject, so delicate and profound.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Channing, whose enlarged and tender and religious nature\r\nshared every onward impulse of his tune, though his thoughts followed\r\nhis wishes with a deliberative caution which belonged to his habits\r\nand temperament, was greatly interested in these expectations for\r\nwomen. His own treatment of them was absolutely and thoroughly\r\nreligious. He regarded them as souls, each of which had a destiny of\r\nits own, incalculable to other minds, and whose leading it must\r\nfollow, guided by the light of a private conscience. He had sentiment,\r\ndelicacy, kindness, taste; but they were all pervaded and ruled by\r\nthis one thought, that all beings had souls, and must vindicate their\r\nown inheritance. Thus all beings were treated by him with an equal,\r\nand sweet, though solemn, courtesy. The young and unknown, the woman\r\nand the child, all felt themselves regarded with an infinite\r\nexpectation, from which there was no reaction to vulgar prejudice. He\r\ndemanded of all he met, to use his favorite phrase, \"great truths.\"\r\n\r\nHis memory, every way dear and reverend, is, by many, especially\r\ncherished for this intercourse of unbroken respect.\r\n\r\nAt one time, when the progress of Harriet Martineau through this\r\ncountry, Angelina Grimke's appearance in public, and the visit of Mrs.\r\nJameson, had turned his thoughts to this subject, he expressed high\r\nhopes as to what the coming era would bring to Woman. He had been much\r\npleased with the dignified courage of Mrs. Jameson in taking up the\r\ndefence of her sex in from which women usually shrink, because, if\r\nthey express themselves on such subjects with sufficient force and\r\nclearness to do any good, they are exposed to assaults whose vulgarity\r\nmakes them painful. In intercourse with such a woman, he had shared\r\nher indignation at the base injustice, in many respects, and in many\r\nregions, done to the sex; and been led to think of it far more than\r\never before. He seemed to think that he might some time write upon the\r\nsubject. That his aid is withdrawn from the cause is a subject of\r\ngreat regret; for, on this question as on others, he would have known\r\nhow to sum up the evidence, and take, in the noblest spirit, middle\r\nground. He always furnished a platform on which opposing parties could\r\nstand and look at one another under the influence of his mildness and\r\nenlightened candor.\r\n\r\nTwo younger thinkers, men both, have uttered noble prophecies,\r\nauspicious for Woman. Kinmont, all whose thoughts tended towards the\r\nestablishment of the reign of love and peace, thought that the\r\ninevitable means of this would be an increased predominance given to\r\nthe idea of Woman. Had he lived longer, to see the growth of the Peace\r\nParty, the reforms in life and medical practice which seek to\r\nsubstitute water for wine and drugs, pulse for animal food, he would\r\nhave been confirmed in his view of the way in which the desired\r\nchanges are to be effected.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I must mention Shelley, who, like all men of\r\ngenius, shared the feminine development, and, unlike many, knew it.\r\nHis life was one of the first pulse-beats in the present\r\nreform-growth. He, too, abhorred blood and heat, and, by his system\r\nand his song, tended to reinstate a plant-like gentleness in the\r\ndevelopment of energy. In harmony with this, his ideas of marriage\r\nwere lofty, and, of course, no less so of Woman, her nature, and\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nFor Woman, if, by a sympathy as to outward condition, she is led to\r\naid the enfranchisement of the slave, must be no less so, by inward\r\ntendency, to favor measures which promise to bring the world more\r\nthoroughly and deeply into harmony with her nature. When the lamb\r\ntakes place of the lion as the emblem of nations, both women and men\r\nwill be as children of one spirit, perpetual learners of the word and\r\ndoers thereof, not hearers only.\r\n\r\nA writer in the New York Pathfinder, in two articles headed\r\n\"Femality,\" has uttered a still more pregnant word than any we have\r\nnamed. He views Woman truly from the soul, and not from society, and\r\nthe depth and leading of his thoughts are proportionably remarkable.\r\nHe views the feminine nature as a harmonizer of the vehement elements,\r\nand this has often been hinted elsewhere; but what he expresses most\r\nforcibly is the lyrical, the inspiring and inspired apprehensiveness\r\nof her being.\r\n\r\nThis view being identical with what I have before attempted to\r\nindicate, as to her superior susceptibility to magnetic or electric\r\ninfluence, I will now try to express myself more fully.\r\n\r\nThere are two aspects of Woman's nature, represented by the ancients\r\nas Muse and Minerva. It is the former to which the writer in the\r\nPathfinder looks. It is the latter which Wordsworth has in mind, when\r\nhe says,\r\n\r\n                      \"With a placid brow,\r\n  Which woman ne'er should forfeit, keep thy vow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe especial genius of Woman I believe to be electrical in movement,\r\nintuitive in function, spiritual in tendency. She excels not so easily\r\nin classification, or recreation, as in an instinctive seizure of\r\ncauses, and a simple breathing out of what she receives, that has the\r\nsingleness of life, rather than the selecting and energizing of art.\r\n\r\nMore native is it to her to be the living model of the artist than to\r\nset apart from herself any one form in objective reality; more native\r\nto inspire and receive the poem, than to create it. In so far as soul\r\nis in her completely developed, all soul is the same, but in so far as\r\nit is modified in her as Woman, it flows, it breathes, it sings,\r\nrather than deposits soil, or finishes work; and that which is\r\nespecially feminine flushes, in blossom, the face of earth, and\r\npervades, like air and water, all this seeming solid globe, daily\r\nrenewing and purifying its life. Such may be the especially feminine\r\nelement spoken of as Femality. But it is no more the order of nature\r\nthat it should be incarnated pure in any form, than that the masculine\r\nenergy should exist unmingled with it in any form.\r\n\r\nMale and female represent the two sides of the great radical dualism.\r\nBut, in fact, they are perpetually passing into one another. Fluid\r\nhardens to solid, solid rushes to fluid. There is no wholly masculine\r\nman, no purely feminine woman.\r\n\r\nHistory jeers at the attempts of physiologists to bind great original\r\nlaws by the forms which flow from them. They make a rule; they say\r\nfrom observation what can and cannot be. In vain! Nature provides\r\nexceptions to every rule. She sends women to battle, and sets Hercules\r\nspinning; she enables women to bear immense burdens, cold, and frost;\r\nshe enables the man, who feels maternal love, to nourish his infant\r\nlike a mother. Of late she plays still gayer pranks. Not only she\r\ndeprives organizations, but organs, of a necessary end. She enables\r\npeople to read with the top of the head, and see with the pit of the\r\nstomach. Presently she will make a female Newton, and a male Syren.\r\n\r\nMan partakes of the feminine in the Apollo, Woman of the masculine as\r\nMinerva.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by the Muse is that unimpeded clearness of the intuitive\r\npowers, which a perfectly truthful adherence to every admonition of\r\nthe higher instincts would bring to a finely organized human being. It\r\nmay appear as prophecy or as poesy. It enabled Cassandra to foresee\r\nthe results of actions passing round her; the Seeress to behold the\r\ntrue character of the person through the mask of his customary life.\r\n(Sometimes she saw a feminine form behind the man, sometimes the\r\nreverse.) It enabled the daughter of Linnaeus to see the soul of the\r\nflower exhaling from the flower. [Footnote: The daughter of Linnaeus\r\nstates, that, while looking steadfastly at the red lily, she saw its\r\nspirit hovering above it, as a red flame. It is true, this, like many\r\nfair spirit-stories, may be explained away as an optical illusion, but\r\nits poetic beauty and meaning would, even then, make it valuable, as\r\nan illustration of the spiritual fact.] It gave a man, but a poet-man,\r\nthe power of which he thus speaks: \"Often in my contemplation of\r\nnature, radiant intimations, and as it were sheaves of light, appear\r\nbefore me as to the facts of cosmogony, in which my mind has, perhaps,\r\ntaken especial part.\" He wisely adds, \"but it is necessary with\r\nearnestness to verify the knowledge we gain by these flashes of\r\nlight.\" And none should forget this. Sight must be verified by light\r\nbefore it can deserve the honors of piety and genius. Yet sight comes\r\nfirst, and of this sight of the world of causes, this approximation to\r\nthe region of primitive motions, women I hold to be especially\r\ncapable. Even without equal freedom with the other sex, they have\r\nalready shown themselves so; and should these faculties have free\r\nplay, I believe they will open new, deeper and purer sources of joyous\r\ninspiration than have as yet refreshed the earth.\r\n\r\nLet us be wise, and not impede the soul. Let her work as she will. Let\r\nus have one creative energy, one incessant revelation. Let it take\r\nwhat form it will, and let us not bind it by the past to man or woman,\r\nblack or white. Jove sprang from Rhea, Pallas from Jove. So let it be.\r\n\r\nIf it has been the tendency of these remarks to call Woman rather to\r\nthe Minerva side,--if I, unlike the more generous writer, have spoken\r\nfrom society no less than the soul,--let it be pardoned! It is love\r\nthat has caused this,--love for many incarcerated souls, that might be\r\nfreed, could the idea of religious self-dependence be established in\r\nthem, could the weakening habit of dependence on others be broken up.\r\n\r\nProclus teaches that every life has, in its sphere, a totality or\r\nwholeness of the animating powers of the other spheres; having only,\r\nas its own characteristic, a predominance of some one power. Thus\r\nJupiter comprises, within himself, the other twelve powers, which\r\nstand thus: The first triad is _demiurgic or fabricative_, that\r\nis, Jupiter, Neptune, Vulcan; the second, _defensive_, Vesta,\r\nMinerva, Mars; the third, _vivific_, Ceres, Juno, Diana; and the\r\nfourth, Mercury, Venus, Apollo, _elevating and harmonic_. In the\r\nsphere of Jupiter, energy is predominant--with Venus, beauty; but each\r\ncomprehends and apprehends all the others.\r\n\r\nWhen the same community of life and consciousness of mind begin among\r\nmen, humanity will have, positively and finally, subjugated its brute\r\nelements and Titanic childhood; criticism will have perished;\r\narbitrary limits and ignorant censure be impossible; all will have\r\nentered upon the liberty of law, and the harmony of common growth.\r\n\r\nThen Apollo will sing to his lyre what Vulcan forges on the anvil, and\r\nthe Muse weave anew the tapestries of Minerva.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, only in the present crisis that the preference is\r\ngiven to Minerva. The power of continence must establish the\r\nlegitimacy of freedom, the power of self-poise the perfection of\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nEvery relation, every gradation of nature is incalculably precious,\r\nbut only to the soul which is poised upon itself, and to whom no loss,\r\nno change, can bring dull discord, for it is in harmony with the\r\ncentral soul.\r\n\r\nIf any individual live too much in relations, so that he becomes a\r\nstranger to the resources of his own nature, he falls, after a while,\r\ninto a distraction, or imbecility, from which he can only be cured by\r\na time of isolation, which gives the renovating fountains time to rise\r\nup. With a society it is the same. Many minds, deprived of the\r\ntraditionary or instinctive means of passing a cheerful existence,\r\nmust find help in self-impulse, or perish. It is therefore that, while\r\nany elevation, in the view of union, is to be hailed with joy, we\r\nshall not decline celibacy as the great fact of the time. It is one\r\nfrom which no vow, no arrangement, can at present save a thinking\r\nmind. For now the rowers are pausing on their oars; they wait a change\r\nbefore they can pull together. All tends to illustrate the thought of\r\na wise cotemporary. Union is only possible to those who are units. To\r\nbe fit for relations in time, souls, whether of Man or Woman, must be\r\nable to do without them in the spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore that I would have Woman lay aside all thought, such as\r\nshe habitually cherishes, of being taught and led by men. I would have\r\nher, like the Indian girl, dedicate herself to the Sun, the Sun of\r\nTruth, and go nowhere if his beams did not make clear the path. I\r\nwould have her free from compromise, from complaisance, from\r\nhelplessness, because I would have her good enough and strong enough\r\nto love one and all beings, from the fulness, not the poverty of\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nMen, as at present instructed, will not help this work, because they\r\nalso are under the slavery of habit. I have seen with delight their\r\npoetic impulses. A sister is the fairest ideal, and how nobly\r\nWordsworth, and even Byron, have written of a sister!\r\n\r\nThere is no sweeter sight than to see a father with his little\r\ndaughter. Very vulgar men become refined to the eye when leading a\r\nlittle girl by the hand. At that moment, the right relation between\r\nthe sexes seems established, and you feel as if the man would aid in\r\nthe noblest purpose, if you ask him in behalf of his little daughter.\r\nOnce, two fine figures stood before me, thus. The father of very\r\nintellectual aspect, his falcon eye softened by affection as he looked\r\ndown on his fair child; she the image of himself, only more graceful\r\nand brilliant in expression. I was reminded of Southey's Kehama; when,\r\nlo, the dream was rudely broken! They were talking of education, and\r\nhe said,\r\n\r\n\"I shall not have Maria brought too forward. If she knows too much,\r\nshe will never find a husband; superior women hardly ever can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said his wife, with a blush, \"you wish Maria to be as good\r\nand wise as she can, whether it will help her to marriage or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he persisted, \"I want her to have a sphere and a home, and some\r\none to protect her when I am gone.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a trifling incident, but made a deep impression. I felt that\r\nthe holiest relations fail to instruct the unprepared and perverted\r\nmind. If this man, indeed, could have looked at it on the other side,\r\nhe was the last that would have been willing to have been taken\r\nhimself for the home and protection he could give, but would have been\r\nmuch more likely to repeat the tale of Alcibiades with his phials.\r\n\r\nBut men do _not_ look at both sides, and women must leave off\r\nasking them and being influenced by them, but retire within\r\nthemselves, and explore the ground-work of life till they find their\r\npeculiar secret. Then, when they come forth again, renovated and\r\nbaptized, they will know how to turn all dross to gold, and will be\r\nrich and free though they live in a hut, tranquil if in a crowd. Then\r\ntheir sweet singing shall not be from passionate impulse, but the\r\nlyrical overflow of a divine rapture, and a new music shall be evolved\r\nfrom this many-chorded world.\r\n\r\nGrant her, then, for a while, the armor and the javelin. Let her put\r\nfrom her the press of other minds, and meditate in virgin loneliness.\r\nThe same idea shall reappear in due time as Muse, or Ceres, the\r\nall-kindly, patient Earth-Spirit.\r\n\r\nAmong the throng of symptoms which denote the present tendency to a\r\ncrisis in the life of Woman,--which resembles the change from\r\ngirlhood, with its beautiful instincts, but unharmonized thoughts, its\r\nblind pupilage and restless seeking, to self-possessed, wise and\r\ngraceful womanhood,--I have attempted to select a few.\r\n\r\nOne of prominent interest is the unison upon the subject of three male\r\nminds, which, for width of culture, power of self-concentration and\r\ndignity of aim, take rank as the prophets of the coming age, while\r\ntheir histories and labors are rooted in the past.\r\n\r\nSwedenborg came, he tells us, to interpret the past revelation and\r\nunfold a new. He announces the New Church that is to prepare the way\r\nfor the New Jerusalem, a city built of precious stones, hardened and\r\npurified by secret processes in the veins of earth through the ages.\r\n\r\nSwedenborg approximated to that harmony between the scientific and\r\npoetic lives of mind, which we hope from the perfected man. The links\r\nthat bind together the realms of nature, the mysteries that accompany\r\nher births and growths, were unusually plain to him. He seems a man to\r\nwhom insight was given at a period when the mental frame was\r\nsufficiently matured to retain and express its gifts.\r\n\r\nHis views of Woman are, in the main, satisfactory. In some details we\r\nmy object to them, as, in all his system, there are still remains of\r\nwhat is arbitrary and seemingly groundless--fancies that show the\r\nmarks of old habits, and a nature as yet not thoroughly leavened with\r\nthe spiritual leaven. At least, so it seems to me now. I speak\r\nreverently, for I find such reason to venerate Swedenborg, from an\r\nimperfect knowledge of his mind, that I feel one more perfect might\r\nexplain to me much that does not now secure my sympathy.\r\n\r\nHis idea of Woman is sufficiently large and noble to interpose no\r\nobstacle to her progress. His idea of marriage is consequently\r\nsufficient. Man and Woman share an angelic ministry; the union is of\r\none with one, permanent and pure.\r\n\r\nAs the New Church extends its ranks, the needs of Woman must be more\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nQuakerism also establishes Woman on a sufficient equality with Man.\r\nBut, though the original thought of Quakerism is pure, its scope is\r\ntoo narrow, and its influence, having established a certain amount of\r\ngood and made clear some truth, must, by degrees, be merged in one of\r\nwider range. [Footnote: In worship at stated periods, in daily\r\nexpression, whether by word or deed, the Quakers have placed Woman on\r\nthe same platform with Man. Can any one assert that they have reason\r\nto repent this?] The mind of Swedenborg appeals to the various nature\r\nof Man, and allows room for aesthetic culture and the free expression\r\nof energy.\r\n\r\nAs apostle of the new order, of the social fabric that is to rise from\r\nlove, and supersede the old that was based on strife, Charles Fourier\r\ncomes next, expressing, in an outward order, many facts of which\r\nSwedenborg saw the secret springs. The mind of Fourier, though grand\r\nand clear, was, in some respects, superficial. He was a stranger to\r\nthe highest experiences. His eye was fixed on the outward more than\r\nthe inward needs of Man. Yet he, too, was a seer of the divine order,\r\nin its musical expression, if not in its poetic soul. He has filled\r\none department of instruction for the new era, and the harmony in\r\naction, and freedom for individual growth, he hopes, shall exist; and,\r\nif the methods he proposes should not prove the true ones, yet his\r\nfair propositions shall give many hints, and make room for the\r\ninspiration needed for such.\r\n\r\nHe, too, places Woman on an entire equality with Man, and wishes to\r\ngive to one as to the other that independence which must result from\r\nintellectual and practical development.\r\n\r\nThose who will consult him for no other reason, might do so to see how\r\nthe energies of Woman may be made available in the pecuniary way. The\r\nobject of Fourier was to give her the needed means of self-help, that\r\nshe might dignify and unfold her life for her own happiness, and that\r\nof society. The many, now, who see their daughters liable to\r\ndestitution, or vice to escape from it, may be interested to examine\r\nthe means, if they have not yet soul enough to appreciate the ends he\r\nproposes.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the advancing army leads the great apostle of\r\nindividual culture, Goethe. Swedenborg makes organization and union\r\nthe necessary results of solitary thought. Fourier, whose nature was,\r\nabove all, constructive, looked to them too exclusively. Better\r\ninstitutions, he thought, will make better men. Goethe expressed, in\r\nevery way, the other side. If one man could present better forms, the\r\nrest could not use them till ripe for them.\r\n\r\nFourier says, As the institutions, so the men! All follies are\r\nexcusable and natural under bad institutions.\r\n\r\nGoethe thinks, As the man, so the institutions! There is no excuse for\r\nignorance and folly. A man can grow in any place, if he will.\r\n\r\nAy! but, Goethe, bad institutions are prison-walls and impure air,\r\nthat make him stupid, so that he does not will.\r\n\r\nAnd thou, Fourier, do not expect to change mankind at once, or even\r\n\"in three generations,\" by arrangement of groups and series, or\r\nflourish of trumpets for attractive industry. If these attempts are\r\nmade by unready men, they will fail.\r\n\r\nYet we prize the theory of Fourier no less than the profound\r\nsuggestion of Goethe. Both are educating the age to a clearer\r\nconsciousness of what Man needs, what Man can be; and better life must\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nGoethe, proceeding on his own track, elevating the human being, in the\r\nmost imperfect states of society, by continual efforts at\r\nself-culture, takes as good care of women as of men. His mother, the\r\nbold, gay Frau Aja, with such playful freedom of nature; the wise and\r\ngentle maiden, known in his youth, over whose sickly solitude \"the\r\nHoly Ghost brooded as a dove;\" his sister, the intellectual woman\r\n_par excellence_; the Duchess Amelia; Lili, who combined the\r\ncharacter of the woman of the world with the lyrical sweetness of the\r\nshepherdess, on whose chaste and noble breast flowers and gems were\r\nequally at home; all these had supplied abundant suggestions to his\r\nmind, as to the wants and the possible excellences of Woman. And from\r\nhis poetic soul grew up forms new and more admirable than life has yet\r\nproduced, for whom his clear eye marked out paths in the future.\r\n\r\nIn Faust Margaret represents the redeeming power, which, at present,\r\nupholds Woman, while waiting for a better day. The lovely little girl,\r\npure in instinct, ignorant in mind, is misled and profaned by man\r\nabusing her confidence.[Footnote: As Faust says, her only fault was a\r\n\"kindly delusion,\"--\"ein guter wahn.\"] To the Mater _Dolorosa_\r\nshe appeals for aid. It is given to the soul, if not against outward\r\nsorrow; and the maiden, enlightened by her sufferings, refusing to\r\nreceive temporal salvation by the aid of an evil power, obtains the\r\neternal in its stead.\r\n\r\nIn the second part, the intellectual man, after all his manifold\r\nstrivings, owes to the interposition of her whom he had betrayed\r\n_his_ salvation. She intercedes, this time, herself a glorified\r\nspirit, with the Mater _Gloriosa_.\r\n\r\nLeonora, too, is Woman, as we see her now, pure, thoughtful, refined\r\nby much acquaintance with grief.\r\n\r\nIphigenia he speaks of in his journals as his \"daughter,\" and she is\r\nthe daughter [Footnote: Goethe was as false to his ideas, in practice,\r\nas Lord Herbert. And his punishment was the just and usual one of\r\nconnections formed beneath the standard of right, from the impulses of\r\nthe baser self. Iphigenia was the worthy daughter of his mind; but the\r\nson, child of his degrading connection in actual life, corresponded\r\nwith that connection. This son, on whom Goethe vainly lavished so much\r\nthought and care, was like his mother, and like Goethe's attachment\r\nfor his mother. \"This young man,\" says a late well-informed writer (M.\r\nHenri Blaze), \"Wieland, with good reason, called the son of the\r\nservant, _der Sohn der Magd_. He inherited from his father only\r\nhis name and his _physique_.\"] whom a man will wish, even if he\r\nhas chosen his wife from very mean motives. She is the virgin,\r\nsteadfast, soul, to whom falsehood is more dreadful than any other\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nBut it is to Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship and Wandering Years that\r\nI would especially refer, as these volumes contain the sum of the\r\nSage's observations during a long life, as to what Man should do,\r\nunder present circumstances, to obtain mastery over outward, through\r\nan initiation into inward life, and severe discipline of faculty.\r\n\r\nAs Wilhelm advances into the upward path, he becomes acquainted with\r\nbetter forms of Woman, by knowing how to seek, and how to prize them\r\nwhen found. For the weak and immature man will, often, admire a\r\nsuperior woman, but he will not be able to abide by a feeling which is\r\ntoo severe a tax on his habitual existence. But, with Wilhelm, the\r\ngradation is natural, and expresses ascent in the scale of being. At\r\nfirst, he finds charm in Mariana and Philina, very common forms of\r\nfeminine character, not without redeeming traits, no less than charms,\r\nbut without wisdom or purity. Soon he is attended by Mignon, the\r\nfinest expression ever yet given to what I have called the lyrical\r\nelement in Woman. She is a child, but too full-grown for this man; he\r\nloves, but cannot follow her; yet is the association not without an\r\nenduring influence. Poesy has been domesticated in his life; and,\r\nthough he strives to bind down her heavenward impulse, as art or\r\napothegm, these are only the tents, beneath which he may sojourn for a\r\nwhile, but which may be easily struck, and carried on limitless\r\nwanderings.\r\n\r\nAdvancing into the region of thought, he encounters a wise\r\nphilanthropy in Natalia (instructed, let us observe, by an\r\n_uncle_); practical judgment and the outward economy of life in\r\nTheresa; pure devotion in the Fair Saint.\r\n\r\nFurther, and last, he comes to the house of Macaria, the soul of a\r\nstar; that is, a pure and perfected intelligence embodied in feminine\r\nform, and the centre of a world whose members revolve harmoniously\r\naround her. She instructs him in the archives of a rich human history,\r\nand introduces him to the contemplation of the heavens.\r\n\r\nFrom the hours passed by the side of Mariana to these with Macaria, is\r\na wide distance for human feet to traverse. Nor has Wilhelm travelled\r\nso far, seen and suffered so much, in vain, He now begins to study how\r\nhe may aid the next generation; he sees objects in harmonious\r\narrangement, and from his observations deduces precepts by which to\r\nguide his course as a teacher and a master, \"help-full, comfort-full.\"\r\n\r\nIn all these expressions of Woman, the aim of Goethe is satisfactory\r\nto me. He aims at a pure self-subsistence, and a free development of\r\nany powers with which they may be gifted by nature as much for them as\r\nfor men. They are units, addressed as souls. Accordingly, the meeting\r\nbetween Man and Woman, as represented by him, is equal and noble; and,\r\nif he does not depict marriage, he makes it possible.\r\n\r\nIn the Macaria, bound with the heavenly bodies in fixed revolutions,\r\nthe centre of all relations, herself unrelated, he expresses the\r\nMinerva side of feminine nature. It was not by chance that Goethe gave\r\nher this name. Macaria, the daughter of Hercules, who offered herself\r\nas a victim for the good of her country, was canonized by the Greeks,\r\nand worshipped as the Goddess of true Felicity. Goethe has embodied\r\nthis Felicity as the Serenity that arises from Wisdom, a Wisdom such\r\nas the Jewish wise man venerated, alike instructed in the designs of\r\nheaven, and the methods necessary to carry them into effect upon\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nMignon is the electrical, inspired, lyrical nature.  And wherever it\r\nappears we echo in our aspirations that of the child,\r\n\r\n  \"So let me seem until I be:--\r\n   Take not the _white robe_ away.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Though I lived without care and toil,\r\n   Yet felt I sharp pain enough to\r\n   Make me again forever young.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these women, though we see them in relations, we can think of as\r\nunrelated. They all are very individual, yet seem nowhere restrained.\r\nThey satisfy for the present, yet arouse an infinite expectation.\r\n\r\nThe economist Theresa, the benevolent Natalia, the fair Saint, have\r\nchosen a path, but their thoughts are not narrowed to it. The\r\nfunctions of life to them are not ends, but suggestions.\r\n\r\nThus, to them, all things are important, because none is necessary.\r\nTheir different characters have fair play, and each is beautiful in\r\nits minute indications, for nothing is enforced or conventional; but\r\neverything, however slight, grows from the essential life of the\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nMignon and Theresa wear male attire when they like, and it is graceful\r\nfor them to do so, while Macaria is confined to her arm-chair behind\r\nthe green curtain, and the Fair Saint could not bear a speck of dust\r\non her robe.\r\n\r\nAll things are in their places in this little world, because all is\r\nnatural and free, just as \"there is room for everything out of doors.\"\r\nYet all is rounded in by natural harmony, which will always arise\r\nwhere Truth and Love are sought in the light of Freedom.\r\n\r\nGoethe's book bodes an era of freedom like its own of \"extraordinary,\r\ngenerous seeking,\" and new revelations. New individualities shall be\r\ndeveloped in the actual world, which shall advance upon it as gently\r\nas the figures come out upon his canvas.\r\n\r\nI have indicated on this point the coincidence between his hopes and\r\nthose of Fourier, though his are directed by an infinitely higher and\r\ndeeper knowledge of human nature. But, for our present purpose, it is\r\nsufficient to show how surely these different paths have conducted to\r\nthe same end two earnest thinkers. In some other place I wish to point\r\nout similar coincidences between Goethe's model school and the plans\r\nof Fourier, which may cast light upon the page of prophecy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMany women have observed that the time drew nigh for a better care of\r\nthe sex, and have thrown out hints that may be useful. Among these may\r\nbe mentioned--\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth, who, although restrained by the habits of her age and\r\ncountry, and belonging more to the eighteenth than the nineteenth\r\ncentury, has done excellently as far as she goes. She had a horror of\r\nsentimentalism, and of the love of notoriety, and saw how likely\r\nwomen, in the early stages of culture, were to aim at these. Therefore\r\nshe bent her efforts to recommending domestic life. But the methods\r\nshe recommends are such as will fit a character for any position to\r\nwhich it may be called. She taught a contempt of falsehood, no less in\r\nits most graceful, than in its meanest apparitions; the cultivation of\r\na clear, independent judgment, and adherence to its dictates; habits\r\nof various and liberal study and employment, and a capacity for\r\nfriendship. Her standard of character is the same for both sexes,--Truth,\r\nhonor, enlightened benevolence, and aspiration after knowledge.\r\nOf poetry, she knows nothing, and her religion consists in honor and\r\nloyalty to obligations once assumed--in short, in \"the great idea of\r\nduty which holds us upright.\" Her whole tendency is practical.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jameson is a sentimentalist, and, therefore, suits us ill in some\r\nrespects, but she is full of talent, has a just and refined perception\r\nof the beautiful, and a genuine courage when she finds it necessary.\r\nShe does not appear to have thought out, thoroughly, the subject on\r\nwhich we are engaged, and her opinions, expressed as opinions, are\r\nsometimes inconsistent with one another. But from the refined\r\nperception of character, admirable suggestions are given in her \"Women\r\nof Shakspeare,\" and \"Loves of the Poets.\"\r\n\r\nBut that for which I most respect her is the decision with which she\r\nspeaks on a subject which refined women are usually afraid to\r\napproach, for fear of the insult and scurrile jest they may\r\nencounter; but on which she neither can nor will restrain the\r\nindignation of a full heart. I refer to the degradation of a large\r\nportion of women into the sold and polluted slaves of men, and the\r\ndaring with which the legislator and man of the world lifts his head\r\nbeneath the heavens, and says, \"This must be; it cannot be helped; it\r\nis a necessary accompaniment of _civilization_.\"\r\n\r\nSo speaks the _citizen_. Man born of Woman, the father of\r\ndaughters, declares that he will and must buy the comforts and\r\ncommercial advantages of his London, Vienna, Paris, New York, by\r\nconniving at the moral death, the damnation, so far as the action of\r\nsociety can insure it, of thousands of women for each splendid\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nO men! I speak not to you. It is true that your wickedness (for you\r\nmust not deny that at least nine thousand out of the ten fall through\r\nthe vanity you have systematically flattered, or the promises you have\r\ntreacherously broken); yes, it is true that your wickedness is its own\r\npunishment. Your forms degraded and your eyes clouded by secret sin;\r\nnatural harmony broken and fineness of perception destroyed in your\r\nmental and bodily organization; God and love shut out from your hearts\r\nby the foul visitants you have permitted there; incapable of pure\r\nmarriage; incapable of pure parentage; incapable of worship; O\r\nwretched men, your sin is its own punishment! You have lost the world\r\nin losing yourselves. Who ruins another has admitted the worm to the\r\nroot of his own tree, and the fuller ye fill the cup of evil, the\r\ndeeper must be your own bitter draught. But I speak not to you--you\r\nneed to teach and warn one another. And more than one voice rises in\r\nearnestness. And all that _women_ say to the heart that has once\r\nchosen the evil path is considered prudery, or ignorance, or perhaps a\r\nfeebleness of nature which exempts from similar temptations.\r\n\r\nBut to you, women, American women, a few words may not be addressed in\r\nvain. One here and there may listen.\r\n\r\nYou know how it was in the Oriental clime, One man, if wealth\r\npermitted, had several wives and many handmaidens. The chastity and\r\nequality of genuine marriage, with \"the thousand decencies that flow\"\r\nfrom its communion, the precious virtues that gradually may be matured\r\nwithin its enclosure, were unknown.\r\n\r\nBut this man did not wrong according to his light. What he did, he\r\nmight publish to God and Man; it was not a wicked secret that hid in\r\nvile lurking-places and dens, like the banquets of beasts of prey.\r\nThose women were not lost, not polluted in their own eyes, nor those\r\nof others. If they were not in a state of knowledge and virtue, they\r\nwere at least in one of comparative innocence.\r\n\r\nYou know how it was with the natives of this continent. A chief had\r\nmany wives, whom he maintained and who did his household work; those\r\nwomen were but servants, still they enjoyed the respect of others and\r\ntheir own. They lived together, in peace. They knew that a sin against\r\nwhat was in their nation esteemed virtue, would be as strictly\r\npunished in Man as in Woman.\r\n\r\nNow pass to the countries where marriage is between one and one. I\r\nwill not speak of the Pagan nations, but come to those which own the\r\nChristian rule. We all know what that enjoins; there is a standard to\r\nappeal to.\r\n\r\nSee, now, not the mass of the people, for we all know that it is a\r\nproverb and a bitter jest to speak of the \"down-trodden million.\"  We\r\nknow that, down to our own time, a principle never had so fair a\r\nchance to pervade the mass of the people, but that we must solicit its\r\nillustration from select examples.\r\n\r\nTake the Paladin, take the Poet. Did _they_ believe purity more\r\nimpossible to Man than to Woman? Did they wish Woman to believe that\r\nMan was less amenable to higher motives,--that pure aspirations would\r\nnot guard him against bad passions,--that honorable employments and\r\ntemperate habits would not keep him free from slavery to the body? O\r\nno! Love was to them a part of heaven, and they could not even wish to\r\nreceive its happiness, unless assured of being worthy of it. Its\r\nhighest happiness to them was that it made them wish to be worthy.\r\nThey courted probation. They wished not the title of knight till the\r\nbanner had been upheld in the heats of battle, amid the rout of\r\ncowards.\r\n\r\nI ask of you, young girls--I do not mean _you_ whose heart is\r\nthat of an old coxcomb, though your looks have not yet lost their\r\nsunny tinge. Not of you whose whole character is tainted with vanity,\r\ninherited or taught, who have early learned the love of coquettish\r\nexcitement, and whose eyes rove restlessly in search of a \"conquest\"\r\nor a \"beau;\" you who are ashamed _not_ to be seen by others the\r\nmark of the most contemptuous flattery or injurious desire. To such I\r\ndo not speak. But to thee, maiden, who, if not so fair, art yet of\r\nthat unpolluted nature which Milton saw when he dreamed of Comus and\r\nthe Paradise. Thou, child of an unprofaned wedlock, brought up amid\r\nthe teachings of the woods and fields, kept fancy-free by useful\r\nemployment and a free flight into the heaven of thought, loving to\r\nplease only those whom thou wouldst not be ashamed to love; I ask of\r\nthee, whose cheek has not forgotten its blush nor thy heart its\r\nlark-like hopes, if he whom thou mayest hope the Father will send\r\nthee, as the companion of life's toils and joys, is not to thy thought\r\npure? Is not manliness to thy thought purity, not lawlessness? Can his\r\nlips speak falsely? Can he do, in secret, what he could not avow to\r\nthe mother that bore him? O say, dost thou not look for a heart free,\r\nopen as thine own, all whose thoughts may be avowed, incapable of\r\nwronging the innocent, or still further degrading the fallen--a man,\r\nin short, in whom brute nature is entirely subject to the impulses of\r\nhis better self?\r\n\r\nYes! it was thus that thou didst hope; for I have many, many times\r\nseen the image of a future life, of a destined spouse, painted on the\r\ntablets of a virgin heart.\r\n\r\nIt might be that she was not true to these hopes. She was taken into\r\nwhat is called \"the world,\" froth and scum as it mostly is on the\r\nsocial caldron. There, she saw fair Woman carried in the waltz close\r\nto the heart of a being who appeared to her a Satyr. Being warned by a\r\nmale friend that he was in fact of that class, and not fit for such\r\nfamiliar nearness to a chaste being, the advised replied that \"women\r\nshould know nothing about such things.\" She saw one fairer given in\r\nwedlock to a man of the same class. \"Papa and mamma said that 'all men\r\nwere faulty at some time in their lives; they had a great many\r\ntemptations.' Frederick would be so happy at home; he would not want\r\nto do wrong.\" She turned to the married women; they, O tenfold horror!\r\nlaughed at her supposing \"men were like women.\" Sometimes, I say, she\r\nwas not true, and either sadly accommodated herself to \"Woman's lot,\"\r\nor acquired a taste for satyr-society, like some of the Nymphs, and\r\nall the Bacchanals of old. But to those who could not and would not\r\naccept a mess of pottage, or a Circe cup, in lieu of their birthright,\r\nand to these others who have yet their choice to make, I say, Courage!\r\nI have some words of cheer for you. A man, himself of unbroken purity,\r\nreported to me the words of a foreign artist, that \"the world would\r\nnever be better till men subjected themselves to the same laws they\r\nhad imposed on women;\" that artist, he added, was true to the thought.\r\nThe same was true of Canova, the same of Beethoven. \"Like each other\r\ndemi-god, they kept themselves free from stain;\" and Michael Angelo,\r\nlooking over here from the loneliness of his century, might meet some\r\neyes that need not shun his glance.\r\n\r\nIn private life, I am assured by men who are not so sustained and\r\noccupied by the worship of pure beauty, that a similar consecration is\r\npossible, is practised; that many men feel that no temptation can be\r\ntoo strong for the will of man, if he invokes the aid of the Spirit\r\ninstead of seeking extenuation from the brute alliances of his nature.\r\nIn short, what the child fancies is really true, though almost the\r\nwhole world declares it a lie. Man is a child of God; and if he seeks\r\nHis guidance to keep the heart with diligence, it will be so given\r\nthat all the issues of life may be pure. Life will then be a temple.\r\n\r\n        The temple round\r\n  Spread green the pleasant ground;\r\n        The fair colonnade\r\n  Be of pure marble pillars made;\r\n  Strong to sustain the roof,\r\n        Time and tempest proof;\r\n  Yet, amidst which, the lightest breeze\r\n        Can play as it please;\r\n        The audience hall\r\n        Be free to all\r\n        Who revere\r\n  The power worshipped here,\r\n        Sole guide of youth,\r\n        Unswerving Truth.\r\n        In the inmost shrine\r\n        Stands the image divine,\r\n            Only seen\r\n  By those whose deeds have worthy been--\r\n        Priestlike clean.\r\n  Those, who initiated are,\r\n        Declare,\r\n        As the hours\r\n  Usher in varying hopes and powers;\r\n        It changes its face,\r\n          It changes its age,\r\n        Now a young, beaming grace,\r\n          Now Nestorian sage;\r\n        But, to the pure in heart,\r\n        This shape of primal art\r\n          In age is fair,\r\n            In youth seems wise,\r\n          Beyond compare,\r\n          Above surprise;\r\n        What it teaches native seems,\r\n          Its new lore our ancient dreams;\r\n        Incense rises from the ground;\r\n          Music flows around;\r\n      Firm rest the feet below, clear gaze the eyes above,\r\n  When Truth, to point the way through life, assumes the wand of Love;\r\n      But, if she cast aside the robe of green,\r\n        Winter's silver sheen,\r\n        White, pure as light,\r\n  Makes gentle shroud as worthy weed as bridal robe had been.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: As described by the historians:--\r\n  \"The temple of Juno is like what the character of Woman should be.\r\n   Columns! graceful decorums, attractive yet sheltering.\r\n   Porch! noble, inviting aspect of the life.\r\n   Kaos! receives the worshippers. See here the statue of the Divinity.\r\n   Ophistodpmos! Sanctuary where the most precious possessions were kept\r\n   safe from the hand of the spoiler and the eye of the world.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in a transition state, and but few steps have yet been\r\ntaken. From polygamy, Europe passed to the marriage _de convenance_.\r\nThis was scarcely an improvement An attempt was then made to substitute\r\ngenuine marriage (the mutual choice of souls inducing a permanent union),\r\nas yet baffled on every side by the haste, the ignorance, or the impurity\r\nof Man.\r\n\r\nWhere Man assumes a high principle to which he is not yet ripened, it\r\nwill happen, for a long time, that the few will be nobler than before;\r\nthe many, worse. Thus now. In the country of Sidney and Milton, the\r\nmetropolis is a den of wickedness, and a sty of sensuality; in the\r\ncountry of Lady Russell, the custom of English peeresses, of selling\r\ntheir daughters to the highest bidder, is made the theme and jest of\r\nfashionable novels by unthinking children who would stare at the idea\r\nof sending them to a Turkish slave-dealer, though the circumstances of\r\nthe bargain are there less degrading, as the will and thoughts of the\r\nperson sold are not so degraded by it, and it is not done in defiance\r\nof an acknowledged law of right in the land and the age.\r\n\r\nI must here add that I do not believe there ever was put upon record\r\nmore depravation of Man, and more despicable frivolity of thought and\r\naim in Woman; than in the novels which purport to give the picture of\r\nEnglish fashionable life, which are read with such favor in our\r\ndrawing-rooms, and give the tone to the manners of some circles.\r\nCompared with the cold, hard-hearted folly there described, crime is\r\nhopeful; for it, at least, shows some power remaining in the mental\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nTo return:--Attention has been awakened among men to the stains of\r\ncelibacy, and the profanations of marriage. They begin to write about\r\nit and lecture about it. It is the tendency now to endeavor to help\r\nthe erring by showing them the physical law. This is wise and\r\nexcellent; but forget not the better half. Cold bathing and exercise\r\nwill not suffice to keep a life pure, without an inward baptism, and\r\nnoble, exhilarating employment for the thoughts and the passions.\r\nEarly marriages are desirable, but if (and the world is now so out of\r\njoint that there are a hundred thousand chances to one against it) a\r\nman does not early, or at all, find the person to whom he can be\r\nunited in the marriage of souls, will you give him in the marriage\r\n_de convenance_? or, if not married, can you find no way for him\r\nto lead a virtuous and happy life? Think of it well, ye who think\r\nyourselves better than pagans, for many of _them_ knew this sure\r\nway. [Footnote: The Persian sacred books, the Desatir, describe the\r\ngreat and holy prince Ky Khosrou, as being \"an angel, and the son of\r\nan angel,\" one to whom the Supreme says, \"Thou art not absent from\r\nbefore me for one twinkling of an eye. I am never out of thy heart.\r\nAnd I am contained in nothing but in thy heart, and in a heart like\r\nthy heart. And I am nearer unto thee than thou art to thyself.\" This\r\nprince had in his Golden Seraglio three ladies of surpassing beauty,\r\nand all four, in this royal monastery, passed their lives, and left\r\nthe world as virgins.\r\n\r\nThe Persian people had no scepticism when the history of such a mind\r\nwas narrated.]\r\n\r\nTo you, women of America, it is more especially my business to address\r\nmyself on this subject, and my advice may be classed under three\r\nheads:\r\n\r\nClear your souls from the taint of vanity.\r\n\r\nDo not rejoice in conquests, either that your power to allure may be\r\nseen by other women, or for the pleasure of rousing passionate\r\nfeelings that gratify your love of excitement.\r\n\r\nIt must happen, no doubt, that frank and generous women will excite\r\nlove they do not reciprocate, but, in nine cases out of ten, the woman\r\nhas, half consciously, done much to excite. In this case, she shall\r\nnot be held guiltless, either as to the unhappiness or injury of the\r\nlover. Pure love, inspired by a worthy object, must ennoble and bless,\r\nwhether mutual or not; but that which is excited by coquettish\r\nattraction of any grade of refinement, must cause bitterness and\r\ndoubt, as to the reality of human goodness, so soon as the flush of\r\npassion is over. And, that you may avoid all taste for these false\r\npleasures,\r\n\r\n                         \"Steep the soul\r\n  In one pure love, and it will lost thee long.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe love of truth, the love of excellence, whether you clothe them in\r\nthe person of a special object or not, will have power to save you\r\nfrom following Duessa, and lead you in the green glades where Una's\r\nfeet have trod.\r\n\r\nIt was on this one subject that a venerable champion of good, the last\r\nrepresentative of the spirit which sanctified the Revolution, and gave\r\nour country such a sunlight of hope in the eyes of the nations, the\r\nsame who lately, in Boston, offered anew to the young men the pledge\r\ntaken by the young men of his day, offered, also, his counsel, on\r\nbeing addressed by the principal of a girl's school, thus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nREPLY OF MR. ADAMS.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams was so deeply affected by the address of Miss Foster, as to\r\nbe for some time inaudible. When heard, he spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"This is the first instance in which a lady has thus addressed me\r\npersonally; and I trust that all the ladies present will be able\r\nsufficiently to enter into my feelings to know that I am more affected\r\nby this honor than by any other I could hare received,\r\n\r\n\"You have been pleased, madam, to allude to the character of my\r\nfather, and the history of my family, and their services to the\r\ncountry. It is indeed true that, from the existence of the republic as\r\nan independent nation, my father and myself have been in the public\r\nservice of the country, almost without interruption. I came into the\r\nworld, as a person having personal responsibilities, with the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, which constituted us a nation. I was a\r\nchild at that time, and had then perhaps the greatest of blessings\r\nthat can be bestowed on man--a mother who was anxious and capable to\r\nform her children to be what they ought to be. From that mother I\r\nderived whatever instruction--religious especially and moral--has\r\npervaded a long life; I will not say perfectly, and as it ought to be;\r\nbut I will say, because it is justice only to the memory of her whom I\r\nrevere, that if, in the course of my life, there has been any\r\nimperfection, or deviation from what she taught me, the fault is mine,\r\nand not hers.\r\n\r\n\"With such a mother, and such other relations with the sex, of sister,\r\nwife, and daughter, it has been the perpetual instruction of my life\r\nto love and revere the female sex. And in order to carry that\r\nsentiment of love and reverence to its highest degree of perfection, I\r\nknow of nothing that exists in human society better adapted to produce\r\nthat result, than institutions of the character that I have now the\r\nhonor to address.\r\n\r\n\"I have been taught, as I have said, through the course of my life, to\r\nlove and to revere the female sex; but I have been taught, also--and\r\nthat lesson has perhaps impressed itself on my mind even more\r\nstrongly, it may be, than the other--I have been taught not to flatter\r\nthem. It is not unusual, in the intercourse of Man with the other\r\nsex--and especially for young men--to think that the way to win the\r\nhearts of ladies is by flattery. To love and to revere the sex, is\r\nwhat I think the duty of Man; _but not to flatter them;_ and this\r\nI would say to the young ladies here--and if they, and others present,\r\nwill allow me, with all the authority which nearly four score years\r\nmay have with those who have not yet attained one score--I would say\r\nto them what I have no doubt they say to themselves, and are taught\r\nhere, not to take the flattery of men as proof of perfection.\r\n\r\n\"I am now, however, I fear, assuming too much of a character that does\r\nnot exactly belong to me. I therefore conclude, by assuring you,\r\nmadam, that your reception of me has affected me, as you perceive,\r\nmore than I can express in words; and that I shall offer my best\r\nprayers, till my latest hour, to the Creator of us all, that this\r\ninstitution especially, and all others of a similar kind, designed to\r\nform the female mind to wisdom and virtue, may prosper to the end of\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to add here the character of Mr. Adams' mother,\r\nas drawn by her husband, the first John Adams, in a family letter\r\n[Footnote: Journal and Correspondence of Miss Adams, vol. i., p. 246.]\r\nwritten just before his death.\r\n\r\n\"I have reserved for the last the life of Lady Russell. This I have\r\nnot yet read, because I read it more than forty years ago. On this\r\nhangs a tale which you ought to know and communicate it to your\r\nchildren. I bought the Life and Letters of Lady Russell in the year\r\n1775, and sent it to your grandmother, with an express intent and\r\ndesire that she should consider it a mirror in which to contemplate\r\nherself; for, at that time, I thought it extremely probable, from the\r\ndaring and dangerous career I was determined to run, that she would\r\none day find herself in the situation of Lady Russell, her husband\r\nwithout a head. This lady was more beautiful than Lady Russell, had a\r\nbrighter genius, more information, a more refined taste, and, at\r\nleast, her equal in the virtues of the heart; equal fortitude and\r\nfirmness of character, equal resignation to the will of Heaven, equal\r\nin all the virtues and graces of the Christian life. Like Lady\r\nRussell, she never, by word or look, discouraged me from running all\r\nhazards for the salvation of my country's liberties; she was willing\r\nto share with me, and that her children should share with us both, in\r\nall the dangerous consequences we had to hazard.\"\r\n\r\nWill a woman who loves flattery or an aimless excitement, who wastes\r\nthe flower of her mind on transitory sentiments, ever be loved with a\r\nlove like that, when fifty years' trial have entitled to the\r\nprivileges of \"the golden marriage?\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the love of the iron-handed warrior for her, not his\r\nhand-maid, but his help-meet:\r\n\r\n\"Whom God loves, to him gives he such a wife.\"\r\n\r\nI find the whole of what I want in this relation, in the two epithets\r\nby which Milton makes Adam address _his_ wife.\r\n\r\nIn the intercourse of every day he begins:\r\n\r\n  \"Daughter of God and man, _accomplished_ Eve.\"\r\n  [Footnote: See Appendix H.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a moment of stronger feeling,\r\n\r\n  \"Daughter of God and man, IMMORTAL Eve.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat majesty in the cadence of the line; what dignity, what reverence\r\nin the attitude both of giver and receiver!\r\n\r\nThe woman who permits, in her life, the alloy of vanity; the woman who\r\nlives upon flattery, coarse or fine, shall never be thus addressed,\r\nShe is _not_ immortal so far as her will is concerned, and every\r\nwoman who does so creates miasma, whose spread is indefinite. The hand\r\nwhich casts into the waters of life a stone of offence knows not how\r\nfar the circles thus caused may spread their agitations.\r\n\r\nA little while since I was at one of the most fashionable places of\r\npublic resort. I saw there many women, dressed without regard to the\r\nseason or the demands of the place, in apery, or, as it looked, in\r\nmockery, of European fashions. I saw their eyes restlessly courting\r\nattention. I saw the way in which it was paid; the style of devotion,\r\nalmost an open sneer, which it pleased those ladies to receive from\r\nmen whose expression marked their own low position in the moral and\r\nintellectual world. Those women went to their pillows with their heads\r\nfull of folly, their hearts of jealousy, or gratified vanity; those\r\nmen, with the low opinion they already entertained of Woman confirmed.\r\nThese were American _ladies;_ that is, they were of that class\r\nwho have wealth and leisure to make full use of the day, and confer\r\nbenefits on others. They were of that class whom the possession of\r\nexternal advantages makes of pernicious example to many, if these\r\nadvantages be misused.\r\n\r\nSoon after, I met a circle of women, stamped by society as among the\r\nmost degraded of their sex. \"How,\" it was asked of them, \"did you come\r\nhere?\" for by the society that I saw in the former place they were\r\nshut up in a prison. The causes were not difficult to trace: love of\r\ndress, love of flattery, love of excitement. They had not dresses like\r\nthe other ladies, so they stole them; they could not pay for flattery\r\nby distinctions, and the dower of a worldly marriage, so they paid by\r\nthe profanation of their persons. In excitement, more and more madly\r\nsought from day to day, they drowned the voice of conscience.\r\n\r\nNow I ask you, my sisters, if the women at the fashionable house be\r\nnot answerable for those women being in the prison?\r\n\r\nAs to position in the world of souls, we may suppose the women of the\r\nprison stood fairest, both because they had misused less light, and\r\nbecause loneliness and sorrow had brought some of them to feel the\r\nneed of better life, nearer truth and good. This was no merit in them,\r\nbeing an effect of circumstance, but it was hopeful. But you, my\r\nfriends (and some of you I have already met), consecrate yourselves\r\nwithout waiting for reproof, in free love and unbroken energy, to win\r\nand to diffuse a better life. Offer beauty, talents, riches, on the\r\naltar; thus shall you keep spotless your own hearts, and be visibly or\r\ninvisibly the angels to others.\r\n\r\nI would urge upon those women who have not yet considered this\r\nsubject, to do so. Do not forget the unfortunates who dare not cross\r\nyour guarded way. If it do not suit you to act with those who have\r\norganized measures of reform, then hold not yourself excused from\r\nacting in private. Seek out these degraded women, give them tender\r\nsympathy, counsel, employment. Take the place of mothers, such as\r\nmight have saved them originally.\r\n\r\nIf you can do little for those already under the ban of the\r\nworld,--and the best-considered efforts have often failed, from a want\r\nof strength in those unhappy ones to bear up against the sting of\r\nshame and the prejudices of the world, which makes them seek oblivion\r\nagain in their old excitements,--you will at least leave a sense of\r\nlove and justice in their hearts, that will prevent their becoming\r\nutterly embittered and corrupt. And you may learn the means of\r\nprevention for those yet uninjured. These will be found in a diffusion\r\nof mental culture, simple tastes, best taught by your example, a\r\ngenuine self-respect, and, above all, what the influence of Man tends\r\nto hide from Woman, the love and fear of a divine, in preference to a\r\nhuman tribunal.\r\n\r\nBut suppose you save many who would have lost their bodily innocence\r\n(for as to mental, the loss of that is incalculably more general),\r\nthrough mere vanity and folly; there still remain many, the prey and\r\nspoil of the brute passions of Man; for the stories frequent in our\r\nnewspapers outshame antiquity, and vie with the horrors of war.\r\n\r\nAs to this, it must be considered that, as the vanity and proneness to\r\nseduction of the imprisoned women represented a general degradation in\r\ntheir sex; so do these acts a still more general and worse in the\r\nmale. Where so many are weak, it is natural there should be many lost;\r\nwhere legislators admit that ten thousand prostitutes are a fair\r\nproportion to one city, and husbands tell their wives that it is folly\r\nto expect chastity from men, it is inevitable that there should be\r\nmany monsters of vice.\r\n\r\nI must in this place mention, with respect and gratitude, the conduct\r\nof Mrs. Child in the case of Amelia Norman. The action and speech of\r\nthis lady was of straightforward nobleness, undeterred by custom or\r\ncavil from duty toward an injured sister. She showed the case and the\r\narguments the counsel against the prisoner had the assurance to use in\r\ntheir true light to the public. She put the case on the only ground of\r\nreligion and equity. She was successful in arresting the attention of\r\nmany who had before shrugged their shoulders, and let sin pass as\r\nnecessarily a part of the company of men. They begin to ask whether\r\nvirtue is not possible, perhaps necessary, to Man as well as to Woman.\r\nThey begin to fear that the perdition of a woman must involve that of\r\na man. This is a crisis. The results of this case will be important.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I must mention Eugene Sue, the French novelist,\r\nseveral of whose works have been lately translated among us, as having\r\nthe true spirit of reform as to women. Like every other French writer,\r\nhe is still tainted with the transmissions of the old _regime_.\r\nStill, falsehood may be permitted for the sake of advancing truth,\r\nevil as the way to good. Even George Sand, who would trample on every\r\ngraceful decorum, and every human law, for the sake of a sincere life,\r\ndoes not see that she violates it by making her heroines able to tell\r\nfalsehoods in a good cause. These French writers need ever to be\r\nconfronted by the clear perception of the English and German mind,\r\nthat the only good man, consequently the only good reformer, is he\r\n\r\n  \"Who bases good on good alone, and owes\r\n   To virtue every triumph that he knows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStill, Sue has the heart of a reformer, and especially towards women;\r\nhe sees what they need, and what causes are injuring them. From the\r\nhistories of Fleur de Marie and La Louve, from the lovely and\r\nindependent character of Rigolette, from the distortion given to\r\nMatilda's mind, by the present views of marriage, and from the truly\r\nnoble and immortal character of the \"hump-backed Sempstress\" in the\r\n\"Wandering Jew,\" may be gathered much that shall elucidate doubt and\r\ndirect inquiry on this subject. In reform, as in philosophy, the\r\nFrench are the interpreters to the civilized world. Their own\r\nattainments are not great, but they make clear the post, and break\r\ndown barriers to the future.\r\n\r\nObserve that the good man of Sue is as pure as Sir Charles Grandison.\r\n\r\nApropos to Sir Charles. Women are accustomed to be told by men that\r\nthe reform is to come _from them_. \"You,\" say the men, \"must\r\nfrown upon vice; you must decline the attentions of the corrupt; you\r\nmust not submit to the will of your husband when it seems to you\r\nunworthy, but give the laws in marriage, and redeem it from its\r\npresent sensual and mental pollutions.\"\r\n\r\nThis seems to us hard. Men have, indeed, been, for more than a hundred\r\nyears, rating women for countenancing vice. But, at the same time,\r\nthey have carefully hid from them its nature, so that the preference\r\noften shown by women for bad men arises rather from a confused idea\r\nthat they are bold and adventurous, acquainted with regions which\r\nwomen are forbidden to explore, and the curiosity that ensues, than a\r\ncorrupt heart in the woman. As to marriage, it has been inculcated on\r\nwomen, for centuries, that men have not only stronger passions than\r\nthey, but of a sort that it would be shameful for them to share or\r\neven understand; that, therefore, they must \"confide in their\r\nhusbands,\" that is, submit implicitly to their will; that the least\r\nappearance of coldness or withdrawal, from whatever cause, in the wife\r\nis wicked, because liable to turn her husband's thoughts to illicit\r\nindulgence; for a man is so constituted that he must indulge his\r\npassions or die!\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a great part of women look upon men as a kind of wild\r\nbeasts, but \"suppose they are all alike;\" the unmarried are assured by\r\nthe married that, \"if they knew men as they do,\" that is, by being\r\nmarried to them, \"they would not expect continence or self-government\r\nfrom them.\"\r\n\r\nI might accumulate illustrations on this theme, drawn from\r\nacquaintance with the histories of women, which would startle and\r\ngrieve all thinking men, but I forbear. Let Sir Charles Grandison\r\npreach to his own sex; or if none there be who feels himself able to\r\nspeak with authority from a life unspotted in will or deed, let those\r\nwho are convinced of the practicability and need of a pure life, as\r\nthe foreign artist was, advise the others, and warn them by their own\r\nexample, if need be.\r\n\r\nThe following passage, from a female writer, on female affairs,\r\nexpresses a prevalent way of thinking on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"It may be that a young woman, exempt from all motives of vanity,\r\ndetermines to take for a husband a man who does not inspire her with a\r\nvery decided inclination. Imperious circumstances, the evident\r\ninterest of her family, or the danger of suffering celibacy, may\r\nexplain such a resolution. If, however, she were to endeavor to\r\nsurmount a personal repugnance, we should look upon this as\r\n_injudicious_. Such a rebellion of nature marks the limit that\r\nthe influence of parents, or the self-sacrifice of the young girl,\r\nshould never pass. _We shall be told that this repugnance is an\r\naffair of the imagination_. It may be so; but imagination is a\r\npower which it is temerity to brave; and its antipathy is more\r\ndifficult to conquer than its preference.\" [Footnote: Madame Necker de\r\nSaussure.]\r\n\r\nAmong ourselves, the exhibition of such a repugnance from a woman who\r\nhad been given in marriage \"by advice of friends,\" was treated by an\r\neminent physician as sufficient proof of insanity. If he had said\r\nsufficient cause for it, he would have been nearer right.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by men who were pained by seeing bad men\r\nadmitted, freely, to the society of modest women,--thereby encouraged\r\nto vice by impunity, and corrupting the atmosphere of homes,--that\r\nthere should be a senate of the matrons in each city and town, who\r\nshould decide what candidates were fit for admission to their houses\r\nand the society of their daughters. [Footnote: See Goethe's Tasso. \"A\r\nsynod of good women should decide,\"--if the golden age is to be\r\nrestored.]\r\n\r\nSuch a plan might have excellent results; but it argues a moral\r\ndignity and decision which does not yet exist, and needs to be induced\r\nby knowledge and reflection. It has been the tone to keep women\r\nignorant on these subjects, or, when they were not, to command that\r\nthey should seem so. \"It is indelicate,\" says the father or husband,\r\n\"to inquire into the private character of such an one. It is\r\nsufficient that I do not think him unfit to visit you.\" And so, this\r\nman, who would not tolerate these pages in his house, \"unfit for\r\nfamily reading,\" because they speak plainly, introduces there a man\r\nwhose shame is written on his brow, as well as the open secret of the\r\nwhole town, and, presently, if _respectable_ still, and rich\r\nenough, gives him his daughter to wife. The mother affects ignorance,\r\n\"supposing he is no worse than most men.\" The daughter _is_\r\nignorant; something in the mind of the new spouse seems strange to\r\nher, but she supposes it is \"woman's lot\" not to be perfectly happy in\r\nher affections; she has always heard, \"men could not understand\r\nwomen,\" so she weeps alone, or takes to dress and the duties of the\r\nhouse. The husband, of course, makes no avowal, and dreams of no\r\nredemption.\r\n\r\n\"In the heart of every young woman,\" says the female writer above\r\nquoted, addressing herself to the husband, \"depend upon it, there is a\r\nfund of exalted ideas; she conceals, represses, without succeeding in\r\nsmothering them. _So long as these ideas in your wife are directed\r\nto YOU, they are, no doubt, innocent_, but take care that they be\r\nnot accompanied with _too much_ pain. In other respects, also,\r\nspare her delicacy. Let all the antecedent parts of your life, if\r\nthere are such, which would give her pain, be concealed from her;\r\n_her happiness and her respect for you would suffer from this\r\nmisplaced confidence._ Allow her to retain that flower of purity,\r\n_which should distinguish her, in your eyes, from every other\r\nwoman_.\" We should think so, truly, under this canon. Such a man\r\nmust esteem purity an exotic that could only be preserved by the\r\ngreatest care. Of the degree of mental intimacy possible, in such a\r\nmarriage, let every one judge for himself!\r\n\r\nOn this subject, let every woman, who has once begun to think, examine\r\nherself; see whether she does not suppose virtue possible and\r\nnecessary to Man, and whether she would not desire for her son a\r\nvirtue which aimed at a fitness for a divine life, and involved, if\r\nnot asceticism, that degree of power over the lower self, which shall\r\n\"not exterminate the passions, but keep them chained at the feet of\r\nreason.\" The passions, like fire, are a bad muster; but confine them\r\nto the hearth and the altar, and they give life to the social economy,\r\nand make each sacrifice meet for heaven.\r\n\r\nWhen many women have thought upon this subject, some will be fit for\r\nthe senate, and one such senate in operation would affect the morals\r\nof the civilized world.\r\n\r\nAt present I look to the young. As preparatory to the senate, I should\r\nlike to see a society of novices, such as the world has never yet\r\nseen, bound by no oath, wearing no badge, In place of an oath, they\r\nshould have a religious faith in the capacity of Man for virtue;\r\ninstead of a badge, should wear in the heart a firm resolve not to\r\nstop short of the destiny promised him as a son of God. Their service\r\nshould be action and conservatism, not of old habits, but of a better\r\nnature, enlightened by hopes that daily grow brighter.\r\n\r\nIf sin was to remain in the world, it should not be by their\r\nconnivance at its stay, or one moment's concession to its claims.\r\n\r\nThey should succor the oppressed, and pay to the upright the reverence\r\ndue in hero-worship by seeking to emulate them. They would not\r\ndenounce the willingly bad, but they could not be with them, for the\r\ntwo classes could not breathe the same atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThey would heed no detention from the time-serving, the worldly and\r\nthe timid.\r\n\r\nThey could love no pleasures that were not innocent and capable of\r\ngood fruit,\r\n\r\nI saw, in a foreign paper, the title now given to a party abroad, \"Los\r\nExaltados.\" Such would be the title now given these children by the\r\nworld: Los Exaltados, Las Exaltadas; but the world would not sneer\r\nalways, for from them would issue a virtue by which it would, at last,\r\nbe exalted too.\r\n\r\nI have in my eye a youth and a maiden whom I look to as the nucleus of\r\nsuch a class. They are both in early youth; both as yet\r\nuncontaminated; both aspiring, without rashness; both thoughtful; both\r\ncapable of deep affection; both of strong nature and sweet feelings;\r\nboth capable of large mental development. They reside in different\r\nregions of earth, but their place in the soul is the same. To them I\r\nlook, as, perhaps, the harbingers and leaders of a new era, for never\r\nyet have I known minds so truly virgin, without narrowness or\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\nWhen men call upon women to redeem them, they mean such maidens. But\r\nsuch are not easily formed under the present influences of society. As\r\nthere are more such young men to help give a different tone, there\r\nwill be more such maidens.\r\n\r\nThe English, novelist, D'Israeli, has, in his novel of \"The Young\r\nDuke,\" made a man of the most depraved stock be redeemed by a woman\r\nwho despises him when he has only the brilliant mask of fortune and\r\nbeauty to cover the poverty of his heart and brain, but knows how to\r\nencourage him when he enters on a better course. But this woman was\r\neducated by a father who valued character in women.\r\n\r\nStill, there will come now and then one who will, as I hope of my\r\nyoung Exaltada, be example and instruction for the rest. It was not\r\nthe opinion of Woman current among Jewish men that formed the\r\ncharacter of the mother of Jesus.\r\n\r\nSince the sliding and backsliding men of the world, no less than the\r\nmystics, declare that, as through Woman Man was lost, so through Woman\r\nmust Man be redeemed, the time must be at hand. When she knows herself\r\nindeed as \"accomplished,\" still more as \"immortal Eve,\" this may be.\r\n\r\nAs an immortal, she may also know and inspire immortal love, a\r\nhappiness not to be dreamed of under the circumstances advised in the\r\nlast quotation. Where love is based on concealment, it must, of\r\ncourse, disappear when the soul enters the scene of clear vision!\r\n\r\nAnd, without this hope, how worthless every plan, every bond, every\r\npower!\r\n\r\n\"The giants,\" said the Scandinavian Saga, \"had induced Loke (the\r\nspirit that hovers between good and ill) to steal for them Iduna\r\n(Goddess of Immortality) and her apples of pure gold. He lured her\r\nout, by promising to show, on a marvellous tree he had discovered,\r\napples beautiful as her own, if she would only take them with her for\r\na comparison. Thus having lured her beyond the heavenly domain, she\r\nwas seized and carried away captive by the powers of misrule.\r\n\r\n\"As now the gods could not find their friend Iduna, they were confused\r\nwith grief; indeed, they began visibly to grow old and gray. Discords\r\narose, and love grew cold. Indeed, Odur, spouse of the goddess of love\r\nand beauty, wandered away, and returned no more. At last, however, the\r\ngods, discovering the treachery of Loke, obliged him to win back Iduna\r\nfrom the prison in which she sat mourning. He changed himself into a\r\nfalcon, and brought her back as a swallow, fiercely pursued by the\r\nGiant King, in the form of an eagle. So she strives to return among\r\nus, light and small as a swallow. We must welcome her form as the\r\nspeck on the sky that assures the glad blue of Summer. Yet one swallow\r\ndoes not make a summer. Let us solicit them in flights and flocks!\"\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nReturning from the future to the present, let us see what forms Iduna\r\ntakes, as she moves along the declivity of centuries to the valley\r\nwhere the lily flower may concentrate all its fragrance.\r\n\r\nIt would seem as if this time were not very near to one fresh from\r\nbooks, such as I have of late been--no: _not_ reading, but\r\nsighing over. A crowd of books having been sent me since my friends\r\nknew me to be engaged in this way, on Woman's \"Sphere,\", Woman's\r\n\"Mission,\" and Woman's \"Destiny,\" I believe that almost all that is\r\nextant of formal precept has come under my eye. Among these I read\r\nwith refreshment a little one called \"The Whole Duty of Woman,\"\r\n\"indited by a noble lady at the request of a noble lord,\" and which\r\nhas this much of nobleness, that the view it takes is a religious one.\r\nIt aims to fit Woman for heaven; the main bent of most of the others\r\nis to fit her to please, or, at least, not to disturb, a husband.\r\n\r\nAmong these I select, as a favorable specimen, the book I have already\r\nquoted, \"The Study [Footnote: This title seems to be incorrectly\r\ntranslated from the French. I have not seen the original] of the Life\r\nof Woman, by Madame Necker de Saussure, of Geneva, translated from the\r\nFrench.\" This book was published at Philadelphia, and has been read\r\nwith much favor here. Madame Necker is the cousin of Madame de Stael,\r\nand has taken from her works the motto prefixed to this.\r\n\r\n\"Cette vie n'a quelque prix que si elle sert a' l'education morale do\r\nnotre coeur.\"\r\n\r\nMde. Necker is, by nature, capable of entire consistency in the\r\napplication of this motto, and, therefore, the qualifications she\r\nmakes, in the instructions given to her own sex, show forcibly the\r\nweight which still paralyzes and distorts the energies of that sex.\r\n\r\nThe book is rich in passages marked by feeling and good suggestions;\r\nbut, taken in the whole, the impression it leaves is this:\r\n\r\nWoman is, and _shall remain_, inferior to Man and subject to his\r\nwill, and, in endeavoring to aid her, we must anxiously avoid anything\r\nthat can be misconstrued into expression of the contrary opinion, else\r\nthe men will be alarmed, and combine to defeat our efforts.\r\n\r\nThe present is a good time for these efforts, for men are less\r\noccupied about women than formerly. Let us, then, seize upon the\r\noccasion, and do what we can to make our lot tolerable. But we must\r\nsedulously avoid encroaching on the territory of Man. If we study\r\nnatural history, our observations may be made useful, by some male\r\nnaturalist; if we draw well, we may make our services acceptable to\r\nthe artists. But our names must not be known; and, to bring these\r\nlabors to any result, we must take some man for our head, and be his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe lot of Woman is sad. She is constituted to expect and need a\r\nhappiness that cannot exist on earth. She must stifle such aspirations\r\nwithin her secret heart, and fit herself, as well as she can, for a\r\nlife of resignations and consolations.\r\n\r\nShe will be very lonely while living with her husband. She must not\r\nexpect to open her heart to him fully, or that, after marriage, he\r\nwill be capable of the refined service of love. The man is not born\r\nfor the woman, only the woman for the man. \"Men cannot understand the\r\nhearts of women.\" The life of Woman must be outwardly a\r\nwell-intentioned, cheerful dissimulation of her real life.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the feelings of the mother, at the birth of a female child,\r\nresemble those of the Paraguay woman, described by Southey as\r\nlamenting in such heart-breaking tones that her mother did not kill\r\nher the hour she was born,--\"her mother, who knew what this life of a\r\nwoman must be;\"--or of those women seen at the north by Sir A.\r\nMackenzie, who performed this pious duty towards female infants\r\nwhenever they had an opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"After the first delight, the young mother experiences feelings a\r\nlittle different, according as the birth of a son or a daughter has\r\nbeen announced.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a son? A sort of glory swells at this thought the heart of the\r\nmother; she seems to feel that she is entitled to gratitude. She has\r\ngiven a citizen, a defender, to her country; to her husband an heir of\r\nhis name; to herself a protector. And yet the contrast of all these\r\nfine titles with this being, so humble, soon strikes her. At the\r\naspect of this frail treasure, opposite feelings agitate her heart;\r\nshe seems to recognise in him _a nature superior to her own_, but\r\nsubjected to a low condition, and she honors a future greatness in the\r\nobject of extreme compassion. Somewhat of that respect and adoration\r\nfor a feeble child, of which some fine pictures offer the expression\r\nin the features of the happy Mary, seem reproduced with the young\r\nmother who has given birth to a son.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a daughter? There is usually a slight degree of regret; so\r\ndeeply rooted is the idea of the superiority of Man in happiness and\r\ndignity; and yet, as she looks upon this child, she is more and more\r\n_softened_ towards it. A deep sympathy--a sentiment of identity\r\nwith this delicate being--takes possession of her; an extreme pity for\r\nso much weakness, a more pressing need of prayer, stirs her heart.\r\nWhatever sorrows she may have felt, she dreads for her daughter; but\r\nshe will guide her to become much wiser, much better than herself. And\r\nthen the gayety, the frivolity of the young woman have their turn.\r\nThis little creature is a flower to cultivate, a doll to decorate.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar sadness at the birth of a daughter I have heard mothers\r\nexpress not unfrequently.\r\n\r\nAs to this living so entirely for men, I should think when it was\r\nproposed to women they would feel, at least, some spark of the old\r\nspirit of races allied to our own. \"If he is to be my bridegroom\r\n_and lord_\" cries Brunhilda, [Footnote: See the Nibelungen Lays.]\r\n\"he must first be able to pass through fire and water.\" \"I will serve\r\nat the banquet,\" says the Walkyrie, \"but only him who, in the trial\r\nof deadly combat, has shown himself a hero.\"\r\n\r\nIf women are to be bond-maids, let it be to men superior to women in\r\nfortitude, in aspiration, in moral power, in refined sense of beauty.\r\nYou who give yourselves \"to be supported,\" or because \"one must love\r\nsomething,\" are they who make the lot of the sex such that mothers are\r\nsad when daughters are born.\r\n\r\nIt marks the state of feeling on this subject that it was mentioned,\r\nas a bitter censure on a woman who had influence over those younger\r\nthan herself,--\"She makes those girls want to see heroes?\"\r\n\r\n\"And will that hurt them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly; how _can_ you ask? They will find none, and so they\r\nwill never be married.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Get_ married\" is the usual phrase, and the one that correctly\r\nindicates the thought; but the speakers, on this occasion, were\r\npersons too outwardly refined to use it. They were ashamed of the\r\nword, but not of the thing. Madame Necker, however, sees good possible\r\nin celibacy.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I know not how the subject could be better illustrated, than\r\nby separating the wheat from the chaff in Madame Necker's book; place\r\nthem in two heaps, and then summon the reader to choose; giving him\r\nfirst a near-sighted glass to examine the two;--it might be a\r\nChristian, an astronomical, or an artistic glass,--any kind of good\r\nglass to obviate acquired defects in the eye. I would lay any wager on\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nBut time permits not here a prolonged analysis. I have given the clues\r\nfor fault-finding.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of the good take the following passage, on the phenomena\r\nof what I have spoken of, as the lyrical or electric element in Woman.\r\n\r\n\"Women have been seen to show themselves poets in the most pathetic\r\npantomimic scenes, where all the passions were depicted full of\r\nbeauty; and these poets used a language unknown to themselves, and,\r\nthe performance once over, their inspiration was a forgotten dream.\r\nWithout doubt there is an interior development to beings so gifted;\r\nbut their sole mode of communication with us is their talent. They\r\nare, ill all besides, the inhabitants of another planet.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar observations have been made by those who have seen the women\r\nat Irish wakes, or the funeral ceremonies of modern Greece or Brittany,\r\nat times when excitement gave the impulse to genius; but, apparently,\r\nwithout a thought that these rare powers belonged to no other planet,\r\nbut were a high development of the growth of this, and might, by wise\r\nand reverent treatment, be made to inform and embellish the scenes of\r\nevery day. But, when Woman has her fair chance, she will do so, and\r\nthe poem of the hour will vie with that of the ages.\r\n\r\nI come now with satisfaction to my own country, and to a writer, a\r\nfemale writer, whom I have selected as the clearest, wisest, and\r\nkindliest, who has, as yet, used pen here on these subjects. This is\r\nMiss Sedgwick.\r\n\r\nMiss Sedgwick, though she inclines to the private path, and wishes\r\nthat, by the cultivation of character, might should vindicate right,\r\nsets limits nowhere, and her objects and inducements are pure. They\r\nare the free and careful cultivation of the powers that have been\r\ngiven, with an aim at moral and intellectual perfection. Her speech is\r\nmoderate and sane, but never palsied by fear or sceptical caution.\r\n\r\nHerself a fine example of the independent and beneficent existence\r\nthat intellect and character can give to Woman, no less than Man, if\r\nshe know how to seek and prize it,--also, that the intellect need not\r\nabsorb or weaken, but rather will refine and invigorate, the\r\naffections,--the teachings of her practical good sense come with great\r\nforce, and cannot fail to avail much. Every way her writings please me\r\nboth as to the means and the ends. I am pleased at the stress she lays\r\non observance of the physical laws, because the true reason is given.\r\nOnly in a strong and clean body can the soul do its message fitly.\r\n\r\nShe shows the meaning of the respect paid to personal neatness, both\r\nin the indispensable form of cleanliness, and of that love of order\r\nand arrangement, that must issue from a true harmony of feeling.\r\n\r\nThe praises of cold water seem to me an excellent sign in the age.\r\nThey denote a tendency to the true life. We are now to have, as a\r\nremedy for ills, not orvietan, or opium, or any quack medicine, but\r\nplenty of air and water, with due attention to warmth and freedom in\r\ndress, and simplicity of diet.\r\n\r\nEvery day we observe signs that the natural feelings on these subjects\r\nare about to be reinstated, and the body to claim care as the abode\r\nand organ of the soul; not as the tool of servile labor, or the object\r\nof voluptuous indulgence.\r\n\r\nA poor woman, who had passed through the lowest grades of ignominy,\r\nseemed to think she had never been wholly lost, \"for,\" said she, \"I\r\nwould always have good under-clothes;\" and, indeed, who could doubt\r\nthat this denoted the remains of private self-respect in the mind?\r\n\r\nA woman of excellent sense said, \"It might seem childish, but to her\r\none of the most favorable signs of the times was that the ladies had\r\nbeen persuaded to give up corsets.\"\r\n\r\nYes! let us give up all artificial means of distortion. Let life be\r\nhealthy, pure, all of a piece. Miss Sedgwick, in teaching that\r\ndomestics must have the means of bathing us much as their mistresses,\r\nand time, too, to bathe, has symbolized one of the most important of\r\nhuman rights.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting sign of the time is the influence exercised by two\r\nwomen, Miss Martineau and Miss Barrett, from their sick-rooms. The\r\nlamp of life which, if it had been fed only by the affections,\r\ndepended on precarious human relations, would scarce have been able to\r\nmaintain a feeble glare in the lonely prison, now shines far and wide\r\nover the nations, cheering fellow-sufferers and hallowing the joy of\r\nthe healthful.\r\n\r\nThese persons need not health or youth, or the charms of personal\r\npresence, to make their thoughts available. A few more such, and \"old\r\nwoman\" [Footnote: An apposite passage is quoted in Appendix F.] shall\r\nnot be the synonyme for imbecility, nor \"old maid\" a term of\r\ncontempt, nor Woman be spoken of as a reed shaken by the wind.\r\n\r\nIt is time, indeed, that men and women both should cease to grow old\r\nin any other way than as the tree does, full of grace and honor. The\r\nhair of the artist turns white, but his eye shines clearer than ever,\r\nand we feel that age brings him maturity, not decay. So would it be\r\nwith all, were the springs of immortal refreshment but unsealed within\r\nthe soul; then, like these women, they would see, from the lonely\r\nchamber window, the glories of the universe; or, shut in darkness, be\r\nvisited by angels.\r\n\r\nI now touch on my own place and day, and, as I write, events are\r\noccurring that threaten the fair fabric approached by so long an\r\navenue. Week before last, the Gentile was requested to aid the Jew to\r\nreturn to Palestine; for the Millennium, the reign of the Son of Mary\r\nwas near. Just now, at high and solemn mass, thanks were returned to\r\nthe Virgin for having delivered O'Connell from unjust imprisonment, in\r\nrequital of his having consecrated to her the league formed in behalf\r\nof Liberty on Tara's Hill. But last week brought news which threatens\r\nthat a cause identical with the enfranchisement of Jews, Irish, women,\r\nay, and of Americans in general, too, is in danger, for the choice of\r\nthe people threatens to rivet the chains of slavery and the leprosy of\r\nsin permanently on this nation, through the Annexation of Texas!\r\n\r\nAh! if this should take place, who will dare again to feel the throb\r\nof heavenly hope, as to the destiny of this country? The noble thought\r\nthat gave unity to all our knowledge, harmony to all our designs,--the\r\nthought that the progress of history had brought on the era, the\r\ntissue of prophecies pointed out the spot, where humanity was, at\r\nlast, to have a fair chance to know itself, and all men be born free\r\nand equal for the eagle's flight,--flutters as if about to leave the\r\nbreast, which, deprived of it, will have no more a nation, no more a\r\nhome on earth.\r\n\r\nWomen of my country!--Exaltadas! if such there be,--women of English,\r\nold English nobleness, who understand the courage of Boadicea, the\r\nsacrifice of Godiva, the power of Queen Emma to tread the red-hot iron\r\nunharmed,--women who share the nature of Mrs. Hutchinson, Lady\r\nRussell, and the mothers of our own revolution,--have you nothing to\r\ndo with this? You see the men, how they are willing to sell\r\nshamelessly the happiness of countless generations of fellow-creatures,\r\nthe honor of their country, and their immortal souls, for a money\r\nmarket and political power. Do you not feel within you that which can\r\nreprove them, which can check, which can convince them? You would not\r\nspeak in vain; whether each in her own home, or banded in unison.\r\n\r\nTell these men that you will not accept the glittering baubles,\r\nspacious dwellings, and plentiful service, they mean to offer you\r\nthrough those means. Tell them that the heart of Woman demands\r\nnobleness and honor in Man, and that, if they have not purity, have\r\nnot mercy, they are no longer fathers, lovers, husbands, sons of\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nThis cause is your own, for, as I have before said, there is a reason\r\nwhy the foes of African Slavery seek more freedom for women; but put\r\nit not upon that ground, but on the ground of right.\r\n\r\nIf you have a power, it is a moral power. The films of interest are\r\nnot so close around you as around the men. If you will but think, you\r\ncannot fail to wish to save the country from this disgrace. Let not\r\nslip the occasion, but do something to lift off the curse incurred by\r\nEve.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the women engaged in the Abolition movement accused of\r\nboldness, because they lifted the voice in public, and lifted the\r\nlatch of the stranger. But were these acts, whether performed\r\njudiciously or no, _so_ bold as to dare before God and Man to\r\npartake the fruits of such offence as this?\r\n\r\nYou hear much of the modesty of your sex. Preserve it by filling the\r\nmind with noble desires that shall ward off the corruptions of vanity\r\nand idleness. A profligate woman, who left her accustomed haunts and\r\ntook service in a New York boarding-house, said \"she had never heard\r\ntalk so vile at the Five Points, as from the ladies at the\r\nboarding-house.\" And why? Because they were idle; because, having\r\nnothing worthy to engage them, they dwelt, with unnatural curiosity,\r\non the ill they dared not go to see.\r\n\r\nIt will not so much injure your modesty to have your name, by the\r\nunthinking, coupled with idle blame, as to have upon your soul the\r\nweight of not trying to save a whole race of women from the scorn that\r\nis put upon _their_ modesty.\r\n\r\nThink of this well! I entreat, I conjure you, before it is too late.\r\nIt is my belief that something effectual might be done by women, if\r\nthey would only consider the subject, and enter upon it in the true\r\nspirit,--a spirit gentle, but firm, and which feared the offence of\r\nnone, save One who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have designated in outline, if not in fulness, the stream\r\nwhich is ever flowing from the heights of my thought.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier tract I was told I did not make my meaning sufficiently\r\nclear. In this I have consequently tried to illustrate it in various\r\nways, and may have been guilty of much repetition. Yet, as I am\r\nanxious to leave no room for doubt, I shall venture to retrace, once\r\nmore, the scope of my design in points, as wad done in old-fashioned\r\nsermons.\r\n\r\nMan is a being of two-fold relations, to nature beneath, and\r\nintelligences above him. The earth is his school, if not his\r\nbirth-place; God his object; life and thought his means of\r\ninterpreting nature, and aspiring to God.\r\n\r\nOnly a fraction of this purpose is accomplished in the life of any one\r\nman. Its entire accomplishment is to be hoped only from the sum of the\r\nlives of men, or Man considered as a whole.\r\n\r\nAs this whole has one soul and one body, any injury or obstruction to\r\na part, or to the meanest member, affects the whole. Man can never be\r\nperfectly happy or virtuous, till all men are so.\r\n\r\nTo address Man wisely, you must not forget that his life is partly\r\nanimal, subject to the same laws with Nature.\r\n\r\nBut you cannot address him wisely unless you consider him still more\r\nas soul, and appreciate the conditions and destiny of soul.\r\n\r\nThe growth of Man is two-fold, masculine and feminine.\r\n\r\nSo far as these two methods can be distinguished, they are so as\r\n\r\n  Energy and Harmony;\r\n  Power and Beauty;\r\n  Intellect and Love;\r\n\r\nor by some such rude classification; for we have not language\r\nprimitive and pure enough to express such ideas with precision.\r\n\r\nThese two sides are supposed to be expressed in Man and Woman, that\r\nis, as the more and the less, for the faculties have not been given\r\npure to either, but only in preponderance. There are also exceptions\r\nin great number, such as men of far more beauty than power, and the\r\nreverse. But, as a general rule, it seems to have been the intention\r\nto give a preponderance on the one side, that is called masculine, and\r\non the other, one that is called feminine.\r\n\r\nThere cannot be a doubt that, if these two developments were in\r\nperfect harmony, they would correspond to and fulfil one another, like\r\nhemispheres, or the tenor and bass in music.\r\n\r\nBut there is no perfect harmony in human nature; and the two parts\r\nanswer one another only now and then; or, if there be a persistent\r\nconsonance, it can only be traced at long intervals, instead of\r\ndiscoursing an obvious melody.\r\n\r\nWhat is the cause of this?\r\n\r\nMan, in the order of time, was developed first; as energy comes before\r\nharmony; power before beauty.\r\n\r\nWoman was therefore under his care as an elder. He might have been her\r\nguardian and teacher.\r\n\r\nBut, as human nature goes not straight forward, but by excessive\r\naction and then reaction in an undulated course, he misunderstood and\r\nabused his advantages, and became her temporal master instead of her\r\nspiritual sire.\r\n\r\nOn himself came the punishment. He educated Woman more as a servant\r\nthan a daughter, and found himself a king without a queen.\r\n\r\nThe children of this unequal union showed unequal natures, and, more\r\nand more, men seemed sons of the handmaid, rather than princess.\r\n\r\nAt last, there were so many Ishmaelites that the rest grew frightened\r\nand indignant. They laid the blame on Hagar, and drove her forth into\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\nBut there were none the fewer Ishmaelites for that.\r\n\r\nAt last men became a little wiser, and saw that the infant Moses was,\r\nin every case, saved by the pure instincts of Woman's breast. For, as\r\ntoo much adversity is better for the moral nature than too much\r\nprosperity, Woman, in this respect, dwindled less than Man, though in\r\nother respects still a child in leading-strings.\r\n\r\nSo Man did her more and more justice, and grew more and more kind.\r\n\r\nBut yet--his habits and his will corrupted by the past--he did not\r\nclearly see that Woman was half himself; that her interests were\r\nidentical with his; and that, by the law of their common being, he\r\ncould never reach his true proportions while she remained in any wise\r\nshorn of hers.\r\n\r\nAnd so it has gone on to our day; both ideas developing, but more\r\nslowly than they would under a clearer recognition of truth and\r\njustice, which would have permitted the sexes their due influence on\r\none another, and mutual improvement from more dignified relations.\r\n\r\nWherever there was pure love, the natural influences were, for the\r\ntime, restored.\r\n\r\nWherever the poet or artist gave free course to his genius, he saw the\r\ntruth, and expressed it in worthy forms, for these men especially\r\nshare and need the feminine principle. The divine birds need to be\r\nbrooded into life and song by mothers.\r\n\r\nWherever religion (I mean the thirst for truth and good, not the love\r\nof sect and dogma) had its course, the original design was apprehended\r\nin its simplicity, and the dove presaged sweetly from Dodona's oak.\r\n\r\nI have aimed to show that no age was left entirely without a witness\r\nof the equality of the sexes in function, duty and hope.\r\n\r\nAlso that, when there was unwillingness or ignorance, which prevented\r\nthis being acted upon, women had not the less power for their want of\r\nlight and noble freedom. But it was power which hurt alike them and\r\nthose against whom they made use of the arms of the servile,--cunning,\r\nblandishment, and unreasonable emotion.\r\n\r\nThat now the time has come when a clearer vision and better action are\r\npossible--when Man and Woman may regard one another, as brother and\r\nsister, the pillars of one porch, the priests of one worship.\r\n\r\nI have believed and intimated that this hope would receive an ampler\r\nfruition, than ever before, in our own land.\r\n\r\nAnd it will do so if this land carry out the principles from which\r\nsprang our national life.\r\n\r\nI believe that, at present, women are the best helpers of one another.\r\n\r\nLet them think; let them act; till they know what they need.\r\n\r\nWe only ask of men to remove arbitrary barriers. Some would like to do\r\nmore. But I believe it needs that Woman show herself in her native\r\ndignity, to teach them how to aid her; their minds are so encumbered\r\nby tradition.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Edward Fitzgerald travelled with the Indians, his manly\r\nheart obliged him at once to take the packs from the squaws and carry\r\nthem. But we do not read that the red men followed his example, though\r\nthey are ready enough to carry the pack of the white woman, because\r\nshe seems to them a superior being.\r\n\r\nLet Woman appear in the mild majesty of Ceres, and rudest churls will\r\nbe willing to learn from her.\r\n\r\nYou ask, what use will she make of liberty, when she has so long been\r\nsustained and restrained?\r\n\r\nI answer; in the first place, this will not be suddenly given. I read\r\nyesterday a debate of this year on the subject of enlarging women's\r\nrights over property. It was a leaf from the class-book that is\r\npreparing for the needed instruction. The men learned visibly as they\r\nspoke. The champions of Woman saw the fallacy of arguments on the\r\nopposite side, and were startled by their own convictions. With their\r\nwives at home, and the readers of the paper, it was the same. And so\r\nthe stream flows on; thought urging action, and action leading to the\r\nevolution of still better thought.\r\n\r\nBut, were this freedom to come suddenly, I have no fear of the\r\nconsequences. Individuals might commit excesses, but there is not only\r\nin the sex a reverence for decorums and limits inherited and enhanced\r\nfrom generation to generation, which many years of other life could\r\nnot efface, but a native love, in Woman as Woman, of proportion, of\r\n\"the simple art of not too much,\"--a Greek moderation, which would\r\ncreate immediately a restraining party, the natural legislators and\r\ninstructors of the rest, and would gradually establish such rules as\r\nare needed to guard, without impeding, life.\r\n\r\nThe Graces would lead the choral dance, and teach the rest to regulate\r\ntheir steps to the measure of beauty.\r\n\r\nBut if you ask me what offices they may fill, I reply--any. I do not\r\ncare what case you put; let them be sea-captains, if you will. I do\r\nnot doubt there are women well fitted for such an office, and, if so,\r\nI should be as glad to see them in it, as to welcome the maid of\r\nSaragossa, or the maid of Missolonghi, or the Suliote heroine, or\r\nEmily Plater.\r\n\r\nI think women need, especially at this juncture, a much greater range\r\nof occupation than they have, to rouse their latent powers. A party of\r\ntravellers lately visited a lonely hut on a mountain. There they found\r\nan old woman, who told them she and her husband had lived there forty\r\nyears. \"Why,\" they said, \"did you choose so barren a spot?\" She \"did\r\nnot know; _it was the man's notion.\"_\r\n\r\nAnd, during forty years, she had been content to act, without knowing\r\nwhy, upon \"the man's notion.\" I would not have it so.\r\n\r\nIn families that I know, some little girls like to saw wood, others to\r\nuse carpenters' tools. Where these tastes are indulged, cheerfulness\r\nand good-humor are promoted. Where they are forbidden, because \"such\r\nthings are not proper for girls,\" they grow sullen and mischievous.\r\n\r\nFourier had observed these wants of women, as no one can fail to do\r\nwho watches the desires of little girls, or knows the ennui that\r\nhaunts grown women, except where they make to themselves a serene\r\nlittle world by art of some kind. He, therefore, in proposing a great\r\nvariety of employments, in manufactures or the care of plants and\r\nanimals, allows for one third of women as likely to have a taste for\r\nmasculine pursuits, one third of men for feminine.\r\n\r\nWho does not observe the immediate glow and serenity that is diffused\r\nover the life of women, before restless or fretful, by engaging in\r\ngardening, building, or the lowest department of art? Here is\r\nsomething that is not routine, something that draws forth life towards\r\nthe infinite.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt, however, that a large proportion of women would give\r\nthemselves to the same employments as now, because there are\r\ncircumstances that must lead them. Mothers will delight to make the\r\nnest soft and warm. Nature would take care of that; no need to clip\r\nthe wings of any bird that wants to soar and sing, or finds in itself\r\nthe strength of pinion for a migratory flight unusual to its kind. The\r\ndifference would be that _all_ need not be constrained to\r\nemployments for which _some_ are unfit.\r\n\r\nI have urged upon the sex self-subsistence in its two forms of\r\nself-reliance and self-impulse, because I believe them to be the\r\nneeded means of the present juncture.\r\n\r\nI have urged on Woman independence of Man, not that I do not think the\r\nsexes mutually needed by one another, but because in Woman this fact\r\nhas led to an excessive devotion, which has cooled love, degraded\r\nmarriage, and prevented either sex from being what it should be to\r\nitself or the other.\r\n\r\nI wish Woman to live, _first_ for God's sake. Then she will not\r\nmake an imperfect man her god, and thus sink to idolatry. Then she\r\nwill not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and\r\npoverty. Then, if she finds what she needs in Man embodied, she will\r\nknow how to love, and be worthy of being loved.\r\n\r\nBy being more a soul, she will not be less Woman, for nature is\r\nperfected through spirit.\r\n\r\nNow there is no woman, only an overgrown child.\r\n\r\nThat her hand may be given with dignity, she must be able to stand\r\nalone. I wish to see men and women capable of such relations as are\r\ndepicted by Landor in his Pericles and Aspasia, where grace is the\r\nnatural garb of strength, and the affections are calm, because deep.\r\nThe softness is that of a firm tissue, as when\r\n\r\n      \"The gods approve\r\n  The depth, but not the tumult of the soul,\r\n  A fervent, not ungovernable love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA profound thinker has said, \"No married woman can represent the\r\nfemale world, for she belongs to her husband. The idea of Woman must\r\nbe represented by a virgin.\"\r\n\r\nBut that is the very fault of marriage, and of the present relation\r\nbetween the sexes, that the woman does belong to the man, instead of\r\nforming a whole with him. Were it otherwise, there would be no such\r\nlimitation to the thought.\r\n\r\nWoman, self-centred, would never be absorbed by any relation; it would\r\nbe only an experience to her as to man. It is a vulgar error that\r\nlove, _a_ love, to Woman is her whole existence; she also is born\r\nfor Truth and Love in their universal energy. Would she but assume her\r\ninheritance, Mary would not be the only virgin mother. Not Manzoni\r\nalone would celebrate in his wife the virgin mind with the maternal\r\nwisdom and conjugal affections. The soul is ever young, ever virgin.\r\n\r\nAnd will not she soon appear?--the woman who shall vindicate their\r\nbirthright for all women; who shall teach them what to claim, and how\r\nto use what they obtain? Shall not her name be for her era Victoria,\r\nfor her country and life Virginia? Yet predictions are rash; she\r\nherself must teach us to give her the fitting name.\r\n\r\nAn idea not unknown to ancient times has of late been revived, that,\r\nin the metamorphoses of life, the soul assumes the form, first of Man,\r\nthen of Woman, and takes the chances, and reaps the benefits of either\r\nlot. Why then, say some, lay such emphasis on the rights or needs of\r\nWoman? What she wins not as Woman will come to her as Man.\r\n\r\nThat makes no difference. It is not Woman, but the law of right, the\r\nlaw of growth, that speaks in us, and demands the perfection of each\r\nbeing in its kind--apple as apple, Woman as Woman. Without adopting\r\nyour theory, I know that I, a daughter, live through the life of Man;\r\nbut what concerns me now is, that my life be a beautiful, powerful, in\r\na word, a complete life in its kind. Had I but one more moment to live\r\nI must wish the same.\r\n\r\nSuppose, at the end of your cycle, your great world-year, all will be\r\ncompleted, whether I exert myself or not (and the supposition is\r\n_false_,--but suppose it true), am I to be indifferent about it?\r\nNot so! I must beat my own pulse true in the heart of the world; for\r\n_that_ is virtue, excellence, health.\r\n\r\nThou, Lord of Day! didst leave us to-night so calmly glorious, not\r\ndismayed that cold winter is coming, not postponing thy beneficence to\r\nthe fruitful summer! Thou didst smile on thy day's work when it was\r\ndone, and adorn thy down-going as thy up-rising, for thou art loyal,\r\nand it is thy nature to give life, if thou canst, and shine at all\r\nevents!\r\n\r\nI stand in the sunny noon of life. Objects no longer glitter in the\r\ndews of morning, neither are yet softened by the shadows of evening.\r\nEvery spot is seen, every chasm revealed. Climbing the dusty hill,\r\nsome fair effigies that once stood for symbols of human destiny have\r\nbeen broken; those I still have with me show defects in this broad\r\nlight. Yet enough is left, even by experience, to point distinctly to\r\nthe glories of that destiny; faint, but not to be mistaken streaks of\r\nthe future day. I can say with the bard,\r\n\r\n  \"Though many have suffered shipwreck, still beat noble hearts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways the soul says to us all, Cherish your best hopes as a faith,\r\nand abide by them in action. Such shall be the effectual fervent means\r\nto their fulfilment;\r\n\r\n    For the Power to whom we bow\r\n    Has given its pledge that, if not now,\r\n    They of pure and steadfast mind,\r\n    By faith exalted, truth refined,\r\n    _Shall_ hear all music loud and clear,\r\n    Whose first notes they ventured here.\r\n    Then fear not thou to wind the horn,\r\n    Though elf and gnome thy courage scorn;\r\n    Ask for the castle's King and Queen;\r\n    Though rabble rout may rush between,\r\n    Beat thee senseless to the ground,\r\n    In the dark beset thee round;\r\n    Persist to ask, and it will come;\r\n    Seek not for rest in humbler home;\r\n    So shalt thou see, what few have seen,\r\n    The palace home of King and Queen.\r\n\r\n  15_th November_, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMISCELLANIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGLAURON AND LAURIE.\r\n\r\nA DRIVE THROUGH THE COUNTRY NEAR BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAglauron and Laurie are two of the pleasantest men I know. Laurie\r\ncombines, with the external advantages of a beautiful person and easy\r\naddress, all the charm which quick perceptions and intelligent\r\nsympathy give to the intercourse of daily life. He has an extensive,\r\nthough not a deep, knowledge of men and books,--his naturally fine\r\ntaste has been more refined by observation, both at home and abroad,\r\nthan is usual in this busy country; and, though not himself a thinker,\r\nhe follows with care and delight the flights of a rapid and inventive\r\nmind. He is one of those rare persons who, without being servile or\r\nvacillating, present on no side any barrier to the free action of\r\nanother mind. Yes, he is really an agreeable companion. I do not\r\nremember ever to have been wearied or chilled in his company.\r\n\r\nAglauron is a person of far greater depth and force than his friend\r\nand cousin, but by no means as agreeable. His mind is ardent and\r\npowerful, rather than brilliant and ready,--neither does he with ease\r\nadapt himself to the course of another. But, when he is once kindled,\r\nthe blaze of light casts every object on which it falls into a bold\r\nrelief, and gives every scene a lustre unknown before. He is not,\r\nperhaps, strictly original in his thoughts; but the severe truth of\r\nhis character, and the searching force of his attention, give the\r\ncharm of originality to what he says. Accordingly, another cannot, by\r\nrepetition, do it justice. I have never any doubt when I write down or\r\ntell what Laurie says, but Aglauron must write for himself.\r\n\r\nYet I almost always take notes of what has passed, for the amusement\r\nof a distant friend, who is learning, amidst the western prairies,\r\npatience, and an appreciation of the poor benefits of our imperfectly\r\ncivilized state. And those I took this day, seemed not unworthy of a\r\nmore general circulation. The sparkle of talk, the free breeze that\r\nswelled its current, are always fled when you write it down; but there\r\nis a gentle flow, and truth to the moment, rarely attained in more\r\nelaborate compositions.\r\n\r\nMy two friends called to ask if I would drive with them into the\r\ncountry, and I gladly consented. It was a beautiful afternoon of the\r\nlast week in May. Nature seemed most desirous to make up for the time\r\nshe had lost, in an uncommonly cold and wet spring. The leaves were\r\nbursting from their sheaths with such rapidity that the trees seemed\r\nactually to greet you as you passed along. The vestal choirs of\r\nsnow-drops and violets were chanting their gentle hopes from every\r\nbank, the orchards were white with blossoms, and the birds singing in\r\nalmost tumultuous glee.\r\n\r\nWe drove for some time in silence, perhaps fearful to disturb the\r\nuniversal song by less melodious accents, when Aglauron said:\r\n\r\n\"How entirely are we new-born today! How are all the post cold skies\r\nand hostile breezes vanished before this single breath of sweetness!\r\nHow consoling is the truth thus indicated!\"\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. It is indeed the dearest fact of our consciousness,\r\nthat, in every moment of joy, pain is annihilated. There is no past,\r\nand the future is only the sunlight streaming into the far valley.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ Yet it was the night that taught us to prize the day.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ Even so. And I, you know, object to none of the \"dark\r\nmasters.\"\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. Nor I,--because I am sure that whatever is, is good;\r\nand to find out the _why_ is all our employment here. But one\r\nfeels so at home in such a day as this!\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ As this, indeed! I never heard so many birds, nor saw\r\nso many flowers. Do you not like these yellow flowers?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ They gleam upon the fields as if to express the\r\nbridal kiss of the sun. He seems most happy, if not most wealthy, when\r\nfirst he is wed to the earth.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ I believe I have some such feeling about these golden\r\nflowers. When I did not know what was the Asphodel, so celebrated by\r\nthe poets, I thought it was a golden flower; yet this yellow is so\r\nridiculed as vulgar.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. It is because our vulgar luxury depreciates objects\r\nnot fitted to adorn our dwellings. These yellow flowers will not bear\r\nbeing token out of their places and brought home to the centre-table.\r\nBut, when enamelling the ground, the cowslip, the king-cup,--nay, the\r\nmarigold and dandelion even,--are resplendently beautiful.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. They are the poor man's gold. See that dark, unpointed\r\nhouse, with its lilac shrubbery. As it stands, undivided from the road\r\nto which the green bank slopes down from the door, is not the effect\r\nof that enamel of gold dandelions beautiful?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. It seems as if a stream of peace had flowed from the\r\ndoor-step down to the very dust, in waves of light, to greet the\r\npasser-by. That is, indeed, a quiet house. It looks as if somebody's\r\ngrandfather lived there still.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. It is most refreshing to see the dark boards amid those\r\nhouses of staring white. Strange that, in the extreme heat of summer,\r\naching eyes don't teach the people better.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. We are still, in fact, uncivilized, for all our\r\nknowledge of what is done \"in foreign parts\" cannot make us otherwise.\r\nCivilization must be homogeneous,--must be a natural growth. This\r\nglistening white paint was long preferred because the most expensive;\r\njust as in the West, I understand, they paint houses red to make them\r\nresemble the hideous red brick. And the eye, thus spoiled by\r\nexcitement, prefers red or white to the stone-color, or the browns,\r\nwhich would harmonize with other hues.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. I should think the eye could never be spoiled so far as\r\nto like these white palings. These bars of glare amid the foliage are\r\nunbearable.\r\n\r\n_Myself_. What color should they be?\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. An invisible green, as in all civilized parts of the\r\nglobe. Then your eye would rest on the shrubbery undisturbed.\r\n\r\n_Myself_. Your vaunted Italy has its palaces of white stucco and\r\nbuildings of brick.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. Ay,--but the stucco is by the atmosphere soon mellowed\r\ninto cream-color, the brick into rich brown.\r\n\r\n_Myself_. I have heard a connoisseur admire our own red brick in\r\nthe afternoon sun, above all other colors.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. There are some who delight too much in the stimulus of\r\ncolor to be judges of harmony of coloring. It is so, often, with the\r\nItalians. No color is too keen for the eye of the Neapolitan. He\r\nthinks, with little Riding-hood, there is no color like red. I have\r\nseen one of the most beautiful new palaces paved with tiles of a\r\nbrilliant red. But this, too, is barbarism.\r\n\r\n_Myself_. You are pleased to call it so, because you make the\r\nEnglish your arbiters in point of taste; but I do not think they, on\r\nyour own principle, are our proper models. With their ever-weeping\r\nskies, and seven-piled velvet of verdure, they are no rule for us,\r\nwhose eyes are accustomed to the keen blue and brilliant clouds of our\r\nown realm, and who see the earth wholly green scarce two months in the\r\nyear. No white is more glistening than our January snows; no house\r\nhere hurts my eye more than the fields of white-weed will, a fortnight\r\nhence.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ True refinement of taste would bid the eye seek repose\r\nthe more. But, even admitting what you say, there is no harmony. The\r\narchitecture is borrowed from England; why not the rest?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ But, my friend, surely these piazzas and pipe-stem\r\npillars are all American.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ But the cottage to which they belong is English. The\r\ninhabitants, suffocating in small rooms, and beneath sloping roofs,\r\nbecause the house is too low to admit any circulation of air, are in\r\nneed, we must admit, of the piazza, for elsewhere they must suffer all\r\nthe torments of Mons. Chaubert in his first experience of the oven.\r\nBut I do not assail the piazzas, at any rate; they are most desirable,\r\nin these hot summers of ours, were they but in proportion with the\r\nhouse, and their pillars with one another. But I do object to houses\r\nwhich are desirable neither as summer nor winter residences here. The\r\nshingle palaces, celebrated by Irving's wit, were far more\r\nappropriate, for they, at least, gave free course to the winds of\r\nheaven, when the thermometer stood at ninety-five degrees in the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ Pity that American wit nipped in the bud those early\r\nattempts at an American architecture. Here in the East, alas! the case\r\nis become hopeless. But in the West the log-cabin still promises a\r\nproper basis.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ You laugh at me. But so it is. I am not so silly as to\r\ninsist upon American architecture, American art, in the 4th of July\r\nstyle, merely for the gratification of national vanity. But a\r\nbuilding, to be beautiful, should harmonize exactly with the uses to\r\nwhich it is to be put, and be an index to the climate and habits of\r\nthe people. There is no objection to borrowing good thoughts from\r\nother nations, if we adopt the new style because we find it will serve\r\nour convenience, and not merely because it looks pretty outside.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ I agree with you that here, as well as in manners and\r\nin literature, there is too ready access to the old stock, and, though\r\nI said it in jest, my hope is, in truth, the log-cabin. This the\r\nsettler will enlarge, as his riches and his family increase; he will\r\nbeautify as his character refines, and as his eye becomes accustomed\r\nto observe objects around him for their loveliness as well as for\r\ntheir utility. He will borrow from Nature the forms and coloring most\r\nin harmony with the scene in which his dwelling is placed. Might\r\ngrowth here be but slow enough! Might not a greediness for gain and\r\nshow cheat men of all the real advantages of their experience!\r\n\r\n(Here a carriage passed.)\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ Who is that beautiful lady to whom you bowed?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ Beautiful do you think her? At this distance, and\r\nwith the freshness which the open air gives to her complexion, she\r\ncertainly does look so, and was so still, five years ago, when I knew\r\nher abroad. It is Mrs. V----.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ I remember with what interest you mentioned her in your\r\nletters. And you promised to tell me her true story.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ I was much interested, then, both in her and her\r\nstory, But, last winter, when I met her at the South, she had altered,\r\nand seemed so much less attractive than before, that the bright colors\r\nof the picture are well-nigh effaced.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ The pleasure of telling the story will revive them\r\nagain. Let us fasten our horses and go into this little wood. There is\r\na seat near the lake which is pretty enough to tell a story upon.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ In all the idyls I ever read, they were told in\r\ncaves, or beside a trickling fountain.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ That was in the last century. We will innovate. Let us\r\nbegin that American originality we were talking about, and make the\r\nbank of a lake answer our purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe dismounted accordingly, but, on reaching the spot, Aglauron at\r\nfirst insisted on lying on the grass, and gazing up at the clouds in a\r\nmost uncitizen-like fashion, and it was some time before we could get\r\nthe promised story. At last,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI first saw Mrs. V---- at the opera in Vienna. Abroad, I scarcely cared\r\nfor anything in comparison with music. In many respects the Old World\r\ndisappointed my hopes; Society was, in essentials, no better, nor\r\nworse, than at home, and I too easily saw through the varnish of\r\nconventional refinement. Lions, seen near, were scarcely more\r\ninteresting than tamer cattle, and much more annoying in their gambols\r\nand caprices. Parks and ornamental grounds pleased me less than the\r\nnative forests and wide-rolling rivers of my own land. But in the\r\nArts, and most of all in Music, I found all my wishes more than\r\nrealized. I found the soul of man uttering itself with the swiftness,\r\nthe freedom and the beauty, for which I had always pined. I easily\r\nconceived how foreigners, once acquainted with this diverse language,\r\npass their lives without a wish for pleasure or employment beyond\r\nhearing the great works of the masters. It seemed to me that here was\r\nwealth to feed the thoughts for ages. This lady fixed my attention by\r\nthe rapturous devotion with which she listened. I saw that she too had\r\nhere found her proper home. Every shade of thought and feeling\r\nexpressed in the music was mirrored in her beautiful countenance. Her\r\nrapture of attention, during some passages, was enough of itself to\r\nmake you hold your breath; and a sudden stroke of genius lit her face\r\ninto a very heaven with its lightning. It seemed to me that in her I\r\nshould find one who would truly sympathize with me, one who looked on\r\nthe art not as a connoisseur, but a votary.\r\n\r\nI took the speediest opportunity of being introduced to her at her own\r\nhouse by a common friend.\r\n\r\nBut what a difference! At home I scarcely knew her. Still she was\r\nbeautiful; but the sweetness, the elevated expression, which the\r\nsatisfaction of an hour had given her, were entirely fled. Her eye was\r\nrestless, her cheek pale and thin, her whole expression perturbed and\r\nsorrowful. Every gesture spoke the sickliness of a spirit long an\r\noutcast from its natural home, bereft of happiness, and hopeless of\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nI perceived, at first sight of her every-day face, that it was not\r\nunknown to me. Three or four years earlier, staying in the\r\ncountry-house of one of her friends, I had seen her picture. The house\r\nwas very dull,--as dull as placid content with the mere material\r\nenjoyments of life, and an inert gentleness of nature, could make its\r\ninhabitants. They were people to be loved, but loved without a\r\nthought. Their wings had never grown, nor their eyes coveted a wider\r\nprospect than could be seen from the parent nest. The friendly\r\nvisitant could not discompose them by a remark indicating any\r\nexpansion of mind or life. Much as I enjoyed the beauty of the country\r\naround, when out in the free air, my hours within the house would have\r\nbeen dull enough but for the contemplation of this picture. While the\r\nround of common-place songs was going on, and the whist-players were\r\nat their work, I used to sit and wonder how this being, so sovereign\r\nin the fire of her nature, so proud in her untamed loveliness, could\r\never have come of their blood. Her eye, from the canvas, even, seemed\r\nto annihilate all things low or little, and able to command all\r\ncreation in search of the object of its desires. She had not found it,\r\nthough; I felt this on seeing her now. She, the queenly woman, the\r\nBoadicea of a forlorn hope, as she seemed born to be, the only woman\r\nwhose face, to my eye, had ever given promise of a prodigality of\r\nnature sufficient for the entertainment of a poet's soul, was--I saw\r\nit at a glance--a captive in her life, and a beggar in her affections.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ A dangerous object to the traveller's eye, methinks!\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ Not to mine! The picture had been so; but, seeing her\r\nnow, I felt that the glorious promise of her youthful prime had\r\nfailed. She had missed her course; and the beauty, whose charm to the\r\nimagination had been that it seemed invincible, was now subdued and\r\nmixed with earth.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ I can never comprehend the cruelty in your way of\r\nviewing human beings, Aglauron. To err, to suffer, is their lot; all\r\nwho have feeling and energy of character must share it; and I could\r\nnot endure a woman who at six-and-twenty bore no trace of the past.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ Such women and such men are the companions of\r\neveryday life. But the angels of our thoughts are those moulds of pure\r\nbeauty which must break with a fall. The common air must not touch\r\nthem, for they make their own atmosphere. I admit that such are not\r\nfor the tenderness of daily life; their influence must be high,\r\ndistant, starlike, to be pure.\r\n\r\nSuch was this woman to me before I knew her; one whose splendid beauty\r\ndrew on my thoughts to their future home. In knowing her, I lost the\r\nhappiness I had enjoyed in knowing what she should have been. At first\r\nthe disappointment was severe, but I have learnt to pardon her, as\r\nothers who get mutilated or worn in life, and show the royal impress\r\nonly in their virgin courage. But this subject would detain me too\r\nlong. Let me rather tell you of Mrs. V----'s sad history.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine has said that beautiful persons seem rarely born to\r\ntheir proper family, but amidst persons so rough and uncongenial that\r\n_their_ presence commands like that of a reproving angel, or\r\npains like that of some poor prince changed at nurse, and bound for\r\nlife to the society of churls.\r\n\r\nSo it was with Emily. Her father was sordid, her mother weak; persons\r\nof great wealth and greater selfishness. She was the youngest by many\r\nyears, and left alone in her father's house. Notwithstanding the want\r\nof intelligent sympathy while she was growing up, and the want of all\r\nintelligent culture, she was not an unhappy child. The unbounded and\r\nfoolish indulgence with which she was treated did not have an\r\nobviously bad effect upon her then; it did not make her selfish,\r\nsensual, or vain. Her character was too powerful to dwell upon such\r\nboons as those nearest her could bestow. She negligently received them\r\nall as her due. It was later that the pernicious effects of the\r\nabsence of all discipline showed themselves; but in early years she\r\nwas happy in her lavish feelings, and in beautiful nature, on which\r\nshe could pour them, and in her own pursuits. Music was her passion;\r\nin it she found food, and an answer for feelings destined to become so\r\nfatal to her peace, but which then glowed so sweetly in her youthful\r\nform as to enchant the most ordinary observer.\r\n\r\nWhen she was not more than fifteen, and expanding like a flower in\r\neach sunny day, it was her misfortune that her first husband saw and\r\nloved her. Emily, though pleased by his handsome person and gay\r\nmanners, never bestowed a serious thought on him. If she had, it would\r\nhave been the first ever disengaged from her life of pleasurable\r\nsensation. But when he did plead his cause with all the ardor of\r\nyouth, and the flourishes which have been by usage set apart for such\r\noccasions, she listened with delight; for all his talk of boundless\r\nlove, undying faith, etc., seemed her native tongue. It was like the\r\nmost glowing sunset sky. It swelled upon the ear like music. It was\r\nthe only way she ever wished to be addressed, and she now saw plainly\r\nwhy all talk of everyday people had fallen unheeded on her ear. She\r\ncould have listened all day. But when, emboldened by the beaming eye\r\nand ready smile with which she heard, he pressed his suit more\r\nseriously, and talked of marriage, she drew back astonished. Marry\r\nyet?--impossible! She had never thought of it; and as she thought now\r\nof marriages, such as she had seen them, there was nothing in marriage\r\nto attract. But L---- was not so easily repelled; he made her every\r\npromise of pleasure, as one would to a child. He would take her away\r\nto journey through scenes more beautiful than she had ever dreamed of;\r\nhe would take her to a city where, in the fairest home, she should\r\nhear the finest music, and he himself, in every scene, would be her\r\ndevoted slave, too happy if for every now pleasure he received one of\r\nthose smiles which had become his life.\r\n\r\nHe saw her yielding, and hastened to secure her. Her father was\r\ndelighted, as fathers are strangely wont to be, that he was likely to\r\nbe deprived of his child, his pet, his pride. The mother was threefold\r\ndelighted that she would have a daughter married so _young_,--at\r\nleast three years younger than any of her elder sisters were married.\r\nBoth lent their influence; and Emily, accustomed to rely on them\r\nagainst all peril, and annoyance, till she scarcely knew there was\r\npain or evil in the world, gave her consent, as she would have given\r\nit to a pleasure-party for a day or a week.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was hurried on; L---- intent on gaining his object, as\r\nmen of strong will and no sentiment are wont to be, the parents\r\nthinking of the eclat of the match. Emily was amused by the\r\npreparations for the festivity, and full of excitement about the new\r\nchapter which was to be opened in her life. Yet so little idea had she\r\nof the true business of life, and the importance of its ties, that\r\nperhaps there was no figure in the future that occupied her less than\r\nthat of her bridegroom, a handsome man, with a sweet voice, her\r\ncaptive, her adorer. She neither thought nor saw further, lulled by\r\nthe pictures of bliss and adventure which were floating before her\r\nfancy, the more enchanting because so vague.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the picture that so charmed me was taken. The\r\nexquisite rose had not yet opened its leaves so as to show its heart;\r\nbut its fragrance and blushful pride were there in perfection.\r\n\r\nPoor Emily! She had the promised journeys, the splendid home. Amid the\r\nformer her mind, opened by new scenes, already learned that something\r\nshe seemed to possess was wanting in the too constant companion of her\r\ndays. In the splendid home she received not only musicians, but other\r\nvisitants, who taught her strange things.\r\n\r\nFour little months after her leaving home, her parents were astonished\r\nby receiving a letter in which she told them they had parted with her\r\ntoo soon; that she was not happy with Mr. L----, as he had promised\r\nshe should be, and that she wished to have her marriage broken. She\r\nurged her father to make haste about it, as she had particular reasons\r\nfor impatience. You may easily conceive of the astonishment of the\r\ngood folks at home. Her mother wondered and cried. Her father\r\nimmediately ordered his horses, and went to her.\r\n\r\nHe was received with rapturous delight, and almost at the first moment\r\nthanked for his speedy compliance with her request. But when she found\r\nthat he opposed her desire of having her marriage broken, and when she\r\nurged him with vehemence and those marks of caressing fondness she had\r\nbeen used to find all-powerful, and he told her at last it could not\r\nbe done, she gave way to a paroxysm of passion; she declared that she\r\ncould not and would not live with Mr. L----; that, so soon as she saw\r\nanything of the world, she saw many men that she infinitely preferred\r\nto him; and that, since her father and mother, instead of guarding\r\nher, so mere a child as she was, so entirely inexperienced, against a\r\nhasty choice, had persuaded and urged her to it, it was their duty to\r\nbreak the match when they found it did not make her happy.\r\n\r\n\"My child, you are entirely unreasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not a time to be patient; and I was too yielding before. I am\r\nnot seventeen. Is the happiness of my whole life to be sacrificed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Emily, you terrify me! Do you love anybody else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; but I am sure shall find some one to love, now I know what\r\nit is. I have seen already many whom I prefer to Mr. L----.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he not kind to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind! yes; but he is perfectly uninteresting. I hate to be with him.\r\nI do not wish his kindness, nor to remain in his house.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain her father argued; she insisted that she could never be happy\r\nas she was; that it was impossible the law could be so cruel as to\r\nbind her to a vow she had taken when so mere a child; that she would\r\ngo home with her father now, and they would see what could be done.\r\nShe added that she had already told her husband her resolution.\r\n\r\n\"And how did he bear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very angry; but it is better for him to be angry once than\r\nunhappy always, as I should certainly make him did I remain here.\"\r\n\r\nAfter long and fruitless attempts to reason her into a different state\r\nof mind, the father went in search of the husband. He found him\r\nirritated and mortified. He loved his wife, in his way, for her\r\npersonal beauty. He was very proud of her; he was piqued to the last\r\ndegree by her frankness. He could not but acknowledge the truth of\r\nwhat she said, that she had been persuaded into the match when but a\r\nchild; for she seemed a very infant now, in wilfulness and ignorance\r\nof the world. But I believe neither he nor her father had one\r\ncompunctious misgiving as to their having profaned the holiness of\r\nmarriage by such an union. Their minds had never been opened to the\r\ntrue meaning of life, and, though they thought themselves so much\r\nwiser, they were in truth much less so than the poor, passionate\r\nEmily,--for her heart, at least, spoke clearly, if her mind lay in\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThey could do nothing with her, and her father was at length compelled\r\nto take her home, hoping that her mother might be able to induce her\r\nto see things in a different light. But father, mother, uncles,\r\nbrothers, all reasoned with her in vain. Totally unused to\r\ndisappointment, she could not for a long time believe that she was\r\nforever bound by a bond that sat uneasily on her untamed spirit. When\r\nat last convinced of the truth, her despair was terrible.\r\n\r\n\"Am I his? his forever? Must I never then love? Never marry one whom I\r\ncould really love? Mother! it is too cruel. I cannot, will not believe\r\nit. You always wished me to belong to him. You do not now wish to aid\r\nme, or you are afraid! O, you would not be so, could you but know what\r\nI feel!\"\r\n\r\nAt last convinced, she then declared that if she could not be legally\r\nseparated from L----, but must consent to bear his name, and never\r\ngive herself to another, she would at least live with him no more. She\r\nwould not again leave her father's house. Here she was deaf to all\r\nargument, and only force could have driven her away. Her indifference\r\nto L---- had become hatred, in the course of these thoughts and\r\nconversations. She regarded herself as his victim, and him as her\r\nbetrayer, since, she said, he was old enough to know the importance of\r\nthe step to which he led her. Her mind, naturally noble, though now in\r\nthis wild state, refused to admit his love as an excuse. \"Had he loved\r\nme,\" she said, \"he would have wished to teach me to love him, before\r\nsecuring me as his property. He is as selfish as he is dull and\r\nuninteresting. No! I will drag on my miserable years here alone, but I\r\nwill not pretend to love him nor gratify him by the sight of his\r\nslave!\"\r\n\r\nA year and more passed, and found the unhappy Emily inflexible. Her\r\nhusband at last sought employment abroad, to hide his mortification.\r\n\r\nAfter his departure, Emily relaxed once from the severe coldness she\r\nhad shown since her return home. She had passed her time there with\r\nher music, in reading poetry, in solitary walks. But as the person who\r\nhad been, however unintentionally, the means of making her so\r\nmiserable, was further removed from her, she showed willingness to\r\nmingle again with the family, and see one or two young friends.\r\n\r\nOne of these, Almeria, effected what all the armament of praying and\r\nthreatening friends had been unable to do. She devoted herself to\r\nEmily. She shared her employments and her walks; she sympathized with\r\nall her feelings, even the morbid ones which she saw to be sincerity,\r\ntenderness and delicacy gone astray,--perverted and soured by the\r\nfoolish indulgence of her education, and the severity of her destiny\r\nmade known suddenly to a mind quite unprepared. At last, having won\r\nthe confidence and esteem of Emily, by the wise and gentle cheek her\r\njustice and clear perceptions gave to all extravagance, Almeria\r\nventured on representing to Emily her conduct as the world saw it.\r\n\r\nTo this she found her quite insensible. \"What is the world to me?\" she\r\nsaid. \"I am forbidden to seek there all it can offer of value to\r\nWoman--sympathy and a home.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is full of beauty still,\" said Almeria, looking out into the\r\ngolden and perfumed glories of a June day.\r\n\r\n\"Not to the prisoner and the slave,\" said Emily.\r\n\r\n\"All are such, whom God hath not made free;\" and Almeria gently\r\nventured to explain the hopes of larger span which enable the soul\r\nthat can soar upon their wings to disregard the limitations of seventy\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nEmily listened with profound attention. The words were familiar to\r\nher, but the tone was not; it was that which rises from the depths of\r\na purified spirit,--purified by pain, softened into peace.\r\n\r\n\"Have you made any use of these thoughts in your life, Almeria?\"\r\n\r\nThe lovely preacher hesitated not to reveal a tale before unknown\r\nexcept to her own heart, of woe, renunciation, and repeated blows from\r\na hostile fate.\r\n\r\nEmily heard it in silence, but she understood. The great illusions of\r\nyouth vanished. She did not suffer alone; her lot was not peculiar.\r\nAnother, perhaps many, were forbidden the bliss of sympathy and a\r\ncongenial environment. And what had Almeria done? Revenged herself?\r\nTormented all around her? Clung with wild passion to a selfish\r\nresolve? Not at all. She had made the best of a wreck of life, and\r\ndeserved a blessing on a new voyage. She had sought consolation in\r\ndisinterested tenderness for her fellow-sufferers, and she deserved to\r\ncease to suffer.\r\n\r\nThe lesson was taken home, and gradually leavened the whole being of\r\nthis spoiled but naturally noble child.\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards, she asked her father when Mr. L---- was\r\nexpected to return.\r\n\r\n\"In about three months,\" he replied, much surprised.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to have you write to him for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What now absurdity?\" said the father, who, long mortified and\r\nharassed, had ceased to be a fond father to his once adored Emily.\r\n\r\n\"Say that my views are unchanged as to his soliciting a marriage with\r\nme when too childish to know my own mind on that or any other subject;\r\nbut I have now seen enough of the world to know that he meant no ill,\r\nif no good, and was no more heedless in this great matter than many\r\nothers are. He is not born to know what one constituted like me must\r\nfeel, in a home where I found no rest for my heart. I have now read,\r\nseen and thought, what has made me a woman. I can be what you call\r\nreasonable, though not perhaps in your way. I see that my misfortune\r\nis irreparable. I heed not the world's opinion, and would, for myself,\r\nrather remain here, and keep up no semblance of a connection which my\r\nmatured mind disclaims. But that scandalizes you and my mother, and\r\nmakes your house a scene of pain and mortification in your old age. I\r\nknow you, too, did not neglect the charge of me, in your own eyes. I\r\nowe you gratitude for your affectionate intentions at least.\r\n\r\n\"L---- too is as miserable as mortification can make one like him.\r\nWrite, and ask him if he wishes my presence in his house on my own\r\nterms. He must not expect from me the affection, or marks of\r\naffection, of a wife. I should never have been his wife had I waited\r\ntill I understood life or myself. But I will be his attentive and\r\nfriendly companion, the mistress of his house, if he pleases. To the\r\nworld it will seem enough,--he will be more comfortable there,--and\r\nwhat he wished of me was, in a great measure, to show me to the world.\r\nI saw that, as soon as we were in it, I could not give him happiness\r\nif I would, for we have not a thought nor employment in common. But if\r\nwe can agree on the way, we may live together without any one being\r\nvery miserable except myself, and I have made up my mind.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonishment of the father may be conceived, and his cavils;\r\nL----'s also.\r\n\r\nTo cut the story short, it was settled in Emily's way, for she was one\r\nof the sultana kind, dread and dangerous. L---- hardly wished her to\r\nlove him now, for he half hated her for all she had done; yet he was\r\nglad to have her back, as she had judged, for the sake of appearances.\r\nAll was smoothed over by a plausible story. People, indeed, knew the\r\ntruth as to the fair one's outrageous conduct perfectly, but Mr. L----\r\nwas rich, his wife beautiful, and gave good parties; so society, as\r\nsuch, bowed and smiled, while individuals scandalized the pair.\r\n\r\nThey had been living on this footing for several years, when I saw\r\nEmily at the opera. She was a much altered being. Debarred of\r\nhappiness in her affections, she had turned for solace to the\r\nintellectual life, and her naturally powerful and brilliant mind had\r\nmatured into a splendor which had never been dreamed of by those who\r\nhad seen her amid the freaks end day-dreams of her early youth.\r\n\r\nYet, as I said before, she was not captivating to me, as her picture\r\nhad been. She was, in a different way, as beautiful in feature and\r\ncoloring as in her spring-time. Her beauty, all moulded and mellowed\r\nby feeling, was far more eloquent; but it had none of the virgin\r\nmagnificence, the untouched tropical luxuriance, which had fired my\r\nfancy. The false position in which she lived had shaded her expression\r\nwith a painful restlessness; and her eye proclaimed that the conflicts\r\nof her mind had strengthened, had deepened, but had not yet hallowed,\r\nher character.\r\n\r\nShe was, however, interesting, deeply so; one of those rare beings who\r\nfill your eye in every mood. Her passion for music, and the great\r\nexcellence she had attained as a performer, drew us together. I was\r\nher daily visitor; but, if my admiration ever softened into\r\ntenderness, it was the tenderness of pity for her unsatisfied heart,\r\nand cold, false life.\r\n\r\nBut there was one who saw with very different eyes. V---- had been\r\nintimate with Emily some time before my arrival, and every day saw him\r\nmore deeply enamored.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ And pray where was the husband all this time?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ L---- had sought consolation in ambition. He was a\r\nman of much practical dexterity, but of little thought, and less\r\nheart. He had at first been jealous of Emily for his honor's\r\nsake,--not for any reality,--for she treated him with great attention\r\nas to the comforts of daily life; but otherwise, with polite, steady\r\ncoldness. Finding that she received the court, which many were\r\ndisposed to pay her, with grace and affability, but at heart with\r\nimperial indifference, he ceased to disturb himself; for, as she\r\nrightly thought, he was incapable of understanding her. A coquette he\r\ncould have interpreted; but a romantic character like hers, born for a\r\ngrand passion, or no love at all, he could not. Nor did he see that\r\nV---- was likely to be more to her than any of her admirers.\r\n\r\n_Laurie._ I am afraid I should have shamed his obtuseness. V----\r\nhas nothing to recommend him that I know of, except his beauty, and\r\nthat is the beauty of a _petit-maitre_--effeminate, without\r\ncharacter, and very unlikely, I should judge, to attract such a woman\r\nas you give me the idea of.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron._ You speak like a man, Laurie; but have you never\r\nheard tales of youthful minstrels and pages being preferred by\r\nprincesses, in the land of chivalry, to stalwart knights, who were\r\nriding all over the land, doing their devoirs maugre scars and\r\nstarvation? And why? One want of a woman's heart is to admire and be\r\nprotected; but another is to be understood in all her delicate\r\nfeelings, and have an object who shall know how to receive all the\r\nmarks of her inventive and bounteous affection. V---- is such an one;\r\na being of infinite grace and tenderness, and an equal capacity for\r\nprizing the same in another.\r\n\r\nEffeminate, say you? Lovely, rather, and lovable. He was not, indeed,\r\nmade to grow old; but I never saw a fairer spring-time than shone in\r\nhis eye when life, and thought, and love, opened on him all together.\r\n\r\nHe was to Emily like the soft breathing of a flute in some solitary\r\nvalley; indeed, the delicacy of his nature made a solitude around him\r\nin the world. So delicate was he, and Emily for a long time so\r\nunconscious, that nobody except myself divined how strong was the\r\nattraction which, as it drew them nearer together, invested both with\r\na lustre and a sweetness which charmed all around them.\r\n\r\nBut I see the sun is declining, and warns me to cut short a tale which\r\nwould keep us here till dawn if I were to detail it as I should like\r\nto do in my own memories. The progress of this affair interested me\r\ndeeply; for, like all persons whose perceptions are more lively than\r\ntheir hopes, I delight to live from day to day in the more ardent\r\nexperiments of others. I looked on with curiosity, with sympathy, with\r\nfear. How could it end? What would become of them, unhappy lovers? One\r\ntoo noble, the other too delicate, ever to find happiness in an\r\nunsanctioned tie.\r\n\r\nI had, however, no right to interfere, and did not, even by a look,\r\nuntil one evening, when the occasion was forced upon me.\r\n\r\nThere was a summer fete given at L----'s. I had mingled for a while\r\nwith the guests in the brilliant apartments; but the heat oppressed,\r\nthe conversation failed to interest me. An open window tempted me to\r\nthe garden, whose flowers and tufted lawns lay bathed in moonlight. I\r\nwent out alone; but the music of a superb band followed my steps, and\r\ngave impulse to my thoughts. A dreaming state, pensive though not\r\nabsolutely sorrowful, came upon me,--one of those gentle moods when\r\nthoughts flow through the mind amber-clear and soft, noiseless,\r\nbecause unimpeded. I sat down in an arbor to enjoy it, and probably\r\nstayed much longer than I could have imagined; for when I reentered\r\nthe large saloon it was deserted. The lights, however, were not\r\nextinguished, and, hearing voices in the inner room, I supposed some\r\nguests still remained; and, as I had not spoken with Emily that\r\nevening, I ventured in to bid her good-night. I started, repentant, on\r\nfinding her alone with V----, and in a situation that announced their\r\nfeelings to be no longer concealed from each other. She, leaning back\r\non the sofa, was weeping bitterly, while V----, seated at her feet,\r\nholding her hands within his own, was pouring forth his passionate\r\nwords with a fervency which prevented him from perceiving my entrance.\r\nBut Emily perceived me at once, and starting up, motioned me not to\r\ngo, as I had intended. I obeyed, and sat down. A pause ensued, awkward\r\nfor me and for V----, who sat with his eyes cast down and blushing\r\nlike a young girl detected in a burst of feeling long kept secret.\r\nEmily sat buried in thought, the tears yet undried upon her cheeks.\r\nShe was pale, but nobly beautiful, as I had never yet seen her.\r\n\r\nAfter a few moments I broke the silence, and attempted to tell why I\r\nhad returned so late. She interrupted me: \"No matter, Aglauron, how it\r\nhappened; whatever the chance, it promises to give both V---- and\r\nmyself, what we greatly need, a calm friend and adviser. You are the\r\nonly person among these crowds of men whom I could consult; for I have\r\nread friendship in your eye, and I know you have truth and honor.\r\nV---- thinks of you as I do, and he too is, or should be, glad to have\r\nsome counsellor beside his own wishes.\"\r\n\r\nV---- did not raise his eyes; neither did he contradict her. After a\r\nmoment he said, \"I believe Aglauron to be as free from prejudice as\r\nany man, and most true and honorable; yet who can judge in this matter\r\nbut ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one shall judge,\" said Emily; \"but I want counsel. God help me! I\r\nfeel there is a right and wrong; but how can my mind, which has never\r\nbeen trained to discern between them, be confident of its power at\r\nthis important moment? Aglauron, what remains to me of happiness,--if\r\nanything do remain; perhaps the hope of heaven, if, indeed, there be a\r\nheaven,--is at stake! Father and brother have failed their trust. I\r\nhave no friend able to understand, wise enough to counsel me. The only\r\none whose words ever came true to my thoughts, and of whom you have\r\noften reminded me, is distant. Will you, this hour, take her place?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the best of my ability,\" I replied without hesitation, struck by\r\nthe dignity of her manner.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" she said, \"all my past history; all do so here, though\r\nthey do not talk loudly of it. You and all others have probably blamed\r\nme. You know not, you cannot guess, the anguish, the struggles of my\r\nchildish mind when it first opened to the meaning of those words,\r\nLove, Marriage, Life. When I was bound to Mr. L----, by a vow which\r\nfrom my heedless lips was mockery of all thought, all holiness, I had\r\nnever known a duty, I had never felt the pressure of a tie. Life had\r\nbeen, so far, a sweet, voluptuous dream, and I thought of this\r\nseemingly so kind and amiable person as a new and devoted ministrant\r\nto me of its pleasures. But I was scarcely in his power when I awoke.\r\nI perceived the unfitness of the tie; its closeness revolted me.\r\n\r\n\"I had no timidity; I had always been accustomed to indulge my\r\nfeelings, and I displayed them now. L----, irritated, averted his\r\nmastery; this drove me wild; I soon hated him, and despised too his\r\ninsensibility to all which I thought most beautiful. From all his\r\nfaults, and the imperfection of our relation, grew up in my mind the\r\nknowledge of what the true might be to me. It is astonishing how the\r\nthought grow upon me day by day. I had not been married more than\r\nthree months before I knew what it would be to love, and I longed to\r\nbe free to do so. I had never known what it was to be resisted, and\r\nthe thought never came to me that I could now, and for all my life, be\r\nbound by so early a mistake. I thought only of expressing my resolve\r\nto be free.\r\n\r\n\"How I was repulsed, how disappointed, you know, or could divine if\r\nyou did not know; for all but me have been trained to bear the burden\r\nfrom their youth up, and accustomed to have the individual will\r\nfettered for the advantage of society. For the same reason, you cannot\r\nguess the silent fury that filled my mind when I at last found that I\r\nhad struggled in vain, and that I must remain in the bondage that I\r\nhad ignorantly put on.\r\n\r\n\"My affections were totally alienated from my family, for I felt they\r\nhad known what I had not, and had neither put me on my guard, nor\r\nwarned me against precipitation whose consequences must be fatal. I\r\nsaw, indeed, that they did not look on life as I did, and could be\r\ncontent without being happy; but this observation was far from making\r\nme love them more. I felt alone, bitterly, contemptuously alone. I\r\nhated men who had made the laws that bound me. I did not believe in\r\nGod; for why had He permitted the dart to enter so unprepared a\r\nbreast? I determined never to submit, though I disdained to struggle,\r\nsince struggle was in vain. In passive, lonely wretchedness I would\r\npass my days. I would not feign what I did not feel, nor take the hand\r\nwhich had poisoned for me the cup of life before I had sipped the\r\nfirst drops.\r\n\r\n\"A friend--the only one I have ever known--taught me other thoughts.\r\nShe taught me that others, perhaps all others, were victims, as much\r\nas myself. She taught me that if all the wrecked submitted to be\r\ndrowned, the world would be a desert. She taught me to pity others,\r\neven those I myself was paining; for she showed me that they had\r\nsinned in ignorance, and that I had no right to make them suffer so\r\nlong as I myself did, merely because they were the authors of my\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\n\"She showed me, by her own pure example, what were Duty and\r\nBenevolence and Employment to the soul, even when baffled and sickened\r\nin its dearest wishes. That example was not wholly lost: I freed my\r\nparents, at least, from their pain, and, without falsehood, became\r\nless cruel and more calm.\r\n\r\n\"Yet the kindness, the calmness, have never gone deep. I have been\r\nforced to live out of myself; and life, busy or idle, is still most\r\nbitter to the homeless heart. I cannot be like Almeria; I am more\r\nardent; and, Aglauron, you see now I might be happy,\"\r\n\r\nShe looked towards V----. I followed her eye, and was well-nigh melted\r\ntoo by the beauty of his gaze.\r\n\r\n\"The question in my mind is,\" she resumed, \"have I not a right to fly?\r\nTo leave this vacant life, and a tie which, but for worldly\r\ncircumstances, presses as heavily on L---- as on myself. I shall\r\nmortify him; but that is a trifle compared with actual misery. I shall\r\ngrieve my parents; but, were they truly such, would they not grieve\r\nstill more that I must reject the life of mutual love? I have already\r\nsacrificed enough; shall I sacrifice the happiness of one I could\r\nreally bless for those who do not know one native heart-beat of my\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\nV---- kissed her hand.\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" said she, sighing, \"it does not always look so. We must, in\r\nthat case, leave the world; it will not tolerate us. Can I make V----\r\nhappy in solitude? And what would Almeria think? Often it seems that\r\nshe would feel that now I do love, and could make a green spot in the\r\ndesert of life over which she mourned, she would rejoice to have me do\r\nso. Then, again, something whispers she might have objections to make;\r\nand I wish--O, I long to know them! For I feel that this is the great\r\ncrisis of my life, and that if I do not act wisely, now that I have\r\nthought and felt, it will be unpardonable. In my first error I was\r\nignorant what I wished, but now I know, and ought not to be weak or\r\ndeluded.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Have you no religious scruples? Do you never think of your\r\nvow as sacred?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" she replied, with flashing eyes. \"Shall the woman be bound by\r\nthe folly of the child? No!--have never once considered myself as\r\nL----'s wife. If I have lived in his house, it was to make the best of\r\nwhat was left, as Almeria advised. But what I feel he knows perfectly.\r\nI have never deceived him. But O! I hazard all! all! and should I be\r\nagain ignorant, again deceived\"----\r\n\r\nV---- here poured forth all that can be imagined.\r\n\r\nI rose: \"Emily, this case seems to me so extraordinary that I must\r\nhave time to think. You shall hear from me. I shall certainly give you\r\nmy best advice, and I trust you will not over-value it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" she said, \"it will be of use to me, and will enable me to\r\ndecide what I shall do.   V----, now go away with Aglauron; it is too\r\nlate for you to stay here.\"\r\n\r\nI do not know if I have made obvious, in this account, what struck me\r\nmost in the interview,--a certain savage force in the character of\r\nthis beautiful woman, quite independent of the reasoning power. I saw\r\nthat, as she could give no account of the past, except that she saw it\r\nwas fit, or saw it was not, so she must be dealt with now by a strong\r\ninstalment made by another from his own point of view, which she would\r\naccept or not, as suited her.\r\n\r\nThere are some such characters, which, like plants, stretch upwards to\r\nthe light; they accept what nourishes, they reject what injures them.\r\nThey die if wounded,--blossom if fortunate; but never learn to analyze\r\nall this, or find its reasons; but, if they tell their story, it is in\r\nEmily's way;--\"it was so;\" \"I found it so.\"\r\n\r\nI talked with V----, and found him, as I expected, not the peer of her\r\nhe loved, except in love. His passion was at its height. Better\r\nacquainted with the world than Emily,--not because he had seen it\r\nmore, but because he had the elements of the citizen in him,--he had\r\nbeen at first equally emboldened and surprised by the ease with which\r\nhe won her to listen to his suit. But he was soon still more surprised\r\nto find that she would only listen. She had no regard for her position\r\nin society as a married woman,--none for her vow. She frankly\r\nconfessed her love, so far as it went, but doubted as to whether it\r\nwas _her whole love_, and doubted still more her right to leave\r\nL----, since she had returned to him, and could not break the bond so\r\nentirely as to give them firm foot-hold in the world.\r\n\r\n\"I may make you unhappy,\" she said, \"and then be unhappy myself; these\r\nlaws, this society, are so strange, I can make nothing of them. In\r\nmusic I am at home. Why is not all life music? We instantly know when\r\nwe are going wrong there. Convince me it is for the best, and I will\r\ngo with you at once. But now it seems wrong, unwise, scarcely better\r\nthan to stay as we are. We must go secretly, must live obscurely in a\r\ncorner. That I cannot bear,--all is wrong yet. Why am I not at liberty\r\nto declare unblushingly to all men that I will leave the man whom I\r\n_do not_ love, and go with him I _do_ love? That is the only\r\nway that would suit me,--I cannot see clearly to take any other\r\ncourse.\"\r\n\r\nI found V---- had no scruples of conscience, any more than herself. He\r\nwas wholly absorbed in his passion, and his only wish was to persuade\r\nher to elope, that a divorce might follow, and she be all his own.\r\n\r\nI took my part. I wrote next day to Emily. I told her that my view\r\nmust differ from hers in this: that I had, from early impressions, a\r\nfeeling of the sanctity of the marriage vow. It was not to me a\r\nmeasure intended merely to insure the happiness of two individuals,\r\nbut a solemn obligation, which, whether it led to happiness or not,\r\nwas a means of bringing home to the mind the great idea of Duty, the\r\nunderstanding of which, and not happiness, seemed to be the end of\r\nlife. Life looked not clear to me otherwise. I entreated her to\r\nseparate herself from V---- for a year, before doing anything\r\ndecisive; she could then look at the subject from other points of\r\nview, and see the bearing on mankind as well as on herself alone.   If\r\nshe still found that happiness and V---- were her chief objects, she\r\nmight be more sure of herself after such a trial. I was careful not to\r\nadd one word of persuasion or exhortation, except that I recommended\r\nher to the enlightening love of the Father of our spirits.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. With or without persuasion, your advice had small\r\nchance, I fear, of being followed.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. You err. Next day V---- departed. Emily, with a calm\r\nbrow and earnest eyes, devoted herself to thought, and such reading as\r\nI suggested.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. And the result?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. I grieve not to be able to point my tale with the\r\nexpected moral, though perhaps the true denouement may lead to one as\r\nvaluable. L---- died within the year, and she married V----.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. And the result?\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. Is for the present utter disappointment in him. She\r\nwas infinitely blest, for a time, in his devotion, but presently her\r\nstrong nature found him too much hers, and too little his own. He\r\nsatisfied her as little as L---- had done, though always lovely and\r\ndear. She saw with keen anguish, though this time without bitterness,\r\nthat we are never wise enough to be sure any measure will fulfil our\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nBut--I know not how it is--Emily does not yet command the changes of\r\ndestiny which she feels so keenly and faces so boldly. Born to be\r\nhappy only in the clear light of religious thought, she still seeks\r\nhappiness elsewhere. She is now a mother, and all other thoughts are\r\nmerged in that. But she will not long be permitted to abide there. One\r\nmore pang, and I look to see her find her central point, from which\r\nall the paths she has taken lead. She loves truth so ardently, though\r\nas yet only in detail, that she will yet know truth as a whole. She\r\nwill see that she does not live for Emily, or for V----, or for her\r\nchild, but as one link in a divine purpose. Her large nature must at\r\nlast serve knowingly.\r\n\r\n_Myself_. I cannot understand you, Aglauron; I do not guess the\r\nscope of your story, nor sympathize with your feeling about this lady.\r\nShe is a strange, and, I think, very unattractive person. I think her\r\nbeauty must have fascinated you. Her character seems very\r\ninconsistent.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. Because I have drawn from life.\r\n\r\n_Myself_. But, surely, there should be a harmony somewhere.\r\n\r\n_Aglauron_. Could we but get the right point of view.\r\n\r\n_Laurie_. And where is that?\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the sun, just sinking behind the pine grove. We mounted\r\nand rode home without a word more. But I do not understand Aglauron\r\nyet, nor what he expects from this Emily. Yet her character, though\r\nalmost featureless at first, gains distinctness as I think of it more.\r\nPerhaps in this life I shall find its key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WRONGS OF AMERICAN WOMEN. THE DUTY OF AMERICAN WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same day brought us a copy of Mr. Burdett's little book,--in which\r\nthe sufferings and difficulties that beset the large class of women\r\nwho must earn their subsistence in a city like New York, are\r\ndelineated with so much simplicity, feeling, and exact adherence to\r\nthe facts,--and a printed circular, containing proposals for immediate\r\npractical adoption of the plan wore fully described in a book\r\npublished some weeks since, under the title, \"The Duty of American\r\nWomen to their Country,\" which was ascribed alternately to Mrs. Stowe\r\nand Miss Catharine Beecher. The two matters seemed linked to one\r\nanother by natural parity. Full acquaintance with the wrong must call\r\nforth all manner of inventions for its redress.\r\n\r\nThe circular, in showing the vast want that already exists of good\r\nmeans for instructing the children of this nation, especially in the\r\nWest, states also the belief that among women, as being less immersed\r\nin other cares and toils, from the preparation it gives for their task\r\nas mothers, and from the necessity in which a great proportion stand\r\nof earning a subsistence somehow, at least during the years which\r\nprecede marriage, if they _do_ marry, must the number of teachers\r\nwanted be found, which is estimated already at _sixty thousand_.\r\n\r\nWe cordially sympathize with these views.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written about woman's keeping within her sphere, which\r\nis defined as the domestic sphere. As a little girl she is to learn\r\nthe lighter family duties, while she acquires that limited\r\nacquaintance with the realm of literature and science that will enable\r\nher to superintend the instruction of children in their earliest\r\nyears. It is not generally proposed that she should be sufficiently\r\ninstructed and developed to understand the pursuits or aims of her\r\nfuture husband; she is not to be a help-meet to him in the way of\r\ncompanionship and counsel, except in the care of his house and\r\nchildren. Her youth is to be passed partly in learning to keep house\r\nand the use of the needle, partly in the social circle, where her\r\nmanners may be formed, ornamental accomplishments perfected and\r\ndisplayed, and the husband found who shall give her the domestic\r\nsphere for which she is exclusively to be prepared.\r\n\r\nWere the destiny of Woman thus exactly marked out; did she invariably\r\nretain the shelter of a parent's or guardian's roof till she married;\r\ndid marriage give her a sure home and protector; were she never liable\r\nto remain a widow, or, if so, sure of finding immediate protection\r\nfrom a brother or new husband, so that she might never be forced to\r\nstand alone one moment; and were her mind given for this world only,\r\nwith no faculties capable of eternal growth and infinite improvement;\r\nwe would still demand for her a for wider and more generous culture,\r\nthan is proposed by those who so anxiously define her sphere. We would\r\ndemand it that she might not ignorantly or frivolously thwart the\r\ndesigns of her husband; that she might be the respected friend of her\r\nsons, not less than of her daughters; that she might give more\r\nrefinement, elevation and attraction, to the society which is needed\r\nto give the characters of _men_ polish and plasticity,--no less\r\nso than to save them from vicious and sensual habits. But the most\r\nfastidious critic on the departure of Woman from her sphere can\r\nscarcely fail to see, at present, that a vast proportion of the sex,\r\nif not the better half, do not, _cannot_ have this domestic\r\nsphere. Thousands and scores of thousands in this country, no less\r\nthan in Europe, are obliged to maintain themselves alone. Far greater\r\nnumbers divide with their husbands the care of earning a support for\r\nthe family. In England, now, the progress of society has reached so\r\nadmirable a pitch, that the position of the sexes is frequently\r\nreversed, and the husband is obliged to stay at home and \"mind the\r\nhouse and bairns,\" while the wife goes forth to the employment she\r\nalone can secure.\r\n\r\nWe readily admit that the picture of this is most painful;--that\r\nNature made an entirely opposite distribution of functions between the\r\nsexes. We believe the natural order to be the best, and that, if it\r\ncould be followed in an enlightened spirit, it would bring to Woman\r\nall she wants, no less for her immortal than her mortal destiny. We\r\nare not surprised that men who do not look deeply and carefully at\r\ncauses and tendencies, should be led, by disgust at the hardened,\r\nhackneyed characters which the present state of things too often\r\nproduces in women, to such conclusions as they are. We, no more than\r\nthey, delight in the picture of the poor woman digging in the mines in\r\nher husband's clothes. We, no more than they, delight to hear their\r\nvoices shrilly raised in the market-place, whether of apples, or of\r\ncelebrity. But we see that at present they must do as they do for\r\nbread. Hundreds and thousands must step out of that hallowed domestic\r\nsphere, with no choice but to work or steal, or belong to men, not as\r\nwives, but as the wretched slaves of sensuality.\r\n\r\nAnd this transition state, with all its revolting features, indicates,\r\nwe do believe, an approach of a nobler era than the world has yet\r\nknown. We trust that by the stress and emergencies of the present and\r\ncoming time the minds of women will be formed to more reflection and\r\nhigher purposes than heretofore; their latent powers developed, their\r\ncharacters strengthened and eventually beautified and harmonized.\r\nShould the state of society then be such that each may remain, as\r\nNature seems to have intended, Woman the tutelary genius of home,\r\nwhile Man manages the outdoor business of life, both may be done with\r\na wisdom, a mutual understanding and respect, unknown at present. Men\r\nwill be no less gainers by this than women, finding in pure and more\r\nreligious marriages the joys of friendship and love combined,--in\r\ntheir mothers and daughters better instruction, sweeter and nobler\r\ncompanionship, and in society at large, an excitement to their finer\r\npowers and feelings unknown at present, except in the region of the\r\nfine arts.\r\n\r\nBlest be the generous, the wise, who seek to forward hopes like these,\r\ninstead of struggling, against the fiat of Providence and the march of\r\nFate, to bind down rushing life to the standard of the past! Such\r\nefforts are vain, but those who make them are unhappy and unwise.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, to such that we address ourselves, but to those\r\nwho seek to make the best of things as they are, while they also\r\nstrive to make them better. Such persons will have seen enough of the\r\nstate of things in London, Paris, New York, and manufacturing regions\r\neverywhere, to feel that there is an imperative necessity for opening\r\nmore avenues of employment to women, and fitting them better to enter\r\nthem, rather than keeping them back.\r\n\r\nWomen have invaded many of the trades and some of the professions.\r\nSewing, to the present killing extent, they cannot long bear.\r\nFactories seem likely to afford them permanent employment. In the\r\nculture of fruit, flowers, and vegetables, even in the sale of them,\r\nwe rejoice to see them engaged. In domestic service they will be\r\naided, but can never be supplanted, by machinery. As much room as\r\nthere is here for Woman's mind and Woman's labor, will always be\r\nfilled. A few have usurped the martial province, but these must always\r\nbe few; the nature of Woman is opposed to war. It is natural enough to\r\nsee \"female physicians,\" and we believe that the lace cap and work-bag\r\nare as much at home here as the wig and gold-headed cane. In the\r\npriesthood, they have, from all time, shared more or less--in many\r\neras more than at the present. We believe there has been no female\r\nlawyer, and probably will be none. The pen, many of the fine arts,\r\nthey have made their own; and in the more refined countries of the\r\nworld, as writers, as musicians, as painters, as actors, women occupy\r\nas advantageous ground as men. Writing and music may be esteemed\r\nprofessions for them more than any other.\r\n\r\nBut there are two others--where the demand must invariably be immense,\r\nand for which they are naturally better fitted than men--for which we\r\nshould like to see them better prepared and better rewarded than they\r\nare. These are the professions of nurse to the sick, and of the\r\nteacher. The first of these professions we have warmly desired to see\r\ndignified. It is a noble one, now most unjustly regarded in the light\r\nof menial service. It is one which no menial, no servile nature can\r\nfitly occupy. We were rejoiced when an intelligent lady of\r\nMassachusetts made the refined heroine of a little romance select this\r\ncalling. This lady (Mrs. George Lee) has looked on society with\r\nunusual largeness of spirit and healthiness of temper. She is well\r\nacquainted with the world of conventions, but sees beneath it the\r\nworld of nature. She is a generous writer, and unpretending as the\r\ngenerous are wont to be. We do not recall the name of the tale, but\r\nthe circumstance above mentioned marks its temper. We hope to see the\r\ntime when the refined and cultivated will choose this profession, and\r\nlearn it, not only through experience and under the direction of the\r\ndoctor, but by acquainting themselves with the laws of matter and of\r\nmind, so that all they do shall be intelligently done, and afford them\r\nthe means of developing intelligence, as well as the nobler, tenderer\r\nfeelings of humanity; for even this last part of the benefit they\r\ncannot receive if their work be done in a selfish or mercenary spirit.\r\n\r\nThe other profession is that of teacher, for which women are\r\npeculiarly adapted by their nature, superiority in tact, quickness of\r\nsympathy, gentleness, patience, and a clear and animated manner in\r\nnarration or description. To form a good teacher, should be added to\r\nthis, sincere modesty combined with firmness, liberal views, with a\r\npower and will to liberalize them still further, a good method, and\r\nhabits of exact and thorough investigation. In the two last requisites\r\nwomen are generally deficient, but there are now many shining examples\r\nto prove that if they are immethodical and superficial as teachers,\r\nit is because it is the custom so to teach them, and that when aware\r\nof these faults, they can and will correct them.\r\n\r\nThe profession is of itself an excellent one for the improvement of\r\nthe teacher during that interim between youth and maturity when the\r\nmind needs testing, tempering, and to review and rearrange the\r\nknowledge it has acquired. The natural method of doing this for one's\r\nself, is to attempt teaching others; those years also are the best of\r\nthe practical teacher. The teacher should be near the pupil, both in\r\nyears and feelings; no oracle, but the eldest brother or sister of the\r\npupil. More experience and years form the lecturer and director of\r\nstudies, but injure the powers as to familiar teaching.\r\n\r\nThese are just the years of leisure in the lives even of those women\r\nwho are to enter the domestic sphere, and this calling most of all\r\ncompatible with a constant progress as to qualifications for that.\r\n\r\nViewing the matter thus, it may well be seen that we should hail with\r\njoy the assurance that sixty thousand _female_ teachers are\r\nwanted, and more likely to be, and that a plan is projected which\r\nlooks wise, liberal and generous, to afford the means, to those whose\r\nhearts answer to this high calling, of obeying their dictates.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to have Cincinnati as a central point, where teachers\r\nshall be for a short time received, examined, and prepared for their\r\nduties. By mutual agreement and cooperation of the various sects,\r\nfunds are to be raised, and teachers provided, according to the wants\r\nand tendencies of the various locations now destitute. What is to be\r\ndone for them centrally, is for suitable persons to examine into the\r\nvarious kinds of fitness, communicate some general views whose value\r\nhas been tested, and counsel adapted to the difficulties and\r\nadvantages of their new positions. The central committee are to have\r\nthe charge of raising funds, and finding teachers, and places where\r\nteachers are wanted.\r\n\r\nThe passage of thoughts, teachers and funds, will be from East to\r\nWest--the course of sunlight upon this earth.\r\n\r\nThe plan is offered as the most extensive and pliant means of doing a\r\ngood and preventing ill to this nation, by means of a national\r\neducation; whose normal school shall have an invariable object in the\r\nsearch after truth, and the diffusion of the means of knowledge, while\r\nits form shall be plastic according to the wants of the time. This\r\nnormal school promises to have good effects, for it proposes worthy\r\naims through simple means, and the motive for its formation and\r\nsupport seems to be disinterested philanthropy.\r\n\r\nIt promises to eschew the bitter spirit of sectarianism and\r\nproselytism, else we, for one party, could have nothing to do with it.\r\nMen, no doubt, have oftentimes been kept from absolute famine by the\r\nwheat with which such tares are mingled; but we believe the time is\r\ncome when a purer and more generous food is to be offered to the\r\npeople at large. We believe the aim of all education to be to rouse\r\nthe mind to action, show it the means of discipline and of\r\ninformation; then leave it free, with God, Conscience, and the love of\r\nTruth, for its guardians and teachers. Woe be to those who sacrifice\r\nthese aims of universal and eternal value to the propagation of a set\r\nof opinions! We can accept such doctrine as is offered by Rev. Colvin\r\nE. Stowe, one of the committee, in the following passage:\r\n\r\n\"In judicious practice, I am persuaded there will seldom be any very\r\ngreat difficulty, especially if there be excited in the community\r\nanything like a whole-hearted and enlightened sincerity in the cause\r\nof public instruction.\r\n\r\n\"It is all right for people to suit their own taste and convictions in\r\nrespect to sect; and by fair means, and at proper times, to teach\r\ntheir children and those under their influence to prefer the\r\ndenominations which they prefer; but further than this no one has any\r\nright to go. It is all wrong to hazard the well-being of the soul, to\r\njeopardize great public interests for the sake of advancing the\r\ninterests of a sect. People must learn to practise some self-denial,\r\non Christian principles, in respect to their denominational prejudices\r\nas well as in respect to other things, before pure religion can ever\r\ngain a complete victory over every form of human selfishness.\"\r\n\r\nThe persons who propose themselves to the examination and instruction\r\nof the teachers at Cincinnati, till the plan shall be sufficiently\r\nunder way to provide regularly for the office, are Mrs. Stowe and Miss\r\nCatharine Beecher, ladies well known to fame, as possessing unusual\r\nqualifications for the task.\r\n\r\nAs to finding abundance of teachers, who that reads this little book\r\nof Mr. Burdett's, or the account of the compensation of female labor\r\nin New York, and the hopeless, comfortless, useless, pernicious lives\r\nof those who have even the advantage of getting work must lead, with\r\nthe sufferings and almost inevitable degradation to which those who\r\ncannot are exposed, but must long to snatch such as are capable of\r\nthis better profession (and among the multitude there must be many who\r\nare or could be made so) from their present toils, and make them free,\r\nand the means of freedom and growth in others?\r\n\r\nTo many books on such subjects--among others to \"Woman in the\r\nNineteenth Century\"--the objection has been made, that they exhibit\r\nills without specifying any practical means for their remedy. The\r\nwriter of the last-named essay does indeed think that it contains one\r\ngreat rule which, if laid to heart, would prove a practical remedy for\r\nmany ills, and of such daily and hourly efficacy in the conduct of\r\nlife, that any extensive observance of it for a single year would\r\nperceptibly raise the tone of thought, feeling and conduct, throughout\r\nthe civilized world. But to those who ask not only such a principle,\r\nbut an external method for immediate use, we say that here is one\r\nproposed which looks noble and promising; the proposers offer\r\nthemselves to the work with heart and hand, with time and purse. Go ye\r\nand do likewise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first knew George Sand, I thought to have found tried the\r\nexperiment I wanted. I did not value Bettine so much. She had not\r\npride enough for me. Only now, when I am sure of myself, can I pour\r\nout my soul at the feet of another. In the assured soul it is kingly\r\nprodigality; in one which cannot forbear it is mere babyhood. I love\r\n\"abandon\" only when natures are capable of the extreme reverse. I know\r\nBettine would end in nothing; when I read her book I knew she could\r\nnot outlive her love.\r\n\r\nBut in _\"Les Sept Cordes de la Lyre,\"_ which I read first, I saw\r\nthe knowledge of the passions and of social institutions, with the\r\ncelestial choice which rose above them. I loved Helene, who could hear\r\nso well the terrene voices, yet keep her eye fixed on the stars. That\r\nwould be my wish also,--to know all, and then choose. I even revered\r\nher, for I was not sure that I could have resisted the call of the\r\n_now_; could have left the spirit and gone to God; and at a more\r\nambitious age I could not have refused the philosopher. But I hoped\r\nmuch from her steadfastness, and I thought I heard the last tones of a\r\npurified life. Gretchen, in the golden cloud, is raised above all past\r\ndelusions, worthy to redeem and upbear the wise man who stumbled into\r\nthe pit of error while searching for truth.\r\n\r\nStill, in \"Andre\" and \"Jacques,\" I trace the same high morality of one\r\nwho had tried the liberty of circumstance only to learn to appreciate\r\nthe liberty of law;--to know that license is the foe of freedom; and,\r\nthough the sophistry of Passion in these books disgusted me, flowers\r\nof purest hue seemed to grow upon the dark and dirty ground. I thought\r\nshe had cast aside the slough of her past life, and begun a new\r\nexistence beneath the sun of a new ideal.\r\n\r\nBut here, in the _\"Lettres d'un Voyageur,\"_ what do I see? An\r\nunfortunate, wailing her loneliness, wailing her mistakes, _writing\r\nfor money!_ She has genius, and a manly grasp of mind, but not a\r\nmanly heart. Will there never be a being to combine a man's mind and a\r\nwoman's heart, and who yet finds life too rich to weep over? Never?\r\n\r\nWhen I read in _\"Leon Leoni\"_ the account of the jeweller's\r\ndaughter's life with her mother, passed in dressing, and learning to\r\nbe looked at when dressed, _\"avec un front impassible,\"_ it\r\nreminded me of ---- and her mother. What a heroine she would be for\r\nSand! She has the same fearless softness with Juliet, and a sportive\r\n_naivete_ a mixture of bird and kitten, unknown to the dupe of\r\nLeoni.\r\n\r\nIf I were a man, and wished a wife, as many do, merely as an ornament,\r\na silken toy, I would take ---- as soon as any I know. Her fantastic,\r\nimpassioned and mutable nature would yield an inexhaustible amusement.\r\nShe is capable of the most romantic actions,--wild as the falcon,\r\nvoluptuous as the tuberose; yet she has not in her the elements of\r\nromance, like a deeper or less susceptible nature. My cold and\r\nreasoning ----, with her one love lying, perhaps never to be unfolded,\r\nbeneath such sheaths of pride and reserve, would make a far better\r\nheroine.\r\n\r\n---- and her mother differ from Juliet and _her_ mother by the\r\nimpulse a single strong character gave them. Even at this distance of\r\ntime there is a light but perceptible taste of iron in the water.\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand disappoints me, as almost all beings do, especially since\r\nI have been brought close to her person by the _\"Lettres d'un\r\nVoyageur.\"_ Her remarks on Lavater seem really shallow, _a la\r\nmode du genre feminin._ No self-ruling Aspasia she, but a frail\r\nwoman, mourning over her lot. Any peculiarity in her destiny seems\r\naccidental; she is forced to this and to that to earn her bread,\r\nforsooth!\r\n\r\nYet her style--with what a deeply smouldering fire it burns! Not\r\nvehement, but intense, like Jean Jacques.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A NOTICE OF GEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probably known to a great proportion of readers that this writer\r\nis a woman, who writes under the name, and frequently assumes the\r\ndress and manners, of a man. It is also known that she has not only\r\nbroken the marriage-bond, and, since that, formed other connections,\r\nindependent of the civil and ecclesiastical sanction, but that she\r\nfirst rose into notice through works which systematically assailed the\r\npresent institution of marriage, and the social bonds which are\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\nNo facts are more adapted to startle every feeling of our community;\r\nbut, since the works of Sand are read here, notwithstanding, and\r\ncannot fail to be so while they exert so important an influence\r\nabroad, it would be well they should be read intelligently, as to the\r\ncircumstances of their birth and their tendency.\r\n\r\nGeorge Sand we esteem to be a person of strong passions, but of\r\noriginal nobleness and a love of right sufficient to guide them all to\r\nthe service of worthy aims. But she fell upon evil times. She was\r\ngiven in marriage, according to the fashion of the old regime; she was\r\ntaken from a convent, where she had heard a great deal about the law\r\nof God and the example of Jesus, into a society where no vice was\r\nproscribed, if it would only wear the cloak of hypocrisy. She found\r\nherself impatient of deception, and loudly appealed to by passion; she\r\nyielded, but she could not do so, as others did, sinning against what\r\nshe owned to be the rule of right and the will of Heaven. She\r\nprotested, she examined, she \"hacked into the roots of things,\" and\r\nthe bold sound of her axe called around her every foe that finds a\r\nhome amid the growths of civilization. Still she persisted. \"If it be\r\nreal,\" thought she, \"it cannot be destroyed; as to what is false, the\r\nsooner it goes the better; and I, for one, would rather perish by its\r\nfall, than wither in its shade.\"\r\n\r\nSchiller puts into the mouth of Mary Stuart these words, as her only\r\nplea: \"The world knows the worst of me, and I may boast that, though I\r\nhave erred, I am better than my reputation.\" Sand may say the same.\r\nAll is open, noble; the free descriptions, the sophistry of passion,\r\nare, at least, redeemed by a desire for truth as strong as ever beat\r\nin any heart. To the weak or unthinking, the reading of such books may\r\nnot be desirable, for only those who take exercise as men can digest\r\nstrong meat. But to any one able to understand the position and\r\ncircumstances, we believe this reading cannot fail of bringing good\r\nimpulses, valuable suggestions; and it is quite free from that subtle\r\nmiasma which taints so large a portion of French literature, not less\r\nsince the Revolution than before. This we say to the foreign reader.\r\nTo her own country, Sand is a boon precious and prized, both as a\r\nwarning and a leader, for which none there can be ungrateful. She has\r\ndared to probe its festering wounds; and if they be not past all\r\nsurgery, she is one who, most of any, helps towards a cure.\r\n\r\nWould, indeed, the surgeon had come with quite clean hands! A woman of\r\nSand's genius--as free, as bold, and pure from even the suspicion of\r\nerror--might have filled an apostolic station among her people with\r\nwhat force had come her cry, \"If it be false, give it up; but if it be\r\ntrue, keep to it,-- one or the other!\"\r\n\r\nBut we have read all we wish to say upon this subject lately uttered\r\njust from the quarter we could wish. It is such a woman, so\r\nunblemished in character, so high in aim, so pure in soul, that should\r\naddress this other, as noble in nature, but clouded by error, and\r\nstruggling with circumstances. It is such women that will do such\r\nothers justice. They are not afraid to look for virtue, and reply to\r\naspiration, among those who have _not_ dwelt \"in decencies\r\nforever.\" It is a source of pride and happiness to read this address\r\nfrom the heart of Elizabeth Barrett:--\r\n\r\n  TO GEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\n  A DESIRE.\r\n\r\n  Thou large-brained woman and large-hearted man,\r\n    Self-called George Sand! whose soul amid the lions\r\n    Of thy tumultuous senses moans defiance,\r\n  And answers roar for roar, as spirits can,--\r\n  I would some wild, miraculous thunder ran\r\n    Above the applauding circus, in appliance\r\n    Of thine own nobler nature's strength and science,\r\n  Drawing two pinions, white as wings of swan,\r\n  From the strong shoulders, to amaze the place\r\n    With holier light! That thou, to woman's claim,\r\n  And man's, might join, beside, the angel's grace\r\n    Of a pure genius, sanctified from blame,\r\n  Till child and maiden pressed to thine embrace,\r\n    To kiss upon thy lips a stainless fame!\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *      *\r\n\r\n  TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n  A RECOGNITION.\r\n\r\n  True genius, but true woman! dost deny\r\n    Thy woman's nature with a manly scorn,\r\n    And break away the gauds and armlets worn\r\n  By weaker woman in captivity?\r\n  Ah, vain denial! that revolted cry\r\n  Is sobbed in by a woman's voice forlorn:--\r\n  Thy woman's hair, my sister! all unshorn,\r\n    Floats back dishevelled strength in agony,\r\n  Disproving thy man's name; and while before\r\n    The world thou burnest in a poet-fire,\r\n  We see thy woman-heart beat evermore\r\n    Through the large flame. Beat purer, heart! and higher,\r\n  Till God unsex thee on the spirit-shore,\r\n    To which, alone unsexing, purely aspire!\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis last sonnet seems to have been written after seeing the picture\r\nof Sand, which represents her in a man's dress, but with long, loose\r\nhair, and an eye whose mournful fire is impressive, even in the\r\ncaricatures.\r\n\r\nFor some years Sand has quitted her post of assailant. She has seen\r\nthat it is better to seek some form of life worthy to supersede the\r\nold, than rudely to destroy it, heedless of the future. Her force is\r\nbending towards philanthropic measures. She does not appear to possess\r\nmuch of the constructive faculty; and, though her writings command a\r\ngreat pecuniary compensation, and have a wide sway, it is rather for\r\ntheir tendency than for their thought. She has reached no commanding\r\npoint of view from which she may give orders to the advanced corps.\r\nShe is still at work with others in the breach, though she works with\r\nmore force than almost any.\r\n\r\nIn power, indeed, Sand bears the palm above all other French\r\nnovelists. She is vigorous in conception, often great in the\r\napprehension and the contrast of characters. She knows passion, as has\r\nbeen hinted, at a _white_ heat, when all the lower particles are\r\nremoulded by its power. Her descriptive talent is very great, and her\r\npoetic feeling exquisite. She wants but little of being a poet, but\r\nthat little is indispensable. Yet she keeps us always hovering on the\r\nborders of enchanted fields. She has, to a signal degree, that power\r\nof exact transcript from her own mind, in which almost all writers\r\nfail. There is no veil, no half-plastic integument between us and the\r\nthought; we vibrate perfectly with it.\r\n\r\nThis is her chief charm, and next to it is one in which we know no\r\nFrench writer that resembles her, except Rousseau, though he, indeed,\r\nis vastly her superior in it; that is, of concentrated glow. Her\r\nnature glows beneath the words, like fire beneath ashes,--deep, deep!\r\n\r\nHer best works are unequal; in many parts written hastily, or\r\ncarelessly, or with flagging spirits. They all promise far more than\r\nthey can perform; the work is not done masterly; she has not reached\r\nthat point where a writer sits at the helm of his own genius.\r\n\r\nSometimes she plies the oar,--sometimes she drifts. But what greatness\r\nshe has is genuine; there is no tinsel of any kind, no drapery\r\ncarefully adjusted, no chosen gesture about her. May Heaven lead her,\r\nat last, to the full possession of her best self, in harmony with the\r\nhigher laws of life!\r\n\r\nWe are not acquainted with all her works, but among those we know,\r\nmention \"_La Roche Maupart_,\" \"_Andre_,\" \"_Jacques_,\" \"_Les Sept Cordes\r\nde la Lyre_,\" and \"_Les Maitres Mosaistes_,\" as representing her higher\r\ninspirations, her sincerity in expression, and her dramatic powers.\r\nThey are full of faults; still they show her scope and aim with some\r\nfairness, which such of her readers as chance first on such of her books\r\nas \"_Leone Leoni_\" may fail to find; or even such as \"_Simon_,\" and\r\n\"_Spiridion_,\" though into the imperfect web of these are woven threads\r\nof pure gold. Such is the first impression made by the girl Fiamma, so\r\nnoble, as she appears before us with the words \"_E l'onore_;\" such the\r\nthought in _Spiridion_ of making the apparition the reward of virtue.\r\n\r\nThe work she is now publishing, \"_Consuelo_\" with its sequel,\r\n\"_Baroness de Rudolstadt_,\" exhibits her genius poised on a\r\nfirmer pedestal, breathing a serener air. Still it is faulty in\r\nconduct, and shows some obliquity of vision. She has not reached the\r\nInterpreter's house yet. But when she does, she will have clues to\r\nguide many a pilgrim, whom one less tried, less tempted than herself\r\ncould not help on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A CRITICISM ON \"CONSUELO.\"\r\n\r\n* * * * *. The work itself cannot fail of innumerable readers, and a\r\ngreat influence, for it counts many of the most significant pulse-beats\r\nof the tune. Apart from its range of character and fine descriptions,\r\nit records some of the mystical apparitions, and attempts to solve some\r\nof the problems of the time. How to combine the benefits of the\r\nreligious life with those of the artist-life in an existence more\r\nsimple, more full, more human in short, than either of the two\r\nhitherto known by these names has been,--this problem is but poorly\r\nsolved in the \"Countess of Rudolstadt,\" the sequel to Consuelo. It is\r\ntrue, as the English reviewer says, that George Sand is a far better\r\npoet than philosopher, and that the chief use she can be of in these\r\nmatters is, by her great range of observation and fine intuitions, to\r\nhelp to develop the thoughts of the time a little way further. But the\r\nsincerity, the reality of all he can obtain from this writer will be\r\nhighly valued by the earnest man.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the book is entirely successful--in showing how inward\r\npurity and honor may preserve a woman from bewilderment and danger,\r\nand secure her a genuine independence. Whoever aims at this is still\r\nconsidered, by unthinking or prejudiced minds, as wishing to despoil\r\nthe female character of its natural and peculiar loveliness. It is\r\nsupposed that delicacy must imply weakness, and that only an Amazon\r\ncan stand upright, and have sufficient command of her faculties to\r\nconfront the shock of adversity, or resist the allurements of\r\ntenderness. Miss Bremer, Dumas, and the northern novelist, Andersen,\r\nmake women who have a tendency to the intellectual life of an artist\r\nfail, and suffer the penalties of arrogant presumption, in the very\r\nfirst steps of a career to which an inward vocation called them in\r\npreference to the usual home duties. Yet nothing is more obvious than\r\nthat the circumstances of the time do, more and more frequently, call\r\nwomen to such lives, and that, if guardianship is absolutely necessary\r\nto women, many must perish for want of it. There is, then, reason to\r\nhope that God may be a sufficient guardian to those who dare rely on\r\nhim; and if the heroines of the novelists we have named ended as they\r\ndid, it was for the want of the purity of ambition and simplicity of\r\ncharacter which do not permit such as Consuelo to be either unseated\r\nand depraved, or unresisting victims and breaking reeds, if left alone\r\nin the storm and crowd of life. To many women this picture will prove\r\na true Consuelo (consolation), and we think even very prejudiced men\r\nwill not read it without being charmed with the expansion, sweetness\r\nand genuine force, of a female character, such as they have not met,\r\nbut must, when painted, recognize as possible, and may be led to\r\nreview their opinions, and perhaps to elevate and enlarge their hopes,\r\nas to \"Woman's sphere\" and \"Woman's mission.\" If such insist on what\r\nthey have heard of the private life of this writer, and refuse to\r\nbelieve that any good thing can come out of Nazareth, we reply that we\r\ndo not know the true facts as to the history of George Sand. There has\r\nbeen no memoir or notice of her published on which any one can rely,\r\nand we have seen too much of life to accept the monsters of gossip in\r\nreference to any one. But we know, through her works, that, whatever\r\nthe stains on her life and reputation may have been, there is in her a\r\nsoul so capable of goodness and honor as to depict them most\r\nsuccessfully in her ideal forms. It is her works, and not her private\r\nlife, that we are considering. Of her works we have means of judging;\r\nof herself, not. But among those who have passed unblamed through the\r\nwalks of life, we have not often found a nobleness of purpose and\r\nfeeling, a sincere religious hope, to be compared with the spirit that\r\nbreathes through the pages of Consuelo.\r\n\r\nThe experiences of the artist-life, the grand and penetrating remarks\r\nupon music, make the book a precious acquisition to all whose hearts\r\nare fashioned to understand such things.\r\n\r\nWe suppose that we receive here not only the mind of the writer, but\r\nof Liszt, with whom she has publicly corresponded in the \"_Lettres\r\nd'un Voyageur_.\" None could more avail us, for \"in him also is a\r\nspark of the divine fire,\" as Beethoven said of Ichubert. We may thus\r\nconsider that we have in this book the benefit of the most electric\r\nnature, the finest sensibility, and the boldest spirit of\r\ninvestigation combined, expressing themselves in a little world of\r\nbeautiful or picturesque forms.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are grave problems discussed, and sad and searching\r\nexperiences described in this work, yet its spirit is, in the main,\r\nhopeful, serene, almost glad. It is the spirit inspired from a near\r\nacquaintance with the higher life of art. Seeing there something\r\nreally achieved and completed, corresponding with the soul's desires,\r\nfaith is enlivened as to the eventual fulfilment of those desires, and\r\nwe feel a certainty that the existence which looks at present so\r\nmarred and fragmentary shall yet end in harmony. The shuttle is at\r\nwork, and the threads are gradually added that shall bring out the\r\npattern, and prove that what seems at present confusion is really the\r\nway and means to order and beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJENNY LIND,\r\n\r\nTHE \"CONSUELO\" OF GEORGE SAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nJenny Lind, the prima donna of Stockholm, is among the most\r\ndistinguished of those geniuses who have been invited to welcome the\r\nqueen to Germany. Her name has been unknown among us, as she is still\r\nyoung, and has not wandered much from the scene of her first triumphs;\r\nbut many may have seen, last winter, in the foreign papers, an account\r\nof her entrance into Stockholm after an absence of some length. The\r\npeople received her with loud cries of homage, took the horses from\r\nher carriage and drew her home; a tribute of respect often paid to\r\nconquerors and statesmen, but seldom, or, as far as we know, never to\r\nthe priesthood of the muses, who have conferred the higher benefit of\r\nraising, refining and exhilarating, the popular mind.\r\n\r\nAn accomplished Swede, now in this country, communicated to a friend\r\nparticulars of Jenny Lind's career, which suggested the thought that\r\nshe might have given the hint for the principal figure in Sand's late\r\nfamous novel, \"Consuelo.\"\r\n\r\nThis work is at present in process of translation in \"The Harbinger,\"\r\na periodical published at Brook Farm, Mass.; but, as this translation\r\nhas proceeded but a little way, and the book in its native tongue is\r\nnot generally, though it has been extensively, circulated here, we\r\nwill give a slight sketch of its plan.\r\n\r\nIt has been a work of deepest interest to those who have looked upon\r\nSand for some years back, as one of the best exponents of the\r\ndifficulties, the errors, the aspirations, the weaknesses, and the\r\nregenerative powers of the present epoch. The struggle in her mind and\r\nthe experiments of her life have been laid bare to the eyes of her\r\nfellow-creatures with fearless openness--fearless, not shameless. Let\r\nno man confound the bold unreserve of Sand with that of those who have\r\nlost the feeling of beauty and the love of good. With a bleeding heart\r\nand bewildered feet she sought the truth, and if she lost the way,\r\nreturned as soon as convinced she had done so; but she would never\r\nhide the fact that she had lost it. \"What God knows, I dare avow to\r\nman,\" seems to be her motto. It is impossible not to see in her, not\r\nonly the distress and doubts of the intellect, but the temptations of\r\na sensual nature; but we see too the courage of a hero and a deep\r\ncapacity for religion. This mixed nature, too, fits her peculiarly to\r\nspeak to men so diseased as men are at present. They feel she knows\r\ntheir ailment, and if she find a cure, it will really be by a specific\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\nAn upward tendency and growing light are observable in all her works\r\nfor several years past, till now, in the present, she has expressed\r\nsuch conclusions as forty years of the most varied experience have\r\nbrought to one who had shrunk from no kind of discipline, yet still\r\ncried to God amid it all; one who, whatever you may say against her,\r\nyou must feel has never accepted a word for a thing, or worn one\r\nmoment the veil of hypocrisy; and this person one of the most powerful\r\nnature, both as to passion and action, and of an ardent, glowing\r\ngenius. These conclusions are sadly incomplete. There is an amazing\r\nalloy in the last product of her crucible, but there is also so much\r\nof pure gold that the book is truly a cordial, as its name of Consuelo\r\n(consolation) promises.\r\n\r\nThe young Consuelo lives as a child the life of a beggar. Her youth is\r\npassed in the lowest circumstances of the streets of Venice. She\r\nbrings the more pertinacious fire of Spanish blood to be fostered by\r\nthe cheerful airs of Italy. A vague sense of the benefits to be\r\nderived, from such mingling of various influences, in the formation of\r\na character, is to be discerned in several works of art now, when men\r\nare really wishing to become citizens of the world, though old habits\r\nstill interfere on every side with so noble a development.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more charming than the first volume, which describes\r\nthe young girl amid the common life of Venice. It is sunny, open, and\r\nromantic as the place. The beauty of her voice, when a little\r\nsinging-girl in the streets, arrested the attention of a really great\r\nand severe master, Porpora, who educated her to music. In this she\r\nfinds the vent and the echo for her higher self. Her affections are\r\nfixed on a young companion, an unworthy object, but she does not know\r\nhim to be so. She judges from her own candid soul, that all must be\r\ngood, and derives from the tie, for a while, the fostering influences\r\nwhich love alone has for genius. Clear perception follows quickly upon\r\nher first triumphs in art. They have given her a rival, and a mean\r\nrival, in her betrothed, whose talent, though great, is of an inferior\r\ngrade to hers; who is vain, every way impure. Her master, Porpora,\r\ntries to avail himself of this disappointment to convince her that the\r\nartist ought to devote himself to art alone; that private ties must\r\ninterfere with his perfection and his glory. But the nature of\r\nConsuelo revolts against this doctrine, as it would against the\r\nseclusion of a convent. She feels that genius requires manifold\r\nexperience for its development, and that the mind, concentrated on a\r\nsingle object, is likely to pay by a loss of vital energy for the\r\neconomy of thoughts and time.\r\n\r\nDriven by these circumstances into Germany, she is brought into\r\ncontact with the old noblesse, a very different, but far less\r\ncharming, atmosphere than that of the gondoliers of Venice. But here,\r\ntoo, the strong, simple character of our Consuelo is unconstrained, if\r\nnot at home, and when her heart swells and needs expansion, she can\r\nsing.\r\n\r\nHere the Count de Rudolstadt, Albert, loves Consuelo, which seems, in\r\nthe conduct of the relation, a type of a religious democracy in love\r\nwith the spirit of art. We do not mean that any such cold abstraction\r\nis consciously intended, but all that is said means this. It shadows\r\nforth one of the greatest desires which convulse our age.\r\n\r\nA most noble meaning is couched in the history of Albert, and though\r\nthe writer breaks down under such great attempts, and the religion and\r\nphilosophy of the book are clumsily embodied compared with its poesy\r\nand rhetoric, yet great and still growing thoughts are expressed with\r\nsufficient force to make the book a companion of rare value to one in\r\nthe same phase of mind.\r\n\r\nAlbert is the aristocratic democrat, such as Alfieri was; one who, in\r\nhis keen perception of beauty, shares the good of that culture which\r\nages have bestowed on the more fortunate classes, but in his large\r\nheart loves and longs for the good of all men, as if he had himself\r\nsuffered in the lowest pits of human misery. He is all this and more\r\nin his transmigration, real or fancied, of soul, through many forms of\r\nheroic effort and bloody error; in his incompetency to act at the\r\npresent time, his need of long silences, of the company of the dead\r\nand of fools, and eventually of a separation from all habitual ties,\r\nis expressed a great idea, which is still only in the throes of birth,\r\nyet the nature of whose life we begin to prognosticate with some\r\nclearness.\r\n\r\nConsuelo's escape from the castle, and even from Albert, her\r\nadmiration of him, and her incapacity to love him till her own\r\ncharacter be more advanced, are told with great naturalness. Her\r\ntravels with Joseph Haydn, are again as charmingly told as the\r\nVenetian life. Here the author speaks from her habitual existence, and\r\nfar more masterly than of those deep places of thought where she is\r\nless at home. She has lived much, discerned much, felt great need of\r\ngreat thoughts, but not been able to think a great way for herself.\r\nShe fearlessly accompanies the spirit of the age, but she never\r\nsurpasses it; _that_ is the office of the great thinker.\r\n\r\nAt Vienna Consuelo is brought fully into connection with the great\r\nworld as an artist. She finds that its realities, so far from being\r\nless, are even more harsh and sordid for the artist than for any\r\nother; and that with avarice, envy and falsehood, she must prepare for\r\nthe fearful combat which awaits noble souls in any kind of arena, with\r\nthe pain of disgust when they cannot raise themselves to\r\npatience--with the almost equal pain, when they can, of pity for those\r\nwho know not what they do.\r\n\r\nAlbert is on the verge of the grave; and Consuelo, who, not being able\r\nto feel for him sufficient love to find in it compensation for the\r\nloss of that artist-life to which she feels Nature has destined her,\r\nhad hitherto resisted the entreaties of his aged father, and the\r\npleadings of her own reverential and tender sympathy with the wants of\r\nhis soul, becomes his wife just before he dies.\r\n\r\nThe sequel, therefore, of this history is given under the title of\r\nCountess of Rudolstadt. Consuelo is still on the stage; she is at the\r\nPrussian court. The well-known features of this society, as given in\r\nthe memoirs of the time, are put together with much grace and wit. The\r\nsketch of Frederic is excellent.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the book is devoted to expression of the author's ideas on\r\nthe subject of reform, and especially of association as a means\r\nthereto. As her thoughts are yet in a very crude state, the execution\r\nof this part is equally bungling and clumsy. Worse: she falsifies the\r\ncharacters of both Consuelo and Albert,--who is revived again by\r\nsubterfuge of trance,--and stains her best arrangements by the mixture\r\nof falsehood and intrigue.\r\n\r\nYet she proceeds towards, if she walks not by, the light of a great\r\nidea; and sincere democracy, universal religion, scatter from afar\r\nmany seeds upon the page for a future time. The book should be, and\r\nwill be, universally read. Those especially who have witnessed all\r\nSand's doubts and sorrows on the subject of marriage, will rejoice in\r\nthe clearer, purer ray which dawns upon her now. The most natural and\r\ndeep part of the book, though not her main object, is what relates to\r\nthe struggle between the claims of art and life, as to whether it be\r\nbetter for the world and one's self to develop to perfection a talent\r\nwhich Heaven seemed to have assigned as a special gift and vocation,\r\nor sacrifice it whenever the character seems to require this for its\r\ngeneral development. The character of Consuelo is, throughout the\r\nfirst part, strong, delicate, simple, bold, and pure. The fair lines\r\nof this picture are a good deal broken in the second part; but we must\r\nremain true to the impression originally made upon us by this charming\r\nand noble creation of the soul of Sand.\r\n\r\nIt is in reference to _our_ Consuelo that a correspondent\r\n[Footnote: We do not know how accurate is this correspondent's\r\nstatement of facts. The narrative is certainly interesting.--_Ed_.]\r\nwrites, as to Jenny Lind; and we are rejoiced to find that so many\r\nhints were, or might have been, furnished for the picture from real\r\nlife. If Jenny Lind did not suggest it, yet she must also be, in her\r\nown sphere, a Consuelo.\r\n\r\n\"Jenny Lind must have been born about 1822 or 1828. When a young\r\nchild, she was observed, playing about and singing in the streets of\r\nStockholm, by Mr. Berg, master of singing for the royal opera. Pleased\r\nand astonished at the purity and suavity of her voice, he inquired\r\ninstantly for her family, and found her father, a poor innkeeper,\r\nwilling and glad to give up his daughter to his care, on the promise\r\nto protect her and give her an excellent musical education. He was\r\nalways very careful of her, never permitting her to sing except in his\r\npresence, and never letting her appear on the stage, unless as a mute\r\nfigure in some ballet, such, for instance, as Cupid and the Graces,\r\ntill she was sixteen, when she at once executed her part in 'Der\r\nFreyschutz,' to the full satisfaction and surprise of the public of\r\nStockholm. From that time she gradually became the favorite of every\r\none. Without beauty, she seems, from her innocent and gracious\r\nmanners, beautiful on the stage and charming in society. She is one of\r\nthe few actresses whom no evil tongue can ever injure, and is\r\nrespected and welcomed in any and all societies.\r\n\r\n\"The circumstances that reminded me of Consuelo were these: that she\r\nwas a poor child, taken up by this singing-master, and educated\r\nthoroughly and severely by him; that she loved his son, who was a\r\ngood-for-nothing fellow, like Anzoleto, and at last discarded him;\r\nthat she refused the son of an English earl, and, when he fell sick,\r\nhis father condescended to entreat for him, just as the Count of\r\nRudolstadt did for his son; that, though plain and low in stature,\r\nwhen singing her best parts she appears beautiful, and awakens\r\nenthusiastic admiration; that she is rigidly correct in her demeanor\r\ntowards her numerous admirers, having even returned a present sent her\r\nby the crown-prince, Oscar, in a manner that she deemed equivocal.\r\nThis last circumstance being noised abroad, the next time she appeared\r\non the stage she was greeted with more enthusiastic plaudits than\r\never, and thicker showers of flowers fell upon her from the hands of\r\nher true friends, the public. She was more fortunate than Consuelo in\r\nnot being compelled to sing to a public of Prussian corporals.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the picture of Frederic's opera-audience, with the pit full of\r\nhis tall grenadiers with their wives on their shoulders, never daring\r\nto applaud except when he gave the order, as if by tap of drum,\r\nopposed to the tender and expansive nature of the artist, is one of\r\nthe best tragicomedies extant. In Russia, too, all is military; as\r\nsoon as a new musician arrives, he is invested with a rank in the\r\narmy. Even in the church Nicholas has lately done the same. It seems\r\nas if he could not believe a man to be alive, except in the army;\r\ncould not believe the human heart could beat, except by beat of drum.\r\nBut we believe in Russia there is at least a mask of gayety thrown\r\nover the chilling truth. The great Frederic wished no disguise;\r\neverywhere he was chief corporal, and trampled with his everlasting\r\nboots the fair flowers of poesy into the dust.\r\n\r\nThe North has been generous to us of late; she has sent us _Ole\r\nBull_. She is about to send _Frederika Bremer_. May she add\r\nJENNY LIND!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAROLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other evening I heard a gentle voice reading aloud the story of\r\nMaurice, a boy who, deprived of the use of his limbs by paralysis, was\r\nsustained in comfort, and almost in cheerfulness, by the exertions of\r\nhis twin sister. Left with him in orphanage, her affections were\r\ncentred upon him, and, amid the difficulties his misfortunes brought\r\nupon them, grew to a fire intense and pure enough to animate her with\r\nangelic impulses and powers. As he could not move about, she drew him\r\neverywhere in a little cart; and when at last they heard that\r\nsea-bathing might accomplish his cure, conveyed him, in this way,\r\nhundreds of miles to the sea-shore. Her pious devotion and faith were\r\nrewarded by his cure, and (a French story would be entirely incomplete\r\notherwise) with money, plaudits and garlands, from the by-standers.\r\n\r\nThough the story ends in this vulgar manner, it is, in its conduct,\r\nextremely sweet and touching, not only as to the beautiful qualities\r\ndeveloped by these trials in the brother and sister, but in the\r\npurifying and softening influence exerted, by the sight of his\r\nhelplessness and her goodness, on all around them.\r\n\r\nThose who are the victims of some natural blight often fulfil this\r\nimportant office, and bless those within their sphere more, by\r\nawakening feelings of holy tenderness and compassion, than a man\r\nhealthy and strong can do by the utmost exertion of his good-will and\r\nenergies. Thus, in the East, men hold sacred those in whom they find a\r\ndistortion or alienation of mind which makes them unable to provide\r\nfor themselves. The well and sane feel themselves the ministers of\r\nProvidence to carry out a mysterious purpose, while taking care of\r\nthose who are thus left incapable of taking care of themselves; and,\r\nwhile fulfilling this ministry, find themselves refined and made\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe Swiss have similar feelings as to those of their families whom\r\ncretinism has reduced to idiocy. They are attended to, fed, dressed\r\nclean, and provided with a pleasant place for the day, before doing\r\nanything else, even by very busy and poor people.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a similar instance, in this country, of voluntary care of\r\nan idiot, and the mental benefits that ensued. This idiot, like most\r\nthat are called so, was not without a glimmer of mind.\r\n\r\nHis teacher was able to give him some notions, both of spiritual and\r\nmental facts; at least she thought she had given him the idea of God,\r\nand though it appeared by his gestures that to him the moon was the\r\nrepresentative of that idea, yet he certainly did conceive of\r\nsomething above him, and which inspired him with reverence and\r\ndelight. He knew the names of two or three persons who had done him\r\nkindness, and when they were mentioned, would point upward, as he did\r\nto the moon, showing himself susceptible, in his degree, of Mr.\r\nCarlyle's grand method of education, hero-worship. She had awakened in\r\nhim a love of music, so that he could be soothed in his most violent\r\nmoods by her gentle singing. It was a most touching sight to see him\r\nsitting opposite to her at such tunes, his wondering and lack-lustre\r\neyes filled with childish pleasure, while in hers gleamed the same\r\npure joy that we may suppose to animate the looks of an angel\r\nappointed by Heaven to restore a ruined world.\r\n\r\nWe know another instance, in which a young girl became to her village\r\na far more valuable influence than any patron saint who looks down\r\nfrom his stone niche, while his votaries recall the legend of his\r\ngoodness in days long past.\r\n\r\nCaroline lived in a little, quiet country village--quiet as no village\r\ncan now remain, since the railroad strikes its spear through the peace\r\nof country life. She lived alone with a widowed mother, for whom, as\r\nwell as for herself, her needle won bread, while the mother's\r\nstrength, and skill sufficed to the simple duties of their household.\r\nThey lived content and hopeful, till, whether from sitting still too\r\nmuch, or some other cause, Caroline became ill, and soon the physician\r\npronounced her spine to be affected, and to such a degree that she was\r\nincurable.\r\n\r\nThis news was a thunder-bolt to the poor little cottage. The mother,\r\nwho had lost her elasticity of mind, wept in despair; but the young\r\ngirl, who found so early all the hopes and joys of life taken from\r\nher, and that she was seemingly left without any shelter from the\r\nstorm, had even at first the faith and strength to bow her head in\r\ngentleness, and say, \"God will provide.\" She sustained and cheered her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nAnd God did provide. With simultaneous vibration the hearts of all\r\ntheir circle acknowledged the divine obligation of love and mutual aid\r\nbetween human beings. Food, clothing, medicine, service, were all\r\noffered freely to the widow and her daughter.\r\n\r\nCaroline grew worse, and was at last in such a state that she could\r\nonly be moved upon a sheet, and by the aid of two persons. In this\r\ntoilsome service, and every other that she required for years, her\r\nmother never needed to ask assistance. The neighbors took turns in\r\ndoing all that was required, and the young girls, as they were growing\r\nup, counted it among their regular employments to work for or read to\r\nCaroline.\r\n\r\nNot without immediate reward was their service of love. The mind of\r\nthe girl, originally bright and pure, was quickened and wrought up to\r\nthe finest susceptibility by the nervous exaltation that often ensues\r\nupon affection of the spine. The soul, which had taken an upward\r\nimpulse from its first act of resignation, grew daily more and more\r\ninto communion with the higher regions of life, permanent and pure.\r\nPerhaps she was instructed by spirits which, having passed through a\r\nsimilar trial of pain and loneliness, had risen to see the reason why.\r\nHowever that may be, she grew in nobleness of view and purity of\r\nsentiment, and, as she received more instruction from books also than\r\nany other person in her circle, had from many visitors abundant\r\ninformation as to the events which were passing around her, and\r\nleisure to reflect on them with a disinterested desire for truth, she\r\nbecame so much wiser than her companions as to be at last their\r\npreceptress and best friend, and her brief, gentle comments and\r\ncounsels were listened to as oracles from one enfranchised from the\r\nfilms which selfishness and passion cast over the eyes of the\r\nmultitude.\r\n\r\nThe twofold blessing conferred by her presence, both in awakening none\r\nbut good feelings in the hearts of others, and in the instruction she\r\nbecame able to confer, was such, that, at the end of five years, no\r\nmember of that society would have been so generally lamented as\r\nCaroline, had Death called her away.\r\n\r\nBut the messenger, who so often seems capricious in his summons, took\r\nfirst the aged mother, and the poor girl found that life had yet the\r\npower to bring her grief, unexpected and severe.\r\n\r\nAnd now the neighbors met in council. Caroline could not be left quite\r\nalone in the house. Should they take turns, and stay with her by night\r\nas well as by day?\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" said the blacksmith's wife; \"the house will never seem like\r\nhome to her now, poor thing! and 't would be kind of dreary for her to\r\nchange about her _nusses_ so. I'll tell you what; all my children\r\nbut one are married and gone off; we have property enough; I will have\r\na good room fixed for her, and she shall live with us. My husband\r\nwants her to, as much as me.\"\r\n\r\nThe council acquiesced in this truly humane arrangement, and Caroline\r\nlives there still; and we are assured that none of her friends dread\r\nher departure so much as the blacksmith's wife.\r\n\r\n\"'Ta'n't no trouble at all to have her,\" she says, \"and if it was, I\r\nshouldn't care; she is so good and still, and talks so pretty!  It's\r\nas good bein' with her as goin' to meetin'!\"\r\n\r\nDe Maistre relates some similar passages as to a sick girl in St.\r\nPetersburgh, though his mind dwelt more on the spiritual beauty\r\nevinced in her remarks, than on the good she had done to those around\r\nher. Indeed, none bless more than those who \"only stand and wait.\"\r\nEven if their passivity be enforced by fate, it will become a\r\nspiritual activity, if accepted in a faith higher above fate than the\r\nGreek gods were supposed to sit enthroned above misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVER-GROWING LIVES.\r\n\r\n  \"Age could not wither her, nor custom stale\r\n     Her infinite variety.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSo was one person described by the pen which has made a clearer mark\r\nthan any other on the history of Man. But is it not surprising that\r\nsuch a description should apply to so few?\r\n\r\nOf two or three women we read histories that correspond with the hint\r\ngiven in these lines. They were women in whom there was intellect\r\nenough to temper and enrich, heart enough to soften and enliven the\r\nentire being. There was soul enough to keep the body beautiful through\r\nthe term of earthly existence; for while the roundness, the pure,\r\ndelicate lineaments, the flowery bloom of youth were passing, the\r\nmarks left in the course of those years were not merely of time and\r\ncare, but also of exquisite emotions and noble thoughts. With such\r\nchisels Time works upon his statues, tracery and fretwork, well worth\r\nthe loss of the first virgin beauty of the alabaster; while the fire\r\nwithin, growing constantly brighter and brighter, shows all these\r\nchanges in the material, as rich and varied ornaments. The vase, at\r\nlast, becomes a lamp of beauty, fit to animate the councils of the\r\ngreat, or the solitude of the altar.\r\n\r\nTwo or three women there have been, who have thus grown even more\r\nbeautiful with age. We know of many more men of whom this is true.\r\nThese have been heroes, or still more frequently poets and artists;\r\nwith whom the habitual life tended to expand the soul, deepen and vary\r\nthe experience, refine the perceptions, and immortalize the hopes and\r\ndreams of youth.\r\n\r\nThey were persons who never lost their originality of character, nor\r\nspontaneity of action. Their impulses proceeded from a fulness and\r\ncertainty of character, that made it impossible they should doubt or\r\nrepent, whatever the results of their actions might be.\r\n\r\nThey could not repent, in matters little or great, because they felt\r\nthat their notions were a sincere exposition of the wants of their\r\nsouls. Their impulsiveness was not the restless fever of one who must\r\nchange his place somehow or some-whither, but the waves of a tide,\r\nwhich might be swelled to vehemence by the action of the winds or the\r\ninfluence of an attractive orb, but was none the less subject to fixed\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nA character which does not lose its freedom of motion and impulse by\r\ncontact with the world, grows with its years more richly creative,\r\nmore freshly individual. It is a character governed by a principle of\r\nits own, and not by rules taken from other men's experience; and\r\ntherefore it is that\r\n\r\n  \"Age cannot wither them, nor custom stale\r\n     Their infinite variety.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLike violins, they gain by age, and the spirit of him who discourseth\r\nthrough them most excellent music,\r\n\r\n  \"Like wine well kept and long,\r\n   Heady, nor harsh, nor strong,\r\n   With each succeeding year is quaffed\r\n   A richer, purer, mellower draught.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOur French neighbors have been the object of humorous satire for their\r\nnew coinage of terms to describe the heroes of their modern romance.\r\nA hero is no hero unless he has \"ravaged brows,\" is \"blase\" or \"brise\"\r\nor \"fatigue.\" His eyes must be languid, and his cheeks hollow. Youth,\r\nhealth and strength, charm no more; only the tree broken by the gust\r\nof passion is beautiful, only the lamp that has burnt out the better\r\npart of its oil precious, in their eyes. This, with them, assumes the\r\nair of caricature and grimace, yet it indicates a real want of this\r\ntime--a feeling that the human being ought to grow more rather than\r\nless attractive with the passage of time, and that the decrease in\r\nphysical charms would, in a fair and full life, be more than\r\ncompensated by an increase of those which appeal to the imagination\r\nand higher feelings.\r\n\r\nA friend complains that, while most men are like music-boxes, which\r\nyou can wind up to play their set of tunes, and then they stop, in our\r\nsociety the set consists of only two or three tunes at most That is\r\nbecause no new melodies are added after five-and-twenty at farthest.\r\nIt is the topic of jest and amazement with foreigners that what is\r\ncalled society is 'given up so much into the hands of boys and girls.\r\nAccordingly it wants spirit, variety and depth of tone, and we find\r\nthere no historical presences, none of the charms, infinite in\r\nvariety, of Cleopatra, no heads of Julius Caesar, overflowing with\r\nmeanings, as the sun with light.\r\n\r\nSometimes we hear an educated voice that shows us how these things\r\nmight be altered. It has lost the fresh tone of youth, but it has\r\ngained unspeakably in depth, brilliancy, and power of expression. How\r\nexquisite its modulations, so finely shaded, showing that all the\r\nintervals are filled up with little keys of fairy delicacy and in\r\nperfect tune!\r\n\r\nIts deeper tones sound the depth of the past; its more thrilling notes\r\nexpress an awakening to the infinite, and ask a thousand questions of\r\nthe spirits that are to unfold our destinies, too far-reaching to be\r\nclothed in words. Who does not feel the sway of such a voice? It makes\r\nthe whole range of our capacities resound and tremble, and, when there\r\nis positiveness enough to give an answer, calls forth most melodious\r\nechoes.\r\n\r\nThe human eye gains, in like manner, by tune and experience. Its\r\nsubstance fades, but it is only the more filled with an ethereal\r\nlustre which penetrates the gazer till he feels as if\r\n\r\n  \"That eye were in itself a soul,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand realizes the range of its power\r\n\r\n  \"To rouse, to win, to fascinate, to melt,\r\n   And by its spell of undefined control\r\n   Magnetic draw the secrets of the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eye that shone beneath the white locks of Thorwaldsen was such an\r\none,--the eye of immortal youth, the indicator of the man's whole\r\naspect in a future sphere. We have scanned such eyes closely; when\r\nnear, we saw that the lids were red, the corners defaced with ominous\r\nmarks, the orb looked faded and tear-stained; but when we retreated\r\nfar enough for its ray to reach us, it seemed far younger than the\r\nclear and limpid gaze of infancy, more radiant than the sweetest beam\r\nin that of early youth. The Future and the Past met in that glance,\r\n\r\nO for more such eyes! The vouchers of free, of full and ever-growing\r\nlives!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD NOBLENESS,\r\n\r\n  \"Mistress of herself, though China fell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen, in general, are indignant that the satirist should have made\r\nthis the climax to his praise of a woman. And yet, we fear, he saw\r\nonly too truly. What unexpected failures have we seen, literally, in\r\nthis respect! How often did the Martha blur the Mary out of the face\r\nof a lovely woman at the sound of a crash amid glass and porcelain!\r\nWhat sad littleness in all the department thus represented! Obtrusion\r\nof the mop and duster on the tranquil meditation of a husband and\r\nbrother. Impatience if the carpet be defaced by the feet even of\r\ncherished friends.\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful side, and a good reason here; but why must the\r\nbeauty degenerate, and give place to meanness?\r\n\r\nTo Woman the care of home is confided. It is the sanctuary, of which\r\nshe should be the guardian angel. To all elements that are introduced\r\nthere she should be the \"ordering mind.\" She represents the spirit of\r\nbeauty, and her influence should be spring-like, clothing all objects\r\nwithin her sphere with lively, fresh and tender hues.\r\n\r\nShe represents purity, and all that appertains to her should be kept\r\ndelicately pure. She is modesty, and draperies should soften all rude\r\nlineaments, and exclude glare and dust. She is harmony, and all\r\nobjects should be in their places ready for, and matched to, their\r\nuses.\r\n\r\nWe all know that there is substantial reason for the offence we feel\r\nat defect in any of these ways. A woman who wants purity, modesty and\r\nharmony, in her dress and manners, is insufferable; one who wants them\r\nin the arrangements of her house, disagreeable to everybody. She\r\nneglects the most obvious ways of expressing what we desire to see in\r\nher, and the inference is ready, that the inward sense is wanting.\r\n\r\nIt is with no merely gross and selfish feeling that all men commend\r\nthe good housekeeper, the good nurse. Neither is it slight praise to\r\nsay of a woman that she does well the honors of her house in the way\r\nof hospitality. The wisdom that can maintain serenity, cheerfulness\r\nand order, in a little world of ten or twelve persons, and keep ready\r\nthe resources that are needed for their sustenance and recovery in\r\nsickness and sorrow, is the same that holds the stars in their places,\r\nand patiently prepares the precious metals in the most secret chambers\r\nof the earth. The art of exercising a refined hospitality is a fine\r\nart, and the music thus produced only differs from that of the\r\norchestra in this, that in the former case the overture or sonata\r\ncannot be played twice in the same manner. It requires that the\r\nhostess shall combine true self-respect and repose,\r\n\r\n  \"The simple art of _not too much_,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwith refined perception of individual traits and moods in character,\r\nwith variety and vivacity, an ease, grace and gentleness, that diffuse\r\ntheir sweetness insensibly through every nook of an assembly, and call\r\nout reciprocal sweetness wherever there is any to be found.\r\n\r\nThe only danger in all this is the same that besets us in every walk\r\nof life; to wit, that of preferring the outward sign to the inward\r\nspirit whenever there is cause to hesitate between the two.\r\n\r\n\"I admire,\" says Goethe, \"the Chinese novels; they express so happily\r\nease, peace and a finish unknown to other nations in the interior\r\narrangements of their homes.\r\n\r\n\"In one of them I came upon the line, 'I heard the lovely maidens\r\nlaughing, and found my way to the garden, where they were seated in\r\ntheir light cane-chairs,' To me this brings an immediate animation, by\r\nthe images it suggests of lightness, brightness and elegance.\"\r\n\r\nThis is most true, but it is also most true that the garden-house\r\nwould not seem thus charming unless its light cane-chairs had lovely,\r\nlaughing maidens seated in them. And the lady who values her\r\nporcelain, that most exquisite product of the peace and\r\nthorough-breeding of China, so highly, should take the hint, and\r\nremember that unless the fragrant herb of wit, sweetened by kindness,\r\nand softened by the cream of affability, also crown her board, the\r\nprettiest tea-cups in the world might as well lie in fragments in the\r\ngutter, as adorn her social show. The show loses its beauty when it\r\nceases to represent a substance.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, it is only vanity, narrowness and self-seeking,\r\nthat spoil a good thing. Women would never be too good housekeepers\r\nfor their own peace and that of others, if they considered\r\nhousekeeping only as a means to an end. If their object were really\r\nthe peace and joy of all concerned, they could bear to have their cups\r\nand saucers broken more easily than their tempers, and to have\r\ncurtains and carpets soiled, rather than their hearts by mean and\r\nsmall feelings. But they are brought up to think it is a disgrace to\r\nbe a bad housekeeper, not because they must, by such a defect, be a\r\ncause of suffering and loss of time to all within their sphere, but\r\nbecause all other women will laugh at them if they are so. Here is the\r\nvice,--for want of a high motive there can be no truly good action.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a woman, otherwise noble and magnanimous in a high\r\ndegree, so insane on this point as to weep bitterly because she found\r\na little dust on her picture-frames, and torment her guests all\r\ndinner-time with excuses for the way in which the dinner was cooked.\r\n\r\nWe have known others to join with their servants to backbite the best\r\nand noblest friends for trifling derelictions against the accustomed\r\norder of the house. The broom swept out the memory of much sweet\r\ncounsel and loving-kindness, and spots on the table-cloth were more\r\nregarded than those they made on their own loyalty and honor in the\r\nmost intimate relations.\r\n\r\n\"The worst of furies is a woman scorned,\" and the sex, so lively,\r\nmobile, impassioned, when passion is aroused at all, are in danger of\r\nfrightful error, under great temptation. The angel can give place to a\r\nmore subtle and treacherous demon, though one, generally, of less\r\ntantalizing influence, than in the breast of man. In great crises,\r\nWoman needs the highest reason to restrain her; but her besetting sin\r\nis that of littleness. Just because nature and society unite to call\r\non her for such fineness and finish, she can be so petty, so fretful,\r\nso vain, envious and base! O, women, see your danger! See how much you\r\nneed a great object in all your little actions. You cannot be fair,\r\nnor can your homes be fair, unless you are holy and noble. Will you\r\nsweep and garnish the house, only that it may be ready for a legion of\r\nevil spirits to enter in--for imps and demons of gossip, frivolity,\r\ndetraction, and a restless fever about small ills? What is the house\r\nfor, if good spirits cannot peacefully abide there? Lo! they are\r\nasking for the bill in more than one well-garnished mansion. They\r\nsought a home and found a work-house. Martha! it was thy fault!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"GLUMDALCLITCHES.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis title was wittily given by an editor of this city to the ideal\r\nwoman demanded in \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century.\" We do not object\r\nto it, thinking it is really desirable that women should grow beyond\r\nthe average size which has been prescribed for them. We find in the\r\nlast news from Paris these anecdotes of two who \"tower\" an inch or\r\nmore \"above their sex,\" if not yet of Glumdalclitch stature.\r\n\r\n\"_Bravissima!_--The 7th of May, at Paris, a young girl, who was\r\nwashing linen, fell into the Canal St. Martin. Those around called out\r\nfor help, but none ventured to give it. Just then a young lady\r\nelegantly dressed came up and saw the case; in the twinkling of an eye\r\nshe threw off her hat and shawl, threw herself in, and succeeded in\r\ndragging the young girl to the brink, after having sought for her in\r\nvain several times under the water. This lady was Mlle. Adele\r\nChevalier, an actress. She was carried, with the girl she had saved,\r\ninto a neighboring house, which she left, after having received the\r\nnecessary cares, in a fiacre, and amid the plaudits of the crowd.\"\r\n\r\nThe second anecdote is of a different kind, but displays a kind of\r\nmagnanimity still more unusual in this poor servile world:\r\n\r\n\"One of our (French) most distinguished painters of sea-subjects,\r\nGudin, has married a rich young English lady, belonging to a family of\r\nhigh rank, and related to the Duke of Wellington. M. Gudin was lately\r\nat Berlin at the same time with K----, inspector of pictures to the\r\nKing of Holland. The King of Prussia desired that both artists should\r\nbe presented to him, and received Gudin in a very flattering manner;\r\nhis genius being his only letter of recommendation.\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur K---- has not the same advantage; but, to make up for it, he\r\nhas a wife who enjoys in Holland a great reputation for her beauty.\r\nThe King of Prussia is a cavalier, who cares more for pretty ladies\r\nthan for genius. So Monsieur and Madame K---- were invited to the\r\nroyal table--an honor which was not accorded to Monsieur and Madame\r\nGudin.\r\n\r\n\"Humble representations were made to the monarch, advising him not to\r\nmake such a marked distinction between the French artist and the Dutch\r\namateur. These failing, the wise counsellors went to Madame Gudin,\r\nand, intimating that they did so with the good-will of the king, said\r\nthat she might be received as cousin to the Duke of Wellington, as\r\ndaughter of an English general, and of a family which dates back to\r\nthe thirteenth century. She could, if she wished, avail herself of her\r\nrights of birth to obtain the same honors with Madame K----. To sit at\r\nthe table of the king, she need only cease for a moment to be Madame\r\nGudin, and become once more Lady L----.\"\r\n\r\nDoes not all this sound like a history of the seventeenth century?\r\nSurely etiquette was never maintained in a more arrogant manner at the\r\ncourt of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nBut Madame Gudin replied that her highest pride lay in the celebrated\r\nname which she bears at present; that she did not wish to rely on any\r\nother to obtain so futile a distinction, and that, in her eyes, the\r\nmost noble escutcheon was the palette of her husband.\r\n\r\nI need not say that this dignified feeling was not comprehended.\r\nMadame Gudin was not received at the table, but she had shown the\r\nnobleness of her character. For the rest, Madame K----, on arriving at\r\nParis, had the bad taste to boast of having been distinguished above\r\nMadame Gudin, and the story reaching the Tuileries, where Monsieur and\r\nMadame Gudin are highly favored, excited no little mirth in the circle\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"ELLEN: OR, FORGIVE AND FORGET.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe notice this coarsely-written little fiction because it is one of a\r\nclass which we see growing with pleasure. We see it with pleasure,\r\nbecause, in its way, it is genuine. It is a transcript of the crimes,\r\ncalumnies, excitements, half-blind love of right, and honest\r\nindignation at the sort of wrong which it can discern, to be found in\r\nthe class from which it emanates.\r\n\r\nThat class is a large one in our country villages, and these books\r\nreflect its thoughts and manners as half-penny ballads do the life of\r\nthe streets of London. The ballads are not more true to the facts; but\r\nthey give us, in a coarser form, far more of the spirit than we get\r\nfrom the same facts reflected in the intellect of a Dickens, for\r\ninstance, or of any writer far enough above the scene to be properly\r\nits artist.\r\n\r\nSo, in this book, we find what Cooper, Miss Sedgwick and Mrs.\r\nKirkland, might see, as the writer did, but could hardly believe in\r\nenough to speak of it with such fidelity.\r\n\r\nIt is a current superstition that country people are more pure and\r\nhealthy in mind and body than those who live in cities. It may be so\r\nin countries of old-established habits, where a genuine peasantry have\r\ninherited some of the practical wisdom and loyalty of the past, with\r\nmost of its errors. We have our doubts, though, from the stamp upon\r\nliterature, always the nearest evidence of truth we can get, whether,\r\neven there, the difference between town and country life is as much in\r\nfavor of the latter as is generally supposed. But in our land, where\r\nthe country is at present filled with a mixed population, who come\r\nseeking to be purified by a better life and culture from all the ills\r\nand diseases of the worst forms of civilization, things often\r\n_look_ worse than in the city; perhaps because men have more time\r\nand room to let their faults grow and offend the light of day.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions, and not a few; but, in a very great proportion\r\nof country villages, the habits of the people, as to food, air, and\r\neven exercise, are ignorant and unhealthy to the last degree. Their\r\nwant of all pure faith, and appetite for coarse excitement, is shown\r\nby continued intrigues, calumnies, and crimes.\r\n\r\nWe have lived in a beautiful village, where, more favorably placed\r\nthan any other person in it, both as to withdrawal from bad\r\nassociations and nearness to good, we heard inevitably, from\r\ndomestics, work-people, and school-children, more ill of human nature\r\nthan we could possibly sift were we to elect such a task from all the\r\nnewspapers of this city, in the same space of time.\r\n\r\nWe believe the amount of ill circulated by means of anonymous letters,\r\nas described in this book, to be as great as can be imported in all\r\nthe French novels (and that is a bold word). We know ourselves of two\r\nor three cases of morbid wickedness, displayed by means of anonymous\r\nletters, that may vie with what puzzled the best wits of France in a\r\nfamous law-suit not long since. It is true, there is, to balance all\r\nthis, a healthy rebound,--a surprise and a shame; and there are\r\nheartily good people, such as are described in this book, who, having\r\ntaken a direction upward, keep it, and cannot be bent downward nor\r\naside. But, then, the reverse of the picture is of a blackness that\r\nwould appall one who came to it with any idyllic ideas of the purity\r\nand peaceful loveliness of agricultural life.\r\n\r\nBut what does this prove? Only the need of a dissemination of all that\r\nis best, intellectually and morally, through the whole people. Our\r\ngroves and fields have no good fairies or genii who teach, by legend\r\nor gentle apparition, the truths, the principles, that can alone\r\npreserve the village, as the city, from the possession of the fiend.\r\nTheir place must be taken by the school-master, and he must be one who\r\nknows not only \"readin', writin', and 'rithmetic,\" but the service of\r\nGod and the destiny of man. Our people require a thoroughly-diffused\r\nintellectual life, a religious aim, such as no people at large ever\r\npossessed before; else they must sink till they become dregs, rather\r\nthan rise to become the cream of creation, which they are too apt to\r\nflatter themselves with the fancy of being already.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting fiction we have ever read in this coarse, homely,\r\nbut genuine class, is one called \"Metallek.\" It may be in circulation\r\nin this city; but we bought it in a country nook, and from a pedlar;\r\nand it seemed to belong to the country. Had we met with it in any\r\nother way, it would probably have been to throw it aside again\r\ndirectly, for the author does not know how to write English, and the\r\nfirst chapters give no idea of his power of apprehending the poetry of\r\nlife. But happening to read on, we became fixed and charmed, and have\r\nretained from its perusal the sweetest picture of life lived in this\r\nland, ever afforded us, out of the pale of personal observation. That\r\nsuch things are, private observation has made us sure; but the writers\r\nof books rarely seem to have seen them; rarely to have walked alone in\r\nan untrodden path long enough to hold commune with the spirit of the\r\nscene.\r\n\r\nIn this book you find the very life; the most vulgar prose, and the\r\nmost exquisite poetry. You follow the hunter in his path, walking\r\nthrough the noblest and fairest scenes only to shoot the poor animals\r\nthat were happy there, winning from the pure atmosphere little benefit\r\nexcept to good appetite, sleeping at night in the dirty hovels, with\r\npeople who burrow in them to lead a life but little above that of the\r\nsquirrels end foxes. There is throughout that air of room enough, and\r\nfree if low forms of human nature, which, at such times, makes\r\nbearable all that would otherwise be so repulsive.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to the girl who is the presiding deity, or rather the\r\ntutelary angel of the scene, how are all discords harmonized; how all\r\nits latent music poured forth! It is a portrait from the life--it has\r\nthe mystic charm of fulfilled reality, how far beyond the fairest\r\nideals ever born of thought! Pure, and brilliantly blooming as the\r\nflower of the wilderness, she, in like manner, shares while she\r\nsublimes its nature. She plays round the most vulgar and rude beings,\r\ngentle and caressing, yet unsullied; in her wildness there is nothing\r\ncold or savage; her elevation is soft and warm. Never have we seen\r\nnatural religion more beautifully expressed; never so well discerned\r\nthe influence of the natural nun, who needs no veil or cloister to\r\nguard from profanation the beauty she has dedicated to God, and which\r\nonly attracts human love to hallow it into the divine.\r\n\r\nThe lonely life of the girl after the death of her parents,--her\r\nfearlessness, her gay and sweet enjoyment of nature, her intercourse\r\nwith the old people of the neighborhood, her sisterly conduct towards\r\nher \"suitors,\"--all seem painted from the life; but the death-bed\r\nscene seems borrowed from some sermon, and is not in harmony with the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nIn this connection we must try to make amends for the stupidity of an\r\nearlier notice of the novel, called \"Margaret, or the Real and Ideal,\"\r\n&c. At the time of that notice we had only looked into it here and\r\nthere, and did no justice to a work full of genius, profound in its\r\nmeaning, and of admirable fidelity to nature in its details. Since\r\nthen we have really read it, and appreciated the sight and\r\nrepresentation of soul-realities; and we have lamented the long delay\r\nof so true a pleasure.\r\n\r\nA fine critic said, \"This is a Yankee novel; or rather let it be\r\ncalled _the_ Yankee novel, as nowhere else are the thought and\r\ndialect of our villages really represented.\" Another discovered that\r\nit must have been written in Maine, by the perfection with which\r\npeculiar features of scenery there are described.\r\n\r\nA young girl could not sufficiently express her delight at the simple\r\nnature with which scenes of childhood are given, and especially at\r\nMargaret's first going to meeting. She had never elsewhere found\r\nwritten down what she had felt.\r\n\r\nA mature reader, one of the most spiritualized and harmonious minds we\r\nhave ever met, admires the depth and fulness in which the workings of\r\nthe spirit through the maiden's life are seen by the author, and shown\r\nto us; but laments the great apparatus with which the consummation of\r\nthe whole is brought about, and the formation of a new church and\r\nstate, before the time is yet ripe, under the banner of Mons. Christi.\r\n\r\nBut all these voices, among those most worthy to be heard, find in the\r\nbook a _real presence_, and draw from it auspicious omens that an\r\nAmerican literature is possible even in our day, because there are\r\nalready in the mind here existent developments worthy to see the\r\nlight, gold-fishes amid the moss in the still waters.\r\n\r\nFor ourselves, we have been most charmed with the way the Real and\r\nIdeal are made to weave and shoot rays through one another, in which\r\nMargaret bestows on external nature what she receives through books,\r\nand wins back like gifts in turn, till the pond and the mythology are\r\nalternate sections of the same chapter. We delight in the teachings\r\nshe receives through Chilion and his violin, till on the grave of \"one\r\nwho tried to love his fellow-men\" grows up the full white rose-flower\r\nof her life. The ease with which she assimilates the city life when in\r\nit, making it a part of her imaginative tapestry, is a sign of the\r\npower to which she has grown.\r\n\r\nWe have much more to think and to say of the book, as a whole, and in\r\nparts; and should the mood and summer leisure ever permit a familiar\r\nand intimate acquaintance with it, we trust they will be both thought\r\nand said. For the present, we will only add that it exhibits the same\r\nstate of things, and strives to point out such remedies as we have\r\nhinted at in speaking of the little book which heads this notice;\r\nitself a rude charcoal sketch, but if read as hieroglyphics are,\r\npointing to important meanings and results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COURRIER DES ETATS UNIS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other nation can hope to vie with the French in the talent of\r\ncommunicating information with ease, vivacity and consciousness. They\r\nmust always be the best narrators and the best interpreters, so far as\r\npresenting a clear statement of outlines goes. Thus they are excellent\r\nin conversation, lectures, and journalizing.\r\n\r\nAfter we know all the news of the day, it is still pleasant to read\r\nthe bulletin of the _\"Courrier des Etats Unis.\"_ We rarely agree\r\nwith the view taken; but as a summary it is so excellently well done,\r\nevery topic put in its best place, with such a light and vigorous\r\nhand, that we have the same pleasure we have felt in fairy tales, when\r\nsome person under trial is helped by a kind fairy to sort the silks\r\nand feathers to their different places, till the glittering confusion\r\nassumes the order,--of a kaleidoscope.\r\n\r\nThen, what excellent correspondents they have in Paris! What a\r\nhumorous and yet clear account we have before us, now, of the Thiers\r\ngame! We have traced Guizot through every day with the utmost\r\ndistinctness, and see him perfectly in the sick-room. Now, here is\r\nThiers, playing with his chess-men, Jesuits, &c. A hundred clumsy\r\nEnglish or American papers could not make the present crisis in Paris\r\nso clear as we see it in the glass of these nimble Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is with newspaper-writing as with food; the English and\r\nAmericans have as good appetites, but do not, and never will, know so\r\nwell how to cook as the French. The Parisian correspondent of the\r\n_\"Schnellpost\"_ also makes himself merry with the play of M.\r\nThiers. Both speak with some feeling of the impressive utterance of\r\nLamartine in the late debates. The Jesuits stand their ground, but\r\nthere is a wave advancing which will not fail to wash away what ought\r\nto go,--nor are its roarings, however much in advance of the wave\r\nitself, to be misinterpreted by intelligent ears. The world is raising\r\nits sleepy lids, and soon no organization can exist which from its\r\nvery nature interferes in any way with the good of the whole.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the terrors of the authorities are more and more directed\r\nagainst the communists. They are very anxious to know what communism\r\nreally is, or means. They have almost forgotten, says the\r\ncorrespondent, the repression of the Jews, and like objects, in this\r\nnew terror. Meanwhile, the Russian Emperor has issued an edict,\r\ncommanding the Polish Jews, both men and women, to lay aside their\r\nnational garb. He hopes thus to mingle them with the rest of the mass\r\nhe moves. It will be seen whether such work can be done by beginning\r\nupon the outward man.\r\n\r\nThe Paris correspondent of the _\"Courrier,\"_ who gives an account\r\nof amusements, has always many sprightly passages illustrative of the\r\ntemper of the times. Horse-races are now the fashion, in which he\r\nrejoices, as being likely to give to France good horses of her own. A\r\nfamous lottery is on the point of coming off,--to give an organ to the\r\nChurch of St. Eustache,--on which it does not require a very high tone\r\nof morals to be severe. A public exhibition has been made of the\r\nsplendid array of prizes, including every article of luxury, from\r\njewels and cashmere shawls down to artificial flowers.\r\n\r\nA nobleman, president of the Horticultural Society, had given an\r\nentertainment, in which the part of the different flowers was acted by\r\nbeautiful women, that of fruit and vegetables by distinguished men.\r\nSuch an amusement would admit of much light grace and wit, which may\r\nstill be found in France, if anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nThere is also an amusing story of the stir caused among the French\r\npolitical leaders by the visit of a nobleman of one of the great\r\nEnglish families, to Paris. \"He had had several audiences, previous to\r\nhis departure from London, of Queen Victoria; he received a despatch\r\ndaily from the English court. But in reply to all overtures made to\r\ninduce him to open his mission, he preserved a gloomy silence. All\r\nattentions, all signs of willing confidence, are lavished on him in\r\nvain. France is troubled. 'Has England,' thought she, 'a secret from\r\nus, while we have none from her?' She was on the point of inventing\r\none, when, lo! the secret mission turns out to be the preparation of a\r\nball-dress, with whose elegance, fresh from Parisian genius, her\r\nBritannic majesty wished to dazzle and surprise her native realm.\"\r\n\r\n'T is a pity Americans cannot learn the grace which decks these\r\ntrifling jests with so much prettiness. Till we can import something\r\nof that, we have no right to rejoice in French fashions and French\r\nwines. Such a nervous, driving nation as we are, ought to learn to fly\r\nalong gracefully, on the light, fantastic toe. Can we not learn\r\nsomething of the English beside the knife and fork conventionalities\r\nwhich, with them, express a certain solidity of fortune and resolve?\r\nCan we not get from the French something beside their worst novels?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COURRIER DES ETATS UNIS.\"\r\n\r\nOUR PROTEGEE, QUEEN VICTORIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Courrier_ laughs, though with features somewhat too\r\ndisturbed for a graceful laugh, at a notice, published a few days\r\nsince in the _Tribune_, of one of its jests which scandalized the\r\nAmerican editor. It does not content itself with a slight notice, but\r\nputs forth a manifesto, in formidably large type, in reply.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the jest itself, we must remark that Mr. Greeley saw\r\nthis only in a translation, where it had lost whatever of light and\r\ngraceful in its manner excused a piece of raillery very coarse in its\r\nsubstance. We will admit that, had he seen it as it originally stood,\r\nconnected with other items in the playful chronicle of Pierre Durand,\r\nit would have impressed him differently.\r\n\r\nBut the cause of irritation in the _Courrier_, and of the sharp\r\nrepartees of its manifesto, is, probably, what was said of the\r\ninfluence among us of \"French literature and French morals,\" to which\r\nthe \"organ of the French-American population\" felt called on to make a\r\nspirited reply, and has done so with less of wit and courtesy than\r\ncould have been expected from the organ of a people who, whatever may\r\nbe their faults, are at least acknowledged in wit and courtesy\r\npreeminent. We hope that the French who come to us will not become, in\r\nthese respects, Americanized, and substitute the easy sneer, and use\r\nof such terms as \"ridiculous,\" \"virtuous misanthropy,\" &c., for the\r\ngraceful and poignant raillery of their native land, which tickles\r\neven where it wounds.\r\n\r\nWe may say, in reply to the _Courrier_, that if Fourierism\r\n\"recoils towards a state of nature,\" it arises largely from the fact\r\nthat its author lived in a country where the natural relations are, if\r\nnot more cruelly, at least more lightly violated, than in any other of\r\nthe civilized world. The marriage of convention has done its natural\r\noffice in sapping the morals of France, till breach of the marriage\r\nvow has become one of the chief topics of its daily wit, one of the\r\nacknowledged traits of its manners, and a favorite--in these modern\r\ntimes we might say the favorite--subject of its works of fiction. From\r\nthe time of Moliere, himself an agonized sufferer behind his comic\r\nmask from the infidelities of a wife he was not able to cease to love,\r\nthrough memoirs, novels, dramas, and the volleyed squibs of the press,\r\none fact stares us in the face as one of so common occurrence, that\r\nmen, if they have not ceased to suffer in heart and morals from its\r\npoisonous action, have yet learned to bear with a shrug and a careless\r\nlaugh that marks its frequency. Understand, we do not say that the\r\nFrench are the most deeply stained with vice of all nations. We do not\r\nthink them so. There are others where there is as much, but there is\r\nnone where it is so openly acknowledged in literature, and therefore\r\nthere is none whose literature alone is so likely to deprave\r\ninexperienced minds, by familiarizing them with wickedness before they\r\nhave known the lure and the shock of passion. And we believe that this\r\nis the very worst way for youth to be misled, since the miasma thus\r\npervades the whole man, and he is corrupted in head and heart at once,\r\nwithout one strengthening effort at resistance.\r\n\r\nWere it necessary, we might substantiate what we say by quoting from\r\nthe _Courrier_ within the last fortnight, jokes and stories such\r\nas are not to be found so _frequently_ in the prints of any\r\nother nation. There is the story of the girl Adelaide, which, at\r\nanother time, we mean to quote, for its terrible pathos. There is a\r\nman on trial for the murder of his wife, of whom the witnesses say,\r\n\"he was so fond of her you would never have known she was his wife!\"\r\nHere is one, only yesterday, where a man kills a woman to whom he was\r\nmarried by his relatives at eighteen, she being much older, and\r\ndisagreeable to him, but their properties matching. After twelve\r\nyears' marriage, he can no longer support the yoke, and kills both her\r\nand her father, and \"his only regret is that he cannot kill all who\r\nhad anything to do with the match.\"\r\n\r\nEither infidelity or such crimes are the natural result of marriages\r\nmade as they are in France, by agreement between the friends, without\r\nchoice of the parties. It is this horrible system, and not a native\r\nincapacity for pure and permanent relations, that leads to such\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWe must observe, _en passant_, that this man was the father of\r\nfive children by this hated woman--a wickedness not peculiar to France\r\nor any nation, and which cannot foil to do its work of filling the\r\nworld with sickly, weak, or depraved beings, who have reason to curse\r\ntheir brutal father that he does not murder them as well as their\r\nwretched mother,--who, more unhappy than the victim of seduction, is\r\nmade the slave of sense in the name of religion and law.\r\n\r\nThe last steamer brings us news of the disgrace of Victor Hugo, one of\r\nthe most celebrated of the literary men of France, and but lately\r\ncreated one of her peers. The affair, however, is to be publicly\r\n\"hushed up.\"\r\n\r\nBut we need not cite many instances to prove, what is known to the\r\nwhole world, that these wrongs are, if not more frequent, at least\r\nmore lightly treated by the French, in literature and discourse, than\r\nby any nation of Europe. This being the case, can an American, anxious\r\nthat his country should receive, as her only safeguard from endless\r\ntemptations, good moral instruction and mental food, be otherwise than\r\ngrieved at the promiscuous introduction among us of their writings?\r\n\r\nWe know that there are in France good men, pure books, true wit. But\r\nthere is an immensity that is bad, and more hurtful to our farmers,\r\nclerks and country milliners, than to those to whose tastes it was\r\noriginally addressed,--as the small-pox is most fatal among the wild\r\nmen of the woods,--and this, from the unprincipled cupidity of\r\npublishers, is broad-cast recklessly over all the land we had hoped\r\nwould become a healthy asylum for those before crippled and tainted by\r\nhereditary abuses. This cannot be prevented; we can only make head\r\nagainst it, and show that there is really another way of thinking and\r\nliving,--ay, and another voice for it in the world. We are naturally\r\non the alert, and if we sometimes start too quickly, that is better\r\nthan to play \"_Le noir Faineant_\"--(The Black Sluggard).\r\n\r\nWe are displeased at the unfeeling manner in which the _Courrier_\r\nspeaks of those whom he calls _our models_. He did not misunderstand\r\nus, and some things he says on this subject deserve and suggest a retort\r\nthat would be bitter. But we forbear, because it would injure the\r\ninnocent with the guilty. The _Courrier_ ranks the editor of\r\nthe _Tribune_ among \"the men who have undertaken an ineffectual\r\nstruggle against the perversities of this lower world.\" By _ineffectual_\r\nwe presume he means that it has never succeeded in exiling evil from\r\nthis lower world. We are proud to be ranked among the band of those\r\nwho at least, in the ever-memorable words of Scripture, have \"done what\r\nthey could\" for this purpose. To this band belong all good men of all\r\ncountries, and France has contributed no small contingent of those whose\r\npurpose was noble, whose lives were healthy, and whose minds, even in\r\ntheir lightest moods, pure. We are better pleased to act as sutler or\r\npursuivant of this band, whose strife the _Courrier_ thinks so\r\n_impuissante_, than to reap the rewards of efficiency on the other\r\nside. There is not too much of this salt, in proportion to the whole\r\nmass that needs to be salted, nor are \"occasional accesses of virtuous\r\nmisanthropy\" the worst of maladies in a world that affords such abundant\r\noccasion for it.\r\n\r\nIn fine, we disclaim all prejudice against the French nation. We feel\r\nassured that all, or almost all, impartial minds will acquiese in what\r\nwe say as to the tone of lax morality, in reference to marriage, so\r\ncommon in their literature. We do not like it, in joke or in earnest;\r\nneither are we of those to whom vice \"loses most of its deformity by\r\nlosing all its grossness.\" If there be a deep and ulcerated wound, we\r\nthink the more \"the richly-embroidered veil\" is torn away the better.\r\nSuch a deep social wound exists in France; we wish its cure, as we\r\nwish the health of all nations and of all men; so far indeed would we\r\n\"recoil towards a state of nature.\" We believe that nature wills\r\nmarriage and parentage to be kept sacred. The fact of their not being\r\nso is to us not a pleasant subject of jest; and we should really pity\r\nthe first lady of England for injury here, though she be a queen;\r\nwhile the ladies of the French court, or of Parisian society, if they\r\nwillingly lend themselves to be the subject of this style of jest, or\r\nfind it agreeable when made, must be to us the cause both of pity, and\r\ndisgust. We are not unaware of the great and beautiful qualities\r\nnative to the French--of their chivalry, their sweetness of temper,\r\ntheir rapid, brilliant and abundant genius. We would wish to see these\r\nqualities restored to their native lustre, and not receive the base\r\nalloy which has long stained the virginity of the gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON BOOKS OF TRAVEL.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: It need not be said, probably, that\r\nMargaret Fuller did not think the fact that books of travel by women\r\nhave generally been piquant and lively rather than discriminating and\r\ninstructive, a result of their nature, and therefore unavoidable; on\r\nthe contrary, she regarded woman as naturally more penetrating than\r\nman, and the fact that in journeying she would see more of home-life\r\nthan he, would give her a great advantage,--but she did believe woman\r\nneeded a wider culture, and then she would not fail to _excel_ in\r\nwriting books of travels. The merits now in such works she considered\r\nstriking and due to woman's natural quickness and availing herself of\r\nall her facilities, and any deficiencies simply proved the need of a\r\nbroader education.--[EDIT.]]\r\n\r\nAmong those we have, the best, as to observation of particulars and\r\nlively expression, are by women. They are generally ill prepared as\r\nregards previous culture, and their scope is necessarily narrower than\r\nthat of men, but their tact and quickness help them a great deal. You\r\ncan see their minds grow by what they feed on, when they travel. There\r\nare many books of travel, by women, that are, at least, entertaining,\r\nand contain some penetrating and just observations. There has, however,\r\nbeen none since Lady Mary Wortley Montague, with as much talent,\r\nliveliness, and preparation to observe in various ways, as she had.\r\n\r\nA good article appeared lately in one of the English periodicals,\r\nheaded by a long list of travels by women. It was easy to observe that\r\nthe personality of the writer was the most obvious thing in each and\r\nall of these books, and that, even in the best of them, you travelled\r\nwith the writer as a charming or amusing companion, rather than as an\r\naccomplished or instructed guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF \"MEMOIRS AND ESSAYS, BY MRS. JAMESON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Jameson appears to be growing more and more desperately modest,\r\nif we may judge from the motto:\r\n\r\n  \"What if the little rain should say,\r\n     'So small a drop as I\r\n   Can ne'er refresh the thirsty plain,--\r\n     I'll tarry in the sky'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand other superstitious doubts and disclaimers proffered in the course\r\nof the volume. We thought the time had gone by when it was necessary\r\nto plead \"request of friends\" for printing, and that it was understood\r\nnow-a-days that, from the facility of getting thoughts into print,\r\nliterature has become not merely an archive for the preservation of\r\ngreat thoughts, but a means of general communication between all\r\nclasses of minds, and all grades of culture.\r\n\r\nIf writers write much that is good, and write it well, they are read\r\nmuch and long; if the reverse, people simply pass them by, and go in\r\nsearch of what is more interesting. There needs be no great fuss about\r\npublishing or not publishing. Those who forbear may rather be\r\nconsidered the vain ones, who wish to be distinguished among the\r\ncrowd. Especially this extreme modesty looks superfluous in a person\r\nwho knows her thoughts have been received with interest for ten or\r\ntwelve years back. We do not like this from Mrs. Jameson, because we\r\nthink she would be amazed if others spoke of her as this little humble\r\nflower, doubtful whether it ought to raise its head to the light. She\r\nshould leave such affectations to her aunts; they were the fashion in\r\ntheir day.\r\n\r\nIt is very true, however, that she should _not_ have published\r\nthe very first paragraph in her book, which presents an inaccuracy and\r\nshallowness of thought quite amazing in a person of her fine\r\nperceptions, talent and culture. We allude to the contrast she\r\nattempts to establish between Raphael and Titian, in placing mind in\r\ncontradistinction to beauty, as if beauty were merely physical. Of\r\ncourse she means no such thing; but the passage means this or nothing,\r\nand, as an opening to a paper on art, is indeed reprehensible and\r\nfallacious.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this paper, called the House of Titian, is full of\r\npleasant chat, though some of the judgments--that passed on\r\nCanaletti's pictures, for instance--are opposed to those of persons of\r\nthe purest taste; and in other respects, such as in speaking of the\r\nrailroad to Venice, Mrs. Jameson is much less wise than those over\r\nwhom she assumes superiority. The railroad will destroy Venice; the\r\ntwo things cannot coexist; and those who do not look upon that\r\nwondrous dream in this age, will, probably, find only vestiges of its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe picture of Adelaide Kemble is very pretty, though there is an\r\nattempt of a sort too common with Mrs. Jameson to make more of the\r\nsubject than it deserves. Adelaide Kemble was not the true artist, or\r\nshe could not so soon or so lightly have stept into another sphere.\r\nIt is enough to paint her as a lovely woman, and a woman-genius. The\r\ntrue artist cannot forswear his vocation; Heaven does not permit it;\r\nthe attempt makes him too unhappy, nor will he form ties with those\r\nwho can consent to such sacrilege. Adelaide Kemble loved art, but was\r\nnot truly an artist.\r\n\r\nThe \"Xanthian Marbles,\" and \"Washington Allston,\" are very pleasing\r\npapers. The most interesting part, however, are the sentences copied\r\nfrom Mr. Allston. These have his chaste, superior tone. We copy some\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n\"What _light_ is in the natural world, such is _fame_ in the\r\nintellectual,--both requiring an _atmosphere_ in order to become\r\nperceptible. Hence the fame of Michel Angelo is to some minds a\r\nnonentity; even as the Sun itself would be invisible _in vacuo_\"\r\n\r\n(A very pregnant statement, containing the true reason why \"no man is\r\na hero to his valet de chambre.\")\r\n\r\n\"Fame does not depend on the will of any man; but reputation may be\r\ngiven and taken away; for fame is the sympathy of kindred intellects,\r\nand sympathy is not a subject of _willing_; while reputation,\r\nhaving its source in the popular voice, is a sentence which may be\r\naltered or suppressed at pleasure. Reputation, being essentially\r\ncontemporaneous, is always at the mercy of the envious and ignorant.\r\nBut Fame, whose very birth is posthumous, and which is only known to\r\nexist by the echoes of its footsteps through congenial minds, can\r\nneither be increased nor diminished by any degree of wilfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"An original mind is rarely understood until it has been\r\n_reflected_ from some half-dozen congenial with it; so averse are\r\nmen to admitting the true in an unusual form; while any novelty,\r\nhowever fantastic, however false, is greedily swallowed. Nor is this\r\nto be wondered at, for all truth demands a response, and few people\r\ncare to _think_, yet they must have something to supply the place\r\nof thought. Every mind would appear original if every man had the\r\npower of projecting his own into the minds of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"All effort at originality must end either in the quaint or monstrous;\r\nfor no man knows himself as on original; he can only believe it on the\r\nreport of others to whom he is made known, as he is by the projecting\r\npower before spoken of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an essential meanness in wishing to get the better of any\r\none. The only competition worthy of a wise man is with himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reverence is an ennobling sentiment; it is felt to be degrading only\r\nby the vulgar mind, which would escape the sense of its own littleness\r\nby elevating itself into the antagonist of what is above it.\"\r\n\r\n\"He that has no pleasure in looking up is not fit to look down; of\r\nsuch minds are the mannerists in art, and in the world--the tyrants of\r\nall sorts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make no man your idol; for the best man must have faults, and his\r\nfaults will naturally become yours, in addition to your own. This is\r\nas true in art as in morals.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Devil's heartiest laugh is at a detracting witticism. Hence the\r\nphrase 'devilish good' has sometimes a literal meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Woman's Mission and Woman's Position\" is an excellent paper, in which\r\nplain truths ere spoken with an honorable straight-forwardness, and a\r\ngreat deal of good feeling. We despise the woman who, knowing such\r\nfacts, is afraid to speak of them; yet we honor one, too, who does the\r\nplain right thing, for she exposes herself to the assaults of\r\nvulgarity, in a way painful to a person who has not strength to find\r\nshelter and repose in her motives. We recommend this paper to the\r\nconsideration of all those, the unthinking, wilfully unseeing million,\r\nwho are in the habit of talking of \"Woman's sphere,\" as if it really\r\nwere, at present, for the majority, one of protection, and the gentle\r\noffices of home. The rhetorical gentlemen and silken dames, who, quite\r\nforgetting their washerwomen, their seamstresses, and the poor\r\nhirelings for the sensual pleasures of Man, that jostle them daily in\r\nthe streets, talk as if women need be fitted for no other chance than\r\nthat of growing like cherished flowers in the garden of domestic love,\r\nare requested to look at this paper, in which the state of women, both\r\nin the manufacturing and agricultural districts of England, is exposed\r\nwith eloquence, and just inferences drawn.\r\n\r\n\"This, then, is what I mean when I speak of the anomalous condition of\r\nwomen in these days. I would point out, as a primary source of\r\nincalculable mischief, the contradiction between her assumed and her\r\nreal position; between what is called her proper sphere by the laws of\r\nGod and Nature, and what has become her real sphere by the laws of\r\nnecessity, and through the complex relations of artificial existence.\r\nIn the strong language of Carlyle, I would say that 'Here is a lie\r\nstanding up in the midst of society.' I would say 'Down with it, even\r\nto the ground;' for while this perplexing and barbarous anomaly\r\nexists, fretting like an ulcer at the very heart of society, all new\r\nspecifics and palliatives are in vain. The question must be settled\r\none way or another; either let the man in all the relations of life be\r\nheld the natural guardian of the woman, constrained to fulfil that\r\ntrust, responsible in society for her well-being and her maintenance;\r\nor, if she be liable to be thrust from the sanctuary of home, to\r\nprovide for herself through the exercise of such faculties as God has\r\ngiven her, let her at least have fair play; let it not be avowed, in\r\nthe same breath that protection is necessary to her, and that it is\r\nrefused her; and while we send her forth into the desert, and bind the\r\nburthen on her back, and put the staff in her hand, let not her steps\r\nbe beset, her limbs fettered, and her eyes blindfolded.\" Amen.\r\n\r\nThe sixth and last of these papers, on the relative social position of\r\n\"mothers and governesses,\" exhibits in true and full colors a state of\r\nthings in England, beside which the custom in some parts of China of\r\ndrowning female infants looks mild, generous, and refined;--an\r\naccursed state of things, beneath whose influence nothing can, and\r\nnothing ought to thrive. Though this paper, of which we have not\r\npatience to speak further at this moment, is valuable from putting the\r\nfacts into due relief, it is very inferior to the other, and shows the\r\nwant of thoroughness and depth in Mrs. Jameson's intellect. She has\r\ntaste, feeling and knowledge, but she cannot think out a subject\r\nthoroughly, and is unconsciously tainted and hampered by\r\nconventionalities. Her advice to the governesses reads like a piece of\r\nirony, but we believe it was not meant as such. Advise them to be\r\nburnt at the stake at once, rather than submit to this slow process of\r\npetrifaction. She is as bad as the Reports of the \"Society for the\r\nrelief of distressed and dilapidated Governesses.\" We have no more\r\npatience. We must go to England ourselves, and see these victims under\r\nthe water torture. Till then, a Dieu!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN'S INFLUENCE OVER THE INSANE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reference to what is said of entrusting an infant to the insane, we\r\nmust relate a little tale which touched the heart in childhood from\r\nthe eloquent lips of the mother.\r\n\r\nThe minister of the village had a son of such uncommon powers that the\r\nslender means on which the large family lived were strained to the\r\nutmost to send him to college. The boy prized the means of study as\r\nonly those under such circumstances know how to prize them; indeed,\r\nfar beyond their real worth; since, by excessive study, prolonged\r\noften at the expense of sleep, he made himself insane.\r\n\r\nAll may conceive the feelings of the family when their star returned\r\nto them again, shorn of its beams; their pride, their hard-earned\r\nhope, sunk to a thing so hopeless, so helpless, that there could be\r\nnone so poor to do him reverence. But they loved him, and did what the\r\nignorance of the time permitted. There was little provision then for\r\nthe treatment of such cases, and what there was was of a kind that\r\nthey shrunk from resorting to, if it could be avoided. They kept him\r\nat home, giving him, during the first months, the freedom of the\r\nhouse; but on his making an attempt to kill his father, and confessing\r\nafterwards that his old veneration had, as is so often the case in\r\nthese affections, reacted morbidly to its opposite, so that he never\r\nsaw a once-loved parent turn his back without thinking how he could\r\nrush upon him and do him an injury, they felt obliged to use harsher\r\nmeasures, and chained him to a post in one room of the house.\r\n\r\nThere, so restrained, without exercise or proper medicine, the fever\r\nof insanity came upon him in its wildest form. He raved, shrieked,\r\nstruck about him, and tore off all the raiment that was put upon him.\r\n\r\nOne of his sisters, named Lucy, whom he had most loved when well, had\r\nnow power to soothe him. He would listen to her voice, and give way to\r\na milder mood when she talked or sang. But this favorite sister\r\nmarried, went to her new home, and the maniac became wilder, more\r\nviolent than ever.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three years, she returned, bringing with her on infant.\r\nShe went into the room where the naked, blaspheming, raging object was\r\nconfined. He knew her instantly, and felt joy at seeing her.\r\n\r\n\"But, Lucy,\" said he, suddenly, \"is that your baby you have in your\r\narms? Give it to me, I want to hold it!\"\r\n\r\nA pang of dread and suspicion shot through the young mother's\r\nheart,--she turned pale and faint. Her brother was not at that moment\r\nso mad that he could not understand her fears.\r\n\r\n\"Lucy,\" said he, \"do you suppose I would hurt _your_ child?\"\r\n\r\nHis sister had strength of mind and of heart; she could not resist the\r\nappeal, and hastily placed the child in his arms. Poor fellow! he held\r\nit awhile, stroked its little face, and melted into tears, the first\r\nhe had shed since his insanity.\r\n\r\nFor some time after that he was better, and probably, had he been\r\nunder such intelligent care as may be had at present, the crisis might\r\nhave been followed up, and a favorable direction given to his disease.\r\nBut the subject was not understood then, and, having once fallen mad,\r\nhe was doomed to live and die a madman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM A CRITICISM ON BROWNING'S POEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * * \"The return of the Druses,\" a \"Blot in the 'Scutcheon,\" and\r\n\"Colombo's Birthday,\" all have the same originality of conception,\r\ndelicate penetration into the mysteries of human feeling, atmospheric\r\nindividuality, and skill in picturesque detail. All three exhibit very\r\nhigh and pure ideas of Woman, and a knowledge, very rare in man, of\r\nthe ways in which what is peculiar in her office and nature works. Her\r\nloftiest elevation does not, in his eyes, lift her out of nature. She\r\nbecomes, not a mere saint, but the goddess-queen of nature. Her purity\r\nis not cold, like marble, but the healthy, gentle energy of the\r\nflower, instinctively rejecting what is not fit for it, with no need\r\nof disdain to dig a gulf between it and the lower forms of creation.\r\nHer office to man is that of the muse, inspiring him to all good\r\nthoughts and deeds. The passions that sometimes agitate these maidens\r\nof his verso are the surprises of noble hearts unprepared for evil;\r\nand even their mistakes cannot cost bitter tears to their attendant\r\nangels.\r\n\r\nThe girl in the \"Return of the Druses\" is the sort of nature Byron\r\ntried to paint in Myrrha. But Byron could only paint women as they\r\nwere to him. Browning can show what they are in themselves. In \"A Blot\r\nin the 'Scutcheon,\" we see a lily, storm-struck, half-broken, but\r\nstill a lily. In \"Colombe's Birthday,\" a queenly rose-bud, which\r\nexpands into the full-glowing rose before our eyes. It is marvellous\r\nin this drama how the characters are unfolded to us by the crisis,\r\nwhich not only exhibits, but calls to life, the higher passions and\r\nthe thoughts which were latent within them.\r\n\r\nWe bless the poet for these pictures of women, which, however the\r\ncommon tone of society, by the grossness and levity of the remarks\r\nbandied from tongue to tongue, would seem to say to the contrary,\r\ndeclare there is still in the breasts of men a capacity for pure and\r\nexalting passion,--for immortal tenderness.\r\n\r\nOf Browning's delicate sheaths of meaning within meaning, which must\r\nbe opened slowly, petal by petal, as we seek the heart of a flower,\r\nand the spirit-like, distant breathings of his lute, familiar with the\r\nsecrets of shores distant and enchanted, a sense can only be gained by\r\nreading him a great deal; and we wish \"Bells and Pomegranates\" might\r\nbe brought within the reach of all who have time and soul to wait and\r\nlisten for such!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur festivals come rather too near together, since we have so few of\r\nthem;--Thanksgiving, Christmas-day, New-Years'-day, and then none\r\nagain till July. We know not but these four, with the addition of a\r\n\"day set apart for fasting and prayer,\" might answer the purposes of\r\nrest and edification as well as a calendar full of saints' days, if\r\nthey were observed in a better spirit. But, Thanksgiving is devoted to\r\ngood dinners; Christmas and New-Years' days to making presents and\r\ncompliments; Fast-day to playing at cricket and other games, and the\r\nFourth of July to boasting of the past, rather than to plans how to\r\ndeserve its benefits and secure its fruits.\r\n\r\nWe value means of marking time by appointed days, because man, on one\r\nside of his nature so ardent and aspiring, is on the other so indolent\r\nand slippery a being, that he needs incessant admonitions to redeem\r\nthe time. Time flows on steadily, whether _he_ regards it or not;\r\nyet, unless _he keep time_, there is no music in that flow. The\r\nsands drop with inevitable speed; yet each waits long enough to\r\nreceive, if it be ready, the intellectual touch that should turn it to\r\na sand of gold.\r\n\r\nTime, says the Grecian fable, is the parent of Power, Power is the\r\nfather of Genius and Wisdom. Time, then, is grandfather of the noblest\r\nof the human family; and we must respect the aged sire whom we see on\r\nthe frontispiece of the almanacs, and believe his scythe was meant to\r\nmow down harvests ripened for an immortal use.\r\n\r\nYet the best provision made by the mind of society at large for these\r\nadmonitions soon loses its efficacy, and requires that individual\r\nearnestness, individual piety, should continually reinforce the most\r\nbeautiful form. The world has never seen arrangements which might more\r\nnaturally offer good suggestions than those of the Church of Rome. The\r\nfounders of that church stood very near a history radiant at every\r\npage with divine light. All their rites and ceremonial days illustrate\r\nfacts of an universal interest. But the life with which piety first,\r\nand afterwards the genius of great artists, invested these symbols,\r\nwaned at last, except to a thoughtful few. Reverence was forgotten in\r\nthe multitude of genuflexions; the rosary became a string of beads\r\nrather than a series of religious meditations; and the \"glorious\r\ncompany of saints and martyrs\" were not regarded so much as the\r\nteachers of heavenly truth, as intercessors to obtain for their\r\nvotaries the temporal gifts they craved.\r\n\r\nYet we regret that some of those symbols had not been more reverenced\r\nby Protestants, as the possible occasion of good thoughts, and, among\r\nothers, we regret that the day set apart to commemorate the birth of\r\nJesus should have been stript, even by those who observe it, of many\r\nimpressive and touching accessories.\r\n\r\nIf ever there was an occasion on which the arts could become all but\r\nomnipotent in the service of a holy thought, it is this of the birth\r\nof the child Jesus. In the palmy days of the Catholic religion they\r\nmay be said to have wrought miracles in its behalf; and in our colder\r\ntime, when we rather reflect that light from a different point of view\r\nthan transport ourselves into it, who, that has an eye and ear\r\nfaithful to the soul, is not conscious of inexhaustible benefits from\r\nsome of the works by which sublime geniuses have expressed their\r\nideas?--in the adorations of the Magi and the Shepherds, in the Virgin\r\nwith the infant Jesus, or that work which expresses what Christendom\r\nat large has not begun to realize,--that work which makes us\r\nconscious, as we listen, why the soul of man was thought worthy and\r\nable to upbear a cross of such dreadful weight,--the Messiah of\r\nHandel.\r\n\r\nChristmas would seem to be the day peculiarly sacred to children; and\r\nsomething of this feeling is beginning to show itself among us, though\r\nrather from German influence than of native growth. The ever-green\r\ntree is often reared for the children on Christmas evening, and its\r\nbranches cluster with little tokens that may, at least, give them a\r\nsense that the world is rich, and that there are some in it who care\r\nto bless them. It is a charming sight to see their glistening eyes,\r\nand well worth much trouble in preparing the Christmas-tree.\r\n\r\nYet, on this occasion, as on all others, we should like to see\r\npleasure offered to them in a form less selfish than it is. When shall\r\nwe read of banquets prepared for the halt, the lame, and the blind, on\r\nthe day that is said to have brought _their_ friend into the\r\nworld? When will children be taught to ask all the cold and ragged\r\nlittle ones whom they have seen during the day wistfully gazing at the\r\nshop-windows, to share the joys of Christmas-eve?\r\n\r\nWe borrow the Christmas-tree from Germany; might we but borrow with it\r\nthat feeling which pervades all their stories, about the influence of\r\nthe Christ-child, and has, I doubt not (for the spirit of literature\r\nis always, though refined, the essence of popular life), pervaded the\r\nconduct of children there.\r\n\r\nWe will mention two of these as happily expressive of different sides\r\nof the desirable character. One is a legend of the saint Hermann\r\nJoseph. The legend runs that this saint, when a little boy, passed\r\ndaily by a niche where was an image of the Virgin and Child, and\r\ndelighted there to pay his devotions. His heart was so drawn towards\r\nthe holy child that one day, having received what seemed to him a gift\r\ntruly precious, a beautiful red and yellow apple, he ventured to offer\r\nit, with his prayer. To his unspeakable delight the child put forth\r\nhis hand and took the apple. After that day, never was a gift bestowed\r\nupon the little Hermann, that was not carried to the same place. He\r\nneeded nothing for himself, but dedicated all his childish goods to\r\nthe altar.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he was in trouble. His father, who was a poor man, found\r\nit necessary to take him from school, and bind him to a trade. He\r\ncommunicated his woes to his friends of the niche, and the Virgin\r\ncomforted him like a mother, and bestowed on him money, by means of\r\nwhich he rose to be a learned and tender Shepherd of men.\r\n\r\nAnother still more touching story is that of the holy Rupert. Rupert\r\nwas the only child of a princely house, and had something to give\r\nbesides apples. But his generosity and human love were such that, as a\r\nchild, he could never see poor children suffering without despoiling\r\nhimself of all he had with him in their behalf. His mother was, at\r\nfirst, displeased with this; but when he replied, \"They are thy\r\nchildren too,\" her reproofs yielded to tears.\r\n\r\nOne time, when he had given away his coat to a poor child, he got\r\nwearied and belated on his homeward way. He lay down a while and fell\r\nasleep. Then he dreamed that he was on a river-shore, and saw a mild\r\nand noble old man bathing many children. After he had plunged them\r\ninto the water, he would place them on a beautiful island, where they\r\nlooked white and glorious as little angels. Rupert was seized with a\r\nstrong desire to join them, and begged the old man to bathe him also\r\nin the stream. But he was answered, \"It is not yet time.\" Just then a\r\nrainbow spanned the island, and in its arch was enthroned the child\r\nJesus, dressed in a coat that Rupert knew to be his own. And the child\r\nsaid to the others, \"See this coat; it is one which my brother Rupert\r\nhas just sent to me. He has given us many gifts from his love; shall\r\nwe not ask him to join us here?\" And they shouted a musical \"Yes!\" and\r\nRupert started out of his dream. But he had lain too long on the damp\r\nbank of the river without his coat, and cold and fever soon sent him\r\nto join the band of his brothers in their home.\r\n\r\nThese are legends, superstitious, you will say.  But, in casting aside\r\nthe shell, have we retained the kernel? The image of the child Jesus\r\nis not seen in the open street. Does his heart find other means to\r\nexpress itself there? Protestantism does not mean, we suppose, to\r\ndeaden the spirit in excluding the form.\r\n\r\nThe thought of Jesus, as a child, has great weight with children who\r\nhave learned to think of him at all. In thinking of him they form an\r\nimage of all that the morning of a pure and fervent life should be and\r\nbring.\r\n\r\nIn former days I knew a boy-artist whose genius, at that time, showed\r\nhigh promise. He was not more than fourteen years old--a pale, slight\r\nboy, with a beaming eye. The hopes and sympathy of friends, gained by\r\nhis talent, had furnished him with a studio and orders for some\r\npictures. He had picked up from the streets a boy, still younger and\r\npoorer than himself, to take care of the room and prepare his colors,\r\nand the two boys were as content in their relation as Michael Angelo\r\nwith his Urbino. If you went there, you found exposed to view many\r\npretty pictures--\"A Girl with a Dove,\" \"The Guitar-player,\" and such\r\nsubjects as are commonly supposed to interest at his age. But, hid in\r\na corner, and never shown, unless to the beggar-page or some most\r\nconfidential friend, was the real object of his love and pride, the\r\nslowly-growing work of secret hours. The subject of this picture was\r\nChrist teaching the Doctors. And in those doctors he had expressed all\r\nhe had already observed of the pedantry and shallow conceit of those\r\nin whom mature years have not unfolded the soul: and in the child, all\r\nhe felt that early youth should be and seek, though, alas! his own\r\nfeet failed him on the difficult road. This one record of the youth of\r\nJesus, had, at least, been much to his mind.\r\n\r\nIn earlier days the little saints thought they best imitated the\r\nEmanuel by giving apples and cents; but we know not why, in our age,\r\nthat esteems itself so much enlightened, they should not become also\r\nthe givers of spiritual gifts. We see in them, continually, impulses\r\nthat only require a good direction to effect infinite good. See the\r\nlittle girls at work for foreign missions; that is not useless; they\r\ndevote the time to a purpose that is not selfish; the horizon of their\r\nthoughts is extended. But they are perfectly capable of becoming\r\nhome-missionaries as well. The principle of stewardship would make\r\nthem so.\r\n\r\nI have seen a little girl of thirteen, who had much service, too, to\r\ndo for a hard-working mother, in the midst of a circle of poor\r\nchildren whom she gathered daily to a morning school. She took them\r\nfrom the door-steps and the gutters; she washed their faces and hands;\r\nshe taught them to read and sew, and told them stories that had\r\ndelighted her own infancy. In her face, though in feature and\r\ncomplexion plain, was something already of a Madonna sweetness, and it\r\nhad no way eclipsed the gayety of childhood.\r\n\r\nI have seen a boy, scarce older, brought up for some time with the\r\nsons of laborers, who, so soon as he found himself possessed of\r\nsuperior advantages, thought not of surpassing others, but of\r\nexcelling that he might be able to impart; and he was able to do it.\r\nIf the other boys had less leisure, and could pay for less\r\ninstruction, they did not suffer by it. He could not be happy unless\r\nthey also could enjoy Milton, and pass from nature to natural\r\nphilosophy. He performed, though in a childish way, and in no Grecian\r\ngarb, the part of Apollo amidst the herdsmen of Admetus.\r\n\r\nThe cause of education would be indefinitely furthered if, in addition\r\nto formal means, there were but this principle awakened in the hearts\r\nof the young, that what they have they must bestow. All are not\r\nnatural instructors, but a large proportion are; and those who do\r\npossess such a talent are the best possible teachers to those a little\r\nyounger than themselves. Many have more patience with the difficulties\r\nthey have lately left behind, and enjoy their power of assisting more\r\nthan those further removed in age and knowledge do.\r\n\r\nThen the intercourse may be far more congenial and profitable than\r\nwhere the teacher receives for hire all sorts of pupils as they are\r\nsent him by their guardians. Here be need only choose those who have a\r\npredisposition for what he is best able to teach; and, as I would have\r\nthe so-called higher instruction as much diffused in this way as the\r\nlower, there would be a chance of awakening all the power that now\r\nlies latent.\r\n\r\nIf a girl, for instance, who has only a passable talent for music, but\r\nwho, from the advantage of social position, has been able to gain\r\nthorough instruction, felt it her duty to teach whomsoever she know\r\nthat had a talent without money to cultivate it, the good is obvious.\r\n\r\nThose who are learning, receive an immediate benefit by the effort to\r\nrearrange and interpret what they learn; so the use of this justice\r\nwould be two-fold.\r\n\r\nSome efforts are made here and there; nay, sometimes there are those\r\nwho can say they have returned usury for every gift of fate; and would\r\nothers make the same experiments, they might find Utopia not so far\r\noff as the children of this world, wise in securing their own selfish\r\nease, would persuade us it must always be.\r\n\r\nWe have hinted what sort of Christmas-box we would wish for the\r\nchildren; it must be one as full, as that of the Christ-child must be,\r\nof the pieces of silver that were lost and are found. But Christmas\r\nwith its peculiar associations has deep interest for men and women no\r\nless. At that time thus celebrated, a pure woman saw in her child what\r\nthe Son of man should be as a child of God. She anticipated fur him a\r\nlife of glory to God, peace and good-will towards men. In any young\r\nmother's heart, who has any purity of heart, the same feelings arise.\r\nBut most of these mothers carelessly let them go without obeying their\r\ninstructions. If they did not, we should see other children, other men\r\nthan now throng our streets. The boy could not invariably disappoint\r\nthe mother, the man the wife, who steadily demanded of him such a\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nAnd Man looks upon Woman, in this relation, always as he should. Does\r\nhe see in her a holy mother, worthy to guard the infancy of an\r\nimmortal soul? Then she assumes in his eyes those traits which the\r\nRomish church loved to revere in Mary. Frivolity, base appetite,\r\ncontempt, are exorcised, and Man and Woman appear again, in unprofaned\r\nconnection, as brother and sister, children and servants of one Divine\r\nLove, and pilgrims to a common aim.\r\n\r\nWere all this right in the private sphere, the public would soon right\r\nitself also, and the nations of Christendom might join in a\r\ncelebration such as \"Kings and Prophets waited for,\" and so many\r\nmartyrs died to achieve, of Christ-mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILDREN'S BOOKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of literature that better deserves cultivation, and\r\nnone that so little obtains it from worthy hands, as this of\r\nChildren's Books. It requires a peculiar development of the genius and\r\nsympathies, rare among men of factitious life, who are not men enough\r\nto revive with force and beauty the thoughts and scenes of childhood.\r\n\r\nIt is all idle to talk baby-talk, and give shallow accounts of deep\r\nthings, thinking thereby to interest the child. He does not like to be\r\ntoo much puzzled; but it is simplicity be wants, not silliness. We\r\nfancy their angels, who are always waiting in the courts of our\r\nFather, smile somewhat sadly on the ignorance of those who would feed\r\nthem on milk and water too long, and think it would be quite as well\r\nto give them a stone.\r\n\r\nThere is too much amongst us of the French way of palming off false\r\naccounts of things on children, \"to do them good,\" and showing nature\r\nto them in a magic lantern \"purified for the use of childhood,\" and\r\ntelling stories of sweet little girls and brave little boys,--O, all\r\nso good, or so bad! and above all, so _little_, and everything\r\nabout them so little! Children accustomed to move in full-sized\r\napartments, and converse with full-grown men and women, do not need so\r\nmuch of this baby-house style in their literature. They like, or would\r\nlike if they could get them, better things much more. They like the\r\n_Arabian Nights_, and _Pilgrim's Progress_, and _Bunyan's\r\nEmblems_, and _Shakspeare_, and the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_,--at least,\r\nthey used to like them; and if they do not now, it is because their\r\ntaste has been injured by so many sugar-plums. The books that were\r\nwritten in the childhood of nations suit an uncorrupted childhood now.\r\nThey are simple, picturesque, robust. Their moral is not forced, nor\r\nis the truth veiled with a well-meant but sure-to-fail hypocrisy.\r\nSometimes they are not moral at all,--only free plays of the fancy\r\nand intellect. These, also, the child needs, just as the infant needs\r\nto stretch its limbs, and grasp at objects it cannot hold. We have\r\nbecome so fond of the moral, that we forget the nature in which it\r\nmust find its root; so fond of instruction, that we forget development.\r\n\r\nWhere ballads, legends, fairy-tales, are moral, the morality is\r\nheart-felt; if instructive, it is from the healthy common sense of\r\nmankind, and not for the convenience of nursery rule, nor the \"peace\r\nof schools and families.\"\r\n\r\nO, that winter, freezing, snow-laden winter, which ushered in our\r\neighth birthday! There, in the lonely farm-house, the day's work done,\r\nand the bright woodfire all in a glow, we were permitted to slide back\r\nthe panel of the cupboard in the wall,--most fascinating object still\r\nin our eyes, with which no stateliest alcoved library can vie,--and\r\nthere saw, neatly ranged on its two shelves, not--praised be our natal\r\nstar!--_Peter Parley_, nor a History of the Good Little Boy who\r\nnever took anything that did not belong to him; but the\r\n_Spectator_, _Telemachus_, _Goldsmith's Animated\r\nNature_, and the _Iliad_.\r\n\r\nForms of gods and heroes more distinctly seen, and with eyes of nearer\r\nlove then than now!--our true uncle, Sir Roger de Coverley, and ye,\r\nfair realms of Nature's history, whose pictures we tormented all grown\r\npersons to illustrate with more knowledge, still more,--how we bless\r\nthe chance that gave to us your great realities, which life has daily\r\nhelped us, helps us still, to interpret, instead of thin and baseless\r\nfictions that would all this time have hampered us, though with only\r\ncobwebs!\r\n\r\nChildren need some childish talk, some childish play, some childish\r\nbooks. But they also need, and need more, difficulties to overcome,\r\nand a sense of the vast mysteries which the progress of their\r\nintelligence shall aid them to unravel. This sense is naturally their\r\ndelight, as it is their religion, and it must not be dulled by\r\npremature explanations or subterfuges of any kind. There has been too\r\nmuch of this lately.\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth is an excellent writer for children. She is a child\r\nherself, as she writes, nursed anew by her own genius. It is not by\r\nimitating, but by reproducing childhood, that the writer becomes its\r\ncompanion. Then, indeed, we have something especially good, for,\r\n\r\n  \"Like wine, well-kept and long,\r\n     Heady, nor harsh, nor strong,\r\n   With each succeeding year is quaffed,\r\n     A richer, purer, mellower draught.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Edgeworth's grown people live naturally with the children; they\r\ndo not talk to them continually about angels or flowers, but about the\r\nthings that interest themselves. They do not force them forward, nor\r\nkeep them back. The relations are simple and honorable; all ages in\r\nthe family seem at home under one roof and sheltered by one care.\r\n\r\nThe _Juvenile Miscellany_, formerly published by Mrs. Child, was\r\nmuch and deservedly esteemed by children. It was a healthy, cheerful,\r\nnatural and entertaining companion to them.\r\n\r\nWe should censure too monotonously tender a manner in what is written\r\nfor children, and too constant an attention to moral influence. We\r\nshould prefer a larger proportion of the facts of natural or human\r\nhistory, and that they should speak for themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMAN IN POVERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWoman, even less than Man, is what she should be as a whole. She is\r\nnot that self-centred being, full of profound intuitions, angelic\r\nlove, and flowing poesy, that she should be. Yet there are\r\ncircumstances in which the native force and purity of her being teach\r\nher how to conquer where the restless impatience of Man brings defeat,\r\nand leaves him crushed and bleeding on the field.\r\n\r\nImages rise to mind of calm strength, of gentle wisdom learning from\r\nevery turn of adverse fate,--of youthful tenderness and faith undimmed\r\nto the close of life, which redeem humanity and make the heart glow\r\nwith fresh courage as we write. They are mostly from obscure corners\r\nand very private walks. There was nothing shining, nothing of an\r\nobvious and sounding heroism to make their conduct doubtful, by\r\ntainting their motives with vanity. Unknown they lived, untrumpeted\r\nthey died. Many hearts were warmed and fed by them, but perhaps no\r\nmind but our own ever consciously took account of their virtues.\r\n\r\nHad Art but the power adequately to tell their simple virtues, and to\r\ncast upon them the light which, shining through those marked and faded\r\nfaces, foretold the glories of a second spring! The tears of holy\r\nemotion which fell from those eyes have seemed to us pearls beyond all\r\nprice; or rather, whose price will be paid only when, beyond the\r\ngrave, they enter those better spheres in whose faith they felt and\r\nacted here.\r\n\r\nFrom this private gallery we will, for the present, bring forth but\r\none picture. That of a Black Nun was wont to fetter the eyes of\r\nvisitors in the royal galleries of France, and my Sister of Mercy,\r\ntoo, is of that complexion. The old woman was recommended as a\r\nlaundress by my friend, who had long prized her. I was immediately\r\nstruck with the dignity and propriety of her manner. In the depth of\r\nwinter she brought herself the heavy baskets through the slippery\r\nstreets; and, when I asked her why she did not employ some younger\r\nperson to do what was so entirely disproportioned to her strength,\r\nsimply said, \"she lived alone, and could not afford to hire an\r\nerrand-boy.\" \"It was hard for her?\" \"No, she was fortunate in being\r\nable to get work at her age, when others could do it better. Her\r\nfriends were very good to procure it for her.\" \"Had she a comfortable\r\nhome?\" \"Tolerably so,--she should not need one long.\" \"Was that a\r\nthought of joy to her?\" \"Yes, for she hoped to see again the husband\r\nand children from whom she had long been separated.\"\r\n\r\nThus much in answer to the questions, but at other times the little\r\nshe said was on general topics. It was not from her that I learnt how\r\nthe great idea of Duty had held her upright through a life of\r\nincessant toil, sorrow, bereavement; and that not only she had\r\nremained upright, but that her character had been constantly\r\nprogressive. Her latest act had been to take home a poor sick girl who\r\nhad no home of her own, and could not bear the idea of dying in a\r\nhospital, and maintain and nurse her through the last weeks of her\r\nlife. \"Her eye-sight was failing, and she should not be able to work\r\nmuch longer,--but, then, God would provide. _Somebody_ ought to\r\nsee to the poor, motherless girl.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not merely the greatness of the act, for one in such\r\ncircumstances, but the quiet matter-of-course way in which it was\r\ndone, that showed the habitual tone of the mind, and made us feel that\r\nlife could hardly do more for a human being than to make him or her\r\nthe _somebody_ that is daily so deeply needed, to represent the\r\nright, to do the plain right thing.\r\n\r\n\"God will provide.\" Yes, it is the poor who feel themselves near to\r\nthe God of love. Though he slay them, still do they trust him.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said I to a poor apple-woman, who had been drawn on to\r\ndisclose a tale of distress that, almost in the mere hearing, made me\r\nweary of life, \"I hope I may yet see you in a happier condition.\"\r\n\"With God's help,\" she replied, with a smile that Raphael would have\r\ndelighted to transfer to his canvas; a Mozart, to strains of angelic\r\nsweetness. All her life she had seemed an outcast child; still she\r\nleaned upon a Father's love.\r\n\r\nThe dignity of a state like this may vary its form in, more or less\r\nrichness and beauty of detail, but here is the focus of what makes\r\nlife valuable. It is this spirit which makes poverty the best servant\r\nto the ideal of human nature. I am content with this type, and will\r\nonly quote, in addition, a ballad I found in a foreign periodical,\r\ntranslated from Chamisso, and which forcibly recalled my own laundress\r\nas an equally admirable sample of the same class, the Ideal Poor,\r\nwhich we need for our consolation, so long as there must be real\r\npoverty.\r\n\r\n  \"THE OLD WASHERWOMAN.\r\n\r\n  \"Among yon lines her hands have laden,\r\n    A laundress with white hair appears,\r\n  Alert as many a youthful maiden,\r\n    Spite of her five-and-seventy years;\r\n  Bravely she won those white hairs, still\r\n    Eating the bread hard toll obtained her,\r\n  And laboring truly to fulfil\r\n    The duties to which God ordained her.\r\n\r\n  \"Once she was young and full of gladness,\r\n    She loved and hoped,--was wooed and won;\r\n  Then came the matron's cares,--the sadness\r\n    No loving heart on earth may shun.\r\n  Three babes she bore her mate; she prayed\r\n    Beside his sick-bed,--he was taken;\r\n  She saw him in the church-yard laid,\r\n    Yet kept her faith and hope unshaken.\r\n\r\n  \"The task her little ones of feeding\r\n    She met unfaltering from that hour;\r\n  She taught them thrift and honest breeding,\r\n    Her virtues were their worldly dower.\r\n  To seek employment, one by one,\r\n    Forth with her blessing they departed,\r\n  And she was in the world alone--\r\n    Alone and old, but still high-hearted.\r\n\r\n  \"With frugal forethought; self-denying,\r\n    She gathered coin, and flax she bought,\r\n  And many a night her spindle plying,\r\n    Good store of fine-spun thread she wrought.\r\n  The thread was fashioned in the loom;\r\n    She brought it home, and calmly seated\r\n  To work, with not a thought of gloom,\r\n    Her decent grave-clothes she completed.\r\n\r\n  \"She looks on them with fond elation;\r\n    They are her wealth, her treasure rare,\r\n  Her age's pride and consolation,\r\n    Hoarded with all a miser's care.\r\n  She dons the sark each Sabbath day,\r\n    To hear the Word that falleth never!\r\n  Well-pleased she lays it then away\r\n    Till she shall sleep in it forever!\r\n\r\n  \"Would that my spirit witness bore me.\r\n    That, like this woman, I had done\r\n  The work my Master put before me\r\n    Duly from morn till set of sun!\r\n  Would that life's cup had been by me\r\n    Quaffed in such wise and happy measure,\r\n  And that I too might finally\r\n    Look on my shroud with such meek pleasure!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the noble of the earth. They do not repine, they do not\r\nchafe, even in the inmost heart. They feel that, whatever else may be\r\ndenied or withdrawn, there remains the better part, which cannot be\r\ntaken from them. This line exactly expresses the woman I knew:--\r\n\r\n  \"Alone and old, but still high-hearted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWill any, poor or rich, fail to feel that the children of such a\r\nparent were rich when\r\n\r\n  \"Her virtues were their worldly dower\"?\r\n\r\n\r\nWill any fail to bow the heart in assent to the aspiration,\r\n\r\n  \"Would that my spirit witness bore me\r\n    That, like this woman, I had done\r\n  The work my Maker put before me\r\n    Duly from morn till set of sun\"?\r\n\r\n\r\nMay not that suffice to any man's ambition?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Perhaps one of the most perplexing problems which beset Woman in her\r\ndomestic sphere relates to the proper care and influence which she\r\nshould exert over the domestic aids she employs. As these are, and\r\nlong must be, taken chiefly from one nation, the following pages\r\ntreating of the Irish Character, and the true relation between\r\nEmployer and Employed, can hardly fail to be of interest. They\r\ncontain, too, some considerations which Woman as well as Man is too\r\nmuch in danger of overlooking, and which seem, even more than when\r\nfirst urged, to be timely in this reactionary to-day.--ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn one of the eloquent passages quoted in the \"_Tribune_\" of\r\nWednesday, under the head, \"Spirit of the Irish Press,\" we find these\r\nwords:\r\n\r\n\"Domestic love, almost morbid from external suffering, prevents him\r\n(the Irishman) from becoming a fanatic and a misanthrope, and\r\nreconciles him to life.\"\r\n\r\nThis recalled to our mind the many touching instances known to us of\r\nsuch traits among the Irish we have seen here. We have known instances\r\nof morbidness like this. A girl sent \"home,\" after she was well\r\nestablished herself, for a young brother, of whom she was particularly\r\nfond. He came, and shortly after died. She was so overcome by his loss\r\nthat she took poison. The great poet of serious England says, and we\r\nbelieve it to be his serious thought though laughingly said, \"Men have\r\ndied, and worms have eaten them, but not for love.\" Whether or not\r\ndeath may follow from the loss of a lover or child, we believe that\r\namong no people but the Irish would it be upon the loss of a young\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nAnother poor young woman, in the flower of her youth, denied herself,\r\nnot only every pleasure, but almost the necessaries of life to save\r\nthe sum she thought ought to be hers before sending to Ireland for a\r\nwidowed mother. Just as she was on the point of doing so she heard\r\nthat her mother had died fifteen months before. The keenness and\r\npersistence of her grief defy description. With a delicacy of feeling\r\nwhich showed the native poetry of the Irish mind, she dwelt, most of\r\nall, upon the thought that while she was working, and pinching, and\r\ndreaming of happiness with her mother, it was indeed but a dream, and\r\nthat cherished parent lay still and cold beneath the ground. She felt\r\nfully the cruel cheat of Fate. \"Och! and she was dead all those times\r\nI was thinking of her!\" was the deepest note of her lament.\r\n\r\nThey are able, however, to make the sacrifice of even these intense\r\nfamily affections in a worthy cause. We knew a woman who postponed\r\nsending for her only child, whom she had left in Ireland, for years,\r\nwhile she maintained a sick friend who had no one else to help her.\r\n\r\nThe poetry of which I have spoken shows itself even here, where they\r\nare separated from old romantic associations, and begin the new life\r\nin the New World by doing all its drudgery. We know flights of poetry\r\nrepeated to us by those present at their wakes,--passages of natural\r\neloquence, from the lamentations for the dead, more beautiful than\r\nthose recorded in the annals of Brittany or Roumelia.\r\n\r\nIt is the same genius, so exquisitely mournful, tender, and glowing,\r\ntoo, with the finest enthusiasm, that makes their national music, in\r\nthese respects, the finest in the world. It is the music of the harp;\r\nits tones are deep and thrilling. It is the harp so beautifully\r\ndescribed in \"The Harp of Tara's Halls,\" a song whose simple pathos is\r\nunsurpassed. A feeling was never more adequately embodied.\r\n\r\nIt is the genius which will enable Emmet's appeal to draw tears from\r\nthe remotest generations, however much they may be strangers to the\r\ncircumstances which called it forth, It is the genius which beamed in\r\nchivalrous loveliness through each act of Lord Edward Fitzgerald,--the\r\ngenius which, ripened by English culture, favored by suitable\r\noccasions, has shed such glory on the land which has done all it could\r\nto quench it on the parent hearth.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider all the fire which glows so untamably in Irish veins,\r\nthe character of her people, considering the circumstances, almost\r\nmiraculous in its goodness, we cannot forbear, notwithstanding all the\r\ntemporary ills they aid in here, to give them a welcome to our shores.\r\nThose ills we need not enumerate; they are known to all, and we rank\r\namong them, what others would not, that by their ready service to do\r\nall the hard work, they make it easier for the rest of the population\r\nto grow effeminate, and help the country to grow too fast. But that is\r\nher destiny, to grow too fast: there is no use talking against it.\r\nTheir extreme ignorance, their blind devotion to their priesthood,\r\ntheir pliancy in the hands of demagogues, threaten continuance of\r\nthese ills; yet, on the other hand, we must regard them as most\r\nvaluable elements in the new race. They are looked upon with contempt\r\nfor their wont of aptitude in learning new things; their ready and\r\ningenious lying; their eye-service. These are the faults of an\r\noppressed race, which must require the aid of better circumstances\r\nthrough two or three generations to eradicate. Their virtues are their\r\nown; they are many, genuine, and deeply-rooted. Can an impartial\r\nobserver fail to admire their truth to domestic ties, their power of\r\ngenerous bounty, and more generous gratitude, their indefatigable\r\ngood-humor (for ages of wrong which have driven them to so many acts\r\nof desperation, could never sour their blood at its source), their\r\nready wit, their elasticity of nature? They are fundamentally one of\r\nthe best nations of the world. Would they were welcomed here, not to\r\nwork merely, but to intelligent sympathy, and efforts, both patient\r\nand ardent, for the education of their children! No sympathy could be\r\nbetter deserved, no efforts wiselier timed. Future Burkes and Currans\r\nwould know how to give thanks for them, and Fitzgeralds rise upon the\r\nsoil--which boasts the magnolia with its kingly stature and majestical\r\nwhite blossoms,--to the same lofty and pure beauty. Will you not\r\nbelieve it, merely because that bog-bred youth you placed in the\r\nmud-hole tells you lies, and drinks to cheer himself in those endless\r\ndiggings? You are short-sighted, my friend; you do not look to the\r\nfuture; you will not turn your head to see what may have been the\r\ninfluences of the past. You have not examined your own breast to see\r\nwhether the monitor there has not commanded you to do your part to\r\ncounteract these influences; and yet the Irishman appeals to you, eye\r\nto eye. He is very personal himself,--he expects a personal interest\r\nfrom you. Nothing has been able to destroy this hope, which was the\r\nfruit of his nature. We were much touched by O'Connell's direct appeal\r\nto the queen, as \"Lady!\" But she did not listen,--and we fear few\r\nladies and gentlemen will till the progress of Destiny compels them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IRISH CHARACTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the publication of a short notice under this head in the\r\n\"_Tribune_,\" several persons have expressed to us that their\r\nfeelings were awakened on the subject, especially as to their\r\nintercourse with the lower Irish. Most persons have an opportunity of\r\nbecoming acquainted, if they will, with the lower classes of Irish, as\r\nthey are so much employed among us in domestic service, and other\r\nkinds of labor.\r\n\r\nWe feel, say these persons, the justice of what has been said as to\r\nthe duty and importance of improving these people. We have sometimes\r\ntried; but the want of real gratitude which, in them, is associated\r\nwith such warm and wordy expressions of regard, with their\r\nincorrigible habits of falsehood and evasion, have baffled and\r\ndiscouraged us. You say their children ought to be educated; but how\r\ncan this be effected when the all but omnipotent sway of the Catholic\r\nreligion and the example of parents are both opposed to the formation\r\nof such views and habits as we think desirable to the citizen of the\r\nNew World?\r\n\r\nWe answer first with regard to those who have grown up in another\r\nland, and who, soon after arriving here, are engaged in our service.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to ingratitude. We cannot but sadly smile on the remarks we\r\nhear so often on this subject.\r\n\r\nJust Heaven!--and to us how liberal! which has given those who speak\r\nthus an unfettered existence, free from religious or political\r\noppression; which has given them the education of intellectual and\r\nrefined intercourse with men to develop those talents which make them\r\nrich in thoughts and enjoyment, perhaps in money, too, certainly rich\r\nin comparison with the poor immigrants they employ,--what is thought\r\nin thy clear light of those who expect in exchange for a few shillings\r\nspent in presents or medicines, a few kind words, a little casual\r\nthought or care, such a mighty payment of gratitude? Gratitude! Under\r\nthe weight of old feudalism their minds were padlocked by habit\r\nagainst the light; they might be grateful then, for they thought their\r\nlords were as gods, of another frame and spirit than theirs, and that\r\nthey had no right to have the same hopes and wants, scarcely to suffer\r\nfrom the same maladies, with those creatures of silk, and velvet, and\r\ncloth of gold. Then, the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table\r\nmight be received with gratitude, and, if any but the dogs came to\r\ntend the beggar's sores, such might be received as angels. But the\r\ninstitutions which sustained such ideas have fallen to pieces. It is\r\nunderstood, even In Europe, that\r\n\r\n  \"The rank is but the guinea's stamp,\r\n   The man's the gowd for a' that,\r\n     A man's a man for a' that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd being such, has a claim on this earth for something better than\r\nthe nettles of which the French peasantry made their soup, and with\r\nwhich the persecuted Irish, \"under hiding,\" turned to green the lips\r\nwhite before with famine.\r\n\r\nAnd if this begins to be understood in Europe, can you suppose it is\r\nnot by those who, hearing that America opens a mother's arms with the\r\ncry, \"All men are born free and equal,\" rush to her bosom to be\r\nconsoled for centuries of woe, for their ignorance, their hereditary\r\ndegradation, their long memories of black bread and stripes? However\r\nlittle else they may understand, believe they understand well _this\r\nmuch_. Such inequalities of privilege, among men all born of one\r\nblood, should not exist. They darkly feel that those to whom much has\r\nbeen given owe to the Master an account of stewardship. They know now\r\nthat your gift is but a small portion of their right.\r\n\r\nAnd you, O giver! how did you give? With religious joy, as one who\r\nknows that he who loves God cannot fail to love his neighbor as\r\nhimself? with joy and freedom, as one who feels that it is the highest\r\nhappiness of gift to us that we have something to give again? Didst\r\nthou put thyself into the position of the poor man, and do for him\r\nwhat thou wouldst have had one who was able to do for thee? Or, with\r\naffability and condescending sweetness, made easy by internal delight\r\nat thine own wondrous virtue, didst thou give five dollars to balance\r\nfive hundred spent on thyself? Did you say, \"James, I shall expect you\r\nto do right in everything, and to attend to my concerns as I should\r\nmyself; and, at the end of the quarter, I will give you my old clothes\r\nand a new pocket-handkerchief, besides seeing that your mother is\r\nprovided with fuel against Christmas?\"\r\n\r\nLine upon line, and precept upon precept, the tender parent expects\r\nfrom the teacher to whom he confides his child; vigilance unwearied,\r\nday and night, through long years. But he expects the raw Irish girl\r\nor boy to correct, at a single exhortation, the habit of deceiving\r\nthose above them, which the expectation of being tyrannized over has\r\nrooted in their race for ages. If we look fairly into the history of\r\ntheir people, and the circumstances under which their own youth was\r\ntrained, we cannot expect that anything short of the most steadfast\r\npatience and love can enlighten them as to the beauty and value of\r\nimplicit truth, and, having done so, fortify and refine them in the\r\npractice of it.\r\n\r\nThis we admit at the outset: First, You must be prepared for a\r\nreligious and patient treatment of these people, not merely\r\n_un_educated, but _ill_-educated; a treatment far more religious\r\nand patient than is demanded by your own children, if they were born\r\nand bred under circumstances at all favorable.\r\n\r\nSecond, Dismiss from your minds all thought of gratitude. Do what you\r\ndo for them for God's sake, and as a debt to humanity--interest to the\r\ncommon creditor upon principal left in your care. Then insensibility,\r\nforgetfulness, or relapse, will not discourage you, and you will\r\nwelcome proofs of genuine attachment to yourself chiefly as tokens\r\nthat your charge has risen into a higher state of thought and feeling,\r\nso as to be enabled to value the benefits conferred through you. Could\r\nwe begin so, there would be hope of our really becoming the\r\ninstructors and guardians of this swarm of souls which come from their\r\nregions of torment to us, hoping, at least, the benefits of purgatory.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Catholic priesthood must continue very great till\r\nthere is a complete transfusion of character in the minds of their\r\ncharge. But as the Irishman, or any other foreigner, becomes\r\nAmericanized, he will demand a new form of religion to suit his new\r\nwants. The priest, too, will have to learn the duties of an American\r\ncitizen; he will live less and less for the church, and more for the\r\npeople, till at last, if there be Catholicism still, it will be under\r\nProtestant influences, as begins to be the case in Germany. It will\r\nbe, not Roman, but American Catholicism; a form of worship which\r\nrelies much, perhaps, on external means and the authority of the\r\nclergy,--for such will always be the case with religion while there\r\nare crowds of men still living an external life, and who have not\r\nlearned to make full use of their own faculties,--but where a belief\r\nin the benefits of confession and the power of the church, as church,\r\nto bind and loose, atone for or decide upon sin, with similar\r\ncorruptions, must vanish in the free and searching air of a new era.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween employer and employed there is not sufficient pains taken on\r\nthe part of the former to establish a mutual understanding. People\r\nmeet, in the relations of master and servant, who have lived in two\r\ndifferent worlds. In this respect we are much worse situated than the\r\nsame parties have been in Europe. There is less previous acquaintance\r\nbetween the upper and lower classes. (We must, though unwillingly, use\r\nthese terms to designate the state of things as at present existing.)\r\nMeals are taken separately; work is seldom shared; there is very\r\nlittle to bring the parties together, except sometimes the farmer\r\nworks with his hired Irish laborer in the fields, or the mother keeps\r\nthe nurse-maid of her baby in the room with her.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things the chances for instruction, which come every\r\nday of themselves where parties share a common life instead of its\r\nresults merely, do not occur. Neither is there opportunity to\r\nadminister instruction in the best manner, nor to understand when and\r\nwhere it is needed.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who works with his men in the field, the farmer's wife who\r\nattends with her women to the churn and the oven, may, with ease, be\r\ntrue father and mother to all who are in their employ, and enjoy\r\nhealth of conscience in the relation, secure that, if they find cause\r\nfor blame, it is not from faults induced by their own negligence. The\r\nmerchant who is from home all day, the lady receiving visitors or\r\nworking slippers in her nicely-furnished parlor, cannot be quite so\r\nsure that their demands, or the duties involved in them, are clearly\r\nunderstood, nor estimate the temptations to prevarication.\r\n\r\nIt is shocking to think to what falsehoods human beings like ourselves\r\nwill resort, to excuse a love of amusement, to hide ill-health, while\r\nthey see us indulging freely in the one, yielding lightly to the\r\nother; and yet we have, or ought to have, far more resources in either\r\ntemptation than they. For us it is hard to resist, to give up going to\r\nthe places where we should meet our most interesting companions, or do\r\nour work with an aching brow. But we have not people over us whose\r\ncareless, hasty anger drives us to seek excuses for our failures; if\r\nso, perhaps,--perhaps; who knows?--we, the better-educated, rigidly,\r\nimmaculately true as we are at present, _might_ tell falsehoods.\r\nPerhaps we might, if things were given us to do which we had never\r\nseen done, if we were surrounded by new arrangements in the nature of\r\nwhich no one instructed us. All this we must think of before we can be\r\nof much use.\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the nursery-maid as _the_ hired domestic with\r\nwhom her mistress, or even the master, is likely to become acquainted.\r\nBut, only a day or two since, we saw, what we see so often, a\r\nnursery-maid with the family to which she belonged, in a public\r\nconveyance. They were having a pleasant time; but in it she had no\r\npart, except to hold a hot, heavy baby, and receive frequent\r\nadmonitions to keep _it_ comfortable. No inquiry was made as to\r\n_her_ comfort; no entertaining remark, no information of interest\r\nas to the places we passed, was addressed to her. Had she been in that\r\nway with that family ten years she might have known _them_ well\r\nenough, for their characters lay only too bare to a careless scrutiny;\r\nbut her joys, her sorrows, her few thoughts, her almost buried\r\ncapacities, would have been as unknown to them, and they as little\r\nlikely to benefit her, as the Emperor of China.\r\n\r\nLet the employer place the employed first in good physical\r\ncircumstances, so as to promote the formation of different habits from\r\nthose of the Irish hovel, or illicit still-house. Having thus induced\r\nfeelings of self-respect, he has opened the door for a new set of\r\nnotions. Then let him become acquainted with the family circumstances\r\nand history of his new pupil. He has now got some ground on which to\r\nstand for intercourse. Let instruction follow for the mind, not merely\r\nby having the youngest daughter set, now and then, copies in the\r\nwriting-book, or by hearing read aloud a few verses in the Bible, but\r\nby putting good books in their way, if able to read, and by\r\nintelligent conversation when there is a chance,--the master with the\r\nman who is driving him, the lady with the woman who is making her bed.\r\nExplain to them the relations of objects around them; teach them to\r\ncompare the old with the new life. If you show a better way than\r\ntheirs of doing work, teach them, too, _why_ it is better. Thus\r\nwill the mind be prepared by development for a moral reformation;\r\nthere will be some soil fitted to receive the seed.\r\n\r\nWhen the time is come,--and will you think a poor, uneducated person,\r\nin whose mind the sense of right and wrong is confused, the sense of\r\nhonor blunted, easier of access than one refined and thoughtful?\r\nSurely you will not, if you yourself are refined and thoughtful, but\r\nrather that the case requires far more care in the choice of a\r\nfavorable opportunity,--when, then, the good time is come, perhaps it\r\nwill be best to do what you do in a way that will make a permanent\r\nimpression. Show the Irishman that a vice not indigenous to his\r\nnation--for the rich and noble who are not so tempted are chivalrous\r\nto an uncommon degree in their openness, bold sincerity, and adherence\r\nto their word--has crept over and become deeply rooted in the poorer\r\npeople from the long oppressions they have undergone. Show them what\r\nefforts and care will be needed to wash out the taint. Offer your aid,\r\nas a faithful friend, to watch their lapses, and refine their sense of\r\ntruth. You will not speak in vain. If they never mend, if habit is too\r\npowerful, still, their nobler nature will not have been addressed in\r\nvain. They will not forget the counsels they have not strength to\r\nfollow, and the benefits will be seen in their children or children's\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nMany say, \"Well, suppose we do all this; what then? They are so fond\r\nof change, they will leave us.\" What then? Why, let them go and carry\r\nthe good seed elsewhere. Will you be as selfish and short-sighted as\r\nthose who never plant trees to shade a hired house, lest some one else\r\nshould be blest by their shade?\r\n\r\nIt is a simple duty we ask you to engage in; it is, also, a great\r\npatriotic work. You are asked to engage in the great work of mutual\r\neducation, which must be for this country the system of mutual\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\nWe have some hints upon this subject, drawn from the experience of the\r\nwise and good, some encouragement to offer from that experience, that\r\nthe fruits of a wise planting sometimes ripen sooner than we could\r\ndare to expect. But this must be for another day.\r\n\r\nOne word as to this love of change. We hear people blaming it in their\r\nservants, who can and do go to Niagara, to the South, to the Springs,\r\nto Europe, to the seaside; in short, who are always on the move\r\nwhenever they feel the need of variety to reanimate mind, health, or\r\nspirits. Change of place, as to family employment, is the only way\r\ndomestics have of \"seeing life\"--the only way immigrants have of\r\ngetting thoroughly acquainted with the new society into which they\r\nhave entered. How natural that they should incline to it! Once more;\r\nput yourself in their places, and then judge them gently from your\r\nown, if you would be just to them, if you would be of any use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATE MEN AND WOMEN AS SOULS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHad Christendom but been true to its standard, while accommodating its\r\nmodes of operation to the calls of successive times, Woman would now\r\nhave not only equal _power_ with Man,--for of that omnipotent\r\nnature will never suffer her to be defrauded,--but a _chartered_\r\npower, too fully recognized to be abused. Indeed, all that is wanting\r\nis, that Man should prove his own freedom by making her free. Let him\r\nabandon conventional restriction, as a vestige of that Oriental\r\nbarbarity which confined Woman to a seraglio. Let him trust her\r\nentirely, and give her every privilege already acquired for\r\nhimself,--elective franchise, tenure of property, liberty to speak in\r\npublic assemblies, &c.\r\n\r\nNature has pointed out her ordinary sphere by the circumstances of her\r\nphysical existence. She cannot wander far. If here and there the gods\r\nsend their missives through women as through men, let them speak\r\nwithout remonstrance. In no age have men been able wholly to hinder\r\nthem. A Deborah must always be a spiritual mother in Israel. A Corinna\r\nmay be excluded from the Olympic games, yet all men will hear her\r\nsong, and a Pindar sit at her feet. It is Man's fault that there ever\r\nwere Aspasias and Ninons. These exquisite forms were intended for the\r\nshrines of virtue.\r\n\r\nNeither need men fear to lose their domestic deities. Woman is born\r\nfor love, and it is impossible to turn her from seeking it. Men should\r\ndeserve her love as an inheritance, rather than seize and guard it\r\nlike a prey. Were they noble, they would strive rather not to be loved\r\ntoo much, and to turn her from idolatry to the true, the only Love.\r\nThen, children of one Father, they could not err nor misconceive one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nSociety is now so complex, that it is no longer possible to educate\r\nWoman merely as Woman; the tasks which come to her hand are so\r\nvarious, and so large a proportion of women are thrown entirely upon\r\ntheir own resources. I admit that this is not their state of perfect\r\ndevelopment; but it seems as if Heaven, having so long issued its\r\nedict in poetry and religion without securing intelligent obedience,\r\nnow commanded the world in prose to take a high and rational view. The\r\nlesson reads to me thus:--\r\n\r\nSex, like rank, wealth, beauty, or talent, is but an accident of\r\nbirth. As you would not educate a soul to be an aristocrat, so do not\r\nto be a woman. A general regard to her usual sphere is dictated in the\r\neconomy of nature. You need never enforce these provisions rigorously.\r\nAchilles had long plied the distaff as a princess; yet, at first sight\r\nof a sword, he seized it. So with Woman; one hour of love would teach\r\nher more of her proper relations than all your formulas and\r\nconventions. Express your views, men, of what you _seek_ in\r\nwomen; thus best do you give them laws. Learn, women, what you should\r\n_demand_ of men; thus only can they become themselves. Turn both\r\nfrom the contemplation of what is merely phenomenal in your existence,\r\nto your permanent life as souls. Man, do not prescribe how the Divine\r\nshall display itself in Woman. Woman, do not expect to see all of God\r\nin Man. Fellow-pilgrims and helpmeets are ye, Apollo and Diana, twins\r\nof one heavenly birth, both beneficent, and both armed. Man, fear not\r\nto yield to Woman's hand both the quiver and the lyre; for if her urn\r\nbe filled with light, she will use both to the glory of God. There is\r\nbut one doctrine for ye both, and that is the doctrine of the SOUL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTS FROM JOURNALS AND LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following extract from Margaret's Journal will be read with a\r\ndegree of melancholy interest when connected with the eventful end of\r\nher eventful life. It was written many years before her journey to\r\nEurope, and rings in our ears now almost with the tones of\r\nprophecy.--Ed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI like to listen to the soliloquies of a bright child. In this\r\nmicrocosm the philosophical observer may trace the natural progression\r\nof the mind of mankind. I often silently observe L---, with this view.\r\nHe is generally imitative and dramatic; the day-school, the singing-school\r\nor the evening party, are acted out with admirable variety in the humors\r\nof the scene, end great discrimination of character in its broader\r\nfeatures. What is chiefly remarkable is his unconsciousness of his\r\nmental processes, and how thoughts it would be impossible for him\r\nto recall spring up in his mind like flowers and weeds in the soil.\r\nBut to-night he was truly in a state of lyrical inspiration, his eyes\r\nflashing, his face glowing, and his whole composition chanted out in\r\nan almost metrical form. He began by mourning the death of a certain\r\nHarriet whom he had let go to foreign parts, and who had died at sea.\r\nHe described her as having \"blue, sparkling eyes, and a sweet smile,\"\r\nand lamented that he could never kiss her cold lips again. This part,\r\nwhich he continued for some time, was in prolonged cadences, and a\r\nlow, mournful tone, with a frequently recurring burden of \"O, my\r\nHarriet, shall I never see thee more!\"\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEXTRACT FROM JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is so true that a woman may be in love with a woman, and a man with\r\na man. It is pleasant to be sure of it, because it is undoubtedly the\r\nsame love that we shall feel when we are angels, when we ascend to the\r\nonly fit place for the Mignons, where\r\n\r\n  \"Sie fragen nicht nach Mann und Welb.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is regulated by the same law as that of love between persons of\r\ndifferent sexes, only it is purely intellectual and spiritual,\r\nunprefaced by any mixture of lower instincts, undisturbed by any need\r\nof consulting temporal interests; its law is the desire of the spirit\r\nto realize a whole, which makes it seek in another being that which it\r\nfinds not in itself.\r\n\r\nThus the beautiful seek the strong; the mute seek the eloquent; the\r\nbutterfly settles on the dark flower. Why did Socrates so love\r\nAlcibiades? Why did Korner so love Schneider? How natural is the love\r\nof Wallenstein for Max, that of Madame de Stael for de Recamier, mine\r\nfor -----! I loved ---- for a time with as much passion as I was then\r\nstrong enough to feel. Her face was always gleaming before me; her\r\nvoice was echoing in my ear; all poetic thoughts clustered round the\r\ndear image. This love was for me a key which unlocked many a treasure\r\nwhich I still possess; it was the carbuncle (emblematic gem!) which\r\ncast light into many of the darkest corners of human nature. She loved\r\nme, too, though not so much, because her nature was \"less high, less\r\ngrave, less large, less deep;\" but she loved more tenderly, less\r\npassionately. She loved me, for I well remember her suffering when she\r\nfirst could feel my faults, and knew one part of the exquisite veil\r\nrent away--how she wished to stay apart and weep the whole day.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were suggested by a large engraving representing Madame\r\nRecamier in her boudoir. I have so often thought over the intimacy\r\nbetween her and Madame de Stael.\r\n\r\nMadame Recamier is half-reclining on a sofa; she is clad in white\r\ndrapery, which clings very gracefully to her round, but\r\nelegantly-slender form; her beautiful neck and arms are bare; her hair\r\nknotted up so as to show the contour of her truly-feminine head to\r\ngreat advantage. A book lies carelessly on her lap; one hand yet holds\r\nit at the place where she left off reading; her lovely face is turned\r\ntowards us; she appears to muse on what she has been reading. When we\r\nsee a woman in a picture with a book, she seems to be doing precisely\r\nthat for which she was born; the book gives such an expression of\r\npurity to the female figure. A large window, partially veiled by a\r\nwhite curtain, gives a view of a city at some little distance. On one\r\nside stand the harp and piano; there are just books enough for a\r\nlady's boudoir. There is no picture, except one of De Recamier\r\nherself, as Corinne. This is absurd; but the absurdity is interesting,\r\nas recalling the connection. You imagine her to have been reading one\r\nof De Stael's books, and to be now pondering what those brilliant\r\nwords of her gifted friend can mean.\r\n\r\nEverything in the room is in keeping. Nothing appears to have been put\r\nthere because other people have it; but there is nothing which shows a\r\ntaste more noble and refined than you would expect from the fair\r\nFrenchwoman. All is elegant, modern, in harmony with the delicate\r\nhabits and superficial culture which you would look for in its\r\noccupant.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER MOTHER.\r\n\r\n_Sept_. 5, 1837.\r\n\r\n* * * * * If I stay in Providence, and more money is wanting than can\r\notherwise be furnished, I will take a private class, which is ready for\r\nme, and by which, even if I reduced my terms to suit the place, I can\r\nearn the four hundred dollars that ---- will need. If I do not stay, I\r\nwill let her have my portion of our income, with her own, or even capital\r\nwhich I have a right to take up, and come into this or some other\r\neconomical place, and live at the cheapest rate. It will not be even a\r\nsacrifice to me to do so, for I am weary of society, and long for the\r\nopportunity for solitary concentration of thought. I know what I say;\r\nif I live, you may rely upon me.\r\n\r\nGod be with you, my dear mother! I am sure he will prosper the doings\r\nof so excellent a woman if you will only keep your mind calm and be\r\nfirm. Trust your daughter too. I feel increasing trust in mine own\r\ngood mind. We will take good care of the children and of one another.\r\nNever fear to trouble me with your perplexities. I can never be so\r\nsituated that I do not earnestly wish to know them. Besides, things do\r\nnot trouble me as they did, for I feel within myself the power to aid,\r\nto serve.\r\n\r\nMost affectionately,\r\n\r\nYour daughter, M.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPART OF LETTER TO M.\r\n\r\n_Providence_, Oct. 7, 1838.\r\n\r\n* * * For yourself, dear ------, you have attained an important age.\r\nNo plan is desirable for you which is to be pursued with precision.\r\nThe world, the events of every day, which no one can predict, are to\r\nbe your teachers, and you must, in some degree, give yourself up, and\r\nsubmit to be led captive, if you would learn from them. Principle must\r\nbe at the helm, but thought must shift its direction with the winds\r\nand waves.\r\n\r\nHappy as you are thus far in worthy friends, you are not in much\r\ndanger of rash intimacies or great errors. I think, upon the whole,\r\nquite highly of your judgment about people and conduct; for, though\r\nyour first feelings are often extravagant, they are soon balanced.\r\n\r\nI do not know other faults in you beside that want of retirement of\r\nmind which I have before spoken of. If M------ and A------ want too\r\nmuch seclusion, and are too severe in their views of life and man, I\r\nthink you are too little so. There is nothing so fatal to the finer\r\nfaculties as too ready or too extended a publicity. There is some\r\ndanger lest there be no real religion in the heart which craves too\r\nmuch of daily sympathy. Through your mind the stream of life has\r\ncoursed with such rapidity that it has often swept away the seed or\r\nloosened the roots of the young plants before they had ripened any\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nI should think writing would be very good for you. A journal of your\r\nlife, and analyses of your thoughts, would teach you how to\r\ngeneralize, and give firmness to your conclusions. Do not write down\r\nmerely that things are beautiful, or the reverse; but _what_ they\r\nare, and _why_ they are beautiful or otherwise; and show these\r\npapers, at least at present, to nobody. Be your own judge and your own\r\nhelper. Do not go too soon to any one with your difficulties, but try\r\nto clear them up for yourself.\r\n\r\nI think the course of reading you have fallen upon, of late, will be\r\nbetter for you than such books as you formerly read, addressed rather\r\nto the taste and imagination than the judgment. The love of beauty has\r\nrather an undue development in your mind. See now what it is, and what\r\nit has been. Leave for a time the Ideal, and return to the Real.\r\n\r\nI should think two or three hours a day would be quite enough, at\r\npresent, for you to give to books. Now learn buying and selling,\r\nkeeping the house, directing the servants; all that will bring you\r\nworlds of wisdom if you keep it subordinate to the one grand aim of\r\nperfecting the whole being. And let your self-respect forbid you to do\r\nimperfectly anything that you do at all.\r\n\r\nI always feel ashamed when I write with this air of wisdom; but you\r\nwill see, by my hints, what I mean. Your mind wants depth and\r\nprecision; your character condensation. Keep your high aim steadily in\r\nview; life will open the path to reach it. I think ----, even if she\r\nbe in excess, is an excellent friend for you; her character seems to\r\nhave what yours wants, whether she has or has not found the right way.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER BROTHER, A. B. F.\r\n\r\n_Providence, Feb_. 19, 1838\r\n\r\nMY DEAR A.:\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\nI wish you could see the journals of two dear little girls, eleven\r\nyears old, in my school. They love one another like Bessie Bell and\r\nMary Gray in the ballad. They are just of a size, both lively as\r\nbirds, affectionate, gentle, ambitious in good works and knowledge.\r\nThey encourage one another constantly to do right; they are rivals,\r\nbut never jealous of one another. One has the quicker intellect, the\r\nother is the prettier. I have never had occasion to find fault with\r\neither, and the forwardness of their minds has induced me to take both\r\ninto my reading-class, where they are associated with girls many years\r\ntheir elders. Particular pains do they take with their journals. These\r\nare written daily, in a beautiful, fair, round hand, well-composed,\r\nshowing attention, and memory well-trained, with many pleasing sallies\r\nof playfulness, and some very interesting thoughts.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Jamaica Plain, Dec_. 20, 1840.\r\n\r\n* * * * About your school I do not think I could give you much advice\r\nwhich would be of value, unless I could know your position more in\r\ndetail. The most important rule is, in all relations with our\r\nfellow-creatures, never forget that, if they are imperfect persons,\r\nthey are immortal souls, and treat them as you would wish to be\r\ntreated by the light of that thought.\r\n\r\nAs to the application of means, abstain from punishment as much as\r\npossible, and use encouragement as far as you can _without\r\nflattery_. But be even more careful as to strict truth in this\r\nregard, towards children, than to persons of your own age; for, to the\r\nchild, the parent or teacher is the representative of _justice;_\r\nand as that of life is severe, an education which, in any degree,\r\nexcites vanity, is the very worst preparation for that general and\r\ncrowded school.\r\n\r\nI doubt not you will teach grammar well, as I saw you aimed at\r\nprinciples in your practice.\r\n\r\nIn geography, try to make pictures of the scenes, that they may be\r\npresent to their imaginations, and the nobler faculties be brought\r\ninto action, as well as memory.\r\n\r\nIn history, try to study and paint the characters of _great men_;\r\nthey best interpret the leadings of events amid the nations.\r\n\r\nI am pleased with your way of speaking of both people and pupils; your\r\nview seems from the right point. Yet beware of over great pleasure in\r\nbeing popular, or even beloved. As far as an amiable disposition and\r\npowers of entertainment make you so, it is a happiness; but if there\r\nis one grain of plausibility, it is poison.\r\n\r\nBut I will not play Mentor too much, lest I make you averse to write\r\nto your very affectionate sister,\r\n\r\nM.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER BROTHER, R.\r\n\r\nI entirely agree in what you say of _tuition_ and\r\n_intuition;_ the two must act and react upon one another, to make\r\na man, to form a mind. Drudgery is as necessary, to call out the\r\ntreasures of the mind, as harrowing and planting those of the earth.\r\nAnd besides, the growths of literature and art are as much nature as\r\nthe trees in Concord woods; but nature idealized and perfected.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n1841.\r\n\r\nI take great pleasure in that feeling of the living presence of beauty\r\nin nature which your letters show. But you, who have now lived long\r\nenough to see some of my prophecies fulfilled, will not deny, though\r\nyou may not yet believe the truth of my words when I say you go to an\r\nextreme in your denunciations of cities and the social institutions.\r\n_These_ are a growth also, and, as well as the diseases which\r\ncome upon them, under the control of the one spirit as much as the\r\ngreat tree on which the insects prey, and in whose bark the busy bird\r\nhas made many a wound.\r\n\r\nWhen we get the proper perspective of these things we shall find man,\r\nhowever artificial, still a part of nature. Meanwhile, let us trust;\r\nand while it is the soul's duty ever to bear witness to the best it\r\nknows, let us not be hasty to conclude that in what suits us not there\r\ncan be no good. Let us be sure there _must_ be eventual good,\r\ncould we but see far enough to discern it. In maintaining perfect\r\ntruth to ourselves and choosing that mode of being which suits us, we\r\nhad best leave others alone as much as may be. You prefer the country,\r\nand I doubt not it is on the whole a better condition of life to live\r\nthere; but at the country party you have mentioned you saw that no\r\ncircumstances will keep people from being frivolous. One may be\r\ngossipping, and vulgar, and idle in the country,--earnest, noble and\r\nwise, in the city. Nature cannot be kept from us while there is a sky\r\nabove, with so much as one star to remind us of prayer in the silent\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAs I walked home this evening at sunset, over the Mill-Dam, towards\r\nthe city, I saw very distinctly that the city also is a bed in God's\r\ngarden. More of this some other time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO A YOUNG FRIEND.\r\n\r\n_Concord, May _2, 1837.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR: I am passing happy here, except that I am not well,--so\r\nunwell that I fear I must go home and ask my good mother to let me\r\nrest and vegetate beneath her sunny kindness for a while. The\r\nexcitement of conversation prevents my sleeping. The drive here with\r\nMr. E------ was delightful. Dear Nature and Time, so often\r\ncalumniated, will take excellent care of us if we will let them. The\r\nwisdom lies in schooling the heart not to expect too much. I did that\r\ngood thing when I came here, and I am rich. On Sunday I drove to\r\nWatertown with the author of \"Nature.\" The trees were still bare, but\r\nthe little birds care not for that; they revel, and carol, and wildly\r\ntell their hopes, while the gentle, \"voluble\" south wind plays with\r\nthe dry leaves, and the pine-trees sigh with their soul-like sounds\r\nfor June. It was beauteous; and care and routine fled away, and I was\r\nas if they had never been, except that I vaguely whispered to myself\r\nthat all had been well with me.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe baby here is beautiful. He looks like his father, and smiles so\r\nsweetly on all hearty, good people. I play with him a good deal, and\r\nhe comes so _natural,_ after Dante and other poets.\r\n\r\nEver faithfully your friend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n1837.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED CHILD: I was very glad to get your note. Do not think you\r\nmust only write to your friends when you can tell them you are happy;\r\nthey will not misunderstand you in the dark hour, nor think you\r\n_forsaken_, if cast down. Though your letter of Wednesday was\r\nvery sweet to me, yet I knew it could not last as it was then. These\r\nhours of heavenly, heroic strength leave us, but they come again:\r\ntheir memory is with us amid after-trials, and gives us a foretaste of\r\nthat era when the steadfast soul shall be the only reality.\r\n\r\nMy dearest, you must suffer, but you will always be growing stronger,\r\nand with every trial nobly met, you will feel a growing assurance that\r\nnobleness is not a mere _sentiment_ with you. I sympathize deeply\r\nin your anxiety about your mother; yet I cannot but remember the\r\nbootless fear and agitation about my mother, and how strangely our\r\ndestinies were guided. Take refuge in prayer when you are most\r\ntroubled; the door of the sanctuary will never be shut against you. I\r\nsend you a paper which is very sacred to me. Bless Heaven that your\r\nheart is awakened to sacred duties before any kind of gentle\r\nministering has become impossible, before any relation has been\r\nbroken.  [Footnote: It has always been my desire to find appropriate\r\ntime and place to correct an erroneous impression which has gained\r\ncurrency in regard to my father, and which does injustice to his\r\nmemory. That impression is that he was exceedingly stern and exacting\r\nin the parental relation, and especially in regard to my sister; that\r\nhe forbid or frowned upon her sports;--excluded her from intercourse\r\nwith other children when she, a child, needed such companionship, and\r\nrequired her to bend almost unceasingly over her books. This\r\nimpression has, certainly in part, arisen from an autobiographical\r\nsketch, never written for publication nor intended for a literal or\r\ncomplete statement of her father's educational method, or the relation\r\nwhich existed between them, which was most loving and true on both\r\nsides. While the narrative is true, it is not the all she would have\r\nsaid, and, therefore, taken alone, conveys an impression which\r\nmisleads those who did not know our father well. Perhaps no better\r\nopportunity or place than this may ever arise to correct this\r\nimpression so for us it is wrong. It is true that my father had a very\r\nhigh standard of scholarship, and did expect conformity to it in his\r\nchildren. He was not stern toward them.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtless true, also, that he did not perfectly comprehend the\r\nrare mind of his daughter, or see for some years that she required no\r\nstimulating to intellectual effort, as do most children, but rather\r\nthe reverse. But how many fathers are there who would have understood\r\nat once such a child as Margaret Fuller was, or would have done even\r\nas wisely as he? And how long is it since a wiser era has dawned upon\r\nthe world (its light not yet fully welcomed), in which attention first\r\nto physical development to the exclusion of the mental, is an axiom in\r\neducation! Was it so deemed forty years ago? Nor has it been\r\nconsidered that so gifted a child would naturally, as she did,\r\n_seek_ the companionship of those older than herself, and not of\r\nchildren who had little in unison with her. She needed, doubtless, to\r\nbe _urged_ into the usual sports of children, and the company of\r\nthose of her own age; if _not_ urged to enter these she was never\r\nexcluded from either. She needed to be kept from books for a period,\r\nor to be led to those of a lighter cost than such as she read, and\r\nwhich usually task the thoughts of mature men. This simply was not\r\ndone, and the error arose from no lack of tenderness, or\r\nconsideration, from no lack of the wisdom of those times, but from the\r\nsimple fact that the laws of physiology as connected with those of\r\nmind were not understood then as now, nor was attention so much\r\ndirected to physical culture as of the primary importance it is now\r\nregarded. Our father was indeed exact and strict with himself and\r\nothers; but none has ever been more devoted to his children than he,\r\nor more painstaking with their education, nor more fondly loved them;\r\nand in later life they have ever been more and more impressed with the\r\nconviction of his fidelity and wisdom. That Margaret venerated her\r\nfather, and that his love was returned, is abundantly evidenced in her\r\npoem which accompanies this letter. This, too, was not written for the\r\npublic eye, but it is too noble a tribute, too honorable both to\r\nfather and daughter, to be suppressed. I trust that none, passing from\r\none extreme to the other, will infer from the natural self-reproach\r\nand upbraiding because of short-comings, felt by every true mind when\r\nan honored and loved parent departs, that she lacked fidelity in the\r\nrelation of daughter. She agreed not always with his views and\r\nmethods, but this diversity of mind never affected their mutual\r\nrespect and love.--[Ed.]]\r\n\r\n\r\nLINES WRITTEN IN MARCH, 1836.\r\n\r\n  \"I will not leave you comfortless.\"\r\n\r\n  O, Friend divine! this promise dear\r\n  Falls sweetly on the weary ear!\r\n  Often, in hours of sickening pain,\r\n  It soothes me to thy rest again.\r\n\r\n  Might I a true disciple be,\r\n  Following thy footsteps faithfully,\r\n  Then should I still the succor prove\r\n  Of him who gave his life for love.\r\n\r\n  When this fond heart would vainly beat\r\n  For bliss that ne'er on earth we meet,\r\n  For perfect sympathy of soul,\r\n  From those such heavy laws control;\r\n\r\n  When, roused from passion's ecstasy,\r\n  I see the dreams that filled it fly,\r\n  Amid my bitter tears and sighs\r\n  Those gentle words before me rise.\r\n\r\n  With aching brows and feverish brain\r\n  The founts of intellect I drain,\r\n  And con with over-anxious thought\r\n  What poets sung and heroes wrought.\r\n\r\n  Enchanted with their deeds and lays,\r\n  I with like gems would deck my days;\r\n  No fires creative in me burn,\r\n  And, humbled, I to Thee return;\r\n\r\n  When blackest clouds around me rolled\r\n  Of scepticism drear and cold,\r\n  When love, and hope, and joy and pride,\r\n  Forsook a spirit deeply tried;\r\n\r\n  My reason wavered in that hour,\r\n  Prayer, too impatient, lost its power;\r\n  From thy benignity a ray,\r\n  I caught, and found the perfect day.\r\n\r\n  A head revered in dust was laid;\r\n  For the first time I watched my dead;\r\n  The widow's sobs were checked in vain,\r\n  And childhood's tears poured down like rain.\r\n\r\n  In awe I gaze on that dear face,\r\n  In sorrow, years gone by retrace,\r\n  When, nearest duties most forgot,\r\n  I might have blessed, and did it not!\r\n\r\n  Ignorant, his wisdom I reproved,\r\n  Heedless, passed by what most he loved,\r\n  Knew not a life like his to prize,\r\n  Of ceaseless toil and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n  No tears can now that hushed heart move,\r\n  No cares display a daughter's love,\r\n  The fair occasion lost, no more\r\n  Can thoughts more just to thee restore.\r\n\r\n  What can I do?

To me this brings unusual\r\nsorrow, though I have never yet seen him; but I thought of him as one\r\nof the very few persons known to me by reputation, whose acquaintance\r\nmight enrich me. His character was a sufficient answer to the doubt,\r\nwhether a merchant can be a man of honor. He was, like your father,\r\na man all whose virtues had stood the test. He was no word-hero.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO A YOUNG FRIEND.\r\n\r\n_Providence, June 16,1837_.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ------: I pray you, amid all your duties, to keep some hours\r\nto yourself. Do not let my example lead you into excessive exertions.\r\nI pay dear for extravagance of this sort; five years ago I had no idea\r\nof the languor and want of animal spirits which torment me now. Animal\r\nspirits are not to be despised. An earnest mind and seeking heart will\r\nnot often be troubled by despondency; but unless the blood can dance\r\nat proper times, the lighter passages of life lose all their\r\nrefreshment and suggestion.\r\n\r\nI wish you and ------- had been here last Saturday. Our school-house\r\nwas dedicated, and Mr. Emerson made the address; it was a noble appeal\r\nin behalf of the best interests of culture, and seemingly here was fit\r\noccasion. The building was beautiful, and furnished with an even\r\nelegant propriety.\r\n\r\nI am at perfect liberty to do what I please, and there are apparently\r\nthe best dispositions, if not the best preparation, on the part of the\r\nhundred and fifty young minds with whom I am to be brought in contact.\r\n\r\nI sigh for the country; trees, birds and flowers, assure me that June\r\nis here, but I must walk through streets many and long, to get sight\r\nof any expanse of green. I had no fine weather while at home, though\r\nthe quiet and rest were delightful to me; the sun did not shine once\r\nreally warmly, nor did the apple-trees put on their blossoms until the\r\nvery day I came away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSONNET.\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n  Although the sweet, still watches of the night\r\n  Find me all lonely now, yet the delight\r\n  Hath not quite gone, which from thy presence flows.\r\n  The love, the joy that in thy bosom glows,\r\n  Lingers to cheer thy friend. From thy fresh dawn\r\n  Some golden exhalations have I drawn\r\n  To make less dim my dusty noon. Thy tones\r\n  Are with me still; some plaintive as the moans\r\n  Of Dryads, when their native groves must fall,\r\n  Some wildly wailing, like the clarion-call\r\n  On battle-field, strewn with the noble dead.\r\n  Some in soft romance, like the echoes bred\r\n  In the most secret groves of Arcady;\r\n  Yet all, wild, sad, or soft, how steeped in poesy!\r\n\r\n_Providence, April_, 1838.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Providence, Oct_. 21, 1838.\r\n\r\n* * * * I am reminded by what you say, of an era in my own existence;\r\nit is seven years bygone. For bitter months a heavy weight had been\r\npressing on me,--the weight of deceived friendship. I could not be\r\nmuch alone,--a great burden of family cares pressed upon me; I was in\r\nthe midst of society, and obliged to act my part there as well as I\r\ncould. At that time I took up the study of German, and my progress was\r\nlike the rebound of a string pressed almost to bursting. My mind being\r\nthen in the highest state of action, heightened, by intellectual\r\nappreciation, every pang; and imagination, by prophetic power, gave to\r\nthe painful present all the weight of as painful a future.\r\n\r\nAt this time I never had any consolation, except in long solitary\r\nwalks, and my meditations then were so far aloof from common life,\r\nthat on my return my fall was like that of the eagle, which the\r\nsportsman's hand calls bleeding from his lofty flight, to stain the\r\nearth with his blood.\r\n\r\nIn such hours we feel so noble, so full of love and bounty, that we\r\ncannot conceive how any pain should have been needed to teach us. It\r\nthen seems we are so born for good, that such means of leading us to\r\nit were wholly unnecessary. But I have lived to know that the secret\r\nof all things is pain, and that nature travaileth most painfully with\r\nher noblest product. I was not without hours of deep spiritual\r\ninsight, and consciousness of the inheritance of vast powers. I\r\ntouched the secret of the universe, and by that touch was invested\r\nwith talismanic power which has never left me, though it sometimes\r\nlies dormant for a long time.\r\n\r\nOne day lives always in my memory; one chastest, heavenliest day of\r\ncommunion with the soul of things. It was Thanksgiving-day. I was free\r\nto be alone; in the meditative woods, by the choked-up fountain, I\r\npassed its hours, each of which contained ages of thought and emotion.\r\nI saw, then, how idle were my griefs; that I had acquired _the\r\nthought_ of each object which had been taken from me; that more\r\nextended personal relations would only have given me pleasures which\r\nthen seemed not worth my care, and which would surely have dimmed my\r\nsense of the spiritual meaning of all which had passed. I felt how\r\ntrue it was that nothing in any being which was fit for me, could long\r\nbe kept from me; and that, if separation could be, real intimacy had\r\nnever been. All the films seemed to drop from my existence, and I was\r\nsure that I should never starve in this desert world, but that manna\r\nwould drop from Heaven, if I would but rise with every rising sun to\r\ngather it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I went to the church-yard; the moon sailed above the\r\nrosy clouds,--the crescent moon rose above the heavenward-pointing\r\nspire. At that hour a vision came upon my soul, whose final scene last\r\nmonth interpreted. The rosy clouds of illusion are all vanished; the\r\nmoon has waxed to full. May my life be a church, full of devout\r\nthoughts end solemn music. I pray thus, my dearest child! \"Our Father!\r\nlet not the heaviest shower be spared; let not the gardener forbear\r\nhis knife till the fair, hopeful tree of existence be brought to its\r\nfullest blossom and fruit!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Jamaica Plain, June_, 1839.\r\n\r\n* * * I have had a pleasant visit at Nahant, but was no sooner there than\r\nthe air braced me so violently as to drive all the blood to my head. I\r\nhad headache two of the three days we were there, and yet I enjoyed my\r\nstay very much. We had the rocks and piazzas to ourselves, and were on\r\nsufficiently good terms not to destroy, if we could not enhance, one\r\nanother's pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe first night we had a storm, and the wind roared and wailed round\r\nthe house that Ossianic poetry of which you hear so many strains. Next\r\nday was clear and brilliant, with a high north-west wind. I went out\r\nabout six o'clock, and had a two hours' scramble before breakfast. I\r\ndo not like to sit still in this air, which exasperates all my nervous\r\nfeelings; but when I can exhaust myself in climbing, I feel\r\ndelightfully,--the eye is so sharpened, and the mind so full of\r\nthought. The outlines of all objects, the rocks, the distant sails,\r\neven the rippling of the ocean, were so sharp that they seemed to\r\npress themselves into the brain. When I see a natural scene by such a\r\nlight it stays in my memory always as a picture; on milder days it\r\ninfluences me more in the way of reverie. After breakfast, we walked\r\non the beaches. It was quite low tide, no waves, and the fine sand\r\neddying wildly about. I came home with that frenzied headache which\r\nyou are so unlucky as to know, covered my head with wet towels, and\r\nwent to bed. After dinner I was better, and we went to the\r\nSpouting-horn. C---- was perched close to the fissure, far above me,\r\nand, in a pale green dress, she looked like the nymph of the place. I\r\nlay down on a rock, low in the water, where I could hear the twin\r\nharmonies of the sucking of the water into the spout, and the washing\r\nof the surge on the foot of the rock. I never passed a more delightful\r\nafternoon. Clouds of pearl and amber were slowly drifting across the\r\nsky, or resting a while to dream, like me, near the water. Opposite\r\nme, at considerable distance, was a line of rock, along which the\r\nbillows of the advancing tide chased one another, and leaped up\r\nexultingly as they were about to break. That night we had a sunset of\r\nthe gorgeous, autumnal kind, and in the evening very brilliant\r\nmoonlight; but the air was so cold I could enjoy it but a few minutes.\r\nNext day, which was warm and soft, I was out on the rocks all day. In\r\nthe afternoon I was out alone, and had an admirable place, a cleft\r\nbetween two vast towers of rock with turret-shaped tops. I got on a\r\nledge of rock at their foot, where I could lie and let the waves wash\r\nup around me, and look up at the proud turrets rising into the\r\nprismatic light. This evening was very fine; all the sky covered with\r\ncrowding clouds, profound, but not sullen of mood, the moon wading,\r\nthe stars peeping, the wind sighing very softly. We lay on the high\r\nrocks and listened to the plashing of the waves. The next day was\r\ngood, but the keen light was too much for my eyes and brain; and,\r\nthough I am glad to have been there, I am as glad to get back to our\r\ngarlanded rocks, and richly-green fields and groves. I wish you could\r\ncome to me now; we have such wealth of roses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Jamaica Plain, Aug., 1839_.\r\n\r\n* * * * I returned home well, full of earnestness; yet, I know not why,\r\nwith the sullen, boding sky came a mood of sadness, nay, of gloom, black\r\nas Hades, which I have vainly striven to fend off by work, by exercise,\r\nby high memories. Very glad was I of a painful piece of intelligence,\r\nwhich came the same day with your letter, to bring me on excuse for\r\ntears. That was a black Friday, both above and within. What demon\r\nresists our good angel, and seems at such times to have the mastery?\r\nOnly _seems_, I say to myself; it is but the sickness of the\r\nimmortal soul, and shall by-and-by be cast aside like a film. I think\r\nthis is the great step of our life,--to change the _nature_ of\r\nour self-reliance. We find that the will cannot conquer circumstances,\r\nand that our temporal nature must vary its hue here with the food that\r\nis given it. Only out of mulberry leaves will the silk-worm spin its\r\nthread fine and durable. The mode of our existence is not in our own\r\npower; but behind it is the immutable essence that cannot be\r\ntarnished; and to hold fast to this conviction, to live as far as\r\npossible by its light, cannot be denied us if we elect this kind of\r\nself-trust. Yet is sickness wearisome; and I rejoice to say that my\r\ndemon seems to have been frightened away by this day's sun. But,\r\nconscious of these diseases of the mind, believe that I can sympathize\r\nwith a friend when subject to the same. Do not fail to go and stay\r\nwith ---------; few live so penetrating and yet so kind, so true, so\r\nsensitive. She is the spirit of love as well as of intellect. * * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\nMY BELOVED CHILD: I confess I was much disappointed when I first\r\nreceived your letter this evening. I have been quite ill for two or\r\nthree days, and looked forward to your presence as a restorative. But\r\nthink not I would have had you act differently; far better is it for\r\nme to have my child faithful to duty than even to have her with me.\r\nSuch was the lesson I taught her in a better hour. I am abashed to\r\nthink how often lately I have found excuses for indolence in the\r\nweakness of my body; while now, after solitary communion with my\r\nbetter nature, I feel it was weakness of mind, weak fear of depression\r\nand conflict. But the Father of our spirits will not long permit a\r\nheart fit for worship\r\n\r\n                \"--------- to seek\r\n  From weak recoils, exemptions weak,\r\n  After false gods to go astray,\r\n  Deck altars vile with garlands gay,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHis voice has reached me; and I trust the postponement of your visit\r\nwill give me space to nerve myself to what strength I should, so that,\r\nwhen we do meet, I shall rejoice that you did not come to help or\r\nsoothe me; for I shall have helped and soothed myself. Indeed, I would\r\nnot so willingly that you should see my short-comings as know that\r\nthey exist. Pray that I may never lose sight of my vocation; that I\r\nmay not make ill-health a plea for sloth and cowardice; pray that,\r\nwhenever I do, I may be punished more swiftly than this time, by a\r\nsadness as deep as now.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER BROTHER, R.\r\n\r\n_Cambridge, August_ 6, 1842.\r\n\r\nMy dear R.: I want to hear how you enjoyed your journey, and what you\r\nthink of the world as surveyed from mountain-tops. I enjoy exceedingly\r\nstaying among the mountains. I am satisfied with reading these bolder\r\nlines in the manuscript of Nature. Merely gentle and winning scenes\r\nare not enough for me. I wish my lot had been cast amid the sources of\r\nthe streams, where the voice of the hidden torrent is heard by night,\r\nwhere the eagle soars, and the thunder resounds in long peals from\r\nside to side; where the grasp of a more powerful emotion has rent\r\nasunder the rocks, and the long purple shadows fall like a broad wing\r\nupon the valley. All places, like all persons, I know, have beauty;\r\nbut only in some scenes, and with some people, can I expand and feel\r\nmyself at home. I feel all this the more for having passed my earlier\r\nlife in such a place as Cambridgeport. There I had nothing except the\r\nlittle flower-garden behind the house, and the elms before the door. I\r\nused to long and sigh for beautiful places such as I read of. There\r\nwas not one walk for me, except over the bridge. I liked that very\r\nmuch,--the river, and the city glittering in sunset, and the lively\r\nundulating line all round, and the light smokes, seen in some weather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER TO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Milwaukie, July _29, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR R.:  * * * Daily I thought of you during my visit to the\r\nRock-river territory. It is only five years since the poor Indians\r\nhave been dispossessed of this region of sumptuous loveliness, such as\r\ncan hardly be paralleled in the world. No wonder they poured out their\r\nblood freely before they would go. On one island, belonging to a Mr.\r\nH., with whom we stayed, are still to be found their \"caches\" for\r\nsecreting provisions,--the wooden troughs in which they pounded their\r\ncorn, the marks of their tomahawks upon felled trees. When he first\r\ncame, he found the body of an Indian woman, in a canoe, elevated on\r\nhigh poles, with all her ornaments on. This island is a spot, where\r\nNature seems to have exhausted her invention in crowding it with all\r\nkinds of growths, from the richest trees down to the most delicate\r\nplants. It divides the river which there sweeps along in clear and\r\nglittering current, between noble parks, richest green lawns, pictured\r\nrocks crowned with old hemlocks, or smooth bluffs, three hundred feet\r\nhigh, the most beautiful of all. Two of these,--the Eagle's Nest, and\r\nthe Deer's Walk, still the resort of the grand and beautiful creature\r\nfrom which they are named,--were the scene of some of the happiest\r\nhours of my life. I had no idea, from verbal description, of the\r\nbeauty of these bluffs, nor can I hope to give any to others. They lie\r\nso magnificently bathed in sunlight, they touch the heavens with so\r\nsharp and fair a line. This is one of the finest parts of the river;\r\nbut it seems beautiful enough to fill any heart and eye all along its\r\ncourse, nowhere broken or injured by the hand of man. And there, I\r\nthought, if we two could live, and you could have a farm which would\r\nnot cost a twentieth part the labor of a New England farm, and would\r\npay twenty times as much for the labor, and have our books and, our\r\npens and a little boat on the river, how happy we might be for four or\r\nfive years,--at least, _as_ happy as Fate permits mortals to be.\r\nFor we, I think, are congenial, and if I could hope permanent peace on\r\nthe earth, I might hope it with you.\r\n\r\nYou will be glad to hear that I feel overpaid for coming here. Much is\r\nmy life enriched by the images of the great Niagara, of the vast\r\nlakes, of the heavenly sweetness of the prairie scenes, and, above\r\nall, by the heavenly region where I would so gladly have lived. My\r\nhealth, too, is materially benefited. I hope to come back better\r\nfitted for toil and care, as well as with beauteous memories to\r\nsustain me in them.\r\n\r\nAffectionately always, &c.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MISS R.\r\n\r\n_Chicago_, _August_ 4, 1848.\r\n\r\nI HAVE hoped from time to time, dear ----, that I should receive a few\r\nlines from you, apprizing me how you are this summer, but a letter\r\nfrom Mrs. F---- lately comes to tell me that you are not better, but,\r\nat least when at Saratoga, worse.\r\n\r\nSo writing is of course fatiguing, and I must not expect letters any\r\nmore. To that I could make up my mind if I could hear that you were\r\nwell again. I fear, if your malady disturbs you as much as it did, it\r\nmust wear on your strength very much, and it seems in itself\r\ndangerous. However, it is good to think that your composure is such\r\nthat disease can only do its legitimate work, and not undermine two\r\nways,--the body with its pains, and the body through the mind with\r\nthoughts and fears of pains.\r\n\r\nI should have written to you long ago except that I find little to\r\ncommunicate this summer, and little inclination to communicate that\r\nlittle; so what letters I have sent, have been chiefly to beg some\r\nfrom my friends. I have had home-sickness sometimes here, as do\r\nchildren for the home where they are even little indulged, in the\r\nboarding-school where they are only tolerated. This has been in the\r\ntown, where I have felt the want of companionship, because the\r\ndissipation of fatigue, or expecting soon to move again, has prevented\r\nmy employing myself for myself; and yet there was nothing well worth\r\nlooking at without. When in the country I have enjoyed myself highly,\r\nand my health has improved day by day. The characters of persons are\r\nbrought out by the little wants and adventures of country life as you\r\nsee it in this region; so that each one awakens a healthy interest;\r\nand the same persons who, if I saw them at these hotels, would not\r\nhave a word to say that could fix the attention, become most pleasing\r\ncompanions; their topics are before them, and they take the hint. You\r\nfeel so grateful, too, for the hospitality of the log-cabin; such\r\ngratitude as the hospitality of the rich, however generous, cannot\r\ninspire; for these wait on you with their domestics and money, and\r\ngive of their superfluity only; but here the Master gives you his bed,\r\nhis horse, his lamp, his grain from the field, his all, in short; and\r\nyou see that he enjoys doing so thoroughly, and takes no thought for\r\nthe morrow; so that you seem in fields full of lilies perfumed with\r\npure kindness; and feel, verily, that Solomon in all his glory could\r\nnot have entertained you so much to the purpose. Travelling, too,\r\nthrough the wide green woods and prairies, gives a feeling both of\r\nluxury and repose that the sight of highly-cultivated country never\r\ncan. There seems to be room enough for labor to pause and man to fold\r\nhis arms and gaze, forgetting poverty, and care, and the thousand\r\nwalls and fences that in the cultivated region must be built and daily\r\nrepaired both for mind and body. Nature seems to have poured forth her\r\nriches so without calculation, merely to mark the fulness of her joy;\r\nto swell in larger strains the hymn, \"the one Spirit doeth all things\r\nveil, for its life is love.\"\r\n\r\nI will not ask you to write to me now, as I shall so soon be at home.\r\nProbably, too, I shall reserve a visit to B---- for another summer; I\r\nhave been so much a rover that when once on the road I shall wish to\r\nhasten home.\r\n\r\nEver yours, M.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Cambridge, January_ 21, 1644.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ------: I am anxious to get a letter, telling me how you fare\r\nthis winter in the cottage. Your neighbors who come this way do not\r\ngive very favorable accounts of your looks; and, if you are well\r\nenough, I should like to see a few of those firm, well-shaped\r\ncharacters from your own hand. Is there no chance of your coming to\r\nBoston all this winter? I had hoped to see you for a few hours at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nI wrote you one letter while at the West; I know not if it was ever\r\nreceived; it was sent by a private opportunity, one of those \"traps to\r\ncatch the unwary,\" as they have been called. It was no great loss, if\r\nlost. I did not feel like writing letters while travelling. It took\r\nall my strength of mind to keep moving and to receive so many new\r\nimpressions. Surely I never had so clear an idea before of the\r\ncapacity to bless, of mere _Earth_, when fresh from the original\r\nbreath of the creative spirit. To have this impression, one must see\r\nlarge tracts of wild country, where the traces of man's inventions are\r\ntoo few and slight to break the harmony of the first design. It will\r\nnot be so, long, even where I have been now; in three or four years\r\nthose vast flowery plains will be broken up for tillage,--those\r\nshapely groves converted into logs and boards. I wished I could have\r\nkept on now, for two or three years, while yet the first spell rested\r\non the scene. I feel much refreshed, even by this brief intimacy with\r\nNature in an aspect of large and unbroken lineaments.\r\n\r\nI came home with a treasure of bright pictures and suggestions, and\r\nseemingly well. But my strength, which had been sustained by a free,\r\ncareless life in the open air, has yielded to the chills of winter,\r\nand a very little work, with an ease that is not encouraging. However,\r\nI have had the influenza, and that has been about as bad as fever to\r\neverybody. _Now_ I am pretty well, but much writing does not\r\nagree with me.\r\n\r\n* * * I wish you were near enough for me to go in and see you now and\r\nthen. I know that, sick or well, you are always serene, and sufficient\r\nto yourself; but now you are so much shut up, it might animate\r\nexistence agreeably to hear some things I might have to tell. * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n* * * 1844.\r\n\r\nJust as I was beginning to visit the institutions here, of a remedial\r\nand benevolent kind, I was stopped by influenza. So soon as I am quite\r\nwell I shall resume the survey. I do not expect to do much,\r\npractically, for the suffering, but having such an organ of expression\r\nas the _Tribune_, any suggestions that are well grounded may be\r\nof use. I have always felt great interest for those women who are\r\ntrampled in the mud to gratify the brute appetites of men, and I\r\nwished I might be brought, naturally, into contact with them. Now I am\r\nso, and I think I shall have much that is interesting to tell you when\r\nwe meet.\r\n\r\nI go on very moderately, for my strength is not great; but I am now\r\nconnected with a person who is anxious I should not overtask it. I\r\nhope to do more for the paper by-and-by. At present, besides the time\r\nI spend in looking round and examining my new field, I am publishing a\r\nvolume, of which you will receive a copy, called \"Woman in the\r\nNineteenth Century.\" A part of my available time is spent in attending\r\nto it as it goes through the press; for, really, the work seems but\r\nhalf done when your book is _written_. I like being here; the\r\nstreams of life flow free, and I learn much. I feel so far satisfied\r\nas to have laid my plans to stay a year and a half, if not longer, and\r\nto have told Mr. G---- that I probably shall do so. That is long\r\nenough for a mortal to look forward, and not too long, as I must look\r\nforward in order to get what I want from Europe.\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley is a man of genuine excellence, honorable, benevolent, of\r\nan uncorrupted disposition, and of great, abilities.  In modes of life\r\nand manners he is the man of the people, and of the _American_\r\npeople. * * *\r\n\r\nI rejoice to hear that your situation is improved. I hope to pass a\r\nday or two with you next summer, if you can receive me when I can\r\ncome. I want to hear from you now and then, if it be only a line to\r\nlet me know the state of your health. Love to Miss G----, and tell her\r\nI have the cologne-bottle on my mantle-piece now. I sent home for all\r\nthe little gifts I had from friends, that my room might look more\r\nhomelike. My window commands a most beautiful view, for we are quite\r\nout of the town, in a lovely place on the East River. I like this, as\r\nI can be in town when I will, and here have much retirement. You were\r\nright in supposing my signature is the star.\r\n\r\nEver affectionately yours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER BROTHER, R.\r\n\r\n_Fishkill-Landing, Nov 28, 1844._\r\n\r\nDEAR R.:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe seven weeks of proposed abode here draw to a close, and have\r\nbrought what is rarest,--fruition, of the sort proposed from them. I\r\nhave been here all the time, except that three weeks since I went down\r\nto New York, and with ---- visited the prison at Sing-Sing. On\r\nSaturday we went up to Sing-Sing in a little way-boat, thus seeing\r\nthat side of the river to much greater advantage than we can in the\r\nmammoth boats. We arrived in resplendent moonlight, by which we might\r\nhave supposed the prisons palaces, if we had not known too well what\r\nwas within.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday ---- addressed the male convicts in a strain of most noble\r\nand pathetic eloquence. They listened with earnest attention; many\r\nwere moved to tears,--some, I doubt not, to a better life. I never\r\nfelt such sympathy with an audience;--as I looked over that sea of\r\nfaces marked with the traces of every ill, I felt that at least\r\nheavenly truth would not be kept out by self-complacency and a\r\ndependence on good appearances.\r\n\r\nI talked with a circle of women, and they showed the natural aptitude\r\nof the sex for refinement. These women--some black, and all from the\r\nlowest haunts of vice--showed a sensibility and a sense of propriety\r\nwhich would not have disgraced any place.\r\n\r\nReturning, we had a fine storm on the river, clearing up with strong\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER BROTHER,  A. B. F.\r\n\r\n_Rome, Jan._ 20, 1849.\r\n\r\nMy Dear A.: Your letter and mother's gave me the first account of your\r\nillness. Some letters were lost during the summer, I do not know how.\r\nIt did seem very hard upon you to have that illness just after your\r\nsettlement; but it is to be hoped we shall some time know a good\r\nreason for all that seems so strange. I trust you are now becoming\r\nfortified in your health, and if this could only be, feel as if things\r\nwould go well with you in this difficult world. I trust you are on the\r\nthreshold of an honorable and sometimes happy career. From many pains,\r\nmany dark hours, let none of the progeny of Eve hope to escape! * * * *\r\n\r\nMeantime, I hope to find you in your home, and make you a good visit\r\nthere. Your invitation is sweet in its tone, and rouses a vision of\r\nsummer woods and New England Sunday-morning bells.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that mother is at last truly in her sphere, living with\r\none of her children. Watch over her carefully, and don't let her do\r\ntoo much. Her spirit is only all too willing,--but the flesh is weak,\r\nand her life so precious to us all! * * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MAZZINI.\r\n\r\n\"Al Cittadino Reppresentante del Popolo Romano.\"\r\n\r\n_Rome, March_ 8, 1849.\r\n\r\nDear Mazzini: Though knowing you occupied by the most important\r\naffairs, I again feel impelled to write a few lines. What emboldens me\r\nis the persuasion that the best friends, in point of sympathy and\r\nintelligence,--the only friends of a man of ideas and of marked\r\ncharacter,--must be women. You have your mother; no doubt you have\r\nothers, perhaps many. Of that I know nothing; only I like to offer\r\nalso my tribute of affection.\r\n\r\nWhen I think that only two years ago you thought of coming into Italy\r\nwith us in disguise, it seems very glorious that you are about to\r\nenter republican Rome as a Roman citizen. It seems almost the most\r\nsublime and poetical fact of history. Yet, even in the first thrill of\r\njoy, I felt \"he will think his work but beginning, now.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I read from your hand these words, \"II lungo esilio teste\r\nricominciato, la vita non confortata, fuorche d'affetti lontani e\r\ncontesi, e la speranza lungamente protrata, e il desiderio che\r\ncomincia a farmi si supremo, di dormire finalmente in pace, da che non\r\nho potuto, vivere in terra mia,\"--when I read these words they made me\r\nweep bitterly, and I thought of them always with a great pang at the\r\nheart. But it is not so, dear Mazzini,--you do not return to sleep\r\nunder the sod of Italy, but to see your thought springing up all over\r\nthe soil. The gardeners seem to me, in point of instinctive wisdom or\r\ndeep thought, mostly incompetent to the care of the garden; but on\r\nidea like this will be able to make use of any implements. The\r\nnecessity, it is to be hoped, will educate the men, by making them\r\nwork. It is not this, I believe, which still keeps your heart so\r\nmelancholy; for I seem to read the same melancholy in your answer to\r\nthe Roman assembly, You speak of \"few and late years,\" but some full\r\nones still remain. A century is not needed, nor should the same man,\r\nin the same form of thought, work too long on an age. He would mould\r\nand bind it too much to himself. Better for him to die and return\r\nincarnated to give the same truth on yet another side. Jesus of\r\nNazareth died young; but had he not spoken and acted as much truth as\r\nthe world could bear in his time? A frailty, a perpetual short-coming,\r\nmotion in a curve-line, seems the destiny of this earth.\r\n\r\nThe excuse awaits us elsewhere; there must be one,--for it is true,\r\nas said Goethe, \"care is taken that the tree grow not up into the\r\nheavens.\" Men like you, appointed ministers, must not be less earnest\r\nin their work; yet to the greatest, the day, the moment is all their\r\nkingdom, God takes care of the increase.\r\n\r\nFarewell! For your sake I could wish at this moment to be an Italian\r\nand a man of action; but though I am an _American_, I am not even\r\n_a woman of action_; so the best I can do is to pray with the\r\nwhole heart, \"Heaven bless dear Mazzini!--cheer his heart, and give\r\nhim worthy helpers to carry out his holy purposes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. AND MRS. SPRING.\r\n\r\n_Florence, Dec._ 12, 1840.\r\n\r\nDEAR M. AND R.: * * * Your letter, dear R, was written in your noblest\r\nand most womanly spirit. I thank you warmly for your sympathy about my\r\nlittle boy. What he is to me, even you can hardly dream; you that have\r\nthree, in whom the natural thirst of the heart was earlier satisfied,\r\ncan scarcely know what my one ewe-lamb is to me. That he may live,\r\nthat I may find bread for him, that I may not spoil him by overweening\r\nlove, that I may grow daily better for his sake, are the\r\never-recurring thoughts,--say prayers,--that give their hue to all the\r\ncurrent of my life.\r\n\r\nBut, in answer to what you say, that it is still better to give the\r\nworld a living soul than a portion of my life in a printed book, it is\r\ntrue; and yet, of my book I could know whether it would be of some\r\nworth or not; of my child, I must wait to see what his worth will be.\r\nI play with him, my ever-growing mystery! but from the solemnity of\r\nthe thoughts he brings is refuge only in God. Was I worthy to be\r\nparent of a soul, with its eternal, immense capacity for weal and woe?\r\n\"God be merciful to me a sinner!\" comes so naturally to a mother's\r\nheart!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat you say about the Peace way is deeply true; if any one see\r\nclearly how to work in that way, let him, in God's name! Only, if he\r\nabstain from fighting against giant wrongs, let him be sure he is\r\nreally and ardently at work undermining them, or, better still,\r\nsustaining the rights that are to supplant them. Meanwhile, I am not\r\nsure that I can keep my hands free from blood. Cobden is good; but if\r\nhe had stood in Kossuth's place, would he not have drawn his sword\r\nagainst the Austrian? You, could you let a Croat insult your wife,\r\ncarry off your son to be an Austrian serf, and leave your daughter\r\nbleeding in the dust? Yet it is true that while Moses slew the\r\nEgyptian, Christ stood still to be spit upon; and it is true that\r\ndeath to man could do him no harm. You have the truth, you have the\r\nright, but could you act up to it in all circumstances? Stifled under\r\nthe Roman priesthood, would you not have thrown it off with all your\r\nforce? Would you have waited unknown centuries, hoping for the moment\r\nwhen you could see another method?\r\n\r\nYet the agonies of that baptism of blood I feel, O how deeply! in the\r\ngolden June days of Rome. Consistent no way, I felt I should have\r\nshrunk back,--I could not have had it shed. Christ did not have to see\r\nhis dear ones pass the dark river; he could go alone, however, in\r\nprophetic spirit. No doubt he foresaw the crusades.\r\n\r\nIn answer to what you say of ----, I wish the little effort I made for\r\nhim had been wiselier applied. Yet these are not the things one\r\nregrets. It does not do to calculate too closely with the affectionate\r\nhuman impulse. We must be content to make many mistakes, or we should\r\nmove too slowly to help our brothers much.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO HER BROTHER, R.\r\n\r\n_Florence, Jan._ 8, 1850.\r\n\r\nMy Dear R.: * * * * The way in which you speak of my marriage is such\r\nas I expected from you. Now that we have once exchanged words on these\r\nimportant changes in our lives, it matters little to write letters, so\r\nmuch has happened, and the changes are too great to be made clear in\r\nwriting. It would not be worth while to keep the family thinking of\r\nme. I cannot fix precisely the period of my return, though at present\r\nit seems to me probable we may make the voyage in May or June. At\r\nfirst we should wish to go and make a little visit to mother. I should\r\ntake counsel with various friends before fixing myself in any place;\r\nsee what openings there are for me, &c. I cannot judge at all before I\r\nam personally in the United States, and wish to engage myself no way.\r\nShould I finally decide on the neighborhood of New York, I should see\r\nyou all, often. I wish, however, to live with mother, if possible. We\r\nwill discuss it on all sides when I come. Climate is one thing I must\r\nthink of. The change from the Roman winter to that of New England\r\nmight be very trying for Ossoli. In New York he would see Italians\r\noften, hear his native tongue, and feel less exiled. If we had our\r\naffairs in New York and lived in the neighboring country, we could\r\nfind places as quiet as C------, more beautiful, and from which access\r\nto a city would be as easy by means of steam.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, my family and most cherished friends are in New\r\nEngland. I shall weigh all advantages at the time, and choose as may\r\nthen seem best.\r\n\r\nI feel also the great responsibility about a child, and the mixture of\r\nsolemn feeling with the joy its sweet ways and caresses give; yet this\r\nis only different in degree, not in kind, from what we should feel in\r\nother relations. We may more or less impede or brighten the destiny of\r\nall with whom we come in contact. Much as the child lies in our power,\r\nstill God and Nature are there, furnishing a thousand masters to\r\ncorrect our erroneous, and fill up our imperfect, teachings. I feel\r\nimpelled to try for good, for the sake of my child, most powerfully;\r\nbut if I fail, I trust help will be tendered to him from some other\r\nquarter. I do not wish to trouble myself more than is inevitable, or\r\nlose the simple, innocent pleasure of watching his growth from day to\r\nday, by thinking of his future. At present my care of him is to keep\r\nhim pure, in body and mind, to give for body and mind simple nutriment\r\nwhen he requires it, and to play with him. Now he learns, playing, as\r\nwe all shall when we enter a higher existence. With him my intercourse\r\nthus far has been precious, and if I do not well for _him_, he at\r\nleast has taught _me_ a great deal.\r\n\r\nI may say of Ossoli, it would be difficult to help liking him, so\r\nsweet is his disposition, so disinterested without effort, so simply\r\nwise his daily conduct, so harmonious his whole nature. And he is a\r\nperfectly unconscious character, and never dreams that he does well.\r\nHe is studying English, but makes little progress. For a good while\r\nyou may not be able to talk freely with him, but you will like showing\r\nhim your favorite haunts,--he is so happy in nature, so sweet in\r\ntranquil places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO ------.\r\n\r\nWhat a difference it makes to come home to a child! How it fills up\r\nall the gaps of life just in the way that is most consoling, most\r\nrefreshing! Formerly I used to feel sad at that hour; the day had not\r\nbeen nobly spent,--I had not done my duty to myself or others, and I\r\nfelt so lonely! Now I never feel lonely; for, even if my little boy\r\ndies, our souls will remain eternally united. And I feel\r\n_infinite_ hope for him,--hope that he will serve God and man\r\nmore loyally than I have done; and seeing how full he is of life, how\r\nmuch he can afford to throw away, I feel the inexhaustibleness of\r\nnature, and console myself for my own incapacities.\r\n\r\nMadame Arconati is near me. We have had some hours of great content\r\ntogether, but in the last weeks her only child has been dangerously\r\nill. I have no other acquaintance except in the American circle, and\r\nshould not care to make any unless singularly desirable; for I want\r\nall my time for the care of my child, for my walks, and visits to\r\nobjects of art, in which again I can find pleasure, end in the evening\r\nfor study and writing. Ossoli is forming some taste for books; he is\r\nalso studying English; he learns of Horace Sumner, to whom he teaches\r\nItalian in turn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. AND MRS. S.\r\n\r\n_Florence_, Feb. 6, 1850.\r\n\r\nMy Dear M. and R.: You have no doubt ere this received a letter\r\nwritten, I think, in December, but I must suddenly write again to\r\nthank you for the New Year's letter. It was a sweet impulse that led\r\nyou all to write together, and had its full reward in the pleasure you\r\ngave! I have said as little as possible about Ossoli and our relation,\r\nwishing my old friends to form their own impressions naturally, when\r\nthey see us together. I have faith that all who ever knew me will feel\r\nthat I have become somewhat milder, kinder, and more worthy to serve\r\nall who need, for my new relations. I have expected that those who\r\nhave cared for me chiefly for my activity of intellect, would not care\r\nfor him; but that those in whom the moral nature predominates would\r\ngradually learn to love and admire him, and see what a treasure his\r\naffection must be to me. But even that would be only gradually; for it\r\nis by acts, not by words, that one so simple, true, delicate and\r\nretiring, can be known. For me, while some of my friends have thought\r\nme exacting, I may say Ossoli has always outgone my expectations in\r\nthe disinterestedness, the uncompromising bounty, of his every act.\r\n\r\nHe was the same to his father as to me. His affections are few, but\r\nprofound, and thoroughly acted out. His permanent affections are few,\r\nbut his heart is always open to the humble, suffering, heavy-laden.\r\nHis mind has little habitual action, except in a simple, natural\r\npoetry, that one not very intimate with him would never know anything\r\nabout. But once opened to a great impulse, as it was to the hope of\r\nfreeing his country, it rises to the height of the occasion, and stays\r\nthere. His enthusiasm is quiet, but unsleeping. He is very unlike most\r\nItalians, but very unlike most Americans, too. I do not expect all who\r\ncared for me to care for him, nor is it of importance to him that they\r\nshould. He is wholly without vanity. He is too truly the gentleman not\r\nto be respected by all persons of refinement. For the rest, if my life\r\nis free, and not too much troubled, if he can enjoy his domestic\r\naffections, and fulfil his duties in his own way, he will be content.\r\nCan we find this much for ourselves in bustling America the next three\r\nor four years? I know not, but think we shall come and try. I wish\r\nmuch to see you all, and exchange the kiss of peace. There will, I\r\ntrust, be peace within, if not without. I thank you most warmly for\r\nyour gift. Be assured it will turn to great profit. I have learned to\r\nbe a great adept in economy, by looking at my little boy. I cannot\r\nbear to spend a cent for fear he may come to want. I understand now\r\nhow the family-men get so mean, and shall have to begin soon to pray\r\nagainst that danger. My little Nino, as we call him for house and pet\r\nname, is in perfect health. I wash, and dress, and sew for him; and\r\nthink I see a great deal of promise in his little ways, and shall know\r\nhim better for doing all for him, though it is fatiguing and\r\ninconvenient at times. He is very gay and laughing, sometimes\r\nviolent,--for he is come to the age when he wants everything in his\r\nown hands,--but, on the whole, sweet as yet, and very fond of me. He\r\noften calls me to kiss him. He says, \"kiss,\" in preference to the\r\nItalian word bacio. I do not cherish sanguine visions about him, but\r\ntry to do my best by him, and enjoy the present moment.\r\n\r\nIt was a nice account you gave of Miss Bremer. She found some\r\n\"neighbors\" as good as her own. You say she was much pleased by ----;\r\ncould she know her, she might enrich the world with a portrait as full\r\nof little delicate traits as any in her gallery, and of a higher class\r\nthan any in which she has been successful. I would give much that a\r\ncompetent person should paint ----. It is a shame she should die and\r\nleave the world no copy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO MR. CASS, CHARGE D'AFFAIRES DES ETATS UNIS D'AMERIQUE.\r\n\r\n_Florence, May_ 2, 1850.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Cass: I shall most probably leave Florence and Italy the 8th\r\nor 10th of this month, and am not willing to depart without saying\r\nadieu to yourself. I wanted to write the 30th of April, but a\r\nsuccession of petty interruptions prevented. That was the day I saw\r\nyou first, and the day the French first assailed Rome. What a crowded\r\nday that was! I had been to visit Ossoli in the morning, in the garden\r\nof the Vatican. Just after my return you entered. I then went to the\r\nhospital, and there passed the eight amid the groans of many suffering\r\nand some dying men. What a strange first of May it was, as I walked\r\nthe streets of Rome by the early sunlight of the nest day! Those were\r\nto me grand and impassioned hours. Deep sorrow followed,--many\r\nembarrassments, many pains! Let me once more, at parting, thank you\r\nfor the sympathy you showed me amid many of these. A thousand years\r\nmight pass, and you would find it unforgotten by me.\r\n\r\nI leave Italy with profound regret, and with only a vague hope of\r\nreturning. I could have lived here always, full of bright visions, and\r\nexpanding in my faculties, had destiny permitted. May you be happy who\r\nremain here! It would be well worth while to be happy in Italy!\r\n\r\nI had hoped to enjoy some of the last days, but the weather has been\r\nsteadily bad since you left Florence. Since the 4th of April we have\r\nnot had a fine day, and all our little plans for visits to favorite\r\nspots and beautiful objects, from which we have long been separated,\r\nhave been marred!\r\n\r\nI sail in the barque Elizabeth for New York. She is laden with marble\r\nand rags--a very appropriate companionship for wares of Italy! She\r\ncarries Powers' statue of Calhoun. Adieu! Remember that we look to you\r\nto keep up the dignity of our country. Many important occasions are\r\nnow likely to offer for the American (I wish I could write the\r\nColumbian) man to advocate,--more, to _represent_ the cause of\r\nTruth and Freedom in the face of their foes. Remember me as their\r\nlover, and your friend, M. O.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo ------.\r\n\r\n_Florence_, _April_ 16, 1860.\r\n\r\n* * * There is a bark at Leghorn, highly spoken of, which sails at the\r\nend of this month, and we shall very likely take that. I find it\r\nimperatively necessary to go to the United States to make arrangements\r\nthat may free me from care. Shall I be more fortunate if I go in\r\nperson? I do not know. I am ill adapted to push my claims and\r\npretensions; but, at least, it will not be such slow work as passing\r\nfrom disappointment to disappointment here, where I wait upon the\r\npost-office, and must wait two or three months, to know the fate of\r\nany proposition.\r\n\r\nI go home prepared to expect all that is painful and difficult. It\r\nwill be a consolation to see my dear mother; and my dear brother E.,\r\nwhom I have not seen for ten years, is coming to New England this\r\nsummer. On that account I wish to go _this_ year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_May_ 10.--My head is full of boxes, bundles, phials of medicine,\r\nand pots of jelly. I never thought much about a journey for myself,\r\nexcept to try and return all the things, books especially, which I had\r\nbeen borrowing; but about my child I feel anxious lest I should not\r\ntake what is necessary for his health and comfort on so long a voyage,\r\nwhere omissions are irreparable. The unpropitious, rainy weather\r\ndelays us now from day to day, as our ship; the Elizabeth,--(look out\r\nfor news of shipwreck!) cannot finish taking in her cargo till come\r\none or two good days.\r\n\r\nI leave Italy with most sad and unsatisfied heart,--hoping, indeed, to\r\nreturn, but fearing that may not be permitted in my \"cross-biased\"\r\nlife, till strength of feeling and keenness of perception be less than\r\nduring these bygone rich, if troubled, years!\r\n\r\nI can say least to those whom I prize most. I am so sad and weary,\r\nleaving Italy, that I seem paralyzed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTO THE SAME.\r\n\r\n_Ship Elizabeth, off Gibraltar, June_ 8, 1850.\r\n\r\nMy Dear M----: You will, I trust, long ere receiving this, have read\r\nmy letter from Florence, enclosing one to my mother, informing her\r\nunder what circumstances I had drawn on you through ----, and\r\nmentioning how I wished the bill to be met in case of any accident to\r\nme on my homeward course. That course, as respects weather, has been\r\nthus far not unpleasant; but the disaster that has befallen us is such\r\nas I never dreamed of. I had taken passage with Captain Hasty--one who\r\nseemed to me one of the best and most high-minded of our American men.\r\nHe showed the kindest interest in us. His wife, an excellent woman,\r\nwas with him. I thought, during the voyage, if safe and my child well,\r\nto have as much respite from care and pain as sea-sickness would\r\npermit. But scarcely was that enemy in some measure quelled, when the\r\ncaptain fell sick. At first his disease presented the appearance of\r\nnervous fever. I was with him a great deal; indeed, whenever I could\r\nrelieve his wife from a ministry softened by great love and the\r\ncourage of womanly heroism: The last days were truly terrible with\r\ndisgusts and fatigues; for he died, we suppose,--no physician has been\r\nallowed to come on board to see the body,--of confluent small-pox. I\r\nhave seen, since we parted, great suffering, but nothing physical to\r\nbe compared to this, where the once fair and expressive mould of man\r\nis thus lost in corruption before life has fled. He died yesterday\r\nmorning, and was buried in deep water, the American Consul's barge\r\ntowing out one from this ship which bore the body, about six o'clock.\r\nIt was Sunday. A divinely calm, glowing afternoon had succeeded a\r\nmorning of bleak, cold wind. You cannot think how beautiful the whole\r\nthing was:--the decent array and sad reverence of the sailors; the\r\nmany ships with their banners flying; the stern pillar of Hercules all\r\nbathed in roseate vapor; the little white sails diving into the blue\r\ndepths with that solemn spoil of the good man, so still, when he had\r\nbeen so agonized and gasping as the last sun stooped. Yes, it was\r\nbeautiful; but how dear a price we pay for the poems of this world! We\r\nshall now be in quarantine a week; no person permitted to come on\r\nboard until it be seen whether disease break out in other cases. I\r\nhave no good reason to think it will _not_; yet I do not feel\r\nafraid. Ossoli has had it; so he is safe. The baby is, of course,\r\nsubject to injury. In the earlier days, before I suspected small-pox,\r\nI carried him twice into the sick-room, at the request of the captain,\r\nwho was becoming fond of him. He laughed and pointed; he did not\r\ndiscern danger, but only thought it odd to see the old friend there in\r\nbed. It is vain by prudence to seek to evade the stern assaults of\r\ndestiny. I submit. Should all end well, we shall be in New York later\r\nthan I expected; but keep a look-out. Should we arrive safely, I\r\nshould like to see a friendly face. Commend me to my dear friends;\r\nand, with most affectionate wishes that joy and peace may continue to\r\ndwell in your house, adieu, and love as you can,\r\n\r\nYour friend, MARGARET.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM HON. LEWIS CASS, JR., UNITED STATES CHARGE D'AFFAIRES AT\r\nROME, TO MRS. E. K. CHANNING.\r\n\r\n_Legation des Etats Unis d'Amerique, Rome, May_ 10, 1851.\r\n\r\nMadame: I beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the\r\n---- ult., and to express my regret that the weak state of my eyesight\r\nhas prevented me from giving it an earlier reply.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your request, I have the honor to state, succinctly,\r\nthe circumstances connected with my acquaintance with the late Madame\r\nOssoli, your deceased sister, during her residence in Rome.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April, 1849, Rome, as you are no doubt aware, was\r\nplaced in a state of siege by the approach of the French army. It was\r\nfilled at that time with exiles and fugitives who had been contending\r\nfor years, from Milan in the north to Palermo in the south, for the\r\nrepublican cause; and when the gates were closed, it was computed that\r\nthere were, of Italians alone, thirteen thousand refugees within the\r\nwalls of the city, all of whom had been expelled from adjacent states,\r\ntill Rome became their last rallying-point, and, to many, their final\r\nresting-place. Among these was to be seen every variety of age,\r\nsentiment, and condition,--striplings and blanched heads; wild,\r\nvisionary enthusiasts; grave, heroic men, who, in the struggle for\r\nfreedom, had ventured all, and lost all; nobles and beggars; bandits,\r\nfelons and brigands. Great excitement naturally existed; and, in the\r\ngeneral apprehension which pervaded all classes, that acts of personal\r\nviolence and outrage would soon be committed, the foreign residents,\r\nespecially, found themselves placed in an alarming situation.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of April the first engagement took place between the\r\nFrench and Roman troops, and in a few days subsequently I visited\r\nseveral of my countrymen, at their request, to concert measures for\r\ntheir safety. Hearing, on that occasion, and for the first time, of\r\nMiss Fuller's presence in Rome, and of her solitary mode of life, I\r\nventured to call upon her, and offer my services in any manner that\r\nmight conduce to her comfort and security. She received me with much\r\nkindness, and thus an acquaintance commenced. Her residence on the\r\nPiazzi Barberini being considered an insecure abode, she removed to\r\nthe Casa Dies, which was occupied by several American families.\r\n\r\nIn the engagements which succeeded between the Roman and French\r\ntroops, the wounded of the former were brought into the city, and\r\ndisposed throughout the different hospitals, which were under the\r\nsuperintendence of several ladies of high rank, who had formed\r\nthemselves into associations, the better to ensure care and attention\r\nto those unfortunate men. Miss Fuller took an active part in this\r\nnoble work; and the greater portion of her time, during the entire\r\nsiege, was passed in the hospital of the Trinity of the Pilgrims,\r\nwhich was placed under her direction, in attendance upon its inmates.\r\n\r\nThe weather was intensely hot; her health was feeble and delicate; the\r\ndead and dying were around her in every stage of pain and horror; but\r\nshe never shrank from the duty she had assumed. Her heart and soul\r\nwere in the cause for which those men had fought, and all was done\r\nthat Woman could do to comfort them in their sufferings. I have seen\r\nthe eyes of the dying, as she moved among them, extended on opposite\r\nbeds, meet in commendation of her universal kindness; and the friends\r\nof those who then passed away may derive consolation from the\r\nassurance that nothing of tenderness and attention was wanting to\r\nsoothe their last moments. And I have heard many of those who\r\nrecovered speak with all the passionate fervor of the Italian nature,\r\nof her whose sympathy and compassion, throughout their long illness,\r\nfulfilled all the offices of love and affection. Mazzini, the chief of\r\nthe Triumvirate, who, better than any man in Rome, knew her worth,\r\noften expressed to me his admiration of her high character; and the\r\nPrincess Belgiojoso. to whom was assigned the charge of the Papal\r\nPalace, on the Quirinal, which was converted on this occasion into a\r\nhospital, was enthusiastic in her praise. And in a letter which I\r\nreceived not long since from this lady, who was gaining the bread of\r\nan exile by teaching languages in Constantinople, she alludes with\r\nmuch feeling to the support afforded by Miss Fuller to the republican\r\nparty in Italy. Here, in Rome, she is still spoken of in terms of\r\nregard and endearment, and the announcement of her death was received\r\nwith a degree of sorrow not often bestowed upon a foreigner,\r\nespecially one of a different faith.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of June, the bombardment from the French camp was very\r\nheavy, shells and grenades falling in every part of the city. In the\r\nafternoon of the 30th, I received a brief note from Miss Fuller,\r\nrequesting me to call at her residence. I did so without delay, and\r\nfound her lying on a sofa, pale and trembling, evidently much\r\nexhausted. She informed me that she had sent for me to place in my\r\nhand a packet of important papers, which she wished me to keep for the\r\npresent, and, in the event of her death, to transmit it to her friends\r\nin the United States. She then stated that she was married to Marquis\r\nOssoli, who was in command of a battery on the Pincian Hill,--that\r\nbeing the highest and most exposed position in Rome, and directly in\r\nthe line of bombs from the French camp. It was not to be expected, she\r\nsaid, that he could escape the dangers of another night, such as the\r\nlast; and therefore it was her intention to remain with him, and share\r\nhis fate. At the Ave Maria, she added, he would come for her, and they\r\nwould proceed together to his post. The packet which she placed in my\r\npossession, contained, she said, the certificates of her marriage, and\r\nof the birth and baptism of her child. After a few words more, I took\r\nmy departure, the hour she named having nearly arrived. At the\r\nporter's lodge I met the Marquis Ossoli, and a few moments afterward I\r\nsaw them walking toward the Pincian Hill.\r\n\r\nHappily, the cannonading was not renewed that night, and at dawn of\r\nday she returned to her apartments, with her husband by her side. On\r\nthat day the French army entered Rome, and, the gates being opened,\r\nMadame Ossoli, accompanied by the Marquis, immediately proceeded to\r\nRieti, where she had left her child in the charge of a confidential\r\nnurse, formerly in the service of the Ossoli family.\r\n\r\nShe remained, as you are no doubt aware, some months at Rieti, whence\r\nshe removed to Florence, where she resided until her ill-fated\r\ndeparture for the United States. During this period I received several\r\nletters from her, all of which, though reluctant to part with them, I\r\nenclose to your address in compliance with your request.\r\n\r\nI am, Madame, very respectfully,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\n\r\nLEWIS CASS, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nApparition of the goddess Isis to her votary, from Apulelus.\r\n\r\n\"Scarcely had I closed my eyes, when, behold (I saw in a dream), a\r\ndivine form emerging from the middle of the sea, and raising a\r\ncountenance venerable even to the gods themselves. Afterward, the\r\nwhole of the most splendid image seemed to stand before me, having\r\ngradually shaken off the sea. I will endeavor to explain to you its\r\nadmirable form, if the poverty of human language will but afford me\r\nthe power of an appropriate narration; or if the divinity itself, of\r\nthe most luminous form, will supply me with a liberal abundance of\r\nfluent diction. In the first place, then, her most copious and long\r\nhairs, being gradually intorted, and promiscuously scattered on her\r\ndivine neck, were softly defluous. A multiform crown, consisting of\r\nvarious flowers, bound the sublime summit of her head. And in the\r\nmiddle of the crown, just on her forehead, there was a smooth orb,\r\nresembling a mirror, or rather a white refulgent light, which\r\nindicated that she was the moon. Vipers, rising up after the manner of\r\nfurrows, environed the crown on the right hand and on the left, and\r\nCerealian ears of corn were also extended from above. Her garment was\r\nof many colors, and woven from the finest flax, and was at one time\r\nlucid with a white splendor, at another yellow, from the flower of\r\ncrocus, and at another flaming with a rosy redness. But that which\r\nmost excessively dazzled my sight, was a very black robe, fulgid with\r\na dark splendor, and which, spreading round and passing under her\r\nright side, and ascending to her left shoulder, there rose\r\nprotuberant, like the centre of a shield, the dependent part of her\r\nrobe falling in many folds, and having small knots of fringe,\r\ngracefully flowing in its extremities. Glittering stars were dispersed\r\nthrough the embroidered border of the robe, and through the whole of\r\nits surface, and the full moon, shining in the middle of the stars,\r\nbreathed forth flaming fires. A crown, wholly consisting of flowers\r\nand fruits of every kind, adhered with indivisible connection to the\r\nborder of conspicuous robe, in all its undulating motions.\r\n\r\n\"What she carried in her hands also consisted of things of a very\r\ndifferent nature. Her right hand bore a brazen rattle, through the\r\nnarrow lamina of which, bent like a belt, certain rods passing,\r\nproduced a sharp triple sound through the vibrating motion of her arm.\r\nAn oblong vessel, in the shape of a boat, depended from her left hand,\r\non the handle of which, in that part which was conspicuous, an asp\r\nraised its erect head and largely swelling neck. And shoes, woven from\r\nthe leaves of the victorious palm-tree, covered her immortal feet.\r\nSuch, and so great a goddess, breathing the fragrant odor of the\r\nshores of Arabia the happy, deigned thus to address me.\"\r\n\r\nThe foreign English of the translator, Thomas Taylor, gives this\r\ndescription the air of being itself a part of the mysteries. But its\r\nmajestic beauty requires no formal initiation to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nB.\r\n\r\nI give this in the original, as it does not bear translation.

But, says the Mythes, when she\r\nascended the throne of Odin, her consort (Heaven), she left with\r\nmortals her friend, the Goddess of Sympathy, to protect them in her\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nSince, Sympathy goes about to do good. Especially she devotes herself\r\nto the most valiant and the most oppressed. She consoles the gods in\r\nsome degree even for the death of their darling Baldur. Among the\r\nheavenly powers she has no consort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nC.\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING OF THE LADY THERESA.\r\n\r\nFrom Lockhart's Spanish ballads.\r\n\r\n  'Twas when the fifth Alphonso in Leon held his sway,\r\n    King Abdulla of Toledo an embassy did send;\r\n  He asked his sister for a wife, and in an evil day\r\n    Alphonso sent her, for he feared Abdalla to offend;\r\n  He feared to move his anger, for many times before\r\n  He had received in danger much succor from the Moor.\r\n\r\n  Sad heart had fair Theresa, when she their paction knew;\r\n    With streaming tears she heard them tell she 'mong the Moors must go;\r\n  That she, a Christian damsel, a Christian firm and true,\r\n    Must wed a Moorish husband, it well might cause her woe;\r\n  But all her tears and all her prayers they are of small avail;\r\n    At length she for her fate prepares, a victim sad and pale.\r\n\r\n  The king hath sent his sister to fair Toledo town,\r\n    Where then the Moor Abdalla his royal state did keep;\r\n  When she drew near, the Moslem from his golden throne came down,\r\n    And courteously received her, and bade her cease to weep;\r\n  With loving words he pressed her to come his bower within;\r\n  With kisses he caressed her, but still she feared the sin.\r\n\r\n  \"Sir King, Sir King, I pray thee,\"--'twas thus Theresa spake,--\r\n    \"I pray thee, have compassion, and do to me no wrong;\r\n  For sleep with thee I may not, unless the vows I break,\r\n    Whereby I to the holy church of Christ my lord belong;\r\n  For thou hast sworn to serve Mahoun, and if this thing should be,\r\n  The curse of God it must bring down upon thy realm and thee.\r\n\r\n  \"The angel of Christ Jesu, to whom my heavenly Lord\r\n    Hath given my soul in keeping, is ever by my side;\r\n  If thou dost me dishonor, he will unsheathe his sword,\r\n    And smite thy body fiercely, at the crying of thy bride;\r\n  Invisible he standeth; his sword like fiery flame\r\n  Will penetrate thy bosom the hour that sees my shame.\"\r\n\r\n  The Moslem heard her with a smile; the earnest words she said\r\n    He took for bashful maiden's wile, and drew her to his bower:\r\n  In vain Theresa prayed and strove,--she pressed Abdalla's bed,\r\n    Perforce received his kiss of love, and lost her maiden flower.\r\n  A woeful woman there she lay, a loving lord beside,\r\n  And earnestly to God did pray her succor to provide.\r\n\r\n  The angel of Christ Jesu her sore complaint did hear,\r\n    And plucked his heavenly weapon from out his sheath unseen:\r\n  He waved the brand in his right hand, and to the King came near,\r\n    And drew the point o'er limb and joint, beside the weeping Queen:\r\n  A mortal weakness from the stroke upon the King did fall;\r\n  He could not stand when daylight broke, but on his knees must crawl.\r\n\r\n  Abdalla shuddered inly, when he this sickness felt,\r\n    And called upon his barons, his pillow to come nigh;\r\n  \"Rise up,\" he said, \"my liegemen,\" as round his bed they knelt,\r\n    \"And take this Christian lady, else certainly I die;\r\n  Let gold be in your girdles, and precious stones beside,\r\n  And swiftly ride to Leon, and render up my bride.\"\r\n\r\n  When they were come to Leon Theresa would not go\r\n    Into her brother's dwelling, where her maiden years were spent;\r\n  But o'er her downcast visage a white veil she did throw,\r\n    And to the ancient nunnery of Las Huelgas went.\r\n  There, long, from worldly eyes retired, a holy life she led;\r\n  There she, an aged saint, expired; there sleeps she with the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following extract from Spinoza is worthy of attention, as\r\nexpressing the view which a man of the largest intellectual scope may\r\ntake of Woman, if that part of his life to which her influence appeals\r\nhas been left unawakened. He was a man of the largest intellect, of\r\nunsurpassed reasoning powers; yet he makes a statement false to\r\nhistory, for we well know how often men and women have ruled together\r\nwithout difficulty, and one in which very few men even at the present\r\nday--I mean men who are thinkers, like him--would acquiesce.\r\n\r\nI have put in contrast with it three expressions of the latest\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nFirst, from the poems of W. E. Channing, a poem called \"Reverence,\"\r\nequally remarkable for the deep wisdom of its thought and the beauty\r\nof its utterance, and containing as fine a description of one class of\r\nwomen as exists in literature.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this picture of Woman, the happy Goddess of Beauty,\r\nthe wife, the friend, \"the summer queen,\" I add one by the author of\r\n\"Festus,\" of a woman of the muse, the sybil kind, which seems painted\r\nfrom living experience.\r\n\r\nAnd, thirdly, I subjoin Eugene Sue's description of a wicked but able\r\nwoman of the practical sort, and appeal to all readers whether a\r\nspecies that admits of three such varieties is so easily to be classed\r\naway, or kept within prescribed limits, as Spinoza, and those who\r\nthink like him, believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINOZA. TRACTATUS POLITICI DE DEMOCRATIA.\r\nCAPUT XI.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some one will here ask, whether the supremacy of Man over\r\nWoman is attributable to nature or custom? Since, if It be human\r\ninstitutions alone to which this fact is owing, there is no reason why\r\nwe should exclude women from a share in government. Experience most\r\nplainly teaches that it is Woman's weakness which places her under the\r\nauthority of Man. It has nowhere happened that men and women ruled\r\ntogether; but wherever men and women are found, the world over, there\r\nwe see the men ruling and the women ruled, and in this order of things\r\nmen and women live together in peace and harmony. The Amazons, it is\r\ntrue, are reputed formerly to have held the reins of government, but\r\nthey drove men from their dominions; the male of their offspring they\r\ninvariably destroyed, permitting their daughters alone to live. Now,\r\nif women were by nature upon an equality with men, if they equalled\r\nmen in fortitude, in genius (qualities which give to men might, and\r\nconsequently right), it surely would be the case, that, among the\r\nnumerous and diverse nations of the earth, some would be found where\r\nboth sexes ruled conjointly, and others where the men were ruled by\r\nthe women, and so educated as to be mentally inferior; and since this\r\nstate of things nowhere exists, it is perfectly fair to infer that the\r\nrights of women are not equal to those of men; but that women must be\r\nsubordinate, and therefore cannot have an equal, far less a superior\r\nplace in the government. If, too, we consider the passions of men--how\r\nthe love men feel towards women is seldom anything but lust and\r\nimpulse, and much less a reverence for qualities of soul than an\r\nadmiration of physical beauty; observing, too, the jealousy of lovers,\r\nand other things of the same character--we shall see at a glance that\r\nit would be, in the highest degree, detrimental to peace and harmony,\r\nfor men and women to possess on equal share in government.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERENCE.\r\n\r\n                 As an ancestral heritage revere\r\n  All learning, and all thought. The painter's fame\r\n  Is thine, whate'er thy lot, who honorest grace.\r\n  And need enough in this low time, when they,\r\n  Who seek to captivate the fleeting notes\r\n  Of heaven's sweet beauty, must despair almost,\r\n  So heavy and obdurate show the hearts\r\n  Of their companions. Honor kindly then\r\n  Those who bear up in their so generous arms\r\n  The beautiful ideas of matchless forms;\r\n  For were these not portrayed, our human fate,--\r\n  Which is to be all high, majestical,\r\n  To grow to goodness with each coming age,\r\n  Till virtue leap and sing for joy to see\r\n  So noble, virtuous men,--would brief decay;\r\n  And the green, festering slime, oblivious, haunt\r\n  About our common fate. O, honor them!\r\n\r\n  But what to all true eyes has chiefest charm,\r\n  And what to every breast where beats a heart\r\n  Framed to one beautiful emotion,--to\r\n  One sweet and natural feeling, lends a grace\r\n  To all the tedious walks of common life,\r\n  This is fair Woman,--Woman, whose applause\r\n  Each poet sings,--Woman the beautiful.\r\n  Not that her fairest brow, or gentlest form,\r\n  Charm us to tears; not that the smoothest cheek,\r\n  Wherever rosy tints have made their home,\r\n  So rivet us on her; but that she is\r\n  The subtle, delicate grace,--the inward grace,\r\n  For words too excellent; the noble, true,\r\n  The majesty of earth; the summer queen;\r\n  In whose conceptions nothing but what's great\r\n  Has any right. And, O! her love for him,\r\n  Who does but his small part in honoring her;\r\n  Discharging a sweet office, sweeter none,\r\n  Mother and child, friend, counsel and repose;\r\n  Naught matches with her, naught has leave with her\r\n  To highest human praise. Farewell to him\r\n  Who reverences not with an excess\r\n  Of faith the beauteous sex; all barren he\r\n  Shall live a living death of mockery.\r\n  Ah! had but words the power, what could we say\r\n  Of Woman! We, rude men of violent phrase,\r\n  Harsh action, even in repose inwardly harsh;\r\n  Whose lives walk blustering on high stilts, removed\r\n  From all the purely gracious influence\r\n  Of mother earth. To single from the host\r\n  Of angel forms one only, and to her\r\n  Devote our deepest heart and deepest mind,\r\n  Seems almost contradiction. Unto her\r\n  We owe our greatest blessings, hours of cheer,\r\n  Gay smiles, and sudden tears, and more than these\r\n  A sure perpetual love. Regard her as\r\n  She walks along the vast still earth; and see!\r\n  Before her flies a laughing troop of joys,\r\n  And by her side treads old experience,\r\n  With never-failing voice admonitory;\r\n  The gentle, though infallible, kind advice,\r\n  The watchful care, the fine regardfulness,\r\n  Whatever mates with what we hope to find,\r\n  All consummate in her--the summer queen.\r\n\r\n  To call past ages better than what now\r\n  Man is enacting on life's crowded stage,\r\n  Cannot improve our worth; and for the world\r\n  Blue is the sky as ever, and the stars\r\n  Kindle their crystal flames at soft fallen eve\r\n  With the same purest lustre that the east\r\n  Worshipped. The river gently flows through fields\r\n  Where the broad-leaved corn spreads out, and loads\r\n  Its ear as when the Indian tilled the soil.\r\n  The dark green pine,--green in the winter's cold,--\r\n  Still whispers meaning emblems, as of old;\r\n  The cricket chirps, and the sweet eager birds\r\n  In the sad woods crowd their thick melodies;\r\n  But yet, to common eyes, life's poetry\r\n  Something has faded, and the cause of this\r\n  May be that Man, no longer at the shrine\r\n  Of Woman, kneeling with true reverence,\r\n  In spite of field, wood, river, stars and sea,\r\n  Goes most disconsolate. A babble now,\r\n  A huge and wind-swelled babble, fills the place\r\n  Of that great adoration which of old\r\n  Man had for Woman. In these days no more\r\n  Is love the pith and marrow of Man's fate.\r\n  Thou who in early years feelest awake\r\n  To finest impulses from nature's breath,\r\n  And in thy walk hearest such sounds of truth\r\n  As on the common ear strike without heed,\r\n  Beware of men around thee! Men are foul\r\n  With avarice, ambition and deceit;\r\n  The worst of all, ambition. This is life,\r\n  Spent in a feverish chase for selfish ends,\r\n  Which has no virtue to redeem its toil,\r\n  But one long, stagnant hope to raise the self.\r\n  The miser's life to this seems sweet and fair;\r\n  Better to pile the glittering coin, than seek\r\n  To overtop our brothers and our loves.\r\n  Merit in this?  Where lies it, though thy name\r\n  Ring over distant lands, meeting the wind\r\n  Even on the extremest verge of the wide world?\r\n  Merit in this? Better be hurled abroad\r\n  On the vast whirling tide, than, in thyself\r\n  Concentred, feed upon thy own applause.\r\n  Thee shall the good man yield no reverence;\r\n  But, while the Idle, dissolute crowd are loud\r\n  In voice to send thee flattery, shall rejoice\r\n  That he has 'scaped thy fatal doom, and known\r\n  How humble faith in the good soul of things\r\n  Provides amplest enjoyment. O, my brother\r\n  If the Past's counsel any honor claim\r\n  From thee, go read the history of those\r\n  Who a like path have trod, and see a fate\r\n  Wretched with fears, changing like leaves at noon,\r\n  When the new wind sings in the white birch wood.\r\n  Learn from the simple child the rule of life,\r\n  And from the movements of the unconscious tribes\r\n  Of animal nature, those that bend the wing\r\n  Or cleave the azure tide, content to be,\r\n  What the great frame provides,--freedom and grace.\r\n  Thee, simple child, do the swift winds obey,\r\n  And the white waterfalls with their bold leaps\r\n  Follow thy movements. Tenderly the light\r\n  Thee watches, girding with a zone of radiance,\r\n  And all the swinging herbs love thy soft steps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF ANGELA, FROM \"FESTUS.\"\r\n\r\n  I loved her for that she was beautiful,\r\n  And that to me she seemed to be all nature\r\n  And all varieties of things in one;\r\n  Would set at night in clouds of tears, and rise\r\n  All light and laughter in the morning; fear\r\n  No petty customs nor appearances,\r\n  But think what others only dreamed about;\r\n  And say what others did but think; and do\r\n  What others would but say; and glory in\r\n  What others dared but do; it was these which won me;\r\n  And that she never schooled within her breast\r\n  One thought or feeling, but gave holiday\r\n  To all; that she told me all her woes,\r\n  And wrongs, and ills; and so she made them mine\r\n  In the communion of love; and we\r\n  Grew like each other, for we loved each other;\r\n  She, mild and generous as the sun in spring; And\r\n  I, like earth, all budding out with love.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The beautiful are never desolate;\r\n  For some one alway loves them; God or man;\r\n  If man abandons, God himself takes them;\r\n  And thus it was. She whom I once loved died;\r\n  The lightning loathes its cloud; the soul its clay.\r\n  Can I forget the hand I took in mine,\r\n  Pale as pale violets; that eye, where mind\r\n  And matter met alike divine?--ah, no!\r\n  May God that moment judge me when I do!\r\n  O! she was fair; her nature once all spring\r\n  And deadly beauty, like a maiden sword,\r\n  Startlingly beautiful. I see her now!\r\n  Wherever thou art thy soul is in my mind;\r\n  Thy shadow hourly lengthens o'er my brain\r\n  And peoples all its pictures with thyself;\r\n  Gone, not forgotten; passed, not lost; thou wilt shine\r\n  In heaven like a bright spot in the sun!\r\n  She said she wished to die, and so she died,\r\n  For, cloudlike, she poured out her love, which was\r\n  Her life, to freshen this parched heart. It was thus;\r\n  I said we were to part, but she said nothing;\r\n  There was no discord; it was music ceased,\r\n  Life's thrilling, bursting, bounding joy. She sate,\r\n  Like a house-god, her hands fixed on her knee,\r\n  And her dark hair lay loose and long behind her,\r\n  Through which her wild bright eye flashed like a flint;\r\n  She spake not, moved not, but she looked the more,\r\n  As if her eye were action, speech, and feeling.\r\n  I felt it all, and came and knelt beside her,\r\n  The electric touch solved both our souls together;\r\n  Then came the feeling which unmakes, undoes;\r\n  Which tears the sea-like soul up by the roots,\r\n  And lashes it in scorn against the skies.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  It is the saddest and the sorest sight,\r\n  One's own love weeping. But why call on God?\r\n  But that the feeling of the boundless bounds\r\n  All feeling; as the welkin does the world;\r\n  It is this which ones us with the whole and God.\r\n  Then first we wept; then closed and clung together;\r\n  And my heart shook this building of my breast\r\n  Like a live engine booming up and down;\r\n  She fell upon me like a snow-wreath thawing.\r\n  Never were bliss and beauty, love and woe,\r\n  Ravelled and twined together into madness,\r\n  As in that one wild hour to which all else\r\n  The past is but a picture. That alone\r\n  Is real, and forever there in front.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  * * * After that I left her,\r\n  And only saw her once again alive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mother Saint Perpetua, the superior of the convent, was a tall woman,\r\nof about forty years, dressed in dark gray serge, with a long rosary\r\nhanging at her girdle. A white mob-cap, with a long black veil,\r\nsurrounded her thin, wan face with its narrow, hooded border. A great\r\nnumber of deep, transverse wrinkles ploughed her brow, which resembled\r\nyellowish ivory in color and substance. Her keen and prominent nose\r\nwas curved like the hooked beak of a bird of prey; her black eye was\r\npiercing and sagacious; her face was at once intelligent, firm, and\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\"For comprehending and managing the material interests of the society,\r\nMother Saint Perpetua could have vied with the shrewdest and most wily\r\nlawyer. When women are possessed of what is called _business\r\ntalent_, and when they apply thereto the sharpness of perception,\r\nthe indefatigable perseverance, the prudent dissimulation, and, above\r\nall, the correctness and rapidity of judgment at first sight, which\r\nare peculiar to them, they arrive at prodigious results.\r\n\r\n\"To Mother Saint Perpetua, a woman of a strong and solid head, the\r\nvast moneyed business of the society was but child's play. None better\r\nthan she understood how to buy depreciated properties, to raise them\r\nto their original value, and sell them to advantage; the average\r\npurchase of rents, the fluctuations of exchange, and the current\r\nprices of shares in all the leading speculations, were perfectly\r\nfamiliar to her. Never had she directed her agents to make a single\r\nfalse speculation, when it had been the question how to invest funds,\r\nwith which good souls were constantly endowing the society of Saint\r\nMary. She had established in the house a degree of order, of\r\ndiscipline, and, above all, of economy, that were indeed remarkable;\r\nthe constant aim of all her exertions being, not to enrich herself,\r\nbut the community over which she presided; for the spirit of\r\nassociation, when it is directed to an object of _collective\r\nselfishness_, gives to corporations all the faults and vices of\r\nindividuals.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nE.\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter addressed to me by one of\r\nthe monks of the nineteenth century. A part I have omitted, because it\r\ndoes not express my own view, unless with qualifications which I could\r\nnot make, except by full discussion of the subject.\r\n\r\n\"Woman in the Nineteenth Century should be a pure, chaste, holy being.\r\n\r\n\"This state of being in Woman is no more attained by the expansion of\r\nher intellectual capacity, than by the augmentation of her physical\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\"Neither is it attained by the increase or refinement of her love for\r\nMan, or for any object whatever, or for all objects collectively; but\r\n\r\n\"This state of being is attained by the reference of all her powers\r\nand all her actions to the source of Universal Love, whose constant\r\nrequisition is a pure, chaste and holy life.\r\n\r\n\"So long as Woman looks to Man (or to society) for that which she\r\nneeds, she will remain in an indigent state, for he himself is\r\nindigent of it, and as much needs it as she does.\r\n\r\n\"So long as this indigence continues, all unions or relations\r\nconstructed between Man and Woman are constructed in indigence, and\r\ncan produce only indigent results or unhappy consequences.\r\n\r\n\"The unions now constructing, as well as those in which the parties\r\nconstructing them were generated, being based on self-delight, or\r\nlust, can lead to no more happiness in the twentieth than is found in\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\"It is not amended institutions, it is not improved education, it is\r\nnot another selection of individuals for union, that can meliorate the\r\nsaid result, but the _basis_ of the union must be changed.\r\n\r\n\"If in the natural order Woman and Man would adhere strictly to\r\nphysiological or natural laws, in physical chastity, a most beautiful\r\namendment of the human race, and human condition, would in a few\r\ngenerations adorn the world.\r\n\r\n\"Still, it belongs to Woman in the spiritual order, to devote herself\r\nwholly to her eternal husband, and become the Free Bride of the One\r\nwho alone can elevate her to her true position, and reconstruct her a\r\npure, chaste, and holy being.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nF.\r\n\r\nI have mislaid an extract from \"The Memoirs of an American Lady,\"\r\nwhich I wished to use on this subject, but its import is, briefly,\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nObserving of how little consequence the Indian women are in youth, and\r\nhow much in age, because in that trying life, good counsel and\r\nsagacity are more prized than charms, Mrs. Grant expresses a wish that\r\nreformers would take a hint from observation of this circumstance.\r\n\r\nIn another place she says: \"The misfortune of our sex is, that young\r\nwomen are not regarded as the material from which old women must be\r\nmade.\"\r\n\r\nI quote from memory, but believe the weight of the remark is retained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nG.\r\n\r\nEURIPIDES.  SOPHOCLES.\r\n\r\nAs many allusions are made in the foregoing pages to characters of\r\nwomen drawn by the Greek dramatists, which may not be familiar to the\r\nmajority of readers, I have borrowed from the papers of Miranda some\r\nnotes upon them. I trust the girlish tone of apostrophising rapture\r\nmay be excused. Miranda was very young at the time of writing,\r\ncompared with her present mental age. _Now_, she would express\r\nthe same feelings, but in a worthier garb--if she expressed them at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nIphigenia! Antigone! you were worthy to live! _We_ are fallen on\r\nevil times, my sisters; our feelings have been checked; our thoughts\r\nquestioned; our forms dwarfed and defaced by a bad nurture. Yet hearts\r\nlike yours are in our breasts, living, if unawakened; and our minds\r\nare capable of the same resolves. You we understand at once; those who\r\nstare upon us pertly in the street, we cannot--could never understand.\r\n\r\nYou knew heroes, maidens, and your fathers were kings of men. You\r\nbelieved in your country and the gods of your country. A great\r\noccasion was given to each, whereby to test her character.\r\n\r\nYou did not love on earth; for the poets wished to show us the force\r\nof Woman's nature, virgin and unbiased. You were women; not wives, or\r\nlovers, or mothers. Those are great names, but we are glad to see\r\n_you_ in untouched flower.\r\n\r\nWere brothers so dear, then, Antigone? We have no brothers. We see no\r\nmen into whose lives we dare look steadfastly, or to whose destinies\r\nwe look forward confidently. We care not for their urns; what\r\ninscription could we put upon them? They live for petty successes, or\r\nto win daily the bread of the day. No spark of kingly fire flashes\r\nfrom their eyes.\r\n\r\nNone! are there _none_?\r\n\r\nIt is a base speech to say it. Yes! there are some such; we have\r\nsometimes caught their glances. But rarely have they been rocked in\r\nthe same cradle as we, and they do not look upon us much; for the time\r\nis not yet come.\r\n\r\nThou art so grand and simple! we need not follow thee; thou dost not\r\nneed our love.\r\n\r\nBut, sweetest Iphigenia! who knew _thee_, as to me thou art\r\nknown? I was not born in vain, if only for the heavenly tears I have\r\nshed with thee. She will be grateful for them. I have understood her\r\nwholly, as a friend should; better than she understood herself.\r\n\r\nWith what artless art the narrative rises to the crisis! The conflicts\r\nin Agamemnon's mind, and the imputations of Menelaus, give us, at\r\nonce, the full image of him, strong in will and pride, weak in virtue,\r\nweak in the noble powers of the mind that depend on imagination. He\r\nsuffers, yet it requires the presence of his daughter to make him feel\r\nthe full horror of what he is to do.\r\n\r\n  \"Ah me! that breast, those cheeks, those golden tresses!\"\r\n\r\nIt is her beauty, not her misery, that makes the pathos. This is\r\nnoble. And then, too, the injustice of the gods, that she, this\r\ncreature of unblemished loveliness, must perish for the sake of a\r\nworthless woman. Even Menelaus feels it the moment he recovers from\r\nhis wrath.\r\n\r\n  \"What hath she to do,\r\n  The virgin daughter, with my Helena!\r\n  * * Its former reasonings now\r\n  My soul foregoes. * * * *\r\n                    For it is not just\r\n  That thou shouldst groan, while my affairs go pleasantly,\r\n  That those of thy house should die, and mine see the light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, the overwhelmed aspect of the king of men might well move him.\r\n\r\n  \"_Men_. Brother, give me to take thy right hand.\r\n\r\n  _Aga_. I give it, _for_ the victory is thine, and I am wretched.\r\n  I am, indeed, ashamed to drop the tear,\r\n  And not to drop the tear I am ashamed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow beautifully is Iphigenia introduced; beaming more and more softly\r\non us with every touch of description! After Clytemnestra has given\r\nOrestes (then an infant) out of the chariot, she says:\r\n\r\n              \"Ye females, in your arms\r\n  Receive her, for she is of tender age.\r\n  Sit here by my feet, my child,\r\n  By thy mother, Iphigenia, and show\r\n  These strangers how I am blessed in thee,\r\n  And here address thee to thy father.\r\n\r\n  _Iphi_. O, mother! should I run, wouldst thou be angry?\r\n  And embrace my father heart to heart?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the same sweet, timid trust she prefers the request to himself,\r\nand, as he holds her in his arms, he seems as noble as Guido's\r\nArchangel; as if he never could sink below the trust of such a being!\r\n\r\nThe Achilles, in the first scene, is fine. A true Greek hero; not too\r\ngood; all flushed with the pride of youth, but capable of godlike\r\nimpulses. At first, he thinks only of his own wounded pride (when he\r\nfinds Iphigenia has been decoyed to Aulis under the pretest of\r\nbecoming his wife); but the grief of the queen soon makes him superior\r\nto his arrogant chafings. How well he says,\r\n\r\n  \"_Far as a young man may_, I will repress\r\n  So great a wrong!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy seeing him here, we understand why he, not Hector, was the hero of\r\nthe Iliad. The beautiful moral nature of Hector was early developed by\r\nclose domestic ties, and the cause of his country. Except in a purer\r\nsimplicity of speech and manner, he might be a modern and a Christian.\r\nBut Achilles is cast in the largest and most vigorous mould of the\r\nearlier day. His nature is one of the richest capabilities, and\r\ntherefore less quickly unfolds its meaning. The impression it makes at\r\nthe early period is only of power and pride; running as fleetly with\r\nhis armor on as with it off; but sparks of pure lustre are struck, at\r\nmoments, from the mass of ore. Of this sort is his refusal to see the\r\nbeautiful virgin he has promised to protect. None of the Grecians must\r\nhave the right to doubt his motives, How wise and prudent, too, the\r\nadvice he gives as to the queen's conduct! He will cot show himself\r\nunless needed. His pride is the farthest possible remote from vanity.\r\nHis thoughts are as free as any in our own time.\r\n\r\n  \"The prophet? what is he? a man\r\n  Who speaks, 'mong many falsehoods, but few truths,\r\n  Whene'er chance leads him to speak true; when false,\r\n  The prophet is no more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHad Agamemnon possessed like clearness of sight, the virgin would not\r\nhave perished, but Greece would have had no religion and no national\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the interview with Agamemnon, the queen begins her speech, in\r\nthe true matrimonial style, dignified though her gesture be, and true\r\nall she says, we feel that truth, thus sauced with taunts, will not\r\ntouch his heart, nor turn him from his purpose. But when Iphigenia,\r\nbegins her exquisite speech, as with the breathings of a lute,--\r\n\r\n  \"Had I, my father, the persuasive voice\r\n   Of Orpheus, &c.\r\n                             Compel me not\r\n   What is beneath to view. I was the first\r\n   To call thee father; me thou first didst call\r\n   Thy child. I was the first that on thy knees\r\n   Fondly caressed thee, and from thee received\r\n   The fond caress. This was thy speech to me:--\r\n   'Shall I, my child, e'er see thee in some house\r\n   Of splendor, happy in thy husband, live\r\n   And flourish, as becomes my dignity?'\r\n   My speech to thee was, leaning 'gainst thy cheek,\r\n   (Which with my hand I now caress): 'And what\r\n   Shall I then do for thee? Shall I receive\r\n   My father when grown old, and in my house\r\n   Cheer him with each fond office, to repay\r\n   The careful nurture which he gave my youth?'\r\n   These words are in my memory deep impressed;\r\n   Thou hast forgot them, and will kill thy child.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThen she adjures him by all the sacred ties, and dwells pathetically\r\non the circumstance which had struck even Menelaus.\r\n\r\n  \"If Paris be enamored of his bride,\r\n   His Helen,--what concerns it me? and how\r\n   Comes he to my destruction?\r\n                           Look upon me;\r\n   Give me a smile, give me a kiss, my father;\r\n   That, if my words persuade thee not, in death\r\n   I may have this memorial of thy love.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNever have the names of father and daughter been uttered with a holier\r\ntenderness than by Euripides, as in this most lovely passage, or in\r\nthe \"Supplicants,\" after the voluntary death of Evadne. Iphis says:\r\n\r\n  \"What shall this wretch now do?  Should I return\r\n   To my own house?--sad desolation there\r\n   I shall behold, to sink my soul with grief.\r\n   Or go I to the house of Capaneus?\r\n   That was delightful to me, when I found\r\n   My daughter there; but she is there no more.\r\n   Oft would she kiss my check, with fond caress\r\n   Oft soothe me. To a father, waxing old,\r\n   Nothing is dearer than a daughter! Sons\r\n   Have spirits of higher pitch, but less inclined\r\n   To sweet, endearing fondness. Lead me then,\r\n   Instantly lead me to my house; consign\r\n   My wretched age to darkness, there to pine\r\n   And waste away.\r\n                    Old age,\r\n  Struggling with many griefs, O, how I hate thee!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to return to Iphigenia,--how infinitely melting is her appeal to\r\nOrestes, whom she holds in her robe!\r\n\r\n  \"My brother, small assistance canst thou give\r\n   Thy friends; yet for thy sister with thy tears\r\n   Implore thy father that she may not die.\r\n   Even infants have a sense of ills; and see,\r\n   My father! silent though he be, he sues\r\n   To thee. Be gentle to me; on my life\r\n   Have pity. Thy two children by this beard\r\n   Entreat thee, thy dear children; one is yet\r\n   An infant, one to riper years arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mention of Orestes, then an infant, though slight, is of a\r\ndomestic charm that prepares the mind to feel the tragedy of his after\r\nlot. When the queen says,\r\n\r\n                    \"Dost thou sleep,\r\n  My son? The rolling chariot hath subdued thee;\r\n  Wake to thy sister's marriage happily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwe understand the horror of the doom which makes this cherished child\r\na parricide. And so, when Iphigenia takes leave of him after her fate\r\nis by herself accepted,--\r\n\r\n  \"_Iphi_. To manhood train Orestes.\r\n  _Cly_.  Embrace him, for thou ne'er shalt see him more.\r\n  _Iphi_. (_To Orestes_.) Far as thou couldst, thou\r\n    didst assist thy friends,\"--\r\n\r\n\r\nwe know not how to blame the guilt of the maddened wife and mother. In\r\nher last meeting with Agamemnon, as in her previous expostulations and\r\nanguish, we see that a straw may turn the balance, and make her his\r\ndeadliest foe. Just then, came the suit of Aegisthus,--then, when\r\nevery feeling was uprooted or lacerated in her heart.\r\n\r\nIphigenia's moving address has no further effect than to make her\r\nfather turn at bay and brave this terrible crisis. He goes out, firm\r\nin resolve; and she and her mother abandon themselves to a natural\r\ngrief.\r\n\r\nHitherto nothing has been seen in Iphigenia, except the young girl,\r\nweak, delicate, full of feeling, and beautiful as a sunbeam on the\r\nfull, green tree. But, in the next scene, the first impulse of that\r\npassion which makes and unmakes us, though unconfessed even to\r\nherself, though hopeless and unreturned, raises her at once into the\r\nheroic woman, worthy of the goddess who demands her.\r\n\r\nAchilles appears to defend her, whom all others clamorously seek to\r\ndeliver to the murderous knife. She sees him, and, fired with thoughts\r\nunknown before, devotes herself at once for the country which has\r\ngiven birth to such a man.\r\n\r\n                 \"To be too fond of life\r\n  Becomes not me; nor for myself alone,\r\n  But to all Greece, a blessing didst thou bear me.\r\n  Shall thousands, when their country's injured, lift\r\n  Their shields? shall thousands grasp the oar and dare,\r\n  Advancing bravely 'gainst the foe, to die\r\n  For Greece? And shall my life, my single life,\r\n  Obstruct all this? Would this be just? What word\r\n  Can we reply? Nay more, it is not right\r\n  That he with all the Grecians should contest\r\n  In fight, should die, _and for a woman_. No!\r\n  More than a thousand women is one man\r\n  Worthy to see the light of day.\r\n  * * *         for Greece I give my life.\r\n  Slay me! demolish Troy! for these shall be\r\n  Long time my monuments, my children these,\r\n  My nuptials and my glory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sentiment marks Woman, when she loves enough to feel what a\r\ncreature of glory and beauty a true _Man_ would be, as much in\r\nour own time as that of Euripides. Cooper makes the weak Hetty say to\r\nher beautiful sister:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I don't compare you with Harry. A handsome man is always\r\nfar handsomer than any woman.\" True, it was the sentiment of the age,\r\nbut it was the first time Iphigenia had felt it. In Agamemnon she saw\r\n_her father_; to him she could prefer her claim. In Achilles she\r\nsaw a _Man_, the crown of creation, enough to fill the world with\r\nhis presence, were all other beings blotted from its spaces.\r\n[Footnote: Men do not often reciprocate this pure love.\r\n\r\n  \"Her prentice han' she tried on man,\r\n   And then she made the lasses o',\"\r\n\r\nis a fancy, not a feeling, in their more frequently passionate and\r\nstrong than noble or tender natures.]\r\n\r\nThe reply of Achilles is as noble. Here is his bride; he feels it now,\r\nand all his vain vaunting are hushed.\r\n\r\n  \"Daughter of Agamemnon, highly blest\r\n   Some god would make me, if I might attain\r\n   Thy nuptials. Greece in thee I happy deem,\r\n   And thee in Greece.\r\n                 * * * in thy thought\r\n   Revolve this well; death is a dreadful thing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow sweet it her reply,--and then the tender modesty with which she\r\naddresses him here and elsewhere as \"_stranger_\"\r\n\r\n      \"Reflecting not on any, thus I speak:\r\n       Enough of wars and slaughters from the charms\r\n       Of Helen rise; but die not thou for me,\r\n       O Stranger, nor distain thy sword with blood,\r\n       But let me save my country if I may.\r\n\r\n   _Achilles_. O glorious spirit! naught have I 'gainst this\r\n       To urge, since such thy will, for what thou sayst\r\n       Is generous. Why should not the truth be spoken?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut feeling that human weakness may conquer yet, he goes to wait at\r\nthe alter, resolved to keep his promise of protection thoroughly.\r\n\r\nIn the next beautiful scene she shows that a few tears might overwhelm\r\nher in his absence. She raises her mother beyond weeping them, yet her\r\nsoft purity she cannot impart.\r\n\r\n  \"_Iphi_. My father, and my husband do not hate;\r\n   _Cly_. For thy dear sake fierce contest must he bear.\r\n   _Iphi_. For Greece reluctant me to death he yields;\r\n   _Cly_. Basely, with guile unworthy Atreus' son.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is truth incapable of an answer, and Iphigenia attempts none.\r\n\r\nShe begins the hymn which is to sustain her:\r\n\r\n  \"Lead me; mine the glorious fate,\r\n   To o'erturn the Phrygian state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the sublime flow of lyric heroism, she suddenly sinks back into\r\nthe tenderer feeling of her dreadful fate.\r\n\r\n  \"O my country, where these eyes\r\n   Opened on Pelasgic skies!\r\n   O ye virgins, once my pride,\r\n   In Mycenae who abide!\r\n\r\n  CHORUS.\r\n\r\n   Why of Perseus, name the town,\r\n   Which Cyclopean ramparts crown?\r\n\r\n  IPHIGENIA\r\n\r\n   Me you reared a beam of light,\r\n   Freely now I sink in night.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Freely_; as the messenger afterwards recounts it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  \"Imperial Agamemnon, when he saw\r\n   His daughter, as a victim to the grave,\r\n   Advancing, groaned, and, bursting into tears,\r\n   Turned from the sight his head, before his eyes,\r\n   Holding his robe. The virgin near him stood,\r\n   And thus addressed him: 'Father, I to thee\r\n   Am present; for my country, and for all\r\n   The land of Greece, I freely give myself\r\n   A victim: to the altar let them lead me,\r\n   Since such the oracle. If aught on me\r\n   Depends, be happy, and obtain the prize\r\n   Of glorious conquest, and revisit safe\r\n   Your country. Of the Grecians, for this cause,\r\n   Let no one touch me; with intrepid spirit\r\n   Silent will I present my neck.' She spoke,\r\n   And all that heard revered the noble soul\r\n   And virtue of the virgin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow quickly had the fair bud bloomed up into its perfection! Had she\r\nlived a thousand years, she could not have surpassed this. Goethe's\r\nIphigenia, the mature Woman, with its myriad delicate traits, never\r\nsurpasses, scarcely equals, what we know of her in Euripides.\r\n\r\nCan I appreciate this work in a translation? I think so, impossible as\r\nit may seem to one who can enjoy the thousand melodies, and words in\r\nexactly the right place, and cadence of the original. They say you can\r\nsee the Apollo Belvidere in a plaster cast, and I cannot doubt it, so\r\ngreat the benefit conferred on my mind by a transcript thus imperfect.\r\nAnd so with these translations from the Greek. I can divine the\r\noriginal through this veil, as I can see the movements of a spirited\r\nhorse by those of his coarse grasscloth muffler. Besides, every\r\ntranslator who feels his subject is inspired, and the divine Aura\r\ninforms even his stammering lips.\r\n\r\nIphigenia is more like one of the women Shakspeare loved than the\r\nothers; she is a tender virgin, ennobled and strengthened by sentiment\r\nmore than intellect; what they call a Woman _par excellence_.\r\n\r\nMacaria is more like one of Massinger's women. She advances boldly,\r\nthough with the decorum of her sex and nation:\r\n\r\n  \"_Macaria_. Impute not boldness to me that I come\r\n      Before you, strangers; this my first request\r\n      I urge; for silence and a chaste reserve\r\n      Is Woman's genuine praise, and to remain\r\n      Quiet within the house. But I come forth,\r\n      Hearing thy lamentations, Iolaus;\r\n      Though charged with no commission, yet perhaps\r\n      I may be useful.\" * *\r\n\r\n\r\nHer speech when she offers herself as the victim is reasonable, as one\r\nmight speak to-day. She counts the cost all through. Iphigenia is too\r\ntimid and delicate to dwell upon the loss of earthly bliss and the due\r\nexperience of life, even as much as Jephtha'a daughter did; but\r\nMacaria is explicit, as well befits the daughter of Hercules.\r\n\r\n              \"Should _these_ die, myself\r\n  Preserved, of prosperous future could I form\r\n  One cheerful hope?\r\n  A poor forsaken virgin who would deign\r\n  To take in marriage? Who would wish for sons\r\n  From one so wretched? Better then to die,\r\n  Than bear such undeserved miseries;\r\n  One less illustrious this might more beseem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  I have a soul that unreluctantly\r\n  Presents itself, and I proclaim aloud\r\n  That for my brothers and myself I die.\r\n  I am not fond of life, but think I gain\r\n  An honorable prize to die with glory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nStill nobler when Iolaus proposes rather that she shall draw lots with\r\nher sisters.\r\n\r\n  \"By _lot_ I will not die, for to such death\r\n   No thanks are due, or glory--name it not.\r\n   If you accept me, if my offered life\r\n   Be grateful to you, willingly I give it\r\n   For these; but by constraint I will not die.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVery fine are her parting advice and injunctions to them all:\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell! revered old man, farewell! and teach\r\n   These youths in all things to be wise, like thee,\r\n   Naught will avail them more.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMacaria has the clear Minerva eye; Antigone's is deeper and more\r\ncapable of emotion, but calm; Iphigenia's glistening, gleaming with\r\nangel truth, or dewy as a hidden violet.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that Tennyson, who spoke with such fitness of all the\r\nothers in his \"Dream of fair Women,\" has not of Iphigenia. Of her\r\nalone he has not made a fit picture, but only of the circumstances of\r\nthe sacrifice. He can never have taken to heart this work of\r\nEuripides, yet he was so worthy to feel it. Of Jephtha's daughter he\r\nhas spoken as he would of Iphigenia, both in her beautiful song, and\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n  \"I heard Him, for He spake, and grief became\r\n     A solemn scorn of Ills.\r\n\r\n   It comforts me in this one thought to dwell--\r\n     That I subdued me to my father's will;\r\n   Because the kiss he gave me, ere I fell,\r\n     Sweetens the spirit still.\r\n\r\n   Moreover it is written, that my race\r\n     Hewed Ammon, hip and thigh, from Arroer\r\n   Or Arnon unto Minneth.  Here her face\r\n     Glowed as I looked on her.\r\n\r\n   She looked her lips;  she left me where I stood;\r\n     'Glory to God,' she sang, and past afar,\r\n   Thridding the sombre boskage of the woods,\r\n     Toward the morning-star.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the \"Trojan dames\" there are fine touches of nature with regard to\r\nCassandra. Hecuba shows that mixture of shame and reverence that prose\r\nkindred always do, towards the inspired child, the poet, the elected\r\nsufferer for the race.\r\n\r\nWhen the herald announces that she is chosen to be the mistress of\r\nAgamemnon, Hecuba answers indignant, and betraying the involuntary\r\npride and faith she felt in this daughter.\r\n\r\n      \"The virgin of Apollo, whom the God,\r\n       Radiant with golden looks, allowed to live.\r\n       In her pure vow of maiden chastity?\r\n  _Tal_. With love the raptured virgin smote his heart.\r\n  _Hec_. Cast from thee, O my daughter, cast away\r\n      Thy sacred wand; rend off the honored wreaths,\r\n      The splendid ornaments that grace thy brows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the moment Cassandra appears, singing wildly her inspired song,\r\nHecuba, calls her\r\n\r\n  \"My _frantic_ child.\"\r\n\r\nYet how graceful she is in her tragic phrenzy, the chorus shows--\r\n\r\n  \"How sweetly at thy house's ills thou smilest,\r\n   Chanting what haply thou wilt not show true!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if Hecuba dares not trust her highest instinct about her daughter,\r\nstill less can the vulgar mind of the herald (a man not without\r\ntenderness of heart, but with no princely, no poetic blood) abide the\r\nwild, prophetic mood which insults his prejudices both as to country\r\nand decorums of the sex. Yet Agamemnon, though not a noble man, is of\r\nlarge mould, and could admire this strange beauty which excited\r\ndistaste in common minds.\r\n\r\n  \"_Tal_. What commands respect, and is held high\r\n      As wise, is nothing better than the mean\r\n      Of no repute; for this most potent king\r\n      Of all the Grecians, the much-honored son\r\n      Of Atreus, is enamored with his prize,\r\n      This frantic raver. I am a poor man,\r\n      Yet would I not receive her to my bed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCassandra answers, with a careless disdain,\r\n\r\n  \"This is a busy slave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith all the lofty decorum of manners among the ancients, how free was\r\ntheir intercourse, man to man, how full the mutual understanding\r\nbetween prince and \"busy slave!\" Not here in adversity only, but in\r\nthe pomp of power it was so. Kings were approached with ceremonious\r\nobeisance, but not hedged round with etiquette; they could see and\r\nknow their fellows.\r\n\r\nThe Andromache here is just as lovely as that of the Iliad.\r\n\r\nTo her child whom they are about to murder, the same that was\r\nfrightened at the \"glittering plume,\" she says,\r\n\r\n                     \"Dost thou weep,\r\n  My son? Hast thou a sense of thy ill fate?\r\n  Why dost thou clasp me with thy hands, why hold\r\n  My robes, and shelter thee beneath my wings,\r\n  Like a young bird?  No more my Hector comes,\r\n  Returning from the tomb; he grasps no more\r\n  His glittering spear, bringing protection to thee.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  * * \"O, soft embrace,\r\n  And to thy mother dear. O, fragrant breath!\r\n  In vain I swathed thy infant limbs, in vain\r\n  I gave thee nurture at this breast, and tolled,\r\n  Wasted with care. _If ever_, now embrace,\r\n  Now clasp thy mother; throw thine arms around\r\n  My neck, and join thy cheek, thy lips to mine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I look up, I meet the eyes of Beatrice Cenci, Beautiful one! these\r\nwoes, even, were less than thine, yet thou seemest to understand them\r\nall. Thy clear, melancholy gaze says, they, at least, had known\r\nmoments of bliss, and the tender relations of nature had not been\r\nbroken and polluted from the very first. Yes! the gradations of woe\r\nare all but infinite: only good can be infinite.\r\n\r\nCertainly the Greeks knew more of real home intercourse and more of\r\nWoman than the Americans. It is in vain to tell me of outward\r\nobservances. The poets, the sculptors, always tell the truth. In\r\nproportion as a nation is refined, women _must_ have an ascendency.\r\nIt is the law of nature.\r\n\r\nBeatrice! thou wert not \"fond of life,\" either, more than those\r\nprincesses. Thou wert able to cut it down in the full flower of\r\nbeauty, as an offering to _the best_ known to thee. Thou wert not\r\nso happy as to die for thy country or thy brethren, but thou wert\r\nworthy of such an occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the days of chivalry, Woman was habitually viewed more as an ideal;\r\nbut I do not know that she inspired a deeper and more home-felt\r\nreverence than Iphigenia in the breast of Achilles, or Macarla in that\r\nof her old guardian, Iolaus.\r\n\r\nWe may, with satisfaction, add to these notes the words to which Haydn\r\nhas adapted his magnificent music in \"The Creation.\"\r\n\r\n\"In native worth and honor clad, with beauty, courage, strength\r\nadorned, erect to heaven, and tall, he stands, a Man!--the lord and\r\nking of all! The large and arched front sublime of wisdom deep\r\ndeclares the seat, and in his eyes with brightness shines the soul,\r\nthe breath and image of his God. With fondness leans upon his breast\r\nthe partner for him formed,--a woman fair, and graceful spouse. Her\r\nsoftly smiling virgin looks, of flowery spring the mirror, bespeak him\r\nlove, and joy and bliss.\"\r\n\r\nWhoever has heard this music must have a mental standard as to what\r\nMan and Woman should be. Such was marriage in Eden when \"erect to\r\nheaven _he_ stood;\" but since, like other institutions, this must\r\nbe not only reformed, but revived, the following lines may be offered\r\nas a picture of something intermediate,--the seed of the future\r\ngrowth:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH.\r\n\r\nTHE SACRED MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n  And has another's life as large a scope?\r\n  It may give due fulfilment to thy hope,\r\n  And every portal to the unknown may ope.\r\n\r\n  If, near this other life, thy inmost feeling\r\n  Trembles with fateful prescience of revealing\r\n  The future Deity, time is still concealing;\r\n\r\n  If thou feel thy whole force drawn more and more\r\n  To launch that other bark on seas without a shore;\r\n  And no still secret must be kept in store;\r\n\r\n  If meannesses that dim each temporal deed,\r\n  The dull decay that mars the fleshly weed,\r\n  And flower of love that seems to fall and leave no seed--\r\n\r\n  Hide never the full presence from thy sight\r\n  Of mutual aims and tasks, ideals bright,\r\n  Which feed their roots to-day on all this seeming blight.\r\n\r\n  Twin stars that mutual circle in the heaven,\r\n  Two parts for spiritual concord given,\r\n  Twin Sabbaths that inlock the Sacred Seven;\r\n\r\n  Still looking to the centre for the cause,\r\n  Mutual light giving to draw out the powers,\r\n  And learning all the other groups by cognizance of one another's laws.\r\n\r\n  The parent love the wedded love includes;\r\n  The one permits the two their mutual moods;\r\n  The two each other know, 'mid myriad multitudes;\r\n\r\n  With child-like intellect discerning love,\r\n  And mutual action energising love,\r\n  In myriad forms affiliating love.\r\n\r\n  A world whose seasons bloom from pole to pole,\r\n  A force which knows both starting-point and goal,\r\n  A Home in Heaven,--the Union in the Soul.",
