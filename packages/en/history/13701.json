The Audiencia is suppressed, and in\r\nits place is sent a royal governor; the instructions given to him\r\nembody many of the reforms demanded by the people through their\r\nenvoy Sánchez. Extensive and dangerous conspiracies among the natives\r\nagainst the Spaniards are discovered, and severely punished. Trade\r\nbetween Nueva España and China is beginning, and seems to menace the\r\nwelfare of the Philippine colony. A large immigration of Chinese to\r\nthe islands has set in, and is already seriously affecting economic\r\ninterests there. The city of Manila, recently destroyed by fire, is\r\nbeing rebuilt, this time mainly with brick and stone. As usual, there\r\nis much friction between the ecclesiastical and secular authorities,\r\nlargely concerning the collection of tributes from the Indians;\r\nthe most prominent figure in these contentions is the aged but fiery\r\nbishop, Salazar.\r\n\r\nShortly after the Jesuit Sánchez had gone to Spain as envoy of the\r\nPhilippine colonists, a document was prepared (December 31, 1586),\r\nby order of the Manila cabildo, to be sent to him for use at the\r\nSpanish court. As this was lost on the \"Santa Ana,\" and as Bishop\r\nSalazar regards the supply of missionaries in the islands as very\r\ninadequate, he applies (June 3, 1588) to the cabildo for another copy\r\nof such part of this document as relates to the religious needs of the\r\nnatives. This he sends (June 25) to the royal Council of the Indias,\r\nwith considerable additions regarding certain islands not mentioned\r\nin the cabildo's memorial. This document gives much interesting\r\ninformation, not only on religious matters, but on the social and\r\neconomic conditions of both Spaniards and natives in the islands. In\r\neach island or province are enumerated the population, both native\r\nand Spanish; the number of Spanish troops, also of encomiendas and\r\ntributarios; the number of convents and their inmates; the religious\r\nand ecclesiastics, not only those resident, but those needed among\r\nthe natives; the officials employed by the government; the Chinese\r\nimmigrants and their occupations; the articles for sale in the public\r\nmarket; and the imports and exports at Manila. The writer relates many\r\nthings of interest regarding the natural resources and products of the\r\ncountry, the mode of life of both Spaniards and natives, the means of\r\ndefense possessed by the colony, the Indians who are not as yet under\r\nSpanish rule. All this affords a valuable and curiously interesting\r\npicture of the colony and its life; but Salazar, in presenting it,\r\nis mainly concerned with the great need of more religious instruction\r\nfor the natives, and earnestly entreats the king to send more friars\r\nand ecclesiastics for the purpose.\r\n\r\nA letter from Santiago de Vera to the king (dated June 26, 1588)\r\ngives his report for the past year. He recounts the exploits of the\r\nEnglish adventurer Candish against Spanish commerce. Hereafter the\r\nships which carry goods from the Philippines will be armed with cannon\r\nand other means of defense. Vera asks for more artillery with which\r\nto defend the islands, which are menaced by great dangers in their\r\npresent weak condition. He has built some galleys, but would prefer\r\nsome light ships for navigation among the islands. The new fort at\r\nManila is described; it will, when completed, be sufficient defense\r\nfor the city. The governor also enumerates the artillery which he\r\nhas, and asks that more be provided by the home government. He has\r\npunished the royal officials for engaging in trade. Vera advises\r\nthat the sale of certain public offices be deferred for some years,\r\nuntil the colony shall be more prosperous.\r\n\r\nOn the next day (June 27) Salazar writes to the king. He defends\r\nhimself against the royal reprimand for his dissensions with the\r\nAudiencia. Further information is given regarding the capture of\r\nSpanish ships by Candish. The resulting losses of citizens in the\r\nislands are very great, and still more serious is the loss of Spanish\r\nprestige in the archipelago. In Mindanao, Moslem missionaries are\r\nconducting an extensive propaganda. The bishop complains that in\r\nhis diocese the churches, as well as their furniture, are often so\r\nwretched and inadequate that they are a disgrace to religion, and are\r\n\"not fit to be entered by horses.\" This arises from the penuriousness\r\nor the poverty of the encomenderos; nothing can be expected from\r\nthe natives, who are \"so harassed and afflicted with public and\r\nprivate undertakings that they are not able to take breath.\" The\r\nbishop regards the calamities that have befallen the Spaniards as\r\npunishments inflicted on them by God for their evil treatment of the\r\nIndians. He recommends that many religious be sent to the islands,\r\nwho will be protectors of the natives; also that a governor be sent\r\nwho is not ruled by selfish or family interests. Salazar complains\r\nof the harshness and severity shown by the viceroy of Nueva España,\r\nespecially as the latter will not allow certain Dominican friars to go\r\nto the Philippines; and as he has injured the commerce of the islands\r\nby his restrictive measures--especially by selling the vessel \"Saint\r\nMartin\" to a Mexican merchant to be used in the Chinese trade. The\r\nwreck of that ship at sea he regards as a punishment from heaven. He\r\nurges that trade from Mexico to China be stopped, and that the viceroy\r\nof Nueva España be ordered to send aid to the Philippines, especially\r\nof troops and military supplies, and not to meddle with the decisions\r\nof the Audiencia there regarding customs duties, etc. Salazar objects\r\nto the presence of so many Chinamen in the islands.\r\n\r\nAn extract from a letter of the viceroy of India to the king (April 3,\r\n1589) complains that some of his officers have violated the prohibition\r\nof intercourse with China and the Philippines. He has sent officials\r\nto Macao to quell disturbances there, and order has been given that\r\nall Castilians there shall be sent away. He is greatly opposed to\r\nthe trade which has begun between Mexico and China, and thinks that\r\nrigorous measures should be taken against it.\r\n\r\nVera writes (July 13) to the king imploring reenforcements and\r\nsupplies for the islands. Three Spaniards, among them a Franciscan\r\nfriar, have been treacherously slain by the Borneans. This proves to\r\nbe the outcome of a general conspiracy among the Filipinos, Borneans,\r\nand other peoples to attack and drive out the Spaniards. The plotters\r\nare detected and severely punished. Certain public offices have been\r\nsold, account for which is rendered by the governor. He is endeavoring\r\nto secure a small fleet of trading ships, but is obliged to ask\r\naid for this from the royal treasury. Not only ships, but sailors\r\nand carpenters are needed, who should be paid in the same way. More\r\nartillery is needed, also to be furnished by royal aid. The Chinese\r\ntrade is continually increasing. The city of Manila is being fast\r\nrebuilt, and in stone. But the land is unhealthful and the soldiers\r\ndie fast, so that the islands have few men for their defense; and\r\nagain the king is earnestly entreated to order that men and supplies\r\nbe sent at once from Nueva España. The new fort has been injured by\r\nearthquakes, but Vera is building it more strongly. He complains that\r\nthe friars have neglected his commands to learn the Chinese language\r\nand instruct the Chinese who live on the islands. The Dominicans alone\r\nhave entered this field; they have achieved great results, and have\r\nnow among the Chinese \"a village of Christians.\" Many more would be\r\nconverted, if it were not for the bishop's order that the long hair\r\nof the converts should be cut off; accordingly the king orders that\r\na conference of religious and learned persons be held, who shall\r\ntake suitable action in regard to this and other matters concerning\r\nthe conversion of the Chinese. Vera complains of the arrogance,\r\nobstinacy, and high temper of the bishop, and asks that the king\r\nrestrain him. There is no physician in Manila, and one is urgently\r\nneeded in the royal hospital. This document is followed by the notarial\r\nrecord of proceedings in the trial of various Indians for conspiracy,\r\nwhich is mentioned in Vera's letter. The punishments inflicted upon\r\nthem are specified: in each case, appeal was made to the Audiencia,\r\nwhich in some cases modified the penalty, but otherwise affirmed the\r\nformer decision.\r\n\r\nGaspar de Ayala, royal fiscal in the islands, makes his report to\r\nthe king (July 15). He advises that ships for the royal service be\r\nbuilt in the islands; also that the gold used as currency there be\r\nexchanged in Nueva España for Spanish coin--both of which measures\r\nwill be of profit to the royal treasury. He renders account of the\r\nrecent sale of offices in the islands, and gives advice regarding\r\nthis method of aiding the royal exchequer. Certain encomiendas\r\nbecoming vacant, Ayala, as fiscal, undertakes to secure them for\r\nthe crown; in this he has difficulties with the governor, who also\r\nis trying to make trouble for Ayala with the soldiers. The latter\r\nasks to be relieved from his post in the Philippines, and sent to\r\nsome other. The Chinese trade is meager this year, owing to war and\r\npestilence in China; and there are rumors that it is being diverted\r\nto Peru or Nueva España. If this be true, the Philippine colony will\r\nbe ruined. A second plot against the Spaniards has been revealed,\r\nthis time in Cebú; but the leaders have been captured. The Indians\r\nof Cagayán have also revolted, and troops have been sent against\r\nthem. Ayala adds, \"I am ready to certify that there are few places\r\nin these islands where the natives are not disaffected.\" The Spanish\r\ncolony is in great danger, and imperatively needs reenforcements to\r\nsave it from destruction. The galleys at Manila, now useless, should\r\nbe replaced by light sailing-vessels. A further levy of tribute has\r\nbeen made on the Indians for the new fortress at Manila: this is an\r\noppressive burden for them. Ayala relates at length the dissensions\r\nbetween the bishop and the secular authorities; the king is implored\r\nto settle the question at issue. The bishop has also offended the\r\nAugustinians, by sending Dominican friars into their field among the\r\nChinese residents: The king is asked to send more friars, to instruct\r\nthe natives. The Manila hospital for Indians has no income save of\r\nalms: Ayala recommends that the Franciscans in charge be allowed to\r\nsell a certain amount of pepper in Nueva España. The members of the\r\nAudiencia, and the magistrates and officials appointed during the\r\ncurrent year are enumerated by name. A fierce tempest has occurred\r\nat Manila, causing great damage, and destroying all the vessels in\r\nthe harbor except one small one. The expedition sent to Cagayán has\r\nreturned without accomplishing anything except the destruction of the\r\ncrops belonging to the hostile Indians, which will only irritate them\r\nand incite them to revenge.\r\n\r\nA royal decree (dated August 9, 1589) orders the newly appointed\r\ngovernor of the Philippines, Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, to repeal the\r\nimport duties levied at Manila on provisions and military supplies,\r\nalso to suppress the retail trade conducted there by the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAs a result of Sanchez's embassy to Spain, the king and his counselors\r\ndecide to institute many reforms in the Philippines, and to send\r\nthither a royal governor in place of the Audiencia. For this dignity\r\nis selected Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, and the king's instructions to\r\nhim (dated August 9, 1589) embody the changes to be made in the\r\ngovernment and life of the colony. The cathedral at Manila is to\r\nbe built, for which purpose the king appropriates the sum of twelve\r\nthousand ducados. Similar aid is to be granted to the two hospitals\r\nat Manila. More religious are to be sent to the islands. The rate of\r\ntribute from the Indians shall be increased from eight reals to ten;\r\nthis increase shall be used for tithes and the support of troops in\r\nthe islands; and the encomenderos must support religious instruction\r\namong the natives, and pay tithes. A grant of money for six years\r\nis made to the city of Manila; but the king declines to abolish\r\nthe customs duties--setting aside their proceeds, however, for the\r\npayment of the soldiers stationed in the islands--except those on\r\nfood and military supplies. Appointments and encomiendas must be\r\ngiven to old citizens, or to soldiers who have done actual service;\r\nand a list of persons who are to be rewarded for their services is\r\nfurnished to the new governor. Workmen are to be paid at Manila,\r\nnot, as heretofore, at Mexico. Trade with Mexico is restricted to the\r\ninhabitants of the Philippines. The question whether the Chinese and\r\nother foreign merchants are to be allowed to sell goods at retail at\r\nthe ports is left to the discretion of Dasmariñas. Only Christian\r\nChinese may remain in the islands. Agricultural colonists shall be\r\nsent thither from Spain, for whom various provisions are made; and it\r\nis expected that from them the Indians will learn the Spanish methods\r\nof farming. Cattle and horses are to be sent to the islands; and the\r\nfarmers sent out shall be ordered to tame and breed the wild buffaloes\r\nfound there. Agriculture shall be encouraged in all ways. A convent for\r\ngirls should be established, and its inmates provided with husbands;\r\nand Indian women should be enabled to marry poor Spaniards. Encomiendas\r\nmust be granted with great care, and must be provided with adequate\r\nreligious instruction. Dasmariñas is advised to settle lawsuits\r\namicably out of court, when possible. In disaffected encomiendas,\r\nonly part of the tributes should be collected. Suitable instruction\r\nfor the natives must be provided, and those who are dispersed should\r\nbe gathered into settlements where they can be taught the Christian\r\nfaith. The king appoints Bishop Salazar the official protector of\r\nthe Indians; and the governor is instructed to cultivate friendly\r\nrelations with him. A force of four hundred paid soldiers shall be\r\nmaintained in the islands, and various provisions are made for their\r\ndiscipline and welfare. The minimum age for military service is fixed\r\nat fifteen years, and the enlistment of mestizos is discouraged. The\r\ncity of Manila shall be fortified and garrisoned; and the governor is\r\ninstructed to be on his guard against various enemies, \"chiefly of\r\nthe Lutheran English pirates who infest those coasts,\" and to build\r\nforts and galleys for the defense of the islands. He is expected\r\nto continue the conquests begun there by the Spaniards, but only in\r\naccordance with instructions furnished him. He must do all in his power\r\nto pacify the Indians in the disaffected provinces. In attempting any\r\nmilitary expedition, the governor must consult with the most learned\r\nand experienced men of the community; he may contract with captains or\r\nencomenderos for the exploration or pacification of hitherto unsubdued\r\nregions. Provision is made for the instruction of the natives; and\r\nextortion and oppression of the natives in collecting the tributes\r\nmust be checked. All Indians enslaved by the Spaniards shall be\r\nimmediately set free. All lawsuits concerning the Indians shall be\r\nsettled as promptly and simply as possible. Religious persons sent to\r\nthe islands must remain there, except by permission of the authorities.\r\n\r\nOf especial value are two relations (1589) by the Franciscan missionary\r\nJuan de Plasencia, on the customs of the Tagalogs. He describes their\r\nsocial organization, which was originally patriarchal; and rights of\r\nproperty, which are partly individual and partly communistic. There\r\nare three classes among the people--nobles, commoners and slaves. The\r\nstatus and rights of each are carefully defined, and the causes and\r\nkinds of slavery. A somewhat elaborate system of regulations concerning\r\ninheritances is described, also the status of children by adoption,\r\nwhich usage is widely prevalent among the Tagalogs. Marriage,\r\ndowries, and divorce are fully treated. In the second of these\r\nrelations Plasencia describes their modes of burial and worship,\r\nand the religious beliefs and superstitions current among that\r\npeople. They have no buildings set aside as temples, although they\r\nsometimes celebrate, in a temporary edifice, a sort of worship. Their\r\nchief idol is Badhala, but they also worship the sun and the moon,\r\nand various minor divinities. They believe in omens, and practice\r\ndivination. A detailed account is given of the various classes of\r\npriests, sorcerers, witches, etc., in which the natives believed;\r\nalso of the burial rites of both Tagalogs and Negritos.\r\n\r\nA letter to the king from Portugal (written early in 1590) gives him\r\ninformation which he had requested from Portuguese officials in India,\r\nregarding the character and results of the trade between the Spanish\r\ncolonies and those established by the Portuguese in India and the\r\nEastern archipelago, and China. The continuance of this trade would,\r\nthey think, ruin the prosperity of the settlements in India, and\r\ngreatly injure the commerce of Spain, and deplete that country and her\r\ncolonies of their coin. At Salazar's petition, he receives from the\r\nking (April 12, 1590) a grant of money toward the payment of debts\r\nincurred by him in procuring the rebuilding of Manila in stone. On\r\nJune 20 of the same year, the members of the Audiencia, suppressed\r\nby order of the king and replaced by Dasmariñas, notify the king that\r\nthey have surrendered their posts, and ask him for various favors.\r\n\r\nBishop Salazar writes to the king (June 24) a special communication\r\nregarding the Chinese (or Sangleys) at Manila. He apologizes for\r\nhaving formerly given, under a mistake as to their character,\r\na wrong impression of that people; and relates various instances\r\nof their humane treatment of foreigners in their land. He blames\r\nthe Portuguese for having spread in China false reports about the\r\nSpaniards, and thinks that by this means the devil is trying to hinder\r\nthe entrance of the gospel into that land. The bishop urges that no\r\nhostile demonstration be made against the Chinese; for they are most\r\nfavorably inclined to the Christian religion, and many conversions may\r\nbe made among them. Most of Salazar's letter is devoted to the Chinese\r\nresidents of Manila, and their quarters there, which is called the\r\nParián. He narrates the gradual increase of the Chinese immigration\r\nto the islands, their relations with the Spaniards, the establishment\r\nof the Parián, and his efforts for their conversion. These last are\r\nineffectual until the coming of the Dominican friars in 1587; they\r\nassume the charge of converting the Chinese, and build their convent\r\nnext the Parián, which brings the friars into constant and friendly\r\nrelations with the Chinese. An interesting description of the Parián\r\nand its inhabitants is given; all trades are represented therein, and\r\nthe people carry on the manufactures to which they were accustomed\r\nin China, but with a better finish, which they have learned to use\r\nfrom the Spaniards. Salazar makes the enthusiastic statement that\r\n\"the Parián has so adorned the city [Manila] that I do not hesitate\r\nto affirm to your Majesty that no other known city in España, or\r\nin these regions, possesses anything so well worth seeing as this;\r\nfor in it can be found the whole trade of China, with all kinds of\r\ngoods and curious things which come from that country.\" Especially\r\ninteresting are the economic effects of their residence there;\r\n\"the handicrafts pursued by Spaniards have all died out, because\r\npeople all buy their clothes and shoes from the Sangleys, who are\r\nvery good craftsmen in Spanish fashion, and make everything at very\r\nlow cost.\" Salazar admires their cleverness and dexterity in all\r\nkinds of handiwork especially as they have learned, in less than\r\nten years, both painting and sculpture; \"I think that nothing more\r\nperfect could be produced than some of their marble statues of the\r\nChild Jesus which I have seen.\" The churches are thus being furnished\r\nwith images. A book-binder from Mexico had come to Manila, and his\r\ntrade has been quickly taken from him by his Chinese apprentice,\r\nwho has set up his own bindery, and excels his master. Many other\r\ninstances of the cleverness, ability, and industry of the Chinese\r\nare related; and the city is almost entirely dependent on them for\r\nits food supplies. Not the least of the benefits received from them\r\nby the city is their work as stone-masons, and makers of bricks and\r\nlime; they are so industrious, and work so cheaply, that Manila is\r\nrapidly being rebuilt with substantial and elegant houses, churches,\r\nand convents, of stone and brick. The day's wage of a Chinaman is one\r\nreal (equal to five cents of American money). So many Chinese are\r\ncoming to Manila that another Parián is being built to accommodate\r\nthem. Nearly seven thousand of them reside there, and in the vicinity\r\nof Manila, and four Dominican friars labor among them. Salazar reports\r\nthe condition and progress of the missions conducted by that order\r\nin the islands. Those who minister to the Chinese are securing some\r\nconverts, but many who are otherwise inclined to the Christian faith\r\nare unwilling thus to exile themselves from their own land. After due\r\ndeliberation, the Dominicans conclude to open a mission in China, and\r\nin that case to relax the rule compelling converts to cut off their\r\nhair and foresake their native land. This purpose they are enabled to\r\naccomplish, after encountering many difficulties, through the aid of\r\nsome Chinese Christians in Manila; and two friars are sent to China,\r\nMiguel de Benavides and Juan Castro. The Dominicans have also built a\r\nhospital for the Chinese; it is supported by alms, partly contributed\r\nby \"Sangley\" infidels; and its physician is a converted Chinese\r\nwho devotes himself to its service. This institution has won much\r\nrenown and commendation in China. Salazar asks that the king grant\r\nit some aid, and that he confirm a reward given by the governor to\r\nthe two Christian Chinese who aided the mission to China. Another\r\nletter from Salazar bearing the same date (June 24) recounts many\r\nthings concerning affairs in the islands. He protests against the\r\nroyal orders to increase the rate of tribute paid by the Indians,\r\nsaying that the king has been misinformed regarding their ability\r\nto pay. He makes comments on the several royal decrees which have\r\ncome in this year's mail. One commands that the conquerors make\r\nrestitution for the damages inflicted by them upon the natives; but\r\nthey or their heirs are tardy in paying the amounts levied for this\r\npurpose, and meanwhile the Indians live in great poverty and want. The\r\nbishop's heart and conscience are harassed not only by this, but by\r\nthe inability of the Spaniards to pay the full amount which is due\r\nthe Indians as restitution; he therefore asks the king to settle this\r\nmatter by remitting part of the amounts thus required. Salazar defends\r\nhimself for having encouraged the Indian slaves (who had been freed\r\nby royal decree) to leave their Spanish masters; and for obliging the\r\nChinese converts to cut off their hair. He also explains, as being\r\ngreatly exaggerated, the accusations brought against his clergy of\r\nengaging in traffic; and promises to do all in his power to check\r\nthem. One of the decrees settles the question of precedence between\r\nhim and the Audiencia; but, as that tribunal has been suppressed,\r\nit is now useless. Salazar takes this opportunity to defend himself\r\nagainst the aspersions cast upon him in this matter, and in regard\r\nto certain legal proceedings wherein the Audiencia had claimed that\r\nhe defied its authority. He declares that he always complied with\r\nits decisions or commands except in a few cases, which he explains in\r\ndetail; and complains that the Audiencia has at various times usurped\r\nhis jurisdiction, of which he relates instances.\r\n\r\nIn still another letter (of the same date) the bishop thanks his\r\nsovereign for recent kindness shown him, and for decrees favorable to\r\nthe Philippine colony. The money which the king ordered to be given\r\nfor building the cathedral at Manila has not yet been paid, as the\r\nroyal treasury there is so poor. Salazar comments on certain recent\r\ndecrees by the king: that the friars should not leave the islands\r\nwithout permission from the authorities; that tithes be remitted for\r\ntwenty years to new settlers in the islands; and that the processes\r\nof justice be simplified, and pecuniary fines abrogated. The bishop\r\nreiterates his complaint against the cruelty and injustice with which\r\nthe Spaniards collect the tributes from the natives, and the dearth\r\nof religious instruction for the latter; he feels responsible for this\r\ninstruction, yet cannot provide it for lack of religious teachers. If\r\nmore priests can be sent, great results can be achieved. The spiritual\r\ndestitution of that region is so great that \"of the ten divisions of\r\nthis bishopric, eight have no instruction; and some provinces have\r\nbeen paying tribute to your Majesty for more than twenty years, but\r\nwithout receiving on account of that any greater advantage than to be\r\ntormented by the tribute, and afterward to go to hell.\" If religious\r\nteachers are supplied, it will be comparatively easy to complete\r\nthe pacification of the Indians who are now hostile; then the royal\r\ntreasury will receive, from the increase in the tributes, far more than\r\nit would now expend in sending out the missionaries. The bishop asks\r\nthat, as he is now appointed by the king the protector of the Indians,\r\nhe may have also funds for the expenses and assistants necessary for\r\nthis office; also that the same protection may be extended toward\r\nthe Chinese, who need it even more than the Indians. A royal decree\r\n(July 23, 1590) orders that the trade with China shall be confined\r\nfor six years to the inhabitants of the islands.\r\n\r\nNext follows a long document, a collection of papers (bearing\r\nvarious dates in 1591) relating to the collection of tributes in\r\nthe islands. The first is a memorandum of the resources and needs\r\nof the hospital at Manila; the former are so small, and the latter\r\nso great, that the institution is badly crippled. A short letter\r\nby Bishop Salazar (dated January 12) classifies the encomiendas\r\naccording to the amount of religious instruction given therein,\r\nand lays down the conditions which ought to govern the collection\r\nof tributes. He declares that the encomendero has not fulfilled his\r\nobligations to the Indians under him by merely reserving a fourth\r\nof the tributes for building churches; and advises that the small\r\nencomiendas be combined to form larger ones. This letter is followed by\r\ntwenty-five \"conclusions\" (dated January 18) relating to this subject,\r\nwhich express the opinions of bishop and clergy on the collection of\r\ntributes from the Indians. These define the purposes for which this\r\ntax should be collected, the restrictions under which collections\r\nshall be permitted, and the respective duties in this matter of the\r\nencomenderos, ministers of religion, and governors, They declare that\r\nrestitution should be made for all tribute unjustly collected from\r\nthe natives--which includes all that is taken from pagans who have\r\nnot been instructed, or from any Indian by force. Another letter\r\nby the bishop (dated January 25) accompanies this document. He\r\nstates that he does not desire to forbid the encomenderos from\r\npersonally collecting the tributes. He advises that the amount of\r\nsuch collections should be reduced, and that the Spaniards should not\r\nbe too heavily mulcted for the restitutions which should be made to\r\nthe Indians. The governor replies to these communications, expressing\r\nmuch interest in the Indians and desire to lighten their burdens. The\r\ncollections should be uniform in rate everywhere, and of moderate\r\namount. Certain requirements should be made from the encomenderos,\r\nespecially in regard to the administration of justice; but they must\r\nbe enabled to retain their holdings. The governor wishes to adopt\r\nsome temporary regulations which shall be in force until the king can\r\nprovide suitable measures. On February 15 the city officials and the\r\nencomenderos present a petition to the governor. They complain of the\r\npressure exerted upon them by the clergy and the friars to prevent\r\nthe collection of the tributes; and entreat the governor to interpose\r\nhis authority, and to secure a royal mandate, in order that they may\r\ncollect the tributes without ecclesiastical interference, or else\r\nto permit them to return to Spain. Salazar answers (February 8) the\r\nprevious letter of Dasmariñas; this reply, and the opinions furnished\r\nby the religious orders, we synopsize in our text, as being somewhat\r\ntoo verbose for the edification of our readers. Salazar answers the\r\nobjections made to his earlier statements, and assures the governor\r\nthat the encomenderos can live on one-third of the tributes, that\r\nthere is no danger of their abandoning their holdings, and that the\r\nchief obstacle to the conversion of the pagans is the cruelty of the\r\nSpaniards. He urges the governor to reform the abuses practiced by\r\nthem, and to do justice to the poor Indians; and says that the clergy\r\nwill cooperate with him in this. The heads of the religious orders\r\n(except the Dominicans) send written opinions on this subject to\r\nthe governor; and the Jesuits discuss certain measures proposed by\r\nthe bishop, with some of which they disagree. The remainder of the\r\ndocument on tributes will be presented in _Vol_.

Asensio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelation of the Philipinas Islands\r\n\r\n\r\nMost potent Sir:\r\n\r\nI, the bishop of the Philipinas, declare that to your Highness [1]\r\nit is evident and well-known that the greater number of the natives in\r\nthese islands are yet to be converted, and that many of those who are\r\nconverted are without instruction, because they have no one to give\r\nit; and because, even in the districts where there are ministers,\r\nthey are so few, and the natives so numerous, that they cannot give\r\nthe latter sufficient instruction. I have, moreover, been informed\r\nthat in a letter which the cabildo of this city of Manilla wrote to\r\nyour Highness last year there was a section in which they gave your\r\nHighness information of the districts and localities in these islands\r\nwhere instruction is provided, and of those where it is not, and of\r\nthe number of ministers who are necessary to furnish instruction to\r\nthe natives therein. This letter, with all the others which went in\r\nthe said year on the ship \"Sancta Ana,\" was lost. For the relief of\r\nyour royal conscience and my own, and for the welfare of the said\r\nnatives, it is best that an order be given that those natives who are\r\nconverted shall be supplied with ministers to instruct and maintain\r\nthem in the Christian faith; for it is well known that, as soon as\r\nministers fail them, they return to their rites and idolatries--in\r\nsome districts, because they have lacked ministers for many years;\r\nand, in others quite near here, because those religious who had them\r\nin charge have abandoned them. This is well known to your Highness,\r\nthrough the information that has been given your Highness many times\r\nfrom this Audiencia. I am ready to furnish you sufficient information\r\nin this regard, if your Highness be so inclined. It is necessary\r\nalso that ministers be furnished to the natives yet unconverted,\r\nthat they may teach them and look after their conversion, since all\r\nof these Indians are under the dominion of your Highness, and pay\r\ntribute, as if they were Christians and received instruction. Unless\r\nministers come hither from España, it is impossible to make good\r\nthese deficiencies, or to supply the great lack of instruction. In\r\norder that this matter may be manifest to your Highness, and that you\r\nmay be pleased to command that a remedy be provided, according to the\r\ngreat necessity for instruction in these islands, I ask, and, in order\r\nthat the said need may be more certainly evident to your Highness,\r\nit is fitting, that the [above-mentioned] section of the said letter\r\nbe sent to your royal hands. I beg and supplicate your Highness that\r\nyou order the notary of the cabildo of this said city to draw up from\r\nthe book of the cabildo one, two, or more copies of the said section,\r\npublicly and duly authenticated, in order to approach therewith your\r\nroyal person--for which, etc.\r\n\r\n_The Bishop of the Philippinas_\r\n\r\n\r\n(In Manilla, on the third day of the month of June in the year one\r\nthousand five hundred and eighty-eight. The honorable president and\r\nauditors of the royal Audiencia of these Philipinas Islands being in\r\npublic session, this petition was read; and after examination by the\r\nsaid members of the Audiencia, they declared that the request of the\r\nbishop should be granted.\r\n\r\n_Juan de la Paraya_)\r\n\r\n\r\n(In fulfilment of the above order, I, Simon Lopez, notary of the king,\r\nour lord, and of the cabildo of this distinguished and ever loyal city\r\nof Manilla, [2] have caused to be made, from the books and papers of\r\nthe cabildo which are in my possession, a copy of the relation which\r\nis mentioned in the present memoir. It is as follows:)\r\n\r\n_Relation of the natives now inhabiting these Western Islands--those\r\nwho are pacified, and from whom tribute is collected, both those who\r\nare under control of his Majesty and those allotted to encomenderos;\r\nalso of the religious, and the instruction given by them, among the\r\nnatives; of the number of Spanish inhabitants, both in this city of\r\nManila and in the settlements outside of it; and of the ministers of\r\nreligion who are needed here_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Manilla_\r\n\r\nThis city of Manilla was founded in the island of Luzon, which\r\nis very fertile and populous. Outside of it, within the circuit\r\nof five leagues, are settled seven thousand five hundred Indians;\r\nfour thousand of these belong to his Majesty, and the rest, three\r\nthousand five hundred, are allotted to four encomenderos. There are\r\neight Augustinian friars, in four residences, and in another house\r\nare two Franciscans, one of whom is a lay brother, all of the rest\r\nbeing priests. In order that sufficient instruction be furnished the\r\nIndians, five more religious are needed.\r\n\r\nThis city has eighty citizens. It contains the cathedral and the\r\nbishop's house, and the ecclesiastical dignitaries--the latter\r\nconsisting of an arch-deacon, a schoolmaster, two canons, thirteen\r\nclerics who are priests, and a few candidates for holy orders.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of St. Augustine, which usually has seven or eight\r\nreligious, four priests, and three brothers and candidates for\r\nholy orders.\r\n\r\nThe monastery of St. Francis, which usually has four priests, and\r\neleven or twelve other professed members and novices.\r\n\r\nOf the Society of Jesus, the father superior, with two other fathers\r\nand two brothers.\r\n\r\nA royal hospital for Spaniards, and another (in the Franciscan\r\nmonastery) for the Indians.\r\n\r\nThere are, ordinarily, two hundred soldiers in this city, quartered\r\namong the citizens and in the houses of the Indians near them. These\r\nsoldiers are very poor, and are sustained by alms, as are likewise the\r\ninmates of the monasteries and hospitals--although four hundred pesos\r\nare given every year from the treasury, besides two hundred fanégas\r\nof rice, for the support of four Augustinian religious; and the royal\r\nhospital possesses an encomienda worth six or seven hundred pesos.\r\n\r\nFifty Spaniards in the city have married Spanish women; and some of\r\nthe others, native Indian women. There are fifteen Spanish widows;\r\nalso eight or ten girls who are marriageable, and some others who\r\nare very young.\r\n\r\nThe president and three auditors, one fiscal, one alguaçil-mayor,\r\ntwo secretaries--one for the Audiencia, and the other for the\r\ngovernment--one bailiff, one keeper of the antechamber, two reporters,\r\none proctor of the exchequer, four attorneys and as many interpreters,\r\n[3] four commissioners of examination, two alguaçils of the court,\r\none prison warden, the officials of the royal Audiencia, an officer\r\nto serve executions for the same, and one notary.\r\n\r\nThe governing body of the city, with two alcaldes-in-ordinary,\r\nan alguaçil-mayor, twelve regidors, bailiffs, six notaries public,\r\ntwo attorneys, a depositary-general, a chancellor, and registrar,\r\na superintendent of his Majesty's works, two city watchmen, and one\r\nfor vagabonds.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty captains, only four of whom have companies in\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\nAll the above is confined to the said eighty citizens of this city,\r\nleaving out of account the churches, hospitals, and monasteries. Inside\r\nthis city is the silk-market of the Sangley merchants, [4] with shops\r\nto the number of one hundred and fifty, in which there are usually\r\nabout six hundred Sangleys--besides a hundred others who live on\r\nthe other side of the river opposite this city; these are married,\r\nand many of them are Christians. In addition to these there are more\r\nthan three hundred others--fishermen, gardeners, hunters, weavers,\r\nbrickmakers, lime-burners, carpenters, and iron-workers--who live\r\noutside the silk market, and without the city, upon the shores of the\r\nsea and river. Within the silk market are many tailors, cobblers,\r\nbakers, carpenters, candle-makers, confectioners, apothecaries,\r\npainters, silversmiths, and those engaged in other occupations.\r\n\r\nEvery day there is held a public market of articles of food, such as\r\nfowls, swine, ducks, game-birds, wild hogs, buffaloes, fish, bread,\r\nand other provisions, and garden-produce, and firewood; there are\r\nalso many commodities from China which are sold through the streets.\r\n\r\nTwenty merchantmen generally sail hither each year from China, each\r\none carrying at least a hundred men, who trade from November until\r\nMay--in those vessels coming hither, living here, and departing\r\nto their own country, during these seven months. They bring hither\r\ntwo hundred thousand pesos' worth of merchandise, only ten thousand\r\npesos being in food supplies--such as flour, sugar, biscuits, butter,\r\noranges, walnuts, chestnuts, pineapples, figs, plums, pomegranates,\r\npears, and other fruits, salt pork, and hams--and in such abundance\r\nthat the city and its environs are supported thereby during the whole\r\nyear, and the fleets and trading-vessels are provisioned therefrom;\r\nthey bring also many horses and cows, with which their land is well\r\nsupplied. For two years, merchantmen have come hither laden with goods\r\nfrom Japon, Macaon, Cian [Siam], and other places, in order to trade\r\nin this city. The people of those countries are consequently becoming\r\ndesirous of our friendship and trade, and many of the inhabitants of\r\nthose nations are being converted.\r\n\r\nThey carry to their own countries, from this land, gold, wax, cotton,\r\ndye-woods, and small shells, which latter pass for money in their\r\ncountry, being used besides for many things, whereby they are held\r\nin much esteem. They bring hither silks--figured satins, black and\r\ncolored damasks, brocades and other fabrics--which are now very\r\ncommonly seen, a great quantity of white and black cotton cloth,\r\nand the above-mentioned articles of food.\r\n\r\nOutside of this city and the above-mentioned villages lying within\r\nfive leagues of it, there are seven well-populated provinces in\r\nthis same island of Luzon--namely, Panpanga, Pangasinan, Ylocos,\r\nCagayan, Camarines, La Laguna, and Bonbon y Balayan. These include\r\nthree Spanish settlements--namely, Camarines, Ylocos, and Cagayan,\r\nand have the following number of tributarios [i.e., Indians paying\r\ntribute] and encomiendas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The province of Panpanga_\r\n\r\nThe province of Panpanga has twenty-two thousand tributarios, of\r\nwhom seven thousand belong to his Majesty, and fifteen thousand\r\nare apportioned among eleven encomiendas. There are eight houses\r\nof the religious of St. Augustine, and one house of St. Francis, in\r\nwhich are sixteen Augustinian priests and one Franciscan. In another\r\nhouse is a Dominican, who is a coadjutor of the bishop. All together,\r\nthere are eighteen priests. In order that sufficient instruction be\r\ngiven in this province, twenty-six more priests are needed; because,\r\nat the very least, a thousand tributarios means four thousand people,\r\nwho require two religious--and in this ratio throughout the islands,\r\nwhere, it is believed, there will be a great increase of people and\r\nof their instruction. This province has an alcalde-mayor, and needs\r\ntwo corregidors.\r\n\r\nThis province is fifteen leagues in circuit, and is situated, at the\r\nvery most, a like distance from this city. Between this province and\r\nthat of Pangasinan, which is adjacent to it, there are three thousand\r\nIndians apportioned between two encomiendas; they are Çanbales, and\r\nmany of them are pacified. Living at a distance of twenty-five or\r\nthirty leagues from this city are more than three thousand others of\r\nthis same race--brave mountaineers--still to be pacified; and we have\r\nnot the wherewithal to send twenty soldiers for that purpose. This\r\nentire population is without instruction. It needs six ministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The province of Pangassinan_\r\n\r\nThe province of Pangassinan has five thousand tributarios, pacified,\r\nbut without instruction. It is forty leagues' distance from this city,\r\nby either land or sea. His Majesty possesses one thousand five hundred\r\nof its tributarios, and the rest are held by five encomenderos. It\r\nhas one alcalde-mayor. Ten religious are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The province of Ylocos_\r\n\r\nFive leagues beyond Pangasinan, by either land or sea, begins the\r\nprovince of Ylocos, which is inhabited for forty leagues inland. It has\r\ntwenty-seven thousand tributarios. Of these the king has six thousand,\r\nand twenty-one thousand are in fourteen encomiendas. There are three\r\nAugustinian religious in two houses or districts, and two ecclesiastics\r\nin two others. Fifty others are needed. There is a considerable\r\npopulation of mountaineers who recognize no master. This province\r\nhas an alcalde-mayor, and the [Spanish] population of a small town.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The province of Cagayan_\r\n\r\nThe province of Cagayan has many rivers and bayous. On its principal\r\nriver, by name Taxo, the city of Nueva Segovia has been founded,\r\nbeing situated two leagues inland. This city has forty citizens\r\nwho are encomenderos. It has one Augustinian monastery, containing\r\ntwo priests; one alcalde-mayor, two alcaldes-in-ordinary, one\r\nalguaçil-mayor, and six regidors, who constitute the cabildo;\r\nand a royal hospital, which has for its income the tribute-money\r\ncollected here for his Majesty. There is a fort with seven large\r\npieces of artillery, and an equal number of small pieces--such as\r\nsmall culverins and falcons--a number of muskets and arquebuses,\r\npikes, and coats-of-mail, which constitute the weapons and armor\r\nused in this land. For its maintenance this fort has assigned to it\r\nthe tribute from one village, which amounts to about one hundred\r\npesos. It has its own governor. The forty citizens of this city\r\nmaintain in addition forty soldiers, who help to pacify, conquer,\r\nand collect the tribute of the encomiendas. Ten of these citizens\r\nare married, the remainder single. Twenty-six thousand Indians, of\r\nwhom seven thousand are pacified and pay tribute, are apportioned\r\nto thirty-three of these citizens--some along the principal river\r\nTaxo, and the remainder in the districts near the same. Along this\r\nriver and in its neighborhood his Majesty has one thousand seven\r\nhundred tributarios, of whom a thousand are pacified and pay their\r\ntribute. This river Taxo is very broad and deep, and large vessels\r\ncan ascend it even to the city. It has an excellent bay. It rises\r\nfifty leagues inland, and is inhabited along its entire course by the\r\nabove-mentioned people. Its water is excellent, and the whole land is\r\nquite fertile and healthful, and abounds in rice, swine, fowls, and\r\npalm-wine; and there is much hunting of buffaloes, deer, wild hogs,\r\nand birds. A great amount of wax, cotton, and gold is collected in\r\nthis district, in which articles the natives pay their tribute. Two\r\nleagues opposite the bar of the river Taxo is the dense population of\r\nthe Babuyanes Islands. One island is an encomienda under the control\r\nof his Majesty, and is said to contain one thousand men. The tribute\r\nhas not been collected, because the inhabitants, it is said, are not\r\npacified. The eight other islands are distributed among the seven\r\n[other] citizens [of Nueva Segovia]. They number three thousand men,\r\nmore rather than less from all of whom their masters collect three\r\nhundred tributes. All of these islands are distant three or four\r\nleagues from one another. Sixty priests would be needed for the care\r\nof these thirty thousand Indians, counting two priests to each thousand\r\ntributarios. At the present time, sixteen priests are needed for those\r\nwho are pacified, as we have said. These priests are very important\r\nfor the pacification and permanent settlement of the natives, and for\r\n[the spiritual needs of] the soldiers. This province of Cagayan lies\r\nseventy leagues from the mainland of China and the coast cities of\r\nthat country. Seventy ministers are necessary, who, with the help and\r\nprotection of the soldiers, will gather the inhabitants together and\r\npacify them all, and seek out the rest of the people--who, as we are\r\ninformed, exist in great number as far as Cagayan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The province of La Laguna_\r\n\r\nThe province of La Laguna [\"the Lake\"], commences at the lake--which is\r\nthe body of water above this city of Manilla where the river of this\r\ncity rises, as well as others in the mountain hard by--six leagues\r\nfrom this city. [5] It is about twenty leagues in circuit, and in\r\nthis territory, inhabited by eleven thousand Indian tributarios,\r\nthere are twelve religious houses--ten of Franciscans, with fifteen\r\npriests and nine brothers; one of Augustinians, with three priests;\r\nand, in the other house, one ecclesiastic. Two thousand seven hundred\r\nof the inhabitants are his Majesty's, and two thousand four hundred\r\n[6] are distributed among eight encomenderos. Of all the provinces\r\nin these islands, this one has the most instruction. It needs three\r\nmore priests. It has one alcalde-mayor, and should have besides one\r\ncorregidor. Near the coast of the bay of this city is the province\r\nof Bonbon y Balayan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The province of Bonbon y Balayan_\r\n\r\nThe province of Bonbon contains the people of the Lake, who amount\r\nto four thousand men, belonging to the Mariscal. [7] It comprises\r\nthe villages of Batangas, Galbandayun, Calilaya, and the lowlands\r\nof Balayan, which amount in all to nine thousand tributarios. His\r\nMajesty has one thousand two hundred of them, and five encomenderos\r\nseven thousand eight hundred. There are four religious houses--two of\r\nAugustinians, in Bonbon and Batangas; and the other two of Franciscans,\r\nin Balayan and Dayun. These houses contain four Augustinian priests,\r\nand three Franciscan priests and two brothers. Ten more ministers\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Province of Camarines_\r\n\r\nThe province of Camarines lies fifty leagues from this city. In\r\nit is located the city of Caçeres, with thirty citizens, who have\r\ngenerally thirty soldiers quartered among them. Twenty of these\r\ncitizens are married, six of them to native women. The city has\r\nits own cabildo and governing body; also a church with one vicar,\r\none Franciscan monastery with two priests and two brothers besides,\r\nand one alcalde-mayor. It could have three more corregidorships.\r\n\r\nThis province has twenty thousand tributarios, of whom two thousand\r\nfive hundred are his Majesty's, and seventeen thousand five hundred\r\nare distributed among twenty encomiendas.\r\n\r\nThere are ten Franciscan houses in this province, besides the convent\r\nof the city, with eleven priests and eight brothers in all. There\r\nare two more ecclesiastics in two districts, not counting the curate\r\nof the city. Twenty more priests are necessary. The faith has had an\r\nexcellent opening in this province of Camarines, and the preaching\r\nof the gospel has shed its rays far and wide therein. The natives\r\nare especially inclined to the sacrament of Penitence; and it is a\r\nthing to marvel at, to see the churches continually filled, especially\r\nduring Lent, with people asking confession.\r\n\r\nThe people of this province are simple and well disposed. Their\r\ncountry is delightful in its location, being healthful and very\r\nbeautiful. The chase yields many wild hogs, deer, and buffaloes;\r\nand there are many birds, such as hens, ducks of many varieties, the\r\nsmaller birds, and many others. There is a river where fish abound\r\nin great plenty, especially swordfish, and many black shellfish,\r\nthe latter being gathered at the river. There is much fine scenery\r\nin this province, and it contains many springs and rivers of fresh,\r\nclear water, on account of which there is always abundance of excellent\r\nwater in this province. Near the boundaries of the province are two\r\nvolcanoes of great size and remarkable beauty--one of fire, and the\r\nother of water. [8] According to the report of the natives who have\r\nclimbed up to the volcano of water, there are many royal eagles there,\r\nbesides much white honey and wax, and fruits of various kinds.\r\n\r\nThe entire population of this province is in encomiendas, separated\r\ntwo or three leagues, or even a less distance, from one another;\r\nand all these encomiendas are contained within thirty leagues.\r\n\r\nBesides this island of Luzon, there are many other inhabited islands,\r\nsituated close to it, within a circuit of one hundred leagues. There\r\nare two more Spanish colonies--one the city of Nonbre de Jesus,\r\nin Çebu; and the other the town of Arevalo, [9] in Oton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concerning Cubu_\r\n\r\nThe city of Cubu has thirty citizens, among whom are quartered twenty\r\nsoldiers. These citizens are all encomenderos, and all married to\r\neither Spanish or Indian women. Their encomiendas are located among\r\nthe neighboring islands, there being thirty-two encomiendas with\r\neighteen thousand tributarios. Here his Majesty possesses some few\r\nlittle hamlets, in which but little tribute is collected, and the\r\nnatives of the city--who by special privilege pay no tribute, because\r\nfrom the very first they received the Spaniards in a friendly manner,\r\nfurnishing the camp with provisions, and showing themselves loyal\r\non many occasions. This city has a church, with one vicar; and one\r\nAugustinian monastery, containing three or four religious. In all\r\nthose encomiendas there is no other instruction. Three more priests\r\nare necessary.\r\n\r\nThis city has a municipal council and alcaldes; and has a fortress\r\nprovided with three or four large pieces of artillery, and some\r\nsmall ones, such as falcons and small culverins; and having its own\r\ngovernor. This fort is located opposite Burney, the Malucos and\r\nMindanaos, and other infidel islands and kingdoms. This city has\r\none alcalde-mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The town of Arevalo_\r\n\r\nThe town of Arevalo is situated on the island of Oton [or Panay],\r\nand has twenty citizens; they are encomenderos, and have thirty\r\nsoldiers quartered among them. The town has a municipal council,\r\nalcaldes-in-ordinary, and one alcalde-mayor. In the islands near this\r\nsettlement there are twenty-two thousand tributarios; three thousand\r\nof these are his Majesty's, and nineteen thousand are distributed\r\namong eighteen encomiendas. There is one church and one vicar, and\r\none monastery with two Augustinians. Outside of the town, in certain\r\nof the encomiendas, are four more houses of the same order. The five\r\nhouses contain ten priests. Three or four more are needed.\r\n\r\nAll of these islands, as well as those of the settlement of Çubu,\r\nabound in flesh of wild hogs and birds; and in all the above-mentioned\r\nplaces many fowls and swine are raised. Tribute is paid in gold,\r\ncloth, wax, cotton thread, rice, and fowls, at a valuation based on\r\nthe peso of Tipuzque.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these islands and settlements, there are other\r\nislands, namely, Marinduque, Luban, Mindoro, Elen, Calamianes, with\r\ntwo thousand five hundred tributarios, besides a much greater number\r\nstill unpacified. None of them has any instruction, except Mindoro,\r\nwhere his Majesty has five hundred Indians who are instructed. One\r\necclesiastic in the islands of Calamianes collects the tribute,\r\nin the name of his Majesty, from two hundred more. We hear of many\r\nmore who are still unpacified. The rest are in two encomiendas. Six\r\necclesiastics are necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Above Relation_\r\n\r\nAccording to what is set forth in this relation, it is therefore\r\nevident that there are one hundred and forty-six thousand, seven\r\nhundred pacified tributarios in this island of Luzon and the other\r\nislands of this government. Of this number his Majesty has twenty-eight\r\nthousand seven hundred. The religious number fifty-four Augustinian\r\npriests, and thirty-eight descalced Franciscan friars--all these\r\nfor this city and the instruction of the natives--with an additional\r\nnumber of some ten ecclesiastics, in curacies and vicariates outside\r\nof this city, as has been related. One hundred and ninety more priests\r\nare necessary for the instruction of the said natives, which number\r\nwill furnish sufficient instruction, counting for each thousand\r\ntributarios two religious--priests, friars, or ecclesiastics. These\r\nthousand tributarios amount to somewhat less than four thousand\r\npeople. It is quite certain that with adequate instruction, such\r\nas is indicated in the foregoing, many people, not yet pacified,\r\nwill become so, and the number of tributarios in the above-named\r\nprovinces would be increased to two hundred thousand. For we have\r\nheard that in the province of Cagayan there are many more people\r\nbesides those apportioned in encomiendas, as also in the islands of\r\n[Ca]lamianes, Mindoro, Luban, and Elin, as well as in many other\r\nislands included in the colonies of Oton and Çebu. In all of these\r\nthe Christian instruction and conversion would be extended through\r\nthe territories and provinces adjoining them, and the inhabitants\r\nwould be rendered obedient to his Majesty without the necessity of\r\narms and war; whereby God, our Lord, would be much pleased and these\r\nkingdoms greatly extended. The fathers of the Society, comprising\r\nbut three priests and two brothers, reside in this city, where by\r\nmeans of their teaching they produce the greatest results. They are\r\nstudying and learning the language of the natives and of the Chinese,\r\nin order to work among them when more of their Society come hither--a\r\npressing necessity, for which your Majesty should provide.\r\n\r\n(This relation, in its present sum and substance, was made by the\r\ncabildo of this city, in order that it might be sent to Father\r\nAlonso Sanchez, general agent for this city and these islands at\r\nhis Majesty's court. Made on the last of December, one thousand five\r\nhundred and eighty-six.\r\n\r\nThis copy was made and transcribed, corrected, and collated with\r\nanother copy in my possession, among the papers of the cabildo in\r\nManila, on the twenty-first day of the month of June, one thousand five\r\nhundred and eighty-eight, Francisco de Zarate and Alonso Maldonado\r\nbeing witnesses. Therefore, in testimony of the above, I, Simon\r\nLopez, notary of the king, our master, and of the cabildo of this\r\ndistinguished and ever loyal city of Manila, do affix hereunto my seal.\r\n\r\nIn testimony of the truth:\r\n\r\n_Simon Lopez_, notary of the cabildo)\r\n\r\n\r\n[The following matter is added by Salazar:] In addition to the towns\r\nnamed in this relation, I feel in duty bound to give your Majesty some\r\ngeneral information concerning certain islands which are named in\r\nit without making particular mention of them; and concerning others\r\nwhich are not mentioned at all, which are very important, and have\r\na large population.\r\n\r\nThe town of Arevalo, of which mention is made above, was founded\r\nin the island of Panay, which is one of the best islands of this\r\narchipelago. This island is one hundred leagues in circuit, and is\r\nwell populated. The Augustinian friars had charge of it when the\r\nrelation was written; but they abandoned it about six months ago,\r\non account of having an insufficient number of friars for their houses.\r\n\r\nNext to this island, at a league's distance, is the island of Ymaras,\r\nwhich is apportioned among encomenderos. It is about twenty leagues in\r\ncircumference, and has six hundred tributarios. Instruction has never\r\nbeen furnished it, although some Augustinian friars have visited it\r\nat times.\r\n\r\nNext this island of Ymaras, at three leagues' distance toward the\r\nsouth, is situated the island called Negros. It is much larger\r\nthan Panay, but not so densely populated. It had two Augustinian\r\nmonasteries, but they were abandoned more than five years ago, and\r\nthe baptized Christians were left without instruction. The island is\r\nwithout instruction now, and the baptized Christians have returned\r\nto their idolatries.\r\n\r\nThe island of Bantayan is small and densely populated. It has more than\r\neight hundred tributarios, most of them Christians. The Augustinians\r\nwho had them in charge have abandoned them also, and they are now\r\nwithout instruction. This island is twenty leagues from Zubu.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The island of Leyte_\r\n\r\nThe island of Leyte is thirty leagues south of Cubu. It is one of the\r\nmost excellent islands of this bishopric, and produces much food. It\r\nhas sixteen or eighteen encomenderos, and fifteen or sixteen thousand\r\ntributarios. It has never had, and has not now, any instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Island of Bohol_\r\n\r\nThe island of Bohol, situated near Çubu, is small and populated. It\r\nhas about six hundred tributarios.\r\n\r\nThe island of Mindanao is larger than that of Luzon, although it is\r\nbelieved to be not so well populated. Much of it is apportioned among\r\nSpaniards, and some of the natives pay tribute. For three years, the\r\npreachers of Mahoma have come into the regions hereabout, coming from\r\nBurney to Terrenate. We have heard that there are some Moros from Méca\r\namong them. The law of Mahoma is preached publicly at the very river\r\nof Mindanao, and mosques have been built and are being built. And it\r\nis to the shame of Christianity there that it does not hasten to drive\r\nthese preachers from that region, since the inhabitants are vassals\r\nof your Majesty, and have rendered your Majesty obedience for a long\r\ntime. The galleons sailing from India to Maluco know that island,\r\nand obtain water and provisions there. Fifty leagues from this island\r\nof Mindanao lies the island of Jolo, which has been given over to\r\nencomenderos these many years. It is an island where many pearls are\r\nfound, and where elephants are reared. The inhabitants have a king of\r\ntheir own, who is a relative of the monarch of Terrenate. Neither in\r\nthis island nor in that of Mindanao is there much Christian teaching;\r\nnor can there ever be, unless the people are pacified.\r\n\r\nThe island of Ybabao, situated between this island of Luzon and that\r\nof Cubu, is quite large, but does not contain many inhabitants. It\r\nhas a few encomenderos, is not yet entirely pacified, and has never\r\nhad any instruction. The island of Catanduanes is excellent and well\r\npopulated; it lies next to Camarines. There are four encomiendas\r\non it; it contains about three thousand tributarios, who up to the\r\npresent time have never had any Christian teaching. The island of\r\nMarinduque, lying about three leagues from this island, is divided\r\ninto encomiendas. It has about eight hundred tributarios, who have\r\nnever been instructed in the faith. From this island to the strait\r\ncalled Espiritu Sancto, many small islands are scatered--namely,\r\nMasbate, Capul, Burias, Banton, Conblon, Simara, Sibuyan, the island\r\nof Tablas, and many others--of which, because of their small size and\r\nscanty population, no mention is made, although all are apportioned\r\ninto encomiendas and tribute is collected in them every year. They\r\nhave no Christian teaching, nor hope of any.\r\n\r\nEighteen or twenty leagues west of the island of Panay, is located an\r\nexceeding fine and well-populated island, called Cuyo; it is very low\r\nand small. Together with seven small islands near by, it contains one\r\nthousand two hundred tributarios. Its inhabitants are rich, and the\r\nprincipal men live very well. The people of Burney have intercourse\r\nwith this island, and we suspect that they preach here the law of\r\nMahoma, although not so publicly as in Mindanao. Many goats, pheasants,\r\nand fowls of larger size than those of this region, are reared in\r\nthis island. Its encomendero goes thither each year in the months\r\nof February and March for the purpose of collecting his tributes,\r\nand, this done, returns to his home in the island of Panay. No other\r\ncommunication is held with this island. It has no instruction now,\r\nand has never had any.\r\n\r\nLying between the islands of Mindoro and Burney are a number of\r\nislands called the Calamianes. They are scantily populated, and are\r\nunder his Majesty's control. Great quantities of wax are collected\r\ntherein. Their inhabitants pay tribute also to the people of Burney,\r\nbecause the Spaniards do not trouble themselves about them further\r\nthan to collect the tribute, leaving them to whomsoever may come\r\nfrom Burney to rob them. They have never had any Christian teaching,\r\nnor is there hope of any speedily, because they are few in number\r\nand widely scattered.\r\n\r\nThe island of Mindoro is situated twenty-five leagues southwest of this\r\ncity. From the nearest coast of this island [Luzón] the distance to\r\nMindoro is about six leagues. This island of Mindoro is sixty leagues\r\nin circumference. It contains more than five thousand families, of whom\r\ntwo thousand pay tribute and are pacified. The remainder, for lack\r\nof men to subdue them, neglect to pay their tribute. Augustinian and\r\nFranciscan friars have been in this district, but all have abandoned\r\nit. There is at present one ecclesiastic there, who has the care of\r\nabout one thousand Christianized tributarios. All of the remainder\r\nof the inhabitants are infidels, and without instruction.\r\n\r\nNext to the island of Mindoro, and in the direction of this city, lies\r\nthe small island of Luban, with about five hundred tributarios. Its\r\ninhabitants are well disposed, and have asked me many times for\r\nChristian teaching; but, for lack of ministers to send to them,\r\nthey cannot have it.\r\n\r\nThis is the most trustworthy relation that your Majesty can have, in\r\norder that your Majesty may see clearly the great need for ministers\r\nwho shall labor for the conversion of these infidels, and for the\r\npreservation of those who have already received the faith, but are\r\nfalling back into their idolatrous practices, because they have been\r\nabandoned by those who baptized them. Many of the islands named in\r\nthis relation I have visited personally, and concerning the others\r\nI have been informed by those familiar with them; and, although it\r\nis not possible to know the exact truth, I have tried to ascertain\r\nit as nearly as I could. All of these islands are included in your\r\nMajesty's kingdom; all pay tribute, and in sufficient quantities\r\nto entitle them to receive instruction. Since your Majesty has in\r\nyour dominions so many and so excellent religious and ecclesiastics,\r\nwho, if your Majesty give the order, will prepare to come hither,\r\nmay your Majesty feel so strongly the ills of this land and its lack\r\nof religious workers, that you will order to come hither as many as\r\nare needed for the salvation of the great number of souls who are\r\nperishing here for want of religious teaching. Your Majesty should\r\nunderstand that, when we speak of such an island or town having so\r\nmany tributarios, we mean married men, or two single men who make one\r\nwhole tribute; so that when there are one thousand tributarios, it\r\nfollows that there must be two thousand persons. And it will happen\r\nmost frequently that the number will reach three or four thousand,\r\ncounting one or two children to each household. From the foregoing\r\nyour Majesty will realize clearly the countless number of souls under\r\nyour Majesty's charge, and who are waiting for your Majesty to provide\r\nthem with ministers of religion, in order that they may be drawn out\r\nof their present darkness, and placed on the pathway of salvation. At\r\nManila, June twenty-fifth, 1585 [sic; should be 1588].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Vera to Felipe II\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nIn the past year of 87, I sent your Majesty an account of the\r\ncondition of this land, by the usual route, and also one by way of\r\nIndia. As the voyage is so uncertain and dangerous, another duplicate\r\nis sent herewith; and I beg your Majesty to have it examined, as it\r\nis important for your service.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-seventh of February of this year, I had news from the\r\nPintados Islands that, on the seventh of the said month, at one of\r\nthe islands about eighty leagues south of Luçon, an English ship had\r\nbeen seen. With their small boat they had seized a Spanish sailor\r\nwho was coasting along carelessly in a small bark. He did not flee\r\nfrom the enemy, as he took them to be Spaniards and friends; for it\r\nis unusual for ships from England to come here. Next day the English\r\nlearned that a galleon of your Majesty was being built in the shipyard\r\nof Caigoan on the island of Panay. An attempt was made to land troops\r\nfor the purpose, as is supposed, of burning it; but it was defended\r\nby some carpenters and calkers who were working thereon. By this\r\nit may be inferred that the enemy carried but a small force. After\r\nthis resistance, the enemy went to Mindanao, leaving on an islet in\r\ntheir course the mariner whom they had taken prisoner. [10] From him\r\nI ascertained the fresh destruction planned for this country. He\r\nsays that several Spaniards, who were his fellow-prisoners on the\r\nEnglish ship, told him that your Majesty's galleon \"Santa Ana\" had\r\nbeen captured near California, a country on the mainland which is\r\ncontinuous with Nueva España. The galleon left this port in June of\r\nthe past year, 87; and as no other ships but ours have ever been\r\nsighted on this voyage, which is through so remote regions, they\r\nhave always sailed with little or no artillery, and with as little\r\nfear from corsairs as if they were on the river of Sevilla. Thus\r\nthe English easily captured the galleon, plundered and burned it,\r\nand hanged a canon of our church. The other persons were sent in a\r\nsmall boat to land, where it is believed that some of them have died\r\nof starvation and hardships. From this galleon there was plundered\r\na thousand marcos of registered gold, and there must have been as\r\nlarge a sum unregistered; twenty-two and one-half arrobas of musk,\r\nan abundance of civet, and many pearls, and the richest of silks and\r\nbrocades. At this capture, the enemy took with them [from the \"Santa\r\nAna\"] several skilful mariners and a pilot, to guide them to these\r\nislands. The captive mariner knew these men, and in conversation with\r\nthem he learned what I have related. This ship left England with two\r\nothers, and plundered sixteen ships off the coast of Piru. One of the\r\nthree was lost; the remaining two captured the said galleon \"Santa\r\nAna,\" and came to these islands. They were separated in a storm,\r\nand only this one arrived. It brought about fifty men, most of them\r\npilots. This mariner noticed that this vessel carried twenty-five\r\npieces of bronze, and cast-iron artillery, and much ammunition. The\r\nship is small, of about one hundred and fifty toneladas, staunch\r\nand well fitted. There is no doubt that they have plundered more\r\nthan a million [pesos'] worth of gold, pearls, musk, civet, and rich\r\nmerchandise, which all belonged in Nueva España. The Spaniards there\r\nwould have been diligent in pursuing this corsair; but, as I received\r\ninformation so late, and the enemy only reconnoitered here, without\r\nremaining at any place, to inform them would have done no good. I\r\nsent word to Maluco, whither it seems the enemy directed his course,\r\nto the captain-general and to the sea-captains who might be there\r\nwith their galleons; also to the petty kings friendly to your Majesty,\r\nand to the fort at Ambueno--where, it is understood, this corsair is\r\ngoing to spend the winter and repair his ship. Captain Francisco is\r\nat an island of that archipelago called Jula, near either Macasar or\r\nJapara. I advised the sending of a message to him, and the exercise\r\nof diligence, as they have greater facility for obtaining news there\r\non account of the many ships which are usually near at hand. And\r\nI advised them to follow the Englishman and ascertain where he was\r\ngoing to winter; for it was impossible to return immediately to his\r\nown country, because the weather began to be contrary. It would be\r\nnecessary to pass out through Sunda and other straits, of which the\r\nPortuguese are warned; and there it would be easy to await him and cut\r\noff his passage, as they hold him so closely. This account was given\r\nby a sailor--a native of this land--who was seized in the galleon,\r\nand carried away by the Englishman. He escaped at the mouth of the\r\nchannel of these islands, and I have kept him here with me. His\r\ndeclarations accompany this letter.\r\n\r\nThe first time when this galleon \"Sancta Ana\" sailed from here, I sent\r\nby her some artillery removed from your Majesty's forts, in order to\r\nprovide greater security. In Nueva España the artillery was taken out,\r\nand the ship returned without it. I thought that if I sent more on the\r\nships, and it were taken out over there, the forts here would be in\r\nneed, while the ships would gain nothing. Understanding that there was\r\nno danger from corsairs on the voyage, I sent the ships, as usual,\r\nwithout artillery. Now that I have seen the need for artillery,\r\nand the risk that they run, if it is not carried, I am sending\r\ntwo ships this year, each with four heavy pieces of artillery, two\r\nfalcon guns, and arquebuses and other arms carried by the sailors and\r\npassengers. I am collecting what metal I can find and making thereof\r\nsome pieces of ordnance with which to fill the place of those sent\r\nfrom the said forts. The merchants are paying your Majesty the value\r\nof the artillery, arms, and ammunition carried by one of the ships,\r\nand I have loaned the price of those of the other. They will pay\r\nthis also in the coming year, and the ships will sail armed at the\r\naccount and cost of the merchants. I beseech your Majesty to command\r\nthe viceroy of Nueva España to have the artillery and arms returned\r\nby the same ships; and that the pieces carried by the \"Sancta Ana\"\r\nbe returned to these forts, which greatly need them.\r\n\r\nIn another letter I have written to your Majesty about the general\r\nfire in this city. The powder and military supplies were burned and\r\nthe artillery destroyed. Although I have had the pieces recast, using\r\nthe metal which was left, there are only twenty-five heavy pieces and\r\nseveral lighter ones. This is but little artillery for the needs of\r\nthis land, for defense and the expeditions that are made. Some copper\r\nmines have been discovered but although at first they seemed to be\r\nvery rich, on commencing to work them, it was found that the labor\r\nwas expensive and there was but little metal. Everything necessary\r\ncould be brought from Macan, if your Majesty were pleased to have\r\nmoney sent from your royal treasury of Mexico for this purpose.\r\n\r\nI have already written to your Majesty of the necessity that, for the\r\npreservation of this land, the viceroy of Nueva España send annual\r\nreenforcements of troops, arms, and ammunition. As this has not been\r\ndone for three years, the majority of the troops have died, and there\r\nare now so few here, that if reenforcements are not supplied according\r\nto the requests of the governor and officers of the royal exchequer,\r\ngreat risk will be run, and what your Majesty has gained and preserved\r\nat cost of such labors and expenses will be irretrievably lost. I\r\nespecially beg your Majesty to order such provision to be made that\r\nso propitious a beginning be not lost, and the door closed which\r\nhas been opened by your Majesty for the conversion of so large and\r\npowerful kingdoms with untold riches and innumerable inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAccording to your Majesty's commands I had some galleys made in\r\nthese islands, and I have three at this port. They are of little use,\r\nbecause of the lack of men skilled in managing and sailing with lateen\r\nsails, and the scarcity of rowers. I have tried to keep up its crew by\r\nhiring men; but the natives are so despicable a people that they are of\r\nlittle use for this purpose, nor do they have sufficient strength for\r\nrowing. On hearing the report of an arquebus they throw themselves on\r\nthe ground, and do not rise even at the lash. I have selected three\r\nhundred Chinese, who are stronger, and who, if allowed liberty to\r\nquit the work, and exemption from tribute, will bind themselves to\r\nserve on the galleys. But although earnest endeavors have been made\r\nto teach them, they row very badly, and have as little energy as the\r\nnatives of these islands have. They row in their own country with\r\na sort of oar which they call _lios lios_. By means of these the\r\ngalley moves very slowly, and therefore they may be of some benefit\r\namong these islands. Better results would be obtained, however, if\r\ninstead of these galleys there were small ships of from sixty to a\r\nhundred toneladas with which it is easier to navigate here. I inform\r\nyour Majesty thereof in order that provision may be made according\r\nto the royal pleasure. As I have advised your Majesty, I have, in\r\nanticipation of future contingencies, commenced a good stone fort\r\nin this city, which will be entirely completed within a year. I have\r\nlevied taxes therefor upon the citizens and encomenderos; the Indian\r\ntributarios have each paid one real, while one per cent has been\r\ncollected for two years on the coin brought from Nueva España. I am\r\nsending to your Majesty the sketch and model of this fort; it is the\r\nstrongest which has been built in the Yndias, although it is not of\r\nmodern style. It was necessary to build it according to the condition\r\nof the country; it is round in shape, high, and covered over so as to\r\nbe more capacious. The climate is so hot, the sun so fierce and the\r\nrains so heavy, that if the soldiers who must defend the place were\r\nnot under cover they would perish from the heat, as would likewise\r\nthose who should undertake to erect the fort. The stone for the most of\r\nthe rampart is so suitable in quality that, wherever a ball strikes,\r\nthe wall remains unhurt, nor is any other injury inflicted. There\r\nis no fear that an attack by a battery can do as much damage as if\r\nthe stone were hard and resisting. The balls cannot be fired so as\r\nto strike, without great difficulty, as the fort is on the shore and\r\nthe country is perfectly level. Within there is fresh running water\r\nin abundance; and in addition to that, wherever one digs, excellent\r\ndrinking water is found. It is impossible to undermine the fort,\r\nbecause there is water around it, at a distance of one or two varas,\r\nor even less in some places. The city is surrounded by water--the sea\r\non one side; on another the moat, which extends to the river; and, on\r\nstill another side, the river itself. Thus the city is on an island;\r\nand, with the other bulwarks and the wooden fort, which I have had\r\nrepaired, this city is well defended, provided we had sufficient\r\ntroops and ammunition.\r\n\r\nI received your Majesty's letter on the twenty-second of May of this\r\nyear; and, by a royal decree of the first of December of the year 86,\r\nyour Majesty orders me to act in accordance with my best judgment,\r\nas your Majesty had understood that the auditors of this Audiencia\r\naccording to the present regulations, cannot visit the country out\r\nof their turn. I will fulfil your Majesty's commands and will render\r\nan account of all transactions.\r\n\r\nBy another royal decree of the nineteenth of August of said year,\r\nyour Majesty orders that, if it should appear necessary to me,\r\ncertain offices of notaries and magistrates in these islands should\r\nbe sold, under the condition that the persons who should be the\r\nhighest bidders should obtain confirmation of their title within\r\nthree years. These offices are of very little profit, and of none\r\nat all in some places, as the land has been settled so recently,\r\nand there are few inhabitants and little business therein. As it is\r\ncontinually becoming more populous and well established, it would\r\nbe more advantageous to postpone the sale of these offices for some\r\nyears, until they shall be worth more. I will make the necessary\r\ninvestigations, as your Majesty commands me, and will advise your\r\nMajesty of the prices offered. If I find that for any of them I\r\ncan obtain its value in the future I will have it auctioned. In the\r\nmeantime I will make endeavors to have them sold for a price that\r\ncan be profitable to your Majesty's royal exchequer.\r\n\r\nBy another decree of the twenty-seventh of August of said year,\r\nyour Majesty orders me to give my opinion of the arms that are in\r\nthe fort of the city of Manila, and those that are needed. In three\r\nforts which your Majesty has here, there are twenty-four heavy pieces,\r\ntwo small ones, and some culverins, as will be seen below.\r\n\r\nIn the stone fort there are three swivel-guns, located in the three\r\ncasemates, of about twenty quintals' weight. On the first floor over\r\nthe rampart, there are seven heavy pieces, extra thick and strong at\r\nthe breech. Two are of about forty quintals' weight, three varas in\r\nlength and carry a ball of cast iron weighing sixteen libras. Two\r\nothers are of wrought iron, of sixty quintals' weight, three and\r\ntwo-thirds varas in length, and carry a ball of cast iron weighing\r\nfifteen libras. One cannon is of fifty-five quintals' weight, four and\r\none-third varas in length, and carries a ball of cast iron weighing\r\nfourteen libras; one culverin, five and one-half varas in length,\r\nweighs one hundred and one quintals one arroba, and carries a cast\r\niron ball weighing seventeen libras; another piece of thirty-five\r\nquintals' weight, three varas in length, carries a cast iron ball\r\nweighing twelve libras.\r\n\r\nThe fort at the point has one cannon weighing twenty-five quintals;\r\nthree small cannon [_sacres_], weighing twenty-two; and a half-sacre\r\nweighing thirteen--the last, with its apparatus, being four varas\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nThe cavalier of the beach has a piece, extra thick and strong at\r\nthe breech, of forty quintals' weight which carries a ball weighing\r\nfifteen libras; and one half-sacre, of thirteen quintals' weight.\r\n\r\nAt the river there is a large swivel-gun with cross-bars, weighing\r\nthirty quintals; one cannon weighing twenty-six quintals, one sacre\r\nweighing twenty-two quintals, four half-sacres weighing thirteen or\r\nfourteen quintals, and two _esmeriles_ [a small piece of ordnance]\r\nweighing four or five quintals.\r\n\r\nFor the stone fort to be provided with artillery according to its\r\nplan and embrasures, it is necessary to have twenty-five pieces,\r\nthree of them heavy, and twelve sacres and half-sacres.\r\n\r\nThe cavalier of the beach needs five pieces, two of them heavy,\r\nand three sacres.\r\n\r\nThat at the point of the sea and the river needs six pieces--some\r\nsacres, and two swivel-guns.\r\n\r\nFor the service of the ships and galleys there are needed four\r\ncannon, six swivel-guns, six sacres, six half-sacres, and some small\r\nculverins. Thus sixty pieces in all are necessary to provide the\r\ncity well with artillery for defense, as well as for the galleys\r\nand ships of the fleet, and for the succor and pacification of all\r\nthese islands. There are only twenty-four needed, for there are now\r\nthirty-six. In the shipyard there are now four sacres of twenty-two\r\nquintals' weight, two of which have been cast, and the other two are\r\nabout to be cast. This class of arms is the best and most important for\r\nthis land these and the swivel-guns. This artillery could be provided,\r\nand much more be made, for other of your Majesty's strongholds in these\r\nislands and the Yndias, should your Majesty be pleased to have six or\r\neight thousand pesos sent annually from Mexico so that the metal could\r\nbe bought at Macao in China, as it is very plentiful and cheap there.\r\n\r\nAccording to the commission of your Majesty, I have proceeded\r\nagainst the royal officials in regard to their traffic and trade\r\nin merchandise. By the convictions of guilt which have resulted\r\nfrom the investigations and process of law, I have condemned the\r\nguilty to pay fines to the exchequer. There seems to have been no\r\ntraffic with funds in the royal exchequer; or, if there were any,\r\nno damage or injury to it has resulted. I am sending the testimony\r\nof the sentences and proceedings to your Majesty's royal Council,\r\nwhere your Majesty will order their examination, if such is your\r\npleasure. May God guard the Catholic person of your Majesty. Manila,\r\nJune twenty-sixth, of the year 1588.\r\n\r\nThe licentiate _Santiago de Vera_\r\n\r\n[_Endorsed_: \"Examined, with the other letter.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Domingo de Salazar to Felipe II\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nIn a letter which your Majesty had written to me from Madrid, on the\r\neleventh of January of the year 87, I see the reprimand which your\r\nMajesty gives me, on account of information that you had received that,\r\non certain occasions which had arisen, I had had controversies with the\r\nroyal Audiencia here; also that this has finally resulted in scandal\r\nand comment in the town, and that there was fault on both sides. I\r\nreceive this reprimand as from my king and lord, but, although it\r\ncomes from him, it is very serious and is sufficient to cause much\r\npain; nevertheless, I have not allowed myself to feel hurt, since your\r\nMajesty judges according to the information that you have received. He\r\nwho so informed your Majesty that I was made to appear guilty will\r\ngive account to God for his good or bad intention, since for my own\r\nsatisfaction the testimony of my conscience is all-sufficient. It is\r\nwell-known in the city, and outside of it, that if I had not entered\r\nas mediator neither the president and auditors, nor the auditors\r\nalone, would have had peace. It would not have been possible for me\r\nto establish peace if there had not been friendly relations between\r\nthem and me. Since they were pacified through my intercession, peace\r\nhas lasted until now; and in order that this peace be lasting, and\r\nthat there be no occasion for violating it, I humbly beseech your\r\nMajesty to be pleased to command the president and auditors not to\r\ninterfere with me in affairs which concern my privileges--since my\r\nlife is a very open one, a fact known to all. They have no cause for\r\ncomplaint because I sat down in my own church on the gospel side;\r\nfor, besides my being the father and pastor of this state, and having\r\nin charge the souls of the auditors, it is a very usual thing for\r\nbishops and archbishops to seat themselves in that very place in the\r\npresence of viceroys and presidents, without that act exciting any\r\nsurprise. For the sake of peace, I have overlooked the matter, and\r\nhave not again taken my seat in that place, hoping that your Majesty\r\nwould send commands concerning this and what ought to be done, since\r\nit is not right that I should leave to my successors the disputes\r\nand controversies with the Audiencia whereby results so much harm to\r\nthe commonwealth. It is of no less importance that the prelates be as\r\nmuch respected by the people as are the audiencias. The latter make\r\nthemselves feared by the power which they hold; but if the prelates\r\nare not favored by those who govern, they are speedily despised by\r\nthe people. Since your Majesty sees how important this matter is, may\r\nit be your Majesty's pleasure not to leave us in controversies, but\r\nto order that each shall do his duty without prejudice to the other.\r\n\r\nThe hardships and calamities sent by God to this land make me greatly\r\nfear that we who live here have seriously offended Him. For I have\r\nbeen here eight years, and not one year have I seen pass without the\r\nhappening of great calamities--loss of ships; death of the animals\r\nwhich maintained us; hurricanes, called here _baguios_, which tear\r\nup the trees by the roots and overthrow the houses completely, or\r\nleave them so that they cannot be inhabited; and the general fire\r\nof the year 83, of which your Majesty has been informed. Both before\r\nand since that time, this city has been burned three or four times;\r\nand now, as the last straw, the ship \"Santa Ana,\" which left this\r\ncity last year, the richest ship to leave these islands, fell into\r\nthe hands of the Lutherans. With that loss, and also that of the ship\r\n\"Sant Juan\" the year before, which likewise was laden with goods from\r\nthis country, some of the citizens of these islands are totally ruined,\r\nand others have suffered so heavy losses that it will be long ere,\r\nwith much difficulty, they regain their former state.\r\n\r\nIt is very evident, and can be denied by no one, that the loss of\r\nthat particular ship was ordained by God; for, three days before\r\nit reached the coast [of California], another ship--from Macao,\r\nbound for Mexico--passed the same place and was not sighted by the\r\nLutherans. When news was received in Piru of the coming of this pirate,\r\nthe viceroy sent in pursuit of them a good fleet, with many soldiers\r\nand ammunition sufficient to engage an equal or greater number. When\r\nthey came to the port of Acapulco, supplies were needed; and they\r\nrequested these from the purveyor who had them in your Majesty's\r\nwarehouses. He was unwilling to give them; and they even say that an\r\norder was given to detain some pack-teams which brought biscuits, so\r\nthat the captain of the fleet from Peru could not take them. Thus they\r\nsay that, as it was not desired to supply them with provisions, and\r\nbecause Doctor Palacios [11] became dictatorial in regard to several\r\npoints, they returned to Piru; while the Lutheran remained free to\r\nattack and capture, as he did. So great was our misfortune that, at the\r\ntime when the two captains were debating as to who should take command,\r\nthe pirate was near Puerto de la Navidad, which is not very far from\r\nAcapulco, repairing his ships. Had they attacked him, it would have\r\nbeen impossible for him to escape; but God chose to blind our men,\r\nso that we might be punished by this pirate. The punishment of God\r\ndid not stop here; for, having set fire to the ship \"Santa Ana,\" they\r\nleft it half burnt, set sail, and came to these islands. With more than\r\nhuman courage, they passed through the midst of them with a ship of one\r\nhundred toneladas, where the natives venture with trembling in very\r\nlight boats; but this infidel dared not only to come into our midst,\r\nbut to collect tributes from your Majesty's vassals. A Spaniard was\r\ncaptured, and after having told him what they wished him to say to us,\r\nthey put him ashore. What they said was in boast that they had left\r\nthe coasts of Peru and Nueva España utterly ruined; and that they had\r\nrobbed and burned the ship \"Santa Ana,\" and hanged a canon who was\r\non his way from this city to Mexico. In testimony of his prowess and\r\nour misfortune he displayed the silks, brocades, and cloths of gold\r\nwhich he had seized as plunder. Not content with this, he went away\r\nthreatening us that he is to return soon to drive us all hence, and\r\nto destroy the nest that we have made here--meaning thereby the stone\r\nfortress built here. The grief that afflicts me is not because this\r\nbarbarian infidel has robbed us of the ship \"Santa Ana,\" and destroyed\r\nthereby the property of almost all the citizens; but because an English\r\nyouth of about twenty-two years, with a wretched little vessel of\r\na hundred toneladas and forty or fifty companions, should dare to\r\ncome to my own place of residence, defy us, and boast of the damage\r\nthat he had wrought. As your Majesty has here an army of captains,\r\nwho, as I understand, are certainly as many as the companions of the\r\nLutheran, he went from our midst laughing, without anyone molesting\r\nor troubling him; neither has he felt that the Spaniards are in this\r\nland to any purpose. In this matter, I do not care to blame anyone,\r\nbecause I understand that the governor did his duty--although I was\r\nalways of the opinion that the pirate should be pursued and that the\r\nresult thereof would not be so bad as some say. The belief here,\r\nhowever, is that God is chastising us for our sins, and is making\r\nus the laughing-stock of other nations, who have all hitherto stood\r\nin such fear of us. I must explain to your Majesty two other points\r\nbearing on this subject, although it detains me somewhat, as I consider\r\nthat I do thereby a very great service. The first is the failure of\r\nthe expedition to Maluco. We all had been certain that with fewer men\r\nand less equipment than there actually were, the king of Terrenate\r\ncould be subdued; but, quite to the contrary, our men came back as\r\nif fleeing from an unknown foe. The Indians of this archipelago,\r\nwho feared us, now laugh; and, together with those of Terrenate,\r\nthreaten us. The second point is that in the island of Mindanao,\r\nwhich is subject to your Majesty, and for many years has paid you\r\ntribute, the law of Mahoma has been publicly proclaimed, for somewhat\r\nmore than three years, by preachers from Burney and Terrenate who\r\nhave come there--some of them even, it is believed, having come from\r\nMeca. They have erected and are now building mosques, and the boys\r\nare being circumcised, and there is a school where they are taught the\r\nAlcoran. I was promptly informed of this, and urged the president to\r\nsupply a remedy therefor at once, in order that that pestilential fire\r\nshould not spread in these islands. I could not persuade them to go,\r\nand thus the hatred of Christianity is there; and we are striving no\r\nmore to remedy this than if the matter did not concern us. Such are\r\nthe calamities and miseries to which we have come, and the punishments\r\nwhich God inflicts upon us. The reason for it, He only knows; but,\r\nas I infer and fear, it is because we have ill acquitted ourselves\r\nin this land, where it is so needful that we be upright and furnish\r\ngood examples. I have written to your Majesty on this point at other\r\ntimes; and I think that either my letters are not read, or what I\r\nsay is not credited. I assure your Majesty that I have never written\r\nanything which is not true, and free from all outward influence,\r\nor self-interest, or human considerations; but I have only done my\r\nduty. The temporal affairs of this land are in the condition which I\r\nhave related to your Majesty; and I consider that there will never be\r\nimprovement, since cupidity is increasing so immeasurably that neither\r\nthe punishments of God nor the threats of men are effectual to produce\r\nany moderation, nor do the manifold outrages cease to be felt.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual state, which is my concern, is in the sorriest condition,\r\nbecause there is no more respect for the things of God than if we\r\nwere not Christians. I refer to the Indians and their instruction; and\r\nbecause entering on this subject is like embarking on a bottomless sea,\r\nI have determined to send to your Majesty a relation of the islands and\r\ntowns of this bishopric which are without instruction, in order that\r\nyour Majesty's conscience may be relieved by commanding that the remedy\r\nbe applied. Therefore I shall now proceed with the said relation.\r\n\r\nThe cause of ruin in these islands--which is very menacing, although\r\nit is not declared in España--is that both the villages of your\r\nMajesty and those of encomenderos are places where the curacy is so\r\nill-supplied with chalices and ornaments that it is a shame to see\r\nthem. Many of the churches are so indecent that when I visited them,\r\nfrom pure shame I was obliged to command that they be torn down; they\r\nwere not fit to be entered by horses. There are two principal causes\r\nfor this: the first is that the encomenderos are penurious and allow\r\nlittle for the proper ornamentation of the church; and the second,\r\nthat some or the majority of the encomiendas are so small that they do\r\nnot suffice to support their encomenderos, who thus cannot attend to\r\nmatters of divine worship. Consequently, the natives come to regard\r\nthe things of God as of little worth, and have little esteem for our\r\nfaith and the Christian religion, seeing that we who profess to be\r\nChristians pay so little attention to them. Moreover, the natives of\r\nthese islands are so harassed and afflicted with public and private\r\nundertakings, that they are not able to take breath; nor do they have\r\ntime to observe the instruction, and hold it of so little account that\r\nwhen they lack for anything, it must be in the instruction and not in\r\ntemporal affairs. I cannot picture to your Majesty, nor declare what\r\nI feel in my heart about this matter. Moreover, I am very sure that\r\nall the chastisements given us by God, the hardships, misfortunes, and\r\ncalamities sent us, all are because of evil treatment of the Indians\r\nand the little heed taken for the principal reason for our coming--that\r\nis, their conversion and protection. The remedy therefor is not that\r\nyour Majesty send decrees and orders charging good treatment of the\r\nIndians, as in the letters which have already been received here; but\r\nthat a number of the best religious be sent. They can deal with these\r\nnatives, and defend them from the labors imposed by the Spaniards,\r\nand from the outrages that they inflict upon them. Again, it is of\r\neven more importance that, if your Majesty, as is rumored here, is\r\nto send hither a governor or president, he be a man free from all\r\nhuman interests, whose head could not be turned by the great gains\r\nin this country. He should not be married, nor should he bring with\r\nhim relatives or followers for whom to provide. For under any one of\r\nthe aforesaid conditions it is impossible to avoid the destruction of\r\nthis country, beyond the power of your Majesty to remedy it. I have\r\nwritten this to your Majesty several times before, and now I repeat it,\r\nsince it is the most necessary thing for the betterment of this land,\r\nwhich would be surely destroyed by its lack.\r\n\r\nOf the viceroy of Nueva España, so many things are said in this\r\ncountry, that if but one-tenth of them were true, it is impossible\r\nfor your Majesty to know them and fail to correct them. This is\r\nanother of the heavy afflictions that God has sent upon this land,\r\nfor even the severity which has been shown by him to those who\r\ngo from here is alone sufficient to make this land desolate. No\r\nconsideration is given to the fact that the citizens and soldiers\r\nthereof serve your Majesty with the same hardships and loyalty with\r\nwhich other men have served their king. Nevertheless, there is no\r\nlack of persons to inform your Majesty thereof, since the loss of\r\ntemporal things is always felt more than the spiritual. I leave it\r\nto be described by those who have felt the hurt, since it does not\r\nconcern me in any way, except the regret that I feel for the damage\r\ndone to my neighbors; for my enterprises and traffic are to remedy\r\nthe needs of the poor, and to defend and help the natives of these\r\nislands, who have much need thereof. The complaint that I make of the\r\nviceroy of Nueva España is that he has not allowed more than fifteen\r\nDominican friars to come here, although your Majesty sent to Mexico\r\nforty of them. This is the greatest damage that the viceroy could do\r\nto this country, as there is exceeding need of ministers of religion,\r\nsuch as come now. If the fifteen were five hundred, the evils of the\r\ncountry would be corrected, and the conscience of your Majesty quite\r\nat ease. It is such men that your Majesty should order to come here,\r\nand you should refuse to permit those to come who will do more harm\r\nthan good. Likewise your Majesty should order the generals of the\r\norders of St. Francis and St. Augustine to send hither visitors,\r\nwho are most necessary. Those of St. Augustine are to be preferred,\r\nhowever, as the friars of St. Francis are more retired from the world.\r\n\r\nI wrote to your Majesty, via Malaca, of what had happened with the\r\nreligious in regard to the observance of the royal decrees treating\r\nof the instruction of the Indians by the religious. As the licentiate\r\nAyala, fiscal of the royal Audiencia here, sent the records concerning\r\nthe subject, I shall but mention and not refer to them at length.\r\n\r\nAt other times I have written to your Majesty explaining the\r\nimpossibility of a bishop being able to govern all the bishopric which\r\nI have now. For this island of Luçon it is necessary to have two or\r\neven three bishops--that is to say, I humbly beseech your Majesty to\r\nbe pleased to provide for the Pintados Islands a bishop with his seat\r\nin the city of Çubu. By the relation which I am sending, your Majesty\r\nwill see that two bishops are not sufficient. I declare to your Majesty\r\nthat in that case the royal conscience would not be at ease nor would\r\nmine; and I dare not leave it unsaid, for fear of my peace of mind.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, I had determined to write nothing whatever in\r\ndetail concerning the damages that the viceroy of Nueva España had\r\ndone to these kingdoms. It seems to me that your Majesty will have had\r\nadvices thereof, and will have ordered a means of correction. Moreover,\r\nas many are interested and have grievances, there will be no lack of\r\na person to advise your Majesty thereof. Nevertheless, I have since\r\nthought that I neglect my duty in failing to send a testimonial to\r\nyour Majesty which was forwarded to this city from Lope de Palacios,\r\ncaptain of the ship \"Sant Martin,\" which went to China. He sent\r\nto this city, asking that he be granted permission to leave Macao,\r\nbecause he feared that they were about to kill him in order to gain\r\npossession of his property. I am the only person who can send this\r\nmemorial to your Majesty, as Lope de Palacios sent it to this city\r\nwith much secrecy, and in the same manner was it given to me. I\r\ndiscussed the matter with the president, saying that we should send\r\nfor the captain as if the idea were our own and he had not requested\r\nit--employing so great secrecy, so that the Portuguese who were here\r\nwould not learn of it; for the same Lope de Palacios had declared that\r\nhe would be certainly put to death if they knew that he was trying\r\nto come here. Nevertheless, the request to send for him was in vain,\r\nand I was moved to forward this testimonial to your Majesty. It states\r\ntherein the great harm done by the viceroy in sending the ship \"San\r\nMartin\" to Macao. As the same person who went to learn the damage gives\r\ntestimony thereof, no witness more worthy of credit can be entered in\r\nthe cause. I am also writing to the viceroy of Nueva España in regard\r\nto the injuries which he wrought on these kingdoms by despatching\r\nthe ship \"San Martin\" to China--although God supplied the remedy,\r\nby the loss of the same ship. I tell him that if that ship had been\r\nsent to this city a more prosperous voyage would have been made than\r\nthe investors could have expected, for so many Chinese merchants came\r\nthis year to this city, that the merchandise was worth nothing; and\r\nif the ship \"San Martin\" had come here a satisfactory and cheap cargo\r\ncould have been obtained, perhaps even in greater quantity than at\r\nMacao. Instead of damaging this city, those persons would have been\r\nenriched, who on account of greed were unable to see the damage done\r\nto all of us. Thus God has punished them all, by depriving them of\r\nthat profit the desire for which had blinded them to their duty.\r\n\r\nThey also say that the ship \"Sant Ana\" was sold for thirty thousand\r\npesos and ordered to make a voyage to Macao. These proceedings also\r\nwere put to confusion by God, through means which have cost us dearly,\r\nnamely the loss, of that vessel. It can be said that if it had been\r\nat Macao somewhat less damage would have been done to these islands\r\nthan in the burning of the ship by the Englishman. As I wrote to\r\nyour Majesty, via Malaca, for ships to go from Mexico to Macao is\r\nto destroy both those kingdoms and these, since the Chinese raise\r\nthe prices of their merchandise to such an extent that Portuguese\r\nand Castilians cannot live. May your Majesty be pleased to order\r\nthe viceroy to hold these lands in somewhat higher estimation,\r\nsince your Majesty considers them (and justly so) worthy of constant\r\nattention. Ever since the viceroy came to Mexico, he has not sent to\r\nthis country any troops (except exiles or criminals), or ammunition,\r\nor the customary supplies for this camp, as wine, flour, and other\r\narticles; he has so reduced everything that there is great privation\r\nhere, and very little profit to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's governor and royal Audiencia in these islands look well\r\nto the service of your Majesty and the good of this country. Will\r\nyour Majesty be pleased to order the viceroy of Nueva España,\r\npresent or future, not to disturb or change what may be decided by\r\nthem? not only in the customs duties, but in the price fixed for\r\neach tonelada, and in the mode of registration. According to our\r\ninformation, the viceroy has changed everything, greatly increasing\r\nthe taxes imposed here. The labors of the citizens in the service of\r\nyour Majesty in these islands should be sufficient without still more\r\nsevere requirements from Nueva España.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year there was great confusion, which still continues,\r\nabout the goods which were brought to this city by your Majesty's\r\nships. The citizens claim that they ought to be preferred to the\r\nmerchants; and the merchants complain that, on account of the cargoes\r\nof the citizens, their merchandise remained here. I understand that on\r\nthis point offenses' against God have been committed, and still more\r\nserious damage may be done--some persons being ruined, as they have\r\nno space in the cargoes for their property--unless it is checked by\r\nyour Majesty commanding what order must be followed in this affair. It\r\nis of exceeding importance for the quiet and content of this city.\r\n\r\nThere are so many Chinese that come to this land that the islands\r\nare full of them. Thereby follows much damage to the natives, as\r\nthe Chinese are a very vicious people, from intercourse with whom no\r\ngood but much harm can be gained. I have tried to have the governors\r\nremedy the matter by commanding that all the Chinese be collected in\r\nthis city. I see no improvement, however; and it is of much importance\r\nthat this be corrected, for the temporal and spiritual good of these\r\nlands. Will your Majesty be pleased to order that this be remedied\r\nby severe measures. May our Lord guard your Majesty many years for\r\nthe good of us who can do but little. At Manila, June 27, 1588.\r\n\r\n_The Bishop of the Filipinas_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments of 1589\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tExcerpt from a letter from the viceroy of India.

Robertson; the seventh,\r\nby Frederic W. Morrison, of Harvard University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcerpt of a Letter from the Viceroy of India\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the things that have seemed most surprising in Don Juan de Gama\r\nis the following. When decrees were published by order of the viceroy;\r\nDon Duarte, [12] in your Majesty's name, prohibiting navigation to\r\nChina and Luçoens [Luzón], which he [Juan de Gama] as captain-general\r\nshould have executed, he did the contrary. Jheronimo Pereira, captain\r\nof the expedition to Japon, had already done likewise; thus those in\r\nauthority, who were under obligation to execute your Majesty's laws\r\nand commands, were the first to break them, to the great scandal\r\nof all. Therefore, as soon as possible, I ordered a remedy for such\r\ndisorders. For this purpose I appointed certain chief magistrates,\r\nwho excused themselves, either through fear of Don Juan or dread of\r\nthe sea. Things came to such a pass that, it was necessary to send by\r\nschooner, outside the monsoon season, the licentiate Ruy Machado who\r\ncame from the kingdom this year, and who had been appointed to that\r\nauditorship; his adjutant was Ynacio Nuñez de Mancelos, the captain of\r\nthe said vessel. The latter had a few soldiers, and is also to remain\r\nas captain of the city, since an order for the voyage will not have\r\narrived from India. I think that these two vessels will suffice in\r\nevery respect for this matter, both to extend the voyage for Don Juan,\r\nand to quiet various disturbances arising in the country, on account\r\nof the navigation from Nueva España. I also hope that everything will\r\nturn out well, and that your Majesty will bestow upon him great favor\r\nand honor for this service alone. Among the despatches brought by the\r\nauditor is a decree ordering, the embarcation for India and Luçoens of\r\nall Castilians, both religious and secular, so that only the original\r\nPortuguese citizens shall remain in Machao. That will do away with\r\nany further occasion for vessels to go there from Nueva España. From\r\nthis last has resulted great injury to your Majesty's vassals in these\r\nregions, to the royal exchequer, and religion itself. Peradventure\r\nthe Castilians were the cause of again closing the door to the\r\npreaching of the gospel, being moved by indiscreet eagerness or too\r\nmuch solicitude. They are so unrestrained in this particular, that, by\r\ntrading in China without your Majesty's permission, they are the first\r\nwho broke your decrees, under pretense of religion itself. No easier\r\nremedy can be applied than preventing them from entering this trade,\r\nwhich your Majesty should have for the advantage of your own service.\r\n\r\nWe might describe here the great inconveniences and hindrances to your\r\nMajesty from a longer continuance of this navigation. But since this\r\nletter will, be despatched by land, and the viceroy Don Duarte has\r\ndescribed these matters so fully, I refrain from doing so here. I say\r\nonly that, even if there were no other reason than not opening the\r\nway to the English and other nations to resort to those regions (as\r\nthey did last year and this) that alone would be sufficient reason\r\nto stop this intercourse entirely. The Englishman Don Thomas, who\r\ncame to these regions lately, has caused us much anxiety here. For\r\nthis reason the people of India are very confident that your Majesty\r\nwill order assistance in this case and apply the fitting remedy,\r\nfor the common good of these states and that of your service.\r\n\r\nDon Thomas, the Englishman, sailed from England with three ships in\r\nthe year 87. Entering the straits of Magallanes, he sailed to the\r\nSouth Seas. Having made some prizes of large and small vessels, he\r\nloaded two of his own vessels and sent them to that kingdom [England]\r\nby the same route. Nearing the Philipinas, he took his course to\r\nJava, and entered the port of Balambuao in Java itself. At that\r\ntime two Portuguese were at that port, who came immediately to the\r\nship thinking it was from India. The Englishman received them well,\r\nand gave them some church ornaments and other valuable articles,\r\ntogether with a letter for the bishop of Malaca and another for the\r\ncaptain, the substance of which was, that he had come to explore\r\nthose regions. From the questions asked these men by the auditor of\r\nMalaca, it was ascertained that the purpose of their coming was none\r\nother than trade, exploration, and prizes. He asked particularly about\r\nAchen, the straits of Meca and Malaca, and their fortifications. It is\r\nthought that this Englishman came especially to explore the channels\r\nof Bale, whence these men said that he would sail in March of this\r\nyear to the island of Sant Lorenzo, from which place he would lay\r\nhis course to the island of Santa Helena, following the course taken\r\nby the Portuguese vessels. Pray God he come not hither again, as an\r\nexample for the daring of others--although the interest they have in\r\ndoing so is so great, that I fear this navigation cannot be stopped\r\nwithout much trouble, and the prohibition of navigation by Castilians\r\nand Portuguese to Nueva España. A blockade will be established again,\r\nso that foreign nations will not undertake this navigation. On this\r\naccount alone, it seems to me that this navigation should always be\r\nrigorously prohibited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Santiago de Vera to Felipe II\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nThis past year of eighty-eight I gave an account to your Majesty of\r\nthe condition of this land. As the voyage is so full of sea-perils\r\nand danger from corsairs, and it is difficult for the despatches\r\nto reach the hands of your Majesty, the duplicate of that letter\r\naccompanies this. Therein is declared the extreme need of the islands\r\nfor reënforcements of troops and necessary supplies for the camp,\r\nand other things, of which I gave an account to your Majesty. They\r\nare most important to the royal service and the preservation of\r\nthis land. I beseech your Majesty to have provision made with all\r\npossible expedition.\r\n\r\nA small ship leaving this port for the city of Malaca carried two\r\ndescalced religious of the order of St. Francis. As the king of Burney\r\nwas at peace with us, they stopped at the port of Mohala which is\r\ntwo leagues from Burney. They visited the king, to whom they gave\r\nmy letters, and were well received by him. He commanded houses to be\r\ngiven them and everything necessary to assure their sustenance. One\r\nnight many people of that kingdom attacked them, among whom, it\r\nis said, there were a brother and other kinsmen of the king. They\r\nkilled three Spaniards, among them one of the religious, and robbed\r\nthem of all their possessions. From those who escaped I learned that\r\nthe assaulting party were people well known in Burney, and that the\r\nspoils were sold publicly in that city. Some articles were seen in\r\nthe possession of the king's kinsmen. I learned that some chiefs of\r\nthese islands had intrigued with that people to secure their aid;\r\nand that they had plotted together to do this, and had agreed to bring\r\nBurney and the kings of Jolo and of Mindanao, and many other foreigners\r\nagainst this city, in order to rob and kill us. As there was a Japanese\r\nship here, they conferred with the captain, and with people who came\r\nfrom that land, all Japanese, proposing that the latter should aid\r\nthem with what they had, and with supplies and everything necessary,\r\nand thus deliver to them this land, in accordance with the plan and\r\narrangements previously agreed upon. So well did they keep this secret,\r\nduring fifteen months while they were awaiting a favorable opportunity,\r\nthat they were not even suspected by myself, or the religious, or any\r\nother person. To accomplish their design, they despatched the chiefs\r\nof these islands to Burney, and to the other kingdoms three chiefs of\r\ntheir number. They wrote to Japon, so that, at the appointed time,\r\nall would come; and all were given orders as to what they were to\r\ndo. I made secret investigations, and found out that all the aforesaid\r\nwas true; and in a short time I had in my hands the guilty ones who\r\nwere in these islands, and also those who had gone away after the\r\ndeath of the people, so that none remained uncaptured. Without any\r\ndisturbance whatever, I beheaded seven of the authors of the rebellion,\r\nsons, nephews, and grandsons of the lords of this land. Others not so\r\nculpable I punished by exile to Nueva España and by other penalties,\r\nso that it now seems that this disturbance is quelled. After that,\r\nin the province of Cubu and in that called the Pintados, the chiefs\r\nheld a conference, and plotted to kill the Spaniards. The majority of\r\nthose who took part in this have been imprisoned, and proceedings are\r\nbeing instituted against them. I think that this will cause us but\r\nlittle trouble. This boldness is caused by the natives noticing the\r\nfewness of Spanish troops in the islands and the few reënforcements\r\nsent from Nueva España. It is necessary that your Majesty should\r\norder that there be less negligence in this respect.\r\n\r\nBy a royal decree your Majesty commands me to sell the magistracies\r\nof this city and four offices of notaries-public therein; also those\r\nof the provinces of Oton, Cebu, Camarines, Ylocos, Cagayan, Panpanga,\r\nand Bonbon. As the land is so newly settled, and the offices of so\r\nlittle profit, I wrote to your Majesty that, in my opinion, it was\r\nnot time to dispose of them, and that they would bring but little if\r\noffered at auction; but that, if anyone would buy them at a reasonable\r\nprice, I would sell them. This I did, and in order to enhance their\r\nvalue at the sale, I announced that the offices could be renounced and\r\nsold by paying to your Majesty the third part of the price they were\r\nworth. As the offices of notary have been sold, will your Majesty\r\nbe pleased to provide that this condition be observed; or, if not,\r\nthat the price be returned to them and the offices be sold without\r\nthis condition--as the perquisites and influence of these offices are\r\nheld in such esteem in this land, that they have risen to very good\r\nprices. The bids for the first of the magistracies that were commanded\r\nto be sold closed at one thousand two hundred and fifty-one pesos;\r\nand for the second, third, fourth, and fifth, at two thousand eight\r\nhundred. The four offices of notary-public of this city brought two\r\nthousand eight hundred and eighty pesos, at seven hundred and twenty\r\npesos each. That of the province of Panpanga brought one thousand;\r\nof Oton, one thousand six hundred and twenty; that of the city and\r\nprovince of Cubu, five hundred and sixty; of Ylocos, three hundred\r\npesos; and that of Bombon, two hundred and sixty-two pesos. The other\r\nmagistracies and offices of notary-public which were offered at auction\r\ndid not bring so high a price, as the stubbornness and competitions\r\nwhich had caused the offices to rise so in value had ceased. For\r\nthis reason the remaining magistracies and offices of notary-public\r\nhave not been sold. I shall give an account to your Majesty, later,\r\nof whatever is done with regard to them, and the sum they bring will\r\nbe placed in the royal treasury as soon as it is collected. [_Marginal\r\nnote_: \"Write to the governor that, in what refers to the offices of\r\nregidor, it is not expedient that there be the condition permitting\r\nthem to renounce the offices. The sales must be made in the usual\r\nway. As regards the notarial offices, what has been done is approved.\"]\r\n\r\nOn this route to Nueva España your Majesty has four ships, and the\r\nnew one that has just been finished, and which makes the voyage this\r\nyear. Of these, the viceroy of Nueva España sold the ship \"San Martin,\"\r\nto make the voyage to Macan, where it was wrecked and burned by the\r\nChinese. Another was taken by the English corsair, as I reported to\r\nyour Majesty; and but now when another, in the port of this city,\r\nwas ready to make the voyage, so great a hurricane burst on this and\r\nmany other Spanish and Chinese ships that only a small boat was left\r\nunwrecked. Of the two remaining, only one is available; the other\r\ncannot be used, as it is so old. Understanding the great need there\r\nwas of ships, I had a large galleon of six hundred toneladas, which\r\nhad been built in the Pintados Islands, placed in the shipyards of\r\nyour Majesty, for the above-named route. God willing, it may sail in\r\nthe year ninety-one. I have given orders for private persons to make\r\ntwo other ships of less tonnage. One is already finished, and both\r\nwill be able to sail next year. It is most important that there be\r\nfor this navigation plenty of ships, both for the emergencies of war\r\nwhich may arise, and for the preservation of these islands, which are\r\nsupported by trade. If, as I have suggested several times before, your\r\nMajesty were pleased to have about ten thousand pesos sent annually\r\nfrom Nueva España, two ships of good capacity can be launched very\r\neasily, without harassing the natives in any way--and with this\r\nhelp, at even less than a third of the cost elsewhere. Otherwise,\r\nthere is no way to bring it about. Your Majesty will signify your\r\nroyal pleasure in this. [_Marginal note_: \"Write to the governor to\r\nproceed with and carry out this plan, and to give orders for private\r\npersons to build ships.\"]\r\n\r\nFor the ships sailing between these islands and Nueva España,\r\nand to other places which may be found, sailors are much needed,\r\nto navigate them and to remain here to look after them; also\r\ncarpenters and calkers who must reside here to repair them. They\r\nshould be paid in Nueva España as this treasury is too poor. As the\r\nmoney for their wages must be sent, sometimes it is not brought,\r\nand at other times it is lost, thereby causing the sailors to die of\r\nstarvation. Therefore the sailors serve half-heartedly, and desert;\r\nand there is great negligence in the despatch of the fleets. The only\r\nremedy for both these evils is from the exchequer of your Majesty. If\r\nit is to be spent therefor, it would be best for your Majesty to have\r\nthe amount of the freight-charges on the property sent from these\r\nislands in the said ships granted annually to this royal treasury\r\nup to the sum of three thousand pesos. Thus the needs here will be\r\nmet without taking from the treasury of Mexico. [_Marginal note_:\r\n\"A decree in accordance herewith. Meanwhile order shall not be given\r\nthat the ships of this line shall sail at his Majesty's cost.\"]\r\n\r\nI have already reported to your Majesty the removal from these forts\r\nof a quantity of artillery, for the security of the two ships which\r\nI despatched to Nueva España last year, eighty-eight. That carried by\r\none of the ships is paid for by the merchants, as well as the powder,\r\narms, and ammunition; and that on the other was at your Majesty's\r\nexpense. Part of the money received I sent to the kingdom of China\r\nin order to buy what metal could be obtained. Thence they brought\r\nme one hundred and twenty-five picos [13] (about five arrobas) of\r\ncopper, at thirteen pesos and eight rreals. With this artillery is\r\nbeing cast; to take the place of the pieces carried by the ships,\r\nI had others cast from the metal which I had here. The results are\r\nvery good. Bronze is so cheap in China, and so easy to transport\r\nand cast in this country, that, if your Majesty will have money\r\nsent hither from Nueva España for this purpose, artillery could\r\nbe provided in this country both for Nueva España and Piru. Will\r\nyour Majesty signify the royal pleasure in this. [_Marginal note_:\r\n\"Write to the viceroy of Nueva España that this seems expedient, and\r\nthat he may send money to the governor, in order that some artillery\r\nmay be made there, both for Nueva España and Peru. Advice as to what\r\nis needed must be given to the viceroy of Peru.\"]\r\n\r\nThe trade with the Chinese is continually increasing in these\r\nislands. About four thousand men of that land are here as a general\r\nrule, including merchants and workmen. These become citizens and settle\r\nin the alcaiceria [silk-market] of this city. In the surrounding\r\nvillages there are also a large number of Chinese. Their houses are\r\nbeing rapidly built of stone, according to the Spanish custom. They\r\nare very strong, large and imposing in appearance. In two or three\r\nyears, God willing, all the buildings will be erected, as also the\r\ncathedral church, the monasteries, and other churches. They are being\r\nbuilt very substantially and some are already finished. The materials\r\nare so good and the workmen, both Chinese and natives, so numerous,\r\nthat everyone is encouraged to build the houses in this manner. But\r\nit is a melancholy fact (for it all is like an empty purse, or an\r\ninn without a guest) that the land is unhealthful, and there are no\r\ndoctors or medicines; and so there is great lack of troops, and of\r\nmen for the usual work of guard and sentinel-duty, and for expeditions\r\nto carry succor to the settlements and to pacify the uprisings of the\r\nIndians. The soldiers are constantly dying and passing away, in such\r\nnumber that I fear there will be no troops to defend the city from any\r\nof the many enemies by whom we are surrounded. For the remedy thereof,\r\nwill your Majesty be pleased to have the viceroy of Nueva España send\r\nthe troops, arms, and ammunition which may be requested by the governor\r\nof these islands, and also the medicines and supplies necessary for\r\nthe camp. It has been three years since we have had any kind of aid\r\nwhatever, and consequently we are in extreme necessity. I beseech\r\nyour Majesty, if you wish these islands to be preserved, that you will\r\nexpressly command the said viceroy to send reënforcements annually to\r\nthis camp, of two hundred men, with powder and ammunition; medicines,\r\nand other supplies for the hospitals; and whatever the governor may\r\nadvise is necessary. I can assure your Majesty that if this succor\r\nfail, everything else will fail also, and everything gained by your\r\nMajesty at so great and excessive expenses, in order to start on the\r\nway to heaven so many millions of souls who had been dominated by the\r\ndevil, will be lost. Thus will be closed the door of this new world\r\nwhich has been opened by your Majesty. [_Marginal note_: \"Write to\r\nthe governor that he continue the building. To Don Luis de Velasco,\r\nthat he observe this command, and aid the settlements.\"]\r\n\r\nThe fort which, as I had written to your Majesty, was being built, was\r\nshaken, when about completed, in three places by great earthquakes. It\r\nopened in one place more than a finger's breadth, although less in the\r\nothers. To assure its safety and construct it in the modern style,\r\nalthough it was quite sufficiently strong before, I am constructing\r\ncavaliers which are to serve as buttresses for it. The principal part,\r\nthat toward the sea, is finished; the other parts are commenced, and,\r\nGod helping, will soon be completed. These will make it so capacious\r\nand strong that it can withstand any attack. I am sending the model,\r\nreport, and account herewith to your Majesty. _[Marginal note_:\r\n\"Let it be brought.\"]\r\n\r\nSince coming to this country, I have insisted that the religious\r\nshould try to learn the Chinese language, in order to convert and\r\nteach the Chinese in this land, who are ordinarily about as many as I\r\nbefore stated. As it is so difficult and the religious are so busily\r\nengaged with the natives of the islands, they have not done this. When\r\nthe Dominicans came here, I entrusted to them the instruction of\r\nthe Chinese, and supplied them with interpreters to teach them the\r\nlanguage. I bade them build a church and dwelling in the alcaiceria\r\n(called the Parian); and at the point of Tondo, where the Chinese live\r\nand carry on their trade. Two of the religious have been so apt that\r\none of them already understands and speaks that language well, and the\r\nother will know it in a short time. They are preaching and teaching and\r\nhave converted many people, having now a village of Christians. This\r\nyear, on Holy Thursday they held a procession in honor of the blood\r\nof Christ, wherein they displayed much devotion. I hope in our Lord\r\nthat, as this people so clearly and firmly understand what they learn,\r\nand as they have no particular worship, in a short time they will all\r\nbe converted. It is certain that if their long hair were not cut off\r\nwhen they are baptized (according to the bishop's commands), there\r\nwould already have been a general conversion in this land, and they\r\nwould have received baptism. I gave account thereof to your Majesty,\r\nand await your orders. [_Marginal note_: \"Write to the provincial\r\nacknowledging this, and to the bishop \"in regard to cutting off the\r\nhair of the Chinese. This is not expedient, as their conversion is\r\nthereby retarded. Moreover, they do not dare to return to their own\r\ncountry where they could teach and convert others. This custom of the\r\nChinese, wearing their hair long, is more usual in other parts of\r\nthe Yndias, as he knows; and hitherto this has not been considered\r\nunseemly. Let the bishop call together the superiors of the orders,\r\nand other learned and zealous persons. They shall confer and give\r\ncommands for what is expedient in regard to suitable measures for the\r\nconversion of the Chinese. He shall send advices thereof, and of the\r\ndifficulties in the way, and shall provide for both.\"]\r\n\r\nThe bishop of these islands, as I have at other times written to\r\nyour Majesty, does not countenance appeals made by force, and the\r\ndecrees of the Audiencia; and when he is so inclined, he refuses to\r\ncomply therewith. We have therefore been put to much annoyance and\r\nconstraint in enforcing exile and other penalties, particularly in\r\nregard to the defense of the royal jurisdiction. This latter has\r\nnot been done because the land is new, and to avoid offending the\r\nnatives. He becomes very angry at times, with little or no occasion,\r\nso that he often disagrees with the Audiencia, in the pulpit and out of\r\nit, and causes others to do the same--notwithstanding what your Majesty\r\nhas commanded, and the reprimands that he has received. Although there\r\nhave been serious difficulties, I do not discuss them, in order not\r\nto weary your Majesty with a longer account. I beseech your Majesty to\r\nsupply the remedy which you think suitable, and to order the bishop not\r\nto publish, without reason, as he has done, causes of the Holy Office\r\nagainst the Audiencia and fiscal. Although we must always do justice,\r\nand the fiscal must act as plaintiff, there is caused much scandal and\r\nmany hindrances to the authority of your Majesty's Audiencia, by trying\r\nto disgrace and intimidate the judges by threats of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nAlthough your Majesty has ordered this camp and the royal hospitals to\r\nbe provided with medicines and other necessities, as there is no doctor\r\nthe soldiers are only treated by unskilled surgeons who attempt to cure\r\nthem. For this reason many people die, and I beseech your Majesty,\r\nas it so important to your service, to order the viceroy of Nueva\r\nEspaña to send a good physician with an adequate salary at the cost\r\nof your royal estate. The city has no money with which to pay him,\r\nnor do the soldiers, since even the richest of them has not enough\r\nfor his own support. _[Marginal note_: \"Write to the viceroy of Nueva\r\nEspaña to send a doctor and a surgeon to treat these people and give\r\nadvice thereof.\"]\r\n\r\nAt the shipyard of these islands your Majesty's chief shipbuilder\r\nand superintendent of work was Master Miguel de Palacio. He died and\r\nhis place was filled by Master Marco, a good builder of all kinds of\r\nships. He died also; and although I understand there is another now in\r\ncharge of the galleon which is being built in the Pintados, he is old\r\nand cannot all alone attend to the work, to the repairing of the ships\r\nof the line, and the building of others. There is great need of another\r\ngood officer. I beseech your Majesty to order that, if possible, men\r\nbe sent for this from the kingdoms of Nueva España. [_Marginal note:\r\n\"Idem.\"_]\r\n\r\nIn the relation written by the Audiencia are other matters, of which\r\nI give no account here, since they are there mentioned; your Majesty\r\nwill please order that these be examined. May God preserve the Catholic\r\nperson of your Majesty. At Manila, July 13 of the year 1589.\r\n\r\nThe doctor _Santiago de Vera_\r\n\r\n[_Endorsed_: \"Provision is made for the within; let the governor\r\nbe informed.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConspiracy Against the Spaniards\r\n\r\n\r\n_Testimony in certain investigations made by Doctor Santiago de Vera,\r\npresident of the Philipinas_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the city of Manila, on the twentieth of May in the year one thousand\r\nfive hundred and eighty-nine. Doctor Santiago de Vera, of the Council\r\nof the king, our lord, and his governor and captain-general in these\r\nPhilipinas Islands, stated that inasmuch as it is proper and necessary\r\nto inform the king our sovereign of the compact and conspiracy which\r\nthe Indian chiefs and natives of these islands and the vicinity of\r\nManila had plotted against the service of God, our Lord, and against\r\nhis Majesty, and of the inquiry and investigations made thus far in\r\norder to ascertain and verify the facts, and the status of the case:\r\nhe therefore would order, and he did order, Estevan de Marquina,\r\nnotary-public of Manila--before whom most of the trial has been\r\nconducted, of which an account has already been given three times to\r\nthe royal Audiencia--to draw up an attested record of the said trial\r\nin a summary and relation, or such documents as shall be necessary,\r\nin order to send them to the royal Council of the Indias this present\r\nyear. He also ordered him to inform his Majesty of what is occurring,\r\nand of what has been done about the matter. This was what Doctor\r\nSantiago de Vera declared, ordered, and signed.\r\n\r\nBy order of his Lordship:\r\n\r\n_Thomas Perez_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fulfilment of the command and decree of Doctor Santiago de Vera,\r\ngovernor and captain-general of these islands, and president of the\r\nroyal Audiencia, I, Estevan de Marquina, notary-public for the king our\r\nsovereign, of the number [authorized] in the city of Manila, testify\r\nthat a trial and criminal process has been conducted and is still\r\npending before the said governor and captain-general. The parties are\r\nthe royal department of justice of the one part, and certain Indian\r\nchiefs, natives of the villages of Tondo, Misilo, Bulacan, and other\r\nvillages in the neighborhood of Manila, of the other part. The cause\r\nof this contention seems to be that on the twenty-sixth of October\r\nof last year, one thousand five hundred and eighty-eight, Doctor\r\nSantiago de Vera, governor and captain-general of these islands,\r\nand president of the royal Audiencia, learned that the following\r\npersons: Don Agustin de Legaspi, one of the chiefs of this land;\r\nMartin Panga, governor of the village of Tondo, and his first cousin;\r\nMagat Salamat, the son of the old lord of this land; and other chiefs,\r\nhad not long ago sent a present of weapons and other articles to the\r\nking of Burney, and that they were quite intent upon holding meetings\r\nand their usual drunken feasts, swearing to keep secret whatever they\r\ndiscussed. He also learned that they had sold and were selling their\r\nlanded property. In order to ascertain what the condition of affairs\r\nis, the governor made an inquiry and many witnesses were summoned. From\r\nthis inquiry and other investigations and inquests made in the course\r\nof the trials, it appears that the said Don Agustin de Legaspi and\r\nMagat Salamat had sent a quantity of shields, arquebuses, and other\r\nweapons to Xapon and to the petty king of Burney, who has thus been\r\nenabled to put himself on a war-footing. They warned these powers to\r\nfortify themselves in their strongholds, because the Spaniards intended\r\nto go there. They added that the said Don Agustin would notify them in\r\nperson of what was taking place; and that, for this purpose, he would\r\nask permission to set out on his commercial enterprises. Likewise\r\nwe learned that the people of the kingdom of Burney were thinking of\r\nmanning a fleet for the purpose of attacking the Spaniards; and that\r\nthey had killed a Franciscan friar and other Spaniards while on their\r\nway to Malaca from Manila with messages and despatches for the king,\r\nour sovereign. It appears that on the fourth of November of the said\r\nyear, when the inquiry had not gone further than this, Captain Pedro\r\nSarmiento arrived in this city from the Calamianes, which are islands\r\nnear Burney; and brought the news and information that he had left\r\nbehind in the said Calamianes three Indian chiefs of Tondo, namely,\r\nMagat Salamat, Don Agustin Manuguit, son of Don Phelipe Salalila, and\r\nDon Joan Banal, brother-in-law of the said Magat. Through Don Antonio\r\nSurabao, his servant and chief of his encomienda, he had learned that\r\nthese men were going as ambassadors to the petty king of Burney, in\r\norder to induce him to send a fleet to attack the Spaniards, and to\r\njoin the chiefs of Jolo, and Sumaelob, chief of Cuyo, who had already\r\ncome to terms and offered to help them with two thousand men. They had\r\npersuaded the said Don Antonio Surabao to accompany them and carry\r\nout their plans; but the latter while on the one hand he promised\r\nto help them, in order not to arouse their suspicion, on the other\r\nhand unfolded the plan to Captain Sarmiento. He added, moreover,\r\nthat Amarlangagui, chief of Baibai, who was within the jurisdiction\r\nof Manila and held the office of master-of-artillery, had told him,\r\nwhile in this city, that all the chiefs of this neighborhood had\r\nplotted and conspired with the Borneans to rebel against the service\r\nof the king our sovereign, and to kill the Spaniards of this city,\r\nwhile they were off their guard. The plan was that when the fleet\r\nof Burney reached the port of Cavite, and the Spaniards trustfully\r\ncalled these chiefs to their aid, they would all immediately enter\r\nthe houses of the Spaniards with their men, fortify themselves in\r\nthem and thus take possession of them one by one. If the Spaniards\r\ntook refuge in the fortress, Indian soldiers would follow them; and,\r\nbeing two to one, they would surely kill the Spaniards. Maluco offered\r\nan example of this; for with but few people they had taken so large a\r\nfortress from the Portuguese. To this end the people of Burney were\r\nbuilding seven galleys and other warships, and were getting ready\r\nammunition and war-material. Thus it is affirmed by the said Don\r\nAntonio Surabao himself, who says that, under the pledge of friendship\r\nand secrecy, he was made acquainted with all this, and was persuaded\r\nto join the said conspiracy. Upon this, with the governor's approval,\r\nsoldiers and attendants were immediately despatched with his orders to\r\narrest the said chiefs, and to bring them to this city as quickly as\r\npossible. From the inquiry and secret investigations which were taken\r\nup anew, it appears that last year, five hundred and eighty-seven,\r\nwhen Captain Don Joan Gayo and many Japanese with merchandise arrived\r\nat this city in a ship from Xapon, Don Agustin de Legaspi became\r\nvery friendly to him, inviting him many times to eat and drink at\r\nhis house which is on the other side of the river of this city. The\r\nagreement and stipulation which he made with Don Joan Gayo through\r\nthe Japanese interpreter, Dionisio Fernandez, and in the presence of\r\nthe said Magat Salamat, Don Agustin Manuguit, Don Phelipe Salalila,\r\nhis father, and Don Geronimo Bassi, Don Agustin de Legaspi's brother,\r\nwas, that the said captain should come to this city with soldiers from\r\nXapon, and enter it under pretext of peace and commerce, bringing in\r\nhis ship flags for the use of the Spaniards, so that the latter should\r\nthink his intentions peaceful. It was also agreed that the chiefs\r\nof the neighborhood would help them to kill the Spaniards, and would\r\nsupply the provisions and everything necessary. The said Don Agustin\r\nde Legaspi was to set out to meet them; and, in order that they might\r\nrecognize one another, he would carry some of the weapons which the\r\nsaid captain had given him. After they had conquered the Spaniards,\r\nthey would make him [Don Agustin] king of the land, and collect the\r\ntribute from the natives, which would be divided between Don Agustin\r\nand the Japanese. They swore this after their fashion, by anointing\r\ntheir necks with a broken egg. Don Agustin de Legaspi discussed and\r\narranged the whole plan with Amaghicon, an Indian chief of Navotas,\r\nwarned him to keep the secret, and gave him some of the weapons which\r\nthe Japanese had given him, in order that they might recognize one\r\nanother. According to the declarations of Dionisio Fernandez, the\r\nJapanese interpreter, Don Phelipe Salalila, Don Geronimo Basi, Magat\r\nSalamat, and other witnesses who were present at the said meetings and\r\ncompacts, and as it appears also from the trial and investigations,\r\nit seems that when Don Martin Panga, under the charge of adultery,\r\nDon Agustin de Legaspi, for accounts demanded of him at the time when\r\nhe was governor of Tondo, Don Gabriel Tuambaçan, Don Francisco Acta,\r\nhis son, and Pitongatan were taken to the prison of this court, each\r\nand every one of them swore, after their fashion, to help one another\r\nwith their persons and property in all matters--be it concerning the\r\nliberty of their slaves, or in any other difficulty.\r\n\r\nLikewise it appears that after they left the said prison, the said\r\nDon Martin Panga was exiled from the village of Tondo for a certain\r\nperiod, and went to live in the village of Tambobo, not far from this\r\ncity. There he and Don Agustin de Legaspi invited the other leaders to\r\ncome together for a secret meeting. Under pretext of visiting said Don\r\nMartin Panga, a meeting was held in the said village by Don Phelipe\r\nSalalila, Don Agustin Manuguit; Magat Salamat, chief of Tondo; Don\r\nPedro Bolingui, chief of Pandaca; Don Geronimo Basi and Don Grabiel\r\nTuam Basar, Don Agustin's brothers; Don Luis Amanicalao and Calao\r\nhis son; the brothers Don Dionisio Capolo and Don Phelipe Salonga;\r\nDon Phelipe Amarlangagui, chief of Catangalan; Don Francisco Acta and\r\nAmaghicon; with other Indian timaguas, servants, and allies of his. For\r\nthree days they met, and drank after their fashion. During this time\r\nthey resolved to act in harmony and with one mind in everything. If\r\ntheir slaves demanded liberty, they were to help one another against\r\nthem; for already they were not regarded or obeyed as before. They\r\npossessed neither slaves nor gold, and found themselves poor and\r\ncast down, ready to go to prison any day. Their sorrow was very keen\r\nbecause their wives were being taken away from them, and given to\r\nothers to whom, they claimed, they had been first married. For all\r\nthese reasons they were very sad, and they discussed and plotted,\r\nand took oath, according to their custom, that if an enemy came to\r\nManila to attack the Spaniards, they would unanimously and with one\r\nmind aid the enemy against the Spaniards. Thus they would once more\r\nbecome masters, as they had been before, and exercise the old tyranny\r\nover the common people--who now were much favored by the Spaniards,\r\nbeing promoted to superior places by them. The said Don Agustin de\r\nLegaspi proposed to them the plan and compact which he had made with\r\nthe said Japanese Don Joan Payo [Gayo]; and the other chiefs declared\r\nthat they were ready to help him and to accede to his wishes.\r\n\r\nAfter this, it appears that in the month of February, one thousand\r\nfive hundred and eighty-eight, when we heard of the English pirate\r\nwho passed through these islands and plundered the ship \"Santana,\"\r\nthe said chiefs made preparations, thinking he would come to this city,\r\nto carry out their plan.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward, Don Estevan Taes, chief of Bulacan, came to\r\nthe village of Tondo where they were. He conferred with Don Martin\r\nPanga; and they decided that since the Englishman had not come, and\r\nthe compact made at the meeting of Tambobo had not been carried out,\r\nthey should call another meeting to discuss what had been planned at\r\nthe former one. To this end, he offered to notify and call together\r\nall the chiefs from his village as far as Tondo, while Don Martin\r\nPanga was to summon the other chiefs as far as Cavite. To this end,\r\nthe said Don Martin Panga said that he would carry a letter to the\r\ngovernors of Malolos and Guiguinto, and tell them to hasten to the\r\nmeeting; and that, when they were assembled, he could communicate\r\nto them the bad or the good which he kept within his breast. After\r\nDon Esteban Tael [_sic_] had told him to leave the matter in his\r\nhands, Don Martin Panga declared, in the presence of Pitongatan,\r\nthat he and Don Agustin had planned to call together the men of La\r\nLaguna and Comitan; and that, when the people were all gathered,\r\nthey would discuss the means of regaining the freedom and lordship\r\nwhich their fathers had enjoyed before them; and, with all the people\r\ncollected at Tondo, would attack Manila, as arranged with Balaya,\r\nchief of Vangos, and with the natives of Batan. It seems that the\r\nsaid meeting did not take place, on account of various occupations\r\nwhich detained the said chiefs. Moreover it appears that about the\r\nsame time, when certain Indian chiefs of Panpanga came to Manila on\r\nbusiness connected with their province, on passing through the village\r\nof Tondo, Don Agustin Panga summoned them; and he, together with\r\nDon Agustin de Legaspi, Sagat Malagat, and Amanicalao, talked with\r\nthem, and inquired after the business that took them to Manila. The\r\nchiefs answered that they came to entreat the governor to command the\r\ncessation of the lawsuits concerning slaves in Panpanga, until they\r\ncould gather in the harvest. Don Martin said that this was very good,\r\nand that they also wished to make the same entreaty and to bring their\r\nslaves to court; but that to attain this it would be best to assemble\r\nand choose a leader from among them, whom they should swear to obey\r\nin everything as a king, in order that none should act alone. The\r\nchiefs of Panpanga said that they had [no] war with the Spaniards,\r\nto cause them to plot against the latter, and that they had a good\r\nking. Thus they did not consent to what was asked from them by the\r\naforesaid chiefs, and proceeded to Manila in order to transact their\r\nbusiness. In Manila they were again invited to go to Tondo, to take\r\nfood with the plotters; but the Panpanga chiefs refused. On the same\r\nday a meeting was held in Tondo by Don Agustin de Legaspi and Don\r\nMartin Panga; Don Luis Balaya, chief of Bangos; Agustin Lea and Alonso\r\nDigma, his nephews; Don Phelipe Salalila and Don Agustin Manuguit, his\r\nson; Don Luis Amanicalao, and Calao, his son; Don Grabiel Tuambacar,\r\nDon Francisco Acta, Don Phelipe Salonga, and other natives who rendered\r\nservice. While they were thus assembled, they all resolved and agreed,\r\namid the usual drinking, that the abovementioned Magat should go to the\r\nCalamianes and from that place notify the Borneans to come to Manila\r\nto attack the Spaniards; and the chiefs would wait for them here,\r\nand would take care to receive and help them. In fulfilment of this,\r\nthe said chief Magat Salamat went to the Calamianes, which are near the\r\nkingdom of Burney, taking with him the chiefs Don Agustin Manuguit and\r\nDon Joan Banal. Thence he went to the island of Cuyo, where it seems\r\nthat he discussed the matter with Sumaelob, chief of the said island,\r\nand persuaded him to come with the Borneans to plunder Manila. At\r\nthat time he was arrested for this trial, was brought to this city,\r\nand openly confessed that what has been said actually occurred.\r\n\r\nThe said inquiries and investigations made in reference to the\r\ntrial of the aforesaid persons were examined by the governor and\r\ncaptain-general; and he gave orders to arrest those who appeared\r\nguilty, in the various regions and provinces in which they were\r\nto be found, and on different days, letting no one of the guilty\r\nones escape. The men were arrested and their confessions were taken\r\ndown separately. At the proper time and place they were each charged\r\nwith the crime which resulted against each of them; and a copy of the\r\ncharge was given to them and to their attorneys on their behalf. Their\r\ncases were received on trial in a certain order and for a certain\r\nperiod, so as to give them, during that period, an opportunity of\r\nclearing themselves from the charge. The time expired, and the trial\r\nwas definitely closed. The governor and captain-general reviewed the\r\ntrial, and on different days pronounced a final sentence against each\r\none of them, according to their guilt. The sentence is in substance\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nDon Agustin de Legaspi and Don Martin Panga, as leaders and chiefs, and\r\nbeing convicted by witnesses, were condemned to be dragged and hanged;\r\ntheir heads were to be cut off and exposed on the gibbet in iron cages,\r\nas an example and warning against the said crime. All their goods\r\nwere to be confiscated and set apart, half for the royal treasury\r\nand half for judicial expenses. The above-mentioned appealed from\r\nthe aforesaid sentence to the royal Audiencia of these islands; but\r\nafter having examined the trial, the Audiencia confirmed the aforesaid\r\nsentence, and returned the case to the governor and captain-general\r\nin order that justice might be done. The death-punishment was to cut\r\ntheir heads off and to expose them on the gibbet in iron cages. The\r\nsites of their houses were to be plowed and sown with salt. All their\r\nproperty, after the judicial expenses had been defrayed, should be\r\nset aside for the royal treasury. This sentence was executed upon\r\nthe abovementioned persons as here stated.\r\n\r\nDionisio Fernandez, Japanese interpreter in the negotiations with\r\nXapon, having confessed and having been convicted, was condemned to\r\nbe hanged and to lose his property, half of it to be set aside for\r\nthe royal treasury and half for judicial expenses. He appealed from\r\nthis sentence to the royal Audiencia; but this court, after it had\r\nexamined the trial, returned it to the governor and captain-general,\r\nin order that justice might be done. The sentence was executed upon\r\nhim as here stated.\r\n\r\nDon Pedro Balinguit, chief of the village of Pandaca, was sentenced to\r\nsix years of prescribed exile in Nueva España, and was condemned to\r\npay six taes of orejeras gold [14] for the treasury of the king our\r\nsovereign, and for judicial expenses. The fiscal and he appealed to\r\nhis Majesty's chamber--I mean to the royal Audiencia--and this court\r\nreturned the case to the captain-general, so that justice might be\r\ndone. This man is about to sail in these ships for his place of exile.\r\n\r\nPitongatan, chief of the village of Tondo, was sentenced to exile in\r\nNueva España for eight years. His property was to be equally divided\r\nbetween the treasury of the king, our sovereign, and the judicial\r\nexpenses. He and the fiscal appealed to the royal Audiencia; and this\r\ncourt on a second examination sentenced him to exile in such place\r\nas the governor should choose, for two years--one prescribed and the\r\nother unconditioned--and to pay costs only.\r\n\r\nDon Phelipe Salonga, chief of the village of Polo, was sentenced to\r\nexile in Nueva España for six years. Half of his property was to be\r\nset aside for the treasury of the king, our sovereign, and half for\r\njudicial expenses. He and the fiscal appealed to the royal Audiencia;\r\nbut the case was returned to the captain-general, in order that\r\njustice might be done.\r\n\r\nDon Phelipe Amarlangagui, chief of Catangalan, was sentenced to\r\nexile from his village for six years, to a place prescribed. His\r\nproperty was to be divided equally between the treasury of the king,\r\nour sovereign, and the judicial expenses. He and the fiscal appealed to\r\nthe royal Audiencia; but the case was returned to the captain-general,\r\nin order that justice might be done, except that the exile was to be\r\nfor four years.\r\n\r\nDaulat, chief of the village of Castilla, was sentenced to prescribed\r\nexile from this district for four years, and condemned to pay ten taes\r\nof orejeras gold, half for the royal treasury and half for judicial\r\nexpenses. He and the fiscal appealed to the royal Audiencia; but\r\nthe case was returned to the captain-general, in order that justice\r\nmight be done, except that of the four years of exile two were to be\r\nprescribed and two unconditioned.\r\n\r\nDon Joan Basi, chief and former governor of the village of Tagui,\r\nwas sentenced to prescribed exile from this jurisdiction [15] for\r\nfour years. Half of his property was set aside for the treasury of\r\nhis Majesty, and half for the judicial expenses. He and the fiscal\r\nappealed to the royal Audiencia, whence the case was remitted to the\r\ncaptain-general, with the exception that the whole penalty should\r\nconsist only of two years of prescribed exile.\r\n\r\nDionisio Capolo, chief of Candava, was sentenced to prescribed exile\r\nfrom this jurisdiction for eight years, and was condemned to pay\r\nfifteen taes of orejeras gold, half of which was to be set aside\r\nfor the treasury of his Majesty, and half for judicial expenses. He\r\nand the fiscal appealed to the royal Audiencia, which, after having\r\nexamined the report of the trial, remitted it to the captain-general,\r\nin order that justice might be done--save that the whole penalty\r\nwas to consist of four years of prescribed exile, and the payment of\r\ntwelve taes of orejeras gold. The sentence was executed.\r\n\r\nDon Francisco Acta, chief of Tondo, was sentenced to four years of\r\nprescribed exile. Half of his goods and property was to be divided\r\nbetween the treasury of his Majesty and judicial expenses. He and the\r\nfiscal appealed to the court of his Majesty; but the case was remitted\r\nto the captain-general in order that justice might be done--save that\r\nthe whole penalty was to consist of four years' prescribed exile,\r\nand nothing more.\r\n\r\nDon Luis Amanicalao was sentenced to prescribed exile from this\r\njurisdiction for six years. His goods were to be divided between the\r\ntreasury of his Majesty and the judicial expenses. He and the attorney\r\nappealed to the royal Audiencia, but the case was likewise remitted\r\nto the captain-general in order that justice might be done--only that\r\nthe exile was to be reduced to three years. The sentence was executed.\r\n\r\nDon Grabiel Tuambacar, chief of Tondo, was sentenced to exile from\r\nthis jurisdiction for four years, and was condemned to pay six taes\r\nof orejeras gold--half for the treasury of his Majesty, and half for\r\nthe judicial expenses. He appealed to the royal Audiencia, as did the\r\nfiscal also; but the case was remitted to the governor, in order that\r\nhe might execute justice upon him--except that the penalty was to be\r\nonly four years' exile.\r\n\r\nCalao, chief of Tondo, was sentenced to exile from this jurisdiction\r\nfor four years. Half of his goods were to be applied as in other\r\ncases. He and the fiscal appealed to the royal Audiencia, whence\r\nthe case was returned to the captain-general, in order that he might\r\nexecute justice--except that the only penalty was four years' exile.\r\n\r\nOmaghicon, chief of Navotas, was sentenced to prescribed exile in\r\nNueva España for six years, and was condemned to pay sixty taes of\r\norejeras gold, half of it to be set aside for the treasury of his\r\nMajesty, and half for the judicial expenses. This money was to be paid\r\nwithin a month, under pain of hanging. The fiscal of his Majesty and\r\nthe culprit appealed to the royal Audiencia; there the sentence was\r\nrevoked, and the guilty man was condemned to die, and to lose half of\r\nhis goods, the latter to be applied as specified above. Thus he was\r\ncondemned on a new trial, and put to death; and inquiries are being\r\nmade about his goods.\r\n\r\nDon Geronimo Bassi was sentenced to exile in Nueva España for ten\r\nyears. His property was to be divided between the treasury of his\r\nMajesty and the judicial expenses. He and the fiscal of his Majesty\r\nappealed to the royal Audiencia--which, after an examination and a\r\nnew trial, revoked the sentence and condemned him to death, and to\r\nthe loss of all his goods in favor of the royal treasury. The sentence\r\nwas executed.\r\n\r\nDon Phelipe Salalila, chief of Misilo, was exiled to Nueva España for\r\ntwelve years, and condemned to pay seventy taes of gold _de orejeras_,\r\nof which half was to be set aside for the treasury of his Majesty\r\nand half for judicial expenses. He was to pay the money within twenty\r\ndays under pain of death. He and the attorney of his Majesty appealed\r\nto the royal Audiencia--which, after an examination and a new trial,\r\nrevoked the sentence and condemned him to death, and to the loss of\r\nall his goods in favor of the treasury of his Majesty. The sentence\r\nwas executed upon him.\r\n\r\nDon Esteban Taes, chief of Bulacan, was sentenced to prescribed\r\nexile in Nueva España for eight years, and condemned to pay sixty\r\ntaes of orejeras gold, for the treasury of his Majesty and for\r\njudicial expenses. The money was to be paid within thirty days\r\nunder pain of death. He and the fiscal of the king appealed to the\r\nroyal Audiencia--which, on an examination and new trial, revoked the\r\nsentence, and condemned him to death and to the loss of all his goods\r\nin favor of the royal exchequer and the treasury of his Majesty. The\r\nsentence was executed.\r\n\r\nMagat Salamat was condemned to death. His goods were to be employed\r\nfor the erection of the new fortress of this city. He appealed to\r\nthe royal Audiencia; but the case was remitted to the governor, in\r\norder that justice might be done--except that the goods were to be\r\nset aside for the treasury. The sentence was executed.\r\n\r\nDon Agustin Manuguit was sentenced to exile in Nueva España for six\r\nyears, and condemned to pay twenty taes of orejeras gold toward the\r\nbuilding of the new fortress. Failing to pay this sum, the term of\r\nhis exile would be doubled. He agreed to pay it, and the sentence\r\nwas executed.\r\n\r\nDon Luis Balaya, chief of Bangos, was sentenced to exile from his\r\nvillage for two years, one prescribed and the other unconditioned. He\r\nwas also condemned to pay ten taes of orejeras gold toward the building\r\nof the fortress, to which he agreed.\r\n\r\nAlonso Lea was acquitted on the trial.\r\n\r\nAmarlangagui, chief of the village of Tondo, was exiled from this\r\njurisdiction for four years, two prescribed and two unconditioned. He\r\nwas also condemned to pay fifteen taes of orejeras gold toward the\r\nsaid building of the fortress. He agreed to this, and the sentence\r\nwas executed.\r\n\r\nDon Joan Banal, chief of Tondo, was sentenced to exile from this\r\njurisdiction for six years, and condemned to pay ten taes of orejeras\r\ngold toward the building of the said fortress. He agreed to this,\r\nand paid the money.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Amaghicon, Indian chief of the island of Cuyo, sentence\r\nis yet to be passed by the governor; for the man was brought hither\r\nonly a short time ago, as he lived very far from this city.\r\n\r\nThe said sentences, as specified, were executed upon the above-named\r\npersons. Those who were exiled to Nueva España are about to sail in\r\nthe ships which are to be despatched this year to that country. As for\r\nthe goods [confiscated], most of the men have paid their fines; but in\r\ncase of those who have failed to do this, the alcaldes-mayor have been\r\nordered to make investigations about them. They are already doing so,\r\nas appears from the said trial and process, to which I refer. And,\r\nin order that the whole matter may be evident, I give by the said\r\ncommand the present record, in Manila, on the thirteenth day of July\r\nin the year one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine. I affix my seal,\r\nin testimony of the truth.\r\n\r\n_Esteban de Marquina_, notary-public.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, the notaries who have here signed our names, [16] certify and\r\nattest that Esteban de Marquina, from whom proceeds this authenticated\r\nrecord, is indeed a notary-public, of the number authorized in this\r\ncity, as is stated herein, and is now exercising his office; and\r\nthat the deeds, attestations, and records which have been and are\r\ntransacted in his presence have been and are thoroughly certified\r\nand authenticated, both within court and without. Done at Manila,\r\non the thirteenth day of July in the year one thousand five hundred\r\nand eighty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Gaspar de Ayala to Felipe II\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nLast year I gave your Majesty a detailed account of the events that\r\nhad hitherto occurred in these islands; of what has since happened I\r\nwill give account in this letter. As soon as the ships left for Nueva\r\nEspaña, we set about building a ship of seven hundred toneladas at\r\nthe cost of your Majesty's royal exchequer. As purveyor thereof was\r\nappointed Captain Don Juan Ronquillo, alcalde-mayor of the province\r\nof Pintados. The ship is being built in that district, and paid\r\nfor out of the tributes which your Majesty has from that province;\r\nand this city provided some articles which were lacking there. The\r\npurveyor writes that he can make the voyage this coming year. This ship\r\nwill be the fourth of your Majesty's vessels on that route [to Nueva\r\nEspaña]. I understand that two of them will be of no use for this next\r\nyear, as they will have to be laid aside. Thus it will be necessary,\r\nthat the navigation on that route may not cease, that ships be built\r\ncontinually. Although the Mariscal Grabiel de Rribera and Captain Juan\r\nPablo de Carrion are each building a ship, they will not be able to\r\nsupport them, and will be obliged to sell them at the port of Acapulco\r\non the first voyage, for the Piru trade. Although they could be bought\r\nin these islands on the account of your Majesty's royal exchequer,\r\nit seems to me better that your Majesty should save the profits that\r\nwill be made after their construction; since they can easily be built\r\nat much less cost than if they were bought after they are built.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of your royal exchequer have been audited this year, and\r\nare being sent with everything clearly expressed. The entire accounts\r\nare set forth and the data in detail, each class by itself. Because\r\nthe gold was very cheap this year, on account of the great lack of\r\ncoin, some uneasiness was felt for your royal exchequer. Its income\r\nhas not reached the value of last year, although your Majesty's gold\r\nhas been more valuable than that of private persons, because it had\r\nto be distributed in various payments. If it were possible for your\r\nMajesty's royal treasury to keep the gold and sell it at the coming of\r\nthe ships, there would be considerable profit. However, as the gold is\r\nbeing constantly needed, and there is nothing else with which to meet\r\nthe salaries and other necessary obligations, it is, when there is a\r\nlack of coin, distributed at the common value--although, as I have said\r\nbefore, a somewhat higher value is given to your Majesty's gold. If,\r\nas I have written in other letters, your Majesty would be pleased to\r\ncommand forty or fifty thousand pesos to be brought every year from\r\nNueva España to the royal treasury of these islands, returning thence\r\nthe value thereof in gold, it would give the greatest relief to this\r\ntreasury and profit to your royal exchequer; for twenty-five thousand\r\npesos in gold, at the price at which it is given in tribute by the\r\nIndians, would amount to fifty thousand in Nueva España. This could\r\nbe done very easily, if your Majesty would assume the risk of the\r\ntransportation of the money and the return of the gold. As a result,\r\nyour royal treasury could in a short time be free from obligations,\r\nand could aid in the maintenance of this kingdom. [_Marginal note_:\r\n\"Abstract this clause, and send it to the viceroy of Nueva España.\"]\r\n\r\nBy virtue of your royal decree received by your governor in the past\r\nyear, concerning the sale of the magistracies and offices of notary,\r\nby order of your said governor the following offices were sold, in the\r\nusual manner of selling your royal property: Four public notaryships\r\nin this city, at eight hundred pesos each; the notarial office of\r\nPanpanga, at one thousand pesos; that of the province of Pintados,\r\nat one thousand seven hundred pesos; that of Cebu, at six hundred;\r\nthat of Bombon, at three hundred; that of Ylocos, at three hundred;\r\nthat of Camarines is set at six hundred, and has not been adjudged\r\nto a bidder. These offices were sold with some inducements, in order\r\nthat there should be more bidding. Of ten magistracies which were\r\nplaced at auction, five were sold--the first at one thousand four\r\nhundred pesos, the second at nine hundred, the third at a thousand,\r\nthe fourth at one thousand two hundred, and the fifth at nine hundred\r\nand ten. The others are left to be auctioned upon the arrival of the\r\nship from Nueva España. To increase the value of the offices sold,\r\nthere were also admitted some bonuses, after payment of which, I\r\nunderstand, the offices will clear fifteen thousand pesos more or\r\nless. That the magistracies might have more value to meet the present\r\nnecessities, your said governor commanded that they be sold with the\r\ncondition that the owners thereof could renounce them by depositing\r\nin your royal treasury the third of the value, as is done with the\r\noffices of clerks. Should your Majesty confirm this, it will be of\r\nmuch profit to your royal exchequer.\r\n\r\nBesides the notarial offices which your royal decree ordered to be\r\nsold, no mention was made of those of La Laguna, of the Coast and\r\nTondo, of Bulacan, of the cabildo of this city, and that of Pangasinan,\r\nwhich are all large jurisdictions and have notaries appointed by\r\nthemselves. Moreover, there may thus be sold the office of notary of\r\nthe alcaiceria [silk-market] of the Chinese, where there is a separate\r\njudge; and that of the mines and registries, with the inspection\r\nof the Chinese ships, in the form provided by your governor, and\r\nused by Thomas Perez. If this last office were sold with the others,\r\nwe could find a person who would give therefor five thousand pesos;\r\nand should your governor provide the office of al-ferez-mayor and\r\nthat of depositary-general, it would come to six thousand pesos. I\r\nunderstand that if your Majesty should command these offices to be\r\nsold by open vote in the cabildo, there would be found many purchasers.\r\n\r\nWhen Alonso Veltran, your notary of the court of this Audiencia,\r\ndeparted for Nueva España, he sold his office, by official permission,\r\nto Alonso de Torres, an honored merchant, for four thousand five\r\nhundred pesos. The third thereof was placed in your royal treasury\r\nof which he made royal exhibition in the Audiencia, and asked to be\r\nadmitted to the possession and exercise of said office. When your\r\ngovernor examined the records, he said that the cognizance of that\r\ncause was not for the Audiencia, but for the governor, because the\r\ngeneral decree providing for the sale of offices for Nueva España came\r\naddressed to the viceroy. Consequently, the Audiencia referred to the\r\ngovernor the cognizance and decision of this matter; and he declared\r\nthat the said Alonso de Torres was not entitled to admission. Although\r\nthe latter appealed, he did not dare continue the case, in order,\r\nas he said, to avoid misfortune. For this reason, your royal treasury\r\nlost one thousand five hundred pesos. To remedy this, and to increase\r\nyour royal exchequer, it is most important for your Majesty to command\r\nthat the said general decree directed to the viceroy of Nueva España\r\nin the year eighty-one, [17] which treats of the sale and renunciation\r\nof offices, be observed in these islands. Its fulfilment should be\r\nenforced by your president and auditors; and, when a vacancy occurs\r\nin any office, the said office should be sold, in order that your\r\nroyal treasury may have some relief. If it is not thus commanded,\r\nthe governors will exercise the privilege of providing offices.\r\n\r\nLast year I reported to your Majesty that, because of the death of\r\nDoña Ana de Palacios, there had been left vacant an encomienda owned\r\nby her in Camarines. Petition had been made to your governor that\r\nit be placed to the account of your royal crown, in virtue of your\r\nMajesty's royal decree; and that twelve thousand pesos of income should\r\nbe paid to this royal Audiencia. But because Captain Joan Maldonado\r\npresented another decree in which your Majesty commands that there\r\nbe given him two thousand pesos of income from unallotted Indians,\r\non account of his many services and extreme poverty, part of the\r\nsaid encomienda was given him; while to your royal crown there was\r\nassigned the other part, amounting to eleven hundred Indians, more or\r\nless. Moreover, at the end of December of the past year, eighty-eight,\r\nthe encomienda owned by Don Luis de Sagajosa at Ylocos was left vacant\r\nby his death. I petitioned your governor to place it to the account\r\nof your royal crown, in compliance with the said royal decree. He\r\ndeclared that it could not be allotted to the crown, but that it would\r\nremain vacant, and the income would be assigned to your royal treasury\r\nas royal property, until your Majesty should command otherwise. Less\r\nthan seven hundred Indians of this encomienda were apportioned to your\r\nroyal crown, in order that the income therefrom should be enjoyed by\r\nthe hospital. Appeal from this was made to the Audiencia, and the case\r\nwas continued. The result thereof was that another decree was issued\r\nby your Majesty to the Augustinian friars, in which your Majesty\r\ngranted them a gift and alms of ten thousand ducats, payable within\r\nten years in unassigned Indians. In consideration of their poverty,\r\nI consented that from the income of this encomienda there should be\r\ngiven them three hundred pesos every year, until your decree should\r\nbe fulfilled. Then a revision of the decree was issued, ordering that\r\nthe said encomienda be allotted to your royal crown; but that from the\r\nincome thereof there should be given to the hospital six hundred pesos\r\nfor eight years, and to the convent of San Agustin three hundred pesos\r\nevery year until your decree should be fulfilled. After the payment\r\nof that nine hundred pesos, the grants for religious instruction, and\r\nthe costs of the collection, I understand that there will remain clear\r\nfor your royal treasury the sum of one thousand four hundred pesos,\r\nbesides the nine hundred of the hospital and convent after their dues\r\nare satisfied. The Audiencia placed this encomienda to the account of\r\nyour royal crown; for, although your governor was ordered twice to do\r\nso, according to the ordinances of first consideration and revision,\r\nhe would not comply. He was ordered to give a writ, in order that\r\nthe officials of your royal exchequer could hold it as title.\r\n\r\nLater, on account of the death of Captain Villanueva, two encomiendas\r\nwere left vacant--one called Malgandon, and the other near this\r\ncity--which were worth two thousand pesos of income. As soon as he\r\ndied, without notice thereof having been given to me, on the first\r\nday of last May before daybreak, your governor assigned the said\r\nencomiendas--that of Malgandon to Cristoval de Axqueta; and the\r\nother to Don Luis Enrriques, who abandoned another encomienda which\r\nhe held, of as much and more income, but somewhat farther away from\r\nthis city. At the same time the encomienda that he had abandoned was\r\nassigned, half to each of two other soldiers. On the following day\r\nI heard the news, and I presented myself in the Audiencia in order\r\nto appeal, and to take exception to whatever possession should\r\nbe taken. I appealed from whatever writ of possession might be\r\nprovided; and I ordered that a copy of this appeal be handed to the\r\nparties. Cristoval de Axqueta kept himself hidden, in order that notice\r\nmight not be served on him; and four or five days after my appeal\r\nthe possession which I had opposed was given him by an alcalde-mayor\r\nof Pangasinan. The other litigants did not take possession; and, the\r\ncase being concluded, a writ was issued, by which all were protected\r\nin their possession. The decision in respect to the ownership was\r\nsubmitted to your royal Council of the Indias, I having appealed\r\nfrom the writ. The case has been concluded and considered, and the\r\ndecision has not been reached; of that I shall later send a report\r\nto your Majesty.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons your governor is inciting the soldiers and telling\r\nthem that I am depriving them of means of sustenance, and various\r\nother things, in order to set them against me, and make himself\r\npopular with them, while disparaging me. Consequently, some of them\r\nbear me ill-will. Your said governor, although he knows that he cannot\r\ntake Indians from your royal crown, has assigned some of them three\r\nor four times; and I have had them taken away by process of law. He\r\nsatisfied himself by telling the soldiers that he had given them a\r\nmeans of support, but that I had taken it away. As I took exception\r\nto his acts, and caused several encomiendas to be revoked which\r\nhad been given by him, he says that he is not the governor, but I\r\nam. I beseech your Majesty to be pleased to command your governor to\r\nrefrain from such indignities to me, as the diligence which I exercise\r\nand the actions at law which I cause are for your royal service, the\r\nincrease of the royal exchequer, and the fulfilment of my conscience\r\nand obligation. As I am hated in this country for doing my duty,\r\nwould your Majesty be pleased to favor me by granting me leave to\r\ndepart, and giving me a charge elsewhere where I may serve better and\r\nmore satisfactorily, and where no one will complain of me. When your\r\nMajesty receives this, I shall have served in this office of fiscal\r\nalmost seven years. Should your Majesty not be disposed to grant me\r\nthis favor I shall continue in my service here until I die.\r\n\r\nStill later, at the death of Doña Maria de Miranda, two encomiendas\r\nwere left vacant, both worth a thousand pesos of income. They were\r\ngiven to Don Fernando de Villafaña, by virtue of your royal decree,\r\nin which it is commanded that your governor should give him an\r\nencomienda of Indians. He has served in these islands about ten years,\r\nand for his good service and poverty but little has been given him. On\r\nthis account, and as your Majesty had commanded that he be given an\r\nencomienda of Indians, I took no exception, as in the other cases.\r\n\r\nThis year there came from China eleven or twelve vessels with but\r\nlittle merchandise, because, as they say, there have been many wars\r\nand a severe plague. It has been reported that a ship from Panama\r\nor Piru, prepared to lay out a large sum of money, has arrived at\r\nMacan, which is on the river of Canton. As I have stated in previous\r\ncommunications, if it is permitted to carry on trade between Piru\r\nor Nueva España and China, this country will be depopulated and\r\nruined. The principal means of support here is the merchandise from\r\nChina, and the profit which results from sending those goods to be\r\nsold in Nueva España. This would be completely done away with, should\r\nships go from that country or Piru to China; for it is evident that,\r\nif these ships bought the merchandise needed, there would be no market\r\nor sale for the goods brought from these islands. Neither would the\r\nChinese come here with their ships to sell the goods, or at least\r\nnot in so large numbers; and besides the general loss to this land,\r\nthere would be lost the customs duties of import and export.\r\n\r\nAt my petition, in view of the fact that a large part of the gold\r\npaid as tribute had not been declared, and the fifth taken, it was\r\ndecreed that within a fortnight after the collection of tribute, the\r\ngold should be declared, and the registers of collection displayed,\r\nbefore the officials of your royal exchequer, under penalty of\r\nlosing the third part of the tribute for that year. The aforesaid was\r\nproclaimed and notification was given to the encomenderos of this city,\r\nand the decrees therefor were sent to the alcaldes-mayor. Nevertheless,\r\nthere is laxity in the declarations; and it would be of great benefit\r\nfor your Majesty to order the officers of your royal exchequer to\r\nexercise great care in this, and to see that the disobedient suffer\r\nthe penalties. [_Marginal note_: \"Bring the decrees in this case.\"]\r\n\r\nLast year a fragata was despatched from this city to Maluco. Therein\r\nwere two descalced friars, who were going to that court on business\r\nconnected with their order; and they carried with them a packet of\r\nletters from this Audiencia and your governor. This fragata anchored\r\nin a port of the island of Borney, called El Paso; and the natives\r\nattacked them, after having given assurance of safety so that they\r\nwould land. They killed one of the friars, and all the men except\r\nthree or four Spaniards; and burned the fragata, after having robbed\r\nit. Those who escaped say that this attack had been made by order\r\nof the king of Burney, and that a Spanish soldier who had gone\r\nthere had been persuaded to turn renegade. They pay him a stipend\r\nfor making plans for stone fortifications, and making weapons and\r\npowder. Your governor despatched a ship, sending a messenger to ask\r\nfor this soldier; but the reply has not yet come. Many people were\r\nof the opinion that, if soldiers had been in these islands in any\r\ngreat number, a fleet should be sent to attack the said king--both\r\nfor the reason already given, and because he was a tributario to\r\nyour Majesty, and has refused to pay tribute. But with the few\r\ntroops in these islands, no expedition can be made, nor do we who\r\nare in Manila feel at all secure, with the forces that we have in\r\nthis kingdom. There are many enemies and but few Spaniards, and\r\nthe latter are dying in great numbers every day. Also, for lack of\r\ntroops, punishment has not been meted out for the insolence which, as\r\nI reported to your Majesty last year, had been perpetrated by the king\r\nof Mindanao. In the past few days the Indians of Cibu have revolted,\r\nand have killed the encomenderos who were collecting the tribute,\r\nand other soldiers. They seized the women, and detained them for a\r\nlong time, until the alcalde-mayor of that island, with a number of\r\nfriendly Indians and fifty or sixty Spaniards, attacked and chastised\r\nthem. Some were killed in the encounter, and those most guilty were\r\nhanged. Thereupon the said alcalde-mayor wrote that that island was\r\npacified. It lies more than one hundred and fifty leagues from this\r\ncity. Later, on the seventh of last June, there came further advices\r\nfrom the said alcalde-mayor, to the effect that the natives of said\r\nislands, with other neighboring peoples, had conspired to burn the\r\ncity, and kill all the Spaniards who might be there; and that several\r\nof the principal authors of the plot have been captured, and steps are\r\nbeing taken to arrest the others. Your governor sent him instructions\r\nas to what he should do.\r\n\r\nFour or five months ago two soldiers came from the city of Segovia,\r\nlocated in the province of Cagayan. They were sent by the alcalde-mayor\r\nof that province, bringing word that the province was all in rebellion\r\nand that the Indians had killed many Spaniards. The natives were so\r\nbold and daring that they entered into the city to murder and rob. He\r\nbegged for reënforcements of troops and ammunition, or that province\r\nwould be depopulated. It is the most important of these islands as\r\nit is the nearest to Japon and is within fifty leagues of the coast\r\nof China. Reënforcements were sent by the master-of-camp, Pedro de\r\nChaves, with four or five ships and fifty soldiers, besides what\r\nsupplies and ammunition they could take. We have received news of\r\ntheir arrival only. The outcome of the expedition I will relate when\r\nit is over. Captain Martin de Barrios was also slain by the Indians\r\nwhile he was collecting the tribute from his encomienda, together with\r\nother soldiers; and I am ready to certify that there are few places\r\nin these islands where the natives are not disaffected. When there is\r\nany uprising they communicate with one another, make allies, and send\r\nmessengers to keep up relations. This is because the Indians know that\r\nthere is but a small force of Spaniards, and that they are separated\r\nfrom one another, and that their punishments are not inflicted as\r\nthey formerly were, under a military régime, but by a judicial order.\r\n\r\nThe past year we were informed that the Indian chiefs of this\r\ndistrict had met together at different times to discuss rebellion\r\nagainst your royal service, and the death of all the Spaniards in\r\nthese islands, and the mastery of this land which was enjoyed by\r\ntheir forefathers. At the time when this happened there was in this\r\ncity a Japanese captain, who had come here ostensibly for trading and\r\ncarrying on commerce. The natives made arrangements with him to come\r\nto their aid with ships and soldiers. They were to give him part of\r\nthe land, and would send messengers to the king of Borney and other\r\nprincipal Indians of other provinces, in order that they might come to\r\ntheir assistance. They swore very solemnly according to their custom\r\nto keep and fulfil the agreement. They chose a king, captains, and\r\nofficers of war; and weapons were made in secret. On the discovery\r\nof their treachery and plots, the principal chiefs were arrested;\r\nseven or eight of them were hanged and beheaded, and their property\r\nconfiscated. Many others were exiled, some from their villages, and\r\nothers to Nueva España who sail in this ship. By this punishment it\r\nseems as if the people have become somewhat cowed. May God aid us,\r\nand free us from so many dangers to which we are exposed. This land\r\nwill be lost and ruined if your Majesty does not expressly order a\r\ngoodly number of soldiers to be sent here, and that something be paid\r\nto the men for their support. It is pitiful to see them die of hunger,\r\nand if they are not paid no soldiers will care to come here, to be\r\nin captivity; and we are dying off very fast. Your Majesty should\r\nnot permit such a thing; for, although this land is of much cost and\r\nno profit, it is a foothold and stepping-stone by which to enter the\r\nrealms of Great China. For this it is very important to learn that\r\nlanguage, and for some religious of the orders of St. Augustine and\r\nSt. Dominic to teach the Chinese in that tongue, since in that wise\r\nthey will become fond of our religion. May God bring this to pass,\r\nlater. It would tend greatly to the preservation of the soldiers,\r\nshould your Majesty order your viceroy of Nueva España to send a doctor\r\nto these islands, although he should be given a salary from your royal\r\ntreasury of Nueva España. For lack of a physician and of someone who\r\nknows how to cure sickness, many of the people die--especially the\r\nsoldiers and sailors, who have few comforts.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's galleys in this city are useless, and serve for nothing\r\nwhatever. It will be more profitable and less costly to have a couple\r\nof small ships and another couple of armed fragatas. This can be done\r\nif your Majesty will order them to be built, and the galleys to be\r\nbroken up.\r\n\r\nThe fort, which is being built of stone, has been fractured in some\r\nplaces, from the great weight. They say that it is caused by the\r\nsmall amount of cement used, and because it is near the water and\r\nbuilt in a round shape. It seemed as if it could be made secure by\r\nbuilding three buttresses with three cavaliers; and this work is\r\nnow being done. If the cavaliers had been built at first, much money\r\ncould have been saved; but, as there are no engineers here, they have\r\ndone the best they could--although several captains say that they had\r\ngiven warning at the beginning of the work. For this there has been\r\ncollected a little more than four thousand pesos from certain duties\r\nwhich used to be paid to your Majesty on the money brought from Nueva\r\nEspaña. Later, collections were made from the Indians of the land,\r\non each being levied one real--thus raising another twelve thousand\r\npesos, more or less. Now another tax of one real has been levied on\r\nthe Indians, who are oppressed by it; but as your royal treasury is\r\nso poor, everything must be borne.\r\n\r\nIn last year's letter I advised you that at my petition, taxes were\r\nlevied on the Indians in their suits, according to the tariff of Spain,\r\ncharging the Spaniards triple the amount. Finding that the clerks\r\ncould not support themselves on so small fees, and at risk of levying\r\ntoo much, it was ordered that the fees be doubled, and it was so done.\r\n\r\nCaptain Esteban Rodriguez de Figueroa, son-in-law of the licentiate\r\nMelchior Davalos, your auditor, killed his wife and nephew, the own\r\nson of his brother, saying that they had committed adultery. This he\r\nproved by some Indian women of his house, although he did not find\r\nthem in the act. I conducted the trial, and, after review thereof,\r\ncondemned him to six years of exile, and a fine of five thousand\r\npesos for your royal court, the expenses of justice, and other things.\r\n\r\nThis year a Japanese ship came to this port with many supplies and\r\narms. There must have been more than five hundred arquebuses and as\r\nmany of their kind of swords, and some battle-axes. As the conspiracy\r\nof the Indians had taken place when the said ship arrived, it was\r\nbelieved that it came for the execution of that plot. On entering the\r\nport, this ship was boarded, and all its cargo was sequestered and\r\nthe crew imprisoned. It was learned that they were going to sell the\r\nweapons in Cian, and they were released from custody, on condition\r\nthat they would sell the goods here. This they did, and this country\r\nhas consequently been supplied with weapons.\r\n\r\nAs your royal treasury is usually in need and lack of money,\r\nit happened at the beginning of February of this year that,\r\non petition of the prebendaries and curas of the cathedral, the\r\nbishop of these islands commanded the royal officials, under pain\r\nof excommunication, to pay them the stipends assigned them from your\r\nroyal treasury--amounting to one thousand five hundred pesos annually,\r\nfor four prebendaries. According to my information your said officials\r\nowed them nothing whatever, in accordance with the agreement made with\r\nthem in the month of July of the year eighty-seven--namely, that from\r\nthat day they were to be paid their entire current salary; and of that\r\ndue them they were to be paid little by little, as your royal treasury\r\nwas so over-burdened. At this notification they replied to the bishop\r\nthat he could not be judge of that case, as it was a secular one\r\nand they were laymen. Of necessity, they appealed to the Audiencia;\r\nand the bishop ordered that they be declared excommunicated. This\r\nwas publicly done, and their names written on the public list, on a\r\nSaturday evening. After the Audiencia saw what difficulties would\r\nfollow on the excommunication of your royal officials, and after\r\nit had examined the proceedings in the report made to the judge, it\r\npassed an ordinance, asking and requiring the bishop to absolve and\r\nreinstate the officials until the documents could be examined in the\r\ncouncil-room. To this he gave a certain reply, and after considering\r\nthis, with the documents, another decree was made, in which it was\r\ndeclared to the bishop that he was not the judge of the cause, which\r\nthe Audiencia ordered to be retained under its own jurisdiction. As I\r\nwas not present at this decision it was ordered that I be notified,\r\nand that I should appear in the suit in defense of your royal\r\njurisdiction. Therefore, on the Monday next following, I presented\r\nbefore the said bishop a petition requesting that he absolve the\r\npersons excommunicated, and declare himself not to have jurisdiction\r\nover that cause. To establish the fact that the recognition thereof\r\ndid not belong to him, I stated in the first argument of my petition\r\nthat it could not pertain to him as the royal officials were mere\r\nlaymen, and not subject to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, but to\r\nthe royal. I alleged further reasons that the cause was secular and\r\ntemporal. Among other things, the bishop replied to the petition\r\nthat he was not satisfied with a proposition that I had offered,\r\nin reference to the holy office of the Inquisition. This caused\r\nexceeding disturbance and scandal in this city, because the bishop was\r\nnot content with saying what he did in reply to my petition; but to\r\nevery person who entered his house he said that I had been guilty of a\r\nheresy, and unlettered persons who heard this gave it credit. Moreover,\r\nas there is here a commissary of the Inquisition, he called together\r\nmany friars and certified this proposition, separating it from the\r\npetition and paying no attention to my purpose therein, or to the\r\ncircumstances under which I made it. I am sending a report of all the\r\nproceedings, in order that your Majesty may provide for the future,\r\nas to whether the bishop is to be the judge, and have entrance and\r\nprivilege to cause the salaries to be paid from your royal treasury,\r\nwhich your Majesty in kindness and mercy had ordered to be assigned to\r\nthe prebendaries and curates. The bishop, for the sake of peace, after\r\nhe had kept your royal officials excommunicated many days, refusing to\r\nobey or fulfil the ordinances of your royal Audiencia, issued a decree\r\nin which he gave up the decision of the cause to his Holiness and to\r\nyour Majesty. He protested that he would proceed with the case when he\r\nsaw fit. Although I stated in petition that the bishop had not complied\r\nwith the ordinances of the Audiencia, and that thereby he had incurred\r\nthe penalties provided--which I begged to have executed--everything was\r\npassed over, and it was not deemed proper to exact the penalties. In\r\nthis wise, whenever any dispute over jurisdiction occurs, the bishop\r\ndisplays like obstinacy, as he has done in other cases which are being\r\nadded to the principal one. If a penalty should once be imposed that\r\nwould hurt him, he would obey and comply with the ordinances of the\r\nAudiencia. But he says publicly that nothing can be done which will\r\nrestrain him, and this is what he desires. Because of this case the\r\nprebendaries and bishop abandoned the cathedral church and did not\r\nenter it, or celebrate the divine offices therein from the fourth of\r\nFebruary until the twenty-second of March--when, as it was holy week,\r\nthey returned. During this time only the cura came to the church, to\r\nsay mass; and thereby great complaint, scandal, and discontent were\r\ncaused among all the people. I beseech your Majesty to be pleased to\r\norder this case to be summarily settled. The bishop declares that he\r\nwill use the right, which he claims to own, when he sees fit to do so;\r\nand it should be decided if it is right to suffer this thing. Also,\r\nbecause I as fiscal attend to the defense of your royal jurisdiction,\r\nshould the bishop have license to declare in writing that I had made\r\na proposition touching the Holy Inquisition? It was not only this,\r\nbut that the statement went from one pulpit to another, by his\r\ncommand, that to say that the bishop was not judge of that cause\r\nwas a heresy. These and other words of which the Audiencia will\r\ngive information caused no little scandal in this city. Likewise he\r\nrefuses to obey the ordinances of the Audiencia, making light of and\r\ndisputing over them, for which he may be restrained and condemned in\r\ntemporal matters.\r\n\r\nIt is quite common for controversies to arise between your governor and\r\nthe bishop as to which of them is to assign the salary to be given to\r\nthe ecclesiastics who administer instruction, both in the encomiendas\r\nof your royal crown and in those of private individuals. Since the\r\nsalaries in the encomiendas of the crown are paid from your royal\r\nexchequer, it is but just that your governor assign them, or at\r\nleast that they do so jointly. In this way your royal patronage\r\nwill be better guarded, and it will be known for whom the bishop is\r\nproviding. I beg your Majesty to be pleased to have suitable orders\r\ngiven in this matter, and that it be done shortly, for every day more\r\nand more difficulties arise.\r\n\r\nA case has been considered in the Audiencia, between the bishop and\r\nthe order of St. Augustine, as to whether the said order and the\r\nreligious thereof are to administer instruction to the Chinese living\r\nin the village of Tondo. Ever since the settlement of this town,\r\nthey have had a convent there, ministering to the natives in their\r\nown language. They say that they have also instructed the Chinese,\r\nwho understand what they say. The bishop placed in this town friars\r\nof his own order, the Dominican, so that they could minister to the\r\nChinese in a chapel there. The Augustinians complained, saying that\r\nby a brief of his Holiness, and a royal decree which they presented,\r\ntwo monasteries of different orders should not be situated in the same\r\ntown, or in its vicinity. The Audiencia passed an ordinance requiring\r\nthat within thirty days the bishop should appoint ministers of one\r\norder, to administer instruction to the natives and the Chinese. As\r\nthis ordinance concerned a matter already adjudicated, the bishop\r\nasked for a declaration of their position; and it was thereupon\r\ndeclared that by that ordinance the Dominicans were not excluded\r\nfrom the administration of instruction to the Chinese. An appeal was\r\nthen made on the part of the order of St. Augustine; and they said\r\nthat some of their religious would in a short time know the Chinese\r\nlanguage. They were commanded by ordinance to observe the past decree,\r\nuntil your Majesty should have been consulted and should provide\r\notherwise. Afterward, when the Augustinians saw that they were not\r\nby the said ordinances excluded from administering instruction to\r\nthe Chinese, they commenced to undertake this work. The bishop, as he\r\ndesired a religious of the said order who was said to know the Chinese\r\nlanguage to preach to the Chinese on the afternoon of St John's day,\r\nwent to the town of Tondo, which is opposite this city, on the other\r\nside of the river. He had trouble with the Augustinian friars, and\r\nthe abovementioned religious would not consent to preach. Thereby was\r\ncaused much severe comment and scandal, both among the natives and\r\nChinese, and among the Spaniards. The Augustinian friars complain that\r\nthe bishop, being a Dominican, favors his own order and persecutes\r\nthem; and that before the coming of the Dominicans to these islands\r\nthey did not have this persecution, but peace and concord.\r\n\r\nThere is great need of religious to administer instruction to the\r\nnatives, since of the few who were here a large number have died,\r\nthis year and last. There are many places without instruction, and\r\nin still others there are ecclesiastics who do not know the language,\r\nfrom which it results that the natives cannot be well instructed. It is\r\nof much importance for the welfare and pacification of this land that\r\nreligious should come here, because in those places where they are now\r\nstationed the Indians live more peaceably and with less license. I\r\nbeseech your Majesty to be pleased to give orders for their prompt\r\ndespatch, since their coming is so necessary for the service of God\r\nand the good of souls. They should be of the three orders already here.\r\n\r\nIn this city there are two hospitals, one for Spaniards and the\r\nother for the natives. That of the natives is under the charge of a\r\nFranciscan friar, [18] who cares for them and ministers to them with\r\nmuch charity. It seems as if God supports them as by a miracle; for\r\nthere are usually more than a hundred patients, sick with all kinds\r\nof diseases, and they are maintained by alms, as they have no other\r\nincome. It would be very injurious if the Franciscan friars should\r\nabandon it; and thus it will be expedient for your Majesty to order\r\nthat they hold and administer it, as has been done hitherto. Moreover,\r\nlicense should be given for said hospital to send four toneladas\r\nof pepper as cargo on the ships which sail every year from these\r\nislands to Nueva España. There should be levied on them neither\r\nduties in these islands, nor freight charges at Acapulco; for with\r\nthis privilege, which would little affect your Majesty's interests,\r\nthey can further the work, and support themselves.\r\n\r\nThose who are serving your Majesty in this royal Audiencia are:\r\nthe doctor Santiago de Vera, your president; the licentiate Melchior\r\nDavalos, the licentiate Pedro de Rrojas, and the licentiate Don Antonio\r\nde Rribera, your auditors. The first two suffer from many ailments\r\nand infirmities. There are also myself, a secretary, a reporter,\r\nthree attorneys, and interpreters and other officials of the Audiencia.\r\n\r\nThe persons who have been provided with offices this year are the\r\nfollowing: Don Fernando de Villafaña, alcalde-mayor of La Laguna, with\r\na salary of three hundred pesos, the amount usually given to other\r\nalcaldes-mayor; Pedro Manrique, alcalde-mayor at Pangansinan, who has\r\nserved your Majesty nine years, in these islands; Cristoval de Leon,\r\nchief magistrate at Calompite, an elderly man, long in the land, and\r\nwith wife and children; Gaspar de Ysla, chief magistrate at Lubao,\r\none of the early colonists, and married; Captain Gomez de Machuca,\r\nalcalde-mayor of Camarines, who has served ten years in this country,\r\nand married here; Bartolome Pacheco, alcalde-mayor of Bulacan, who has\r\nseen six years' service in this land; Captain Don Alonso Maldonado,\r\nalcalde-mayor of the alcaicería of the Chinese, who has served here six\r\nyears; Clemente Hurtado de Monrreal, alcalde-mayor of the coast of this\r\ncity, who has seen six years' service here; Lorenço Lopez de Abiste,\r\nalcalde-mayor of the island of Çubu, who has served here six years;\r\nCaptain Don Diego de Alcaraso, who was appointed by your governor\r\nas warden of the old fort, at the death of Captain Juan Maldonado,\r\nwho used to hold it, and draws a salary of three hundred pesos; Juan\r\nde Bustamante, who was appointed by your governor as inspector to the\r\nIndians, and is now inspecting in the province of Ylocos; Don Gaspar\r\nde Vera, son of your governor, who was appointed as general of the\r\nsea; and Joan, Cantero, alcalde-mayor of Calompite, who has served\r\nseventeen years in this land.\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-ninth of June returned the messenger sent by your\r\ngovernor to the kingdom of Burney to ask the king to deliver to him\r\nthe soldier who had turned renegade, as I have said above. Although\r\nthe king made some excuses for his acts, he nevertheless refused to\r\ndeliver the renegade.\r\n\r\nOn the same day there was an unusually severe tempest of wind and\r\nwater in this city. The natives say that they never saw such a\r\none. The sea and the river Madre rose until they joined and reached\r\nthe fort. Much damage was done in the houses; and worse still, two\r\nships which were here loading a cargo for Nueva España--one belonging\r\nto your Majesty, and the other to the mariscal Grabiel de Rivera--were\r\ndriven on the coast by the force of this tempest, and it is understood\r\nthat they cannot be repaired. Even should one of them be repaired,\r\nit cannot make the voyage this year. In all the port not one ship\r\nor fragata escaped, except one small boat, which was taken to send\r\nadvices to Nueva España of the condition of this land, which is\r\nmost unpropitious. By this calamity, so injurious to the community,\r\nthe people have become greatly disheartened. Moreover, as I write\r\nthis clause, we have had thus far no news of ships from Nueva España,\r\nalthough this is the seventh of July. The entire support of this land\r\ndepends on the coming and going of the ships; and if they are not\r\nhere by May or the middle of June, by delaying longer they run great\r\nrisk of being lost, and with them the welfare and support of this\r\nland. Sailing from the port of Acapulco at the beginning of March,\r\nthey would arrive here in good time and without risk from storms. As\r\nthis is of so much importance, I beseech your Majesty to be pleased to\r\norder your viceroy of Nueva España to exercise the utmost diligence\r\nin the early despatch of the ships which are to come to this land,\r\nin order that they may accomplish the purpose of the voyage.\r\n\r\nOn the first of July, arrived the master-of-camp, Pedro de Chaves,\r\nwho had gone to chastise the Indians of the province of Cagayan,\r\nwho as I have said before, were at war. Although he had gone out\r\nwith sixty soldiers and more than eight hundred friendly Indians, he\r\ndid nothing whatever except to cut down their palm-trees and destroy\r\ntheir crops. He says that the Indians themselves burned their villages\r\nand went to the mountains. It is known, however, that he left that\r\nprovince in a worse state of war than before, and when the Indians\r\nsee our men turn back and leave them they regain courage.\r\n\r\nWe Spaniards are very few in number, and are surrounded by enemies\r\non every side. If we are not relieved in time by the despatch of\r\nreënforcements, it will be impossible to apply a remedy when it\r\nis wanted. As I have already said, we are but few, and the troops\r\ndie very quickly. When the Indians see an opportunity to crush us,\r\nthey are not likely to let it slip. I beseech your Majesty to be\r\npleased to order your viceroy that, when your governor sends to ask\r\ntroops and ammunition, or other necessaries, he should send them;\r\nand also that he should send some money, because on account of the\r\nmany extraordinary occasions for expense which every day arise, your\r\nroyal treasury is usually much embarrassed and in debt. Sometimes,\r\nfor lack of money, important things are left undone.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the ninth of this month, I was in the cathedral, where\r\nwere gathered all the people and the orders, as there was to be a\r\nsolemn procession and sermon. The deacon came out to sprinkle the\r\nholy water, and went directly to the choir and sprinkled it on the\r\nbishop and all the persons who were in the choir. It is the custom\r\nto give it first to the Audiencia. When the deacon came back from\r\nthe choir, your president and auditors told him that if the bishop\r\nwould not cause precedence to be observed for the Audiencia, they\r\nwould go to hear service elsewhere. When the bishop learned this,\r\nhe left the church immediately, and sent orders to the preacher not\r\nto preach; and we were left without a sermon, to the great scandal\r\nof the people gathered there.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing else at present. Only I pray that our Lord may\r\npreserve your Majesty many years in perfect health, and with increase\r\nof greater kingdoms and seigniories, in His holy service. At Manila,\r\nJuly 15, 1589.\r\n\r\nThe licentiate _Ayala_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyal Decree Regarding Commerce\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King: To Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, [19] knight of the order of\r\nSantiago, and appointed by me governor and captain-general of the\r\nPhelipinas Islands. As soon as Father Alonso Sanchez, a religious\r\nof the Society of Jesus, came here, ordered and empowered by all\r\nthe estates of the islands to discuss certain matters regarding\r\nthe service of our Lord, and the welfare and preservation of the\r\ninhabitants and natives of those islands, I ordered certain members of\r\nmy councils to come together to hear him. This they did, and a thorough\r\nexamination was made of certain memorials which that religious had\r\nbeen ordered to present. [20] After they had consulted with me upon\r\ncertain points of the said memorials, I decided, with the approval\r\nof the above-mentioned councilors to whom the matter was delegated,\r\nupon the following instructions which are given to you. I order you\r\nto fulfil your duties, in every respect, with the consideration,\r\ncare, and diligence which I expect from you. The father has also\r\nentreated me, in behalf of the said city, to order that no persons\r\nentering the ports of the said islands from without shall be made to\r\npay duties--whether they be Chinese, Portuguese, Japanese, Siamese,\r\nBorneans, or any other people whatsoever, especially when they bring\r\nprovisions, ammunition, and raw material for these articles. These\r\ntaxes are a grievance to the Chinese, and trade is hindered, and there\r\nare other resultant disadvantages, as the said Father Alonso Sanchez\r\nhas informed me at length; accordingly I have held and do now hold it\r\nbest that for the present no more of the said duties be levied upon\r\nprovisions and ammunitions. Therefore you will not permit any duty\r\nto be levied until otherwise ordered and decreed. Another advisable\r\nmeasure discussed was that no Chinese or foreign ships could sell at\r\nretail the goods which they carried to the islands, as is done now;\r\nnor could the inhabitants buy the goods, openly or in secret, under\r\nsevere penalties. The purchase of the said goods was to be discussed\r\nby the Council, and as many and so qualified persons as the business\r\ndemanded were to be appointed. These persons alone should buy in a\r\nlot all the merchandise brought by the ships, and then distribute it\r\nfairly among the citizens, Spanish, the Chinese, and the Indians,\r\nat the same price at which it should be appraised. The matter was\r\ndiscussed and examined by the members of the said Council, and it\r\nhas seemed best to send you the decision reached in this affair,\r\nas I now do. I order you, keeping this in mind, to give the orders\r\nwhich you may think acceptable to me. You will keep me informed of\r\nyour proceedings, and will not permit or allow any person to go to\r\nthe ships except the ones appointed to do so by a special order. You\r\nwill endeavor to give products of the islands in exchange for the\r\nsaid merchandise, so as to avoid, if possible, the introduction of so\r\nmuch coin into foreign kingdoms as has been customary. Besides the\r\ngood results which will follow from carrying out the provisions of\r\nthe preceding clause, we may expect another of no less importance;\r\nand that is, that by enforcing the regulations, not only will you\r\nrid yourself of the Chinese retailers, who conceal and sell their\r\nmerchandise, but there will be also avoided many other losses,\r\nexpenses, and scarcity, and the secret sins and witchcraft which\r\nthey teach. Their shops, which are necessary for the sale at retail,\r\ncould, in the course of the year, be given up to Spaniards, so that\r\nthey might remain in their possession and bring them profit. Such a\r\ncourse would also bring together a larger number of citizens. You might\r\npermit the Chinese Christians and other old inhabitants to remain,\r\nwho do not come and go, and are not retailers in the true sense of\r\nthe word; but who work as mechanics, carpenters, gardeners, farmers,\r\nand in other labors for food production. Considering the importance\r\nof this affair, you are warned not to permit or allow the presence of\r\ninfidels and retailers in the said islands; and to prevent their coming\r\ntogether in so large numbers as to give rise to difficulties. All this\r\nyou will carry out with the care and diligence which I am confident\r\nlies in your character and prudence, and the zeal which you will show\r\nwhere my service is concerned. San Lorenzo, August 9, 1589.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions to Gomez Perez Dasmarinas\r\n\r\n\r\nThe King: To Gomez Perez Dasmarinas, knight of the order of Santiago,\r\nwhom I have appointed as my governor and captain-general of the\r\nPhilipinas Islands. Upon the arrival of Father Alonso Sanchez, a\r\nreligious of the Society of Jesus, who came, by order and authorization\r\nof all estates of the said islands, to confer about certain matters\r\npertaining to the service of our Lord and the welfare and preservation\r\nof the inhabitants and natives of the islands, [21] I convened certain\r\nmembers of my councils in order that they might hear him. After they\r\nhad done so, and had examined in great detail certain memorials\r\nthat the father presented, in accordance with his orders, and had\r\nconsulted with me in regard to all the points of the said memorials,\r\nI resolved, with the advice of the aforesaid my counselors, to whom\r\nI committed the matter, upon what will follow here, which will serve\r\nas your instructions. I order you to observe and fulfil them to the\r\nletter, with the consideration, care, and diligence that I expect\r\nfrom your person.\r\n\r\n2. Infinite thanks should be given our Lord, and I hereby offer\r\nthem to Him, for the great mercy that He has been pleased to show\r\nme, in that, during the period while I, by His mercy and will,\r\nrule as king, and through me as the instrument, those so remote\r\nislands have been discovered; and that at present, as I have heard,\r\nmore than two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants enjoy in those\r\nislands evangelical instruction, besides the great inclination which is\r\nmanifest to spread the knowledge of our holy Catholic faith throughout\r\nthe other islands with which all that great archipelago is sown and\r\ninhabited for the space of more than nine hundred leguas of latitude,\r\nand more than five hundred of longitude. This does not include the\r\nvast kingdoms of the mainland--China, Cochina, Conchinchina, Champa,\r\nCanvoja, Siam, Patan, Joor [Johore], and others--notwithstanding\r\nthat I wish and desire that a pathway to them be opened. In order\r\nthat this end be attained, it is necessary that for the present, and\r\nuntil our Lord so dispose and direct it, the conservation of what\r\nhas been pacified and conquered, by so great labor and at so vast\r\nexpense to my exchequer, be looked after carefully. I charge you\r\nstraitly to see to this, taking note of the condition of affairs,\r\nwhat is advisable for their continuous improvement and settlement,\r\nand giving them a sound foundation, so that among so many enemies,\r\nnot only may they be preserved, but continue to increase daily.\r\n\r\n3. First: The above-mentioned father, Alonso Sanchez, has reported\r\nthat the cathedral of those islands, located in the said city of\r\nManila, has no building, ornaments, or other adornments pertaining\r\nto the service of divine worship; or income, or alms for its aid, or\r\nin order to provide it with sacristans, verger, or other necessary\r\nassistants; and that being, as is the case, in the gaze of so many\r\nidolatrous enemies and Mahometans, both natives and foreigners who meet\r\nthere--especially the Chinese, who have observed this condition--it\r\nis very annoying that they should see it served so inadequately\r\nand covered with wood and thatch--poor, dilapidated, and without\r\nprovision. And because it is very just, and in accord with my will\r\nand desire, that the above-mentioned church be built and served with\r\nall possible propriety, you shall, as soon as you arrive at the said\r\nislands, especially further the building and construction of the\r\nsaid church. You shall apportion for this purpose the sum of twelve\r\nthousand ducados, in three parts--to wit, one from my royal exchequer,\r\nanother from the encomenderos, and the third from the Indians, as is\r\ndone in Nueva España. The said twelve thousand ducados shall be spent\r\nupon the said building within four years, spending three thousand\r\neach year. And in order that it may be better done and be commenced\r\nimmediately, I have ordered two thousand ducados paid, in anticipation,\r\non the account of my third, from my royal treasury of the said Nueva\r\nEspaña. As you pass there, you will ask them to send this amount.\r\n\r\n4. I have been told that there are two hospitals in the said city of\r\nManila--one for Spaniards, and the other for Indians--and that both\r\nof them suffer extreme need; for to that of the Spaniards resort many\r\nsoldiers, sailors, and other poor folk, who become ill through certain\r\nexertions in my service, and those common to that country; while that\r\nof the Indians is sustained by themselves, by means of their fruits,\r\nwork, and tributes. All those who are treated in the latter hospital\r\nfall sick in the same manner as the others, and in the foundation\r\nand preservation of the settlements. Both classes die in discomfort,\r\nthrough having no building in which to be protected from the ravages\r\nof the climate, and through the lack of beds, food, medicines, nurses,\r\nand other necessities. It would be advisable to send these supplies\r\nfrom the said Nueva Spaña, together with some blankets. This is,\r\nas you see, a work of the greatest charity, and it is especially\r\ndesirable to assist with great care in the consolation and treatment\r\nof the sick. And besides that, you shall have diligence to examine\r\nthe hospital built there, and ascertain what care is taken of the\r\nsick. From the first repartimientos that may become vacant in the\r\nsaid island, you shall apply to the principal hospital sufficient\r\nfor an income of five thousand pesos annually; and to that of the\r\nIndians, five hundred ducados annually, granted from the increase of\r\nthe tributes of the Indians (which shall be collected in the manner\r\nset down in the sixth section of these instructions), so that both\r\nmay enjoy the said income as long as may be my pleasure. From these\r\namounts the necessary buildings shall be constructed, and other things\r\nprovided, so that both may be properly conducted. In order that this\r\nmay be commenced immediately, I have granted four hundred ducados\r\nto the principal hospital, and two hundred to that of the Indians,\r\nto be paid from my royal treasury of the said Nueva Spaña, as you\r\nwill see by the decree that will be given you.\r\n\r\n5. The said Father Alonso Sanchez also reported that the need of\r\nministers of instruction in the said islands is so great that many\r\nIndians die without baptism; that because of the same need, the\r\nconquest and conversion of other islands are neglected; and that\r\nit would be advisable to send religious from the orders established\r\nthere, with instructions to remain there and not go elsewhere. Already\r\npermission has been granted and the needful care taken, so that\r\nsome religious may go there, and others will be provided as soon as\r\npossible. All of them shall be notified to resolve upon staying in the\r\nsaid Philipinas Islands, and not to go to any other place without the\r\nexpress permission of the bishop and of yourself. Therefore I charge\r\nyou that, whenever any religious shall offer themselves to you to\r\nleave the said islands, you shall confer with the said bishop, and\r\nshall consider and discuss the matter; but you shall grant the said\r\npermission only after thorough consideration.\r\n\r\n6. Another section of the above-mentioned memorials indicates how\r\ninstruction may be provided, not only where there is none, but also\r\nwhere there is some, although inadequate; that it would be advisable to\r\nincrease the tributes and clear up the appraisements of the tributes,\r\nfor they are at present in a very confused and dangerous condition,\r\nbecause of many scruples and injuries connected with them; and that,\r\nas each Indian's tribute has hitherto generally been collected in\r\npesos of eight reals apiece, it should reasonably be raised to the\r\nvalue of ten Castilian reals to each of the said pesos--provided that\r\nthe Indian may not be forced to pay it in any designated article,\r\nbut only in money, if he have it, or shall choose to give it, or in\r\nsome other article produced by him, or in goods acquired in trade,\r\naccording to their valuation at the time of payment. Because, after\r\ndiscussing this point, it is believed that each peso may be increased\r\nby two reals to make up the ten, as is petitioned, therefore you shall\r\norder that this increase be paid into my royal treasury, and that half\r\na real be used to pay the obligations of the tithes, and the other one\r\nand one-half reals be used for the pay of the soldiers stationed in\r\nthe said islands, and for other things pertaining thereto; and that\r\nthe encomenderos be obliged to pay, from the eight reals remaining,\r\nfor the necessary instruction, and their share of the building of\r\nthe church, during the time of its construction, in accordance with\r\nthe foregoing. The said Indians shall reserve the choice to pay the\r\ntributes in money or in products, in whichever one they wish.\r\n\r\n7. Another section of the said memorials also petitions that in\r\norder that this increase of tributes may be more justifiable, the\r\nencomenderos be ordered to pay the tithes, according to the use and\r\ncustom in Mexico; for, inasmuch as the commonwealth previously had\r\nneither church, bishop, curates, nor settled rule, the tithes have\r\nnot been paid. This is a just order, and as such you shall enforce it,\r\nproviding that the said tithes due be paid from the products of their\r\nfarms and their animals.\r\n\r\n8. On the part of the said city of Manila, I have been petitioned to\r\nhave it granted some public property, in order that it may attend to\r\nthe affairs of peace, war, government, and other matters pertaining to\r\nits conservation and defense, and for suits that may arise--granting it\r\nfor this purpose some Indians, or something from the duties on Chinese\r\nmerchandise, or on the storehouses or shops where they trade. After\r\nadvising with my counselors, I have determined to bestow upon the\r\nsaid city for six years, for its public property, one-half of the\r\nfines and pecuniary penalties paid into my treasury, and the incomes\r\nfrom the said storehouses; with the obligation that, each three years,\r\nthe account of money thus obtained be sent, as well as a statement of\r\nwhat is expended. You shall take care to procure the advancement of the\r\nsaid city in this, to watch in what manner this grant is used, and to\r\norder that the said account and statement be sent at the proper time.\r\n\r\n9. I have also been petitioned, in the name of the said city, to\r\norder that neither in the said city nor in any other part of the\r\nother islands shall be paid the three per cent duty [22] imposed by\r\nDon Gonzalo Ronquillo, as the country is very new and needy, and the\r\ninhabitants have to assist in many other things. Although I would be\r\nvery glad to relieve them, still expenses are so heavy, that I must\r\naid myself by whatever is available. Therefore it will be advisable to\r\ncollect the said three per cent. You shall give orders to this effect;\r\nand that the amount that is collected from these duties on merchandise\r\nbe placed in my treasury on a separate account, and it shall be used\r\nfor paying the soldiers stationed there; and that of the rest that\r\nis collected this duty be discontinued for the present. [23]\r\n\r\n10. I have also been petitioned, in the name of the said city, to order\r\nthat none of those who resort from foreign parts to the ports of the\r\nsaid islands--as Chinese, Portuguese, Japanese, Cianese, Burneyes, or\r\nany others--pay duty, especially on food, ammunition, and materials\r\nfor ammunition. Because of this, much annoyance is caused--as, for\r\ninstance to the Chinese--and the steady course of trade is hindered,\r\nand other troubles follow. After receiving detailed information from\r\nthe said Father Alonso Sanchez, I have considered and still consider\r\nit advisable that, for the present, the collection of the said duties\r\non provisions and ammunition be repealed; and therefore you shall\r\nnot allow them to be levied until I order and provide otherwise.\r\n\r\n11. I was also petitioned by the said islands to order that, inasmuch\r\nas none of the merchandise from Sevilla to Mexico pays any duties\r\non the first sale, it be not paid on the merchandise sent from\r\nthose islands to the port of Acapulco, or other places. So little is\r\ncollected in said port of Acapulco, namely, twelve pesos per tonelada\r\nof freight on the goods of the inhabitants--the duty imposed by Don\r\nGonçalo Ronquillo--and because likewise the proceeds of this duty are\r\nneeded to pay the said soldiers, you shall order that it be collected\r\nfor the present for the above purpose.\r\n\r\n12. One of the things most conducive to the good government of the\r\nstate and the happiness of the members and parts composing it, is\r\nthe equitable administration of distributive justice. Accordingly, I\r\ncommand that the offices at your disposal and the advantageous posts\r\nof the country be given to men who merit them by their services and\r\ncapacity, in such manner that the offices be filled by old citizens,\r\nwho have lived in the country at least three years, and are citizens\r\nof it; and the encomiendas to soldiers who shall have lived there in\r\nactual military duty and service. Among them you should always give the\r\npreference to those who are most deserving; including, with the other\r\ncircumstances of greater and better services in the country, their\r\nlength of residence there. They must not be sons, brothers, relatives,\r\nservants, or friends of yours; for--besides that you are advised that\r\nyou are not to grant encomiendas of Indians or provide offices to\r\nsuch men; and, with this end in view, a sufficient salary is given\r\nyou to enable you to help them--it is not right for men who are but\r\nnew arrivals, and have done no work, to enjoy the fruit of another's\r\ntoil. If rewards are bestowed justly, all will serve willingly in the\r\nhope of attaining reward. Therefore it is my will that you observe\r\nthis order; and, that it may be thus inviolable, I declare that, now\r\nand henceforth, your said sons, brothers, servants, and friends shall\r\nbe incapable of holding the said encomiendas or offices. And because\r\ncertain persons, who already hold encomiendas in the said islands,\r\nand with these easily [can satisfy] whatever needs they may have,\r\nare begging for further reward, you are advised not to grant them\r\nany more until many others--who, as I have been informed have been\r\nthere for so long a time and are deserving, and have toiled in the\r\nconquest and maintenance of the country, to a much greater extent\r\nthan those who are petitioning anew; but who have not been rewarded,\r\nand therefore are poor, irritated, and querulous--shall be provided\r\nand rewarded with encomiendas and other posts and means of gain. You\r\nshall take especial care to reward those whose names follow:\r\n\r\n13. Diego Ronquillo, former governor and captain-general of those\r\nislands, who, I am told, exercised the said offices excellently and\r\nto the complete satisfaction of the country.\r\n\r\nDon Rodrigo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, son of the governor Don Gonçalo\r\nRonquillo.\r\n\r\nCaptain Antonio Rodriguez Chacon.\r\n\r\nCaptain Agustin de Arceo.\r\n\r\nCaptain Don Gonçalo Vallesteras Saavedra.\r\n\r\nCaptain Diego del Castillo.\r\n\r\nCaptain Don Juan Ronquillo del Castillo.\r\n\r\nCaptain Caravallo.\r\n\r\nCaptain Rodrigo Alvarez.\r\n\r\nCaptain Gomez de Machuca.\r\n\r\nHernando Muñoz de Poyatos, regidor of Manila.\r\n\r\nEnsign Juan de Medrano.\r\n\r\nMiguel Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nEnsign Antonio Guerrero.\r\n\r\nCharavia, an old and good soldier.\r\n\r\nGaspar Ruiz de Morales.\r\n\r\nAguilar, likewise an excellent soldier.\r\n\r\nVillalobos.\r\n\r\nBartholome Rodriguez.\r\n\r\nSargeant Cantero.\r\n\r\nGaspar de Ysla.\r\n\r\nEnsign Christoval de Azcueta.\r\n\r\nGeronimo de Cuellar.\r\n\r\nLuis Nuñez Hernandez.\r\n\r\n[14]. Others, who are said not to have been there so long, but who\r\nare men of worth and account, are as follows:\r\n\r\nDon Francisco de Porras y Guevara.\r\n\r\nJoan de Alcega.\r\n\r\nDon Luis de Velasco.\r\n\r\nDon Fernando de Villafañe.\r\n\r\nChristoval Gueral.\r\n\r\nJoan Verdugo, who has lost his right arm in my service.\r\n\r\nJoan Diaz Guerrero.\r\n\r\nBlas Garcia.\r\n\r\nJoan de Cuellar.\r\n\r\nGaspar de Mena.\r\n\r\nDiego de Çarate, who is returning with you, and who, I have been\r\ntold, has usually been a commander, and has put down a rebellion,\r\nand has served faithfully.\r\n\r\n15. You shall provide for and reward all of the above according to age,\r\nmerits, and individual qualifications; and shall give them preference\r\nover all others who do not possess the above qualifications, in the\r\ndistribution of encomiendas, posts of government and war, and other\r\nmeans for the advancement of the country.\r\n\r\n16. I charge and order you to observe the same plan in all that\r\npertains to the commissions and sources of profit, on land or on\r\nsea--especially in the choice of masters and officers of vessels. For\r\nbesides observing, in regard to them, that they must have rendered\r\nservice and deserve the appointment, the others will be encouraged,\r\nit will attract hither those who have gone away, and the country will\r\nbe settled and increased.\r\n\r\n17. I have been petitioned also, in behalf of the said city, that\r\nall those who have worked, or have held appointments for wages or\r\npay, in the said islands be paid their wages there--as for instance,\r\nsailors, carpenters, smiths, and all others who live there, and they\r\nmust live there permanently; and that the money for this purpose be\r\npaid from the said royal treasury of Mexico--in order that the country\r\nmay become more thickly settled, and other good results follow. In\r\nregard to this, since there will be a treasury there, from which it\r\nmay be paid, you shall be careful to order that those who labor be\r\nreimbursed fully for their services; and, if there is insufficient\r\nmoney to meet the obligations, you and my royal officials shall advise\r\nmy officials of the said Nueva España thereof, where an order will be\r\ngiven to furnish that portion which appears, by sufficient testimony\r\nand report, to be needful.\r\n\r\n18. In place of the third office of my royal treasury--namely, the\r\noffice of factor, which I ordered to be suppressed--they petition for\r\na ship-purveyor, in order that the vessels may leave better equipped\r\nand more promptly; for the other two officials are so busy that they\r\ncannot attend to it. As it would be advisable to place this in charge\r\nof the factor whom I am having appointed, you shall have care to see\r\nthat he attends to it, as far as may be necessary, so that there may\r\nbe no grievance or lack in this matter.\r\n\r\n19. In regard to the trade of the said islands, on which their growth\r\nlikewise depends, the said Father Alonso Sanchez relates that the\r\nlarge consignments of money sent there by wealthy people of Mexico,\r\nwho do not quit their homes, is one of the things which has ruined\r\nthe country; for great injuries result from it. The first is that\r\nall Chinese goods are bought by wholesale and are becoming dearer,\r\nso that the poor and common people of the said islands cannot buy\r\nthem, or must buy them at extremely high rates. The second is that,\r\nas the said consignments are many and large, and the vessels few in\r\nnumber--being at times, and in fact generally, not more than one; and,\r\nby this one being quite laden and filled with goods for Mexicans,\r\nthere is no space left for the citizens and common people to embark\r\ntheir goods. They have petitioned me that, as a remedy for the above\r\nwrongs, I forbid the sending of consignments of money from Mexico,\r\nor the maintenance of agents or companies in the said islands for any\r\nperson of Nueva España; that only the inhabitants of the islands be\r\nallowed to buy and export domestic and foreign goods to the said Nueva\r\nEspaña; and that, if anyone else wishes to trade and traffic, it must\r\nbe on consideration of his becoming a citizen and residing there for\r\nat least ten years, and of not trading with the property of another,\r\nunder penalty of its confiscation, besides that of his other personal\r\neffects. Since, by this method, some goods would still be sent to\r\nMexico, the money now taken by the Chinese would not be withdrawn from\r\nthe country, and goods would be bought more cheaply and in exchange for\r\nproducts of the islands. Now, because I am desirous of the advancement\r\nof the said islands, and the best interests of their inhabitants,\r\nI have therefore granted them by one of my decrees [24] that, for\r\nthe space of six years, only the said inhabitants may trade in China\r\nand in the said Nueva España. You shall observe the said decree, and\r\nshall not allow anything to be done in any wise contrary to its tenor.\r\n\r\n20. The question was also discussed whether it would not be better\r\nto prohibit Chinese or other foreign vessels from selling at retail\r\nthe merchandise that they bring to the said islands (as is done\r\nnow), and the inhabitants of the country from buying those goods,\r\nin public or private, under heavy penalties; and to provide that,\r\nfor the purchase of the said merchandise in bulk, as many and as\r\ncapable persons as the matter requires be there deputed and appointed,\r\nso that they, and they alone, may buy in mass all the goods brought\r\nin the vessels, and afterward divide them among the Spanish, Chinese,\r\nand Indian inhabitants, with just and fair distribution, at the same\r\nprices which they paid for them. After discussion and conference by\r\nthe members of the said assembly, it was decided to refer the entire\r\nmatter to you, as I hereby do. I order you, since you will have the\r\nmatter in hand, to ordain therein what you deem best. You shall advise\r\nme of what you do, and shall not permit or allow any person to go\r\nto the vessels except those assigned for that purpose, in the order\r\nthat shall be prescribed. You shall see that their said merchandise\r\nis exchanged for other products of the islands, so that the taking\r\nof so much coin as is now carried to foreign kingdoms may be avoided.\r\n\r\n21. In addition to the good effects, that, it is said, will result\r\nfrom the execution of what is ordered in the above section, it is\r\npresupposed that another, no less important, will follow--namely,\r\nthat, through the operations of the aforesaid, the Chinese hucksters\r\nwho lurk there and hawk their goods, will not stay there. Moreover,\r\nother very heavy expenses and increase in prices, and the secret\r\nsins and sorceries which they teach, would be avoided; while their\r\nshops, which are necessary for retail trade, in the course of the\r\nyear could be given to Spaniards, so that the profits could remain\r\namong the Spaniards, and there would be an opportunity for more\r\npersons to acquire citizenship. The Chinese Christians and other old\r\ncitizens who are not transients, or who are not expressly hucksters,\r\nbut workmen--such as mechanics, carpenters, gardeners, farmers,\r\nor those engaged in other food trades--might be permitted to remain\r\nthere. Inasmuch as this is a matter of importance, you are advised not\r\nto permit or allow any infidel hucksters in the said islands; or so\r\nmany to become residents there that they may give rise to any trouble.\r\n\r\n22. Should you consider it advisable to permit and allow the\r\ninhabitants of the said islands to go to Japon, Macan, or other\r\nkingdoms, or settlements, whether of Portuguese or heathen, in order\r\nthat those countries may admit our commerce, you may do so--first\r\ntaking especial care that no trouble arises therefrom, and that it\r\nis attended with no danger.\r\n\r\n23. You shall cause the fifty settlers and fifty farmers whom you are\r\nto take with you to assemble, and go with you, according to the order\r\ncontained in my decree that treats of this. In order to incline them to\r\nmake the voyage, you shall give them the rewards and privileges which I\r\nhave granted to them, which you shall maintain to the utmost. You shall\r\ntake especial care that they attend to their settlement and farming;\r\nand that for the space of fifteen years, they and the Indians who aid\r\nand accompany them in their farming are not to be compelled to go to\r\nwar, or to engage in any other personal service, such as manning the\r\nvessels, building, or any other services which may hinder or fatigue\r\nthem. And since it is fair that, if these rewards and accommodations\r\nare given them, they, on their part, engage only in the work for which\r\nthey go; and since peaceful men who are not forced from their trade\r\nand mode of living, apply themselves better, you shall see to it that\r\nthose who enlist and are taken be married farmers, of humble estate\r\nand quiet disposition. From each one of them you shall take accredited\r\nbonds, to the amount that seems advisable to you, that for the period\r\nof six years they will not change to any other occupation or means of\r\ngain, or do anything else beyond the thing for which they enlisted,\r\nunder the penalties which you may impose, and which you shall inflict.\r\n\r\n24. You shall see that the chiefs and timagua Indians have just\r\ncontracts and shares with the farmers, so that they may conceive\r\na liking for and learn farming as practiced here; and so that the\r\nSpaniards may have those who can supply them with people and other\r\nnecessities. You shall see that these Indians are intelligent and know\r\nhow to keep their contracts with the farmers, especially if they are\r\npeaceful, as above stated.\r\n\r\n25. The said islands, as I am told, need stallions, mares, cows,\r\nand other domestic animals. In order that they may be bred there\r\nin numbers, I am writing to the viceroy of Nueva España to send\r\nto the said islands twelve mares, two stallions, twenty-four cows,\r\nand two bulls. You shall ask him for these as you pass there, and\r\nshall take them with you in your vessels as you go upon your voyage;\r\nand whatever you think needful for the animals can be brought from\r\nChina and Japon. You shall order those farmers who are about to go\r\nto the said islands, and the chiefs, to tame and breed buffaloes,\r\nso that with all these animals there may be a sufficiency to carry\r\non the farming, and for other needful services.\r\n\r\n26.  It was also petitioned in behalf of the said islands that,\r\nnow and henceforth, the encomiendas be given under the obligation\r\nand condition that the encomendero shall work a patch of ground,\r\nand assist the farmers and Indians, so that they also may work and\r\ncultivate the soil. You shall strive to begin this, and shall give\r\nlands and homesteads, farms and horses, for breeding and farming,\r\nto the settlers and farmers, without any prejudice to the Indians.\r\n\r\n27.  Upon your arrival at the said islands, you shall find out how\r\nand where, and with what endowment, a convent of secluded girls may\r\nbe established, so that both those who go from here, and those born\r\nthere may stay in it, and live respectably and well instructed, and\r\ngo out therefrom to be married and bear children. By this method\r\nand by the naturalization of persons in the land, its population\r\nwill increase continually. You shall endeavor to find some good plan\r\nor method for doing this without encroaching on my royal treasury,\r\nor so that it may be relieved as much as possible. You shall advise\r\nme of it on the first opportunity, as well as of the method that can\r\nbe employed in endowing the said poor girls; and how and from what\r\nsource other smaller dowries may be established, in order that the\r\nIndian women may marry poor Spanish soldiers and sailors.\r\n\r\n28.  In regard to what is petitioned by the said islands about\r\nappointing citizens of the islands to the posts therein, and not\r\nselling the offices, as former governors have tried to do, you shall\r\nlook to it carefully, and favor and reward the citizens.\r\n\r\n29. Further, it was proposed also that, as far as the natural fitness\r\nof the land and the settlements of the Indians permitted, it would be\r\nadvisable to order that encomiendas of not less than eight hundred\r\nor one thousand Indians be granted, for there are tithes for the\r\ninstruction, and the other expenses of maintenance, which small\r\nencomiendas cannot bear; and that those who have but few Indians\r\nbe allowed to transfer or sell them at their pleasure to other and\r\nneighboring encomenderos, so that, by this union, the encomiendas may\r\nbe larger, and may be able to meet the above expenses. Inasmuch as\r\nall matters pertaining to the sale of encomiendas have been enacted\r\nwith great care, and it is not fitting to violate these enactments,\r\nyou shall not permit this request. But you shall see to it carefully\r\nthat the repartimientos have enough for instruction, and for the\r\nmaintenance of the encomenderos. You shall endeavor to establish the\r\nIndians in settlements, which shall have adequate instruction. This\r\nyou shall attend to with the most rigorous care and attention.\r\n\r\n30. Among the things most wasteful of property, and which\r\nembarrass, and may cause harm in, a country so new, because of\r\nthe animosity and quarrels resulting therefrom, are the suits and\r\ncontroversies engendered among the citizens, and among the Indians\r\nthemselves. Although it is my will that complete justice be observed\r\nin each case, I charge you that, in so far as may be possible, and\r\ncan be rightly done, you settle the differences and suits which\r\narise, without having recourse to the technicalities of the law\r\nor proceeding by the ordinary methods, or condemning to pecuniary\r\nfines; but observing throughout the provisions of the decrees that\r\nshall be given you. And in order that all may enjoy the blessings\r\nwhich must ensue from so mild a government, and may live in ease and\r\ncontentment, and without any perturbation in the great undertakings\r\nthat, God helping, will be accomplished, I am writing in like tenor\r\nto the bishop of the said islands in regard to what touches their\r\necclesiastical service. You shall give him my letter, which shall be\r\ndelivered to you, and you shall charge him straitly in my name.\r\n\r\n31. I have been informed that there has been and is poor system, and\r\nworse observance and fulfilment of the ordinances, in the collection of\r\nthe tributes of the disaffected or never-pacified encomiendas; and that\r\nit would be advisable to command that the ordinances be kept, and that,\r\nsince such encomiendas ought not to be abandoned, at least the entire\r\ntributes should not be collected, but only a small portion of them, as\r\na token of recognition. For since the Indians of the said encomiendas\r\nreceive no spiritual or temporal benefit from their encomenderos, it\r\nis not right that they pay the tributes--especially as soldiers are\r\nsent annually to make the collection. This latter renders impossible\r\nthe pacification of the country; and hence a large portion of the said\r\nislands are in revolt, and we must subdue Burney, Maluco, Mindanao,\r\nand other neighboring islands and mainlands. This matter demands much\r\nreform as you may plan. Therefore I charge you to ordain for this\r\npurpose what you may deem best, after consulting with the bishop;\r\nand that you carry your resolution into prompt and rigorous execution,\r\nin order that so great and injurious annoyances may cease.\r\n\r\n32. As I have been informed, there is but little instruction in the\r\nsaid islands, and much difficulty in providing it, which is greatly\r\nincreased by the natural conditions of the country, since it all\r\nconsists of islands. Most of them, too, are so small that they do\r\nnot have a population of more than three to five hundred Indians,\r\nand some even of less than one or two hundred. It is also prevented\r\nby the long and dangerous navigation, the heat, the rains, and the\r\npoor roads of the country. It is not right that even all of these,\r\nor the many other greater hindrances and difficulties should turn\r\naside the accomplishment of what is so important. Therefore I order\r\nand charge you straitly that, immediately upon your arrival in the\r\nsaid islands, you shall note very particularly how this instruction\r\ncan be furnished. After ascertaining the opinion of the bishop, with\r\nwhom you shall meet and whom you shall charge, in my name, to aid in\r\nthis matter with his person, as I expect from him--since, in truth,\r\nthis matter is one for him to procure and bring about, by reason of\r\nhis office--you shall enact what you consider advisable, so that all\r\nparts of the islands may have sufficient instruction. This shall be\r\ndone with kind and gentle methods, in accordance with the will of the\r\nchiefs; and all the Indians who are dispersed shall be established\r\nin settlements, in order that account of them can be taken. You shall\r\nhave the greatest care possible in procuring the accomplishment of what\r\nis ordained and enacted, since without that all the work will be lost.\r\n\r\n33. Since I desire the welfare and conservation of the said Indians,\r\nand their protection and defense, and as I think that the said bishop\r\ncan procure this better than anyone else, I am writing to him, and\r\ncharging him with their protection. I am quite sure that he will be\r\nvery glad to undertake this, inasmuch as it pertains to the service of\r\nour Lord and the relief of his conscience. And in order that everything\r\nmay be done better and more smoothly, you shall maintain the best of\r\nrelations throughout with the said bishop; and on your part, you shall\r\nhave the greatest care to protect the said Indians and to aid them.\r\n\r\n34. I have been informed that, because the soldiers who are stationed\r\nin the said islands receive no pay, nor have any other remuneration,\r\nthey obey orders very unwillingly, and are discontented, since\r\nthey endure the greatest poverty and affliction; that they are all\r\nspiritless, sick, necessitous, and compelled to become servants. Many\r\ndie from their discontent, hunger, lack of comfort, and less provision\r\nfor their sicknesses; and others escape by claiming to be married,\r\nsick, or bound to religion. As a consequence, the country has fallen\r\ninto disrepute, and men of the requisite valor and quality do not\r\ngo there, but only a very few poor, unarmed, and worthless men. If\r\nany of these do have weapons, they pawn or sell them for clothes and\r\nfood. Their needs constrain them to commit injuries upon the natives,\r\nso that the latter are irritated. It is said that not only is there no\r\nincrease in what has been conquered, but that even that pacification\r\nis becoming more doubtful each day; that domestic and neighboring\r\nenemies are being aroused; and that all of this would be remedied by\r\ngiving pay to the said soldiers, who should be regularly and promptly\r\npaid. Inasmuch as it is my will that this be done, it was decided,\r\nafter having considered how many soldiers it is necessary and advisable\r\nto maintain usually in the said islands, that there be four hundred\r\nsoldiers; and that each one receive a monthly wage of six pesos,\r\nthe captains thirty-five, the ensigns twenty, the sergeants ten,\r\nand the corporals seven. Also that the sum of one thousand pesos\r\nadditional pay be distributed annually and proportionally among all\r\nof the companies, each person not to receive more than ten pesos each\r\nyear; and that this additional pay be given according to the order\r\nand manner set forth in the decree that will be handed you. You shall\r\norder that the said soldiers be regularly paid, and see that they are\r\nsatisfied, armed, and well disciplined; that the said number of four\r\nhundred soldiers be not lessened; and that they be divided into what\r\ncompanies you deem fitting. When you shall appoint the said captains,\r\nofficers, or soldiers to any encomienda or other post, you shall not\r\npermit them to draw their pay any longer; and while they receive pay\r\nthey cannot trade or traffic, for their solicitude in that pursuit\r\nnecessarily occupies their minds and distracts them from their proper\r\nobject and the practice of war. For the same reason, likewise, you\r\nshall not grant the said pay to any soldier who acts as servant to\r\nanother person, whoever he may be. Whenever any repartimientos of\r\nIndians become vacant in the said islands, you shall apportion some\r\nof the Indians to my crown, as an aid toward the said pay.\r\n\r\n35. In respect to the said captains, officers, and soldiers, you shall\r\nobserve, and cause to be observed, their privilege of exemption from\r\narrest for debt contracted while they were in the service; or the\r\nseizure of their weapons, horses, or other things needful and proper\r\nto military service, in satisfaction therefor.\r\n\r\n36. Whenever you shall send any captain with men on any commission\r\nor business that arises, you shall order him also to maintain his\r\nprivileges, in whatever pertains to the usual exercise of the power\r\nand authority requisite to command, direct, and punish his inferiors;\r\nas well as all the other things peculiar to the service, and which\r\nare conceded to and exercised by officers.\r\n\r\n37. It is my will that you have a body-guard of twelve halberdiers,\r\nwho shall be paid the same sum as the soldiers. The said halberdiers\r\nshall have a leader or captain, who shall receive pay of fifteen\r\npesos monthly. Although their principal service shall be to act as a\r\nbody-guard, and this is determined and ordained by that which pertains\r\nto the authority and dignity of your position, you shall take note\r\nthat they also must go to war upon any occasion that arises.\r\n\r\n38. Inasmuch as I have been informed that many of the soldiers,\r\nwho are sent to the said islands from Nueva España, are mere lads,\r\nmestizos, and a few Indians, and unarmed; and that a portion of them\r\nare pages and servants of the captains or other persons, who under the\r\ntitle and name of soldier draw their pay but neither they nor their\r\nmasters are soldiers: you shall allow none of them to be enrolled\r\nas soldiers unless they are more than fifteen years old; and accept\r\nno page or servant of any person, while he serves as such, as above\r\nstated. You shall receive only those mestizos who are worthy, but\r\nshall not open a gateway for this in general. I charge and recommend\r\nyou to pay especial attention to this.\r\n\r\n39. Immediately upon your arrival at the said islands, you shall\r\ngive orders to enclose the city of Manila with stone, along that\r\nportion where it is necessary and advisable, and on the other sides\r\nby water. You shall construct a fort in the place assigned and deemed\r\nbest there. You shall erect a tower at the junction and point made\r\nby the river and sea. All this shall be very thoroughly done, and\r\nwith most careful planning and consideration; and shall be done at\r\nthe least possible expense to my treasury--since, as you know, the\r\nbuildings can be constructed there with great ease and cheapness.\r\n\r\n40. You shall assign what garrison you judge advisable to the said\r\nfort and tower, so that the country may be defended, and that they\r\nmay check the designs and hopes of the enemy, and the fear of revolts\r\nand risings.\r\n\r\n41. Although you ought to live in great vigilance and the continual\r\ncaution demanded for the conservation of a country so new, distant,\r\nand surrounded by enemies, you must beware chiefly of five classes of\r\nthem. First, of the natives of the land, who are numerous, and but\r\npartially settled and established in the faith. Second, of four or\r\nfive thousand Chinese Indians who live there, and go back and forth in\r\ntheir tradings. Third, of the Japanese who usually go thither. Fourth,\r\nof the natives of Maluco and Borney, who are aroused, and already\r\ndisplay themselves boldly and openly. Fifth and chiefly, of the\r\nLutheran English pirates who infest those coasts. In order to check\r\ntheir incursions, and present a superior force and defense to them all,\r\nyou shall construct another fort in Yllocos or Cagayan, to oppose the\r\nJapanese and Chinese robbers; a second in Cebu, to oppose the Borneans\r\nand Malucos; a third in Panpanga, to oppose the Çambales. All shall be\r\nlocated in places where they may be effectual, and shall be carefully\r\nplanned and substantially built by good engineers. The cost will be\r\nvery little, because of the great abundance of materials, and because\r\nalmost all of the Indians are workmen. You are to see that each fort\r\nhas an adequate and desirable garrison.\r\n\r\n42. Besides these forts and presidios, it is presupposed that a\r\nmoderate-sized fleet of a few galleys or fragatas would be necessary,\r\nto cruise along the coasts in order to protect them, and to prevent\r\nthe thefts and injuries wont to be committed along them by the\r\nJapanese, especially in the districts of Cagayan and Ylocos. They\r\nseize the Chinese vessels that bring food and merchandise to the said\r\nislands, whereby great loss is suffered, and commerce and plenty\r\nchecked. This fleet would also serve to prevent the Chinese, when\r\nthey are returning to their own country, from going among the said\r\nislands and committing depredations on the natives of them, and as a\r\ncountercheck to other Chinese or Bornean pirates, as well as against\r\nall other undertakings, and troubles with foreigners. This appears\r\nadvisable to me, and desirable. Therefore, as soon as you shall arrive\r\nat the said island, you shall construct six or eight galleys. You\r\nshall note what Doctor Sande, my former governor of those islands,\r\nand Father Alonso Sanchez say--namely, that it will cost but from\r\none hundred and fifty ducados upward; and that there are, moreover,\r\nthe necessary accommodations. You shall order these vessels to be\r\nwell equipped, strengthened, and provisioned, so that they may be\r\neffectual. You shall give me an itemized account of the cost of the\r\nsaid galleys and facilities for building them.\r\n\r\n43. It is advisable to set about the construction of the said forts\r\nand galleys as quickly as possible, in order to avoid the troubles\r\nand harm that might ensue if the Spaniards, upon the occasion of any\r\ndanger from enemies, were compelled to retire inland among the Indians,\r\nwho are all irritated and offended because of the ill-treatment that\r\nthey have received; and I charge you straitly with this.\r\n\r\n44. Upon your arrival at those islands, and when the situation\r\nis actually before you, you shall investigate the new method and\r\ncircumstances with which the new entrances and pacifications are and\r\ncan be justifiably made, as well as the few soldiers, slight cost,\r\nand the great ease and profit with which they can be made, because\r\nof the country being divided into many islands, and there being many\r\npetty rulers. These fall out among themselves on slight occasion,\r\nand make treaties with the Spaniards, and hence are kept in order\r\nwith but little assistance. Since the petition made there in regard\r\nto the pay and the number of soldiers has been granted--and you are\r\nto maintain the soldiers in good discipline, and keep them quiet, and\r\npunctually paid--you shall make the said entrances and pacifications\r\nwith great circumspection and just cause, in which you shall observe\r\nthe rules of the instructions, which shall be furnished to you,\r\nregarding new discoveries.\r\n\r\n45. It is said that there is great need of such pacification in the\r\nsaid islands, especially in the very districts where the Spaniards\r\nlive and travel, for all of the natives are in revolt and unsubdued,\r\nbecause of the lack of soldiers, and of the injuries and annoyances\r\ninflicted upon the natives by what soldiers are there. Moreover,\r\nas we are informed from there, many provinces of the island of Luçon\r\neither have never been subdued, or, if subdued, have revolted--as,\r\nfor instance, those of Cagayan, Pangasinan, Payasondan, Çambales,\r\nBalente, and others, which are situated among the pacified provinces\r\nquite near and round about Manila; all the provinces, therefore,\r\nare in confusion and disorder. Upon your arrival at the said islands,\r\nyou shall ordain in this whatever is advisable. You shall proceed in\r\nthis as shall seem expedient, commencing as shall be right, and be\r\nattentive to the remedy for these evils, with very special care and\r\nassistance, since evil may happen to what is distant, if one's own\r\nhouse is left in suspicion and unsubdued. Besides there is the great\r\nobligation to endeavor to instruct the many people converted already,\r\nwho are under my royal protection. These, because of their lack of\r\nthe requisite peace and quiet, live in great hardship and danger;\r\nfor those who are in revolt and unpacified harass them daily, kill and\r\nassault them, and burn their crops. Because of this, and because they\r\nalso kill many Spaniards, not only is there no increase in what has\r\nbeen gained, but each day that is becoming less. Everything demands\r\nand requires so prompt a remedy, which is thus committed to you.\r\n\r\n46. Beyond and beside the said provinces which are here and there\r\ndisaffected among the Spaniards and the Indians already converted, are\r\nothers, which although not so near, owing to their remoteness and the\r\nnature of their inhabitants, still cannot be called new discoveries,\r\nbecause they have been visited and known already. These are Babuyanes,\r\nthe island of Hermosa, the island of Cavallos [\"horses\"], Lequios,\r\nthe island of Ayncio, Javas, Burney, Paca, Guancalanyanes, Mindanao,\r\nSiao [Siam], Maluco, and many others. Because it has been reported\r\nthat they are falling into a worse condition daily, and having been\r\nadvised that their welfare and the safety of the Spaniards demand\r\ntheir pacification, and that delay might render it difficult, you shall\r\nascertain the manner and method with which the said pacification and\r\nsubjection can be best and most quickly brought about, and you shall\r\nexecute it, as seems best to you.\r\n\r\n47. Since it seems advisable that you, from whom I expect so much,\r\nshould have authority and power to make all the said entrances and\r\npacifications at the cost of my royal estate, in respect to which if\r\nyou were constrained to await a reply from here, in a land so distant,\r\nimportant occasions and opportunities might be lost, I have resolved\r\nto give you authorization for this. Accordingly I grant it to you,\r\nand order the officials of my royal estate of the said islands that,\r\nin all matters under your control, they shall honor and pay all the\r\norders that you present to them for the said purpose. But you shall\r\nobserve that you are to use the said authority only in the most\r\nimportant matters which shall arise, after consulting about matters\r\nof law with the ecclesiastics and the lawyers, and those of action\r\nwith the captains and men of experience and conscience, and taking\r\naccount of all other necessary conditions, so that the expense may\r\nbe no greater than can be avoided, and profitable.\r\n\r\n48. In order that you may accomplish them better and avoid expense, I\r\nauthorize you to covenant and bargain with captains, encomenderos, and\r\nany others, in respect to the said entrances and pacifications, they\r\nto make them wholly or partly at their own cost, as seems advisable to\r\nyou; and to give them title, for a limited time, as governors of the\r\nislands or provinces that they explore or pacify, and as captains and\r\nmasters-of-camp, providing you do not give them title as adelantado\r\nor mariscal. You shall advise me of it, when anyone undertakes this,\r\nreporting the services, capacity, and merits of such person. The said\r\ncovenant and agreement which you shall make may be kept in force until\r\nI approve them, because time will be saved thus--but with the condition\r\nof sending them to me, so that I may confirm them. You shall bind the\r\nparties to the agreement, upon the arrival of the said confirmations,\r\nto some brief period, such as you may assign for it.\r\n\r\n49. I have been told that, although a few of the encomenderos of\r\nthe said islands, who fear God and their consciences, are trying to\r\nestablish ministers of religious instruction in their encomiendas,\r\nothers are not doing this, and refuse to do it as they are obliged,\r\nand as is advisable, notwithstanding that there are plenty of the\r\nsaid ministers; that there are encomiendas which have been paying\r\ntribute peacefully for fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years, without\r\nthe Indians of them ever having seen a minister or heard a word\r\nof Christian instruction; and that also many other encomiendas pay\r\ntribute by pure force of soldiers and arquebuses, who rebel and revolt\r\nbecause of the oppression and severity with which they are treated,\r\nwithout knowing the reason why they should pay it, since they have no\r\ninstruction. Since, besides the obligation to procure the welfare of\r\nthose souls, their conversion, instruction, and teaching, which should\r\nbe the chief constraining force; and since even for temporal affairs,\r\nfor the peace and tranquillity of the country, so that those pacified\r\nshould not revolt, and so that those in revolt should be subdued, the\r\nbest method is that of instruction--for which the common treatment,\r\nmildness, upright life, and counsels of the religious and ministers\r\nof the gospel incline and regulate their minds: therefore I charge you\r\nthat, after consulting with the bishop you shall, in my name, provide\r\nwhat is advisable in this, so that the necessary instruction may be\r\nfurnished, that my conscience, and his, and your own may be relieved.\r\n\r\n50. I have also been informed that, in collecting the tributes from the\r\nIndians, there has been in the past, and is at present, great disorder,\r\nbecause the former governors of the said islands have done things very\r\nconfusedly and haphazardly.  Because the tribute of each Indian is\r\nof the value of eight reals, paid in what the Indian might possess,\r\nsome persons take advantage of certain words of the said assessments,\r\nand of the articles in which tributes are designated--such as cotton\r\ncloth, rice, and other products of the country--to cause the said\r\nlawlessness. This disorder has consisted in each one collecting\r\nwhatever he wished, to the great offense and injury of the said\r\nIndians; for when gold is abundant, their encomenderos demand coin\r\nfrom the Indians; and when coin is abundant and gold scarce, they\r\ndemand gold, although the said Indians have to search for and buy\r\nit. In short, they always demand their tributes in those things which\r\nare scarce, by reason of which, for the tribute worth eight reals,\r\nsome collect fifteen, and others twenty, twenty-five, thirty, and\r\nmore, according to the value of those things that are demanded. They\r\ncause the Indians to seek them and bring them from other parts, to\r\ntheir great vexation and affliction. It is advisable to check this\r\nlawlessness and excess. Therefore I charge you to ordain that, in\r\nthe payment of the said tributes, the order referred to in section\r\nsix of these instructions shall be observed. That section treats\r\nof the Indians being allowed to pay their tributes in coin, gold,\r\nor products, as they may choose.\r\n\r\n51. Another section of the said memorial also pointed out that,\r\nalthough certain Spaniards of tender conscience have freed their\r\nslaves, native to the said islands, in fulfilment of the provision\r\nof my decrees, many others have retained them, and do not allow\r\nthem to have houses of their own, or to live on their own land under\r\nthe ordinary instruction. It is advisable to remedy this also; and\r\nI therefore commit it to you, and order you that, immediately upon\r\nyour arrival at the said islands, you shall set at liberty all those\r\nIndians held as slaves by the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n52. I am informed that the said Indians have suffered many grievances\r\nand burdens from all the ministers of justice, because the latter\r\nhave incited many suits, not only of cases after the country was\r\ndiscovered, but of others that had happened in its pagan days,\r\namong both the living and their forefathers, and both civil and\r\ncriminal cases. These are not summary, but have all the terms,\r\ndemands, preliminary hearings, and reviews, which can be found in any\r\nchancilleria of these kingdoms. In these the Indians have wasted and\r\ncontinue to waste their possessions. Although in section twenty-nine\r\nof these instructions, it treats of what you and the bishop have to do\r\nor provide as a remedy for these vexations of suits by Spaniards and\r\nIndians, once more I charge you and recommend you to strive to have\r\nthe suits finished and decided promptly and summarily. You must take\r\nnote that this will be one of the matters in which I shall consider\r\nmyself most faithfully and fully served by you.\r\n\r\n53. In regard to the confusion existing, past and present, in the\r\nreligious leaving the said islands for the mainland of China and other\r\nplaces, without permission of the governor or bishop--asserting that,\r\nthrough their all-sufficient power, those who hinder them shall be\r\nexcommunicated--the advisable course has also been pointed out in time\r\npast--namely, that the religious should go there with the resolution\r\nto settle in the said Philipinas Islands, and not go elsewhere without\r\nyour permission and that of the said bishop. This must be construed\r\nin respect to the religious who shall have been assigned to make a\r\nsettlement and to live there, and not with those who have license\r\nfrom me to pass farther and to go to other regions; for when this is\r\ngiven or permitted to them, it is after much consideration.\r\n\r\n54. It has been said that, for the remedy of past confusion and\r\nwrongs, which have resulted from people going from the said islands\r\nto China and other districts without order or permission, it would be\r\nadvisable to ordain, under severe penalties, that no secular Spaniard\r\nmay leave them for any place or on any business, or supply a fragata,\r\nprovisions, or any other assistance to any of the said religious,\r\nwithout my special order, or your permission and that of the said\r\nbishop. Inasmuch as this fits in with the provision of the above\r\nsection, the same provision there is to be noted by you, so that\r\nlikewise you may know what pertains to this, and doing that you shall\r\nunderstand it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nYou shall attend to all of the above with the care and close attention\r\nthat I expect from your character and prudence, and from your earnest\r\nzeal in affairs touching my service. San Lorenço, August nine, one\r\nthousand five hundred and eighty-nine.\r\n\r\n_I The King_\r\n\r\nBy order of the king, our sovereign:\r\n\r\n_Juan de Ybarra_\r\n\r\nCountersigned by the council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCustoms of the Tagalogs\r\n\r\n(_Two Relations by Juan de Plasencia, O.S.F._)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter receiving your Lordship's letter, I wished to reply immediately;\r\nbut I postponed my answer in order that I might first thoroughly\r\ninform myself in regard to your request, and to avoid discussing\r\nthe conflicting reports of the Indians, who are wont to tell what\r\nsuits their purpose. Therefore, to this end, I collected Indians from\r\ndifferent districts--old men, and those of most capacity, all known\r\nto me; and from them I have obtained the simple truth, after weeding\r\nout much foolishness, in regard to their government, administration\r\nof justice, inheritances, slaves, and dowries. [25] It is as follows:\r\n\r\n_Customs of the Tagalogs_\r\n\r\nThis people always had chiefs, called by them _datos_, who governed\r\nthem and were captains in their wars, and whom they obeyed and\r\nreverenced. The subject who committed any offense against them,\r\nor spoke but a word to their wives and children, was severely punished.\r\n\r\nThese chiefs ruled over but few people; sometimes as many as\r\na hundred houses, sometimes even less than thirty. This tribal\r\ngathering is called in Tagalo a _barangay_. It was inferred that the\r\nreason for giving themselves this name arose from the fact (as they\r\nare classed, by their language, among the Malay nations) that when\r\nthey came to this land, the head of the barangay, which is a boat,\r\nthus called--as is discussed at length in the first chapter of the\r\nfirst ten chapters--became a _dato_. And so, even at the present day,\r\nit is ascertained that this barangay in its origin was a family of\r\nparents and children, relations and slaves. There were many of these\r\nbarangays in each town, or, at least, on account of wars, they did\r\nnot settle far from one another. They were not, however, subject to\r\none another, except in friendship and relationship. The chiefs, in\r\ntheir various wars, helped one another with their respective barangays.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the chiefs, who corresponded to our knights, there\r\nwere three castes: nobles, commoners, and slaves. The nobles were the\r\nfree-born whom they call _maharlica_. They did not pay tax or tribute\r\nto the dato, but must accompany him in war, at their own expense. The\r\nchief offered them beforehand a feast, and afterward they divided\r\nthe spoils. Moreover, when the dato went upon the water those whom he\r\nsummoned rowed for him. If he built a house, they helped him, and had\r\nto be fed for it. The same was true when the whole barangay went to\r\nclear up his lands for tillage. The lands which they inhabited were\r\ndivided among the whole barangay, especially the irrigated portion,\r\nand thus each one knew his own. No one belonging to another barangay\r\nwould cultivate them unless after purchase or inheritance. The lands\r\non the _tingues_, or mountain-ridges, are not divided, but owned in\r\ncommon by the barangay. Consequently, at the time of the rice harvest,\r\nany individual of any particular barangay, although he may have come\r\nfrom some other village, if he commences to clear any land may sow it,\r\nand no one can compel him to abandon it. There are some villages (as,\r\nfor example, Pila de la Laguna) in which these nobles, or maharlicas,\r\npaid annually to the dato a hundred gantas of rice. The reason of this\r\nwas that, at the time of their settlement there, another chief occupied\r\nthe lands, which the new chief, upon his arrival, bought with his own\r\ngold; and therefore the members of his barangay paid him for the arable\r\nland, and he divided it, among those whom he saw fit to reward. But\r\nnow, since the advent of the Spaniards, it is not so divided.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs in some villages had also fisheries, with established\r\nlimits, and sections of the rivers for markets. At these no one could\r\nfish, or trade in the markets, without paying for the privilege,\r\nunless he belonged to the chief's barangay or village.\r\n\r\nThe commoners are called _aliping namamahay_. They are married, and\r\nserve their master, whether he be a dato or not, with half of their\r\ncultivated lands, as was agreed upon in the beginning. They accompanied\r\nhim whenever he went beyond the island, and rowed for him. They live\r\nin their own houses, and are lords of their property and gold. Their\r\nchildren inherit it, and enjoy their property and lands. The children,\r\nthen, enjoy the rank of their fathers, and they cannot be made slaves\r\n(_sa guiguilir_) nor can either parents or children be sold. If they\r\nshould fall by inheritance into the hands of a son of their master who\r\nwas going to dwell in another village, they could not be taken from\r\ntheir own village and carried with him; but they would remain in their\r\nnative village, doing service there and cultivating the sowed lands.\r\n\r\nThe slaves are called _aliping sa guiguilir_. They serve their master\r\nin his house and on his cultivated lands, and may be sold. The master\r\ngrants them, should he see fit, and providing that he has profited\r\nthrough their industry, a portion of their harvests, so that they\r\nmay work faithfully. For these reasons, servants who are born in the\r\nhouse of their master are rarely, if ever, sold. That is the lot of\r\ncaptives in war, and of those brought up in the harvest fields.\r\n\r\nThose to whom a debt was owed transferred the debt to another, thereby\r\nthemselves making a profit, and reducing the wretched debtors to a\r\nslavery which was not their natural lot. If any person among those\r\nwho were made slaves (_sa guiguilir_)--through war, by the trade of\r\ngoldsmith, or otherwise--happened to possess any gold beyond the sum\r\nthat he had to give his master, he ransomed himself, becoming thus\r\na _namamahay_, or what we call a commoner. The price of this ransom\r\nwas never less than five taels, and from that upwards; and if he gave\r\nten or more taels, as they might agree, he became wholly free. An\r\namusing ceremony accompanied this custom. After having divided all\r\nthe trinkets which the slave possessed, if he maintained a house of\r\nhis own, they divided even the pots and jars, and if an odd one of\r\nthese remained, they broke it; and if a piece of cloth were left,\r\nthey parted it in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the _aliping namamahay_ and the _aliping sa\r\nguiguilir_, should be noted; for, by a confusion of the two terms,\r\nmany have been classed as slaves who really are not. The Indians seeing\r\nthat the alcaldes-mayor do not understand this, have adopted the custom\r\nof taking away the children of the _aliping namamahay_, making use\r\nof them as they would of the _aliping sa guiguilir_, as servants in\r\ntheir households, which is illegal, and if the _aliping namamahay_\r\nshould appeal to justice, it is proved that he is an _aliping_ as\r\nwell as his father and mother before him and no reservation is made\r\nas to whether he is _aliping namamahay_ or _atiping sa guiguilir_. He\r\nis at once considered an _alipin_, without further declaration. In\r\nthis way he becomes a _sa guiguilir_, and is even sold. Consequently,\r\nthe alcaldes-mayor should be instructed to ascertain, when anyone\r\nasks for his _alipin_, to which class he belongs, and to have the\r\nanswer put in the document that they give him.\r\n\r\nIn these three classes, those who are _maharlicas_ on both the father's\r\nand mother's side continue to be so forever; and if it happens that\r\nthey should become slaves, it is through marriage, as I shall soon\r\nexplain. If these maharlicas had children among their slaves, the\r\nchildren and their mothers became free; if one of them had children\r\nby the slave-woman of another, she was compelled, when pregnant, to\r\ngive her master half of a gold tael, because of her risk of death,\r\nand for her inability to labor during the pregnancy. In such a case\r\nhalf of the child was free--namely, the half belonging to the father,\r\nwho supplied the child with food. If he did not do this, he showed\r\nthat he did not recognize him as his child, in which case the latter\r\nwas wholly a slave. If a free woman had children by a slave, they\r\nwere all free, provided he were not her husband.\r\n\r\nIf two persons married, of whom one was a _maharlica_ and the other\r\na slave, whether _namamahay_ or _sa guiguilir_, the children were\r\ndivided: the first, whether male or female, belonged to the father,\r\nas did the third and fifth; the second, the fourth, and the sixth\r\nfell to the mother, and so on. In this manner, if the father were\r\nfree, all those who belonged to him were free; if he were a slave,\r\nall those who belonged to him were slaves; and the same applied to\r\nthe mother. If there should not be more than one child he was half\r\nfree and half slave. The only question here concerned the division,\r\nwhether the child were male or female. Those who became slaves fell\r\nunder the category of servitude which was their parent's, either\r\nnamamahay or sa guiguilir. If there were an odd number of children,\r\nthe odd one was half free and half slave. I have not been able to\r\nascertain with any certainty when or at what age the division of\r\nchildren was made, for each one suited himself in this respect. Of\r\nthese two kinds of slaves the sa guiguilir could be sold, but not the\r\nnamamahay and their children, nor could they be transferred. However,\r\nthey could be transferred from the barangay by inheritance, provided\r\nthey remained in the same village.\r\n\r\nThe maharlicas could not, after marriage, move from one village to\r\nanother, or from one barangay to another, without paying a certain\r\nfine in gold, as arranged among them. This fine was larger or smaller\r\naccording to the inclination of the different villages, running from\r\none to three taels and a banquet to the entire barangay. Failure\r\nto pay the fine might result in a war between the barangay which\r\nthe person left and the one which he entered. This applied equally\r\nto men and women, except that when one married a woman of another\r\nvillage, the children were afterwards divided equally between the two\r\nbarangays. This arrangement kept them obedient to the dato, or chief,\r\nwhich is no longer the case--because, if the dato is energetic and\r\ncommands what the religious fathers enjoin him, they soon leave him\r\nand go to other villages and other datos, who endure and protect them\r\nand do not order them about. This is the kind of dato that they now\r\nprefer, not him who has the spirit to command. There is a great need\r\nof reform in this, for the chiefs are spiritless and faint-hearted.\r\n\r\nInvestigations made and sentences passed by the dato must take place\r\nin the presence of those of his barangay. If any of the litigants\r\nfelt himself aggrieved, an arbiter was unanimously named from\r\nanother village or barangay, whether he were a dato or not; since\r\nthey had for this purpose some persons, known as fair and just men,\r\nwho were said to give true judgment according to their customs. If the\r\ncontroversy lay between two chiefs, when they wished to avoid war,\r\nthey also convoked judges to act as arbiters; they did the same if\r\nthe disputants belonged to two different barangays. In this ceremony\r\nthey always had to drink, the plaintiff inviting the others.\r\n\r\nThey had laws by which they condemned to death a man of low birth\r\nwho insulted the daughter or wife of a chief; likewise witches,\r\nand others of the same class.\r\n\r\nThey condemned no one to slavery, unless he merited the\r\ndeath-penalty. As for the witches, they killed them, and their\r\nchildren and accomplices became slaves of the chief, after he had\r\nmade some recompense to the injured person. All other offenses\r\nwere punished by fines in gold, which, if not paid with promptness,\r\nexposed the culprit to serve, until the payment should be made, the\r\nperson aggrieved, to whom the money was to be paid. This was done in\r\nthe following way: Half the cultivated lands and all their produce\r\nbelonged to the master. The master provided the culprit with food and\r\nclothing, thus enslaving the culprit and his children until such time\r\nas he might amass enough money to pay the fine. If the father should\r\nby chance pay his debt, the master then claimed that he had fed and\r\nclothed his children, and should be paid therefor. In this way he kept\r\npossession of the children if the payment could not be met. This last\r\nwas usually the case, and they remained slaves. If the culprit had\r\nsome relative or friend who paid for him, he was obliged to render\r\nthe latter half his service until he was paid--not, however, service\r\nwithin the house as aliping sa guiguilir, but living independently,\r\nas aliping namamahay. If the creditor were not served in this wise,\r\nthe culprit had to pay the double of what was lent him. In this way\r\nslaves were made by debt: either sa guiguilir, if they served the\r\nmaster to whom the judgment applied; or aliping namamahay, if they\r\nserved the person who lent them wherewith to pay.\r\n\r\nIn what concerns loans, there was formerly, and is today, an excess of\r\nusury, which is a great hindrance to baptism as well as to confession;\r\nfor it turns out in the same way as I have showed in the case of the\r\none under judgment, who gives half of his cultivated lands and profits\r\nuntil he pays the debt. The debtor is condemned to a life of toil;\r\nand thus borrowers become slaves, and after the death of the father\r\nthe children pay the debt. Not doing so, double the amount must be\r\npaid. This system should and can be reformed.\r\n\r\nAs for inheritances, the legitimate children of a father and mother\r\ninherited equally, except in the case where the father and mother\r\nshowed a slight partiality by such gifts as two or three gold taels,\r\nor perhaps a jewel.\r\n\r\nWhen the parents gave a dowry to any son, and, when, in order to\r\nmarry him to a chief's daughter, the dowry was greater than the\r\nsum given the other sons, the excess was not counted in the whole\r\nproperty to be divided. But any other thing that should have been\r\ngiven to any son, though it might be for some necessity, was taken\r\ninto consideration at the time of the partition of the property,\r\nunless the parents should declare that such a bestowal was made\r\noutside of the inheritance. If one had had children by two or more\r\nlegitimate wives, each child received the inheritance and dowry of\r\nhis mother, with its increase, and that share of his father's estate\r\nwhich fell to him out of the whole. If a man had a child by one of his\r\nslaves, as well as legitimate children, the former had no share in\r\nthe inheritance; but the legitimate children were bound to free the\r\nmother, and to give him something--a tael or a slave, if the father\r\nwere a chief; or if, finally, anything else were given it was by the\r\nunanimous consent of all. If besides his legitimate children, he had\r\nalso some son by a free unmarried woman, to whom a dowry was given\r\nbut who was not considered as a real wife, all these were classed as\r\nnatural children, although the child by the unmarried woman should\r\nhave been begotten after his marriage. Such children did not inherit\r\nequally with the legitimate children, but only the third part. For\r\nexample, if there were two children, the legitimate one had two parts,\r\nand the one of the _inaasava_ one part. When there were no children\r\nby a legitimate wife, but only children by an unmarried woman, or\r\n_inaasava_, the latter inherited all. If he had a child by a slave\r\nwoman, that child received his share as above stated. If there were\r\nno legitimate or natural child, or a child by an inaasava, whether\r\nthere was a son of a slave woman or not, the inheritance went only\r\nto the father or grandparents, brothers, or nearest relatives of the\r\ndeceased, who gave to the slave-child as above stated.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a child by a free married woman, born while she was\r\nmarried, if the husband punished the adulterer this was considered\r\na dowry; and the child entered with the others into partition in the\r\ninheritance. His share equaled the part left by the father, nothing\r\nmore. If there were no other sons than he, the children and the nearest\r\nrelatives inherited equally with him. But if the adulterer were not\r\npunished by the husband of the woman who had the child, the latter\r\nwas not considered as his child, nor did he inherit anything. It\r\nshould be noticed that the offender was not considered dishonored\r\nby the punishment inflicted, nor did the husband leave the woman. By\r\nthe punishment of the father the child was fittingly made legitimate.\r\n\r\nAdopted children, of whom there are many among them, inherit the\r\ndouble of what was paid for their adoption. For example, if one gold\r\ntael was given that he might be adopted when the first father died,\r\nthe child was given [in inheritance] two taels. But if this child\r\nshould die first, his children do not inherit from the second father,\r\nfor the arrangement stops at that point.\r\n\r\nThis is the danger to which his money is exposed, as well as his being\r\nprotected as a child. On this account this manner of adoption common\r\namong them is considered lawful.\r\n\r\nDowries are given by the men to the women's parents. If the latter are\r\nliving, they enjoy the use of it. At their death, provided the dowry\r\nhas not been consumed, it is divided like the rest of the estate,\r\nequally among the children, except in case the father should care to\r\nbestow something additional upon the daughter. If the wife, at the\r\ntime of her marriage, has neither father, mother, nor grandparents,\r\nshe enjoys her dowry--which, in such a case, belongs to no other\r\nrelative or child. It should be noticed that unmarried women can own\r\nno property, in land or dowry, for the result of all their labors\r\naccrues to their parents.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a divorce before the birth of children, if the wife left\r\nthe husband for the purpose of marrying another, all her dowry and\r\nan equal additional amount fell to the husband; but if she left him,\r\nand did not marry another, the dowry was returned. When the husband\r\nleft his wife, he lost the half of the dowry, and the other half was\r\nreturned to him. If he possessed children at the time of his divorce,\r\nthe whole dowry and the fine went to the children, and was held for\r\nthem by their grandparents or other responsible relatives.\r\n\r\nI have also seen another practice in two villages. In one case, upon\r\nthe death of the wife who in a year's time had borne no children,\r\nthe parents returned one-half the dowry to the husband whose wife had\r\ndied. In the other case, upon the death of the husband, one-half the\r\ndowry was returned to the relatives of the husband. I have ascertained\r\nthat this is not a general practice; for upon inquiry I learned that\r\nwhen this is done it is done through piety, and that all do not do it.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of marriage dowries which fathers bestow upon their\r\nsons when they are about to be married, and half of which is given\r\nimmediately, even when they are only children, there is a great deal\r\nmore complexity. There is a fine stipulated in the contract, that he\r\nwho violates it shall pay a certain sum which varies according to the\r\npractice of the village and the affluence of the individual. The fine\r\nwas heaviest if, upon the death of the parents, the son or daughter\r\nshould be unwilling to marry because it had been arranged by his or\r\nher parents. In this case the dowry which the parents had received\r\nwas returned and nothing more. But if the parents were living, they\r\npaid the fine, because it was assumed that it had been their design\r\nto separate the children.\r\n\r\nThe above is what I have been able to ascertain clearly concerning\r\ncustoms observed among these natives in all this Laguna and the\r\ntingues, and among the entire Tagalo race. The old men say that a\r\ndato who did anything contrary to this would not be esteemed; and,\r\nin relating tyrannies which they had committed, some condemned them\r\nand adjudged them wicked.\r\n\r\nOthers, perchance, may offer a more extended narrative, but leaving\r\naside irrelevant matters concerning government and justice among them,\r\na summary of the whole truth is contained in the above. I am sending\r\nthe account in this clear and concise form because I had received no\r\norders to pursue the work further. Whatever may be decided upon, it is\r\ncertainly important that it should be given to the alcal-des-mayor,\r\naccompanied by an explanation; for the absurdities which are to be\r\nfound in their opinions are indeed pitiable.\r\n\r\nMay our Lord bestow upon your Lordship His grace and spirit, so that in\r\nevery step good fortune may be yours; and upon every occasion may your\r\nLordship deign to consider me your humble servant, to be which would\r\nbe the greatest satisfaction and favor that I could receive. Nagcarlán,\r\nOctober 21, 1589.\r\n\r\n_Fray Juan de Plasencia_ [26]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of the Worship of the Tagalogs, Their Gods, and Their\r\nBurials and Superstitions_\r\n\r\nIn all the villages, or in other parts of the Filipinas Islands,\r\nthere are no temples consecrated to the performing of sacrifices,\r\nthe adoration of their idols, or the general practice of idolatry. It\r\nis true that they have the name _simbahan_, which means a temple or\r\nplace of adoration; but this is because, formerly, when they wished to\r\ncelebrate a festival, which they called _pandot_, or \"worship,\" they\r\ncelebrated it in the large house of a chief. There they constructed,\r\nfor the purpose of sheltering the assembled people, a temporary shed\r\non each side of the house, with a roof, called _sibi_, to protect the\r\npeople from the wet when it rained. They so constructed the house\r\nthat it might contain many people--dividing it, after the fashion\r\nof ships, into three compartments. On the posts of the house they\r\nset small lamps, called _sorihile_; in the center of the house they\r\nplaced one large lamp, adorned with leaves of the white palm, wrought\r\ninto many designs. They also brought together many drums, large and\r\nsmall, which they beat successively while the feast lasted, which was\r\nusually four days. During this time the whole barangay, or family,\r\nunited and joined in the worship which they call _nagaanitos_. The\r\nhouse, for the above-mentioned period of time, was called a temple.\r\n\r\nAmong their many idols there was one called. Badhala, whom they\r\nespecially worshiped. The title seems to signify \"all powerful,\"\r\nor \"maker of all things.\" They also worshiped the sun, which, on\r\naccount of its beauty, is almost universally respected and honored by\r\nheathens. They worshiped, too, the moon, especially when it was new,\r\nat which time they held great rejoicings, adoring it and bidding it\r\nwelcome. Some of them also adored the stars, although they did not\r\nknow them by their names, as the Spaniards and other nations know the\r\nplanets--with the one exception of the morning star, which they called\r\nTala. They knew, too, the \"seven little goats\" [the Pleiades]--as\r\nwe call them--and, consequently, the change of seasons, which they\r\ncall Mapolon; and Balatic, which is our Greater Bear. They possessed\r\nmany idols called _lic-ha_, which were images with different shapes;\r\nand at times they worshiped any little trifle, in which they adored,\r\nas did the Romans, some particular dead man who was brave in war and\r\nendowed with special faculties, to whom they commended themselves for\r\nprotection in their tribulations. They had another idol called Dian\r\nmasalanta, who was the patron of lovers and of generation. The idols\r\ncalled Lacapati and Idianale were the patrons of the cultivated lands\r\nand of husbandry. They paid reverence to water-lizards called by them\r\n_buaya_, or crocodiles, from fear of being harmed by them. They were\r\neven in the habit of offering these animals a portion of what they\r\ncarried in their boats, by throwing it into the water, or placing it\r\nupon the bank.\r\n\r\nThey were, moreover, very liable to find auguries in things they\r\nwitnessed. For example, if they left their house and met on the\r\nway a serpent or rat, or a bird called _Tigmamanuguin_ which was\r\nsinging in the tree, or if they chanced upon anyone who sneezed,\r\nthey returned at once to their house, considering the incident as an\r\naugury that some evil might befall them if they should continue their\r\njourney--especially when the above-mentioned bird sang. This song had\r\ntwo different forms: in the one case it was considered as an evil\r\nomen; in the other, as a good omen, and then they continued their\r\njourney. They also practiced divination, to see whether weapons,\r\nsuch as a dagger or knife, were to be useful and lucky for their\r\npossessor whenever occasion should offer.\r\n\r\nThese natives had no established division of years, months, and days;\r\nthese are determined by the cultivation of the soil, counted by moons,\r\nand the different effect produced upon the trees when yielding flowers,\r\nfruits, and leaves: all this helps them in making up the year. The\r\nwinter and summer are distinguished as sun-time and water-time--the\r\nlatter term designating winter in those regions, where there is no\r\ncold, snow, or ice.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that now since they have become Christians, the\r\nseasons are not quite the same, for at Christmas it gets somewhat\r\ncooler. The years, since the advent of the Spaniards, have been\r\ndetermined by the latter, and the seasons have been given their proper\r\nnames, and they have been divided into weeks.\r\n\r\nTheir manner of offering sacrifice was to proclaim a feast, and offer\r\nto the devil what they had to eat. This was done in front of the idol,\r\nwhich they anoint with fragrant perfumes, such as musk and civet,\r\nor gum of the storax-tree and other odoriferous woods, and praise it\r\nin poetic songs sung by the officiating priest, male or female, who\r\nis called _catolonan_. The participants made responses to the song,\r\nbeseeching the idol to favor them with those things of which they\r\nwere in need, and generally, by offering repeated healths, they all\r\nbecame intoxicated. In some of their idolatries they were accustomed\r\nto place a good piece of cloth, doubled, over the idol, and over the\r\ncloth a chain or large, gold ring, thus worshiping the devil without\r\nhaving sight of him. The devil was sometimes liable to enter into\r\nthe body of the catolonan, and, assuming her shape and appearance,\r\nfilled her with so great arrogance--he being the cause of it--that\r\nshe seemed to shoot flames from her eyes; her hair stood on end, a\r\nfearful sight to those beholding, and she uttered words of arrogance\r\nand superiority. In some districts, especially in the mountains, when\r\nin those idolatries the devil incarnated himself and took on the form\r\nof his minister, the latter had to be tied to a tree by his companions,\r\nto prevent the devil in his infernal fury from destroying him. This,\r\nhowever, happened but rarely. The objects of sacrifice were goats,\r\nfowls, and swine, which were flayed, decapitated, and laid before\r\nthe idol. They performed another ceremony by cooking a jar of rice\r\nuntil the water was evaporated, after which they broke the jar, and\r\nthe rice was left as an intact mass which was set before the idol;\r\nand all about it, at intervals, were placed a few buyos--which is a\r\nsmall fruit [27] wrapped in a leaf with some lime, a food generally\r\neaten in these regions--as well as fried food and fruits. All the\r\nabove-mentioned articles were eaten by the guests at the feast; the\r\nheads [of the animals], after being \"offered,\" as they expressed it,\r\nwere cooked and eaten also.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for offering this sacrifice and adoration were, in addition\r\nto whatever personal matters there might be, the recovery of a sick\r\nperson, the prosperous voyage of those embarking on the sea, a good\r\nharvest in the sowed lands, a propitious result in wars, a successful\r\ndelivery in childbirth, and a happy outcome in married life. If this\r\ntook place among people of rank, the festivities lasted thirty days.\r\n\r\nIn the case of young girls who first had their monthly courses, their\r\neyes were blindfolded four days and four nights; and, in the meantime,\r\nthe friends and relatives were all invited to partake of food and\r\ndrink. At the end of this period, the catolonan took the young girl\r\nto the water, bathed her and washed her head, and removed the bandage\r\nfrom her eyes. The old men said that they did this in order that the\r\ngirls might bear children, and have fortune in finding husbands to\r\ntheir taste, who would not leave them widows in their youth.\r\n\r\nThe distinctions made among the priests of the devil were as follows:\r\nThe first, called catolonan, as above stated, was either a man or a\r\nwoman. This office was an honorable one among the natives, and was\r\nheld ordinarily by people of rank, this rule being general in all\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\nThe second they called _mangagauay_, or witches, who deceived by\r\npretending to heal the sick. These priests even induced maladies by\r\ntheir charms, which in proportion to the strength and efficacy of the\r\nwitchcraft, are capable of causing death. In this way, if they wished\r\nto kill at once they did so; or they could prolong life for a year\r\nby binding to the waist a live serpent, which was believed to be the\r\ndevil, or at least his substance. This office was general throughout\r\nthe land. The third they called _manyisalat_, which is the same as\r\nmagagauay. These priests had the power of applying such remedies to\r\nlovers that they would abandon and despise their own wives, and in\r\nfact could prevent them from having intercourse with the latter. If\r\nthe woman, constrained by these means, were abandoned, it would bring\r\nsickness upon her; and on account of the desertion she would discharge\r\nblood and matter. This office was also general throughout the land.\r\n\r\nThe fourth was called _mancocolam_, whose duty it was to emit fire\r\nfrom himself at night, once or oftener each month. This fire could\r\nnot be extinguished; nor could it be thus emitted except as the priest\r\nwallowed in the ordure and filth which falls from the houses; and he\r\nwho lived in the house where the priest was wallowing in order to emit\r\nthis fire from himself, fell ill and died. This office was general.\r\n\r\nThe fifth was called _hocloban_, which is another kind of witch, of\r\ngreater efficacy than the mangagauay. Without the use of medicine,\r\nand by simply saluting or raising the hand, they killed whom they\r\nchose. But if they desired to heal those whom they had made ill by\r\ntheir charms, they did so by using other charms. Moreover, if they\r\nwished to destroy the house of some Indian hostile to them, they\r\nwere able to do so without instruments. This was in Catanduanes,\r\nan island off the upper part of Luzon.\r\n\r\nThe sixth was called _silagan_, whose office it was, if they saw anyone\r\nclothed in white, to tear out his liver and eat it, thus causing his\r\ndeath. This, like the preceding, was in the island of Catanduanes. Let\r\nno one, moreover, consider this a fable; because, in Calavan, they\r\ntore out in this way through the anus all the intestines of a Spanish\r\nnotary, who was buried in Calilaya by father Fray Juan de Mérida.\r\n\r\nThe seventh was called _magtatangal_, and his purpose was to show\r\nhimself at night to many persons, without his head or entrails. In\r\nsuch wise the devil walked about and carried, or pretended to carry,\r\nhis head to different places; and, in the morning, returned it to his\r\nbody--remaining, as before, alive. This seems to me to be a fable,\r\nalthough the natives affirm that they have seen it, because the devil\r\nprobably caused them so to believe. This occurred in Catanduanes.\r\n\r\nThe eighth they called _osuang_, which is equivalent to \"sorcerer;\"\r\nthey say that they have seen him fly, and that he murdered men and\r\nate their flesh. This was among the Visayas Islands; among the Tagalos\r\nthese did not exist.\r\n\r\nThe ninth was another class of witches called _mangagayoma_. They\r\nmade charms for lovers out of herbs, stones, and wood, which would\r\ninfuse the heart with love. Thus did they deceive the people, although\r\nsometimes, through the intervention of the devil, they gained their\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe tenth was known as _sonat_, which is equivalent to \"preacher.\" It\r\nwas his office to help one to die, at which time he predicted the\r\nsalvation or condemnation of the soul. It was not lawful for the\r\nfunctions of this office to be fulfilled by others than people of\r\nhigh standing, on account of the esteem in which it was held. This\r\noffice was general throughout the islands.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh, _pangatahojan_, was a soothsayer, and predicted the\r\nfuture. This office was general in all the islands.\r\n\r\nThe twelfth, _bayoguin_, signified a \"cotquean,\" a man whose nature\r\ninclined toward that of a woman.\r\n\r\nTheir manner of burying the dead was as follows: The deceased was\r\nburied beside his house; and, if he were a chief, he was placed beneath\r\na little house or porch which they constructed for this purpose. Before\r\ninterring him, they mourned him for four days; and afterward laid him\r\non a boat which served as a coffin or bier, placing him beneath the\r\nporch, where guard was kept over him by a slave. In place of rowers,\r\nvarious animals were placed within the boat, each one being assigned\r\na place at the oar by twos--male and female of each species being\r\ntogether--as for example two goats, two deer, or two fowls. It was\r\nthe slave's care to see that they were fed. If the deceased had\r\nbeen a warrior, a living slave was tied beneath his body until in\r\nthis wretched way he died. In course of time, all suffered decay;\r\nand for many days the relatives of the dead man bewailed him, singing\r\ndirges, and praises of his good qualities, until finally they wearied\r\nof it. This grief was also accompanied by eating and drinking. This\r\nwas a custom of the Tagalos.\r\n\r\nThe Aetas, [28] or Negrillos [Negritos] inhabitants of this island, had\r\nalso a form of burial, but different. They dug a deep, perpendicular\r\nhole, and placed the deceased within it, leaving him upright with head\r\nor crown unburied, on top of which they put half a cocoa-nut which was\r\nto serve him as a shield. Then they went in pursuit of some Indian,\r\nwhom they killed in retribution for the Negrillo who had died. To\r\nthis end they conspired together, hanging a certain token on their\r\nnecks until some one of them procured the death of the innocent one.\r\n\r\nThese infidels said that they knew that there was another life of\r\nrest which they called _maca_, just as if we should say \"paradise,\"\r\nor, in other words, \"village of rest.\" They say that those who go\r\nto this place are the just, and the valiant, and those who lived\r\nwithout doing harm, or who possessed other moral virtues. They\r\nsaid also that in the other life and mortality, there was a place\r\nof punishment, grief, and affliction, called _casanaan_, which was\r\n\"a place of anguish;\" they also maintained that no one would go to\r\nheaven, where there dwelt only Bathala, \"the maker of all things,\"\r\nwho governed from above. There were also other pagans who confessed\r\nmore clearly to a hell, which they called, as I have said, casanaan;\r\nthey said that all the wicked went to that place, and there dwelt\r\nthe demons, whom they called _sitan_.\r\n\r\nAll the various kinds of infernal ministers were, therefore, as has\r\nbeen stated: _catolonan; sonat_ (who was a sort of bishop who ordained\r\npriestesses and received their reverence, for they knelt before him as\r\nbefore one who could pardon sins, and expected salvation through him);\r\n_mangagauay, manyisalat, mancocolam, hocloban, silagan, magtatangal,\r\nosuan, mangagayoma, pangatahoan_. [29]\r\n\r\nThere were also ghosts, which they called _vibit_; and phantoms,\r\nwhich they called _Tigbalaang_. They had another deception--namely,\r\nthat if any woman died in childbirth, she and the child suffered\r\npunishment; and that, at night, she could be heard lamenting. This\r\nwas called _patianac_. May the honor and glory be God our Lord's,\r\nthat among all the Tagalos not a trace of this is left; and that\r\nthose who are now marrying do not even know what it is, thanks to\r\nthe preaching of the holy gospel, which has banished it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDocuments of 1590\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tLetter from Portugal to Felipe II.

Asensio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Portugal to Felipe II\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the king, our lord, succeeded to the crown of Portugal, there\r\nbegan to open a new commerce between the Philipinas Islands and the\r\nwestern Yndias belonging to the domain of Castilla and China, Maluco,\r\nAmboino, Banda, and other parts of the Portuguese conquest. As soon\r\nas this was known in the eastern Yndias, the viceroys and governors\r\nthereof were continually writing to his Majesty, that from this new\r\ncommerce many heavy injuries were sustained by his Majesty's service,\r\nin regard to the preservation and support of that state of eastern\r\nYndia, and the quiet of its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty after reading their letters and going over truthful\r\nreports of the great injury that the continuation of this new trade\r\nmight cause, both to the crown of Castilla and to that of Portugal,\r\nresolved to prohibit anyone from going from the western Yndias to\r\nChina, Maluco, Amboino, and Banda, and other places belonging to the\r\ncrown of Portugal; or from the Eastern to the Western Yndias. Decrees\r\nfor this prohibition, signed by his Majesty and by the Portuguese\r\nministers, were passed and sent to Yndia, where they were published\r\nand ordered to be observed under heavy penalties. The same was to be\r\ndone by the ministers of the crown of Castilla and certain memoranda\r\nof it were to be given. We do not know whether this has been done yet.\r\n\r\nBecause they have again written and continue to write from Yndia\r\nthat the said decrees prohibiting the said commerce are not being\r\nobserved by the Castilians, and because they everywhere encourage it\r\nand increase to a great extent the evils that result therefrom, which\r\nmight be very serious indeed, and difficult to remedy, and involve the\r\ntotal destruction and loss of those states: his Majesty ordered, for\r\nthe more thorough understanding of these details, that they should make\r\nthis report of the existing causes for not continuing this commerce,\r\nand even for prohibiting it. These reasons are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe state of Eastern Yndia is very large, and its cities and\r\ngarrisons very distant and remote from one another, and situated in\r\nthe territories of kings and princes of great power. On this account\r\nthey are maintained by regular soldiery and very powerful fleets, of\r\nlarge and small galleys and galleons. All the Portuguese resident in\r\nthose places, and other Christian vassals of his Majesty, easily bear\r\nthe excessive expense. The latter is made up by the income from those\r\ncities and strongholds. This income, although it exceeds a million, is\r\nnot sufficient to obviate its being always pledged. Some aid in money\r\nis sent from Portugal. This income from Yndia consists principally\r\nin imposts from the said cities, which are paid for entries and\r\nclearances. The entire amount of these imposts is raised on merchandise\r\nfrom China, Maluco, Amboino, Banda, and other regions of the south;\r\nfor the taxes that are raised on merchandise coming from the northern\r\ndistricts are of so much less importance, and the merchandise likewise,\r\nthat they cannot be compared with those of the south. The principal\r\ncommerce that the Portuguese have to live upon, is that from China\r\nand other southern districts, because the other traffic is contracted\r\nfor by his Majesty's treasury and belongs to it. The better and more\r\nvaluable trade through the southern districts belongs to the crown.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it may be inferred that if we continue this commerce\r\nwith China and other southern regions by way of the western Yndias,\r\nthe income from the customs duties, on which Yndia is supported,\r\nwill necessarily be lost. Nor will there be money or forces with which\r\nmany large fleets may be organized by his Majesty for its preservation\r\nand defense, or with which to pay the soldiery stationed there, or to\r\nbear all the other state expenses incurred by the public government,\r\nor those incurred by his Majesty for the ecclesiastical estate in\r\nthose places the conquest of which was granted to him by the apostolic\r\nbulls. The rest of these reasons which concern his Majesty's service,\r\nthe profit and loss of his treasury, and what is expedient for common\r\ngood of the inhabitants of that state, should be considered in this\r\ncase with the greatest care. For the inhabitants of Yndia have no\r\nother resources to live upon except trade and commerce; and of these\r\nthe principal is the trade with China and other places to which\r\nreference has been made. On this account, they feel very strongly\r\nthe seizure of this commerce by the Castilians, saying that they and\r\ntheir fathers and forefathers conquered it for the royal crown with\r\ntheir blood and lives. There are and were on this subject practices\r\nand complaints of base character, principally in the city of Goa,\r\nthe capital of that state.\r\n\r\nAnd even if all the above (in respect to what concerns Portugal and\r\nthe preservation and quiet of Yndia) were not of so great moment and\r\nconsideration for his Majesty's service, so great are the injuries\r\nto the crown of Castilla which result from this new commerce that\r\nonly for that (both for reasons of state and finance) it should be\r\nstrictly prohibited. For if navigation is permitted from the western\r\nIndias to China, all the money and coin in the kingdom will flow\r\nthither and none will go to Hespaña, because China is so large and\r\nhas so much to exchange and sell that, however much coin is sent,\r\nthat country will absorb it all. The Indias will come to have no need\r\nof Hespaña, because all the products obtained from this country can\r\nbe obtained from China in much greater abundance and more cheaply,\r\nexcept wines and olives, which can be very easily introduced in the\r\nYndias. They might also do without them, because they are not very\r\nnecessary or requisite. So they would care for trade with Hespaña\r\nonly on that account, especially since they may get them from China\r\nitself through the Portuguese traders. Of how much consequence and\r\nimportance this is in state matters, it is unnecessary to point out,\r\nbecause it may be well understood. It is, moreover, understood that\r\nthe Indians have wine of their own.\r\n\r\nAnd above all, when Chinese merchandise is in the western Indias and\r\nmoney is flowing toward China, trade and commerce with Hespaña will\r\nnecessarily fall off, together with the income of the custom house\r\nat Sevilla, while money will be scarce there and throughout España.\r\n\r\nLet it be further noted that among the sworn promises which his Majesty\r\nmade to the kingdom of Portugal, there is one clause (the copy of\r\nwhich accompanies this) in which it is said that traffic with Yndia,\r\nGuinea, and other regions belonging to the kingdom of Portugal, both\r\ndiscovered and to be discovered, will not be wrested from them or any\r\ninnovation made in present conditions; and the officials who are to\r\ngo out for the said commerce and on the ships for that purpose shall\r\nbe Portuguese. According to this clause, no alteration can be made\r\nin the commerce with China, Maluco, Amboino, Banda, and other parts\r\nof the Eastern Yndias. The Castilians shall not go there, nor shall\r\nthe Portuguese go from here to the Castilian Yndias. [30]\r\n\r\nThe Lord Cardinal Archduke, [31] to whom his Majesty has entrusted\r\nthe government of Portugal, seeing and considering all these dangers,\r\nwrote many times to his Majesty that it would be greatly to his\r\ninterest to prohibit this commerce; and besides what he says in\r\nmany of his letters, in one letter of December 23, of last year, 89,\r\nhe wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In this despatch is sent a report of all that has been written to your\r\nMajesty by the viceroy Don Duarte, and by the governor Miguel de Sosa,\r\nand other persons, affirming that it is of no use to your Majesty,\r\nand unsafe for the state of Yndia, to continue the commerce which has\r\nbegun to be opened from the Indias of the Castilian crown to China;\r\nand what your Majesty has had written in regard to it--in order that\r\nyour Majesty may have it examined. According to the information\r\nwhich I possess in this matter, I advise your Majesty to order,\r\nunder heavy penalties, that no one shall further this commerce from\r\nthe said districts to China, nor from China the other way, because it\r\nis known that if there is no remedy applied, we will lose the customs\r\nreceipts of the state of Yndia, and the trade of the merchants. It\r\nseems to me that the lack of confidence and the suspicion which the\r\nships and embarkations of the Castilians cause in the Chinese are of\r\neven greater consequence. The latter is referred to in the letter which\r\nthe city of Nombre de Dios wrote to your Majesty, on this matter.\"\r\n\r\nHereunto is added the copy of one clause from a letter by the governor\r\nof Yndia (which was received a few days ago, having come by land)\r\nthat what he says in regard to this matter, and the way in which this\r\ncommerce is looked upon there, may be known. He concludes by explaining\r\nhow well it suits his Majesty's service, and how advantageous it is\r\nto both Castilla and Portugal, to prohibit this commerce in such a\r\nway that all the ports shall be closed to it.\r\n\r\n\t\t       +\r\n\r\n[_Instructions_: \"On the new commerce of the Western Yndias, with\r\nChina. His Majesty orders that this shall be examined in the Council\r\nof the Indias. The Council shall then advise him of their opinion,\r\nso that his Majesty can determine what measures must be taken, before\r\nthe sailing of the ships. Pardo, March 3, 1590.\"] [32]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDecree Ordering a Grant to Salazar\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nFrom information received _de officio_ in the royal Audiencia of the\r\ncity of Manila, of the Philipinas Islands, and from the opinion of\r\nthe said Audiencia, it has been evident that, upon the arrival of\r\nthe bishop [Salazar] in the islands, all the houses were built of\r\nwood and bamboo, and thatched with straw. As he saw that they were\r\nburned frequently, and especially in the year eighty-three, when, in\r\nbut one fire, the city was nearly all destroyed including, with the\r\nproperty of the citizens, the cathedral church, monastery, hospital,\r\nfort, supplies, and artillery; seeing also the constant danger from\r\nfire and from the natives of whom there was great fear, the said\r\nbishop exerted himself to aid the citizens and soldiers with three\r\nthousand pesos of his own and others' money, dividing this sum among\r\nall of them, in order that they might rebuild their houses. By this\r\nmeans he relieved their extreme necessity, and afterward endeavored\r\nto persuade the governor and city to have the buildings constructed\r\nof stone and roofed with tile; and although everyone placed decided\r\nobstacles in the way, he set about this himself, and put great effort\r\ninto it, even to the seeking and opening of quarries, and procuring\r\nthe making of mortar and roof-tiles. Through his diligence, the result\r\nwas obtained and great increase followed therefrom to the said city,\r\nfor he built houses with the utmost toil and expense. Thereupon many\r\nof the citizens began to do the same, and the city has been made\r\nsafe and fortified. Now, a fort, hospital, church, and monasteries\r\nare being built--all of stone. In addition to the above, when he\r\nwent to those islands, he took altar-pieces, ornaments, and other\r\narticles of value for the service of divine worship; and afterward\r\nhe bought there some buildings for the church, at an expense of\r\neight hundred ducados. As, for both this and the bishopric, there is\r\nnothing left of the five hundred thousand maravedis paid him yearly\r\nfrom your Majesty's royal exchequer--which sum, even, has not been\r\npaid because there is no money there--he is deeply in debt and in\r\nneed. He beseeches your Majesty that, attentive to his great labors\r\nin the service of our Lord and of your Majesty, and for the good of\r\nthat state, your Majesty will bestow upon him a sum equal to what he\r\nhas spent, in order that he may pay his debts; and that he be given\r\nan order for it on the royal treasury of Mexico. The said Audiencia,\r\nin its opinion cited above, declares that his debts amount to six\r\nor seven thousand pesos; that his request seems to them very just;\r\nand that any concession made to him will be a great aid to the\r\nbishop. After deliberation in the council, it is our opinion that,\r\nin consideration of the above, a concession of three thousand pesos,\r\nthe equivalent of three thousand six hundred ducados, might be made\r\nthe said bishop, as an aid in paying his debts: this sum to be given\r\nhim once from the tributes of unassigned Indians in those islands,\r\nor from those that shall first become vacant. Your Majesty will act\r\nherein as suits your pleasure. Madrid, April xii, 1590.\r\n\r\n\t\t      +\r\n\r\n[_Endorsed_: \"Council of the Indias. April 12, 1590.

The orders of your royal\r\ndecrees and the ordinances of the royal Council have been observed\r\nwith all care. Whenever any trouble has arisen in the execution of\r\nthese decrees and ordinances, advice thereof has been given in the\r\nletters from this royal Audiencia, as your Majesty may see, should\r\nyou wish information thereof.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas, governor and\r\ncaptain-general of these islands, the president, auditors, and fiscal\r\nof this Audiencia ceased to exercise their duties, and the trials of\r\ncases pending in that body were suspended, so that, in accordance with\r\nthe orders of the royal decrees despatched in regard to this matter,\r\nthey might be concluded in the royal chancilleria of Mexico.\r\n\r\nDoctor Sanctiago de Vera, former president of this Audiencia, intended\r\nto go to Nueva España this year to assume his post as auditor in the\r\nroyal Audiencia of Mexico, to which your Majesty appointed him. Just as\r\nhe was about to embark, he was forced to remain here in these islands\r\nthis year, because of a certain very severe sickness of his wife, from\r\nwhich she nearly died. He will sail next year. Licentiate Pedro de\r\nRojas remains in these islands in the capacity of lieutenant-governor\r\nand counselor in government and military matters, in accordance with\r\nhis letters-patent. Although this country proves very unfavorable to\r\nhis health, so that he remains here at evident risk of life--because\r\nof a disease from which many die, and which has brought him twice\r\nor thrice to the verge of death--yet he thinks it his duty to\r\ncontinue his service to your Majesty here, and to remain at his post,\r\nnotwithstanding all the danger. We beg your Majesty kindly to appoint\r\nhim to another post elsewhere, where his health may be preserved,\r\nfor he has always suffered here from weakness and ill-health. Not only\r\nwould this prove to be an assurance of his life; his services, which\r\nare so acceptable and well-known, are such that he merits this favor\r\nfrom your Majesty. Inasmuch as he was auditor of this Audiencia, and\r\nthe oldest member of it, because of the death of the licentiate Abalos,\r\nhe should not be permitted to remain now as lieutenant-governor; for\r\nhe is a person of whom your Majesty can make use in the government,\r\nand in any post whatever of great importance and trust.\r\n\r\nThe licentiate Don Antonio de Rivera, auditor of this royal Audiencia,\r\nand the licentiate Ayala, [34] its fiscal, remain here without\r\noffice. They were detained here one year in order to be present\r\nin this city during the four months of their residencia. They are\r\nvery much disheartened over this, for they do not know to what post\r\nyour Majesty will appoint them. They have served in their respective\r\nposts in these islands during their whole term with care, integrity,\r\nand disinterestedness, that [_MS. illegible_] and they are suffering\r\nfrom so great necessity and are five thousand leagues distant from\r\nthose kingdoms, burdened with large families and households. They are\r\ngrieving greatly over the prospect of so long, dangerous, and costly a\r\nvoyage. We entreat your Majesty, since it is so just that rewards and\r\npromotions be given to your servants who have served you faithfully,\r\nand which your Majesty has ever been wont to bestow so generously, that\r\nyou do not permit them to remain unrewarded, and that you have their\r\nsalaries paid them from the time when their offices became vacant;\r\nfor their services merit this, as well as the eagerness with which\r\nthey have always exerted themselves, devoting all their energies to\r\nthe sole service of God and your Majesty. They have ceased to exercise\r\ntheir duties in-these posts--the best and chiefest of the kingdom--not\r\nthrough any demerit, but through the suppression of the Audiencia. We\r\ntrust that your Majesty will look favorably upon them and upon your\r\nother servants who have served you in this royal Audiencia; and that\r\nyou will reward them and promote them as we desire. May God preserve\r\nthe Catholic person of your Majesty.

Make a memorandum regarding\r\nthis auditor and fiscal.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chinese, and the Parian at Manila\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nAs Chinese matters are so worthy of being known, I have thought best\r\nto give your Majesty an account of them in a special letter, although\r\nall I say will be but little in comparison with the facts. Before I\r\nundertake to relate what God through His mercy has chosen to unfold to\r\nus concerning the affairs of that kingdom which were so hidden to us,\r\nI must, in order to ease my conscience, and die without this scruple,\r\nundo an error into which I had fallen for a while. Under that error I\r\nwrote to your Majesty as I felt then; and, although what I wrote was\r\ntrue, according to the information received, I have learned since that\r\nthe contrary is the fact. As soon as I began to see the error, I wrote\r\nto your Majesty; but it was not done with the necessary effectiveness,\r\nfor I was not yet completely undeceived. Now that I am, it would\r\nbe a very serious matter if I did not try to undo the deception. As\r\nat that time I wrote to your Majesty what I felt, under an erroneous\r\nimpression, I shall write what I feel, now that I am fully undeceived;\r\nfor one ought always to present the entire and naked truth, with no\r\nconfusing elements, to all men, and much more to your Majesty.\r\n\r\nBefore reaching these islands, I heard that no foreigner could without\r\ndanger of death set foot in the kingdom of China unless he received\r\nspecial permission from those having that kingdom in charge; and that\r\nthe native who took a foreigner into the land without permission would\r\nbe executed, and the foreigner sent to prison for life. When I reached\r\nthese islands, I first interviewed some Portuguese who came here,\r\nand I heard them declare and affirm the same thing which I had heard\r\nbefore. Since I had that impression at my coming, I easily believed\r\nwhat the Portuguese told me, and persuaded myself that it was true that\r\nno foreigner could enter China without risk of losing his life. For\r\na long time I have had the conversion of that kingdom at heart, and\r\nwith that thought I came to these islands. One of the reasons which\r\nmade me accept this bishopric was the fact that these islands were\r\nvery near China, and that many Chinese had come to live here. Being\r\ngrieved over the thought that by not allowing foreigners to set foot\r\nin that land the preaching of the gospel there might be hindered, I\r\ndrew up a report signed by many Portuguese witnesses from Macan and\r\nYndia who were here. In this report, which I sent to your Majesty,\r\nI gave evidence that the rulers of China, who are styled \"mandarins,\"\r\nallowed no one to enter the kingdom without their permission; and that\r\nfor this purpose they kept large fleets to guard the coast, and to kill\r\nor arrest all who land there. Relying upon the information given me by\r\nthe Portuguese, I wrote to your Majesty, asserting that it would be\r\njustifiable for your Majesty to send your fleet to that kingdom, and\r\nin case the preachers were denied entrance, to open a way by force,\r\nand make the Chinese receive them--it being understood that this\r\nopposition was from the mandarins alone, and that the common people\r\noffered no resistance and would receive them well. While all those in\r\nthe islands, including myself, held this view, it pleased our Lord to\r\nreveal this deception and to deliver us from this error. It so happened\r\nthat a ship left these islands for Mexico, and reached the coast of\r\nChina in distress. At first the crew were somewhat ill-treated by the\r\nsoldiers who guard the coast, because the latter had taken them for\r\nthieves or spies; but as soon as they were brought before the mandarin\r\ngovernor and it was learned that they had set out from the Lugones,\r\nas they call these islands, the governor treated them well, gave\r\norders to return what the soldiers had taken from them, and punished\r\nthose who had taken it. They sent the Spaniards in peace to Macan,\r\nwhence they came to this city. The captain of the ship is living here\r\nat the present day, as well as two Augustinians who were on board;\r\nand they have told me all that happened to them.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I began to be undeceived, and to understand that\r\nthe kingdom of China was not so inaccessible as the Portuguese had\r\nrepresented it. Then I wrote to your Majesty the aforesaid letter,\r\nasserting that the ill-report concerning the mandarins of China was\r\nrather an invention of the Portuguese than a true report. Later on, my\r\nbelief in this truth was confirmed by certain persons, both religious\r\nand laymen, who have gone to China from these islands. When these\r\npersons arrived there the Chinese arrested them, in order to find out\r\nwhence they came and what they were seeking; and when it was learned\r\nwho they were, they were allowed to return in peace and were even\r\ngiven supplies for the journey. While writing this, I have met two\r\nFranciscan friars who tell me that, as soon as they reached China,\r\nthey were arrested and taken, handcuffed, before the mandarin. When he\r\nlearned who they were he gave orders to set them free, and to provide\r\nfor their support until they could return here. What fully confirms\r\nme as to the truth of all this is the report which I received of the\r\nkind reception given in the province of Chincheo to a ship which\r\nthe viceroy then governing Nueba España sent to Macan, and whose\r\ncaptain was Lope de Palacios, the brother of the auditor Palacios,\r\nauditor of Mexico. This ship was driven to Chincheo under stress\r\nof weather, and there everyone in her was well received, when the\r\ninhabitants of Chincheo learned that they were coming to trade in\r\nChina. They persuaded them to go no farther, saying that they would\r\ngive them a cargo there for their ship; but God, who had chosen to\r\npunish those who by that means sought to destroy this land against\r\nthe wish of your Majesty, blinded them, so that they would not take\r\nthe most salutary advice that could have been given them. The three\r\nDominican religious who were on board the ship were well received and\r\nlovingly treated by the mandarin of that province. He took them to\r\nthe city and lodged them in his own house, giving them an apartment\r\nwhere they could celebrate mass. This they did with as much quiet\r\nand safety as if they had been at your court. The mandarin kept\r\nthem with him for one week, after which he allowed them to go to\r\ntheir ship and proceed to Macan. I had this relation from the very\r\nreligious who were there. At present I am entertaining at my house a\r\nman who came from Mexico in that ship, and who, being an eyewitness,\r\nhas told me of all the occurrence; but, since this account and other\r\nevents which occurred were reported to your Majesty two years ago,\r\nand I am sure that the report reached its destination, I shall not\r\ndetain you with a more detailed account of those matters.\r\n\r\nI have said all this in order to correct the wrong opinion held\r\nabout the rulers of China; and although it is true that they are\r\ncautious and suspicious, prudently seeking to protect their nation\r\nagainst the entrance of foreigners who might harm and disturb the\r\nland, still, without any question, what has been said against them\r\nis a false accusation; for until now we know of no person whom they\r\nhave killed for setting foot in their land, nor do we know of any\r\none whom they have thrown into prison for life, as the Portuguese\r\nreported. If any of the Spaniards who went to that land received\r\nill-treatment at the hands of the Chinese, it was due to the evil\r\nreports of us which the Portuguese spread among them, warning them\r\nto beware of Castilians as a people addicted to stealing and seizing\r\nforeign kingdoms; and who, as they had become masters of Nueva España,\r\nPeru, and the Philipinas, would strive likewise to obtain China. The\r\npeople of that kingdom, being the most cautious people in the world,\r\nbelieved quite readily what the Portuguese told them of us; and in\r\nconsequence they ill-treated the Castilians who went there. What I\r\nsay here is a well ascertained fact, known by people who have seen\r\nthemselves in great danger of being killed in China, just because the\r\nPortuguese had pointed them out to the Chinese as spies. One of the\r\nFranciscan religious whom I mentioned above has affirmed to me that\r\nhe himself had heard it said that the Portuguese had reported them\r\nas spies, and that for this reason they had been handcuffed. Were\r\nI not sure that this was so, I would not dare to affirm it to your\r\nMajesty, for these are serious matters which do not speak well for the\r\nPortuguese. Although it is not to be believed that all of them say\r\nthese things of us, still it needs only a few of them to speak such\r\nwords in order to persuade the Chinese; and those few have caused\r\nno little harm, for, had not God provided a remedy, they would have\r\ngreatly hindered the gospel from ever entering that kingdom. However,\r\nsince the Chinese have experienced the contrary of what had been told\r\nthem, and the Chinese or Sangleys (which mean the same thing) who go\r\nthere from here tell them of the fairness with which we treat them\r\nhere, and of the freedom that they enjoy among us, they have regained\r\nconfidence, and are not offended at seeing us there, as is proved by\r\nthose two ships which were driven on their shores. Doctor Sanctiago\r\nde Vera told me last year that he intended to make arrangements with\r\nthe mandarins of Chincheo by which they might give us an island not\r\nfar from that coast where the Castilians might settle and establish\r\ntheir commerce; he added that this plan met with no great opposition\r\non the part of the Sangleys. But this was not carried out, and I do\r\nnot know who was the cause of the failure. To corroborate the fact\r\nthat the mandarins do not keep the gates of that kingdom so tightly\r\nclosed as the Portuguese affirmed, something else has occurred quite\r\nrecently which shows it clearly. When the Portuguese expelled all the\r\nCastilian religious from Macan and ordered them to go to Yndia, and\r\nnot to return here, two friars fled secretly to the city of Canton,\r\nand thence they went to Chincheo by land, covering a distance of\r\nabout one hundred leagues, without receiving any harm whatever; on\r\nthe contrary, they were well treated, and the mardarin of Chincheo\r\nsent them back to this city in one of his own ships. The captain\r\nwho brought them has visited me several times, and I have thanked\r\nhim. At present these religious are in this city, and have spoken to\r\nme of what occurred to them on the journey from Macan to Chincheo,\r\nand of the presents which the captain who brought them here from\r\nChincheo gave them. From all the aforesaid we infer that what has been\r\nreported of the refusal of the Chinese kingdom, and of its rulers,\r\nto permit entrance to foreigners has been invention and slander by the\r\nPortuguese, who did this for their own private interests, fearing that\r\ntheir commerce with the Chinese would cease if the Castilians gained\r\nan entrance there. We who live here have attributed this slander to\r\nthat cause--or, more properly speaking, it has been the cunning of\r\nthe devil, who has tried in this way to hinder the results which we\r\nhope to obtain by introducing the gospel into that great kingdom,\r\nin such manner as Jesus Christ, our Lord, commanded his disciples\r\nand apostles to preach it throughout the whole world, not trusting in\r\ntheir own strength, or in human wisdom or power, but only in the power\r\nof God. For He, when it pleases Him, smoothes out all difficulties\r\nwhich may arise; and if at times He allows his ministers to suffer,\r\nit is for their best good, in order that the perfection and power of\r\nGod may shine forth with more brilliancy. Therefore, I say that if\r\nonce I thought it possible to make war on China because of the false\r\nreport given me of the hindrance and obstacles offered by the rulers\r\nof that kingdom to the preaching of the gospel, by not allowing those\r\nwho could preach it to enter the land, now that I know the truth,\r\nI declare that one of the worst offenses which could be committed\r\nagainst God, and the greatest possible obstacle and opposition to the\r\nspread of the gospel, would be to go to China with the mailed hand,\r\nor to use any sort of violence. For we have had at no time, nor do\r\nwe have, any cause, right, or reason to enter that kingdom by force\r\nof arms; for it is evident that we have not told them, nor do they\r\nknow, our intention. On the contrary they take us for people whose\r\nonly aim is to usurp foreign kingdoms; and, since they think thus,\r\nit is well for them to guard against us. In order to correct the\r\nwrong opinion which they entertain of us, we should not go there\r\nwith large fleets and armies equipped, because the only result would\r\nbe to vex and offend the greatest and best kingdom in the world;\r\nbut if we go there in the way that God commands and desires, and at\r\nthe time appointed by His Divine Majesty (for we men cannot know),\r\nwe shall make one of the largest conversions ever seen since the time\r\nof the primitive church. This is what the devil tries to hinder by\r\nspreading abroad the notion that the only way by which China can\r\nbe entered is by force of arms. The truth is, that until now no\r\npeople has been discovered so ready to receive the gospel as this,\r\nor of whom can be entertained such hope of great results by going\r\nto preach the gospel as our Lord Jesus Christ commanded; and if any\r\none, be he even an angel from heaven, were of a different opinion,\r\nmay your Majesty consider him an agent of the devil, who tries to\r\nconvince people that the gospel of Jesus Christ is to be preached\r\nwith zeal and not with knowledge, with violence and force of arms,\r\nlike the alcoran of Mahoma. This is a principle which may God remove\r\nfrom the minds of all Christian princes, and from all men who are well\r\nacquainted with the law of God and evangelical truth. I am confident\r\nthat, when your Majesty learns the truth, you will not allow anything\r\nto be done contrary to the will of God.\r\n\r\nNow I shall speak of the Sangleys, of whom there would be much to\r\nsay had I not in the past given to your Majesty an account of many\r\nthings concerning them. Therefore I shall be brief, in order not to\r\nmake this account longer than is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in this land, I found that in a village called\r\nTondo--which is not far from this city, there being a river\r\nbetween--lived many Sangleys; of whom some were Christians, but\r\nthe larger part infidels. In this city were also some shops kept\r\nby Sangleys, who lived here in order to sell the goods which they\r\nkept here from year to year. These Sangleys were scattered among\r\nthe Spaniards, with no specific place assigned to them, until Don\r\nGongalo Ronquillo allotted them a place to live in, and to be used\r\nas a silk-market (which is called here _Parián_), of four large\r\nbuildings. Here, many shops were opened, commerce increased, and more\r\nSangleys came to this city. Anxious for the conversion of this people,\r\nI soon cast my eyes upon them, and took precautions that they be well\r\ntreated, for in that way they would become attached to our religion--as\r\nI was aware that this was your Majesty's desire. Considering that,\r\nwherever Spaniards are to be found, there will always be some unruly\r\nones, who, forgetting the good example which they ought to give\r\nthese infidels, ill-treat them at times, I began on this account to\r\nprotect and to assist the Chinese, reproaching those who maltreated\r\nthem. I took care to have their grievances removed so as to give them\r\nfreedom to attend to their mercantile interests, and to sell their\r\ngoods. In this there has been very much abuse in this city by those\r\nwho were under obligation to furnish a remedy for it. For this reason\r\nthe Sangleys began to have much love for me, for they are the most\r\ngrateful people I have ever seen. Gradually commerce has so increased,\r\nand so many are the Sangley ships which come to this city laden with\r\ngoods--as all kinds of linen, and silks; ammunition; food supplies,\r\nas wheat, flour, sugar; and many kinds of fruit (although I have not\r\nseen the fruits common in Spaña)--and the city has been so embellished,\r\nthat were it not for the fires and the calamities visited upon her\r\nby land and by sea, she would be the most prosperous and rich city\r\nof your Majesty's domains. As I have written to your Majesty in\r\nother letters, this city has the best possible location for both\r\nits temporal and spiritual welfare, and for all its interests, that\r\ncould be desired. For on the east, although quite distant, yet not\r\nso far as to hinder a man from coming hither, with favorable voyage,\r\nlie Nueba España and Perú; to the north, about three hundred leagues,\r\nare the large islands of Japón; on the northwest lies the great and\r\nvast kingdom of China, which is so near this island that, starting\r\nearly in the morning with reasonable weather, one would sight China on\r\nthe next day; on the west lie Conchinchina, the kingdoms of Sián and\r\nPatany, Malaca, the great kingdom of Dacheu (the ancient Trapobana),\r\nand the two Xavas [Javas], the greater and the smaller; [35] and on\r\nthe south lie the islands of Maluco and Burney. From all these regions\r\npeople come to trade in this city; and from here we can go to them,\r\nfor they are near. As to spiritual advantages, if we had preachers\r\nof the gospel to send thither, these regions all stand open to us,\r\nand we could gain good results from it, because Franciscan religious\r\nhave gone to some of these places and have been well received, although\r\non account of many wars and the lack of interpreters they were forced\r\nto return. It is not so certain that they would be received in China\r\nas they are elsewhere; but up to this time no one of those who went\r\nthither has been killed or thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nWhen I came, all the Sangleys were almost forgotten, and relegated to\r\na corner. No thought was taken for their conversion, because no one\r\nknew their language or undertook to learn it on account of its great\r\ndifficulty; and because the religious who lived here were too busy with\r\nthe natives of these islands. Although the Augustinian religious had\r\ncharge of the Sangleys of Tondo, they did not minister to or instruct\r\nthem in their own language, but in that of the natives of this land;\r\nthus the Sangley Christians living here, were Christians only in name,\r\nknowing no more of Christianity than if they had never accepted it. I\r\nwas much grieved that a nation of such renown should lack priests to\r\nteach and instruct them in their own language. This led me to make\r\narrangements with Don Goncalo Ronquillo for a special location to be\r\nassigned to them for their own use, and priests were to be given them\r\nwho should learn their language and teach them in it. When this had\r\nbeen all arranged, and a priest had been appointed, the whole thing was\r\nundone through obstacles which arose at that time. Then I appealed to\r\nall religious orders to appoint some one of their religious to learn\r\nthe language and take charge of the Sangleys. Although all of them\r\nshowed a desire to do so, and some even began to learn it, yet no one\r\nsucceeded; and the Sangleys found themselves with no one to instruct\r\nthem and take up their conversion with the necessary earnestness,\r\nuntil, in the year eighty-seven, God brought to these islands the\r\nreligious of St. Dominic. Their coming was for the welfare of the\r\nSangleys, as the result proved, and as I shall relate further on. God\r\nsoon showed us that the religious had come by His will, to take charge\r\nof the Sangleys. This city, being built on a narrow site with the sea\r\non one side and a river on the other, was all occupied, and there\r\nseemed to be no place where the Dominicans could settle; but there\r\nwas soon discovered a site of which no one had thought until then,\r\nand which now is the best in the city. The site adjoins the Parian\r\nof the Sangleys, and that gave the religious of that order occasion\r\nto begin to hold intercourse with them, and for the religious and\r\nSangleys to become mutually attached to one another. For, whenever\r\nthe Sangleys come and go from the Parián, they pass by the church of\r\nSancto Domingo, and, being a very inquisitive people, they often stop\r\nand watch what is taking place there. When the confraternities of the\r\nRosary and of the Oaths, which are founded in that house, hold their\r\nprocessions, a great many Sangleys come out to watch them. They live\r\nso near the monastery that in the night they hear the religious sing\r\nmatins, and are not a little edified by it; for they also have their\r\nown form of religion, and there are among them religious men who lead\r\na very austere life and claim to live in profound meditation. When\r\nit shall please God to enlighten them, Christianity will undoubtedly\r\nprofit much by this characteristic.\r\n\r\nI said above that the monastery of Sancto Domingo stands close by\r\nthe Parián of the Sangleys, which is built in a marshy place on the\r\nborder of this city between its northern and southern sides. The\r\nSangleys were transferred thither by Diego Ronquillo, during his\r\ngovernorship, because the Parián which Don Gonzalo Ronquillo had built\r\nwas destroyed by fire. At first it seemed absurd to think that human\r\nhabitations were to be built in that marsh, but the Sangleys, who are\r\nvery industrious, and a most ingenious people, managed it so well\r\nthat, in a place seemingly uninhabitable, they have built a Parián\r\nresembling the other, although much larger and higher. According to\r\nthem it suits them better than the other, because on the firm ground\r\nwhere the four rows of buildings are located they have built their\r\nhouses and the streets leading through the Parián, a separate street\r\nfor each row of buildings.\r\n\r\nThere are long passages and the buildings are quadrangular\r\nin shape. This Parián was also destroyed by fire on account of\r\nthe houses being built of reeds; but through the diligence of the\r\npresident and governor, Doctor Vera, much better houses were built,\r\nand covered with tiles for protection against fire. This Parián has\r\nso adorned the city that I do not hesitate to affirm to your Majesty\r\nthat no other known city in España or in these regions possesses\r\nanything so well worth seeing as this; for in it can be found the\r\nwhole trade of China, with all kinds of goods and curious things\r\nwhich come from that country. These articles have already begun to be\r\nmanufactured here, as quickly and with better finish than in China;\r\nand this is due to the intercourse between Chinese and Spaniards,\r\nwhich has enabled the former to perfect themselves in things which\r\nthey were not wont to produce in China. In this Parián are to be found\r\nworkmen of all trades and handicrafts of a nation, and many of them\r\nin each occupation. They make much prettier articles than are made in\r\nEspaña, and sometimes so cheap that I am ashamed to mention it. If we\r\nCastilians were as cautious as the Portuguese in trading with them,\r\nthese articles would be much cheaper, and the Chinese would still\r\ngain by it. For goods are sold at a very low cost in China; and,\r\nno matter how little profit they make there, when these objects are\r\nsold here they yield large profits. But no restraint can be put upon\r\nthe Castilians, nor can they be regulated--the consequence of which\r\nis that everything is going to ruin; for the Sangleys, who were not\r\nborn as fools, begin to understand the Spaniards' disposition, and\r\nto take advantage of their lack of prudence, thus becoming richer\r\nthan they would did the latter observe moderation.\r\n\r\nThis Parián is provided with doctors and apothecaries, who post in\r\ntheir shops placards printed in their own language announcing what\r\nthey have to sell. There are also many eating-houses where the Sangleys\r\nand the natives take their meals; and I have been told that these are\r\nfrequented even by Spaniards. The handicrafts pursued by Spaniards\r\nhave all died out, because people buy their clothes and shoes from\r\nthe Sangleys, who are very good craftsmen in Spanish fashion, and make\r\neverything at a very low cost. Although the silversmiths do not know\r\nhow to enamel (for enamel is not used in China), in other respects\r\nthey produce marvelous work in gold and silver. They are so skilful\r\nand clever that, as soon as they see any object made by a Spanish\r\nworkman, they reproduce it with exactness. What arouses my wonder\r\nmost is, that when I arrived no Sangley knew how to paint anything;\r\nbut now they have so perfected themselves in this art that they have\r\nproduced marvelous work with both the brush and the chisel, and I\r\nthink that nothing more perfect could be produced than some of their\r\nmarble statues of the Child Jesus which I have seen. This opinion is\r\naffirmed by all who have seen them. The churches are beginning to\r\nbe furnished with the images which the Sangleys make, and which we\r\ngreatly lacked before; and considering the ability displayed by these\r\npeople in reproducing the images which come from España, I believe\r\nthat soon we shall not even miss those made in Flandes. What I say of\r\nthe painters applies also to embroiderers, who are already producing\r\nexcellent embroidered works, and are continually improving in that art.\r\n\r\nWhat has pleased all of us here has been the arrival of a book-binder\r\nfrom Mexico. He brought books with him, set up a bindery, and hired a\r\nSangley who had offered his services to him. The Sangley secretly, and\r\nwithout his master noticing it, watched how the latter bound books,\r\nand lo, in less than [_blank space in Retana_] he left the house,\r\nsaying that he wished to serve him no longer, and set up a similar\r\nshop. I assure your Majesty that he became so excellent a workman\r\nthat his master has been forced to give up the business, because the\r\nSangley has drawn all the trade. His work is so good that there is\r\nno need of the Spanish tradesman. At the time I am writing, I have in\r\nmy hand a Latin version of Nabarro bound by him; and, in my judgment,\r\nit could not be better bound, even in Sevilla.\r\n\r\nThere are many gardeners among the Sangleys, who, in places which\r\nseemed totally unproductive, are raising many good vegetables of the\r\nkinds that grow in España and in Mexico. They keep the market here\r\nas well supplied as that of Madrid or Salamanca. They make chairs,\r\nbridles, and stirrups of so good a quality and so cheaply that some\r\nmerchants wish to load a cargo of these articles for Mexico.\r\n\r\nMany bakers make bread with the wheat and fine flour which they bring\r\nfrom China, and sell it in the market-place and along the streets. This\r\nhas much benefited the city, for they make good bread and sell it at\r\nlow cost; and although this land possesses much rice, many now use\r\nbread who did not do so before. They are so accommodating that when\r\none has no money to pay for the bread, they give him credit and mark\r\nit on a tally. It happens that many soldiers get food this way all\r\nthrough the year, and the bakers never fail to provide them with all\r\nthe bread they need. This has been a great help for the poor of this\r\ncity, for had they not found this refuge they would suffer want. The\r\nSangleys sell meat of animals raised in this country, as swine,\r\ndeer, and carabaos (a kind of Italian buffalo, whose flesh is equal\r\nto beef). They also sell many fowls and eggs; and if they did not\r\nsell them we all would suffer want. They are so intent upon making\r\na livelihood that even split wood is sold in the Parián. The city\r\nfinds most of its sustenance in the fish which these Sangleys sell;\r\nthey catch so much of it every day that the surplus is left in the\r\nstreets, and they sell it at so low a cost that for one real one can\r\nbuy a sufficient quantity of fish to supply dinner and supper for\r\none of the leading houses in the city.\r\n\r\nIn the remaining space within the four fronts of the Parián is a\r\nlarge pond, which receives water from the sea through an estuary. In\r\nthe middle of the pond is an islet, where the Sangleys who commit\r\ncrimes receive their punishment, so as to be seen by all. The pond\r\nbeautifies the Parián and proves to be of great advantage, because\r\nmany ships sail into it through the aforesaid estuary at high tide,\r\nand bring to the Parián all the supplies, which are distributed thence\r\nall over the city.\r\n\r\nAmong the benefits which this city receives from the intercourse\r\nwith the Sangleys, by no means the least important is that, while in\r\nEspaña stone-masonry is so expensive and difficult to produce, here,\r\nthrough the diligence and industry of the Sangleys, we are able to\r\nbuild fine houses of hewn stone at a low cost; and in so short a\r\ntime that in one year a man has been able to complete a house, all\r\nready for habitation. It is wonderful to see with what rapidity many\r\nsumptuous houses, churches, monasteries, hospitals, and a fort are\r\nbeing built. The Sangleys also made very good bricks and roof-tiles\r\nat low cost. At first, lime was made with stone as in España; but now\r\nthe Sangleys are using a kind of pebble, called \"white corals,\" which\r\nthey find on this coast; and also shells of large oysters, of which\r\nthere is a large quantity. At the beginning this lime did not seem to\r\nbe of good quality; but the kind produced ever since has been so good\r\nthat no other kind of lime is being employed in this city. It came to\r\nbe sold at so low a price that for my house as well as for others we\r\nbought a cahiz [36] of lime for four reals, and one thousand bricks\r\nfor eight--although this is not the fixed price, for it fluctuates\r\naccording to the money which comes from Mexico. The Sangleys know how\r\nto take advantage of the right time; they sell their goods dearer when\r\nthey know that there is money to buy them, but they never raise the\r\nprice so as to make it unreasonable. They agree to bring all the lime,\r\nbricks, and tiles to the house of the purchaser, thus saving him a\r\ngreat deal of labor. It is of great advantage also to have the Sangleys\r\nconstruct the building; they agree on so much per braza, including the\r\ncutting of stones and the carrying of the sand. If they are given the\r\nlime, they will furnish all the rest, and will thus deliver the house\r\nor work without any trouble to the owner. The day's wage of a Sangley,\r\nwhen he does not work by the job, is one real, and he provides his own\r\nfood. The Sangleys are hard workers and very greedy for money. The\r\nnumber of those who have come to this city is so large that another\r\nlarge Parián is being built by the side of the above-mentioned one,\r\nresembling it in shape. Many Sangleys have built their houses in it,\r\nand it would be filled with people by this time had not the bricks of\r\nMexico failed us last year through the Marquis de Villa-Manrrique--who,\r\naccording to report, prevented the shipment of the bricks to us, thus\r\ncausing no little injury and loss to this city and to the Sangleys. He\r\nshall give an account to your Majesty, and a more exact one to God,\r\nof the injuries and loss that he has caused to this land. Had not your\r\nMajesty set matters right by sending a successor to him, [37] and so\r\ngood a one as you did send, he would have brought ruin upon this land;\r\nand, even so, he leaves it sufficiently harassed and afflicted.\r\n\r\nThe Sangleys who live in this Parián number ordinarily between three\r\nand four thousand, not counting the two thousand and more who come\r\nand go in ships. These, together with those residing in Tondo, and\r\nthe fishermen and gardeners who live in this neighborhood, number,\r\naccording to the Dominican fathers who have them in charge, from six\r\nto seven thousand souls. Four religious of that order are engaged in\r\ntheir conversion and instruction.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned many small matters here, and it does not seem very\r\nconsiderate to write so long a letter to one who is so occupied in\r\naffairs of moment as your Majesty is; but my great zeal deserves\r\nforgiveness. For, considering how far distant these regions are, and\r\nhow extraordinary are these people--of whom we have known so little\r\nhitherto, on account of the opposition shown by the Portuguese to our\r\ngaining any knowledge of them--it seemed right for me to send your\r\nMajesty a relation and more specific news concerning the matter, so\r\nthat your Majesty may know what exists and occurs here in his realms,\r\nand may enjoy through experience what was denied to his predecessors\r\nto hear even through report. Had I not already given your Majesty\r\nnews of many other things which occur here, I would not dare to omit\r\nthem now, even if I might be considered prolix.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition and disposition of the Sangleys in temporal\r\nmatters, when the Dominican religious came to these islands in May,\r\neighty-seven. I have already sent to your Majesty an account of what\r\ntook place from the time of their arrival until the following year. I\r\nreported the singular change which had taken place among the Sangleys\r\nafter the Dominican religious took charge of them, and the results\r\nwhich began to be obtained among them; and that they willingly began\r\nto accept Christianity, in which they have persevered until now. I\r\nwill not here reiterate that, although there are many things worthy of\r\nbeing known, and for which many thanks are due to God, who shows how\r\nwonderful is His power when it pleases Him. What is left for me to\r\nrelate, is the departure of the Dominican religious for China; and,\r\nalthough we do not know how it has fared with them, as they set out\r\nso recently, still the beginnings give us reason to hope that with\r\nthe help of our Lord, they will be very successful.\r\n\r\nOf the Dominican religious who came to these islands, four are\r\nengaged in ministering to the Sangleys. Two of these four officiate\r\nin the church of Sant Gabriel, which, together with the house where\r\nthe religious live, stands close to the Parián. Another church with\r\nits house is on the promontory of Bay-bay, near Tondo--which a river\r\ndivides, separating it from Manila. Two of the four have learned\r\nthe language of the Sangleys so well, and one of these two how\r\nto write also (which is the most difficult part of the language),\r\nthat the Sangleys wonder at their knowledge. The opportunity which\r\nthe infidels of both towns had to hear the sermons preached by the\r\nfathers to the Christians, made them acquainted with many matters\r\nrelating to our faith, and some of them desired to be baptized. But\r\nwhen they saw that, by becoming Christians, they would not be allowed\r\nto return to their own country, on account of the danger which the\r\nfaith encounters in a country where the people are all idolaters,\r\nthey said that our religion was too severe, since in embracing it one\r\nhas to forsake his native country, and to deprive himself of father,\r\nmother, wife, children, and relatives. The arguments that they set\r\nforth were such that it seemed as if they wished to persuade us to\r\nbaptize them without cutting off their hair, and without forbidding\r\nthem to return to their own country. We saw that it was not advisable\r\nto do as they desired, and left matters as they stood. The Sangleys\r\nthemselves told us to send fathers to their country to preach to them,\r\nsaying that there they would become converted without so much risk as\r\nhere. After due consideration of the matter, the Dominican fathers\r\nand myself decided that it was necessary to go to China; for, if\r\nGod permitted the religious to remain in that land, we could baptize\r\nthe Sangleys here without cutting off their hair, or preventing them\r\nfrom returning to their country to rejoice in their children, wives,\r\nand property. The Sangleys were much pleased at this decision; but\r\nthere were differences of opinion regarding the manner in which the\r\nreligious should go. The president thought that it would be best for\r\nthem to go in a fragata accompanied by Spaniards: but the Chinese said\r\nthat the friars should go alone, and not in the company of Spaniards;\r\nthus many arguments were presented on both sides. Two or three times\r\nI saw our endeavors thwarted, because the devil was laboring with\r\nall his might to prevent them. A fragata had already been bought,\r\nthe captain and the men who were to take the friars over had been\r\nchosen, and almost everything was ready for their setting sail, when\r\nthe plan was defeated I know not whence or how. My disappointment and\r\nthe great sadness which I felt in seeing the defeat of an expedition\r\nwhich I so much desired, and for whose fulfilment had not sufficed his\r\nHoliness's permission and the special ordinance from your Majesty,\r\nmade me think that this was the will of God; thus I was forced to\r\nabandon the attempt. But God, whose plans do not depend upon the\r\nadvice of men, arranged matters better than I could have hoped, for\r\nHe moved the hearts of the Sangley Christians, Don Francisco Zanco, a\r\nChristian and the governor of the Sangleys, and Don Tomás Syguán. The\r\nlatter I baptized about two years ago, without cutting his hair,\r\nfor I thought that God was to accomplish some great work through him,\r\nas well as through the other--who, being one of the oldest Christians\r\nin this island, also wore his hair long. When these two saw that the\r\nSpaniards were not going to China, and that the friars remained here\r\nbecause there was no one to take them over, they went to Fray Juan\r\nCobo, one of the two friars acquainted thoroughly with the language,\r\nand who has charge of, the Sangleys of the Parián, and manifested to\r\nhim their grief at seeing how little they were trusted. They said that\r\nsince the fathers remained here because no Spaniards went to China,\r\nthey who were Christians and natives of that land would take them over\r\nin more safety; they added that there should be no hesitation to accept\r\ntheir company, for they would lose their own lives before any harm\r\nshould befall the religious. This we understood as an inspiration of\r\nthe Holy Spirit, because until then we had never heard that a Sangley\r\nwould dare to take any Spaniards to China; accordingly, we decided\r\nto send the friars with the Chinese. When this was announced in the\r\nParián, all the friendly Sangleys, of whom there are many among the\r\ninfidels, were much pleased. One of the Sangley Christians had not\r\ntaken a mouthful of food for two days, through grief at seeing us\r\nabandon the expedition; but when he heard that it was going to be\r\nmade, and how it was going to be carried out, his joy knew no bounds,\r\nand he declared that it was just as he had hoped, and that it was\r\nthe necessary method to pursue. I called two Sangley infidels--who,\r\nalthough without the faith, are endowed with all the qualities of\r\ngood men, and who, I hope, through God's blessing will soon become\r\nChristians--and asked them what was their opinion concerning the\r\nexpedition. They answered that they were very glad to see the way in\r\nwhich the religious were going; for, if they went with Spaniards,\r\nall would be lost. Thus we decided upon the departure, sending at\r\npresent no more than two religious: Fray Miguel de Benavides, [38]\r\nwho was the first to learn the language of the Sangleys; and Father\r\nJuan de Castro, who came as vicar of the religious, and who was made\r\nprovincial here. We preferred these two, as one is well acquainted\r\nwith the language, and the other is much loved and esteemed by the\r\nSangleys on account of his venerable gray locks and blessed old\r\nage; and we know that in that land old people are much respected\r\nand revered. As our Lord sent His disciples, so went these fathers,\r\nstripped of all human support, and carrying nothing with them except\r\ntheir own persons, their breviaries, and Bibles, for in this manner,\r\nand not with encompassing soldiers, should the gospel be preached.\r\n\r\nI give many thanks to God that this expedition, so much desired by\r\nme, started under the best auspices which could be desired; for it is\r\nbeing undertaken by special permission of the Pope and by a decree of\r\nyour Majesty, and with the consent of the governor, of myself, and\r\nof the auditors of this Audiencia. This enterprise has caused great\r\nhappiness to all the religious orders, and to all the inhabitants of\r\nthis city; and many demonstrations of rejoicing on the part of all the\r\nSangleys. May it please the divine Majesty that the end be as we all\r\ndesire. Another event occurred at the time of the expedition, which\r\ngave us a great deal of pleasure, and kindled in us the hope that\r\nGod was really about to open the gates of that great kingdom. The\r\naforesaid captain who brought the two Franciscan friars to this\r\ncity received a letter, which they call _chapa_, for the president,\r\nin which the latter is entreated to do justice to the captain who\r\nbrought the letter, so that he might collect some money which was due\r\nhim in this city; in the letter, he anxiously entreats the two great\r\nfathers Juan and Miguel, who know the language, to help the captain,\r\nfor they are known in that country to favor the Sangleys. Their names\r\noccur twice in that chapa, the first letters of the two names being\r\nwritten in red ink, which is considered a mark of veneration among\r\nthe Chinese. A Sangley woman who lives in Chincheo wrote a letter to\r\nFray Juan Cobo, thanking him for having helped her husband in a matter\r\nof business. These were the first indications by which we knew that\r\nthis expedition was starting under the guidance of God. So on Tuesday,\r\nthe twenty-second of May, of this year ninety, I went to the church of\r\nthe Parián, and said mass there; after which the two Sangleys who had\r\noffered their services went through a ceremony worthy of notice. They\r\nknelt down before the altar where I said mass, and remained there\r\nfor the space of two _credos_, speaking to one another in their own\r\nlanguage and holding each other's hands; after that they embraced one\r\nanother, and I learned afterwards that they had sworn to each other\r\nfriendship and fidelity. From that place the fathers went to embark,\r\nand I went with them, accompanied by many Sangleys. On account of a\r\ncontrary wind, the ship in which they were going could not set sail;\r\nand there were sent, to tow it out, four champans, which are the\r\nsmall boats of the Sangley ships. They gladly pulled it out to sea,\r\nfor more than a league, where we left them under God's protection,\r\nand returned to the city. The captains of two Sangley ships who are\r\nabout to follow in the same course have asked me for letters for the\r\nreligious, promising me to place them in their own hands, and I shall\r\nnot fail to write to them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I must announce to your Majesty that a hospital has been\r\nbuilt by the Dominican friars who have charge of the Sangleys of the\r\nParián, which is close by their house. The hospital takes care of sick\r\nSangleys and subsists on no other income than what the fathers gather\r\nas charity, and what the Sangley infidels contribute towards it. This\r\nfact has been so rumored in China, that the whole country feels very\r\nkindly towards the fathers, knowing of the friendly reception given\r\nto their countrymen here. About a year ago a prominent Sangley was\r\nconverted. He was a doctor and an herbalist; but, forsaking all other\r\nworldly interests, he has offered and devoted himself to the service\r\nof the hospital. He cures the sick, bestowing upon them much love and\r\ncharity, and prescribing for them his purges and medicines. In short,\r\nit was God who led him thither for the welfare of that hospital, and,\r\nto make the fame thereof more widely spread throughout China. Therefore\r\nI humbly beg your Majesty to be pleased to order that this hospital be\r\nendowed, so that the sick may be cared for. Moreover, if your Majesty\r\nattend to this personally, that fact will be very well received in\r\nChina and will be of more benefit than the presents which your Majesty\r\nordered to be sent to the king.\r\n\r\nDoctor Vera, who is now president, on seeing the good will with which\r\nthose two Sangley Christians, Don Francisco Canco and Don Tomás Siguán,\r\noffered their services for taking the fathers to China, exempted them,\r\nin the name of your Majesty, from paying taxes for the use of a ship\r\nfor six years. I entreat your Majesty to be pleased to confirm this\r\ngrant, and to extend it for life; for they certainly performed a great\r\ndeed, and one considered of much importance by all the inhabitants\r\nof this city, both Spaniards and Sangleys. They deserve this favor\r\nfrom your Majesty, even if we should not gain the desired result,\r\nbecause they for their part have offered what they could.\r\n\r\nFray Juan Cobo, the Dominican religious--who, as I have said before,\r\nknows the language of the Sangleys and their writing, and who is\r\nmost esteemed by them--is sending to your Majesty a book, one of a\r\nnumber brought to him from China. This intercourse which is taking\r\nroot between them and ourselves is not a bad beginning for the object\r\nwe have in view. The book is in Chinese writing on one half of the\r\nleaf, and Castilian on the other, the two corresponding to each\r\nother. It is a work worthy of your Majesty, and may it be received\r\nas such, not because of its worth, but because it is so rare a work,\r\nnever seen before in the Parián, or outside of China. According to\r\nmy judgment, it contains things worthy of consideration, by which\r\nis seen the force of the human reason; since without the light\r\nof the faith those things approach so near to those taught us by\r\nthe Christian religion. From this your Majesty will see how much in\r\nerror is the person who pretends that in kingdoms like that of China,\r\nwhere such things are taught, we should enter by force of arms to\r\npreach to them our faith. It is clear that with a people like this,\r\nthe force of reason has more power than that of arms. May our Lord\r\ndirect this affair according to His will; and may He be pleased that\r\nwithin the days of your Majesty we may see these kingdoms converted\r\nto the faith, and that your Majesty may enjoy this reputation first\r\non earth and then in heaven. Amen. Manila, June 24, 1590.\r\n\r\n_Fray Domingo_, Bishop of the Philipinas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Letters from Domingo de Salazar to Felipe II\r\n\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nFive decrees of your Majesty came to me this year of ninety in the\r\nship \"Santiago,\" which arrived at this port on the last of May. They\r\nare all dated at Madrid, four on the twenty-third of June of the\r\nyear eighty-seven, and the fifth on the eighteenth of February of\r\neighty-eight. After perusing the contents of the said decrees, I can\r\ntruly not restrain my surprise that there can be men in the world who\r\ndare to say and declare things which are not certainly proved to be\r\nthe truth, much less to give such information to their king. To report\r\nto one's sovereign the contrary of what happens, or to affirm what\r\none is not certain is the truth, is a most grave offense, worthy of\r\nall punishment and chastisement. Such persons may properly be called\r\ndestroyers of their countries, because, in not giving information\r\nin accordance with the principles of truth, they fail to remedy the\r\nevils and provide the good which is necessary for the preservation\r\nof the land. As this commonwealth is so far away from your Majesty,\r\nit has to be governed, not by what your Majesty sees and knows,\r\nbut by the information received by him regarding it. This must be\r\naccording to the good or bad intention of the informer. Consequently,\r\nthis commonwealth is subjected to many hardships and misfortunes, by\r\nthe fault not of your Majesty--with whose most holy zeal and desire\r\nfor the welfare of this land we are well acquainted--but of us here\r\nwho send information. There are but few of us who, oblivious of our own\r\ninterests and pretensions, now fix our eyes on the common good alone,\r\nand seek only this; but the most of us seek only our own interests,\r\nour informations and reports are shaped by these, as appears by the\r\nincrease of the tributes which your Majesty commands to be made. As\r\nthis is discussed, however, in another letter, I will go to no greater\r\nlength than to say that, if your Majesty were present here, no orders\r\nwould be given to increase the tributes of these miserable people,\r\nbut rather they would pay less. But he who informed your Majesty\r\nthat more tribute can be paid has already accounted or will account\r\nto God also. I am affected in part by these hardships and dangers,\r\nas it is now two years since your Majesty wrote me a reprimand, as\r\nif I were the man to blame for the dissensions of the Audiencia. God\r\nknows, as do all in this community, that if I had not made peace,\r\nthe dissensions between the president and auditors would have lasted\r\nuntil today. The same I say of the five decrees which I received\r\nthis year. Among them are several which show that he who informed\r\nyour Majesty did so in an account entirely malicious and totally\r\ncontrary to the truth. Others show that, although the informer told\r\nsomething of the truth, he did so in an entirely different manner from\r\nthe way in which things happened, concealing what he ought to say,\r\nand affirming what he should not. This will appear by my reply to\r\neach decree--not as an excuse for myself, as I consider myself to be\r\nvery rightly judged elsewhere; but in order to satisfy your Majesty,\r\nas I shall proceed to relate.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the first decree, which treats of the confessions of the\r\nconquerors, they being constrained to make restitution _in solidum_,\r\nI say that I have never done anything in this bishopric which leaves\r\nme so vexed and conscience-stricken, as that I dealt so mildly with\r\nthose who came to this country nominally as conquerors, but actually\r\nas destroyers. According to the true and sound doctrine of St. Thomas,\r\nand of all right-feeling men, they are all bound to pay _in solidum_\r\nfor the damage which they have done. I, with more than necessary\r\nboldness, have planned so that no one has been asked to pay more\r\nthan he himself has confessed that he owed; but that is nothing in\r\ncomparison with the innumerable injuries which have been committed in\r\nthis country. Four years have passed since I gave this order obliging\r\nthem to pay one hundred pesos, and then another two hundred pesos,\r\nthe largest amount not exceeding five hundred pesos. There were\r\nvery few persons taxed for the larger sum, and they were captains or\r\nleaders of expeditions. They have put me off from one year to another\r\nand even yet they have not paid me, always alleging poverty. I have\r\nfound it necessary to take from the little that I have to pay some\r\nof these obligations, on account of the needs of the Indians, and\r\nbecause the Spaniards had not the wherewithal to pay them. When I\r\nconsidered the hardships suffered by Spaniards in this land, and that\r\nit will utterly ruin them, if the matter with which we have to deal be\r\ntreated severely by the theologians, I dared, on this account, to do\r\nwhat no one else would have done. There is no lack of religious who,\r\nsince their arrival here, condemn my action, and say that I am obliged\r\nto constrain the conquerors still further, or to pay the compensation\r\nmyself. I assure your Majesty that these scruples have constrained me,\r\nand do so today, to such an extent that this is the principal thing\r\namong other matters of considerable import of which I have to give\r\nan account to his Holiness and to your Majesty. There is no doubt\r\nwhatever that he who does the damage is obliged to make restitution;\r\nand all the more when the injured persons are living as they, or their\r\nchildren and heirs, do in these islands. From investigations which\r\nI have had made regarding those persons who inflicted the injuries,\r\nI am assured that the sums collected as restitution do not amount to\r\nthe hundredth part of the valuation of the damages. As my age makes it\r\nimpossible for me to go to Spain, and since your Majesty, as a most\r\nChristian prince, so earnestly desires and strives for the welfare\r\nof these natives, I shall send herewith a memorandum of what I have\r\ndone in this case, and of what each of the conquerors has paid, and\r\nof the injuries committed--although it would be impossible to relate\r\nthem all. I do this so that your Majesty may be pleased to grant to me\r\nand to all this land mercy and grace, when my actions are considered\r\nthere; and, if it should be necessary, to procure the approbation\r\nof his Holiness to compromise the matter by releasing them from the\r\nremainder of the restitutions, as full restitution is impossible. To\r\nattempt to do more would be only to harass them, with no other result\r\nthan burdening their consciences. Thus I will be freed from these\r\nintolerable scruples and continuous vexations in which I am placed.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty seems to hold me guilty for having encouraged the slaves\r\nto leave the Spaniards. I do not know how blame can be placed on me\r\ntherefor, since the Indians held as slaves by the Spaniards (who were\r\nunwilling to let them go) have been declared free by your Majesty. It\r\nwas evident that the former could not be absolved, any more than\r\nif they had stolen property; and your Majesty knows that, in the\r\njurisdiction of the conscience, there is not the liberty that there\r\nis in external matters. Your Majesty may pardon a life, or remit the\r\npenalty of the law to him whom he may consider meet; but the tribunal\r\nof conscience is not free to pardon anyone, or to absolve persons from\r\nany sin, except when they act as they ought. Confession being thus\r\nrigorous, even greater laxity was permitted than should have been. Your\r\nMajesty must believe that I am trying to do everything possible here,\r\nso as not to exceed my duty, and I never take such action without first\r\nconsulting with such persons of learning and conscience as are here.\r\n\r\nIn the second decree, your Majesty orders that when the Sangleys\r\nwish to be baptized, their hair shall not be cut off. He who reported\r\nthis to your Majesty deceived you, for there are not only a hundred\r\nhouses occupied by Sangleys who remain here for negotiations with\r\ntheir merchandise, but more than [_blank space in MS_.] who live in\r\nthe alcaiceria of this city, called Parián, and more than [_blank\r\nspace in MS_.] [39] in all the neighborhood. It is certain that\r\nin both places there are at the very least more than [_blank space\r\nin MS_.]. Since the religious of St. Dominic came to this country,\r\nmore than two hundred have been baptized, and every day many more are\r\nreceiving baptism. But inasmuch as what concerns the Sangleys, and the\r\ngreat compassion with which God has dealt with them and with us, will\r\ngo in a separate letter, in order not to increase the length of this,\r\nyour Majesty will read therein matters that will prove how well you\r\nare served, and you will give abundant thanks to God. He who reported\r\nthis to your Majesty must have some zeal, but not with knowledge; for\r\nI consider all the conditions, desire the conversion of these Chinese,\r\nand obtain it, better than he who wrote to your Majesty. I would not\r\ndecide to have their hair cut off, if it were not so necessary that\r\nnot to do so would be to endanger greatly the faith and the persons\r\nwith whom I deal. These affairs are of such a nature that no matter\r\nwhat opinion were given, I could not do anything else, even though I\r\nshould wish to do so. Because I considered it fitting to baptize two\r\nof them without cutting off their hair, I thereby did myself much\r\nharm; your Majesty may thus see how contrary to actual facts are\r\nthe things written you from here, and that the death-penalty is not\r\nsuffered for cutting off their hair, as was written to your Majesty;\r\nfor after the Dominican fathers learned the language we discovered\r\nvast secrets of that land, which were formerly well hidden.\r\n\r\nThe third decree states that there are many ecclesiastics in this\r\nbishopric who trade and carry on traffic, to the great scandal of\r\nand bad example to both Spaniards and Indians. He who wrote your\r\nMajesty told the truth in part, since two ecclesiastics from Nueva\r\nEspaña furnished this bad example, although I did what I could to\r\nprevent them. Nevertheless, God punished them more severely than I\r\ndid; for all the property of one was taken away by the Englishman,\r\n[40] and the other died here, and lost what he had sent to Nueva\r\nEspaña. Those ecclesiastics who are under my government, however,\r\nhave not exceeded their duty in this respect as much as your Majesty\r\nhas been informed. Moreover, they are not so many as has been said\r\nin Spain, for there are not more than five who are stationed among\r\nthe Indians, and these are so poor that they do not even have enough\r\nto eat. More than one and one-half years before this decree came, I\r\nhad taken measures to correct the excess which might result, having\r\nordered that no ecclesiastic should carry on traffic. This appears\r\nby the ordinances which I had made concerning this. That your Majesty\r\nmay order them to be considered and amended, I enclose them with this\r\nletter. In the future this order will be more rigorously observed,\r\naccording to your Majesty's command.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth decree, your Majesty says that the president of this\r\nAudiencia wrote that when he came to this land, he agreed with me\r\nas to the order [of precedence] to be followed when the Audiencia\r\nand I should encounter each other in public. He further says that,\r\ndisregarding this arrangement, I sat in the place which did not belong\r\nto me, and turned my back on the Audiencia. I would be very glad to\r\nmeet the president before your Majesty, and hear his reason for daring\r\nto inform your Majesty in such a manner. It is very certain that no\r\nsuch agreement was ever made between him and me, except that, when\r\nthere was to be a procession in the church, the president should go\r\nwith the auditors, and I with my clergy; for he claimed the right hand,\r\nand I did not have it to take. Thus we came to this agreement. The\r\nplace, however, was not discussed, nor was there any excuse for doing\r\nso, as it is well known that the Audiencia is always seated on the\r\ngospel side in the body of the chapel; and, although the bishop is\r\nusually in the choir, he may, when he wishes to do so, sit on the\r\ngospel side, above the steps. Wherever I have been, this has been\r\nthe practice; and I sent an account thereof, with the testimony of\r\nan eye-witness, to the Council of the Indias. Your Majesty provides\r\nand commands by this decree that I shall take the place belonging to\r\nme. This order means that I take the same place which I took then,\r\nas that is the proper place belonging to a bishop, without giving\r\nany cause whatever for the Audiencia to feel injured, as the places\r\nare very distinct from each other. Although the vexation ceased,\r\nbecause of the suppression of the Audiencia, the injury done me by\r\nthe president, in writing to your Majesty, has not yet come to an\r\nend. I ought not to fail to reply to what is so unjustly imputed to me.\r\n\r\nHe who informed your Majesty of the matter contained in the fifth\r\ndecree, namely, that when appeal is made to the royal Audiencia in\r\ncases of fuerça, [41] I do not allow the notaries to give an account\r\nthereof; and that I seize the writs and records of proceedings, so that\r\nthey cannot be issued, the Audiencia having requested me in vain to do\r\notherwise--whoever, I say, gave this account to your Majesty did me\r\ngreater injury than any of the others. For not only is this not so,\r\nbut I even urge the notary to give a report; and I am so far from\r\n[what has been said] to the contrary, that I assure your Majesty\r\nthat I much regretted the suppression of the Audiencia. For I was\r\nvery glad that, whenever I denied anything on appeal, the Audiencia\r\nexamined my reasons therefor; and, whatever was determined there,\r\nmy conscience was freed and at rest. Moreover, I always accepted,\r\nwithout making any objection, the decisions of the Audiencia; for\r\nI would consider it a grievous offense to deny your Majesty's right\r\nto make the final decision in cases of fuerça, and would not presume\r\nto contradict it in any manner whatsoever. If he who made that report\r\nbased it on two cases which came up--one when they erased my name from\r\nthe prayer at the mass of the Audiencia, and substituted their own\r\nnames; the other when, in an investigation, they claimed the right to\r\nexamine the proceedings which had been conducted in secret--in these\r\ntwo cases I confess that I refused to give up the records. I did so in\r\none instance because there were therein very secret matters touching\r\nthe office of the Inquisition, of which I was then in charge. When\r\nthey commanded that report of this case be given, I said that it\r\nwould be furnished in so far as concerned the chaplain of the said\r\nAudiencia. This was what they had asked, and claimed the right to\r\ntry this case. Nevertheless, they would accept nothing but the entire\r\nproceedings; but with this I could not comply, for it would have been\r\nimpossible to do so without very grave damage to my office. After\r\nconsidering my reasons therefor, the Audiencia insisted no more in\r\nthe case. The other case concerned the general investigation which I\r\nhad made of the prebendaries and clergy--two of whom appealed against\r\nthe sentence which I imposed, stipulating that the tenor thereof\r\nbe observed as is expressly commanded by the Council of Trent. They\r\nhad recourse to the Audiencia; and when an order was given for the\r\nrecord of the case to be presented, I replied that there were secret\r\nmatters touching the honor of the clergy, which I could not show,\r\nbut that I would show that part referring to the two ecclesiastics;\r\nas they wished their offenses to be known. Nevertheless, it was not\r\nright to exhibit the guilt of the others, as they did not feel that\r\ntheir sentences were unjust. There were many arguments over this point,\r\nand all the theologians of this land said that I was right. To avoid\r\nscandal I openly consented that the two ecclesiastics should appeal\r\nto the archbishop. [42] Both then and now I have felt much aggrieved\r\nby the injustice done me by the Audiencia. I have sent a complaint\r\nthereof to your Majesty, and do not know why the testimony I sent has\r\nnot yet arrived there. I had then and still have reason for complaining\r\nthat the Audiencia usurped my jurisdiction and discussed proceedings\r\nwhich properly belong to me, but in which they have forestalled me. A\r\ncitizen of this city left a piece of land whereon was built a hospital\r\nand church for the poor. Although this was ecclesiastical property,\r\nthey deprived me of judgment in this case, and retained it in their own\r\nbody. At another time, the Indians had dared to take a friar from his\r\nconvent, and they dragged him to the place where I was. I commenced to\r\ntry the case, and gave a verdict against the Indians, as it was doubly\r\nsacrilegious to take the friar from his convent, and to place hands\r\non an ecclesiastic. This case came to the Audiencia by way of appeal,\r\nand it still remains there, with the records. A beneficed priest,\r\nwho was performing the duties of his office, was refused its dues\r\nby the encomendero, and came to me for justice. After I had ordered\r\nthe encomendero to make the payment, he appealed to the Audiencia,\r\nand they retained the suit there, claiming that the property given to\r\nbeneficiaries in this land is secular. As I am poor, and have little\r\npower, these injuries and similar ones have not been heard of in\r\nSpain. I have suffered them and have kept silence, in order to avoid\r\nscandal; but for having resisted in but two cases, in which I was\r\nobliged to defend the right of my jurisdiction, in order to comply\r\nwith the duties of my office, they made a damaging report of me to\r\nyour Majesty. They say that I would not permit a report to be made,\r\nand took the records of the suit from the notary, so that they could\r\nnot be dealt with. In order that your Majesty may see the difference\r\nbetween what I here declare (which is the actual truth), and what\r\nthey wrote to your Majesty, accusing me of resisting _in toto_ the\r\ncommands of the Audiencia in regard to the cases of fuerça (which\r\nwas glaringly false testimony against me), I have decided--although\r\neverything touching the Audiencia is now settled, since your Majesty\r\nhas commanded it to be suppressed--to answer the account which they\r\ngave your Majesty about the places and the cases of fuerça. Although I\r\nam sure that my cause has been justified before God and those men who\r\nknow what has happened, I do it to satisfy your Majesty, to whom I owe\r\nall obedience and subjection as to my king and lord. I am even bound\r\nto explain my conduct; because, by the grace of God, your Majesty has\r\nno one in this kingdom who serves you with greater love and zeal. I\r\nclaim no payment nor temporal interest whatever, because this I\r\nneither desire nor demand; but I do only my duty, and that I do with\r\nall my might. I could send your Majesty good and sufficient proofs\r\nof everything which I have said here; for I certify, in all truth,\r\nthat everyone to whom I have shown these decrees has crossed himself\r\nin surprise that there should be a person or persons who would dare\r\nto make such malicious reports to your Majesty. It suffices me to say\r\nthat, if credit be not given me, not much time will pass before this\r\ntruth will be revealed, beyond all possibility of hiding.\r\n\r\nMay our Lord guard the royal person of your Majesty, and preserve\r\nyou many years. At Manila, the twenty-fourth of June, one thousand\r\nfive hundred and ninety.\r\n\r\n_Fray Domingo_, Bishop of the Filipinas.\r\n\r\n[_Endorsed_: \"To the king our lord, in his royal Council of the\r\nIndias. Filipinas. 1590. The bishop; June 24.\" \"Received and read,\r\nJune 19, of the year 1591. It is unnecessary to respond thereto.\"]\r\n\r\nSire:\r\n\r\nThe letter which your Majesty ordered to be written to me from San\r\nLorenço el Real [i.e., the Escorial], on the seventeenth of August of\r\neighty-nine, I received by the hand of the secretary of the governor,\r\nGomes Perez Dasmarinas, in the village of Tabuco, outside of this\r\ncity, on the first of June of this year ninety. And for one so beset\r\nwith afflictions, labors, and difficulties as I am, the favor which\r\nyour Majesty therein shows me was no little comfort; for I have been\r\nfreed by it from the pains of conscience, which I continually bore in\r\nmy soul, at seeing the course of affairs in this land. I held myself\r\nobliged by conscience to go in person to inform your Majesty of these\r\nmatters, as it appeared to me that my letters were accomplishing\r\nlittle, in accord with my hope that your Majesty would at once amend\r\nwhat you knew stood in need of betterment. And this thought gave me\r\nmore anxiety because, as at other times I have written your Majesty,\r\namong the calamities and misfortunes under which this land suffers,\r\nnone the least is that your Majesty must get information of them\r\nthrough the very men who have destroyed this land, and who work\r\nfor their private interests rather than for the common good. As\r\nthe reports are made by such persons, your Majesty can well see the\r\nresult. Therefore this land has come to its present misery; and the\r\nnew governor will have no small task if he maintains it, and saves it\r\nfrom ruin, and it is even now all but lost. I am emboldened to say this\r\nbecause hitherto there have been made to your Majesty many perverse\r\nreports; and by this ship we have received the decrees, by which it\r\nclearly appears that false reports were given your Majesty, because\r\nof the provisions made in these decrees, as I shall explain elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the religious and other principal persons of this\r\nland were of the same opinion as I, maintaining that I was in duty\r\nbound to go in person and give your Majesty an account of affairs here,\r\nbecause they see that everything here is going to ruin; and that this\r\ncommon expedient was of greater importance than the harm that might be\r\ndone by my absence. But thanks be to God, in whose hands are the hearts\r\nof kings, and who put into the heart of your Majesty what is provided,\r\nordained, and commanded by this letter for the weal and betterment of\r\nall this land. If this be executed as your Majesty has ordered, the\r\ncountry may be helped; but hitherto there has been so much sloth and\r\ncarelessness in executing what your Majesty provides and orders for the\r\ngood of this land, that thus it has come to its present extremity. I\r\ntrust in our Lord that this state of affairs will not continue, but\r\nthat the principal aim of the governor and of all the rest will be\r\nto procure the good of these natives whom we have so afflicted.\r\n\r\nThis whole country has been well satisfied at your Majesty's\r\nsuppression of the Audiencia, for without doubt it was a greater\r\nburden than a country so feeble and poor could bear; although I was\r\nalways of the opinion that, if it were paid from Mexico, the Audiencia\r\nwould work no harm here. But what your Majesty orders and commands is\r\nexpedient for all of us; and so we hold it a great favor, especially\r\nas your Majesty sends in place of the Audiencia, as governor, Gomez\r\nPerez Dasmarinas--who, from the good example which he has furnished\r\nand the zeal which he has disclosed in the service of your Majesty\r\nand the good of these realms, has given universal satisfaction, and\r\nthe hope that he will improve the condition of the land, and give it\r\nthe orderly condition which it was losing. May the divine Majesty\r\npreserve in him these excellent intentions, and give him strength\r\nand grace to execute them; because as the heart of man is so hard to\r\nunderstand, and of itself so variable, and this land is so exposed,\r\nit is not strange that we fear some alteration, having seen it in\r\nothers who also gave excellent examples. But if the governor who has\r\nnow come to us shall persevere in what he has begun (as I hope in\r\nGod he will persevere), your Majesty has sent us the man whom we need.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Santiago de Vera came by command of your Majesty to\r\nestablish the Audiencia in this country, he set up for himself a seat\r\nof honor in the church, as the viceroys do. The adelantado, Miguel\r\nLopez de Legaspi, did not establish one, nor did the governors who\r\nafterward succeeded him. Gomez Perez, who is now governor, did not\r\nwish to set one up; for in this and in all other things he has shown\r\nhimself very moderate. But it seemed to me that he should not fail to\r\nestablish it, and thus at my importunity, and that of other persons,\r\nhe has done so. Because your Majesty has already honored him in other\r\nrespects, favoring him with a guard of halberdiers, and as people from\r\nall the kingdoms of the infidels by whom we are surrounded resort to\r\nthis city, and as these barbarians respect their superiors as gods,\r\nit did not appear to me to be right that the person who represented\r\nyour Majesty should discontinue the dignity which was required to\r\nrepresent you. And in order that your Majesty in the future may be\r\npleased to provide this land with a governor who shall be capable\r\nand worthy to use his authority, I beg your Majesty to approve this\r\nand send him the order to continue and make permanent the practice.\r\n\r\nThe twelve thousand ducats which your Majesty has ordered to be paid\r\nin three installments for the work on this church, were necessary\r\nenough, although I fear that they are to avail as little as the\r\nrest; because, although your Majesty has so often commanded it,\r\nand we on our part have exercised the greatest possible diligence,\r\nit has not been possible to draw out from the royal treasury what was\r\ndue from it for the said work; and so it has come to a standstill,\r\nor so little is done that it never advances. It really is a pity to\r\nsee a cathedral church, in a city containing so great a concourse of\r\nheathen, where divine offices are celebrated in a church of straw,\r\nin which, on the coming of a storm, no one can remain. Your Majesty\r\nwill see what the condition of the rest of the churches must be. It\r\ncertainly is a pity to see the little care there is in this matter,\r\nand the scandal occasioned to the heathen and the recent converts by\r\nthe little veneration that we who have so long been Christians bestow\r\nupon the temples in which we worship our God, for really many of them\r\nare not fit to serve as stables. I have given your Majesty an account\r\nof this before now. The two thousand ducats which your Majesty ordered\r\npaid from the treasury of Mexico for this work were not brought,\r\nbecause the governor could not bring the securities that were necessary\r\nto obtain that sum there, because of his hurried departure. Moreover,\r\nit should be understood that it will be very difficult to collect the\r\nportions to be paid by Indians and encomenderos, because of their want\r\nand poverty. And for this reason we do not dare to press them much,\r\ndeeming it better that the work should be done slowly than to harass\r\none who is unable to do more; and it has been the treasury of your\r\nMajesty which has aided us least.\r\n\r\nYour Majesty's command that the religious should not depart from the\r\nbishopric without license of your Majesty, or that of the governor and\r\nmyself, is a very just thing, and therefore it will be carried out;\r\nbecause it also seems fitting to me not to let the religious depart\r\nfrom here, where they are so few and so many are needed. Before this\r\nship arrived the president and I had despatched two Dominican religious\r\nto Chincheo, which is the province of China nearest to this land, and\r\nthe place whence all the Sangleys who come here to trade set forth. In\r\nthis departure there was a punctual observance of what your Majesty\r\ncommands in this clause of your letter, although we had not then\r\nreceived it. And owing to the fact that before we determined to send\r\nthem, and at the time when we sent them, there occurred many notable\r\nthings from which your Majesty should receive much satisfaction,\r\nI thought it better, in order not to make this letter so long, to\r\nplace them by themselves in another, which will accompany this one,\r\nin order to give your Majesty a more detailed account of things so\r\nworthy to be heard.\r\n\r\nWith regard to what your Majesty orders concerning the remission of\r\ntithes for twenty years to those who now come to settle and who may\r\ncome in the future, I would to God that the Spaniards were inclined to\r\ncultivate the land and to gather the fruits from it, rather than that\r\nwe should ever afflict the natives by tithes. But your Majesty should\r\nknow that when a man comes to this country, even if he were a beggar\r\nin Spain, here he seeks to be a gentleman, and is not willing to work,\r\nbut desires to have all serve him; and so no one will give himself to\r\nlabor, but undertakes trafficking in merchandise, and for this reason\r\nmilitary and all other kinds of training have been forgotten. From\r\nthis fact not a little damage will come to this land, if the governor\r\ndoes not regulate this. In the letter which the cabildo of the church\r\nwrote to your Majesty a much longer account is given of this.\r\n\r\nTo proceed informally [_de plano_], without insisting on legal\r\ntechnicalities [_sin llegar a tela de juicio_], and not to impose\r\npecuniary punishments in the suits which occur in these regions,\r\nis a most holy and necessary practice. I desire greatly that in the\r\ntribunals of your Majesty this be observed; in mine I have so provided,\r\nand this practice has been observed and henceforth will be observed\r\nwith greater rigor.\r\n\r\nHe who informed your Majesty of the disorderly manner in which have\r\nbeen collected the tributes of the encomiendas which are not fully\r\npacified, and how poorly the ordinances of your Majesty have been\r\nobserved, spoke the truth in this matter. The excess in this has\r\nbeen so great that it has been the cause of all the riots and the\r\nrevolt of the Indians, and of the deaths which have occurred among\r\nthe Spaniards. I have given your Majesty news of this, grieving\r\nfor the evils which have sprung from it. For the Indians of this\r\nprovince, in those places where the name of God has never entered,\r\nnor that of your Majesty, must feel resentful where they have seen\r\nneither ministers of instruction nor of justice; but only see that\r\neach year a dozen of soldiers with arquebuses come to their houses\r\nto take their property away from them, and the food upon which they\r\nlive, although their all is little enough. These collectors afflict,\r\nmaltreat, and torment them, and so leave them, until they return\r\nanother year to do the same. What else can these natives think of us,\r\nbut that we are tyrants, and that we come only to make our gain out\r\nof their property and their persons? And this will be very difficult\r\nto remedy, so distant from the rest are some of the encomiendas,\r\nwith water between, and so little fear of God have those who make\r\nthe collections. It may be that with the arrival of the new governor\r\nthere will be much improvement in this; although if he does not bear\r\nan order from your Majesty to change some measures which up to the\r\npresent have been in force, I have no hope of betterment.\r\n\r\nIn the next to the last clause of this letter your Majesty says that\r\nto remedy the present lack of instruction is my own special obligation,\r\nwhich I confess; and I have so appreciated this that, seeing the great\r\npresent need of instruction and the little help which I can offer,\r\nI am so disturbed and so filled with anxiety that, if I were able to\r\nleave the bishopric, I would try to flee from it. But if, inasmuch as\r\nyour Majesty declares to me my obligation, and puts in my charge what\r\nis lacking, you should give me, together with it, authority to right\r\naffairs, your Majesty would be relieved of responsibility, and I of\r\nanxiety, other than to make progress in learning my obligations. If\r\nI do not have authority and power to remedy this, I must live all my\r\nlife in anxiety and perturbation of spirit, because every year I see\r\nthem collect tribute from a race that is never given to understand\r\nwhy it is collected; nor is there any hope that they may be able to\r\nhave instruction, because of the great difficulty there is in giving\r\nit to them. Knowing that this is the legitimate title which we have\r\nin seeking tribute, your Majesty may see what peace of conscience\r\nhe can have who has all these souls in his charge, both those who\r\ncollect and those of whom collection is taken. To relieve me from the\r\nanguish in which I live, the only means of removing all difficulties\r\nis for your Majesty to send us a great number of religious of the\r\nfour orders already established here--without giving ear to those who\r\nspeak of a matter about which, in my opinion, they have no means of\r\njudging here. They say that some have tried to persuade your Majesty,\r\nwith no other spirit than that of the devil (who wishes to hinder\r\nso much good), that we have all the religious that are necessary. In\r\naddition to the thirty-seven Augustinians now here, more than three\r\nhundred others are needed; and even these will not be enough. Yet,\r\nwith this number great results would be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe first is that your Majesty would be fulfilling the obligation\r\nwhich you have toward these nations, in giving them instruction. They\r\nneed this, because of the ten divisions of this bishopric eight have\r\nno instruction; and some provinces have been paying tribute to your\r\nMajesty for more than twenty years, but without receiving on account\r\nof that any greater advantage than to be tormented by the tribute\r\nand afterward to go to hell.\r\n\r\nSecond, all the Indians who are to be pacified will then be found,\r\nbecause experience has already shown us that to think of finding the\r\nIndians with a force of soldiers is rather to lose them, and never\r\nto pacify them; while with religious they all become obedient with\r\ngreat good will. And, when they are pacified and converted, much\r\nlarger tributes can be exacted, and the increase of revenue in the\r\ntreasury of your Majesty from their tributes would be greater than the\r\namount spent in sending them religious; while the conscience of your\r\nMajesty would be free from the greatest weight which, in my judgment,\r\nit has in this land, because tributes are collected from Indians\r\nwho have never rendered obedience, and do not, as I have said above,\r\nknow why they are paying it.\r\n\r\nIn the last clause your Majesty orders me to charge myself with the\r\nprotection of the Indians of this bishopric. I receive this charge\r\nas a special favor; because, as it was, I was burdened with the same\r\nresponsibility, and with this commission I shall have, as your Majesty\r\nsays, more authority in order to render aid. And this provision was\r\nso necessary because, without it, I was able to do almost nothing to\r\nsuccor the Indians. And with this I think I shall be able to serve your\r\nMajesty more, and to advance the cause of those who shall come with\r\nthe charge of bishop, although the one joined to the other is of very\r\ngreat consequence. The Indians who have learned of it are very glad,\r\nsince the obligation which is due them from the Spaniards is of no\r\nconcern to the latter. And as it is from the hand of your Majesty,\r\nthis office, then, is of greater importance for the relief of the\r\nconscience of your Majesty and the preservation of the natives,\r\nthan any other one of all that are provided for afterward by the\r\ngovernor. I have not the wherewithal for the expenses which occur;\r\nfor there must necessarily be a notary, interpreter, and lawyer,\r\nand persons who with my authorization shall be present to plead the\r\nsuits--which will not be a few, and cannot be carried through without\r\nspending money--since I am not able, nor is it right that I should be\r\non hand to present the petition, or to plead the causes and business\r\nof so much weight and authority. To take this task of being my agent,\r\nsome honest man, however honorable his station, should be glad to do\r\nit. It is necessary that he be a person of great credit and of resolute\r\nmind, that he may not fear to defend the Indians, although at the risk\r\nof injury from those who harm them, and this seldom fails to come to\r\npass, as the disputes are often with those who are very powerful.\r\n\r\nIt will also be necessary to send persons from this city through\r\nall the bishopric to investigate the injuries that the Indians\r\nsuffer. Before they go to do this, I shall have notice of what is\r\nhappening; and this is to be done at the cost of your Majesty's\r\ntreasury, in order not to give occasion for the robbery of the\r\nIndians, if they should have to pay them. All this is necessary in\r\norder that I should be able to perform well this office, and relieve\r\nthe conscience of your Majesty and my own; because many are the wrongs\r\nwhich the Indians receive in this bishopric from your encomenderos,\r\nthe alcaldes-mayor, and the tax-receivers; and, the farther away they\r\nare, the greater the wrongs and the more difficult the remedy. I humbly\r\nbeseech your Majesty to be pleased to command provision to be made as\r\nI here request, because otherwise my protection will be only nominal\r\nand ineffectual. I have already discussed this with the governor,\r\nand I understand that he will make provision in some of these things,\r\nbecause the necessity is very urgent; and for the remainder we wait\r\nwhat your Majesty is pleased to command. The friendly intercourse which\r\nyour Majesty commands me to observe with the governor, your Majesty\r\nmay be assured will not be lacking on my part; and I understand that\r\nwithout doubt there will be as little lack on the part of the governor,\r\nbecause in the little intercourse that I have had with him I have\r\nconceived very great hopes of him. And I believe that God inspired\r\nyour Majesty to send him to us--although, as I have known him only\r\na little while, I am not able to express more than what I hope.\r\n\r\nBecause there is no mention made of the Sangleys in the clause of\r\nthe letter in which your Majesty commands me to take charge of the\r\nprotection of these natives, the governor has considered--and this\r\nis his opinion--that because we were not there named, neither I nor\r\nmy agent could answer for them, as for the natives. May your Majesty\r\nbe pleased to command what is to be done in this case, because the\r\nSangleys have so much more need of protection than the natives. In\r\nthe meanwhile, according to the wish of the governor, I shall not\r\ncease to aid in whatever may concern them, just as if I had been\r\nappointed to look after them by your Majesty; and my agent will do\r\nthe same, in those matters which belong to him as such. May our Lord\r\npreserve the royal person of your Majesty for many years.

I prohibit and forbid\r\nall other persons whomsoever, of whatever rank and preeminence, from\r\ntrading in the said islands and in China for the space of the said\r\nsix years, reckoned as above stated, under penalty of confiscation\r\nof the merchandise that they have traded for therein. I order that\r\nthis my provision be promulgated in the City of Mexico, and that\r\nmy royal officials there enter it in their books. Those of the said\r\nislands shall do likewise, and they shall endorse on the back of this\r\nsaid provision the date upon which it took effect, by the departure\r\nfrom port of the first vessel with the said merchandise. They shall\r\nsend me a separate attestation of the same, so that I may know when\r\nthe said six years are to be in force. And neither one nor the other\r\nshall do anything contrary to this order.

Sant Lorenzo, July 23, 1590.\" Without other\r\nsignature than a rubrica or flourish.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Collection of Tributes in the Filipinas Islands 1591\r\n\r\n\r\n_Source_: This document is obtained from copies of the original MSS.,\r\nin the Archivo general de Indias, Sevilla.\r\n\r\n_Translation_: It is synopsized, and partially translated, by Emma\r\nHelen Blair; the remaining translation is by Frederic W. Morrison,\r\nof Harvard University, and Norman F. Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Collection of Tributes in the Filipinas Islands\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum of the Resources of the Hospital of Manila and Its Needs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe royal hospital for the Spaniards possesses about\r\none hundred taes of gold in the encomienda of Darandum\r\nin Ylocos, which was assigned to the said hospital\r\nby Doctor Sande.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDC pesos\r\n\r\nIt possesses, further, six hundred pesos, which were\r\ngranted to it by the president from the encomienda\r\nwhich fell vacant because of the death of Don Luis\r\nde Sahajosa, in Ylocos.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDC pesos\r\n\r\nIt possesses one thousand five hundred fanegas of rice,\r\nand one thousand seven hundred fowls, assigned by\r\nthe president from the tributes of Caruya and Lubao,\r\nwhich belong to his Majesty.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  DLXX pesos\r\n\r\nIt possesses what your Lordship assigned it in the\r\nencomienda of Bondoy Moron, which, it is thought,\r\nwill amount to more than eight hundred or nine\r\nhundred pesos.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    IU pesos\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t----------------\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIIU.DCCLXX pesos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the above, the said hospital cannot even support the expenses\r\nincurred for food and for services rendered by the Indians. It likewise\r\nneeds a doctor, medicine, nurses, and other services, as well as\r\nexceptional delicacies, bed clothes, and tents. Indeed half the\r\nmoney is expended in the anointings and sweatings which are applied\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\nThere is also needed a chaplain, who is usually attached to the said\r\nhospital, to administer the sacraments to the sick.\r\n\r\nThe building of the said hospital does not suffice for its needs. It\r\ncontains but one hall, where all classes of sick people are packed\r\ntogether, to their own detriment. Another infirmary is greatly needed\r\nfor patients who suffer from buboes, and for anointings and sweatings;\r\nthere are many sick with this disease, since this country is well\r\nsuited to produce it. The said hospital also needs a room for the\r\nconvalescents, for lack of which many relapses are wont to occur.\r\n\r\nWe also need quarters for sick women, for many poor creatures do not\r\nrecover because they have no money, and no place where they can go.\r\n\r\nLikewise, the said hospital is in need of a kitchen, utensils, and\r\nquarters for its servants, all of which things are needful therein\r\nfor the suitable outfit and service of the said hospital.\r\n\r\nThe captain _Cuenca_, as director of the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion and Conclusions of the Bishop Concerning the Matter\r\nof Tributes\r\n\r\n_Jesus_\r\n\r\nInasmuch as I understand that some of the encomenderos, and especially\r\nthose from Camarines, have gone, or desire to go, to ask permission\r\nof your Lordship to collect from their encomiendas, in which they\r\nnever have, nor do they at present, maintain religious instruction,\r\nI have deemed it best to send to your Lordship a brief statement\r\nof what I and the theologians of this bishopric feel concerning the\r\ncollections in the aforesaid encomiendas, in order that your Lordship\r\nmay understand how and in what way they are to be licensed to make\r\nthese collections. [45] Although the king, our lord, has unburdened\r\nhis royal conscience by entrusting it to your Lordship and to myself,\r\nI see no reason why we should weigh down our own souls and consciences\r\nwith what others are to eat and expend.\r\n\r\nThe encomiendas existing in these islands are, in general, divided into\r\ntwo classes; for some of them have had and do still have religious\r\ninstruction, and others have never had it in the past, nor do they\r\nenjoy it at present. The encomiendas which do not possess instruction\r\nare themselves divided into two classes: the first consists of those\r\nwhich have not had, and now have not, any religious instruction,\r\nnor have they ever received from their encomenderos spiritual or\r\ntemporal benefits; on the contrary, their present condition is such\r\nthat it would seem the Spaniards had never gone thither to do aught\r\nelse than to reduce and conquer them in order to exact tributes. We\r\nmay even say that the encomiendas are in worse condition than if the\r\nSpaniards had never come, for, with the harsh treatment and oppression\r\nthat they have received at our hands, they are at present further\r\nfrom receiving the law of God than if they had never known us. The\r\nsecond class consists of the encomiendas which, although they have\r\nnot been instructed, have received from their encomenderos, or by\r\nmeans of them, some temporal advantages which tend toward spiritual\r\nbenefits, which prepare them so that they may be instructed, and\r\nthat one may live among them in security. In the first division are\r\nincluded the encomiendas of Calamianes, which at present belong to\r\nCaptain Sarmyento; the islands of Cuyo, which belong to Captain Juan\r\nPablo de Carrion; the encomiendas which are in the islands of Mindanao\r\nand Jolo, and on the coast opposite, Mindoro and Elin; the encomiendas\r\ncalled Zambales, which extend from Maribeles to Pangasinan; in Ylocos,\r\nthe valley of Dinglas, and the encomiendas which extend from Ylagua to\r\nCagayan, and all those of Cagayan; and those which extend along the\r\nfarther coast from Cagayan to Mavban; and, finally, all those other\r\nislands of like character, which I do not at present remember. In all\r\nthe aforementioned places, it has been hitherto impossible to collect\r\nthe tributes, and it will likewise be impossible in the future, should\r\nthey continue to maintain their present attitude; but whatever has\r\nthus far been collected from them we are under obligations to restore.\r\n\r\nIn the other division are included all the remaining encomiendas of\r\nthe Pintados, with the exception of a few in Panay where there is\r\nreligious instruction. In the above division are included the islands\r\nof Leite, Negros, Babao, Balon, and Bohol; and, in the island of Panay,\r\nthe encomienda of Captain Pedro Sarmiento; the encomienda of Axuy,\r\nwhich belongs to his Majesty and to Francisco de Rribera; the tingues\r\n[hills] of the river of Araud which belong to his Majesty and to\r\nCaptain Juan Pablo de Carrion and two or three other encomenderos;\r\nthe islands of Marinduque and Masbate, and all the others which\r\nextend thence to the mouth of the channel; in Camarines, the islands\r\nof Catanduanes and Lagunay, and those along the coast and many others\r\nwhich are in this condition. In all the aforesaid places it may be\r\nconsidered a general rule that religious teaching did not, and does\r\nnot exist--or at least has existed for so short a time that it is\r\npractically the same as if it had never existed. Moreover, from all\r\nthe aforesaid places and from others like them, since they have been\r\nin such condition that one could travel through them in security (and,\r\nif ministers should come, their inhabitants could be instructed), it\r\nhas been possible to collect a certain amount of tribute, for aid,\r\nand support, and expenses. Not all, or even half, of the tributes,\r\nhowever, could be collected; if the encomiendas are rather large, only\r\nthe third part is obtained, and if they are small, only half. Moreover,\r\nwhatever collections were made from these encomiendas could not be\r\nmade until they had been prepared as aforesaid. Inasmuch as this\r\nmatter is a most difficult one, on account of the danger incurred\r\nin collecting from the Indians what they do not owe, and when they\r\nare not willing that it should be collected, and of depriving the\r\nencomenderos of what is due them in case they have fulfilled their\r\nobligations toward the Indians, this shall be the rule regarding\r\nsuch action as has been taken hitherto by the confessors, namely,\r\nthat an encomendero who has simply made collections among the Indians,\r\nwithout having done them any temporal or spiritual good, shall not be\r\nentitled to collect any tributes; if, however, through his endeavors,\r\nor by trading with them, they are so well-inclined that he can go about\r\nsafely among them, and they themselves can be instructed when they\r\nhave ministers, the encomenderos shall be entitled to collect from\r\nthem the portion which we have named above. In order that from this\r\ntime forth, the king in the royal encomiendas, and the encomenderos in\r\ntheirs, may, as has been stated, collect the third part or the half,\r\nthe following conditions must be observed:\r\n\r\nFirst: That the encomenderos shall endeavor, with the utmost diligence\r\nand care, to establish sufficient religious instruction in their\r\nencomiendas. In case they are unable to do so, they shall write\r\nto his Majesty, requesting him to provide the necessary number of\r\nministers to teach the Indians; and they shall ask this so earnestly\r\nand effectively that his Majesty will feel himself under obligation\r\nto send ministers. They shall likewise offer, if it be necessary, to\r\npay a part of the expenses which his Majesty shall incur in sending\r\nthe ministers.\r\n\r\nSecond: In case ministers cannot at once be found to instruct the\r\nnatives, orders shall meanwhile be given as to how the encomenderos\r\nare to reside in their lands. This should not be done in the manner\r\nwhich has been hitherto practiced, when some of the encomenderos\r\nhoping thus to reduce their expenses go to live in their encomiendas\r\n(indeed, I know not if there are any who act otherwise), and there\r\nemploy the Indians in the service of themselves, their families,\r\nand their houses, taking away their possessions at the lowest price,\r\nand treating them as if they were their slaves. They care nothing\r\nfor instructing the natives, or setting them a good example, or\r\npreparing them to receive baptism; on the contrary they exasperate\r\nthe Indians with their harsh treatment, and cause them to abhor the\r\nlaw of God. Such encomenderos as these should not reside in their\r\nencomiendas: the governor ought to forbid them even to visit those\r\nplaces, and should himself appoint such person or persons as would\r\nfulfil toward the Indians the obligations which rest upon encomenderos.\r\n\r\nThird: In the encomiendas of the king, and in those of the encomenderos\r\nwho, for the aforesaid reasons, ought not reside in their encomiendas,\r\nsuch persons shall be appointed, with the approbation of the bishop\r\n(to whom his Majesty has entrusted this care, and which of right falls\r\nto him), as shall fulfil those obligations toward the aforesaid natives\r\nwhich are incumbent upon encomenderos, conformably to the law of God\r\nand to what his Majesty has provided and commanded in his laws and\r\nordinances--in order that in this manner the Indians may be pacified\r\nand appeased; and so prepared that, when they shall have ministers,\r\nthey can receive instruction from them. Under these conditions and\r\nlimitations, the king in his encomiendas, and the encomenderos in\r\ntheirs, may collect from the said encomiendas something from their\r\ncurrent products, for help, maintenance, and expenses. That would be\r\na third part of the tributes, if the encomiendas are large and the\r\nreligious teaching sufficient therein; but if the encomiendas are\r\nsmall it would be half, as has already been stated.\r\n\r\nAmong the encomiendas which maintain religious instruction\r\n(although none, or very few, have enough of it), there are some whose\r\ninhabitants, although including some Christians, are for the most part\r\ninfidels, and so ill-disposed and so unfavorably situated that it is\r\nimpossible for them to receive the instruction, since there are not\r\nenough ministers in the said encomiendas. Even though instruction\r\nexists therein, no tribute, or at least very little, ought to be\r\nexacted of the infidels until they have ministers to teach them,\r\nand the encomendero influences them to give consent, so that they can\r\nbe taught. In this class of encomiendas are included the tingues of\r\nSilanga, Pasi, Tabuco, and Maragondon; those of Pangasinan, and others\r\nin Ylocos; and the rest in the island of Panay. These encomiendas\r\nare among those which have religious instruction: the others have\r\nalready been enumerated.\r\n\r\nThe encomenderos of these islands have fallen into an error, based upon\r\na misunderstanding of a decree of the king, in which he commands that\r\na fourth part of the tributes from the encomiendas shall be set aside\r\nin order to construct churches and to provide for divine worship. They\r\nimagine that by virtue of this decree those encomiendas which have\r\nnever had religious teaching may collect the entire tribute, after\r\nsetting aside a fourth part of it. Moreover, but a small number have\r\nset aside this fourth part, and they have done it very seldom. It\r\nis an unbearable deception for the encomenderos to hold this view,\r\nfor this decree does not refer to the encomiendas which, as we have\r\nsaid, are deprived of religious teaching. As for the latter, not only\r\ncan the king not give them license to collect their tributes, but,\r\neven were he here, he himself could not collect them. The aforesaid\r\ndecree, moreover, treats not of these, but of the encomiendas whose\r\ninhabitants are already Christian. It is with regard to these that the\r\nking commands that a fourth part of the tributes be appropriated for\r\nthe construction of churches; and that in place of the tithes which\r\nthey, as Christians, owe to the ministers for their maintenance, a\r\ncertain part of the tributes be appropriated in such wise as may be\r\nhere decided. Afterward, I shall satisfactorily prove that it never\r\nentered the king's mind that the encomenderos would, by renouncing\r\nthe fourth part of the tributes, fulfil their obligations toward\r\ntheir encomiendas.\r\n\r\nThe above is a summary of the contents of the opinion which I am\r\npreparing, wherein may be found a more extensive treatment of what I\r\nhave here set down. In that document your Lordship will find complete\r\nproofs of what is contained in this summary, accompanied by arguments\r\nso cogent and convincing that there is neither room nor possibility\r\nfor doubt in this matter.\r\n\r\nTwo other points are to be found in the clauses furnished to me by\r\nthe secretary, Juan de Cuellar, drawn from the instructions which the\r\nking, our lord, gave to your Lordship for the good government of this\r\nland. In one of them there is a discussion of the two reals which his\r\nMajesty ordered to be added to the tributes hitherto collected. It\r\nalso contains the views of the theologians of this bishopric, and\r\nmy own, concerning this increase. Your Lordship will find them all\r\nin the document which, as I said above, I am preparing. Inasmuch as\r\nthe execution of that clause is not immediately pressing, it has not\r\nseemed to me necessary to discuss it here.\r\n\r\nThe other clause deals with the means to be employed in establishing\r\nreligious instruction in the small encomiendas and districts where\r\nthe said instruction does not exist. Concerning this we shall have\r\nbut little to say at present, not because the affair is free from very\r\ngreat difficulties, in undertaking to accomplish his Majesty's orders\r\nas contained in the aforesaid clause; but because there is no present\r\noccasion for anxiety regarding the establishment of this instruction,\r\ninasmuch as there are no ministers to undertake the work. I will only\r\nsay that, if his Majesty does not decree that the small encomiendas\r\nbe made into a few large ones, it will be most difficult (and indeed\r\nalmost impossible) to establish therein religious instruction.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this, your Lordship will see how you are to give\r\npermission to the encomenderos who do not maintain instruction, so\r\nthat they may collect from their encomiendas, if your Lordship wishes\r\nto make secure your own encomienda [46] which I, by this statement,\r\nhave enabled you to do.\r\n\r\nMay Jesus Christ, our Lord, bestow upon your Lordship the light of\r\nHis grace, so that in all matters you may be enabled to accomplish\r\nHis holy will, and secure the welfare and protection of these natives,\r\nwhich they so sorely need. From our house, on the twelfth of January\r\nof the year one thousand five hundred and ninety-one.\r\n\r\n_Fray Domingo_, Bishop of the Filipinas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of the Decision Reached by the Bishop of these Philipinas\r\nIslands, and the Other Theologians of this Bishopric, Concerning the\r\nCollection of the Tributes Therein\r\n\r\n_Jesus_\r\n\r\nThe first conclusion:  From the encomiendas which have not had and\r\ndo not have religious instruction, and have never received from\r\nthe encomenderos any other benefit or advantage, either spiritual\r\nor temporal, than the collection of the tributes, then being left\r\nin their former condition (and such are most of the encomiendas in\r\nthis bishopric), the tributes should not be exacted. But in case\r\nthey have already been exacted, or shall be in the future, and the\r\nencomenderos shall have done no more good therein than they have thus\r\nfar, those who have made these collections shall be compelled to make\r\nrestitution therefor to the natives of the said encomiendas. This\r\nsame obligation also binds those who, being obliged by their office,\r\nand having the power to prevent this evil, shall give license, or\r\nconsent, or permission, that these collections be made.\r\n\r\nSecond conclusion: In the encomiendas which, although they may not\r\nhave had or at present have religious instruction (or so little,\r\nand for so short a space of time, that no result can be observed),\r\nhave been pacified through the earnest endeavors and good works of\r\nthe encomendero, and whose inhabitants are so subdued as to permit of\r\ntravel and residence among them, and favorably disposed to receive\r\ninstruction in case there should be anyone to impart it to them;\r\nthe encomenderos shall be allowed to collect a certain portion of the\r\ntributes--as, for example, the third part, if the encomiendas are of\r\naverage size (for, if they are large, it is a great deal to collect the\r\nthird part), and one half, if they are small--by which we understand\r\na population of three hundred Indians, or a less number. The tributes\r\nthus collected are granted as aid for the encomendero's maintenance,\r\nand for the expenses of said pacification.\r\n\r\nThird conclusion: All that was collected from the Indians before they\r\nwere thus rendered willing to pay must be restored to them by those\r\nwho made such collection, or by those who permitted it, as is stated\r\nin the preceding clause.\r\n\r\nFourth conclusion: All the rest of the said half or third part\r\nwhich has been or shall hereafter be levied upon the Indians,\r\nbefore they shall have received sufficient religious instruction,\r\nmust be restored by those who have made or permitted to be made the\r\naforesaid collections.\r\n\r\nFifth conclusion: From the encomiendas which have received sufficient\r\nreligious instruction and whose inhabitants are all, or for the\r\nmost part, Christians; or when those who are not Christians have\r\nvoluntarily held back from conversion--all of the tributes may be\r\ncollected, provided that care be ever taken that the infidels be\r\npersuaded and not compelled or forced to make these payments: indeed,\r\nas much concern should be had for them as for the others. Let it\r\nbe understood that the said infidels do not refuse or be adverse to\r\nbecoming Christians; for in this case the tributes may not be exacted\r\nfrom them--or, at least, not all, and even then with their consent.\r\n\r\nSixth conclusion: In the encomiendas where there are infidels who,\r\nthrough lack of adequate religious instruction, have not received\r\nbaptism, taxes should not in the past nor shall they at present\r\nbe collected in full, but according to the manner set down in the\r\nsecond clause.\r\n\r\nSeventh conclusion: Although all the inhabitants may be Christians,\r\nif their religious instruction has been insufficient the encomenderos\r\nare obliged to deduct from the tributes all that should be expended for\r\na sufficient number of ministers to impart the necessary instruction.\r\n\r\nEighth conclusion: In order that an encomienda may be said to possess\r\nsufficient and adequate religious instruction, the minister should not\r\nbe burdened with the care of more souls than he can properly instruct\r\nand direct in spiritual matters, so that he can give to all those who\r\nare infidels suitable instruction in Christian doctrine--not merely\r\nso that they know it by rote, but also so that they may understand\r\n(so far as they are capable of this) the signification of the words,\r\nand the mysteries contained therein. Thus, too, he will be able to make\r\neach and every one of them understand all that is necessary for them\r\nto believe, and know, and do, in order to be good Christians. All this\r\nshould be done before baptism is conferred upon them; and like efforts\r\nshould be made that no one shall die without the sacrament. When the\r\nminister undertakes to baptize them, he must see that they know well\r\nwhat it is, and are prepared for it, and understand what they are\r\nreceiving--namely, that they are dead to their past life, and are\r\ncommencing a new one, and from that time forth are new men. As the\r\ninhabitants of many of these islands have received baptism without\r\nthe aforesaid solicitude and preparation, many sacrileges have been\r\ncommitted; and, as a result, many and great misfortunes have ensued,\r\nwhich we can now clearly discern, and yet but poorly remedy.\r\n\r\nIn order that the Indians, after their conversion, may have adequate\r\nreligious teaching, and be taught and instructed and guided in the\r\nconduct of their souls, a minister should not have the care of more\r\nIndians than he can know, visit, and minister to in such wise that\r\nall may understand and comprehend the doctrine. Then, if anyone is\r\nsick, the minister can know of it, and visit and console him in his\r\nsickness; and if the sick man be poor, the minister can give him what\r\nhe may need, or shall find someone to do so, so that the sick man may\r\nnot die without confession or extreme unction. To the living who are\r\nprepared for it, he can administer the eucharist, and can persuade\r\neveryone to prepare himself so that he can receive communion, and\r\ncan labor with all earnestness in making known the great benefits\r\nwhich are contained in the most blessed sacrament, and how much is\r\nlost by those who do not partake thereof, and the obligation of all\r\nChristians to receive it. The minister can thus also personally care\r\nfor the burial of the dead; and, in short, fulfil with solicitude and\r\nconcern all the demands and obligations of his office as a priest,\r\nand in the care of souls. It is because the ministers in the Indias\r\nare burdened with so many souls, that we observe so little Christianity\r\nthere, that so many die without the sacraments, and there are so many\r\ninfidels to be converted.\r\n\r\nNinth conclusion: As soon as the Indians shall have become Christians\r\nthe encomendero may with good conscience exact from them the tributes\r\nwhich are imposed and regulated by his Majesty or by persons\r\ncommissioned by him; and the Indians are bound by conscience and\r\njustice to pay them, if they have adequate religious instruction\r\nand the encomendero fulfils the obligations imposed upon him by his\r\nacceptance of the encomienda.\r\n\r\nTenth conclusion: The encomenderos are under obligation to observe,\r\nexactly and faithfully, the instructions given them, that they may not\r\ntransgress these in regard to the kind of tributes to be paid, or to\r\nthe age or condition of those who must pay them--under pain of mortal\r\nsin, and of making restitution for what they shall have exacted in\r\nviolation of law or beyond the amount assessed. The damages moreover,\r\nwhich are sustained by the natives in compelling them to pay tributes\r\nwhich they are not bound to pay, and the expenses incurred in making\r\nthe collections, should be at the cost of the encomenderos and not\r\nthat of the Indians.\r\n\r\nEleventh conclusion: It is grievous inhumanity and a sort of cruel\r\ntyranny to seize the chiefs and keep them prisoners until they pay\r\nthe tribute of those who fail to do so; and it is a much greater\r\nwrong to afflict and torture them while in durance. He who shall\r\nmake collections in this manner, or permit them to be thus made,\r\nis, aside from the mortal sin which he commits, bound to restore to\r\nthe chiefs the tributes thus exacted from them; and would be most\r\nfittingly punished by being deprived of the encomienda of which,\r\nthrough his own wrong-doing, he has made himself unworthy.\r\n\r\nTwelfth conclusion: Although the encomiendas are given to the\r\nencomenderos in return for their services to the king, our lord, the\r\nprincipal aim and object of his Majesty in giving them has not been,\r\nnor can it be, only that the Indians should pay tribute and render\r\nservice to the encomenderos; but, on the contrary, that in return for\r\nthe tributes which are paid them, the encomendero shall be obliged\r\nto provide the Indians with ministers to instruct and care for them,\r\nto defend and protect them, to see that they are not ill-treated,\r\nand to answer for them in all necessary matters. It therefore follows\r\nthat the encomiendas are and should be instituted rather for the\r\ngood of the Indians than for that of the encomenderos; and that the\r\nencomenderos cannot be termed, nor are they, the lords of the Indians,\r\nbut their attorneys, tutors, and protectors.\r\n\r\nThirteenth conclusion: The tributes which the king, our lord, has\r\nimposed upon the Indians are not, nor can, nor should they be, all for\r\nhis Majesty or for the encomenderos--to whom he allots them in order\r\nthat from this fund may be taken all that is necessary to support the\r\nministers of religious instruction, and for the embellishment of the\r\nchurches and divine worship.\r\n\r\nFourteenth conclusion: The encomenderos who, to avoid or lessen\r\nexpense, neglect to employ in their encomiendas all the ministers\r\nneeded to accomplish and fulfil what has been set down in the eighth\r\nconclusion are in mortal sin, and cannot be absolved. Moreover, it\r\nis not enough to say that their encomiendas already have ministers;\r\nthey must employ as many of these as are necessary to fulfil all the\r\nduties there enumerated, according to the number of souls contained\r\nin their encomiendas. And the said encomenderos are responsible\r\nfor all the injuries and evils referred to in the said conclusion,\r\nif through their fault there are not ministers to do what should be\r\ndone. The minister or ministers, moreover, are responsible if, when\r\nthey have in their care so many Indians that they cannot properly\r\nminister to them, they shall be unwilling to receive or to look for\r\nother ministers to help them.\r\n\r\nFifteenth conclusion: The number of ministers required for each\r\ncommunity cannot be readily determined, since there are not in all\r\nthe encomiendas the same conditions existing; in some, the people live\r\ncloser together than in others; and where they are more scattered, or\r\nmore difficult of access, more ministers will be needed than when they\r\nlive nearer one another. When they are thus near, and well disposed,\r\nfive hundred Indians are a sufficient number for one conscientious\r\nminister to take in charge; and when we shall have an abundant\r\nnumber of ministers, they should be stationed in each encomienda,\r\nin that ratio.\r\n\r\nSixteenth conclusion: If through lack of ministers enough cannot be\r\nplaced in each encomienda to give adequate instruction, such as can\r\nbe obtained at the time should be employed, and the encomenderos\r\nshall remain under obligation to deduct from the tributes what has\r\nbeen stated in the seventh conclusion.\r\n\r\nSeventeenth conclusion: All that the Indians have expended in erecting\r\nchurches and houses for the ministers, and in their maintenance,\r\nthrough the unwillingness of the encomenderos to pay therefor, the\r\nlatter are obliged to make good--the entire amount expended, for the\r\nmaintenance of the ministers; and of that expended for churches and\r\nhouses, their share.\r\n\r\nEighteenth conclusion: In order that, from this time forth, the\r\nencomenderos who do not maintain religious instruction may collect from\r\ntheir encomiendas the portion which is stated in the second conclusion,\r\nthe following conditions shall be observed: (1) They shall endeavor,\r\nmost assiduously and earnestly, to establish religious instruction\r\nin their encomiendas, that such establishment shall not be delayed;\r\nor, if it be not made, so that the lack cannot be imputed to their\r\nnegligence and indifference. And, inasmuch as we have not here\r\nthe requisite number of ministers, the encomenderos shall inform\r\nhis Majesty how great is the lack, and supplicate him promptly to\r\nsend ministers hither--offering, if it shall be necessary, to pay\r\na part of the expenses to be incurred in sending them hither. (2)\r\nThe encomenderos shall endeavor, personally or through the medium of\r\npersons skilled and competent, in whom may be placed entire confidence\r\nthat they will deal with the Indians as God requires and the king\r\ncommands, to defend the Indians and protect them against the injuries\r\ninflicted upon them. They shall strive to influence them, by good\r\nworks and example, to accept the law of God, most carefully preparing\r\nthem so that, when they have ministers of the Christian doctrine,\r\nthey can be instructed. They shall not act as do some encomenderos\r\n(and most of them are of this sort) who visit their encomiendas\r\nnot for the good of the Indians, but for their own profit; and who,\r\nthrough their presence, work more injury to the Indians by the many\r\ngrievances which they occasion, and the bad example that they set,\r\nthan the latter are advantaged in being thus pacified.\r\n\r\nNineteenth conclusion: It has been a very great error on the part\r\nof the encomenderos in these islands who do not maintain religious\r\ninstruction to think that because they contribute a fourth part of the\r\ntributes they may collect and keep for themselves the remainder. This\r\nis based upon their misinterpretation of a decree of the king which\r\nstates the portion which is to be appropriated from the tributes for\r\nthe erection of churches and the support of the ministers (although\r\nthis decree has already been annulled by others). This decree did\r\nnot apply to the encomiendas which we here mention; for if the king\r\nhimself cannot levy tributes, he could ill permit others to do so,\r\nexcepting the encomiendas which we discussed in the ninth conclusion.\r\n\r\nTwentieth conclusion: What has been already said in the preceding\r\nconclusions concerning the encomenderos likewise applies to the\r\nencomiendas which belong to the royal crown; for the king is under even\r\ngreater obligation than are the encomenderos to provide his Indians\r\nwith religious teaching; and to the same extent as they, he is bound\r\nto make restitution of all that has been unjustly collected. It\r\nfollows from this that the officials of the royal exchequer, who\r\nare charged with the collection, of the tributes for the king, are\r\nobliged in conscience to observe and fulfil all that is stated in the\r\npreceding conclusions, and to make restitution of all the tributes,\r\nor such part of them as has been or shall be collected contrary to\r\nthe tenor of the said conclusions. This obligation is all the greater\r\nfor the governor than for the officials of the royal exchequer; since\r\nhe, by reason of his office, is bound to care for all the natives of\r\nthese islands, and not to permit them to be wronged, and to require\r\nsatisfaction from anyone who may wrong them.\r\n\r\nTwenty-first conclusion: Former governors were under obligation, as\r\nare those who rule both now and hereafter, to observe and fulfil, in\r\nthe repartimientos which they assign or shall assign, the provisions\r\ncontained in section 144 of the royal ordinances drawn up in Segovia\r\nin the year 73, the tenor of which is as follows: \"When the country\r\nhas been pacified, and its rulers and inhabitants have been reduced\r\nto obedience to us, the governor shall, with their consent, direct\r\nthe partition of the lands among the colonists so that each of them\r\nshall be responsible for the Indians of his repartimiento, defend\r\nand protect them, and provide a minister who shall teach them to live\r\nin civilized ways, and shall do for them all else that encomenderos\r\nare bound to do for the Indians of their repartimientos.\" In the\r\nfollowing section: \"The Indians who shall be reduced to our obedience\r\nand allotted to the conquerors shall be persuaded, in recognition of\r\nuniversal seigniory and jurisdiction which we hold over the Indians,\r\nto assist us by the payment of a moderate tribute, from the fruits of\r\nthe soil. It is our will that the tributes thus paid us be collected\r\nby the Spaniards to whom encomiendas shall be given, for which reason\r\nthey fulfil the duties to which they are bound.\" What his Majesty\r\ncommands in these two sections of the said ordinances conforms to both\r\nnatural and divine law, both of which would be violated if even the\r\nking should contravene these ordinances. From this the governors will\r\nrecognize the obligations under which they are to heed the attitude\r\nof the Indians whom they must allot in encomiendas, in order not to\r\nwork against a law as just and necessary as this is.\r\n\r\nTwenty-second conclusion: If in any case the governor allot an\r\nencomienda whose inhabitants shall not be in the frame of mind\r\nwhich the aforesaid law requires (a condition which must needs be\r\nvery rare, and the result of causes so forcible that the king, upon\r\nconsultation, would consider them of sufficient weight), in order that\r\nthe governor may not be under obligation to make restitution of what\r\nshall be collected therefrom, he is bound to order such encomendero\r\nnot to collect the tributes until he has, by his earnest endeavors\r\nand just treatment, brought the Indians to that disposition which,\r\nin the aforesaid two sections, his Majesty requires. In case the\r\nencomendero shall collect the tributes beforehand, the governor shall\r\ncommand him to make restitution; and if, for lack of such orders,\r\nthe Indians shall suffer any wrong, the governor shall be responsible.\r\n\r\nTwenty-third conclusion: The religious who are in the Indias are not\r\nunder obligation to go to Spain to obtain other religious; and if they\r\ncould avoid it they would do wrong in going on account of the great\r\ndeficiency of ministers caused by such departures. But as the need\r\nof ministers is so great, and as they are not sent hither from Spain,\r\nthose who go thither to procure them should be well rewarded for the\r\ngreat hardships that they undergo in bringing religious. His Majesty,\r\nmoreover, and the members of his royal Council are under obligation\r\nto send back at once, and with suitable provision, those who in their\r\nservice to God and the king, and for the welfare of these souls,\r\nhave suffered such hardships.\r\n\r\nTwenty-fourth conclusion: The king our lord and his royal Council\r\nof the Indias are bound to send to these islands so many ministers\r\nthat they can give adequate instruction to all the natives therein,\r\neven if our religious do not go or send for others.\r\n\r\nTwenty-fifth conclusion: His Majesty is bound to give orders and to\r\nmake all possible efforts for the conversion of the infidels--not\r\nonly those who recognize him and pay tribute, but those who are\r\nnot under his sway and do not recognize him as their lord--so that\r\nthey may all come into the knowledge of God and enter the bosom of\r\nthe Church. Nor should this be accomplished in the manner hitherto\r\nemployed employed--namely, by the perversion of all law, divine\r\nand human; by murders, robberies, captivities, conflagrations, and\r\nthe depopulation of villages, estates, and houses. These wrongs are\r\ninflicted and perpetrated by those who, under pretext and in the name\r\nof preaching the gospel, entered the Indias, and have thus profaned the\r\nsacred name of God and made the holy gospel odious; and it is by them\r\nthat our holy religion has been dishonored. But now that his Majesty\r\nknows what excesses have been committed in these islands, he should\r\norder that henceforth they shall cease, and that in the promulgation of\r\nthe holy gospel the instructions and rules be observed which our Lord\r\nJesus Christ ordained, and which His holy evangelical law directs and\r\ncommands, and which the holy apostles and the apostolic men who came\r\nafter them practiced and observed until our wretched times. Since the\r\nSpaniards entered the Indias, their excessive cupidity has devised\r\nnew methods of preaching the gospel such as our Lord Jesus Christ\r\nnever ordained, or His holy apostles knew; they are not permitted by\r\nthe law of nature, nor do they agree with reason.\r\n\r\nI shall send the proofs of these conclusions to your Lordship as soon\r\nas my occupations give me opportunity and leisure to prove them. At\r\nManila, on the eighteenth of January, 1591.\r\n\r\n_The Bishop of the Filipinas_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from the Bishop of the Philipinas to the Governor\r\n\r\n_Jesus_\r\n\r\nIn the document which I sent to your Lordship the other day was\r\ncontained the substance of the opinion which I and other theologians\r\nof this bishopric hold concerning the collection [of tributes] from\r\nthe encomiendas in these islands. I then stated that all the matter\r\noutlined therein would be sent later to your Lordship, proved in detail\r\nby convincing arguments. This, however, I have not been able to do,\r\nnor will it be possible as long as I must remain in this city; for day\r\nand night I am beset by necessary business. For this reason, I would be\r\nglad to be able to leave the city for a few days in order that I might\r\nconclude this matter--to which, since it is to be brought before his\r\nMajesty and his royal Council, persons who are to consider it with\r\ncare, it would seem but right that I should also give most careful\r\nattention. And yet the truth of all that I say is so manifest that I\r\nwould be put to little trouble if I were compelled to prove it; but\r\nconsiderable time would be necessary to put it in order. Having sent\r\nthe aforesaid opinion to your Lordship, I ceased to concern myself\r\nabout the matter, for it seemed to me that the document contained\r\n(although in outline) all that the truth required, and all that I\r\nhad to say thereon. Accordingly, what remains for me to set down will\r\nnot be an addition to the aforesaid, but merely an effort to explain\r\nit further, and to prove by arguments and authority what has already\r\nbeen stated in brief.\r\n\r\nThe dean informed me this morning that your Lordship was awaiting my\r\nopinion, and had suspended action until I should send it. I told him\r\nthat, as far as I was concerned, I had already given it--that is to\r\nsay, I had told your Lordship how I, as well as the other theologians,\r\nand right-thinking persons of this bishopric, felt in this matter. It\r\nis true, I did not send, as soon as I might, what remained to be said;\r\nbut that, after all, matters but little for the truth of the affair. As\r\nI stated in the opinion which your Lordship has in your possession,\r\nall that I might afterward say is contained therein. However, in\r\norder that your Lordship may have a clearer statement of what I sent\r\nin that document, and of all else that I have to say, it has seemed\r\nexpedient to send to your Lordship another paper, which accompanies\r\nthis letter; therein are contained twenty-five conclusions, in\r\nwhich there is a summary of all that may be said in relation to the\r\nencomenderos of these islands, concerning both the collection of the\r\ntributes, and the obligations of the encomenderos towards the Indians\r\nof their encomiendas. Further, I have stated therein the duties of\r\nthe governors in respect to their treatment of the Indians and the\r\ncollection of tributes. I thought it best to state those conclusions\r\nin the same order as before, since I shall place them in that order\r\nin proving them.\r\n\r\nI fully realize that for those who are accustomed to collect tributes\r\nwith no other care for the Indians of their encomiendas than to\r\nobtain their money and then leave them to bear their afflictions,\r\nthose conclusions must of necessity appear very severe; but, although\r\nthe truth always hurts those whom it chastises, it should not on\r\nthat account be suppressed--for, as St. Gregory says, one should not\r\nbe hindered by any obstacle whatever from uttering the truth. The\r\ndifficulty of this affair, moreover, does not consist in knowing what\r\nthe truth is (for that is perfectly evident); but in the fact that\r\nunrighteous custom favors the powerful, and is hostile to those who,\r\nalthough they can do little, are unwilling to submit to what those who\r\nare in power choose to command. But the weak have given thanks to God,\r\nwho has moved the heart of our most Christian king to order that a\r\nremedy be applied to so many and so great disorders and excesses, which\r\nup to the present time have been so contrary to natural law, and proved\r\nso great an impediment to religion and evangelical preaching, and so\r\nharmful and prejudicial to the inhabitants of these islands. Indeed,\r\nif we should hear, as God does, the complaints and outcries which\r\ncontinually arise in the hearts of these people, we would clearly see\r\nhow much more cause there is for comforting them than for favoring\r\nthose who have inflicted upon them such injury. And yet, if we but\r\nconsider this carefully, we shall see that the Spaniards have done\r\nthemselves still greater harm, since they have deprived the Indians\r\nmerely of their property, but have incurred the condemnation of their\r\nown souls.\r\n\r\nI, my Lord, do not wish, nor do I pretend, that the encomenderos\r\nshould die of hunger, or that your Lordship should lack the means to\r\nfulfil your obligations; but I do maintain that we should have such\r\ncare for what is right for the Spaniards as not to sicken more souls,\r\nor cause the gospel to be received in this land not gladly, but by\r\nforce, and in such wise that it will not avail those who receive it.\r\n\r\nThe king, our lord, need only decree that this matter be left to the\r\nconscience of those who govern here; for his Majesty cannot examine\r\nit with his own eyes, and, consequently, the entire burden falls upon\r\nyour Lordship and upon those of us who have to decide what shall be\r\ndone. This affair is not one of so little risk as not to require a\r\nmost careful consideration; for to deprive the Spaniards of the right\r\nof collecting the tributes from their encomiendas, when they might\r\njust as well do so, is to deprive them of their very property, and\r\ngive them permission to collect from those who do not owe tribute,\r\nand to free them from obligation to the Indians. Thus the entire\r\nresponsibility would fall upon those who might express their opinion;\r\nconsequently, it has been necessary, as I have already said, to\r\nconsider the matter most carefully. This I have done by consulting\r\npersons who know and thoroughly understand the point at issue; and\r\nby comparing therewith what I have seen and know from experience,\r\nand from my knowledge of the law.\r\n\r\nSuch are the contents of the conclusions which I herewith send your\r\nLordship. I trust that you will be pleased to read them and will expect\r\nfrom me no other opinion than the one therein contained; for I have,\r\nand shall have, no other, and there is not a right-minded person in\r\nthe bishopric who dares maintain the contrary.\r\n\r\nTwo points should be especially noted among those which I here\r\nset down. The one concerns the second conclusion wherein I make the\r\nfollowing statement: From the small encomiendas may be collected half\r\nof the tributes even where there is no instruction, if the encomendero\r\nfulfils his duties; and from those of average size a third part of\r\nthe same. Although there is, in strictness, no reason why one-half\r\nshould be collected from the small encomiendas and only a third part\r\nfrom the others, yet after careful consideration, it has seemed to\r\nus both equitable and reasonable that, in a very small encomienda,\r\nthe encomendero should collect from each inhabitant somewhat more\r\nfor his maintenance than if the inhabitants were numerous and thus\r\ncould provide, even when a less sum was levied, better support for\r\nthe encomendero.\r\n\r\nThe other matter for consideration relates to the statements in the\r\nthird and fourth conclusions concerning the restitution of what has\r\nthus far been taken from the natives. In this matter some moderation\r\nshould be displayed, in view of the present needy condition of the\r\nencomenderos. This subject, however, will be discussed later, and\r\nthe best possible arrangement will be made for assuring the peace\r\nof consciences, which we who are here strive to do. It is, too, no\r\nsmall grace to your Lordship, that this matter should be considered\r\nin your time. I can assure your Lordship that there has been much\r\ncriticism concerning what past governors have permitted, and I do not\r\nknow how in the end they are to fare with God; for a governor, from\r\nthe very character of his office, is under obligation to prevent,\r\nwithin his jurisdiction, evils which can be remedied. God will\r\nknow how to call to account those who have permitted these abuses,\r\nand will free your Lordship from these difficulties before they have\r\nentangled you. Your Lordship indeed owes much gratitude to God, for,\r\nwhether or not the encomenderos make any collection, nothing will be\r\ncast into your purse without your experiencing much scruple at not\r\nhaving remedied the evil. God knows the scruples and anguish which\r\nthe past has caused my soul, for, although it seems that I could have\r\ndone no more than to raise my voice in opposition, and write to his\r\nMajesty, I am not sure that this will avail me with God, who is wont to\r\ndispose of such matters quite otherwise than we imagine; therefore, by\r\ngiving my views upon this question, and by expressing to your Lordship\r\nmy sentiments. I feel myself exonerated in the sight of God and of\r\nmen. Let your Lordship reflect what it is meet to do, for my opinion\r\nhas been already given. May God, our Lord, so enlighten your Lordship\r\nthat in all things you may do what is right. Amen. From this, your\r\nLordship's house, today, Friday, the twenty-fifth of January, 1591.\r\n\r\n_The Bishop of the Filipinas_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor's Reply\r\n\r\nAssuming it to be his Majesty's will that, in the encomiendas where,\r\nfor lack of ministers, instruction is not given, some tribute\r\nshall be collected, if only in recognition of services rendered,\r\nit seems but fitting that enough should be collected to sustain the\r\nencomendero--or, if he should abandon the encomienda, some person\r\nwho should continue, in his stead, intercourse and relations with the\r\nIndians, so influencing and directing them that, when they are given\r\ninstruction, they may receive it willingly; and settling the minds of\r\nthe Indians, so that we can deal with them and travel among them. Such\r\npersons or encomenderos are accessory to the gospel, and should be\r\nsupported, as ministers are, by the tributes of the Indians--who,\r\nif deprived of their presence and left without this intercourse, will\r\ndoubtless become intractable, and a country which is at present secure\r\nand orderly will require a fresh pacification. Accordingly I say that\r\nif your Lordship should order the encomendero to appropriate, for his\r\nown maintenance and for necessary expenses (which are so great, and\r\nthe encomiendas so small), [three--M.] [47] fourths of the tributes,\r\nand if the remaining fourth should [be used--M.] for the erection of a\r\nchurch, for ornaments, and other accessories of religious instruction;\r\nor, if this fourth part should be remitted to the Indians (although,\r\nin reality, if they think that by not becoming Christians less will be\r\nexacted from them, they will never become Christians or admit fathers\r\ninto their territory; and it is certainly better for the Indians to\r\nhave this fourth part held as a deposit for the three years, since at\r\nthe end of that time [they can add--M.] to it a tribute, and assist\r\nin paying the expenses of erecting the church and the costs of other\r\naccessories of instruction and other necessary expenses which may\r\narise); and if the above should be asked from them in advance, and\r\nas a whole--I maintain, that all this could not be exacted without\r\ngreat injury to the Indians.\r\n\r\nThis tribute should be collected with much gentleness toward the\r\nIndians, without the presence of soldiers and firearms, and without\r\nentering their houses. One house should, however, be set apart for\r\nthe purpose of making these collections, where the Indians, summoned\r\nin friendly terms, may come voluntarily to pay their tributes; and\r\nno other force or pressure should be imposed upon them. Moreover,\r\nof the increase of two reals in the tributes, only one (and no more)\r\nshould be exacted, and the aforesaid collection of the three-fourths\r\nshould be general in all the encomiendas. There are no grounds for\r\nmaking a discrimination between the Indian of the large encomienda and\r\nthe Indian of the small one; and if it is right to collect in the one,\r\nthe same procedure holds good in the other, for the same thing applies\r\nto [four--M.] as to forty, which in this case would mean not to change\r\nthe present and past condition of things, or the universal practice\r\nthroughout all the Indias, by interfering with his Majesty's decree.\r\n\r\nWe should consider how little there is in this country besides\r\nthe tributes, for the support of the encomendero or such person\r\nwho has to represent him; and that, if the Indians should cease\r\nto pay the tributes, all would go to destruction; and even were\r\nreligious instruction to exist, there would be no system for applying\r\nit. This instruction, moreover, is not at present in the hands of\r\nthe encomenderos, for they have asked me, as I believe they have your\r\nLordship, to make provision for the same, offering the necessary salary\r\nand expenses. Accordingly, since this charge is not in their hands,\r\nthe above means might be justly employed; so that the districts which\r\nare disaffected might, with such intercourse, be prepared to receive\r\nthe gospel in due time.\r\n\r\nThis plan can be followed temporarily, until information concerning\r\nit shall reach his Majesty--who, I assure your Lordship, will\r\nstraightway adjust the matter by providing these islands, as well as\r\nthose most distant and as yet unpacified, with sufficient religious\r\ninstruction; and by determining what share of the cost shall fall to\r\nthe encomenderos according to the detailed information and report\r\nwhich shall be sent hence to him, together with your Lordship's\r\nstatement. Thus all will come to enjoy the fruits of the gospel,\r\nwhich is our principal end and object with these peoples. In return,\r\nthey are to offer this moderate tribute, which is to facilitate\r\ntheir conversion, to which end everything is directed; and to prepare\r\nthem for it by this means, without which there would be no way for\r\nendeavoring to interest anyone, even if the tribute should amount to\r\nmany millions. But, with this justification, it can be levied.\r\n\r\nThe encomenderos shall maintain their residence, and, as your\r\nLordship justly suggests, shall provide a good example and fair\r\ntreatment toward the Indians of their encomiendas. And, in order\r\nthat the latter may receive (as your Lordship says) some recompense\r\nin return, orders shall be given that all the encomiendas, however\r\nremote they may be, shall be provided with some administration of\r\njustice, with orders to the alcaldes-mayor in whose district these\r\nencomiendas chance to be to visit, at stated periods of the year,\r\nthe Indians thereof. The officials shall then settle the disputes\r\nand redress the grievances of the Indians, bringing them by kind\r\nacts into intercourse and friendship with us. Where the present\r\nnumber of alcaldes-mayor is not large enough, others shall be sent,\r\nin order that thus may be facilitated our intercourse and influence\r\namong them. Under this pretext of administration of justice and of\r\ndefense, at least a sufficient maintenance may be derived.\r\n\r\nLet your Lordship take this matter into careful consideration. For\r\nmy own part, cogent reasons oblige me to believe that, if this plan\r\nbe not carried out, the encomenderos much of necessity abandon their\r\nencomiendas, as has [_illegible in MS._] and no one will be found\r\nwilling to burden himself with this charge and enter into relations\r\nwith the Indians, in return for so small a stipend. Even if there were\r\nsuch persons, we could not place in them the confidence that we now\r\nhave in the encomenderos, in whose virtue and Christian spirit his\r\nMajesty's conscience remains at rest. This would not be so secure in\r\nthe care of substitutes, who replace persons who have abandoned their\r\nholdings, for lack [_illegible in MS._] without much fear of being\r\nobliged to give a bad account of either themselves or the Indians;\r\nand, consequently, instead of introducing our holy faith among them,\r\nwould only irritate the natives by oppression and ill-treatment.\r\n\r\nThis being so, if the encomenderos should abandon their offices, and\r\nno capable persons could be found in their stead, the rule of the\r\nSpaniards would come to an end in this land; for, as they possess\r\nhere nothing beyond the encomiendas as a source of profit and a\r\nrecompense for their services, if they should be deprived of these\r\nI fear that they all would depart from the country and it would be\r\ndepopulated. In such a case, let your Lordship consider which of\r\nthe two evils is the less, and which should be preferred: namely,\r\nthat matters should remain in their present and past condition until\r\nhis Majesty, after thorough information, make suitable provision;\r\nor that, in order to remedy this insignificant evil, we should run\r\nthe risk of ruining and depopulating all the islands. I, my Lord,\r\nhave not the slightest inclination to go to hell merely because the\r\nencomendero collects one or two thousand. After all, whatever your\r\nLordship may consent to, and whatever we resolve to do, must be carried\r\nout, and I must order it to be executed, with the utmost promptness;\r\nfor I understand this to be a matter which concerns the welfare of\r\nmy conscience, wherein his Majesty unburdens his. But at present,\r\nI am thinking only of the difficulties involved in the execution of\r\nthis act, which must be so hard for the encomenderos. When, in the\r\nestablishment and accomplishment of a thing which in itself may be holy\r\nand good, there exist such obstacles that by means of them the whole\r\nis exposed to risk and danger, and the principal [_illegible in MS._],\r\nas your Lordship may discern in the case of the religious fathers,\r\nwho, because they attempted to place the Indians in charge of justice,\r\ndesired them to give up all, and thus there was constraint. Yet they\r\nhad charity and love for them, for otherwise all would be lost. The\r\nsame injury will be inflicted on the encomendero, if we oblige him to\r\nrelinquish the tribute, and give him no other means of support. This\r\nthe king can do, by the decree which is expected.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the very success of the affair admits of no other\r\noutcome than this. For, assuming that his Majesty, to unburden his\r\nown conscience, should commit to your Lordship and to myself the\r\nconduct and decision of what should be done in this matter, and should\r\norder me to execute what we both might determine, and agree upon,\r\nprovided your Lordship should decide that what you have set down in\r\nyour opinion and in your conclusions, ought in conscience to be done;\r\nand if I should find that, although such action is just and right\r\naccording to law, yet in attempting to carry it out it would be in\r\nno wise proper to run the risk of ruining these islands--in this case\r\nyour Lordship and I do not hold the same opinions, and we should report\r\nthis to his Majesty. In the meantime matters will remain as they now\r\nare; and, if resolutions must be adopted, it is much better that we\r\nshould propose them conjointly to his Majesty, with complete harmony\r\nand satisfaction on our part, in order that he may give such orders\r\nas shall seem best to him. In the meantime we should not undertake\r\n[_illegible in MS._] all the more because, considering the affair\r\nin its beginnings, the commission and order of his Majesty--which\r\ninstruct me to see that your Lordship consider what should and can\r\nbe done in this matter; and also to execute the resolutions made\r\nby our joint agreement, with all the punctuality which is required\r\ntherein--clearly express the will and determination of his Majesty,\r\nwho mentions only the encomiendas which are at present disaffected,\r\nor have never been pacified. It is only concerning these latter,\r\nthat doubts may be entertained as to the question of collecting\r\nthe tributes, either in whole or in part (by way of recognition,\r\nas is stated in your opinion). These encomiendas are not reached by\r\nreligious teaching, or by the administration of justice, or by other\r\nadvantages; and, consequently, are the ones concerning which, as I\r\nhave said, doubts are entertained. As for those encomiendas which may\r\npossess any of the aforesaid benefits, such as religious teaching,\r\nthe administration of justice, intercourse, and other advantageous\r\nrelations, there is no occasion for any dispute concerning them; nor\r\nshould the management of these (as far as our present knowledge goes)\r\nbe committed to your Lordship. It is, therefore, needless to include\r\nthem in the general rule; but in dealing with the encomiendas which\r\nare disaffected, and in those not yet pacified, only a part of the\r\ntribute should be collected, for the unburdening of his Majesty's\r\nand our own consciences. Your Lordship's, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Petition Presented to the Governor by the City and the Encomenderos\r\non the Fifteenth of February, 1591\r\n\r\n\r\nWe, the corporation and magistrates of the city of Manila, for\r\nourselves, and in the name of all these Filipinas Islands, and of their\r\nencomenderos, settlers, and discoverers, do declare the following: As\r\nis well known, many of us came here twenty-seven years ago, when these\r\nislands were discovered, and have spent years in the propagation of\r\nour holy Catholic faith, the defense of the preaching of the gospel,\r\nand the service of the king, our lord. On account of this devotion\r\nwe abandoned our fatherland, and forgot our parents, brothers, and\r\nrelatives, and the comforts which each one of us possessed; and after\r\nhaving endured the great dangers of a long and hitherto unknown voyage,\r\nwe settled in a land where we have shed our blood, and suffered the\r\nfearful miseries of hunger, thirst, exposure, and many other hardships,\r\nso great that they have cost the lives of the many thousands of men\r\nwho are known to have come to these islands--not to mention all those\r\nvaliant soldiers who serve his Majesty throughout his realm. At the\r\nconclusion of so many toils and misfortunes--after we had made this\r\ndiscovery, and had pacified and brought under the royal crown the\r\nmany vassals who today are to be found throughout these islands,\r\nand had brought to the bosom of our faith the great number of souls\r\nwho have already received baptism--his Majesty and the governors\r\nin his name have rewarded us by allotting to us a certain number of\r\nnatives. But these grants are under such limitations and the tributes\r\nare so moderate that the most prosperous among us (and there are but\r\nfew) are living in straitened circumstances, and the others do not\r\nreceive the half of what is necessary for their sustenance; many of\r\nthese have no recompense. Although our possessions are so scanty, we\r\nhave been content therewith, inasmuch as we consider them as being a\r\nreward which we have won with our blood and so great labors; for we\r\nare thereby encouraged to serve our Lord and his Majesty--enjoying,\r\nas we do, these tributes and encomiendas in tranquil and peaceable\r\npossession of them, after they have been assigned to us. The king,\r\nour lord, also is profited by those who hold positions in the service\r\nof his royal crown; for they, with the tributes, assist in the great\r\nexpenses which his royal patrimony incurs for the churches, religious\r\norders, and ministers of the evangelical teaching, and for the\r\nsupplies necessary for their maintenance. In this state of affairs it\r\nseems that on the part of the bishop of these islands and some of the\r\nreligious thereof--not only generally, in sermons and in the pulpit,\r\nbut privately, in the confessional--obstacles and difficulties are\r\nimposed upon our consciences by maintaining that we cannot exact the\r\n[_illegible in MS._] his Majesty those which he exacts, and that we\r\nare going straight to hell [_illegible in MS._] and that we are under\r\nobligation to make restitution for them. For this reason they refuse\r\nus the sacraments of absolution and communion; and, finally, they\r\nso obstruct us in the collection of this slender means of livelihood\r\nthat we, and in fact the whole colony, are continually disconsolate\r\nand afflicted, and our consciences disturbed and ill at ease. We know\r\nnot what plan we are to pursue in making these collections; for if we\r\nsubmit to the constraint which the aforesaid bishop and a portion of\r\nthe religious would impose upon us, the necessary result will be that\r\nwe cannot support ourselves, or even live; and his Majesty will be\r\nunable to meet the costs and expenses necessary for the preservation\r\nof the land--although our aim now as always, is to live and die in\r\nthe service of his Majesty like faithful and loyal vassals.\r\n\r\nWe therefore entreat and supplicate your Lordship--inasmuch as the\r\nroyal presence is so distant, and his authority is delegated to\r\nyou in order to preserve us in peace and justice--to decree, in the\r\nname of his Majesty, as the person from whose hand we possess these\r\nencomiendas, that orders and explicit statements be given us as to what\r\nextent and in what manner we are to collect the aforesaid tributes, in\r\norder that with definite knowledge and freedom from misunderstanding,\r\nand without this present trouble and confusion, we may collect them\r\nby virtue of the order which your Lordship may give us to make such\r\ncollections. And so likewise do we entreat your Lordship to command\r\nthat his Majesty be informed as promptly as possible of what your\r\nLordship shall order and decree, so that he may confirm and approve it,\r\nand determine what plan shall be pursued in this matter; and so that\r\nwe may know and abide by it, and thus be delivered from these scruples\r\nand anxieties. In case the above should not be done as we petition,\r\nwe would be deprived of part of the little that we possess; and,\r\nif compelled to make our collections in conformity with the ideas of\r\nthe bishop and some of the religious, we shall not be able to support\r\nourselves. We therefore entreat your Lordship, inasmuch as we do not\r\ndepart from or fail in what we owe to the service of his Majesty as his\r\nloyal vassals, to give us permission to depart for Spain, where we may\r\nserve his Majesty in what he shall command us to do, and where he may\r\nfavor us in proportion to the quality of the services of each one of\r\nus; thus we shall receive grace and justice, which is what we request.\r\n\r\n_Francisco Mereado Dandrade_\r\n_Pedro Davalos y Vargas_\r\n_Juan de Moron_\r\n_Diego de Castillo_\r\n_Juan Pacheco Maldonado_\r\n_Don Francisco de Poca y Pendara_\r\n_Hernan Gomez de Cespedes_\r\n_Don Luis Enriques de Guzman_\r\n_Antonio de Canedo_\r\n_Alonso Garrido de Salcedo_\r\n\r\n\r\n[The remaining documents on tributes are presented partly in full,\r\npartly in synopsis, because of the repetitions and diffuseness which\r\nare frequent therein. Such parts as are thus synopsized will appear\r\nin brackets.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter from Salazar to the Governor\r\n\r\n[Replying (February 8) to the governor's letter, the bishop makes\r\nvarious suggestions. He considers that the responsibility for deciding\r\nquestions connected with the tribute rests upon himself and the\r\ngovernor, and that it is unnecessary and undesirable to refer them\r\nto the king in ordinary cases.] This has been done for the welfare\r\nof these natives, or, to speak more exactly, in order that our holy\r\nfaith may be received in these realms. On account of the many and\r\nglaring instances of lawlessness and disorder, this result is not\r\nyet accomplished in the greater part of these islands; and even\r\nthose who have accepted the faith have received from it very little\r\nbenefit. [Salazar urges the governor to meet this responsibility,\r\nand with him to determine the amount and methods of collection of\r\nthe tributes. He remonstrates with the latter against his intention\r\nof collecting the whole or most of the tributes from the pagan\r\nIndians. Salazar says:] You state that the encomenderos will not\r\ndesire the encomiendas, since they will obtain from them so little\r\nadvantage, but will abandon their holdings; that the Indians will\r\nbecome unmanageable, and it will be necessary to pacify them anew,\r\nin order to have them instructed; and (which would be still worse)\r\nwhen the encomenderos can not be supported it will be necessary to\r\nabandon the country, and the faith will be ruined. This is certainly\r\na very great difficulty, and would be the greatest which could befall\r\nus. But God, who has established here the faith, will not permit it\r\nto be so easily destroyed. Accordingly I maintain, first, that what is\r\nassigned to the encomenderos is not too small to support adequately any\r\none of them whatsoever--not with the opulence and abundance that they\r\ndesire, but as the extreme poverty and wretchedness of the Indians\r\nallows, and as the little that they have accomplished and are doing\r\nrequires. For, if the encomienda be of good size, the encomendero\r\ncan support himself very comfortably with the third part of the\r\ntribute, if it is expended in the same encomienda, where goods are\r\nheld at lower prices; and if the encomienda be small, he may, by way\r\nof equity--although by the letter of the law he should take no more\r\nthan does he who owns a large one--be allowed to collect the half of\r\nthe tribute, since it would seem that he could not support himself\r\nwith less. If they must have more, the encomenderos are not of so\r\npoor standing as not to have other relations and dealings by which\r\nthey can increase their property and help to meet their expenses,\r\nin order that all the burden may not be laid upon the Indians; since\r\neven what they collect from the latter according to law they are not\r\nentitled to, until they pay the Indians what is due them.\r\n\r\n[Salazar goes on to say that there is no danger that the encomiendas\r\nwill be abandoned under this plan; and that the arrangement which he\r\nproposes is for only such time as is necessary to provide adequate\r\nreligious instruction for the natives. Then the full amount of\r\ntribute may be collected, and the encomenderos will enjoy all their\r\nrevenues. Most of them will shirk their obligations to the Indians,\r\nas they have done in the past, unless they are compelled to meet them;\r\nand Salazar thinks that they will be more ready to provide religious\r\ninstruction if they are restricted from collecting the tributes until\r\nthey shall have done so.] He who plants a vine expects to wait until it\r\ncan mature its fruit; it is only with the Indians that the encomenderos\r\nwill not wait until they are prepared to yield fruit, but are ready\r\nat once to cut their throats to make them yield it. And since they\r\nhave thus far collected so many tributes from the Indians without\r\njustification for exacting them, it will be right that henceforth\r\nthey should labor with them, without collecting from them the taxes\r\nso harshly, waiting until the Indians are prepared for having to pay\r\nthe tribute; and the real preparation for this is to strive that they\r\nshall have instruction.\r\n\r\n... For this they deserve some reward, such as the concession made\r\nto them in the second conclusion, which seems sufficient return\r\nfor the little value of all that will be done for the Indians until\r\nthey receive instruction. In order that your Lordship may be fully\r\nconvinced that, even if further limitations should be imposed on the\r\nencomenderos, they need not for that abandon their holdings, your\r\nLordship should remember that, after coming here, you reduced the\r\nsalaries of some alcaldes-mayor, and took away those of some deputies;\r\nand yet they did not cease on that account to discharge their duties\r\ncheerfully, for they can with good conscience take whatever your\r\nLordship shall assign to them. Why, then, should we fear that the\r\nencomenderos will leave their encomiendas, even if they are ordered\r\nto collect no more than the third part of the tributes?... Former\r\ngovernors, as well as your Lordship, have allotted encomiendas,\r\nimposing upon them an annual charge, for a limited period, for\r\nthe benefit of the hospital or of some individual. These were most\r\nwillingly accepted, the owners knowing that when the annual pension\r\nexpired the encomiendas remained to them, which they might freely\r\nenjoy. It is certain, too, that what the encomenderos collected\r\nwhile the pension lasted was not equal to the third part. Why, then,\r\nwill not the encomenderos endure this pension for so short a time, in\r\norder afterward to enjoy the encomiendas freely and with consciences\r\nat ease? for they can do that now.\r\n\r\n[The bishop declares that the conversion of the pagan Indians\r\nwill not be hindered by his plan. Not the least hindrance to the\r\nconversion of these islands is the harshness with which the tributes\r\nare collected from the Indians.] It is certain that when the faith\r\nis preached to the Indians on the plan and with the gentleness which\r\nour Lord ordained, attended with kind treatment and good examples,\r\nin accordance with the requirements of God's law, the infidels will\r\nnever consider whether or not they have to pay tribute. For if they\r\nonce reach a real understanding of what it means to be converted to\r\nGod, and of the benefit which they receive from it, and the evils\r\nfrom which they are set free, not only will they not heed whether or\r\nnot they are paying tribute, but they will, if necessary, surrender\r\ntheir goods and estates, in order not to remain without baptism. We\r\nneed not vex ourselves to secure the baptism of infidels who avoid\r\nbaptism in order not to pay tribute; since it is not such whom God\r\nchooses, or whom the church needs.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty for the Sangleys who sought baptism has been\r\nthe command to cut off their hair. It is certain that on this account\r\nmany have failed to become Christians, whereat I have been exceedingly\r\ngrieved. Not that I have not always wished, and still desire, that\r\nall of that nation might be converted, and I have exerted myself to\r\nthat end with all my strength; but when I see one of them hesitate\r\nas to cutting off his hair, it seems to me that he has not come for\r\nbaptism in the right spirit, and for that reason I do not admit him\r\nto baptism. Those, however, in whose hearts God has moved, and who\r\ntruly understand what they are receiving (and there are many such),\r\nare not disturbed because their hair is cut, or because they are\r\nforever abandoning their native land. On the contrary, these persons\r\nhave broken all ties, and submitted to every requirement, that they\r\nmight not remain without baptism. It is true that we have baptized\r\nsome of that nation without requiring them to cut off their hair,\r\nthrough our reasonable consideration toward them; but we have never\r\nconsented that anyone of them should be baptized until he had made up\r\nhis mind to allow his hair to be cut: and then he did not know that we\r\nintended to baptize him without removing his hair. From the above it\r\nmay be inferred that the payment of little, or much, or none of the\r\ntribute is not in itself a reason for the infidels to avoid baptism;\r\nthey do so because we oppose so many obstacles to the preaching of\r\nthe gospel, and set so bad an example, and because it is so preached\r\nthat they do not understand it.\r\n\r\n[Salazar protests against the notion entertained by the encomenderos\r\nthat \"all their festivities and superfluous expenses should be at the\r\nexpense of the wretched Indians, when they themselves do not fulfil\r\ntheir obligations toward the latter.\" Other persons can support\r\nthemselves without an encomienda; so those who possess such aid can\r\ncertainly do something outside of it to meet their expenses. The method\r\nof collecting the tributes hitherto has been little more than slavery\r\nfor the natives; the bishop pleads in eloquent terms that the governor\r\nwill reform this abuse, and consider the subject from the standpoint\r\nof the Indians as well as from that of the Spaniards.] In order that\r\nthey may endure their hardships cheerfully, it is well that they should\r\nunderstand the change among the Spaniards which has occurred since the\r\ncoming of your Lordship; for their burdens have been lightened by the\r\nreduction of the tributes from the former amount; and the Spaniards\r\nhave done what they did not previously--that is, to treat the natives\r\nwell, and to converse with them in a friendly manner. This, without\r\ndoubt, will greatly incline them toward our holy Christian religion;\r\nand then the Indians cannot make this a matter of complaint against\r\nthe Spaniards, but will keep silence and yield to whatever commands\r\nare given them. [The Spaniards have might on their side, and terrorize\r\nthe weaker natives; but the right only should be considered, and is\r\nmainly on the side of the Indians. The conquerors have brought forward\r\nmany specious arguments to justify their oppression, which for a time\r\ndeceived even the bishop, who expresses his regret and remorse for\r\nhis own mistakes; but his long experience has opened his eyes, and he\r\nespouses the cause of the oppressed Indians, urging the governor to\r\nconsider their needs, without allowing the Spaniards to influence him\r\nin favor of their selfish and unjust practices. Salazar complains that\r\nthe orders of both the king and the governors have been systematically\r\nviolated or ignored; that no one has been punished for infractions\r\nof law save the poor Indians, who often have been justified in these\r\nactions.] But even this has not availed them to escape punishment\r\nin their persons and property. Yet thus far there is no instance\r\nknown when an encontendero or collector has been punished for even\r\nthe grossest acts of injustice and injury which they have inflicted\r\nupon the Indians. And this is the Christian spirit and the justice\r\nwith which we have thus far treated this unfortunate people--we, who\r\ncame hither to bestow upon them a knowledge of God! Notwithstanding\r\nall that, we demand that they shall not dare to move, or to open\r\ntheir lips in complaint. But we have a righteous God, who hears them,\r\nand in His own time will bestow upon each man according to his deserts.\r\n\r\n[The Audiencia had enacted laws favorable to the Indians, which the\r\ngovernor should enforce. For this purpose, it is useless to depend\r\nupon the alcaldes-mayor, since most of them care only for their own\r\ninterests and profit.] On this account the president undertook to\r\nreduce the number of the alcaldes-mayor, and to increase the salaries\r\nof those who were left, in order to remove from them the temptation\r\nto plunder. He also wished to abolish entirely the office of deputy,\r\nas he had already begun to do; this would have been no little benefit\r\nto the country. [The country will only be injured by attempting to\r\nincrease the number of officials; they aid in the oppression of\r\nthe Indians, and care nothing for the bishop's efforts to oppose\r\nthem. If the condition of affairs in Luzon is so bad, what must it\r\nbe in Mindanao, or Xolo, or other remote districts? The Indians can\r\nnot come to the governor with their grievances, and are helpless in\r\nthe power of their oppressors.]\r\n\r\n[Salazar briefly state the opinions given by the religious persons whom\r\nhe has consulted regarding some of the chief points at issue. Most of\r\nthem decide that the third part of the tributes will be enough for\r\nany encomendero, no matter how small his holding may be. As for the\r\nrestitution of tributes unjustly collected, they all conclude that to\r\nrequire the return of all the goods thus acquired by the Spaniards\r\nwould be too severe a penalty for the latter; but that hereafter no\r\nencomendero should be allowed to collect tributes from Indians unless\r\nhe shall provide them with religious instruction, and if he shall\r\nso collect, he shall be compelled to restore to them the goods thus\r\nunjustly obtained. The governor is urgently entreated to investigate\r\nthe manner in which the encomenderos are dealing with the Indians;\r\nto adopt and enforce the orders recommended by the clergy; and to\r\npermit no Spaniard to make collections of tributes unless he fulfil\r\nall obligations due from him to the natives. The same course should\r\nbe pursued in the encomiendas belonging to the royal crown. If the\r\ngovernor will follow this course, the clergy will cooperate with him\r\nby refusing absolution to all who disobey.] From our house, February\r\n8, 1591.\r\n\r\n_Fray Domingo_, Bishop of the Philipinas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinions of the Religious\r\n\r\n[At the request of the governor, the members of the various religious\r\norders furnish him with their opinions regarding the collection of\r\ntributes. The Augustinians thus conclude, in brief: The natives who\r\nenjoy the benefits of Spanish protection, the administration of\r\njustice, and religious instruction, should pay the entire amount\r\nassessed on them as tribute; for it is but just that they should\r\nbear the expenses of these benefits. It was Spain to whom the Holy\r\nSee allotted the work of converting the pagans of the Indias; and,\r\nalthough she has in doing so inflicted many injuries on the natives,\r\nshe has also conferred upon them many benefits in converting and\r\ncivilizing them. If she should abandon the islands great evils\r\nwould result. Even tyrannical treatment does not justify vassals in\r\nrefusing obedience to their rulers--in support of which position many\r\ncitations are made from the Bible and from historical precedents. The\r\nSpanish rulers are accordingly entitled to collect the moderate\r\ntribute which they have imposed on the Indians, if they protect and\r\ninstruct the latter--the condition on which their right to tribute\r\nis based; but all should pay alike, infidels as well as Christians,\r\nwhen they receive alike those benefits. As for the Indians who have\r\nnot been provided with instruction and the protection of law, no\r\ntribute should in any case be demanded from them and whatever has\r\nbeen thus far collected ought to be restored to them in full, as\r\nhaving been unjustly and unrighteously exacted. In the encomiendas\r\nwhich, although once pacified, have since rebelled, a small amount\r\nof tribute should be collected, not to maintain the encomendero,\r\nbut to meet the expenses of restoring order and obedience therein. In\r\nother cases, where the encomendero fulfils his obligations in other\r\nrespects, but fails to provide religious instruction for the natives\r\nthrough lack of ministers, he is entitled to collect only part of\r\nthe tribute designated--that is, what remains after deducting the\r\namount due for the support of ministers (estimated in proportion to\r\nthe number of the people), and for the erection and maintenance of\r\nchurches. In short, the natives should pay only for such benefits as\r\nthey actually receive. The amount to be paid should be based on the\r\namount expended by the government and the encomenderos in providing\r\nthose benefits.] In these islands the number of five hundred Indians\r\n(and in some places even a smaller number) has been assigned to\r\neach minister as sufficient for his charge; and to each minister\r\nof religion has been given a hundred pesos and a hundred fanégas of\r\nrice, all which is worth at least one hundred and twenty-five pesos;\r\nthis is the fourth part of the five hundred pesos which the five\r\nhundred Indians are worth to the encomendero. It is then a fair rate\r\nof taxation, and usually the most exact, to deduct, when religious\r\ninstruction is lacking, the fourth part of the tribute. [If the\r\nencomienda is governed with justice, its holder may in reason collect\r\nthe other three-fourths. The fathers remonstrate against the proposal\r\nto allow the holder of a small encomienda to collect more than he may\r\nwho has a large one, as unjust and dangerous. If the fourth part is\r\nto be withheld from the encomendero, they think that it should be at\r\nonce returned to the natives from whom it was taken. They recommend\r\nthat the governor give orders that the administration of justice be\r\neverywhere established in the encomiendas, and then three-fourths\r\nof the tributes may be collected. For this, however, they advise\r\nthe appointment of deputies directly by the governor, to inspect\r\nthe encomiendas regularly--a duty which will not be satisfactorily\r\nperformed by the present alcaldes-mayor, or by deputies whom they\r\nwould appoint; and these persons should be given adequate salaries,\r\nto obviate the possibility of their defrauding the natives. The\r\npaper is signed by the Augustinian provincial, Juan de Valderrama,\r\nand eleven others of the order.]\r\n\r\n[The Franciscans base their opinion upon the right of the king of\r\nSpain to impose tribute, as derived from the commission given to\r\nthat country by the Holy See for the evangelization of the Indians;\r\nbut this right exists only where the gospel is actually preached. They\r\npartially agree with the Augustinians, but hold a radically different\r\nview as to the amount of collections to be made when the encomendero\r\ndoes not or cannot provide religious instruction, but does protect and\r\ndefend the natives, and set them a good example. For these services,\r\nas tending to prepare the Indians for receiving the true faith, he\r\nmay be entitled to collect one-third of the tributes; but considered\r\nsimply as temporal benefits, they do not give him any right to do\r\nso. Even the administration of justice to the Indians confers upon\r\nhim no right in itself; it does so only as it may aid in or support\r\nthe preaching of the gospel. This opinion is signed by Fray Pedro\r\nBaptista and three of his brethren.]\r\n\r\n[The Jesuits regard both religious instruction and the administration\r\nof justice as just ground for the imposition and collection of\r\ntributes. When the Spaniards take possession of any land without\r\nproviding these benefits, they are only \"establishing divisions of\r\nterritory between the crowns of Castilla and Portugal,\" which has\r\nnothing to do with levying tributes on the natives of such region. In\r\nencomiendas where instruction is not given through lack of ministers,\r\nonly such part of the tribute may be collected as belongs to the\r\nadministration of justice; and the part which would be used for the\r\nsupport of religion must be returned to the natives. The fathers\r\ncite, in support of their opinion, various learned theologians. They\r\nwould permit the encomendero who protects his Indians, but is\r\nunable to maintain religious teaching, to collect means for the\r\nsupport of himself and family--for which purpose they would allow him\r\nthree-fourths of the tributes. The other fourth should be returned to\r\nthe Indians; and, in districts where there is not and will not soon\r\nbe religious instruction, this should be done without telling them\r\nthe reason for such action; otherwise, they will not wish to become\r\nChristians. They urge that definite and prompt action be taken in\r\nregard to this matter. Their opinion is signed by Antonio Sedeño and\r\ntwo other fathers, and is dated February 20.]\r\n\r\n[The Jesuits also send to the bishop a long and learned discussion of\r\nthe question, answering some of the twenty-five \"conclusions\" which\r\nwere adopted by the bishop and clergy (_ante_, p. 276 ff.). Their\r\nposition is the same as that already stated to the governor; but they\r\nmake a more detailed and full statement of their opinions on certain\r\npoints mentioned by the bishop. They think that, in encomiendas where\r\nboth religion and justice are administered, the infidels as well as\r\nthe Christians should pay tribute; for they also are vassals of the\r\nking, and receive from him those benefits, and they alone are to blame\r\nif they do not profit by the instruction placed before them. Where\r\njustice is administered, without instruction, the tributes should\r\nbe collected, after deducting the amount needed for the support of\r\nreligion.] The fundamental reason why your Lordship and we cannot\r\nagree in this matter is, that your Lordship measures it by standards\r\nof sustenance, and we by those of income and just and due tributes;\r\nfor since there are so many Christians here, there is no doubt that\r\nthe king holds these lands by just title, nor can he in conscience\r\nabandon them. [In regard to making restitution to the Indians for\r\ntributes unjustly collected, the Jesuits would exempt from this the\r\ngovernors and royal officials; but it should be required from the\r\nencomenderos. If in these matters, however, the bishop and governor do\r\nnot agree with them, the fathers will support the position taken by\r\nthose authorities. They desire that the latter shall make definite\r\ndecision on such points as can be settled, without unnecessary\r\ndelay. They oppose the bishop's desire to permit the collection of\r\na larger part of the tributes from small encomiendas than from large\r\nones, because this would be not only unjust, but a dangerous precedent\r\nand a source of intolerable confusion and uncertainty. The tributes\r\nshould be considered not as the means of support for the encomendero,\r\nbut as the right and revenue of the king--a consideration which must\r\nshape all conclusions reached upon this subject. The Indians are not\r\nbound to support the encomendero; that is due him for his services\r\nto the king, who gives him the encomienda for this purpose, and for\r\nmeans to carry out the obligations of the king to the Indians. If\r\nfrom this some encomenderos grow rich, that concerns only the king;\r\nit is well that he should have in his colonies powerful men, \"who\r\nare the bone and sinew of commonwealths.\" Besides, the labors and\r\nresponsibilities of these men increase in proportion to the size of\r\ntheir encomiendas; accordingly, they should be duly recompensed. The\r\nservices rendered to the natives by the king and the encomenderos are\r\nenumerated; even those which are secular help to maintain religious\r\ninstruction, and are also more costly than that; they should then\r\nbe well recompensed. The restitution to be made by the encomenderos\r\nis a matter to be decided by the secular rather than the religious\r\nauthorities; and such restitution need be only one-fourth of previous\r\ncollections. A curious piece of information is here furnished:\r\n\"It is known that a priest's district, even if it is not very large,\r\nyields him eight hundred to one thousand pesos; and besides this he\r\nhas fees for burials, marriages, etc. There are reports, and even\r\nnumerous complaints, from both secular and religious sources, that\r\nfor lack of means to pay the fees, many persons do not marry, but\r\nlive in concubinage.\" The Jesuits think that this fee-system is wrong,\r\nand that the priest should be content with his stipend, at least among\r\nthe poor, whether Indians or Spaniards; this applies both to regular\r\nclergy and to friars. The bishop is urged to remedy this abuse.]\r\n\r\n[This is followed by another paper, which discusses minutely,\r\nfrom the standpoint of the logician and theologian, the question of\r\ncollecting tribute from infidels who are not provided with religious\r\ninstruction; it contains abundant citations from the Scriptures and\r\nfrom ecclesiastical writers. As it simply elaborates the opinions they\r\nhave already stated, we do not here present it.] (_To be concluded_.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBibliographical Data\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of 1586-88_.--The text of this document is obtained from\r\n_Cartas de Indias_, pp. 637-652; but the location of the original\r\nMS. is not indicated by the editor of that work.\r\n\r\n_Decree of August 9, 1589_.--This is obtained from the \"Cedulario\r\nIndico\" in the Archivo Historico Nacional, Madrid; its pressmark is:\r\n\"Tomo 7, fº 301, nº 449.\"\r\n\r\n_Customs of the Tagalogs_.--This is one of the appendices to Santa\r\nInés's _Crónica_; see vol. ii, pp. 592-603.\r\n\r\n_The Chinese and the Parián_.--This is translated from Retana's\r\n_Archivo del bibliófilo filipino_, iii, pp. 47-80.\r\n\r\nAll the remaining documents presented in this volume, are obtained\r\nfrom the Archivo general de Indias, Sevilla, and are translated either\r\nfrom the originals or from transcripts thereof; the pressmark of each\r\nis indicated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Letter by Vera_ (1588).--\"Simancas-Secular; Audiencia de Filipinas;\r\ncartas y expedientes del gobernador de Filipinas, vistas en el Consejo;\r\naños 1567 á 1599; est. 67, caj. 6, leg. 6.\"\r\n\r\n2. _Letter by Salazar_ (1588).--\"Simancas-Eclesiastico; Audiencia de\r\nFilipinas; cartas y espedientes del arzobispo de Manila vistos en el\r\nConsejo; años de 1579 á 1599; est. 68, caj. 1, leg. 32.\"\r\n\r\n3. _Letter by viceroy of India_.--\"Simancas-Secular; Audiencia de\r\nFilipinas; cartas y expedientes del presidente y oidores de esta\r\nAudiencia vistos en el Consejo; años 1583 á 1599; est. 67, caj. 6,\r\nleg. 18.\"\r\n\r\n4. _Letter by Vera_ (1589).--The same as No. 3.\r\n\r\n5. _Conspiracy against the Spaniards_.--The same as No. 3.\r\n\r\n6. _Letter by Ayala_.--The same as No. 3.\r\n\r\n7. _Instructions to Dasmariñas_.--\"Simancas-Secular; Audiencia de\r\nFilipinas; registros de oficio y partes; reales ordenes dirigidas a\r\nlas autoridades y particulares del distrito de la Audiencia; años 1568\r\ná 1605; est. 105, caj. 2, leg. 11, lib. i, fol. 171b-195a, part 2.\"\r\n\r\n8. _Letter from Portugal_.--The same as No. 3.\r\n\r\n9. _Grant to Salazar_.--\"Simancas-Audiencia de Filipinas; consultas\r\noriginales correspondientes á dha Audiencia desde el año 1586 á 1636;\r\nest. 67, caj. 6, leg. 1.\"\r\n\r\n10. _Letter by Audiencia_.--The same as No. 3.\r\n\r\n11. _Letter by Salazar_ (1590).--The same as No. 2.\r\n\r\n12. _Decree of July 23_, 1590.--The same as No. 3.\r\n\r\n13. _Collection of tributes_ (1591).--The same as No. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] This document is published in _Cartas de Indias_ (pp. 637-652),\r\nunder the title, \"Letter of petition from the bishop of Manila to the\r\npresident of the Council of the Indias, giving information of the\r\nreligious condition and needs of the Filipinas Islands; December,\r\n1585.\" This date is incorrect, as shown by the internal evidence\r\nof the document itself, and probably arises from some error in\r\nthe transcription from the original; the cabildo's letter was dated\r\nDec. 31, 1586, and the bishop's on June 25, 1588 (incorrectly printed\r\n1585 in _Cartas de Indias_). The allusions in this letter indicate\r\nthat it was addressed to the king, rather than to the president of\r\nthe council.\r\n\r\n[2] Span., _ynsigne é siempre leal ciudad de Manilla_; see the royal\r\ndecree conferring this title, in _Vol_. III, pp. 250, 251.\r\n\r\n[3] Span., _naguatatos_, originally a Mexican word.\r\n\r\n[4] The alcaicería (silk-market) for the Chinese, where their trade\r\nwas exclusively carried on, was at first located on the Pasig River,\r\nopposite Manila, and was established by Peñalosa (1581?). In 1583\r\nit was brought within the city (_Vol_. V, p. 237) by his temporary\r\nsuccessor, Diego Ronquillo, and was generally styled \"the Parián.\" An\r\ninteresting description of it is given by Salazar in a document,\r\ndated 1590, which appears in the present volume, _post_. The Parián was\r\nlong the property of the city; it was destroyed under Governor Basco y\r\nVargas (1778-87), to make room for other edifices, but was rebuilt by\r\nhim in another location; it was finally destroyed in 1860. See Buzeta\r\nand Bravo's _Diccionario_, ii, p. 229; and _Los Chinos en Filipinas_\r\n(Manila, 1886).\r\n\r\n[5] Lake Bombón, or Taal (_Vol_. III, p. 82).\r\n\r\n[6] We here follow the text as given in _Cartas de Indias (dos mill)_;\r\nbut this number, if all the Indians in this province were allotted,\r\nand the number of those in the royal encomienda is correctly given,\r\nshould be seven thousand four hundred.\r\n\r\n[7] In 1579 Gabriel de Ribera, who had been one of Legazpi's officers,\r\nwas sent to conquer Mindanao--an undertaking, however, which was\r\nunsuccessful. Later, he explored the coasts of Borneo and Patan, and\r\nwas afterward sent by Peñalosa to Spain, to render an account of the\r\nconquests thus far made in the Indian archipelago. As a reward for\r\nRibera's services, Felipe II conferred upon him the title of Mariscal\r\nde Bonbon; it is he who is referred to in our text.\r\n\r\n[8] According to _U.S. Philippine Gazetteer_ (pp. 9, 10, 286), there\r\nare now in the province of Ambos Camarines no active volcanoes,\r\nalthough its mountains form a volcanic chain. The peaks of Labo,\r\nColasi, Isarog, and Iriga are extinct volcanoes, their height ranging\r\nfrom 4,000 to 6,450 feet.\r\n\r\n[9] This town was founded by Peñalosa (_Vol_. V, p. 26), and named\r\nfor his native town, Arevalo in Castilla. The former is located a\r\nfew miles west of Iloilo.\r\n\r\n[10] See Candish's own account of this affair in Hakluyt's _Voyages_\r\n(Goldsmid ed.). xvi, pp. 43-45.\r\n\r\n[11] \"The licentiate Palacios, alcalde of court in the Audiencia of\r\nMexico, who in 1581 made official visits to the ports of Guatulco and\r\nAcapulco, where he had charge of the construction of ships intended\r\nfor the Philippine archipelago.\" (_Cartas de Indias_, p. 820.)\r\n\r\n[12] The Portuguese admiral Don Duarte de Meneses--who had been present\r\nin the negotiations between Legazpi and Pereira in 1569 (_Vol_. II,\r\npp. 295, 298, 310)--was viceroy of India from November, 1584 until\r\nhis death, May 15, 1588. He was succeeded in that office by Manuel de\r\nSousa Coutinho, the writer of this letter. See Linschoten's _Voyage_\r\n(Hakluyt Society's trans., London, 1885), pp. 174, 200-203.\r\n\r\n[13] The following table of Chinese weights is given in Clarke's\r\n_Weights, Measures, and Money_ (N.Y., 1888): 10 mace = 1 tael; 16 taels\r\n= 1 catty or kan; 2 catties = 1 yin; 50 yin = 1 pecul or tam. The catty\r\n= 1 1/3 lbs., or 604.8 grammes. Hence the pecul = 133 1/3 lbs. The shik\r\nis a weight of 160 lbs. In China almost everything is sold by weight.\r\n\r\n[14] _Orejeras_ was the name of a fine grade of gold used by the\r\nMalays; see _Vol_. III, p. 224, and IV, p. 99.\r\n\r\nExile thus inflicted was of two kinds. The Spanish phrase here is\r\n_seis años de destierro precisos_--the last word meaning that the\r\nculprit's residence was prescribed in a certain place. In the other\r\nform of exile, read, for _precisos, voluntarios_ (\"at will\"), which\r\nmay be translated \"unconditioned\"--that is, he might choose his place\r\nof residence.\r\n\r\n[15] Span., _corte_; a now obsolete use of the word, to signify a\r\ndistrict of five leagues around the court. It will be remembered that\r\nSande, in 1577, fixed the boundaries of the city of Manila within\r\nthis limit. (See _Vol_. IV, p. 107.)\r\n\r\n[16] As the names of these notaries do not appear on the MS. from\r\nwhich our transcript was made, it was probably one of the duplicate\r\ndespatches sent to Spain, rather than the first and original document.\r\n\r\n[17] Apparently a reference to the law found in _Recop. leyes Indias_\r\n(ed. 1841), lib. viii, tit. xx, ley i, which enumerates the offices\r\nthat may be sold in the Indias. Cf. ley i, tit. xxi, which relates\r\nto the renunciation of such offices after purchase.\r\n\r\n[18] This was a lay brother, Juan Clemente, who came with the first\r\nFranciscan mission. (1577). He devoted himself to the care of the\r\nsick among the natives, and was in charge of a hospital for them\r\n(founded by himself) for many years. For an account of this charity,\r\nsee Santa Inés's _Crónica_, i, pp. 379-392.\r\n\r\n[19] Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas was corregidor of Murcia and Cartagena\r\nin Spain when (in 1589) he was appointed governor of the Philippine\r\nIslands. Arriving there in May, 1590, he at once began the task of\r\nproviding suitable fortifications for Manila, and a body of paid troops\r\nin place of the irregular and unpaid soldiers who had hitherto been the\r\nonly dependence of the Spanish colony. In October, 1593, he formed a\r\nnaval expedition to recover the fortress at Ternate; but on the way\r\nthither he was treacherously slain, with nearly all the Spaniards\r\nin his galley, by the Chinese rowers thereon. See Morga's account\r\nof him in _Sucesos_, cap. v, or in Stanley's translation (Hakluyt\r\nSociety's publications, no. 39), pp. 32-39; also La Concepcion's\r\n_Hist. de Philipinas_, ii, pp. 177-213.\r\n\r\n[20] The proceedings of Sanchez at the Spanish court, and the\r\ndecisions of the government regarding the Philippine colony, are\r\nfully recounted by La Concepción in his _Hist. de Philipinas_,\r\nii, pp. 103-148. Sanchez did not return to the Philippines, being\r\nassigned by the general of his order to various duties in Spain;\r\nhis death occurred not long afterward.\r\n\r\n[21] For account of Sanchez's embassy, and of his instructions, see the\r\n\"Memorial\" adopted by the junta of 1586, with accompanying documents,\r\nin _Vol_. VI.\r\n\r\n[22] Regarding the rates thus levied, see _Vol_. V, pp. 29, 30.\r\n\r\n[23] This last sentence is literally translated from the MS which we\r\nfollow; but there is evidently a defect or error in the text--probably\r\narising from some mistake made by the first copyist, as the MS. is\r\nnot the first original, but a copy made apparently by some government\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n[24] For the text of this decree, see p. 137, _ante_.\r\n\r\n[25] With this document cf., throughout, the \"Relation\" by Miguel de\r\nLoarca, in _Vol_. V of this series.\r\n\r\n[26] Juan de Plasencia, who entered the Franciscan order in early\r\nyouth, came to the Philippine Islands as one of the first missionaries\r\nof that order, in 1577. He was distinguished, in his labors among\r\nthe natives, for gathering the converts into reductions (villages in\r\nwhich they dwelt apart from the heathen, and under the special care\r\nof the missionaries), for establishing numerous primary schools, for\r\nhis linguistic abilities--being one of the first to form a grammar and\r\nvocabulary of the Tagal language--and for the ethnological researches\r\nembodied in the memoir which is presented in our text. He died at\r\nLilio, in the province of La Laguna, in 1590. See account of his life\r\nin Santa Inés's _Crónica_, i, pp. 512-522; and of his writings, _Id_.,\r\nii, pp. 590, 591.\r\n\r\n[27] The betel-nut; see _Vol_. IV, p. 222.\r\n\r\n[28] The Aetas, or Negritos, were the primitive inhabitants\r\nof the Philippine Islands; but their origin is not certainly\r\nknown. It is perhaps most probable that they came from Papua or New\r\nGuinea. For various opinions on this point, see Zúñiga's _Estadismo_\r\n(Retana's ed.), i, pp. 422-429; Delgado's _Historia general_, part i,\r\nlib. iii, cap. i; and _Report_ of U.S. Philippine Commission, 1900,\r\niii, pp. 333-335. Invasions of the islands by Indonesian tribes, of\r\nsuperior strength and culture, drove the Negritos into the forest\r\nand mountain regions of the islands where they dwelt; they still\r\nremain there, in a state of barbarism, but in gradually decreasing\r\nnumbers. See the _Report_ above cited (pp. 347-351), for habitat and\r\nphysical characteristics of this race.\r\n\r\n[29] For much curious and interesting information regarding these\r\nsuperstitions, beliefs in demons, etc., see Blumentritt's \"_Diccionario\r\nmitológico_,\" in Retana's _Archivo_, ii, pp. 345-454.\r\n\r\n[30] This paragraph is a quite literal translation of the clause\r\ntherein mentioned; the latter (in Portuguese) is at the end of the\r\noriginal MS. of this document.\r\n\r\n[31] This was the Cardinal Archduke Albert of Austria, nephew of\r\nFelipe II, who in 1583 appointed Albert viceroy of Portugal. In that\r\npost he remained until 1594, when he was removed to the archiepiscopal\r\nsee of Toledo.\r\n\r\n[32] The above instructions were intended doubtless for this\r\ndocument. They occupy a separate sheet in the collection of documents,\r\nbut their position warrants this inference.\r\n\r\n[33] The first sentence is the official endorsement by the Council;\r\nthe second, evidently that of the king; and the third, that of the\r\nCouncil's secretary.\r\n\r\n[34] The collection of documents of which the above forms a part\r\ncontains a letter from the licentiate Ayala to the king, under date\r\nof June 25, 1590. As in so many letters from royal officials, Ayala\r\nnarrates his devotion to the king's service, and especially in the\r\nPhilippines, whither he had been ordered suddenly from the Canaries,\r\nhis previous post. He begs for a position in Mexico, and means to\r\nreturn to that country. The king orders that one-half his salary be\r\ngiven him.\r\n\r\n[35] At that time, Java was supposed to contain two islands;\r\nthe western part, inhabited by the people of Sunda, was thought\r\nto be separated by a river from the other, forming an entire\r\nisland. Trapobana is a misprint for Taprobana, the ancient name of\r\nSumatra; and Dacheu, for Achen (Achin).\r\n\r\n[36] The cahiz is equal to twelve fanégas, or nearly nineteen and\r\none-fifth bushels.\r\n\r\n[37] Villamanrique was removed from his post in 1589, and in his stead\r\nas viceroy of Nueva España was appointed Luis de Velasco, Conde de\r\nSantiago, a son of the second viceroy; he reached Mexico on Jan. 25,\r\n1590. \"The country made steady progress in every branch of industry\r\nduring Velasco's rule; political, commercial, and social conditions\r\nwere improved, and prosperity prevailed.\" (Bancroft, _Hist. Mexico_,\r\nii, p. 766.) He held the office until 1595, when he was appointed\r\nviceroy of Peru.\r\n\r\n[38] Miguel de Benavides was born about 1550, and came to the\r\nPhilippines as one of the first Dominican missionaries (1587). Soon\r\nafter his return from China, he sailed (1591) for Spain, where he\r\nacted as procurator of his province. Early in 1598, he returned\r\nto the Philippines as bishop of Nueva Segovia; but the archbishop\r\nSantibañez dying in that same year (Aug. 14), he was succeeded by\r\nBenavides. Under his administration was begun the college of Santo\r\nTomás at Manila. He died there July 26, 1605.\r\n\r\n[39] Regarding the numbers of Chinese residents at Manila, see\r\nSalazar's own statement in his account of the Parián (p. 230 _ante_.)\r\n\r\n[40] The English pirate Candish, who plundered the \"Santa Ana.\"\r\n\r\n[41] _Fuerça_: as here used, indicates violence to law, done by\r\necclesiastical judges; _see_ note 46, in _Vol_. V, p. 292.\r\n\r\n[42] Reference is here made to the archbishop of Mexico, who\r\nhad ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Philippines until the\r\narchbishopric was created there. At the time when Salazar's letter\r\nwas written, the see of Mexico had no incumbent, the diocese being\r\ngoverned by the dean and chapter.\r\n\r\n[43] The MS. from which this document was translated is evidently a\r\ncopy of a decree prepared in answer to the request of the citizens of\r\nthe Philippines (see the \"Memorial\" of the general junta, in _Vol_. VI,\r\np. 166 ff.).\r\n\r\n[44] On the back, this document is signed by members of the royal\r\nCouncil of the Indias.\r\n\r\n[45] This statement by the bishop, and the twenty-five \"conclusions\"\r\nwhich follow it are, in the original document from which we copy,\r\nmisplaced in order of time; we therefore restore them to their proper\r\nplace, as indicated by their respective dates.\r\n\r\n[46] Apparently a metaphorical use of the word, a religious _double\r\nentendre_.\r\n\r\n[47] The original MS. is in places torn or illegible; and matter\r\nenclosed in brackets, with the translator's initial, gives his\r\nconjectural readings of lacunæ.",
