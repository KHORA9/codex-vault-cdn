Published March, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorwood Press\r\n\r\nJ.S. Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\r\n\r\nNORWOOD, MASS., U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs things now stand, the course of instruction in American history in\r\nour public schools embraces three distinct treatments of the subject.\r\nThree separate books are used. First, there is the primary book, which\r\nis usually a very condensed narrative with emphasis on biographies and\r\nanecdotes. Second, there is the advanced text for the seventh or eighth\r\ngrade, generally speaking, an expansion of the elementary book by the\r\naddition of forty or fifty thousand words. Finally, there is the high\r\nschool manual. This, too, ordinarily follows the beaten path, giving\r\nfuller accounts of the same events and characters. To put it bluntly, we\r\ndo not assume that our children obtain permanent possessions from their\r\nstudy of history in the lower grades. If mathematicians followed the\r\nsame method, high school texts on algebra and geometry would include the\r\nmultiplication table and fractions.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, a ready answer to the criticism advanced above. It\r\nis that teachers have learned from bitter experience how little history\r\ntheir pupils retain as they pass along the regular route. No teacher of\r\nhistory will deny this. Still it is a standing challenge to existing\r\nmethods of historical instruction. If the study of history cannot be\r\nmade truly progressive like the study of mathematics, science, and\r\nlanguages, then the historians assume a grave responsibility in adding\r\ntheir subject to the already overloaded curriculum. If the successive\r\nhistorical texts are only enlarged editions of the first text--more\r\nfacts, more dates, more words--then history deserves most of the sharp\r\ncriticism which it is receiving from teachers of science, civics, and\r\neconomics.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of affairs we find our justification for offering a\r\nnew high school text in American history. Our first contribution is one\r\nof omission. The time-honored stories of exploration and the\r\nbiographies of heroes are left out. We frankly hold that, if pupils know\r\nlittle or nothing about Columbus, Cortes, Magellan, or Captain John\r\nSmith by the time they reach the high school, it is useless to tell the\r\nsame stories for perhaps the fourth time. It is worse than useless. It\r\nis an offense against the teachers of those subjects that are\r\ndemonstrated to be progressive in character.\r\n\r\nIn the next place we have omitted all descriptions of battles. Our\r\nreasons for this are simple. The strategy of a campaign or of a single\r\nbattle is a highly technical, and usually a highly controversial, matter\r\nabout which experts differ widely. In the field of military and naval\r\noperations most writers and teachers of history are mere novices. To\r\ndispose of Gettysburg or the Wilderness in ten lines or ten pages is\r\nequally absurd to the serious student of military affairs. Any one who\r\ncompares the ordinary textbook account of a single Civil War campaign\r\nwith the account given by Ropes, for instance, will ask for no further\r\ncomment. No youth called upon to serve our country in arms would think\r\nof turning to a high school manual for information about the art of\r\nwarfare. The dramatic scene or episode, so useful in arousing the\r\ninterest of the immature pupil, seems out of place in a book that\r\ndeliberately appeals to boys and girls on the very threshold of life's\r\nserious responsibilities.\r\n\r\nIt is not upon negative features, however, that we rest our case. It is\r\nrather upon constructive features.\r\n\r\n_First._ We have written a topical, not a narrative, history. We have\r\ntried to set forth the important aspects, problems, and movements of\r\neach period, bringing in the narrative rather by way of illustration.\r\n\r\n_Second._ We have emphasized those historical topics which help to\r\nexplain how our nation has come to be what it is to-day.\r\n\r\n_Third._ We have dwelt fully upon the social and economic aspects of our\r\nhistory, especially in relation to the politics of each period.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ We have treated the causes and results of wars, the problems\r\nof financing and sustaining armed forces, rather than military strategy.\r\nThese are the subjects which belong to a history for civilians. These\r\nare matters which civilians can understand--matters which they must\r\nunderstand, if they are to play well their part in war and peace.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ By omitting the period of exploration, we have been able to\r\nenlarge the treatment of our own time. We have given special attention\r\nto the history of those current questions which must form the subject\r\nmatter of sound instruction in citizenship.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._ We have borne in mind that America, with all her unique\r\ncharacteristics, is a part of a general civilization. Accordingly we\r\nhave given diplomacy, foreign affairs, world relations, and the\r\nreciprocal influences of nations their appropriate place.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._ We have deliberately aimed at standards of maturity. The\r\nstudy of a mere narrative calls mainly for the use of the memory. We\r\nhave aimed to stimulate habits of analysis, comparison, association,\r\nreflection, and generalization--habits calculated to enlarge as well as\r\ninform the mind. We have been at great pains to make our text clear,\r\nsimple, and direct; but we have earnestly sought to stretch the\r\nintellects of our readers--to put them upon their mettle. Most of them\r\nwill receive the last of their formal instruction in the high school.\r\nThe world will soon expect maturity from them. Their achievements will\r\ndepend upon the possession of other powers than memory alone. The\r\neffectiveness of their citizenship in our republic will be measured by\r\nthe excellence of their judgment as well as the fullness of their\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n     C.A.B.\r\n     M.R.B.\r\n\r\n     NEW YORK CITY,\r\n     February 8, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=A SMALL LIBRARY IN AMERICAN HISTORY=\r\n\r\n\r\n_=SINGLE VOLUMES:=_\r\n\r\nBASSETT, J.S. _A Short History of the United States_\r\nELSON, H.W. _History of the United States of America_\r\n\r\n\r\n_=SERIES:=_\r\n\r\n\"EPOCHS OF AMERICAN HISTORY,\" EDITED BY A.B.

THE COLONIAL PERIOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT MIGRATION TO AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tide of migration that set in toward the shores of North America\r\nduring the early years of the seventeenth century was but one phase in\r\nthe restless and eternal movement of mankind upon the surface of the\r\nearth. The ancient Greeks flung out their colonies in every direction,\r\nwestward as far as Gaul, across the Mediterranean, and eastward into\r\nAsia Minor, perhaps to the very confines of India. The Romans, supported\r\nby their armies and their government, spread their dominion beyond the\r\nnarrow lands of Italy until it stretched from the heather of Scotland to\r\nthe sands of Arabia. The Teutonic tribes, from their home beyond the\r\nDanube and the Rhine, poured into the empire of the Cæsars and made the\r\nbeginnings of modern Europe. Of this great sweep of races and empires\r\nthe settlement of America was merely a part. And it was, moreover, only\r\none aspect of the expansion which finally carried the peoples, the\r\ninstitutions, and the trade of Europe to the very ends of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn one vital point, it must be noted, American colonization differed\r\nfrom that of the ancients. The Greeks usually carried with them\r\naffection for the government they left behind and sacred fire from the\r\naltar of the parent city; but thousands of the immigrants who came to\r\nAmerica disliked the state and disowned the church of the mother\r\ncountry. They established compacts of government for themselves and set\r\nup altars of their own. They sought not only new soil to till but also\r\npolitical and religious liberty for themselves and their children.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AGENCIES OF AMERICAN COLONIZATION\r\n\r\nIt was no light matter for the English to cross three thousand miles of\r\nwater and found homes in the American wilderness at the opening of the\r\nseventeenth century. Ships, tools, and supplies called for huge outlays\r\nof money. Stores had to be furnished in quantities sufficient to sustain\r\nthe life of the settlers until they could gather harvests of their own.\r\nArtisans and laborers of skill and industry had to be induced to risk\r\nthe hazards of the new world. Soldiers were required for defense and\r\nmariners for the exploration of inland waters. Leaders of good judgment,\r\nadept in managing men, had to be discovered. Altogether such an\r\nenterprise demanded capital larger than the ordinary merchant or\r\ngentleman could amass and involved risks more imminent than he dared to\r\nassume. Though in later days, after initial tests had been made, wealthy\r\nproprietors were able to establish colonies on their own account, it was\r\nthe corporation that furnished the capital and leadership in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\n=The Trading Company.=--English pioneers in exploration found an\r\ninstrument for colonization in companies of merchant adventurers, which\r\nhad long been employed in carrying on commerce with foreign countries.\r\nSuch a corporation was composed of many persons of different ranks of\r\nsociety--noblemen, merchants, and gentlemen--who banded together for a\r\nparticular undertaking, each contributing a sum of money and sharing in\r\nthe profits of the venture. It was organized under royal authority; it\r\nreceived its charter, its grant of land, and its trading privileges from\r\nthe king and carried on its operations under his supervision and\r\ncontrol. The charter named all the persons originally included in the\r\ncorporation and gave them certain powers in the management of its\r\naffairs, including the right to admit new members. The company was in\r\nfact a little government set up by the king. When the members of the\r\ncorporation remained in England, as in the case of the Virginia Company,\r\nthey operated through agents sent to the colony. When they came over the\r\nseas themselves and settled in America, as in the case of Massachusetts,\r\nthey became the direct government of the country they possessed. The\r\nstockholders in that instance became the voters and the governor, the\r\nchief magistrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN WINTHROP, GOVERNOR OF THE MASSACHUSETTS BAY\r\nCOMPANY]\r\n\r\nFour of the thirteen colonies in America owed their origins to the\r\ntrading corporation. It was the London Company, created by King James I,\r\nin 1606, that laid during the following year the foundations of Virginia\r\nat Jamestown. It was under the auspices of their West India Company,\r\nchartered in 1621, that the Dutch planted the settlements of the New\r\nNetherland in the valley of the Hudson. The founders of Massachusetts\r\nwere Puritan leaders and men of affairs whom King Charles I incorporated\r\nin 1629 under the title: \"The governor and company of the Massachusetts\r\nBay in New England.\" In this case the law did but incorporate a group\r\ndrawn together by religious ties. \"We must be knit together as one man,\"\r\nwrote John Winthrop, the first Puritan governor in America. Far to the\r\nsouth, on the banks of the Delaware River, a Swedish commercial company\r\nin 1638 made the beginnings of a settlement, christened New Sweden; it\r\nwas destined to pass under the rule of the Dutch, and finally under the\r\nrule of William Penn as the proprietary colony of Delaware.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, Georgia may be included among the \"company\r\ncolonies.\" It was, however, originally conceived by the moving spirit,\r\nJames Oglethorpe, as an asylum for poor men, especially those imprisoned\r\nfor debt. To realize this humane purpose, he secured from King George\r\nII, in 1732, a royal charter uniting several gentlemen, including\r\nhimself, into \"one body politic and corporate,\" known as the \"Trustees\r\nfor establishing the colony of Georgia in America.\" In the structure of\r\ntheir organization and their methods of government, the trustees did not\r\ndiffer materially from the regular companies created for trade and\r\ncolonization. Though their purposes were benevolent, their transactions\r\nhad to be under the forms of law and according to the rules of business.\r\n\r\n=The Religious Congregation.=--A second agency which figured largely in\r\nthe settlement of America was the religious brotherhood, or\r\ncongregation, of men and women brought together in the bonds of a common\r\nreligious faith. By one of the strange fortunes of history, this\r\ninstitution, founded in the early days of Christianity, proved to be a\r\npotent force in the origin and growth of self-government in a land far\r\naway from Galilee. \"And the multitude of them that believed were of one\r\nheart and of one soul,\" we are told in the Acts describing the Church at\r\nJerusalem. \"We are knit together as a body in a most sacred covenant of\r\nthe Lord ... by virtue of which we hold ourselves strictly tied to all\r\ncare of each other's good and of the whole,\" wrote John Robinson, a\r\nleader among the Pilgrims who founded their tiny colony of Plymouth in\r\n1620. The Mayflower Compact, so famous in American history, was but a\r\nwritten and signed agreement, incorporating the spirit of obedience to\r\nthe common good, which served as a guide to self-government until\r\nPlymouth was annexed to Massachusetts in 1691.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL GRANTS]\r\n\r\nThree other colonies, all of which retained their identity until the eve\r\nof the American Revolution, likewise sprang directly from the\r\ncongregations of the faithful: Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New\r\nHampshire, mainly offshoots from Massachusetts. They were founded by\r\nsmall bodies of men and women, \"united in solemn covenants with the\r\nLord,\" who planted their settlements in the wilderness. Not until many a\r\nyear after Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson conducted their followers\r\nto the Narragansett country was Rhode Island granted a charter of\r\nincorporation (1663) by the crown. Not until long after the congregation\r\nof Thomas Hooker from Newtown blazed the way into the Connecticut River\r\nValley did the king of England give Connecticut a charter of its own\r\n(1662) and a place among the colonies. Half a century elapsed before the\r\ntowns laid out beyond the Merrimac River by emigrants from Massachusetts\r\nwere formed into the royal province of New Hampshire in 1679.\r\n\r\nEven when Connecticut was chartered, the parchment and sealing wax of\r\nthe royal lawyers did but confirm rights and habits of self-government\r\nand obedience to law previously established by the congregations. The\r\ntowns of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield had long lived happily\r\nunder their \"Fundamental Orders\" drawn up by themselves in 1639; so had\r\nthe settlers dwelt peacefully at New Haven under their \"Fundamental\r\nArticles\" drafted in the same year. The pioneers on the Connecticut\r\nshore had no difficulty in agreeing that \"the Scriptures do hold forth a\r\nperfect rule for the direction and government of all men.\"\r\n\r\n=The Proprietor.=--A third and very important colonial agency was the\r\nproprietor, or proprietary. As the name, associated with the word\r\n\"property,\" implies, the proprietor was a person to whom the king\r\ngranted property in lands in North America to have, hold, use, and enjoy\r\nfor his own benefit and profit, with the right to hand the estate down\r\nto his heirs in perpetual succession. The proprietor was a rich and\r\npowerful person, prepared to furnish or secure the capital, collect the\r\nships, supply the stores, and assemble the settlers necessary to found\r\nand sustain a plantation beyond the seas. Sometimes the proprietor\r\nworked alone. Sometimes two or more were associated like partners in the\r\ncommon undertaking.\r\n\r\nFive colonies, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the Carolinas,\r\nowe their formal origins, though not always their first settlements, nor\r\nin most cases their prosperity, to the proprietary system. Maryland,\r\nestablished in 1634 under a Catholic nobleman, Lord Baltimore, and\r\nblessed with religious toleration by the act of 1649, flourished under\r\nthe mild rule of proprietors until it became a state in the American\r\nunion. New Jersey, beginning its career under two proprietors, Berkeley\r\nand Carteret, in 1664, passed under the direct government of the crown\r\nin 1702. Pennsylvania was, in a very large measure, the product of the\r\ngenerous spirit and tireless labors of its first proprietor, the leader\r\nof the Friends, William Penn, to whom it was granted in 1681 and in\r\nwhose family it remained until 1776. The two Carolinas were first\r\norganized as one colony in 1663 under the government and patronage of\r\neight proprietors, including Lord Clarendon; but after more than half a\r\ncentury both became royal provinces governed by the king.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PENN, PROPRIETOR OF PENNSYLVANIA]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIAL PEOPLES\r\n\r\n=The English.=--In leadership and origin the thirteen colonies, except\r\nNew York and Delaware, were English. During the early days of all, save\r\nthese two, the main, if not the sole, current of immigration was from\r\nEngland. The colonists came from every walk of life. They were men,\r\nwomen, and children of \"all sorts and conditions.\" The major portion\r\nwere yeomen, or small land owners, farm laborers, and artisans. With\r\nthem were merchants and gentlemen who brought their stocks of goods or\r\ntheir fortunes to the New World. Scholars came from Oxford and\r\nCambridge to preach the gospel or to teach. Now and then the son of an\r\nEnglish nobleman left his baronial hall behind and cast his lot with\r\nAmerica. The people represented every religious faith--members of the\r\nEstablished Church of England; Puritans who had labored to reform that\r\nchurch; Separatists, Baptists, and Friends, who had left it altogether;\r\nand Catholics, who clung to the religion of their fathers.\r\n\r\nNew England was almost purely English. During the years between 1629 and\r\n1640, the period of arbitrary Stuart government, about twenty thousand\r\nPuritans emigrated to America, settling in the colonies of the far\r\nNorth. Although minor additions were made from time to time, the greater\r\nportion of the New England people sprang from this original stock.\r\nVirginia, too, for a long time drew nearly all her immigrants from\r\nEngland alone. Not until the eve of the Revolution did other\r\nnationalities, mainly the Scotch-Irish and Germans, rival the English in\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe populations of later English colonies--the Carolinas, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Georgia--while receiving a steady stream of\r\nimmigration from England, were constantly augmented by wanderers from\r\nthe older settlements. New York was invaded by Puritans from New England\r\nin such numbers as to cause the Anglican clergymen there to lament that\r\n\"free thinking spreads almost as fast as the Church.\" North Carolina was\r\nfirst settled toward the northern border by immigrants from Virginia.\r\nSome of the North Carolinians, particularly the Quakers, came all the\r\nway from New England, tarrying in Virginia only long enough to learn how\r\nlittle they were wanted in that Anglican colony.\r\n\r\n=The Scotch-Irish.=--Next to the English in numbers and influence were\r\nthe Scotch-Irish, Presbyterians in belief, English in tongue. Both\r\nreligious and economic reasons sent them across the sea. Their Scotch\r\nancestors, in the days of Cromwell, had settled in the north of Ireland\r\nwhence the native Irish had been driven by the conqueror's sword. There\r\nthe Scotch nourished for many years enjoying in peace their own form of\r\nreligion and growing prosperous in the manufacture of fine linen and\r\nwoolen cloth. Then the blow fell. Toward the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury their religious worship was put under the ban and the export of\r\ntheir cloth was forbidden by the English Parliament. Within two decades\r\ntwenty thousand Scotch-Irish left Ulster alone, for America; and all\r\nduring the eighteenth century the migration continued to be heavy.\r\nAlthough no exact record was kept, it is reckoned that the Scotch-Irish\r\nand the Scotch who came directly from Scotland, composed one-sixth of\r\nthe entire American population on the eve of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SETTLEMENTS OF GERMAN AND SCOTCH-IRISH\r\nIMMIGRANTS]\r\n\r\nThese newcomers in America made their homes chiefly in New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas. Coming late upon\r\nthe scene, they found much of the land immediately upon the seaboard\r\nalready taken up. For this reason most of them became frontier people\r\nsettling the interior and upland regions. There they cleared the land,\r\nlaid out their small farms, and worked as \"sturdy yeomen on the soil,\"\r\nhardy, industrious, and independent in spirit, sharing neither the\r\nluxuries of the rich planters nor the easy life of the leisurely\r\nmerchants. To their agriculture they added woolen and linen\r\nmanufactures, which, flourishing in the supple fingers of their tireless\r\nwomen, made heavy inroads upon the trade of the English merchants in\r\nthe colonies. Of their labors a poet has sung:\r\n\r\n        \"O, willing hands to toil;\r\n    Strong natures tuned to the harvest-song and bound to the kindly soil;\r\n    Bold pioneers for the wilderness, defenders in the field.\"\r\n\r\n=The Germans.=--Third among the colonists in order of numerical\r\nimportance were the Germans. From the very beginning, they appeared in\r\ncolonial records. A number of the artisans and carpenters in the first\r\nJamestown colony were of German descent. Peter Minuit, the famous\r\ngovernor of New Motherland, was a German from Wesel on the Rhine, and\r\nJacob Leisler, leader of a popular uprising against the provincial\r\nadministration of New York, was a German from Frankfort-on-Main. The\r\nwholesale migration of Germans began with the founding of Pennsylvania.\r\nPenn was diligent in searching for thrifty farmers to cultivate his\r\nlands and he made a special effort to attract peasants from the Rhine\r\ncountry. A great association, known as the Frankfort Company, bought\r\nmore than twenty thousand acres from him and in 1684 established a\r\ncenter at Germantown for the distribution of German immigrants. In old\r\nNew York, Rhinebeck-on-the-Hudson became a similar center for\r\ndistribution. All the way from Maine to Georgia inducements were offered\r\nto the German farmers and in nearly every colony were to be found, in\r\ntime, German settlements. In fact the migration became so large that\r\nGerman princes were frightened at the loss of so many subjects and\r\nEngland was alarmed by the influx of foreigners into her overseas\r\ndominions. Yet nothing could stop the movement. By the end of the\r\ncolonial period, the number of Germans had risen to more than two\r\nhundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThe majority of them were Protestants from the Rhine region, and South\r\nGermany. Wars, religious controversies, oppression, and poverty drove\r\nthem forth to America. Though most of them were farmers, there were also\r\namong them skilled artisans who contributed to the rapid growth of\r\nindustries in Pennsylvania. Their iron, glass, paper, and woolen mills,\r\ndotted here and there among the thickly settled regions, added to the\r\nwealth and independence of the province.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE OF OLD GERMANTOWN]\r\n\r\nUnlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans did not speak the language of the\r\noriginal colonists or mingle freely with them. They kept to themselves,\r\nbuilt their own schools, founded their own newspapers, and published\r\ntheir own books. Their clannish habits often irritated their neighbors\r\nand led to occasional agitations against \"foreigners.\" However, no\r\nserious collisions seem to have occurred; and in the days of the\r\nRevolution, German soldiers from Pennsylvania fought in the patriot\r\narmies side by side with soldiers from the English and Scotch-Irish\r\nsections.\r\n\r\n=Other Nationalities.=--Though the English, the Scotch-Irish, and the\r\nGermans made up the bulk of the colonial population, there were other\r\nracial strains as well, varying in numerical importance but contributing\r\ntheir share to colonial life.\r\n\r\nFrom France came the Huguenots fleeing from the decree of the king which\r\ninflicted terrible penalties upon Protestants.\r\n\r\nFrom \"Old Ireland\" came thousands of native Irish, Celtic in race and\r\nCatholic in religion. Like their Scotch-Irish neighbors to the north,\r\nthey revered neither the government nor the church of England imposed\r\nupon them by the sword. How many came we do not know, but shipping\r\nrecords of the colonial period show that boatload after boatload left\r\nthe southern and eastern shores of Ireland for the New World.\r\nUndoubtedly thousands of their passengers were Irish of the native\r\nstock. This surmise is well sustained by the constant appearance of\r\nCeltic names in the records of various colonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:_From an old print_\r\n\r\nOLD DUTCH FORT AND ENGLISH CHURCH NEAR ALBANY]\r\n\r\nThe Jews, then as ever engaged in their age-long battle for religious\r\nand economic toleration, found in the American colonies, not complete\r\nliberty, but certainly more freedom than they enjoyed in England,\r\nFrance, Spain, or Portugal. The English law did not actually recognize\r\ntheir right to live in any of the dominions, but owing to the easy-going\r\nhabits of the Americans they were allowed to filter into the seaboard\r\ntowns. The treatment they received there varied. On one occasion the\r\nmayor and council of New York forbade them to sell by retail and on\r\nanother prohibited the exercise of their religious worship. Newport,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Charleston were more hospitable, and there large\r\nJewish colonies, consisting principally of merchants and their families,\r\nflourished in spite of nominal prohibitions of the law.\r\n\r\nThough the small Swedish colony in Delaware was quickly submerged\r\nbeneath the tide of English migration, the Dutch in New York continued\r\nto hold their own for more than a hundred years after the English\r\nconquest in 1664. At the end of the colonial period over one-half of the\r\n170,000 inhabitants of the province were descendants of the original\r\nDutch--still distinct enough to give a decided cast to the life and\r\nmanners of New York. Many of them clung as tenaciously to their mother\r\ntongue as they did to their capacious farmhouses or their Dutch ovens;\r\nbut they were slowly losing their identity as the English pressed in\r\nbeside them to farm and trade.\r\n\r\nThe melting pot had begun its historic mission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF COLONIZATION\r\n\r\nConsidered from one side, colonization, whatever the motives of the\r\nemigrants, was an economic matter. It involved the use of capital to pay\r\nfor their passage, to sustain them on the voyage, and to start them on\r\nthe way of production. Under this stern economic necessity, Puritans,\r\nScotch-Irish, Germans, and all were alike laid.\r\n\r\n=Immigrants Who Paid Their Own Way.=--Many of the immigrants to America\r\nin colonial days were capitalists themselves, in a small or a large way,\r\nand paid their own passage. What proportion of the colonists were able\r\nto finance their voyage across the sea is a matter of pure conjecture.\r\nUndoubtedly a very considerable number could do so, for we can trace the\r\nfamily fortunes of many early settlers. Henry Cabot Lodge is authority\r\nfor the statement that \"the settlers of New England were drawn from the\r\ncountry gentlemen, small farmers, and yeomanry of the mother\r\ncountry.... Many of the emigrants were men of wealth, as the old lists\r\nshow, and all of them, with few exceptions, were men of property and\r\ngood standing. They did not belong to the classes from which emigration\r\nis usually supplied, for they all had a stake in the country they left\r\nbehind.\" Though it would be interesting to know how accurate this\r\nstatement is or how applicable to the other colonies, no study has as\r\nyet been made to gratify that interest. For the present it is an\r\nunsolved problem just how many of the colonists were able to bear the\r\ncost of their own transfer to the New World.\r\n\r\n=Indentured Servants.=--That at least tens of thousands of immigrants\r\nwere unable to pay for their passage is established beyond the shadow of\r\na doubt by the shipping records that have come down to us. The great\r\nbarrier in the way of the poor who wanted to go to America was the cost\r\nof the sea voyage. To overcome this difficulty a plan was worked out\r\nwhereby shipowners and other persons of means furnished the passage\r\nmoney to immigrants in return for their promise, or bond, to work for a\r\nterm of years to repay the sum advanced. This system was called\r\nindentured servitude.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the number of bond servants exceeded the original\r\ntwenty thousand Puritans, the yeomen, the Virginia gentlemen, and the\r\nHuguenots combined. All the way down the coast from Massachusetts to\r\nGeorgia were to be found in the fields, kitchens, and workshops, men,\r\nwomen, and children serving out terms of bondage generally ranging from\r\nfive to seven years. In the proprietary colonies the proportion of bond\r\nservants was very high. The Baltimores, Penns, Carterets, and other\r\npromoters anxiously sought for workers of every nationality to till\r\ntheir fields, for land without labor was worth no more than land in the\r\nmoon. Hence the gates of the proprietary colonies were flung wide open.\r\nEvery inducement was offered to immigrants in the form of cheap land,\r\nand special efforts were made to increase the population by importing\r\nservants. In Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon to find a master with\r\nfifty bond servants on his estate. It has been estimated that two-thirds\r\nof all the immigrants into Pennsylvania between the opening of the\r\neighteenth century and the outbreak of the Revolution were in bondage.\r\nIn the other Middle colonies the number was doubtless not so large; but\r\nit formed a considerable part of the population.\r\n\r\nThe story of this traffic in white servants is one of the most striking\r\nthings in the history of labor. Bondmen differed from the serfs of the\r\nfeudal age in that they were not bound to the soil but to the master.\r\nThey likewise differed from the negro slaves in that their servitude had\r\na time limit. Still they were subject to many special disabilities. It\r\nwas, for instance, a common practice to impose on them penalties far\r\nheavier than were imposed upon freemen for the same offense. A free\r\ncitizen of Pennsylvania who indulged in horse racing and gambling was\r\nlet off with a fine; a white servant guilty of the same unlawful conduct\r\nwas whipped at the post and fined as well.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary life of the white servant was also severely restricted. A\r\nbondman could not marry without his master's consent; nor engage in\r\ntrade; nor refuse work assigned to him. For an attempt to escape or\r\nindeed for any infraction of the law, the term of service was extended.\r\nThe condition of white bondmen in Virginia, according to Lodge, \"was\r\nlittle better than that of slaves. Loose indentures and harsh laws put\r\nthem at the mercy of their masters.\" It would not be unfair to add that\r\nsuch was their lot in all other colonies. Their fate depended upon the\r\ntemper of their masters.\r\n\r\nCruel as was the system in many ways, it gave thousands of people in the\r\nOld World a chance to reach the New--an opportunity to wrestle with fate\r\nfor freedom and a home of their own. When their weary years of servitude\r\nwere over, if they survived, they might obtain land of their own or\r\nsettle as free mechanics in the towns. For many a bondman the gamble\r\nproved to be a losing venture because he found himself unable to rise\r\nout of the state of poverty and dependence into which his servitude\r\ncarried him. For thousands, on the contrary, bondage proved to be a real\r\navenue to freedom and prosperity. Some of the best citizens of America\r\nhave the blood of indentured servants in their veins.\r\n\r\n=The Transported--Involuntary Servitude.=--In their anxiety to secure\r\nsettlers, the companies and proprietors having colonies in America\r\neither resorted to or connived at the practice of kidnapping men, women,\r\nand children from the streets of English cities. In 1680 it was\r\nofficially estimated that \"ten thousand persons were spirited away\" to\r\nAmerica. Many of the victims of the practice were young children, for\r\nthe traffic in them was highly profitable. Orphans and dependents were\r\nsometimes disposed of in America by relatives unwilling to support them.\r\nIn a single year, 1627, about fifteen hundred children were shipped to\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nIn this gruesome business there lurked many tragedies, and very few\r\nromances. Parents were separated from their children and husbands from\r\ntheir wives. Hundreds of skilled artisans--carpenters, smiths, and\r\nweavers--utterly disappeared as if swallowed up by death. A few thus\r\ndragged off to the New World to be sold into servitude for a term of\r\nfive or seven years later became prosperous and returned home with\r\nfortunes. In one case a young man who was forcibly carried over the sea\r\nlived to make his way back to England and establish his claim to a\r\npeerage.\r\n\r\nAkin to the kidnapped, at least in economic position, were convicts\r\ndeported to the colonies for life in lieu of fines and imprisonment. The\r\nAmericans protested vigorously but ineffectually against this practice.\r\nIndeed, they exaggerated its evils, for many of the \"criminals\" were\r\nonly mild offenders against unduly harsh and cruel laws. A peasant\r\ncaught shooting a rabbit on a lord's estate or a luckless servant girl\r\nwho purloined a pocket handkerchief was branded as a criminal along with\r\nsturdy thieves and incorrigible rascals. Other transported offenders\r\nwere \"political criminals\"; that is, persons who criticized or opposed\r\nthe government. This class included now Irish who revolted against\r\nBritish rule in Ireland; now Cavaliers who championed the king against\r\nthe Puritan revolutionists; Puritans, in turn, dispatched after the\r\nmonarchy was restored; and Scotch and English subjects in general who\r\njoined in political uprisings against the king.\r\n\r\n=The African Slaves.=--Rivaling in numbers, in the course of time, the\r\nindentured servants and whites carried to America against their will\r\nwere the African negroes brought to America and sold into slavery. When\r\nthis form of bondage was first introduced into Virginia in 1619, it was\r\nlooked upon as a temporary necessity to be discarded with the increase\r\nof the white population. Moreover it does not appear that those planters\r\nwho first bought negroes at the auction block intended to establish a\r\nsystem of permanent bondage. Only by a slow process did chattel slavery\r\ntake firm root and become recognized as the leading source of the labor\r\nsupply. In 1650, thirty years after the introduction of slavery, there\r\nwere only three hundred Africans in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe great increase in later years was due in no small measure to the\r\ninordinate zeal for profits that seized slave traders both in Old and in\r\nNew England. Finding it relatively easy to secure negroes in Africa,\r\nthey crowded the Southern ports with their vessels. The English Royal\r\nAfrican Company sent to America annually between 1713 and 1743 from five\r\nto ten thousand slaves. The ship owners of New England were not far\r\nbehind their English brethren in pushing this extraordinary traffic.\r\n\r\nAs the proportion of the negroes to the free white population steadily\r\nrose, and as whole sections were overrun with slaves and slave traders,\r\nthe Southern colonies grew alarmed. In 1710, Virginia sought to curtail\r\nthe importation by placing a duty of £5 on each slave. This effort was\r\nfutile, for the royal governor promptly vetoed it. From time to time\r\nsimilar bills were passed, only to meet with royal disapproval. South\r\nCarolina, in 1760, absolutely prohibited importation; but the measure\r\nwas killed by the British crown. As late as 1772, Virginia, not daunted\r\nby a century of rebuffs, sent to George III a petition in this vein:\r\n\"The importation of slaves into the colonies from the coast of Africa\r\nhath long been considered as a trade of great inhumanity and under its\r\npresent encouragement, we have too much reason to fear, will endanger\r\nthe very existence of Your Majesty's American dominions.... Deeply\r\nimpressed with these sentiments, we most humbly beseech Your Majesty to\r\nremove all those restraints on Your Majesty's governors of this colony\r\nwhich inhibit their assenting to such laws as might check so very\r\npernicious a commerce.\"\r\n\r\nAll such protests were without avail. The negro population grew by leaps\r\nand bounds, until on the eve of the Revolution it amounted to more than\r\nhalf a million. In five states--Maryland, Virginia, the two Carolinas,\r\nand Georgia--the slaves nearly equalled or actually exceeded the whites\r\nin number. In South Carolina they formed almost two-thirds of the\r\npopulation. Even in the Middle colonies of Delaware and Pennsylvania\r\nabout one-fifth of the inhabitants were from Africa. To the North, the\r\nproportion of slaves steadily diminished although chattel servitude was\r\non the same legal footing as in the South. In New York approximately one\r\nin six and in New England one in fifty were negroes, including a few\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\nThe climate, the soil, the commerce, and the industry of the North were\r\nall unfavorable to the growth of a servile population. Still, slavery,\r\nthough sectional, was a part of the national system of economy. Northern\r\nships carried slaves to the Southern colonies and the produce of the\r\nplantations to Europe. \"If the Northern states will consult their\r\ninterest, they will not oppose the increase in slaves which will\r\nincrease the commodities of which they will become the carriers,\" said\r\nJohn Rutledge, of South Carolina, in the convention which framed the\r\nConstitution of the United States. \"What enriches a part enriches the\r\nwhole and the states are the best judges of their particular interest,\"\r\nresponded Oliver Ellsworth, the distinguished spokesman of Connecticut.\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nE.

The feudal and\r\naristocratic societies of Europe were founded on a system of landlordism\r\nwhich was characterized by two distinct features. In the first place,\r\nthe land was nearly all held in great estates, each owned by a single\r\nproprietor. In the second place, every estate was kept intact under the\r\nlaw of primogeniture, which at the death of a lord transferred all his\r\nlanded property to his eldest son. This prevented the subdivision of\r\nestates and the growth of a large body of small farmers or freeholders\r\nowning their own land. It made a form of tenantry or servitude\r\ninevitable for the mass of those who labored on the land. It also\r\nenabled the landlords to maintain themselves in power as a governing\r\nclass and kept the tenants and laborers subject to their economic and\r\npolitical control. If land tenure was so significant in Europe, it was\r\nequally important in the development of America, where practically all\r\nthe first immigrants were forced by circumstances to derive their\r\nlivelihood from the soil.\r\n\r\n=Experiments in Common Tillage.=--In the New World, with its broad\r\nextent of land awaiting the white man's plow, it was impossible to\r\nintroduce in its entirety and over the whole area the system of lords\r\nand tenants that existed across the sea. So it happened that almost\r\nevery kind of experiment in land tenure, from communism to feudalism,\r\nwas tried. In the early days of the Jamestown colony, the land, though\r\nowned by the London Company, was tilled in common by the settlers. No\r\nman had a separate plot of his own. The motto of the community was:\r\n\"Labor and share alike.\" All were supposed to work in the fields and\r\nreceive an equal share of the produce. At Plymouth, the Pilgrims\r\nattempted a similar experiment, laying out the fields in common and\r\ndistributing the joint produce of their labor with rough equality among\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\nIn both colonies the communistic experiments were failures. Angry at the\r\nlazy men in Jamestown who idled their time away and yet expected regular\r\nmeals, Captain John Smith issued a manifesto: \"Everyone that gathereth\r\nnot every day as much as I do, the next day shall be set beyond the\r\nriver and forever banished from the fort and live there or starve.\" Even\r\nthis terrible threat did not bring a change in production. Not until\r\neach man was given a plot of his own to till, not until each gathered\r\nthe fruits of his own labor, did the colony prosper. In Plymouth, where\r\nthe communal experiment lasted for five years, the results were similar\r\nto those in Virginia, and the system was given up for one of separate\r\nfields in which every person could \"set corn for his own particular.\"\r\nSome other New England towns, refusing to profit by the experience of\r\ntheir Plymouth neighbor, also made excursions into common ownership and\r\nlabor, only to abandon the idea and go in for individual ownership of\r\nthe land. \"By degrees it was seen that even the Lord's people could not\r\ncarry the complicated communist legislation into perfect and wholesome\r\npractice.\"\r\n\r\n=Feudal Elements in the Colonies--Quit Rents, Manors, and\r\nPlantations.=--At the other end of the scale were the feudal elements of\r\nland tenure found in the proprietary colonies, in the seaboard regions\r\nof the South, and to some extent in New York. The proprietor was in fact\r\na powerful feudal lord, owning land granted to him by royal charter. He\r\ncould retain any part of it for his personal use or dispose of it all in\r\nlarge or small lots. While he generally kept for himself an estate of\r\nbaronial proportions, it was impossible for him to manage directly any\r\nconsiderable part of the land in his dominion. Consequently he either\r\nsold it in parcels for lump sums or granted it to individuals on\r\ncondition that they make to him an annual payment in money, known as\r\n\"quit rent.\" In Maryland, the proprietor sometimes collected as high as\r\n£9000 (equal to about $500,000 to-day) in a single year from this\r\nsource. In Pennsylvania, the quit rents brought a handsome annual\r\ntribute into the exchequer of the Penn family. In the royal provinces,\r\nthe king of England claimed all revenues collected in this form from the\r\nland, a sum amounting to £19,000 at the time of the Revolution. The quit\r\nrent,--\"really a feudal payment from freeholders,\"--was thus a material\r\nsource of income for the crown as well as for the proprietors. Wherever\r\nit was laid, however, it proved to be a burden, a source of constant\r\nirritation; and it became a formidable item in the long list of\r\ngrievances which led to the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nSomething still more like the feudal system of the Old World appeared in\r\nthe numerous manors or the huge landed estates granted by the crown, the\r\ncompanies, or the proprietors. In the colony of Maryland alone there\r\nwere sixty manors of three thousand acres each, owned by wealthy men and\r\ntilled by tenants holding small plots under certain restrictions of\r\ntenure. In New York also there were many manors of wide extent, most of\r\nwhich originated in the days of the Dutch West India Company, when\r\nextensive concessions were made to patroons to induce them to bring over\r\nsettlers. The Van Rensselaer, the Van Cortlandt, and the Livingston\r\nmanors were so large and populous that each was entitled to send a\r\nrepresentative to the provincial legislature. The tenants on the New\r\nYork manors were in somewhat the same position as serfs on old European\r\nestates. They were bound to pay the owner a rent in money and kind; they\r\nground their grain at his mill; and they were subject to his judicial\r\npower because he held court and meted out justice, in some instances\r\nextending to capital punishment.\r\n\r\nThe manors of New York or Maryland were, however, of slight consequence\r\nas compared with the vast plantations of the Southern seaboard--huge\r\nestates, far wider in expanse than many a European barony and tilled by\r\nslaves more servile than any feudal tenants. It must not be forgotten\r\nthat this system of land tenure became the dominant feature of a large\r\nsection and gave a decided bent to the economic and political life of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUTHERN PLANTATION MANSION]\r\n\r\n=The Small Freehold.=--In the upland regions of the South, however, and\r\nthroughout most of the North, the drift was against all forms of\r\nservitude and tenantry and in the direction of the freehold; that is,\r\nthe small farm owned outright and tilled by the possessor and his\r\nfamily. This was favored by natural circumstances and the spirit of the\r\nimmigrants. For one thing, the abundance of land and the scarcity of\r\nlabor made it impossible for the companies, the proprietors, or the\r\ncrown to develop over the whole continent a network of vast estates. In\r\nmany sections, particularly in New England, the climate, the stony soil,\r\nthe hills, and the narrow valleys conspired to keep the farms within a\r\nmoderate compass. For another thing, the English, Scotch-Irish, and\r\nGerman peasants, even if they had been tenants in the Old World, did not\r\npropose to accept permanent dependency of any kind in the New. If they\r\ncould not get freeholds, they would not settle at all; thus they forced\r\nproprietors and companies to bid for their enterprise by selling land in\r\nsmall lots. So it happened that the freehold of modest proportions\r\nbecame the cherished unit of American farmers. The people who tilled the\r\nfarms were drawn from every quarter of western Europe; but the freehold\r\nsystem gave a uniform cast to their economic and social life in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nA NEW ENGLAND FARMHOUSE]\r\n\r\n=Social Effects of Land Tenure.=--Land tenure and the process of western\r\nsettlement thus developed two distinct types of people engaged in the\r\nsame pursuit--agriculture. They had a common tie in that they both\r\ncultivated the soil and possessed the local interest and independence\r\nwhich arise from that occupation. Their methods and their culture,\r\nhowever, differed widely.\r\n\r\nThe Southern planter, on his broad acres tilled by slaves, resembled the\r\nEnglish landlord on his estates more than he did the colonial farmer who\r\nlabored with his own hands in the fields and forests. He sold his rice\r\nand tobacco in large amounts directly to English factors, who took his\r\nentire crop in exchange for goods and cash. His fine clothes,\r\nsilverware, china, and cutlery he bought in English markets. Loving the\r\nripe old culture of the mother country, he often sent his sons to Oxford\r\nor Cambridge for their education. In short, he depended very largely for\r\nhis prosperity and his enjoyment of life upon close relations with the\r\nOld World. He did not even need market towns in which to buy native\r\ngoods, for they were made on his own plantation by his own artisans who\r\nwere usually gifted slaves.\r\n\r\nThe economic condition of the small farmer was totally different. His\r\ncrops were not big enough to warrant direct connection with English\r\nfactors or the personal maintenance of a corps of artisans. He needed\r\nlocal markets, and they sprang up to meet the need. Smiths, hatters,\r\nweavers, wagon-makers, and potters at neighboring towns supplied him\r\nwith the rough products of their native skill. The finer goods, bought\r\nby the rich planter in England, the small farmer ordinarily could not\r\nbuy. His wants were restricted to staples like tea and sugar, and\r\nbetween him and the European market stood the merchant. His community\r\nwas therefore more self-sufficient than the seaboard line of great\r\nplantations. It was more isolated, more provincial, more independent,\r\nmore American. The planter faced the Old East. The farmer faced the New\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n=The Westward Movement.=--Yeoman and planter nevertheless were alike in\r\none respect. Their land hunger was never appeased. Each had the eye of\r\nan expert for new and fertile soil; and so, north and south, as soon as\r\na foothold was secured on the Atlantic coast, the current of migration\r\nset in westward, creeping through forests, across rivers, and over\r\nmountains. Many of the later immigrants, in their search for cheap\r\nlands, were compelled to go to the border; but in a large part the path\r\nbreakers to the West were native Americans of the second and third\r\ngenerations. Explorers, fired by curiosity and the lure of the\r\nmysterious unknown, and hunters, fur traders, and squatters, following\r\ntheir own sweet wills, blazed the trail, opening paths and sending back\r\nstories of the new regions they traversed. Then came the regular\r\nsettlers with lawful titles to the lands they had purchased, sometimes\r\nsingly and sometimes in companies.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts, the westward movement is recorded in the founding of\r\nSpringfield in 1636 and Great Barrington in 1725. By the opening of the\r\neighteenth century the pioneers of Connecticut had pushed north and west\r\nuntil their outpost towns adjoined the Hudson Valley settlements. In New\r\nYork, the inland movement was directed by the Hudson River to Albany,\r\nand from that old Dutch center it radiated in every direction,\r\nparticularly westward through the Mohawk Valley. New Jersey was early\r\nfilled to its borders, the beginnings of the present city of New\r\nBrunswick being made in 1681 and those of Trenton in 1685. In\r\nPennsylvania, as in New York, the waterways determined the main lines of\r\nadvance. Pioneers, pushing up through the valley of the Schuylkill,\r\nspread over the fertile lands of Berks and Lancaster counties, laying\r\nout Reading in 1748. Another current of migration was directed by the\r\nSusquehanna, and, in 1726, the first farmhouse was built on the bank\r\nwhere Harrisburg was later founded. Along the southern tier of counties\r\na thin line of settlements stretched westward to Pittsburgh, reaching\r\nthe upper waters of the Ohio while the colony was still under the Penn\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nIn the South the westward march was equally swift. The seaboard was\r\nquickly occupied by large planters and their slaves engaged in the\r\ncultivation of tobacco and rice. The Piedmont Plateau, lying back from\r\nthe coast all the way from Maryland to Georgia, was fed by two streams\r\nof migration, one westward from the sea and the other southward from the\r\nother colonies--Germans from Pennsylvania and Scotch-Irish furnishing\r\nthe main supply. \"By 1770, tide-water Virginia was full to overflowing\r\nand the 'back country' of the Blue Ridge and the Shenandoah was fully\r\noccupied. Even the mountain valleys ... were claimed by sturdy pioneers.\r\nBefore the Declaration of Independence, the oncoming tide of\r\nhome-seekers had reached the crest of the Alleghanies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1790]\r\n\r\nBeyond the mountains pioneers had already ventured, harbingers of an\r\ninvasion that was about to break in upon Kentucky and Tennessee. As\r\nearly as 1769 that mighty Nimrod, Daniel Boone, curious to hunt\r\nbuffaloes, of which he had heard weird reports, passed through the\r\nCumberland Gap and brought back news of a wonderful country awaiting the\r\nplow. A hint was sufficient. Singly, in pairs, and in groups, settlers\r\nfollowed the trail he had blazed. A great land corporation, the\r\nTransylvania Company, emulating the merchant adventurers of earlier\r\ntimes, secured a huge grant of territory and sought profits in quit\r\nrents from lands sold to farmers. By the outbreak of the Revolution\r\nthere were several hundred people in the Kentucky region. Like the older\r\ncolonists, they did not relish quit rents, and their opposition wrecked\r\nthe Transylvania Company. They even carried their protests into the\r\nContinental Congress in 1776, for by that time they were our \"embryo\r\nfourteenth colony.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nThough the labor of the colonists was mainly spent in farming, there was\r\na steady growth in industrial and commercial pursuits. Most of the\r\nstaple industries of to-day, not omitting iron and textiles, have their\r\nbeginnings in colonial times. Manufacturing and trade soon gave rise to\r\ntowns which enjoyed an importance all out of proportion to their\r\nnumbers. The great centers of commerce and finance on the seaboard\r\noriginated in the days when the king of England was \"lord of these\r\ndominions.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOMESTIC INDUSTRY: DIPPING TALLOW CANDLES]\r\n\r\n=Textile Manufacture as a Domestic Industry.=--Colonial women, in\r\naddition to sharing every hardship of pioneering, often the heavy labor\r\nof the open field, developed in the course of time a national industry\r\nwhich was almost exclusively their own. Wool and flax were raised in\r\nabundance in the North and South. \"Every farm house,\" says Coman, the\r\neconomic historian, \"was a workshop where the women spun and wove the\r\nserges, kerseys, and linsey-woolseys which served for the common wear.\"\r\nBy the close of the seventeenth century, New England manufactured cloth\r\nin sufficient quantities to export it to the Southern colonies and to\r\nthe West Indies. As the industry developed, mills were erected for the\r\nmore difficult process of dyeing, weaving, and fulling, but carding and\r\nspinning continued to be done in the home. The Dutch of New Netherland,\r\nthe Swedes of Delaware, and the Scotch-Irish of the interior \"were not\r\none whit behind their Yankee neighbors.\"\r\n\r\nThe importance of this enterprise to British economic life can hardly be\r\noverestimated. For many a century the English had employed their fine\r\nwoolen cloth as the chief staple in a lucrative foreign trade, and the\r\ngovernment had come to look upon it as an object of special interest and\r\nprotection. When the colonies were established, both merchants and\r\nstatesmen naturally expected to maintain a monopoly of increasing value;\r\nbut before long the Americans, instead of buying cloth, especially of\r\nthe coarser varieties, were making it to sell. In the place of\r\ncustomers, here were rivals. In the place of helpless reliance upon\r\nEnglish markets, here was the germ of economic independence.\r\n\r\nIf British merchants had not discovered it in the ordinary course of\r\ntrade, observant officers in the provinces would have conveyed the news\r\nto them. Even in the early years of the eighteenth century the royal\r\ngovernor of New York wrote of the industrious Americans to his home\r\ngovernment: \"The consequence will be that if they can clothe themselves\r\nonce, not only comfortably, but handsomely too, without the help of\r\nEngland, they who already are not very fond of submitting to government\r\nwill soon think of putting in execution designs they have long harboured\r\nin their breasts. This will not seem strange when you consider what sort\r\nof people this country is inhabited by.\"\r\n\r\n=The Iron Industry.=--Almost equally widespread was the art of iron\r\nworking--one of the earliest and most picturesque of colonial\r\nindustries. Lynn, Massachusetts, had a forge and skilled artisans within\r\nfifteen years after the founding of Boston. The smelting of iron began\r\nat New London and New Haven about 1658; in Litchfield county,\r\nConnecticut, a few years later; at Great Barrington, Massachusetts, in\r\n1731; and near by at Lenox some thirty years after that. New Jersey had\r\niron works at Shrewsbury within ten years after the founding of the\r\ncolony in 1665. Iron forges appeared in the valleys of the Delaware and\r\nthe Susquehanna early in the following century, and iron masters then\r\nlaid the foundations of fortunes in a region destined to become one of\r\nthe great iron centers of the world. Virginia began iron working in the\r\nyear that saw the introduction of slavery. Although the industry soon\r\nlapsed, it was renewed and flourished in the eighteenth century.\r\nGovernor Spotswood was called the \"Tubal Cain\" of the Old Dominion\r\nbecause he placed the industry on a firm foundation. Indeed it seems\r\nthat every colony, except Georgia, had its iron foundry. Nails, wire,\r\nmetallic ware, chains, anchors, bar and pig iron were made in large\r\nquantities; and Great Britain, by an act in 1750, encouraged the\r\ncolonists to export rough iron to the British Islands.\r\n\r\n=Shipbuilding.=--Of all the specialized industries in the colonies,\r\nshipbuilding was the most important. The abundance of fir for masts, oak\r\nfor timbers and boards, pitch for tar and turpentine, and hemp for rope\r\nmade the way of the shipbuilder easy. Early in the seventeenth century a\r\nship was built at New Amsterdam, and by the middle of that century\r\nshipyards were scattered along the New England coast at Newburyport,\r\nSalem, New Bedford, Newport, Providence, New London, and New Haven.\r\nYards at Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York built ships for the trade\r\nof that colony with England and the Indies. Wilmington and Philadelphia\r\nsoon entered the race and outdistanced New York, though unable to equal\r\nthe pace set by New England. While Maryland, Virginia, and South\r\nCarolina also built ships, Southern interest was mainly confined to the\r\nlucrative business of producing ship materials: fir, cedar, hemp, and\r\ntar.\r\n\r\n=Fishing.=--The greatest single economic resource of New England outside\r\nof agriculture was the fisheries. This industry, started by hardy\r\nsailors from Europe, long before the landing of the Pilgrims, flourished\r\nunder the indomitable seamanship of the Puritans, who labored with the\r\nnet and the harpoon in almost every quarter of the Atlantic. \"Look,\"\r\nexclaimed Edmund Burke, in the House of Commons, \"at the manner in\r\nwhich the people of New England have of late carried on the whale\r\nfishery. Whilst we follow them among the tumbling mountains of ice and\r\nbehold them penetrating into the deepest frozen recesses of Hudson's Bay\r\nand Davis's Straits, while we are looking for them beneath the arctic\r\ncircle, we hear that they have pierced into the opposite region of polar\r\ncold, that they are at the antipodes and engaged under the frozen\r\nserpent of the south.... Nor is the equinoctial heat more discouraging\r\nto them than the accumulated winter of both poles. We know that, whilst\r\nsome of them draw the line and strike the harpoon on the coast of\r\nAfrica, others run the longitude and pursue their gigantic game along\r\nthe coast of Brazil. No sea but what is vexed by their fisheries. No\r\nclimate that is not witness to their toils. Neither the perseverance of\r\nHolland nor the activity of France nor the dexterous and firm sagacity\r\nof English enterprise ever carried this most perilous mode of hard\r\nindustry to the extent to which it has been pushed by this recent\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of the business was widespread. A large and lucrative\r\nEuropean trade was built upon it. The better quality of the fish caught\r\nfor food was sold in the markets of Spain, Portugal, and Italy, or\r\nexchanged for salt, lemons, and raisins for the American market. The\r\nlower grades of fish were carried to the West Indies for slave\r\nconsumption, and in part traded for sugar and molasses, which furnished\r\nthe raw materials for the thriving rum industry of New England. These\r\nactivities, in turn, stimulated shipbuilding, steadily enlarging the\r\ndemand for fishing and merchant craft of every kind and thus keeping the\r\nshipwrights, calkers, rope makers, and other artisans of the seaport\r\ntowns rushed with work. They also increased trade with the mother\r\ncountry for, out of the cash collected in the fish markets of Europe and\r\nthe West Indies, the colonists paid for English manufactures. So an\r\never-widening circle of American enterprise centered around this single\r\nindustry, the nursery of seamanship and the maritime spirit.\r\n\r\n=Oceanic Commerce and American Merchants.=--All through the eighteenth\r\ncentury, the commerce of the American colonies spread in every direction\r\nuntil it rivaled in the number of people employed, the capital engaged,\r\nand the profits gleaned, the commerce of European nations. A modern\r\nhistorian has said: \"The enterprising merchants of New England developed\r\na network of trade routes that covered well-nigh half the world.\" This\r\ncommerce, destined to be of such significance in the conflict with the\r\nmother country, presented, broadly speaking, two aspects.\r\n\r\nOn the one side, it involved the export of raw materials and\r\nagricultural produce. The Southern colonies produced for shipping,\r\ntobacco, rice, tar, pitch, and pine; the Middle colonies, grain, flour,\r\nfurs, lumber, and salt pork; New England, fish, flour, rum, furs, shoes,\r\nand small articles of manufacture. The variety of products was in fact\r\nastounding. A sarcastic writer, while sneering at the idea of an\r\nAmerican union, once remarked of colonial trade: \"What sort of dish will\r\nyou make? New England will throw in fish and onions. The middle states,\r\nflax-seed and flour. Maryland and Virginia will add tobacco. North\r\nCarolina, pitch, tar, and turpentine. South Carolina, rice and indigo,\r\nand Georgia will sprinkle the whole composition with sawdust. Such an\r\nabsurd jumble will you make if you attempt to form a union among such\r\ndiscordant materials as the thirteen British provinces.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other side, American commerce involved the import trade,\r\nconsisting principally of English and continental manufactures, tea, and\r\n\"India goods.\" Sugar and molasses, brought from the West Indies,\r\nsupplied the flourishing distilleries of Massachusetts, Rhode Island,\r\nand Connecticut. The carriage of slaves from Africa to the Southern\r\ncolonies engaged hundreds of New England's sailors and thousands of\r\npounds of her capital.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of imported goods in the colonies, though in part\r\ncontrolled by English factors located in America, employed also a large\r\nand important body of American merchants like the Willings and Morrises\r\nof Philadelphia; the Amorys, Hancocks, and Faneuils of Boston; and the\r\nLivingstons and Lows of New York. In their zeal and enterprise, they\r\nwere worthy rivals of their English competitors, so celebrated for\r\nworld-wide commercial operations. Though fully aware of the advantages\r\nthey enjoyed in British markets and under the protection of the British\r\nnavy, the American merchants were high-spirited and mettlesome, ready to\r\ncontend with royal officers in order to shield American interests\r\nagainst outside interference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUTCH WEST INDIA WAREHOUSE IN NEW AMSTERDAM\r\n(NEW YORK CITY)]\r\n\r\nMeasured against the immense business of modern times, colonial commerce\r\nseems perhaps trivial. That, however, is not the test of its\r\nsignificance. It must be considered in relation to the growth of English\r\ncolonial trade in its entirety--a relation which can be shown by a few\r\nstartling figures. The whole export trade of England, including that to\r\nthe colonies, was, in 1704, £6,509,000. On the eve of the American\r\nRevolution, namely, in 1772, English exports to the American colonies\r\nalone amounted to £6,024,000; in other words, almost as much as the\r\nwhole foreign business of England two generations before. At the first\r\ndate, colonial trade was but one-twelfth of the English export business;\r\nat the second date, it was considerably more than one-third. In 1704,\r\nPennsylvania bought in English markets goods to the value of £11,459; in\r\n1772 the purchases of the same colony amounted to £507,909. In short,\r\nPennsylvania imports increased fifty times within sixty-eight years,\r\namounting in 1772 to almost the entire export trade of England to the\r\ncolonies at the opening of the century. The American colonies were\r\nindeed a great source of wealth to English merchants.\r\n\r\n=Intercolonial Commerce.=--Although the bad roads of colonial times made\r\noverland transportation difficult and costly, the many rivers and\r\nharbors along the coast favored a lively water-borne trade among the\r\ncolonies. The Connecticut, Hudson, Delaware, and Susquehanna rivers in\r\nthe North and the many smaller rivers in the South made it possible for\r\ngoods to be brought from, and carried to, the interior regions in little\r\nsailing vessels with comparative ease. Sloops laden with manufactures,\r\ndomestic and foreign, collected at some city like Providence, New York,\r\nor Philadelphia, skirted the coasts, visited small ports, and sailed up\r\nthe navigable rivers to trade with local merchants who had for exchange\r\nthe raw materials which they had gathered in from neighboring farms.\r\nLarger ships carried the grain, live stock, cloth, and hardware of New\r\nEngland to the Southern colonies, where they were traded for tobacco,\r\nleather, tar, and ship timber. From the harbors along the Connecticut\r\nshores there were frequent sailings down through Long Island Sound to\r\nMaryland, Virginia, and the distant Carolinas.\r\n\r\n=Growth of Towns.=--In connection with this thriving trade and industry\r\nthere grew up along the coast a number of prosperous commercial centers\r\nwhich were soon reckoned among the first commercial towns of the whole\r\nBritish empire, comparing favorably in numbers and wealth with such\r\nports as Liverpool and Bristol. The statistical records of that time are\r\nmainly guesses; but we know that Philadelphia stood first in size among\r\nthese towns. Serving as the port of entry for Pennsylvania, Delaware,\r\nand western Jersey, it had drawn within its borders, just before the\r\nRevolution, about 25,000 inhabitants. Boston was second in rank, with\r\nsomewhat more than 20,000 people. New York, the \"commercial capital of\r\nConnecticut and old East Jersey,\" was slightly smaller than Boston, but\r\ngrowing at a steady rate. The fourth town in size was Charleston, South\r\nCarolina, with about 10,000 inhabitants. Newport in Rhode Island, a\r\ncenter of rum manufacture and shipping, stood fifth, with a population\r\nof about 7000. Baltimore and Norfolk were counted as \"considerable\r\ntowns.\" In the interior, Hartford in Connecticut, Lancaster and York in\r\nPennsylvania, and Albany in New York, with growing populations and\r\nincreasing trade, gave prophecy of an urban America away from the\r\nseaboard. The other towns were straggling villages. Williamsburg,\r\nVirginia, for example, had about two hundred houses, in which dwelt a\r\ndozen families of the gentry and a few score of tradesmen. Inland county\r\nseats often consisted of nothing more than a log courthouse, a prison,\r\nand one wretched inn to house judges, lawyers, and litigants during the\r\nsessions of the court.\r\n\r\nThe leading towns exercised an influence on colonial opinion all out of\r\nproportion to their population. They were the centers of wealth, for one\r\nthing; of the press and political activity, for another. Merchants and\r\nartisans could readily take concerted action on public questions arising\r\nfrom their commercial operations. The towns were also centers for news,\r\ngossip, religious controversy, and political discussion. In the market\r\nplaces the farmers from the countryside learned of British policies and\r\nlaws, and so, mingling with the townsmen, were drawn into the main\r\ncurrents of opinion which set in toward colonial nationalism and\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nJ.

There was\r\nlittle money in private purses or public treasuries to be dedicated to\r\nschools, libraries, and museums. Few there were with time to read long\r\nand widely, and fewer still who could devote their lives to things that\r\ndelight the eye and the mind. And yet, poor and meager as the\r\nintellectual life of the colonists may seem by way of comparison, heroic\r\nefforts were made in every community to lift the people above the plane\r\nof mere existence. After the first clearings were opened in the forests\r\nthose efforts were redoubled, and with lengthening years told upon the\r\nthought and spirit of the land. The appearance, during the struggle with\r\nEngland, of an extraordinary group of leaders familiar with history,\r\npolitical philosophy, and the arts of war, government, and diplomacy\r\nitself bore eloquent testimony to the high quality of the American\r\nintellect. No one, not even the most critical, can run through the\r\nwritings of distinguished Americans scattered from Massachusetts to\r\nGeorgia--the Adamses, Ellsworth, the Morrises, the Livingstons,\r\nHamilton, Franklin, Washington, Madison, Marshall, Henry, the Randolphs,\r\nand the Pinckneys--without coming to the conclusion that there was\r\nsomething in American colonial life which fostered minds of depth and\r\npower. Women surmounted even greater difficulties than the men in the\r\nprocess of self-education, and their keen interest in public issues is\r\nevident in many a record like the _Letters_ of Mrs. John Adams to her\r\nhusband during the Revolution; the writings of Mrs. Mercy Otis Warren,\r\nthe sister of James Otis, who measured her pen with the British\r\npropagandists; and the patriot newspapers founded and managed by women.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEADERSHIP OF THE CHURCHES\r\n\r\nIn the intellectual life of America, the churches assumed a rôle of high\r\nimportance. There were abundant reasons for this. In many of the\r\ncolonies--Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New England--the religious impulse\r\nhad been one of the impelling motives in stimulating immigration. In all\r\nthe colonies, the clergy, at least in the beginning, formed the only\r\nclass with any leisure to devote to matters of the spirit. They preached\r\non Sundays and taught school on week days. They led in the discussion of\r\nlocal problems and in the formation of political opinion, so much of\r\nwhich was concerned with the relation between church and state. They\r\nwrote books and pamphlets. They filled most of the chairs in the\r\ncolleges; under clerical guidance, intellectual and spiritual, the\r\nAmericans received their formal education. In several of the provinces\r\nthe Anglican Church was established by law. In New England the Puritans\r\nwere supreme, notwithstanding the efforts of the crown to overbear their\r\nauthority. In the Middle colonies, particularly, the multiplication of\r\nsects made the dominance of any single denomination impossible; and in\r\nall of them there was a growing diversity of faith, which promised in\r\ntime a separation of church and state and freedom of opinion.\r\n\r\n=The Church of England.=--Virginia was the stronghold of the English\r\nsystem of church and state. The Anglican faith and worship were\r\nprescribed by law, sustained by taxes imposed on all, and favored by the\r\ngovernor, the provincial councilors, and the richest planters. \"The\r\nEstablished Church,\" says Lodge, \"was one of the appendages of the\r\nVirginia aristocracy. They controlled the vestries and the ministers,\r\nand the parish church stood not infrequently on the estate of the\r\nplanter who built and managed it.\" As in England, Catholics and\r\nProtestant Dissenters were at first laid under heavy disabilities. Only\r\nslowly and on sufferance were they admitted to the province; but when\r\nonce they were even covertly tolerated, they pressed steadily in, until,\r\nby the Revolution, they outnumbered the adherents of the established\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe Church was also sanctioned by law and supported by taxes in the\r\nCarolinas after 1704, and in Georgia after that colony passed directly\r\nunder the crown in 1754--this in spite of the fact that the majority of\r\nthe inhabitants were Dissenters. Against the protests of the Catholics\r\nit was likewise established in Maryland. In New York, too,\r\nnotwithstanding the resistance of the Dutch, the Established Church was\r\nfostered by the provincial officials, and the Anglicans, embracing about\r\none-fifteenth of the population, exerted an influence all out of\r\nproportion to their numbers.\r\n\r\nMany factors helped to enhance the power of the English Church in the\r\ncolonies. It was supported by the British government and the official\r\nclass sent out to the provinces. Its bishops and archbishops in England\r\nwere appointed by the king, and its faith and service were set forth by\r\nacts of Parliament. Having its seat of power in the English monarchy, it\r\ncould hold its clergy and missionaries loyal to the crown and so\r\ncounteract to some extent the independent spirit that was growing up in\r\nAmerica. The Church, always a strong bulwark of the state, therefore had\r\na political rôle to play here as in England. Able bishops and far-seeing\r\nleaders firmly grasped this fact about the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury and redoubled their efforts to augment the influence of the\r\nChurch in provincial affairs. Unhappily for their plans they failed to\r\ncalculate in advance the effect of their methods upon dissenting\r\nProtestants, who still cherished memories of bitter religious conflicts\r\nin the mother country.\r\n\r\n=Puritanism in New England.=--If the established faith made for imperial\r\nunity, the same could not be said of Puritanism. The Plymouth Pilgrims\r\nhad cast off all allegiance to the Anglican Church and established a\r\nseparate and independent congregation before they came to America. The\r\nPuritans, essaying at first the task of reformers within the Church,\r\nsoon after their arrival in Massachusetts, likewise flung off their yoke\r\nof union with the Anglicans. In each town a separate congregation was\r\norganized, the male members choosing the pastor, the teachers, and the\r\nother officers. They also composed the voters in the town meeting, where\r\nsecular matters were determined. The union of church and government was\r\nthus complete, and uniformity of faith and life prescribed by law and\r\nenforced by civil authorities; but this worked for local autonomy\r\ninstead of imperial unity.\r\n\r\nThe clergy became a powerful class, dominant through their learning and\r\ntheir fearful denunciations of the faithless. They wrote the books for\r\nthe people to read--the famous Cotton Mather having three hundred and\r\neighty-three books and pamphlets to his credit. In coöperation with the\r\ncivil officers they enforced a strict observance of the Puritan\r\nSabbath--a day of rest that began at six o'clock on Saturday evening and\r\nlasted until sunset on Sunday. All work, all trading, all amusement, and\r\nall worldly conversation were absolutely prohibited during those hours.\r\nA thoughtless maid servant who for some earthly reason smiled in church\r\nwas in danger of being banished as a vagabond. Robert Pike, a devout\r\nPuritan, thinking the sun had gone to rest, ventured forth on horseback\r\none Sunday evening and was luckless enough to have a ray of light strike\r\nhim through a rift in the clouds. The next day he was brought into court\r\nand fined for \"his ungodly conduct.\" With persons accused of witchcraft\r\nthe Puritans were still more ruthless. When a mania of persecution swept\r\nover Massachusetts in 1692, eighteen people were hanged, one was pressed\r\nto death, many suffered imprisonment, and two died in jail.\r\n\r\nJust about this time, however, there came a break in the uniformity of\r\nPuritan rule. The crown and church in England had long looked upon it\r\nwith disfavor, and in 1684 King Charles II annulled the old charter of\r\nthe Massachusetts Bay Company. A new document issued seven years later\r\nwrested from the Puritans of the colony the right to elect their own\r\ngovernor and reserved the power of appointment to the king. It also\r\nabolished the rule limiting the suffrage to church members, substituting\r\nfor it a simple property qualification. Thus a royal governor and an\r\nofficial family, certain to be Episcopalian in faith and monarchist in\r\nsympathies, were forced upon Massachusetts; and members of all religious\r\ndenominations, if they had the required amount of property, were\r\npermitted to take part in elections. By this act in the name of the\r\ncrown, the Puritan monopoly was broken down in Massachusetts, and that\r\nprovince was brought into line with Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New\r\nHampshire, where property, not religious faith, was the test for the\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\n=Growth of Religious Toleration.=--Though neither the Anglicans of\r\nVirginia nor the Puritans of Massachusetts believed in toleration for\r\nother denominations, that principle was strictly applied in Rhode\r\nIsland. There, under the leadership of Roger Williams, liberty in\r\nmatters of conscience was established in the beginning. Maryland, by\r\ngranting in 1649 freedom to those who professed to believe in Jesus\r\nChrist, opened its gates to all Christians; and Pennsylvania, true to\r\nthe tenets of the Friends, gave freedom of conscience to those \"who\r\nconfess and acknowledge the one Almighty and Eternal God to be the\r\ncreator, upholder, and ruler of the World.\" By one circumstance or\r\nanother, the Middle colonies were thus early characterized by diversity\r\nrather than uniformity of opinion. Dutch Protestants, Huguenots,\r\nQuakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, New Lights, Moravians, Lutherans,\r\nCatholics, and other denominations became too strongly intrenched and\r\ntoo widely scattered to permit any one of them to rule, if it had\r\ndesired to do so. There were communities and indeed whole sections where\r\none or another church prevailed, but in no colony was a legislature\r\nsteadily controlled by a single group. Toleration encouraged diversity,\r\nand diversity, in turn, worked for greater toleration.\r\n\r\nThe government and faith of the dissenting denominations conspired with\r\neconomic and political tendencies to draw America away from the English\r\nstate. Presbyterians, Quakers, Baptists, and Puritans had no hierarchy\r\nof bishops and archbishops to bind them to the seat of power in London.\r\nNeither did they look to that metropolis for guidance in interpreting\r\narticles of faith. Local self-government in matters ecclesiastical\r\nhelped to train them for local self-government in matters political. The\r\nspirit of independence which led Dissenters to revolt in the Old World,\r\nnourished as it was amid favorable circumstances in the New World, made\r\nthem all the more zealous in the defense of every right against\r\nauthority imposed from without.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS AND COLLEGES\r\n\r\n=Religion and Local Schools.=--One of the first cares of each Protestant\r\ndenomination was the education of the children in the faith. In this\r\nwork the Bible became the center of interest. The English version was\r\nindeed the one book of the people. Farmers, shopkeepers, and artisans,\r\nwhose life had once been bounded by the daily routine of labor, found in\r\nthe Scriptures not only an inspiration to religious conduct, but also a\r\nbook of romance, travel, and history. \"Legend and annal,\" says John\r\nRichard Green, \"war-song and psalm, state-roll and biography, the mighty\r\nvoices of prophets, the parables of Evangelists, stories of mission\r\njourneys, of perils by sea and among the heathen, philosophic arguments,\r\napocalyptic visions, all were flung broadcast over minds unoccupied for\r\nthe most part by any rival learning.... As a mere literary monument, the\r\nEnglish version of the Bible remains the noblest example of the English\r\ntongue.\" It was the King James version just from the press that the\r\nPilgrims brought across the sea with them.\r\n\r\nFor the authority of the Established Church was substituted the\r\nauthority of the Scriptures. The Puritans devised a catechism based upon\r\ntheir interpretation of the Bible, and, very soon after their arrival in\r\nAmerica, they ordered all parents and masters of servants to be diligent\r\nin seeing that their children and wards were taught to read religious\r\nworks and give answers to the religious questions. Massachusetts was\r\nscarcely twenty years old before education of this character was\r\ndeclared to be compulsory, and provision was made for public schools\r\nwhere those not taught at home could receive instruction in reading and\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PAGE FROM A FAMOUS SCHOOLBOOK\r\n\r\n\r\n     A In ADAM'S Fall\r\n       We sinned all.\r\n\r\n     B Heaven to find,\r\n       The Bible Mind.\r\n\r\n     C Christ crucify'd\r\n       For sinners dy'd.\r\n\r\n     D The Deluge drown'd\r\n       The Earth around.\r\n\r\n     E ELIJAH hid\r\n       by Ravens fed.\r\n\r\n     F The judgment made\r\n       FELIX afraid.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside of New England the idea of compulsory education was not regarded\r\nwith the same favor; but the whole land was nevertheless dotted with\r\nlittle schools kept by \"dames, itinerant teachers, or local parsons.\"\r\nWhether we turn to the life of Franklin in the North or Washington in\r\nthe South, we read of tiny schoolhouses, where boys, and sometimes\r\ngirls, were taught to read and write. Where there were no schools,\r\nfathers and mothers of the better kind gave their children the rudiments\r\nof learning. Though illiteracy was widespread, there is evidence to show\r\nthat the diffusion of knowledge among the masses was making steady\r\nprogress all through the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n=Religion and Higher Learning.=--Religious motives entered into the\r\nestablishment of colleges as well as local schools. Harvard, founded in\r\n1636, and Yale, opened in 1718, were intended primarily to train\r\n\"learned and godly ministers\" for the Puritan churches of New England.\r\nTo the far North, Dartmouth, chartered in 1769, was designed first as a\r\nmission to the Indians and then as a college for the sons of New England\r\nfarmers preparing to preach, teach, or practice law. The College of New\r\nJersey, organized in 1746 and removed to Princeton eleven years later,\r\nwas sustained by the Presbyterians. Two colleges looked to the\r\nEstablished Church as their source of inspiration and support: William\r\nand Mary, founded in Virginia in 1693, and King's College, now Columbia\r\nUniversity, chartered by King George II in 1754, on an appeal from the\r\nNew York Anglicans, alarmed at the growth of religious dissent and the\r\n\"republican tendencies\" of the age. Two colleges revealed a drift away\r\nfrom sectarianism. Brown, established in Rhode Island in 1764, and the\r\nPhiladelphia Academy, forerunner of the University of Pennsylvania,\r\norganized by Benjamin Franklin, reflected the spirit of toleration by\r\ngiving representation on the board of trustees to several religious\r\nsects. It was Franklin's idea that his college should prepare young men\r\nto serve in public office as leaders of the people and ornaments to\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\n=Self-education in America.=--Important as were these institutions of\r\nlearning, higher education was by no means confined within their walls.\r\nMany well-to-do families sent their sons to Oxford or Cambridge in\r\nEngland. Private tutoring in the home was common. In still more families\r\nthere were intelligent children who grew up in the great colonial school\r\nof adversity and who trained themselves until, in every contest of mind\r\nand wit, they could vie with the sons of Harvard or William and Mary or\r\nany other college. Such, for example, was Benjamin Franklin, whose\r\ncharming autobiography, in addition to being an American classic, is a\r\nfine record of self-education. His formal training in the classroom was\r\nlimited to a few years at a local school in Boston; but his\r\nself-education continued throughout his life. He early manifested a zeal\r\nfor reading, and devoured, he tells us, his father's dry library on\r\ntheology, Bunyan's works, Defoe's writings, Plutarch's _Lives_, Locke's\r\n_On the Human Understanding_, and innumerable volumes dealing with\r\nsecular subjects. His literary style, perhaps the best of his time,\r\nFranklin acquired by the diligent and repeated analysis of the\r\n_Spectator_. In a life crowded with labors, he found time to read widely\r\nin natural science and to win single-handed recognition at the hands of\r\nEuropean savants for his discoveries in electricity. By his own efforts\r\nhe \"attained an acquaintance\" with Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish,\r\nthus unconsciously preparing himself for the day when he was to speak\r\nfor all America at the court of the king of France.\r\n\r\nLesser lights than Franklin, educated by the same process, were found\r\nall over colonial America. From this fruitful source of native ability,\r\nself-educated, the American cause drew great strength in the trials of\r\nthe Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIAL PRESS\r\n\r\n=The Rise of the Newspaper.=--The evolution of American democracy into a\r\ngovernment by public opinion, enlightened by the open discussion of\r\npolitical questions, was in no small measure aided by a free press. That\r\ntoo, like education, was a matter of slow growth. A printing press was\r\nbrought to Massachusetts in 1639, but it was put in charge of an\r\nofficial censor and limited to the publication of religious works. Forty\r\nyears elapsed before the first newspaper appeared, bearing the curious\r\ntitle, _Public Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestic_, and it had not\r\nbeen running very long before the government of Massachusetts suppressed\r\nit for discussing a political question.\r\n\r\nPublishing, indeed, seemed to be a precarious business; but in 1704\r\nthere came a second venture in journalism, _The Boston News-Letter_,\r\nwhich proved to be a more lasting enterprise because it refrained from\r\ncriticizing the authorities. Still the public interest languished. When\r\nFranklin's brother, James, began to issue his _New England Courant_\r\nabout 1720, his friends sought to dissuade him, saying that one\r\nnewspaper was enough for America. Nevertheless he continued it; and his\r\nconfidence in the future was rewarded. In nearly every colony a gazette\r\nor chronicle appeared within the next thirty years or more. Benjamin\r\nFranklin was able to record in 1771 that America had twenty-five\r\nnewspapers. Boston led with five. Philadelphia had three: two in English\r\nand one in German.\r\n\r\n=Censorship and Restraints on the Press.=--The idea of printing,\r\nunlicensed by the government and uncontrolled by the church, was,\r\nhowever, slow in taking form. The founders of the American colonies had\r\nnever known what it was to have the free and open publication of books,\r\npamphlets, broadsides, and newspapers. When the art of printing was\r\nfirst discovered, the control of publishing was vested in clerical\r\nauthorities. After the establishment of the State Church in England in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, censorship of the press became a part of royal\r\nprerogative. Printing was restricted to Oxford, Cambridge, and London;\r\nand no one could publish anything without previous approval of the\r\nofficial censor. When the Puritans were in power, the popular party,\r\nwith a zeal which rivaled that of the crown, sought, in turn, to silence\r\nroyalist and clerical writers by a vigorous censorship. After the\r\nrestoration of the monarchy, control of the press was once more placed\r\nin royal hands, where it remained until 1695, when Parliament, by\r\nfailing to renew the licensing act, did away entirely with the official\r\ncensorship. By that time political parties were so powerful and so\r\nactive and printing presses were so numerous that official review of all\r\npublished matter became a sheer impossibility.\r\n\r\nIn America, likewise, some troublesome questions arose in connection\r\nwith freedom of the press. The Puritans of Massachusetts were no less\r\nanxious than King Charles or the Archbishop of London to shut out from\r\nthe prying eyes of the people all literature \"not mete for them to\r\nread\"; and so they established a system of official licensing for\r\npresses, which lasted until 1755. In the other colonies where there was\r\nmore diversity of opinion and publishers could set up in business with\r\nimpunity, they were nevertheless constantly liable to arrest for\r\nprinting anything displeasing to the colonial governments. In 1721 the\r\neditor of the _Mercury_ in Philadelphia was called before the\r\nproprietary council and ordered to apologize for a political article,\r\nand for a later offense of a similar character he was thrown into jail.\r\nA still more famous case was that of Peter Zenger, a New York publisher,\r\nwho was arrested in 1735 for criticising the administration. Lawyers who\r\nventured to defend the unlucky editor were deprived of their licenses to\r\npractice, and it became necessary to bring an attorney all the way from\r\nPhiladelphia. By this time the tension of feeling was high, and the\r\napprobation of the public was forthcoming when the lawyer for the\r\ndefense exclaimed to the jury that the very cause of liberty itself, not\r\nthat of the poor printer, was on trial! The verdict for Zenger, when it\r\nfinally came, was the signal for an outburst of popular rejoicing.\r\nAlready the people of King George's province knew how precious a thing\r\nis the freedom of the press.\r\n\r\nThanks to the schools, few and scattered as they were, and to the\r\nvigilance of parents, a very large portion, perhaps nearly one-half, of\r\nthe colonists could read. Through the newspapers, pamphlets, and\r\nalmanacs that streamed from the types, the people could follow the\r\ncourse of public events and grasp the significance of political\r\narguments. An American opinion was in the process of making--an\r\nindependent opinion nourished by the press and enriched by discussions\r\naround the fireside and at the taverns. When the day of resistance to\r\nBritish rule came, government by opinion was at hand. For every person\r\nwho could hear the voice of Patrick Henry and Samuel Adams, there were a\r\nthousand who could see their appeals on the printed page. Men who had\r\nspelled out their letters while poring over Franklin's _Poor Richard's\r\nAlmanac_ lived to read Thomas Paine's thrilling call to arms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION IN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\nTwo very distinct lines of development appeared in colonial politics.\r\nThe one, exalting royal rights and aristocratic privileges, was the\r\ndrift toward provincial government through royal officers appointed in\r\nEngland. The other, leading toward democracy and self-government, was\r\nthe growth in the power of the popular legislative assembly. Each\r\nmovement gave impetus to the other, with increasing force during the\r\npassing years, until at last the final collision between the two ideals\r\nof government came in the war of independence.\r\n\r\n=The Royal Provinces.=--Of the thirteen English colonies eight were\r\nroyal provinces in 1776, with governors appointed by the king. Virginia\r\npassed under the direct rule of the crown in 1624, when the charter of\r\nthe London Company was annulled. The Massachusetts Bay corporation lost\r\nits charter in 1684, and the new instrument granted seven years later\r\nstripped the colonists of the right to choose their chief executive. In\r\nthe early decades of the eighteenth century both the Carolinas were\r\ngiven the provincial instead of the proprietary form. New Hampshire,\r\nsevered from Massachusetts in 1679, and Georgia, surrendered by the\r\ntrustees in 1752, went into the hands of the crown. New York,\r\ntransferred to the Duke of York on its capture from the Dutch in 1664,\r\nbecame a province when he took the title of James II in 1685. New\r\nJersey, after remaining for nearly forty years under proprietors, was\r\nbrought directly under the king in 1702. Maryland, Pennsylvania, and\r\nDelaware, although they retained their proprietary character until the\r\nRevolution, were in some respects like the royal colonies, for their\r\ngovernors were as independent of popular choice as were the appointees\r\nof King George. Only two colonies, Rhode Island and Connecticut,\r\nretained full self-government on the eve of the Revolution. They alone\r\nhad governors and legislatures entirely of their own choosing.\r\n\r\nThe chief officer of the royal province was the governor, who enjoyed\r\nhigh and important powers which he naturally sought to augment at every\r\nturn. He enforced the laws and, usually with the consent of a council,\r\nappointed the civil and military officers. He granted pardons and\r\nreprieves; he was head of the highest court; he was commander-in-chief\r\nof the militia; he levied troops for defense and enforced martial law in\r\ntime of invasion, war, and rebellion. In all the provinces, except\r\nMassachusetts, he named the councilors who composed the upper house of\r\nthe legislature and was likely to choose those who favored his claims.\r\nHe summoned, adjourned, and dissolved the popular assembly, or the lower\r\nhouse; he laid before it the projects of law desired by the crown; and\r\nhe vetoed measures which he thought objectionable. Here were in America\r\nall the elements of royal prerogative against which Hampden had\r\nprotested and Cromwell had battled in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROYAL GOVERNOR'S PALACE AT NEW BERNE]\r\n\r\nThe colonial governors were generally surrounded by a body of\r\noffice-seekers and hunters for land grants. Some of them were noblemen\r\nof broken estates who had come to America to improve their fortunes. The\r\npretensions of this circle grated on colonial nerves, and privileges\r\ngranted to them, often at the expense of colonists, did much to deepen\r\npopular antipathy to the British government. Favors extended to\r\nadherents of the Established Church displeased Dissenters. The\r\nreappearance of this formidable union of church and state, from which\r\nthey had fled, stirred anew the ancient wrath against that combination.\r\n\r\n=The Colonial Assembly.=--Coincident with the drift toward\r\nadministration through royal governors was the second and opposite\r\ntendency, namely, a steady growth in the practice of self-government.\r\nThe voters of England had long been accustomed to share in taxation and\r\nlaw-making through representatives in Parliament, and the idea was early\r\nintroduced in America. Virginia was only twelve years old (1619) when\r\nits first representative assembly appeared. As the towns of\r\nMassachusetts multiplied and it became impossible for all the members of\r\nthe corporation to meet at one place, the representative idea was\r\nadopted, in 1633. The river towns of Connecticut formed a representative\r\nsystem under their \"Fundamental Orders\" of 1639, and the entire colony\r\nwas given a royal charter in 1662. Generosity, as well as practical\r\nconsiderations, induced such proprietors as Lord Baltimore and William\r\nPenn to invite their colonists to share in the government as soon as any\r\nconsiderable settlements were made. Thus by one process or another every\r\none of the colonies secured a popular assembly.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the provision for popular elections, the suffrage was\r\nfinally restricted to property owners or taxpayers, with a leaning\r\ntoward the freehold qualification. In Virginia, the rural voter had to\r\nbe a freeholder owning at least fifty acres of land, if there was no\r\nhouse on it, or twenty-five acres with a house twenty-five feet square.\r\nIn Massachusetts, the voter for member of the assembly under the charter\r\nof 1691 had to be a freeholder of an estate worth forty shillings a year\r\nat least or of other property to the value of forty pounds sterling. In\r\nPennsylvania, the suffrage was granted to freeholders owning fifty acres\r\nor more of land well seated, twelve acres cleared, and to other persons\r\nworth at least fifty pounds in lawful money.\r\n\r\nRestrictions like these undoubtedly excluded from the suffrage a very\r\nconsiderable number of men, particularly the mechanics and artisans of\r\nthe towns, who were by no means content with their position.\r\nNevertheless, it was relatively easy for any man to acquire a small\r\nfreehold, so cheap and abundant was land; and in fact a large proportion\r\nof the colonists were land owners. Thus the assemblies, in spite of the\r\nlimited suffrage, acquired a democratic tone.\r\n\r\nThe popular character of the assemblies increased as they became engaged\r\nin battles with the royal and proprietary governors. When called upon by\r\nthe executive to make provision for the support of the administration,\r\nthe legislature took advantage of the opportunity to make terms in the\r\ninterest of the taxpayers. It made annual, not permanent, grants of\r\nmoney to pay official salaries and then insisted upon electing a\r\ntreasurer to dole it out. Thus the colonists learned some of the\r\nmysteries of public finance, as well as the management of rapacious\r\nofficials. The legislature also used its power over money grants to\r\nforce the governor to sign bills which he would otherwise have vetoed.\r\n\r\n=Contests between Legislatures and Governors.=--As may be imagined, many\r\nand bitter were the contests between the royal and proprietary governors\r\nand the colonial assemblies. Franklin relates an amusing story of how\r\nthe Pennsylvania assembly held in one hand a bill for the executive to\r\nsign and, in the other hand, the money to pay his salary. Then, with sly\r\nhumor, Franklin adds: \"Do not, my courteous reader, take pet at our\r\nproprietary constitution for these our bargain and sale proceedings in\r\nlegislation. It is a happy country where justice and what was your own\r\nbefore can be had for ready money. It is another addition to the value\r\nof money and of course another spur to industry. Every land is not so\r\nblessed.\"\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought, however, that every governor got off as easily\r\nas Franklin's tale implies. On the contrary, the legislatures, like\r\nCæsar, fed upon meat that made them great and steadily encroached upon\r\nexecutive prerogatives as they tried out and found their strength. If\r\nwe may believe contemporary laments, the power of the crown in America\r\nwas diminishing when it was struck down altogether. In New York, the\r\nfriends of the governor complained in 1747 that \"the inhabitants of\r\nplantations are generally educated in republican principles; upon\r\nrepublican principles all is conducted. Little more than a shadow of\r\nroyal authority remains in the Northern colonies.\" \"Here,\" echoed the\r\ngovernor of South Carolina, the following year, \"levelling principles\r\nprevail; the frame of the civil government is unhinged; a governor, if\r\nhe would be idolized, must betray his trust; the people have got their\r\nwhole administration in their hands; the election of the members of the\r\nassembly is by ballot; not civil posts only, but all ecclesiastical\r\npreferments, are in the disposal or election of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThough baffled by the \"levelling principles\" of the colonial assemblies,\r\nthe governors did not give up the case as hopeless. Instead they evolved\r\na system of policy and action which they thought could bring the\r\nobstinate provincials to terms. That system, traceable in their letters\r\nto the government in London, consisted of three parts: (1) the royal\r\nofficers in the colonies were to be made independent of the legislatures\r\nby taxes imposed by acts of Parliament; (2) a British standing army was\r\nto be maintained in America; (3) the remaining colonial charters were to\r\nbe revoked and government by direct royal authority was to be enlarged.\r\n\r\nSuch a system seemed plausible enough to King George III and to many\r\nministers of the crown in London. With governors, courts, and an army\r\nindependent of the colonists, they imagined it would be easy to carry\r\nout both royal orders and acts of Parliament. This reasoning seemed both\r\npractical and logical. Nor was it founded on theory, for it came fresh\r\nfrom the governors themselves. It was wanting in one respect only. It\r\nfailed to take account of the fact that the American people were growing\r\nstrong in the practice of self-government and could dispense with the\r\ntutelage of the British ministry, no matter how excellent it might be or\r\nhow benevolent its intentions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nA.M.

The imperative call to common\r\ndefense, the habit of sharing common burdens, the fusing force of common\r\nservice--these things, induced by the necessity of resisting outside\r\ninterference, act as an amalgam drawing together all elements, except,\r\nperhaps, the most discordant. The presence of the enemy allays the most\r\nvirulent of quarrels, temporarily at least. \"Politics,\" runs an old\r\nsaying, \"stops at the water's edge.\"\r\n\r\nThis ancient political principle, so well understood in diplomatic\r\ncircles, applied nearly as well to the original thirteen American\r\ncolonies as to the countries of Europe. The necessity for common\r\ndefense, if not equally great, was certainly always pressing. Though it\r\nhas long been the practice to speak of the early settlements as founded\r\nin \"a wilderness,\" this was not actually the case. From the earliest\r\ndays of Jamestown on through the years, the American people were\r\nconfronted by dangers from without. All about their tiny settlements\r\nwere Indians, growing more and more hostile as the frontier advanced and\r\nas sharp conflicts over land aroused angry passions. To the south and\r\nwest was the power of Spain, humiliated, it is true, by the disaster to\r\nthe Armada, but still presenting an imposing front to the British\r\nempire. To the north and west were the French, ambitious, energetic,\r\nimperial in temper, and prepared to contest on land and water the\r\nadvance of British dominion in America.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIONS WITH THE INDIANS AND THE FRENCH\r\n\r\n=Indian Affairs.=--It is difficult to make general statements about the\r\nrelations of the colonists to the Indians. The problem was presented in\r\ndifferent shape in different sections of America. It was not handled\r\naccording to any coherent or uniform plan by the British government,\r\nwhich alone could speak for all the provinces at the same time. Neither\r\ndid the proprietors and the governors who succeeded one another, in an\r\nirregular train, have the consistent policy or the matured experience\r\nnecessary for dealing wisely with Indian matters. As the difficulties\r\narose mainly on the frontiers, where the restless and pushing pioneers\r\nwere making their way with gun and ax, nearly everything that happened\r\nwas the result of chance rather than of calculation. A personal quarrel\r\nbetween traders and an Indian, a jug of whisky, a keg of gunpowder, the\r\nexchange of guns for furs, personal treachery, or a flash of bad temper\r\noften set in motion destructive forces of the most terrible character.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the ledger may be set innumerable generous records--of\r\nSquanto and Samoset teaching the Pilgrims the ways of the wilds; of\r\nRoger Williams buying his lands from the friendly natives; or of William\r\nPenn treating with them on his arrival in America. On the other side of\r\nthe ledger must be recorded many a cruel and bloody conflict as the\r\nfrontier rolled westward with deadly precision. The Pequots on the\r\nConnecticut border, sensing their doom, fell upon the tiny settlements\r\nwith awful fury in 1637 only to meet with equally terrible punishment. A\r\ngeneration later, King Philip, son of Massasoit, the friend of the\r\nPilgrims, called his tribesmen to a war of extermination which brought\r\nthe strength of all New England to the field and ended in his own\r\ndestruction. In New York, the relations with the Indians, especially\r\nwith the Algonquins and the Mohawks, were marked by periodic and\r\ndesperate wars. Virginia and her Southern neighbors suffered as did New\r\nEngland. In 1622 Opecacano, a brother of Powhatan, the friend of the\r\nJamestown settlers, launched a general massacre; and in 1644 he\r\nattempted a war of extermination. In 1675 the whole frontier was ablaze.\r\nNathaniel Bacon vainly attempted to stir the colonial governor to put up\r\nan adequate defense and, failing in that plea, himself headed a revolt\r\nand a successful expedition against the Indians. As the Virginia\r\noutposts advanced into the Kentucky country, the strife with the natives\r\nwas transferred to that \"dark and bloody ground\"; while to the\r\nsoutheast, a desperate struggle with the Tuscaroras called forth the\r\ncombined forces of the two Carolinas and Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\r\n\r\nVIRGINIANS DEFENDING THEMSELVES AGAINST THE INDIANS]\r\n\r\nFrom such horrors New Jersey and Delaware were saved on account of their\r\ngeographical location. Pennsylvania, consistently following a policy of\r\nconciliation, was likewise spared until her western vanguard came into\r\nfull conflict with the allied French and Indians. Georgia, by clever\r\nnegotiations and treaties of alliance, managed to keep on fair terms\r\nwith her belligerent Cherokees and Creeks. But neither diplomacy nor\r\ngenerosity could stay the inevitable conflict as the frontier advanced,\r\nespecially after the French soldiers enlisted the Indians in their\r\nimperial enterprises. It was then that desultory fighting became general\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGLISH, FRENCH, AND SPANISH POSSESSIONS IN AMERICA,\r\n1750]\r\n\r\n=Early Relations with the French.=--During the first decades of French\r\nexploration and settlement in the St. Lawrence country, the English\r\ncolonies, engrossed with their own problems, gave little or no thought\r\nto their distant neighbors. Quebec, founded in 1608, and Montreal, in\r\n1642, were too far away, too small in population, and too slight in\r\nstrength to be much of a menace to Boston, Hartford, or New York. It was\r\nthe statesmen in France and England, rather than the colonists in\r\nAmerica, who first grasped the significance of the slowly converging\r\nempires in North America. It was the ambition of Louis XIV of France,\r\nrather than the labors of Jesuit missionaries and French rangers, that\r\nsounded the first note of colonial alarm.\r\n\r\nEvidence of this lies in the fact that three conflicts between the\r\nEnglish and the French occurred before their advancing frontiers met on\r\nthe Pennsylvania border. King William's War (1689-1697), Queen Anne's\r\nWar (1701-1713), and King George's War (1744-1748) owed their origins\r\nand their endings mainly to the intrigues and rivalries of European\r\npowers, although they all involved the American colonies in struggles\r\nwith the French and their savage allies.\r\n\r\n=The Clash in the Ohio Valley.=--The second of these wars had hardly\r\nclosed, however, before the English colonists themselves began to be\r\nseriously alarmed about the rapidly expanding French dominion in the\r\nWest. Marquette and Joliet, who opened the Lake region, and La Salle,\r\nwho in 1682 had gone down the Mississippi to the Gulf, had been followed\r\nby the builders of forts. In 1718, the French founded New Orleans, thus\r\ntaking possession of the gateway to the Mississippi as well as the St.\r\nLawrence. A few years later they built Fort Niagara; in 1731 they\r\noccupied Crown Point; in 1749 they formally announced their dominion\r\nover all the territory drained by the Ohio River. Having asserted this\r\nlofty claim, they set out to make it good by constructing in the years\r\n1752-1754 Fort Le Boeuf near Lake Erie, Fort Venango on the upper\r\nwaters of the Allegheny, and Fort Duquesne at the junction of the\r\nstreams forming the Ohio. Though they were warned by George Washington,\r\nin the name of the governor of Virginia, to keep out of territory \"so\r\nnotoriously known to be property of the crown of Great Britain,\" the\r\nFrench showed no signs of relinquishing their pretensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nBRADDOCK'S RETREAT]\r\n\r\n=The Final Phase--the French and Indian War.=--Thus it happened that the\r\nshot which opened the Seven Years' War, known in America as the French\r\nand Indian War, was fired in the wilds of Pennsylvania. There began the\r\nconflict that spread to Europe and even Asia and finally involved\r\nEngland and Prussia, on the one side, and France, Austria, Spain, and\r\nminor powers on the other. On American soil, the defeat of Braddock in\r\n1755 and Wolfe's exploit in capturing Quebec four years later were the\r\ndramatic features. On the continent of Europe, England subsidized\r\nPrussian arms to hold France at bay. In India, on the banks of the\r\nGanges, as on the banks of the St. Lawrence, British arms were\r\ntriumphant. Well could the historian write: \"Conquests equaling in\r\nrapidity and far surpassing in magnitude those of Cortes and Pizarro had\r\nbeen achieved in the East.\" Well could the merchants of London declare\r\nthat under the administration of William Pitt, the imperial genius of\r\nthis world-wide conflict, commerce had been \"united with and made to\r\nflourish by war.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the British empire, the results of the war\r\nwere momentous. By the peace of 1763, Canada and the territory east of\r\nthe Mississippi, except New Orleans, passed under the British flag. The\r\nremainder of the Louisiana territory was transferred to Spain and French\r\nimperial ambitions on the American continent were laid to rest. In\r\nexchange for Havana, which the British had seized during the war, Spain\r\nceded to King George the colony of Florida. Not without warrant did\r\nMacaulay write in after years that Pitt \"was the first Englishman of his\r\ntime; and he had made England the first country in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECTS OF WARFARE ON THE COLONIES\r\n\r\nThe various wars with the French and the Indians, trivial in detail as\r\nthey seem to-day, had a profound influence on colonial life and on the\r\ndestiny of America. Circumstances beyond the control of popular\r\nassemblies, jealous of their individual powers, compelled coöperation\r\namong them, grudging and stingy no doubt, but still coöperation. The\r\nAmerican people, more eager to be busy in their fields or at their\r\ntrades, were simply forced to raise and support armies, to learn the\r\narts of warfare, and to practice, if in a small theater, the science of\r\nstatecraft. These forces, all cumulative, drove the colonists, so\r\ntenaciously provincial in their habits, in the direction of nationalism.\r\n\r\n=The New England Confederation.=--It was in their efforts to deal with\r\nthe problems presented by the Indian and French menace that the\r\nAmericans took the first steps toward union. Though there were many\r\ncommon ties among the settlers of New England, it required a deadly\r\nfear of the Indians to produce in 1643 the New England Confederation,\r\ncomposed of Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven. The\r\ncolonies so united were bound together in \"a firm and perpetual league\r\nof friendship and amity for offense and defense, mutual service and\r\nsuccor, upon all just occasions.\" They made provision for distributing\r\nthe burdens of wars among the members and provided for a congress of\r\ncommissioners from each colony to determine upon common policies. For\r\nsome twenty years the Confederation was active and it continued to hold\r\nmeetings until after the extinction of the Indian peril on the immediate\r\nborder.\r\n\r\nVirginia, no less than Massachusetts, was aware of the importance of\r\nintercolonial coöperation. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the\r\nOld Dominion began treaties of commerce and amity with New York and the\r\ncolonies of New England. In 1684 delegates from Virginia met at Albany\r\nwith the agents of New York and Massachusetts to discuss problems of\r\nmutual defense. A few years later the Old Dominion coöperated loyally\r\nwith the Carolinas in defending their borders against Indian forays.\r\n\r\n=The Albany Plan of Union.=--An attempt at a general colonial union was\r\nmade in 1754. On the suggestion of the Lords of Trade in England, a\r\nconference was held at Albany to consider Indian relations, to devise\r\nmeasures of defense against the French, and to enter into \"articles of\r\nunion and confederation for the general defense of his Majesty's\r\nsubjects and interests in North America as well in time of peace as of\r\nwar.\" New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York,\r\nPennsylvania, and Maryland were represented. After a long discussion, a\r\nplan of union, drafted mainly, it seems, by Benjamin Franklin, was\r\nadopted and sent to the colonies and the crown for approval. The\r\ncolonies, jealous of their individual rights, refused to accept the\r\nscheme and the king disapproved it for the reason, Franklin said, that\r\nit had \"too much weight in the democratic part of the constitution.\"\r\nThough the Albany union failed, the document is still worthy of study\r\nbecause it forecast many of the perplexing problems that were not solved\r\nuntil thirty-three years afterward, when another convention of which\r\nalso Franklin was a member drafted the Constitution of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN]\r\n\r\n=The Military Education of the Colonists.=--The same wars that showed\r\nthe provincials the meaning of union likewise instructed them in the art\r\nof defending their institutions. Particularly was this true of the last\r\nFrench and Indian conflict, which stretched all the way from Maine to\r\nthe Carolinas and made heavy calls upon them all for troops. The answer,\r\nit is admitted, was far from satisfactory to the British government and\r\nthe conduct of the militiamen was far from professional; but thousands\r\nof Americans got a taste, a strong taste, of actual fighting in the\r\nfield. Men like George Washington and Daniel Morgan learned lessons that\r\nwere not forgotten in after years. They saw what American militiamen\r\ncould do under favorable circumstances and they watched British regulars\r\noperating on American soil. \"This whole transaction,\" shrewdly remarked\r\nFranklin of Braddock's campaign, \"gave us Americans the first suspicion\r\nthat our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regular troops had not\r\nbeen well founded.\" It was no mere accident that the Virginia colonel\r\nwho drew his sword under the elm at Cambridge and took command of the\r\narmy of the Revolution was the brave officer who had \"spurned the\r\nwhistle of bullets\" at the memorable battle in western Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n=Financial Burdens and Commercial Disorder.=--While the provincials were\r\nlearning lessons in warfare they were also paying the bills. All the\r\nconflicts were costly in treasure as in blood. King Philip's war left\r\nNew England weak and almost bankrupt. The French and Indian struggle was\r\nespecially expensive. The twenty-five thousand men put in the field by\r\nthe colonies were sustained only by huge outlays of money. Paper\r\ncurrency streamed from the press and debts were accumulated. Commerce\r\nwas driven from its usual channels and prices were enhanced. When the\r\nend came, both England and America were staggering under heavy\r\nliabilities, and to make matters worse there was a fall of prices\r\naccompanied by a commercial depression which extended over a period of\r\nten years. It was in the midst of this crisis that measures of taxation\r\nhad to be devised to pay the cost of the war, precipitating the quarrel\r\nwhich led to American independence.\r\n\r\n=The Expulsion of French Power from North America.=--The effects of the\r\ndefeat administered to France, as time proved, were difficult to\r\nestimate. Some British statesmen regarded it as a happy circumstance\r\nthat the colonists, already restive under their administration, had no\r\nforeign power at hand to aid them in case they struck for independence.\r\nAmerican leaders, on the other hand, now that the soldiers of King Louis\r\nwere driven from the continent, thought that they had no other country\r\nto fear if they cast off British sovereignty. At all events, France,\r\nthough defeated, was not out of the sphere of American influence; for,\r\nas events proved, it was the fortunate French alliance negotiated by\r\nFranklin that assured the triumph of American arms in the War of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL RELATIONS WITH THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\nIt was neither the Indian wars nor the French wars that finally brought\r\nforth American nationality. That was the product of the long strife\r\nwith the mother country which culminated in union for the war of\r\nindependence. The forces that created this nation did not operate in the\r\ncolonies alone. The character of the English sovereigns, the course of\r\nevents in English domestic politics, and English measures of control\r\nover the colonies--executive, legislative, and judicial--must all be\r\ntaken into account.\r\n\r\n=The Last of the Stuarts.=--The struggles between Charles I (1625-49)\r\nand the parliamentary party and the turmoil of the Puritan régime\r\n(1649-60) so engrossed the attention of Englishmen at home that they had\r\nlittle time to think of colonial policies or to interfere with colonial\r\naffairs. The restoration of the monarchy in 1660, accompanied by\r\ninternal peace and the increasing power of the mercantile classes in the\r\nHouse of Commons, changed all that. In the reign of Charles II\r\n(1660-85), himself an easy-going person, the policy of regulating trade\r\nby act of Parliament was developed into a closely knit system and\r\npowerful agencies to supervise the colonies were created. At the same\r\ntime a system of stricter control over the dominions was ushered in by\r\nthe annulment of the old charter of Massachusetts which conferred so\r\nmuch self-government on the Puritans.\r\n\r\nCharles' successor, James II, a man of sterner stuff and jealous of his\r\nauthority in the colonies as well as at home, continued the policy thus\r\ninaugurated and enlarged upon it. If he could have kept his throne, he\r\nwould have bent the Americans under a harsh rule or brought on in his\r\ndominions a revolution like that which he precipitated at home in 1688.\r\nHe determined to unite the Northern colonies and introduce a more\r\nefficient administration based on the pattern of the royal provinces. He\r\nmade a martinet, Sir Edmund Andros, governor of all New England, New\r\nYork, and New Jersey. The charter of Massachusetts, annulled in the last\r\ndays of his brother's reign, he continued to ignore, and that of\r\nConnecticut would have been seized if it had not been spirited away and\r\nhidden, according to tradition, in a hollow oak.\r\n\r\nFor several months, Andros gave the Northern colonies a taste of\r\nill-tempered despotism. He wrung quit rents from land owners not\r\naccustomed to feudal dues; he abrogated titles to land where, in his\r\nopinion, they were unlawful; he forced the Episcopal service upon the\r\nOld South Church in Boston; and he denied the writ of _habeas corpus_ to\r\na preacher who denounced taxation without representation. In the middle\r\nof his arbitrary course, however, his hand was stayed. The news came\r\nthat King James had been dethroned by his angry subjects, and the people\r\nof Boston, kindling a fire on Beacon Hill, summoned the countryside to\r\ndispose of Andros. The response was prompt and hearty. The hated\r\ngovernor was arrested, imprisoned, and sent back across the sea under\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nThe overthrow of James, followed by the accession of William and Mary\r\nand by assured parliamentary supremacy, had an immediate effect in the\r\ncolonies. The new order was greeted with thanksgiving. Massachusetts was\r\ngiven another charter which, though not so liberal as the first,\r\nrestored the spirit if not the entire letter of self-government. In the\r\nother colonies where Andros had been operating, the old course of\r\naffairs was resumed.\r\n\r\n=The Indifference of the First Two Georges.=--On the death in 1714 of\r\nQueen Anne, the successor of King William, the throne passed to a\r\nHanoverian prince who, though grateful for English honors and revenues,\r\nwas more interested in Hanover than in England. George I and George II,\r\nwhose combined reigns extended from 1714 to 1760, never even learned to\r\nspeak the English language, at least without an accent. The necessity of\r\ntaking thought about colonial affairs bored both of them so that the\r\nstoutest defender of popular privileges in Boston or Charleston had no\r\nground to complain of the exercise of personal prerogatives by the king.\r\nMoreover, during a large part of this period, the direction of affairs\r\nwas in the hands of an astute leader, Sir Robert Walpole, who betrayed\r\nhis somewhat cynical view of politics by adopting as his motto: \"Let\r\nsleeping dogs lie.\" He revealed his appreciation of popular sentiment\r\nby exclaiming: \"I will not be the minister to enforce taxes at the\r\nexpense of blood.\" Such kings and such ministers were not likely to\r\narouse the slumbering resistance of the thirteen colonies across the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n=Control of the Crown over the Colonies.=--While no English ruler from\r\nJames II to George III ventured to interfere with colonial matters\r\npersonally, constant control over the colonies was exercised by royal\r\nofficers acting under the authority of the crown. Systematic supervision\r\nbegan in 1660, when there was created by royal order a committee of the\r\nking's council to meet on Mondays and Thursdays of each week to consider\r\npetitions, memorials, and addresses respecting the plantations. In 1696\r\na regular board was established, known as the \"Lords of Trade and\r\nPlantations,\" which continued, until the American Revolution, to\r\nscrutinize closely colonial business. The chief duties of the board were\r\nto examine acts of colonial legislatures, to recommend measures to those\r\nassemblies for adoption, and to hear memorials and petitions from the\r\ncolonies relative to their affairs.\r\n\r\nThe methods employed by this board were varied. All laws passed by\r\nAmerican legislatures came before it for review as a matter of routine.\r\nIf it found an act unsatisfactory, it recommended to the king the\r\nexercise of his veto power, known as the royal disallowance. Any person\r\nwho believed his personal or property rights injured by a colonial law\r\ncould be heard by the board in person or by attorney; in such cases it\r\nwas the practice to hear at the same time the agent of the colony so\r\ninvolved. The royal veto power over colonial legislation was not,\r\ntherefore, a formal affair, but was constantly employed on the\r\nsuggestion of a highly efficient agency of the crown. All this was in\r\naddition to the powers exercised by the governors in the royal\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\n=Judicial Control.=--Supplementing this administrative control over the\r\ncolonies was a constant supervision by the English courts of law. The\r\nking, by virtue of his inherent authority, claimed and exercised high\r\nappellate powers over all judicial tribunals in the empire. The right\r\nof appeal from local courts, expressly set forth in some charters, was,\r\non the eve of the Revolution, maintained in every colony. Any subject in\r\nEngland or America, who, in the regular legal course, was aggrieved by\r\nany act of a colonial legislature or any decision of a colonial court,\r\nhad the right, subject to certain regulations, to carry his case to the\r\nking in council, forcing his opponent to follow him across the sea. In\r\nthe exercise of appellate power, the king in council acting as a court\r\ncould, and frequently did, declare acts of colonial legislatures duly\r\nenacted and approved, null and void, on the ground that they were\r\ncontrary to English law.\r\n\r\n=Imperial Control in Operation.=--Day after day, week after week, year\r\nafter year, the machinery for political and judicial control over\r\ncolonial affairs was in operation. At one time the British governors in\r\nthe colonies were ordered not to approve any colonial law imposing a\r\nduty on European goods imported in English vessels. Again, when North\r\nCarolina laid a tax on peddlers, the council objected to it as\r\n\"restrictive upon the trade and dispersion of English manufactures\r\nthroughout the continent.\" At other times, Indian trade was regulated in\r\nthe interests of the whole empire or grants of lands by a colonial\r\nlegislature were set aside. Virginia was forbidden to close her ports to\r\nNorth Carolina lest there should be retaliation.\r\n\r\nIn short, foreign and intercolonial trade were subjected to a control\r\nhigher than that of the colony, foreshadowing a day when the\r\nConstitution of the United States was to commit to Congress the power to\r\nregulate interstate and foreign commerce and commerce with the Indians.\r\nA superior judicial power, towering above that of the colonies, as the\r\nSupreme Court at Washington now towers above the states, kept the\r\ncolonial legislatures within the metes and bounds of established law. In\r\nthe thousands of appeals, memorials, petitions, and complaints, and the\r\nrulings and decisions upon them, were written the real history of\r\nBritish imperial control over the American colonies.\r\n\r\nSo great was the business before the Lords of Trade that the colonies\r\nhad to keep skilled agents in London to protect their interests. As\r\ncommon grievances against the operation of this machinery of control\r\narose, there appeared in each colony a considerable body of men, with\r\nthe merchants in the lead, who chafed at the restraints imposed on their\r\nenterprise. Only a powerful blow was needed to weld these bodies into a\r\ncommon mass nourishing the spirit of colonial nationalism. When to the\r\nrepeated minor irritations were added general and sweeping measures of\r\nParliament applying to every colony, the rebound came in the Revolution.\r\n\r\n=Parliamentary Control over Colonial Affairs.=--As soon as Parliament\r\ngained in power at the expense of the king, it reached out to bring the\r\nAmerican colonies under its sway as well. Between the execution of\r\nCharles I and the accession of George III, there was enacted an immense\r\nbody of legislation regulating the shipping, trade, and manufactures of\r\nAmerica. All of it, based on the \"mercantile\" theory then prevalent in\r\nall countries of Europe, was designed to control the overseas\r\nplantations in such a way as to foster the commercial and business\r\ninterests of the mother country, where merchants and men of finance had\r\ngot the upper hand. According to this theory, the colonies of the\r\nBritish empire should be confined to agriculture and the production of\r\nraw materials, and forced to buy their manufactured goods of England.\r\n\r\n_The Navigation Acts._--In the first rank among these measures of\r\nBritish colonial policy must be placed the navigation laws framed for\r\nthe purpose of building up the British merchant marine and navy--arms so\r\nessential in defending the colonies against the Spanish, Dutch, and\r\nFrench. The beginning of this type of legislation was made in 1651 and\r\nit was worked out into a system early in the reign of Charles II\r\n(1660-85).\r\n\r\nThe Navigation Acts, in effect, gave a monopoly of colonial commerce to\r\nBritish ships. No trade could be carried on between Great Britain and\r\nher dominions save in vessels built and manned by British subjects. No\r\nEuropean goods could be brought to America save in the ships of the\r\ncountry that produced them or in English ships. These laws, which were\r\nalmost fatal to Dutch shipping in America, fell with severity upon the\r\ncolonists, compelling them to pay higher freight rates. The adverse\r\neffect, however, was short-lived, for the measures stimulated\r\nshipbuilding in the colonies, where the abundance of raw materials gave\r\nthe master builders of America an advantage over those of the mother\r\ncountry. Thus the colonists in the end profited from the restrictive\r\npolicy written into the Navigation Acts.\r\n\r\n_The Acts against Manufactures._--The second group of laws was\r\ndeliberately aimed to prevent colonial industries from competing too\r\nsharply with those of England. Among the earliest of these measures may\r\nbe counted the Woolen Act of 1699, forbidding the exportation of woolen\r\ngoods from the colonies and even the woolen trade between towns and\r\ncolonies. When Parliament learned, as the result of an inquiry, that New\r\nEngland and New York were making thousands of hats a year and sending\r\nlarge numbers annually to the Southern colonies and to Ireland, Spain,\r\nand Portugal, it enacted in 1732 a law declaring that \"no hats or felts,\r\ndyed or undyed, finished or unfinished\" should be \"put upon any vessel\r\nor laden upon any horse or cart with intent to export to any place\r\nwhatever.\" The effect of this measure upon the hat industry was almost\r\nruinous. A few years later a similar blow was given to the iron\r\nindustry. By an act of 1750, pig and bar iron from the colonies were\r\ngiven free entry to England to encourage the production of the raw\r\nmaterial; but at the same time the law provided that \"no mill or other\r\nengine for slitting or rolling of iron, no plating forge to work with a\r\ntilt hammer, and no furnace for making steel\" should be built in the\r\ncolonies. As for those already built, they were declared public\r\nnuisances and ordered closed. Thus three important economic interests of\r\nthe colonists, the woolen, hat, and iron industries, were laid under the\r\nban.\r\n\r\n_The Trade Laws._--The third group of restrictive measures passed by the\r\nBritish Parliament related to the sale of colonial produce. An act of\r\n1663 required the colonies to export certain articles to Great Britain\r\nor to her dominions alone; while sugar, tobacco, and ginger consigned to\r\nthe continent of Europe had to pass through a British port paying custom\r\nduties and through a British merchant's hands paying the usual\r\ncommission. At first tobacco was the only one of the \"enumerated\r\narticles\" which seriously concerned the American colonies, the rest\r\ncoming mainly from the British West Indies. In the course of time,\r\nhowever, other commodities were added to the list of enumerated\r\narticles, until by 1764 it embraced rice, naval stores, copper, furs,\r\nhides, iron, lumber, and pearl ashes. This was not all. The colonies\r\nwere compelled to bring their European purchases back through English\r\nports, paying duties to the government and commissions to merchants\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n_The Molasses Act._--Not content with laws enacted in the interest of\r\nEnglish merchants and manufacturers, Parliament sought to protect the\r\nBritish West Indies against competition from their French and Dutch\r\nneighbors. New England merchants had long carried on a lucrative trade\r\nwith the French islands in the West Indies and Dutch Guiana, where sugar\r\nand molasses could be obtained in large quantities at low prices. Acting\r\non the protests of English planters in the Barbadoes and Jamaica,\r\nParliament, in 1733, passed the famous Molasses Act imposing duties on\r\nsugar and molasses imported into the colonies from foreign\r\ncountries--rates which would have destroyed the American trade with the\r\nFrench and Dutch if the law had been enforced. The duties, however, were\r\nnot collected. The molasses and sugar trade with the foreigners went on\r\nmerrily, smuggling taking the place of lawful traffic.\r\n\r\n=Effect of the Laws in America.=--As compared with the strict monopoly\r\nof her colonial trade which Spain consistently sought to maintain, the\r\npolicy of England was both moderate and liberal. Furthermore, the\r\nrestrictive laws were supplemented by many measures intended to be\r\nfavorable to colonial prosperity. The Navigation Acts, for example,\r\nredounded to the advantage of American shipbuilders and the producers\r\nof hemp, tar, lumber, and ship stores in general. Favors in British\r\nports were granted to colonial producers as against foreign competitors\r\nand in some instances bounties were paid by England to encourage\r\ncolonial enterprise. Taken all in all, there is much justification in\r\nthe argument advanced by some modern scholars to the effect that the\r\ncolonists gained more than they lost by British trade and industrial\r\nlegislation. Certainly after the establishment of independence, when\r\nfree from these old restrictions, the Americans found themselves\r\nhandicapped by being treated as foreigners rather than favored traders\r\nand the recipients of bounties in English markets.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, it appears that the colonists felt little irritation\r\nagainst the mother country on account of the trade and navigation laws\r\nenacted previous to the close of the French and Indian war. Relatively\r\nfew were engaged in the hat and iron industries as compared with those\r\nin farming and planting, so that England's policy of restricting America\r\nto agriculture did not conflict with the interests of the majority of\r\nthe inhabitants. The woolen industry was largely in the hands of women\r\nand carried on in connection with their domestic duties, so that it was\r\nnot the sole support of any considerable number of people.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, moreover, the restrictive laws, especially those\r\nrelating to trade, were not rigidly enforced. Cargoes of tobacco were\r\nboldly sent to continental ports without even so much as a bow to the\r\nEnglish government, to which duties should have been paid. Sugar and\r\nmolasses from the French and Dutch colonies were shipped into New\r\nEngland in spite of the law. Royal officers sometimes protested against\r\nsmuggling and sometimes connived at it; but at no time did they succeed\r\nin stopping it. Taken all in all, very little was heard of \"the galling\r\nrestraints of trade\" until after the French war, when the British\r\ngovernment suddenly entered upon a new course.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE COLONIAL PERIOD\r\n\r\nIn the period between the landing of the English at Jamestown, Virginia,\r\nin 1607, and the close of the French and Indian war in 1763--a period of\r\na century and a half--a new nation was being prepared on this continent\r\nto take its place among the powers of the earth. It was an epoch of\r\nmigration. Western Europe contributed emigrants of many races and\r\nnationalities. The English led the way. Next to them in numerical\r\nimportance were the Scotch-Irish and the Germans. Into the melting pot\r\nwere also cast Dutch, Swedes, French, Jews, Welsh, and Irish. Thousands\r\nof negroes were brought from Africa to till Southern fields or labor as\r\ndomestic servants in the North.\r\n\r\nWhy did they come? The reasons are various. Some of them, the Pilgrims\r\nand Puritans of New England, the French Huguenots, Scotch-Irish and\r\nIrish, and the Catholics of Maryland, fled from intolerant governments\r\nthat denied them the right to worship God according to the dictates of\r\ntheir consciences. Thousands came to escape the bondage of poverty in\r\nthe Old World and to find free homes in America. Thousands, like the\r\nnegroes from Africa, were dragged here against their will. The lure of\r\nadventure appealed to the restless and the lure of profits to the\r\nenterprising merchants.\r\n\r\nHow did they come? In some cases religious brotherhoods banded together\r\nand borrowed or furnished the funds necessary to pay the way. In other\r\ncases great trading companies were organized to found colonies. Again it\r\nwas the wealthy proprietor, like Lord Baltimore or William Penn, who\r\nundertook to plant settlements. Many immigrants were able to pay their\r\nown way across the sea. Others bound themselves out for a term of years\r\nin exchange for the cost of the passage. Negroes were brought on account\r\nof the profits derived from their sale as slaves.\r\n\r\nWhatever the motive for their coming, however, they managed to get\r\nacross the sea. The immigrants set to work with a will. They cut down\r\nforests, built houses, and laid out fields. They founded churches,\r\nschools, and colleges. They set up forges and workshops. They spun and\r\nwove. They fashioned ships and sailed the seas. They bartered and\r\ntraded. Here and there on favorable harbors they established centers of\r\ncommerce--Boston, Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and\r\nCharleston. As soon as a firm foothold was secured on the shore line\r\nthey pressed westward until, by the close of the colonial period, they\r\nwere already on the crest of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\nThough they were widely scattered along a thousand miles of seacoast,\r\nthe colonists were united in spirit by many common ties. The major\r\nportion of them were Protestants. The language, the law, and the\r\nliterature of England furnished the basis of national unity. Most of the\r\ncolonists were engaged in the same hard task; that of conquering a\r\nwilderness. To ties of kinship and language were added ties created by\r\nnecessity. They had to unite in defense; first, against the Indians and\r\nlater against the French. They were all subjects of the same\r\nsovereign--the king of England. The English Parliament made laws for\r\nthem and the English government supervised their local affairs, their\r\ntrade, and their manufactures. Common forces assailed them. Common\r\ngrievances vexed them. Common hopes inspired them.\r\n\r\nMany of the things which tended to unite them likewise tended to throw\r\nthem into opposition to the British Crown and Parliament. Most of them\r\nwere freeholders; that is, farmers who owned their own land and tilled\r\nit with their own hands. A free soil nourished the spirit of freedom.\r\nThe majority of them were Dissenters, critics, not friends, of the\r\nChurch of England, that stanch defender of the British monarchy. Each\r\ncolony in time developed its own legislature elected by the voters; it\r\ngrew accustomed to making laws and laying taxes for itself. Here was a\r\npeople learning self-reliance and self-government. The attempts to\r\nstrengthen the Church of England in America and the transformation of\r\ncolonies into royal provinces only fanned the spirit of independence\r\nwhich they were designed to quench.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Americans owed much of their prosperity to the\r\nassistance of the government that irritated them. It was the protection\r\nof the British navy that prevented Holland, Spain, and France from\r\nwiping out their settlements. Though their manufacture and trade were\r\ncontrolled in the interests of the mother country, they also enjoyed\r\ngreat advantages in her markets. Free trade existed nowhere upon the\r\nearth; but the broad empire of Britain was open to American ships and\r\nmerchandise. It could be said, with good reason, that the disadvantages\r\nwhich the colonists suffered through British regulation of their\r\nindustry and trade were more than offset by the privileges they enjoyed.\r\nStill that is somewhat beside the point, for mere economic advantage is\r\nnot necessarily the determining factor in the fate of peoples. A\r\nthousand circumstances had helped to develop on this continent a nation,\r\nto inspire it with a passion for independence, and to prepare it for a\r\ndestiny greater than that of a prosperous dominion of the British\r\nempire. The economists, who tried to prove by logic unassailable that\r\nAmerica would be richer under the British flag, could not change the\r\nspirit of Patrick Henry, Samuel Adams, Benjamin Franklin, or George\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nG.L.

CONFLICT AND INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE NEW COURSE IN BRITISH IMPERIAL POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 25, 1760, King George II died and the British crown passed to\r\nhis young grandson. The first George, the son of the Elector of Hanover\r\nand Sophia the granddaughter of James I, was a thorough German who never\r\neven learned to speak the language of the land over which he reigned.\r\nThe second George never saw England until he was a man. He spoke English\r\nwith an accent and until his death preferred his German home. During\r\ntheir reign, the principle had become well established that the king did\r\nnot govern but acted only through ministers representing the majority in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE III AND HIS SYSTEM\r\n\r\n=The Character of the New King.=--The third George rudely broke the\r\nGerman tradition of his family. He resented the imputation that he was a\r\nforeigner and on all occasions made a display of his British sympathies.\r\nTo the draft of his first speech to Parliament, he added the popular\r\nphrase: \"Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of\r\nBriton.\" Macaulay, the English historian, certainly of no liking for\r\nhigh royal prerogative, said of George: \"The young king was a born\r\nEnglishman. All his tastes and habits, good and bad, were English. No\r\nportion of his subjects had anything to reproach him with.... His age,\r\nhis appearance, and all that was known of his character conciliated\r\npublic favor. He was in the bloom of youth; his person and address were\r\npleasing; scandal imputed to him no vice; and flattery might without\r\nglaring absurdity ascribe to him many princely virtues.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless George III had been spoiled by his mother, his tutors, and\r\nhis courtiers. Under their influence he developed high and mighty\r\nnotions about the sacredness of royal authority and his duty to check\r\nthe pretensions of Parliament and the ministers dependent upon it. His\r\nmother had dinned into his ears the slogan: \"George, be king!\" Lord\r\nBute, his teacher and adviser, had told him that his honor required him\r\nto take an active part in the shaping of public policy and the making of\r\nlaws. Thus educated, he surrounded himself with courtiers who encouraged\r\nhim in the determination to rule as well as reign, to subdue all\r\nparties, and to place himself at the head of the nation and empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\r\n\r\nGEORGE III]\r\n\r\n=Political Parties and George III.=--The state of the political parties\r\nfavored the plans of the king to restore some of the ancient luster of\r\nthe crown. The Whigs, who were composed mainly of the smaller\r\nfreeholders, merchants, inhabitants of towns, and Protestant\r\nnon-conformists, had grown haughty and overbearing through long\r\ncontinuance in power and had as a consequence raised up many enemies in\r\ntheir own ranks. Their opponents, the Tories, had by this time given up\r\nall hope of restoring to the throne the direct Stuart line; but they\r\nstill cherished their old notions about divine right. With the\r\naccession of George III the coveted opportunity came to them to rally\r\naround the throne again. George received his Tory friends with open\r\narms, gave them offices, and bought them seats in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n=The British Parliamentary System.=--The peculiarities of the British\r\nParliament at the time made smooth the way for the king and his allies\r\nwith their designs for controlling the entire government. In the first\r\nplace, the House of Lords was composed mainly of hereditary nobles whose\r\nnumber the king could increase by the appointment of his favorites, as\r\nof old. Though the members of the House of Commons were elected by\r\npopular vote, they did not speak for the mass of English people. Great\r\ntowns like Leeds, Manchester, and Birmingham, for example, had no\r\nrepresentatives at all. While there were about eight million inhabitants\r\nin Great Britain, there were in 1768 only about 160,000 voters; that is\r\nto say, only about one in every ten adult males had a voice in the\r\ngovernment. Many boroughs returned one or more members to the Commons\r\nalthough they had merely a handful of voters or in some instances no\r\nvoters at all. Furthermore, these tiny boroughs were often controlled by\r\nlords who openly sold the right of representation to the highest bidder.\r\nThe \"rotten-boroughs,\" as they were called by reformers, were a public\r\nscandal, but George III readily made use of them to get his friends into\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEORGE III'S MINISTERS AND THEIR COLONIAL POLICIES\r\n\r\n=Grenville and the War Debt.=--Within a year after the accession of\r\nGeorge III, William Pitt was turned out of office, the king treating him\r\nwith \"gross incivility\" and the crowds shouting \"Pitt forever!\" The\r\ndirection of affairs was entrusted to men enjoying the king's\r\nconfidence. Leadership in the House of Commons fell to George Grenville,\r\na grave and laborious man who for years had groaned over the increasing\r\ncost of government.\r\n\r\nThe first task after the conclusion of peace in 1763 was the adjustment\r\nof the disordered finances of the kingdom. The debt stood at the highest\r\npoint in the history of the country. More revenue was absolutely\r\nnecessary and Grenville began to search for it, turning his attention\r\nfinally to the American colonies. In this quest he had the aid of a\r\nzealous colleague, Charles Townshend, who had long been in public\r\nservice and was familiar with the difficulties encountered by royal\r\ngovernors in America. These two men, with the support of the entire\r\nministry, inaugurated in February, 1763, \"a new system of colonial\r\ngovernment. It was announced by authority that there were to be no more\r\nrequisitions from the king to the colonial assemblies for supplies, but\r\nthat the colonies were to be taxed instead by act of Parliament.\r\nColonial governors and judges were to be paid by the Crown; they were to\r\nbe supported by a standing army of twenty regiments; and all the\r\nexpenses of this force were to be met by parliamentary taxation.\"\r\n\r\n=Restriction of Paper Money (1763).=--Among the many complaints filed\r\nbefore the board of trade were vigorous protests against the issuance of\r\npaper money by the colonial legislatures. The new ministry provided a\r\nremedy in the act of 1763, which declared void all colonial laws\r\nauthorizing paper money or extending the life of outstanding bills. This\r\nlaw was aimed at the \"cheap money\" which the Americans were fond of\r\nmaking when specie was scarce--money which they tried to force on their\r\nEnglish creditors in return for goods and in payment of the interest and\r\nprincipal of debts. Thus the first chapter was written in the long\r\nbattle over sound money on this continent.\r\n\r\n=Limitation on Western Land Sales.=--Later in the same year (1763)\r\nGeorge III issued a royal proclamation providing, among other things,\r\nfor the government of the territory recently acquired by the treaty of\r\nParis from the French. One of the provisions in this royal decree\r\ntouched frontiersmen to the quick. The contests between the king's\r\nofficers and the colonists over the disposition of western lands had\r\nbeen long and sharp. The Americans chafed at restrictions on\r\nsettlement. The more adventurous were continually moving west and\r\n\"squatting\" on land purchased from the Indians or simply seized without\r\nauthority. To put an end to this, the king forbade all further purchases\r\nfrom the Indians, reserving to the crown the right to acquire such lands\r\nand dispose of them for settlement. A second provision in the same\r\nproclamation vested the power of licensing trade with the Indians,\r\nincluding the lucrative fur business, in the hands of royal officers in\r\nthe colonies. These two limitations on American freedom and enterprise\r\nwere declared to be in the interest of the crown and for the\r\npreservation of the rights of the Indians against fraud and abuses.\r\n\r\n=The Sugar Act of 1764.=--King George's ministers next turned their\r\nattention to measures of taxation and trade. Since the heavy debt under\r\nwhich England was laboring had been largely incurred in the defense of\r\nAmerica, nothing seemed more reasonable to them than the proposition\r\nthat the colonies should help to bear the burden which fell so heavily\r\nupon the English taxpayer. The Sugar Act of 1764 was the result of this\r\nreasoning. There was no doubt about the purpose of this law, for it was\r\nset forth clearly in the title: \"An act for granting certain duties in\r\nthe British colonies and plantations in America ... for applying the\r\nproduce of such duties ... towards defraying the expenses of defending,\r\nprotecting and securing the said colonies and plantations ... and for\r\nmore effectually preventing the clandestine conveyance of goods to and\r\nfrom the said colonies and plantations and improving and securing the\r\ntrade between the same and Great Britain.\" The old Molasses Act had been\r\nprohibitive; the Sugar Act of 1764 was clearly intended as a revenue\r\nmeasure. Specified duties were laid upon sugar, indigo, calico, silks,\r\nand many other commodities imported into the colonies. The enforcement\r\nof the Molasses Act had been utterly neglected; but this Sugar Act had\r\n\"teeth in it.\" Special precautions as to bonds, security, and\r\nregistration of ship masters, accompanied by heavy penalties, promised\r\na vigorous execution of the new revenue law.\r\n\r\nThe strict terms of the Sugar Act were strengthened by administrative\r\nmeasures. Under a law of the previous year the commanders of armed\r\nvessels stationed along the American coast were authorized to stop,\r\nsearch, and, on suspicion, seize merchant ships approaching colonial\r\nports. By supplementary orders, the entire British official force in\r\nAmerica was instructed to be diligent in the execution of all trade and\r\nnavigation laws. Revenue collectors, officers of the army and navy, and\r\nroyal governors were curtly ordered to the front to do their full duty\r\nin the matter of law enforcement. The ordinary motives for the discharge\r\nof official obligations were sharpened by an appeal to avarice, for\r\nnaval officers who seized offenders against the law were rewarded by\r\nlarge prizes out of the forfeitures and penalties.\r\n\r\n=The Stamp Act (1765).=--The Grenville-Townshend combination moved\r\nsteadily towards its goal. While the Sugar Act was under consideration\r\nin Parliament, Grenville announced a plan for a stamp bill. The next\r\nyear it went through both Houses with a speed that must have astounded\r\nits authors. The vote in the Commons stood 205 in favor to 49 against;\r\nwhile in the Lords it was not even necessary to go through the formality\r\nof a count. As George III was temporarily insane, the measure received\r\nroyal assent by a commission acting as a board of regency. Protests of\r\ncolonial agents in London were futile. \"We might as well have hindered\r\nthe sun's progress!\" exclaimed Franklin. Protests of a few opponents in\r\nthe Commons were equally vain. The ministry was firm in its course and\r\nfrom all appearances the Stamp Act hardly roused as much as a languid\r\ninterest in the city of London. In fact, it is recorded that the fateful\r\nmeasure attracted less notice than a bill providing for a commission to\r\nact for the king when he was incapacitated.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act, like the Sugar Act, declared the purpose of the British\r\ngovernment to raise revenue in America \"towards defraying the expenses\r\nof defending, protecting, and securing the British colonies and\r\nplantations in America.\" It was a long measure of more than fifty\r\nsections, carefully planned and skillfully drawn. By its provisions\r\nduties were imposed on practically all papers used in legal\r\ntransactions,--deeds, mortgages, inventories, writs, bail bonds,--on\r\nlicenses to practice law and sell liquor, on college diplomas, playing\r\ncards, dice, pamphlets, newspapers, almanacs, calendars, and\r\nadvertisements. The drag net was closely knit, for scarcely anything\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n=The Quartering Act (1765).=--The ministers were aware that the Stamp\r\nAct would rouse opposition in America--how great they could not\r\nconjecture. While the measure was being debated, a friend of General\r\nWolfe, Colonel Barré, who knew America well, gave them an ominous\r\nwarning in the Commons. \"Believe me--remember I this day told you so--\"\r\nhe exclaimed, \"the same spirit of freedom which actuated that people at\r\nfirst will accompany them still ... a people jealous of their liberties\r\nand who will vindicate them, if ever they should be violated.\" The\r\nanswer of the ministry to a prophecy of force was a threat of force.\r\nPreparations were accordingly made to dispatch a larger number of\r\nsoldiers than usual to the colonies, and the ink was hardly dry on the\r\nStamp Act when Parliament passed the Quartering Act ordering the\r\ncolonists to provide accommodations for the soldiers who were to enforce\r\nthe new laws. \"We have the power to tax them,\" said one of the ministry,\r\n\"and we will tax them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL RESISTANCE FORCES REPEAL\r\n\r\n=Popular Opposition.=--The Stamp Act was greeted in America by an\r\noutburst of denunciation. The merchants of the seaboard cities took the\r\nlead in making a dignified but unmistakable protest, agreeing not to\r\nimport British goods while the hated law stood upon the books. Lawyers,\r\nsome of them incensed at the heavy taxes on their operations and others\r\nintimidated by patriots who refused to permit them to use stamped\r\npapers, joined with the merchants. Aristocratic colonial Whigs, who had\r\nlong grumbled at the administration of royal governors, protested\r\nagainst taxation without their consent, as the Whigs had done in old\r\nEngland. There were Tories, however, in the colonies as in England--many\r\nof them of the official class--who denounced the merchants, lawyers, and\r\nWhig aristocrats as \"seditious, factious and republican.\" Yet the\r\nopposition to the Stamp Act and its accompanying measure, the Quartering\r\nAct, grew steadily all through the summer of 1765.\r\n\r\nIn a little while it was taken up in the streets and along the\r\ncountryside. All through the North and in some of the Southern colonies,\r\nthere sprang up, as if by magic, committees and societies pledged to\r\nresist the Stamp Act to the bitter end. These popular societies were\r\nknown as Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty: the former including\r\nartisans, mechanics, and laborers; and the latter, patriotic women. Both\r\ngroups were alike in that they had as yet taken little part in public\r\naffairs. Many artisans, as well as all the women, were excluded from the\r\nright to vote for colonial assemblymen.\r\n\r\nWhile the merchants and Whig gentlemen confined their efforts chiefly to\r\ndrafting well-phrased protests against British measures, the Sons of\r\nLiberty operated in the streets and chose rougher measures. They stirred\r\nup riots in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston when attempts\r\nwere made to sell the stamps. They sacked and burned the residences of\r\nhigh royal officers. They organized committees of inquisition who by\r\nthreats and intimidation curtailed the sale of British goods and the use\r\nof stamped papers. In fact, the Sons of Liberty carried their operations\r\nto such excesses that many mild opponents of the stamp tax were\r\nfrightened and drew back in astonishment at the forces they had\r\nunloosed. The Daughters of Liberty in a quieter way were making a very\r\neffective resistance to the sale of the hated goods by spurring on\r\ndomestic industries, their own particular province being the manufacture\r\nof clothing, and devising substitutes for taxed foods. They helped to\r\nfeed and clothe their families without buying British goods.\r\n\r\n=Legislative Action against the Stamp Act.=--Leaders in the colonial\r\nassemblies, accustomed to battle against British policies, supported the\r\npopular protest. The Stamp Act was signed on March 22, 1765. On May 30,\r\nthe Virginia House of Burgesses passed a set of resolutions declaring\r\nthat the General Assembly of the colony alone had the right to lay taxes\r\nupon the inhabitants and that attempts to impose them otherwise were\r\n\"illegal, unconstitutional, and unjust.\" It was in support of these\r\nresolutions that Patrick Henry uttered the immortal challenge: \"Cæsar\r\nhad his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell, and George III....\" Cries of\r\n\"Treason\" were calmly met by the orator who finished: \"George III may\r\nprofit by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATRICK HENRY]\r\n\r\n=The Stamp Act Congress.=--The Massachusetts Assembly answered the call\r\nof Virginia by inviting the colonies to elect delegates to a Congress to\r\nbe held in New York to discuss the situation. Nine colonies responded\r\nand sent representatives. The delegates, while professing the warmest\r\naffection for the king's person and government, firmly spread on record\r\na series of resolutions that admitted of no double meaning. They\r\ndeclared that taxes could not be imposed without their consent, given\r\nthrough their respective colonial assemblies; that the Stamp Act showed\r\na tendency to subvert their rights and liberties; that the recent trade\r\nacts were burdensome and grievous; and that the right to petition the\r\nking and Parliament was their heritage. They thereupon made \"humble\r\nsupplication\" for the repeal of the Stamp Act.\r\n\r\nThe Stamp Act Congress was more than an assembly of protest. It marked\r\nthe rise of a new agency of government to express the will of America.\r\nIt was the germ of a government which in time was to supersede the\r\ngovernment of George III in the colonies. It foreshadowed the Congress\r\nof the United States under the Constitution. It was a successful attempt\r\nat union. \"There ought to be no New England men,\" declared Christopher\r\nGadsden, in the Stamp Act Congress, \"no New Yorkers known on the\r\nContinent, but all of us Americans.\"\r\n\r\n=The Repeal of the Stamp Act and the Sugar Act.=--The effect of American\r\nresistance on opinion in England was telling. Commerce with the colonies\r\nhad been effectively boycotted by the Americans; ships lay idly swinging\r\nat the wharves; bankruptcy threatened hundreds of merchants in London,\r\nBristol, and Liverpool. Workingmen in the manufacturing towns of England\r\nwere thrown out of employment. The government had sown folly and was\r\nreaping, in place of the coveted revenue, rebellion.\r\n\r\nPerplexed by the storm they had raised, the ministers summoned to the\r\nbar of the House of Commons, Benjamin Franklin, the agent for\r\nPennsylvania, who was in London. \"Do you think it right,\" asked\r\nGrenville, \"that America should be protected by this country and pay no\r\npart of the expenses?\" The answer was brief: \"That is not the case; the\r\ncolonies raised, clothed, and paid during the last war twenty-five\r\nthousand men and spent many millions.\" Then came an inquiry whether the\r\ncolonists would accept a modified stamp act. \"No, never,\" replied\r\nFranklin, \"never! They will never submit to it!\" It was next suggested\r\nthat military force might compel obedience to law. Franklin had a ready\r\nanswer. \"They cannot force a man to take stamps.... They may not find a\r\nrebellion; they may, indeed, make one.\"\r\n\r\nThe repeal of the Stamp Act was moved in the House of Commons a few days\r\nlater. The sponsor for the repeal spoke of commerce interrupted, debts\r\ndue British merchants placed in jeopardy, Manchester industries closed,\r\nworkingmen unemployed, oppression instituted, and the loss of the\r\ncolonies threatened. Pitt and Edmund Burke, the former near the close\r\nof his career, the latter just beginning his, argued cogently in favor\r\nof retracing the steps taken the year before. Grenville refused.\r\n\"America must learn,\" he wailed, \"that prayers are not to be brought to\r\nCæsar through riot and sedition.\" His protests were idle. The Commons\r\nagreed to the repeal on February 22, 1766, amid the cheers of the\r\nvictorious majority. It was carried through the Lords in the face of\r\nstrong opposition and, on March 18, reluctantly signed by the king, now\r\nrestored to his right mind.\r\n\r\nIn rescinding the Stamp Act, Parliament did not admit the contention of\r\nthe Americans that it was without power to tax them. On the contrary, it\r\naccompanied the repeal with a Declaratory Act. It announced that the\r\ncolonies were subordinate to the crown and Parliament of Great Britain;\r\nthat the king and Parliament therefore had undoubted authority to make\r\nlaws binding the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and that the\r\nresolutions and proceedings of the colonists denying such authority were\r\nnull and void.\r\n\r\nThe repeal was greeted by the colonists with great popular\r\ndemonstrations. Bells were rung; toasts to the king were drunk; and\r\ntrade resumed its normal course. The Declaratory Act, as a mere paper\r\nresolution, did not disturb the good humor of those who again cheered\r\nthe name of King George. Their confidence was soon strengthened by the\r\nnews that even the Sugar Act had been repealed, thus practically\r\nrestoring the condition of affairs before Grenville and Townshend\r\ninaugurated their policy of \"thoroughness.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRESUMPTION OF BRITISH REVENUE AND COMMERCIAL POLICIES\r\n\r\n=The Townshend Acts (1767).=--The triumph of the colonists was brief.\r\nThough Pitt, the friend of America, was once more prime minister, and\r\nseated in the House of Lords as the Earl of Chatham, his severe illness\r\ngave to Townshend and the Tory party practical control over Parliament.\r\nUnconvinced by the experience with the Stamp Act, Townshend brought\r\nforward and pushed through both Houses of Parliament three measures,\r\nwhich to this day are associated with his name. First among his\r\nrestrictive laws was that of June 29, 1767, which placed the enforcement\r\nof the collection of duties and customs on colonial imports and exports\r\nin the hands of British commissioners appointed by the king, resident in\r\nthe colonies, paid from the British treasury, and independent of all\r\ncontrol by the colonists. The second measure of the same date imposed a\r\ntax on lead, glass, paint, tea, and a few other articles imported into\r\nthe colonies, the revenue derived from the duties to be applied toward\r\nthe payment of the salaries and other expenses of royal colonial\r\nofficials. A third measure was the Tea Act of July 2, 1767, aimed at the\r\ntea trade which the Americans carried on illegally with foreigners. This\r\nlaw abolished the duty which the East India Company had to pay in\r\nEngland on tea exported to America, for it was thought that English tea\r\nmerchants might thus find it possible to undersell American tea\r\nsmugglers.\r\n\r\n=Writs of Assistance Legalized by Parliament.=--Had Parliament been\r\ncontent with laying duties, just as a manifestation of power and right,\r\nand neglected their collection, perhaps little would have been heard of\r\nthe Townshend Acts. It provided, however, for the strict, even the\r\nharsh, enforcement of the law. It ordered customs officers to remain at\r\ntheir posts and put an end to smuggling. In the revenue act of June 29,\r\n1767, it expressly authorized the superior courts of the colonies to\r\nissue \"writs of assistance,\" empowering customs officers to enter \"any\r\nhouse, warehouse, shop, cellar, or other place in the British colonies\r\nor plantations in America to search for and seize\" prohibited or\r\nsmuggled goods.\r\n\r\nThe writ of assistance, which was a general search warrant issued to\r\nrevenue officers, was an ancient device hateful to a people who\r\ncherished the spirit of personal independence and who had made actual\r\ngains in the practice of civil liberty. To allow a \"minion of the law\"\r\nto enter a man's house and search his papers and premises, was too much\r\nfor the emotions of people who had fled to America in a quest for\r\nself-government and free homes, who had braved such hardships to\r\nestablish them, and who wanted to trade without official interference.\r\n\r\nThe writ of assistance had been used in Massachusetts in 1755 to prevent\r\nillicit trade with Canada and had aroused a violent hostility at that\r\ntime. In 1761 it was again the subject of a bitter controversy which\r\narose in connection with the application of a customs officer to a\r\nMassachusetts court for writs of assistance \"as usual.\" This application\r\nwas vainly opposed by James Otis in a speech of five hours' duration--a\r\nspeech of such fire and eloquence that it sent every man who heard it\r\naway \"ready to take up arms against writs of assistance.\" Otis denounced\r\nthe practice as an exercise of arbitrary power which had cost one king\r\nhis head and another his throne, a tyrant's device which placed the\r\nliberty of every man in jeopardy, enabling any petty officer to work\r\npossible malice on any innocent citizen on the merest suspicion, and to\r\nspread terror and desolation through the land. \"What a scene,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"does this open! Every man, prompted by revenge, ill-humor,\r\nor wantonness to inspect the inside of his neighbor's house, may get a\r\nwrit of assistance. Others will ask it from self-defense; one arbitrary\r\nexertion will provoke another until society is involved in tumult and\r\nblood.\" He did more than attack the writ itself. He said that Parliament\r\ncould not establish it because it was against the British constitution.\r\nThis was an assertion resting on slender foundation, but it was quickly\r\nechoed by the people. Then and there James Otis sounded the call to\r\nAmerica to resist the exercise of arbitrary power by royal officers.\r\n\"Then and there,\" wrote John Adams, \"the child Independence was born.\"\r\nSuch was the hated writ that Townshend proposed to put into the hands of\r\ncustoms officers in his grim determination to enforce the law.\r\n\r\n=The New York Assembly Suspended.=--In the very month that Townshend's\r\nActs were signed by the king, Parliament took a still more drastic step.\r\nThe assembly of New York, protesting against the \"ruinous and\r\ninsupportable\" expense involved, had failed to make provision for the\r\ncare of British troops in accordance with the terms of the Quartering\r\nAct. Parliament therefore suspended the assembly until it promised to\r\nobey the law. It was not until a third election was held that compliance\r\nwith the Quartering Act was wrung from the reluctant province. In the\r\nmeantime, all the colonies had learned on how frail a foundation their\r\nrepresentative bodies rested.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWED RESISTANCE IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n=The Massachusetts Circular (1768).=--Massachusetts, under the\r\nleadership of Samuel Adams, resolved to resist the policy of renewed\r\nintervention in America. At his suggestion the assembly adopted a\r\nCircular Letter addressed to the assemblies of the other colonies\r\ninforming them of the state of affairs in Massachusetts and roundly\r\ncondemning the whole British program. The Circular Letter declared that\r\nParliament had no right to lay taxes on Americans without their consent\r\nand that the colonists could not, from the nature of the case, be\r\nrepresented in Parliament. It went on shrewdly to submit to\r\nconsideration the question as to whether any people could be called free\r\nwho were subjected to governors and judges appointed by the crown and\r\npaid out of funds raised independently. It invited the other colonies,\r\nin the most temperate tones, to take thought about the common\r\npredicament in which they were all placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\r\n\r\nSAMUEL ADAMS]\r\n\r\n=The Dissolution of Assemblies.=--The governor of Massachusetts, hearing\r\nof the Circular Letter, ordered the assembly to rescind its appeal. On\r\nmeeting refusal, he promptly dissolved it. The Maryland, Georgia, and\r\nSouth Carolina assemblies indorsed the Circular Letter and were also\r\ndissolved at once. The Virginia House of Burgesses, thoroughly aroused,\r\npassed resolutions on May 16, 1769, declaring that the sole right of\r\nimposing taxes in Virginia was vested in its legislature, asserting anew\r\nthe right of petition to the crown, condemning the transportation of\r\npersons accused of crimes or trial beyond the seas, and beseeching the\r\nking for a redress of the general grievances. The immediate dissolution\r\nof the Virginia assembly, in its turn, was the answer of the royal\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\n=The Boston Massacre.=--American opposition to the British authorities\r\nkept steadily rising as assemblies were dissolved, the houses of\r\ncitizens searched, and troops distributed in increasing numbers among\r\nthe centers of discontent. Merchants again agreed not to import British\r\ngoods, the Sons of Liberty renewed their agitation, and women set about\r\nthe patronage of home products still more loyally.\r\n\r\nOn the night of March 5, 1770, a crowd on the streets of Boston began to\r\njostle and tease some British regulars stationed in the town. Things\r\nwent from bad to worse until some \"boys and young fellows\" began to\r\nthrow snowballs and stones. Then the exasperated soldiers fired into the\r\ncrowd, killing five and wounding half a dozen more. The day after the\r\n\"massacre,\" a mass meeting was held in the town and Samuel Adams was\r\nsent to demand the withdrawal of the soldiers. The governor hesitated\r\nand tried to compromise. Finding Adams relentless, the governor yielded\r\nand ordered the regulars away.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Massacre stirred the country from New Hampshire to Georgia.\r\nPopular passions ran high. The guilty soldiers were charged with murder.\r\nTheir defense was undertaken, in spite of the wrath of the populace, by\r\nJohn Adams and Josiah Quincy, who as lawyers thought even the worst\r\noffenders entitled to their full rights in law. In his speech to the\r\njury, however, Adams warned the British government against its course,\r\nsaying, that \"from the nature of things soldiers quartered in a populous\r\ntown will always occasion two mobs where they will prevent one.\" Two of\r\nthe soldiers were convicted and lightly punished.\r\n\r\n=Resistance in the South.=--The year following the Boston Massacre some\r\ncitizens of North Carolina, goaded by the conduct of the royal governor,\r\nopenly resisted his authority. Many were killed as a result and seven\r\nwho were taken prisoners were hanged as traitors. A little later royal\r\ntroops and local militia met in a pitched battle near Alamance River,\r\ncalled the \"Lexington of the South.\"\r\n\r\n=The _Gaspee_ Affair and the Virginia Resolutions of 1773.=--On sea as\r\nwell as on land, friction between the royal officers and the colonists\r\nbroke out into overt acts. While patrolling Narragansett Bay looking for\r\nsmugglers one day in 1772, the armed ship, _Gaspee_, ran ashore and was\r\ncaught fast. During the night several men from Providence boarded the\r\nvessel and, after seizing the crew, set it on fire. A royal commission,\r\nsent to Rhode Island to discover the offenders and bring them to\r\naccount, failed because it could not find a single informer. The very\r\nappointment of such a commission aroused the patriots of Virginia to\r\naction; and in March, 1773, the House of Burgesses passed a resolution\r\ncreating a standing committee of correspondence to develop coöperation\r\namong the colonies in resistance to British measures.\r\n\r\n=The Boston Tea Party.=--Although the British government, finding the\r\nTownshend revenue act a failure, repealed in 1770 all the duties except\r\nthat on tea, it in no way relaxed its resolve to enforce the other\r\ncommercial regulations it had imposed on the colonies. Moreover,\r\nParliament decided to relieve the British East India Company of the\r\nfinancial difficulties into which it had fallen partly by reason of the\r\nTea Act and the colonial boycott that followed. In 1773 it agreed to\r\nreturn to the Company the regular import duties, levied in England, on\r\nall tea transshipped to America. A small impost of three pence, to be\r\ncollected in America, was left as a reminder of the principle laid down\r\nin the Declaratory Act that Parliament had the right to tax the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement with the East India Company was obnoxious to the\r\ncolonists for several reasons. It was an act of favoritism for one\r\nthing, in the interest of a great monopoly. For another thing, it\r\npromised to dump on the American market, suddenly, an immense amount of\r\ncheap tea and so cause heavy losses to American merchants who had large\r\nstocks on hand. It threatened with ruin the business of all those who\r\nwere engaged in clandestine trade with the Dutch. It carried with it an\r\nirritating tax of three pence on imports. In Charleston, Annapolis, New\r\nYork, and Boston, captains of ships who brought tea under this act were\r\nroughly handled. One night in December, 1773, a band of Boston citizens,\r\ndisguised as Indians, boarded the hated tea ships and dumped the cargo\r\ninto the harbor. This was serious business, for it was open, flagrant,\r\ndetermined violation of the law. As such the British government viewed\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETALIATION BY THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n=Reception of the News of the Tea Riot.=--The news of the tea riot in\r\nBoston confirmed King George in his conviction that there should be no\r\nsoft policy in dealing with his American subjects. \"The die is cast,\" he\r\nstated with evident satisfaction. \"The colonies must either triumph or\r\nsubmit.... If we take the resolute part, they will undoubtedly be very\r\nmeek.\" Lord George Germain characterized the tea party as \"the\r\nproceedings of a tumultuous and riotous rabble who ought, if they had\r\nthe least prudence, to follow their mercantile employments and not\r\ntrouble themselves with politics and government, which they do not\r\nunderstand.\" This expressed, in concise form, exactly the sentiments of\r\nLord North, who had then for three years been the king's chief minister.\r\nEven Pitt, Lord Chatham, was prepared to support the government in\r\nupholding its authority.\r\n\r\n=The Five Intolerable Acts.=--Parliament, beginning on March 31, 1774,\r\npassed five stringent measures, known in American history as the five\r\n\"intolerable acts.\" They were aimed at curing the unrest in America. The\r\n_first_ of them was a bill absolutely shutting the port of Boston to\r\ncommerce with the outside world. The _second_, following closely,\r\nrevoked the Massachusetts charter of 1691 and provided furthermore that\r\nthe councilors should be appointed by the king, that all judges should\r\nbe named by the royal governor, and that town meetings (except to elect\r\ncertain officers) could not be held without the governor's consent. A\r\n_third_ measure, after denouncing the \"utter subversion of all lawful\r\ngovernment\" in the provinces, authorized royal agents to transfer to\r\nGreat Britain or to other colonies the trials of officers or other\r\npersons accused of murder in connection with the enforcement of the law.\r\nThe _fourth_ act legalized the quartering of troops in Massachusetts\r\ntowns. The _fifth_ of the measures was the Quebec Act, which granted\r\nreligious toleration to the Catholics in Canada, extended the boundaries\r\nof Quebec southward to the Ohio River, and established, in this western\r\nregion, government by a viceroy.\r\n\r\nThe intolerable acts went through Parliament with extraordinary\r\ncelerity. There was an opposition, alert and informed; but it was\r\nineffective. Burke spoke eloquently against the Boston port bill,\r\ncondemning it roundly for punishing the innocent with the guilty, and\r\nshowing how likely it was to bring grave consequences in its train. He\r\nwas heard with respect and his pleas were rejected. The bill passed both\r\nhouses without a division, the entry \"unanimous\" being made upon their\r\njournals although it did not accurately represent the state of opinion.\r\nThe law destroying the charter of Massachusetts passed the Commons by a\r\nvote of three to one; and the third intolerable act by a vote of four to\r\none. The triumph of the ministry was complete. \"What passed in Boston,\"\r\nexclaimed the great jurist, Lord Mansfield, \"is the overt act of High\r\nTreason proceeding from our over lenity and want of foresight.\" The\r\ncrown and Parliament were united in resorting to punitive measures.\r\n\r\nIn the colonies the laws were received with consternation. To the\r\nAmerican Protestants, the Quebec Act was the most offensive. That\r\nproject they viewed not as an act of grace or of mercy but as a direct\r\nattempt to enlist French Canadians on the side of Great Britain. The\r\nBritish government did not grant religious toleration to Catholics\r\neither at home or in Ireland and the Americans could see no good motive\r\nin granting it in North America. The act was also offensive because\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia had, under their charters,\r\nlarge claims in the territory thus annexed to Quebec.\r\n\r\nTo enforce these intolerable acts the military arm of the British\r\ngovernment was brought into play. The commander-in-chief of the armed\r\nforces in America, General Gage, was appointed governor of\r\nMassachusetts. Reinforcements were brought to the colonies, for now King\r\nGeorge was to give \"the rebels,\" as he called them, a taste of strong\r\nmedicine. The majesty of his law was to be vindicated by force.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM REFORM TO REVOLUTION IN AMERICA\r\n\r\n=The Doctrine of Natural Rights.=--The dissolution of assemblies, the\r\ndestruction of charters, and the use of troops produced in the colonies\r\na new phase in the struggle. In the early days of the contest with the\r\nBritish ministry, the Americans spoke of their \"rights as Englishmen\"\r\nand condemned the acts of Parliament as unlawful, as violating the\r\nprinciples of the English constitution under which they all lived. When\r\nthey saw that such arguments had no effect on Parliament, they turned\r\nfor support to their \"natural rights.\" The latter doctrine, in the form\r\nin which it was employed by the colonists, was as English as the\r\nconstitutional argument. John Locke had used it with good effect in\r\ndefense of the English revolution in the seventeenth century. American\r\nleaders, familiar with the writings of Locke, also took up his thesis in\r\nthe hour of their distress. They openly declared that their rights did\r\nnot rest after all upon the English constitution or a charter from the\r\ncrown. \"Old Magna Carta was not the beginning of all things,\" retorted\r\nOtis when the constitutional argument failed. \"A time may come when\r\nParliament shall declare every American charter void, but the natural,\r\ninherent, and inseparable rights of the colonists as men and as citizens\r\nwould remain and whatever became of charters can never be abolished\r\nuntil the general conflagration.\" Of the same opinion was the young and\r\nimpetuous Alexander Hamilton. \"The sacred rights of mankind,\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"are not to be rummaged for among old parchments or musty\r\nrecords. They are written as with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human\r\ndestiny by the hand of divinity itself, and can never be erased or\r\nobscured by mortal power.\"\r\n\r\nFirm as the American leaders were in the statement and defense of their\r\nrights, there is every reason for believing that in the beginning they\r\nhoped to confine the conflict to the realm of opinion. They constantly\r\navowed that they were loyal to the king when protesting in the strongest\r\nlanguage against his policies. Even Otis, regarded by the loyalists as a\r\nfirebrand, was in fact attempting to avert revolution by winning\r\nconcessions from England. \"I argue this cause with the greater\r\npleasure,\" he solemnly urged in his speech against the writs of\r\nassistance, \"as it is in favor of British liberty ... and as it is in\r\nopposition to a kind of power, the exercise of which in former periods\r\ncost one king of England his head and another his throne.\"\r\n\r\n=Burke Offers the Doctrine of Conciliation.=--The flooding tide of\r\nAmerican sentiment was correctly measured by one Englishman at least,\r\nEdmund Burke, who quickly saw that attempts to restrain the rise of\r\nAmerican democracy were efforts to reverse the processes of nature. He\r\nsaw how fixed and rooted in the nature of things was the American\r\nspirit--how inevitable, how irresistible. He warned his countrymen that\r\nthere were three ways of handling the delicate situation--and only\r\nthree. One was to remove the cause of friction by changing the spirit of\r\nthe colonists--an utter impossibility because that spirit was grounded\r\nin the essential circumstances of American life. The second was to\r\nprosecute American leaders as criminals; of this he begged his\r\ncountrymen to beware lest the colonists declare that \"a government\r\nagainst which a claim of liberty is tantamount to high treason is a\r\ngovernment to which submission is equivalent to slavery.\" The third and\r\nright way to meet the problem, Burke concluded, was to accept the\r\nAmerican spirit, repeal the obnoxious measures, and receive the colonies\r\ninto equal partnership.\r\n\r\n=Events Produce the Great Decision.=--The right way, indicated by Burke,\r\nwas equally impossible to George III and the majority in Parliament. To\r\ntheir narrow minds, American opinion was contemptible and American\r\nresistance unlawful, riotous, and treasonable. The correct way, in their\r\nview, was to dispatch more troops to crush the \"rebels\"; and that very\r\nact took the contest from the realm of opinion. As John Adams said:\r\n\"Facts are stubborn things.\" Opinions were unseen, but marching soldiers\r\nwere visible to the veriest street urchin. \"Now,\" said Gouverneur\r\nMorris, \"the sheep, simple as they are, cannot be gulled as heretofore.\"\r\nIt was too late to talk about the excellence of the British\r\nconstitution. If any one is bewildered by the controversies of modern\r\nhistorians as to why the crisis came at last, he can clarify his\r\nunderstanding by reading again Edmund Burke's stately oration, _On\r\nConciliation with America_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nG.L.

The\r\ncause of Massachusetts became the cause of all the colonies. Opposition\r\nto British policy, hitherto local and spasmodic, now took on a national\r\ncharacter. To local committees and provincial conventions was added a\r\nContinental Congress, appropriately called by Massachusetts on June 17,\r\n1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams. The response to the summons\r\nwas electric. By hurried and irregular methods delegates were elected\r\nduring the summer, and on September 5 the Congress duly assembled in\r\nCarpenter's Hall in Philadelphia. Many of the greatest men in America\r\nwere there--George Washington and Patrick Henry from Virginia and John\r\nand Samuel Adams from Massachusetts. Every shade of opinion was\r\nrepresented. Some were impatient with mild devices; the majority favored\r\nmoderation.\r\n\r\nThe Congress drew up a declaration of American rights and stated in\r\nclear and dignified language the grievances of the colonists. It\r\napproved the resistance to British measures offered by Massachusetts and\r\npromised the united support of all sections. It prepared an address to\r\nKing George and another to the people of England, disavowing the idea of\r\nindependence but firmly attacking the policies pursued by the British\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n=The Non-Importation Agreement.=--The Congress was not content, however,\r\nwith professions of faith and with petitions. It took one revolutionary\r\nstep. It agreed to stop the importation of British goods into America,\r\nand the enforcement of this agreement it placed in the hands of local\r\n\"committees of safety and inspection,\" to be elected by the qualified\r\nvoters. The significance of this action is obvious. Congress threw\r\nitself athwart British law. It made a rule to bind American citizens and\r\nto be carried into effect by American officers. It set up a state within\r\nthe British state and laid down a test of allegiance to the new order.\r\nThe colonists, who up to this moment had been wavering, had to choose\r\none authority or the other. They were for the enforcement of the\r\nnon-importation agreement or they were against it. They either bought\r\nEnglish goods or they did not. In the spirit of the toast--\"May Britain\r\nbe wise and America be free\"--the first Continental Congress adjourned\r\nin October, having appointed the tenth of May following for the meeting\r\nof a second Congress, should necessity require.\r\n\r\n=Lord North's \"Olive Branch.\"=--When the news of the action of the\r\nAmerican Congress reached England, Pitt and Burke warmly urged a repeal\r\nof the obnoxious laws, but in vain. All they could wring from the prime\r\nminister, Lord North, was a set of \"conciliatory resolutions\" proposing\r\nto relieve from taxation any colony that would assume its share of\r\nimperial defense and make provision for supporting the local officers of\r\nthe crown. This \"olive branch\" was accompanied by a resolution assuring\r\nthe king of support at all hazards in suppressing the rebellion and by\r\nthe restraining act of March 30, 1775, which in effect destroyed the\r\ncommerce of New England.\r\n\r\n=Bloodshed at Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775).=--Meanwhile the\r\nBritish authorities in Massachusetts relaxed none of their efforts in\r\nupholding British sovereignty. General Gage, hearing that military\r\nstores had been collected at Concord, dispatched a small force to seize\r\nthem. By this act he precipitated the conflict he had sought to avoid.\r\nAt Lexington, on the road to Concord, occurred \"the little thing\" that\r\nproduced \"the great event.\" An unexpected collision beyond the thought\r\nor purpose of any man had transferred the contest from the forum to the\r\nbattle field.\r\n\r\n=The Second Continental Congress.=--Though blood had been shed and war\r\nwas actually at hand, the second Continental Congress, which met at\r\nPhiladelphia in May, 1775, was not yet convinced that conciliation was\r\nbeyond human power. It petitioned the king to interpose on behalf of the\r\ncolonists in order that the empire might avoid the calamities of civil\r\nwar. On the last day of July, it made a temperate but firm answer to\r\nLord North's offer of conciliation, stating that the proposal was\r\nunsatisfactory because it did not renounce the right to tax or repeal\r\nthe offensive acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\n=Force, the British Answer.=--Just as the representatives of America\r\nwere about to present the last petition of Congress to the king on\r\nAugust 23, 1775, George III issued a proclamation of rebellion. This\r\nannouncement declared that the colonists, \"misled by dangerous and\r\nill-designing men,\" were in a state of insurrection; it called on the\r\ncivil and military powers to bring \"the traitors to justice\"; and it\r\nthreatened with \"condign punishment the authors, perpetrators, and\r\nabettors of such traitorous designs.\" It closed with the usual prayer:\r\n\"God, save the king.\" Later in the year, Parliament passed a sweeping\r\nact destroying all trade and intercourse with America. Congress was\r\nsilent at last. Force was also America's answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n=Drifting into War.=--Although the Congress had not given up all hope of\r\nreconciliation in the spring and summer of 1775, it had firmly resolved\r\nto defend American rights by arms if necessary. It transformed the\r\nmilitiamen who had assembled near Boston, after the battle of Lexington,\r\ninto a Continental army and selected Washington as commander-in-chief.\r\nIt assumed the powers of a government and prepared to raise money, wage\r\nwar, and carry on diplomatic relations with foreign countries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nSPIRIT OF 1776]\r\n\r\nEvents followed thick and fast. On June 17, the American militia, by\r\nthe stubborn defense of Bunker Hill, showed that it could make British\r\nregulars pay dearly for all they got. On July 3, Washington took command\r\nof the army at Cambridge. In January, 1776, after bitter disappointments\r\nin drumming up recruits for its army in England, Scotland, and Ireland,\r\nthe British government concluded a treaty with the Landgrave of\r\nHesse-Cassel in Germany contracting, at a handsome figure, for thousands\r\nof soldiers and many pieces of cannon. This was the crowning insult to\r\nAmerica. Such was the view of all friends of the colonies on both sides\r\nof the water. Such was, long afterward, the judgment of the conservative\r\nhistorian Lecky: \"The conduct of England in hiring German mercenaries to\r\nsubdue the essentially English population beyond the Atlantic made\r\nreconciliation hopeless and independence inevitable.\" The news of this\r\nwretched transaction in German soldiers had hardly reached America\r\nbefore there ran all down the coast the thrilling story that Washington\r\nhad taken Boston, on March 17, 1776, compelling Lord Howe to sail with\r\nhis entire army for Halifax.\r\n\r\n=The Growth of Public Sentiment in Favor of Independence.=--Events were\r\nbearing the Americans away from their old position under the British\r\nconstitution toward a final separation. Slowly and against their\r\ndesires, prudent and honorable men, who cherished the ties that united\r\nthem to the old order and dreaded with genuine horror all thought of\r\nrevolution, were drawn into the path that led to the great decision. In\r\nall parts of the country and among all classes, the question of the hour\r\nwas being debated. \"American independence,\" as the historian Bancroft\r\nsays, \"was not an act of sudden passion nor the work of one man or one\r\nassembly. It had been discussed in every part of the country by farmers\r\nand merchants, by mechanics and planters, by the fishermen along the\r\ncoast and the backwoodsmen of the West; in town meetings and from the\r\npulpit; at social gatherings and around the camp fires; in county\r\nconventions and conferences or committees; in colonial congresses and\r\nassemblies.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nTHOMAS PAINE]\r\n\r\n=Paine's \"Commonsense.\"=--In the midst of this ferment of American\r\nopinion, a bold and eloquent pamphleteer broke in upon the hesitating\r\npublic with a program for absolute independence, without fears and\r\nwithout apologies. In the early days of 1776, Thomas Paine issued the\r\nfirst of his famous tracts, \"Commonsense,\" a passionate attack upon the\r\nBritish monarchy and an equally passionate plea for American liberty.\r\nCasting aside the language of petition with which Americans had hitherto\r\naddressed George III, Paine went to the other extreme and assailed him\r\nwith many a violent epithet. He condemned monarchy itself as a system\r\nwhich had laid the world \"in blood and ashes.\" Instead of praising the\r\nBritish constitution under which colonists had been claiming their\r\nrights, he brushed it aside as ridiculous, protesting that it was \"owing\r\nto the constitution of the people, not to the constitution of the\r\ngovernment, that the Crown is not as oppressive in England as in\r\nTurkey.\"\r\n\r\nHaving thus summarily swept away the grounds of allegiance to the old\r\norder, Paine proceeded relentlessly to an argument for immediate\r\nseparation from Great Britain. There was nothing in the sphere of\r\npractical interest, he insisted, which should bind the colonies to the\r\nmother country. Allegiance to her had been responsible for the many wars\r\nin which they had been involved. Reasons of trade were not less weighty\r\nin behalf of independence. \"Our corn will fetch its price in any market\r\nin Europe and our imported goods must be paid for, buy them where we\r\nwill.\" As to matters of government, \"it is not in the power of Britain\r\nto do this continent justice; the business of it will soon be too\r\nweighty and intricate to be managed with any tolerable degree of\r\nconvenience by a power so distant from us and so very ignorant of us.\"\r\n\r\nThere is accordingly no alternative to independence for America.\r\n\"Everything that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of\r\nthe slain, the weeping voice of nature cries ''tis time to part.' ...\r\nArms, the last resort, must decide the contest; the appeal was the\r\nchoice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge.... The\r\nsun never shone on a cause of greater worth. 'Tis not the affair of a\r\ncity, a county, a province or a kingdom, but of a continent.... 'Tis not\r\nthe concern of a day, a year or an age; posterity is involved in the\r\ncontest and will be more or less affected to the end of time by the\r\nproceedings now. Now is the seed-time of Continental union, faith, and\r\nhonor.... O! ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose not only the\r\ntyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth.... Let names of Whig and Tory be\r\nextinct. Let none other be heard among us than those of a good citizen,\r\nan open and resolute friend, and a virtuous supporter of the rights of\r\nmankind and of the free and independent states of America.\" As more than\r\n100,000 copies were scattered broadcast over the country, patriots\r\nexclaimed with Washington: \"Sound doctrine and unanswerable reason!\"\r\n\r\n=The Drift of Events toward Independence.=--Official support for the\r\nidea of independence began to come from many quarters. On the tenth of\r\nFebruary, 1776, Gadsden, in the provincial convention of South Carolina,\r\nadvocated a new constitution for the colony and absolute independence\r\nfor all America. The convention balked at the latter but went half way\r\nby abolishing the system of royal administration and establishing a\r\ncomplete plan of self-government. A month later, on April 12, the\r\nneighboring state of North Carolina uttered the daring phrase from which\r\nothers shrank. It empowered its representatives in the Congress to\r\nconcur with the delegates of the other colonies in declaring\r\nindependence. Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Virginia quickly\r\nresponded to the challenge. The convention of the Old Dominion, on May\r\n15, instructed its delegates at Philadelphia to propose the independence\r\nof the United Colonies and to give the assent of Virginia to the act of\r\nseparation. When the resolution was carried the British flag on the\r\nstate house was lowered for all time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Continental Congress was alive to the course of events\r\noutside. The subject of independence was constantly being raised. \"Are\r\nwe rebels?\" exclaimed Wyeth of Virginia during a debate in February.\r\n\"No: we must declare ourselves a free people.\" Others hesitated and\r\nspoke of waiting for the arrival of commissioners of conciliation. \"Is\r\nnot America already independent?\" asked Samuel Adams a few weeks later.\r\n\"Why not then declare it?\" Still there was uncertainty and delegates\r\navoided the direct word. A few more weeks elapsed. At last, on May 10,\r\nCongress declared that the authority of the British crown in America\r\nmust be suppressed and advised the colonies to set up governments of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nTHOMAS JEFFERSON READING HIS DRAFT OF THE DECLARATION OF\r\nINDEPENDENCE TO THE COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS]\r\n\r\n=Independence Declared.=--The way was fully prepared, therefore, when,\r\non June 7, the Virginia delegation in the Congress moved that \"these\r\nunited colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent\r\nstates.\" A committee was immediately appointed to draft a formal\r\ndocument setting forth the reasons for the act, and on July 2 all the\r\nstates save New York went on record in favor of severing their political\r\nconnection with Great Britain. Two days later, July 4, Jefferson's draft\r\nof the Declaration of Independence, changed in some slight particulars,\r\nwas adopted. The old bell in Independence Hall, as it is now known, rang\r\nout the glad tidings; couriers swiftly carried the news to the uttermost\r\nhamlet and farm. A new nation announced its will to have a place among\r\nthe powers of the world.\r\n\r\nTo some documents is given immortality. The Declaration of Independence\r\nis one of them. American patriotism is forever associated with it; but\r\npatriotism alone does not make it immortal. Neither does the vigor of\r\nits language or the severity of its indictment give it a secure place in\r\nthe records of time. The secret of its greatness lies in the simple fact\r\nthat it is one of the memorable landmarks in the history of a political\r\nideal which for three centuries has been taking form and spreading\r\nthroughout the earth, challenging kings and potentates, shaking down\r\nthrones and aristocracies, breaking the armies of irresponsible power on\r\nbattle fields as far apart as Marston Moor and Château-Thierry. That\r\nideal, now so familiar, then so novel, is summed up in the simple\r\nsentence: \"Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\"\r\n\r\nWritten in a \"decent respect for the opinions of mankind,\" to set forth\r\nthe causes which impelled the American colonists to separate from\r\nBritain, the Declaration contained a long list of \"abuses and\r\nusurpations\" which had induced them to throw off the government of King\r\nGeorge. That section of the Declaration has passed into \"ancient\"\r\nhistory and is seldom read. It is the part laying down a new basis for\r\ngovernment and giving a new dignity to the common man that has become a\r\nhousehold phrase in the Old World as in the New.\r\n\r\nIn the more enduring passages there are four fundamental ideas which,\r\nfrom the standpoint of the old system of government, were the essence of\r\nrevolution: (1) all men are created equal and are endowed by their\r\nCreator with certain unalienable rights including life, liberty, and the\r\npursuit of happiness; (2) the purpose of government is to secure these\r\nrights; (3) governments derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned; (4) whenever any form of government becomes destructive of\r\nthese ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and\r\ninstitute new government, laying its foundations on such principles and\r\norganizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to\r\neffect their safety and happiness. Here was the prelude to the historic\r\ndrama of democracy--a challenge to every form of government and every\r\nprivilege not founded on popular assent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESTABLISHMENT OF GOVERNMENT AND THE NEW ALLEGIANCE\r\n\r\n=The Committees of Correspondence.=--As soon as debate had passed into\r\narmed resistance, the patriots found it necessary to consolidate their\r\nforces by organizing civil government. This was readily effected, for\r\nthe means were at hand in town meetings, provincial legislatures, and\r\ncommittees of correspondence. The working tools of the Revolution were\r\nin fact the committees of correspondence--small, local, unofficial\r\ngroups of patriots formed to exchange views and create public sentiment.\r\nAs early as November, 1772, such a committee had been created in Boston\r\nunder the leadership of Samuel Adams. It held regular meetings, sent\r\nemissaries to neighboring towns, and carried on a campaign of education\r\nin the doctrines of liberty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COLONIES OF NORTH AMERICA AT THE TIME OF THE\r\nDECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE]\r\n\r\nUpon local organizations similar in character to the Boston committee\r\nwere built county committees and then the larger colonial committees,\r\ncongresses, and conventions, all unofficial and representing the\r\nrevolutionary elements. Ordinarily the provincial convention was merely\r\nthe old legislative assembly freed from all royalist sympathizers and\r\ncontrolled by patriots. Finally, upon these colonial assemblies was\r\nbuilt the Continental Congress, the precursor of union under the\r\nArticles of Confederation and ultimately under the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States. This was the revolutionary government set up within the\r\nBritish empire in America.\r\n\r\n=State Constitutions Framed.=--With the rise of these new assemblies of\r\nthe people, the old colonial governments broke down. From the royal\r\nprovinces the governor, the judges, and the high officers fled in haste,\r\nand it became necessary to substitute patriot authorities. The appeal to\r\nthe colonies advising them to adopt a new form of government for\r\nthemselves, issued by the Congress in May, 1776, was quickly acted upon.\r\nBefore the expiration of a year, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Georgia, and New York had drafted new constitutions\r\nas states, not as colonies uncertain of their destinies. Connecticut and\r\nRhode Island, holding that their ancient charters were equal to their\r\nneeds, merely renounced their allegiance to the king and went on as\r\nbefore so far as the form of government was concerned. South Carolina,\r\nwhich had drafted a temporary plan early in 1776, drew up a new and more\r\ncomplete constitution in 1778. Two years later Massachusetts with much\r\ndeliberation put into force its fundamental law, which in most of its\r\nessential features remains unchanged to-day.\r\n\r\nThe new state constitutions in their broad outlines followed colonial\r\nmodels. For the royal governor was substituted a governor or president\r\nchosen usually by the legislature; but in two instances, New York and\r\nMassachusetts, by popular vote. For the provincial council there was\r\nsubstituted, except in Georgia, a senate; while the lower house, or\r\nassembly, was continued virtually without change. The old property\r\nrestriction on the suffrage, though lowered slightly in some states, was\r\ncontinued in full force to the great discontent of the mechanics thus\r\ndeprived of the ballot. The special qualifications, laid down in several\r\nconstitutions, for governors, senators, and representatives, indicated\r\nthat the revolutionary leaders were not prepared for any radical\r\nexperiments in democracy. The protests of a few women, like Mrs. John\r\nAdams of Massachusetts and Mrs. Henry Corbin of Virginia, against a\r\ngovernment which excluded them from political rights were treated as\r\nmild curiosities of no significance, although in New Jersey women were\r\nallowed to vote for many years on the same terms as men.\r\n\r\nBy the new state constitutions the signs and symbols of royal power, of\r\nauthority derived from any source save \"the people,\" were swept aside\r\nand republican governments on an imposing scale presented for the first\r\ntime to the modern world. Copies of these remarkable documents prepared\r\nby plain citizens were translated into French and widely circulated in\r\nEurope. There they were destined to serve as a guide and inspiration to\r\na generation of constitution-makers whose mission it was to begin the\r\ndemocratic revolution in the Old World.\r\n\r\n=The Articles of Confederation.=--The formation of state constitutions\r\nwas an easy task for the revolutionary leaders. They had only to build\r\non foundations already laid. The establishment of a national system of\r\ngovernment was another matter. There had always been, it must be\r\nremembered, a system of central control over the colonies, but Americans\r\nhad had little experience in its operation. When the supervision of the\r\ncrown of Great Britain was suddenly broken, the patriot leaders,\r\naccustomed merely to provincial statesmanship, were poorly trained for\r\naction on a national stage.\r\n\r\nMany forces worked against those who, like Franklin, had a vision of\r\nnational destiny. There were differences in economic interest--commerce\r\nand industry in the North and the planting system of the South. There\r\nwere contests over the apportionment of taxes and the quotas of troops\r\nfor common defense. To these practical difficulties were added local\r\npride, the vested rights of state and village politicians in their\r\nprovincial dignity, and the scarcity of men with a large outlook upon\r\nthe common enterprise.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, necessity compelled them to consider some sort of\r\nfederation. The second Continental Congress had hardly opened its work\r\nbefore the most sagacious leaders began to urge the desirability of a\r\npermanent connection. As early as July, 1775, Congress resolved to go\r\ninto a committee of the whole on the state of the union, and Franklin,\r\nundaunted by the fate of his Albany plan of twenty years before, again\r\npresented a draft of a constitution. Long and desultory debates followed\r\nand it was not until late in 1777 that Congress presented to the states\r\nthe Articles of Confederation. Provincial jealousies delayed\r\nratification, and it was the spring of 1781, a few months before the\r\nsurrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, when Maryland, the last of the\r\nstates, approved the Articles. This plan of union, though it was all\r\nthat could be wrung from the reluctant states, provided for neither a\r\nchief executive nor a system of federal courts. It created simply a\r\nCongress of delegates in which each state had an equal voice and gave it\r\nthe right to call upon the state legislatures for the sinews of\r\ngovernment--money and soldiers.\r\n\r\n=The Application of Tests of Allegiance.=--As the successive steps were\r\ntaken in the direction of independent government, the patriots devised\r\nand applied tests designed to discover who were for and who were against\r\nthe new nation in the process of making. When the first Continental\r\nCongress agreed not to allow the importation of British goods, it\r\nprovided for the creation of local committees to enforce the rules. Such\r\nagencies were duly formed by the choice of men favoring the scheme, all\r\nopponents being excluded from the elections. Before these bodies those\r\nwho persisted in buying British goods were summoned and warned or\r\npunished according to circumstances. As soon as the new state\r\nconstitutions were put into effect, local committees set to work in the\r\nsame way to ferret out all who were not outspoken in their support of\r\nthe new order of things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOBBING THE TORIES]\r\n\r\nThese patriot agencies, bearing different names in different sections,\r\nwere sometimes ruthless in their methods. They called upon all men to\r\nsign the test of loyalty, frequently known as the \"association test.\"\r\nThose who refused were promptly branded as outlaws, while some of the\r\nmore dangerous were thrown into jail. The prison camp in Connecticut at\r\none time held the former governor of New Jersey and the mayor of New\r\nYork. Thousands were black-listed and subjected to espionage. The\r\nblack-list of Pennsylvania contained the names of nearly five hundred\r\npersons of prominence who were under suspicion. Loyalists or Tories who\r\nwere bold enough to speak and write against the Revolution were\r\nsuppressed and their pamphlets burned. In many places, particularly in\r\nthe North, the property of the loyalists was confiscated and the\r\nproceeds applied to the cause of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe work of the official agencies for suppression of opposition was\r\nsometimes supplemented by mob violence. A few Tories were hanged without\r\ntrial, and others were tarred and feathered. One was placed upon a cake\r\nof ice and held there \"until his loyalty to King George might cool.\"\r\nWhole families were driven out of their homes to find their way as best\r\nthey could within the British lines or into Canada, where the British\r\ngovernment gave them lands. Such excesses were deplored by Washington,\r\nbut they were defended on the ground that in effect a civil war, as well\r\nas a war for independence, was being waged.\r\n\r\n=The Patriots and Tories.=--Thus, by one process or another, those who\r\nwere to be citizens of the new republic were separated from those who\r\npreferred to be subjects of King George. Just what proportion of the\r\nAmericans favored independence and what share remained loyal to the\r\nBritish monarchy there is no way of knowing. The question of revolution\r\nwas not submitted to popular vote, and on the point of numbers we have\r\nconflicting evidence. On the patriot side, there is the testimony of a\r\ncareful and informed observer, John Adams, who asserted that two-thirds\r\nof the people were for the American cause and not more than one-third\r\nopposed the Revolution at all stages.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the loyalists, or Tories as they were popularly known,\r\nextravagant claims were made. Joseph Galloway, who had been a member of\r\nthe first Continental Congress and had fled to England when he saw its\r\ntemper, testified before a committee of Parliament in 1779 that not\r\none-fifth of the American people supported the insurrection and that\r\n\"many more than four-fifths of the people prefer a union with Great\r\nBritain upon constitutional principles to independence.\" At the same\r\ntime General Robertson, who had lived in America twenty-four years,\r\ndeclared that \"more than two-thirds of the people would prefer the\r\nking's government to the Congress' tyranny.\" In an address to the king\r\nin that year a committee of American loyalists asserted that \"the number\r\nof Americans in his Majesty's army exceeded the number of troops\r\nenlisted by Congress to oppose them.\"\r\n\r\n=The Character of the Loyalists.=--When General Howe evacuated Boston,\r\nmore than a thousand people fled with him. This great company, according\r\nto a careful historian, \"formed the aristocracy of the province by\r\nvirtue of their official rank; of their dignified callings and\r\nprofessions; of their hereditary wealth and of their culture.\" The act\r\nof banishment passed by Massachusetts in 1778, listing over 300 Tories,\r\n\"reads like the social register of the oldest and noblest families of\r\nNew England,\" more than one out of five being graduates of Harvard\r\nCollege. The same was true of New York and Philadelphia; namely, that\r\nthe leading loyalists were prominent officials of the old order,\r\nclergymen and wealthy merchants. With passion the loyalists fought\r\nagainst the inevitable or with anguish of heart they left as refugees\r\nfor a life of uncertainty in Canada or the mother country.\r\n\r\n=Tories Assail the Patriots.=--The Tories who remained in America joined\r\nthe British army by the thousands or in other ways aided the royal\r\ncause. Those who were skillful with the pen assailed the patriots in\r\neditorials, rhymes, satires, and political catechisms. They declared\r\nthat the members of Congress were \"obscure, pettifogging attorneys,\r\nbankrupt shopkeepers, outlawed smugglers, etc.\" The people and their\r\nleaders they characterized as \"wretched banditti ... the refuse and\r\ndregs of mankind.\" The generals in the army they sneered at as \"men of\r\nrank and honor nearly on a par with those of the Congress.\"\r\n\r\n=Patriot Writers Arouse the National Spirit.=--Stung by Tory taunts,\r\npatriot writers devoted themselves to creating and sustaining a public\r\nopinion favorable to the American cause. Moreover, they had to combat\r\nthe depression that grew out of the misfortunes in the early days of the\r\nwar. A terrible disaster befell Generals Arnold and Montgomery in the\r\nwinter of 1775 as they attempted to bring Canada into the revolution--a\r\ndisaster that cost 5000 men; repeated calamities harassed Washington in\r\n1776 as he was defeated on Long Island, driven out of New York City, and\r\nbeaten at Harlem Heights and White Plains. These reverses were almost\r\ntoo great for the stoutest patriots.\r\n\r\nPamphleteers, preachers, and publicists rose, however, to meet the needs\r\nof the hour. John Witherspoon, provost of the College of New Jersey,\r\nforsook the classroom for the field of political controversy. The poet,\r\nPhilip Freneau, flung taunts of cowardice at the Tories and celebrated\r\nthe spirit of liberty in many a stirring poem. Songs, ballads, plays,\r\nand satires flowed from the press in an unending stream. Fast days,\r\nbattle anniversaries, celebrations of important steps taken by Congress\r\nafforded to patriotic clergymen abundant opportunities for sermons.\r\n\"Does Mr. Wiberd preach against oppression?\" anxiously inquired John\r\nAdams in a letter to his wife. The answer was decisive. \"The clergy of\r\nevery denomination, not excepting the Episcopalian, thunder and lighten\r\nevery Sabbath. They pray for Boston and Massachusetts. They thank God\r\nmost explicitly and fervently for our remarkable successes. They pray\r\nfor the American army.\"\r\n\r\nThomas Paine never let his pen rest. He had been with the forces of\r\nWashington when they retreated from Fort Lee and were harried from New\r\nJersey into Pennsylvania. He knew the effect of such reverses on the\r\narmy as well as on the public. In December, 1776, he made a second great\r\nappeal to his countrymen in his pamphlet, \"The Crisis,\" the first part\r\nof which he had written while defeat and gloom were all about him. This\r\ntract was a cry for continued support of the Revolution. \"These are the\r\ntimes that try men's souls,\" he opened. \"The summer soldier and the\r\nsunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink from the service of his\r\ncountry; but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men\r\nand women.\" Paine laid his lash fiercely on the Tories, branding every\r\none as a coward grounded in \"servile, slavish, self-interested fear.\" He\r\ndeplored the inadequacy of the militia and called for a real army. He\r\nrefuted the charge that the retreat through New Jersey was a disaster\r\nand he promised victory soon. \"By perseverance and fortitude,\" he\r\nconcluded, \"we have the prospect of a glorious issue; by cowardice and\r\nsubmission the sad choice of a variety of evils--a ravaged country, a\r\ndepopulated city, habitations without safety and slavery without\r\nhope.... Look on this picture and weep over it.\" His ringing call to\r\narms was followed by another and another until the long contest was\r\nover.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n=The Two Phases of the War.=--The war which opened with the battle of\r\nLexington, on April 19, 1775, and closed with the surrender of\r\nCornwallis at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, passed through two distinct\r\nphases--the first lasting until the treaty of alliance with France, in\r\n1778, and the second until the end of the struggle. During the first\r\nphase, the war was confined mainly to the North. The outstanding\r\nfeatures of the contest were the evacuation of Boston by the British,\r\nthe expulsion of American forces from New York and their retreat through\r\nNew Jersey, the battle of Trenton, the seizure of Philadelphia by the\r\nBritish (September, 1777), the invasion of New York by Burgoyne and his\r\ncapture at Saratoga in October, 1777, and the encampment of American\r\nforces at Valley Forge for the terrible winter of 1777-78.\r\n\r\nThe final phase of the war, opening with the treaty of alliance with\r\nFrance on February 6, 1778, was confined mainly to the Middle states,\r\nthe West, and the South. In the first sphere of action the chief events\r\nwere the withdrawal of the British from Philadelphia, the battle of\r\nMonmouth, and the inclosure of the British in New York by deploying\r\nAmerican forces from Morristown, New Jersey, up to West Point. In the\r\nWest, George Rogers Clark, by his famous march into the Illinois\r\ncountry, secured Kaskaskia and Vincennes and laid a firm grip on the\r\ncountry between the Ohio and the Great Lakes. In the South, the second\r\nperiod opened with successes for the British. They captured Savannah,\r\nconquered Georgia, and restored the royal governor. In 1780 they seized\r\nCharleston, administered a crushing defeat to the American forces under\r\nGates at Camden, and overran South Carolina, though meeting reverses at\r\nCowpens and King's Mountain. Then came the closing scenes. Cornwallis\r\nbegan the last of his operations. He pursued General Greene far into\r\nNorth Carolina, clashed with him at Guilford Court House, retired to the\r\ncoast, took charge of British forces engaged in plundering Virginia, and\r\nfortified Yorktown, where he was penned up by the French fleet from the\r\nsea and the combined French and American forces on land.\r\n\r\n=The Geographical Aspects of the War.=--For the British the theater of\r\nthe war offered many problems. From first to last it extended from\r\nMassachusetts to Georgia, a distance of almost a thousand miles. It was\r\nnearly three thousand miles from the main base of supplies and, though\r\nthe British navy kept the channel open, transports were constantly\r\nfalling prey to daring privateers and fleet American war vessels. The\r\nsea, on the other hand, offered an easy means of transportation between\r\npoints along the coast and gave ready access to the American centers of\r\nwealth and population. Of this the British made good use. Though early\r\nforced to give up Boston, they seized New York and kept it until the end\r\nof the war; they took Philadelphia and retained it until threatened by\r\nthe approach of the French fleet; and they captured and held both\r\nSavannah and Charleston. Wars, however, are seldom won by the conquest\r\nof cities.\r\n\r\nParticularly was this true in the case of the Revolution. Only a small\r\nportion of the American people lived in towns. Countrymen back from the\r\ncoast were in no way dependent upon them for a livelihood. They lived on\r\nthe produce of the soil, not upon the profits of trade. This very fact\r\ngave strength to them in the contest. Whenever the British ventured far\r\nfrom the ports of entry, they encountered reverses. Burgoyne was forced\r\nto surrender at Saratoga because he was surrounded and cut off from his\r\nbase of supplies. As soon as the British got away from Charleston, they\r\nwere harassed and worried by the guerrilla warriors of Marion, Sumter,\r\nand Pickens. Cornwallis could technically defeat Greene at Guilford far\r\nin the interior; but he could not hold the inland region he had invaded.\r\nSustained by their own labor, possessing the interior to which their\r\narmies could readily retreat, supplied mainly from native resources, the\r\nAmericans could not be hemmed in, penned up, and destroyed at one fell\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n=The Sea Power.=--The British made good use of their fleet in cutting\r\noff American trade, but control of the sea did not seriously affect the\r\nUnited States. As an agricultural country, the ruin of its commerce was\r\nnot such a vital matter. All the materials for a comfortable though\r\nsomewhat rude life were right at hand. It made little difference to a\r\nnation fighting for existence, if silks, fine linens, and chinaware were\r\ncut off. This was an evil to which submission was necessary.\r\n\r\nNor did the brilliant exploits of John Paul Jones and Captain John Barry\r\nmaterially change the situation. They demonstrated the skill of American\r\nseamen and their courage as fighting men. They raised the rates of\r\nBritish marine insurance, but they did not dethrone the mistress of the\r\nseas. Less spectacular, and more distinctive, were the deeds of the\r\nhundreds of privateers and minor captains who overhauled British supply\r\nships and kept British merchantmen in constant anxiety. Not until the\r\nFrench fleet was thrown into the scale, were the British compelled to\r\nreckon seriously with the enemy on the sea and make plans based upon the\r\npossibilities of a maritime disaster.\r\n\r\n=Commanding Officers.=--On the score of military leadership it is\r\ndifficult to compare the contending forces in the revolutionary contest.\r\nThere is no doubt that all the British commanders were men of experience\r\nin the art of warfare. Sir William Howe had served in America during the\r\nFrench War and was accounted an excellent officer, a strict\r\ndisciplinarian, and a gallant gentleman. Nevertheless he loved ease,\r\nsociety, and good living, and his expulsion from Boston, his failure to\r\noverwhelm Washington by sallies from his comfortable bases at New York\r\nand Philadelphia, destroyed every shred of his military reputation. John\r\nBurgoyne, to whom was given the task of penetrating New York from\r\nCanada, had likewise seen service in the French War both in America and\r\nEurope. He had, however, a touch of the theatrical in his nature and\r\nafter the collapse of his plans and the surrender of his army in 1777,\r\nhe devoted his time mainly to light literature. Sir Henry Clinton, who\r\ndirected the movement which ended in the capture of Charleston in 1780,\r\nhad \"learned his trade on the continent,\" and was regarded as a man of\r\ndiscretion and understanding in military matters. Lord Cornwallis, whose\r\nachievements at Camden and Guilford were blotted out by his surrender at\r\nYorktown, had seen service in the Seven Years' War and had undoubted\r\ntalents which he afterward displayed with great credit to himself in\r\nIndia. Though none of them, perhaps, were men of first-rate ability,\r\nthey all had training and experience to guide them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEORGE WASHINGTON]\r\n\r\nThe Americans had a host in Washington himself. He had long been\r\ninterested in military strategy and had tested his coolness under fire\r\nduring the first clashes with the French nearly twenty years before. He\r\nhad no doubts about the justice of his cause, such as plagued some of\r\nthe British generals. He was a stern but reasonable disciplinarian. He\r\nwas reserved and patient, little given to exaltation at success or\r\ndepression at reverses. In the dark hour of the Revolution, \"what held\r\nthe patriot forces together?\" asks Beveridge in his _Life of John\r\nMarshall_. Then he answers: \"George Washington and he alone. Had he\r\ndied or been seriously disabled, the Revolution would have ended....\r\nWashington was the soul of the American cause. Washington was the\r\ngovernment. Washington was the Revolution.\" The weakness of Congress in\r\nfurnishing men and supplies, the indolence of civilians, who lived at\r\nease while the army starved, the intrigues of army officers against him\r\nsuch as the \"Conway cabal,\" the cowardice of Lee at Monmouth, even the\r\ntreason of Benedict Arnold, while they stirred deep emotions in his\r\nbreast and aroused him to make passionate pleas to his countrymen, did\r\nnot shake his iron will or his firm determination to see the war through\r\nto the bitter end. The weight of Washington's moral force was\r\nimmeasurable.\r\n\r\nOf the generals who served under him, none can really be said to have\r\nbeen experienced military men when the war opened. Benedict Arnold, the\r\nunhappy traitor but brave and daring soldier, was a druggist, book\r\nseller, and ship owner at New Haven when the news of Lexington called\r\nhim to battle. Horatio Gates was looked upon as a \"seasoned soldier\"\r\nbecause he had entered the British army as a youth, had been wounded at\r\nBraddock's memorable defeat, and had served with credit during the Seven\r\nYears' War; but he was the most conspicuous failure of the Revolution.\r\nThe triumph over Burgoyne was the work of other men; and his crushing\r\ndefeat at Camden put an end to his military pretensions. Nathanael\r\nGreene was a Rhode Island farmer and smith without military experience\r\nwho, when convinced that war was coming, read Cæsar's _Commentaries_ and\r\ntook up the sword. Francis Marion was a shy and modest planter of South\r\nCarolina whose sole passage at arms had been a brief but desperate brush\r\nwith the Indians ten or twelve years earlier. Daniel Morgan, one of the\r\nheroes of Cowpens, had been a teamster with Braddock's army and had seen\r\nsome fighting during the French and Indian War, but his military\r\nknowledge, from the point of view of a trained British officer, was\r\nnegligible. John Sullivan was a successful lawyer at Durham, New\r\nHampshire, and a major in the local militia when duty summoned him to\r\nlay down his briefs and take up the sword. Anthony Wayne was a\r\nPennsylvania farmer and land surveyor who, on hearing the clash of arms,\r\nread a few books on war, raised a regiment, and offered himself for\r\nservice. Such is the story of the chief American military leaders, and\r\nit is typical of them all. Some had seen fighting with the French and\r\nIndians, but none of them had seen warfare on a large scale with regular\r\ntroops commanded according to the strategy evolved in European\r\nexperience. Courage, native ability, quickness of mind, and knowledge of\r\nthe country they had in abundance, and in battles such as were fought\r\nduring the Revolution all those qualities counted heavily in the\r\nbalance.\r\n\r\n=Foreign Officers in American Service.=--To native genius was added\r\nmilitary talent from beyond the seas. Baron Steuben, well schooled in\r\nthe iron régime of Frederick the Great, came over from Prussia, joined\r\nWashington at Valley Forge, and day after day drilled and manoeuvered the\r\nmen, laughing and cursing as he turned raw countrymen into regular\r\nsoldiers. From France came young Lafayette and the stern De Kalb, from\r\nPoland came Pulaski and Kosciusko;--all acquainted with the arts of war\r\nas waged in Europe and fitted for leadership as well as teaching.\r\nLafayette came early, in 1776, in a ship of his own, accompanied by\r\nseveral officers of wide experience, and remained loyally throughout the\r\nwar sharing the hardships of American army life. Pulaski fell at the\r\nsiege of Savannah and De Kalb at Camden. Kosciusko survived the American\r\nwar to defend in vain the independence of his native land. To these\r\ndistinguished foreigners, who freely threw in their lot with American\r\nrevolutionary fortunes, was due much of that spirit and discipline which\r\nfitted raw recruits and temperamental militiamen to cope with a military\r\npower of the first rank.\r\n\r\n=The Soldiers.=--As far as the British soldiers were concerned their\r\nannals are short and simple. The regulars from the standing army who\r\nwere sent over at the opening of the contest, the recruits drummed up\r\nby special efforts at home, and the thousands of Hessians bought\r\noutright by King George presented few problems of management to the\r\nBritish officers. These common soldiers were far away from home and\r\nenlisted for the war. Nearly all of them were well disciplined and many\r\nof them experienced in actual campaigns. The armies of King George\r\nfought bravely, as the records of Bunker Hill, Brandywine, and Monmouth\r\ndemonstrate. Many a man and subordinate officer and, for that matter,\r\nsome of the high officers expressed a reluctance at fighting against\r\ntheir own kin; but they obeyed orders.\r\n\r\nThe Americans, on the other hand, while they fought with grim\r\ndetermination, as men fighting for their homes, were lacking in\r\ndiscipline and in the experience of regular troops. When the war broke\r\nin upon them, there were no common preparations for it. There was no\r\ncontinental army; there were only local bands of militiamen, many of\r\nthem experienced in fighting but few of them \"regulars\" in the military\r\nsense. Moreover they were volunteers serving for a short time,\r\nunaccustomed to severe discipline, and impatient at the restraints\r\nimposed on them by long and arduous campaigns. They were continually\r\nleaving the service just at the most critical moments. \"The militia,\"\r\nlamented Washington, \"come in, you cannot tell how; go, you cannot tell\r\nwhere; consume your provisions; exhaust your stores; and leave you at\r\nlast at a critical moment.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again Washington begged Congress to provide for an army of\r\nregulars enlisted for the war, thoroughly trained and paid according to\r\nsome definite plan. At last he was able to overcome, in part at least,\r\nthe chronic fear of civilians in Congress and to wring from that\r\nreluctant body an agreement to grant half pay to all officers and a\r\nbonus to all privates who served until the end of the war. Even this\r\nscheme, which Washington regarded as far short of justice to the\r\nsoldiers, did not produce quick results. It was near the close of the\r\nconflict before he had an army of well-disciplined veterans capable of\r\nmeeting British regulars on equal terms.\r\n\r\nThough there were times when militiamen and frontiersmen did valiant and\r\neffective work, it is due to historical accuracy to deny the\r\ntime-honored tradition that a few minutemen overwhelmed more numerous\r\nforces of regulars in a seven years' war for independence. They did\r\nnothing of the sort. For the victories of Bennington, Trenton, Saratoga,\r\nand Yorktown there were the defeats of Bunker Hill, Long Island, White\r\nPlains, Germantown, and Camden. Not once did an army of militiamen\r\novercome an equal number of British regulars in an open trial by battle.\r\n\"To bring men to be well acquainted with the duties of a soldier,\" wrote\r\nWashington, \"requires time.... To expect the same service from raw and\r\nundisciplined recruits as from veteran soldiers is to expect what never\r\ndid and perhaps never will happen.\"\r\n\r\n=How the War Was Won.=--Then how did the American army win the war? For\r\none thing there were delays and blunders on the part of the British\r\ngenerals who, in 1775 and 1776, dallied in Boston and New York with\r\nlarge bodies of regular troops when they might have been dealing\r\nparalyzing blows at the scattered bands that constituted the American\r\narmy. \"Nothing but the supineness or folly of the enemy could have saved\r\nus,\" solemnly averred Washington in 1780. Still it is fair to say that\r\nthis apparent supineness was not all due to the British generals. The\r\nministers behind them believed that a large part of the colonists were\r\nloyal and that compromise would be promoted by inaction rather than by a\r\nwar vigorously prosecuted. Victory by masterly inactivity was obviously\r\nbetter than conquest, and the slighter the wounds the quicker the\r\nhealing. Later in the conflict when the seasoned forces of France were\r\nthrown into the scale, the Americans themselves had learned many things\r\nabout the practical conduct of campaigns. All along, the British were\r\nembarrassed by the problem of supplies. Their troops could not forage\r\nwith the skill of militiamen, as they were in unfamiliar territory. The\r\nlong oversea voyages were uncertain at best and doubly so when the\r\nwarships of France joined the American privateers in preying on supply\r\nboats.\r\n\r\nThe British were in fact battered and worn down by a guerrilla war and\r\noutdone on two important occasions by superior forces--at Saratoga and\r\nYorktown. Stern facts convinced them finally that an immense army, which\r\ncould be raised only by a supreme effort, would be necessary to subdue\r\nthe colonies if that hazardous enterprise could be accomplished at all.\r\nThey learned also that America would then be alienated, fretful, and the\r\nscene of endless uprisings calling for an army of occupation. That was a\r\nprice which staggered even Lord North and George III. Moreover, there\r\nwere forces of opposition at home with which they had to reckon.\r\n\r\n=Women and the War.=--At no time were the women of America indifferent\r\nto the struggle for independence. When it was confined to the realm of\r\nopinion they did their part in creating public sentiment. Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nTimothee, for example, founded in Charleston, in 1773, a newspaper to\r\nespouse the cause of the province. Far to the north the sister of James\r\nOtis, Mrs. Mercy Warren, early begged her countrymen to rest their case\r\nupon their natural rights, and in influential circles she urged the\r\nleaders to stand fast by their principles. While John Adams was tossing\r\nabout with uncertainty at the Continental Congress, his wife was writing\r\nletters to him declaring her faith in \"independency.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the war came down upon the country, women helped in every field. In\r\nsustaining public sentiment they were active. Mrs. Warren with a\r\ntireless pen combatted loyalist propaganda in many a drama and satire.\r\nAlmost every revolutionary leader had a wife or daughter who rendered\r\nservice in the \"second line of defense.\" Mrs. Washington managed the\r\nplantation while the General was at the front and went north to face the\r\nrigors of the awful winter at Valley Forge--an inspiration to her\r\nhusband and his men. The daughter of Benjamin Franklin, Mrs. Sarah\r\nBache, while her father was pleading the American cause in France, set\r\nthe women of Pennsylvania to work sewing and collecting supplies. Even\r\nnear the firing line women were to be found, aiding the wounded, hauling\r\npowder to the front, and carrying dispatches at the peril of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nIn the economic sphere, the work of women was invaluable. They harvested\r\ncrops without enjoying the picturesque title of \"farmerettes\" and they\r\ncanned and preserved for the wounded and the prisoners of war. Of their\r\nlabor in spinning and weaving it is recorded: \"Immediately on being cut\r\noff from the use of English manufactures, the women engaged within their\r\nown families in manufacturing various kinds of cloth for domestic use.\r\nThey thus kept their households decently clad and the surplus of their\r\nlabors they sold to such as chose to buy rather than make for\r\nthemselves. In this way the female part of families by their industry\r\nand strict economy frequently supported the whole domestic circle,\r\nevincing the strength of their attachment and the value of their\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nFor their war work, women were commended by high authorities on more\r\nthan one occasion. They were given medals and public testimonials even\r\nas in our own day. Washington thanked them for their labors and paid\r\ntribute to them for the inspiration and material aid which they had\r\ngiven to the cause of independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCES OF THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution opened, there were thirteen little treasuries in\r\nAmerica but no common treasury, and from first to last the Congress was\r\nin the position of a beggar rather than a sovereign. Having no authority\r\nto lay and collect taxes directly and knowing the hatred of the\r\nprovincials for taxation, it resorted mainly to loans and paper money to\r\nfinance the war. \"Do you think,\" boldly inquired one of the delegates,\r\n\"that I will consent to load my constituents with taxes when we can send\r\nto the printer and get a wagon load of money, one quire of which will\r\npay for the whole?\"\r\n\r\n=Paper Money and Loans.=--Acting on this curious but appealing political\r\neconomy, Congress issued in June, 1776, two million dollars in bills of\r\ncredit to be redeemed by the states on the basis of their respective\r\npopulations. Other issues followed in quick succession. In all about\r\n$241,000,000 of continental paper was printed, to which the several\r\nstates added nearly $210,000,000 of their own notes. Then came\r\ninterest-bearing bonds in ever increasing quantities. Several millions\r\nwere also borrowed from France and small sums from Holland and Spain. In\r\ndesperation a national lottery was held, producing meager results. The\r\nproperty of Tories was confiscated and sold, bringing in about\r\n$16,000,000. Begging letters were sent to the states asking them to\r\nraise revenues for the continental treasury, but the states, burdened\r\nwith their own affairs, gave little heed.\r\n\r\n=Inflation and Depreciation.=--As paper money flowed from the press, it\r\nrapidly declined in purchasing power until in 1779 a dollar was worth\r\nonly two or three cents in gold or silver. Attempts were made by\r\nCongress and the states to compel people to accept the notes at face\r\nvalue; but these were like attempts to make water flow uphill.\r\nSpeculators collected at once to fatten on the calamities of the\r\nrepublic. Fortunes were made and lost gambling on the prices of public\r\nsecurities while the patriot army, half clothed, was freezing at Valley\r\nForge. \"Speculation, peculation, engrossing, forestalling,\" exclaimed\r\nWashington, \"afford too many melancholy proofs of the decay of public\r\nvirtue. Nothing, I am convinced, but the depreciation of our currency\r\n... aided by stock jobbing and party dissensions has fed the hopes of\r\nthe enemy.\"\r\n\r\n=The Patriot Financiers.=--To the efforts of Congress in financing the\r\nwar were added the labors of private citizens. Hayn Solomon, a merchant\r\nof Philadelphia, supplied members of Congress, including Madison,\r\nJefferson, and Monroe, and army officers, like Lee and Steuben, with\r\nmoney for their daily needs. All together he contributed the huge sum of\r\nhalf a million dollars to the American cause and died broken in purse,\r\nif not in spirit, a British prisoner of war. Another Philadelphia\r\nmerchant, Robert Morris, won for himself the name of the \"patriot\r\nfinancier\" because he labored night and day to find the money to meet\r\nthe bills which poured in upon the bankrupt government. When his own\r\nfunds were exhausted, he borrowed from his friends. Experienced in the\r\nhandling of merchandise, he created agencies at important points to\r\ndistribute supplies to the troops, thus displaying administrative as\r\nwell as financial talents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT MORRIS]\r\n\r\nWomen organized \"drives\" for money, contributed their plate and their\r\njewels, and collected from door to door. Farmers took worthless paper in\r\nreturn for their produce, and soldiers saw many a pay day pass without\r\nyielding them a penny. Thus by the labors and sacrifices of citizens,\r\nthe issuance of paper money, lotteries, the floating of loans,\r\nborrowings in Europe, and the impressment of supplies, the Congress\r\nstaggered through the Revolution like a pauper who knows not how his\r\nnext meal is to be secured but is continuously relieved at a crisis by a\r\nkindly fate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DIPLOMACY OF THE REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nWhen the full measure of honor is given to the soldiers and sailors and\r\ntheir commanding officers, the civilians who managed finances and\r\nsupplies, the writers who sustained the American spirit, and the women\r\nwho did well their part, there yet remains the duty of recognizing the\r\nachievements of diplomacy. The importance of this field of activity was\r\nkeenly appreciated by the leaders in the Continental Congress. They were\r\nfairly well versed in European history. They knew of the balance of\r\npower and the sympathies, interests, and prejudices of nations and their\r\nrulers. All this information they turned to good account, in opening\r\nrelations with continental countries and seeking money, supplies, and\r\neven military assistance. For the transaction of this delicate business,\r\nthey created a secret committee on foreign correspondence as early as\r\n1775 and prepared to send agents abroad.\r\n\r\n=American Agents Sent Abroad.=--Having heard that France was inclining a\r\nfriendly ear to the American cause, the Congress, in March, 1776, sent a\r\ncommissioner to Paris, Silas Deane of Connecticut, often styled the\r\n\"first American diplomat.\" Later in the year a form of treaty to be\r\npresented to foreign powers was drawn up, and Franklin, Arthur Lee, and\r\nDeane were selected as American representatives at the court of \"His\r\nMost Christian Majesty the King of France.\" John Jay of New York was\r\nchosen minister to Spain in 1779; John Adams was sent to Holland the\r\nsame year; and other agents were dispatched to Florence, Vienna, and\r\nBerlin. The representative selected for St. Petersburg spent two\r\nfruitless years there, \"ignored by the court, living in obscurity and\r\nexperiencing nothing but humiliation and failure.\" Frederick the Great,\r\nking of Prussia, expressed a desire to find in America a market for\r\nSilesian linens and woolens, but, fearing England's command of the sea,\r\nhe refused to give direct aid to the Revolutionary cause.\r\n\r\n=Early French Interest.=--The great diplomatic triumph of the Revolution\r\nwas won at Paris, and Benjamin Franklin was the hero of the occasion,\r\nalthough many circumstances prepared the way for his success. Louis\r\nXVI's foreign minister, Count de Vergennes, before the arrival of any\r\nAmerican representative, had brought to the attention of the king the\r\nopportunity offered by the outbreak of the war between England and her\r\ncolonies. He showed him how France could redress her grievances and\r\n\"reduce the power and greatness of England\"--the empire that in 1763 had\r\nforced upon her a humiliating peace \"at the price of our possessions,\r\nof our commerce, and our credit in the Indies, at the price of Canada,\r\nLouisiana, Isle Royale, Acadia, and Senegal.\" Equally successful in\r\ngaining the king's interest was a curious French adventurer,\r\nBeaumarchais, a man of wealth, a lover of music, and the author of two\r\npopular plays, \"Figaro\" and \"The Barber of Seville.\" These two men had\r\nalready urged upon the king secret aid for America before Deane appeared\r\non the scene. Shortly after his arrival they made confidential\r\narrangements to furnish money, clothing, powder, and other supplies to\r\nthe struggling colonies, although official requests for them were\r\nofficially refused by the French government.\r\n\r\n=Franklin at Paris.=--When Franklin reached Paris, he was received only\r\nin private by the king's minister, Vergennes. The French people,\r\nhowever, made manifest their affection for the \"plain republican\" in\r\n\"his full dress suit of spotted Manchester velvet.\" He was known among\r\nmen of letters as an author, a scientist, and a philosopher of\r\nextraordinary ability. His \"Poor Richard\" had thrice been translated\r\ninto French and was scattered in numerous editions throughout the\r\nkingdom. People of all ranks--ministers, ladies at court, philosophers,\r\npeasants, and stable boys--knew of Franklin and wished him success in\r\nhis mission. The queen, Marie Antoinette, fated to lose her head in a\r\nrevolution soon to follow, played with fire by encouraging \"our dear\r\nrepublican.\"\r\n\r\nFor the king of France, however, this was more serious business. England\r\nresented the presence of this \"traitor\" in Paris, and Louis had to be\r\ncautious about plunging into another war that might also end\r\ndisastrously. Moreover, the early period of Franklin's sojourn in Paris\r\nwas a dark hour for the American Revolution. Washington's brilliant\r\nexploit at Trenton on Christmas night, 1776, and the battle with\r\nCornwallis at Princeton had been followed by the disaster at Brandywine,\r\nthe loss of Philadelphia, the defeat at Germantown, and the retirement\r\nto Valley Forge for the winter of 1777-78. New York City and\r\nPhiladelphia--two strategic ports--were in British hands; the Hudson\r\nand Delaware rivers were blocked; and General Burgoyne with his British\r\ntroops was on his way down through the heart of northern New York,\r\ncutting New England off from the rest of the colonies. No wonder the\r\nking was cautious. Then the unexpected happened. Burgoyne, hemmed in\r\nfrom all sides by the American forces, his flanks harried, his foraging\r\nparties beaten back, his supplies cut off, surrendered on October 17,\r\n1777, to General Gates, who had superseded General Schuyler in time to\r\nreceive the honor.\r\n\r\n=Treaties of Alliance and Commerce (1778).=--News of this victory,\r\nplaced by historians among the fifteen decisive battles of the world,\r\nreached Franklin one night early in December while he and some friends\r\nsat gloomily at dinner. Beaumarchais, who was with him, grasped at once\r\nthe meaning of the situation and set off to the court at Versailles with\r\nsuch haste that he upset his coach and dislocated his arm. The king and\r\nhis ministers were at last convinced that the hour had come to aid the\r\nRevolution. Treaties of commerce and alliance were drawn up and signed\r\nin February, 1778. The independence of the United States was recognized\r\nby France and an alliance was formed to guarantee that independence.\r\nCombined military action was agreed upon and Louis then formally\r\ndeclared war on England. Men who had, a few short years before, fought\r\none another in the wilderness of Pennsylvania or on the Plains of\r\nAbraham, were now ranged side by side in a war on the Empire that Pitt\r\nhad erected and that George III was pulling down.\r\n\r\n=Spain and Holland Involved.=--Within a few months, Spain, remembering\r\nthe steady decline of her sea power since the days of the Armada and\r\nhoping to drive the British out of Gibraltar, once more joined the\r\nconcert of nations against England. Holland, a member of a league of\r\narmed neutrals formed in protest against British searches on the high\r\nseas, sent her fleet to unite with the forces of Spain, France, and\r\nAmerica to prey upon British commerce. To all this trouble for England\r\nwas added the danger of a possible revolt in Ireland, where the spirit\r\nof independence was flaming up.\r\n\r\n=The British Offer Terms to America.=--Seeing the colonists about to be\r\njoined by France in a common war on the English empire, Lord North\r\nproposed, in February, 1778, a renewal of negotiations. By solemn\r\nenactment, Parliament declared its intention not to exercise the right\r\nof imposing taxes within the colonies; at the same time it authorized\r\nthe opening of negotiations through commissioners to be sent to America.\r\nA truce was to be established, pardons granted, objectionable laws\r\nsuspended, and the old imperial constitution, as it stood before the\r\nopening of hostilities, restored to full vigor. It was too late. Events\r\nhad taken the affairs of America out of the hands of British\r\ncommissioners and diplomats.\r\n\r\n=Effects of French Aid.=--The French alliance brought ships of war,\r\nlarge sums of gold and silver, loads of supplies, and a considerable\r\nbody of trained soldiers to the aid of the Americans. Timely as was this\r\nhelp, it meant no sudden change in the fortunes of war. The British\r\nevacuated Philadelphia in the summer following the alliance, and\r\nWashington's troops were encouraged to come out of Valley Forge. They\r\ninflicted a heavy blow on the British at Monmouth, but the treasonable\r\nconduct of General Charles Lee prevented a triumph. The recovery of\r\nPhiladelphia was offset by the treason of Benedict Arnold, the loss of\r\nSavannah and Charleston (1780), and the defeat of Gates at Camden.\r\n\r\nThe full effect of the French alliance was not felt until 1781, when\r\nCornwallis went into Virginia and settled at Yorktown. Accompanied by\r\nFrench troops Washington swept rapidly southward and penned the British\r\nto the shore while a powerful French fleet shut off their escape by sea.\r\nIt was this movement, which certainly could not have been executed\r\nwithout French aid, that put an end to all chance of restoring British\r\ndominion in America. It was the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown that\r\ncaused Lord North to pace the floor and cry out: \"It is all over! It is\r\nall over!\" What might have been done without the French alliance lies\r\nhidden from mankind. What was accomplished with the help of French\r\nsoldiers, sailors, officers, money, and supplies, is known to all the\r\nearth. \"All the world agree,\" exultantly wrote Franklin from Paris to\r\nGeneral Washington, \"that no expedition was ever better planned or\r\nbetter executed. It brightens the glory that must accompany your name to\r\nthe latest posterity.\" Diplomacy as well as martial valor had its\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACE AT LAST\r\n\r\n=British Opposition to the War.=--In measuring the forces that led to\r\nthe final discomfiture of King George and Lord North, it is necessary to\r\nremember that from the beginning to the end the British ministry at home\r\nfaced a powerful, informed, and relentless opposition. There were\r\nvigorous protests, first against the obnoxious acts which precipitated\r\nthe unhappy quarrel, then against the way in which the war was waged,\r\nand finally against the futile struggle to retain a hold upon the\r\nAmerican dominions. Among the members of Parliament who thundered\r\nagainst the government were the first statesmen and orators of the land.\r\nWilliam Pitt, Earl of Chatham, though he deplored the idea of American\r\nindependence, denounced the government as the aggressor and rejoiced in\r\nAmerican resistance. Edmund Burke leveled his heavy batteries against\r\nevery measure of coercion and at last strove for a peace which, while\r\ngiving independence to America, would work for reconciliation rather\r\nthan estrangement. Charles James Fox gave the colonies his generous\r\nsympathy and warmly championed their rights. Outside of the circle of\r\nstatesmen there were stout friends of the American cause like David\r\nHume, the philosopher and historian, and Catherine Macaulay, an author\r\nof wide fame and a republican bold enough to encourage Washington in\r\nseeing it through.\r\n\r\nAgainst this powerful opposition, the government enlisted a whole army\r\nof scribes and journalists to pour out criticism on the Americans and\r\ntheir friends. Dr. Samuel Johnson, whom it employed in this business,\r\nwas so savage that even the ministers had to tone down his pamphlets\r\nbefore printing them. Far more weighty was Edward Gibbon, who was in\r\ntime to win fame as the historian of the _Decline and Fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire_. He had at first opposed the government; but, on being given a\r\nlucrative post, he used his sharp pen in its support, causing his\r\nfriends to ridicule him in these lines:\r\n\r\n    \"King George, in a fright\r\n     Lest Gibbon should write\r\n       The story of England's disgrace,\r\n     Thought no way so sure\r\n     His pen to secure\r\n       As to give the historian a place.\"\r\n\r\n=Lord North Yields.=--As time wore on, events bore heavily on the side\r\nof the opponents of the government's measures. They had predicted that\r\nconquest was impossible, and they had urged the advantages of a peace\r\nwhich would in some measure restore the affections of the Americans.\r\nEvery day's news confirmed their predictions and lent support to their\r\narguments. Moreover, the war, which sprang out of an effort to relieve\r\nEnglish burdens, made those burdens heavier than ever. Military expenses\r\nwere daily increasing. Trade with the colonies, the greatest single\r\noutlet for British goods and capital, was paralyzed. The heavy debts due\r\nBritish merchants in America were not only unpaid but postponed into an\r\nindefinite future. Ireland was on the verge of revolution. The French\r\nhad a dangerous fleet on the high seas. In vain did the king assert in\r\nDecember, 1781, that no difficulties would ever make him consent to a\r\npeace that meant American independence. Parliament knew better, and on\r\nFebruary 27, 1782, in the House of Commons was carried an address to the\r\nthrone against continuing the war. Burke, Fox, the younger Pitt, Barré,\r\nand other friends of the colonies voted in the affirmative. Lord North\r\ngave notice then that his ministry was at an end. The king moaned:\r\n\"Necessity made me yield.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1782, Franklin received word from the English government that\r\nit was prepared to enter into negotiations leading to a settlement. This\r\nwas embarrassing. In the treaty of alliance with France, the United\r\nStates had promised that peace should be a joint affair agreed to by\r\nboth nations in open conference. Finding France, however, opposed to\r\nsome of their claims respecting boundaries and fisheries, the American\r\ncommissioners conferred with the British agents at Paris without\r\nconsulting the French minister. They actually signed a preliminary peace\r\ndraft before they informed him of their operations. When Vergennes\r\nreproached him, Franklin replied that they \"had been guilty of\r\nneglecting _bienséance_ [good manners] but hoped that the great work\r\nwould not be ruined by a single indiscretion.\"\r\n\r\n=The Terms of Peace (1783).=--The general settlement at Paris in 1783\r\nwas a triumph for America. England recognized the independence of the\r\nUnited States, naming each state specifically, and agreed to boundaries\r\nextending from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and from the Great Lakes\r\nto the Floridas. England held Canada, Newfoundland, and the West Indies\r\nintact, made gains in India, and maintained her supremacy on the seas.\r\nSpain won Florida and Minorca but not the coveted Gibraltar. France\r\ngained nothing important save the satisfaction of seeing England humbled\r\nand the colonies independent.\r\n\r\nThe generous terms secured by the American commission at Paris called\r\nforth surprise and gratitude in the United States and smoothed the way\r\nfor a renewal of commercial relations with the mother country. At the\r\nsame time they gave genuine anxiety to European diplomats. \"This federal\r\nrepublic is born a pigmy,\" wrote the Spanish ambassador to his royal\r\nmaster. \"A day will come when it will be a giant; even a colossus\r\nformidable to these countries. Liberty of conscience and the facility\r\nfor establishing a new population on immense lands, as well as the\r\nadvantages of the new government, will draw thither farmers and artisans\r\nfrom all the nations. In a few years we shall watch with grief the\r\ntyrannical existence of the same colossus.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORTH AMERICA ACCORDING TO THE TREATY OF 1783]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD\r\n\r\nThe independence of the American colonies was foreseen by many European\r\nstatesmen as they watched the growth of their population, wealth, and\r\npower; but no one could fix the hour of the great event. Until 1763 the\r\nAmerican colonists lived fairly happily under British dominion. There\r\nwere collisions from time to time, of course. Royal governors clashed\r\nwith stiff-necked colonial legislatures. There were protests against the\r\nexercise of the king's veto power in specific cases. Nevertheless, on\r\nthe whole, the relations between America and the mother country were\r\nmore amicable in 1763 than at any period under the Stuart régime which\r\nclosed in 1688.\r\n\r\nThe crash, when it came, was not deliberately willed by any one. It was\r\nthe product of a number of forces that happened to converge about 1763.\r\nThree years before, there had come to the throne George III, a young,\r\nproud, inexperienced, and stubborn king. For nearly fifty years his\r\npredecessors, Germans as they were in language and interest, had allowed\r\nthings to drift in England and America. George III decided that he would\r\nbe king in fact as well as in name. About the same time England brought\r\nto a close the long and costly French and Indian War and was staggering\r\nunder a heavy burden of debt and taxes. The war had been fought partly\r\nin defense of the American colonies and nothing seemed more reasonable\r\nto English statesmen than the idea that the colonies should bear part of\r\nthe cost of their own defense. At this juncture there came into\r\nprominence, in royal councils, two men bent on taxing America and\r\ncontrolling her trade, Grenville and Townshend. The king was willing,\r\nthe English taxpayers were thankful for any promise of relief, and\r\nstatesmen were found to undertake the experiment. England therefore set\r\nout upon a new course. She imposed taxes upon the colonists, regulated\r\ntheir trade and set royal officers upon them to enforce the law. This\r\naction evoked protests from the colonists. They held a Stamp Act\r\nCongress to declare their rights and petition for a redress of\r\ngrievances. Some of the more restless spirits rioted in the streets,\r\nsacked the houses of the king's officers, and tore up the stamped paper.\r\n\r\nFrightened by uprising, the English government drew back and repealed\r\nthe Stamp Act. Then it veered again and renewed its policy of\r\ninterference. Interference again called forth American protests.\r\nProtests aroused sharper retaliation. More British regulars were sent\r\nover to keep order. More irritating laws were passed by Parliament.\r\nRioting again appeared: tea was dumped in the harbor of Boston and\r\nseized in the harbor of Charleston. The British answer was more force.\r\nThe response of the colonists was a Continental Congress for defense. An\r\nunexpected and unintended clash of arms at Lexington and Concord in the\r\nspring of 1775 brought forth from the king of England a proclamation:\r\n\"The Americans are rebels!\"\r\n\r\nThe die was cast. The American Revolution had begun. Washington was made\r\ncommander-in-chief. Armies were raised, money was borrowed, a huge\r\nvolume of paper currency was issued, and foreign aid was summoned.\r\nFranklin plied his diplomatic arts at Paris until in 1778 he induced\r\nFrance to throw her sword into the balance. Three years later,\r\nCornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. In 1783, by the formal treaty of\r\npeace, George III acknowledged the independence of the United States.\r\nThe new nation, endowed with an imperial domain stretching from the\r\nAtlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River, began its career among the\r\nsovereign powers of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of civil government, the results of the Revolution were\r\nequally remarkable. Royal officers and royal authorities were driven\r\nfrom the former dominions. All power was declared to be in the people.\r\nAll the colonies became states, each with its own constitution or plan\r\nof government. The thirteen states were united in common bonds under the\r\nArticles of Confederation. A republic on a large scale was instituted.\r\nThus there was begun an adventure in popular government such as the\r\nworld had never seen. Could it succeed or was it destined to break down\r\nand be supplanted by a monarchy? The fate of whole continents hung upon\r\nthe answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nJ.

THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE FORMATION OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROMISE AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nThe rise of a young republic composed of thirteen states, each governed\r\nby officials popularly elected under constitutions drafted by \"the plain\r\npeople,\" was the most significant feature of the eighteenth century. The\r\nmajority of the patriots whose labors and sacrifices had made this\r\npossible naturally looked upon their work and pronounced it good. Those\r\nAmericans, however, who peered beneath the surface of things, saw that\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, even if splendidly phrased, and paper\r\nconstitutions, drawn by finest enthusiasm \"uninstructed by experience,\"\r\ncould not alone make the republic great and prosperous or even free. All\r\naround them they saw chaos in finance and in industry and perils for the\r\nimmediate future.\r\n\r\n=The Weakness of the Articles of Confederation.=--The government under\r\nthe Articles of Confederation had neither the strength nor the resources\r\nnecessary to cope with the problems of reconstruction left by the war.\r\nThe sole organ of government was a Congress composed of from two to\r\nseven members from each state chosen as the legislature might direct and\r\npaid by the state. In determining all questions, each state had one\r\nvote--Delaware thus enjoying the same weight as Virginia. There was no\r\npresident to enforce the laws. Congress was given power to select a\r\ncommittee of thirteen--one from each state--to act as an executive body\r\nwhen it was not in session; but this device, on being tried out, proved\r\na failure. There was no system of national courts to which citizens and\r\nstates could appeal for the protection of their rights or through which\r\nthey could compel obedience to law. The two great powers of government,\r\nmilitary and financial, were withheld. Congress, it is true, could\r\nauthorize expenditures but had to rely upon the states for the payment\r\nof contributions to meet its bills. It could also order the\r\nestablishment of an army, but it could only request the states to supply\r\ntheir respective quotas of soldiers. It could not lay taxes nor bring\r\nany pressure to bear upon a single citizen in the whole country. It\r\ncould act only through the medium of the state governments.\r\n\r\n=Financial and Commercial Disorders.=--In the field of public finance,\r\nthe disorders were pronounced. The huge debt incurred during the war was\r\nstill outstanding. Congress was unable to pay either the interest or the\r\nprincipal. Public creditors were in despair, as the market value of\r\ntheir bonds sank to twenty-five or even ten cents on the dollar. The\r\ncurrent bills of Congress were unpaid. As some one complained, there was\r\nnot enough money in the treasury to buy pen and ink with which to record\r\nthe transactions of the shadow legislature. The currency was in utter\r\nchaos. Millions of dollars in notes issued by Congress had become mere\r\ntrash worth a cent or two on the dollar. There was no other expression\r\nof contempt so forceful as the popular saying: \"not worth a\r\nContinental.\" To make matters worse, several of the states were pouring\r\nnew streams of paper money from the press. Almost the only good money in\r\ncirculation consisted of English, French, and Spanish coins, and the\r\npublic was even defrauded by them because money changers were busy\r\nclipping and filing away the metal. Foreign commerce was unsettled. The\r\nentire British system of trade discrimination was turned against the\r\nAmericans, and Congress, having no power to regulate foreign commerce,\r\nwas unable to retaliate or to negotiate treaties which it could enforce.\r\nDomestic commerce was impeded by the jealousies of the states, which\r\nerected tariff barriers against their neighbors. The condition of the\r\ncurrency made the exchange of money and goods extremely difficult, and,\r\nas if to increase the confusion, backward states enacted laws hindering\r\nthe prompt collection of debts within their borders--an evil which\r\nnothing but a national system of courts could cure.\r\n\r\n=Congress in Disrepute.=--With treaties set at naught by the states, the\r\nlaws unenforced, the treasury empty, and the public credit gone, the\r\nCongress of the United States fell into utter disrepute. It called upon\r\nthe states to pay their quotas of money into the treasury, only to be\r\ntreated with contempt. Even its own members looked upon it as a solemn\r\nfutility. Some of the ablest men refused to accept election to it, and\r\nmany who did take the doubtful honor failed to attend the sessions.\r\nAgain and again it was impossible to secure a quorum for the transaction\r\nof business.\r\n\r\n=Troubles of the State Governments.=--The state governments, free to\r\npursue their own course with no interference from without, had almost as\r\nmany difficulties as the Congress. They too were loaded with\r\nrevolutionary debts calling for heavy taxes upon an already restive\r\npopulation. Oppressed by their financial burdens and discouraged by the\r\nfall in prices which followed the return of peace, the farmers of\r\nseveral states joined in a concerted effort and compelled their\r\nlegislatures to issue large sums of paper money. The currency fell in\r\nvalue, but nevertheless it was forced on unwilling creditors to square\r\nold accounts.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the country legislative action fluctuated violently.\r\nLaws were made one year only to be repealed the next and reënacted the\r\nthird year. Lands were sold by one legislature and the sales were\r\ncanceled by its successor. Uncertainty and distrust were the natural\r\nconsequences. Men of substance longed for some power that would forbid\r\nstates to issue bills of credit, to make paper money legal tender in\r\npayment of debts, or to impair the obligation of contracts. Men heavily\r\nin debt, on the other hand, urged even more drastic action against\r\ncreditors.\r\n\r\nSo great did the discontent of the farmers in New Hampshire become in\r\n1786 that a mob surrounded the legislature, demanding a repeal of the\r\ntaxes and the issuance of paper money. It was with difficulty that an\r\narmed rebellion was avoided. In Massachusetts the malcontents, under the\r\nleadership of Daniel Shays, a captain in the Revolutionary army,\r\norganized that same year open resistance to the government of the state.\r\nShays and his followers protested against the conduct of creditors in\r\nforeclosing mortgages upon the debt-burdened farmers, against the\r\nlawyers for increasing the costs of legal proceedings, against the\r\nsenate of the state the members of which were apportioned among the\r\ntowns on the basis of the amount of taxes paid, against heavy taxes, and\r\nagainst the refusal of the legislature to issue paper money. They seized\r\nthe towns of Worcester and Springfield and broke up the courts of\r\njustice. All through the western part of the state the revolt spread,\r\nsending a shock of alarm to every center and section of the young\r\nrepublic. Only by the most vigorous action was Governor Bowdoin able to\r\nquell the uprising; and when that task was accomplished, the state\r\ngovernment did not dare to execute any of the prisoners because they had\r\nso many sympathizers. Moreover, Bowdoin and several members of the\r\nlegislature who had been most zealous in their attacks on the insurgents\r\nwere defeated at the ensuing election. The need of national assistance\r\nfor state governments in times of domestic violence was everywhere\r\nemphasized by men who were opposed to revolutionary acts.\r\n\r\n=Alarm over Dangers to the Republic.=--Leading American citizens,\r\nwatching the drift of affairs, were slowly driven to the conclusion that\r\nthe new ship of state so proudly launched a few years before was\r\ncareening into anarchy. \"The facts of our peace and independence,\" wrote\r\na friend of Washington, \"do not at present wear so promising an\r\nappearance as I had fondly painted in my mind. The prejudices,\r\njealousies, and turbulence of the people at times almost stagger my\r\nconfidence in our political establishments; and almost occasion me to\r\nthink that they will show themselves unworthy of the noble prize for\r\nwhich we have contended.\"\r\n\r\nWashington himself was profoundly discouraged. On hearing of Shays's\r\nrebellion, he exclaimed: \"What, gracious God, is man that there should\r\nbe such inconsistency and perfidiousness in his conduct! It is but the\r\nother day that we were shedding our blood to obtain the constitutions\r\nunder which we now live--constitutions of our own choice and making--and\r\nnow we are unsheathing our sword to overturn them.\" The same year he\r\nburst out in a lament over rumors of restoring royal government. \"I am\r\ntold that even respectable characters speak of a monarchical government\r\nwithout horror. From thinking proceeds speaking. Hence to acting is\r\noften but a single step. But how irresistible and tremendous! What a\r\ntriumph for our enemies to verify their predictions! What a triumph for\r\nthe advocates of despotism to find that we are incapable of governing\r\nourselves!\"\r\n\r\n=Congress Attempts Some Reforms.=--The Congress was not indifferent to\r\nthe events that disturbed Washington. On the contrary it put forth many\r\nefforts to check tendencies so dangerous to finance, commerce,\r\nindustries, and the Confederation itself. In 1781, even before the\r\ntreaty of peace was signed, the Congress, having found out how futile\r\nwere its taxing powers, carried a resolution of amendment to the\r\nArticles of Confederation, authorizing the levy of a moderate duty on\r\nimports. Yet this mild measure was rejected by the states. Two years\r\nlater the Congress prepared another amendment sanctioning the levy of\r\nduties on imports, to be collected this time by state officers and\r\napplied to the payment of the public debt. This more limited proposal,\r\ndesigned to save public credit, likewise failed. In 1786, the Congress\r\nmade a third appeal to the states for help, declaring that they had been\r\nso irregular and so negligent in paying their quotas that further\r\nreliance upon that mode of raising revenues was dishonorable and\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CALLING OF A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\r\n\r\n=Hamilton and Washington Urge Reform.=--The attempts at reform by the\r\nCongress were accompanied by demand for, both within and without that\r\nbody, a convention to frame a new plan of government. In 1780, the\r\nyouthful Alexander Hamilton, realizing the weakness of the Articles, so\r\nwidely discussed, proposed a general convention for the purpose of\r\ndrafting a new constitution on entirely different principles. With\r\ntireless energy he strove to bring his countrymen to his view.\r\nWashington, agreeing with him on every point, declared, in a circular\r\nletter to the governors, that the duration of the union would be short\r\nunless there was lodged somewhere a supreme power \"to regulate and\r\ngovern the general concerns of the confederated republic.\" The governor\r\nof Massachusetts, disturbed by the growth of discontent all about him,\r\nsuggested to the state legislature in 1785 the advisability of a\r\nnational convention to enlarge the powers of the Congress. The\r\nlegislature approved the plan, but did not press it to a conclusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER HAMILTON]\r\n\r\n=The Annapolis Convention.=--Action finally came from the South. The\r\nVirginia legislature, taking things into its own hands, called a\r\nconference of delegates at Annapolis to consider matters of taxation and\r\ncommerce. When the convention assembled in 1786, it was found that only\r\nfive states had taken the trouble to send representatives. The leaders\r\nwere deeply discouraged, but the resourceful Hamilton, a delegate from\r\nNew York, turned the affair to good account. He secured the adoption of\r\na resolution, calling upon the Congress itself to summon another\r\nconvention, to meet at Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n=A National Convention Called (1787).=--The Congress, as tardy as ever,\r\nat last decided in February, 1787, to issue the call. Fearing drastic\r\nchanges, however, it restricted the convention to \"the sole and express\r\npurpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" Jealous of its own\r\npowers, it added that any alterations proposed should be referred to the\r\nCongress and the states for their approval.\r\n\r\nEvery state in the union, except Rhode Island, responded to this call.\r\nIndeed some of the states, having the Annapolis resolution before them,\r\nhad already anticipated the Congress by selecting delegates before the\r\nformal summons came. Thus, by the persistence of governors,\r\nlegislatures, and private citizens, there was brought about the\r\nlong-desired national convention. In May, 1787, it assembled in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n=The Eminent Men of the Convention.=--On the roll of that memorable\r\nconvention were fifty-five men, at least half of whom were acknowledged\r\nto be among the foremost statesmen and thinkers in America. Every field\r\nof statecraft was represented by them: war and practical management in\r\nWashington, who was chosen president of the convention; diplomacy in\r\nFranklin, now old and full of honor in his own land as well as abroad;\r\nfinance in Alexander Hamilton and Robert Morris; law in James Wilson of\r\nPennsylvania; the philosophy of government in James Madison, called the\r\n\"father of the Constitution.\" They were not theorists but practical men,\r\nrich in political experience and endowed with deep insight into the\r\nsprings of human action. Three of them had served in the Stamp Act\r\nCongress: Dickinson of Delaware, William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut,\r\nand John Rutledge of South Carolina. Eight had been signers of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence: Read of Delaware, Sherman of Connecticut,\r\nWythe of Virginia, Gerry of Massachusetts, Franklin, Robert Morris,\r\nGeorge Clymer, and James Wilson of Pennsylvania. All but twelve had at\r\nsome time served in the Continental Congress and eighteen were members\r\nof that body in the spring of 1787. Washington, Hamilton, Mifflin, and\r\nCharles Pinckney had been officers in the Revolutionary army. Seven of\r\nthe delegates had gained political experience as governors of states.\r\n\"The convention as a whole,\" according to the historian Hildreth,\r\n\"represented in a marked manner the talent, intelligence, and\r\nespecially the conservative sentiment of the country.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRAMING OF THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n=Problems Involved.=--The great problems before the convention were nine\r\nin number: (1) Shall the Articles of Confederation be revised or a new\r\nsystem of government constructed? (2) Shall the government be founded on\r\nstates equal in power as under the Articles or on the broader and deeper\r\nfoundation of population? (3) What direct share shall the people have in\r\nthe election of national officers? (4) What shall be the qualifications\r\nfor the suffrage? (5) How shall the conflicting interests of the\r\ncommercial and the planting states be balanced so as to safeguard the\r\nessential rights of each? (6) What shall be the form of the new\r\ngovernment? (7) What powers shall be conferred on it? (8) How shall the\r\nstate legislatures be restrained from their attacks on property rights\r\nsuch as the issuance of paper money? (9) Shall the approval of all the\r\nstates be necessary, as under the Articles, for the adoption and\r\namendment of the Constitution?\r\n\r\n=Revision of the Articles or a New Government?=--The moment the first\r\nproblem was raised, representatives of the small states, led by William\r\nPaterson of New Jersey, were on their feet. They feared that, if the\r\nArticles were overthrown, the equality and rights of the states would be\r\nput in jeopardy. Their protest was therefore vigorous. They cited the\r\ncall issued by the Congress in summoning the convention which\r\nspecifically stated that they were assembled for \"the sole and express\r\npurpose of revising the Articles of Confederation.\" They cited also\r\ntheir instructions from their state legislatures, which authorized them\r\nto \"revise and amend\" the existing scheme of government, not to make a\r\nrevolution in it. To depart from the authorization laid down by the\r\nCongress and the legislatures would be to exceed their powers, they\r\nargued, and to betray the trust reposed in them by their countrymen.\r\n\r\nTo their contentions, Randolph of Virginia replied: \"When the salvation\r\nof the republic is at stake, it would be treason to our trust not to\r\npropose what we find necessary.\" Hamilton, reminding the delegates that\r\ntheir work was still subject to the approval of the states, frankly said\r\nthat on the point of their powers he had no scruples. With the issue\r\nclear, the convention cast aside the Articles as if they did not exist\r\nand proceeded to the work of drawing up a new constitution, \"laying its\r\nfoundations on such principles and organizing its powers in such form\"\r\nas to the delegates seemed \"most likely to affect their safety and\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\n=A Government Founded on States or on People?--The\r\nCompromise.=--Defeated in their attempt to limit the convention to a\r\nmere revision of the Articles, the spokesmen of the smaller states\r\nredoubled their efforts to preserve the equality of the states. The\r\nsignal for a radical departure from the Articles on this point was given\r\nearly in the sessions when Randolph presented \"the Virginia plan.\" He\r\nproposed that the new national legislature consist of two houses, the\r\nmembers of which were to be apportioned among the states according to\r\ntheir wealth or free white population, as the convention might decide.\r\nThis plan was vehemently challenged. Paterson of New Jersey flatly\r\navowed that neither he nor his state would ever bow to such tyranny. As\r\nan alternative, he presented \"the New Jersey plan\" calling for a\r\nnational legislature of one house representing states as such, not\r\nwealth or people--a legislature in which all states, large or small,\r\nwould have equal voice. Wilson of Pennsylvania, on behalf of the more\r\npopulous states, took up the gauntlet which Paterson had thrown down. It\r\nwas absurd, he urged, for 180,000 men in one state to have the same\r\nweight in national counsels as 750,000 men in another state. \"The\r\ngentleman from New Jersey,\" he said, \"is candid. He declares his opinion\r\nboldly.... I will be equally candid.... I will never confederate on his\r\nprinciples.\" So the bitter controversy ran on through many exciting\r\nsessions.\r\n\r\nGreek had met Greek. The convention was hopelessly deadlocked and on the\r\nverge of dissolution, \"scarce held together by the strength of a hair,\"\r\nas one of the delegates remarked. A crash was averted only by a\r\ncompromise. Instead of a Congress of one house as provided by the\r\nArticles, the convention agreed upon a legislature of two houses. In the\r\nSenate, the aspirations of the small states were to be satisfied, for\r\neach state was given two members in that body. In the formation of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, the larger states were placated, for it was\r\nagreed that the members of that chamber were to be apportioned among the\r\nstates on the basis of population, counting three-fifths of the slaves.\r\n\r\n=The Question of Popular Election.=--The method of selecting federal\r\nofficers and members of Congress also produced an acrimonious debate\r\nwhich revealed how deep-seated was the distrust of the capacity of the\r\npeople to govern themselves. Few there were who believed that no branch\r\nof the government should be elected directly by the voters; still fewer\r\nwere there, however, who desired to see all branches so chosen. One or\r\ntwo even expressed a desire for a monarchy. The dangers of democracy\r\nwere stressed by Gerry of Massachusetts: \"All the evils we experience\r\nflow from an excess of democracy. The people do not want virtue but are\r\nthe dupes of pretended patriots.... I have been too republican\r\nheretofore but have been taught by experience the danger of a leveling\r\nspirit.\" To the \"democratic licentiousness of the state legislatures,\"\r\nRandolph sought to oppose a \"firm senate.\" To check the excesses of\r\npopular government Charles Pinckney of South Carolina declared that no\r\none should be elected President who was not worth $100,000 and that high\r\nproperty qualifications should be placed on members of Congress and\r\njudges. Other members of the convention were stoutly opposed to such\r\n\"high-toned notions of government.\" Franklin and Wilson, both from\r\nPennsylvania, vigorously championed popular election; while men like\r\nMadison insisted that at least one part of the government should rest on\r\nthe broad foundation of the people.\r\n\r\nOut of this clash of opinion also came compromise. One branch, the House\r\nof Representatives, it was agreed, was to be elected directly by the\r\nvoters, while the Senators were to be elected indirectly by the state\r\nlegislatures. The President was to be chosen by electors selected as the\r\nlegislatures of the states might determine, and the judges of the\r\nfederal courts, supreme and inferior, by the President and the Senate.\r\n\r\n=The Question of the Suffrage.=--The battle over the suffrage was sharp\r\nbut brief. Gouverneur Morris proposed that only land owners should be\r\npermitted to vote. Madison replied that the state legislatures, which\r\nhad made so much trouble with radical laws, were elected by freeholders.\r\nAfter the debate, the delegates, unable to agree on any property\r\nlimitations on the suffrage, decided that the House of Representatives\r\nshould be elected by voters having the \"qualifications requisite for\r\nelectors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature.\" Thus\r\nthey accepted the suffrage provisions of the states.\r\n\r\n=The Balance between the Planting and the Commercial States.=--After the\r\ndebates had gone on for a few weeks, Madison came to the conclusion that\r\nthe real division in the convention was not between the large and the\r\nsmall states but between the planting section founded on slave labor and\r\nthe commercial North. Thus he anticipated by nearly three-quarters of a\r\ncentury \"the irrepressible conflict.\" The planting states had neither\r\nthe free white population nor the wealth of the North. There were,\r\ncounting Delaware, six of them as against seven commercial states.\r\nDependent for their prosperity mainly upon the sale of tobacco, rice,\r\nand other staples abroad, they feared that Congress might impose\r\nrestraints upon their enterprise. Being weaker in numbers, they were\r\nafraid that the majority might lay an unfair burden of taxes upon them.\r\n\r\n_Representation and Taxation._--The Southern members of the convention\r\nwere therefore very anxious to secure for their section the largest\r\npossible representation in Congress, and at the same time to restrain\r\nthe taxing power of that body. Two devices were thought adapted to these\r\nends. One was to count the slaves as people when apportioning\r\nrepresentatives among the states according to their respective\r\npopulations; the other was to provide that direct taxes should be\r\napportioned among the states, in proportion not to their wealth but to\r\nthe number of their free white inhabitants. For obvious reasons the\r\nNorthern delegates objected to these proposals. Once more a compromise\r\nproved to be the solution. It was agreed that not all the slaves but\r\nthree-fifths of them should be counted for both purposes--representation\r\nand direct taxation.\r\n\r\n_Commerce and the Slave Trade._--Southern interests were also involved\r\nin the project to confer upon Congress the power to regulate interstate\r\nand foreign commerce. To the manufacturing and trading states this was\r\nessential. It would prevent interstate tariffs and trade jealousies; it\r\nwould enable Congress to protect American manufactures and to break\r\ndown, by appropriate retaliations, foreign discriminations against\r\nAmerican commerce. To the South the proposal was menacing because\r\ntariffs might interfere with the free exchange of the produce of\r\nplantations in European markets, and navigation acts might confine the\r\ncarrying trade to American, that is Northern, ships. The importation of\r\nslaves, moreover, it was feared might be heavily taxed or immediately\r\nprohibited altogether.\r\n\r\nThe result of this and related controversies was a debate on the merits\r\nof slavery. Gouverneur Morris delivered his mind and heart on that\r\nsubject, denouncing slavery as a nefarious institution and the curse of\r\nheaven on the states in which it prevailed. Mason of Virginia, a\r\nslaveholder himself, was hardly less outspoken, saying: \"Slavery\r\ndiscourages arts and manufactures. The poor despise labor when performed\r\nby slaves. They prevent the migration of whites who really strengthen\r\nand enrich a country.\"\r\n\r\nThe system, however, had its defenders. Representatives from South\r\nCarolina argued that their entire economic life rested on slave labor\r\nand that the high death rate in the rice swamps made continuous\r\nimportation necessary. Ellsworth of Connecticut took the ground that\r\nthe convention should not meddle with slavery. \"The morality or wisdom\r\nof slavery,\" he said, \"are considerations belonging to the states. What\r\nenriches a part enriches the whole.\" To the future he turned an\r\nuntroubled face: \"As population increases, poor laborers will be so\r\nplenty as to render slaves useless. Slavery in time will not be a speck\r\nin our country.\" Virginia and North Carolina, already overstocked with\r\nslaves, favored prohibiting the traffic in them; but South Carolina was\r\nadamant. She must have fresh supplies of slaves or she would not\r\nfederate.\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed that, while Congress might regulate foreign trade by\r\nmajority vote, the importation of slaves should not be forbidden before\r\nthe lapse of twenty years, and that any import tax should not exceed $10\r\na head. At the same time, in connection with the regulation of foreign\r\ntrade, it was stipulated that a two-thirds vote in the Senate should be\r\nnecessary in the ratification of treaties. A further concession to the\r\nSouth was made in the provision for the return of runaway slaves--a\r\nprovision also useful in the North, where indentured servants were about\r\nas troublesome as slaves in escaping from their masters.\r\n\r\n=The Form of the Government.=--As to the details of the frame of\r\ngovernment and the grand principles involved, the opinion of the\r\nconvention ebbed and flowed, decisions being taken in the heat of\r\ndebate, only to be revoked and taken again.\r\n\r\n_The Executive._--There was general agreement that there should be an\r\nexecutive branch; for reliance upon Congress to enforce its own laws and\r\ntreaties had been a broken reed. On the character and functions of the\r\nexecutive, however, there were many views. The New Jersey plan called\r\nfor a council selected by the Congress; the Virginia plan provided that\r\nthe executive branch should be chosen by the Congress but did not state\r\nwhether it should be composed of one or several persons. On this matter\r\nthe convention voted first one way and then another; finally it agreed\r\non a single executive chosen indirectly by electors selected as the\r\nstate legislatures might decide, serving for four years, subject to\r\nimpeachment, and endowed with regal powers in the command of the army\r\nand the navy and in the enforcement of the laws.\r\n\r\n_The Legislative Branch--Congress._--After the convention had made the\r\ngreat compromise between the large and small commonwealths by giving\r\nrepresentation to states in the Senate and to population in the House,\r\nthe question of methods of election had to be decided. As to the House\r\nof Representatives it was readily agreed that the members should be\r\nelected by direct popular vote. There was also easy agreement on the\r\nproposition that a strong Senate was needed to check the \"turbulence\" of\r\nthe lower house. Four devices were finally selected to accomplish this\r\npurpose. In the first place, the Senators were not to be chosen directly\r\nby the voters but by the legislatures of the states, thus removing their\r\nelection one degree from the populace. In the second place, their term\r\nwas fixed at six years instead of two, as in the case of the House. In\r\nthe third place, provision was made for continuity by having only\r\none-third of the members go out at a time while two-thirds remained in\r\nservice. Finally, it was provided that Senators must be at least thirty\r\nyears old while Representatives need be only twenty-five.\r\n\r\n_The Judiciary._--The need for federal courts to carry out the law was\r\nhardly open to debate. The feebleness of the Articles of Confederation\r\nwas, in a large measure, attributed to the want of a judiciary to hold\r\nstates and individuals in obedience to the laws and treaties of the\r\nunion. Nevertheless on this point the advocates of states' rights were\r\nextremely sensitive. They looked with distrust upon judges appointed at\r\nthe national capital and emancipated from local interests and\r\ntraditions; they remembered with what insistence they had claimed\r\nagainst Britain the right of local trial by jury and with what\r\nconsternation they had viewed the proposal to make colonial judges\r\nindependent of the assemblies in the matter of their salaries.\r\nReluctantly they yielded to the demand for federal courts, consenting at\r\nfirst only to a supreme court to review cases heard in lower state\r\ncourts and finally to such additional inferior courts as Congress might\r\ndeem necessary.\r\n\r\n_The System of Checks and Balances._--It is thus apparent that the\r\nframers of the Constitution, in shaping the form of government, arranged\r\nfor a distribution of power among three branches, executive,\r\nlegislative, and judicial. Strictly speaking we might say four branches,\r\nfor the legislature, or Congress, was composed of two houses, elected in\r\ndifferent ways, and one of them, the Senate, was made a check on the\r\nPresident through its power of ratifying treaties and appointments. \"The\r\naccumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judicial, in the\r\nsame hands,\" wrote Madison, \"whether of one, a few, or many, and whether\r\nhereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the\r\nvery definition of tyranny.\" The devices which the convention adopted to\r\nprevent such a centralization of authority were exceedingly ingenious\r\nand well calculated to accomplish the purposes of the authors.\r\n\r\nThe legislature consisted of two houses, the members of which were to be\r\napportioned on a different basis, elected in different ways, and to\r\nserve for different terms. A veto on all its acts was vested in a\r\nPresident elected in a manner not employed in the choice of either\r\nbranch of the legislature, serving for four years, and subject to\r\nremoval only by the difficult process of impeachment. After a law had\r\nrun the gantlet of both houses and the executive, it was subject to\r\ninterpretation and annulment by the judiciary, appointed by the\r\nPresident with the consent of the Senate and serving for life. Thus it\r\nwas made almost impossible for any political party to get possession of\r\nall branches of the government at a single popular election. As Hamilton\r\nremarked, the friends of good government considered \"every institution\r\ncalculated to restrain the excess of law making and to keep things in\r\nthe same state in which they happen to be at any given period as more\r\nlikely to do good than harm.\"\r\n\r\n=The Powers of the Federal Government.=--On the question of the powers\r\nto be conferred upon the new government there was less occasion for a\r\nserious dispute. Even the delegates from the small states agreed with\r\nthose from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia that new powers\r\nshould be added to those intrusted to Congress by the Articles of\r\nConfederation. The New Jersey plan as well as the Virginia plan\r\nrecognized this fact. Some of the delegates, like Hamilton and Madison,\r\neven proposed to give Congress a general legislative authority covering\r\nall national matters; but others, frightened by the specter of\r\nnationalism, insisted on specifying each power to be conferred and\r\nfinally carried the day.\r\n\r\n_Taxation and Commerce._--There were none bold enough to dissent from\r\nthe proposition that revenue must be provided to pay current expenses\r\nand discharge the public debt. When once the dispute over the\r\napportionment of direct taxes among the slave states was settled, it was\r\nan easy matter to decide that Congress should have power to lay and\r\ncollect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises. In this way the national\r\ngovernment was freed from dependence upon stubborn and tardy\r\nlegislatures and enabled to collect funds directly from citizens. There\r\nwere likewise none bold enough to contend that the anarchy of state\r\ntariffs and trade discriminations should be longer endured. When the\r\nfears of the planting states were allayed and the \"bargain\" over the\r\nimportation of slaves was reached, the convention vested in Congress the\r\npower to regulate foreign and interstate commerce.\r\n\r\n_National Defense._--The necessity for national defense was realized,\r\nthough the fear of huge military establishments was equally present. The\r\nold practice of relying on quotas furnished by the state legislatures\r\nwas completely discredited. As in the case of taxes a direct authority\r\nover citizens was demanded. Congress was therefore given full power to\r\nraise and support armies and a navy. It could employ the state militia\r\nwhen desirable; but it could at the same time maintain a regular army\r\nand call directly upon all able-bodied males if the nature of a crisis\r\nwas thought to require it.\r\n\r\n_The \"Necessary and Proper\" Clause._--To the specified power vested in\r\nCongress by the Constitution, the advocates of a strong national\r\ngovernment added a general clause authorizing it to make all laws\r\n\"necessary and proper\" for carrying into effect any and all of the\r\nenumerated powers. This clause, interpreted by that master mind, Chief\r\nJustice Marshall, was later construed to confer powers as wide as the\r\nrequirements of a vast country spanning a continent and taking its place\r\namong the mighty nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n=Restraints on the States.=--Framing a government and endowing it with\r\nlarge powers were by no means the sole concern of the convention. Its\r\nvery existence had been due quite as much to the conduct of the state\r\nlegislatures as to the futilities of a paralyzed Continental Congress.\r\nIn every state, explains Marshall in his _Life of Washington_, there was\r\na party of men who had \"marked out for themselves a more indulgent\r\ncourse. Viewing with extreme tenderness the case of the debtor, their\r\nefforts were unceasingly directed to his relief. To exact a faithful\r\ncompliance with contracts was, in their opinion, a harsh measure which\r\nthe people could not bear. They were uniformly in favor of relaxing the\r\nadministration of justice, of affording facilities for the payment of\r\ndebts, or of suspending their collection, and remitting taxes.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislatures under the dominance of these men had enacted paper\r\nmoney laws enabling debtors to discharge their obligations more easily.\r\nThe convention put an end to such practices by providing that no state\r\nshould emit bills of credit or make anything but gold or silver legal\r\ntender in the payment of debts. The state legislatures had enacted laws\r\nallowing men to pay their debts by turning over to creditors land or\r\npersonal property; they had repealed the charter of an endowed college\r\nand taken the management from the hands of the lawful trustees; and they\r\nhad otherwise interfered with the enforcement of private agreements. The\r\nconvention, taking notice of such matters, inserted a clause forbidding\r\nstates \"to impair the obligation of contracts.\" The more venturous of\r\nthe radicals had in Massachusetts raised the standard of revolt against\r\nthe authorities of the state. The convention answered by a brief\r\nsentence to the effect that the President of the United States, to be\r\nequipped with a regular army, would send troops to suppress domestic\r\ninsurrections whenever called upon by the legislature or, if it was not\r\nin session, by the governor of the state. To make sure that the\r\nrestrictions on the states would not be dead letters, the federal\r\nConstitution, laws, and treaties were made the supreme law of the land,\r\nto be enforced whenever necessary by a national judiciary and executive\r\nagainst violations on the part of any state authorities.\r\n\r\n=Provisions for Ratification and Amendment.=--When the frame of\r\ngovernment had been determined, the powers to be vested in it had been\r\nenumerated, and the restrictions upon the states had been written into\r\nthe bond, there remained three final questions. How shall the\r\nConstitution be ratified? What number of states shall be necessary to\r\nput it into effect? How shall it be amended in the future?\r\n\r\nOn the first point, the mandate under which the convention was sitting\r\nseemed positive. The Articles of Confederation were still in effect.\r\nThey provided that amendments could be made only by unanimous adoption\r\nin Congress and the approval of all the states. As if to give force to\r\nthis provision of law, the call for the convention had expressly stated\r\nthat all alterations and revisions should be reported to Congress for\r\nadoption or rejection, Congress itself to transmit the document\r\nthereafter to the states for their review.\r\n\r\nTo have observed the strict letter of the law would have defeated the\r\npurposes of the delegates, because Congress and the state legislatures\r\nwere openly hostile to such drastic changes as had been made. Unanimous\r\nratification, as events proved, would have been impossible. Therefore\r\nthe delegates decided that the Constitution should be sent to Congress\r\nwith the recommendation that it, in turn, transmit the document, not to\r\nthe state legislatures, but to conventions held in the states for the\r\nspecial object of deciding upon ratification. This process was followed.\r\nIt was their belief that special conventions would be more friendly than\r\nthe state legislatures.\r\n\r\nThe convention was equally positive in dealing with the problem of the\r\nnumber of states necessary to establish the new Constitution. Attempts\r\nto change the Articles had failed because amendment required the\r\napproval of every state and there was always at least one recalcitrant\r\nmember of the union. The opposition to a new Constitution was\r\nundoubtedly formidable. Rhode Island had even refused to take part in\r\nframing it, and her hostility was deep and open. So the convention cast\r\naside the provision of the Articles of Confederation which required\r\nunanimous approval for any change in the plan of government; it decreed\r\nthat the new Constitution should go into effect when ratified by nine\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nIn providing for future changes in the Constitution itself the\r\nconvention also thrust aside the old rule of unanimous approval, and\r\ndecided that an amendment could be made on a two-thirds vote in both\r\nhouses of Congress and ratification by three-fourths of the states. This\r\nchange was of profound significance. Every state agreed to be bound in\r\nthe future by amendments duly adopted even in case it did not approve\r\nthem itself. America in this way set out upon the high road that led\r\nfrom a league of states to a nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE OVER RATIFICATION\r\n\r\nOn September 17, 1787, the Constitution, having been finally drafted in\r\nclear and simple language, a model to all makers of fundamental law, was\r\nadopted. The convention, after nearly four months of debate in secret\r\nsession, flung open the doors and presented to the Americans the\r\nfinished plan for the new government. Then the great debate passed to\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\n=The Opposition.=--Storms of criticism at once descended upon the\r\nConstitution. \"Fraudulent usurpation!\" exclaimed Gerry, who had refused\r\nto sign it. \"A monster\" out of the \"thick veil of secrecy,\" declaimed a\r\nPennsylvania newspaper. \"An iron-handed despotism will be the result,\"\r\nprotested a third. \"We, 'the low-born,'\" sarcastically wrote a fourth,\r\n\"will now admit the 'six hundred well-born' immediately to establish\r\nthis most noble, most excellent, and truly divine constitution.\" The\r\nPresident will become a king; Congress will be as tyrannical as\r\nParliament in the old days; the states will be swallowed up; the rights\r\nof the people will be trampled upon; the poor man's justice will be lost\r\nin the endless delays of the federal courts--such was the strain of the\r\nprotests against ratification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT OF _The Federalist_]\r\n\r\n=Defense of the Constitution.=--Moved by the tempest of opposition,\r\nHamilton, Madison, and Jay took up their pens in defense of the\r\nConstitution. In a series of newspaper articles they discussed and\r\nexpounded with eloquence, learning, and dignity every important clause\r\nand provision of the proposed plan. These papers, afterwards collected\r\nand published in a volume known as _The Federalist_, form the finest\r\ntextbook on the Constitution that has ever been printed. It takes its\r\nplace, moreover, among the wisest and weightiest treatises on government\r\never written in any language in any time. Other men, not so gifted, were\r\nno less earnest in their support of ratification. In private\r\ncorrespondence, editorials, pamphlets, and letters to the newspapers,\r\nthey urged their countrymen to forget their partisanship and accept a\r\nConstitution which, in spite of any defects great or small, was the\r\nonly guarantee against dissolution and warfare at home and dishonor and\r\nweakness abroad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CELEBRATING THE RATIFICATION]\r\n\r\n=The Action of the State Conventions.=--Before the end of the year,\r\n1787, three states had ratified the Constitution: Delaware and New\r\nJersey unanimously and Pennsylvania after a short, though savage,\r\ncontest. Connecticut and Georgia followed early the next year. Then came\r\nthe battle royal in Massachusetts, ending in ratification in February by\r\nthe narrow margin of 187 votes to 168. In the spring came the news that\r\nMaryland and South Carolina were \"under the new roof.\" On June 21, New\r\nHampshire, where the sentiment was at first strong enough to defeat the\r\nConstitution, joined the new republic, influenced by the favorable\r\ndecision in Massachusetts. Swift couriers were sent to carry the news to\r\nNew York and Virginia, where the question of ratification was still\r\nundecided. Nine states had accepted it and were united, whether more saw\r\nfit to join or not.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, however, Virginia, after a long and searching debate, had\r\ngiven her approval by a narrow margin, leaving New York as the next seat\r\nof anxiety. In that state the popular vote for the delegates to the\r\nconvention had been clearly and heavily against ratification. Events\r\nfinally demonstrated the futility of resistance, and Hamilton by good\r\njudgment and masterly arguments was at last able to marshal a majority\r\nof thirty to twenty-seven votes in favor of ratification.\r\n\r\nThe great contest was over. All the states, except North Carolina and\r\nRhode Island, had ratified. \"The sloop Anarchy,\" wrote an ebullient\r\njournalist, \"when last heard from was ashore on Union rocks.\"\r\n\r\n=The First Election.=--In the autumn of 1788, elections were held to\r\nfill the places in the new government. Public opinion was overwhelmingly\r\nin favor of Washington as the first President. Yielding to the\r\nimportunities of friends, he accepted the post in the spirit of public\r\nservice. On April 30, 1789, he took the oath of office at Federal Hall\r\nin New York City. \"Long live George Washington, President of the United\r\nStates!\" cried Chancellor Livingston as soon as the General had kissed\r\nthe Bible. The cry was caught by the assembled multitude and given back.\r\nA new experiment in popular government was launched.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nM.

Several members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, headed by James Madison, had also been at Philadelphia\r\nin 1787. In making his appointments, Washington strengthened the new\r\nsystem of government still further by a judicious selection of\r\nofficials. He chose as Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,\r\nwho had been the most zealous for its success; General Knox, head of the\r\nWar Department, and Edmund Randolph, the Attorney-General, were likewise\r\nconspicuous friends of the experiment. Every member of the federal\r\njudiciary whom Washington appointed, from the Chief Justice, John Jay,\r\ndown to the justices of the district courts, had favored the\r\nratification of the Constitution; and a majority of them had served as\r\nmembers of the national convention that framed the document or of the\r\nstate ratifying conventions. Only one man of influence in the new\r\ngovernment, Thomas Jefferson, the Secretary of State, was reckoned as a\r\ndoubter in the house of the faithful. He had expressed opinions both for\r\nand against the Constitution; but he had been out of the country acting\r\nas the minister at Paris when the Constitution was drafted and ratified.\r\n\r\n=An Opposition to Conciliate.=--The inauguration of Washington amid the\r\nplaudits of his countrymen did not set at rest all the political turmoil\r\nwhich had been aroused by the angry contest over ratification. \"The\r\ninteresting nature of the question,\" wrote John Marshall, \"the equality\r\nof the parties, the animation produced inevitably by ardent debate had a\r\nnecessary tendency to embitter the dispositions of the vanquished and to\r\nfix more deeply in many bosoms their prejudices against a plan of\r\ngovernment in opposition to which all their passions were enlisted.\" The\r\nleaders gathered around Washington were well aware of the excited state\r\nof the country. They saw Rhode Island and North Carolina still outside\r\nof the union.[1] They knew by what small margins the Constitution had\r\nbeen approved in the great states of Massachusetts, Virginia, and New\r\nYork. They were equally aware that a majority of the state conventions,\r\nin yielding reluctant approval to the Constitution, had drawn a number\r\nof amendments for immediate submission to the states.\r\n\r\n=The First Amendments--a Bill of Rights.=--To meet the opposition,\r\nMadison proposed, and the first Congress adopted, a series of amendments\r\nto the Constitution. Ten of them were soon ratified and became in 1791 a\r\npart of the law of the land. These amendments provided, among other\r\nthings, that Congress could make no law respecting the establishment of\r\nreligion, abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right\r\nof the people peaceably to assemble and petition the government for a\r\nredress of grievances. They also guaranteed indictment by grand jury and\r\ntrial by jury for all persons charged by federal officers with serious\r\ncrimes. To reassure those who still feared that local rights might be\r\ninvaded by the federal government, the tenth amendment expressly\r\nprovided that the powers not delegated to the United States by the\r\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the\r\nstates respectively or to the people. Seven years later, the eleventh\r\namendment was written in the same spirit as the first ten, after a\r\nheated debate over the action of the Supreme Court in permitting a\r\ncitizen to bring a suit against \"the sovereign state\" of Georgia. The\r\nnew amendment was designed to protect states against the federal\r\njudiciary by forbidding it to hear any case in which a state was sued by\r\na citizen.\r\n\r\n=Funding the National Debt.=--Paper declarations of rights, however,\r\npaid no bills. To this task Hamilton turned all his splendid genius. At\r\nthe very outset he addressed himself to the problem of the huge public\r\ndebt, daily mounting as the unpaid interest accumulated. In a _Report on\r\nPublic Credit_ under date of January 9, 1790, one of the first and\r\ngreatest of American state papers, he laid before Congress the outlines\r\nof his plan. He proposed that the federal government should call in all\r\nthe old bonds, certificates of indebtedness, and other promises to pay\r\nwhich had been issued by the Congress since the beginning of the\r\nRevolution. These national obligations, he urged, should be put into one\r\nconsolidated debt resting on the credit of the United States; to the\r\nholders of the old paper should be issued new bonds drawing interest at\r\nfixed rates. This process was called \"funding the debt.\" Such a\r\nprovision for the support of public credit, Hamilton insisted, would\r\nsatisfy creditors, restore landed property to its former value, and\r\nfurnish new resources to agriculture and commerce in the form of credit\r\nand capital.\r\n\r\n=Assumption and Funding of State Debts.=--Hamilton then turned to the\r\nobligations incurred by the several states in support of the Revolution.\r\nThese debts he proposed to add to the national debt. They were to be\r\n\"assumed\" by the United States government and placed on the same secure\r\nfoundation as the continental debt. This measure he defended not merely\r\non grounds of national honor. It would, as he foresaw, give strength to\r\nthe new national government by making all public creditors, men of\r\nsubstance in their several communities, look to the federal, rather than\r\nthe state government, for the satisfaction of their claims.\r\n\r\n=Funding at Face Value.=--On the question of the terms of consolidation,\r\nassumption, and funding, Hamilton had a firm conviction. That millions\r\nof dollars' worth of the continental and state bonds had passed out of\r\nthe hands of those who had originally subscribed their funds to the\r\nsupport of the government or had sold supplies for the Revolutionary\r\narmy was well known. It was also a matter of common knowledge that a\r\nvery large part of these bonds had been bought by speculators at ruinous\r\nfigures--ten, twenty, and thirty cents on the dollar. Accordingly, it\r\nhad been suggested, even in very respectable quarters, that a\r\ndiscrimination should be made between original holders and speculative\r\npurchasers. Some who held this opinion urged that the speculators who\r\nhad paid nominal sums for their bonds should be reimbursed for their\r\noutlays and the original holders paid the difference; others said that\r\nthe government should \"scale the debt\" by redeeming, not at full value\r\nbut at a figure reasonably above the market price. Against the\r\nproposition Hamilton set his face like flint. He maintained that the\r\ngovernment was honestly bound to redeem every bond at its face value,\r\nalthough the difficulty of securing revenue made necessary a lower rate\r\nof interest on a part of the bonds and the deferring of interest on\r\nanother part.\r\n\r\n=Funding and Assumption Carried.=--There was little difficulty in\r\nsecuring the approval of both houses of Congress for the funding of the\r\nnational debt at full value. The bill for the assumption of state debts,\r\nhowever, brought the sharpest division of opinions. To the Southern\r\nmembers of Congress assumption was a gross violation of states' rights,\r\nwithout any warrant in the Constitution and devised in the interest of\r\nNorthern speculators who, anticipating assumption and funding, had\r\nbought up at low prices the Southern bonds and other promises to pay.\r\nNew England, on the other hand, was strongly in favor of assumption;\r\nseveral representatives from that section were rash enough to threaten a\r\ndissolution of the union if the bill was defeated. To this dispute was\r\nadded an equally bitter quarrel over the location of the national\r\ncapital, then temporarily at New York City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST UNITED STATES BANK AT PHILADELPHIA]\r\n\r\nA deadlock, accompanied by the most surly feelings on both sides,\r\nthreatened the very existence of the young government. Washington and\r\nHamilton were thoroughly alarmed. Hearing of the extremity to which the\r\ncontest had been carried and acting on the appeal from the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, Jefferson intervened at this point. By skillful management\r\nat a good dinner he brought the opposing leaders together; and thus once\r\nmore, as on many other occasions, peace was purchased and the union\r\nsaved by compromise. The bargain this time consisted of an exchange of\r\nvotes for assumption in return for votes for the capital. Enough\r\nSouthern members voted for assumption to pass the bill, and a majority\r\nwas mustered in favor of building the capital on the banks of the\r\nPotomac, after locating it for a ten-year period at Philadelphia to\r\nsatisfy Pennsylvania members.\r\n\r\n=The United States Bank.=--Encouraged by the success of his funding and\r\nassumption measures, Hamilton laid before Congress a project for a great\r\nUnited States Bank. He proposed that a private corporation be chartered\r\nby Congress, authorized to raise a capital stock of $10,000,000\r\n(three-fourths in new six per cent federal bonds and one-fourth in\r\nspecie) and empowered to issue paper currency under proper safeguards.\r\nMany advantages, Hamilton contended, would accrue to the government from\r\nthis institution. The price of the government bonds would be increased,\r\nthus enhancing public credit. A national currency would be created of\r\nuniform value from one end of the land to the other. The branches of the\r\nbank in various cities would make easy the exchange of funds so vital to\r\ncommercial transactions on a national scale. Finally, through the issue\r\nof bank notes, the money capital available for agriculture and industry\r\nwould be increased, thus stimulating business enterprise. Jefferson\r\nhotly attacked the bank on the ground that Congress had no power\r\nwhatever under the Constitution to charter such a private corporation.\r\nHamilton defended it with great cogency. Washington, after weighing all\r\nopinions, decided in favor of the proposal. In 1791 the bill\r\nestablishing the first United States Bank for a period of twenty years\r\nbecame a law.\r\n\r\n=The Protective Tariff.=--A third part of Hamilton's program was the\r\nprotection of American industries. The first revenue act of 1789, though\r\ndesigned primarily to bring money into the empty treasury, declared in\r\nfavor of the principle. The following year Washington referred to the\r\nsubject in his address to Congress. Thereupon Hamilton was instructed to\r\nprepare recommendations for legislative action. The result, after a\r\ndelay of more than a year, was his _Report on Manufactures_, another\r\nstate paper worthy, in closeness of reasoning and keenness of\r\nunderstanding, of a place beside his report on public credit. Hamilton\r\nbased his argument on the broadest national grounds: the protective\r\ntariff would, by encouraging the building of factories, create a home\r\nmarket for the produce of farms and plantations; by making the United\r\nStates independent of other countries in times of peace, it would double\r\nits security in time of war; by making use of the labor of women and\r\nchildren, it would turn to the production of goods persons otherwise\r\nidle or only partly employed; by increasing the trade between the North\r\nand South it would strengthen the links of union and add to political\r\nties those of commerce and intercourse. The revenue measure of 1792 bore\r\nthe impress of these arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n\r\n=Dissensions over Hamilton's Measures.=--Hamilton's plans, touching\r\ndeeply as they did the resources of individuals and the interests of the\r\nstates, awakened alarm and opposition. Funding at face value, said his\r\ncritics, was a government favor to speculators; the assumption of state\r\ndebts was a deep design to undermine the state governments; Congress had\r\nno constitutional power to create a bank; the law creating the bank\r\nmerely allowed a private corporation to make paper money and lend it at\r\na high rate of interest; and the tariff was a tax on land and labor for\r\nthe benefit of manufacturers.\r\n\r\nHamilton's reply to this bill of indictment was simple and\r\nstraightforward. Some rascally speculators had profited from the funding\r\nof the debt at face value, but that was only an incident in the\r\nrestoration of public credit. In view of the jealousies of the states it\r\nwas a good thing to reduce their powers and pretensions. The\r\nConstitution was not to be interpreted narrowly but in the full light of\r\nnational needs. The bank would enlarge the amount of capital so sorely\r\nneeded to start up American industries, giving markets to farmers and\r\nplanters. The tariff by creating a home market and increasing\r\nopportunities for employment would benefit both land and labor. Out of\r\nsuch wise policies firmly pursued by the government, he concluded, were\r\nbound to come strength and prosperity for the new government at home,\r\ncredit and power abroad. This view Washington fully indorsed, adding\r\nthe weight of his great name to the inherent merits of the measures\r\nadopted under his administration.\r\n\r\n=The Sharpness of the Partisan Conflict.=--As a result of the clash of\r\nopinion, the people of the country gradually divided into two parties:\r\nFederalists and Anti-Federalists, the former led by Hamilton, the latter\r\nby Jefferson. The strength of the Federalists lay in the cities--Boston,\r\nProvidence, Hartford, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston--among the\r\nmanufacturing, financial, and commercial groups of the population who\r\nwere eager to extend their business operations. The strength of the\r\nAnti-Federalists lay mainly among the debt-burdened farmers who feared\r\nthe growth of what they called \"a money power\" and planters in all\r\nsections who feared the dominance of commercial and manufacturing\r\ninterests. The farming and planting South, outside of the few towns,\r\nfinally presented an almost solid front against assumption, the bank,\r\nand the tariff. The conflict between the parties grew steadily in\r\nbitterness, despite the conciliatory and engaging manner in which\r\nHamilton presented his cause in his state papers and despite the\r\nconstant efforts of Washington to soften the asperity of the\r\ncontestants.\r\n\r\n=The Leadership and Doctrines of Jefferson.=--The party dispute had not\r\ngone far before the opponents of the administration began to look to\r\nJefferson as their leader. Some of Hamilton's measures he had approved,\r\ndeclaring afterward that he did not at the time understand their\r\nsignificance. Others, particularly the bank, he fiercely assailed. More\r\nthan once, he and Hamilton, shaking violently with anger, attacked each\r\nother at cabinet meetings, and nothing short of the grave and dignified\r\npleas of Washington prevented an early and open break between them. In\r\n1794 it finally came. Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State and\r\nretired to his home in Virginia to assume, through correspondence and\r\nnegotiation, the leadership of the steadily growing party of opposition.\r\n\r\nShy and modest in manner, halting in speech, disliking the turmoil of\r\npublic debate, and deeply interested in science and philosophy,\r\nJefferson was not very well fitted for the strenuous life of political\r\ncontest. Nevertheless, he was an ambitious and shrewd negotiator. He was\r\nalso by honest opinion and matured conviction the exact opposite of\r\nHamilton. The latter believed in a strong, active, \"high-toned\"\r\ngovernment, vigorously compelling in all its branches. Jefferson looked\r\nupon such government as dangerous to the liberties of citizens and\r\nopenly avowed his faith in the desirability of occasional popular\r\nuprisings. Hamilton distrusted the people. \"Your people is a great\r\nbeast,\" he is reported to have said. Jefferson professed his faith in\r\nthe people with an abandon that was considered reckless in his time.\r\n\r\nOn economic matters, the opinions of the two leaders were also\r\nhopelessly at variance. Hamilton, while cherishing agriculture, desired\r\nto see America a great commercial and industrial nation. Jefferson was\r\nequally set against this course for his country. He feared the\r\naccumulation of riches and the growth of a large urban working class.\r\nThe mobs of great cities, he said, are sores on the body politic;\r\nartisans are usually the dangerous element that make revolutions;\r\nworkshops should be kept in Europe and with them the artisans with their\r\ninsidious morals and manners. The only substantial foundation for a\r\nrepublic, Jefferson believed to be agriculture. The spirit of\r\nindependence could be kept alive only by free farmers, owning the land\r\nthey tilled and looking to the sun in heaven and the labor of their\r\nhands for their sustenance. Trusting as he did in the innate goodness of\r\nhuman nature when nourished on a free soil, Jefferson advocated those\r\nmeasures calculated to favor agriculture and to enlarge the rights of\r\npersons rather than the powers of government. Thus he became the\r\nchampion of the individual against the interference of the government,\r\nand an ardent advocate of freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and\r\nfreedom of scientific inquiry. It was, accordingly, no mere factious\r\nspirit that drove him into opposition to Hamilton.\r\n\r\n=The Whisky Rebellion.=--The political agitation of the Anti-Federalists\r\nwas accompanied by an armed revolt against the government in 1794. The\r\noccasion for this uprising was another of Hamilton's measures, a law\r\nlaying an excise tax on distilled spirits, for the purpose of increasing\r\nthe revenue needed to pay the interest on the funded debt. It so\r\nhappened that a very considerable part of the whisky manufactured in the\r\ncountry was made by the farmers, especially on the frontier, in their\r\nown stills. The new revenue law meant that federal officers would now\r\ncome into the homes of the people, measure their liquor, and take the\r\ntax out of their pockets. All the bitterness which farmers felt against\r\nthe fiscal measures of the government was redoubled. In the western\r\ndistricts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina, they refused to\r\npay the tax. In Pennsylvania, some of them sacked and burned the houses\r\nof the tax collectors, as the Revolutionists thirty years before had\r\nmobbed the agents of King George sent over to sell stamps. They were in\r\na fair way to nullify the law in whole districts when Washington called\r\nout the troops to suppress \"the Whisky Rebellion.\" Then the movement\r\ncollapsed; but it left behind a deep-seated resentment which flared up\r\nin the election of several obdurate Anti-Federalist Congressmen from the\r\ndisaffected regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN INFLUENCES AND DOMESTIC POLITICS\r\n\r\n=The French Revolution.=--In this exciting period, when all America was\r\ndistracted by partisan disputes, a storm broke in Europe--the\r\nepoch-making French Revolution--which not only shook the thrones of the\r\nOld World but stirred to its depths the young republic of the New World.\r\nThe first scene in this dramatic affair occurred in the spring of 1789,\r\na few days after Washington was inaugurated. The king of France, Louis\r\nXVI, driven into bankruptcy by extravagance and costly wars, was forced\r\nto resort to his people for financial help. Accordingly he called, for\r\nthe first time in more than one hundred fifty years, a meeting of the\r\nnational parliament, the \"Estates General,\" composed of representatives\r\nof the \"three estates\"--the clergy, nobility, and commoners. Acting\r\nunder powerful leaders, the commoners, or \"third estate,\" swept aside\r\nthe clergy and nobility and resolved themselves into a national\r\nassembly. This stirred the country to its depths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nLOUIS XVI IN THE HANDS OF THE MOB]\r\n\r\nGreat events followed in swift succession. On July 14, 1789, the\r\nBastille, an old royal prison, symbol of the king's absolutism, was\r\nstormed by a Paris crowd and destroyed. On the night of August 4, the\r\nfeudal privileges of the nobility were abolished by the national\r\nassembly amid great excitement. A few days later came the famous\r\nDeclaration of the Rights of Man, proclaiming the sovereignty of the\r\npeople and the privileges of citizens. In the autumn of 1791, Louis XVI\r\nwas forced to accept a new constitution for France vesting the\r\nlegislative power in a popular assembly. Little disorder accompanied\r\nthese startling changes. To all appearances a peaceful revolution had\r\nstripped the French king of his royal prerogatives and based the\r\ngovernment of his country on the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\n=American Influence in France.=--In undertaking their great political\r\nrevolt the French had been encouraged by the outcome of the American\r\nRevolution. Officers and soldiers, who had served in the American war,\r\nreported to their French countrymen marvelous tales. At the frugal table\r\nof General Washington, in council with the unpretentious Franklin, or at\r\nconferences over the strategy of war, French noblemen of ancient lineage\r\nlearned to respect both the talents and the simple character of the\r\nleaders in the great republican commonwealth beyond the seas. Travelers,\r\nwho had gone to see the experiment in republicanism with their own eyes,\r\ncarried home to the king and ruling class stories of an astounding\r\nsystem of popular government.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the dalliance with American democracy was regarded by\r\nFrench conservatives as playing with fire. \"When we think of the false\r\nideas of government and philanthropy,\" wrote one of Lafayette's aides,\r\n\"which these youths acquired in America and propagated in France with so\r\nmuch enthusiasm and such deplorable success--for this mania of imitation\r\npowerfully aided the Revolution, though it was not the sole cause of\r\nit--we are bound to confess that it would have been better, both for\r\nthemselves and for us, if these young philosophers in red-heeled shoes\r\nhad stayed at home in attendance on the court.\"\r\n\r\n=Early American Opinion of the French Revolution.=--So close were the\r\nties between the two nations that it is not surprising to find every\r\nstep in the first stages of the French Revolution greeted with applause\r\nin the United States. \"Liberty will have another feather in her cap,\"\r\nexultantly wrote a Boston editor. \"In no part of the globe,\" soberly\r\nwrote John Marshall, \"was this revolution hailed with more joy than in\r\nAmerica.... But one sentiment existed.\" The main key to the Bastille,\r\nsent to Washington as a memento, was accepted as \"a token of the\r\nvictory gained by liberty.\" Thomas Paine saw in the great event \"the\r\nfirst ripe fruits of American principles transplanted into Europe.\"\r\nFederalists and Anti-Federalists regarded the new constitution of France\r\nas another vindication of American ideals.\r\n\r\n=The Reign of Terror.=--While profuse congratulations were being\r\nexchanged, rumors began to come that all was not well in France. Many\r\nnoblemen, enraged at the loss of their special privileges, fled into\r\nGermany and plotted an invasion of France to overthrow the new system of\r\ngovernment. Louis XVI entered into negotiations with his brother\r\nmonarchs on the continent to secure their help in the same enterprise,\r\nand he finally betrayed to the French people his true sentiments by\r\nattempting to escape from his kingdom, only to be captured and taken\r\nback to Paris in disgrace.\r\n\r\nA new phase of the revolution now opened. The working people, excluded\r\nfrom all share in the government by the first French constitution,\r\nbecame restless, especially in Paris. Assembling on the Champs de Mars,\r\na great open field, they signed a petition calling for another\r\nconstitution giving them the suffrage. When told to disperse, they\r\nrefused and were fired upon by the national guard. This \"massacre,\" as\r\nit was called, enraged the populace. A radical party, known as\r\n\"Jacobins,\" then sprang up, taking its name from a Jacobin monastery in\r\nwhich it held its sessions. In a little while it became the master of\r\nthe popular convention convoked in September, 1792. The monarchy was\r\nimmediately abolished and a republic established. On January 21, 1793,\r\nLouis was sent to the scaffold. To the war on Austria, already raging,\r\nwas added a war on England. Then came the Reign of Terror, during which\r\nradicals in possession of the convention executed in large numbers\r\ncounter-revolutionists and those suspected of sympathy with the\r\nmonarchy. They shot down peasants who rose in insurrection against their\r\nrule and established a relentless dictatorship. Civil war followed.\r\nTerrible atrocities were committed on both sides in the name of liberty,\r\nand in the name of monarchy. To Americans of conservative temper it now\r\nseemed that the Revolution, so auspiciously begun, had degenerated into\r\nanarchy and mere bloodthirsty strife.\r\n\r\n=Burke Summons the World to War on France.=--In England, Edmund Burke\r\nled the fight against the new French principles which he feared might\r\nspread to all Europe. In his _Reflections on the French Revolution_,\r\nwritten in 1790, he attacked with terrible wrath the whole program of\r\npopular government; he called for war, relentless war, upon the French\r\nas monsters and outlaws; he demanded that they be reduced to order by\r\nthe restoration of the king to full power under the protection of the\r\narms of European nations.\r\n\r\n=Paine's Defense of the French Revolution.=--To counteract the campaign\r\nof hate against the French, Thomas Paine replied to Burke in another of\r\nhis famous tracts, _The Rights of Man_, which was given to the American\r\npublic in an edition containing a letter of approval from Jefferson.\r\nBurke, said Paine, had been mourning about the glories of the French\r\nmonarchy and aristocracy but had forgotten the starving peasants and the\r\noppressed people; had wept over the plumage and neglected the dying\r\nbird. Burke had denied the right of the French people to choose their\r\nown governors, blandly forgetting that the English government in which\r\nhe saw final perfection itself rested on two revolutions. He had boasted\r\nthat the king of England held his crown in contempt of the democratic\r\nsocieties. Paine answered: \"If I ask a man in America if he wants a\r\nking, he retorts and asks me if I take him for an idiot.\" To the charge\r\nthat the doctrines of the rights of man were \"new fangled,\" Paine\r\nreplied that the question was not whether they were new or old but\r\nwhether they were right or wrong. As to the French disorders and\r\ndifficulties, he bade the world wait to see what would be brought forth\r\nin due time.\r\n\r\n=The Effect of the French Revolution on American Politics.=--The course\r\nof the French Revolution and the controversies accompanying it,\r\nexercised a profound influence on the formation of the first political\r\nparties in America. The followers of Hamilton, now proud of the name\r\n\"Federalists,\" drew back in fright as they heard of the cruel deeds\r\ncommitted during the Reign of Terror. They turned savagely upon the\r\nrevolutionists and their friends in America, denouncing as \"Jacobin\"\r\neverybody who did not condemn loudly enough the proceedings of the\r\nFrench Republic. A Massachusetts preacher roundly assailed \"the\r\natheistical, anarchical, and in other respects immoral principles of the\r\nFrench Republicans\"; he then proceeded with equal passion to attack\r\nJefferson and the Anti-Federalists, whom he charged with spreading false\r\nFrench propaganda and betraying America. \"The editors, patrons, and\r\nabettors of these vehicles of slander,\" he exclaimed, \"ought to be\r\nconsidered and treated as enemies to their country.... Of all traitors\r\nthey are the most aggravatedly criminal; of all villains, they are the\r\nmost infamous and detestable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Federalists, as a matter of fact, were generally favorable to\r\nthe Revolution although they deplored many of the events associated with\r\nit. Paine's pamphlet, indorsed by Jefferson, was widely read. Democratic\r\nsocieties, after the fashion of French political clubs, arose in the\r\ncities; the coalition of European monarchs against France was denounced\r\nas a coalition against the very principles of republicanism; and the\r\nexecution of Louis XVI was openly celebrated at a banquet in\r\nPhiladelphia. Harmless titles, such as \"Sir,\" \"the Honorable,\" and \"His\r\nExcellency,\" were decried as aristocratic and some of the more excited\r\ninsisted on adopting the French title, \"Citizen,\" speaking, for example,\r\nof \"Citizen Judge\" and \"Citizen Toastmaster.\" Pamphlets in defense of\r\nthe French streamed from the press, while subsidized newspapers kept the\r\npropaganda in full swing.\r\n\r\n=The European War Disturbs American Commerce.=--This battle of wits, or\r\nrather contest in calumny, might have gone on indefinitely in America\r\nwithout producing any serious results, had it not been for the war\r\nbetween England and France, then raging. The English, having command of\r\nthe seas, claimed the right to seize American produce bound for French\r\nports and to confiscate American ships engaged in carrying French goods.\r\nAdding fuel to a fire already hot enough, they began to search American\r\nships and to carry off British-born sailors found on board American\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n=The French Appeal for Help.=--At the same time the French Republic\r\nturned to the United States for aid in its war on England and sent over\r\nas its diplomatic representative \"Citizen\" Genêt, an ardent supporter of\r\nthe new order. On his arrival at Charleston, he was greeted with fervor\r\nby the Anti-Federalists. As he made his way North, he was wined and\r\ndined and given popular ovations that turned his head. He thought the\r\nwhole country was ready to join the French Republic in its contest with\r\nEngland. Genêt therefore attempted to use the American ports as the base\r\nof operations for French privateers preying on British merchant ships;\r\nand he insisted that the United States was in honor bound to help France\r\nunder the treaty of 1778.\r\n\r\n=The Proclamation of Neutrality and the Jay Treaty.=--Unmoved by the\r\nrising tide of popular sympathy for France, Washington took a firm\r\ncourse. He received Genêt coldly. The demand that the United States aid\r\nFrance under the old treaty of alliance he answered by proclaiming the\r\nneutrality of America and warning American citizens against hostile acts\r\ntoward either France or England. When Genêt continued to hold meetings,\r\nissue manifestoes, and stir up the people against England, Washington\r\nasked the French government to recall him. This act he followed up by\r\nsending the Chief Justice, John Jay, on a pacific mission to England.\r\n\r\nThe result was the celebrated Jay treaty of 1794. By its terms Great\r\nBritain agreed to withdraw her troops from the western forts where they\r\nhad been since the war for independence and to grant certain slight\r\ntrade concessions. The chief sources of bitterness--the failure of the\r\nBritish to return slaves carried off during the Revolution, the seizure\r\nof American ships, and the impressment of sailors--were not touched,\r\nmuch to the distress of everybody in America, including loyal\r\nFederalists. Nevertheless, Washington, dreading an armed conflict with\r\nEngland, urged the Senate to ratify the treaty. The weight of his\r\ninfluence carried the day.\r\n\r\nAt this, the hostility of the Anti-Federalists knew no bounds. Jefferson\r\ndeclared the Jay treaty \"an infamous act which is really nothing more\r\nthan an alliance between England and the Anglo-men of this country,\r\nagainst the legislature and the people of the United States.\" Hamilton,\r\ndefending it with his usual courage, was stoned by a mob in New York and\r\ndriven from the platform with blood streaming from his face. Jay was\r\nburned in effigy. Even Washington was not spared. The House of\r\nRepresentatives was openly hostile. To display its feelings, it called\r\nupon the President for the papers relative to the treaty negotiations,\r\nonly to be more highly incensed by his flat refusal to present them, on\r\nthe ground that the House did not share in the treaty-making power.\r\n\r\n=Washington Retires from Politics.=--Such angry contests confirmed the\r\nPresident in his slowly maturing determination to retire at the end of\r\nhis second term in office. He did not believe that a third term was\r\nunconstitutional or improper; but, worn out by his long and arduous\r\nlabors in war and in peace and wounded by harsh attacks from former\r\nfriends, he longed for the quiet of his beautiful estate at Mount\r\nVernon.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1796, on the eve of the presidential election, Washington\r\nissued his Farewell Address, another state paper to be treasured and\r\nread by generations of Americans to come. In this address he directed\r\nthe attention of the people to three subjects of lasting interest. He\r\nwarned them against sectional jealousies. He remonstrated against the\r\nspirit of partisanship, saying that in government \"of the popular\r\ncharacter, in government purely elective, it is a spirit not to be\r\nencouraged.\" He likewise cautioned the people against \"the insidious\r\nwiles of foreign influence,\" saying: \"Europe has a set of primary\r\ninterests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she\r\nmust be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are\r\nessentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it would be\r\nunwise in us to implicate ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary\r\nvicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions\r\nof her friendships or enmities.... Why forego the advantages of so\r\npeculiar a situation?... It is our true policy to steer clear of\r\npermanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world.... Taking\r\ncare always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on a\r\nrespectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary\r\nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\"\r\n\r\n=The Campaign of 1796--Adams Elected.=--On hearing of the retirement of\r\nWashington, the Anti-Federalists cast off all restraints. In honor of\r\nFrance and in opposition to what they were pleased to call the\r\nmonarchical tendencies of the Federalists, they boldly assumed the name\r\n\"Republican\"; the term \"Democrat,\" then applied only to obscure and\r\ndespised radicals, had not come into general use. They selected\r\nJefferson as their candidate for President against John Adams, the\r\nFederalist nominee, and carried on such a spirited campaign that they\r\ncame within four votes of electing him.\r\n\r\nThe successful candidate, Adams, was not fitted by training or opinion\r\nfor conciliating a determined opposition. He was a reserved and studious\r\nman. He was neither a good speaker nor a skillful negotiator. In one of\r\nhis books he had declared himself in favor of \"government by an\r\naristocracy of talents and wealth\"--an offense which the Republicans\r\nnever forgave. While John Marshall found him \"a sensible, plain, candid,\r\ngood-tempered man,\" Jefferson could see in him nothing but a \"monocrat\"\r\nand \"Anglo-man.\" Had it not been for the conduct of the French\r\ngovernment, Adams would hardly have enjoyed a moment's genuine\r\npopularity during his administration.\r\n\r\n=The Quarrel with France.=--The French Directory, the executive\r\ndepartment established under the constitution of 1795, managed, however,\r\nto stir the anger of Republicans and Federalists alike. It regarded the\r\nJay treaty as a rebuke to France and a flagrant violation of obligations\r\nsolemnly registered in the treaty of 1778. Accordingly it refused to\r\nreceive the American minister, treated him in a humiliating way, and\r\nfinally told him to leave the country. Overlooking this affront in his\r\nanxiety to maintain peace, Adams dispatched to France a commission of\r\neminent men with instructions to reach an understanding with the French\r\nRepublic. On their arrival, they were chagrined to find, instead of a\r\ndecent reception, an indirect demand for an apology respecting the past\r\nconduct of the American government, a payment in cash, and an annual\r\ntribute as the price of continued friendship. When the news of this\r\naffair reached President Adams, he promptly laid it before Congress,\r\nreferring to the Frenchmen who had made the demands as \"Mr. X, Mr. Y,\r\nand Mr. Z.\"\r\n\r\nThis insult, coupled with the fact that French privateers, like the\r\nBritish, were preying upon American commerce, enraged even the\r\nRepublicans who had been loudest in the profession of their French\r\nsympathies. They forgot their wrath over the Jay treaty and joined with\r\nthe Federalists in shouting: \"Millions for defense, not a cent for\r\ntribute!\" Preparations for war were made on every hand. Washington was\r\nonce more called from Mount Vernon to take his old position at the head\r\nof the army. Indeed, fighting actually began upon the high seas and went\r\non without a formal declaration of war until the year 1800. By that time\r\nthe Directory had been overthrown. A treaty was readily made with\r\nNapoleon, the First Consul, who was beginning his remarkable career as\r\nchief of the French Republic, soon to be turned into an empire.\r\n\r\n=Alien and Sedition Laws.=--Flushed with success, the Federalists\r\ndetermined, if possible, to put an end to radical French influence in\r\nAmerica and to silence Republican opposition. They therefore passed two\r\ndrastic laws in the summer of 1798: the Alien and Sedition Acts.\r\n\r\nThe first of these measures empowered the President to expel from the\r\ncountry or to imprison any alien whom he regarded as \"dangerous\" or \"had\r\nreasonable grounds to suspect\" of \"any treasonable or secret\r\nmachinations against the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe second of the measures, the Sedition Act, penalized not only those\r\nwho attempted to stir up unlawful combinations against the government\r\nbut also every one who wrote, uttered, or published \"any false,\r\nscandalous, and malicious writing ... against the government of the\r\nUnited States or either House of Congress, or the President of the\r\nUnited States, with intent to defame said government ... or to bring\r\nthem or either of them into contempt or disrepute.\" This measure was\r\nhurried through Congress in spite of the opposition and the clear\r\nprovision in the Constitution that Congress shall make no law abridging\r\nthe freedom of speech or of the press. Even many Federalists feared the\r\nconsequences of the action. Hamilton was alarmed when he read the bill,\r\nexclaiming: \"Let us not establish a tyranny. Energy is a very different\r\nthing from violence.\" John Marshall told his friends in Virginia that,\r\nhad he been in Congress, he would have opposed the two bills because he\r\nthought them \"useless\" and \"calculated to create unnecessary discontents\r\nand jealousies.\"\r\n\r\nThe Alien law was not enforced; but it gave great offense to the Irish\r\nand French whose activities against the American government's policy\r\nrespecting Great Britain put them in danger of prison. The Sedition law,\r\non the other hand, was vigorously applied. Several editors of Republican\r\nnewspapers soon found themselves in jail or broken by ruinous fines for\r\ntheir caustic criticisms of the Federalist President and his policies.\r\nBystanders at political meetings, who uttered sentiments which, though\r\nungenerous and severe, seem harmless enough now, were hurried before\r\nFederalist judges and promptly fined and imprisoned. Although the\r\nprosecutions were not numerous, they aroused a keen resentment. The\r\nRepublicans were convinced that their political opponents, having\r\nsaddled upon the country Hamilton's fiscal system and the British\r\ntreaty, were bent on silencing all censure. The measures therefore had\r\nexactly the opposite effect from that which their authors intended.\r\nInstead of helping the Federalist party, they made criticism of it more\r\nbitter than ever.\r\n\r\n=The Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.=--Jefferson was quick to take\r\nadvantage of the discontent. He drafted a set of resolutions declaring\r\nthe Sedition law null and void, as violating the federal Constitution.\r\nHis resolutions were passed by the Kentucky legislature late in 1798,\r\nsigned by the governor, and transmitted to the other states for their\r\nconsideration. Though receiving unfavorable replies from a number of\r\nNorthern states, Kentucky the following year reaffirmed its position and\r\ndeclared that the nullification of all unconstitutional acts of Congress\r\nwas the rightful remedy to be used by the states in the redress of\r\ngrievances. It thus defied the federal government and announced a\r\ndoctrine hostile to nationality and fraught with terrible meaning for\r\nthe future. In the neighboring state of Virginia, Madison led a movement\r\nagainst the Alien and Sedition laws. He induced the legislature to pass\r\nresolutions condemning the acts as unconstitutional and calling upon the\r\nother states to take proper means to preserve their rights and the\r\nrights of the people.\r\n\r\n=The Republican Triumph in 1800.=--Thus the way was prepared for the\r\nelection of 1800. The Republicans left no stone unturned in their\r\nefforts to place on the Federalist candidate, President Adams, all the\r\nodium of the Alien and Sedition laws, in addition to responsibility for\r\napproving Hamilton's measures and policies. The Federalists, divided in\r\ncouncils and cold in their affection for Adams, made a poor campaign.\r\nThey tried to discredit their opponents with epithets of \"Jacobins\" and\r\n\"Anarchists\"--terms which had been weakened by excessive use. When the\r\nvote was counted, it was found that Adams had been defeated; while the\r\nRepublicans had carried the entire South and New York also and secured\r\neight of the fifteen electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania. \"Our beloved\r\nAdams will now close his bright career,\" lamented a Federalist\r\nnewspaper. \"Sons of faction, demagogues and high priests of anarchy, now\r\nyou have cause to triumph!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _An old cartoon_\r\n\r\nA QUARREL BETWEEN A FEDERALIST AND A REPUBLICAN IN THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES]\r\n\r\nJefferson's election, however, was still uncertain. By a curious\r\nprovision in the Constitution, presidential electors were required to\r\nvote for two persons without indicating which office each was to fill,\r\nthe one receiving the highest number of votes to be President and the\r\ncandidate standing next to be Vice President. It so happened that Aaron\r\nBurr, the Republican candidate for Vice President, had received the same\r\nnumber of votes as Jefferson; as neither had a majority the election was\r\nthrown into the House of Representatives, where the Federalists held the\r\nbalance of power. Although it was well known that Burr was not even a\r\ncandidate for President, his friends and many Federalists began\r\nintriguing for his election to that high office. Had it not been for the\r\nvigorous action of Hamilton the prize might have been snatched out of\r\nJefferson's hands. Not until the thirty-sixth ballot on February 17,\r\n1801, was the great issue decided in his favor.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nJ.S.

Their attachment to\r\nAmerica was, certainly, as strong as that of Hamilton; but they regarded\r\nthe state, rather than the national government, as the proper center of\r\npower and affection. Indeed, a large part of the rank and file had been\r\namong the opponents of the Constitution in the days of its adoption.\r\nJefferson had entertained doubts about it and Monroe, destined to be the\r\nfifth President, had been one of the bitter foes of ratification. The\r\nformer went so far in the direction of local autonomy that he exalted\r\nthe state above the nation in the Kentucky resolutions of 1798,\r\ndeclaring the Constitution to be a mere compact and the states competent\r\nto interpret and nullify federal law. This was provincialism with a\r\nvengeance. \"It is jealousy, not confidence, which prescribes limited\r\nconstitutions,\" wrote Jefferson for the Kentucky legislature. Jealousy\r\nof the national government, not confidence in it--this is the ideal that\r\nreflected the provincial and agricultural interest.\r\n\r\n=Republican Simplicity.=--Every act of the Jeffersonian party during its\r\nearly days of power was in accord with the ideals of government which it\r\nprofessed. It had opposed all pomp and ceremony, calculated to give\r\nweight and dignity to the chief executive of the nation, as symbols of\r\nmonarchy and high prerogative. Appropriately, therefore, Jefferson's\r\ninauguration on March 4, 1801, the first at the new capital at\r\nWashington, was marked by extreme simplicity. In keeping with this\r\nprocedure he quit the practice, followed by Washington and Adams, of\r\nreading presidential addresses to Congress in joint assembly and adopted\r\nin its stead the plan of sending his messages in writing--a custom that\r\nwas continued unbroken until 1913 when President Wilson returned to the\r\nexample set by the first chief magistrate.\r\n\r\n=Republican Measures.=--The Republicans had complained of a great\r\nnational debt as the source of a dangerous \"money power,\" giving\r\nstrength to the federal government; accordingly they began to pay it off\r\nas rapidly as possible. They had held commerce in low esteem and looked\r\nupon a large navy as a mere device to protect it; consequently they\r\nreduced the number of warships. They had objected to excise taxes,\r\nparticularly on whisky; these they quickly abolished, to the intense\r\nsatisfaction of the farmers. They had protested against the heavy cost\r\nof the federal government; they reduced expenses by discharging hundreds\r\nof men from the army and abolishing many offices.\r\n\r\nThey had savagely criticized the Sedition law and Jefferson refused to\r\nenforce it. They had been deeply offended by the assault on freedom of\r\nspeech and press and they promptly impeached Samuel Chase, a justice of\r\nthe Supreme Court, who had been especially severe in his attacks upon\r\noffenders under the Sedition Act. Their failure to convict Justice Chase\r\nby a narrow margin was due to no lack of zeal on their part but to the\r\nFederalist strength in the Senate where the trial was held. They had\r\nregarded the appointment of a large number of federal judges during the\r\nlast hours of Adams' administration as an attempt to intrench\r\nFederalists in the judiciary and to enlarge the sphere of the national\r\ngovernment. Accordingly, they at once repealed the act creating the new\r\njudgeships, thus depriving the \"midnight appointees\" of their posts.\r\nThey had considered the federal offices, civil and military, as sources\r\nof great strength to the Federalists and Jefferson, though committed to\r\nthe principle that offices should be open to all and distributed\r\naccording to merit, was careful to fill most of the vacancies as they\r\noccurred with trusted Republicans. To his credit, however, it must be\r\nsaid that he did not make wholesale removals to find room for party\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans thus hewed to the line of their general policy of\r\nrestricting the weight, dignity, and activity of the national\r\ngovernment. Yet there were no Republicans, as the Federalists asserted,\r\nprepared to urge serious modifications in the Constitution. \"If there be\r\nany among us who wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican\r\nform,\" wrote Jefferson in his first inaugural, \"let them stand\r\nundisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may\r\nbe tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" After reciting the\r\nfortunate circumstances of climate, soil, and isolation which made the\r\nfuture of America so full of promise, Jefferson concluded: \"A wise and\r\nfrugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another,\r\nshall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of\r\nindustry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the\r\nbread it has earned. This is the sum of good government; and this is\r\nnecessary to close the circle of our felicities.\"\r\n\r\nIn all this the Republicans had not reckoned with destiny. In a few\r\nshort years that lay ahead it was their fate to double the territory of\r\nthe country, making inevitable a continental nation; to give the\r\nConstitution a generous interpretation that shocked many a Federalist;\r\nto wage war on behalf of American commerce; to reëstablish the hated\r\nUnited States Bank; to enact a high protective tariff; to see their\r\nFederalist opponents in their turn discredited as nullifiers and\r\nprovincials; to announce high national doctrines in foreign affairs; and\r\nto behold the Constitution exalted and defended against the pretensions\r\nof states by a son of old Virginia, John Marshall, Chief Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICANS AND THE GREAT WEST\r\n\r\n=Expansion and Land Hunger.=--The first of the great measures which\r\ndrove the Republicans out upon this new national course--the purchase\r\nof the Louisiana territory--was the product of circumstances rather than\r\nof their deliberate choosing. It was not the lack of land for his\r\ncherished farmers that led Jefferson to add such an immense domain to\r\nthe original possessions of the United States. In the Northwest\r\nterritory, now embracing Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin,\r\nand a portion of Minnesota, settlements were mainly confined to the\r\nnorth bank of the Ohio River. To the south, in Kentucky and Tennessee,\r\nwhere there were more than one hundred thousand white people who had\r\npushed over the mountains from Virginia and the Carolinas, there were\r\nstill wide reaches of untilled soil. The Alabama and Mississippi regions\r\nwere vast Indian frontiers of the state of Georgia, unsettled and almost\r\nunexplored. Even to the wildest imagination there seemed to be territory\r\nenough to satisfy the land hunger of the American people for a century\r\nto come.\r\n\r\n=The Significance of the Mississippi River.=--At all events the East,\r\nthen the center of power, saw no good reason for expansion. The planters\r\nof the Carolinas, the manufacturers of Pennsylvania, the importers of\r\nNew York, the shipbuilders of New England, looking to the seaboard and\r\nto Europe for trade, refinements, and sometimes their ideas of\r\ngovernment, were slow to appreciate the place of the West in national\r\neconomy. The better educated the Easterners were, the less, it seems,\r\nthey comprehended the destiny of the nation. Sons of Federalist fathers\r\nat Williams College, after a long debate decided by a vote of fifteen to\r\none that the purchase of Louisiana was undesirable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the pioneers of Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee,\r\nunlearned in books, saw with their own eyes the resources of the\r\nwilderness. Many of them had been across the Mississippi and had beheld\r\nthe rich lands awaiting the plow of the white man. Down the great river\r\nthey floated their wheat, corn, and bacon to ocean-going ships bound for\r\nthe ports of the seaboard or for Europe. The land journeys over the\r\nmountain barriers with bulky farm produce, they knew from experience,\r\nwere almost impossible, and costly at best. Nails, bolts of cloth, tea,\r\nand coffee could go or come that way, but not corn and bacon. A free\r\noutlet to the sea by the Mississippi was as essential to the pioneers of\r\nthe Kentucky region as the harbor of Boston to the merchant princes of\r\nthat metropolis.\r\n\r\n=Louisiana under Spanish Rule.=--For this reason they watched with deep\r\nsolicitude the fortunes of the Spanish king to whom, at the close of the\r\nSeven Years' War, had fallen the Louisiana territory stretching from New\r\nOrleans to the Rocky Mountains. While he controlled the mouth of the\r\nMississippi there was little to fear, for he had neither the army nor\r\nthe navy necessary to resist any invasion of American trade. Moreover,\r\nWashington had been able, by the exercise of great tact, to secure from\r\nSpain in 1795 a trading privilege through New Orleans which satisfied\r\nthe present requirements of the frontiersmen even if it did not allay\r\ntheir fears for the future. So things stood when a swift succession of\r\nevents altered the whole situation.\r\n\r\n=Louisiana Transferred to France.=--In July, 1802, a royal order from\r\nSpain instructed the officials at New Orleans to close the port to\r\nAmerican produce. About the same time a disturbing rumor, long current,\r\nwas confirmed--Napoleon had coerced Spain into returning Louisiana to\r\nFrance by a secret treaty signed in 1800. \"The scalers of the Alps and\r\nconquerors of Venice\" now looked across the sea for new scenes of\r\nadventure. The West was ablaze with excitement. A call for war ran\r\nthrough the frontier; expeditions were organized to prevent the landing\r\nof the French; and petitions for instant action flooded in upon\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\n=Jefferson Sees the Danger.=--Jefferson, the friend of France and sworn\r\nenemy of England, compelled to choose in the interest of America, never\r\nwinced. \"The cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France,\"\r\nhe wrote to Livingston, the American minister in Paris, \"works sorely on\r\nthe United States. It completely reverses all the political relations of\r\nthe United States and will form a new epoch in our political course....\r\nThere is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our\r\nnatural and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans through which the produce\r\nof three-eighths of our territory must pass to market.... France,\r\nplacing herself in that door, assumes to us an attitude of defiance.\r\nSpain might have retained it quietly for years. Her pacific\r\ndispositions, her feeble state would induce her to increase our\r\nfacilities there.... Not so can it ever be in the hands of France....\r\nThe day that France takes possession of New Orleans fixes the sentence\r\nwhich is to restrain her forever within her low water mark.... It seals\r\nthe union of the two nations who in conjunction can maintain exclusive\r\npossession of the ocean. From that moment we must marry ourselves to the\r\nBritish fleet and nation.... This is not a state of things we seek or\r\ndesire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by France, forces on us\r\nas necessarily as any other cause by the laws of nature brings on its\r\nnecessary effect.\"\r\n\r\n=Louisiana Purchased.=--Acting on this belief, but apparently seeing\r\nonly the Mississippi outlet at stake, Jefferson sent his friend, James\r\nMonroe, to France with the power to buy New Orleans and West Florida.\r\nBefore Monroe arrived, the regular minister, Livingston, had already\r\nconvinced Napoleon that it would be well to sell territory which might\r\nbe wrested from him at any moment by the British sea power, especially\r\nas the war, temporarily stopped by the peace of Amiens, was once more\r\nraging in Europe. Wise as he was in his day, Livingston had at first no\r\nthought of buying the whole Louisiana country. He was simply dazed when\r\nNapoleon offered to sell the entire domain and get rid of the business\r\naltogether. Though staggered by the proposal, he and Monroe decided to\r\naccept. On April 30, they signed the treaty of cession, agreeing to pay\r\n$11,250,000 in six per cent bonds and to discharge certain debts due\r\nFrench citizens, making in all approximately fifteen millions. Spain\r\nprotested, Napoleon's brother fumed, French newspapers objected; but the\r\ndeed was done.\r\n\r\n=Jefferson and His Constitutional Scruples.=--When the news of this\r\nextraordinary event reached the United States, the people were filled\r\nwith astonishment, and no one was more surprised than Jefferson himself.\r\nHe had thought of buying New Orleans and West Florida for a small sum,\r\nand now a vast domain had been dumped into the lap of the nation. He was\r\npuzzled. On looking into the Constitution he found not a line\r\nauthorizing the purchase of more territory and so he drafted an\r\namendment declaring \"Louisiana, as ceded by France,--a part of the\r\nUnited States.\" He had belabored the Federalists for piling up a big\r\nnational debt and he could hardly endure the thought of issuing more\r\nbonds himself.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his doubts came the news that Napoleon might withdraw\r\nfrom the bargain. Thoroughly alarmed by that, Jefferson pressed the\r\nSenate for a ratification of the treaty. He still clung to his original\r\nidea that the Constitution did not warrant the purchase; but he lamely\r\nconcluded: \"If our friends shall think differently, I shall certainly\r\nacquiesce with satisfaction; confident that the good sense of our\r\ncountry will correct the evil of construction when it shall produce ill\r\neffects.\" Thus the stanch advocate of \"strict interpretation\" cut loose\r\nfrom his own doctrine and intrusted the construction of the Constitution\r\nto \"the good sense\" of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n=The Treaty Ratified.=--This unusual transaction, so favorable to the\r\nWest, aroused the ire of the seaboard Federalists. Some denounced it as\r\nunconstitutional, easily forgetting Hamilton's masterly defense of the\r\nbank, also not mentioned in the Constitution. Others urged that, if \"the\r\nhowling wilderness\" ever should be settled, it would turn against the\r\nEast, form new commercial connections, and escape from federal control.\r\nStill others protested that the purchase would lead inevitably to the\r\ndominance of a \"hotch potch of wild men from the Far West.\" Federalists,\r\nwho thought \"the broad back of America\" could readily bear Hamilton's\r\nconsolidated debt, now went into agonies over a bond issue of less than\r\none-sixth of that amount. But in vain. Jefferson's party with a high\r\nhand carried the day. The Senate, after hearing the Federalist protest,\r\nratified the treaty. In December, 1803, the French flag was hauled down\r\nfrom the old government buildings in New Orleans and the Stars and\r\nStripes were hoisted as a sign that the land of Coronado, De Soto,\r\nMarquette, and La Salle had passed forever to the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1805]\r\n\r\nBy a single stroke, the original territory of the United States was more\r\nthan doubled. While the boundaries of the purchase were uncertain, it is\r\nsafe to say that the Louisiana territory included what is now Arkansas,\r\nMissouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large\r\nportions of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and\r\nWyoming. The farm lands that the friends of \"a little America\" on the\r\nseacoast declared a hopeless wilderness were, within a hundred years,\r\nfully occupied and valued at nearly seven billion dollars--almost five\r\nhundred times the price paid to Napoleon.\r\n\r\n=Western Explorations.=--Having taken the fateful step, Jefferson wisely\r\nbegan to make the most of it. He prepared for the opening of the new\r\ncountry by sending the Lewis and Clark expedition to explore it,\r\ndiscover its resources, and lay out an overland route through the\r\nMissouri Valley and across the Great Divide to the Pacific. The story of\r\nthis mighty exploit, which began in the spring of 1804 and ended in the\r\nautumn of 1806, was set down with skill and pains in the journal of\r\nLewis and Clark; when published even in a short form, it invited the\r\nforward-looking men of the East to take thought about the western\r\nempire. At the same time Zebulon Pike, in a series of journeys, explored\r\nthe sources of the Mississippi River and penetrated the Spanish\r\nterritories of the far Southwest. Thus scouts and pioneers continued the\r\nwork of diplomats.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICAN WAR FOR COMMERCIAL INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\n=The English and French Blockades.=--In addition to bringing Louisiana\r\nto the United States, the reopening of the European War in 1803, after a\r\nshort lull, renewed in an acute form the commercial difficulties that\r\nhad plagued the country all during the administrations of Washington and\r\nAdams. The Republicans were now plunged into the hornets' nest. The\r\nparty whose ardent spirits had burned Jay in effigy, stoned Hamilton for\r\ndefending his treaty, jeered Washington's proclamation of neutrality,\r\nand spoken bitterly of \"timid traders,\" could no longer take refuge in\r\ncriticism. It had to act.\r\n\r\nIts troubles took a serious turn in 1806. England, in a determined\r\neffort to bring France to her knees by starvation, declared the coast of\r\nEurope blockaded from Brest to the mouth of the Elbe River. Napoleon\r\nretaliated by his Berlin Decree of November, 1806, blockading the\r\nBritish Isles--a measure terrifying to American ship owners whose\r\nvessels were liable to seizure by any French rover, though Napoleon had\r\nno navy to make good his proclamation. Great Britain countered with a\r\nstill more irritating decree--the Orders in Council of 1807. It modified\r\nits blockade, but in so doing merely authorized American ships not\r\ncarrying munitions of war to complete their voyage to the Continent, on\r\ncondition of their stopping at a British port, securing a license, and\r\npaying a tax. This, responded Napoleon, was the height of insolence, and\r\nhe denounced it as a gross violation of international law. He then\r\nclosed the circle of American troubles by issuing his Milan Decree of\r\nDecember, 1807. This order declared that any ship which complied with\r\nthe British rules would be subject to seizure and confiscation by French\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\n=The Impressment of Seamen.=--That was not all. Great Britain, in dire\r\nneed of men for her navy, adopted the practice of stopping American\r\nships, searching them, and carrying away British-born sailors found on\r\nboard. British sailors were so badly treated, so cruelly flogged for\r\ntrivial causes, and so meanly fed that they fled in crowds to the\r\nAmerican marine. In many cases it was difficult to tell whether seamen\r\nwere English or American. They spoke the same language, so that language\r\nwas no test. Rovers on the deep and stragglers in the ports of both\r\ncountries, they frequently had no papers to show their nativity.\r\nMoreover, Great Britain held to the old rule--\"Once an Englishman,\r\nalways an Englishman\"--a doctrine rejected by the United States in\r\nfavor of the principle that a man could choose the nation to which he\r\nwould give allegiance. British sea captains, sometimes by mistake, and\r\noften enough with reckless indifference, carried away into servitude in\r\ntheir own navy genuine American citizens. The process itself, even when\r\nexecuted with all the civilities of law, was painful enough, for it\r\nmeant that American ships were forced to \"come to,\" and compelled to\r\nrest submissively under British guns until the searching party had pried\r\ninto records, questioned seamen, seized and handcuffed victims. Saints\r\ncould not have done this work without raising angry passions, and only\r\nsaints could have endured it with patience and fortitude.\r\n\r\nHad the enactment of the scenes been confined to the high seas and\r\nknowledge of them to rumors and newspaper stories, American resentment\r\nmight not have been so intense; but many a search and seizure was made\r\nin sight of land. British and French vessels patrolled the coasts,\r\nfiring on one another and chasing one another in American waters within\r\nthe three-mile limit. When, in the summer of 1807, the American frigate\r\n_Chesapeake_ refused to surrender men alleged to be deserters from King\r\nGeorge's navy, the British warship _Leopard_ opened fire, killing three\r\nmen and wounding eighteen more--an act which even the British ministry\r\ncould hardly excuse. If the French were less frequently the offenders,\r\nit was not because of their tenderness about American rights but because\r\nso few of their ships escaped the hawk-eyed British navy to operate in\r\nAmerican waters.\r\n\r\n=The Losses in American Commerce.=--This high-handed conduct on the part\r\nof European belligerents was very injurious to American trade. By their\r\nenterprise, American shippers had become the foremost carriers on the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. In a decade they had doubled the tonnage of American\r\nmerchant ships under the American flag, taking the place of the French\r\nmarine when Britain swept that from the seas, and supplying Britain with\r\nthe sinews of war for the contest with the Napoleonic empire. The\r\nAmerican shipping engaged in foreign trade embraced 363,110 tons in\r\n1791; 669,921 tons in 1800; and almost 1,000,000 tons in 1810. Such was\r\nthe enterprise attacked by the British and French decrees. American\r\nships bound for Great Britain were liable to be captured by French\r\nprivateers which, in spite of the disasters of the Nile and Trafalgar,\r\nranged the seas. American ships destined for the Continent, if they\r\nfailed to stop at British ports and pay tribute, were in great danger of\r\ncapture by the sleepless British navy and its swarm of auxiliaries.\r\nAmerican sea captains who, in fear of British vengeance, heeded the\r\nOrders in Council and paid the tax were almost certain to fall a prey to\r\nFrench vengeance, for the French were vigorous in executing the Milan\r\nDecree.\r\n\r\n=Jefferson's Policy.=--The President's dilemma was distressing. Both the\r\nbelligerents in Europe were guilty of depredations on American commerce.\r\nWar on both of them was out of the question. War on France was\r\nimpossible because she had no territory on this side of the water which\r\ncould be reached by American troops and her naval forces had been\r\nshattered at the battles of the Nile and Trafalgar. War on Great\r\nBritain, a power which Jefferson's followers feared and distrusted, was\r\npossible but not inviting. Jefferson shrank from it. A man of peace, he\r\ndisliked war's brazen clamor; a man of kindly spirit, he was startled at\r\nthe death and destruction which it brought in its train. So for the\r\neight years Jefferson steered an even course, suggesting measure after\r\nmeasure with a view to avoiding bloodshed. He sent, it is true,\r\nCommodore Preble in 1803 to punish Mediterranean pirates preying upon\r\nAmerican commerce; but a great war he evaded with passionate\r\nearnestness, trying in its place every other expedient to protect\r\nAmerican rights.\r\n\r\n=The Embargo and Non-intercourse Acts.=--In 1806, Congress passed and\r\nJefferson approved a non-importation act closing American ports to\r\ncertain products from British dominions--a measure intended as a club\r\nover the British government's head. This law, failing in its purpose,\r\nJefferson proposed and Congress adopted in December, 1807, the Embargo\r\nAct forbidding all vessels to leave American harbors for foreign ports.\r\nFrance and England were to be brought to terms by cutting off their\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\nThe result of the embargo was pathetic. England and France refused to\r\ngive up search and seizure. American ship owners who, lured by huge\r\nprofits, had formerly been willing to take the risk were now restrained\r\nby law to their home ports. Every section suffered. The South and West\r\nfound their markets for cotton, rice, tobacco, corn, and bacon\r\ncurtailed. Thus they learned by bitter experience the national\r\nsignificance of commerce. Ship masters, ship builders, longshoremen, and\r\nsailors were thrown out of employment while the prices of foreign goods\r\ndoubled. Those who obeyed the law were ruined; violators of the law\r\nsmuggled goods into Canada and Florida for shipment abroad.\r\n\r\nJefferson's friends accepted the medicine with a wry face as the only\r\nalternative to supine submission or open war. His opponents, without\r\noffering any solution of their own, denounced it as a contemptible plan\r\nthat brought neither relief nor honor. Beset by the clamor that arose on\r\nall sides, Congress, in the closing days of Jefferson's administration,\r\nrepealed the Embargo law and substituted a Non-intercourse act\r\nforbidding trade with England and France while permitting it with other\r\ncountries--a measure equally futile in staying the depredations on\r\nAmerican shipping.\r\n\r\n=Jefferson Retires in Favor of Madison.=--Jefferson, exhausted by\r\nendless wrangling and wounded, as Washington had been, by savage\r\ncriticism, welcomed March 4, 1809. His friends urged him to \"stay by the\r\nship\" and accept a third term. He declined, saying that election for\r\nlife might result from repeated reëlection. In following Washington's\r\ncourse and defending it on principle, he set an example to all his\r\nsuccessors, making the \"third term doctrine\" a part of American\r\nunwritten law.\r\n\r\nHis intimate friend, James Madison, to whom he turned over the burdens\r\nof his high office was, like himself, a man of peace. Madison had been a\r\nleader since the days of the Revolution, but in legislative halls and\r\ncouncil chambers, not on the field of battle. Small in stature,\r\nsensitive in feelings, studious in habits, he was no man for the rough\r\nand tumble of practical politics. He had taken a prominent and\r\ndistinguished part in the framing and the adoption of the Constitution.\r\nHe had served in the first Congress as a friend of Hamilton's measures.\r\nLater he attached himself to Jefferson's fortunes and served for eight\r\nyears as his first counselor, the Secretary of State. The principles of\r\nthe Constitution, which he had helped to make and interpret, he was now\r\nas President called upon to apply in one of the most perplexing moments\r\nin all American history. In keeping with his own traditions and\r\nfollowing in the footsteps of Jefferson, he vainly tried to solve the\r\nforeign problem by negotiation.\r\n\r\n=The Trend of Events.=--Whatever difficulties Madison had in making up\r\nhis mind on war and peace were settled by events beyond his own control.\r\nIn the spring of 1811, a British frigate held up an American ship near\r\nthe harbor of New York and impressed a seaman alleged to be an American\r\ncitizen. Burning with resentment, the captain of the _President_, an\r\nAmerican warship, acting under orders, poured several broadsides into\r\nthe _Little Belt_, a British sloop, suspected of being the guilty party.\r\nThe British also encouraged the Indian chief Tecumseh, who welded\r\ntogether the Indians of the Northwest under British protection and gave\r\nsigns of restlessness presaging a revolt. This sent a note of alarm\r\nalong the frontier that was not checked even when, in November,\r\nTecumseh's men were badly beaten at Tippecanoe by William Henry\r\nHarrison. The Indians stood in the way of the advancing frontier, and it\r\nseemed to the pioneers that, without support from the British in Canada,\r\nthe Red Men would soon be subdued.\r\n\r\n=Clay and Calhoun.=--While events were moving swiftly and rumors were\r\nflying thick and fast, the mastery of the government passed from the\r\nuncertain hands of Madison to a party of ardent young men in Congress,\r\ndubbed \"Young Republicans,\" under the leadership of two members destined\r\nto be mighty figures in American history: Henry Clay of Kentucky and\r\nJohn C. Calhoun of South Carolina. The former contended, in a flair of\r\nfolly, that \"the militia of Kentucky alone are competent to place\r\nMontreal and Upper Canada at your feet.\" The latter with a light heart\r\nspoke of conquering Canada in a four weeks' campaign. \"It must not be\r\ninferred,\" says Channing, \"that in advocating conquest, the Westerners\r\nwere actuated merely by desire for land; they welcomed war because they\r\nthought it would be the easiest way to abate Indian troubles. The\r\nsavages were supported by the fur-trading interests that centred at\r\nQuebec and London.... The Southerners on their part wished for Florida\r\nand they thought that the conquest of Canada would obviate some Northern\r\nopposition to this acquisition of slave territory.\" While Clay and\r\nCalhoun, spokesmen of the West and South, were not unmindful of what\r\nNapoleon had done to American commerce, they knew that their followers\r\nstill remembered with deep gratitude the aid of the French in the war\r\nfor independence and that the embers of the old hatred for George III,\r\nstill on the throne, could be readily blown into flame.\r\n\r\n=Madison Accepts War as Inevitable.=--The conduct of the British\r\nministers with whom Madison had to deal did little to encourage him in\r\nadhering to the policy of \"watchful waiting.\" One of them, a high Tory,\r\nbelieved that all Americans were alike \"except that a few are less\r\nknaves than others\" and his methods were colored by his belief. On the\r\nrecall of this minister the British government selected another no less\r\nhigh and mighty in his principles and opinions. So Madison became\r\nthoroughly discouraged about the outcome of pacific measures. When the\r\npressure from Congress upon him became too heavy, he gave way, signing\r\non June 18, 1812, the declaration of war on Great Britain. In\r\nproclaiming hostilities, the administration set forth the causes which\r\njustified the declaration; namely, the British had been encouraging the\r\nIndians to attack American citizens on the frontier; they had ruined\r\nAmerican trade by blockades; they had insulted the American flag by\r\nstopping and searching our ships; they had illegally seized American\r\nsailors and driven them into the British navy.\r\n\r\n=The Course of the War.=--The war lasted for nearly three years without\r\nbringing victory to either side. The surrender of Detroit by General\r\nHull to the British and the failure of the American invasion of Canada\r\nwere offset by Perry's victory on Lake Erie and a decisive blow\r\nadministered to British designs for an invasion of New York by way of\r\nPlattsburgh. The triumph of Jackson at New Orleans helped to atone for\r\nthe humiliation suffered in the burning of the Capitol by the British.\r\nThe stirring deeds of the _Constitution_, the _United States_, and the\r\n_Argus_ on the seas, the heroic death of Lawrence and the victories of a\r\nhundred privateers furnished consolation for those who suffered from the\r\niron blockade finally established by the British government when it came\r\nto appreciate the gravity of the situation. While men love the annals of\r\nthe sea, they will turn to the running battles, the narrow escapes, and\r\nthe reckless daring of American sailors in that naval contest with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nAll this was exciting but it was inconclusive. In fact, never was a\r\ngovernment less prepared than was that of the United States in 1812. It\r\nhad neither the disciplined troops, the ships of war, nor the supplies\r\nrequired by the magnitude of the military task. It was fortune that\r\nfavored the American cause. Great Britain, harassed, worn, and\r\nfinancially embarrassed by nearly twenty years of fighting in Europe,\r\nwas in no mood to gather her forces for a titanic effort in America even\r\nafter Napoleon was overthrown and sent into exile at Elba in the spring\r\nof 1814. War clouds still hung on the European horizon and the conflict\r\ntemporarily halted did again break out. To be rid of American anxieties\r\nand free for European eventualities, England was ready to settle with\r\nthe United States, especially as that could be done without conceding\r\nanything or surrendering any claims.\r\n\r\n=The Treaty of Peace.=--Both countries were in truth sick of a war that\r\noffered neither glory nor profit. Having indulged in the usual\r\ndiplomatic skirmishing, they sent representatives to Ghent to discuss\r\nterms of peace. After long negotiations an agreement was reached on\r\nChristmas eve, 1814, a few days before Jackson's victory at New Orleans.\r\nWhen the treaty reached America the people were surprised to find that\r\nit said nothing about the seizure of American sailors, the destruction\r\nof American trade, the searching of American ships, or the support of\r\nIndians on the frontier. Nevertheless, we are told, the people \"passed\r\nfrom gloom to glory\" when the news of peace arrived. The bells were\r\nrung; schools were closed; flags were displayed; and many a rousing\r\ntoast was drunk in tavern and private home. The rejoicing could\r\ncontinue. With Napoleon definitely beaten at Waterloo in June, 1815,\r\nGreat Britain had no need to impress sailors, search ships, and\r\nconfiscate American goods bound to the Continent. Once more the terrible\r\nsea power sank into the background and the ocean was again white with\r\nthe sails of merchantmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICANS NATIONALIZED\r\n\r\n=The Federalists Discredited.=--By a strange turn of fortune's wheel,\r\nthe party of Hamilton, Washington, Adams, the party of the grand nation,\r\nbecame the party of provincialism and nullification. New England,\r\nfinding its shipping interests crippled in the European conflict and\r\nthen penalized by embargoes, opposed the declaration of war on Great\r\nBritain, which meant the completion of the ruin already begun. In the\r\ncourse of the struggle, the Federalist leaders came perilously near to\r\ntreason in their efforts to hamper the government of the United States;\r\nand in their desperation they fell back upon the doctrine of\r\nnullification so recently condemned by them when it came from Kentucky.\r\nThe Senate of Massachusetts, while the war was in progress, resolved\r\nthat it was waged \"without justifiable cause,\" and refused to approve\r\nmilitary and naval projects not connected with \"the defense of our\r\nseacoast and soil.\" A Boston newspaper declared that the union was\r\nnothing but a treaty among sovereign states, that states could decide\r\nfor themselves the question of obeying federal law, and that armed\r\nresistance under the banner of a state would not be rebellion or\r\ntreason. The general assembly of Connecticut reminded the administration\r\nat Washington that \"the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign, and\r\nindependent state.\" Gouverneur Morris, a member of the convention which\r\nhad drafted the Constitution, suggested the holding of another\r\nconference to consider whether the Northern states should remain in the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old cartoon_\r\n\r\nNEW ENGLAND JUMPING INTO THE HANDS OF GEORGE III]\r\n\r\nIn October, 1814, a convention of delegates from Connecticut,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, and certain counties of New Hampshire and\r\nVermont was held at Hartford, on the call of Massachusetts. The counsels\r\nof the extremists were rejected but the convention solemnly went on\r\nrecord to the effect that acts of Congress in violation of the\r\nConstitution are void; that in cases of deliberate, dangerous, and\r\npalpable infractions the state is duty bound to interpose its authority\r\nfor the protection of its citizens; and that when emergencies occur the\r\nstates must be their own judges and execute their own decisions. Thus\r\nNew England answered the challenge of Calhoun and Clay. Fortunately its\r\nactions were not as rash as its words. The Hartford convention merely\r\nproposed certain amendments to the Constitution and adjourned. At the\r\nclose of the war, its proposals vanished harmlessly; but the men who\r\nmade them were hopelessly discredited.\r\n\r\n=The Second United States Bank.=--In driving the Federalists towards\r\nnullification and waging a national war themselves, the Republicans lost\r\nall their old taint of provincialism. Moreover, in turning to measures\r\nof reconstruction called forth by the war, they resorted to the national\r\ndevices of the Federalists. In 1816, they chartered for a period of\r\ntwenty years a second United States Bank--the institution which\r\nJefferson and Madison once had condemned as unsound and\r\nunconstitutional. The Constitution remained unchanged; times and\r\ncircumstances had changed. Calhoun dismissed the vexed question of\r\nconstitutionality with a scant reference to an ancient dispute, while\r\nMadison set aside his scruples and signed the bill.\r\n\r\n=The Protective Tariff of 1816.=--The Republicans supplemented the Bank\r\nby another Federalist measure--a high protective tariff. Clay viewed it\r\nas the beginning of his \"American system\" of protection. Calhoun\r\ndefended it on national principles. For this sudden reversal of policy\r\nthe young Republicans were taunted by some of their older party\r\ncolleagues with betraying the \"agricultural interest\" that Jefferson had\r\nfostered; but Calhoun refused to listen to their criticisms. \"When the\r\nseas are open,\" he said, \"the produce of the South may pour anywhere\r\ninto the markets of the Old World.... What are the effects of a war with\r\na maritime power--with England? Our commerce annihilated ... our\r\nagriculture cut off from its accustomed markets, the surplus of the\r\nfarmer perishes on his hands.... The recent war fell with peculiar\r\npressure on the growers of cotton and tobacco and the other great\r\nstaples of the country; and the same state of things will recur in the\r\nevent of another war unless prevented by the foresight of this body....\r\nWhen our manufactures are grown to a certain perfection, as they soon\r\nwill be under the fostering care of the government, we shall no longer\r\nexperience these evils.\" With the Republicans nationalized, the\r\nFederalist party, as an organization, disappeared after a crushing\r\ndefeat in the presidential campaign of 1816.\r\n\r\n=Monroe and the Florida Purchase.=--To the victor in that political\r\ncontest, James Monroe of Virginia, fell two tasks of national\r\nimportance, adding to the prestige of the whole country and deepening\r\nthe sense of patriotism that weaned men away from mere allegiance to\r\nstates. The first of these was the purchase of Florida from Spain. The\r\nacquisition of Louisiana let the Mississippi flow \"unvexed to the sea\";\r\nbut it left all the states east of the river cut off from the Gulf,\r\naffording them ground for discontent akin to that which had moved the\r\npioneers of Kentucky to action a generation earlier. The uncertainty as\r\nto the boundaries of Louisiana gave the United States a claim to West\r\nFlorida, setting on foot a movement for occupation. The Florida swamps\r\nwere a basis for Indian marauders who periodically swept into the\r\nfrontier settlements, and hiding places for runaway slaves. Thus the\r\nsanction of international law was given to punitive expeditions into\r\nalien territory.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer leaders stood waiting for the signal. It came. President\r\nMonroe, on the occasion of an Indian outbreak, ordered General Jackson\r\nto seize the offenders, in the Floridas, if necessary. The high-spirited\r\nwarrior, taking this as a hint that he was to occupy the coveted region,\r\nreplied that, if possession was the object of the invasion, he could\r\noccupy the Floridas within sixty days. Without waiting for an answer to\r\nthis letter, he launched his expedition, and in the spring of 1818 was\r\nmaster of the Spanish king's domain to the south.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for the king to do but to make the best of the\r\ninevitable by ceding the Floridas to the United States in return for\r\nfive million dollars to be paid to American citizens having claims\r\nagainst Spain. On Washington's birthday, 1819, the treaty was signed. It\r\nceded the Floridas to the United States and defined the boundary between\r\nMexico and the United States by drawing a line from the mouth of the\r\nSabine River in a northwesterly direction to the Pacific. On this\r\noccasion even Monroe, former opponent of the Constitution, forgot to\r\ninquire whether new territory could be constitutionally acquired and\r\nincorporated into the American union. The Republicans seemed far away\r\nfrom the days of \"strict construction.\" And Jefferson still lived!\r\n\r\n=The Monroe Doctrine.=--Even more effective in fashioning the national\r\nidea was Monroe's enunciation of the famous doctrine that bears his\r\nname. The occasion was another European crisis. During the Napoleonic\r\nupheaval and the years of dissolution that ensued, the Spanish colonies\r\nin America, following the example set by their English neighbors in\r\n1776, declared their independence. Unable to conquer them alone, the\r\nking of Spain turned for help to the friendly powers of Europe that\r\nlooked upon revolution and republics with undisguised horror.\r\n\r\n_The Holy Alliance._--He found them prepared to view his case with\r\nsympathy. Three of them, Austria, Prussia, and Russia, under the\r\nleadership of the Czar, Alexander I, in the autumn of 1815, had entered\r\ninto a Holy Alliance to sustain by reciprocal service the autocratic\r\nprinciple in government. Although the effusive, almost maudlin, language\r\nof the treaty did not express their purpose explicitly, the Alliance was\r\nlater regarded as a mere union of monarchs to prevent the rise and\r\ngrowth of popular government.\r\n\r\nThe American people thought their worst fears confirmed when, in 1822, a\r\nconference of delegates from Russia, Austria, Prussia, and France met at\r\nVerona to consider, among other things, revolutions that had just broken\r\nout in Spain and Italy. The spirit of the conference is reflected in the\r\nfirst article of the agreement reached by the delegates: \"The high\r\ncontracting powers, being convinced that the system of representative\r\ngovernment is equally incompatible with the monarchical principle and\r\nthe maxim of the sovereignty of the people with the divine right,\r\nmutually engage in the most solemn manner to use all their efforts to\r\nput an end to the system of representative government in whatever\r\ncountry it may exist in Europe and to prevent its being introduced in\r\nthose countries where it is not yet known.\" The Czar, who incidentally\r\ncoveted the west coast of North America, proposed to send an army to aid\r\nthe king of Spain in his troubles at home, thus preparing the way for\r\nintervention in Spanish America. It was material weakness not want of\r\nspirit, that prevented the grand union of monarchs from making open war\r\non popular government.\r\n\r\n_The Position of England._--Unfortunately, too, for the Holy Alliance,\r\nEngland refused to coöperate. English merchants had built up a large\r\ntrade with the independent Latin-American colonies and they protested\r\nagainst the restoration of Spanish sovereignty, which meant a renewal of\r\nSpain's former trade monopoly. Moreover, divine right doctrines had been\r\nlaid to rest in England and the representative principle thoroughly\r\nestablished. Already there were signs of the coming democratic flood\r\nwhich was soon to carry the first reform bill of 1832, extending the\r\nsuffrage, and sweep on to even greater achievements. British statesmen,\r\ntherefore, had to be cautious. In such circumstances, instead of\r\ncoöperating with the autocrats of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, they\r\nturned to the minister of the United States in London. The British prime\r\nminister, Canning, proposed that the two countries join in declaring\r\ntheir unwillingness to see the Spanish colonies transferred to any other\r\npower.\r\n\r\n_Jefferson's Advice._--The proposal was rejected; but President Monroe\r\ntook up the suggestion with Madison and Jefferson as well as with his\r\nSecretary of State, John Quincy Adams. They favored the plan. Jefferson\r\nsaid: \"One nation, most of all, could disturb us in this pursuit [of\r\nfreedom]; she now offers to lead, aid, and accompany us in it. By\r\nacceding to her proposition we detach her from the bands, bring her\r\nmighty weight into the scale of free government and emancipate a\r\ncontinent at one stroke.... With her on our side we need not fear the\r\nwhole world. With her then we should most sedulously cherish a cordial\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\n_Monroe's Statement of the Doctrine._--Acting on the advice of trusted\r\nfriends, President Monroe embodied in his message to Congress, on\r\nDecember 2, 1823, a statement of principles now famous throughout the\r\nworld as the Monroe Doctrine. To the autocrats of Europe he announced\r\nthat he would regard \"any attempt on their part to extend their system\r\nto any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace and safety.\"\r\nWhile he did not propose to interfere with existing colonies dependent\r\non European powers, he ranged himself squarely on the side of those that\r\nhad declared their independence. Any attempt by a European power to\r\noppress them or control their destiny in any manner he characterized as\r\n\"a manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the United States.\"\r\nReferring in another part of his message to a recent claim which the\r\nCzar had made to the Pacific coast, President Monroe warned the Old\r\nWorld that \"the American continents, by the free and independent\r\ncondition which they have assumed and maintained, are henceforth not to\r\nbe considered as subjects for future colonization by any European\r\npowers.\" The effect of this declaration was immediate and profound. Men\r\nwhose political horizon had been limited to a community or state were\r\nled to consider their nation as a great power among the sovereignties of\r\nthe earth, taking its part in shaping their international relations.\r\n\r\n=The Missouri Compromise.=--Respecting one other important measure of\r\nthis period, the Republicans also took a broad view of their obligations\r\nunder the Constitution; namely, the Missouri Compromise. It is true,\r\nthey insisted on the admission of Missouri as a slave state, balanced\r\nagainst the free state of Maine; but at the same time they assented to\r\nthe prohibition of slavery in the Louisiana territory north of the line\r\n36° 30'. During the debate on the subject an extreme view had been\r\npresented, to the effect that Congress had no constitutional warrant for\r\nabolishing slavery in the territories. The precedent of the Northwest\r\nOrdinance, ratified by Congress in 1789, seemed a conclusive answer from\r\npractice to this contention; but Monroe submitted the issue to his\r\ncabinet, which included Calhoun of South Carolina, Crawford of Georgia,\r\nand Wirt of Virginia, all presumably adherents to the Jeffersonian\r\nprinciple of strict construction. He received in reply a unanimous\r\nverdict to the effect that Congress did have the power to prohibit\r\nslavery in the territories governed by it. Acting on this advice he\r\napproved, on March 6, 1820, the bill establishing freedom north of the\r\ncompromise line. This generous interpretation of the powers of Congress\r\nstood for nearly forty years, until repudiated by the Supreme Court in\r\nthe Dred Scott case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL DECISIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL\r\n\r\n=John Marshall, the Nationalist.=--The Republicans in the lower ranges\r\nof state politics, who did not catch the grand national style of their\r\nleaders charged with responsibilities in the national field, were\r\nassisted in their education by a Federalist from the Old Dominion, John\r\nMarshall, who, as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates from 1801 to 1835, lost no occasion to exalt the Constitution\r\nabove the claims of the provinces. No differences of opinion as to his\r\npolitical views have ever led even his warmest opponents to deny his\r\nsuperb abilities or his sincere devotion to the national idea. All will\r\nlikewise agree that for talents, native and acquired, he was an ornament\r\nto the humble democracy that brought him forth. His whole career was\r\nAmerican. Born on the frontier of Virginia, reared in a log cabin,\r\ngranted only the barest rudiments of education, inured to hardship and\r\nrough life, he rose by masterly efforts to the highest judicial honor\r\nAmerica can bestow.\r\n\r\nOn him the bitter experience of the Revolution and of later days made a\r\nlasting impression. He was no \"summer patriot.\" He had been a soldier in\r\nthe Revolutionary army. He had suffered with Washington at Valley Forge.\r\nHe had seen his comrades in arms starving and freezing because the\r\nContinental Congress had neither the power nor the inclination to force\r\nthe states to do their full duty. To him the Articles of Confederation\r\nwere the symbol of futility. Into the struggle for the formation of the\r\nConstitution and its ratification in Virginia he had thrown himself with\r\nthe ardor of a soldier. Later, as a member of Congress, a representative\r\nto France, and Secretary of State, he had aided the Federalists in\r\nestablishing the new government. When at length they were driven from\r\npower in the executive and legislative branches of the government, he\r\nwas chosen for their last stronghold, the Supreme Court. By historic\r\nirony he administered the oath of office to his bitterest enemy, Thomas\r\nJefferson; and, long after the author of the Declaration of Independence\r\nhad retired to private life, the stern Chief Justice continued to\r\nannounce the old Federalist principles from the Supreme Bench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN MARSHALL]\r\n\r\n=Marbury _vs._ Madison--An Act of Congress Annulled.=--He had been in\r\nhis high office only two years when he laid down for the first time in\r\nthe name of the entire Court the doctrine that the judges have the power\r\nto declare an act of Congress null and void when in their opinion it\r\nviolates the Constitution. This power was not expressly conferred on the\r\nCourt. Though many able men held that the judicial branch of the\r\ngovernment enjoyed it, the principle was not positively established\r\nuntil 1803 when the case of Marbury _vs._ Madison was decided. In\r\nrendering the opinion of the Court, Marshall cited no precedents. He\r\nsought no foundations for his argument in ancient history. He rested it\r\non the general nature of the American system. The Constitution, ran his\r\nreasoning, is the supreme law of the land; it limits and binds all who\r\nact in the name of the United States; it limits the powers of Congress\r\nand defines the rights of citizens. If Congress can ignore its\r\nlimitations and trespass upon the rights of citizens, Marshall argued,\r\nthen the Constitution disappears and Congress is supreme. Since,\r\nhowever, the Constitution is supreme and superior to Congress, it is the\r\nduty of judges, under their oath of office, to sustain it against\r\nmeasures which violate it. Therefore, from the nature of the American\r\nconstitutional system the courts must declare null and void all acts\r\nwhich are not authorized. \"A law repugnant to the Constitution,\" he\r\nclosed, \"is void and the courts as well as other departments are bound\r\nby that instrument.\" From that day to this the practice of federal and\r\nstate courts in passing upon the constitutionality of laws has remained\r\nunshaken.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine was received by Jefferson and many of his followers with\r\nconsternation. If the idea was sound, he exclaimed, \"then indeed is our\r\nConstitution a complete _felo de se_ [legally, a suicide]. For,\r\nintending to establish three departments, coördinate and independent\r\nthat they might check and balance one another, it has given, according\r\nto this opinion, to one of them alone the right to prescribe rules for\r\nthe government of the others, and to that one, too, which is unelected\r\nby and independent of the nation.... The Constitution, on this\r\nhypothesis, is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the judiciary which\r\nthey may twist and shape into any form they please. It should be\r\nremembered, as an axiom of eternal truth in politics, that whatever\r\npower in any government is independent, is absolute also.... A judiciary\r\nindependent of a king or executive alone is a good thing; but\r\nindependence of the will of the nation is a solecism, at least in a\r\nrepublican government.\" But Marshall was mighty and his view prevailed,\r\nthough from time to time other men, clinging to Jefferson's opinion,\r\nlikewise opposed the exercise by the Courts of the high power of passing\r\nupon the constitutionality of acts of Congress.\r\n\r\n=Acts of State Legislatures Declared Unconstitutional.=--Had Marshall\r\nstopped with annulling an act of Congress, he would have heard less\r\ncriticism from Republican quarters; but, with the same firmness, he set\r\naside acts of state legislatures as well, whenever, in his opinion, they\r\nviolated the federal Constitution. In 1810, in the case of Fletcher\r\n_vs._ Peck, he annulled an act of the Georgia legislature, informing the\r\nstate that it was not sovereign, but \"a part of a large empire, ... a\r\nmember of the American union; and that union has a constitution ...\r\nwhich imposes limits to the legislatures of the several states.\" In the\r\ncase of McCulloch _vs._ Maryland, decided in 1819, he declared void an\r\nact of the Maryland legislature designed to paralyze the branches of the\r\nUnited States Bank established in that state. In the same year, in the\r\nstill more memorable Dartmouth College case, he annulled an act of the\r\nNew Hampshire legislature which infringed upon the charter received by\r\nthe college from King George long before. That charter, he declared, was\r\na contract between the state and the college, which the legislature\r\nunder the federal Constitution could not impair. Two years later he\r\nstirred the wrath of Virginia by summoning her to the bar of the Supreme\r\nCourt to answer in a case in which the validity of one of her laws was\r\ninvolved and then justified his action in a powerful opinion rendered in\r\nthe case of Cohens _vs._ Virginia.\r\n\r\nAll these decisions aroused the legislatures of the states. They passed\r\nsheaves of resolutions protesting and condemning; but Marshall never\r\nturned and never stayed. The Constitution of the United States, he\r\nfairly thundered at them, is the supreme law of the land; the Supreme\r\nCourt is the proper tribunal to pass finally upon the validity of the\r\nlaws of the states; and \"those sovereignties,\" far from possessing the\r\nright of review and nullification, are irrevocably bound by the\r\ndecisions of that Court. This was strong medicine for the authors of the\r\nKentucky and Virginia Resolutions and for the members of the Hartford\r\nconvention; but they had to take it.\r\n\r\n=The Doctrine of Implied Powers.=--While restraining Congress in the\r\nMarbury case and the state legislatures in a score of cases, Marshall\r\nalso laid the judicial foundation for a broad and liberal view of the\r\nConstitution as opposed to narrow and strict construction. In McCulloch\r\n_vs._ Maryland, he construed generously the words \"necessary and proper\"\r\nin such a way as to confer upon Congress a wide range of \"implied\r\npowers\" in addition to their express powers. That case involved, among\r\nother things, the question whether the act establishing the second\r\nUnited States Bank was authorized by the Constitution. Marshall answered\r\nin the affirmative. Congress, ran his reasoning, has large powers over\r\ntaxation and the currency; a bank is of appropriate use in the exercise\r\nof these enumerated powers; and therefore, though not absolutely\r\nnecessary, a bank is entirely proper and constitutional. \"With respect\r\nto the means by which the powers that the Constitution confers are to be\r\ncarried into execution,\" he said, Congress must be allowed the\r\ndiscretion which \"will enable that body to perform the high duties\r\nassigned to it, in the manner most beneficial to the people.\" In short,\r\nthe Constitution of the United States is not a strait jacket but a\r\nflexible instrument vesting in Congress the powers necessary to meet\r\nnational problems as they arise. In delivering this opinion Marshall\r\nused language almost identical with that employed by Lincoln when,\r\nstanding on the battle field of a war waged to preserve the nation, he\r\nsaid that \"a government of the people, by the people, for the people\r\nshall not perish from the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE UNION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nDuring the strenuous period between the establishment of American\r\nindependence and the advent of Jacksonian democracy the great American\r\nexperiment was under the direction of the men who had launched it. All\r\nthe Presidents in that period, except John Quincy Adams, had taken part\r\nin the Revolution. James Madison, the chief author of the Constitution,\r\nlived until 1836. This age, therefore, was the \"age of the fathers.\" It\r\nsaw the threatened ruin of the country under the Articles of\r\nConfederation, the formation of the Constitution, the rise of political\r\nparties, the growth of the West, the second war with England, and the\r\napparent triumph of the national spirit over sectionalism.\r\n\r\nThe new republic had hardly been started in 1783 before its troubles\r\nbegan. The government could not raise money to pay its debts or running\r\nexpenses; it could not protect American commerce and manufactures\r\nagainst European competition; it could not stop the continual issues of\r\npaper money by the states; it could not intervene to put down domestic\r\nuprisings that threatened the existence of the state governments.\r\nWithout money, without an army, without courts of law, the union under\r\nthe Articles of Confederation was drifting into dissolution. Patriots,\r\nwho had risked their lives for independence, began to talk of monarchy\r\nagain. Washington, Hamilton, and Madison insisted that a new\r\nconstitution alone could save America from disaster.\r\n\r\nBy dint of much labor the friends of a new form of government induced\r\nthe Congress to call a national convention to take into account the\r\nstate of America. In May, 1787, it assembled at Philadelphia and for\r\nmonths it debated and wrangled over plans for a constitution. The small\r\nstates clamored for equal rights in the union. The large states vowed\r\nthat they would never grant it. A spirit of conciliation, fair play, and\r\ncompromise saved the convention from breaking up. In addition, there\r\nwere jealousies between the planting states and the commercial states.\r\nHere, too, compromises had to be worked out. Some of the delegates\r\nfeared the growth of democracy and others cherished it. These factions\r\nalso had to be placated. At last a plan of government was drafted--the\r\nConstitution of the United States--and submitted to the states for\r\napproval. Only after a long and acrimonious debate did enough states\r\nratify the instrument to put it into effect. On April 30, 1789, George\r\nWashington was inaugurated first President.\r\n\r\nThe new government proceeded to fund the old debt of the nation, assume\r\nthe debts of the states, found a national bank, lay heavy taxes to pay\r\nthe bills, and enact laws protecting American industry and commerce.\r\nHamilton led the way, but he had not gone far before he encountered\r\nopposition. He found a formidable antagonist in Jefferson. In time two\r\npolitical parties appeared full armed upon the scene: the Federalists\r\nand the Republicans. For ten years they filled the country with\r\npolitical debate. In 1800 the Federalists were utterly vanquished by the\r\nRepublicans with Jefferson in the lead.\r\n\r\nBy their proclamations of faith the Republicans favored the states\r\nrather than the new national government, but in practice they added\r\nimmensely to the prestige and power of the nation. They purchased\r\nLouisiana from France, they waged a war for commercial independence\r\nagainst England, they created a second United States Bank, they enacted\r\nthe protective tariff of 1816, they declared that Congress had power to\r\nabolish slavery north of the Missouri Compromise line, and they spread\r\nthe shield of the Monroe Doctrine between the Western Hemisphere and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nStill America was a part of European civilization. Currents of opinion\r\nflowed to and fro across the Atlantic. Friends of popular government in\r\nEurope looked to America as the great exemplar of their ideals. Events\r\nin Europe reacted upon thought in the United States. The French\r\nRevolution exerted a profound influence on the course of political\r\ndebate. While it was in the stage of mere reform all Americans favored\r\nit. When the king was executed and a radical democracy set up, American\r\nopinion was divided. When France fell under the military dominion of\r\nNapoleon and preyed upon American commerce, the United States made ready\r\nfor war.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of England likewise affected American affairs. In 1793 war\r\nbroke out between England and France and raged with only a slight\r\nintermission until 1815. England and France both ravaged American\r\ncommerce, but England was the more serious offender because she had\r\ncommand of the seas. Though Jefferson and Madison strove for peace, the\r\ncountry was swept into war by the vehemence of the \"Young Republicans,\"\r\nheaded by Clay and Calhoun.\r\n\r\nWhen the armed conflict was closed, one in diplomacy opened. The\r\nautocratic powers of Europe threatened to intervene on behalf of Spain\r\nin her attempt to recover possession of her Latin-American colonies.\r\nTheir challenge to America brought forth the Monroe Doctrine. The powers\r\nof Europe were warned not to interfere with the independence or the\r\nrepublican policies of this hemisphere or to attempt any new\r\ncolonization in it. It seemed that nationalism was to have a peaceful\r\ntriumph over sectionalism.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nH. Adams, _History of the United States, 1800-1817_ (9 vols.).\r\n\r\nK.C.

THE WEST AND JACKSONIAN DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FARMERS BEYOND THE APPALACHIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nationalism of Hamilton was undemocratic. The democracy of Jefferson\r\nwas, in the beginning, provincial. The historic mission of uniting\r\nnationalism and democracy was in the course of time given to new leaders\r\nfrom a region beyond the mountains, peopled by men and women from all\r\nsections and free from those state traditions which ran back to the\r\nearly days of colonization. The voice of the democratic nationalism\r\nnourished in the West was heard when Clay of Kentucky advocated his\r\nAmerican system of protection for industries; when Jackson of Tennessee\r\ncondemned nullification in a ringing proclamation that has taken its\r\nplace among the great American state papers; and when Lincoln of\r\nIllinois, in a fateful hour, called upon a bewildered people to meet the\r\nsupreme test whether this was a nation destined to survive or to perish.\r\nAnd it will be remembered that Lincoln's party chose for its banner that\r\nearlier device--Republican--which Jefferson had made a sign of power.\r\nThe \"rail splitter\" from Illinois united the nationalism of Hamilton\r\nwith the democracy of Jefferson, and his appeal was clothed in the\r\nsimple language of the people, not in the sonorous rhetoric which\r\nWebster learned in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR WESTERN SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\n=The West and the American Revolution.=--The excessive attention devoted\r\nby historians to the military operations along the coast has obscured\r\nthe rôle played by the frontier in the American Revolution. The action\r\nof Great Britain in closing western land to easy settlement in 1763 was\r\nmore than an incident in precipitating the war for independence.\r\nAmericans on the frontier did not forget it; when Indians were employed\r\nby England to defend that land, zeal for the patriot cause set the\r\ninterior aflame. It was the members of the western vanguard, like Daniel\r\nBoone, John Sevier, and George Rogers Clark, who first understood the\r\nvalue of the far-away country under the guns of the English forts, where\r\nthe Red Men still wielded the tomahawk and the scalping knife. It was\r\nthey who gave the East no rest until their vision was seen by the\r\nleaders on the seaboard who directed the course of national policy. It\r\nwas one of their number, a seasoned Indian fighter, George Rogers Clark,\r\nwho with aid from Virginia seized Kaskaskia and Vincennes and secured\r\nthe whole Northwest to the union while the fate of Washington's army was\r\nstill hanging in the balance.\r\n\r\n=Western Problems at the End of the Revolution.=--The treaty of peace,\r\nsigned with Great Britain in 1783, brought the definite cession of the\r\ncoveted territory west to the Mississippi River, but it left unsolved\r\nmany problems. In the first place, tribes of resentful Indians in the\r\nOhio region, even though British support was withdrawn at last, had to\r\nbe reckoned with; and it was not until after the establishment of the\r\nfederal Constitution that a well-equipped army could be provided to\r\nguarantee peace on the border. In the second place, British garrisons\r\nstill occupied forts on Lake Erie pending the execution of the terms of\r\nthe treaty of 1783--terms which were not fulfilled until after the\r\nratification of the Jay treaty twelve years later. In the third place,\r\nVirginia, Connecticut, and Massachusetts had conflicting claims to the\r\nland in the Northwest based on old English charters and Indian treaties.\r\nIt was only after a bitter contest that the states reached an agreement\r\nto transfer their rights to the government of the United States,\r\nVirginia executing her deed of cession on March 1, 1784. In the fourth\r\nplace, titles to lands bought by individuals remained uncertain in the\r\nabsence of official maps and records. To meet this last situation,\r\nCongress instituted a systematic survey of the Ohio country, laying it\r\nout into townships, sections of 640 acres each, and quarter sections. In\r\nevery township one section of land was set aside for the support of\r\npublic schools.\r\n\r\n=The Northwest Ordinance.=--The final problem which had to be solved\r\nbefore settlement on a large scale could be begun was that of governing\r\nthe territory. Pioneers who looked with hungry eyes on the fertile\r\nvalley of the Ohio could hardly restrain their impatience. Soldiers of\r\nthe Revolution, who had been paid for their services in land warrants\r\nentitling them to make entries in the West, called for action.\r\n\r\nCongress answered by passing in 1787 the famous Northwest Ordinance\r\nproviding for temporary territorial government to be followed by the\r\ncreation of a popular assembly as soon as there were five thousand free\r\nmales in any district. Eventual admission to the union on an equal\r\nfooting with the original states was promised to the new territories.\r\nReligious freedom was guaranteed. The safeguards of trial by jury,\r\nregular judicial procedure, and _habeas corpus_ were established, in order\r\nthat the methods of civilized life might take the place of the\r\nrough-and-ready justice of lynch law. During the course of the debate on\r\nthe Ordinance, Congress added the sixth article forbidding slavery and\r\ninvoluntary servitude.\r\n\r\nThis Charter of the Northwest, so well planned by the Congress under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, was continued in force by the first Congress\r\nunder the Constitution in 1789. The following year its essential\r\nprovisions, except the ban on slavery, were applied to the territory\r\nsouth of the Ohio, ceded by North Carolina to the national government,\r\nand in 1798 to the Mississippi territory, once held by Georgia. Thus it\r\nwas settled for all time that \"the new colonies were not to be exploited\r\nfor the benefit of the parent states (any more than for the benefit of\r\nEngland) but were to be autonomous and coördinate commonwealths.\" This\r\noutcome, bitterly opposed by some Eastern leaders who feared the triumph\r\nof Western states over the seaboard, completed the legal steps necessary\r\nby way of preparation for the flood of settlers.\r\n\r\n=The Land Companies, Speculators, and Western Land Tenure.=--As in the\r\noriginal settlement of America, so in the opening of the West, great\r\ncompanies and single proprietors of large grants early figured. In 1787\r\nthe Ohio Land Company, a New England concern, acquired a million and a\r\nhalf acres on the Ohio and began operations by planting the town of\r\nMarietta. A professional land speculator, J.C. Symmes, secured a million\r\nacres lower down where the city of Cincinnati was founded. Other\r\nindividuals bought up soldiers' claims and so acquired enormous holdings\r\nfor speculative purposes. Indeed, there was such a rush to make fortunes\r\nquickly through the rise in land values that Washington was moved to cry\r\nout against the \"rage for speculating in and forestalling of land on the\r\nNorth West of the Ohio,\" protesting that \"scarce a valuable spot within\r\nany tolerable distance of it is left without a claimant.\" He therefore\r\nurged Congress to fix a reasonable price for the land, not \"too\r\nexorbitant and burdensome for real occupiers, but high enough to\r\ndiscourage monopolizers.\"\r\n\r\nCongress, however, was not prepared to use the public domain for the\r\nsole purpose of developing a body of small freeholders in the West. It\r\nstill looked upon the sale of public lands as an important source of\r\nrevenue with which to pay off the public debt; consequently it thought\r\nmore of instant income than of ultimate results. It placed no limit on\r\nthe amount which could be bought when it fixed the price at $2 an acre\r\nin 1796, and it encouraged the professional land operator by making the\r\nfirst installment only twenty cents an acre in addition to the small\r\nregistration and survey fee. On such terms a speculator with a few\r\nthousand dollars could get possession of an enormous plot of land. If he\r\nwas fortunate in disposing of it, he could meet the installments, which\r\nwere spread over a period of four years, and make a handsome profit for\r\nhimself. Even when the credit or installment feature was abolished in\r\n1821 and the price of the land lowered to a cash price of $1.75 an acre,\r\nthe opportunity for large speculative purchases continued to attract\r\ncapital to land ventures.\r\n\r\n=The Development of the Small Freehold.=--The cheapness of land and the\r\nscarcity of labor, nevertheless, made impossible the triumph of the huge\r\nestate with its semi-servile tenantry. For about $45 a man could get a\r\nfarm of 160 acres on the installment plan; another payment of $80 was\r\ndue in forty days; but a four-year term was allowed for the discharge of\r\nthe balance. With a capital of from two to three hundred dollars a\r\nfamily could embark on a land venture. If it had good crops, it could\r\nmeet the deferred payments. It was, however, a hard battle at best. Many\r\na man forfeited his land through failure to pay the final installment;\r\nyet in the end, in spite of all the handicaps, the small freehold of a\r\nfew hundred acres at most became the typical unit of Western\r\nagriculture, except in the planting states of the Gulf. Even the lands\r\nof the great companies were generally broken up and sold in small lots.\r\n\r\nThe tendency toward moderate holdings, so favored by Western conditions,\r\nwas also promoted by a clause in the Northwest Ordinance declaring that\r\nthe land of any person dying intestate--that is, without any will\r\ndisposing of it--should be divided equally among his descendants.\r\nHildreth says of this provision: \"It established the important\r\nrepublican principle, not then introduced into all the states, of the\r\nequal distribution of landed as well as personal property.\" All these\r\nforces combined made the wide dispersion of wealth, in the early days of\r\nthe nineteenth century, an American characteristic, in marked contrast\r\nwith the European system of family prestige and vast estates based on\r\nthe law of primogeniture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN MIGRATION AND NEW STATES\r\n\r\n=The People.=--With government established, federal arms victorious over\r\nthe Indians, and the lands surveyed for sale, the way was prepared for\r\nthe immigrants. They came with a rush. Young New Englanders, weary of\r\ntilling the stony soil of their native states, poured through New York\r\nand Pennsylvania, some settling on the northern bank of the Ohio but\r\nmost of them in the Lake region. Sons and daughters of German farmers in\r\nPennsylvania and many a redemptioner who had discharged his bond of\r\nservitude pressed out into Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, or beyond. From\r\nthe exhausted fields and the clay hills of the Southern states came\r\npioneers of English and Scotch-Irish descent, the latter in great\r\nnumbers. Indeed one historian of high authority has ventured to say that\r\n\"the rapid expansion of the United States from a coast strip to a\r\ncontinental area is largely a Scotch-Irish achievement.\" While native\r\nAmericans of mixed stocks led the way into the West, it was not long\r\nbefore immigrants direct from Europe, under the stimulus of company\r\nenterprise, began to filter into the new settlements in increasing\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe types of people were as various as the nations they represented.\r\nTimothy Flint, who published his entertaining _Recollections_ in 1826,\r\nfound the West a strange mixture of all sorts and conditions of people.\r\nSome of them, he relates, had been hunters in the upper world of the\r\nMississippi, above the falls of St. Anthony. Some had been still farther\r\nnorth, in Canada. Still others had wandered from the South--the Gulf of\r\nMexico, the Red River, and the Spanish country. French boatmen and\r\ntrappers, Spanish traders from the Southwest, Virginia planters with\r\ntheir droves of slaves mingled with English, German, and Scotch-Irish\r\nfarmers. Hunters, forest rangers, restless bordermen, and squatters,\r\nlike the foaming combers of an advancing tide, went first. Then followed\r\nthe farmers, masters of the ax and plow, with their wives who shared\r\nevery burden and hardship and introduced some of the features of\r\ncivilized life. The hunters and rangers passed on to new scenes; the\r\nhome makers built for all time.\r\n\r\n=The Number of Immigrants.=--There were no official stations on the\r\nfrontier to record the number of immigrants who entered the West during\r\nthe decades following the American Revolution. But travelers of the time\r\nrecord that every road was \"crowded\" with pioneers and their families,\r\ntheir wagons and cattle; and that they were seldom out of the sound of\r\nthe snapping whip of the teamster urging forward his horses or the crack\r\nof the hunter's rifle as he brought down his evening meal. \"During the\r\nlatter half of 1787,\" says Coman, \"more than nine hundred boats floated\r\ndown the Ohio carrying eighteen thousand men, women, and children, and\r\ntwelve thousand horses, sheep, and cattle, and six hundred and fifty\r\nwagons.\" Other lines of travel were also crowded and with the passing\r\nyears the flooding tide of home seekers rose higher and higher.\r\n\r\n=The Western Routes.=--Four main routes led into the country beyond the\r\nAppalachians. The Genesee road, beginning at Albany, ran almost due west\r\nto the present site of Buffalo on Lake Erie, through a level country. In\r\nthe dry season, wagons laden with goods could easily pass along it into\r\nnorthern Ohio. A second route, through Pittsburgh, was fed by three\r\neastern branches, one starting at Philadelphia, one at Baltimore, and\r\nanother at Alexandria. A third main route wound through the mountains\r\nfrom Alexandria to Boonesboro in Kentucky and then westward across the\r\nOhio to St. Louis. A fourth, the most famous of them all, passed through\r\nthe Cumberland Gap and by branches extended into the Cumberland valley\r\nand the Kentucky country.\r\n\r\nOf these four lines of travel, the Pittsburgh route offered the most\r\nadvantages. Pioneers, no matter from what section they came, when once\r\nthey were on the headwaters of the Ohio and in possession of a flatboat,\r\ncould find a quick and easy passage into all parts of the West and\r\nSouthwest. Whether they wanted to settle in Ohio, Kentucky, or western\r\nTennessee they could find their way down the drifting flood to their\r\ndestination or at least to some spot near it. Many people from the South\r\nas well as the Northern and Middle states chose this route; so it came\r\nabout that the sons and daughters of Virginia and the Carolinas mingled\r\nwith those of New York, Pennsylvania, and New England in the settlement\r\nof the Northwest territory.\r\n\r\n=The Methods of Travel into the West.=--Many stories giving exact\r\ndescriptions of methods of travel into the West in the early days have\r\nbeen preserved. The country was hardly opened before visitors from the\r\nOld World and from the Eastern states, impelled by curiosity, made their\r\nway to the very frontier of civilization and wrote books to inform or\r\namuse the public. One of them, Gilbert Imlay, an English traveler, has\r\ngiven us an account of the Pittsburgh route as he found it in 1791. \"If\r\na man ... \" he writes, \"has a family or goods of any sort to remove, his\r\nbest way, then, would be to purchase a waggon and team of horses to\r\ncarry his property to Redstone Old Fort or to Pittsburgh, according as\r\nhe may come from the Northern or Southern states. A good waggon will\r\ncost, at Philadelphia, about £10 ... and the horses about £12 each; they\r\nwould cost something more both at Baltimore and Alexandria. The waggon\r\nmay be covered with canvass, and if it is the choice of the people, they\r\nmay sleep in it of nights with the greatest safety. But if they dislike\r\nthat, there are inns of accommodation the whole distance on the\r\ndifferent roads.... The provisions I would purchase in the same manner\r\n[that is, from the farmers along the road]; and by having two or three\r\ncamp kettles and stopping every evening when the weather is fine upon\r\nthe brink of some rivulet and by kindling a fire they may soon dress\r\ntheir own food.... This manner of journeying is so far from being\r\ndisagreeable that in a fine season it is extremely pleasant.\" The\r\nimmigrant once at Pittsburgh or Wheeling could then buy a flatboat of a\r\nsize required for his goods and stock, and drift down the current to his\r\njourney's end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROADS AND TRAILS INTO THE WESTERN TERRITORY]\r\n\r\n=The Admission of Kentucky and Tennessee.=--When the eighteenth century\r\ndrew to a close, Kentucky had a population larger than Delaware, Rhode\r\nIsland, or New Hampshire. Tennessee claimed 60,000 inhabitants. In 1792\r\nKentucky took her place as a state beside her none too kindly parent,\r\nVirginia. The Eastern Federalists resented her intrusion; but they took\r\nsome consolation in the admission of Vermont because the balance of\r\nEastern power was still retained.\r\n\r\nAs if to assert their independence of old homes and conservative ideas\r\nthe makers of Kentucky's first constitution swept aside the landed\r\nqualification on the suffrage and gave the vote to all free white males.\r\nFour years later, Kentucky's neighbor to the south, Tennessee, followed\r\nthis step toward a wider democracy. After encountering fierce opposition\r\nfrom the Federalists, Tennessee was accepted as the sixteenth state.\r\n\r\n=Ohio.=--The door of the union had hardly opened for Tennessee when\r\nanother appeal was made to Congress, this time from the pioneers in\r\nOhio. The little posts founded at Marietta and Cincinnati had grown into\r\nflourishing centers of trade. The stream of immigrants, flowing down the\r\nriver, added daily to their numbers and the growing settlements all\r\naround poured produce into their markets to be exchanged for \"store\r\ngoods.\" After the Indians were disposed of in 1794 and the last British\r\nsoldier left the frontier forts under the terms of the Jay treaty of\r\n1795, tiny settlements of families appeared on Lake Erie in the \"Western\r\nReserve,\" a region that had been retained by Connecticut when she\r\nsurrendered her other rights in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the century, Ohio, claiming a population of more than\r\n50,000, grew discontented with its territorial status. Indeed, two years\r\nbefore the enactment of the Northwest Ordinance, squatters in that\r\nregion had been invited by one John Emerson to hold a convention after\r\nthe fashion of the men of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield in old\r\nConnecticut and draft a frame of government for themselves. This true\r\nson of New England declared that men \"have an undoubted right to pass\r\ninto every vacant country and there to form their constitution and that\r\nfrom the confederation of the whole United States Congress is not\r\nempowered to forbid them.\" This grand convention was never held because\r\nthe heavy hand of the government fell upon the leaders; but the spirit\r\nof John Emerson did not perish. In November, 1802, a convention chosen\r\nby voters, assembled under the authority of Congress at Chillicothe,\r\ndrew up a constitution. It went into force after a popular ratification.\r\nThe roll of the convention bore such names as Abbot, Baldwin, Cutler,\r\nHuntington, Putnam, and Sargent, and the list of counties from which\r\nthey came included Adams, Fairfield, Hamilton, Jefferson, Trumbull, and\r\nWashington, showing that the new America in the West was peopled and led\r\nby the old stock. In 1803 Ohio was admitted to the union.\r\n\r\n=Indiana and Illinois.=--As in the neighboring state, the frontier in\r\nIndiana advanced northward from the Ohio, mainly under the leadership,\r\nhowever, of settlers from the South--restless Kentuckians hoping for\r\nbetter luck in a newer country and pioneers from the far frontiers of\r\nVirginia and North Carolina. As soon as a tier of counties swinging\r\nupward like the horns of the moon against Ohio on the east and in the\r\nWabash Valley on the west was fairly settled, a clamor went up for\r\nstatehood. Under the authority of an act of Congress in 1816 the\r\nIndianians drafted a constitution and inaugurated their government at\r\nCorydon. \"The majority of the members of the convention,\" we are told by\r\na local historian, \"were frontier farmers who had a general idea of what\r\nthey wanted and had sense enough to let their more erudite colleagues\r\nput it into shape.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, the pioneers of Illinois, also settled upward from the\r\nOhio, like Indiana, elected their delegates to draft a constitution.\r\nLeadership in the convention, quite properly, was taken by a man born in\r\nNew York and reared in Tennessee; and the constitution as finally\r\ndrafted \"was in its principal provisions a copy of the then existing\r\nconstitutions of Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.... Many of the articles\r\nare exact copies in wording although differently arranged and\r\nnumbered.\"\r\n\r\n=Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.=--Across the Mississippi to the\r\nfar south, clearing and planting had gone on with much bustle and\r\nenterprise. The cotton and sugar lands of Louisiana, opened by French\r\nand Spanish settlers, were widened in every direction by planters with\r\ntheir armies of slaves from the older states. New Orleans, a good market\r\nand a center of culture not despised even by the pioneer, grew apace. In\r\n1810 the population of lower Louisiana was over 75,000. The time had\r\ncome, said the leaders of the people, to fulfill the promise made to\r\nFrance in the treaty of cession; namely, to grant to the inhabitants of\r\nthe territory statehood and the rights of American citizens. Federalists\r\nfrom New England still having a voice in Congress, if somewhat weaker,\r\nstill protested in tones of horror. \"I am compelled to declare it as my\r\ndeliberate opinion,\" pronounced Josiah Quincy in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, \"that if this bill [to admit Louisiana] passes, the\r\nbonds of this Union are virtually dissolved ... that as it will be the\r\nright of all, so it will be the duty of some [states] to prepare\r\ndefinitely for a separation; amicably if they can, violently if they\r\nmust.... It is a death blow to the Constitution. It may afterwards\r\nlinger; but lingering, its fate will, at no very distant period, be\r\nconsummated.\" Federalists from New York like those from New England had\r\ntheir doubts about the wisdom of admitting Western states; but the party\r\nof Jefferson and Madison, having the necessary majority, granted the\r\ncoveted statehood to Louisiana in 1812.\r\n\r\nWhen, a few years later, Mississippi and Alabama knocked at the doors of\r\nthe union, the Federalists had so little influence, on account of their\r\nconduct during the second war with England, that spokesmen from the\r\nSouthwest met a kindlier reception at Washington. Mississippi, in 1817,\r\nand Alabama, in 1819, took their places among the United States of\r\nAmerica. Both of them, while granting white manhood suffrage, gave their\r\nconstitutions the tone of the old East by providing landed\r\nqualifications for the governor and members of the legislature.\r\n\r\n=Missouri.=--Far to the north in the Louisiana purchase, a new\r\ncommonwealth was rising to power. It was peopled by immigrants who came\r\ndown the Ohio in fleets of boats or crossed the Mississippi from\r\nKentucky and Tennessee. Thrifty Germans from Pennsylvania, hardy farmers\r\nfrom Virginia ready to work with their own hands, freemen seeking\r\nfreemen's homes, planters with their slaves moving on from worn-out\r\nfields on the seaboard, came together in the widening settlements of the\r\nMissouri country. Peoples from the North and South flowed together,\r\nsmall farmers and big planters mingling in one community. When their\r\nnumbers had reached sixty thousand or more, they precipitated a contest\r\nover their admission to the union, \"ringing an alarm bell in the night,\"\r\nas Jefferson phrased it. The favorite expedient of compromise with\r\nslavery was brought forth in Congress once more. Maine consequently was\r\nbrought into the union without slavery and Missouri with slavery. At the\r\nsame time there was drawn westward through the rest of the Louisiana\r\nterritory a line separating servitude from slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE FRONTIER\r\n\r\n=Land Tenure and Liberty.=--Over an immense western area there developed\r\nan unbroken system of freehold farms. In the Gulf states and the lower\r\nMississippi Valley, it is true, the planter with his many slaves even\r\nled in the pioneer movement; but through large sections of Tennessee and\r\nKentucky, as well as upper Georgia and Alabama, and all throughout the\r\nNorthwest territory the small farmer reigned supreme. In this immense\r\ndominion there sprang up a civilization without caste or class--a body\r\nof people all having about the same amount of this world's goods and\r\nderiving their livelihood from one source: the labor of their own hands\r\non the soil. The Northwest territory alone almost equaled in area all\r\nthe original thirteen states combined, except Georgia, and its system of\r\nagricultural economy was unbroken by plantations and feudal estates. \"In\r\nthe subdivision of the soil and the great equality of condition,\" as\r\nWebster said on more than one occasion, \"lay the true basis, most\r\ncertainly, of popular government.\" There was the undoubted source of\r\nJacksonian democracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A LOG CABIN--LINCOLN'S BIRTHPLACE]\r\n\r\n=The Characteristics of the Western People.=--Travelers into the\r\nNorthwest during the early years of the nineteenth century were agreed\r\nthat the people of that region were almost uniformly marked by the\r\ncharacteristics common to an independent yeomanry. A close observer thus\r\nrecorded his impressions: \"A spirit of adventurous enterprise, a\r\nwillingness to go through any hardship to accomplish an object....\r\nIndependence of thought and action. They have felt the influence of\r\nthese principles from their childhood. Men who can endure anything; that\r\nhave lived almost without restraint, free as the mountain air or as the\r\ndeer and the buffalo of their forests, and who know they are Americans\r\nall.... An apparent roughness which some would deem rudeness of\r\nmanner.... Where there is perfect equality in a neighborhood of people\r\nwho know little about each other's previous history or ancestry but\r\nwhere each is lord of the soil he cultivates. Where a log cabin is all\r\nthat the best of families can expect to have for years and of course can\r\npossess few of the external decorations which have so much influence in\r\ncreating a diversity of rank in society. These circumstances have laid\r\nthe foundation for that equality of intercourse, simplicity of manners,\r\nwant of deference, want of reserve, great readiness to make\r\nacquaintances, freedom of speech, indisposition to brook real or\r\nimaginary insults which one witnesses among people of the West.\"\r\n\r\nThis equality, this independence, this rudeness so often described by\r\nthe traveler as marking a new country, were all accentuated by the\r\ncharacter of the settlers themselves. Traces of the fierce, unsociable,\r\neagle-eyed, hard-drinking hunter remained. The settlers who followed the\r\nhunter were, with some exceptions, soldiers of the Revolutionary army,\r\nfarmers of the \"middling order,\" and mechanics from the towns,--English,\r\nScotch-Irish, Germans,--poor in possessions and thrown upon the labor of\r\ntheir own hands for support. Sons and daughters from well-to-do Eastern\r\nhomes sometimes brought softer manners; but the equality of life and the\r\nleveling force of labor in forest and field soon made them one in spirit\r\nwith their struggling neighbors. Even the preachers and teachers, who\r\ncame when the cabins were raised in the clearings and rude churches and\r\nschoolhouses were built, preached sermons and taught lessons that\r\nsavored of the frontier, as any one may know who reads Peter\r\nCartwright's _A Muscular Christian_ or Eggleston's _The Hoosier\r\nSchoolmaster_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEST AND THE EAST MEET\r\n\r\n=The East Alarmed.=--A people so independent as the Westerners and so\r\nattached to local self-government gave the conservative East many a rude\r\nshock, setting gentlemen in powdered wigs and knee breeches agog with\r\nthe idea that terrible things might happen in the Mississippi Valley.\r\nNot without good grounds did Washington fear that \"a touch of a feather\r\nwould turn\" the Western settlers away from the seaboard to the\r\nSpaniards; and seriously did he urge the East not to neglect them, lest\r\nthey be \"drawn into the arms of, or be dependent upon foreigners.\"\r\nTaking advantage of the restless spirit in the Southwest, Aaron Burr,\r\nhaving disgraced himself by killing Alexander Hamilton in a duel, laid\r\nwild plans, if not to bring about a secession in that region, at least\r\nto build a state of some kind out of the Spanish dominions adjoining\r\nLouisiana. Frightened at such enterprises and fearing the dominance of\r\nthe West, the Federalists, with a few conspicuous exceptions, opposed\r\nequality between the sections. Had their narrow views prevailed, the\r\nWest, with its new democracy, would have been held in perpetual tutelage\r\nto the seaboard or perhaps been driven into independence as the thirteen\r\ncolonies had been not long before.\r\n\r\n=Eastern Friends of the West.=--Fortunately for the nation, there were\r\nmany Eastern leaders, particularly from the South, who understood the\r\nWest, approved its spirit, and sought to bring the two sections together\r\nby common bonds. Washington kept alive and keen the zeal for Western\r\nadvancement which he acquired in his youth as a surveyor. He never grew\r\ntired of urging upon his Eastern friends the importance of the lands\r\nbeyond the mountains. He pressed upon the governor of Virginia a project\r\nfor a wagon road connecting the seaboard with the Ohio country and was\r\nactive in a movement to improve the navigation of the Potomac. He\r\nadvocated strengthening the ties of commerce. \"Smooth the roads,\" he\r\nsaid, \"and make easy the way for them, and then see what an influx of\r\narticles will be poured upon us; how amazingly our exports will be\r\nincreased by them; and how amply we shall be compensated for any trouble\r\nand expense we may encounter to effect it.\" Jefferson, too, was\r\ninterested in every phase of Western development--the survey of lands,\r\nthe exploration of waterways, the opening of trade, and even the\r\ndiscovery of the bones of prehistoric animals. Robert Fulton, the\r\ninventor of the steamboat, was another man of vision who for many years\r\npressed upon his countrymen the necessity of uniting East and West by a\r\ncanal which would cement the union, raise the value of the public lands,\r\nand extend the principles of confederate and republican government.\r\n\r\n=The Difficulties of Early Transportation.=--Means of communication\r\nplayed an important part in the strategy of all those who sought to\r\nbring together the seaboard and the frontier. The produce of the\r\nWest--wheat, corn, bacon, hemp, cattle, and tobacco--was bulky and the\r\ncost of overland transportation was prohibitive. In the Eastern market,\r\n\"a cow and her calf were given for a bushel of salt, while a suit of\r\n'store clothes' cost as much as a farm.\" In such circumstances, the\r\ninhabitants of the Mississippi Valley were forced to ship their produce\r\nover a long route by way of New Orleans and to pay high freight rates\r\nfor everything that was brought across the mountains. Scows of from five\r\nto fifty tons were built at the towns along the rivers and piloted down\r\nthe stream to the Crescent City. In a few cases small ocean-going\r\nvessels were built to transport goods to the West Indies or to the\r\nEastern coast towns. Salt, iron, guns, powder, and the absolute\r\nessentials which the pioneers had to buy mainly in Eastern markets were\r\ncarried over narrow wagon trails that were almost impassable in the\r\nrainy season.\r\n\r\n=The National Road.=--To far-sighted men, like Albert Gallatin, \"the\r\nfather of internal improvements,\" the solution of this problem was the\r\nconstruction of roads and canals. Early in Jefferson's administration,\r\nCongress dedicated a part of the proceeds from the sale of lands to\r\nbuilding highways from the headwaters of the navigable waters emptying\r\ninto the Atlantic to the Ohio River and beyond into the Northwest\r\nterritory. In 1806, after many misgivings, it authorized a great\r\nnational highway binding the East and the West. The Cumberland Road, as\r\nit was called, began in northwestern Maryland, wound through southern\r\nPennsylvania, crossed the narrow neck of Virginia at Wheeling, and then\r\nshot almost straight across Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, into Missouri.\r\nBy 1817, stagecoaches were running between Washington and Wheeling; by\r\n1833 contractors had carried their work to Columbus, Ohio, and by 1852,\r\nto Vandalia, Illinois. Over this ballasted road mail and passenger\r\ncoaches could go at high speed, and heavy freight wagons proceed in\r\nsafety at a steady pace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUMBERLAND ROAD]\r\n\r\n=Canals and Steamboats.=--A second epoch in the economic union of the\r\nEast and West was reached with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825,\r\noffering an all-water route from New York City to the Great Lakes and\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. Pennsylvania, alarmed by the advantages\r\nconferred on New York by this enterprise, began her system of canals and\r\nportages from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, completing the last link in\r\n1834. In the South, the Chesapeake and Ohio Company, chartered in 1825,\r\nwas busy with a project to connect Georgetown and Cumberland when\r\nrailways broke in upon the undertaking before it was half finished.\r\nAbout the same time, Ohio built a canal across the state, affording\r\nwater communication between Lake Erie and the Ohio River through a rich\r\nwheat belt. Passengers could now travel by canal boat into the West with\r\ncomparative ease and comfort, if not at a rapid speed, and the bulkiest\r\nof freight could be easily handled. Moreover, the rate charged for\r\ncarrying goods was cut by the Erie Canal from $32 a ton per hundred\r\nmiles to $1. New Orleans was destined to lose her primacy in the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nThe diversion of traffic to Eastern markets was also stimulated by\r\nsteamboats which appeared on the Ohio about 1810, three years after\r\nFulton had made his famous trip on the Hudson. It took twenty men to\r\nsail and row a five-ton scow up the river at a speed of from ten to\r\ntwenty miles a day. In 1825, Timothy Flint traveled a hundred miles a\r\nday on the new steamer _Grecian_ \"against the whole weight of the\r\nMississippi current.\" Three years later the round trip from Louisville\r\nto New Orleans was cut to eight days. Heavy produce that once had to\r\nfloat down to New Orleans could be carried upstream and sent to the East\r\nby way of the canal systems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nAN EARLY MISSISSIPPI STEAMBOAT]\r\n\r\nThus the far country was brought near. The timid no longer hesitated at\r\nthe thought of the perilous journey. All routes were crowded with\r\nWestern immigrants. The forests fell before the ax like grain before the\r\nsickle. Clearings scattered through the woods spread out into a great\r\nmosaic of farms stretching from the Southern Appalachians to Lake\r\nMichigan. The national census of 1830 gave 937,000 inhabitants to Ohio;\r\n343,000 to Indiana; 157,000 to Illinois; 687,000 to Kentucky; and\r\n681,000 to Tennessee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF POPULATION, 1830]\r\n\r\nWith the increase in population and the growth of agriculture came\r\npolitical influence. People who had once petitioned Congress now sent\r\ntheir own representatives. Men who had hitherto accepted without\r\nprotests Presidents from the seaboard expressed a new spirit of dissent\r\nin 1824 by giving only three electoral votes for John Quincy Adams; and\r\nfour years later they sent a son of the soil from Tennessee, Andrew\r\nJackson, to take Washington's chair as chief executive of the\r\nnation--the first of a long line of Presidents from the Mississippi\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nW.G.

By the admission of these [new] states that balance has been\r\nmaterially affected and unless the practice be modified must ultimately\r\nbe destroyed. The Southern states will first avail themselves of their\r\nnew confederates to govern the East, and finally the Western states,\r\nmultiplied in number, and augmented in population, will control the\r\ninterests of the whole.\" Strangely enough the fulfillment of this\r\nprophecy was being prepared even in Federalist strongholds by the rise\r\nof a new urban democracy that was to make common cause with the farmers\r\nbeyond the mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT IN THE EAST\r\n\r\n=The Aristocratic Features of the Old Order.=--The Revolutionary\r\nfathers, in setting up their first state constitutions, although they\r\noften spoke of government as founded on the consent of the governed, did\r\nnot think that consistency required giving the vote to all adult males.\r\nOn the contrary they looked upon property owners as the only safe\r\n\"depositary\" of political power. They went back to the colonial\r\ntradition that related taxation and representation. This, they argued,\r\nwas not only just but a safeguard against the \"excesses of democracy.\"\r\n\r\nIn carrying their theory into execution they placed taxpaying or\r\nproperty qualifications on the right to vote. Broadly speaking, these\r\nlimitations fell into three classes. Three states, Pennsylvania (1776),\r\nNew Hampshire (1784), and Georgia (1798), gave the ballot to all who\r\npaid taxes, without reference to the value of their property. Three,\r\nVirginia, Delaware, and Rhode Island, clung firmly to the ancient\r\nprinciples that only freeholders could be intrusted with electoral\r\nrights. Still other states, while closely restricting the suffrage,\r\naccepted the ownership of other things as well as land in fulfillment of\r\nthe requirements. In Massachusetts, for instance, the vote was granted\r\nto all men who held land yielding an annual income of three pounds or\r\npossessed other property worth sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe electors thus enfranchised, numerous as they were, owing to the wide\r\ndistribution of land, often suffered from a very onerous disability. In\r\nmany states they were able to vote only for persons of wealth because\r\nheavy property qualifications were imposed on public officers. In New\r\nHampshire, the governor had to be worth five hundred pounds, one-half in\r\nland; in Massachusetts, one thousand pounds, all freehold; in Maryland,\r\nfive thousand pounds, one thousand of which was freehold; in North\r\nCarolina, one thousand pounds freehold; and in South Carolina, ten\r\nthousand pounds freehold. A state senator in Massachusetts had to be the\r\nowner of a freehold worth three hundred pounds or personal property\r\nworth six hundred pounds; in New Jersey, one thousand pounds' worth of\r\nproperty; in North Carolina, three hundred acres of land; in South\r\nCarolina, two thousand pounds freehold. For members of the lower house\r\nof the legislature lower qualifications were required.\r\n\r\nIn most of the states the suffrage or office holding or both were\r\nfurther restricted by religious provisions. No single sect was powerful\r\nenough to dominate after the Revolution, but, for the most part,\r\nCatholics and Jews were either disfranchised or excluded from office.\r\nNorth Carolina and Georgia denied the ballot to any one who was not a\r\nProtestant. Delaware withheld it from all who did not believe in the\r\nTrinity and the inspiration of the Scriptures. Massachusetts and\r\nMaryland limited it to Christians. Virginia and New York, advanced for\r\ntheir day, made no discrimination in government on account of religious\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n=The Defense of the Old Order.=--It must not be supposed that property\r\nqualifications were thoughtlessly imposed at the outset or considered of\r\nlittle consequence in practice. In the beginning they were viewed as\r\nfundamental. As towns grew in size and the number of landless citizens\r\nincreased, the restrictions were defended with even more vigor. In\r\nMassachusetts, the great Webster upheld the rights of property in\r\ngovernment, saying: \"It is entirely just that property should have its\r\ndue weight and consideration in political arrangements.... The\r\ndisastrous revolutions which the world has witnessed, those political\r\nthunderstorms and earthquakes which have shaken the pillars of society\r\nto their deepest foundations, have been revolutions against property.\"\r\nIn Pennsylvania, a leader in local affairs cried out against a plan to\r\nremove the taxpaying limitation on the suffrage: \"What does the delegate\r\npropose? To place the vicious vagrant, the wandering Arabs, the Tartar\r\nhordes of our large cities on the level with the virtuous and good man?\"\r\nIn Virginia, Jefferson himself had first believed in property\r\nqualifications and had feared with genuine alarm the \"mobs of the great\r\ncities.\" It was near the end of the eighteenth century before he\r\naccepted the idea of manhood suffrage. Even then he was unable to\r\nconvince the constitution-makers of his own state. \"It is not an idle\r\nchimera of the brain,\" urged one of them, \"that the possession of land\r\nfurnishes the strongest evidence of permanent, common interest with, and\r\nattachment to, the community.... It is upon this foundation I wish to\r\nplace the right of suffrage. This is the best general standard which can\r\nbe resorted to for the purpose of determining whether the persons to be\r\ninvested with the right of suffrage are such persons as could be,\r\nconsistently with the safety and well-being of the community, intrusted\r\nwith the exercise of that right.\"\r\n\r\n=Attacks on the Restricted Suffrage.=--The changing circumstances of\r\nAmerican life, however, soon challenged the rule of those with property.\r\nProminent among the new forces were the rising mercantile and business\r\ninterests. Where the freehold qualification was applied, business men\r\nwho did not own land were deprived of the vote and excluded from office.\r\nIn New York, for example, the most illiterate farmer who had one hundred\r\npounds' worth of land could vote for state senator and governor, while\r\nthe landless banker or merchant could not. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, to find business men taking the lead in breaking down\r\nfreehold limitations on the suffrage. The professional classes also were\r\ninterested in removing the barriers which excluded many of them from\r\npublic affairs. It was a schoolmaster, Thomas Dorr, who led the popular\r\nuprising in Rhode Island which brought the exclusive rule by freeholders\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the business and professional classes, the mechanics of\r\nthe towns showed a growing hostility to a system of government that\r\ngenerally barred them from voting or holding office. Though not\r\nnumerous, they had early begun to exercise an influence on the course of\r\npublic affairs. They had led the riots against the Stamp Act, overturned\r\nKing George's statue, and \"crammed stamps down the throats of\r\ncollectors.\" When the state constitutions were framed they took a lively\r\ninterest, particularly in New York City and Philadelphia. In June, 1776,\r\nthe \"mechanicks in union\" in New York protested against putting the new\r\nstate constitution into effect without their approval, declaring that\r\nthe right to vote on the acceptance or rejection of a fundamental law\r\n\"is the birthright of every man to whatever state he may belong.\" Though\r\ntheir petition was rejected, their spirit remained. When, a few years\r\nlater, the federal Constitution was being framed, the mechanics watched\r\nthe process with deep concern; they knew that one of its main objects\r\nwas to promote trade and commerce, affecting directly their daily bread.\r\nDuring the struggle over ratification, they passed resolutions approving\r\nits provisions and they often joined in parades organized to stir up\r\nsentiment for the Constitution, even though they could not vote for\r\nmembers of the state conventions and so express their will directly.\r\nAfter the organization of trade unions they collided with the courts of\r\nlaw and thus became interested in the election of judges and lawmakers.\r\n\r\nThose who attacked the old system of class rule found a strong moral\r\nsupport in the Declaration of Independence. Was it not said that all men\r\nare created equal? Whoever runs may read. Was it not declared that\r\ngovernments derive their just power from the consent of the governed?\r\nThat doctrine was applied with effect to George III and seemed\r\nappropriate for use against the privileged classes of Massachusetts or\r\nVirginia. \"How do the principles thus proclaimed,\" asked the\r\nnon-freeholders of Richmond, in petitioning for the ballot, \"accord with\r\nthe existing regulation of the suffrage? A regulation which, instead of\r\nthe equality nature ordains, creates an odious distinction between\r\nmembers of the same community ... and vests in a favored class, not in\r\nconsideration of their public services but of their private possessions,\r\nthe highest of all privileges.\"\r\n\r\n=Abolition of Property Qualifications.=--By many minor victories rather\r\nthan by any spectacular triumphs did the advocates of manhood suffrage\r\ncarry the day. Slight gains were made even during the Revolution or\r\nshortly afterward. In Pennsylvania, the mechanics, by taking an active\r\npart in the contest over the Constitution of 1776, were able to force\r\nthe qualification down to the payment of a small tax. Vermont came into\r\nthe union in 1792 without any property restrictions. In the same year\r\nDelaware gave the vote to all men who paid taxes. Maryland, reckoned one\r\nof the most conservative of states, embarked on the experiment of\r\nmanhood suffrage in 1809; and nine years later, Connecticut, equally\r\nconservative, decided that all taxpayers were worthy of the ballot.\r\n\r\nFive states, Massachusetts, New York, Virginia, Rhode Island, and North\r\nCarolina, remained obdurate while these changes were going on around\r\nthem; finally they had to yield themselves. The last struggle in\r\nMassachusetts took place in the constitutional convention of 1820. There\r\nWebster, in the prime of his manhood, and John Adams, in the closing\r\nyears of his old age, alike protested against such radical innovations\r\nas manhood suffrage. Their protests were futile. The property test was\r\nabolished and a small tax-paying qualification was substituted. New York\r\nsurrendered the next year and, after trying some minor restrictions for\r\nfive years, went completely over to white manhood suffrage in 1826.\r\nRhode Island clung to her freehold qualification through thirty years of\r\nagitation. Then Dorr's Rebellion, almost culminating in bloodshed,\r\nbrought about a reform in 1843 which introduced a slight tax-paying\r\nqualification as an alternative to the freehold. Virginia and North\r\nCarolina were still unconvinced. The former refused to abandon ownership\r\nof land as the test for political rights until 1850 and the latter until\r\n1856. Although religious discriminations and property qualifications for\r\noffice holders were sometimes retained after the establishment of\r\nmanhood suffrage, they were usually abolished along with the monopoly of\r\ngovernment enjoyed by property owners and taxpayers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS DORR AROUSING HIS FOLLOWERS]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century, the white\r\nmale industrial workers and the mechanics of the Northern cities, at\r\nleast, could lay aside the petition for the ballot and enjoy with the\r\nfree farmer a voice in the government of their common country.\r\n\"Universal democracy,\" sighed Carlyle, who was widely read in the United\r\nStates, \"whatever we may think of it has declared itself the inevitable\r\nfact of the days in which we live; and he who has any chance to instruct\r\nor lead in these days must begin by admitting that ... Where no\r\ngovernment is wanted, save that of the parish constable, as in America\r\nwith its boundless soil, every man being able to find work and\r\nrecompense for himself, democracy may subsist; not elsewhere.\" Amid the\r\ngrave misgivings of the first generation of statesmen, America was\r\ncommitted to the great adventure, in the populous towns of the East as\r\nwell as in the forests and fields of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW DEMOCRACY ENTERS THE ARENA\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the new order soon had a pronounced effect on the\r\nmachinery of government and the practice of politics. The enfranchised\r\nelectors were not long in demanding for themselves a larger share in\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\n=The Spoils System and Rotation in Office.=--First of all they wanted\r\noffice for themselves, regardless of their fitness. They therefore\r\nextended the system of rewarding party workers with government\r\npositions--a system early established in several states, notably New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania. Closely connected with it was the practice of\r\nfixing short terms for officers and making frequent changes in\r\npersonnel. \"Long continuance in office,\" explained a champion of this\r\nidea in Pennsylvania in 1837, \"unfits a man for the discharge of its\r\nduties, by rendering him arbitrary and aristocratic, and tends to beget,\r\nfirst life office, and then hereditary office, which leads to the\r\ndestruction of free government.\" The solution offered was the historic\r\ndoctrine of \"rotation in office.\" At the same time the principle of\r\npopular election was extended to an increasing number of officials who\r\nhad once been appointed either by the governor or the legislature. Even\r\ngeologists, veterinarians, surveyors, and other technical officers were\r\ndeclared elective on the theory that their appointment \"smacked of\r\nmonarchy.\"\r\n\r\n=Popular Election of Presidential Electors.=--In a short time the spirit\r\nof democracy, while playing havoc with the old order in state\r\ngovernment, made its way upward into the federal system. The framers of\r\nthe Constitution, bewildered by many proposals and unable to agree on\r\nany single plan, had committed the choice of presidential electors to\r\nthe discretion of the state legislatures. The legislatures, in turn,\r\ngreedy of power, early adopted the practice of choosing the electors\r\nthemselves; but they did not enjoy it long undisturbed. Democracy,\r\nthundering at their doors, demanded that they surrender the privilege to\r\nthe people. Reluctantly they yielded, sometimes granting popular\r\nelection and then withdrawing it. The drift was inevitable, and the\r\nclimax came with the advent of Jacksonian democracy. In 1824, Vermont,\r\nNew York, Delaware, South Carolina, Georgia, and Louisiana, though some\r\nhad experimented with popular election, still left the choice of\r\nelectors with the legislature. Eight years later South Carolina alone\r\nheld to the old practice. Popular election had become the final word.\r\nThe fanciful idea of an electoral college of \"good and wise men,\"\r\nselected without passion or partisanship by state legislatures acting as\r\ndeliberative bodies, was exploded for all time; the election of the\r\nnation's chief magistrate was committed to the tempestuous methods of\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\n=The Nominating Convention.=--As the suffrage was widened and the\r\npopular choice of presidential electors extended, there arose a violent\r\nprotest against the methods used by the political parties in nominating\r\ncandidates. After the retirement of Washington, both the Republicans and\r\nthe Federalists found it necessary to agree upon their favorites before\r\nthe election, and they adopted a colonial device--the pre-election\r\ncaucus. The Federalist members of Congress held a conference and\r\nselected their candidate, and the Republicans followed the example. In\r\na short time the practice of nominating by a \"congressional caucus\"\r\nbecame a recognized institution. The election still remained with the\r\npeople; but the power of picking candidates for their approval passed\r\ninto the hands of a small body of Senators and Representatives.\r\n\r\nA reaction against this was unavoidable. To friends of \"the plain\r\npeople,\" like Andrew Jackson, it was intolerable, all the more so\r\nbecause the caucus never favored him with the nomination. More\r\nconservative men also found grave objections to it. They pointed out\r\nthat, whereas the Constitution intended the President to be an\r\nindependent officer, he had now fallen under the control of a caucus of\r\ncongressmen. The supremacy of the legislative branch had been obtained\r\nby an extra-legal political device. To such objections were added\r\npractical considerations. In 1824, when personal rivalry had taken the\r\nplace of party conflicts, the congressional caucus selected as the\r\ncandidate, William H. Crawford, of Georgia, a man of distinction but no\r\ngreat popularity, passing by such an obvious hero as General Jackson.\r\nThe followers of the General were enraged and demanded nothing short of\r\nthe death of \"King Caucus.\" Their clamor was effective. Under their\r\nattacks, the caucus came to an ignominious end.\r\n\r\nIn place of it there arose in 1831 a new device, the national nominating\r\nconvention, composed of delegates elected by party voters for the sole\r\npurpose of nominating candidates. Senators and Representatives were\r\nstill prominent in the party councils, but they were swamped by hundreds\r\nof delegates \"fresh from the people,\" as Jackson was wont to say. In\r\nfact, each convention was made up mainly of office holders and office\r\nseekers, and the new institution was soon denounced as vigorously as\r\nKing Caucus had been, particularly by statesmen who failed to obtain a\r\nnomination. Still it grew in strength and by 1840 was firmly\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n=The End of the Old Generation.=--In the election of 1824, the\r\nrepresentatives of the \"aristocracy\" made their last successful stand.\r\nUntil then the leadership by men of \"wealth and talents\" had been\r\nundisputed. There had been five Presidents--Washington, John Adams,\r\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe--all Eastern men brought up in prosperous\r\nfamilies with the advantages of culture which come from leisure and the\r\npossession of life's refinements. None of them had ever been compelled\r\nto work with his hands for a livelihood. Four of them had been\r\nslaveholders. Jefferson was a philosopher, learned in natural science, a\r\nmaster of foreign languages, a gentleman of dignity and grace of manner,\r\nnotwithstanding his studied simplicity. Madison, it was said, was armed\r\n\"with all the culture of his century.\" Monroe was a graduate of William\r\nand Mary, a gentleman of the old school. Jefferson and his three\r\nsuccessors called themselves Republicans and professed a genuine faith\r\nin the people but they were not \"of the people\" themselves; they were\r\nnot sons of the soil or the workshop. They were all men of \"the grand\r\nold order of society\" who gave finish and style even to popular\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMonroe was the last of the Presidents belonging to the heroic epoch of\r\nthe Revolution. He had served in the war for independence, in the\r\nCongress under the Articles of Confederation, and in official capacity\r\nafter the adoption of the Constitution. In short, he was of the age that\r\nhad wrought American independence and set the government afloat. With\r\nhis passing, leadership went to a new generation; but his successor,\r\nJohn Quincy Adams, formed a bridge between the old and the new in that\r\nhe combined a high degree of culture with democratic sympathies.\r\nWashington had died in 1799, preceded but a few months by Patrick Henry\r\nand followed in four years by Samuel Adams. Hamilton had been killed in\r\na duel with Burr in 1804. Thomas Jefferson and John Adams were yet alive\r\nin 1824 but they were soon to pass from the scene, reconciled at last,\r\nfull of years and honors. Madison was in dignified retirement, destined\r\nto live long enough to protest against the doctrine of nullification\r\nproclaimed by South Carolina before death carried him away at the ripe\r\nold age of eighty-five.\r\n\r\n=The Election of John Quincy Adams (1824).=--The campaign of 1824 marked\r\nthe end of the \"era of good feeling\" inaugurated by the collapse of the\r\nFederalist party after the election of 1816. There were four leading\r\ncandidates, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, and W.H.\r\nCrawford. The result of the election was a division of the electoral\r\nvotes into four parts and no one received a majority. Under the\r\nConstitution, therefore, the selection of President passed to the House\r\nof Representatives. Clay, who stood at the bottom of the poll, threw his\r\nweight to Adams and assured his triumph, much to the chagrin of\r\nJackson's friends. They thought, with a certain justification, that\r\ninasmuch as the hero of New Orleans had received the largest electoral\r\nvote, the House was morally bound to accept the popular judgment and\r\nmake him President. Jackson shook hands cordially with Adams on the day\r\nof the inauguration, but never forgave him for being elected.\r\n\r\nWhile Adams called himself a Republican in politics and often spoke of\r\n\"the rule of the people,\" he was regarded by Jackson's followers as \"an\r\naristocrat.\" He was not a son of the soil. Neither was he acquainted at\r\nfirst hand with the labor of farmers and mechanics. He had been educated\r\nat Harvard and in Europe. Like his illustrious father, John Adams, he\r\nwas a stern and reserved man, little given to seeking popularity.\r\nMoreover, he was from the East and the frontiersmen of the West regarded\r\nhim as a man \"born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\" Jackson's\r\nsupporters especially disliked him because they thought their hero\r\nentitled to the presidency. Their anger was deepened when Adams\r\nappointed Clay to the office of Secretary of State; and they set up a\r\ncry that there had been a \"deal\" by which Clay had helped to elect Adams\r\nto get office for himself.\r\n\r\nThough Adams conducted his administration with great dignity and in a\r\nfine spirit of public service, he was unable to overcome the opposition\r\nwhich he encountered on his election to office or to win popularity in\r\nthe West and South. On the contrary, by advocating government assistance\r\nin building roads and canals and public grants in aid of education,\r\narts, and sciences, he ran counter to the current which had set in\r\nagainst appropriations of federal funds for internal improvements. By\r\nsigning the Tariff Bill of 1828, soon known as the \"Tariff of\r\nAbominations,\" he made new enemies without adding to his friends in New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, and Ohio where he sorely needed them. Handicapped by\r\nthe false charge that he had been a party to a \"corrupt bargain\" with\r\nClay to secure his first election; attacked for his advocacy of a high\r\nprotective tariff; charged with favoring an \"aristocracy of\r\noffice-holders\" in Washington on account of his refusal to discharge\r\ngovernment clerks by the wholesale, Adams was retired from the White\r\nHouse after he had served four years.\r\n\r\n=The Triumph of Jackson in 1828.=--Probably no candidate for the\r\npresidency ever had such passionate popular support as Andrew Jackson\r\nhad in 1828. He was truly a man of the people. Born of poor parents in\r\nthe upland region of South Carolina, schooled in poverty and adversity,\r\nwithout the advantages of education or the refinements of cultivated\r\nleisure, he seemed the embodiment of the spirit of the new American\r\ndemocracy. Early in his youth he had gone into the frontier of Tennessee\r\nwhere he soon won a name as a fearless and intrepid Indian fighter. On\r\nthe march and in camp, he endeared himself to his men by sharing their\r\nhardships, sleeping on the ground with them, and eating parched corn\r\nwhen nothing better could be found for the privates. From local\r\nprominence he sprang into national fame by his exploit at the battle of\r\nNew Orleans. His reputation as a military hero was enhanced by the\r\nfeeling that he had been a martyr to political treachery in 1824. The\r\nfarmers of the West and South claimed him as their own. The mechanics of\r\nthe Eastern cities, newly enfranchised, also looked upon him as their\r\nfriend. Though his views on the tariff, internal improvements, and other\r\nissues before the country were either vague or unknown, he was readily\r\nelected President.\r\n\r\nThe returns of the electoral vote in 1828 revealed the sources of\r\nJackson's power. In New England, he received but one ballot, from\r\nMaine; he had a majority of the electors in New York and all of them in\r\nPennsylvania; and he carried every state south of Maryland and beyond\r\nthe Appalachians. Adams did not get a single electoral vote in the South\r\nand West. The prophecy of the Hartford convention had been fulfilled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANDREW JACKSON]\r\n\r\nWhen Jackson took the oath of office on March 4, 1829, the government of\r\nthe United States entered into a new era. Until this time the\r\ninauguration of a President--even that of Jefferson, the apostle of\r\nsimplicity--had brought no rude shock to the course of affairs at the\r\ncapital. Hitherto the installation of a President meant that an\r\nold-fashioned gentleman, accompanied by a few servants, had driven to\r\nthe White House in his own coach, taken the oath with quiet dignity,\r\nappointed a few new men to the higher posts, continued in office the\r\nlong list of regular civil employees, and begun his administration with\r\nrespectable decorum. Jackson changed all this. When he was inaugurated,\r\nmen and women journeyed hundreds of miles to witness the ceremony. Great\r\nthrongs pressed into the White House, \"upset the bowls of punch, broke\r\nthe glasses, and stood with their muddy boots on the satin-covered\r\nchairs to see the people's President.\" If Jefferson's inauguration was,\r\nas he called it, the \"great revolution,\" Jackson's inauguration was a\r\ncataclysm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW DEMOCRACY AT WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n=The Spoils System.=--The staid and respectable society of Washington\r\nwas disturbed by this influx of farmers and frontiersmen. To speak of\r\npolitics became \"bad form\" among fashionable women. The clerks and\r\ncivil servants of the government who had enjoyed long and secure tenure\r\nof office became alarmed at the clamor of new men for their positions.\r\nDoubtless the major portion of them had opposed the election of Jackson\r\nand looked with feelings akin to contempt upon him and his followers.\r\nWith a hunter's instinct, Jackson scented his prey. Determined to have\r\nnone but his friends in office, he made a clean sweep, expelling old\r\nemployees to make room for men \"fresh from the people.\" This was a new\r\ncustom. Other Presidents had discharged a few officers for engaging in\r\nopposition politics. They had been careful in making appointments not to\r\nchoose inveterate enemies; but they discharged relatively few men on\r\naccount of their political views and partisan activities.\r\n\r\nBy wholesale removals and the frank selection of officers on party\r\ngrounds--a practice already well intrenched in New York--Jackson\r\nestablished the \"spoils system\" at Washington. The famous slogan, \"to\r\nthe victor belong the spoils of victory,\" became the avowed principle of\r\nthe national government. Statesmen like Calhoun denounced it; poets like\r\nJames Russell Lowell ridiculed it; faithful servants of the government\r\nsuffered under it; but it held undisturbed sway for half a century\r\nthereafter, each succeeding generation outdoing, if possible, its\r\npredecessor in the use of public office for political purposes. If any\r\none remarked that training and experience were necessary qualifications\r\nfor important public positions, he met Jackson's own profession of\r\nfaith: \"The duties of any public office are so simple or admit of being\r\nmade so simple that any man can in a short time become master of them.\"\r\n\r\n=The Tariff and Nullification.=--Jackson had not been installed in power\r\nvery long before he was compelled to choose between states' rights and\r\nnationalism. The immediate occasion of the trouble was the tariff--a\r\nmatter on which Jackson did not have any very decided views. His mind\r\ndid not run naturally to abstruse economic questions; and owing to the\r\ndivided opinion of the country it was \"good politics\" to be vague and\r\nambiguous in the controversy. Especially was this true, because the\r\ntariff issue was threatening to split the country into parties again.\r\n\r\n_The Development of the Policy of \"Protection.\"_--The war of 1812 and\r\nthe commercial policies of England which followed it had accentuated the\r\nneed for American economic independence. During that conflict, the\r\nUnited States, cut off from English manufactures as during the\r\nRevolution, built up home industries to meet the unusual call for iron,\r\nsteel, cloth, and other military and naval supplies as well as the\r\ndemands from ordinary markets. Iron foundries and textile mills sprang\r\nup as in the night; hundreds of business men invested fortunes in\r\nindustrial enterprises so essential to the military needs of the\r\ngovernment; and the people at large fell into the habit of buying\r\nAmerican-made goods again. As the London _Times_ tersely observed of the\r\nAmericans, \"their first war with England made them independent; their\r\nsecond war made them formidable.\"\r\n\r\nIn recognition of this state of affairs, the tariff of 1816 was\r\ndesigned: _first_, to prevent England from ruining these \"infant\r\nindustries\" by dumping the accumulated stores of years suddenly upon\r\nAmerican markets; and, _secondly_, to enlarge in the manufacturing\r\ncenters the demand for American agricultural produce. It accomplished\r\nthe purposes of its framers. It kept in operation the mills and furnaces\r\nso recently built. It multiplied the number of industrial workers and\r\nenhanced the demand for the produce of the soil. It brought about\r\nanother very important result. It turned the capital and enterprise of\r\nNew England from shipping to manufacturing, and converted her statesmen,\r\nonce friends of low tariffs, into ardent advocates of protection.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century, the Yankees had bent their\r\nenergies toward building and operating ships to carry produce from\r\nAmerica to Europe and manufactures from Europe to America. For this\r\nreason, they had opposed the tariff of 1816 calculated to increase\r\ndomestic production and cut down the carrying trade. Defeated in their\r\nefforts, they accepted the inevitable and turned to manufacturing. Soon\r\nthey were powerful friends of protection for American enterprise. As the\r\nmoney invested and the labor employed in the favored industries\r\nincreased, the demand for continued and heavier protection grew apace.\r\nEven the farmers who furnished raw materials, like wool, flax, and hemp,\r\nbegan to see eye to eye with the manufacturers. So the textile interests\r\nof New England, the iron masters of Connecticut, New Jersey, and\r\nPennsylvania, the wool, hemp, and flax growers of Ohio, Kentucky, and\r\nTennessee, and the sugar planters of Louisiana developed into a\r\nformidable combination in support of a high protective tariff.\r\n\r\n_The Planting States Oppose the Tariff._--In the meantime, the cotton\r\nstates on the seaboard had forgotten about the havoc wrought during the\r\nNapoleonic wars when their produce rotted because there were no ships to\r\ncarry it to Europe. The seas were now open. The area devoted to cotton\r\nhad swiftly expanded as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana were opened\r\nup. Cotton had in fact become \"king\" and the planters depended for their\r\nprosperity, as they thought, upon the sale of their staple to English\r\nmanufacturers whose spinning and weaving mills were the wonder of the\r\nworld. Manufacturing nothing and having to buy nearly everything except\r\nfarm produce and even much of that for slaves, the planters naturally\r\nwanted to purchase manufactures in the cheapest market, England, where\r\nthey sold most of their cotton. The tariff, they contended, raised the\r\nprice of the goods they had to buy and was thus in fact a tribute laid\r\non them for the benefit of the Northern mill owners.\r\n\r\n_The Tariff of Abominations._--They were overborne, however, in 1824 and\r\nagain in 1828 when Northern manufacturers and Western farmers forced\r\nCongress to make an upward revision of the tariff. The Act of 1828 known\r\nas \"the Tariff of Abominations,\" though slightly modified in 1832, was\r\n\"the straw which broke the camel's back.\" Southern leaders turned in\r\nrage against the whole system. The legislatures of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama denounced it; a general\r\nconvention of delegates held at Augusta issued a protest of defiance\r\nagainst it; and South Carolina, weary of verbal battles, decided to\r\nprevent its enforcement.\r\n\r\n_South Carolina Nullifies the Tariff._--The legislature of that state,\r\non October 26, 1832, passed a bill calling for a state convention which\r\nduly assembled in the following month. In no mood for compromise, it\r\nadopted the famous Ordinance of Nullification after a few days' debate.\r\nEvery line of this document was clear and firm. The tariff, it opened,\r\ngives \"bounties to classes and individuals ... at the expense and to the\r\ninjury and oppression of other classes and individuals\"; it is a\r\nviolation of the Constitution of the United States and therefore null\r\nand void; its enforcement in South Carolina is unlawful; if the federal\r\ngovernment attempts to coerce the state into obeying the law, \"the\r\npeople of this state will thenceforth hold themselves absolved from all\r\nfurther obligations to maintain or preserve their political connection\r\nwith the people of the other states and will forthwith proceed to\r\norganize a separate government and do all other acts and things which\r\nsovereign and independent states may of right do.\"\r\n\r\n_Southern States Condemn Nullification._--The answer of the country to\r\nthis note of defiance, couched in the language used in the Kentucky\r\nresolutions and by the New England Federalists during the war of 1812,\r\nwas quick and positive. The legislatures of the Southern states, while\r\ncondemning the tariff, repudiated the step which South Carolina had\r\ntaken. Georgia responded: \"We abhor the doctrine of nullification as\r\nneither a peaceful nor a constitutional remedy.\" Alabama found it\r\n\"unsound in theory and dangerous in practice.\" North Carolina replied\r\nthat it was \"revolutionary in character, subversive of the Constitution\r\nof the United States.\" Mississippi answered: \"It is disunion by\r\nforce--it is civil war.\" Virginia spoke more softly, condemning the\r\ntariff and sustaining the principle of the Virginia resolutions but\r\ndenying that South Carolina could find in them any sanction for her\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n_Jackson Firmly Upholds the Union._--The eyes of the country were turned\r\nupon Andrew Jackson. It was known that he looked with no friendly\r\nfeelings upon nullification, for, at a Jefferson dinner in the spring of\r\n1830 while the subject was in the air, he had with laconic firmness\r\nannounced a toast: \"Our federal union; it must be preserved.\" When two\r\nyears later the open challenge came from South Carolina, he replied that\r\nhe would enforce the law, saying with his frontier directness: \"If a\r\nsingle drop of blood shall be shed there in opposition to the laws of\r\nthe United States, I will hang the first man I can lay my hands on\r\nengaged in such conduct upon the first tree that I can reach.\" He made\r\nready to keep his word by preparing for the use of military and naval\r\nforces in sustaining the authority of the federal government. Then in a\r\nlong and impassioned proclamation to the people of South Carolina he\r\npointed out the national character of the union, and announced his\r\nsolemn resolve to preserve it by all constitutional means. Nullification\r\nhe branded as \"incompatible with the existence of the union,\r\ncontradicted expressly by the letter of the Constitution, unauthorized\r\nby its spirit, inconsistent with every principle on which it was\r\nfounded, and destructive of the great objects for which it was formed.\"\r\n\r\n_A Compromise._--In his messages to Congress, however, Jackson spoke the\r\nlanguage of conciliation. A few days before issuing his proclamation he\r\nsuggested that protection should be limited to the articles of domestic\r\nmanufacture indispensable to safety in war time, and shortly afterward\r\nhe asked for new legislation to aid him in enforcing the laws. With two\r\npropositions before it, one to remove the chief grounds for South\r\nCarolina's resistance and the other to apply force if it was continued,\r\nCongress bent its efforts to avoid a crisis. On February 12, 1833,\r\nHenry Clay laid before the Senate a compromise tariff bill providing for\r\nthe gradual reduction of the duties until by 1842 they would reach the\r\nlevel of the law which Calhoun had supported in 1816. About the same\r\ntime the \"force bill,\" designed to give the President ample authority in\r\nexecuting the law in South Carolina, was taken up. After a short but\r\nacrimonious debate, both measures were passed and signed by President\r\nJackson on the same day, March 2. Looking upon the reduction of the\r\ntariff as a complete vindication of her policy and an undoubted victory,\r\nSouth Carolina rescinded her ordinance and enacted another nullifying\r\nthe force bill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\r\n\r\nDANIEL WEBSTER]\r\n\r\n_The Webster-Hayne Debate._--Where the actual victory lay in this\r\nquarrel, long the subject of high dispute, need not concern us to-day.\r\nPerhaps the chief result of the whole affair was a clarification of the\r\nissue between the North and the South--a definite statement of the\r\nprinciples for which men on both sides were years afterward to lay down\r\ntheir lives. On behalf of nationalism and a perpetual union, the stanch\r\nold Democrat from Tennessee had, in his proclamation on nullification,\r\nspoken a language that admitted of only one meaning. On behalf of\r\nnullification, Senator Hayne, of South Carolina, a skilled lawyer and\r\ncourtly orator, had in a great speech delivered in the Senate in\r\nJanuary, 1830, set forth clearly and cogently the doctrine that the\r\nunion is a compact among sovereign states from which the parties may\r\nlawfully withdraw. It was this address that called into the arena\r\nDaniel Webster, Senator from Massachusetts, who, spreading the mantle\r\nof oblivion over the Hartford convention, delivered a reply to Hayne\r\nthat has been reckoned among the powerful orations of all time--a plea\r\nfor the supremacy of the Constitution and the national character of the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n=The War on the United States Bank.=--If events forced the issue of\r\nnationalism and nullification upon Jackson, the same could not be said\r\nof his attack on the bank. That institution, once denounced by every\r\ntrue Jeffersonian, had been reëstablished in 1816 under the\r\nadministration of Jefferson's disciple, James Madison. It had not been\r\nin operation very long, however, before it aroused bitter opposition,\r\nespecially in the South and the West. Its notes drove out of circulation\r\nthe paper currency of unsound banks chartered by the states, to the\r\ngreat anger of local financiers. It was accused of favoritism in making\r\nloans, of conferring special privileges upon politicians in return for\r\ntheir support at Washington. To all Jackson's followers it was \"an\r\ninsidious money power.\" One of them openly denounced it as an\r\ninstitution designed \"to strengthen the arm of wealth and counterpoise\r\nthe influence of extended suffrage in the disposition of public\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\nThis sentiment President Jackson fully shared. In his first message to\r\nCongress he assailed the bank in vigorous language. He declared that its\r\nconstitutionality was in doubt and alleged that it had failed to\r\nestablish a sound and uniform currency. If such an institution was\r\nnecessary, he continued, it should be a public bank, owned and managed\r\nby the government, not a private concern endowed with special privileges\r\nby it. In his second and third messages, Jackson came back to the\r\nsubject, leaving the decision, however, to \"an enlightened people and\r\ntheir representatives.\"\r\n\r\nMoved by this frank hostility and anxious for the future, the bank\r\napplied to Congress for a renewal of its charter in 1832, four years\r\nbefore the expiration of its life. Clay, with his eye upon the\r\npresidency and an issue for the campaign, warmly supported the\r\napplication. Congress, deeply impressed by his leadership, passed the\r\nbill granting the new charter, and sent the open defiance to Jackson.\r\nHis response was an instant veto. The battle was on and it raged with\r\nfury until the close of his second administration, ending in the\r\ndestruction of the bank, a disordered currency, and a national panic.\r\n\r\nIn his veto message, Jackson attacked the bank as unconstitutional and\r\neven hinted at corruption. He refused to assent to the proposition that\r\nthe Supreme Court had settled the question of constitutionality by the\r\ndecision in the McCulloch case. \"Each public officer,\" he argued, \"who\r\ntakes an oath to support the Constitution, swears that he will support\r\nit as he understands it, not as it is understood by others.\"\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with his veto and his declaration against the bank,\r\nJackson ordered the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government\r\ndeposits which formed a large part of the institution's funds. This\r\naction he followed up by an open charge that the bank had used money\r\nshamefully to secure the return of its supporters to Congress. The\r\nSenate, stung by this charge, solemnly resolved that Jackson had\r\n\"assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the\r\nConstitution and laws, but in derogation of both.\"\r\n\r\nThe effects of the destruction of the bank were widespread. When its\r\ncharter expired in 1836, banking was once more committed to the control\r\nof the states. The state legislatures, under a decision rendered by the\r\nSupreme Court after the death of Marshall, began to charter banks under\r\nstate ownership and control, with full power to issue paper money--this\r\nin spite of the provision in the Constitution that states shall not\r\nissue bills of credit or make anything but gold and silver coin legal\r\ntender in the payment of debts. Once more the country was flooded by\r\npaper currency of uncertain value. To make matters worse, Jackson\r\nadopted the practice of depositing huge amounts of government funds in\r\nthese banks, not forgetting to render favors to those institutions which\r\nsupported him in politics--\"pet banks,\" as they were styled at the\r\ntime. In 1837, partially, though by no means entirely, as a result of\r\nthe abolition of the bank, the country was plunged into one of the most\r\ndisastrous panics which it ever experienced.\r\n\r\n=Internal Improvements Checked.=--The bank had presented to Jackson a\r\nvery clear problem--one of destruction. Other questions were not so\r\nsimple, particularly the subject of federal appropriations in aid of\r\nroads and other internal improvements. Jefferson had strongly favored\r\ngovernment assistance in such matters, but his administration was\r\nfollowed by a reaction. Both Madison and Monroe vetoed acts of Congress\r\nappropriating public funds for public roads, advancing as their reason\r\nthe argument that the Constitution authorized no such laws. Jackson,\r\npuzzled by the clamor on both sides, followed their example without\r\nmaking the constitutional bar absolute. Congress, he thought, might\r\nlawfully build highways of a national and military value, but he\r\nstrongly deprecated attacks by local interests on the federal treasury.\r\n\r\n=The Triumph of the Executive Branch.=--Jackson's reëlection in 1832\r\nserved to confirm his opinion that he was the chosen leader of the\r\npeople, freed and instructed to ride rough shod over Congress and even\r\nthe courts. No President before or since ever entertained in times of\r\npeace such lofty notions of executive prerogative. The entire body of\r\nfederal employees he transformed into obedient servants of his wishes, a\r\nsign or a nod from him making and undoing the fortunes of the humble and\r\nthe mighty. His lawful cabinet of advisers, filling all of the high\r\nposts in the government, he treated with scant courtesy, preferring\r\nrather to secure his counsel and advice from an unofficial body of\r\nfriends and dependents who, owing to their secret methods and back\r\nstairs arrangements, became known as \"the kitchen cabinet.\" Under the\r\nleadership of a silent, astute, and resourceful politician, Amos\r\nKendall, this informal gathering of the faithful both gave and carried\r\nout decrees and orders, communicating the President's lightest wish or\r\nstrictest command to the uttermost part of the country. Resolutely and\r\nin the face of bitter opposition Jackson had removed the deposits from\r\nthe United States Bank. When the Senate protested against this arbitrary\r\nconduct, he did not rest until it was forced to expunge the resolution\r\nof condemnation; in time one of his lieutenants with his own hands was\r\nable to tear the censure from the records. When Chief Justice Marshall\r\nissued a decree against Georgia which did not suit him, Jackson,\r\naccording to tradition, blurted out that Marshall could go ahead and\r\nenforce his own orders. To the end he pursued his willful way, finally\r\neven choosing his own successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE WHIGS\r\n\r\n=Jackson's Measures Arouse Opposition.=--Measures so decided, policies\r\nso radical, and conduct so high-handed could not fail to arouse against\r\nJackson a deep and exasperated opposition. The truth is the conduct of\r\nhis entire administration profoundly disturbed the business and finances\r\nof the country. It was accompanied by conditions similar to those which\r\nexisted under the Articles of Confederation. A paper currency, almost as\r\nunstable and irritating as the worthless notes of revolutionary days,\r\nflooded the country, hindering the easy transaction of business. The use\r\nof federal funds for internal improvements, so vital to the exchange of\r\ncommodities which is the very life of industry, was blocked by executive\r\nvetoes. The Supreme Court, which, under Marshall, had held refractory\r\nstates to their obligations under the Constitution, was flouted; states'\r\nrights judges, deliberately selected by Jackson for the bench, began to\r\nsap and undermine the rulings of Marshall. The protective tariff, under\r\nwhich the textile industry of New England, the iron mills of\r\nPennsylvania, and the wool, flax, and hemp farms of the West had\r\nflourished, had received a severe blow in the compromise of 1833 which\r\npromised a steady reduction of duties. To cap the climax, Jackson's\r\nparty, casting aside the old and reputable name of Republican, boldly\r\nchose for its title the term \"Democrat,\" throwing down the gauntlet to\r\nevery conservative who doubted the omniscience of the people. All these\r\nthings worked together to evoke an opposition that was sharp and\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON RIDICULING CLAY'S TARIFF AND INTERNAL\r\nIMPROVEMENT PROGRAM]\r\n\r\n=Clay and the National Republicans.=--In this opposition movement,\r\nleadership fell to Henry Clay, a son of Kentucky, rather than to Daniel\r\nWebster of Massachusetts. Like Jackson, Clay was born in a home haunted\r\nby poverty. Left fatherless early and thrown upon his own resources, he\r\nwent from Virginia into Kentucky where by sheer force of intellect he\r\nrose to eminence in the profession of law. Without the martial gifts or\r\nthe martial spirit of Jackson, he slipped more easily into the social\r\nhabits of the East at the same time that he retained his hold on the\r\naffections of the boisterous West. Farmers of Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nKentucky loved him; financiers of New York and Philadelphia trusted him.\r\nHe was thus a leader well fitted to gather the forces of opposition\r\ninto union against Jackson.\r\n\r\nAround Clay's standard assembled a motley collection, representing every\r\nspecies of political opinion, united by one tie only--hatred for \"Old\r\nHickory.\" Nullifiers and less strenuous advocates of states' rights were\r\nyoked with nationalists of Webster's school; ardent protectionists were\r\nbound together with equally ardent free traders, all fraternizing in one\r\ngrand confusion of ideas under the title of \"National Republicans.\" Thus\r\nthe ancient and honorable term selected by Jefferson and his party, now\r\nabandoned by Jacksonian Democracy, was adroitly adopted to cover the\r\nsupporters of Clay. The platform of the party, however, embraced all the\r\nold Federalist principles: protection for American industry; internal\r\nimprovements; respect for the Supreme Court; resistance to executive\r\ntyranny; and denunciation of the spoils system. Though Jackson was\r\neasily victorious in 1832, the popular vote cast for Clay should have\r\ngiven him some doubts about the faith of \"the whole people\" in the\r\nwisdom of his \"reign.\"\r\n\r\n=Van Buren and the Panic of 1837.=--Nothing could shake the General's\r\nsuperb confidence. At the end of his second term he insisted on\r\nselecting his own successor; at a national convention, chosen by party\r\nvoters, but packed with his office holders and friends, he nominated\r\nMartin Van Buren of New York. Once more he proved his strength by\r\ncarrying the country for the Democrats. With a fine flourish, he\r\nattended the inauguration of Van Buren and then retired, amid the\r\napplause and tears of his devotees, to the Hermitage, his home in\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\nFortunately for him, Jackson escaped the odium of a disastrous panic\r\nwhich struck the country with terrible force in the following summer.\r\nAmong the contributory causes of this crisis, no doubt, were the\r\ndestruction of the bank and the issuance of the \"specie circular\" of\r\n1836 which required the purchasers of public lands to pay for them in\r\ncoin, instead of the paper notes of state banks. Whatever the dominating\r\ncause, the ruin was widespread. Bank after bank went under; boom towns\r\nin the West collapsed; Eastern mills shut down; and working people in\r\nthe industrial centers, starving from unemployment, begged for relief.\r\nVan Buren braved the storm, offering no measure of reform or assistance\r\nto the distracted people. He did seek security for government funds by\r\nsuggesting the removal of deposits from private banks and the\r\nestablishment of an independent treasury system, with government\r\ndepositaries for public funds, in several leading cities. This plan was\r\nfinally accepted by Congress in 1840.\r\n\r\nHad Van Buren been a captivating figure he might have lived down the\r\ndiscredit of the panic unjustly laid at his door; but he was far from\r\nbeing a favorite with the populace. Though a man of many talents, he\r\nowed his position to the quiet and adept management of Jackson rather\r\nthan to his own personal qualities. The men of the frontier did not care\r\nfor him. They suspected that he ate from \"gold plate\" and they could not\r\nforgive him for being an astute politician from New York. Still the\r\nDemocratic party, remembering Jackson's wishes, renominated him\r\nunanimously in 1840 and saw him go down to utter defeat.\r\n\r\n=The Whigs and General Harrison.=--By this time, the National\r\nRepublicans, now known as Whigs--a title taken from the party of\r\nopposition to the Crown in England, had learned many lessons. Taking a\r\nleaf out of the Democratic book, they nominated, not Clay of Kentucky,\r\nwell known for his views on the bank, the tariff, and internal\r\nimprovements, but a military hero, General William Henry Harrison, a man\r\nof uncertain political opinions. Harrison, a son of a Virginia signer of\r\nthe Declaration of Independence, sprang into public view by winning a\r\nbattle more famous than important, \"Tippecanoe\"--a brush with the\r\nIndians in Indiana. He added to his laurels by rendering praiseworthy\r\nservices during the war of 1812. When days of peace returned he was\r\nrewarded by a grateful people with a seat in Congress. Then he retired\r\nto quiet life in a little village near Cincinnati. Like Jackson he was\r\nheld to be a son of the South and the West. Like Jackson he was a\r\nmilitary hero, a lesser light, but still a light. Like Old Hickory he\r\nrode into office on a tide of popular feeling against an Eastern man\r\naccused of being something of an aristocrat. His personal popularity was\r\nsufficient. The Whigs who nominated him shrewdly refused to adopt a\r\nplatform or declare their belief in anything. When some Democrat\r\nasserted that Harrison was a backwoodsman whose sole wants were a jug of\r\nhard cider and a log cabin, the Whigs treated the remark not as an\r\ninsult but as proof positive that Harrison deserved the votes of Jackson\r\nmen. The jug and the cabin they proudly transformed into symbols of the\r\ncampaign, and won for their chieftain 234 electoral votes, while Van\r\nBuren got only sixty.\r\n\r\n=Harrison and Tyler.=--The Hero of Tippecanoe was not long to enjoy the\r\nfruits of his victory. The hungry horde of Whig office seekers descended\r\nupon him like wolves upon the fold. If he went out they waylaid him; if\r\nhe stayed indoors, he was besieged; not even his bed chamber was spared.\r\nHe was none too strong at best and he took a deep cold on the day of his\r\ninauguration. Between driving out Democrats and appeasing Whigs, he fell\r\nmortally ill. Before the end of a month he lay dead at the capitol.\r\n\r\nHarrison's successor, John Tyler, the Vice President, whom the Whigs had\r\nnominated to catch votes in Virginia, was more of a Democrat than\r\nanything else, though he was not partisan enough to please anybody. The\r\nWhigs railed at him because he would not approve the founding of another\r\nUnited States Bank. The Democrats stormed at him for refusing, until\r\nnear the end of his term, to sanction the annexation of Texas, which had\r\ndeclared its independence of Mexico in 1836. His entire administration,\r\nmarked by unseemly wrangling, produced only two measures of importance.\r\nThe Whigs, flushed by victory, with the aid of a few protectionist\r\nDemocrats, enacted, in 1842, a new tariff law destroying the compromise\r\nwhich had brought about the truce between the North and the South, in\r\nthe days of nullification. The distinguished leader of the Whigs, Daniel\r\nWebster, as Secretary of State, in negotiation with Lord Ashburton\r\nrepresenting Great Britain, settled the long-standing dispute between\r\nthe two countries over the Maine boundary. A year after closing this\r\nchapter in American diplomacy, Webster withdrew to private life, leaving\r\nthe President to endure alone the buffets of political fortune.\r\n\r\nTo the end, the Whigs regarded Tyler as a traitor to their cause; but\r\nthe judgment of history is that it was a case of the biter bitten. They\r\nhad nominated him for the vice presidency as a man of views acceptable\r\nto Southern Democrats in order to catch their votes, little reckoning\r\nwith the chances of his becoming President. Tyler had not deceived them\r\nand, thoroughly soured, he left the White House in 1845 not to appear in\r\npublic life again until the days of secession, when he espoused the\r\nSouthern confederacy. Jacksonian Democracy, with new leadership, serving\r\na new cause--slavery--was returned to power under James K. Polk, a\r\nfriend of the General from Tennessee. A few grains of sand were to run\r\nthrough the hour glass before the Whig party was to be broken and\r\nscattered as the Federalists had been more than a generation before.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERACTION OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN OPINION\r\n\r\n=Democracy in England and France.=--During the period of Jacksonian\r\nDemocracy, as in all epochs of ferment, there was a close relation\r\nbetween the thought of the New World and the Old. In England, the\r\nsuccesses of the American experiment were used as arguments in favor of\r\noverthrowing the aristocracy which George III had manipulated with such\r\neffect against America half a century before. In the United States, on\r\nthe other hand, conservatives like Chancellor Kent, the stout opponent\r\nof manhood suffrage in New York, cited the riots of the British working\r\nclasses as a warning against admitting the same classes to a share in\r\nthe government of the United States. Along with the agitation of opinion\r\nwent epoch-making events. In 1832, the year of Jackson's second\r\ntriumph, the British Parliament passed its first reform bill, which\r\nconferred the ballot--not on workingmen as yet--but on mill owners and\r\nshopkeepers whom the landlords regarded with genuine horror. The initial\r\nstep was thus taken in breaking down the privileges of the landed\r\naristocracy and the rich merchants of England.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a popular revolution occurred in France. The Bourbon\r\nfamily, restored to the throne of France by the allied powers after\r\ntheir victory over Napoleon in 1815, had embarked upon a policy of\r\narbitrary government. To use the familiar phrase, they had learned\r\nnothing and forgotten nothing. Charles X, who came to the throne in\r\n1824, set to work with zeal to undo the results of the French\r\nRevolution, to stifle the press, restrict the suffrage, and restore the\r\nclergy and the nobility to their ancient rights. His policy encountered\r\nequally zealous opposition and in 1830 he was overthrown. The popular\r\nparty, under the leadership of Lafayette, established, not a republic as\r\nsome of the radicals had hoped, but a \"liberal\" middle-class monarchy\r\nunder Louis Philippe. This second French Revolution made a profound\r\nimpression on Americans, convincing them that the whole world was moving\r\ntoward democracy. The mayor, aldermen, and citizens of New York City\r\njoined in a great parade to celebrate the fall of the Bourbons. Mingled\r\nwith cheers for the new order in France were hurrahs for \"the people's\r\nown, Andrew Jackson, the Hero of New Orleans and President of the United\r\nStates!\"\r\n\r\n=European Interest in America.=--To the older and more settled\r\nEuropeans, the democratic experiment in America was either a menace or\r\nan inspiration. Conservatives viewed it with anxiety; liberals with\r\noptimism. Far-sighted leaders could see that the tide of democracy was\r\nrising all over the world and could not be stayed. Naturally the country\r\nthat had advanced furthest along the new course was the place in which\r\nto find arguments for and against proposals that Europe should make\r\nexperiments of the same character.\r\n\r\n=De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_.=--In addition to the casual\r\ntraveler there began to visit the United States the thoughtful observer\r\nbent on finding out what manner of nation this was springing up in the\r\nwilderness. Those who looked with sympathy upon the growing popular\r\nforces of England and France found in the United States, in spite of\r\nmany blemishes and defects, a guarantee for the future of the people's\r\nrule in the Old World. One of these, Alexis de Tocqueville, a French\r\nliberal of mildly democratic sympathies, made a journey to this country\r\nin 1831; he described in a very remarkable volume, _Democracy in\r\nAmerica_, the grand experiment as he saw it. On the whole he was\r\nconvinced. After examining with a critical eye the life and labor of the\r\nAmerican people, as well as the constitutions of the states and the\r\nnation, he came to the conclusion that democracy with all its faults was\r\nboth inevitable and successful. Slavery he thought was a painful\r\ncontrast to the other features of American life, and he foresaw what\r\nproved to be the irrepressible conflict over it. He believed that\r\nthrough blundering the people were destined to learn the highest of all\r\narts, self-government on a grand scale. The absence of a leisure class,\r\ndevoted to no calling or profession, merely enjoying the refinements of\r\nlife and adding to its graces--the flaw in American culture that gave\r\ndeep distress to many a European leader--de Tocqueville thought a\r\nnecessary virtue in the republic. \"Amongst a democratic people where\r\nthere is no hereditary wealth, every man works to earn a living, or has\r\nworked, or is born of parents who have worked. A notion of labor is\r\ntherefore presented to the mind on every side as the necessary, natural,\r\nand honest condition of human existence.\" It was this notion of a\r\ngovernment in the hands of people who labored that struck the French\r\npublicist as the most significant fact in the modern world.\r\n\r\n=Harriet Martineau's Visit to America.=--This phase of American life\r\nalso profoundly impressed the brilliant English writer, Harriet\r\nMartineau. She saw all parts of the country, the homes of the rich and\r\nthe log cabins of the frontier; she traveled in stagecoaches, canal\r\nboats, and on horseback; and visited sessions of Congress and auctions\r\nat slave markets. She tried to view the country impartially and the\r\nthing that left the deepest mark on her mind was the solidarity of the\r\npeople in one great political body. \"However various may be the tribes\r\nof inhabitants in those states, whatever part of the world may have been\r\ntheir birthplace, or that of their fathers, however broken may be their\r\nlanguage, however servile or noble their employments, however exalted or\r\ndespised their state, all are declared to be bound together by equal\r\npolitical obligations.... In that self-governing country all are held to\r\nhave an equal interest in the principles of its institutions and to be\r\nbound in equal duty to watch their workings.\" Miss Martineau was also\r\nimpressed with the passion of Americans for land ownership and\r\ncontrasted the United States favorably with England where the tillers of\r\nthe soil were either tenants or laborers for wages.\r\n\r\n=Adverse Criticism.=--By no means all observers and writers were\r\nconvinced that America was a success. The fastidious traveler, Mrs.\r\nTrollope, who thought the English system of church and state was ideal,\r\nsaw in the United States only roughness and ignorance. She lamented the\r\n\"total and universal want of manners both in males and females,\" adding\r\nthat while \"they appear to have clear heads and active intellects,\"\r\nthere was \"no charm, no grace in their conversation.\" She found\r\neverywhere a lack of reverence for kings, learning, and rank. Other\r\ncritics were even more savage. The editor of the _Foreign Quarterly_\r\npetulantly exclaimed that the United States was \"a brigand\r\nconfederation.\" Charles Dickens declared the country to be \"so maimed\r\nand lame, so full of sores and ulcers that her best friends turn from\r\nthe loathsome creature in disgust.\" Sydney Smith, editor of the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, was never tired of trying his caustic wit at the\r\nexpense of America. \"Their Franklins and Washingtons and all the other\r\nsages and heroes of their revolution were born and bred subjects of the\r\nking of England,\" he observed in 1820. \"During the thirty or forty\r\nyears of their independence they have done absolutely nothing for the\r\nsciences, for the arts, for literature, or even for the statesmanlike\r\nstudies of politics or political economy.... In the four quarters of the\r\nglobe who reads an American book? Or goes to an American play? Or looks\r\nat an American picture or statue?\" To put a sharp sting into his taunt\r\nhe added, forgetting by whose authority slavery was introduced and\r\nfostered: \"Under which of the old tyrannical governments of Europe is\r\nevery sixth man a slave whom his fellow creatures may buy and sell?\"\r\n\r\nSome Americans, while resenting the hasty and often superficial\r\njudgments of European writers, winced under their satire and took\r\nthought about certain particulars in the indictments brought against\r\nthem. The mass of the people, however, bent on the great experiment,\r\ngave little heed to carping critics who saw the flaws and not the\r\nachievements of our country--critics who were in fact less interested in\r\nAmerica than in preventing the rise and growth of democracy in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nJ.S.

When he made this astounding declaration, he doubtless had\r\nbefore his mind's eye the great stretches of unoccupied lands between\r\nthe Appalachians and the Mississippi. He also had before him the history\r\nof the English colonies, which told him of the two centuries required to\r\nsettle the seaboard region. To practical men, his prophecy did not seem\r\nfar wrong; but before the lapse of half that time there appeared beyond\r\nthe Mississippi a tier of new states, reaching from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nto the southern boundary of Minnesota, and a new commonwealth on the\r\nPacific Ocean where American emigrants had raised the Bear flag of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANCE OF THE MIDDLE BORDER\r\n\r\n=Missouri.=--When the middle of the nineteenth century had been reached,\r\nthe Mississippi River, which Daniel Boone, the intrepid hunter, had\r\ncrossed during Washington's administration \"to escape from civilization\"\r\nin Kentucky, had become the waterway for a vast empire. The center of\r\npopulation of the United States had passed to the Ohio Valley. Missouri,\r\nwith its wide reaches of rich lands, low-lying, level, and fertile, well\r\nadapted to hemp raising, had drawn to its borders thousands of planters\r\nfrom the old Southern states--from Virginia and the Carolinas as well as\r\nfrom Kentucky and Tennessee. When the great compromise of 1820-21\r\nadmitted her to the union, wearing \"every jewel of sovereignty,\" as a\r\nflorid orator announced, migratory slave owners were assured that their\r\nproperty would be safe in Missouri. Along the western shore of the\r\nMississippi and on both banks of the Missouri to the uttermost limits of\r\nthe state, plantations tilled by bondmen spread out in broad expanses.\r\nIn the neighborhood of Jefferson City the slaves numbered more than a\r\nfourth of the population.\r\n\r\nInto this stream of migration from the planting South flowed another\r\ncurrent of land-tilling farmers; some from Kentucky, Tennessee, and\r\nMississippi, driven out by the onrush of the planters buying and\r\nconsolidating small farms into vast estates; and still more from the\r\nEast and the Old World. To the northwest over against Iowa and to the\r\nsouthwest against Arkansas, these yeomen laid out farms to be tilled by\r\ntheir own labor. In those regions the number of slaves seldom rose above\r\nfive or six per cent of the population. The old French post, St. Louis,\r\nenriched by the fur trade of the Far West and the steamboat traffic of\r\nthe river, grew into a thriving commercial city, including among its\r\nseventy-five thousand inhabitants in 1850 nearly forty thousand\r\nforeigners, German immigrants from Pennsylvania and Europe being the\r\nlargest single element.\r\n\r\n=Arkansas.=--Below Missouri lay the territory of Arkansas, which had\r\nlong been the paradise of the swarthy hunter and the restless\r\nfrontiersman fleeing from the advancing borders of farm and town. In\r\nsearch of the life, wild and free, where the rifle supplied the game and\r\na few acres of ground the corn and potatoes, they had filtered into the\r\nterritory in an unending drift, \"squatting\" on the land. Without so much\r\nas asking the leave of any government, territorial or national, they\r\nclaimed as their own the soil on which they first planted their feet.\r\nLike the Cherokee Indians, whom they had as neighbors, whose very\r\ncustoms and dress they sometimes adopted, the squatters spent their days\r\nin the midst of rough plenty, beset by chills, fevers, and the ills of\r\nthe flesh, but for many years unvexed by political troubles or the\r\nrestrictions of civilized life.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for them, however, the fertile valleys of the Mississippi\r\nand Arkansas were well adapted to the cultivation of cotton and tobacco\r\nand their sylvan peace was soon broken by an invasion of planters. The\r\nnewcomers, with their servile workers, spread upward in the valley\r\ntoward Missouri and along the southern border westward to the Red River.\r\nIn time the slaves in the tier of counties against Louisiana ranged from\r\nthirty to seventy per cent of the population. This marked the doom of\r\nthe small farmer, swept Arkansas into the main current of planting\r\npolitics, and led to a powerful lobby at Washington in favor of\r\nadmission to the union, a boon granted in 1836.\r\n\r\n=Michigan.=--In accordance with a well-established custom, a free state\r\nwas admitted to the union to balance a slave state. In 1833, the people\r\nof Michigan, a territory ten times the size of Connecticut, announced\r\nthat the time had come for them to enjoy the privileges of a\r\ncommonwealth. All along the southern border the land had been occupied\r\nlargely by pioneers from New England, who built prim farmhouses and\r\nadopted the town-meeting plan of self-government after the fashion of\r\nthe old home. The famous post of Detroit was growing into a flourishing\r\ncity as the boats plying on the Great Lakes carried travelers, settlers,\r\nand freight through the narrows. In all, according to the census, there\r\nwere more than ninety thousand inhabitants in the territory; so it was\r\nnot without warrant that they clamored for statehood. Congress, busy as\r\never with politics, delayed; and the inhabitants of Michigan, unable to\r\nrestrain their impatience, called a convention, drew up a constitution,\r\nand started a lively quarrel with Ohio over the southern boundary. The\r\nhand of Congress was now forced. Objections were made to the new\r\nconstitution on the ground that it gave the ballot to all free white\r\nmales, including aliens not yet naturalized; but the protests were\r\noverborne in a long debate. The boundary was fixed, and Michigan, though\r\nshorn of some of the land she claimed, came into the union in 1837.\r\n\r\n=Wisconsin.=--Across Lake Michigan to the west lay the territory of\r\nWisconsin, which shared with Michigan the interesting history of the\r\nNorthwest, running back into the heroic days when French hunters and\r\nmissionaries were planning a French empire for the great monarch, Louis\r\nXIV. It will not be forgotten that the French rangers of the woods, the\r\nblack-robed priests, prepared for sacrifice, even to death, the trappers\r\nof the French agencies, and the French explorers--Marquette, Joliet, and\r\nMenard--were the first white men to paddle their frail barks through the\r\nnorthern waters. They first blazed their trails into the black forests\r\nand left traces of their work in the names of portages and little\r\nvillages. It was from these forests that Red Men in full war paint\r\njourneyed far to fight under the _fleur-de-lis_ of France when the\r\nsoldiers of King Louis made their last stand at Quebec and Montreal\r\nagainst the imperial arms of Britain. It was here that the British flag\r\nwas planted in 1761 and that the great Pontiac conspiracy was formed two\r\nyears later to overthrow British dominion.\r\n\r\nWhen, a generation afterward, the Stars and Stripes supplanted the Union\r\nJack, the French were still almost the only white men in the region.\r\nThey were soon joined by hustling Yankee fur traders who did battle\r\nroyal against British interlopers. The traders cut their way through\r\nforest trails and laid out the routes through lake and stream and over\r\nportages for the settlers and their families from the states \"back\r\nEast.\" It was the forest ranger who discovered the water power later\r\nused to turn the busy mills grinding the grain from the spreading farm\r\nlands. In the wake of the fur hunters, forest men, and farmers came\r\nminers from Kentucky, Tennessee, and Missouri crowding in to exploit the\r\nlead ores of the northwest, some of them bringing slaves to work their\r\nclaims. Had it not been for the gold fever of 1849 that drew the\r\nwielders of pick and shovel to the Far West, Wisconsin would early have\r\ntaken high rank among the mining regions of the country.\r\n\r\nFrom a favorable point of vantage on Lake Michigan, the village of\r\nMilwaukee, a center for lumber and grain transport and a place of entry\r\nfor Eastern goods, grew into a thriving city. It claimed twenty thousand\r\ninhabitants, when in 1848 Congress admitted Wisconsin to the union.\r\nAlready the Germans, Irish, and Scandinavians had found their way into\r\nthe territory. They joined Americans from the older states in clearing\r\nforests, building roads, transforming trails into highways, erecting\r\nmills, and connecting streams with canals to make a network of routes\r\nfor the traffic that poured to and from the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n=Iowa and Minnesota.=--To the southwest of Wisconsin beyond the\r\nMississippi, where the tall grass of the prairies waved like the sea,\r\nfarmers from New England, New York, and Ohio had prepared Iowa for\r\nstatehood. A tide of immigration that might have flowed into Missouri\r\nwent northward; for freemen, unaccustomed to slavery and slave markets,\r\npreferred the open country above the compromise line. With incredible\r\nswiftness, they spread farms westward from the Mississippi. With Yankee\r\ningenuity they turned to trading on the river, building before 1836\r\nthree prosperous centers of traffic: Dubuque, Davenport, and Burlington.\r\nTrue to their old traditions, they founded colleges and academies that\r\nreligion and learning might be cherished on the frontier as in the\r\nstates from which they came. Prepared for self-government, the Iowans\r\nlaid siege to the door of Congress and were admitted to the union in\r\n1846.\r\n\r\nAbove Iowa, on the Mississippi, lay the territory of Minnesota--the home\r\nof the Dakotas, the Ojibways, and the Sioux. Like Michigan and\r\nWisconsin, it had been explored early by the French scouts, and the\r\nfirst white settlement was the little French village of Mendota. To the\r\npeople of the United States, the resources of the country were first\r\nrevealed by the historic journey of Zebulon Pike in 1805 and by American\r\nfur traders who were quick to take advantage of the opportunity to ply\r\ntheir arts of hunting and bartering in fresh fields. In 1839 an\r\nAmerican settlement was planted at Marina on the St. Croix, the outpost\r\nof advancing civilization. Within twenty years, the territory, boasting\r\na population of 150,000, asked for admission to the union. In 1858 the\r\nplea was granted and Minnesota showed her gratitude three years later by\r\nbeing first among the states to offer troops to Lincoln in the hour of\r\nperil.\r\n\r\n\r\nON TO THE PACIFIC--TEXAS AND THE MEXICAN WAR\r\n\r\n=The Uniformity of the Middle West.=--There was a certain monotony about\r\npioneering in the Northwest and on the middle border. As the long\r\nstretches of land were cleared or prepared for the plow, they were laid\r\nout like checkerboards into squares of forty, eighty, one hundred sixty,\r\nor more acres, each the seat of a homestead. There was a striking\r\nuniformity also about the endless succession of fertile fields spreading\r\nfar and wide under the hot summer sun. No majestic mountains relieved\r\nthe sweep of the prairie. Few monuments of other races and antiquity\r\nwere there to awaken curiosity about the region. No sonorous bells in\r\nold missions rang out the time of day. The chaffering Red Man bartering\r\nblankets and furs for powder and whisky had passed farther on. The\r\npopulation was made up of plain farmers and their families engaged in\r\nsevere and unbroken labor, chopping down trees, draining fever-breeding\r\nswamps, breaking new ground, and planting from year to year the same\r\nrotation of crops. Nearly all the settlers were of native American stock\r\ninto whose frugal and industrious lives the later Irish and German\r\nimmigrants fitted, on the whole, with little friction. Even the Dutch\r\noven fell before the cast-iron cooking stove. Happiness and sorrow,\r\ndespair and hope were there, but all encompassed by the heavy tedium of\r\nprosaic sameness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SANTA BARBARA MISSION]\r\n\r\n=A Contrast in the Far West and Southwest.=--As George Rogers Clark and\r\nDaniel Boone had stirred the snug Americans of the seaboard to seek\r\ntheir fortunes beyond the Appalachians, so now Kit Carson, James Bowie,\r\nSam Houston, Davy Crockett, and John C. Frémont were to lead the way\r\ninto a new land, only a part of which was under the American flag. The\r\nsetting for this new scene in the westward movement was thrown out in a\r\nwide sweep from the headwaters of the Mississippi to the banks of the\r\nRio Grande; from the valleys of the Sabine and Red rivers to Montana and\r\nthe Pacific slope. In comparison with the middle border, this region\r\npresented such startling diversities that only the eye of faith could\r\nforesee the unifying power of nationalism binding its communities with\r\nthe older sections of the country. What contrasts indeed! The blue grass\r\nregion of Kentucky or the rich, black soil of Illinois--the painted\r\ndesert, the home of the sage brush and the coyote! The level prairies of\r\nIowa--the mighty Rockies shouldering themselves high against the\r\nhorizon! The long bleak winters of Wisconsin--California of endless\r\nsummer! The log churches of Indiana or Illinois--the quaint missions of\r\nSan Antonio, Tucson, and Santa Barbara! The little state of\r\nDelaware--the empire of Texas, one hundred and twenty times its area!\r\nAnd scattered about through the Southwest were signs of an ancient\r\ncivilization--fragments of four-and five-story dwellings, ruined dams,\r\naqueducts, and broken canals, which told of once prosperous peoples\r\nwho, by art and science, had conquered the aridity of the desert and\r\nlifted themselves in the scale of culture above the savages of the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThe settlers of this vast empire were to be as diverse in their origins\r\nand habits as those of the colonies on the coast had been. Americans of\r\nEnglish, Irish, and Scotch-Irish descent came as usual from the Eastern\r\nstates. To them were added the migratory Germans as well. Now for the\r\nfirst time came throngs of Scandinavians. Some were to make their homes\r\non quiet farms as the border advanced against the setting sun. Others\r\nwere to be Indian scouts, trappers, fur hunters, miners, cowboys, Texas\r\nplanters, keepers of lonely posts on the plain and the desert, stage\r\ndrivers, pilots of wagon trains, pony riders, fruit growers, \"lumber\r\njacks,\" and smelter workers. One common bond united them--a passion for\r\nthe self-government accorded to states. As soon as a few thousand\r\nsettlers came together in a single territory, there arose a mighty shout\r\nfor a position beside the staid commonwealths of the East and the South.\r\nStatehood meant to the pioneers self-government, dignity, and the right\r\nto dispose of land, minerals, and timber in their own way. In the quest\r\nfor this local autonomy there arose many a wordy contest in Congress,\r\neach of the political parties lending a helping hand in the admission of\r\na state when it gave promise of adding new congressmen of the \"right\r\npolitical persuasion,\" to use the current phrase.\r\n\r\n=Southern Planters and Texas.=--While the farmers of the North found the\r\nbroad acres of the Western prairies stretching on before them apparently\r\nin endless expanse, it was far different with the Southern planters.\r\nEver active in their search for new fields as they exhausted the virgin\r\nsoil of the older states, the restless subjects of King Cotton quickly\r\nreached the frontier of Louisiana. There they paused; but only for a\r\nmoment. The fertile land of Texas just across the boundary lured them on\r\nand the Mexican republic to which it belonged extended to them a more\r\nthan generous welcome. Little realizing the perils lurking in a\r\n\"peaceful penetration,\" the authorities at Mexico City opened wide the\r\ndoors and made large grants of land to American contractors, who agreed\r\nto bring a number of families into Texas. The omnipresent Yankee, in the\r\nperson of Moses Austin of Connecticut, hearing of this good news in the\r\nSouthwest, obtained a grant in 1820 to settle three hundred Americans\r\nnear Bexar--a commission finally carried out to the letter by his son\r\nand celebrated in the name given to the present capital of the state of\r\nTexas. Within a decade some twenty thousand Americans had crossed the\r\nborder.\r\n\r\n=Mexico Closes the Door.=--The government of Mexico, unaccustomed to\r\nsuch enterprise and thoroughly frightened by its extent, drew back in\r\ndismay. Its fears were increased as quarrels broke out between the\r\nAmericans and the natives in Texas. Fear grew into consternation when\r\nefforts were made by President Jackson to buy the territory for the\r\nUnited States. Mexico then sought to close the flood gates. It stopped\r\nall American colonization schemes, canceled many of the land grants, put\r\na tariff on farming implements, and abolished slavery. These barriers\r\nwere raised too late. A call for help ran through the western border of\r\nthe United States. The sentinels of the frontier answered. Davy\r\nCrockett, the noted frontiersman, bear hunter, and backwoods politician;\r\nJames Bowie, the dexterous wielder of the knife that to this day bears\r\nhis name; and Sam Houston, warrior and pioneer, rushed to the aid of\r\ntheir countrymen in Texas. Unacquainted with the niceties of diplomacy,\r\nimpatient at the formalities of international law, they soon made it\r\nknown that in spite of Mexican sovereignty they would be their own\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\n=The Independence of Texas Declared.=--Numbering only about one-fourth\r\nof the population in Texas, they raised the standard of revolt in 1836\r\nand summoned a convention. Following in the footsteps of their\r\nancestors, they issued a declaration of independence signed mainly by\r\nAmericans from the slave states. Anticipating that the government of\r\nMexico would not quietly accept their word of defiance as final, they\r\ndispatched a force to repel \"the invading army,\" as General Houston\r\ncalled the troops advancing under the command of Santa Ana, the Mexican\r\npresident. A portion of the Texan soldiers took their stand in the\r\nAlamo, an old Spanish mission in the cottonwood trees in the town of San\r\nAntonio. Instead of obeying the order to blow up the mission and retire,\r\nthey held their ground until they were completely surrounded and cut off\r\nfrom all help. Refusing to surrender, they fought to the bitter end, the\r\nlast man falling a victim to the sword. Vengeance was swift. Within\r\nthree months General Houston overwhelmed Santa Ana at the San Jacinto,\r\ntaking him prisoner of war and putting an end to all hopes for the\r\nrestoration of Mexican sovereignty over Texas.\r\n\r\nThe Lone Star Republic, with Houston at the head, then sought admission\r\nto the United States. This seemed at first an easy matter. All that was\r\nrequired to bring it about appeared to be a treaty annexing Texas to the\r\nunion. Moreover, President Jackson, at the height of his popularity, had\r\na warm regard for General Houston and, with his usual sympathy for rough\r\nand ready ways of doing things, approved the transaction. Through an\r\nAmerican representative in Mexico, Jackson had long and anxiously\r\nlabored, by means none too nice, to wring from the Mexican republic the\r\ncession of the coveted territory. When the Texans took matters into\r\ntheir own hands, he was more than pleased; but he could not marshal the\r\napproval of two-thirds of the Senators required for a treaty of\r\nannexation. Cautious as well as impetuous, Jackson did not press the\r\nissue; he went out of office in 1837 with Texas uncertain as to her\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n=Northern Opposition to Annexation.=--All through the North the\r\nopposition to annexation was clear and strong. Anti-slavery agitators\r\ncould hardly find words savage enough to express their feelings.\r\n\"Texas,\" exclaimed Channing in a letter to Clay, \"is but the first step\r\nof aggression. I trust indeed that Providence will beat back and humble\r\nour cupidity and ambition. I now ask whether as a people we are\r\nprepared to seize on a neighboring territory for the end of extending\r\nslavery? I ask whether as a people we can stand forth in the sight of\r\nGod, in the sight of nations, and adopt this atrocious policy? Sooner\r\nperish! Sooner be our name blotted out from the record of nations!\"\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison called for the secession of the Northern states\r\nif Texas was brought into the union with slavery. John Quincy Adams\r\nwarned his countrymen that they were treading in the path of the\r\nimperialism that had brought the nations of antiquity to judgment and\r\ndestruction. Henry Clay, the Whig candidate for President, taking into\r\naccount changing public sentiment, blew hot and cold, losing the state\r\nof New York and the election of 1844 by giving a qualified approval of\r\nannexation. In the same campaign, the Democrats boldly demanded the\r\n\"Reannexation of Texas,\" based on claims which the United States once\r\nhad to Spanish territory beyond the Sabine River.\r\n\r\n=Annexation.=--The politicians were disposed to walk very warily. Van\r\nBuren, at heart opposed to slavery extension, refused to press the issue\r\nof annexation. Tyler, a pro-slavery Democrat from Virginia, by a strange\r\nfling of fortune carried into office as a nominal Whig, kept his mind\r\nfirmly fixed on the idea of reëlection and let the troublesome matter\r\nrest until the end of his administration was in sight. He then listened\r\nwith favor to the voice of the South. Calhoun stated what seemed to be a\r\nconvincing argument: All good Americans have their hearts set on the\r\nConstitution; the admission of Texas is absolutely essential to the\r\npreservation of the union; it will give a balance of power to the South\r\nas against the North growing with incredible swiftness in wealth and\r\npopulation. Tyler, impressed by the plea, appointed Calhoun to the\r\noffice of Secretary of State in 1844, authorizing him to negotiate the\r\ntreaty of annexation--a commission at once executed. This scheme was\r\nblocked in the Senate where the necessary two-thirds vote could not be\r\nsecured. Balked but not defeated, the advocates of annexation drew up a\r\njoint resolution which required only a majority vote in both houses,\r\nand in February of the next year, just before Tyler gave way to Polk,\r\nthey pushed it through Congress. So Texas, amid the groans of Boston and\r\nthe hurrahs of Charleston, folded up her flag and came into the union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEXAS AND THE TERRITORY IN DISPUTE]\r\n\r\n=The Mexican War.=--The inevitable war with Mexico, foretold by the\r\nabolitionists and feared by Henry Clay, ensued, the ostensible cause\r\nbeing a dispute over the boundaries of the new state. The Texans claimed\r\nall the lands down to the Rio Grande. The Mexicans placed the border of\r\nTexas at the Nueces River and a line drawn thence in a northerly\r\ndirection. President Polk, accepting the Texan view of the controversy,\r\nordered General Zachary Taylor to move beyond the Nueces in defense of\r\nAmerican sovereignty. This act of power, deemed by the Mexicans an\r\ninvasion of their territory, was followed by an attack on our troops.\r\n\r\nPresident Polk, not displeased with the turn of events, announced that\r\nAmerican blood had been \"spilled on American soil\" and that war existed\r\n\"by the act of Mexico.\" Congress, in a burst of patriotic fervor,\r\nbrushed aside the protests of those who deplored the conduct of the\r\ngovernment as wanton aggression on a weaker nation and granted money and\r\nsupplies to prosecute the war. The few Whigs in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, who refused to vote in favor of taking up arms,\r\naccepted the inevitable with such good grace as they could command. All\r\nthrough the South and the West the war was popular. New England\r\ngrumbled, but gave loyal, if not enthusiastic, support to a conflict\r\nprecipitated by policies not of its own choosing. Only a handful of firm\r\nobjectors held out. James Russell Lowell, in his _Biglow Papers_, flung\r\nscorn and sarcasm to the bitter end.\r\n\r\n=The Outcome of the War.=--The foregone conclusion was soon reached.\r\nGeneral Taylor might have delivered the fatal thrust from northern\r\nMexico if politics had not intervened. Polk, anxious to avoid raising up\r\nanother military hero for the Whigs to nominate for President, decided\r\nto divide the honors by sending General Scott to strike a blow at the\r\ncapital, Mexico City. The deed was done with speed and pomp and two\r\nheroes were lifted into presidential possibilities. In the Far West a\r\nthird candidate was made, John C. Frémont, who, in coöperation with\r\nCommodores Sloat and Stockton and General Kearney, planted the Stars and\r\nStripes on the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1848, the Mexicans came to terms, ceding to the victor\r\nCalifornia, Arizona, New Mexico, and more--a domain greater in extent\r\nthan the combined areas of France and Germany. As a salve to the wound,\r\nthe vanquished received fifteen million dollars in cash and the\r\ncancellation of many claims held by American citizens. Five years later,\r\nthrough the negotiations of James Gadsden, a further cession of lands\r\nalong the southern border of Arizona and New Mexico was secured on\r\npayment of ten million dollars.\r\n\r\n=General Taylor Elected President.=--The ink was hardly dry upon the\r\ntreaty that closed the war before \"rough and ready\" General Taylor, a\r\nslave owner from Louisiana, \"a Whig,\" as he said, \"but not an ultra\r\nWhig,\" was put forward as the Whig candidate for President. He himself\r\nhad not voted for years and he was fairly innocent in matters political.\r\nThe tariff, the currency, and internal improvements, with a magnificent\r\ngesture he referred to the people's representatives in Congress,\r\noffering to enforce the laws as made, if elected. Clay's followers\r\nmourned. Polk stormed but could not win even a renomination at the hands\r\nof the Democrats. So it came about that the hero of Buena Vista,\r\ncelebrated for his laconic order, \"Give 'em a little more grape, Captain\r\nBragg,\" became President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFIC COAST AND UTAH\r\n\r\n=Oregon.=--Closely associated in the popular mind with the contest about\r\nthe affairs of Texas was a dispute with Great Britain over the\r\npossession of territory in Oregon. In their presidential campaign of\r\n1844, the Democrats had coupled with the slogan, \"The Reannexation of\r\nTexas,\" two other cries, \"The Reoccupation of Oregon,\" and \"Fifty-four\r\nForty or Fight.\" The last two slogans were founded on American\r\ndiscoveries and explorations in the Far Northwest. Their appearance in\r\npolitics showed that the distant Oregon country, larger in area than New\r\nEngland, New York, and Pennsylvania combined, was at last receiving from\r\nthe nation the attention which its importance warranted.\r\n\r\n_Joint Occupation and Settlement._--Both England and the United States\r\nhad long laid claim to Oregon and in 1818 they had agreed to occupy the\r\nterritory jointly--a contract which was renewed ten years later for an\r\nindefinite period. Under this plan, citizens of both countries were free\r\nto hunt and settle anywhere in the region. The vanguard of British fur\r\ntraders and Canadian priests was enlarged by many new recruits, with\r\nAmericans not far behind them. John Jacob Astor, the resourceful New\r\nYork merchant, sent out trappers and hunters who established a trading\r\npost at Astoria in 1811. Some twenty years later, American\r\nmissionaries--among them two very remarkable men, Jason Lee and Marcus\r\nWhitman--were preaching the gospel to the Indians.\r\n\r\nThrough news from the fur traders and missionaries, Eastern farmers\r\nheard of the fertile lands awaiting their plows on the Pacific slope;\r\nthose with the pioneering spirit made ready to take possession of the\r\nnew country. In 1839 a band went around by Cape Horn. Four years later a\r\ngreat expedition went overland. The way once broken, others followed\r\nrapidly. As soon as a few settlements were well established, the\r\npioneers held a mass meeting and agreed upon a plan of government. \"We,\r\nthe people of Oregon territory,\" runs the preamble to their compact,\r\n\"for the purposes of mutual protection and to secure peace and\r\nprosperity among ourselves, agree to adopt the following laws and\r\nregulations until such time as the United States of America extend their\r\njurisdiction over us.\" Thus self-government made its way across the\r\nRocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OREGON COUNTRY AND THE DISPUTED BOUNDARY]\r\n\r\n_The Boundary Dispute with England Adjusted._--By this time it was\r\nevident that the boundaries of Oregon must be fixed. Having made the\r\nquestion an issue in his campaign, Polk, after his election in 1844,\r\npressed it upon the attention of the country. In his inaugural address\r\nand his first message to Congress he reiterated the claim of the\r\nDemocratic platform that \"our title to the whole territory of Oregon is\r\nclear and unquestionable.\" This pretension Great Britain firmly\r\nrejected, leaving the President a choice between war and compromise.\r\n\r\nPolk, already having the contest with Mexico on his hands, sought and\r\nobtained a compromise. The British government, moved by a hint from the\r\nAmerican minister, offered a settlement which would fix the boundary at\r\nthe forty-ninth parallel instead of \"fifty-four forty,\" and give it\r\nVancouver Island. Polk speedily chose this way out of the dilemma.\r\nInstead of making the decision himself, however, and drawing up a\r\ntreaty, he turned to the Senate for \"counsel.\" As prearranged with party\r\nleaders, the advice was favorable to the plan. The treaty, duly drawn in\r\n1846, was ratified by the Senate after an acrimonious debate. \"Oh!\r\nmountain that was delivered of a mouse,\" exclaimed Senator Benton, \"thy\r\nname shall be fifty-four forty!\" Thirteen years later, the southern part\r\nof the territory was admitted to the union as the state of Oregon,\r\nleaving the northern and eastern sections in the status of a territory.\r\n\r\n=California.=--With the growth of the northwestern empire, dedicated by\r\nnature to freedom, the planting interests might have been content, had\r\nfortune not wrested from them the fair country of California. Upon this\r\nhuge territory they had set their hearts. The mild climate and fertile\r\nsoil seemed well suited to slavery and the planters expected to extend\r\ntheir sway to the entire domain. California was a state of more than\r\n155,000 square miles--about seventy times the size of the state of\r\nDelaware. It could readily be divided into five or six large states, if\r\nthat became necessary to preserve the Southern balance of power.\r\n\r\n_Early American Relations with California._--Time and tide, it seems,\r\nwere not on the side of the planters. Already Americans of a far\r\ndifferent type were invading the Pacific slope. Long before Polk ever\r\ndreamed of California, the Yankee with his cargo of notions had been\r\naround the Horn. Daring skippers had sailed out of New England harbors\r\nwith a variety of goods, bent their course around South America to\r\nCalifornia, on to China and around the world, trading as they went and\r\nleaving pots, pans, woolen cloth, guns, boots, shoes, salt fish, naval\r\nstores, and rum in their wake. \"Home from Californy!\" rang the cry in\r\nmany a New England port as a good captain let go his anchor on his\r\nreturn from the long trading voyage in the Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OVERLAND TRAILS]\r\n\r\n_The Overland Trails._--Not to be outdone by the mariners of the deep,\r\nwestern scouts searched for overland routes to the Pacific. Zebulon\r\nPike, explorer and pathfinder, by his expedition into the Southwest\r\nduring Jefferson's administration, had discovered the resources of New\r\nSpain and had shown his countrymen how easy it was to reach Santa Fé\r\nfrom the upper waters of the Arkansas River. Not long afterward, traders\r\nlaid open the route, making Franklin, Missouri, and later Fort\r\nLeavenworth the starting point. Along the trail, once surveyed, poured\r\ncaravans heavily guarded by armed men against marauding Indians. Sand\r\nstorms often wiped out all signs of the route; hunger and thirst did\r\nmany a band of wagoners to death; but the lure of the game and the\r\nprofits at the end kept the business thriving. Huge stocks of cottons,\r\nglass, hardware, and ammunition were drawn almost across the continent\r\nto be exchanged at Santa Fé for furs, Indian blankets, silver, and\r\nmules; and many a fortune was made out of the traffic.\r\n\r\n_Americans in California._--Why stop at Santa Fé? The question did not\r\nlong remain unanswered. In 1829, Ewing Young broke the path to Los\r\nAngeles. Thirteen years later Frémont made the first of his celebrated\r\nexpeditions across plain, desert, and mountain, arousing the interest of\r\nthe entire country in the Far West. In the wake of the pathfinders went\r\nadventurers, settlers, and artisans. By 1847, more than one-fifth of the\r\ninhabitants in the little post of two thousand on San Francisco Bay were\r\nfrom the United States. The Mexican War, therefore, was not the\r\nbeginning but the end of the American conquest of California--a conquest\r\ninitiated by Americans who went to till the soil, to trade, or to follow\r\nsome mechanical pursuit.\r\n\r\n_The Discovery of Gold._--As if to clinch the hold on California already\r\nsecured by the friends of free soil, there came in 1848 the sudden\r\ndiscovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in the Sacramento Valley. When this\r\nexciting news reached the East, a mighty rush began to California, over\r\nthe trails, across the Isthmus of Panama, and around Cape Horn. Before\r\ntwo years had passed, it is estimated that a hundred thousand people, in\r\nsearch of fortunes, had arrived in California--mechanics, teachers,\r\ndoctors, lawyers, farmers, miners, and laborers from the four corners of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO IN 1849]\r\n\r\n_California a Free State._--With this increase in population there\r\nnaturally resulted the usual demand for admission to the union. Instead\r\nof waiting for authority from Washington, the Californians held a\r\nconvention in 1849 and framed their constitution. With impatience, the\r\ndelegates brushed aside the plea that \"the balance of power between the\r\nNorth and South\" required the admission of their state as a slave\r\ncommonwealth. Without a dissenting voice, they voted in favor of freedom\r\nand boldly made their request for inclusion among the United States.\r\nPresident Taylor, though a Southern man, advised Congress to admit the\r\napplicant. Robert Toombs of Georgia vowed to God that he preferred\r\nsecession. Henry Clay, the great compromiser, came to the rescue and in\r\n1850 California was admitted as a free state.\r\n\r\n=Utah.=--On the long road to California, in the midst of forbidding and\r\nbarren wastes, a religious sect, the Mormons, had planted a colony\r\ndestined to a stormy career. Founded in 1830 under the leadership of\r\nJoseph Smith of New York, the sect had suffered from many cruel buffets\r\nof fortune. From Ohio they had migrated into Missouri where they were\r\nset upon and beaten. Some of them were murdered by indignant neighbors.\r\nHarried out of Missouri, they went into Illinois only to see their\r\ndirector and prophet, Smith, first imprisoned by the authorities and\r\nthen shot by a mob. Having raised up a cloud of enemies on account of\r\nboth their religious faith and their practice of allowing a man to have\r\nmore than one wife, they fell in heartily with the suggestion of a new\r\nleader, Brigham Young, that they go into the Far West beyond the plains\r\nof Kansas--into the forlorn desert where the wicked would cease from\r\ntroubling and the weary could be at rest, as they read in the Bible. In\r\n1847, Young, with a company of picked men, searched far and wide until\r\nhe found a suitable spot overlooking the Salt Lake Valley. Returning to\r\nIllinois, he gathered up his followers, now numbering several thousand,\r\nand in one mighty wagon caravan they all went to their distant haven.\r\n\r\n_Brigham Young and His Economic System._--In Brigham Young the Mormons\r\nhad a leader of remarkable power who gave direction to the redemption of\r\nthe arid soil, the management of property, and the upbuilding of\r\nindustry. He promised them to make the desert blossom as the rose, and\r\nverily he did it. He firmly shaped the enterprise of the colony along\r\nco-operative lines, holding down the speculator and profiteer with one\r\nhand and giving encouragement to the industrious poor with the other.\r\nWith the shrewdness befitting a good business man, he knew how to draw\r\nthe line between public and private interest. Land was given outright to\r\neach family, but great care was exercised in the distribution so that\r\nnone should have great advantage over another. The purchase of supplies\r\nand the sale of produce were carried on through a coöperative store, the\r\nprofits of which went to the common good. Encountering for the first\r\ntime in the history of the Anglo-Saxon race the problem of aridity, the\r\nMormons surmounted the most perplexing obstacles with astounding skill.\r\nThey built irrigation works by coöperative labor and granted water\r\nrights to all families on equitable terms.\r\n\r\n_The Growth of Industries._--Though farming long remained the major\r\ninterest of the colony, the Mormons, eager to be self-supporting in\r\nevery possible way, bent their efforts also to manufacturing and later\r\nto mining. Their missionaries, who hunted in the highways and byways of\r\nEurope for converts, never failed to stress the economic advantages of\r\nthe sect. \"We want,\" proclaimed President Young to all the earth, \"a\r\ncompany of woolen manufacturers to come with machinery and take the wool\r\nfrom the sheep and convert it into the best clothes. We want a company\r\nof potters; we need them; the clay is ready and the dishes wanted.... We\r\nwant some men to start a furnace forthwith; the iron, coal, and molders\r\nare waiting.... We have a printing press and any one who can take good\r\nprinting and writing paper to the Valley will be a blessing to\r\nthemselves and the church.\" Roads and bridges were built; millions were\r\nspent in experiments in agriculture and manufacturing; missionaries at a\r\nhuge cost were maintained in the East and in Europe; an army was kept\r\nfor defense against the Indians; and colonies were planted in the\r\noutlying regions. A historian of Deseret, as the colony was called by\r\nthe Mormons, estimated in 1895 that by the labor of their hands the\r\npeople had produced nearly half a billion dollars in wealth since the\r\ncoming of the vanguard.\r\n\r\n_Polygamy Forbidden._--The hope of the Mormons that they might forever\r\nremain undisturbed by outsiders was soon dashed to earth, for hundreds\r\nof farmers and artisans belonging to other religious sects came to\r\nsettle among them. In 1850 the colony was so populous and prosperous\r\nthat it was organized into a territory of the United States and brought\r\nunder the supervision of the federal government. Protests against\r\npolygamy were raised in the colony and at the seat of authority three\r\nthousand miles away at Washington. The new Republican party in 1856\r\nproclaimed it \"the right and duty of Congress to prohibit in the\r\nTerritories those twin relics of barbarism, polygamy and slavery.\" In\r\ndue time the Mormons had to give up their marriage practices which were\r\ncondemned by the common opinion of all western civilization; but they\r\nkept their religious faith. Monuments to their early enterprise are seen\r\nin the Temple and the Tabernacle, the irrigation works, and the great\r\nwealth of the Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF WESTERN DEVELOPMENT AND NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\nWhile the statesmen of the old generation were solving the problems of\r\ntheir age, hunters, pioneers, and home seekers were preparing new\r\nproblems beyond the Alleghanies. The West was rising in population and\r\nwealth. Between 1783 and 1829, eleven states were added to the original\r\nthirteen. All but two were in the West. Two of them were in the\r\nLouisiana territory beyond the Mississippi. Here the process of\r\ncolonization was repeated. Hardy frontier people cut down the forests,\r\nbuilt log cabins, laid out farms, and cut roads through the wilderness.\r\nThey began a new civilization just as the immigrants to Virginia or\r\nMassachusetts had done two centuries earlier.\r\n\r\nLike the seaboard colonists before them, they too cherished the spirit\r\nof independence and power. They had not gone far upon their course\r\nbefore they resented the monopoly of the presidency by the East. In 1829\r\nthey actually sent one of their own cherished leaders, Andrew Jackson,\r\nto the White House. Again in 1840, in 1844, in 1848, and in 1860, the\r\nMississippi Valley could boast that one of its sons had been chosen for\r\nthe seat of power at Washington. Its democratic temper evoked a cordial\r\nresponse in the towns of the East where the old aristocracy had been put\r\naside and artisans had been given the ballot.\r\n\r\nFor three decades the West occupied the interest of the nation. Under\r\nJackson's leadership, it destroyed the second United States Bank. When\r\nhe smote nullification in South Carolina, it gave him cordial support.\r\nIt approved his policy of parceling out government offices among party\r\nworkers--\"the spoils system\" in all its fullness. On only one point did\r\nit really dissent. The West heartily favored internal improvements, the\r\nappropriation of federal funds for highways, canals, and railways.\r\nJackson had misgivings on this question and awakened sharp criticism by\r\nvetoing a road improvement bill.\r\n\r\nFrom their point of vantage on the frontier, the pioneers pressed on\r\nwestward. They pushed into Texas, created a state, declared their\r\nindependence, demanded a place in the union, and precipitated a war with\r\nMexico. They crossed the trackless plain and desert, laying out trails\r\nto Santa Fé, to Oregon, and to California. They were upon the scene when\r\nthe Mexican War brought California under the Stars and Stripes. They had\r\nlaid out their farms in the Willamette Valley when the slogan\r\n\"Fifty-Four Forty or Fight\" forced a settlement of the Oregon boundary.\r\nCalifornia and Oregon were already in the union when there arose the\r\nGreat Civil War testing whether this nation or any nation so conceived\r\nand so dedicated could long endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nG.P.

SECTIONAL CONFLICT AND RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Jefferson could have lived to see the Stars and Stripes planted on\r\nthe Pacific Coast, the broad empire of Texas added to the planting\r\nstates, and the valley of the Willamette waving with wheat sown by\r\nfarmers from New England, he would have been more than fortified in his\r\nfaith that the future of America lay in agriculture. Even a stanch old\r\nFederalist like Gouverneur Morris or Josiah Quincy would have mournfully\r\nconceded both the prophecy and the claim. Manifest destiny never seemed\r\nmore clearly written in the stars.\r\n\r\nAs the farmers from the Northwest and planters from the Southwest poured\r\nin upon the floor of Congress, the party of Jefferson, christened anew\r\nby Jackson, grew stronger year by year. Opponents there were, no doubt,\r\ndisgruntled critics and Whigs by conviction; but in 1852 Franklin\r\nPierce, the Democratic candidate for President, carried every state in\r\nthe union except Massachusetts, Vermont, Kentucky, and Tennessee. This\r\nvictory, a triumph under ordinary circumstances, was all the more\r\nsignificant in that Pierce was pitted against a hero of the Mexican War,\r\nGeneral Scott, whom the Whigs, hoping to win by rousing the martial\r\nardor of the voters, had nominated. On looking at the election returns,\r\nthe new President calmly assured the planters that \"the general\r\nprinciple of reduction of duties with a view to revenue may now be\r\nregarded as the settled policy of the country.\" With equal confidence,\r\nhe waved aside those agitators who devoted themselves \"to the supposed\r\ninterests of the relatively few Africans in the United States.\" Like a\r\nwatchman in the night he called to the country: \"All's well.\"\r\n\r\nThe party of Hamilton and Clay lay in the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nAs pride often goeth before a fall, so sanguine expectation is sometimes\r\nthe symbol of defeat. Jackson destroyed the bank. Polk signed the tariff\r\nbill of 1846 striking an effective blow at the principle of protection\r\nfor manufactures. Pierce promised to silence the abolitionists. His\r\nsuccessor was to approve a drastic step in the direction of free trade.\r\nNevertheless all these things left untouched the springs of power that\r\nwere in due time to make America the greatest industrial nation on the\r\nearth; namely, vast national resources, business enterprise, inventive\r\ngenius, and the free labor supply of Europe. Unseen by the thoughtless,\r\nunrecorded in the diaries of wiseacres, rarely mentioned in the speeches\r\nof statesmen, there was swiftly rising such a tide in the affairs of\r\nAmerica as Jefferson and Hamilton never dreamed of in their little\r\nphilosophies.\r\n\r\n=The Inventors.=--Watt and Boulton experimenting with steam in England,\r\nWhitney combining wood and steel into a cotton gin, Fulton and Fitch\r\napplying the steam engine to navigation, Stevens and Peter Cooper trying\r\nout the \"iron horse\" on \"iron highways,\" Slater building spinning mills\r\nin Pawtucket, Howe attaching the needle to the flying wheel, Morse\r\nspanning a continent with the telegraph, Cyrus Field linking the markets\r\nof the new world with the old along the bed of the Atlantic, McCormick\r\nbreaking the sickle under the reaper--these men and a thousand more were\r\ndestroying in a mighty revolution of industry the world of the\r\nstagecoach and the tallow candle which Washington and Franklin had\r\ninherited little changed from the age of Cæsar. Whitney was to make\r\ncotton king. Watt and Fulton were to make steel and steam masters of the\r\nworld. Agriculture was to fall behind in the race for supremacy.\r\n\r\n=Industry Outstrips Planting.=--The story of invention, that tribute to\r\nthe triumph of mind over matter, fascinating as a romance, need not be\r\ntreated in detail here. The effects of invention on social and political\r\nlife, multitudinous and never-ending, form the very warp and woof of\r\nAmerican progress from the days of Andrew Jackson to the latest hour.\r\nNeither the great civil conflict--the clash of two systems--nor the\r\nproblems of the modern age can be approached without an understanding of\r\nthe striking phases of industrialism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A NEW ENGLAND MILL BUILT IN 1793]\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost among them was the uprush of mills managed by\r\ncaptains of industry and manned by labor drawn from farms, cities, and\r\nforeign lands. For every planter who cleared a domain in the Southwest\r\nand gathered his army of bondmen about him, there rose in the North a\r\nmagician of steam and steel who collected under his roof an army of free\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nIn seven league boots this new giant strode ahead of the Southern giant.\r\nBetween 1850 and 1859, to use dollars and cents as the measure of\r\nprogress, the value of domestic manufactures including mines and\r\nfisheries rose from $1,019,106,616 to $1,900,000,000, an increase of\r\neighty-six per cent in ten years. In this same period the total\r\nproduction of naval stores, rice, sugar, tobacco, and cotton, the\r\nstaples of the South, went only from $165,000,000, in round figures, to\r\n$204,000,000. At the halfway point of the century, the capital invested\r\nin industry, commerce, and cities far exceeded the value of all the farm\r\nland between the Atlantic and the Pacific; thus the course of economy\r\nhad been reversed in fifty years. Tested by figures of production, King\r\nCotton had shriveled by 1860 to a petty prince in comparison, for each\r\nyear the captains of industry turned out goods worth nearly twenty times\r\nall the bales of cotton picked on Southern plantations. Iron, boots and\r\nshoes, and leather goods pouring from Northern mills surpassed in value\r\nthe entire cotton output.\r\n\r\n=The Agrarian West Turns to Industry.=--Nor was this vast enterprise\r\nconfined to the old Northeast where, as Madison had sagely remarked,\r\ncommerce was early dominant. \"Cincinnati,\" runs an official report in\r\n1854, \"appears to be a great central depot for ready-made clothing and\r\nits manufacture for the Western markets may be said to be one of the\r\ngreat trades of that city.\" There, wrote another traveler, \"I heard the\r\ncrack of the cattle driver's whip and the hum of the factory: the West\r\nand the East meeting.\" Louisville and St. Louis were already famous for\r\ntheir clothing trades and the manufacture of cotton bagging. Five\r\nhundred of the two thousand woolen mills in the country in 1860 were in\r\nthe Western states. Of the output of flour and grist mills, which almost\r\nreached in value the cotton crop of 1850, the Ohio Valley furnished a\r\nrapidly growing share. The old home of Jacksonian democracy, where\r\nFederalists had been almost as scarce as monarchists, turned slowly\r\nbackward, as the needle to the pole, toward the principle of protection\r\nfor domestic industry, espoused by Hamilton and defended by Clay.\r\n\r\n=The Extension of Canals and Railways.=--As necessary to mechanical\r\nindustry as steel and steam power was the great market, spread over a\r\nwide and diversified area and knit together by efficient means of\r\ntransportation. This service was supplied to industry by the steamship,\r\nwhich began its career on the Hudson in 1807; by the canals, of which\r\nthe Erie opened in 1825 was the most noteworthy; and by the railways,\r\nwhich came into practical operation about 1830.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nAN EARLY RAILWAY]\r\n\r\nWith sure instinct the Eastern manufacturer reached out for the markets\r\nof the Northwest territory where free farmers were producing annually\r\nstaggering crops of corn, wheat, bacon, and wool. The two great canal\r\nsystems--the Erie connecting New York City with the waterways of the\r\nGreat Lakes and the Pennsylvania chain linking Philadelphia with the\r\nheadwaters of the Ohio--gradually turned the tide of trade from New\r\nOrleans to the Eastern seaboard. The railways followed the same paths.\r\nBy 1860, New York had rail connections with Chicago and St. Louis, one\r\nof the routes running through the Hudson and Mohawk valleys and along\r\nthe Great Lakes, the other through Philadelphia and Pennsylvania and\r\nacross the rich wheat fields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Baltimore,\r\nnot to be outdone by her two rivals, reached out over the mountains for\r\nthe Western trade and in 1857 had trains running into St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIn railway enterprise the South took more interest than in canals, and\r\nthe friends of that section came to its aid. To offset the magnet\r\ndrawing trade away from the Mississippi Valley, lines were built from\r\nthe Gulf to Chicago, the Illinois Central part of the project being a\r\nmonument to the zeal and industry of a Democrat, better known in\r\npolitics than in business, Stephen A. Douglas. The swift movement of\r\ncotton and tobacco to the North or to seaports was of common concern to\r\nplanters and manufacturers. Accordingly lines were flung down along the\r\nSouthern coast, linking Richmond, Charleston, and Savannah with the\r\nNorthern markets. Other lines struck inland from the coast, giving a\r\nrail outlet to the sea for Raleigh, Columbia, Atlanta, Chattanooga,\r\nNashville, and Montgomery. Nevertheless, in spite of this enterprise,\r\nthe mileage of all the Southern states in 1860 did not equal that of\r\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois combined.\r\n\r\n=Banking and Finance.=--Out of commerce and manufactures and the\r\nconstruction and operation of railways came such an accumulation of\r\ncapital in the Northern states as merchants of old never imagined. The\r\nbanks of the four industrial states of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New\r\nYork, and Pennsylvania in 1860 had funds greater than the banks in all\r\nthe other states combined. New York City had become the money market of\r\nAmerica, the center to which industrial companies, railway promoters,\r\nfarmers, and planters turned for capital to initiate and carry on their\r\noperations. The banks of Louisiana, South Carolina, Georgia, and\r\nVirginia, it is true, had capital far in excess of the banks of the\r\nNorthwest; but still they were relatively small compared with the\r\nfinancial institutions of the East.\r\n\r\n=The Growth of the Industrial Population.=--A revolution of such\r\nmagnitude in industry, transport, and finance, overturning as it did the\r\nagrarian civilization of the old Northwest and reaching out to the very\r\nborders of the country, could not fail to bring in its train\r\nconsequences of a striking character. Some were immediate and obvious.\r\nOthers require a fullness of time not yet reached to reveal their\r\ncomplete significance. Outstanding among them was the growth of an\r\nindustrial population, detached from the land, concentrated in cities,\r\nand, to use Jefferson's phrase, dependent upon \"the caprices and\r\ncasualties of trade\" for a livelihood. This was a result, as the great\r\nVirginian had foreseen, which flowed inevitably from public and private\r\nefforts to stimulate industry as against agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOWELL, MASSACHUSETTS, IN 1838, AN EARLY INDUSTRIAL\r\nTOWN]\r\n\r\nIt was estimated in 1860, on the basis of the census figures, that\r\nmechanical production gave employment to 1,100,000 men and 285,000\r\nwomen, making, if the average number of dependents upon them be\r\nreckoned, nearly six million people or about one-sixth of the population\r\nof the country sustained from manufactures. \"This,\" runs the official\r\nrecord, \"was exclusive of the number engaged in the production of many\r\nof the raw materials and of the food for manufacturers; in the\r\ndistribution of their products, such as merchants, clerks, draymen,\r\nmariners, the employees of railroads, expresses, and steamboats; of\r\ncapitalists, various artistic and professional classes, as well as\r\ncarpenters, bricklayers, painters, and the members of other mechanical\r\ntrades not classed as manufactures. It is safe to assume, then, that\r\none-third of the whole population is supported, directly, or indirectly,\r\nby manufacturing industry.\" Taking, however, the number of persons\r\ndirectly supported by manufactures, namely about six millions, reveals\r\nthe astounding fact that the white laboring population, divorced from\r\nthe soil, already exceeded the number of slaves on Southern farms and\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\n_Immigration._--The more carefully the rapid growth of the industrial\r\npopulation is examined, the more surprising is the fact that such an\r\nimmense body of free laborers could be found, particularly when it is\r\nrecalled to what desperate straits the colonial leaders were put in\r\nsecuring immigrants,--slavery, indentured servitude, and kidnapping\r\nbeing the fruits of their necessities. The answer to the enigma is to be\r\nfound partly in European conditions and partly in the cheapness of\r\ntransportation after the opening of the era of steam navigation. Shrewd\r\nobservers of the course of events had long foreseen that a flood of\r\ncheap labor was bound to come when the way was made easy. Some, among\r\nthem Chief Justice Ellsworth, went so far as to prophesy that white\r\nlabor would in time be so abundant that slavery would disappear as the\r\nmore costly of the two labor systems. The processes of nature were aided\r\nby the policies of government in England and Germany.\r\n\r\n_The Coming of the Irish._--The opposition of the Irish people to the\r\nEnglish government, ever furious and irrepressible, was increased in the\r\nmid forties by an almost total failure of the potato crop, the main\r\nsupport of the peasants. Catholic in religion, they had been compelled\r\nto support a Protestant church. Tillers of the soil by necessity, they\r\nwere forced to pay enormous tributes to absentee landlords in England\r\nwhose claim to their estates rested upon the title of conquest and\r\nconfiscation. Intensely loyal to their race, the Irish were subjected in\r\nall things to the Parliament at London, in which their small minority of\r\nrepresentatives had little influence save in holding a balance of power\r\nbetween the two contending English parties. To the constant political\r\nirritation, the potato famine added physical distress beyond\r\ndescription. In cottages and fields and along the highways the victims\r\nof starvation lay dead by the hundreds, the relief which charity\r\nafforded only bringing misery more sharply to the foreground. Those who\r\nwere fortunate enough to secure passage money sought escape to America.\r\nIn 1844 the total immigration into the United States was less than\r\neighty thousand; in 1850 it had risen by leaps and bounds to more than\r\nthree hundred thousand. Between 1820 and 1860 the immigrants from the\r\nUnited Kingdom numbered 2,750,000, of whom more than one-half were\r\nIrish. It has been said with a touch of exaggeration that the American\r\ncanals and railways of those days were built by the labor of Irishmen.\r\n\r\n_The German Migration._--To political discontent and economic distress,\r\nsuch as was responsible for the coming of the Irish, may likewise be\r\ntraced the source of the Germanic migration. The potato blight that fell\r\nupon Ireland visited the Rhine Valley and Southern Germany at the same\r\ntime with results as pitiful, if less extensive. The calamity inflicted\r\nby nature was followed shortly by another inflicted by the despotic\r\nconduct of German kings and princes. In 1848 there had occurred\r\nthroughout Europe a popular uprising in behalf of republics and\r\ndemocratic government. For a time it rode on a full tide of success.\r\nKings were overthrown, or compelled to promise constitutional\r\ngovernment, and tyrannical ministers fled from their palaces. Then came\r\nreaction. Those who had championed the popular cause were imprisoned,\r\nshot, or driven out of the land. Men of attainments and distinction,\r\nwhose sole offense was opposition to the government of kings and\r\nprinces, sought an asylum in America, carrying with them to the land of\r\ntheir adoption the spirit of liberty and democracy. In 1847 over fifty\r\nthousand Germans came to America, the forerunners of a migration that\r\nincreased, almost steadily, for many years. The record of 1860 showed\r\nthat in the previous twenty years nearly a million and a half had found\r\nhomes in the United States. Far and wide they scattered, from the mills\r\nand shops of the seacoast towns to the uttermost frontiers of Wisconsin\r\nand Minnesota.\r\n\r\n_The Labor of Women and Children._--If the industries, canals, and\r\nrailways of the country were largely manned by foreign labor, still\r\nimportant native sources must not be overlooked; above all, the women\r\nand children of the New England textile districts. Spinning and weaving,\r\nby a tradition that runs far beyond the written records of mankind,\r\nbelonged to women. Indeed it was the dexterous housewives, spinsters,\r\nand boys and girls that laid the foundations of the textile industry in\r\nAmerica, foundations upon which the mechanical revolution was built. As\r\nthe wheel and loom were taken out of the homes to the factories operated\r\nby water power or the steam engine, the women and, to use Hamilton's\r\nphrase, \"the children of tender years,\" followed as a matter of course.\r\n\"The cotton manufacture alone employs six thousand persons in Lowell,\"\r\nwrote a French observer in 1836; \"of this number nearly five thousand\r\nare young women from seventeen to twenty-four years of age, the\r\ndaughters of farmers from the different New England states.\" It was not\r\nuntil after the middle of the century that foreign lands proved to be\r\nthe chief source from which workers were recruited for the factories of\r\nNew England. It was then that the daughters of the Puritans, outdone by\r\nthe competition of foreign labor, both of men and women, left the\r\nspinning jenny and the loom to other hands.\r\n\r\n=The Rise of Organized Labor.=--The changing conditions of American\r\nlife, marked by the spreading mill towns of New England, New York, and\r\nPennsylvania and the growth of cities like Buffalo, Cincinnati,\r\nLouisville, St. Louis, Detroit, and Chicago in the West, naturally\r\nbrought changes, as Jefferson had prophesied, in \"manners and morals.\" A\r\nfew mechanics, smiths, carpenters, and masons, widely scattered through\r\nfarming regions and rural villages, raise no such problems as tens of\r\nthousands of workers collected in one center in daily intercourse,\r\nlearning the power of coöperation and union.\r\n\r\nEven before the coming of steam and machinery, in the \"good old days\" of\r\nhandicrafts, laborers in many trades--printers, shoemakers, carpenters,\r\nfor example--had begun to draw together in the towns for the advancement\r\nof their interests in the form of higher wages, shorter days, and\r\nmilder laws. The shoemakers of Philadelphia, organized in 1794,\r\nconducted a strike in 1799 and held together until indicted seven years\r\nlater for conspiracy. During the twenties and thirties, local labor\r\nunions sprang up in all industrial centers and they led almost\r\nimmediately to city federations of the several crafts.\r\n\r\nAs the thousands who were dependent upon their daily labor for their\r\nlivelihood mounted into the millions and industries spread across the\r\ncontinent, the local unions of craftsmen grew into national craft\r\norganizations bound together by the newspapers, the telegraph, and the\r\nrailways. Before 1860 there were several such national trade unions,\r\nincluding the plumbers, printers, mule spinners, iron molders, and stone\r\ncutters. All over the North labor leaders arose--men unknown to general\r\nhistory but forceful and resourceful characters who forged links binding\r\nscattered and individual workers into a common brotherhood. An attempt\r\nwas even made in 1834 to federate all the crafts into a permanent\r\nnational organization; but it perished within three years through lack\r\nof support. Half a century had to elapse before the American Federation\r\nof Labor was to accomplish this task.\r\n\r\nAll the manifestations of the modern labor movement had appeared, in\r\ngerm at least, by the time the mid-century was reached: unions, labor\r\nleaders, strikes, a labor press, a labor political program, and a labor\r\npolitical party. In every great city industrial disputes were a common\r\noccurrence. The papers recorded about four hundred in two years,\r\n1853-54, local affairs but forecasting economic struggles in a larger\r\nfield. The labor press seems to have begun with the founding of the\r\n_Mechanics' Free Press_ in Philadelphia in 1828 and the establishment of\r\nthe New York _Workingman's Advocate_ shortly afterward. These\r\nsemi-political papers were in later years followed by regular trade\r\npapers designed to weld together and advance the interests of particular\r\ncrafts. Edited by able leaders, these little sheets with limited\r\ncirculation wielded an enormous influence in the ranks of the workers.\r\n\r\n=Labor and Politics.=--As for the political program of labor, the main\r\nplanks were clear and specific: the abolition of imprisonment for debt,\r\nmanhood suffrage in states where property qualifications still\r\nprevailed, free and universal education, laws protecting the safety and\r\nhealth of workers in mills and factories, abolition of lotteries, repeal\r\nof laws requiring militia service, and free land in the West.\r\n\r\nInto the labor papers and platforms there sometimes crept a note of\r\nhostility to the masters of industry, a sign of bitterness that excited\r\nlittle alarm while cheap land in the West was open to the discontented.\r\nThe Philadelphia workmen, in issuing a call for a local convention,\r\ninvited \"all those of our fellow citizens who live by their own labor\r\nand none other.\" In Newcastle county, Delaware, the association of\r\nworking people complained in 1830: \"The poor have no laws; the laws are\r\nmade by the rich and of course for the rich.\" Here and there an\r\nextremist went to the length of advocating an equal division of wealth\r\namong all the people--the crudest kind of communism.\r\n\r\nAgitation of this character produced in labor circles profound distrust\r\nof both Whigs and Democrats who talked principally about tariffs and\r\nbanks; it resulted in attempts to found independent labor parties. In\r\nPhiladelphia, Albany, New York City, and New England, labor candidates\r\nwere put up for elections in the early thirties and in a few cases were\r\nvictorious at the polls. \"The balance of power has at length got into\r\nthe hands of the working people, where it properly belongs,\"\r\ntriumphantly exclaimed the _Mechanics' Free Press_ of Philadelphia in\r\n1829. But the triumph was illusory. Dissensions appeared in the labor\r\nranks. The old party leaders, particularly of Tammany Hall, the\r\nDemocratic party organization in New York City, offered concessions to\r\nlabor in return for votes. Newspapers unsparingly denounced \"trade union\r\npoliticians\" as \"demagogues,\" \"levellers,\" and \"rag, tag, and bobtail\";\r\nand some of them, deeming labor unrest the sour fruit of manhood\r\nsuffrage, suggested disfranchisement as a remedy. Under the influence\r\nof concessions and attacks the political fever quickly died away, and\r\nthe end of the decade left no remnant of the labor political parties.\r\nLabor leaders turned to a task which seemed more substantial and\r\npractical, that of organizing workingmen into craft unions for the\r\ndefinite purpose of raising wages and reducing hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION AND NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n=Southern Plans for Union with the West.=--It was long the design of\r\nSouthern statesmen like Calhoun to hold the West and the South together\r\nin one political party. The theory on which they based their hope was\r\nsimple. Both sections were agricultural--the producers of raw materials\r\nand the buyers of manufactured goods. The planters were heavy purchasers\r\nof Western bacon, pork, mules, and grain. The Mississippi River and its\r\ntributaries formed the natural channel for the transportation of heavy\r\nproduce southward to the plantations and outward to Europe. Therefore,\r\nran their political reasoning, the interests of the two sections were\r\none. By standing together in favor of low tariffs, they could buy their\r\nmanufactures cheaply in Europe and pay for them in cotton, tobacco, and\r\ngrain. The union of the two sections under Jackson's management seemed\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n=The East Forms Ties with the West.=--Eastern leaders were not blind to\r\nthe ambitions of Southern statesmen. On the contrary, they also\r\nrecognized the importance of forming strong ties with the agrarian West\r\nand drawing the produce of the Ohio Valley to Philadelphia and New York.\r\nThe canals and railways were the physical signs of this economic union,\r\nand the results, commercial and political, were soon evident. By the\r\nmiddle of the century, Southern economists noted the change, one of\r\nthem, De Bow, lamenting that \"the great cities of the North have\r\nseverally penetrated the interior with artificial lines until they have\r\ntaken from the open and untaxed current of the Mississippi the commerce\r\nproduced on its borders.\" To this writer it was an astounding thing to\r\nbehold \"the number of steamers that now descend the upper Mississippi\r\nRiver, loaded to the guards with produce, as far as the mouth of the\r\nIllinois River and then turn up that stream with their cargoes to be\r\nshipped to New York _via_ Chicago. The Illinois canal has not only swept\r\nthe whole produce along the line of the Illinois River to the East, but\r\nit is drawing the products of the upper Mississippi through the same\r\nchannel; thus depriving New Orleans and St. Louis of a rich portion of\r\ntheir former trade.\"\r\n\r\nIf to any shippers the broad current of the great river sweeping down to\r\nNew Orleans offered easier means of physical communication to the sea\r\nthan the canals and railways, the difference could be overcome by the\r\ncredit which Eastern bankers were able to extend to the grain and\r\nproduce buyers, in the first instance, and through them to the farmers\r\non the soil. The acute Southern observer just quoted, De Bow, admitted\r\nwith evident regret, in 1852, that \"last autumn, the rich regions of\r\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois were flooded with the local bank notes of\r\nthe Eastern States, advanced by the New York houses on produce to be\r\nshipped by way of the canals in the spring.... These moneyed facilities\r\nenable the packer, miller, and speculator to hold on to their produce\r\nuntil the opening of navigation in the spring and they are no longer\r\nobliged, as formerly, to hurry off their shipments during the winter by\r\nthe way of New Orleans in order to realize funds by drafts on their\r\nshipments. The banking facilities at the East are doing as much to draw\r\ntrade from us as the canals and railways which Eastern capital is\r\nconstructing.\" Thus canals, railways, and financial credit were swiftly\r\nforging bonds of union between the old home of Jacksonian Democracy in\r\nthe West and the older home of Federalism in the East. The nationalism\r\nto which Webster paid eloquent tribute became more and more real with\r\nthe passing of time. The self-sufficiency of the pioneer was broken down\r\nas he began to watch the produce markets of New York and Philadelphia\r\nwhere the prices of corn and hogs fixed his earnings for the year.\r\n\r\n=The West and Manufactures.=--In addition to the commercial bonds\r\nbetween the East and the West there was growing up a common interest in\r\nmanufactures. As skilled white labor increased in the Ohio Valley, the\r\nindustries springing up in the new cities made Western life more like\r\nthat of the industrial East than like that of the planting South.\r\nMoreover, the Western states produced some important raw materials for\r\nAmerican factories, which called for protection against foreign\r\ncompetition, notably, wool, hemp, and flax. As the South had little or\r\nno foreign competition in cotton and tobacco, the East could not offer\r\nprotection for her raw materials in exchange for protection for\r\nindustries. With the West, however, it became possible to establish\r\nreciprocity in tariffs; that is, for example, to trade a high rate on\r\nwool for a high rate on textiles or iron.\r\n\r\n=The South Dependent on the North.=--While East and West were drawing\r\ntogether, the distinctions between North and South were becoming more\r\nmarked; the latter, having few industries and producing little save raw\r\nmaterials, was being forced into the position of a dependent section. As\r\na result of the protective tariff, Southern planters were compelled to\r\nturn more and more to Northern mills for their cloth, shoes, hats, hoes,\r\nplows, and machinery. Nearly all the goods which they bought in Europe\r\nin exchange for their produce came overseas to Northern ports, whence\r\ntransshipments were made by rail and water to Southern points of\r\ndistribution. Their rice, cotton, and tobacco, in as far as they were\r\nnot carried to Europe in British bottoms, were transported by Northern\r\nmasters. In these ways, a large part of the financial operations\r\nconnected with the sale of Southern produce and the purchase of goods in\r\nexchange passed into the hands of Northern merchants and bankers who,\r\nnaturally, made profits from their transactions. Finally, Southern\r\nplanters who wanted to buy more land and more slaves on credit borrowed\r\nheavily in the North where huge accumulations made the rates of interest\r\nlower than the smaller banks of the South could afford.\r\n\r\n=The South Reckons the Cost of Economic Dependence.=--As Southern\r\ndependence upon Northern capital became more and more marked, Southern\r\nleaders began to chafe at what they regarded as restraints laid upon\r\ntheir enterprise. In a word, they came to look upon the planter as a\r\ntribute-bearer to the manufacturer and financier. \"The South,\"\r\nexpostulated De Bow, \"stands in the attitude of feeding ... a vast\r\npopulation of [Northern] merchants, shipowners, capitalists, and others\r\nwho, without claims on her progeny, drink up the life blood of her\r\ntrade.... Where goes the value of our labor but to those who, taking\r\nadvantage of our folly, ship for us, buy for us, sell to us, and, after\r\nturning our own capital to their profitable account, return laden with\r\nour money to enjoy their easily earned opulence at home.\"\r\n\r\nSouthern statisticians, not satisfied with generalities, attempted to\r\nfigure out how great was this tribute in dollars and cents. They\r\nestimated that the planters annually lent to Northern merchants the full\r\nvalue of their exports, a hundred millions or more, \"to be used in the\r\nmanipulation of foreign imports.\" They calculated that no less than\r\nforty millions all told had been paid to shipowners in profits. They\r\nreckoned that, if the South were to work up her own cotton, she would\r\nrealize from seventy to one hundred millions a year that otherwise went\r\nNorth. Finally, to cap the climax, they regretted that planters spent\r\nsome fifteen millions a year pleasure-seeking in the alluring cities and\r\nsummer resorts of the North.\r\n\r\n=Southern Opposition to Northern Policies.=--Proceeding from these\r\npremises, Southern leaders drew the logical conclusion that the entire\r\nprogram of economic measures demanded in the North was without exception\r\nadverse to Southern interests and, by a similar chain of reasoning,\r\ninjurious to the corn and wheat producers of the West. Cheap labor\r\nafforded by free immigration, a protective tariff raising prices of\r\nmanufactures for the tiller of the soil, ship subsidies increasing the\r\ntonnage of carrying trade in Northern hands, internal improvements\r\nforging new economic bonds between the East and the West, a national\r\nbanking system giving strict national control over the currency as a\r\nsafeguard against paper inflation--all these devices were regarded in\r\nthe South as contrary to the planting interest. They were constantly\r\ncompared with the restrictive measures by which Great Britain more than\r\nhalf a century before had sought to bind American interests.\r\n\r\nAs oppression justified a war for independence once, statesmen argued,\r\nso it can justify it again. \"It is curious as it is melancholy and\r\ndistressing,\" came a broad hint from South Carolina, \"to see how\r\nstriking is the analogy between the colonial vassalage to which the\r\nmanufacturing states have reduced the planting states and that which\r\nformerly bound the Anglo-American colonies to the British empire....\r\nEngland said to her American colonies: 'You shall not trade with the\r\nrest of the world for such manufactures as are produced in the mother\r\ncountry.' The manufacturing states say to their Southern colonies: 'You\r\nshall not trade with the rest of the world for such manufactures as we\r\nproduce.'\" The conclusion was inexorable: either the South must control\r\nthe national government and its economic measures, or it must declare,\r\nas America had done four score years before, its political and economic\r\nindependence. As Northern mills multiplied, as railways spun their\r\nmighty web over the face of the North, and as accumulated capital rose\r\ninto the hundreds of millions, the conviction of the planters and their\r\nstatesmen deepened into desperation.\r\n\r\n=Efforts to Start Southern Industries Fail.=--A few of them, seeing the\r\npredominance of the North, made determined efforts to introduce\r\nmanufactures into the South. To the leaders who were averse to secession\r\nand nullification this seemed the only remedy for the growing disparity\r\nin the power of the two sections. Societies for the encouragement of\r\nmechanical industries were formed, the investment of capital was sought,\r\nand indeed a few mills were built on Southern soil. The results were\r\nmeager. The natural resources, coal and water power, were abundant; but\r\nthe enterprise for direction and the skilled labor were wanting. The\r\nstream of European immigration flowed North and West, not South. The\r\nIrish or German laborer, even if he finally made his home in a city, had\r\nbefore him, while in the North, the alternative of a homestead on\r\nWestern land. To him slavery was a strange, if not a repelling,\r\ninstitution. He did not take to it kindly nor care to fix his home where\r\nit flourished. While slavery lasted, the economy of the South was\r\ninevitably agricultural. While agriculture predominated, leadership with\r\nequal necessity fell to the planting interest. While the planting\r\ninterest ruled, political opposition to Northern economy was destined to\r\ngrow in strength.\r\n\r\n=The Southern Theory of Sectionalism.=--In the opinion of the statesmen\r\nwho frankly represented the planting interest, the industrial system was\r\nits deadly enemy. Their entire philosophy of American politics was\r\nsummed up in a single paragraph by McDuffie, a spokesman for South\r\nCarolina: \"Owing to the federative character of our government, the\r\ngreat geographical extent of our territory, and the diversity of the\r\npursuits of our citizens in different parts of the union, it has so\r\nhappened that two great interests have sprung up, standing directly\r\nopposed to each other. One of these consists of those manufactures which\r\nthe Northern and Middle states are capable of producing but which, owing\r\nto the high price of labor and the high profits of capital in those\r\nstates, cannot hold competition with foreign manufactures without the\r\naid of bounties, directly or indirectly given, either by the general\r\ngovernment or by the state governments. The other of these interests\r\nconsists of the great agricultural staples of the Southern states which\r\ncan find a market only in foreign countries and which can be\r\nadvantageously sold only in exchange for foreign manufactures which come\r\nin competition with those of the Northern and Middle states.... These\r\ninterests then stand diametrically and irreconcilably opposed to each\r\nother. The interest, the pecuniary interest of the Northern\r\nmanufacturer, is directly promoted by every increase of the taxes\r\nimposed upon Southern commerce; and it is unnecessary to add that the\r\ninterest of the Southern planter is promoted by every diminution of\r\ntaxes imposed upon the productions of their industry. If, under these\r\ncircumstances, the manufacturers were clothed with the power of imposing\r\ntaxes, at their pleasure, upon the foreign imports of the planter, no\r\ndoubt would exist in the mind of any man that it would have all the\r\ncharacteristics of an absolute and unqualified despotism.\" The economic\r\nsoundness of this reasoning, a subject of interesting speculation for\r\nthe economist, is of little concern to the historian. The historical\r\npoint is that this opinion was widely held in the South and with the\r\nprogress of time became the prevailing doctrine of the planting\r\nstatesmen.\r\n\r\nTheir antagonism was deepened because they also became convinced, on\r\nwhat grounds it is not necessary to inquire, that the leaders of the\r\nindustrial interest thus opposed to planting formed a consolidated\r\n\"aristocracy of wealth,\" bent upon the pursuit and attainment of\r\npolitical power at Washington. \"By the aid of various associated\r\ninterests,\" continued McDuffie, \"the manufacturing capitalists have\r\nobtained a complete and permanent control over the legislation of\r\nCongress on this subject [the tariff].... Men confederated together upon\r\nselfish and interested principles, whether in pursuit of the offices or\r\nthe bounties of the government, are ever more active and vigilant than\r\nthe great majority who act from disinterested and patriotic impulses.\r\nHave we not witnessed it on this floor, sir? Who ever knew the tariff\r\nmen to divide on any question affecting their confederated interests?...\r\nThe watchword is, stick together, right or wrong upon every question\r\naffecting the common cause. Such, sir, is the concert and vigilance and\r\nsuch the combinations by which the manufacturing party, acting upon the\r\ninterests of some and the prejudices of others, have obtained a decided\r\nand permanent control over public opinion in all the tariff states.\"\r\nThus, as the Southern statesman would have it, the North, in matters\r\naffecting national policies, was ruled by a \"confederated interest\"\r\nwhich menaced the planting interest. As the former grew in magnitude and\r\nattached to itself the free farmers of the West through channels of\r\ntrade and credit, it followed as night the day that in time the planters\r\nwould be overshadowed and at length overborne in the struggle of giants.\r\nWhether the theory was sound or not, Southern statesmen believed it and\r\nacted upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nM.

From\r\nthe inauguration of Washington to the election of Lincoln the sectional\r\nconflict, discerned by this penetrating thinker, exercised a profound\r\ninfluence on the course of American politics. It was latent during the\r\n\"era of good feeling\" when the Jeffersonian Republicans adopted\r\nFederalist policies; it flamed up in the contest between the Democrats\r\nand Whigs. Finally it raged in the angry political quarrel which\r\nculminated in the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY--NORTH AND SOUTH\r\n\r\n=The Decline of Slavery in the North.=--At the time of the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution, slavery was lawful in all the Northern states except\r\nMassachusetts. There were almost as many bondmen in New York as in\r\nGeorgia. New Jersey had more than Delaware or Tennessee, indeed nearly\r\nas many as both combined. All told, however, there were only about forty\r\nthousand in the North as against nearly seven hundred thousand in the\r\nSouth. Moreover, most of the Northern slaves were domestic servants, not\r\nlaborers necessary to keep mills going or fields under cultivation.\r\n\r\nThere was, in the North, a steadily growing moral sentiment against the\r\nsystem. Massachusetts abandoned it in 1780. In the same year,\r\nPennsylvania provided for gradual emancipation. New Hampshire, where\r\nthere had been only a handful, Connecticut with a few thousand\r\ndomestics, and New Jersey early followed these examples. New York, in\r\n1799, declared that all children born of slaves after July 4 of that\r\nyear should be free, though held for a term as apprentices; and in 1827\r\nit swept away the last vestiges of slavery. So with the passing of the\r\ngeneration that had framed the Constitution, chattel servitude\r\ndisappeared in the commercial states, leaving behind only such\r\ndiscriminations as disfranchisement or high property qualifications on\r\ncolored voters.\r\n\r\n=The Growth of Northern Sentiment against Slavery.=--In both sections of\r\nthe country there early existed, among those more or less\r\nphilosophically inclined, a strong opposition to slavery on moral as\r\nwell as economic grounds. In the constitutional convention of 1787,\r\nGouverneur Morris had vigorously condemned it and proposed that the\r\nwhole country should bear the cost of abolishing it. About the same time\r\na society for promoting the abolition of slavery, under the presidency\r\nof Benjamin Franklin, laid before Congress a petition that serious\r\nattention be given to the emancipation of \"those unhappy men who alone\r\nin this land of freedom are degraded into perpetual bondage.\" When\r\nCongress, acting on the recommendations of President Jefferson, provided\r\nfor the abolition of the foreign slave trade on January 1, 1808, several\r\nNorthern members joined with Southern members in condemning the system\r\nas well as the trade. Later, colonization societies were formed to\r\nencourage the emancipation of slaves and their return to Africa. James\r\nMadison was president and Henry Clay vice president of such an\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery sentiment of which these were the signs was\r\nnevertheless confined to narrow circles and bore no trace of bitterness.\r\n\"We consider slavery your calamity, not your crime,\" wrote a\r\ndistinguished Boston clergyman to his Southern brethren, \"and we will\r\nshare with you the burden of putting an end to it. We will consent that\r\nthe public lands shall be appropriated to this object.... I deprecate\r\neverything which sows discord and exasperating sectional animosities.\"\r\n\r\n=Uncompromising Abolition.=--In a little while the spirit of generosity\r\nwas gone. Just as Jacksonian Democracy rose to power there appeared a\r\nnew kind of anti-slavery doctrine--the dogmatism of the abolition\r\nagitator. For mild speculation on the evils of the system was\r\nsubstituted an imperious and belligerent demand for instant\r\nemancipation. If a date must be fixed for its appearance, the year 1831\r\nmay be taken when William Lloyd Garrison founded in Boston his\r\nanti-slavery paper, _The Liberator_. With singleness of purpose and\r\nutter contempt for all opposing opinions and arguments, he pursued his\r\ncourse of passionate denunciation. He apologized for having ever\r\n\"assented to the popular but pernicious doctrine of gradual abolition.\"\r\nHe chose for his motto: \"Immediate and unconditional emancipation!\" He\r\npromised his readers that he would be \"harsh as truth and uncompromising\r\nas justice\"; that he would not \"think or speak or write with\r\nmoderation.\" Then he flung out his defiant call: \"I am in earnest--I\r\nwill not equivocate--I will not excuse--I will not retreat a single\r\ninch--and I will be heard....\r\n\r\n     'Such is the vow I take, so help me God.'\"\r\n\r\nThough Garrison complained that \"the apathy of the people is enough to\r\nmake every statue leap from its pedestal,\" he soon learned how alive the\r\nmasses were to the meaning of his propaganda. Abolition orators were\r\nstoned in the street and hissed from the platform. Their meeting places\r\nwere often attacked and sometimes burned to the ground. Garrison himself\r\nwas assaulted in the streets of Boston, finding refuge from the angry\r\nmob behind prison bars. Lovejoy, a publisher in Alton, Illinois, for his\r\nwillingness to give abolition a fair hearing, was brutally murdered; his\r\nprinting press was broken to pieces as a warning to all those who\r\ndisturbed the nation's peace of mind. The South, doubly frightened by a\r\nslave revolt in 1831 which ended in the murder of a number of men,\r\nwomen, and children, closed all discussion of slavery in that section.\r\n\"Now,\" exclaimed Calhoun, \"it is a question which admits of neither\r\nconcession nor compromise.\"\r\n\r\nAs the opposition hardened, the anti-slavery agitation gathered in force\r\nand intensity. Whittier blew his blast from the New England hills:\r\n\r\n    \"No slave-hunt in our borders--no pirate on our strand;\r\n     No fetters in the Bay State--no slave upon our land.\"\r\n\r\nLowell, looking upon the espousal of a great cause as the noblest aim of\r\nhis art, ridiculed and excoriated bondage in the South. Those\r\nabolitionists, not gifted as speakers or writers, signed petitions\r\nagainst slavery and poured them in upon Congress. The flood of them was\r\nso continuous that the House of Representatives, forgetting its\r\ntraditions, adopted in 1836 a \"gag rule\" which prevented the reading of\r\nappeals and consigned them to the waste basket. Not until the Whigs were\r\nin power nearly ten years later was John Quincy Adams able, after a\r\nrelentless campaign, to carry a motion rescinding the rule.\r\n\r\nHow deep was the impression made upon the country by this agitation for\r\nimmediate and unconditional emancipation cannot be measured. If the\r\npopular vote for those candidates who opposed not slavery, but its\r\nextension to the territories, be taken as a standard, it was slight\r\nindeed. In 1844, the Free Soil candidate, Birney, polled 62,000 votes\r\nout of over a million and a half; the Free Soil vote of the next\r\ncampaign went beyond a quarter of a million, but the increase was due to\r\nthe strength of the leader, Martin Van Buren; four years afterward it\r\nreceded to 156,000, affording all the outward signs for the belief that\r\nthe pleas of the abolitionist found no widespread response among the\r\npeople. Yet the agitation undoubtedly ran deeper than the ballot box.\r\nYoung statesmen of the North, in whose hands the destiny of frightful\r\nyears was to lie, found their indifference to slavery broken and their\r\nconsciences stirred by the unending appeal and the tireless reiteration.\r\nCharles Sumner afterward boasted that he read the _Liberator_ two years\r\nbefore Wendell Phillips, the young Boston lawyer who cast aside his\r\nprofession to take up the dangerous cause.\r\n\r\n=Early Southern Opposition to Slavery.=--In the South, the sentiment\r\nagainst slavery was strong; it led some to believe that it would also\r\ncome to an end there in due time. Washington disliked it and directed in\r\nhis will that his own slaves should be set free after the death of his\r\nwife. Jefferson, looking into the future, condemned the system by which\r\nhe also lived, saying: \"Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure\r\nwhen we have removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of\r\nthe people that their liberties are the gift of God? Are they not to be\r\nviolated but with His wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I\r\nreflect that God is just; that His justice cannot sleep forever.\" Nor\r\ndid Southern men confine their sentiments to expressions of academic\r\nopinion. They accepted in 1787 the Ordinance which excluded slavery from\r\nthe Northwest territory forever and also the Missouri Compromise, which\r\nshut it out of a vast section of the Louisiana territory.\r\n\r\n=The Revolution in the Slave System.=--Among the representatives of\r\nSouth Carolina and Georgia, however, the anti-slavery views of\r\nWashington and Jefferson were by no means approved; and the drift of\r\nSouthern economy was decidedly in favor of extending and perpetuating,\r\nrather than abolishing, the system of chattel servitude. The invention\r\nof the cotton gin and textile machinery created a market for cotton\r\nwhich the planters, with all their skill and energy, could hardly\r\nsupply. Almost every available acre was brought under cotton culture as\r\nthe small farmers were driven steadily from the seaboard into the\r\nuplands or to the Northwest.\r\n\r\nThe demand for slaves to till the swiftly expanding fields was enormous.\r\nThe number of bondmen rose from 700,000 in Washington's day to more than\r\nthree millions in 1850. At the same time slavery itself was transformed.\r\nInstead of the homestead where the same family of masters kept the same\r\nfamilies of slaves from generation to generation, came the plantation\r\nsystem of the Far South and Southwest where masters were ever moving and\r\never extending their holdings of lands and slaves. This in turn reacted\r\non the older South where the raising of slaves for the market became a\r\nregular and highly profitable business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nJOHN C. CALHOUN]\r\n\r\n=Slavery Defended as a Positive Good.=--As the abolition agitation\r\nincreased and the planting system expanded, apologies for slavery became\r\nfainter and fainter in the South. Then apologies were superseded by\r\nclaims that slavery was a beneficial scheme of labor control. Calhoun,\r\nin a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, sounded the new note by\r\ndeclaring slavery \"instead of an evil, a good--a positive good.\" His\r\nreasoning was as follows: in every civilized society one portion of the\r\ncommunity must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the\r\narts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his\r\nmaster and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than\r\nthe free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts\r\nbetween capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this\r\nrespect, he concluded, \"will become more and more manifest, if left\r\nundisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in\r\nwealth and numbers.\"\r\n\r\n=Slave Owners Dominate Politics.=--The new doctrine of Calhoun was\r\neagerly seized by the planters as they came more and more to overshadow\r\nthe small farmers of the South and as they beheld the menace of\r\nabolition growing upon the horizon. It formed, as they viewed matters, a\r\nmoral defense for their labor system--sound, logical, invincible. It\r\nwarranted them in drawing together for the protection of an institution\r\nso necessary, so inevitable, so beneficent.\r\n\r\nThough in 1850 the slave owners were only about three hundred and fifty\r\nthousand in a national population of nearly twenty million whites, they\r\nhad an influence all out of proportion to their numbers. They were knit\r\ntogether by the bonds of a common interest. They had leisure and wealth.\r\nThey could travel and attend conferences and conventions. Throughout the\r\nSouth and largely in the North, they had the press, the schools, and the\r\npulpits on their side. They formed, as it were, a mighty union for the\r\nprotection and advancement of their common cause. Aided by those\r\nmechanics and farmers of the North who stuck by Jacksonian Democracy\r\nthrough thick and thin, the planters became a power in the federal\r\ngovernment. \"We nominate Presidents,\" exultantly boasted a Richmond\r\nnewspaper; \"the North elects them.\"\r\n\r\nThis jubilant Southern claim was conceded by William H. Seward, a\r\nRepublican Senator from New York, in a speech describing the power of\r\nslavery in the national government. \"A party,\" he said, \"is in one sense\r\na joint stock association, in which those who contribute most direct the\r\naction and management of the concern.... The slaveholders, contributing\r\nin an overwhelming proportion to the strength of the Democratic party,\r\nnecessarily dictate and prescribe its policy.\" He went on: \"The\r\nslaveholding class has become the governing power in each of the\r\nslaveholding states and it practically chooses thirty of the sixty-two\r\nmembers of the Senate, ninety of the two hundred and thirty-three\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives, and one hundred and five of the\r\ntwo hundred and ninety-five electors of President and Vice-President of\r\nthe United States.\" Then he considered the slave power in the Supreme\r\nCourt. \"That tribunal,\" he exclaimed, \"consists of a chief justice and\r\neight associate justices. Of these, five were called from slave states\r\nand four from free states. The opinions and bias of each of them were\r\ncarefully considered by the President and Senate when he was appointed.\r\nNot one of them was found wanting in soundness of politics, according to\r\nthe slaveholder's exposition of the Constitution.\" Such was the Northern\r\nview of the planting interest that, from the arena of national politics,\r\nchallenged the whole country in 1860.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF SLAVES IN THE SOUTHERN STATES]\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN NATIONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n=National Aspects of Slavery.=--It may be asked why it was that slavery,\r\nfounded originally on state law and subject to state government, was\r\ndrawn into the current of national affairs. The answer is simple. There\r\nwere, in the first place, constitutional reasons. The Congress of the\r\nUnited States had to make all needful rules for the government of the\r\nterritories, the District of Columbia, the forts and other property\r\nunder national authority; so it was compelled to determine whether\r\nslavery should exist in the places subject to its jurisdiction. Upon\r\nCongress was also conferred the power of admitting new states; whenever\r\na territory asked for admission, the issue could be raised as to whether\r\nslavery should be sanctioned or excluded. Under the Constitution,\r\nprovision was made for the return of runaway slaves; Congress had the\r\npower to enforce this clause by appropriate legislation. Since the\r\ncontrol of the post office was vested in the federal government, it had\r\nto face the problem raised by the transmission of abolition literature\r\nthrough the mails. Finally citizens had the right of petition; it\r\ninheres in all free government and it is expressly guaranteed by the\r\nfirst amendment to the Constitution. It was therefore legal for\r\nabolitionists to present to Congress their petitions, even if they asked\r\nfor something which it had no right to grant. It was thus impossible,\r\nconstitutionally, to draw a cordon around the slavery issue and confine\r\nthe discussion of it to state politics.\r\n\r\nThere were, in the second place, economic reasons why slavery was\r\ninevitably drawn into the national sphere. It was the basis of the\r\nplanting system which had direct commercial relations with the North and\r\nEuropean countries; it was affected by federal laws respecting tariffs,\r\nbounties, ship subsidies, banking, and kindred matters. The planters of\r\nthe South, almost without exception, looked upon the protective tariff\r\nas a tribute laid upon them for the benefit of Northern industries. As\r\nheavy borrowers of money in the North, they were generally in favor of\r\n\"easy money,\" if not paper currency, as an aid in the repayment of their\r\ndebts. This threw most of them into opposition to the Whig program for a\r\nUnited States Bank. All financial aids to American shipping they stoutly\r\nresisted, preferring to rely upon the cheaper service rendered by\r\nEnglish shippers. Internal improvements, those substantial ties that\r\nwere binding the West to the East and turning the traffic from New\r\nOrleans to Philadelphia and New York, they viewed with alarm. Free\r\nhomesteads from the public lands, which tended to overbalance the South\r\nby building free states, became to them a measure dangerous to their\r\ninterests. Thus national economic policies, which could not by any twist\r\nor turn be confined to state control, drew the slave system and its\r\ndefenders into the political conflict that centered at Washington.\r\n\r\n=Slavery and the Territories--the Missouri Compromise (1820).=--Though\r\nmen continually talked about \"taking slavery out of politics,\" it could\r\nnot be done. By 1818 slavery had become so entrenched and the\r\nanti-slavery sentiment so strong, that Missouri's quest for admission\r\nbrought both houses of Congress into a deadlock that was broken only by\r\ncompromise. The South, having half the Senators, could prevent the\r\nadmission of Missouri stripped of slavery; and the North, powerful in\r\nthe House of Representatives, could keep Missouri with slavery out of\r\nthe union indefinitely. An adjustment of pretensions was the last\r\nresort. Maine, separated from the parent state of Massachusetts, was\r\nbrought into the union with freedom and Missouri with bondage. At the\r\nsame time it was agreed that the remainder of the vast Louisiana\r\nterritory north of the parallel of 36° 30' should be, like the old\r\nNorthwest, forever free; while the southern portion was left to slavery.\r\nIn reality this was an immense gain for liberty. The area dedicated to\r\nfree farmers was many times greater than that left to the planters. The\r\nprinciple was once more asserted that Congress had full power to prevent\r\nslavery in the territories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE]\r\n\r\n=The Territorial Question Reopened by the Wilmot Proviso.=--To the\r\nSouthern leaders, the annexation of Texas and the conquest of Mexico\r\nmeant renewed security to the planting interest against the increasing\r\nwealth and population of the North. Texas, it was said, could be divided\r\ninto four slave states. The new territories secured by the treaty of\r\npeace with Mexico contained the promise of at least three more. Thus, as\r\neach new free soil state knocked for admission into the union, the\r\nSouth could demand as the price of its consent a new slave state. No\r\nwonder Southern statesmen saw, in the annexation of Texas and the\r\nconquest of Mexico, slavery and King Cotton triumphant--secure for all\r\ntime against adverse legislation. Northern leaders were equally\r\nconvinced that the Southern prophecy was true. Abolitionists and\r\nmoderate opponents of slavery alike were in despair. Texas, they\r\nlamented, would fasten slavery upon the country forevermore. \"No living\r\nman,\" cried one, \"will see the end of slavery in the United States!\"\r\n\r\nIt so happened, however, that the events which, it was thought, would\r\nsecure slavery let loose a storm against it. A sign appeared first on\r\nAugust 6, 1846, only a few months after war was declared on Mexico. On\r\nthat day, David Wilmot, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, introduced into\r\nthe House of Representatives a resolution to the effect that, as an\r\nexpress and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory\r\nfrom the republic of Mexico, slavery should be forever excluded from\r\nevery part of it. \"The Wilmot Proviso,\" as the resolution was popularly\r\ncalled, though defeated on that occasion, was a challenge to the South.\r\n\r\nThe South answered the challenge. Speaking in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, Robert Toombs of Georgia boldly declared: \"In the\r\npresence of the living God, if by your legislation you seek to drive us\r\nfrom the territories of California and New Mexico ... I am for\r\ndisunion.\" South Carolina announced that the day for talk had passed and\r\nthe time had come to join her sister states \"in resisting the\r\napplication of the Wilmot Proviso at any and all hazards.\" A conference,\r\nassembled at Jackson, Mississippi, in the autumn of 1849, called a\r\ngeneral convention of Southern states to meet at Nashville the following\r\nsummer. The avowed purpose was to arrest \"the course of aggression\" and,\r\nif that was not possible, to provide \"in the last resort for their\r\nseparate welfare by the formation of a compact and union that will\r\nafford protection to their liberties and rights.\" States that had\r\nspurned South Carolina's plea for nullification in 1832 responded to\r\nthis new appeal with alacrity--an augury of the secession to come.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print._\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY]\r\n\r\n=The Great Debate of 1850.=--The temper of the country was white hot\r\nwhen Congress convened in December, 1849. It was a memorable session,\r\nmemorable for the great men who took part in the debates and memorable\r\nfor the grand Compromise of 1850 which it produced. In the Senate sat\r\nfor the last time three heroic figures: Webster from the North, Calhoun\r\nfrom the South, and Clay from a border state. For nearly forty years\r\nthese three had been leaders of men. All had grown old and gray in\r\nservice. Calhoun was already broken in health and in a few months was to\r\nbe borne from the political arena forever. Clay and Webster had but two\r\nmore years in their allotted span.\r\n\r\nExperience, learning, statecraft--all these things they now marshaled in\r\na mighty effort to solve the slavery problem. On January 29, 1850, Clay\r\noffered to the Senate a compromise granting concessions to both sides;\r\nand a few days later, in a powerful oration, he made a passionate appeal\r\nfor a union of hearts through mutual sacrifices. Calhoun relentlessly\r\ndemanded the full measure of justice for the South: equal rights in the\r\nterritories bought by common blood; the return of runaway slaves as\r\nrequired by the Constitution; the suppression of the abolitionists; and\r\nthe restoration of the balance of power between the North and the South.\r\nWebster, in his notable \"Seventh of March speech,\" condemned the Wilmot\r\nProviso, advocated a strict enforcement of the fugitive slave law,\r\ndenounced the abolitionists, and made a final plea for the Constitution,\r\nunion, and liberty. This was the address which called forth from\r\nWhittier the poem, \"Ichabod,\" deploring the fall of the mighty one whom\r\nhe thought lost to all sense of faith and honor.\r\n\r\n=The Terms of the Compromise of 1850.=--When the debates were closed,\r\nthe results were totaled in a series of compromise measures, all of\r\nwhich were signed in September, 1850, by the new President, Millard\r\nFillmore, who had taken office two months before on the death of Zachary\r\nTaylor. By these acts the boundaries of Texas were adjusted and the\r\nterritory of New Mexico created, subject to the provision that all or\r\nany part of it might be admitted to the union \"with or without slavery\r\nas their constitution may provide at the time of their admission.\" The\r\nTerritory of Utah was similarly organized with the same conditions as to\r\nslavery, thus repudiating the Wilmot Proviso without guaranteeing\r\nslavery to the planters. California was admitted as a free state under a\r\nconstitution in which the people of the territory had themselves\r\nprohibited slavery.\r\n\r\nThe slave trade was abolished in the District of Columbia, but slavery\r\nitself existed as before at the capital of the nation. This concession\r\nto anti-slavery sentiment was more than offset by a fugitive slave law,\r\ndrastic in spirit and in letter. It placed the enforcement of its terms\r\nin the hands of federal officers appointed from Washington and so\r\nremoved it from the control of authorities locally elected. It provided\r\nthat masters or their agents, on filing claims in due form, might\r\nsummarily remove their escaped slaves without affording their \"alleged\r\nfugitives\" the right of trial by jury, the right to witness, the right\r\nto offer any testimony in evidence. Finally, to \"put teeth\" into the\r\nact, heavy penalties were prescribed for all who obstructed or assisted\r\nin obstructing the enforcement of the law. Such was the Great Compromise\r\nof 1850.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN OLD CARTOON REPRESENTING WEBSTER \"STEALING CLAY'S\r\nTHUNDER\"]\r\n\r\n=The Pro-slavery Triumph in the Election of 1852.=--The results of the\r\nelection of 1852 seemed to show conclusively that the nation was weary\r\nof slavery agitation and wanted peace. Both parties, Whigs and\r\nDemocrats, endorsed the fugitive slave law and approved the Great\r\nCompromise. The Democrats, with Franklin Pierce as their leader, swept\r\nthe country against the war hero, General Winfield Scott, on whom the\r\nWhigs had staked their hopes. Even Webster, broken with grief at his\r\nfailure to receive the nomination, advised his friends to vote for\r\nPierce and turned away from politics to meditate upon approaching death.\r\nThe verdict of the voters would seem to indicate that for the time\r\neverybody, save a handful of disgruntled agitators, looked upon Clay's\r\nsettlement as the last word. \"The people, especially the business men of\r\nthe country,\" says Elson, \"were utterly weary of the agitation and they\r\ngave their suffrages to the party that promised them rest.\" The Free\r\nSoil party, condemning slavery as \"a sin against God and a crime against\r\nman,\" and advocating freedom for the territories, failed to carry a\r\nsingle state. In fact it polled fewer votes than it had four years\r\nearlier--156,000 as against nearly 3,000,000, the combined vote of the\r\nWhigs and Democrats. It is not surprising, therefore, that President\r\nPierce, surrounded in his cabinet by strong Southern sympathizers, could\r\npromise to put an end to slavery agitation and to crush the abolition\r\nmovement in the bud.\r\n\r\n=Anti-slavery Agitation Continued.=--The promise was more difficult to\r\nfulfill than to utter. In fact, the vigorous execution of one measure\r\nincluded in the Compromise--the fugitive slave law--only made matters\r\nworse. Designed as security for the planters, it proved a powerful\r\ninstrument in their undoing. Slavery five hundred miles away on a\r\nLouisiana plantation was so remote from the North that only the\r\nstrongest imagination could maintain a constant rage against it. \"Slave\r\ncatching,\" \"man hunting\" by federal officers on the streets of\r\nPhiladelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, or Milwaukee and in the hamlets\r\nand villages of the wide-stretching farm lands of the North was another\r\nmatter. It brought the most odious aspects of slavery home to thousands\r\nof men and women who would otherwise have been indifferent to the\r\nsystem. Law-abiding business men, mechanics, farmers, and women, when\r\nthey saw peaceful negroes, who had resided in their neighborhoods\r\nperhaps for years, torn away by federal officers and carried back to\r\nbondage, were transformed into enemies of the law. They helped slaves to\r\nescape; they snatched them away from officers who had captured them;\r\nthey broke open jails and carried fugitives off to Canada.\r\n\r\nAssistance to runaway slaves, always more or less common in the North,\r\nwas by this time organized into a system. Regular routes, known as\r\n\"underground railways,\" were laid out across the free states into\r\nCanada, and trusted friends of freedom maintained \"underground stations\"\r\nwhere fugitives were concealed in the daytime between their long night\r\njourneys. Funds were raised and secret agents sent into the South to\r\nhelp negroes to flee. One negro woman, Harriet Tubman, \"the Moses of her\r\npeople,\" with headquarters at Philadelphia, is accredited with nineteen\r\ninvasions into slave territory and the emancipation of three hundred\r\nnegroes. Those who worked at this business were in constant peril. One\r\nunderground operator, Calvin Fairbank, spent nearly twenty years in\r\nprison for aiding fugitives from justice. Yet perils and prisons did not\r\nstay those determined men and women who, in obedience to their\r\nconsciences, set themselves to this lawless work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HARRIET BEECHER STOWE]\r\n\r\nFrom thrilling stories of adventure along the underground railways came\r\nsome of the scenes and themes of the novel by Harriet Beecher Stowe,\r\n\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" published two years after the Compromise of 1850.\r\nHer stirring tale set forth the worst features of slavery in vivid word\r\npictures that caught and held the attention of millions of readers.\r\nThough the book was unfair to the South and was denounced as a hideous\r\ndistortion of the truth, it was quickly dramatized and played in every\r\ncity and town throughout the North. Topsy, Little Eva, Uncle Tom, the\r\nfleeing slave, Eliza Harris, and the cruel slave driver, Simon Legree,\r\nwith his baying blood hounds, became living specters in many a home that\r\nsought to bar the door to the \"unpleasant and irritating business of\r\nslavery agitation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRIFT OF EVENTS TOWARD THE IRREPRESSIBLE CONFLICT\r\n\r\n=Repeal of the Missouri Compromise.=--To practical men, after all, the\r\n\"rub-a-dub\" agitation of a few abolitionists, an occasional riot over\r\nfugitive slaves, and the vogue of a popular novel seemed of slight or\r\ntransient importance. They could point with satisfaction to the election\r\nreturns of 1852; but their very security was founded upon shifting\r\nsands. The magnificent triumph of the pro-slavery Democrats in 1852\r\nbrought a turn in affairs that destroyed the foundations under their\r\nfeet. Emboldened by their own strength and the weakness of their\r\nopponents, they now dared to repeal the Missouri Compromise. The leader\r\nin this fateful enterprise was Stephen A. Douglas, Senator from\r\nIllinois, and the occasion for the deed was the demand for the\r\norganization of territorial government in the regions west of Iowa and\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nDouglas, like Clay and Webster before him, was consumed by a strong\r\npassion for the presidency, and, to reach his goal, it was necessary to\r\nwin the support of the South. This he undoubtedly sought to do when he\r\nintroduced on January 4, 1854, a bill organizing the Nebraska territory\r\non the principle of the Compromise of 1850; namely, that the people in\r\nthe territory might themselves decide whether they would have slavery or\r\nnot. Unwittingly the avalanche was started.\r\n\r\nAfter a stormy debate, in which important amendments were forced on\r\nDouglas, the Kansas-Nebraska Bill became a law on May 30, 1854. The\r\nmeasure created two territories, Kansas and Nebraska, and provided that\r\nthey, or territories organized out of them, could come into the union as\r\nstates \"with or without slavery as their constitutions may prescribe at\r\nthe time of their admission.\" Not content with this, the law went on to\r\ndeclare the Missouri Compromise null and void as being inconsistent with\r\nthe principle of non-intervention by Congress with slavery in the states\r\nand territories. Thus by a single blow the very heart of the continent,\r\ndedicated to freedom by solemn agreement, was thrown open to slavery. A\r\ndesperate struggle between slave owners and the advocates of freedom was\r\nthe outcome in Kansas.\r\n\r\nIf Douglas fancied that the North would receive the overthrow of the\r\nMissouri Compromise in the same temper that it greeted Clay's\r\nsettlement, he was rapidly disillusioned. A blast of rage, terrific in\r\nits fury, swept from Maine to Iowa. Staid old Boston hanged him in\r\neffigy with an inscription--\"Stephen A. Douglas, author of the infamous\r\nNebraska bill: the Benedict Arnold of 1854.\" City after city burned him\r\nin effigy until, as he himself said, he could travel from the Atlantic\r\ncoast to Chicago in the light of the fires. Thousands of Whigs and\r\nFree-soil Democrats deserted their parties which had sanctioned or at\r\nleast tolerated the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, declaring that the startling\r\nmeasure showed an evident resolve on the part of the planters to rule\r\nthe whole country. A gage of defiance was thrown down to the\r\nabolitionists. An issue was set even for the moderate and timid who had\r\nbeen unmoved by the agitation over slavery in the Far South. That issue\r\nwas whether slavery was to be confined within its existing boundaries or\r\nbe allowed to spread without interference, thereby placing the free\r\nstates in the minority and surrendering the federal government wholly to\r\nthe slave power.\r\n\r\n=The Rise of the Republican Party.=--Events of terrible significance,\r\nswiftly following, drove the country like a ship before a gale straight\r\ninto civil war. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill rent the old parties asunder\r\nand called into being the Republican party. While that bill was pending\r\nin Congress, many Northern Whigs and Democrats had come to the\r\nconclusion that a new party dedicated to freedom in the territories must\r\nfollow the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Several places claim to be\r\nthe original home of the Republican party; but historians generally\r\nyield it to Wisconsin. At Ripon in that state, a mass meeting of Whigs\r\nand Democrats assembled in February, 1854, and resolved to form a new\r\nparty if the Kansas-Nebraska Bill should pass. At a second meeting a\r\nfusion committee representing Whigs, Free Soilers, and Democrats was\r\nformed and the name Republican--the name of Jefferson's old party--was\r\nselected. All over the country similar meetings were held and political\r\ncommittees were organized.\r\n\r\nWhen the presidential campaign of 1856 began the Republicans entered the\r\ncontest. After a preliminary conference in Pittsburgh in February, they\r\nheld a convention in Philadelphia at which was drawn up a platform\r\nopposing the extension of slavery to the territories. John C. Frémont,\r\nthe distinguished explorer, was named for the presidency. The results\r\nof the election were astounding as compared with the Free-soil failure\r\nof the preceding election. Prominent men like Longfellow, Washington\r\nIrving, William Cullen Bryant, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and George William\r\nCurtis went over to the new party and 1,341,264 votes were rolled up for\r\n\"free labor, free speech, free men, free Kansas, and Frémont.\"\r\nNevertheless the victory of the Democrats was decisive. Their candidate,\r\nJames Buchanan of Pennsylvania, was elected by a majority of 174 to 114\r\nelectoral votes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAVE AND FREE SOIL ON EVE OF CIVIL WAR]\r\n\r\n=The Dred Scott Decision (1857).=--In his inaugural, Buchanan vaguely\r\nhinted that in a forthcoming decision the Supreme Court would settle one\r\nof the vital questions of the day. This was a reference to the Dred\r\nScott case then pending. Scott was a slave who had been taken by his\r\nmaster into the upper Louisiana territory, where freedom had been\r\nestablished by the Missouri Compromise, and then carried back into his\r\nold state of Missouri. He brought suit for his liberty on the ground\r\nthat his residence in the free territory made him free. This raised the\r\nquestion whether the law of Congress prohibiting slavery north of 36°\r\n30' was authorized by the federal Constitution or not. The Court might\r\nhave avoided answering it by saying that even though Scott was free in\r\nthe territory, he became a slave again in Missouri by virtue of the law\r\nof that state. The Court, however, faced the issue squarely. It held\r\nthat Scott had not been free anywhere and that, besides, the Missouri\r\nCompromise violated the Constitution and was null and void.\r\n\r\nThe decision was a triumph for the South. It meant that Congress after\r\nall had no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Under the decree\r\nof the highest court in the land, that could be done only by an\r\namendment to the Constitution which required a two-thirds vote in\r\nCongress and the approval of three-fourths of the states. Such an\r\namendment was obviously impossible--the Southern states were too\r\nnumerous; but the Republicans were not daunted. \"We know,\" said Lincoln,\r\n\"the Court that made it has often overruled its own decisions and we\r\nshall do what we can to have it overrule this.\" Legislatures of Northern\r\nstates passed resolutions condemning the decision and the Republican\r\nplatform of 1860 characterized the dogma that the Constitution carried\r\nslavery into the territories as \"a dangerous political heresy at\r\nvariance with the explicit provisions of that instrument itself ... with\r\nlegislative and judicial precedent ... revolutionary in tendency and\r\nsubversive of the peace and harmony of the country.\"\r\n\r\n=The Panic of 1857.=--In the midst of the acrimonious dispute over the\r\nDred Scott decision, came one of the worst business panics which ever\r\nafflicted the country. In the spring and summer of 1857, fourteen\r\nrailroad corporations, including the Erie, Michigan Central, and the\r\nIllinois Central, failed to meet their obligations; banks and insurance\r\ncompanies, some of them the largest and strongest institutions in the\r\nNorth, closed their doors; stocks and bonds came down in a crash on the\r\nmarkets; manufacturing was paralyzed; tens of thousands of working\r\npeople were thrown out of employment; \"hunger meetings\" of idle men were\r\nheld in the cities and banners bearing the inscription, \"We want\r\nbread,\" were flung out. In New York, working men threatened to invade\r\nthe Council Chamber to demand \"work or bread,\" and the frightened mayor\r\ncalled for the police and soldiers. For this distressing state of\r\naffairs many remedies were offered; none with more zeal and persistence\r\nthan the proposal for a higher tariff to take the place of the law of\r\nMarch, 1857, a Democratic measure making drastic reductions in the rates\r\nof duty. In the manufacturing districts of the North, the panic was\r\nascribed to the \"Democratic assault on business.\" So an old issue was\r\nagain vigorously advanced, preparatory to the next presidential\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n=The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.=--The following year the interest of the\r\nwhole country was drawn to a series of debates held in Illinois by\r\nLincoln and Douglas, both candidates for the United States Senate. In\r\nthe course of his campaign Lincoln had uttered his trenchant saying that\r\n\"a house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government\r\ncannot endure permanently half slave and half free.\" At the same time he\r\nhad accused Douglas, Buchanan, and the Supreme Court of acting in\r\nconcert to make slavery national. This daring statement arrested the\r\nattention of Douglas, who was making his campaign on the doctrine of\r\n\"squatter sovereignty;\" that is, the right of the people of each\r\nterritory \"to vote slavery up or down.\" After a few long-distance shots\r\nat each other, the candidates agreed to meet face to face and discuss\r\nthe issues of the day. Never had such crowds been seen at political\r\nmeetings in Illinois. Farmers deserted their plows, smiths their forges,\r\nand housewives their baking to hear \"Honest Abe\" and \"the Little Giant.\"\r\n\r\nThe results of the series of debates were momentous. Lincoln clearly\r\ndefined his position. The South, he admitted, was entitled under the\r\nConstitution to a fair, fugitive slave law. He hoped that there might be\r\nno new slave states; but he did not see how Congress could exclude the\r\npeople of a territory from admission as a state if they saw fit to adopt\r\na constitution legalizing the ownership of slaves. He favored the\r\ngradual abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia and the total\r\nexclusion of it from the territories of the United States by act of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he drove Douglas into a hole by asking how he squared\r\n\"squatter sovereignty\" with the Dred Scott decision; how, in other\r\nwords, the people of a territory could abolish slavery when the Court\r\nhad declared that Congress, the superior power, could not do it under\r\nthe Constitution? To this baffling question Douglas lamely replied that\r\nthe inhabitants of a territory, by \"unfriendly legislation,\" might make\r\nproperty in slaves insecure and thus destroy the institution. This\r\nanswer to Lincoln's query alienated many Southern Democrats who believed\r\nthat the Dred Scott decision settled the question of slavery in the\r\nterritories for all time. Douglas won the election to the Senate; but\r\nLincoln, lifted into national fame by the debates, beat him in the\r\ncampaign for President two years later.\r\n\r\n=John Brown's Raid.=--To the abolitionists the line of argument pursued\r\nby Lincoln, including his proposal to leave slavery untouched in the\r\nstates where it existed, was wholly unsatisfactory. One of them, a grim\r\nand resolute man, inflamed by a hatred for slavery in itself, turned\r\nfrom agitation to violence. \"These men are all talk; what is needed is\r\naction--action!\" So spoke John Brown of New York. During the sanguinary\r\nstruggle in Kansas he hurried to the frontier, gun and dagger in hand,\r\nto help drive slave owners from the free soil of the West. There he\r\ncommitted deeds of such daring and cruelty that he was outlawed and a\r\nprice put upon his head. Still he kept on the path of \"action.\" Aided by\r\nfunds from Northern friends, he gathered a small band of his followers\r\naround him, saying to them: \"If God be for us, who can be against us?\"\r\nHe went into Virginia in the autumn of 1859, hoping, as he explained,\r\n\"to effect a mighty conquest even though it be like the last victory of\r\nSamson.\" He seized the government armory at Harper's Ferry, declared\r\nfree the slaves whom he found, and called upon them to take up arms in\r\ndefense of their liberty. His was a hope as forlorn as it was desperate.\r\nArmed forces came down upon him and, after a hard battle, captured him.\r\nTried for treason, Brown was condemned to death. The governor of\r\nVirginia turned a deaf ear to pleas for clemency based on the ground\r\nthat the prisoner was simply a lunatic. \"This is a beautiful country,\"\r\nsaid the stern old Brown glancing upward to the eternal hills on his way\r\nto the gallows, as calmly as if he were returning home from a long\r\njourney. \"So perish all such enemies of Virginia. All such enemies of\r\nthe Union. All such foes of the human race,\" solemnly announced the\r\nexecutioner as he fulfilled the judgment of the law.\r\n\r\nThe raid and its grim ending deeply moved the country. Abolitionists\r\nlooked upon Brown as a martyr and tolled funeral bells on the day of his\r\nexecution. Longfellow wrote in his diary: \"This will be a great day in\r\nour history; the date of a new revolution as much needed as the old\r\none.\" Jefferson Davis saw in the affair \"the invasion of a state by a\r\nmurderous gang of abolitionists bent on inciting slaves to murder\r\nhelpless women and children\"--a crime for which the leader had met a\r\nfelon's death. Lincoln spoke of the raid as absurd, the deed of an\r\nenthusiast who had brooded over the oppression of a people until he\r\nfancied himself commissioned by heaven to liberate them--an attempt\r\nwhich ended in \"little else than his own execution.\" To Republican\r\nleaders as a whole, the event was very embarrassing. They were taunted\r\nby the Democrats with responsibility for the deed. Douglas declared his\r\n\"firm and deliberate conviction that the Harper's Ferry crime was the\r\nnatural, logical, inevitable result of the doctrines and teachings of\r\nthe Republican party.\" So persistent were such attacks that the\r\nRepublicans felt called upon in 1860 to denounce Brown's raid \"as among\r\nthe gravest of crimes.\"\r\n\r\n=The Democrats Divided.=--When the Democratic convention met at\r\nCharleston in the spring of 1860, a few months after Brown's execution,\r\nit soon became clear that there was danger ahead. Between the extreme\r\nslavery advocates of the Far South and the so-called pro-slavery\r\nDemocrats of the Douglas type, there was a chasm which no appeals to\r\nparty loyalty could bridge. As the spokesman of the West, Douglas knew\r\nthat, while the North was not abolitionist, it was passionately set\r\nagainst an extension of slavery into the territories by act of Congress;\r\nthat squatter sovereignty was the mildest kind of compromise acceptable\r\nto the farmers whose votes would determine the fate of the election.\r\nSouthern leaders would not accept his opinion. Yancey, speaking for\r\nAlabama, refused to palter with any plan not built on the proposition\r\nthat slavery was in itself right. He taunted the Northern Democrats with\r\ntaking the view that slavery was wrong, but that they could not do\r\nanything about it. That, he said, was the fatal error--the cause of all\r\ndiscord, the source of \"Black Republicanism,\" as well as squatter\r\nsovereignty. The gauntlet was thus thrown down at the feet of the\r\nNorthern delegates: \"You must not apologize for slavery; you must\r\ndeclare it right; you must advocate its extension.\" The challenge, so\r\nbluntly put, was as bluntly answered. \"Gentlemen of the South,\"\r\nresponded a delegate from Ohio, \"you mistake us. You mistake us. We will\r\nnot do it.\"\r\n\r\nFor ten days the Charleston convention wrangled over the platform and\r\nballoted for the nomination of a candidate. Douglas, though in the lead,\r\ncould not get the two-thirds vote required for victory. For more than\r\nfifty times the roll of the convention was called without a decision.\r\nThen in sheer desperation the convention adjourned to meet later at\r\nBaltimore. When the delegates again assembled, their passions ran as\r\nhigh as ever. The division into two irreconcilable factions was\r\nunchanged. Uncompromising delegates from the South withdrew to Richmond,\r\nnominated John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky for President, and put forth\r\na platform asserting the rights of slave owners in the territories and\r\nthe duty of the federal government to protect them. The delegates who\r\nremained at Baltimore nominated Douglas and endorsed his doctrine of\r\nsquatter sovereignty.\r\n\r\n=The Constitutional Union Party.=--While the Democratic party was being\r\ndisrupted, a fragment of the former Whig party, known as the\r\nConstitutional Unionists, held a convention at Baltimore and selected\r\nnational candidates: John Bell from Tennessee and Edward Everett from\r\nMassachusetts. A melancholy interest attached to this assembly. It was\r\nmainly composed of old men whose political views were those of Clay and\r\nWebster, cherished leaders now dead and gone. In their platform they\r\nsought to exorcise the evil spirit of partisanship by inviting their\r\nfellow citizens to \"support the Constitution of the country, the union\r\nof the states, and the enforcement of the laws.\" The party that\r\ncampaigned on this grand sentiment only drew laughter from the Democrats\r\nand derision from the Republicans and polled less than one-fourth the\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n=The Republican Convention.=--With the Whigs definitely forced into a\r\nseparate group, the Republican convention at Chicago was fated to be\r\nsectional in character, although five slave states did send delegates.\r\nAs the Democrats were split, the party that had led a forlorn hope four\r\nyears before was on the high road to success at last. New and powerful\r\nrecruits were found. The advocates of a high protective tariff and the\r\nfriends of free homesteads for farmers and workingmen mingled with\r\nenthusiastic foes of slavery. While still firm in their opposition to\r\nslavery in the territories, the Republicans went on record in favor of a\r\nhomestead law granting free lands to settlers and approved customs\r\nduties designed \"to encourage the development of the industrial\r\ninterests of the whole country.\" The platform was greeted with cheers\r\nwhich, according to the stenographic report of the convention, became\r\nloud and prolonged as the protective tariff and homestead planks were\r\nread.\r\n\r\nHaving skillfully drawn a platform to unite the North in opposition to\r\nslavery and the planting system, the Republicans were also adroit in\r\ntheir selection of a candidate. The tariff plank might carry\r\nPennsylvania, a Democratic state; but Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were\r\nequally essential to success at the polls. The southern counties of\r\nthese states were filled with settlers from Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nand Kentucky who, even if they had no love for slavery, were no friends\r\nof abolition. Moreover, remembering the old fight on the United States\r\nBank in Andrew Jackson's day, they were suspicious of men from the East.\r\nAccordingly, they did not favor the candidacy of Seward, the leading\r\nRepublican statesman and \"favorite son\" of New York.\r\n\r\nAfter much trading and discussing, the convention came to the conclusion\r\nthat Abraham Lincoln of Illinois was the most \"available\" candidate. He\r\nwas of Southern origin, born in Kentucky in 1809, a fact that told\r\nheavily in the campaign in the Ohio Valley. He was a man of the soil,\r\nthe son of poor frontier parents, a pioneer who in his youth had labored\r\nin the fields and forests, celebrated far and wide as \"honest Abe, the\r\nrail-splitter.\" It was well-known that he disliked slavery, but was no\r\nabolitionist. He had come dangerously near to Seward's radicalism in his\r\n\"house-divided-against-itself\" speech but he had never committed himself\r\nto the reckless doctrine that there was a \"higher law\" than the\r\nConstitution. Slavery in the South he tolerated as a bitter fact;\r\nslavery in the territories he opposed with all his strength. Of his\r\nsincerity there could be no doubt. He was a speaker and writer of\r\nsingular power, commanding, by the use of simple and homely language,\r\nthe hearts and minds of those who heard him speak or read his printed\r\nwords. He had gone far enough in his opposition to slavery; but not too\r\nfar. He was the man of the hour! Amid lusty cheers from ten thousand\r\nthroats, Lincoln was nominated for the presidency by the Republicans. In\r\nthe ensuing election, he carried all the free states except New Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nP.E. Chadwick, _Causes of the Civil War_ (American Nation Series).\r\n\r\nW.E.

If that calamity comes to pass, responded the governor\r\nof the state, the answer should be a declaration of independence. In a\r\nfew days the suspense was over. The news of Lincoln's election came\r\nspeeding along the wires. Prepared for the event, the editor of the\r\nCharleston _Mercury_ unfurled the flag of his state amid wild cheers\r\nfrom an excited throng in the streets. Then he seized his pen and wrote:\r\n\"The tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been\r\ninitiated.\" The issue was submitted to the voters in the choice of\r\ndelegates to a state convention called to cast off the yoke of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY\r\n\r\n=Secession.=--As arranged, the convention of South Carolina assembled in\r\nDecember and without a dissenting voice passed the ordinance of\r\nsecession withdrawing from the union. Bells were rung exultantly, the\r\nroar of cannon carried the news to outlying counties, fireworks lighted\r\nup the heavens, and champagne flowed. The crisis so long expected had\r\ncome at last; even the conservatives who had prayed that they might\r\nescape the dreadful crash greeted it with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1861\r\n\r\nThe border states (in purple) remained loyal.]\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina now sent forth an appeal to her sister states--states\r\nthat had in Jackson's day repudiated nullification as leading to \"the\r\ndissolution of the union.\" The answer that came this time was in a\r\ndifferent vein. A month had hardly elapsed before five other\r\nstates--Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana--had\r\nwithdrawn from the union. In February, Texas followed. Virginia,\r\nhesitating until the bombardment of Fort Sumter forced a conclusion,\r\nseceded in April; but fifty-five of the one hundred and forty-three\r\ndelegates dissented, foreshadowing the creation of the new state of West\r\nVirginia which Congress admitted to the union in 1863. In May, North\r\nCarolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee announced their independence.\r\n\r\n=Secession and the Theories of the Union.=--In severing their relations\r\nwith the union, the seceding states denied every point in the Northern\r\ntheory of the Constitution. That theory, as every one knows, was\r\ncarefully formulated by Webster and elaborated by Lincoln. According to\r\nit, the union was older than the states; it was created before the\r\nDeclaration of Independence for the purpose of common defense. The\r\nArticles of Confederation did but strengthen this national bond and the\r\nConstitution sealed it forever. The federal government was not a\r\ncreature of state governments. It was erected by the people and derived\r\nits powers directly from them. \"It is,\" said Webster, \"the people's\r\nConstitution, the people's government; made for the people; made by the\r\npeople; and answerable to the people. The people of the United States\r\nhave declared that this Constitution shall be the supreme law.\" When a\r\nstate questions the lawfulness of any act of the federal government, it\r\ncannot nullify that act or withdraw from the union; it must abide by the\r\ndecision of the Supreme Court of the United States. The union of these\r\nstates is perpetual, ran Lincoln's simple argument in the first\r\ninaugural; the federal Constitution has no provision for its own\r\ntermination; it can be destroyed only by some action not provided for in\r\nthe instrument itself; even if it is a compact among all the states the\r\nconsent of all must be necessary to its dissolution; therefore no state\r\ncan lawfully get out of the union and acts of violence against the\r\nUnited States are insurrectionary or revolutionary. This was the system\r\nwhich he believed himself bound to defend by his oath of office\r\n\"registered in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nAll this reasoning Southern statesmen utterly rejected. In their opinion\r\nthe thirteen original states won their independence as separate and\r\nsovereign powers. The treaty of peace with Great Britain named them all\r\nand acknowledged them \"to be free, sovereign, and independent states.\"\r\nThe Articles of Confederation very explicitly declared that \"each state\r\nretains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence.\" The Constitution\r\nwas a \"league of nations\" formed by an alliance of thirteen separate\r\npowers, each one of which ratified the instrument before it was put into\r\neffect. They voluntarily entered the union under the Constitution and\r\nvoluntarily they could leave it. Such was the constitutional doctrine of\r\nHayne, Calhoun, and Jefferson Davis. In seceding, the Southern states\r\nhad only to follow legal methods, and the transaction would be correct\r\nin every particular. So conventions were summoned, elections were held,\r\nand \"sovereign assemblies of the people\" set aside the Constitution in\r\nthe same manner as it had been ratified nearly four score years before.\r\nThus, said the Southern people, the moral judgment was fulfilled and the\r\nletter of the law carried into effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS]\r\n\r\n=The Formation of the Confederacy.=--Acting on the call of Mississippi,\r\na congress of delegates from the seceded states met at Montgomery,\r\nAlabama, and on February 8, 1861, adopted a temporary plan of union. It\r\nselected, as provisional president, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, a\r\nman well fitted by experience and moderation for leadership, a graduate\r\nof West Point, who had rendered distinguished service on the field of\r\nbattle in the Mexican War, in public office, and as a member of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nIn March, a permanent constitution of the Confederate states was\r\ndrafted. It was quickly ratified by the states; elections were held in\r\nNovember; and the government under it went into effect the next year.\r\nThis new constitution, in form, was very much like the famous instrument\r\ndrafted at Philadelphia in 1787. It provided for a President, a Senate,\r\nand a House of Representatives along almost identical lines. In the\r\npowers conferred upon them, however, there were striking differences.\r\nThe right to appropriate money for internal improvements was expressly\r\nwithheld; bounties were not to be granted from the treasury nor import\r\nduties so laid as to promote or foster any branch of industry. The\r\ndignity of the state, if any might be bold enough to question it, was\r\nsafeguarded in the opening line by the declaration that each acted \"in\r\nits sovereign and independent character\" in forming the Southern union.\r\n\r\n=Financing the Confederacy.=--No government ever set out upon its career\r\nwith more perplexing tasks in front of it. The North had a monetary\r\nsystem; the South had to create one. The North had a scheme of taxation\r\nthat produced large revenues from numerous sources; the South had to\r\nformulate and carry out a financial plan. Like the North, the\r\nConfederacy expected to secure a large revenue from customs duties,\r\neasily collected and little felt among the masses. To this expectation\r\nthe blockade of Southern ports inaugurated by Lincoln in April, 1861,\r\nsoon put an end. Following the precedent set by Congress under the\r\nArticles of Confederation, the Southern Congress resorted to a direct\r\nproperty tax apportioned among the states, only to meet the failure that\r\nmight have been foretold.\r\n\r\nThe Confederacy also sold bonds, the first issue bringing into the\r\ntreasury nearly all the specie available in the Southern banks. This\r\nspecie by unhappy management was early sent abroad to pay for supplies,\r\nsapping the foundations of a sound currency system. Large amounts of\r\nbonds were sold overseas, commanding at first better terms than those\r\nof the North in the markets of London, Paris, and Amsterdam, many an\r\nEnglish lord and statesman buying with enthusiasm and confidence to\r\nlament within a few years the proofs of his folly. The difficulties of\r\nbringing through the blockade any supplies purchased by foreign bond\r\nissues, however, nullified the effect of foreign credit and forced the\r\nConfederacy back upon the device of paper money. In all approximately\r\none billion dollars streamed from the printing presses, to fall in value\r\nat an alarming rate, reaching in January, 1863, the astounding figure of\r\nfifty dollars in paper money for one in gold. Every known device was\r\nused to prevent its depreciation, without result. To the issues of the\r\nConfederate Congress were added untold millions poured out by the states\r\nand by private banks.\r\n\r\n=Human and Material Resources.=--When we measure strength for strength\r\nin those signs of power--men, money, and supplies--it is difficult to\r\nsee how the South was able to embark on secession and war with such\r\nconfidence in the outcome. In the Confederacy at the final reckoning\r\nthere were eleven states in all, to be pitted against twenty-two; a\r\npopulation of nine millions, nearly one-half servile, to be pitted\r\nagainst twenty-two millions; a land without great industries to produce\r\nwar supplies and without vast capital to furnish war finances, joined in\r\nbattle with a nation already industrial and fortified by property worth\r\neleven billion dollars. Even after the Confederate Congress authorized\r\nconscription in 1862, Southern man power, measured in numbers, was\r\nwholly inadequate to uphold the independence which had been declared.\r\nHow, therefore, could the Confederacy hope to sustain itself against\r\nsuch a combination of men, money, and materials as the North could\r\nmarshal?\r\n\r\n=Southern Expectations.=--The answer to this question is to be found in\r\nthe ideas that prevailed among Southern leaders. First of all, they\r\nhoped, in vain, to carry the Confederacy up to the Ohio River; and, with\r\nthe aid of Missouri, to gain possession of the Mississippi Valley, the\r\ngranary of the nation. In the second place, they reckoned upon a large\r\nand continuous trade with Great Britain--the exchange of cotton for war\r\nmaterials. They likewise expected to receive recognition and open aid\r\nfrom European powers that looked with satisfaction upon the breakup of\r\nthe great American republic. In the third place, they believed that\r\ntheir control over several staples so essential to Northern industry\r\nwould enable them to bring on an industrial crisis in the manufacturing\r\nstates. \"I firmly believe,\" wrote Senator Hammond, of South Carolina, in\r\n1860, \"that the slave-holding South is now the controlling power of the\r\nworld; that no other power would face us in hostility. Cotton, rice,\r\ntobacco, and naval stores command the world; and we have the sense to\r\nknow it and are sufficiently Teutonic to carry it out successfully. The\r\nNorth without us would be a motherless calf, bleating about, and die of\r\nmange and starvation.\"\r\n\r\nThere were other grounds for confidence. Having seized all of the\r\nfederal military and naval supplies in the South, and having left the\r\nnational government weak in armed power during their possession of the\r\npresidency, Southern leaders looked to a swift war, if it came at all,\r\nto put the finishing stroke to independence. \"The greasy mechanics of\r\nthe North,\" it was repeatedly said, \"will not fight.\" As to disparity in\r\nnumbers they drew historic parallels. \"Our fathers, a mere handful,\r\novercame the enormous power of Great Britain,\" a saying of ex-President\r\nTyler, ran current to reassure the doubtful. Finally, and this point\r\ncannot be too strongly emphasized, the South expected to see a weakened\r\nand divided North. It knew that the abolitionists and the Southern\r\nsympathizers were ready to let the Confederate states go in peace; that\r\nLincoln represented only a little more than one-third the voters of the\r\ncountry; and that the vote for Douglas, Bell, and Breckinridge meant a\r\ndecided opposition to the Republicans and their policies.\r\n\r\n=Efforts at Compromise.=--Republican leaders, on reviewing the same\r\nfacts, were themselves uncertain as to the outcome of a civil war and\r\nmade many efforts to avoid a crisis. Thurlow Weed, an Albany journalist\r\nand politician who had done much to carry New York for Lincoln, proposed\r\na plan for extending the Missouri Compromise line to the Pacific.\r\nJefferson Davis, warning his followers that a war if it came would be\r\nterrible, was prepared to accept the offer; but Lincoln, remembering his\r\ncampaign pledges, stood firm as a rock against it. His followers in\r\nCongress took the same position with regard to a similar settlement\r\nsuggested by Senator Crittenden of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThough unwilling to surrender his solemn promises respecting slavery in\r\nthe territories, Lincoln was prepared to give to Southern leaders a\r\nstrong guarantee that his administration would not interfere directly or\r\nindirectly with slavery in the states. Anxious to reassure the South on\r\nthis point, the Republicans in Congress proposed to write into the\r\nConstitution a declaration that no amendment should ever be made\r\nauthorizing the abolition of or interference with slavery in any state.\r\nThe resolution, duly passed, was sent forth on March 4, 1861, with the\r\napproval of Lincoln; it was actually ratified by three states before the\r\nstorm of war destroyed it. By the irony of fate the thirteenth amendment\r\nwas to abolish, not guarantee, slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAR MEASURES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n=Raising the Armies.=--The crisis at Fort Sumter, on April 12-14, 1861,\r\nforced the President and Congress to turn from negotiations to problems\r\nof warfare. Little did they realize the magnitude of the task before\r\nthem. Lincoln's first call for volunteers, issued on April 15, 1861,\r\nlimited the number to 75,000, put their term of service at three months,\r\nand prescribed their duty as the enforcement of the law against\r\ncombinations too powerful to be overcome by ordinary judicial process.\r\nDisillusionment swiftly followed. The terrible defeat of the Federals at\r\nBull Run on July 21 revealed the serious character of the task before\r\nthem; and by a series of measures Congress put the entire man power of\r\nthe country at the President's command. Under these acts, he issued new\r\ncalls for volunteers. Early in August, 1862, he ordered a draft of\r\nmilitiamen numbering 300,000 for nine months' service. The results were\r\ndisappointing--ominous--for only about 87,000 soldiers were added to the\r\narmy. Something more drastic was clearly necessary.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1863, Lincoln signed the inevitable draft law; it enrolled in\r\nthe national forces liable to military duty all able-bodied male\r\ncitizens and persons of foreign birth who had declared their intention\r\nto become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five\r\nyears--with exemptions on grounds of physical weakness and dependency.\r\nFrom the men enrolled were drawn by lot those destined to active\r\nservice. Unhappily the measure struck a mortal blow at the principle of\r\nuniversal liability by excusing any person who found a substitute for\r\nhimself or paid into the war office a sum, not exceeding three hundred\r\ndollars, to be fixed by general order. This provision, so crass and so\r\nobviously favoring the well-to-do, sowed seeds of bitterness which\r\nsprang up a hundredfold in the North.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DRAFT RIOTS IN NEW YORK CITY]\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the drawings under the draft act in New York City, on\r\nMonday, July 13, 1863, was the signal for four days of rioting. In the\r\ncourse of this uprising, draft headquarters were destroyed; the office\r\nof the _Tribune_ was gutted; negroes were seized, hanged, and shot; the\r\nhomes of obnoxious Unionists were burned down; the residence of the\r\nmayor of the city was attacked; and regular battles were fought in the\r\nstreets between the rioters and the police. Business stopped and a large\r\npart of the city passed absolutely into the control of the mob. Not\r\nuntil late the following Wednesday did enough troops arrive to restore\r\norder and enable the residents of the city to resume their daily\r\nactivities. At least a thousand people had been killed or wounded and\r\nmore than a million dollars' worth of damage done to property. The draft\r\ntemporarily interrupted by this outbreak was then resumed and carried\r\nout without further trouble.\r\n\r\nThe results of the draft were in the end distinctly disappointing to the\r\ngovernment. The exemptions were numerous and the number who preferred\r\nand were able to pay $300 rather than serve exceeded all expectations.\r\nVolunteering, it is true, was stimulated, but even that resource could\r\nhardly keep the thinning ranks of the army filled. With reluctance\r\nCongress struck out the $300 exemption clause, but still favored the\r\nwell-to-do by allowing them to hire substitutes if they could find them.\r\nWith all this power in its hands the administration was able by January,\r\n1865, to construct a union army that outnumbered the Confederates two to\r\none.\r\n\r\n=War Finance.=--In the financial sphere the North faced immense\r\ndifficulties. The surplus in the treasury had been dissipated by 1861\r\nand the tariff of 1857 had failed to produce an income sufficient to\r\nmeet the ordinary expenses of the government. Confronted by military and\r\nnaval expenditures of appalling magnitude, rising from $35,000,000 in\r\nthe first year of the war to $1,153,000,000 in the last year, the\r\nadministration had to tap every available source of income. The duties\r\non imports were increased, not once but many times, producing huge\r\nrevenues and also meeting the most extravagant demands of the\r\nmanufacturers for protection. Direct taxes were imposed on the states\r\naccording to their respective populations, but the returns were\r\nmeager--all out of proportion to the irritation involved. Stamp taxes\r\nand taxes on luxuries, occupations, and the earnings of corporations\r\nwere laid with a weight that, in ordinary times, would have drawn forth\r\nopposition of ominous strength. The whole gamut of taxation was run.\r\nEven a tax on incomes and gains by the year, the first in the history of\r\nthe federal government, was included in the long list.\r\n\r\nRevenues were supplemented by bond issues, mounting in size and interest\r\nrate, until in October, at the end of the war, the debt stood at\r\n$2,208,000,000. The total cost of the war was many times the money value\r\nof all the slaves in the Southern states. To the debt must be added\r\nnearly half a billion dollars in \"greenbacks\"--paper money issued by\r\nCongress in desperation as bond sales and revenues from taxes failed to\r\nmeet the rising expenditures. This currency issued at par on\r\nquestionable warrant from the Constitution, like all such paper, quickly\r\nbegan to decline until in the worst fortunes of 1864 one dollar in gold\r\nwas worth nearly three in greenbacks.\r\n\r\n=The Blockade of Southern Ports.=--Four days after his call for\r\nvolunteers, April 19, 1861, President Lincoln issued a proclamation\r\nblockading the ports of the Southern Confederacy. Later the blockade was\r\nextended to Virginia and North Carolina, as they withdrew from the\r\nunion. Vessels attempting to enter or leave these ports, if they\r\ndisregarded the warnings of a blockading ship, were to be captured and\r\nbrought as prizes to the nearest convenient port. To make the order\r\neffective, immediate steps were taken to increase the naval forces,\r\ndepleted by neglect, until the entire coast line was patrolled with such\r\na number of ships that it was a rare captain who ventured to run the\r\ngantlet. The collision between the _Merrimac_ and the _Monitor_ in\r\nMarch, 1862, sealed the fate of the Confederacy. The exploits of the\r\nunion navy are recorded in the falling export of cotton: $202,000,000 in\r\n1860; $42,000,000 in 1861; and $4,000,000 in 1862.\r\n\r\nThe deadly effect of this paralysis of trade upon Southern war power may\r\nbe readily imagined. Foreign loans, payable in cotton, could be\r\nnegotiated but not paid off. Supplies could be purchased on credit but\r\nnot brought through the drag net. With extreme difficulty could the\r\nConfederate government secure even paper for the issue of money and\r\nbonds. Publishers, in despair at the loss of supplies, were finally\r\ndriven to the use of brown wrapping paper and wall paper. As the\r\nrailways and rolling stock wore out, it became impossible to renew them\r\nfrom England or France. Unable to export their cotton, planters on the\r\nseaboard burned it in what were called \"fires of patriotism.\" In their\r\nlurid light the fatal weakness of Southern economy stood revealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BLOCKADE RUNNER]\r\n\r\n=Diplomacy.=--The war had not advanced far before the federal government\r\nbecame involved in many perplexing problems of diplomacy in Europe. The\r\nConfederacy early turned to England and France for financial aid and for\r\nrecognition as an independent power. Davis believed that the industrial\r\ncrisis created by the cotton blockade would in time literally compel\r\nEurope to intervene in order to get this essential staple. The crisis\r\ncame as he expected but not the result. Thousands of English textile\r\nworkers were thrown out of employment; and yet, while on the point of\r\nstarvation, they adopted resolutions favoring the North instead of\r\npetitioning their government to aid the South by breaking the blockade.\r\n\r\nWith the ruling classes it was far otherwise. Napoleon III, the Emperor\r\nof the French, was eager to help in disrupting the American republic; if\r\nhe could have won England's support, he would have carried out his\r\ndesigns. As it turned out he found plenty of sympathy across the Channel\r\nbut not open and official coöperation. According to the eminent\r\nhistorian, Rhodes, \"four-fifths of the British House of Lords and most\r\nmembers of the House of Commons were favorable to the Confederacy and\r\nanxious for its triumph.\" Late in 1862 the British ministers, thus\r\nsustained, were on the point of recognizing the independence of the\r\nConfederacy. Had it not been for their extreme caution, for the constant\r\nand harassing criticism by English friends of the United States--like\r\nJohn Bright--and for the victories of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, both\r\nEngland and France would have doubtless declared the Confederacy to be\r\none of the independent powers of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN BRIGHT]\r\n\r\nWhile stopping short of recognizing its independence, England and France\r\ntook several steps that were in favor of the South. In proclaiming\r\nneutrality, they early accepted the Confederates as \"belligerents\" and\r\naccorded them the rights of people at war--a measure which aroused anger\r\nin the North at first but was later admitted to be sound. Otherwise\r\nConfederates taken in battle would have been regarded as \"rebels\" or\r\n\"traitors\" to be hanged or shot. Napoleon III proposed to Russia in 1861\r\na coalition of powers against the North, only to meet a firm refusal.\r\nThe next year he suggested intervention to Great Britain, encountering\r\nthis time a conditional rejection of his plans. In 1863, not daunted by\r\nrebuffs, he offered his services to Lincoln as a mediator, receiving in\r\nreply a polite letter declining his proposal and a sharp resolution from\r\nCongress suggesting that he attend to his own affairs.\r\n\r\nIn both England and France the governments pursued a policy of\r\nfriendliness to the Confederate agents. The British ministry, with\r\nindifference if not connivance, permitted rams and ships to be built in\r\nBritish docks and allowed them to escape to play havoc under the\r\nConfederate flag with American commerce. One of them, the _Alabama_,\r\nbuilt in Liverpool by a British firm and paid for by bonds sold in\r\nEngland, ran an extraordinary career and threatened to break the\r\nblockade. The course followed by the British government, against the\r\nprotests of the American minister in London, was later regretted. By an\r\naward of a tribunal of arbitration at Geneva in 1872, Great Britain was\r\nrequired to pay the huge sum of $15,500,000 to cover the damages wrought\r\nby Confederate cruisers fitted out in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM H. SEWARD]\r\n\r\nIn all fairness it should be said that the conduct of the North\r\ncontributed to the irritation between the two countries. Seward, the\r\nSecretary of State, was vindictive in dealing with Great Britain; had it\r\nnot been for the moderation of Lincoln, he would have pursued a course\r\nverging in the direction of open war. The New York and Boston papers\r\nwere severe in their attacks on England. Words were, on one occasion at\r\nleast, accompanied by an act savoring of open hostility. In November,\r\n1861, Captain Wilkes, commanding a union vessel, overhauled the British\r\nsteamer _Trent_, and carried off by force two Confederate agents, Mason\r\nand Slidell, sent by President Davis to represent the Confederacy at\r\nLondon and Paris respectively. This was a clear violation of the right\r\nof merchant vessels to be immune from search and impressment; and, in\r\nanswer to the demand of Great Britain for the release of the two men,\r\nthe United States conceded that it was in the wrong. It surrendered the\r\ntwo Confederate agents to a British vessel for safe conduct abroad, and\r\nmade appropriate apologies.\r\n\r\n=Emancipation.=--Among the extreme war measures adopted by the Northern\r\ngovernment must be counted the emancipation of the slaves in the states\r\nin arms against the union. This step was early and repeatedly suggested\r\nto Lincoln by the abolitionists; but was steadily put aside. He knew\r\nthat the abolitionists were a mere handful, that emancipation might\r\ndrive the border states into secession, and that the Northern soldiers\r\nhad enlisted to save the union. Moreover, he had before him a solemn\r\nresolution passed by Congress on July 22, 1861, declaring the sole\r\npurpose of the war to be the salvation of the union and disavowing any\r\nintention of interfering with slavery.\r\n\r\nThe federal government, though pledged to the preservation of slavery,\r\nsoon found itself beaten back upon its course and out upon a new tack.\r\nBefore a year had elapsed, namely on April 10, 1862, Congress resolved\r\nthat financial aid should be given to any state that might adopt gradual\r\nemancipation. Six days later it abolished slavery in the District of\r\nColumbia. Two short months elapsed. On June 19, 1862, it swept slavery\r\nforever from the territories of the United States. Chief Justice Taney\r\nstill lived, the Dred Scott decision stood as written in the book, but\r\nthe Constitution had been re-read in the light of the Civil War. The\r\ndrift of public sentiment in the North was being revealed.\r\n\r\nWhile these measures were pending in Congress, Lincoln was slowly making\r\nup his mind. By July of that year he had come to his great decision.\r\nNear the end of that month he read to his cabinet the draft of a\r\nproclamation of emancipation; but he laid it aside until a military\r\nachievement would make it something more than an idle gesture. In\r\nSeptember, the severe check administered to Lee at Antietam seemed to\r\noffer the golden opportunity. On the 22d, the immortal document was\r\ngiven to the world announcing that, unless the states in arms returned\r\nto the union by January 1, 1863, the fatal blow at their \"peculiar\r\ninstitution\" would be delivered. Southern leaders treated it with slight\r\nregard, and so on the date set the promise was fulfilled. The\r\nproclamation was issued as a war measure, adopted by the President as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the armed forces, on grounds of military\r\nnecessity. It did not abolish slavery. It simply emancipated slaves in\r\nplaces then in arms against federal authority. Everywhere else slavery,\r\nas far as the Proclamation was concerned, remained lawful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABRAHAM LINCOLN]\r\n\r\nTo seal forever the proclamation of emancipation, and to extend freedom\r\nto the whole country, Congress, in January, 1865, on the urgent\r\nrecommendation of Lincoln, transmitted to the states the thirteenth\r\namendment, abolishing slavery throughout the United States. By the end\r\nof 1865 the amendment was ratified. The house was not divided against\r\nitself; it did not fall; it was all free.\r\n\r\n=The Restraint of Civil Liberty.=--As in all great wars, particularly\r\nthose in the nature of a civil strife, it was found necessary to use\r\nstrong measures to sustain opinion favorable to the administration's\r\nmilitary policies and to frustrate the designs of those who sought to\r\nhamper its action. Within two weeks of his first call for volunteers,\r\nLincoln empowered General Scott to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nalong the line of march between Philadelphia and Washington and thus to\r\narrest and hold without interference from civil courts any one whom he\r\ndeemed a menace to the union. At a later date the area thus ruled by\r\nmilitary officers was extended by executive proclamation. By an act of\r\nMarch 3, 1863, Congress, desiring to lay all doubts about the\r\nPresident's power, authorized him to suspend the writ throughout the\r\nUnited States or in any part thereof. It also freed military officers\r\nfrom the necessity of surrendering to civil courts persons arrested\r\nunder their orders, or even making answers to writs issued from such\r\ncourts. In the autumn of that year the President, acting under the terms\r\nof this law, declared this ancient and honorable instrument for the\r\nprotection of civil liberties, the _habeas corpus_, suspended throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the land. The power of the government was also\r\nstrengthened by an act defining and punishing certain conspiracies,\r\npassed on July 31, 1861--a measure which imposed heavy penalties on\r\nthose who by force, intimidation, or threat interfered with the\r\nexecution of the law.\r\n\r\nThus doubly armed, the military authorities spared no one suspected of\r\nactive sympathy with the Southern cause. Editors were arrested and\r\nimprisoned, their papers suspended, and their newsboys locked up. Those\r\nwho organized \"peace meetings\" soon found themselves in the toils of the\r\nlaw. Members of the Maryland legislature, the mayor of Baltimore, and\r\nlocal editors suspected of entertaining secessionist opinions, were\r\nimprisoned on military orders although charged with no offense, and were\r\ndenied the privilege of examination before a civil magistrate. A Vermont\r\nfarmer, too outspoken in his criticism of the government, found himself\r\nbehind the bars until the government, in its good pleasure, saw fit to\r\nrelease him. These measures were not confined to the theater of war nor\r\nto the border states where the spirit of secession was strong enough to\r\nendanger the cause of union. They were applied all through the Northern\r\nstates up to the very boundaries of Canada. Zeal for the national cause,\r\ntoo often supplemented by a zeal for persecution, spread terror among\r\nthose who wavered in the singleness of their devotion to the union.\r\n\r\nThese drastic operations on the part of military authorities, so foreign\r\nto the normal course of civilized life, naturally aroused intense and\r\nbitter hostility. Meetings of protest were held throughout the country.\r\nThirty-six members of the House of Representatives sought to put on\r\nrecord their condemnation of the suspension of the _habeas corpus_ act,\r\nonly to meet a firm denial by the supporters of the act. Chief Justice\r\nTaney, before whom the case of a man arrested under the President's\r\nmilitary authority was brought, emphatically declared, in a long and\r\nlearned opinion bristling with historical examples, that the President\r\nhad no power to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_. In Congress and\r\nout, Democrats, abolitionists, and champions of civil liberty denounced\r\nLincoln and his Cabinet in unsparing terms. Vallandigham, a Democratic\r\nleader of Ohio, afterward banished to the South for his opposition to\r\nthe war, constantly applied to Lincoln the epithet of \"Cæsar.\" Wendell\r\nPhillips saw in him \"a more unlimited despot than the world knows this\r\nside of China.\"\r\n\r\nSensitive to such stinging thrusts and no friend of wanton persecution,\r\nLincoln attempted to mitigate the rigors of the law by paroling many\r\npolitical prisoners. The general policy, however, he defended in homely\r\nlanguage, very different in tone and meaning from the involved reasoning\r\nof the lawyers. \"Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,\r\nwhile I must not touch a hair of the wily agitator who induces him to\r\ndesert?\" he asked in a quiet way of some spokesmen for those who\r\nprotested against arresting people for \"talking against the war.\" This\r\nsummed up his philosophy. He was engaged in a war to save the union, and\r\nall measures necessary and proper to accomplish that purpose were\r\nwarranted by the Constitution which he had sworn to uphold.\r\n\r\n=Military Strategy--North and South.=--The broad outlines of military\r\nstrategy followed by the commanders of the opposing forces are clear\r\neven to the layman who cannot be expected to master the details of a\r\ncampaign or, for that matter, the maneuvers of a single great battle.\r\nThe problem for the South was one of defense mainly, though even for\r\ndefense swift and paralyzing strokes at the North were later deemed\r\nimperative measures. The problem of the North was, to put it baldly, one\r\nof invasion and conquest. Southern territory had to be invaded and\r\nSouthern armies beaten on their own ground or worn down to exhaustion\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of this undertaking, geography, as usual, played a\r\nsignificant part in the disposition of forces. The Appalachian ranges,\r\nstretching through the Confederacy to Northern Alabama, divided the\r\ncampaigns into Eastern and Western enterprises. Both were of signal\r\nimportance. Victory in the East promised the capture of the Confederate\r\ncapital of Richmond, a stroke of moral worth, hardly to be\r\noverestimated. Victory in the West meant severing the Confederacy and\r\nopening the Mississippi Valley down to the Gulf.\r\n\r\nAs it turned out, the Western forces accomplished their task first,\r\nvindicating the military powers of union soldiers and shaking the\r\nconfidence of opposing commanders. In February, 1862, Grant captured\r\nFort Donelson on the Tennessee River, rallied wavering unionists in\r\nKentucky, forced the evacuation of Nashville, and opened the way for two\r\nhundred miles into the Confederacy. At Shiloh, Murfreesboro, Vicksburg,\r\nChickamauga, Chattanooga, desperate fighting followed and, in spite of\r\nvarying fortunes, it resulted in the discomfiture and retirement of\r\nConfederate forces to the Southeast into Georgia. By the middle of 1863,\r\nthe Mississippi Valley was open to the Gulf, the initiative taken out of\r\nthe hands of Southern commanders in the West, and the way prepared for\r\nSherman's final stroke--the march from Atlanta to the sea--a maneuver\r\nexecuted with needless severity in the autumn of 1864.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL ULYSSES S. GRANT]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE]\r\n\r\nFor the almost unbroken succession of achievements in the West by\r\nGenerals Grant, Sherman, Thomas, and Hooker against Albert Sidney\r\nJohnston, Bragg, Pemberton, and Hood, the union forces in the East\r\noffered at first an almost equally unbroken series of misfortunes and\r\ndisasters. Far from capturing Richmond, they had been thrown on the\r\ndefensive. General after general--McClellan, Pope, Burnside, Hooker, and\r\nMeade--was tried and found wanting. None of them could administer a\r\ncrushing defeat to the Confederate troops and more than once the union\r\nsoldiers were beaten in a fair battle. They did succeed, however, in\r\ndelivering a severe check to advancing Confederates under General Robert\r\nE. Lee, first at Antietam in September, 1862, and then at Gettysburg in\r\nJuly, 1863--checks reckoned as victories though in each instance the\r\nConfederates escaped without demoralization. Not until the beginning of\r\nthe next year, when General Grant, supplied with almost unlimited men\r\nand munitions, began his irresistible hammering at Lee's army, did the\r\nfinal phase of the war commence. The pitiless drive told at last.\r\nGeneral Lee, on April 9, 1865, seeing the futility of further conflict,\r\nsurrendered an army still capable of hard fighting, at Appomattox, not\r\nfar from the capital of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nTHE FEDERAL MILITARY HOSPITAL AT GETTYSBURG]\r\n\r\n=Abraham Lincoln.=--The services of Lincoln to the cause of union defy\r\ndescription. A judicial scrutiny of the war reveals his thought and\r\nplanning in every part of the varied activity that finally crowned\r\nNorthern arms with victory. Is it in the field of diplomacy? Does\r\nSeward, the Secretary of State, propose harsh and caustic measures\r\nlikely to draw England's sword into the scale? Lincoln counsels\r\nmoderation. He takes the irritating message and with his own hand\r\nstrikes out, erases, tones down, and interlines, exchanging for words\r\nthat sting and burn the language of prudence and caution. Is it a matter\r\nof compromise with the South, so often proposed by men on both sides\r\nsick of carnage? Lincoln is always ready to listen and turns away only\r\nwhen he is invited to surrender principles essential to the safety of\r\nthe union. Is it high strategy of war, a question of the general best\r\nfitted to win Gettysburg--Hooker, Sedgwick, or Meade? Lincoln goes in\r\nperson to the War Department in the dead of night to take counsel with\r\nhis Secretary and to make the fateful choice.\r\n\r\nIs it a complaint from a citizen, deprived, as he believes, of his civil\r\nliberties unjustly or in violation of the Constitution? Lincoln is ready\r\nto hear it and anxious to afford relief, if warrant can be found for it.\r\nIs a mother begging for the life of a son sentenced to be shot as a\r\ndeserter? Lincoln hears her petition, and grants it even against the\r\nprotests made by his generals in the name of military discipline. Do\r\npoliticians sow dissensions in the army and among civilians? Lincoln\r\ngrandly waves aside their petty personalities and invites them to think\r\nof the greater cause. Is it a question of securing votes to ratify the\r\nthirteenth amendment abolishing slavery? Lincoln thinks it not beneath\r\nhis dignity to traffic and huckster with politicians over the trifling\r\njobs asked in return by the members who hold out against him. Does a New\r\nYork newspaper call him an ignorant Western boor? Lincoln's reply is a\r\nletter to a mother who has given her all--her sons on the field of\r\nbattle--and an address at Gettysburg, both of which will live as long as\r\nthe tongue in which they were written. These are tributes not only to\r\nhis mastery of the English language but also to his mastery of all those\r\nsentiments of sweetness and strength which are the finest flowers of\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire span of service, however, Lincoln was beset by\r\nmerciless critics. The fiery apostles of abolition accused him of\r\ncowardice when he delayed the bold stroke at slavery. Anti-war Democrats\r\nlashed out at every step he took. Even in his own party he found no\r\npeace. Charles Sumner complained: \"Our President is now dictator,\r\n_imperator_--whichever you like; but how vain to have the power of a\r\ngod and not to use it godlike.\" Leaders among the Republicans sought to\r\nput him aside in 1864 and place Chase in his chair. \"I hope we may never\r\nhave a worse man,\" was Lincoln's quiet answer.\r\n\r\nWide were the dissensions in the North during that year and the\r\nRepublicans, while selecting Lincoln as their candidate again, cast off\r\ntheir old name and chose the simple title of the \"Union party.\"\r\nMoreover, they selected a Southern man, Andrew Johnson, of Tennessee, to\r\nbe associated with him as candidate for Vice President. This combination\r\nthe Northern Democrats boldly confronted with a platform declaring that\r\n\"after four years of failure to restore the union by the experiment of\r\nwar, during which, under the pretence of military necessity or war power\r\nhigher than the Constitution, the Constitution itself has been\r\ndisregarded in every part and public liberty and private right alike\r\ntrodden down ... justice, humanity, liberty, and public welfare demand\r\nthat immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, to the\r\nend that peace may be restored on the basis of the federal union of the\r\nstates.\" It is true that the Democratic candidate, General McClellan,\r\nsought to break the yoke imposed upon him by the platform, saying that\r\nhe could not look his old comrades in the face and pronounce their\r\nefforts vain; but the party call to the nation to repudiate Lincoln and\r\nhis works had gone forth. The response came, giving Lincoln 2,200,000\r\nvotes against 1,800,000 for his opponent. The bitter things said about\r\nhim during the campaign, he forgot and forgave. When in April, 1865, he\r\nwas struck down by the assassin's hand, he above all others in\r\nWashington was planning measures of moderation and healing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nThere is a strong and natural tendency on the part of writers to stress\r\nthe dramatic and heroic aspects of war; but the long judgment of history\r\nrequires us to include all other significant phases as well. Like every\r\ngreat armed conflict, the Civil War outran the purposes of those who\r\ntook part in it. Waged over the nature of the union, it made a\r\nrevolution in the union, changing public policies and constitutional\r\nprinciples and giving a new direction to agriculture and industry.\r\n\r\n=The Supremacy of the Union.=--First and foremost, the war settled for\r\nall time the long dispute as to the nature of the federal system. The\r\ndoctrine of state sovereignty was laid to rest. Men might still speak of\r\nthe rights of states and think of their commonwealths with affection,\r\nbut nullification and secession were destroyed. The nation was supreme.\r\n\r\n=The Destruction of the Slave Power.=--Next to the vindication of\r\nnational supremacy was the destruction of the planting aristocracy of\r\nthe South--that great power which had furnished leadership of undoubted\r\nability and had so long contested with the industrial and commercial\r\ninterests of the North. The first paralyzing blow at the planters was\r\nstruck by the abolition of slavery. The second and third came with the\r\nfourteenth (1868) and fifteenth (1870) amendments, giving the ballot to\r\nfreedmen and excluding from public office the Confederate\r\nleaders--driving from the work of reconstruction the finest talents of\r\nthe South. As if to add bitterness to gall and wormwood, the fourteenth\r\namendment forbade the United States or any state to pay any debts\r\nincurred in aid of the Confederacy or in the emancipation of the\r\nslaves--plunging into utter bankruptcy the Southern financiers who had\r\nstripped their section of capital to support their cause. So the\r\nSouthern planters found themselves excluded from public office and ruled\r\nover by their former bondmen under the tutelage of Republican leaders.\r\nTheir labor system was wrecked and their money and bonds were as\r\nworthless as waste paper. The South was subject to the North. That which\r\nneither the Federalists nor the Whigs had been able to accomplish in the\r\nrealm of statecraft was accomplished on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n=The Triumph of Industry.=--The wreck of the planting system was\r\naccompanied by a mighty upswing of Northern industry which made the old\r\nWhigs of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania stare in wonderment. The demands\r\nof the federal government for manufactured goods at unrestricted prices\r\ngave a stimulus to business which more than replaced the lost markets of\r\nthe South. Between 1860 and 1870 the number of manufacturing\r\nestablishments increased 79.6 per cent as against 14.2 for the previous\r\ndecade; while the number of persons employed almost doubled. There was\r\nno doubt about the future of American industry.\r\n\r\n=The Victory for the Protective Tariff.=--Moreover, it was henceforth to\r\nbe well protected. For many years before the war the friends of\r\nprotection had been on the defensive. The tariff act of 1857 imposed\r\nduties so low as to presage a tariff for revenue only. The war changed\r\nall that. The extraordinary military expenditures, requiring heavy taxes\r\non all sources, justified tariffs so high that a follower of Clay or\r\nWebster might well have gasped with astonishment. After the war was over\r\nthe debt remained and both interest and principal had to be paid.\r\nProtective arguments based on economic reasoning were supported by a\r\nplain necessity for revenue which admitted no dispute.\r\n\r\n=A Liberal Immigration Policy.=--Linked with industry was the labor\r\nsupply. The problem of manning industries became a pressing matter, and\r\nRepublican leaders grappled with it. In the platform of the Union party\r\nadopted in 1864 it was declared \"that foreign immigration, which in the\r\npast has added so much to the wealth, the development of resources, and\r\nthe increase of power to this nation--the asylum of the oppressed of all\r\nnations--should be fostered and encouraged by a liberal and just\r\npolicy.\" In that very year Congress, recognizing the importance of the\r\nproblem, passed a measure of high significance, creating a bureau of\r\nimmigration, and authorizing a modified form of indentured labor, by\r\nmaking it legal for immigrants to pledge their wages in advance to pay\r\ntheir passage over. Though the bill was soon repealed, the practice\r\nauthorized by it was long continued. The cheapness of the passage\r\nshortened the term of service; but the principle was older than the\r\ndays of William Penn.\r\n\r\n=The Homestead Act of 1862.=--In the immigration measure guaranteeing a\r\ncontinuous and adequate labor supply, the manufacturers saw an offset to\r\nthe Homestead Act of 1862 granting free lands to settlers. The Homestead\r\nlaw they had resisted in a long and bitter congressional battle.\r\nNaturally, they had not taken kindly to a scheme which lured men away\r\nfrom the factories or enabled them to make unlimited demands for higher\r\nwages as the price of remaining. Southern planters likewise had feared\r\nfree homesteads for the very good reason that they only promised to add\r\nto the overbalancing power of the North.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the opposition, supporters of a liberal land policy made\r\nsteady gains. Free-soil Democrats,--Jacksonian farmers and\r\nmechanics,--labor reformers, and political leaders, like Stephen A.\r\nDouglas of Illinois and Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, kept up the\r\nagitation in season and out. More than once were they able to force a\r\nhomestead bill through the House of Representatives only to have it\r\nblocked in the Senate where Southern interests were intrenched. Then,\r\nafter the Senate was won over, a Democratic President, James Buchanan,\r\nvetoed the bill. Still the issue lived. The Republicans, strong among\r\nthe farmers of the Northwest, favored it from the beginning and pressed\r\nit upon the attention of the country. Finally the manufacturers yielded;\r\nthey received their compensation in the contract labor law. In 1862\r\nCongress provided for the free distribution of land in 160-acre lots\r\namong men and women of strong arms and willing hearts ready to build\r\ntheir serried lines of homesteads to the Rockies and beyond.\r\n\r\n=Internal Improvements.=--If farmers and manufacturers were early\r\ndivided on the matter of free homesteads, the same could hardly be said\r\nof internal improvements. The Western tiller of the soil was as eager\r\nfor some easy way of sending his produce to market as the manufacturer\r\nwas for the same means to transport his goods to the consumer on the\r\nfarm. While the Confederate leaders were writing into their\r\nconstitution a clause forbidding all appropriations for internal\r\nimprovements, the Republican leaders at Washington were planning such\r\nexpenditures from the treasury in the form of public land grants to\r\nrailways as would have dazed the authors of the national road bill half\r\na century earlier.\r\n\r\n=Sound Finance--National Banking.=--From Hamilton's day to Lincoln's,\r\nbusiness men in the East had contended for a sound system of national\r\ncurrency. The experience of the states with paper money, painfully\r\nimpressive in the years before the framing of the Constitution, had been\r\nconvincing to those who understood the economy of business. The\r\nConstitution, as we have seen, bore the signs of this experience. States\r\nwere forbidden to emit bills of credit: paper money, in short. This\r\nprovision stood clear in the document; but judicial ingenuity had\r\ncircumvented it in the age of Jacksonian Democracy. The states had\r\nenacted and the Supreme Court, after the death of John Marshall, had\r\nsustained laws chartering banking companies and authorizing them to\r\nissue paper money. So the country was beset by the old curse, the banks\r\nof Western and Southern states issuing reams of paper notes to help\r\nborrowers pay their debts.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with war finances, the Republicans attacked this ancient\r\nevil. By act of Congress in 1864, they authorized a series of national\r\nbanks founded on the credit of government bonds and empowered to issue\r\nnotes. The next year they stopped all bank paper sent forth under the\r\nauthority of the states by means of a prohibitive tax. In this way, by\r\ntwo measures Congress restored federal control over the monetary system\r\nalthough it did not reëstablish the United States Bank so hated by\r\nJacksonian Democracy.\r\n\r\n=Destruction of States' Rights by Fourteenth Amendment.=--These acts and\r\nothers not cited here were measures of centralization and consolidation\r\nat the expense of the powers and dignity of the states. They were all of\r\nhigh import, but the crowning act of nationalism was the fourteenth\r\namendment which, among other things, forbade states to \"deprive any\r\nperson of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" The\r\nimmediate occasion, though not the actual cause of this provision, was\r\nthe need for protecting the rights of freedmen against hostile\r\nlegislatures in the South. The result of the amendment, as was\r\nprophesied in protests loud and long from every quarter of the\r\nDemocratic party, was the subjection of every act of state, municipal,\r\nand county authorities to possible annulment by the Supreme Court at\r\nWashington. The expected happened.\r\n\r\nFew negroes ever brought cases under the fourteenth amendment to the\r\nattention of the courts; but thousands of state laws, municipal\r\nordinances, and acts of local authorities were set aside as null and\r\nvoid under it. Laws of states regulating railway rates, fixing hours of\r\nlabor in bakeshops, and taxing corporations were in due time to be\r\nannulled as conflicting with an amendment erroneously supposed to be\r\ndesigned solely for the protection of negroes. As centralized power over\r\ntariffs, railways, public lands, and other national concerns went to\r\nCongress, so centralized power over the acts of state and local\r\nauthorities involving an infringement of personal and property rights\r\nwas conferred on the federal judiciary, the apex of which was the\r\nSupreme Court at Washington. Thus the old federation of \"independent\r\nstates,\" all equal in rights and dignity, each wearing the \"jewel of\r\nsovereignty\" so celebrated in Southern oratory, had gone the way of all\r\nflesh under the withering blasts of Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION IN THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n=Theories about the Position of the Seceded States.=--On the morning of\r\nApril 9, 1865, when General Lee surrendered his army to General Grant,\r\neleven states stood in a peculiar relation to the union now declared\r\nperpetual. Lawyers and political philosophers were much perturbed and\r\nhad been for some time as to what should be done with the members of the\r\nformer Confederacy. Radical Republicans held that they were \"conquered\r\nprovinces\" at the mercy of Congress, to be governed under such laws as\r\nit saw fit to enact and until in its wisdom it decided to readmit any or\r\nall of them to the union. Men of more conservative views held that, as\r\nthe war had been waged by the North on the theory that no state could\r\nsecede from the union, the Confederate states had merely attempted to\r\nwithdraw and had failed. The corollary of this latter line of argument\r\nwas simple: \"The Southern states are still in the union and it is the\r\nduty of the President, as commander-in-chief, to remove the federal\r\ntroops as soon as order is restored and the state governments ready to\r\nfunction once more as usual.\"\r\n\r\n=Lincoln's Proposal.=--Some such simple and conservative form of\r\nreconstruction had been suggested by Lincoln in a proclamation of\r\nDecember 8, 1863. He proposed pardon and a restoration of property,\r\nexcept in slaves, to nearly all who had \"directly or by implication\r\nparticipated in the existing rebellion,\" on condition that they take an\r\noath of loyalty to the union. He then announced that when, in any of the\r\nstates named, a body of voters, qualified under the law as it stood\r\nbefore secession and equal in number to one-tenth the votes cast in\r\n1860, took the oath of allegiance, they should be permitted to\r\nreëstablish a state government. Such a government, he added, should be\r\nrecognized as a lawful authority and entitled to protection under the\r\nfederal Constitution. With reference to the status of the former slaves\r\nLincoln made it clear that, while their freedom must be recognized, he\r\nwould not object to any legislation \"which may yet be consistent as a\r\ntemporary arrangement with their present condition as a laboring,\r\nlandless, and homeless class.\"\r\n\r\n=Andrew Johnson's Plan--His Impeachment.=--Lincoln's successor, Andrew\r\nJohnson, the Vice President, soon after taking office, proposed to\r\npursue a somewhat similar course. In a number of states he appointed\r\nmilitary governors, instructing them at the earliest possible moment to\r\nassemble conventions, chosen \"by that portion of the people of the said\r\nstates who are loyal to the United States,\" and proceed to the\r\norganization of regular civil government. Johnson, a Southern man and a\r\nDemocrat, was immediately charged by the Republicans with being too\r\nready to restore the Southern states. As the months went by, the\r\nopposition to his measures and policies in Congress grew in size and\r\nbitterness. The contest resulted in the impeachment of Johnson by the\r\nHouse of Representatives in March, 1868, and his acquittal by the Senate\r\nmerely because his opponents lacked one vote of the two-thirds required\r\nfor conviction.\r\n\r\n=Congress Enacts \"Reconstruction Laws.\"=--In fact, Congress was in a\r\nstrategic position. It was the law-making body, and it could, moreover,\r\ndetermine the conditions under which Senators and Representatives from\r\nthe South were to be readmitted. It therefore proceeded to pass a series\r\nof reconstruction acts--carrying all of them over Johnson's veto. These\r\nmeasures, the first of which became a law on March 2, 1867, betrayed an\r\nanimus not found anywhere in Lincoln's plans or Johnson's proclamations.\r\n\r\nThey laid off the ten states--the whole Confederacy with the exception\r\nof Tennessee--still outside the pale, into five military districts, each\r\ncommanded by a military officer appointed by the President. They ordered\r\nthe commanding general to prepare a register of voters for the election\r\nof delegates to conventions chosen for the purpose of drafting new\r\nconstitutions. Such voters, however, were not to be, as Lincoln had\r\nsuggested, loyal persons duly qualified under the law existing before\r\nsecession but \"the male citizens of said state, twenty-one years old and\r\nupward, of whatever race, color, or previous condition, ... except such\r\nas may be disfranchised for participation in the rebellion or for felony\r\nat common law.\" This was the death knell to the idea that the leaders of\r\nthe Confederacy and their white supporters might be permitted to share\r\nin the establishment of the new order. Power was thus arbitrarily thrust\r\ninto the hands of the newly emancipated male negroes and the handful of\r\nwhites who could show a record of loyalty. That was not all. Each state\r\nwas, under the reconstruction acts, compelled to ratify the fourteenth\r\namendment to the federal Constitution as a price of restoration to the\r\nunion.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the conventions thus authorized may be imagined.\r\nBondmen without the asking and without preparation found themselves the\r\ngoverning power. An army of adventurers from the North, \"carpet baggers\"\r\nas they were called, poured in upon the scene to aid in\r\n\"reconstruction.\" Undoubtedly many men of honor and fine intentions gave\r\nunstinted service, but the results of their deliberations only\r\naggravated the open wound left by the war. Any number of political\r\ndoctors offered their prescriptions; but no effective remedy could be\r\nfound. Under measures admittedly open to grave objections, the Southern\r\nstates were one after another restored to the union by the grace of\r\nCongress, the last one in 1870. Even this grudging concession of the\r\nformalities of statehood did not mean a full restoration of honors and\r\nprivileges. The last soldier was not withdrawn from the last Southern\r\ncapital until 1877, and federal control over elections long remained as\r\na sign of congressional supremacy.\r\n\r\n=The Status of the Freedmen.=--Even more intricate than the issues\r\ninvolved in restoring the seceded states to the union was the question\r\nof what to do with the newly emancipated slaves. That problem, often put\r\nto abolitionists before the war, had become at last a real concern. The\r\nthirteenth amendment abolishing slavery had not touched it at all. It\r\ndeclared bondmen free, but did nothing to provide them with work or\r\nhomes and did not mention the subject of political rights. All these\r\nmatters were left to the states, and the legislatures of some of them,\r\nby their famous \"black codes,\" restored a form of servitude under the\r\nguise of vagrancy and apprentice laws. Such methods were in fact partly\r\nresponsible for the reaction that led Congress to abandon Lincoln's\r\npolicies and undertake its own program of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nStill no extensive effort was made to solve by law the economic problems\r\nof the bondmen. Radical abolitionists had advocated that the slaves when\r\nemancipated should be given outright the fields of their former\r\nmasters; but Congress steadily rejected the very idea of confiscation.\r\nThe necessity of immediate assistance it recognized by creating in 1865\r\nthe Freedmen's Bureau to take care of refugees. It authorized the issue\r\nof food and clothing to the destitute and the renting of abandoned and\r\ncertain other lands under federal control to former slaves at reasonable\r\nrates. But the larger problem of the relation of the freedmen to the\r\nland, it left to the slow working of time.\r\n\r\nAgainst sharp protests from conservative men, particularly among the\r\nDemocrats, Congress did insist, however, on conferring upon the freedmen\r\ncertain rights by national law. These rights fell into broad divisions,\r\ncivil and political. By an act passed in 1866, Congress gave to former\r\nslaves the rights of white citizens in the matter of making contracts,\r\ngiving testimony in courts, and purchasing, selling, and leasing\r\nproperty. As it was doubtful whether Congress had the power to enact\r\nthis law, there was passed and submitted to the states the fourteenth\r\namendment which gave citizenship to the freedmen, assured them of the\r\nprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, and declared\r\nthat no state should deprive any person of his life, liberty, or\r\nproperty without due process of law. Not yet satisfied, Congress\r\nattempted to give social equality to negroes by the second civil rights\r\nbill of 1875 which promised to them, among other things, the full and\r\nequal enjoyment of inns, theaters, public conveyances, and places of\r\namusement--a law later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe matter of political rights was even more hotly contested; but the\r\nradical Republicans, like Charles Sumner, asserted that civil rights\r\nwere not secure unless supported by the suffrage. In this same\r\nfourteenth amendment they attempted to guarantee the ballot to all negro\r\nmen, leaving the women to take care of themselves. The amendment\r\ndeclared in effect that when any state deprived adult male citizens of\r\nthe right to vote, its representation in Congress should be reduced in\r\nthe proportion such persons bore to the voting population.\r\n\r\nThis provision having failed to accomplish its purpose, the fifteenth\r\namendment was passed and ratified, expressly declaring that no citizen\r\nshould be deprived of the right to vote \"on account of race, color, or\r\nprevious condition of servitude.\" To make assurance doubly secure,\r\nCongress enacted in 1870, 1872, and 1873 three drastic laws, sometimes\r\nknown as \"force bills,\" providing for the use of federal authorities,\r\ncivil and military, in supervising elections in all parts of the Union.\r\nSo the federal government, having destroyed chattel slavery, sought by\r\nlegal decree to sweep away all its signs and badges, civil, social, and\r\npolitical. Never, save perhaps in some of the civil conflicts of Greece\r\nor Rome, had there occurred in the affairs of a nation a social\r\nrevolution so complete, so drastic, and far-reaching in its results.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF THE SECTIONAL CONFLICT\r\n\r\nJust as the United States, under the impetus of Western enterprise,\r\nrounded out the continental domain, its very existence as a nation was\r\nchallenged by a fratricidal conflict between two sections. This storm\r\nhad been long gathering upon the horizon. From the very beginning in\r\ncolonial times there had been a marked difference between the South and\r\nthe North. The former by climate and soil was dedicated to a planting\r\nsystem--the cultivation of tobacco, rice, cotton, and sugar cane--and in\r\nthe course of time slave labor became the foundation of the system. The\r\nNorth, on the other hand, supplemented agriculture by commerce, trade,\r\nand manufacturing. Slavery, though lawful, did not flourish there. An\r\nabundant supply of free labor kept the Northern wheels turning.\r\n\r\nThis difference between the two sections, early noted by close\r\nobservers, was increased with the advent of the steam engine and the\r\nfactory system. Between 1815 and 1860 an industrial revolution took\r\nplace in the North. Its signs were gigantic factories, huge aggregations\r\nof industrial workers, immense cities, a flourishing commerce, and\r\nprosperous banks. Finding an unfavorable reception in the South, the new\r\nindustrial system was confined mainly to the North. By canals and\r\nrailways New York, Boston, and Philadelphia were linked with the\r\nwheatfields of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. A steel net wove North and\r\nNorthwest together. A commercial net supplemented it. Western trade was\r\ndiverted from New Orleans to the East and Eastern credit sustained\r\nWestern enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn time, the industrial North and the planting South evolved different\r\nideas of political policy. The former looked with favor on protective\r\ntariffs, ship subsidies, a sound national banking system, and internal\r\nimprovements. The farmers of the West demanded that the public domain be\r\ndivided up into free homesteads for farmers. The South steadily swung\r\naround to the opposite view. Its spokesmen came to regard most of these\r\npolicies as injurious to the planting interests.\r\n\r\nThe economic questions were all involved in a moral issue. The Northern\r\nstates, in which slavery was of slight consequence, had early abolished\r\nthe institution. In the course of a few years there appeared\r\nuncompromising advocates of universal emancipation. Far and wide the\r\nagitation spread. The South was thoroughly frightened. It demanded\r\nprotection against the agitators, the enforcement of its rights in the\r\ncase of runaway slaves, and equal privileges for slavery in the new\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nWith the passing years the conflict between the two sections increased\r\nin bitterness. It flamed up in 1820 and was allayed by the Missouri\r\ncompromise. It took on the form of a tariff controversy and\r\nnullification in 1832. It appeared again after the Mexican war when the\r\nquestion of slavery in the new territories was raised. Again\r\ncompromise--the great settlement of 1850--seemed to restore peace, only\r\nto prove an illusion. A series of startling events swept the country\r\ninto war: the repeal of the Missouri compromise in 1854, the rise of the\r\nRepublican party pledged to the prohibition of slavery in the\r\nterritories, the Dred Scott decision of 1857, the Lincoln-Douglas\r\ndebates, John Brown's raid, the election of Lincoln, and secession.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War, lasting for four years, tested the strength of both North\r\nand South, in leadership, in finance, in diplomatic skill, in material\r\nresources, in industry, and in armed forces. By the blockade of Southern\r\nports, by an overwhelming weight of men and materials, and by relentless\r\nhammering on the field of battle, the North was victorious.\r\n\r\nThe results of the war were revolutionary in character. Slavery was\r\nabolished and the freedmen given the ballot. The Southern planters who\r\nhad been the leaders of their section were ruined financially and almost\r\nto a man excluded from taking part in political affairs. The union was\r\ndeclared to be perpetual and the right of a state to secede settled by\r\nthe judgment of battle. Federal control over the affairs of states,\r\ncounties, and cities was established by the fourteenth amendment. The\r\npower and prestige of the federal government were enhanced beyond\r\nimagination. The North was now free to pursue its economic policies: a\r\nprotective tariff, a national banking system, land grants for railways,\r\nfree lands for farmers. Planting had dominated the country for nearly a\r\ngeneration. Business enterprise was to take its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nNORTHERN ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\nJ.K.

NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION OF THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the Civil War in the South was nothing short of a\r\nrevolution. The ruling class, the law, and the government of the old\r\norder had been subverted. To political chaos was added the havoc wrought\r\nin agriculture, business, and transportation by military operations. And\r\nas if to fill the cup to the brim, the task of reconstruction was\r\ncommitted to political leaders from another section of the country,\r\nstrangers to the life and traditions of the South.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n=A Ruling Class Disfranchised.=--As the sovereignty of the planters had\r\nbeen the striking feature of the old régime, so their ruin was the\r\noutstanding fact of the new. The situation was extraordinary. The\r\nAmerican Revolution was carried out by people experienced in the arts of\r\nself-government, and at its close they were free to follow the general\r\ncourse to which they had long been accustomed. The French Revolution\r\nwitnessed the overthrow of the clergy and the nobility; but middle\r\nclasses who took their places had been steadily rising in intelligence\r\nand wealth.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Revolution was unlike either of these cataclysms. It was\r\nnot brought about by a social upheaval, but by an external crisis. It\r\ndid not enfranchise a class that sought and understood power, but\r\nbondmen who had played no part in the struggle. Moreover it struck down\r\na class equipped to rule. The leading planters were almost to a man\r\nexcluded from state and federal offices, and the fourteenth amendment\r\nwas a bar to their return. All civil and military places under the\r\nauthority of the United States and of the states were closed to every\r\nman who had taken an oath to support the Constitution as a member of\r\nCongress, as a state legislator, or as a state or federal officer, and\r\nafterward engaged in \"insurrection or rebellion,\" or \"given aid and\r\ncomfort to the enemies\" of the United States. This sweeping provision,\r\nsupplemented by the reconstruction acts, laid under the ban most of the\r\ntalent, energy, and spirit of the South.\r\n\r\n=The Condition of the State Governments.=--The legislative, executive,\r\nand judicial branches of the state governments thus passed into the\r\ncontrol of former slaves, led principally by Northern adventurers or\r\nSouthern novices, known as \"Scalawags.\" The result was a carnival of\r\nwaste, folly, and corruption. The \"reconstruction\" assembly of South\r\nCarolina bought clocks at $480 apiece and chandeliers at $650. To\r\npurchase land for former bondmen the sum of $800,000 was appropriated;\r\nand swamps bought at seventy-five cents an acre were sold to the state\r\nat five times the cost. In the years between 1868 and 1873, the debt of\r\nthe state rose from about $5,800,000 to $24,000,000, and millions of the\r\nincrease could not be accounted for by the authorities responsible for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Economic Ruin--Urban and Rural.=--No matter where Southern men turned\r\nin 1865 they found devastation--in the towns, in the country, and along\r\nthe highways. Atlanta, the city to which Sherman applied the torch, lay\r\nin ashes; Nashville and Chattanooga had been partially wrecked; Richmond\r\nand Augusta had suffered severely from fires. Charleston was described\r\nby a visitor as \"a city of ruins, of desolation, of vacant houses, of\r\nrotten wharves, of deserted warehouses, of weed gardens, of miles of\r\ngrass-grown streets.... How few young men there are, how generally the\r\nyoung women are dressed in black! The flower of their proud aristocracy\r\nis buried on scores of battle fields.\"\r\n\r\nThose who journeyed through the country about the same time reported\r\ndesolation equally widespread and equally pathetic. An English traveler\r\nwho made his way along the course of the Tennessee River in 1870 wrote:\r\n\"The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin\r\nhouses, ruined bridges, mills, and factories ... and large tracts of\r\nonce cultivated land are stripped of every vestige of fencing. The\r\nroads, long neglected, are in disorder and, having in many places become\r\nimpassable, new tracks have been made through the woods and fields\r\nwithout much respect to boundaries.\" Many a great plantation had been\r\nconfiscated by the federal authorities while the owner was in\r\nConfederate service. Many more lay in waste. In the wake of the armies\r\nthe homes of rich and poor alike, if spared the torch, had been\r\ndespoiled of the stock and seeds necessary to renew agriculture.\r\n\r\n=Railways Dilapidated.=--Transportation was still more demoralized. This\r\nis revealed in the pages of congressional reports based upon first-hand\r\ninvestigations. One eloquent passage illustrates all the rest. From\r\nPocahontas to Decatur, Alabama, a distance of 114 miles, we are told,\r\nthe railroad was \"almost entirely destroyed, except the road bed and\r\niron rails, and they were in a very bad condition--every bridge and\r\ntrestle destroyed, cross-ties rotten, buildings burned, water tanks\r\ngone, tracks grown up in weeds and bushes, not a saw mill near the line\r\nand the labor system of the country gone. About forty miles of the track\r\nwere burned, the cross-ties entirely destroyed, and the rails bent and\r\ntwisted in such a manner as to require great labor to straighten and a\r\nlarge portion of them requiring renewal.\"\r\n\r\n=Capital and Credit Destroyed.=--The fluid capital of the South, money\r\nand credit, was in the same prostrate condition as the material capital.\r\nThe Confederate currency, inflated to the bursting point, had utterly\r\ncollapsed and was as worthless as waste paper. The bonds of the\r\nConfederate government were equally valueless. Specie had nearly\r\ndisappeared from circulation. The fourteenth amendment to the federal\r\nConstitution had made all \"debts, obligations, and claims\" incurred in\r\naid of the Confederate cause \"illegal and void.\" Millions of dollars\r\nowed to Northern creditors before the war were overdue and payment was\r\npressed upon the debtors. Where such debts were secured by mortgages on\r\nland, executions against the property could be obtained in federal\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RESTORATION OF WHITE SUPREMACY\r\n\r\n=Intimidation.=--In both politics and economics, the process of\r\nreconstruction in the South was slow and arduous. The first battle in\r\nthe political contest for white supremacy was won outside the halls of\r\nlegislatures and the courts of law. It was waged, in the main, by secret\r\norganizations, among which the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia were\r\nthe most prominent. The first of these societies appeared in Tennessee\r\nin 1866 and held its first national convention the following year. It\r\nwas in origin a social club. According to its announcement, its objects\r\nwere \"to protect the weak, the innocent, and the defenceless from the\r\nindignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless, the violent, and the\r\nbrutal; and to succor the suffering, especially the widows and orphans\r\nof the Confederate soldiers.\" The whole South was called \"the Empire\"\r\nand was ruled by a \"Grand Wizard.\" Each state was a realm and each\r\ncounty a province. In the secret orders there were enrolled over half a\r\nmillion men.\r\n\r\nThe methods of the Ku Klux and the White Camelia were similar. Solemn\r\nparades of masked men on horses decked in long robes were held,\r\nsometimes in the daytime and sometimes at the dead of night. Notices\r\nwere sent to obnoxious persons warning them to stop certain practices.\r\nIf warning failed, something more convincing was tried. Fright was the\r\nemotion most commonly stirred. A horseman, at the witching hour of\r\nmidnight, would ride up to the house of some offender, lift his head\r\ngear, take off a skull, and hand it to the trembling victim with the\r\nrequest that he hold it for a few minutes. Frequently violence was\r\nemployed either officially or unofficially by members of the Klan. Tar\r\nand feathers were freely applied; the whip was sometimes laid on\r\nunmercifully, and occasionally a brutal murder was committed. Often the\r\nmembers were fired upon from bushes or behind trees, and swift\r\nretaliation followed. So alarming did the clashes become that in 1870\r\nCongress forbade interference with electors or going in disguise for the\r\npurpose of obstructing the exercise of the rights enjoyed under federal\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of such a step on the part of the federal government,\r\nthe Ku Klux was officially dissolved by the \"Grand Wizard\" in 1869.\r\nNevertheless, the local societies continued their organization and\r\nmethods. The spirit survived the national association. \"On the whole,\"\r\nsays a Southern writer, \"it is not easy to see what other course was\r\nopen to the South.... Armed resistance was out of the question. And yet\r\nthere must be some control had of the situation.... If force was denied,\r\ncraft was inevitable.\"\r\n\r\n=The Struggle for the Ballot Box.=--The effects of intimidation were\r\nsoon seen at elections. The freedman, into whose inexperienced hand the\r\nballot had been thrust, was ordinarily loath to risk his head by the\r\nexercise of his new rights. He had not attained them by a long and\r\nlaborious contest of his own and he saw no urgent reason why he should\r\nbattle for the privilege of using them. The mere show of force, the mere\r\nexistence of a threat, deterred thousands of ex-slaves from appearing at\r\nthe polls. Thus the whites steadily recovered their dominance. Nothing\r\ncould prevent it. Congress enacted force bills establishing federal\r\nsupervision of elections and the Northern politicians protested against\r\nthe return of former Confederates to practical, if not official, power;\r\nbut all such opposition was like resistance to the course of nature.\r\n\r\n=Amnesty for Southerners.=--The recovery of white supremacy in this way\r\nwas quickly felt in national councils. The Democratic party in the North\r\nwelcomed it as a sign of its return to power. The more moderate\r\nRepublicans, anxious to heal the breach in American unity, sought to\r\nencourage rather than to repress it. So it came about that amnesty for\r\nConfederates was widely advocated. Yet it must be said that the struggle\r\nfor the removal of disabilities was stubborn and bitter. Lincoln, with\r\ncharacteristic generosity, in the midst of the war had issued a general\r\nproclamation of amnesty to nearly all who had been in arms against the\r\nUnion, on condition that they take an oath of loyalty; but Johnson,\r\nvindictive toward Southern leaders and determined to make \"treason\r\ninfamous,\" had extended the list of exceptions. Congress, even more\r\nrelentless in its pursuit of Confederates, pushed through the fourteenth\r\namendment which worked the sweeping disabilities we have just described.\r\n\r\nTo appeals for comprehensive clemency, Congress was at first adamant. In\r\nvain did men like Carl Schurz exhort their colleagues to crown their\r\nvictory in battle with a noble act of universal pardon and oblivion.\r\nCongress would not yield. It would grant amnesty in individual cases;\r\nfor the principle of proscription it stood fast. When finally in 1872,\r\nseven years after the surrender at Appomattox, it did pass the general\r\namnesty bill, it insisted on certain exceptions. Confederates who had\r\nbeen members of Congress just before the war, or had served in other\r\nhigh posts, civil or military, under the federal government, were still\r\nexcluded from important offices. Not until the summer of 1898, when the\r\nwar with Spain produced once more a union of hearts, did Congress relent\r\nand abolish the last of the disabilities imposed on the Confederates.\r\n\r\n=The Force Bills Attacked and Nullified.=--The granting of amnesty\r\nencouraged the Democrats to redouble their efforts all along the line.\r\nIn 1874 they captured the House of Representatives and declared war on\r\nthe \"force bills.\" As a Republican Senate blocked immediate repeal, they\r\nresorted to an ingenious parliamentary trick. To the appropriation bill\r\nfor the support of the army they attached a \"rider,\" or condition, to\r\nthe effect that no troops should be used to sustain the Republican\r\ngovernment in Louisiana. The Senate rejected the proposal. A deadlock\r\nensued and Congress adjourned without making provision for the army.\r\nSatisfied with the technical victory, the Democrats let the army bill\r\npass the next session, but kept up their fight on the force laws until\r\nthey wrung from President Hayes a measure forbidding the use of United\r\nStates troops in supervising elections. The following year they again\r\nhad recourse to a rider on the army bill and carried it through, putting\r\nan end to the use of money for military control of elections. The\r\nreconstruction program was clearly going to pieces, and the Supreme\r\nCourt helped along the process of dissolution by declaring parts of the\r\nlaws invalid. In 1878 the Democrats even won a majority in the Senate\r\nand returned to power a large number of men once prominent in the\r\nConfederate cause.\r\n\r\nThe passions of the war by this time were evidently cooling. A new\r\ngeneration of men was coming on the scene. The supremacy of the whites\r\nin the South, if not yet complete, was at least assured. Federal\r\nmarshals, their deputies, and supervisors of elections still possessed\r\nauthority over the polls, but their strength had been shorn by the\r\nwithdrawal of United States troops. The war on the remaining remnants of\r\nthe \"force bills\" lapsed into desultory skirmishing. When in 1894 the\r\nlast fragment was swept away, the country took little note of the fact.\r\nThe only task that lay before the Southern leaders was to write in the\r\nconstitutions of their respective states the provisions of law which\r\nwould clinch the gains so far secured and establish white supremacy\r\nbeyond the reach of outside intervention.\r\n\r\n=White Supremacy Sealed by New State Constitutions.=--The impetus to\r\nthis final step was given by the rise of the Populist movement in the\r\nSouth, which sharply divided the whites and in many communities threw\r\nthe balance of power into the hands of the few colored voters who\r\nsurvived the process of intimidation. Southern leaders now devised new\r\nconstitutions so constructed as to deprive negroes of the ballot by law.\r\nMississippi took the lead in 1890; South Carolina followed five years\r\nlater; Louisiana, in 1898; North Carolina, in 1900; Alabama and\r\nMaryland, in 1901; and Virginia, in 1902.\r\n\r\nThe authors of these measures made no attempt to conceal their purposes.\r\n\"The intelligent white men of the South,\" said Governor Tillman, \"intend\r\nto govern here.\" The fifteenth amendment to the federal Constitution,\r\nhowever, forbade them to deprive any citizen of the right to vote on\r\naccount of race, color, or previous condition of servitude. This made\r\nnecessary the devices of indirection. They were few, simple, and\r\neffective. The first and most easily administered was the ingenious\r\nprovision requiring each prospective voter to read a section of the\r\nstate constitution or \"understand and explain it\" when read to him by\r\nthe election officers. As an alternative, the payment of taxes or the\r\nownership of a small amount of property was accepted as a qualification\r\nfor voting. Southern leaders, unwilling to disfranchise any of the poor\r\nwhite men who had stood side by side with them \"in the dark days of\r\nreconstruction,\" also resorted to a famous provision known as \"the\r\ngrandfather clause.\" This plan admitted to the suffrage any man who did\r\nnot have either property or educational qualifications, provided he had\r\nvoted on or before 1867 or was the son or grandson of any such person.\r\n\r\nThe devices worked effectively. Of the 147,000 negroes in Mississippi\r\nabove the age of twenty-one, only about 8600 registered under the\r\nconstitution of 1890. Louisiana had 127,000 colored voters enrolled in\r\n1896; under the constitution drafted two years later the registration\r\nfell to 5300. An analysis of the figures for South Carolina in 1900\r\nindicates that only about one negro out of every hundred adult males of\r\nthat race took part in elections. Thus was closed this chapter of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\n=The Supreme Court Refuses to Intervene.=--Numerous efforts were made to\r\nprevail upon the Supreme Court of the United States to declare such laws\r\nunconstitutional; but the Court, usually on technical grounds, avoided\r\ncoming to a direct decision on the merits of the matter. In one case\r\nthe Court remarked that it could not take charge of and operate the\r\nelection machinery of Alabama; it concluded that \"relief from a great\r\npolitical wrong, if done as alleged, by the people of a state and by the\r\nstate itself, must be given by them, or by the legislative and executive\r\ndepartments of the government of the United States.\" Only one of the\r\nseveral schemes employed, namely, the \"grandfather clause,\" was held to\r\nbe a violation of the federal Constitution. This blow, effected in 1915\r\nby the decision in the Oklahoma and Maryland cases, left, however, the\r\nmain structure of disfranchisement unimpaired.\r\n\r\n=Proposals to Reduce Southern Representation in Congress.=--These\r\nprovisions excluding thousands of male citizens from the ballot did not,\r\nin express terms, deprive any one of the vote on account of race or\r\ncolor. They did not, therefore, run counter to the letter of the\r\nfifteenth amendment; but they did unquestionably make the states which\r\nadopted them liable to the operations of the fourteenth amendment. The\r\nlatter very explicitly provides that whenever any state deprives adult\r\nmale citizens of the right to vote (except in certain minor cases) the\r\nrepresentation of the state in Congress shall be reduced in the\r\nproportion which such number of disfranchised citizens bears to the\r\nwhole number of male citizens over twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nMindful of this provision, those who protested against disfranchisement\r\nin the South turned to the Republican party for relief, asking for\r\naction by the political branches of the federal government as the\r\nSupreme Court had suggested. The Republicans responded in their platform\r\nof 1908 by condemning all devices designed to deprive any one of the\r\nballot for reasons of color alone; they demanded the enforcement in\r\nletter and spirit of the fourteenth as well as all other amendments.\r\nThough victorious in the election, the Republicans refrained from\r\nreopening the ancient contest; they made no attempt to reduce Southern\r\nrepresentation in the House. Southern leaders, while protesting against\r\nthe declarations of their opponents, were able to view them as idle\r\nthreats in no way endangering the security of the measures by which\r\npolitical reconstruction had been undone.\r\n\r\n=The Solid South.=--Out of the thirty-year conflict against \"carpet-bag\r\nrule\" there emerged what was long known as the \"solid South\"--a South\r\nthat, except occasionally in the border states, never gave an electoral\r\nvote to a Republican candidate for President. Before the Civil War, the\r\nSouthern people had been divided on political questions. Take, for\r\nexample, the election of 1860. In all the fifteen slave states the\r\nvariety of opinion was marked. In nine of them--Delaware, Virginia,\r\nTennessee, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and\r\nArkansas--the combined vote against the representative of the extreme\r\nSouthern point of view, Breckinridge, constituted a safe majority. In\r\neach of the six states which were carried by Breckinridge, there was a\r\nlarge and powerful minority. In North Carolina Breckinridge's majority\r\nover Bell and Douglas was only 849 votes. Equally astounding to those\r\nwho imagine the South united in defense of extreme views in 1860 was the\r\nvote for Bell, the Unionist candidate, who stood firmly for the\r\nConstitution and silence on slavery. In every Southern state Bell's vote\r\nwas large. In Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee it was greater\r\nthan that received by Breckinridge; in Georgia, it was 42,000 against\r\n51,000; in Louisiana, 20,000 against 22,000; in Mississippi, 25,000\r\nagainst 40,000.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Civil War upon these divisions was immediate and\r\ndecisive, save in the border states where thousands of men continued to\r\nadhere to the cause of Union. In the Confederacy itself nearly all\r\ndissent was silenced by war. Men who had been bitter opponents joined\r\nhands in defense of their homes; when the armed conflict was over they\r\nremained side by side working against \"Republican misrule and negro\r\ndomination.\" By 1890, after Northern supremacy was definitely broken,\r\nthey boasted that there were at least twelve Southern states in which no\r\nRepublican candidate for President could win a single electoral vote.\r\n\r\n=Dissent in the Solid South.=--Though every one grew accustomed to speak\r\nof the South as \"solid,\" it did not escape close observers that in a\r\nnumber of Southern states there appeared from time to time a fairly\r\nlarge body of dissenters. In 1892 the Populists made heavy inroads upon\r\nthe Democratic ranks. On other occasions, the contests between factions\r\nwithin the Democratic party over the nomination of candidates revealed\r\nsharp differences of opinion. In some places, moreover, there grew up a\r\nRepublican minority of respectable size. For example, in Georgia, Mr.\r\nTaft in 1908 polled 41,000 votes against 72,000 for Mr. Bryan; in North\r\nCarolina, 114,000 against 136,000; in Tennessee, 118,000 against\r\n135,000; in Kentucky, 235,000 against 244,000. In 1920, Senator Harding,\r\nthe Republican candidate, broke the record by carrying Tennessee as well\r\nas Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Maryland.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC ADVANCE OF THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n=The Break-up of the Great Estates.=--In the dissolution of chattel\r\nslavery it was inevitable that the great estate should give way before\r\nthe small farm. The plantation was in fact founded on slavery. It was\r\ncontinued and expanded by slavery. Before the war the prosperous\r\nplanter, either by inclination or necessity, invested his surplus in\r\nmore land to add to his original domain. As his slaves increased in\r\nnumber, he was forced to increase his acreage or sell them, and he\r\nusually preferred the former, especially in the Far South. Still another\r\nelement favored the large estate. Slave labor quickly exhausted the soil\r\nand of its own force compelled the cutting of the forests and the\r\nextension of the area under cultivation. Finally, the planter took a\r\nnatural pride in his great estate; it was a sign of his prowess and his\r\nsocial prestige.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 the foundations of the planting system were gone. It was\r\ndifficult to get efficient labor to till the vast plantations. The\r\nplanters themselves were burdened with debts and handicapped by lack of\r\ncapital. Negroes commonly preferred tilling plots of their own, rented\r\nor bought under mortgage, to the more irksome wage labor under white\r\nsupervision. The land hunger of the white farmer, once checked by the\r\nplanting system, reasserted itself. Before these forces the plantation\r\nbroke up. The small farm became the unit of cultivation in the South as\r\nin the North. Between 1870 and 1900 the number of farms doubled in every\r\nstate south of the line of the Potomac and Ohio rivers, except in\r\nArkansas and Louisiana. From year to year the process of breaking up\r\ncontinued, with all that it implied in the creation of land-owning\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\n=The Diversification of Crops.=--No less significant was the concurrent\r\ndiversification of crops. Under slavery, tobacco, rice, and sugar were\r\nstaples and \"cotton was king.\" These were standard crops. The methods of\r\ncultivation were simple and easily learned. They tested neither the\r\nskill nor the ingenuity of the slaves. As the returns were quick, they\r\ndid not call for long-time investments of capital. After slavery was\r\nabolished, they still remained the staples, but far-sighted\r\nagriculturists saw the dangers of depending upon a few crops. The mild\r\nclimate all the way around the coast from Virginia to Texas and the\r\ncharacter of the alluvial soil invited the exercise of more imagination.\r\nPeaches, oranges, peanuts, and other fruits and vegetables were found to\r\ngrow luxuriantly. Refrigeration for steamships and freight cars put the\r\nmarkets of great cities at the doors of Southern fruit and vegetable\r\ngardeners. The South, which in planting days had relied so heavily upon\r\nthe Northwest for its foodstuffs, began to battle for independence.\r\nBetween 1880 and the close of the century the value of its farm crops\r\nincreased from $660,000,000 to $1,270,000,000.\r\n\r\n=The Industrial and Commercial Revolution.=--On top of the radical\r\nchanges in agriculture came an industrial and commercial revolution. The\r\nSouth had long been rich in natural resources, but the slave system had\r\nbeen unfavorable to their development. Rivers that would have turned\r\nmillions of spindles tumbled unheeded to the seas. Coal and iron beds\r\nlay unopened. Timber was largely sacrificed in clearing lands for\r\nplanting, or fell to earth in decay. Southern enterprise was consumed in\r\nplanting. Slavery kept out the white immigrants who might have supplied\r\nthe skilled labor for industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nSTEEL MILLS--BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA]\r\n\r\nAfter 1865, achievement and fortune no longer lay on the land alone. As\r\nsoon as the paralysis of the war was over, the South caught the\r\nindustrial spirit that had conquered feudal Europe and the agricultural\r\nNorth. In the development of mineral wealth, enormous strides were\r\ntaken. Iron ore of every quality was found, the chief beds being in\r\nVirginia, West Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia,\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, and Texas. Five important coal basins were uncovered:\r\nin Virginia, North Carolina, the Appalachian chain from Maryland to\r\nNorthern Alabama, Kentucky, Arkansas, and Texas. Oil pools were found\r\nin Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas. Within two decades, 1880 to 1900, the\r\noutput of mineral wealth multiplied tenfold: from ten millions a year to\r\none hundred millions. The iron industries of West Virginia and Alabama\r\nbegan to rival those of Pennsylvania. Birmingham became the Pittsburgh\r\nand Atlanta the Chicago of the South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nA SOUTHERN COTTON MILL IN A COTTON FIELD]\r\n\r\nIn other lines of industry, lumbering and cotton manufacturing took a\r\nhigh rank. The development of Southern timber resources was in every\r\nrespect remarkable, particularly in Louisiana, Arkansas, and\r\nMississippi. At the end of the first decade of the twentieth century,\r\nprimacy in lumber had passed from the Great Lakes region to the South.\r\nIn 1913 eight Southern states produced nearly four times as much lumber\r\nas the Lake states and twice as much as the vast forests of Washington\r\nand Oregon.\r\n\r\nThe development of the cotton industry, in the meantime, was similarly\r\nastounding. In 1865 cotton spinning was a negligible matter in the\r\nSouthern states. In 1880 they had one-fourth of the mills of the\r\ncountry. At the end of the century they had one-half the mills, the two\r\nCarolinas taking the lead by consuming more than one-third of their\r\nentire cotton crop. Having both the raw materials and the power at hand,\r\nthey enjoyed many advantages over the New England rivals, and at the\r\nopening of the new century were outstripping the latter in the\r\nproportion of spindles annually put into operation. Moreover, the cotton\r\nplanters, finding a market at the neighboring mills, began to look\r\nforward to a day when they would be somewhat emancipated from absolute\r\ndependence upon the cotton exchanges of New York, New Orleans, and\r\nLiverpool.\r\n\r\nTransportation kept pace with industry. In 1860, the South had about ten\r\nthousand miles of railway. By 1880 the figure had doubled. During the\r\nnext twenty years over thirty thousand miles were added, most of the\r\nincrease being in Texas. About 1898 there opened a period of\r\nconsolidation in which scores of short lines were united, mainly under\r\nthe leadership of Northern capitalists, and new through service opened\r\nto the North and West. Thus Southern industries were given easy outlets\r\nto the markets of the nation and brought within the main currents of\r\nnational business enterprise.\r\n\r\n=The Social Effects of the Economic Changes.=--As long as the slave\r\nsystem lasted and planting was the major interest, the South was bound\r\nto be sectional in character. With slavery gone, crops diversified,\r\nnatural resources developed, and industries promoted, the social order\r\nof the ante-bellum days inevitably dissolved; the South became more and\r\nmore assimilated to the system of the North. In this process several\r\nlines of development are evident.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we see the steady rise of the small farmer. Even in\r\nthe old days there had been a large class of white yeomen who owned no\r\nslaves and tilled the soil with their own hands, but they labored under\r\nsevere handicaps. They found the fertile lands of the coast and river\r\nvalleys nearly all monopolized by planters, and they were by the force\r\nof circumstances driven into the uplands where the soil was thin and the\r\ncrops were light. Still they increased in numbers and zealously worked\r\ntheir freeholds.\r\n\r\nThe war proved to be their opportunity. With the break-up of the\r\nplantations, they managed to buy land more worthy of their plows. By\r\nintelligent labor and intensive cultivation they were able to restore\r\nmuch of the worn-out soil to its original fertility. In the meantime\r\nthey rose with their prosperity in the social and political scale. It\r\nbecame common for the sons of white farmers to enter the professions,\r\nwhile their daughters went away to college and prepared for teaching.\r\nThus a more democratic tone was given to the white society of the South.\r\nMoreover the migration to the North and West, which had formerly carried\r\nthousands of energetic sons and daughters to search for new homesteads,\r\nwas materially reduced. The energy of the agricultural population went\r\ninto rehabilitation.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the number of independent farmers was accompanied by the\r\nrise of small towns and villages which gave diversity to the life of the\r\nSouth. Before 1860 it was possible to travel through endless stretches\r\nof cotton and tobacco. The social affairs of the planter's family\r\ncentered in the homestead even if they were occasionally interrupted by\r\ntrips to distant cities or abroad. Carpentry, bricklaying, and\r\nblacksmithing were usually done by slaves skilled in simple handicrafts.\r\nSupplies were bought wholesale. In this way there was little place in\r\nplantation economy for villages and towns with their stores and\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of slavery altered this. Small farms spread out where\r\nplantations had once stood. The skilled freedmen turned to agriculture\r\nrather than to handicrafts; white men of a business or mechanical bent\r\nfound an opportunity to serve the needs of their communities. So local\r\nmerchants and mechanics became an important element in the social\r\nsystem. In the county seats, once dominated by the planters, business\r\nand professional men assumed the leadership.\r\n\r\nAnother vital outcome of this revolution was the transference of a large\r\npart of planting enterprise to business. Mr. Bruce, a Southern historian\r\nof fine scholarship, has summed up this process in a single telling\r\nparagraph: \"The higher planting class that under the old system gave so\r\nmuch distinction to rural life has, so far as it has survived at all,\r\nbeen concentrated in the cities. The families that in the time of\r\nslavery would have been found only in the country are now found, with a\r\nfew exceptions, in the towns. The transplantation has been practically\r\nuniversal. The talent, the energy, the ambition that formerly sought\r\nexpression in the management of great estates and the control of hosts\r\nof slaves, now seek a field of action in trade, in manufacturing\r\nenterprises, or in the general enterprises of development. This was for\r\nthe ruling class of the South the natural outcome of the great economic\r\nrevolution that followed the war.\"\r\n\r\nAs in all other parts of the world, the mechanical revolution was\r\nattended by the growth of a population of industrial workers dependent\r\nnot upon the soil but upon wages for their livelihood. When Jefferson\r\nDavis was inaugurated President of the Southern Confederacy, there were\r\napproximately only one hundred thousand persons employed in Southern\r\nmanufactures as against more than a million in Northern mills. Fifty\r\nyears later, Georgia and Alabama alone had more than one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand wage-earners. Necessarily this meant also a material\r\nincrease in urban population, although the wide dispersion of cotton\r\nspinning among small centers prevented the congestion that had\r\naccompanied the rise of the textile industry in New England. In 1910,\r\nNew Orleans, Atlanta, Memphis, Nashville, and Houston stood in the same\r\nrelation to the New South that Cincinnati, Chicago, Cleveland, and\r\nDetroit had stood to the New West fifty years before. The problems of\r\nlabor and capital and municipal administration, which the earlier\r\nwriters boasted would never perplex the planting South, had come in full\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE OF MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE]\r\n\r\n=The Revolution in the Status of the Slaves.=--No part of Southern\r\nsociety was so profoundly affected by the Civil War and economic\r\nreconstruction as the former slaves. On the day of emancipation, they\r\nstood free, but empty-handed, the owners of no tools or property, the\r\nmasters of no trade and wholly inexperienced in the arts of self-help\r\nthat characterized the whites in general. They had never been accustomed\r\nto looking out for themselves. The plantation bell had called them to\r\nlabor and released them. Doles of food and clothing had been regularly\r\nmade in given quantities. They did not understand wages, ownership,\r\nrenting, contracts, mortgages, leases, bills, or accounts.\r\n\r\nWhen they were emancipated, four courses were open to them. They could\r\nflee from the plantation to the nearest town or city, or to the distant\r\nNorth, to seek a livelihood. Thousands of them chose this way,\r\novercrowding cities where disease mowed them down. They could remain\r\nwhere they, were in their cabins and work for daily wages instead of\r\nfood, clothing, and shelter. This second course the major portion of\r\nthem chose; but, as few masters had cash to dispense, the new relation\r\nwas much like the old, in fact. It was still one of barter. The planter\r\noffered food, clothing, and shelter; the former slaves gave their labor\r\nin return. That was the best that many of them could do.\r\n\r\nA third course open to freedmen was that of renting from the former\r\nmaster, paying him usually with a share of the produce of the land. This\r\nway a large number of them chose. It offered them a chance to become\r\nland owners in time and it afforded an easier life, the renter being, to\r\na certain extent at least, master of his own hours of labor. The final\r\nand most difficult path was that to ownership of land. Many a master\r\nhelped his former slaves to acquire small holdings by offering easy\r\nterms. The more enterprising and the more fortunate who started life as\r\nrenters or wage-earners made their way upward to ownership in so many\r\ncases that by the end of the century, one-fourth of the colored laborers\r\non the land owned the soil they tilled.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the South, though relatively poor, made relatively\r\nlarge expenditures for the education of the colored population. By the\r\nopening of the twentieth century, facilities were provided for more than\r\none-half of the colored children of school age. While in many respects\r\nthis progress was disappointing, its significance, to be appreciated,\r\nmust be derived from a comparison with the total illiteracy which\r\nprevailed under slavery.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all that happened, however, the status of the negroes in the\r\nSouth continued to give a peculiar character to that section of the\r\ncountry. They were almost entirely excluded from the exercise of the\r\nsuffrage, especially in the Far South. Special rooms were set aside for\r\nthem at the railway stations and special cars on the railway lines. In\r\nthe field of industry calling for technical skill, it appears, from the\r\ncensus figures, that they lost ground between 1890 and 1900--a condition\r\nwhich their friends ascribed to discriminations against them in law and\r\nin labor organizations and their critics ascribed to their lack of\r\naptitude. Whatever may be the truth, the fact remained that at the\r\nopening of the twentieth century neither the hopes of the emancipators\r\nnor the fears of their opponents were realized. The marks of the\r\n\"peculiar institution\" were still largely impressed upon Southern\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThe situation, however, was by no means unchanging. On the contrary\r\nthere was a decided drift in affairs. For one thing, the proportion of\r\nnegroes in the South had slowly declined. By 1900 they were in a\r\nmajority in only two states, South Carolina and Mississippi. In\r\nArkansas, Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina the proportion of\r\nthe white population was steadily growing. The colored migration\r\nnorthward increased while the westward movement of white farmers which\r\ncharacterized pioneer days declined. At the same time a part of the\r\nforeign immigration into the United States was diverted southward. As\r\nthe years passed these tendencies gained momentum. The already huge\r\ncolored quarters in some Northern cities were widely expanded, as whole\r\ncounties in the South were stripped of their colored laborers. The race\r\nquestion, in its political and economic aspects, became less and less\r\nsectional, more and more national. The South was drawn into the main\r\nstream of national life. The separatist forces which produced the\r\ncataclysm of 1861 sank irresistibly into the background.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nH.W. Grady, _The New South_ (1890).\r\n\r\nH.A.

The chief goal of this effort was high profits for the\r\ncaptains of industry, on the one hand; and high wages for the workers,\r\non the other. Its signs, to use the language of a Republican orator in\r\n1876, were golden harvest fields, whirling spindles, turning wheels,\r\nopen furnace doors, flaming forges, and chimneys filled with eager fire.\r\nThe device blazoned on its shield and written over its factory doors was\r\n\"prosperity.\" A Republican President was its \"advance agent.\" Released\r\nfrom the hampering interference of the Southern planters and the\r\nconfusing issues of the slavery controversy, business enterprise sprang\r\nforward to the task of winning the entire country. Then it flung its\r\noutposts to the uttermost parts of the earth--Europe, Africa, and the\r\nOrient--where were to be found markets for American goods and natural\r\nresources for American capital to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILWAYS AND INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n=The Outward Signs of Enterprise.=--It is difficult to comprehend all\r\nthe multitudinous activities of American business energy or to appraise\r\nits effects upon the life and destiny of the American people; for beyond\r\nthe horizon of the twentieth century lie consequences as yet undreamed\r\nof in our poor philosophy. Statisticians attempt to record its\r\nachievements in terms of miles of railways built, factories opened, men\r\nand women employed, fortunes made, wages paid, cities founded, rivers\r\nspanned, boxes, bales, and tons produced. Historians apply standards of\r\ncomparison with the past. Against the slow and leisurely stagecoach,\r\nthey set the swift express, rushing from New York to San Francisco in\r\nless time than Washington consumed in his triumphal tour from Mt. Vernon\r\nto New York for his first inaugural. Against the lazy sailing vessel\r\ndrifting before a genial breeze, they place the turbine steamer crossing\r\nthe Atlantic in five days or the still swifter airplane, in fifteen\r\nhours. For the old workshop where a master and a dozen workmen and\r\napprentices wrought by hand, they offer the giant factory where ten\r\nthousand persons attend the whirling wheels driven by steam. They write\r\nof the \"romance of invention\" and the \"captains of industry.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nA CORNER IN THE BETHLEHEM STEEL WORKS]\r\n\r\n=The Service of the Railway.=--All this is fitting in its way. Figures\r\nand contrasts cannot, however, tell the whole story. Take, for example,\r\nthe extension of railways. It is easy to relate that there were 30,000\r\nmiles in 1860; 166,000 in 1890; and 242,000 in 1910. It is easy to show\r\nupon the map how a few straggling lines became a perfect mesh of closely\r\nknitted railways; or how, like the tentacles of a great monster, the few\r\nroads ending in the Mississippi Valley in 1860 were extended and\r\nmultiplied until they tapped every wheat field, mine, and forest beyond\r\nthe valley. All this, eloquent of enterprise as it truly is, does not\r\nreveal the significance of railways for American life. It does not\r\nindicate how railways made a continental market for American goods; nor\r\nhow they standardized the whole country, giving to cities on the\r\nadvancing frontier the leading features of cities in the old East; nor\r\nhow they carried to the pioneer the comforts of civilization; nor yet\r\nhow in the West they were the forerunners of civilization, the makers of\r\nhomesteads, the builders of states.\r\n\r\n=Government Aid for Railways.=--Still the story is not ended. The\r\nsignificant relation between railways and politics must not be\r\noverlooked. The bounty of a lavish government, for example, made\r\npossible the work of railway promoters. By the year 1872 the Federal\r\ngovernment had granted in aid of railways 155,000,000 acres of land--an\r\narea estimated as almost equal to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut,\r\nRhode Island, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The\r\nUnion Pacific Company alone secured from the federal government a free\r\nright of way through the public domain, twenty sections of land with\r\neach mile of railway, and a loan up to fifty millions of dollars secured\r\nby a second mortgage on the company's property. More than half of the\r\nnorthern tier of states lying against Canada from Lake Michigan to the\r\nPacific was granted to private companies in aid of railways and wagon\r\nroads. About half of New Mexico, Arizona, and California was also given\r\noutright to railway companies. These vast grants from the federal\r\ngovernment were supplemented by gifts from the states in land and by\r\nsubscriptions amounting to more than two hundred million dollars. The\r\nhistory of these gifts and their relation to the political leaders that\r\nengineered them would alone fill a large and interesting volume.\r\n\r\n=Railway Fortunes and Capital.=--Out of this gigantic railway promotion,\r\nthe first really immense American fortunes were made. Henry Adams, the\r\ngrandson of John Quincy Adams, related that his grandfather on his\r\nmother's side, Peter Brooks, on his death in 1849, left a fortune of two\r\nmillion dollars, \"supposed to be the largest estate in Boston,\" then one\r\nof the few centers of great riches. Compared with the opulence that\r\nsprang out of the Union Pacific, the Northern Pacific, the Southern\r\nPacific, with their subsidiary and component lines, the estate of Peter\r\nBrooks was a poor man's heritage.\r\n\r\nThe capital invested in these railways was enormous beyond the\r\nimagination of the men of the stagecoach generation. The total debt of\r\nthe United States incurred in the Revolutionary War--a debt which those\r\nof little faith thought the country could never pay--was reckoned at a\r\nfigure well under $75,000,000. When the Union Pacific Railroad was\r\ncompleted, there were outstanding against it $27,000,000 in first\r\nmortgage bonds, $27,000,000 in second mortgage bonds held by the\r\ngovernment, $10,000,000 in income bonds, $10,000,000 in land grant\r\nbonds, and, on top of that huge bonded indebtedness, $36,000,000 in\r\nstock--making $110,000,000 in all. If the amount due the United States\r\ngovernment be subtracted, still there remained, in private hands, stocks\r\nand bonds exceeding in value the whole national debt of Hamilton's\r\nday--a debt that strained all the resources of the Federal government in\r\n1790. Such was the financial significance of the railways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES IN 1918]\r\n\r\n=Growth and Extension of Industry.=--In the field of manufacturing,\r\nmining, and metal working, the results of business enterprise far\r\noutstripped, if measured in mere dollars, the results of railway\r\nconstruction. By the end of the century there were about ten billion\r\ndollars invested in factories alone and five million wage-earners\r\nemployed in them; while the total value of the output, fourteen billion\r\ndollars, was fifteen times the figure for 1860. In the Eastern states\r\nindustries multiplied. In the Northwest territory, the old home of\r\nJacksonian Democracy, they overtopped agriculture. By the end of the\r\ncentury, Ohio had almost reached and Illinois had surpassed\r\nMassachusetts in the annual value of manufacturing output.\r\n\r\nThat was not all. Untold wealth in the form of natural resources was\r\ndiscovered in the South and West. Coal deposits were found in the\r\nAppalachians stretching from Pennsylvania down to Alabama, in Michigan,\r\nin the Mississippi Valley, and in the Western mountains from North\r\nDakota to New Mexico. In nearly every coal-bearing region, iron was also\r\ndiscovered and the great fields of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota\r\nsoon rivaled those of the Appalachian area. Copper, lead, gold, and\r\nsilver in fabulous quantities were unearthed by the restless prospectors\r\nwho left no plain or mountain fastness unexplored. Petroleum, first\r\npumped from the wells of Pennsylvania in the summer of 1859, made new\r\nfortunes equaling those of trade, railways, and land speculation. It\r\nscattered its riches with an especially lavish hand through Oklahoma,\r\nTexas, and California.\r\n\r\n=The Trust--an Instrument of Industrial Progress.=--Business enterprise,\r\nunder the direction of powerful men working single-handed, or of small\r\ngroups of men pooling their capital for one or more undertakings, had\r\nnot advanced far before there appeared upon the scene still mightier\r\nleaders of even greater imagination. New constructive genius now brought\r\ntogether and combined under one management hundreds of concerns or\r\nthousands of miles of railways, revealing the magic strength of\r\ncoöperation on a national scale. Price-cutting in oil, threatening ruin\r\nto those engaged in the industry, as early as 1879, led a number of\r\ncompanies in Cleveland, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia to unite in\r\nprice-fixing. Three years later a group of oil interests formed a close\r\norganization, placing all their stocks in the hands of trustees, among\r\nwhom was John D. Rockefeller. The trustees, in turn, issued\r\ncertificates representing the share to which each participant was\r\nentitled; and took over the management of the entire business. Such was\r\nthe nature of the \"trust,\" which was to play such an unique rôle in the\r\nprogress of America.\r\n\r\nThe idea of combination was applied in time to iron and steel, copper,\r\nlead, sugar, cordage, coal, and other commodities, until in each field\r\nthere loomed a giant trust or corporation, controlling, if not most of\r\nthe output, at least enough to determine in a large measure the prices\r\ncharged to consumers. With the passing years, the railways, mills,\r\nmines, and other business concerns were transferred from individual\r\nowners to corporations. At the end of the nineteenth century, the whole\r\nface of American business was changed. Three-fourths of the output from\r\nindustries came from factories under corporate management and only\r\none-fourth from individual and partnership undertakings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER]\r\n\r\n=The Banking Corporation.=--Very closely related to the growth of\r\nbusiness enterprise on a large scale was the system of banking. In the\r\nold days before banks, a person with savings either employed them in his\r\nown undertakings, lent them to a neighbor, or hid them away where they\r\nset no industry in motion. Even in the early stages of modern business,\r\nit was common for a manufacturer to rise from small beginnings by\r\nfinancing extensions out of his own earnings and profits. This state of\r\naffairs was profoundly altered by the growth of the huge corporations\r\nrequiring millions and even billions of capital. The banks, once an\r\nadjunct to business, became the leaders in business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nWALL STREET, NEW YORK CITY]\r\n\r\nIt was the banks that undertook to sell the stocks and bonds issued by\r\nnew corporations and trusts and to supply them with credit to carry on\r\ntheir operations. Indeed, many of the great mergers or combinations in\r\nbusiness were initiated by magnates in the banking world with millions\r\nand billions under their control. Through their connections with one\r\nanother, the banks formed a perfect network of agencies gathering up the\r\npennies and dollars of the masses as well as the thousands of the rich\r\nand pouring them all into the channels of business and manufacturing.\r\nIn this growth of banking on a national scale, it was inevitable that a\r\nfew great centers, like Wall Street in New York or State Street in\r\nBoston, should rise to a position of dominance both in concentrating the\r\nsavings and profits of the nation and in financing new as well as old\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\n=The Significance of the Corporation.=--The corporation, in fact, became\r\nthe striking feature of American business life, one of the most\r\nmarvelous institutions of all time, comparable in wealth and power and\r\nthe number of its servants with kingdoms and states of old. The effect\r\nof its rise and growth cannot be summarily estimated; but some special\r\nfacts are obvious. It made possible gigantic enterprises once entirely\r\nbeyond the reach of any individual, no matter how rich. It eliminated\r\nmany of the futile and costly wastes of competition in connection with\r\nmanufacture, advertising, and selling. It studied the cheapest methods\r\nof production and shut down mills that were poorly equipped or\r\ndisadvantageously located. It established laboratories for research in\r\nindustry, chemistry, and mechanical inventions. Through the sale of\r\nstocks and bonds, it enabled tens of thousands of people to become\r\ncapitalists, if only in a small way. The corporation made it possible\r\nfor one person to own, for instance, a $50 share in a million dollar\r\nbusiness concern--a thing entirely impossible under a régime of\r\nindividual owners and partnerships.\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, another side to the picture. Many of the\r\ncorporations sought to become monopolies and to make profits, not by\r\neconomies and good management, but by extortion from purchasers.\r\nSometimes they mercilessly crushed small business men, their\r\ncompetitors, bribed members of legislatures to secure favorable laws,\r\nand contributed to the campaign funds of both leading parties. Wherever\r\na trust approached the position of a monopoly, it acquired a dominion\r\nover the labor market which enabled it to break even the strongest trade\r\nunions. In short, the power of the trust in finance, in manufacturing,\r\nin politics, and in the field of labor control can hardly be measured.\r\n\r\n=The Corporation and Labor.=--In the development of the corporation\r\nthere was to be observed a distinct severing of the old ties between\r\nmaster and workmen, which existed in the days of small industries. For\r\nthe personal bond between the owner and the employees was substituted a\r\nnew relation. \"In most parts of our country,\" as President Wilson once\r\nsaid, \"men work, not for themselves, not as partners in the old way in\r\nwhich they used to work, but generally as employees--in a higher or\r\nlower grade--of great corporations.\" The owner disappeared from the\r\nfactory and in his place came the manager, representing the usually\r\ninvisible stockholders and dependent for his success upon his ability to\r\nmake profits for the owners. Hence the term \"soulless corporation,\"\r\nwhich was to exert such a deep influence on American thinking about\r\nindustrial relations.\r\n\r\n=Cities and Immigration.=--Expressed in terms of human life, this era of\r\nunprecedented enterprise meant huge industrial cities and an immense\r\nlabor supply, derived mainly from European immigration. Here, too,\r\nfigures tell only a part of the story. In Washington's day nine-tenths\r\nof the American people were engaged in agriculture and lived in the\r\ncountry; in 1890 more than one-third of the population dwelt in towns of\r\n2500 and over; in 1920 more than half of the population lived in towns\r\nof over 2500. In forty years, between 1860 and 1900, Greater New York\r\nhad grown from 1,174,000 to 3,437,000; San Francisco from 56,000 to\r\n342,000; Chicago from 109,000 to 1,698,000. The miles of city tenements\r\nbegan to rival, in the number of their residents, the farm homesteads of\r\nthe West. The time so dreaded by Jefferson had arrived. People were\r\n\"piled upon one another in great cities\" and the republic of small\r\nfarmers had passed away.\r\n\r\nTo these industrial centers flowed annually an ever-increasing tide of\r\nimmigration, reaching the half million point in 1880; rising to\r\nthree-quarters of a million three years later; and passing the million\r\nmark in a single year at the opening of the new century. Immigration was\r\nas old as America but new elements now entered the situation. In the\r\nfirst place, there were radical changes in the nationality of the\r\nnewcomers. The migration from Northern Europe--England, Ireland,\r\nGermany, and Scandinavia--diminished; that from Italy, Russia, and\r\nAustria-Hungary increased, more than three-fourths of the entire number\r\ncoming from these three lands between the years 1900 and 1910. These\r\nlater immigrants were Italians, Poles, Magyars, Czechs, Slovaks,\r\nRussians, and Jews, who came from countries far removed from the\r\nlanguage and the traditions of England whence came the founders of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the reception accorded the newcomers differed from\r\nthat given to the immigrants in the early days. By 1890 all the free\r\nland was gone. They could not, therefore, be dispersed widely among the\r\nnative Americans to assimilate quickly and unconsciously the habits and\r\nideas of American life. On the contrary, they were diverted mainly to\r\nthe industrial centers. There they crowded--nay, overcrowded--into\r\ncolonies of their own where they preserved their languages, their\r\nnewspapers, and their old-world customs and views.\r\n\r\nSo eager were American business men to get an enormous labor supply that\r\nthey asked few questions about the effect of this \"alien invasion\" upon\r\nthe old America inherited from the fathers. They even stimulated the\r\ninvasion artificially by importing huge armies of foreigners under\r\ncontract to work in specified mines and mills. There seemed to be no\r\nlimit to the factories, forges, refineries, and railways that could be\r\nbuilt, to the multitudes that could be employed in conquering a\r\ncontinent. As for the future, that was in the hands of Providence!\r\n\r\n=Business Theories of Politics.=--As the statesmen of Hamilton's school\r\nand the planters of Calhoun's had their theories of government and\r\npolitics, so the leaders in business enterprise had theirs. It was\r\nsimple and easily stated. \"It is the duty of the government,\" they\r\nurged, \"to protect American industry against foreign competition by\r\nmeans of high tariffs on imported goods, to aid railways by generous\r\ngrants of land, to sell mineral and timber lands at low prices to\r\nenergetic men ready to develop them, and then to leave the rest to the\r\ninitiative and drive of individuals and companies.\" All government\r\ninterference with the management, prices, rates, charges, and conduct of\r\nprivate business they held to be either wholly pernicious or intolerably\r\nimpertinent. Judging from their speeches and writings, they conceived\r\nthe nation as a great collection of individuals, companies, and labor\r\nunions all struggling for profits or high wages and held together by a\r\ngovernment whose principal duty was to keep the peace among them and\r\nprotect industry against the foreign manufacturer. Such was the\r\npolitical theory of business during the generation that followed the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREMACY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY (1861-85)\r\n\r\n=Business Men and Republican Policies.=--Most of the leaders in industry\r\ngravitated to the Republican ranks. They worked in the North and the\r\nRepublican party was essentially Northern. It was moreover--at least so\r\nfar as the majority of its members were concerned--committed to\r\nprotective tariffs, a sound monetary and banking system, the promotion\r\nof railways and industry by land grants, and the development of internal\r\nimprovements. It was furthermore generous in its immigration policy. It\r\nproclaimed America to be an asylum for the oppressed of all countries\r\nand flung wide the doors for immigrants eager to fill the factories, man\r\nthe mines, and settle upon Western lands. In a word the Republicans\r\nstood for all those specific measures which favored the enlargement and\r\nprosperity of business. At the same time they resisted government\r\ninterference with private enterprise. They did not regulate railway\r\nrates, prosecute trusts for forming combinations, or prevent railway\r\ncompanies from giving lower rates to some shippers than to others. To\r\nsum it up, the political theories of the Republican party for three\r\ndecades after the Civil War were the theories of American\r\nbusiness--prosperous and profitable industries for the owners and \"the\r\nfull dinner pail\" for the workmen. Naturally a large portion of those\r\nwho flourished under its policies gave their support to it, voted for\r\nits candidates, and subscribed to its campaign funds.\r\n\r\n=Sources of Republican Strength in the North.=--The Republican party was\r\nin fact a political organization of singular power. It originated in a\r\nwave of moral enthusiasm, having attracted to itself, if not the\r\nabolitionists, certainly all those idealists, like James Russell Lowell\r\nand George William Curtis, who had opposed slavery when opposition was\r\nneither safe nor popular. To moral principles it added practical\r\nconsiderations. Business men had confidence in it. Workingmen, who\r\nlonged for the independence of the farmer, owed to its indulgent land\r\npolicy the opportunity of securing free homesteads in the West. The\r\nimmigrant, landing penniless on these shores, as a result of the same\r\nbeneficent system, often found himself in a little while with an estate\r\nas large as many a baronial domain in the Old World. Under a Republican\r\nadministration, the union had been saved. To it the veterans of the war\r\ncould turn with confidence for those rewards of service which the\r\ngovernment could bestow: pensions surpassing in liberality anything that\r\nthe world had ever seen. Under a Republican administration also the\r\ngreat debt had been created in the defense of the union, and to the\r\nRepublican party every investor in government bonds could look for the\r\nfull and honorable discharge of the interest and principal. The spoils\r\nsystem, inaugurated by Jacksonian Democracy, in turn placed all the\r\nfederal offices in Republican hands, furnishing an army of party workers\r\nto be counted on for loyal service in every campaign.\r\n\r\nOf all these things Republican leaders made full and vigorous use,\r\nsometimes ascribing to the party, in accordance with ancient political\r\nusage, merits and achievements not wholly its own. Particularly was this\r\ntrue in the case of saving the union. \"When in the economy of\r\nProvidence, this land was to be purged of human slavery ... the\r\nRepublican party came into power,\" ran a declaration in one platform.\r\n\"The Republican party suppressed a gigantic rebellion, emancipated four\r\nmillion slaves, decreed the equal citizenship of all, and established\r\nuniversal suffrage,\" ran another. As for the aid rendered by the\r\nmillions of Northern Democrats who stood by the union and the tens of\r\nthousands of them who actually fought in the union army, the Republicans\r\nin their zeal were inclined to be oblivious. They repeatedly charged the\r\nDemocratic party \"with being the same in character and spirit as when it\r\nsympathized with treason.\"\r\n\r\n=Republican Control of the South.=--To the strength enjoyed in the\r\nNorth, the Republicans for a long time added the advantages that came\r\nfrom control over the former Confederate states where the newly\r\nenfranchised negroes, under white leadership, gave a grateful support to\r\nthe party responsible for their freedom. In this branch of politics,\r\nmotives were so mixed that no historian can hope to appraise them all at\r\ntheir proper values. On the one side of the ledger must be set the\r\nvigorous efforts of the honest and sincere friends of the freedmen to\r\nwin for them complete civil and political equality, wiping out not only\r\nslavery but all its badges of misery and servitude. On the same side\r\nmust be placed the labor of those who had valiantly fought in forum and\r\nfield to save the union and who regarded continued Republican supremacy\r\nafter the war as absolutely necessary to prevent the former leaders in\r\nsecession from coming back to power. At the same time there were\r\nundoubtedly some men of the baser sort who looked on politics as a game\r\nand who made use of \"carpet-bagging\" in the South to win the spoils that\r\nmight result from it. At all events, both by laws and presidential acts,\r\nthe Republicans for many years kept a keen eye upon the maintenance of\r\ntheir dominion in the South. Their declaration that neither the law nor\r\nits administration should admit any discrimination in respect of\r\ncitizens by reason of race, color, or previous condition of servitude\r\nappealed to idealists and brought results in elections. Even South\r\nCarolina, where reposed the ashes of John C. Calhoun, went Republican in\r\n1872 by a vote of three to one!\r\n\r\nRepublican control was made easy by the force bills described in a\r\nprevious chapter--measures which vested the supervision of elections in\r\nfederal officers appointed by Republican Presidents. These drastic\r\nmeasures, departing from American tradition, the Republican authors\r\nurged, were necessary to safeguard the purity of the ballot, not merely\r\nin the South where the timid freedman might readily be frightened from\r\nusing it; but also in the North, particularly in New York City, where it\r\nwas claimed that fraud was regularly practiced by Democratic leaders.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, on their side, indignantly denied the charges, replying\r\nthat the force bills were nothing but devices created by the Republicans\r\nfor the purpose of securing their continued rule through systematic\r\ninterference with elections. Even the measures of reconstruction were\r\ndeemed by Democratic leaders as thinly veiled schemes to establish\r\nRepublican power throughout the country. \"Nor is there the slightest\r\ndoubt,\" exclaimed Samuel J. Tilden, spokesman of the Democrats in New\r\nYork and candidate for President in 1876, \"that the paramount object and\r\nmotive of the Republican party is by these means to secure itself\r\nagainst a reaction of opinion adverse to it in our great populous\r\nNorthern commonwealths.... When the Republican party resolved to\r\nestablish negro supremacy in the ten states in order to gain to itself\r\nthe representation of those states in Congress, it had to begin by\r\ngoverning the people of those states by the sword.... The next was the\r\ncreation of new electoral bodies for those ten states, in which, by\r\nexclusions, by disfranchisements and proscriptions, by control over\r\nregistration, by applying test oaths ... by intimidation and by every\r\nform of influence, three million negroes are made to predominate over\r\nfour and a half million whites.\"\r\n\r\n=The War as a Campaign Issue.=--Even the repeal of force bills could not\r\nallay the sectional feelings engendered by the war. The Republicans\r\ncould not forgive the men who had so recently been in arms against the\r\nunion and insisted on calling them \"traitors\" and \"rebels.\" The\r\nSoutherners, smarting under the reconstruction acts, could regard the\r\nRepublicans only as political oppressors. The passions of the war had\r\nbeen too strong; the distress too deep to be soon forgotten. The\r\ngeneration that went through it all remembered it all. For twenty\r\nyears, the Republicans, in their speeches and platforms, made \"a\r\nstraight appeal to the patriotism of the Northern voters.\" They\r\nmaintained that their party, which had saved the union and emancipated\r\nthe slaves, was alone worthy of protecting the union and uplifting the\r\nfreedmen.\r\n\r\nThough the Democrats, especially in the North, resented this policy and\r\ndubbed it with the expressive but inelegant phrase, \"waving the bloody\r\nshirt,\" the Republicans refused to surrender a slogan which made such a\r\nready popular appeal. As late as 1884, a leader expressed the hope that\r\nthey might \"wring one more President from the bloody shirt.\" They\r\nrefused to let the country forget that the Democratic candidate, Grover\r\nCleveland, had escaped military service by hiring a substitute; and they\r\nmade political capital out of the fact that he had \"insulted the\r\nveterans of the Grand Army of the Republic\" by going fishing on\r\nDecoration Day.\r\n\r\n=Three Republican Presidents.=--Fortified by all these elements of\r\nstrength, the Republicans held the presidency from 1869 to 1885. The\r\nthree Presidents elected in this period, Grant, Hayes, and Garfield, had\r\ncertain striking characteristics in common. They were all of origin\r\nhumble enough to please the most exacting Jacksonian Democrat. They had\r\nbeen generals in the union army. Grant, next to Lincoln, was regarded as\r\nthe savior of the Constitution. Hayes and Garfield, though lesser lights\r\nin the military firmament, had honorable records duly appreciated by\r\nveterans of the war, now thoroughly organized into the Grand Army of the\r\nRepublic. It is true that Grant was not a politician and had never voted\r\nthe Republican ticket; but this was readily overlooked. Hayes and\r\nGarfield on the other hand were loyal party men. The former had served\r\nin Congress and for three terms as governor of his state. The latter had\r\nlong been a member of the House of Representatives and was Senator-elect\r\nwhen he received the nomination for President.\r\n\r\nAll of them possessed, moreover, another important asset, which was not\r\nforgotten by the astute managers who led in selecting candidates. All\r\nof them were from Ohio--though Grant had been in Illinois when the\r\nsummons to military duties came--and Ohio was a strategic state. It lay\r\nbetween the manufacturing East and the agrarian country to the West.\r\nHaving growing industries and wool to sell it benefited from the\r\nprotective tariff. Yet being mainly agricultural still, it was not\r\nwithout sympathy for the farmers who showed low tariff or free trade\r\ntendencies. Whatever share the East had in shaping laws and framing\r\npolicies, it was clear that the West was to have the candidates. This\r\ndivision in privileges--not uncommon in political management--was always\r\naccompanied by a judicious selection of the candidate for Vice\r\nPresident. With Garfield, for example, was associated a prominent New\r\nYork politician, Chester A. Arthur, who, as fate decreed, was destined\r\nto more than three years' service as chief magistrate, on the\r\nassassination of his superior in office.\r\n\r\n=The Disputed Election of 1876.=--While taking note of the long years of\r\nRepublican supremacy, it must be recorded that grave doubts exist in the\r\nminds of many historians as to whether one of the three Presidents,\r\nHayes, was actually the victor in 1876 or not. His Democratic opponent,\r\nSamuel J. Tilden, received a popular plurality of a quarter of a million\r\nand had a plausible claim to a majority of the electoral vote. At all\r\nevents, four states sent in double returns, one set for Tilden and\r\nanother for Hayes; and a deadlock ensued. Both parties vehemently\r\nclaimed the election and the passions ran so high that sober men did not\r\nshrink from speaking of civil war again. Fortunately, in the end, the\r\ncounsels of peace prevailed. Congress provided for an electoral\r\ncommission of fifteen men to review the contested returns. The\r\nDemocrats, inspired by Tilden's moderation, accepted the judgment in\r\nfavor of Hayes even though they were not convinced that he was really\r\nentitled to the office.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF OPPOSITION TO REPUBLICAN RULE\r\n\r\n=Abuses in American Political Life.=--During their long tenure of\r\noffice, the Republicans could not escape the inevitable consequences of\r\npower; that is, evil practices and corrupt conduct on the part of some\r\nwho found shelter within the party. For that matter neither did the\r\nDemocrats manage to avoid such difficulties in those states and cities\r\nwhere they had the majority. In New York City, for instance, the local\r\nDemocratic organization, known as Tammany Hall, passed under the sway of\r\na group of politicians headed by \"Boss\" Tweed. He plundered the city\r\ntreasury until public-spirited citizens, supported by Samuel J. Tilden,\r\nthe Democratic leader of the state, rose in revolt, drove the ringleader\r\nfrom power, and sent him to jail. In Philadelphia, the local Republican\r\nbosses were guilty of offenses as odious as those committed by New York\r\npoliticians. Indeed, the decade that followed the Civil War was marred\r\nby so many scandals in public life that one acute editor was moved to\r\ninquire: \"Are not all the great communities of the Western World growing\r\nmore corrupt as they grow in wealth?\"\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of national politics, where the opportunities were\r\ngreater, betrayals of public trust were even more flagrant. One\r\nrevelation after another showed officers, high and low, possessed with\r\nthe spirit of peculation. Members of Congress, it was found, accepted\r\nrailway stock in exchange for votes in favor of land grants and other\r\nconcessions to the companies. In the administration as well as the\r\nlegislature the disease was rife. Revenue officers permitted whisky\r\ndistillers to evade their taxes and received heavy bribes in return. A\r\nprobe into the post-office department revealed the malodorous \"star\r\nroute frauds\"--the deliberate overpayment of certain mail carriers whose\r\nlines were indicated in the official record by asterisks or stars. Even\r\ncabinet officers did not escape suspicion, for the trail of the serpent\r\nled straight to the door of one of them.\r\n\r\nIn the lower ranges of official life, the spoils system became more\r\nvirulent as the number of federal employees increased. The holders of\r\noffices and the seekers after them constituted a veritable political\r\narmy. They crowded into Republican councils, for the Republicans, being\r\nin power, could alone dispense federal favors. They filled positions in\r\nthe party ranging from the lowest township committee to the national\r\nconvention. They helped to nominate candidates and draft platforms and\r\nelbowed to one side the busy citizen, not conversant with party\r\nintrigues, who could only give an occasional day to political matters.\r\nEven the Civil Service Act of 1883, wrung from a reluctant Congress two\r\nyears after the assassination of Garfield, made little change for a long\r\ntime. It took away from the spoilsmen a few thousand government\r\npositions, but it formed no check on the practice of rewarding party\r\nworkers from the public treasury.\r\n\r\nOn viewing this state of affairs, many a distinguished citizen became\r\nprofoundly discouraged. James Russell Lowell, for example, thought he\r\nsaw a steady decline in public morals. In 1865, hearing of Lee's\r\nsurrender, he had exclaimed: \"There is something magnificent in having a\r\ncountry to love!\" Ten years later, when asked to write an ode for the\r\ncentennial at Philadelphia in 1876, he could think only of a biting\r\nsatire on the nation:\r\n\r\n    \"Show your state legislatures; show your Rings;\r\n     And challenge Europe to produce such things\r\n     As high officials sitting half in sight\r\n     To share the plunder and fix things right.\r\n     If that don't fetch her, why, you need only\r\n     To show your latest style in martyrs,--Tweed:\r\n     She'll find it hard to hide her spiteful tears\r\n     At such advance in one poor hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nWhen his critics condemned him for this \"attack upon his native land,\"\r\nLowell replied in sadness: \"These fellows have no notion of what love of\r\ncountry means. It was in my very blood and bones. If I am not an\r\nAmerican who ever was?... What fills me with doubt and dismay is the\r\ndegradation of the moral tone. Is it or is it not a result of democracy?\r\nIs ours a 'government of the people, by the people, for the people,' or\r\na Kakistocracy [a government of the worst], rather for the benefit of\r\nknaves at the cost of fools?\"\r\n\r\n=The Reform Movement in Republican Ranks.=--The sentiments expressed by\r\nLowell, himself a Republican and for a time American ambassador to\r\nEngland, were shared by many men in his party. Very soon after the close\r\nof the Civil War some of them began to protest vigorously against the\r\npolicies and conduct of their leaders. In 1872, the dissenters, calling\r\nthemselves Liberal Republicans, broke away altogether, nominated a\r\ncandidate of their own, Horace Greeley, and put forward a platform\r\nindicting the Republican President fiercely enough to please the most\r\nuncompromising Democrat. They accused Grant of using \"the powers and\r\nopportunities of his high office for the promotion of personal ends.\"\r\nThey charged him with retaining \"notoriously corrupt and unworthy men in\r\nplaces of power and responsibility.\" They alleged that the Republican\r\nparty kept \"alive the passions and resentments of the late civil war to\r\nuse them for their own advantages,\" and employed the \"public service of\r\nthe government as a machinery of corruption and personal influence.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not apparent, however, from the ensuing election that any\r\nconsiderable number of Republicans accepted the views of the Liberals.\r\nGreeley, though indorsed by the Democrats, was utterly routed and died\r\nof a broken heart. The lesson of his discomfiture seemed to be that\r\nindependent action was futile. So, at least, it was regarded by most men\r\nof the rising generation like Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, and\r\nTheodore Roosevelt, of New York. Profiting by the experience of Greeley\r\nthey insisted in season and out that reformers who desired to rid the\r\nparty of abuses should remain loyal to it and do their work \"on the\r\ninside.\"\r\n\r\n=The Mugwumps and Cleveland Democracy in 1884.=--Though aided by\r\nRepublican dissensions, the Democrats were slow in making headway\r\nagainst the political current. They were deprived of the energetic and\r\ncapable leadership once afforded by the planters, like Calhoun, Davis,\r\nand Toombs; they were saddled by their opponents with responsibility for\r\nsecession; and they were stripped of the support of the prostrate\r\nSouth. Not until the last Southern state was restored to the union, not\r\nuntil a general amnesty was wrung from Congress, not until white\r\nsupremacy was established at the polls, and the last federal soldier\r\nwithdrawn from Southern capitals did they succeed in capturing the\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nThe opportune moment for them came in 1884 when a number of\r\ncircumstances favored their aspirations. The Republicans, leaving the\r\nOhio Valley in their search for a candidate, nominated James G. Blaine\r\nof Maine, a vigorous and popular leader but a man under fire from the\r\nreformers in his own party. The Democrats on their side were able to\r\nfind at this juncture an able candidate who had no political enemies in\r\nthe sphere of national politics, Grover Cleveland, then governor of New\r\nYork and widely celebrated as a man of \"sterling honesty.\" At the same\r\ntime a number of dissatisfied Republicans openly espoused the Democratic\r\ncause,--among them Carl Schurz, George William Curtis, Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, and William Everett, men of fine ideals and undoubted\r\nintegrity. Though the \"regular\" Republicans called them \"Mugwumps\" and\r\nlaughed at them as the \"men milliners, the dilettanti, and carpet\r\nknights of politics,\" they had a following that was not to be despised.\r\n\r\nThe campaign which took place that year was one of the most savage in\r\nAmerican history. Issues were thrust into the background. The tariff,\r\nthough mentioned, was not taken seriously. Abuse of the opposition was\r\nthe favorite resource of party orators. The Democrats insisted that \"the\r\nRepublican party so far as principle is concerned is a reminiscence. In\r\npractice it is an organization for enriching those who control its\r\nmachinery.\" For the Republican candidate, Blaine, they could hardly find\r\nwords to express their contempt. The Republicans retaliated in kind.\r\nThey praised their own good works, as of old, in saving the union, and\r\ndenounced the \"fraud and violence practiced by the Democracy in the\r\nSouthern states.\" Seeing little objectionable in the public record of\r\nCleveland as mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York, they attacked\r\nhis personal character. Perhaps never in the history of political\r\ncampaigns did the discussions on the platform and in the press sink to\r\nso low a level. Decent people were sickened. Even hot partisans shrank\r\nfrom their own words when, after the election, they had time to reflect\r\non their heedless passions. Moreover, nothing was decided by the\r\nballoting. Cleveland was elected, but his victory was a narrow one. A\r\nchange of a few hundred votes in New York would have sent his opponent\r\nto the White House instead.\r\n\r\n=Changing Political Fortunes (1888-96).=--After the Democrats had\r\nsettled down to the enjoyment of their hard-earned victory, President\r\nCleveland in his message of 1887 attacked the tariff as \"vicious,\r\ninequitable, and illogical\"; as a system of taxation that laid a burden\r\nupon \"every consumer in the land for the benefit of our manufacturers.\"\r\nBusiness enterprise was thoroughly alarmed. The Republicans\r\ncharacterized the tariff message as a free-trade assault upon the\r\nindustries of the country. Mainly on that issue they elected in 1888\r\nBenjamin Harrison of Indiana, a shrewd lawyer, a reticent politician, a\r\ndescendant of the hero of Tippecanoe, and a son of the old Northwest.\r\nAccepting the outcome of the election as a vindication of their\r\nprinciples, the Republicans, under the leadership of William McKinley in\r\nthe House of Representatives, enacted in 1890 a tariff law imposing the\r\nhighest duties yet laid in our history. To their utter surprise,\r\nhowever, they were instantly informed by the country that their program\r\nwas not approved. That very autumn they lost in the congressional\r\nelections, and two years later they were decisively beaten in the\r\npresidential campaign, Cleveland once more leading his party to victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nL.H.

Beyond the Rockies, California, Oregon, and Nevada\r\nstood guard, the last of them having been just admitted to furnish\r\nanother vote for the fifteenth amendment abolishing slavery. Between the\r\nnear and far frontiers lay a vast reach of plain, desert, plateau, and\r\nmountain, almost wholly undeveloped. A broad domain, extending from\r\nCanada to Mexico, and embracing the regions now included in Washington,\r\nIdaho, Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, the Dakotas, and\r\nOklahoma, had fewer than half a million inhabitants. It was laid out\r\ninto territories, each administered under a governor appointed by the\r\nPresident and Senate and, as soon as there was the requisite number of\r\ninhabitants, a legislature elected by the voters. No railway line\r\nstretched across the desert. St. Joseph on the Missouri was the terminus\r\nof the Eastern lines. It required twenty-five days for a passenger to\r\nmake the overland journey to California by the stagecoach system,\r\nestablished in 1858, and more than ten days for the swift pony express,\r\norganized in 1860, to carry a letter to San Francisco. Indians still\r\nroamed the plain and desert and more than one powerful tribe disputed\r\nthe white man's title to the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAYS AS TRAIL BLAZERS\r\n\r\n=Opening Railways to the Pacific.=--A decade before the Civil War the\r\nimportance of rail connection between the East and the Pacific Coast had\r\nbeen recognized. Pressure had already been brought to bear on Congress\r\nto authorize the construction of a line and to grant land and money in\r\nits aid. Both the Democrats and Republicans approved the idea, but it\r\nwas involved in the slavery controversy. Indeed it was submerged in it.\r\nSouthern statesmen wanted connections between the Gulf and the Pacific\r\nthrough Texas, while Northerners stood out for a central route.\r\n\r\nThe North had its way during the war. Congress, by legislation initiated\r\nin 1862, provided for the immediate organization of companies to build a\r\nline from the Missouri River to California and made grants of land and\r\nloans of money to aid in the enterprise. The Western end, the Central\r\nPacific, was laid out under the supervision of Leland Stanford. It was\r\nheavily financed by the Mormons of Utah and also by the state\r\ngovernment, the ranchmen, miners, and business men of California; and it\r\nwas built principally by Chinese labor. The Eastern end, the Union\r\nPacific, starting at Omaha, was constructed mainly by veterans of the\r\nCivil War and immigrants from Ireland and Germany. In 1869 the two\r\ncompanies met near Ogden in Utah and the driving of the last spike,\r\nuniting the Atlantic and the Pacific, was the occasion of a great\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nOther lines to the Pacific were projected at the same time; but the\r\npanic of 1873 checked railway enterprise for a while. With the revival\r\nof prosperity at the end of that decade, construction was renewed with\r\nvigor and the year 1883 marked a series of railway triumphs. In February\r\ntrains were running from New Orleans through Houston, San Antonio, and\r\nYuma to San Francisco, as a result of a union of the Texas Pacific with\r\nthe Southern Pacific and its subsidiary corporations. In September the\r\nlast spike was driven in the Northern Pacific at Helena, Montana. Lake\r\nSuperior was connected with Puget Sound. The waters explored by Joliet\r\nand Marquette were joined to the waters plowed by Sir Francis Drake\r\nwhile he was searching for a route around the world. That same year also\r\na third line was opened to the Pacific by way of the Atchison, Topeka\r\nand Santa Fé, making connections through Albuquerque and Needles with\r\nSan Francisco. The fondest hopes of railway promoters seemed to be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNITED STATES IN 1870]\r\n\r\n=Western Railways Precede Settlement.=--In the Old World and on our\r\nAtlantic seaboard, railways followed population and markets. In the Far\r\nWest, railways usually preceded the people. Railway builders planned\r\ncities on paper before they laid tracks connecting them. They sent\r\nmissionaries to spread the gospel of \"Western opportunity\" to people in\r\nthe Middle West, in the Eastern cities, and in Southern states. Then\r\nthey carried their enthusiastic converts bag and baggage in long trains\r\nto the distant Dakotas and still farther afield. So the development of\r\nthe Far West was not left to the tedious processes of time. It was\r\npushed by men of imagination--adventurers who made a romance of\r\nmoney-making and who had dreams of empire unequaled by many kings of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nThese empire builders bought railway lands in huge tracts; they got more\r\nfrom the government; they overcame every obstacle of cañon, mountain,\r\nand stream with the aid of science; they built cities according to the\r\nplans made by the engineers. Having the towns ready and railway and\r\nsteamboat connections formed with the rest of the world, they carried\r\nout the people to use the railways, the steamships, the houses, and the\r\nland. It was in this way that \"the frontier speculator paved the way for\r\nthe frontier agriculturalist who had to be near a market before he could\r\nfarm.\" The spirit of this imaginative enterprise, which laid out\r\nrailways and towns in advance of the people, is seen in an advertisement\r\nof that day: \"This extension will run 42 miles from York, northeast\r\nthrough the Island Lake country, and will have five good North Dakota\r\ntowns. The stations on the line will be well equipped with elevators and\r\nwill be constructed and ready for operation at the commencement of the\r\ngrain season. Prospective merchants have been active in securing\r\ndesirable locations at the different towns on the line. There are still\r\nopportunities for hotels, general merchandise, hardware, furniture, and\r\ndrug stores, etc.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nA TOWN ON THE PRAIRIE]\r\n\r\nAmong the railway promoters and builders in the West, James J. Hill,\r\nof the Great Northern and allied lines, was one of the most forceful\r\nfigures. He knew that tracks and trains were useless without passengers\r\nand freight; without a population of farmers and town dwellers. He\r\ntherefore organized publicity in the Virginias, Iowa, Ohio, Indiana,\r\nIllinois, Wisconsin, and Nebraska especially. He sent out agents to tell\r\nthe story of Western opportunity in this vein: \"You see your children\r\ncome out of school with no chance to get farms of their own because the\r\ncost of land in your older part of the country is so high that you can't\r\nafford to buy land to start your sons out in life around you. They have\r\nto go to the cities to make a living or become laborers in the mills or\r\nhire out as farm hands. There is no future for them there. If you are\r\ndoing well where you are and can safeguard the future of your children\r\nand see them prosper around you, don't leave here. But if you want\r\nindependence, if you are renting your land, if the money-lender is\r\ncarrying you along and you are running behind year after year, you can\r\ndo no worse by moving.... You farmers talk of free trade and protection\r\nand what this or that political party will do for you. Why don't you\r\nvote a homestead for yourself? That is the only thing Uncle Sam will\r\never give you. Jim Hill hasn't an acre of land to sell you. We are not\r\nin the real estate business. We don't want you to go out West and make a\r\nfailure of it because the rates at which we haul you and your goods make\r\nthe first transaction a loss.... We must have landless men for a manless\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\nUnlike steamship companies stimulating immigration to get the fares,\r\nHill was seeking permanent settlers who would produce, manufacture, and\r\nuse the railways as the means of exchange. Consequently he fixed low\r\nrates and let his passengers take a good deal of live stock and\r\nhousehold furniture free. By doing this he made an appeal that was\r\nanswered by eager families. In 1894 the vanguard of home seekers left\r\nIndiana in fourteen passenger coaches, filled with men, women, and\r\nchildren, and forty-eight freight cars carrying their household goods\r\nand live stock. In the ten years that followed, 100,000 people from the\r\nMiddle West and the South, responding to his call, went to the Western\r\ncountry where they brought eight million acres of prairie land under\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nWhen Hill got his people on the land, he took an interest in everything\r\nthat increased the productivity of their labor. Was the output of food\r\nfor his freight cars limited by bad drainage on the farms? Hill then\r\ninterested himself in practical ways of ditching and tiling. Were\r\nfarmers hampered in hauling their goods to his trains by bad roads? In\r\nthat case, he urged upon the states the improvement of highways. Did the\r\ntraffic slacken because the food shipped was not of the best quality?\r\nThen live stock must be improved and scientific farming promoted. Did\r\nthe farmers need credit? Banks must be established close at hand to\r\nadvance it. In all conferences on scientific farm management,\r\nconservation of natural resources, banking and credit in relation to\r\nagriculture and industry, Hill was an active participant. His was the\r\nlong vision, seeing in conservation and permanent improvements the\r\nfoundation of prosperity for the railways and the people.\r\n\r\nIndeed, he neglected no opportunity to increase the traffic on the\r\nlines. He wanted no empty cars running in either direction and no wheat\r\nstored in warehouses for the lack of markets. So he looked to the Orient\r\nas well as to Europe as an outlet for the surplus of the farms. He sent\r\nagents to China and Japan to discover what American goods and produce\r\nthose countries would consume and what manufactures they had to offer to\r\nAmericans in exchange. To open the Pacific trade he bought two ocean\r\nmonsters, the _Minnesota_ and the _Dakota_, thus preparing for\r\nemergencies West as well as East. When some Japanese came to the United\r\nStates on their way to Europe to buy steel rails, Hill showed them how\r\neasy it was for them to make their purchase in this country and ship by\r\nway of American railways and American vessels. So the railway builder\r\nand promoter, who helped to break the virgin soil of the prairies, lived\r\nthrough the pioneer epoch and into the age of great finance. Before he\r\ndied he saw the wheat fields of North Dakota linked with the spinning\r\njennies of Manchester and the docks of Yokohama.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF GRAZING AND AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n=The Removal of the Indians.=--Unlike the frontier of New England in\r\ncolonial days or that of Kentucky later, the advancing lines of home\r\nbuilders in the Far West had little difficulty with warlike natives.\r\nIndian attacks were made on the railway construction gangs; General\r\nCuster had his fatal battle with the Sioux in 1876 and there were minor\r\nbrushes; but they were all of relatively slight consequence. The former\r\npractice of treating with the Indians as independent nations was\r\nabandoned in 1871 and most of them were concentrated in reservations\r\nwhere they were mainly supported by the government. The supervision of\r\ntheir affairs was vested in a board of commissioners created in 1869 and\r\ninstructed to treat them as wards of the nation--a trust which\r\nunfortunately was often betrayed. A further step in Indian policy was\r\ntaken in 1887 when provision was made for issuing lands to individual\r\nIndians, thus permitting them to become citizens and settle down among\r\ntheir white neighbors as farmers or cattle raisers. The disappearance of\r\nthe buffalo, the main food supply of the wild Indians, had made them\r\nmore tractable and more willing to surrender the freedom of the hunter\r\nfor the routine of the reservation, ranch, or wheat field.\r\n\r\n=The Cowboy and Cattle Ranger.=--Between the frontier of farms and the\r\nmountains were plains and semi-arid regions in vast reaches suitable for\r\ngrazing. As soon as the railways were open into the Missouri Valley,\r\naffording an outlet for stock, there sprang up to the westward cattle\r\nand sheep raising on an immense scale. The far-famed American cowboy was\r\nthe hero in this scene. Great herds of cattle were bred in Texas; with\r\nthe advancing spring and summer seasons, they were driven northward\r\nacross the plains and over the buffalo trails. In a single year, 1884,\r\nit is estimated that nearly one million head of cattle were moved out of\r\nTexas to the North by four thousand cowboys, supplied with 30,000\r\nhorses and ponies.\r\n\r\nDuring the two decades from 1870 to 1890 both the cattle men and the\r\nsheep raisers had an almost free run of the plains, using public lands\r\nwithout paying for the privilege and waging war on one another over the\r\npossession of ranges. At length, however, both had to go, as the\r\nhomesteaders and land companies came and fenced in the plain and desert\r\nwith endless lines of barbed wire. Already in 1893 a writer familiar\r\nwith the frontier lamented the passing of the picturesque days: \"The\r\nunique position of the cowboys among the Americans is jeopardized in a\r\nthousand ways. Towns are growing up on their pasture lands; irrigation\r\nschemes of a dozen sorts threaten to turn bunch-grass scenery into\r\nfarm-land views; farmers are pre-empting valleys and the sides of\r\nwaterways; and the day is not far distant when stock-raising must be\r\ndone mainly in small herds, with winter corrals, and then the cowboy's\r\ndays will end. Even now his condition disappoints those who knew him\r\nonly half a dozen years ago. His breed seems to have deteriorated and\r\nhis ranks are filling with men who work for wages rather than for the\r\nlove of the free life and bold companionship that once tempted men into\r\nthat calling. Splendid Cheyenne saddles are less and less numerous in\r\nthe outfits; the distinctive hat that made its way up from Mexico may or\r\nmay not be worn; all the civil authorities in nearly all towns in the\r\ngrazing country forbid the wearing of side arms; nobody shoots up these\r\ntowns any more. The fact is the old simon-pure cowboy days are gone\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\n=Settlement under the Homestead Act of 1862.=--Two factors gave a\r\nspecial stimulus to the rapid settlement of Western lands which swept\r\naway the Indians and the cattle rangers. The first was the policy of the\r\nrailway companies in selling large blocks of land received from the\r\ngovernment at low prices to induce immigration. The second was the\r\noperation of the Homestead law passed in 1862. This measure practically\r\nclosed the long controversy over the disposition of the public domain\r\nthat was suitable for agriculture. It provided for granting, without any\r\ncost save a small registration fee, public lands in lots of 160 acres\r\neach to citizens and aliens who declared their intention of becoming\r\ncitizens. The one important condition attached was that the settler\r\nshould occupy the farm for five years before his title was finally\r\nconfirmed. Even this stipulation was waived in the case of the Civil War\r\nveterans who were allowed to count their term of military service as a\r\npart of the five years' occupancy required. As the soldiers of the\r\nRevolutionary and Mexican wars had advanced in great numbers to the\r\nfrontier in earlier days, so now veterans led in the settlement of the\r\nmiddle border. Along with them went thousands of German, Irish, and\r\nScandinavian immigrants, fresh from the Old World. Between 1867 and\r\n1874, 27,000,000 acres were staked out in quarter-section farms. In\r\ntwenty years (1860-80), the population of Nebraska leaped from 28,000 to\r\nalmost half a million; Kansas from 100,000 to a million; Iowa from\r\n600,000 to 1,600,000; and the Dakotas from 5000 to 140,000.\r\n\r\n=The Diversity of Western Agriculture.=--In soil, produce, and\r\nmanagement, Western agriculture presented many contrasts to that of the\r\nEast and South. In the region of arable and watered lands the typical\r\nAmerican unit--the small farm tilled by the owner--appeared as usual;\r\nbut by the side of it many a huge domain owned by foreign or Eastern\r\ncompanies and tilled by hired labor. Sometimes the great estate took the\r\nshape of the \"bonanza farm\" devoted mainly to wheat and corn and\r\ncultivated on a large scale by machinery. Again it assumed the form of\r\nthe cattle ranch embracing tens of thousands of acres. Again it was a\r\nvast holding of diversified interest, such as the Santa Anita ranch near\r\nLos Angeles, a domain of 60,000 acres \"cultivated in a glorious sweep of\r\nvineyards and orange and olive orchards, rich sheep and cattle pastures\r\nand horse ranches, their life and customs handed down from the Spanish\r\nowners of the various ranches which were swept into one estate.\"\r\n\r\n=Irrigation.=--In one respect agriculture in the Far West was unique. In\r\na large area spreading through eight states, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming,\r\nUtah, Colorado, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and parts of adjoining\r\nstates, the rainfall was so slight that the ordinary crops to which the\r\nAmerican farmer was accustomed could not be grown at all. The Mormons\r\nwere the first Anglo-Saxons to encounter aridity, and they were baffled\r\nat first; but they studied it and mastered it by magnificent irrigation\r\nsystems. As other settlers poured into the West the problem of the\r\ndesert was attacked with a will, some of them replying to the\r\ncommiseration of Eastern farmers by saying that it was easier to scoop\r\nout an irrigation ditch than to cut forests and wrestle with stumps and\r\nstones. Private companies bought immense areas at low prices, built\r\nirrigation works, and disposed of their lands in small plots. Some\r\nranchers with an instinct for water, like that of the miner for metal,\r\nsank wells into the dry sand and were rewarded with gushers that \"soused\r\nthe thirsty desert and turned its good-for-nothing sand into\r\ngood-for-anything loam.\" The federal government came to the aid of the\r\narid regions in 1894 by granting lands to the states to be used for\r\nirrigation purposes. In this work Wyoming took the lead with a law which\r\ninduced capitalists to invest in irrigation and at the same time\r\nprovided for the sale of the redeemed lands to actual settlers. Finally\r\nin 1902 the federal government by its liberal Reclamation Act added its\r\nstrength to that of individuals, companies, and states in conquering\r\n\"arid America.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nowhere,\" writes Powell, a historian of the West, in his picturesque\r\n_End of the Trail_, \"has the white man fought a more courageous fight or\r\nwon a more brilliant victory than in Arizona. His weapons have been the\r\ntransit and the level, the drill and the dredge, the pick and the spade;\r\nand the enemy which he has conquered has been the most stubborn of all\r\nfoes--the hostile forces of Nature.... The story of how the white man\r\nwithin the space of less than thirty years penetrated, explored, and\r\nmapped this almost unknown region; of how he carried law, order, and\r\njustice into a section which had never had so much as a speaking\r\nacquaintance with any one of the three before; of how, realizing the\r\nnecessity for means of communication, he built highways of steel across\r\nthis territory from east to west and from north to south; of how,\r\nundismayed by the savageness of the countenance which the desert turned\r\nupon him, he laughed and rolled up his sleeves, and spat upon his hands,\r\nand slashed the face of the desert with canals and irrigating ditches,\r\nand filled those ditches with water brought from deep in the earth or\r\nhigh in the mountains; and of how, in the conquered and submissive soil,\r\nhe replaced the aloe with alfalfa, the mesquite with maize, the cactus\r\nwith cotton, forms one of the most inspiring chapters in our history. It\r\nis one of the epics of civilization, this reclamation of the Southwest,\r\nand its heroes, thank God, are Americans.\r\n\r\n\"Other desert regions have been redeemed by irrigation--Egypt, for\r\nexample, and Mesopotamia and parts of the Sudan--but the people of all\r\nthose regions lay stretched out in the shade of a convenient palm,\r\nmetaphorically speaking, and waited for some one with more energy than\r\nthemselves to come along and do the work. But the Arizonians, mindful of\r\nthe fact that God, the government, and Carnegie help those who help\r\nthemselves, spent their days wielding the pick and shovel, and their\r\nevenings in writing letters to Washington with toil-hardened hands.\r\nAfter a time the government was prodded into action and the great dams\r\nat Laguna and Roosevelt are the result. Then the people, organizing\r\nthemselves into coöperative leagues and water-users' associations, took\r\nup the work of reclamation where the government left off; it is to these\r\nenergetic, persevering men who have drilled wells, plowed fields, and\r\ndug ditches through the length and breadth of that great region which\r\nstretches from Yuma to Tucson, that the metamorphosis of Arizona is\r\ndue.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of irrigation wherever introduced was amazing. Stretches of\r\nsand and sagebrush gave way to fertile fields bearing crops of wheat,\r\ncorn, fruits, vegetables, and grass. Huge ranches grazed by browsing\r\nsheep were broken up into small plots. The cowboy and ranchman vanished.\r\nIn their place rose the prosperous community--a community unlike the\r\ntownship of Iowa or the industrial center of the East. Its intensive\r\ntillage left little room for hired labor. Its small holdings drew\r\nfamilies together in village life rather than dispersing them on the\r\nlonely plain. Often the development of water power in connection with\r\nirrigation afforded electricity for labor-saving devices and lifted many\r\na burden that in other days fell heavily upon the shoulders of the\r\nfarmer and his family.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINING AND MANUFACTURING IN THE WEST\r\n\r\n=Mineral Resources.=--In another important particular the Far West\r\ndiffered from the Mississippi Valley states. That was in the\r\npredominance of mining over agriculture throughout a vast section.\r\nIndeed it was the minerals rather than the land that attracted the\r\npioneers who first opened the country. The discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia in 1848 was the signal for the great rush of prospectors,\r\nminers, and promoters who explored the valleys, climbed the hills,\r\nwashed the sands, and dug up the soil in their feverish search for gold,\r\nsilver, copper, coal, and other minerals. In Nevada and Montana the\r\ndevelopment of mineral resources went on all during the Civil War. Alder\r\nGulch became Virginia City in 1863; Last Chance Gulch was named Helena\r\nin 1864; and Confederate Gulch was christened Diamond City in 1865. At\r\nButte the miners began operations in 1864 and within five years had\r\nwashed out eight million dollars' worth of gold. Under the gold they\r\nfound silver; under silver they found copper.\r\n\r\nEven at the end of the nineteenth century, after agriculture was well\r\nadvanced and stock and sheep raising introduced on a large scale,\r\nminerals continued to be the chief source of wealth in a number of\r\nstates. This was revealed by the figures for 1910. The gold, silver,\r\niron, and copper of Colorado were worth more than the wheat, corn, and\r\noats combined; the copper of Montana sold for more than all the cereals\r\nand four times the price of the wheat. The interest of Nevada was also\r\nmainly mining, the receipts from the mineral output being $43,000,000 or\r\nmore than one-half the national debt of Hamilton's day. The yield of the\r\nmines of Utah was worth four or five times the wheat crop; the coal of\r\nWyoming brought twice as much as the great wool clip; the minerals of\r\nArizona were totaled at $43,000,000 as against a wool clip reckoned at\r\n$1,200,000; while in Idaho alone of this group of states did the wheat\r\ncrop exceed in value the output of the mines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nLOGGING]\r\n\r\n=Timber Resources.=--The forests of the great West, unlike those of the\r\nOhio Valley, proved a boon to the pioneers rather than a foe to be\r\nattacked. In Ohio and Indiana, for example, the frontier line of\r\nhomemakers had to cut, roll, and burn thousands of trees before they\r\ncould put out a crop of any size. Beyond the Mississippi, however,\r\nthere were all ready for the breaking plow great reaches of almost\r\ntreeless prairie, where every stick of timber was precious. In the other\r\nparts, often rough and mountainous, where stood primeval forests of the\r\nfinest woods, the railroads made good use of the timber. They consumed\r\nacres of forests themselves in making ties, bridge timbers, and\r\ntelegraph poles, and they laid a heavy tribute upon the forests for\r\ntheir annual upkeep. The surplus trees, such as had burdened the\r\npioneers of the Northwest Territory a hundred years before, they carried\r\noff to markets on the east and west coasts.\r\n\r\n=Western Industries.=--The peculiar conditions of the Far West\r\nstimulated a rise of industries more rapid than is usual in new country.\r\nThe mining activities which in many sections preceded agriculture called\r\nfor sawmills to furnish timber for the mines and smelters to reduce and\r\nrefine ores. The ranches supplied sheep and cattle for the packing\r\nhouses of Kansas City as well as Chicago. The waters of the Northwest\r\nafforded salmon for 4000 cases in 1866 and for 1,400,000 cases in 1916.\r\nThe fruits and vegetables of California brought into existence\r\ninnumerable canneries. The lumber industry, starting with crude sawmills\r\nto furnish rough timbers for railways and mines, ended in specialized\r\nfactories for paper, boxes, and furniture. As the railways preceded\r\nsettlement and furnished a ready outlet for local manufactures, so they\r\nencouraged the early establishment of varied industries, thus creating a\r\nstate of affairs quite unlike that which obtained in the Ohio Valley in\r\nthe early days before the opening of the Erie Canal.\r\n\r\n=Social Effects of Economic Activities.=--In many respects the social\r\nlife of the Far West also differed from that of the Ohio Valley. The\r\ntreeless prairies, though open to homesteads, favored the great estate\r\ntilled in part by tenant labor and in part by migratory seasonal labor,\r\nsummoned from all sections of the country for the harvests. The mineral\r\nresources created hundreds of huge fortunes which made the accumulations\r\nof eastern mercantile families look trivial by comparison. Other\r\nmillionaires won their fortunes in the railway business and still more\r\nfrom the cattle and sheep ranges. In many sections the \"cattle king,\" as\r\nhe was called, was as dominant as the planter had been in the old South.\r\nEverywhere in the grazing country he was a conspicuous and important\r\nperson. He \"sometimes invested money in banks, in railroad stocks, or in\r\ncity property.... He had his rating in the commercial reviews and could\r\nhobnob with bankers, railroad presidents, and metropolitan merchants....\r\nHe attended party caucuses and conventions, ran for the state\r\nlegislature, and sometimes defeated a lawyer or metropolitan 'business\r\nman' in the race for a seat in Congress. In proportion to their numbers,\r\nthe ranchers ... have constituted a highly impressive class.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the early capitalists of the great West, especially\r\nfrom Nevada, spent their money principally in the East, others took\r\nleadership in promoting the sections in which they had made their\r\nfortunes. A railroad pioneer, General Palmer, built his home at Colorado\r\nSprings, founded the town, and encouraged local improvements. Denver\r\nowed its first impressive buildings to the civic patriotism of Horace\r\nTabor, a wealthy mine owner. Leland Stanford paid his tribute to\r\nCalifornia in the endowment of a large university. Colonel W.F. Cody,\r\nbetter known as \"Buffalo Bill,\" started his career by building a \"boom\r\ntown\" which collapsed, and made a large sum of money supplying buffalo\r\nmeat to construction hands (hence his popular name). By his famous Wild\r\nWest Show, he increased it to a fortune which he devoted mainly to the\r\npromotion of a western reclamation scheme.\r\n\r\nWhile the Far West was developing this vigorous, aggressive leadership\r\nin business, a considerable industrial population was springing up. Even\r\nthe cattle ranges and hundreds of farms were conducted like factories in\r\nthat they were managed through overseers who hired plowmen, harvesters,\r\nand cattlemen at regular wages. At the same time there appeared other\r\npeculiar features which made a lasting impression on western economic\r\nlife. Mining, lumbering, and fruit growing, for instance, employed\r\nthousands of workers during the rush months and turned them out at other\r\ntimes. The inevitable result was an army of migratory laborers wandering\r\nfrom camp to camp, from town to town, and from ranch to ranch, without\r\nfixed homes or established habits of life. From this extraordinary\r\ncondition there issued many a long and lawless conflict between capital\r\nand labor, giving a distinct color to the labor movement in whole\r\nsections of the mountain and coast states.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADMISSION OF NEW STATES\r\n\r\n=The Spirit of Self-Government.=--The instinct of self-government was\r\nstrong in the western communities. In the very beginning, it led to the\r\norganization of volunteer committees, known as \"vigilantes,\" to suppress\r\ncrime and punish criminals. As soon as enough people were settled\r\npermanently in a region, they took care to form a more stable kind of\r\ngovernment. An illustration of this process is found in the Oregon\r\ncompact made by the pioneers in 1843, the spirit of which is reflected\r\nin an editorial in an old copy of the _Rocky Mountain News_: \"We claim\r\nthat any body or community of American citizens which from any cause or\r\nunder any circumstances is cut off from or from isolation is so situated\r\nas not to be under any active and protecting branch of the central\r\ngovernment, have a right, if on American soil, to frame a government and\r\nenact such laws and regulations as may be necessary for their own\r\nsafety, protection, and happiness, always with the condition precedent,\r\nthat they shall, at the earliest moment when the central government\r\nshall extend an effective organization and laws over them, give it their\r\nunqualified support and obedience.\"\r\n\r\nPeople who turned so naturally to the organization of local\r\nadministration were equally eager for admission to the union as soon as\r\nany shadow of a claim to statehood could be advanced. As long as a\r\nregion was merely one of the territories of the United States, the\r\nappointment of the governor and other officers was controlled by\r\npolitics at Washington. Moreover the disposition of land, mineral\r\nrights, forests, and water power was also in the hands of national\r\nleaders. Thus practical considerations were united with the spirit of\r\nindependence in the quest for local autonomy.\r\n\r\n=Nebraska and Colorado.=--Two states, Nebraska and Colorado, had little\r\ndifficulty in securing admission to the union. The first, Nebraska, had\r\nbeen organized as a territory by the famous Kansas-Nebraska bill which\r\ndid so much to precipitate the Civil War. Lying to the north of Kansas,\r\nwhich had been admitted in 1861, it escaped the invasion of slave owners\r\nfrom Missouri and was settled mainly by farmers from the North. Though\r\nit claimed a population of only 67,000, it was regarded with kindly\r\ninterest by the Republican Congress at Washington and, reduced to its\r\npresent boundaries, it received the coveted statehood in 1867.\r\n\r\nThis was hardly accomplished before the people of Colorado to the\r\nsouthwest began to make known their demands. They had been organized\r\nunder territorial government in 1861 when they numbered only a handful;\r\nbut within ten years the aspect of their affairs had completely changed.\r\nThe silver and gold deposits of the Leadville and Cripple Creek regions\r\nhad attracted an army of miners and prospectors. The city of Denver,\r\nfounded in 1858 and named after the governor of Kansas whence came many\r\nof the early settlers, had grown from a straggling camp of log huts into\r\na prosperous center of trade. By 1875 it was reckoned that the\r\npopulation of the territory was not less than one hundred thousand; the\r\nfollowing year Congress, yielding to the popular appeal, made Colorado a\r\nmember of the American union.\r\n\r\n=Six New States (1889-1890).=--For many years there was a deadlock in\r\nCongress over the admission of new states. The spell was broken in 1889\r\nunder the leadership of the Dakotas. For a long time the Dakota\r\nterritory, organized in 1861, had been looked upon as the home of the\r\npowerful Sioux Indians whose enormous reservation blocked the advance of\r\nthe frontier. The discovery of gold in the Black Hills, however, marked\r\ntheir doom. Even before Congress could open their lands to prospectors,\r\npioneers were swarming over the country. Farmers from the adjoining\r\nMinnesota and the Eastern states, Scandinavians, Germans, and Canadians,\r\ncame in swelling waves to occupy the fertile Dakota lands, now famous\r\neven as far away as the fjords of Norway. Seldom had the plow of man cut\r\nthrough richer soil than was found in the bottoms of the Red River\r\nValley, and it became all the more precious when the opening of the\r\nNorthern Pacific in 1883 afforded a means of transportation east and\r\nwest. The population, which had numbered 135,000 in 1880, passed the\r\nhalf million mark before ten years had elapsed.\r\n\r\nRemembering that Nebraska had been admitted with only 67,000\r\ninhabitants, the Dakotans could not see why they should be kept under\r\nfederal tutelage. At the same time Washington, far away on the Pacific\r\nCoast, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, boasting of their populations and\r\ntheir riches, put in their own eloquent pleas. But the members of\r\nCongress were busy with politics. The Democrats saw no good reason for\r\nadmitting new Republican states until after their defeat in 1888. Near\r\nthe end of their term the next year they opened the door for North and\r\nSouth Dakota, Washington, and Montana. In 1890, a Republican Congress\r\nbrought Idaho and Wyoming into the union, the latter with woman\r\nsuffrage, which had been granted twenty-one years before.\r\n\r\n=Utah.=--Although Utah had long presented all the elements of a\r\nwell-settled and industrious community, its admission to the union was\r\ndelayed on account of popular hostility to the practice of polygamy. The\r\ncustom, it is true, had been prohibited by act of Congress in 1862; but\r\nthe law had been systematically evaded. In 1882 Congress made another\r\nand more effective effort to stamp out polygamy. Five years later it\r\neven went so far as to authorize the confiscation of the property of the\r\nMormon Church in case the practice of plural marriages was not stopped.\r\nMeanwhile the Gentile or non-Mormon population was steadily increasing\r\nand the leaders in the Church became convinced that the battle\r\nagainst the sentiment of the country was futile. At last in 1896 Utah\r\nwas admitted as a state under a constitution which forbade plural\r\nmarriages absolutely and forever. Horace Greeley, who visited Utah in\r\n1859, had prophesied that the Pacific Railroad would work a revolution\r\nin the land of Brigham Young. His prophecy had come true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES IN 1912]\r\n\r\n=Rounding out the Continent.=--Three more territories now remained out\r\nof the Union. Oklahoma, long an Indian reservation, had been opened for\r\nsettlement to white men in 1889. The rush upon the fertile lands of this\r\nregion, the last in the history of America, was marked by all the frenzy\r\nof the final, desperate chance. At a signal from a bugle an army of men\r\nwith families in wagons, men and women on horseback and on foot, burst\r\ninto the territory. During the first night a city of tents was raised at\r\nGuthrie and Oklahoma City. In ten days wooden houses rose on the plains.\r\nIn a single year there were schools, churches, business blocks, and\r\nnewspapers. Within fifteen years there was a population of more than\r\nhalf a million. To the west, Arizona with a population of about 125,000\r\nand New Mexico with 200,000 inhabitants joined Oklahoma in asking for\r\nstatehood. Congress, then Republican, looked with reluctance upon the\r\naddition of more Democratic states; but in 1907 it was literally\r\ncompelled by public sentiment and a sense of justice to admit Oklahoma.\r\nIn 1910 the House of Representatives went to the Democrats and within\r\ntwo years Arizona and New Mexico were \"under the roof.\" So the\r\ncontinental domain was rounded out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF THE FAR WEST ON NATIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\n=The Last of the Frontier.=--When Horace Greeley made his trip west in\r\n1859 he thus recorded the progress of civilization in his journal:\r\n\r\n     \"May 12th, Chicago.--Chocolate and morning journals last\r\n     seen on the hotel breakfast table.\r\n\r\n     23rd, Leavenworth (Kansas).--Room bells and bath tubs make\r\n     their final appearance.\r\n\r\n     26th, Manhattan.--Potatoes and eggs last recognized among\r\n     the blessings that 'brighten as they take their flight.'\r\n\r\n     27th, Junction City.--Last visitation of a boot-black, with\r\n     dissolving views of a board bedroom. Beds bid us good-by.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Panama-California Exposition_\r\n\r\nTHE CANADIAN BUILDING AT THE PANAMA-CALIFORNIA INTERNATIONAL\r\nEXPOSITION, SAN DIEGO, 1915]\r\n\r\nWithin thirty years travelers were riding across that country in Pullman\r\ncars and enjoying at the hotels all the comforts of a standardized\r\ncivilization. The \"wild west\" was gone, and with it that frontier of\r\npioneers and settlers who had long given such a bent and tone to\r\nAmerican life and had \"poured in upon the floor of Congress\" such a long\r\nline of \"backwoods politicians,\" as they were scornfully styled.\r\n\r\n=Free Land and Eastern Labor.=--It was not only the picturesque features\r\nof the frontier that were gone. Of far more consequence was the\r\ndisappearance of free lands with all that meant for American labor. For\r\nmore than a hundred years, any man of even moderate means had been able\r\nto secure a homestead of his own and an independent livelihood. For a\r\nhundred years America had been able to supply farms to as many\r\nimmigrants as cared to till the soil. Every new pair of strong arms\r\nmeant more farms and more wealth. Workmen in Eastern factories, mines,\r\nor mills who did not like their hours, wages, or conditions of labor,\r\ncould readily find an outlet to the land. Now all that was over. By\r\nabout 1890 most of the desirable land available under the Homestead act\r\nhad disappeared. American industrial workers confronted a new situation.\r\n\r\n=Grain Supplants King Cotton.=--In the meantime a revolution was taking\r\nplace in agriculture. Until 1860 the chief staples sold by America were\r\ncotton and tobacco. With the advance of the frontier, corn and wheat\r\nsupplanted them both in agrarian economy. The West became the granary of\r\nthe East and of Western Europe. The scoop shovel once used to handle\r\ngrain was superseded by the towering elevator, loading and unloading\r\nthousands of bushels every hour. The refrigerator car and ship made the\r\npacking industry as stable as the production of cotton or corn, and gave\r\nan immense impetus to cattle raising and sheep farming. So the meat of\r\nthe West took its place on the English dinner table by the side of bread\r\nbaked from Dakotan wheat.\r\n\r\n=Aid in American Economic Independence.=--The effects of this economic\r\nmovement were manifold and striking. Billions of dollars' worth of\r\nAmerican grain, dairy produce, and meat were poured into European\r\nmarkets where they paid off debts due money lenders and acquired\r\ncapital to develop American resources. Thus they accelerated the\r\nprogress of American financiers toward national independence. The\r\ncountry, which had timidly turned to the Old World for capital in\r\nHamilton's day and had borrowed at high rates of interest in London in\r\nLincoln's day, moved swiftly toward the time when it would be among the\r\nworld's first bankers and money lenders itself. Every grain of wheat and\r\ncorn pulled the balance down on the American side of the scale.\r\n\r\n=Eastern Agriculture Affected.=--In the East as well as abroad the\r\nopening of the western granary produced momentous results. The\r\nagricultural economy of that part of the country was changed in many\r\nrespects. Whole sections of the poorest land went almost out of\r\ncultivation, the abandoned farms of the New England hills bearing solemn\r\nwitness to the competing power of western wheat fields. Sheep and cattle\r\nraising, as well as wheat and corn production, suffered at least a\r\nrelative decline. Thousands of farmers cultivating land of the lower\r\ngrade were forced to go West or were driven to the margin of\r\nsubsistence. Even the herds that supplied Eastern cities with milk were\r\nfed upon grain brought halfway across the continent.\r\n\r\n=The Expansion of the American Market.=--Upon industry as well as\r\nagriculture, the opening of vast food-producing regions told in a\r\nthousand ways. The demand for farm machinery, clothing, boots, shoes,\r\nand other manufactures gave to American industries such a market as even\r\nHamilton had never foreseen. Moreover it helped to expand far into the\r\nMississippi Valley the industrial area once confined to the Northern\r\nseaboard states and to transform the region of the Great Lakes into an\r\nindustrial empire. Herein lies the explanation of the growth of\r\nmid-western cities after 1865. Chicago, with its thirty-five railways,\r\ntapped every locality of the West and South. To the railways were added\r\nthe water routes of the Lakes, thus creating a strategic center for\r\nindustries. Long foresight carried the McCormick reaper works to\r\nChicago before 1860. From Troy, New York, went a large stove plant. That\r\nwas followed by a shoe factory from Massachusetts. The packing industry\r\nrose as a matter of course at a point so advantageous for cattle raisers\r\nand shippers and so well connected with Eastern markets.\r\n\r\nTo the opening of the Far West also the Lake region was indebted for a\r\nlarge part of that water-borne traffic which made it \"the Mediterranean\r\nbasin of North America.\" The produce of the West and the manufactures of\r\nthe East poured through it in an endless stream. The swift growth of\r\nshipbuilding on the Great Lakes helped to compensate for the decline of\r\nthe American marine on the high seas. In response to this stimulus\r\nDetroit could boast that her shipwrights were able to turn out a ten\r\nthousand ton Leviathan for ore or grain about \"as quickly as carpenters\r\ncould put up an eight-room house.\" Thus in relation to the Far West the\r\nold Northwest territory--the wilderness of Jefferson's time--had taken\r\nthe position formerly occupied by New England alone. It was supplying\r\ncapital and manufactures for a vast agricultural empire West and South.\r\n\r\n=America on the Pacific.=--It has been said that the Mediterranean Sea\r\nwas the center of ancient civilization; that modern civilization has\r\ndeveloped on the shores of the Atlantic; and that the future belongs to\r\nthe Pacific. At any rate, the sweep of the United States to the shores\r\nof the Pacific quickly exercised a powerful influence on world affairs\r\nand it undoubtedly has a still greater significance for the future.\r\n\r\nVery early regular traffic sprang up between the Pacific ports and the\r\nHawaiian Islands, China, and Japan. Two years before the adjustment of\r\nthe Oregon controversy with England, namely in 1844, the United States\r\nhad established official and trading relations with China. Ten years\r\nlater, four years after the admission of California to the union, the\r\nbarred door of Japan was forced open by Commodore Perry. The commerce\r\nwhich had long before developed between the Pacific ports and Hawaii,\r\nChina, and Japan now flourished under official care. In 1865 a ship\r\nfrom Honolulu carried sugar, molasses, and fruits from Hawaii to the\r\nOregon port of Astoria. The next year a vessel from Hongkong brought\r\nrice, mats, and tea from China. An era of lucrative trade was opened.\r\nThe annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the addition of the Philippines at the\r\nsame time, and the participation of American troops in the suppression\r\nof the Boxer rebellion in Peking in 1900, were but signs and symbols of\r\nAmerican power on the Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _From an old print_\r\n\r\nCOMMODORE PERRY'S MEN MAKING PRESENTS TO THE JAPANESE]\r\n\r\n=Conservation and the Land Problem.=--The disappearance of the frontier\r\nalso brought new and serious problems to the governments of the states\r\nand the nation. The people of the whole United States suddenly were\r\nforced to realize that there was a limit to the rich, new land to\r\nexploit and to the forests and minerals awaiting the ax and the pick.\r\nThen arose in America the questions which had long perplexed the\r\ncountries of the Old World--the scientific use of the soils and\r\nconservation of natural resources. Hitherto the government had followed\r\nthe easy path of giving away arable land and selling forest and mineral\r\nlands at low prices. Now it had to face far more difficult and complex\r\nproblems. It also had to consider questions of land tenure again,\r\nespecially if the ideal of a nation of home-owning farmers was to be\r\nmaintained. While there was plenty of land for every man or woman who\r\nwanted a home on the soil, it made little difference if single landlords\r\nor companies got possession of millions of acres, if a hundred men in\r\none western river valley owned 17,000,000 acres; but when the good land\r\nfor small homesteads was all gone, then was raised the real issue. At\r\nthe opening of the twentieth century the nation, which a hundred years\r\nbefore had land and natural resources apparently without limit, was\r\ncompelled to enact law after law conserving its forests and minerals.\r\nThen it was that the great state of California, on the very border of\r\nthe continent, felt constrained to enact a land settlement measure\r\nproviding government assistance in an effort to break up large holdings\r\ninto small lots and to make it easy for actual settlers to acquire small\r\nfarms. America was passing into a new epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nHenry Inman, _The Old Santa Fé Trail_.\r\n\r\nR.I. Dodge, _The Plains of the Great West_ (1877).\r\n\r\nC.H.

During none\r\nof that time was there a clash of opinion over specific issues such as\r\nrent the country in 1800 when Jefferson rode a popular wave to victory,\r\nor again in 1828 when Jackson's western hordes came sweeping into power.\r\nThe Democrats, who before 1860 definitely opposed protective tariffs,\r\nfederal banking, internal improvements, and heavy taxes, now spoke\r\ncautiously on all these points. The Republicans, conscious of the fact\r\nthat they had been a minority of the voters in 1860 and warned by the\r\nearly loss of the House of Representatives in 1874, also moved with\r\nconsiderable prudence among the perplexing problems of the day. Again\r\nand again the votes in Congress showed that no clear line separated all\r\nthe Democrats from all the Republicans. There were Republicans who\r\nfavored tariff reductions and \"cheap money.\" There were Democrats who\r\nlooked with partiality upon high protection or with indulgence upon the\r\ncontraction of the currency. Only on matters relating to the coercion of\r\nthe South was the division between the parties fairly definite; this\r\ncould be readily accounted for on practical as well as sentimental\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the vague criticisms and proposals that found their way into\r\nthe political platforms did but reflect the confusion of mind prevailing\r\nin the country. The fact that, out of the eighteen years between 1875\r\nand 1893, the Democrats held the House of Representatives for fourteen\r\nyears while the Republicans had every President but one showed that the\r\nvoters, like the politicians, were in a state of indecision. Hayes had a\r\nDemocratic House during his entire term and a Democratic Senate for two\r\nyears of the four. Cleveland was confronted by a belligerent Republican\r\nmajority in the Senate during his first administration; and at the same\r\ntime was supported by a Democratic majority in the House. Harrison was\r\nsustained by continuous Republican successes in Senatorial elections;\r\nbut in the House he had the barest majority from 1889 to 1891 and lost\r\nthat altogether at the election held in the middle of his term. The\r\nopinion of the country was evidently unsettled and fluctuating. It was\r\nstill distracted by memories of the dead past and uncertain as to the\r\ntrend of the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURRENCY QUESTION\r\n\r\nNevertheless these years of muddled politics and nebulous issues proved\r\nto be a period in which social forces were gathering for the great\r\ncampaign of 1896. Except for three new features--the railways, the\r\ntrusts, and the trade unions--the subjects of debate among the people\r\nwere the same as those that had engaged their attention since the\r\nfoundation of the republic: the currency, the national debt, banking,\r\nthe tariff, and taxation.\r\n\r\n=Debtors and the Fall in Prices.=--For many reasons the currency\r\nquestion occupied the center of interest. As of old, the farmers and\r\nplanters of the West and South were heavily in debt to the East for\r\nborrowed money secured by farm mortgages; and they counted upon the sale\r\nof cotton, corn, wheat, and hogs to meet interest and principal when\r\ndue. During the war, the Western farmers had been able to dispose of\r\ntheir produce at high prices and thus discharge their debts with\r\ncomparative ease; but after the war prices declined. Wheat that sold at\r\ntwo dollars a bushel in 1865 brought sixty-four cents twenty years\r\nlater. The meaning of this for the farmers in debt--and nearly\r\nthree-fourths of them were in that class--can be shown by a single\r\nillustration. A thousand-dollar mortgage on a Western farm could be paid\r\noff by five hundred bushels of wheat when prices were high; whereas it\r\ntook about fifteen hundred bushels to pay the same debt when wheat was\r\nat the bottom of the scale. For the farmer, it must be remembered, wheat\r\nwas the measure of his labor, the product of his toil under the summer\r\nsun; and in its price he found the test of his prosperity.\r\n\r\n=Creditors and Falling Prices.=--To the bondholders or creditors, on the\r\nother hand, falling prices were clear gain. If a fifty-dollar coupon on\r\na bond bought seventy or eighty bushels of wheat instead of twenty or\r\nthirty, the advantage to the owner of the coupon was obvious. Moreover\r\nthe advantage seemed to him entirely just. Creditors had suffered heavy\r\nlosses when the Civil War carried prices skyward while the interest\r\nrates on their old bonds remained stationary. For example, if a man had\r\na $1000 bond issued before 1860 and paying interest at five per cent, he\r\nreceived fifty dollars a year from it. Before the war each dollar would\r\nbuy a bushel of wheat; in 1865 it would only buy half a bushel. When\r\nprices--that is, the cost of living--began to go down, creditors\r\ntherefore generally regarded the change with satisfaction as a return to\r\nnormal conditions.\r\n\r\n=The Cause of Falling Prices.=--The fall in prices was due, no doubt, to\r\nmany factors. Among them must be reckoned the discontinuance of\r\ngovernment buying for war purposes, labor-saving farm machinery,\r\nimmigration, and the opening of new wheat-growing regions. The currency,\r\ntoo, was an element in the situation. Whatever the cause, the\r\ndiscontented farmers believed that the way to raise prices was to issue\r\nmore money. They viewed it as a case of supply and demand. If there was\r\na small volume of currency in circulation, prices would be low; if there\r\nwas a large volume, prices would be high. Hence they looked with favor\r\nupon all plans to increase the amount of money in circulation. First\r\nthey advocated more paper notes--greenbacks--and then they turned to\r\nsilver as the remedy. The creditors, on the other hand, naturally\r\napproved the reduction of the volume of currency. They wished to see the\r\ngreenbacks withdrawn from circulation and gold--a metal more limited in\r\nvolume than silver--made the sole basis of the national monetary system.\r\n\r\n=The Battle over the Greenbacks.=--The contest between these factions\r\nbegan as early as 1866. In that year, Congress enacted a law authorizing\r\nthe Treasury to withdraw the greenbacks from circulation. The paper\r\nmoney party set up a shrill cry of protest, and kept up the fight until,\r\nin 1878, it forced Congress to provide for the continuous re-issue of\r\nthe legal tender notes as they came into the Treasury in payment of\r\ntaxes and other dues. Then could the friends of easy money rejoice:\r\n\r\n    \"Thou, Greenback, 'tis of thee\r\n     Fair money of the free,\r\n      Of thee we sing.\"\r\n\r\n=Resumption of Specie Payment.=--There was, however, another side to\r\nthis victory. The opponents of the greenbacks, unable to stop the\r\ncirculation of paper, induced Congress to pass a law in 1875 providing\r\nthat on and after January 1, 1879, \"the Secretary of the Treasury shall\r\nredeem in coin the United States legal tender notes then outstanding on\r\ntheir presentation at the office of the Assistant Treasurer of the\r\nUnited States in the City of New York in sums of not less than fifty\r\ndollars.\" \"The way to resume,\" John Sherman had said, \"is to resume.\"\r\nWhen the hour for redemption arrived, the Treasury was prepared with a\r\nlarge hoard of gold. \"On the appointed day,\" wrote the assistant\r\nsecretary, \"anxiety reigned in the office of the Treasury. Hour after\r\nhour passed; no news from New York. Inquiry by wire showed that all was\r\nquiet. At the close of the day this message came: '$135,000 of notes\r\npresented for coin--$400,000 of gold for notes.' That was all.\r\nResumption was accomplished with no disturbance. By five o'clock the\r\nnews was all over the land, and the New York bankers were sipping their\r\ntea in absolute safety.\"\r\n\r\n=The Specie Problem--the Parity of Gold and Silver.=--Defeated in their\r\nefforts to stop \"the present suicidal and destructive policy of\r\ncontraction,\" the advocates of an abundant currency demanded an increase\r\nin the volume of silver in circulation. This precipitated one of the\r\nsharpest political battles in American history. The issue turned on\r\nlegal as well as economic points. The Constitution gave Congress the\r\npower to coin money and it forbade the states to make anything but gold\r\nand silver legal tender in the payment of debts. It evidently\r\ncontemplated the use of both metals in the currency system. Such, at\r\nleast, was the view of many eminent statesmen, including no less a\r\npersonage than James G. Blaine. The difficulty, however, lay in\r\nmaintaining gold and silver coins on a level which would permit them to\r\ncirculate with equal facility. Obviously, if the gold in a gold dollar\r\nexceeds the value of the silver in a silver dollar on the open market,\r\nmen will hoard gold money and leave silver money in circulation. When,\r\nfor example, Congress in 1792 fixed the ratio of the two metals at one\r\nto fifteen--one ounce of gold declared worth fifteen of silver--it was\r\nsoon found that gold had been undervalued. When again in 1834 the ratio\r\nwas put at one to sixteen, it was found that silver was undervalued.\r\nConsequently the latter metal was not brought in for coinage and silver\r\nalmost dropped out of circulation. Many a silver dollar was melted down\r\nby silverware factories.\r\n\r\n=Silver Demonetized in 1873.=--So things stood in 1873. At that time,\r\nCongress, in enacting a mintage law, discontinued the coinage of the\r\nstandard silver dollar, then practically out of circulation. This act\r\nwas denounced later by the friends of silver as \"the crime of '73,\" a\r\nconspiracy devised by the money power and secretly carried out. This\r\ncontention the debates in Congress do not seem to sustain. In the course\r\nof the argument on the mint law it was distinctly said by one speaker at\r\nleast: \"This bill provides for the making of changes in the legal tender\r\ncoin of the country and for substituting as legal tender, coin of only\r\none metal instead of two as heretofore.\"\r\n\r\n=The Decline in the Value of Silver.=--Absorbed in the greenback\r\ncontroversy, the people apparently did not appreciate, at the time, the\r\nsignificance of the \"demonetization\" of silver; but within a few years\r\nseveral events united in making it the center of a political storm.\r\nGermany, having abandoned silver in 1871, steadily increased her demand\r\nfor gold. Three years later, the countries of the Latin Union followed\r\nthis example, thus helping to enhance the price of the yellow metal. All\r\nthe while, new silver lodes, discovered in the Far West, were pouring\r\ninto the market great streams of the white metal, bearing down the\r\nprice. Then came the resumption of specie payment, which, in effect,\r\nplaced the paper money on a gold basis. Within twenty years silver was\r\nworth in gold only about half the price of 1870.\r\n\r\nThat there had been a real decline in silver was denied by the friends\r\nof that metal. They alleged that gold had gone up because it had been\r\ngiven a monopoly in the coinage markets of civilized governments. This\r\nmonopoly, they continued, was the fruit of a conspiracy against the\r\npeople conceived by the bankers of the world. Moreover, they went on,\r\nthe placing of the greenbacks on a gold basis had itself worked a\r\ncontraction of the currency; it lowered the prices of labor and produce\r\nto the advantage of the holders of long-term investments bearing a fixed\r\nrate of interest. When wheat sold at sixty-four cents a bushel, their\r\nsearch for relief became desperate, and they at last concentrated their\r\nefforts on opening the mints of the government for the free coinage of\r\nsilver at the ratio of sixteen to one.\r\n\r\n=Republicans and Democrats Divided.=--On this question both Republicans\r\nand Democrats were divided, the line being drawn between the East on the\r\none hand and the South and West on the other, rather than between the\r\ntwo leading parties. So trusted a leader as James G. Blaine avowed, in a\r\nspeech delivered in the Senate in 1878, that, as the Constitution\r\nrequired Congress to make both gold and silver the money of the land,\r\nthe only question left was that of fixing the ratio between them. He\r\naffirmed, moreover, the main contention of the silver faction that a\r\nreopening of the government mints of the world to silver would bring it\r\nup to its old relation with gold. He admitted also that their most\r\nominous warnings were well founded, saying: \"I believe the struggle now\r\ngoing on in this country and in other countries for a single gold\r\nstandard would, if successful, produce widespread disaster throughout\r\nthe commercial world. The destruction of silver as money and the\r\nestablishment of gold as the sole unit of value must have a ruinous\r\neffect on all forms of property, except those investments which yield a\r\nfixed return.\"\r\n\r\nThis was exactly the concession that the silver party wanted.\r\n\"Three-fourths of the business enterprises of this country are conducted\r\non borrowed capital,\" said Senator Jones, of Nevada. \"Three-fourths of\r\nthe homes and farms that stand in the names of the actual occupants have\r\nbeen bought on time and a very large proportion of them are mortgaged\r\nfor the payment of some part of the purchase money. Under the operation\r\nof a shrinkage in the volume of money, this enormous mass of borrowers,\r\nat the maturity of their respective debts, though nominally paying no\r\nmore than the amount borrowed, with interest, are in reality, in the\r\namount of the principal alone, returning a percentage of value greater\r\nthan they received--more in equity than they contracted to pay.... In\r\nall discussions of the subject the creditors attempt to brush aside the\r\nequities involved by sneering at the debtors.\"\r\n\r\n=The Silver Purchase Act (1878).=--Even before the actual resumption of\r\nspecie payment, the advocates of free silver were a power to be reckoned\r\nwith, particularly in the Democratic party. They had a majority in the\r\nHouse of Representatives in 1878 and they carried a silver bill through\r\nthat chamber. Blocked by the Republican Senate they accepted a\r\ncompromise in the Bland-Allison bill, which provided for huge monthly\r\npurchases of silver by the government for coinage into dollars. So\r\nstrong was the sentiment that a two-thirds majority was mustered after\r\nPresident Hayes vetoed the measure.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this act, as some had anticipated, was disappointing. It\r\ndid not stay silver on its downward course. Thereupon the silver faction\r\npressed through Congress in 1886 a bill providing for the issue of paper\r\ncertificates based on the silver accumulated in the Treasury. Still\r\nsilver continued to fall. Then the advocates of inflation declared that\r\nthey would be content with nothing short of free coinage at the ratio of\r\nsixteen to one. If the issue had been squarely presented in 1890, there\r\nis good reason for believing that free silver would have received a\r\nmajority in both houses of Congress; but it was not presented.\r\n\r\n=The Sherman Silver Purchase Act and the Bond Sales.=--Republican\r\nleaders, particularly from the East, stemmed the silver tide by a\r\ndiversion of forces. They passed the Sherman Act of 1890 providing for\r\nlarge monthly purchases of silver and for the issue of notes redeemable\r\nin gold or silver at the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury. In\r\na clause of superb ambiguity they announced that it was \"the established\r\npolicy of the United States to maintain the two metals on a parity with\r\neach other upon the present legal ratio or such other ratio as may be\r\nprovided by law.\" For a while silver was buoyed up. Then it turned once\r\nmore on its downward course. In the meantime the Treasury was in a sad\r\nplight. To maintain the gold reserve, President Cleveland felt compelled\r\nto sell government bonds; and to his dismay he found that as soon as the\r\ngold was brought in at the front door of the Treasury, notes were\r\npresented for redemption and the gold was quickly carried out at the\r\nback door. Alarmed at the vicious circle thus created, he urged upon\r\nCongress the repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. For this he was\r\nroundly condemned by many of his own followers who branded his conduct\r\nas \"treason to the party\"; but the Republicans, especially from the\r\nEast, came to his rescue and in 1893 swept the troublesome sections of\r\nthe law from the statute book. The anger of the silver faction knew no\r\nbounds, and the leaders made ready for the approaching presidential\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROTECTIVE TARIFF AND TAXATION\r\n\r\n=Fluctuation in Tariff Policy.=--As each of the old parties was divided\r\non the currency question, it is not surprising that there was some\r\nconfusion in their ranks over the tariff. Like the silver issue, the\r\ntariff tended to align the manufacturing East against the agricultural\r\nWest and South rather than to cut directly between the two parties.\r\nStill the Republicans on the whole stood firmly by the rates imposed\r\nduring the Civil War. If we except the reductions of 1872 which were\r\nsoon offset by increases, we may say that those rates were substantially\r\nunchanged for nearly twenty years. When a revision was brought about,\r\nhowever, it was initiated by Republican leaders. Seeing a huge surplus\r\nof revenue in the Treasury in 1883, they anticipated popular clamor by\r\nrevising the tariff on the theory that it ought to be reformed by its\r\nfriends rather than by its enemies. On the other hand, it was the\r\nRepublicans also who enacted the McKinley tariff bill of 1890, which\r\ncarried protection to its highest point up to that time.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats on their part were not all confirmed free traders or even\r\nadvocates of tariff for revenue only. In Cleveland's first\r\nadministration they did attack the protective system in the House, where\r\nthey had a majority, and in this they were vigorously supported by the\r\nPresident. The assault, however, proved to be a futile gesture for it\r\nwas blocked by the Republicans in the Senate. When, after the sweeping\r\nvictory of 1892, the Democrats in the House again attempted to bring\r\ndown the tariff by the Wilson bill of 1894, they were checkmated by\r\ntheir own party colleagues in the upper chamber. In the end they were\r\ndriven into a compromise that looked more like a McKinley than a Calhoun\r\ntariff. The Republicans taunted them with being \"babes in the woods.\"\r\nPresident Cleveland was so dissatisfied with the bill that he refused to\r\nsign it, allowing it to become a law, on the lapse of ten days, without\r\nhis approval.\r\n\r\n=The Income Tax of 1894.=--The advocates of tariff reduction usually\r\nassociated with their proposal a tax on incomes. The argument which\r\nthey advanced in support of their program was simple. Most of the\r\nindustries, they said, are in the East and the protective tariff which\r\ntaxes consumers for the benefit of manufacturers is, in effect, a\r\ntribute laid upon the rest of the country. As an offset they offered a\r\ntax on large incomes; this owing to the heavy concentration of rich\r\npeople in the East, would fall mainly upon the beneficiaries of\r\nprotection. \"We propose,\" said one of them, \"to place a part of the\r\nburden upon the accumulated wealth of the country instead of placing it\r\nall upon the consumption of the people.\" In this spirit the sponsors of\r\nthe Wilson tariff bill laid a tax upon all incomes of $4000 a year or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn taking this step, the Democrats encountered opposition in their own\r\nparty. Senator Hill, of New York, turned fiercely upon them, exclaiming:\r\n\"The professors with their books, the socialists with their schemes, the\r\nanarchists with their bombs are all instructing the people in the ...\r\nprinciples of taxation.\" Even the Eastern Republicans were hardly as\r\nsavage in their denunciation of the tax. But all this labor was wasted.\r\nThe next year the Supreme Court of the United States declared the income\r\ntax to be a direct tax, and therefore null and void because it was laid\r\non incomes wherever found and not apportioned among the states according\r\nto population. The fact that four of the nine judges dissented from this\r\ndecision was also an index to the diversity of opinion that divided both\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAYS AND TRUSTS\r\n\r\n=The Grangers and State Regulation.=--The same uncertainty about the\r\nrailways and trusts pervaded the ranks of the Republicans and Democrats.\r\nAs to the railways, the first firm and consistent demand for their\r\nregulation came from the West. There the farmers, in the early\r\nseventies, having got control in state legislatures, particularly in\r\nIowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois, enacted drastic laws prescribing the\r\nmaximum charges which companies could make for carrying freight and\r\npassengers. The application of these measures, however, was limited\r\nbecause the state could not fix the rates for transporting goods and\r\npassengers beyond its own borders. The power of regulating interstate\r\ncommerce, under the Constitution, belonged to Congress.\r\n\r\n=The Interstate Commerce Act of 1887.=--Within a few years, the movement\r\nwhich had been so effective in western legislatures appeared at\r\nWashington in the form of demands for the federal regulation of\r\ninterstate rates. In 1887, the pressure became so strong that Congress\r\ncreated the interstate commerce commission and forbade many abuses on\r\nthe part of railways; such as discriminating in charges between one\r\nshipper and another and granting secret rebates to favored persons. This\r\nlaw was a significant beginning; but it left the main question of\r\nrate-fixing untouched, much to the discontent of farmers and shippers.\r\n\r\n=The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.=--As in the case of the railways,\r\nattacks upon the trusts were first made in state legislatures, where it\r\nbecame the fashion to provide severe penalties for those who formed\r\nmonopolies and \"conspired to enhance prices.\" Republicans and Democrats\r\nunited in the promotion of measures of this kind. As in the case of the\r\nrailways also, the movement to curb the trusts soon had spokesmen at\r\nWashington. Though Blaine had declared that \"trusts were largely a\r\nprivate affair with which neither the President nor any private citizen\r\nhad any particular right to interfere,\" it was a Republican Congress\r\nthat enacted in 1890 the first measure--the Sherman Anti-Trust\r\nLaw--directed against great combinations in business. This act declared\r\nillegal \"every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise,\r\nor conspiracy in restraint of trade and commerce among the several\r\nstates or with foreign nations.\"\r\n\r\n=The Futility of the Anti-Trust Law.=--Whether the Sherman law was\r\ndirected against all combinations or merely those which placed an\r\n\"unreasonable restraint\" on trade and competition was not apparent.\r\nSenator Platt of Connecticut, a careful statesman of the old school,\r\naverred: \"The questions of whether the bill would be operative, of how\r\nit would operate, or whether it was within the power of Congress to\r\nenact it, have been whistled down the wind in this Senate as idle talk\r\nand the whole effort has been to get some bill headed: 'A bill to punish\r\ntrusts,' with which to go to the country.\" Whatever its purpose, its\r\neffect upon existing trusts and upon the formation of new combinations\r\nwas negligible. It was practically unenforced by President Harrison and\r\nPresident Cleveland, in spite of the constant demand for harsh action\r\nagainst \"monopolies.\" It was patent that neither the Republicans nor the\r\nDemocrats were prepared for a war on the trusts to the bitter end.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINOR PARTIES AND UNREST\r\n\r\n=The Demands of Dissenting Parties.=--From the election of 1872, when\r\nHorace Greeley made his ill-fated excursion into politics, onward, there\r\nappeared in each presidential campaign one, and sometimes two or more\r\nparties, stressing issues that appealed mainly to wage-earners and\r\nfarmers. Whether they chose to call themselves Labor Reformers,\r\nGreenbackers, or Anti-monopolists, their slogans and their platforms all\r\npointed in one direction. Even the Prohibitionists, who in 1872 started\r\non their career with a single issue, the abolition of the liquor\r\ntraffic, found themselves making declarations of faith on other matters\r\nand hopelessly split over the money question in 1896.\r\n\r\nA composite view of the platforms put forth by the dissenting parties\r\nfrom the administration of Grant to the close of Cleveland's second term\r\nreveals certain notions common to them all. These included among many\r\nothers: the earliest possible payment of the national debt; regulation\r\nof the rates of railways and telegraph companies; repeal of the specie\r\nresumption act of 1875; the issue of legal tender notes by the\r\ngovernment convertible into interest-bearing obligations on demand;\r\nunlimited coinage of silver as well as gold; a graduated inheritance\r\ntax; legislation to take from \"land, railroad, money, and other gigantic\r\ncorporate monopolies ... the powers they have so corruptly and unjustly\r\nusurped\"; popular or direct election of United States Senators; woman\r\nsuffrage; and a graduated income tax, \"placing the burden of government\r\non those who can best afford to pay instead of laying it on the farmers\r\nand producers.\"\r\n\r\n=Criticism of the Old Parties.=--To this long program of measures the\r\nreformers added harsh and acrid criticism of the old parties and\r\nsometimes, it must be said, of established institutions of government.\r\n\"We denounce,\" exclaimed the Labor party in 1888, \"the Democratic and\r\nRepublican parties as hopelessly and shamelessly corrupt and by reason\r\nof their affiliation with monopolies equally unworthy of the suffrages\r\nof those who do not live upon public plunder.\" \"The United States\r\nSenate,\" insisted the Greenbackers, \"is a body composed largely of\r\naristocratic millionaires who according to their own party papers\r\ngenerally purchased their elections in order to protect the great\r\nmonopolies which they represent.\" Indeed, if their platforms are to be\r\naccepted at face value, the Greenbackers believed that the entire\r\ngovernment had passed out of the hands of the people.\r\n\r\n=The Grangers.=--This unsparing, not to say revolutionary, criticism of\r\nAmerican political life, appealed, it seems, mainly to farmers in the\r\nMiddle West. Always active in politics, they had, before the Civil War,\r\ncast their lot as a rule with one or the other of the leading parties.\r\nIn 1867, however, there grew up among them an association known as the\r\n\"Patrons of Husbandry,\" which was destined to play a large rôle in the\r\npartisan contests of the succeeding decades. This society, which\r\norganized local lodges or \"granges\" on principles of secrecy and\r\nfraternity, was originally designed to promote in a general way the\r\ninterests of the farmers. Its political bearings were apparently not\r\ngrasped at first by its promoters. Yet, appealing as it did to the most\r\nactive and independent spirits among the farmers and gathering to itself\r\nthe strength that always comes from organization, it soon found itself\r\nin the hands of leaders more or less involved in politics. Where a few\r\nvotes are marshaled together in a democracy, there is power.\r\n\r\n=The Greenback Party.=--The first extensive activity of the Grangers was\r\nconnected with the attack on the railways in the Middle West which\r\nforced several state legislatures to reduce freight and passenger rates\r\nby law. At the same time, some leaders in the movement, no doubt\r\nemboldened by this success, launched in 1876 a new political party,\r\npopularly known as the Greenbackers, favoring a continued re-issue of\r\nthe legal tenders. The beginnings were disappointing; but two years\r\nlater, in the congressional elections, the Greenbackers swept whole\r\nsections of the country. Their candidates polled more than a million\r\nvotes and fourteen of them were returned to the House of\r\nRepresentatives. To all outward signs a new and formidable party had\r\nentered the lists.\r\n\r\nThe sanguine hopes of the leaders proved to be illusory. The quiet\r\noperations of the resumption act the following year, a revival of\r\nindustry from a severe panic which had set in during 1873, the Silver\r\nPurchase Act, and the re-issue of Greenbacks cut away some of the\r\ngrounds of agitation. There was also a diversion of forces to the silver\r\nfaction which had a substantial support in the silver mine owners of the\r\nWest. At all events the Greenback vote fell to about 300,000 in the\r\nelection of 1880. A still greater drop came four years later and the\r\nparty gave up the ghost, its sponsors returning to their former\r\nallegiance or sulking in their tents.\r\n\r\n=The Rise of the Populist Party.=--Those leaders of the old parties who\r\nnow looked for a happy future unvexed by new factions were doomed to\r\ndisappointment. The funeral of the Greenback party was hardly over\r\nbefore there arose two other political specters in the agrarian\r\nsections: the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union,\r\nparticularly strong in the South and West; and the Farmers' Alliance,\r\noperating in the North. By 1890 the two orders claimed over three\r\nmillion members. As in the case of the Grangers many years before, the\r\nleaders among them found an easy way into politics. In 1892 they held a\r\nconvention, nominated a candidate for President, and adopted the name of\r\n\"People's Party,\" from which they were known as Populists. Their\r\nplatform, in every line, breathed a spirit of radicalism. They declared\r\nthat \"the newspapers are largely subsidized or muzzled; public opinion\r\nsilenced; business prostrate; our homes covered with mortgages; and the\r\nland concentrating in the hands of capitalists.... The fruits of the\r\ntoil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes for a\r\nfew.\" Having delivered this sweeping indictment, the Populists put\r\nforward their remedies: the free coinage of silver, a graduated income\r\ntax, postal savings banks, and government ownership of railways and\r\ntelegraphs. At the same time they approved the initiative, referendum,\r\nand popular election of Senators, and condemned the use of federal\r\ntroops in labor disputes. On this platform, the Populists polled over a\r\nmillion votes, captured twenty-two presidential electors, and sent a\r\npowerful delegation to Congress.\r\n\r\n=Industrial Distress Augments Unrest.=--The four years intervening\r\nbetween the campaign of 1892 and the next presidential election brought\r\nforth many events which aggravated the ill-feeling expressed in the\r\nportentous platform of Populism. Cleveland, a consistent enemy of free\r\nsilver, gave his powerful support to the gold standard and insisted on\r\nthe repeal of the Silver Purchase Act, thus alienating an increasing\r\nnumber of his own party. In 1893 a grave industrial crisis fell upon the\r\nland: banks and business houses went into bankruptcy with startling\r\nrapidity; factories were closed; idle men thronged the streets hunting\r\nfor work; and the prices of wheat and corn dropped to a ruinous level.\r\nLabor disputes also filled the crowded record. A strike at the Pullman\r\ncar works in Chicago spread to the railways. Disorders ensued. President\r\nCleveland, against the protests of the governor of Illinois, John P.\r\nAltgeld, dispatched troops to the scene of action. The United States\r\ndistrict court at Chicago issued an injunction forbidding the president\r\nof the Railway Union, Eugene V. Debs, or his assistants to interfere\r\nwith the transmission of the mails or interstate commerce in any form.\r\nFor refusing to obey the order, Debs was arrested and imprisoned. With\r\nfederal troops in possession of the field, with their leader in jail,\r\nthe strikers gave up the battle, defeated but not subdued. To cap the\r\nclimax the Supreme Court of the United States, the following year (1895)\r\ndeclared null and void the income tax law just enacted by Congress, thus\r\nfanning the flames of Populist discontent all over the West and South.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUND MONEY BATTLE OF 1896\r\n\r\n=Conservative Men Alarmed.=--Men of conservative thought and leaning in\r\nboth parties were by this time thoroughly disturbed. They looked upon\r\nthe rise of Populism and the growth of labor disputes as the signs of a\r\nrevolutionary spirit, indeed nothing short of a menace to American\r\ninstitutions and ideals. The income tax law of 1894, exclaimed the\r\ndistinguished New York advocate, Joseph H. Choate, in an impassioned\r\nspeech before the Supreme Court, \"is communistic in its purposes and\r\ntendencies and is defended here upon principles as communistic,\r\nsocialistic--what shall I call them--populistic as ever have been\r\naddressed to any political assembly in the world.\" Mr. Justice Field in\r\nthe name of the Court replied: \"The present assault upon capital is but\r\nthe beginning. It will be but the stepping stone to others larger and\r\nmore sweeping till our political conditions will become a war of the\r\npoor against the rich.\" In declaring the income tax unconstitutional, he\r\nbelieved that he was but averting greater evils lurking under its guise.\r\nAs for free silver, nearly all conservative men were united in calling\r\nit a measure of confiscation and repudiation; an effort of the debtors\r\nto pay their obligations with money worth fifty cents on the dollar; the\r\nclimax of villainies openly defended; a challenge to law, order, and\r\nhonor.\r\n\r\n=The Republicans Come Out for the Gold Standard.=--It was among the\r\nRepublicans that this opinion was most widely shared and firmly held. It\r\nwas they who picked up the gauge thrown down by the Populists, though a\r\nhost of Democrats, like Cleveland and Hill of New York, also battled\r\nagainst the growing Populist defection in Democratic ranks. When the\r\nRepublican national convention assembled in 1896, the die was soon\r\ncast; a declaration of opposition to free silver save by international\r\nagreement was carried by a vote of eight to one. The Republican party,\r\nto use the vigorous language of Mr. Lodge, arrayed itself against \"not\r\nonly that organized failure, the Democratic party, but all the wandering\r\nforces of political chaos and social disorder ... in these bitter times\r\nwhen the forces of disorder are loose and the wreckers with their false\r\nlights gather at the shore to lure the ship of state upon the rocks.\"\r\nYet it is due to historic truth to state that McKinley, whom the\r\nRepublicans nominated, had voted in Congress for the free coinage of\r\nsilver, was widely known as a bimetallist, and was only with difficulty\r\npersuaded to accept the unequivocal indorsement of the gold standard\r\nwhich was pressed upon him by his counselors. Having accepted it,\r\nhowever, he proved to be a valiant champion, though his major interest\r\nwas undoubtedly in the protective tariff. To him nothing was more\r\nreprehensible than attempts \"to array class against class, 'the classes\r\nagainst the masses,' section against section, labor against capital,\r\n'the poor against the rich,' or interest against interest.\" Such was the\r\nlanguage of his acceptance speech. The whole program of Populism he now\r\nviewed as a \"sudden, dangerous, and revolutionary assault upon law and\r\norder.\"\r\n\r\n=The Democratic Convention at Chicago.=--Never, save at the great\r\ndisruption on the eve of the Civil War, did a Democratic national\r\nconvention display more feeling than at Chicago in 1896. From the\r\nopening prayer to the last motion before the house, every act, every\r\nspeech, every scene, every resolution evoked passions and sowed\r\ndissensions. Departing from long party custom, it voted down in anger a\r\nproposal to praise the administration of the Democratic President,\r\nCleveland. When the platform with its radical planks, including free\r\nsilver, was reported, a veritable storm broke. Senator Hill, trembling\r\nwith emotion, protested against the departure from old tests of\r\nDemocratic allegiance; against principles that must drive out of the\r\nparty men who had grown gray in its service; against revolutionary,\r\nunwise, and unprecedented steps in the history of the party. Senator\r\nVilas of Wisconsin, in great fervor, avowed that there was no difference\r\nin principle between the free coinage of silver--\"the confiscation of\r\none-half of the credits of the nation for the benefit of debtors\"--and\r\ncommunism itself--\"a universal distribution of property.\" In the triumph\r\nof that cause he saw the beginning of \"the overthrow of all law, all\r\njustice, all security and repose in the social order.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nWILLIAM J. BRYAN IN 1898]\r\n\r\n=The Crown of Thorns Speech.=--The champions of free silver replied in\r\nstrident tones. They accused the gold advocates of being the aggressors\r\nwho had assailed the labor and the homes of the people. William Jennings\r\nBryan, of Nebraska, voiced their sentiments in a memorable oration. He\r\ndeclared that their cause \"was as holy as the cause of liberty--the\r\ncause of humanity.\" He exclaimed that the contest was between the idle\r\nholders of idle capital and the toiling millions. Then he named those\r\nfor whom he spoke--the wage-earner, the country lawyer, the small\r\nmerchant, the farmer, and the miner. \"The man who is employed for wages\r\nis as much a business man as his employer. The attorney in a country\r\ntown is as much a business man as the corporation counsel in a great\r\nmetropolis. The merchant at the cross roads store is as much a business\r\nman as the merchant of New York. The farmer ... is as much a business\r\nman as the man who goes upon the board of trade and bets upon the price\r\nof grain. The miners who go a thousand feet into the earth or climb two\r\nthousand feet upon the cliffs ... are as much business men as the few\r\nfinancial magnates who in a back room corner the money of the world....\r\nIt is for these that we speak. We do not come as aggressors. Ours is not\r\na war of conquest. We are fighting in defense of our homes, our\r\nfamilies, and our posterity. We have petitioned and our petitions have\r\nbeen scorned. We have entreated and our entreaties have been\r\ndisregarded. We have begged and they have mocked when our calamity came.\r\nWe beg no longer; we entreat no more; we petition no more. We defy\r\nthem.... We shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to\r\nthem, 'You shall not press upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns.\r\nYou shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.'\"\r\n\r\n=Bryan Nominated.=--In all the history of national conventions never had\r\nan orator so completely swayed a multitude; not even Yancey in his\r\nmemorable plea in the Charleston convention of 1860 when, with grave and\r\nmoving eloquence, he espoused the Southern cause against the impending\r\nfates. The delegates, after cheering Mr. Bryan until they could cheer no\r\nmore, tore the standards from the floor and gathered around the Nebraska\r\ndelegation to renew the deafening applause. The platform as reported was\r\ncarried by a vote of two to one and the young orator from the West,\r\nhailed as America's Tiberius Gracchus, was nominated as the Democratic\r\ncandidate for President. The South and West had triumphed over the East.\r\nThe division was sectional, admittedly sectional--the old combination of\r\npower which Calhoun had so anxiously labored to build up a century\r\nearlier. The Gold Democrats were repudiated in terms which were clear to\r\nall. A few, unable to endure the thought of voting the Republican\r\nticket, held a convention at Indianapolis where, with the sanction of\r\nCleveland, they nominated candidates of their own and endorsed the gold\r\nstandard in a forlorn hope.\r\n\r\n=The Democratic Platform.=--It was to the call from Chicago that the\r\nDemocrats gave heed and the Republicans made answer. The platform on\r\nwhich Mr. Bryan stood, unlike most party manifestoes, was explicit in\r\nits language and its appeal. It denounced the practice of allowing\r\nnational banks to issue notes intended to circulate as money on the\r\nground that it was \"in derogation of the Constitution,\" recalling\r\nJackson's famous attack on the Bank in 1832. It declared that tariff\r\nduties should be laid \"for the purpose of revenue\"--Calhoun's doctrine.\r\nIn demanding the free coinage of silver, it recurred to the practice\r\nabandoned in 1873. The income tax came next on the program. The platform\r\nalleged that the law of 1894, passed by a Democratic Congress, was \"in\r\nstrict pursuance of the uniform decisions of the Supreme Court for\r\nnearly a hundred years,\" and then hinted that the decision annulling the\r\nlaw might be reversed by the same body \"as it may hereafter be\r\nconstituted.\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal to labor voiced by Mr. Bryan in his \"crown of thorns\" speech\r\nwas reinforced in the platform. \"As labor creates the wealth of the\r\ncountry,\" ran one plank, \"we demand the passage of such laws as may be\r\nnecessary to protect it in all its rights.\" Referring to the recent\r\nPullman strike, the passions of which had not yet died away, the\r\nplatform denounced \"arbitrary interference by federal authorities in\r\nlocal affairs as a violation of the Constitution of the United States\r\nand a crime against free institutions.\" A special objection was lodged\r\nagainst \"government by injunction as a new and highly dangerous form of\r\noppression by which federal judges, in contempt of the laws of states\r\nand rights of citizens, become at once legislators, judges, and\r\nexecutioners.\" The remedy advanced was a federal law assuring trial by\r\njury in all cases of contempt in labor disputes. Having made this\r\ndeclaration of faith, the Democrats, with Mr. Bryan at the head, raised\r\ntheir standard of battle.\r\n\r\n=The Heated Campaign.=--The campaign which ensued outrivaled in the\r\nrange of its educational activities and the bitterness of its tone all\r\nother political conflicts in American history, not excepting the fateful\r\nstruggle of 1860. Immense sums of money were contributed to the funds of\r\nboth parties. Railway, banking, and other corporations gave generously\r\nto the Republicans; the silver miners, less lavishly but with the same\r\nanxiety, supported the Democrats. The country was flooded with\r\npamphlets, posters, and handbills. Every public forum, from the great\r\nauditoriums of the cities to the \"red schoolhouses\" on the countryside,\r\nwas occupied by the opposing forces.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan took the stump himself, visiting all parts of the country in\r\nspecial trains and addressing literally millions of people in the open\r\nair. Mr. McKinley chose the older and more formal plan. He received\r\ndelegations at his home in Canton and discussed the issues of the\r\ncampaign from his front porch, leaving to an army of well-organized\r\norators the task of reaching the people in their home towns. Parades,\r\nprocessions, and monster demonstrations filled the land with politics.\r\nWhole states were polled in advance by the Republicans and the doubtful\r\nvoters personally visited by men equipped with arguments and literature.\r\nManufacturers, frightened at the possibility of disordered public\r\ncredit, announced that they would close their doors if the Democrats won\r\nthe election. Men were dismissed from public and private places on\r\naccount of their political views, one eminent college president being\r\nforced out for advocating free silver. The language employed by\r\nimpassioned and embittered speakers on both sides roused the public to a\r\nstate of frenzy, once more showing the lengths to which men could go in\r\npersonal and political abuse.\r\n\r\n=The Republican Victory.=--The verdict of the nation was decisive.\r\nMcKinley received 271 of the 447 electoral votes, and 7,111,000 popular\r\nvotes as against Bryan's 6,509,000. The congressional elections were\r\nequally positive although, on account of the composition of the Senate,\r\nthe \"hold-over\" Democrats and Populists still enjoyed a power out of\r\nproportion to their strength as measured at the polls. Even as it was,\r\nthe Republicans got full control of both houses--a dominion of the\r\nentire government which they were to hold for fourteen years--until the\r\nsecond half of Mr. Taft's administration, when they lost possession of\r\nthe House of Representatives. The yoke of indecision was broken. The\r\nparty of sound finance and protective tariffs set out upon its lease of\r\npower with untroubled assurance.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPUBLICAN MEASURES AND RESULTS\r\n\r\n=The Gold Standard and the Tariff.=--Yet strange as it may seem, the\r\nRepublicans did not at once enact legislation making the gold dollar the\r\nstandard for the national currency. Not until 1900 did they take that\r\npositive step. In his first inaugural President McKinley, as if still\r\nuncertain in his own mind or fearing a revival of the contest just\r\nclosed, placed the tariff, not the money question, in the forefront.\r\n\"The people have decided,\" he said, \"that such legislation should be had\r\nas will give ample protection and encouragement to the industries and\r\ndevelopment of our country.\" Protection for American industries,\r\ntherefore, he urged, is the task before Congress. \"With adequate revenue\r\nsecured, but not until then, we can enter upon changes in our fiscal\r\nlaws.\" As the Republicans had only forty-six of the ninety Senators, and\r\nat least four of them were known advocates of free silver, the\r\ndiscretion exercised by the President in selecting the tariff for\r\ncongressional debate was the better part of valor.\r\n\r\nCongress gave heed to the warning. Under the direction of Nelson P.\r\nDingley, whose name was given to the bill, a tariff measure levying the\r\nhighest rates yet laid in the history of American imposts was prepared\r\nand driven through the House of Representatives. The opposition\r\nencountered in the Senate, especially from the West, was overcome by\r\nconcessions in favor of that section; but the duties on sugar, tin,\r\nsteel, lumber, hemp, and in fact all of the essential commodities\r\nhandled by combinations and trusts, were materially raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT MCKINLEY AND HIS CABINET]\r\n\r\n=Growth of Combinations.=--The years that followed the enactment of the\r\nDingley law were, whatever the cause, the most prosperous the country\r\nhad witnessed for many a decade. Industries of every kind were soon\r\nrunning full blast; labor was employed; commerce spread more swiftly\r\nthan ever to the markets of the world. Coincident with this progress was\r\nthe organization of the greatest combinations and trusts the world had\r\nyet seen. In 1899 the smelters formed a trust with a capital of\r\n$65,000,000; in the same year the Standard Oil Company with a capital of\r\nover one hundred millions took the place of the old trust; and the\r\nCopper Trust was incorporated under the laws of New Jersey, its par\r\nvalue capital being fixed shortly afterward at $175,000,000. A year\r\nlater the National Sugar Refining Company, of New Jersey, started with a\r\ncapital of $90,000,000, adopting the policy of issuing to the\r\nstockholders no public statement of its earnings or financial condition.\r\nBefore another twelvemonth had elapsed all previous corporate financing\r\nwas reduced to small proportions by the flotation of the United States\r\nSteel Corporation with a capital of more than a billion dollars, an\r\nenterprise set in motion by the famous Morgan banking house of New York.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all these gigantic undertakings, the same great leaders in\r\nfinance were more or less intimately associated. To use the language of\r\nan eminent authority: \"They are all allied and intertwined by their\r\nvarious mutual interests. For instance, the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\ninterests are on the one hand allied with the Vanderbilts and on the\r\nother with the Rockefellers. The Vanderbilts are closely allied with the\r\nMorgan group.... Viewed as a whole we find the dominating influences in\r\nthe trusts to be made up of a network of large and small capitalists,\r\nmany allied to one another by ties of more or less importance, but all\r\nbeing appendages to or parts of the greater groups which are themselves\r\ndependent on and allied with the two mammoth or Rockefeller and Morgan\r\ngroups. These two mammoth groups jointly ... constitute the heart of the\r\nbusiness and commercial life of the nation.\" Such was the picture of\r\ntriumphant business enterprise drawn by a financier within a few years\r\nafter the memorable campaign of 1896.\r\n\r\nAmerica had become one of the first workshops of the world. It was, by\r\nvirtue of the closely knit organization of its business and finance, one\r\nof the most powerful and energetic leaders in the struggle of the giants\r\nfor the business of the earth. The capital of the Steel Corporation\r\nalone was more than ten times the total national debt which the apostles\r\nof calamity in the days of Washington and Hamilton declared the nation\r\ncould never pay. American industry, filling domestic markets to\r\noverflowing, was ready for new worlds to conquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nF.W. Taussig, _Tariff History of the United States_.\r\n\r\nJ.L.

Perhaps at this late day, it is useless to\r\nprotest against the currency of the idea. Nevertheless, the truth is\r\nthat from the fateful moment in March, 1775, when Edmund Burke unfolded\r\nto his colleagues in the British Parliament the resources of an\r\ninvincible America, down to the settlement at Versailles in 1919 closing\r\nthe drama of the World War, this nation has been a world power,\r\ninfluencing by its example, by its institutions, by its wealth, trade,\r\nand arms the course of international affairs. And it should be said also\r\nthat neither in the field of commercial enterprise nor in that of\r\ndiplomacy has it been wanting in spirit or ingenuity.\r\n\r\nWhen John Hay, Secretary of State, heard that an American citizen,\r\nPerdicaris, had been seized by Raisuli, a Moroccan bandit, in 1904, he\r\nwired his brusque message: \"We want Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead.\"\r\nThis was but an echo of Commodore Decatur's equally characteristic\r\nanswer, \"Not a minute,\" given nearly a hundred years before to the\r\npirates of Algiers begging for time to consider whether they would cease\r\npreying upon American merchantmen. Was it not as early as 1844 that the\r\nAmerican commissioner, Caleb Cushing, taking advantage of the British\r\nOpium War on China, negotiated with the Celestial Empire a successful\r\ncommercial treaty? Did he not then exultantly exclaim: \"The laws of the\r\nUnion follow its citizens and its banner protects them even within the\r\ndomain of the Chinese Empire\"? Was it not almost half a century before\r\nthe battle of Manila Bay in 1898, that Commodore Perry with an adequate\r\nnaval force \"gently coerced Japan into friendship with us,\" leading all\r\nthe nations of the earth in the opening of that empire to the trade of\r\nthe Occident? Nor is it inappropriate in this connection to recall the\r\nfact that the Monroe Doctrine celebrates in 1923 its hundredth\r\nanniversary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FOREIGN RELATIONS (1865-98)\r\n\r\n=French Intrigues in Mexico Blocked.=--Between the war for the union and\r\nthe war with Spain, the Department of State had many an occasion to\r\npresent the rights of America among the powers of the world. Only a\r\nlittle while after the civil conflict came to a close, it was called\r\nupon to deal with a dangerous situation created in Mexico by the\r\nambitions of Napoleon III. During the administration of Buchanan, Mexico\r\nhad fallen into disorder through the strife of the Liberal and the\r\nClerical parties; the President asked for authority to use American\r\ntroops to bring to a peaceful haven \"a wreck upon the ocean, drifting\r\nabout as she is impelled by different factions.\" Our own domestic crisis\r\nthen intervened.\r\n\r\nObserving the United States heavily involved in its own problems, the\r\ngreat powers, England, France, and Spain, decided in the autumn of 1861\r\nto take a hand themselves in restoring order in Mexico. They entered\r\ninto an agreement to enforce the claims of their citizens against Mexico\r\nand to protect their subjects residing in that republic. They invited\r\nthe United States to join them, and, on meeting a polite refusal, they\r\nprepared for a combined military and naval demonstration on their own\r\naccount. In the midst of this action England and Spain, discovering the\r\nsinister purposes of Napoleon, withdrew their troops and left the field\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nThe French Emperor, it was well known, looked with jealousy upon the\r\ngrowth of the United States and dreamed of establishing in the Western\r\nhemisphere an imperial power to offset the American republic.\r\nIntervention to collect debts was only a cloak for his deeper designs.\r\nThrowing off that guise in due time, he made the Archduke Maximilian, a\r\nbrother of the ruler of Austria, emperor in Mexico, and surrounded his\r\nthrone by French soldiers, in spite of all protests.\r\n\r\nThis insolent attack upon the Mexican republic, deeply resented in the\r\nUnited States, was allowed to drift in its course until 1865. At that\r\njuncture General Sheridan was dispatched to the Mexican border with a\r\nlarge armed force; General Grant urged the use of the American army to\r\nexpel the French from this continent. The Secretary of State, Seward,\r\ncounseled negotiation first, and, applying the Monroe Doctrine, was able\r\nto prevail upon Napoleon III to withdraw his troops. Without the support\r\nof French arms, the sham empire in Mexico collapsed like a house of\r\ncards and the unhappy Maximilian, the victim of French ambition and\r\nintrigue, met his death at the hands of a Mexican firing squad.\r\n\r\n=Alaska Purchased.=--The Mexican affair had not been brought to a close\r\nbefore the Department of State was busy with negotiations which resulted\r\nin the purchase of Alaska from Russia. The treaty of cession, signed on\r\nMarch 30, 1867, added to the United States a domain of nearly six\r\nhundred thousand square miles, a territory larger than Texas and nearly\r\nthree-fourths the size of the Louisiana purchase. Though it was a\r\ndistant colony separated from our continental domain by a thousand miles\r\nof water, no question of \"imperialism\" or \"colonization foreign to\r\nAmerican doctrines\" seems to have been raised at the time. The treaty\r\nwas ratified promptly by the Senate. The purchase price, $7,200,000, was\r\nvoted by the House of Representatives after the display of some\r\nresentment against a system that compelled it to appropriate money to\r\nfulfill an obligation which it had no part in making. Seward, who\r\nformulated the treaty, rejoiced, as he afterwards said, that he had kept\r\nAlaska out of the hands of England.\r\n\r\n=American Interest in the Caribbean.=--Having achieved this diplomatic\r\ntriumph, Seward turned to the increase of American power in another\r\ndirection. He negotiated, with Denmark, a treaty providing for the\r\npurchase of the islands of St. John and St. Thomas in the West Indies,\r\nstrategic points in the Caribbean for sea power. This project, long\r\nafterward brought to fruition by other men, was defeated on this\r\noccasion by the refusal of the Senate to ratify the treaty. Evidently it\r\nwas not yet prepared to exercise colonial dominion over other races.\r\n\r\nUndaunted by the misadventure in Caribbean policies, President Grant\r\nwarmly advocated the acquisition of Santo Domingo. This little republic\r\nhad long been in a state of general disorder. In 1869 a treaty of\r\nannexation was concluded with its president. The document Grant\r\ntransmitted to the Senate with his cordial approval, only to have it\r\nrejected. Not at all changed in his opinion by the outcome of his\r\neffort, he continued to urge the subject of annexation. Even in his last\r\nmessage to Congress he referred to it, saying that time had only proved\r\nthe wisdom of his early course. The addition of Santo Domingo to the\r\nAmerican sphere of protection was the work of a later generation. The\r\nState Department, temporarily checked, had to bide its time.\r\n\r\n=The _Alabama_ Claims Arbitrated.=--Indeed, it had in hand a far more\r\nserious matter, a vexing issue that grew out of Civil War diplomacy. The\r\nBritish government, as already pointed out in other connections, had\r\npermitted Confederate cruisers, including the famous _Alabama_, built in\r\nBritish ports, to escape and prey upon the commerce of the Northern\r\nstates. This action, denounced at the time by our government as a grave\r\nbreach of neutrality as well as a grievous injury to American citizens,\r\nled first to remonstrances and finally to repeated claims for damages\r\ndone to American ships and goods. For a long time Great Britain was\r\nfirm. Her foreign secretary denied all obligations in the premises,\r\nadding somewhat curtly that \"he wished to say once for all that Her\r\nMajesty's government disclaimed any responsibility for the losses and\r\nhoped that they had made their position perfectly clear.\" Still\r\nPresident Grant was not persuaded that the door of diplomacy, though\r\nclosed, was barred. Hamilton Fish, his Secretary of State, renewed the\r\ndemand. Finally he secured from the British government in 1871 the\r\ntreaty of Washington providing for the arbitration not merely of the\r\n_Alabama_ and other claims but also all points of serious controversy\r\nbetween the two countries.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal of arbitration thus authorized sat at Geneva in\r\nSwitzerland, and after a long and careful review of the arguments on\r\nboth sides awarded to the United States the lump sum of $15,500,000 to\r\nbe distributed among the American claimants. The damages thus allowed\r\nwere large, unquestionably larger than strict justice required and it is\r\nnot surprising that the decision excited much adverse comment in\r\nEngland. Nevertheless, the prompt payment by the British government\r\nswept away at once a great cloud of ill-feeling in America. Moreover,\r\nthe spectacle of two powerful nations choosing the way of peaceful\r\narbitration to settle an angry dispute seemed a happy, if illusory, omen\r\nof a modern method for avoiding the arbitrament of war.\r\n\r\n=Samoa.=--If the Senate had its doubts at first about the wisdom of\r\nacquiring strategic points for naval power in distant seas, the same\r\ncould not be said of the State Department or naval officers. In 1872\r\nCommander Meade, of the United States navy, alive to the importance of\r\ncoaling stations even in mid-ocean, made a commercial agreement with the\r\nchief of Tutuila, one of the Samoan Islands, far below the equator, in\r\nthe southern Pacific, nearer to Australia than to California. This\r\nagreement, providing among other things for our use of the harbor of\r\nPago Pago as a naval base, was six years later changed into a formal\r\ntreaty ratified by the Senate.\r\n\r\nSuch enterprise could not escape the vigilant eyes of England and\r\nGermany, both mindful of the course of the sea power in history. The\r\nGerman emperor, seizing as a pretext a quarrel between his consul in the\r\nislands and a native king, laid claim to an interest in the Samoan\r\ngroup. England, aware of the dangers arising from German outposts in the\r\nsouthern seas so near to Australia, was not content to stand aside. So\r\nit happened that all three countries sent battleships to the Samoan\r\nwaters, threatening a crisis that was fortunately averted by friendly\r\nsettlement. If, as is alleged, Germany entertained a notion of\r\nchallenging American sea power then and there, the presence of British\r\nships must have dispelled that dream.\r\n\r\nThe result of the affair was a tripartite agreement by which the three\r\npowers in 1889 undertook a protectorate over the islands. But joint\r\ncontrol proved unsatisfactory. There was constant friction between the\r\nGermans and the English. The spheres of authority being vague and open\r\nto dispute, the plan had to be abandoned at the end of ten years.\r\nEngland withdrew altogether, leaving to Germany all the islands except\r\nTutuila, which was ceded outright to the United States. Thus one of the\r\nfinest harbors in the Pacific, to the intense delight of the American\r\nnavy, passed permanently under American dominion. Another triumph in\r\ndiplomacy was set down to the credit of the State Department.\r\n\r\n=Cleveland and the Venezuela Affair.=--In the relations with South\r\nAmerica, as well as in those with the distant Pacific, the diplomacy of\r\nthe government at Washington was put to the test. For some time it had\r\nbeen watching a dispute between England and Venezuela over the western\r\nboundary of British Guiana and, on an appeal from Venezuela, it had\r\ntaken a lively interest in the contest. In 1895 President Cleveland saw\r\nthat Great Britain would yield none of her claims. After hearing the\r\narguments of Venezuela, his Secretary of State, Richard T. Olney, in a\r\nnote none too conciliatory, asked the British government whether it was\r\nwilling to arbitrate the points in controversy. This inquiry he\r\naccompanied by a warning to the effect that the United States could not\r\npermit any European power to contest its mastery in this hemisphere.\r\n\"The United States,\" said the Secretary, \"is practically sovereign on\r\nthis continent and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it\r\nconfines its interposition.... Its infinite resources, combined with its\r\nisolated position, render it master of the situation and practically\r\ninvulnerable against any or all other powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply evoked from the British government by this strong statement\r\nwas firm and clear. The Monroe Doctrine, it said, even if not so widely\r\nstretched by interpretation, was not binding in international law; the\r\ndispute with Venezuela was a matter of interest merely to the parties\r\ninvolved; and arbitration of the question was impossible. This response\r\ncalled forth President Cleveland's startling message of 1895. He asked\r\nCongress to create a commission authorized to ascertain by researches\r\nthe true boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana. He added that it\r\nwould be the duty of this country \"to resist by every means in its\r\npower, as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests, the\r\nappropriation by Great Britain of any lands or the exercise of\r\ngovernmental jurisdiction over any territory which, after investigation,\r\nwe have determined of right belongs to Venezuela.\" The serious character\r\nof this statement he thoroughly understood. He declared that he was\r\nconscious of his responsibilities, intimating that war, much as it was\r\nto be deplored, was not comparable to \"a supine submission to wrong and\r\ninjustice and the consequent loss of national self-respect and honor.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROVER CLEVELAND]\r\n\r\nThe note of defiance which ran through this message, greeted by shrill\r\ncries of enthusiasm in many circles, was viewed in other quarters as a\r\nportent of war. Responsible newspapers in both countries spoke of an\r\narmed settlement of the dispute as inevitable. Congress created the\r\ncommission and appropriated money for the investigation; a body of\r\nlearned men was appointed to determine the merits of the conflicting\r\nboundary claims. The British government, deaf to the clamor of the\r\nbellicose section of the London press, deplored the incident,\r\ncourteously replied in the affirmative to a request for assistance in\r\nthe search for evidence, and finally agreed to the proposition that the\r\nissue be submitted to arbitration. The outcome of this somewhat perilous\r\ndispute contributed not a little to Cleveland's reputation as \"a\r\nsterling representative of the true American spirit.\" This was not\r\ndiminished when the tribunal of arbitration found that Great Britain was\r\non the whole right in her territorial claims against Venezuela.\r\n\r\n=The Annexation of Hawaii.=--While engaged in the dangerous Venezuela\r\ncontroversy, President Cleveland was compelled by a strange turn in\r\nevents to consider the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands in the\r\nmid-Pacific. For more than half a century American missionaries had been\r\nactive in converting the natives to the Christian faith and enterprising\r\nAmerican business men had been developing the fertile sugar plantations.\r\nBoth the Department of State and the Navy Department were fully\r\nconscious of the strategic relation of the islands to the growth of sea\r\npower and watched with anxiety any developments likely to bring them\r\nunder some other Dominion.\r\n\r\nThe country at large was indifferent, however, until 1893, when a\r\nrevolution, headed by Americans, broke out, ending in the overthrow of\r\nthe native government, the abolition of the primitive monarchy, and the\r\nretirement of Queen Liliuokalani to private life. This crisis, a\r\nrepetition of the Texas affair in a small theater, was immediately\r\nfollowed by a demand from the new Hawaiian government for annexation to\r\nthe United States. President Harrison looked with favor on the proposal,\r\nnegotiated the treaty of annexation, and laid it before the Senate for\r\napproval. There it still rested when his term of office was brought to a\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nHarrison's successor, Cleveland, it was well known, had doubts about the\r\npropriety of American action in Hawaii. For the purpose of making an\r\ninquiry into the matter, he sent a special commissioner to the islands.\r\nOn the basis of the report of his agent, Cleveland came to the\r\nconclusion that \"the revolution in the island kingdom had been\r\naccomplished by the improper use of the armed forces of the United\r\nStates and that the wrong should be righted by a restoration of the\r\nqueen to her throne.\" Such being his matured conviction, though the\r\nfacts upon which he rested it were warmly controverted, he could do\r\nnothing but withdraw the treaty from the Senate and close the incident.\r\n\r\nTo the Republicans this sharp and cavalier disposal of their plans,\r\ncarried out in a way that impugned the motives of a Republican\r\nPresident, was nothing less than \"a betrayal of American interests.\" In\r\ntheir platform of 1896 they made clear their position: \"Our foreign\r\npolicy should be at all times firm, vigorous, and dignified and all our\r\ninterests in the Western hemisphere carefully watched and guarded. The\r\nHawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States and no\r\nforeign power should be permitted to interfere with them.\" There was no\r\nmistaking this view of the issue. As the vote in the election gave\r\npopular sanction to Republican policies, Congress by a joint resolution,\r\npassed on July 6, 1898, annexed the islands to the United States and\r\nlater conferred upon them the ordinary territorial form of government.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUBA AND THE SPANISH WAR\r\n\r\n=Early American Relations with Cuba.=--The year that brought Hawaii\r\nfinally under the American flag likewise drew to a conclusion another\r\nlong controversy over a similar outpost in the Atlantic, one of the last\r\nremnants of the once glorious Spanish empire--the island of Cuba.\r\n\r\nFor a century the Department of State had kept an anxious eye upon this\r\nbase of power, knowing full well that both France and England, already\r\nwell established in the West Indies, had their attention also fixed upon\r\nCuba. In the administration of President Fillmore they had united in\r\nproposing to the United States a tripartite treaty guaranteeing Spain in\r\nher none too certain ownership. This proposal, squarely rejected,\r\nfurnished the occasion for a statement of American policy which stood\r\nthe test of all the years that followed; namely, that the affair was one\r\nbetween Spain and the United States alone.\r\n\r\nIn that long contest in the United States for the balance of power\r\nbetween the North and South, leaders in the latter section often thought\r\nof bringing Cuba into the union to offset the free states. An\r\nopportunity to announce their purposes publicly was afforded in 1854 by\r\na controversy over the seizure of an American ship by Cuban authorities.\r\nOn that occasion three American ministers abroad, stationed at Madrid,\r\nParis, and London respectively, held a conference and issued the\r\ncelebrated \"Ostend Manifesto.\" They united in declaring that Cuba, by\r\nher geographical position, formed a part of the United States, that\r\npossession by a foreign power was inimical to American interests, and\r\nthat an effort should be made to purchase the island from Spain. In case\r\nthe owner refused to sell, they concluded, with a menacing flourish, \"by\r\nevery law, human and divine, we shall be justified in wresting it from\r\nSpain if we possess the power.\" This startling proclamation to the world\r\nwas promptly disowned by the United States government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _=An old cartoon.=_\r\n\r\nA SIGHT TOO BAD\r\n\r\n_Struggling Cuba._ \"You must be awfully near-sighted, Mr. President, not\r\nto recognize me.\" _U.S.G._ \"No, I am far-sighted: for I can recognize\r\nFrance.\"]\r\n\r\n=Revolutions in Cuba.=--For nearly twenty years afterwards the Cuban\r\nquestion rested. Then it was revived in another form during President\r\nGrant's administrations, when the natives became engaged in a\r\ndestructive revolt against Spanish officials. For ten years--1868-78--a\r\nguerrilla warfare raged in the island. American citizens, by virtue of\r\ntheir ancient traditions of democracy, naturally sympathized with a war\r\nfor independence and self-government. Expeditions to help the insurgents\r\nwere fitted out secretly in American ports. Arms and supplies were\r\nsmuggled into Cuba. American soldiers of fortune joined their ranks. The\r\nenforcement of neutrality against the friends of Cuban independence, no\r\npleasing task for a sympathetic President, the protection of American\r\nlives and property in the revolutionary area, and similar matters kept\r\nour government busy with Cuba for a whole decade.\r\n\r\nA brief lull in Cuban disorders was followed in 1895 by a renewal of the\r\nrevolutionary movement. The contest between the rebels and the Spanish\r\ntroops, marked by extreme cruelty and a total disregard for life and\r\nproperty, exceeded all bounds of decency, and once more raised the old\r\nquestions that had tormented Grant's administration. Gomez, the leader\r\nof the revolt, intent upon provoking American interference, laid waste\r\nthe land with fire and sword. By a proclamation of November 6, 1895, he\r\nordered the destruction of sugar plantations and railway connections and\r\nthe closure of all sugar factories. The work of ruin was completed by\r\nthe ruthless Spanish general, Weyler, who concentrated the inhabitants\r\nfrom rural regions into military camps, where they died by the hundreds\r\nof disease and starvation. Stories of the atrocities, bad enough in\r\nsimple form, became lurid when transmuted into American news and deeply\r\nmoved the sympathies of the American people. Sermons were preached about\r\nSpanish misdeeds; orators demanded that the Cubans be sustained \"in\r\ntheir heroic struggle for independence\"; newspapers, scouting the\r\nordinary forms of diplomatic negotiation, spurned mediation and demanded\r\nintervention and war if necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nCUBAN REVOLUTIONISTS]\r\n\r\n=President Cleveland's Policy.=--Cleveland chose the way of peace. He\r\nordered the observance of the rule of neutrality. He declined to act on\r\na resolution of Congress in favor of giving to the Cubans the rights of\r\nbelligerents. Anxious to bring order to the distracted island, he\r\ntendered to Spain the good offices of the United States as mediator in\r\nthe contest--a tender rejected by the Spanish government with the broad\r\nhint that President Cleveland might be more vigorous in putting a stop\r\nto the unlawful aid in money, arms, and supplies, afforded to the\r\ninsurgents by American sympathizers. Thereupon the President returned to\r\nthe course he had marked out for himself, leaving \"the public nuisance\"\r\nto his successor, President McKinley.\r\n\r\n=Republican Policies.=--The Republicans in 1897 found themselves in a\r\nposition to employ that \"firm, vigorous, and dignified\" foreign policy\r\nwhich they had approved in their platform. They had declared: \"The\r\ngovernment of Spain having lost control of Cuba and being unable to\r\nprotect the property or lives of resident American citizens or to comply\r\nwith its treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the\r\nUnited States should actively use its influence and good offices to\r\nrestore peace and give independence to the island.\" The American\r\nproperty in Cuba to which the Republicans referred in their platform\r\namounted by this time to more than fifty million dollars; the commerce\r\nwith the island reached more than one hundred millions annually; and the\r\nclaims of American citizens against Spain for property destroyed totaled\r\nsixteen millions. To the pleas of humanity which made such an effective\r\nappeal to the hearts of the American people, there were thus added\r\npractical considerations of great weight.\r\n\r\n=President McKinley Negotiates.=--In the face of the swelling tide of\r\npopular opinion in favor of quick, drastic, and positive action,\r\nMcKinley chose first the way of diplomacy. A short time after his\r\ninauguration he lodged with the Spanish government a dignified protest\r\nagainst its policies in Cuba, thus opening a game of thrust and parry\r\nwith the suave ministers at Madrid. The results of the exchange of\r\nnotes were the recall of the obnoxious General Weyler, the appointment\r\nof a governor-general less bloodthirsty in his methods, a change in the\r\npolicy of concentrating civilians in military camps, and finally a\r\npromise of \"home rule\" for Cuba. There is no doubt that the Spanish\r\ngovernment was eager to avoid a war that could have but one outcome. The\r\nAmerican minister at Madrid, General Woodford, was convinced that firm\r\nand patient pressure would have resulted in the final surrender of Cuba\r\nby the Spanish government.\r\n\r\n=The De Lome and the _Maine_ Incidents.=--Such a policy was defeated by\r\nevents. In February, 1898, a private letter written by Señor de Lome,\r\nthe Spanish ambassador at Washington, expressing contempt for the\r\nPresident of the United States, was filched from the mails and passed\r\ninto the hands of a journalist, William R. Hearst, who published it to\r\nthe world. In the excited state of American opinion, few gave heed to\r\nthe grave breach of diplomatic courtesy committed by breaking open\r\nprivate correspondence. The Spanish government was compelled to recall\r\nDe Lome, thus officially condemning his conduct.\r\n\r\nAt this point a far more serious crisis put the pacific relations of the\r\ntwo negotiating countries in dire peril. On February 15, the battleship\r\n_Maine_, riding in the harbor of Havana, was blown up and sunk, carrying\r\nto death two officers and two hundred and fifty-eight members of the\r\ncrew. This tragedy, ascribed by the American public to the malevolence\r\nof Spanish officials, profoundly stirred an already furious nation.\r\nWhen, on March 21, a commission of inquiry reported that the ill-fated\r\nship had been blown up by a submarine mine which had in turn set off\r\nsome of the ship's magazines, the worst suspicions seemed confirmed. If\r\nany one was inclined to be indifferent to the Cuban war for\r\nindependence, he was now met by the vehement cry: \"Remember the\r\n_Maine_!\"\r\n\r\n=Spanish Concessions.=--Still the State Department, under McKinley's\r\nsteady hand, pursued the path of negotiation, Spain proving more pliable\r\nand more ready with promises of reform in the island. Early in April,\r\nhowever, there came a decided change in the tenor of American diplomacy.\r\nOn the 4th, McKinley, evidently convinced that promises did not mean\r\nperformances, instructed our minister at Madrid to warn the Spanish\r\ngovernment that as no effective armistice had been offered to the\r\nCubans, he would lay the whole matter before Congress. This decision,\r\nevery one knew, from the temper of Congress, meant war--a prospect which\r\nexcited all the European powers. The Pope took an active interest in the\r\ncrisis. France and Germany, foreseeing from long experience in world\r\npolitics an increase of American power and prestige through war, sought\r\nto prevent it. Spain, hopeless and conscious of her weakness, at last\r\ndispatched to the President a note promising to suspend hostilities, to\r\ncall a Cuban parliament, and to grant all the autonomy that could be\r\nreasonably asked.\r\n\r\n=President McKinley Calls for War.=--For reasons of his own--reasons\r\nwhich have never yet been fully explained--McKinley ignored the final\r\nprogram of concessions presented by Spain. At the very moment when his\r\npatient negotiations seemed to bear full fruit, he veered sharply from\r\nhis course and launched the country into the war by sending to Congress\r\nhis militant message of April 11, 1898. Without making public the last\r\nnote he had received from Spain, he declared that he was brought to the\r\nend of his effort and the cause was in the hands of Congress. Humanity,\r\nthe protection of American citizens and property, the injuries to\r\nAmerican commerce and business, the inability of Spain to bring about\r\npermanent peace in the island--these were the grounds for action that\r\ninduced him to ask for authority to employ military and naval forces in\r\nestablishing a stable government in Cuba. They were sufficient for a\r\npublic already straining at the leash.\r\n\r\n=The Resolution of Congress.=--There was no doubt of the outcome when\r\nthe issue was withdrawn from diplomacy and placed in charge of Congress.\r\nResolutions were soon introduced into the House of Representatives\r\nauthorizing the President to employ armed force in securing peace and\r\norder in the island and \"establishing by the free action of the people\r\nthereof a stable and independent government of their own.\" To the form\r\nand spirit of this proposal the Democrats and Populists took exception.\r\nIn the Senate, where they were stronger, their position had to be\r\nreckoned with by the narrow Republican majority. As the resolution\r\nfinally read, the independence of Cuba was recognized; Spain was called\r\nupon to relinquish her authority and withdraw from the island; and the\r\nPresident was empowered to use force to the extent necessary to carry\r\nthe resolutions into effect. Furthermore the United States disclaimed\r\n\"any disposition or intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or\r\ncontrol over said island except for the pacification thereof.\" Final\r\naction was taken by Congress on April 19, 1898, and approved by the\r\nPresident on the following day.\r\n\r\n=War and Victory.=--Startling events then followed in swift succession.\r\nThe navy, as a result in no small measure of the alertness of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Department, was ready for the\r\ntrial by battle. On May 1, Commodore Dewey at Manila Bay shattered the\r\nSpanish fleet, marking the doom of Spanish dominion in the Philippines.\r\nOn July 3, the Spanish fleet under Admiral Cervera, in attempting to\r\nescape from Havana, was utterly destroyed by American forces under\r\nCommodore Schley. On July 17, Santiago, invested by American troops\r\nunder General Shafter and shelled by the American ships, gave up the\r\nstruggle. On July 25 General Miles landed in Porto Rico. On August 13,\r\nGeneral Merritt and Admiral Dewey carried Manila by storm. The war was\r\nover.\r\n\r\n=The Peace Protocol.=--Spain had already taken cognizance of stern\r\nfacts. As early as July 26, 1898, acting through the French ambassador,\r\nM. Cambon, the Madrid government approached President McKinley for a\r\nstatement of the terms on which hostilities could be brought to a close.\r\nAfter some skirmishing Spain yielded reluctantly to the ultimatum. On\r\nAugust 12, the preliminary peace protocol was signed, stipulating that\r\nCuba should be free, Porto Rico ceded to the United States, and Manila\r\noccupied by American troops pending the formal treaty of peace. On\r\nOctober 1, the commissioners of the two countries met at Paris to bring\r\nabout the final settlement.\r\n\r\n=Peace Negotiations.=--When the day for the first session of the\r\nconference arrived, the government at Washington apparently had not made\r\nup its mind on the final disposition of the Philippines. Perhaps, before\r\nthe battle of Manila Bay, not ten thousand people in the United States\r\nknew or cared where the Philippines were. Certainly there was in the\r\nautumn of 1898 no decided opinion as to what should be done with the\r\nfruits of Dewey's victory. President McKinley doubtless voiced the\r\nsentiment of the people when he stated to the peace commissioners on the\r\neve of their departure that there had originally been no thought of\r\nconquest in the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe march of events, he added, had imposed new duties on the country.\r\n\"Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines,\" he said, \"is the\r\ncommercial opportunity to which American statesmanship cannot be\r\nindifferent. It is just to use every legitimate means for the\r\nenlargement of American trade.\" On this ground he directed the\r\ncommissioners to accept not less than the cession of the island of\r\nLuzon, the chief of the Philippine group, with its harbor of Manila. It\r\nwas not until the latter part of October that he definitely instructed\r\nthem to demand the entire archipelago, on the theory that the occupation\r\nof Luzon alone could not be justified \"on political, commercial, or\r\nhumanitarian grounds.\" This departure from the letter of the peace\r\nprotocol was bitterly resented by the Spanish agents. It was with\r\nheaviness of heart that they surrendered the last sign of Spain's\r\nancient dominion in the far Pacific.\r\n\r\n=The Final Terms of Peace.=--The treaty of peace, as finally agreed\r\nupon, embraced the following terms: the independence of Cuba; the\r\ncession of Porto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States;\r\nthe settlement of claims filed by the citizens of both countries; the\r\npayment of twenty million dollars to Spain by the United States for the\r\nPhilippines; and the determination of the status of the inhabitants of\r\nthe ceded territories by Congress. The great decision had been made. Its\r\nissue was in the hands of the Senate where the Democrats and the\r\nPopulists held the balance of power under the requirement of the\r\ntwo-thirds vote for ratification.\r\n\r\n=The Contest in America over the Treaty of Peace.=--The publication of\r\nthe treaty committing the United States to the administration of distant\r\ncolonies directed the shifting tides of public opinion into two distinct\r\nchannels: support of the policy and opposition to it. The trend in\r\nRepublican leadership, long in the direction marked out by the treaty,\r\nnow came into the open. Perhaps a majority of the men highest in the\r\ncouncils of that party had undergone the change of heart reflected in\r\nthe letters of John Hay, Secretary of State. In August of 1898 he had\r\nhinted, in a friendly letter to Andrew Carnegie, that he sympathized\r\nwith the latter's opposition to \"imperialism\"; but he had added quickly:\r\n\"The only question in my mind is how far it is now possible for us to\r\nwithdraw from the Philippines.\" In November of the same year he wrote to\r\nWhitelaw Reid, one of the peace commissioners at Paris: \"There is a wild\r\nand frantic attack now going on in the press against the whole\r\nPhilippine transaction. Andrew Carnegie really seems to be off his\r\nhead.... But all this confusion of tongues will go its way. The country\r\nwill applaud the resolution that has been reached and you will return in\r\nthe rôle of conquering heroes with your 'brows bound with oak.'\"\r\n\r\nSenator Beveridge of Indiana and Senator Platt of Connecticut, accepting\r\nthe verdict of history as the proof of manifest destiny, called for\r\nunquestioning support of the administration in its final step. \"Every\r\nexpansion of our territory,\" said the latter, \"has been in accordance\r\nwith the irresistible law of growth. We could no more resist the\r\nsuccessive expansions by which we have grown to be the strongest nation\r\non earth than a tree can resist its growth. The history of territorial\r\nexpansion is the history of our nation's progress and glory. It is a\r\nmatter to be proud of, not to lament. We should rejoice that Providence\r\nhas given us the opportunity to extend our influence, our institutions,\r\nand our civilization into regions hitherto closed to us, rather than\r\ncontrive how we can thwart its designs.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine was savagely attacked by opponents of McKinley's policy,\r\nmany a stanch Republican joining with the majority of Democrats in\r\ndenouncing the treaty as a departure from the ideals of the republic.\r\nSenator Vest introduced in the Senate a resolution that \"under the\r\nConstitution of the United States, no power is given to the federal\r\nGovernment to acquire territory to be held and governed permanently as\r\ncolonies.\" Senator Hoar, of Massachusetts, whose long and honorable\r\ncareer gave weight to his lightest words, inveighed against the whole\r\nprocedure and to the end of his days believed that the new drift into\r\nrivalry with European nations as a colonial power was fraught with\r\ngenuine danger. \"Our imperialistic friends,\" he said, \"seem to have\r\nforgotten the use of the vocabulary of liberty. They talk about giving\r\ngood government. 'We shall give them such a government as we think they\r\nare fitted for.' 'We shall give them a better government than they had\r\nbefore.' Why, Mr. President, that one phrase conveys to a free man and a\r\nfree people the most stinging of insults. In that little phrase, as in a\r\nseed, is contained the germ of all despotism and of all tyranny.\r\nGovernment is not a gift. Free government is not to be given by all the\r\nblended powers of earth and heaven. It is a birthright. It belongs, as\r\nour fathers said, and as their children said, as Jefferson said, and as\r\nPresident McKinley said, to human nature itself.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate, more conservative on the question of annexation than the\r\nHouse of Representatives composed of men freshly elected in the stirring\r\ncampaign of 1896, was deliberate about ratification of the treaty. The\r\nDemocrats and Populists were especially recalcitrant. Mr. Bryan hurried\r\nto Washington and brought his personal influence to bear in favor of\r\nspeedy action. Patriotism required ratification, it was said in one\r\nquarter. The country desires peace and the Senate ought not to delay, it\r\nwas urged in another. Finally, on February 6, 1899, the requisite\r\nmajority of two-thirds was mustered, many a Senator who voted for the\r\ntreaty, however, sharing the misgivings of Senator Hoar as to the\r\n\"dangers of imperialism.\" Indeed at the time, the Senators passed a\r\nresolution declaring that the policy to be adopted in the Philippines\r\nwas still an open question, leaving to the future, in this way, the\r\npossibility of retracing their steps.\r\n\r\n=The Attitude of England.=--The Spanish war, while accomplishing the\r\nsimple objects of those who launched the nation on that course, like all\r\nother wars, produced results wholly unforeseen. In the first place, it\r\nexercised a profound influence on the drift of opinion among European\r\npowers. In England, sympathy with the United States was from the first\r\npositive and outspoken. \"The state of feeling here,\" wrote Mr. Hay, then\r\nambassador in London, \"is the best I have ever known. From every quarter\r\nthe evidences of it come to me. The royal family by habit and tradition\r\nare most careful not to break the rules of strict neutrality, but even\r\namong them I find nothing but hearty kindness and--so far as is\r\nconsistent with propriety--sympathy. Among the political leaders on both\r\nsides I find not only sympathy but a somewhat eager desire that 'the\r\nother fellows' shall not seem more friendly.\"\r\n\r\nJoseph Chamberlain, the distinguished Liberal statesman, thinking no\r\ndoubt of the continental situation, said in a political address at the\r\nvery opening of the war that the next duty of Englishmen \"is to\r\nestablish and maintain bonds of permanent unity with our kinsmen across\r\nthe Atlantic.... I even go so far as to say that, terrible as war may\r\nbe, even war would be cheaply purchased if, in a great and noble cause,\r\nthe Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack should wave together over an\r\nAnglo-Saxon alliance.\" To the American ambassador he added\r\nsignificantly that he did not \"care a hang what they say about it on the\r\ncontinent,\" which was another way of expressing the hope that the\r\nwarning to Germany and France was sufficient. This friendly English\r\nopinion, so useful to the United States when a combination of powers to\r\nsupport Spain was more than possible, removed all fears as to the\r\nconsequences of the war. Henry Adams, recalling days of humiliation in\r\nLondon during the Civil War, when his father was the American\r\nambassador, coolly remarked that it was \"the sudden appearance of\r\nGermany as the grizzly terror\" that \"frightened England into America's\r\narms\"; but the net result in keeping the field free for an easy triumph\r\nof American arms was none the less appreciated in Washington where,\r\ndespite outward calm, fears of European complications were never absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN POLICIES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND THE ORIENT\r\n\r\n=The Filipino Revolt against American Rule.=--In the sphere of domestic\r\npolitics, as well as in the field of foreign relations, the outcome of\r\nthe Spanish war exercised a marked influence. It introduced at once\r\nproblems of colonial administration and difficulties in adjusting trade\r\nrelations with the outlying dominions. These were furthermore\r\ncomplicated in the very beginning by the outbreak of an insurrection\r\nagainst American sovereignty in the Philippines. The leader of the\r\nrevolt, Aguinaldo, had been invited to join the American forces in\r\noverthrowing Spanish dominion, and he had assumed, apparently without\r\nwarrant, that independence would be the result of the joint operations.\r\nWhen the news reached him that the American flag had been substituted\r\nfor the Spanish flag, his resentment was keen. In February, 1899, there\r\noccurred a slight collision between his men and some American soldiers.\r\nThe conflict thus begun was followed by serious fighting which finally\r\ndwindled into a vexatious guerrilla warfare lasting three years and\r\ncosting heavily in men and money. Atrocities were committed by the\r\nnative insurrectionists and, sad to relate, they were repaid in kind;\r\nit was argued in defense of the army that the ordinary rules of warfare\r\nwere without terror to men accustomed to fighting like savages. In vain\r\ndid McKinley assure the Filipinos that the institutions and laws\r\nestablished in the islands would be designed \"not for our satisfaction\r\nor for the expression of our theoretical views, but for the happiness,\r\npeace, and prosperity of the people of the Philippine Islands.\" Nothing\r\nshort of military pressure could bring the warring revolutionists to\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n=Attacks on Republican \"Imperialism.\"=--The Filipino insurrection,\r\nfollowing so quickly upon the ratification of the treaty with Spain,\r\nmoved the American opponents of McKinley's colonial policies to redouble\r\ntheir denunciation of what they were pleased to call \"imperialism.\"\r\nSenator Hoar was more than usually caustic in his indictment of the new\r\ncourse. The revolt against American rule did but convince him of the\r\nfolly hidden in the first fateful measures. Everywhere he saw a\r\nconspiracy of silence and injustice. \"I have failed to discover in the\r\nspeeches, public or private, of the advocates of this war,\" he contended\r\nin the Senate, \"or in the press which supports it and them, a single\r\nexpression anywhere of a desire to do justice to the people of the\r\nPhilippine Islands, or of a desire to make known to the people of the\r\nUnited States the truth of the case.... The catchwords, the cries, the\r\npithy and pregnant phrases of which their speech is full, all mean\r\ndominion. They mean perpetual dominion.... There is not one of these\r\ngentlemen who will rise in his place and affirm that if he were a\r\nFilipino he would not do exactly as the Filipinos are doing; that he\r\nwould not despise them if they were to do otherwise. So much at least\r\nthey owe of respect to the dead and buried history--the dead and buried\r\nhistory so far as they can slay and bury it--of their country.\" In the\r\nway of practical suggestions, the Senator offered as a solution of the\r\nproblem: the recognition of independence, assistance in establishing\r\nself-government, and an invitation to all powers to join in a guarantee\r\nof freedom to the islands.\r\n\r\n=The Republican Answer.=--To McKinley and his supporters, engaged in a\r\nsanguinary struggle to maintain American supremacy, such talk was more\r\nthan quixotic; it was scarcely short of treasonable. They pointed out\r\nthe practical obstacles in the way of uniform self-government for a\r\ncollection of seven million people ranging in civilization from the most\r\nignorant hill men to the highly cultivated inhabitants of Manila. The\r\nincidents of the revolt and its repression, they admitted, were painful\r\nenough; but still nothing as compared with the chaos that would follow\r\nthe attempt of a people who had never had experience in such matters to\r\nset up and sustain democratic institutions. They preferred rather the\r\ngradual process of fitting the inhabitants of the islands for\r\nself-government. This course, in their eyes, though less poetic, was\r\nmore in harmony with the ideals of humanity. Having set out upon it,\r\nthey pursued it steadfastly to the end. First, they applied force\r\nwithout stint to the suppression of the revolt. Then they devoted such\r\ngenius for colonial administration as they could command to the\r\ndevelopment of civil government, commerce, and industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nA PHILIPPINE HOME]\r\n\r\n=The Boxer Rebellion in China.=--For a nation with a world-wide trade,\r\nsteadily growing, as the progress of home industries redoubled the zeal\r\nfor new markets, isolation was obviously impossible. Never was this\r\nclearer than in 1900 when a native revolt against foreigners in China,\r\nknown as the Boxer uprising, compelled the United States to join with\r\nthe powers of Europe in a military expedition and a diplomatic\r\nsettlement. The Boxers, a Chinese association, had for some time carried\r\non a campaign of hatred against all aliens in the Celestial empire,\r\ncalling upon the natives to rise in patriotic wrath and drive out the\r\nforeigners who, they said, \"were lacerating China like tigers.\" In the\r\nsummer of 1900 the revolt flamed up in deeds of cruelty. Missionaries\r\nand traders were murdered in the provinces; foreign legations were\r\nstoned; the German ambassador, one of the most cordially despised\r\nforeigners, was killed in the streets of Peking; and to all appearances\r\na frightful war of extermination had begun. In the month of June nearly\r\nfive hundred men, women, and children, representing all nations, were\r\nbesieged in the British quarters in Peking under constant fire of\r\nChinese guns and in peril of a terrible death.\r\n\r\n=Intervention in China.=--Nothing but the arrival of armed forces, made\r\nup of Japanese, Russian, British, American, French, and German soldiers\r\nand marines, prevented the destruction of the beleaguered aliens. When\r\nonce the foreign troops were in possession of the Chinese capital,\r\ndiplomatic questions of the most delicate character arose. For more than\r\nhalf a century, the imperial powers of Europe had been carving up the\r\nChinese empire, taking to themselves territory, railway concessions,\r\nmining rights, ports, and commercial privileges at the expense of the\r\nhuge but helpless victim. The United States alone among the great\r\nnations, while as zealous as any in the pursuit of peaceful trade, had\r\nrefrained from seizing Chinese territory or ports. Moreover, the\r\nDepartment of State had been urging European countries to treat China\r\nwith fairness, to respect her territorial integrity, and to give her\r\nequal trading privileges with all nations.\r\n\r\n=The American Policy of the \"Open Door.\"=--In the autumn of 1899,\r\nSecretary Hay had addressed to London, Berlin, Rome, Paris, Tokyo, and\r\nSt. Petersburg his famous note on the \"open door\" policy in China. In\r\nthis document he proposed that existing treaty ports and vested\r\ninterests of the several foreign countries should be respected; that\r\nthe Chinese government should be permitted to extend its tariffs to all\r\nports held by alien powers except the few free ports; and that there\r\nshould be no discrimination in railway and port charges among the\r\ncitizens of foreign countries operating in the empire. To these\r\nprinciples the governments addressed by Mr. Hay, finally acceded with\r\nevident reluctance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMERICAN DOMINIONS IN THE PACIFIC]\r\n\r\nOn this basis he then proposed the settlement that had to follow the\r\nBoxer uprising. \"The policy of the Government of the United States,\" he\r\nsaid to the great powers, in the summer of 1900, \"is to seek a solution\r\nwhich may bring about permanent safety and peace to China, preserve\r\nChinese territorial and administrative entity, protect all rights\r\nguaranteed to friendly powers by treaty and international law, and\r\nsafeguard for the world the principle of equal and impartial trade with\r\nall parts of the Chinese empire.\" This was a friendly warning to the\r\nworld that the United States would not join in a scramble to punish the\r\nChinese by carving out more territory. \"The moment we acted,\" said Mr.\r\nHay, \"the rest of the world paused and finally came over to our ground;\r\nand the German government, which is generally brutal but seldom silly,\r\nrecovered its senses, and climbed down off its perch.\"\r\n\r\nIn taking this position, the Secretary of State did but reflect the\r\ncommon sense of America. \"We are, of course,\" he explained, \"opposed to\r\nthe dismemberment of that empire and we do not think that the public\r\nopinion of the United States would justify this government in taking\r\npart in the great game of spoliation now going on.\" Heavy damages were\r\ncollected by the European powers from China for the injuries inflicted\r\nupon their citizens by the Boxers; but the United States, finding the\r\nsum awarded in excess of the legitimate claims, returned the balance in\r\nthe form of a fund to be applied to the education of Chinese students in\r\nAmerican universities. \"I would rather be, I think,\" said Mr. Hay, \"the\r\ndupe of China than the chum of the Kaiser.\" By pursuing a liberal\r\npolicy, he strengthened the hold of the United States upon the\r\naffections of the Chinese people and, in the long run, as he remarked\r\nhimself, safeguarded \"our great commercial interests in that Empire.\"\r\n\r\n=Imperialism in the Presidential Campaign of 1900.=--It is not strange\r\nthat the policy pursued by the Republican administration in disposing of\r\nthe questions raised by the Spanish War became one of the first issues\r\nin the presidential campaign of 1900. Anticipating attacks from every\r\nquarter, the Republicans, in renominating McKinley, set forth their\r\nposition in clear and ringing phrases: \"In accepting by the treaty of\r\nParis the just responsibility of our victories in the Spanish War the\r\nPresident and Senate won the undoubted approval of the American people.\r\nNo other course was possible than to destroy Spain's sovereignty\r\nthroughout the West Indies and in the Philippine Islands. That course\r\ncreated our responsibility, before the world and with the unorganized\r\npopulation whom our intervention had freed from Spain, to provide for\r\nthe maintenance of law and order, and for the establishment of good\r\ngovernment and for the performance of international obligations. Our\r\nauthority could not be less than our responsibility, and wherever\r\nsovereign rights were extended it became the high duty of the government\r\nto maintain its authority, to put down armed insurrection, and to confer\r\nthe blessings of liberty and civilization upon all the rescued peoples.\r\nThe largest measure of self-government consistent with their welfare and\r\nour duties shall be secured to them by law.\" To give more strength to\r\ntheir ticket, the Republican convention, in a whirlwind of enthusiasm,\r\nnominated for the vice presidency, against his protest, Theodore\r\nRoosevelt, the governor of New York and the hero of the Rough Riders, so\r\npopular on account of their Cuban campaign.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, as expected, picked up the gauntlet thrown down with such\r\ndefiance by the Republicans. Mr. Bryan, whom they selected as their\r\ncandidate, still clung to the currency issue; but the main emphasis,\r\nboth of the platform and the appeal for votes, was on the \"imperialistic\r\nprogram\" of the Republican administration. The Democrats denounced the\r\ntreatment of Cuba and Porto Rico and condemned the Philippine policy in\r\nsharp and vigorous terms. \"As we are not willing,\" ran the platform, \"to\r\nsurrender our civilization or to convert the Republic into an empire, we\r\nfavor an immediate declaration of the Nation's purpose to give to the\r\nFilipinos, first, a stable form of government; second, independence;\r\nthird, protection from outside interference.... The greedy commercialism\r\nwhich dictated the Philippine policy of the Republican administration\r\nattempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay, but even this\r\nsordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. The\r\nwar of 'criminal aggression' against the Filipinos entailing an annual\r\nexpense of many millions has already cost more than any possible profit\r\nthat could accrue from the entire Philippine trade for years to come....\r\nWe oppose militarism. It means conquest abroad and intimidation and\r\noppression at home. It means the strong arm which has ever been fatal to\r\nfree institutions. It is what millions of our citizens have fled from in\r\nEurope. It will impose upon our peace-loving people a large standing\r\narmy, an unnecessary burden of taxation, and would be a constant menace\r\nto their liberties.\" Such was the tenor of their appeal to the voters.\r\n\r\nWith the issues clearly joined, the country rejected the Democratic\r\ncandidate even more positively than four years before. The popular vote\r\ncast for McKinley was larger and that cast for Bryan smaller than in the\r\nsilver election. Thus vindicated at the polls, McKinley turned with\r\nrenewed confidence to the development of the policies he had so far\r\nadvanced. But fate cut short his designs. In the September following his\r\nsecond inauguration, he was shot by an anarchist while attending the\r\nBuffalo exposition. \"What a strange and tragic fate it has been of\r\nmine,\" wrote the Secretary of State, John Hay, on the day of the\r\nPresident's death, \"to stand by the bier of three of my dearest friends,\r\nLincoln, Garfield, and McKinley, three of the gentlest of men, all risen\r\nto the head of the state and all done to death by assassins.\" On\r\nSeptember 14, 1901, the Vice President, Theodore Roosevelt, took up the\r\nlines of power that had fallen from the hands of his distinguished\r\nchief, promising to continue \"absolutely unbroken\" the policies he had\r\ninherited.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF NATIONAL GROWTH AND WORLD POLITICS\r\n\r\nThe economic aspects of the period between 1865 and 1900 may be readily\r\nsummed up: the recovery of the South from the ruin of the Civil War, the\r\nextension of the railways, the development of the Great West, and the\r\ntriumph of industry and business enterprise. In the South many of the\r\ngreat plantations were broken up and sold in small farms, crops were\r\ndiversified, the small farming class was raised in the scale of social\r\nimportance, the cotton industry was launched, and the coal, iron,\r\ntimber, and other resources were brought into use. In the West the free\r\narable land was practically exhausted by 1890 under the terms of the\r\nHomestead Act; gold, silver, copper, coal and other minerals were\r\ndiscovered in abundance; numerous rail connections were formed with the\r\nAtlantic seaboard; the cowboy and the Indian were swept away before a\r\nstandardized civilization of electric lights and bathtubs. By the end of\r\nthe century the American frontier had disappeared. The wild, primitive\r\nlife so long associated with America was gone. The unity of the nation\r\nwas established.\r\n\r\nIn the field of business enterprise, progress was most marked. The\r\nindustrial system, which had risen and flourished before the Civil War,\r\ngrew into immense proportions and the industrial area was extended from\r\nthe Northeast into all parts of the country. Small business concerns\r\nwere transformed into huge corporations. Individual plants were merged\r\nunder the management of gigantic trusts. Short railway lines were\r\nconsolidated into national systems. The industrial population of\r\nwage-earners rose into the tens of millions. The immigration of aliens\r\nincreased by leaps and bounds. The cities overshadowed the country. The\r\nnation that had once depended upon Europe for most of its manufactured\r\ngoods became a competitor of Europe in the markets of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of politics, the period witnessed the recovery of white\r\nsupremacy in the South; the continued discussion of the old questions,\r\nsuch as the currency, the tariff, and national banking; and the\r\ninjection of new issues like the trusts and labor problems. As of old,\r\nforeign affairs were kept well at the front. Alaska was purchased from\r\nRussia; attempts were made to extend American influence in the Caribbean\r\nregion; a Samoan island was brought under the flag; and the Hawaiian\r\nislands were annexed. The Monroe Doctrine was applied with vigor in the\r\ndispute between Venezuela and Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAssistance was given to the Cubans in their revolutionary struggle\r\nagainst Spain and thus there was precipitated a war which ended in the\r\nannexation of Porto Rico and the Philippines. American influence in the\r\nPacific and the Orient was so enlarged as to be a factor of great weight\r\nin world affairs. Thus questions connected with foreign and \"imperial\"\r\npolicies were united with domestic issues to make up the warp and woof\r\nof politics. In the direction of affairs, the Republicans took the\r\nleadership, for they held the presidency during all the years, except\r\neight, between 1865 and 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n=References=\r\n\r\nJ.W.

PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE EVOLUTION OF REPUBLICAN POLICIES (1901-13)\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Personality and Early Career of Roosevelt.=--On September 14, 1901,\r\nwhen Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office, the presidency passed\r\nto a new generation and a leader of a new type recalling, if comparisons\r\nmust be made, Andrew Jackson rather than any Republican predecessor.\r\nRoosevelt was brusque, hearty, restless, and fond of action--\"a young\r\nfellow of infinite dash and originality,\" as John Hay remarked of him;\r\ncombining the spirit of his old college, Harvard, with the breezy\r\nfreedom of the plains; interested in everything--a new species of game,\r\na new book, a diplomatic riddle, or a novel theory of history or\r\nbiology. Though only forty-three years old he was well versed in the art\r\nof practical politics. Coming upon the political scene in the early\r\neighties, he had associated himself with the reformers in the Republican\r\nparty; but he was no Mugwump. From the first he vehemently preached the\r\ndoctrine of party loyalty; if beaten in the convention, he voted the\r\nstraight ticket in the election. For twenty years he adhered to this\r\nrule and during a considerable portion of that period he held office as\r\na spokesman of his party. He served in the New York legislature, as head\r\nof the metropolitan police force, as federal civil service commissioner\r\nunder President Harrison, as assistant secretary of the navy under\r\nPresident McKinley, and as governor of the Empire state. Political\r\nmanagers of the old school spoke of him as \"brilliant but erratic\"; they\r\nsoon found him equal to the shrewdest in negotiation and action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nROOSEVELT TALKING TO THE ENGINEER OF A RAILROAD TRAIN]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n=The Panama Canal.=--The most important foreign question confronting\r\nPresident Roosevelt on the day of his inauguration, that of the Panama\r\nCanal, was a heritage from his predecessor. The idea of a water route\r\nacross the isthmus, long a dream of navigators, had become a living\r\nissue after the historic voyage of the battleship _Oregon_ around South\r\nAmerica during the Spanish War. But before the United States could act\r\nit had to undo the Clayton-Bulwer treaty, made with Great Britain in\r\n1850, providing for the construction of the canal under joint\r\nsupervision. This was finally effected by the Hay-Pauncefote treaty of\r\n1901 authorizing the United States to proceed alone, on condition that\r\nthere should be no discriminations against other nations in the matter\r\nof rates and charges.\r\n\r\nThis accomplished, it was necessary to decide just where the canal\r\nshould be built. One group in Congress favored the route through\r\nNicaragua; in fact, two official commissions had already approved that\r\nlocation. Another group favored cutting the way through Panama after\r\npurchasing the rights of the old French company which, under the\r\ndirection of De Lesseps, the hero of the Suez Canal, had made a costly\r\nfailure some twenty years before. After a heated argument over the\r\nmerits of the two plans, preference was given to the Panama route. As\r\nthe isthmus was then a part of Colombia, President Roosevelt proceeded\r\nto negotiate with the government at Bogota a treaty authorizing the\r\nUnited States to cut a canal through its territory. The treaty was\r\neasily framed, but it was rejected by the Colombian senate, much to the\r\nPresident's exasperation. \"You could no more make an agreement with the\r\nColombian rulers,\" he exclaimed, \"than you could nail jelly to a wall.\"\r\nHe was spared the necessity by a timely revolution. On November 3, 1903,\r\nPanama renounced its allegiance to Colombia and three days later the\r\nUnited States recognized its independence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy of Panama Canal, Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\nDEEPEST EXCAVATED PORTION OF PANAMA CANAL, SHOWING GOLD HILL ON\r\nRIGHT AND CONTRACTOR'S HILL ON LEFT. JUNE, 1913]\r\n\r\nThis amazing incident was followed shortly by the signature of a treaty\r\nbetween Panama and the United States in which the latter secured the\r\nright to construct the long-discussed canal, in return for a guarantee\r\nof independence and certain cash payments. The rights and property of\r\nthe French concern were then bought, and the final details settled. A\r\nlock rather than a sea-level canal was agreed upon. Construction by the\r\ngovernment directly instead of by private contractors was adopted.\r\nScientific medicine was summoned to stamp out the tropical diseases\r\nthat had made Panama a plague spot. Finally, in 1904, as the President\r\nsaid, \"the dirt began to fly.\" After surmounting formidable\r\ndifficulties--engineering, labor, and sanitary--the American forces in\r\n1913 joined the waters of the Atlantic and the Pacific. Nearly eight\r\nthousand miles were cut off the sea voyage from New York to San\r\nFrancisco. If any were inclined to criticize President Roosevelt for\r\nthe way in which he snapped off negotiations with Colombia and\r\nrecognized the Panama revolutionists, their attention was drawn to the\r\nmagnificent outcome of the affair. Notwithstanding the treaty with Great\r\nBritain, Congress passed a tolls bill discriminating in rates in favor\r\nof American ships. It was only on the urgent insistence of President\r\nWilson that the measure was later repealed.\r\n\r\n=The Conclusion of the Russo-Japanese War.=--The applause which greeted\r\nthe President's next diplomatic stroke was unmarred by censure of any\r\nkind. In the winter of 1904 there broke out between Japan and Russia a\r\nterrible conflict over the division of spoils in Manchuria. The fortunes\r\nof war were with the agile forces of Nippon. In this struggle, it seems,\r\nPresident Roosevelt's sympathies were mainly with the Japanese, although\r\nhe observed the proprieties of neutrality. At all events, Secretary Hay\r\nwrote in his diary on New Year's Day, 1905, that the President was\r\n\"quite firm in his view that we cannot permit Japan to be robbed a\r\nsecond time of her victory,\" referring to the fact that Japan, ten years\r\nbefore, after defeating China on the field of battle, had been forced by\r\nRussia, Germany, and France to forego the fruits of conquest.\r\n\r\nWhatever the President's personal feelings may have been, he was aware\r\nthat Japan, despite her triumphs over Russia, was staggering under a\r\nheavy burden of debt. At a suggestion from Tokyo, he invited both\r\nbelligerents in the summer of 1905 to join in a peace conference. The\r\ncelerity of their reply was aided by the pressure of European bankers,\r\nwho had already come to a substantial agreement that the war must stop.\r\nAfter some delay, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, was chosen as the meeting\r\nplace for the spokesmen of the two warring powers. Roosevelt presided\r\nover the opening ceremonies with fine urbanity, thoroughly enjoying the\r\njustly earned honor of being for the moment at the center of the world's\r\ninterest. He had the satisfaction of seeing the conference end in a\r\ntreaty of peace and amity.\r\n\r\n=The Monroe Doctrine Applied to Germany.=--Less spectacular than the\r\nRusso-Japanese settlement but not less important was a diplomatic\r\npassage-at-arms with Germany over the Monroe Doctrine. This clash grew\r\nout of the inability or unwillingness of the Venezuelan government to\r\npay debts due foreign creditors. Having exhausted their patience in\r\nnegotiations, England and Germany, in December 1901, sent battleships to\r\nestablish what they characterized as \"a peaceful blockade\" of Venezuelan\r\nports. Their action was followed by the rupture of diplomatic relations;\r\nthere was a possibility that war and the occupation of Venezuelan\r\nterritory might result.\r\n\r\nWhile unwilling to stand between a Latin-American country and its\r\ncreditors, President Roosevelt was determined that debt collecting\r\nshould not be made an excuse for European countries to seize territory.\r\nHe therefore urged arbitration of the dispute, winning the assent of\r\nEngland and Italy. Germany, with a somewhat haughty air, refused to take\r\nthe milder course. The President, learning of this refusal, called the\r\nGerman ambassador to the White House and informed him in very precise\r\nterms that, unless the Imperial German Government consented to\r\narbitrate, Admiral Dewey would be ordered to the scene with instructions\r\nto prevent Germany from seizing any Venezuelan territory. A week passed\r\nand no answer came from Berlin. Not baffled, the President again took\r\nthe matter up with the ambassador, this time with even more firmness; he\r\nstated in language admitting of but one meaning that, unless within\r\nforty-eight hours the Emperor consented to arbitration, American\r\nbattleships, already coaled and cleared, would sail for Venezuelan\r\nwaters. The hint was sufficient. The Kaiser accepted the proposal and\r\nthe President, with the fine irony of diplomacy, complimented him\r\npublicly on \"being so stanch an advocate of arbitration.\" In terms of\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine this action meant that the United States, while not\r\ndenying the obligations of debtors, would not permit any move on the\r\npart of European powers that might easily lead to the temporary or\r\npermanent occupation of Latin-American territory.\r\n\r\n=The Santo Domingo Affair.=--The same issue was involved in a\r\ncontroversy over Santo Domingo which arose in 1904. The Dominican\r\nrepublic, like Venezuela, was heavily in debt, and certain European\r\ncountries declared that, unless the United States undertook to look\r\nafter the finances of the embarrassed debtor, they would resort to armed\r\ncoercion. What was the United States to do? The danger of having some\r\nEuropean power strongly intrenched in Santo Domingo was too imminent to\r\nbe denied. President Roosevelt acted with characteristic speed, and\r\nnotwithstanding strong opposition in the Senate was able, in 1907, to\r\neffect a treaty arrangement which placed Dominican finances under\r\nAmerican supervision.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the debate over this settlement, a number of\r\ninteresting questions arose. It was pertinently asked whether the\r\nAmerican navy should be used to help creditors collect their debts\r\nanywhere in Latin-America. It was suggested also that no sanction should\r\nbe given to the practice among European governments of using armed force\r\nto collect private claims. Opponents of President Roosevelt's policy,\r\nand they were neither few nor insignificant, urged that such matters\r\nshould be referred to the Hague Court or to special international\r\ncommissions for arbitration. To this the answer was made that the United\r\nStates could not surrender any question coming under the terms of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine to the decision of an international tribunal. The\r\nposition of the administration was very clearly stated by President\r\nRoosevelt himself. \"The country,\" he said, \"would certainly decline to\r\ngo to war to prevent a foreign government from collecting a just debt;\r\non the other hand, it is very inadvisable to permit any foreign power to\r\ntake possession, even temporarily, of the customs houses of an American\r\nrepublic in order to enforce the payment of its obligations; for such a\r\ntemporary occupation might turn into a permanent occupation. The only\r\nescape from these alternatives may at any time be that we must\r\nourselves undertake to bring about some arrangement by which so much as\r\npossible of a just obligation shall be paid.\" The Monroe Doctrine was\r\nnegative. It denied to European powers a certain liberty of operation in\r\nthis hemisphere. The positive obligations resulting from its application\r\nby the United States were points now emphasized and developed.\r\n\r\n=The Hague Conference.=--The controversies over Latin-American relations\r\nand his part in bringing the Russo-Japanese War to a close naturally\r\nmade a deep impression upon Roosevelt, turning his mind in the direction\r\nof the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The subject was\r\nmoreover in the air. As if conscious of impending calamity, the\r\nstatesmen of the Old World, to all outward signs at least, seemed\r\nsearching for a way to reduce armaments and avoid the bloody and costly\r\ntrial of international causes by the ancient process of battle. It was\r\nthe Czar, Nicholas II, fated to die in one of the terrible holocausts\r\nwhich he helped to bring upon mankind, who summoned the delegates of the\r\nnations in the first Hague Peace Conference in 1899. The conference did\r\nnothing to reduce military burdens or avoid wars but it did recognize\r\nthe right of friendly nations to offer the services of mediation to\r\ncountries at war and did establish a Court at the Hague for the\r\narbitration of international disputes.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this experiment, feeble as it was, President Roosevelt in\r\n1904 proposed a second conference, yielding to the Czar the honor of\r\nissuing the call. At this great international assembly, held at the\r\nHague in 1907, the representatives of the United States proposed a plan\r\nfor the compulsory arbitration of certain matters of international\r\ndispute. This was rejected with contempt by Germany. Reduction of\r\narmaments, likewise proposed in the conference, was again deferred. In\r\nfact, nothing was accomplished beyond agreement upon certain rules for\r\nthe conduct of \"civilized warfare,\" casting a somewhat lurid light upon\r\nthe \"pacific\" intentions of most of the powers assembled.\r\n\r\n=The World Tour of the Fleet.=--As if to assure the world then that the\r\nUnited States placed little reliance upon the frail reed of peace\r\nconferences, Roosevelt the following year (1908) made an imposing\r\ndisplay of American naval power by sending a fleet of sixteen\r\nbattleships on a tour around the globe. On his own authority, he ordered\r\nthe ships to sail out of Hampton Roads and circle the earth by way of\r\nthe Straits of Magellan, San Francisco, Australia, the Philippines,\r\nChina, Japan, and the Suez Canal. This enterprise was not, as some\r\ncritics claimed, a \"mere boyish flourish.\" President Roosevelt knew how\r\ndeep was the influence of sea power on the fate of nations. He was aware\r\nthat no country could have a wide empire of trade and dominion without\r\nforce adequate to sustain it. The voyage around the world therefore\r\nserved a double purpose. It interested his own country in the naval\r\nprogram of the government, and it reminded other powers that the\r\nAmerican giant, though quiet, was not sleeping in the midst of\r\ninternational rivalries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n=A Constitutional Question Settled.=--In colonial administration, as in\r\nforeign policy, President Roosevelt advanced with firm step in a path\r\nalready marked out. President McKinley had defined the principles that\r\nwere to control the development of Porto Rico and the Philippines. The\r\nRepublican party had announced a program of pacification, gradual\r\nself-government, and commercial improvement. The only remaining question\r\nof importance, to use the popular phrase,--\"Does the Constitution follow\r\nthe flag?\"--had been answered by the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\nAlthough it was well known that the Constitution did not contemplate the\r\ngovernment of dependencies, such as the Philippines and Porto Rico, the\r\nCourt, by generous and ingenious interpretations, found a way for\r\nCongress to apply any reasonable rules required by the occasion.\r\n\r\n=Porto Rico.=--The government of Porto Rico was a relatively simple\r\nmatter. It was a single island with a fairly homogeneous population\r\napart from the Spanish upper class. For a time after military occupation\r\nin 1898, it was administered under military rule. This was succeeded by\r\nthe establishment of civil government under the \"organic act\" passed by\r\nCongress in 1900. The law assured to the Porto Ricans American\r\nprotection but withheld American citizenship--a boon finally granted in\r\n1917. It provided for a governor and six executive secretaries appointed\r\nby the President with the approval of the Senate; and for a legislature\r\nof two houses--one elected by popular native vote, and an upper chamber\r\ncomposed of the executive secretaries and five other persons appointed\r\nin the same manner. Thus the United States turned back to the provincial\r\nsystem maintained by England in Virginia or New York in old colonial\r\ndays. The natives were given a voice in their government and the power\r\nof initiating laws; but the final word both in law-making and\r\nadministration was vested in officers appointed in Washington. Such was\r\nthe plan under which the affairs of Porto Rico were conducted by\r\nPresident Roosevelt. It lasted until the new organic act of 1917.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photograph from Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nA SUGAR MILL, PORTO RICO]\r\n\r\n=The Philippines.=--The administration of the Philippines presented far\r\nmore difficult questions. The number of islands, the variety of\r\nlanguages and races, the differences in civilization all combined to\r\nchallenge the skill of the government. Moreover, there was raging in\r\n1901 a stubborn revolt against American authority, which had to be\r\nfaced. Following the lines laid down by President McKinley, the\r\nevolution of American policy fell into three stages. At first the\r\nislands were governed directly by the President under his supreme\r\nmilitary power. In 1901 a civilian commission, headed by William Howard\r\nTaft, was selected by the President and charged with the government of\r\nthe provinces in which order had been restored. Six years later, under\r\nthe terms of an organic act, passed by Congress in 1902, the third stage\r\nwas reached. The local government passed into the hands of a governor\r\nand commission, appointed by the President and Senate, and a\r\nlegislature--one house elected by popular vote and an upper chamber\r\ncomposed of the commission. This scheme, like that obtaining in Porto\r\nRico, remained intact until a Democratic Congress under President\r\nWilson's leadership carried the colonial administration into its fourth\r\nphase by making both houses elective. Thus, by the steady pursuit of a\r\nliberal policy, self-government was extended to the dependencies; but it\r\nencouraged rather than extinguished the vigorous movement among the\r\nPhilippine natives for independence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nMR TAFT IN THE PHILIPPINES]\r\n\r\n=Cuban Relations.=--Within the sphere of colonial affairs, Cuba, though\r\nnominally independent, also presented problems to the government at\r\nWashington. In the fine enthusiasm that accompanied the declaration of\r\nwar on Spain, Congress, unmindful of practical considerations,\r\nrecognized the independence of Cuba and disclaimed \"any disposition or\r\nintention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over said\r\nisland except for the pacification thereof.\" In the settlement that\r\nfollowed the war, however, it was deemed undesirable to set the young\r\nrepublic adrift upon the stormy sea of international politics without a\r\nguiding hand. Before withdrawing American troops from the island,\r\nCongress, in March, 1901, enacted, and required Cuba to approve, a\r\nseries of restrictions known as the Platt amendment, limiting her power\r\nto incur indebtedness, securing the right of the United States to\r\nintervene whenever necessary to protect life and property, and reserving\r\nto the United States coaling stations at certain points to be agreed\r\nupon. The Cubans made strong protests against what they deemed\r\n\"infringements of their sovereignty\"; but finally with good grace\r\naccepted their fate. Even when in 1906 President Roosevelt landed\r\nAmerican troops in the island to quell a domestic dissension, they\r\nacquiesced in the action, evidently regarding it as a distinct warning\r\nthat they should learn to manage their elections in an orderly manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROOSEVELT DOMESTIC POLICIES\r\n\r\n=Social Questions to the Front.=--From the day of his inauguration to\r\nthe close of his service in 1909, President Roosevelt, in messages,\r\nspeeches, and interviews, kept up a lively and interesting discussion of\r\ntrusts, capital, labor, poverty, riches, lawbreaking, good citizenship,\r\nand kindred themes. Many a subject previously touched upon only by\r\nrepresentatives of the minor and dissenting parties, he dignified by a\r\ncareful examination. That he did this with any fixed design or policy in\r\nmind does not seem to be the case. He admitted himself that when he\r\nbecame President he did not have in hand any settled or far-reaching\r\nplan of social betterment. He did have, however, serious convictions on\r\ngeneral principles. \"I was bent upon making the government,\" he wrote,\r\n\"the most efficient possible instrument in helping the people of the\r\nUnited States to better themselves in every way, politically, socially,\r\nand industrially. I believed with all my heart in real and\r\nthorough-going democracy and I wished to make the democracy industrial\r\nas well as political, although I had only partially formulated the\r\nmethod I believed we should follow.\" It is thus evident at least that he\r\nhad departed a long way from the old idea of the government as nothing\r\nbut a great policeman keeping order among the people in a struggle over\r\nthe distribution of the nation's wealth and resources.\r\n\r\n=Roosevelt's View of the Constitution.=--Equally significant was\r\nRoosevelt's attitude toward the Constitution and the office of\r\nPresident. He utterly repudiated the narrow construction of our national\r\ncharter. He held that the Constitution \"should be treated as the\r\ngreatest document ever devised by the wit of man to aid a people in\r\nexercising every power necessary for its own betterment, not as a\r\nstrait-jacket cunningly fashioned to strangle growth.\" He viewed the\r\npresidency as he did the Constitution. Strict constructionists of the\r\nJeffersonian school, of whom there were many on occasion even in the\r\nRepublican party, had taken a view that the President could do nothing\r\nthat he was not specifically authorized by the Constitution to do.\r\nRoosevelt took exactly the opposite position. It was his opinion that it\r\nwas not only the President's right but his duty \"to do anything that the\r\nneeds of the nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the\r\nConstitution or the laws.\" He went on to say that he acted \"for the\r\ncommon well-being of all our people whenever and in whatever manner was\r\nnecessary, unless prevented by direct constitutional or legislative\r\nprohibition.\"\r\n\r\n=The Trusts and Railways.=--To the trust question, Roosevelt devoted\r\nespecial attention. This was unavoidable. By far the larger part of the\r\nbusiness of the country was done by corporations as distinguished from\r\npartnerships and individual owners. The growth of these gigantic\r\naggregations of capital had been the leading feature in American\r\nindustrial development during the last two decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In the conquest of business by trusts and \"the resulting\r\nprivate fortunes of great magnitude,\" the Populists and the Democrats\r\nhad seen a grievous danger to the republic. \"Plutocracy has taken the\r\nplace of democracy; the tariff breeds trusts; let us destroy therefore\r\nthe tariff and the trusts\"--such was the battle cry which had been taken\r\nup by Bryan and his followers.\r\n\r\nPresident Roosevelt countered vigorously. He rejected the idea that the\r\ntrusts were the product of the tariff or of governmental action of any\r\nkind. He insisted that they were the outcome of \"natural economic\r\nforces\": (1) destructive competition among business men compelling them\r\nto avoid ruin by coöperation in fixing prices; (2) the growth of markets\r\non a national scale and even international scale calling for vast\r\naccumulations of capital to carry on such business; (3) the possibility\r\nof immense savings by the union of many plants under one management. In\r\nthe corporation he saw a new stage in the development of American\r\nindustry. Unregulated competition he regarded as \"the source of evils\r\nwhich all men concede must be remedied if this civilization of ours is\r\nto survive.\" The notion, therefore, that these immense business concerns\r\nshould be or could be broken up by a decree of law, Roosevelt considered\r\nabsurd.\r\n\r\nAt the same time he proposed that \"evil trusts\" should be prevented from\r\n\"wrong-doing of any kind\"; that is, punished for plain swindling, for\r\nmaking agreements to limit output, for refusing to sell to customers who\r\ndealt with rival firms, and for conspiracies with railways to ruin\r\ncompetitors by charging high freight rates and for similar abuses.\r\nAccordingly, he proposed, not the destruction of the trusts, but their\r\nregulation by the government. This, he contended, would preserve the\r\nadvantages of business on a national scale while preventing the evils\r\nthat accompanied it. The railway company he declared to be a public\r\nservant. \"Its rates should be just to and open to all shippers alike.\"\r\nSo he answered those who thought that trusts and railway combinations\r\nwere private concerns to be managed solely by their owners without let\r\nor hindrance and also those who thought trusts and railway combinations\r\ncould be abolished by tariff reduction or criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n=The Labor Question.=--On the labor question, then pressing to the front\r\nin public interest, President Roosevelt took advanced ground for his\r\ntime. He declared that the working-man, single-handed and empty-handed,\r\nthreatened with starvation if unemployed, was no match for the employer\r\nwho was able to bargain and wait. This led him, accordingly, to accept\r\nthe principle of the trade union; namely, that only by collective\r\nbargaining can labor be put on a footing to measure its strength equally\r\nwith capital. While he severely arraigned labor leaders who advocated\r\nviolence and destructive doctrines, he held that \"the organization of\r\nlabor into trade unions and federations is necessary, is beneficent, and\r\nis one of the greatest possible agencies in the attainment of a true\r\nindustrial, as well as a true political, democracy in the United\r\nStates.\" The last resort of trade unions in labor disputes, the strike,\r\nhe approved in case negotiations failed to secure \"a fair deal.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought, however, that labor organizations, even if wisely managed,\r\ncould not solve all the pressing social questions of the time. The aid\r\nof the government at many points he believed to be necessary to\r\neliminate undeserved poverty, industrial diseases, unemployment, and the\r\nunfortunate consequences of industrial accidents. In his first message\r\nof 1901, for instance, he urged that workers injured in industry should\r\nhave certain and ample compensation. From time to time he advocated\r\nother legislation to obtain what he called \"a larger measure of social\r\nand industrial justice.\"\r\n\r\n=Great Riches and Taxation.=--Even the challenge of the radicals, such\r\nas the Populists, who alleged that \"the toil of millions is boldly\r\nstolen to build up colossal fortunes for a few\"--challenges which his\r\npredecessors did not consider worthy of notice--President Roosevelt\r\nrefused to let pass without an answer. In his first message he denied\r\nthe truth of the common saying that the rich were growing richer and the\r\npoor were growing poorer. He asserted that, on the contrary, the average\r\nman, wage worker, farmer, and small business man, was better off than\r\never before in the history of our country. That there had been abuses in\r\nthe accumulation of wealth he did not pretend to ignore, but he believed\r\nthat even immense fortunes, on the whole, represented positive benefits\r\nconferred upon the country. Nevertheless he felt that grave dangers to\r\nthe safety and the happiness of the people lurked in great inequalities\r\nof wealth. In 1906 he wrote that he wished it were in his power to\r\nprevent the heaping up of enormous fortunes. The next year, to the\r\nastonishment of many leaders in his own party, he boldly announced in a\r\nmessage to Congress that he approved both income and inheritance taxes,\r\nthen generally viewed as Populist or Democratic measures. He even took\r\nthe stand that such taxes should be laid in order to bring about a more\r\nequitable distribution of wealth and greater equality of opportunity\r\namong citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n=Economic Legislation.=--When President Roosevelt turned from the field\r\nof opinion he found himself in a different sphere. Many of his views\r\nwere too advanced for the members of his party in Congress, and where\r\nresults depended upon the making of new laws, his progress was slow.\r\nNevertheless, in his administrations several measures were enacted that\r\nbore the stamp of his theories, though it could hardly be said that he\r\ndominated Congress to the same degree as did some other Presidents. The\r\nHepburn Railway Act of 1906 enlarged the interstate commerce commission;\r\nit extended the commission's power over oil pipe lines, express\r\ncompanies, and other interstate carriers; it gave the commission the\r\nright to reduce rates found to be unreasonable and discriminatory; it\r\nforbade \"midnight tariffs,\" that is, sudden changes in rates favoring\r\ncertain shippers; and it prohibited common carriers from transporting\r\ngoods owned by themselves, especially coal, except for their own proper\r\nuse. Two important pure food and drug laws, enacted during the same\r\nyear, were designed to protect the public against diseased meats and\r\ndeleterious foods and drugs. A significant piece of labor legislation\r\nwas an act of the same Congress making interstate railways liable to\r\ndamages for injuries sustained by their employees. When this measure was\r\ndeclared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court it was reënacted with the\r\nobjectionable clauses removed. A second installment of labor legislation\r\nwas offered in the law of 1908 limiting the hours of railway employees\r\nengaged as trainmen or telegraph operators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Courtesy United States Reclamation Service._\r\n\r\nTHE ROOSEVELT DAM, PHOENIX, ARIZONA]\r\n\r\n=Reclamation and Conservation.=--The open country--the deserts, the\r\nforests, waterways, and the public lands--interested President Roosevelt\r\nno less than railway and industrial questions. Indeed, in his first\r\nmessage to Congress he placed the conservation of natural resources\r\namong \"the most vital internal problems\" of the age, and forcibly\r\nemphasized an issue that had been discussed in a casual way since\r\nCleveland's first administration. The suggestion evoked an immediate\r\nresponse in Congress. Under the leadership of Senator Newlands, of\r\nNevada, the Reclamation Act of 1902 was passed, providing for the\r\nredemption of the desert areas of the West. The proceeds from the sale\r\nof public lands were dedicated to the construction of storage dams and\r\nsluiceways to hold water and divert it as needed to the thirsty sands.\r\nFurthermore it was stipulated that the rents paid by water users should\r\ngo into a reclamation fund to continue the good work forever.\r\nConstruction was started immediately under the terms of the law. Within\r\nseventeen years about 1,600,000 acres had been reclaimed and more than a\r\nmillion were actually irrigated. In the single year 1918, the crops of\r\nthe irrigated districts were valued at approximately $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn his first message, also, President Roosevelt urged the transfer of\r\nall control over national forests to trained men in the Bureau of\r\nForestry--a recommendation carried out in 1907 when the Forestry Service\r\nwas created. In every direction noteworthy advances were made in the\r\nadministration of the national domain. The science of forestry was\r\nimproved and knowledge of the subject spread among the people. Lands in\r\nthe national forest available for agriculture were opened to settlers.\r\nWater power sites on the public domain were leased for a term of years\r\nto private companies instead of being sold outright. The area of the\r\nnational forests was enlarged from 43 million acres to 194 million acres\r\nby presidential proclamation--more than 43 million acres being added in\r\none year, 1907. The men who turned sheep and cattle to graze on the\r\npublic lands were compelled to pay a fair rental, much to their\r\ndissatisfaction. Fire prevention work was undertaken in the forests on a\r\nlarge scale, reducing the appalling, annual destruction of timber.\r\nMillions of acres of coal land, such as the government had been\r\ncarelessly selling to mining companies at low figures, were withdrawn\r\nfrom sale and held until Congress was prepared to enact laws for the\r\ndisposition of them in the public interest. Prosecutions were\r\ninstituted against men who had obtained public lands by fraud and vast\r\ntracts were recovered for the national domain. An agitation was begun\r\nwhich bore fruit under the administrations of Taft and Wilson in laws\r\nreserving to the federal government the ownership of coal, water power,\r\nphosphates, and other natural resources while authorizing corporations\r\nto develop them under leases for a period of years.\r\n\r\n=The Prosecution of the Trusts.=--As an executive, President Roosevelt\r\nwas also a distinct \"personality.\" His discrimination between \"good\" and\r\n\"bad\" trusts led him to prosecute some of them with vigor. On his\r\ninitiative, the Northern Securities Company, formed to obtain control of\r\ncertain great western railways, was dissolved by order of the Supreme\r\nCourt. Proceedings were instituted against the American Tobacco Company\r\nand the Standard Oil Company as monopolies in violation of the Sherman\r\nAnti-Trust law. The Sugar Trust was found guilty of cheating the New\r\nYork customs house and some of the minor officers were sent to prison.\r\nFrauds in the Post-office Department were uncovered and the offenders\r\nbrought to book. In fact hardly a week passed without stirring news of\r\n\"wrong doers\" and \"malefactors\" haled into federal courts.\r\n\r\n=The Great Coal Strike.=--The Roosevelt theory that the President could\r\ndo anything for public welfare not forbidden by the Constitution and the\r\nlaws was put to a severe test in 1902. A strike of the anthracite coal\r\nminers, which started in the summer, ran late into the autumn.\r\nIndustries were paralyzed for the want of coal; cities were threatened\r\nwith the appalling menace of a winter without heat. Governors and mayors\r\nwere powerless and appealed for aid. The mine owners rejected the\r\ndemands of the men and refused to permit the arbitration of the points\r\nin dispute, although John Mitchell, the leader of the miners, repeatedly\r\nurged it. After observing closely the course affairs, President\r\nRoosevelt made up his mind that the situation was intolerable. He\r\narranged to have the federal troops, if necessary, take possession of\r\nthe mines and operate them until the strike could be settled. He then\r\ninvited the contestants to the White House and by dint of hard labor\r\ninduced them to accept, as a substitute or compromise, arbitration by a\r\ncommission which he appointed. Thus, by stepping outside the\r\nConstitution and acting as the first citizen of the land, President\r\nRoosevelt averted a crisis of great magnitude.\r\n\r\n=The Election of 1904.=--The views and measures which he advocated with\r\nsuch vigor aroused deep hostility within as well as without his party.\r\nThere were rumors of a Republican movement to defeat his nomination in\r\n1904 and it was said that the \"financial and corporation interests\" were\r\nin arms against him. A prominent Republican paper in New York City\r\naccused him of having \"stolen Mr. Bryan's thunder,\" by harrying the\r\ntrusts and favoring labor unions. When the Republican convention\r\nassembled in Chicago, however, the opposition disappeared and Roosevelt\r\nwas nominated by acclamation.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for a change on the part of Democratic leaders. They\r\ndenounced the President as erratic, dangerous, and radical and decided\r\nto assume the moderate rôle themselves. They put aside Mr. Bryan and\r\nselected as their candidate, Judge Alton B. Parker, of New York, a man\r\nwho repudiated free silver and made a direct appeal for the conservative\r\nvote. The outcome of the reversal was astounding. Judge Parker's vote\r\nfell more than a million below that cast for Bryan in 1900; of the 476\r\nelectoral votes he received only 140. Roosevelt, in addition to sweeping\r\nthe Republican sections, even invaded Democratic territory, carrying the\r\nstate of Missouri. Thus vindicated at the polls, he became more\r\noutspoken than ever. His leadership in the party was so widely\r\nrecognized that he virtually selected his own successor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADMINISTRATION OF PRESIDENT TAFT\r\n\r\n=The Campaign of 1908.=--Long before the end of his elective term,\r\nPresident Roosevelt let it be known that he favored as his successor,\r\nWilliam Howard Taft, of Ohio, his Secretary of War. To attain this end\r\nhe used every shred of his powerful influence. When the Republican\r\nconvention assembled, Mr. Taft easily won the nomination. Though the\r\nparty platform was conservative in tone, he gave it a progressive tinge\r\nby expressing his personal belief in the popular election of United\r\nStates Senators, an income tax, and other liberal measures. President\r\nRoosevelt announced his faith in the Republican candidate and appealed\r\nto the country for his election.\r\n\r\nThe turn in Republican affairs now convinced Mr. Bryan that the signs\r\nwere propitious for a third attempt to win the presidency. The disaster\r\nto Judge Parker had taught the party that victory did not lie in a\r\nconservative policy. With little difficulty, therefore, the veteran\r\nleader from Nebraska once more rallied the Democrats around his\r\nstandard, won the nomination, and wrote a platform vigorously attacking\r\nthe tariff, trusts, and monopolies. Supported by a loyal following, he\r\nentered the lists, only to meet another defeat. Though he polled almost\r\na million and a half more votes than did Judge Parker in 1904, the palm\r\nwent to Mr. Taft.\r\n\r\n=The Tariff Revision and Party Dissensions.=--At the very beginning of\r\nhis term, President Taft had to face the tariff issue. He had met it in\r\nthe campaign. Moved by the Democratic demand for a drastic reduction, he\r\nhad expressed opinions which were thought to imply a \"downward\r\nrevision.\" The Democrats made much of the implication and the\r\nRepublicans from the Middle West rejoiced in it. Pressure was coming\r\nfrom all sides. More than ten years had elapsed since the enactment of\r\nthe Dingley bill and the position of many industries had been altered\r\nwith the course of time. Evidently the day for revision--at best a\r\nthankless task--had arrived. Taft accepted the inevitable and called\r\nCongress in a special session. Until the midsummer of 1909, Republican\r\nSenators and Representatives wrangled over tariff schedules, the\r\nPresident making little effort to influence their decisions. When on\r\nAugust 5 the Payne-Aldrich bill became a law, a breach had been made in\r\nRepublican ranks. Powerful Senators from the Middle West had spoken\r\nangrily against many of the high rates imposed by the bill. They had\r\neven broken with their party colleagues to vote against the entire\r\nscheme of tariff revision.\r\n\r\n=The Income Tax Amendment.=--The rift in party harmony was widened by\r\nanother serious difference of opinion. During the debate on the tariff\r\nbill, there was a concerted movement to include in it an income tax\r\nprovision--this in spite of the decision of the Supreme Court in 1895\r\ndeclaring it unconstitutional. Conservative men were alarmed by the\r\nevident willingness of some members to flout a solemn decree of that\r\neminent tribunal. At the same time they saw a powerful combination of\r\nRepublicans and Democrats determined upon shifting some of the burden of\r\ntaxation to large incomes. In the press of circumstances, a compromise\r\nwas reached. The income tax bill was dropped for the present; but\r\nCongress passed the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, authorizing\r\ntaxes upon incomes from whatever source they might be derived, without\r\nreference to any apportionment among the states on the basis of\r\npopulation. The states ratified the amendment and early in 1913 it was\r\nproclaimed.\r\n\r\n=President Taft's Policies.=--After the enactment of the tariff bill,\r\nTaft continued to push forward with his legislative program. He\r\nrecommended, and Congress created, a special court of commerce with\r\njurisdiction, among other things, over appeals from the interstate\r\ncommerce commission, thus facilitating judicial review of the railway\r\nrates fixed and the orders issued by that body. This measure was quickly\r\nfollowed by an act establishing a system of postal savings banks in\r\nconnection with the post office--a scheme which had long been opposed by\r\nprivate banks. Two years later, Congress defied the lobby of the express\r\ncompanies and supplemented the savings banks with a parcels post system,\r\nthus enabling the American postal service to catch up with that of other\r\nprogressive nations. With a view to improving the business\r\nadministration of the federal government, the President obtained from\r\nCongress a large appropriation for an economy and efficiency commission\r\ncharged with the duty of inquiring into wasteful and obsolete methods\r\nand recommending improved devices and practices. The chief result of\r\nthis investigation was a vigorous report in favor of a national budget\r\nsystem, which soon found public backing.\r\n\r\nPresident Taft negotiated with England and France general treaties\r\nproviding for the arbitration of disputes which were \"justiciable\" in\r\ncharacter even though they might involve questions of \"vital interest\r\nand national honor.\" They were coldly received in the Senate and so\r\namended that Taft abandoned them altogether. A tariff reciprocity\r\nagreement with Canada, however, he forced through Congress in the face\r\nof strong opposition from his own party. After making a serious breach\r\nin Republican ranks, he was chagrined to see the whole scheme come to\r\nnaught by the overthrow of the Liberals in the Canadian elections of\r\n1911.\r\n\r\n=Prosecution of the Trusts.=--The party schism was even enlarged by what\r\nappeared to be the successful prosecution of several great combinations.\r\nIn two important cases, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of the\r\nStandard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company on the ground that\r\nthey violated the Sherman Anti-Trust law. In taking this step Chief\r\nJustice White was at some pains to state that the law did not apply to\r\ncombinations which did not \"unduly\" restrain trade. His remark,\r\nconstrued to mean that the Court would not interfere with corporations\r\nas such, became the subject of a popular outcry against the President\r\nand the judges.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESSIVE INSURGENCY AND THE ELECTION OF 1912\r\n\r\n=Growing Dissensions.=--All in all, Taft's administration from the first\r\nday had been disturbed by party discord. High words had passed over the\r\ntariff bill and disgruntled members of Congress could not forget them.\r\nTo differences over issues were added quarrels between youth and old\r\nage. In the House of Representatives there developed a group of young\r\n\"insurgent\" Republicans who resented the dominance of the Speaker,\r\nJoseph G. Cannon, and other members of the \"old guard,\" as they named\r\nthe men of long service and conservative minds. In 1910, the insurgents\r\nwent so far as to join with the Democrats in a movement to break the\r\nSpeaker's sway by ousting him from the rules committee and depriving him\r\nof the power to appoint its members. The storm was brewing. In the\r\nautumn of that year the Democrats won a clear majority in the House of\r\nRepresentatives and began an open battle with President Taft by\r\ndemanding an immediate downward revision of the tariff.\r\n\r\n=The Rise of the Progressive Republicans.=--Preparatory to the campaign\r\nof 1912, the dissenters within the Republican party added the prefix\r\n\"Progressive\" to their old title and began to organize a movement to\r\nprevent the renomination of Mr. Taft. As early as January 21, 1911, they\r\nformed a Progressive Republican League at the home of Senator La\r\nFollette of Wisconsin and launched an attack on the Taft measures and\r\npolicies. In October they indorsed Mr. La Follette as \"the logical\r\nRepublican candidate\" and appealed to the party for support. The\r\ncontroversy over the tariff had grown into a formidable revolt against\r\nthe occupant of the White House.\r\n\r\n=Roosevelt in the Field.=--After looking on for a while, ex-President\r\nRoosevelt took a hand in the fray. Soon after his return in 1910 from a\r\nhunting trip in Africa and a tour in Europe, he made a series of\r\naddresses in which he formulated a progressive program. In a speech in\r\nKansas, he favored regulation of the trusts, a graduated income tax\r\nbearing heavily on great fortunes, tariff revision schedule by schedule,\r\nconservation of natural resources, labor legislation, the direct\r\nprimary, and the recall of elective officials. In an address before the\r\nOhio state constitutional convention in February, 1912, he indorsed the\r\ninitiative and referendum and announced a doctrine known as the \"recall\r\nof judicial decisions.\" This was a new and radical note in American\r\npolitics. An ex-President of the United States proposed that the people\r\nat the polls should have the right to reverse the decision of a judge\r\nwho set aside any act of a state legislature passed in the interests of\r\nsocial welfare. The Progressive Republicans, impressed by these\r\naddresses, turned from La Follette to Roosevelt and on February 24,\r\ninduced him to come out openly as a candidate against Taft for the\r\nRepublican nomination.\r\n\r\n=The Split in the Republican Party.=--The country then witnessed the\r\nstrange spectacle of two men who had once been close companions engaged\r\nin a bitter rivalry to secure a majority of the delegates to the\r\nRepublican convention to be held at Chicago. When the convention\r\nassembled, about one-fourth of the seats were contested, the delegates\r\nfor both candidates loudly proclaiming the regularity of their election.\r\nIn deciding between the contestants the national committee, after the\r\nusual hearings, settled the disputes in such a way that Taft received a\r\nsafe majority. After a week of negotiation, Roosevelt and his followers\r\nleft the Republican party. Most of his supporters withdrew from the\r\nconvention and the few who remained behind refused to answer the roll\r\ncall. Undisturbed by this formidable bolt, the regular Republicans went\r\non with their work. They renominated Mr. Taft and put forth a platform\r\nroundly condemning such Progressive doctrines as the recall of judges.\r\n\r\n=The Formation of the Progressive Party.=--The action of the Republicans\r\nin seating the Taft delegates was vigorously denounced by Roosevelt. He\r\ndeclared that the convention had no claim to represent the voters of the\r\nRepublican party; that any candidate named by it would be \"the\r\nbeneficiary of a successful fraud\"; and that it would be deeply\r\ndiscreditable to any man to accept the convention's approval under such\r\ncircumstances. The bitterness of his followers was extreme. On July 8, a\r\ncall went forth for a \"Progressive\" convention to be held in Chicago on\r\nAugust 5. The assembly which duly met on that day was a unique political\r\nconference. Prominence was given to women delegates, and \"politicians\"\r\nwere notably absent. Roosevelt himself, who was cheered as a conquering\r\nhero, made an impassioned speech setting forth his \"confession of\r\nfaith.\" He was nominated by acclamation; Governor Hiram Johnson of\r\nCalifornia was selected as his companion candidate for Vice President.\r\nThe platform endorsed such political reforms as woman suffrage, direct\r\nprimaries, the initiative, referendum, and recall, popular election of\r\nUnited States Senators, and the short ballot. It favored a program of\r\nsocial legislation, including the prohibition of child labor and minimum\r\nwages for women. It approved the regulation, rather than the\r\ndissolution, of the trusts. Like apostles in a new and lofty cause, the\r\nProgressives entered a vigorous campaign for the election of their\r\ndistinguished leader.\r\n\r\n=Woodrow Wilson and the Election of 1912.=--With the Republicans\r\ndivided, victory loomed up before the Democrats. Naturally, a terrific\r\ncontest over the nomination occurred at their convention in Baltimore.\r\nChamp Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Governor\r\nWoodrow Wilson, of New Jersey, were the chief contestants. After tossing\r\nto and fro for seven long, hot days, and taking forty-six ballots, the\r\ndelegates, powerfully influenced by Mr. Bryan, finally decided in favor\r\nof the governor. As a professor, a writer on historical and political\r\nsubjects, and the president of Princeton University, Mr. Wilson had\r\nbecome widely known in public life. As the governor of New Jersey he had\r\nattracted the support of the progressives in both parties. With grim\r\ndetermination he had \"waged war on the bosses,\" and pushed through the\r\nlegislature measures establishing direct primaries, regulating public\r\nutilities, and creating a system of workmen's compensation in\r\nindustries. During the presidential campaign that followed Governor\r\nWilson toured the country and aroused great enthusiasm by a series of\r\naddresses later published under the title of _The New Freedom_. He\r\ndeclared that \"the government of the United States is at present the\r\nfoster child of the special interests.\" He proposed to free the country\r\nby breaking the dominance of \"the big bankers, the big manufacturers,\r\nthe big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad corporations and of\r\nsteamship corporations.\"\r\n\r\nIn the election Governor Wilson easily secured a majority of the\r\nelectoral votes, and his party, while retaining possession of the House\r\nof Representatives, captured the Senate as well. The popular verdict,\r\nhowever, indicated a state of confusion in the country. The combined\r\nProgressive and Republican vote exceeded that of the Democrats by\r\n1,300,000. The Socialists, with Eugene V. Debs as their candidate again,\r\npolled about 900,000 votes, more than double the number received four\r\nyears before. Thus, as the result of an extraordinary upheaval the\r\nRepublicans, after holding the office of President for sixteen years,\r\npassed out of power, and the government of the country was intrusted to\r\nthe Democrats under the leadership of a man destined to be one of the\r\noutstanding figures of the modern age, Woodrow Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General References=\r\n\r\nJ.B.

It had been\r\nlong in preparation. The revolt against corruption in politics which\r\nproduced the Liberal Republican outbreak in the seventies and the\r\nMugwump movement of the eighties was followed by continuous criticism of\r\nAmerican political and economic development. From 1880 until his death\r\nin 1892, George William Curtis, as president of the Civil Service Reform\r\nAssociation, kept up a running fire upon the abuses of the spoils\r\nsystem. James Bryce, an observant English scholar and man of affairs, in\r\nhis great work, _The American Commonwealth_, published in 1888, by\r\npicturing fearlessly the political rings and machines which dominated\r\nthe cities, gave the whole country a fresh shock. Six years later Henry\r\nD. Lloyd, in a powerful book entitled _Wealth against Commonwealth_,\r\nattacked in scathing language certain trusts which had destroyed their\r\nrivals and bribed public officials. In 1903 Miss Ida Tarbell, an author\r\nof established reputation in the historical field, gave to the public an\r\naccount of the Standard Oil Company, revealing the ruthless methods of\r\nthat corporation in crushing competition. About the same time Lincoln\r\nSteffens exposed the sordid character of politics in several\r\nmunicipalities in a series of articles bearing the painful heading: _The\r\nShame of the Cities_. The critical spirit appeared in almost every form;\r\nin weekly and monthly magazines, in essays and pamphlets, in editorials\r\nand news stories, in novels like Churchill's _Coniston_ and Sinclair's\r\n_The Jungle_. It became so savage and so wanton that the opening years\r\nof the twentieth century were well named \"the age of the muckrakers.\"\r\n\r\n=The Subjects of the Criticism.=--In this outburst of invective, nothing\r\nwas spared. It was charged that each of the political parties had fallen\r\ninto the hands of professional politicians who devoted their time to\r\nmanaging conventions, making platforms, nominating candidates, and\r\ndictating to officials; in return for their \"services\" they sold offices\r\nand privileges. It was alleged that mayors and councils had bargained\r\naway for private benefit street railway and other franchises. It was\r\nasserted that many powerful labor unions were dominated by men who\r\nblackmailed employers. Some critics specialized in descriptions of the\r\npoverty, slums, and misery of great cities. Others took up \"frenzied\r\nfinance\" and accused financiers of selling worthless stocks and bonds to\r\nan innocent public. Still others professed to see in the accumulations\r\nof millionaires the downfall of our republic.\r\n\r\n=The Attack on \"Invisible Government.\"=--Some even maintained that the\r\ncontrol of public affairs had passed from the people to a sinister\r\nminority called \"the invisible government.\" So eminent and conservative\r\na statesman as the Hon. Elihu Root lent the weight of his great name to\r\nsuch an imputation. Speaking of his native state, New York, he said:\r\n\"What is the government of this state? What has it been during the forty\r\nyears of my acquaintance with it? The government of the Constitution?\r\nOh, no; not half the time or half way.... From the days of Fenton and\r\nConkling and Arthur and Cornell and Platt, from the days of David B.\r\nHill down to the present time, the government of the state has presented\r\ntwo different lines of activity: one, of the constitutional and\r\nstatutory officers of the state and the other of the party leaders; they\r\ncall them party bosses. They call the system--I don't coin the\r\nphrase--the system they call 'invisible government.' For I don't know\r\nhow many years Mr. Conkling was the supreme ruler in this state. The\r\ngovernor did not count, the legislature did not count, comptrollers and\r\nsecretaries of state and what not did not count. It was what Mr.\r\nConkling said, and in a great outburst of public rage he was pulled\r\ndown. Then Mr. Platt ruled the state; for nigh upon twenty years he\r\nruled it. It was not the governor; it was not the legislature; it was\r\nMr. Platt. And the capital was not here [in Albany]; it was at 49\r\nBroadway; Mr. Platt and his lieutenants. It makes no difference what\r\nname you give, whether you call it Fenton or Conkling or Cornell or\r\nArthur or Platt or by the names of men now living. The ruler of the\r\nstate during the greater part of the forty years of my acquaintance with\r\nthe state government has not been any man authorized by the constitution\r\nor by law.... The party leader is elected by no one, accountable to no\r\none, bound by no oath of office, removable by no one.\"\r\n\r\n=The Nation Aroused.=--With the spirit of criticism came also the spirit\r\nof reform. The charges were usually exaggerated; often wholly false; but\r\nthere was enough truth in them to warrant renewed vigilance on the part\r\nof American democracy. President Roosevelt doubtless summed up the\r\nsentiment of the great majority of citizens when he demanded the\r\npunishment of wrong-doers in 1907, saying: \"It makes not a particle of\r\ndifference whether these crimes are committed by a capitalist or by a\r\nlaborer, by a leading banker or manufacturer or railroad man or by a\r\nleading representative of a labor union. Swindling in stocks, corrupting\r\nlegislatures, making fortunes by the inflation of securities, by\r\nwrecking railroads, by destroying competitors through rebates--these\r\nforms of wrong-doing in the capitalist are far more infamous than any\r\nordinary form of embezzlement or forgery.\" The time had come, he added,\r\nto stop \"muckraking\" and proceed to the constructive work of removing\r\nthe abuses that had grown up.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL REFORMS\r\n\r\n=The Public Service.=--It was a wise comprehension of the needs of\r\nAmerican democracy that led the friends of reform to launch and to\r\nsustain for more than half a century a movement to improve the public\r\nservice. On the one side they struck at the spoils system; at the right\r\nof the politicians to use public offices as mere rewards for partisan\r\nwork. The federal civil service act of 1883 opened the way to reform by\r\nestablishing five vital principles in law: (1) admission to office, not\r\non the recommendation of party workers, but on the basis of competitive\r\nexaminations; (2) promotion for meritorious service of the government\r\nrather than of parties; (3) no assessment of office holders for campaign\r\nfunds; (4) permanent tenure during good behavior; and (5) no dismissals\r\nfor political reasons. The act itself at first applied to only 14,000\r\nfederal offices, but under the constant pressure from the reformers it\r\nwas extended until in 1916 it covered nearly 300,000 employees out of an\r\nexecutive force of approximately 414,000. While gaining steadily at\r\nWashington, civil service reformers carried their agitation into the\r\nstates and cities. By 1920 they were able to report ten states with\r\ncivil service commissions and the merit system well intrenched in more\r\nthan three hundred municipalities.\r\n\r\nIn excluding spoilsmen from public office, the reformers were, in a\r\nsense, engaged in a negative work: that of \"keeping the rascals out.\"\r\nBut there was a second and larger phase to their movement, one\r\nconstructive in character: that of getting skilled, loyal, and efficient\r\nservants into the places of responsibility. Everywhere on land and sea,\r\nin town and country, new burdens were laid upon public officers. They\r\nwere called upon to supervise the ships sailing to and from our ports;\r\nto inspect the water and milk supplies of our cities; to construct and\r\noperate great public works, such as the Panama and Erie canals; to\r\nregulate the complicated rates of railway companies; to safeguard health\r\nand safety in a thousand ways; to climb the mountains to fight forest\r\nfires; and to descend into the deeps of the earth to combat the deadly\r\ncoal gases that assail the miners. In a word, those who labored to\r\nmaster the secrets and the powers of nature were summoned to the aid of\r\nthe government: chemists, engineers, architects, nurses, surgeons,\r\nforesters--the skilled in all the sciences, arts, and crafts.\r\n\r\nKeeping rascals out was no task at all compared with the problem of\r\nfinding competent people for all the technical offices. \"Now,\" said the\r\nreformers, \"we must make attractive careers in the government work for\r\nthe best American talent; we must train those applying for admission and\r\nincrease the skill of those already in positions of trust; we must see\r\nto it that those entering at the bottom have a chance to rise to the\r\ntop; in short, we must work for a government as skilled and efficient as\r\nit is strong, one commanding all the wisdom and talent of America that\r\npublic welfare requires.\"\r\n\r\n=The Australian Ballot.=--A second line of attack on the political\r\nmachines was made in connection with the ballot. In the early days\r\nelections were frequently held in the open air and the poll was taken by\r\na show of hands or by the enrollment of the voters under names of their\r\nfavorite candidates. When this ancient practice was abandoned in favor\r\nof the printed ballot, there was still no secrecy about elections. Each\r\nparty prepared its own ballot, often of a distinctive color, containing\r\nthe names of its candidates. On election day, these papers were handed\r\nout to the voters by party workers. Any one could tell from the color of\r\nthe ballot dropped into the box, or from some mark on the outside of the\r\nfolded ballot, just how each man voted. Those who bought votes were sure\r\nthat their purchases were \"delivered.\" Those who intimidated voters\r\ncould know when their intimidation was effective. In this way the party\r\nballot strengthened the party machine.\r\n\r\nAs a remedy for such abuses, reformers, learning from the experience of\r\nAustralia, urged the adoption of the \"Australian ballot.\" That ballot,\r\nthough it appeared in many forms, had certain constant features. It was\r\nofficial, that is, furnished by the government, not by party workers; it\r\ncontained the names of all candidates of all parties; it was given out\r\nonly in the polling places; and it was marked in secret. The first state\r\nto introduce it was Massachusetts. The year was 1888. Before the end of\r\nthe century it had been adopted by nearly all the states in the union.\r\nThe salutary effect of the reform in reducing the amount of cheating\r\nand bribery in elections was beyond all question.\r\n\r\n=The Direct Primary.=--In connection with the uprising against machine\r\npolitics, came a call for the abolition of the old method of nominating\r\ncandidates by conventions. These time-honored party assemblies, which\r\nhad come down from the days of Andrew Jackson, were, it was said, merely\r\nconclaves of party workers, sustained by the spoils system, and\r\ndominated by an inner circle of bosses. The remedy offered in this case\r\nwas again \"more democracy,\" namely, the abolition of the party\r\nconvention and the adoption of the direct primary. Candidates were no\r\nlonger to be chosen by secret conferences. Any member of a party was to\r\nbe allowed to run for any office, to present his name to his party by\r\nsecuring signatures to a petition, and to submit his candidacy to his\r\nfellow partisans at a direct primary--an election within the party. In\r\nthis movement Governor La Follette of Wisconsin took the lead and his\r\nstate was the first in the union to adopt the direct primary for\r\nstate-wide purposes. The idea spread, rapidly in the West, more slowly\r\nin the East. The public, already angered against \"the bosses,\" grasped\r\neagerly at it. Governor Hughes in New York pressed it upon the unwilling\r\nlegislature. State after state accepted it until by 1918 Rhode Island,\r\nDelaware, Connecticut, and New Mexico were the only states that had not\r\nbowed to the storm. Still the results were disappointing and at that\r\nvery time the pendulum was beginning to swing backward.\r\n\r\n=Popular Election of Federal Senators.=--While the movement for direct\r\nprimaries was still advancing everywhere, a demand for the popular\r\nelection of Senators, usually associated with it, swept forward to\r\nvictory. Under the original Constitution, it had been expressly provided\r\nthat Senators should be chosen by the legislatures of the states. In\r\npractice this rule transferred the selection of Senators to secret\r\ncaucuses of party members in the state legislatures. In connection with\r\nthese caucuses there had been many scandals, some direct proofs of\r\nbrazen bribery and corruption, and dark hints besides. The Senate was\r\ncalled by its detractors \"a millionaires' club\" and it was looked upon\r\nas the \"citadel of conservatism.\" The prescription in this case was\r\nlikewise \"more democracy\"--direct election of Senators by popular vote.\r\n\r\nThis reform was not a new idea. It had been proposed in Congress as\r\nearly as 1826. President Johnson, an ardent advocate, made it the\r\nsubject of a special message in 1868 Not long afterward it appeared in\r\nCongress. At last in 1893, the year after the great Populist upheaval,\r\nthe House of Representatives by the requisite two-thirds vote\r\nincorporated it in an amendment to the federal Constitution. Again and\r\nagain it passed the House; but the Senate itself was obdurate. Able\r\nSenators leveled their batteries against it. Mr. Hoar of Massachusetts\r\ndeclared that it would transfer the seat of power to the \"great cities\r\nand masses of population\"; that it would \"overthrow the whole scheme of\r\nthe Senate and in the end the whole scheme of the national Constitution\r\nas designed and established by the framers of the Constitution and the\r\npeople who adopted it.\"\r\n\r\nFailing in the Senate, advocates of popular election made a rear assault\r\nthrough the states. They induced state legislatures to enact laws\r\nrequiring the nomination of candidates for the Senate by the direct\r\nprimary, and then they bound the legislatures to abide by the popular\r\nchoice. Nevada took the lead in 1899. Shortly afterward Oregon, by the\r\nuse of the initiative and referendum, practically bound legislators to\r\naccept the popular nominee and the country witnessed the spectacle of a\r\nRepublican legislature \"electing\" a Democrat to represent the state in\r\nthe Senate at Washington. By 1910 three-fourths of the states had\r\napplied the direct primary in some form to the choice of Senators. Men\r\nselected by that method began to pour in upon the floors of Congress;\r\nfinally in 1912 the two-thirds majority was secured for an amendment to\r\nthe federal Constitution providing for the popular election of Senators.\r\nIt was quickly ratified by the states. The following year it was\r\nproclaimed in effect.\r\n\r\n=The Initiative and Referendum.=--As a corrective for the evils which\r\nhad grown up in state legislatures there arose a demand for the\r\nintroduction of a Swiss device known as the initiative and referendum.\r\nThe initiative permits any one to draw up a proposed bill; and, on\r\nsecuring a certain number of signatures among the voters, to require the\r\nsubmission of the measure to the people at an election. If the bill thus\r\ninitiated receives a sufficient majority, it becomes a law. The\r\nreferendum allows citizens who disapprove any act passed by the\r\nlegislature to get up a petition against it and thus bring about a\r\nreference of the measure to the voters at the polls for approval or\r\nrejection. These two practices constitute a form of \"direct government.\"\r\n\r\nThese devices were prescribed \"to restore the government to the people.\"\r\nThe Populists favored them in their platform of 1896. Mr. Bryan, two\r\nyears later, made them a part of his program, and in the same year South\r\nDakota adopted them. In 1902 Oregon, after a strenuous campaign, added a\r\ndirect legislation amendment to the state constitution. Within ten years\r\nall the Southwestern, Mountain, and Pacific states, except Texas and\r\nWyoming, had followed this example. To the east of the Mississippi,\r\nhowever, direct legislation met a chilly reception. By 1920 only five\r\nstates in this section had accepted it: Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio,\r\nMichigan, and Maryland, the last approving the referendum only.\r\n\r\n=The Recall.=--Executive officers and judges, as well as legislatures,\r\nhad come in for their share of criticism, and it was proposed that they\r\nshould likewise be subjected to a closer scrutiny by the public. For\r\nthis purpose there was advanced a scheme known as the recall--which\r\npermitted a certain percentage of the voters to compel any officer, at\r\nany time during his term, to go before the people at a new election.\r\nThis feature of direct government, tried out first in the city of Los\r\nAngeles, was extended to state-wide uses in Oregon in 1908. It failed,\r\nhowever, to capture popular imagination to the same degree as the\r\ninitiative and referendum. At the end of ten years' agitation, only ten\r\nstates, mainly in the West, had adopted it for general purposes, and\r\nfour of them did not apply it to the judges of the courts. Still it was\r\nextensively acclaimed in cities and incorporated into hundreds of\r\nmunicipal laws and charters.\r\n\r\nAs a general proposition, direct government in all its forms was\r\nbitterly opposed by men of a conservative cast of mind. It was denounced\r\nby Senator Henry Cabot Lodge as \"nothing less than a complete revolution\r\nin the fabric of our government and in the fundamental principles upon\r\nwhich that government rests.\" In his opinion, it promised to break down\r\nthe representative principle and \"undermine and overthrow the bulwarks\r\nof ordered liberty and individual freedom.\" Mr. Taft shared Mr. Lodge's\r\nviews and spoke of direct government with scorn. \"Votes,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"are not bread ... referendums do not pay rent or furnish houses,\r\nrecalls do not furnish clothes, initiatives do not supply employment or\r\nrelieve inequalities of condition or of opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n=Commission Government for Cities.=--In the restless searching out of\r\nevils, the management of cities early came under critical scrutiny. City\r\ngovernment, Mr. Bryce had remarked, was the one conspicuous failure in\r\nAmerica. This sharp thrust, though resented by some, was accepted as a\r\nwarning by others. Many prescriptions were offered by doctors of the\r\nbody politic. Chief among them was the idea of simplifying the city\r\ngovernment so that the light of public scrutiny could shine through it.\r\n\"Let us elect only a few men and make them clearly responsible for the\r\ncity government!\" was the new cry in municipal reform. So, many city\r\ncouncils were reduced in size; one of the two houses, which several\r\ncities had adopted in imitation of the federal government, was\r\nabolished; and in order that the mayor could be held to account, he was\r\ngiven the power to appoint all the chief officials. This made the mayor,\r\nin some cases, the only elective city official and gave the voters a\r\n\"short ballot\" containing only a few names--an idea which some proposed\r\nto apply also to the state government.\r\n\r\nA further step in the concentration of authority was taken in Galveston,\r\nTexas, where the people, looking upon the ruin of their city wrought by\r\nthe devastating storm of 1901, and confronted by the difficult problems\r\nof reconstruction, felt the necessity for a more businesslike management\r\nof city affairs and instituted a new form of local administration. They\r\nabolished the old scheme of mayor and council and vested all power in\r\nfive commissioners, one of whom, without any special prerogatives, was\r\nassigned to the office of \"mayor president.\" In 1908, the commission\r\nform of government, as it was soon characterized, was adopted by Des\r\nMoines, Iowa. The attention of all municipal reformers was drawn to it\r\nand it was hailed as the guarantee of a better day. By 1920, more than\r\nfour hundred cities, including Memphis, Spokane, Birmingham, Newark, and\r\nBuffalo, had adopted it. Still the larger cities like New York and\r\nChicago kept their boards of aldermen.\r\n\r\n=The City Manager Plan.=--A few years' experience with commission\r\ngovernment revealed certain patent defects. The division of the work\r\namong five men was frequently found to introduce dissensions and\r\nirresponsibility. Commissioners were often lacking in the technical\r\nability required to manage such difficult matters as fire and police\r\nprotection, public health, public works, and public utilities. Some one\r\nthen proposed to carry over into city government an idea from the\r\nbusiness world. In that sphere the stockholders of each corporation\r\nelect the directors and the directors, in turn, choose a business\r\nmanager to conduct the affairs of the company. It was suggested that the\r\ncity commissioners, instead of attempting to supervise the details of\r\nthe city administration, should select a manager to do this. The scheme\r\nwas put into effect in Sumter, South Carolina, in 1912. Like the\r\ncommission plan, it became popular. Within eight years more than one\r\nhundred and fifty towns and cities had adopted it. Among the larger\r\nmunicipalities were Dayton, Springfield (Ohio), Akron, Kalamazoo, and\r\nPhoenix. It promised to create a new public service profession, that of\r\ncity manager.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURES OF ECONOMIC REFORM\r\n\r\n=The Spirit of American Reform.=--The purification of the ballot, the\r\nrestriction of the spoils system, the enlargement of direct popular\r\ncontrol over the organs of government were not the sole answers made by\r\nthe reformers to the critics of American institutions. Nor were they the\r\nmost important. In fact, they were regarded not as ends in themselves,\r\nbut as means to serve a wider purpose. That purpose was the promotion of\r\nthe \"general welfare.\" The concrete objects covered by that broad term\r\nwere many and varied; but they included the prevention of extortion by\r\nrailway and other corporations, the protection of public health, the\r\nextension of education, the improvement of living conditions in the\r\ncities, the elimination of undeserved poverty, the removal of gross\r\ninequalities in wealth, and more equality of opportunity.\r\n\r\nAll these things involved the use of the powers of government. Although\r\na few clung to the ancient doctrine that the government should not\r\ninterfere with private business at all, the American people at large\r\nrejected that theory as vigorously as they rejected the doctrines of an\r\nextreme socialism which exalts the state above the individual. Leaders\r\nrepresenting every shade of opinion proclaimed the government an\r\ninstrument of common welfare to be used in the public interest. \"We must\r\nabandon definitely,\" said Roosevelt, \"the _laissez-faire_ theory of\r\npolitical economy and fearlessly champion a system of increased\r\ngovernmental control, paying no attention to the cries of worthy people\r\nwho denounce this as socialistic.\" This view was shared by Mr. Taft, who\r\nobserved: \"Undoubtedly the government can wisely do much more ... to\r\nrelieve the oppressed, to create greater equality of opportunity, to\r\nmake reasonable terms for labor in employment, and to furnish vocational\r\neducation.\" He was quick to add his caution that \"there is a line beyond\r\nwhich the government cannot go with any good practical results in\r\nseeking to make men and society better.\"\r\n\r\n=The Regulation of Railways.=--The first attempts to use the government\r\nin a large way to control private enterprise in the public interest were\r\nmade by the Northwestern states in the decade between 1870 and 1880.\r\nCharges were advanced by the farmers, particularly those organized into\r\nGranges, that the railways extorted the highest possible rates for\r\nfreight and passengers, that favoritism was shown to large shippers,\r\nthat fraudulent stocks and bonds were sold to the innocent public. It\r\nwas claimed that railways were not like other enterprises, but were\r\n\"quasi-public\" concerns, like the roads and ferries, and thus subject to\r\ngovernment control. Accordingly laws were enacted bringing the railroads\r\nunder state supervision. In some cases the state legislature fixed the\r\nmaximum rates to be charged by common carriers, and in other cases\r\ncommissions were created with the power to establish the rates after an\r\ninvestigation. This legislation was at first denounced in the East as\r\nnothing less than the \"confiscation\" of the railways in the interest of\r\nthe farmers. Attempts to have the Supreme Court of the United States\r\ndeclare it unconstitutional were made without avail; still a principle\r\nwas finally laid down to the effect that in fixing rates state\r\nlegislatures and commissions must permit railway companies to earn a\r\n\"fair\" return on the capital invested.\r\n\r\nIn a few years the Granger spirit appeared in Congress. An investigation\r\nrevealed a long list of abuses committed by the railways against\r\nshippers and travelers. The result was the interstate commerce act of\r\n1887, which created the Interstate Commerce Commission, forbade\r\ndiscriminations in rates, and prohibited other objectionable practices\r\non the part of railways. This measure was loosely enforced and the\r\nabuses against which it was directed continued almost unabated. A demand\r\nfor stricter control grew louder and louder. Congress was forced to\r\nheed. In 1903 it enacted the Elkins law, forbidding railways to charge\r\nrates other than those published, and laid penalties upon the officers\r\nand agents of companies, who granted secret favors to shippers, and upon\r\nshippers who accepted them. Three years later a still more drastic step\r\nwas taken by the passage of the Hepburn act. The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission was authorized, upon complaint of some party aggrieved, and\r\nafter a public hearing, to determine whether just and reasonable rates\r\nhad been charged by the companies. In effect, the right to fix freight\r\nand passenger rates was taken out of the hands of the owners of the\r\nrailways engaged in interstate commerce and vested in the hands of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. Thus private property to the value of\r\n$20,000,000,000 or more was declared to be a matter of public concern\r\nand subject to government regulation in the common interest.\r\n\r\n=Municipal Utilities.=--Similar problems arose in connection with the\r\nstreet railways, electric light plants, and other utilities in the great\r\ncities. In the beginning the right to construct such undertakings was\r\nfreely, and often corruptly, granted to private companies by city\r\ncouncils. Distressing abuses arose in connection with such practices.\r\nMany grants or franchises were made perpetual, or perhaps for a term of\r\n999 years. The rates charged and services rendered were left largely to\r\nthe will of the companies holding the franchises. Mergers or unions of\r\ncompanies were common and the public was deluged with stocks and bonds\r\nof doubtful value; bankruptcies were frequent. The connection between\r\nthe utility companies and the politicians was, to say the least, not\r\nalways in the public interest.\r\n\r\nAmerican ingenuity was quick to devise methods for eliminating such\r\nevils. Three lines of progress were laid out by the reformers. One group\r\nproposed that such utilities should be subject to municipal or state\r\nregulation, that the formation of utility companies should be under\r\npublic control, and that the issue of stocks and bonds must be approved\r\nby public authority. In some cases state, and in other cases municipal,\r\ncommissions were created to exercise this great power over \"quasi-public\r\ncorporations.\" Wisconsin, by laws enacted in 1907, put all heat, light,\r\nwater works, telephone, and street railway companies under the\r\nsupervision of a single railway commission. Other states followed this\r\nexample rapidly. By 1920 the principle of public control over municipal\r\nutilities was accepted in nearly every section of the union.\r\n\r\nA second line of reform appeared in the \"model franchise\" for utility\r\ncorporations. An illustration of this tendency was afforded by the\r\nChicago street railway settlement of 1906. The total capital of the\r\ncompany was fixed at a definite sum, its earnings were agreed upon, and\r\nthe city was given the right to buy and operate the system if it desired\r\nto do so. In many states, about the same time, it was provided that no\r\nfranchises to utility companies could run more than twenty-five years.\r\n\r\nA third group of reformers were satisfied with nothing short of\r\nmunicipal ownership. They proposed to drive private companies entirely\r\nout of the field and vest the ownership and management of municipal\r\nplants in the city itself. This idea was extensively applied to electric\r\nlight and water works plants, but to street railways in only a few\r\ncities, including San Francisco and Seattle. In New York the subways are\r\nowned by the city but leased for operation.\r\n\r\n=Tenement House Control.=--Among the other pressing problems of the\r\ncities was the overcrowding in houses unfit for habitation. An inquiry\r\nin New York City made under the authority of the state in 1902 revealed\r\npoverty, misery, slums, dirt, and disease almost beyond imagination. The\r\nimmediate answer was the enactment of a tenement house law prescribing\r\nin great detail the size of the rooms, the air space, the light and the\r\nsanitary arrangement for all new buildings. An immense improvement\r\nfollowed and the idea was quickly taken up in other states having large\r\nindustrial centers. In 1920 New York made a further invasion of the\r\nrights of landlords by assuring to the public \"reasonable rents\" for\r\nflats and apartments.\r\n\r\n=Workmen's Compensation.=--No small part of the poverty in cities was\r\ndue to the injury of wage-earners while at their trade. Every year the\r\nnumber of men and women killed or wounded in industry mounted higher.\r\nUnder the old law, the workman or his family had to bear the loss unless\r\nthe employer had been guilty of some extraordinary negligence. Even in\r\nthat case an expensive lawsuit was usually necessary to recover\r\n\"damages.\" In short, although employers insured their buildings and\r\nmachinery against necessary risks from fire and storm, they allowed\r\ntheir employees to assume the heavy losses due to accidents. The\r\ninjustice of this, though apparent enough now, was once not generally\r\nrecognized. It was said to be unfair to make the employer pay for\r\ninjuries for which he was not personally responsible; but the argument\r\nwas overborne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EAST SIDE STREET IN NEW YORK]\r\n\r\nAbout 1910 there set in a decided movement in the direction of lifting\r\nthe burden of accidents from the unfortunate victims. In the first\r\nplace, laws were enacted requiring employers to pay damages in certain\r\namounts according to the nature of the case, no matter how the accident\r\noccurred, as long as the injured person was not guilty of willful\r\nnegligence. By 1914 more than one-half the states had such laws. In the\r\nsecond place, there developed schemes of industrial insurance in the\r\nform of automatic grants made by state commissions to persons injured in\r\nindustries, the funds to be provided by the employers or the state or by\r\nboth. By 1917 thirty-six states had legislation of this type.\r\n\r\n=Minimum Wages and Mothers' Pensions.=--Another source of poverty,\r\nespecially among women and children, was found to be the low wages paid\r\nfor their labor. Report after report showed this. In 1912 Massachusetts\r\ntook a significant step in the direction of declaring the minimum wages\r\nwhich might be paid to women and children. Oregon, the following year,\r\ncreated a commission with power to prescribe minimum wages in certain\r\nindustries, based on the cost of living, and to enforce the rates fixed.\r\nWithin a short time one-third of the states had legislation of this\r\ncharacter. To cut away some of the evils of poverty and enable widows to\r\nkeep their homes intact and bring up their children, a device known as\r\nmothers' pensions became popular during the second decade of the\r\ntwentieth century. At the opening of 1913 two states, Colorado and\r\nIllinois, had laws authorizing the payment from public funds of definite\r\nsums to widows with children. Within four years, thirty-five states had\r\nsimilar legislation.\r\n\r\n=Taxation and Great Fortunes.=--As a part of the campaign waged against\r\npoverty by reformers there came a demand for heavy taxes upon great\r\nfortunes, particularly taxes upon inheritances or estates passing to\r\nheirs on the decease of the owners. Roosevelt was an ardent champion of\r\nthis type of taxation and dwelt upon it at length in his message to\r\nCongress in 1907. \"Such a tax,\" he said, \"would help to preserve a\r\nmeasurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations\r\ngrowing to manhood.... Our aim is to recognize what Lincoln pointed out:\r\nthe fact that there are some respects in which men are obviously not\r\nequal; but also to insist that there should be equality of self-respect\r\nand of mutual respect, an equality of rights before the law, and at\r\nleast an approximate equality in the conditions under which each man\r\nobtains the chance to show the stuff that is in him when compared with\r\nhis fellows.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the new age was, therefore, one of reform, not of\r\nrevolution. It called for no evolutionary or utopian experiments, but\r\nfor the steady and progressive enactment of measures aimed at admitted\r\nabuses and designed to accomplish tangible results in the name of public\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General References=\r\n\r\nJ.

Where they did not\r\nlead, they were affiliated with movements for social improvement. No\r\ncause escaped their attention; no year passed without widening the range\r\nof their interests. They served on committees that inquired into the\r\nproblems of the day; they appeared before legislative assemblies to\r\nadvocate remedies for the evils they discovered. By 1912 they were a\r\nforce to be reckoned with in national politics. In nine states complete\r\nand equal suffrage had been established, and a widespread campaign for a\r\nnational suffrage amendment was in full swing. On every hand lay\r\nevidences that their sphere had been broadened to include public\r\naffairs. This was the culmination of forces that had long been\r\noperating.\r\n\r\n=A New Emphasis in History.=--A movement so deeply affecting important\r\ninterests could not fail to find a place in time in the written record\r\nof human progress. History often began as a chronicle of kings and\r\nqueens, knights and ladies, written partly to amuse and partly to\r\ninstruct the classes that appeared in its pages. With the growth of\r\ncommerce, parliaments, and international relations, politics and\r\ndiplomacy were added to such chronicles of royal and princely doings.\r\nAfter the rise of democracy, industry, and organized labor, the\r\ntransactions of everyday life were deemed worthy of a place in the pages\r\nof history. In each case history was rewritten and the past rediscovered\r\nin the light of the new age. So it will be with the rise and growth of\r\nwomen's political power. The history of their labor, their education,\r\ntheir status in society, their influence on the course of events will be\r\nexplored and given its place in the general record.\r\n\r\nIt will be a history of change. The superior position which women enjoy\r\nin America to-day is the result of a slow evolution from an almost\r\nrightless condition in colonial times. The founders of America brought\r\nwith them the English common law. Under that law, a married woman's\r\npersonal property--jewels, money, furniture, and the like--became her\r\nhusband's property; the management of her lands passed into his control.\r\nEven the wages she earned, if she worked for some one else, belonged to\r\nhim. Custom, if not law, prescribed that women should not take part in\r\ntown meetings or enter into public discussions of religious questions.\r\nIndeed it is a far cry from the banishment of Anne Hutchinson from\r\nMassachusetts in 1637, for daring to dispute with the church fathers, to\r\nthe political conventions of 1920 in which women sat as delegates, made\r\nnominating speeches, and served on committees. In the contrast between\r\nthese two scenes may be measured the change in the privileges of women\r\nsince the landing of the Pilgrims. The account of this progress is a\r\nnarrative of individual effort on the part of women, of organizations\r\namong them, of generous aid from sympathetic men in the long agitation\r\nfor the removal of civil and political disabilities. It is in part also\r\na narrative of irresistible economic change which drew women into\r\nindustry, created a leisure class, gave women wages and incomes, and\r\ntherewith economic independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF THE WOMAN MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n=Protests of Colonial Women.=--The republican spirit which produced\r\nAmerican independence was of slow and steady growth. It did not spring\r\nup full-armed in a single night. It was, on the contrary, nourished\r\nduring a long period of time by fireside discussions as well as by\r\ndebates in the public forum. Women shared that fireside sifting of\r\npolitical principles and passed on the findings of that scrutiny in\r\nletters to their friends, newspaper articles, and every form of written\r\nword. How widespread was this potent, though not spectacular force, is\r\nrevealed in the collections of women's letters, articles, songs, dramas,\r\nand satirical \"skits\" on English rule that have come down to us. In this\r\nsearch into the reasons of government, some women began to take thought\r\nabout laws that excluded them from the ballot. Two women at least left\r\ntheir protests on record. Abigail, the ingenious and witty wife of John\r\nAdams, wrote to her husband, in March, 1776, that women objected \"to all\r\narbitrary power whether of state or males\" and demanded political\r\nprivileges in the new order then being created. Hannah Lee Corbin, the\r\nsister of \"Lighthorse\" Harry Lee, protested to her brother against the\r\ntaxation of women without representation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABIGAIL ADAMS]\r\n\r\n=The Stir among European Women.=--Ferment in America, in the case of\r\nwomen as of men, was quickened by events in Europe. In 1792, Mary\r\nWollstonecraft published in England the _Vindication of the Rights of\r\nWomen_--a book that was destined to serve the cause of liberty among\r\nwomen as the writings of Locke and Paine had served that of men. The\r\nspecific grievances which stirred English women were men's invasion of\r\nwomen's industries, such as spinning and weaving; the denial of equal\r\neducational opportunities; and political disabilities. In France also\r\nthe great Revolution raised questionings about the status of women. The\r\nrights of \"citizenesses\" as well as the rights of \"citizens\" were\r\nexamined by the boldest thinkers. This in turn reacted upon women in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n=Leadership in America.=--The origins of the American woman movement are\r\nto be found in the writings of a few early intellectual leaders. During\r\nthe first decades of the nineteenth century, books, articles, and\r\npamphlets about women came in increasing numbers from the press. Lydia\r\nMaria Child wrote a history of women; Margaret Fuller made a critical\r\nexamination of the status of women in her time; and Mrs. Elizabeth Ellet\r\nsupplemented the older histories by showing what an important part women\r\nhad played in the American Revolution.\r\n\r\n=The Struggle for Education.=--Along with criticism, there was carried\r\non a constructive struggle for better educational facilities for women\r\nwho had been from the beginning excluded from every college in the\r\ncountry. In this long battle, Emma Willard and Mary Lyon led the way;\r\nthe former founded a seminary at Troy, New York; and the latter made the\r\nbeginnings of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. Oberlin College in\r\nOhio, established in 1833, opened its doors to girls and from it were\r\ngraduated young students to lead in the woman movement. Sarah J. Hale,\r\nwho in 1827 became the editor of a \"Ladies' Magazine,\" published in\r\nBoston, conducted a campaign for equal educational opportunities which\r\nhelped to bear fruit in the founding of Vassar College shortly after the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\n=The Desire to Effect Reforms.=--As they came to study their own history\r\nand their own part in civilization, women naturally became deeply\r\ninterested in all the controversies going on around them. The temperance\r\nquestion made a special appeal to them and they organized to demand the\r\nright to be heard on it. In 1846 the \"Daughters of Temperance\" formed a\r\nsecret society favoring prohibition. They dared to criticize the\r\nchurches for their indifference and were so bold as to ask that\r\ndrunkenness be made a ground for divorce.\r\n\r\nThe slavery issue even more than temperance called women into public\r\nlife. The Grimké sisters of South Carolina emancipated their bondmen,\r\nand one of these sisters, exiled from Charleston for her \"Appeal to the\r\nChristian Women of the South,\" went North to work against the slavery\r\nsystem. In 1837 the National Women's Anti-Slavery Convention met in New\r\nYork; seventy-one women delegates represented eight states. Three years\r\nlater eight American women, five of them in Quaker costume, attended the\r\nWorld Anti-Slavery Convention in London, much to the horror of the men,\r\nwho promptly excluded them from the sessions on the ground that it was\r\nnot fitting for women to take part in such meetings.\r\n\r\nIn other spheres of activity, especially social service, women steadily\r\nenlarged their interest. Nothing human did they consider alien to them.\r\nThey inveighed against cruel criminal laws and unsanitary prisons. They\r\norganized poor relief and led in private philanthropy. Dorothea Dix\r\ndirected the movement that induced the New York legislature to establish\r\nin 1845 a separate asylum for the criminal insane. In the same year\r\nSarah G. Bagley organized the Lowell Female Reform Association for the\r\npurpose of reducing the long hours of labor for women, safeguarding \"the\r\nconstitutions of future generations.\" Mrs. Eliza Woodson Farnham, matron\r\nin Sing Sing penitentiary, was known throughout the nation for her\r\nsocial work, especially prison reform. Wherever there were misery and\r\nsuffering, women were preparing programs of relief.\r\n\r\n=Freedom of Speech for Women.=--In the advancement of their causes, of\r\nwhatever kind, women of necessity had to make public appeals and take\r\npart in open meetings. Here they encountered difficulties. The\r\nappearance of women on the platform was new and strange. Naturally it\r\nwas widely resented. Antoinette Brown, although she had credentials as a\r\ndelegate, was driven off the platform of a temperance convention in New\r\nYork City simply because she was a woman. James Russell Lowell, editor\r\nof the \"Atlantic Monthly,\" declined a poem from Julia Ward Howe on the\r\ntheory that no woman could write a poem; but he added on second thought\r\nthat he might consider an article in prose. Nathaniel Hawthorne,\r\nanother editor, even objected to something in prose because to him \"all\r\nink-stained women were equally detestable.\" To the natural resentment\r\nagainst their intrusion into new fields was added that aroused by their\r\nideas and methods. As temperance reformers, they criticized in a caustic\r\nmanner those who would not accept their opinions. As opponents of\r\nslavery they were especially bitter. One of their conventions, held at\r\nPhiladelphia in 1833, passed a resolution calling on all women to leave\r\nthose churches that would not condemn every form of human bondage. This\r\nstirred against them many of the clergy who, accustomed to having women\r\nsit silent during services, were in no mood to treat such a revolt\r\nleniently. Then came the last straw. Women decided that they would\r\npreach--out of the pulpit first, and finally in it.\r\n\r\n=Women in Industry.=--The period of this ferment was also the age of the\r\nindustrial revolution in America, the rise of the factory system, and\r\nthe growth of mill towns. The labor of women was transferred from the\r\nhomes to the factories. Then arose many questions: the hours of labor,\r\nthe sanitary conditions of the mills, the pressure of foreign\r\nimmigration on native labor, the wages of women as compared with those\r\nof men, and the right of married women to their own earnings. Labor\r\norganizations sprang up among working women. The mill girls of Lowell,\r\nMassachusetts, mainly the daughters of New England farmers, published a\r\nmagazine, \"The Lowell Offering.\" So excellent were their writings that\r\nthe French statesman, Thiers, carried a copy of their paper into the\r\nChamber of Deputies to show what working women could achieve in a\r\nrepublic. As women were now admittedly earning their own way in the\r\nworld by their own labor, they began to talk of their \"economic\r\nindependence.\"\r\n\r\n=The World Shaken by Revolution.=--Such was the quickening of women's\r\nminds in 1848 when the world was startled once more by a revolution in\r\nFrance which spread to Germany, Poland, Austria, Hungary, and Italy.\r\nOnce more the people of the earth began to explore the principles of\r\ndemocracy and expound human rights. Women, now better educated and more\r\n\"advanced\" in their ideas, played a rôle of still greater importance in\r\nthat revolution. They led in agitations and uprisings. They suffered\r\nfrom reaction and persecution. From their prison in France, two of them\r\nwho had been jailed for too much insistence on women's rights exchanged\r\ngreetings with American women who were raising the same issue here. By\r\nthis time the women had more supporters among the men. Horace Greeley,\r\neditor of the New York _Tribune_, though he afterwards recanted, used\r\nhis powerful pen in their behalf. Anti-slavery leaders welcomed their\r\naid and repaid them by urging the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n=The Woman's Rights Convention of 1848.=--The forces, moral and\r\nintellectual, which had been stirring among women, crystallized a few\r\nmonths after the outbreak of the European revolution in the first\r\nWoman's Rights Convention in the history of America. It met at Seneca\r\nFalls, New York, in 1848, on the call of Lucretia Mott, Martha Wright,\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, and Mary Ann McClintock, three of them Quakers.\r\nAccustomed to take part in church meetings with men, the Quakers\r\nnaturally suggested that men as well as women be invited to attend the\r\nconvention. Indeed, a man presided over the conference, for that\r\nposition seemed too presumptuous even for such stout advocates of\r\nwoman's rights.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the Seneca Falls convention resulted in a\r\nDeclaration of Rights modeled after the Declaration of Independence. For\r\nexample, the preamble began: \"When in the course of human events it\r\nbecomes necessary for one portion of the family of man to assume among\r\nthe people of the earth a position different from that which they have\r\nhitherto occupied....\" So also it closed: \"Such has been the patient\r\nsuffering of women under this government and such is now the necessity\r\nwhich constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are\r\nentitled.\" Then followed the list of grievances, the same number which\r\nhad been exhibited to George III in 1776. Especially did they assail the\r\ndisabilities imposed upon them by the English common law imported into\r\nAmerica--the law which denied married women their property, their wages,\r\nand their legal existence as separate persons. All these grievances they\r\nrecited to \"a candid world.\" The remedies for the evils which they\r\nendured were then set forth in detail. They demanded \"equal rights\" in\r\nthe colleges, trades, and professions; equal suffrage; the right to\r\nshare in all political offices, honors, and emoluments; the right to\r\ncomplete equality in marriage, including equal guardianship of the\r\nchildren; and for married women the right to own property, to keep\r\nwages, to make contracts, to transact business, and to testify in the\r\ncourts of justice. In short, they declared women to be persons as men\r\nare persons and entitled to all the rights and privileges of human\r\nbeings. Such was the clarion call which went forth to the world in\r\n1848--to an amused and contemptuous world, it must be admitted--but to a\r\nworld fated to heed and obey.\r\n\r\n=The First Gains in Civil Liberty.=--The convention of 1848 did not make\r\npolitical enfranchisement the leading issue. Rather did it emphasize the\r\ncivil disabilities of women which were most seriously under discussion\r\nat the time. Indeed, the New York legislature of that very year, as the\r\nresult of a twelve years' agitation, passed the Married Woman's Property\r\nAct setting aside the general principles of the English common law as\r\napplied to women and giving them many of the \"rights of man.\" California\r\nand Wisconsin followed in 1850; Massachusetts in 1854; and Kansas in\r\n1859. Other states soon fell into line. Women's earnings and\r\ninheritances were at last their own in some states at least. In a little\r\nwhile laws were passed granting women rights as equal guardians of their\r\nchildren and permitting them to divorce their husbands on the grounds of\r\ncruelty and drunkenness.\r\n\r\nBy degrees other steps were taken. The Woman's Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania was founded in 1850, and the Philadelphia School of Design\r\nfor Women three years later. In 1852 the American Women's Educational\r\nAssociation was formed to initiate an agitation for enlarged\r\neducational opportunities for women. Other colleges soon emulated the\r\nexample of Oberlin: the University of Utah in 1850; Hillsdale College in\r\nMichigan in 1855; Baker University in Kansas in 1858; and the University\r\nof Iowa in 1860. New trades and professions were opened to women and old\r\nprejudices against their activities and demands slowly gave way.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL STRUGGLE FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE\r\n\r\n=The Beginnings of Organization.=--As women surmounted one obstacle\r\nafter another, the agitation for equal suffrage came to the front. If\r\nany year is to be fixed as the date of its beginning, it may very well\r\nbe 1850, when the suffragists of Ohio urged the state constitutional\r\nconvention to confer the vote upon them. With apparent spontaneity there\r\nwere held in the same year state suffrage conferences in Indiana,\r\nPennsylvania, and Massachusetts; and connections were formed among the\r\nleaders of these meetings. At the same time the first national suffrage\r\nconvention was held in Worcester, Massachusetts, on the call of\r\neighty-nine leading men and women representing six states. Accounts of\r\nthe convention were widely circulated in this country and abroad.\r\nEnglish women,--for instance, Harriet Martineau,--sent words of\r\nappreciation for the work thus inaugurated. It inspired a leading\r\narticle in the \"Westminster Review,\" which deeply interested the\r\ndistinguished economist, John Stuart Mill. Soon he was the champion of\r\nwoman suffrage in the British Parliament and the author of a powerful\r\ntract _The Subjection of Women_, widely read throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world. Thus do world movements grow. Strange to relate\r\nthe women of England were enfranchised before the adoption of the\r\nfederal suffrage amendment in America.\r\n\r\nThe national suffrage convention of 1850 was followed by an\r\nextraordinary outburst of agitation. Pamphlets streamed from the press.\r\nPetitions to legislative bodies were drafted, signed, and presented.\r\nThere were addresses by favorite orators like Garrison, Phillips, and\r\nCurtis, and lectures and poems by men like Emerson, Longfellow, and\r\nWhittier. In 1853 the first suffrage paper was founded by the wife of a\r\nmember of Congress from Rhode Island. By this time the last barrier to\r\nwhite manhood suffrage in the North had been swept away and the woman's\r\nmovement was gaining momentum every year.\r\n\r\n=The Suffrage Movement Checked by the Civil War.=--Advocates of woman\r\nsuffrage believed themselves on the high road to success when the Civil\r\nWar engaged the energies and labors of the nation. Northern women became\r\nabsorbed in the struggle to preserve the union. They held no suffrage\r\nconventions for five years. They transformed their associations into\r\nLoyalty Leagues. They banded together to buy only domestic goods when\r\nforeign imports threatened to ruin American markets. They rolled up\r\nmonster petitions in favor of the emancipation of slaves. In hospitals,\r\nin military prisons, in agriculture, and in industry they bore their\r\nfull share of responsibility. Even when the New York legislature took\r\nadvantage of their unguarded moments and repealed the law giving the\r\nmother equal rights with the father in the guardianship of children,\r\nthey refused to lay aside war work for agitation. As in all other wars,\r\ntheir devotion was unstinted and their sacrifices equal to the\r\nnecessities of the hour.\r\n\r\n=The Federal Suffrage Amendment.=--Their plans and activities, when the\r\nwar closed, were shaped by events beyond their control. The emancipation\r\nof the slaves and their proposed enfranchisement made prominent the\r\nquestion of a national suffrage for the first time in our history.\r\nFriends of the colored man insisted that his civil liberties would not\r\nbe safe unless he was granted the right to vote. The woman suffragists\r\nvery pertinently asked why the same principle did not apply to women.\r\nThe answer which they received was negative. The fourteenth amendment to\r\nthe federal Constitution, adopted in 1868, definitely put women aside by\r\nlimiting the scope of its application, so far as the suffrage was\r\nconcerned, to the male sex. In making manhood suffrage national,\r\nhowever, it nationalized the issue.\r\n\r\nThis was the signal for the advocates of woman suffrage. In March, 1869,\r\ntheir proposed amendment was introduced in Congress by George W. Julian\r\nof Indiana. It provided that no citizen should be deprived of the vote\r\non account of sex, following the language of the fifteenth amendment\r\nwhich forbade disfranchisement on account of race. Support for the\r\namendment, coming from many directions, led the suffragists to believe\r\nthat their case was hopeful. In their platform of 1872, for example, the\r\nRepublicans praised the women for their loyal devotion to freedom,\r\nwelcomed them to spheres of wider usefulness, and declared that the\r\ndemand of any class of citizens for additional rights deserved\r\n\"respectful consideration.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nSUSAN B. ANTHONY]\r\n\r\nExperience soon demonstrated, however, that praise was not the ballot.\r\nIndeed the suffragists already had realized that a tedious contest lay\r\nbefore them. They had revived in 1866 their regular national convention.\r\nThey gave the name of \"The Revolution\" to their paper, edited by\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. They formed a national\r\nsuffrage association and organized annual pilgrimages to Congress to\r\npresent their claims. Such activities bore some results. Many eminent\r\ncongressmen were converted to their cause and presented it ably to their\r\ncolleagues of both chambers. Still the subject was ridiculed by the\r\nnewspapers and looked upon as freakish by the masses.\r\n\r\n=The State Campaigns.=--Discouraged by the outcome of the national\r\ncampaign, suffragists turned to the voters of the individual states and\r\nsought the ballot at their hands. Gains by this process were painfully\r\nslow. Wyoming, it is true, while still a territory, granted suffrage to\r\nwomen in 1869 and continued it on becoming a state twenty years later,\r\nin spite of strong protests in Congress. In 1893 Colorado established\r\ncomplete political equality. In Utah, the third suffrage state, the\r\ncause suffered many vicissitudes. Women were enfranchised by the\r\nterritorial legislature; they were deprived of the ballot by Congress in\r\n1887; finally in 1896 on the admission of Utah to the union they\r\nrecovered their former rights. During the same year, 1896, Idaho\r\nconferred equal suffrage upon the women. This was the last suffrage\r\nvictory for more than a decade.\r\n\r\n=The Suffrage Cause in Congress.=--In the midst of the meager gains\r\namong the states there were occasional flurries of hope for immediate\r\naction on the federal amendment. Between 1878 and 1896 the Senate\r\ncommittee reported the suffrage resolution by a favorable majority on\r\nfive different occasions. During the same period, however, there were\r\nnine unfavorable reports and only once did the subject reach the point\r\nof a general debate. At no time could anything like the required\r\ntwo-thirds vote be obtained.\r\n\r\n=The Changing Status of Women.=--While the suffrage movement was\r\nlagging, the activities of women in other directions were steadily\r\nmultiplying. College after college--Vassar, Bryn Mawr, Smith, Wellesley,\r\nto mention a few--was founded to give them the advantages of higher\r\neducation. Other institutions, especially the state universities of the\r\nWest, opened their doors to women, and women were received into the\r\nprofessions of law and medicine. By the rapid growth of public high\r\nschools in which girls enjoyed the same rights as boys, education was\r\nextended still more widely. The number of women teachers increased by\r\nleaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile women were entering nearly every branch of industry and\r\nbusiness. How many of them worked at gainful occupations before 1870 we\r\ndo not know; but from that year forward we have the records of the\r\ncensus. Between 1870 and 1900 the proportion of women in the professions\r\nrose from less than two per cent to more than ten per cent; in trade and\r\ntransportation from 24.8 per cent to 43.2 per cent; and in manufacturing\r\nfrom 13 to 19 per cent. In 1910, there were over 8,000,000 women\r\ngainfully employed as compared with 30,000,000 men. When, during the war\r\non Germany, the government established the principle of equal pay for\r\nequal work and gave official recognition to the value of their services\r\nin industry, it was discovered how far women had traveled along the road\r\nforecast by the leaders of 1848.\r\n\r\n=The Club Movement among Women.=--All over the country women's societies\r\nand clubs were started to advance this or that reform or merely to study\r\nliterature, art, and science. In time these women's organizations of all\r\nkinds were federated into city, state, and national associations and\r\ndrawn into the consideration of public questions. Under the leadership\r\nof Frances Willard they made temperance reform a vital issue. They took\r\nan interest in legislation pertaining to prisons, pure food, public\r\nhealth, and municipal government, among other things. At their sessions\r\nand conferences local, state, and national issues were discussed until\r\nfinally, it seems, everything led to the quest of the franchise. By\r\nsolemn resolution in 1914 the National Federation of Women's Clubs,\r\nrepresenting nearly two million club women, formally endorsed woman\r\nsuffrage. In the same year the National Education Association, speaking\r\nfor the public school teachers of the land, added its seal of approval.\r\n\r\n=State and National Action.=--Again the suffrage movement was in full\r\nswing in the states. Washington in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon,\r\nKansas, and Arizona in 1912, Nevada and Montana in 1914 by popular vote\r\nenfranchised their women. Illinois in 1913 conferred upon them the right\r\nto vote for President of the United States. The time had arrived for a\r\nnew movement. A number of younger suffragists sought to use the votes of\r\nwomen in the equal suffrage states to compel one or both of the national\r\npolitical parties to endorse and carry through Congress the federal\r\nsuffrage amendment. Pressure then came upon Congress from every\r\ndirection: from the suffragists who made a straight appeal on the\r\ngrounds of justice; and from the suffragists who besought the women of\r\nthe West to vote against candidates for President, who would not approve\r\nthe federal amendment. In 1916, for the first time, a leading\r\npresidential candidate, Mr. Charles E. Hughes, speaking for the\r\nRepublicans, endorsed the federal amendment and a distinguished\r\nex-President, Roosevelt, exerted a powerful influence to keep it an\r\nissue in the campaign.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nCONFERENCE OF MEN AND WOMEN DELEGATES AT A NATIONAL CONVENTION IN\r\n1920]\r\n\r\n=National Enfranchisement.=--After that, events moved rapidly. The great\r\nstate of New York adopted equal suffrage in 1917. Oklahoma, South\r\nDakota, and Michigan swung into line the following year; several other\r\nstates, by legislative action, gave women the right to vote for\r\nPresident. In the meantime the suffrage battle at Washington grew\r\nintense. Appeals and petitions poured in upon Congress and the\r\nPresident. Militant suffragists held daily demonstrations in Washington.\r\nOn September 30, 1918, President Wilson, who, two years before, had\r\nopposed federal action and endorsed suffrage by state adoption only,\r\nwent before Congress and urged the passage of the suffrage amendment to\r\nthe Constitution. In June, 1919, the requisite two-thirds vote was\r\nsecured; the resolution was carried and transmitted to the states for\r\nratification. On August 28, 1920, the thirty-sixth state, Tennessee,\r\napproved the amendment, making three-fourths of the states as required\r\nby the Constitution. Thus woman suffrage became the law of the land. A\r\nnew political democracy had been created. The age of agitation was\r\nclosed and the epoch of responsible citizenship opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n=General References=\r\n\r\nEdith Abbott, _Women in Industry_.\r\n\r\nC.P.

The nation had\r\ndefinitely passed into industrialism. The number of city dwellers\r\nemployed for wages as contrasted with the farmers working on their own\r\nland was steadily mounting. The free land, once the refuge of restless\r\nworkingmen of the East and the immigrants from Europe, was a thing of\r\nthe past. As President Roosevelt later said in speaking of the great\r\ncoal strike, \"a few generations ago, the American workman could have\r\nsaved money, gone West, and taken up a homestead. Now the free lands\r\nwere gone. In earlier days, a man who began with a pick and shovel might\r\ncome to own a mine. That outlet was now closed as regards the immense\r\nmajority.... The majority of men who earned wages in the coal industry,\r\nif they wished to progress at all, were compelled to progress not by\r\nceasing to be wage-earners but by improving the conditions under which\r\nall the wage-earners of the country lived and worked.\"\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the free land, President Roosevelt went on to say,\r\nalso produced \"a crass inequality in the bargaining relation of the\r\nemployer and the individual employee standing alone. The great\r\ncoal-mining and coal-carrying companies which employed their tens of\r\nthousands could easily dispense with the services of any particular\r\nminer. The miner, on the other hand, however expert, could not dispense\r\nwith the companies. He needed a job; his wife and children would starve\r\nif he did not get one.... Individually the miners were impotent when\r\nthey sought to enter a wage contract with the great companies; they\r\ncould make fair terms only by uniting into trade unions to bargain\r\ncollectively.\" It was of this state of affairs that President Taft spoke\r\nwhen he favored the modification of the common law \"so as to put\r\nemployees of little power and means on a level with their employers in\r\nadjusting and agreeing upon their mutual obligations.\"\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., on the side of the great captains of industry,\r\nrecognized the same facts. He said: \"In the early days of the\r\ndevelopment of industry, the employer and capital investor were\r\nfrequently one. Daily contact was had between him and his employees, who\r\nwere his friends and neighbors.... Because of the proportions which\r\nmodern industry has attained, employers and employees are too often\r\nstrangers to each other.... Personal relations can be revived only\r\nthrough adequate representation of the employees. Representation is a\r\nprinciple which is fundamentally just and vital to the successful\r\nconduct of industry.... It is not consistent for us as Americans to\r\ndemand democracy in government and practice autocracy in industry....\r\nWith the developments what they are in industry to-day, there is sure to\r\ncome a progressive evolution from aristocratic single control, whether\r\nby capital, labor, or the state, to democratic, coöperative control by\r\nall three.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOÖPERATION BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES\r\n\r\n=Company Unions.=--The changed economic life described by the three\r\neminent men just quoted was acknowledged by several great companies and\r\nbusiness concerns. All over the country decided efforts were made to\r\nbridge the gulf which industry and the corporation had created. Among\r\nthe devices adopted was that of the \"company union.\" In one of the\r\nWestern lumber mills, for example, all the employees were invited to\r\njoin a company organization; they held monthly meetings to discuss\r\nmatters of common concern; they elected a \"shop committee\" to confer\r\nwith the representatives of the company; and periodically the agents of\r\nthe employers attended the conferences of the men to talk over matters\r\nof mutual interest. The function of the shop committee was to consider\r\nwages, hours, safety rules, sanitation, recreation and other problems.\r\nWhenever any employee had a grievance he took it up with the foreman\r\nand, if it was not settled to his satisfaction, he brought it before the\r\nshop committee. If the members of the shop committee decided in favor of\r\nthe man with a grievance, they attempted to settle the matter with the\r\ncompany's agents. All these things failing, the dispute was transferred\r\nto a grand meeting of all the employees with the employers'\r\nrepresentatives, in common council. A deadlock, if it ensued from such a\r\nconference, was broken by calling in impartial arbitrators selected by\r\nboth sides from among citizens outside the mill. Thus the employees were\r\ngiven a voice in all decisions affecting their work and welfare; rights\r\nand grievances were treated as matters of mutual interest rather than\r\nindividual concern. Representatives of trade unions from outside,\r\nhowever, were rigidly excluded from all negotiations between employers\r\nand the employees.\r\n\r\n=Profit-sharing.=--Another proposal for drawing capital and labor\r\ntogether was to supplement the wage system by other ties. Sometimes lump\r\nsums were paid to employees who remained in a company's service for a\r\ndefinite period of years. Again they were given a certain percentage of\r\nthe annual profits. In other instances, employees were allowed to buy\r\nstock on easy terms and thus become part owners in the concern. This\r\nlast plan was carried so far by a large soap manufacturing company that\r\nthe employees, besides becoming stockholders, secured the right to elect\r\nrepresentatives to serve on the board of directors who managed the\r\nentire business. So extensive had profit-sharing become by 1914 that the\r\nFederal Industrial Relations Committee, appointed by the President,\r\ndeemed it worthy of a special study. Though opposed by regular trade\r\nunions, it was undoubtedly growing in popularity.\r\n\r\n=Labor Managers and Welfare Work.=--Another effort of employers to meet\r\nthe problems of the new age appeared in the appointment of specialists,\r\nknown as employment managers, whose task it was to study the relations\r\nexisting between masters and workers and discover practical methods for\r\ndealing with each grievance as it arose. By 1918, hundreds of big\r\ncompanies had recognized this modern \"profession\" and universities were\r\ngiving courses of instruction on the subject to young men and women. In\r\nthat year a national conference of employment managers was held at\r\nRochester, New York. The discussion revealed a wide range of duties\r\nassigned to managers, including questions of wages, hours, sanitation,\r\nrest rooms, recreational facilities, and welfare work of every kind\r\ndesigned to make the conditions in mills and factories safer and more\r\nhumane. Thus it was evident that hundreds of employers had abandoned the\r\nold idea that they were dealing merely with individual employees and\r\nthat their obligations ended with the payment of any wages they saw fit\r\nto fix. In short, they were seeking to develop a spirit of coöperation\r\nto take the place of competition and enmity; and to increase the\r\nproduction of commodities by promoting the efficiency and happiness of\r\nthe producers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE AND GROWTH OF ORGANIZED LABOR\r\n\r\n=The American Federation of Labor.=--Meanwhile a powerful association of\r\nworkers representing all the leading trades and crafts, organized into\r\nunions of their own, had been built up outside the control of employers.\r\nThis was the American Federation of Labor, a nation-wide union of\r\nunions, founded in 1886 on the basis of beginnings made five years\r\nbefore. At the time of its establishment it had approximately 150,000\r\nmembers. Its growth up to the end of the century was slow, for the total\r\nenrollment in 1900 was only 300,000. At that point the increase became\r\nmarked. The membership reached 1,650,000 in 1904 and more than 3,000,000\r\nin 1919. To be counted in the ranks of organized labor were several\r\nstrong unions, friendly to the Federation, though not affiliated with\r\nit. Such, for example, were the Railway Brotherhoods with more than half\r\na million members. By the opening of 1920 the total strength of\r\norganized labor was put at about 4,000,000 members, meaning, if we\r\ninclude their families, that nearly one-fifth of the people of the\r\nUnited States were in some positive way dependent upon the operations of\r\ntrade unions.\r\n\r\n=Historical Background.=--This was the culmination of a long and\r\nsignificant history. Before the end of the eighteenth century, the\r\nskilled workmen--printers, shoemakers, tailors, and carpenters--had, as\r\nwe have seen, formed local unions in the large cities. Between 1830 and\r\n1860, several aggressive steps were taken in the American labor\r\nmovement. For one thing, the number of local unions increased by leaps\r\nand bounds in all the industrial towns. For another, there was\r\nestablished in every large manufacturing city a central labor body\r\ncomposed of delegates from the unions of the separate trades. In the\r\nlocal union the printers or the cordwainers, for example, considered\r\nonly their special trade problems. In the central labor union, printers,\r\ncordwainers, iron molders, and other craftsmen considered common\r\nproblems and learned to coöperate with one another in enforcing the\r\ndemands of each craft. A third step was the federation of the unions of\r\nthe same craftsmen in different cities. The printers of New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Boston, and other towns, for instance, drew together and\r\nformed a national trade union of printers built upon the local unions of\r\nthat craft. By the eve of the Civil War there were four or five powerful\r\nnational unions of this character. The expansion of the railway made\r\ntravel and correspondence easier and national conventions possible even\r\nfor workmen of small means. About 1834 an attempt was made to federate\r\nthe unions of all the different crafts into a national organization; but\r\nthe effort was premature.\r\n\r\n_The National Labor Union._--The plan which failed in 1834 was tried\r\nagain in the sixties. During the war, industries and railways had\r\nflourished as never before; prices had risen rapidly; the demand for\r\nlabor had increased; wages had mounted slowly, but steadily. Hundreds of\r\nnew local unions had been founded and eight or ten national trade unions\r\nhad sprung into being. The time was ripe, it seemed, for a national\r\nconsolidation of all labor's forces; and in 1866, the year after the\r\nsurrender of General Lee at Appomattox, the \"National Labor Union\" was\r\nformed at Baltimore under the leadership of an experienced organizer,\r\nW.H. Sylvis of the iron molders. The purpose of the National Labor Union\r\nwas not merely to secure labor's standard demands touching hours, wages,\r\nand conditions of work or to maintain the gains already won. It leaned\r\ntoward political action and radical opinions. Above all, it sought to\r\neliminate the conflict between capital and labor by making workingmen\r\nthe owners of shops through the formation of coöperative industries. For\r\nsix years the National Labor Union continued to hold conferences and\r\ncarry on its propaganda; but most of the coöperative enterprises failed,\r\npolitical dissensions arose, and by 1872 the experiment had come to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n_The Knights of Labor._--While the National Labor Union was\r\nexperimenting, there grew up in the industrial world a more radical\r\norganization known as the \"Noble Order of the Knights of Labor.\" It was\r\nfounded in Philadelphia in 1869, first as a secret society with rituals,\r\nsigns, and pass words; \"so that no spy of the boss can find his way into\r\nthe lodge room to betray his fellows,\" as the Knights put it. In form\r\nthe new organization was simple. It sought to bring all laborers,\r\nskilled and unskilled, men and women, white and colored, into a mighty\r\nbody of local and national unions without distinction of trade or craft.\r\nBy 1885, ten years after the national organization was established, it\r\nboasted a membership of over 700,000. In philosophy, the Knights of\r\nLabor were socialistic, for they advocated public ownership of the\r\nrailways and other utilities and the formation of coöperative societies\r\nto own and manage stores and factories.\r\n\r\nAs the Knights were radical in spirit and their strikes, numerous and\r\nprolonged, were often accompanied by violence, the organization alarmed\r\nemployers and the general public, raising up against itself a vigorous\r\nopposition. Weaknesses within, as well as foes from without, started the\r\nKnights on the path to dissolution. They waged more strikes than they\r\ncould carry on successfully; their coöperative experiments failed as\r\nthose of other labor groups before them had failed; and the rank and\r\nfile could not be kept in line. The majority of the members wanted\r\nimmediate gains in wages or the reduction of hours; when their hopes\r\nwere not realized they drifted away from the order. The troubles were\r\nincreased by the appearance of the American Federation of Labor, a still\r\nmightier organization composed mainly of skilled workers who held\r\nstrategic positions in industry. When they failed to secure the\r\neffective support of the Federation in their efforts to organize the\r\nunskilled, the employers closed in upon them; then the Knights declined\r\nrapidly in power. By 1890 they were a negligible factor and in a short\r\ntime they passed into the limbo of dead experiments.\r\n\r\n=The Policies of the American Federation.=--Unlike the Knights of Labor,\r\nthe American Federation of Labor sought, first of all, to be very\r\npractical in its objects and methods. It avoided all kinds of\r\nsocialistic theories and attended strictly to the business of organizing\r\nunions for the purpose of increasing wages, shortening hours, and\r\nimproving working conditions for its members. It did not try to include\r\neverybody in one big union but brought together the employees of each\r\nparticular craft whose interests were clearly the same. To prepare for\r\nstrikes and periods of unemployment, it raised large funds by imposing\r\nheavy dues and created a benefit system to hold men loyally to the\r\nunion. In order to permit action on a national scale, it gave the\r\nsuperior officers extensive powers over local unions.\r\n\r\nWhile declaring that employers and employees had much in common, the\r\nFederation strongly opposed company unions. Employers, it argued, were\r\naffiliated with the National Manufacturers' Association or with similar\r\nemployers' organizations; every important industry was now national in\r\nscope; and wages and hours, in view of competition with other shops,\r\ncould not be determined in a single factory, no matter how amicable\r\nmight be the relations of the company and its workers in that particular\r\nplant. For these reasons, the Federation declared company unions and\r\nlocal shop committees inherently weak; it insisted that hours, wages,\r\nand other labor standards should be fixed by general trade agreements\r\napplicable to all the plants of a given industry, even if subject to\r\nlocal modifications.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the Federation, far from deliberately antagonizing\r\nemployers, sought to enlist their coöperation and support. It affiliated\r\nwith the National Civic Federation, an association of business men,\r\nfinanciers, and professional men, founded in 1900 to promote friendly\r\nrelations in the industrial world. In brief, the American Federation of\r\nLabor accepted the modern industrial system and, by organization within\r\nit, endeavored to secure certain definite terms and conditions for trade\r\nunionists.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIDER RELATIONS OF ORGANIZED LABOR\r\n\r\n=The Socialists.=--The trade unionism \"pure and simple,\" espoused by the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labor, seemed to involve at first glance nothing\r\nbut businesslike negotiations with employers. In practice it did not\r\nwork out that way. The Federation was only six years old when a new\r\norganization, appealing directly for the labor vote--namely, the\r\nSocialist Labor Party--nominated a candidate for President, launched\r\ninto a national campaign, and called upon trade unionists to desert the\r\nolder parties and enter its fold.\r\n\r\nThe socialistic idea, introduced into national politics in 1892, had\r\nbeen long in germination. Before the Civil War, a number of reformers,\r\nincluding Nathaniel Hawthorne, Horace Greeley, and Wendell Phillips,\r\ndeeply moved by the poverty of the great industrial cities, had\r\nearnestly sought relief in the establishment of coöperative or\r\ncommunistic colonies. They believed that people should go into the\r\ncountry, secure land and tools, own them in common so that no one could\r\nprofit from exclusive ownership, and produce by common labor the food\r\nand clothing necessary for their support. For a time this movement\r\nattracted wide interest, but it had little vitality. Nearly all the\r\ncolonies failed. Selfishness and indolence usually disrupted the best of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time this \"Utopian\" idea was abandoned, and another set\r\nof socialist doctrines, claiming to be more \"scientific,\" appeared\r\ninstead. The new school of socialists, adopting the principles of a\r\nGerman writer and agitator, Karl Marx, appealed directly to workingmen.\r\nIt urged them to unite against the capitalists, to get possession of the\r\nmachinery of government, and to introduce collective or public ownership\r\nof railways, land, mines, mills, and other means of production. The\r\nMarxian socialists, therefore, became political. They sought to organize\r\nlabor and to win elections. Like the other parties they put forward\r\ncandidates and platforms. The Socialist Labor party in 1892, for\r\nexample, declared in favor of government ownership of utilities, free\r\nschool books, woman suffrage, heavy income taxes, and the referendum.\r\nThe Socialist party, founded in 1900, with Eugene V. Debs, the leader of\r\nthe Pullman strike, as its candidate, called for public ownership of all\r\ntrusts, monopolies, mines, railways; and the chief means of production.\r\nIn the course of time the vote of the latter organization rose to\r\nconsiderable proportions, reaching almost a million in 1912. It declined\r\nfour years later and then rose in 1920 to about the same figure.\r\n\r\nIn their appeal for votes, the socialists of every type turned first to\r\nlabor. At the annual conventions of the American Federation of Labor\r\nthey besought the delegates to endorse socialism. The president of the\r\nFederation, Samuel Gompers, on each occasion took the floor against\r\nthem. He repudiated socialism and the socialists, on both theoretical\r\nand practical grounds. He opposed too much public ownership, declaring\r\nthat the government was as likely as any private employer to oppress\r\nlabor. The approval of socialism, he maintained, would split the\r\nFederation on the rock of politics, weaken it in its fight for higher\r\nwages and shorter hours, and prejudice the public against it. At every\r\nturn he was able to vanquish the socialists in the Federation, although\r\nhe could not prevent it from endorsing public ownership of the railways\r\nat the convention of 1920.\r\n\r\n=The Extreme Radicals.=--Some of the socialists, defeated in their\r\nefforts to capture organized labor and seeing that the gains in\r\nelections were very meager, broke away from both trade unionism and\r\npolitics. One faction, the Industrial Workers of the World, founded in\r\n1905, declared themselves opposed to all capitalists, the wages system,\r\nand craft unions. They asserted that the \"working class and the\r\nemploying class have nothing in common\" and that trade unions only\r\npitted one set of workers against another set. They repudiated all\r\ngovernment ownership and the government itself, boldly proclaiming their\r\nintention to unite all employees into one big union and seize the\r\nrailways, mines, and mills of the country. This doctrine, so\r\nrevolutionary in tone, called down upon the extremists the condemnation\r\nof the American Federation of Labor as well as of the general public. At\r\nits convention in 1919, the Federation went on record as \"opposed to\r\nBolshevism, I.W.W.-ism, and the irresponsible leadership that encourages\r\nsuch a policy.\" It announced its \"firm adherence to American ideals.\"\r\n\r\n=The Federation and Political Issues.=--The hostility of the Federation\r\nto the socialists did not mean, however, that it was indifferent to\r\npolitical issues or political parties. On the contrary, from time to\r\ntime, at its annual conventions, it endorsed political and social\r\nreforms, such as the initiative, referendum, and recall, the abolition\r\nof child labor, the exclusion of Oriental labor, old-age pensions, and\r\ngovernment ownership. Moreover it adopted the policy of \"rewarding\r\nfriends and punishing enemies\" by advising members to vote for or\r\nagainst candidates according to their stand on the demands of organized\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nSAMUEL GOMPERS AND OTHER LABOR LEADERS]\r\n\r\nThis policy was pursued with especial zeal in connection with disputes\r\nover the use of injunctions in labor controversies. An injunction is a\r\nbill or writ issued by a judge ordering some person or corporation to do\r\nor to refrain from doing something. For example, a judge may order a\r\ntrade union to refrain from interfering with non-union men or to\r\ncontinue at work handling goods made by non-union labor; and he may fine\r\nor imprison those who disobey his injunction, the penalty being\r\ninflicted for \"contempt of court.\" This ancient legal device came into\r\nprominence in connection with nation-wide railway strikes in 1877. It\r\nwas applied with increasing frequency after its effective use against\r\nEugene V. Debs in the Pullman strike of 1894.\r\n\r\nAroused by the extensive use of the writ, organized labor demanded that\r\nthe power of judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes be limited by\r\nlaw. Representatives of the unions sought support from the Democrats and\r\nthe Republicans; they received from the former very specific and cordial\r\nendorsement. In 1896 the Democratic platform denounced \"government by\r\ninjunction as a new and highly dangerous form of oppression.\" Mr.\r\nGompers, while refusing to commit the Federation to Democratic politics,\r\nprivately supported Mr. Bryan. In 1908, he came out openly and boasted\r\nthat eighty per cent of the votes of the Federation had been cast for\r\nthe Democratic candidate. Again in 1912 the same policy was pursued. The\r\nreward was the enactment in 1914 of a federal law exempting trade unions\r\nfrom prosecution as combinations in restraint of trade, limiting the use\r\nof the injunction in labor disputes, and prescribing trial by jury in\r\ncase of contempt of court. This measure was hailed by Mr. Gompers as the\r\n\"Magna Carta of Labor\" and a vindication of his policy. As a matter of\r\nfact, however, it did not prevent the continued use of injunctions\r\nagainst trade unions. Nevertheless Mr. Gompers was unshaken in his\r\nconviction that organized labor should not attempt to form an\r\nindependent political party or endorse socialist or other radical\r\neconomic theories.\r\n\r\n=Organized Labor and the Public.=--Besides its relations to employers,\r\nradicals within its own ranks, and political questions, the Federation\r\nhad to face responsibilities to the general public. With the passing of\r\ntime these became heavy and grave. While industries were small and\r\nconflicts were local in character, a strike seldom affected anybody but\r\nthe employer and the employees immediately involved in it. When,\r\nhowever, industries and trade unions became organized on a national\r\nscale and a strike could paralyze a basic enterprise like coal mining or\r\nrailways, the vital interests of all citizens were put in jeopardy.\r\nMoreover, as increases in wages and reductions in hours often added\r\ndirectly to the cost of living, the action of the unions affected the\r\nwell-being of all--the food, clothing, and shelter of the whole people.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of meeting the issue raised by this state of affairs, it\r\nwas suggested that employers and employees should lay their disputes\r\nbefore commissions of arbitration for decision and settlement. President\r\nCleveland, in a message of April 2, 1886, proposed such a method for\r\ndisposing of industrial controversies, and two years later Congress\r\nenacted a voluntary arbitration law applicable to the railways. The\r\nprinciple was extended in 1898 and again in 1913, and under the\r\nauthority of the federal government many contentions in the railway\r\nworld were settled by arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe success of such legislation induced some students of industrial\r\nquestions to urge that unions and employers should be compelled to\r\nsubmit all disputes to official tribunals of arbitration. Kansas\r\nactually passed such a law in 1920. Congress in the Esch-Cummins railway\r\nbill of the same year created a federal board of nine members to which\r\nall railway controversies, not settled by negotiation, must be\r\nsubmitted. Strikes, however, were not absolutely forbidden. Generally\r\nspeaking, both employers and employees opposed compulsory adjustments\r\nwithout offering any substitute in case voluntary arbitration should not\r\nbe accepted by both parties to a dispute.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMIGRATION AND AMERICANIZATION\r\n\r\n=The Problems of Immigration.=--From its very inception, the American\r\nFederation of Labor, like the Knights of Labor before it, was confronted\r\nby numerous questions raised by the ever swelling tide of aliens coming\r\nto our shores. In its effort to make each trade union all-inclusive, it\r\nhad to wrestle with a score or more languages. When it succeeded in\r\nthoroughly organizing a craft, it often found its purposes defeated by\r\nan influx of foreigners ready to work for lower wages and thus undermine\r\nthe foundations of the union.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, persons outside the labor movement began to be\r\napprehensive as they contemplated the undoubted evil, as well as the\r\ngood, that seemed to be associated with the \"alien invasion.\" They saw\r\nwhole sections of great cities occupied by people speaking foreign\r\ntongues, reading only foreign newspapers, and looking to the Old World\r\nalone for their ideas and their customs. They witnessed an expanding\r\narmy of total illiterates, men and women who could read and write no\r\nlanguage at all; while among those aliens who could read few there were\r\nwho knew anything of American history, traditions, and ideals. Official\r\nreports revealed that over twenty per cent of the men of the draft army\r\nduring the World War could not read a newspaper or write a letter home.\r\nPerhaps most alarming of all was the discovery that thousands of alien\r\nmen are in the United States only on a temporary sojourn, solely to make\r\nmoney and return home with their savings. These men, willing to work for\r\nlow wages and live in places unfit for human beings, have no stake in\r\nthis country and do not care what becomes of it.\r\n\r\n=The Restriction of Immigration.=--In all this there was, strictly\r\nspeaking, no cause for surprise. Since the foundation of our republic\r\nthe policy of the government had been to encourage the coming of the\r\nalien. For nearly one hundred years no restraining act was passed by\r\nCongress, while two important laws positively encouraged it; namely, the\r\nhomestead act of 1862 and the contract immigration law of 1864. Not\r\nuntil American workingmen came into open collision with cheap Chinese\r\nlabor on the Pacific Coast did the federal government spread the first\r\nmeasure of limitation on the statute books. After the discovery of gold,\r\nand particularly after the opening of the railway construction era, a\r\nhorde of laborers from China descended upon California. Accustomed to\r\nstarvation wages and indifferent to the conditions of living, they\r\nthreatened to cut the American standard to the point of subsistence. By\r\n1876 the protest of American labor was loud and long and both the\r\nRepublicans and the Democrats gave heed to it. In 1882 Congress enacted\r\na law prohibiting the admission of Chinese laborers to the United States\r\nfor a term of ten years--later extended by legislation. In a little\r\nwhile the demand arose for the exclusion of the Japanese as well. In\r\nthis case no exclusion law was passed; but an understanding was reached\r\nby which Japan agreed not to issue passports to her laborers authorizing\r\nthem to come to the United States. By act of Congress in 1907 the\r\nPresident was empowered to exclude any laborers who, having passports to\r\nCanada, Hawaii, or Mexico, attempted to enter our country.\r\n\r\nThese laws and agreements, however, did not remove all grounds for the\r\nagitation of the subject. They were difficult to enforce and it was\r\nclaimed by residents of the Coast that in spite of federal authority\r\nOriental laborers were finding their way into American ports. Moreover,\r\nseveral Western states, anxious to preserve the soil for American\r\nownership, enacted laws making it impossible for Chinese and Japanese to\r\nbuy land outright; and in other ways they discriminated against\r\nOrientals. Such proceedings placed the federal government in an\r\nembarrassing position. By treaty it had guaranteed specific rights to\r\nJapanese citizens in the United States, and the government at Tokyo\r\ncontended that the state laws just cited violated the terms of the\r\ninternational agreement. The Western states were fixed in their\r\ndetermination to control Oriental residents; Japan was equally\r\npersistent in asking that no badge of inferiority be attached to her\r\ncitizens. Subjected to pressure on both sides, the federal government\r\nsought a way out of the deadlock.\r\n\r\nHaving embarked upon the policy of restriction in 1882, Congress readily\r\nextended it. In that same year it barred paupers, criminals, convicts,\r\nand the insane. Three years later, mainly owing to the pressure of the\r\nKnights of Labor, it forbade any person, company, or association to\r\nimport aliens under contract. By an act of 1887, the contract labor\r\nrestriction was made even more severe. In 1903, anarchists were excluded\r\nand the bureau of immigration was transferred from the Treasury\r\nDepartment to the Department of Commerce and Labor, in order to provide\r\nfor a more rigid execution of the law. In 1907 the classes of persons\r\ndenied admission were widened to embrace those suffering from physical\r\nand mental defects and otherwise unfit for effective citizenship. When\r\nthe Department of Labor was established in 1913 the enforcement of the\r\nlaw was placed in the hands of the Secretary of Labor, W.B. Wilson, who\r\nwas a former leader in the American Federation of Labor.\r\n\r\n=The Literacy Test.=--Still the advocates of restriction were not\r\nsatisfied. Still organized labor protested and demanded more protection\r\nagainst the competition of immigrants. In 1917 it won a thirty-year\r\nbattle in the passage of a bill excluding \"all aliens over sixteen years\r\nof age, physically capable of reading, who cannot read the English\r\nlanguage or some other language or dialect, including Hebrew or\r\nYiddish.\" Even President Wilson could not block it, for a two-thirds\r\nvote to overcome his veto was mustered in Congress.\r\n\r\nThis act, while it served to exclude illiterates, made no drastic cut in\r\nthe volume of immigration. Indeed a material reduction was resolutely\r\nopposed in many quarters. People of certain nationalities already in the\r\nUnited States objected to every barrier that shut out their own kinsmen.\r\nSome Americans of the old stock still held to the idea that the United\r\nStates should continue to be an asylum for \"the oppressed of the earth.\"\r\nMany employers looked upon an increased labor supply as the means of\r\nescaping what they called \"the domination of trade unions.\" In the babel\r\nof countless voices, the discussion of these vital matters went on in\r\ntown and country.\r\n\r\n=Americanization.=--Intimately connected with the subject of immigration\r\nwas a call for the \"Americanization\" of the alien already within our\r\ngates. The revelation of the illiteracy in the army raised the cry and\r\nthe demand was intensified when it was found that many of the leaders\r\namong the extreme radicals were foreign in birth and citizenship.\r\nInnumerable programs for assimilating the alien to American life were\r\ndrawn up, and in 1919 a national conference on the subject was held in\r\nWashington under the auspices of the Department of the Interior. All\r\nwere agreed that the foreigner should be taught to speak and write the\r\nlanguage and understand the government of our country. Congress was\r\nurged to lend aid in this vast undertaking. America, as ex-President\r\nRoosevelt had said, was to find out \"whether it was a nation or a\r\nboarding-house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=General References=\r\n\r\nJ.R.

In this spirit, as President,\r\nhe gave the signal for work by summoning Congress in a special session\r\non April 7, 1913. He invited the coöperation of all \"forward-looking\r\nmen\" and indicated that he would assume the rôle of leadership. As an\r\nevidence of his resolve, he appeared before Congress in person to read\r\nhis first message, reviving the old custom of Washington and Adams. Then\r\nhe let it be known that he would not give his party any rest until it\r\nfulfilled its pledges to the country. When Democratic Senators balked at\r\ntariff reductions, they were sharply informed that the party had\r\nplighted its word and that no excuses or delays would be tolerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n=Financial Measures.=--Under this spirited leadership Congress went to\r\nwork, passing first the Underwood tariff act of 1913, which made a\r\ndownward revision in the rates of duty, fixing them on the average about\r\ntwenty-six per cent lower than the figures of 1907. The protective\r\nprinciple was retained, but an effort was made to permit a moderate\r\nelement of foreign competition. As a part of the revenue act Congress\r\nlevied a tax on incomes as authorized by the sixteenth amendment to the\r\nConstitution. The tax which roused such party passions twenty years\r\nbefore was now accepted as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of the tariff, Congress took up the old and vexatious\r\ncurrency question and offered a new solution in the form of the federal\r\nreserve law of December, 1913. This measure, one of the most interesting\r\nin the history of federal finance, embraced four leading features. In\r\nthe first place, it continued the prohibition on the issuance of notes\r\nby state banks and provided for a national currency. In the second\r\nplace, it put the new banking system under the control of a federal\r\nreserve board composed entirely of government officials. To prevent the\r\ngrowth of a \"central money power,\" it provided, in the third place, for\r\nthe creation of twelve federal reserve banks, one in each of twelve\r\ngreat districts into which the country is divided. All local national\r\nbanks were required and certain other banks permitted to become members\r\nof the new system and share in its control. Finally, with a view to\r\nexpanding the currency, a step which the Democrats had long urged upon\r\nthe country, the issuance of paper money, under definite safeguards, was\r\nauthorized.\r\n\r\nMindful of the agricultural interest, ever dear to the heart of\r\nJefferson's followers, the Democrats supplemented the reserve law by the\r\nFarm Loan Act of 1916, creating federal agencies to lend money on farm\r\nmortgages at moderate rates of interest. Within a year $20,000,000 had\r\nbeen lent to farmers, the heaviest borrowing being in nine Western and\r\nSouthern states, with Texas in the lead.\r\n\r\n=Anti-trust Legislation.=--The tariff and currency laws were followed by\r\nthree significant measures relative to trusts. Rejecting utterly the\r\nProgressive doctrine of government regulation, President Wilson\r\nannounced that it was the purpose of the Democrats \"to destroy monopoly\r\nand maintain competition as the only effective instrument of business\r\nliberty.\" The first step in this direction, the Clayton Anti-trust Act,\r\ncarried into great detail the Sherman law of 1890 forbidding and\r\npenalizing combinations in restraint of interstate and foreign trade. In\r\nevery line it revealed a determined effort to tear apart the great\r\ntrusts and to put all business on a competitive basis. Its terms were\r\nreinforced in the same year by a law creating a Federal Trade Commission\r\nempowered to inquire into the methods of corporations and lodge\r\ncomplaints against concerns \"using any unfair method of competition.\" In\r\nonly one respect was the severity of the Democratic policy relaxed. An\r\nact of 1918 provided that the Sherman law should not apply to companies\r\nengaged in export trade, the purpose being to encourage large\r\ncorporations to enter foreign commerce.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this whole body of anti-trust legislation, in spite of\r\nmuch labor on it, remained problematical. Very few combinations were\r\ndissolved as a result of it. Startling investigations were made into\r\nalleged abuses on the part of trusts; but it could hardly be said that\r\nhuge business concerns had lost any of their predominance in American\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n=Labor Legislation.=--By no mere coincidence, the Clayton Anti-trust law\r\nof 1914 made many concessions to organized labor. It declared that \"the\r\nlabor of a human being is not a commodity or an article of commerce,\"\r\nand it exempted unions from prosecution as \"combinations in restraint of\r\ntrade.\" It likewise defined and limited the uses which the federal\r\ncourts might make of injunctions in labor disputes and guaranteed trial\r\nby jury to those guilty of disobedience (see p. 581).\r\n\r\nThe Clayton law was followed the next year by the Seamen's Act giving\r\ngreater liberty of contract to American sailors and requiring an\r\nimprovement of living conditions on shipboard. This was such a drastic\r\nlaw that shipowners declared themselves unable to meet foreign\r\ncompetition under its terms, owing to the low labor standards of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nStill more extraordinary than the Seamen's Act was the Adamson law of\r\n1916 fixing a standard eight-hour work-day for trainmen on railroads--a\r\nmeasure wrung from Congress under a threat of a great strike by the four\r\nRailway Brotherhoods. This act, viewed by union leaders as a triumph,\r\ncalled forth a bitter denunciation of \"trade union domination,\" but it\r\nwas easier to criticize than to find another solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nThree other laws enacted during President Wilson's administration were\r\npopular in the labor world. One of them provided compensation for\r\nfederal employees injured in the discharge of their duties. Another\r\nprohibited the labor of children under a certain age in the industries\r\nof the nation. A third prescribed for coal miners in Alaska an\r\neight-hour day and modern safeguards for life and health. There were\r\npositive proofs that organized labor had obtained a large share of power\r\nin the councils of the country.\r\n\r\n=Federal and State Relations.=--If the interference of the government\r\nwith business and labor represented a departure from the old idea of\r\n\"the less government the better,\" what can be said of a large body of\r\nlaws affecting the rights of states? The prohibition of child labor\r\neverywhere was one indication of the new tendency. Mr. Wilson had once\r\ndeclared such legislation unconstitutional; the Supreme Court declared\r\nit unconstitutional; but Congress, undaunted, carried it into effect\r\nunder the guise of a tax on goods made by children below the age limit.\r\nThere were other indications of the drift. Large sums of money were\r\nappropriated by Congress in 1916 to assist the states in building and\r\nmaintaining highways. The same year the Farm Loan Act projected the\r\nfederal government into the sphere of local money lending. In 1917\r\nmillions of dollars were granted to states in aid of vocational\r\neducation, incidentally imposing uniform standards throughout the\r\ncountry. Evidently the government was no longer limited to the duties of\r\nthe policeman.\r\n\r\n=The Prohibition Amendment.=--A still more significant form of\r\nintervention in state affairs was the passage, in December, 1917, of an\r\namendment to the federal Constitution establishing national prohibition\r\nof the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors as beverages. This\r\nwas the climax of a historical movement extending over half a century.\r\nIn 1872, a National Prohibition party, launched three years before,\r\nnominated its first presidential candidate and inaugurated a campaign of\r\nagitation. Though its vote was never large, the cause for which it\r\nstood found increasing favor among the people. State after state by\r\npopular referendum abolished the liquor traffic within its borders. By\r\n1917 at least thirty-two of the forty-eight were \"dry.\" When the federal\r\namendment was submitted for approval, the ratification was surprisingly\r\nswift. In a little more than a year, namely, on January 16, 1919, it was\r\nproclaimed. Twelve months later the amendment went into effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONIAL AND FOREIGN POLICIES\r\n\r\n=The Philippines and Porto Rico.=--Independence for the Philippines and\r\nlarger self-government for Porto Rico had been among the policies of the\r\nDemocratic party since the campaign of 1900. President Wilson in his\r\nannual messages urged upon Congress more autonomy for the Filipinos and\r\na definite promise of final independence. The result was the Jones\r\nOrganic Act for the Philippines passed in 1916. This measure provided\r\nthat the upper as well as the lower house of the Philippine legislature\r\nshould be elected by popular vote, and declared it to be the intention\r\nof the United States to grant independence \"as soon as a stable\r\ngovernment can be established.\" This, said President Wilson on signing\r\nthe bill, is \"a very satisfactory advance in our policy of extending to\r\nthem self-government and control of their own affairs.\" The following\r\nyear Congress, yielding to President Wilson's insistence, passed a new\r\norganic act for Porto Rico, making both houses of the legislature\r\nelective and conferring American citizenship upon the inhabitants of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARIBBEAN REGION]\r\n\r\n=American Power in the Caribbean.=--While extending more self-government\r\nto its dominions, the United States enlarged its sphere of influence in\r\nthe Caribbean. The supervision of finances in Santo Domingo, inaugurated\r\nin Roosevelt's administration, was transformed into a protectorate under\r\nWilson. In 1914 dissensions in the republic led to the landing of\r\nAmerican marines to \"supervise\" the elections. Two years later, an\r\nofficer in the American navy, with authority from Washington, placed\r\nthe entire republic \"in a state of military occupation.\" He proceeded to\r\nsuspend the government and laws of the country, exile the president,\r\nsuppress the congress, and substitute American military authority. In\r\n1919 a consulting board of four prominent Dominicans was appointed to\r\naid the American military governor; but it resigned the next year after\r\nmaking a plea for the restoration of independence to the republic. For\r\nall practical purposes, it seemed, the sovereignty of Santo Domingo had\r\nbeen transferred to the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the neighboring republic of Haiti, a similar state of affairs\r\nexisted. In the summer of 1915 a revolution broke out there--one of a\r\nlong series beginning in 1804--and our marines were landed to restore\r\norder. Elections were held under the supervision of American officers,\r\nand a treaty was drawn up placing the management of Haitian finances and\r\nthe local constabulary under American authority. In taking this action,\r\nour Secretary of State was careful to announce: \"The United States\r\ngovernment has no purpose of aggression and is entirely disinterested in\r\npromoting this protectorate.\" Still it must be said that there were\r\nvigorous protests on the part of natives and American citizens against\r\nthe conduct of our agents in the island. In 1921 President Wilson was\r\nconsidering withdrawal.\r\n\r\nIn line with American policy in the West Indian waters was the purchase\r\nin 1917 of the Danish Islands just off the coast of Porto Rico. The\r\nstrategic position of the islands, especially in relation to Haiti and\r\nPorto Rico, made them an object of American concern as early as 1867,\r\nwhen a treaty of purchase was negotiated only to be rejected by the\r\nSenate of the United States. In 1902 a second arrangement was made, but\r\nthis time it was defeated by the upper house of the Danish parliament.\r\nThe third treaty brought an end to fifty years of bargaining and the\r\nStars and Stripes were raised over St. Croix, St. Thomas, St. John, and\r\nnumerous minor islands scattered about in the neighborhood. \"It would be\r\nsuicidal,\" commented a New York newspaper, \"for America, on the\r\nthreshold of a great commercial expansion in South America, to suffer a\r\nHeligoland, or a Gibraltar, or an Aden to be erected by her rivals at\r\nthe mouth of her Suez.\" On the mainland American power was strengthened\r\nby the establishment of a protectorate over Nicaragua in 1916.\r\n\r\n=Mexican Relations.=--The extension of American enterprise southward\r\ninto Latin America, of which the operations in the Caribbean regions\r\nwere merely one phase, naturally carried Americans into Mexico to\r\ndevelop the natural resources of that country. Under the iron rule of\r\nGeneral Porfirio Diaz, established in 1876 and maintained with only a\r\nshort break until 1911, Mexico had become increasingly attractive to our\r\nbusiness men. On the invitation of President Diaz, they had invested\r\nhuge sums in Mexican lands, oil fields, and mines, and had laid the\r\nfoundations of a new industrial order. The severe régime instituted by\r\nDiaz, however, stirred popular discontent. The peons, or serfs, demanded\r\nthe break-up of the great estates, some of which had come down from the\r\ndays of Cortez. Their clamor for \"the restoration of the land to the\r\npeople could not be silenced.\" In 1911 Diaz was forced to resign and\r\nleft the country.\r\n\r\nMexico now slid down the path to disorder. Revolutions and civil\r\ncommotions followed in swift succession. A liberal president, Madero,\r\ninstalled as the successor to Diaz, was deposed in 1913 and brutally\r\nmurdered. Huerta, a military adventurer, hailed for a time as another\r\n\"strong man,\" succeeded Madero whose murder he was accused of\r\ninstigating. Although Great Britain and nearly all the powers of Europe\r\naccepted the new government as lawful, the United States steadily\r\nwithheld recognition. In the meantime Mexico was torn by insurrections\r\nunder the leadership of Carranza, a friend of Madero, Villa, a bandit of\r\ngenerous pretensions, and Zapata, a radical leader of the peons. Without\r\nthe support of the United States, Huerta was doomed.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1914, the dictator resigned and fled from the capital,\r\nleaving the field to Carranza. For six years the new president,\r\nrecognized by the United States, held a precarious position which he\r\nvigorously strove to strengthen against various revolutionary movements.\r\nAt length in 1920, he too was deposed and murdered, and another military\r\nchieftain, Obregon, installed in power.\r\n\r\nThese events right at our door could not fail to involve the government\r\nof the United States. In the disorders many American citizens lost their\r\nlives. American property was destroyed and land owned by Americans was\r\nconfiscated. A new Mexican constitution, in effect nationalizing the\r\nnatural resources of the country, struck at the rights of foreign\r\ninvestors. Moreover the Mexican border was in constant turmoil. Even in\r\nthe last days of his administration, Mr. Taft felt compelled to issue a\r\nsolemn warning to the Mexican government protesting against the\r\nviolation of American rights.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson, soon after his inauguration, sent a commissioner to\r\nMexico to inquire into the situation. Although he declared a general\r\npolicy of \"watchful waiting,\" he twice came to blows with Mexican\r\nforces. In 1914 some American sailors at Tampico were arrested by a\r\nMexican officer; the Mexican government, although it immediately\r\nreleased the men, refused to make the required apology for the incident.\r\nAs a result President Wilson ordered the landing of American forces at\r\nVera Cruz and the occupation of the city. A clash of arms followed in\r\nwhich several Americans were killed. War seemed inevitable, but at this\r\njuncture the governments of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile tendered their\r\ngood offices as mediators. After a few weeks of negotiation, during\r\nwhich Huerta was forced out of power, American forces were withdrawn\r\nfrom Vera Cruz and the incident closed.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 a second break in amicable relations occurred. In the spring of\r\nthat year a band of Villa's men raided the town of Columbus, New Mexico,\r\nkilling several citizens and committing robberies. A punitive expedition\r\nunder the command of General Pershing was quickly sent out to capture\r\nthe offenders. Against the protests of President Carranza, American\r\nforces penetrated deeply into Mexico without effecting the object of\r\nthe undertaking. This operation lasted until January, 1917, when the\r\nimminence of war with Germany led to the withdrawal of the American\r\nsoldiers. Friendly relations were resumed with the Mexican government\r\nand the policy of \"watchful waiting\" was continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN WAR\r\n\r\n=The Outbreak of the War.=--In the opening days of August, 1914, the\r\nage-long jealousies of European nations, sharpened by new imperial\r\nambitions, broke out in another general conflict such as had shaken the\r\nworld in the days of Napoleon. On June 28, the heir to the\r\nAustro-Hungarian throne was assassinated at Serajevo, the capital of\r\nBosnia, an Austrian province occupied mainly by Serbs. With a view to\r\nstopping Serbian agitation for independence, Austria-Hungary laid the\r\nblame for this incident on the government of Serbia and made humiliating\r\ndemands on that country. Germany at once proposed that the issue should\r\nbe regarded as \"an affair which should be settled solely between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Serbia\"; meaning that the small nation should be\r\nleft to the tender mercies of a great power. Russia refused to take this\r\nview. Great Britain proposed a settlement by mediation. Germany backed\r\nup Austria to the limit. To use the language of the German authorities:\r\n\"We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of\r\nAustria-Hungary against Serbia might bring Russia upon the field and\r\nthat it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our\r\nduties as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of\r\nAustria-Hungary which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding\r\nattitude not compatible with his dignity nor deny him our assistance.\"\r\nThat made the war inevitable.\r\n\r\nEvery day of the fateful August, 1914, was crowded with momentous\r\nevents. On the 1st, Germany declared war on Russia. On the 2d, the\r\nGermans invaded the little duchy of Luxemburg and notified the King of\r\nBelgium that they were preparing to violate the neutrality of his realm\r\non their way to Paris. On the same day, Great Britain, anxiously\r\nbesought by the French government, promised the aid of the British navy\r\nif German warships made hostile demonstrations in the Channel. August\r\n3d, the German government declared war on France. The following day,\r\nGreat Britain demanded of Germany respect for Belgian neutrality and,\r\nfailing to receive the guarantee, broke off diplomatic relations. On the\r\n5th, the British prime minister announced that war had opened between\r\nEngland and Germany. The storm now broke in all its pitiless fury.\r\n\r\n=The State of American Opinion.=--Although President Wilson promptly\r\nproclaimed the neutrality of the United States, the sympathies of a\r\nlarge majority of the American people were without doubt on the side of\r\nGreat Britain and France. To them the invasion of the little kingdom of\r\nBelgium and the horrors that accompanied German occupation were odious\r\nin the extreme. Moreover, they regarded the German imperial government\r\nas an autocratic power wielded in the interest of an ambitious military\r\nparty. The Kaiser, William II, and the Crown Prince were the symbols of\r\nroyal arrogance. On the other hand, many Americans of German descent, in\r\nmemory of their ties with the Fatherland, openly sympathized with the\r\nCentral Powers; and many Americans of Irish descent, recalling their\r\nlong and bitter struggle for home rule in Ireland, would have regarded\r\nBritish defeat as a merited redress of ancient grievances.\r\n\r\nExtremely sensitive to American opinion, but ill informed about it, the\r\nGerman government soon began systematic efforts to present its cause to\r\nthe people of the United States in the most favorable light possible.\r\nDr. Bernhard Dernburg, the former colonial secretary of the German\r\nempire, was sent to America as a special agent. For months he filled the\r\nnewspapers, magazines, and periodicals with interviews, articles, and\r\nnotes on the justice of the Teutonic cause. From a press bureau in New\r\nYork flowed a stream of pamphlets, leaflets, and cartoons. A magazine,\r\n\"The Fatherland,\" was founded to secure \"fair play for Germany and\r\nAustria.\" Several professors in American universities, who had received\r\ntheir training in Germany, took up the pen in defense of the Central\r\nEmpires. The German language press, without exception it seems, the\r\nNational German Alliance, minor German societies, and Lutheran churches\r\ncame to the support of the German cause. Even the English language\r\npapers, though generally favorable to the Entente Allies, opened their\r\ncolumns in the interest of equal justice to the spokesmen for all the\r\ncontending powers of Europe.\r\n\r\nBefore two weeks had elapsed the controversy had become so intense that\r\nPresident Wilson (August 18, 1914) was moved to caution his countrymen\r\nagainst falling into angry disputes. \"Every man,\" he said, \"who really\r\nloves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality which\r\nis the spirit of impartiality and fairness and friendliness to all\r\nconcerned.... We must be impartial in thought as well as in action, must\r\nput a curb upon our sentiments as well as upon every transaction that\r\nmight be construed as a preference of one party to the struggle before\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n=The Clash over American Trade.=--As in the time of the Napoleonic wars,\r\nthe conflict in Europe raised fundamental questions respecting rights of\r\nAmericans trading with countries at peace as well as those at war. On\r\nthis point there existed on August 1, 1914, a fairly definite body of\r\nprinciples by which nations were bound. Among them the following were of\r\nvital significance. In the first place, it was recognized that an enemy\r\nmerchant ship caught on the high seas was a legitimate prize of war\r\nwhich might be seized and confiscated. In the second place, it was\r\nagreed that \"contraband of war\" found on an enemy or neutral ship was a\r\nlawful prize; any ship suspected of carrying it was liable to search and\r\nif caught with forbidden goods was subject to seizure. In the third\r\nplace, international law prescribed that a peaceful merchant ship,\r\nwhether belonging to an enemy or to a neutral country, should not be\r\ndestroyed or sunk without provision for the safety of crew and\r\npassengers. In the fourth place, it was understood that a belligerent\r\nhad the right, if it could, to blockade the ports of an enemy and\r\nprevent the ingress and egress of all ships; but such a blockade, to be\r\nlawful, had to be effective.\r\n\r\nThese general principles left undetermined two important matters: \"What\r\nis an effective blockade?\" and \"What is contraband of war?\" The task of\r\nanswering these questions fell to Great Britain as mistress of the seas.\r\nAlthough the German submarines made it impossible for her battleships to\r\nmaintain a continuous patrol of the waters in front of blockaded ports,\r\nshe declared the blockade to be none the less \"effective\" because her\r\nnavy was supreme. As to contraband of war Great Britain put such a broad\r\ninterpretation upon the term as to include nearly every important\r\narticle of commerce. Early in 1915 she declared even cargoes of grain\r\nand flour to be contraband, defending the action on the ground that the\r\nGerman government had recently taken possession of all domestic stocks\r\nof corn, wheat, and flour.\r\n\r\nA new question arose in connection with American trade with the neutral\r\ncountries surrounding Germany. Great Britain early began to intercept\r\nships carrying oil, gasoline, and copper--all war materials of prime\r\nimportance--on the ground that they either were destined ultimately to\r\nGermany or would release goods for sale to Germans. On November 2, 1914,\r\nthe English government announced that the Germans wore sowing mines in\r\nopen waters and that therefore the whole of the North Sea was a military\r\nzone. Ships bound for Denmark, Norway, and Sweden were ordered to come\r\nby the English Channel for inspection and sailing directions. In effect,\r\nAmericans were now licensed by Great Britain to trade in certain\r\ncommodities and in certain amounts with neutral countries.\r\n\r\nAgainst these extraordinary measures, the State Department at Washington\r\nlodged pointed objections, saying: \"This government is reluctantly\r\nforced to the conclusion that the present policy of His Majesty's\r\ngovernment toward neutral ships and cargoes exceeds the manifest\r\nnecessity of a belligerent and constitutes restrictions upon the rights\r\nof American citizens on the high seas, which are not justified by the\r\nrules of international law or required under the principle of\r\nself-preservation.\"\r\n\r\n=Germany Begins the Submarine Campaign.=--Germany now announced that, on\r\nand after February 18, 1915, the whole of the English Channel and the\r\nwaters around Great Britain would be deemed a war zone and that every\r\nenemy ship found therein would be destroyed. The German decree added\r\nthat, as the British admiralty had ordered the use of neutral flags by\r\nEnglish ships in time of distress, neutral vessels would be in danger of\r\ndestruction if found in the forbidden area. It was clear that Germany\r\nintended to employ submarines to destroy shipping. A new factor was thus\r\nintroduced into naval warfare, one not provided for in the accepted laws\r\nof war. A warship overhauling a merchant vessel could easily take its\r\ncrew and passengers on board for safe keeping as prescribed by\r\ninternational law; but a submarine ordinarily could do nothing of the\r\nsort. Of necessity the lives and the ships of neutrals, as well as of\r\nbelligerents, were put in mortal peril. This amazing conduct Germany\r\njustified on the ground that it was mere retaliation against Great\r\nBritain for her violations of international law.\r\n\r\nThe response of the United States to the ominous German order was swift\r\nand direct. On February 10, 1915, it warned Germany that if her\r\ncommanders destroyed American lives and ships in obedience to that\r\ndecree, the action would \"be very hard indeed to reconcile with the\r\nfriendly relations happily subsisting between the two governments.\" The\r\nAmerican note added that the German imperial government would be held to\r\n\"strict accountability\" and all necessary steps would be taken to\r\nsafeguard American lives and American rights. This was firm and clear\r\nlanguage, but the only response which it evoked from Germany was a\r\nsuggestion that, if Great Britain would allow food supplies to pass\r\nthrough the blockade, the submarine campaign would be dropped.\r\n\r\n=Violations of American Rights.=--Meanwhile Germany continued to ravage\r\nshipping on the high seas. On January 28, a German raider sank the\r\nAmerican ship, _William P. Frye_, in the South Atlantic; on March 28, a\r\nBritish ship, the _Falaba_, was sunk by a submarine and many on board,\r\nincluding an American citizen, were killed; and on April 28, a German\r\nairplane dropped bombs on the American steamer _Cushing_. On the morning\r\nof May 1, 1915, Americans were astounded to see in the newspapers an\r\nadvertisement, signed by the German Imperial Embassy, warning travelers\r\nof the dangers in the war zone and notifying them that any who ventured\r\non British ships into that area did so at their own risk. On that day,\r\nthe _Lusitania_, a British steamer, sailed from New York for Liverpool.\r\nOn May 7, without warning, the ship was struck by two torpedoes and in a\r\nfew minutes went down by the bow, carrying to death 1153 persons\r\nincluding 114 American men, women, and children. A cry of horror ran\r\nthrough the country. The German papers in America and a few American\r\npeople argued that American citizens had been duly warned of the danger\r\nand had deliberately taken their lives into their own hands; but the\r\nterrible deed was almost universally condemned by public opinion.\r\n\r\n=The _Lusitania_ Notes.=--On May 14, the Department of State at\r\nWashington made public the first of three famous notes on the\r\n_Lusitania_ case. It solemnly informed the German government that \"no\r\nwarning that an unlawful and inhumane act will be committed can possibly\r\nbe accepted as an excuse or palliation for that act or as an abatement\r\nof the responsibility for its commission.\" It called upon the German\r\ngovernment to disavow the act, make reparation as far as possible, and\r\ntake steps to prevent \"the recurrence of anything so obviously\r\nsubversive of the principles of warfare.\" The note closed with a clear\r\ncaution to Germany that the government of the United States would not\r\n\"omit any word or any act necessary to the performance of its sacred\r\nduty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its citizens and\r\nof safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\" The die was cast;\r\nbut Germany in reply merely temporized.\r\n\r\nIn a second note, made public on June 11, the position of the United\r\nStates was again affirmed. William Jennings Bryan, the Secretary of\r\nState, had resigned because the drift of President Wilson's policy was\r\nnot toward mediation but the strict maintenance of American rights, if\r\nneed be, by force of arms. The German reply was still evasive and German\r\nnaval commanders continued their course of sinking merchant ships. In a\r\nthird and final note of July 21, 1915, President Wilson made it clear to\r\nGermany that he meant what he said when he wrote that he would maintain\r\nthe rights of American citizens. Finally after much discussion and\r\nshifting about, the German ambassador on September 1, 1915, sent a brief\r\nnote to the Secretary of State: \"Liners will not be sunk by our\r\nsubmarines without warning and without safety of the lives of\r\nnon-combatants, provided the liners do not try to escape or offer\r\nresistance.\" Editorially, the New York _Times_ declared: \"It is a\r\ntriumph not only of diplomacy but of reason, of humanity, of justice,\r\nand of truth.\" The Secretary of State saw in it \"a recognition of the\r\nfundamental principles for which we have contended.\"\r\n\r\n=The Presidential Election of 1916.=--In the midst of this crisis came\r\nthe presidential campaign. On the Republican side everything seemed to\r\ndepend upon the action of the Progressives. If the breach created in\r\n1912 could be closed, victory was possible; if not, defeat was certain.\r\nA promise of unity lay in the fact that the conventions of the\r\nRepublicans and Progressives were held simultaneously in Chicago. The\r\nfriends of Roosevelt hoped that both parties would select him as their\r\ncandidate; but this hope was not realized. The Republicans chose, and\r\nthe Progressives accepted, Charles E. Hughes, an associate justice of\r\nthe federal Supreme Court who, as governor of New York, had won a\r\nnational reputation by waging war on \"machine politicians.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of the clamor for expressions of sympathy with one or the\r\nother of the contending powers of Europe, the Republicans chose a middle\r\ncourse, declaring that they would uphold all American rights \"at home\r\nand abroad, by land and by sea.\" This sentiment Mr. Hughes echoed in his\r\nacceptance speech. By some it was interpreted to mean a firmer policy in\r\ndealing with Great Britain; by others, a more vigorous handling of the\r\nsubmarine menace. The Democrats, on their side, renominated President\r\nWilson by acclamation, reviewed with pride the legislative achievements\r\nof the party, and commended \"the splendid diplomatic victories of our\r\ngreat President who has preserved the vital interests of our government\r\nand its citizens and kept us out of war.\"\r\n\r\nIn the election which ensued President Wilson's popular vote exceeded\r\nthat cast for Mr. Hughes by more than half a million, while his\r\nelectoral vote stood 277 to 254. The result was regarded, and not\r\nwithout warrant, as a great personal triumph for the President. He had\r\nreceived the largest vote yet cast for a presidential candidate. The\r\nProgressive party practically disappeared, and the Socialists suffered a\r\nsevere set-back, falling far behind the vote of 1912.\r\n\r\n=President Wilson Urges Peace upon the Warring Nations.=--Apparently\r\nconvinced that his pacific policies had been profoundly approved by his\r\ncountrymen, President Wilson, soon after the election, addressed \"peace\r\nnotes\" to the European belligerents. On December 16, the German Emperor\r\nproposed to the Allied Powers that they enter into peace negotiations, a\r\nsuggestion that was treated as a mere political maneuver by the opposing\r\ngovernments. Two days later President Wilson sent a note to the warring\r\nnations asking them to avow \"the terms upon which war might be\r\nconcluded.\" To these notes the Central Powers replied that they were\r\nready to meet their antagonists in a peace conference; and Allied Powers\r\nanswered by presenting certain conditions precedent to a satisfactory\r\nsettlement. On January 22, 1917, President Wilson in an address before\r\nthe Senate, declared it to be a duty of the United States to take part\r\nin the establishment of a stable peace on the basis of certain\r\nprinciples. These were, in short: \"peace without victory\"; the right of\r\nnationalities to freedom and self-government; the independence of\r\nPoland; freedom of the seas; the reduction of armaments; and the\r\nabolition of entangling alliances. The whole world was discussing the\r\nPresident's remarkable message, when it was dumbfounded to hear, on\r\nJanuary 31, that the German ambassador at Washington had announced the\r\nofficial renewal of ruthless submarine warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES AT WAR\r\n\r\n=Steps toward War.=--Three days after the receipt of the news that the\r\nGerman government intended to return to its former submarine policy,\r\nPresident Wilson severed diplomatic relations with the German empire. At\r\nthe same time he explained to Congress that he desired no conflict with\r\nGermany and would await an \"overt act\" before taking further steps to\r\npreserve American rights. \"God grant,\" he concluded, \"that we may not be\r\nchallenged to defend them by acts of willful injustice on the part of\r\nthe government of Germany.\" Yet the challenge came. Between February 26\r\nand April 2, six American merchant vessels were torpedoed, in most cases\r\nwithout any warning and without regard to the loss of American lives.\r\nPresident Wilson therefore called upon Congress to answer the German\r\nmenace. The reply of Congress on April 6 was a resolution, passed with\r\nonly a few dissenting votes, declaring the existence of a state of war\r\nwith Germany. Austria-Hungary at once severed diplomatic relations with\r\nthe United States; but it was not until December 7 that Congress, acting\r\non the President's advice, declared war also on that \"vassal of the\r\nGerman government.\"\r\n\r\n=American War Aims.=--In many addresses at the beginning and during the\r\ncourse of the war, President Wilson stated the purposes which actuated\r\nour government in taking up arms. He first made it clear that it was a\r\nwar of self-defense. \"The military masters of Germany,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\"denied us the right to be neutral.\" Proof of that lay on every hand.\r\nAgents of the German imperial government had destroyed American lives\r\nand American property on the high seas. They had filled our communities\r\nwith spies. They had planted bombs in ships and munition works. They had\r\nfomented divisions among American citizens.\r\n\r\nThough assailed in many ways and compelled to resort to war, the United\r\nStates sought no material rewards. \"The world must be made safe for\r\ndemocracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of\r\npolitical liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no\r\nconquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nIn a very remarkable message read to Congress on January 8, 1918,\r\nPresident Wilson laid down his famous \"fourteen points\" summarizing the\r\nideals for which we were fighting. They included open treaties of peace,\r\nopenly arrived at; absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas; the\r\nremoval, as far as possible, of trade barriers among nations; reduction\r\nof armaments; adjustment of colonial claims in the interest of the\r\npopulations concerned; fair and friendly treatment of Russia; the\r\nrestoration of Belgium; righting the wrong done to France in 1871 in the\r\nmatter of Alsace-Lorraine; adjustment of Italian frontiers along the\r\nlines of nationality; more liberty for the peoples of Austria-Hungary;\r\nthe restoration of Serbia and Rumania; the readjustment of the Turkish\r\nEmpire; an independent Poland; and an association of nations to afford\r\nmutual guarantees to all states great and small. On a later occasion\r\nPresident Wilson elaborated the last point, namely, the formation of a\r\nleague of nations to guarantee peace and establish justice among the\r\npowers of the world. Democracy, the right of nations to determine their\r\nown fate, a covenant of enduring peace--these were the ideals for which\r\nthe American people were to pour out their blood and treasure.\r\n\r\n=The Selective Draft.=--The World War became a war of nations. The\r\npowers against which we were arrayed had every able-bodied man in\r\nservice and all their resources, human and material, thrown into the\r\nscale. For this reason, President Wilson summoned the whole people of\r\nthe United States to make every sacrifice necessary for victory.\r\nCongress by law decreed that the national army should be chosen from all\r\nmale citizens and males not enemy aliens who had declared their\r\nintention of becoming citizens. By the first act of May 18, 1917, it\r\nfixed the age limits at twenty-one to thirty-one inclusive. Later, in\r\nAugust, 1918, it extended them to eighteen and forty-five. From the men\r\nof the first group so enrolled were chosen by lot the soldiers for the\r\nWorld War who, with the regular army and the national guard, formed the\r\nAmerican Expeditionary Force upholding the American cause on the\r\nbattlefields of Europe. \"The whole nation,\" said the President, \"must be\r\na team in which each man shall play the part for which he is best\r\nfitted.\"\r\n\r\n=Liberty Loans and Taxes.=--In order that the military and naval forces\r\nshould be stinted in no respect, the nation was called upon to place its\r\nfinancial resources at the service of the government. Some urged the\r\n\"conscription of wealth as well as men,\" meaning the support of the war\r\nout of taxes upon great fortunes; but more conservative counsels\r\nprevailed. Four great Liberty Loans were floated, all the agencies of\r\nmodern publicity being employed to enlist popular interest. The first\r\nloan had four and a half million subscribers; the fourth more than\r\ntwenty million. Combined with loans were heavy taxes. A progressive tax\r\nwas laid upon incomes beginning with four per cent on incomes in the\r\nlower ranges and rising to sixty-three per cent of that part of any\r\nincome above $2,000,000. A progressive tax was levied upon inheritances.\r\nAn excess profits tax was laid upon all corporations and partnerships,\r\nrising in amount to sixty per cent of the net income in excess of\r\nthirty-three per cent on the invested capital. \"This,\" said a\r\ndistinguished economist, \"is the high-water mark in the history of\r\ntaxation. Never before in the annals of civilization has an attempt been\r\nmade to take as much as two-thirds of a man's income by taxation.\"\r\n\r\n=Mobilizing Material Resources.=--No stone was left unturned to provide\r\nthe arms, munitions, supplies, and transportation required in the\r\ngigantic undertaking. Between the declaration of war and the armistice,\r\nCongress enacted law after law relative to food supplies, raw materials,\r\nrailways, mines, ships, forests, and industrial enterprises. No power\r\nover the lives and property of citizens, deemed necessary to the\r\nprosecution of the armed conflict, was withheld from the government. The\r\nfarmer's wheat, the housewife's sugar, coal at the mines, labor in the\r\nfactories, ships at the wharves, trade with friendly countries, the\r\nrailways, banks, stores, private fortunes--all were mobilized and laid\r\nunder whatever obligations the government deemed imperative. Never was a\r\nnation more completely devoted to a single cause.\r\n\r\nA law of August 10, 1917, gave the President power to fix the prices of\r\nwheat and coal and to take almost any steps necessary to prevent\r\nmonopoly and excessive prices. By a series of measures, enlarging the\r\nprinciples of the shipping act of 1916, ships and shipyards were brought\r\nunder public control and the government was empowered to embark upon a\r\ngreat ship-building program. In December, 1917, the government assumed\r\nfor the period of the war the operation of the railways under a\r\npresidential proclamation which was elaborated in March, 1918, by act of\r\nCongress. In the summer of 1918 the express, telephone, and telegraph\r\nbusiness of the entire country passed under government control. By war\r\nrisk insurance acts allowances were made for the families of enlisted\r\nmen, compensation for injuries was provided, death benefits were\r\ninstituted, and a system of national insurance was established in the\r\ninterest of the men in service. Never before in the history of the\r\ncountry had the government taken such a wise and humane view of its\r\nobligations to those who served on the field of battle or on the seas.\r\n\r\n=The Espionage and Sedition Acts.=--By the Espionage law of June 15,\r\n1917, and the amending law, known as the Sedition act, passed in May of\r\nthe following year, the government was given a drastic power over the\r\nexpression of opinion. The first measure penalized those who conveyed\r\ninformation to a foreign country to be used to the injury of the United\r\nStates; those who made false statements designed to interfere with the\r\nmilitary or naval forces of the United States; those who attempted to\r\nstir up insubordination or disloyalty in the army and navy; and those\r\nwho willfully obstructed enlistment. The Sedition act was still more\r\nsevere and sweeping in its terms. It imposed heavy penalties upon any\r\nperson who used \"abusive language about the government or institutions\r\nof the country.\" It authorized the dismissal of any officer of the\r\ngovernment who committed \"disloyal acts\" or uttered \"disloyal language,\"\r\nand empowered the Postmaster General to close the mails to persons\r\nviolating the law. This measure, prepared by the Department of Justice,\r\nencountered vigorous opposition in the Senate, where twenty-four\r\nRepublicans and two Democrats voted against it. Senator Johnson of\r\nCalifornia denounced it as a law \"to suppress the freedom of the press\r\nin the United States and to prevent any man, no matter who he is, from\r\nexpressing legitimate criticism concerning the present government.\" The\r\nconstitutionality of the acts was attacked; but they were sustained by\r\nthe Supreme Court and stringently enforced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nTHE LAUNCHING OF A SHIP AT THE GREAT NAVAL YARDS, NEWARK, N.J.]\r\n\r\n=Labor and the War.=--In view of the restlessness of European labor\r\nduring the war and especially the proletarian revolution in Russia in\r\nNovember, 1917, some anxiety was early expressed as to the stand which\r\norganized labor might take in the United States. It was, however, soon\r\ndispelled. Samuel Gompers, speaking for the American Federation of\r\nLabor, declared that \"this is labor's war,\" and pledged the united\r\nsupport of all the unions. There was some dissent. The Socialist party\r\ndenounced the war as a capitalist quarrel; but all the protests combined\r\nwere too slight to have much effect. American labor leaders were sent to\r\nEurope to strengthen the wavering ranks of trade unionists in war-worn\r\nEngland, France, and Italy. Labor was given representation on the\r\nimportant boards and commissions dealing with industrial questions.\r\nTrade union standards were accepted by the government and generally\r\napplied in industry. The Department of Labor became one of the powerful\r\nwar centers of the nation. In a memorable address to the American\r\nFederation of Labor, President Wilson assured the trade unionists that\r\nlabor conditions should not be made unduly onerous by the war and\r\nreceived in return a pledge of loyalty from the Federation. Recognition\r\nof labor's contribution to winning the war was embodied in the treaty of\r\npeace, which provided for a permanent international organization to\r\npromote the world-wide effort of labor to improve social conditions.\r\n\"The league of nations has for its object the establishment of universal\r\npeace,\" runs the preamble to the labor section of the treaty, \"and such\r\na peace can be established only if it is based upon social justice....\r\nThe failure of any nation to adopt humane conditions of labor is an\r\nobstacle in the way of other nations which desire to improve the\r\nconditions in their own countries.\"\r\n\r\n=The American Navy in the War.=--As soon as Congress declared war the\r\nfleet was mobilized, American ports were thrown open to the warships of\r\nthe Allies, immediate provision was made for increasing the number of\r\nmen and ships, and a contingent of war vessels was sent to coöperate\r\nwith the British and French in their life-and-death contest with\r\nsubmarines. Special effort was made to stimulate the production of\r\n\"submarine chasers\" and \"scout cruisers\" to be sent to the danger zone.\r\nConvoys were provided to accompany the transports conveying soldiers to\r\nFrance. Before the end of the war more than three hundred American\r\nvessels and 75,000 officers and men were operating in European waters.\r\nThough the German fleet failed to come out and challenge the sea power\r\nof the Allies, the battleships of the United States were always ready to\r\ndo their full duty in such an event. As things turned out, the service\r\nof the American navy was limited mainly to helping in the campaign that\r\nwore down the submarine menace to Allied shipping.\r\n\r\n=The War in France.=--Owing to the peculiar character of the warfare in\r\nFrance, it required a longer time for American military forces to get\r\ninto action; but there was no unnecessary delay. Soon after the\r\ndeclaration of war, steps were taken to give military assistance to the\r\nAllies. The regular army was enlarged and the troops of the national\r\nguard were brought into national service. On June 13, General John J.\r\nPershing, chosen head of the American Expeditionary Forces, reached\r\nParis and began preparations for the arrival of our troops. In June, the\r\nvanguard of the army reached France. A slow and steady stream followed.\r\nAs soon as the men enrolled under the draft were ready, it became a\r\nflood. During the period of the war the army was enlarged from about\r\n190,000 men to 3,665,000, of whom more than 2,000,000 were in France\r\nwhen the armistice was signed.\r\n\r\nAlthough American troops did not take part on a large scale until the\r\nlast phase of the war in 1918, several battalions of infantry were in\r\nthe trenches by October, 1917, and had their first severe encounter with\r\nthe Germans early in November. In January, 1918, they took over a part\r\nof the front line as an American sector. In March, General Pershing\r\nplaced our forces at the disposal of General Foch, commander-in-chief of\r\nthe Allied armies. The first division, which entered the Montdidier\r\nsalient in April, soon was engaged with the enemy, \"taking with splendid\r\ndash the town of Cantigny and all other objectives, which were organized\r\nand held steadfastly against vicious counter attacks and galling\r\nartillery fire.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Copyright by Underwood and Underwood, N.Y._\r\n\r\nTROOPS RETURNING FROM FRANCE]\r\n\r\nWhen the Germans launched their grand drives toward the Marne and Paris,\r\nin June and July, 1918, every available man was placed at General Foch's\r\ncommand. At Belleau Wood, at Château-Thierry, and other points along the\r\ndeep salient made by the Germans into the French lines, American\r\nsoldiers distinguished themselves by heroic action. They also played an\r\nimportant rôle in the counter attack that \"smashed\" the salient and\r\ndrove the Germans back.\r\n\r\nIn September, American troops, with French aid, \"wiped out\" the German\r\nsalient at St. Mihiel. By this time General Pershing was ready for the\r\ngreat American drive to the northeast in the Argonne forest, while he\r\nalso coöperated with the British in the assault on the Hindenburg line.\r\nIn the Meuse-Argonne battle, our soldiers encountered some of the most\r\nsevere fighting of the war and pressed forward steadily against the most\r\nstubborn resistance from the enemy. On the 6th of November, reported\r\nGeneral Pershing, \"a division of the first corps reached a point on the\r\nMeuse opposite Sedan, twenty-five miles from our line of departure. The\r\nstrategical goal which was our highest hope was gained. We had cut the\r\nenemy's main line of communications and nothing but a surrender or an\r\narmistice could save his army from complete disaster.\" Five days later\r\nthe end came. On the morning of November 11, the order to cease firing\r\nwent into effect. The German army was in rapid retreat and\r\ndemoralization had begun. The Kaiser had abdicated and fled into\r\nHolland. The Hohenzollern dreams of empire were shattered. In the\r\nfifty-second month, the World War, involving nearly every civilized\r\nnation on the globe, was brought to a close. More than 75,000 American\r\nsoldiers and sailors had given their lives. More than 250,000 had been\r\nwounded or were missing or in German prison camps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WESTERN BATTLE LINES OF THE VARIOUS YEARS OF THE\r\nWORLD WAR]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SETTLEMENT AT PARIS\r\n\r\n=The Peace Conference.=--On January 18, 1919, a conference of the Allied\r\nand Associated Powers assembled to pronounce judgment upon the German\r\nempire and its defeated satellites: Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and\r\nTurkey. It was a moving spectacle. Seventy-two delegates spoke for\r\nthirty-two states. The United States, Great Britain, France, Italy, and\r\nJapan had five delegates each. Belgium, Brazil, and Serbia were each\r\nassigned three. Canada, Australia, South Africa, India, China, Greece,\r\nHedjaz, Poland, Portugal, Rumania, Siam, and Czechoslovakia were\r\nallotted two apiece. The remaining states of New Zealand, Bolivia, Cuba,\r\nEcuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru,\r\nand Uruguay each had one delegate. President Wilson spoke in person for\r\nthe United States. England, France, and Italy were represented by their\r\npremiers: David Lloyd George, Georges Clémenceau, and Vittorio Orlando.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREMIERS LLOYD GEORGE, ORLANDO AND CLÉMENCEAU AND\r\nPRESIDENT WILSON AT PARIS]\r\n\r\n=The Supreme Council.=--The real work of the settlement was first\r\ncommitted to a Supreme Council of ten representing the United States,\r\nGreat Britain, France, Italy, and Japan. This was later reduced to five\r\nmembers. Then Japan dropped out and finally Italy, leaving only\r\nPresident Wilson and the Premiers, Lloyd George and Clémenceau, the\r\n\"Big Three,\" who assumed the burden of mighty decisions. On May 6, their\r\nwork was completed and in a secret session of the full conference the\r\nwhole treaty of peace was approved, though a few of the powers made\r\nreservations or objections. The next day the treaty was presented to the\r\nGermans who, after prolonged protests, signed on the last day of grace,\r\nJune 28. This German treaty was followed by agreements with Austria,\r\nHungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. Collectively these great documents formed\r\nthe legal basis of the general European settlement.\r\n\r\n=The Terms of the Settlement.=--The combined treaties make a huge\r\nvolume. The German treaty alone embraces about 80,000 words.\r\nCollectively they cover an immense range of subjects which may be\r\nsummarized under five heads: (1) The territorial settlement in Europe;\r\n(2) the destruction of German military power; (3) reparations for\r\ndamages done by Germany and her allies; (4) the disposition of German\r\ncolonies and protectorates; and (5) the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nGermany was reduced by the cession of Alsace-Lorraine to France and the\r\nloss of several other provinces. Austria-Hungary was dissolved and\r\ndismembered. Russia was reduced by the creation of new states on the\r\nwest. Bulgaria was stripped of her gains in the recent Balkan wars.\r\nTurkey was dismembered. Nine new independent states were created:\r\nPoland, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Esthonia, Ukraine, Czechoslovakia,\r\nArmenia, and Hedjaz. Italy, Greece, Rumania, and Serbia were enlarged by\r\ncessions of territory and Serbia was transformed into the great state of\r\nJugoslavia.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of German military power was thorough. The entire navy,\r\nwith minor exceptions, was turned over to the Allied and Associated\r\nPowers; Germany's total equipment for the future was limited to six\r\nbattleships and six light cruisers, with certain small vessels but no\r\nsubmarines. The number of enlisted men and officers for the army was\r\nfixed at not more than 100,000; the General Staff was dissolved; and the\r\nmanufacture of munitions restricted.\r\n\r\nGermany was compelled to accept full responsibility for all damages; to\r\npay five billion dollars in cash and goods, and to make certain other\r\npayments which might be ordered from time to time by an inter-allied\r\nreparations commission. She was also required to deliver to Belgium,\r\nFrance, and Italy, millions of tons of coal every year for ten years;\r\nwhile by way of additional compensation to France the rich coal basin of\r\nthe Saar was placed under inter-allied control to be exploited under\r\nFrench administration for a period of at least fifteen years. Austria\r\nand the other associates of Germany were also laid under heavy\r\nobligations to the victors. Damages done to shipping by submarines and\r\nother vessels were to be paid for on the basis of ton for ton.\r\n\r\nThe disposition of the German colonies and the old Ottoman empire\r\npresented knotty problems. It was finally agreed that the German\r\ncolonies and Turkish provinces which were in a backward stage of\r\ndevelopment should be placed under the tutelage of certain powers acting\r\nas \"mandatories\" holding them in \"a sacred trust of civilization.\" An\r\nexception to the mandatory principle arose in the case of German rights\r\nin Shantung, all of which were transferred directly to Japan. It was\r\nthis arrangement that led the Chinese delegation to withhold their\r\nsignatures from the treaty.\r\n\r\n=The League of Nations.=--High among the purposes which he had in mind\r\nin summoning the nation to arms, President Wilson placed the desire to\r\nput an end to war. All through the United States the people spoke of the\r\n\"war to end war.\" No slogan called forth a deeper response from the\r\npublic. The President himself repeatedly declared that a general\r\nassociation of nations must be formed to guard the peace and protect all\r\nagainst the ambitions of the few. \"As I see it,\" he said in his address\r\non opening the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign, \"the constitution of the\r\nLeague of Nations and the clear definition of its objects must be a\r\npart, in a sense the most essential part, of the peace settlement\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\nNothing was more natural, therefore, than Wilson's insistence at Paris\r\nupon the formation of an international association. Indeed he had gone\r\nto Europe in person largely to accomplish that end. Part One of the\r\ntreaty with Germany, the Covenant of the League of Nations, was due to\r\nhis labors more than to any other influence. Within the League thus\r\ncreated were to be embraced all the Allied and Associated Powers and\r\nnearly all the neutrals. By a two-thirds vote of the League Assembly the\r\nexcluded nations might be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe agencies of the League of Nations were to be three in number: (1) a\r\npermanent secretariat located at Geneva; (2) an Assembly consisting of\r\none delegate from each country, dominion, or self-governing colony\r\n(including Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and India); (3)\r\nand a Council consisting of representatives of the United States, Great\r\nBritain, France, Italy, and Japan, and four other representatives\r\nselected by the Assembly from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe duties imposed on the League and the obligations accepted by its\r\nmembers were numerous and important. The Council was to take steps to\r\nformulate a scheme for the reduction of armaments and to submit a plan\r\nfor the establishment of a permanent Court of International Justice. The\r\nmembers of the League (Article X) were to respect and preserve as\r\nagainst external aggression the territorial integrity and existing\r\npolitical independence of all the associated nations. They were to\r\nsubmit to arbitration or inquiry by the Council all disputes which could\r\nnot be adjusted by diplomacy and in no case to resort to war until three\r\nmonths after the award. Should any member disregard its covenants, its\r\naction would be considered an act of war against the League, which would\r\naccordingly cut off the trade and business of the hostile member and\r\nrecommend through the Council to the several associated governments the\r\nmilitary measures to be taken. In case the decision in any arbitration\r\nof a dispute was unanimous, the members of the League affected by it\r\nwere to abide by it.\r\n\r\nSuch was the settlement at Paris and such was the association of nations\r\nformed to promote the peace of the world. They were quickly approved by\r\nmost of the powers, and the first Assembly of the League of Nations met\r\nat Geneva late in 1920.\r\n\r\n=The Treaty in the United States.=--When the treaty was presented to the\r\nUnited States Senate for approval, a violent opposition appeared. In\r\nthat chamber the Republicans had a slight majority and a two-thirds vote\r\nwas necessary for ratification. The sentiment for and against the treaty\r\nran mainly along party lines; but the Republicans were themselves\r\ndivided. The major portion, known as \"reservationists,\" favored\r\nratification with certain conditions respecting American rights; while a\r\nsmall though active minority rejected the League of Nations in its\r\nentirety, announcing themselves to be \"irreconcilables.\" The grounds of\r\nthis Republican opposition lay partly in the terms of peace imposed on\r\nGermany and partly in the Covenant of the League of Nations. Exception\r\nwas taken to the clauses which affected the rights of American citizens\r\nin property involved in the adjustment with Germany, but the burden of\r\ncriticism was directed against the League. Article X guaranteeing\r\nagainst external aggression the political independence and territorial\r\nintegrity of the members of the League was subjected to a specially\r\nheavy fire; while the treatment accorded to China and the sections\r\naffecting American internal affairs were likewise attacked as \"unjust\r\nand dangerous.\" As an outcome of their deliberations, the Republicans\r\nproposed a long list of reservations which touched upon many of the\r\nvital parts of the treaty. These were rejected by President Wilson as\r\namounting in effect to a \"nullification of the treaty.\" As a deadlock\r\nensued the treaty was definitely rejected, owing to the failure of its\r\nsponsors to secure the requisite two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPE]\r\n\r\n=The League of Nations in the Campaign of 1920.=--At this juncture the\r\npresidential campaign of 1920 opened. The Republicans, while condemning\r\nthe terms of the proposed League, endorsed the general idea of an\r\ninternational agreement to prevent war. Their candidate, Senator\r\nWarren G. Harding of Ohio, maintained a similar position without saying\r\ndefinitely whether the League devised at Paris could be recast in such a\r\nmanner as to meet his requirements. The Democrats, on the other hand,\r\nwhile not opposing limitations clarifying the obligations of the United\r\nStates, demanded \"the immediate ratification of the treaty without\r\nreservations which would impair its essential integrity.\" The Democratic\r\ncandidate, Governor James M. Cox, of Ohio, announced his firm conviction\r\nthat the United States should \"go into the League,\" without closing the\r\ndoor to mild reservations; he appealed to the country largely on that\r\nissue. The election of Senator Harding, in an extraordinary \"landslide,\"\r\ncoupled with the return of a majority of Republicans to the Senate, made\r\nuncertain American participation in the League of Nations.\r\n\r\n=The United States and International Entanglements.=--Whether America\r\nentered the League or not, it could not close its doors to the world and\r\nescape perplexing international complications. It had ever-increasing\r\nfinancial and commercial connections with all other countries. Our\r\nassociates in the recent war were heavily indebted to our government.\r\nThe prosperity of American industries depended to a considerable extent\r\nupon the recovery of the impoverished and battle-torn countries of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThere were other complications no less specific. The United States was\r\ncompelled by force of circumstances to adopt a Russian policy. The\r\ngovernment of the Czar had been overthrown by a liberal revolution,\r\nwhich in turn had been succeeded by an extreme, communist\r\n\"dictatorship.\" The Bolsheviki, or majority faction of the socialists,\r\nhad obtained control of the national council of peasants, workingmen,\r\nand soldiers, called the soviet, and inaugurated a radical régime. They\r\nhad made peace with Germany in March, 1918. Thereupon the United States\r\njoined England, France, and Japan in an unofficial war upon them. After\r\nthe general settlement at Paris in 1919, our government, while\r\nwithdrawing troops from Siberia and Archangel, continued in its refusal\r\nto recognize the Bolshevists or to permit unhampered trade with them.\r\nPresident Wilson repeatedly denounced them as the enemies of\r\ncivilization and undertook to lay down for all countries the principles\r\nwhich should govern intercourse with Russia.\r\n\r\nFurther international complications were created in connection with the\r\nWorld War, wholly apart from the terms of peace or the League of\r\nNations. The United States had participated in a general European\r\nconflict which changed the boundaries of countries, called into being\r\nnew nations, and reduced the power and territories of the vanquished.\r\nAccordingly, it was bound to face the problem of how far it was prepared\r\nto coöperate with the victors in any settlement of Europe's\r\ndifficulties. By no conceivable process, therefore, could America be\r\ndisentangled from the web of world affairs. Isolation, if desirable, had\r\nbecome impossible. Within three hundred years from the founding of the\r\ntiny settlements at Jamestown and Plymouth, America, by virtue of its\r\ninstitutions, its population, its wealth, and its commerce, had become\r\nfirst among the nations of the earth. By moral obligations and by\r\npractical interests its fate was thus linked with the destiny of all\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF DEMOCRACY AND THE WORLD WAR\r\n\r\nThe astounding industrial progress that characterized the period\r\nfollowing the Civil War bequeathed to the new generation many perplexing\r\nproblems connected with the growth of trusts and railways, the\r\naccumulation of great fortunes, the increase of poverty in the\r\nindustrial cities, the exhaustion of the free land, and the acquisition\r\nof dominions in distant seas. As long as there was an abundance of land\r\nin the West any able-bodied man with initiative and industry could\r\nbecome an independent farmer. People from the cities and immigrants from\r\nEurope had always before them that gateway to property and prosperity.\r\nWhen the land was all gone, American economic conditions inevitably\r\nbecame more like those of Europe.\r\n\r\nThough the new economic questions had been vigorously debated in many\r\ncircles before his day, it was President Roosevelt who first discussed\r\nthem continuously from the White House. The natural resources of the\r\ncountry were being exhausted; he advocated their conservation. Huge\r\nfortunes were being made in business creating inequalities in\r\nopportunity; he favored reducing them by income and inheritance taxes.\r\nIndustries were disturbed by strikes; he pressed arbitration upon\r\ncapital and labor. The free land was gone; he declared that labor was in\r\na less favorable position to bargain with capital and therefore should\r\norganize in unions for collective bargaining. There had been wrong-doing\r\non the part of certain great trusts; those responsible should be\r\npunished.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of reform was abroad in the land. The spoils system was\r\nattacked. It was alleged that the political parties were dominated by\r\n\"rings and bosses.\" The United States Senate was called \"a millionaires'\r\nclub.\" Poverty and misery were observed in the cities. State\r\nlegislatures and city governments were accused of corruption.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the charges, remedies were proposed and adopted. Civil\r\nservice reform was approved. The Australian ballot, popular election of\r\nSenators, the initiative, referendum, and recall, commission and city\r\nmanager plans for cities, public regulation of railways, compensation\r\nfor those injured in industries, minimum wages for women and children,\r\npensions for widows, the control of housing in the cities--these and a\r\nhundred other reforms were adopted and tried out. The national watchword\r\nbecame: \"America, Improve Thyself.\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of reform broke into both political parties. It appeared in\r\nmany statutes enacted by Congress under President Taft's leadership. It\r\ndisrupted the Republicans temporarily in 1912 when the Progressive party\r\nentered the field. It led the Democratic candidate in that year,\r\nGovernor Wilson, to make a \"progressive appeal\" to the voters. It\r\ninspired a considerable program of national legislation under President\r\nWilson's two administrations.\r\n\r\nIn the age of change, four important amendments to the federal\r\nconstitution, the first in more than forty years, were adopted. The\r\nsixteenth empowered Congress to lay an income tax. The seventeenth\r\nassured popular election of Senators. The eighteenth made prohibition\r\nnational. The nineteenth, following upon the adoption of woman suffrage\r\nin many states, enfranchised the women of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of industry, equally great changes took place. The major\r\nportion of the nation's business passed into the hands of corporations.\r\nIn all the leading industries of the country labor was organized into\r\ntrade unions and federated in a national organization. The power of\r\norganized capital and organized labor loomed upon the horizon. Their\r\nstruggles, their rights, and their place in the economy of the nation\r\nraised problems of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nWhile the country was engaged in a heated debate upon its domestic\r\nissues, the World War broke out in Europe in 1914. As a hundred years\r\nbefore, American rights upon the high seas became involved at once. They\r\nwere invaded on both sides; but Germany, in addition to assailing\r\nAmerican ships and property, ruthlessly destroyed American lives. She\r\nset at naught the rules of civilized warfare upon the sea. Warnings from\r\nPresident Wilson were without avail. Nothing could stay the hand of the\r\nGerman war party.\r\n\r\nAfter long and patient negotiations, President Wilson in 1917 called\r\nupon the nation to take up arms against an assailant that had in effect\r\ndeclared war upon America. The answer was swift and firm. The national\r\nresources, human and material, were mobilized. The navy was enlarged, a\r\ndraft army created, huge loans floated, heavy taxes laid, and the spirit\r\nof sacrifice called forth in a titanic struggle against an autocratic\r\npower that threatened to dominate Europe and the World.\r\n\r\nIn the end, American financial, naval, and military assistance counted\r\nheavily in the scale. American sailors scoured the seas searching for\r\nthe terrible submarines. American soldiers took part in the last great\r\ndrives that broke the might of Germany's army. Such was the nation's\r\nresponse to the President's summons to arms in a war \"for democracy\" and\r\n\"to end war.\"\r\n\r\nWhen victory crowned the arms of the powers united against Germany,\r\nPresident Wilson in person took part in the peace council. He sought to\r\nredeem his pledge to end wars by forming a League of Nations to keep the\r\npeace. In the treaty drawn at the close of the war the first part was a\r\ncovenant binding the nations in a permanent association for the\r\nsettlement of international disputes. This treaty, the President offered\r\nto the United States Senate for ratification and to his country for\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nOnce again, as in the days of the Napoleonic wars, the people seriously\r\ndiscussed the place of America among the powers of the earth. The Senate\r\nrefused to ratify the treaty. World politics then became an issue in the\r\ncampaign of 1920. Though some Americans talked as if the United States\r\ncould close its doors and windows against all mankind, the victor in the\r\nelection, Senator Harding, of Ohio, knew better. The election returns\r\nwere hardly announced before he began to ask the advice of his\r\ncountrymen on the pressing theme that would not be downed: \"What part\r\nshall America--first among the nations of the earth in wealth and\r\npower--assume at the council table of the world?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=General References=\r\n\r\nWoodrow Wilson, _The New Freedom_.\r\n\r\nC.L.

The topical method, however,\r\nmay also be pushed too far. Each successive stage of any topic can be\r\nunderstood only in relation to the forces of the time. For that reason,\r\nthe best results are reached when there is a combination of the\r\nchronological and the topical methods. It is therefore suggested that\r\nthe teacher first follow the text closely and then review the subject\r\nwith the aid of this topical syllabus. The references are to pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Immigration=\r\n\r\n     I. Causes: religious (1-2, 4-11, 302), economic (12-17, 302-303),\r\n        and political (302-303).\r\n     II.
