Decker\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many ways the story of the survey and first settlement of Cleveland has\r\nbeen made familiar to the public. It has been told at pioneer gatherings,\r\nreproduced in newspapers and periodicals, enlarged upon in directory\r\nprefaces and condensed for works of topographical reference. Within a\r\nshort time Col. Charles Whittlesey has gathered up, collected, and\r\narranged the abundant materials for the Early History of Cleveland in a\r\nhandsome volume bearing that title.\r\n\r\nBut Col. Whittlesy's volume closes with the war of 1812, when Cleveland\r\nwas still a pioneer settlement with but a few families. The history of the\r\ngrowth of that settlement to a village, its development into a commercial\r\nport, and then into a large and flourishing city, with a busy population\r\nof a hundred thousand persons, remained mostly unwritten, and no part of\r\nit existing in permanent form. The whole period is covered by the active\r\nlives of men yet with us who have grown up with the place, and with whose\r\nhistory that of the city is inseparably connected. It occurred to the\r\nprojector of this work that a history of Cleveland could be written in the\r\nindividual histories of its representative men, that such a volume would\r\nnot only be a reliable account of the growth of the city in its general\r\nfeatures and in the development of its several branches of industry, but\r\nwould possess the additional advantage of the interest attaching to\r\npersonal narrative. This idea has been faithfully worked out in the\r\nfollowing pages, not without much labor and difficulty in the collection\r\nand arrangement of the materials. Besides the personal narratives, an\r\nintroductory sketch to each of the departments of business into which the\r\nbiographical sketches are grouped gives a brief account of the rise and\r\npresent position of that particular industry; these, taken together,\r\nforming a full and accurate business and professional history of the city.\r\nAn introductory sketch of the general history of Cleveland gives\r\ncompleteness to the whole, whilst the numerous illustrations and portraits\r\nadd greatly to the interest and value of the work.\r\n\r\nNumerous as are the sketches, it is not, of course, claimed that all are\r\nrepresented in the volume who deserve a place in it. This would be\r\nimpossible in a work of ordinary dimensions, even were it convenient, or\r\neven possible, to obtain the necessary materials. The aim has been to\r\nsketch sufficient of the representative men in each leading business and\r\nprofessional department to give a fair idea of the nature and extent of\r\nthat department. It is not a complete biographical dictionary of\r\nCleveland, but a volume of biographical selections, made, as the lawyers\r\nsay, \"without prejudice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the records of the first sixteen or seventeen years of the history of\r\nCleveland, what may be styled its pioneer history, the local historian\r\nwill hereafter be indebted to the work of Col. Whittlesey, where every\r\nknown and reliable fact connected with that period of Cleveland's history\r\nis carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nThe city was originally comprised in lands purchased by the \"Connecticut\r\nLand Company,\" and formed a portion of what is termed the Western Reserve.\r\nThis company was organized in 1795, and in the month of May of the\r\nfollowing year, it commissioned General Moses Cleaveland to superintend\r\nthe survey of their lands, with a staff of forty-eight assistants. On the\r\n22d of July, 1796, General Cleaveland, accompanied by Augustus Porter, the\r\nprincipal of the surveying department, and several others, entered the\r\nmouth of the Cuyahoga from the lake. Job P. Stiles and his wife are\r\nsupposed to have been with the party. General Cleaveland continued his\r\nprogress to Sandusky Bay, leaving enough men to put up a storehouse for\r\nthe supplies, and a cabin for the accommodation of the surveyors. These\r\nwere located a short distance south of St. Clair street, west of Union\r\nlane, at a spring in the side-hill, in rear of Scott's warehouse. During\r\nthe season a cabin was put up for Stiles, on lot 53, east side of Bank\r\nstreet, north of the Herald Building, where Morgan & Root's block now\r\nstands. This was the first building for permanent settlement erected on\r\nthe site of the city, although huts for temporary occupancy had been\r\npreviously built in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of the party from Sandusky, Mr. Porter prepared the\r\noutlines of the city. He says: \"I surveyed a piece of land designed for a\r\ntown--its dimensions I do not recollect--probably equal to about a mile\r\nsquare, bounding west on the river, and north on the lake. I made a plot\r\nof this ground, and laid it off into streets and lots. Most or all the\r\nstreets I surveyed myself, when I left it in charge of Mr. Holley to\r\ncomplete the survey of the lots.\"\r\n\r\nThe survey of the city was commenced on the 16th of September, and\r\ncompleted about the 1st of October, 1796. Holley's notes state that on\r\nMonday, October 17th, he \"finished surveying in New Connecticut; weather\r\nrainy,\" and on the following day he records: \"We left Cuyahoga at 3\r\no'clock 17 minutes, for home. We left at Cuyahoga, Job Stiles and wife,\r\nand Joseph Landon, with provisions for the Winter.\" Landon soon abandoned\r\nthe spot and his place was taken by Edward Paine, who had arrived from the\r\nState of New York, for the purpose of trading with the Indians, and who\r\nmay be considered the first mercantile man who transacted business in\r\nCleveland. Thus, during the Winter of 1796-7, the population of the city\r\nconsisted of three inhabitants. During the Winter a child is reputed to\r\nhave been born in the cabin, which had only squaws for nurses.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Spring of 1797, James Kingsbury and family, from New England,\r\nwith Elijah Gunn, one of the surveying party, all of whom had continued\r\nduring the Winter at Conneaut, where they had endured incredible\r\nhardships, removed to Cleveland. His first cabin was put up on the site of\r\nthe Case Block, east of the Public Square, but he subsequently removed to\r\na point east of the present city limits, somewhere on a line with Kinsman\r\nStreet. Here he remained until his death.\r\n\r\nThe next families who were attracted to this settlement were those of\r\nMajor Lorenzo Carter and Ezekiel Hawley, who came from Kirtland, Vermont,\r\nthe family of the Major being accompanied by Miss Cloe Inches. In the\r\nSpring of the following year, (1798,) the former gentleman sowed two acres\r\nof corn on the west side of Water street. He was also the first person who\r\nerected a frame building in the city, which he completed in 1802; but an\r\nunfortunate casualty proved fatal to the enterprise, for when he was about\r\nto occupy the residence it was totally destroyed by fire. In 1803,\r\nhowever, he erected another house on the site of the destroyed building,\r\nbut on this occasion he confined himself to hewn logs.\r\n\r\nThe fourth addition of the season was that of Nathan Chapman and his\r\nfamily, who, like the patriarchs of yore, traveled with his herd, and\r\nmarched into the Forest City at the head of two yoke of oxen and four\r\nmilch cows, which were the first neat stock that fed from the rich\r\npasturage on the banks of the Cuyahoga.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 1797, the surveying party returned to the Western Reserve\r\nand resumed their labors, with Cleveland as a head-quarters. It was a very\r\nsickly season and three of the number died, one of whom was David\r\nEldridge, whose remains were interred in a piece of ground chosen as a\r\ncemetery, at the corner of Prospect and Ontario streets. This funeral\r\noccurred on the 3d of June, 1797, and is the first recorded in the city.\r\nRecently, while making some improvements to the buildings now occupying\r\nthat location, some human bones were discovered.\r\n\r\nLess than one month after the first funeral, occurred the first wedding.\r\nOn the 1st of July, 1797, the marriage was solemnized of William Clement,\r\nof Erie, to Miss Cloe Inches, who had come to this city with the family of\r\nMajor Lorenzo Carter. The ceremony was performed by Mr. Seth Hart, who was\r\nregarded by the surveying party as their chaplain.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the following year, (1798,) the population had\r\nincreased to fifteen. No other immigration is recorded until that of\r\nRodolphus Edwards and Nathaniel Doane and their families, in 1799, the\r\nlatter consisting of nine persons. They journeyed from Chatham,\r\nConnecticut, and were occupied ninety-two days in their transit--a longer\r\nperiod than is now allowed to accomplish a voyage to the East Indies.\r\n\r\nIn 1799, the Land Company caused a road to be surveyed and partially\r\nworked, from Cleveland to the Pennsylvania line, about ten miles from the\r\nlake, which was the first road opened through the Reserve. In the Spring\r\nof that year Wheeler W. Williams, from Norwich, Connecticut, and Major\r\nWyatt, erected a grist mill at the falls at Newburgh, and in 1800 a saw\r\nmill was also built by them; a substantial proof that sufficient corn and\r\nwheat were grown and lumber required to warrant the speculation.\r\n\r\nThe desire of moral culture and education did not relax in this lonely\r\nregion, and in 1800, a township school was organized, and the children\r\nwere taught by Sarah Doane. The site of the school house was near\r\nKingsbury's, on the ridge road.\r\n\r\nCleveland received two additions in 1800, in the persons of David Clarke\r\nand Amos Spafford, the former of whom erected a house on Water street. The\r\nfirst sermon preached in Cleveland, was delivered in that year by the Rev.\r\nJoseph Badger, an agent of the Connecticut Missionary Society.\r\n\r\nThe years of 1798, 1799 and 1800, were remarkable for the early\r\ncommencement of genial weather. Pinks were in bloom in February, and the\r\npeach trees were also in full blossom in March.\r\n\r\nIn 1801, the first distillery was erected by David Bryant. The memorable\r\n4th of July of the same year was celebrated by the first ball in\r\nCleveland. It took place at Major Carter's log house, on the slope from\r\nSuperior street to the harbor, and was attended by thirty of both sexes.\r\n\r\nThe first village school was held in Major Carter's house in 1802, and the\r\nchildren were taught by Anna Spafford.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, Elisha Norton arrived in Cleveland with a stock of goods\r\nprincipally adapted to the Indian trade, which he exhibited for sale in\r\nMajor Carter's house. The State of Ohio was this year admitted into the\r\nUnion, and the first election was held at James Kingsbury's.\r\n\r\nThe first Post Office was established here in 1804, when letters were\r\nreceived and transmitted every seven days.\r\n\r\nIn 1805, the harbor was made a port of entry, and classed within the Erie\r\ndistrict. In the same year the territory on the west side of Cuyahoga was\r\nceded to the State by treaty. During the negotiations for that treaty, one\r\nof the commissioners, Hon. Gideon Granger, distinguished for talents,\r\nenterprise and forethought, uttered to his astonished associates this\r\nbold, and what was then deemed, extraordinary prediction: \"Within fifty\r\nyears an extensive city will occupy these grounds, and vessels will sail\r\ndirectly from this port into the Atlantic Ocean.\" The prediction has been\r\nfulfilled, though the latter portion of it required an extension of time,\r\nof a year or two to make the fulfilment literal.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, Nathan Perry and family and Judge Walworth removed to Cleveland\r\nthe latter from Painesville. In the same year the first militia training\r\noccurred. The place of rendezvous was Doane's corner, and the muster\r\namounted to about fifty men.\r\n\r\nIn 1809, the county of Cuyahoga was formed, Cleveland chosen as the county\r\nseat, and Amos Spafford was elected representative. The same year Abraham\r\nHickox commenced business as a blacksmith, under the euphonious cognomen\r\nof \"Uncle Abram.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of June, 1810, the first Court of Record was held in a frame\r\nbuilding erected by Elias and Harvey Murray, on the north side of Superior\r\nStreet, of which Judge Ruggles was President, assisted by three Associate\r\nJudges. George Wallis and family arrived this year and opened a tavern.\r\nSamuel and Matthew Williamson began business as tanners. Dr. David Long\r\ncommenced practice as a physician, and Alfred Kelley as the first attorney\r\nin Cleveland. Elias and Harvey Murray opened a store this year in Union\r\nlane, and may be termed the first general merchants.\r\n\r\nIn 1812, was the first trial for murder and the execution in Cleveland,\r\nthat of the Indian O'Mic, for the murder of two white trappers near\r\nSandusky City. In the same year the court house was built.\r\n\r\nThe first brick house erected in the city was that of J. E. and I. Kelley,\r\nin Superior Street. It was built in 1814; but the bricks were very unlike\r\nthose of the present day, being more than twice their size. They were made\r\nin Cleveland. This edifice was soon succeeded by another of the same\r\nmaterial, built by Alfred Kelley, in Water street.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, Cleveland was incorporated by the Legislature with a village\r\ncharter and Alfred Kelley was the first President.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, the first bank was established in the city, under the title\r\nof the Commercial Bank of Lake Erie, of which Leonard Case took the\r\nmanagement. In that year the number of vessels enrolled as hailing\r\nfrom the port of Cleveland, was but seven, and their aggregate\r\nburthen 430 tons.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, the first church was organized, which was the Episcopal church of\r\nTrinity; but it was not until 1828 that the edifice was erected on the\r\ncorner of St. Clair and Seneca streets.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of July, 1818, the first newspaper was printed in this city,\r\n\"The Cleveland Gazette and Commercial Register.\" On the 1st of September in\r\nthe same year, the first steam vessel entered the harbor, the\r\n\"Walk-in-the-Water,\" commanded by Captain Fish, from Buffalo, putting in\r\non its way to Detroit. It was 300 tons burthen, had accommodations for one\r\nhundred cabin and a greater number of steerage passengers, and was\r\npropelled at eight or ten miles an hour. Its arrival and departure were\r\ngreeted with several rounds of artillery, and many persons accompanied her\r\nto Detroit.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Mr. Barber built a log hut on the west side of the harbor, and\r\nmay be considered the first permanent settler in Ohio City.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, was established a stage conveyance to Columbus, and in the autumn\r\na second proceeded to Norwalk. In 1821, these efforts were followed by\r\nothers, and two additional wagons were started, one for Pittsburgh and\r\nanother for Buffalo.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, an appropriation was made by Government for the improvement of\r\nthe harbor, being the first Government aid received for that purpose. The\r\nwater in the river was frequently so shallow that it was customary for\r\nvessels to lie off in the lake and transfer passengers and freight by\r\nboats. On the 4th of July in that year ground was broken at Licking Summit\r\nfor the Ohio canal, to connect the waters of Lake Erie at Cleveland with\r\nthose of the Ohio river at Portsmouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, Mr. Walworth, the harbor-master and Government agent, proceeded\r\nto Washington, and after the most strenuous exertions, succeeded in\r\nobtaining a further grant of $10,000 for the improvement of the harbor. In\r\nthe same year the Ohio canal was opened to Akron, and the first\r\nimportation of coal to Cleveland made.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, a new court-house was erected on the Public Square.\r\n\r\nThe light-house, on the bluff at the end of Water street, was built\r\nin 1830, the lantern being one hundred and thirty-five feet above\r\nwater level.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, the Ohio canal was finished and communication between the lake\r\nand the Ohio river opened. In the same year a new jail was built on\r\nChamplain street.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, some of the streets were graded, and the village assumed such\r\nimportance that application for a city charter began to be talked of.\r\n\r\nThe population of the city had grown in 1835 to 5,080, having more than\r\ndoubled in two years. There was at this time an immense rush of people to\r\nthe West. Steamers ran from Buffalo to Detroit crowded with passengers at\r\na fare of eight dollars, the number on board what would now be called\r\nsmall boats, sometimes reaching from five hundred to six hundred persons.\r\nThe line hired steamers and fined them a hundred dollars if the round trip\r\nwas not made in eight days. The slower boats, not being able to make that\r\ntime with any certainty, frequently stopped at Cleveland, discharged their\r\npassengers, and put back to Buffalo. It sometimes chanced that the shore\r\naccommodations were insufficient for the great crowd of emigrants stopping\r\nover at this port, and the steamers were hired to lie off the port all\r\nnight, that the passengers might have sleeping accommodations. In that\r\nyear fire destroyed a large part of the business portion of Cleveland. At\r\nthe same period James S. Clark built, at his own expense, the old Columbus\r\nstreet bridge, connecting Cleveland with Brooklyn township, and donated it\r\nto the city. Two years later this bridge was the occasion and scene of the\r\nfamous \"battle of the bridge,\" to be noticed in its proper place.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Cleveland was granted a charter as a city. Greatly to the\r\nmortification of many of the citizens, the people across the river had\r\nreceived their charter for the organization of Ohio City before that for\r\nthe city of Cleveland came to hand, and Ohio City, therefore, took\r\nprecedence on point of age. This tended to embitter the jealous rivalry\r\nbetween the two cities, and it was only after long years that this feeling\r\nbetween the dwellers on the two sides of the river died out.\r\n\r\nThe settlement on the west side of the river had been made originally by\r\nJosiah Barber and Richard Lord. Soon after Alonzo Carter purchased on\r\nthat side of the river and kept tavern in the \"Red House,\" opposite\r\nSuperior street. In 1831, the Buffalo Company purchased the Carter farm\r\nwhich covered the low land towards the mouth of the river, and the\r\noverlooking bluffs. They covered the low ground with warehouses, and the\r\nbluffs with stores and residences. Hotels were erected and preparations\r\nmade for the building up of a city that should far eclipse the older\r\nsettlement on the east side of the river. The company excavated a short\r\nship canal from the Cuyahoga to the old river bed, at the east end, and\r\nthe waters being high, a steamboat passed into the lake, through a\r\nnatural channel at the west end.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed to get a city charter for Cleveland, negotiations\r\nwere entered into between the leading men on both sides of the river with\r\nthe purpose of either consolidating the two villages into one city, or at\r\nleast acting in harmony. The parties could agree neither on terms of\r\nconsolidation nor on boundaries. The negotiations were broken off, and\r\neach side started its deputation to Columbus to procure a city charter,\r\nwith the result we have already noticed.\r\n\r\nOhio City was ambitions to have a harbor of its own, entirely independent\r\nof Cleveland and to the advantages of which that city could lay no claim.\r\nThe old river bed was to be deepened and the channel to the lake at the\r\nwest end re-opened. As a preliminary to this ignoring of the Cleveland\r\nharbor entrance of the Cuyahoga, a canal was cut through the marsh, from\r\nopposite the entrance to the Ohio canal to the old river bed, which was\r\nthus to be made the terminus of the Ohio canal.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, city rivalry ran so high that it resulted in the \"battle of the\r\nbridge.\" Both sides claimed jurisdiction over the Columbus street bridge\r\nbuilt by Mr. Clark and donated for public use. Armed men turned out on\r\neither side to take possession of the disputed structure. A field piece\r\nwas posted on the low ground on the Cleveland side, to rake the bridge.\r\nGuns, pistols, crowbars, clubs and stones were freely used on both sides.\r\nMen were wounded of both parties, three of them seriously. The draw was\r\ncut away, the middle pier and the western abutment partially blown down,\r\nand the field piece spiked by the west siders. But the sheriff and the\r\ncity marshal of Cleveland appeared on the scene, gained possession of the\r\ndilapidated bridge, which had been given to the city of Cleveland, and\r\nlodged some of the rioters in thee county jail. This removed the bridge\r\nquestion from the camp and battle-field to the more peaceful locality of\r\nthe courts.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, the population had increased to 6071, so that, notwithstanding\r\nthat the city had been suffering from depression, there was an influx of a\r\nthousand persons in the last five years.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, the Pennsylvania and Ohio Canal was completed, Connecting the\r\nOhio Canal at Akron with the Ohio river at Beaver, Pennsylvania, and thus\r\nforming a water communication with Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThe United States Marine Hospital, pleasantly situated on the banks of the\r\nlake, was commenced in 1844 and not completed until 1852. It is surrounded\r\nby eight acres of ground, and is designed to accommodate one hundred and\r\nforty patients.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the city voted to loan its credit for $200,000 towards the\r\nconstruction of a railroad from Cleveland to Columbus and Cincinnati, and\r\nsubsequently the credit of the city was pledged for the loan of $100,000\r\ntowards the completion of the Cleveland and Erie or Lake Shore line.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, the 23d of February, the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati\r\nRailroad was opened for travel; and on the same day forty miles of the\r\nCleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad was likewise completed. These\r\ncircumstances produced great rejoicings, for during the period of their\r\nconstruction the city had been almost daily adding to the number of its\r\ninhabitants, so that it had nearly doubled in the last six years, its\r\npopulation being now 21,140, and in the following year (1852) it added\r\neighty-seven persons per week to its numbers, being then 25,670.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, the new court house was built and the old court house on the\r\nPublic Square was taken down.\r\n\r\nWe have thus glanced at a few of the leading incidents in the history of\r\nthe city. A more full and exact account will be found in the historical\r\nsketches prefacing each department in the body of the work, and still\r\nfurther details will be found in the biographical sketches. There only\r\nremains to be added here a few data in regard to the population,\r\ngovernment, and officials of the city.\r\n\r\nThe population of Cleveland commenced in 1796, with four persons. Next\r\nyear the number increased to fifteen, but in 1800, had fallen back to\r\nseven. The subsequent figures are: 1810, 57; 1820, about 150; 1825, about\r\n500; 1830, United States census, 1,075; 1832, about 1,500; 1833, about\r\n1,900; 1834, city census, 6,071, or with Ohio City, 7,648; 1845, 9,573, or\r\nwith Ohio City, 12,035; 1846, Cleveland 10,135; 1850, United States\r\ncensus, 17,034, or with Ohio City, 20,984; 1851, city census, 21,140;\r\n1852, 25,670; 1860, United States census for combined city, 43,838; 1866,\r\n67,500; 1869, not less than 100,000.\r\n\r\nThe village of Cleveland was incorporated in 1814, and the first president\r\nof the village, elected in 1815, was Alfred Kelley. Twelve votes were cast\r\nat the election. In the following year he resigned his position, and his\r\nfather, Daniel Kelley, was elected by the same number of votes, retaining\r\nhis position until 1820, when Horace Perry was made president. In the\r\nfollowing year he was succeeded by Reuben Wood. From the year 1821 to\r\n1825, Leonard Case was regularly elected president of the corporation, but\r\nneglecting to qualify in the latter year, the recorder, E. Waterman,\r\nbecame president, ex-officio. Here the records are defective until the\r\nyear 1828, when it appears Mr. Waterman received the double office of\r\npresident and recorder. On account of ill-health he resigned, and on the\r\n30th of May the trustees appointed Oirson Cathan as president. At the\r\nannual election in June, 1829, Dr. David Long was elected president, and\r\nduring his presidency a fire-engine was purchased. Forty-eight votes were\r\ncast at this election. For the years 1830 and 1831, Richard Hilliard was\r\npresident, and for the following year John W. Allen was chosen, and\r\nretained the position until 1835, one hundred and six votes being cast at\r\nthe last named election.\r\n\r\nThe mayors of Ohio City, up to the time of the consolidation, were as\r\nfollows; 1836, Josiah Barber; 1837, Francis A. Burrows; 1838-9, Norman C.\r\nBaldwin; 1840-41, Needham M. Standart; 1842, Francis A. Burrows; 1843,\r\nRichard Lord; 1844-5-6, D. H. Lamb; 1847, David Griffith; 1848, John\r\nBeverlin; 1849, Thomas Burnham; 1850-51-52, Benjamin Sheldon; 1853, Wm.\r\nB. Castle.\r\n\r\nThe first mayor of the city of Cleveland was John W. Willey, who held the\r\noffice for two terms, namely, for the years 1836 and 1837, the term under\r\nthe old constitution being but for one year. In 1858, the term was\r\nextended to two years, Abner C. Brownell being re-elected for the first\r\ntwo-year term. Under that mayoralty the consolidation of the two cities\r\nwas effected, and the next mayor, according to the understanding, was\r\ntaken from the late municipality of Ohio City, William B. Castle being\r\nelected for the term of 1855-6.\r\n\r\nWhen Cleveland was raised to the dignity of a city, in 1836, it was\r\ndivided into three wards, each ward represented by three councilmen and\r\none alderman. In 1851, a fourth ward was added, the increased population\r\nrendering the re-arrangement necessary. In 1853, under the operation of\r\nthe new constitution, the aldermen were dispensed with; the wards had\r\npreviously been restricted to two trustees, or councilmen, each. In 1854,\r\nthe two cities of Cleveland and Ohio City having been united, the\r\nconsolidated city was divided into eleven wards. This number remained\r\nuntil 1868, when, by the annexation of additional territory, a re-division\r\nwas necessitated, and the city districted into fifteen wards.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting and valuable contribution to the municipal history of\r\nthe city we give the following complete record of the executive and\r\nlegislative government of Cleveland since its organization as a city:\r\n\r\n1836.

When the white population numbered\r\nfrom a few dozen to a few hundred, it is difficult to define what was\r\ncommerce and what mere barter for individual accommodation. Every man did\r\na little trading on his own account. The carpenter, the tailor, the judge\r\nand the preacher were alike ready to vary their customary occupations by a\r\ndicker whenever an opportunity offered. The craftsman purchased what\r\nnecessities or comforts he needed, and paid in the work of his hands. The\r\npossessor of one article of daily use traded his superfluity for another\r\narticle, and for all articles furs and skins were legal tender, as they\r\ncould be sent east and converted into money or merchandise.\r\n\r\nThe first strictly commercial transactions were with the Indians. They\r\nneeded powder and lead for hunting, blankets for their comfort, beads for\r\nthe adornment of the squaws, and the two great luxuries--or\r\nnecessities--of frontier life, salt and whisky. In payment for these they\r\nbrought game, to supply the settlers with fresh provisions, and skins, the\r\ncurrency of the West. In course of time the opening up of the country\r\nbeyond made a new market for the salt, whisky, and salt provisions\r\ncollected at Cleveland, and with these staples went occasionally a few\r\narticles of eastern made goods for the use of the frontiermen's wives. As\r\nthe country became more settled the commercial importance of Cleveland\r\nincreased, until it divided with Detroit and Buffalo the honors and\r\nprofits of the commerce of the lakes.\r\n\r\nCleveland was settled in 1796. PFiveyears later the first commercial\r\nmovement was made by the erection of a distillery for the purpose of\r\nproviding an adequate supply of the basis of early western\r\ncommerce--whisky. The trade operations were of a promiscuous and desultory\r\ncharacter until about the year 1810, when a log warehouse was built by\r\nMajor Carter, on the bank of the lake, between Meadow and Spring streets,\r\nand this was speedily followed by another, built by Elias and Harvey\r\nMurray, which became the centre of business and gossip for the village\r\nand the country round about. Of course a full supply of the great\r\nstaple--whisky--was kept.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 Cleveland became a lively and prosperous place, it having been\r\nchosen as a depot of supplies and rendezvous for troops engaged in the\r\nwar. A good business was done in selling to the army, in exchanging with\r\nthe quartermasters, and in transporting troops and supplies. This was a\r\nflourishing time for Cleveland, and its inhabitants in many cases made\r\nsmall fortunes, realizing several hundred dollars in hard cash.\r\n\r\nThe close of the war brought the usual reaction, and the commerce of the\r\nembryo city lagged, but gradually improved under the stimulus of\r\nincreasing emigration to the West. In 1816 it had reached such a point\r\nthat a bank was deemed necessary to the proper transaction of trade, and\r\nthe Commercial Bank of Lake Erie was opened, with Leonard Case as\r\npresident. It had the misfortune of being born too soon, and its life\r\nconsequently was not long. At the same time, the projectors of the bank\r\nwere not wholly without warrant for their anticipations of success, for\r\nCleveland was doing a good business and owned an extensive lake marine of\r\nseven craft, measuring in the aggregate four hundred and thirty tons.\r\n\r\nThe harbor facilities of Cleveland at this time were very few. The river\r\nmouth, to the westward of the present entrance, was frequently choked with\r\nsand, and sometimes to such an extent that persons could cross dry shod.\r\nVessels of any considerable size--and a size then called \"considerable\"\r\nwould now be held in very slight estimation--made no attempt to enter the\r\nriver, but came to anchor outside, and were unloaded by lighters. In 1807\r\na scheme was set on foot for opening a line of communication for trading\r\npurposes between Lake Erie and the Ohio river, by cleaning out the\r\nchannels of the Cuyahoga and Tuscarawas riverspretentiousssage of boats\r\nand batteaux; a wagon road, seven miles long, from Old Portage to New\r\nPortage, making the connection between the two rivers. It was supposed\r\nthat twelve thousand dollars would suffice for the purpose, and the\r\nLegislature authorized a lottery by which the funds were to be raised.\r\nThere were to be twelve thousand eight hundred tickets at five dollars\r\neach, with prizes aggregating sixty-four thousand dollars, from which a\r\ndeduction of twelve and a half per cent, was to be made. The drawing never\r\ncame off, and the money paid for the tickets was refunded some years\r\nafterwards, without interest. In 1816 an attempt was made to improve the\r\nentrance to the harbor by means of a pier into the lake. A company was\r\norganized for the purpose, a charter obtained from the Legislature, and\r\nsomething done towards building the pier, but the storms soon washed the\r\nslight construction away.\r\n\r\nTen years later, the work of improving the harbor under the direction of\r\nthe National Government was begun, the first appropriation being of five\r\nthousand dollars. A new channel was cut, piers commenced, and the work\r\nentered upon which has been carried on with varying energy to the present\r\ntime. The opening of the river gave considerable impetus to the commerce\r\nof the place, which was then carried on wholly by lake.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Ohio canal was the first grand starting point in the\r\ncommercial history of Cleveland. It brought into connection with the lake\r\nhighway to market a rich country rapidly filling up with industrious\r\nsettlers, and the products of dairies, grain farms, and grazing lands were\r\nbrought in great quantity to Cleveland, where they were exchanged for New\r\nYork State salt, lake fish, and eastern merchandise. Two years after the\r\nopening of the canal, which was completed in 1832, the receipts amounted\r\nto over half a million bushels of wheat, a hundred thousand barrels of\r\nflour, a million pounds of butter and nearly seventy thousand pounds of\r\ncheese, with other articles in proportion. Business went on increasing\r\nwith great rapidity; every one was getting rich, in pocket or on paper,\r\nand Cleveland was racing with its then rival, but now a part of itself,\r\nOhio City, for the distinction of being the great commercial centre of the\r\nWest. At that moment, in the year 1837, the great crash came and business\r\nof all kinds was paralyzed.\r\n\r\nCleveland was one of the first places in the West to recover. Its basis\r\nwas good, and as the interior of Ohio became more peopled the trade of the\r\ncanal increased and, of course, Cleveland was so much the more benefited.\r\nThe opening of the Pennsylvania and Ohio canal, in 1841, opened\r\ncommunication with Pittsburgh and added a trade in iron, nails, and glass\r\nto the other branches of business. In 1844 the commerce of Cleveland by\r\nlake had reached an aggregate of twenty millions for the year.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the railroad to Columbus in 1851 marked the second step in\r\nthe business history of the city. The canals brought business from the\r\nsouth-east, and by a slow and uncertain route from Cincinnati. The\r\ncompletion of the railroad gave direct and speedy connection with\r\nCincinnati, with the rich valleys of the Miami, and with lands hitherto\r\nundeveloped or seeking other markets for their produce. Other railroads\r\nwere rapidly built, and developed new avenues of commerce and new sources\r\nof wealth. The population increased rapidly. The streets were extended and\r\nlined with new buildings. Additional stores were opened and all\r\ndepartments felt the rush of new life. The lake commerce of the port, in\r\nspite of the business drawn off by competing railroads, increased in 1853\r\nto a total of eighty-seven million dollars, more than four times the\r\namount reached nine years before, after the canal System had been\r\ncompleted and was in full operation. The grain trade which once was the\r\nfoundation of the commerce of the city, had fallen away owing the gradual\r\nremoval of the wheat producing territory westward. It was asserted, and\r\ngenerally believed, that the canals had done all they could for the\r\nprosperity of the city, and that unless something new turned up for its\r\nbenefit, Cleveland would remain at a stand-still, or increase only by very\r\nslow degrees. Business was extremely dull, the prospect looked dubious,\r\nmany business men moved to other cities and more were preparing to follow.\r\nJust then two things occurred. The war broke out, and the Atlantic and\r\nGreat Western railway was extended to Cleveland. The latter event opened a\r\nnew market for trade in north-western Pennsylvania, and soon after, by\r\nsending a large proportion of the product of the oil regions to this point\r\nfor refining or shipment, built up an immense and lucrative department of\r\nmanufacture and commerce, whose effect was felt in all classes of\r\nbusiness. The war stimulated manufactures, and by a sudden bound Cleveland\r\nset out on the path of permanent prosperity long pointed out by some\r\nfar-seeing men, but until the time referred to strangely neglected. In a\r\nvery few years the population more than doubled the existing facilities\r\nfor business were found totally inadequate for the suddenly increased\r\ndemands, and the most strenuous exertions of the builders failed to meet\r\nthe call for new stores. Manufactory after manufactory came into\r\nexistence, and with each there was an influx of population and a\r\nconsequent increase in all departments of trade. And the work still goes\r\non, every manufactory started creating some need hitherto unfelt, and thus\r\nrendering other manufactories necessary to supply the need.\r\n\r\nA careful census of population and business, made towards the close of\r\n1868, in compliance with a request from one department of the Government\r\nat Washington, showed that the population had increased to ninety\r\nthousand; the value of real estate was valued at fifty millions of\r\ndollars, and of personal property at thirty millions. The commerce,\r\nincluding receipts and shipments by lake, canal, and railroad, was taken\r\nat eight hundred and sixty-five millions of dollars; the value of\r\nmanufactures for the year at nearly fifty millions; the lake arrivals and\r\nclearances at ten thousand, with an aggregate tonnage of over three\r\nmillions of tons; and the number of vessels and canal boats owned here at\r\nnearly four hundred. Seventy years ago Major Carter resided here in lonely\r\nstate with his family, being the only white family in the limits of what\r\nis now the city of Cleveland. The cash value of the entire trade of\r\nCleveland at that time would not pay a very cheap clerk's salary\r\nnow-a-days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevi Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biography of Levi Johnson is, in effect, the history of Cleveland, and\r\na sketch of the more active period of his life involves the narrative of\r\nlife in Cleveland during the earlier years of its existence. It is,\r\ntherefore, of more than ordinary interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson is a native of Herkimer county, New York, having been born in\r\nthat county April 25th, 1786. He commenced life in a time and place that\r\nadmitted of no idlers, young or old, and in his tenth year it was his\r\nweekly task to make and dip out a barrel of potash, he being too young to\r\nbe employed with the others in wood-chopping. Until his fourteenth year he\r\nlived with an uncle, working on a farm, and laboring hard. At that age he\r\ndetermined to be a carpenter and joiner, and entered the shop of Ephraim\r\nDerrick, with whom he remained four years. At eighteen, he changed masters\r\nand worked with Laflet Remington, and at twenty-one changed again to\r\nStephen Remington, with whom he worked at barn building one year.\r\n\r\nIt was whilst he was with Stephen Remington that an event occurred that\r\nshaped Levi Johnson's future life. Considerable interest had been excited\r\nin regard to Ohio, towards which emigrants were frequently seen taking\r\ntheir way. A brother of Stephen Remington was sent west to spy out the\r\nland and report on its desirableness as a home. This committee of one, on\r\nlands, came to Newburgh, and was so strongly impressed with the advantages\r\nof the place from which Cleveland was afterwards said to be but six miles\r\ndistant, that he allowed his imagination to run away with his veracity. He\r\nwrote back that he had struck the richest country in the world; that the\r\nsoil was marvelously fertile, and that corn grew so tall and strong that\r\nthe raccoons ran up the stems and lodged on the ears out of the way of the\r\ndogs. Great was the excitement in Herkimer county when this report was\r\nreceived. Such wonderful growth of corn was never known in York State, but\r\nOhio was a _terra incognita_, and Munchausen himself would have had a\r\nchance of being believed had he located his adventures in what was then\r\nthe Far West. Stephen Remington quit barn-building, shut up his shop,\r\npacked up his tools and started in the Fall of 1807 for the new Eden, on\r\nLake Erie. In the succeeding Spring, Johnson followed in his footsteps as\r\nfar as East Bloomfield, near Canandaigua, where he worked during that\r\nSummer, building a meeting-house.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1808, he shouldered his pack and set out on foot for the\r\nWest. At Buffalo he found work and wintered there until February, when his\r\nuncle came along, bound also for the land of promise. There was room in\r\nthe sleigh for Levi, and he was not loth to avail himself of the\r\nopportunity of making his journey quicker and easier than on foot. On the\r\n10th of March, 1809, the sleigh and its load entered Cleveland.\r\n\r\nBy that time it had come to be hard sledding, so the sleigh was abandoned\r\nand the two travelers, determining to put farther west, mounted the horses\r\nand continued their journey to Huron county. Here they fell in with Judge\r\nWright and Ruggles, who were surveying the Fire Lands. They wanted a\r\nsaw-mill, and Johnson's uncle contracted to build one at the town of\r\nJessup, now known as Wakeman. Levi turned back to Cleveland, and was\r\nfortunate in finding a home in the family of Judge Walworth. The Judge\r\nwanted an office built, and Johnson undertook to make it. Hitherto, all\r\nthe houses were of logs; but the Judge, having a carpenter boarding in his\r\nfamily, aspired to something more pretentions. The building was to be\r\nframe. At that time Euclid was a flourishing settlement, and rejoiced in\r\nthat important feature--a saw-mill. The lumber was brought from Euclid,\r\nthe frame set up on Superior street, about where the American House now\r\nstands, and every day the gossips of the little settlement gathered to\r\nwatch and discuss the progress of the first frame building in Cleveland.\r\nThe work occupied forty days, and when it was completed, there was great\r\npride in this new feature of Cleveland architecture. The erection of the\r\nfirst frame building marked the commencement of a new era.\r\n\r\nThat job done, Levi turned back to Huron to fulfill the contract made by\r\nhis uncle for the erection of a saw-mill. This was a heavy job for so\r\nsmall a force, and between three and four months were spent in it.\r\nSlinging his kit of tools on his back, he then turned once more towards\r\nCleveland, in which he settled down for the remainder of his life, the\r\nnext two or three years being spent in building houses and barns in\r\nCleveland, and in the more flourishing village of Newburgh. A saw-mill\r\nalso was put up on Tinker's creek.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Johnson was building the saw-mill at Jessup, he fell in with a\r\nyoung lady, Miss Montier, who enjoyed the distinction of being the first\r\nwhite girl that landed in Huron, where she lived with a family named\r\nHawley. The young carpenter fell in love with the only pretty girl to be\r\nfound in the neighborhood, and she was not unkindly disposed to the young\r\nman. When he returned to Cleveland she was induced to come also, and lived\r\nwith Judge Walworth, at that time the great landed owner, and consequently\r\nprominent man in the thriving village of sixty inhabitants. In 1811, the\r\ncouple were married.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1812, Johnson made a contract with the County\r\nCommissioners, Messrs. Wright, Ruggles and Miles, to build a Court House\r\nand Jail on the Public Square, opposite where the First Presbyterian\r\nChurch now stands. The material was to be logs, laid end-wise for greater\r\nsecurity. The work was pushed forward rapidly the next Summer, and towards\r\nnoon of September 12th, Johnson and his men were just putting the\r\nfinishing touches to the building, when they were startled by what seemed\r\nthe roar of distant thunder. On looking out of the windows not a cloud\r\ncould be seen in the sky, but the reverberations continued, and at once\r\nthe conviction that the noise was of cannons seized them. Throwing down\r\ntheir tools they ran to the bank of the lake, where nearly all the\r\nvillagers at home to the number of about thirty, were already gathered,\r\nstretching their eyes to the westward, whence the sounds came. Now the\r\nreports of the cannon could be plainly distinguished. They knew that\r\nPerry's fleet had passed up the lake, and that, consequently, a battle\r\ncould be at any moment expected. The louder reports told when the\r\nAmericans fired, for their guns were of heavier caliber than the English.\r\nAt last the firing ceased for a while. Then three loud reports, evidently\r\nAmerican, were heard, and the little crowd, convinced that their side had\r\nwon, gave three hearty cheers for Perry.\r\n\r\nAbout two days afterwards, Johnson and a man named Rumidge picked up a\r\nlarge flat-boat that had been built by General Jessup for the conveyance\r\nof troops, and then abandoned. Each of the finders purchased a hundred\r\nbushels of potatoes, took them to the army at Put-in-Bay, quadrupling the\r\nmoney invested, and giving Johnson his first financial start in life.\r\n\r\nAs General Jessup needed the boat to transfer his troops to Malden, he\r\nretained it, taking Rumidge also into service, and leaving Johnson to\r\nreturn to Cleveland on the gunboat Somers, of which he was made pilot for\r\nthe voyage. Shortly afterwards Rumidge returned with the boat and brought\r\nnews that the American forces had fought a battle with the British at\r\nMoravian Town. Johnson resumed command of the flat-boat, and with his\r\nassociate freighted it with supplies for the army at Detroit. The\r\nspeculation was successful, and Johnson engaged with the quartermaster of\r\nthe post to bring a cargo of clothing from Cleveland to Detroit. The\r\nseason was far advanced, and the voyage was cut short by the ice in the\r\nupper part of the lake, so that the boat was headed for Huron, where the\r\ncargo was landed and the freight for that distance paid.\r\n\r\nJohnson was now a man of means, the successful transactions with the army\r\nhaving given him more money than he had ever possessed at one time before.\r\nHis voyages and trading success had given him a taste for similar\r\noccupations in the future, and his first step was to build a vessel for\r\nhimself. His first essay in ship-building was something novel. The keel\r\nwas laid for a ship of thirty-five tons, to be named the Pilot. There was\r\nno iron for spikes, but wooden pins supplied their place. Other devices of\r\nsimilar primitiveness were resorted to in the course of the work, and at\r\nlast she was finished. Now came the question of launching, and it was not\r\nlightly to be answered. Modern builders sometimes meet with a difficulty\r\nowing to the ship sticking on the \"ways,\" but this early ship-builder of\r\nCleveland had a greater obstacle than this to overcome. He had built his\r\nship with very slight reference to the lake on which she was to float. For\r\nconvenience in getting timber, and other reasons, he had made his\r\nship-yard about half a mile from the water, near where St. Paul's Church\r\nnow stands on Euclid avenue, and the greasing of the \"ways\" and knocking\r\nout of the blocks would not ensure a successful launch. Here was a\r\ndilemma. Johnson pondered and then resolved. An appeal for aid was\r\npromptly responded to. The farmers from Euclid and Newburgh came in with\r\ntwenty-eight yoke of cattle. The ship was hoisted on wheels and drawn in\r\ntriumph down the main street to the foot of Superior street hill, where\r\nshe was launched into the river amid the cheers of the assembled crowd.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first of Cleveland ship-building. About the year 1808,\r\nMajor Carter built the Zephyr, used in bringing goods, salt, &c., from\r\nBuffalo. After good service she was laid up in a creek, a little below\r\nBlack Rock, where she was found by the British during the war and burned.\r\nIn 1810, the firm of Bixby & Murray built the Ohio, an important craft of\r\nsomewhere about sixty tons burden, the ship-yard being lower down the\r\nriver than the point from which Johnson's craft was subsequently\r\nlaunched. Towards the close of the war she was laid up at Buffalo, when\r\nthe Government purchased her, cut her down, and converted her into a\r\npilot boat.\r\n\r\nWhilst Johnson was building his vessel another was under construction on\r\nthe flats near the present location of the works of J. G. Hussey & Co. This\r\ncraft, the Lady of the Lake, about thirty tons, was built by Mr. Gaylord,\r\nbrother of the late Mrs. Leonard Case, and was sailed by Captain Stowe,\r\nbetween Detroit and Buffalo.\r\n\r\nJohnson was now literally embarked on a sea of success. His little ship\r\nwas in immediate requisition for army purposes. Cargoes of army stores\r\nwere transported between Buffalo and Detroit. Two loads of soldiers were\r\ntaken from Buffalo to the command of Major Camp, at Detroit, and on one of\r\nthe return voyages the guns left by Harrison at Maumee were taken to Erie.\r\nThe absconding of a quarter-master with the funds in his possession, among\r\nother sums three hundred dollars belonging to Johnson, was a serious\r\ndrawback in the Summer's operations.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1815, he recommenced carrying stores to Malden, reaching\r\nthere on his first trip March 20th, and on this voyage Irad Kelley was a\r\npassenger. His second trip was made to Detroit. When passing Malden he was\r\nhailed from the fort, but as he paid no attention, Major Putoff fired a\r\nshot to make the vessel heave-to and leave the mail. The shot passed\r\nthrough the foresail, but was not heeded. A second shot was fired and then\r\nJohnson considered it prudent to heave-to and go ashore. He was sternly\r\nquestioned as to his inattention to the first orders to heave to, and\r\nreplied that being a young sailor he did not understand how to heave-to.\r\nThe officer told him to bring the mail ashore, but was met with a refusal,\r\nit being contrary to instructions. Johnson started back to his craft and\r\nwas followed by a party of men from the fort, who manned a boat and gave\r\nchase. Johnson, on boarding his vessel, spread sail, and being favored\r\nwith a good breeze, drew away from his pursuers and reached Detroit, where\r\nhe placed the mail in the post-office.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the war, whilst Johnson was building his vessel\r\nand in other ways kept busy, he was chosen coroner of Cuyahoga, being the\r\nfirst to hold that office in the county. The sparseness of the population\r\nrendered his duties light, the only inquest during his term of office\r\nbeing over the body of an old man frozen to death in Euclid.\r\n\r\nSamuel Baldwin was the first sheriff of the county, and Johnson was his\r\nfirst deputy. His first experience in office was noticeable. Major\r\nJessup, in command of the troops, had brought to Cleveland from\r\nPittsburgh a Mr. Robins, who built from thirty to forty flat bottomed\r\nboats, or batteaux, to be used in the transportation of the troops. The\r\nMajor ran short of funds and left a balance unpaid in the cost of\r\nconstruction. Robins brought suit, and the Major, thinking the deputy\r\nsheriff probably had some unpleasant business for him, studiously avoided\r\nan interview with Johnson, and whenever they met by chance, pulled out\r\nhis pistols and warned Johnson to keep his distance. It so happened,\r\nhowever, that no legal documents had been put in his hands for execution,\r\nso that the Major was alarmed without cause.\r\n\r\nBut the groundless scare of the impecunious Major was a trifling affair\r\ncompared with the grand scare that overtook the whole people along the\r\nlake in the autumn of 1812, at the time of Hull's surrender One day a\r\nfleet of vessels was seen bearing down upon the coast. It was first\r\nnoticed in the vicinity of Huron by a woman. No sooner had she seen the\r\nvessels bearing down towards the coast from the westward, than she rushed\r\ninto the house, emptied her feather bed and placed the tick on a horse as\r\na pack-saddle; then catching up one child before her and another behind,\r\nshe rode at the top of the animal's speed, thinking torture and death lay\r\nbehind her. Whenever she passed a house she raised an alarm, and at two\r\no'clock in the morning, more dead than alive with terror and fatigue, she\r\nurged her jaded horse into the village of Cleveland, screaming at the top\r\nof her voice, \"The British and Indians are coming! The British and Indians\r\nare coming!\" Men slept lightly at that time, with their senses attent to\r\nevery sound of danger. The shrieks of the woman and the dreaded notice of\r\nthe approach of the merciless foe awoke the whole village and curdled the\r\nblood of the villagers with horror. In that brief announcement, \"The\r\nBritish and Indians are coming,\" were concentrated possibilities of\r\nfrightful outrage, carnage and devastation. Wild with the terror of her\r\nlong and agonized night ride, the woman reiterated her piercing warning\r\nagain and again, filling the air with her shouts. A chorus of voices, from\r\nthe childish treble to the deep bass of the men, swelled the volume of\r\nsound and added to the confusion and alarm. In a few minutes every house\r\nwas empty, and the entire population of the village swarmed around the\r\nexhausted woman and heard her brief story, broken by gasps for breath and\r\nby hysterical sobs. She insisted that a fleet was bearing down upon the\r\ncoast with the purpose of spreading carnage and devastation along the\r\nwhole lake frontier, that the vessels were crowded with British troops and\r\nmerciless savages, and that before long the musket bail, the torch and the\r\nscalping knife would seek their victims among the inhabitants of\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nAt once all was hurry; the entire population prepared for speedy flight.\r\nThe greater part took to the woods in the direction of Euclid, the women\r\nand children being guarded by some of the men, the others remaining to\r\nreconnoiter, and, if possible, defend their property. As soon as the\r\nnon-fighting portion of the settlement was cared for, a picked force of\r\ntwenty-five men, contributed by Cleveland, Euclid and Newburgh, marched to\r\nthe mouth of the river and kept guard. It was evening when this little\r\narmy reached the river, and for hours after dark they patrolled the banks,\r\nlistening intently for the approach of the enemy. About two o'clock in the\r\nmorning a vessel was heard entering the river; the guards hastily gathered\r\nfor the attack, but before firing, hailed the supposed foe; an answering\r\nhail was returned. \"Who are you, and what have you on board?\" shouted the\r\nriver guards. \"An American vessel loaded with Hull's troops!\" was the\r\nreply. The astounded guard burst into laughter at their absurd scare. The\r\nalarm spread with greater swiftness than the report of the facts, and for\r\ndays armed men came pouring into Cleveland from so far as Pittsburgh,\r\nprepared to beat back the enemy that existed only in their imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was during this year that the Indian, Omic, was hung for participating\r\nin the murder of the trappers, Gibbs and Wood, near Sandusky, in return\r\nfor the shelter given by the trappers to their two murderers. After\r\ncommitting the murder, the Indians set fire to the hut, and the flames\r\nbecame the instrument of their capture, for some boys returning from Cold\r\nCreek Mill saw the fire, went to it, and discovered the partly consumed\r\nbodies of the murdered men. The murderers were demanded from the Indians,\r\nand Omic was captured by them and surrendered.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was lodged in Major Carter's house until the trial which was\r\nheld under a cherry tree at the corner of Water and Superior streets.\r\nAlfred Kelly prosecuted for the State, and Johnson was one of the jury.\r\nOmic was convicted and sentenced to be hung. Johnson, who sat on the jury\r\nthat condemned him, was now employed to build the gallows to hang the\r\ncriminal. When Omic was led out by Sheriff Baldwin to execution, he\r\nremarked that the gallows was too high. He then called for whisky and\r\ndrank half a pint, which loosened his tongue, and he talked rapidly and\r\nincoherently, threatening to return in two days and wreak his revenge on\r\nall the pale-faces. More liquor was given him, and he asked for more, but\r\nJudge Walworth denounced the giving him more, that he might die drunk, as\r\nan outrage, and his supply of liquor was therefore stopped.\r\n\r\nTime being up, Sheriff Baldwin was about to cut the drop-rope, when he\r\nsaw that the condemned man had clutched the rope over his head to save\r\nhis neck from being broken. The Sheriff dismounted from his horse,\r\nclimbed up the gallows and tied the prisoner's hands more firmly behind\r\nhis back. The gallows was braced, and Omic contrived to clutch one of\r\nthe braces with his hands, fastened behind his back as they were, as he\r\nfell when the drop-rope was cut. He hung in that position for some time,\r\nuntil his strength gave way and he swung off. When he had hung\r\nsufficiently long, the by-standers drew him to the cross-beam of the\r\ngallows, when the rope broke and the body of the wretched murderer fell\r\ninto his open grave beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Mr. Johnson was path-master of Cleveland, and he retains\r\nin his possession the list of names of those who did work on the roads in\r\nthat year, armed with good and sufficient shovels according to law.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson's success as a ship-builder encouraged him to persevere in\r\nthat business. In the autumn of 1815, he laid down the lines of the\r\nschooner Neptune, sixty-five tons burden, not far below the neighborhood\r\nof the Central market. In the following Spring she was launched, and run\r\non Lake Erie, her first trip being to Buffalo, whence she returned with a\r\ncargo of merchandise for Jonathan Williamson, of Detroit. In the Fall of\r\nthat year a half interest in the Neptune was sold to Richard H. Blinn,\r\nSeth Doan, and Dr. Long. In 1817, she made a trip to Mackinac, for the\r\nAmerican Fur Company, and remained in that trade until the Fall of 1819.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 1818, Major Edwards, Paymaster Smith, and another army\r\nofficer came to Mackinac on the Tiger, and engaged Mr. Johnson to take\r\nthem to Green Bay, agreeing to pay him three hundred dollars for the trip.\r\nThe same vessel, under Johnson's command, took the first load of troops\r\nfrom Green Bay to Chicago, after the massacre, Major Whistler engaging the\r\nship for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, Johnson left the Neptune, and in company with Turhooven &\r\nBrothers, built the steamer Enterprise, about two hundred and twenty\r\ntons burden. This was the first steam vessel built in Cleveland, and her\r\nhull was made near the site of the Winslow warehouse. The engine, of\r\nsixty to seventy horse power, was brought from Pittsburgh. Johnson ran\r\nher between Buffalo and Detroit until 1828, when hard times coming on\r\nand business threatening to be unprofitable, he sold his interest in\r\nher, and left the lakes. In company with Goodman and Wilkeson, he built\r\nthe Commodore, on the Chagrin river, in the year 1830, and that closed\r\nhis ship-building career.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had accumulated about thirty thousand dollars, a\r\nrespectable fortune in those days, with which he invested largely in real\r\nestate, and waited the course of events to make his investments\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, he contracted with the Government officers to build the\r\nlight-house on Water street. In 1836, he built a light-house at Sandusky.\r\nIn the following year he constructed seven hundred feet of the stone pier\r\non the east side of the Cuyahoga river mouth. The first thing done in the\r\nlatter work was the driving of spiles. Mr. Johnson became dissatisfied\r\nwith the old system of driving spiles by horse-power, and purchased a\r\nsteam engine for four hundred dollars. Making a large wooden wheel he\r\nrigged it after the style of the present spile-drivers, and in the course\r\nof two or three weeks, had the satisfaction of seeing the spiles driven\r\nwith greatly increased speed and effect by steam-power.\r\n\r\nAbout 1839, he took his new spile-driver to Maumee Bay and drove about\r\nnine hundred feet of spiling around Turtle Island, filling the enclosed\r\nspace with earth to the height of three feet, to protect the light-house.\r\nIn 1840, he built the Saginaw light-house, sixty-five feet high, with the\r\nadjoining dwelling. In 1842-3, he built the light-house on the Western\r\nSister Island, at the west end of Lake Erie. In 1847, he completed his\r\nlight-house work by building the Portage River light-house.\r\n\r\nBesides his light-house building, Mr. Johnson erected in 1842 his stone\r\nresidence on Water street, and in 1845, the Johnson House hotel on\r\nSuperior street. The stone for the former was brought from Kingston,\r\nCanada West. In 1853, he built the Johnson Block, on Bank street, and in\r\n1858, he put up the Marine Block at the mouth of the river. This completed\r\nhis active work.\r\n\r\nSince 1858, Mr. Johnson's sole occupation has been the care of his\r\nproperty and occasional speculations in real estate. By a long life of\r\nactivity and prudence, and by the steady rise in real estate, he is now\r\npossessed of personal and landed property to the value of about six\r\nhundred thousand dollars, having come to the city with no other capital\r\nthan his kit of tools, a strong arm, and an energetic purpose. Though\r\neighty-three years of age, his health is good, his memory remarkably\r\nactive, and all his faculties unimpaired. He has two sons and one daughter\r\nyet living, having lost two children. He has had nine grandchildren, and\r\nfive great-grandchildren.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNoble H. Merwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn classifying the early commercial men of Cleveland, the name of Noble H.\r\nMerwin is justly entitled to stand among the first on the list. In fact he\r\nwas the founder and father of her commerce, and a man not only noble in\r\nname, but noble in character.\r\n\r\nHe was born in New Milford, Ct., in 1782, received a good common school\r\neducation, and married Minerva Buckingham, of that town. Soon after the\r\nwar of 1812, he went to Georgia and there engaged in mercantile pursuits,\r\nhaving established a store at Savannah and also at Milledgeville. He came\r\nto Cleveland in 1815. His family rejoined him at Cleveland in February,\r\n1816. In coming from Georgia they crossed the Alleghanies, and were six\r\nweeks in accomplishing the journey, having traveled all the way in wagons.\r\nThe two elder children were born at New Milford, the other four at\r\nCleveland. The oldest son, George B. Merwin, of Rockport, is now the only\r\nsurviving member of the family.\r\n\r\nAfter the family arrived at Cleveland, Mr. Merwin engaged in keeping a\r\npublic house or tavern, as it was then designated, on the corner of\r\nSuperior street and Vineyard lane, and about the same time established a\r\nwarehouse at the foot of Superior street and commenced his career in the\r\ncommerce of the lakes. He built the schooner Minerva, which was the first\r\nvessel registered at Washington, from the District of Cuyahoga, under the\r\nU. S. Revenue Laws. For many years Mr. Merwin, under contracts with the\r\nGovernment, furnished the supplies required at the U. S. Garrisons on the\r\nwestern frontiers, at Fort Gratiot, Mackinaw, Sault St. Marie, Green Bay\r\nand Chicago, as well as the Hudson Bay Company at the Sault St. Marie.\r\n\r\nIn a commercial point of view his business became extensive for those\r\ntimes, and he enjoyed the entire confidence of the Government and of\r\nbusiness men generally throughout the lake country. He succeeded in\r\naccumulating a handsome fortune, which consisted mostly in vessel stocks\r\nand in lands. He owned a large breadth of lands, extending from the south\r\nside of Superior street to the river, which, since his time, has become\r\nexceedingly valuable.\r\n\r\nBut owing mainly to over-work in the various departments of his\r\nincreasing business, while he was yet in the noon of manhood, his\r\nhealth became seriously impaired, and with a view to recruit it he\r\nsailed for the West Indies in 1829, and on the 3d day of November, of\r\nthat year, died of consumption, at the Island of St. Thomas, in the 47th\r\nyear of his age. He was a gentleman of fine personal appearance,\r\nmeasuring six feet and four inches in height, erect and well\r\nproportioned. In a word, he was a man of heart, and of generous\r\nimpulses, honest, frank and cordial. In the circle in winch he moved, he\r\nwas the friend of everybody and everybody was his friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Blair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe race of men who remember Cleveland in the day of its small beginnings,\r\nis fast passing away. Of those who were residents of the little village on\r\nthe Cuyahoga fifty years ago, only about half a dozen now live in the\r\nflourishing city that occupies its site and inherits its name. One of\r\nthese is John Blair, well known to all the Clevelanders of ante-railroad\r\ndays, but who is probably a mere name to a large proportion of those who\r\nhave crowded into the city of late years. Mr. Blair is one of the few\r\nremaining links that connect the rude village in the forest with the\r\nmodern Forest City.\r\n\r\nJohn Blair was born in Maryland on the 18th of December, 1793. His early\r\nyears were spent in farming, but at the age of twenty-three he dropped the\r\nhoe and turned his back to the plow, resolving to come west and seek his\r\nfortune. From the time that he shook from his feet the dirt of the\r\nMaryland farm, he says, he has never done a whole day's work, at one time,\r\nat manual labor.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, he reached Cleveland, then an insignificant village of about a\r\nhundred and fifty inhabitants, who dwelt mostly in log houses, grouped at\r\nthe foot of Superior street. At the corner of Water street and what is now\r\nUnion lane, stood the pioneer hotel of Cleveland, the tavern of Major\r\nCarter, where good accommodations for man and beast were always to be\r\nfound. The young Maryland adventurer was not overburdened with wealth when\r\nhe landed in his future home, his entire cash capital being three dollars.\r\nBut it was no discredit in those days to be poor, and three dollars was a\r\nfine capital to start business upon. In fact sonic of the then \"old\r\nsettlers,\" would have been glad to possess so much capital in ready money\r\nas a reserve fund.\r\n\r\nBut even in those days of primitive simplicity, three dollars would not\r\nsupport a man for any great length of time if there were no other sources\r\nof supply. Mr. Blair recognized the fact that no time must be wasted, and\r\nat once turned his attention to a chance for speculation. An opportunity\r\nimmediately offered itself. An old Quaker, with speculation in his eye,\r\nentered Cleveland with two hundred and fifty fat hogs, expecting to find a\r\ngood market. In this he was mistaken, and as hogs on foot were expensive\r\nto hold over for a better market, he determined to convert them into salt\r\npork. Mr. Blair offered to turn pork-packer for a proper consideration;\r\nthe offer was accepted, and this was Mr. Blair's first step in business.\r\n\r\nPork-packing, as a steady business, offered but little inducement, so Mr.\r\nBlair decided on establishing himself on the river as produce dealer and\r\ncommission merchant. The capital required was small, and the work not\r\nexhaustive, for the facilities for shipping were slight and the amount to\r\nbe shipped small; warehouses were of the most modest dimensions, and\r\ndocks existed only in imagination. When the shipping merchant had a\r\nconsignment to put on board one of the diminutive vessels that at\r\nintervals found their way into the port, the stuff was put on a flat boat\r\nand poled or rowed to the vessel's side, Business was conducted in a very\r\nleisurely manner, there being no occasion for hurry, and everybody\r\nconcerned being willing to make the most of what little business there\r\nwas. The slow moving Pennsylvania Dutch who had formed settlements in\r\nnortheastern Ohio, and drove their wide wheeled wagons along the\r\nsometimes seemingly bottomless roads to Cleveland, plowed through the mud\r\non the river bank in search of \"de John Blair vat kips de white fishes,\"\r\nand after much chaffer, unloaded the flour and wheat from their wagons,\r\nand loaded up with fish and salt, sometimes giving three barrels of flour\r\nfor one barrel of salt.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, the Ohio Canal was partially opened to Cleveland, and a\r\nrevolution in trade was effected. The interior of the State was soon\r\nbrought into communication with the enterprising merchants on Lake Erie\r\nand the Ohio river. Mr. Blair was prompt to avail himself of the\r\nopportunity to increase his trade. He built the first canal boat\r\nconstructed in Cleveland, and launched her in 1828, near the site of the\r\npresent Stone Mill, amid the plaudits of all the people of the village,\r\nwho had turned out to witness the launching. As soon as the craft settled\r\nherself proudly on the bosom of the canal, Mr. Blair invited the\r\nspectators of the launch to come on board, and, with a good team of horses\r\nfor motive power, the party were treated to an excursion as far as Eight\r\nMile Lock and return, the whole day being consumed in the journey.\r\nSubsequently Mr. Blair became interested, with others, in a line of twelve\r\nboats, employing nearly one hundred horses to work them.\r\n\r\nFrom this time Cleveland continued to grow and prosper. The products of\r\nthe interior were brought in a steadily increasing stream to Cleveland by\r\nthe canal, and shipped to Detroit, then the great mart of the western\r\nlakes. A strong tide of emigration had set towards Northern Michigan, and\r\nthose seeking homes there had to be fed mainly by Ohio produce, for which\r\nMichigan fish and furs were given in exchange. But the opening of the\r\nErie Canal placed a new market within reach, and Mr. Blair was among the\r\nfirst to take Ohio flour to New York, selling it there at fourteen\r\ndollars the barrel.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, Mr. Blair, then in the prime of his vigor, being but fifty-two\r\nyears old, resolved to quit a business in which he had been uniformly\r\nsuccessful, and spend the remainder of his life in enjoying what he had\r\nacquired by diligence and enterprise. He was then the oldest merchant in\r\nthe city, having been in business over a quarter of a century. For the\r\npast twenty-four years he has taken life easy, which he has been able to\r\ndo from the sensible step he adopted of quitting active business before it\r\nwore him out. At the age of seventy-five he is still hale, hearty and\r\nvigorous, looking younger than his actual years, and possessing that great\r\ndesideratum, a sound mind in a sound body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilo Scovill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFamiliar as is the name of Philo Scovill, but few of our citizens are\r\naware that he was one of Cleveland's earliest merchants. It appears that\r\ncircumstances, not altogether the choice of Mr. Scovill, induced him to\r\ncome to Cleveland with a stock of drugs and groceries. His father was a\r\nmillwright, and had brought up his son to the use of tools. He had no\r\ntaste for his new calling, and so worked out of the store-keeping as\r\nspeedily as possible, and commenced the erection of dwellings and stores\r\nin the then new country, being only second in the trade here to Levi\r\nJohnson. He continued in the building business until 1826, when he erected\r\nthe Franklin House, on Superior street, on the next lot but one to the\r\nsite of the Johnson House. Mr. Scovill at once became the landlord, and\r\ncontinued as such for twenty-three years, excepting an interval of a five\r\nyears' lease.\r\n\r\nAbout 1849, he left the hotel business to attend to his real estate\r\ninterests. He was successful in his hotel business; and from time to time\r\ninvested his surplus capital in lands adjacent to the city, which, within\r\nthe last few years have become exceedingly valuable. Streets have been\r\nlaid out upon his property, and inducements offered to settlers that\r\ninsured a ready sale, and materially aided the growth of the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Scovill, as a man, has enjoyed the confidence of his fellow citizens\r\nto an unusual degree. He was hardworking, resolute, and exactly fitted by\r\nnature for the pioneer life of his choice, a life that, though toilsome,\r\nhas left him still hale and vigorous, with the exception of the fruits of\r\noverwork, and perhaps exposure, in the form of rheumatism.\r\n\r\nMr. Scovill was born in Salisbury, Ct., November 30, 1791. He lived at\r\nthat place until he was nine years of age, when his father moved to\r\nCornwall, in the same county; thence to Shenango county, and from thence\r\nto Seneca county, N. Y. Here he lived on the banks of Seneca Lake nine\r\nyears. After that he lived in Buffalo one year, from which point he came\r\nto Cleveland, as before stated.\r\n\r\nMr. Scovill was married February 16, 1819, to Miss Jemima Beebe. Mrs. S.\r\nis still living and enjoying excellent health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMelancthon Barnett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who has had occasion to traverse Bank street many times, or to pass\r\nalong Superior at the head of Bank, must have become familiar with the\r\nfigure of a hale old gentleman, to be seen frequently on sunny days,\r\nstanding on the steps of the Merchants Bank, or passing along Bank street\r\nbetween the bank and his residence, beyond Lake street. His clothes are\r\nnot of showy material or fashionable cut, one hand is generally employed\r\nin holding a clay pipe, from which he draws comfort and inspiration, and\r\nwhich rarely leaves his lips when on the street, except to utter some bit\r\nof dry humor, in which he especially delights. That is Melancthon Barnett,\r\none of the \"oldest inhabitants\" of the Forest City, and whose well known\r\nfigure and quaint jokes will be missed by his many friends out of doors,\r\nas will his wise counsels within the bank parlor, when death shall at\r\nlength summon him to leave his wonted haunts.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett was born in Amenia, Dutchess county, New York, in 1789. At six\r\nyears old he was taken with the remainder of the family to Oneida county,\r\nwhere he remained until 1812, when he removed to New Hartford, near Utica,\r\nand remained two years as clerk in a store. From that place he went to\r\nCherry Valley, Otsego County, where he went as partner in the mercantile\r\nbusiness, and continued there until 1825. In that year Mr. May came west\r\nto Cleveland for the purpose of opening a store, and Mr. Barnett came with\r\nhim as clerk. In course of time he was advanced to the position of\r\npartner, and continued in business until 1834, when May and Barnett wound\r\nup their affairs as merchants, and became speculators in land. Their real\r\nestate business was carried on successfully for many years, the steady\r\ngrowth of the town making their investments profitable.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, Mr. Barnett was elected Treasurer of Cuyahoga county, and proved\r\nhimself one of the most capable and scrupulously honest officers the\r\ncounty has ever had. He held the position six years, and the business not\r\noccupying his entire time, he also filled the office of Justice of the\r\nPeace, continuing his real estate transactions at the same time.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his career as a public officer he was elected Director of\r\nthe City Bank, with which he has remained to the present time, rarely, if\r\never, being absent during the business hours of the bank.\r\n\r\nMr. Barnett was married May 15, 1815, to Miss Mary Clark, at Cherry\r\nValley. Mrs. Barnett died April 21, 1840, in Cleveland, having borne five\r\nchildren. Only two of these yet live, the oldest, Augustus, being in the\r\nleather business at Watertown, Wisconsin, and the younger, James, in the\r\nhardware business in Cleveland. The latter is well known for his brilliant\r\nservices at the head of the Ohio Artillery during the war, in Western\r\nVirginia and Tennessee, and no name is cherished with greater pride in\r\nCleveland than that of General James Barnett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoel Scranton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoel Scranton, whose name is associated with much of the history of\r\nCleveland, during the period when it grew from a small village to a city\r\nwell on the way to permanent prosperity, was born in Belchertown, Mass.,\r\nApril 5, 1792. Whilst yet a child his parents removed with him to Otsego\r\ncounty, N. Y., where a considerable portion of his early life was spent.\r\nAbout the year 1820 he removed to Cleveland, where he engaged in business\r\nand remained until his death, of apoplexy, on the 9th of April, 1858,\r\nhaving just completed his sixty-sixth year.\r\n\r\nIn the later years of the village of Cleveland and the early days of the\r\ncity, Mr. Scranton's leather and dry goods store, at the corner of\r\nSuperior and Water streets, was a well known business landmark. In the\r\nprosecution of his business he succeeded in saving a comfortable\r\ncompetence, which was increased by his judicious investments in real\r\nestate. These last have, by the rapid growth of the city, and increase in\r\nvalue since his death, become highly valuable property.\r\n\r\nMr. Scranton was industrious, economical, and judicious in business\r\ntransactions; of strong mind and well balanced judgment; a kind parent and\r\na firm friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrlando Cutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrlando Cutter first beheld the harbor and city of Cleveland on the 30th\r\nof June, 1818, having spent nine dismal days on the schooner Ben Franklin,\r\nin the passage from Black Rock. He was landed in a yawl, at the mouth of\r\nthe river, near a bluff that stood where the Toledo Railroad Machine Shops\r\nhave since been built, about seventy-five rods west of the present\r\nentrance to the harbor. In those days the river entrance was of a very\r\nunreliable character, being sometimes entirely blocked up with sand, so\r\nthat people walked across. It was no uncommon thing for people to ride\r\nover, or jump the outlet with the help of a pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Cutter walked along the beach and on the old road to Water street,\r\nand thence in a broiling sun to the frame tavern of Noble H. Merwin, on\r\nVineyard lane, near Superior street. Here he was first introduced to Philo\r\nScovill, a robust young carpenter, who was hewing timber for Merwin's new\r\nbrick tavern, afterwards called the Mansion House.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutter had experienced what our city boys would regard as a rough\r\nbeginning in life. At sixteen he went into a store at Royalton,\r\nMassachusetts, at a salary of _four dollars a month_ and board; and at the\r\nend of a year had saved one dollar and a half. His pay being increased to\r\none hundred dollars for the next year, he ventured upon the luxury of a\r\npair of boots. In September, 1815, having proven his mettle as an active,\r\ncapable and honest young man, he was translated to a large jobbing house,\r\non Cornhill, Boston, the salary being board and clothing. Having been born\r\nat Jeffrey, New Hampshire, June 5, 1797, at the end of three years\r\napprenticeship in the Boston establishment, he arrived at the age of\r\ntwenty-one, and became his own master. The firm offered him a credit for\r\ndry goods to the amount of $10,000, with which to go west and seek his\r\nfortune, but before accepting the offer he concluded to go and see if he\r\ncould find a suitable place for trade, but as he had no money, it was\r\nnecessary to borrow $400 for the expenses of the trip. With a pair of well\r\nfilled saddlebags as an outfit, he started, and in due time arrived at\r\nBlack Rock, and from thence proceeded, as above narrated, to Cleveland, on\r\na tour of examination.\r\n\r\nCleveland had then about two hundred inhabitants, and four stores. Water\r\nstreet was cleared out sufficiently for the purposes of travel to the\r\nlake. It was also prepared for a race course--for which purpose it was\r\nused for a number of years.\r\n\r\nTwenty or thirty German teams from Pennsylvania, Stark, Wayne and other\r\ncounties, laden with flour, each team having from four to six horses,\r\nencamped in Superior street at night, and gave Cleveland such a business\r\nappearance that Mr. Cutter took a fancy to it.\r\n\r\nAfter two weeks, Mr. Cutter set sail in the schooner Wasp for Sandusky,\r\nwhere there was a natural harbor, and from thence in the Fire Fly, for\r\nDetroit. But his thoughts reverted to Cleveland, and forming a partnership\r\nwith Messrs. Mack & Conant, of Detroit, the firm purchased twenty\r\nthousand dollars worth of dry goods, groceries, and a general assortment\r\nfor an extensive establishment here.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1820, he married Miss Phelps, of Painesville, Ohio, who died\r\nin 1829, two of whose children are now living. His competitors in business\r\nwere Nathan Perry, J. R. & I. Kelly, S. S. Dudley and Dr. David Long. It\r\nwas only about a year after he opened in Cleveland when Mack & Conant\r\nfailed, throwing the Cleveland purchase entirely upon him. After ten years\r\nof hard work, and close application, he paid off the whole, but at the\r\nclose it left him only five hundred dollars in old goods. Ohio currency\r\nwas not exactly money in those days. It was at a discount of twenty-five\r\nto thirty per cent. for eastern funds. There was, moreover, little of it,\r\nand there were stay laws, and the appraisal of personal, as well as real\r\nestate, under execution, rendering collections almost impossible. To\r\nillustrate: a man in Middleburg, Cuyahoga county, Ohio, owed Mr. Cutter\r\nseventy-five dollars. He went to attend the constable's sale, and found\r\namong the effects a dog appraised at ten dollars; rails ten cents each,\r\nand a watch worth five dollars valued at twenty dollars, so he left the\r\nplace in disgust and hurried home, through the woods, in no placid frame\r\nof mind. Of four new shoes put on his horse that morning, three had been\r\ntorn off by the mud, roots, and corduroy between Cleveland and Middleburg.\r\n\r\nAfter closing up the old business, he posted books or turned his hand\r\nto whatever employment presented itself. Inactivity and despondency\r\nformed no part of his character. About 1827, there was a temporary\r\nbusiness connection between himself and Thos. M. Kelly, after which he\r\nstarted again alone, adding the auction and commission business to that\r\nof a merchant.\r\n\r\nMr. Cutter, in November, 1832, was married to Miss Hilliard, sister of the\r\nlate Richard Hilliard. Of this marriage there are seven children now\r\nliving, most of them settled in the city. William L. is cashier of the\r\nMerchants National Bank; Edwin succeeded his father two years since at the\r\nold auction store in Bank street, and R. H. is the principal partner of\r\nCutter & Co., upholsterers.\r\n\r\nGoing east in the Fall of 1821, Mr. Cutter, on his return, preferred the\r\nstaunch steamer Walk-in-the-Water, to the Wasps, Fire Flies and Franklins,\r\non board of which he had experienced so many buffetings. George Williams\r\nand John S. Strong were also of the same mind. These three old settlers,\r\nand about seventy others, went on board at Black Rock, in the afternoon.\r\nEight yoke of oxen were required to assist the engines in getting her over\r\nthe rapids into the open lake. In the night a furious gale arose, Capt.\r\nRogers put back, but not being able to get into Buffalo Creek, came to\r\nanchor near its mouth. Being awfully sea sick, Mr. Cutter lay below,\r\nlittle caring where the Walk-in-the-Water went to. Her anchor, however,\r\nparted before morning, and she went ashore sidewise, on an easy sand\r\nbeach, without loss of life.\r\n\r\nThis year completes his semi-centennial as a citizen of Cleveland, yet he\r\nis still hale and vigorous. He has gone through revulsions, and has\r\nenjoyed prosperity with equal equanimity, never indulging in idleness or\r\nease, and has now come to a ripe old age possessed of an ample competence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Martin Weddell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted historical and topographical landmarks of Cleveland\r\nis the Weddell House. Its builder was one of the most valuable citizens of\r\nthe Forest City.\r\n\r\nMr. P. M. Weddell was born in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, in 1788.\r\nHis father died before his birth, and his mother, marrying again, removed\r\nto Paris, Bourbon county, Kentucky, the State at that time deserving its\r\nsobriquet of the \"dark and bloody ground,\" as the contest with the native\r\nsavages was carried on with relentless fury on both sides. Under such\r\ncircumstances it may well be supposed that he grew up with few educational\r\nor other advantages, and that his youth was one of vicissitudes and\r\nhardships.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fourteen he applied at a store for employment, what surplus\r\nclothing and effects he then possessed being carelessly flung over his\r\nshoulders. He promised to do any work they were pleased to set him at, and\r\nhe thought he could satisfy them. This broad pledge was so well kept that\r\nat the age of nineteen he was made a partner. This partnership was soon\r\nclosed by the death of the old member.\r\n\r\nYoung Weddell, with a vigorous body, good habits, a clear judgment, and\r\nsome money, removed to Newark, Ohio, during the war of 1812. While he was\r\nsuccessfully trading there, Miss Sophia Perry, of Cleveland, was sent to\r\nher friends at Newark for greater safety, and to acquire an education.\r\nShe was but little past fifteen when she consented to be Mrs. Weddell, and\r\nthey were married in November, 1815.\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Mr. Weddell removed from Newark to Cleveland and established\r\nhimself in business on Superior street, taking a stand at once among the\r\nleading merchants of the place, a position he retained as long as he\r\ncontinued in business.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, Mrs. Weddell died, leaving three children, of whom H. P. Weddell\r\nis the only survivor. A portrait of her, by Peale, still remains in the\r\nfamily house, which confirms the remembrances of her friends that she\r\npossessed many charms both of person and of disposition. In the\r\nfollowing year Mr. Weddell married Mrs. Eliza A. Bell, of Newark, who is\r\nstill living, and whom every old citizen of Cleveland well knows and\r\nsincerely respects.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, he formed a partnership with Mr. Edmund Clade, from Buffalo, and\r\nretired from active participation in business. In 1828, the partnership\r\nwas dissolved. Three years afterwards he took into partnership with him\r\nhis two clerks, Greenup C. Woods, his half brother, and Dudley Baldwin,\r\nthe firm name being P. M. Weddell & Co. The firm lasted but four years,\r\nwhen Mr. Woods established himself in Newark, and Messrs. Weddell and\r\nBaldwin continued the business together until 1845.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Weddell commenced his mercantile life it was no child's play.\r\nAt that time there were no canals or railroads to facilitate\r\ncommerce--scarcely were there any roads at all--specie was the only\r\ncurrency west of the mountains, and that had to be carried across the\r\nmountains from Pittsburgh on the backs of mules, and the merchandise\r\nreturned in the same way. Long after, when traveling over the\r\nAlleghanies with a friend, Mr. Weddell frequently pointed to places on\r\nthe road which he remembered, and of which he related interesting\r\nanecdotes. Several merchants would travel together and sometimes they\r\nwould have guards, as the lonely uninhabited mountains were not\r\naltogether safe even in those days.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, Mr. Weddell built what was regarded as a princely brick residence\r\nand store on the corner of Superior and Bank streets, afterwards the site\r\nof the Weddell House. His surplus funds were invested in real estate,\r\nwhich soon began to increase in value at an astonishing rate, as the city\r\ngrew in population and importance. On one of his lots upon Euclid street\r\nhe built the stone cottage which he designed as a country retreat, and\r\nafter his taking his clerks into partnership, he left the store mainly to\r\ntheir management, devoting his attention to the purchase and improvement\r\nof real estate, being generally regarded as a gentleman of wealth.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1845 he began work upon the Weddell House, tearing away\r\nthe store and mansion, where his fortune had been made. It was finished in\r\ntwo years. He then made a journey to New York to purchase furniture. On\r\nthe way home he was attacked by typhoid fever, and in three weeks was in\r\nhis grave.\r\n\r\nAs a merchant, Mr. Weddell had few superiors. His urbanity, industry,\r\nand care made him popular, successful, and safe, while his integrity and\r\nhis liberality were well known to his correspondents and to all the\r\nreligious and benevolent institutions of the times.\r\n\r\nHe was always willing and ready to aid and assist his young men; when he\r\nfound one correct and capable he never refused a helping hand. Very few of\r\nhis day were so liberal in this respect, or could point to so many who\r\nbecame prominent merchants by their aid as could Mr. Weddell.\r\n\r\nAt his death, Mr. Weddell was a man of such personal energy and business\r\ncapacity, that he had promise of twenty more years of active life. Soon\r\nafter the Rev. S. G. Aiken became pastor of the old Stone Church, Mr.\r\nWeddell became a communicant, and he died in the Christian faith. He\r\nbequeathed to the American Board of Foreign Missions the sum of five\r\nthousand dollars; to the Home Missionary Society five thousand dollars,\r\nand several other bequests amounting to some thousands to other benevolent\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDudley Baldwin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1819, Dudley Baldwin came to Cleveland from Ballston, New York, having\r\nas his principal capital a fair common school education. In course of time\r\nbe found employment in the mercantile store of Mr. Weddell, and became one\r\nof his trusted clerks, being, after a few years, taken into partnership.\r\nThe death of Mr. Weddell in 1847, terminated a connection that had existed\r\npleasantly for over twenty years.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years Mr. Baldwin was chiefly engaged in closing up the\r\naffairs of Mr. Weddell, after which he engaged for a time in the\r\nmanufacture of agricultural implements, until, from ill heath, he was\r\ncompelled to relinquish business and seek restoration of health by travel\r\nand in quiet retirement.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin was identified with the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad from\r\nits inception, and during the darkest days of the undertaking he stood\r\nfirmly by it, in connection with the other directors, never losing faith\r\nin its ultimate success--a success he has lived to see perfected. He has\r\nalso, for a number of years, been a director of the Commercial Bank of\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nIn religious principles Mr. Baldwin is a Presbyterian, and has long\r\nbeen connected with the Euclid street Presbyterian Church. He is known\r\nto all his acquaintances as a man of quiet unassuming manners, and of\r\nsterling worth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorman C. Baldwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVery many of those who settled on the Western Reserve, in the early days\r\nof its history, came from Connecticut, and the fact of so many Connecticut\r\nfamilies being already here induced considerable emigration from that\r\nState long after the first rush was over. Among others of Connecticut\r\nbirth who found their way eventually to Cleveland, was Norman C. Baldwin,\r\nborn at Litchfield, July 29th, 1802, and spending his early years in the\r\nstruggles which so many of the New England families of limited resources\r\nhad to pass through in the early portion of the present century.\r\n\r\nWhilst yet but a mere child he assisted his father in the work of the\r\nfarm, but being left fatherless at the age of eight, he was sent two years\r\nafterwards to work in his cousin's store, where he remained four years. In\r\nhis fourteenth year he left Litchfield for New Haven, where he found\r\nemployment for a year with a provision packer.\r\n\r\nAt that time his mother joined the stream of emigration setting towards\r\nthe Ohio, and with her came her children. Stopping at Hudson, Summit\r\ncounty, young Baldwin commenced trading on his own account, and built up\r\na good business, which he managed alone for eighteen months and then\r\nformed a partnership with two of his brothers, the partnership lasting\r\neight years. Then the firm was dissolved and Norman C. came to\r\nCleveland, where he formed a partnership with Noble H. Merwin in the\r\ngeneral produce business.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, the firm of Giddings, Baldwin & Co., which had succeeded that of\r\nMerwin & Baldwin, contained seven partners, of whom Mr. Baldwin is the\r\nonly survivor. The business was mainly forwarding and commission, the\r\nforwarding being mostly by canal. The firm was one of the most important\r\non the lakes, owning a line of boats, the Troy and Erie, from Portsmouth,\r\non the Ohio river, to New York In those days the canal lines carried\r\npassengers as well as freight, the boats usually taking about thirty\r\npassengers and one thousand bushels of wheat. For emigrants, of whom many\r\nwere pouring into the West, special boats were fitted up with\r\naccommodations, such as they were, for about a hundred and fifty\r\npassengers. In 1836, Mr. Baldwin left the mercantile business altogether,\r\nand thereafter devoted his attention to operations in real estate.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the growth of the city and the consequent increasing value\r\nof city property, Mr. Baldwin relates having purchased in 1833 three\r\nparcels of land, neither of which cost over two thousand dollars, which\r\nare now estimated to be worth half a million of dollars each. In 1831, he\r\nwas offered, in the course of his operations, a strip of land fronting on\r\nSuperior street and running back to the canal, with a comfortable frame\r\nhouse thereon, for one thousand dollars. The price looked high and Mr.\r\nBaldwin, distrusting his own judgment, consulted 'Squire Cowles, then a\r\nprominent attorney. Mr. Cowles hesitated, thought the investment somewhat\r\nrisky, although they might live to see the land worth thirty dollars a\r\nfoot front. Heeding his own fears, which were not abated by the doubtful\r\nopinion of his adviser, Mr. Baldwin refused to purchase. That same land is\r\nworth now not merely thirty dollars a foot, but equivalent to three or\r\nfour thousand dollars a foot front.\r\n\r\nAs showing the condition of the roads around Cleveland, and the mode of\r\ntraveling in the early days of its history, it is narrated by Mr. Baldwin,\r\nthat when living in Hudson he was fond of good horses and kept a team of\r\nwhich he was proud. The distance between Hudson and Cleveland was but\r\ntwenty-four miles, but that distance had never been done in one day by any\r\nteam. Mr. Baldwin thought the time had come for performing the feat, and\r\naccordingly set out on the journey. Just at tea time he drew rein in front\r\nof Merwin's tavern, at the corner of Superior street and Vineyard lane,\r\nand shouted to the landlord. The guests had just seated themselves to tea\r\nwhen Mr. Merwin rushed into the room in a state of great excitement,\r\nexclaiming, \"For God's sake, gentlemen, come out and see a team that has\r\nbeen driven from Hudson to-day!\" The guests left the table in a hurry and\r\nrushed to the door, scarcely crediting their own eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin was married in 1829, and lost his wife in the Spring of 1867.\r\nOf this marriage there are now six children living and three dead. One\r\nson, Norman A., is engaged in agriculture in the neighborhood of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeverett Alcott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeverett Alcott was born in Walcott, New Haven county, Connecticut, in\r\n1820. From early boyhood his taste was for mercantile pursuits. At the age\r\nof seventeen he obtained a position in an extensive country store at\r\nBristol Basin, on the Farmington Canal, (now Plainville.) By diligence and\r\nperseverance, he was soon promoted from the duties of errand boy to a\r\nresponsible position, and in course of time stood at the head of all the\r\nclerks in the establishment.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of neophytes in commercial life, it may not be\r\nuninteresting to state how boys were made merchants in those days, and the\r\nremuneration they received for services. They were not (as is too often\r\nthe case at the present time) transformed in a few months from crude green\r\nboys to merchants, but were obliged to learn the business by actual\r\nexperience. An arrangement was made in this case for three years, on the\r\nfollowing conditions: fifty dollars for the first year, seventy-five\r\ndollars for the second year, and one hundred dollars for the third and\r\nlast year, with board in his employer's family. With this modest salary it\r\nrequired the utmost care and rigid economy to clothe and keep himself; but\r\nwhere there's a will there's a way, and the economy thus practiced in\r\nearly life was no detriment in laying the foundation for a sound business\r\ncareer in after life. After having fulfilled his engagement with his\r\nemployer, he spent some three years of mercantile life at the South, but\r\nthe customs of the country, and the barbarous system of slavery were so\r\nrepulsive to his feelings that he abandoned that field for the more\r\ncongenial and prospectively profitable activities of the West, and in\r\nDecember, 1842, landed at Medina, in this State. In the Spring of 1845, a\r\nmercantile copartnership was formed with Mr. Augustus W. North, under the\r\nfirm name of North & Alcott. During the subsequent Fall he married Miss\r\nMary A. Williams, with the view of permanently settling at that place, but\r\nthe mercantile prospects, and the growth of the town not appearing\r\nsatisfactory to his views, the firm of North & Alcott was dissolved and\r\nthe business discontinued, to be reconstructed and opened in a wider field\r\nand on a broader basis. Accordingly, in the Spring of 1849, (just twenty\r\nyears ago,) a business arrangement was entered into with his present\r\npartner, Mr. Burrett W. Horton, a former school mate, under the firm name\r\nof Alcott & Horton. The business was to be the retailing of dry goods, and\r\nlocated at 177 Superior street, in Harrington's Block. The beginning was a\r\nmoderate one, with a very limited capital, but what was lacking in capital\r\nwas made up in energy, industry and perseverance. At first a retail trade\r\nonly was contemplated, which was continued some four years, when the rapid\r\ngrowth of the city and increase of business induced them to open a\r\nwholesale department in the lofts of their store. Subsequently they closed\r\ntheir retail business and occupied the whole building for their jobbing\r\ntrade; but their apartments were soon found to be too strait for their\r\nrapidly growing trade, and in August, 1855, they removed to the large new\r\nstore, No. 141, in Clark's Block.\r\n\r\nMr. Alcott has a knowledge of human nature that imparts a keen perception\r\nof the character and motives of men, and hence, almost instinctively knows\r\nwhom to trust. He is also quick in forming his judgment, ready in the\r\nadaptation of means to secure an end, vigorously prosecutes his plans, and\r\nseldom fails of a successful issue.\r\n\r\nIn a young and vigorous country like the United States, where so many\r\nopportunities are offered to ambition and laudable enterprise, and where\r\ntoo often, everything else but gold is lost sight of, it is refreshing to\r\nfind some among our heaviest merchants, who recognize the fact, that man\r\n\"cannot live by bread alone.\" Mr. Alcott, through all his active life has\r\nfound time to attend to his religious duties. He has been for a long time\r\nconnected with the Second Presbyterian Church, and for many years one of\r\nits elders. He was formerly President of the Young Men's Christian\r\nAssociation; actively engaged in missionary Sunday School work in the\r\ncity--taking a lively interest in all Christian labor; a ready and willing\r\ngiver toward public improvements, and all benevolent enterprises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Winslow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of Sunday, August 9th, 1857, died, at nearly the ripe age\r\nof eighty-eight, Richard Winslow, the father of the Winslow family that\r\nhave filled so important a place in the commercial and shipping history of\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nMr. Winslow was born in Falmouth, Maine, September 6th, 1769, being\r\ndescended in a direct line from Knelm Winslow, brother of Governor Edward\r\nWinslow, who played so important a part in the early history of Plymouth\r\ncolony. In 1812, Mr. Winslow removed to North Carolina, where he lived\r\nfor fourteen years, at Ocracoke, becoming largely interested in commerce,\r\nboth internal and marine. Soon after his removal to that State, he\r\nmarried Miss Mary Nash Grandy, of Camden, N. C., who became the mother of\r\neleven children, of whom but four, N. C., H. J., R. K., and Edward, are now\r\nalive. Mrs. Winslow died October, 1858, having survived her husband a\r\nlittle over one year.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, he decided to leave North Carolina and try his fortune in the\r\nWest. A preliminary tour of observation brought him to Cleveland, then\r\nlively with business, and more lively still with expectancy of business to\r\ncome from the completion of the canal, then in partial operation. Like\r\nmany who preceded, and more who followed him, Mr. Winslow was struck with\r\nthe natural advantages of Cleveland and concluded to try his fortunes\r\nhere. The site of what is now known as the \"Winslow warehouse,\" on the\r\nriver, was owned by C. M. Giddings and Captain Belden, and a building was\r\nthen in course of erection on it. Mr. Winslow purchased the property. He\r\nhad strong faith in the growth of the city, but others did not have it to\r\nthe same extent, and he was strongly urged not to attempt business so far\r\ndown the river, where it was impossible that trade would ever reach him.\r\n\r\nImmediately on concluding his purchase, he went to the eastern cities,\r\nwhere he purchased a large stock of teas and groceries, which he sent with\r\nhis son, N. C., to Cleveland in the Fall. The stock arrived in December and\r\nwas at once opened on Superior street, opposite Union lane. In the\r\nfollowing May, Mr. Winslow followed with his family, purchased a lot on\r\nthe south-east corner of the Public Square, and contracted with Levi\r\nJohnson for the erection of the house that was occupied by the Winslow\r\nfamily until the death of Mr. Winslow.\r\n\r\nUnlike most of the early settlers in Cleveland, Mr. Winslow came with\r\ncapital to invest at once in business, and by prudent management and far\r\nseeing enterprise that capital rapidly increased. He soon became agent for\r\na line of vessels between Buffalo and Cleveland, and also of a line of\r\ncanal boats. The first step toward his own shipping interests here, which\r\nsubsequently assumed such proportions, was commenced by building the brig\r\nNorth Carolina. A few years later he was interested in building the\r\nsteamer Bunker Hill, of 456 tons, which at that time was considered a very\r\nlarge size. To these were added, by himself and his sons, so many other\r\nlake craft that the family ranked among the foremost, if not the very\r\nforemost ship-owners on the chain of lakes, their sail vessels, propellers\r\nand steam-tugs being found everywhere on the western lake waters.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, Mr. Winslow retired from business, leaving his interest to be\r\ncarried on by his sons, who inherited their father's business qualities.\r\nIn his retirement, as in his active business life, he enjoyed the\r\nfriendship of a very large social circle, to whom his frank, generous\r\nmanners, warm attachments, and spotless honor commended him. He was a\r\nfavorable specimen of the old school gentleman, warm and impulsive in his\r\nnature, quick to conceive and prompt to act, cordial in his greeting,\r\nstrong in his attachments, and courteous to all.\r\n\r\nHis death was accelerated by an accident which seriously injured a leg he\r\nhad badly injured several years before. To the last he preserved his\r\nfaculties and his cheerfulness, and but for the injuries he had received\r\nwould probably have lived for many years longer.\r\n\r\nHe was no politician, never sought office, but at the same time took a\r\nkeen interest in public affairs, and did not neglect his duties or\r\nprivileges as a citizen.\r\n\r\nThe three brothers in active conduct of the large marine interests known\r\nas the Winslows', are distributed as follows: N. C. at Buffalo, H. J. at\r\nNew York, and R. K. at Cleveland, all of whom have been eminently\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Hilliard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst Cleveland's earliest merchants who have already passed away, none\r\ndeserve more honorable mention than Richard Hilliard. Like nearly all our\r\nmen of mark, in early life he was obliged to sail against wind and tide.\r\nHe was born at Chatham, New York, July 3, 1797. His father, David\r\nHilliard, died when Richard was 14 years of age, he being at the time\r\nserving an apprenticeship with a hatter named Dore, at Albany. He was a\r\nlad of superior organization, and so, although obedient and obliging, had\r\nan extreme distaste for drudgery. A son of Mr. Dore one day threw down a\r\npair of boots, saying, \"Clean those boots Dick,\" when the lad concluded he\r\nwould not do it, and at once prepared to leave for parts unknown. None of\r\nhis friends knew of his whereabouts for several months, but at length\r\nlearned he was at Skaneateles, with an older brother. Here he remained\r\nuntil he was about 18 years of age, being employed at clerking and school\r\nteaching, and ever mindful of his widowed mother and fatherless sisters.\r\n\r\nFrom Skaneateles he removed to Black Rock and engaged himself as clerk to\r\nMr. John Daly, a general merchant at that place. The young man soon gained\r\nthe confidence of his employer and was admitted as a partner without\r\ncapital. After a year or two, the firm moved to Cleveland, as a place of\r\ngreater promise for trade. This occurred in 1824. They at once commenced\r\nbusiness in the same line here on the site of the present Atwater Block,\r\nin a frame building of two compartments, one of which was used for dry\r\ngoods, and the other for groceries. Mr. Daly was not an active partner in\r\nthe business here, having given the entire management to Mr. Hilliard.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, Mr. Hilliard purchased Mr. Daly's entire interest, and continued\r\nalone for several years, till at length the demands of trade making it\r\ndesirable to have a resident partner in New York to make purchases, he\r\nassociated with himself Mr. William Hays, of that city. This partnership\r\nexisted till the close of Mr. Hilliard's life.\r\n\r\nAs soon as business prospects warranted the investment, Mr. Hilliard\r\nsecured a lot on Water street, and erected the block now occupied by\r\nRaymond & Lowe, and on taking possession of the new place of business,\r\ncommenced the wholesale branch, and continued the same until 1856, when,\r\nbeing on his way home from New York, he took a severe cold, which was soon\r\nfollowed by congestion, and after one week's illness, died, deeply\r\nregretted by all who knew him.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of great business ability, and of strict integrity. He was\r\nnot always appreciated, because his accurate foresight led him to advocate\r\nprojects which the public generally were not ready to adopt. He labored\r\nmost indefatigably for the construction of our Water Works, because he saw\r\nwhat the future wants of the city would be. The scheme was strongly\r\nopposed by many on account of the debt it would involve. But it was\r\nfinally accomplished, and we are more indebted to Richard Hilliard for its\r\nachievement than to any other man.\r\n\r\nShortly after coming to Cleveland he became engaged to Miss Mary Merwin,\r\ndaughter of Noble H. Merwin, who died before the marriage. He then brought\r\nhis sister Sarah A. (now Mrs. O. Cutter) to live with him. In about a year\r\nfrom this time he was married to Miss Catharine Hays, of New York, who\r\ndied about four years before Mr. Hilliard, leaving seven children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS. H. Sheldon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lumber trade has grown to be a very important branch of the commerce\r\nof Cleveland, and some of its best and most enterprising citizens have\r\nbeen, or are now, engaged in it. Among these the name of Mr. Sheldon holds\r\nhonorable prominence as one of the earliest in the trade, and who has\r\nalways held place among the foremost engaged in it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sheldon's birth place was in Clinton, Oneida county, N. Y., where he\r\nwas born August 12th, 1813. His early days were not passed among thornless\r\nroses. His father, a hard working farmer, died when the future lumber\r\nmerchant was but eight years old. Young Sheldon remained on the homestead\r\nuntil he was sixteen years old, working hard, as did the others of the\r\nfatherless family, and snatching such crumbs of knowledge as could be\r\nobtained in the winter days, when time could be spared for schooling. On\r\nnearly reaching his sixteenth year, he went to Troy, N. Y., where he was\r\nreceived as an apprentice to the drug business, and served seven years in\r\nthat capacity. As soon as his term of apprenticeship expired he set his\r\nface westward in search of fortune, as so many hundreds had done before\r\nhim, and hundreds of thousands have done since.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, he reached Cleveland and at once started in trade as a\r\ndruggist on Detroit Street, then in Ohio City, but now the West Side of\r\nCleveland. At that time the West, generally, was enjoying seeming\r\nprosperity; everything was inflated and everyone was growing rich, on\r\npaper. Ohio City was then the city of the future, and fortune smiled on\r\nall its residents, and particularly on those who held real estate within\r\nits borders.\r\n\r\nFour years later the commercial earthquake came and toppled over the whole\r\nfabric of trade and commerce in the West, reducing it to ruins. The entire\r\nWest was devastated, and Ohio City received a blow from which, as a\r\nseparate municipality, it never recovered. Among the others who suffered\r\ngreatly by the disaster was Mr. Sheldon.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, he sold out his drug business, and went into the employ of\r\nanother firm as an accountant, continuing in that position about two\r\nyears. From this he went into business on his own account once more, this\r\ntime dealing in groceries and provisions, which he continued to trade in\r\nuntil 1846, when he was attracted to the lumber trade, which he entered,\r\nin partnership with S. H. Fox. Four years later he disposed of his\r\ninterest in the firm, and operated in lumber on his own account, not\r\nkeeping a yard, but buying and selling by the cargo. In 1852, the firm of\r\nSheldon & French was formed, a lumber yard opened, and the firm continued\r\nuntil the failure of the health of Mr. C. French. For a year after this\r\nevent Mr. Sheldon carried on his business alone, and then took into\r\npartnership his son, Edward P. Sheldon, the firm becoming Sheldon & Son.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1869, the firm of Sheldon & Son merged into that of S. H.\r\nSheldon & Co., being comprised of S. H. Sheldon & Son, and Sears &\r\nHolland, of East Saginaw, Mich.\r\n\r\nThe lumber trade of the city has been, generally, one of steady growth,\r\nand Mr. Sheldon's share in it has been of that character. It developed\r\ngradually, as the city grew in size and importance, and as the demand from\r\nthe interior increased with the growth of towns and villages on the lines\r\nof canal and railroads. The beginning was small, and the earlier years of\r\nits progress full of difficulties, but in the end the trade reached large\r\nand lucrative proportions. Its highest point of prosperity was during the\r\nwar, when the establishment of permanent camps through the State created a\r\nsudden and extensive demand for lumber, to build the numerous camp\r\nbuildings. At that time the only perplexity of the lumber dealer was to\r\nfind a supply sufficient for the demands pressing in from all quarters,\r\nfor certain qualities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, S. H. Sheldon]\r\n\r\nFrom lumber to ship building is an easy transition, and Mr. Sheldon, five\r\nor six years since, became interested in lake craft, and added a fine\r\nthree masted schooner to the lake marine. With the growth of manufactures\r\nin the city, he became interested in that direction also, connecting\r\nhimself with the Etna Iron and Nail Works enterprise. He also took a deep\r\ninterest in the formation of the People's Gas Company, for the supply of\r\nthe West Side with gas, being one of the original supporters of the\r\norganization, and at present one of its directors.\r\n\r\nIn all his undertakings Mr. Sheldon has kept steadily in view the\r\nnecessity of industry and economy, and it is the practice of these two\r\nmercantile virtues that has brought about his success. One trait of his\r\nbusiness character is peculiar. He has, so far as possible, avoided\r\nrecourse to law, holding the doctrine that, in most cases, when a debt\r\ncould not be collected without the aid of a lawyer, it was not worth\r\nspending money for. In religious principles Mr. Sheldon is a\r\nCongregationalist, and has been connected for more than thirty years with\r\nthe First Congregational Church, and during most of this time has\r\ndischarged the duties of deacon, serving the church with fidelity and\r\nacceptance, in this official position. He has been identified with Sabbath\r\nschool labors, as teacher and superintendent, and to his zeal and\r\nliberality the Detroit street Mission Sabbathe school largely owes its\r\nprosperity, and its present commodious chapel. In every Christian\r\nenterprise Deacon Sheldon has been among the foremost. No benevolent\r\ncause, whether local or general, has appealed to him in vain for pecuniary\r\nsupport, or Christian sympathy and countenance.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Mr. Sheldon was married to Miss Cordelia H. Buxton, of Cleveland,\r\na descendent of the English Buxtons, of philanthropic memory. Of the\r\nfamily of six children, one, the eldest, Henry A. Sheldon, died in 1842.\r\nThe only surviving son became a partner with his father in 1866.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Hickox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the conversion of wheat into flour can more properly be classed\r\namong manufactures or trade and commerce is a question for casuists to\r\ndetermine. There can be no question, however, that Charles Hickox takes\r\nhis place, by right, among the merchants and commercial men of Cleveland,\r\nwhether the grinding of wheat be a manufacture or not, for it is not alone\r\nby the milling business that Mr. Hickox has identified himself with the\r\ncommerce of the city. He has gone through all the phases of Cleveland\r\ncommercial life, having been connected with the produce and commission\r\ntrade, owned lake vessels, and otherwise qualified himself for a place\r\namong the merchants and \"river men,\" aside from the business in which he\r\nis widely known--that of an extensive mill owner.\r\n\r\nMr. Hickox came to Cleveland in 1837, from the state of New York, making\r\nhis debut in the Forest City in the year of its greatest depression. For\r\nthe first two years he engaged as clerk, and served his employers\r\nfaithfully. Then, gaining confidence, and seeing an opening he struck out\r\nboldly for himself, setting up, as was usual in those days, in the\r\ncommission and produce business. The constantly growing commerce of the\r\nplace increased his business and made it lucrative. With far-seeing\r\nenterprise Mr. Hickox pushed his operations so that his trade rapidly\r\nincreased and his consignments steadily grew in number and quantity. To\r\naccommodate it he purchased interests in shipping on the lake, and\r\neventually became a large ship owner.\r\n\r\nSeeing his opportunity, Mr. Hickox turned his attention to milling, and\r\ncommenced operations at a mill in Akron, which he soon made known to the\r\ncommercial world by the excellence and reliability of its brand. To this\r\nwas, in time, added the water mill, on the canal, in Cleveland, near the\r\nweigh lock, which he held for five years and then sold. After the sale of\r\nthe latter mill, he purchased the Cleveland Steam Mills on Merwin street,\r\nwith a capacity of about three hundred and fifty barrels per day, and in\r\n1867, he added the National Steam Mills, with a capacity of from five\r\nhundred to six hundred barrels daily. Whilst a large capital is invested\r\nin these mills, the number of men employed is less than in establishments\r\nwhere labor saving machinery has not been brought to such a pitch of\r\nperfection. About fifty men are directly employed in the mills, and a\r\nlarge number additional in the manufacture of barrels and sacks. A very\r\nlarge proportion of the flour from these mills is sold in sacks, from the\r\nfact that the entire product is sold in the home market, which speaks well\r\nfor the estimation in which the brands are held. Mr. Charles W. Coe is in\r\nactive partnership with Mr. Hickox, in the milling interests, the firm\r\nname being Coe & Hickox.\r\n\r\nMr. Hickox has taken deep interest in the railroad affairs of the city,\r\nand has been for some time a director of the Cleveland, Columbus &\r\nCincinnati Railroad Company. He is still as active and energetic as ever,\r\nwell preserved in body and mind, and making his positive influence felt in\r\nall departments of business in which he becomes interested. He never tires\r\nof work, and, as he says of himself, he \"holds his own well, at\r\nfifty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Sackettt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander Sackett, son of Augustus Sackett, of Sackett's Harbor, N. Y.,\r\nwas born August 17th, 1814. He received a good mercantile education in New\r\nYork City, and came from thence to Cleveland in 1835, and at once engaged\r\nin the wholesale and retail dry goods line, in the old block of Mr.\r\nWeddell, on Superior street. He continued with success in this business\r\nuntil 1854, when he went into commercial business on the river, and in\r\nwhich he remained until 1868, when he retired from trade circles to devote\r\nhis whole attention to his real estate interests.\r\n\r\nMr. Sackett was married in 1836, to Harriet, daughter of Levi Johnson,\r\nEsq., of this city. They have five children living, and have lost two. The\r\neldest daughter is the wife of Mr. Virgil T. Taylor, of this city, and the\r\nson is in his father's office.\r\n\r\nMr. Sackett is still hale, and may reasonably expect, without accident, to\r\nlong enjoy the fruit of his labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Mygatt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mygatt is a genuine pioneer of the Western Reserve, having come with\r\nhis father, Comfort S. Mygatt, at the age of ten years, to the new\r\nsettlement at Canfield, Mahoning county, Ohio, in the year 1807. He was\r\nborn at Danbury, Ct., on 14th of June, 1797, when that village had not\r\nrecovered from its conflagration by the British, during the Revolution.\r\nThere were then visible, and for many years during his boyhood, buildings\r\nwhich were charred by fires kindled by English soldiers.\r\n\r\nMr. Mygatt's father was a merchant and farmer, at Canfield. He was an\r\nactive, honest and successful man. The year previous to his emigration,\r\nhis daughter, Polly, was married, at Danbury, to the late Elisha\r\nWhittlesey, who removed at once to Canfield, Ohio. Mr. Whittlesey, his\r\nson-in-law, took the contract to clear a piece of ground for Mr. Mygatt,\r\nlaboring on the job with his axe and team.\r\n\r\nAt Danbury, George had as good an opportunity in school as any Connecticut\r\nlad could have, under the age of ten years. At Canfield there was little\r\nopportunity for gaining book knowledge. He was engaged with his father as\r\nclerk and general helper, until he was twenty years old. In 1818, he\r\nbecame clerk in the Western Reserve Bank, at Warren, and remained in that\r\nposition two years, when he engaged in mercantile business in connection\r\nwith his father-in-law, Mr. A. Adams. This partnership lasted five years,\r\nafter which he carried on the business alone until 1833.\r\n\r\nFrom 1829 to 1833, he was sheriff of Trumbull county, and had the\r\ndisagreeable office of executing the murderer, Gardner.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, Mr. Mygatt became a financier, which may be said to be his\r\nprofession. He was then appointed cashier of the Bank of Norwalk, Ohio. In\r\n1836, he was appointed cashier of the Bank of Geauga, at Painesville,\r\nOhio; and in 1846 he became President of the City Bank of Cleveland,\r\nholding the last named office until 1850. The firm of Mygatt & Brown was\r\nthen formed, for private banking, and continued until 1857.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, he was elected a member of the House of Representatives, from\r\nCuyahoga county, serving two sesssion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Respectfully, George Mygatt]\r\n\r\nThe Merchants Bank of Cleveland, in 1857, became deeply involved, by the\r\nfailure of the Ohio Life and Trust Company, of Cincinnati. Mr. Mygatt was\r\nappointed cashier at this time, when a memorable panic in finances was\r\nsweeping over the country. The bank sank a large part of its stock, but\r\nmaintained its integrity, and continued to redeem its notes.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, he retired from active business, but, with his long habits of\r\nemployment, it soon became irksome to him to be out of work, and in 1865\r\nhe became Secretary of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad Company, a\r\nposition he still retains, for the sake of being employed.\r\n\r\nA large portion of Mr. Mygatt's time and means have always been devoted to\r\nbenevolent purposes; Sunday schools, the annual contributions for the\r\npoor, the church, industrial schools, and, in fact, all charitable\r\nmovements have found in him a ready response; he will long be remembered\r\nfor his work's sake.\r\n\r\nAs a business man he was characterized by the strictest integrity, always\r\npreserving a quiet, considerate policy, and by incessant industry\r\naccomplished a great deal. For one who has reached the age of seventy-two,\r\nhe possesses remarkable vigor, and we should judge, from the position he\r\noccupies, that his mental faculties are little impaired.\r\n\r\nMr. Mygatt was married in March, 1820, to Miss Eliza Freeman, of Warren,\r\nwho is still living. Of their six children, four of whom arrived at mature\r\nage, and were married, only Mrs. F. T. Backus now survives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMartin B. Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the names of those who have done business on the river during the\r\npast quarter of a century, that of M. B. Scott, until his retirement a few\r\nyears since, held a foremost place. Mr. Scott is a native of New York,\r\nhaving been born at Deerfield, near Utica, in that State, in March, 1801.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott is of Quaker stock; a lineal descendent in the sixth generation\r\nfrom the first American Quaker, (Richard Scott, one of the first settlers\r\nof Providence, R. I.,) and in the nineteenth generation from William\r\nBaliol Scott, of Scotts-Hall, Kent, England, in the line of Edward I. His\r\nQuaker ancestors suffered persecution at the hands of the Boston Puritans\r\nin 1658. The daughters of Richard Scott were cast into prison by Endicott,\r\nfor avowing their Quaker faith, and his wife Katharine (_né_ Marbury,\r\nyoungest sister of the famous Mrs. Anne Hutchinson) was publicly scourged\r\nin Boston by order of court, for visiting and sympathizing with her Quaker\r\nbrethren in prison.\r\n\r\nOne of the maxims of Mr. Scott's life, was to despise no honest\r\nemployment, however laborious; if he failed to obtain such business as he\r\ndesired, he took the next best opportunity that offered, a principle that\r\nmight be profitably practiced by many young men of the present day.\r\nDeprived of a liberal education, by the pecuniary embarrassments of his\r\nfather, who had a large family to support, he left the Utica Academy in\r\n1820, and made an effort to learn a mechanical trade, with only partial\r\nsuccess. He, for a time, alternately taught a country school in winter,\r\nand was engaged for the remainder of the year in internal commerce, as\r\nmaster of a boat, or as forwarding clerk, in the then prominent houses of\r\nDe Graff, Walton & Co., and Cary & Dows, on the Mohawk river and Erie\r\ncanal. This early training in the elements of commerce and navigation was\r\nthe nucleus of his subsequent pursuits, and the foundation of his\r\ncommercial success, although his operations were not on the gigantic scale\r\nof many others, who either amassed great fortunes, or sank into\r\nbankruptcy; he managed his affairs with such prudence, sagacity and\r\nintegrity, that he never had occasion to compound with his creditors, or\r\neven ask for an extension.\r\n\r\nMr. Scott was interested in the first line of canal boats that ran through\r\nfrom Utica to New York. In the outset of Erie canal operations it was\r\nsupposed that canal boats could not sail down the Hudson, and the freight\r\nwas consequently transhipped at Albany. Experiment proved the fallacy of\r\nthis belief, and thenceforward canal boats ran through to New York. A new\r\nline of steam tow-boats on the North river, called the Albany & Canal\r\nTow-Boat Company, was formed, and Mr. Scott was appointed principal\r\nmanager, first at Albany and then at New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, his health failed, owing to his close application to business,\r\nand under medical advice he performed a horseback journey through\r\nMichigan, Indiana, Illinois and Wisconsin. On his way westward he stopped\r\nat Cleveland and was favorably impressed with what was then a small but\r\nflourishing town. In 1837, he returned from his western journey and\r\nresumed business, but again his health failed, and he was ordered to\r\npermanently abandon Albany and seek a more favorable climate. Remembering\r\nthe advantages of Cleveland both for business and residence, he concluded\r\nto remove to that point.\r\n\r\nHere he continued his connection with the forwarding business by opening\r\nan agency for the American Transportation Line of canal boats on the Erie\r\ncanal, his office being at the foot of Superior street. In 1841, he\r\nengaged in the purchase and shipment of staves, the markets for which\r\nwere Albany and New York. This branch of business he continued for about\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, he built a steam elevator on River street, near his old stand, it\r\nbeing the first brick building erected on the river front. With the\r\ncompletion of this building he turned his attention more particularly to\r\ngrain, receiving it by canal from the interior. On the opening of the\r\nCleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati railroad, his elevator was easily\r\nconnected with that line, and the first load of railroad wheat stored in\r\nCleveland was received into his elevator.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1840, Mr. Scott became interested in the lake marine by\r\nthe purchase of the brig Amazon, of 220 tons, then considered a craft of\r\ngood size. At the time of the purchase, the West was flooded with wild-cat\r\nmoney, and specie was very scarce. The brig was sold by order of the\r\nChancellor of Michigan, and specie demanded from the purchaser, a\r\ncondition that made buyers shy. In 1842, Mr. Scott purchased the schooner\r\nJohn Grant, of 100 tons, and in the following three years added to his\r\nlittle fleet the schooner Panama, of 100 tons, and the brig Isabella, of\r\nover 300 tons, the latter being something highly respectable in the way of\r\nlake shipping.\r\n\r\nPrudence, foresight, and careful enterprise made all his ventures\r\nreasonably successful. In 1865, he resolved to quit business and enjoy the\r\ncompetence he had acquired, first in foreign travel, to free himself more\r\nthoroughly from business cares, and then in lettered ease at home. In\r\npursuance of this purpose he spent six months in Europe, returning with\r\nrecruited energies to the enjoyment of the well stocked library of rare\r\nvolumes collected during his years of active business, and largely added\r\nto during his foreign travels.\r\n\r\nA few facts in Mr. Scott's life, exhibiting his thorough confidence in the\r\nGovernment and the cause of the Union, should not be passed over. The\r\nfirst investment in the original War Loan taken in Cleveland, if not in\r\nOhio, was made by Mr. Scott, August 12th, 1861. He still retains and\r\nexhibits with justifiable pride, a certificate from the Acting Secretary\r\nof the Treasury, dated August 29th, 1861, stating that five thousand\r\ndollars had been received from him on account of the three years'\r\ntreasury notes, and promising that they should be sent him as soon as\r\nprepared. From that time to the present he has invested freely in\r\nGovernment securities, being fully convinced of their safety.\r\n\r\nSince his retirement from business and return from European travel, he has\r\nemployed his leisure in literary pursuits, especially in genealogical and\r\nhistorical studies, and has frequently contributed to the journals of the\r\nday curious and interesting facts relating to the early settlers in New\r\nEngland, in correction of erroneous beliefs regarding them.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Mr. Scott was married to Miss Mary Williamson, by whom he has had\r\nseven children, of whom three still live.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. P. Robison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the soldiers present at Braddock's defeat at Fort Duquesne, near\r\nPittsburgh, was John Decker Robison, an American of Scotch descent, who\r\nalso did good service during the Revolutionary war. When the war was over\r\nhe married a Hollander living on the North River, and when a young family\r\ngrew up about him, moved to western New York, where, building the first\r\nhouse in Canandaigua, he received a patent of six hundred acres of land and\r\nsettled down as a farmer in Vienna, N. Y. One of his family was a boy,\r\nPeter Robison, who stuck to the farm until the ex-Revolutionary soldier\r\nhad gone down to the tomb, and until he himself had reached several years\r\nbeyond the meridian of life, when he obeyed the general law of American\r\nhuman nature, and moved toward the setting sun. Years before this step was\r\ntaken he had married Miss Hetty H. Havens, of Lyons, N. Y., and raised a\r\nfamily of children, among them J. P. Robison, the subject of this sketch,\r\nwho was born in Ontario county, on the 23rd of January, 1811.\r\n\r\nLike his father, young Robison spent the earlier years of his life in\r\nworking on the farm, and it was not until his sixteenth year that it was\r\ndecided to give him a good education. He was then sent to Niffing's High\r\nSchool, at Vienna, N. Y., where he attained considerable proficiency in\r\nhis studies, including Latin and Mathematics. Having developed a taste for\r\nmedical studies he was admitted as a private pupil of Professer Woodward,\r\nof the Vermont College of Medicine, and graduated in November, 1831.\r\nImmediately on the completion of his studies he moved into Ohio and\r\ncommenced practice in Bedford, Cuyahoga county, in February, 1832. He soon\r\nsucceeded in building up a good practice, and for eleven years continued\r\nin the exercise of his profession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, J. P. Robison]\r\n\r\nThen Dr. Robison concluded to change his business. In company with W. B.\r\nHillman he engaged in mercantile business at Bedford, opening a store and\r\nat the same time carrying on other descriptions of trade, such as milling,\r\npacking provisions, dealing in land, and other operations such as the\r\nspeculative American is always ready to engage in. Among other things he\r\nstarted a chair factory and a tannery, and his active mind was always\r\nrevolving projects for the increase of business, and, of course, of\r\nbusiness profits.\r\n\r\nBut, whilst his hands were full of all kinds of business enterprises, Dr.\r\nRobison found abundant leisure for a different kind of occupation. He was\r\nan intimate friend and associate of Alexander Campbell, the leader of the\r\nDisciple movement, and organized a congregation of this faith in Bedford,\r\nwhich he preached to for sixteen years. When he commenced his ministerial\r\nlabors in Bedford, (from whom, at no time, did he receive fee or reward,)\r\nhis congregation numbered less than a dozen, but when he closed his term\r\nof service as a voluntary minister he left for his successor a\r\ncongregation numbering four hundred and forty, showing conclusively that\r\nhis ministering had not been in vain. Nor was his zeal for the faith as\r\nunderstood by the Disciples content with preaching during this long term\r\nof service. His purse was always ready for the calls of the church, and,\r\nin company with Alexander Campbell, he traveled from place to place\r\nthroughout a great part of Ohio, addressing the vast concourses called\r\ntogether by the fame of the Disciple leader, then in the plenitude of his\r\npower and influence as a preacher and teacher. In these gatherings and in\r\nsuch company Dr. Robison enriched his mind and developed a great talent\r\nfor extemporaneous address and discussion. Of a positive nature he brought\r\nstrong earnestness and unflagging energy to the work in which he was\r\nengaged, and carried his hearers with him, as he himself was frequently\r\nborne away by the enthusiasm of his subject. The same earnestness and\r\nenergy which made him so successful as a preacher served to make him\r\npopular and effective on the political platform, and in the cause of the\r\nsoldiers of the Union in recent years. During the war he was active in\r\nprocuring volunteers for the Union army, and whenever an effort was made\r\nto aid the cause of the Union Dr. Robison was among the foremost in the\r\nwork. In politics Dr. Robison was an old Clay Whig. After the demolition\r\nof that party he voted with the Democrats. In 1861, he was chosen to the\r\nState Senate by the union of the War Democrats and Republicans, receiving\r\nthe largest vote for any senator from this county. Since that time he has\r\nvoted with the Republican party. His Senatorial career was highly\r\nhonorable to himself and of value to his constituents, who found in him a\r\nfaithful, active and intelligent representative.\r\n\r\nIt is as a packer of provisions that Dr. Robison has been for many years\r\nchiefly known. For twenty-five years he had been associated with General\r\nO. M. Oviatt in the packing business at Cleveland, and the brand of the\r\nfirm had grown to be recognized everywhere as thoroughly reliable. In\r\n1865, this partnership was dissolved, and Dr. Robison continued the\r\nbusiness at first alone and afterwards in company with Archibald Baxter of\r\nNew York. The scarcity of fat cattle in this vicinity compelled him in\r\n1866 to remove his principal packing house to Chicago, where he continues\r\nto operate heavily, the amount paid out for cattle during the last season\r\nbeing over $300,000. In addition to the Chicago packing he has continued\r\nthe work in Cleveland, and also for several years did something in that\r\nline at Lafayette, Indiana. The firm's brand, \"The Buckeye\", is well known\r\nand highly esteemed both in the United States and England, to which\r\nprovisions bearing that mark are largely shipped.\r\n\r\nHad Dr. Robison continued his practice as a physician he would undoubtedly\r\nhave attained eminence in his profession, a leading physician having\r\nfrequently borne testimony to his extraordinary skill in diagnosing\r\ndisease, and urged him to devote his entire attention to his profession.\r\nBut he preferred curing beef and pork to curing human bodies, and, so far\r\nas financial results are concerned, probably made a wise choice, though\r\nthe judgment of human nature and insight into men's motives to which he\r\nattributes his success, would have served him in good stead in either\r\nline. At the age of fifty-eight, Dr. Robison is found in possession of a\r\nhandsome competency, although he has all through life dealt with marked\r\nliberality toward all worthy objects of charity and patriotism. He is\r\nstill in possession of much of the vigor that has characterized his\r\nbusiness career, and we trust his life of usefulness may yet be long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, T. P. Handy]\r\n\r\nTruman P. Handy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest banker in Cleveland, and probably the oldest active banker in\r\nthe State, is Truman P. Handy, now president of the Merchants National\r\nBank. He has been identified with the banking business of Cleveland from\r\nhis first arrival in the city, thirty-seven years ago, and throughout the\r\nwhole time has been a successful financier, managing the institutions\r\nunder his charge with unvarying skill and good fortune.\r\n\r\nMr. Handy was born in Paris, Oneida county, New York, January 17th, 1807.\r\nHe had the advantage of a good academical education, and made preparation\r\nfor entering college, which, however, he did not do, and at the close of\r\nhis school term, spent the remaining time, until his eighteenth year,\r\nupon his father's farm, with the exception of two winters in which he\r\ntaught school.\r\n\r\nOn reaching his eighteenth year it was decided that he should enter on a\r\ncommercial life, and a year or two were spent in stores in Utica and New\r\nHartford, N. Y., leaving the latter place in October, 1826, to take a\r\nposition in the Bank of Geneva, Ontario county, N. Y., of which the Kev. H.\r\nDwight was president. With this commenced Mr. Handy's long banking career.\r\nFive years were spent in this bank and then he accepted an invitation to\r\nremove to Buffalo, for the purpose of assisting in the organization of the\r\nBank of Buffalo, of which he was made teller, and remained one year in\r\nthat position. In March, 1832, the young banker married Miss Harriet N.\r\nHall, of Geneva, and with his bride set out on the wedding tour, which was\r\nalso one of business, to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances the journey would scarcely be deemed a pleasant\r\none. It was in early Spring, and the weather was still inclement. The\r\nroads were bad, and the lumbering stage floundered heavily through mud,\r\nand amid obstructions that made the way one of discomfort, not unmixed\r\nwith peril, for six weary days, between Geneva and Cleveland. But in\r\naddition to the fact that it was a bridal tour, the young couple were\r\ncheered by the prospect before them. The charter of the old Commercial\r\nBank of Lake Erie, established in 1816, and which had gone under, had been\r\npurchased by the Hon. George Bancroft and his family in Massachusetts, and\r\nit was designed to resuscitate it under better auspices. Mr. Handy had\r\nbeen invited to become the cashier, and in pursuance of his acceptance of\r\nthe invitation, was, with his bride, on his way to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe bank was organized on his arrival and commenced business on the lot\r\nnow occupied by the Merchants National Bank, at the corner of Superior\r\nand Bank streets, the bank lot running back to the present site of the\r\nHerald building. Leonard Case, the president of the old Bank of Lake\r\nErie, was president of the resuscitated bank, with T. P. Handy as cashier.\r\nIt did a thriving business until 1842, when the term of its charter\r\nexpired, and the Legislature refused to renew it, compelling the bank to\r\ngo into liquidation. When the great crash of 1837 occurred, the bank had\r\nbeen compelled to take real estate in settlement of the liabilities of\r\nits involved customers, and thus the corporation became one of the\r\ngreatest landholders of the city. Had the property been retained by the\r\nbank owners, it would by this time have been worth to them many millions\r\nof dollars.\r\n\r\nThe close of the bank and the winding up of its affairs necessitated the\r\ndisposal of the real estate for the purpose of dividing the assets among\r\nthe stockholders. Messrs. T. P. Handy, H. B. Payne, and Dudley Baldwin were\r\nappointed commissioners to close up the affairs of the bank and discharge\r\nits liabilities. This being done, the remaining cash and real estate were\r\ndivided among the stockholders, who appointed Mr. Handy their trustee to\r\ndispose of the property. This was accomplished in 1845, when Mr. Handy\r\nmade his final settlement. During the time subsequent to the close of the\r\nbank, he had been carrying on a private banking business under the name of\r\nT. P. Handy & Co.\r\n\r\nIn the Winter of 1845, the State Legislature passed a law authorizing the\r\nestablishment of the State Bank of Ohio, and of independent banks. In\r\nNovember of that year, Mr. Handy organized the Commercial Branch of the\r\nState Bank of Ohio, with a capital of one hundred and seventy-five\r\nthousand dollars, and took position in it as cashier, the president being\r\nWilliam A. Otis, and the directors, additional to Messrs. Otis and Handy,\r\nbeing John M. Woolsey, N. C. Winslow, and Jonathan Gillett. Mr. Handy was\r\nthe acting manager of the institution, and so successful was his conduct\r\nof its affairs that the stockholders received an average of nearly twenty\r\nper cent. on their investment through nearly the whole time until the\r\ntermination of its charter in 1865, a period of twenty years. His policy\r\nwas liberal, but with remarkable judgment he avoided hazardous risks, and\r\nwhilst the bank always had as much business as it could possibly\r\naccommodate, the tightest times never affected its credit.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Commercial Branch Bank was having such uninterrupted success,\r\nthe Merchants Branch of the State Bank of Ohio, on the same street, was\r\nexperiencing a run of bad fortune. The failure of the Ohio Life and Trust\r\nCompany embarrassed it for a time, and other causes conspired with this to\r\ncripple its resources. In 1861, the stockholders invited Mr. Handy to take\r\ncharge of its affairs as president, and he accepted the trust. His usual\r\nsuccess followed him to his new position, and the affairs of the bank were\r\nsuddenly and permanently improved.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1865, in common with most of the State banking institutions,\r\nthe Merchants Branch Bank stockholders decided to wind up the concern as a\r\nState institution, and avail themselves of the provisions of the National\r\nBanking Act. The Merchants National Bank was organized with an authorized\r\ncapital of one million of dollars, of which six hundred thousand dollars\r\nwas paid in, Mr. Handy assuming the presidency, and having associated\r\nwith him in the management, Messrs. T. M. Kelley, M. Barnett, William\r\nCollins, James F. Clark, Samuel L. Mather, and William Bingham. Under this\r\nmanagement the bank has thus far had an uninterrupted tide of prosperity,\r\nwith every prospect of its continuance.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone as a banker that Mr. Handy has made himself prominent\r\namong the citizens of Cleveland, He has been intimately connected with\r\nother enterprises tending to increase the prosperity of the city, and it\r\nis remarkable that all the undertakings he has been connected with have\r\nproved profitable, to himself to a greater or less extent, as might be\r\nexpected, but in a far greater degree to others, the stockholders, for\r\nwhose interests he was laboring. Few, if any, men in Cleveland have made\r\nmore money for others than has Mr. Handy.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his banking duties, he filled the position from 1850 to\r\n1860, of treasurer of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati railroad, and\r\nmanaged its finances with that skill and ability which were peculiarly\r\nneeded in the earlier portion of that period, when the road was an\r\nexperiment, carried on under the heaviest difficulties. In 1860, he\r\nresigned his position as treasurer, and is now a director in that company.\r\nHe has also been interested in other railroads centering in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, a Cleveland built schooner left the lakes for the ocean, and\r\ncrossed the Atlantic to Liverpool, thus commencing the direct trade\r\nbetween the lakes and European ports. In 1857, another Cleveland built\r\nvessel was sent across, loaded with staves and lumber, and returned with\r\ncrockery and iron. The success of these Tentures attracted the attention\r\nof the enterprising business men of the lakes, and in the Spring of 1858,\r\na fleet of ten vessels left Cleveland, all but one loaded with staves and\r\nlumber, for European ports. Their departure was marked by demonstrations\r\non the part of the authorities and leading men of business, and with a\r\nfair breeze and good wishes the fleet bore away for salt water. Of the ten\r\nvessels, three were sent by Mr. Handy, the R. H. Harmon, bound for\r\nLiverpool, the D. B. Sexton, for London, and the J. F. Warner, for Glasgow.\r\nAll of the vessels made quick and profitable trips, and the trade thus\r\nbegun has been carried on with profit to the present time, although at the\r\nbreaking out of the war American vessels were compelled to withdraw from\r\nit, leaving the enterprise wholly in the hands of English parties, who\r\npurchased vessels for the trade.\r\n\r\nWhilst his vessels were in Europe, Mr. Handy availed himself of the\r\nopportunity to visit Great Britain and the Continent, to attend to his\r\ninterests, and at the same time to study some of the institutions of the\r\nold world, especially the financial, religious and educational. In\r\neducational matters he had always taken a deep interest, having watched\r\nwith a careful eye the growth of the public schools of Cleveland, and for\r\nsome time was associated with Mr. Charles Bradburn in their management, as\r\nmembers of the Board of Education. And this, which was wholly a labor of\r\nlove, with no remuneration but the consciousness of having done some good\r\nby hard work, was the only public office ever held by Mr. Handy, or ever\r\ndesired by him. At the same time he was deeply interested in the growth\r\nand management of the Sunday schools of the city, and for many years has\r\ntaken a leading part in all movements calculated to extend their field of\r\nusefulness and increase their efficiency. In Great Britain he visited the\r\nSunday schools and was warmly welcomed by teachers and scholars, who were\r\ngreatly interested in his account of the working of Sunday schools here,\r\nwhilst the narration of his experiences on that side of the Atlantic\r\nfrequently delighted the scholars at home on his return.\r\n\r\nAlthough rapidly approaching the period allotted by the psalmist to man as\r\nhis term of life, Mr. Handy is still as full of vigor and business energy\r\nas much younger men, and is as earnest as of old in managing large\r\nfinancial undertakings, or in teaching his class in Sunday school. His\r\nheart is as young at sixty-two, as at twenty-seven, and the secret of his\r\ncontinued health and vigor undoubtedly lies in his temperate and upright\r\nlife, his kindly disposition, and that simple cheerfulness of spirit that\r\nmakes him thoroughly at home in the society of children, who, in their\r\nturn, are thoroughly at home with him. One of the most energetic and\r\nsuccessful of business men, he has never allowed business to so engross\r\nhis time and attention as to leave no opportunity for religions or social\r\nduties or enjoyments. In this way he has won the confidence and esteem of\r\nall classes of citizens as a successful financier, a good citizen, a man\r\nof the strictest probity, a warm friend, and a genial acquaintance.\r\n\r\nMr. Handy has but one child living, a daughter, now the wife of Mr. John\r\nS. Newberry, of Detroit. His only other child, a boy, died in infancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: C. Bradburn]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Bradburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Charles Bradburn is a merchant long and honorably known in the\r\ncommercial history of Cleveland, and that he still retains a prominent\r\nplace in the business circles which he entered thirty-three years ago, are\r\nundeniable facts. And yet, the great feature of Mr. Bradburn's busy life,\r\nand that of which he is justly most proud, is not his business successes,\r\nbut his connection with the public schools of this city. His money, made\r\nby anxious care in his warehouse and among business men, was freely spent\r\nto promote the cause of education, and the labor, solicitude and anxiety\r\nwith which he prosecuted his business, great as they necessarily were,\r\nmust be counted small compared with his sacrifices of time and labor in\r\nthe effort to extend and improve the school system and make the school\r\nhouses of the city a source of gratulation and pride to the citizens. But\r\nwhilst his hardest labor was in the service of the schools, it was purely\r\na labor of love, whilst his work on the river was a labor of business, and\r\ntherefore he must, in this record of Cleveland's noted men, take rank\r\namong his commercial brethren.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradburn was born at Attleborough, Massachusetts, July 16th, 1808. His\r\nfather was a cotton manufacturer when that great industrial interest was\r\nin its infancy. The first manufacture in this country of several articles\r\nof twilled fabrics was in his factory.\r\n\r\nAt the age of seven years Charles Bradburn had the misfortune to lose his\r\nmother, a lady highly esteemed by all who knew her. This loss was a\r\nserious one, as it left him almost entirely to his own resources. When\r\nsixteen years old he entered the Lowell machine shop as an apprentice, and\r\nafter a service of three years, graduated with a diploma from the\r\nMiddlesex Mechanics Association. He served as a journeyman for two years,\r\nwhen, feeling that his education was not adequate to his wants, he left\r\nthe mechanic's bench for the student's desk, entering the classical school\r\nof Professor Coffin at Ashfield, in the western part of the same State.\r\nSubsequently he resumed his mechanical labors, which he continued until\r\n1833, part of the time as a journeyman, but during the greater part as a\r\nmanufacturer on his own account. At that date he changed his business from\r\nmanufacturing to commerce, opening a store in Lowell.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, he decided to remove to the West, and in that year brought his\r\nfamily to Cleveland, where he commenced the wholesale and retail grocery\r\nbusiness in the wooden building now standing, adjoining the old City\r\nBuildings, which were not then finished. The next year he rented the two\r\nstores adjoining in the then new City Buildings, of which but a portion\r\nnow remains. In 1840, he built the warehouse now standing at the foot of\r\nSt. Clair street and moved his business to that place, abandoning the\r\nretail branch. At the same time he established a distillery on what was\r\nthen known as \"the island,\" on the west side of the river. In 1854, he\r\nremoved to the spacious warehouses, 58 and 60 River street, now occupied\r\nby him and his partners under the same name, \"C. Bradburn & Co.,\" that\r\ngraced the walls of the City Buildings in 1836. During his long\r\ncommercial life Mr. Bradburn has enjoyed largly theturnpikesnce and esteem\r\nof the commercial community and is now one of the most energetic business\r\nmen of the city.\r\n\r\nBut it is in his devotion to the cause of knowledge and popular education\r\nthat Mr. Bradburn appears especially as a representative man. He was one\r\nof the first officers of the Mercantile Library Association, and in its\r\nearly history took much interest in its prosperity. His great work,\r\nhowever, lay in the schools. In a letter to a friend recently written, he,\r\nwith characteristic modesty, writes: \"After a life almost as long as is\r\nallotted to man, the only thing I find to glory in is having been able to\r\nrender some service to the cause of popular education; to be called by so\r\nmany of our ablest educators the father of our public schools, was glory\r\nenough, and ample compensation for many years of hard labor and the\r\nexpenditure of much money in the cause.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Bradburn was in 1839 elected to the City Council from the Third ward.\r\nAs chairman of the Committee on Fire and Water he reorganized the Fire\r\nDepartment, which was then in a wretched condition, and, with the\r\nassistance of Mr. J. L. Weatherly, who was made Chief Engineer, and the\r\naid of new laws, made it one of the most efficient of any at that time\r\nexisting in the country. As chairman of the Committee on Streets, at that\r\ntime an office of much responsibility and labor, he rendered the city\r\nvaluable service.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, he was elected a member and made chairman of the Board of School\r\nManagers. This body was merged into the Board of Education, and for\r\nseveral years he filled the office of president. For thirteen consecutive\r\nyears he served as member of the Board of School Managers and of the Board\r\nof Education, during much of which time he had almost unaided control of\r\nthe educational affairs of the city. Mr. Bradburn succeeded in getting\r\nthrough the Legislature a bill authorizing the establishment of a High\r\nSchool, the first institution of the kind, connected with the public\r\nschools, in the State of Ohio. A school of this character was started in\r\nJune, 1846, and maintained in spite of fierce opposition. But there was no\r\nbuilding to receive it, and its earlier years were spent in the basement\r\nof a church on Prospect street, the room being fitted up by Mr. Bradburn\r\nand rented by the city for fifty dollars per annum.\r\n\r\nFeeling strongly that he could render better service to the cause of\r\npopular education in the City Council than he could in the Board of\r\nEducation, in 1853 he resigned his seat in the latter body and was elected\r\nto the City Council. When Ohio City was united with Cleveland, he was\r\nchosen president of the united Councils.\r\n\r\nHaving, on taking his seat in the Council, been appointed to a position on\r\nthe Committee on Schools, his first and continuous efforts were directed\r\nto bringing the Council to provide suitable buildings, not only for the\r\nHigh School, but for all the schools of the city. In consequence of his\r\nearnest and persistent labors an ordinance was passed authorizing a loan\r\nfor school purposes of $30,000. The loan was negotiated at par without\r\nexpense to the city. Mr. Bradburn, and the Building Committee, of which he\r\nwas chairman, immediately made plans for the Central High School, and the\r\nMayflower, Eagle and Alabama street Grammar schools, all of which were put\r\nunder contract without delay, and finished under their supervision to the\r\nentire satisfaction of the Council and Board of Education. The teachers\r\nof the public schools in gratitude for his services in the cause of\r\neducation, induced Mr. Bradburn to sit to Allen Smith, Jr., for his\r\npicture, which was then hung in the hall of the Central High School. At a\r\nsubsequent date the High School teachers presented him with a massive\r\ngold-headed cane, engraved with a complimentary inscription, but this\r\nhighly prized token was unfortunately lost, together with a number of\r\nother cherished mementoes and all the family pictures, in a fire which\r\ndestroyed his residence in February, 1868. In the fire also perished a\r\nvaluable library of over four hundred volumes, the result of a lifetime's\r\ncollection, and Mr. Bradburn barely escaped with his own life from a third\r\nstory window, being badly injured in the descent.\r\n\r\nIn public matters he has done but little during the past few years,\r\ndevoting himself entirely to his business, but he may be seen on all\r\noccasions where the cause of popular education can be benefited by his\r\npresence. In 1848, he was the Whig candidate for Mayor, but, being ill at\r\nthe time, gave the canvass no personal attention, and was defeated by a\r\nfew votes, the opponents of the High School, of whatever party, voting\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Bradburn the credit belongs of procuring, after a hard battle\r\nagainst parsimony and prejudice, the establishment of the first free High\r\nSchool in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Raymond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Raymond was born in Bethlem, Connecticut, March 19, 1805. Like most\r\nof the sons of New England, his boyhood was passed in plowing among the\r\nrocks on one of the stony farms of that rocky and hilly State. At the age\r\nof sixteen he commenced teaching the village school, and continued\r\nteaching for six years, a portion of that time being spent in New York\r\nState, in one of the many pretty towns that are scattered along on either\r\nside of the Hudson. Returning to Connecticut at the end of his six years'\r\ntrial of teaching, he was employed to keep the books of the old and\r\nwealthy firm of Messrs. A. & C. Day, dry goods commission merchants, at\r\nHartford. The late Governor Morgan, of New York, was, at the same time, a\r\nsalesman in the house.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, Mr. Raymond married Mary North, daughter of James North, of New\r\nBritain, Conn.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1835, he determined to try his fortune in the Far West,\r\naway out in Ohio. With Kansas as the present geographical centre of the\r\nUnion, it is difficult for us to conceive of the New Englanders' idea of\r\nthe West at that time. It was something of an undertaking. It was a\r\njourney of weeks, not a ride of twenty-three hours in a sleeping coach or\r\npalace car. It meant long and tedious days of staging--a monotonous ride\r\nalong the Erie canal from Schenectady to some point a little farther west,\r\nand finally, when the lake was not frozen over, the perils of lake\r\nnavigation. In 1835, Cleveland, Erie and Sandusky were all struggling for\r\nsupremacy. When Mr. Raymond got as far west as Erie, he thought that might\r\nbe a good place for him \"to drive a stake,\" but the number of newly made\r\ngraves suggested to him, on second thought, the propriety of getting out\r\nof the place as speedily as possible. Cleveland at that time was beginning\r\nto put on city airs--Kellogg's great hotel (the American) was slowly going\r\nup. The only vacant store to be had by Mr. R. was a little wooden building\r\non the site of the present Rouse block--a location at that time about as\r\nfar out of town as it would be safe for a prudent merchant to venture.\r\nHenry W. and Marvin Clark were associated with him in business, under the\r\nfirm name of Raymond & Clark.\r\n\r\nMr. Raymond was a merchant of more than ordinary business ability, a man\r\nof scrupulous exactness in his business dealings. His extreme conservatism\r\nin business management carried him safely through every commercial crisis.\r\n\r\nLike most business men Mr. Raymond had but little time to devote to\r\npolitical discussions. He voted the Whig ticket as long as the old Whig\r\nparty had an existence. In religions principles he was a Presbyterian, and\r\nunited with the First Presbyterian Church in 1840, at that time under the\r\npastoral charge of Rev. Dr. S. C. Aiken.\r\n\r\nIn the Winter of 1866, in compliance with his physician's advice, he took\r\na journey south for the benefit of his health, which had been impaired by\r\nhis unremitting devotion to business. In company with a party of friends\r\nfrom Cincinnati, he and his wife left Louisville for Havana, in January.\r\nOn the 2d of February a telegram was received by the remaining members of\r\nhis family in Cleveland, informing them that Mr. Raymond was among the\r\nmissing on the ill-fated steamer Carter, which was burned when within a\r\nfew miles of Vicksburg.\r\n\r\nWhen the alarm was given, Mr. Raymond and his wife were asleep. Hastily\r\ndressing themselves and providing themselves with life-preservers, they\r\njumped through the cabin window, Mr. Raymond having a state-room door\r\nwhich he had wrenched from its hinges. Mrs. Raymond clung to a floating\r\nbale of hay and was saved after an hour of peril and suffering in the icy\r\nwater. Nothing was seen of Mr. Raymond after he floated away from the\r\nwreck, clinging to the door. His death was mourned by a large circle of\r\nfriends who appreciated his worth.\r\n\r\nBy diligence and economy he accumulated a valuable estate, leaving to his\r\nfamily property valued at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard T. Lyon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first secretary of the Cleveland Board of Trade, and its president for\r\nthe year 1869, Richard T. Lyon, is probably the oldest established\r\nmerchant now doing business on the river. He arrived here in 1823, when\r\nthere were but a few hundred people in the village, and for some time\r\nresided with his father-in-law, Noble H. Merwin, on the lot now occupied\r\nby Bishop's Block, about where M. Heisel's confectionary store now stands.\r\nIn 1838, he entered as clerk in the forwarding house of Griffith, Standart\r\n& Co., at the foot of Superior street, continuing in that position until\r\nthe Spring of 1841, when he formed a partnership with I. L. Hewitt, and\r\ncarried on a forwarding and commission business on River street, under the\r\nfirm name of Hewitt & Lyon. The partnership continued until 1847, when Mr.\r\nHewitt retired, and Mr. Lyon continued the business in his own name at 67\r\nMerwin street, where he has remained until the present time. In the Spring\r\nof 1868, his son, R. S. Lyon, was taken into partnership, the firm name\r\nbeing changed to R. T. Lyon & Son. For a number of years Mr. Lyon has been\r\nthe largest dealer of salt in the city, having had the agency of the salt\r\nworks in western New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyon has held, from his first entry into commercial life to the\r\npresent time, the esteem and confidence of the business men of Cleveland,\r\nand that confidence has been shown by the fact, that for many years he was\r\nthe treasurer of the Board of Trade, having been elected to that position\r\non the organisation of the Board; was subsequently made vice-president,\r\nand in the Spring of 1869, was elected president. This compliment was well\r\nmerited, for he is now one of the very few remaining members of the Board\r\nwho took part in its organization, and has never flagged in his interest\r\nin its affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, H. M. Chapin]\r\n\r\n\r\nH. M. Chapin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the commercial, political, patriotic, and literary history of Cleveland\r\nfor the past fifteen or twenty years, the name of H. M. Chapin will always\r\nhave honorable prominence. In all these departments his persistent energy\r\nand unshaken faith, even in the darkest hours, have been potent for good.\r\n\r\nMr. Chapin was born in Walpole, N. H., July 29th, 1823, and received a good\r\ncommon school education. When fifteen years old, he removed to Boston, and\r\nentered a dry goods importing house, in which he remained nearly ten\r\nyears. In the Spring of 1848, he left Boston for Cleveland, where he\r\nbecame a partner in the wholesale grocery warehouse of Charles Bradburn &\r\nCo., with whom he remained four years. In 1852, he commenced business as a\r\nprovision dealer and packer of pork and beef. For a time it was up-hill\r\nwork, but his native perseverance overcame all difficulties, and in the\r\nseason of 1862-3, his business had grown to seven hundred and fifty\r\nthousand dollars. From that time there was a steady decline in the amount\r\nof packing done in Cleveland, the supply of cattle and hogs decreasing\r\nuntil but a very small quantity, in proportion to the facilities for\r\npacking, could be depended on. The slaughter-houses of Chicago arrested\r\nthe great stream of live stock, and what escaped them went forward to the\r\nAtlantic cities for immediate consumption. In the Winter of 1867-8, Mr.\r\nChapin, therefore, resolved to remove his packing business to Chicago, and\r\ncommenced operations there with gratifying success. He intended abandoning\r\nCleveland altogether as a packing point, but, contrary to his\r\nexpectations, he has been able to resume the business here to a moderate\r\nextent. From 1862 to 1867, he carried on, in connection with the packing\r\nbusiness, a very extensive coopering establishment, employing about fifty\r\nmen, besides a large amount of machinery. Over a hundred and twenty-five\r\nmen were at the same time employed in slaughtering and packing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his ordinary business, and partly in connection with it,\r\nMr. Chapin turned his attention to the question of insurance. It was a\r\nfavorite maxim with him that the West was able to do its own insurance,\r\nand with this idea ever present, he was favorable to the establishment of\r\nhome insurance companies. Of the Sun Fire Insurance Company, of\r\nCleveland, he was for some years the vice-president, and labored earnestly\r\nfor its success. Being a thorough believer in the principles of\r\nHomoeopathy, as well as an enthusiast on the subject of western insurance,\r\nhe was a willing co-worker with a number of prominent citizens engaged in\r\nthe organization of the Hahnemann Life Insurance Company, of Cleveland.\r\nThe novel character of this company--it being the first of the kind in the\r\nUnited States--is sufficient warrant for a brief statement of its history.\r\nIt was established in 1865, and numbered among its stockholders such\r\nleading business men and substantial capitalists as Wm. A. Otis, George\r\nWorthington, William Bingham, Stillman Witt, Selah Chamberlain, Dudley\r\nBaldwin, D. P. Eells, M. G. Younglove, and the Hon. B. F. Wade. The\r\nleading feature was the offer to insure those whose medical belief and\r\npractice were exclusively Homoeopathic, at lower rates than those\r\nsubjecting themselves to Allopathic treatment. The theory on which this\r\noffer is based is, that all the evidence goes to show a lower rate of\r\nmortality under Homoeopathic than under Allopathic treatment. The\r\nHonorable William Baines, Insurance Commissioner of New York, in speaking\r\nof this company in his report, says: \"The Hahnemann Life Insurance\r\nCompany, of Cleveland, Ohio, is the first western company admitted into\r\nthis State. It starts with a paid up capital of $200,000, one-half of\r\nwhich is deposited with the State Treasurer of Ohio, for the protection of\r\npolicy holders. The company is organized on a basis of strength and\r\ncapital, even larger than that required of New York corporations; it\r\nreduces the rate of premium to Homoeopathic members.\"\r\n\r\nOf this company Mr. Chapin was made president, and in the management of\r\nthis, as in everything which he undertakes, he infused a large amount of\r\nhis energy, and made the company a complete success. During the present\r\nyear his almost undivided attention has been given to the company's\r\naffairs, with marked effect on its rapidly increasing business.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, Mr. Chapin was elected Mayor of the city of Cleveland. The honor\r\nwas not only unsought, but he was in entire ignorance of the whole affair\r\nuntil after his election. His name had not been mentioned in connection\r\nwith that or any other office when he left the city on a business trip\r\nthat kept him absent for several days. In the meantime the nominating\r\nconvention of the Union Republican party was held, and there was some\r\ndifficulty as to a choice between the persons named for the nomination as\r\nMayor. In casting around for a way out of the difficulty, the name of Mr.\r\nChapin was mentioned and instantly met with favor. He was nominated,\r\nelected by a strong majority, and the first intimation he received of the\r\nmovement was reading the election returns in the Cleveland Herald, on his\r\nhomeward journey.\r\n\r\nHe accepted the office in the spirit in which it had been conferred upon\r\nhim. He understood that the people believed he was disposed and able to\r\nmanage the affairs of the city vigorously and honestly, and he was not\r\ndisposed to evade the responsibilities of the office. His time was devoted\r\nto the duties of his position, the different departments under his charge\r\nwere carefully scrutinized, and whilst his strictness and vigorous\r\nexecution of the laws made the offenders complain of his severity, there\r\nwas no question raised as to his ability, integrity, or honest zeal for\r\nthe city's interest. He discharged the duties of his office with\r\nscrupulous exactness, and he endeavored to make others do the same. During\r\nhis administration it was no longer a reproach that the ordinances of the\r\ncity stood\r\n\r\n  \"Like the forfeits in a barbers shop,\r\n  As much in mock as mark.\"\r\n\r\nAt the breaking out of the war, Mr. Chapin took an early and active part\r\nin stirring up the people to defend the Government of the Union. Wherever\r\nhis money, influence, or active energy could be made serviceable, there he\r\nwas always to be found. Having obtained the appropriation for the\r\nTwenty-Ninth Regiment, he worked diligently in raising, equipping, and\r\nsending it to the field, and spent much of his own time at the front in\r\nvarious capacities. The ladies who worked diligently for the comfort of\r\nthe soldiers and the care of the sick and wounded, through the medium of\r\nthe Ladies' Aid Association, found in Mr. Chapin an indefatigable\r\nassistant. He was ever ready with suggestion, active aid, and money,\r\nlaboring day and night, either at the front, in the hospitals, or at\r\nhome, in behalf of the soldier.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland Library Association was another field in which Mr. Chapin's\r\nenergy and business tact were manifested. In 1854, he was elected\r\npresident of the Association, which had struggled along, a feeble\r\norganization, contending against numerous difficulties. Under his vigorous\r\nmanagement the Association was brought to a higher degree of prosperity\r\nthen it had ever witnessed; the income was largely increased, the number\r\nof books increased one-half, and a lively interest excited in the public\r\nmind concerning it. Mr. Chapin retired at the close of his term of office,\r\nand the affairs of the Association gradually lapsed into their former\r\nunsatisfactory condition. In 1858, an attempt was made to save it by\r\nrevolutionizing its constitution and management. A new constitution was\r\nadopted, and under it Mr. Chapin was again elected president. The result\r\nwas even more marked than in the previous instance. The number of members\r\nwas nearly doubled, a load of debt that had accumulated through a number\r\nof years was removed, a large number of books added to the library, and\r\nthe reading-room enlarged and improved. Again, after the lapse of ten\r\nyears, Mr. Chapin has been called to the presidency of the Association,\r\nunder circumstances precisely similar to those under which he had twice\r\nbefore assumed the duties of the position.\r\n\r\nMr. Chapin was married October 15th, 1849, to Matilda, daughter of John\r\nFenno, of Boston. Of this marriage have been born six children, the oldest\r\nof whom, a son now nineteen years of age, is in the wholesale grocery of\r\nEdwards, Townsend & Co.; the others are all attending school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses White.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses White, now one of the very few remaining early citizens of\r\nCleveland, was born at Warwick, Hampshire county, Mass., February\r\n25th, 1791. His father's name was Jacob White, a native of Menden,\r\nMass., who traces back his ancestors as natives of that town, to as\r\nearly a date as 1665.\r\n\r\nMoses White, the subject of this memoir, being deprived, at a very early\r\nage, of his mother, by death, went to live in Mendon, with his maternal\r\ngrandfather, Peter Penninian. Afterwards he went to Boston, where he\r\nlearned the merchant tailor business, with one John Willson. From Boston\r\nhe went to Providence, R. I., where he remained about two years, and where\r\nhe became acquainted with Miss Mary Andrews, whom he afterwards married.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, being desirons of settling further west, he first went to Utica,\r\nN. Y., and after remaining there a few months, he proceeded, with a horse\r\nand buggy, to Cleveland, where he arrived in October, 1816, the population\r\nof the place then being only about 150.\r\n\r\nHe established himself here as a merchant tailor, and pursued the business\r\nsteadily about twenty years, and with success. He afterwards established a\r\nstore at Chillicothe, Ohio, which, not being under his own care, did not\r\nprove successful.\r\n\r\nFrom his arrival in Cleveland, he was forward in all the moral and\r\nreligious enterprises of the place, first in union with all the religious\r\ndenominations represented, and afterwards he was more particularly\r\nidentified with the Baptist Church, in which he has been for nearly forty\r\nyears a deacon.\r\n\r\nHe now enjoys more than usual health and vigor for one of his age, and has\r\nthe respect, confidence and esteem of every person who knows him.\r\n\r\nHis wife having died in 1858, he has since that date made it his home with\r\nhis daughter, Mrs. J. P. Bishop, of Cleveland, with whom he now resides.\r\n\r\nIn many respects Deacon White's history furnishes an example worthy of\r\nimitation. In the times of his boyhood, in New England, when a boy did not\r\npossess the means for establishing himself in business, or of educating\r\nhimself for some professional calling, and particularly if he was an\r\norphan, he was required to learn some trade. In his case, his friends not\r\nonly recommended this, but he was desirous himself, of doing it. He\r\naccordingly went from Mendon to Boston, a distance of about forty miles,\r\nwhere, alone and among strangers, he sought a place where he might serve\r\nas an apprentice. For days he wandered about seeking such an opportunity\r\nand finally fell in with John Willson, the merchant tailor before\r\nmentioned, who received him as an errand boy, and finally as an\r\napprentice, in which position he continued, passing through all the grades\r\nincident to such employment, till he was twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nWithout father or mother, or friends to look up to for counsel and advice,\r\nhe persevered, and preserved his integrity, having the confidence of all\r\nwith whom he was associated.\r\n\r\nIn those early days, nothing was more common than to emigrate to the\r\nWest, leaving the principles of New England education, in religion and\r\nmorality, behind. Judging from accounts of society in Cleveland in very\r\nearly times, such must have been the case of some, at least.\r\n\r\nBut such was not the case with the youthful Moses White. Though he found\r\nnot many congenial spirits in this far-off western region, yet whenever,\r\nin the little village of Cleveland, he heard of a place of prayer, or a\r\nmeeting, or association for the promotion of temperance or morality,\r\nthither he bent his footsteps. Now in a ripe and happy old age he enjoys,\r\nnot only the retrospect, but also the present--and not only these, but he\r\nis constantly looking for a consummation of perfect happiness, beyond what\r\neither the past has, or the present life can afford.\r\n\r\nFinally, so far as accumulating wealth is concerned, he has not been as\r\nfortunate as some, and yet less unfortunate than many others, and now\r\nenjoys a competence abundantly sufficient to provide for all his wants and\r\nto transmit something to his children. Well may worldly ones say, \"O that\r\nmy last days might be like his!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid H. Beardsley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Beardsley does not claim to be a pioneer, but an early settler of the\r\nsecond class, having arrived in Cleveland with his family in June, 1826.\r\nCleveland is supposed to have then had about five hundred people. He was\r\nof Quaker origin, and lived at New Preston, Connecticut, before he removed\r\nto Ohio. He was of course anxious to obtain employment, and being a\r\nbeautiful penman, a contract was soon made with the late Judge Willey, who\r\nwas the county auditor, to serve as his clerk, at one dollar per day. He\r\nwas employed about thirty days in making the county duplicate. The taxable\r\nproperty of the county at that time amounted to the sum of two hundred and\r\nsixty-eight thousand, seven hundred and seventy-one dollars. When Mr.\r\nBeardsley was deputy auditor, all the public business centered in the old\r\nlog court house, on the northwest quarter of the Square.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth of July, 1827, the Ohio canal was opened to lock seventeen,\r\nnear Akron, and the canal commissioners, prominent among whom was his\r\nfriend Alfred Kelley, were in need of a scrupulously honest man, and a\r\ngood clerk, for the purpose of collecting tolls. They found all the\r\nnecessary qualifications of integrity, assiduity, and accuracy in Mr.\r\nBeardsley, who was therefore appointed, the day not having arrived when\r\nqualification for office should be the last of recommendations. The\r\ncollectorship may be said to have been Mr. Beardsley's profession. He\r\nspent in the office most of the period of active life, in twenty-three\r\nyears, undisturbed by the changes of administration. To our ears this may\r\nsound incredible.\r\n\r\nMr. Beardsley's salary was at first three hundred dollars per annum,\r\nincreasing to twelve hundred before the close of his services. He\r\ncollected the sum of one million, three hundred and ninety-eight thousand,\r\nsix hundred and forty-two dollars and sixty-eight cents. His accounts were\r\nmodels of nicety as well as accuracy, errors and discrepancies being\r\nequally unknown.\r\n\r\nBeing a gentleman of simple tastes and habits, with few wants, he has\r\nacquired a comfortable competence, without acquiring a thirst for gold,\r\nand without withholding his substance from charitable and public purposes.\r\nHe is highly esteemed by all who know him, for a life-long consistency of\r\ncharacter, and sterling qualities as a man and a friend. The writer\r\noccasionally sees him on our crowded streets, although quite feeble, with\r\na mind perfectly serene, and well aware that his race is almost run. His\r\nrecord is worthy of emulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Augustus Walton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the genial countenance and kindly voice of T. A. Walton were missed\r\nfrom the customary gatherings of the river merchants, it was felt that\r\nsomething had been lost which not even a lucky speculation, or a good run\r\nof trade, could not restore. When the news of his sudden death, whilst on\r\na foreign tour for the restoration of his health, was received, there was\r\ngenuine sorrow among his old business associates, and poignant grief with\r\nmany who had learned to look on him not merely as a successful merchant,\r\nbut as a man of tender heart and open hand when suffering and distress\r\nappealed to him for sympathy and aid.\r\n\r\nMr. Walton was born in London, and to the last he looked with affection to\r\nthe city of his birth. His education was gained at the City of London\r\nSchool. After leaving school he was brought up to mercantile pursuits, and\r\nin 1830, concluding that there was a better opening in that line in\r\nAmerica, he came to this country, bringing with him a considerable amount\r\nof money. For a few years he remained in New York, loaning his capital,\r\nfor which he always found ready customers, but unfortunately they were not\r\nall as ready to pay as to borrow. He lost large sums, and was driven to\r\nthe conclusion that for a man of his openness of character and confiding\r\nhonesty, New York was an unprofitable location. The representations of a\r\nfriend, combined with dissatisfaction with his experience in the\r\ncommercial metropolis, determined him to seek his fortune in the West.\r\nEvansburg, Ohio, had been represented to him as a desirable place in which\r\nto live, a thriving business point, and adjacent to good hunting ground.\r\nThis combination of attractions determined him, and he set out for\r\nEvansburg with what remained of his capital.\r\n\r\nBut the attractions of Evansburg soon wearied him. Neither his social,\r\ncommercial, nor sportsmanlike hopes were fulfilled by the facts, and Mr.\r\nWalton speedily turned his back on the place of so much promise and so\r\nlittle realization. Cleveland was the rising place of the West, and to\r\nCleveland he came, and established himself, as was the custom with new\r\ncomers of a commercial turn, in the produce and commission trade.\r\nFollowing the old maxim, he stuck to his business and his business stuck\r\nto him. The old frame warehouse in front of which he hung out his sign in\r\n1838, was occupied by him for twenty-five years, until January, 1863,\r\nwhen he retired from active business and was succeeded in the same\r\nbuilding by his nephew, Thomas Walton, who still retains the business and\r\nthe old location.\r\n\r\nMr. Walton's nice sense of honor commended him to a large circle of\r\ncustomers in the interior and in Michigan, whilst nearly all the Canadian\r\nbusiness with Cleveland passed through his hands. His Canadian customers\r\nrelied implicitly on his word, and the fact that he always retained his\r\nold friends, and received constant accessions of new, sufficiently proved\r\nthat their confidence was not misplaced.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1863, soon after his retirement from business, he went to\r\nEngland with the intention of staying a year or two and then returning to\r\nenjoy the remainder of his life in ease in this country. Whilst in\r\nEngland he paid a visit to some friends in Southampton, and whilst taking\r\na bath in a movable bathing-house on the beach, probably was seized with\r\ncramp and suffocated by water getting into his lungs. The news of his\r\ndeath caused a painful shock in business, social, and religious circles,\r\nwhere he had been so well known and so highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nFor a long term of years Mr. Walton was the presiding officer of the St.\r\nGeorge's Society of Cleveland, and that benevolent institution owed its\r\nusefulness in great measure to his indefatigable zeal in the cause, and to\r\nhis unstinted liberality. To the distressed of any nation he never turned\r\na deaf ear, but to the needy and suffering of his native country he was\r\never liberal, and accompanied his unostentatious charities with kind words\r\nand manifestations of sincere interest that were frequently as beneficial\r\nto the recipient as the money itself. He was also a valued member of the\r\nMasonic Order.\r\n\r\nIn religious belief he was an Episcopalian, and was long one of the\r\nleading members of Trinity Church. His devotion was unaffectedly sincere,\r\nand though he made no vaunt of his religious principles or hopes, there\r\ncould be no question of his deep, earnest convictions. Kind, courteous,\r\never thinking of the good of others, and wholly unselfish, Mr. Walton was\r\na good specimen of the true Christian gentleman.\r\n\r\nAlthough of English birth, and clinging affectionately to all that\r\nreminded him of his native land, he was a thorough supporter of American\r\ninstitutions, and an admirer of the American character. Deeply and warmly\r\nas he loved the land of his birth, his affection was even stronger for the\r\nland of his adoption, and it was his purpose to have returned from his\r\nvisit to his boyhood's home and settle down in peaceful content in the\r\nchosen home of his manhood, until death should lay him in an American\r\ngrave. When the war broke out he was an earnest and unshrinking supporter\r\nof the Government, and his means were freely used for its support, and for\r\nthe comfort of the soldiers who were fighting its battles. Though alien\r\nborn, and associated intimately with people of like birth, there was no\r\nnative American that could surpass him in love for the Union, and few that\r\nexceeded him, in proportion to his means, in contributions to the defence\r\nof the Union.\r\n\r\nIn the language of his favorite Shakespeare, it might be said of him\r\n\r\n  His life was gentle, and the elements\r\n  So mixed in him, that nature might stand up\r\n  And say to all the world, _This was a man_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Worthington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProminent among the business firms of Cleveland, is that of George\r\nWorthington & Co., a house which stands in the front rank both on account\r\nof the business done, and of its integrity and honorable dealing.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington, the founder and head of the firm, was born in\r\nCooperstown, N. Y., September 21st, 1813. He received a good common school\r\neducation, and then entered on a business career by becoming clerk in a\r\nhardware store in Utica, in 1830, remaining in that position until 1834,\r\nwhen he came to Cleveland and commenced business as a hardware dealer on\r\nhis own account. His first store was on the corner of Superior and Union\r\nlane, on the site of the clothing store of Isaac A. Isaacs, and the first\r\ngoods received by him were drawn by oxen owned by a man who did all the\r\ncarting at that time. Cleveland was then but a small town, and most of the\r\ntrading was done with the teamsters that came from Wooster and other\r\npoints south, bringing pork, grain, and other products, and taking back\r\nmerchandise. Trade was brisk, but cash scarce, nearly all the operations\r\nbeing more in the nature of barter than of purchase and sale.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining three years in his first store, he removed to the corner\r\nof Water and Superior streets, on the site of the present National Bank\r\nbuilding, and in that location he remained thirty years, during which time\r\nhe witnessed the growth of Cleveland from a small town to a large and\r\nprosperous city.\r\n\r\nWhen he had been established about fifteen years, Mr. Worthington began\r\nrapidly to enlarge his business, and he associated with him Mr. James\r\nBarnett and Mr. Edward Bingham, at present members of the firm. About that\r\ntime they commenced wholesaling, and gradually built up a business from\r\nfive thousand dollars the first year, to a million dollars. This, however,\r\ninvolved a vast amount of labor, and an indomitable determination to\r\nsucceed by driving business. Mr. Worthington, in the absence of railroads\r\nor other public conveyance, traveled through the adjacent townships and\r\ncounties on horseback, introducing his wares, and obtaining orders which\r\nwould be filled by the carriers' wagons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, G. Worthington]\r\n\r\nRailroads revolutionized trade and gave an impetus to everything, and\r\nestablishments that were on a firm footing before were prepared to take\r\nadvantage of circumstances. This was the case with Mr. Worthington. His\r\nwholesale business has grown enormously, especially since 1860.\r\n\r\nAbout 1862, Mr. Worthington projected the Cleveland Iron and Nail Works,\r\nand, in connection with Mr. W. Bingham, matured the plans and got the\r\nworks into successful operation in about one year from broaching the\r\nproject, the work turned out being of the best quality. The owners of the\r\nworks can sell readily all they make, and furnish active and steady\r\nemployment for about two hundred men.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington has also been extensively interested in blast furnaces and\r\ncoal mining, in the vicinity of Cleveland, and has been very successful in\r\nthem also.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the Cleveland Iron and Nail Company is erecting the\r\nfirst blast furnace within the city limits, calculated for a capacity of\r\nabout three hundred tons per week. The firm have also built works on their\r\ngrounds for the manufacture of gas pipe, which have been in successful\r\noperation for about a year, with the exception of a delay caused by a\r\nfire. This is an important work in a city so rapidly growing as Cleveland,\r\nand will retain many thousand of dollars formerly sent to Philadelphia and\r\nother points.\r\n\r\nOn the passage of the National Bank Law, Mr. Worthington and a number of\r\nother capitalists of the city, organized the First National Bank of\r\nCleveland, with a capital of four hundred thousand dollars, which has\r\nbeen very successful. Mr. Worthington was elected president on its\r\norganization, and still retains the office. He is a director of the Ohio\r\nSavings and Loan Bank, of this city. He is also largely interested in\r\nthe local Insurance interests; vice-president of the Sun, and also\r\ninterested in the Cleveland and Commercial, and is a director of the\r\nHahnemann Life Insurance Company. He is also president of the Cleveland\r\nIron Mining Company, one of the most successful organizations of the\r\nkind in the country.\r\n\r\nNo one man, probably, has done more towards building up the business\r\nportion of the city than has Mr. Worthington. His first building was\r\nerected on the corner of Ontario and St. Clair streets, now occupied by H.\r\nJohnson. Since that time he has erected fifty dwelling-houses, and\r\nfourteen stores.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, he was married to Miss Maria C. Blackmar, of Cleveland, by the\r\nRev. Dr. Aiken. Of the marriage six children have been born, two sons\r\nand four daughters, all living. The oldest son, Ralph, is now a member\r\nof the firm.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, Mr. Worthington became interested in the wholesale dry goods\r\nbusiness in New York City, and has been quite successful in the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nMr. Worthington is a good specimen of a self-made man, who was not\r\nspoiled in the making. Hard work did not harden his character, nor has\r\nprosperity turned his head. Coming to Cleveland without a dollar, he has\r\nbuilt up a large fortune by sheer hard work, close application to\r\nbusiness and strict business habits. He at the same time built up a fine\r\nreputation by his integrity of character and scrupulous honesty in his\r\ndealings. At fifty-six years of age, his health is now, as it has always\r\nbeen, remarkably good; he has never been detained from business on\r\naccount of sickness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nN. E. Crittenden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the best known names in this city, to new as well as old citizens,\r\nis that of N. E. Crittenden. For very many years his jewelry establishment\r\nhas been a landmark in the business district \"on the hill,\" and the\r\ngreater part of the population, for about forty years, have taken their\r\ntime from his clock.\r\n\r\nMr. Crittenden is a Massachusetts Yankee in birth and pedigree, having\r\nbeen born at Conway, July 25th, 1804. In his earlier years he received a\r\ngood common school education, and at the age of eighteen was bound\r\napprentice to the jewelry and watch-making business, serving four years at\r\nGeneva, N. Y., and then removing to Batavia, where he was employed two\r\nyears at the trade, and in Albany one year. In the latter city he married\r\nMiss Mary A. Ogden, soon after the ceremony moving to Batavia, where,\r\nhowever, he made but a short stay. He had determined on setting up on his\r\nown account, and Batavia presented no opening for him. That land of hope\r\nand promise, the West, tempted him as it had tempted others, and with five\r\nhundred dollars in jewelry, purchased on credit, he started westward in\r\nsearch of a place in which to turn his jewelry into cash.\r\n\r\nTaking vessel at Buffalo he came to Cleveland, but there was no harbor,\r\nand the vessel stopped outside to land any passengers for that place, and\r\nthen resumed her trip. Mr. Crittenden concluded not to end his voyage\r\nuntil he had gone farther, and stuck by the ship until he reached Detroit,\r\nwhere he landed and investigated with a view to settling. The prospect was\r\nnot inviting. In order to do business there it was necessary to understand\r\nand speak Canadian French, and Mr. Crittenden's acquirements in that\r\ndirection were not extensive. Detroit was clearly no place for him.\r\n\r\nWhilst roaming around the place he fell in with Mr. Walbridge, who was\r\nseeking a location to open a dry goods business. He too was dissatisfied\r\nwith the inducements Detroit offered, and had almost resolved to abandon\r\nthe attempt and go home. Mr. Crittenden had reached the same conclusion,\r\nand the two took the boat on the return trip, thoroughly disenchanted with\r\nthe business prospects of the West. When the boat reached Cleveland they\r\nconcluded to land and take a look at the place before they utterly turned\r\ntheir backs on the western country.\r\n\r\nIt was in September, 1826. The village was pleasantly situated, and the\r\nlocation impressed the strangers favorably. The houses had an appearance\r\nof thrift and comfort, and there was an air of New England enterprise\r\nabout the settlement that confirmed the good impression formed at the\r\napproach. Mr. Crittenden turned to his companion and announced his\r\ndetermination to go no farther; he had found the object of his search.\r\nThat he might satisfy himself of the probable future of the settlement he\r\ngot a conveyance and rode into the country to see what were the\r\nsurroundings of the embryo city. As he passed up through the street his\r\nears were saluted with drum and fife, the people were all out in their\r\nholiday clothes, and teams, loaded with old folks and young folks, were\r\ncoming into town, for it was \"general training.\" The farther he rode and\r\nthe more he saw, the more firmly he became convinced that here was to be\r\nhis future home, and before long his five hundred dollars' worth of\r\njewelry found purchasers among the lads and lasses, and some of the older\r\nfolks, of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nHis first store occupied the site of his present store on Superior street,\r\nand here, in a little building, he opened his original stock. The land he\r\nsubsequently purchased of Levi Johnson, through the medium of Leonard\r\nCase, the purchase money being one thousand dollars for twenty-eight\r\nfeet, with three years' time in which to make the payments. The exorbitant\r\nprice horrified some of the old settlers, and one of them gravely shook\r\nhis head, announcing his firm belief that such a sum of money for such a\r\nbit of land would turn Levi Johnson's head with unlooked for prosperity.\r\nThe price would scarcely be called high in the present day, when land then\r\nconsidered far away in the distant country sells readily at higher rates.\r\nIn the spring of 1827, having secured his store and sold out most of his\r\noriginal stock, he started East to make his first purchases and to bring\r\nhis wife to Cleveland. His friends were surprised and gratified at his\r\nearly return on such an errand. With his wife he brought some housekeeping\r\narticles, among other things the third carpet ever brought to the\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, he had so far succeeded in business as to warrant his tearing\r\ndown the old store and building in its stead a store and dwelling\r\ncombined. Great was the admiration of the people at this building and it\r\nwas considered a just source of pride by the people of Cleveland, for to\r\nthe store was an open front, the first seen in the place, and to the\r\nprivate entrance to the dwelling was attached the first door-bell in\r\nCleveland. The glass front and the tingling bell were unfailing sources of\r\nattraction until others adopted the novelty and public curiosity became\r\nsated. The building was well known to all who lived in the city previous\r\nto 1865, for it remained until, at that date, it had to give way to the\r\nlarger, more elegant, and far more costly structure.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, Mr. Crittenden purchased the Giddings place, on the north side of\r\nthe Public Square, with the stone residence on it, then considered an\r\nelegant mansion. The price paid for the lot, house and furniture was ten\r\nthousand dollars--a high price as rates then were, but marvellously cheap\r\nnow. To that house he removed his family from over his store, and lived\r\nthere twenty-five years, when it was turned over to business purposes.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1853, he erected the fine business block on Water street,\r\nnow occupied by Stillson, Leek & Doering, at a cost of fifteen thousand\r\ndollars. In 1868, he put up the handsome block on the same street that is\r\noccupied by Childs & Co. The cost of this was not less than forty thousand\r\ndollars, and it is a decided ornament to the street. The purchase of the\r\nland and the erection of those elegant blocks, in addition to the one\r\noccupied by his own business, furnish sufficient evidence of the\r\nprosperity of his jewelry business, the regular stock of which has grown\r\nfrom an investment of five hundred dollars to one of more than a hundred\r\nand twenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, N. E. Crittenden]\r\n\r\nBut it must not be supposed that this prosperity was uninterrupted\r\nthroughout Mr. Crittenden's business life. There were dark storms which\r\nthreatened disastrous wreck, and nothing but stead-fastness of purpose and\r\nforce of character brought him through. In 1836 the financial tornado\r\nswept over the land and stripped nearly every business man bare. When the\r\nstorm was at its height Mr. Crittenden found himself with fifty thousand\r\ndollars of New York debts past due, and without the money to pay them.\r\nCollections were cut off, and whilst he was thus unable to raise the means\r\nfrom his debtors, his creditors were likewise stopped from pouncing upon\r\nhim. Other men in like condition were compounding with their creditors,\r\nand thus getting out of their difficulties by partial repudiation. Mr.\r\nCrittenden declined to avail himself of the opportunity, and, in course of\r\ntime, his creditors were paid in full, though that result was brought\r\nabout by years of toil, of steady, persistent application to business, of\r\nshrewd financiering, and of rigid economy.\r\n\r\nIn his early days in Cleveland he was chosen one of the village\r\ntrustees. In 1828, when he held that office, and Richard Hilliard was\r\npresident of the Board of Trustees, the members gathered one afternoon\r\nin an office and voted an appropriation of two hundred dollars to put\r\nthe village in proper order. Great was the outcry at this wastefulness,\r\non the part of some of the tax payers. One of the old citizens, who yet\r\nlives, met Mr. Crittenden and wanted to know what on earth the trustees\r\ncould find in the village to spend two hundred dollars about. At a later\r\ndate, when Cleveland was a city and Mr. Crittenden a member of the\r\nCouncil, it was voted to appropriate ten thousand dollars to protect the\r\nlake front from encroachments by the lake. Again was Mr. Crittenden met\r\nand upbraided for his extravagance in municipal affairs, such conduct\r\ntending to bankrupt the city.\r\n\r\nIt is Mr. Crittenden's pride that he has had no serious litigation, his\r\ncare in making contracts having saved him the unpleasant necessity of\r\nresorting to legal means to compel his debtors to fulfil their\r\nobligations. But whilst looking thus sharply after his own interests,\r\navarice or parsimony has formed no part of his character, and he has been\r\nliberal according to his means.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Otis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Otis was one of those pioneer business men, who settled in Ohio\r\nduring the dark times which followed the war of 1812. He was one of those\r\nto whom we owe much, but of whom the present generation know little; who\r\nwithout capital or education gave an impetus to the Western settlement, by\r\nintegrity, personal energy, economy, and good sense. By force of character\r\nalone, which was their only capital, they wrought such wonders that the\r\nwilderness was literally transposed into fruitful fields.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis left his paternal home in Massachusetts, about the year 1818, on\r\nfoot, to seek a home in the West. Having reached Johnstown, in the\r\nAllegheny Mountains, he hired for a few months as man of all work, in an\r\niron establishment, and thence set forward, travelling as before, by way\r\nof Pittsburgh, to the township of Bloomfield, in Trumbull county, Ohio.\r\nHis physical constitution was equal to the labors of a new country, which\r\nhad nothing to recommend it but a rich soil, and which required above all\r\nthings perseverance and hard work. He cleared land, furnished the settlers\r\nwith goods, for which they paid in ashes, or wheat, and kept a comfortable\r\ntavern for the accommodation of travelers. The ashes were manufactured by\r\nhimself into \"black salts\" or impure potash, more often styled \"Pots,\"\r\nwhich was the only strictly cash article in the country. It was necessary\r\nto haul the casks of potash to the mouth of Beaver river, or to\r\nPittsburgh, from whence they drifted on flat boats down the Ohio and\r\nMississippi to New Orleans, and from thence were shipped to New York. Much\r\nof the teaming he did himself.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pots\" were exchanged at Pittsburgh for goods, or if shipped furnished\r\na credit for the purchases, with which his wagon was loaded, on the return\r\nto Bloomfield. Currency did not in those days enter into the course of\r\ntrade, because there was barely enough of it in the country to pay taxes.\r\nMr. Otis was frequently obliged to furnish his customers with cash for\r\nthis purpose. When the Erie Canal was finished to Buffalo, the wheat of\r\nthe settlers on the Reserve, for the first time, became a cash article.\r\nThey had an abundance of grain, which they were glad to dispose of at\r\ntwenty-five cents a bushel, payable principally in goods. The canal\r\nfurnished a better outlet for potash than the river. Mr. Otis determined\r\nto try a venture in flour at New York, which he considered the first lot\r\nsent there from the Reserve.\r\n\r\nThere were no flour barrels, and no coopers, at Bloomfield, but a few\r\nmiles north towards the lake there was a good custom grist mill. He went\r\ninto the woods, cut an oak tree, set his men to saw it into blocks of the\r\nright length, from which the rough staves were split. The wheat which his\r\ncustomers brought in, was stored at the mill and ground. When the cooper\r\nstuff was seasoned, the barrels were made, rough enough, but strong, and\r\nhis stock of flour and potash hauled through the mud thirty-five miles to\r\nthe mouth of Ashtabula creek. A schooner was at anchor outside, and as\r\nsoon as his venture was on board, he took passage with it to Buffalo, and\r\nby canal to New York. The New York dealers were surprised and gratified,\r\nfor they perceived at once the capacity of a new country on the shores of\r\nLake Erie, of which they had hitherto only known in theory, not in\r\npractical results. In quality the flour was not behind that of the Genesee\r\ncountry, which seemed a wonder in their eyes. They purchased it readily\r\nand offered every encouragement to the trade and the trader. In process of\r\ntime, wool and pork were added to the staples for the New York market. It\r\nwas by this course of incessant activity during near twenty years of\r\ncountry business, coupled with a sure judgment, that Mr. Otis gradually\r\nacquired a moderate money capital. In 1835 or 1836, he came to this city,\r\nwith his hard earned experience in traffic, and with more ready cash than\r\nmost of our produce dealers then possessed, and entered upon a wider field\r\nof enterprise. He continued to purchase and sell the old class of\r\narticles, pork, flour and potash, to which iron soon became an important\r\naddition. His capital and experience brought him at once into connection\r\nwith many public enterprises, which became necessary to an expanding\r\ncountry, especially such as relate to transportation. One of the earliest\r\ntumpikes in northeastern Ohio was made through Bloomfield, from Warren to\r\nAshtabula. Steamers made their appearance on Lake Erie, and the Ohio canal\r\nextended navigation into the interior. In all these auxiliaries to trade\r\nin the heavy products of the country, Mr. Otis had a friendly interest,\r\nand when railways began to be discussed he saw their value at once.\r\nFinally, after his usual deliberation, he decided that the manufacture of\r\niron was a safe and profitable business at Cleveland; he became the\r\npioneer iron master of the place, with the usual result of his\r\noperations--a large profit on his investment.\r\n\r\nThis example and success laid the foundation of iron manufactures here.\r\nIt required something more than the talents of a shrewd country merchant,\r\nor of a mere money lender, to foresee the coming wants of trade in a\r\ngrowing State, to invest in its banks, railroads and manufactures, and to\r\nrender all these investments profitable. With his increase in wealth there\r\nwas in Mr. Otis no increase of display, and no relaxation of the economy\r\nof early life, but an increasing liberality in public charities,\r\nparticularly those connected with religion. When compared with the\r\nbriskness of modern traffic he was slow and cautious; but having finally\r\nreached a conclusion he never flagged in the pursuit of his plans. He\r\nbelonged to a past generation, but to a class of dealers whose judgment\r\nand perseverance built up the business of the country on a sure basis. In\r\nthe midst of a speculative community in flush times, he appeared to be\r\ncold, dilatory, and over cautions, but he saw more clearly and further\r\ninto the future of a business than younger and more impulsive minds, who\r\nhad less experience in its revulsions.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years previous to his death Mr. Otis was largely\r\ninterested in the banking business of the city. He took a prominent part\r\nin the organization of the State Bank of Ohio, was the originator of the\r\nSociety for Savings in Cleveland, and was for thirteen years its\r\npresident, and at the time of his death was president of the Commercial\r\nNational Bank. He was also connected with the banking firm of Wicks, Otis\r\n& Brownell.\r\n\r\nIn connection with a notice of the originator of the Savings Bank in\r\nCleveland it is appropriate to briefly sketch the history of that\r\norganization, which has worked so much good and which ranks to-day among\r\nthe most important and most valued institutions in the city. The\r\nsuggestion was first made by Mr. Otis in the Winter of 1848-9, and its\r\norganization was advocated on the ground of public benevolence. At the\r\nrequest of several prominent persons, Mr. S. H. Mather, the present\r\nsecretary and treasurer, examined the character and practices of several\r\neastern institutions of a similar character. A charter was drafted,\r\nprincipally from those of two well known institutions of the kind then in\r\noperation at Boston and Hartford. In the New England States every city and\r\nmany villages and country towns have organizations of this character.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1849, the Legislature granted corporate powers to W. A. Otis, H.\r\nW. Clark, L. Handerson, J. Lyman, M. L. Hewitt, N. Brainard, Ralph Cowles,\r\nJ. H. Gorham, A. Seymour, D. A. Shepard, James Gardner, J. A. Harris, J.\r\nH. Bingham, J. A. Briggs, S. H. Mather, J. A. Foot, and C. J. Woolson, and\r\ntheir successors, to be appointed by themselves, the corporate powers to\r\ncontinue thirty years. The corporators appointed John W. Allen president,\r\nS. H. Mather secretary, and J. F. Taintor treasurer, and commenced business\r\nin August, 1849, at the rear of the Merchants Bank, on Bank street. Mr.\r\nTaintor was at the time teller in the Merchants Bank, and it was supposed\r\nthat he could attend to all the business of the Savings Society outside of\r\nbanking hours. This was soon found to be impracticable, and at the end of\r\nabout two years Mr. Taintor withdrew, leaving to Mr. Mather the joint\r\noffice of secretary and treasurer.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three years the deposits were only $100,000. In the latter\r\npart of the year 1856, the society became able to have a better office,\r\nand moved into 118 Bank street, corner of Frankfort, under the Weddell\r\nhouse. The deposits in 1859, after ten years of business, were only about\r\n$300,000, but the concern had been so closely managed that a surplus was\r\naccumulating from the profits on investments over the six per cent.\r\ninterest paid to depositors. From that time the business of the\r\ninstitution steadily increased until on the 1st day of January, 1869, its\r\ndeposits considerably exceeded two and a half millions of dollars, and out\r\nof a large surplus had been built one of the finest and most substantial\r\nbuildings in the city, on the north side of the Park. Such have been the\r\nfruits of the suggestion of Mr. Otis; such the success of the organization\r\nin which he took so deep an interest during his life.\r\n\r\nOn the announcement of the death of Mr. Otis, a meeting of bankers was\r\nimmediately called for the purpose of taking some action in testimony of\r\ntheir respect for the deceased. All the banks were fully represented, as\r\nwere the private banking firms. T. M. Kelly, of the Merchants National\r\nBank, was called to the chair, and J. O. Buell, of the Second National\r\nBank, appointed secretary. Appropriate remarks were made by the chairman\r\nand others, after which a committee, composed of T. P. Handy, H. B. Payne,\r\nJoseph Perkins, Henry Wick, and E. B. Hale, reported the following\r\nresolutions, testifying to the respect and esteem felt for Mr. Otis as a\r\nman of business, as a good citizen, and as a Christian:\r\n\r\n  It having pleased God to remove from our midst, on the morning of the\r\n  11th inst., Wm. A. Otis, who, for more than 22 years, has been\r\n  associated with many of us in the business of banking, and has occupied\r\n  a prominent position both in the early organization of the State Bank of\r\n  Ohio, and of the Society for Savings of Cleveland, of which latter\r\n  Society he was for thirteen years president, and at the time of his\r\n  death was the president of the Commercial Bank of this city, and who by\r\n  his wise counsels, his high regard for integrity and mercantile honors as\r\n  well as by an exemplary Christian life, had secured the esteem and\r\n  confidence of his associates and fellow citizens, and who, after a good\r\n  old age, has been quietly gathered to his rest, therefore,\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That while we deeply mourn the loss of our departed brother,\r\n  we commend his virtues, and especially his high standard of Christian\r\n  integrity, for the imitation of the young men of our city as the most\r\n  certain means to a successful business life, and a fitting preparation\r\n  for its final close.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we deeply sympathize with the family of our deceased\r\n  friend in the loss that both they and we are called to sustain, feeling\r\n  assured that after so long a life of Christian fidelity this loss, to\r\n  him is an infinite gain.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions, signed by the Chairman and\r\n  Secretary, be furnished the family of the deceased and be duly published\r\n  in our city papers.\r\n\r\n  J. C. Buell, Secretary. T. M. Kelly, Chairman.\r\n  Cleveland, May 12, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nE. P. Morgan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He who works most achieves most,\" is a good motto in business, and in\r\npursuits of all kinds. This has been the principle on which E. P. Morgan\r\nhas acted throughout life, and a faithful persistence in carrying it out\r\nhas resulted in building up a mammoth business and the consequent\r\npossession of a handsome fortune.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan was born in New London, Connecticut, in 1807. His early years\r\nwere spent at home and in attending school, where a good common education\r\nwas gained. In his fifteenth year he was taken from school and placed in a\r\nstore, where he acquired those business habits which have made him a\r\nsuccessful and wealthy merchant. At the age of twenty-one, he set up in\r\nbusiness for himself, at Middlefield, Massachusetts, carrying on a store,\r\nand at the same time engaging in the manufacture of woolen goods. In this\r\nstore he continued twelve years, doing the whole time a thriving and\r\nprofitable business.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, he bade adieu to Massachusetts and came west to Ohio, taking up\r\nhis future home in Cleveland. He plunged into business immediately on\r\narriving, opening a store on the north side of Superior street, in the\r\nplace now occupied by the store of Mould & Numsen. In 1857, he saw what he\r\nbelieved to be a more eligible site for business in the corner of Superior\r\nand Seneca streets, and to that point he removed in 1858. At the same\r\ntime the firm of Morgan & Root was formed by admitting to partnership Mr.\r\nR. R. Root. To the retail dry goods business was now added a wholesale\r\ndepartment, as also a millinery department, and subsequently a grocery.\r\nThe business was vigorously pushed and every department grew with\r\nremarkable rapidity, until store after store was added to the\r\nestablishment. The \"corner store\" became known far and wide, and a very\r\nlarge country trade was built up in the jobbing department. During the\r\nlast three years of the war, the business of the firm reached an amount\r\ngreater than had ever been anticipated by its members, and the old\r\nquarters, capable no longer of extension, became too strait for the\r\nexpanding operations. A number of lots on the east side of Bank street,\r\nbetween the Herald building and Frankfort street, being purchased by\r\nMorgan & Root, were speedily disencumbered of the drinking saloons and\r\npetty shops that covered them, and on their site soon arose one of the\r\nfinest business blocks in the city, estimated to cost sixty thousand\r\ndollars in addition to the cost of the land. When the block was finished\r\nthe wholesale department of the business was removed to the new building,\r\nleaving the retail department to be carried on in the old store. In\r\nFebruary, 1869, the retail business was sold out to new parties, and\r\nthereafter the firm of Morgan & Root confined itself exclusively to the\r\nwholesale trade.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Morgan is one of the best business men of the city is proved by\r\nthe fact that he has failed in no one of his undertakings; not that he\r\nhas always sailed on a smooth current of success, but that when\r\ndifficulties arose his indomitable perseverance enabled him to overcome\r\nthem. He engaged in no enterprise without its having been based on good\r\nevidence and sound judgment; he never wavered in his adherence to it, nor\r\nslackened for a moment his endeavors to prove his faith sound; nor has he\r\nonce been disappointed as to the result. Few men have shown a like\r\nperseverance. His habits of keen investigation and strict attention to\r\nhis affairs, enabled him to do a very safe, though a very enterprising\r\nbusiness, and consequently he had little occasion for professional\r\nacquaintance with lawyers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his mercantile business, Mr. Morgan has interested himself\r\nin insurance matters, being president of the State Fire Insurance Company,\r\nof Cleveland, which position he has held since the organization of the\r\ncompany in 1863. Under his presidency the company has done a safe and\r\nsuccessful business, and has extended its operations so that it has\r\noffices in Connecticut and other parts of New England. He is also\r\nconnected with the banking affairs of the city. In the earlier years of\r\nhis business in Cleveland, he became interested in the construction of the\r\ncanal around the rapids of Saut St. Marie, and during the progress of the\r\nwork had a store open at the Saut.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, he built his residence on Euclid street, near the corner of\r\nHuntington street, where he has resided since that time. Though sixty-two\r\nyears of age, he is still as active and vigorous as ever, and bids fair to\r\nlong be an active member, in fact as well as in title, of the firm of\r\nMorgan & Root.\r\n\r\nIn religious principles Mr. Morgan is a Presbyterian. For a long time he\r\nwas a member of the Second Presbyterian Church, but of late has been\r\nconnected with the Euclid street Presbyterian Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, he was married to Miss Laura Nash, of Middleford, Mass., by whom\r\nhe has had seven children, all but one of whom still live. The oldest son,\r\nWilliam Morgan, now thirty-one years old, is engaged in the manufacture\r\nand sale of lubricating oils. The second son, Edmund N. Morgan, is an\r\nassistant in his father's store. A daughter, Helen, is the wife of Mr.\r\nJ. B. Merriam, of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Hanna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe commercial interests of Cleveland and of the Lake Superior mineral\r\nregion have for many years been intimately connected, several of the now\r\nprominent citizens of Cleveland having been attracted to Lake Superior by\r\nthe reports of its mineral riches at the time those riches were first made\r\ngenerally known, and Cleveland being found a convenient base of supplies\r\nfor the mining enterprises on the shores of the \"father of lakes.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest to take an interest in this trade was Robert Hanna.\r\nWhilst living in Columbiana county, Ohio, where he had been brought up, he\r\nwas attracted by the representations of the mineral riches of the far off\r\nnorthern lakes, and in 1845 he started off to see for himself what was\r\ntruth in these reports, and what exaggeration. Traveling and exploration\r\nin the wilds of the Lake Superior country were very difficult in that day,\r\nand those who were anxious to make a fortune out of the bowels of the\r\nearth had to rough it, pretty much as the seekers of gold have to now in\r\nthe tangled wilderness to the west of Lake Superior. Mr. Hanna spent four\r\nmonths in careful exploration, and at length becoming satisfied that there\r\nwas something in the rumors of mineral riches, obtained from the\r\ndepartment, in whose charge the territory then was, a permit to locate\r\nthree square miles of copper lands. This being accomplished, he returned\r\nto set about the organization of a company to work the prospective mines.\r\n\r\nWhilst at Marquette, on his return from exploring the copper region, Mr.\r\nHanna fell in with a man who had been exploring the country back of that\r\nplace, and who brought in a specimen of iron ore which he had come\r\nacross in his search. The ore was so heavy, and apparently rich in iron,\r\nthat it was taken to a blacksmith, who, without any preparatory\r\nreduction of the ore, forged from it a rude horseshoe. The astonishment\r\nof those hitherto unacquainted with the existence of raw iron so nearly\r\npure metal, can be imagined.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hanna's attention, like those of most of the searchers after\r\nminerals in that region, was absorbed in copper, and as we have seen, he\r\nlocated his copper tract and returned home to provide means for working\r\nit. A company was formed, materials purchased and miners engaged, and the\r\nwork pressed forward vigorously. The question of forwarding supplies being\r\nnow an important one, Mr. Hanna removed to Cleveland, that being the most\r\nfavorable point for the purchase and shipment of the articles needed, and\r\nopened a wholesale grocery establishment in 1852, combining with it a\r\nforwarding and commission business. At that time the wholesale grocery\r\nbusiness was in its infancy, there being but two or three establishments\r\nof the kind in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nFor some time after the establishment of Mr. Hanna in the wholesale\r\ngrocery business, the carrying trade between Cleveland and Lake Superior\r\nwas mostly in the hands of the Turner Brothers, whose one steamer, the\r\nNortherner, was able to do all the business that offered, both in freight\r\nand passengers. Mr. Hanna's firm, then composed of himself, his brother,\r\nLeonard Hanna, and H. Garretson, under the firm name of Hanna, Garretson &\r\nCo., decided on the bold step of competing for the trade by building a\r\nsteamer of their own. The City of Superior, a screw steamer, was built in\r\nCleveland, under the especial supervision of Dr. Leonard Hanna, and the\r\nmost scrupulous care was exercised to make her in all respects a model\r\nboat for the trade. Great strength of hull and power of machinery were\r\ninsisted on, in order to withstand the dangers of the formidable coast\r\nwhen the fierce storms of the Fall season rendered navigation hazardous.\r\nAccommodation for passengers on the voyage, which took several days for\r\nits full extent, had to be provided, and great care was taken in this\r\nrespect to make the voyage as attractive as possible, attention having\r\nbeen somewhat turned to the Lake Superior country as a Summer resort,\r\nwhere the sultry beats of the \"lower country\" could be exchanged for pure\r\nair and cooling breezes. When launched, the City of Superior proved a\r\ncomplete success, and her first voyage up was a perfect ovation, a new era\r\nhaving been opened in the history of travel between the upper and middle\r\nlakes. But, unhappily, this fine steamer was lost in a storm after a few\r\nvoyages, although the great strength of her hull kept her intact, though\r\nlying across a rock, until she could be completely stripped of her cargo,\r\nfurniture and machinery.\r\n\r\nNo time was spent in fruitless lamentations over the destruction of the\r\nwork of which they were so proud, and about which so many anticipations\r\nfor the future had been indulged in. No sooner had the news been\r\nconfirmed, than a contract was made for the construction of another\r\nsteamer, larger and better in all respects than her unfortunate\r\npredecessor, and the result was the Northern Light, which proved a great\r\nfavorite, and is still running. Other steamers were chartered to run in\r\nconnection with her, and their success caused rival lines to be run, thus\r\nbuilding up the Lake Superior trade to dimensions exceeding the most\r\nsanguine expectations of the pioneers in it. To this house belongs a very\r\nlarge share of the credit due for bringing such an important proportion\r\nof this trade to Cleveland. When Mr. Hanna first endeavored to interest\r\nthe people of Cleveland in Lake Superior matters, he was frequently met\r\nwith inquiries as to the whereabouts, not only of the copper region of\r\nLake Superior, but of Lake Superior itself, about which very confused\r\nnotions existed.\r\n\r\nThe copper company organized by Mr. Hanna expended over half a million\r\ndollars in developing the deposit, and produced several hundred tons of\r\nore, but it was not a financial success, the fine copper not being in\r\npaying proportion in the ore. After a few years Mr. Hanna sold out his\r\ninterest in this company, but has retained interests in other enterprises\r\nin that region, some of which have been very remunerative.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Dr. Leonard Hanna, and the withdrawal of Mr. Garretson,\r\nthe firm of Hanna, Garretson & Co. became dissolved, and was changed to\r\nRobert Hanna & Co., the younger members of the Hanna families taking\r\ninterest in the firm. Recently Robert Hanna has retired from active\r\nparticipation in its affairs, having turned his attention in other\r\ndirections. During the past four years he has been engaged in the oil\r\nrefining business, having a refinery with a capacity of a hundred and\r\nsixty barrels a day, which has proved very successful. He is also\r\npresident of the Cleveland Malleable Iron Works, the first of the kind in\r\nthis part of the country, and which at present promises well. The\r\ngentlemen associated with Mr. Hanna in this enterprise have united with\r\nhim in the determination to make it a successful enterprise, and have such\r\nmanagement for it that it can scarcely fail to meet their expectations.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Mr. Hanna projected what resulted in the organization and\r\nestablishment of the Ohio National Bank, of Cleveland, on January 1st,\r\n1869, with an authorized capital of one million dollars, and with a paid\r\nup capital of six hundred thousand dollars. It was organized with more\r\nespecial reference to the interests of merchants, mechanics and\r\nmanufacturers, and men representing these respective interests are the\r\nprincipal owners of its stock. The institution thus far gives promise of\r\ncomplete success. Mr. Hanna is the president; A. Cobb, vice-president;\r\nJohn McClymonds, cashier.\r\n\r\nStill in the prime of life, Mr. Hanna has the satisfaction of knowing that\r\nhe has been very successful, has built up a large fortune for himself and\r\ndone a very important work in building up the material interests of the\r\ncity, both commercial and manufacturing. Although well able to retire from\r\nactive life, and live in ease at his fine residence on Prospect street, he\r\nprefers to do what yet lies in his power to build up the prosperity of\r\nCleveland still higher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS. F. Lester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel F. Lester was born in Albany county, New York, in 1818. His youth\r\nwas spent under advantageous circumstances, and he obtained a good\r\neducation. At the age of fifteen he left the Academy where he had been\r\nstudying and entered on his commercial education by becoming clerk in a\r\ncountry store, where he remained five years. Having reached his twentieth\r\nyear, he bade adieu to home, and came west to seek his fortune. His\r\nfirst stay was at Clinton, Michigan, where he carried on business\r\nsuccessfully for three years, and married Miss Cornelia Eliza Brown, of\r\nTecumseh, daughter to General Joseph W. Brown, and niece of Major General\r\nJacob Brown, of Brownville, N. Y., the hero of Chippewa, Fort Erie and\r\nSackett's Harbor.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of the three years Mr. Lester's health gave way, through\r\nhis assiduous devotion to business, and he returned to his father's house\r\nin Albany county, New York, remaining there a year, unable to engage in\r\nbusiness of any kind. For the two succeeding years he worked on his\r\nfather's farm, and in this way succeeded in regaining his health.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1845, he again turned his face westward, and landed at\r\nCleveland, where he became a member of the firm of Hubby, Hughes & Co.,\r\nremaining in it until its dissolution. The house of Hubby, Hughes & Co.\r\ncarried on a very extensive business on the lakes and canal. The firm, in\r\nconnection with J. C. Evans, of Buffalo, projected the first line of\r\npropellers between Buffalo, Cleveland and Toledo, and the line was a\r\ndecided financial success. It continued to do a steadily increasing\r\nbusiness until the consolidation of most of the independent lines into the\r\nAmerican Transportation Co.'s line. A number of lake vessels also belonged\r\nthe house, and a line of canal boats belonging to the firm ran between\r\nCleveland and Portsmouth, and between Cleveland and Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the firm of William A. Otis & Co., the firm built the\r\nfirst elevator for railroad business in the city, the elevator, at the\r\nfoot of River street, being now occupied by W. F. Otis & Son. Subsequent to\r\nthis the firm erected the National Mills, at the heavy cost of seventy\r\nthousand dollars, it being then, and now, one of the finest and most\r\ncostly mills in the State of Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, the firm of Hubby, Hughes & Co. was dissolved, and the business\r\nwas carried on under the firm name of Hughes & Lester, which was continued\r\nsuccessfully until 1862. In January of that year, Mr. Lester went to New\r\nYork on the business of the firm. Whilst there he was suddenly stricken\r\nwith paralysis, and lay unknown and helpless for sometime. He was at\r\nlength identified and cared for, but for a long time was in great danger,\r\nand for a still longer time utterly unable to do business of any kind. His\r\nserious and continued illness necessitated the breaking up of the firm,\r\nand accordingly on the first of January, 1863, the firm of Hughes & Lester\r\nwas dissolved. On the following March, his health having been partially\r\nrestored, Mr. Lester once more entered into business, opening a produce\r\ncommission warehouse, and meeting with success.\r\n\r\nIt is the just pride of Mr. Lester that he has always escaped litigation\r\nIt is also a fact worthy of notice and imitation, that Mr. Lester has\r\nalways given strict personal attention to all the details of his business\r\nknowing them all from the cellar to the counting-room, in the latter of\r\nwhich places he is most thoroughly at home.\r\n\r\nMr. Lester was one of the original stockholders of the Commercial\r\nInsurance Company, and a director and member of the executive committee\r\nfor several years. He has twice been elected Commissioner of Water Works.\r\nMr. Lester has, all through his commercial life enjoyed to an unusual\r\ndegree, the confidence and esteem of his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Yours Truly, A. Bradley\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlva Bradley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the very many who see for the first time the name of Alva Bradley, the\r\nquestion will naturally arise, \"Who is he?\" and some wonder may be\r\nexpressed at finding a name so little known to the general public on the\r\nlist of those who have contributed largely to the commercial prosperity of\r\nCleveland. And yet Alva Bradley is one of the largest ship-owners of the\r\ncity, and his name is well enough known among those interested in the\r\nshipping of the western lakes. That he is no better known outside of his\r\npeculiar circle of business men is owing solely to his modest and\r\nunostentatious character, he preferring to pursue the even tenor of his\r\nway and confine himself strictly to his own affairs.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bradley was born in Connecticut in the year 1814, and lived in\r\nthat State until his ninth year. Then his father emigrated to Ohio, taking\r\nhis family with him, and settled in Lorain county. Young Bradley had few\r\nadvantages in early life. He earned his first pair of boots by chopping\r\nwood, and when the first suspenders, knitted by his mother, were worn out,\r\nthe next pair were paid for by chopping hoop-poles.\r\n\r\nUntil his twenty-first year he worked with his father on a farm, and\r\nthen left to seek his fortune in the world, with all his effects carried\r\nunder his arm, wrapped in a cotton handkerchief. His first entry on\r\nindependent life was as a deck-hand, before the mast of the schooner\r\nLiberty. In that capacity he remained two years, and then, having acquired\r\na good knowledge of seamanship, was made mate, holding that rank two\r\nyears. In 1839, he rose a step higher, and for two seasons was master of\r\nthe Commodore Lawrence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bradley now commenced his career as an owner as well as master of\r\nvessels. In 1841, he had built for him, in company with Mr. A. Cobb, then\r\na merchant at Birmingham, Ohio, the schooner South America, of 104 tons.\r\nWhen she was completed he took command of her and sailed her for three\r\nseasons. In 1844, in company with Mr. Cobb, he had built the schooner\r\nBirmingham, of 135 tons burden, and taking command of her himself, sailed\r\nher three years. In 1848, the same parties built the Ellington, of 185\r\ntons, which Capt. Bradley sailed for one year. The following year he\r\nshifted his command to the propeller Indiana, 350 tons burden, which he\r\nand his associate, Mr. Cobb, had built for the Buffalo and Chicago trade.\r\nCapt. Bradley ran her himself three years and then returned to a sailing\r\nvessel, having late in the season of 1852, turned off the stocks a smart\r\nnew schooner, the Oregon, of 190 tons burden, which he ran to the end of\r\nher first season, and then bade adieu to sea-faring life. During his many\r\nyears' life on the lakes, in various craft and under all kinds of\r\ncircumstances, it is remarkable that he never met with a serious casualty;\r\nhe was enterprising, active, vigorous in mind and body; a prudent business\r\nman and at the same time a thorough sailor.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1853, he resumed his work of increasing his lake navy by\r\nbuilding the Challenge, of 238 tons, followed by one or more vessels\r\nyearly. In 1854 was built the Bay City, 190 tons; in 1855 the C. G.\r\nGriswold, 359 tons; in 1856 the schooners Queen City, 368 tons, and\r\nWellington, 300 tons; in 1858 the schooner Exchange, 390 tons. At this\r\npoint he rested three years and then resumed work.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 was built, in company with other parties, the S. H. Kimball, 418\r\ntons; in 1863 the Wagstaff, 412 tons; in 1864 the J. F. Gard, 370 tons; in\r\n1865 the schooner Escanaba, 568 tons; in 1866-7, the schooner Negaunee,\r\n850 tons, a splendid vessel, costing over $52,000, which has been running\r\nin the Lake Superior iron ore trade, and which has proved a very\r\nprofitable investment; in 1868 he built the schooner Fayette Brown, 713\r\ntons, and the tug W. Cushing, for harbor towing; in 1869 the S. F. Tilden,\r\n1,000 tons, was launched from the yard of Quayle & Martin, completing the\r\nlist of vessels built by or for Captain Bradley, making a list of nineteen\r\nvessels, and a tug, besides a number of vessels purchased. The present\r\nfleet is composed of nine vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of nearly\r\nfive thousand tons, besides two tugs, one plying in Cleveland harbor and\r\nthe other, in which he has half interest, at the Sault.\r\n\r\nThe record of the vessels built for Captain Bradley, and their respective\r\ntonnage, given above, shows at a glance the gradual development of the\r\nlake shipping commerce. The first of his fleet, the South America, 104\r\ntons, built in 1841, was a very respectable craft in her day. From that\r\ntime there was a steady increase in the tonnage of the vessels built,\r\nuntil it culminates in the S. F. Tilden, with carrying capacity of a\r\nthousand tons burden, but just launched from the stocks.\r\n\r\nThough owning at one time or another such a large fleet of vessels, the\r\ncasualties to them were very few, and the enterprise has proved steadily\r\nremunerative. The schr. Dayton, Maria Cobb, Oregon, South America, and\r\nQueen City, is the complete list of vessels lost.\r\n\r\nThough shipping absorbed the greater portion of Captain Bradley's\r\nattention, his interest was not wholly confined to this branch of\r\nbusiness. His time, means, and energy were largely employed in the\r\nmanufacture of iron, and in other commercial interests. It is his pride\r\nthat though so largely interested in business of different kinds, he has\r\nhad but one case of litigation, and that with an insurance company. His\r\nrecord needs no eulogy; it speaks for itself as the record of a man of\r\nenergy, enterprise and prudence.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bradley's health had for some years not been good, but is now\r\nimproving, and there is a reasonable prospect that one who has done so\r\nmuch to develop the shipping interest of the port will live for some time\r\nyet to enjoy the fruits of his energy and industry.\r\n\r\nMr. Bradley was married in August, 1849, to Ellen Burgess, of Milan, Ohio,\r\nwho is still living. Of the marriage, four children have been born, three\r\ngirls and one boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWellington P. Cooke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of W. P. Cooke is an instance of what can be\r\naccomplished under the most adverse circumstances, when to\r\npersistent energy and laudable ambition are added the patience and\r\nfaith born of religions training.\r\n\r\nThe parents of Mr. Cooke were pioneer settlers in Otsego county, New\r\nYork, where his father died whilst Wellington was quite a small boy. His\r\nmother removed to a still newer country, Macomb county, Michigan, and\r\nthere died, leaving the lad to fight his own way through the world\r\nwithout the advantages of either money or education. In the year 1838,\r\nbeing then but thirteen years old, he became a printer's apprentice.\r\nSubsequently he removed to Chagrin Falls, Ohio, where he secured some\r\neducational privileges at a seminary, obtaining the money for his\r\nnecessary expenses by working early in the morning, at night, and on\r\nSaturday. He found employment in the village and among the neighboring\r\nfarmers. But with all his efforts his lot was a hard one. He often needed\r\nthe necessaries, to say nothing of the comforts of life, frequently\r\nmaking his morning and evening meal out of potatoes and salt, the former\r\nbeing of his own cooking, as he boarded himself. These articles were\r\npurchased in many instances by money received for sawing wood on the\r\nschool holiday of Saturday.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, he came to Cleveland, tramping in from Chagrin Falls on foot, and\r\nhaving half a dollar as his sole capital with which to commence life in\r\nthe city. His first attempt to gain work was in a printing office, where\r\nhe succeeded in getting a case, receiving his pay, according to the custom\r\nof the times, in orders on grocery and clothing stores. After this he was\r\nforeman and compositor in the office of a monthly publication, called the\r\nFarmers' Journal, where he continued to devote his spare time to reading\r\nand study. Subsequently he became a clerk in a grocery store at a salary\r\nof ninety-six dollars a year. With this small sum he not only supported\r\nhimself, but gave pecuniary aid to a sister, and something to the church.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, he obtained an interest in the business, and the partnership thus\r\ncontinued for three years. His reputation as a moral and religious man,\r\ntogether with a great spirit of enterprise, rapidly enlarged his business,\r\nand pointed out new channels for money-making.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. P. Cooke]\r\n\r\nIn 1850, he disposed of the grocery business, and directed his whole\r\nefforts to the hide and leather trade. In this he showed much judgment,\r\nfor the business he selected has proved to be one of the most extensive\r\nand profitable of the West. A nephew, since deceased, about this time\r\nbecame a partner. The premises occupied became too small, and a lot on\r\nWater street was purchased, where a fine store was erected, which is the\r\npresent place of business.\r\n\r\nThe firm, which for some time existed as W. P. Cooke & Co., has been\r\nchanged to Cooke & Denison, the junior partner being a former clerk, and\r\nunder that name it is well known throughout the country, and especially in\r\nthe West, as one of the largest establishments in the West dealing in\r\nleather, hides, wool, pelts and oil.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke joined the Methodist Church at a very early age, and to the\r\nreligious influences with which he was thus surrounded, he attributes much\r\nof his success in life. As a Church-member he was led to avoid all places\r\nof doubtful morality, and thus escaped the temptations and vices which\r\ndestroy so many young men. He has always been strictly temperate, and does\r\nnot use tobacco in any form. He is now prominently connected with the\r\nFirst Methodist Episcopal Church of Cleveland, and is noted as a zealous\r\nlaborer in the Sunday School cause.\r\n\r\nMr. Cooke's religion is not of that kind that is left in the church pew\r\non Sunday night, to remain undisturbed until the next Sunday morning, but\r\nis carried into all his relations of life and influences all his\r\nmovements. The principles of justice and charity taught by the Christian\r\nfaith are by him carried into his business dealings and social relations.\r\nStrictly just in business transactions, liberal in his charities to\r\nworthy objects, and generous to the church, he exemplifies in his life\r\nthe fact that true Christian principles are not incompatible with strict\r\nbusiness habits, and conduce to commercial success. Remembering his early\r\ndifficulties, he takes particular interest in young men, sympathizing\r\nwith them in their struggles, and aiding them with counsel and timely\r\nassistance where needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram Garretson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm of Hanna, Garretson & Co. has already been mentioned. The second\r\nmember of the firm, while it existed under that name, Hiram Garretson,\r\ncame like the others from Columbiana county, where he had been brought up,\r\nalthough not a native of the county. Mr. Garretson was born in York\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, his parents being respectable members of the Society\r\nof Friends. When he was very young the family removed to Columbiana\r\ncounty, Ohio, where the senior Garretson opened a country store in New\r\nLisbon. Hiram was sent to school, receiving a good district school\r\neducation, and was then taken into his father's store as clerk, in which\r\noccupation he remained until he was nineteen years old. At that age he\r\nleft home and engaged in trade on the rivers, taking charge of a trading\r\nboat running from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. This class of boats has not\r\nyet entirely passed away from the Ohio and Mississippi rivers. The\r\nvillages along the river banks were small and badly supplied with stores,\r\ndepending mainly for their supplies on the coasting boats. These are\r\nrudely constructed craft, well stocked with merchandise of all kinds, that\r\ndrop leisurely down the river, tying up at every village or place where\r\nthere is probability of a trade, and remaining there as long as the stay\r\ncan be made profitable, then passing on to the next. When New Orleans has\r\nat last been reached, the boat is sold to be broken up for its materials,\r\nand the trader returns by steamer to get ready for another voyage down. It\r\nwas in business of this description that Mr. Garretson engaged for a time,\r\nand in his voyages down the river and dealings with all sorts of people in\r\ndifferent States, he acquired a valuable knowledge of business and men\r\nthat has stood him since in good stead.\r\n\r\nAt length he tired of this kind of trading and returned to New Lisbon, and\r\ncarried on a moderately successful business until the Winter of 1851. At\r\nthat time a marked change came over the fortunes of New Lisbon. Up to that\r\nperiod it had been a flourishing business place, its advantages of\r\nlocation on the canal in a fertile district, making it one of the best\r\nplaces of trade in that portion of the State. But the construction of Fort\r\nWayne and Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroads effected a great and\r\ndisadvantageous change in the business of New Lisbon. The Fort Wayne road\r\npassed it a few miles north, and the Cleveland and Pittsburgh road ran\r\nabout an equal distance west. Thus New Lisbon was cut off from all the\r\ncommercial cities, and found its sources of supply tapped at every point\r\nby the railroads. Realizing the fate that had overtaken the town, Mr.\r\nGarretson, at the opening of the year 1852, closed up his affairs in\r\nColumbiana county and removed to Cleveland. There he became associated in\r\nbusiness with Messrs. Leonard and Robert Hanna, and the firm of Hanna,\r\nGarretson & Co. was established.\r\n\r\nThe successful operations of that firm have already been chronicled in\r\nthese pages, and it only remains in this place to note the fact, that to\r\nthe success achieved, the energy and uprightness of Mr. Garretson\r\ncontributed in full proportion. The partnership lasted nine years.\r\n\r\nOn its dissolution Mr. Garretson established the house of H. Garretson &\r\nCo., on Water street, with a shipping house on the river. The business of\r\nthe new firm was exactly similar to that of the old one, including a\r\nwholesale grocery trade, with a Lake Superior commission and shipping\r\nbusiness. A line of fine steamers was run to Lake Superior, and the high\r\nreputation Mr. Garretson enjoyed among the people of that section of\r\ncountry, enabled him to build up a very large business in supplying their\r\nwants. In addition, the new firm found customers rapidly increasing in\r\nnorthern and western Ohio, in Michigan, and in other adjoining States. The\r\noperations of the firm extended rapidly until it stood, at the close of\r\nthe year 1867, among the very foremost in the amount of its annual sales,\r\nwhilst the business was eminently a safe and solidly successful one.\r\n\r\nOn the first of November, 1867, Mr. Garretson sold out his wholesale\r\ngrocery business, and thus closed a mercantile career extending in this\r\ncity over sixteen years. His attention was then turned to banking. No\r\nsooner had he retired from mercantile life than he projected and\r\norganized the Cleveland Banking Company, which went into operation under\r\nhis presidency February 1st, 1868, with a capital of three hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand dollars. It immediately found all the business it\r\nwas able to do, and under the skillful management of Mr. Garretson it\r\nhas become one of the most reliable and important financial institutions\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nIt can truthfully be said of Mr. Garretson, that his success in business\r\nhas been owing not more to his shrewdness and foresight than to his\r\nmercantile honor and social qualities. He made personal friends of his\r\nbusiness customers, and by courteous attention, as well as by scrupulous\r\nregard for their interests, retained their good will and secured their\r\ncustom. In all the relations of business and social life, Mr. Garretson\r\nhas uniformly borne himself in such manner as to win the respect and\r\nconfidence of those brought into contact with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Barr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Barr was born in Liberty township, Trumbull county, (now Mahoning,)\r\nOhio, June 26th, 1804. His ancestors, on both sides, were from\r\nWestmoreland county, Pennsylvania, though on his father's side they\r\noriginally came from the north of England, in the days of William Penn;\r\nand his mother's, from Germany.\r\n\r\nHis grandfather, Alexander Barr, was killed by the Indians, in 1785, on\r\nthe Miami, a short distance below, where Hamilton, in Butler county, now\r\nstands. His parents removed from Westmoreland county, Pa., to Youngstown,\r\nin 1800; and his father settled as the Presbyterian pastor of a church in\r\nthat place, and resided there till 1820, when he removed to Wooster, Wayne\r\ncounty, in this State. The subject of this sketch was raised on a farm,\r\nliterally in the woods, and experienced the usual privations and\r\nvicissitudes attendant on pioneer life. The new country and poverty of his\r\nparents prevented his receiving a common English education, and it was not\r\nuntil after he was of age that he mastered Murray's syntax and Daboll's\r\narithmetic.\r\n\r\nOn leaving home in 1825, he repaired to the Ohio canal, (then in process\r\nof construction,) where he labored for two years, at various points\r\nbetween Boston and Tinker's creek; where, with hundreds of others, he was\r\nprostrated by the malaria of that unhealthy valley.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, he settled in Cleveland, and acted as deputy for the late Edward\r\nBaldwin, sheriff. He took the census of the county in 1830, and was\r\nelected sheriff that year, which office he held till 1834. Cleveland city\r\nat that time, contained one thousand and seventy-one inhabitants; its\r\nnorthern boundary was the lake, Erie street on the east, and the Cuyahoga\r\nriver on the west.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, when the idea of connecting Cleveland with other places by means\r\nof railroads, was conceived by John W. Willey, James S. Clarke, T. P.\r\nHandy, Edmund Clark, R. Hilliard, O. M. Gidings, H. B. Payne, Anson Haydn,\r\nH. Canfield and others, Mr. Barr joined in and spent a good deal of time\r\nin furthering the project. Late in the Fall of that year, he visited\r\nCincinnati, distributing petitions along the line of a proposed route to\r\nCincinnati from Cleveland, and spent most of the Winter at Columbus,\r\nduring the session of the Legislature. A charter for that road, and one\r\nfor a road to Pittsburgh, being granted, Mr. Barr brought the first copies\r\nof them, duly certified under the seal of the State, to this city.\r\n\r\nDuring 1836 and 7, Mr. Barr devoted a good deal of time in collecting\r\nstatistics of this port, the business of the city, its population, &c.,\r\n&c., and also of the west generally, and laying them before the public in\r\nthe papers of Philadelphia and other eastern cities. In company with Mr.\r\nWilley and the late Governor Tod, he visited Baltimore, Philadelphia, New\r\nYork and Boston, endeavoring to enlist the attention of capitalists to\r\naid in those enterprises. But the crash of 1837, and the general\r\nprostration of business, that followed all over the country, rendered it\r\nunavailing. In the Winter of 1838, Mr. Gidings, S. Starkweather,\r\nFrederick Whittlesey, Wm. B. Lloyd and Mr. Barr were appointed a\r\ncommittee to attend a railroad convention at Harrisburgh, Pa., to promote\r\nthe project of the railroad from Cleveland to Philadelphia, by way of\r\nPittsburgh. In 1838 and 9, at the request of John W. Willey, he still\r\nspent much of his time in sending a series of articles on the importance\r\nof the project, that were published monthly in the North American, a\r\npaper in Philadelphia devoted to such projects.\r\n\r\nThrough the disastrous state of the times, these various measures had to\r\nyield, and become, for the time being, failures; but time has shown that\r\nthose who were engaged in them were only in advance of the spirit and\r\nmeans of the age.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, when this subject again arrested the attention of the Cleveland\r\npublic, Mr. Barr, although crushed by the storm of 1837, again resumed\r\nthe subject with his pen, and gave to the public in the National\r\nMagazine, published in New York, quite a history of the city, its early\r\nsettlement, &c., together with a full description of the shipping on\r\ntheir lakes, tonnage, trade, &c., that cost weeks of hard labor and\r\npatience, more particularly to place our city in a favorable view before\r\nthe eastern public.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, a friend of Mr. B. sent him a petition to circulate and send to\r\nthe Hon. Thomas Corwin, one of Ohio's Senators, asking Congress for aid to\r\nsurvey and establish a railroad to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIn circulating this petition, Mr. Barr was gravely inquired of by one of\r\nour citizens, \"if he expected to live to see such a road built?\" Mr. Barr\r\nreplied, \"if he should live to the usual age of men, he did expect to see\r\nit commenced, and perhaps built.\" The reply was, \"If you do, you will be\r\nan older man than Methusalah!\" Both have lived to know that great work has\r\nbeen achieved.\r\n\r\nMr. Barr procured over six hundred names to his petition, which was duly\r\npresented by Mr. Corwin. Cleveland has now reason to be proud of the\r\ninterests she manifested in that great work, at so early a day.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Mr. Barr brought the first petroleum to this city, made from\r\ncannel coal, to be used as a source of light. This was new and regarded as\r\nutopian. The article was very odorous, and failed to be acceptable to the\r\npublic, but as time rolled on, improvements in refining were made, and now\r\nthe largest manufacturing business in our city is that of petroleum.\r\n\r\nFew, if any, of citizens have spent more time and pains in collecting and\r\ngiving to the public reminiscences of early days and early settlers--those\r\nwho located in this region, and who under such privations, trials,\r\nhardships and sufferings commenced levelling these mighty forests,\r\nerecting log cabins, and in due time made this formidable wilderness \"bud\r\nand blossom as the rose.\" In that respect Mr. Barr has done much to\r\npreserve and lay before the public from time to time, brief histories of\r\nmany of those brave men and women who left their homes and friends in the\r\neast, and comparative comforts, to settle in the western wilderness, to\r\nbuild up homes for their children and future generations. Howe's history\r\nof Ohio, and Col. Chas. Whittlesey's history of the city of Cleveland,\r\nbear witness that his generous heart and gifted pen have furnished\r\ntributes of respect to the memory of the noble pioneers, after the battle\r\nof life with them was over, and thus supplying links to our historic chain\r\nthat makes it comparatively perfect.\r\n\r\nAmong the many reminiscences of early times related to us by Mr. Barr,\r\nthere is one we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of relating, and\r\npreserving: William Coleman, Esq., came to Euclid in 1803, selected a lot\r\nof land and with his family settled upon it in 1804. For several years the\r\nfew settlers experienced a good deal of inconvenience in having only the\r\nwild game of the country for meat, and which, at certain seasons of the\r\nyear, was unfit for the table. In the Spring the streams that put into the\r\nlake abounded with excellent fish, and the season lasted about four weeks.\r\nThe question arose, \"could these fish be preserved in salt for future\r\nuse?\" The universal answer was No! The idea of preserving _fresh water_\r\nfish in salt seemed incredible; the red man was appealed to, but he shook\r\nhis head in contempt at the idea, and in broken English said, \"put him on\r\npole, dry him over smoke.\" One Spring Mr. Coleman repaired to Rocky River,\r\nfamous for its fine pike and pickerel, and laid in his stock, carefully\r\nlaid them down in salt, which cost him over thirty dollars a barrel, (at a\r\ngreat risk, as his neighbors thought,) and watched them carefully from\r\ntime to time till harvest. Much to his own and his neighbors'\r\nsatisfaction, he found it a success, and proved not only a happy change of\r\ndiet for health, but also a luxury, unknown before. From this\r\ncircumstance, small at that time, originated a new source of comfort,\r\nwhich proved, in time, a mine of wealth to the West, and a luxury to the\r\npersons who located in the interior of the State. Well was it said by the\r\nschool boy of Massachusetts about those days, \"Tall oaks from little\r\nacorns grow, large streams from little fountains flow.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Barr says he made this circumstance a matter of much research and\r\ninquiry, and fully believes that to William Coleman belongs the credit for\r\nso useful and important a discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. B. Cobb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe oldest bookselling house in Cleveland is that of the Cobbs, now\r\nexisting under the firm name of Cobb, Andrews & Co. It has grown with\r\nthe growth of the city, from a small concern where a few books and a\r\nlimited stock of stationery were kept as adjuncts to a job printing\r\noffice, to a large establishment doing an extensive business throughout\r\nthe northern half of Ohio and north-western Pennsylvania, and in parts of\r\nMichigan and Indiana, and which has planted in Chicago a branch that has\r\ngrown to be equal in importance with the parent establishment. Through\r\nfinancial storm and sunshine this house has steadily grown, without a\r\nmishap, and now ranks as one of the most important and staunchest\r\nbusiness houses in the city.\r\n\r\nThe head of the firm, Junius Brutus Cobb, was born in 1822, received a\r\ngood common school education, and was then sent to learn the trade of a\r\ncabinet-maker. When his apprenticeship expired he worked for a short time\r\nas a journeyman, but was dissatisfied with the trade, and for a year or\r\ntwo taught school. In 1842, he decided to try his fortune in the West, and\r\nreached Cleveland, where he found employment as clerk in the store of M.\r\nC. Younglove. Mr. Younglove was then doing a job printing business, and\r\nkept in addition a stock of books and stationery. Opportunity sometime\r\nafter offering, two younger brothers of Mr. Cobb followed him, and were\r\nemployed by Mr. Younglove. In 1848, the three brothers united in the\r\npurchase of an interest in the establishment, and the firm of M. C.\r\nYounglove & Co. was formed, the store being located in the American House\r\nbuilding. Here the firm remained some years, the book trade steadily\r\nincreasing, until the old quarters were too strait for its accommodation.\r\n\r\nIn April 1852, Mr. Younglove parted with his entire interest in the\r\nconcern to his partners, and the firm name of J. B. Cobb & Co. was\r\nadopted. Before this the printing department had been abandoned, and the\r\nconcern was run as a book and stationery store, with a bindery attached.\r\nThe old store being too small, new and more commodious quarters were found\r\nfurther up Superior street on the opposite side, and with the change the\r\nbusiness increased with greater rapidity than previously.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1864, it was decided to open a similar house in Chicago. A\r\nstore was engaged, and Mr. J. B. Cobb went up to open it, taking with him a\r\nrelative of the firm who had formerly been their clerk, Mr. Daniel\r\nPritchard. The business of the new establishment instantly became large\r\nand remunerative, the jobbing trade commencing auspiciously, and rapidly\r\nincreasing to extensive dimensions. At the same time the parent house in\r\nCleveland added a wholesale department to its former retail trade, and\r\nthis grew rapidly, the need of such an establishment being keenly felt by\r\nthe numerous small stores throughout the country that had hitherto been\r\ndependent on Cincinnati or the dealers at the East. The rapid growth of\r\nbusiness in the two establishments necessitated a new arrangement of the\r\nfirm, and Cobb, Pritchard & Co. took charge of the Chicago house, whilst\r\nCobb, Andrews & Co. manage the Cleveland establishment. The latter firm\r\nwas made by the accession of Mr. Theodore A. Andrews, who had been brought\r\nup as a clerk in the house, taking his place as a partner in April, 1865.\r\nMr. J. B. Cobb took up his residence in Chicago, leaving his brothers, C.\r\nC. and B. J., in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe Cobbs have maintained for themselves a high reputation for honesty,\r\nfair dealing, and courtesy in business, and in this way have secured\r\nprosperity. The trade that, when they first took it, amounted to about\r\n$25,000 a year, had grown, in 1868, to over $200,000. The qualities that\r\ngained for the head of the firm so many valuable business friends, was\r\nshared in by his brothers, and these again impressed them on the young men\r\nbrought up under their control. The result is seen in the large number of\r\ncustomers frequenting the store daily, and in the extensive wholesale\r\ntrade done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. G. Colwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Colwell is a native of Madison county, New York, and came to Cleveland\r\nin 1852, soon after the opening of the different railroads had given the\r\ncity an important start in the road to prosperity. Mr. Colwell immediately\r\nengaged in the hardware trade, on Ontario street, where he has continued\r\nto the present day. As the city grew in size, and its area of commerce\r\nextended, the business of Mr. Colwell steadily increased. The retail trade\r\ngradually developed into wholesale, and this grew into important\r\nproportions, pushing its ramifications through northern Ohio, Michigan,\r\nand north-western Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMr. Colwell has attended closely to his business, taking no other interest\r\nin public affairs than is the duty of every good citizen. But whilst\r\ncarefully conducting his business he has found time for the gratification\r\nof a cultivated taste in literature, and has taken pleasure in\r\nparticipating in every movement designed to foster a similar taste in\r\nothers. In a recent tour in Europe, undertaken for the benefit of his\r\nhealth, he visited the principal points of literary and artistic interest,\r\nand brought back with him many rare and curious souvenirs of travel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Bingham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst few men, if there are any, in the city of Cleveland are more highly\r\nrespected than William Bingham, there are none less desirous of notoriety\r\nin any form. To do his duty to himself, his family, and his fellow men,\r\nand to do it quietly and unobtrusively, is the extent of Mr. Bingham's\r\nambition, so far as can be judged by the whole tenor of his life. Did the\r\nmatter rest with him, no notice of him would have appeared in this work,\r\nbut to omit him would be a manifest injustice, and would at the same time\r\nrender the volume imperfect.\r\n\r\nMr. Bingham is a native of Andover, Connecticut, and on his arrival here\r\nfrom the East, became a clerk in George Worthington's hardware store.\r\nAfter a few years' service in this capacity, he set up in the same line\r\nfor himself, and for about a quarter of a century has carried on\r\nbusiness with marked success. The operations of the firm of William\r\nBingham & Co., though at first small, have grown to large proportions,\r\nand Mr. Bingham has grown rich, not through lucky operations, but by\r\nsteady, persistent application to business, aided by sound judgment and\r\npowerful will. In addition to his hardware business, he is interested\r\nwith Mr. Worthington in the Iron and Nail works, and has furnace\r\ninterests in the Mahoning Valley.\r\n\r\nIn all his dealings, commercial or otherwise, he has been strictly\r\nconscientious, and this has secured for him the esteem of all with whom he\r\nhas come in contact, and the respect and confidence of the general public.\r\nHis word is inviolable, and no one has ever uttered a whisper against his\r\nunsullied integrity. In all works of genuine charity, his aid is\r\nefficaciously, though unobtrusively given, whenever required. To the young\r\nmen in his employ, he is as much a father in his care of their interests\r\nand conduct, as he is an employer.\r\n\r\nIn politics, Mr. Bingham has steadily acted with the Republican party, but\r\nhe is in no degree a politician. He has been chosen by the people to\r\nplaces of municipal trust, but always without any desire on his part, and\r\nsolely because those selecting him considered his services would be\r\nvaluable to the city; and whenever selected as a candidate, he has been\r\nelected, the opposing party having full confidence in his ability and\r\nintegrity. In his case, the place invariably sought the man, and not the\r\nman the place; and it has always been with great reluctance, and because\r\nit seemed the good of the people required it, that he consented to hold\r\npublic office. It would be better for the people were there more men like\r\nWilliam Bingham, and sufficient wisdom among political managers to invoke\r\ntheir services on behalf of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Gordon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA history of the leading commercial men of Cleveland, with no mention of\r\nW. J. Gordon, would be not much unlike the play of Hamlet with the part of\r\nthe Danish prince omitted. Few men in the city have occupied so prominent\r\na position in its mercantile history as has Mr. Gordon; but, from a\r\nnatural distaste of public notice of any kind, on the part of Mr. Gordon,\r\nwe are comparatively without data, and obliged to depend upon what we know\r\nof his history in general.\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon was brought up on a New Jersey farm, on which the battle of\r\nMonmouth was fought, and that had remained for generations, and still\r\nis, in the possession of his family. His earliest recollections were of\r\nrural life, its boyish enjoyments and boyish tasks. He obtained a good\r\ncommon school education, such as could be obtained in that neighborhood.\r\nWhilst yet a lad he manifested a strong taste for business pursuits; and\r\nto gratify and develop that taste he was sent to New York, where he\r\nbecame a clerk.\r\n\r\nBut, young as he was, he reasoned that there was a better chance for a\r\nsuccessful struggle in the new West than in the already crowded marts of\r\nthe East, and that for the young man of energy and enterprise, there was\r\nevery prospect of achieving distinction and fortune in assisting to build\r\nup the business of the new western cities. With this impression he bade\r\nadieu to New York in 1838, and started westward on a tour of observation,\r\nhe being then in his twentieth year. He reached Erie without stopping, and\r\nremained there for some time, carefully observing its commercial\r\nfacilities and its prospects for the future. Not altogether satisfied\r\nwith these, he moved farther west, and made his next stay in Cleveland.\r\nHere he speedily became convinced that a great future was before that\r\ncity, and he determined to remain and share in its benefits. A wholesale\r\ngrocery establishment was opened, small at first, as suited his means and\r\nthe limited requirements of the place, but which more than kept pace with\r\nthe progress of the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon believed that to shrewdness and persistence all things are\r\npossible. His constant endeavor was to discover new avenues of trade, or\r\nnew modes of doing business, and then to utilize his discoveries to the\r\nfull extent, by persistent energy and unwearied industry. He was always on\r\nthe alert to find a new customer for his wares, and to discover a cheaper\r\nplace to purchase his stock, or a better way of bringing them home. Whilst\r\nthus securing unusual advantages in supplying himself with goods, Mr.\r\nGordon was losing no opportunity of pushing his business among the buyers.\r\nHis agents were diligently scouring the country, looking up new customers,\r\nand carefully observing the operations of old customers, to ascertain how\r\ntheir trade could best be stimulated and developed, to the mutual profit\r\nof the retailer and the wholesale dealer from whom he obtained his\r\nsupplies. Men of pushing character and large business acquaintance were\r\nsought out and engaged, that they might aid in developing the business of\r\nthe establishment. As these withdrew, to set up in business for\r\nthemselves, others took their place. It is a noticable fact that no house\r\nhas sent out more young men who have achieved success for themselves; and\r\nthat success was undoubtedly in large measure due to the training received\r\nunder Mr. Gordon.\r\n\r\nHe tolerated no sluggards around his establishment. A hard worker himself,\r\nthose around him were stimulated to hard work. He was at the warehouse\r\nwith the earliest clerk and left it with the latest. He demanded\r\nunflagging industry from his employees, but asked no more than he\r\nmanifested himself. It was through this persistent energy that he achieved\r\nsuccess where others might have failed.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gordon's capital had increased to such an extent as to warrant\r\nhis employment of some of the surplus in investment outside of his regular\r\nbusiness, he made some highly profitable operations of this kind. Among\r\nthem was his uniting with some others of like foresight in the purchase of\r\na tract of mineral land on Lake Superior, and the formation of iron mining\r\ncompanies which, though not immediately profitable, eventually yielded an\r\nenormous percentage on the original outlay, and bids fair to be equally\r\nprofitable for many years to come, besides being a source of immense\r\nwealth to the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Mr. Gordon's health failed, and since that time he has paid but\r\nlittle personal attention to business, but by an extended tour to Europe,\r\nit has been in a great measure restored, and being still in the meridian\r\nof life, he has the prospect, unless some mishap occurs, of long enjoying\r\nthe fruits of his far-sighted intelligence and unwearied industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Wick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLemuel Wick, the father of Henry, was among the early settlers of\r\nYoungstown. The Rev. William Wick, his uncle, preached from time to time\r\nas a missionary of the Presbyterian church, in the settlements on the\r\nborder of Pennsylvania and Ohio, as early as 1779. Henry's father was a\r\nmerchant, in whose store be became a clerk at the age of fifteen. At\r\ntwenty-one he engaged in the project of a rolling-mill at Youngstown,\r\nwhich proved successful. In company with a brother, his father's interest\r\nin the store was purchased, and, having a successful future in prospect,\r\nMr. Wick married, about that time, Miss Mary Hine, of Youngstown, whose\r\nfather was a prominent lawyer of that place. In 1848, he became a citizen\r\nof Cleveland, disposing of the rolling mill to Brown, Bonnell & Co., who\r\nhave since become leading iron men of the Mahoning Valley.\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of mercantile business at Cleveland, the banking house\r\nof Wick, Otis & Brownell was formed, and was successfully managed for two\r\nyears, when the brothers Wick purchased the interest of the other\r\npartners, and continued together until 1857, when the firm name was\r\nchanged to Henry & A. H. Wick, father and son, and has thus continued\r\nuntil the present time.\r\n\r\nMr. Wick is a man of more than ordinary business ability, and has,\r\nthroughout his long commercial life, so directed his talent as to preserve\r\nan unsullied character, and enjoy the unlimited confidence of his fellow\r\ncitizens, in addition to a handsome competence. Speculations were always\r\navoided by him, because he believed that, in a young and healthy country\r\nlike this, men may accumulate property fast enough in the legitimate\r\nchannels of trade, coupled with frugality, temperance and industry. Many\r\nof his employees, by following his example, have become eminently\r\nsuccessful in business.\r\n\r\nMr. Wick was born February 28, 1807, and, consequently, is in his\r\nsixty-third year, although he has lost little of the elasticity of his\r\nstep or his business faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Edwards\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm of Edwards, Townsend & Co. now ranks among the leading houses in\r\nthe city, doing an enormous business, and respected everywhere for its\r\nenterprise and integrity. The head of the firm, William Edwards, was born\r\nin Springfield, Massachusetts, June 6, 1831. At the age of fifteen, he\r\nentered mercantile life as a clerk, and remained in that position in\r\nSpringfield six years. In 1852, he came to Cleveland, that year having\r\nbrought many New Englanders here on account of the recent opening of the\r\nrailroads. His first year was spent in clerking for W. J. Gordon, who then\r\nhad by far the most important wholesale grocery establishment in the city.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year Mr. Edwards, having two thousand five hundred\r\ndollars capital, resolved on setting up a jobbing grocery establishment\r\nfor himself, and in company with Mr. Treat, opened a store on Canal\r\nstreet, doing business in a small way, and being their own accountants,\r\nsalesmen and porters. The first year's business footed up sales to the\r\namount of thirty-seven thousand dollars only, but the young firm was not\r\ndiscouraged. The next year opened with brighter prospects. The first\r\nyear's customers were pleased with the firm, and satisfied that they were\r\nhonest, as well as active and energetic, they returned to buy again and\r\nbrought new customers. Orders came in rapidly, and by the middle of the\r\nthird year the sales had grown to the rate of sixty thousand dollars per\r\nyear. At that point, Mr. Edwards purchased the interest of his partner and\r\nlooked about for a new associate in business.\r\n\r\nMr. Hiram Iddings, of Trumbull county, became partner, and with his\r\naccession, the business increased more rapidly than before. Both members\r\nof the firm used every honorable means to push their business, and with\r\nalmost unvarying success. New fields were sought out and the old ones\r\ncarefully canvassed. As before, nearly every new customer became a\r\nconstant purchaser, being thoroughly satisfied with the treatment\r\nreceived, and new customers were added. The territory served widened, and\r\nthe reputation of the house for enterprise and fair dealing spread. In\r\n1862, the sales had grown to two hundred and forty thousand dollars. More\r\naid was necessary to attend to the business of the firm, and on the first\r\nof October, in that year Mr. Amos Townsend was added to the firm, which\r\nthen became Edwards, Iddings & Co. A year from that time Mr. Iddings died,\r\nand on the first of January, 1864, a change was made in the title of the\r\nfirm to Edwards, Townsend & Co., Mr. J. B. Parsons being admitted as the\r\nthird partner. Under that title and organization it still continues.\r\n\r\nThe business of the firm has kept fully abreast with the progress of the\r\ncity. The members are shrewd, enterprising, always on the lookout for new\r\nopenings for trade, and ready to take instant advantage of them. They each\r\nhave a happy faculty of making friends, and still happier faculty of\r\nretaining them. The proof of this is seen in the increasing sales, which\r\nnow amount to one million dollars a year, the customers being scattered\r\nthrough northern Ohio, Pennsylvania, and a portion of Michigan. Their\r\nextensive stores on Water street are constantly busy with customers and\r\nwith the receipt and shipment of goods.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwards has attained prosperity, not by the favor of others, but by\r\nfighting his own battle of life with indomitable perseverance and\r\nimperturbable good humer. He has worked hard and persistently, but at the\r\nsame time acted on the belief that \"care killed a cat,\" and that \"a light\r\nheart makes work light.\" His hearty good humor has had no small share in\r\nattracting and retaining customers, and has at the same time enabled him\r\nto rationally enjoy the prosperity his labors have brought him. But his\r\ngood humor never leads him to abate a jot of his shrewd watchfulness in\r\nbusiness matters, and to his prudence and keen observation are owing the\r\nfact that he has almost wholly escaped litigation. At thirty-eight years\r\nold he takes rank among the foremost and most successful marchants of\r\nCleveland, whilst his frank, hearty manners, his warm friendship, and his\r\nliberal unselfish benevolence which distributes charity with an\r\nunstinting, though intelligent hand, rank Mr. Edwards among the most\r\nvalued and most valuable of citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmos Townsend\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmos Townsend was born near Pittsburgh in 1831, and received a good common\r\nEnglish education. At fifteen years old, he left school and entered a\r\nstore at Pittsburgh, in which he remained three years, and then removed to\r\nMansfield, Ohio, where, young as he was, he set up in business for\r\nhimself, retailing goods, and remaining a citizen of that town during the\r\ngreater part of nine years.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in Mansfield, the Kansas troubles broke out and\r\narrived at such a pitch that a Congressional committee, comprised of\r\nMessrs. John Sherman of Ohio, W. A. Howard of Michigan, and W. A. Oliver\r\nof Missouri, was appointed to proceed to Kansas and investigate the facts\r\nin regard to General Stringfellow's opposition to Governor Reeder's\r\nadministration. Mr. Sherman procured the appointment of Mr. Townsend as\r\nUnited States Marshal, and he accompanied the commission to the scene of\r\ndisturbance. He was on a hill near Lawrence when he saw the _passe\r\ncomitatus_ of the United States Marshal of the Territory batter down the\r\nFree State Hotel, it having been indicted as a nuisance by the Grand Jury.\r\nShortly afterwards, Mr. Townsend was taken prisoner by General\r\nStringfellow, but on ascertaining his position he was released.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, he came to Cleveland, having been engaged by Gordon, McMillan &\r\nCo. In that establishment, he remained nearly five years, and then became\r\npartner in the firm of Edwards, Iddings & Co., which, on the death of Mr.\r\nIddings, became Edwards, Townsend & Co. The operations of that firm have\r\nalready been spoken of.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend has served a full apprenticeship to the business in which he\r\nis now engaged, and is familiar with all its details from the cellar to\r\nthe counting-room. As a skillful financier, he has few superiors, and the\r\nlarge operations of the firm bear evidence to this in the regularity and\r\nsafety with which they are conducted.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, the Republicans of the Third Ward chose him as their candidate\r\nfor member of the City Council, of which he was afterwards chosen\r\npresident. He not only polled the full vote of the party, but drew a large\r\nnumber of Democratic votes, and was elected by a good majority, although\r\nthe ward has generally been considered Democratic, and has retained his\r\nseat to the present time, his personal popularity among all classes,\r\ncombined with the unexceptionable record he made in the Council,\r\novercoming all opposition. At the organization of the new Council for\r\n1869, he was unanimously re-elected president, a fact as complimentary as\r\nit is rare, it being the almost invariable custom for each party to vote\r\nfor its own candidate, even where the result of the election is a foregone\r\nconclusion. He was in the same year suggested as the Republican candidate\r\nfor Mayor, and would undoubtedly have been chosen to that office had he\r\nnot considered it incompatible with proper attention to the large and\r\nrapidly increasing business of his firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Your Friend, D. A. Dangler]\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid A. Dangler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid A. Dangler, like scores of other successful men in Cleveland, is a\r\nconqueror of adverse circumstances. In taking a cursory glance at the\r\nearly history of representative Clevelanders, noticed in this volume, it\r\nwill be readily seen that our business firms are largely composed of men\r\nwho, in early life, were compelled to divide their time between work on\r\nthe farm and attendance at the district school. Much of the debilitating\r\ndissipation common in cities has been escaped by them; and hence, they\r\nhave both sound minds to project, and vigorous bodies to execute.\r\n\r\nMr. Dangler found it necessary, at the early age of seven years, to do\r\nsomething towards carrying on his father's farm in Stark county, Ohio.\r\nDuring the Winter months, he had the benefit of a district school until\r\n1838, when, at the age of fourteen, he was employed in a dry goods store\r\nat Canton, as boy of all work. Here, he won the confidence of his\r\nemployers, and by closely saving his limited wages, was able to attend\r\nschool six months more, which completed his education. With this\r\nexception, he continued to serve in the same store until 1845, when, with\r\na very limited capital, the savings from his wages, he commenced on his\r\nown account, in the same business.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, he left the trade in dry goods and took up that in hardware. The\r\nlate Mr. John Tennis, who was also a Stark county man, and Mr. Dangler, in\r\n1853, formed a partnership for jobbing in this line at Cleveland. The\r\nsuccess of the concern was all that reasonable men could expect. Their\r\nconnection continued until 1867, when it expired by limitation. They were\r\namong the first wholesale firms on Water Street, and this enlarged field\r\nof commercial operations gave full exercise to the talent and energy of\r\nMr. Dangler. Trade was pushed in all directions, and in a remarkably short\r\ntime they succeeded in building up a lucrative business.\r\n\r\nSuccess did not make a miser of Mr. Dangler. On the breaking out of the\r\nrebellion, he entered with all his native enthusiasm into the home duties\r\nof the war. In August, 1862, he took a prominent part in the organization\r\nof ward committees for raising recruits and providing for the familles of\r\nsoldiers. A large part of his time during the war was devoted to this\r\nwork, and will ever be remembered with gratitude by scores of families for\r\ntimely assistance rendered during that trying ordeal. In the Fourth ward,\r\nwhere he lives, there never was a man drafted to fill its quota.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, he was elected a member of the City Council, and in 1865, a\r\nmember of the House of Representatives for Cuyahoga County, by the\r\nRepublican party. These public trusts were so well filled that in 1867, he\r\nwas returned to the Senate, representing the most important commercial\r\ndistrict of the State except one, and at all times being watchful and\r\nactive in the interests of his constituents. Among the important measures\r\noriginated by him in the Legislature, are the Metropolitan Police, State\r\nCharities, State Gas Inspection, and the Building and Loan Association\r\nActs. The last mentioned act has been very extensively taken advantage of\r\namong his immediate constituents. No less than ten societies have been\r\norganized in this city, under it, and have already been productive of much\r\ngood among the laboring class, by enabling them to obtain homesteads on\r\neasy terms. The capital stock of these societies amounts to over three\r\nmillion dollars, and if the act is as highly appreciated throughout the\r\nState as it is here, the benefit accruing therefrom will be almost\r\nincalculable, inasmuch as the monthly payments would, in many cases, be\r\nsquandered; whereas, now, they are not only saved, but secure a share of\r\nthe profits of the association in proportion to the stock held. The\r\nsuccessful working of these institutions must be exceedingly gratifying to\r\nMr. Dangler. He is an active, energetic and impulsive member, though not\r\nwithout considerable tact, and generally successful in putting his\r\nmeasures through. As a speaker he is clear-headed, terse and forcible, and\r\non subjects appealing to patriotism, really eloquent.\r\n\r\nMr. Dangler is liberal with his means, with broad plans, not for himself\r\nalone, but for the public; indeed, we have few men among us more public\r\nspirited than he. To this new element of self-made and successful men, the\r\ncity owes much of the unparalleled development of the few past years.\r\nTheir energy and commercial intelligence have inaugurated a new order of\r\nthings here, placing Cleveland in the front rank of western cities.\r\n\r\nMr. Dangler has recently formed a new partnership, and is again engaged in\r\nthe hardware business, having established the new firm of Dangler &\r\nBowman, on Superior Street. He is still young and vigorous, and has it yet\r\nin his power to accomplish much.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nT. S. Beckwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the mercantile interests of Cleveland as developed by her\r\nprominent operators, it is with pleasure we produce a brief notice of Mr.\r\nT. S. Beckwith, one of our well known and most successful merchants. He\r\nwas born in Lyme, CT, Jan. 11, 1821. Until he was fourteen, he remained\r\non the farm with his father, at which time he commenced clerking in a\r\nstore in Brownville, Jefferson Co., N. Y., and remained four years. He\r\nthen came to Cleveland and at once engaged as a clerk with Alexander\r\nSacket, who was then carrying on business on Superior Street, precisely\r\nwhere Mr. Beckwith's carpet store now stands. After two years with Mr.\r\nSacket, he went as clerk with P. M. Weddell & Co., in which capacity he\r\nserved four years, when he was taken into partnership with P. M. Weddell,\r\nDudley Baldwin and W. E. Beckwith, his brother, and in this firm did\r\nbusiness in the dry goods line for about four years, when he and his\r\nbrother, alone, carried on business several years, and finally Mr. Henry\r\nWick became associated with them and another store was started. Both\r\nstores were continued about four years, when the firm dissolved, and\r\nanother formed under the name of Beckwith, Sterling & Co., composed of T.\r\nS. Beckwith, F. A. Sterling and G. Clayes. This firm was dissolved after\r\ntwo or three years and the subject of this sketch left the dry goods\r\nbusiness and opened the first store for the exclusive sale of carpets in\r\nCleveland. After five or six years, his former partner, F. A. Sterling,\r\nagain became associated with him. The firm of Beckwith & Sterling existed\r\nthree years when they admitted two young men in their employ, O. Baker\r\nand W. R. Havens.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckwith is a thorough business man, quick to form judgment and quick\r\nto act upon it. He is among our best financiers, nearly always makes an\r\ninvestment pay. When he was regularly employed as a salesman, he was hard\r\nto match, and one great secret of his success as such was his courteous\r\ndemeanor to all, whether rich or poor, and an industrious effort to\r\nplease. We recommend those of our young men who desire to succeed in\r\nbusiness to study one of the principal keys to T. S. Beckwith's success--a\r\npolite attention to all. It will pay.\r\n\r\nMr. Beckwith's business has grown with the city, and the profits with it,\r\nand although he has only attained to the meridian of life, and in the full\r\nenjoyment of mental and physical energy, he has acquired a handsome\r\ncompetency.\r\n\r\nBesides his mercantile interest, Mr. B. has aided in giving to Cleveland\r\nthe character of a manufacturing city, having invested largely in the\r\nwhite lead factory of this city, which is under the management of Mr. J.\r\nH. Morley, an account of which will be seen in the Manufacturing\r\nDepartment of this work.\r\n\r\nBusiness has not, however, engrossed the whole of Mr. Beckwith's time and\r\ntalents. He is as thorough a worker in the cause of religion, morality and\r\nbenevolence as in trade. For a number of years, he has been an active\r\nmember of the Second Presbyterian church of this city, always taking a\r\nlively interest in the Sunday school connected with the church. He was\r\nalso as indefatigable in the interests of the Bethel Church and Sunday\r\nschool of this city, and which is now doing a noble work in the city.\r\n\r\nMr. B. was married in 1849, to Miss Sarah Oliphant of Grandville,\r\nWashington Co., N. Y. Two children of this marriage are living and a\r\nthird dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, Elias Sims]\r\n\r\n\r\nElias Sims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Sims has not been strictly a man of commerce among us, his\r\nlife labor has been one wholly devoted to enterprises that are strictly\r\nconducive to that foundation of a commonwealth. Properly placed, he would\r\nbe with general contractors, but as we have not material sufficient for a\r\ndepartment under that head, he must take rank among the men whose trade\r\nhas been facilitated by his enterprise.\r\n\r\nElias Sims was born at Onondaga, New York, August 4. 1818, and is another\r\nstriking instance of the value of early dependence on one's own\r\nresources. Until he was fifteen years of age, Elias worked on a farm,\r\nwhen he concluded to leave it, and strike out for himself on another\r\nline. He worked as a laborer on the New York canal for some time, and\r\nbeing a lad of great force of character with a keen eye to business, he\r\nwas very soon selected as an overseer. He held this situation for about\r\ntwo years when he became deputy superintendent of the works, being at the\r\ntime only in his eighteenth year. After considerable experience in this\r\nbusiness, he concluded there was an opportunity to make more money by\r\ncontracting than by working on a salary, and consequently resigned his\r\noffice and commenced on a work for which he was eminently adapted by\r\nnature, and one in which he subsequently became remarkably successful,\r\nas, indeed, was his first contract, for it resulted in a profit of\r\nseveral thousand dollars. Men did not become millionaires in such short\r\norder then as now, and so much money so easily obtained almost unbalanced\r\nthe young contractor. It made him less careful in his estimates, and, as\r\nmay be easily judged, his next job swallowed the whole of his capital,\r\nand compelled him to become overseer again.\r\n\r\nThe next speculation he engaged in was the building of a tug, in\r\nconnection with two others, and which proved a success. After some time,\r\nhe obtained a dredging contract at Port Stanley, Canada, and being very\r\nsuccessful in this he entered into it as a permanent business, and\r\nappeared among the live men of Cleveland in 1856, as a contractor for\r\ndredging the \"old river bed\". From year to year, this contract for\r\ndredging at Cleveland has been continued, and in addition to this, he has\r\nexecuted some immense jobs at Grand Haven, Mich., Erie, Pa., and\r\nMilwaukee, Wis., in which he has been uniformly successful. He also\r\ncontracted largely in the construction of the Great Western Rail Road, in\r\nCanada, and canal locks in Iowa. He is interested in propellers on the\r\nlakes, and has two tugs and three dredges in this harbor.\r\n\r\nMr. Sims may well be styled a pioneer in the system of dredging, by means\r\nof which all the lake harbors have been able to receive vessels of double\r\nthe old tonnage. Although of a quiet, he is not by any means of an\r\nindolent temperament, and has exhibited business energy in a way that did\r\nnot make much noise, but which led to sure results. Mr. Sims was one of\r\nthe contractors and one of the proprietors of the Rocky River Rail Road\r\nand Hotel. He is also interested in the People's Gas Company of the West\r\nSide, and we are driven to the conclusion that such a long series of\r\nsuccesses in such undertakings cannot be due to accident; there must be\r\nfor foundation, a clear, calculating mind, and the ability to execute well\r\nwhat is well planned. Projects in which others had failed became\r\nprofitable under his management. He is still in the vigor of life going on\r\nas usual with his contracts.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Mr. Sims married Miss Fosburgh, of Onondaga Co., N. Y.; of the\r\nmarriage three children were born, Mrs. Sloane of Buffalo, Mrs. Evatt of\r\nCleveland, deceased, and Mrs. Wm. Starkweather of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Perkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most noticeable mansions on the north side of Euclid Avenue is\r\nthe tasteful and substantial stone building a little west of Sterling\r\nAvenue, which, from its general style of architecture and its handsome\r\nsurroundings of lawn and shrubberies, resembles the comfortable country\r\nhome of a family of wealth and taste in England. This is the residence of\r\nJoseph Perkins, and in its neat, home-like beauty, gives at once a good\r\nidea of the character of its owner, and a perpetual invitation to repose.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins was born July 5, 1819, in Warren, Ohio, his father being Simon\r\nPerkins of that place. His educational advantages were food, and after\r\nleaving school he entered his father's office. Born to comfortable\r\ncircumstances he never had occasion to struggle for an existence as have\r\nso many of the now wealthy citizens of Cleveland, but, on the other hand,\r\nthe acquisition of riches without hard labor for it did not, as in so many\r\nother cases, prove his ruin, nor did he spend his days in idleness. On his\r\nfather's death, he was one of his executors and gave his whole attention\r\nto the task of closing up the estate. That duty performed, he came to\r\nCleveland and found abundant occupation in managing his own estate and in\r\nexecuting the duties devolving upon him through his appointments to places\r\nof trust in banks, railroads, and other organizations. For several years,\r\nhe was a director of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad Company and took\r\nan active part in its affairs. On the death of Governor Tod, he was chosen\r\npresident of the company, a position he still retains and the duties of\r\nwhich he performs with scrupulous fidelity. He is also president of the\r\nSecond National Bank. During the building of the Euclid Street\r\nPresbyterian Church, he was a member of the building committee, and has\r\ntaken an active interest in the affairs of that church for many years. He\r\nwas also a member of the building committee of the Savings Bank Society\r\nand of the building committee of the National Bank Building.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, Mr. Perkins united with the Presbyterian Church, of which he has\r\nsince remained an active and influential member, the scene of his\r\nprofession being in Marietta, where he listened to the teachings of the\r\nRev. Mr. Bingham.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1840, he married Miss Martha E. Steele, of Marietta, by whom\r\nhe has had six children, four of whom still survive.\r\n\r\nMr. Perkins is a man of no ordinary character, and it is unfortunate for\r\nthe world that there are so few of his mould in comparison with the whole\r\nnumber of people. The governing principle of his life is religion, his\r\nactions are directed by his conscience. Although rich and controlling large\r\nmeans, he is utterly free from the sin of avarice, and, though fully\r\nappreciating the value of money, he respects it mainly for the power of\r\ndoing good it gives the possessor. His liberality is great, but is guided\r\nby a wise caution instead of being squandered indiscriminately. He\r\ndislikes being imposed upon by unworthy petitioners, and therefore\r\nnarrowly investigates alleged cases of distress before relieving them.\r\nWhen satisfied that the object is worthy, his aid is generous and\r\nungrudging. His ear is ever open to the tale of distress, his hand ever\r\nopen when the distress is found to be real instead of simulated to impose\r\nupon the charitable. He has been known to leave his mails untouched all\r\nday that he might trace out and relieve cases of genuine affliction or\r\nsuffering. His time and best judgment are given to the widow and\r\nfatherless, nor is his counsel empty-handed. In business matters, the rule\r\nof his life is not to claim the lion's share, although furnishing the\r\nmeans for an enterprise, but to deal with others as he would have done by\r\nhim under similar circumstances. He believes that by pursuing this policy,\r\nhe has reaped greater material advantages than if he had pursued a\r\ngrasping policy, whilst his conscience is the easier for his forbearance.\r\nHis firm determination to do right in every transaction and under all\r\ncircumstances has in his case given fresh proof of the truth of the adage\r\nthat \"honesty is the best policy.\"\r\n\r\nNor, though among the wealthy of the city, is he an aristocrat in feeling.\r\nTo him, the poor soldier's widow, the laborer's wife, and the wife of the\r\nmillionaire are equal in their claims upon his courtesy and his attention.\r\nHe is in feeling one of the people, yet utterly innocent of the arts of\r\nthe demagogue, and repudiating with firmness any attempt to bring him\r\nforward into political life, against the heats and confusion of which his\r\nmodest and quiet character revolts.\r\n\r\nAlthough not of robust health, he is enabled to get through a large amount\r\nof work by methodical habits and by a strict avoidance of injurious haste\r\nand worry. His leisure is spent in the enjoyments of his beautiful home\r\nand in the cultivation of a fine artistic taste which has been developed\r\nand gratified by a tour among the principal art centers of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHinman B. Hurlbut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHimnan B. Hurlbut, a lineal descendant of Governor Hinman, of Connecticut,\r\nwas born in St. Lawrence County, New York, July 29, 1818. In his boyhood,\r\nhe received such education as the common schools provided, and the time\r\nnot spent in the school room was employed on his father's farm, he being\r\nthe youngest of a large family and required to help along with the others.\r\n\r\nAt the age of fifteen, he left the farm and engaged as clerk in the\r\nmercantile business in Washington, St. Lawrence County, where he remained\r\nabout three years.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, he removed to Cleveland and commenced the study of law with his\r\nbrother, H. A. Hurlbut, then practicing law here. On August 7th, 1839, he\r\nwas admitted to practice, and at once went to Massillon, Stark county,\r\nwhere he opened an office for the practice of his profession. His cash\r\ncapital when he started for his prospective field of labor, consisted of\r\nthree dollars and twenty-five cents. The disbursement of this sum was as\r\nfollows: three dollars for his packet fare to Massillon; twenty-five cents\r\nfor three sheets of paper and two packets of tobacco. His worldly goods\r\nwere all contained in a hair trunk; the most valuable item of which was\r\nhis law library, comprising two volumes, Blackstone and Kent's\r\nCommentaries. Our readers may well be assured that Mr. Hurlbut was\r\ndreadfully in earnest about that time to commence business. He soon\r\nsucceeded in making a commencement; his talent and industry were rewarded\r\nby one of the largest and most lucrative practices in that section,\r\nextending through Wayne, Holmes, Tuscarawas, Carroll, Columbiana, and\r\nSummit counties. As a lawyer he was very successful. He continued the\r\npractice of his profession until 1850, four years of which time he was the\r\nlaw partner of Hon. D. K. Cartter.\r\n\r\nSome three years before retiring from his law practice, he became\r\ninterested in banking at Massillon, and in 1850, organized the Merchants\r\nBank, of Massillon, with a capital of $100,000. This was in connection\r\nwith Dr. I. Steese, who is still president of the bank, with the capital\r\nincreased to $200,000. It was and is a very successful enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, still retaining most of his interest in the bank at Massillon, he\r\ncame to Cleveland, and commenced a private banking business, under the\r\nfirm name of Hurlbut & Go., under the American House, and continuing about\r\none year, when he purchased from the directors of the Merchants Bank the\r\ncharter of the Bank of Commerce, and at once commenced business under it,\r\nwith Mr. Parker Handy as president, and himself as cashier. About a year\r\nafterwards Mr. Handy resigned, and Mr. Joseph Berkins became president.\r\nThe stock was increased from time to time till it reached $250,000, and\r\nthen reorganized under the name of the Second National Bank of Cleveland,\r\nwith the same officers, and nearly the same board, with a capital stock of\r\n$600,000, and its success may be judged when we say that it has a reserve\r\nfund of over $400,000, and it may well be characterized as one of the\r\nstrongest, if not the strongest bank in Ohio.\r\n\r\nMr. Hurlbut was cashier from the commencement, and labored assiduously in\r\nits interests, so that the Second National Bank of Cleveland is eminently\r\nthe fruit of his labor and skill. Mr. Hurlbut was obliged to resign his\r\nposition January 1, 1866, on account of failing health, induced by\r\nexcessive mental application, and was succeeded by the assistant cashier,\r\nJ. O. Buell, who still retains the office. On resigning, he was made vice\r\npresident, which position he still retains. He took a trip to Europe,\r\nwhere he remained two years, returning much improved.\r\n\r\nBesides his official duties here, in 1864, in connection with Messrs. J.\r\nPerkins, A. Stone and S. Witt, he purchased of the Board of Control, the\r\ncharter of the Toledo Branch of the State Bank of Ohio, which also proved\r\na great success, paying in the neighborhood of twenty-five percent per\r\nannum. It was reorganized under the National Bank Law. Mr. Hurlbut held no\r\nofficial position in this bank, but assisted in its management.\r\n\r\nFor some years, he has been a director of the Bellefontaine Railroad\r\nCompany, and on the consolidation of that company with the Cleveland,\r\nColumbus and Cincinnati Railroad Company, was made a director of the\r\nconsolidated line. He has added to his interests in banks and railroads\r\nsome important investments in the iron interests of the city, and through\r\nhis shrewd observation and extensive business knowledge, has managed to\r\nmake his investments profitable. For fifteen years, he was a member of the\r\nState Board of Control of the State Bank of Ohio. From the organization of\r\nthe Protestant General Hospital of Cleveland, he has been its president.\r\n\r\nMr. Hurlbut's sole official connection with politics was his serving as a\r\ndelegate from the Seventeenth Ohio District in the Philadelphia Convention\r\nthat nominated General Taylor. He is in no degree a politician, but always\r\ntakes an active interest as a private citizen and voter, in the discussion\r\nof political questions. His tastes are elegant and refined, and since his\r\nvirtual retirement from the pressing duties of business, he has found\r\nenjoyment in the cultivation of those tastes. His manners are affable and\r\ngenial, his disposition frank and generous. In business matters, he has\r\nalways been prompt, and has never allowed his engagements to lie\r\nunfulfilled or be postponed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Yours truly, E. I. Baldwin\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nElbert Irving Baldwin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dry goods establishment of E. I. Baldwin & Co. is one of the best\r\nknown business houses of Cleveland. Its reputation extends widely beyond\r\nthe limits of the city, and throughout a large portion of the State it is\r\nknown as one of the places to be visited whenever a shopping excursion is\r\nmade to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nElbert Irving Baldwin, the founder and head of the firm, was born in New\r\nHaven, Connecticut, May 13, 1829. He received excellent early educational\r\nadvantages, in preparation for a literary life, but as his health was not\r\nequal to this, he turned his attention to mercantile pursuits, when about\r\neighteen years of age, by engaging as clerk in the dry goods house of\r\nSandford & Allen, in his native town. With the firm he remained several\r\nyears, and then engaged for about two years with a dry goods firm in New\r\nYork city.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1853, Mr. Baldwin came to Cleveland, and on the completion of\r\nNorthrup & Spangler's Block, commenced the retail branch of the dry goods\r\nbusiness, his father, S. I. Baldwin, being a partner in the business for\r\nthe first three years. Mr. Baldwin opened out with a stock of goods\r\ncosting sixteen thousand dollars, and at the close of the first year had\r\nmade sales to the amount of forty-three thousand dollars. This was an\r\nencouraging result for those times, and he correctly judged that it was\r\nbut the foundation of a large and lucrative business. Each succeeding\r\nyear, without any exception, has brought an increase of business, till the\r\nannual sales of the firm are in the vicinity of a million dollars, which,\r\nin a retail business, in a city of Cleveland's size, is very large; and\r\nfairly entitles him to be regarded as the most successful dry goods\r\nmerchant Cleveland has ever had. Having from the first conducted business\r\nin a strictly honorable manner, selling only good articles at reasonable\r\nprofits, and allowing no misrepresentations, the result is, that many of\r\nthe customers of the house are of fifteen years' continuance. This, in\r\nconjunction with the natural growth of the trade growing out of an\r\nincrease in the population, now gives his house the appearance of a\r\ncentral dry goods market.\r\n\r\nBesides endeavoring to deal faithfully with customers, he inaugurated the\r\none price and cash system of trade, so as to be faithful to himself and\r\nhis creditors, and the result of all is--immense success.\r\n\r\nTo meet the demands of trade, in 1868, his firm purchased a piece of land\r\nwhereon stood part of the well known City Buildings, on Superior street,\r\nand erected the elegant store now occupied by them, at an expense of over\r\none hundred thousand dollars. It has been selected by us as a symbolic\r\ntitle page, representing Cleveland present, and is at once an ornament to\r\nthe city, and a monument to untiring industry and integrity. The building\r\nhas a frontage of forty-two and a half feet, a depth of one hundred and\r\nfifty feet, and a height of eighty feet, overtopping all the blocks in the\r\ncity. The front is of Amherst sandstone. The building is divided into five\r\nstories, with a basement; the ground floor, occupied by the store, having\r\nfive hundred feet of counter-room. Without, the architectural taste\r\ndisplayed was unexceptionably good, the building having an appearance of\r\nlightness and elegance, whilst at the same time conveying an idea of\r\nstrength and solidity. The store is fitted up in the most sumptuous\r\nmanner, and is of itself an attraction to visitors, to say nothing of the\r\nrich wares always there displayed.\r\n\r\nOn the retirement of his father, Mr. Baldwin associated with himself his\r\nbrother-in-law, H. R. Hatch, and in 1863, Mr. W. S. Tyler, an employee, was\r\nadmitted to an interest in the business, and in 1866, Mr. G. C. F. Hayne,\r\nanother employee, became a partner. This is an excellent custom, and we\r\nare glad to see so many of our heavy merchants acknowledging the integrity\r\nand ability of their clerks in the same way.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin has now the general superintendence of the whole business;\r\nand, although he is not, nor ever has been, physically strong, is very\r\nactive, and there is little that escapes his observation.\r\n\r\nHe was married, August, 1855, to Miss Mary Janette Sterling, of Lima,\r\nLivingston county, New York. The fruits of the marriage were three\r\nchildren now living, and one daughter who died.\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin has been connected with the Second Presbyterian church about\r\nthirteen years, and has taken an active interest in the Sunday school. He\r\nwas trustee of the church for several years, and has always been found\r\nready to aid in the furtherance of every good work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, G. N. Abbey]\r\n\r\n\r\nGrove N. Abbey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trade in stoneware is a very important branch of the business of\r\nCleveland, and this lies in the hands of one firm, of which Grove N. Abbey\r\nis the leading member. As the West generally is supplied from the parent\r\nhouse of the Abbeys, or from one or other of the branch establishments\r\nthrough the West, in which Mr. Abbey holds an interest, it would be\r\nmanifestly out of place to omit, in a work of this character, a reference\r\nto him and his operations.\r\n\r\nMr. Abbey was born in Portland, Connecticut, August 19th, 1818. He was the\r\neleventh of a family of thirteen, of whom seven yet live. The father,\r\nAsaph, died at the age of fifty-five. The mother, Ruth Hollister, survived\r\nher husband thirty years, the last twenty-two of which were spent in the\r\nfamily of her son Grove N., and died February 20th, 1868, at the advanced\r\nage of eighty-six. As before said, she had thirteen children, twelve of\r\nwhom married, and thus enabled her to remark, as she repeatedly did, that\r\nshe had had twenty-four children. Before her death she had seventy-one\r\ngrandchildren added to the list of her descendants, besides fifty-seven\r\ngreat-grandchildren, and one of the fourth generation, making in all one\r\nhundred and forty-two descendants.\r\n\r\nAt the age of sixteen, G. N. Abbey bade adieu to his New England home and\r\nset out for the West. A good portion of his first year after leaving home\r\nwas spent in Pittsburgh, which he then left for Ohio, where he has since\r\nresided; twenty-one years in Akron, and the remainder of the time in\r\nCleveland. His first experience in Akron was as a clerk, from which he\r\nrose to the position of merchant on his own account, carrying on business\r\nuntil 1856. In the Spring of the preceding year he commenced business on\r\nRiver street, Cleveland, in the sale of Akron stoneware, in which he had\r\nbecome interested, and in 1856, removed his family to Cleveland, where he\r\nhas since that time resided, retaining his mercantile interests in Akron\r\nuntil 1858.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Abbey was carrying on a mercantile business in Akron, his\r\nattention was called to the growing importance of the manufacture and\r\ntrade in stoneware, made from the clay of the Springfield clay-bed, which\r\nhas since become famous for the superior quality of stoneware made from\r\nit. The pioneer in the business was David Abbey, a brother of Grove, who\r\ndied in Chicago, in 1856. The extension of railways to Akron rapidly\r\ndeveloped the trade in stoneware, and the Abbey family turned their\r\nexclusive attention to it. The trade grew to importance wherever the\r\narticles found their way. To obtain greater facilities for sale and\r\ndistribution, Mr. Grove N. Abbey came to Cleveland and obtained storage\r\nprivileges in a warehouse on River street, at the foot of St. Clair hill.\r\nSoon the increase of business justified the engagement of the whole\r\nbuilding, and from that time the growth of the trade has been rapid and\r\npermanent. Brandi houses were established in Chicago, Indianapolis, and\r\nSt. Louis, and the parent houses in Akron and Cleveland have been kept\r\nbusy in supplying the needs of these branches as well as of their own. The\r\ncharacter of the article dealt in became known throughout the West, and\r\nwherever introduced the trade soon increased in importance. The result has\r\nbeen a gratifying success to the Abbeys, and the addition of a large\r\nrevenue to the county of Summit.\r\n\r\nIn all their various ramifications of business, Mr. Abbey has occupied an\r\nimportant position. In addition to providing for the home trade, he has\r\nexercised constant personal supervision over the supplying of the western\r\nbranches. The negotiations between dealers and manufacturers have mostly\r\nbeen managed by him, and the importance of these negotiations may be\r\njudged from the fact that the requirements of the customers of Abbey & Co.\r\nregulate the amount of stoneware manufactured in Summit county, and thus\r\naffect the business and revenues of the county.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Cleveland house of G. N. Abbey & Co. has gradually\r\nbeen increased by the introduction of other articles of a kindred nature,\r\nsuch as the brown and yellow ware, manufactured at East Liverpool, Ohio,\r\nglassware from Pittsburgh and New York, and fire-brick and fire-clay. The\r\nposition of Cleveland renders it the natural distributing point for those\r\nwares, and the extensive facilities possessed by Mr. Abbey, and his long\r\nexperience in the business, place the monopoly of the trade in his hands.\r\nThat nothing but good has grown out of this virtual monopoly, is seen in\r\nthe fact that the business is steadily increasing, that no dissatisfaction\r\nis expressed by the customers, and that no litigations have taken place\r\nduring the long business career of the house, extending over a hundred\r\nyears in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nDuring the last six years the firm has had some interest in vessels on the\r\nlakes, and these interests have been carefully watched by Mr. Abbey, who\r\nhas entire control.\r\n\r\nIt will be rightly inferred from what has already been said, that Mr.\r\nAbbey has achieved success in business. That success is due to no lucky\r\naccident or extraneous circumstances, but is the natural result of devoted\r\nattachment to business, keen insight, and a determination to follow, as\r\nfar as practicable, the golden rule of doing as you would be done by, and\r\nof a desire to avoid all misunderstandings.\r\n\r\nIf there be one business faculty more than another, prominent in Mr.\r\nAbbey, it is that of ability to do a large business, on a small capital;\r\nhaving, like nearly all of our merchants, commenced business with nothing\r\nthat his own hands had not earned, and passing through all the trials\r\nincident to mercantile life in a young country, he has become an excellent\r\nfinancier. Naturally of a genial temperament, and inclined to look on the\r\nbright side of things, he glides over reverses and difficulties easier\r\nthan some people, yet he has always keenly felt, and often deplored, the\r\nwant of such early advantages as children of the present day possess.\r\n\r\nBeing early interested in the cause of temperance, he has persistently\r\nendeavored to spread its beneficial effects by means of temperance\r\norganizations, and in April, 1869, he was nominated as temperance\r\ncandidate for Mayor on the first strictly temperance municipal ticket ever\r\nput in nomination in Cleveland. The result was the polling of a temperance\r\nvote of about ten per cent, of the whole vote cast.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven years since, whilst in business at Akron, he was induced to\r\nmake a profession of faith and be received into the Congregational church.\r\nThe faith then professed has never been renounced, and he is now an active\r\nmember of Plymouth Congregational church in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nOn November 4th, 1844, Mr. Abbey married Miss Sarah Goodale, of Kent,\r\nOhio, but who came originally from Massachusetts. Of this marriage there\r\nwere four children, three of whom are still living; the oldest being\r\nmarried to Charles H. White, of Chicago, Illinois. The other daughter and\r\na son remain with the family at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. W. Jenness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Jenness was born in Deerfield, New Hampshire, July 14, 1806, received\r\na good academical education and in 1823 removed from Deerfield to\r\nStrafford, in the same State, where he engaged in merchandizing,\r\ncontinuing in that occupation for thirty years, and finding it reasonably\r\nremunerative. In addition to keeping his store he filled the position of\r\npostmaster of the town for fifteen years, being appointed under several\r\nsuccessive administrations. He represented the town in the lower branch\r\nof the State Legislature, and held the office of High Sheriff for over\r\nfive years, the county which he officiated in having since been carved\r\nout into several counties. On leaving that office he became Probate\r\nJudge, which position he retained five years and then resigned, although\r\nthe terms of office were such that he could have retained his position\r\nuntil he was seventy years of age. He was nominated by the Breckenridge\r\nparty for Governor of the State, but declined. In 1845-6, he was\r\nappointed to the Senate of the United States, to fill out the unexpired\r\nterm of the Hon. Levi Woodbury, who was appointed to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States. In 1850, he was a member of the Constitutional\r\nConvention to revise the constitution of New Hampshire, after which he\r\nretired to private life, and has allowed politics to take their own\r\ncourse without his aid.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenness came to Cleveland seven years ago, but immediately after his\r\narrival started into the lumber business here with vigor, and has followed\r\nit up in the same way, until now he has become so intimately connected\r\nwith Cleveland commerce that he seems like an old settler who has grown up\r\nwith the city. He superintended the whole business here from the first,\r\nwhilst his partners attended to the manufacturing department at their\r\nmills in Michigan, until May 1st, 1869, when Mr. Jenness bought out their\r\nentire interests. He has succeeded in building up a business equal to the\r\nbest in that line in the short space of seven years, which speaks well for\r\nthe energy and business ability displayed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his lumber business Mr. Jenness, in connection with three\r\nothers, built the propeller B. W. Jenness, for carrying lumber and trading\r\nfrom Buffalo to Chicago and intermediate ports. She carries about 330,000\r\nfeet of lumber, and cost $50,000. He has also been part owner of several\r\nother vessels since he has resided here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Truly Yours B. W. Jenness?]\r\n\r\nMr. Jenness is a man of the most active temperament, he no sooner decides\r\nthat a thing has to be done than he does it with all his might. One may\r\nform an idea of him by seeing him write his name; as quick as the pen\r\ntouches the paper it is off like a flash of lightning, with the signature\r\ncomplete. He is broad and powerfully built, and to all appearance can\r\nendure as much as most men, although sixty-three years of age. Like other\r\nsuccessful men, he attributes his success to strict attention to business\r\nin person. In politics he has always been a Democrat. In religion he is\r\nvery liberal, favoring Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and\r\nUnitarians when occasion serves. He is held in esteem by all who know him,\r\nand we trust he may have many years of usefulness before him.\r\n\r\nMr. Jenness was married in 1827 to Miss Nancy Shackford, of Strafford,\r\nNew Hampshire, whom it was his misfortune to lose in May, 1868, leaving\r\ntwo daughters the sole survivors of a family of five, the three sons\r\nbeing dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Fletcher Warner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late J. F. Warner was a native of Burlington, Vermont, on the border of\r\nLake Champlain. His parents were poor, and his early advantages were\r\nlimited. At an early age he became a sort of cabin boy on one of the Lake\r\nChamplain steamers. Mr. Warner came to Cleveland in 1833 or 1834, and went\r\ninto the employ of Wellman, Winch & Co., who then kept a warehouse near\r\nthe present site of the Erie elevator. Mr. Warner often related to his\r\nfriends with much glee, a little incident that occurred in connection with\r\nhis engagement to labor for this firm. It appears that it was represented\r\nto him that he was desired to travel for the house; and he, with visions\r\nof a span of white horses, elegant outfit, and an easy time, readily\r\naccepted the proposition to travel for them. But his bright expectations\r\nwere soon clouded; his horse was shown him and his course of travel was\r\nthe circle around a horse power used for elevating grain from vessels,\r\nprior to the erection of any steam grain elevators in the city. He saw he\r\nhad been the victim of a practical joke, and commenced his travel with as\r\ngood a grace as possible, under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nMr. Warner remained with this firm for about two years, and then became\r\nwarehouseman for Ransom, Baldwin & Co., which was composed of John G.\r\nRansom, now residing in Hamilton, Canada, Stephen A. Baldwin, deceased,\r\nCharles M. Giddings, deceased, and William H. Bruce, then residing at\r\nGreen Bay, and, we believe, now deceased. In 1838 or 1839, this firm was\r\ndissolved, and merged into Ransom, McNair & Co. Mathew McNair, Jr., the\r\njunior partner of this firm, whom the older residents will recollect, is\r\nnow residing in California. Mr. Warner continued with this firm until\r\nthey retired from business, and then he formed a business connection with\r\nAugustus Handy and Ralph H. Harmon. We do not know whether it was prior\r\nor subsequent to this partnership that he lived for a year or two at\r\nTonawanda, but are under the impression that it was prior; but at the\r\ntime of the Tonawanda speculation, gotten up by Clevelanders, he was\r\ninduced to go there.\r\n\r\nAfter about two or three years, the firm with which Mr. Warner was\r\nconnected, moved to Chicago, but being all Clevelanders, and Chicago not\r\nbeing congenial to them, the firm soon dissolved, and the members of it\r\nmoved back to Cleveland, since which time Mr. Warner was employed in no\r\nactive business. At intervals he had made investments that proved\r\nprofitable, and not being in very robust health, had but little\r\nambition, and lived in comparative retirement. He was one of those who\r\nloved to talk over old times, and never forgot old faces. He was as\r\ncharitable as his means would permit towards worthy objects, and\r\npreserved through all his business relations a character for strict\r\nintegrity. He was a man of strong friendships, frank in his avowals, and\r\nleft a circle of business and social friends who will remember him as an\r\nupright, warm-hearted, and public spirited man, who lived in good\r\nreport, and died sincerely lamented.\r\n\r\nFor many years Mr. Warner had been more or less an invalid, though not\r\noften confined to his house, with Bright's disease of the kidneys. In\r\nNovember, 1868, it assumed a more serious phase, and on December 19th,\r\n1868, terminated his life. About eight months previously, he suffered the\r\nloss of his beloved wife, while spending the colder months in Florida,\r\nwhich had a very depressing effect upon him, and took from him a very\r\nnecessary incentive to life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. V. Cannon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of July, 1867, died, after a very short illness, A. V. Cannon,\r\none of the most promising of the young business men of Cleveland, beloved\r\nby his intimate associates, and esteemed by the whole business community\r\nbrought in contact with him, and thus able to learn his worth.\r\n\r\nMr. Cannon was a native of the Western Reserve, having been born in\r\nStreetsboro', Portage county, in 1834. On leaving school he entered the\r\nstore of Babcock & Hurd, in Aurora, in that county, and when those\r\ngentleman removed to Cleveland he accompanied them and remained in their\r\nestablishment some time, making a twelve years' stay with them altogether.\r\n\r\nHe then went into the produce and commission business, and one year later\r\nformed a partnership with Mr. J. F. Freeman, which existed until dissolved\r\nby death. For two years before his death his health had been impaired, and\r\nhe had been confined to his house for about eighteen months with an\r\naffection of the leg, but had recovered sufficiently to attend to\r\nbusiness, and was in a fair way of perfect recovery. As a relaxation from\r\nbusiness, he visited some friends in the West. On his return he was seized\r\nwith inflammation of the bowels and died after a very brief illness.\r\n\r\nMr. Cannon was one of the kindest of men, universally respected in\r\nbusiness circles for his integrity and probity, and in the social circle\r\nfor his mild and gentle manners and Christian spirit. He died at the early\r\nage of thirty-three, without an enemy, and with the confidence, the esteem\r\nand the love of all who knew him. On the announcement of his death the\r\nBoard of Trade passed resolutions of respect and sorrow, paying high\r\ntributes to his business, social, and Christian qualities. He was buried\r\nwith full Masonic honors, being a valued member of that order.\r\n\r\nMr. Cannon was married June 8th, 1863, to Mary, daughter of the late David\r\nMorris, and left one child, a daughter, now five years of age, very bright\r\nand promising.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Board of Trade, the announcement of Mr. Cannon's\r\ndeath was made by Mr. H. S. Davis, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n  It is with feelings of profound sorrow that I announce the decease of\r\n  A. V. Cannon, Esq., a much respected member of this Board. He has been\r\n  stricken down suddenly, in the hour of his manhood, and in the midst of\r\n  his usefulness. I have known Mr. Cannon from his early manhood, and can\r\n  bear testimony to his untiring industry, strict integrity, and the\r\n  purity of his character in all the relations of life. He was earnest in\r\n  business, pleasant and affable in his demeanor, beloved by all who knew\r\n  him, and it is not too much to say that in his death the Board has met\r\n  with an irreparable loss.\r\n\r\n  We cannot lose such men without feeling that it comes very close to\r\n  ourselves, and let us pause in the midst of our daily avocations to pay\r\n  our parting respects to the memory of one who, were he living, would be\r\n  first to recognize it as being due to others, and I would therefore\r\n  suggest to the meinbers of this Board, that so far as possible they\r\n  attend his funeral.\r\n\r\nMr. R. T. Lyon offered the following resolutions, which were\r\nunanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we learn with much regret and sorrow the death of our\r\n  esteemed friend and member of this Board of Trade, Mr. A. V. Cannon,\r\n  noted for his modesty, honesty, business qualifications, strict\r\n  integrity and moral principles, and worthy of the imitation of us all;\r\n  and in these manifestations of our respect and regard we sympathise with\r\n  the family and friends of the deceased in their sorrow and affliction.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we will make it our duty to attend the funeral of the\r\n  deceased at the appointed time.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the daily session of this Board be suspended on the day\r\n  of the funeral of the deceased.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That a copy of the above resolutions be transmitted to the\r\n  family of the deceased, by the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nH. F. Brayton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be a business man in Cleveland without an enemy, we think it must\r\nbe H. F. Brayton. He has been connected with various branches of business\r\nin this city for thirty-three years, and enjoyed to an unusual degree the\r\nconfidence of his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nH. F. Brayton was born in Jefferson county, New York, November 22, 1812.\r\nHe obtained a good academical education, and at the age of eighteen went\r\nto New York city and engaged as a clerk in a dry goods store, where he\r\nremained six years. During that time he became secretary of the first\r\ntotal abstinence society ever organized in that city. He was also\r\ntreasurer of the Young Men's Anti-Slavery Society in that city, so far\r\nback as 1834, when Abolition doctrines were very unpopular. He it was that\r\nengaged the noted Theodore D. Weld and sent him out to the Western Reserve\r\nto lecture on the subject, and who succeeded in a very marked degree in\r\nbringing the masses over on to Abolition ground, and from which, in this\r\nsection, they never receded until every bondman's fetter was broken. John\r\nJay, our present minister to Austria, was, at the same time, one of the\r\ndirectors of the Society. He also connected himself with the Liberty\r\nparty, being associated with Salmon P. Chase, in its early history. He\r\nnext glided into the Free Soil party, and from that to the Republican.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, Mr. Brayton left New York and came to Cleveland, and very soon\r\nbecame book-keeper of the old Bank of Cleveland, and remained in the same\r\nposition three years. He then went to Columbus and became cashier of a\r\nbank. After one year he resigned and came back to Cleveland, where he\r\nengaged in private banking, and continued the same for about ten years.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Mr. Brayton became the first agent of the Continental Insurance\r\nCompany, in this city, and still retains the office. This has been one of\r\nthe most successful companies in the country. He is also the agent of the\r\nWashington Insurance Company, and the peculiarity of the two companies is,\r\nthat the assured participate in the profits.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1869, his son, H. G. Brayton, became interested in his\r\nfather's business, under the firm name of H. F. Brayton & Son. H. F.\r\nBrayton is also a partner in another insurance agency in the city. About\r\nsix years since he went to New York and took charge of the agency\r\ndepartment of the Columbia Insurance Company, and continued in the\r\ndischarge of the duties of the office for one year, when the agency\r\nbusiness was discontinued in that company, and Mr. Brayton accepted a like\r\nsituation in the Resolute Insurance Company, where he remained about two\r\nyears, and then returned to Cleveland, where his business had been carried\r\non as usual during the three years of his absence.\r\n\r\nMr. Brayton has not devoted his entire attention to banking and insurance\r\nsince his residence in Cleveland. From 1854 to 1857, he was connected with\r\nthe firm of I. C. Pendleton & Co. in the coal trade, and previous to this\r\nhe was the secretary of the Ohio Coal Company, which dealt principally in\r\nPittsburgh coal for gas purposes. He is also at present engaged in the\r\nforeign passenger and real estate business.\r\n\r\nMr. Brayton was for a number of years president of the Cleveland Board\r\nof Underwriters, but resigned on leaving the city for New York, as\r\nalready narrated.\r\n\r\nOn coming to Cleveland Mr. Brayton united with the First Presbyterian\r\nchurch, and has continued his connection with that denomination in the\r\nvarious societies in the city until the present time, and has been a\r\nworthy and consistent member.\r\n\r\nThe first impression a stranger receives of H. F. Brayton is, that he is a\r\nhigh toned gentleman, and every subsequent interview is certain to confirm\r\nit. He is a man of strict business habits, and expects his dues, and yet\r\nhis large benevolence and goodness of heart not only prevents the\r\nslightest approach to meanness, but often causes him to suffer wrong\r\nrather than be thought to be doing wrong himself. Were it otherwise, he\r\nwould have been one of the richest men in Cleveland to-day, for he\r\nposseses both the ability and energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nO. A. Childs.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong our most energetic firms is that of O. A. Childs & Co., manufacturers\r\nand wholesale dealers in boots and shoes, Water street. It was commenced\r\nby Messrs. Seymour & Crowell near twenty years since. It became Crowell &\r\nChilds in 1856, and so continued until 1864, when, by the death of Mr.\r\nCrowell, it became O. A. Childs & Co. The business of this firm has\r\nsteadily increased from the first and their yearly sales now amount to\r\nabout $700,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, they commenced manufacturing a portion of their own goods, and\r\nsince 1860 have manufactured all their leading lines, i.e., those they\r\ndepend upon for service. Their trade extends through Ohio, Michigan,\r\nIndiana, Pennsylvania, a large amount being annually transacted in the\r\nLake Superior region.\r\n\r\nAlthough born in Massachusetts, Mr. Childs has lived in this city from\r\nboyhood and may with propriety be called a Clevelander. He is still a\r\nyoung and active merchant and one who has made himself a thorough,\r\ncompetent business man in all its details, from the cellar to the counting\r\nroom. This, with unlimited energy, has brought him success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames McDermott.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the mercantile interests, having their headquarters at Cleveland,\r\nwhich during a comparatively few years have grown into prominent sources\r\nof wealth and are yearly expanding in value and adding to the material\r\nprosperity of the city, the Building Stone and Grindstone interest is\r\nworthy of especial mention. Only a very few years since this trade was in\r\nits infancy, and as late as 1863 had not come to be recognized as worthy\r\nof special efforts for its development. That it then became so is in great\r\nmeasure owing to the sagacity and enterprise of the firm of James\r\nMcDermott & Co.\r\n\r\nJames McDermott was born in the village of Whitby, county of Ontario,\r\nCanada West, on the 19th of September, 1836. His father, who is still\r\nliving, is by birth an Irishman and a native of the city of Dublin. His\r\nmother, who is also living, was born in the county of Ontario, Canada\r\nWest. The father of Mr. McDermott is a man of considerable culture, and in\r\nall the relations of life has been distinguished for great energy and the\r\nstrictest probity. His mother is no less distinguished for her uprightness\r\nand her clear perception of moral duty, and especially for the energy and\r\ndetermination of her character.\r\n\r\nJames McDermott is the oldest of a family of eleven children, and as not\r\nunfrequently happens to an oldest son, where the parents are in moderate\r\ncircumstances, James found himself at an early period of his life clothed\r\nwith important duties connected with the care of the family. When in his\r\ntwelfth year the family moved from the village of Whitby to a farm in the\r\nsame township, and here came a change in the relations of the young lad,\r\nin the new duties he was required to assume, which laid the foundation of\r\nthose correct business habits which have given him his present honorable\r\nposition in the business community. His father occupied the post of United\r\nStates Consul and Harbor Master (the latter embracing all the functions of\r\na Collectorship) at the port of Whitby, together with several local\r\noffices which required his whole attention on every day of the week except\r\nSunday. During the week, therefore, much of the business connected with\r\nthe working and care of the farm was devolved upon James. The farm, being\r\na new one, required to be cleared, and in this labor the young lad did his\r\nfull share, manifesting always the most indefatigable industry. The family\r\nremained on the farm some seven or eight years, during which time James\r\nbecame an adept in all kinds of farm work.\r\n\r\nYoung McDermott's opportunities for obtaining an education, at best\r\nlimited, were still further restricted by his farm life, and during the\r\nyears thus spent his progress in mental attainments was very moderate,\r\nembracing only what he could gather during a few weeks of winter from a\r\ncountry school in the elementary branches.\r\n\r\nA change at last came when the family quit the farm and removed to Whitby,\r\nin the year 1856. James was now twenty years of age, and being thrown into\r\nintimate contact with a larger number of his fellow men than ever before,\r\nthe ambitions and impulses of his young manhood were more keenly stirred.\r\nHe entered the office of his father, who still occupied the position of\r\nHarbor Master, and, though entirely ignorant of the duties, he quickly\r\nacquired a knowledge of the entire business and fulfilled all its\r\nrequirements with entire satisfaction. He here realized, however, more\r\nfully, his defective education, which he determined to improve with the\r\nleast possible delay. Only a few months were spent in his new position\r\nwhen he decided to set out in the world to seek his own fortune.\r\nAccordingly on the 10th of June, 1856, having packed all his personal\r\nproperty in a diminutive trunk, he bade adieu to his old home. Two days\r\nafter his departure from home young McDermott arrived in Cleveland and\r\nwent thence to Berea, where, as the sequel shows, was to be the scene of\r\nhis future enterprise. He had acquired some knowledge of carpenter work,\r\nand so obtained a situation on the Methodist Episcopal church, then in\r\ncourse of erection. Here he worked until harvest time, when he went into\r\nthe harvest field, working for one dollar per day. He worked through\r\nharvest and upon its conclusion took the first step in fulfillment of his\r\ndesign to improve his education, and entered school at Baldwin University.\r\nHe had no money to pay for tuition, but this he provided for by sweeping\r\nthe chapel, laboratory and halls of the college, earning sufficient money\r\nto meet his other wants, which were of course kept down to a very modest\r\nscale (as he boarded himself), by working in the stone quarries and\r\ncutting wood for the students. He studied hard and earnestly, and made\r\ngood progress, finishing his first term with very satisfactory results.\r\nAmong his acquirements during this period was a knowledge of the art of\r\nOriental pearl painting, and during the Fall vacation he turned this\r\naccomplishment to advantage by teaching the art in Cleveland, going from\r\nhouse to house for this purpose, and obtaining fifty cents per lesson. In\r\nthis way he earned sufficient to pay his tuition at the University during\r\nthe next term, provide himself with necessary books, and furnish his means\r\nof living. Having concluded another term at the University, in the Fall of\r\n1857, young McDermott came to Cleveland and took a course of writing\r\nlessons at a Commercial College. He attained considerable proficiency in\r\npenmanship, and in the winter of 1857-8 taught writing classes at\r\nLoweville and Youngstown, Mahoning county, and at the Female College at\r\nPoland, Ohio, meeting with good success and giving entire satisfaction. In\r\nFebruary, 1858, Mr. McDermott got his first introduction to the grindstone\r\nbusiness, having received an appointment from a firm at Berea to travel in\r\nCanada and solicit orders on commission. He visited Canada and worked\r\nhard, often walking twenty miles a day, from station to station, to save\r\ntime, carrying his satchel on his back, and paying his expenses by\r\nteaching the process of pearl painting. The trip was entirely successful,\r\nand Mr. McDermott returned to Berea in the Summer with a handsome sum in\r\npocket. Still anxious regarding his education, he again entered Baldwin\r\nUniversity, attending through the Fall term. In November of this year he\r\ncame to Cleveland, passed an examination and received a certificate to\r\nteach school, and upon this opened a school in Middleburgh township,\r\nCuyahoga county, making his evenings available by teaching writing and\r\nspelling classes. At the conclusion of the first term, in February, 1859,\r\nhe started upon a second trip to Canada, to solicit orders for stone, this\r\ntime on his own account. The venture was prosecuted with his usual\r\nindustry, and was highly successful. He returned to Berea in the Summer\r\nconsiderably better off financially than when he left it, and having,\r\nmeanwhile, placed a brother and two sisters at school in the University at\r\nhis own expense, he once again entered upon a course of study. He\r\nremained, however, but two months, in consequence of the illness of his\r\nfather calling him to Whitby to assume the duties of his father's office.\r\nHere he remained some two months, when his father's recovery enabled him\r\nto return to Berea. He commenced a commercial course, but was permitted to\r\npursue it barely a month when he was prostrated by a severe attack of\r\ntyphoid fever from which he did not recover for nearly four months, his\r\nlife being several times despaired of. As soon as his health was\r\nsufficiently restored, Mr. McDermott again identified himself with the\r\ngrindstone trade and made two trips to Canada, both very successful,\r\nbetween May and September, 1860, and then finished his commercial course.\r\nOn the 19th of September, his twenty-fourth birthday, Mr. McDermott was\r\nmarried at East Townsend, Huron county, Ohio, to Miss Henrietta Scott, who\r\nhad been a teacher in the Baldwin University, and a lady of superior\r\naccomplishments.\r\n\r\nIn this year he met with the most serious misfortune of his business life.\r\nHe shipped a cargo of stone for Canada, and the vessel encountering a\r\nstorm which disabled her, a large portion of the cargo was thrown\r\noverboard. The cargo was insured in the Quaker City Insurance Company of\r\nPhiladelphia, but before the claim could be adjusted the Company failed,\r\nand Mr. McDermott was rendered a considerable sum worse off than nothing.\r\nThis misfortune, however, only served to stimulate his energy, and having\r\nestablished a good credit by the promptitude with which he had always met\r\nhis business engagements, and at the same time created a high impression\r\nof his business qualifications, those with whom he had traded, and in\r\nwhose debt he had been brought, encouraged him to continue business by\r\nallowing him all the time he should require to repair his losses and make\r\nhimself whole. He soon made another trip to Canada with the most\r\ngratifying result, taking orders for upwards of three hundred tons of\r\nstone, the returns from which paid off all his indebtedness and left him\r\nsomething more than even with the world.\r\n\r\nFrom January to August, 1862, was spent by Mr. McDermott in Lower Canada,\r\nchiefly among the French population, and was one of the most successful\r\nperiods of his business experience thus far. Returning to Berea, we next\r\nfind him on his way to Cincinnati as one of a company of \"Squirrel\r\nHunters\" in response to a well-remembered call of Gov. Tod for a force to\r\nresist the threatened invasion of the State by the Confederate forces\r\nunder Kirby Smith. Arriving at Cincinnati it was found that the patriotic\r\ncitizens of Ohio had so freely answered the demand upon them that more\r\nthan enough to protect the State against several times the menacing army\r\nwere already on the ground, and the Berea company was permitted to return\r\nhome. The remaining months of the year were passed by Mr. McDermott in\r\nmaking preparations and perfecting plans for the ensuing year's business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Respectfully, James McDermott]\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of January, 1863, Mr. McDermott formed a copartnership with\r\nJohn Worthington, who was engaged in the building stone trade at\r\nBrownhelm, Lorain county, Ohio, the firm taking the title of Worthington &\r\nMcDermott. The firm immediately erected works for turning large\r\ngrindstones for manufactories, and distinguished their first Spring's\r\nbusiness by sending to New York city the first cargo of building stone\r\never shipped there from Ohio. During this year they furnished the stone\r\nfor all the trimmings and carved work on the Government buildings at\r\nOttawa, the capital of the Dominion of Canada, and also for a number of\r\nbuildings in Montreal and other cities and towns of Canada. The year's\r\nbusiness was heavy, and the result was largely due to the energy and\r\nenterprise of Mr. McDermott. In the latter part of the year Mr. McDermott\r\ntook up his residence in Cleveland, where he had purchased a house, and in\r\nthe spring of 1864 the office of the firm was removed to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe business of the firm was now growing vigorously, the result of the\r\nyear 1864 being in the highest degree satisfactory, not alone in the\r\npecuniary returns, but in the wider extension of the trade and the\r\nintroduction of the Ohio stone to markets where it had previously been\r\nunknown, and where it has since been in steady and large demand. Near the\r\nclose of the year the firm of Worthington & McDermott was dissolved, and\r\nMr. McDermott purchased of the Wallaces the old quarry at Berea originally\r\nopened by John Baldwin over forty years ago. He took into partnership his\r\nbrother William and established the firm of J. McDermott & Co. The new firm\r\nwent actively to work in developing its quarry, mining and manufacturing\r\nblock and grindstones, and succeeded rapidly in establishing valuable\r\nbusiness connections and enlarging the stone trade of this section. Among\r\nthe first improvements introduced was the building of a railroad track\r\nConnecting the quarry with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati track,\r\nand other facilities for the expeditions handling and getting out stone\r\nwere added as promptly as practicable. In the spring of 1865 the firm\r\nfilled a contract with the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad Company for stone\r\nwith which to replace the wooden bridges along the line of the road.\r\nDuring the year the firm made extensive progress in developing its quarry,\r\ntrenching to a greater depth than had yet been reached in any of the\r\nquarries, and obtaining a quality of building stone superior to any\r\nproduced up to this time in Ohio, which very soon became, and is still, in\r\nlarge demand. In the spring of 1866, the firm sold the first five hundred\r\ntons of Berea rock block stone that ever went to New York city, and\r\nsucceeded in so far interesting several of the largest builders of the\r\nmetropolis in this stone as to induce them to visit the Berea quarries.\r\nDuring the year 1867, the firm sent to New York all the clear rock block\r\nstone they could get out, and also filled several large contracts for\r\nblock stone with the Cleveland and Toledo and Lake Shore Railroad\r\nCompanies, doing this year a very large business. On the 1st of January,\r\n1867, the firm was increased by taking in another brother, Mr. Michael\r\nMcDermott, the firm name remaining unchanged.\r\n\r\nThe house of J. McDermott & Co. occupies at this time a leading position\r\nin the stone trade of Ohio, and indeed of the West, not alone in the\r\namount of its annual business, but in credit, character and influence, and\r\nin these latter respects it is hardly surpassed by any mercantile house in\r\nNorthern Ohio. The trade of the house not only extends to nearly every\r\nState of the Union and the Dominion of Canada, but the product of its\r\nquarries finds a market in Mexico, South America and other parts of the\r\nworld. During 1867, this house furnished the stone for fourteen blocks and\r\nfronts in New York city, and a number of buildings in Boston, New Haven\r\nand other cities, and in 1868, the business was largely increased. A\r\nsingle firm of builders in New York city erected during that year fifteen\r\nbuildings and fronts for which J. McDermott & Co. furnished the stone.\r\n\r\nThe quarries owned by this firm embrace twenty-five acres of land of which\r\nless than an acre has been worked out. In 1867, they turned out 106,200\r\ncubic feet of block stone, 46,000 feet of flagging, 119 car loads of rough\r\nblock stone, and 1,510 tons of small grindstones. These quarries are\r\nvalued at $200,000, and the excellent quality of the stone produced is\r\namply attested by the large and increasing demand for it.\r\n\r\nThe business of the house of J. McDermott & Co. is under the immediate\r\npersonal supervision of Mr. James McDermott, to whose experience,\r\nenterprise and business capacity its marked success is due. Mr. McDermott\r\nhas taken an active interest in all that relates to the stone business,\r\nand also to whatever tends to build up the prosperity of Cleveland. In\r\n1866 and 1867, he visited Washington to procure the modification of the\r\ninternal tax and import duty on stone, and was successful in his\r\nendeavors. He also brought about the organization of the \"Association of\r\nthe Grindstone and Block Stone Manufactures of Northern Ohio,\" a work\r\nwhich was not accomplished without much difficulty, in spite of the fact\r\nthat it was for the mutual benefit of all engaged in the trade. It should\r\nbe mentioned in this connection that the firm issued a valuable series of\r\ntables of weights of grindstones, and rules for computing the same, now in\r\ngeneral use by manufacturers, and which was chiefly compiled by Mrs.\r\nMcDermott. The most recent public work of Mr. McDermott was his active\r\nlabor in organizing the Cleveland, Wooster and Zanesville Railroad\r\nCompany, to which he has devoted time, money and labor.\r\n\r\nMr. McDermott is still young, being but thirty-two years old, of fine\r\nphysical proportions, a robust constitution, and clear, comprehensive\r\nmind. His healthfulness, and also his success in business, he attributes\r\nin large measure to his habit of strict temperance. In business matters he\r\nis prompt, scrupulously conscientious, and holding a verbal engagement to\r\nbe as binding as the most carefully drawn contract. In private and social\r\ncircles he is warm-hearted, cheerful, and every way a pleasant companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. A. Redington.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. A. Redington is son of Captain John Redington, formerly of Saratoga\r\ncounty, New York, who, when nineteen years of age, ran away from his\r\nstepfather, who abused him, and volunteered into the Revolutionary army,\r\nwhere he served seven years, and was taken prisoner by the British, and\r\nincarcerated in the Sugar House, New York. There the privation that fell\r\nto his lot in the great struggle for freedom, nearly killed him. Had Capt.\r\nRedington lived till the present time he would have been one hundred and\r\ntwelve years old. J. A. Redington, the subject of this sketch, was born\r\nJune 4, 1818, when his father was sixty-one years old, and there were five\r\nchildren born to the old soldier afterwards. At the birth of the last, he\r\nwas seventy-two years of age.\r\n\r\nTen years of the boyhood of J. A. was spent with an uncle in Vermont, where\r\nhe received a good common school education. While living at that place his\r\nfather died, and at the age of sixteen he had a keen realization of the\r\nsituation. He had nothing, and could not mend matters where he was, so he\r\ndetermined to go home to his mother and see if he could be of service\r\nthere. After remaining with his mother a year, he engaged with a\r\nship-chandler at Oswego, for twenty-five dollars per year and board. After\r\na few months his employer closed up, leaving him out of employment. About\r\na year from this time, his former employer, who had gone to Cleveland,\r\nwrote him that if he would come to Cleveland he would employ him again. He\r\nworked his passage on a canal boat from his home to Oswego, where he took\r\npassage on board a vessel just leaving for Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe late Chester Deming was the gentleman who had engaged his services. He\r\nreceived two hundred dollars the first year, three hundred the second\r\nyear, and four hundred the third, on which handsome salary, for those\r\ntimes, he concluded to marry.\r\n\r\nMr. Deming closed up his business here in 1841, and Mr. Redington\r\ncommenced on his own account, dealing in oats, wheat and other grains.\r\nThis continued about a year when he formed a partnership for the purpose\r\nof opening a general furnishing house for vessels. He did a successful\r\nbusiness, but as it was only during the summer months, he established a\r\ndry goods store in connection with it on the West Side. This enterprise\r\nwas only partially successful, and so he closed it up, and for several\r\nyears was employed as clerk on board a steam boat.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, he, in connection with Mr. Bacon, commenced the shipping and\r\nforwarding business, built the vessel E. C. Roberts, which was a\r\nprofitable investment, and also ran the propeller Manhattan. This\r\npartnership was dissolved after two years, Mr. Redington retaining his\r\nvessel interests. He is now engaged in mercantile pursuits on the river,\r\ndealing principally in pig metal.\r\n\r\nBy dint of hard work and a determination to succeed in spite of adverse\r\ncircumstances, and by strict integrity, he has accomplished his purpose\r\nand acquired a comfortable competency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Sage Coe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS. S. Coe has been favorably known in the business circles of Cleveland\r\nfor over thirty years, and, although he has not succeeded in amassing as\r\nmuch wealth as some of his competitors, yet his fortitude has enabled him\r\nto glide over reverses easily, and enjoy somewhat of life as it came.\r\n\r\nMr. Coe was born in Oswego, New York, October 6th, 1819. He obtained all\r\nthe education a widowed mother could give him before he was twelve years\r\nof age, when he entered a country store and remained five years. The only\r\nrecreation he had during that time was a trip to Niagara, on the schooner\r\nSaratoga, with Capt. Dolph. Howe, with whom some of our citizens are well\r\nacquainted. In 1836, he went to New York and clerked in the hardware store\r\nof Wolf, Bishop & Co., and returned to Oswego in June, 1837. Not being\r\nable to find employment there, he concluded to try his fortune in the\r\nWest, and at once took the schooner Charles Crooks, bound for Cleveland.\r\nMr. Coe landed in this city July 19th, 1837, his cash capital being at the\r\ntime one dollar and twenty-five cents. After a few days a situation was\r\nobtained in the office of Ransom, McNair & Co., with a salary of thirty\r\ndollars per month, out of which he had to board himself. He remained with\r\nthis firm until about 1841, when he went into the employ of B. F. Smith &\r\nCo., composed of B. F. Smith, now residing at Buffalo, as superintendent of\r\nthe Buffalo and Erie Railroad, and George Woodward, now residing at\r\nMilwaukee, with whom he remained until 1845, when he engaged in business\r\nfor himself, in the firm of Doddridge & Coe, in the forwarding and\r\ncommission line. In about one year this firm dissolved, and Mr. Coe went\r\ninto the same business with his brother, Chas. W., under the style of S. S.\r\nCoe & Co. This firm was unfortunate, and existed only one year.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, while doing a small commission business alone, he was offered,\r\nand accepted, the agency of the Merchants' Insurance Company, of\r\nMilwaukee, and labored faithfully for them one year, and, at its close,\r\nhis premiums amounted to less than two hundred dollars. This was the first\r\ninsurance company with which he was ever connected.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, Mr. Coe organized and got into operation the Commercial Mutual\r\nInsurance Company, of this city, acting as its Secretary for about one\r\nyear and a half, when he resigned, and went into the insurance agency\r\nbusiness, with which he has ever since been identified.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, Mr. Henry F. Clark desired him to reorganize the Cleveland\r\nInsurance Company, the charter of which was granted by the State of Ohio\r\nin 1830, and which was successfully managed by his father, Mr. Edmund\r\nClark, until his death. Mr. Coe undertook and completed the task, and\r\noperations re-commenced April 1st, of the same year, on a paid up cash\r\ncapital of one hundred thousand dollars, increased in 1866, to one hundred\r\nand fifty thousand; and in 1867, to two hundred thousand dollars, and now\r\nincreased to its limit, five hundred thousand dollars, making it the\r\nlargest cash capital company in the State of Ohio, a credit to the city\r\nand to the State at large.\r\n\r\nMr. Coe is the right man in the right place, as the successful workings of\r\nthis company fully demonstrate. He, as secretary, devotes his whole\r\nattention to the interest of the company. H. B. Payne is the president,\r\nand S. D. McMillan, vice-president.\r\n\r\nIn looking over a correspondence of about twenty years ago, in search of\r\nsome data connected with Mr. Coe's history, we came on the following\r\nletters, which will be read with amusement by old Clevelanders, as\r\nreminiscences of the ante-railroad period, and for the allusions to public\r\nand political events of that day, as well as for the contrast between the\r\nirascible tone of one letter, and the cool humor of the other:\r\n\r\n  Messrs. S. S. Coe & Co., Cleveland, Ohio:\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen,--No one dislikes, more than we do, to grumble or find fault,\r\n  but we hate just as bad to have our boats detained beyond a reasonable\r\n  time, at your place; and when our boats leave here for your place, we\r\n  look for them back at a certain time; and if they do not get here soon\r\n  after that time, it disarranges all our calculations and proves a great\r\n  loss to us. All our boats were detained a week on account of a break in\r\n  our canal, and then to be detained beyond a reasonable time in port,\r\n  makes it worse. Mr. Wheeler, at Akron, is the only man on the Ohio\r\n  canal, that we know of, that has been in the business longer than we\r\n  have on our canal, and we defy you to find a boatman on our canal or\r\n  river that will say we ever detained them beyond a reasonable time; and\r\n  there is no need of it if men do as they would be done by, and the\r\n  situation our river has been in this geason has been vexatious enough\r\n  for any one. Time is money, and eight or ten boats being detained a day\r\n  or two counts up. The J. Larkin left for your place to-day.\r\n\r\n  Tours truly,\r\n\r\n  S. Adams & Co.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cleveland, July 29th, 1848. Messrs. Sam'l Adams & Co., Dresden, O.:\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen,--Your esteemed favor of the 25th inst. is at hand.\r\n\r\n  It has been a matter of some considerable interest to us to ascertain,\r\n  if possible, as to which city takes precedence in age, Zanesville or\r\n  Cleveland.\r\n\r\n  As, which incident is first in date, the cutting of the bridle path from\r\n  Wheeling to the Muskingum by Old Zane, or the coasting of our lake to\r\n  the Cuyahoga of the exploring party under Old Stow. Your Mr. Adams, we\r\n  are quite sure, can give us the much desired information.\r\n\r\n  We see it stated that our good Democratic candidate for President once\r\n  resided at or near your beautiful village. You may be familiar with\r\n  his early history--we wish to know, if such a thing is possible,\r\n  whether he commenced his political career as a Federalist or a\r\n  Democrat, and whether he did or did not break his sword at the\r\n  disgraceful surrender of that old coward Hull; but more than all, as\r\n  we think it most important of all, is, did he, or did he not, when at\r\n  the age of nineteen, wear that emblem of Federalism, the black\r\n  cockade. To this last question we beg you will give us an answer if\r\n  such a thing be possible.\r\n\r\n  While troubling you in this manner, for which we beg your kind\r\n  indulgence, may we also ask you as to the condition, moral and physical\r\n  of your returned volunteers? Report says they have been badly treated;\r\n  we are anxious to know as to this, for if so, and commanded by Whig'\r\n  officers, we can make political capital out of it against the Whig\r\n  party; if not, we can make capital against the administration; we do not\r\n  care which, as our object is to do justice to both parties. Can you tell\r\n  us which candidate they will support. They are important in numbers, and\r\n  from their high character, will carry a great, moral force with them;\r\n  and on this last account we have supposed they would oppose General\r\n  Taylor, as it has been said he used profane language at the battle of\r\n  Buena Vista.\r\n\r\n  We are erecting here a new and beautiful theater, it opens Aug. 21. We\r\n  hope we may see you here at that time.\r\n\r\n  Your ob't serv'ts,\r\n\r\n  S. S. Coe & Co.\r\n\r\n  P.S. You are right as to the _unnecessary_ detention at this place of\r\n  canal boats; it is an evil of great turpitude. _We never do so_. Aside\r\n  from the great loss to owner, it affects the morals of the crews, and\r\n  in this we know the oldest forwarder on the canal, Mr. Wheeler, will\r\n  agree with us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Long Severance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConspicuous among those former residents of Cleveland who have passed away\r\nand left only a pleasant memory behind them, is John Long Severance, who\r\ndied about ten years ago, mourned by a wide circle of friends, whom his\r\nmany lovable qualities had brought around him.\r\n\r\nMr. Severance was born in 1822, his father being Dr. Robert Severance, of\r\nShelburne, Massachusetts. His parents dying within a few months of each\r\nother, when he was but nine years old, young Severance was adopted by the\r\nlate Dr. Long, of Cleveland, who gave him every advantage in the way of\r\neducation that could be procured in the city. A college course was\r\nintended but his delicate health forbade this, and in his sixteenth year\r\nhe was taken into the old Commercial Bank of Lake Erie, and then into the\r\nreorganized institution, remaining there twenty years.\r\n\r\nHis health, never good, broke down entirely under the fatiguing duties of\r\nthe bank, and he was compelled to resign his connection with that\r\ninstitution and seek a restoration of his wasted vigor by a voyage to\r\nEurope. At Southampton, England, he died on the 30th August, 1859, at the\r\nage of thirty-seven, surrounded by every attention which kind friends and\r\nsympathizing strangers could bestow upon him.\r\n\r\nMr. Severance was a man of many rare and sterling attractions. His social\r\nqualities, passion for music, and love for little children, as well as\r\nsincere attachment to a large circle of friends, caused general mourning\r\nfor his death. He was one of the founders of the Second Presbyterian\r\nchurch, and by the members of that body his loss was keenly felt. He had\r\nalways felt a deep interest in the prosperity of the church, contributing\r\nlargely through his rare ability as a musician, both in the choir and in\r\nthe Sunday schools, to the welfare of the congregation, until he was\r\nobliged to abandon those services on account of advancing disease. With\r\nrare energy and many reasons for desiring to live, he was slow to believe\r\nthat he must fall in early manhood before the destroyer. And while he was\r\nnot afraid to die, and expressed a firm confidence in God in whatever\r\nevent, he felt it to be his duty to struggle for a longer life, and no\r\ndoubt prolonged his days in this manner. He was consistent, uniform,\r\nearnest, stable, both in faith and practice; always punctual in the\r\ndischarge of his business and Christian duties, his attendance in the\r\nchurch, and his labors in the mission and Sunday schools. His last letter\r\nbefore death, written to an intimate personal and business friend, said:\r\n\"I feel quite sure the disease is making rapid progress, but this gives me\r\nno uneasiness or alarm, nor have I experienced any feeling but that I am\r\nhastening home. The prospect would be dark indeed with no hope in Christ,\r\nno deep and abiding trust in God's pardoning love. This trust in him has\r\nsustained me through every trial, and this hope in Christ and his\r\nall-atoning blood grows brighter every day, taking away the fear of death,\r\nand lighting up the pathway through the dark valley, through which so many\r\nof my loved ones have already passed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D. Sanford]\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Sanford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Daniel Sanford, whose name is held in esteem by old Clevelanders,\r\nwas born in Milford, Connecticut, in 1803. At a very early age he left his\r\nhome and went to New York where he learned the trade of a ship joiner, one\r\nof his first jobs being upon the cabins of the Fairfield, the first\r\nsteamer on the East River.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, he came to Cleveland and worked for some time at his trade as a\r\njourneyman ship joiner. In coming time he aspired to build ships on his\r\nown account, and for this purpose formed a partnership with Luther Moses.\r\nThe first work done by the firm was on the steamer New York, and\r\nsubsequently the steamers Ohio and Saratoga were built by them. In\r\naddition to these a very large number of propellers and sailing vessels\r\nwere built, and canal boats almost without number. The mere list of crafts\r\nof one description and another, built by this firm, would take\r\nconsiderable space in our pages.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, the firm, which had done so much important work in the ship\r\nyards, was dissolved and Mr. Sanford changed his business from\r\nship-building to dealing in lumber, which he entered upon on a large scale\r\nand continued under the title of D. Sanford, and subsequently Sanford &\r\nSon, until his death, which occurred on Sunday morning, September 22,\r\n1864, after an illness of about four weeks, the disease being inflammation\r\nof the bowels.\r\n\r\nMr. Sanford came to Cleveland with but five hundred dollars in his pocket,\r\nbut he worked his way with prudence and economy till he had acquired a\r\nhandsome property. His business on his death descended to his third son,\r\nNelson Sanford, who has conducted it prudently and with success.\r\n\r\nHe was earnestly patriotic, and on the outbreak of the war for the\r\nUnion he took a lively interest in everything pertaining to it.\r\nBecoming satisfied that the rebels never intended submission to the\r\nlawful authorities until they were flogged into submission, he strongly\r\nurged their severe punishment, and contributed liberally to send men\r\ninto the field.\r\n\r\nMr. Sanford was a strong advocate of the consolidation of Ohio City and\r\nCleveland, and in his position of member of the Ohio City Council aided\r\nmaterially in bringing about the result. He was no politician, but was not\r\none of those who make that fact an excuse for taking no interest in public\r\naffairs. He had decided views on public matters, and never avoided his\r\nduties as a citizen.\r\n\r\nIn whatever concerned the welfare of the city he took strong interest, and\r\nwas one of the first stockholders of the Cleveland, Columbus and\r\nCincinnati Railroad Company, as he was also of the Cleveland and Mahoning\r\nRailroad Company.\r\n\r\nEvery dollar of Mr. Sanford's money was honestly earned; not a hard,\r\nmean, or wrongful action tarnished a single penny passing into his\r\nhands. Had he been avaricious he might have died worth half a million\r\ndollars, but he was infinitely richer in the blessings of hundreds of\r\npoor people who were the secret recipients of his bounty. He had \"a hand\r\nopen as day for melting charity.\" Yet in his good deeds he never let his\r\nleft hand know what his right hand did. His last words on earth were of\r\na character in keeping with his whole life. Calling his youngest son to\r\nhis bedside he said, \"Benjamin, be honest in all your transactions.\" On\r\nthe tomb of David Sanford can with truth be written: \"An honest man--the\r\nnoblest work of God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles W. Coe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles W. Coe, so long and favorably known in our business circles, was\r\nborn in Oswego, New York, March 19th, 1822. His grandfather, Col. Eli\r\nParsons, was a soldier in the Revolution, and prominent in the Shay's\r\nRebellion, in Massachusetts. His father was a physician of much note in\r\nOswego, and died about 1828, leaving two children; Charles, the younger,\r\nis the subject of this sketch. Like a great many other physicians, he left\r\na number of old accounts of no value, and not a great deal besides, so\r\nthat Charles and his brother had to strike out early in life to do\r\nsomething towards getting a living, and hence educational matters did not\r\nreceive all the desired attention.\r\n\r\nCharles came to Cleveland in 1840, and at once engaged as clerk with N. E.\r\nCrittenden, jeweler. He remained in that situation about a year, when he\r\nreturned to Oswego, and after the lapse of two years, came back to\r\nCleveland, and entered into the employ of Pease & Allen, produce and\r\ncommission merchants, with whom he remained until 1849. At that time, he\r\nwent into the employ of Mr. Charles Hickox, and continued with him until\r\n1855, when he took an interest with Mr. Hickox in the milling business,\r\nalready referred to in this work, and in which he still continues.\r\n\r\nMr. Coe has won his present prominent position among the business men of\r\nCleveland by shrewd foresight and close attention to business. He is a\r\nhard worker and a keen observer of the fluctuations of business, mingling\r\nprudence with enterprise to such a degree that, whilst he has driven a\r\nprofitable business, it has always been a safe one. He is frank,\r\nunselfish, and free hearted. Whilst having had reason to appreciate the\r\nvalue of money, he esteems it not so much on its own account as on account\r\nof the domestic comforts and enjoyments its judicious expenditure brings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS. M. Strong\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drug establishment of Strong & Armstrong stands foremost in that\r\nbranch of the business of Cleveland and has achieved a wide reputation,\r\nhaving an extensive trade not only through Northern Ohio, but in Indiana,\r\nMichigan and Pennsylvania, drawing custom away from Pittsburgh, Cincinnati\r\nand Detroit in territory previously considered naturally tributary to\r\nthose places.\r\n\r\nS. M. Strong, the leading partner of the firm, is a native Buckeye, having\r\nbeen born in Lorain County, Ohio, in 1833. His boyhood was spent in\r\nacquiring a good common school education, after obtaining which he became\r\nclerk in a drug store at Elyria, entering it at the age of sixteen and\r\nremaining about two years when, in 1850, he accompanied his employer, who\r\nremoved to Cleveland, and remained with him there three years more.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time, he entered Gaylord's drug store, in which he\r\ncontinued about two years, when he turned his attention to pushing a\r\nfever and ague remedy which he had been at work on for several years\r\nprevious. Four years he devoted to this work, finding a partial success,\r\nand then he formed a partnership with A. C. Armstrong, of Medina county,\r\nfor the purpose of building up a wholesale and retailing business. The\r\nbusiness of Henderson & Punderson, which was established in 1836, was\r\npurchased, and the new firm of Strong & Armstrong opened business in the\r\nold place, No. 199 Superior street. At first the business was carried on\r\nin a limited way, the total of jobbing and retail sales for the first year\r\namounting to but $75,000. But the partners were young, energetic, and full\r\nof hope. They pushed their trade vigorously, attended closely to the\r\ndetails of the business, and mingled enterprise with prudent economy so\r\nwell that they were soon gratified at finding their business annually\r\ngrowing larger and more profitable. In less than ten years their trade has\r\ngrown from about $75,000 in a year to over $600,000, and their limited\r\nestablishment so enlarged as to require the services of twenty-four\r\nassistants. The business, though large, has been managed with such care\r\nand prudence as to render losses very light and litigation almost wholly\r\nunnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShip Building\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor years Cleveland has been the principal ship building port on the\r\nlakes. Of late the ship building interest here has shared the depression\r\nfelt by it throughout the Union, but it is still an important interest,\r\nand before long will probably resume its activity.\r\n\r\nThe first vessel reported built in the vicinity of Cleveland was the\r\nZephyr, thirty tons burthen, built by Mr. Carter, in 1808, for the trade\r\nof the village. The precise spot of her building is not recorded. She was\r\nburned at Conjocketa Creek, near Black Rock. The next was the Ohio, of\r\nsixty tons, built by Murray and Bixby, in 1810, and launched from the East\r\nbank of the river near the spot now occupied by Pettit & Holland's\r\nwarehouse. She was sailed by John Austen and afterwards became a gunboat\r\nin Perry's fleet, but took no part in the battle of Lake Erie, being\r\nabsent on special service.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, Levi Johnson built the Pilot. The story of her construction and\r\nlaunch has already been told in the sketch of Levi Johnson's life. In that\r\nsketch also will be found the account of most of the early ship building\r\nof Cleveland, he being the principal ship builder of the pioneer days.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, Philo Taylor built the Prudence, which was launched on the river\r\nopposite where the New England block now stands.\r\n\r\nIn 1826, John Blair built the Macedonian, of sixty tons, and in the same\r\nyear the Lake Serpent, forty tons, was built by Captain Bartiss and\r\nsailed by him.\r\n\r\nThe first steamboat built in Cleveland was the Enterprise, built by Levi\r\nJohnson in 1826, but not floated into the lake until the following year.\r\n\r\nThe enterprise of ship building pursued a steady course in Cleveland for a\r\nnumber of years, a few vessels being added annually, until about the year\r\n1853, when the business took a sudden start and made rapid progress. For\r\nthe next few years the ship yards were busy and the ship building interest\r\nwas one of the most important branches of the business of the city. In\r\n1856, a total of thirty-seven lake crafts, sail and steam, was reported\r\nbuilt, having a tonnage of nearly sixteen thousand tons. During the past\r\ntwenty years, nearly five hundred vessels of all kinds, for lake\r\nnavigation, have been built in the district of Cuyahoga, and of these all\r\nbut a small proportion were built in Cleveland. The description of vessels\r\nbuilt has greatly altered during that time, the size of the largest class\r\nhaving more than trebled. During the year 1868, there were built in this\r\nport four propellers, one steamer and three schooners, with an aggregate\r\nof 3,279 tons. This is much less in number and tonnage than in some\r\nprevious years, but still gives Cleveland the lead in the ship building of\r\nthe lakes. The absorption of the flats on the lower part of the river for\r\nrailroad and manufacturing purposes, and for lumber yards, has seriously\r\nincommoded the ship building interests by restricting the space available\r\nfor ship yards.\r\n\r\nIn the division of the ship building business of the lakes in past years,\r\nthe construction of large side-wheel steamers was principally carried on\r\nat Buffalo, whilst in first class propellers and sailing vessels Cleveland\r\nimmeasurably distanced all competitors, both in the quantity and quality\r\nof the craft turned out. As the demand for side-wheel steamers lessened,\r\nthe site of their construction was removed from Buffalo to Detroit.\r\nCleveland-built propellers, however, take front rank, and Cleveland-built\r\nsail vessels have found their way over every part of the lake chain,\r\nsailed down the Atlantic coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to South\r\nAmerican ports, and crossing the Atlantic, have penetrated nearly every\r\nEuropean sea. Everywhere they have done credit to their builders by their\r\nspeed, sea worthiness, and excellent construction.\r\n\r\nJust here it is proper to place, on record the history of an attempt to\r\nestablish a direct trade with Europe, which gave abundant promise of good\r\nresults, both to the commercial and ship building interests of the city.\r\nIt has already been referred to in this work, but it appropriately falls\r\nwithin the scope of this sketch.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1856, the schooner Dean Richmond, of 379 tons, was built by\r\nQuayle & Martin in Cleveland, for C. J. Kershaw, of Chicago. This vessel\r\nwas loaded with wheat and under the command of Capt. D. C. Pierce, sailed\r\nfrom Chicago to Liverpool. She arrived in good time, having made a quick\r\npassage, and astonished the English people by her rig, and from the fact\r\nof her having come from the inland lakes of America to Europe. The\r\nschooner was sold in Liverpool, and her new owners changed her name to\r\nthe Belina, and placed her in the trade between Liverpool and Brazil, on\r\nwhich route she made quick and successful trips.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, the same builders turned out the barque c.J. Kershaw, of 380 tons\r\nburthen, having built her for Capt. D. G. Pierce, who was the pioneer\r\ncaptain in the trade. The Kershaw was loaded with staves, cedar posts and\r\nblack walnut lumber. In the Fall, she started on her return with a load of\r\ncrockery and iron, but was twice driven back by terrific gales and had to\r\ngo into dock for repairs. This brought her into St. Lawrence river so\r\nlate, that she was frozen in the Lachine Canal. Early in 1858, she arrived\r\nin Cleveland with her cargo in excellent order and to the perfect\r\nsatisfaction of the consignees.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that the Kershaw was launched, a small British schooner,\r\nthe Madeira Pet of 123 tons, came from Liverpool through the rivers and\r\nlakes to Chicago, with a cargo of hardware, cutlery, glass, &c., on\r\nspeculation. The enterprise was not successful, and no more attempts were\r\nmade to establish a direct trade between Chicago and European ports.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spring and Summer of 1858, several of the leading business men\r\nof Cleveland entered with vigor into the trade, and a respectable fleet of\r\nvessels was dispatched to European ports. A new barque, the D. C. Pierce,\r\nwas built for Messrs. Pierce & Barney and sent to Liverpool with a cargo\r\nof staves and black walnut lumber. The same parties sent the C. J. Kershaw\r\nto London with a similar cargo, and the Chieftain and Black Hawk, with the\r\nsame kind of freight. Mr. T. P. Handy sent the R. H. Harmon with staves and\r\nblack walnut lumber to Liverpool, the D. B. Sexton with a similar cargo to\r\nLondon, and the J. F. Warner with a cargo of the same kind to Glasgow. Mr.\r\nH. E. Howe sent the new barque H. E. Howe to London with a cargo of staves\r\nand lumber. Col. N. M. Standart sent the Correspondent to Liverpool with a\r\nload of wheat, and Mr. C. Reis freighted the Harvest to Hamburgh with a\r\ncargo of lumber, staves and fancy woods. This made a fleet of ten vessels,\r\nowned and freighted by Cleveland merchants, with a total tonnage of about\r\n3,600 tons. Two vessels were sent out from Detroit with similar cargoes,\r\nbut the enterprise was pre-eminently a Cleveland one.\r\n\r\nAll of the Cleveland fleet disposed of their cargoes to good advantage.\r\nSix of them returned with cargoes of crockery, bar iron, pig iron, and\r\nsalt. This part of the trip also proved successful. It was the intention\r\nof the owners to sell some of the vessels in England, but the shipping\r\ninterests were so prostrated that it was impossible to dispose of the\r\nships at anything like a fair price. They therefore still remained in the\r\nhands of Cleveland owners, but four of them did not return to the Lakes.\r\nThe D. B. Sexton went up the Mediterranean; the H. E. Howe went on a\r\nvoyage to South America, the Harvest to the West Indies, and the C. J.\r\nKershaw was employed in the Mediterranean trade. Wherever any of the\r\nCleveland vessels went, they called forth complimentary remarks by their\r\nfleetness and steadiness in heavy weather.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, other vessels were sent out and made successful\r\ntrips. The remarkable sea-going qualities exhibited by these lake-built\r\ncrafts, outsailing, as they did, ocean clippers and weathering gales that\r\nsent sea-going ships flying helpless before the storm, attracted the\r\nattention of Eastern ship-owners, and orders were received for vessels to\r\nbe built for the Atlantic coasting trade. The outbreak of the war gave a\r\nsevere check to the direct trade, which passed into the hands of an\r\nEnglish firm who still continue to run vessels between Cleveland and\r\nLiverpool, and in the depressed condition of the American carrying trade\r\non the ocean there was no longer a demand for new vessels for the coasting\r\ntrade. With a revival of business in that line, and an enlargement of the\r\ncanals between Lake Erie and tidewater, so as to allow the passage of\r\nlarger vessels, there is a probability that a brisk demand for Cleveland\r\nvessels for the salt water will yet spring up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Respectfully, S. W. Johnson]\r\n\r\n\r\nSeth W. Johnson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Seth W. Johnson has for more than thirty years been closely\r\nand prominently identified with the ship building interests of\r\nCleveland. He saw the business in its infancy, was largely accessory to\r\nits growth into the important proportions it at last assumed, and though\r\nno longer engaged in the business, his withdrawal from it is so recent\r\nthat the mention of his name suggests, to those familiar with the\r\naffairs of the city for a number of years, the incessant tapping of the\r\nshipwrights' hammers and visions of skeleton ships gradually assuming\r\nthe form and substance in which they are to carry the commerce of the\r\ngreat West to market.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson was a native of Middle Haddam, Middlesex County, Connecticut,\r\nhis mother, who died October 17, 1868, being formerly Miss Mary Whitmore,\r\nborn at Middletown, Middlesex County, Connecticut, in 1780, and his\r\nfather, Henry Johnson, born in 1776, and died July 6, 1869. Seth W.\r\nJohnson was the second son and third child of a family of nine, all of\r\nwhom, with both father and mother, were alive on the 16th of October,\r\n1868, the oldest child being then about sixty-one years old, and the\r\nyoungest over forty.\r\n\r\nYoung Johnson worked with his father a short time as a farmer, but not\r\nfeeling in his element in the plow field or in the cow yard, he followed\r\nthe bent of his mechanical tastes, and engaged himself to work in a ship\r\nyard. He commenced work in this line when about fourteen years old, and\r\nserved out his full apprenticeship of seven years, when he set up in\r\nbusiness for himself, taking full charge of the work of finishing ships.\r\nThis he carried on for three years with considerable success.\r\n\r\nBut New England, he rightly judged, was too narrow a field for the young\r\nman who wished to improve his prospects and with narrow means lay the\r\nfoundation of a liberal competence. The West offered the most promise, and\r\nto the West he accordingly came, taking his kit of tools with him. Landing\r\nin Cleveland in the Fall of 1834, he satisfied himself that here was the\r\nproper place for the exercise of his knowledge and abilities, and here,\r\naccordingly, he prepared to make his home. Before settling down to steady\r\nbusiness in Cleveland he made a trip to Perrysburgh, on the Maumee, where\r\nhe assisted in finishing the Commodore Perry. This work done he returned\r\nto Cleveland in the Spring of 1835, and opened his ship yard, at first\r\nconfining himself to the repair of vessels. But soon he was called on to\r\nbuild as well as repair. The steamboat Constellation was completed by him\r\nat Black River, and the steamboat Robert Fulton, built at Cleveland by\r\nGriffith, Standart & Co.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Mr. Johnson associated with him Mr. E. Tisdale, and the firm of\r\nJohnson & Tisdale acquired honorable fame as ship builders along the\r\nentire chain of lakes and beyond. The copartnership lasted nineteen years.\r\nBefore the formation of this partnership, Mr. Tisdale had commenced the\r\nbuilding of a railway for docking vessels, and this was the first firm to\r\nlift vessels for the purpose of repairing them. With his first work, in\r\n1835, in Cleveland, he commenced the acquisition of vessel property, and\r\nsteadily pursued the policy of taking this kind of stock, until he became\r\na large ship owner as well as ship builder.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the mineral resources of the Lake Superior region\r\nattracted a large number of people to that locality, the only feasible\r\nmeans of communication with which was by lake. The Saut rapids prevented\r\nthe assent of vessels from the lower lakes, and to meet the requirements\r\nof the trade that suddenly sprung into existence two vessels were built on\r\nLake Superior, the freights being carried across the portage around the\r\nrapids. These vessels being insufficient for the needs, it became a\r\nquestion whether others could not be taken across the portage from below\r\nand launched on the waters of the upper lake. Messrs. Johnson & Tisdale\r\nthought it could be done, and took the contract for thus transporting the\r\nschooner Swallow and steamer Julia Palmer. They were hauled two miles on\r\ngreased slides or ways and safely launched on the bosom of the \"father of\r\nlakes.\" The undertaking was considered one of great difficulty, if not of\r\nabsolute impossibility, and its success gave Messrs. Johnson & Tisdale\r\nwidespread notoriety.\r\n\r\nWhen the first considerable fleet of Lake-built vessels left Cleveland for\r\nEuropean ports direct--as already described in this volume--Mr. Johnson\r\ntook one of his vessels, loaded with staves. She made a successful voyage,\r\nremained in Europe two years, engaged in the coasting trade, and then\r\nreturned. His strange looking craft attracted considerable attention among\r\nthe skippers of about forty sea-going vessels wind bound at the same time\r\nat the Land's End, and much ridicule was thrown on her odd looks, so\r\nunlike the English salt water shipping. But the laugh came in on the other\r\nside when her superior sailing qualities enabled her to run so close to\r\nthe wind as to quickly double the point, make her port, unload and reload,\r\nand sail for another voyage before one of the others could beat around the\r\nLand's End and get in. Since that time he has sold two vessels, the\r\nVanguard and Howell Hoppeck, to be placed by other parties in the direct\r\nline between Cleveland and Liverpool.\r\n\r\nMr. Johnson has taken considerable interest in matters outside of the\r\nship building business, but which aided in developing the trade and\r\nincreasing the prosperity of Cleveland. He aided in the formation of\r\nsome of the railroad enterprises of the city although he has now\r\nwithdrawn his interests from all but one. He also was interested in the\r\nCommercial Insurance Company, but has retired from active business and\r\ndevotes his whole care to the management of his property, which has been\r\nadded to by large investments in real estate in various portions of the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\nHe was married July 15, 1840, to Miss A. S. Norton of Middle Haddam, Conn.,\r\nthe native place of both, and by the marriage has had three children. The\r\noldest, a daughter, died when seven years old; the two sons are still\r\nliving, the oldest being engaged in the coffee and tea business in\r\nBuffalo, N. Y., with his father; the other at present being in North\r\nCarolina engaged in the lumber trade.\r\n\r\nWith commendable prudence Mr. Johnson has known when to quit active\r\nbusiness and enjoy the fruits of his labor while he has a healthy mind\r\nand body capable of enjoying it, and which, without accident, he\r\nundoubtedly will have for many years to come. Hard work and close\r\nattention to business have been the cause of his success, and hence he\r\nwill be able to appreciate the blessings of an ample competency. In\r\nsocial life Mr. Johnson is looked upon as a man of genial temperament,\r\nkindly disposition, and strong social qualities. He is universally\r\nrespected by all who know him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Quayle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names of Quayle and Martin are as familiar in the mouths of vessel men\r\non the lakes as household words. The firm attained honorable prominence in\r\nthe ship building records of Cleveland, and their work is among the best\r\nthat floats upon the western waters.\r\n\r\nThomas Quayle, the senior member of the firm of Quayle & Martin, was born\r\nin the Isle of Man, May 9th, 1811, and came to America in 1827, coming\r\nstraight to Cleveland, where he has remained ever since. He learned his\r\ntrade of ship building from Mr. Church, of Huron, Ohio, who enjoyed an\r\nexcellent reputation in that line. After working as journeyman till 1847,\r\nhe formed a copartnership with John Codey, and at once started business.\r\nThis firm lasted about three years, during which time, among other work,\r\nthey built a vessel named the Caroline, and another, the Shakespeare. When\r\nthe last named was completed, the California fever had just broken out.\r\nMr. Codey caught the disease, the firm dissolved, and he went off to the\r\nland of gold. Mr. Quayle soon after associated himself with Luther Moses,\r\nwith whom he did business for about two years, during which time they did\r\nan almost incredible amount of business, considering the short space of\r\ntime, having from six to seven vessels on the stocks at once, and turning\r\nout two sets a year. One year after Mr. Moses left the firm a\r\ncopartnership was formed with John Martin.\r\n\r\nThe new firm at once went into business on a large scale. From the time of\r\ntheir organization to the present, the firm built seventy-two vessels,\r\ncomprising brigs, schooners, barques, tugs, and propellers. In one year\r\nthey built thirteen vessels, and eight vessels, complete, in a year has\r\nbeen no unfrequent task successfully performed. Among others, they built\r\nthe barque W. T. Graves, which carried the largest cargo of any fresh water\r\nvessel afloat. The propeller Dean Richmond is another of their build, and\r\nis also one of the largest on the lakes; besides these, four first class\r\nvessels built for Mr. Frank Perew, deserve mention as giving character to\r\nCleveland ship building. They are named the Mary E. Perew, D. P. Dobbin,\r\nChandler J. Wells, and J. G. Marston. Besides the building of vessels, they\r\nhave for some years been owners of vessels, and are at present interested\r\nin several large craft. The firm of Quayle & Martin recently finished a\r\nnew tug of their own, the J. H. Martin intended to be used by them in the\r\nport of Erie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Respectfully, Thomas Quayle]\r\n\r\nMr. Quayle was married in 1835, to Eleanor Cannon, of the Isle of Man, by\r\nwhom he has had eleven children, of whom seven are living. The eldest son,\r\nThomas, is ship builder by trade, and is still connected with the vessel\r\ninterests, though not building them. W. H. is also of the same trade as his\r\nfather, and engaged with him, as is also Geo. L. Chas. E. has been a\r\nnumber of years with Alcott & Horton.\r\n\r\nMr. Quayle stands high among the citizens of Cleveland for integrity and\r\nsterling character generally. He always fulfills his obligations, whether\r\nto employer or employed. He has worked hard with his own hands, and given\r\npersonal supervision to all his work, believing that the eye of the master\r\nand the hand of the workman combined assure good work. He is strict in\r\nfulfilling all his contracts, and in this way has acquired a fine\r\nreputation and a handsome fortune. But that point has not been reached\r\nwithout a severe and continuous struggle against adverse circumstances,\r\nwhich were overcome only by a determined will and patient labor that\r\nconquered all.\r\n\r\nMr. Quayle's first wife died in September, 1860. He was married again\r\nFebruary 8th, 1867, to Miss Mary Proudfoot, of this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElihu M. Peck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of the ship builders who have assisted greatly in building up the\r\ncommerce and reputation of the port of Cleveland, is Elihu M. Peck. The\r\nvessels built by him, or by the firm of Peck & Masters, which existed\r\nabout nine years, are known over the lakes. A large proportion of the work\r\ndone, especially in the later years, was in the construction of\r\npropellers, of which several of the finest specimens afloat were made in\r\nthat yard.\r\n\r\nMr. Peck was born in Otsego county, New York, in 1822, and on reaching his\r\nsixteenth year, came west and learned the art of ship building in this\r\nvicinity. On completing his education in this business, he worked for a\r\ntime as a journeyman. In 1847, he set up for himself, and his first work\r\nwas the construction of the schooner Jenny Lind, of 200 tons. When she was\r\nfinished he ceased building new vessels for some years, and turned his\r\nattention exclusively to the repair of old vessels, at which he found\r\nabundant occupation. His yard was always busy, for the growing lake marine\r\ndemanded a large and steadily increasing amount of annual repairs.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, a partnership was formed with I. U. Masters, and the new firm\r\nimmediately entered upon the construction of new vessels. The first craft\r\nlaunched from their stocks was the Ocean Wave, the first of a fleet of\r\nfifty built by the firm previous to its dissolution and the death of Mr.\r\nMasters. They form a fleet of which the builders had good reason to be\r\nproud, for a glance at their names will recall the whole history of the\r\nlake marine for the past fourteen years. What strides have been made in\r\nthe improvement of the lake marine is plainly shown by the increase in the\r\ntonnage of the vessels built, whilst to those familiar with the lake\r\ntrade, the names will call up recollections of the crafts that will give a\r\nyet better idea of the progress made.\r\n\r\nThe barque Ocean Wave, the first built by the new firm, was followed by\r\nthe Julia Dean, of 460 tons. These were followed in rapid succession by\r\nthe Kenosha, schooner Iowa, 370 tons, barque B. S. Shephard, 500 tons,\r\nschooners Ralph Campbell, 240 tons, A. H. Stevens, 240 tons, David Tod, 460\r\ntons, and Ellen Williams, 380 tons; barque De Soto, 570 tons; schooners\r\nJohn S. Newhouse, 370 tons, W. B. Castle, 230 tons, Baltic, 360 tons,\r\nMidnight, 370 tons, and J. T. Ayer, 380 tons. At this time they undertook\r\nthe construction of propellers, and the first two built were at once\r\nremarked for their correct proportions, beauty of finish, and strength of\r\nhull. They were the Evergreen City, 612 tons, and the Fountain City, 820\r\ntons. The schooner Ellen White, 160 tons, was built, and then the firm\r\nresumed work on propellers. The Cornet, 624 tons, and Rocket of the same\r\nsize, were built and put into the railroad line running from Buffalo\r\nwestward. These were models of beauty and strength. Next came the\r\nschooners Metropolis, 360 tons, Mary B. Hale, 360 tons, and E. M. Peck, 168\r\ntons; barque Colorado, 503 tons; propeller Detroit, 398 tons; barques\r\nUnadilla, 567 tons, C. P. Sherman, 568 tons, Sunrise, 598 tons, Golden\r\nFleece, 609 tons, and Northwest, 630 tons; tugs W. B. Castle, 219 tons and\r\nI. U. Masters, 203 tons; barque S. V. R. Watson, 678 tons; propeller\r\nToledo, 621 tons; tug Hector, 204 tons; propellers Winslow, 920 tons,\r\nIdaho, 920 tons, Atlantic, 660 tons, Meteor, 730 tons, Pewabic, 730 tons,\r\nMetamora, 300 tons, and Octavia, 450 tons. This ended the operations of\r\nthe firm of Peck & Masters, in 1864. The firm was dissolved and Mr. Masters\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truly, E. M. Peck]\r\n\r\nMr. Peck now carried on his ship yard alone, and his first work was the\r\nfilling of a contract to build two steam Revenue cutters for service on\r\nthe lakes. The John Sherman, of 500 tons, and the A. P. Fessenden, of the\r\nsame size, were turned out, and no better work could possibly be found.\r\nThe Government officers promptly accepted the vessels and declared them\r\nmore than up to the requirements of the contract. They were pronounced\r\nmodels of beauty, strength, and speed.\r\n\r\nThe cutters were followed by the schooner Oak Leaf, 390 tons; propellers\r\nMessenger, 400 tons, and Nebraska, 1,300 tons, the latter, one of the\r\nfinest steamers put on the lakes; schooner David Stewart, 675 tons;\r\npropellers Manistee, 400 tons, and City of Concord, 400 tons. Two other\r\npropellers, one of 1,000 tons, and one of about 300 tons, were added in\r\nthe season of 1869.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that nearly all the vessels, whether sail or steam, built\r\nby Mr. Peck, were of the first class, being mainly barques and large\r\npropellers. They will be recognized by those familiar with lake commerce,\r\nas models in size, beauty, and strength, whilst several have made\r\nunusually quick trips.\r\n\r\nMr. Peck has enjoyed an unusual measure of success. The work of his hands\r\nhas prospered, and he has earned his reward, not only in reputation but in\r\nsubstantial prosperity. He has aimed not only to equal the best work done\r\nby others, but studied how to improve on his own work. The result has been\r\na constant improvement in the style and quality of his vessels, so that\r\nexcellent as the last new hull may have been, it was almost sure to be\r\nexcelled by the next one that left the stocks. And whilst thus giving\r\nclose attention to the mechanical details of his business, he was skillful\r\nin managing the financial part of it so as to secure the rewards honestly\r\nwon by industry and skill. He always kept his affairs in such order that\r\nno serious financial difficulty ever troubled him.\r\n\r\nNor was he an avaricious, though a prudent man. A working man himself, he\r\nwas in thorough sympathy with his workmen, and in the slack season,\r\ninstead of discharging his men and thus entailing want upon them, he built\r\nvessels on speculation, merely that he might keep the men busy and their\r\nfamilies from suffering. Providentially these speculations were always\r\nsuccessful, thus illustrating the proverb, that \"there is he that\r\nscattereth, and yet increaseth.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Peck took an active part in the formation of the People's Gas Light\r\nCompany, and is now president of that organization. He is also a director\r\nof the Savings Loan Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Martin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Martin, of the firm of Quayle & Martin, was born in the county of\r\nAntrim, Ireland, December 15th, 1824, of poor parents, with whom he came\r\nto Canada when but nine years of age. At the age of fourteen he commenced\r\nworking in a ship yard in Montreal, by turning grindstone. He soon\r\nattracted the attention of the proprietor by his using handily the tools\r\nof the workmen while they were at dinner, and he was furnished tools and\r\nset to work at the trade. He continued in this employ for about two years,\r\nand during the time, with a view to fitting himself for the business of\r\nlife, he attended school in the evenings. He then worked his passage to\r\nFrench Creek, New York, having at the time of leaving only a dollar and a\r\nhalf in money. At French Creek he engaged with G. S. Weeks, one of the best\r\nship builders on the lakes, and remained with him at French Creek two\r\nyears, when Mr. Weeks moved to Oswego, Mr. Martin accompanying him to that\r\nplace, and continuing in his employ two years longer. Mr. Martin then went\r\nto Detroit, where he worked a year on the steamboat Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, he came to Cleveland and commenced work for G. W. Jones, on the\r\nsteamboat Empire. This work finished, he commenced sub-contracting,\r\nwrecking, planking, and jobbing generally, until 1846, when he went into\r\nthe employ of another firm, with whom he worked two years.\r\n\r\nAt the end of that time his employers were owing him more than they could\r\npay, so, to square the matter, he bought an interest in their business.\r\nBut this did not mend the matter, as it proved to be an interest in their\r\ndebts, more than in their business, they being deeply involved. The firm\r\nowned the brig Courtland, and one of the members had sailed her for some\r\ntime at a great loss. Young Martin took his place and proved himself\r\nmaster of the situation, by reducing the liabilities of the firm to about\r\n$2,500. That done he sold the vessel, dissolved partnership, and commenced\r\nplanking and general jobbing again. After a time he built a vessel for\r\nMoses & Quayle. He found frequent employment in wrecking jobs, being very\r\nsuccessful at such work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly, John Martin]\r\n\r\nThe three years thus occupied gave him a start in life. He cleared off\r\nthe indebtedness of the old firm and had $3,000 ahead. He then took the\r\ncontract for building the brig John G. Deshler, for Handy, Warren & Co.\r\nThis was a very successful contract, and gave Mr. Martin a handsome lift,\r\nand enabled him to take an interest with Mr. Quayle, under the firm name\r\nof Quayle & Martin, a brief mention of its operations being made in the\r\nsketch of Mr. Quayle's life.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Mr. Martin loaded the John G. Deshler and D. C. Pierce with staves\r\nand made a successful trip to England, and on the return brought one of\r\nthe spans for the Victoria bridge at Montreal. In 1859, he took over two\r\nmore cargoes in the same vessels, selling one in Cork, and the other in\r\nGlasgow. Nor was this the only connection of the firm with the direct lake\r\nand ocean trade. They have built vessels for Liverpool parties, for ocean\r\nservice, and also two vessels for New York parties for the same purpose.\r\nSix of these vessels have also been sold out of the lake service for ocean\r\nnavigation, and have been used on the ocean for five or six years with\r\ngreat success. The John G. Deshler, which had been transferred to the\r\nocean, as previously mentioned, was sunk by the rebels at the outbreak of\r\nthe war, and was a total loss to the firm. The latest work of the firm is\r\na fine vessel for A. Bradley, that will carry a thousand tons of iron ore.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin has proved himself admirably adapted to the line of business it\r\nwas his fortune to learn, and this, of course, together with close\r\nattention to business, furnishes the clue to his success. He is\r\nemphatically a self-made man, and can therefore appreciate the handsome\r\ncompetence that has crowned his labors so early in life, he being now but\r\n45 years of age.\r\n\r\nDuring the war Mr. Martin was actively and earnestly on the side of the\r\nGovernment. He was never idle, and always ready to furnish his share, and\r\nfar more than his share, to the work of suppressing the rebellion. He\r\nfurnished three substitutes for the army, and was active in promoting\r\nvolunteering.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin was married to Miss Mary Picket, of Devonshire, England, whose\r\nfather and grandfather were both Episcopal clergymen. Three children were\r\nborn of this marriage; a son, who is now book-keeper for the firm, and two\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin has enjoyed the confidence of his neighbors to so high a\r\ndegree, that he has represented the Ninth Ward in the City Council for six\r\nsuccessive years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bench and Bar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leading points in the history of legal affairs in Cleveland have\r\nalready been noticed with sufficient fullness in the sketch of the\r\nhistory of Cleveland, especially so far as relates more immediately to\r\nthe earlier portion of that history. The following biographical sketches\r\ngive a good general idea of the progress of affairs in relation to the\r\nBench and Bar of the city within the active life of the present\r\ngeneration. It is therefore unnecessary at this place to detail more than\r\na few incidental facts.\r\n\r\nThe township of Cleveland, of the county of Trumbull, was organized in\r\n1800. The first justice of the Quorum, for the new township, was James\r\nKingsbury, and the first Justice, not of the Quorum, was Amos Spafford.\r\nThe first constables were Stephen Gilbert and Lorenzo Carter.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, the county of Cuyahoga was organized and Cleveland made the\r\ncounty seat. The court-house, of logs, was two years afterwards built on\r\nthe Public Square, as narrated in previuos portions of this work. The\r\ncounty was organized on the 9th May, and on 5th of June a County Court was\r\nheld with the following officers:\r\n\r\n  _Presiding Judge_.--Benjamin Ruggles\r\n  _Associate Judges_.--Nathan Perry, Sen., Augustus Gilbert, Timothy Doan.\r\n  _Clerk_.--John Walworth.\r\n  _Sheriff_.--Smith S. Baldwin.\r\n\r\nThe first lawyer in Cleveland, under the county organization, arrived here\r\nthe same year and put out his shingle with the name of \"Alfred Kelley\"\r\ninscribed thereon. Previous to this the law business had all been done by\r\nSamuel Huntington, who arrived in 1801. At the time of the organization of\r\nthe court, the court-house had not been built, and the first session was\r\nheld in Murray's store, which had just been built. The first business was\r\nthe finding of a bill by the grand jury for petit larceny, and several for\r\nthe offence of selling whisky to Indians, and selling foreign goods\r\nwithout license.\r\n\r\nThe first execution was that of the Indian Omic, which took place June\r\n24th, 1812, as previously narrated.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1836, Cleveland was incorporated as a city, and henceforth to\r\nthe ordinary courts of the county was added a city court for cognizance of\r\noffences against the ordinances.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1848, a Superior Court was organized, with Sherlock J. Andrew\r\nas judge, and G. A. Benedict as clerk. This court existed but a short time,\r\nwhen it expired by reason of the adoption of the new constitution of the\r\nState, which made no provision for its continuance.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, Cleveland was selected as the seat of a District and Circuit\r\nCourt of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of curiosity, the following list of Attorneys and Counsellors\r\nin Cleveland, in 1837, is taken from McCabe's Cleveland and Ohio City\r\nDirectory, those not practising at that time being marked with an\r\nasterisk: Joseph Adams, John W. Allen, Sherlock J. Andrews, Oliver P.\r\nBaldwin, John Barr, Phillip Battell, George A. Benedict, Henry W.\r\nBillings, Elijah Bingham,* Flavius Bingham, Thomas Bolton, James A.\r\nBriggs, Varnum J. Card, Leonard Case,* Richard M. Chapman, Alexander L.\r\nCollins, James L. Conger, Samuel Cowles,* Henry H. Dodge, John Erwin,\r\nSimeon Ford, John A. Foot, James K. Hitchcock, George Hoadly, James M.\r\nHoyt, Seth T. Hurd, Moses Kelley, George T. Kingsley, William B. Lloyd,\r\nGeorge W. Lynde, Samuel Mather, Daniel Parish, Henry B. Payne, Francis\r\nRandal, Harvey Rice, O. S. St. John, Wyllys Silliman, George W. Stanley,\r\nSamuel Starkweather, John M. Sterling,* Charles Stetson, Charles\r\nWhittlesey, Frederick Whittlesey,* John W. Willey,* Samuel Williamson,\r\nHiram V. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alfred Kelley]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfred Kelley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlfred Kelley was born at Middletown, Conn., Nov. 7th, 1789. He was the\r\nsecond son of Daniel and Jemima Kelley. His mother's maiden name was Stow.\r\nShe was a sister of Judge Joshua Stow, and also of Judge Silas Stow of\r\nLowville, N. Y. The latter was the father of Judge Horatio Stow, of\r\nBuffalo, N. Y., and of Alexander Stow, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court\r\nof Wisconsin, both of whom were men of great talents and distinction. In\r\nthe winter of 1798, Alfred Kelley removed with his father's family to\r\nLowville, N. Y. His father was President Judge of the Court of Common\r\nPleas of Lewis county, N. Y., was one of the founders of Lowville Academy\r\nand President of its Board of Trustees.\r\n\r\nAlfred Kelley was educated at Fairfield Academy, N. Y. He read law at\r\nWhitesboro, N. Y., three years, in the office of Jonas Platt, a judge of\r\nthe Supreme Court of that State.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1810, in company with Joshua Stow, Dr. J. P. Kirtland, and\r\nothers, he removed to Cleveland,--traveling on horseback. At the November\r\nterm 1810, on motion of Peter Hitchcock, Alfred Kelley was admitted as an\r\nattorney of the Court of Common Pleas for Cuyahoga county. On the same\r\nday, being his 21st birth day, he was appointed Public Prosecutor as the\r\nsuccessor of Peter Hitchcock, late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of\r\nOhio. Mr. Kelley continued Prosecutor till 1821, when he resigned. In\r\nOctober 1814, he was elected from Cuyahoga county a member of the Ohio\r\nHouse of Representatives, being barely old enough under the Constitution\r\nwhen the Legislature met to take his seat in that body and being the\r\nyoungest member. Chillicothe was then the temporary State capital.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of August, 1817. Alfred Kelley was married to Mary S. Welles,\r\noldest daughter of Major Melancthon Wolsey Welles, of Lowville, N. Y.\r\nThey had eleven children of whom six are now living.\r\n\r\nHe continued, with intervals, a member of the Ohio Legislature from\r\nCuyahoga county, from 1814 until 1822, when he was appointed, with\r\nothers, State Canal Commissioner, by an act of the General Assembly,\r\nempowering the Commissioners to make examinations, surveys and estimates,\r\nto ascertain the practicability of connecting Lake Erie with the Ohio\r\nRiver, by canal.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Canal is a monument to the enterprise, energy, integrity and\r\nsagacity of Alfred Kelley. He was acting Commissioner during its\r\nconstruction and the onerous and responsible service was performed with\r\nsuch fidelity and economy that the _actual cost did not exceed the\r\nestimate!_ The dimensions of the Ohio Canal were the same as those of the\r\nErie Canal of N. Y., but the number of locks was nearly double. The Erie\r\nCanal was 363 miles in length, its total cost was $7,143,789, and cost per\r\nmile $19,679. The Ohio Canal is 307 miles in length, its total cost was\r\n$4,695,824, and cost per mile $15,300, being less than that of any other\r\ncanal constructed on this continent. The Ohio Canal was finished about\r\n1830. The labor in the then facilities for conducting important public\r\nenterprises was Herculean, but Mr. Kelley's indomitable will, and iron\r\nconstitution and physique triumphed over all difficulties. Mr. Kelley\r\nneither charged nor received any pay for his first year's services in\r\nsuperintending the preliminary explorations and surveys for the Ohio\r\nCanal. The pay of the Acting Canal Commissioner was $3,00 [sic] per day.\r\nWhen the work was done he resigned as Canal Commissioner, and retired from\r\npublic service to attend to his private affairs, and recuperate his\r\nshattered constitution and health. In the Fall of 1830, he became a\r\nresident of Columbus. In October, 1836, he was elected to the Ohio House\r\nof Representatives from Franklin county, and was re-elected to the same\r\noffice in the next two Legislatures. He was Chairman of the Ohio Whig\r\nState Central Committee in 1840, a year distinguished for a great\r\npolitical revolution and the election of Wm. H. Harrison to the\r\nPresidency, and was one of the most active and influential managers of\r\nthat campaign.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelley was appointed State Fund Commissioner in 1840, a period of\r\ngreat financial embarrassment and distress. In 1841 and '42, a formidable\r\nparty arose in the Legislature and in the State, which advocated the\r\nnon-payment of the maturing interest upon the State debt, and the\r\nrepudiation of the debt itself. This was a time which indeed tried the\r\nsouls of men. Mr. Kelley went to New York, and such was the confidence\r\nreposed in his integrity and practical ability--notwithstanding the\r\nunderhanded and atrocious means employed by the repudiators, to defeat his\r\nobject--that he was enabled to raise in that city (where no one could be\r\nfound willing to loan money to the sovereign State of Ohio) nearly a\r\nquarter of a million of dollars on his own personal security, and thus by\r\nhis generous efforts, and by his alone, the interest was paid at maturity,\r\nand the State of Ohio was saved from repudiation. At the time that Mr.\r\nKelley thus volunteered himself as security for the State, (an act which\r\nwas done contrary to the advice of his friends,) such was the\r\nunenlightened state of public opinion, such the moral obtuseness of some,\r\nnay, many men in power, that the chances were a hundred to one that no\r\neffective measure would be adopted to save the public credit--none to\r\nindemnify him.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, he was elected to the State Senate from the Franklin district. It\r\nwas during this term that he originated the bill to organize the State\r\nBank of Ohio, and other banking companies, which by general consent among\r\nbankers and financiers, was the best of American banking laws. His banking\r\nSystem was successfully in operation during the whole twenty years of its\r\ncharter. Many of the most valuable provisions of the present National\r\nbanking law were taken from Mr. Kelley's bill to \"organize the State Bank\r\nof Ohio.\" Many of the provisions of this law were original and novel, and\r\nevinced deep thought and a profound knowledge of this department of\r\npolitical science. For several years, and during some of the most trying\r\nperiods in the financial history of Ohio, and of the country, Mr. Kelley\r\nwas a member of the Board of Control of the State Bank of Ohio; and part\r\nof the time was President of the Board. It was also during this Senatorial\r\nterm that Mr. Kelley originated the present Revenue System of the State.\r\nThe main principles of this Revenue or Tax law were subsequently\r\nincorporated in the new Constitution of Ohio.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Kelley was a member of the Legislature few valuable general laws\r\ncan be found in the Statute books which did not originate with him, and\r\nmost of the measures requiring laborious investigation and profound\r\nthought were entrusted to him. He was the author, in 1818, of the first\r\nLegislative bill--either in this country or in Europe--to abolish\r\nimprisonment for debt.\r\n\r\nIt then failed to become a law. In a letter to a friend, dated Jan. 16th,\r\n1819, Mr. Kelley said: \"The House has to-day disagreed by a small\r\nmajority, to my favorite bill to abolish imprisonment for debt. I was not\r\ndisappointed, although at first, a large majority seemed in favor of it.\r\nThe time will come when the absurdity as well as inhumanity of adding\r\noppression to misfortune will be acknowledged; and if I should live to see\r\nthat day I shall exult in the consciousness of having early combatted one\r\nof the worst prejudices of the age.\" In 1831, the Legislature of New York\r\npassed the first law abolishing imprisonment for debt.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this Senatorial term he was elected President of the\r\nColumbus & Xenia Railroad Company, and was actively engaged upon all\r\nthe duties of that enterprise until it was finished; soon after which\r\nhe resigned. While this road was in progress, upon the urgent\r\nsolicitation of the active promoters of the C., C. & C. R. R., Mr. Kelley\r\naccepted the Presidency of that Company, and began the work with his\r\nusual order and ability.\r\n\r\nHis zeal and labors upon this enterprise were only surpassed in his work\r\nupon the Ohio Canal. He solicited subscriptions to the capital stock;\r\nlocated much of the route; procured rights of way; attended in person to\r\nthe purchase of materials; the procuring of money, and the details of the\r\nconstruction of the road, and continued the ever working president of the\r\nroad until he resigned, a short time after its completion. With his own\r\nhands he dug the first shovel of earth, and laid the last rail upon this\r\nroad. It is but just to say, that the citizens of Cleveland and the people\r\nof Ohio are more indebted to Alfred Kelley than to any other man for the\r\nC., C. & C. R. R. He was still acting president of the C. & X. and the\r\nC., C. & C. Companies, when he was chosen, in 1850, president of the\r\nC., P. & A., or Lake Shore R. R. Company. He was actively engaged upon\r\nthis road in the performance of duties similar to those done upon the\r\nC., C. & C. road until its completion in 1853, when he resigned. It was\r\nwhile he was president of this road that the famous riots occurred at\r\nErie and Harbor Creek, Pa., in opposition to the construction of the road\r\nthrough Pennsylvania. The success of the company in this formidable\r\ncontest was largely due to the sagacity, forbearance and indomitable will\r\nof Alfred Kelley. When he took charge of these railroads, such enterprises\r\nat the West had but little credit at the East. The roads constructed by\r\nhim have paid regular dividends from the time of their completion. He\r\ncontinued until his death an active director in these companies.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1857, he was again elected to the State Senate from Columbus,\r\nbeing then 64 years of age, and the oldest member of the Legislature. This\r\nwas his last appearance in public life. During the last year of this\r\nservice his health was declining. Although so much debilitated that\r\nprudence required confinement to his house, if not to his bed, yet such\r\nwas his fidelity to his trust, that he went daily to the Senate and\r\ncarried through the Legislature several important measures to ascertain\r\nthe true condition of the State Treasury, and to secure the public funds\r\nfrom further depredations.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this term he retired from public life hoping to regain his\r\nhealth; but his constitution was too much broken to admit of\r\nre-establishment. He did not appear to be affected with any specific\r\ndisease, but seemed gradually wasting away from an over-taxed mind and\r\nbody. His oft quoted maxim was, \"It is better to wear out than to rust\r\nout.\" He was only confined to his room a few days previous to his death,\r\nand on Friday, the 2d day of December, 1863, his pure spirit left its\r\nearthly tenement so gently that the friends who surrounded him could\r\nscarcely determine when it ascended. Mr. Kelley was twenty-four years in\r\nthe service of the people of Ohio, in the Legislature, and as Canal\r\nCommissioner, and Fund Commissioner. His history would be almost a\r\ncomplete financial and political history of Ohio. He gave a greater\r\nimpulse to the physical development of Ohio, and left upon its statute\r\nbooks higher proofs of wisdom and forecast than any who had preceded him.\r\nIndeed, few persons have ever lived who, merely by personal exertions,\r\nhave left behind them more numerous and lasting monuments of patient and\r\nuseful labor.\r\n\r\nNote.--For much of this sketch we are indebted to an unpublished \"Memoir\r\nof Alfred Kelley,\" by the late Judge Gustavus Swan, of Columbus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLeonard Case\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe late Leonard Case was the second child and oldest son of Magdalene and\r\nMesech Case, of Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania. His mother, who was a\r\nnative of Winchester, Virginia, was of German extraction, her maiden name\r\nbeing Extene. His father, believed to have been of English ancestry, was\r\nborn in Sussex county, New Jersey. For nearly forty years Mr. Mesech Case\r\nsuffered from asthma to the extent of making him a partial invalid, and\r\nhence much of the management of his affairs devolved upon his wife, a\r\nwoman of superior character, educated beyond the average of those days,\r\nenergetic, having good executive ability, and blessed with robust health.\r\nThe family cultivated a small farm in Pennsylvania, which yielded but a\r\nmoderate support, so that when news came of the land of rich promise\r\nbeyond the mountains, where the soil yielded with an abundance marvellous\r\nin the eyes of those who painfully cultivated and carefully gathered in\r\nthe older States, they collected their implements and stock, packed their\r\nhousehold effects, disposed of the farm, and, crossing the mountains,\r\nsettled down somewhere between the western foot of the Alleghanies and\r\nPittsburgh. This, however, was not the land of promise. The reports they\r\nhad heard in their Westmoreland home of the soil which produced crops\r\nalmost without care, and which embarrassed by their abundant yield, came\r\nfrom still farther west, and again the Case household took up the line of\r\nmarch, settling down finally upon a farm of two hundred acres near Warren,\r\nTrumbull county, Ohio, in the year 1800.\r\n\r\nThere were then five children in the Case household, Leonard, the oldest\r\nson, and the subject of this biographical sketch, being then sixteen years\r\nold, having been born in Westmoreland county, Penn., July 20th, 1784. In\r\nthe invalid condition of his father, and being the oldest son of the\r\nfamily, young Leonard was compelled to take a prominent part in the\r\nmanagement of the affairs of the farm. In the Spring succeeding the\r\nremoval to Trumbull, he started out in search of working oxen needed for\r\nthe Spring work. The task was a difficult one, and he traveled for some\r\ntime, becoming much heated with the walk and the anxiety. On his return he\r\nhad to cross a stream several times whilst he was in this heated\r\ncondition, the result being the contracting of a severe cold which settled\r\nin his limbs and brought on an inflammation that confined him to his bed\r\nfor months.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the Fall of 1801, when he recovered sufficiently to arise\r\nfrom his bed. But he arose as a cripple. The injury he had received from\r\nhis unfortunate journey was permanent, and he was unable for some time\r\nafter his rising from a sick bed to walk, or even to stand. Thus helpless\r\nin body, whilst active in mind, he pondered over his future. As a farmer\r\nhe was no longer of any use, and unless some other mode of livelihood was\r\nadopted he must remain a dependent on his relations. This was galling his\r\nindependent nature, and he determined to avoid it if possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I am Respectfully Leonard Case]\r\n\r\nHis hands were free if his feet gave promise of but little usefulness. He\r\nconcluded that the pen would be a fitter implement for his purposes than\r\nthe plow, and he took measures accordingly. Whilst lying in bed, unable to\r\nrise, he had a board fastened before him in such a manner as to serve for\r\na desk. With this contrivance he worked diligently, whilst lying otherwise\r\nhelpless, to acquire the rudiments of knowledge. He learned to write and\r\ncipher with moderate ease and correctness, and when he had matured the\r\ncontents of an arithmetical text book, which was the property of his\r\nmother, he borrowed a few works on the higher branches of mathematics from\r\nsome surveyors in the neighborhood. From the knowledge in this way\r\nacquired, he conceived the desire to be a surveyor and he set to work\r\nenergetically to perfect himself in that science so far as it could be\r\ndone by books. He was embarrassed by the want of even the most simple\r\ninstruments. A semi-circle for measuring angles was made by cutting a\r\ngroove the required shape on a piece of soft wood, and filling it by\r\nmelting and running in a pewter spoon, making an arc of metal on which the\r\ngraduated scale was etched. A pair of dividers was improvised from a piece\r\nof hickory, by making the centre thin, bending it over, putting pins at\r\nthe points, and regulating its spread by twisting a cord.\r\n\r\nBut more education was needed, and if he expected to pursue the path he\r\nhad marked out in his mind, he must leave his home and venture out in the\r\nworld. To do this, money was needed, for to a cripple like him the first\r\nstruggle in the battle of life would be almost hopeless, if he entered on\r\nit totally without resources. As seen, he had already manifested a strong\r\nmechanical bent. He was domestic carpenter, making and repairing such\r\narticles as were needed in the household. This ability he immediately\r\ncommenced to turn to account. A rude chair suitable to his needs was\r\nmounted on wheels, and in this he was able to reach the edge of the woods\r\nsurrounding the house, where he cut twigs and made baskets, which were\r\npurchased by the neighbors. Other jobs requiring mechanical skill were\r\ndone by him for the neighborhood, and in this way a small fund was\r\ngradually accumulated with which to make his meditated start in life.\r\n\r\nIn 1806, he was able to set out from home and reach the village of\r\nWarren, where he concluded that a better opportunity existed for\r\nobtaining work with his pen. He found employment as clerk in the Land\r\nCommissioner's office, where his industry, zeal, and strong desire to\r\nimprove both his knowledge and opportunities, soon brought him into\r\nnotice and gained for him many valuable friends. Chief among these was\r\nMr. John D. Edwards, a lawyer, holding the office of recorder of Trumbull\r\ncounty, which then comprised all the Western Reserve. Mr. Edwards proved\r\na fast friend to Mr. Case, and his memory was ever held in respect by the\r\nlatter. He advised the young clerk to add a knowledge of law to his\r\nother acquirements, and furnished him with books with which to prosecute\r\nhis studies, until he was at length admitted to the bar. In addition, he\r\ngave him such writing as fell in his way to be given out, and thus aided\r\nin enabling him to support himself.\r\n\r\nThe war of 1812 found Mr. Case at Warren, having, among his other duties,\r\nthat of the collection of non-resident taxes on the Western Reserve, for\r\nwhich he had to furnish what was then considered heavy bail. Having to go\r\nto Chillicothe to make his settlement, he prepared for the journey by\r\nmaking a careful disposition of all his official matters, so that in case\r\nof misfortune to him, there would be no difficulty in settling his\r\naffairs, and no loss to his bail. The money belonging to the several\r\ntownships was parcelled out, enveloped, and marked in readiness to hand\r\nover to the several trustees. The parcels were then deposited with his\r\nfriend, Mr. Edwards, with directions to pay over to the proper parties\r\nshould he not return in time. The journey was made without mishap, but on\r\nhis return Mr. Case found that his friend had set out to join the army on\r\nthe Maumee, and had died suddenly on the way. To the gratification of Mr.\r\nCase, however, the money was found where he had left it, untouched.\r\n\r\nIn 1816, Mr. Case received the appointment of cashier of the Commercial\r\nBank of Lake Erie, just organized in Cleveland. He immediately removed to\r\nCleveland and entered on the discharge of his duties. These did not occupy\r\nthe whole of his time, so with the avocations of a banker he coupled the\r\npractice of law and also the business of land agent. The bank, in common\r\nwith most of the similar institutions of the time, was compelled to\r\nsuspend operations, but was revived in after years with Mr. Case as\r\npresident. Of those who were connected as officers with the original\r\norganization, Mr. Case gave the least promise of a long life, but yet he\r\noutlived all his colleagues.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the bank he devoted himself more earnestly to the\r\npractice of the law and the prosecution of his business as a land agent.\r\nThe active practice of the law was abandoned in 1834, but the land agency\r\nwas continued until a comparatively recent period, when his infirmities,\r\nand the care of his own estate, grown into large proportions, rendered it\r\nnecessary for him to decline all business for others.\r\n\r\nMr. Case had a natural taste for the investigation of land titles and\r\nstudying the history of the earlier land owners. His business as a land\r\nagent gave him scope for the gratification of this taste, and his\r\nappointment as agent for the management of the Western Reserve school\r\nlands, enabled him still further to prosecute his researches, whilst his\r\nstrong memory retained the facts acquired until he became complete\r\nmaster of the whole history of the titles derived from the Connecticut\r\nLand Company.\r\n\r\nFrom his earliest connection with Cleveland, Mr. Case took a lively\r\ninterest in the affairs of the village, the improvement of the streets,\r\nmaintenance and enlargement of the schools, and the extension of religious\r\ninfluences. For all these purposes he contributed liberally, and spent\r\nmuch time and labor. To his thoughtfulness and public spirit are due the\r\ncommencement of the work of planting shade trees on the streets, which has\r\nadded so much to the beauty of the city, and has won for it the cognomen\r\nof the Forest City. From 1821 to 1825, he was president of the village,\r\nand was judicious and energetic in the management of its affairs. On the\r\nerection of Cuyahoga county, he was its first auditor. He was subsequently\r\nsent to the State Legislature, where he distinguished himself by his\r\npersistent labors in behalf of the Ohio canals. He headed the subscription\r\nto the stock of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad Company\r\nwith the sum of five thousand dollars, and became a director in the\r\nCompany. His good sense, a judgment that rarely erred, his extensive\r\nknowledge of the village and surrounding country, and the cheerful\r\nreadiness with which he gave counsel, whenever requested in good faith,\r\ncaused him to be the confidential adviser of the county and municipal\r\nofficials, after he had ceased to take an active part in public affairs.\r\n\r\nOne of the rules from which he never deviated, was in no case to contract\r\na debt beyond his ability to pay within two years without depending on a\r\nsale of property. In this way he was enabled to accumulate acre after acre\r\nin what has since proved to be valuable portions of the city, and thus to\r\nacquire a vast estate, which, in his later years, became steadily\r\nremunerative.\r\n\r\nMr. Case was a man of uncommon industry, of high integrity, and strong\r\ncommon sense. His manner to strangers, especially when interrupted in\r\nbusiness, was brusque, and gave an unfavorable impression to those\r\nunacquainted with his real character, which was uniformly cheerful and\r\nkind. As a seller of land, he was both just and generous, and from no one\r\never came the complaint of oppressive or ungenerous treatment. Although\r\nnot a member of any church organization, he had strong religious\r\ntendencies, of a liberal cast.\r\n\r\nMr. Case died December 7th, 1864, leaving one son, Leonard Case, the other\r\nson, William, having died a short time earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReuben Wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHonorable Reuben Wood, an early settler of Cleveland, was born in Rutland\r\ncounty, Vermont, in 1792. In early life he worked on a farm in Summer and\r\ntaught school in Winter. Resolving to achieve more than this, he went to\r\nCanada and studied the classics under the tuition of an English clergyman,\r\nand while there commenced the study of law with Hon. Barnabas Bidwell.\r\nWhen war was declared in 1812, young Wood, with all other resident\r\nAmericans were required to leave Canada. He then went to Middletown, Vt.,\r\nwhere he completed his legal studies in the office of Gen. Jonas Clark, an\r\neminent lawyer of that place.\r\n\r\nIn 1818, he married, and emigrated to Cleveland, where he arrived\r\nSeptember of that year, a stranger, and without money. He at once\r\nentered upon a successful practice, and soon became distinguished as a\r\nlawyer and advocate.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, he was elected a member of the State Senate, and was twice\r\nre-elected to the same position.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, he was elected President Judge of the Third Judicial Circuit.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, he was elected a Judge of the Supreme Court, and at the close of\r\nhis term was re-elected. For the last three years of his second term he\r\nwas Chief Justice. As a Judge he was noted for sound logic, and the\r\nclearness of his decisions.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Judge Wood was elected by the Democratic party Governor of the\r\nState by eleven thousand majority, and was re-elected Governor in 1851,\r\nunder the new constitution, by a majority of twenty-six thousand.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, he was appointed, by the Government, Consul to Valparaiso, South\r\nAmerica. While there, he, for some months, at the request of the\r\nGovernment, discharged the duties of a Minister Plenipotentiary to Chili.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Chili, he returned to his farm in Rockport, near\r\nCleveland, where he died, October 2, 1864, generally esteemed, and highly\r\nrespected by all who knew him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn W. Willey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn W. Willey was a native of New Hampshire, being born in 1797. He\r\npursued a regular course of study at Dartmouth College, under the\r\nencouragement of the distinguished President Wheelock, after whom he had\r\nbeen named. He studied law in New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, being then twenty-five years of age, he came West and settled in\r\nCleveland. At that time it had but one tavern, no church, no railroads, no\r\ncanal, an occasional steamboat only, three or four stores and a few\r\nhundred inhabitants; such was the then picture of a settlement now\r\napproaching to a city of a hundred thousand people. Small as Cleveland\r\nthen was, professionally, Mr. Willey had been preceded by men of decided\r\nability. Alfred Kelley, Leonard Case, and the late Gov. Wood, had taken\r\npossession of the field four, six and twelve years before him, and were\r\nmen of far more than ordinary ability. Mr. Willey was peculiarly adapted\r\nto such circumstances as these. Thoroughly versed in legal principles, of\r\na keen and penetrating mind, a logician by nature, fertile and ready of\r\nexpedient, with a persuasive eloquence, enlivened with wit and humor, he\r\nat once rose to prominence at the bar of Northern Ohio. The Cuyahoga bar\r\nwas for many years considered the strongest in the State, but amongst all\r\nof its talented members, each with his own peculiar forte, for the faculty\r\nof close and long-continued reasoning, clearness of statement, nice\r\ndiscrimination, and never ending ingenuity, he had no superior.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, Mr. Willey was partially withdrawn from practice, by being\r\nelected to the Legislature, where he served three years as Representative\r\nand three as Senator, until 1832.\r\n\r\nHe was the first Mayor of Cleveland, being elected in 1836, and re-elected\r\nin 1837, by large majorities, and prepared the original laws and\r\nordinances for the government of the city.\r\n\r\nHe was amongst the earliest projectors, prior to the reverses of 1836 and\r\n1837, of the railroads to Columbus and Cincinnati, and to Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, he was appointed to the bench, thus restoring him to those\r\nstudies and subjects of thought from which years of public and of\r\nbusiness life had diverted him. No sooner had he assumed this new position\r\nthan by common consent it was recognized as the one above all others he\r\nwas best fitted to adorn. Possessing the power which so few men have, of\r\nclose, concentrated, continuous thought, he was at the same time prompt in\r\nhis decisions. His instructions to juries, and his legal judgments,\r\nusually pronounced at considerable length, were marked by that precision\r\nof statement, clearness of analysis, and felicity of language, which made\r\nthem seem like the flowing of a silver stream.\r\n\r\nJudge Willey, at the time of his death, which occurred in June, 1841, was\r\nPresident Judge of the Fourteenth Judicial District. He died deeply\r\nregretted by a large circle of professional and other friends, who had\r\nbecome much attached to him for his many virtues, uniform and dignified,\r\nyet unostentatious life.\r\n\r\nIn the Western Law Journal for 1852, we find a judicial anecdote related\r\nof Mr. Willey, in illustration of his wit, and immovable self-possession.\r\nThe writer says: \"At his last term in Cleveland we happened in while he\r\nwas pronouncing sentence upon a number of criminals who had been\r\nconvicted during the week, of penitentiary offenses. One of them, a\r\nstubborn looking fellow, who, to the usual preliminary question of\r\nwhether he had anything to offer why the sentence of the law should not\r\nbe pronounced upon him, had replied somewhat truculently, that he had\r\n'nothing to say,' but who when the judge was proceeding in a few\r\nprefatory remarks to explain to the man how fairly he had been tried,\r\netc., broke in upon the court by exclaiming that 'he did'nt care if the\r\ncourt had convicted him, he wasn't guilty _any_ how.' 'That will be a\r\nconsolation to you,' rejoined the judge, with unusual benignity, and with\r\na voice full of sympathy and compassion, 'That will be a consolation to\r\nyou, in the hour of your confinement, for we read in the good Book that\r\nit is better to _suffer_ wrong, than _do_ wrong.' In the irrepressible\r\nburst of laughter which followed this unexpected response, all joined\r\nexcept the judge and the culprit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truly Yours, S. Andrews]\r\n\r\n\r\nSherlock J. Andrews.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Andrews was born November, 1801, in the quiet New England village\r\nof Wallingford, Connecticut. His father was a prominent physician at\r\nthat place, where he spent a long and useful life in the practice of\r\nhis profession. He lived to a good old age, a Christian gentleman of\r\nthe old school.\r\n\r\nAlthough Wallingford is but a short day's travel from Yale, even under the\r\nold System of horse and shay, or horse and saddle, young Andrews was sent\r\nout of New England to Union College, at Schenectady, New York, where he\r\ngraduated about the year 1821.\r\n\r\nSoon after this time the elder Silliman was at Wallingford, and being in\r\nneed of an assistant in Chemistry and a private secretary, he offered the\r\nposition to Mr. Andrews, which was accepted. It seems to have been\r\nmutually a happy relation. In his diary, Prof. Silliman says, \"he was a\r\nyoung man of a vigorous and active mind, energetic and quick in his\r\ndecisions and movements, with a warm heart and a genial temper, of the\r\nbest moral and social habits, a quiet and skillful penman, an agreeable\r\ninmate of my family, in which we made him quite at home. We found we had\r\nacquired an interesting and valuable friend as well as a good professional\r\nassistant. It is true he had, when he came, no experience in practical\r\nChemistry. He had everything to learn, but learned rapidly, as he had real\r\nindustry and love of knowledge. Before the end of the first term he proved\r\nthat we had made a happy choice. He continued about four years serving\r\nwith ability, and the zeal of an affectionate son, without whom I could\r\nscarce have retained my place in the College.\" During this experience in\r\nthe field of sciences, Mr. Andrews had pursued the study of the law at the\r\nLaw School of New Haven, with the same ardor, and in 1825, removed to\r\nCleveland, and established himself as an attorney.\r\n\r\nIn 1828, he married Miss Ursula Allen, of Litchfield, Connecticut,\r\ndaughter of the late John Allen, a member of Congress from that State, who\r\nwas also the father of Hon. John W. Allen, of this city. The late Samuel\r\nCowles had preceded Mr. Andrews here in the profession and offered him a\r\npartnership. Their competitors were the late Governor Wood and Judge John\r\nW. Willey, who were partners, and Judge Starkweather, who still survives.\r\nConsidering the limited business of the place, which scarcely numbered\r\nfive hundred inhabitants, the profession was evidently overstocked then,\r\nas it has been ever since. Briefless lawyers had, however, a wide field to\r\ncultivate outside this county, embracing at least all the counties of the\r\nReserve; with horse and saddle-bags, they followed the Court in its\r\ntravels, judges and attorneys splashing through the mud on terms of\r\ndemocratic equality.\r\n\r\nJudge Andrews gave immediate promise of celebrity as an advocate. With a\r\nsensitive and nervous temperament, he entered sympathetically into the\r\ncase of his client, making it his own. He possessed a brilliant readiness\r\nof manner, full of skillful thrusts, hits, and witticisms. His correct New\r\nEngland morals were not deteriorated by contact with the more loose codes\r\nof a new western town. In his clear and earnest voice there was that\r\nmagnetic influence, which is necessary to complete the style of any\r\norator, and which is a gift solely of nature. As a technical pleader,\r\nthough he stood high, there were others upon the circuit equally gifted.\r\nBut in a cause where his convictions of justice and of legal right were\r\nfixed, there was not among his contemporaries, in the courts of this\r\nState, an advocate, whose efforts were so nearly irresistible before a\r\njury. He has command of sarcasm and invective, without coarseness. He\r\nattacks oppression, meanness and fraud as if they were offences not only\r\nagainst the public, but against himself. He has never strayed from the\r\nprofession to engage in any speculations or occupations to divert his\r\nthoughts from pure law, except for two years from 1840, while he held a\r\nseat in Congress. In 1848, the Legislature elected him judge of the\r\nSuperior Court of Cuyahoga county, a place he continued to hold till the\r\nCourt was abolished. As a judge he was eminently successful, his decisions\r\nhaving been overruled by higher courts only in a single instance, and that\r\nowing to a clerical mistake. In politics he was evidently not at home.\r\nAfter leaving the bench, Judge Andrews returned to the practice, but has\r\nbeen chiefly employed as associate counsel, occasionally addressing juries\r\non important cases.\r\n\r\nAs an advocate, Judge Andrews, during his whole professional career, has\r\nbeen in the very foremost rank, with a reputation confined neither to\r\ncounty, or even State lines. Distinguished for clear conceptions of legal\r\nprinciples, and their varied relations to practical life, he has also\r\nshown rare ability in judging of mixed questions of law and fact. His\r\nlegal opinions, therefore, have ever been held in the highest esteem.\r\n\r\nBut as jury lawyer, Judge Andrews has achieved successes so remarkable as\r\nto have secured a permanent place in the traditions of the bar, and the\r\nhistory of judicial proceedings in Northern Ohio. The older lawyers have\r\nvivid recollections of a multitude of cases when he was in full practice,\r\nand in his prime, in which his ready insight into character--his power to\r\nsift testimony and bring into clear relief the lines of truth involved in\r\ncomplicated causes--his ability to state the legal principles so that the\r\njury could intelligently apply them to the facts--his humor--his pure\r\nwit--his pathos, at times bringing unfeigned tears to the eyes of both\r\njudge and jurors--his burning scorn of fraud--and his appeal on behalf of\r\nwhat he believed to be right, so impetuous with enthusiasm, so condensed\r\nand incisive in expression, and so felicitous in illustration, as to be\r\nwell nigh irresistible.\r\n\r\nYet, highly as Judge Andrews has adorned his profession, it is simply\r\njustice to say in conclusion, that his unblemished character in every\r\nrelation has adorned his manhood. He has been far more than a mere lawyer.\r\nWith a keen relish for historical and philosophical inquiry--a wide\r\nacquaintance with literature, and an earnest sympathy with the advanced\r\nlines of thought in the present age, his life has also been practically\r\nsubordinated to the faultless morality of Christianity. A community is\r\ntruly enriched, when it possesses, and can present to its younger members,\r\nsuch shining instances of success in honorable endeavor, and sterling\r\nexcellence in character and example.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn W. Allen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Allen, though not among the first attorneys who settled in Cleveland,\r\nwas upon the ground early among the second generation. Samuel Huntington\r\nwas the first lawyer of the place, becoming a resident here in the year\r\n1801. Alfred Kelley was his successor, commencing his legal career as soon\r\nas the county courts were organized in 1810. In 1816, Leonard Case was\r\nadded to the profession and in 1818 the late Governor Wood and Samuel\r\nCowles, and about 1822, John W. Willey About the year 1826, soon after the\r\nconstruction of the Ohio canal was commenced, a troop of young lawyers\r\ntook possession of the field, some of whom still survive, Sherlock J.\r\nAndrews, Samuel Starkweather and John W. Allen. They were all from Yankee\r\nland, in pursuit of fame and fortune. Mr. Allen originated in Litchfield\r\ncounty, Connecticut, a place prolific in prominent characters. His father,\r\nJohn Allen, was a member of Congress from that State.\r\n\r\nFrom 1831 to 1835, inclusive, he was elected annually to be president of\r\nthe village corporation of Cleveland, and mayor of the city corporation\r\nof Cleveland 1841. In 1835-7, Mr. Allen represented the district of\r\nwhich Cuyahoga county was a part, in the Ohio Senate, and in 1836 was\r\nelected to the Congress of the United States, commencing with the famous\r\nextra session of September, 1837, as an old line Clay Whig, and was\r\nre-elected in 1838.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Cleveland assumed the position of a city in 1836, the subject\r\nof railways became one of the prominent public questions. A portion of the\r\ncitizens were of the opinion that they had yielded enough to the spirit of\r\nmodern innovation when the Ohio canal was suffered to enter Cleveland.\r\nThis had banished the Dutch wagons entirely, and railroads might complete\r\nour ruin entirely, by banishing canal boats. Mr. Allen, and the new comers\r\ngenerally, took the opposite side. While he was rising to a leading public\r\nposition he labored zealously in the cause of railways in harmony with his\r\npolitical opponents John W. Willey, Richard Hilliard, James S. Clark and\r\nothers, most of whom are dead. But for his zeal and perseverence the\r\nCleveland & Columbus Railroad Company would not have been organized\r\nprobably for years after it was and then it was done almost in spite of\r\nmany of the large property holders of that day, who looked upon the\r\nenterprise as chimerical.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen's free and generous manner not only rendered him popular among\r\nhis political friends, but prevented bitterness and personality on the\r\npart of his opponents. During those years of prosperity he led a\r\nthoroughly active life, not only as an attorney with a large practice,\r\nbut as an indefatigable public servant. In fact, through life he has\r\ngiven to the public the first and best of his efforts. He never became a\r\nfinished advocate and speaker, but his enterprise and integrity secured\r\nhim a large business, most of which was litigated in the counties of the\r\nWestern Reserve.\r\n\r\nNot long after Mr. Allen commenced practice in Ohio he married Miss Ann\r\nMaria Perkins of Warren, Trumbull county, an auspicious connection which\r\nwas soon terminated by her death. His second wife was Miss Harriet Mather,\r\nof New London county, Connecticut, who is now living, and was the mother\r\nof two sons and two daughters, one son and one daughter now surviving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: J. W. Allen]\r\n\r\nThe financial storm of 1837-8 did so much damage to Mr. Allen's fortune,\r\nas well as some unsuccessful efforts in the construction of local rail\r\nroads ahead of time, that its effects are not yet gone. Being young and\r\nenergetic, with a large property, with few debts of his own, it would have\r\naffected him but little, had he not been too generous towards his friends\r\nin the way of endorsements.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1849-50, he was appointed under a resolution of the\r\nLegislature the Agent of the State to examine into the claims of the State\r\non the General Government growing out of the grants of land in aid of the\r\ncanals and which had been twice settled and receipted for in full, which\r\noccupied him five years at Washington. In this he was eminently successful\r\nand did the State great service, and had the State performed its part of\r\nthe bargain as well as Mr. Allen did his, the result would have been a\r\nrich compensation for his labors. His was the only case of repudiation\r\never perpetrated by Ohio and he may well charge the State with punic faith\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\nWhen the State Bank of Ohio, consisting of branches scattered throughout\r\nthe State under the general management of a board of control, was\r\nauthorized by an act of the Legislature about the year 1846, and which was\r\nthe soundest system ever devised by any State Government, Mr. Allen was\r\none of the five Commissioners charged with the duty of putting the\r\nmachinery in operation.\r\n\r\nVery few of the present generation realize the obligation of this city to\r\nhim, and his public spirited coadjutors of thirty years since, for the\r\nsolid prosperity it now enjoys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHiram V. Willson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first judge of the United States District Court for the Northern\r\nDistrict of Ohio, will long be remembered by the bar and public of that\r\nDistrict, for the ability, dignity, and purity with which, for over eleven\r\nyears, he administered justice. When at last he lay down to his final\r\nrest, there was no voice raised in censure of any one of his acts, and\r\ntributes of heartfelt praise of his life, and sorrow for his loss, were\r\nlaid on his grave by men of all parties and shades of opinion. As lawyer,\r\njudge, citizen, and man, Judge Willson won the respect and confidence of\r\nall with whom he was brought into social or official contact.\r\n\r\nHiram V. Willson was born in April, 1808, in Madison county, New York.\r\nGraduating at Hamilton College in 1832, he commenced the study of law in\r\nthe office of the Hon. Jared Willson, of Canandaigua, New York.\r\nSubsequently he visited Virginia, read law in the office of Francis S.\r\nKey, of Washington, and for a time aided his slender pecuniary means by\r\nteaching in a classical school in the Shenandoah Valley. During his early\r\nlegal studies he laid the foundations of that legal knowledge for which he\r\nwas afterwards distinguished, and acquired that familiarity with the\r\ntext-books and reports which made him a safe, prompt, and prudent\r\ncounsellor. At school, college, and in the Shenandoah Valley, he\r\nmaintained a close intimacy with the Hon. Henry B. Payne, then a young man\r\nof about his own age. In 1833, he removed to Painesville, but soon changed\r\nhis residence to Cleveland, where he and his intimate friend, H. B. Payne,\r\nformed a law partnership.\r\n\r\nLong after, when at a banquet tendered by the bar of Cleveland in honor of\r\nthe organization of the United States Court for the Northern District of\r\nOhio, Judge Willson referred to the auspices under which the young firm\r\ncommenced business. The following toast had been offered:\r\n\r\n  The First Judge of the Northern District of Ohio: In the history and\r\n  eminent success of a twenty years' practice at the Bar, we have the\r\n  fullest assurance that whatever industry, talent, and integrity can\r\n  achieve for the character of this long sought for court, will be\r\n  accomplished by the gentleman who has been appointed to preside over its\r\n  deliberations.\r\n\r\nIn responding to the toast, Judge Willson spoke highly of the character\r\nof the profession, and then made a warm appeal to the young lawyers. He\r\nsaid that all there had been young lawyers and knew the struggles and\r\ndifficulties that hang around the lawyer's early path, and which cloud to\r\nhim his future, and nothing is so welcome, so genial to a young lawyer's\r\nheart as to be taken in hand by an older legal brother. He said he could\r\ntalk with feeling on the subject, for the memory was yet green of the days\r\nwhen two penniless young men came to Ohio to take life's start, and when\r\nas discouragements, and almost despair, seemed to lie in wait for them,\r\nthere was an older lawyer who held out a friendly hand to aid them, and\r\nwho bid them take courage and persevere. Who that friend was he signified\r\nby offering, with much feeling, a toast to the memory of Judge Willey.\r\n\r\nBut the young firm did not long need friendly counsel to cheer them in the\r\nmidst of discouragements. Although they were but young men, and Willey,\r\nCongar, and Andrews were eminent lawyers in full practice, they soon took\r\nplace in the front rank of the profession. Business flowed in upon them,\r\nand from 1837 to 1840, the number of suits brought by them in the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas averaged two hundred and fifty per year; whilst during the\r\nsame time they appeared for the defence in twice that number of cases\r\nannually. Briefs in all those cases were, to a great extent, prepared by\r\nJudge Willson. Upon Mr. Payne's retirement, a partnership was formed with\r\nHon. Edward Wade and Reuben Hitchcock, and after a while the firm was\r\nchanged to Willson, Wade & Wade. Under these partnerships the extensive\r\nbusiness and high reputation of the old firm were preserved and increased.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, Judge Willson ran for Congress on the Democratic ticket, against\r\nWilliam Case on the Whig and Edward Wade on the Free Soil tickets. Mr.\r\nWade was elected, but Judge Willson received a very handsome vote.\r\n\r\nIn the Winter of 1854, a bill was introduced to divide the State of Ohio,\r\nfor United States judicial purposes, into two districts. The members of\r\nthe Cleveland Bar pressed the matter vigorously, and after a sharp\r\nstruggle in Congress, the bill creating the United States Court for the\r\nNorthern District of Ohio was passed. During the pendency of the measure,\r\nand when the prospects were unfavorable for its passage, Judge Willson was\r\nchosen by the Cleveland Bar to proceed to Washington and labor in the\r\ninterest of the bill. This was done, and the final triumph of the bill was\r\ndoubtless owing in great measure to his unwearied industry in its behalf.\r\nIn March, 1855, President Pierce appointed Mr. Willson judge of the\r\nDistrict Court just authorized.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the court and the appointment of Judge Willson as its\r\npresiding officer, gave general satisfaction. A banquet was held by the\r\nlawyers to celebrate the event, and although Judge Willson was a strong\r\npolitical partizan, the leading lawyers of all parties vied with each\r\nother in testifying their entire confidence in the ability and\r\nimpartiality of the new judge. Nor was their confidence misplaced. In\r\nbecoming a judge he ceased to be a politician, and no purely political, or\r\npersonal, motives swayed his decisions. He was admitted by all to have\r\nbeen an upright judge.\r\n\r\nThe new court found plenty to do. In addition to the ordinary criminal\r\nand civil business, the location of the court on the lake border brought\r\nto it a large amount of admiralty cases. In such cases, the extensive\r\nknowledge and critical acumen of Judge Willson were favorably displayed.\r\nMany of his decisions were models of deep research and lucid statement.\r\nOne of his earliest decisions of this character was in relation to\r\nmaritime liens. The steamboat America had been abandoned and sunk, and\r\nonly a part of her tackle and rigging saved. These were attached for debt\r\nfor materials, and the question arose on the legality of the claim\r\nagainst articles no longer a part of the vessel. Judge Willson held that\r\nthe maritime lien of men for wages, and material men for supplies, is a\r\nproprietary interest in the vessel itself, and can not be diverted by the\r\nacts of the owner or by any casualty, until the claim is paid, and that\r\nsuch lien inheres to the ship and all her parts wherever found and\r\nwhoever may be the owner. In the case of L. Wick _vs._ the schooner\r\nSamuel Strong, in 1855, Judge Willson reviewed the history and intent of\r\nthe common carrier act of Ohio, in an opinion of much interest. A case,\r\nnot in admiralty, but in the criminal business of the court, gave the\r\njudge another opportunity for falling back on his inexhaustible stores of\r\nlegal and historical knowledge. The question was on the point whether the\r\naction of a grand jury was legal in returning a bill of indictment found\r\nonly by fourteen members, the fifteenth member being absent and taking no\r\npart in the proceedings. Judge Willson reviewed the matter at length,\r\nciting precedents of the English and American courts for several\r\ncenturies to show that the action was legal.\r\n\r\nA very noticeable case was what is known in the legal history of\r\nCleveland as \"The Bridge Case,\" in which Charles Avery sued the city of\r\nCleveland, to prevent the construction of a bridge across the Cuyahoga,\r\nat the foot of Lighthouse street. The questions arising were: the\r\nlegislative authority of the city to bridge the river, and whether the\r\nbridge would be a nuisance, damaging the complainant's private property.\r\nThe decision of Judge Willson, granting a preliminary injunction until\r\nfurther evidence could be taken, was a thorough review of the law\r\nrelating to water highways and their obstructions. In the opinion on the\r\nParker water-wheel case, he exhibited a clear knowledge of mechanics, and\r\ngave an exhaustive exposition of the law of patents. In the case of Hoag\r\n_vs_ the propeller Cataract, the law of collision was set forth and\r\nnumerous precedents cited. In 1860, important decisions were given in\r\nrespect to the extent of United States jurisdiction on the Western lakes\r\nand rivers. It was decided, and the decisions supported by voluminous\r\nprecedents, that the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction possessed by the\r\nDistrict Courts of the United States, on the Western lakes and rivers,\r\nunder the Constitution and Act of 1789, was independent of the Act of\r\n1845, and unaffected thereby; and also that the District Courts of the\r\nUnited States, having under the Constitution and Acts of Congress,\r\nexclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and\r\nmaritime jurisdiction, the Courts of Common Law are precluded from\r\nproceeding _in rem_ to enforce such maritime claims.\r\n\r\nThese are but a very few of the many important cases coming before Judge\r\nWillson's court and decided by him in a manner that made his decisions\r\nimportant precedents.\r\n\r\nThe judicial administration of Judge Willson was noticeable also for its\r\nconnection with events of national importance. And here it should be again\r\nrepeated, that in all his conduct on the bench he divested himself of\r\npersonal or party predilections and prejudices. To him it was of no\r\nconsequence who were parties to the case, or what the political effect of\r\na decision would be; he inquired only what were the facts in the matter\r\nand what the law bearing upon them. The keynote of his character in this\r\nrespect may be known from an extract taken from his charge to the grand\r\njury in the Winter term of 1856, in which it was expected a case would\r\ncome before that body of alleged impropriety or crime by a Government\r\nofficer, growing out of party zeal during a very heated political canvass.\r\nThe passions of men were intensely excited at the time of the delivery of\r\nthe charge, and that address had the effect of suddenly cooling down the\r\npopular mind, in the city and vicinity at least, and of bringing about a\r\nbetter state of feeling. After referring impressively to the language of\r\nthe oath taken by the grand jury, to present none through malice, and\r\nexcept none through favouritism, Judge Willson said:\r\n\r\n  It was but yesterday our ears were deafened by the turmoil and clamour\r\n  of political strife, shaking the great national fabric to its centre,\r\n  and threatening the stability of the Government itself. In that fearful\r\n  conflict for the control of the Executive and Legislative Departments of\r\n  the Federal Government, all the evil passions of men seem to have been\r\n  aroused. Vituperation and scandal, malice, hatred and ill-will had\r\n  blotted out from the land all brotherly love, and swept away those\r\n  characteristics which should distinguish us as a nation of Christians.\r\n\r\n  How important, then, it is for us, coming up here to perform the duties\r\n  incident to the courts, to come with minds free from prejudice, free\r\n  from passions, and free from the influence of the angry elements around\r\n  us. To come with a fixed purpose of administering justice with truth,\r\n  according to the laws of the land. A dangerous political contagion has\r\n  become rampant in our country, invading the holy sanctuaries of the\r\n  \"Prince of Peace\" and polluting the very fountains of Eternal Truth.\r\n\r\n  God forbid the time may ever come when the temples of justice in our\r\n  land shall be desecrated by this unhallowed and contaminating influence,\r\n  or by wanton disregard of the Constitution, or by a perfidious\r\n  delinquency on the part of the ministers of the law. Here let passion\r\n  and prejudice find no abiding place. Here let equal and exact justice be\r\n  meted out to all men--to rich and to the poor--to the high and the low,\r\n  and above all things, with you, gentlemen, here preserve with scrupulons\r\n  fidelity the sanctity of your oaths, and discharge your whole duty\r\n  without fear and without favour. Put justice to the line and truth to\r\n  the plummet, and act up fully to the obligations of that oath, and you\r\n  will ever enjoy those rich consolations which always flow from a\r\n  conscientious discharge of a sworn duty.\r\n\r\n  To men of your intelligence and probity, these admonitions are, perhaps,\r\n  unnecessary. Knowing, however, the reluctance and pain with which the\r\n  misconduct of men in office is inquired into, by those who cherish the\r\n  same political sentiments, I am confident, gentlemen, that in times like\r\n  these, you can not exercise too great caution in excluding from your\r\n  minds all considerations, as to whether the party charged before you is\r\n  the appointee of this or of that administration, or whether he belongs\r\n  to this or that political organization or party.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, came before the court the historic case of the Oberlin-Wellington\r\nRescue. The facts of the case were, briefly, that on the first of March,\r\n1857, a negro slave named John, the property of John G. Bacon, of\r\nKentucky, escaped across the river into Ohio. In October, 1858, the negro\r\nwas traced out and arrested within the Northern District of Ohio, by one\r\nAnderson Jennings, holding a power of attorney from Bacon. In company with\r\nan assistant named Love, Jennings took the negro to Wellington, Lorain\r\ncounty, with the purpose of taking the cars for Cincinnati, and thence\r\nreturning the negro to Kentucky and remitting him to slavery. A number of\r\nresidents of Oberlin concerted a plan of rescue marched to Wellington,\r\nentered the hotel where John was kept, took him from his captors, placed\r\nhim in a buggy, and carried him off. Indictments were found against the\r\nleading rescuers, who comprised among others some of the leading men of\r\nthe college and village of Oberlin, and they were brought to trial, fined,\r\nand imprisoned. The trial created great excitement, and, whilst it was\r\npending, a monster demonstration against the Fugitive Slave Law was held\r\non the Public Square, midway between the building where the court held its\r\nsessions and the jail in which the accused were confined. At one time\r\nfears were entertained of violence, threats being freely uttered by some\r\nof the more headstrong that the law should be defied and the prisoners\r\nreleased by force. Cooler counsels prevailed, and the law, odious as it\r\nwas felt to be, was allowed to take its course. In this exciting time the\r\ncharges and judgments of Judge Willson were calm and dispassionate, wholly\r\ndivested of partisanship, and merely pointing out the provisions of the\r\nlaw and the necessity of obedience to it, however irksome such obedience\r\nmight be, until it was repealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. V. Willson]\r\n\r\nIn the November term of 1859, when the public mind was still agitated by\r\nthe John Brown raid and by the tragic affairs succeeding it, and when the\r\nexcitement of the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue had not wholly subsided, the\r\nattention of Judge Willson was called to these matters by the District\r\nAttorney, and in his charge to the grand jury he took occasion to define\r\nthe law of treason, with especial bearing on those events. It was a clear,\r\nlogical exposition of the law, pointing out the line of distinction\r\nbetween a meeting for the expression of opinions hostile to the Government\r\nand a gathering for the purpose of violently opposing or overturning the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, when the rebellion had broken out, and it was supposed\r\nsympathizers with it were in Ohio plotting aid to the rebels, Judge\r\nWillson delivered a charge to the grand jury, again defining the law in\r\nregard to conspiracy and treason, and in the course of his address\r\ntook occasion to unreservedly condemn the motives and actions of the\r\nrebels. He said:\r\n\r\n  The loyal people of this great nation have enjoyed the blessings of our\r\n  excellent Constitution too long and too well, to be insensible of its\r\n  value or to permit its destruction. They have not yet been schooled to\r\n  the heresy, that this noble Government is a mere myth, or that it is\r\n  destitute of the inherent power of perpetuating its own existence. On\r\n  the contrary, next to their religion, they love and cherish it above all\r\n  things on earth, not only because it is the rich and sacred legacy of a\r\n  revered and patriotic ancestry, but because it is a Government of law,\r\n  possessing the authority to maintain social and civil order, giving to\r\n  its citizens security of property, of person and of life.\r\n\r\n  It is not surprising, therefore, that this bold and mad rebellion in the\r\n  Southern States, has excited, in all patriotic hearts, a spontaneous and\r\n  indignant feeling against treason and traitors, wherever they may be\r\n  found in our land. It is a rebellion without cause and without\r\n  justification. It had its conception in the wicked hearts of ambitious\r\n  men. Possibly, some of the chief conspirators may be actuated by the\r\n  spirit of the sacrilegious incendiary who fired the Ephesian temple to\r\n  immortalize his name by the infamy of the act.\r\n\r\n  Let the motives of the conspirators be what they may, this open,\r\n  organized and armed resistance to the Government of the United States is\r\n  _treason_, and those engaged in it justly merit the penalty denounced\r\n  against traitors.\r\n\r\n  Nor should we be misled by false notions of the reserved right of the\r\n  States to secede from the Union. This assumed right, claimed by the\r\n  States in rebellion, is false in theory; it is of the highest criminalty\r\n  in practice, and without the semblance of authority in the Constitution.\r\n  The right of secession, (said the lamented Webster,) \"as a practical\r\n  right, existing under the Constitution, is simply an absurdity; for it\r\n  supposes resistance to Government under the authority of the Government\r\n  itself--it supposes dismemberment without violating the principles of\r\n  Union--it supposes opposition to law without crime--it sanctions the\r\n  violation of oaths without responsibility, and the total overthrow of\r\n  the Government without revolution.\"\r\n\r\n  The history of this wicked rebellion already shows that many of those\r\n  who have shared the largest in the offices and emoluments, as well as in\r\n  the blessings of the National Government, have fallen the lowest in\r\n  infamy in attempting its overthrow.\r\n\r\n  If this Union is to be perpetuated, and the Government itself is to\r\n  exist as a power among the nations, its laws must be enforced at all\r\n  hazards and at any cost. And especially should courts and juries do\r\n  their whole duty, without respect to persons, when crimes are committed,\r\n  tending to the subversion of the Government and the destruction of our\r\n  cherished institutions.\r\n\r\nAt the January term, 1864, he delivered another admirable charge, in which\r\nhe discussed the questions arising under the then recent act of Congress\r\nauthorizing a draft under the direction of the President without the\r\nintervention of the State authorities, and by a very logical and\r\nconclusive argument established the constitutional validity of the act in\r\nquestion. The crime of resisting the draft, obstructing its execution by\r\nthe officers appointed for that purpose, and enticing soldiers to desert,\r\nwere defined with great clearness, resisting the enrolling officer being\r\nheld to be within the offences embraced in the act. These were but a few\r\nof the topics treated by the Judge. The entire charge was able, well-timed\r\nand patriotic, and was admirably calculated to conciliate and unite public\r\nopinion in support of the law and the measures of the Government to\r\nenforce it.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the health of Judge Willson began to give way and symptoms of\r\nconsumption appeared. He was strongly urged by his friends to leave his\r\nbusiness for a time and seek the restoration of his health in a milder\r\nclimate. As Winter approached he yielded to their persuasions and visited\r\nNew Orleans and the West Indies. Unhappily the weather was unusually\r\nsevere for those latitudes, and he derived no benefit from his trip. He\r\nwas glad to reach the quiet and comfort of home once more. His sense of\r\nduty was so strong that, though unfit to leave his home, he came down to\r\nthe city, opened court, so as to set the machinery in order, but found\r\nhimself unable to preside and was compelled to return home, where he\r\nawaited in patience the coming of the destroyer.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 11th, 1866, he died. A few hours before his\r\ndeath he suffered much, his breathing being labored and painful. As his\r\nend approached, however, he became easier, and his life went out without a\r\nstruggle. Some months earlier, the Judge, who had for years been an\r\nattendant of the services in the First Presbyterian church, and an active\r\nsupporter of that congregation, made a profession of religion and received\r\nthe rite of baptism. He was perfectly conscious to the close of his life,\r\nand although hopeful of recovery, as is usual with the victims of\r\nconsumption, had been fully aware of his precarious situation, and had\r\nthoughtfully contemplated his approaching end. He left a widow and a\r\ndaughter, Mrs. Chamberlin, well provided for.\r\n\r\nOn the announcement of his death the members of the Cleveland Bar\r\nimmediately assembled, and young or old, of all shades of opinion in the\r\nprofession, vied with each other in bearing testimony to the uprightness,\r\nability, and moral worth of the deceased. His death occasioned unaffected\r\nsorrow among those who had known him, and among the large number of his\r\nlegal brethren who had greater or less opportunities of official\r\nintercourse with him he did not leave a single enemy. The Bar meeting\r\nunanimously adopted the following resolutions of respect:\r\n\r\n  We, the members of the Bar of the Northern District of Ohio having\r\n  learned that our brother, the Hon. Hiram V. Willson, departed this life\r\n  yesterday evening, (Nov. 11,) at his residence, and desiring to pay a\r\n  tribute of affection and respect to one who was our beloved associate at\r\n  this Bar for twenty-one years, and anxious also to acknowledge our\r\n  obligation to him, by whose influence and labors the Courts of the\r\n  United States were established in our midst, and who has so ably and\r\n  uprightly presided over those Courts for a period of more than eleven\r\n  years, do hereby\r\n\r\n  _Resolve,_ 1st. That in the death of Judge Willson the Bench has lost a\r\n  learned, upright and fearless Judge, ever doing right and equity among\r\n  the suitors of his Court, fearing only the errors and mistakes to which\r\n  a fallible human judgment is ever liable. Urbanity and courtesy to the\r\n  older members of the Bar, protecting and loving kindness to its younger\r\n  members, and deep and abiding interest in the reputation of all, were\r\n  among his distinguishing characteristics.\r\n\r\n  2d. That in him we have lost a near and dear friend, disliked,\r\n  disrelished by none, but esteemed and loved by all.\r\n\r\n  3d. That we wear the usual mourning and attend his funeral in a body, on\r\n  Wednesday next.\r\n\r\n  4th. That the Chairman of this Committee present this report to our\r\n  Court of Common Pleas, and request the same to be entered on the record\r\n  of said Court.\r\n\r\n  5th. That the United States District Attorney for Northern Ohio be\r\n  requested to present this report to the Circuit and District Courts of\r\n  said District at their next term and request that the same be entered\r\n  and recorded in said Courts.\r\n\r\n  6th. That the officers of this meeting be directed to send a copy of its\r\n  proceedings to the family of the deceased.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the next term of the United States District Court under\r\nJudge Sherman, the successor to Judge Willson, these resolutions were\r\nread, and warm eulogies on the deceased were made by U. S. District\r\nAttorney, F. J. Dickman, U. S. Commissioner Bushnell White, George W.\r\nWilley Esq., Hon. K. P. Spalding and Judge Sherman.\r\n\r\nThe funeral services over the remains of Judge Willson were held in the\r\nFirst Presbyterian church, conducted by Rev. Dr. Atterburry, assisted by\r\nRev. Dr. Aiken. The Supreme Court of Ohio, United States Courts of\r\nPennsylvania and Michigan, the Cleveland Bench and Bar, and the City\r\nGovernment were fully represented at the ceremonies, which were also\r\nparticipated in by a very large concourse of citizens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel Starkweather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a member of the legal profession, both on the Bench and at the Bar, as\r\nthe chief magistrate of the city, and as an United States revenue officer,\r\nand as a citizen of Cleveland, Samuel Starkweather has held honorable\r\nprominence for forty years.\r\n\r\nHe was born in the village of Pawtucket, Massachusetts, on the border of\r\nRhode Island, a village celebrated as the seat of the first cotton\r\nmanufactures in the United States. He was the son of the Honorable Oliver\r\nStarkweather, an extensive and successful manufacturer, and grandson of\r\nthe Honorable Ephraim Starkweather, who was prominent among the patriots\r\nof the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch worked on a farm until nearly seventeen years\r\nof age, when he began to fit himself for college, after which he entered\r\nBrown University, Rhode Island, where he graduated with the second honors\r\nof his class, in the year 1822, and was soon afterward elected a tutor in\r\nthat institution, which position he held until the year 1824, when he\r\nresigned, to commence the study of the law, which he pursued in the office\r\nof Judge Swift, in Windham, Connecticut, and afterwards in attendance upon\r\nthe lectures of Chancellor Kent, of New York. He was admitted to the Bar\r\nof Ohio at Columbus, in the Winter of 1826-7, and soon after settled in\r\nCleveland, then a village of a few hundred inhabitants, and was recognized\r\nas a lawyer of learning and ability in this and the adjoining counties.\r\n\r\nMr. Starkweather was prominent among the leaders of the Democratic party\r\nof this State, when its principles were well defined, and was a strong\r\nadherent to the administrations of Presidents Jackson and Van Buren, but\r\nhis being always in the political minority in the part of the State in\r\nwhich he lived, prevented those high political preferments which otherwise\r\nwould have been conferred upon him. In this connection it is proper to\r\nsay, that for Mr. Starkweather to have attained the highest eminence in\r\nthe legal profession, it was only necessary that he should have made it\r\nhis specialty.\r\n\r\nUnder the administrations of Presidents Jackson and Van Buren, Mr.\r\nStarkweather held the office of Collector of Customs of this District, and\r\nSuperintendent of Light-Houses, and under his supervision most of the\r\nsites were purchased, and the light-houses erected on the Southern shore\r\nof Lake Erie. He continued to hold these offices in connection with his\r\npractice of the law, until 1840.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Mr. Starkweather was elected Mayor of the city of Cleveland,\r\nhaving previously taken a leading part in the City Councils. He was\r\nre-elected in 1845, and was again elected Mayor in 1857, for two years,\r\nand in these positions was active in promoting those improvements in the\r\ncity which have tended to its prosperity and beauty. To Mr. Starkweather\r\nthe public schools of the city are much indebted for the interest which he\r\nhas always taken in their behalf; and to his advocacy and efforts, with\r\nthose of Mr. Charles Bradburn, the High School of the city owes its first\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nIn the early struggles for advancing the schemes of railroads, the\r\naccomplishment of which has made Cleveland the great city of commerce and\r\nmanufactures, no one was more active than Mr. Starkweather. When the\r\nproject of building the Cleveland & Columbus road was at a stand-still,\r\nand was on the point of being, for the time, abandoned, as a final effort\r\na meeting of the business men of Cleveland was called. The speech of Mr.\r\nStarkweather on that occasion, parts of which are quoted to this day, had\r\nthe effect to breathe into that enterprise the breath of life, and from\r\nthat meeting it went immediately onward to its final completion. So well\r\nwere the services of Mr. Starkweather in behalf of that road appreciated\r\nat the time, that one of the Directors proposed that he should have a\r\npass upon it for life.\r\n\r\nMr. Starkweather, in 1852, was the first Judge elected to the Court of\r\nCommon Pleas for Cuyahoga county, under the new constitution of the State,\r\nin which position he served for five years with ability and satisfaction\r\nto the members of the Bar and the public generally. For a considerable\r\nportion of his term, the entire docket of both civil and criminal business\r\ndevolved on Mm, when an additional Judge was allowed the county. He\r\npresided at some very important State trials, in which, as in the\r\ndisposition of a very large amount of civil business, he exhibited\r\nabundant legal learning and judicial discrimination.\r\n\r\nSince he retired from the Bench he has been known as a citizen of wealth,\r\nof retired habits, but of influence in public affairs, and retaining to\r\nthe full the conversational gifts which have made him the life and charm\r\nof social and professional circles. Indeed it may be said that either at\r\nthe Bar, in well remembered efforts of marked brilliancy as an advocate,\r\nor on the Bench, occasionally illuminating the soberness of judicial\r\nproceedings, or in assemblies on prominent public occasions occurring all\r\nthrough his life, eloquence, wit and humor seemed ready to his use. A fine\r\n_belle lettres_ scholar, classical, historical and biographical adornments\r\nand incidents seemed always naturally to flow in to enrich his discourse,\r\nwhether in private or public. He has often been spoken of as of the Corwin\r\ncast, perhaps a slight personal resemblance aiding the suggestion. He\r\ncertainly has the like gifts of the charming conversationalist and the\r\npopular orator, in which last capacity, for many years, he was the prompt\r\nchoice of the public on leading occasions, such as at the grand reception\r\ngiven to Van Buren after his defeat in 1840; the magnificent reception\r\ntendered by the city to Kossuth; at the completion of the Cleveland &\r\nColumbus Railway on the 22nd of February, 1852; at the dedication of\r\nWoodland Cemetery, and at many other times when the public were most\r\nanxious to put a gifted man forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truly Yours, Moses Kelly]\r\n\r\n\r\nMoses Kelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was born January 21st, 1809, in the township of\r\nGroveland, now county of Livingston, then county of Ontario, State of New\r\nYork. He was the oldest son of Daniel Kelly, who emigrated from the State\r\nof Pennsylvania to Western New York in the year 1797. He is of\r\nScotch-Irish descent in the paternal line, and of German descent on the\r\nside of his mother. His great grandfather, on his father's side, emigrated\r\nfrom the North of Ireland to America, early in the eighteenth century, and\r\nsettled in the State of Pennsylvania, within a few miles of the city of\r\nPhiladelphia; his grandfather, born there, was a Revolutionary soldier.\r\nMr. Kelly lived with his father, on a farm in Groveland, until he was\r\neighteen years old, having the usual advantages, and following the\r\nordinary pursuits of a farmer's son.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen he entered the High School on Temple Hill, in the\r\nvillage of Genesee, Livingston county, New York, and commenced preparing\r\nfor college, under the tuition of that eminent scholar and accomplished\r\neducator, the late Cornelius C. Felton, who subsequently became President\r\nof Harvard University. Mr. Kelly entered the Freshman class at Harvard in\r\n1829, and graduated with his class in the year 1833. He immediately\r\ncommenced the study of the law, with the late Orlando Hastings, Esq., of\r\nRochester, N. Y., and read three years in his office and under his\r\ndirection, when he was admitted to practice. He came to Cleveland in the\r\nyear 1836, and formed a law copartnership with his old friend, college\r\nclassmate and chum, the Hon. Thomas Bolton; the firm name was Bolton &\r\nKelly. This partnership continued until the year 1851, when S. O. Griswold\r\nEsq., who had been their law student, was taken into the firm; the firm\r\nname thereafter being Bolton, Kelly & Griswold. This connection continued\r\nuntil the close of the year 1856, when Mr. Bolton was elected Judge of the\r\nCourt of Common Pleas. Since Judge Bolton retired from the firm Messrs.\r\nKelly & Griswold have continued the practice of law under that firm name,\r\nand are still engaged in the practice.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly has made commercial law and equity jurisprudence his special\r\nstudies, and in these branches of the law his great skill and learning are\r\nacknowledged by all his brethren. Indeed, as an equity lawyer he stands at\r\nthe head of the profession.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the year 1836 until the present time, Mr. Kelly has\r\ndevoted himself closely to the practice of the law; the only interruption\r\nto this was a two years service as State senator in the legislature of\r\nOhio during the years 1844 and 1845. He was elected to the senate by the\r\nWhig party of the counties of Cuyahoga and Geauga, these two counties then\r\ncomposing one senatorial district. During the first session of the General\r\nAssembly, of which he was a member, the Democrats had a majority in the\r\nSenate while the Whigs had the control of the lower house. As is usual\r\nwhen a legislature is thus politically divided, no measures of general\r\ninterest were adopted. But there happened during that session to arise a\r\nquestion which showed Mr. Kelly's independence, and true character. The\r\nDemocracy had made complaint of the Whig extravagance and laid great claim\r\non their own part to retrenchment and economy in the State administration.\r\nThe Whigs to make political capital, proposed a bill reducing the salaries\r\nof all State officers; the salary of the Judges was put at $750 per year\r\nand the pay of all other State officials in the same ratio. The measure\r\nwas adopted by the party caucus, and was carried through the lower house.\r\n\r\nIt was hoped by many that the Senate, being Democratic, would defeat the\r\nbill, and thus the Whigs would have credit for great economy at the\r\nexpense of the Democrats. But when it came to that body, the Democracy,\r\nnot to be out done by their opponents, favored the bill.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly, singly and alone of all his party, opposed the measure, and\r\nspoke and voted against it. The bill was finally carried but was repealed\r\nin the course of a year or two afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent subject before the legislature at the second session\r\nwas the establishment of a suitable banking system for the State. The\r\nbusiness men of Cleveland were in favor of free banks, but the great body\r\nof the Whig party were strongly in favor of a State Bank and branches, and\r\nhaving a majority in both houses in the session of 1845 were determined to\r\nestablish that system. Mr. Kelly succeeded in engrafting upon the State\r\nBank scheme the Independent Bank system, with State stocks pledged to\r\nsecure the circulation, and also in adding additional checks and\r\nsafeguards to the State Bank. His efforts in this direction were duly\r\nappreciated by his constituents, and at a public meeting, called by the\r\nprincipal business men of the city, irrespective of party, his action on\r\nthe Bank bill was specially approved.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed also that the present National Bank system is modeled\r\nafter the plan of free banking advocated by Mr. Kelly at that time.\r\n\r\nDuring the same session a question arose in which Mr. Kelly took an\r\nactive part, in opposition to the great body of his party, the event of\r\nwhich vindicated his sagacity and practical statesmanship. The question\r\nwas upon a bill to grant to the Ohio Life and Trust Company authority to\r\nissue bills to circulate as currency, to the extent of half a million of\r\ndollars. At the time this bill was introduced no banking System had been\r\nadopted by the legislature; most of the charters of the old banks had\r\nexpired prior to that time, and the State was without an adequate bank\r\ncirculation of its own. The chief stockholders and managers of that\r\ncorporation were men of high character and great wealth. The company had\r\nbeen successfully managed, and its credit was then deservedly high. Also\r\nthe principal men of the company were leading Whigs, among these were\r\nJudges Jacob Burnett and John E. Wright of Cincinnati, Nathaniel Wright\r\nof Cincinnati and Alfred Kelley Esq., who was also at the same time a\r\nmember of the senate from the Franklin district, and this application on\r\nthe part of the company was backed by the presence and Personal influence\r\nof these gentlemen. The plea made by this company for this additional\r\nbanking privilege was exceedingly plausible, and the measure was approved\r\nin a caucus of the Whig members almost without inquiry. The bill was\r\nintroduced into the Senate by the Hon. Alfred Kelley, and its success was\r\nconsidered certain. Mr. Moses Kelly, alone of his party, expressed his\r\nopposition to the bill. Urged as the measure was by so many leading men,'\r\nand introduced by the acknowledged leader of the party, it seemed that\r\nsuch opposition must be fruitless. But on the third reading of the bill\r\nMr. Kelly attacked it in a speech of great vigor, and strength of\r\nargument. He opposed it as unjust towards any banking system that might\r\nbe established and as unwise in giving additional privileges to an\r\nalready powerful corporation. Bat he opposed it chiefly because it gave\r\nto the corporation power to issue bills as money simply on individual\r\nsecurity. He contended that whenever the State permitted any corporation\r\nor organization to issue bills to pass as money the faith of the State\r\nshould be pledged to their ultimate redemption. While paying a high\r\ncompliment to the ability and integrity of the managers of the Ohio Life\r\nand Trust Company, he declared there was no security but what in the\r\nfuture it might pass into the control of Wall street shavers and brokers,\r\nand from thence to ruin, and the people of the State left remediless with\r\na worthless circulation in their hands. His vigorous opposition, and the\r\nstrength of his argument awakened the attention of the party to the evils\r\nof the measure, and notwithstanding its powerful backing, the bill was\r\neffectually killed by Mr. Kelly's speech.\r\n\r\nMr. Alfred Kelley was greatly grieved at the failure of this measure. He\r\nhowever lived to see his error, and the ruinous failure of that company\r\nthrough the recklessness of the Wall street management into whose hands,\r\nas had been predicted, that company finally fell. Judge John C. Wright,\r\nnow in Columbus, advocated the aforesaid measure. He was then the senior\r\neditor of the Cincinnati Gazette, and the influence of his paper was given\r\nto the bill. Although old, he was in the full enjoyment of his powers of\r\nintellect, and at that time wielded a great influence in the political\r\naffairs of the State. It happened that he was present in the senate\r\nchamber when Mr. Kelly made his speech against the bill; although\r\nchagrined at the defeat of the measure in which he had such personal\r\ninterest, so struck was he with the originality and force of the argument\r\nof Mr. Kelly, and with his independence of character, and ability to rise\r\nabove mere party considerations in his legislative career, that he sought\r\nMr. Kelly's personal acquaintance, and during the remainder of his life\r\nthere existed a warm personal friendship between them.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of his term of service Mr. Kelly returned to the\r\npractice and ever since has devoted his energies to his profession. The\r\noffice of Bolton & Kelly has been the school of many prominent lawyers.\r\nAmong the members of the Cleveland Bar who studied under them are Messrs.\r\nF. T. Backus, George Willey, John E. Cary and his present partner, Mr.\r\nGriswold. Mr. Kelly was City Attorney in the year 1839, and a member of\r\nthe City Council in 1841. While he was in the Council he was active in\r\nsupport of the Lake Shore improvement, which stopped the rapid\r\nencroachment of the Lake upon the shore in front of Lake street.\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Mr. Kelly was appointed by the legislature one of the\r\nCommissioners of the city of Cleveland to subscribe on behalf of the city\r\nto the capital stock of the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad Company. He\r\naccepted the trust, and for a number of successive years thereafter, until\r\nthe stock of the city in that road was disposed of, was chosen a Director\r\nof the Cleveland & Pittsburgh Railroad Company, to represent the\r\ninterests of this city in the capital stock of that company.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1866, he was appointed by President Johnson District\r\nAttorney of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio, and held\r\nthe office until the next March, not having been confirmed by the Radical\r\nsenate for the reason that he had been a member of the Philadelphia\r\nConvention of the previous summer.\r\n\r\nOn the organization of the City Bank of Cleveland under the law of 1845,\r\nMr. Kelly became a stockholder therein and was a director, and its\r\nattorney, during its existence, and has continued in the same connection\r\nwith the National City Bank which succeeded the former. He also for a\r\nnumber of years has been a director and attorney of the Cuyahoga Steam\r\nFurnace Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly was one of the organizers of St. Paul's Episcopal church, and\r\nhas always remained a liberal supporter of the same.\r\n\r\nHe was married in the year 1839 to Jane, the daughter of Gen. Hezekiah\r\nHowe, of New Haven, Conn.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Mr. Kelly purchased a tract of about thirty acres, being a part\r\nof what was then known as the \"Giddings farm,\" fronting on Euclid avenue,\r\na short distance East of Willson avenue. Here he soon after erected a\r\ntasteful dwelling, where he has since resided, and where in the leisure\r\nsnatched from professional avocations he has gratified his taste for\r\nhorticultural and agricultural pursuits.\r\n\r\nIn person Mr. Kelly is tall and spare, and dignified in demeanor, and\r\nalthough he has reached three score, he is still active and in good\r\nhealth. His character for integrity is unblemished and in his long\r\nprofessional career has never been known to uphold or defend a\r\ndishonorable cause. His rule has been to decline advocating causes which,\r\nin his judgment, have neither merits nor justice. In social intercourse he\r\nis affable and genial, and in public, private and professional life, has\r\nalways commanded the respect, esteem and confidence of his fellow men.\r\nFirm in his convictions of duty, and resolute in doing it, yet so\r\nrespectful and courteous to opponents is he that he may be said to be a\r\nman without an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe great rise in real estate and his professional earnings have rendered\r\nMr. Kelly, if not what in these days would be called wealthy,\r\ncomparatively rich, and surrounded, as he is, by an affectionate family\r\nand kind friends and possessed of all the enjoyments which culture and a\r\nsuccessful life brings, we trust he may long continue amongst us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Bolton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said of history, that it should never venture to deal\r\nexcept with periods comparatively remote. And this was doubtless true\r\nwhen literature was venal, or in any way subservient to royal or to\r\nparty power.\r\n\r\nIt has been alike suggested of biography, that it cannot be securely\r\ntrusted in the portrayal of the living. And this is no doubt true where\r\npolitical or partisan objects are sought to be subserved. But with this\r\nexception the most faithful portraits may naturally be expected where\r\nthe subjects of them are before us, and familiarly known to us. And so\r\nthat the hand refrains from those warmer tints which personal friendship\r\nmight inspire, and simply aims at sketches which the general judgment\r\nmay recognize and approve, the task, however difficult, cannot be said\r\nto be unsafe.\r\n\r\nThomas Bolton was born in Scipio, Cayuga county, New York, November 29th,\r\n1809. His father was an extensive farmer in that section of western New\r\nYork, where rich fields, and flowing streams, and beautiful scenery, are\r\nhappily combined.\r\n\r\nAt seventeen he entered the High School on Temple Hill, in Geneseo, where\r\nhe fitted for college; and in the Fall of 1829, he entered Harvard\r\nUniversity, where he graduated in 1833, the first in his class in\r\nmathematics. In this connection, it is pleasant to advert to the fact\r\nthat his most intimate schoolmate, classmate and fellow graduate, was\r\nHon. Moses Kelly, who was afterwards his partner in the law for many\r\nyears at Cleveland, and that between the two from boyhood down to the\r\npresent day, there has been a steadfast and unbroken life-friendship\r\nalmost fraternal, both now in affluence, but still living side by side.\r\nSuch life-long friendships are unusual, but whenever they do exist, they\r\nimply the presence in both parties of true and trusty qualities which\r\npreserve their character as pure cement, exposed to any atmosphere, or\r\ntried in any furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, Thomas Bolton]\r\n\r\nAfter graduating, Mr. Bolton entered upon the study of law at\r\nCanandaigua, in the office of John G. Spencer, now deceased, but then a\r\nstrong and distinguished name in the profession. At the end of a year he\r\ncame west, to seek a permanent location to further pursue his studies and\r\nenter upon the practice, first stopping at Cleveland, on finding that any\r\nfurther west was hardly within the pale of civilization. Cleveland itself\r\nwas then, September, 1834, but a mere village, of about twenty-five\r\nhundred inhabitants. Superior street had not been graded, and at its\r\nwestern terminus was higher than the first story of the Atwater Block, and\r\nthe bank of the lake extended fifteen rods out beyond the present Union\r\nDepot. The village did not become a city till 1836, when at a public\r\nmeeting to determine upon the corporate limits, Mr. Bolton was appointed\r\non a committee to draft the charter, and urged that both sides of the\r\nriver should be embraced, but was overruled, and Ohio City was established\r\non the other side of the river as a sort of rival, but since consolidated\r\nwith Cleveland. His connection with city affairs was renewed as\r\nCouncilman in 1839, and as Alderman in 1841.\r\n\r\nBut to go back to his professional life. Having studied law in the office\r\nof James L. Conger, at Cleveland, for a year, he was admitted to the Bar\r\nin September, 1835, by the Supreme Court of Ohio, on the Circuit, Chief\r\nJustice Peter Hitchcock, that Nestor among judges, then presiding. He was\r\nin partnership with Mr. Conger for a year, when he bought him out and sent\r\nfor his old college friend, Mr. Kelly, with whom he formed a partnership,\r\nwhich continued until the Fall of 1856, a period of twenty years, when he\r\nwas elected to the Bench.\r\n\r\nAs bearing upon his political career, it may be narrated, that in the Fall\r\nof 1839, he was elected prosecuting attorney of the county, at which time\r\nthe Whig party was largely in the ascendancy, commanding from 1,500 to\r\n2,000 majority, though he was a Democrat and nominated by the Democrats\r\nfor the office. Two years later, at the expiration of his term, he was\r\nstrongly solicited by both parties to take the office another term, but\r\ndeclined in consequence of the inadequacy of the salary.\r\n\r\nAn incident occurred during his term as prosecuting attorney which had a\r\nmarked effect upon the politics of Cleveland and its vicinity. Up to 1841,\r\nslave-owners were in the habit of sending their agents to Cleveland and\r\ncausing their runaway slaves to be arrested and taken before a magistrate,\r\nwhen a warrant would be obtained to return the slave, and he would be\r\ncarried back into slavery. All this was done openly and publicly, creating\r\nlittle or no excitement, and Mr. Bolton, in the practice of his\r\nprofession, was more frequently employed for this purpose than any other\r\nattorney in the city. In the Spring of 1841, three negroes, who were\r\nclaimed as slaves, had run away from New Orleans and were in Buffalo. The\r\nagent of their master applied to a law firm in Cleveland for assistance.\r\nAt that time, slaves arrested in Buffalo were in the habit of claiming a\r\ntrial by jury, which was granted. To avoid a jury, with its sympathies, it\r\nwas thought advisable to get the negroes into Ohio, and, accordingly, one\r\nof the attorneys, the agent and a negro of Cleveland, repaired to Buffalo.\r\nOn their return the three negroes came with them, and it was said they had\r\nbeen kidnapped. On their arrival at Cleveland, the negroes were arrested\r\nunder the law of Congress as fugitives from service, and lodged in the\r\ncounty jail. This information coming to the ears of the few Abolitionists\r\nthen in the city, among others the late Hon. Edward Wade and Hon. John A.\r\nFoot, lawyers at the time in full practice, they applied to the jailor for\r\nadmission to consult with the negroes. But public opinion was so strongly\r\nprejudiced against the Abolitionists that neither the jailor nor the\r\nsheriff would permit any of them to communicate with the prisoners.\r\nAccidentally, a colored man inquired of Mr. Bolton if he would take up\r\ntheir defence. He readily assented, and being prosecuting attorney of the\r\ncounty, and it being well understood that he was not an Abolitionist, the\r\ndoors of the jail were readily opened to him, and he immediately made\r\npreparations for a vigorous defence of the prisoners. A writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ was immediately applied for to Judge Barber, one of the associate\r\njudges at the time; the negroes were brought before him, and their case\r\ncontinued for ninety days, to prepare for a defence.\r\n\r\nWhen it was known about town that Mr. Bolton had undertaken the defence of\r\nthe negroes, great indignation was excited, and many threatened to tear\r\ndown his office, and to use violence toward his person. This only aroused\r\nhim to greater energy and effort in behalf of the prisoners. In the\r\nmeantime indictments were procured in Buffalo against the alleged\r\nkidnappers, and the excitement in the city greatly increased, so that on\r\nthe day of the trial the court-house was packed with people. After an\r\ninvestigation, which lasted two days, the court discharged the defendants\r\nand they went acquit.\r\n\r\nFrom the iniquitous proceeding in the case, and the manner in which it\r\nwas prosecuted, and the excitement it produced, the community was led to\r\nreflect upon the iniquity of the system and the oppression of the law;\r\nand from that day till the slave-girl Lucy was sent back into Virginia\r\nslavery, in 1862, (to appease, it is said, the wrath of the rebels,) not\r\na negro was sent back into slavery from the city of Cleveland, or county\r\nof Cuyahoga.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton left the Democratic party in 1848, or, as he claims, it left\r\nhim when it adopted its national platform of that year. He then joined the\r\nFree Soil party, and was a delegate to the Buffalo Convention, and one of\r\nits secretaries. In February, 1856, he assisted in organizing the\r\nRepublican party at the Pittsburgh Convention, and in the Summer of the\r\nsame year was a delegate from this Congressional District in the\r\nPhiladelphia Convention, which nominated Fremont and Dayton.\r\n\r\nWhen he was admitted to the Bar, the Court of Common Pleas, under the old\r\nConstitution, consisted of four members, a president judge and three\r\nassociates, elected by the Legislature, and the Supreme Court of the State\r\nconsisted of four judges, also chosen by the Legislature. A session of the\r\nSupreme Court was held by two of its members once a year in each county,\r\nand three sessions a year were held by the Court of Common Pleas in this\r\nand the adjoining counties. In 1835, Hon. Matthew Birchard, of Warren, was\r\npresident judge. He was succeeded by Hon. Van R. Humphrey, of Hudson, and\r\nhe by Hon. John W. Willey, of Cleveland, who died during his term. Hon.\r\nReuben Hitchcock was appointed by the Governor to fill the vacancy, and\r\nHon. Benjamin Bissel, of Painesville, was elected by the Legislature during\r\nthe next session. Hon. Philemon Bliss, then of Elyria, and now Supreme\r\nJudge of Missouri, was afterward elected, and his term was cut short in\r\n1851, by the adoption of the new Constitution, under which the judges were\r\nelected by the people for the term of five years. Hon. Samuel Starkweather\r\nwas the first judge elected under the new system, and in 1856. Mr. Bolton\r\nwas chosen his successor. In 1861, he was unanimounanimouslynated and\r\nelected without opposition, and in 1866, at the expiration of his second\r\nterm, he retired from the Bench and the Bar.\r\n\r\nWe thus complete our outline sketch of the professional, judicial, and\r\npolitical career of one of our most prominent and respected citizens.\r\n\r\nHe came to the Bar of Cleveland before Cleveland was a city, and entered\r\nupon practice with that force and earnestness which were the ruling\r\nelements of his nature. He had able competitors, but he was a strong man\r\namongst them. His promptness in the courts was proverbial. He was always\r\nready, and if he granted indulgences he never asked for any. He was less\r\ngiven to books than his partner, Mr. Kelly, who was the student and\r\nchancery member of the firm, but in the ordinary departments of the common\r\nlaw and in criminal practice, he was always at home. He prepared his\r\ncauses with the most thorough premeditation of the line of his own\r\nevidence, and of all the opposing evidence that could possibly be\r\nanticipated. Hence he moved with rapidity and precision, and was never\r\ntaken by surprise. His arguments were not elaborate, or studied in point\r\nof finish, but they were strong, downright practical, and to the point. In\r\nthis sense he was a fine and effective speaker to courts and juries.\r\n\r\nThese same characteristics he exhibited upon the Bench. Hardy and vigorous\r\nin his perceptions and understanding--thoroughly versed and ready in the\r\nlaw of pleadings and evidence--bringing to bear on the civil code, the\r\nlogical training of the common law system--his ten years of service as a\r\njudge were honorable to himself and valuable to the public. In all the\r\nphases of his career and life he has been thoroughly upright.\r\n\r\nRetired upon an ample fortune, amassed by forecast and business\r\nenergy--fond of his home, and devoted with entire liberality to the\r\neducation of his children--independent of office and in all other\r\nways--strong and robust as ever in person and in mind--he is still a power\r\nin any direction wherever he chooses so to be. His broad, projecting\r\nbrow, his direct and forcible speech and bearing, symbolize his character.\r\nThey assure you of vital energy, strong, practical comprehension,\r\ndirectness and will. He may have more of the \"_fortiter in re_\" than of\r\nthe \"_suaviter in modo_\" but all who know him have faith in his truth,\r\nimplicit reliance upon the hearty fidelity of his friendships, and\r\nassurance, that he is always loyal to his convictions, both in public and\r\nin private life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames M. Hoyt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years since, the writer of this was in conversation with a poor\r\nman who had a hard struggle with misfortune and sickness in his attempt to\r\nrear a large family, and secure them a humble homestead. In the course of\r\nconversation the name of James M. Hoyt was mentioned, and the poor man was\r\ninquired of who that gentleman was. \"Lawyer Hoyt?\" he replied, \"why he's\r\nthe _honest lawyer_, God bless him!\" He who could acquire this title among\r\nthe poor must be no ordinary man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James M. Hoyt]\r\n\r\nJames M. Hoyt was born in Utica, New York, January 16, 1815. The\r\ncircumstances of his parents were such that he was enabled to acquire a\r\ngood education, and graduated at Hamilton College, Clinton, New York, in\r\n1834. On leaving College he commenced the study of law in Utica, but soon\r\nremoved to Cleveland, where, in February, 1836, he read law in the office\r\nof Andrews & Foot. He remained with them in that capacity for one year,\r\nwhen a partnership was formed under the name of Andrews, Foot & Hoyt,\r\nwhich lasted about twelve years, and was dissolved only by the appointment\r\nof Judge Andrews to the bench of the Superior Court of Cuyahoga county.\r\nThe firm of Foot & Hoyt continued four years longer, until in 1853, Mr.\r\nHoyt withdrew from the practice of law and turned his attention wholly to\r\nthe business of real estate, not as a broker, but as an operator on his\r\nown account, or in company with others, nearly all his operations being\r\nadjacent to the city. For the last twenty years his transactions have been\r\nvery heavy, having made of land belonging to him wholly, or in part, in\r\nthe city of Cleveland and its environs, thirty-one recorded sub-divisions,\r\ncovering an area of five hundred acres, on which he has personally, or in\r\nconnection with others interested with him, opened and named no less than\r\nseventy-six streets, including the well-known Croton, Laurel, Greenwood,\r\nHumbolt, Mahoning, Kelly, Lynden, Maple, Mayflower and Siegel streets, and\r\nLongwood avenue. He was also largely instrumental in opening Prospect\r\nbeyond Hudson, and sold nearly half of the land on Kinsman street, besides\r\nselling a large amount of land on Superior and St. Clair streets; also on\r\nthe West Side, Madison avenue, Long street, Colgate street and Waverly\r\navenue. He has sold in all 3000 lots in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoyt united with the Baptist church in Utica in 1835. Soon after\r\ncoming to Cleveland he became connected with the First Baptist church\r\nSunday school, and was its superintendent twenty-six years, when he\r\nresigned, and became teacher of a congregational Bible class, which labor\r\nof love he has performed for about three years, and still continues.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, he was licensed to preach the Gospel, by the church with which he\r\nwas connected. He was never ordained, and never contemplated being, but\r\nsimply desired to testify to Christian truth as a business man on the\r\nprinciple of \"He that heareth, let him say come.\" For the past fifteen\r\nyears he has labored in that capacity more or less in nearly all the\r\nProtestant denominations in the city and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, he was elected President of the Ohio Baptist State Convention,\r\nand has been re-elected annually ever since, and has held anniversaries\r\nin nearly every city of the State. In 1866, he was elected president of\r\nthe American Baptist Home Mission Society, being the national\r\norganization for missions for North America, has been re-elected\r\nannually, and still holds the office. Through all this time Mr. Hoyt has\r\nmade many public addresses, and given lectures on both secular and\r\nreligious subjects, in addition to publishing a number of articles,\r\nreviews and other literary work.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1836 to Miss Mary Ella Beebe, in the city of New York.\r\nOf this marriage have been born six children, five of whom are living. The\r\noldest daughter, Mary Ella, died in 1854, aged fourteen. The oldest son,\r\nWayland, is in the Baptist ministry, and is now pastor of the Strong Place\r\nBaptist church, Brooklyn, N. Y. The second son, Colgate, is now clerk and\r\nassistant in his father's business. The daughter, Lydia, is the wife of\r\nMr. E. J. Farmer, banker of this city.\r\n\r\nWe do not think it is exaggeration to say, that not a man in the city has\r\nmore entwined himself with the affection of the people than Mr. Hoyt. For\r\nmany years he has had the power to do untold evil to the poor, and to do\r\nit with a show of justice and legality, but this power was never\r\nexercised. Of the thousands of lots sold by him, a very large proportion\r\nhave been for homesteads for the poor, hundreds of whom became involved\r\nthrough sickness, or other misfortunes, and were not able to make payments\r\nwhen due; many men died and left encumbered homes for widows to struggle\r\non with, but they never lacked a friend in James M. Hoyt. Other creditors\r\nwould sometimes crowd such persons, but to the extent of his ability he\r\nalways kept them at bay, and if the load was in any case too heavy, would\r\nsell for the embarrassed owners, and give them the benefit of the rise in\r\nproperty. Time and again have we heard such things from the grateful poor.\r\n\r\nHe is liberal with his means, contributing freely for religious and\r\ncharitable purposes. In politics he has ever sided with the party of\r\nprogress, and, although not a politician, has added his means and\r\nexertions to the cause whenever necessary. During the war against the\r\nrebellion he was an energetic supporter of the Government, and rendered\r\nvaluable aid to the cause of loyalty by his money and influence.\r\n\r\nMr. Hoyt, since his retirement from the legal profession, has devoted much\r\ntime to those liberal studies which are too apt to be neglected amid the\r\nengrossing engagements of the Bar. He is a ripe scholar in English\r\nhistory, and especially in the period between the Revolution of 1688 and\r\nthe accession of the House of Hanover. With an eminently practical turn of\r\nmind, he is not disinclined to meta-physical investigations, and we well\r\nremember the enthusiasm and keen zest with which he passed many winter\r\nevenings at the house of a friend in reading, analyzing, and applying the\r\ncanons of criticism to Burke's Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful. His\r\narticle on Miracles, published in the October number, 1863, of the\r\nChristian Review, contains one of the most searching examinations of\r\nHume's doctrines extant. It presents a vexed subject in a new and striking\r\nlight, and offers an unanswerable argument to the sophistries of the great\r\nskeptic. The article has been widely circulated and much admired for its\r\nlogical acumen, and its striking simplification of an apparently complex\r\nsubject. With the faculty, in a large degree, of presenting abstract truth\r\nin a form plain, attractive and intelligible to the common understanding,\r\nit is to be hoped that Mr. Hoyt will continue to contribute to the higher\r\ndepartments of our periodical literature, and thus by his studies and his\r\npen add to his present usefulness in his daily avocation, for we seldom\r\nfind one blessed with such a versatility of talent. He is methodical in\r\neverything, and thorough in everything. In short, he is a good lawyer, a\r\ngood preacher, a good citizen, a good business man, a good father, a good\r\nneighbor, and a true friend. He is now only fifty-four years of age, both\r\nmentally and physically vigorous, and we sincerely hope his life of\r\nusefulness may be extended many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin T. Backus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin T. Backus, was born in Lee, Berkshire county, Massachusetts, May\r\n6th, 1813. He was the son of Thomas and Rebecca Backus. While Franklin T.\r\nwas very young, his father removed to Lansing, New York, where he shortly\r\ndied, leaving a large family of young children to the care of his\r\nsurviving widow, with limited means for their support and education. In\r\nconsequence of this, the subject of this sketch was early in life inured\r\nto hardy exercise upon a farm, to which, in after life, he has attributed\r\nhis strong constitution, and ability to endure confinement, and the\r\nseverest mental toil incident to an extensive legal practice.\r\n\r\nIt would be inappropriate in a brief sketch, to refer to and narrate\r\nincidents of boyhood days, and they are therefore passed over. Mr. Backus,\r\nwhile in early youth, became possessed of an unconquerable desire for\r\nknowledge, and while laboring with his hands, his mind was busy\r\ndetermining how he should secure the advantages of education. No\r\nsuperficial acquirements could satisfy him. Added to native talents, of a\r\nhigh order, were thoroughness and perseverance in everything which he\r\nresolved to undertake, and these traits applied particularly to him as a\r\nstudent. After resolving to obtain a thorough classical education, he set\r\nabout it in earnest, and in an unusually short period of time, prepared\r\nhimself, and on examination, entered the junior class of Yale College in\r\n1834. Though the only time actually spent in college was during his junior\r\nand senior years, yet his standing was very high, and he graduated at Yale\r\nin 1836, occupying a position of one of the best mathematicians in his\r\nclass. Soon after, he was tendered the position of assistant professor, or\r\ninstructor in that venerable institution, an honor accorded to but few in\r\nso short a time after graduation.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Yale, Mr. Backus settled in Cleveland, Ohio, where he\r\nestablished a classical school, which at once became very popular and\r\nsuccessful, and shortly afterwards commenced the study of law with\r\nMessrs. Bolton & Kelly, who were among the leading members of the\r\nCuyahoga county Bar.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1839, he was admitted to the practice of law at Cleveland, the\r\nSupreme Court then being in session there, and entered at once upon the\r\npractice of his profession, in which, from the beginning, he took a high\r\nposition. He was also an active politician, and as a member of the Whig\r\nparty, participated largely in its active operations in the State, as well\r\nas in his own district, and was frequently a recipient of its honors.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, he was elected to the office of prosecuting attorney of Cuyahoga\r\ncounty, having been nominated to that office in a contest in which several\r\nwho were older and more experienced in the profession than he, were\r\ncandidates. His administration of the office was in the highest degree\r\nable and successful, and so met the approval of the public, that he was\r\nrenominated by his party and elected for the second term of two years.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1842, Mr. Backus was married to Miss Lucy Mygatt, daughter of\r\nGeorge Mygatt, Esq., then of Painesville, now of Cleveland. The choice was\r\na most suitable and wise one, and Mrs. Backus still lives, the light and\r\njoy of their home.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Mr. Backus was elected as a member of the House of\r\nRepresentatives in the Ohio Legislature, and continued there only one\r\nterm, refusing a renomination. In 1848, he was elected to the Senate of\r\nOhio, in which he took a commanding position, and was widely talked of\r\namong his friends in various parts of the State as a suitable candidate\r\nfor the United States Senate, as well as for the House of Representatives\r\nin Congress.\r\n\r\nFrom the breaking out of the Rebellion to its close, he was as strenuous\r\nan advocate as any one could be, of putting down the Rebellion at any\r\nhazard of blood and treasure, but differed widely as to some of the\r\nmeasures and policy adopted by the Government, and consequently, did not,\r\nat, or about the close of the war, act with the Republican party, nor has\r\nhe since; and though not an active politician, he is now generally\r\nrecognized as a member of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, Mr. Backus associated himself in the legal practice with J. P.\r\nBishop, Esq., with whom he continued for fifteen years. Mr. Bishop was\r\nafterwards chosen one of the judges of the Court of Common Pleas of the\r\nCleveland district. Afterwards, for several years, he was associated with\r\nthat able jurist, Judge R. P. Ranney, and now, for some years, he has been\r\nassociated with E. J. Estep, Esq., in his profession.\r\n\r\nThat he stood high in his profession in the State as well as in Cleveland,\r\nis shown by the fact that he was nominated, by the Whig party, as\r\ncandidate for Supreme Judge of Ohio, and afterwards by the Republican\r\nparty for the same office, but failed of an election because the party\r\nnominating him was unsuccessful each of those years in Ohio.\r\n\r\nMr. Backus' life for the last twenty years has been almost exclusively\r\ndevoted to his profession. When the railroads were projected which made\r\nCleveland one of their terminations he embarked in the enterprise of their\r\nlocation and construction, and was early retained as their attorney and\r\ncounsel, and has been acting as such to the present time. The Cleveland,\r\nColumbus & Cincinnati Railroad, from the beginning, so far as legal\r\nservices have been required, has been under his special supervision. His\r\nknowledge of the department of law appertaining to corporations, and his\r\nability as a corporation lawyer, it is believed, is not surpassed. The\r\nsame may be said of him as a land lawyer, especially in regard to all\r\nquestions arising in the northern part of this State. In short, Mr. Backus\r\nhas had a very wide and varied experience in almost every branch of legal\r\npractice, and in every case in which he has suffered himself to be\r\nretained, he has made it a principle to be thorough and accurate, and to\r\npossess himself of a full knowledge of his case in all its aspects.\r\n\r\nAs a summary as to Mr. Backus as a lawyer, it is the opinion of those best\r\nacquainted with him and his professional ability, acquirements and\r\nexperience, that, as a whole, he is unsurpassed by any in the State.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the great enterprises of the city his advice and\r\nco-operation have been sought, and where legal advice and aid have been\r\nrequired, his services have often been called into requisition by the\r\ncity. He not only has occupied the position professionally, before spoken\r\nof, but has, and does, still occupy high positions of trust, both for the\r\ncity and individuals, and in such matters it may be safely said, there are\r\nfew men living in whom more implicit confidence is reposed.\r\n\r\nThe extent of his varied legal practice can only be judged of in part, by\r\nhis appearance in court. His business out of court has constituted by far\r\nthe largest and most important part of his practice, and has always been\r\ndone with a view to saving his client from litigation in future, so far as\r\npossible, and this he has accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn pecuniary matters Mr. Backus has been successful, not only as the\r\nfruits of arduous professional labors, but in other respects.\r\n\r\nMr. Backus is a very benevolent and liberal man, also, but his generosity\r\nis not in the beaten track. It is bestowed unseen and unknown by the\r\npublic, and his own judgment selects the object of his bounty. His\r\nfriendship when once bestowed is undying and changes not with time or\r\ncircumstances so long as the person on whom it is bestowed proves worthy\r\nof his confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly, J. P. Bishop]\r\n\r\n\r\nJesse P. Bishop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Bishop was born in New Haven, Vermont, June 1, 1815, and was taken\r\nwith his father's family to St. Lawrence county, New York, whilst yet a\r\nchild. His father died when he was but nine years old, and his mother\r\nreturned to Vermont, taking her children with her. As soon as he was of\r\nage to be serviceable, he was apprenticed to a farmer until his\r\nfourteenth year, at the expiration of which time he resided with an uncle\r\nuntil his seventeenth year, when he left farm work in order to acquire an\r\neducation. He studied hard for four or five years, partly maintaining\r\nhimself by teaching school, and at length had prepared himself for a\r\ncollegiate course.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, he came to Cleveland, and after an experience in a counting-room\r\none season, he concluded that he was better adapted for a literary life.\r\nAccordingly he entered Western Reserve College, and on examination was\r\nadmitted to the senior class.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, he began the study of law with Hon. Rufus P. Spalding, afterwards\r\nwith Andrews, Foote & Hoyt, and subsequently with Varnum J. Card, and was\r\nadmitted to practice August, 1839, when he immediately entered into\r\npartnership with Mr. Card, who, however, died about one year later, and\r\nMr. Bishop formed a partnership with F. T. Backus. This business connection\r\ncontinued fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Mr. Bishop was elected to the Common Pleas Judgeship of this\r\ncounty and district, and served with great satisfaction both to members\r\nof the profession and to the public. His decisions were characterized by\r\na painstaking research, and an exhaustless consideration of the\r\nprinciples of law involved, indicating a clear, accurate and\r\ndiscriminating mind. It is believed that very few of his decisions were\r\never reversed by a higher court, which is of itself sufficient testimony\r\nto his ability and industry. At the end of his term he declined being a\r\ncandidate, and at once resumed the practice of law. In this he still\r\ncontinues, having associated with him Seymour F. Adams, recently of the\r\nLewis county Bar, New York.\r\n\r\nMr. Bishop's life has been one of constant application to business, having\r\nno idle time, and scarcely any leisure moments. With him a decision is not\r\nreached by intuition, but by careful study, but when he takes hold of a\r\nsubject he studies it thoroughly to its conclusion, and is master of all\r\nits points. Although Mr. Bishop has never been what may be termed\r\nphysically robust, he possesses great power of prolonged mental\r\napplication. And being also endowed with a most remarkably retentive\r\nmemory, his mind is stored with a very comprehensive knowledge of law. And\r\nif there be one faculty of his mind more than another, that gives\r\ncharacter to the man, it is his prodigious memory of facts. In a case that\r\nrecently came under our notice, Judge Bishop gave evidence pertaining to a\r\nmatter that occurred some twenty years since, with apparently as much\r\nprecision as if the events occurred but yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn social and religions circles Judge Bishop ranks high. He is agreeable\r\nin private life, and thoroughly conscientious in moral and religious\r\nmatters. He has long been a valued and honored member of the Baptist\r\ndenomination. By his uprightness of character, courtesy of demeanor, and\r\ngeneral good qualities, he has won the respect and esteem of a very\r\nlarge circle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry H. Dodge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the very earliest settlers in Cleveland, was Samuel Dodge, the\r\nfather of the subject of this notice, who emigrated from Westmoreland, New\r\nHampshire, to this place, in 1797, being then about 21 years of age. On\r\narriving at Cleveland he built a log shanty, and remained about one year,\r\nwhen he went to Detroit, and remained about the same length of time, and\r\nreturned to Cleveland, which he considered his home. Here and in the\r\nadjoining township he resided to the day of his death, which occurred\r\nOctober 3d, 1854, aged 78 years. About seven years after coming to\r\nCleveland he married a Miss Nancy Doan, of Connecticut, who died in\r\nCleveland, December 19th, 1863, leaving two sons, George C. and Henry H.\r\n\r\nIt is said that Samuel Dodge built the first frame building in this city,\r\nabout the year 1800, and which was a barn for Governor Samuel Huntington,\r\nat that time living at Painesville. His proper business was that of a\r\nwheelwright, but adapted himself to all kinds of wood-work in the new\r\ncountry. During the war of 1812, he took a contract of Major Jessup, the\r\ncommander at this point, for building a large number of boats for the\r\nGovernment, both here and at Erie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Respectfully Yours, Henry H Dodge]\r\n\r\nHenry H. was born August 19th, 1810, and enjoyed what educational\r\nadvantages Cleveland afforded, finishing his education under Hon. Harvey\r\nRice. At the age of twenty he commenced the study of law with Hon. John\r\nW. Willey. In 1835, he married Miss Mary Ann Willey, a niece of Mr.\r\nWilley, of which marriage seven children were born. Mrs. Dodge died\r\nFebruary 4, 1867.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodge was admitted to the Bar at the same time with H. V. Willson and\r\nH. B. Payne, in 1834. He at once entered into partnership with Mr. Willey,\r\nand continued with him until the latter was elected to the president\r\njudgeship of the Court of Common Pleas, in 1840. Mr. Dodge then withdrew\r\nfrom the practice of law to devote his whole attention to the duties of a\r\ndisbursing agent of the United States, for public works, to which he had\r\nbeen appointed two years previously. He held that position until 1841. He\r\nwas also commissioner of insolvents during 1837 and 1838.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, he was appointed State engineer, having charge of public works,\r\nand retained the position until 1855. On the organization of the United\r\nStates District Court for Northern Ohio, he was appointed United States\r\nCommissioner, and held that office for three years. In 1859, he was again\r\nappointed State engineer, and continued as such until 1862, since which\r\ntime he has devoted himself wholly to his real estate interests, opening\r\nup new streets, building tenement houses, and materially aiding in the\r\ngrowth and beauty of the eastern portion of the city. As early as 1837, he\r\nbuilt the large brick block on the corner of Ontario and Prospect streets,\r\nformerly known as the Farmers' Block, which was, at that time, one of the\r\nlargest in the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodge, through all his offices of trust as well as private business,\r\nhas maintained a character for integrity and honor. He is unassuming and\r\naffable, and well calculated to enjoy the handsome competency accruing\r\nfrom the rise of his early real estate purchases, and being of a\r\nremarkably kind and benevolent disposition, one of his chief pleasures\r\narises from the consciousness of doing good, by assisting those who are in\r\nneed, to the extent of his ability. During the war he was most active in\r\nthe country's cause, and spent his time and means freely in furnishing\r\nsubstitutes and rendering comfort to the families of our brave defenders,\r\nand we think, more than anything else, this desire to promote the\r\nprosperity and happiness of mankind, gives character to him.\r\n\r\nMr. Dodge has resided on Euclid avenue over thirty years, having built\r\nthe residence now owned by General Oviatt, adjoining the present residence\r\nof Mr. D. P. Eells, in 1838, the site at that time being outside the city\r\nlimits. After a few years he sold this to Thomas Bolton, and in 1840,\r\nbuilt a brick cottage opposite Brownell street, which he occupied about\r\nfifteen years, when it gave place to the present edifice, the land having\r\nbeen in the family since the year 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames M. Coffinberry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJudge Coffinberry is a native of Mansfield, Ohio, having been born in that\r\ntown in 1818. He studied law with his father, Andrew Coffinberry, Esq.,\r\nthen located at Perrysburg, in the western part of the State, and upon his\r\nadmission to the Bar in 1841, opened a law office in connection with his\r\nfather in Maumee City. He very early obtained the public confidence, being\r\nappreciated for his high personal and professional integrity, and giving\r\nevidence of fine abilities as a lawyer and advocate, he was elected and\r\nserved as prosecuting attorney for Lucas county for several years. About\r\nthe year 1845, he removed to Hancock county, and purchased and edited the\r\nFindlay Herald, a Whig paper of that day, and for about ten years\r\npracticed his profession with credit and success in the large circuit of\r\nHancock, Allen, Putnam, Van Wert, and Wood counties.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, he removed to Cleveland, where he entered very readily into a\r\ngood practice, and for six years confirmed the good reputation which he\r\nbrought with him, and took high rank at a Bar which numbers among its\r\nmembers sortie of the best lawyers in the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, he was elected judge of the Court of Common Pleas, and performed\r\nthe duties of the office for his full term of five years, with credit to\r\nhimself and to the eminent satisfaction of the public, and an appreciative\r\nBar. The kind and genial traits are characteristics of Judge Coffinberry's\r\nmind, and his quiet manners upon the Bench made it always agreeable for\r\nboth lawyers and suitors doing business in his court. His charges to the\r\njury were always plain, clear, and forcible, and in the course of his\r\njudicial service, he delivered some very able opinions, verbal and\r\nwritten, which elicited the favorable consideration of the profession, and\r\nit is understood that no judicial opinion pronounced by him has ever been\r\nreversed on review of a higher court. The charge to the jury on the trial\r\nof Dr. John W. Hughes, for the murder of Tamzen Parsons, of Bedford, which\r\ntook place in December, 1865, was acknowledged by the Cleveland Bar to be\r\none of the ablest ever delivered from the Cuyahoga Bench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, J. M. Coffinberry]\r\n\r\nJudge Coffinberry is remarkable for an apparently intuitive perception of\r\nlegal truth, which gives to his argument at the Bar, and as a lawyer and\r\njudge, to his opinions, a tone of originality. He has a fine appreciation\r\nof the learning of the profession, but though not, strictly speaking,\r\ntechnical in his administration of the law, he is never unmindful of its\r\nnicest distinctions, but makes them subservient to his broad and liberal\r\nviews of the case. He has now returned to the practice of his profession,\r\nand is regarded as among the best advocates of the Cleveland Bar.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Coffinberry has won distinction as a lawyer, the following\r\nrecord will show that he is amongst our most enterprising and energetic\r\nbusiness men, outside of his profession: He is president of the Midas\r\nInsurance Company; a director in the Willow Bank Coal Company; a director\r\nof the Tuscarawas Iron and Coal Company; was one of the projectors of the\r\nPeople's Gas and Coke Company, of the West Side; has been a director of\r\nthe Mahoning Railroad Company; director and attorney for the Fremont and\r\nIndiana Railroad Company; took an active interest in the construction of\r\nthe West Side street railroad, and also the Rocky River Railroad; he was a\r\nmember of the City Council for two years, and president of that body.\r\n\r\nIn politics, he was formerly a Whig, but now acts with the Democrats. He\r\nwas principal Secretary of the Great Union Convention that nominated the\r\nlate David Tod for Governor.\r\n\r\nJudge Coffinberry has been successful in almost every undertaking, and has\r\nrichly deserved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Mason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo member of the Cleveland legal fraternity stands higher in the respect\r\nof his colleagues and the general public, both for legal abilities and\r\npersonal qualities, than James Mason. As a lawyer he stands in the front\r\nrank of the profession, his extensive reading, well balanced judgment, and\r\nlogical reasoning, making him one of the most reliable counsellors and\r\nsuccessful practitioners, whether before a court or a jury, whilst no more\r\nvaluable or respected citizen is found among the list of residents of\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason was born in the Autumn of 1816, in Canton, Ohio, of Vermont\r\nstock, his parents having early emigrated to this State. He was carefully\r\neducated at a good school in Trumbull county, and spent two years in\r\nWestern Reserve College. In 1835, he entered the senior class in Jefferson\r\nCollege and graduated with the class of 1836.\r\n\r\nOn leaving College he studied law with Hon. A. W. Loomis, in New Lisbon,\r\nOhio, and was admitted to the Bar in 1839, when he practiced in\r\npartnership with his preceptor until 1845. With the close of this\r\npartnership he went abroad and spent some time in foreign travel,\r\nreturning in 1851, when he removed to Cleveland and opened a law office.\r\nHis abilities and assiduous attention to business soon brought him a\r\nlarge and remunerative practice. Among other business he became the\r\nlegal adviser of the Cleveland & Toledo Railroad Company, and also one\r\nof its directors. The value of his connection with the company was\r\nspeedily recognized and acknowledged. Business of the highest class came\r\nto him until he has come to find his time fully occupied by the best\r\nclass of practice.\r\n\r\nThe duties of his profession, though laborious, are not allowed to engross\r\nthe whole of his time to the exclusion of domestic pleasures and social\r\nenjoyments. The general culture of Mr. Mason's mind, in addition to his\r\nlegal attainments, and his affable manner, make him an agreeable companion\r\nfor social intercourse, and together with his sterling qualities as a man,\r\nand his patriotism as a citizen, have won for him a host of friends warmly\r\nattached to him, and loyally resolved to do him honor.\r\n\r\nMr. Mason was married in 1853, to Miss Caroline Robinson, of Willoughby.\r\nOf this marriage there are five children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel R. Tilden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Daniel R. Tilden has long been familiar in Cleveland and its\r\nvicinity. For fifteen years he has held the office of Probate Judge of\r\nCuyahoga county, and from the nature of his office, has been brought into\r\nconnection with a large proportion of the citizens, and become intimately\r\nacquainted with their personal and family affairs. Many of these business\r\nacquaintances became warm personal friends, and it is believed that\r\nneither by his official, nor by his private life, has Judge Tilden made\r\none real enemy.\r\n\r\nMr. Tilden was born in Lebanon, Connecticut, November 5th, 1806, He\r\nreceived a fair common school education, and on reaching his eighteenth\r\nyear, left his native State for the South, residing four years in North\r\nCarolina and Virginia. But the South was not a congenial soil for the son\r\nof the genuine Yankee State, so he turned his steps westward, and set out\r\nfor Ohio. At Garrettsville, Portage county, he halted awhile, and then\r\nwent to study law with Mr. Pierson, at Ravenna. To complete his legal\r\neducation, he entered the office of R. P. Spalding, and studied with him\r\nfor some time.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, a movement was on foot to agitate the question of abolishing\r\nslavery. The movement was exceedingly unpopular, and it required\r\nconsiderable nerve to profess abolition sentiments. Now, when no other\r\nprinciple is avowed, it scarcely seems possible that men, now among us in\r\nthe prime of life, had to endure obloquy, ridicule, and even danger, for\r\nexpressing sentiments that no one now dreams of dissenting from. Among the\r\nfirst to espouse the abolition doctrines was Judge Tilden. With Robert F.\r\nPaine he commenced the work of organizing an Abolition Society in\r\nGarrettsville, the first of the kind in Portage county. In this work he\r\nlabored with unwearied zeal, and became extensively known as one of the\r\nmost prominent and active of anti-slavery leaders.\r\n\r\nIn 1832, Mr. Tilden was elected justice of the peace, and continued in\r\nthat office four years; soon after the conclusion of the term, he formed a\r\nlaw partnership with Judge Spalding, at Ravenna. This arrangement\r\ncontinued about four years, when he formed a partnership with W. S. G.\r\nOtis, which lasted about three years, and was terminated by Judge Tilden\r\nbecoming prosecuting attorney, an office he held four years.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, Judge Tilden was elected to Congress as a Whig, from the district\r\ncomposed of Summit, Portage, and Trumbull counties, and was in the House\r\nof Representatives during the exciting debates relative to the annexation\r\nof Texas and the Mexican war. He, with twelve others, took a bold stand\r\nagainst the war, making several speeches of very marked ability. He and\r\nhis associates, among whom were Gov. Vance, Columbus Delano, and Joseph\r\nRoot, refused to vote for the bill furnishing means to carry on the war,\r\nbecause of the preamble to the bill, which said: \"Whereas, we are, by the\r\nact of Mexico, become engaged in war,\" &c., &c. This, Judge Tilden and his\r\nassociates considered false, they would not vote for the bill until it was\r\nstricken out, and the names of these thirteen were sent throughout the\r\ncountry surrounded with a funeral border.\r\n\r\nAt the Baltimore Convention that nominated General Scott, Judge Tilden\r\nrepresented Lake and Summit counties; and at the Philadelphia Convention\r\nthat nominated Taylor, he represented Summit, Trumbull, and Portage.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, Judge Tilden removed to Cleveland and formed a law partnership\r\nwith Hon. H. B. Payne. Two years afterwards he was elected Probate Judge,\r\nof Cuyahoga county, and filled the position with such marked satisfaction\r\nto his constituents that he was re-elected at the close of every term, and\r\nstill holds the office he has filled for fifteen consecutive years.\r\n\r\nWhen practicing law, Judge Tilden was distinguished for his abilities as\r\nan advocate, and his qualifications for the judicial office he fills is\r\nattested by his repeated re-elections to it. His officiai conduct has been\r\nmarked by uniform kindness, attention to the duties of his office, and the\r\ninterests of those having business with it, and a constant endeavor to do\r\nright by all, whether rich or poor, learned or ignorant. If he has\r\ncommitted any errors--and no Judge, from the Supreme Court down, but must\r\nplead guilty to some--they have been errors of judgment only, and not of\r\ninterest. No one can deny to Judge Tilden unimpeached honesty of purpose,\r\nwarmth of heart, and an earnest endeavor to deal justly with all men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, C. M. Palmer]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles W. Palmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProminent among the young men of the profession who promise to take\r\nand worthily fill the places of the old leaders of the Cleveland Bar\r\nnow partly superannuated and soon to retire from active life, is\r\nCharles W. Palmer.\r\n\r\nMr. Palmer was born in Norwich, New London county, Connecticut, September\r\n8, 1826. Nine years after, his father, Joseph B. Palmer removed to\r\nCleveland with his family, and was for a time engaged in the storage\r\nbusiness on the river. He is now in the employ of the Cleveland &\r\nPittsburgh Railroad Company. Charles had only the advantages of the common\r\nschools until he was sixteen, but before he reached that age he had\r\nmanifested an industry at his books which promised well for his future. He\r\ntaught school on \"the ridge\" West of Cleveland, walking out to the school\r\nhouse and back before and after school hours, and at the same time\r\nprosecuting his own studies. He prepared for College under Rev. S. B.\r\nCanfield and W. D. Beattie, of Cleveland, and when nearly eighteen was\r\nadmitted to Western Reserve College at Hudson. He graduated in 1848, with\r\nthe highest honors of his class. For two years after graduation he was\r\nprincipal of the High School in Akron, and the next year a tutor in\r\nWestern Reserve College. Coming to Cleveland again after this, he studied\r\nlaw in the office of Judge Foote, and was admitted to the Bar in the Fall\r\nof 1853. In the Spring of the following year he made his first success in\r\npolitical life, being elected to the City Council. In the Spring of 1859,\r\nhe was elected city attorney. The duties of this office he discharged\r\nsatisfactorily to all, and found the practice it brought a material help\r\nin his profession. In the Fall of 1863, Mr. Palmer was elected prosecuting\r\nattorney for the county. Here he was brought very prominently into notice\r\nby the successful prosecution of several important cases.\r\n\r\nIn his profession, Mr. Palmer has been a constantly rising man, until now\r\nhe is on one or the other side of most of the important cases in our\r\ncourts. His reputation as a criminal lawyer is especially high. In 1865,\r\nhe prosecuted the celebrated Hughes murder case successfully. Two years\r\nafterwards he defended McConnell, the murderer, and in 1868, defended\r\nMrs. Victor, in one of the most remarkable poisoning cases ever brought\r\ninto court. His argument in the latter case was a masterpiece of legal\r\nacumen, forcible exposition, and polished speech. Mr. Palmer began the\r\npractice of law in Cleveland in the firm of Palmer & Austin. Afterwards he\r\nwas associated with R. B. Dennis, Esq., and at present he is senior in the\r\nfirm of Palmer & De Wolf.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1819, Mr. Palmer married Miss Sabrina Parks, of Hudson, Ohio.\r\nThis estimable lady died in little more than a year after the marriage,\r\nleaving a son but a few weeks old. The son still survives. In 1855, Mr.\r\nPalmer married Miss Minerva Stone, a sister of Mr. S. S. Stone, of\r\nCleveland. This second wife died in childbed eleven months after marriage,\r\nand in 1858, Mr. Palmer married his present wife. She was Miss Lucy\r\nHubbell, a daughter of Calvin Hubbell, Esq., of New York. By this marriage\r\nthere is a son now about ten years old.\r\n\r\nIn politics, Mr. Palmer has been a member of the Republican party since\r\nits organization. He gave the war for the Union an earnest, active and\r\npowerful support. No man appreciated more thoroughly the principles\r\ninvolved in that contest, and few indeed have the power to present those\r\nprinciples so well as he. His party services have been numerous and\r\nefficient. A man of fine personal appearance, with a fair, open face,\r\nwhich carries with it the conviction of sincerity in all he says,\r\npossessed of a grace of manner which makes it a pleasure to hear him on\r\nany subject, and having such a command of language as to enable him to put\r\nhis thoughts in the fittest words, he is of course a favorite speaker\r\nalways. He has a conscientiousness in all he does, which never allows him\r\nto treat carelessly any matter, even in an unexpected public speech. There\r\nare few men in Cleveland who carry so much weight in speaking, whether it\r\nbe before a court and jury, or to a general assembly of people. Taking an\r\nintelligent interest in all public affairs, he yet devotes himself\r\nstudiously to his profession, in which he has as bright prospects as any\r\nman at his age need wish for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Collins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Collins was born at Lowville, New York, the county seat of Lewis\r\ncounty, February 22, 1818. He was a son of Ela Collins, who was a son of\r\nGeneral Oliver Collins, of Oneida county, New York, and Maria Clinton,\r\ndaughter of Rev. Isaac Clinton, of Lowville.\r\n\r\nMr. Collins read law with his father, and was admitted to practice in the\r\ncourts of New York, at Rochester, in September, 1813. In October, 1843, he\r\nformed a copartnership with his father, under the firm name of E. & W.\r\nCollins. They continued in active and successful practice until the death\r\nof his father, in 1849. Immediately after Mr. Collins' admission to the\r\nBar, he was elected, as the successor of his father, public prosecutor.\r\nThis office he held until 1846, when he resigned, having been elected, by\r\nthe Democratic party, in November, 1846, at the age of twenty-seven, a\r\nmember of the House of Representatives, in the Thirtieth Congress. The\r\ndistrict represented by him was composed of Lewis and St. Lawrence\r\ncounties. He was in Congress in the years 1847-8-9, during the first\r\nagitation of the question of extending slavery to the free territories.\r\nMr. Collins opposed the proposed extension with much zeal and ability.\r\nAmong his speeches will be found one delivered July 28, 1848, on the \"Bill\r\nto establish the territorial government of Oregon,\" advocating the Wilmot\r\nProviso. Apart from its merit as a brilliant literary production, it\r\ncontains many passages that will be read with much interest by the general\r\nreader, as showing the beginning of the end at which we have arrived.\r\nSlavery itself having now become a matter of history, we think it will be\r\nof interest to introduce the following extracts from the Congressional\r\nGlobe of July, 1848:\r\n\r\n  I shall assume, then, sir, that the institution does not exist in our\r\n  late Mexican acquisitions, but that it has been effectually prohibited.\r\n  The real question, then, is shall the laws securing _freedom_ in these\r\n  Territories be abolished, and _slavery_ established? This is indeed,\r\n  sir, a question of the gravest magnitude. To millions of the oppressed\r\n  and degraded children of Africa, it is an issue upon which depends all\r\n  that is dear to them in life--all that is bitter in the hour of death.\r\n  It seems to me, sir, that they are even now stretching forth their dark\r\n  hands, and beseeching us, in the name of the God of liberty whom our\r\n  fathers worshipped, to remove from them the poisoned cup of bondage--to\r\n  forge for them no more chains. The termination of this question also\r\n  involves the dearest interests of every person in this country who\r\n  desires to sustain himself by honorable labor. It intimately concerns\r\n  our national honor, reputation, and progress in the great family of\r\n  nations. The two hundred and fifty thousand immigrants who annually land\r\n  upon our shores are in pursuit of 'free soil and free labor.' Can we\r\n  pronounce in favor of slavery, without danger to our experiment at\r\n  self-government? If we thus decide, what will become of the cherished\r\n  hopes of the friends of civilization, Christianity, and human progress?\r\n\r\n  Those who insist upon preserving freedom in the Territories, have no\r\n  desire to disturb the institution of slavery in the States. The\r\n  Constitution confers upon them no such authority. They could not\r\n  interfere with it if they would, and they would not if they could. They\r\n  have ever heretofore been, and still are, ready strictly to fulfil the\r\n  constitutional provisions upon this subject.\r\n\r\n  I shall aim to discuss this question with a proper regard for the most\r\n  sensitive feelings of our brethren of the slave States, but also, sir,\r\n  with a plainness commensurate with its profound importance. The\r\n  legislatures of thirteen of the States of the Union, including Delaware,\r\n  which still has two thousand slaves, have passed resolutions instructing\r\n  their Senators and requesting their Representatives in Congress to\r\n  oppose any further extension of slavery. There is but one sentiment upon\r\n  this subject throughout the free States--it is that of eternal and\r\n  _uncompromising_ hostility to the project. They will never consent that\r\n  the free and virgin soil of the Territories shall be blighted and cursed\r\n  by the tears of the slave, while they have a will to determine, or a\r\n  muscle to resist.\r\n\r\n  The proposition to make this Government the instrument for planting\r\n  slavery upon soil now free, is regarded by a few at the North as so\r\n  improbable and monstrous, that they have refused to believe that it is\r\n  seriously entertained. Startling as the proposal is, it is nevertheless\r\n  true.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Another argument employed by these apologists is, that the 'Proviso,' or\r\n  a law prohibiting slavery in these Territories, is unnecessary; that it\r\n  is an abstraction--a 'firebrand' employed by demagogues and factionists\r\n  to kindle strife in the Democratic party; that the Territories are now\r\n  free, and that they will so continue, unless an act of Congress is\r\n  passed establishing slavery. It is impossible to avoid asking ourselves\r\n  why, if these gentlemen are sincere--if they truly believe that slavery\r\n  can not and will not go there, and they do not desire that it\r\n  should--why they so strenuously oppose the passage of such a\r\n  prohibition? If their views are correct, then such a law would be a mere\r\n  harmless superfluity. But, sir, this '_firebrand of freedom_' is a thing\r\n  more exalted and noble than a mere abstraction. It is wielded by men of\r\n  strong arms, adamantine will, and hearts animated by the divine impulses\r\n  of patriotism and liberty. They have registered a vow in Heaven to\r\n  employ every lawful and constitutional means to roll back the dark tide\r\n  of slavery from the temple of Freedom, and vindicate the character of\r\n  the Republic from the disgrace and reproach of establishing slavery in a\r\n  free territory. We are no abstractionists. The Representatives in this\r\n  Congress from the fifteen slaveholding States of the Union, without an\r\n  exception, and without distinction of party, avow an intention to carry\r\n  their slaves into these Territories, and there hold them in bondage.\r\n  They assert, with passionate vehemence, that they have such a\r\n  constitutional right. They have even told us, sir, that, regardless of\r\n  the remonstrances of the people of the North--heedless of any\r\n  prohibitory law of Congress upon the subject, they would invade the free\r\n  soil of the Pacific, and take with them their slaves, and weapons of\r\n  defence! Are these declarations abstractions? Do they make no appeal for\r\n  immediate, energetic and prohibitory legislation?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W. Collins]\r\n\r\n  When driven from every other argument, gentlemen of the South\r\n  threaten, that if the 'Proviso' or a law prohibiting slavery in free\r\n  territory, is passed, they will dissolve the Union. At the North, the\r\n  dissolution of the Union is not regarded as among possible events. Its\r\n  value is never calculated. It has been cemented by too many common and\r\n  glorious sacrifices and struggles; it is protected by too many pious\r\n  invocations of its magnanimous founders, to be easily severed. The\r\n  cause by which these fraternal bonds are sundered must be other than a\r\n  refusal on the part of the free States to allow the Government to\r\n  establish slavery in free territory. A submission to the will of the\r\n  majority is a fundamental principle of our institutions. If the North\r\n  are overborne in this contest, they must and will submit. If the\r\n  demands of the South are denied by the decision of the majority, a like\r\n  cheerful and ready acquiesence is expected. Until, however, the\r\n  majority have decided, no legal and constitutional efforts to exclude\r\n  slavery from these Territories will be abated by passionate threats\r\n  against the peace and perpetuity of the Union. The Union would never\r\n  have been formed had the present demand of the slave States been made\r\n  and insisted upon. A proposition in the Constitutional Convention to\r\n  make the Government a propagandist of slavery in free territory, would\r\n  have been indignantly rejected.\r\n\r\n  Whilst we stand here, upon the floor of the American Congress, at the\r\n  noon of the nineteenth century, gravely discussing whether or not we\r\n  will extend and perpetuate slavery, the monarchical governments of\r\n  Europe are striking off shackles and 'letting the oppressed go free.'\r\n  Slavery has been abolished by the French colonies. Portugal, Spain,\r\n  and Russia, are moving in the work of emancipation. Within a few\r\n  years England has given liberty to eight hundred thousand slaves. She\r\n  has expended, within the last forty years, one hundred millions of\r\n  dollars in suppressing the slave trade. Is it reserved for the\r\n  Government of 'free, happy America,' in the midst of examples like\r\n  these, to be fastening corroding chains upon human beings? Sooner\r\n  than be involved in such stupendous guilt, let our name and existence\r\n  perish among the nations.\r\n\r\n  On the part of the North no 'compromises' can be made. But one answer--a\r\n  stern, unyielding NO--will be given to all such proposals. We have\r\n  made all the concessions that we can make, or ought to make. If a law\r\n  under the name of a 'compromise' is passed, planting slavery upon a\r\n  single square mile of free territory, it will have no rest. REPEAL! will\r\n  be shouted from the mountain tops of the North, and reverberated in\r\n  thunder tones through the valleys. The preservation of 'free soil for\r\n  free men,' will alone be satisfactory. For this purpose, the passage of\r\n  an act of Congress prohibiting slavery in free territory, will be\r\n  unceasingly urged, until the great measure is consummated.\r\n\r\nDuring this Congress, although the anti-slavery-extension men were in a\r\nminority in both branches, all compromise bills were defeated, and their\r\ndefeat was due in a good degree to the industrious and vigilant efforts of\r\nMr. Collins, and a few associates in the House.\r\n\r\nMr. Collins was tendered a renomination to the thirty-first Congress, but\r\nhaving determined to remove to the West, he declined, and Preston King was\r\nelected in his stead. He continued, with much success, the business of\r\nthe late firm of E. & W. Collins, until December, 1853, when he removed to\r\nCleveland and opened a law office. He was soon elected a director of the\r\nMerchants Bank of Cleveland, and of the Lake Shore Railway Company.\r\nSubsequently he became a director in the Bellefontaine Railway Company;\r\nthe Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway Company; the\r\nJamestown and Franklin Railway Company, of Pennsylvania; the East\r\nCleveland Street Railroad Company; the Mercer Iron and Coal Company, of\r\nPennsylvania, and the Merchants National Bank, of Cleveland, the active\r\nduties of which positions have absorbed very much of his attention and\r\ntime. He has occasionally appeared in the courts here in litigated cases,\r\nbut has mainly confined his professional work to his office. Mr. Collins\r\nhad a high standing as a lawyer in New York, and has fully sustained his\r\nearly reputation here. He is most remarkable for an admirably fair and\r\nclear way of stating and arguing to the court and jury, the questions both\r\nof law and fact. This contributed greatly to his success, not only as a\r\nforensic advocate, but as a political orator, and legislative debater.\r\n\r\nThe sympathies of Mr. Collins having always been on the side of freedom,\r\nhe joined the Republican party on its organization, and has remained\r\nfaithful to its principles. When the Rebellion broke out he threw himself\r\nheartily into the cause of the Union, and contributed freely with money\r\nand labor in every available way for the furtherance of the Union cause.\r\nHe served on the local military and other committees, working faithfully\r\nand energetically, and contributing largely to the excellent record\r\nCleveland and the county made during the war, by repeatedly and promptly\r\nfilling the quota of troops required, and by liberal contributions in aid\r\nof the sick and wounded soldiers. Whenever an effort was needed, the voice\r\nof Mr. Collins was heard exhorting the people earnestly to energetic\r\naction and liberal contributions, and his exhortations were promptly and\r\nefficiently seconded by his own example. With him precept and practice\r\nwent together.\r\n\r\nSuch men as Mr. Collins would do the people valuable service were they\r\nchosen to fill responsible places in the legislative councils and\r\nexecutive departments of the State and Nation. But in these days something\r\nmore than--or it may too often be said--something different from abilities\r\nof the description possessed by Mr. Collins, seems to be required to\r\nsecure the favor of the people, or rather of the political managers. He is\r\nof too ingenuous a nature to yield to the intrigues and servility, too\r\noften, now-a-days, demanded of political candidates by the managers.\r\n\r\nOn November 20th, 1816, Mr. Collins was married at Columbus, to Jane,\r\nsecond daughter of the late Alfred Kelly--the two families having been\r\nearly neighbors and friends in New York. Two children of this marriage\r\nsurvive, Frederick and Walter, the former seventeen years of age at the\r\npresent time, and the latter fourteen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRufus Percival Ranney.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRufus P. Ranney, one of the most profound jurists this country has\r\nproduced, was born at Blandford, Massachusetts, October 30, 1813. His\r\nfather, Rufus Ranney, was an honest, industrious farmer, of Scotch\r\ndescent. His mother, whose maiden name was Dottie D. Blair, came from\r\nrevolutionary stock.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1822, Rufus Ranney removed with his family to Ohio. After a\r\nshort stay at Fairport, Lake county, they finally located at Freedom,\r\nPortage county, where they made a permanent settlement upon a farm. It was\r\nthere that Rufus P. Ranney spent the years of his early manhood, and there\r\nhis parents lived until their decease. Judge Ranney's father was highly\r\nrespected in the neighborhood where he lived, and, though in humble\r\ncircumstances, did all within his power for the education of his children,\r\ntraining them in the pathway of honesty and integrity--traits of character\r\nwhich have marked the public and private career of his distinguished son.\r\nHis mother, an amiable woman who had received a good education, was very\r\nattentive to her children, and her son, Rufus P. doubtless owes much of\r\nwhatever he has been in life to her early teachings.\r\n\r\nUntil he became of age, Rufus P. Ranney was engaged upon his father's\r\nfarm, obtaining, during the winter season, a few weeks education at such\r\nschools as a country village then afforded. He attended the college at\r\nHudson for a season, but circumstances prevented his remaining long enough\r\nto graduate with his class.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1835, having determined to make a start in life for himself,\r\nhe left his home and traveled on foot to Jefferson, Ashtabula county. In a\r\nspeech made by him at Ashtabula in September, 1868, he referred to the\r\ntime of his arrival at Jefferson, his worldly goods consisting of the\r\nclothing upon his person, and _one_ extra shirt, which he carried in the\r\ntop of his hat.\r\n\r\nEntering the office of Benjamin F. Wade, he applied himself with\r\ndiligence to the study of the law, and after a clerkship of one year was\r\nadmitted to the Bar. Soon afterward he entered into partnership with his\r\npreceptor. The firm of Wade & Ranney was a powerful one, and \"ruled the\r\ncircuit\" of North Eastern Ohio. For several years it enjoyed an extensive\r\npractice. The firm was dissolved upon the removal of Judge Ranney to\r\nWarren, (1844,) and Mr. Wade was soon afterward chosen President Judge of\r\nthe Third Judicial District, from which position he was transferred to the\r\nSenate of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, and again in 1848, Judge Ranney was an unsuccessful candidate for\r\nCongress. In the Trumbull district the Whig party was largely in the\r\nmajority, and though Judge Ranney was defeated, he ran considerably ahead\r\nof the general ticket, reducing the Whig majority to hundreds, when\r\nbefore, that party had triumphed by thousands.\r\n\r\nThe people having determined that a convention be held to form a new\r\nconstitution, Judge Ranney was chosen to represent the counties of\r\nTrumbull and Geauga. The convention was held in 1850. It was composed of\r\nthe first men of the State; both parties seem to have vied with each other\r\nin sending their ablest representatives. There were William Medill, its\r\nPresident, who afterwards became Governor of the State; the venerable\r\nEx-Governor Vance; Henry Stanbery, late Attorney General of the United\r\nStates; Peter Hitchcock, for thirty years a judge of the Supreme Court;\r\nBenjamin Stanton, long a member of Congress; Judges Joseph E. Swan,\r\nSherlock J. Andrews, Simeon Nash and William Kennon; Charles Reemelin,\r\nD. P. Leadbetter, William Sawyer, and others not less prominent in the\r\nJudicial and political annals of Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn that convention, Rufus P. Ranney greatly distinguished himself.\r\nAlthough but thirty-six years of age he commanded the respect and\r\nadmiration of all its members, and won for himself a high reputation as a\r\nsound lawyer and ready debater. No one was more looked to for advice, and\r\nnone more generally correct in giving it. He was, in fact, a leader, whose\r\ncouncil, in almost every instance, was acceded to by the convention. All\r\nthe propositions which he introduced were for the welfare and benefit of\r\nthe people. In the official report of the debates will be found his views\r\nupon nearly or quite all of the questions which agitated the convention.\r\nHe was the champion of the people against monopolies, and many of the most\r\nimportant provisions in the constitution are the work of his hand.\r\n\r\nThe course which he pursued met the hearty approval of the people and\r\nmade his name prominent throughout the State. In response to the wishes of\r\nthe members of the legal profession, and the general desire of the public,\r\nhe was, by the legislature of 1851, chosen one of the judges of the\r\nSupreme Court. When the new constitution went into effect, he was elected\r\nto the same position by a large majority.\r\n\r\nJudge Ranney occupied a place upon the Supreme Bench until 1856, when he\r\nresigned on account of ill health. That year he was a member of the\r\nCincinnati National Convention, which nominated James Buchanan for\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1857, Judge Ranney, unsolicited on his part, received from\r\nPresident Buchanan the appointment of United States Attorney for the\r\nNorthern District of Ohio. This position he held until July, when he\r\nresigned. He then removed to Cleveland, where he resumed the practice of\r\nhis profession, as a member of the firm of Ranney, Backus & Noble.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, Governor Chase tendered him the appointment of commissioner to\r\nexamine and report upon the condition of the State Treasury, this being\r\nsoon after the Gibson-Breslin defalcation, by which the State lost several\r\nhundred thousand dollars. Judge Ranney declined this appointment. The same\r\nyear he was unanimously nominated by the Democratic State convention as\r\nthe candidate of that party for Governor--his opponent on the Republican\r\nticket being the Hon. William Dennison, of Franklin county, late\r\nPost-Master General of the United States. After a most gallant canvass,\r\nJudge Ranney failed of an election, though he ran ahead of the other\r\ncandidates on the ticket in all parts of the State.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, against his personal wishes, he was nominated by the Democracy\r\nfor Judge of the Supreme Court. He consented to be a candidate only\r\nafter the convention had _positively refused_ to accept his declination.\r\nThe Republican nominee was his law partner, the Hon. Franklin T. Backus,\r\none of the most prominent members of the Cuyahoga Bar. The result was\r\nthe election of Judge Ranney by a decided majority, and although party\r\nlines were closely drawn, he again ran ahead of his ticket several\r\nthousand votes.\r\n\r\nHe held the position of judge of the Supreme Court until 1864, when he\r\nresigned. Some months afterwards he resumed the practice of his profession\r\nin connection with his son-in-law, Mr. T. Kelley Bolton.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, (1864) he was chosen one of the delegates at large\r\nto the Democratic National Convention, which nominated George B.\r\nMcClellan for President, and was selected by the Ohio delegation as the\r\nmember from Ohio of the Democratic National Committee, holding that\r\nposition until 1868. In the late Presidential campaign, his name headed\r\nthe Democratic electoral ticket. This closes his public record. It is an\r\ninteresting one, and though briefly given, exhibits this fact, viz.: the\r\nconfidence and regard in which he has ever been held by the Democracy of\r\nOhio. Year after year his voice has been heard throughout the State in\r\ndefence of the Constitution and laws, and the honors which his party have\r\nbestowed upon him, are but a merited tribute to his energy, ability, and\r\nintegrity of character.\r\n\r\nAs a lawyer, Judge Ranney has ever held the front rank in his\r\nprofession. His practice has been extensive and important; probably no\r\nattorney in the State has, during the past ten years, been retained in\r\nas many cases. Possessed of a strong, discriminating mind, capable of\r\nenduring long continued mental labor, he unites with activity and energy\r\na determined spirit, which enables him to overcome obstacles which would\r\nappal most men.\r\n\r\nJudge Ranney is as logical as eloquent, and when his great reasoning\r\npowers are brought into full sway, formidable must be the opponent to\r\novercome him. His arguments in court are peculiarly appropriate, clear,\r\ncalm, and strong; without wordy declamation, vehement gesture, or\r\npassionate appeal; he seldom fails to carry his point, even when the odds\r\nseem overwhelmingly against him.\r\n\r\nJudge Ranney has a mind richly stored with not only the treasures of his\r\nprofession, but of ancient and modern classics, and the best literature of\r\nthe day. He is a great reader, and though he writes but little, whatever\r\nproceeds from his pen is marked by elegance and culture.\r\n\r\nAs a Judge, he was courteous, affable and indulgent. His decisions are his\r\nbest _monuments_. They exhibit profound learning, sound judgment and\r\nextensive research. No judge was more popular upon the Bench. Dignified\r\nand benevolent, he enjoyed in an eminent degree the confidence of the Bar\r\nand the public. He had the constant respect of those who differed from him\r\nin opinion, and when he resigned his seat upon the Bench, the best men of\r\nall parties expressed regret at his retirement from a position which he\r\nhad so much adorned. Pre-eminent in legal knowledge, Rufus P. Ranney has\r\nreflected honor upon the judiciary of our country, and is one of the\r\nablest of the many learned men who have graced the Supreme Bench of our\r\nState with their presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, C. T. Sherman]\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Taylor Sherman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sherman family was among the earliest settlers in Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut. They and their descendants were men of note in their\r\nrespective Colonies, of strong, practical minds, pure and lofty in moral\r\ntone and character.\r\n\r\nThey were early actors in the settlement and development of Ohio. Taylor\r\nSherman, the grandfather of the subject of this sketch, was a judge of\r\none of the Superior Courts of Connecticut, and was one of the trustees of\r\nthe Fire Land Company, to whom was granted, by the State of Connecticut,\r\nthe lands now comprised by the counties of Huron and Erie, in Ohio. As\r\nearly as 1800, he was in Ohio, and also in subsequent years, attending to\r\nthe surveying and allotting the lands to the owners, who suffered from\r\nfire in the excursions of Arnold and Tryon, in Connecticut, in the\r\nRevolutionary war.\r\n\r\nHis son, Charles R. Sherman, and father of Charles T. Sherman, emigrated\r\nto Ohio in 1810, and settled in Lancaster, Fairfield county, Ohio. He\r\nearly became distinguished at the Bar, among the strong and able lawyers\r\nthen practicing in Central Ohio. In 1824, he was elected one of the judges\r\nof the Supreme Court of Ohio, and died in 1830, whilst in the performance\r\nof his duties.\r\n\r\nCharles T. Sherman, of whose life these notes are made, was born in\r\nLancaster, February 3, 1813, and is Ohio born and reared. He was educated\r\nand graduated at the Ohio University, in Athens, Ohio, in 1832, and\r\nadmitted to the Bar in 1835. He settled in Mansfield, Richland county,\r\nand continued in the practice of his profession until he was appointed\r\njudge of the United States Court for the Northern District of Ohio, in\r\nMardi, 1867.\r\n\r\nHe never sought to obtain any public office, but rather carefully avoided\r\nit. He always esteemed it fortunate that he resided in a county and\r\nsection in which the majority was opposed to him in political sentiments.\r\nHe however took a leading part in developing and forwarding public\r\nimprovements in his county. He contributed liberally by his labors and\r\ninfluence in locating and constructing through his county the Pittsburgh,\r\nFort Wayne & Chicago Railroad, and the Mansfield & Sandusky Railroad. For\r\nmany years he was a director in both roads, and general soliciter of the\r\nPittsburgh, Fort Wayne & Chicago Railroad, and a leading spirit in its\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nHe was also appointed by Mr. Lincoln to serve four years as one of the\r\nGovernment Directors of the Pacific Railroad, and largely contributed to\r\nits success in its early days.\r\n\r\nThe Bar of Richland county always ranked among the first in Northern Ohio.\r\nAmong the oldest members who were in full practice when Judge Sherman went\r\nthere, were Jacob Parker, afterwards Judge of the Common Pleas, Andrew\r\nCoffinberry, one of the most genial and kind hearted men, and, withal, an\r\nexcellent lawyer, John M. May, who commenced the practice of the law in\r\n1815, and is still living, and James Purdy, Orris Parrish of Columbus,\r\nWilliam Stanbery, of Newark, Hosmer and Henry B. Curtis, of Mt. Vernon,\r\nand Edward Avery, of Wooster, afterwards Judge of the Supreme Court, all\r\npracticed in that county. In later days and cotemporaneous with Judge\r\nSherman, were Thomas W. Bartley, Jacob Brinkerhoof, and Josiah Scott, all\r\nof whom occupied the Bench of the Supreme Court of Ohio, James Stewart,\r\nJudge of the Common Pleas, S. J. Kirkwood, afterwards Governor of Iowa, and\r\nU. S. Senator from that State, together with R. G. Hurd and Columbus\r\nDelano, of Mt. Vernon, and C. L. Boalt and J. M. Root, of Norwalk.\r\n\r\nJudge Sherman ranked with those later and younger members of the Bar, and\r\nenjoyed a practice equal to any, and more lucrative probably, than any of\r\nthem. He was quiet and unostentatious in his profession, and, seemingly,\r\nonly sought to do his whole duty to his clients and obtain the good will\r\nof his fellow citizens.\r\n\r\nA short time after the breaking out of the rebellion, he was appointed\r\nProvost Marshal of some twenty counties in Northern Ohio, by the War\r\nDepartment, and organized four regiments that went into the service, and\r\nsubsequently served on a commission to settle and adjust claims on the\r\nGovernment arising in the West.\r\n\r\nUpon his appointment to the Bench he resigned his position on the\r\nRailroads, with the intention of devoting his whole time to the duties of\r\nhis judicial office. For more than two years he has presided with entire\r\nsatisfaction to the public and the members of the Cleveland Bar, proving\r\nhimself to be a strong, capable, common-sense, business judge; and by his\r\nhabitual courteous demeanor has made a host of legal and other friends\r\nduring his short residence in this city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Respectfully, R. P. Spalding]\r\n\r\n\r\nRufus P. Spalding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a work professing to deal with the \"representative men\" of Cleveland,\r\nit is eminently proper that he who has represented the interests of\r\nCleveland in Congress for six years with a fidelity unsurpassed by any of\r\nhis predecessors in the national councils, and who won for the district he\r\nrepresented a prominence hitherto not accorded to it, should find a\r\nconspicuous place. The six years' service of Judge Spalding in Congress as\r\nthe Representative from the Eighteenth Ohio District forms a period in the\r\nhistory of the city of which the citizens, irrespective of party\r\npredilections, have reason to be proud.\r\n\r\nRufus Paine Spalding is a native of Massachusetts, having been born on the\r\n3rd of May, 1798, at West Tisbury, on the island of Martha's Vineyard. The\r\nremote ancestor of the Spaldings was Edward Spalding, who is recorded as\r\nhaving been \"made a Freeman\" at Braintree, Massachusetts, in 1640. Edward\r\nSpalding's son Benjamin emigrated from Massachusetts to Connecticut about\r\nfifteen years after that date, and settled in Plainfield, Windham county.\r\nThe great grandson of Benjamin Spalding, and the father of Rufus Paine\r\nSpalding, Dr. Rufus Spalding, had in 1798, been for some time a resident\r\nof West Tisbury, where he practiced medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen his son was fourteen years old Dr. Spalding removed to Connecticut\r\nand resided in Norwich. Rufus P. Spalding, having been prepared for\r\ncollege, entered Yale at the proper time, and graduated in 1817, with the\r\ndegree of Bachelor of Arts. The class in which he graduated contained\r\nnames that afterwards acquired lustre in judicial, legislative, and\r\necclesiastical circles.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Mr. Spalding's tendency was towards the legal profession,\r\nand immediately on leaving college he prepared himself by study for the\r\npractice of the law. He was fortunate in the choice of an instructor,\r\nhaving entered the office of the Hon. Zephaniah Swift, Chief Justice of\r\nConnecticut, who is known to the profession as the learned author of the\r\n\"Digest.\" He profited so well by the instructions he received, that, on\r\nhis leaving the office, Judge Swift complimented him highly on his\r\nproficiency, and predicted for the young lawyer a successful career, if he\r\nremained true to his profession. On completing his term of reading law,\r\nand being admitted to the Bar, he left New England to push his fortune in\r\nthe West, and in December, 1819, reached the old \"Post of Arkansas,\"\r\nremoving soon after to Little Rock, where he put out his shingle as a\r\nlawyer, in partnership with Samuel Dinsman, who has since reached the\r\ngubernatorial chair of New Hampshire. Here he remained about a year and a\r\nhalf, when he turned his face eastward, and in passing through Ohio,\r\nstopped at Warren, the county town of Trumbull county. Here he was induced\r\nto remain, the chances of practice being represented as good, and his\r\nprofound knowledge of law, ability in making that knowledge serviceable,\r\nand unwearied industry, enabled him to soon build up an extensive legal\r\nconnection, which he retained and increased during his sixteen years stay\r\nin Warren.\r\n\r\nFrom Warren he removed to Ravenna, in the adjoining county of Portage. He\r\nhad not long been in the county before the people recognized the abilities\r\nand power of Mr. Spalding, and he was chosen to represent that county in\r\nthe State Legislature. The contest for the position was sharp, for Mr.\r\nSpalding was a new man in the county, and it was considered by many proper\r\nthat older residents should represent so important a constituency. But the\r\nrecognized ability of Mr. Spalding outweighed all objections on the ground\r\nof recent residency, and he was elected by a majority of one.\r\n\r\nDuring his term in the Legislature, and mainly through his efforts, the\r\ncounty of Summit was erected, and Mr. Spalding at once became a resident\r\nof the new county by removing his place of residence to Akron. At the next\r\nelection he offered himself as a representative of Summit in the\r\nlegislature, and was accepted. On the organization of the House of\r\nRepresentatives he was chosen speaker, and won the approbation of the\r\nwhole body by the ability and impartiality with which he presided over the\r\nproceedings. During this term of office the question of repudiating the\r\nState debt was broached. Mr. Spalding took strong ground against such a\r\ncourse, holding it not only disgraceful but suicidal. In this he was\r\nsupported by the late John Brough, then Auditor of State, and largely\r\nthrough the bold and persistent opposition of these gentlemen the scheme\r\nwas dropped.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislative session of 1848-9, the two houses of the General\r\nAssembly united in electing Mr. Spalding a judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe State for the constitutional term of seven years. But when four years\r\nof the term remained unexpired, the operation of the new constitution\r\nended the pending terms of all offices, and devolved the election of\r\nSupreme Court judges upon the people instead of on the General Assembly.\r\nJudge Spalding declined being a candidate for the office in a popular\r\ncanvass, and so the advantages of his ripe legal and judicial knowledge\r\nwas lost to the Bench of the State. Concurrent testimony shows that no\r\ndecisions were held in greater respect by the lawyers and the public, for\r\ntheir uprightness and justice, whilst to the legal fraternity in\r\nparticular, they commended themselves by their logical force, and terse,\r\nclear, emphatic style and precision of expression that rendered them\r\nmodels of judicial literature. His judicial opinions are contained in\r\nvolumes 18, 19 and 20 of the Ohio Reports.\r\n\r\nOn his retirement from the Bench of the State, Judge Spalding returned to\r\nthe practice of the law with renewed ardor. Cleveland, presenting a wider\r\nfield for the exercise of his abilities, he removed to that city and at\r\nonce took front rank among the many able members of the profession. His\r\nprofound knowledge of the law, power as a debater, and his ability of\r\ncreating a strong impression on both courts and juries, built up for him\r\nan extensive and lucrative practice. When he spoke he carried conviction,\r\nit being all but impossible to resist the solid array of arguments and\r\nterse, incisive style. The same characteristics that made him afterwards\r\nso powerful in Congress had great effect on the most intelligent juries,\r\nand exercised a marked influence on the judges engaged in trying the\r\ncauses in which he was interested as advocate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law claimed his first attention, and was his choice, Judge\r\nSpalding was no indifferent spectator of the course of politics. He had\r\nbeen trained a Democrat, and was a powerful worker in that party. But all\r\nhis convictions were on the side of justice and freedom, and when, in\r\n1850, the Fugitive Slave Law wedded Democracy to slavery, Judge Spalding,\r\nin common with thousands of others, broke through the party traces, and\r\njoined the \"Free Soil\" party, opposed to the extention of slavery. At the\r\nFree Soil convention of 1852, he was an active and prominent delegate, and\r\non his nomination, John P. Hale was made the candidate for the Presidency.\r\n\r\nOn the formation of the Republican party, pledged to the restriction of\r\nthe slave power, Judge Spalding took an active part in carrying out the\r\nprinciples of that organization. He was a member of the Pittsburgh\r\nConvention of 1856, at which the party was organized, and was a delegate\r\nat large for the State of Ohio at the Philadelphia Convention that\r\nnominated John C. Fremont. From that time he labored earnestly for the\r\nsuccess of Republican principles, and the good effect of his efforts\r\nwere frequently acknowledged by the party.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1862, he was chosen to succeed Mr. Riddle as Representative of\r\nthe Eighteenth Congressional District in Congress. The wisdom of the\r\nchoice was almost immediately made manifest. Judge Spalding had not long\r\noccupied his seat in the House of Representatives before \"the member from\r\nthe Cleveland District\" became noticed for the interest he took in\r\nquestions of importance, the soundness of his views, and the ability with\r\nwhich they were urged. He took part in all the leading debates, and with\r\nsuch effect that he commanded the attention of the House whenever he\r\nspoke, and the leaders listened respectfully to his suggestions. He was\r\nappointed a member of the Standing Committee on Naval Affairs, and of the\r\nCommittee on Revolutionary Pensions, and on the formation of a Select\r\nCommittee on the Bankrupt Law, he was made its Chairman. In committee he\r\nwas noticeable for his punctuality, patient and conscientious attention to\r\nthe drudgery of committee work, and the system with which he was enabled\r\nto despatch large amounts of it satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, he was re-elected to his seat, and in that term was made a member\r\nof the Standing Committee on Appropriations, and retained his former\r\nposition on the Committee on Bankruptcy, the chairmanship of which was\r\nheld by Mr. Jenckes. In this Congress Judge Spalding took a leading part\r\nin the important debates on the subject of Reconstruction, and impressed\r\nhis influence on the Legislation upon this matter. In the early days of\r\nthe session he made a speech, in which he indicated the measures he\r\nregarded best adapted for the for the purpose of properly reconstructing\r\nthe rebel States. The speech attracted great attention, both within and\r\nwithout Congress, and the suggestions therein contained were for the most\r\npart subsequently adopted, and worked into the Reconstruction Laws. The\r\nmilitary features of Reconstruction, which formed an integral part of the\r\nlegislation, originated in an amendment proposed by Judge Spalding, when\r\nthe first Reconstruction Bill of Thaddeus Stevens was presented.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, he was again re-elected to Congress, his national services, as\r\nwell as his fidelity to the local interests of his constituents, having\r\nsecured for him that distinguished compliment. In this Congress he\r\ncontinued to occupy a prominent position, and was recognized as one of the\r\nleading men on the Republican side, though not so thoroughly partizan as\r\nto accept all the measures proposed in the name of the Republican party.\r\nHe differed occasionally with the dominant section of the party, when he\r\nbelieved their zeal outran discretion and sound policy, and the judgment\r\nof the country has in most cases pronounced him to have acted rightly. In\r\nthis Congress he served on the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee\r\non the Revision of the Laws of the United States, and upon the Joint\r\nCommittee on the Library of Congress. In the debates on the financial\r\nquestions that enlisted the attention of Congress at this session he took\r\na leading part, and in May, 1868, he delivered a speech on \"The Political\r\nand Financial condition of the Country,\" which took strong ground against\r\nthe unconstitutionality of the Legal Tenders, whilst approving the passage\r\nof the Legal Tender Act as a measure of military necessity at the time.\r\nWith this Congress Judge Spalding's legislative career closed. The duties\r\nof the position, always faithfully performed by him, were growing too\r\nonerous, and at his time of life, though still full of activity and\r\nhealthy vigor, it was urged that he should enjoy more ease than was\r\npossibly consistent with his idea of a proper fulfillment of the trust of\r\nmember of Congress. He therefore wrote a letter to his constituents\r\nseveral months before the period of nomination, positively declining a\r\nrenomination, and withdrawing from public life.\r\n\r\nThe determination of Judge Spalding to withdraw from active political life\r\nwas a matter of surprise and regret to his colleagues in Congress, who had\r\nlearned to value his sound judgment, ripe scholarship, earnest patriotism,\r\nand great legislative ability. It was a positive loss to the people of the\r\nEighteenth Ohio District, for never had the interests of that district\r\nbeen better cared for. To Cleveland, especially, he proved in reality a\r\nrepresentative member. The wishes of his constituents were promptly\r\nattended to, their interests carefully guarded, and no stone left unturned\r\nin the endeavor to benefit the city and its people. In the Congressional\r\nsession and out of it, he was ever on the watch for opportunities to\r\nadvance the interests of his constituents, and in complying with the daily\r\nrequests for advice and assistance, he did so, not grudgingly or\r\nreluctantly, but with earnestness and hearty good will, as if it were a\r\nmatter of his own personal concern. The withdrawal of Judge Spalding from\r\npublic political life, was a loss to the national councils in which he had\r\nachieved distinction, but was a still greater loss to the constituency he\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nJudge Spalding has returned to the legal profession, of which he ranks\r\namong the brightest lights, and finds in its practice, and in the quiet\r\nenjoyment of social and domestic life, a satisfaction which his public\r\ncareer, brilliant as it was, failed to give. In his seventy-second year,\r\nhe is yet in the full enjoyment of all his faculties, physical and mental,\r\nand is the picture of sound health and mental vigor.\r\n\r\nJudge Spalding has been married twice. In October, 1822, he was married to\r\nLucretia A. Swift, oldest daughter of his preceptor in legal studies.\r\nSeven children were born of this marriage, of whom but three yet live:\r\nCol. Zeph. S. Spalding, United States Consul at Honolulu, Brevet Captain\r\nGeorge S. Spalding, First Lieutenant 33d U. S. Infantry, and Mrs. Lucretia\r\nMcIlrath, wife of Charles McIlrath, of St. Paul, Minnesota. In January,\r\n1859, Judge Spalding was married to his present wife, oldest daughter of\r\nDr. William S. Pierson, of Windsor, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. S. C. Otis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. S. C. Otis was born in Cummington, Hampshire county, Massachusetts,\r\nAugust 24th, 1808. His father was a farmer in narrow circumstances, who,\r\nowing to the loss of property, was able to bestow upon his children only\r\nsuch an education as could be obtained in the district schools of a purely\r\nagricultural district. Books were scarce, and as poor in quality as meagre\r\nin quantity; but being a lad with literary tastes, a desire for\r\ninformation, and an omnivorous appetite for reading, every book that fell\r\nin the way of young Otis was eagerly seized and its contents ravenously\r\ndevoured. The life of a poor farmer, with its ceaseless drudgery and petty\r\nneeds, was distasteful to the lad, and he was anxious to obtain a\r\ncollegiate education, and thus become fitted to fight the battle of life\r\nwith brain instead of muscle. His ambition was not discouraged by his\r\nfather, but there was a great difficulty in the way of its\r\ngratification--the want of money. Mr. Otis was utterly unable to give his\r\nson any pecuniary assistance, though ready to resign his claim on his\r\nson's time; an important sacrifice when the demands of a large family and\r\nthe straitness of his means are taken into consideration. Application was\r\nmade for admission to West Point Military Academy, but unfortunately a\r\nCongressman's son was also a candidate for the appointment, and of course\r\nthe friendless son of a poor struggling farmer had to go to the wall. This\r\nwas a heavy blow and sore discouragement.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject of this sketch was about seventeen or eighteen years old\r\nhis father emigrated to Ohio, leaving his son behind with only forty\r\ndollars in money, who, after making arrangements with his brother, W. A.\r\nOtis, to furnish him such pecuniary aid as he might need, proceeded to fit\r\nhimself for college under the Rev. Roswell Hawks, of Cummington, devoting\r\nonly one year to preparation, and entered Williams College in the Fall of\r\n1826. In order to lighten the burden upon his brother, he taught school\r\ntwo Winters during his college course, and graduated in the autumn of\r\n1830, among the best scholars of the class.\r\n\r\nBefore graduating, he was appointed principal of Gates' Academy, in\r\nMarlborough, Massachusetts, and entered upon the duties of the\r\nappointment; but at the expiration of the year he followed the rest of the\r\nfamily to Ohio, and in the month of September, 1831, commenced reading law\r\nwith Whittlesey & Newton, of Canfield, Ohio. In September, 1833, he was\r\nadmitted to the Bar, and immediately commenced the practice of the law in\r\nRavenna, Portage county, where he continued to reside till 1840.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1840, after the county of Summit was organized, Mr. Otis moved to\r\nAkron, where he resided and continued to practice his profession until\r\nJanuary, 1854. While a resident of Summit county he was elected\r\nProsecuting Attorney of the county for two years. He also filled the\r\nposition of president of the Akron Bank, from its organization, till\r\nJanuary, 1854, and was a member of the Board of Control of the State Bank\r\nof Ohio, and member of the Convention which formed the present\r\nConstitution of the State of Ohio. While a member of the Convention he\r\ndevised and reported to that body the scheme for the apportionment of the\r\nmembers of the House of Representatives, which, with slight modifications,\r\nwas adopted into the Constitution, and is now the system in this State.\r\nWhile a member of the Constitutional Convention, he acquired a distaste\r\nfor political life, and resolved to abandon it, a resolution to which he\r\nhas since constantly adhered.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1854, Mr. Otis was elected vice-president of the Cleveland and\r\nPittsburgh Railroad Company, and in order to better perform the duties of\r\nthe position, he removed to Cleveland, taking charge of the operations of\r\nthe road and the finances of the Company. In the Winter of 1854 and 1855,\r\nhe was tendered the presidency of the Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad\r\nCompany, but declined, and in the Spring of 1855, resumed the practice of\r\nhis profession. Soon afterwards he was elected the Solicitor of the\r\nCleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad Company, and continued to act as such\r\nuntil he resigned the position in May, 1869, and since that time he has\r\nconfined himself strictly to the practice of law.\r\n\r\nAs a lawyer Mr. Otis ranks high in his profession, having a very extensive\r\nknowledge of the law in all its ramifications, and a readiness in the\r\napplication of his knowledge that enables him to baffle and confound his\r\nopponents without descending to mere pettifogging.\r\n\r\nFor many years he has been a member either of the Congregational or\r\nPresbyterian churches in the places in which he has resided; and has\r\nalways taken great pleasure in studying the Bible, and great satisfaction\r\nin teaching it to others, hence the secret of the spotless morality and\r\nunswerving integrity he has maintained through life.\r\n\r\nMr. Otis was married in January, 1836, to Hannah, daughter of the late G.\r\nMygatt, and sister of George Mygatt, of Cleveland. She died without issue\r\nin April, 1840. In November, 1842, he was married to Laura L., daughter of\r\nthe late Judge Lyman, of Ravenna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin J. Dickman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFranklin J. Dickman is a native of Petersburg, Virginia, where his\r\nparents have long resided. At the age of sixteen he entered the Junior\r\nclass of Brown University, at Providence, Rhode Island, and at the age of\r\neighteen graduated with the salutatory honors of his class. In the same\r\nclass were the Hon. S. S. Cox, Lieutenant Governor Francis Wayland, of\r\nConnecticut, and the Rev. James C. Fletcher, now so well known for his\r\ntravels in Brazil.\r\n\r\nOn leaving college Mr. Dickman studied law in the office of the late\r\nCharles F. Tillinghest and ex-Chief Justice Bradley, at Providence, and\r\nafter completing his studies he commenced the practice of his profession\r\nin the same city, continuing with success until he removed to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nHis entry on public life was early. In 1857, the Democracy of Rhode\r\nIsland selected him as their candidate for Attorney General of the State,\r\nand it is a noticeable fact that although running on the Democratic\r\nticket, he received almost the entire colored vote of the State. In 1858,\r\nhe was appointed a member of the Board of Visitors to the Military Academy\r\nat West Point, and was chosen Secretary of the Board. In that capacity he\r\ndrew up the report of the Board for that year, which was subsequently\r\npublished by order of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1858, he removed to Cleveland, rightly considering that its\r\ngrowth and prosperity, and the important cases continually arising out of\r\nits commercial business, rendered it a good field for a man of knowledge\r\nand of energy to put that knowledge to account. He entered on the\r\npractice of his profession with zeal, and speedily reaped his reward in a\r\nlarge business.\r\n\r\nUp to the breaking out of the war Mr. Dickman had acted with the\r\nDemocratic party, but when treason culminated with rebellion, he joined\r\nthose of his political associates who disregarded party lines and united\r\nwith the Republicans in forming the Union party. Although fitted for\r\ncollege with Roger A. Pryor, of Petersburg, and though his parents\r\nremained in Petersburg during the war, Mr. Dickman took strong ground\r\nagainst the rebellion and all who gave it encouragement.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, he was nominated for member of the State Legislature from this\r\ncity, and was elected by a large majority. In that body he was made\r\nchairman of the Committee on Railroads and also placed on the Judiciary\r\nCommittee. In the latter capacity the subject of military arrests came\r\nunder his notice, and his speech on that subject was considered so able\r\nand exhaustive an exposition of that subject that it was published at\r\nthe request of the Judiciary Committee and widely circulated through\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his legislative term he formed a law partnership with\r\nJudge Spalding, which still continues, and re-entered assiduously on the\r\nduties of his profession, devoting most of his attention to admirality,\r\nmarine insurance, and patent cases. In these he has been very successful.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, President Johnson appointed Mr. Dickman United States District\r\nAttorney for the Northern District of Ohio. The appointment was received\r\nwith satisfaction by all shades of political opinions, and Mr. Dickman\r\ncontinued to perform its duties to, the approbation of all having business\r\nwith the court until early in 1869, when he resigned the position in\r\norder to confine himself more closely to his private practice. It is\r\nadmitted on all sides that the duties of his office were faithfully and\r\nably performed. Of the great number of criminal cases brought before the\r\ncourt by him only two escaped conviction, thus evidencing the merit, care\r\nand attention given to the getting up of the cases for trial. Such\r\nuniformity in securing conviction is very unusual.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickman is a gentleman of fine literary tastes, extensive reading, and\r\nrare classical attainments. The relaxation from his legal duties is found\r\nmainly in his library among the highest class of authors. His frequent\r\norations for the literary societies of Brown University and the University\r\nof Michigan, and other occasions, have been marked by scholarly finish and\r\nhave always been received with approval. During the existence of the\r\nKnickerbocker Magazine, before its decadence, he contributed to its pages\r\na series of valuable articles on \"Butler's Horae Juridical,\" and on \"The\r\nRevolution of 1688.\"\r\n\r\nCherishing a high ideal of professional attainments and ability, Mr.\r\nDickman has realized it to a degree remarkable for a young man. With\r\nample acquirements he has clear conceptions, and broad views of the\r\nprinciples of legal science, frequently never attained by older lawyers,\r\neven after a large and life-long practice. His habits of study are wisely\r\nmethodized, so as to husband time, and make his efforts tell without\r\nwaste upon results.\r\n\r\nA very marked feature also in his character, is a rigorous but highly\r\nintelligent economy. Upon a limited practice in Rhode Island, before\r\ncoming to Cleveland, he not only sustained himself, but accumulated a\r\nconsiderable sum as a basis upon which he could rely with honorable\r\nindependence in a new field. This was done in circumstances in which\r\nmultitudes of young men at this day, would by self-indulgence and lavish\r\noutlay, have become embarrassed by debt.\r\n\r\nThe example of a wise economy in one familiar with the first social\r\nsurroundings--an economy supplying means for a rich and broad literary\r\nculture, under the guidance of liberal tastes, yet rigid as to\r\nself-control--but ever avoiding parsimony, is far too rare among young men\r\nin this lavish and wasteful age. The young man who shows what enlightened\r\nself-control, what high probity and fidelity to the details of little\r\nwants and expenditures can do to lift a man high above debt, to thrift and\r\nself-reliance, is a valuable citizen, exerting an influence as wholesome\r\nas it is wise, manly, and rare.\r\n\r\nMr. Dickman, in his mental growth, aims at the solid, rather than the\r\nmerely sensational; the lasting, rather than the transient. Gifted\r\nnaturally with vigorous and admirably balanced powers, the right use of\r\nwhich has enriched him already with ample mental furniture, and with\r\nhabits the most exemplary, and a high character, established upon an\r\nintelligent religions basis, the future to him is full of promise of the\r\nmost honorable achievements.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, Mr. Dickman was married to Miss Annie E. Niel, daughter of Robert\r\nNeil, of Columbus, Ohio, and has two children living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames M. Jones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch is the third son of Thomas and Mary Ann Jones,\r\nwho emigrated from England to the United States, and settled in Cleveland\r\nin the Spring of 1831, where they still reside, They were the parents of\r\nnine sons and four daughters, all of whom, save one son and one daughter,\r\nare still living.\r\n\r\nJames Milton Jones enjoyed only such moderate advantages in the way of\r\neducation as were afforded by the common and high schools of the day, and\r\nby the classical and English school of the late lamented and most\r\naccomplished educator, H. D. Beattie, A. M.; but his memory was good, he\r\nwas a close student, and he therefore readily and easily familiarized\r\nhimself with the studies in which he engaged. He early manifested unusual\r\ntaste and fondness for composition, and his inclination and talent in that\r\ndirection were much cultivated and improved by assiduous study of the best\r\nstandard works in prose and poetry.\r\n\r\nOn leaving school he became interested as a partner in the marble\r\nmanufactory of T. Jones & Sons, and acquired a practical knowledge of the\r\nbusiness, but never applied himself very closely to its duties.\r\n\r\nHe joined various literary and forensic societies about the year 1850,\r\ncomposed of some of the best literary and professional talent among the\r\nyoung men of the city, where essays, poems, and discussions on all topics\r\nof the day were embraced in the order of exercises; and he soon became\r\nmarked for his thorough preparation of and familiarity with the subjects\r\nof debate, and regarded as a speaker of more than ordinary promise.\r\n\r\nHe became a frequent contributor, (but never in his own name,) in prose\r\nand poetry, to the literary, as well as the daily papers of the day, and\r\nespecially to the daily Plain Dealer, of which the late J. W. Gray, Esq.,\r\nwas then the accomplished and witty editor, and by whom Mr. Jones was much\r\nencouraged, and his contributions frequently commended. As specimens of\r\nhis poetic contributions, we give the following. It should be noted that\r\nwith his entry on the actual duties of professional life, Mr. Jones bade a\r\nfinal adieu to the muses:\r\n\r\n      Woodland Reveries.\r\n\r\n      In this deep shady dell,\r\n      Where the soft breezes swell,\r\n  And beautiful wood-sprites by pearly streams wander--\r\n      Where the sweet perfume breathes,\r\n      O'er angel twined wreaths,\r\n  Luxuriantly blooming the mossy trees under--\r\n      Here, beneath the bright vine\r\n      Whose leaves intertwine,\r\n  I'm dreaming of thee, my lost Angeline!\r\n\r\n      Oh! I think of the time--\r\n      Of the warm spring time,\r\n  When with thee I've wandered, and with thee I've dallied;\r\n      E're my soul had once dreamed\r\n      That the roses which seemed\r\n  So fadeless, could leave thy warm cheek cold and pallid,\r\n      Or thy dear form decline,\r\n      From its radiance divine,\r\n  To press the cold grave sod, my own Angeline!\r\n\r\n      While the pale starlight laves,\r\n      With its shadowy waves,\r\n  A brow, that with memory's anguish is throbbing;\r\n      Each quivering leaf,\r\n      Seems trembling with grief,\r\n  That's borne on the zephyr's low sorrowful sobbing.\r\n      For that dear form of thine,\r\n      So oft pressed to mine,\r\n  My angel-claimed lost one, my own Angeline!\r\n\r\n      As the stream leaps along,\r\n      And I list to its song,\r\n  It sounds like the surging of sorrow's dark river;\r\n\r\n      When o'er my young bride,\r\n      Passed its dark rolling tide,\r\n  And bore her away from my bosum forever;\r\n      Yes; bore thee to shine\r\n      In regions divine,\r\n  Resplendently lovely, and pure, Angeline!\r\n\r\n      And _there_, as I gaze\r\n      On its bright sparkling face,\r\n  Where pearly white ripples are merrily gleaming,\r\n      Reflecting each star\r\n      That shines from afar,\r\n  The face of my lost one seems tenderly beaming;\r\n      Yes! there beside mine,\r\n      Are thy features benign,\r\n  By memory mirrored, my own Angeline!\r\n\r\n      As I gently recline,\r\n      'Neath the clustering vine,\r\n  The veil from futurity's vista is lifted,\r\n      And adown life's wild tide,\r\n      I rapidly glide,\r\n  And into eternity's ocean am drifted;\r\n      And there, soul of mine\r\n      In regions divine,\r\n  I meet thee, to part _nevermore_, Angeline!\r\n\r\n\r\n    A Wreck! A Wreck! \"Man the Life Boat.\"\r\n\r\n  The blackness of midnight hung over the ocean,\r\n    And savagely, shrilly, the Storm Spirit screamed.\r\n  Athwart the dark billows, which wild in commotion,\r\n    Sublimely, yet awfully, heavenward streamed.\r\n\r\n  A bark that but rode from her moorings at morning,\r\n    'Neath bright sunny skies, and prosperous gales,\r\n  With streamlet and banner, in beauty adorning\r\n    Her tapering masts and snowy white sails,\r\n\r\n  Now rolls in the trough of the tempest-plowed surges!\r\n    A wreck! madly urged to a rocky bound shore;\r\n  Where from the dark jaws of wild ocean emerges,\r\n    To fear-stricken hearts its ominous roar\r\n\r\n  Her sails are in ribbons, her banners in tatters!\r\n    Her masts are afloat from the perilous wreck,\r\n  And now o'er the billows the Tempest Fiend scatters\r\n    With one mighty effort her hurricane deck!\r\n\r\n  The voice of the clarion-toned captain is ringing,\r\n    Above the hoarse murmuring roar of the surge,\r\n  And an echoing voice, seems sepulchrally flinging,\r\n    Far back o'er the waves, for the vessel, a dirge.\r\n\r\n  And now the doomed vessel is beating and crashing,\r\n    With violence on the dark, rough, rugged rocks;\r\n  And the tempest-tossed surge, while resistlessly dashing\r\n    Around her, each effort to save her but mocks.\r\n\r\n  The lightnings play luridly, fiercely above her,\r\n    Illuming with horror the wind-cloven waves!\r\n  Displaying the wreck, as their flashes discover,\r\n    The victims despairingly gaze on their graves.\r\n\r\n  For forked and furious, the fiery flung flashes,\r\n    Gleam o'er the sad wreck like a funeral pyre;\r\n  And louder and louder each thunder clap crashes.\r\n    The air in a roar! the billows on fire!\r\n\r\n  The heart-anguished cries o'er the pitiless waters,\r\n    Are borne on the blast of the thunder-rocked air,\r\n  As husbands and wives, as sons and as daughters,\r\n    Unite in a wild shrieking wail of despair.\r\n\r\n  But now from the moss covered fisherman's dwelling,\r\n    The _Life-Boat_ is manned by the chivalrous brave!\r\n  Though the wild howling storm of the tempest is swelling,\r\n    They'll peril their own lives, the wrecked ones to save.\r\n\r\n  And now to the merciless surges they launch her,\r\n    And back she is flung to the white-pebbled beach!\r\n  Now cleaves the wild surf, for never a stauncher,\r\n    Or braver crew mounted a deadlier breach.\r\n\r\n  Now swift o'er the waves madly bounding and dashing!\r\n    The nobly manned life-boat speeds on her lone way,\r\n  Now sinks she below, the waves o'er her splashing,\r\n    Now cleaves like arrow, the white foaming spray.\r\n\r\n  And now for a moment she's hid from our vision,\r\n    As darkness, and thick gloom enshroud her frail form;\r\n  A flash! and we see that the life-saving mission,\r\n    Still skims o'er the waves like a Bird of the Storm.\r\n\r\n  Hurrah! they have triumphed! the wrecked ones no longer\r\n    Resignedly list to the ocean's hoarse roar;\r\n  But now with strong arms, that bright Hope has made stronger,\r\n    They pull with a hearty good-will for the shore.\r\n\r\n  Hurrah! and Hurrah! on the whirlwind's commotion,\r\n    And the howl of the storm, uprose cheers from the land;\r\n  From hearts throbbing wildly with grateful emotion,\r\n    As safely she reaches the surf-beaten strand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Æronaut's Song.\r\n\r\n  Up! up! from the ground, for the chords that bound\r\n    Us to earth are rent in twain;\r\n  And our Aerial boat shall gracefully float,\r\n    Far, far, o'er the sea and main.\r\n\r\n  O'er the forest trees, on the rippling breeze,\r\n    We'll proudly soar away:\r\n  And higher and higher, will still aspire,\r\n    Toward realms of endless day.\r\n\r\n  To regions on high, like an arrow we fly,\r\n    Through limitless fields of air;\r\n  And away apace, through trackless space,\r\n    The giddiest flight we dare.\r\n\r\n  Earth's brilliance fades, and her everglades\r\n    Assumes a softer hue;\r\n  Her hills and dales, her lake gemmed vales\r\n    Are glorious to the view.\r\n\r\n  Meandering round enchanted ground,\r\n    Earth's crystal rivers seem;\r\n  So far below to brightly flow,\r\n    Like liquid silver's stream.\r\n\r\n  Her cloud capped hills o'er rocks and rills,\r\n    That proudly seem to stand,\r\n  Now fade like gleams in passing dreams\r\n    Of lovely fairy land.\r\n\r\n  Yet on we mount to the drainless fount,\r\n    Of wild tempestuous storms;\r\n  And our fairy shrouds now kiss the clouds;\r\n    In all their varied forms.\r\n\r\n  Proud man, who at birth was king of the earth,\r\n    Soon made himself lord of the sea;\r\n  And now we arise to empyrean skies,\r\n    For kings of the air are we.\r\n\r\n  Grim centuries old to the past have rolled,\r\n    Since the stars from chaos-woke;\r\n  Yet no earth-born sound hath this deep, profound\r\n    And solemn silence broke.\r\n\r\n  The highest note of the lark ne'er floats\r\n    To this region of sunless cloud;\r\n  Nor hath eagle bird the silence stir'd,\r\n    With his screaming, shrill and loud.\r\n\r\n  Yet our joyous song, as we sweep along\r\n    In pathless realms afloat,\r\n  Rings on the air and trembles there,\r\n    From out our fairy boat.\r\n\r\n  On eddying waves a thousand caves,\r\n    Where Aerial spirits throng,\r\n  Repeat each tone as though they'd known\r\n    Our unfamiliar song.\r\n\r\n  O'er billowy seas with fresh'ning breeze,\r\n    'Tis glorious oft to roam;\r\n  And joy to mark a graceful bark,\r\n    Divide the salt sea foam:\r\n\r\n  And joy to wake at morning break,\r\n    When huntsman's bugle sounds,\r\n  And gaily lead on fiery steed,\r\n    In chase of deer and hounds.\r\n\r\n  But moonlight sail with fresh'ning gale,\r\n    Or merry chase afar,\r\n  Can ne'er compare with flight through air,\r\n    In our Aerial Car.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1853, Mr. Gray, who was also then postmaster, offered him a\r\nposition in the Cleveland post-office, which he accepted, and entered upon\r\nits duties; but at the end of two months, being dissatisfied with the dull\r\nroutine and monotony of such an occupation, he threw up his position; and\r\nhaving, on the very day he left the post-office, decided to adopt the\r\nlegal profession, before night he had secured a position in the law office\r\nof Charles Stetson, Esq., then in large and active practice, and had\r\nentered upon the study of the law, where he continued for over a year and\r\na half, pursuing his studies with assiduity and success. He then entered\r\nthe law office of Hon. William Collins and pursued his studies with him\r\nuntil June, 1855, when he was admitted to the Bar by the District Court in\r\nDelaware, Delaware county, Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Very Truly, James M. Jones.]\r\n\r\nShortly after his admission to the Bar, he was retained as leading\r\ncounsel for the defence in the famous \"Townsend McHenry\" extradition case,\r\na proceeding pending before U. S. Commissioner Grannis, on the charge that\r\nthe prisoner, who claimed to be Robert McHenry, was no other than the\r\nnotorious William Townsend, a well known, desperate Canadian highway\r\nrobber and murderer; and in this Mr. Jones attracted attention by the\r\nskill with which he managed it. Indeed, it became necessary to send to\r\nCanada for several successive lots of witnesses, before they could make a\r\ncase. The prisoner was, however, taken to Canada and put upon his trial\r\nfor murder as William Townsend, the sole question on the trial being one\r\nof identity; and a more extraordinary trial in that respect cannot be\r\nfound in history. And although on the trial about one hundred witnesses\r\ntestified to his being the veritable William Townsend, he was,\r\nnevertheless, able to produce a still larger number of equally credible\r\nwitnesses to testify that they knew Townsend, and this was not the man,\r\nand also such an array of circumstances as satisfied the jury he was not\r\nthe man, and he was acquitted!\r\n\r\nMr. Jones was nominated by the Republican party of Cleveland as judge of\r\nthe City Court, in 1857, but in common with the entire ticket, was\r\ndefeated. He was an early adherent of the old Liberty party, and a warm\r\nadvocate on the stump and elsewhere, of the election of John C. Fremont to\r\nthe Presidency, and a firm supporter of Lincoln's administration.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed Attorney for the Western Union Telegraph Company, one of\r\nthe largest corporations in the United States, in the year 1865, and has\r\never since continued, as such attorney, to have charge and supervision of\r\na large and peculiar legal business for the company, extending over the\r\nvarious States and Territories embraced in what is known as the Central\r\nDivision of the territory covered by its lines. He has made telegraph law\r\na speciality for several years, and has probably had as large and extended\r\nexperience in that comparatively new and peculiar branch of the law as any\r\nother attorney in the country.\r\n\r\nHe was elected Prosecuting Attorney for the county of Cuyahoga, in the\r\nFall of 1867, and was distinguished during his term for the zeal,\r\nfidelity, and ability with which he discharged his officiai duties. It\r\nfell to his lot to prosecute many important and difficult criminal cases;\r\nprominent among them was the trial of Sarah M. Victor, for the murder, by\r\npoison, of her brother, William Parquette. The case was peculiar and\r\nremarkable; the murdered man had lain in his grave a whole year before\r\nsuspicions were aroused that his death was caused by foul play; slight\r\ncircumstances directed attention to suspicious appearances in the case,\r\nwhich a quiet investigation did not diminish. The prosecutor, therefore,\r\ncaused the body to be secretly disinterred, and engaged J. L. Cassells, an\r\naccomplished chemist, to subject the body to a chemical analysis, which on\r\nbeing done, arsenic in sufficient quantity to produce death was found in\r\nthe stomach and other internal organs. Her arrest for murder, therefore,\r\nimmediately took place. The circumstances of the case were well calculated\r\nto arouse an intense interest in the public mind as to the result of the\r\ntrial. The facts that the alleged poisoner was a woman, that the murdered\r\nman was her own brother, that her own sister was supposed to be an\r\nimportant witness against her, that the murder, if murder it was, was in\r\nthe highest degree cruel, mercenary, and devilish, that at the time of her\r\narrest she was prominently connected with religious and benevolent\r\ninstitutions of the city, though it was well known she had previously led\r\nan irregular life, and the profound secrecy in which the dark deed had\r\nslumbered for a whole year, all seemed to concur in riveting public\r\nattention upon it; and yet, previous to the trial, the belief was\r\nprevalent in the community generally, as well as among the members of the\r\nBar, that however guilty the prisoner might be, she would not be\r\nconvicted. In this belief the prosecutor did not share, but at once went\r\nto work with his accustomed energy to unravel the evidences of the great\r\ncrime; and for many weeks, with an energy that never flagged, himself and\r\nhis assistant, H. B. DeWolf, Esq., patiently and persistently explored the\r\ndark secrets of her life, examined hundreds of witnesses, and inextricably\r\nwound the coils of evidence around her.\r\n\r\nThe case, which was tried in the May term of the Court of Common Pleas,\r\n1868, lasted fourteen days, was fully reported phonographically, and made\r\nabout twenty-seven hundred pages of testimony, which was pronounced, when\r\nclosed on the part of the State, \"a marvelous net-work of circumstantial\r\nevidence.\"\r\n\r\nThe case was closed by Mr. Jones in an able and conclusive speech of six\r\nhours in length. The prisoner was convicted by the jury after but a\r\nbrief deliberation, and she was sentenced to be hanged, but her sentence\r\nwas afterward commuted to imprisonment for life. In numerous other\r\nimportant and warmly contested criminal cases Mr. Jones has been almost\r\nuniformly successful, displaying in them all, much tact, self-possession,\r\nand legal ability.\r\n\r\nMr. Jones was married at Chagrin Falls, Cuyahoga county, Ohio, February\r\n8th, 1860, by the Rev. Luther Lee, to Ermina W., daughter of Harmon and\r\nLeonora Barrows, of the latter place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEducational.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCitizens of Cleveland are justly proud of their Public Schools, and of the\r\nsystem of education under which they are conducted, but yet the history of\r\nthese schools, until within a few years, was one of struggle against\r\nparsimony and prejudice. It was only by persistent efforts on the part of\r\na few public-spirited citizens, who believed that money spent in educating\r\nthe masses is the best investment that can possibly be made, that the\r\nPublic School system of Cleveland has attained its present excellence, and\r\nthe miserable make-shift school buildings, in which the children of the\r\ncity were taught have given place to the large, convenient and elegant\r\nbuildings of the present.\r\n\r\nThe first public school of Cleveland, the \"Cleveland Free School,\" was\r\nestablished in March, 1830, \"for the education of male and female children\r\nof every religious denomination,\" and was supported by the city. It was\r\nheld for years in the basement of the Bethel church, which was then a\r\nframe building, measuring forty by thirty feet, situated at the corner of\r\nDiamond street and Superior Street hill. In 1837, the average number of\r\npupils in attendance was ninety males and forty-six females. There were\r\nalso the Young Ladies' Seminary, or the old \"Academy,\" on St. Clair\r\nstreet, presided over by Miss Harrison, and the Cleveland Female Seminary,\r\nin Farmer's Block, corner of Ontario and Prospect streets, incorporated\r\nApril, 1837, with Henry Sexton, Benjamin Rouse, H. H. Dodge, A. P. Smith,\r\nand A. Wheeler as trustees. At that date, Ohio City supported two district\r\nand one free school, but the attendance is not recorded.\r\n\r\nThe story of the growth of the school system of the State and of its local\r\ndevelopment in the city of Cleveland is mainly told in the biography of\r\nMr. Harvey Rice, on pages following this, and in the preceding pages which\r\nsketch the history of Mr. Charles Bradburn. All that is necessary to be\r\ngiven here, is a brief summary of some of the leading events in the\r\nhistory of the Cleveland Public Schools as prepared by one who took a\r\nleading part in their organization and development.\r\n\r\nThe Public Schools were organized under the city charter in 1837, and the\r\ncontrol vested in a board of five school managers, elected by the Council.\r\nThe chairman of the board was styled the acting manager, and was secretary\r\nand Superintendant of repairs and of discipline. This original arrangement\r\nwas succeeded in 1853, by a board of seven members, appointed by the\r\nCouncil. In 1854, when Cleveland and Ohio City were united, another change\r\noccurred. One member of the school board from each of the eleven Wards was\r\nchosen by the Council. In 1856, the number was reduced to five, and\r\nfinally, in 1859, by authority of a law of the State, the members of the\r\nBoard of Education, one from each Ward, were elected by the people, for\r\nthe term of one year, which was extended to two years in 1862, and so\r\nremains to the present time. The powers of the board were greatly enlarged\r\nby a law passed in the Spring of 1869.\r\n\r\nCharles Bradburn was the first acting manager, secretary and\r\nsuperintendent, assisted and encouraged by a few warm friends of\r\neducation, chief of whom, at this time, was Geo. Willey. In 1840, Mr.\r\nAndrew Freese was employed as principal teacher, and soon became actual\r\nsuperintendent, though not formally clothed with that authority until\r\nseveral years afterwards. In the meantime, school buildings were erected\r\non Prospect street, Rockwell street, West St. Clair street and Kentucky\r\nstreet, (West Side).\r\n\r\nFor several years the course of instruction was quite limited, and of low\r\ngrade. The school buildings, then supposed to be large and commodious,\r\nwere soon crowded with scholars very much mixed, as to standing, and\r\nmoving forward amid much confusion. In 1841, the second stories of the\r\nProspect street and Bockwell street buildings were converted into grammar\r\nschools of a higher grade. The West St. Clair street school was the first\r\none arranged for the improved grading of primary and secondary schools in\r\nseparate departments.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, the board directed Mr. Freese to exercise a general\r\nsuperintendence over the classification, instruction and discipline in all\r\nthe grammar and subordinate schools, but no superintendent was authorized\r\nby law, until 1853. It was full time that some authority should be\r\nintroduced to correct the abuses which had insensibly and unavoidably\r\ncrept into the discipline and course of instruction, and vigorous\r\nenforcement of strict rules brought out a fierce opposition from anxious,\r\nbut ill-informed and partial parents, who felt provoked and discouraged by\r\nthe discovery that their children were in classes far ahead of their\r\nactual qualifications and must be put back to be more thoroughly drilled\r\nin preparatory studies. Gradually confusion gave place to order, scholars\r\nwere ranked as near as could be according to their actual standing; the\r\ngrades arranged as Primary, Secondary, Intermediate and Grammar\r\ndepartments, the entire course consummated in the East and West High\r\nSchools. But all this was the work of immense labor, extending through\r\nyears of ceaseless effort and expense, little anticipated by the people,\r\nor perhaps by the hopeful projectors of the system, when they so manfully\r\nentered upon the undertaking. Twenty-six years ago the entire corps of\r\nteachers numbered only fifteen. In 1848, they had increased to twenty. In\r\nthat year, children under six years of age were excluded, to the great\r\ndisgust of many fond mothers who thought the public school the very best\r\nplace to keep the troublesome young ones out of their way.\r\n\r\nUnder the general school law a portion of the taxes collected was set\r\napart for the support of the schools, while a special fund for school\r\nbuildings was raised, from time to time, by direct taxation, or by\r\nloan, and buildings erected in the different Wards as the city\r\nincreased in extent.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, the East High School was opened in the basement of the old\r\nUniversalist Church (now the Plymouth Church) on Prospect street, near\r\nErie street. A strong opposition was made to this advanced step. It was\r\nobjected to as illegal, which it actually was, though that was soon\r\nremedied; and as unnecessary and unreasonable.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that many of those strenuous opponents are\r\nnow among the warm friends of the High Schools, and justly proud of\r\ntheir success.\r\n\r\nRichard Fry, then Principal of the West St Clair school, distinguished\r\nhimself by his writings through the press, and his speeches at public\r\nmeetings, in advocating the claims of the High School, and thus powerfully\r\nsustained its friends in their unpopular contest. The law authorizing a\r\nHigh School limited the whole course to two years, and required one year's\r\nprevious attendance at one of the grammar schools.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, a regular course of instruction was adopted, extending to three\r\nyears, but still confined to English studies. In 1856, the Latin and\r\nGreek languages were introduced, and in 1859, the German was added to\r\nthe full course. These ancient and foreign languages were optional with\r\nthe students, as well as the French language, which was introduced some\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nThe first graduated class consisted of ten scholars, eight of whom\r\nafterwards became teachers. Indeed, it soon became evident that the High\r\nSchool was not only the best, but almost the only reliable source of\r\nsupplying teachers for the subordinate schools, which were fast\r\nincreasing. The extreme difficulty of procuring competent and reliable\r\nteachers had, all along, been one of the greatest embarrassments in\r\ncarrying forward a course of instruction, extensive, thorough, and\r\nheretofore almost unknown west of the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe original design of one central High School was found to be unsuited to\r\nthe extended territory on both sides of the river, and two High Schools\r\nwere substituted.\r\n\r\nThe East High School building was completed and opened in 1856. The West\r\nHigh School was first opened in the Kentucky street building, and\r\ncontinued there for several years, until in 1861, the new building was\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, Mr. Freese was relieved from the superintendency which had become\r\ntoo laborious for his declining health, and L. M. Oviatt took the\r\nmanagement for two years, when he was succeeded by Anson Smyth, formerly\r\nState Superintendent. On his resignation, Mr. Andrew J. Rickoff, of\r\nCincinnati, was called to the position. Under his management important\r\nchanges in the classification and management of the schools have been\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe prominence given to Messrs Bradburn, Willey and Freese, in the history\r\nof the public schools, is not intended to disparage or undervalue the\r\nservices rendered by many others, without whose hearty and efficient\r\nco-operation the whole undertaking would have failed. Prominent among these\r\ncooperators were J. D. Cleveland, J. Fitch, Dr. Maynard, Harvey Rice, Bev.\r\nJ. A. Thome, T. P. Handy, W. D. Beattie, (since deceased,) R. B. Dennis,\r\nAnsel Roberts, L. M. Oviatt, and Thos. Jones, Jr.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, there were eighteen male, and one hundred and thirty-nine female\r\nteachers employed in the public schools of the city, making an aggregate\r\nof one hundred and fifty seven. The total number of pupils enrolled was\r\n10,154. The average number belonging to the schools, 7060, and the average\r\ndaily attendance, 6623.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, Harvey Rice]\r\n\r\n\r\nHarvey Rice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Ohio Educational Monthly for April, 1860, appeared a pretty full\r\nbiography of Hon. Harvey Rice, who has filled an important position in\r\nconnection with the educational interests of Ohio. From that account we\r\nlearn that Mr. Rice is a native of Massachusetts. He was born June 11th,\r\n1800. In 1824, he graduated from Williams College, and the same year\r\nremoved to Cleveland. He came to Ohio a stranger and without influential\r\nfriends here or elsewhere to aid his efforts for advancement. When he\r\nlanded at Cleveland he owned nothing but the clothes he wore, and three\r\ndollars in his pocket. At that time Cleveland contained but 400\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nMaking no disclosure as to the low state of his treasury and the rather\r\ndull prospect for an immediate replenishing of the same, he took lodgings\r\nat the best public house the town afforded, at the rate of two dollars and\r\na half per week. At the expiration of one week he paid his board bill and\r\nremoved to a private boarding-house, with but fifty cents left, and\r\ncommenced teaching a classical school in the old academy on St. Clair\r\nstreet. About the same time he commenced the study of the law under the\r\ndirection of Reuben Wood, then a prominent member of the Cleveland Bar,\r\nand at the expiration of two years was admitted to practice, and entered\r\ninto copartnership with his former instructor, which continued until Mr.\r\nWood was elected to the Bench.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, he was elected Justice of the Peace, and in 1830, elected to\r\nrepresent his district in the State Legislature. Soon after, without\r\nsolicitation on his part, he was appointed an agent for the sale of the\r\nWestern Reserve school lands, a tract of fifty-six thousand acres,\r\nsituated in the Virginia Military District. He opened a land office at\r\nMillersburgh, in Holmes county, for the sales, and in the course of three\r\nyears sold all the lands, and paid the avails, nearly one hundred and\r\nfifty thousand dollars, into the State Treasury, as a school fund for the\r\nexclusive benefit of educating the children of the Western Reserve, the\r\ninterest of which is now annually paid by the State for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, Mr. Rice returned to Cleveland, and was appointed Clerk of the\r\nCommon Pleas and Supreme Courts, an office in which he faithfully served\r\nfor seven years, and in 1834 and 1836, was nominated by the Democratic\r\nConvention as a candidate for Congress, and received the united support of\r\nthe party, though without expectation of success, as the Democrats were\r\nlargely in the minority. He was the first Democrat ever sent to the\r\nLegislature from Cuyahoga county, and, while serving in that body, was\r\nconsidered one of its ablest and most influential members. He was\r\nappointed by the House one of the select committee for revising the\r\nstatutes of the State, and while in that capacity, introduced and\r\nadvocated with acknowledged ability many new provisions, which still\r\nretain their place upon our statute book.\r\n\r\nThe natural abilities of Mr. Rice are of a very high order. His mind is\r\nthoroughly disciplined and cultivated, and for the comparatively short\r\ntime he practiced at the Bar, he obtained an enviable reputation for legal\r\nability, sound, practical, discriminating judgment and gentlemanly\r\ndeportment.\r\n\r\nHe is well known as an able contributor to many of the best periodicals of\r\nthe day, and is a graceful and exceedingly vigorous writer. His\r\nimagination is rich and glowing, and his mind well stored by a long and\r\njudicious course of mental training. We have seen some articles of Mr.\r\nRice's which compare favorably with those of the best writers of the day.\r\n\r\nThe following, which we find in the \"Nineteenth Century,\" we take the\r\nliberty of publishing here, and look upon it as a meritorious and\r\nbeautiful poem:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Moral Hero.\r\n\r\n  With heart that trusteth still,\r\n    Set high your mark;\r\n  And though with human ill\r\n    The warfare may be dark,\r\n  Resolve to conquer, and you will!\r\n\r\n  Resolve, then onward press,\r\n    Fearless and true:\r\n  Believe it--Heaven will bless\r\n    The brave--and still renew\r\n  Your hope and courage in distress.\r\n\r\n  Press on, nor stay to ask\r\n    For friendship's aid;\r\n  Deign not to wear a mask\r\n    Nor wield a coward's blade,\r\n  But still persist, though hard the task.\r\n\r\n  Rest not--inglorious rest\r\n    Unnerves the man;\r\n  Struggle--'tis God's behest!\r\n    Fill up life's little span\r\n  With God-like deeds--it is the test--\r\n\r\n  Test of the high-born soul,\r\n    And lofty aim;\r\n  The test in History's scroll\r\n    Of every honored name--None\r\n  but the brave shall win the goal'\r\n\r\n  Go act the hero's part,\r\n    And in the strife,\r\n  Strike with the hero's heart\r\n    For liberty and life--\r\n  Ay, strike for Truth; preserve her chart'\r\n\r\n  Her chart unstain'd preserve,\r\n    'Twill guide you right.\r\n  Press on and never swerve,\r\n    But keep your armer bright,\r\n  And struggle still with firmer nerve.\r\n\r\n  What though the tempest rage,\r\n    Buffet the sea!\r\n  Where duty calls, engage:\r\n    And ever striving be\r\n  The moral hero of the Age!\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1851, Mr. Rice was put in nomination for the State Senate,\r\nand was elected by a majority exceeding seven hundred votes.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly to which he was now returned, was the first that\r\nconvened under the new Constitution. Upon this body devolved the\r\nresponsibility of reconstructing the statutes of the State, and adapting\r\nthem to the requisition of the Constitution, so as to secure to the people\r\nthe practical benefits of the great reforms which had been achieved by its\r\nadoption. Mr. Rice contributed quite as much as any other member to the\r\nimportant legislation of the two sessions held by that General Assembly.\r\nIt was said of him that he _was always at his post_. The degree of\r\ninfluence which he exercised as a legislator, was such as few have the\r\ngood fortune to wield.\r\n\r\nAmong the variety of measures which engaged his attention, he took a\r\nprominent part in procuring the passage of the act which authorized the\r\nestablishment of two additional lunatic asylums in the State.\r\n\r\nHis course in relation to the subject of common schools attracted public\r\nattention throughout the State, and called forth from the press\r\ncommendations of a very complimentary character. The correspondent of a\r\npaper published at Newark, writing from Columbus, remarks as follows:\r\n\r\n  Senator Rice, of Cuyahoga, has in charge a bill for the reorganization\r\n  of schools and providing for their supervision.\r\n\r\n  No better man than Mr. Rice could have been selected for this work. He\r\n  is a model man and a model Senator. Clear headed, sound minded,\r\n  carefully and fully educated, with a painstaking disposition, he is the\r\n  ablest chairman of the standing committee on schools that any Ohio\r\n  Legislature ever had. Deeply impressed with the great importance of the\r\n  subject--of the stern necessity which exists for basing our whole\r\n  republican form of government on the intelligence of the people, he has\r\n  carefully provided a bill, which, if enacted into a law, will give a\r\n  good _common_ school education to every child in the State, and in so\r\n  doing, has been equally careful that the money raised for that purpose\r\n  be not squandered. The bill provides for a State Commissioner of Common\r\n  Schools, and it has been mentioned to me as a matter of deep regret,\r\n  that the Constitution excludes Mr. Rice from being a candidate for that\r\n  office--no member of the Legislature being eligible to an office created\r\n  while he was a member, until one year after the expiration of his term\r\n  of office.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the final passage of the bill, Mr. Rice addressed the\r\nSenate in a concluding speech, which was published, and very generally\r\nnoticed by the press. Among these notices, a leading paper published at\r\nCleveland, with a magnanimity rarely possessed by a political opponent,\r\nmakes the following comments and quotations:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rice made the closing speech on the School Bill, in the Senate, on\r\n  the 24th. It was his Bill. He had labored over it, and for it, a long\r\n  time, and given to it every consideration, and gained for it every\r\n  counsel, which, by any possibility, he could gain.\r\n\r\n  The text of his speech was the language of the Constitution itself; the\r\n  duty of securing 'a thorough and efficient system of common schools\r\n  throughout the State.'\r\n\r\n  Mr. Rice goes into detail on the school bill, and, regretting that we\r\n  have not room for the detail, we close our synopsis of his very sensible\r\n  speech by quoting its conclusion:\r\n\r\n  \"It is certainly much cheaper, as well as much wiser, to _educate_ than\r\n  to _punish_. How much of crime would be prevented if a higher order of\r\n  education were generally diffused among all classes. A well educated and\r\n  enlightened people will have but little occasion for criminal courts,\r\n  jails and penitentiaries. The educated man has ordinarily too much\r\n  self-respect, too much regard for moral principle and the value of a\r\n  good character to stoop to crime. In short, sir, the perpetuity of the\r\n  government, and security of the citizen, and of property, depend upon\r\n  the virtue and intelligence of the people.\r\n\r\n  \"By the provisions of this bill, it is intended to make our common\r\n  schools what they ought to be--the colleges of the people--'cheap enough\r\n  for the poorest, and good enough for the richest.' With but a slight\r\n  increase of taxation, schools of different grades can be established and\r\n  maintained in every township of the State, and the sons and daughters of\r\n  our farmers and mechanics have an opportunity of acquiring a finished\r\n  education, equally with the more favored of the land. And, in this way,\r\n  the elements of mind now slumbering among the uneducated masses, like\r\n  the fine unwrought marble in the quarry, will be aroused and brought out\r\n  to challenge the admiration of the world-Philosophers and sages will\r\n  abound everywhere, on the farm and in the workshop. And many a man of\r\n  genius will stand out from among the masses, and exhibit a brilliancy of\r\n  intellect, which will be recognized in the circling years of the great\r\n  future, as\r\n\r\n    'A light, a landmark on the cliffs of time.'\r\n\r\n  \"It is only the educated man who is competent to interrogate nature, and\r\n  comprehend her revelations. Though I would not break down the\r\n  aristocracy of knowledge of the present age, yet, sir, I would level up,\r\n  and equalize, and thus create, if I may be allowed the expression, a\r\n  democracy of knowledge. In this way, and in this way only, can men be\r\n  made equal in fact--equal in their social and political relations--equal\r\n  in mental refinement, and in a just appreciation of what constitutes man\r\n  the brother of his fellow man.\r\n\r\n  \"In conclusion, sir, allow me to express my belief, that the day is not\r\n  far distant when Ohio, in the noble cause of popular education and of\r\n  human rights, will 'lead the column,' and become, what she is capable of\r\n  becoming--a star of the first magnitude--the brightest in the galaxy of\r\n  our American Union.\"\r\n\r\n  A proud hour now came for Mr. Rice! A good and glorious one for the\r\n  State! The roll of the Senate was called, and that body, on the 24th day\r\n  of January, 1853, proceeded to cast its final vote upon the bill, when\r\n  only two negatives were announced.\r\n\r\nAnother bill, of scarcely less importance than the school bill, was\r\nintroduced into the Senate by Mr. Rice, near the heel of the adjourned\r\nsession, which with him was a favorite measure, and which seemed to meet\r\nwith the hearty approbation of the public. It had for its object the\r\nestablishment of a \"State Reform School,\" expressly designed for juvenile\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\nBut owing to the late day of the session in which the bill was introduced,\r\nthough very favorably received by the senate, a motion was made to\r\npostpone it until the next session. In reference to this motion, without\r\nattempting to make a formal speech, Mr. Rice explained briefly the object\r\ncontemplated by the bill. His remarks relating as they did to a subject of\r\npublic interest, were reported and published. The bill, at a subsequent\r\nsession, resulted in establishing the present Reform Farm School.\r\n\r\nThe eminent services which he has rendered the State in the promotion of\r\nher educational interests will be long and gratefully remembered by those\r\nof his fellow citizens who properly appreciate the true objects of life,\r\nand who wish to secure to themselves, to their children, and to the\r\ngenerations which will follow them, the social blessings which flow from a\r\nhigh degree of refinement, intelligence and moral virtue.\r\n\r\nWhile a member of the City Council, in 1857, Mr. Rice took the lead in\r\nestablishing the Cleveland Industrial School, and was chairman of the\r\ncommittee that put it into successful operation. It has now grown to be\r\none of the most important charitable institutions in Cleveland. Mr. Rice\r\nis still active in extending its usefulness.\r\n\r\nIn the same year he originated the project, and introduced the resolution\r\ninto the Council, authorizing the erection of the Perry Monument which now\r\ngraces the Public Park of the city. The cost of the Monument, by the terms\r\nof the resolution, was made to depend on the voluntary subscriptions of\r\nthe citizens. Mr. Rice was appointed Chairman of the Monument Committee,\r\nand after three years of persevering effort, succeeded in carrying the\r\nobject of the resolution into effect. The Monument was inaugurated with\r\nimposing ceremonies, on the 10th of September, 1860, the anniversary of\r\nPerry's victory on Lake Erie. Mr. Bancroft, the historian, delivered the\r\nInaugural Address. As carefully estimated, not less than one hundred\r\nthousand people attended the inauguration. In carrying out the programme\r\nthe battle of Lake Erie was reproduced, in a mock fight, on the Lake in\r\nfront of the city. It was a proud day for Cleveland. Both the Monument and\r\nthe inauguration were pronounced a perfect success.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, Mr. Rice, being elected to the Board of Education, was appointed\r\nPresident of the Board, and during his term of office rendered essential\r\nservice in promoting the educational interests of the city. In fact, he\r\nhas always been a zealous friend and advocate of popular education. In his\r\nliterary career he has become widely known as the author of \"Mount Vernon,\r\nand Other Poems\"--a volume containing two hundred and fifty pages which\r\nhas reached a fifth edition.\r\n\r\nIn 1862, Mr. Rice was appointed by the Governor of the State, with the\r\nconcurrence of the War Department, a commissioner for Cuyahoga county, to\r\nconduct the first draft made in the county during the late civil war. In\r\nexecuting this delicate task he acquitted himself with firmness,\r\nintegrity, and discretion. While in the discharge of his duties he found\r\nhis office one morning suddenly besieged by some five or six hundred\r\nexcited citizens, who were armed with pistols and other weapons,\r\nthreatening to demolish the office and destroy the records. They had been\r\ninstigated to make this demonstration by false rumors regarding the\r\nfairness of the draft. Mr. Rice met the crisis firmly, sent to the\r\nmilitary camp on the Heights for a detachment of soldiers, infantry and\r\nartillery, who came to his relief on the \"double quick,\" and dispersed the\r\nriotous assemblage. To satisfy the disaffected that all was right and just\r\nin relation to the draft, Mr. Rice proposed that they should appoint a\r\ncommittee of their own to investigate the state of affairs in the draft\r\noffice. They did so, and with his aid an elaborate examination was made,\r\nand the committee reported that the draft had been conducted fairly and\r\njustly in all respects. Mr. Rice then proceeded with the draft, and as\r\nluck would have it, two of the committee, who had been ring-leaders in\r\ngetting up the demonstration, were drafted on the spot, and every body\r\nseemed pleased with the result.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, Mr. Rice, wishing to express his regard for the cause of\r\nMissions, as well as for the college where he graduated, erected at his\r\nown expense, and with the approval of the college authorities, a beautiful\r\nmarble monument in Mission Park, at Williamstown, Mass., commemorative of\r\nthe origin of American Foreign Missions. The park is a part of the college\r\ndomains, and within it there is a maple grove where a few pious young\r\nstudents of the college, in the summer of 1806, held occasional\r\nprayer-meetings. At one of these meetings a shower of rain compelled them\r\nto seek the shelter of a neighboring haystack, where they continued their\r\nexercises, and where one of their number, Samuel J. Mills, first suggested\r\nthe idea of a mission to foreign heathen lands, as being a religions duty.\r\nIn this noble and philanthropic thought his associates all concurred, and\r\nthere, while at the haystack, consecrated themselves in solemn prayer, to\r\nthe great work. From this circumstance originated American Foreign\r\nMissions. The monument was planned by Mr. Rice It is erected on the spot\r\nwhere the haystack stood, is twelve feet in height, and surmounted with a\r\nmarble globe three feet in diameter, and cut in map lines. The face of the\r\nmonument has the inscription, \"The Field is the World,\" followed with a\r\nhaystack, sculptured in bas relief, and the names of the five young men,\r\nwho held the prayer-meeting, and the date 1806. The monument was dedicated\r\nJuly 28th, 1867, at the maple grove, in the park. A large audience was\r\npresent. Mr. Rice, by special request, delivered the dedicatory address,\r\nwhich was received with a high degree of satisfaction, and afterwards\r\npublished, with the other proceedings, in pamphlet form.\r\n\r\nMr. Rice has accumulated a reasonable share of \"this world's goods;\" has\r\nbeen twice married--first in 1828, and afterwards in 1840.\r\n\r\nHe has a wife, three sons and three daughters still living, and now\r\nleads, comparatively, a retired, yet not an idle life.\r\n\r\nHe still has the appearance of a well preserved gentleman, he is six\r\nfeet in height, erect and of good proportions, and his general personal\r\nappearance is pleasing. In manner he is a true gentleman,--modest and\r\nkind, but prompt and decided. Two of his sons, Capt. Percy W. Rice and\r\nJames S. Rice, are settled in business at Cleveland. The youngest son,\r\nHarvey Rice, Jr., resides in California. The three daughters are\r\nmarried and settled--one in California and the other two in Cleveland.\r\nMrs. Rice is a lady of refinement, exemplary, and much beloved and\r\nrespected. As a family, but few have been more highly favored, or lived\r\nin more perfect harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Freese\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Andrew Freese will always hold a place of honor in the\r\nscholastic records of Cleveland. No educator in the city is held in such\r\naffectionate esteem by a large class of former pupils, and none better\r\ndeserves the grateful tributes paid to his abilities as a teacher and his\r\nworth as a citizen.\r\n\r\nMr. Freese was born in Levant, Penobscot county, Maine, on November 1st,\r\n1816. His father was a farmer, but Andrew was of such slender frame and\r\nweak constitution that he was completely unfitted for farming life. His\r\nfather destined him to be a printer, and took him to the nearest printing\r\noffice to show him how types were set and newspapers printed. The boy was\r\nnot favorably impressed with what he saw, and begged to be allowed to\r\nenter college. This was considered out of the question, his father being\r\ntoo poor to provide the necessary funds. But the boy's heart was set upon\r\nit, and he thought that by teaching school for a time he could obtain\r\nmoney enough to complete his own education. This idea he carried into\r\nexecution, and had no sooner entered on the business of teaching than he\r\nrealized that he had found his true vocation. He continued to teach and\r\nstudy until his collegiate course was completed, and then he resolved to\r\nfit himself for the business of teaching by studying the best systems of\r\neducation, as laid down in the most approved books and practiced in the\r\nmost successful schools. He examined the best school buildings, and\r\nbrought away plans of construction, and models of their furniture. The\r\nmost thorough teachers were consulted as to the results of their\r\nexperience, and when he had thus acquired a thorough mastery of the whole\r\nscience of teaching, instead of setting out as an educational empiric, he\r\nresolved to seek the West as a better field for turning his knowledge to\r\naccount, than was the East, where educators were far too numerous to make\r\nthe business profitable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, Andrew Freese]\r\n\r\nMr. Freese came to Cleveland in 1840, and offered his services to the\r\nBoard of School Managers as a teacher. His rare ability was appreciated,\r\nhe was immediately engaged, and was at once recognized as the head of the\r\nschools. There was then only the general school law to work under. The law\r\nas then understood, made it almost a crime to give instruction in the\r\nhigher branches of even an English education. There was then no high\r\nschools, or graded schools in the great State of Ohio. To Cleveland, and\r\nto Mr. Freese, belong the honor of establishing the first free high school\r\nin the State. The scholars from that school may now be found in almost\r\nevery State in the Union, eminent in all departments of life. They have\r\nbeen met with as Governors, jurists, mechanicians, and artists, and the\r\nfirst inquiry from them _all_ has been, \"Is Mr. Freese still with you? All\r\nI am, and all I have, I owe to him; may God forever bless him.\"\r\n\r\nThe high school was established in July, 1846, and Mr. Freese at once\r\nplaced at its head. Those unfriendly to public schools, and especially to\r\nthis department, offered him large inducements to engage in a private\r\nschool, but Mr. Freese had faith in the success of the experiment, and was\r\ndetermined not to abandon it until its success was insured. The pay given\r\nby the city was but a beggarly pittance, and his labors inside and out of\r\nthe school room were exceedingly arduous, but no discouragement could\r\ndaunt his zeal, and he resisted blandishments as he treated opposition,\r\nwith indifference. The unexpected and severe labors imposed upon him\r\nshattered his health, but with him love overcame all other considerations,\r\nand he persisted. In June, 1853, the office of Superintendent of\r\nInstruction was created, and tendered to Mr. Freese, who held it until\r\n1861, when his failing health admonished him to retire. Recently he was\r\nsummoned from his retirement to take the position of principal of the\r\nCentral High school, now grown to proportions its founders scarcely dared\r\nhope for it. It was with extreme reluctance that Mr. Freese consented to\r\nresume his old profession, but he finally did so, working with great zeal\r\nand success until the close of the Summer term of 1869, when, immediately\r\nafter re-election by a highly complimentary vote, he was compelled, by the\r\ncondition of his health, to resign his position and bid a final farewell\r\nto the profession he so much loved. The proceedings of the Board of\r\nEducation in relation to the resignation of Mr. Freese are of interest, as\r\nshowing the high value set upon his services to the cause of education.\r\n\r\nThe following communication was presented to the Board:\r\n\r\n  To the Honorable the Board of Education of the city of Cleveland:\r\n\r\n  Gentlemen: I have to submit herewith the resignation of Mr. Andrew\r\n  Freese, who has for the past year acted as principal of the Central\r\n  High school.\r\n\r\n  On account of ill health it was with great reluctance that Mr. Freese\r\n  went into this position. In accordance, however, with the advice of\r\n  friends, he finally yielded to persuasion and entered upon the discharge\r\n  of its duties with the well known earnestness of his character. The\r\n  result has been marked in the earnestness with which his able corps of\r\n  assistants associated with him have co-operated to promote the highest\r\n  interests of the school, and of each and all its pupils. It has been\r\n  specially marked, too, by the increased devotion of all the scholars to\r\n  their studies, and the ready acquiescence with which they have obeyed\r\n  all the rules and regulations of your Board.\r\n\r\n  In taking leave of Mr. Freese it is due to him that I should thus\r\n  formally and earnestly record my high appreciation of his services.\r\n  Furthermore, it may not be inappropriate for me testify to the fact,\r\n  that much of the hearty earnestness of the corps of teachers with which\r\n  I am now laboring, is due to the influence of this gentleman when he\r\n  held the office which I now hold.\r\n\r\n  Andrew J. Rickoff,\r\n  Superintendent of Instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Board of Education having received and accepted the resignation of\r\n  Andrew Freese, Esq., principal of the Central High School, Mr. Perkins\r\n  offered the following resolutions, which were adopted:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the thanks of the Board are hereby tendered to Mr.\r\n  Freese, for the valuable services he has rendered in the various\r\n  relations he has sustained to the public schools of this city during the\r\n  last quarter of a century. In every position he has been called to fill,\r\n  he has proved himself faithful to the trust committed to his keeping. To\r\n  him more than any other are we indebted for the deservedly elevated\r\n  character of our System of graded schools.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the president and secretary of the Board be requested\r\n  to communicate to Mr. Freese the feeling of regret occasioned by his\r\n  withdrawal from our service, together with a certified copy of its\r\n  action this evening.\r\n\r\nMr. Freese was the originator of the celebrated outline maps. Many years\r\nbefore any were published by Mitchell, they were in use here, and may\r\nstill be found on some of the walls and floors of our old school houses,\r\nwhere they were placed by Mr. Freese. What Horace Mann and William Colburn\r\ndid for the schools of New England, Andrew Freese has done for the schools\r\nof the West. Almost immediately after commencing his labors he began to\r\nprotest to the Board of School Managers against our school laws; under\r\nthem he could do no justice to himself or his scholars. His efforts were\r\naided by the Board of School Managers, and after a hard contest with city\r\nand State authorities, the laws were altered so as to give us one of the\r\nbest school systems in the world. The first free high school in the State\r\nwas started by Mr. Freese, in the basement of an old church, at a rent of\r\nfifty dollars per annum, and this was regarded by some of our largest tax\r\npayers as so great an outrage that they threatened to resist the payment\r\nof their taxes. The school now enjoys the use of a palatial building, and\r\nour grammar schools have the use of the most elegant and convenient\r\nstructures for educational purposes in the State. Many of our citizens\r\ndevoted their time and money to bring about this great change, which has\r\ndone and is doing so much for the welfare of our city. But perhaps no one\r\nman has done so much as Mr. Freese.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult, if not impossible, to overrate the services of Mr.\r\nFreese to the cause of education in Cleveland. It was the sole business of\r\nhis life, and he entered on it with utter unselfishness. With him the\r\ncause was everything, self nothing. He traveled far, spent his own slender\r\nfunds freely, and labored assiduously in the endeavor to secure the best\r\nof everything in plan and machinery, for the city schools. He had no\r\nambition outside or beyond the school room, and his shrinking modesty\r\nprevented him claiming the credit justly due him for the unintermitted and\r\nsuccessful labors performed within the school walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnson Smyth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the citizens of Ohio, few are more worthy of mention than Rev. Anson\r\nSmyth. There is not a township in the State in which his influence has not\r\nbeen felt, nor a school district in which his name is not honored. He has\r\nlabored to uplift the intellectual, social, and moral status of our great\r\ncommonwealth, and his impress is left on the highest and most sacred\r\ninterests of the people.\r\n\r\nThough born in Pennsylvania, Mr. Smyth is none the less a New Englander.\r\nHis parents and older brothers and sisters were natives of New England.\r\nThere many of his early years were spent, and there he received both his\r\ncollegiate and his theological education. There for two years he taught\r\nschool, and for three, was pastor of a church. Thus it is seen, that\r\nwhile his birth makes him a Pennsylvanian, his blood and education make\r\nhim a Yankee.\r\n\r\nMr. Smyth is a self-made man. By his unaided energies he surmounted the\r\ndifficulties that stood in the way of his advancement, and has achieved\r\ndistinction by a career of great usefulness. His father was a man of high\r\nrespectability, and most excellent character. He was a farmer in moderate\r\ncircumstances, and being well advanced in life, and declining in health,\r\nwhen his youngest son, the tenth of twelve children, determined to acquire\r\na liberal education, he was unable to do anything for his assistance. But\r\nthe boy had a brave heart, and he went forward, strong in the idea that\r\n\"there is nothing impossible to him that wills.\" At first by manual labor,\r\nand afterwards by teaching, he contrived to secure funds for meeting those\r\nexpenses which demanded ready payment. When he left the theological\r\nseminary he owed several hundred dollars, all of which he paid from his\r\nfirst earnings.\r\n\r\nAfter preaching for three years at the East, Mr. Smyth accepted a call to\r\nthe pastoral charge of a church in Michigan. It was a village of a few\r\nhundred people, in a new and wild region. Society was in a chaotic\r\ncondition, and there were but few who had either the ability or the\r\ndisposition to do much for the young pastor's support or encouragement.\r\nThe locality was unhealthy, and Mr. Smyth suffered severely from prevalent\r\ndiseases. But during a ministry there of four years, he was eminently\r\nsuccessful, and he left the church four times as strong as he found it.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Mr. Smyth came to Ohio, and, after spending a few months in\r\nCleveland, received and accepted a call to the pastorate of the\r\nPresbyterian church in Toledo. He entered upon his new charge with zeal\r\nand energy. He labored faithfully for the advancement of the cause of\r\nChrist in that rising town, but owing to chronic alienation among the\r\nmembers of his church, from the beginning he felt the need of that degree\r\nof co-operation and sympathy necessary to insure the full benefit of his\r\nlabors. Still, the condition of affairs greatly improved under his\r\nministry; the membership of the church being nearly doubled, and the\r\ncongregation largely increased. At the end of three years he resigned his\r\ncharge and entered upon that department of public service in which he has\r\nacquired most honorable distinction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly, Anson Smyth]\r\n\r\nUntil 1850, the facilities for education in Toledo were all in the future.\r\nWhile pastor of the church there, Mr. Smyth felt keenly the need of\r\nestablishing a good system of schools ere the town should become confirmed\r\nin the habit of neglecting so important an interest. A few of the citizens\r\ntook hold of the business with energy; the \"Akron School Law\" was adopted,\r\nand a Board of Education elected. Mr. Smyth was placed at the head of the\r\nmovement. This was a position he had never expected to fill, but,\r\nregarding it as a field of usefulness, a field in which to serve God and\r\nsociety, not less sacred than that of the pastoral office, he went to his\r\nnew work without a doubt that thereby he was doing the will of God. In\r\nmany particulars the business Mr. Smyth found upon his hands was new and\r\nstrange to him. He had had no experience in organizing schools upon the\r\ngraded plan. Eighteen years ago there were very few good schools in Ohio.\r\nLorin Andrews, at Massillon, Dr. Lord, at Columbus, M. F. Cowdery, at\r\nSandusky, Andrew Freese, at Cleveland, and H. H. Barney, at Cincinnati,\r\nwere the leaders in the educational reformation, then rising into notice.\r\nNot till three years afterwards was our noble school law enacted. But Mr.\r\nSmyth took hold of the great work entrusted to him with characteristic\r\nenergy. He read much and thought more upon the best plan of organizing a\r\nschool system for the city, and when he left there, in 1856, the schools\r\nof Toledo had gained a most enviable character. They were regarded as\r\namong the best in the country, and their Superintendent had acquired the\r\nreputation of being one of the wisest and most successful educators in\r\nAmerica. The Board of Education committed the entire management of the\r\nschools to him. The selection of teachers, the classification and\r\ndiscipline of the schools, the course of study, and the examinations were\r\njust what Mr. Smyth was pleased to make them. He gathered around him a\r\ncorps of teachers equal to the best in the State, and the schools were the\r\npride of the citizens. When he resigned, in closing an article upon the\r\nsubject, the Blade remarked: \"_We regard the retirement of Mr. Smyth as no\r\nless than a public calamity_.\"\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the State Teachers Association, in December, 1855, Mr.\r\nSmyth was unanimously elected President of that body, also editor of the\r\nJournal of Education. In the following February he removed to Columbus,\r\nand entered upon his editorial duties. His success in his new field was\r\nmost satisfactory to all who were interested in the cause which he\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1856, the Republican State Convention nominated Mr. Smyth for the\r\noffice of State Commissioner of Schools. This was an honor as unexpected\r\nby him as it was satisfactory to the people. He was elected by a large\r\nmajority, and in February, 1857, entered upon the discharge of the duties\r\nof his new office. In this high position he remained six years, having\r\nbeen re-elected in 1859.\r\n\r\nMr. Smyth was not disheartened when he found his post at the head of the\r\neducational forces of the State, environed with most serious\r\nembarrassments. The general school law had been in operation three years,\r\nencountering the hostility of a large portion of the people, who were\r\npersistent in their efforts to secure its repeal, or extensive\r\nmodification. It was regarded as doubtful whether it could much longer\r\nsurvive in the face of the antagonism which confronted it. But when Mr.\r\nSmyth turned the office over to his successor, in 1863, the law had become\r\npopular, and strong in the regards of nearly all the people. The changes\r\nwhich it had experienced were improvements, and it was everywhere working\r\nout its own praise.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch, Mr. Smyth's labors and successes in the Commissionership\r\ncan not be detailed. He spared no pains in promoting the interests which\r\nthe State had confided to him. Whether looking after members of the\r\nlegislature who were working against the law, or performing ordinary\r\noffice duties, or traveling and addressing the people, he showed untiring\r\nindustry and enthusiastic devotion to the good cause. When he declined,\r\nanother nomination, the State Teachers' Association, at their meeting in\r\nMount Vernon, passed a resolution highly approving his administration.\r\nDavid Tod, then Governor, wrote of him to a friend: \"The most faithful\r\nmanner in which Mr. Smyth has discharged the arduous duties of School\r\nCommissioner of our State for the last six years, involving, as it did,\r\nthe expenditure of millions of money, without the loss of a dollar, has\r\nwon for him my fullest confidence and profound respect. He is an excellent\r\nbusiness man, and a Christian gentleman.\" No man ever left an office\r\nstronger in the confidence and esteem of the people.\r\n\r\nMr. Smyth did not propose to continue longer in the educational field, and\r\ndeclined many invitations to positions at the head of institutions of\r\nlearning. But, very unexpectedly to him, he was elected Superintendent of\r\nInstruction for Cleveland. A strong inclination to reside here, and the\r\nurgency of friends, secured his acceptance. He removed to this city in\r\nJuly, 1863, and was warmly welcomed by the people.\r\n\r\nAt that time, the Board of Education was in many things subordinate to\r\nthe City Council, and these two bodies not always working harmoniously\r\nprevented the adoption of many reforms advocated by the Superintendant.\r\nStill, Mr. Smyth's administration was a period of great prosperity and\r\nadvancement with the Cleveland schools. The gradation and classification\r\nwere improved; modes of teaching were introduced which greatly promoted\r\nthe purposes of education. Through his influence the use of the rod in the\r\nschools was to a great extent discontinued, while better order was\r\nsecured. His success in the selection of teachers was remarkable. He\r\nseemed to have an intuitive knowledge of character, and next to none of\r\nthose he placed in charge of schools proved failures. His power over\r\nteachers was very great. While he was exacting in his demands, never\r\nexcusing negligence, he knew how to temper authority with kind and\r\ncourteous manners.\r\n\r\nIn the management of schools, Mr. Smyth required that due regard be had to\r\nmanners and morals. Arithmetic and grammar were not, in his estimation,\r\nmore important than politeness and Christian morality. He encouraged the\r\nornamentation of the school rooms with plants, flowers and engravings,\r\nwhich has been so generally adopted, thus rendering them attractive and\r\nconducive to taste and refinement.\r\n\r\nFor five successive years Mr. Smyth was re-elected, but the last election\r\nhe declined to accept, having entered into business arrangements, that he\r\nmight pay needed attention to pecuniary interests. During his\r\nsuperintendence the number of teachers employed in the schools increased\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred and thirty; the splendid school buildings now\r\napproaching completion, were planned and put under contract, the School\r\nLibrary was established, and all school interests were most prosperons.\r\nWhen he retired from the superintendence of the schools, nearly two years\r\nago, the Leader expressed the public sentiment in regard to his services,\r\nin the following terms: \"It is with unfeigned regret that we announce the\r\nresignation of Rev. Anson Smyth, as Superintendent of Instruction in this\r\ncity. He has discharged the duties of this office for four years with\r\nability and efficiency. The educational interests of the city have been\r\nguarded with jealous care; and the excellent condition of our public\r\nschools, the firm, judicious discipline that is enforced, and the thorough\r\nsystem of instruction well attest his zeal, ability and faithfulness. To\r\nthe teachers of the schools and the citizens generally, he has given the\r\nmost unqualified satisfaction, and all will sincerely regret the\r\ncircumstances which have induced him to retire.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smyth has never given up pulpit services, but has averaged to preach\r\none sermon per Sunday ever since resigning his pastoral charge in Toledo,\r\neighteen years ago. Though a Presbyterian in doctrine, and loyal to that\r\nchurch, he is remarkably free from sectarian exclusiveness, and all\r\nevangelical churches seek and obtain his ministerial services.\r\n\r\nWithin the last year he has given more than twenty addresses at college\r\ncommencements, and before literary and educational associations, while he\r\nhas been obliged to decline numerous applications for like labors.\r\n\r\nThe weight of fifty years and the work of a life of very great activity\r\nrest lightly upon him. He is possessed of robust health, and is as marked\r\nfor energy and vivacity as he was twenty years ago. But few men, who at\r\nhis age have accomplished so much labor, seem still so able to repeat\r\ntheir life-work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR. F. Humiston.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe family of Humiston, or Humbastone, as it was originally called, is one\r\nof considerable antiquity, and its American branch dates from an early\r\nperiod in the history of this country, John Humbastone, its founder,\r\nhaving settled in New Haven, Connecticut, towards the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. For over two hundred years the family, or a portion\r\nof it, resided in the same neighborhood, about seven miles out of New\r\nHaven, on the Quinnipiac river. At the breaking out of the Revolutionary\r\nWar, several members of the family took part in the struggle on the side\r\nof the patriots, and did good service.\r\n\r\nCaleb Humiston (the name had been corrupted in the course of time) was of\r\nthe third generation in descent from John Humbastone, the original settler\r\nin New Haven. He was born on the old homestead on the Quinnipiac river,\r\ninherited a portion of it, and lived there until he was thirty years old.\r\nThen he removed to Berkshire county, Massachusetts, settling down in 1816\r\non a farm he had purchased in Great Barrington. He was at this time a\r\nfarmer in comfortable circumstances, but misfortune came upon him, his\r\nproperty passed from his control, and he was reduced to extremely narrow\r\ncircumstances. When this misfortune came upon him he had already been\r\nburdened with a large family. Ten children had been born, one of whom\r\ndied, but the others grew up and had to be provided for, the family\r\nconsisting of seven boys and two girls. It is a noteworthy fact, that with\r\nthe exception of the child who died in infancy, and Caleb Humeston\r\nhimself, there has been no death in the family for over half a century,\r\nthe youngest of them now living being thirty-eight years old. The family\r\nhad been noted for its longevity, the average age of the ancestors of the\r\npresent generation being between seventy and eighty years.\r\n\r\nR. F. Humiston, whose life we propose briefly to sketch, was born in Great\r\nBarrington, July 29th, 1821. The misfortune suffered by his father\r\novertook him when R. F. was nine years old, and from that time each one of\r\nthe children was capable to do something towards earning a living. Tools\r\nwere provided for each, proper work marked out, and every one held\r\nresponsible for the faithful performance of the allotted task. As long as\r\ncould be afforded, the children were sent to the district school, but the\r\ngrade of education provided was low, and the knowledge acquired meagre. In\r\nhis ninth year, R. F. Humiston was taken from school and put to earn his\r\nliving with a neighbor, with whom he remained a year, and was then placed\r\nto work in a cotton factory at Stockbridge, Mass. His duty in this\r\nestablishment was to tend a spinning jenny, and the winter hours of labor\r\nwere from six o'clock in the morning to eight at night, with half an\r\nhour's intermission for dinner.\r\n\r\nHis health failing through the severity of this labor, his parents took\r\nhim from this factory and placed him in another factory, for the\r\nmanufacture of cotton batting and wadding, in West Stockbridge. Here he\r\nremained several months, but was obliged to leave on account of sickness.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1833, the family removed to Ohio. After selling his farm\r\nand paying his debts, Caleb Humiston had barely sufficient left with which\r\nto reach Hudson, Ohio. Here he engaged in making brick, the subject of\r\nthis sketch, twelve years old, assisting in the brick yard. Change of\r\nclimate, hard work, and want brought sickness on the whole family, and\r\nbefore R. F. Humiston was fifteen years old the physicians pronounced his\r\nconstitution entirely broken down, and that he could never do severe\r\nlabor. He availed himself of an offer to become clerk of a store in\r\nHudson, and clerked there and in Cleveland until he was sixteen years\r\nold. When clerk in a Cleveland bookstore, the proprietor failed and the\r\nbooks were taken to Buffalo, young Humiston receiving an offer of a\r\nclerkship in that city. This he declined, refusing to desert his family,\r\nwho were in poverty, and working hard. His health having been partially\r\nrestored, he took off his good clothes and re-entered the brick yard,\r\nwhere he remained until he was eighteen years old. Whilst in the store he\r\nhad learned to keep books, and turned this knowledge to account in\r\narranging his fathers business. A number of the better class of citizens\r\nof Hudson insisted on the boy having an education, and a merchant offered\r\nto bear the expense of a collegiate course, but the boy was too useful in\r\nhis father's business to be spared, and so the opportunity was lost.\r\n\r\nBut the brick-making did not suit the boy, who was ambitious, and desirous\r\nof learning. In the Winter after he was eighteen, he went to learn the\r\ntrade of a carpenter, agreeing to pay his father for his unexpired time as\r\nsoon as he became of age. He learned the carpenter's trade of Samuel\r\nJohnson, in Ravenna, an intelligent man, who was highly respected by his\r\nneighbors, and whose influence was of great benefit to his apprentice,\r\nforming correct habits, and giving him moral and intellectual training.\r\n\r\nYoung Humiston was ambitious to excel as a mechanic, and spent his\r\nevenings in studying architecture and examining plans for buildings. There\r\nwas no eight or ten hour system in those days. Mechanics worked from\r\ndaylight to dark, frequently continuing their labors sixteen hours. Under\r\nthis severe strain his health again gave way, and in September, 1841, he\r\nwas reluctantly compelled to abandon the trade of a carpenter, except to\r\nwork about three days in the week in order to pay his board.\r\n\r\nAt this point he determined to gain an education, and endeavor to earn a\r\nliving by his brain, since his muscles failed him. He returned to Hudson\r\nwith the purpose of entering college, his entire capital being ten cents\r\nin money and a few tools, with which he hoped to earn enough to pay for\r\nhis board and tuition. He remained at the college five years, working at\r\nhis trade by the hour, and doing odd jobs, teaching an occasional term,\r\nand working hard as a carpenter in vacations. His studies and labors were\r\nunremitting, sometimes allowing him but three hours' sleep out of the\r\ntwenty-four. As might be expected, his health again gave way, and he was\r\nobliged to leave. The college conferred on him the honorary degree of M.\r\nA., and the Wesleyan University, at Delaware, Ohio, subsequently conferred\r\nthe same degree, both without solicitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: R. F. Humiston.]\r\n\r\nOn leaving college he went into the nursery business, not having physical\r\nstamina sufficient to prosecute his studies for the ministry, as intended.\r\nIn this business he continued directly for eighteen months, and partially\r\nfor five or six years.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1847, he commenced teaching in the public schools in\r\nCuyahoga Falls, and in the following Spring established a private school,\r\nthe Cuyahoga Falls Seminary. At the end of that year he was elected\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction and principal of the high school. He\r\ncontinued his seminary, having assistants, and the privilege being allowed\r\nhim of spending a portion of his time in the management of that\r\nestablishment. In the Fall of 1849, he came to Cleveland and was appointed\r\nprincipal of the Rockwell street grammar school, where he remained seven\r\nyears, bringing up the school from a low pitch to rank among the foremost\r\nin the city. His salary, when he began to teach in Cleveland was but five\r\nhundred dollars, and out of this he had to provide for two families, his\r\nown and that of his parents. To add to his small stipend, he taught\r\nevening school, and took agencies in the vacation. At the same time he was\r\nrepeatedly offered other situations at better salaries, and was invited to\r\nbecome the principal of a State Normal school. He tendered his resignation\r\nas principal of the Rockwell street school, but was induced to remain on\r\npromise of increase of salary. Finally, becoming weary of that hope\r\ndeferred that maketh the heart sick, he resigned and was engaged at a much\r\nhigher salary, to establish, under the patronage of an association of\r\nleading citizens, the Cleveland Academy. This enterprise was very\r\nsuccessful, and the position pleasant, a fine corps of assistants being\r\ngathered around him.\r\n\r\nAfter two years labor in this position, some gentlemen connected with the\r\nproperty on University Heights, requested him to engage in the enterprise\r\nof a school on the Heights, in the building erected for a college under\r\npresident Mahan, but which now lay unfinished and unoccupied, the college\r\nscheme having failed. They offered rent and grounds free, but he refused,\r\nuntil they agreed to sell him the whole property for a nominal sum, if he\r\ncould acquire a clear title, the ownership having become badly involved by\r\nthe failure of the college. This he eventually accomplished after much\r\nlabor, and took possession of the property in 1856.\r\n\r\nThe task was a gigantic one to a man like Mr. Humiston, with limited funds\r\nand uncertain health. The building was unfinished and needed considerable\r\nexpenditure to put it in shape for occupation. The location though very\r\npromising in the distant future, was then very inconvenient of access,\r\nand was therefore objectionable. But Mr. Humiston possessed a determined\r\nwill and he set to work without delay. He borrowed money, fitted up a\r\nportion of the building, and opened the Cleveland Institute with strong\r\nhopes for the future, but gloomy prospects in the present.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the second year the building took fire and a large\r\nportion of the interior was destroyed. The school was closed for six\r\nmonths, and with characteristic energy Mr. Humiston went to work to repair\r\ndamages, enlarging the building, and again involving himself in debt to\r\nmeet the expense. Success crowned his enterprise. The number of scholars\r\nincreased rapidly, and again the building had to be enlarged and improved.\r\n\r\nThe institute was continued ten years, and the gross income in its later\r\nyears ranged from $20,000 to $31,000 per year. During nearly the whole\r\ntime Mr. Humiston taught himself, and usually five hours out of the six\r\ndevoted to studies. At the same time he gave medical lectures at the\r\nWestern Homoeopathic College, and managed all the affairs of the\r\ninstitute, keeping no agent or steward. He purchased and fitted up in\r\nthe institute a fine chemical and philosophical apparatus, collected a\r\ngood library and several valuable cabinets of specimens in natural\r\nhistory, geology, and mineralogy. The corps of teachers was large and of\r\nsuperior talents.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Mr. Humiston, considering that he had earned a respite from his\r\narduous and unremitting labors, accepted an offer from some gentlemen\r\ndesirous of establishing a Homoeopathic Hospital, and sold his building'\r\nwith half the adjoining grounds for $35,000. He then accepted the tender\r\nof the agency of the American Missionary Association in Great Britain,\r\nand early in 1869 left for Europe, having previously visited the South in\r\norder to acquaint himself with the condition of the freedmen, whose cause\r\nhe designed especially to present. After a year or more spent in this\r\nwork he designs visiting the remainder of Europe, North Africa, and the\r\nHoly Land.\r\n\r\nMr. Humiston has, since 1859, held the position of Professor of Chemistry\r\nand Toxicology in the Western Homoeopathic College, and has given ten\r\ncourses of lectures in that institution. Each year he insisted on\r\nresigning, but the resignation has always been refused. On closing his\r\neducational career he again resigned, but the college again refused to\r\naccept his resignation, promising to supply his place temporarily during\r\nhis absence in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristic of Mr. Humiston is his strong will, and\r\nthis is well exemplified in the fact that although born with a\r\nconstitutional fierce thirst for liquor, he has been able to continue in\r\nright habits of temperance through all temptation, though at the cost of\r\nmany powerful struggles with his inordinate cravings. He is a man of\r\nstrong religions convictions, and has been so from his youth up. For many\r\nyears he was connected with the Methodist church on University Heights. As\r\nan educator he ranks among the best in the State, and was held in\r\ndeservedly high esteem by those who had themselves been taught by him, or\r\nwhose children had been brought up under his tuition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRailroading\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst of the railroads of any description chartered in connection with\r\nCleveland were the Cleveland and Newburgh and Cleveland and Bedford\r\nRailroad Companies. The first named was incorporated in 1835, built soon\r\nafter, and for some time run by horse power, hauling stone and timber, and\r\noccasionally passengers. It was eventually abandoned. The Cleveland and\r\nBedford was never built. Another local road, run by horse power, with\r\nwooden rails, was, about the same time, constructed between the city and\r\nEast Cleveland, passing up Euclid street.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Railroad was of a different character. It was intended to run\r\nalong the lake shore from the Pennsylvania line to Toledo, mostly to be\r\nbuilt on piles. Considerable work was done, though no iron laid, when the\r\nfinancial crisis overwhelmed it and its kindred schemes. The piles driven\r\nfor the track are yet visible in places between Cleveland and Sandusky.\r\nThe rights of the company, as far as they existed, afterwards became the\r\nproperty of the Junction Railroad Company, now the Cleveland and Toledo.\r\nOf the same period, was the Cleveland, Warren and Pittsburgh. This was\r\nchartered in 1836, the act of incorporation authorizing the construction\r\nof a railroad from Cleveland, in the direction of Pittsburgh, to the\r\nState line of Pennsylvania. At the point of intersection with the State\r\nline, the charter provided for the union of the road with any other road\r\nwhich the State of Pennsylvania might authorize from Pittsburgh, or any\r\nother point below the Ohio river, running in the direction of Cleveland,\r\nin order that a continuous route might be perfected from Cleveland to\r\nPittsburgh, under the authority of both States. The charter was very\r\nloose in its provisions, allowing the president and directors to create\r\nand sell stock as in their judgement occasion might require, without\r\nlimit as to the amount issued, except that it should not exceed the\r\nneeds of the company. Plenary powers were granted to the company in the\r\nselection of a route, the condemnation of land, and like \"full and\r\ndiscretionary power\" was granted to the company in \"the use and occupancy\r\nof the road, in the transportation of persons or property, either by the\r\nforce and power of steam, or animals, or any mechanical or other power,\r\nor any combination of them, which the company may think proper to\r\nemploy.\" The cost of the line was estimated to be less than $7,000 per\r\nmile. The road was to be an extension of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,\r\na branch of which was to extend to Pittsburgh, and thus would \"give the\r\nwhole vast region of the western lakes an opportunity of marketing their\r\nproducts in, and receiving their foreign produce from Philadelphia and\r\nBaltimore, at least rive weeks earlier in the season, and at much less\r\nexpense,\" than was accomplished at New York.\r\n\r\nIn the same year a charter was obtained for the Cleveland, Columbus\r\nand Cincinnati Railroad, connecting Cleveland and Cincinnati by the\r\nway of Columbus.\r\n\r\nNone of the roads were built under these charters. The financial panic of\r\n1837 swept them all into oblivion, together with a multitude of other\r\nroads projected throughout the country. Some of them were heard of no\r\nmore, and others were revived in after years, the charters greatly\r\namended, and the roads eventually built. The design of the Cleveland,\r\nColumbus and Cincinnati Railroad Company was eventually carried out to the\r\nextent of building a line to Columbus and there connecting with railroads\r\nextending to Cincinnati. The Cleveland, Warren and Pittsburgh charter was\r\ndug up, amended, and made authority for organization of the Cleveland and\r\nPittsburgh Railroad, whilst the original route was mainly occupied by the\r\nnew Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland and Bedford was at last rendered unnecessary by the\r\nCleveland and Pittsburgh passing over its route, whilst the Cleveland and\r\nNewburgh reap-pears as a street railroad, for passengers only, the\r\noriginal design of a local railroad for freight being abandoned thirty odd\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1845, the lapsed charter of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati\r\nRailroad Company was revived, revised, and a new company organized, with\r\nJohn W. Allen, Richard Hilliard, Jolin M. Woolsey and H. B. Payne as\r\nCleveland directors, and John W. Allen as president. Between the\r\norganization of the company and the construction of the road there was a\r\nwide gulf of difficulties, jealousies and enmities, bridged over at last\r\nby untiring perseverance and unwavering faith in the final success of the\r\nundertaking. The story of the struggle is told incidentally in the\r\nbiographical sketches of those connected with the enterprise. All that we\r\nhave to do here is, to briefly sketch the leading features in the\r\nnarrative as it has been already told, after a careful examination of the\r\ndocumentary history of the company. That account says the incorporation\r\nof the company had been obtained in the year 1845, with a proviso\r\nauthorizing the city of Cleveland to subscribe two millions of dollars to\r\nthe stock. The bonds of the city were promptly given, but before any money\r\ncould be obtained upon these bonds it was necessary that a further\r\nsubscription should be made by the citizens, not only to meet the current\r\nexpenses, but to give assurance to capitalists abroad that the people here\r\nwere really in earnest, and would not suffer the undertaking to fall\r\nthrough. After a thorough canvass of the city, by two well known and\r\nrespected citizens, it was found that not more than twenty-five thousand\r\ndollars could be obtained. There was both a scarcity of cash and a lack of\r\nfaith in the enterprise.\r\n\r\nJohn M. Woolsey was sent to Cincinnati to negotiate the city bonds with\r\nthe Ohio Life and Trust Company; to Pittsburgh to ascertain upon what\r\nterms iron could be obtained; and to Philadelphia and New York to enlist\r\nthe sympathy and help of capitalists. The mission was a failure. The\r\ncommon strap iron of that day could not be obtained without cash on\r\ndelivery, and the money could not be procured on any terms. Cleveland was\r\ntoo far off, and entirely unknown to the moneyed men of the eastern\r\ncities. Thus, in the Spring of 1847, one of the very darkest periods in\r\nour history, it was determined to abandon the enterprise for the time, and\r\nawait a more favorable season.\r\n\r\nIn this desperate extremity Mr. Hilliard and Mr. Payne volunteered another\r\nand last effort of three months personal labor to arouse their fellow\r\ncitizens to a proper sense of the importance and ultimate value of this\r\ngrand undertaking. By patient perseverance they succeeded in securing a\r\nleading subscription of five thousand dollars from Leonard Case, who also\r\nconsented to become a director of the company. The ultimate result of the\r\nsolicitations was the subscription of about $40,000 additional to the\r\namount previously pledged. About the same time an accession of the utmost\r\nimportance was made when Alfred Kelley, of Columbus, accepted the\r\npresidency of the road, contrary to his inclination to retire from further\r\npublic duties and to the strong remonstrances of his personal friends.\r\nThrough the influence of Mr. Dwight, of Springfield, Mass., the directors\r\nsecured the services of Captain Childs, well known among Eastern\r\ncapitalists as a skillful engineer, and his endorsement of the company did\r\nmuch to advance its credit abroad. But it was still necessary to secure a\r\nlarge disposal of stock at home, and to effect this, a liberal additional\r\nassessment upon the friends of the road was made and accepted. Mr. Childs\r\nfinally recommended Mr. Harbeck, who, in company with Stillman Witt and\r\nAmasa Stone, Jr., undertook and carried out the building of the road to\r\nits completion.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1851, the first through train arrived from Columbus, bringing\r\nthe State authorities and the Legislature, to celebrate the union of the\r\ntwo cities. Thus the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad was the\r\npioneer of the series of the now enlarged, and most important enterprises\r\nso clearly identified with the growth of the city. The chairman of the\r\nbuilding committee stated at the opening of the new depot, that during the\r\nentire building of that road, there was not a dollar paid as a bribe to\r\neither the Legislature or the City Council, to receive their favors.\r\n\r\nThe terminus of the road at Cleveland was originally intended to be on\r\nScranton's Flats, but it was afterwards determined to bring the road\r\nacross the river to the site of the old New England House. Appreciating\r\nthe importance of extending it to the lake shore, the contractors agreed\r\nto grade the road free of charge from that point to the lake, and it was\r\naccordingly carried forward to its present terminus.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, the road was consolidated with the Bellefontaine line, thus\r\nplacing its western terminus in Indianapolis. Its southern stem had\r\npreviously been extended by way of the Delaware Cut-Off to Springfield,\r\nthus opening another connection with Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nWe have already said that the charter of the Cleveland, Warren and\r\nPittsburgh Railroad, after sleeping for several years, was dug up,\r\namended, and the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad Company organized under\r\nit. The resuscitation of the charter took place in March, 1845, when the\r\nroute was changed from \"the most direct in the direction of Pittsburgh,\"\r\nto \"the most direct, practicable, and least expensive route to the Ohio\r\nriver, at the most suitable point.\" The company organized at Ravenna, in\r\nOctober of the same year, with James Stewart, of Wellsville, as president,\r\nA. G. Cattell, as secretary, and Cyrus Prentiss, as treasurer. The route\r\nwas surveyed, meetings held in aid of the project, and in July, 1847, the\r\nfirst contracts let from Wellsville northward, and the work of\r\nconstruction commenced. The northern end dragged, owing to the slow coming\r\nin of subscriptions, and the work was not fully let until 1849.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1851, the line was opened from Cleveland to Hudson, and the\r\nGeneral Assembly and State officers who had come to Cleveland to attend\r\nthe celebration of the opening of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati\r\nRailroad, accepted an invitation to ride over the new railroad to Hudson.\r\nA short supply of provisions at Hudson, and the ditching of the train on\r\nthe return trip, made the weary and hungry legislators long remember their\r\npioneer trip over the unfinished Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. In\r\nMarch following, the track was completed to Ravenna, in November to\r\nHanover, at which time free passes for \"each stockholder and his lady,\"\r\nand \"landholders through whose land the road passes, with their wives,\"\r\nwere issued, good for one ride over the line and return, that they might\r\nsee the whole of the stupendous undertaking and admire it. In January\r\n1852, connection was made with the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad at\r\nAlliance, and a route thus opened to Pittsburgh, and in March, of the same\r\nyear, the line was opened to Wellsville, and connection with the Ohio\r\nriver perfected, thus completing the work laid out in the amended charter.\r\n\r\nAt different times, subsequently, authority was granted by the General\r\nAssembly for the extension of the line and the construction of branches.\r\nIn this way the River Division was built, connecting the Wellsville end\r\nwith Pittsburgh by a junction with the Ohio and Pennsylvania at Rochester,\r\nand with the Baltimore and Ohio and Central Ohio, by a line to Bellair.\r\nThe Tuscarawas Branch was built to New Philadelphia, and there stopped,\r\nthough its original purpose was to form a connection with the Steubenville\r\nand Indiana Railroad. Authority was also given to build a branch from\r\nHudson towards the Ohio and Pennsylvania and any line running in the\r\ndirection of Columbus. A separate company afterwards constructed this\r\n\"Akron Branch,\" or Cleveland, Zanesville and Cincinnati Railroad, so far\r\nas Millersburgh. The Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad has had a serious\r\nfinancial struggle to go through, but it has come out as an important and\r\nprosperous line. It is now working under a consolidation of earnings with\r\nthe Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago, formerly known as the Ohio and\r\nPennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company, now, after\r\nseveral consolidations and changes of title, forming part of the Lake\r\nShore and Michigan Southern Railroad Company, was part of the general\r\nplan of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad, was built under\r\nmuch of the same influence, and has always been intimately connected\r\nwith it in its working. The charter was obtained by special act in 1848,\r\nand empowered the corporators to build a line by way of Painesville,\r\nthrough Ashtabula county, to the Pennsylvania State line, and to\r\ncontinue their line into that State to any point authorized by the\r\nPennsylvania Legislature. That part of the road extending to Erie, in\r\nthe State of Pennsylvania, was constructed under the charter of the\r\nFranklin Canal Company, passed by the Legislature of Pennsylvania, the\r\n21st day of May, 1846, and amended April 9th, 1849, giving it authority\r\nto construct a railroad.\r\n\r\nThe company was organized August 1st, 1849, by the selection of Alfred\r\nKelley, Samuel L. Seldin, Heman B. Ely, George E. Gillett, David R. Paige,\r\nLaphnor Lake and Peleg P. Sanford as directors, and Heman B. Ely as\r\npresident, and the surveys from Cleveland were made under the\r\nsuperintendence of Frederick Harbeck as chief engineer, and from the State\r\nline to Erie he acted as consulting engineer, filling both situations\r\nuntil his death, which occurred in the month of February, 1851. A contract\r\nfor the construction of the road from Cleveland to the State line of\r\nPennsylvania was made with Frederick Harbeck, A. Stone, Jr., and Stillman\r\nWitt, on the 26th day of July, 1850, but the work progressed slowly for\r\nsix months after the contract was concluded, principally for the reason\r\nthat there was no confidence in the ability of a railroad from Cleveland\r\nto Erie or Buffalo to compete with the lake in the transportation of\r\npersons and property, and the contractors expended more than $100,000 of\r\ntheir means before a like amount could be raised through all other\r\nsources. In the month of January, 1851, the Hon. Alfred Kelley was\r\nappointed general agent of the company with unlimited authority to raise\r\nfunds and press forward the work of completion. He entered upon his duties\r\nwith his usual indomitable perseverance and energy, fully seconded by the\r\ndirectors and contractors, and they had the satisfaction of passing a\r\nlocomotive over its entire length late in the autumn of the year 1852.\r\n\r\nThe act conferring authority on the Franklin Canal Company to construct a\r\nrailroad from the State line of Ohio to the city of Erie, being regarded\r\nby the Legislature of the State of Pennsylvania as doubtful, they\r\nrepealed it on the 28th day of January, 1854. On the 5th day of May,\r\n1856, the Legislature of the State of Pennsylvania passed an act\r\nauthorizing the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company to\r\npurchase the road as constructed from the State line to Erie, and to\r\noperate it under the general law of the State of Pennsylvania, passed the\r\n19th day of February, 1849. The history of the Pennsylvania portion of\r\nthe line reflects no credit on that State. The petty and vexations \"Erie\r\nWar\" in 1854, by which a portion of the people of Erie attempted to\r\nprevent a through connection of the road at that place, and the\r\nunjustifiable expenses to which the company were subjected by the\r\nLegislature, are blots on the record of that State.\r\n\r\nThe road was operated jointly with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati\r\nRailroad until April 1st, 1855, when the management was divided. In 1869,\r\nit was consolidated, first with the Cleveland and Toledo and then with the\r\nMichigan Southern and Buffalo and Erie Railroads. The Cleveland,\r\nPainesville and Ashtabula has been one of the most profitable railroads in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad Company--one of\r\npersistent struggle against apparently insurmountable difficulties, is\r\ntold in great part in the sketch of the life of Jacob Perkins, to whose\r\nlabors and sacrifices the success of the undertaking is in great measure\r\ndue. The road was projected to develope more fully the mineral and\r\nagricultural resource of Trumbull and Mahoning counties, and to find a\r\nmarket for their products in Pittsburgh or Cleveland. Unlike many\r\nprojected railroads, the first object of this line was a local trade; the\r\nthrough business anticipated was a secondary consideration. The Company\r\nwas incorporated in 1851, and the first meeting of stockholders held at,\r\nWarren, Trumbull county, in June, 1852, when $300,000 local subscriptions\r\nwere reported and it was determined to survey and prepare estimates for\r\nthe road. The directors under whom this work was commenced were Jacob\r\nPerkins, Frederick Kinsman and Charles Smith, of Warren, David Tod, of\r\nYoungstown, Dudley Baldwin of Cleveland, Robert Cunningham, of New\r\nCastle, and James Magee, of Philadelphia. In order to aid the enterprise\r\nby securing connections, they opened negotiations with the Pennsylvania\r\nand Ohio Railroad, and the Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad, but without\r\nsuccess. About the same time a contract was made with the Junction\r\nRailroad, afterwards merged in the Cleveland and Toledo Road, for\r\npurchase of ground near the mouth of the Cuyahoga river, on the west\r\nside, and the right of way obtained through a portion of Ohio City, and\r\nthrough Scranton's Hill to the west end of the Columbus street bridge,\r\nnear which the freight depot was afterwards established. In 1853, the\r\nprincipal office of the Company was removed to Cleveland, which was made\r\nthe head quarters of the Company.\r\n\r\nAfter surveying different routes and hesitating over the choice between\r\nthem, it was decided to build the road from Cleveland, on the West Side,\r\nand running through Scranton's hill to Newburgh, Bedford, Aurora, Mantua\r\nand Warren, fifty-three miles, and thence down the Mahoning Valley to\r\nYoungstown and Poland, to the east line of the State.\r\n\r\nRepeated attempts were made to induce the Legislature of Pennsylvania to\r\nauthorize an extension of the road in that State, but owing to the\r\nopposition of the Pittsburgh and Erie Bailroad, and especially of the\r\nPittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago Railroad, the desired permission was\r\nfinally refused. The estimated aggregate cost of the road was about one\r\nand three-quarter millions of dollars, and when the principal contracts\r\nfor labor and iron were made, there was a very fair prospect of disposing\r\nof the bonds of the company to advantage, and thus, in addition to the\r\nloans effected in Philadelphia, New York and at home, the means to\r\ncomplete the work were reasonably anticipated. In the Directors' Report of\r\n1854, they were obliged to announce unlooked for embarrassments, growing\r\nout of the altered condition of the money market. The story of the\r\nseemingly hopeless, but finally successful, struggle that followed is told\r\nin another part of this work. At length, in 1857, after five or six years\r\nof persevering efforts, and most perplexing difficulties, the road was\r\nopened through to Youngstown; substantial machine shops were built at\r\nCleveland, station houses erected along the route, and the coal and iron\r\nof the Mahoning Valley were made accessible by a quick and easy route.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1863, the road was leased for ninety-nine years to the\r\nAtlantic and Great Western Railroad, which had already laid a broad gauge\r\nupon the track, That company now controls the main line to Youngstown,\r\nwith the several branches to Hubbard and the coal mines. The narrow gauge\r\nis kept up for the use of the Mahoning trains, freight and passenger,\r\nwhile the broad gauge is used by the Atlantic and Great Western through\r\ntrains. The track has been extended to the shore of the old river bed, an\r\nextensive wharfage established, and large facilities obtained for\r\nconnecting the traffic of the road with the lake commerce.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland and Toledo Railroad Company was formed by the consolidation\r\nof two rival and nearly parallel lines. One of the companies thus united,\r\nwas incorporated as the Junction Railroad Company, and the other by the\r\nname of the Toledo, Norwalk and Cleveland Railroad Company. The former was\r\nincorporated by an act of the legislature of Ohio, passed on the second\r\nday of March, 1846; and the latter, by an act of the seventh of March,\r\n1850. The Junction Railroad Company, by its original charter and two\r\namendments, in 1861, was authorized to construct a railroad from the city\r\nof Cleveland to the west line of the State by such route as the directors\r\nmight determine, with power to construct branches to any points within the\r\ncounties through which the main line might pass. The charter of the\r\nToledo, Norwalk and Cleveland Railroad Company, authorized the\r\nconstruction of a railroad from Toledo, by the way of Norwalk, in the\r\ncounty of Huron, to a connection with the Cleveland, Columbus, and\r\nCincinnati Railroad, at some point in the counties of Huron or Lorain. The\r\nauthorized capital stock of the Junction Company was three millions, and\r\nthat of the other company, two millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe consolidation was effected, and the new company organized on the first\r\nof September, A. D. 1853, under the specific provisions of the twelfth\r\nsection of the amendment to the Toledo, Norwalk and Cleveland Railroad\r\ncharter, passed on the first of March, 1850. Under its charter, the\r\nToledo, Norwalk and Cleveland Railroad Company constructed a road from the\r\neast bank of the Maumee river, opposite the city of Toledo, to Grafton,\r\nwhere it connects with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad,\r\ntwenty-five miles south-west from the city of Cleveland, being a distance\r\nof eighty-seven and one-half miles, all of which was finished and put into\r\noperation in January, 1853. This became known as the Southern Division of\r\nthe Cleveland and Toledo Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe Northern Division, or Junction Railroad, was originally intended to\r\nrun from Cleveland, west side, via Berea and Sandusky, westward to a point\r\non the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad some twenty miles\r\nwest of Toledo, and crossing the track of the Toledo, Norwalk and\r\nCleveland Railroad at a point about eight miles east of the same city. The\r\nroad was opened between Cleveland and Sandusky and operations commenced\r\nupon it in the Fall of 1858, immediately after the consolidation. The\r\noriginal project of a separate line to the west was carried out by the\r\nconsolidated corporation so far as to construct the road to its\r\nintersection with the old Toledo, Norwalk and Cleveland track, from which\r\npoint both lines approached Toledo over the same right of way. This line\r\nwas operated over its whole length until the 31st day of December, 1858,\r\non which day the use for regular business of that portion lying west of\r\nSandusky was discontinued, and all the through travel and traffic turned\r\nupon the Southern Division. On the 30th of July, 1856, a contract was\r\nentered into with the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad Company\r\nby which the Cleveland and Toledo Company acquired the right to use the\r\ntrack of the first named company from Grafton to Cleveland, for the\r\nSouthern Division trains, and from Berea to Cleveland for the Northern\r\nDivision, and thence forward all trains were run into, and departed from,\r\nthe Union Depot in Cleveland--a change which soon resulted in the\r\npractical abandonment, for the time, of that portion of the Northern\r\nDivision lying between Berea and Cleveland on the west side of Cuyahoga\r\nriver. This arrangement, together with the completion, in 1855, of a\r\nbridge over the Maumee river at Toledo, enabled the company to receive and\r\ndischarge its passengers in union depots at each end of its line. During\r\nthe years 1865 and 1866, about eight miles of new road were constructed\r\nbetween Elyria on the Northern Division, and Oberlin on the Southern\r\nDivision, for the purpose of allowing all trains to leave and come upon\r\nthe Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Road at Berea, thirteen miles,\r\ninstead of Grafton, twenty-five miles from Cleveland. This new piece of\r\nroad was opened for business on the 10th of September, 1866, and the road\r\nbetween Oberlin and Grafton immediately abandoned, The construction of a\r\nbridge near the mouth of the Cuyahoga river at Cleveland, brought the\r\nNorthern Division line between Cleveland and Berea once more into use, and\r\nover it the freight trains of the line are now run. In 1869, the company\r\nwas made part of the Consolidated line between Buffalo and Chicago.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic and Great Western Railroad, by its lease of the Cleveland and\r\nMahoning Railroad, has become an important part of the Cleveland railroad\r\nSystem. The company was organized in 1851, as the Franklin and Warren\r\nRailroad Company, to build a road from Franklin Mills (now Kent) in\r\nPortage County, to Warren, in Trumbull county, with power to extend to a\r\npoint in the eastern line of the State, northeast of Warren and\r\nsouthwesterly to Dayton, Ohio. In July, 1853, operations were actively\r\ncommenced along the whole line, but were soon seriously retarded by\r\nfinancial embarrassments. In 1854, the Franklin and Warren Railroad\r\nCompany, under authority of an Act of the General Assembly of 1853,\r\nchanged its name to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company. Two\r\nyears before, a project had been started to extend the broad gauge of the\r\nOhio and Mississippi Railroad through Ohio, northeastern Pennsylvania and\r\nsouthwestern New York, to connect with the New York and Erie Railroad.\r\nThis route would run through Meadville, Pennsylvania, Warren, Kent, Akron\r\nand Galion to Dayton, Ohio. In 1858, the Meadville Railroad Company\r\nchanged their name to the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad Company of\r\nPennsylvania. In 1859, a company was organized in the State of New York,\r\nunder the name of the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad in New York, and\r\npurchased in 1860 of the New York and Erie Railroad Company thirty eight\r\nmiles of their road, from Salamanca to near Ashville. These thirty eight\r\nmiles with eleven miles of new line, make up the entire length of line of\r\nthis road in the State of New York. Each of the above companies made\r\ncontracts for the building of their respective roads.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1858, negotiations were commenced in London with James\r\nMcHenry, for the means to carry on the work. T. W. Kennard, a civil\r\nengineer, came over as the attorney of Mr. McHenry, and engineer in chief\r\nof the whole work. In 1862, the road was opened from Corry to Meadville,\r\nPennsylvania. In 1863, it was extended to Warren, and in the next year to\r\nRavenna and Akron--202 miles from Salamanca.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1863, the three companies above named, leased for ninety-nine\r\nyears, the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad, extending from Cleveland\r\nsoutherly to Youngstown, Ohio, sixty-seven miles. This road has a narrow\r\ngauge track crossing the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad at\r\nLeavittsburgh, Ohio, fifty miles south of Cleveland. The Atlantic and\r\nGreat Western Company laid a rail on either side of the narrow track, thus\r\ncarrying the broad gauge into Cleveland, and a broad gauge train from the\r\ncity of New York entered Cleveland on the evening of November 3rd, 1863.\r\nSubsequently the several companies forming the Atlantic and Great Western\r\nline were consolidated into one line, and this again was, in 1869,\r\nconsolidated with the Erie Railway.\r\n\r\nBesides opening a new and important thoroughfare to the East, this line\r\nhas opened up to Cleveland the resources of north-western Pennsylvania,\r\nand in the oil product has added an immense and highly profitable trade to\r\nthe business of the city.\r\n\r\nSeveral lines have been built, connecting with and adding business to the\r\nrailroads leading to Cleveland, but of these it is not the province of\r\nthis work to speak. A large number of new railroads have been from time to\r\ntime projected in various directions. Some of these \"paper railroads\" have\r\nintrinsic merit, and these, or lines aiming at the same objects, will\r\neventually be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly, Jacob Perkins]\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Perkins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Perkins was born at Warren, Trumbull county, Ohio, September 1st,\r\n1822, being next to the youngest of the children of Gen. Simon Perkins,\r\none of the earliest and most prominent, business men of norther Ohio, a\r\nland agent of large business, and the owner of extensive tracts of land.\r\nIn his early years Jacob Perkins developed a strong inclination for study,\r\nacquiring knowledge with unusual facility, and gratifying his intense\r\npassion for reading useful works by every means within his power.\r\n\r\nHe commenced fitting himself for college at the Burton Academy, then under\r\nthe direction of Mr. H. L. Hitchcock, now president of Western Reserve\r\nCollege, and completed his preparation at Middletown, Connecticut, in the\r\nschool of Isaac Webb. He entered Yale College in 1837.\r\n\r\nWhile in college he was distinguished for the elegance of his style and\r\nthe wide range of his literary acquirements. He delivered the philosophic\r\noration at his junior exhibition, and was chosen second editor of \"Yale\r\nLiterary Magazine,\" a position in which he took great interest, and filled\r\nto the satisfaction and pride of his class. His college course was,\r\nhowever, interrupted by a long and severe illness before the close of his\r\njunior year, which compelled him to leave his studies and (to his\r\npermanent regret) prevented him from graduating with his own class. He\r\nreturned the following year and was graduated with the class of 1842.\r\n\r\nHe entered his father's office at Warren, and was occupied with its\r\nbusiness until, upon the death of his father, some two years afterwards,\r\nhe became one of his executors.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence at Warren he appeared occasionally before home\r\naudiences as a public speaker, and always with great acceptance.\r\n\r\nIn politics, he early adopted strong anti-slavery principles, then not the\r\npopular doctrine, and they were always freely and openly advocated. Of an\r\naddress delivered in 1848, which was published and attracted very\r\nconsiderable local attention, the editor of the Chronicle remarked, \"We\r\nhave listened to the best orators of the land, from the Connecticut to\r\nthe Mississippi, and can truly say, by none have we been so thoroughly\r\ndelighted in every particular as by this effort of our distinguished\r\ntownsman.\" The oration discussed the true theory of human rights and the\r\nlegitimate powers of human government--and the following extract gives the\r\nspirit of his political principles on the subject of slavery:\r\n\r\nThe object of law is not to make rights, but to define and maintain them;\r\nman possesses them before the existence of law, the same as he does\r\nafterwards. No matter what government may extend its control over him; no\r\nmatter how miserable or how sinful the mother in whose arms his eyes\r\nopened to the day; no matter in what hovel his infancy is nursed; no\r\nmatter what complexion--an Indian or an African sun may have burned upon\r\nhim, this may decide the privileges which he is able to assert, but can\r\nnot affect the existence of his rights. His self-mastery is the gift of\r\nhis creator, and oppression, only, can take it away.\r\n\r\nWithout solicitation he was nominated and elected a member of the\r\nConvention that framed the present Constitution of Ohio. His associates\r\nfrom the district were Judges Peter Hitchcock and R. P. Ranney, and\r\nalthough \"he was the youngest member but one of the Convention--and in the\r\nminority, his influence and position were excelled by few.\"\r\n\r\nHe was one of the Senatorial Presidential Electors for Ohio on the Fremont\r\nticket in 1856.\r\n\r\nIn the intellectual progress of the young about him, and the building up\r\nof schools and colleges, he took especial interest. He first suggested and\r\nurged upon President Pierce to adopt the conditions of the present\r\n\"Permanent Fund of Western Reserve College,\" rather than to solicit\r\nunconditional contributions, which experience had proved were so easily\r\nabsorbed by present necessities, and left the future as poor as the past.\r\nIn connection with his brothers, he made the first subscription to that\r\nfund. The embarrassment arising from his railroad enterprise prevented him\r\nfrom increasing that contribution. The wisdom of his suggestions was\r\nsubsequently shown, when, during the rupture and consequent embarrassment\r\nunder which the college labored, the income of this fund had a very\r\nimportant, if not vital share in saving it from abandonment, and\r\nafterwards proved the nucleus of its present endowment.\r\n\r\nHe was always efficient in favoring improvements. He was associated with\r\nHon. F. Kinsman and his brother in founding the beautiful Woodland\r\nCemetery at Warren. The land was purchased and the ground laid out by\r\nthem, and then transferred to the present corporation.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from the Constitutional Convention, he became\r\ninterested in the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad. He was most\r\ninfluential in obtaining the charter and organizing the company, of\r\nwhich he was elected president, and became the principal, almost sole\r\nfinancial manager.\r\n\r\nOwing to prior and conflicting railroad interests, little aid could be\r\nobtained for his project in either of the terminal cities, Cleveland and\r\nPittsburgh, and the work was commenced in 1853 with a comparatively small\r\nstock subscription. A tightening money market prevented any considerable\r\nincrease of the stock list, or a favorable disposition of the bonds of the\r\nroad, and the financial crisis a few years afterwards so reduced the value\r\nof the securities of this, as of all unfinished railroads, as practically\r\nto shut them out of the market. In this emergency the alternative\r\npresented itself to Mr. Perkins and his resident directors, either to\r\nabandon the enterprise and bankrupt the company, with the entire loss of\r\nthe amount expended, or to push it forward to completion by the pledge,\r\nand at the risk of their private fortunes, credit, and reputations.\r\n\r\nIn this, the darkest day of the enterprise, Mr. Perkins manifested his\r\nconfidence in its ultimate success, and his generous willingness to meet\r\nfully his share of the hazard to be incurred, by proposing to them,\r\njointly with him, to assume that risk; and agreeing that in case of\r\ndisaster, he would himself pay the first $100,000 of loss, and thereafter\r\nshare it equally with them.\r\n\r\nWith a devotion to the interests entrusted to them, a determination rarely\r\nequalled in the history of our railroad enterprises, they unanimously\r\naccepted this proposition, and determined to complete the road, at least\r\nto a remunerative point in the coal fields of the Mahoning Valley.\r\n\r\nThe financial storm was so much more severe and longer continued than the\r\nwisest had calculated upon, that for years the result was regarded by them\r\nand the friends of the enterprise with painful suspense. In the interest\r\nof the road Mr. Perkins spent the Spring of 1854 in England, without\r\nachieving any important financial results.\r\n\r\nAt length, in 1856, the road was opened to Youngstown, and its receipts,\r\ncarefully husbanded, began slowly to lessen the floating debt, by that\r\ntime grown to frightful proportions, and carried solely by the pledge of\r\nthe private property and credit of the president and Ohio directors. These\r\ndirectors, consisting of Hon. Frederick Kinsman and Charles Smith, of\r\nWarren, Governor David Tod, of Briar Hill, Judge Reuben Hitchcock, of\r\nPainesville, and Dudley Baldwin, of Cleveland, by the free use of their\r\nwidely known and high business credit, without distrust or dissension,\r\nsustained the president through that long and severe trial, a trial which\r\ncan never be realized except by those who shared its burdens. The\r\npresident and these directors should ever be held in honor by the\r\nstockholders of the company, whose investment they saved from utter loss,\r\nand by the business men of the entire Mahoning Valley, and not less by the\r\ncity of Cleveland; for the mining and manufacturing interests developed by\r\ntheir exertions and sacrifices, lie at the very foundation of the present\r\nprosperity of both.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the road was enabled to free itself from financial\r\nembarrassment, so to as commence making a satisfactory return to the\r\nstockholders, which Mr. Perkins was exceedingly anxious to see\r\naccomplished under his own presidency--his failing health compelled him to\r\nleave its active management, and he died before the bright day dawned upon\r\nthe enterprise.\r\n\r\nHe said to a friend during his last illness, with characteristic\r\ndistinctness: \"If I die, you may inscribe on my tomb stone, Died of the\r\nMahoning Railroad;\" so great had been his devotion to the interests of the\r\nroad, and so severe the personal exposures which its supervision had\r\nrequired of him, who was characteristically more thoughtful of every\r\ninterest confided to his care, than of his own health.\r\n\r\nHe was married October 24th, 1850, to Miss Elizabeth O. Tod, daughter of\r\nDr. J. I. Tod, of Milton, Trumbull county, Ohio, and removed his family to\r\nCleveland in 1856. Of three children, only one, Jacob Bishop, survives\r\nhim. Mrs. Perkins died of rapid consumption, June 4th, 1857, and his\r\ndevoted attention at the sick bed of his wife greatly facilitated the\r\ndevelopment of the same insidious disease, which was gradually to\r\nundermine his own naturally vigorous constitution.\r\n\r\nThe business necessities of his road, embarrassed and pressing as they\r\nwere, united with his uniform self-forgetfulness, prevented his giving\r\nattention to his personal comfort and health, long after his friends saw\r\nthe shadow of the destroyer falling upon his path. He was finally, in\r\ngreat prostration of health and strength, compelled to leave the active\r\nduties of the road and spent the latter part of the Winter of 1857-8 in\r\nthe Southern States, but returned in the Spring with little or no\r\nimprovement. He continued to fail; during the Summer and in the Fall of\r\n1858 he again went South in the vain hope of at least physical relief, and\r\ndied in Havana, Cuba, January 12th, 1859. His remains were embalmed and\r\nbrought home by his physician who had accompanied him--and were interred\r\nat Warren, in Woodland Cemetery, where so many of his family repose around\r\nhim. A special train from either end of the Cleveland and Mahoning\r\nRailroad brought the board of directors and an unusually large number of\r\nbusiness and personal friends to join the long procession which followed\r\n\"the last of earth\" to its resting place.\r\n\r\nOne of the editorial notices of his death, at the time, very justly\r\nremarks of him:\r\n\r\n  He was a man of mark, and through strength of talent, moral firmness and\r\n  urbanity of manner, wielded an influence seldom possessed by a man of\r\n  his years. In addition to his remarkable business capacity, Mr. Perkins\r\n  was a man of high literary taste, which was constantly improving and\r\n  enriching his mind. He continued, even amid his pressing-business\r\n  engagements, his habits of study and general reading. Mr. Perkins\r\n  belonged to that exceptional class of cases in which great wealth,\r\n  inherited, does not injure the recipient.\r\n\r\nAn editorial of a Warren paper, mentioning his death, says:\r\n\r\n  He was born in this town in 1821, and from his boyhood exhibited a\r\n  mental capacity and energy which was only the promise of the brilliancy\r\n  of his manhood. To his exertion, his personal influence and liberal\r\n  investment of capital the country is indebted for the Cleveland and\r\n  Mahoning Railroad. To his unremitting labor in this enterprise he has\r\n  sacrificed personal comfort and convenience, and we fear, shortened his\r\n  days by his labors and exposure in bringing the work to completion.\r\n  Known widely as Mr. Perkins has been by his active part in public\r\n  enterprises, his loss will be felt throughout the State, but we who have\r\n  known him both as boy and man, have a deeper interest in him, and the\r\n  sympathies of the people of Warren, with his relatives, will have much\r\n  of the nature of personal grief for one directly connected with them.\r\n\r\nSaid a classmate in the class meeting of 1862:\r\n\r\n  Although his name on the catalogue ranks with the class of 1842, his\r\n  affections were with us, and he always regarded himself of our number.\r\n  He visited New Haven frequently during the latter part of his life, in\r\n  connection with a railway enterprise, in which he was interested, and\r\n  exhibited the same large-heartedness and intellectual superiority which\r\n  won for him universal respect during his college course.\r\n\r\nA gentleman who knew Mr. Perkins intimately, and as a director was\r\nassociated with him in the construction of the Cleveland and Mahoning\r\nRailroad, and in carrying its debt, wrote of him as follows:\r\n\r\n  The management and construction of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad\r\n  by Mr. Perkins, under circumstances the most difficult and trying, were\r\n  well calculated to test his powers, and, in that work he proved himself\r\n  possessed of business capacity rarely equalled, sustained by\r\n  unquestioned integrity, and remarkable energy. These qualifications,\r\n  united with his large wealth, gave him the requisite influence with\r\n  business men and capitalists. His devotion to the interests of the road,\r\n  his abiding confidence in a favorable result, and his clear and just\r\n  appreciation of its value, and importance to the community, called forth\r\n  his best efforts, and were essential conditions of success. To him more\r\n  than to any other individual are the projection, inauguration, and\r\n  accomplishment of this enterprise attributable. From its earliest\r\n  projection, he had a most comprehensive and clear view of its importance\r\n  to the city of Cleveland and the Mahoning Valley, and confidently\r\n  anticipated for them, in the event of its completion, a rapidity and\r\n  extent of development and prosperity, which were then regarded as\r\n  visionary, but which the result has fully demonstrated.\r\n\r\n  His life was spared to witness only the commencement of this prosperity,\r\n  nor can it be doubted, that his close application, and unremitting\r\n  efforts to forward the work shortened his life materially. His deep and\r\n  absorbing interest in it, prevented the precautionary measures and\r\n  relaxations, which in all probability would have prolonged his life for\r\n  years. His associates in the board saw the danger and urged him to\r\n  earlier and more decided measures for relief. He too was aware of their\r\n  importance. But the constant demand upon his time and strength, and the\r\n  continually recurring necessities of the enterprise, which he had so\r\n  much at heart, were urgent, and so absorbed his thoughts and energies,\r\n  that he delayed until it was obvious that relaxation could afford merely\r\n  temporary relief.\r\n\r\n  In his intercourse with the board, Mr. Perkins was uniformly courteous\r\n  and gentlemanly, always giving respectful attention to the suggestions\r\n  of his associates, but ever proving himself thoroughly posted; readily\r\n  comprehending the most judicious measures, and clearly demonstrating\r\n  their wisdom. Entire harmony in the action of the directors was the\r\n  result, and all had the fullest confidence in him. While his business\r\n  capacity and integrity commanded their highest admiration, his urbanity,\r\n  kindness and marked social qualities secured their strong personal\r\n  attachment, and by them his decease was regarded as a severe personal\r\n  affliction, as well as a great public loss.\r\n\r\nThus is briefly noticed, one who dying comparatively early, had given\r\nevidence of great business capacity, as well as the promise of unusual\r\npower and popularity with the people of his own State, and nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA work professing to give sketches, however brief and incomplete, of the\r\nrepresentative men of Cleveland, would be manifestly defective did it omit\r\nnotice of the late William Case, a gentleman of sterling worth and great\r\npopularity, who was identified with much of the material progress of the\r\ncity, who had a host of deeply attached friends while living, and whose\r\nmemory is cherished with affectionate esteem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William Case]\r\n\r\nWilliam Case was born to prosperity, but this, which to very many has\r\nproved the greatest misfortune of their lives, was to him no evil, but, on\r\nthe contrary, a good, inasmuch as it gave him opportunity for gratifying\r\nhis liberal tastes, and his desire to advance the general welfare. From\r\nhis father, Leonard Case, he inherited an extraordinary business capacity,\r\nindomitable energy, and strong common sense, with correct habits. To these\r\ninherited traits he added an extensive knowledge, acquired both from books\r\nand men, and made practical by keen observation, and liberal ideas, which\r\nhe carried into his business and social affairs. In all relations of life\r\nhe was ever a gentleman, in the true meaning of the word, courteous to\r\nall, the rich and the poor alike, and with an instinctive repugnance to\r\neverything mean, oppressive or hypocritical. With regard to himself, he\r\nwas modest to a fault, shrinking from everything that might by any\r\npossibility be construed into ostentation or self-glorification. This\r\ntribute the writer of these lines,--who owed him nothing but friendship,\r\nand who was in no way a recipient of any favor from him, other than his\r\ngood will,--is glad of an opportunity to pay, and this testimony to his\r\ngood qualities, falls short of the facts.\r\n\r\nWilliam Case takes his place in this department of our work by virtue of\r\nthe fact that he was an early friend to the railroad enterprises of\r\nCleveland. He contributed largely to the Cleveland, Painesville and\r\nAshtabula Railroad, and for four years and a half, until August, 1858, was\r\npresident of that company. Under his management the railroad prospered and\r\npaid large dividends, and when he left that position it was with the\r\nregret of all his subordinates, whose esteem had been won by his kindness\r\nand courtesy.\r\n\r\nBut it was not alone as a railroad man that Mr. Case won for himself the\r\ntitle to a place among the leading representative men of the city. He grew\r\nup with Cleveland, and was alive to the interests of the growing city. No\r\nscheme of real improvement but found a friend in him. He was energetic in\r\nforwarding movements for bettering the condition of the streets; he took a\r\nleading part in the location and establishment of the Water Works. Anxious\r\nto effect an improvement in the business architecture of the city, in\r\nwhich Cleveland was so far behind cities of less pretension, he projected\r\nand carried on far towards completion the Case Block, which stands to-day\r\nthe largest and most noticeable business building in the city, and which\r\ncontains one of the finest public halls in the West. Mr. Case died before\r\ncompletion of the building, which unforeseen difficulties made of great\r\ncost, but his plans so far as known--including some of great generosity,\r\nsuch as the donation of a fine suite of rooms to the Cleveland Library\r\nAssociation--have been faithfully carried out.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Mr. Case was elected member of the City Council from the Second\r\nWard, and served in that position four years. In that body he was noted\r\nfor his advocacy of every measure tending to the improvement of the city,\r\nand the development of its industrial and commercial resources.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1850, he was nominated, on the Whig ticket, for mayor of\r\nCleveland, and was elected by a large majority, against a strong\r\nDemocratic opponent, his personal popularity being shown by his running\r\nahead of his ticket. His administration was marked with such energy,\r\nability and public spirit, that in the following year--the office then\r\nbeing annually elective--he was re-elected by an increased majority, and\r\nran still further ahead of his ticket.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, the Whig convention for the Nineteenth Congressional District,\r\nwhich then included Cuyahoga county, assembled at Painesville, under the\r\npresidency of Mon. Peter Hitchcock. Mr. Case was there nominated for\r\nCongress by acclamation, and the canvass was carried on by the Whigs with\r\ngreat enthusiasm. But the Democracy and the Free Soil party were against\r\nhim, and under the excitement growing out of anti-slavery agitation, the\r\nFree Soil candidate, Hon. Edward Wade, was elected, though closely pressed\r\nby Mr. Case. From that time Mr. Case, who was not in any respect a\r\npolitician, and who had at no time a desire or need for office, took no\r\nactive part in politics.\r\n\r\nMr. Case did not possess a strong constitution, and early in life his\r\nmedical attendant reported against his being sent to college, as the\r\napplication would be too severe a strain on his health. In accordance with\r\nthe advice then given, he devoted much attention to hunting, fishing, and\r\nto horticultural and agricultural pursuits. But these were insufficient to\r\nsave him, and he died April 19th, 1862, whilst yet in the prime of life,\r\nbeing but forty years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmasa Stone, Jr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the railroad managers connected with Cleveland, indeed\r\noccupying a prominent position in the list of the railroad magnates of the\r\ncountry, is the name of Amasa Stone, Jr. The high position he has\r\nattained, and the wealth he has secured, are the rewards of his own\r\nperseverance, industry, and foresight; every dollar he has earned\r\nrepresents a material benefit to the public at large in the increase of\r\nmanufacturing or traveling facilities.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone was born in the town of Charlton, Worcester county,\r\nMassachusetts, April 27th, 1818. He is of Puritan stock, the founder\r\nof the American branch of the family having-landed at Boston in 1632,\r\nfrom the ship Increase, which brought a colony of Puritans from\r\nEngland. The first settlement of the family was at Waltham. The father\r\nof Mr. Stone, also named Amasa, is now alive, hale and hearty, at the\r\nage of ninety years.\r\n\r\nYoung Amasa Stone lived with his parents and worked upon the farm,\r\nattending the town district school in its sessions, until he was seventeen\r\nyears old, when he engaged with an older brother for three years, to learn\r\nthe trade of a builder. His pay for the first year was to be forty\r\ndollars, increasing ten dollars yearly, and to furnish his own clothing.\r\nAt the end of the second year, thinking he could do better, he purchased\r\nthe remainder of his time for a nominal sum, and from that time was his\r\nown master. In the Winter of 1837-8, he attended the academy of Professer\r\nBailey, in Worcester, Mass., having saved sufficient from his small wages\r\nto pay the expenses of a single term.\r\n\r\nHis first work on his own account was a contract to do the joiner work of\r\na house building by Col. Temple, at Worcester. The work was done, and in\r\npart payment he took a note of a manufacturing firm for $130; within a\r\nfew months the firm failed, the note became worthless, and the first\r\nearnings of the young builder were lost. That note Mr. Stone still\r\npreserves as a memento.\r\n\r\nThe following year, at the age of twenty, he joined his two older brothers\r\nin a contract for the construction of a church edifice in the town of East\r\nBrookfield, Mass. In the succeeding year, 1839, he engaged with his\r\nbrother-in-law, Mr. William Howe, to act as foreman in the erection of\r\ntwo church edifices and several dwelling-houses in Warren, Mass.\r\n\r\nDuring this time Mr. Howe was engaged in perfecting his invention of what\r\nis known as the Howe truss bridge. After securing his patent Mr. Howe\r\ncontracted to build the superstructure of the bridge across the\r\nConnecticut river, at Springfield, for the Western Railroad Company. Mr.\r\nStone engaged with him in this work. During a part of the first year he\r\nwas employed on the foundations of the structure in the bed of the river.\r\nThereafter until the year 1842, he was employed constantly by Mr. Howe in\r\nthe erection of railway and other bridges, and railway depot buildings. In\r\nthe Winter of 1841, his duties were most trying and arduous. About a\r\nthousand lineal feet of bridging on the Western Railroad, in the Green\r\nMountains, had to be completed, and Mr. Stone and his men were called upon\r\nto carry the work through. In some locations the sun could scarcely be\r\nseen, the gorges were so deep and narrow, while during a large portion of\r\nthe time the thermometer ranged below zero. But the work was successfully\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1842, he formed a copartnership with Mr. A. Boody, and\r\npurchased from Mr. Howe his bridge patent for the New England States,\r\nincluding all improvements and renewals. Subsequently an arrangement was\r\nconcluded with Mr. D. L. Harris, under the name of Boody, Stone & Co., for\r\nthe purpose of contracting for the construction of railways, railway\r\nbridges, and similar work, the mechanical details generally to be under\r\nthe charge of Mr. Stone. In the year 1845, Mr. Stone was appointed\r\nsuperintendent of the New Haven, Hartford and Springfield Railroad, he,\r\nhowever, still continuing his partnership in the firm of Boody, Stone &\r\nCo., and the business of the firm becoming so heavy that within a year\r\nfrom the time of his appointment he resigned his office as superintendent.\r\n\r\nCircumstances occurred previous to his appointment that may be worthy of\r\nremark. The purchase of the bridge patent, before alluded to, was for the\r\nsum of forty thousand dollars, to be paid in annual instalments. A few\r\nyears after the purchase some defects showed themselves in the bridges\r\nthat had been erected on this plan, and many prominent engineers had come\r\nto the conclusion that it was not superior to, if it equalled, the truss\r\nplan of Col. Long, the arch and truss of Burr, or the lattice plan of\r\nIthial Towne, and the firm of Boody, Stone & Co. began to fear that they\r\nhad made a bad bargain in the purchase of the patent. Mr. Stone, in\r\nrelating the incident to a friend, said: \"I came to the conclusion that\r\nsomething must be done or there must be a failure, and it must not be a\r\nfailure. The night following was a sleepless one, at least until three\r\no'clock in the morning. I thought, and rolled and tumbled, until time and\r\nagain I was almost exhausted in my inventive thoughts, and in despair,\r\nwhen at last an idea came to my mind that relieved me. I perfected it in\r\nmy mind's eye, and then came to the conclusion that it would not only\r\nrestore the reputation of the Howe bridge, but would prove to be a better\r\ncombination of wood and iron for bridges than then existed, and could not\r\nand would not in principle be improved upon. Sleep immediately came. I\r\nafterwards, with models, proved my conclusions and have not, up to this\r\ntime, changed them.\" It seems that the invention consisted in the\r\nintroduction of longitudinal keys and clamps in the lower chords, to\r\nprevent their elongation, and iron socket bearings instead of wooden for\r\nthe braces and bolts, to avoid compression and shrinkage of the timber,\r\nwhich was the great defect in the original invention, and the adoption of\r\nsingle instead of double intersection in the arrangement of the braces,\r\nthe latter being the arrangement in the original invention.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1846, an incident occurred that may be worthy of\r\nnotice. On the 14th day of October, when walking in Broadway, New York,\r\nMr. Stone met the president of the New Haven, Hartford and Springfield\r\nRailroad, who had in his hand a telegram, stating that the bridge across\r\nthe Connecticut river at Enfield Falls, one-fourth of a mile long, had\r\nbeen carried away by a hurricane. The president asked the advice of Mr.\r\nStone, who stated that the timber for that structure was furnished by\r\nMessrs. Campbell & Moody, of that city, and advised that he order it\r\nduplicated at once. The president, a very faithful officer, but\r\ndisinclined to take responsibilities, asked Mr. Stone to take the\r\nresponsibility of ordering it. Mr. Stone replied, \"Not unless I am\r\npresident.\" The timber was, however, ordered, and at the request of the\r\npresident, Mr. Stone went immediately with him to Springfield, where a\r\ncommittee of the board was called together, and he was asked to propose\r\nterms, and the shortest time upon which his firm would contract to\r\ncomplete the bridge. He stated that his terms would be high, as the\r\nseason was late and would likely be unfavorable before so heavy a work\r\ncould be completed, and further suggested that if they chose to appoint\r\nhim manager of the work, he would accept and do the best he could for\r\nthem. He was immediately appointed sole manager of the work, and the\r\nboard placed at his control all the resources of the company. The work\r\nwas immediately commenced by bringing to the site men and material, and\r\nit was completed, and a locomotive and train of cars run across it by\r\nMr. Stone within forty days from the day the order was given for its\r\nerection. The structure consisted of seven spans of seventy-seven feet\r\neach, with two other spans at each end of about fifty feet each. Mr.\r\nStone has been heard to state that he regarded this as one of the most\r\nimportant events of his life, and that no one was more astonished than\r\nhimself at the result. He was rewarded by complimentary resolutions, and\r\na check for one thousand dollars by the company.\r\n\r\nThe following Winter the partnership of Boody, Stone & Co. was dissolved\r\nby mutual consent, and the territory that their contract for the bridge\r\npatent covered was divided, by Mr. Stone taking the States of\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, and Mr. Boody the other three\r\nStates. A new partnership was then formed between Mr. Stone and Mr.\r\nHarris, which continued until the year 1849.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1839 to 1850, the residence of Mr. Stone, most of the time,\r\nwas in Springfield, Mass., but the numerous contracts in which he was\r\ninterested called him into ten different States, He served several years\r\nas a director in the Agawam Bank, was also a director for several years,\r\nand one of the building committee in the Agawam Canal Company, which\r\nerected and run a cotton mill of ten thousand spindles, in the town of\r\nWest Springfield.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1848, he formed a partnership with Mr. Stillman Witt and\r\nMr. Frederick Harbach, who contracted with the Cleveland, Columbus and\r\nCincinnati Railroad Company to construct and equip the road from Cleveland\r\nto Columbus. This was the largest contract that had, at that time, been\r\nentered into, of this character, by any one party or firm in the United\r\nStates. A large amount of the capital stock was taken in part payment for\r\nthe work. It was generally regarded as a hazardous adventure, but the work\r\nwas carried through in accordance with the terms of the contract, and\r\nproved to be a profitable investment for its stockholders. In his\r\npartnership contract it was stipulated that he was to act as financial\r\nagent at the East, to send out the necessary mechanics, and to\r\noccasionally visit the work, but was not to change his residence. Events,\r\nhowever, occurred that required his constant presence in Ohio, and in the\r\nSpring of 1850, he moved his family to Cleveland, where they have since\r\nresided. In the Winter of 1850-1, the road was opened for business through\r\nfrom Cleveland to Columbus, and Mr. Stone was appointed its\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Respectfully, Amasa Stone, Jr.]\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1850, the firm of Harbach, Stone & Witt contracted with\r\nthe Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company to construct the\r\nrailroad from Cleveland to the State line of Pennsylvania, and furnish it\r\nwith cars, and to take in part payment for the work a large amount of the\r\nstock and bonds of the Company. Soon after the execution of this contract,\r\nMr. Harbach died suddenly in the city of New York, and the completion of\r\nthe work devolved on Messrs. Stone and Witt. The completion of the road\r\nthrough to Erie principally devolved upon the Cleveland company, and was\r\nattended with many difficulties, as the Legislature of Pennsylvania seemed\r\ndetermined that no road should be built through the State along the shore\r\nof Lake Erie, and the general impression was, at that time, that the\r\nconstruction of a road along the shore of the lake was a wild scheme and\r\nwould prove a failure. It was difficult to get capital subscribed and more\r\ndifficult to collect instalments. The contractors having confidence in its\r\nsuccess, prosecuted the work with vigor up to a period when they found\r\nthey had expended more than $200,000, while the aggregate amount that the\r\nrailroad company was able to raise and pay them was less than $100,000. An\r\neffort was then made, with success, to engage the services of Mr. Alfred\r\nKelley. His well known character, aided by the reputation of others who\r\nwere elected directors, and a subscription from the city of Cleveland of\r\n$100,000, enabled the company to meet its engagements with the\r\ncontractors, who carried the work forward to completion, and the road was\r\nopened through to Erie in the Winter of 1852, when Mr. Stone was appointed\r\nits superintendent. Notwithstanding the great expense that had to be\r\nincurred in crossing the deep ravines in the State of Pennsylvania, and\r\nthe heavy burdens imposed on the company by that State, it has proved to\r\nbe one of the most successful railroad enterprises in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1852, Mr. Stone was elected a director in both Cleveland,\r\nColumbus and Cincinnati, and the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula\r\nRailroad Companies, and has held that office in both companies\r\ncontinuously up to the present date. He also continued to hold the office\r\nof superintendent of both roads until the year 1854, when he insisted on\r\nbeing relieved in consequence of failing health, caused by the arduous\r\nlabors which seemed unavoidably to devolve upon him. He was elected\r\npresident of the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company in\r\nthe year 1857, which office he has continued to hold for twelve successive\r\nyears, until 1869.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad was leased perpetually to the\r\nCleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company, at which time he\r\nwas also elected President of the former company.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1855, he, with Mr. Witt, contracted to build the Chicago and\r\nMilwaukee Railroad, and was for many years a director in that company, and\r\nfor awhile its president.\r\n\r\nFor several years he held the office of director in the Merchants Bank, of\r\nCleveland. From its first organization until it was closed up, he was\r\ndirector in the Bank of Commerce, of Cleveland, and has been director in\r\nthe Second National Bank, and the Commercial National Bank, of Cleveland,\r\nand the Cleveland Banking Company, from the time of their respective\r\norganizations until the present time. He was for some years president of\r\nthe Toledo Branch of the State Bank, at Toledo. He was elected a director\r\nin the Jamestown and Franklin Railroad Company in the year 1863, which\r\noffice he has held until the present time. In the same year he was elected\r\npresident of the Mercer Iron and Coal Company and held the office until\r\nthe close of the year 1868.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone aided in the establishment of several manufactories at this\r\npoint. During the construction of the railroads from Cleveland, his firm\r\ncarried on extensive car shops in the city, where cars were constructed,\r\nnot only for those two roads, but for several others. He gave financial\r\naid and personal influence to the establishment and maintenance of several\r\nleading iron manufacturing establishments and machine shops. In the year\r\n1861-2, he erected, in the city of Cleveland, a woolen mill of five sets\r\nof machinery, and for several years ran it and turned out more goods\r\nannually than any other mill in the state of Ohio. He subsequently sold it\r\nto Alton Pope & Sons.\r\n\r\nHe is often pleased to note the progress in American enterprise, and among\r\nother events that has come under his own observation, relates the\r\nfollowing: In the year 1839, he commenced his first railroad service upon\r\nthe foundation of a bridge that was then being erected across the\r\nConnecticut river at Springfield, Mass., of 1260 feet in length. It was\r\nregarded as a very difficult undertaking, as the bed of the river was\r\ncomposed mostly of quicksand, and a rise of 25-1/2 feet in the river had\r\nto be provided for, and floating ice, its full width, fifteen inches in\r\nthickness. Maj. George W. Whistler, the first of his profession, was chief\r\nengineer of the work, and he had as advisers Maj. McNeal, Capt. Swift, and\r\nother eminent engineers. The work was about three years under\r\nconstruction, at a cost of over $131,000, and every effort was made to\r\nkeep its cost at the lowest possible point, at the same time making\r\ncertain the stability of the structure. Within nine years from the time of\r\nits completion, a similar structure, in every particular, was to be\r\nconstructed across the same river, at Hartford, twenty-six miles below.\r\nIts length varied but a few feet, although it covered more water, and its\r\nfoundations and other contingencies were quite as difficult and\r\nunfavorable. Mr. Stone concluded a contract for its construction for the\r\nfirm of Stone & Harris, complete, for the sum of $77,000, and to have it\r\nready for the cars in twenty months. The work was executed in accordance\r\nwith the terms of the contract, and has not only proved as substantial as\r\nthat at Springfield, but in many particulars, more so. It was the pride of\r\nMr. Stone for many reasons, (among others, that it was stated by many that\r\nit could not be done for this sum of money,) to personally superintend\r\nthis work himself, and to put in practice some of his own inventions, the\r\nmost important of which was the cutting off the foundation piles with a\r\nsaw arranged on a scow, propelled by a steam engine, and the sinking of\r\nthe piers below water by means of screws. The result proved to be\r\nsatisfactory, and as favorable, in a financial point of view, as he\r\nestimated. It will be noticed that the bridge structure, complete, at\r\nHartford, cost $54,000 less than that at Springfield, of like character.\r\n\r\nHe has been interested in the construction of more than ten miles in\r\nlength of truss bridging, and in the construction of roofs of large\r\nbuildings, covering more than fifteen acres of ground, most of which he\r\ndesigned and personally superintended their election. The last extensive\r\nstructure that he designed, and the election of which he personally\r\nsuperintended, was the Union Passenger Depot, at Cleveland. He was the\r\nfirst person that designed and erected pivot draw-bridges of long spans,\r\nwhich, however, have been much increased in length of span by other\r\nparties since. He was also the first to design and erect a dome roof of a\r\nspan of 150 feet, sufficient to cover three lengths of a locomotive with\r\nits tender, and numerous are the improvements he has introduced in the\r\nconstruction of railroad cars and locomotives. The only eight-wheeled dump\r\ngravel car in successful use was designed and put in practice by him.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years Mr. Stone has been trustee of the First Presbyterian\r\nChurch Society of Cleveland, and still holds that office. He was chairman\r\nof the building committee in the election of the new church edifice, and\r\nwhen it was burned down, was again elected chairman of the building\r\ncommittee, and given full charge of the reconstruction of the building.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Mr. Stone visited Europe, being compelled to seek relief, for a\r\nbrief period, from the exhausting cares of his numerous business\r\nengagements. He is expected to return in the Fall of this year, ready to\r\nagain engage in the active prosecution of the important enterprises with\r\nwhich he is connected, and in which he has won such distinction by his\r\nsound common sense, sound judgment, unresting energy, and practicable\r\nknowledge. In whatever he undertakes there is good reason for believing\r\nthat the success he has hitherto met will still attend his efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStillman Witt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConnected indissolubly with the story of the rise and progress of the\r\nimportant railroad interests of Cleveland and northern Ohio, is the name\r\nof Stillman Witt. As one of the builders of the pioneer railroad from the\r\ncity, and of the next in point of time, which has since become one of the\r\nforemost lines of the country in importance and profitableness, Mr. Witt\r\ndeserves honorable record among the men who have contributed most to make\r\nCleveland what it is to-day, a rich, populous, and rapidly growing city.\r\n\r\nStillman Witt is a self-made man, and unlike some of this class, his\r\nself-manufacture will stand the test of close criticism. The material has\r\nnot been spoiled or warped in the process. Those who know him best know\r\nthat the struggles of his early years have not soured his disposition or\r\nhardened his feelings, and that access of fortune has not made him\r\npurse-proud. The Stillman Witt of to-day, rich and influential, is the\r\nsame Stillman Witt who paddled a ferry boat at about forty cents a day,\r\nand was happy in his good fortune.\r\n\r\nMr. Witt was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, January 4th, 1808. His\r\nparentage was humble, and, in consequence, his facilities for obtaining an\r\neducation very limited. When about thirteen years old, his father moved\r\nwith his family to Troy, New York, where young Stillman was hired by\r\nRichard P. Hart to run a skiff ferry, the wages being ten dollars per\r\nmonth, which the lad thought a sum sufficient to secure his independence.\r\nAmong the passengers frequently crossing the ferry was Mr. Canvass White,\r\nU. S. Engineer, at that time superintending the construction of public\r\nworks in various parts of the country. Mr. White took a strong fancy to\r\nthe juvenile ferryman, and was so much impressed by the interest the boy\r\nmanifested in construction, that he applied to Stillman's father for\r\npermission to take the lad and educate him in his own profession. The\r\npermission was granted, and from that day dates the career of the future\r\nrailroad builder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, S. Witt]\r\n\r\nYoung Witt was greatly pleased with his new profession, and devoted\r\nhimself to it with such zeal and faithfulness that he grew rapidly in the\r\nesteem of his patron. When he had sufficiently progressed to be entrusted\r\nwith works of such importance, he was dispatched in different directions\r\nto construct bridges and canals as the agent of Mr. White. In this manner\r\nhe superintended the construction of the bridge at Cohoes Falls, on the\r\nMohawk river, four miles above Troy, where, in conjunction with Mr. White,\r\nhe laid out a town which has since grown to a population of thirty\r\nthousand. The side cut on the Erie canal, at Port Schuyler, was dug under\r\nhis management, and the docks there, since covered with factories, were\r\nbuilt by him. When these were completed he was dispatched into\r\nPennsylvania, with twenty-four carpenters, all his seniors, to build a\r\nState bridge at the mouth of the Juniata, from Duncan Island to Peter's\r\nMountain. He was then ordered to the work on the Louisville and Portland\r\ncanal, but before this was completed he was taken sick and remained a\r\nprisoner in a sick room at Albany for thirteen months.\r\n\r\nWith his recovery came a temporary change of occupation. Abandoning for a\r\ntime his work of bridge building and canal digging, he took charge of the\r\nsteamboat James Farley, the first lake-canal boat that towed through,\r\nwithout transhipment, to New York. This was followed by his taking charge,\r\nfor between two and three years, of Dr. Nott's steamboat Novelty. Next he\r\nbecame manager of the Hudson River Association line of boats, in which\r\ncapacity he remained during the existence of the association, ten years.\r\nThe Albany and Boston Railroad having been opened, Mr. Witt was invited to\r\nbecome its manager at Albany, and accepted the trust, remaining in that\r\nposition seven years and a half.\r\n\r\nNow came the most important epoch in Mr. Witt's life. After a hard\r\nstruggle the scheme for the construction of a railroad between Cleveland\r\nand Columbus assumed definite shape, a company was organized and was\r\nprepared to go to work when contractors should be found who would build\r\nthe road with a little money and a good deal of faith. Mr. Witt's\r\nopportunity had come. At the end of a four days' toilsome journey from\r\nBuffalo in a cab, he reached Cleveland, and satisfactory arrangements were\r\nfinally entered into. A firm was formed, under the name of Harbach, Stone\r\n& Witt, and the work commenced. The story of the building of the\r\nCleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad has already been told in\r\nanother part of this volume; it is a story of hoping almost against hope,\r\nof desperate struggles against opposition and indifference, and of final\r\ntriumph. Mr. Witt's part in the struggle was an important one, and the\r\nsolid benefit resulting from the success that crowned the enterprise was\r\nwell deserved by him.\r\n\r\nBefore the work of construction was half completed, Mr. Harbach died, and\r\nthe firm remained Stone & Witt, under which name it has become familiar to\r\nall parts of the American railroad world. The road was opened between\r\nCleveland and Columbus in 1851, and the success that speedily followed the\r\nopening, demonstrated the wisdom of the projectors of the line, and\r\njustified the faith of its contractors. The three years of construction\r\nhad not terminated before Messrs. Stone & Witt undertook the construction\r\nof the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad, and in two years\r\nthis road, now one of the richest and most powerful lines of the country,\r\nwas completed. This was followed, sometime after, by the building of the\r\nChicago and Milwaukee Railroad, which required but one year to construct,\r\nalthough built in the best manner.\r\n\r\nWith the completion of the Chicago and Milwaukee road Mr. Witt's active\r\ncareer as a railroad builder ceased. Since that time he has been chiefly\r\nemployed in the management of his extensive railroad and banking\r\ninterests, having been at different periods a director in the Michigan\r\nSouthern; Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati; Cleveland, Painesville and\r\nAshtabula; Cleveland and Pittsburgh; Chicago and Milwaukee, and\r\nBellefontaine and Indiana railroads, besides being vice-president of two\r\nof these roads and president of one of them. His connection with the\r\nBellefontaine and Indiana Railroad is noticeable from the fact that it was\r\nby his sagacity and unwearied energy, ably assisted by the late Governor\r\nBrough, as general manager, that the company was raised from absolute\r\ninsolvency to a high rank among dividend paying lines. Mr. Witt had gone\r\ninto the undertaking with a number of other Clevelanders, had all but lost\r\nhis entire investment, but had never lost faith in the ultimate success of\r\nthe line, or flagged for an instant in his efforts to bring about that\r\nsuccess. The event proved the justness of his conclusions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his railroad engagements, Mr. Witt is president of the Sun\r\nInsurance Company, of Cleveland; director of the Second National, and\r\nCommercial National Banks, and Cleveland Banking Company; also, of the\r\nBank of Toledo. His interests are not all centered in railroad and banking\r\nenterprises, he having investments in the Cleveland Chemical Works, and in\r\nseveral other enterprises that contribute to the prosperity of the city.\r\n\r\nMr. Witt was married in June, 1834, to Miss Eliza A. Douglass, of Albany,\r\nbut who was a native of Rhode Island. Of the four children who were the\r\nfruit of this marriage, but two survive. The elder daughter, Mary, is now\r\nthe wife of Mr. Dan P. Eells, of Cleveland. The younger, Emma, is the wife\r\nof Col. W. H. Harris, of the United States Army, now in command of the\r\narsenal at Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nMr. Witt's qualifications as a business man are attested by his success,\r\nwon not by a mere stroke of luck, but by far-seeing sagacity, quick\r\ndecision, and untiring industry. From first to last he never encountered a\r\nfailure, not because fortune chanced always to be on his side, but because\r\nshrewdness and forethought enabled him to provide against misfortune. As a\r\ncitizen he has always pursued a liberal and enlightened policy, ever ready\r\nto unite in whatever promised to be for the public good. In social life he\r\nhas a wide circle of attached friends, and not a single enemy. Genial,\r\nunselfish, deeply attached to his family, and with a warm side for\r\nhumanity in general, Mr. Witt has made for himself more friends than\r\nperhaps he himself is aware of.\r\n\r\nWealth and position have enabled him to do numerous acts of kindness, and\r\nhis disposition has prompted him to perform those acts without ostentation\r\nand with a gracefulness that gave twofold value to the act.\r\n\r\nIn religious belief Mr. Witt is a Baptist, having joined with that church\r\norganization in Albany, thirty-one years ago. For years he has been a\r\nvaluable and highly respected member of the First Baptist Church in\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough James Farmer has been a resident of Cleveland but thirteen years,\r\nand cannot, therefore, be ranked among the old settlers of the city, he is\r\nlooked upon as one of its most respected citizens, whose word is as good\r\nas a secured bond, and whose sound judgment and stability of character\r\nplace him among the most valuable class of business men. But though\r\nprudent in business affairs, and of deeply earnest character in all\r\nrelations of life, Mr. Farmer has not allowed the stern realities of life\r\nto obscure the lighter qualities that serve to make life endurable. Always\r\ncheerful in manner and genial in disposition, with a quaint appreciation\r\nof the humorous side of things, he endeavors to round off the sharp\r\ncorners of practical life with a pleasant and genial smile. A meditative\r\nfaculty of mind, untrammeled by the opinions or dicta of others, has led\r\nMr. Farmer into independent paths of thought and action, in all his\r\naffairs. Before taking any course, he has thought it out for himself, and\r\ndecided on his action, in accordance with his conscientious convictions of\r\nright, independent of considerations of mere worldly notice.\r\n\r\nMr. Farmer was born near Augusta, Georgia, July 19th, 1802. His early\r\nopportunities for acquiring an education were scant, only such knowledge\r\nbeing gained as could be picked up in a common school, where the\r\nrudiments of an education only are taught. Until his twenty-first year,\r\nhis time was chiefly spent on his father's farm, but on attaining his\r\nmajority he concluded to strike out a different path for himself, and\r\ncoming north, he engages in the manufacture of salt, and in the milling\r\nbusiness, at Salineville, Ohio. His means were small, but by assiduous\r\nattention to business he was moderately successful. Four years later he\r\nadded a store for general marchandise to his mill and salt works, and\r\nthus added to his property.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1847, Mr. Farmer, imbued with the spirit of progress, and\r\nappreciating in advance the benefits to accrue from the proposed Cleveland\r\nand Pittsburgh Railroad, entered with spirit into the enterprise, worked\r\nhard in procuring subscriptions to the stock, and aided in various ways to\r\nits consummation. For several years he held the position of president of\r\nthe company, and it was through his labors in this channel of commerce,\r\nthat he became so thoroughly identified with the progress and prosperity\r\nof Cleveland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Respectfully, James Farmer]\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the railroad, Mr. Farmer was among the first to\r\navail himself of the increased facilities for business offered by the\r\nroad, and embarked in the coal trade, having previously owned coal fields\r\nin Salineville. These coal fields were now worked, and the product shipped\r\nby railroad to Cleveland and other points.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1856, he removed to Cleveland, abandoning the mercantile\r\nbusiness after devoting to it thirty-two years of his life, and having\r\nbeen completely successful. His coal fields still continue to furnish\r\nsupplies to the coal market of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nSo far as human power can be said to control human affairs, Mr. Farmer has\r\nbeen wholly the architect of his own fortunes. The prosperity that has\r\nattended his efforts has been due to the close attention given his\r\nlegitimate business, his strictness in making and keeping contracts, his\r\nprudent economy, and his nice sense of commercial honor and general\r\nhonesty. What man can do to make honest success, he has endeavored to do,\r\nand Providence has smiled upon his efforts.\r\n\r\nMr Farmer is still a hale appearing gentleman, though sixty-seven years\r\nold, retaining most of his mental vigor, and much of his physical stamina,\r\nand will, we trust, be permitted to remain among us for years to come,\r\nthat he may enjoy the fruits of his labor, and have the satisfaction felt\r\nby those only who minister to the necessities of others.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, Mr. Farmer was married to Miss Meribah Butler, of Columbiana\r\ncounty, Ohio, by whom he has had seven children, of whom five still\r\nlive--one son and four daughters. The son, Mr. E. J. Farmer, has been for\r\nsome years engaged in the banking business in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nThe father of Mr. James Farmer joined the Society of Friends, and was an\r\nhonored member of that society. His family were all brought up in the same\r\nfaith, and Mr. James Farmer has maintained his connection with the\r\nsociety, by the members of which he is held in high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Ely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge B. Ely is a native of Jefferson county, New York, a county which\r\nhas contributed many good citizens to the population of Cleveland. He was\r\nborn in the town of Adams, June 23d, 1817, received a good academical\r\neducation, and when seventeen left the academy to become clerk with Judge\r\nFoster, under whose auspices he came to Cleveland. After serving with\r\nJudge Foster one year in Cleveland, he accepted the position of\r\nbook-keeper in the forwarding house of Pease & Allen, on the river,\r\nremaining in this position until 1843. At that date he removed to Milan,\r\nErie county, then at the head of slackwater navigation on the Huron river.\r\nHere he engaged in trading in wheat, and in the general forwarding\r\nbusiness, and also became interested in lake shipping, doing business\r\nunder the firm name of Wilber & Ely.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, the railroad between Columbus and Cleveland was completed, and\r\nthe course of trade was almost entirely diverted from its old channels.\r\nThe business of Milan fell away rapidly, and the forwarding trade at that\r\npoint was completely at an end, Mr. Ely closed up his connection with the\r\nplace in the Spring of 1852, and removed to Cleveland, where he had\r\nengaged a warehouse with the intention of continuing in the forwarding\r\nbusiness, but was induced to take the secretaryship of the Cleveland,\r\nPainesville and Ashtabula Railroad, many of his old business and personal\r\nfriends having become interested in that undertaking and desiring the\r\nbenefit of his business tact and experience. About a year after his\r\naccession to the company, the offices of secretary and treasurer were\r\ncombined, and Mr. Ely assumed charge of the joint offices. Three years\r\nlater he was elected a director of the company and has continued in that\r\nposition to the present time. At various times he has been chosen\r\nvice-president of the company. In 1868, he was elected president of the\r\nCleveland and Toledo Railroad Company, retaining that position until the\r\nconsolidation of the company with the Cleveland and Erie Railroad Company,\r\nand the formation of the Lake Shore Railroad Company. Mr. Ely is now the\r\noldest officer in point of service in the Consolidated company, and is\r\nabout the oldest employee. During all his long service he has been an\r\nindefatigable worker, having the interests of the line always at heart,\r\nand his arduous and faithful services have contributed their full share to\r\nthe prosperity of the company.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Respectfully, Geo. B. Ely]\r\n\r\nWhilst always watchful for the interests of the road with which he was\r\nconnected, Mr. Ely found time to engage in other enterprises tending to\r\nadvance the material interests of the city. In connection with Messrs.\r\nR. H. Harman, A. M. Harman, and L. M. Coe, he projected and built the\r\nCleveland City Forge and put it into successful operation in the year 1864.\r\nThis forge has now four large hammers at work, and preparations are making\r\nfor two others, and it gives employment to about eighty skilled workmen.\r\nHe was one of the projectors of the Pennsylvania Coal Company, of\r\nCleveland, an organization having five thousand acres of coal lands in\r\nMercer county, Pennsylvania, and now that the Jamestown and Franklin\r\nRailroad is completed, the prospects of ample returns for the outlay are\r\ngood. Sixty tons of good coal are daily delivered in Cleveland, whilst the\r\nbest markets of the product are found in Erie, Buffalo, and the\r\nPennsylvania oil regions. Of this company Mr. Ely is treasurer and one of\r\nits directors.\r\n\r\nAmong his other business connections he was a director in the old Bank of\r\nCommerce from its early days until it was reorganized as the Second\r\nNational Bank, and is still a director under the new organization. He is\r\nalso a director in the Citizens Savings and Loan Association, and is\r\ninterested in the Cleveland Banking Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Ely has been the architect of his own fortune, and attributes his\r\nsuccess in life to close application to business and a firm determination\r\nnever to live beyond his income. He is now fifty-two years old, enjoys\r\nvigorous health, and has never been seriously sick. From present\r\nappearances he has a fair prospect of a long life in which to enjoy the\r\nfruits of his labors, and to pass the afternoon and evening of his life\r\namid domestic comforts earned by industry and the esteem of a large circle\r\nof friends to whom he has become endeared by his many social qualities and\r\npersonal virtues.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, he was married to Miss Gertrude S. Harman, of Brooklyn, Michigan,\r\nand formerly of Oswego, New York. They have one son, now twenty-five years\r\nold, who has charge of the Cleveland City Forge, and one daughter, Helen,\r\naged seventeen, who is now at school.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorthy S. Streator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Streator, as he is still called, although for many years he has\r\nabandoned the active practice of medicine, was born in Madison county, New\r\nYork, October 16th, 1816. He received an academical education, and at the\r\nage of eighteen he entered a medical college, where he remained four\r\nyears. On completing his medical course he went to Aurora, Portage county,\r\nOhio, where he commenced the practice of his profession, in the year 1839\r\nIn Aurora he remained rive years, when he removed to Louisville, Kentucky,\r\nspent a year in the medical college there, and returned to Portage county,\r\nresuming his practice in Ravenna.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Dr. Streator removed from Ravenna to Cleveland, and after\r\nremaining two years in the practice of medicine, turned his attention to\r\nrailroad building. In conjunction with Mr. Henry Doolittle, he undertook\r\nthe contract for building the Greenville and Medina Railroad, and\r\ncompleted it successfully. In 1853, the same parties contracted for the\r\nconstruction of the Atlantic and Great Western Railway in Ohio, a work of\r\n244 miles. Operations were at once commenced, and were pushed forward with\r\nvarying success, funds of the company coming in fitfully. In 1860, the\r\nsame firm took contracts for the construction of the Pennsylvania portion\r\nof the line, ninety-one miles, and next for the New York portion. Work on\r\nboth these contracts was commenced in February, 1860, and the road was\r\ncompleted from Salamanca, in New York, to Corry, in Pennsylvania,\r\nsixty-one miles, in the Spring of 1861.\r\n\r\nDuring the prosecution of the work Mr. Doolittle died, and, in 1861,\r\nDr. Streator sold the unfinished contracts to Mr. James McHenry, of\r\nLondon, England, by whom they were completed, Dr. Streator acting as\r\nsuperintendent of construction for about a year after the transfer\r\nof contract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, W. S. Streator]\r\n\r\nIn 1862, he projected the Oil Creek Railroad, from Corry to Petroleum\r\nCenter, the heart of the Pennsylvania oil regions, a line thirty-seven\r\nmiles long. The line was built with extraordinary rapidity, and achieved a\r\nsuccess unparalleled in railway history. No sooner had the rails reached a\r\npoint within striking distance of Oil Creek than its cars were crowded\r\nwith passengers flocking to the \"oildorado,\" and for many months, during\r\nthe height of the oil fever, the excited crowds struggled at the stations\r\nfor the privilege of a standing place on the car platforms after the seats\r\nand aisles were filled. The resources of the road were inadequate to meet\r\nthe great demand on it for the transportation of passengers and oil, and\r\nalthough Dr. Streator worked energetically to keep pace with the demand\r\nupon the road, the development of the oil regions, consequent upon the\r\nconstruction of the line, for some time outstripped him. The profits of\r\nthe line were enormous in proportion to the outlay, but the amount of\r\nwealth it created in the oil regions was still more extraordinary. Dr.\r\nStreator managed the road until 1866, when he sold out his interest to\r\nDean Richmond and others interested in the New York Central Railroad. In\r\norder to connect the Oil Creek Railroad with the line of its purchasers an\r\nextension northward, styled the Cross-Cut Railroad, was built from Corry\r\nto Brocton, on the Buffalo and Erie Railroad, a distance of forty-two\r\nmiles, by Dr. Streator, for the New York Central Railroad Company. This\r\nwas the last of Dr. Streator's railroad building undertakings.\r\n\r\nSince the close of his railroad business Dr. Streator has organized a\r\ncompany, mainly composed of citizens of Cleveland, for the working of coal\r\nlands purchased in La Salle, on the Vermillion river, Illinois. The\r\npurchase contains three thousand acres on which is a five and one-half\r\nfeet splint-vein of coal resembling in general characteristics the\r\nMassillon coal of Ohio. Thirteen miles of railroad have been built to\r\nconnect the mines with the Illinois Central Railroad, and during the year\r\nthat the road has been opened the average product of the mines has been\r\ntwo hundred and fifty tons per day, with demands for more, that cannot be\r\nmet owing to a deficiency of rolling stock. By the close of 1869, it is\r\nexpected the product will reach a thousand tons daily. Another railroad is\r\nto be built to connect with the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad.\r\n\r\nAside from his interest in this coal company, Dr. Streator has now no\r\nactive business engagements, and devotes his time to the care of his real\r\nestate and a fine stock farm in East Cleveland, containing over three\r\nhundred acres, on which he is raising some of the finest stock to be found\r\nin the county.\r\n\r\nDr. Streator has had the good sense to retire from the pressing cares of\r\nbusiness whilst able to enjoy the fruits of his labors. At fifty-three\r\nyears old he is healthy and vigorous, and fully able to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of wealth in procuring social and domestic enjoyments. His\r\nresidence on Euclid avenue is a model of comfort and elegance, and the\r\nsurrounding grounds are laid out with artistic taste.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1839, to Sarah W. Sterling, of Lyman, N. Y. His only\r\ndaughter is the wife of E. B. Thomas, Esq., of Cleveland; his oldest son\r\ndevotes his attention to the care of the stock farm; the other sons are\r\nyet at home, being young.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Streator has been regarded, for years, as one of our most\r\nactive and energetic business men, he has found time to devote to his\r\nreligious duties. He has for a long time been a useful member of the\r\nDisciple Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Coal Interest\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the commencement of the season of 1828, the Ohio canal had been opened\r\nfrom Cleveland to Akron. Henry Newberry, father of Professer Newberry, who\r\namong his other possessions on the Western Reserve, owned some valuable\r\ncoal lands, saw, or fancied he saw, an opening for an important trade in\r\ncoal, and sent a shipment of a few tons to Cleveland by way of experiment.\r\nOn its arrival a portion of it was loaded in a wagon and hawked around the\r\ncity, the attention of leading citizens being called to its excellent\r\nquality and its great value as fuel. But the people were deaf to the voice\r\nof the charmer. They looked askance at the coal and urged against it all\r\nthe objections which careful housewives, accustomed to wood fires, even\r\nnow offer against its use for culinary purposes. It was dirty, nasty,\r\ninconvenient to handle, made an offensive smoke, and not a few shook their\r\nheads incredulously at the idea of making the \"stone\" burn at all. Wood\r\nwas plentiful and cheap, and as long as that was the case they did not see\r\nthe use of going long distances to procure a doubtful article of fuel,\r\nneither as clean, convenient, nor cheap as hickory or maple. By nightfall\r\nthe wagon had unsuccessfully traversed the streets and found not a single\r\npurchaser for its contents. Here and there a citizen had accepted a little\r\nas a gift, with a doubtful promise to test its combustible qualities.\r\nEventually, Philo Scovill was persuaded into the purchase of a moderate\r\nquantity at two dollars per ton, and promised to put in grates at the\r\nFranklin House to properly test its qualities.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of a trade which has since grown to mammoth\r\nproportions, and which has become the foundation of the prosperity of\r\nCleveland, for it is to the proximity and practically inexhaustibleness of\r\nits coal supply that Cleveland owes its manufacturing character, which is\r\nthe secret of its rapid development within a few years, its present\r\nprosperity, and the assured greatness of its future.\r\n\r\nAs a domestic fuel coal made slow progress in the city for many years, but\r\nother uses were found for it, and the receipts of coal by canal rapidly\r\nincreased. Steamboats multiplied on the lakes, and these found the coal of\r\nCleveland a valuable fuel. By degrees manufacturing was ventured on, in a\r\nsmall way, and there being no water-power of consequence, recourse was had\r\nto steam, which created a moderate demand for coal. For ten years the\r\nreceipts increased steadily, until in 1838, it reached 2,496 tons. In\r\n1848, it had grown to 66,551 tons, and in 1858--the canal transportation\r\nbeing supplemented by two lines of railroad crossing the coal fields on\r\nthe way to Cleveland--to 222,267 tons. In 1868, it had swollen to 759,104\r\ntons, and the demand continues to increase in a rate more than\r\nproportionate to the enlarged sources of supply and increased facilities\r\nfor transportation.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Cleveland and Mahoning Railroad gave a strong stimulus\r\nto the coal trade of northern Ohio, and was one of the most important\r\nevents in the history of Cleveland. By this time the beds of the valuable\r\nBriar Hill, or block coal, were tapped, which has proved the best fuel for\r\nmanufacturing iron from the raw ore, and has no superior, if it has a\r\nrival, in the West. With the discovery of this bed of coal, blast furnaces\r\nand rolling mills were established in the Mahoning Valley, and as the uses\r\nof the coal became known in Cleveland and in other ports, a large demand,\r\nfor consumption in the city and exports to other points, sprang up. Over\r\none-half the amount of Ohio coal raised is of the Briar Hill grade, and of\r\nthe whole amount of Ohio coal raised, about one-half finds its market in\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nThe bituminous coal is of several grades, each suitable for a particular\r\npurpose. The most important is the Briar Hill grade, mined in the southern\r\nhalf of Trumbull county and finding its outlet by the Cleveland and\r\nMahoning Railroad. This is a good grate coal, but its great use is in the\r\nmanufacture of iron, and the numerous furnaces of the Mahoning Valley, the\r\niron manufactories of Cleveland, and the demand along the line of the\r\nlakes, keep the numerous mines in full operation. The Mineral Ridge grade\r\nis a comparatively new quality to Cleveland, and has yet but comparatively\r\nfew mines. It is used both for domestic and manufacturing purposes. The\r\nMassillon grade is brought both by canal and railroad, and is highly\r\nesteemed as a grate coal. The rapidly growing demand for grate fuel has\r\ngiven a great stimulus to the mining of this coal within a few years. The\r\nHammondsville and Salineville grades are used chiefly for stoves in\r\ndomestic use, for steam purposes, and for the manufacture of gas. These\r\ngrades come to market on the Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad. The\r\nBlossburgh grade is used almost entirely for blacksmithing.\r\n\r\nBesides the Ohio bituminous coals there is a steadily increasing demand\r\nfor the anthracite and semi-anthracite coals of eastern Pennsylvania,\r\nwhich is brought by lake from Buffalo.\r\n\r\nThe growth of the coal trade during the past four years can be seen by the\r\nfollowing table, showing the receipts from all sources and shipments,\r\nchiefly by lake, coastwise and to Canadian ports:\r\n\r\n  Date.      Receipts.

Of the shipments of each during the year, 382,928\r\ntons went by lake, and about 10,000 tons by rail, mostly by Cleveland and\r\nToledo Railroad to Toledo and intermediate points.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Philpot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough never a resident of Cleveland, the enterprise of William Philpot\r\nso directly contributed to the prosperity of the city, the labors of his\r\nlife were so connected with it, and the interests he founded have since\r\nbecome such an integral part of the business of Cleveland, that his\r\nmemoir appropriately finds a place in this work. It is proper, too, that\r\nit should stand foremost in the department relating to the coal trade of\r\nthe city, for he may justly be considered one of the leading founders of\r\nthat trade.\r\n\r\nWilliam Philpot was born in Shropshire, England. At an early age he\r\nremoved to Wales and went to work in the mines at three pence per day.\r\nSoon after he was able to earn full wages, he became an overseer, and\r\ncontinued in that capacity until he took contracts on his own account. His\r\nsuccess was varied, on some he made handsomely, on others he failed. By\r\nthe year 1835, he accumulated about eight thousand dollars, and concluded\r\nto go to the United States as affording greater facilities for small\r\ncapitalists. He proceeded to Pittsburgh, where he immediately interested\r\nhimself in the mining of coal. He commenced by leasing from one party a\r\nportion of the coal and the right of way on a large tract of coal land,\r\nfor a term of twenty-one years, and leased coal from others, at a quarter\r\ncent per bushel. Of another person he purchased a farm, bearing coal, at\r\nseventy-five dollars an acre. In the Summer of 1837, he took into\r\npartnership Mr. Snowden, and the firm set to work vigorously, mining coal\r\nat Saw Mill Run and shipping on the Ohio river, to which Mr. Philpot had\r\nbuilt a railway a mile in length. The two partners were not well matched.\r\nMr. Philpot was full of energy, fertile in resources, and never slackened\r\nin his endeavors to push his affairs. No difficulties daunted him; the\r\ngreater the obstacles the more pleasure he took in surmounting them. He\r\nbuilt his railroad tracks where most other men would have shrunk from\r\nplacing a rail and whilst those who commenced preparations for a mine at\r\nthe same time with himself were still in the preparatory stages of work,\r\nhis cars would be rattling down to the river loaded with coal. One great\r\nsecret of his ability to hasten matters was his influence with the men\r\nunder him. He was familiar and affable with them, worked energetically\r\namong them whenever a sharp effort was needed, and in this way got more\r\nwork out of the men, without their feeling that they had been imposed\r\nupon, than most employers could have done. Mr. Snowden was a man of an\r\nentirely different stamp, and it soon became evident that the firm must\r\ndissolve. After some negotiations Mr. Philpot disposed of his interests to\r\nMessrs. Snowden and Lewis, and in 1838, removed to Paris, Portage county,\r\nOhio, where he had purchased a farm. His family at that time consisted of\r\nhis wife and two daughters; Mary Ann, now the wife of R. J. Price, Esq.,\r\nDorothy, now widow of the late David Morris, Esq. With them also was his\r\nfather, Samuel Philpot, now dead. Soon after his removal to Portage county\r\nhe became interested with Mr. Philip Price, in the excavation of the\r\nPennsylvania and Ohio canal, and during the progress of the work they\r\npurchased land on either side of the canal, including Lock fourteen, where\r\nthey built a saw and flouring mill, using the canal water as motive power.\r\nTowards the latter part of 1839, Mr. Philpot purchased the interest of Mr.\r\nPrice in the mills and land, and ran the mills successfully, until 1841,\r\nwhen he sold both mills and land to Colonel Elisha Garrett, of\r\nGarrettsville. In the Spring of 1841, Mr. Philpot rented his home farm and\r\nremoved with his family to Middlebury, Summit county, where he had\r\npurchased a coal bank, and engaged once more in the coal trade.\r\n\r\nThe importance of his operations in coal, both to the business of the coal\r\nregions and of Cleveland, which formed his principal market, can scarcely\r\nbe overestimated. Before removing to Springfield he discovered there, in\r\n1840, a valuable coal mine, which he afterwards developed and worked\r\nsuccessfully, building a railroad of about three miles from the mines to\r\nthe canal at Middlebury, whence the coal was shipped to Cleveland. This\r\nroad he stocked with about forty coal cars, and for several years his mine\r\nsupplied the principal demand for the Cleveland market. In 1843, he\r\ndeveloped and improved the celebrated Chippewa mines, Wayne county, near\r\nthe village of Clinton, and built a railroad to the Ohio canal. From these\r\nmines he supplied the Cleveland market with large quantities of coal until\r\nthe year 1845, when he sold out half his interests in them to Mr. Lemuel\r\nCrawford, and some time afterward he sold one-quarter interest to Mr.\r\nDavid Camp.\r\n\r\nHis next remove was to Youngstown, where, in 1846, he leased the Manning\r\nand Wertz bank, and while sinking for coal, discovered iron ore. He then\r\nwent to Pittsburgh and endeavored to get up a furnace company, but not\r\nbeing successful, he returned, and associated himself with Jonathan\r\nWarner and a few others in organizing the Ohio Iron and Mining Company,\r\nnow known as the Eagle Furnace Company, Messrs. Philpot and Warner owning\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire stock. Mr. Philpot at that time opened and\r\ndeveloped the Wertz and Manning Briar Hill coal mines, the furnace having\r\nbeen built with the purpose of smelting iron ore with raw stone coal,\r\nbeing the second constructed for this purpose in the Mahoning Valley, the\r\nfirst being that of Wilkenson, Wilks & Co., at Lowellville. The\r\nexperiment was hazardous, and was carried forward under many difficulties,\r\nfinancial and otherwise, but the energy and enterprise of Mr. Philpot\r\ntriumphed over them all.\r\n\r\nMr. Philpot was a man of rare energy, industry and practical good sense.\r\nHe was always successful for he seemed to have an intuitive knowledge of\r\nwhat was the right course to take, and when once entered on an enterprise\r\nnever allowed himself to be defeated or discouraged. His integrity was\r\nunquestioned. His word was as good as a bond, and was entirely relied on.\r\nHe was a kind husband and father, a true friend, and his heart and hand\r\nwere always open to the poor and distressed, many of whom were not only\r\nrelieved from their pressing emergencies, but were assisted to start in\r\nbusiness or to procure homesteads. Besides his many excellent social\r\nqualities and business talents, he was possessed of a most extraordinary\r\nmemory, and it is related of him by one who knew him intimately, that\r\nafter hearing a speech or sermon that enlisted his whole attention, he\r\nwould sometimes rehearse it to others almost verbatim.\r\n\r\nMr. Philpot died in Liberty township, Trumbull county, June 2d, 1851.\r\n\r\nIn all the great enterprises of his business career, Mr. Philpot was ably\r\nsupported by his beloved partner in life, who was a woman of more than\r\nordinary ability. She was also most remarkably benevolent, bestowing much\r\ncare on the sick and indigent in her immediate neighborhood. She survived\r\nher husband a number of years, and died at Cleveland, in August, 1865,\r\ndeeply lamented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lemuel Crawford]\r\n\r\n\r\nLemuel Crawford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch belonged to the business classes, as\r\ndistinguished from the professional, but which are none the less fruitful\r\nin characters of prominence and public interest.\r\n\r\nIndeed it has come to pass in later years that what are commonly known as\r\nthe learned professions, law, medicine and theology, though still high in\r\nrank, have lost something of the ruling pre-eminence they occupied in our\r\nearlier history. Other departments in the world's industry have asserted\r\nthemselves, and railway systems, telegraphs, commerce, journalism,\r\nmanufactures, banking, and other branches, have come forward and absorbed\r\ntheir fair proportion of the best talent and ambition of the country.\r\n\r\nLemuel Crawford was born in Florida, Schoharie county, New York,\r\nDecember 15, 1805.\r\n\r\nLeft without means, at the age of fourteen he chose the trade of moulder\r\nin the iron or furnace business.\r\n\r\nAt twenty-one he came to Painesville, Ohio, where he was made foreman of\r\nthe Geauga Furnace. Here he remained about six years, having especial\r\nsuperintendence of the pattern and moulding department, and filling his\r\nposition with great skill and credit. At this place, July 29, 1832, he\r\nmarried Louisa Murray, of Willoughby, in the same county, who still\r\nsurvives him, and to whose long and faithful companionship, judgment and\r\nenergy, in all the vicissitudes of his fortune, he was largely indebted\r\nfor his success.\r\n\r\nIn 1833, Mr. Crawford moved with his family to Detroit, whence, after\r\nremaining six years, he removed to Presque Isle on Lake Huron, where he\r\nwas the first to start the wood trade, for fuel for our then rapidly\r\ngrowing steamboat commerce. Here he remained seven years, superintending\r\nlarge bodies of wood cutters and suppliers, the saw mills, now so common\r\nin the lumber region, being then unknown.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, perceiving, with his usual forecast, that coal was likely to\r\nsupplant wood for the uses of our steam marine, he removed to Cleveland,\r\nand at once invested about forty thousand dollars in the Chippewa mines,\r\nso called, in the Mahoning Valley, which had been opened a year or two\r\nbefore, and promised, as the event proved, to afford an almost\r\ninexhaustible supply of the richest coal. These mines, adding tracts of\r\nadjoining coal land to them as occasion demanded, he continued to work\r\nwith a large annual yield for more then twenty years.\r\n\r\nShortly after commencing with the Chippewa, he was found, in 1848, to be\r\namong the pioneers in opening up the beds of Briar Hill coal in the\r\nMahoning Valley, so well known to steamboat men and manufacturers ever\r\nsince, as being a kind of coal peculiarly fitted for their uses. Here he\r\ncontinued to mine largely at several different localities selected by him\r\nwith rare judgment. He also opened and carried on mining extensively at\r\nother points, such as on the Ohio, below Steubenville, also in Orange\r\ncounty, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHis chief business office and coal depots were at Cleveland, but he had\r\nbranch establishments at Detroit and Chicago, and at one time was largely\r\ninterested in vessel property on the Lakes, and although the business of\r\nmining and selling coal, mainly for supplying steam craft and for\r\nexportation, was his leading pursuit, he was one of the earliest in 1851,\r\nto engage in the manufacture of pig iron from our native ores in the\r\nMahoning Valley, having an interest in the second furnace started there,\r\nand being the builder of the fourth. From time to time he invested\r\njudiciously in real estate.\r\n\r\nFrom all these sources in spite of some business adventures which\r\nproved disastrous, through unexpected financial revulsions, or the\r\nfault of others, he succeeded in amassing a splendid fortune to be\r\ninherited by his family. He was never a speculator, nor a rash\r\noperator, but his business views were liberal and comprehensive, and\r\ncarried out with energy and wisdom. Personally he was a man of fine\r\npresence and manners, always pleasant to meet with on the street,\r\ncordial and unassuming. He was intensely loyal and liberal throughout\r\nthe war, and always kind and charitable to the poor. He was not a\r\nchurch member, but was a regular church attendant and a respecter of\r\nreligions institutions. In his later years he was frequently an\r\ninvalid, and being in New York in the Fall of 1867, by the advice of\r\nphysicians, and in company with friends from Cleveland, he sailed for\r\nEurope, where, in Paris, during the Exposition, he spent some months,\r\nreturning with health improved, but which again declined until June\r\n30, 1868, when at the age of sixty-two years, six months and fifteen\r\ndays, he died at his beautiful home in Cleveland, surrounded by his\r\nfamily and friends, peacefully and calmly, as a good man dies.\r\n\r\nWe feel that we can not do better than to conclude this brief and\r\nimperfect sketch with the notice which appeared in the Cleveland Herald on\r\nthe evening of the day of his decease. Speaking of the event it says:\r\n\r\n  We regret to announce the decease of this prominent business man and\r\n  respected citizen, who died at his residence on Euclid avenue this\r\n  (Tuesday) morning at about 9 o'clock.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Crawford had for years been more or less an invalid, but had not\r\n  been alarmingly ill until last Thursday, when by a sudden and severe\r\n  attack he was completely prostrated, and recovery became hopeless.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Crawford had nearly reached the age of sixty-three. A native of New\r\n  York, beginning life with few, if any, adventitous aids, he had attained\r\n  to affluence and position by a long and enterprising business career.\r\n  For the last twenty-four years he has lived in Cleveland. He was among\r\n  the pioneers in the coal mining business of Northern Ohio, contributing\r\n  largely ever since by his sagacity and experience, to the development of\r\n  that important element of commerce and public wealth.\r\n\r\n  Through all the vicissitudes of a long business life he maintained a\r\n  character of the most perfect integrity. As a citizen he was liberal and\r\n  public spirited; as a neighbor and friend he was kind and generous; in\r\n  his social and domestic relations he was simple and unostentatious,\r\n  affectionate and beloved. Very many in the various ranks and conditions\r\n  of life, both here and elsewhere, will mourn his loss, and remember him\r\n  with sincere respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. P. Rhodes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of D. P. Rhodes is distinguished among those who have\r\ncontributed to the prosperity of Cleveland by the development of its coal\r\nand iron interests. For many years he has labored to build up the coal\r\nand iron trade of the city, on which its future mainly depends, and has\r\nmet with a success which has benefitted the public in a far greater\r\ndegree than it has enriched himself, although he has had nothing to\r\ncomplain of in that respect.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes was born in Sudbury, Rutland county, Vermont. His father dying\r\nwhen the boy was but five years old, he was compelled to work for his own\r\nliving, riding horse for his neighbors whilst they plowed corn, digging\r\npotatoes and picking apples for every tenth bushel, and doing other odd\r\njobs. When he was fifteen years old his mother married again and he lived\r\nwith his stepfather till twenty-one. His stepfather, being rich, offered\r\nhim a farm if he would stay with him, but he was bent on seeing the West\r\nbefore accepting the farm, and so set out westward. Whilst in the West he\r\nbecame engaged to be married, and before marriage he visited his home,\r\nwhen his stepfather offered him half his property if he would return there\r\nand live. The papers were made out but were not to be executed till he had\r\nconsulted his affianced. To do this he returned to the West. As he\r\ntraveled by canal he had abundant time to consider the matter, and the\r\nmore he thought of it the more he became sick of the idea. Things were too\r\ncircumscribed down east to suit his taste. He said nothing of the matter\r\nto his affianced, but wrote home that he was not coming; and to this day\r\nhe has never seen occasion to regret his decision, but has been confirmed\r\nin its wisdom. To use his own expression: \"By Jupiter, I would rather live\r\nwest, if I did'nt live half as long.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes became early interested in the coal business, his first\r\nenterprise being in company with Messrs. Tod and Ford, in 1845, at the old\r\nBriar Hill mines, from which they raised and shipped by canal about fifty\r\ntons per week. This was considered a good business. In two or three years\r\nbusiness increased to a hundred tons daily. In 1846, another mine was\r\nopened in Girard. This was followed by the Clover Hill mine in the\r\nTuscarawas Valley, previous to the opening of which the firm was changed\r\nby the death of Mr. Ford. The next opened was the Clinton mines in the\r\nTuscarawas Valley. Then a mine in Fairview, Wayne county, which was the\r\nlast large transaction with Gov. Tod as partner. In about 1855, Tod and\r\nRhodes dissolved partnership, Mr. Rhodes taking Clover Hill, and Gov. Tod\r\nall the rest of the interests.\r\n\r\nWhilst developing his coal interests, Mr. Rhodes made important\r\ndiscoveries of iron ore, the first being veins of black band ore, very\r\nsimilar to the English and Scotch, though richer. The veins of this ore in\r\nTuscarawas are from five to fifteen feet thick. He also discovered and\r\nworked a vein of mountain ore that will also run from five to fifteen feet\r\nthick, and is easily mined, one miner being able to mine twenty tons per\r\nday after the earth has been removed. Mr. Rhodes spent several months in\r\nthe ore fields of Scotland and England in 1868, and found the veins there\r\nnot over two feet in thickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, D. P. Rhodes]\r\n\r\nIn the Tuscarawas Valley property, Mr. Rhodes has found seven veins of\r\ncoal, five of which are very good, and he has worked the whole of them.\r\nThere is also as good fire-clay as any yet discovered, the finest grade\r\nbeing pure sandstone, which stands fire as hearthstones in furnaces better\r\nthan any other. Shell ore, block ore, and limestone also exist in\r\nabundance. The iron enterprises in which Mr. Rhodes is interested are the\r\nTuscarawas Iron Company, formed about 1864, of which Mr. Rhodes is\r\npresident. This company have three or four thousand acres of mineral land\r\nin the Tuscarawas Valley, and the works have a capacity of a hundred and\r\nfifty tons per week; also the Dover Rolling Mill Company, of which Mr.\r\nBaker is president. It makes all sizes of merchant and small T rail iron,\r\nhaving a capacity of about fifteen tons per day.\r\n\r\nHe is largely interested in a mining company near Massillon, having three\r\nengines and three openings there, and can mine a thousand tons of coal per\r\nday as soon as the road from Massillon to Clinton is completed. This will\r\nbe the shortest coal bearing road,--for blast furnace coal--to Cleveland,\r\nby fifteen miles, for it connects with the Cleveland, Zanesville and\r\nCincinnati Railroad at Clinton, thence to Cleveland by Cleveland and\r\nPittsburgh Railroad at Hudson. A company was formed and sunk some eight\r\nhundred or nine hundred feet, within three miles of Canal Dover, on the\r\nline of this company, and found salt water of the very best quality, the\r\nwater itself being almost strong enough to preserve meat. There is coal\r\nwithin twenty rods of the wells at ninety cents per ton, whereas in\r\nSyracuse and Saginaw they have to use wood, at a cost (at the former\r\nplace) of seven dollars per cord. Mr. Cass, President of the Fort Wayne\r\nRailroad, and J. N. McCullough, of the same and of the Cleveland and\r\nPittsburgh Railroad, are heavily interested in the road connections\r\nadverted to above.\r\n\r\nAt Fulton, three miles below Clinton, is another coal company in which Mr.\r\nRhodes is interested. This mine yields about three hundred tons per day,\r\nand could double that amount if there were sufficient transportation.\r\nThere are two engines and two openings at this bank.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes is also interested in three mines at Marseilles, Willmington\r\nand Braceville, Illinois. He has taken a hearty interest in all\r\nimprovements, and especially in the matter of railroads. He was interested\r\nin building the Northern Division of the Cleveland and Toledo Railroad,\r\nand was on the executive committee.\r\n\r\nD. P. Rhodes and H. S. Stevens built the West Side street railroad, and\r\nequipped it. He was also largely interested in building and equipping the\r\nRocky River railroad. He is also interested in the Cleveland and\r\nZanesville railroad project.\r\n\r\nDr. Upson, of Talmadge, and Messrs. Philpot and Camp were in the coal\r\nbusiness when Mr. Rhodes commenced, and they have all disappeared. They\r\nonly then received about one boat load of fifty tons per week by canal,\r\nwhereas, the firm of Rhodes & Co. now handle from ninety thousand to one\r\nhundred thousand tons per year.\r\n\r\nMr. Rhodes has built his docks in this city, two of them are the largest\r\non the line of the river. About seven hundred men are employed on works in\r\nwhich he is heavily interested, but nothing troubles him. He says: \"If the\r\nmen don't dig the coal or iron, they don't get paid for it, so I take it\r\neasy, and am giving my attention to farming. I have a stock farm of five\r\nhundred and forty-four and a half acres at Ravenna that I run myself, and\r\nI have another of eighty acres adjacent to the city, rented for gardening,\r\nand still another of twenty-six and a half acres, out on the Detroit road\r\nwhere I intend to build me a home to live and die in, if I do not die away\r\nfrom home.\" He is now only fifty-three years old, hale and hearty, and\r\nseemingly good for another score or two of years.\r\n\r\nHe has four children, the oldest and youngest being daughters. The oldest\r\nis the wife of M. A. Hanna, of the firm of Rhodes & Co. The oldest son,\r\nRobert, is a member of the same firm; the other son, James, has just\r\nreturned from a long visit to the mineral fields of Europe and attending\r\nlectures on metallurgy and mining. By his observation and studies he has\r\nacquired an extensive knowledge of the old world and the modes of working\r\nmines. The youngest daughter, Fanny, is at school at Batavia, New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, Mr. D. P. Rhodes and J. F. Card being tired of the sale department\r\nof their coal business, and having immense interest in mines that\r\nrequired close attention, gave up their sale business in Cleveland to\r\nRhodes & Co., a firm consisting of G. H. Warmington, M. A. Hanna, and\r\nRobert R. Rhodes, who are receiving and selling both coal and iron, the\r\nsame as the old firm.\r\n\r\nThe sales of coal by the firm for the past two years amounted to one\r\nhundred thousand tons per year; together with a large trade in pig iron\r\nand ore. The Willson Bank and Massillon and also Briar Hill grades of coal\r\nare principally handled by this firm, who are also operators largely in\r\nthe Pennsylvania anthracites.\r\n\r\nThe ores passing through Cleveland to supply the manufactories of the\r\nMahoning Valley are from Lake Superior and Canada; the Canada ores forming\r\nquite an extensive item. The firm keep for sale many varieties of pig\r\niron, the most considerable being that of the Tuscarawas iron, but\r\nincluding also the Lake Superior and Salisbury irons.\r\n\r\nThe business of the firm averages one million dollars per year, and\r\nextends through the entire chain of lakes, having agencies at Chicago and\r\nMilwaukee, and also on Lake Superior ports. The Chicago trade is steadily\r\nincreasing, for which there are two or three good reasons, to wit: The\r\ncity is growing very rapidly; the Illinois coals are very inferior to\r\nthose of Ohio, and the local demand for the product of the Illinois coal\r\nfields is very large, owing to the scarcity of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Morris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of biography as a branch of historical literature is\r\nindisputable, and long before reaching this portion of our work the reader\r\nmust have realized the truth, that in the life of the individual can be\r\nseen mirrored not only his individual struggles, \"but all mankind's\r\nepitome.\" The trouble, trials and labors of the one are but specimens of\r\nthe struggles of the many who have to fight the battle of life, and who go\r\ndown to their graves unchronicled. From the story of those whose\r\nexperience is recorded, may be gleaned lessons of hope under the most\r\ndiscouraging circumstances, of perseverance amid difficulties, and\r\nassurances that labor and faith will eventually conquer. These lessons are\r\nforcibly taught in the history of the subject of the present sketch.\r\n\r\nDavid Morris was born of respectable parents, in Sirhowy, Monmouth county,\r\non the border of Wales, July 9th, 1819. His opportunities for acquiring an\r\neducation were limited, but such as they were he made the most of, and\r\nobtained sufficient knowledge of the ordinary branches to enable him to\r\nsuccessfully carry on business in after life. When about twenty years of\r\nage he emigrated to the United States, landing in New York. October 4th,\r\n1839, in company with his mother and the remainder of the children, his\r\nfather having arrived earlier, for the purpose of seeking a location. The\r\nfirst stop was made in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, thence they removed for a\r\nshort time to Llewellyn, and afterwards to Primrose, Schuylkill county.\r\n\r\nIn 1841, he left his parents and went to Middlebury, Summit county, Ohio.\r\nHe at once commenced digging coal for Mr. Philpot, with whom he had been\r\nacquainted in Wales. After a few months he commenced driving team on the\r\nrailroad, and continued in that capacity for about two years. The zeal\r\nand ability shown by the young man attracted the attention of his\r\nemployer, and proved of signal assistance in pushing forward the work. So\r\nmarked was the interest exhibited by Mr. Philpot in his assistant, that\r\nhe favored a closer connection, and in 1843, his daughter, Dorothy\r\nPhilpot, was married to David Morris. The young wife was a lady of more\r\nthan ordinary good qualities, and the union proved a source of unfailing\r\nhappiness, Mrs. Morris being not only an exemplary wife and mother in her\r\nhome, but by her counsel and assistance materially advancing the business\r\ninterests of her husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1847, Mr. Morris, in connection with W. H. Harris, contracted with\r\nLemuel Crawford for mining the Chippewa bank by the ton. After two years,\r\nhe took the management of the work for Crawford & Price, the latter having\r\npurchased an interest. He then went to Girard to work his own mines at\r\nthat point. The coal being of an excellent quality, and the demand\r\nconstantly increasing, these mines became a source of great wealth,\r\nengrossing large capital, and giving employment to a host of workmen.\r\nInstead of the one mine which he found, his original enterprise, his\r\nestate now comprises the Mineral Ridge mines, which have been worked about\r\neighteen years, and have yielded about a hundred and fifty tons per day;\r\nthe Girard mines, worked about the same period, and yielding two hundred\r\ntons daily; and mines at Youngstown, which have been worked eight years.\r\nThe pay roll of these mines now bears about $12,000 per month, and the\r\nfreight bills on the railroad average $3,000 per week. The coal is mostly\r\nbrought to Cleveland, whence it is shipped to Chicago, Milwaukee,\r\nHamilton, and Toronto, a large amount going to the latter place.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, Mr. Morris moved to Cleveland, the amount of business transacted\r\nwith this city making this step prudent. Here the firm of Crawford, Price\r\n& Morris was formed, which subsequently became Price, Crawford & Morris,\r\nand finally Morris & Price. On the 15th of February, 1862, he died in the\r\nforty-third year of his age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truly Yours, David Morris]\r\n\r\nMr. Morris was active, industrious, and unfailing in his watchfulness\r\nover the interests in his charge, both when an employee and when an\r\nemployer. His industry set a good example, which those under him were\r\ninduced to follow, and in this way labors which would have wearied and\r\ndiscouraged men with a less energetic and industrious manager, were\r\nperformed with cheerfulness. He was a man of few words but his manner and\r\nacts spoke more forcibly than words, and his men learned to obey and\r\nrespect an employer, who, instead of ordering and lecturing them, quietly\r\nshowed them how he wished a thing by setting about it with them. He was\r\ncareful to restrain his passions, and to act from judgment instead of from\r\nimpulse. In this way he was not only successful in business, and respected\r\nby his business associates, but possessed the esteem and confidence of his\r\nworkmen, who, when he lay in his last illness, gathered anxiously to learn\r\nevery item of intelligence that could be learned in regard to his\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris was simple and unpretending in his habits, and of a religious\r\nturn of mind. He felt his obligations to God, and during his later years,\r\nespecially, was diligent in his attention on Divine worship. In the\r\nclosing days of his illness, he was constantly engaged in prayer, and\r\ndeparted this life in the assured hope of a peaceful and joyous hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe disease that carried him off was typhoid fever, with which he was at\r\nfirst seized in Cleveland, where he lay at his residence for some weeks.\r\nOn his partial recovery he visited Girard, where he suffered a relapse,\r\nand after a lingering illness, died at the residence of his parents. He\r\nwas buried in Youngstown cemetery, the funeral exercises being attended by\r\none of the largest assemblages of friends ever congregated at that place\r\non a similar occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was feared that with his death the operation of his works would cease\r\nand a large number of people be thus thrown out of employment. But a short\r\ntime before his death he had expressed the desire that the works should be\r\ncarried on after his departure the same as before it; \"because,\" said he,\r\n\"to stop the work would do much harm to others and no good to us.\" Mr.\r\nMorris appointed his wife, Mrs. Dorothy Morris, and Mr. Robert McLauchlan,\r\nexecutors of his will, and trustees of the estate. Mr. McLauchlan, who had\r\nbeen for a number of years engaged with the firm previous to the death of\r\nMr. Morris, and therefore familiar with all its business detail, had the\r\nadditional qualification of being an able financier, and possessing a\r\npractical knowledge of all branches of the coal interest, and above all,\r\na character for unimpeachable integrity. His administration has been\r\neminently successful.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris left a wife and six children to mourn his loss, the eldest of\r\nwhom, Mary, is now the widow of the late A. V. Cannon, and the second,\r\nWilliam, is a member of the firm of Ward, Morris & Co., coal dealers. The\r\nthird, John, is engaged at one of the estate mines, at Niles, Ohio, the\r\nrest being quite young.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. I. Price.\r\n\r\n\r\nW. I. Price was born in Nantiglo, South Wales, May 21st, 1823, and came to\r\nthe United States with his father when about twelve years of age. His\r\nfather settled at Paris, Ohio, where the subject of this sketch remained\r\nuntil he grew up to man's estate, when he removed to Cleveland, and was\r\nengaged as book-keeper with Messrs. Camp & Stockly. The confidence of his\r\nemployers in his business ability and integrity was soon manifested by\r\ntheir sending him to Chicago as their agent in the coal business. His stay\r\nin that city was marked by several severe fits of sickness, and he was\r\neventually compelled to leave that post and return to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return he became interested with Lemuel Crawford, in the\r\nbusiness of mining coal, in the early development of which branch of trade\r\nhe filled a conspicuous and important part. He often related, after the\r\ncoal interest had assumed large proportions, the difficulties to be\r\nsurmounted in introducing coal as an article of fuel, especially on the\r\nsteamboats. Frequently he has sat up all night watching for the steamers\r\nto come in, and then almost gave away coal in order to induce their\r\nofficers to use it.\r\n\r\nThe firm of Crawford & Price was formed in 1850. With persistent energy it\r\ncontinued to push its coal business until it assumed considerable\r\nproportions, when, in 1856, Mr. David Morris became a partner, and the\r\nfirm name was changed to Crawford, Price & Co., and again in 1858, to\r\nPrice, Crawford & Morris. In 1857, the firm of Price, Morris & Co. was\r\nestablished in Chicago, and Mr. Price was, during much of his time,\r\nactively engaged in the extensive coal transactions of that firm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Resp. Yours, W. I. Price]\r\n\r\nMr. Price was married to Miss Harriet Murray, who died in 1850, after two\r\nyears of married life, leaving one child, which only survived her three\r\nmonths. He was married again August 27, 1856, to Miss Caroline Anderson,\r\nof Manchester, Vermont, daughter of Rev. James Anderson, of the\r\nCongregational church.\r\n\r\nBeing in ill health at the time of his second marriage, Mr. Price, with\r\nhis wife, took a trip to Europe, visiting his old home in Wales, and\r\nreturned with his health so much improved that he was scarcely recognized\r\nby his friends.\r\n\r\nThe year 1857 was a most trying time for business men. Mr. Price's labors\r\nwere arduous in the extreme; his energy was unbounded, and the labors he\r\nwas compelled to perform doubtless so over-taxed his strength that he had\r\nnot sufficient vitality to recover.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1858, he had the first serious apprehensions for his\r\nhealth. A bronchial difficulty from which he suffered, was aggravated by\r\ntraveling and exposure, and in the Spring of 1859, he went to New York\r\nfor advice. He was told to make another trip to Europe. This advice was\r\nfollowed, but he returned very little benefited. After a few weeks he\r\nstarted with his wife on a tour south, intending to remain there during\r\nthe Winter. Reaching Charleston, S. C., about the middle of November, he\r\nremained but a short time, and then set out for the Sulphur Springs, at\r\nAiken. Here he improved rapidly, but as the cold came on, and the\r\naccommodations were poor, it was thought advisable to go further south.\r\nAt Savannah he remained a short time, and after wandering from point to\r\npoint, arrived early in February at New Smyrna, where a large company of\r\nEnglish hunters made their headquarters. Here they found better food and\r\naccommodations. After wandering through the South until about the middle\r\nof May, they returned to New York, where they were met by the partner of\r\nMr. Price, Mr. Morris, and Mr. Price's brother Philip. The latter\r\naccompanied them to Manchester, Vermont. The mountain air of that region\r\nstopped the cough of the invalid, and from Thursday, May 17th, to Monday\r\n21st, he was able to sit up, and was attending to business with his\r\nbrother all the morning of the last named day. A friend from Brooklyn\r\ncalled, and with him he conversed for half an hour. On rising to bid him\r\ngood bye, he was seized with hemorrhage, and asked to be assisted to bed.\r\nHe never spoke more, and died in fifteen minutes. His remains were\r\nbrought to Cleveland and interred in Erie street cemetery, but were\r\nafterwards removed to Woodland. The last illness of Mr. Price was borne\r\nwithout a murmur.\r\n\r\nMr. Price was modest and retiring in manner, affable in disposition, and\r\nbenevolent to a fault. He was most beloved where best known. In business\r\ncircles his integrity was proverbial, and his financial ability\r\neverywhere acknowledged. Few men have died so sincerely regretted by\r\nthose who knew him.\r\n\r\nJames Anderson Price, the only child of the subject of this sketch, was\r\nborn April 22d, 1858, and though yet very young, presents in personal\r\nappearance and disposition an exact counterpart of his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. W. Cross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1855, when the coal trade of Cleveland was,\r\ncomparatively, in its infancy, and before the Mahoning Railroad was built,\r\nthe late Oliver H. Perry and David W. Cross set about investigating the\r\ncoal deposits in the Mahoning Valley, which resulted in their making some\r\nleases of coal lands, and in purchasing a coal tract of about one hundred\r\nand fifty acres, known then as the old Heaton coal bank, of Mineral Ridge\r\ncoal. In January, 1856, Perry, Cross & Co. commenced operations in\r\nearnest, opened an office and coal yard on Johnson & Tisdale's dock and\r\nmined and brought to Cleveland the first cargo of Mineral Ridge coal. It\r\ncame by the way of the Pennsylvania and Ohio canal from Niles, Trumbull\r\ncounty, Ohio.\r\n\r\nAt that time, when a gold dollar was only worth a dollar, the coal was\r\nmined at forty cents per ton, the canal freight about one dollar and\r\nseventy-five cents per ton, \"dead work,\" handling, dockage, &c., about\r\nseventy-five cents, making the total cost of that coal on the docks in\r\nCleveland ready for delivery, about two dollars and ninety cents per ton.\r\n\r\nThis mine produced about a hundred tons per day. The company that year\r\nalso received about eight thousand tons of Briar Hill or \"block coal\" from\r\nPowers' bank, about two miles below Youngstown. This coal was also brought\r\nin by canal boats.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1859, Hon. Henry B. Payne, who had an interest in the\r\noriginal purchase of coal lands, with a view of establishing his son,\r\nNathan P. Payne, in business, bought the entire interest of Mr. Perry in\r\nthe concern and the business was continued in the name of D. W. Cross & Co.\r\nMr. N. P. Payne, then an active young man just from his collegiate studies,\r\ntook charge of the retail trade, and Isaac Newton had charge of the books.\r\nIn 1860, arrangements were made with the late Lemuel Crawford to run his\r\nChippewa and Briar Hill mines in connection with the Mineral Ridge mines,\r\nand it resulted in forming the company known as Crawford, Cross & Co., for\r\none year, at the expiration of which time the firm of Cross, Payne & Co.,\r\ncomposed of D. W. Cross, Nathan P. Payne and Isaac Newton, carried on the\r\nbusiness. This firm made extensive explorations for coal. They discovered\r\nand opened the Summit bank coal mines, near Akron, built a locomotive\r\nrailroad three miles long to the canal at Middlebury, and to the Cleveland\r\n& Zanesville and Atlantic & Great Western railroads; repaired the feeder\r\ncanal from Middlebury to Akron, built a basin capable of holding eight\r\ncanal boats, extensive shutes, docks, &c., capable of handling four\r\nthousand five hundred tons per day. This coal tract includes between three\r\nand four hundred acres. The coal is a superior quality of the Massillon\r\ngrade, about four and a half feet thick, and for steam, manufacturing and\r\ndomestic uses is claimed to have no superior. The company employed at this\r\nmine from seventy-five to a hundred and fifty men; built extensive shaft\r\nworks for elevating coal to the surface; erected about forty comfortable\r\ntenements for the workmen and miners, and, in short, used all their past\r\nexperience to make this a model mine. It is the nearest coal bank to\r\nCleveland now open.\r\n\r\nThey also, in connection with the late W. A. Otis, Charles A. Otis and\r\nJames Lewis, leased and purchased several hundred acres of coal lands in\r\nBrookfield, Trumbull county, Ohio, and opened the extensive works known as\r\nthe Otis Coal Company's bank.\r\n\r\nA shaft on this tract was sunk to the coal eight by sixteen feet and a\r\nhundred and fifty-five feet deep, in sixty-one days by Isaac Halford,\r\nsuperintendent, through solid rock, said to be the quickest work ever\r\nknown in the valley. This tract produces an excellent quality of the Briar\r\nHill grade of coal; a locomotive railroad connects it with a branch of the\r\nMahoning Railroad, and the works are capable of mining and raising three\r\nhundred tons of coal per day.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1867, Mr. Cross retired from the business, and the present\r\nfirm of Payne, Newton & Co., composed of N. P. Payne, Isaac Newton and\r\nCharles J. Sheffield, now carry on the extensive business of the entire\r\nconcern. They have ample facilities for mining and handling five or six\r\nhundred tons of coal per day.\r\n\r\nAfter the completion of the Cleveland & Mahoning Railroad the Pennsylvania\r\nand Ohio canal was abandoned, the Railroad Company having obtained control\r\nof the stock, and fixed so high a tariff as to cut off all competition\r\nwith themselves. This effectually killed the canal, except that portion\r\nbetween Akron and Kent. The active trade on this part of the Pennsylvania\r\nand Ohio canal will insure its preservation, and as it is an important\r\nfeeder (supplying water and trade) to the Ohio canal, the State will\r\nundoubtedly take possession of it. The capital invested by this concern in\r\nthe coal trade is about $250,000.\r\n\r\nSince his retirement from the coal trade, Mr. Cross has been actively\r\ninterested in the Winslow Car Roofing Company and the Cleveland Steam\r\nGauge Company, both carrying on their manufactories in Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReligious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough originally settled by people from Connecticut, Cleveland was not\r\nin its early days distinguished for its religious characteristics. Old\r\ninhabitants narrate how in the infancy of the settlement the whisky shop\r\nwas more frequented than the preaching meeting, whenever that was held,\r\nand how, on one occasion, a party of scoffing unbelievers bore in mock\r\ntriumph an effigy of the Saviour through the streets. A regular meeting of\r\ninfidels was held, and burlesque celebrations of the Lord's Supper\r\nperformed. Still later, when the business of slaughtering hogs became an\r\nimportant branch of industry, it was carried on regularly, on Sundays as\r\nwell as on week-days, and as this was a leading feature in the year's\r\ndoings the religious observance of the day was seriously interfered with\r\nduring slaughtering season. Trade on the river, in the busy season, went\r\non with but little regard for the Sundays, except that Mr. John Walworth\r\ninvariably refused, although not a church member, to conform to the usage\r\nof his neighbors in doing business on that day. Unlike the modern\r\nemigrants from New England, the Cleveland pioneers did not carry the\r\nchurch with them.\r\n\r\nThe first regularly organized religious society in Cleveland was the\r\nEpiscopal, which gathered together for religious worship in 1817, under\r\nthe ministration of the Rev. Roger Searles. The meetings were held\r\nwherever a room could be obtained, the court-house, old academy building,\r\nand other public rooms being frequently used for the purpose. In 1828,\r\nTrinity Church was regularly incorporated, and the frame building which\r\nstood on the corner of Seneca and St. Clair streets until its destruction\r\nby fire in 1853, is remembered with affection by many Clevelanders as\r\n\"Old Trinity.\"\r\n\r\nThe next religions organization was Presbyterian. In 1820, a few residents\r\nof Cleveland engaged, the Rev. Randolph Stone, pastor of a church at\r\nMorgan, Ashtabula county, to devote a third of his ministrations to\r\nCleveland. In June of that year the first Sunday school was established\r\nwith Elisha Taylor as superintendent, but it was only by the most\r\npersistent effort that it was enabled to combat the prejudices and\r\novercome the indifference of the people. In September, 1820, the First\r\nPresbyterian church was formally organized, with fourteen members, in the\r\nold log court-house. In 1827, the society was regularly incorporated, and\r\nin 1834, the old stone church on the Public Square was opened for worship.\r\nDuring the whole of this time the congregation had no settled pastor, but\r\nwas dependent on occasional visits of ministers from other places.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at Methodist organization was somewhere between 1824 and\r\n1827. Methodism was not in favor among the early settlers in Cleveland.\r\nThe historian of the Erie Conference relates that a Methodist friend in\r\nNew England, who owned land in Cleveland, sent on a deed for the lot on\r\nthe northeast corner of Ontario and Rockwell street, where Mr. Crittenden\r\nafterwards built a large stone house, which lot would have been most\r\nsuitable for a church, and that no person could be found willing to pay\r\nthe trifling expense of recording, or take charge of the deed, and it was\r\nreturned to the donor. In 1830, Cleveland became a station, with Rev. Mr.\r\nPlimpton, pastor.\r\n\r\nThe first Baptist meeting was held in the old academy, in 1832, the Rev.\r\nRichmond Taggart preaching to a handful of believers. In 1833, the First\r\nBaptist society was formally organized with twenty-seven members, Moses\r\nWhite and Benjamin Rouse, who still live in the city, being of the\r\noriginal deacons. In 1836, their first church, on the corner of Seneca and\r\nChamplain streets, was dedicated with a sermon by the Rev. Elisha Tucker,\r\nof Buffalo, who was afterwards called to the pastorate.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1835, the first Roman Catholic church was built on Columbus\r\nstreet on the flats, and was intended to supply the religious needs of the\r\nRoman Catholics of Cleveland and Ohio City, being situated almost midway\r\nbetween the settled portions of the two places. The first pastor was the\r\nRev. Mr. Dillon.\r\n\r\nIn 1835, the first Bethel church, for the use of sailors, was built at the\r\nback of the site of Gorton, McMillan & Co.'s warehouse. It was a plain\r\nwooden structure, which remained there until the erection of the brick\r\nchurch on Water Street, when the wooden building was removed to make way\r\nfor the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad.\r\n\r\nIn 1839, the first Hebrew synagogue was organized and a brick church was\r\nafterwards built on Eagle street.\r\n\r\nFrom these feeble beginnings have grown up the present religious\r\norganizations of Cleveland, numbering about seventy churches, many of them\r\nof great beauty and costliness, with flourishing Sunday schools and\r\nwealthy congregations. The leading denominations have each several\r\nchurches graded, from stately buildings for the older and wealthier\r\ncongregations to the modest mission chapels. Nearly all the religious\r\nbeliefs of the day are represented by organizations in the city, and all\r\nare in a flourishing, or at least a growing condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSamuel C. Aiken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancestors of Mr. Aiken were from the North of Ireland, particularly\r\nfrom Londonderry, Antrim and Belfast. At an early day one or two colonies\r\ncame over to this country and settled on a tract of land on the Merrimac\r\nRiver, in New Hampshire, calling it Londonderry, after the name of the\r\ncity from which most of them had emigrated. Fragments of these colonies\r\nwere soon scattered over New England, and a few families moved to Vermont\r\nand purchased a tract of land midway between the Green Mountains and\r\nConnecticut River. The township was at first called Derry, and afterwards\r\ndivided, one portion retaining the original name, and the other taking the\r\nname of Windham. In the latter town Dr. Aiken was born, September 21,\r\n1791. His parents were both natives of Londonderry, New Hampshire. Before\r\ntheir marriage, his mother, whose maiden name was Clark, resided a\r\nconsiderable portion of her time in Boston, with a brother and three\r\nsisters, and was there when the Revolutionary war broke out. When the city\r\nfell into the hands of the British, they refused to let any one leave. By\r\nsome means however Miss Clark escaped and crossed over to Cambridge, where\r\nthe American army was stationed under General Washington. After\r\nquestioning her as to her escape and the situation of affairs in the city,\r\nWashington told her, that, in the present condition of the country it was\r\nunsafe for her to travel unprotected, and accordingly gave her an escort,\r\nproving that the great General was also mindful of the courtesies of a\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nWhen about twelve or thirteen years of age, Dr. Aiken, after a preparatory\r\ncourse, entered Middlebury college, in 1813. In his junior year a long fit\r\nof sickness placed him under the care of a physician from Georgia, who\r\nbled him forty times and gave him calomel and julep, (such was the way of\r\ncuring fever,) sufficient to destroy the best constitution. The\r\nconsequence was, his health was so impaired that he was obliged to leave\r\ncollege for a year. Afterwards returning he entered the class of 1814. In\r\nboth classes were quite a number of young men who became distinguished in\r\nChurch and State. Among them was Sylvester Larned, the eloquent preacher\r\nof New Orleans, Levi Parsons and Pliney Fisk, first missionaries to\r\nPalestine, Carlos Wilcox, the poet, Silas Wright, afterwards Governor of\r\nNew York State, and Samuel Nelson, now on the Bench of the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nDr. Aiken's first religious impressions were occasioned by reading\r\nDoddridge's Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul. Faithful parental\r\ninstruction in the Bible and Shorter Catechism had laid the foundation for\r\nbelief in the truth of religion. A revival of religion soon after entering\r\ncollege awakened a new and solemn purpose to devote his life to the work\r\nof the Gospel ministry. The usual course of three years at Andover\r\nTheological Seminary was passed without any special occurrence. He was\r\nthen called by the \"Young Men's Missionary Society\" in New York, to labor\r\nin their service in that city. He had but just entered the field when an\r\nurgent request from the First Presbyterian society in Utica, New York,\r\ntook him to that place, then only a small village, where he was ordained\r\nand installed, the third of February, 1818. Some events of deep interest\r\noccurred while he was in Utica. The building and completion of the Erie\r\ncanal was one. The cholera in 1832, was another. It was there and then\r\nthis fatal epidemic first appeared in the United States. In Utica also\r\nduring his ministry were several revivals of religion of great power and\r\ninterest. Moreover, about that time the subject of anti-slavery began to\r\nbe agitated; opposition and mobs began to gather, which, under the control\r\nof the Almighty, have resulted in the emancipation of millions of slaves.\r\n\r\nImpaired health, after about nineteen years of labor, with very little\r\nrelaxation or relief by traveling, such as is common now, determined him\r\nto accept a call from the First Presbyterian church and society in\r\nCleveland, over which he was installed pastor in November, 1835. Although\r\nthe church had been organized fifteen years, Rev. Mr. Aiken was the first\r\nregular pastor. The ministerial duties were performed by supplies.\r\n\r\nSoon after Mr. Aiken was installed pastor, a great financial revulsion\r\ntook place; and for a period of about ten years he voluntarily\r\nrelinquished three hundred dollars out of his salary of fifteen hundred,\r\nlest it should prove burthensome to the church. This low tide in financial\r\nmatters was characterized by remarkable religious developments; slavery,\r\ntemperance and Millerism became church questions; and it was regarded as\r\nthe peculiar mission of Mr. Aiken to distinguish between truth and error.\r\nHis moderation, judicious advice, and devoted character were just\r\ncalculated to conduct his charge safely through the distractions of that\r\nperiod. The society increased at such a rate that the building became\r\ncrowded, and another church was organized for the West Side. On the East\r\nSide a Congregational church was formed about the year 1840, to which some\r\nof the more radical members of the First Presbyterian church went over. In\r\nprocess of time the nucleus of the Second Presbyterian church on Superior\r\nstreet, and the Third, on Euclid street, were formed out of the First\r\nchurch, not because of any dissatisfaction, however, but for want of room.\r\nBut, notwithstanding these offshoots, a new and larger edifice became\r\nnecessary, and in 1853, the present enlarged, elegant and substantial\r\nbuilding was put up on the site of that of 1834. In March, 1857, the wood\r\nwork of this spacious stone structure was destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nIn his physical constitution, with which the mental is closely allied, Mr.\r\nAiken is deliberate, to a degree which some have greatly mistaken for\r\nindolence. But with a commanding person, and strong will this habitual\r\nabsence of excitement was never tame, but rather impressive. He seldom\r\nrose above the even tenor of his discourse, but never fell to commonplace,\r\nwas generally interesting and occasionally eloquent. His sermons were not\r\nhasty compositions, without a purpose, but well studied, rich with\r\noriginal and important thought, artistically arranged and glowing with\r\ngenuine piety and embellished with scholastic treasures. Dr. Aiken\r\npossessed the accomplishment, and understood the value of good reading, so\r\nrare in the pulpit, and which is scarcely inferior to eloquence. We\r\nremember but few occasions when he became thoroughly aroused. The\r\ndestruction of so fine a church edifice so soon after it was completed\r\nseemed to him a personal calamity. On the following Sunday the\r\ncongregation met in Chapin's Hall. His heart was evidently full of grief;\r\nbut also of submission. His fine enunciation, correct emphasis, and strong\r\nyet suppressed feelings, secured the earnest attention of every hearer. He\r\ntouched graphically upon the power of fire; how it fractures the rock,\r\nsoftens obdurate metals, envelopes the prairies in flame, and how it\r\nseized upon the seats, ceiling and roof in his darling house of worship,\r\nthence fiercely ascending the spire to strive to rise still higher, and\r\ninvade the clouds. From this he turned to the doctrine of submission, in a\r\nmanner so earnest and pathetic that a perceptible agitation pervaded the\r\naudience, in which many could not suppress their tears. There was no\r\nlaboring after effect. It was the natural result of a lofty sentiment,\r\nexpressed with unction, beauty and vigor.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church was\r\nheld at Cleveland. The slavery question was there presented for the last\r\ntime. The Southern members, represented by Rev. Mr. Ross, of Alabama, had\r\ncounted upon what they called a conservative course, on the part of Mr.\r\nAiken. They wished, simply, to be let alone. From the Middle States there\r\nwere many clergyman of moderate views, who expected him to take their\r\nground, or, at least, to be silent. He had advised non-resistence to the\r\nexecution of the fugitive slave law, even on the part of the blacks, in\r\ncases where governmental officials were implicated. As usual, the negro\r\nquestion came up, and a large portion of a day was given to it.\r\n\r\nUntil near the close of the debate the representatives of the Middle and\r\nSouthern States were quite hopeful of a moderate policy, or of no policy.\r\nMr. Aiken sat near the marble pulpit in the Second church without any\r\napparent interest in the discussion. He rose and spoke with difficulty and\r\nin a weak voice, and few words. In a temperate but firm and patriarchal\r\nmanner he recounted the various phases of the question, during his public\r\nministry. He then touched upon the moral and religions aspect of the case,\r\nbut with no asseveration, and concluded by denouncing slavery as an evil,\r\nso monstrous that the church could neither sustain nor ignore it. The\r\nsilence was so complete that no word was lost. When he sat down, the\r\nSouthern members remarked that their fate within the church was settled.\r\n\r\nOn a previous public occasion in 1851, when the Columbus Railway was just\r\ncompleted, and an excursion of State dignitaries made a trial trip to\r\nCleveland, Mr. Aiken was requested to preach in their presence. As this\r\ndiscourse is one of a very few that have been printed, we can give a few\r\nliteral extracts:\r\n\r\n  It was my privilege on the Lord's day to address De Witt Clinton and\r\n  the Canal Commissioners of New York in recognition of the beneficient\r\n  hand of Providence, who had carried them on to the completion of the\r\n  Erie Canal. In a moral and religions, as well as in a social and\r\n  commercial point of view, there is something both solemn and sublime\r\n  in the completion of a great thoroughfare. It indicates not only the\r\n  march of mind and a higher type of society, but the evolution of a\r\n  divine purpose.\r\n\r\nIn his quarter century sermon, June 3d, 1850, he says of revivals:\r\n\r\n  They are as their Divine Author says, like the breath of wind through\r\n  fragrant trees and flowers, scattering grateful odors, pervading the\r\n  universal church with the treasured sweetness of divine grace. If my\r\n  success has not been as great as I would wish, it is as great as I had\r\n  reason to expect. I confess I have much to deplore, and much for which\r\n  to be thankful. There have been adverse influences here to counteract\r\n  those usually falling to the lot of other ministers. So far as the\r\n  subject of slavery is concerned I have endeavored without the fear or\r\n  favor of man to preserve a course best calculated to promote freedom and\r\n  save the church from dismemberment.\r\n\r\nWith such a style, perspicuous, easy and impressive, it is easy to see\r\nhow he might thoroughly absorb the attention of an audience, without\r\naffecting the orator. If he had been more ambitions and more enterprising,\r\nhe might have risen higher as a popular preacher, but would have held a\r\nlower place in the affections of his people. The position of a pastor in\r\nan active and growing city is beset with difficulty on all sides. To\r\nretain place and influence in one congregation during a period of\r\nthirty-five years is an evidence of prudence, character and stability of\r\npurpose more to be desired than outside fame in the church.\r\n\r\nThough not yet arrived at extreme old age, he is too feeble to perform\r\nmuch service. It is ten years since he has retired from active duty, but\r\nhis congregation continue his annual salary by an unanimous vote. Few\r\nclergyman are permitted to witness, like him, the fruits of their early\r\nlabors. He has contributed largely to shape the religions institutions of\r\na city, while it was increasing in population from three thousand to\r\nninety thousand. We remember but one instance where he was drawn into a\r\nnewspaper discussion. This was in the year 1815, in which he reviewed the\r\ndecrees of the Council of Trent in relation to the prohibition of the\r\nScriptures to the common people. The letters of \"Clericus\" and \"Veritas\"\r\non that subject covered the whole ground on both sides, and are worthy of\r\npublication in a more permanent form.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Doctor sustained the relation of pastor to the First Presbyterian\r\nchurch until 1858, when he resigned, leaving the Rev. Dr. Goodrich sole\r\npastor. The whole extent of his ministry from the time of his license by\r\nthe Londonderry Presbytery, 1817, to the present time, March, 1869, has\r\nbeen about fifty-three years. During forty-three years of this period he\r\nhas been a pastor in only two congregations. The other portion of this\r\ntime he has preached and labored in vacant churches and where there was no\r\nchurch, as health and opportunity permitted.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor still resides in Cleveland, beloved by the church over which\r\nfor so many years he watched and prayed, and honored in a community in\r\nwhich he has so long been recognized as an unswerving advocate of right.\r\n\r\nRetired from active duty, and nearing, as he is, the sunset of life, his\r\nquiet hours may bring to him remembrances of vigorous effort and\r\nunmeasured usefulness, while his gentle nature may be cheered by the\r\nconsciousness that he still holds the love of this people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeymour W. Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch, Rev. Seymour Webster Adams, D. D., was born at\r\nVernon, Oneida county, New York, August 1, 1815. His father's name was\r\nIsaac Adams and his mother's maiden name was Eunice Webster--she was a\r\nniece of Noah Webster, the great American lexicographer. His mother is\r\nstill living. His father died in 1861. Dr. Adams was possessed of\r\nremarkable equanimity of temperament, a healthful constitution and great\r\npowers of application and endurance. These traits, the home influences\r\nunder which he was nurtured, developed in a high degree. His early years\r\nwere passed upon his father's farm at Vernon and in the home circle.\r\nHaving before him constantly not only the example of right living, as\r\ngenerally esteemed, but of holy living, he could not do otherwise than\r\nprofit greatly by the example set before him. But he did not only profit\r\nby this example--he went much further. It is said of him, \"As a son he was\r\ndocile, loving, tenderly attached to his kindred, profoundly obedient and\r\nreverent towards his parents, whose wish was the law of his heart, and\r\nwhom he loved to call blessed.\"\r\n\r\nAt the age of seventeen he became a member of the Baptist church at\r\nVernon, and soon after this entered upon a course of preparation for a\r\nliberal education and in due time he entered Hamilton College, Clinton,\r\nNew York, from which he graduated after a full course, taking a very high\r\nposition in his class.\r\n\r\nThat the leading traits of his character while young may be appreciated,\r\nsome of his early writings are here referred to.\r\n\r\nSoon after entering upon his collegiate course he wrote upon \"Integrity of\r\nCharacter,\" and among other things remarked that the man who suffers his\r\nprinciples to be violated \"sacrifices his honor, barters all that is noble\r\nand admirable, and abandons those principles to which he should cling with\r\nan unyielding grasp.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion a little further on he is found maintaining the\r\nnecessity of the exercise of the physical and intellectual powers of man\r\n\"as a wise provision of the Sovereign Ruler of the world\" for man's\r\nhappiness, and he maintains that not only in this should there be activity\r\nbut _energy_.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, in 1841, when he had become a senior and was about to bid\r\nadieu to college life, he chose as the subject of his oration,\r\n\"Development of Character,\" maintaining that no one can become \"deservedly\r\ngreat\" who does not encounter and overcome the impediments and\r\ndifficulties constantly presenting themselves. He says: \"Difficulties may\r\nlong have met the aspirant at every step and been for years his constant\r\ncompanions, yet so far from proving detrimental, they have been among the\r\nmost efficient means for preparing him for vigorous effort to surmount\r\nstill greater barriers.\"\r\n\r\nThese references are deemed sufficient to indicate the principles and\r\nleading traits of the youthful Seymour W. Adams, and as we shall see, were\r\nhis unvarying guides through life. To him it was the same to resolve as to\r\nperform, for whether in earlier or later life he never put his hand to the\r\nplow and looked back. Therefore, having resolved to become a Christian\r\nminister, he never swerved from that resolution for a single moment, but\r\nwent forward with his mind fixed upon his purpose and object as the\r\nmariner's upon his guiding star. In pursuance of his previous\r\ndetermination, in the Fall of 1841 he entered the Hamilton Theological\r\nSeminary at Hamilton, Madison county, New York, from which in regular\r\ncourse he graduated, and after acting as ministerial supply in one or two\r\nplaces, he was called to and accepted the pastorate of the Baptist church\r\nat Vernon, his native place, having previously received ordination. Here\r\nhe was greatly beloved by his people and continued there quietly pursuing\r\nhis duties, until sought out at his village home and invited to accept the\r\nvacant pastorate of the First Baptist church of Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nWhen first invited to the Cleveland pastorate he refused to listen, and\r\ndeclined to entertain the call; but upon the matter being further pressed\r\nupon him, upon the second call he consented to visit Cleveland for the\r\npurpose of becoming acquainted with the people and learning their\r\nsituation, but was careful to give them no encouragement that he would\r\naccept their invitation.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams came to Cleveland in pursuance of this call October 19th, 1846,\r\nand after remaining three weeks returned home to Vernon, leaving it in\r\ngreat doubt whether he would return here. In about a month afterwards, the\r\nchurch at Cleveland calling him was relieved of suspense by his acceptance\r\nof the pastorate. He entered upon it November 22d, 1846. The subject of\r\nhis discourse on this occasion was:\r\n\r\n  \"For they watch for your souls as they that must give\r\n  account.\"--Heb. xiii, 17.\r\n\r\nA few words as to this discourse is deemed not out of place here, as it\r\nhas become historic in the church to which it was delivered. The doctrine\r\nof the discourse was the reciprocal duty of pastor and people. Reference\r\nwill only be made to what appertains to the pastor. He laid down most\r\nrigid rules for him--\"that he should be a holy man,\"--that he should be\r\none that \"hath clean hands and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his\r\nsoul unto vanity.\" That the injunction was laid upon him, \"Keep thyself\r\npure;\" that as the conduct of the minister is observed by many it should\r\nbe fitting as an example to others \"in word, in conversation, in charity,\r\nin spirit, in faith, in purity.\" That in preparation for preaching the\r\nWord \"time, thought and prayer must be given--that the burden of all his\r\npreaching should be 'Christ and him crucified.'\"\r\n\r\nHow well he observed these will appear hereafter in the language of those\r\nwho made addresses at his funeral, or soon afterwards. The reader is also\r\nreferred to the Memoir of Dr. Adams, edited by Judge Bishop.\r\n\r\nIn this pastorate Dr. Adams continued till his decease. No extended\r\nreference can be made to his labors in so brief a sketch as this. A mere\r\nsummary only can be given of his life work. The number of sermons preached\r\nby him, including addresses at funerals, is three thousand four hundred\r\nand ninety-three; number of marriages solemnized, three hundred and\r\nfifty-two; number of funerals attended, five hundred and four; number\r\nreceived into the church, including those received both by letter and\r\nbaptism, about seven hundred. In addition to his other labors, in 1858-9,\r\nhe wrote the life of Rev. Dr. Nathaniel Kendrick, so long and honorably\r\nknown as the founder of the Hamilton Theological School, and which has\r\nsince grown to be Madison University and Hamilton Theological Seminary.\r\nWhile in this work all display and all mere ornament is avoided, it is a\r\nwork of decided merit, requiring severe application and patient industry\r\nto accomplish it. His surviving wife has said that \"his pastoral labors\r\nwere prosecuted regardless of self.\"\r\n\r\nHe was three times married. First to Miss Caroline E. Griggs, who died\r\nApril, 1847. Second, January, 1849, to Mrs. Cordelia C. Peck, widow of\r\nRev. Linus M. Peck, and daughter of Rev. Dr. Nathaniel Kendrick; she died\r\nOctober, 1852. Third, to Miss Augusta Hoyt, August, 1855, who is the\r\nmother of his four surviving children.\r\n\r\nHe was not only a Christian minister, but he was a true Christian patriot,\r\nand never, during all the terrible struggle for the life of the nation,\r\nwhen he offered prayer, did he fail to remember his country. Nearly the\r\nlast work of his life was to accept an appointment in the Christian\r\nCommission to render service in Washington and at the front, relieving and\r\ncomforting the sick and wounded of our army.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of July, 1864, he returned home from this service, quite\r\nunwell, but he thought he could find no space for repose, and labored on\r\nmore intensely than ever, all which time a crisis was approaching which he\r\ndid not anticipate. He at last began to perceive symptoms of severe\r\nillness, and Sabbath, September 11th, he preached his last sermon to his\r\npeople from Heb. iii: 7, 8. \"To-day if ye will hear his voice harden not\r\nyour hearts,\" &c. All that can be said here of this discourse is, that if\r\nhe had known it was his last he could not have spoken more appropriately\r\nor warned more earnestly. From the preaching of this discourse he went to\r\nthe sick-room, and on the 27th of September, 1864, Dr. Adams bade adieu to\r\nearth and passed away.\r\n\r\nHis funeral was attended September 30th, by a great multitude of mourners\r\nand friends, at the First Baptist church, and a large number of the\r\nclergymen of Cleveland participated in the solemnities.\r\n\r\nThis sketch can not be better concluded than by referring briefly to some\r\nof the remarks made on that occasion, as a fitting testimonial to the\r\ncharacter and worth of Dr. Adams.\r\n\r\nRemarks, 1st, by Rev. Dr. Aiken:\r\n\r\n  I have known him intimately, and I have thought, as I have seen him on\r\n  the street, of that passage of Scripture, \"Behold an Israelite indeed in\r\n  whom there is no guile,\" for there was no guile in him. You might read\r\n  his profession in his daily life. He commended daily the Gospel that he\r\n  preached, and gave living witness of its power and showed that he loved\r\n  the truth. He was eminently successful as a pastor and useful in the\r\n  cause of the Redeemer.\r\n\r\n2d, by Rev. Dr. Goodrich:\r\n\r\n  There was manifest a diligence in his study and a thoroughness of\r\n  thought which commanded increased respect the longer we listened to him.\r\n  His life and character made him felt in this community even more than\r\n  his words. He preached one day in the week to his own flock, but he\r\n  lived forth the Gospel of Christ every day before the world. There was\r\n  in him a sincerity and consistency which could not be hid. He was\r\n  transparent as crystal and honest as a little child. No man ever doubted\r\n  him. He was always himself, true, manly, faithful. Men, as they passed\r\n  him in the street, said to themselves, \"There is a man who believes all\r\n  the Gospel he preaches.\" He is gone, but his works follow him. \"Being\r\n  dead he yet speaketh.\"\r\n\r\n3d, by Rev. Dr. Hawks:\r\n\r\n  Possessed naturally of a strong intellect, he disciplined it by the\r\n  severe process of thought and study. His scholarship was accurate and\r\n  thorough, his reading extensive and profitable, by means of these he\r\n  intended to serve, as he did, Christ and the church. Dr. Adams was a\r\n  pastor as well as preacher. He taught not only publicly but from\r\n  house to house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. A. Thome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Armstrong Thome was born in Augusta, Kentucky, January 20, 1813.\r\nHe is of Scotch descent on his father's side, and of North Irish by his\r\nmother, a native Armstrong of the border land. His father was a\r\nPresbyterian of the Scotch type, and a ruling elder in the church. His\r\nmother was a Methodist of the original Wesleyan order and period, having\r\nbeen converted under the labors of the Wesleys at the age of nine. This\r\ndifference of the parents in religious beliefs and church affinities\r\nremained unchanged till the death of the mother, each attending their\r\nrespective meetings; yet, wide as the distinction then was, and warm as\r\nthe prevalent feeling was, between Presbyterians and Methodists,\r\nparticularly in Kentucky, there was neither sectarian width nor warmth\r\nbetween the godly pair, the twain were one flesh and one spirit in\r\nChrist Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe son usually followed his father to church, though he sometimes\r\naccompanied his mother; and during week-day evenings he had the double\r\nadvantage of going to prayer-meeting with the one, and to class-meeting\r\nwith the other. To this two-fold, yet harmonious, religious training in\r\nchildhood the son is indebted for a breath of religious sentiment and\r\nsympathy which made him early a Presbyteria-Methodist in heart, and led\r\nhim subsequently to the mid-way ground of Congregationalism, where many a\r\nPresbyterian and many a Methodist have met in Christian unity,\r\n\r\nHe owes his early conversion to the faithful teachings and pious example\r\nof his parents, to their religious instruction, to family worship, to\r\nSabbath observance, to sanctuary means, in prosecution of the covenant his\r\nparents entered into with God when they consecrated him in infancy.\r\n\r\nThe son's first great sorrow came when he was in his ninth year, in the\r\ndeath of his mother. The loss was irreparable, but it led him to Christ,\r\nFrom the sad moment when the dying mother laid her hand upon his head and\r\nspoke in words never to be forgotten, her last benediction, sorrow for the\r\nsainted dead was blended with penepenitentialrow towards God, and prayers\r\nand tears cried to heaven for mercy. It was not, however, until the age of\r\nseventeen that the blind seeker found the Saviour, and conscious peace in\r\nHim. This happy event was immediately followed by union with the\r\nPresbyterian church, and this by personal consecration to the ministry.\r\nJust before his conversion, his college course, early begun, had been\r\ncompleted. Three years were spent in farther study, and in travel, and\r\ngeneral observation bearing on the chosen calling of life.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of Lane Seminary, under the Theological headship of Dr.\r\nLyman Beecher, the young divinity student chose that school of the\r\nprophets, and joined its first class in 1833. It was a class destined to\r\nbe made famous by a discussion, in its first year, of the slavery\r\nquestion, then beginning to be agitated by the formation of an\r\nanti-slavery society on the basis of immediate emancipation, and by the\r\nactive agitation of the subject in the neighboring city, Cincinnati,\r\nwhereby the mobocratic spirit was aroused, whence threats of sacking the\r\nseminary buildings, and thereupon alarm and hasty action of the trustees,\r\ndisallowing further agitation, and enjoining the disbanding of the\r\nsociety. The students, too much in earnest to yield, after unavailing\r\nattempts at reconciliation with the authorities, the professors mediating,\r\nand Doctor Beecher conjuring his beloved pupils to stay with him, seceded\r\nin a body, in December, 1834. The young Kentuckian, son of a slave-holder,\r\nbecame a thorough convert to the doctrine of emancipation, joined the\r\nanti-slavery society, agitated with his brethren, delivered an address at\r\nthe first anniversary of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in New York,\r\nMay, 1834, and seceded with the class. \"A Statement of the Reasons which\r\ninduced the Students of Lane Seminary to Dissolve their Connection with\r\nthat Institution\"--a pamphlet of twenty-eight pages, signed by fifty-one\r\nnames, and bearing date December 15, 1834, was published and went over the\r\nland, and the city, intensifying the agitation at home, and raising it\r\nthroughout the country. Among the signatures to this document are those of\r\nTheodore D. Weld, H. B. Stanton, George Whipple, J. W. Alvord, George\r\nClark, John J. Miter, Amos Dresser, (afterwards scourged in the Public\r\nSquare of Nashville,) William T. Allen, son of a slaveholding Presbyterian\r\nminister in Alabama, and James A. Thome.\r\n\r\nExiled from the Seminary halls, these rebel reformers took refuge in a\r\nbuilding hard by the city, and extemporized a Theological school,\r\nthemselves being both lecturers and students. The following Spring,\r\nnegotiations being matured for adding a Theological department to the\r\nOberlin Institute by the accession of Professors Finney and Morgan the\r\nseceders went in a body to Oberlin, where they prosecuted their\r\npreparations for the ministry, which were completed in 1836. Among these\r\nfirst graduates of Oberlin Theological Seminary was J. A. Thome. The Winter\r\nof 1835-6, he had spent in lecturing on anti-slavery in Ohio, under\r\ncommission of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The Winter of 1836-7, he,\r\nwith Jos. Horace Kimball, of New Hampshire, visited the British West India\r\nIslands to investigate the results of the abolition of slavery, two years\r\nprior, by act of Parliament. A volume entitled \"Emancipation in the West\r\nIndies,\" prepared by Mr. Thome, and published, in 1837, by the American\r\nAnti-Slavery Society at New York, embodied these observations. The book\r\nwas timely and told efficiently on the reform in this country. The Winter\r\nof 1837, was passed in Kentucky, the abolitionist living among\r\nslaveholders, and officiating as the minister in the church of his father.\r\nThe next Spring he accepted a call to the chair of Rhetoric and Belles\r\nLettres in Oberlin college, and in September following was married to Miss\r\nAnn T. Allen, daughter of John Gould Allen, Esq., of Fairfield,\r\nConnecticut. After ten years of professorial labors, in association with\r\nmen of great worth, most of whom still retain their connection with the\r\ncollege, Mr. Thome entered upon the pastoral work, December, 1848, in\r\nconnection with the church of which he is still the pastor.\r\n\r\nHe has enjoyed a pastorate of twenty years, uninterrupted by serious\r\nill-health, and cheered by successive revivals and consequent accessions\r\nto the church, which, having a membership at the beginning of his\r\npastorate of little over one hundred, now numbers over three hundred,\r\nafter many losses by dismission and death.\r\n\r\nMr. Thome, early converted to anti-slavery, and consistently devoted to\r\nthat cause, has lived to see slavery abolished in America. In addition to\r\nthe volume on West India Emancipation, he wrote, in 1850, a book on\r\nSlavery in America, which was published by the British Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety. Since, a Prize Tract on Prayer for the Oppressed, also a tract\r\nduring the war on \"What are we Fighting for?\" and a treatise on \"The\r\nFuture of the Freed People.\"\r\n\r\nAt the earnest solicitation of the Secretaries of the American Missionary\r\nAssociation, and with the generous consent of his church, Mr. Thome,\r\naccompanied by his wife and daughter, went abroad early in 1867, to\r\nsecure pecuniary assistance from the friends of the freedmen in England\r\nand Scotland for their education and evangelization. He was absent on\r\nthis mission one year. The result of his efforts have not yet ceased to\r\nbe realized.\r\n\r\nAfter thirty years of unbroken domestic felicity, three beloved daughters\r\nhaving been reared to womanhood in the enjoyment of the Christian's hope,\r\nand two of them happily wedded, Mr. Thome and his wife were overwhelmed\r\nwith sorrow by the sudden death, on the last day of April, 1869, of their\r\nsecond daughter, Mrs. Maria E. Murphy, wife of Mr. Thos. Murphy, of\r\nDetroit. A lady of singular amiability, purity, and Christian excellence,\r\nshe was endeared by her sweet graces to rich and poor, to young and old,\r\nthroughout the circle of her acquaintances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Goodrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. William H. Goodrich, D. D., pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of\r\nCleveland, is a native of New Haven, Conn. His ancestry is among the most\r\nhonorable known in American society. His father was the late Rev. Chauncey\r\nA. Goodrich, D. D., a greatly distinguished professor in Yale College; and\r\nhis grandfather, Hon. Elizur Goodrich, for some years a representative in\r\nCongress, and for twenty years Mayor of New Haven; and his\r\ngreat-grandfather, Rev. Elizur Goodrich, D. D., distinguished both as a\r\nclergyman and an astronomer. His mother was the daughter of Noah Webster,\r\nLL.D., the lexicographer.\r\n\r\nHe graduated at Yale college, and was subsequently a tutor in that\r\ninstitution. He studied theology at the New Haven Theological Seminary.\r\nWhile tutor, it was his duty to preserve order about the college grounds,\r\nand he received, (though not from a student,) during a night disturbance,\r\na severe injury upon the head, which put his life in peril and\r\ninterrupted mental labor for a long period. A part of this time was spent\r\nabroad in 1848; and it was not till 1850 that he entered steadily upon\r\nthe duties of his profession. He was first settled as pastor of the\r\nCongregational Church of Bristol, Connecticut, where he remained four\r\nyears. He was then called to the pastorate of the Presbyterian Church in\r\nBinghamton, N. Y., where he remained till 1858, when he removed to this\r\ncity, where, for eleven years, his ministry has been marked by very great\r\nsuccess. The prosperous condition of the church under his care, together\r\nwith almost unparalleled attachment between pastor and people, afford\r\nevidence of the ability and faithfulness with which he has discharged his\r\nministerial duties. To remarkable mental vigor, he adds great delicacy of\r\ncharacter and the warmest sympathies; and those who know most of him,\r\nregard it as no partial judgment which awards him a front rank among\r\npreachers and pastors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly, W. H. Goodrich]\r\n\r\nMr. Goodrich has enjoyed the best of opportunities, and is a writer of\r\nrare taste and rhetorical force, and an eloquent and impressive speaker.\r\nAs a preacher he is never speculative and theoretical, never dogmatic nor\r\nsectarian, but eminently spiritual and practical. But the strongest point\r\nin his character is his downright, never-failing _common sense_. He never\r\nblunders, and never has to apologize for important mistakes committed. He\r\nis remarkable for insight to the character of all with whom he has to do.\r\nThis trait gives him influence with many who care little for the gospel\r\nwhich he preaches. Though not conspicuously demonstrative in his outward\r\nlife, and though free from all approach to obtrusiveness, so earnest and\r\ndirect are his ways, that he becomes known to thousands with whom he has\r\nno personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\nIn this country it is generally regarded as a misfortune to have had a\r\ngrandfather. Most Americans who have reached distinction for abilities and\r\nusefulness, have been the sons of parents unknown to fame. As a general\r\nrule, self-made men are the only well made men. By the force of their own\r\nenergies they have surmounted the difficulties that stood in their\r\npathway, and achieved distinction by their own efforts. There are very few\r\nprominent men in our country whose fathers and grandfathers have left\r\nnames which will live for a score of years in the memory of society. But\r\nto this general truth the history of our country affords honorable\r\nexceptions. The sons of certain families distinguished for wealth, for\r\ntalent and for the highest position in society, have been so wisely and\r\nprayerfully trained that they have escaped the dangers which have proved\r\nfatal to most of those who have inherited honored names, and to this class\r\nMr. Goodrich belongs. Though not ignorant of the truth that his ancestry\r\nis held in the highest honor by all good men, it seems never to have\r\noccurred to him that anything less than his own personal labors and merits\r\nwould avail to give him a good name with those whose good opinion is\r\ndesirable. \"The poet is born, not made.\" _Character is made, not born_.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, Mr. Goodrich was prostrated by severe illness, which for a\r\nseason filled the hearts of his friends with most painful apprehension,\r\nbut the prayers of a loving people were answered, and after an interim of\r\nsix months he again resumed the duties of his pastorate. It soon became\r\napparent, however, that while the \"the spirit\" was \"willing,\" \"the flesh\"\r\nwas \"weak,\" and that a longer respite was necessary before he could again\r\nenter upon his work with his wonted zeal. Hoping to renew his impaired\r\nenergies by a temporary release from care, and in the pleasures of travel,\r\nMr. Goodrich, with his wife, sailed for Europe in 1868, where he remained\r\nfor eight months, re-visiting the scenes with which he had become\r\nacquainted twenty years before. The ultimate object of his tour was\r\nsecured, and at the close of the year he returned to his people in\r\nexcellent health, and with an enriched experience from which he seemed to\r\ndraw new inspiration for his work.\r\n\r\nSoon after his return from abroad, the rapidly failing health of his\r\nmother, residing in New Haven, became to him a constant source of\r\nsolicitude, more especially so from the fact of his being the sole\r\nsurviving child of that once happy and affectionate household. His\r\ndeparture for Europe had been saddened by the sudden death of his only\r\nbrother, Rev. Chauncey Goodrich. In the month of August, 1869, that mother\r\npassed from a life which seemed rounded to completeness, into the\r\n\"day-break of heaven,\" leaving this son, Rev. William H. Goodrich, to rear\r\nthe tablet to her memory, and to go out from a vacant, voiceless home, the\r\nlast of his household.\r\n\r\nBut a quarter of a century has laid grandparents, parents, brother and\r\nsisters in the grave.\r\n\r\nAt the present writing, Mr. Goodrich is once more united to his people,\r\nand we but give utterance to the general voice in the desire, that in the\r\nlove and confidence of this church and community, he may find solace for\r\nhis bereavements; and that henceforth Cleveland may be the home of his\r\nadoption, and the field of his labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac Errett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the preachers and writers of the nineteenth century who have pleaded\r\nfor a return to primitive Christianity, the subject of this notice stands\r\npre-eminently among the most distinguished. For more than thirty-five\r\nyears he has been connected with the Disciples, and, during the greater\r\nportion of that time, has been an earnest, able and successful advocate\r\nfor their plea for reformation.\r\n\r\nIsaac Errett was born in the city of New York, January 2, 1820. His father\r\nwas a native of Arklow, county of Wicklow, Ireland, and his mother was a\r\nnative of Portsmouth, England. His paternal grandfather was shot down in\r\nsight of his own house during the Irish rebellion of 1798. His immediate\r\nparents were both of Protestant families, and became identified with the\r\nDisciples in New York city, as early as 1811--the father being an elder in\r\nthe original church in that place. Hence, the son was trained from infancy\r\nin the principles which he now cherishes, and, in the Spring of 1832, at\r\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania--where his mother had moved soon after the death\r\nof his father, in 1825--when only a little over twelve years of age, at a\r\ntime when the church was without preaching, under the instruction of his\r\nmother, he, in company with an elder brother, went forward and asked the\r\nprivilege of baptism. He was baptized by Robert McLaren, one of the elders\r\nof the church.\r\n\r\nHe now became a diligent student of the Word of God, and, under many\r\nembarrassing circumstances, made constant and encouraging progress.\r\n\r\nFrom the time he was ten years old he has been dependent upon his own\r\npersonal exertions for a living; hence his respectable education has been\r\ngathered in the midst of toil and care, by dint of untiring, industrious\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nWhile laboring as farmer, miller, lumberman, bookseller, printer,\r\nschoolteacher, and editor, he never ceased to augment his stock of useful\r\nknowledge, and to use whatever opportunities he had for the discipline of\r\nhis mental powers.\r\n\r\nHe commenced preaching in the city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the\r\nSpring of 1840, and soon gave promise of the distinguished position which\r\nhe has since held as a preacher of the Gospel.\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed the advantages of frequent and intimate association with\r\nWalter Scott, Thomas Campbell, Alexander Campbell, and most of the early\r\nadvocates of primitive Christianity in the West; and his association with\r\nthese men was of incalculable advantage to him, for they not only gave him\r\nvaluable instruction in the principles of the Reformation, but he was\r\nenabled, by coming in frequent contact with them, to draw inspiration from\r\ntheir lives and characters for the great work upon which he had entered.\r\n\r\nHis ministerial labors have been divided between the work of an evangelist\r\nand pastor. He was pastor of a church in Pittsburgh three years; New\r\nLisbon, Ohio, five years; North Bloomfield, Ohio, two years; Warren, Ohio,\r\nfive years; Muir and Ionia, Michigan, eight years; and Detroit, Michigan,\r\ntwo years. At all these points he was eminently successful, and, besides\r\nhis regular pastoral labors, did considerable work in the general field.\r\n\r\nHe removed to Warren, Ohio, in 1851, and while there, was corresponding\r\nsecretary of the Ohio Missionary Society three years; and it was he who\r\nfirst put that society into systematic and active operation.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, he removed his family to Ionia county, Michigan, and while\r\nlaboring to build up a congregation at that point, he was prevailed upon\r\nto take the corresponding secretaryship of the American Christian\r\nMissionary Society, which position he held three years, and succeeded in\r\nbringing the society to a degree of prosperity which it had never before\r\nreached. When heresigned the Secretaryship he was appointed first\r\nvice-president, and afterwards presided at the annual meetings of the\r\nsociety until 1866, when he was elected president. This, however, he at\r\nonce declined. In the Spring of 1856, he removed to Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1866, he established the Christian Standard in Cleveland, which\r\nhas become a leading and influential religions journal. In August, 1868,\r\nhaving been elected first president of Alliance College, he removed to\r\nAlliance, Ohio, and at once gave to the new college a successful position\r\namong our literary institutions. In May, 1869, he was elected president of\r\nthe Ohio Christian Missionary Society. In August, 1869, he was elected, by\r\na unanimous vote of the Board of Curators of Kentucky University, to the\r\npresidency of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of that University.\r\nAlso, about the same time, Bethany College tendered him the Biblical\r\nDepartment of that institution. We have not learned whether he has yet\r\naccepted either of these positions.\r\n\r\nMr. Errett's personal appearance is striking and prepossessing. He is\r\nabout six feet one inch high, has dark auburn hair, light grey eyes, and a\r\nwell developed muscular organization. As a public speaker he has few, if\r\nany, superiors. His language is chaste and copious, containing an\r\nunusually large per cent, of Saxon words; his gesticulation is easy and\r\nnatural, but his voice, though well under control, has not volume enough\r\nto give full force to his beautiful and stirring thoughts. His writings,\r\nlike his sermons, are full of strong and rugged points, and are frequently\r\ninterspersed with brilliant passages of exquisite beauty that will compare\r\nfavorably with many of the finest word-paintings in the English language.\r\n\r\nIn the social circle he is companionable, but not a very good\r\nconversationalist. He needs the inspiration of an audience, or the quiet\r\nsolitude of the study, to bring out his full strength; hence, while he is\r\npleasant in company--full of wit and humor--he does not appear there to\r\nthe best advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Rouse\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenjamin Rouse was born in Boston, March 23d, 1795, and was brought up as\r\na builder, working at the trade at first in Massachusetts, and\r\nsubsequently removing to New York, where he carried on his business\r\nextensively for about six years. From an early age he had taken great\r\ninterest in religions matters, and especially in the establishment of\r\nSunday schools. In 1830, he accepted the appointment of agent of the\r\nAmerican Sunday School Union for the purpose of going to the West and\r\nestablishing Sunday schools and book depositories. For this purpose he\r\ngave up his business and turned his face westward, prepared to endure\r\nhardships and encounter difficulties for the cause in which he was so\r\ndeeply interested.\r\n\r\nComing directly to Cleveland, he opened his Sunday school book depository,\r\nnear the corner of the Public Square and Superior street. The prospect was\r\nnot a hopeful one, but Mr. Rouse had faith, and persevered. There was but\r\none church building in the place, old Trinity, built by the Episcopalians\r\nwith the aid of those of other denominations, and but little religious\r\nsentiment among the people. A Sunday school had for some time struggled\r\nhard to maintain its existence, and had but just become established on a\r\ntolerably firm basis. The depository, aided by the active labors of Mr.\r\nRouse in the schools, gave a powerful impetus to the cause.\r\n\r\nThree months after the opening of the depository Mr. Rouse purchased the\r\nlot on which it stood, for six hundred dollars. In making the purchase he\r\nhad little thought of its speculative value, the sole object being a\r\npermanent home for his agency. Time has, however, so enhanced the value of\r\nproperty that the lot on which stood the little book-room, has now, with\r\nthe pile of buildings standing on it, reached a value of eighty thousand\r\ndollars, thus amply repaying Mr. Rouse for his labors in the cause of\r\nreligion and morality in the earlier days of the place.\r\n\r\nFor about three years the depository was continued, and then Mr. Rouse\r\nturned his attention for a while to general store-keeping, abandoning it\r\nfinally for the purpose of removing to Richfield, where he went to benefit\r\nthe health of his wife. In that place hie remained six years.\r\n\r\nMr. Rouse was a member of the Baptist denomination, and was largely\r\ninstrumental in the organization of a Baptist society in Cleveland. When,\r\nin 1835, it was decided to erect a church building on the corner of Seneca\r\nand Champlain streets, the experience of Mr. Rouse, then a deacon of the\r\nchurch, was called into requisition. In due time the church was built and\r\na steeple placed on it, which became the wonder and admiration of the\r\ncountry round about, and Trinity, built by the Episcopalians with the aid\r\nof those of other denominations, and but little religious sentiment among\r\nthe people. A Sunday school had for some time struggled hard to maintain\r\nits existence, and had but just become established on a tolerably firm\r\nbasis. The depository, aided by the active labors of Mr. Rouse in the\r\nschools, gave a powerful impetus to the cause.\r\n\r\nThree months after the opening of the depository Mr. Rouse purchased the\r\nlot on which it stood, for six hundred dollars. In making the purchase he\r\nhad little thought of its speculative value, the sole object being a\r\npermanent home for his agency. Time has, however, so enhanced the value of\r\nproperty that the lot on which stood the little book-room, has now, with\r\nthe pile of buildings standing on it, reached a value of eighty thousand\r\ndollars, thus amply repaying Mr. Rouse for his labors in the cause of\r\nreligion and morality in the earlier days of the place.\r\n\r\nFor about three years the depository was continued, and then Mr. Rouse\r\nturned his attention for a while to general store-keeping, abandoning it\r\nfinally for the purpose of removing to Richfield, where he went to benefit\r\nthe health of his wife. In that place he remained six years.\r\n\r\nMr. Rouse was a member of the Baptist denomination, and was largely\r\ninstrumental in the organization of a Baptist society in Cleveland. When,\r\nin 1835, it was decided to erect a church building on the corner of Seneca\r\nand Champlain streets, the experience of Mr. Rouse, then a deacon of the\r\nchurch, was called into requisition. In due time the church was built and\r\na steeple placed on it, which became the wonder and admiration of the\r\ncountry round about, and the especial pride of Deacon Rouse.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Richfield, Mr. Rouse engaged in the coal business in\r\nconnection with Mr. Freeman Butts. About the year 1862, he retired from\r\nactive business and thenceforth devoted his time to the cause of\r\npatriotism, religion, and charity. From the breaking out of the war Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Rouse entered vigorously on the work of aiding the nation's cause\r\nby caring for the nation's defenders. Their zeal and activity were\r\nirrepressible, visiting the camps and hospitals, ascertaining the needs of\r\nthe soldiers, and then with unresting assiduity collecting money and\r\nmaterials to supply those needs. Mrs. Rouse became president of the\r\nSoldiers' Aid Society of northern Ohio, and was directly instrumental in\r\nthe formation of hundreds of auxiliary societies that made every city,\r\nvillage, and nearly every home in northern Ohio busy in the work of\r\npreparing and sending forward comforts and luxuries for the soldiers of\r\nthe Union. Mrs. Rouse visited camps and hospitals in the South, and her\r\nvisits and reports were productive of great good. Her name was known and\r\nrespected by thousands of soldiers, was repeated with grateful praise in a\r\nmultitude of homes from which brave boys had gone forth to the war, and\r\nhas passed into history. In all her labors she was cordially seconded and\r\nefficiently aided by her husband.\r\n\r\nThree sons and one daughter have been born to this worthy couple.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early records of Cleveland, as in those of most western towns, the\r\nstory of sickness and death fills a large part. Fever and ague, brought on\r\nby exposure, privations, and by the miasma from swamp, river and uncleared\r\nlands, disabled a large number of the early settlers, and hurried some to\r\nuntimely graves. There were no physicians, and save a few drugs and the\r\nsimples gathered from the river banks and forest, there were no remedies.\r\n\r\nIn course of time appeared the pioneer doctor with his saddle-bags, and he\r\nwas soon followed by a number of his brethren to practice their skill upon\r\nthe settlers. When the first Cleveland Directory was issued, in 1837,\r\nthere were already established a round two dozen of physicians and\r\nsurgeons, and three \"surgeon-dentists.\" It may be interesting to quote\r\nthe names of these brethren of the lancet and saddlebags who purged and\r\nbled the good people of thirty-two years ago. They were, J. L. Ackley, F.\r\nI. Bradley, C. D. Brayton, W. A. Clark, Horace Congar, E. Cushing,\r\nJonathan Foote, S. B. Gay, Robert Hicks, M. L. Hewitt, Smith Inglehart,\r\nRobert Johnston, Burr Kellogg, David Long, P. Mathivet, George Mendenhall,\r\nJoshua Mills, T. M. Moore, W. F. Otis, A. D. Smith, J. Swain, Charles\r\nTerry, Samuel Underhill, Joseph Walrath. The surgeon-dentists were B.\r\nStrickland, and Coredon & Sargeant.\r\n\r\nThis list has now swollen to proportions that make the two dozen and three\r\nexceedingly insignificant by comparison, and every school of medicine is\r\nrepresented. There are two Allopathic medical colleges--the Cleveland and\r\nCharity Hospital colleges--and two Homeopathic--the Western Homeopathic\r\ncollege and the Homeopathic College for Women. There are also three\r\nhospitals, the Charity Hospital (Allopathic), the Homeopathic Hospital on\r\nUniversity Heights, and the Woman's Hospital on Wilson street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid Long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Long was born at Hebron, Washington county, New York, September 29,\r\n1787. In early life he qualified himself for the practice of medicine and\r\nsurgery, studying in Massachusetts and graduating in New York city. In\r\nJune, 1810, he arrived at Cleveland and commenced his professional career.\r\nAt this early day there was no physician nearer than Painesville on the\r\neast, Hudson on the south-east, Wooster on the south, River Raisin (now\r\nMonroe) on the west. The arrival of a physician was, therefore, a matter\r\nof no small gratification to the settlers here and the neighboring\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nIn this wild region, without roads, streams without bridges, cabins in\r\nmany places eight to ten miles apart, did the young and ardent Long\r\nhopefully commence the practice of medicine. Nor were the hopes of the\r\nearly settlers disappointed. In rain and snow, in Winter's cold and\r\nSummer's heat, by darkest midnight or mid-day sun the doctor ever\r\ncheerfully responded to all the calls for his services with alacrity and\r\nzeal, forgetful of self, desirous only to administer timely relief to the\r\nsuffering and afflicted. In this he was eminently successful, as many of\r\nthose who knew him for more than a third of a century can testify.\r\n\r\nIn proof of the untiring perseverance of Dr. Long in the early part of his\r\nprofessional life, it has been stated that on one occasion, in the Fall of\r\nthe year, about midnight, he rode nine miles in fifty-one minutes. In\r\nanother instance of extreme urgency, he rode, in the day time, fourteen\r\nmiles in fifty minutes by changing horses twice on the route. He was a\r\nsurgeon in the army during the war of 1812, and brought the news of Hull's\r\nsurrender at Detroit to this city, from the mouth of Black River, a\r\ndistance of twenty-eight miles, in two hours and fourteen minutes. Such\r\nwas his character for promptitude to all the calls that were made upon\r\nhim, and they were far from being few.\r\n\r\nFor kindness to his patients and friends he had no superior. In his zeal\r\nin their behalf, in a few years, he sacrificed in a measure one of the\r\nfinest constitutions.\r\n\r\nAfter following his profession thirty years or more, Dr. Long retired\r\nfrom general medical practice, and engaged in other pursuits more\r\nfavorable to his health and congenial to his tastes.\r\n\r\nIn all public measures for the benefit of our city, in the way of\r\nimprovements, schools, churches, every effort in behalf of humanity,\r\nreligion or science, Dr. Long was ready to place his shoulder to the work\r\nwith all the ardor and enthusiasm of youth.\r\n\r\nDr. Long never had any aspirations for political distinctions, but such\r\nwas his popularity and so great the confidence of the people in his\r\njudgment and integrity that he could have obtained it had he so desired.\r\nAt one time, however, he was elected to fill a vacancy which had\r\noccurred by the death of one of the three County Commissioners.\r\nUnimportant as this may seem now, it then occasioned intense excitement.\r\nThe location of a new county court house, presumptively fixing the\r\ncounty seat for all time, devolved upon these Commissioners. Newburg and\r\nCleveland were the contestants, both being villages of about an equal\r\nnumber of inhabitants--the claims of each supported by a single\r\nCommissioner, yet Newburg having the more central location. Though hotly\r\ncontested, Dr. Long was elected, and the result was the erection of the\r\nCourt house in the south-west corner of the square, which was demolished\r\nabout ten years since.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1834, Dr. Long united with the Presbyterian church in this\r\ncity, and by his daily walk and conduct in the community, by his deeds of\r\nlove and charity to the poor, his kindness to the sick and afflicted gave\r\nthe most striking evidence of a heart renewed by grace and made meet for\r\nthe kingdom of heaven. During his last painful illness his calmness and\r\nresignation showed that he had placed his trust firmly upon the sure\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nHe filled all the relations of life in a most exemplary manner and thus\r\nembalmed his memory in the hearts of all who knew and survive him. He died\r\non the first day of September, 1851, at the age of sixty-four years,\r\nlacking a single month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Delamater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before the massacre of St. Bartholomew, the ancestors of Dr.\r\nDelamater fled from France to Holland. The family name was then De La\r\nMaitre. Being whole-souled protestants, they migrated with other Dutch\r\nfamilies to the Province of New York, and settled on the banks of the\r\nHudson, near Kingston. Their names are still visible on the ancient grave\r\nstones of that neighborhood. Like the Huguenots, of South Carolina, they\r\nwere Calvinist, or puritans of the French school. They became allied by\r\nmarriage to the Rogardus family of New York, and others partook of the\r\nblood of Anneke Jans, whose name has become famous in the New York courts.\r\nThe investigation of this connexion and heirship, occupied the last years\r\nof Prof. Delamater's life. It was closed only about a month before his\r\ndeath. His coadjutor in this work, was the late Chancellor Walworth, of\r\nSaratoga, whose ancestors were also in the line of Anneke Jans.\r\n\r\nDr. Delamater was born in Columbia county, New York, near Chatham, on the\r\nState line of Massachusetts, April 18th, 1787. He died at East Cleveland,\r\nin March, 1867, having almost reached the extreme age of four score years.\r\n\r\nThe Huguenots like English Puritans, and the Scotch Irish, have made their\r\nmark in North America. John Delamater, while a boy, was destined to be a\r\nfarmer, on the soil where he was born. He was transferred to the medical\r\nprofession on account of an accident, which injured his ability for manual\r\nlabor. His father removed to Schenectady, New York, where his son was put\r\nunder the tuition of one of the self-denying clergymen of those times,\r\nwhose salary did not meet the expenses of living. At the age of nineteen\r\nhis medical education was finished and he commenced practice in his native\r\ntown. From thence he moved to Florence, Montgomery county, N. Y. Then\r\nstopped a short time in Albany, N.Y., and in 1816, established himself at\r\nSheffield, Massachusetts. There was a settlement of negroes in this\r\nancient borough. Dr. Delamater was then, as ever since, an active\r\nphilanthropist. He attended the negroes as physician, Sunday teacher, and\r\npreacher. They also drew money from his purse, which was never very well\r\nfilled, and paid back very little, either of his fees or of their debts.\r\nAfter some years of assiduous labor on his colored charge, his views of\r\nthe race underwent a radical change. Among the last utterances of his life\r\nhe expressed the opinion, based upon his experience at Sheffield, that the\r\nnegro is by nature unfit for citizenship. In the days of the Jeffersonian\r\nRepublicans and Adams Federalists, Dr. Delamater was in full accord with\r\nthe new and rising Democratic party. He left it during the administration\r\nof General Jackson, and since then was a thorough Whig and Republican. No\r\none hated slavery more. He saw the remnants of it in his early practice\r\nover the line in Connecticut, but never recovered faith in the capacity of\r\nthe colored man for self-government.\r\n\r\nReturning to his medical career, in which for sixty years he led in the\r\nprofession, it is briefly as follows: While practising in the valley of\r\nthe Housatonic, he rode almost constantly on a racking horse, about\r\nsixteen hands high, and almost with the speed of the wind, and\r\noccasionally in a two wheeled vehicle, common in those days, called a\r\nchaise, or more often a \"one horse shay.\" At such times one of his medical\r\nstudents rode beside him, and drove the horse.\r\n\r\nBetween calls along the road the Doctor read his works, especially those\r\nrelating to cases in hand. This custom of keeping up with the new works\r\nand periodicals of the profession he never relaxed, even after old age and\r\nthe most distressing physical infirmities prevented his practice. Neither\r\nwas the old shay ever abandoned; our citizens remember it well, moving\r\ncarefully along these streets, with its huge calash top and faithful\r\nhorse. No storm of rain or snow prevented him from keeping an appointment\r\nwhile he was able to get in and out of his vehicle.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, Dr. Delamater was made Professer in the Medical Institute of\r\nPittsfield, Berkshire county, Mass.; in 1827, at the Fairfield Medical\r\nSchool, Herkimer county, New York. He was at the same time giving lessons\r\nat Bowdoin College, Mass. While at Fairfield, he was invited to lecture in\r\nthe Medical College of Ohio, where Kirtland, Drake and Mussey have\r\noccupied chairs. This resulted in an appointment as Professor in the\r\nWilloughby University, Lake county, Ohio, at that time a flourishing\r\ninstitution. In 1842, he became one of the Faculty of the Western Reserve\r\nMedical College, at Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAlmost every man has some prominent talent, though with many it is never\r\ndeveloped. With Professor Delamater it was the ability to give prolonged,\r\nprofound and perspicuous lectures. This was his special gift and as usual\r\nin such cases he was not a facile writer. It is said he delivered seventy\r\ncourses of medical lectures. His memory was perfect and his reading\r\nembraced everything relating to his profession. A good lecturer requires\r\nnot only a clear perception of his subject, but a lucid and fluent\r\npresentation of it. Dr. Delamater never wrote lectures. His memoranda were\r\nof the most meagre kind. They were frequently nothing more than a few\r\nhieroglyphics made on the margin of a newspaper drawn from his vest pocket\r\nas he mounted the desk. Every case he had ever treated and all its details\r\nappeared to be thoroughly fixed in his recollection. He sometimes wrote\r\nmedical essays for publication, but with evident reluctance. In cases of\r\nmalpractice Dr. Delamater was the especial dread of the attorney whose\r\nside he did not favor. His full, clear and logical statements made a deep\r\nand generally an irresistible impression upon the court and jury.\r\n\r\nAfter he became unable to visit patients he was consulted with never\r\nceasing confidence by physicians and by patients, especially those\r\nafflicted with chronic complaints.\r\n\r\nHis moral and religious qualities were as conspicuous as his mental ones.\r\nHe carried the faculty of conscientiousness to a length which the most\r\nconscientious would regard as extreme. Against the poor his charges for\r\nprofessional service were merely nominal and were never pressed, and with\r\nthe rich he was so moderate and easy that with a large practice he was\r\nbarely able to maintain his family, which, like himself, were afflicted\r\nwith prolonged constitutional diseases. His rare Christian virtues are\r\ndescribed with fidelity and beauty in the farewell discourse of Rev. W. H.\r\nGoodrich, of the First Presbyterian Church, which, being in print, may be\r\nread and preserved by the numerous friends of the good old man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJared Potter Kirtland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. Kirtland belongs to the class of self-made naturalists who attain to\r\ngreater eminence than others of equal talents and better advantages.\r\nSuccess in this branch of science requires not only a native genius, but\r\nenthusiasm and never tiring perseverance; to the rich and the educated\r\nthese last qualifications are frequently wanting, or, if they are not,\r\ninstead of growing with the progress of life, they become more and more\r\nweak instead of more and more strong. Industry and ambition are more than\r\na match for education in minds of the same order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Your Fellow Citizen, J. P. Kirtland]\r\n\r\nDr. Kirtland originated at Wallingford, Connecticut. His father,\r\nTurhand Kirtland, in 1799, was appointed general agent of the\r\nConnecticut Land Company, on the Reserve. He removed to Poland, in\r\nMahoning county, the next year, where he became a prominent citizen of\r\nthe new county then known as New Connecticut. So long as the Company\r\nexisted he was continued in the agency, and survived until 1833 to\r\nwitness the developments of the region.\r\n\r\nJared appears to have been left in Connecticut, probably to secure the\r\nadvantages of those common schools which were wanting in this western\r\nwilderness. The young man made his appearance in Ohio on horseback, July\r\n4th, 1810, at the age of fifteen years. He was destined to be a physician,\r\nand in 1817 he was sent to the celebrated medical school of Dr. Rush, in\r\nPhiladelphia. After leaving that institution he set forth on the way of\r\nlife with horse and saddle bags, dispensing advice and prescriptions,\r\naccording to the custom of the times, to the people of the townships\r\naround Poland. Every old settler knows what a time the pioneer doctors\r\nhad. Their patients were scattered far and wide in log cabins which stood\r\nin small clearings in the forest surrounded by gigantic trees. A messenger\r\nrushed in at any hour of the day or night from a distressed, perhaps a\r\ndistant family, requiring immediate attention. It was the duty of the\r\nfrontier physician to saddle his horse at the moment and return with the\r\nmessenger. The route more often lay along a narrow trail through the\r\nwoods, over roots and logs, with mud and water on all sides. In dark\r\nnights, or in storms of rain and sleet, the overhanging boughs of the\r\ntrees dripping with water, these visits were not of the most cheerful\r\ncharacter. In those early days bridges were behind roads in regard to\r\ncondition and repairs, and it was frequently necessary, in order to reach\r\na suffering patient, to do as Cassius did--plunge in and trust to a\r\nfaithful horse--in order to cross swollen creeks and rivers.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this rude professional practice, acquiring a good\r\nreputation as a physician, he was closely observing the fishes, reptiles,\r\nshells and animals of a region teeming with animal and vegetable life.\r\nScientific works were scarce in that new region, but living subjects were\r\nabundant. This exuberance of life was of more value to a scrutinizing\r\nmind than a surplus of books and a deficiency of specimens. An unusually\r\nrich field for the naturalist lay open to his daily observation for\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence at Poland, Dr. Kirtland was twice elected to the\r\nHouse of Representatives for Ohio. In that body he directed his efforts\r\nespecially to a change in the Penitentiary system. It was mainly through\r\nhis zeal and activity that the old style of treating State prisoners was\r\nabandoned, and they have been made a source of revenue and not of expense.\r\nConvict labor has thus proven by experience to be valuable to the public\r\nand to the convict a relaxation of the rigor of his situation.\r\n\r\nIt was while studying the habits of the fresh water shells of the\r\nMahoning and its branches that Dr. Kirtland made a discovery which\r\nattracted attention throughout the scientific world. The classification\r\nof species had been made upon mere difference of form. Dr. Kirtland\r\nperceived that in the same species a difference of form was due to sex in\r\n_testacea_ the same as in all other animals, and that too many species\r\nhad been adopted. This bold announcement, coming from the back woods of\r\nOhio, created quite a commotion among naturalists. It was, however,\r\nfound, on investigation, to be true, though it rendered obsolete a large\r\nnumber of terrible Latin phrases.\r\n\r\nIn the publication of his views, and afterwards for his descriptions of\r\nthe fishes of Ohio, he found a liberal patron in the Boston Society of\r\nNatural History. When the State of Ohio organized a geological survey, in\r\n1838, the department of Natural History was of course given to him. There\r\nwas barely time to make a catalogue of the fauna and flora of the State\r\nbefore the survey was suspended, but many of his figures and descriptions\r\nof the fishes have since been published in the transactions of the Boston\r\nSociety. This appointment broke up his large medical practice in Trumbull\r\nand adjacent counties. He now accepted the appointment of Professer in the\r\nOhio Medical College at Cincinnati. About 1838, Prof. Kirtland removed\r\nfrom Poland to Cleveland, to perform the same duties in the Cleveland\r\nMedical College. With a restless energy he went beyond natural history and\r\nmedicine in his investigations, into the field of horticulture,\r\nfloriculture and agriculture.\r\n\r\nPurchasing a rugged farm on the ridge road five miles out of Cleveland, he\r\nentered with zeal into the business of scientific farming. Here he\r\ndemonstrated that a stiff clay soil derived from the underlying Devonian\r\nShales may be made highly productive in fruit. His success stimulated\r\nothers along the ridge road, until the old pastures and meadows on that\r\nside of the city have been changed into the most profitable orchards and\r\ngardens in the vicinity. This required twenty years more of time and\r\nindustry, during much of which he came daily to the college and delivered\r\none or more lectures. In the lecture his style is entirely\r\nconversational, but rapid, fluent, and always intelligible. Here all the\r\nvarieties of his studies come into play, as it were, spontaneously. He is\r\nequally at home among the birds, the insects and the reptiles, the fishes\r\nor the mammalia. Their habits are as familiar as those of his children and\r\ngrandchildren. He writes but seldom, and thus the teachings of so many\r\nyears on so many subjects are confided principally to the memory of the\r\nmany hundreds of students to whom they have been delivered.\r\n\r\nFor several years Dr. Kirtland has declined to lecture on any subject. He\r\nis verging upon four score, a period which with most men, is necessarily\r\none of rest if not of weariness, but he has never known what it is to\r\nrest. No farmer in Rockport is up earlier or attends more closely to his\r\ngrounds. All the valuable varieties of peaches, pears, cherries and\r\ngrapes, have been tested by their actual product, or are in the process of\r\nbeing tested. He is enthusiastically fond of the culture of bees and of\r\nevery variety of flowers which will thrive in this climate. A number of\r\nnew varieties of cherries have been originated on the Kirtland farm, and\r\nafter trial those which are valuable have been scattered over the country.\r\nThere are very few men who are enabled to make so many applications of\r\nscience to practical subjects, and still fewer who are permitted to live\r\nlong enough to witness the fruits of their labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodatus Garlick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are almost at a loss in what class to place Dr. Garlick. By natural\r\ntaste and genius he belongs to the artists. His devotion to the healing\r\nart arose principally from the necessities of our race for something to\r\neat and wear. He had the fortune, probably good fortune, to be born in\r\nVermont, at Middlebury, March 30th, 1805, in view of the Green\r\nMountains, among rocks and mountains. This region is principally famous\r\nfor marble, slate, iron ore, and hardy young men, generally known as\r\nGreen Mountain boys.\r\n\r\nAn older brother, Abel B. Garlick, having been apprenticed to a marble\r\ncutter, came out West, sometime after the war of 1812, and located at\r\nCleveland. In 1816, Theodatus, at the age of eleven years, had drifted\r\nas far as Erie, Pennsylvania; in 1819, to Cleveland. The Winter of\r\n1819-20, he spent at Black River, which was then the leading ship yard of\r\nthe lakes.\r\n\r\nAbel B. had artist's ability also. In this region no marble was to be\r\nfound, but a tolerable substitute existed in the fine grained blue\r\nsandstone at Newburg. A mill was erected at the quarry on Mill creek,\r\nbelow the falls, where these stones were sawed, as they are now, into\r\nhandsome slabs.\r\n\r\nLike other New Englanders, the Vermont boys are early impressed with the\r\nidea of self-support. Although Theodatus much preferred fun and frolic to\r\nhard labor, he entered cheerfully upon the business of a stone cutter at\r\nthe age of sixteen. Their marble yard (without marble) was on Bank street,\r\nwhere Morgan & Root's block now stands. Abel marked the outlines of the\r\nletters upon incipient grave stones in pencil, and Theodatus carved them\r\nwith his chisel. Most of the renowned sculptors of Ohio, such as Powell,\r\nClevenger and Jones, took their first lessons in the same way. All of them\r\nhave left samples of their untutored skill in various angels and cherubs,\r\nnow mouldering in old churchyards. The blue sandstone monuments, on which\r\nDr. Garlick cut inscriptions fifty years since, are still to be seen in\r\nthe early cemeteries of the Western Reserve; some are touching enough, but\r\nnot a few are more ridiculous than mournful. When Nathan Perry became so\r\nprosperous that he proposed to remove the old wooden store on the corner\r\nof Water and Superior streets and replace it with a brick one, he\r\nconcluded to expend something upon ornament. He ordered two oval stone\r\nsigns to be made and to be built into the walls over the two doors, one on\r\neach street. These were among the earliest efforts of Dr. Garlick. Both of\r\nthese stones were in existence until the ground was cleared for the\r\npresent Bank building, when they were broken up and put into the cellar\r\nwall. In those days it was one of the duties of an apprentice to sharpen\r\nthe tools at a blacksmith's forge. The young man concluded to carve flying\r\ncherubims with their stone trumpets to ring in the ears of coming\r\ngenerations no longer.\r\n\r\nHaving a robust physical constitution, he became passionately fond of\r\nhunting and fishing. In 1822, he lived with a brother in Newbury, Geauga\r\ncounty, which was then a forest full of game. In a letter referring to the\r\nsporting days of his youth, he wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  My brother and myself started out very early one morning for a deer that\r\n  we knew had been feeding around the cabin that night; within a quarter\r\n  of a mile from the cabin my brother shot him, and as he fired, up jumped\r\n  eleven elk; one of our neighbors shot five of them within an acre of\r\n  ground; they were near together, at bay, fighting with the dogs. I\r\n  helped to get them in; they were a part of a larger herd, we counted\r\n  their beds in the snow where they had lain at night, and there were over\r\n  one hundred in the drove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, T. Garlick]\r\n\r\nTen or fifteen years previous to that time, one of those tornadoes, which\r\noccasionally visit this region, had prostrated the timber along a tract a\r\nmile wide and several miles in length, through the township of Newbury. A\r\nthicket of bushes had sprung up among the fallen trees, which furnished\r\nexcellent browsing ground and shelter for game, of which there was an\r\nabundance of bear, wolves, elk, deer, turkeys, &c., constituting quite a\r\nparadise for a young Nimrod.\r\n\r\nHe finally determined to become a physician, and after some years of the\r\nusual experience of medical students, practicing some, and assisting at\r\noperations, he entered the medical department of the University of\r\nMaryland, in the city of Baltimore, where he graduated in 1834.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was his diploma secured than the artist again broke forth. He\r\nsuddenly produced bas-reliefs in wax of five favorite professors without\r\nsittings, which were pronounced perfect likenesses. General Jackson and\r\nHenry Clay gave him a short sitting, and the next day their statuetts were\r\non exhibition. Mr. Clay expressed his satisfaction for his own in an\r\nautograph letter. Another miniature in relief, full length, of Chief\r\nJustice Marshall, from a portrait by Waugh, was pronounced by Mr. Bullock,\r\nan English virtuoso, as equal to anything produced by Thorwaldsen. But\r\nbeing surrounded by medical men, who, like men of all professions, regard\r\ntheir own as more important than any other, Dr. Garlick was induced to\r\nturn his artistic skill upon anatomical models.\r\n\r\nHe located at Youngstown, Ohio, the same year that he graduated, at which\r\nplace, and at the Medical College of Cleveland, he devoted nearly two\r\nyears in getting up models of all parts of the human body, taken from\r\nsubjects in the dissecting room. They may yet be seen in the Medical\r\nColleges at Cleveland, Buffalo, Toronto, Charleston, South Carolina,\r\nCincinnati, and other places. These were such close imitations of nature\r\nthat the late Professer Mussey, of Cincinnati, pronounced them superior to\r\nthe French models at Paris by Auzoux. At Youngstown he made a life size\r\nbust of Judge George Tod, copies of which are now in the family. In 1853,\r\nafter a successful practice at Youngstown, he came to Cleveland, and\r\nformed a partnership in surgery with the late Professer H. A. Ackley, and\r\nfor a number of years was a member of the Board of Medical Censors of the\r\nCleveland Medical College, and vice president of the Cleveland Academy of\r\nNatural Science. As he was a naturalist, he applied the principles of the\r\nanatomical models to animals and parts of animals, especially fishes. He\r\nentered with great zeal upon the artificial propagation of brook trout and\r\nother fish in connection with Dr. Ackley. In 1857, he published a small\r\nbook, which is the standard work of the United States on this subject.\r\n\r\nHe was a skillful physician and surgeon, a diligent student of natural\r\nhistory, a keen sportsman, and a great lover of the fine arts. A good\r\nphysical constitution is at least one-half of the capital of any man,\r\nhowever gifted in mind. In this respect he was like Christopher North,\r\nwith few equals. In the rude contests of strength among the young men of a\r\nnew country, the races, wrestling matches, and occasional fights, he never\r\nfelt like backing down; but of late years this powerful frame has been\r\npartially stricken with paralysis.\r\n\r\nThe doctor still resides in this city, devoted to natural science,\r\nespecially botany, but the days of his personal activity are past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. L. Cassels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Lang Cassels, M.D., LL.D., was born in Stirlingshire, Scotland, and\r\nin 1827, while quite a young man, came to this country. Soon after, he\r\nstudied medicine with Prof. John Delamater, in Fairfield, New York, and\r\ngraduated in 1834, in the College of Physicians and Surgeons located at\r\nFairfield, N. Y. He was Demonstrator of Anatomy in that school three years,\r\ntwo years during his pupilage and one after his graduation. He opened an\r\noffice for the practice of medicine in Earlville, New York, in the spring\r\nof 1835, and in the fall of the same year received and accepted the\r\nappointment of Professor of Chemistry in Willoughby University, Ohio,\r\nwhich connection he retained until the fall of 1843, when he and his\r\nassociates opened and established the Cleveland Medical College, in which\r\nhe still occupies the chair of Chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, he received the appointment of First Assistant Geologist of the\r\nNew York State Geological Survey, which he occupied for several seasons,\r\nperforming field labor in the summer and lecturing on chemistry in\r\nWilloughby Medical College during the winter. His connection with the New\r\nYork survey gave him an excellent opportunity to become an expert\r\npractical geologist; his location being on the Hudson river district,\r\noffered him a fine field of action, as it is really the key to the geology\r\nand mineralogy of the State.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1839, he gave a course of demonstrated lectures on\r\nchemistry before the Young Men's Library Association in Cleveland, the\r\nfirst public lectures on science ever given in the city. The following\r\nwinter the citizens of Cleveland invited him to lecture again on the same\r\nsubject, and he complied. The city at that time contained mostly young\r\npeople--only two gray-headed men attended the Stone Church.\r\n\r\nIn 1815, he spent most of the season in visiting and collecting specimens\r\nof mineral in the lead region of Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and Missouri,\r\nthus becoming familiar with the geology of their rich mineral region.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, he spent the whole season in exploring the Lake Superior country,\r\ncoasting the south shore in a bark canoe, having for his traveling\r\ncompanions two Indians and a half-breed voyager. At this date there were\r\nno steamers on Lake Superior, and but a very few small sailing craft. It\r\nwas during this time that he took squatter possession of a mile square of\r\nthe iron region of that country, for the benefit of the Cleveland Iron\r\nCompany. He was the first white man that had visited this region, now so\r\nfamous for its ferruginous wealth. Near the close of the season he spent a\r\nshort time geologizing Isle Royale, and returned to Saut St. Marie on the\r\nsteamer Julia Palmer, which had, during the summer, been hauled over the\r\npassage of Saut St. Marie. During the winter following, at the request of\r\na number of Clevelanders, he gave a public lecture on the Lake Superior\r\nregion; at the close of which he said he would venture a prophecy: \"Such\r\nwas the character of the climate, scenery, etc., of Lake Superior that the\r\ntime was not far distant when it would become as great a resort for\r\ninvalids and pleasure-seekers as Saratoga and Newport now are.\" Also, that\r\nthere is iron enough in the iron district sufficient to furnish a double\r\ntrack of the much talked of Whitney's railroad. These statements were then\r\nreceived with a stormy manifestation of incredulity.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, the Jefferson College of Mississippi conferred the Degree of LL.D.\r\non Dr. Cassels.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, he was elected a corresponding member of the Imperial Geological\r\nInstitution of Berlin, Prussia.\r\n\r\nFor the last ten years, in addition to the duties of his chair in the\r\nCleveland Medical College, he has regularly filled the chair of chemistry\r\nand natural history in the Western Reserve College at Hudson. During the\r\npast twenty years he has given several courses of popular experimental\r\nlectures in his favorite branches of chemistry and geology in a number of\r\nour neighboring towns, Akron, Canton, &c. He is also the regular lecturer\r\nin these branches in the Female Seminary in Painesville.\r\n\r\nPerhaps few men have been as extensively engaged in texicological\r\nexaminations during the past twenty years as Dr. Cassels. Many of these\r\nhave been of great interest, both in a social and moral point of view. In\r\nall such cases he is regarded with great confidence, both on account of\r\nhis scientific skill and his high sense of moral integrity.\r\n\r\nAs an analytical chemist he has few superiors, and is much of his spare\r\ntime engaged in the analysis of waters, ores, coal, limestone, &c. In\r\n1866, he analyzed the water of Cleveland which is brought from Lake Erie\r\nand distributed through the city. He analyzed this water taken from\r\ndifferent parts of the city and from the point where it entered the pipes\r\nto be forced into the reservoir; also from a point in the lake three\r\nthousand four hundred and fifty feet from the shore, where he advised that\r\nthe inlet pipe ought to be located. All these analyses are embraced in his\r\nreport to the Trustees of the city water works; in which also are many\r\nvaluable suggestions respecting supply pipes and the character of the\r\nwater for steam purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. S. Newberry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. S. Newberry, M.D., LL.D., was born at Windsor, Connecticut, of old\r\nPuritan stock, his ancestry having formed part of the colony which in\r\n1635, emigrated from Dorchester, colony of Massachusetts Bay, and founded\r\nthe town of Windsor, the first settlement made in Connecticut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Very Truly, J. S. Newberry]\r\n\r\nThe family continued to reside at Windsor for two hundred years, during\r\nwhich time it held an honorable place in that community and contributed\r\nseveral representatives, who took an important part in the affairs of the\r\nState government, or in the defense of the colony against the Indians, and\r\nin the French and Indian and Revolutionary wars. Dr. Newberry's\r\ngrandfather, Hon. Roger Newberry, a distinguished lawyer, and for many\r\nyears a member of the Governor's council, was one of the directors of the\r\nConnecticut Land Company, which purchased a large part of the Connecticut\r\nWestern Reserve. The town of Newberry received its name from him. His son,\r\nHenry Newberry, inherited his interest in the land of the company, by\r\nwhich he became possessed of large tracts in Summit, Ashtabula, Medina,\r\nLorain and Cuyahoga counties, including one hundred acres now within the\r\ncity of Cleveland. Looking after these interests he made three journeys on\r\nhorseback (the first in 1814,) from Connecticut to Ohio, and, in 1824,\r\nremoved his family to Summit county, where he founded the town of Cuyahoga\r\nFalls, remaining there till his death, in 1854.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry graduated at Western Reserve College, in 1846, and from the\r\nCleveland Medical College in 1848. The years 1849 and 1850, he spent in\r\nstudy and travel abroad. Returning at the close of the latter year he\r\nestablished himself, early in 1851, in the practice of medicine in\r\nCleveland. Here he remained till 1855, when his professional business\r\nbecame so engrossing as to leave him no time for the scientific study to\r\nwhich he had been devoted from his boyhood. To escape from too great\r\nprofessional occupation, and impelled by an unconquerable passion for a\r\nscientific career, in May, 1855, he accepted an appointment from the War\r\nDepartment, and became connected with the army as acting assistant\r\nsurgeon and geologist to the party which, under Lieutenant R. S.\r\nWilliamson, U.S.A., made an exploration of the country lying between San\r\nFrancisco and the Columbia river. The results of this expedition are\r\nembodied in Vol. 6 P. R. R. Reports. The reports of Dr. Newberry on the\r\n\"Geology, Botany and Zoology of North California and Oregon,\" are\r\nrepublished in a volume of 300 pp., 4to., with 48 plates. In 1857-8, he\r\naccompanied Lieutenant J. O. Ives, U.S.A., in the exploration and\r\nnavigation of the Colorado river, one of the most interesting\r\nexplorations made by any party in any country. The object of the\r\nexpedition was to open a navigable route of communication with our army\r\nin Utah. To this end an iron steamer was constructed in Philadelphia,\r\ntaken in sections to the head of the Gulf of California, where it was put\r\ntogether and launched. With this steamer the river, before almost\r\nentirely unknown, was navigated for five hundred miles, opening a route\r\nof travel which has since been extensively used. Beyond the point reached\r\nby the steamer the course of the river is for several hundreds of miles\r\nthrough the \"Great Cañon,\" as it is called, a chasm worn by the stream in\r\nthe table lands of the \"Colorado Plateau.\" This cañon has nearly vertical\r\nbanks, and is nowhere less than three thousand feet deep; in some places\r\nsix thousand feet, or more than a mile in depth.\r\n\r\nThe party with which Dr. Newberry was connected, spent nearly a year in\r\nexploring the country bordering the Colorado, adding much to our knowledge\r\nof our western possessions, and giving, in their report, an interesting\r\nand graphic description of, perhaps, the most remarkable portion of the\r\nearth's surface. Half of the report of the Colorado Expedition was\r\nprepared by Dr. Newberry, and so much importance was attached to his\r\nobservations by his commanding officer, that in the preface he speaks of\r\nthem as constituting \"the most interesting material gathered by the\r\nexpedition.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1859, having finished his portion of the Colorado Report, Dr. Newberry\r\ntook charge of another party sent out by the War Department, to report to\r\nCaptain J. N. Macomb, topographical engineer, U.S.A., for the exploration\r\nof the San Juan and upper Colorado rivers. The Summer of 1859 was spent in\r\nthe accomplishment of the object had in view by this expedition, during\r\nwhich time the party traveled over a large part of Southern Colorado and\r\nUtah and Northern Arizona and New Mexico, filling up a wide blank space in\r\nour maps and opening a great area before unknown, much of which proved\r\nrich and beautiful, abounding in mineral wealth, and full of natural\r\nobjects of great interest. Among the results of this expedition were the\r\ndetermination of the point of junction of Grand and Green rivers, which\r\nunite to form the Colorado, and the exploration of the valley of the San\r\nJuan, the largest tributary of the Colorado; a stream as large as the\r\nConnecticut, before almost unknown, but which, though now without an\r\ninhabitant upon its banks, is for several hundred miles lined with ruined\r\ntowns or detached edifices built of stone, and once occupied by many\r\nthousands of a semi-civilized people. The report of this expedition made\r\nby Dr. Newberry, containing much new and interesting scientific matter,\r\nwas finished just before the war, but yet remains unpublished.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the commencement of the war, the United States Sanitary\r\nCommission was organized. Dr. Newberry was one of the first elected\r\nmembers, and it is, perhaps, not too much to say that no other one\r\nindividual contributed more to the great success that attended the labors\r\nof that organization. In September, 1861, he accepted the position of\r\nSecretary of the Western Department of the Sanitary Commission, and from\r\nthat time had the general supervision of the affairs of the Commission in\r\nthe valley of the Mississippi; his head-quarters being first at\r\nCleveland, and subsequently, as the frontier was carried southward, at\r\nLouisville, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThrough his efforts branches of the Sanitary Commission were established\r\nin the principal cities of the West, and agencies for the performance of\r\nits work at all important military points, and with each considerable\r\nsub-division of the army. Before the close of the war the entire West was\r\nembraced in one great System of agencies for the production and\r\ndistribution of supplies, and the care of sick and wounded on the\r\nbattle-field, in hospital or in transitu. The magnitude of the work of the\r\nSanitary Commission at the West may be inferred from the fact that there\r\nwere at one time over five thousand societies tributary to it in the loyal\r\nStates of the Northwest--that hospital stores of the value of over\r\n$5,000,000 were distributed by it in the valley of the Mississippi--that\r\nover 850,000 names were on the records of its Hospital Directory at\r\nLouisville, and 1,000,000 soldiers, for whom no other adequate provision\r\nwas made, were fed and sheltered in its \"homes.\"\r\n\r\nOf this great work Dr. Newberry was the responsible head, and by the\r\nwisdom and energy displayed by himself very much of the harmony and\r\nefficiency which characterized this organization are to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nAs his labors in connection with the Sanitary Commission were drawing\r\nto a close, Dr. Newberry was appointed Professor of Geology in the\r\nSchool of Mines of Columbia College, New York city. He entered on the\r\nduties of the position in 1866. In 1869, he was appointed by Governor\r\nHayes to the office of State Geologist, created by the Ohio General\r\nAssembly of that year.\r\n\r\nThe scientific acquirements of Professor Newberry have given him a\r\nworld-wide fame. As a Geologist his reputation ranks among the foremost.\r\nHe has been honored with the membership of the most of the learned\r\nsocieties of this country, and of many in Europe; was one of the original\r\ncorporators of the National Academy of Sciences; was recently elected\r\npresident of the American Association for the advancement of Science, and\r\nis now president of the New York Lyceum of Natural History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nD. H. Beckwith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Homeopathist in Cleveland was W. K. Adams, who succeeded in\r\nconverting Dr. Hoyt, with whom he formed a partnership. Very soon after,\r\nin 1845, Drs. Wheeler and Williams were added to the list. There were but\r\nsix families in the city having firm faith in the principles of\r\nhomeopathy, and these were silent followers of Dr. John Wheeler, not\r\nwilling to be known as such, so strong was public opinion against them.\r\nDr. Wheeler continued unshaken by the strong opposition he met with, and\r\nheeded neither sneers nor denunciations. His course was onward and his\r\npractice successful, every month adding to his list of converts, and the\r\nprofits of each year doubling the preceding one. Dr. Wheeler was the first\r\nmember of the profession to propose that a homeopathic medical college\r\nshould be located in Cleveland, and he earnestly pressed his theory that\r\nCleveland should be the centre of homeopathy in the West. His name was the\r\nfirst signature to procure a charter, and when the college was organized\r\nhe was selected as the President, and held the office for the first eleven\r\nyears of its existence, contributing materially to its success, and\r\nresigning only when increasing age rendered its duties too onerous, when\r\nadded to a large practice.\r\n\r\nFrom the little beginnings in the early days of Dr. Wheeler's\r\npractice, homeopathy has grown in Cleveland, until it now reckons a\r\nflourishing college, a woman's medical college, two hospitals, an\r\ninsurance company, twenty-six practicing physicians, and a host of\r\nbelievers in homeopathic principles and modes of treatment.\r\n\r\nProminent among the number of practicing physicians is D. H. Beckwith,\r\nM.D., who was born in Huron county, Ohio, in 1826. His father was one of\r\nthe pioneers of the northern part of the State; emigrating from the State\r\nof New York in 1815, and making the journey the most of the way on foot,\r\noccupying more than six weeks. He remained a few days in Cleveland, and\r\nnot admiring the soil for agricultural purposes (little thinking it was\r\nthe site for a city of its present beauty and magnitude), he journeyed on\r\nuntil he reached more fertile soil in Huron county, where, by economy and\r\nindustry, in a short time he accumulated sufficient to purchase a small\r\nfarm, on which he lived until his death, having seen his family of six\r\nsons and one daughter arrive at mature age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Truly Yours, D. H. Beckwith]\r\n\r\nThe subject of this memoir remained at home during his boyhood, attending\r\nschool during the winter and working on the farm in the summer season. At\r\nthe age of sixteen he entered the Norwalk Seminary, pursuing his studies\r\nwith vigor for a few years, when it became necessary for him to earn his\r\nown living. He taught several schools and was among the first in the State\r\nto inaugurate the normal school system to elevate the standard of teaching\r\nand improve public schools.\r\n\r\nEarly in life he decided that the medical profession would be his choice,\r\nand all his leisure hours were spent in studying medical books. After\r\nsecuring a sufficiency from teaching (as he supposed,) to meet the\r\nexpenses of a medical education, he studiously applied himself, under the\r\ntuition of John Tiff, M.D., one of the most scientific practitioners of\r\nthe State. During the third year of his studies his money was expended,\r\nand not wishing to call on friends for assistance he concluded to commence\r\nthe practice of medicine. A partnership was offered him in an adjacent\r\ntown, and arrangements were made for him to commence his professional\r\ncareer. He unfolded his plan to his preceptor, who listened attentively to\r\nhis future plans, and then rising from his chair, exclaimed with much\r\nemphasis: \"If there is anything, sir, that I despise, it is half a\r\ndoctor,\" and immediately left the office. The brilliant prospect was\r\nclouded. With but eight months more study the young student could commence\r\nthe practice of medicine and be an honor to his preceptor and to himself,\r\nbut the lack of money was a seemingly impassable barrier. It was a dark\r\nday to the student, but he had learned \"never to let his energies\r\nstagnate.\" One resource was left him. He determined to open a select\r\nschool for advanced scholars. In four days from that time he entered the\r\nschool room with one hundred scholars, many of them his former pupils.\r\nMorning and evening he clerked in a drug store, for which he received his\r\nboard and washing. On Wednesday and Saturday evenings he was examined in\r\nhis medical studies with two other students who devoted their entire time\r\nto their studies. Thus for thirteen weeks he was daily performing the\r\nduties of a teacher, so arduous that many would have complained, though\r\nthey had no other occupation. In addition to this he was several hours\r\neach day compounding and dispensing medicine, and at the same time keeping\r\npace with his class in the study of materia medica and botany.\r\n\r\nHaving already attended one course of lectures in an allopathic college,\r\nand not being satisfied with that mode of prescriptions for the sick, he\r\nattended the Eclectic College of Cincinnati, where he listened to the\r\nfirst course of lectures ever delivered in any chartered college in the\r\ncountry on homeopathic medicine, by the lamented Prof. Rosa who had no\r\nsuperior in his profession. After receiving his degree he commenced the\r\npractice of medicine with his preceptor. The prompt and curative effect\r\nproduced by homeopathic remedies soon convinced him of its superiority\r\nover other systems of medicine and decided him to adopt it as his system\r\nof practice for life. The success that has attended his labors ever since\r\nhas well proved the correctness of his choice.\r\n\r\nThe first few years of his practice were spent among the acquaintances of\r\nhis childhood, in the beautiful village of Norwalk. In 1852, he left a\r\nlarge practice and many warm friends to seek a larger field for future\r\nwork, and located in Zanesville, Ohio, where he continued his profession\r\nuntil the year 1863. The climate not being adapted to the health of his\r\nfamily he moved to Cleveland and soon obtained what he had left in\r\nZanesville--a large and lucrative practice. By close attention to his\r\npatients, being always ready to give his services to the poor as\r\ncheerfully as to the rich, and his unusual kindness to all persons placed\r\nunder his professional care, he has won the affection and esteem of his\r\npatients to a degree rarely equaled.\r\n\r\nHe has always taken a lively interest in the advancement of medical\r\nscience, firmly believing in the immutable principles that govern the\r\nadministration of homeopathic medicine as well as the curative effect. He\r\nhas always been anxious to induce young men that proposed to study the\r\nscience of medicine to follow the example of the illustrious Hahnemann.\r\nHis lectures in the Cleveland Homeopathic College have always been\r\ncharacterized by practicability. He has not only published a medical\r\njournal, but has largely contributed to the pages of many others in this\r\ncountry. He has always been a leading member of county and State medical\r\nsocieties, as well as of the Northwestern and American Institute of\r\nHomeopathy, holding the office of Vice President of all the above named\r\nsocieties. In 1866, he was chosen by the American Institute as one of the\r\ncommittee to prepare an essay on Cholera, its nature and treatment.\r\n\r\nHe was among the first to establish the Hahnemann Life Insurance Company\r\nof Cleveland, being one of its incorporators and procuring a large amount\r\nof capital stock for its support, besides giving his time in organizing\r\nit. He was chosen their chief medical examiner, and the great success of\r\nthe Company is largely due to his skill in selecting good and healthy\r\nrisks for insurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: T. T. Seelye]\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas T. Seelye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas T. Seelye, M.D., was born in Danbury, Connecticut, August 23, 1818.\r\nHis parents were Seth and Abigail Seelye, of English descent. After\r\npreparing for a collegiate course, it became necessary for him to take\r\ncharge of his father's store. At twenty-one years of age he commenced the\r\nstudy of medicine as a private pupil of William Parker, professor of\r\nsurgery in the College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, from which\r\ncollege he graduated in the Spring of 1842. He was then appointed\r\nassistant physician in Bellevue Hospital, where he remained one year, when\r\nhe commenced the practice of his profession in Woodbury, Connecticut.\r\nThere he remained until the Spring of 1848, when he sold out his business\r\nand removed to Cleveland, having previously leased a tract of land just\r\nwithin the suburbs of the city, covered with native forest and such a\r\nprofusion of real natural beauty in glen, woodland, and beautiful springs\r\nof soft water, that it seemed apparent that art only needed to blend with\r\nnature to make this one of the most desirable of localities for a great\r\nhealth institution.\r\n\r\nHis system of practice, though called water cure, in fact drew assistance\r\nfrom all the experience of the past in relieving physical suffering and\r\ncuring disease. It was not _orthodox_, it belonged to no _pathy_, and in\r\nconsequence had the opposition of all branches of the profession. His\r\nmeans were quite limited, as were also his accommodations--not so limited,\r\nhowever, but that the expense of construction and furnishing greatly\r\nexceeded the length of his purse. Business waited for _success_, to\r\nestablish itself, but the sheriff _did not_. Debts became due, and nothing\r\nwith which to pay, but hope in the future, which is rather unsatisfactory\r\nnutriment for hungry creditors.\r\n\r\nBut, by and by, patient labor and persistent effort in the right direction\r\nbegan to bring forth fruit. Business increased, the visits of the sheriff\r\nwere less frequent, and after about five years he could lie down to rest\r\nat night without fear of a dun in the morning.\r\n\r\nIn ten years he purchased the Forest City Cure, which was started in\r\nopposition, the capacity of the old Cure having become altogether\r\ninadequate for his increased business. After ten years he sold it to the\r\nHebrews for an orphan asylum, preferring to unite the two institutions\r\nunder one roof. He then proceeded to complete the plan he had been\r\nperfecting for the past five years, for erecting buildings of an extent\r\nthat would amply accommodate his ever increasing patronage, and supplied\r\nwith those conveniences and appliances which an experience of twenty-one\r\nyears had deemed most desirable for the invalid. The architect has\r\nfurnished us a sketch of this institution, of which, when completed, every\r\nlover of our beautiful city will be proud.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his professional labors he is largely engaged, in\r\nconnection with W. J. Gordon and others, in the manufacture of the\r\nnon-explosive lamp, which bids fair to be one of the most successful and\r\nextensive manufacturing enterprises ever started in this city.\r\n\r\nWithin the past three years, Dr. Seelye has purchased the twenty-six acres\r\nhe originally leased, and twenty-two acres adjoining, making a very\r\nvaluable tract of real estate, taken in connection with the present and\r\nprospective growth of the city.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Seelye is not engaged conspicuously in public charities, few\r\nhands are so frequently open as his to the wants of the poor. Great\r\ncomprehensiveness of intellect, an indomitable energy, a rare penetration\r\nand control over other minds, combined with an unblemished integrity of\r\ncharacter, have given him a high reputation among physicians in the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Corm.]\r\n\r\n\r\nManufacturing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith neither water power nor steam power very little can be done in the\r\nway of manufacturing. Cleveland, until the construction of the Ohio canal,\r\nwas without either of those two requisites for a manufacturing point. The\r\nCuyahoga river, though giving abundant water power along a considerable\r\nportion of its course, enters Cleveland as a slow moving stream, winding\r\nits sluggish way in so tortuous a course that it seems reluctant to lose\r\nits identity in the waters of the lake. Water power, under such\r\ncircumstances, is out of the question, and, as with no coal, and a rapidly\r\ndecreasing supply of wood, steam cannot be economically used for\r\nmanufacturing purposes, the people of Cleveland turned their attention\r\nwholly to buying and selling instead of producing.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the Ohio canal to the coal fields of Summit county\r\nopened the eyes of the more enterprising citizens to the possibilities of\r\na great future for Cleveland as a manufacturing city. No sooner had the\r\ncanal reached Akron, and an experimental shipment of coal been made to the\r\nfuture city--with but poor success, as already narrated--than attention\r\nwas called to the importance of the new field thus opened to Cleveland\r\nenterprise. On the 7th of March, 1828; a letter appeared in the Cleveland\r\nHerald, from which the following is an extract:\r\n\r\n\"We possess, beyond a doubt, decided advantages over Buffalo, or any other\r\ntown on Lake Erie, in our contiguity to inexhaustible beds of pit-coal and\r\niron ore, very justly considered the basis of all manufacturing. On the\r\none hand, at the distance of about thirty miles, we can obtain any\r\nquantity of crude iron of an excellent quality, while, on the other, at\r\nabout the same distance, we have access by canal to exhaustless mines of\r\ncoal of good quality. This last most invaluable, and all important article\r\nin manufacturing, can not be obtained anywhere else on the Lakes without\r\nthe extra expense of shifting from canal-boats to other craft.\r\n\r\n\"When these mines shall have become extensively worked, coal will be\r\ndelivered in this place very little, if any, above that paid in\r\nPittsburgh, say from four to six cents; and good pig-iron can and is now\r\ndelivered at a less price here than in Pittsburgh. Doctor Cooper further\r\nsays: 'The very basis of all profitable manufacturing is, plenty of fuel,\r\neasily, cheaply and permanently procurable;--the next desirable object is\r\nplenty of iron ore; iron being the article upon which every other\r\nmanufacture depends. It is to the plentiful distribution of these two\r\ncommodities that Great Britain is chiefly indebted for the pre-eminence\r\nof her manufactures and her commerce.' Surely it need not be thought\r\nstrange that Cleveland must one day become a great manufacturing place,\r\nif we consider,\r\n\r\n\"_First_, That the canal will give us access to one of the finest portions\r\nof country in the United States, sufficient for vending, to almost any\r\nextent, articles such as might be manufactured here;--and, _Secondly_,\r\nThat power and materials in great abundance are 'easily, cheaply and\r\npermanently procurable.' There is probably not a town in the Western\r\ncountry, Pittsburgh only excepted, that unites these two objects so\r\nhappily as this place does.\r\n\r\n\"Every steam-engine wanted for boats on the Lake, for mills and factories\r\nnear the Lake, and on and near the canal should be made at this point.\r\n\r\n\"Not a pound of nails, a wagon-tire, an anchor, a cable, a cast-iron\r\nstove, pot, kettle, ploughshare, or any article made of cast-iron--a yard\r\nof coarse cotton, a gallon of beer, an ax, a shovel, nor a spade, should\r\nbe sent east for. There ought to be in full operation before the\r\ncompletion of our canal, at least one steam engine manufactory, one\r\nestablishment for puddling iron, one rolling and slitting mill, and nail\r\nfactory, two or three iron foundries, in addition to the one now going\r\ninto operation under very favorable auspices, a cotton factory, a woolen\r\nfactory, a steam grist and saw mill, a brewery, &c.\"\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding week appeared some editorial comments in support of the\r\nsuggestions in the letter, and for some time frequent references, by\r\ncorrespondents and editorially, were made to the matter. On the 25th of\r\nApril, 1828, appeared in the Herald a notice of a new iron foundry; the\r\nfirst that had been built, and reference to which had been made in the\r\nletter quoted. This was built by John Ballard & Co., and an editorial\r\nannouncing its opening says it \"supplies this place and the surrounding\r\ncountry on short notice and on reasonable terms, with the various articles\r\nof cast iron work, for which, before this foundry was established, our\r\ncitizens were forced to send to a distance, and at the cost of much\r\ntrouble and expense.\"\r\n\r\nBut with all this urging of newspapers, and talking of far-sighted\r\ncitizens, the cause of manufacturing progressed slowly. To establish\r\nmanufactories was a costly experiment, requiring capital, patience, and a\r\nfaith, which, though some might profess, few actually possessed. As is\r\nfrequently the case in regard to public improvements, those who pressed\r\nthem most had no funds to invest in them, and those who had the funds were\r\nlittle inclined to heed the suggestions of moneyless advisers.\r\n\r\nMacCabe's Directory of Cleveland and Ohio City for 1837-8, says that at\r\nthat time there were on the east side of the river, in the corporation of\r\nCleveland, \"four very extensive iron foundries and steam engine\r\nmanufactories; also, three soap and candle manufactories, two breweries,\r\none sash factory, two rope walks, one stoneware pottery, two carriage\r\nmanufactories, and two French run millstone manufactories, all of which\r\nare in full operation.\" A flouring mill was in course of erection by Mr.\r\nFord which, it was predicted, would be, when finished, \"the largest and\r\nmost complete establishment of the kind in the State of Ohio.\" At the same\r\ntime Ohio City was described as possessing \"among the principal\r\nmanufactories of the place, the Cuyahoga Steam Furnace, the Saleratus\r\nmanufactory, and the Glue manufactory.\" The Cuyahoga Steam Furnace had\r\nturned off in the previous year five hundred tons of castings, besides a\r\ngreat quantity of wrought iron work, and gave employment to seventy men.\r\nIn noticing the description of the iron furnaces and steam engine\r\nmanufactories on the East side of the river as \"very extensive\", it must\r\nbe borne in mind that the standard of size and importance for such\r\nestablishments in Cleveland was much smaller then than now.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all the attempts made to stir up an interest in manufactories,\r\nslow progress was made until a comparatively late period. One great\r\nobstacle in the way was the opposition or indifference of the\r\nland-holders, who directly rebuffed the proposals of intending\r\nmanufacturers, or placed a value on their land so high as to require an\r\namount of capital sunk in the soil that rendered the chances of profit\r\nvery hazardous. There was also a strong prejudice against factories on the\r\npart of very many persons because they were \"so dirty,\" and would tend to\r\nmake the neat and trim residences and door-yards of Cleveland as smutty as\r\nthose of Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the breaking out of the war for the Union called into\r\nexistence manufactories all over the land to supply the needs born of the\r\nwar, that manufactories found a home and cordial welcome in Cleveland. The\r\nexigencies of the time, and the intense feeling excited, scattered to the\r\nwind all the prejudices against the dirt and smoke of iron manufactories,\r\nand establishments of this kind sprang up on all sides, calling into\r\nexistence a host of other manufactories dependent on and contributing to\r\nthe successful conduct of iron foundries and iron mills. The war found\r\nCleveland a commercial city, whose trade, if not languishing, threatened\r\nto soon reach its turning point; it left Cleveland a busy, bustling\r\nmanufacturing city, over a great part of which hung a perpetual cloud of\r\ndense smoke, and with a population nearly doubled in numbers and greatly\r\nchanged in character owing to its change from a commercial to a\r\nmanufacturing city. The petroleum discovery in North Western Pennsylvania\r\nand the coincident opening of direct railroad communication between\r\nCleveland and the oil regions, contributed greatly to the rapid increase\r\nof the population and wealth of the city. Oil refineries grew up rapidly\r\nlike mushrooms in the valleys and ravines around, and lined the railroad\r\ntracks, but, unlike mushrooms, did not disappear with equal rapidity. A\r\ngreat number of people found employment in this new industry, and wealth\r\npoured in with greater volume from this source than had ever been known to\r\nflow from any species of trade or manufacture hitherto established. From\r\nthis time the future of Cleveland was assured. Year by year it has grown\r\nwith astonishing increase and new manufactories of every description are\r\nspringing up on every side. The flats that had lain deserted and of but\r\nlittle value were brought into requisition for iron furnaces and iron\r\nmills, and wherever lands could be had at reasonable rates in convenient\r\nneighborhood to transportation lines, factories of some kind were\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe four or five small iron manufactories in and about Cleveland in 1837,\r\nhave grown to fourteen rolling mills, having two hundred puddling furnaces\r\nand a daily capacity of four hundred tons of finished iron, not including\r\nthe nails spikes, nuts, bolts, horseshoes, &c. Several of these mills own\r\ntheir own blast furnaces, and nearly all have coal mines of their own.\r\nThere are also five stove foundries; one malleable iron works; one axe and\r\ntool company; half a dozen boiler plate and sheet iron works of large\r\ncapacity; nearly as many factories of steam engines of all descriptions,\r\nand other machinery; three foundries for making car wheels and castings\r\nfor buildings; one large manufactory of cross cut, circular and other\r\nsaws, and several saw and file works of smaller dimensions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the operations of domestic iron works were seriously affected by\r\nthe large increase of importations from Europe, the following amount of\r\niron was produced from the mills of Cleveland in 1868:\r\n\r\n  Pig Iron                                 11,037 Tons.\r\n  Rail Road Iron                           22,344  \"\r\n  Merchant Iron                            11,396  \"\r\n  Boiler, Tank and Sheet Iron               2,676  \"\r\n  Forgings                                  4,125  \"\r\n  Nuts, Washers, Rests, Nails and Spikes    5,607  \"\r\n  Machinery Castings                       18,250  \"\r\n  Wire                                        865  \"\r\n\r\nMaking a total of 76,300 tons. To produce this it is estimated that\r\n225,000 tons of coal and coke were consumed. The stove foundries produced\r\nnearly 35,000 stoves, with the attendant hardware and stove furniture;\r\nrequiring nearly 10,000 tons of metal, and 4,000 tons of coal and coke,\r\nand giving employment to about five hundred persons.\r\n\r\nThe planing mills and wooden ware manufactures give direct employment to\r\nsix hundred and fifty persons, and the year's business exceeded a\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\nThe growth and magnitude of the petroleum business of Cleveland can be\r\nseen by the reports of receipts and shipments during the past four years:\r\n\r\n  Date.               Crude Received    Refined Forwarded\r\n  1865                 220,000 bbls.    145,000 bbls.\r\n  1866                    613,247 \"     402,430 \"\r\n  1867                    693,100 \"     496,600 \"\r\n  1868                    956,479 \"     776,356 \"\r\n\r\nBetween three and four millions of dollars of capital are invested in this\r\nbusiness in Cleveland, and the annual product will not fall short of ten\r\nor twelve millions of dollars. The rapid increase of the business created\r\nan urgent demand for barrels. The receipts of staves in 1868, mainly to\r\nsupply this demand, were nearly three times in excess of the previous\r\nyear. Some 3,000 tons of hoop iron were required for barrels.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to give, in the absence of any recent exact census, full\r\nand correct statistics of the number and classification of the\r\nmanufactories of Cleveland, the capital invested, and the value of the\r\nproduct. It has, however, been estimated from the best data that could be\r\nprocured, that the grand total value of all the manufactories of the city\r\nin 1868, was not less than sixty millions of dollars, and it is daily\r\nincreasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Castle was born in Essex, Crittenden county, Vermont, November\r\n30, 1814. Immediately on the conclusion of the war, his father removed to\r\nToronto, where he had been engaged, as an architect, to superintend the\r\nconstruction of the first Parliament buildings there. In 1827, he removed\r\nwith his family to Cleveland, William B. Castle being then thirteen years\r\nold. His father had taken a farm about thirteen miles from the city, and\r\nthere the lad spent most of his time until 1832, when, in company with his\r\nfather and Mr. Charles M. Giddings, he established the first lumber-yard\r\nin Cleveland. The business was carried on for a couple of years, when Mr.\r\nCastle, Sen., died, and the son removed to Canada, engaging in\r\nmerchandizing and in manufacturing lumber for the yard in Cleveland. In\r\n1839, he abandoned the Canada branch of the business, and in the following\r\nyear the partnership with Mr. Giddings was dissolved.\r\n\r\nA new partnership was formed with a brother-in-law, under the name of\r\nCastle & Field, for carrying on the hardware, in connection with jewelry\r\nand watch making, business, on the west side of the river, then known as\r\nOhio City. In 1843, he left the business and entered the Cuyahoga Steam\r\nFurnace Company, with which he has ever since been connected. So\r\nthoroughly identified has Mr. Castle been with the history of that\r\nestablishment during the past quarter of a century, that this is a fitting\r\nplace for a brief sketch of the nature and history of the pioneer iron\r\ncompany of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, Mr. Charles Hoyt projected the works which were erected and put\r\nin operation under the firm name of Hoyt, Railey & Co. In 1834, the firm\r\nwas changed to an incorporated company under the name of the Cuyahoga\r\nSteam Furnace Company, with a capital of one hundred thousand dollars, of\r\nwhich three-fourths were paid in. The principal stockholders at the time\r\nof the incorporation were Josiah Barber, Richard Lord, John W. Allen, and\r\nCharles Hoyt. The managing officer was Charles Hoyt. Soon after the\r\nincorporation the works were burned to the ground, but the company were\r\nenergetic, and soon a substantial brick structure, two hundred and\r\nthirty-five feet front, with a wing of ninety feet deep, was erected on\r\nthe site of the destroyed building. The pig metal for the use of the works\r\nwas obtained at the company's blast furnace at Dover, twelve miles west,\r\nand was considered equal in quality to the best Scotch pig. In 1840, Mr.\r\nHoyt was succeeded in the management by D. Cushing, who had been secretary\r\nof the company. In 1843, Mr. Cushing gave place to Elisha T. Sterling, who\r\nremained the head of the concern until his untimely death, in 1859.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, W. B. Castle]\r\n\r\nFrom the advent of Mr. Sterling and the consequent re-organization of the\r\nstaff of officers of the works, dates the connection of Mr. Castle with\r\nthe establishment. Mr. Castle took the position of secretary, and held\r\nthat post until the death of Mr. Sterling, when he was appointed to fill\r\nthe position of manager. At the time when the sole charge of the works\r\ndevolved upon him the company was in a deplorable financial condition. The\r\nprospect was sufficient to daunt a less resolute and hopeful spirit, but\r\nMr. Castle at once set about the Herculean task of bringing the concern\r\nthrough its difficulties and establishing it on a firm financial basis.\r\nThe struggle was long continued, and more than once the advance gained\r\nseemed suddenly to be again lost, but eventually it was pulled through\r\nwithout having compromised a single debt, and without having but a single\r\ncase of litigation under his management. This case was not properly\r\nchargable to the administration of the works, as it arose from the\r\nsupplying of a defective beam strap, which, there being then no forges in\r\nCleveland, had been ordered from Pittsburgh. This unusual exemption from\r\nlitigation was, doubtless, owing to the invariable rule adopted by Mr.\r\nCastle, to reduce all contracts to careful writing and to live strictly up\r\nto the letter as well as spirit of the contract.\r\n\r\nThe heavy work of the establishment in its early years was the supplying\r\nof most of the mills in Ohio and the new States of the West with mill\r\ngearing, and the manufacture of agricultural implements. In 1840, was\r\ncommenced the manufacture of stationary and land steam engines. In 1843,\r\nthe manufacture of marine engines was commenced by building the engine for\r\nthe first propeller on Lake Erie, the \"Emigrant.\" About the same time work\r\nwas commenced on engines for the large side-wheel steamers, the largest of\r\ntheir day being fitted out with machinery from these works. Among the\r\nsteamers thus equipped, and which were in their successive days the\r\nwonders of the lakes, was the Europe, Saratoga, Hendrick Hudson, Pacific,\r\nAvon, and Ohio. Among the propellers receiving their engines from the\r\nCuyahoga Works were the Winslow, Idaho, Dean Richmond, Ironsides, S. D.\r\nCaldwell, Meteor, and a very large number of others, besides a great many\r\nfirst-class steam tugs plying on Detroit river.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, the introduction of the manufacture of locomotives added a new\r\nfeature to the manufacturing industry of Cleveland. The Cleveland,\r\nColumbus and Cincinnati Railroad was supplied from these works, and\r\nlocomotives were also made for the Cleveland and Pittsburgh, Lake Shore,\r\nCleveland and Toledo, and Bellefontaine and Indianapolis Railroads,\r\nbesides several other railroads in the west. In 1857, this branch of the\r\nbusiness was sold out to the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad\r\nCompany, who now use the locomotive works for the manufacture and repair\r\nof their own engines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the marine engines, for which the establishment has become\r\nfamous, the company have lately entered upon the manufacture of first\r\nclass engines and blowing machines for blast furnaces. These have been\r\nsupplied to the furnaces in the Mahoning Valley and Wisconsin, and to\r\nfurnaces elsewhere, even supplying Pittsburgh, the home of the iron\r\nmanufacture. A very large engine has been constructed for the Atlantic\r\nDocks, in Brooklyn, New York. Rolling mill engines and machinery have been\r\nmade for mills at Alliance, in the Tuscarawas Valley, at Harmony, Indiana,\r\nand at Escanaba, in the Lake Superior iron district. Various engines have\r\nbeen supplied to the Newburgh works, including the blowing engines and\r\nhydraulic cranes for the Bessemer steel works, among the most perfect of\r\ntheir kind in America. Railway tools manufactured by the company's works\r\nhave been ordered from so far east as New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe Cuyahoga Steam Furnace Company have employed at times two hundred and\r\nfifty men, and will probably average one hundred and fifty. Year after\r\nyear the company have been compelled to enlarge their facilities, until\r\nnow their property occupies the two corners of Detroit and Centre streets,\r\nand one corner of Centre and West River streets. The buildings extend\r\nthree hundred and fifty feet on the river, and to a greater length on\r\nDetroit street. The capital employed amounts to about a quarter of a\r\nmillion dollars. The importance of these works in attracting attention and\r\ncapital to Cleveland, in giving employment to the people, and in assisting\r\nto build up the business of the city, can hardly be overestimated. Taking\r\nits nature, extent and history together it may probably be said with\r\nsafety that nothing in the city has had a more important influence in\r\nshaping the future of Cleveland and contributing to its present\r\nprosperity, and much of this influence is due to the labor and wisdom of\r\nMr. Castle. At present the works are organized under the presidency of Mr.\r\nCastle, with Josephus Holloway as superintendant and designing engineer;\r\nS. J. Lewis, secretary; W. W. Castle, book-keeper. From 1843 to 1857, the\r\nsuperintendent and designing engineer, was Mr. Ethan Rogers, who by his\r\nknowledge and skill added very much to the celebrity of the works.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, Mr. Castle was elected mayor of Ohio City, and during his term\r\nof office the consolidation of the two cities was effected. To bring\r\nabout this desirable end he labored diligently, and was one of the\r\ncommissioners for settling the terms of annexation. In 1855, he was\r\nelected mayor of the Consolidated city, and his rule was marked by vigor,\r\njustice, and a strict regard for the rights and interests of the\r\ncitizens. For six years subsequent to his mayoralty he held the office of\r\ncommissioner of water works.\r\n\r\nMr. Castle was married in December, 1836, to Miss Mary Derby, who died in\r\nCanada in the following year. In 1840, he was married to Miss Mary H.\r\nNewell, of Vermont, by whom he has had one son and three daughters. The\r\nson, W. W. Castle, now twenty-six, is book-keeper of the Cuyahoga Steam\r\nFurnace Company. The oldest daughter is wife of Mr. Robert R. Rhodes, of\r\nCleveland. The youngest daughters are still at school.\r\n\r\nThe success of Mr. Castle has been achieved by a persistent struggle\r\nagainst adverse circumstances and with but little to aid him but a\r\nresolute will and good constitution. At an early age he was left with the\r\ncare of his father's family on his hands, and has had to fight, not only\r\nhis own battles, but to struggle with the difficulties into which\r\ncircumstances had thrown the company with which he became connected. Out\r\nof the struggle he has come with a spotless reputation, the esteem of his\r\nfriends and the respect of his fellow-citizens, financial prosperity, and\r\nthe blessing of good health and undiminished vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Jarvis Woolson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of August, 1869, the citizens of Cleveland were surprised and\r\npained at the announcement of the death, on the morning of that day, of\r\nCharles Jarvis Woolson, one of the most active and respected business men\r\nof the city. Few were aware of his illness, and even by those acquainted\r\nwith the facts his death, up to within a very short time of the event, was\r\nwholly unexpected.\r\n\r\nMr. Woolson was born in Chester, Vermont, and received careful educational\r\ntraining, the family being in good circumstances. His father was engaged\r\nin various manufacturing enterprises, including cotton and wool fabrics,\r\nand the making of machine and hand cards. He was one of the very earliest\r\nmanufacturers of cooking stoves in the country.\r\n\r\nAt the age of nineteen, Mr. Woolson went into business on his own account,\r\nchoosing the newspaper profession instead of manufactures for his _debut._\r\nHis first venture was as editor and publisher of a newspaper in Grafton\r\ncounty, New Hampshire. Two years later, he sold out and removed to\r\nVirginia, where he assumed charge of the Charlotteville Advocate. But the\r\npolitical and social atmosphere of the South was uncongenial to one born\r\nand bred in the free air of Vermont. He could neither feel nor affect to\r\nfeel anything but abhorrence of the \"institution,\" and so he soon\r\nterminated his connection with the press of Virginia, and returned to the\r\nland of churches, free schools and free speech. In 1830, he married Miss\r\nPomeroy, of Cooperstown, New York, and removing to Keene, New Hampshire,\r\nengaged in mercantile business; but he who has once dabbled in journalism\r\nimbibes a taste which it is difficult afterwards to eradicate. Mr. Woolson\r\nwas not at home in a mercantile store, and before long he purchased the\r\nNew England Palladium, a Boston daily newspaper, and conducted it for two\r\nyears, when he bade a final adieu to journalism as a profession, disposing\r\nof his property in the Palladium and removing to Claremont, New Hampshire,\r\nwhere he engaged with his father in the manufacture of stoves. Here he\r\nremained until 1840, when he removed to Cleveland, taking with him the\r\npatterns and materials connected with the stove business, and commenced\r\non his own account in a small way, his capital having been seriously\r\ncrippled by the financial convulsion of 1837.\r\n\r\nMr. Woolson had, in 1845, succeeded in getting his business into a\r\nflourishing condition, when, through the defalcation of a trusted partner,\r\nhe was very nearly ruined. But he did not stop his works one day on\r\naccount of this disaster. Collecting together his scattered resources, he\r\nset to work all the harder, and as the Fall of the year approached, had\r\nsucceeded in accumulating a fine stock of wares for the Fall trade, which\r\nhe had stored in a warehouse at the rear of his factory, but which he\r\nneglected to insure. A fire broke out, and the building, with its\r\ncontents, was completely destroyed, resolving the valuable stoves into a\r\nheap of old iron. Even this did not stop the works. With his\r\ncharacteristic energy, Mr. Woolson had the ground cleared and set to work\r\nwith redoubled zeal, making new stoves out of the old iron, and succeeded\r\nin doing a tolerable business that winter, in spite of his accumulation of\r\ndisasters.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Woolson commenced business in Cleveland, it was but a lively\r\nvillage. His stove foundry, the first of importance in northern Ohio, when\r\nrunning to its full capacity, employed but ten hands, and its trade was\r\nlimited to the immediate vicinity, and a few towns on the canal. But few\r\nof the farmers then used cooking stoves, the fire on the hearth serving\r\nfor all purposes of cooking and warming. The works now employ about one\r\nhundred hands when running full, and the customers are found in Chicago,\r\nSt. Louis, Kansas, Nebraska, Minnesota and Iowa. The firm was changed\r\nseveral years since to Woolson & Hitchcock, and subsequently to Woolson,\r\nHitchcock & Carter. Death removed the senior and junior partners of the\r\nfirm within a few months of each other.\r\n\r\nMr. Woolson's death was caused by erysipelas, brought on by debility;\r\nafter an illness of two weeks the disease yielded to medical treatment,\r\nand he seemed to gain strength rapidly. On Saturday, the 31st of July,\r\nhe joined a party of friends and drove in his buggy twenty miles into\r\nthe country, believing that the fresh air would invigorate him as it had\r\ndone many times before when his health gave way. But the old remedy\r\nfailed, and, leaving his horse behind, Mr. Woolson took the cars and\r\nreached home in the evening very much exhausted. After lingering five\r\ndays, typhoid symptoms appeared, and at eight o'clock Friday morning he\r\ndied, unconscious, and without suffering, after a life of 63 years and\r\none month.\r\n\r\nMr. Woolson possessed a very genial and sociable disposition, was highly\r\nintelligent and well informed, and in spite of an infirmity of deafness\r\nwas a charming companion. His business qualifications are proven by the\r\nsuccess of the establishment he founded, in spite of the succession of\r\nunforeseen and unavoidable disasters with which it had to contend. He was\r\na man of very domestic habits, and these habits were mellowed and refined\r\nby many family losses that might have crushed one less hopeful, and less\r\npatient and uncomplaining. To his family he was entirely devoted, and all\r\nthe affection of a loving household clustered around him with an intensity\r\nthat made the blow of his sudden loss one peculiarly hard to be borne.\r\n\r\nMr. Woolson had long been connected with Grace Church (Episcopal), of\r\nwhich he was senior warden, and very tender domestic ties, sundered by\r\ndeath some years since, made that church peculiarly dear to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Hart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Hart, son of Judah Hart, of English descent, was born in Norwich,\r\nConnecticut, in the year 1811. About the year 1821, Judah Hart removed to\r\nthe West with his family, settling in Brownhelm, Lorain county, where he\r\ndied two years after, and one year from this time, William changed his\r\nresidence to Cleveland. Soon after the arrival of the Harts in Cleveland,\r\nGovernor Clinton, of New York, came to Ohio to formally commence the work\r\nof constructing the Ohio Canal, which was begun on the fourth of July,\r\n1825. Governor Clinton landed in Cleveland in June, and one of the\r\nprincipal incidents of Mr. Hart's recollection of his early days in\r\nCleveland, was the general turning out of the people to receive and\r\nwelcome the father of internal improvements. Cleveland was then but an\r\ninsignificant village, a place \"six miles from Newburg, where steamboats\r\nstopped to wood and water,\" but great, and well-founded hopes were\r\nentertained of the benefits to flow from the opening of the canal, and the\r\npeople were therefore much elated at the arrival of Governor Clinton, who\r\nwas to commence the important work, and whose influence had done so much\r\nto aid the enterprise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, Wm. Hart]\r\n\r\nAbout this time young Hart went to live with Asabel Abel, to whom he was\r\napprenticed for the purpose of learning the business of cabinet making.\r\nWhen the term of his apprenticeship had expired, he set up in business on\r\nhis own account, at first opening his modest store and workshop on the\r\nsite of the present Birch House, and subsequently, after five or six years\r\nof business, removing his location to the opposite side of the street, on\r\nthe spot now occupied by his present warehouse.\r\n\r\nIn 1852, a fire swept away his entire establishment, destroying\r\nware-rooms, factory, and all the appurtenances, and throwing out of\r\nemployment the twenty hands of which his force of workmen then consisted.\r\nIn the succeeding year, he rebuilt the warehouse and factory on a greatly\r\nenlarged scale, and has since still further enlarged and improved the\r\nbuildings, until, in size and commodiousness, they are not excelled in\r\nthe city. At present, seventy-five hands are employed in the\r\nestablishment, aided by the most improved descriptions of labor-saving\r\nmachinery adapted to the business, and the annual sales reach nearly two\r\nhundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. Hart believed in always putting his shoulder to the wheel, though on\r\none occasion a too literal adherence to this principle came near costing\r\nhim his life. In attempting to give some aid in the factory, he came in\r\ncontact with a circular saw, and his right arm was nearly severed from the\r\nshoulder. This was in the year 1850. On his partial recovery, the\r\ncitizens, to show their sympathy with him in his misfortune, elected him\r\nCity Treasurer, an office then of but little value, requiring only a small\r\nportion of his time and paying him two hundred dollars a year. For\r\nnineteen years he held this office uninterruptedly, being elected by both\r\nparties term after term, and witnessing the growth of the city, under his\r\nfinancial administration, from an annual revenue of forty-eight thousand\r\ndollars to nearly two millions. The emoluments of the office have risen\r\nfrom a salary of two hundred dollars to a salary of fifteen hundred\r\ndollars, and a percentage on special taxes collected. During his nineteen\r\nyears of service, Mr. Hart has negotiated all the loans, sold the school\r\nbonds, and collected the special taxes, occupying nearly the whole of his\r\ntime, and employing the services of a clerk in transacting the business of\r\nhis office.\r\n\r\nWhen William Hart became City Treasurer, the credit of the city stood\r\nrather low, city warrants being hawked about at seventy-five cents on the\r\ndollar. This unsatisfactory state of things was put an end to, mainly\r\nthrough the exertions of the Hon. H. B. Payne, then in the City Council,\r\nwho procured the funding of the outstanding debt, and brought the credit\r\nof the city up to the high standard at which it now stands.\r\n\r\nWhen Judah Hart reached Cleveland, the then far West, a part of the family\r\nslept in the Mansion House, occupying the site on which now stands\r\nCooper's hardware store, but young William and some other members of the\r\nfamily slept in the covered traveling wagon, under a shed standing on the\r\nsite of the present Atwater Block. With the revolution of years the then\r\npoor boy has now become part owner of the splendid block standing where a\r\npart of the Harts slept, homeless wayfarers, forty-five years ago.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, Mr. Hart was married in Cleveland, to Miss Elizabeth Kirk,\r\ndaughter of John Kirk, who had left England about a dozen years\r\npreviously. No children were born of this marriage, but the pair have\r\nadopted four, giving them all the advantages and rights of children born\r\nto themselves, and three of these are now married.\r\n\r\nStill in vigorous life, Mr. Hart has, to a great extent, retired from\r\nactive business, his establishment being carried on mainly by his sons\r\nthrough adoption or marriage. This partial rest he has earned by a life of\r\nlabor and enterprise, in which he has watched narrowly his opportunities,\r\nand availed himself of every chance of improving his facilities for\r\nmanufacture, and enlarging his field of business, has faithfully performed\r\nhis official duties, and has secured the respect alike of his business\r\nacquaintances, his political constituents, and the public at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Bousfield.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wooden ware manufacture of Cleveland is an important part of its\r\nindustry, the manufacturing establishments being the largest within the\r\nUnited States and doing a business that covers the entire west. Large as\r\nthe industry now is, it is of but very recent growth, and Cleveland is\r\nchiefly indebted for its permanent establishment, in spite of a series of\r\ndiscouraging disasters, to the enterprise and determination of John\r\nBousfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, John Bousfield]\r\n\r\nMr. Bousfield was born at Stockport, in the county of Cheshire, England,\r\nJuly 22, 1819. After serving an apprenticeship to the saddle and harness\r\nbusiness for seven years, he engaged in that business on his own\r\naccount, adding to it the manufacture of whips. Four years were thus\r\nspent, when he decided on removing to America, leaving his native land\r\nin December, 1843. Having brought two of his workmen with him, he\r\nestablished himself in the same business in a small way in the city of\r\nNew York, but his health failing after a few months, he determined on\r\nleaving for the west, hoping that a change of atmosphere, and possibly\r\nof business, would be of benefit.\r\n\r\nHis first stay was at Kirtland, Lake county, Ohio, where he purchased a\r\nfarm and at the same time carried on the harness business. At this he\r\ncontinued until about the year 1850, when he purchased a factory and water\r\npower, put in a pail-making machine, and commenced, in a small way, the\r\nmanufacture of pails. In 1854, he removed to Fairport, in the same county,\r\nwhere he purchased a larger building and carried on pail manufacturing\r\nupon a larger scale. In March, 1855, he sold out the establishment, taking\r\nin pay for it a note which he still holds.\r\n\r\nIn May of that year he came to Cleveland and organized the Cleveland\r\nWooden Ware Manufacturing Company, built a factory on the ground now\r\noccupied by the present firm of Bousfield & Poole, and commenced\r\nmanufacturing in the following September. The first operations of the\r\ncompany were on a small scale, making tubs, pails, washboards, and similar\r\narticles in a limited way, but gradually increasing the business until it\r\nreached what was then considered respectable proportions. In July, 1857,\r\nthe company sold out to Greenman & Co., of Massachusetts, and Mr.\r\nBousfield was retained by the new owners as superintendent of the works,\r\nuntil January 12, 1859, when the factory was destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nIn March of that year, Mr. Bousfield rented a building on the West Side\r\nand commenced manufacturing again on his own account. Five months\r\nafterwards he was burned out. Nothing daunted, he immediately purchased\r\nthe ruins of the Greenman & Co. factory, rebuilt it, and in January, 1860,\r\nassociated with him Mr. J. B. Hervey, of Cleveland, and in the following\r\nmonth resumed work.\r\n\r\nThe new partnership was very successful. The business increased rapidly,\r\nthe area of their trade enlarged until it comprised all the principal\r\ncities and towns in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin. A\r\nplaning mill was added to the factory, and this, too, was highly\r\nprofitable. In 1864, the works were greatly enlarged to meet the rapidly\r\nincreasing demand for their wares. In 1865, Mr. John Poole, of Harmer,\r\nOhio, was admitted to the partnership, thus bringing in additional\r\ncapital and experience gained in the management of a similar factory at\r\nHarmer. Mr. Poole has devoted himself principally to the financial and\r\nsales departments of the business, and has proved himself a man of more\r\nthan ordinary business ability.\r\n\r\nThus far everything had been going on prosperously, but the old enemy,\r\nfire, was as relentless as ever. On the 23d of March, 1866, the whole of\r\nthe extensive establishment was reduced to ashes, and the unfortunate\r\nproprietors sorrowfully contemplated the ruins of years of labor and\r\nenterprise, whilst a host of workmen stood still more sorrowfully by, and\r\nsaw their daily bread swept from them by the pitiless flames.\r\nSeventy-five thousand dollars of capital were converted into valueless\r\nashes in a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe owners of the factory wasted no time in fruitless sorrow. An old\r\nwooden building had partially escaped the flames. This was hastily patched\r\nup, and within thirty days they were making pails and tubs as earnestly as\r\nif they had never known a fire. Mr. Hervey sold out his interest to the\r\nother partners, Messrs. Bousfield & Poole, who went to work with almost\r\nunparalleled enterprise and energy, built one of the largest and most\r\nsubstantial factories in the country, and entered upon the work of\r\nmanufacturing wooden ware upon a larger scale than had ever before been\r\nattempted. The factory has two hundred feet front on Leonard and Voltaire\r\nstreets, with a depth of sixty feet, and five stories high; attached to\r\nthe main building are the engine and boiler rooms. The cost of the\r\nbuilding was forty-five thousand dollars. The present capacity of the\r\nworks is twenty-five hundred pails per day, six hundred tubs, a hundred\r\nand twenty-five churns and other small ware, and a hundred dozen zinc\r\nwashboards.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1867, the firm commenced the erection of a match factory which\r\nwas ready for operation in September of that year. A superintendent was\r\nengaged who, unfortunately, was unqualified for his position and did much\r\nharm to the enterprise, but on his removal, Mr. Bousfield took personal\r\ncharge of the match factory, and has succeeded in building up an\r\nextensive trade. The daily capacity of the factory is two hundred and\r\nninety gross, which, if run to the full capacity throughout the year,\r\nwould yield to the United States government a revenue of over a hundred\r\nand twenty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe trade of Messrs. Bousfield & Poole extends from Buffalo through the\r\nprincipal cities of the central, southern and western States, to New\r\nOrleans on the south, and Salt Lake City on the west, two bills having\r\nbeen sold to the son-in-law of Brigham Young in that city. A branch\r\nwarehouse has been established in Chicago as an entrepot for the supply of\r\nthe vast territory of which Chicago is the source of supply.\r\n\r\nThe manufactory of Messrs. Bousfield & Poole is the largest in the\r\ncountry, and for the past three years has turned out about fifty per cent.\r\nmore work than any other in the United States. It consumes ten millions of\r\nfeet of lumber and logs annually, besides other material, and gives\r\nemployment to from three hundred to three hundred and fifty persons, men\r\nwomen and children. Its influence on the population and prosperity of the\r\ncity can therefore be judged. The money for the support of these people,\r\nand for the purchase of the materials employed, is almost wholly brought\r\nfrom abroad, the amount of the wares used in Cleveland being, of course, a\r\nvery small fraction of the amount produced and sold. The same is true to a\r\ngreater or less extent, of all the manufactories of Cleveland, and serves\r\nto account for the rapid growth of the city in population and wealth\r\nwithin the few years past, in which Cleveland has entered in good earnest\r\non its career as a manufacturing centre.\r\n\r\nMr. Bousfield was married January 1, 1855, to Miss Sarah Featherstone, of\r\nKirtland, by whom he has had ten children, six of whom are yet living.\r\nThe oldest son, Edward Franklin Bousfield, is engaged with his father in\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\nThe secret of Mr. Bousfield's successful career can be found in his\r\nindomitable perseverance. He has been wholly burned out three times, and\r\nhad, in all, about twenty fires, more or less disastrous, to contend with,\r\nbut each time he seemed to have gained new strength and vigor in business\r\nas his works rose phoenix like from the ashes. Coupled with his\r\nperseverance is a remarkable mechanical ingenuity which has served him to\r\ngood purpose in the construction and management of his factories. Whilst\r\nin England, he invented a machine for braiding whips that would do the\r\nwork of fifteen women working by hand, as was the usual practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. G. Hussey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the elements that have contributed to the prosperity of Cleveland,\r\ncopper and oil hold no inconsiderable place. Not only has the cupriferous\r\nwealth of Lake Superior directly enriched many Cleveland citizens who\r\ninterested themselves in its production, but it has led to the\r\nestablishment of a large and steadily increasing commerce between\r\nCleveland and Lake Superior. In the other direction, the enterprise of\r\nClevelanders in the petroleum region of Western Pennsylvania has built up\r\nlarge fortunes for themselves and has established in Cleveland one of the\r\nmost extensive and remunerative of its industries. One of the earliest to\r\nbe identified, first with the copper and afterwards with the oil interest,\r\nwas J. G. Hussey.\r\n\r\nChristopher Hussey, the father of the subject of the present sketch,\r\nemigrated from Baltimore and settled in Cincinnati, in 1804, subsequently\r\nremoving to Jefferson county, Ohio, where J. G. Hussey was born in 1819.\r\nYoung Hussey received such an education as the facilities of a rural\r\nneighborhood at that early day afforded, and added to his school knowledge\r\nthe practical details of business by becoming clerk in a village store.\r\nHere he acquired those correct business habits that stood him in good\r\nservice in after life. In 1840, he opened a store on his own account in\r\nHanover, Ohio, and was very successful. From Hanover he removed to\r\nPittsburgh, where he operated in provisions until 1845. In that year there\r\nwas much excitement over the mineral discoveries on the south shore of\r\nLake Superior. The Indian titles to the mineral lands on that lake had\r\nbeen but a short time before completely extinguished, and the surveys of\r\nDr. Houghton were bringing the cupriferous riches of the region into\r\nnotice. Mining permits were issued under the authority of Congress, those\r\npermits giving the applicant a lease for three years, with a conditional\r\nre-issue for three years more. The lessees were to work the mines with due\r\ndiligence and skill, and to pay a royalty to the United States of six per\r\ncent, of all the ores raised. Early in the Spring of 1845, Mr. Hussey\r\nformed a company of miners and explorers, with whom he went to Lake\r\nSuperior and opened several copper veins, some of which proved highly\r\nproductive and are still successfully worked. In some of these he has\r\nretained an interest to the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, J. G. Hussey]\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1847, he became a member of the private banking firm\r\nof Hussey, Hanna & Co., in Pittsburgh, which did a successful business\r\nfor several years. At the same time he became interested in a banking\r\nestablishment in Milwaukee under the firm name of Marshall, Hussey &\r\nIlsley. In 1850, he removed to Milwaukee, to attend to the interest of\r\nthat firm, but the climate proving injurions to his health, he sold out\r\nand removed to Cleveland, where he took up his residence in 1851. From\r\nthat time he became thoroughly identified with the business interests\r\nof the city.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to establish the Forest City Bank, under the regulations\r\nof the Free Banking Law of Ohio, and during his connection with the\r\ninstitution it was eminently successful. During the same summer, he built\r\nand put in operation a copper smelting and refining works, under the firm\r\nname of J. G. Hussey & Co., engaging at the same time in the produce\r\ncommission business, under the firm name of Hussey & Sinclair, which\r\nafterwards changed to Hussey & McBride. It is a matter of fact, on which\r\nMr. Hussey justly prides himself, and to which in great measure he\r\nattributes his success, that he confined himself strictly to the\r\nlegitimate conduct of his business as a commission dealer, never\r\nspeculating in produce when selling it for others.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, Mr. Hussey became interested in the discoveries of petroleum in\r\nthe creeks and valleys of Venango county, Pennsylvania. With his\r\ncharacteristic energy he went to the scene of the excitement just breaking\r\nout over the discoveries, and becoming satisfied of their importance, he\r\nimmediately commenced the work of exploration, in company with others, who\r\npurchased the McElhenny Farm, on which was struck the noted Empire well,\r\none of the most famous wells on Oil Creek, that by its extraordinary yield\r\nfirst added to the petroleum excitement, and then broke down the market by\r\na supply far in excess of the then demand. The tools were no sooner\r\nextracted than the oil rushed up in a torrent, equal to three thousand\r\nbarrels daily. The good fortune of the adventurers was disastrous. It was\r\nmore than they had bargained for, and was altogether too much of a good\r\nthing. The demand at that time was very limited, the uses to which\r\npetroleum had been applied being few, and science had not yet enabled it\r\nto be converted into the cheap and useful illuminator it has now become.\r\nOne day's flow of the Empire would supply all the demands of the United\r\nStates for a week. Barrels, too, were scarce, and when those at hand were\r\nfilled tanks were hastily improvised, but were speedily overflowed. Pits\r\nwere dug and rapidly filled, until at length the well owners, cursed with\r\ntoo much good luck, were compelled to turn the oil into the river. Then it\r\nrapidly fell in price, owing to the superabundant supply. It fell, in the\r\nautumn of 1861, to ten cents a barrel, and the oil interest was, for the\r\ntime, ruined.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture Mr. Hussey was induced to erect works for refining the\r\noil and preparing it as an illuminator. The first establishment was a\r\nsmall one, but as the demand increased and the oil interest revived, the\r\ncapacity was increased until it reached its present limit of from three\r\nhundred and fifty to four hundred barrels per day.\r\n\r\nWhen the second oil excitement broke out in 1864, Mr. Hussey was again one\r\nof the leading explorers and adventurers in the oil regions of\r\nPennsylvania. Successful wells were put down in Oil Creek and on the\r\nAllegheny river, and a large proportion of the product was brought to\r\nCleveland to be refined. His interest in this department of industry\r\nbecame so great and important, that after fifteen years of active\r\nconnection with the produce and copper smelting business of Cleveland, he\r\nsold out his interest in both the commission house and smelting works and\r\ndevoted his entire attention to oil.\r\n\r\nMr. Hussey is a good example of the success attending faithful,\r\nintelligent and conscientious attention to business. A self-made man, he\r\nnever lost sight of the fact that the same scrupulous honesty which gave\r\nhim success was necessary to retain it. Debt he looked upon as the road to\r\nruin, and he scrupulously shunned it. He never bought an article for\r\nhimself or his family on credit. His business paper was always good and\r\nnever was protested. His engagements were ever punctually kept. His two\r\ncardinal principles were \"Time is money,\" and \"Honesty is the best\r\npolicy,\" and these rules of action he carefully impressed on the young men\r\nwhom he brought up in business life. The value of his teachings and\r\nexample is shown in the fact that those brought up under his business care\r\nduring the past twenty years have come to hold a place in the front rank\r\nof business men, and have, by their energy and integrity, accumulated\r\ncompetence, and even affluence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, A. B. Stone]\r\n\r\n\r\nA. B. Stone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndros B. Stone was born in the town of Charlton, Worcester county,\r\nMassachusetts, June 18, 1824. He is the youngest son of Mr. Amasa Stone,\r\n(now a hale, old man, ninety years of age, in possession of all his\r\nfaculties,) and brother of A. Stone, Jr., whose biography has been\r\nsketched in an earlier portion of this work. Mr. Stone's boyhood was\r\nspent in the various occupations of country farm life, where he received\r\nin common with other boys the advantages of a public school education. In\r\nhis sixteenth year he left home to try the world for himself, and for a\r\nyear and a half worked industriously at the carpenter's trade with his\r\nelder brother, to whom he was apprenticed for four years, to receive\r\nthirty-five dollars the first year, forty the second, forty-five the\r\nthird, and fifty the fourth. An unconquerable desire for a better\r\neducation forced him to leave this occupation for a time, and enter an\r\nacademy, the expenses of which he met in part by teaching a public school\r\nin the winter season, and which left him only five dollars with which to\r\nmake another start in the world.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mr. Stone's brother, to whom he was apprenticed, had been\r\nemployed by Mr. Howe, the patentee of the \"Howe Bridge,\" and to Andros was\r\nassigned the keeping of the time of the workmen, and other similar duties,\r\ninstead of the more direct labors of the shop. In the autumn of 1842, Mr.\r\nHowe purchased Mr. Stone's unexpired time from his brother, advanced his\r\npay, and kept him in the same employment as time-keeper, and adding to\r\nthis duty that of making estimates, drawing bridge plans, etc., allowing\r\nhim in the winter an opportunity of increasing his finances by teaching\r\nschool. Subsequently, Mr. A. Boody and Mr. A. Stone, Jr., purchased the\r\nHowe Patent for building bridges in New England, and A. B. Stone, then\r\nabout nineteen years of age, made an engagement with the new firm. At\r\nfirst he was given the charge of a few men in framing and raising small\r\nbridges, but an opportunity soon occurred which enabled him to exhibit his\r\ncapabilities in a most advantageous light. Messrs. Boody and Stone were\r\nconstructing a bridge over the rapids of the Connecticut river at Windsor\r\nLocks, about fifteen hundred feet in length, in spans of one hundred and\r\neighty feet. One day the superintendent, who had the immediate charge of\r\nthe work, went to Mr. Stone and complained of being so ill that he was\r\nobliged to go home, and desired him to take temporary charge of the men.\r\nMr. Stone alleged his unfitness for the duty of taking charge of so many\r\nmen at the commencement of so important a work, but as the superintendent\r\nsaid he could not stay longer, Mr. Stone was compelled to assume the\r\nresponsibility, against his wishes.\r\n\r\nOn examining the condition of the work the cause of the superintendent's\r\nsevere illness was made manifest. The lower chords or stringers, of about\r\ntwo hundred and sixty feet in length, had been packed without being\r\nplaced opposite each other, one being placed several feet too far in one\r\ndirection, and the other about the same distance in the opposite\r\ndirection. Here was a dilemma and a difficulty, and an ability in the\r\nmind of the young mechanic to meet it, so that, in a very short time, the\r\nchords were properly adjusted. He then proceeded with the work, and in\r\nthree days had nearly completed the first span, when his brother paid a\r\nvisit of inspection to the bridge. Not finding the regular superintendent\r\nin charge, he naturally inquired the cause, and when the circumstances\r\nwere explained, examined the work very minutely. Without any comments\r\nupon what had been done, Mr. Stone left the place, leaving his younger\r\nbrother in charge, a tacit expression of confidence which was most\r\ngratifying, and gave him a self-confidence he had not previously\r\npossessed. About this time Mr. Stone was advanced to the general\r\nsuperintendence of construction, which position he retained between two\r\nand three years, when his brother admitted him as his partner in the\r\nconstruction of the bridges on the Atlantic & St. Lawrence railroad. A\r\nyear was successfully spent in the prosecution of this work, when a\r\npartnership was formed with Mr. A. Boody for constructing the bridges on\r\nthe Rutland & Burlington railroad in Vermont, which, although accompanied\r\nwith grave difficulties, resulted in success.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Mr. Stone extended the field of his operations by forming a new\r\npartnership with Mr. Maxwell, and purchasing the Howe Patent for building\r\nbridges in the three northern New England States. For two years this field\r\nwas profitably and creditably filled, when, dazzled by the ample resources\r\nof the West, New England was abandoned for Illinois. Here another\r\npartnership was formed, with his brother-in-law, Mr. Boomer, and under the\r\nstimulating effect of an undeveloped country, the new firm of Stone &\r\nBoomer soon took a high and honorable rank throughout the entire Western\r\nStates. The total amount of bridging built by this firm from 1852 to 1858\r\nwas not less than thirty thousand feet. They constructed the first bridge\r\nacross the Mississippi river, the longest span of a wooden truss that had\r\nup to that time ever been built. This was done under the most trying\r\ncircumstances, the thermometer at times marking 30 degrees below zero. The\r\nlongest draw-bridge of its period was also erected by this firm across the\r\nIllinois river, it having a length of two hundred and ninety-two feet, the\r\nwhole structure revolving on its centre, and capable of being opened by\r\none man in one and one-half minutes. During this time they built the roof\r\nof the Union Passenger House, in Chicago, which was of longer span than\r\nhad hitherto been built. The organization for the carrying on of their\r\nwork was so complete, that it was a common remark among the engineers of\r\nwestern railroads, \"If we want any bridges put up on short notice, we can\r\nget them of Stone & Boomer; they have them laid up on shelves, ready for\r\nerection!\" In connection with their bridge business the firm carried on\r\nthe manufacture of railroad cars.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1858, Mr. Stone gave up his home and business in Chicago\r\nfor his present residence in Cleveland and his present business as an iron\r\nmanufacturer. After carefully investigating the advantages which Cleveland\r\nafforded for such a purpose, and realizing the present and prospective\r\ndemands for an increased development for the manufacture of iron, Mr.\r\nStone availed himself of the opportunity of identifying his interests with\r\nthat of the firm of Chisholm & Jones, who at that time had just put in\r\noperation a small mill in Newburg. Here at once opened a new and\r\ndelightful opportunity for Mr. Stone to develope his natural love for the\r\nmechanical arts. To manufacture iron required knowledge--was a science,\r\nand to be master of his business was both his duty and his pride, and\r\nclaimed all his unflagging energy, his undaunted courage and\r\ndetermination. Thus the small mill at Newburg grew from the capacity of\r\nturning out thirty tons of re-rolled rails to its present capacity of\r\nsixty tons, beside the addition of a puddling mill, a merchant bar mill, a\r\nwire rod mill, two blast furnaces, spike, nut and bolt works. In the\r\nmeantime the small beginning had grown into such large proportions, and so\r\nmany railroad corporations had centered here, that it was thought best to\r\nform the same into a stock company, embracing another rolling mill on the\r\nlake shore, within the city limits. This was done, Mr. Stone filling the\r\noffice of President of the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company. In 1868, the\r\nCompany put into successful operation extensive steel works which they\r\nhad been engaged in erecting with great care and expense for nearly two\r\nyears. During that time Mr. Stone had made two visits to Europe for more\r\nthorough investigation into the process of making Bessemer steel, and the\r\nsuccess of this undertaking so far has been admitted by all who have\r\nvisited the works to be without parallel in the American manufacture of\r\nsteel. In addition to this heavy and extended business, Mr. Stone is\r\npresident of another rolling mill company in Chicago, in which he is\r\nlargely interested, also of a large coal mining company in Indiana, and\r\nvice President of a large iron manufacturing company at Harmony, Indiana,\r\nalso president of the American Sheet and Boiler Plate Company.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone is eminently known, and justly so, as a mechanic, and is widely\r\nknown as a man who crowns his thoughts with his acts. Still in the prime\r\nof manhood, he stands connected with manufacturing interests, furnishing\r\nemployment to thousands of men, all of which has been the outgrowth of\r\nscarcely more than ten years. This eminent success has not been the result\r\nof speculation, or of luck, but the legitimate end of his own hands and\r\nbrain. Neither can it be said he has had no reverses. At one time the\r\nfailure of railroad companies left him, not only penniless, but fifty\r\nthousand dollars in debt. With an indomitable will he determined to\r\nliquidate that debt, and how well he succeeded need not be told. Mr. Stone\r\nat present stands at the head of iron manufacturing companies, second to\r\nnone in the country, possessing almost unlimited credit. This\r\nextraordinary success has by no means affected Mr. Stone's modest nature\r\nfor which he is so noted. Gentlemanly and affable in his intercourse with\r\nall ranks and conditions of men, he has won universal respect, and an\r\nenviable position in the business interests of our country.\r\n\r\nMr. Stone was married in 1846 to Miss M. Amelia Boomer, daughter of Rev.\r\nJ. B. Boomer, of Worcester, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours truly, Henry Chisholm]\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Chisholm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry Chisholm is of Scotch origin, having been born in Lochgelly in\r\nFifeshire, April 27, 1822. There, as in New England, children, if they are\r\nheirs to nothing else, inherit the privilege of some early education. When\r\nhe was at the age of ten his father died. At the age of twelve, Henry's\r\neducation was finished and he was apprenticed to a carpenter, serving in\r\nan adjoining city five years, at the expiration of which time he went to\r\nGlasgow, as a journeyman. Whilst in Glasgow, he married Miss Jane Allen,\r\nof Dunfermline.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, he resolved to quit his native land and seek his fortune in the\r\nWest. Landing in Montreal, in April, he found employment as a journeyman\r\ncarpenter, working at his trade for two years. He then undertook contracts\r\non his own account, relying wholly on his own resources for their\r\nexecution, and all his undertakings proved successful. In 1850, he entered\r\ninto partnership with a friend to build the breakwater for the Cleveland\r\nand Pittsburgh Railroad, at Cleveland, the work occupying three years.\r\nThis, and other similar contracts, such as building piers and depots at\r\nCleveland, employed his time and energies until his commencement of the\r\niron business at Newburg, as one of the firm of Chisholm, Jones & Co. This\r\ncompany, and its business, have developed into the Cleveland Rolling Mill\r\nCompany of Cleveland, with two rail mills, making a hundred tons of rails\r\nand twenty-five tons of merchant iron per day; two blast furnaces, turning\r\nout forty tons of pig iron daily, and a Bessemer steel works,\r\nmanufacturing thirty tons of steel per day. Besides these, have been\r\nestablished the Union Rolling Mills of Chicago, making seventy tons of\r\nrails per day; of this extensive establishment Mr. Chisholm's son,\r\nWilliam, is manager. There are also two blast furnaces and a rolling mill\r\nin Indiana, making forty tons of iron per day. Fifteen hundred acres of\r\ncoal land are owned in connection with these works. Of all these\r\nenterprises Mr. Chisholm has been one of the leading managers, and remains\r\nlargely interested, his perseverence and energy aiding materially to crown\r\nthe undertakings, up to the present time, with the greatest success.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a business so large, the social and religions duties of\r\nMr. Chisholm have not been neglected. He is a zealous and liberal member\r\nof the Second Baptist church. For more than twenty-three years himself and\r\nwife have been professors of religion, and their five surviving children,\r\nthe oldest of whom is now twenty-six years old, have become members of the\r\nsame church.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Scotch boy and his success in America should be read by\r\nthe youth of England and Scotland, as an example for them to follow. In\r\nthese and other European countries such a career would be almost, if not\r\nquite, impossible. Mr. Chisholm has not been made proud by success, but\r\nretains the affability and simplicity of his early days. He has still a\r\nhearty physical constitution, with the prospect of a long life in which to\r\nenjoy, in the retired and quiet manner most agreeable to his tastes, the\r\ngood fortune of this world, and the respect of his employees, and\r\nneighbors and friends, which he values more highly than money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR. P. Myers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nR. P. Myers was born in Schodack, Rensselaer county, New York, January 1,\r\n1820. When between two and three years of age, his parents moved to Sand\r\nLake, in the same county. His father died May 14, 1823, leaving but very\r\nlimited means for the support of the widowed mother and three young\r\nchildren; and it is to the prayers, counsels and Christian influence of\r\nhis mother Mr. Myers is largely indebted for the direction of his life. At\r\nthe age of fifteen he left school and became clerk in a village store, but\r\nafter one year, being dissatisfied with the business prospects of the\r\nvillage, he obtained a situation in a dry goods store in Albany.\r\n\r\nIn 1842, he commenced business in Albany in the same line, with but two\r\nhundred and twenty-five dollars and a good character, for his capital,\r\nunder the firm name of Allen & Myers, continuing thus about two years. At\r\nthe end of that time, believing the West offered greater inducements to\r\nyoung men of small means, he removed to Ohio. His partner had previously\r\nmade a tour of observation through the West and become favorably impressed\r\nwith the business prospects of Akron, Ohio, which was at that time\r\nattracting considerable attention. Mr. Myers, in company with his wife,\r\npassed through Cleveland May 3d, 1844, (being the first anniversary of\r\ntheir wedding,) on their way to Akron. There he conducted his old business\r\nunder the same name as at Albany, for about one year, and then formed a\r\ncompany for the manufacture of stoves, under the style of Myers, Cobb &\r\nCo., his former partner being the \"Co.\" To this business he gave his\r\npersonal attention. The dry goods business was discontinued about a year\r\nafter engaging in the manufacture of stoves. In addition to this Mr. Myers\r\nbecame interested in the manufacture of woolen and cotton machinery,\r\nmachine cards, &c., the name of the firm being Allen, Hale & Co. This was\r\ndeveloped into a flourishing business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Respectfully yours, R. P. Myers]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, he was instrumental in the formation of the Akron Stove Company,\r\ninto which the firm of Myers, Cobb & Co. merged. At the first meeting of\r\nthe stockholders Mr. Myers was chosen general agent, in which position he\r\nremained with signal profit to the stockholders, until February 1st, 1859.\r\nThis, though a small company, was one of the most successful stock\r\ncompanies ever formed in this part of the country. Business continued to\r\nexpand, causing the company to enlarge its facilities for manufacturing\r\nfrom time to time, and their products were sold through Ohio, Michigan,\r\nIndiana, and other Western States. The fact that the stock at the time he\r\nretired from the company sold for from four hundred to five hundred per\r\ncent, above par value, after declaring liberal dividends from time to\r\ntime, speaks more plainly of its unparalleled success than anything we can\r\nsay, and is the best compliment that could be paid to the energy,\r\nenterprise and business capacity of its retiring manager.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, the stove business required his whole attention, and the\r\nmachine branch was sold out to one of the other partners; he then bent all\r\nhis energies to the invention and perfection of the stoves, and the\r\nvigorous prosecution of the business of the company. After conducting the\r\nbusiness of the company ten years, he felt the want of a larger field for\r\nenterprise, cast around for the most eligible situation, and finally\r\nconcluded that Cleveland was destined to be a great stove centre.\r\nResigning the management of the company February 1st, 1859, but retaining\r\nmost of his interest, he came to Cleveland and started an individual\r\nmanufactory, at the same time connecting with the stove business the\r\nwholesaling of tin plate, sheet iron, &c., which was conducted with such\r\nenergy that a large trade was attracted to Cleveland that had previously\r\nbeen given to other markets.\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of business, the demand upon his time in the\r\nmanufacturing department, and the need of extended facilities induced Mr.\r\nMyers to associate with him Messrs. B. F. Rouse and James M. Osborn, who\r\nnow form the firm of Myers, Rouse & Co. Since the present firm has existed\r\nthey have built a new foundry, of large capacity, with all the modern\r\nimprovements, on West River street, which is now taxed to its full\r\ncapacity to meet the wants of their trade.\r\n\r\nThe increase of the stove manufacturing of the city is estimated to have\r\nbeen full four hundred per cent. in ten years, and has fully justified\r\nMr. Myers' estimate of the natural advantages of Cleveland as a\r\nmanufacturing point.\r\n\r\nThis firm has patented a variety of new stoves that have become very\r\npopular, and hence remunerative, among which are the Eclipse, in 1850,\r\nsoon followed by the Golden Rule and Benefactor, the last named having\r\nobtained a most remarkable sale, and the name itself become a household\r\nword throughout the country, and, in 1868, the celebrated Princess stove.\r\n\r\nOf course, close attention to the wants of the country in this\r\ndirection for about one quarter of a century, has given Mr. Myers a\r\nvery valuable experience, which he is continually turning to account to\r\nthe benefit of the public and his own enrichment. The shipments of this\r\nfirm are to nearly all the markets in the northwest, reaching Council\r\nBluffs and Omaha.\r\n\r\nMr. Myers is now numbered among the most successful business men of the\r\ncity, and his success has been achieved in a department that has added\r\nvery materially to the progress of the city. The large number of men\r\nemployed, and the still larger number put into requisition in the\r\nproduction of the material required for the uses of the manufactory, and\r\nto supply the needs of the men, have added to the population and wealth of\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nAlthough so much engrossed in business since coming to Cleveland, Mr.\r\nMyers has found time to be active in many benevolent movements. For thirty\r\nyears he has been a useful member of the Baptist church. His Christian\r\nlabors have been generously given to the Sunday schools and mission work,\r\nand he is at this time superintendent of the First Baptist church Sunday\r\nschool of this city.\r\n\r\nMr. Myers is now forty-nine years old, with a vigorous physical\r\nconstitution and strong mind, that give promise of very many years of\r\nusefulness still to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. C. Younglove\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1837 to 1842, when specie payments were resumed, Cleveland saw her\r\ngreatest financial embarrassments; but from the latter year, a new and\r\nmore promising era dawned upon her. The land speculator gave place to the\r\nbusiness man, and for many years immediately following, her progress,\r\nthough slow, was sure and steady. During these years of depression many\r\nyoung and enterprising men settled here, who were, of course, untrammeled\r\nby old speculating debts, and their business habits were untainted by the\r\nloose recklessness of the land speculator. Many of these young men are now\r\nto be found among our most substantial, successful and enterprising\r\ncitizens, and the gentleman whose name stands at the head of this article\r\nis one of that number.\r\n\r\nMr. Younglove was born in Cambridge, Washington county, New York. His\r\nimmediate ancestors on both sides having been officers in the\r\nRevolutionary army, gives him a good title to native citizenship. His\r\nfather died before his birth, leaving him sufficient property for all\r\neducational purposes, but none to commence business with. He first essayed\r\na professional life, and with that view began the study of law, but soon\r\ndiscovered that a sedentary occupation was uncongenial to him, and\r\nabandoned the profession.\r\n\r\nHis first business connection, which was formed before his majority, was\r\nwith an uncle in his native county. But finding the country village of his\r\nnativity too slow for a sanguine and active temperament, he determined to\r\ntry his fortune in the then comparatively unknown West, and in August,\r\n1836, came to Cleveland. After a clerkship of eight months in a dry goods\r\nstore, he bought an interest in a book store, and in a few months\r\nthereafter bought out his partner and added job and news printing, and\r\nbook publishing, to his other business. At this time he introduced the\r\nfirst power press into Cleveland--and it is believed the second that was\r\nrun west of the Alleghenies--on which he printed for a long time the daily\r\npapers of the city.\r\n\r\nIn 1848, in connection with Mr. John Hoyt, he built the Cleveland Paper\r\nMill; the first having steam power west of the mountains, and the first of\r\nany importance in the United States. This innovation on the old mode of\r\nobtaining power for such machinery, called out many prophecies of failure.\r\nBut these gentlemen not only made their business a success, but\r\ndemonstrated to Cleveland, that she had, in her proximity to the coal\r\nfields, and in the steam engine, facilities for manufacturing unsurpassed\r\nby the best water power in the country--a hint which she has not been slow\r\nto improve upon.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Younglove & Hoyt finally united their business with that of the\r\nLake Erie Paper Company, under the name of the Cleveland Paper Company, of\r\nwhich latter company Mr. Younglove was elected president, and continued in\r\nthe chief management of its business until the Spring of 1867, when he\r\nsold his entire interest, leaving the company with a capital of three\r\nhundred thousand dollars, and one of the most prosperous paper\r\nmanufacturing companies in the country.\r\n\r\nMr. Younglove was one of the first of our citizens to perceive the\r\nimportance and necessity of a gas company for Cleveland. Learning that a\r\ncharter had been obtained by some of our wealthy men, and was laying\r\ndormant in their hands, he, with some associates, bought it up and\r\nproceeded to the erection of the works--himself being one of the\r\ndirectors. Few, however, know the struggles and discouragements which\r\nthese directors encountered in their efforts to furnish the citizens of\r\nCleveland with one of the greatest conveniences and luxuries of\r\ncivilized life. The stock could not be sold here. Aside from that taken\r\nby Mr. Younglove, only five hundred dollars were subscribed by the\r\ncitizens, and distributed as follows: James Kellogg, four hundred\r\ndollars, and J. W. Allen, one hundred dollars; and this was subsequently\r\nall taken off the hands of the subscribers by Mr. Younglove before it\r\nwas paid up. But the directors, well persuaded of the value and\r\nimportance of the work they had in hand, were in no way discouraged, but\r\npushed on the work till all present funds were exhausted and not a\r\ndollar was left in the treasury to meet the demands of the next\r\nSaturday's pay roll. At this juncture, the Board had a consultation,\r\nwhich may be fitly termed an \"anxious meeting.\" The question arose,\r\n\"What is to be done?\" and in answer, each member determined to take such\r\nan amount of stock as he could either pay for or sell. Mr. Younglove\r\ntook five thousand dollars, and determined to make another attempt to\r\nsell to the wealthy men of the city, but after four days of industrious\r\neffort he had not one dollar of subscription to reward his labor. Mr.\r\nP. M. Weddell was the only one who gave any encouragement--\"He might take\r\na few hundred dollars at seventy-five per cent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this failure, Mr. Younglove mortgaged his lot on Euclid avenue,\r\nwhere he now lives, and paid up his subscription, thus fulfilling his\r\npromise to his associates, and placing himself on record as the _only_\r\ncitizen who would help to supply the city with gas.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Mr. Younglove, associated with Mr. Dudley Baldwin, bought of\r\nHowell & Dewitt their machinery for manufacturing agricultural implements.\r\nThis establishment was immediately enlarged to do an extensive business.\r\nMr. Baldwin subsequently sold his interest to his partner, who still\r\nretains his interest in the business, it being at present one of the\r\nlargest and most reputable manufactories in the city.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this has authority for saying, that Mr. Younglove looks upon\r\nhis connection with the Society for Savings in this city, from its\r\norganization, as one of the most honorable and reputable of his business\r\nlife. It is an association purely benevolent in its objects and action,\r\nmanaged by men who have no hope or desire of pecuniary benefit, with\r\nmatured judgment and an abnegation of self that may well secure for it the\r\nutmost confidence--as it most happily has--of the laboring poor and the\r\nhelpless, for whose benefit it is maintained.\r\n\r\nMr. Younglove is one of the most enterprising and intelligent business\r\nmen. Having a natural talent for mechanics, he has done much to inaugurate\r\nand encourage the manufactures of our city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn D. Rockefeller.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough yet quite a young man, John D. Rockefeller occupies in our\r\nbusiness circles a position second to but few. He began life with few\r\nadvantages, save that of honesty of purpose and unflinching morality, and\r\na determination to succeed, if unremitting effort would secure that end.\r\nHe, in connection with M. B. Clark, commenced the produce and commission\r\nbusiness on the dock, with a small capital saved from earnings. For a time\r\ntheir profits were exceedingly small, but the firm soon gained the\r\nconfidence of our citizens and bankers, and at the end of the first year\r\nthey had done business to the amount of $450,000. Each successive year\r\nadded to their business, and in the fourth, it amounted to something like\r\n$1,200,000, the average being, perhaps, about $700,000.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1863, Mr. Rockefeller engaged in the oil refining\r\nbusiness, commencing with a capacity of forty-five barrels of crude oil\r\nper day, and gradually increased it until 1865, when the capacity of his\r\nworks was a hundred and fifty barrels per day. At this time he sold his\r\ninterest in the commission business, and devoted his whole attention to\r\nthe oil refining. Every year witnessed an enlargement of his works, and\r\nfor the last three years it is believed that his has been the largest of\r\nits kind in the world, the present capacity being twenty-five hundred\r\nbarrels of crude oil per day. The growth of the business, dating back to\r\n1865, was such that it became necessary to establish a house in New York\r\nfor the disposition of their oil, where they now have warehouses of their\r\nown, and sell and take care of their property.\r\n\r\nThe effect of such works as those of Mr. Rockefeller in the city may be\r\nimagined when we say that there are about one hundred men regularly\r\nemployed in them, besides a force of some fifteen or twenty teams and\r\nteamsters. To these must be added from seven hundred to eight hundred\r\nmen around the city employed in making barrels for the oil, and from\r\n$20,000 to $25,000 per year expended among plumbers and various other\r\nmechanics for repairs. The enlargements of their works this year will\r\ncost near $40,000.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller never retrogrades; he has always advanced from the\r\ncommencement. Close application to one kind of business, an avoidance of\r\nall positions of an honorary character that cost time, and strict business\r\nhabits, have resulted in the success, the fruits of which he now enjoys.\r\nHe has worked himself, and kept everything pertaining to his business in\r\nso methodical a manner that he knows every night how he stands with the\r\nworld. He was drilled to strict economy as an accountant during hard\r\ntimes, before his own business history, and he has rigidly adhered to the\r\nprinciples then learnt.\r\n\r\nHe has frequently been so situated as to choose between his own judgment\r\nand that of older heads, and where he has followed his own opinions in\r\nopposition to others of more experience he has seen no reason to regret\r\nhis choice. The result of his course has been, that, though still young,\r\nhe stands at the head of one of the most extensive business establishments\r\nin the city, and is possessed of wealth sufficient to secure a comfortable\r\nmaintainance, and a provision against the ordinary mishaps of business.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockefeller is a valued member of the Second Baptist church\r\nhaving long been a sincere believer in the faith and practice of the\r\nBaptist church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fraternally Yours, Peter Thatcher]\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Thatcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Thatcher derives his descent in a direct line from the Reverend\r\nThomas Thatcher, the first minister of the Old South Church, in Boston,\r\nwho at the age of twelve years left England with his uncle Anthony, and\r\narrived in New England in 1635.\r\n\r\nPeter Thatcher was born in Attleboro, Massachusetts, July 20, 1812. At the\r\nage of nineteen, not liking his father's business of farming, he announced\r\nhis intention of seeking other means of livelihood, and, sorely against\r\nhis father's wish, he set out in search of fortune. Two days after leaving\r\nhis father's roof, he found employment with a house-carpenter, in Taunton,\r\nMassachusetts, to whom he engaged himself to work one year for forty\r\ndollars and board. After two years service in this employ he, in November,\r\n1834, commenced work on the Boston and Providence Railroad, laying track,\r\nin the employ of Messrs. Otis & Co. His industry and ability attracted the\r\nattention of his employers, and he was retained and promoted by them,\r\nremaining in the employ of the firm and their successors, railroad\r\nbuilding, until 1850, with the exception of three years spent on Fort\r\nWarren and Fort Independence, in Boston Harbor, where he superintended the\r\nwork of construction under the supervision of Colonel Sylvanus Thayer.\r\nDuring his career as a railroad builder he was engaged on the principal\r\nrailroads on the sea-coast from Maine to Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, the firm of Thatcher, Stone & Co. was formed, for the purpose of\r\nbuilding bridges, both in the eastern and western States, an office being\r\nopened in Springfield for the former, and another in Cleveland for the\r\nlatter. In 1851, this firm was dissolved and that of Thatcher, Burt & Co.\r\nformed. The patent for building the Howe Truss Bridge in the States of\r\nOhio, Indiana, Kentucky and Michigan was purchased, and nearly all the\r\noriginal railroad bridges in Ohio, with the depots and engine houses,\r\ntogether with many in other States, were built by this firm.\r\n\r\nAfter having for thirteen years carried on the bridge building business,\r\nand added to it a trade in lumber, the firm built the Union Elevator, in\r\nCleveland, and the new firm of Thatcher, Gardner, Burt & Co., commission\r\nmerchants and produce dealers, was formed. This firm was dissolved in\r\n1865, by the withdrawal of Mr. Thatcher.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a company was formed for the purchase of a patent obtained\r\nfor the manufacture of a durable paint and fire-proof mastic from prepared\r\niron ore. Mr. Thatcher was chosen president of the company which at once\r\nentered on a vigorous prosecution of its business and has succeeded beyond\r\nthe anticipation of its projectors. The paint is made of Lake Superior\r\niron ore, ground fine and mixed with linseed oil, with which it forms a\r\nperfect union. It is then used in a thin state as a paint for surfaces,\r\nwhether of wood stone or metal, exposed to the weather, and in a thicker\r\nstate for a fire-proof mastic. The ore is crushed with machinery of great\r\nstrength, and about three tons of the paint are produced daily, besides\r\nthe mastic, and find ready market.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the above Mr. Thatcher has recently purchased a patent,\r\nobtained by Mr. Ward, for the manufacture of \"Metallic Shingle Roofing,\"\r\nwhich is now being perfected and introduced to the public, and which, its\r\ninventor claims, will supercede all methods of roofing now in use for\r\ncheapness, durability, weight and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nMr. Thatcher has long been identified with the Masonic order, and has\r\nfilled high positions in that body. He is Past M. of Iris Lodge of\r\nCleveland, Past H. P. of Webb Chapter, has been Treasurer of Iris Lodge for\r\nten years, Past D. G. H. P. of the Grand Chapter of Ohio, and is now Grand\r\nTreasurer of the Grand Commandery of Knights Templar of Ohio, which\r\nposition he has held six years.\r\n\r\nMr. Thatcher is a genial, whole-souled man, having a host of warm friends,\r\nand has enjoyed the respect and confidence of all with whom he has been\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. C. Scofield,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. C. Scofield was born near Wakefield, England, October 25, 1821, and\r\nspent the earlier years of his life in Leeds, where he was employed on\r\nmachine work until his twenty-first year, when he determined to emigrate\r\nto the Western continent to seek his fortune. On reaching America he found\r\nhis way westward until he arrived at Chagrin river in Cuyahoga county,\r\nwhere he found employment with a Mr. Waite, at eight dollars a month,\r\nworking one year at this rate. The next two years were spent in the brick\r\nyard of A. W. Duty. Following this, he was for two years turnkey under\r\nsheriff Beebe, and then established himself in a brick yard of his own on\r\nthe west side of the river. One Summer's work in this experiment gave him\r\na start in business life, and laid the foundation, small though it was, of\r\nhis after prosperity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Respectfully, W. C. Scofield]\r\n\r\nAfter his experiment in the brick making business, he undertook the\r\ncharge of the lard oil and saleratus works owned by Mr. C. A. Dean.\r\nAfter three years, Messrs. Stanley, Wick & Camp bought the\r\nestablishment; and shortly after this change, Mr. Scofield purchased\r\nthe interest of Mr. Wick, and after a few months Mr. Camp sold his\r\ninterest to the remaining partners, who carried on the business until\r\n1857. At that time Mr. Scofield purchased the interest of his partners\r\nand became sole owner of the whole concern and carried on business in\r\nthis way for the next five years.\r\n\r\nIn 1861, he added to his lard oil and saleratus business that of refining\r\noil, associating himself in this enterprise with Messrs. Halle and\r\nFawcett. Their refinery was built on the site of the City Forge works, and\r\nthe capacity of the works was limited to two eight barrel stills.\r\nSubsequently this land was sold for other purposes and the refinery was\r\nclosed, after a very successful career. Previous to that event the firm\r\nbuilt an oil refinery on Oil Creek, with a capacity of about forty\r\nbarrels. This is still in operation under the firm name of Lowry, Fawcett\r\n& Co., turning out about sixty barrels of refined oil daily, and proving\r\nfrom its start a continual success. In 1865, Mr. Scofield became\r\ninterested in the oil refining firm of Critchley, Fawcett & Co., in which\r\nhe still retains his interest, and which is in successful operation, with\r\na yield of about one hundred barrels per day. About the same time he\r\nbecame a partner in an oil commission business in New York, established\r\nunder the name of Hewitt & Scofield, which has also proved a success. He\r\nis also interested in the Cleveland Chemical Works, being vice president\r\nof the company, which is doing a heavy business. The extent and importance\r\nof the works may be inferred from the fact, that the buildings\r\nnecessitated an outlay of a hundred and sixty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, the firm of Alexander, Scofield & Co., was formed, and commenced\r\noperation on the site of the present works, at the junction of the\r\nAtlantic & Great Western Railway with Liberty street. The works were\r\ncommenced with a capacity of fifty barrels daily, and gradually enlarged,\r\nuntil the capacity now reaches six hundred barrels daily.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of Mr. Scofield's business career, with the extensive\r\noperations of the firms in which he is interested, there has been but one\r\ncase of litigation. This is noteworthy, and speaks well for the integrity\r\nand strict business habits of Mr. Scofield. He is not given to jumping\r\nhastily at conclusions or embarking wildly in business schemes. Before\r\nentering on an undertaking, he carefully, though rapidly, studies the\r\nnatural effect of the step and having satisfied himself of its probable\r\nsuccess, he prosecutes it with unflagging energy. The course of events\r\nwithin the past few years offered unusual opportunities for a clear headed\r\nand active business man to advance himself, and Mr. Scofield had the\r\nforethought and energy to take advantage of those opportunities. From\r\nfirst to last he had to depend on his own energies, having been left an\r\norphan at sixteen years of age, and from the time of his reaching his\r\nmajority, being compelled to push his way unaided, a stranger in a strange\r\nland. The efforts of just such men have made Cleveland what it is to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevi Haldeman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLevi Haldeman is a representative of another class of our citizens than\r\nrefiners, who have taken advantage of the petroleum enterprise, and are\r\nspending their money in building up the prosperity of the city, turning\r\nits energies into channels that cannot fail to give an impetus to all\r\nbranches of trade, and aid in establishing our financial institutions on a\r\nbasis of unrivalled strength, and who, at the same time, reap their reward\r\nby putting money into their own pockets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Respectfully + Truly, L. Haldeman]\r\n\r\nThe subject of this sketch was born in Chester county, Pennsylvania, Dec.\r\n14, 1809, received a good common school education, and removed with his\r\nfather to Columbiana county, Ohio, in 1819. Until he was about twenty-five\r\nyears of age he spent his time with his father on his farm, and in\r\nteaching school. He then commenced reading medicine with Drs. Robertson\r\nand Cary of that place; after which he attended lectures at Cincinnati,\r\nand was a private student of Drs. Gross and Parker--the former being now\r\nProfesser in Jefferson College, Philadelphia, and the latter Professor in\r\nthe College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York. Mr. Haldeman commenced\r\npractice alone in 1839, at Minerva, Ohio, although he had practiced from\r\n1837 with his old preceptor. He soon obtained an excellent practice in\r\nmedicine, and was noted for his skill in surgery, performing nearly all\r\nthe operations in that part of the country, among them tractreotomy, or\r\nopening the windpipe and extracting foreign matter from it, and difficult\r\ncases of lithotomy.\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Mr. Haldeman, in connection with Messrs. Hussey and McBride, of\r\nCleveland, bought the McElhenny Farm, in the Pennsylvania oil regions,\r\nwhich proved to be very valuable. For the whole farm of two hundred acres\r\nthe sum of twenty thousand dollars was paid, subject to some leases, which\r\nwere renewed to the lessees. Mr. Funk leased a hundred and thirty acres of\r\nthe farm, subdivided it in into acre lots, and sub-lot them to a number of\r\noil companies, representing an aggregate capital of millions of dollars.\r\nMessrs. Bennet and Hatch, the sub-lessees of one sub-lot, struck the\r\nlargest producing well yet found in the oil region the Empire, a three\r\nthousand barrel well, which is estimated to have produced no less than six\r\nhundred thousand barrels of oil and the whole farm is estimated to have\r\nproduced two millions of barrels. At the present time the sub-leases have\r\nnearly all been forfeited, through breach of covenant, and the farm has\r\nreverted to the owners, Messrs. Hussey and Haldeman. It is not now worked,\r\nthe wells having been flooded by the unexpected influx of water, against\r\nwhich there had been no provision made by the owners of the wells. It is\r\nexpected to remedy this misfortune by plugging the wells below the water\r\nveins, and pumping, with the hope of thus restoring the value of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe next enterprise was the purchase of the A. Buchanan farm, of three\r\nhundred acres, in connection with others, subject, also, to a lease, but\r\ngiving the owners of the farm a royalty of one sixth of the oil produced,\r\nfree of cost, and retaining the use of the land for other purposes. On\r\nthis farm the town of Rouseville has been built since the purchase. This\r\nhas proved a very lucrative investment. The first well struck on it in\r\n1860 is still producing. In company with others, Mr. Haldeman also bought\r\nthe royalty of the John McClintock farm for ten thousand dollars in gold,\r\nthe Irishman owning it thinking nothing but gold worth having. Mr.\r\nHaldeman sold his thirty-second part of the same for a hundred thousand\r\ndollars; another partner sold his for forty-thousand dollars, the\r\npurchaser subsequently re-selling it for one hundred thousand dollars.\r\nBesides this, Mr. Haldeman became half owner of two hundred acres not yet\r\ndeveloped, and he and his sons own about four hundred acres, supposed to\r\nbe excellent oil land. He has also invested about forty thousand dollars\r\nin iron tanking, in the oil region, and has now tankage for four hundred\r\nthousand barrels, in connection with others.\r\n\r\nMr. Haldeman was married in 1840 to Miss Mary Ann Gaves, of Columbiana\r\ncounty. The oldest and second sons, L. P. and W. P. Haldeman, are engaged\r\nin business with their father, and by their energy, foresight, and close\r\nattention to business, have aided materially in the later successes of the\r\nfirm. Mr. Haldeman has, as is evident from the record here given, won for\r\nhimself considerable wealth, but it has been secured only by the exercise\r\nof sound judgment and intelligent enterprise, which deserves, though it\r\ndoes not always achieve, success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG. Westlake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe firm of Westlake, Hutchins & Co., composed of G. Westlake, H. A.\r\nHutchins, C. H. Andrews and W. C. Andrews, stands high among the oil\r\nrefining establishments of Cleveland, not only for the extent of their\r\noperations but for their fair dealing in business matters. The firm\r\ncommenced the erection of their works in October, 1866, and in June of the\r\nsucceeding year began operations with a capacity of two hundred barrels of\r\ncrude oil per day. The business improved, and the works had to be enlarged\r\nto keep pace with it, until the present capacity of the works is seven\r\nhundred and fifty barrels per day. In the enlargements, the latest\r\nimprovements in the appliances for the refining of oil have been put in.\r\nOne still now employed has a capacity of eleven hundred barrels, which is\r\ncharged twice a week, and was the first of the kind in the State. Besides\r\nthis are ten stills of thirty barrels each, one of two hundred and fifty\r\nbarrels, and one, recently completed, forty feet in diameter, of the same\r\npattern as the monster still just mentioned, and which is calculated for\r\ntwo thousand barrels. The total capacity of the works, including this\r\nstill, is fourteen hundred and sixteen barrels of crude per day, which\r\nwill yield, if running to full capacity, two hundred and eighty-eight\r\nthousand barrels of refined oil in a year, or between three and four\r\nmillions of dollars in value at the stills. Connected with the works are a\r\ntwenty thousand barrel tank, a fifteen thousand barrel tank, two of ten\r\nthousand barrels each, one of six thousand barrels, and several from two\r\nthousand barrels down. When all its improvements in progress are completed\r\nit will be one of the largest refineries in Cleveland and in the United\r\nStates, and with enterprise corresponding to the size and importance of\r\nits works. A large number of men are employed, either at the works or in\r\ndirect connection with it by providing cooperage and other necessaries for\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\nMr. Westlake, the senior member of the firm, was born in Chemung county,\r\nNew York, January 11, 1822, received a good education and when a young man\r\nwas employed as a clerk in a lumber business for a couple of years. In\r\n1847, he went into the lumber trade on his own account, remaining in that\r\nbusiness until 1866, when he removed to Cleveland, and finding that the\r\noil refining business held out reasonable prospects of profit, he embarked\r\nin it, and by his energy of character and enterprise has achieved\r\nflattering success, although the time in which he has been engaged in the\r\nbusiness is short. He is still in the prime of life.\r\n\r\nMr. Westlake was married in 1848 to Miss Hatch, of Elmira, Chemung county,\r\nand has three children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Buhrer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStephen Buhrer, the subject of this sketch, is of immediate German\r\ndescent. His father, a native of Baden, and his mother of Wirtemburg,\r\nemigrated to this country in the year 1817. Their acquaintance was first\r\nformed on board of the emigrant ship on their passage hither, and they\r\nwere married soon after their arrival in this country. After remaining in\r\nthe State of Pennsylvania about two years, they came to make their home\r\nin Tuscarawas county, Ohio, where, on the 26th day of December, 1825,\r\ntheir son, Stephen Buhrer, was born. That region at that time (fifty\r\nyears ago) was remarkably wild and rough, and inhospitable, but since, by\r\nthe thrifty German population, by whom it was mainly inhabited, it has\r\nbecome scarcely inferior to any other part of the State in agricultural\r\nwealth. But the father of Stephen Buhrer was not destined to live to see\r\nthis prosperity. He died in the year 1829, leaving his widow and two\r\nyoung children, Stephen and Catharine, dependent on themselves to make\r\ntheir way in the world.\r\n\r\nFrom the severe discipline to which Mr. Buhrer was subjected in early\r\nlife, and from the difficulties which he had to overcome, he acquired that\r\nenergy and force of character which have given him success and by which he\r\nhas attained to a high rank as a self-made man.\r\n\r\nMr. Buhrer does not remember that he was privileged to attend any school\r\nafter he was ten years of age. All the education which he subsequently\r\nacquired he obtained on Sundays and in evenings, after his day's labor was\r\nover. He has been a citizen of Cleveland since the year 1844. His first\r\nbusiness in this city was at his trade, as cooper, and afterwards he\r\nbecame extensively engaged, and with success, in the business of purifying\r\nand refining spirits.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of the year 1853, he was elected a member of the City\r\nCouncil, and was twice thereafter re-elected to the same office, the last\r\ntime almost without opposition.\r\n\r\nBy the manner in which he discharged his duty as a member of the City\r\nCouncil, public attention was directed toward him as a suitable person for\r\nthe responsible office of Mayor of the city, to which he was elected, at\r\nthe April election, in the year 1867, by a very large majority, although\r\nhe did not belong to the dominant political party. It is conceded by all\r\nthat he has discharged the duties of Mayor, with a zeal and a devotion to\r\nthe interests of the city which have had few examples. Turning aside, on\r\nhis election, from the business in which he was engaged, he has allowed\r\nthe affairs of the city to monopolize his attention. Placed by his office\r\nat the head of the Board of City Improvements, and having in charge public\r\nworks of great magnitude, involving the expenditure of vast sums of money,\r\ninvested with the sole control and management of the large police force of\r\nthe city, and therefore made responsible for its fidelity and efficiency,\r\nand exercising a supervision over all the departments of the city\r\ngovernment, to promote economy and to lessen taxation, Mayor Buhrer has\r\nfound his office to be no sinecure. Among the distinguishing traits of his\r\nofficial conduct has been his impartiality, his exemption from favoritism\r\nand partizanship, when in conflict with the public interests, and\r\nespecially his well-known hostility to \"cliques\" and \"rings,\" such as\r\nresort to a city government as a rich placer, where they may work to\r\nenrich themselves at the expense of the people. The rigid discharge of\r\nduty which he has required of the police under his charge, and the\r\navoidance, at the same time, of everything like oppression, or the\r\nexercise of undue severity in office, have received the public\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Respectfully, Stephen Buhrer]\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent institutions of Cleveland will be the House of\r\nCorrection, now in progress of construction, and which is humanely\r\nintended to reform and reclaim, as well as to punish, the vicious and the\r\ncriminal. To Mr. Buhrer much credit will be awarded for the active and\r\nleading part he has taken in the establishment of such an institution.\r\n\r\nAt the expiration of his term of office, it was his wish to be relieved\r\nfrom public care and to devote all of his time to his private pursuits,\r\nand which, the more he expected to do, as no one of his predecessors had\r\never been re-elected, or had entered again upon a second term. But\r\nyielding to the solicitations of friends, he again became a candidate, and\r\nat the April election, in 1869, was again elected Mayor of the city of\r\nCleveland, by nearly three thousand majority. Such a demonstration by the\r\npeople is a sufficient commentary upon his character as a citizen, and\r\nupon the public estimation of his official services.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. B. Clark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nM. B. Clark was born in Malmsbury, England, September 6, 1827. From early\r\nboyhood until he was nearly of age he was employed in all the various\r\noccupations of an agricultural district. About this time the United\r\nStates, as a promising country for the working man, was attracting\r\nconsiderable notice in his native village, and young Clark, being\r\nfavorably impressed with reports from America, secretly resolved to\r\nhusband his means and follow the example of those who had recently gone.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1847, he left home with but barely sufficient means for\r\nthe expenses of the journey. On the 17th of June in that year he landed at\r\nBoston, amidst martial music and parade of military, celebrating the\r\nbattle of Bunker's Hill. This, however, was but poor consolation to the\r\nEnglish lad, who found himself penniless and friendless. He used every\r\neffort to find employment without success, and in the meantime was obliged\r\nto sleep wherever night overtook him. At last he obtained work on a farm,\r\nin the little town of Dover, Massachusetts, at ten dollars per month. He\r\nremained in this situation until October, when, with the regrets of his\r\nemployer, he left for the West.\r\n\r\nOn arriving in Ohio, he first obtained employment at chopping wood and\r\nteaming, in Lorain county. In the following Spring he returned to\r\nCleveland and obtained a situation as helper in a hardware store. Here it\r\nbecame apparent to him that he was sadly deficient in an educational point\r\nof view, and that it offered an almost insuperable barrier to his\r\nadvancement in life. To remedy this, so far as possible, he devoted all\r\nhis leisure hours to study, and on the establishment of the evening\r\nschools the following winter, he availed himself of them, and the\r\nadvantage soon became apparent.\r\n\r\nWith a view to the improvement of his circumstances, in 1851, he engaged\r\nhimself to Hussey & Sinclair, with whom he remained six years, when he\r\nreturned to his former employers, Otis & Co., and remained with them three\r\nyears longer.\r\n\r\nIn 1859, he established himself in the commission business, associating\r\nwith him John D. Rockefeller, the firm name being Clark & Rockefeller;\r\nboth young men of limited means. By strict attention and honorable conduct\r\nthey soon built up a lucrative business. In 1860, G. W. Gardner became a\r\nmember of the firm, and continued as such for two years, when he retired.\r\n\r\nIn 1863, Mr. Clark's attention was attracted to the manufacture of\r\npetroleum oils, a business then in its infancy. In connection with his\r\npartners, he erected a factory on the Newburg road, the capacity of which\r\nwas about fifty-six barrels of crude oil per day. They soon discovered\r\nthat there was money in the enterprise, and before the end of the year\r\nthey had increased the capacity of their works four-fold; and the\r\nenterprise of this firm has aided materially in making Cleveland what it\r\nis to-day, the successful rival of Pittsburgh in the manufacture of\r\npetroleum oils. In 1865, the manufacturing branch was purchased by his\r\npartner, and the general commission business was continued by Mr. Clark\r\nuntil 1866, when he sold out his interest, remaining nominally out of the\r\nbusiness until June of that year, when he wearied of idleness and sought\r\nactive business once more. Purchasing the controlling interest in another\r\nrefinery, he set to work, vigorously, enlarging the capacity of the works\r\nand bringing capital and energy to bear with such effect upon the business\r\nof the firm, that it now ranks among the leading oil refining\r\nestablishments of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Respectfully, M. B. Clark]\r\n\r\nMr. Clark has been no niggard with the wealth that has accrued to him\r\nfrom his business. During the war he contributed liberally and was active\r\nin aiding the cause of the government by giving every practical measure\r\nhis cordial and generous support. In other matters he has manifested a\r\nlike liberal spirit. In politics he has acted with the Republicans, and\r\nhas been active in furthering the success of that party. In 1866, he was\r\nelected member of the city council from the fourth ward, and was\r\nre-elected in 1868. In religions matters he has always connected himself\r\nwith the Wesleyan Methodists, and has been a leading supporter of that\r\ncongregation in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nStill in the vigor of life, Mr. Clark has the opportunity of doing much\r\nmore for the prosperity of the city by increasing the manufacturing\r\nbusiness, and this his practical nature leads him to do.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Mr. Clark has been the architect of his own\r\nfortune. His sympathies are with the industrial classes, from which he\r\nsprang, and in return he has the confidence and good will of a large\r\nportion of that class.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark was married in 1853, and has a family of five children.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Lowman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJacob Lowman was born in Washington county, Maryland, Sept. 22, 1810. He\r\nworked with his father on the farm until he was eighteen, at which time he\r\nbecame an apprentice to the smithing department of the carriage building\r\ntrade. At the expiration of his apprenticeship, in 1832, he came to Ohio.\r\nHe stopped in Stark county for a few months, and then came to Cleveland,\r\nin search of work, which he readily obtained, with Elisha Peet, on Seneca\r\nstreet, where Frankfort street now intersects it. He worked about a year\r\nand a half, for which he received nine dollars per month and board. Being\r\nof steady habits, he saved in that time about seventy-five dollars. Mr.\r\nLowman then bought out his employer, and commenced at once on his own\r\naccount, at the same place. After two years, he built a shop where the\r\nTheatre Comique now stands, and remained there eight years. At first he\r\nlabored alone, after awhile he had one journeyman, soon adding still\r\nanother, and another, till, at the end of the eight years, he employed\r\nabout fifteen men. He then removed to Vineyard street, having built shops\r\nthere to accommodate his increasing business. This was about the year\r\n1842--3. After moving to the new buildings, his business constantly grew\r\nwith the city, and more men were employed. In 1851, Mr. Lowman commenced\r\nthe erection of a still larger building to meet his increasing demands; he\r\nwas then employing from thirty-five to forty men. About this time too, he\r\nassociated with him Mr. Wm. M. Warden, who had then been in his employ for\r\nabout ten years. Their facilities were sufficient till about the time of\r\nthe war, when they erected a large brick building on Champlain street, now\r\noccupied as a smith shop, trimming shop, store room, etc., since which\r\nthey have employed about sixty men. Mr. Lowman, for a number of years, did\r\nlittle beside a local trade, but for the last five or six years he has\r\nbuilt up quite a large foreign trade, shipping West extensively--Wisconsin,\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Indiana and Kentucky, being\r\nthe principal markets.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowman has been strictly temperate all his life. He has taken a lively\r\ninterest in the Sunday schools of the city, in connection with the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church, of which he has been a member nearly since he\r\ncame to the city.\r\n\r\nHe was married in 1841 to Miss Minerva E. Peet, by whom he had four\r\nchildren, three of whom are now living--the oldest son being in business\r\nwith his father. He suffered the loss of his partner in life in 1857. He\r\nmarried again in 1863, to Mrs. Sarah D. Goodwin, of Lorain county, Ohio,\r\nformerly of Vermont.\r\n\r\nHe attributes his success in business to the fact that he had an object in\r\nview, and endeavored to attain it, strict attention to business, economy,\r\nand studying to give satisfaction by his work.\r\n\r\nHe is only fifty-eight years of age, and well preserved, and in all\r\nhuman probability will live to enjoy the fruit of his labor for many\r\nyears to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly W. G. Wilson]\r\n\r\n\r\nW. G. Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. G. Wilson, now president of the Wilson Sewing Machine Company of\r\nCleveland, was born in Franklin county, Pennsylvania, on the first of\r\nApril, 1841. His education was obtained at a village school house. When he\r\nwas in his thirteenth year his parents removed to Ohio, and the lad\r\nremained with them until his eighteenth year, when he left home with a\r\nsomewhat indefinite idea of doing something for himself, although\r\npossessing neither money nor friends to aid him in his start in life.\r\nUntil the year 1864, he wandered from place to place, turning his hand to\r\nvarious employments, but was dissatisfied with them all, being convinced\r\nthat he had not yet found his right vocation or location.\r\n\r\nIn 1864, he was visiting some friends at Madison county, Ohio, when his\r\nattention was attracted by a cheap sewing machine. Believing that money\r\ncould be made by the sale of such machines he purchased one, mastered its\r\nmode of operation, and took a traveling agency. Finding this a more\r\nprofitable business than any he had yet undertaken, he prosecuted it with\r\nvigor, and being of an inquiring mind, soon picked up important facts\r\nconcerning the business, the manufacture of the machines, and the profits\r\nof the manufacturers and dealers. He discovered that the largest profits\r\nwere not made by those who retailed the machines, and, therefore, he set\r\nto work to change his position in the business and so enlarge his profits.\r\n\r\nIn Fremont, Ohio, he formed the acquaintance of a young man in the grocery\r\nbusiness, who had thought at times of entering on the sewing machine\r\ntrade. A partnership was formed. Mr. Wilson contributed his whole\r\navailable means, sixty-five dollars, to which he added the experience he\r\nhad gained, whilst his partner contributed to the common stock three\r\nhundred dollars. With this slender cash capital, but abundant confidence\r\nin their success, the new firm came to Cleveland, which they selected as\r\nthe base of their operations on account of its superior shipping\r\nfacilities, and opened a wareroom in Lyman's Block, having previously made\r\narrangements with manufacturers in Massachusetts to make machines for\r\nthem. The new firm of Mather & Wilson were successful beyond their\r\nexpectations.\r\n\r\nAbout a year had been passed in this way when suits were brought against\r\nMather & Wilson, in common with a number of other parties throughout the\r\nWest, for an alleged infringement of a sewing machine patent. Under the\r\npressure of these suits, which were prosecuted with a large capital to\r\nback up the litigating parties, Mr. Wilson endeavored to secure the\r\nco-operation of the more powerful of the defendants, but without success,\r\neach party preferring to fight the battle singly. After a hard fight in\r\nthe courts, a compromise was effected, the suit against Mather & Wilson\r\nwithdrawn on each party paying his own costs, and they were allowed to\r\ncarry on the business unmolested.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Mr. Wilson sold out his interest in the firm. A few\r\nweeks subsequently he made an agreement with H. F. Wilson, whereby the\r\nlatter was to perfect and patent a low priced shuttle machine, and assign\r\nthe patent to the former. In two months the machine was in the patent\r\noffice, and in 1867 the manufacture was commenced in Cleveland. No money\r\nor labor was spared in perfecting the machine, which achieved an instant\r\nsuccess and became exceedingly profitable.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, the Wilson Sewing Machine Company was organized with a paid up\r\ncapital of one hundred thousand dollars, the principal portion of their\r\nstock being owned by Mr. Wilson, who is president of the company. The\r\nbusiness of the concern has grown until it now reaches five hundred\r\nmachines per week, and branch houses have been established in Boston and\r\nSt. Louis, with general agencies in the principal cities of the United\r\nStates. Through the rapid development of their business the company have\r\nrecently purchased a tract of land at the junction of Platt street and the\r\nPittsburgh railroad crossing, in Cleveland, for the purpose of erecting a\r\nlarge building for the manufacture of their sewing machines, that will\r\ngive employment to between two and three hundred men.\r\n\r\nThe Wilson Sewing Machine Company is one of the latest established\r\nmanufactories in Cleveland, but promises to take rank among the most\r\nimportant. It deserves especial mention among the record of Cleveland\r\nenterprises, as producing the first local sewing machine that has\r\nsucceeded, although many attempts have been made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlbert C. McNairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis department of the present work would be imperfect without a reference\r\nto the firm of McNairy, Claflen & Co., which ranks among the heaviest and\r\nmost important contracting firms in the country.\r\n\r\nAlbert C. McNairy, the head of the firm and a man of great enterprise and\r\nenergy of character, was born June 14, 1815, at Middletown, Connecticut,\r\nand was early engaged in work of a similar character to that now\r\nundertaken by the firm. In 1848, he constructed the famous Holyoke Dam,\r\nacross the Connecticut river at Holyoke, which is over a thousand feet\r\nbetween the abutments, and thirty feet in height. In 1851, he became a\r\nmember of the bridge building firm of Thatcher, Burt & Co., of Cleveland,\r\nwhose operations in the construction of bridges were very extensive. In\r\n1864, the firm name became McNairy, Claflen & Co., by the admission of\r\nHenry M. Claflen, who had been in the employ of the firm since 1854. In\r\n1866, Mr. Thatcher and Mr. Burt retired and Harvey T. Claflen, (who had\r\nbeen connected with the establishment since 1852,) and Simeon Sheldon\r\nwere admitted.\r\n\r\nFrom 1851 to a recent date, the Howe Truss Bridge was nearly the only\r\nbridge made by the concern. They now are largely engaged in the\r\nconstruction of iron bridges and all kinds of railway cars. The concern\r\nhas built three thousand two hundred and eighty-one bridges--about sixty\r\nmiles in the aggregate. The streams of nearly every State east of the\r\nRocky Mountains are spanned by their bridges, and it is a historical fact\r\nthat not one bridge of their construction has fallen.\r\n\r\nThree hundred and fifty men are employed by the firm, and the aggregate of\r\ntheir business reaches two millions of dollars yearly.\r\n\r\nThe firm is now constructing the New York and Oswego Midland\r\nRailroad, from Oneida to Oswego, a distance of sixty-five miles, and\r\nfurnishing the cars.\r\n\r\nThe general management of the affairs of the company is in the hands of\r\nMessrs. McNairy and Henry M. Claflen. The management of the works is\r\nassigned to Harvey T. Claflen, whilst the engineering department falls to\r\nthe particular superintendence of Mr. Sheldon. The Messrs. Claflen are\r\nnatives of Taunton, Massachusetts, and Mr. Sheldon of Lockport, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. H. Morley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. H. Morley is a native of Cayuga county, New York. He came to Cleveland\r\nin 1847, and commenced the hardware business on Superior street, under the\r\nfirm name of Morley & Reynolds. This firm continued, successfully, for\r\nabout twelve years, after which, for some time, Mr. Morley was engaged in\r\nno active business. In 1863, he commenced the manufacture of white lead,\r\non a limited scale. Three years subsequently, a partnership was formed\r\nwith T. S. Beckwith, when the capacity of the works was immediately\r\nenlarged. Every year since that time they have added to their facilities.\r\nTheir factory has a frontage on Canal and Champlain streets, of over three\r\nhundred feet. Their machinery is driven by a hundred horse-power engine,\r\nand four hundred corroding pots are run. About one thousand tons of lead\r\nare manufactured yearly, and find a ready market in Ohio, Michigan,\r\nWisconsin, Iowa and New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelegraphy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe telegraphic history of Cleveland is mainly written in the story of the\r\nconnection with this city of the two leading telegraphers whose\r\nbiographical sketches are given in this work. The master spirit of the\r\ngreat telegraphic combination of the United States, and the chief\r\nexecutive officer of that combination, have made Cleveland their home and\r\nheadquarters. Their story, as told in the immediately succeeding pages, is\r\ntherefore the telegraphic history of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJeptha H. Wade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForemost on the roll of those who have won a distinguished position in the\r\ntelegraphic history of the West, is the name of Jeptha H. Wade, until\r\nrecently president of the Western Union Telegraph Company, and who still,\r\nalthough compelled by failing health to resign the supreme executive\r\ncontrol, remains on the Board of direction, and is one of the leading\r\nspirits in the management.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade was born in Seneca county, New York, August 11, 1811, and was\r\nbrought up to mechanical pursuits, in which he achieved a fair amount of\r\nsuccess. Having a taste for art, and finding his health impaired by the\r\nlabors and close application consequent on his mechanical employment, he,\r\nin 1835, turned his attention to portrait painting, and by arduous study\r\nand conscientious devotion to the art, became very successful. Whilst\r\nengaged in this work, the use of the camera in producing portraits came\r\ninto notice. Mr. Wade purchased a camera, and carefully studied the\r\nprinted directions accompanying the instrument. These were vague, and\r\nserved but as hints for a more careful investigation and more thorough\r\ndevelopment of the powers of the camera. By repeated experiments and\r\nintelligent reasoning from effects back to causes, and from causes again\r\nto effects, he at length became master of the subject, and succeeded in\r\ntaking the first daguerreotype west of New York.\r\n\r\nWhen busy with his pencil and easel taking portraits, and varying his\r\noccupation by experimenting with the camera, news came to him of the\r\nexcitement created by the success of the telegraphic experiment of\r\nbuilding a line between Baltimore and Washington. This was in 1844. Mr.\r\nWade turned his attention to the new science, studied it with his\r\naccustomed patience and assiduity, mastered its details, so far as then\r\nunderstood, and immediately saw the advantage to the country, and the\r\npecuniary benefit to those immediately interested, likely to accrue from\r\nthe extension of the telegraph system which had just been created.\r\nWithout abandoning his devotion to art, he entered on the work of\r\nextending the telegraph system. The first line west of Buffalo was built\r\nby him, between Detroit and Jackson, Michigan, and the Jackson office was\r\nopened and operated by him, although he had received no practical\r\ninstruction in the manipulation of the instruments. In the year 1848, an\r\nincident occurred, which, though at the time he bitterly deplored it as a\r\ncalamity, was, in fact, a blessing in disguise, and compelled him\r\nperforce to embark on the tide which bore him on to fame and fortune. He\r\nwas an operator in the line of the Erie and Michigan Telegraph Company,\r\nat Milan, Ohio, when a conflagration destroyed all the materials and\r\nimplements forming his stock in trade as a portrait painter. After a\r\nbrief consideration of the subject, he decided not to replace the lost\r\nimplements of his art, but to cut loose altogether from the career of an\r\nartist, and hereafter to devote himself solely to the business he had\r\nentered upon with fair promise of success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Truly Yours, J. H. Wade]\r\n\r\nThe first years of telegraph construction were years of much vexation of\r\nspirit to those engaged in such enterprises. Difficulties of all kinds,\r\nfinancial, mechanical, and otherwise, had to be encountered and overcome.\r\nThere were those who objected to the wires crossing their land or coming\r\nin proximity to their premises, fearing damage from the electric current\r\nin storms. Those who had invested their capital wanted immediate large\r\nreturns. Some of those who had to be employed in the construction of the\r\nlines were ignorant of the principles of electrical science, and their\r\nignorance caused serious embarrassments and delays. Defective insulation\r\nwas a standing cause of trouble, and telegraphers were studying and\r\nexperimenting how to overcome the difficulties in this direction, but\r\nwithout satisfactory result. In the face of all these difficulties, Mr.\r\nWade proceeded with the work of extending and operating telegraph lines.\r\nIn addition to the interest he had secured in the Erie and Michigan line.\r\nhe constructed the \"Wade line\" between Cleveland via Cincinnati, to St.\r\nLouis, and worked it with success. The \"House consolidation\" placed Mr.\r\nWade's interest in the lines mentioned in the hands of the Mississippi\r\nValley Printing Telegraph Company, and before long this consolidation was\r\nfollowed by the union of all the House and Morse lines in the West, and\r\nthe organization of the Western Union Telegraph Company. In all these acts\r\nof consolidation the influence of Mr. Wade was active and powerful.\r\nRealizing the fact that competition between short detached lines rendered\r\nthem unproductive, and that in telegraphing, as in other things, union is\r\nstrength, he directed his energies to bringing about the consolidation,\r\nnot only of the lines connecting with each other, but of rival interests.\r\nThe soundness of his views has been proved by the unremunerativeness of\r\nthe lines before consolidation and their remarkable prosperity since.\r\n\r\nMr. Wade was one of the principal originators of the first Pacific\r\ntelegraph, and on the formation of the company he was made its first\r\npresident. The location of the line, and its construction through the\r\nimmense territory--then in great part a vast solitude--between Chicago and\r\nSan Francisco, were left mainly to his unaided judgment and energy, and\r\nhere again those qualities converted a hazardous experiment into a\r\nbrilliant success. Mr. Wade remained president of the Pacific Company\r\nuntil he secured its consolidation with the Western Union Telegraph\r\nCompany, to accomplish which, he went to California, in the latter part of\r\n1860, and succeeded in harmonizing the jarring telegraphic interests\r\nthere. On the completion of this consolidation, Mr. Wade was made\r\npresident of the Western Union Telegraph Company, his headquarters being\r\nin Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Board of Directors, in July, 1867, a letter was\r\nreceived from Mr. Wade, declining a re-election to the office of\r\npresident. The following resolutions were unanimously adopted by\r\nthe Board:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That in receiving the letter of J. H. Wade, Esq., declining\r\n  re-election to the presidency of this company, we cannot pass it to the\r\n  officiai files without recording our testimony to the distinguished\r\n  service he has rendered to the general system of American Telegraphs,\r\n  and especially to the company whose management he now resigns.\r\n\r\n  Connecting himself with it in its earliest introduction to public use,\r\n  and interesting himself in its construction, he was the first to see\r\n  that the ultimate triumph of the telegraph, both as a grand system of\r\n  public utility, and of secure investment, would be by some absorbing\r\n  process, which would prevent the embarrassments of separate\r\n  organizations.\r\n\r\n  To the foresight, perseverance and tact of Mr. Wade, we believe is\r\n  largely due the fact of the existence of one great company to-day with\r\n  its thousand arms, grasping the extremities of the continent, instead of\r\n  a series of weak, unreliable lines, unsuited to public wants, and, as\r\n  property, precarious and insecure.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That we tender to Mr. Wade our congratulations on the great\r\n  fruition of his work, signalized and cemented by this day's election of\r\n  a Board representing the now united leading telegraph interests of the\r\n  nation, accompanied with regrets that he is not with us to receive our\r\n  personal acknowledgements, and to join us in the election of a successor\r\n  to the position he has so usefully filled.\r\n\r\n  Office of the Western Union Telegraph Company, New York, July\r\n  10th, 1867.\r\n\r\n  William Orton, President.\r\n  O. H. Palmer, Secretary.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, Mr. Wade remains a director and leading spirit in the\r\nBoard, where his suggestions are listened to with respect and acted on\r\nwithout unnecessary delay. In addition to his connection with the\r\ntelegraph Company, Mr. Wade is heavily interested in several of the most\r\nimportant manufactories, in the railroads, and in the leading banks of\r\nCleveland. The wealth he has accumulated is mostly invested in such a\r\nmanner as to largely aid in building up the property of Cleveland, a city\r\nin which he feels a strong interest, not only from the fact that it has\r\nbeen for the past twenty years his place of residence, but that the wealth\r\nenabling him to enjoy the beautiful home he has secured there, was made in\r\nCleveland.\r\n\r\nIt has already been noted that Mr. Wade, when a painter, took the first\r\ndaguerreotype west of New York. Soon after his entering upon the business\r\nof telegraphy, he put into practice, for the first time, the plan of\r\nenclosing a submarine cable in iron armor. It was applied to the cable\r\nacross the Mississippi, at St. Louis, in 1850. Weights had been applied\r\nto the previous cables, at regular distances, on account of the sand,\r\nchange of bottom, drifts, and other difficulties that interfered with the\r\nsafety of the cable. Mr. Wade conceived the idea of combining weight and\r\nprotection in the cable itself. He constructed it with eighteen pieces of\r\nwire, placed lengthwise around the cable, and bound together with soft\r\niron wire at intervals. While the spiral cordage of hemp, such as was\r\nused at that time on the cable from Dover to Calais, would stretch, and\r\nallow the strain to come on the cable itself. This invention caused the\r\nstrain to come on the armor. It was a complete success, and lasted until\r\nthe line was abandoned. Mr. Wade also invented, in 1852, what is now\r\nknown as the Wade insulator, which has been used more extensively,\r\nperhaps, than any other.\r\n\r\nAmong the strong points in Mr. Wade's character, is his readiness and\r\nability to adapt himself to whatever he undertakes to do. The evidence of\r\nhis common sense, business foresight and indomitable perseverance, has\r\nbeen proved by the success attending the various pursuits in which\r\ncircumstances have placed him. Finding, in early manhood, his mechanical\r\nlabor undermining his health, he turned his attention to portrait and\r\nminiature painting, to which he applied himself so close that after a\r\ndozen years or more at the easel, he was compelled to abandon it and seek\r\nmore active and less sedentary pursuits. Having so long applied himself to\r\npainting--the business of all others the most calculated to disqualify a\r\nman for everything else--but few men would have had the courage to enter\r\nso different a field, but Mr. Wade seemed equal to the task, and with\r\nappropriate courage and renewed energy grappled with the difficulties and\r\nmystories of the telegraph business, then entirely new, having no books\r\nor rules to refer to, and without the experience of others to guide him,\r\nand having, as it were, to climb a ladder, every round of which had to be\r\ninvented as he progressed. But nothing daunted him. Through perseverance\r\nand system he succeeded, not only in supplying the United States in the\r\nmost rapid manner with better and cheaper telegraphic facilities than has\r\nbeen afforded any other country on the globe, but in making for himself\r\nthe ample fortune to which his ability and energy so justly entitle him.\r\nAnd when care and over-work in the telegraph business had made such an\r\nimpression upon his health as to induce him to retire from its management,\r\nand give more attention to his private affairs, he was again found equal\r\nto the emergency, and has proved himself equally successful as a financier\r\nand business man generally, as he had before shown himself in organizing\r\nand building up the telegraph speciality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnson Stager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most widely known names in connection with telegraphy in the\r\nWest--and not in the West alone, but probably throughout the United\r\nStates--is that of General Anson Stager. From the organization of the\r\nWestern Union Telegraph Company, General Stager has had the executive\r\nmanagement of its lines as general superintendent, and the position has\r\nnot only brought him into close relations with all connected in any way\r\nwith the telegraph, but has given him a larger circle of business\r\nacquaintances than it falls to the lot of most men to possess. The natural\r\neffect of his position and the extraordinary course of events during his\r\noccupation of that position, have brought him into communication, and\r\nfrequently into intimate confidential relations, with the leading men in\r\ncommerce, in science, in journalism, in military affairs, and in State and\r\nnational governments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Very Respectfully Yours, Anson Stager]\r\n\r\nAnson Stager was born in Ontario county, New York, April 20, 1825. At the\r\nage of sixteen he entered a printing office under the instruction of Henry\r\nO'Reilly, well known afterwards as a leader in telegraph construction and\r\nmanagement. For four or five years he continued his connection with the\r\n\"art preservative of all arts,\" and the knowledge of and sympathy with\r\njournalism which he acquired through his connection with it during this\r\nperiod of his life, enabled him during his subsequent telegraphic career\r\nto deal understandingly with the press in the peculiar relations it holds\r\nwith the telegraph, and has occasioned many acts of courtesy and good will\r\nwhich the managers of the press have not been backward in recognizing and\r\nacknowledging.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1846, General Stager changed his location from the\r\ncompositor's case to the telegraph operator's desk, commencing work as an\r\noperator in Philadelphia. With the extension of the lines westward, he\r\nremoved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and then crossed the Alleghenies to\r\nPittsburgh, where he was the pioneer operator. His ability and\r\nintelligence were speedily recognized by those having charge of the new\r\nenterprise, and in the Spring of 1848, he was made chief operator of the\r\n\"National lines\" at Cincinnati, a post he filled so well that, in 1852, he\r\nwas appointed superintendent of the Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph\r\nCompany. Immediately following his appointment to that position the\r\ncompany with which he was connected absorbed the lines of the New York\r\nState Printing Telegraph Company, and General Stager's control was thus\r\nextended over that State.\r\n\r\nWhilst holding the position of executive manager of the lines of this\r\ncompany, the negotiations for the consolidation of the competing and\r\naffiliated lines into one company were set on foot. General Stager warmly\r\nfavored such a consolidation on equitable terms and set to work vigorously\r\nto promote it. On its consummation, and the organization of the Western\r\nUnion Telegraph Company his services in that respect and his general\r\nfitness as a telegraph manager, were recognized by his appointment as\r\ngeneral superintendent of the consolidated company. The position was, even\r\nthen, one of great responsibility and difficulty, the vast net work of\r\nlines extending like a spider's web over the face of the country requiring\r\na clear head, and practical knowledge to keep it free from confusion and\r\nembarrassment, whilst the delicate and complicated relations in which the\r\ntelegraph stood with regard to the railroads and the press increased the\r\ndifficulties of the position. The rapid extension of the wires increased\r\nthe responsibilities and multiplied the difficulties yearly, but the right\r\nman was in the right position, and everything worked smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe extensive and elaborate System of railroad telegraphs which is in use\r\non all the railroads of the West and Northwest owes its existence to\r\nGeneral Stager. The telegraphs and railroads have interests in common, and\r\nyet diverse, and the problem to be solved was, how to secure to the\r\ntelegraph company the general revenue business of the railroad wires, and\r\nat the same time to enable the railroad companies to use the wires for\r\ntheir own especial purposes, such as the transmission of their own\r\nbusiness correspondence, the moving of trains, and the comparison and\r\nadjustment of accounts between stations. How to do this without confusion\r\nand injustice to one or the other interest was the difficult question to\r\nbe answered, and it was satisfactorily met by the scheme adopted by\r\nGeneral Stager. That scheme, by the admirable simplicity, complete\r\nadaptability and perfection of detail of its system of contracts and plan\r\nof operating railroad telegraph lines, enabled the diverse, and seemingly\r\njarring, interests to work together in harmony. Telegraph facilities are\r\nalways at the disposal of the railroads in emergency, and have repeatedly\r\ngiven vital aid, whilst the railroad interests have been equally prompt\r\nand active in assisting the telegraph when occasion arises.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the journalistic interests of the country and the\r\ntelegraph, through the various press associations for the gathering and\r\ntransmission of news by telegraph, have also given occasion for the\r\nexercise of judgment and executive ability. The various and frequently\r\nclashing interests of the general and special press associations and of\r\nindividual newspaper enterprise, and the necessity, for economical\r\npurposes, of combining in many instances the business of news gathering\r\nwith news transmission, make the relations between the press and telegraph\r\nof peculiar difficulty and delicacy, and probably occasioned not the\r\nsmallest portion of General Stager's business anxieties. It is safe to\r\nsay, that in all the embarrassing questions that have arisen, and in all\r\nthe controversies that have unavoidably occurred at intervals, no\r\ncomplaint has ever been made against General Stager's ability, fairness,\r\nor courtesy to the press.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Western Union Telegraph Company has been developing from its\r\none wire between Buffalo and Louisville into its present giant\r\nproportions, General Stager has had a busy life. His planning mind and\r\nwatchful eye were needed everywhere, and were everywhere present. The\r\namount of travel and discomfort this entailed during the building of the\r\nearlier lines may be imagined by those who know what a large extent of\r\ncountry is covered by these lines, and what the traveling facilities were\r\nin the West before the introduction of the modern improvements in railway\r\ntraveling, and before railroads themselves had reached a large portion of\r\nthe country to be traveled over.\r\n\r\nWith the breaking out of the rebellion, a new era in General Stager's life\r\ncommenced. With the firing of the first rebel gun on Fort Sumpter, and the\r\nresultant demand for troops to defend the nation's life, the Governors of\r\nOhio, Illinois and Indiana united in taking possession of the telegraph\r\nlines in those States for military purposes, and the superintendent of the\r\nWestern Union Telegraph Company was appointed to represent these in their\r\nofficial capacity. General Stager acted with promptness and vigor, and no\r\nsmall share of the credit accorded to those States for the promptness with\r\nwhich their troops were in the field and striking effective blows for the\r\nUnion, is due to General Stager for the ability with which he made the\r\ntelegraph coöperate with the authorities in directing the military\r\nmovements. When General McClellan took command of the Union forces in West\r\nVirginia and commenced the campaign that drove the rebels east of the\r\nmountains, General Stager accompanied him as chief of the telegraph staff,\r\nand established the first system of field telegraph used during the war.\r\nThe wire followed the army headquarters wherever that went, and the enemy\r\nwere confounded by the constant and instant communications kept up between\r\nthe Union army in the field and the Union government at home. When General\r\nMcClellan was summoned to Washington to take command of the Army of the\r\nPotomac, General Stager was called by him to organize the military\r\ntelegraph of that department. This he accomplished, and remained in charge\r\nof it until November, 1862, when he was commissioned captain and assistant\r\nquartermaster, and by order of the Secretary of war, appointed chief of\r\nthe United States Military Telegraphs throughout the United States--a\r\ncontrol that covered all the main lines in the country. He was\r\nsubsequently commissioned colonel and aid-de-damp, and assigned to duty in\r\nthe War Department, and was also placed in charge of the cypher\r\ncorrespondence of the Secretary of War. The cryptograph used throughout\r\nthe war was perfected by him, and baffled all attempts of the enemy to\r\ntranslate it. At the close of the war he left the active military service\r\nof the government, retiring with the brevet of Brigadier General,\r\nconferred for valuable and meritorious services.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the war the Southwestern and American Telegraph Companies\r\nwere consolidated with the Western Union Telegraph Company, and a\r\nre-organization of the latter company effected. The general\r\nsuperintendency of the Consolidated company was urged upon General Stager,\r\nbut as this would necessitate his removal to New York, he declined it,\r\npreferring to live in the west. For a time he meditated retiring\r\naltogether from the telegraph business and embarking in newspaper life,\r\nfor which his early training had given him a taste, and towards which he\r\nalways maintained an affection. Eventually the company persuaded him to\r\nremain in connection with them, and to suit his wishes, the field of the\r\ncompany's operations was divided into three divisions, the Central,\r\nEastern and Southern. General Stager assumed control of the Central, which\r\ncovered the field with which he had so long been identified, and which\r\nleft him with his headquarters in the home he had for years occupied, in\r\nCleveland. Early in 1869, the duties of his position rendered it necessary\r\nthat he should remove to Chicago, which he did with great reluctance, his\r\nrelations with Cleveland business, and its people, being close and\r\nuniformly cordial.\r\n\r\nGeneral Stager is a man with a host of friends and without, we believe,\r\none enemy. His position was such as to bring him into contact with every\r\nkind of interest, and frequently, of necessity, into conflict with one or\r\nother, but his position was always maintained with such courtesy, as well\r\nas firmness, that no ill feeling resulted from the controversy, however it\r\nterminated.\r\n\r\nSocially he is one of the most genial of companions; in character the\r\npersonification of uprightness and honor; firm in his friendships and\r\nincapable of malice toward any one. Well situated financially, happy in his\r\ndomestic circle, of wide popularity, and possessing the esteem of those\r\nwho know him best, General Stager is one of those whose lot is enviable,\r\nand who has made his position thus enviable by his own force of character\r\nand geniality of disposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCity Improvements\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCleveland covers a large extent of territory. The width of its streets and\r\nthe unusual amount of frontage possessed by most of the dwellings, made\r\nthe work of city improvements in the way of paving, sewerage and water\r\nsupply, at first very slow of execution. The light gravelly soil, on which\r\nthe greater portion of the city is built, enabled these works to be\r\npostponed, until the increased number and compactness of the population,\r\nand excess of wealth, would render the expense less burdensome.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts at paving were made on Superior street, below the\r\nSquare, and on River street. The paving was of heavy planks laid across\r\nthe street, and was at the time a source of pride to the citizens; but\r\nwhen, in coming years, the planks were warped and loosened, it became an\r\nintolerable nuisance. On River street the floods of the Cuyahoga sometimes\r\nrushed through the warehouses and covered the street, floating off the\r\nplanks and leaving them in hopeless disorder on the subsidence of the\r\nwaters. It was at last determined to pave these streets with stone.\r\nLimestone was at first chosen, but found not to answer, and Medina\r\nsandstone was finally adopted, with which all the stone paving of the\r\nstreets has been since done. Within two or three years the Nicholson wood\r\npavement has been introduced, and has been laid extensively on the streets\r\nabove the bluff. On the low land along the river valley the paving still\r\ncontinues to be of stone. At the present time there are between seventeen\r\nand eighteen miles of pavement finished or under construction, about half\r\nof which is Nicholson wood pavement, and the remainder Medina sandstone.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years the work of sewering the city has been systematized\r\nand pushed forward vigorously. At first, the sewers were made to suit the\r\nneeds of a particular locality, without any reference to a general system,\r\nand consequently were found utterly inadequate to the growing necessities\r\nof the city. Proper legislation was obtained from the General Assembly,\r\nmoney was obtained on the credit of the city, the territory was mapped out\r\ninto sewer districts, with sewer lines for each district, so arranged as\r\nto form a part of one harmonious whole, and the work commenced. All the\r\nmain sewers drain into the lake. There are now about twenty-seven miles of\r\nmain and branch sewers finished, and additional sewers are in progress of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe rapid growth of the city, and the gradual failure, or deterioration,\r\nof the wells, in the most thickly settled parts, rendered it necessary to\r\nfind some other source of a constant supply of pure water. It was\r\ndetermined to obtain the supply from Lake Erie, and for this purpose an\r\ninlet pipe was run out into the lake, west of the Old River Bed. The pipe\r\nis of boiler plate, three-eighths of an inch thick, fifty inches in\r\ndiameter, and three hundred feet long, extending from the shore to the\r\nsource of supply at twelve feet depth of water, and terminating in the\r\nlake at a circular tower, constructed of piles driven down as deep as they\r\ncan be forced into the bottom of the lake. There are two concentric rows\r\nof piles, two abreast, leaving eight feet space between the outer and\r\ninterior rows, which space is filled with broken stones to the top of the\r\npiles. The piles are then capped with strong timber plates, securely\r\nbolted together and fastened with iron to the piles. The outside diameter\r\nof the tower is thirty-four feet, the inside diameter is eight feet,\r\nforming a strong protection around an iron well-chamber, which is eight\r\nfeet in diameter and fifteen feet deep, which is riveted to the end of the\r\ninlet pipe. An iron grating fixed in a frame which slides in a groove, to\r\nbe removed and cleaned at pleasure, is attached to the well-chamber, and\r\nforms the strainer, placed four feet below the surface of the lake,\r\nthrough which the water passes into the well-chamber and out at the inlet\r\npipe. A brick aqueduct connects the shore end of the inlet pipe with the\r\nengine house, three thousand feet distant. From the engine house the water\r\nis conveyed to the reservoir, on Franklin, Kentucky and Duane streets,\r\nbuilt on a ridge thirty feet higher than any other ground in the city.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland Water Works were commenced on the 10th day of August, 1854,\r\nand were so far completed as to let water on the city on the 19th day of\r\nSeptember, 1856. The time required to build the Works was two years and\r\nthirty-nine days. The capacity of these Works to deliver water is greater\r\nthan the originally estimated wants of the population the works were\r\nintended to supply, which was for 100,000. They are, however, capable of\r\nsupplying at least 300,000 inhabitants with abundance of water. By an\r\nenlargement of the main pump barrel and plunger to each Cornish engine,\r\nwhich was contemplated in the plans, the supply may be increased to an\r\nalmost unlimited extent. No fear can be entertained that the present\r\nWater Works in the next fifty years will fail to yield a superabundant\r\nsupply of water.\r\n\r\nThe water was first introduced into the city temporarily at the earnest\r\nsolicitation of the Mayor, Common Council, and Trustees of Water Works, in\r\nwhich the citizens generally participated, on the occasion of the State\r\nFair, on the 24th of September, 1856. Apart from the Fair, this event was\r\nhailed with demonstrations of great joy as the celebration of the\r\nintroduction of the waters of Lake Erie into the city of Cleveland. At the\r\nintersection of the road ways, crossing at the centre of the Public\r\nSquare, a capacious fountain, of chaste and beautiful design was erected,\r\nfrom which was thrown a jet of pure crystal water high into the air,\r\nwhich, as the centre, greatest attraction, gratified thousands of admiring\r\nspectators. It became necessary after the Fair to shut off the water as\r\nwas anticipated, to remove a few pipes near the Ship Channel which had\r\nbroke in two by the unequal settling of the pipes in the quicksand bed\r\nthrough which they were laid. These repairs were promptly made, and the\r\nwater let on the city again; since which time the supply has been regular\r\nand uninterrupted. The length of pipes laid up to the first of January,\r\n1869, aggregated thirty-nine and one-half miles. The total cost of the\r\nWorks to that period was $722,273.33. The earnings, over running expenses,\r\nfor 1868, were $36,340.23, being a little over five per cent, on the\r\ncapital invested. The preliminary work is now doing for the construction\r\nof a tunnel under the bed of the lake, in order to obtain a water supply\r\nat such a distance from the shore as to be beyond the reach of the winter\r\nice-field and the impurities collected beneath the ice-crust.\r\n\r\nThree commodious and tasteful markets have been erected within a few\r\nyears, one on the west side of the river, one in the fifth ward, and the\r\nCentral Market, at the junction of Woodland avenue and Broadway.\r\n\r\nFour horse railroads are in active operation within the city: the East\r\nCleveland, organized in 1859, and running from the junction of Superior\r\nand Water streets, by the way of Euclid avenue and Prospect street, to the\r\neastern limit of the city on Euclid avenue, thence continuing to East\r\nCleveland. This line has also a branch running off the main line at\r\nBrownell street, and traversing the whole length of Garden street, to the\r\neastern limit of the city. The Kinsman street line, organized in 1859,\r\nruns from the junction of Superior and Water streets, through Ontario\r\nstreet and Woodland avenue to Woodland Cemetery. The West Side railroad\r\nruns from the junction of Superior and Water streets, by way of South\r\nWater, Detroit and Kentucky street, to Bridge street, with a branch along\r\nPearl street. The St. Clair street railroad, the latest built, runs along\r\nSt. Clair from Water street to the eastern line of the city. Besides\r\nthese, a local railroad, operated by steam, connects the Kinsman street\r\nline with Newburg, and another of a similar character connects the West\r\nSide railroad with Rocky River. Charters have been obtained for a railroad\r\nto connect the Pearl street branch of the West Side railroad with\r\nUniversity Heights, and for a line to run parallel with the bluff\r\noverlooking the north bank of the Cuyahoga from River street, to the\r\nboundary between the city and Newburg township.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours very truly, H. S. Stevens]\r\n\r\n\r\nHenry S. Stevens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Henry S. Stevens, more than to any other man, are the citizens of\r\nCleveland indebted for their facilities in traveling, cheaply and\r\ncomfortably, from point to point in the city, and for the remarkable\r\nimmunity the Forest City has enjoyed from hack driving extortions and\r\nbrutality, which have so greatly annoyed citizens and strangers in many\r\nother cities. To his foresight, enterprise and steady perseverance is\r\nCleveland indebted for its excellent omnibus and public carriage system,\r\nand for the introduction of street railroads. Both these improvements were\r\nnot established without a sharp struggle, in the former case against the\r\ndetermined opposition of the hack drivers who preferred acting for\r\nthemselves and treating the passenger as lawful prey, and in the case of\r\nstreet railroads, having to overcome interested opposition, popular\r\nindifference or prejudice, and official reluctance to permit innovations.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens was born in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, January, 1821.\r\nAfter spending seven years at school in Salem and Boston, his father's\r\nfamily moved to New Hampshire. He attended school there for two years.\r\nBefore he was twenty years of age he developed a desire to visit new\r\nscenes and a propensity for observing strange characters and manners,\r\nwhich seems to have strengthened with his years. Our railroad system and\r\nocean steam navigation were then in their infancy, and the first journey\r\nhe made was almost equivalent to a journey around the globe at the present\r\nday. He took passage in a packet ship from Boston for the West Indies,\r\nvisiting Porto Rico, Matanzas and Havana, thence to New Orleans, the\r\ninterior of Texas and Arkansas, and remained a winter at Alexandria, in\r\nwestern Louisiana. About a year after his return to New Hampshire the\r\nfamily removed to Maryland, where he resided nine years, and finally came\r\nto Cleveland in 1849, when this city had less than a fifth of its present\r\npopulation. He was one of the early proprietors of the Weddell House, and\r\nupon his retirement from the business, he established the omnibus local\r\ntransit for passengers and baggage at a uniform rate of charge, which\r\nsystem has been generally adopted in the principal cities in the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1856, in company with two other gentlemen from New York, he explored\r\nthe southern part of Mexico from the Gulf to the Pacific ocean, with\r\nreference to its availability for a railroad and preliminary stage road.\r\nThe result was, that two years later he completed an arrangement with the\r\nLouisiana Tehuantepec Company to carry out the provisions of their\r\ncharter. He chartered a vessel at New York and shipped mechanics and other\r\nemployees, coaches and materials, and in two months thereafter the line\r\ncommenced moving a distance of one hundred and twelve miles through the\r\nforests and over the rolling plains of Southern Mexico.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a year this continued successfully, and it was owing either to\r\nhis good fortune or good management, that no accident to passengers or\r\nproperty was incurred, and of the large number of his employees from the\r\nStates, every one returned in good health. The rebellion was then in its\r\nincipiency, and the Southern owners of the route decided to suspend\r\noperations until their little difficulty was adjusted with the North.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens, however, is better known as having started the street\r\nrailroad system here, which has proved so great a convenience to our\r\ncitizens, and which has enhanced the price of real estate in this city\r\nmore than any other one cause. He built the Prospect street, Kinsman\r\nstreet and West Side railroads; the first two without aid from\r\ncapitalists, and in the face of many discouragements. In the Fall of 1865,\r\nhe went to Rio Janeiro for the purpose of establishing street railroads in\r\nthat city. These roads are now in successful operation there. In this\r\njourney Mr. Stevens visited many other places in Brazil, including\r\nPernambuco, Bahia, St. Salvador and Para, on the river Amazon. Returning\r\nby the way of Europe, he stopped at the Cape de Verde Islands, on the\r\ncoast of Africa, thence to Lisbon and across Portugal to Madrid. During\r\nhis sojourn in Spain he visited Granada, the Alhambra, and many cities in\r\nthe south of Spain. His route home was through Paris, London and\r\nLiverpool. Two years later he made an extended tour over Europe, including\r\nRussia, Hungary, and other places of the Danube.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens has served four years in the city council, and for two years\r\nwas president of that body. During his official term he was noted for\r\nregularity and punctuality of attendance, close attention to business,\r\nand watchful care of the public interests. As presiding officer he had\r\nfew equals. Dignified, yet courteous, in manner, and thoroughly\r\nimpartial, he possessed the respect of all parties in the council, and\r\nwas always able to so conduct the deliberations as to prevent unseemly\r\noutbreaks or undignified discussions. Methodical in the disposition of\r\nbusiness, he was able to get through a large amount in a short time,\r\nwithout the appearance of haste.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens is one of that class of travelers of whom there are,\r\nunhappily, but few, who not only travel far, but see much, and are able to\r\nrelate what they saw with such graphic power as to give those who remain\r\nat home a pleasure only secondary to visiting the scenes in person. His\r\nseveral wanderings in Mexico and Central America, in South America,\r\nWestern Europe, and Russia, have all been narrated briefly, or more at\r\nlength, in letters to the Cleveland Herald, which for felicity of\r\nexpression and graphic description, have had no superiors in the\r\nliterature of travel. This is high praise, but those who have read the\r\nseveral series of letters with the well known signature \"H. S. S.\" will\r\nunqualifiedly support the assertion. In his journeyings he generally\r\navoided the beaten track of tourists and sought unhackneyed scenes. These\r\nwere observed with intelligent eyes, the impressions deepened and\r\ncorrected by close investigation into the historical and contemporary\r\nfacts connected with the localities, and the result given in language\r\ngraphic, direct, and at the same time easy and graceful. A collection of\r\nthese letters would make one of the most delightful volumes of travel\r\nsketches in the language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore R. Scowden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore R. Scowden, son of Theodore Scowden, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,\r\nwas born June 8, 1815, and was educated at Augusta College, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nOn leaving college, in 1832, he was apprenticed to the steam engine\r\nbusiness at Cincinnati, and continued at this about four years, when he\r\nengaged as engineer on a steamer plying between Cincinnati and New\r\nOrleans. From the time of commencing engine building, he employed all his\r\nspare moments in studying mechanics, hydraulics and civil engineering. He\r\nremained in the position of engineer on the river for about eight years,\r\nwhen, in 1844, he turned his attention to the work of designing and\r\nplanning engines, and so put into practice the knowledge acquired by\r\napplication for the previous twelve years, and, in fact, for which he\r\nmore particularly fitted himself while at college. He was then appointed\r\nby the city council of Cincinnati, engineer of water works, the primitive\r\nworks then existing being inadequate to the increased wants of the city.\r\nThe water was conveyed in log pipes, and the work before Mr. Scowden was\r\nto replace these logs by iron pipes, and to design and erect new works. In\r\nabout a year from his appointment his plans were perfected and he was\r\nready to commence operation. A great difficulty under which he labored,\r\nwas, the necessity of keeping up the supply of water all the time, and\r\nbeing at the same time compelled to place the new reservoir and engine\r\nhouse in the exact spot of the old. This made the construction extend\r\nthrough nearly eight years, during which time from forty to fifty miles of\r\niron pipe were laid, and a reservoir of great capacity constructed. This\r\nwas his first great public work completed, and was a perfect success.\r\n\r\nThe first low pressure engine ever successfully used in the Ohio and\r\nMississippi valleys, was designed by Mr. Scowden and introduced into these\r\nworks. It was found that the sedimentary matter of the Ohio river cut the\r\nvalves in the condensing apparatus, and so destroying the vacuum, rendered\r\nthe working of the engine ineffective. This Mr. Scowden overcame by\r\nintroducing vulcanized india rubber valves, seated on a grating. Since\r\nthat time he has designed several low pressure engines for the Mississippi\r\nriver, which are still working successfully.\r\n\r\nIn 1851, Mr. Scowden was commissioned by the city of Cincinnati, to make\r\nthe tour of England and France for the purpose of examining the principles\r\nand workings of public docks, drainage, paving and water works. After\r\nreturning and making his report he resigned his post and came to\r\nCleveland, for the purpose of constructing the water works now in\r\noperation in this city. The plan and designs were completed during 1852,\r\nand active operations commenced in 1853. The site of these works is said\r\nto have presented more engineering difficulties than any other in the\r\ncountry. At the time the tests were made for the foundation of the engine\r\nhouse, the water was nearly knee deep, and four men forced a rod thirty\r\nfeet long and three-quarters of an inch in diameter twenty-eight feet into\r\nthe ground. By the aid of five steam engines and pumps he succeeded in\r\nexcavating to the depth of fourteen feet, and not being able to proceed\r\nfurther, he commenced the foundation. It is well to note the fact here,\r\nthat the soil was in such a semi-fluid state that it could not be handled\r\nwith a shovel, and altogether the chances of success for securing a\r\npermanent foundation looked, to the public, at least, very dubious. The\r\ncitizens grew uneasy; they thought it was a waste of public money, but Mr.\r\nSnowden never despaired, though he with his own hand thrust a pole down\r\ntwelve feet from the bottom of the excavation.\r\n\r\nHe laid down over the whole area two courses of timber laid cross-wise,\r\nleaving a space of twelve inches between each timber. The first timber was\r\ndrawn by a rope, and floated to its place. In order to get a bed he\r\nscooped a space of two feet in length at one end, which was filled with\r\ngravel. This process was continued through the whole length of the timber.\r\nThe second timber was floated to its place, leaving a foot between them,\r\nand the same operation was performed throughout the whole foundation.\r\n\r\nAll the spaces between the timbers were filled with broken stone and\r\nhydraulic cement; then the cross timbers were laid, filling the spans with\r\nthe concrete also. It is to be observed that not a single pile was driven\r\nin all the foundation.\r\n\r\nThe masonry was commenced upon the timbers, and carried up about nineteen\r\nfeet, and, notwithstanding the misgivings of scientific and experienced\r\ncontractors and builders, and others, the superstructure was completed in\r\n1855, and from that day to this not a crack in an angle of the building\r\nhas been seen, although it may with truth be said that the engine house\r\nfloats on a bed of quicksand. There were three thousand feet of aqueduct\r\nfrom the engine house to the lake, which presented similar difficulties,\r\nas did also the laying of pipes under the Cuyahoga river.\r\n\r\nThe engines in use in the Cleveland works are the first Cornish engines\r\nintroduced west of the Allegheny mountains. After completing the works and\r\nputting them in successful operation, Mr. Scowden resigned his position\r\nhere, in 1856.\r\n\r\nIn 1857, Mr. Scowden commenced the construction of the water works of\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, and finished them in 1860, and for character,\r\ncapacity and finish they are acknowledged to be second to none in the\r\nUnited States, if in the world. The second pair of Cornish engines used\r\nwest of the mountains were introduced there.\r\n\r\nThe next public work of Mr. Scowden was the extension and enlargement of\r\nthe canal around the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville, which comprises a\r\nnew work, as very little of the old was used. The engineering of the work\r\nwas done under the direction of a board of directors, the president of\r\nwhich was James Guthrie, former Secretary of the Treasury under Pierce,\r\nand late United States Senator.\r\n\r\nThe locks in these works are the largest in the known world for width,\r\nlength, and lift, not excepting the Suez Canal. There are two locks of\r\nthirteen feet lift, and containing fifty-two thousand yards of masonry.\r\nThe canal is crossed by iron swing bridges. The work has been inspected by\r\nthe United States topographical engineers, and General Wietzel, now in\r\ncharge of the work, has pronounced it unsurpassed by anything within the\r\nrange of his knowledge, and, what is more remarkable, a like tribute to\r\nthe skill of our fellow citizen has been accorded by French, English and\r\nGerman engineers, and also by the president of the board.\r\n\r\nThis was his last and greatest triumph of engineering skill; and being a\r\nnational work, and he a civilian, he may well feel proud of his\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the last mentioned work, Mr. Scowden returned to\r\nCleveland and engaged in the iron trade, constructing a rolling mill at\r\nNewburg, for the American sheet and boiler plate company, with which he is\r\nstill connected.\r\n\r\nAs an engineer, Mr. Scowden stands high. He never was baffled, though\r\nestablished principles failed, for he had resources of his own from which\r\nto draw. Without an exception, every great public work undertaken by him\r\nhas been not only completed, but has proved entirely successful.\r\n\r\nAs a man he enjoys the respect and confidence of his fellow citizens. His\r\nmanner is affable and unassuming, and his disposition kindly. Constant\r\napplication for twenty-five years has had its effect upon him, but with\r\ncare, he may yet be spared many years to enjoy the fruits of his labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn H. Sargent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn H. Sargent has been, and is, so intimately connected with the\r\nconstruction and management of some of the most important public\r\nimprovements of the city, and notably so with the sewerage system and\r\nwater works management, that it is eminently proper he should be noticed\r\nhere as a representative man in the department of City Improvements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours with Respect, J. H. Sargent]\r\n\r\nMr. Sargent was born March 7, 1814, at Carthage, near Rochester, New\r\nYork. His parents were but recent emigrants from New Hampshire, and when\r\nhe was but three years old they removed again toward the land of the\r\nsetting sun, taking up their residence in what is now the city of Monroe,\r\nMichigan, but which was then known as River Raisin. In that place they\r\nremained but a year, at the end of which time they removed to Cleveland.\r\nLevi Sargent, the father of the subject of this sketch, was by trade a\r\nblacksmith, and was at one time a partner in that business with Abraham\r\nHickox, then, and long after, familiarly known to every one in the\r\nneighborhood as \"Uncle Abram.\" He soon removed to the west side of the\r\nriver, and thence to Brooklyn, where he built him one of the first houses\r\nerected on that side, on top of the hill. Hard knocks upon the anvil could\r\nbarely enable him to support his family, so the boy, at the age of nine,\r\nwas sent to the Granite State, where for ten years he enjoyed, during the\r\nWinter months, the advantages of a New England district school, and worked\r\nand delved among the rocks upon a farm the remainder of the year. At the\r\nage of nineteen, with a freedom suit of satinet, and barely money enough\r\nto bring him home, he returned to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nHere, after supporting himself, he devoted all his leisure time to the\r\nstudy of mathematics, for which he had a predilection. Subsequently he\r\nspent some time at the Norwich University, Vermont, at an engineering and\r\nsemi-military school, under the management of Captain Patridge.\r\n\r\nWhen the subject of railroads began to agitate the public mind, and the\r\nproject of a railroad along the south shore of Lake Erie was resolved\r\nupon, Mr. Sargent was appointed resident engineer upon the Ohio Railroad,\r\nwhich position he held until the final collapse of that somewhat\r\nprecarious enterprise, in 1843. Sandusky City had already taken the lead\r\nin Ohio in the matter of railroads, having a locomotive road in operation\r\nto Tiffin, and horse road to Monroeville. Upon the reconstruction and\r\nextension of this last road Mr. Sargent was appointed resident engineer,\r\nand while there, seeing the advantages that Sandusky was likely to gain\r\nover Cleveland by her railways, at the solicitation of J. W. Gray, he sent\r\na communication to the Plain Dealer, illustrating the same with a map,\r\nurging the construction of a railroad from Cleveland to Columbus and\r\nCincinnati. He also advocated the project in the Railroad Journal, but\r\nthat paper discouraged the matter, as it was likely to be too much of a\r\ncompeting line with the Sandusky road already begun. But the agitation\r\ncontinued until the preliminary surveys were made, the greater part of\r\nthem under Mr. Sargent's immediate charge. When the project hung fire for\r\na time, Mr. Sargent, in company with Philo Scovill, spent two seasons\r\namong the copper mines of Lake Superior. When the Cleveland, Columbus and\r\nCincinnati railroad was begun in good earnest, he was called upon once\r\nmore and located the line upon which it was built. Mr. Sargent remained\r\nupon the road until opened to Wellington, when he went upon the Michigan\r\nSouthern and Northern Indiana railroad, where, for nearly five years, he\r\nwas engaged in extending and reconstructing that road, and in locating and\r\nbuilding its branches.\r\n\r\nSince 1855, most of his time has been spent in Cleveland, in engineering\r\nand works of public utility. While city civil engineer he strongly\r\nadvocated, though for the time unsuccessfully, the introduction of the\r\nNicholson pavement, and introduced and established the present system of\r\nsewerage, a work, the importance of which to the health and comfort of the\r\ncitizens, can not be overestimated.\r\n\r\nMr. Sargent has been chosen one of the commissioners for enlarging and\r\nextending the water works so as to meet the altered circumstances and\r\nenlarged demands of the city.\r\n\r\nIn politics Mr. Sargent is, and has always been, a Democrat, but never\r\nallows party prejudices to sway him, and is in no sense a professed\r\npolitician. The honesty of his convictions and his uprightness of conduct\r\nhave won for him the respect and friendship of men of all parties, who\r\nhave confidence in his never permitting party considerations to interfere\r\nwith his honest endeavor to serve the public interests to the best of his\r\nability, whenever placed in a position to do so. During the rebellion he\r\nwas zealous and untiring in his support of the government, and aiding, by\r\nall the means in his power, to crush out the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to the rebellion, Cleveland had the honor of possessing military\r\ncompanies famous for their drill and efficiency, and which were the pride\r\nof the citizens and a credit to the State. At the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion, the Cleveland companies were foremost in tendering their\r\nservices, were among the first Ohio troops that rushed to the scene of\r\ndanger, and were in the first skirmish of the war between the volunteer\r\ntroops of the North and the organized troops of the rebels--that at\r\nVienna. The first artillery company organized in the West was formed in\r\nCleveland, and kept its organization up for many years before the war. The\r\nbreaking out of the war found this artillery organization ready for\r\nservice, and scarcely waiting for authority, it was speedily on its way to\r\nthe point where its services seemed most needed. To its promptness and\r\nefficiency is largely due the swift expulsion of the rebels from West\r\nVirginia and the saving of that State to the Union cause. As the war\r\nprogressed, companies first, and then whole regiments, were rapidly\r\norganized, and sent forward from Cleveland, until at length every portion\r\nof the field of war had Cleveland representatives in it. Those who\r\nremained at home eagerly aided those in the field. Money was raised in\r\nlarge sums whenever wanted, to forward the work of enlistment, to provide\r\ncomforts for the soldiers in the field, and to care for the sick and\r\nwounded. Busy hands and sympathetic hearts worked together in unison,\r\nenlarging their field of operation until the Cleveland Soldiers' Aid\r\nSociety became the Northern Ohio Soldiers' Aid Society, and that again\r\ndeveloped into the Western Branch of the Sanitary Commission.\r\n\r\nIn the imposing ceremonies of the inauguration of the Perry statue on the\r\nPublic Square in Cleveland on the tenth of September, 1860, a few months\r\nbefore the breaking out of actual hostilities between the North and\r\nSouth, the whole military force of the city participated. The\r\norganizations represented were the First Regiment Cleveland Light\r\nArtillery, under command of Colonel James Barnett and Lieutenant Colonel\r\nS. B. Sturges, composed of the following companies: Co. A, Capt. Simmons;\r\nCo. B, Capt. Mack; Co. D, Capt. Rice; Co. E, Capt. Heckman. [Co. C, Capt.\r\nKenny, belonged to Geneva. It took part in the ceremonies, under the\r\ngeneral command of Colonel Barnett, but at that time retained its old\r\norganization as Independent Battery A.] Brooklyn Light Artillery, Capt.\r\nPelton; Cleveland Light Dragoons, Capt. Haltnorth; Cleveland Grays, Capt.\r\nPaddock; Cleveland Light Guards, Capt. Sanford; Hibernian Guards, Capt.\r\nKenny. Of these the Cleveland Grays had achieved the greatest reputation\r\nin past years for its drill and efficiency. It had been the pet of the\r\ncitizens, and in its ranks, at one time or another, had been found the\r\nvery best class of the people of Cleveland, who continued to take pride in\r\nthe organization, and contribute to its maintenance, long after they\r\nceased to be actually connected with it.\r\n\r\nWhen President Lincoln's call for troops was received, the Cleveland Grays\r\nand Hibernian Guards promptly tendered their services, and the first named\r\ncompany started for the field without a single hour's unnecessary delay.\r\nIt was formed with the First Ohio Volunteer Infantry, and was in the\r\nskirmish at Vienna. On the re-organization of the Ohio troops into three\r\nyears' regiments, a large proportion of the Cleveland Grays found\r\npositions as officers in new regiments, where their knowledge of drill and\r\ndiscipline was of great value in bringing the masses of raw volunteers\r\ninto speedy use as efficient soldiers. The Hibernian Guards followed the\r\nCleveland Grays and did good service throughout the war. Many of the\r\noriginal members of this company also became gradually scattered\r\nthroughout other regiments as company or staff officers. The Cleveland\r\nLight Guards formed the nucleus of the Seventh Ohio, whose history is\r\nidentical with that of its two principal officers, which will be found in\r\nsubsequent pages. The story of the Cleveland Light Artillery is mainly\r\ntold in that of General Barnett, its commander and leading spirit.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to furnish an exact account of the number of\r\nmen furnished by Cleveland to the army of the Union, or even to designate\r\nthe particular organizations belonging to that city. Clevelanders were to\r\nbe found scattered through a number of regiments not raised in this\r\nvicinity, and among the regiments organized in Cleveland camps many were\r\nalmost entirely composed of men from beyond the city, or even county\r\nlines. To the 1st Ohio Infantry Cleveland contributed the Cleveland Grays.\r\nThe 7th Ohio was organized at Camp Cleveland, and contained three\r\ncompanies raised exclusively in Cleveland. The 8th Ohio, organized in\r\nCleveland, contained one Cleveland company--the Hibernian Guards. The 23d\r\nand 27th Ohio, organized at Camp Chase, contained Cleveland companies. The\r\n37th Ohio, (German) was organized in Cleveland, and a large part of its\r\nmembers enlisted at this point. The 41st Ohio was a Cleveland regiment,\r\nrecruited mainly in the city. The 54th Ohio, organized at Camp Dennison,\r\ncontained one Cleveland company. The 58th Ohio, (German,) also contained a\r\nCleveland contingent. Clevelanders also were in the 61st, organized at\r\nCamp Chase. The 67th Ohio had a considerable proportion of Clevelanders.\r\nThe 103rd Ohio was organized in Cleveland, and was, to a large extent, a\r\nCleveland regiment, in both officers and men. The 107th Ohio, (German,)\r\nwas organized and largely recruited in Cleveland. The 124th Ohio was\r\norganized in Cleveland, most of its companies recruited there and the\r\nregiment officered mainly by Cleveland men. The 125th Ohio was organized\r\nin Cleveland, with some Cleveland recruits. The 128th Ohio, (Prisoner's\r\nGuards,) was recruited and organized in Cleveland. It did duty on\r\nJohnson's Island. The 129th Ohio was organized in Cleveland, having been\r\npartially recruited and officered in the same place. It was organized for\r\nsix months' service. The 150th Ohio, National Guard, for one hundred days'\r\nservice, was organized in Cleveland, and contained eight companies from\r\nthe city, (the 29th Ohio Volunteer Militia,) with one from Oberlin, and\r\nanother from Independence. It garrisoned some of the forts around\r\nWashington and took part in the repulse of the rebel attack in June, 1864.\r\nThe 177th Ohio, one year regiment, was organized and partly recruited in\r\nCleveland. The 191st, organized at Columbus, was commanded and partly\r\nrecruited with Clevelanders. The 2nd, 10th and 12th Ohio Cavalry regiments\r\nwere organized and partially recruited in Cleveland. The 1st regiment of\r\nOhio Light Artillery was made out of the 1st regiment Cleveland Light\r\nArtillery. Besides these Cleveland furnished to the service, in whole or\r\npart, the 9th, 14th, 15th, 19th and 20th Independent Batteries. Other\r\nregiments were organized at the Cleveland camps, but probably contained no\r\nmembers that could be credited to Cleveland, and mention of them is\r\ntherefore omitted here. In addition a large number of recruits were\r\nobtained for the regular army, and for the navy, besides contributions to\r\nthe colored regiments raised during the war. A number of Clevelanders, for\r\none reason or another, also took service in regiments of other States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Charles Whittlesey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Colonel Whittlesey was trained to the profession of arms, and\r\nhas a military record of which he may well be proud, it is not in the\r\nfield of battle that he has won the honors he prizes most, but in the\r\nbroader fleld of science. It is among the heroes who have achieved\r\ndistinction in grappling with the mysteries of nature and who have\r\ndeveloped means for making life more useful and comfortable, that Colonel\r\nWhittlesey would have preferred taking position, rather than among those\r\nwhose distinction comes rather of destruction than construction or\r\nproduction. But the exigencies of this work prevent the formation of a\r\ndistinct scientific department, and the military services of Colonel\r\nWhittlesey have been such that he could not, without injustice, be\r\nomitted from this department of our work.\r\n\r\nCharles Whittlesey was born in Southington, Connecticut, about midnight\r\nof October 4-5, 1808, being the first born of Asaph and Vesta Whittlesey.\r\nWhen four years old he was sent to the old red school house \"to be out\r\nof harm's way,\" whilst his father was in the Ohio wilderness, exploring\r\nfor a home.\r\n\r\nThe location was found, and in 1813 the family removed to Talmadge, Summit\r\ncounty, Ohio. There the young boy trudged from home to the log school\r\nhouse, south of Talmadge Centre, until 1819, when the frame academy was\r\nfinished and the eleven year old lad attended school in the new building\r\nduring the Winter, and in Summer worked on the farm. This mode of life\r\ncontinued until 1824.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, he was appointed a cadet at West Point.\r\n\r\nDuring his second year at West Point, a fiery Southerner made a Personal\r\nassault upon a superior officer, the military punishment for which is\r\ndeath. He was condemned by a court-martial to be shot. While the sentence\r\nwas being forwarded to Washington for approval the culprit was confined in\r\nthe cadet prison, without irons. Cadet Whittlesey was one evening on post\r\nat the door of the prison, and as he passed on his beat, his back being\r\nfor a moment towards the door, the prisoner, who was a powerful man,\r\nsprang out and seized the sentinel's musket from behind. At the same\r\ninstant the muzzle of a pistol was presented to the ear of the young cadet\r\nwith an admonition to keep quiet. This, however, did not prevent him from\r\ncalling lustily for the \"corporal of the guard.\" Cadet O. M. Mitchel, of\r\nsubsequent fame, happened to be in charge of the guard as corporal and\r\nthen coming up stairs with the relief. With his usual activity he sprang\r\nforward and the scion of chivalry ran. The guns of the sentinels at West\r\nPoint are not loaded. The escaping prisoner could not, therefore, be shot,\r\nbut in the pursuit by Cadet Whittlesey he had nearly planted a bayonet in\r\nhis back when the guard seized him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, Chas Mattingly]\r\n\r\nAfter passing through the regular course of instruction at West Point, he\r\ngraduated, and, in 1831, was made Brevet Second Lieutenant of the Fifth\r\nUnited States Infantry, and served in the Black Hawk campaign of 1832. He\r\nafterwards resigned, and for the next quarter of a century his record is\r\nwholly a scientific one. Recognizing the right of the government to his\r\nmilitary services in national emergencies he offered to resume his old\r\nrank in the Florida war of 1838, and in the Mexican war of 1846, but his\r\noffers were not accepted.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, he was appointed on the geological survey of Ohio, and was\r\nengaged on that work two years, the survey eventually terminating through\r\nthe neglect of the Legislature to make the necessary appropriations.\r\nIncomplete as the work was, the survey was of immense importance to Ohio,\r\nas the investigations of Colonel Whitlesey and his associates revealed a\r\nwealth of mineral treasures hitherto unsuspected, and enabled capital and\r\nenterprise to be directed with intelligence to their development. The\r\nvalue of the rich coal and iron deposits of North-eastern Ohio was\r\ndisclosed by this survey, and thus the foundation was laid for the\r\nextensive manufacturing industry that has added enormously to the\r\npopulation, wealth and importance of this portion of the State. It was\r\nwith the important results of his labors in Ohio in mind, that the State\r\nGovernment of Wisconsin secured his services for the geological survey of\r\nthat State, which was carried on through the years 1858, 1859 and 1860,\r\nterminating with the breaking out of the war. From this survey also very\r\nimportant results have already followed, and still more will be arrived at\r\nin the course of a few years.\r\n\r\nFrom 1847 to 1851, both inclusive, Colonel Whittlesey was employed by the\r\nUnited States government in the survey of Lake Superior and the upper\r\nMississippi in reference to mines and minerals. In addition to this he has\r\nspent much time in surveying particular portions of the mineral districts\r\nof the Lake Superior basin, and has, in all, spent fifteen seasons on the\r\nwaters of Lake Superior and upper Mississippi, making himself thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the topography and geological character of that portion of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nColonel Whittlesey was at home in Cleveland quietly pursuing his\r\nscientific studies and investigations, when the national trouble\r\ncommenced. When the entrance of President Lincoln into Washington was\r\nthreatened by violence in February, 1861, he was an enrolled member of one\r\nof the companies tendering their services to General Scott. Seeing that\r\nwar was inevitable, he personally urged the Governor and Legislature of\r\nOhio to prepare for it before the proclamation of April 15, 1861, and on\r\nthe 17th he joined the Governor's staff as assistant quartermaster\r\ngeneral. He served in the field in Western Virginia, with the three months\r\nlevies, as State military engineer with the Ohio troops under Generals\r\nMcClellan, Cox and Hill, and at Scary Run, on the Kanawha, July 17, 1861,\r\nbehaved with great gallantry under fire, and conducted himself with\r\nintrepidity and coolness during an engagement that lasted two hours, and\r\nin which his horse was wounded under him. At the expiration of the service\r\nof the three months troops he was appointed Colonel of the 20th regiment\r\nOhio volunteers, and detailed by General O. M. Mitchel as chief engineer\r\nof the department of the Ohio, where he planned and constructed the\r\ndefences of Cincinnati, which he afterwards volunteered to defend, in\r\nSeptember, 1862. At the battle of Fort Donelson he was with his regiment,\r\nand was complimented by General Grant on the morning of the surrender by\r\nbeing put in charge of the prisoners. A published correspondence from the\r\nprisoners proves with what kindness and courtesy to the unfortunate this\r\ntask was performed. A testimony to a similar effect is the correspondence\r\nfrom the leading residents of the rebel counties of Owen, Grant, Carroll\r\nand Gallatin, in Kentucky, which in the Winter of 1861, were placed under\r\nhis command, and which he ruled with such firmness, yet moderation, that\r\nboth Union men and rebels bore witness to his conservative, moderate, and\r\ngentlemanly course, as well as to his promptness and decision.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Shiloh, Colonel Whittlesey, on the second day of that\r\ndesperate fight, commanded the third brigade of General Wallace's\r\ndivision. The part borne by this brigade in the battle has become\r\nhistoric. It was composed of Ohio troops, the 20th, 56th 76th, and 78th\r\nregiments, and it was against their line that General Beauregard attempted\r\nto throw the whole weight of his force for a last desperate charge, when\r\nhe was driven back by the terrible fire poured into him. General Wallace,\r\nin his officiai report, makes especial and honorable mention of the\r\nimportant part taken by this brigade and its commander in the battle.\r\n\r\nSoon after the battle Colonel Whittlesey sent in his resignation, which\r\nhe had intended sending in earlier, but withheld because he foresaw some\r\nimportant military movements in which he desired to take part. The\r\ncritical condition of his wife's health and his own disabilities, which\r\nhad reached a point threatening soon to unfit him for any service\r\nwhatever, compelled him to take this step. After the battle of Shiloh,\r\nwhen he could resign with honor and without detriment to the service, he\r\nsent in his resignation. General regret was expressed by the officers with\r\nwhom he had been associated and by his old command. The application was\r\nendorsed by General Grant \"We cannot afford to lose so good an officer.\"\r\nGeneral Wallace, General Cox, and General Force added their commendations\r\nof his abilities and services, and few officers retired from the army with\r\na clearer or more satisfactory record, or with greater regret on the part\r\nof his military associates.\r\n\r\nSince his retirement, Colonel Whittlesey has been leisurely engaged in\r\nscientific and literary pursuits, has again spent much time in geological\r\nexplorations in the Lake Superior and Upper Mississippi country, has\r\norganized and brought into successful operation the Western Reserve\r\nHistorical Society, of which he continues to be president, and has\r\naccumulated in its spacious hall a good collection of historical works\r\nrelating to the West, and a rich collection of geological and antiquarian\r\nspecimens, gathered in Ohio and the Northwest.\r\n\r\nColonel Whittlesey has contributed largely to scientific literature, and\r\nhis works have attracted wide attention, not only among scientific men of\r\nAmerica, but of Europe. His published works are to be found in the\r\nGeological Reports of Ohio, 1838-9; United States Geological Surveys of\r\nthe Upper Mississippi, D. D. Owen, 1847, 1849; United States Geological\r\nSurveys of Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Foster and Whitney, 1850, 1851;\r\nLife of John Fitch, Spark's American Biography, new series, Volume 6,\r\n1845; Fugitive Essays, mainly historical, published at Hudson, Ohio, 8vo.,\r\npp. 357, 1854; Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge;--Ancient Works of\r\nOhio, 1852; Fluctuation of Lake Levels, 1860; Ancient Mining on Lake\r\nSuperior, 1863; Fresh Water Glacial Drift, 1866. In addition to these are\r\nan essay on the Mineral Resources of the Rocky Mountains, in 1863; a\r\nhandsome and valuable volume on the Early History of Cleveland, in 1866,\r\nand about thirty essays, reports, and pamphlets, besides very numerous and\r\nvaluable contributions to newspapers and scientific journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral James Barnett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Barnett was born on the 21st of June, 1821, at Cherry Valley, Otsego\r\ncounty, New York. He came to Cleveland when about four years of age, and\r\nafter receiving a common school education commenced his business career by\r\nentering the hardware store of Potter, Clark & Murfey, where he served\r\nthree years as clerk. At the end of that time he went into the hardware\r\nhouse of George Worthington, and has for many years been a member of the\r\nfirm of George Worthington & Co. As a business man and good citizen he\r\nstands very high in the estimation of the people of Cleveland, but it is\r\nwith his military record that we have now chiefly to deal.\r\n\r\nIn 1840, an independent Company of artillery was organized in Cleveland,\r\nand at its start was made a part of the old Cleveland Grays, afterwards\r\nthe artillery part formed a company by itself, which had for its\r\ncommanders D. L. Wood and A. S. Sanford. This organization was kept up\r\nuntil the breaking out of the war, and was, without doubt, the best\r\ndrilled and equipped artillery organization west of the mountains; the\r\nState supplied the guns, harness and caissons, but the expenses for\r\nhorses, the meeting and drill houses, and equipments, and all their\r\nexpenses, were paid by themselves. They drilled regularly, took an\r\nexcursion every year, visited Niagara, Syracuse, Sandusky, Wooster, and\r\nalso Chicago, on the occasion of the assembling of the River and Harbor\r\nConvention. At every point they visited they never failed to infuse a\r\nmilitary spirit into the people, and to create a desire for similar\r\ncompanies. Nearly all the artillery organizations of the West sprang out\r\nof this little nucleus at Cleveland, for at the places visited and\r\ninstructed by the Cleveland company, men were obtained at the breaking out\r\nof the war who were to some extent familiar with artillery drill, and many\r\nof them became, because of this, commanders during the rebellion. Such\r\ncommanders were to be found throughout the service.\r\n\r\nAbout two years before the war, the Ohio militia law was so amended as to\r\npermit the organization of artillery companies, with one gun to a company,\r\nevery six guns to form a command, entitled to elect a colonel,\r\nlieutenant-colonel, and major. The Cleveland Light Artillery took\r\nimmediate advantage of this by organizing into the First, Regiment Light\r\nArtillery, O. V. M., with the following officers: Colonel, James Barnett;\r\nLieutenant Colonel, S. B. Sturges; Major, Clark Gates; Quartermaster, Amos\r\nTownsend; Quartermaster's Sergeant, Randall Crawford; Co. A, Captain Wm.\r\nR. Simmons; Co. B, Captain John G. Mack; Co. C, Captain D. Kenny; Co. D,\r\nCaptain Percy Rice; Co. E, Captain F. W. Pelton. The three city companies\r\ndrilled at what is now the Varieties, on Frankfort street, Captain\r\nPelton's company at Brooklyn, and Captain Kenny's at Geneva.\r\n\r\nIn the Winter of 1860, the regiment tendered their services to the State\r\nauthorities in case of difficulty, as the rebels in West Virginia were\r\nassuming a threatening attitude. This offer was accepted, but the opinion\r\nexpressed in the acceptance, that the proffered services would probably\r\nnot be needed. Five days after the fall of Fort Sumter the order came for\r\nthe regiment to report with its six guns to Columbus. On the second day\r\nafter the date of the order the organization, with full complement of men\r\nand guns, passed through Columbus en route to Marietta, where a rebel\r\ndemonstration was expected. Here it remained a little over a month, when a\r\ndetachment with two guns, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Sturges,\r\ncrossed into West Virginia at Parkersburg, and the remainder, under\r\ncommand of Colonel Barnett, crossed the river at Benwood and proceeded to\r\nGrafton, West Virginia. The two guns under Lieutenant Colonel Sturges went\r\nup the Baltimore and Ohio line to Philippi, and in the affair at that\r\nplace did telling service. Theirs was the first artillery fired in the\r\nfield by the National forces in the war of the rebellion. About a month\r\nafter, the detachment rejoined the main body of the regiment, and the guns\r\nof the artillery did good service in the attack on the rebels at Laurel\r\nHill, the result being the hasty flight of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit from Laurel Hill, two pieces pushed over the mountains and\r\npressed their rear guard with great energy for two days, during nearly the\r\nwhole time in a drenching rain, deep mud, and through fords, the men all\r\nanxiety to overtake the fleeing foes. The rebels had felled trees to\r\nobstruct the road. Some chopped the trees asunder, some helped the guns\r\nthrough the mud, and all worked like desperate men. Finally the\r\ntransportation of the rebels stuck fast in quicksand and stopped the whole\r\ntrain. The rebels were compelled to make a stand to protect their baggage.\r\nTo effect this they drew up their forces on a little table land, near\r\nCarrick's Ford--the position being hid by a row of bushes on the edge of\r\nthe hill, and overlooking the line of Colonel Barnett's command. The head\r\nof the column was pushing on with great impetuosity when they were\r\nsuddenly opened upon from the point of land on their right hand, but,\r\nfortunately, from the elevation, their fire mostly passed over their\r\nheads. The troops were immediately put into position to repel the attack;\r\nthe guns, to give them scope, were wheeled out into the field and opened\r\nfire immediately with canister. Although fired upon by two pieces of\r\nartillery from the eminence, they lost no one, and after a few rounds the\r\nrebel guns were silenced, and the gallant attack by the infantry under\r\nColonel Steadman of the 14th Ohio, Colonel Dumont, 6th Indiana, and\r\nColonel Milroy, 9th Indiana, at the same time, drove them from their\r\nposition. When taken, it was found that the gunner of one piece had been\r\nkilled and was lying across the trunnions of the piece with the cartridge\r\nonly half rammed--the horses having been killed at the same time and in\r\nfalling broke the pole, so that it was impossible to get the gun away. Our\r\nmen soon improvised another pole and harness, hitched some mules to the\r\npiece, and brought it away, together with the captured supplies. The\r\npursuing column returned to camp at Laurel Hill.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this, Colonel Barnett was ordered to report to General\r\nMcClellan in person, at Beverly. There a consultation was had on the\r\npolicy of taking the artillery on a campaign up the Kanawha, after General\r\nWise. There was some question about ordering them on the campaign, from\r\nthe fact that they were not in the United States command, their\r\norganization then not having been recognized by the General Government.\r\nThey were Ohio troops, and their invasion of West Virginia was excused on\r\nthe plea that it was necessary to the \"defence of the State,\" for which\r\npurpose only they were mustered into the State service.\r\n\r\nWhile the matter of a new campaign was being submitted to the command, the\r\nbattle of Bull's Run took place, and McClellan was peremptorily ordered to\r\nWashington to take command of the army of the Potomac. Colonel Barnett\r\nreturned to Columbus with his command, which was mustered in and mustered\r\nout of the United States service on the same day.\r\n\r\nThis affair, in connection with the operation at Rich Mountain, under\r\nRosecrans, closed the campaign made by General McClellan in Western\r\nVirginia, and preserved the State to the Union.\r\n\r\nColonel Barnett and his command returned to Cleveland, bringing with them,\r\nby permission of Governor Dennison, the piece of artillery captured at\r\nCarrick's Ford, which still remains in Cleveland and is used for firing\r\nsalutes. On reaching Cleveland the returning soldiers were received with\r\npublic demonstrations of joy, and a vote of thanks, couched in the\r\nstrongest terms of commendation, was unanimously adopted by the city\r\ncouncil at their regular meeting, July 30, 1861.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dennison had strongly urged the General Government to grant him\r\npermission to furnish a twelve battery regiment of artillery as part of\r\nthe State quota of troops. This was steadily refused for a considerable\r\ntime, but at length a Mr. Sherwin, of Cincinnati, was granted permission\r\nto raise such a regiment, provided he could do it within a stated time.\r\nThe attempt proving a failure, Governor Dennison obtained permission from\r\nthe War Department to appoint Colonel Barnett to the task. Colonel Barnett\r\nat once left for Columbus, and in August, 1861, commenced the work of\r\nrecruiting and equipping, the batteries being sent to the field as rapidly\r\nas they could be got ready. Co. A and Co. C reported to General Thomas in\r\ntime to participate in the battle of Mill Springs, Kentucky. The other\r\nbatteries were sent to different commands in Western Virginia and\r\nKentucky, as soon as ready.\r\n\r\nColonel Barnett reported to General Buell, at Louisville, the following\r\nSpring, with a portion of the command, and on the arrival of the army at\r\nNashville, in March, he was placed in command of the Artillery Reserve of\r\nthe Army of the Ohio, in which capacity he served until ordered to Ohio,\r\nin July, 1862, on recruiting service, and was in command through the\r\ncampaign embracing the battles of Pittsburgh Landing, Corinth and other\r\naffairs, up to the time of the occupation of Huntsville by Buell's army.\r\n\r\nAfter having obtained the requisite number of recruits for his regiment,\r\nhe was assigned to duty, in September, upon the staff of General C. C.\r\nGilbert, at that time commanding the centre corps of the Army of the Ohio.\r\nAfter the battle of Perryville, the Colonel was transferred to the staff\r\nof Major General McCook, as Chief of Artillery, which position he filled\r\nuntil November 24, 1862, when he was designated by General Rosecrans,\r\nChief of Artillery of the army of the Cumberland.\r\n\r\nIn the battles of Stone River, Chickamauga, Mission Ridge, and the various\r\nother operations of the grand old army of the Cumberland, Colonel Barnett\r\nwas constantly and actively engaged, and is mentioned with special\r\ncommendation by General Rosecrans in his official report, and received the\r\nconfidence and support of the final commander of that department, the\r\nsturdy and gallant Thomas.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of operations around Chattanooga, Colonel Barnett was put\r\nin command of the artillery of the department, requiring reorganization\r\nand remounting, which was formed in two divisions, consisting of six\r\nbatteries in a division; the first division being batteries in the regular\r\nservice; the second division being volunteer batteries, and principally\r\ncomposed of batteries of the First Ohio Light Artillery, having their\r\ncamps near the city of Nashville, where they were thoroughly drilled,\r\nreorganized and equipped, and held in readiness for the field at any\r\nmoment on requisition of the department commander; which command he\r\nretained until mustered out of the service, October 20, 1864.\r\n\r\nColonel Barnett also participated in the battle of Nashville, in which,\r\nhowever, he acted in a volunteer capacity, the battle having taken place\r\nsubsequent to his muster out of the service.\r\n\r\nSubsequently he was awarded a Brevet Brigadier Generalship, in\r\nconsideration of his eminent abilities and the valuable services he had\r\nperformed. On his return home he resumed his position in the old firm,\r\nhaving, by the generosity of his partners, been allowed to retain his\r\ninterest without detriment during the whole time of his service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Wm. H. Hayward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWm. H. Hayward was born at Lebanon, Connecticut, in 1824, was brought to\r\nCleveland in 1826, received a good common school education, and at the\r\nage of fifteen became an apprentice to the printing business in the\r\noffice of Sanford & Lott. At the end of his five years apprenticeship he\r\nwas admitted as partner, solely because of his proficiency, not having\r\nany capital to put in. Mr. Lott retired on account of ill health, and the\r\nfirm became Sanford & Hayward, which it has ever since remained, and\r\nwhich has steadily built up a large and profitable blank-book and\r\nlithographing business.\r\n\r\nFrom boyhood Mr. Hayward had a taste for military studies, and he was\r\nearly connected with the military organizations of the city. In the early\r\ndays of the Cleveland Light Artillery, when it was under the command of\r\nhis partner, General A. S. Sanford, he was First Lieutenant. When\r\npermission was received for the organization of the First Ohio Artillery\r\nas a three years regiment, Mr. Hayward was tendered, and from a sheer\r\nsense of duty to the country accepted, the Lieutenant Colonelcy of the\r\nregiment. He took an active part in recruiting, drilling, and organizing\r\nthe men as fast as received, and sending them to the front. When the\r\nregiment was divided and sent in different directions his command was\r\nordered to the Shenandoah Valley to report to General Shields. Under this\r\ncommand he took part in the fight at Port Republic, June 12, 1862, fought\r\nwhilst another battle was going on at Cross Keys, seven miles distant.\r\nSoon afterwards he and his command became part of the Army of the Potomac,\r\nbeing attached to the Third Division under General Whipple, who was\r\nsubsequently mortally wounded at Chancellorsville. On being assigned to\r\nthat Division, Colonel Hayward was made Chief of Artillery. At the time of\r\nthe battle of Gettysburg Colonel Hayward was assigned to duty in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nHis health, never good, having completely broken down, he was compelled to\r\nresign and return home. Here he remained attending his business duties and\r\nrendering such aid as lay in his power until the call for hundred days\r\ntroops to defend Washington. At the time he was in command of the 29th\r\nRegiment Ohio Volunteer Militia, organized for just such emergencies, and\r\nwhich contained eight companies. With these two other companies were\r\nConsolidated, and the organization styled the 150th Ohio National Guards.\r\nColonel Hayward led it to Washington, and took a leading part in the\r\nrepulse of Early. The attack of the rebel forces was mainly against that\r\npart of the defences garrisoned by the 150th Regiment. There were no hopes\r\nof permanently keeping the rebels out of Washington with so small a force,\r\nbut the main object was to keep them at bay until succor could arrive. To\r\ndo this strategy was adopted. About eight hundred quartermaster's men,\r\ndarkeys and teamsters, were sent off from Washington to swell the force;\r\nthese men were kept marching and counter-marching around a piece of wood,\r\nthen wheeled around and brought again into the view of the rebels, who,\r\nthinking there was a large force being massed there, deferred the attack\r\ntill morning, when the veteran Sixth corps came up to their relief, and\r\nEarly was driven back in discomfiture.\r\n\r\nOn the expiration of their term of service the 150th National Guards\r\nreturned to Cleveland, and Colonel Hayward resumed business life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Wm. R. Creighton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Infantry regiment raised in Cleveland became so thoroughly identified\r\nwith Cleveland as the \"Fighting Seventh.\" This was in great measure due to\r\nthe fact that it was the first complete regiment sent from Cleveland, and\r\nthat it contained a large number of the spirited young men of the city,\r\ntaken from all classes of the population. The fortunes of the Seventh were\r\nfollowed with deep interest, their successes exulted in, and their losses\r\nmourned over. No public sorrow, saving that for the death of President\r\nLincoln, was so general and deep as that which followed the news of the\r\nfall of the gallant leaders of the \"old Seventh,\" as they led their\r\nhandful of men, spared from numerous murderous battles, in the face of\r\ncertain death up the hill at Ringgold. Grief for the loss was mingled with\r\nindignation at the stupidity or wanton cruelty that had sent brave men to\r\nsuch needless slaughter.\r\n\r\nWilliam R. Creighton, with whom the history of the Seventh is identified,\r\nwas born in Pittsburgh, in June, 1837. At ten years old he was placed in a\r\nshoe store where he remained two years and then was placed for six months\r\nin a commercial college. From there he entered a printing office, where he\r\nserved an apprenticeship of four years, and came to Cleveland, where he\r\nentered the Herald office, remaining there, with the exception of a few\r\nmonths, until just previous to the breaking out of the war.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, he became a member of the Cleveland Light Guards and rose to\r\nbecome a lieutenant in that organization. He was a great favorite with his\r\nfellow members of the company, and was not only a genial companion, but an\r\nexcellent disciplinarian. At the breaking out of the war, he organized a\r\ncompany with the old Cleveland Light Guards as a nucleus, and soon had so\r\nmany applications that his company was full and a second company was\r\norganized. A third company was also recruited. This was the beginning of\r\nthe Seventh Ohio.\r\n\r\nOn a beautiful Sunday morning, in May, 1861, the Seventh marched through\r\nthe streets of Cleveland, the first full regiment that had left the city,\r\non the way to the railroad. The whole population turned out to bid them\r\nfarewell. The regiment went to Camp Dennison, unarmed, without\r\nuniforms--except such uniforms as belonged to the old independent\r\norganizations--and with but temporary regimental organization. When but a\r\nfew days in Camp Dennison, the call came for three years troops, and the\r\nregiment, with but few exceptions, volunteered for the three years\r\nservice, with E. B. Tyler as Colonel, and Wm. E. Creighton as Lieutenant\r\nColonel. The places of those who declined to enlist for three years were\r\nsoon filled by fresh recruits.\r\n\r\nThe regiment was ordered to West Virginia to take part in the campaign to\r\nbe opened there. Colonel Tyler had gone in advance, and Lieutenant Colonel\r\nCreighton took the regiment to Clarksburg, where he turned it over to his\r\ncommanding officer. At Glenville he again took command, drilling the men\r\ndaily when in camp, and bringing them into a high state of proficiency.\r\nHard marching and many privations were endured until the regiment reached\r\nCross Lanes.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of August orders were received to join General Cox, at Gauley\r\nBridge. The regiment, then under command of Colonel Tyler, had reached\r\nTwenty-mile Creek when word was received that the rebels, four thousand\r\nstrong, were preparing to cross the river at Cross Lanes, which the\r\nSeventh had so recently left. A counter-march was ordered. About six miles\r\nfrom Cross Lanes the regiment was attacked by an overwhelming force, and\r\nafter a desperate fight was broken, and compelled to retreat in two\r\ndifferent directions, with a loss of a hundred and twenty men in killed,\r\nwounded, and prisoners. Creighton was among those who escaped.\r\n\r\nThe scattered companies re-united at Charleston, West Virginia, where they\r\nremained waiting orders, and were in the meantime thoroughly drilled by\r\nLieutenant Colonel Creighton, who was in fact, if not in title, the\r\ncommanding officer of the regiment. An order coming for five hundred\r\npicked men of the regiment to join in the pursuit of Floyd, he was sent in\r\ncommand of the detachment, was given the advance in the pursuit, and\r\nfollowed Floyd's trail hotly for several days, marching on foot at the\r\nhead of his men. Soon after this Tyler became Brigadier General and\r\nCreighton was made Colonel of his regiment, which was ordered to the East.\r\n\r\nAt Winchester, Creighton led his regiment, the first in the famous charge\r\nof the Third Brigade, having a horse shot under him, and then fighting on\r\nfoot with a musket, among his men, until the time came to assume the\r\nposition of commanding officer again. In the march to Fredricksburgh and\r\nthe return to the Valley he shared every privation and hardship the men\r\nwere obliged to encounter, always refuse to take advantage of his\r\nprivileges as an officer. He endeavored to procure every needful comfort\r\nfor his men, but when they were barefooted and hungry he shared his\r\nstores with them, and fought and marched on foot with them. At Port\r\nRepublic he headed his regiment in five desperate charges, in each of\r\nthem driving the enemy. In the battle of Cedar Mountain Creighton handled\r\nhis regiment with a dexterity that told fearfully on the ranks of the\r\nenemy. He was finally severely wounded, and compelled to leave the field.\r\nIn doing so, he kept his face to the foe, saying that \"no rebel ever saw\r\nhis back in battle; and never would.\" He was taken to Washington, where\r\nthe bullet was extracted from his side, which was an exceedingly painful\r\noperation. Soon after this he came to his home; but while still carrying\r\nhis arm in a sling, he reported to his regiment. While at home the battle\r\nof Antietam was fought, which was the only one in which he failed to\r\nparticipate. Soon after his return, the affair at Dumfries occurred,\r\nwhere, through his ingenuity and skill, Hampton's cavalry command was\r\ndefeated by a mere handful of men. For this he was publicly thanked by\r\nGenerals Slocum and Geary. He took part in the battle of\r\nChancellorsville, where he won new laurels. It is said that being ordered\r\nby General Hooker to fall back, he refused to do so until able to bring\r\nKnapp's Battery safely to the rear; for which disobedience of orders he\r\nwas recommended for promotion. This battery was from his native city, and\r\nin it he had many friends. Next he was at Gettysburg, where he fought\r\nwith his accustomed valor. He was also at Lookout Mountain and Mission\r\nRidge, in \"Hooker's battle above the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this battle came the pursuit of Bragg, whose rear-guard was\r\novertaken at Ringgold, Georgia, where it was securely posted on the top of\r\nTaylor's Ridge--a naked eminence. It was madness to undertake to drive\r\nthem from this hill, without the use of artillery to cover the assault;\r\nbut in the excitement of the moment the order was given. In this assault\r\nCreighton commanded a brigade. Forming his command he made a speech.\r\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"we are ordered to take that hill. I want to see you walk\r\nright up it.\" After this characteristic speech, he led his men up the\r\nhill. It soon became impossible to advance against the terrible fire by\r\nwhich they were met; he therefore led them into a ravine, but the rebels\r\npoured such a fire into it from all sides, that the command was driven\r\nback. Reaching a fence, Creighton stopped, and facing the foe, waited for\r\nhis command to reach the opposite side. While in this position he fell,\r\npierced through the body with a rifle bullet. His last words were: \"Oh,\r\nmy dear wife!\" and he expired almost immediately. The brigade now fell\r\nrapidly back, carrying the remains of its idolized commander with it.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Crane fell in the same fight and but just after\r\nCreighton fell.\r\n\r\nThe bodies were taken to the rear and sent to Cleveland, where they were\r\ngiven such a reception and funeral as had never been witnessed in\r\nCleveland before, or after. The whole city was in mourning, and after\r\nlying in state in Council Hall, to be visited by thousands, the mortal\r\nremains of the dead heroes were borne, amid the firing of minute guns, the\r\ntolling of bells, and the solemn dirges of the band, to their last resting\r\nplace in Woodland cemetery.\r\n\r\nColonel Creighton was killed on November 27th, 1863, in the\r\ntwenty-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Orrin J. Crane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrrin J. Crane was born in Troy, New York, in 1829. When he was three\r\nyears old his parents removed to Vermont, where his father died soon\r\nafter, leaving his wife and children poorly provided for. Young Crane was\r\ntaken, whilst still a small boy, by an uncle, and about the year 1852, he\r\ncame in charge of his relative to Conneaut, where he worked as a mechanic.\r\nHe left Conneaut at one time for the Isthmus of Panama, where he spent a\r\nyear, and on returning found work as a ship carpenter in Cleveland, where\r\nhe became connected with one of the military organizations of the city.\r\n\r\nAt the fall of Sumter he entered the service as first-lieutenant in\r\nCaptain Creighton's company; and on his promotion, was made captain. He\r\nearly devoted himself to the instruction of his company; and it can be\r\nsaid that it lost nothing of the efficiency it acquired under the\r\nleadership of Creighton.\r\n\r\nAfter the regiment entered the field, his services were invaluable. If a\r\nbridge was to be constructed, or a road repaired, he was sent for to\r\nsuperintend it. If the commissary department became reduced, he was the\r\none to procure supplies. No undertaking was too arduous for his iron-will\r\nto brave. All relied on him with the utmost confidence, and no one was\r\never disappointed in him.\r\n\r\nAt the affair at Cross Lanes, where he first came under fire, he behaved\r\nwith great valor, and inspired his men with true courage. They stood like\r\na wall, and fell back only when ordered by their leader, then dashed\r\nthrough the strong lines of the enemy, and were brought off with safety\r\nout of what was seemingly certain destruction. He kept his men well\r\ntogether during the long march to Gauley Bridge.\r\n\r\nAfter his arrival at that point he was sent out to the front, up New\r\nRiver, where he rendered valuable service. He was in every march and\r\nskirmish in both Western and Eastern Virginia, until the battle of\r\nWinchester. In this engagement he showed the same indomitable courage. He\r\nheld his men to the work of carnage so fearfully, that the enemy's slain\r\nalmost equalled his command.\r\n\r\nHe shared in every battle in which his regiment was engaged in the East;\r\nPort Republic, Cedar Mountain (where he was slightly wounded), Antietam,\r\nDumfries, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg. In all of these he never sent\r\nhis men forward; he led them on.\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Antietam, he commanded the regiment, and during the\r\nlatter part of the engagement, a brigade. Before the regiment left for the\r\nWest, he was made lieutenant-colonel; a position which his ability and\r\nlong, as well as faithful, service of his country rendered him eminently\r\nqualified to fill.\r\n\r\nArriving at the West, he commanded the regiment in the battles of Lookout\r\nMountain and Mission Ridge, where he added new laurels to his already\r\nimperishable name. At fatal Ringgold, he again commanded the regiment. He\r\nled it up the steep ascent, where the whistling of bullets made the air\r\nmusical; and where men dropped so quietly that they were scarcely missed,\r\nexcept in the thinned ranks of the command. The regiment had not recovered\r\nfrom the shock produced by the announcement of the death of Creighton,\r\nwhen Crane himself fell dead at the feet of his comrades, pierced through\r\nthe forhead by a rifle bullet. He fell so far in the advance, that his men\r\nwere driven back before possessing themselves of his body but it was soon\r\nafter recovered, and shared with the remains of Colonel Creighton the\r\nhonors of a public funeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Military Men of Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn selecting the five subjects for the foregoing military biographical\r\nsketches it was not intended to single them out as all that were worthy of\r\nmention for their services. There are numerous others deserving a place,\r\nbut the materials for full biographical sketches were wanting for most of\r\nthem, and it was thought best, therefore, to confine the separate sketches\r\nto those military men who, for one reason or another, have come to be\r\nconsidered the representative men in the military history of the city. We\r\nadd here brief mention of a few others, from such material as is in our\r\nposession, and must then, doubtless, omit many equally worthy a place.\r\n\r\nBrevet Brigadier Russell Hastings, though not entering the army from\r\nCleveland, is now a resident of the city and holds the position of United\r\nStates Marshal. He was commissioned Second Lieutenant in the 23rd Ohio\r\nInfantry, commanded at first by Major-General Rosecrans and subsequently\r\nby General Hayes, rose by regular promotion to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy,\r\nand was subsequently made Brevet Brigadier General \"for gallant and\r\nmeretorious services at the battle of Opequan, Virginia.\" General Hastings\r\nwas permanently disabled by a bullet wound in the leg.\r\n\r\nBrevet Brigadier Robert L. Kimberly was on the editorial staff of the\r\nCleveland Herald when he joined the 41st Ohio Infantry, as Second\r\nLieutenant under Colonel Hazen, was rapidly promoted to Major, in which\r\nrank he had charge of his regiment during the greater part of the time,\r\nand sometimes acting as brigade commander. He was made Lieutenant Colonel\r\nJanuary 1, 1865, and Colonel of the 191st Ohio Infantry in the succeeding\r\nMarch. He participated with distinction in several engagements, and for\r\nthese services was breveted Brigadier General.\r\n\r\nBrigadier General Oliver H. Payne was commissioned Colonel of the 124th\r\nOhio Infantry January 1, 1863. His regiment was distinguished for its\r\ndiscipline and for the care taken of the men by Colonel Payne and\r\nLieutenant Colonel James Pickands, and also for its gallant services under\r\nthose leaders. At Chickamauga Colonel Payne was wounded and, being unable\r\nto rejoin his regiment, resigned his position in November, 1864. He was\r\nsubsequently breveted Brigadier General for meritorious services.\r\n\r\nAmong those who distinguished themselves in the service, but who stopped\r\nshort of null rank of those mentioned above, may be mentioned Major James\r\nB. Hampson, who commanded the Cleveland Grays in the three years'\r\norganization of the 1st Ohio Infantry, and subsequently was Major of the\r\n124th Ohio. Lieutenant Colonel James T. Sterling, who commenced his\r\nmilitary career as company commander in the 7th Ohio Infantry and\r\nsubsequently became Lieutenant Colonel of the 103rd Ohio, from which\r\nposition he was appointed null General on the staff of General Cox.\r\nCaptain Joseph B. Molyneaux, who served with gallantry in the 7th Ohio\r\nInfantry. Captain Mervin Clark, the fearless \"boy officer\" of the same\r\nregiment, who braved death on every occasion, and fell, colors in hand,\r\nwhen leading a forlorn hope over a rebel work at Franklin. Lieutenant\r\nColonel Frank Lynch, of the 27th Ohio Infantry. Lieutenant Colonel G. S.\r\nMygatt, of the 41st Ohio Infantry, who died of disease contracted in\r\nserving his country. Major J. H. Williston, of the same regiment. Captains\r\nG. L. Childs, Alfred P. Girty, and G. L. Heaton, of the 67th Ohio Infantry.\r\nLieutenant Colonel John N. Frazee, of the 84th and 150th Ohio Infantry.\r\nLieutenant Colonel H. S. Pickands, of the 103rd Ohio Infantry, and Colonel\r\nJames Pickands, of the 124th Ohio, who reached their positions by active\r\nservice in various ranks throughout the war. Captain Isaac C. Vail, of the\r\n103rd Ohio Infantry, who died in service. Major George Arnold of the 107th\r\nOhio Infantry, (German,) who fought with great gallantry. Surgeon C. A.\r\nHartman, whose skill as a surgeon was fully equalled by his valor as a\r\nsoldier, and who, unable to content himself as a non-combatant, engaged in\r\nthe thickest of the fight at Winchester and was killed in the terrible\r\nslaughter the regiment experienced. Captain Wm. C. Bunts, of the 125th\r\nOhio Infantry. Lieutenant Colonel E. A. Scovill, of the 128th Ohio\r\nInfantry, rendered important service in charge of the null affairs of the\r\ngreat prison for the rebels on Johnson's Island. Major Junius R. Sanford\r\nwas in service in this regiment. Lieutenant Colonel George L. Hayward, of\r\nthe 129th Ohio Infantry, had seen active service as company commander in\r\nthe 1st Ohio Infantry. In the Cavalry service Cleveland furnished among\r\nother leading regimental officers Colonel Charles Doubleday, Lieutenant\r\nColonel G. G. Minor, Major Albert Barnitz, now in the United States\r\nservice, Major L. C. Thayer, who died soon after his leaving the service,\r\nand Major J. F. Herrick. To the Artillery service, in addition to General\r\nBarnett and Lieutenant Colonel Hayward, Cleveland contributed Lieutenant\r\nColonel Walter E. Lawrence, who declined promotion and died deeply\r\nregretted by his comrades in arms and by a host of warm friends at home.\r\nMajor Seymour Race, who ably assisted in the organization of the regiment\r\nand left Camp Dennison January 10, 1862, with two batteries and reported\r\nto General Buell at Louisville; had command of the camp at the Fair\r\nGrounds, composed of seven batteries from Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin;\r\nleft Louisville February 10, with three batteries on steamers, and\r\nreported to General Nelson at the mouth of Salt River accompanying him to\r\nNashville; was Chief of Artillery of General T. J. Wood's Division at\r\nPittsburgh Landing and the siege of Corinth and continued in that position\r\nin the division through Northern Alabama and back to Louisville;\r\nparticipated in the battles of Perryville and Stone River; was highly\r\ncommended by his Division commander for valuable services in all these\r\nactions; and was also in command of the fortifications at Nashville for\r\nabout five months; Major Warren P. Edgerton, Major W. F. Goodspeed,\r\nAssistant Surgeon Charles E. Ames, Captains Wm. A. Standart, Louis\r\nHeckman, Norman A. Baldwin, Joseph C. Shields, Frank Wilson, Louis\r\nSmithnight, William Backus, and a long list of Lieutenants. From the fact\r\nthat the Cleveland Light Artillery organization was the origin of the\r\nLight Artillery service of the State, and that the Artillery had long been\r\npopular in the city, the Ohio Light Artillery service in the war was very\r\nlargely officered and heavily recruited from Cleveland. In the 5th U. S.\r\nColored Infantry, officered by white soldiers of Ohio, Gustave W. Fahrion,\r\nwho had done good service in an Ohio regiment, was appointed Captain, and\r\ndid hard service with his men in Virginia and North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJournalism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would require more space than can be given here to merely enumerate the\r\ndifferent newspaper ventures that have been set afloat in Cleveland, some\r\nto disappear almost as soon as launched, others to buffet the waves for a\r\nfew months, or even years, and then to pass away and be forgotten. In the\r\ndays when nothing more was required to start a newspaper than a few pounds\r\nof type and a hand press, or credit with the owner of a press, new\r\njournals appeared and disappeared with great rapidity. Even now, when it\r\nis hopeless to think of attempting the establishment of a journal without\r\nfirst sinking a large capital, there are people venturesome enough to try\r\nthe experiment of starting a newspaper upon little or nothing. The end of\r\nsuch experiments is always the same.\r\n\r\nThe first newspaper issued in Cleveland was the Cleveland Gazette and\r\nCommercial Register, commenced July 31, 1818. It was ostensibly a weekly\r\npublication, but the difficulty of procuring paper with the desired\r\nregularity, and other untoward circumstances, sometimes caused a lapse of\r\nten, fourteen, and even more days between each issue. In October, 1819,\r\nthe Cleveland Herald was started as a weekly, by Z. Willes & Co.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 1836, the Daily Gazette was issued. This ran until March\r\n22, 1837, when its owner, Charles Whittlesey, united it with the Herald,\r\nunder the name of the Daily Herald and Gazette, the new firm being\r\nWhittlesey & Hull, and after a few days Whittlesey & J. A. Harris. The\r\nGazette title was subsequently dropped, and that of the Herald preserved,\r\nMr. Harris being the sole proprietor and editor. Messrs. W. J. May, A. W.\r\nFairbanks, G. A. Benedict and John Coon were at different times added to\r\nthe firm, Mr. May and Coon afterwards retiring, and being followed after\r\nsome years by Mr. Harris, who was the veteran editor of the city. The\r\nHerald is now the oldest paper in the city, and the oldest daily in\r\nNorthern Ohio. It was always Whig or Republican in politics.\r\n\r\nThe Cleveland Plain Dealer was the natural successor of the Cleveland\r\nDaily Advertiser, a Democratic paper published about a third of a century\r\nsince, by Canfield & Spencer. The Plain Dealer was owned and edited from\r\nits start by J. W. Gray, who made it a sharp and spicy journal. His\r\ndeclining health compelled him to take less interest in his paper, which\r\nsoon lost prestige, and having gone into incompetent hands after Mr.\r\nGray's death, it was before long compelled to suspend. Being purchased,\r\nafter a short suspension, by Mr. Armstrong, it was resuscitated, and is at\r\npresent, under the ownership and management of Messrs. Armstrong & Green,\r\na successful enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Leader dates its origin on one side to the True Democrat, an\r\nIndependent Free Soil paper, dating back over twenty years, and on the\r\nother to the Daily Forest City, a \"Silver Gray Whig,\" started about 1852,\r\nby Joseph and James Medill. After some coquetting an alliance was formed\r\nbetween the two papers, and the name of Forest City Democrat adopted for\r\nthe Consolidated paper which was afterwards changed to the Leader. None of\r\nthose connected with either of the original papers are now connected with\r\nthe Leader. Of those who became the publishers of the latter paper Mr. E.\r\nCowles retains his connection and is the largest proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe German Wachter am Erie completes the list of regular daily papers now\r\npublished in Cleveland. The Herald is published morning and evening, there\r\nbeing two editions of the evening issue. The Leader is issued in the\r\nmorning with an evening edition under the name of the News. The Plain\r\nDealer publishes two editions in the afternoon, and the Wachter am Erie\r\none afternoon edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, A. W. Fairbanks]\r\n\r\n\r\nA. W. Fairbanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. W. Fairbanks, the senior proprietor of the Cleveland Herald, was born\r\nMarch 4, 1817, in Cornish, now Claremont, Sullivan county, New Hampshire.\r\nWhen twelve years old he entered a printing office in Waterford, Saratoga\r\ncounty, New York, with the purpose of learning the business. In those days\r\nit was held necessary to serve a regular apprenticeship as a preliminary\r\nto becoming a journeyman printer, and the apprentice had to pass through\r\nan ordeal to which the learner of the present day is a total stranger.\r\nThere were then no machine presses out of the city of New York, nor\r\nrollers for inking. The types were inked by dabbing with buckskin balls,\r\nas had been done since the invention of printing. Rollers were, however,\r\nintroduced within a short time of our young apprentice entering on his\r\ncourse of education as a printer.\r\n\r\nThe office in which he worked, owned by a man named Johnson, was for book\r\nand job printing, thus affording the apprentice an opportunity of\r\nacquiring a more extensive and varied knowledge of the business than could\r\nhave been acquired in a newspaper office. He had a taste for the life on\r\nwhich he had entered, and soon made rapid headway in obtaining a knowledge\r\nof the \"art preservative of all arts.\" He remained in the same office\r\nuntil it was discontinued. He afterwards went to Schenectady, Ballston,\r\nSpa, and Troy, following the fortunes of the man he was apprenticed to,\r\nbefore finishing his trade. His first situation, as a journeyman, was in\r\nRochester, New York.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, he removed from Rochester to Michigan, then a territory, and\r\nassumed charge of the job department of the Detroit Advertiser. In this\r\nposition he remained for a year, when he was induced to remove to Toledo.\r\n\r\nSome time previously an attempt had been made to establish the Toledo\r\nBlade as a newspaper. The town was young, and though giving promise of\r\nvigorous growth, was yet unable to make such a newspaper enterprise an\r\nassured success. About fifty numbers were issued, under several\r\nownerships, and then the enterprise sank, apparently to rise no more. Mr.\r\nFairbanks saw his opportunity and availed himself of it. Possessing\r\nhimself of what remained of the Blade establishment, he announced its\r\nrevival, got up and got out the first number himself, working it off on a\r\nhand press, and announced to the public that the Blade had this time \"come\r\nto stay.\" In spite of difficulties and discouragements he persisted in the\r\nwork he had undertaken, and in a short time had secured for the paper a\r\ngood circulation. There was in the office scarcely enough type to get out\r\na single issue; there was no imposing stone on which to make up the forms,\r\nand but one press to do all the work of the office. Mr. Fairbanks worked\r\ndiligently with brain and hands, wrote matter for the Blade, managed its\r\nmechanical details, and at the same time spent time, labor, and money in\r\nenlarging the capabilities of the office and building up a valuable\r\njob-printing business. In fourteen years he built up out of nothing, or\r\nnext to nothing, a newspaper with a profitable circulation and a wide\r\nreputation, a job office admitted to be one of the most complete in the\r\nState, having five presses and material abundant in quantity and\r\nunsurpassed in quality. The office had made money every year since his\r\nconnection with it, except in 1840, when he gave all his labor to the\r\nHarrison campaign.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Mr. Fairbanks left Toledo for Cleveland, and became connected\r\nwith the Cleveland Herald, then edited by J. A. Harris and W. J. May. He\r\nfound the establishment without a press, the newspaper being printed on\r\nthe press of M. C. Younglove, under a contract, giving him twelve and a\r\nhalf cents per token, Mr. Younglove having the only steam press in the\r\ncity. Land was purchased on Bank street and the present Herald building\r\nerected. The entire book and job office of Mr. Younglove was purchased, a\r\nHoe cylinder press for working the Herald purchased, and the establishment\r\nplaced on a footing for doing a greatly enlarged and constantly increasing\r\nbusiness. Additional and improved facilities were furnished yearly, to\r\nkeep pace with the rapidly increasing demands, the single cylinder\r\nnewspaper press was changed for a double cylinder, and that had been\r\nrunning but a short time when it proved insufficient for the rapid\r\nincrease of circulation, and its place was taken by a four cylinder, which\r\nremains the only press of the kind in Ohio outside of Cincinnati, and\r\nwhich is capable of running off ten thousand impressions per hour. From a\r\nsmall part of the building this establishment grew until it crowded out\r\nall other occupants; then the building itself was altered so as to\r\neconomise room, and finally additions made, doubling its size, the whole\r\nof the space being immediately filled with material, presses and machinery\r\ncontaining the latest improvements. From an entire valuation of six\r\nthousand dollars the establishment has reached an inventory value of about\r\na hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and from a newspaper without a press\r\nit has grown to an office with ten steam presses, a mammoth four-cylinder,\r\nand a large building crowded full with the best machinery and material\r\nrequired in a first-class printing office, giving employment to\r\nninety-five men, women and boys, and sending out the Morning Herald and\r\ntwo regular editions of the Daily Herald, every day, except Sunday,\r\nbesides a Tri-Weekly Herald and Weekly Herald.\r\n\r\nThe entire mechanical details of the establishment have, from his first\r\nconnection with the office, been under the control of Mr. Fairbanks, and\r\nhe feels a just pride in the perfection to which these details have been\r\nbrought. His heart is in his profession, and it is his constant study. No\r\nimprovement in it escapes his observation, and he is ever on the alert to\r\navail himself of everything promising to increase the efficiency of his\r\nestablishment. It is a noticeable fact, that the Herald has never missed a\r\ndaily issue, although at times during the war the scarcity of paper was so\r\ngreat that the issue of the Morning Herald, then but a recent venture, had\r\nto be suspended for a day or two.\r\n\r\nThe firm, which, when Mr. Fairbanks became connected with it, was Harris,\r\nFairbanks & Co., is now Fairbanks, Benedict & Co., Mr. Fairbanks being the\r\nonly member of the original firm yet connected with the concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. W. Gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. W. Gray was born in the village of Bradport, Addison county, Vermont,\r\non the 5th of August, 1813. When only two years of age his parents removed\r\nto Madrid, St. Lawrence county, New York, where his early life was passed,\r\nreceiving such meagre education as those early days afforded, during the\r\nWinter months, to farmer lads. He afterwards became a pupil in the\r\nInstitutes at Potsdam and Governeur, founded by the New York State\r\nAssociation for Teachers, where he made rapid progress, his mind,\r\nnaturally fond of study grasping knowledge intuitively. His scholastic\r\ncareer terminated here, the pecuniary means being wanting to enable him to\r\nprosecute a collegiate course, and he was soon after launched upon the\r\nworld to carve, with nothing but his own right arm and resolute will, the\r\nfuture high public and social position he subsequently attained.\r\n\r\nIn 1836, he came to Cleveland, then, though recently incorporated as a\r\ncity, in reality but a flourishing village, and was soon engaged as a\r\nteacher in one of the public schools, the old Academy, on St. Clair\r\nstreet, being the scene of his first labors. He continued here but two or\r\nthree terms, when a more advantageous position was offered him as\r\ninstructor of a district school in Geauga county, to which he repaired and\r\nwhere he continued about a year. On his return to the city, having fitted\r\nhimself in part previously, he entered the null of Hon. H. B. Payne and\r\nU. S. Judge Willson, who were then associated under the law firm of Payne &\r\nWillson, and after a little over a year under their preceptorship, during\r\nwhich time his remarkable talents attracted the attention of many, he was\r\nadmitted to the bar, and almost immediately after receiving his diploma\r\ncommenced the practice of his profession. He soon formed a law connection\r\nwhich led him to the State of Michigan, where, however he remained but a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nOn January 1st, 1842, in connection with his brother, A. N. Gray, he\r\npurchased the Cleveland Advertiser, which he converted into the Cleveland\r\nPlain Dealer.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1845, the firm of A. N. & J. W. Gray was dissolved, the latter\r\nbecoming sole proprietor and editor. The bold, poignant and dashing\r\ntalents he brought to bear, soon made the Plain Dealer widely known as a\r\npolitical journal and placed its editor among the foremost men of his\r\nparty in the State. In 1853, he received the appointment of post master of\r\nCleveland from President Pierce, which position he continued to hold till\r\nthe Summer of 1858, when, owing to his refusal to advocate the infamous\r\nLecompton constitution of Mr. Buchanan, he was beheaded with the scores of\r\nother martyrs who remained true to Senator Douglas and the constitutional\r\nrights and liberties of the people.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, he received the Democratic nomination for Congress against Hon.\r\nB. F. Wade, his successful competitor. In 1860, he was chosen, with Hon.\r\nH. B. Payne, delegate from this district to the Charleston-Baltimore\r\nconvention where he labored with untiring devotion for the nomination of\r\nJudge Douglas. When the revolt was raised by the traitorous South, he\r\nrallied at once to the support of the constitution and Union, and,\r\nfollowing the example of Douglas buried the partizan in the noble struggle\r\nof the patriot for the preservation of the liberties of the country.\r\n\r\nOf the Silas Wright school of politics, he labored during his editorial\r\ncareer of over twenty years, for his cherished principles. The friend of\r\nMr. Pierce, he was the beloved and confidential exponent of the great\r\nDouglas. No man possessed the friendship and esteem of the Illinois\r\nstatesman in a larger degree than did Mr. Gray. The Plain Dealer was Mr.\r\nDouglas' recognized organ--more so than any other paper published in the\r\ncountry, and the close intimacy which existed between them was never\r\ninterrupted, and continued to the hour of that statesman's death.\r\n\r\nMr. Gray died May 26, 1862. He had been feeble for a few days previously,\r\nand for a day or two before his death had not left the house, yet nothing\r\nserious was apprehended by his family or physicians, and though the nature\r\nof his illness was such as to have long made him an invalid, the hope was\r\nfirmly entertained that he would regain his general health. On the morning\r\nof the day of his death, however, paralysis seized his heart and lungs,\r\nsoon depriving him of speech, and under which he rapidly, but gently, sank\r\naway and died at fifteen minutes past two of the same day.\r\n\r\nHis life affords another example to the rising young men of the day, of\r\nthe power of will to triumph over all obstacles, when to indefatigable\r\nindustry are added those exemplary virtues, strict integrity and\r\ntemperance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge A. Benedict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge A. Benedict, of the printing and publishing firm of Fairbanks,\r\nBenedict & Co., and editor-in-chief of the Cleveland Herald, is a native\r\nof Jefferson county, New York, having been born in Watertown, August 5,\r\n1813. Mr. Benedict was well educated and in due course entered Yale\r\nCollege, from which he has received the degree of A. B.\r\n\r\nWhen eighteen years old he commenced the study of law with Judge Robert\r\nLansing, in Watertown, finishing his legal education in the office of\r\nSterling & Bronson. He was admitted to practice in New York, and\r\nimmediately thereafter, in 1835, removed to Ohio, taking up his residence\r\nin Cleveland. Here he entered the office of Andrews & Foot and\r\nsubsequently of that of John W. Allen, being admitted to practice in the\r\nOhio Courts in the year 1836.\r\n\r\nAs soon as admitted to the Ohio Bar a partnership was formed with John\r\nErwin, under the name of Erwin & Benedict; this arrangement continued\r\nthree years. On its dissolution Mr. Benedict formed a partnership with\r\nJames K. Hitchcock, the firm of Benedict & Hitchcock continuing until\r\n1848, when Mr. Benedict was appointed Clerk of the Superior Court, Judge\r\nAndrews being the Judge. With the adoption of the new constitution of the\r\nState this court became extinct.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the termination of his duties as Clerk of the Superior\r\nCourt, Mr. Benedict purchased an interest in the Herald establishment,\r\nand became co-partner with Messrs. J. A. Harris and A. W. Fairbanks. The\r\nsubsequent retirement of Mr. Harris from editorial life left Mr.\r\nBenedict as editor-in-chief of that paper, a position he has from that\r\ntime retained.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, Mr. Benedict was a member of the City Council, and president\r\nof that body. For one term previous to that time Mr. Benedict was\r\ncity attorney.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1865, Postmaster General Dennison, of Ohio, tendered to Mr.\r\nBenedict the office of Postmaster of Cleveland. The appointment was\r\naccepted, and at this writing, 1869, he still holds the office.\r\n\r\nMr. Benedict is impulsive in temperament, but his impulses are more of a\r\nfriendly than unkindly character. He is warm-hearted, quick to forgive a\r\nwrong atoned for, and still quicker to apologize for and atone an injury\r\ndone to others. In nearly a score of years editing a newspaper he has\r\nnever intentionally done injustice to any man, no matter what\r\ndifferences of opinion might exist, and has never knowingly allowed the\r\ncolumns of his newspaper to be the vehicle of private spite. Nor has he\r\never refused any one, fancying himself aggrieved, the privilege of\r\nsetting himself right in a proper manner in the same columns in which\r\nthe alleged injury was inflicted. He has the genuine and unforced\r\nrespect and esteem of those employed by him, for his treatment of them\r\nhas always been kind and considerate, and although no newspaper\r\nconductor can possibly avoid creating prejudice and temporary\r\nill-feeling. Mr. Benedict has probably no real enemy, whilst among those\r\nwho best know him he has none but warm friends.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his editorial abilities, Mr. Benedict is one of the few\r\nreally good writers of an occasional newspaper letter, and in his\r\njourneyings from home his letters to the Herald are looked for with\r\ninterest and read with keen relish.\r\n\r\nMr. Benedict was married June, 1839, to Miss Sarah R. Rathbone, of\r\nBrownsville, Jefferson county, New York, and has three children, the\r\noldest, George S. Benedict, being one of the proprietors and in the active\r\nbusiness management of the Herald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yours Truly, J. H. A. Bone]\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. H. A. Bone\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn H. A. Bone is a native of Cornwall, England, having been born in\r\nthat county October 31, 1830. He received a good education, being first\r\nintended for the army, but an accident having permanently crippled his\r\nright arm, that purpose had to be abandoned. He resided awhile in London\r\nand Liverpool, during which time he was connected with the press of\r\nthose cities, and contributed to periodicals. Having married in his\r\nnative place, he left England in the Autumn of 1851, for the United\r\nStates, and after a brief stay in New York, arrived in Cleveland in\r\nOctober of that year.\r\n\r\nEarly in the Spring of 1857, he joined the editorial staff of the\r\nCleveland Herald, to the columns of which he had for some years previous\r\nbeen a frequent contributor. At the same time he had contributed to the\r\npages of the Knickerbocker Magazine, Godey, Peterson's, the Boston Carpet\r\nBag, then conducted by B. P. Shillaber (\"Mrs. Partington,\") and G. C.\r\nHalpine (\"Miles O'Reilly,\") and other literary papers of Boston, New York\r\nand Philadelphia, as well as to a Cleveland magazine, the New American\r\nMonthly, and was a regular contributor to the Cincinnati Pen and Pencil, a\r\nhandsome weekly magazine of more than ordinary merit that was run for some\r\ntime under the editorship of W. W. Warden.\r\n\r\nMr. Bone, on joining the Herald, took charge of its commercial, local,\r\namusements and literary departments. As the business of the paper\r\nincreased he resigned those departments, one after another, to others, and\r\non the retirement of Mr. Harris, transferred his labors to the leading\r\neditorial department, retaining charge of the literary department also.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his daily duties on the Herald, Mr. Bone has found time to\r\nfurnish papers to the Atlantic Monthly on matters of scholarly interest\r\nand historical importance, has for the past three years been on the\r\nregular staff of Our Young Folks, contributing to it a number of\r\nhistorical articles, prepared with much care and research, and is an\r\noccasional contributor to other periodicals.\r\n\r\nMr. Bone published, about sixteen years ago, a small volume of poems,\r\nmostly written in boyhood. His after verses, of various characters, are\r\nscattered through newspapers and magazines and have never been collected.\r\nWith the exception of a few political squibs, he has for some years\r\nabandoned verse. A work on the oil regions was issued in 1864, and a\r\nsecond, enlarged edition, was published in Philadelphia, in 1865.\r\n\r\nAside from his professional duties as a journalist and the fulfilment of\r\nhis engagements as a magazine writer, Mr. Bone's literary tastes are\r\nchiefly with the older works of English literature. He is a close student\r\nof what is known as Early English, delighting in his intervals of leisure\r\nto pick from the quaint and curious relics of the earliest English\r\nliterature bits of evidence that serve to throw some light on the actual\r\nsocial and intellectual condition of our English ancestors four or five\r\ncenturies ago. He has been for years, and still is, connected with English\r\nliterary societies for the bringing to light and publishing for the use of\r\nthe members, unpublished documents of historical and literary value. Of\r\nwhat is know as Elizabethean literature he has been a diligent student. At\r\npresent he is connected with the management of the Cleveland Library\r\nAssociation and Western Reserve Historical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam W. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam W. Armstrong, one of the present proprietors of the Cleveland\r\nPlain Dealer, is a native Buckeye, having been born in New Lisbon,\r\nColumbiana county, Ohio, in 1833. In his fifteenth year he removed to\r\nTiffin, Seneca county, with the purpose of learning the printing business.\r\nIn 1852-3, he was appointed to the position of Registrar of the Bank\r\nDepartment in the State Treasurer's office at Columbus. In 1854, he\r\nreturned to Tiffin and purchased the Seneca County Advertiser, which he\r\nmade noticeable among the Democratic papers of the State for its vigor and\r\nability. He was recognized among the Democrats of the State as one of\r\ntheir rising men, and in 1862, he was chosen as the Democratic candidate\r\nfor Secretary of State, and was elected.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, having completed his term of office and returned to editorial\r\nlife, he purchased the material and good will of the Plain Dealer, which\r\nhad suspended publication, and set about bringing it back to its old\r\nprosperity and position among the journals of the State. His efforts were\r\ncrowned with success. The reputation of the paper for boldness and\r\nability, which had been affected by the death of its founder, was\r\nrestored, and the business knowledge and tact which Mr. Armstrong brought\r\nto bear upon its management before long put its affairs in a healthy state\r\nand established the journal on a good paying basis. Although a strong\r\npartisan in politics, Mr. Armstrong recognizes the importance of fairness\r\nand courtesy, and hence he has the personal good will of his professional\r\nand business rivals as well as associates.\r\n\r\nIn 1868, Mr. Armstrong was elected delegate at large to the Democratic\r\nNational Convention which nominated Horatio Seymour for the Presidency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrederick W. Green, the associate of Mr. Armstrong in the proprietorship\r\nand editorship of the Plain Dealer, was born in Fredericktown, Frederick\r\ncounty, Maryland, in 1816. In 1833, he removed to Tiffin, Seneca county,\r\nOhio. Becoming identified with the Democratic party he was elected by that\r\nparty Auditor of Seneca county, and retained that position six years. In\r\n1851, he was elected to Congress from the Seneca district, and in 1853,\r\nwas re-elected. At the close of his term he was appointed Clerk of the\r\nnewly organized United States District Court for the Northern District of\r\nOhio. In this position he remained twelve years.\r\n\r\nIn 1867, he purchased an interest in the Plain Dealer, and at once entered\r\nupon editorial duties on that paper in connection with Mr. Armstrong.\r\nTheir joint labors have made the paper the Democratic organ of Northern\r\nOhio. Mr. Green, during his fourteen years residence in Cleveland, has\r\nbeen reckoned among its most respectable citizens, and possesses many warm\r\nfriends irrespective of political differences of opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical and Statistical.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory of Cleveland\r\nTrade and Commerce\r\nShip Building\r\nThe Bench and Bar\r\nEducational\r\nRailroading\r\nThe Coal Interest\r\nReligious\r\nMedical\r\nManufacturing\r\nTelegraphy\r\nCity Improvements\r\nMilitary\r\nJournalism\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiographical Sketches.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose marked with an asterisk (*) are illustrated with portraits.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Aiken, S.
