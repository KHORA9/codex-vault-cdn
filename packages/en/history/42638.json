If specially designed to meet the\r\nrequirements of seamen it is called a chart, if on an exceptionally\r\nlarge scale a plan. The words map and chart are derived from _mappa_ and\r\n_charta_, the former being the Latin for napkin or cloth, the latter for\r\npapyrus or parchment. Maps were thus named after the material upon which\r\nthey were drawn or painted, and it should be noted that even at present\r\nmaps intended for use in the open air, by cyclists, military men and\r\nothers, are frequently printed on cloth. In Italian, Spanish and\r\nPortuguese the word _mappa_ has retained its place, by the side of\r\n_carta_, for marine charts, but in other languages both kinds of maps[1]\r\nare generally known by a word derived from the Latin _charta_, as\r\n_carte_ in French, _Karte_ in German, _Kaart_ in Dutch. A chart, in\r\nFrench, is called _carte hydrographique, marine or des côtes_; in\r\nSpanish or Portuguese _carta de marear_, in Italian _carta da navigare_,\r\nin German _Seekarte_ (to distinguish it from _Landkarte_), in Dutch\r\n_Zeekaart_ or _Paskaart_. A chart on Mercator's projection is called\r\n_Wassende graadkaart_ in Dutch, _carte réduite_ in French. Lastly, a\r\ncollection of maps is called an atlas, after the figure of Atlas, the\r\nTitan, supporting the heavens, which ornamented the title of Lafreri's\r\nand Mercator's atlases in the 16th century.\r\n\r\n_Classification of Maps._--Maps differ greatly, not only as to the scale\r\non which they are drawn, but also with respect to the fullness or the\r\ncharacter of the information which they convey. Broadly speaking, they\r\nmay be divided into two classes, of which the first includes\r\ntopographical, chorographical and general maps, the second the great\r\nvariety designed for special purposes.\r\n\r\nTopographical maps and plans are drawn on a scale sufficiently large to\r\nenable the draughtsman to show most objects on a scale true to\r\nnature.[2] Its information should not only be accurate, but also\r\nconveyed intelligibly and with taste. Exaggeration, however, is not\r\nalways to be avoided, for even on the British 1 in. ordnance map the\r\nroads appear as if they were 130 ft. in width.\r\n\r\nChorographical (Gr. [Greek: chôra], country or region) and general maps\r\nare either reduced from topographical maps or compiled from such\r\nmiscellaneous sources as are available. In the former case the\r\ncartographer is merely called upon to reduce and generalize the\r\ninformation given by his originals, to make a judicious selection of\r\nplace names, and to take care that the map is not overcrowded with names\r\nand details. Far more difficult is his task where no surveys are\r\navailable, and the map has to be compiled from a variety of sources.\r\nThese materials generally include reconnaissance survey of small\r\ndistricts, route surveys and astronomical observations supplied by\r\ntravellers, and information obtained from native sources. The compiler,\r\nin combining these materials, is called upon to examine the various\r\nsources of information, and to form an estimate of their value, which he\r\ncan only do if he have himself some knowledge of surveying and of the\r\nmethods of determining positions by astronomical observation. A\r\nknowledge of the languages in which the accounts of travellers are\r\nwritten, and even of native languages, is almost indispensable. He ought\r\nnot to be satisfied with compiling his map from existing maps, but\r\nshould subject each explorer's account to an independent examination,\r\nwhen he will frequently find that either the explorer himself, or the\r\ndraughtsman employed by him, has failed to introduce into his map the\r\nwhole of the information available. Latitudes from the observations of\r\ntravellers may generally be trusted, but longitudes should be accepted\r\nwith caution; for so competent an observer as Captain Speke placed the\r\ncapital of Uganda in longitude 32° 44´ E., when its true longitude as\r\ndetermined by more trustworthy observations is 32° 26´ E., an error of\r\n18´. Again, on the map illustrating Livingstone's \"Last Journals\" the\r\nLuapula is shown as issuing from the Bangweulu in the north-west, when\r\nan examination of the account of the natives who carried the great\r\nexplorer's remains to the coast would have shown that it leaves that\r\nlake on the south.\r\n\r\nThe second group includes all maps compiled for special purposes. Their\r\nvariety is considerable, for they are designed to illustrate physical\r\nand political geography, travel and navigation, trade and commerce, and,\r\nin fact, every subject connected with geographical distribution and\r\ncapable of being illustrated by means of a map. We thus have (1)\r\nphysical maps in great variety, including geological, orographical and\r\nhydrographical maps, maps illustrative of the geographical distribution\r\nof meteorological phenomena, of plants and animals, such as are to be\r\nfound in Berghaus's \"Physical Atlas,\" of which an enlarged English\r\nedition is published by J. G. Bartholomew of Edinburgh; (2) political\r\nmaps, showing political boundaries; (3) ethnological maps, illustrating\r\nthe distribution of the varieties of man, the density of population,\r\n&c.; (4) travel maps, showing roads or railways and ocean-routes (as is\r\ndone by Philips' \"Marine Atlas\"), or designed for the special use of\r\ncyclists or aviators; (5) statistical maps, illustrating commerce and\r\nindustries; (6) historical maps; (7) maps specially designed for\r\neducational purposes.\r\n\r\n_Scale of Maps._--Formerly map makers contented themselves with placing\r\nupon their maps a linear scale of miles, deduced from the central\r\nmeridian or the equator. They now add the proportion which these units\r\nof length have to nature, or state how many of these units are contained\r\nwithin some local measure of length. The former method, usually called\r\nthe \"natural scale,\" may be described as \"international,\" for it is\r\nquite independent of local measures of length, and depends exclusively\r\nupon the size and figure of the earth. Thus a scale of 1:1,000,000\r\nsignifies that each unit of length on the map represents one million of\r\nsuch units in nature. The second method is still employed in many cases,\r\nand we find thus:--\r\n\r\n  1 in. = 1 statute mile (of 63,366 in.) corresponds to 1 :  63,366\r\n  6 in. = 1    \"      \"         \"              \"        1 :  10,560\r\n  1 in. = 5 chains (of 858 in.)                \"        1 :   4,890\r\n  1 in. = 1 nautical mile (of 73,037 in.)      \"        1 :  73,037\r\n  1 in. = 1 verst (of 42,000 in.)              \"        1 :  42,000\r\n  2 Vienna in. = 1 Austrian mile (of\r\n      288,000 in.)                             \"        1 : 144,000\r\n  1 cm. = 500 metres (of 100 cm.)              \"        1 :  50,000\r\n\r\nIn cases where the draughtsman has omitted to indicate the scale we can\r\nascertain it by dividing the actual length of a meridian degree by the\r\nlength of a degree measure upon the map. Thus a degree between 50° and\r\n51° measures 111,226,000 mm.; on the map it is represented by 111 mm.\r\nHence the scale is 1:1,000,000 approximately.\r\n\r\nThe linear scale of maps can obviously be used only in the case of maps\r\ncovering a small area, for in the case of maps of greater extension\r\nmeasurements would be vitiated owing to the distortion or exaggeration\r\ninherent in all projections, not to mention the expansion or shrinking\r\nof the paper in the process of printing. As an extreme instance of the\r\nmisleading character of the scale given on maps embracing a wide area we\r\nmay refer to a map of a hemisphere. The scale of that map, as determined\r\nby the equator or centre meridian, we will suppose to be 1:125,000,000,\r\nwhile the encircling meridian indicates a scale of 1:80,000,000; and a\r\n\"mean\" scale, equal to the square root of the proportion which the area\r\nof the map bears to the actual area of a hemisphere, is 1:112,000,000.\r\nIn adopting a scale for their maps, cartographers will do well to choose\r\na multiple of 1000 if possible, for such a scale can claim to be\r\ninternational, while in planning an atlas they ought to avoid a needless\r\nmultiplicity of scales.\r\n\r\n_Map Projections_ are dealt with separately below. It will suffice\r\ntherefore to point out that the ordinary needs of the cartographer can\r\nbe met by conical projections, and, in the case of maps covering a wide\r\narea, by Lambert's equal area projection. The indiscriminate use of\r\nMercator's projection, for maps of the world, is to be deprecated owing\r\nto the inordinate exaggeration of areas in high latitudes. In the case\r\nof topographical maps sheets bounded by meridians and parallels are to\r\nbe commended.\r\n\r\nThe meridian of Greenwich has been universally accepted as the initial\r\nmeridian, but in the case of most topographical maps of foreign\r\ncountries local meridians are still adhered to--the more important among\r\nwhich are:--\r\n\r\n  Paris (Obs. nationale)      2° 20´ 14´´ E. of Greenwich.\r\n  Pulkova (St Petersburg)    30° 19´ 39´´ E.        \"\r\n  Stockholm                  18°  3´ 30´´ E.        \"\r\n  Rome (Collegio Romano)     12° 28´ 40´´ E.        \"\r\n  Brussels (Old town)         4° 22´ 11´´ E.        \"\r\n  Madrid                      3° 41´ 16´´ W.        \"\r\n  Ferro (assumed)            20°  0´  0´´ W. of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe _outline_ includes coast-line, rivers, roads, towns, and in fact all\r\nobjects capable of being shown on a map, with the exception of the hills\r\nand of woods, swamps, deserts and the like, which the draughtsman\r\ngenerally describes as \"ornament.\" Conventional signs and symbols are\r\nuniversally used in depicting these objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n_Delineation of the Ground._--The mole-hills and serrated ridges of\r\nmedieval maps were still in almost general use at the close of the 18th\r\ncentury, and are occasionally met with at the present day, being cheaply\r\nproduced, readily understood by the unlearned, and in reality preferable\r\nto the uncouth and misleading hatchings still to be seen on many maps.\r\nFar superior are those scenographic representations which enable a\r\nperson consulting the map to identify prominent landmarks, such as the\r\nPic du Midi, which rises like a pillar to the south of Pau, but is not\r\nreadily discovered upon an ordinary map. This advantage is still fully\r\nrecognized, for such views of distant hills are still commonly given on\r\nthe margin of marine charts for the assistance of navigators; military\r\nsurveyors are encouraged to introduce sketches of prominent landmarks\r\nupon their reconnaissance plans, and the general public is enabled to\r\nconsult \"Picturesque Relief Maps\"--such as F. W. Delkeskamp's\r\n_Switzerland_ (1830) or his _Panorama of the Rhine_. Delineations such\r\nas these do not, however, satisfy scientific requirements. All objects\r\non a map are required to be shown as projected horizontally upon a\r\nplane. This principle must naturally be adhered to when delineating the\r\nfeatures of the ground. This was recognized by J. Picard and other\r\nmembers of the Academy of Science whom Colbert, in 1668, directed to\r\nprepare a new map of France, for on David Vivier's map of the environs\r\nof Paris (1674, scale 1:86,400) very crude hachures bounding the rivers\r\nhave been substituted for the scenographic hills of older maps. Little\r\nprogress in the delineation of the ground, however, was made until\r\ntowards the close of the 18th century, when horizontal contours and\r\nhachures regulated according to the angle of inclination of all slopes,\r\nwere adopted. These contours intersect the ground at a given distance\r\nabove or below the level of the sea, and thus bound a series of\r\nhorizontal planes (see fig. 1). Contours of this kind were first\r\nutilized by M. S. Cruquius in his chart of the Merwede (1728); Philip\r\nBuache (1737) introduced such contours or isobaths (Gr. [Greek: isos],\r\nequal; [Greek: bathys], deep) upon his chart of the Channel, and\r\nintended to introduce similar contours or isohypses ([Greek: hypsos],\r\nheight) for a representation of the land. Dupain-Triel, acting upon a\r\nsuggestion of his friend M. Ducarla, published his _La France considérée\r\ndans les différentes hauteurs de ses plaines_ (1791), upon which\r\nequidistant contours at intervals of 16 toises found a place. The\r\nscientific value of these contoured maps is fully recognized. They not\r\nonly indicate the height of the land, but also enable us to compute the\r\ndeclivity of the mountain slopes; and if minor features of ground lying\r\nbetween two contours--such as ravines, as also rocky precipices and\r\nglaciers--are indicated, as is done on the Siegfried atlas of\r\nSwitzerland, they fully meet the requirements of the scientific man, the\r\nengineer and the mountain-climber. At the same time it cannot be denied\r\nthat these maps, unless the contours are inserted at short intervals,\r\nlack graphic expression. Two methods are employed to attain this: the\r\nfirst distinguishes the strata or layers by colours; the second\r\nindicates the varying slopes by shades or hachures. The first of these\r\nmethods yields a hypsographical, or--if the sea-bottom be included, in\r\nwhich case all contours are referred to a common datum line--a bathy\r\nhypsographical map. Carl Ritter, in 1806, employed graduated tints,\r\nincreasing in lightness on proceeding from the lowlands to the\r\nhighlands; while General F. von Hauslab, director of the Austrian\r\nSurveys, in 1842, advised that the darkest tints should be allotted to\r\nthe highlands, so that they might not obscure details in the densely\r\npeopled plains. The desired effect may be produced by a graduation of\r\nthe same colour, or by a polychromatic scale--such as white, pale red,\r\npale brown, various shades of green, violet and purple, in ascending\r\norder. C. von Sonklar, in his map of the Hohe Tauern (1:144,000; 1864)\r\ncoloured plains and valleys green; mountain slopes in five shades of\r\nbrown; glaciers blue or white. E. G. Ravenstein's map of Ben Nevis\r\n(1887) first employed the colours of the spectrum, viz. green to brown,\r\nin ascending order for the land; blue, indigo and violet for the sea,\r\nincreasing in intensity with the height or the depth. At first\r\ncartographers chose their colours rather arbitrarily. Thus Horsell, who\r\nwas the first to introduce tints on his map of Sweden and Norway\r\n(1:600,000; 1835), coloured the lowlands up to 300 ft. in green,\r\nsucceeded by red, yellow and white for the higher ground; while A.\r\nPapen, on his hypsographical map of Central Europe (1857) introduced a\r\nperplexing range of colours. At the present time compilers of strata\r\nmaps generally limit themselves to two or three colours, in various\r\nshades, with green for the lowlands, brown for the hills and blue for\r\nthe sea. On the international map of the world, planned by Professor A.\r\nPenck on a scale of 1:1,000,000, which has been undertaken by the\r\nleading governments of the world, the ground is shown by contours at\r\nintervals of 100 metres (to be increased to 200 and 500 metres in\r\nmountainous districts); the strata are in graded tints, viz. blue for\r\nthe sea, green for lowlands up to 300 metres, yellow between 300 and 500\r\nmetres, brown up to 2000 metres, and reddish tints beyond that height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe declivities of the ground are still indicated in most topographical\r\nmaps by a system of strokes or hachures, first devised by L. Chr. Müller\r\n(_Plan und Kartenzeichnen_, 1788) and J. G. Lehmann, who directed a\r\nsurvey of Saxony, 1780-1806, and published his _Theorie der\r\nBergzeichnung_ in 1799. By this method the slopes are indicated by\r\nstrokes or hachures crossing the contour lines at right angles, in the\r\ndirection of flowing water, and varying in thickness according to the\r\ndegree of declivity they represent (cf. for example, the map of\r\nSWITZERLAND in this work). The light is supposed to descend vertically\r\nupon the country represented, and in a true scale of shade the intensity\r\nincreases with the inclination from 0° to 90°; but as such a scale does\r\nnot sufficiently differentiate the lesser inclinations which are the\r\nmost important, the author adopted a conventional scale, representing a\r\nslope of 45° or more, supposed to be inaccessible, as absolutely black,\r\nthe level surfaces, which reflect all the light which falls upon them,\r\nas perfectly white, and the intervening slopes by a proportion between\r\nblack and white, as in fig. 2. The main principles of this system have\r\nbeen maintained, but its details have been modified frequently to suit\r\nspecial cases. Thus the French survey commission of 1828 fixed the\r\nproportion of black to white at one and a half times the angle of slope;\r\nwhile in Austria, where steep mountains constitute an important feature,\r\nsolid black has been reserved for a slope of 80°, the proportion of\r\nblack to white varying from 80:0 (for 50°) to 8:72 (for 5°). On the map\r\nof Germany (1:100,000) a slope of 50° is shown in solid black while\r\nstippled hachures are used for gentle slopes up to 10°. Instead of\r\nshading lines following the greatest slopes, lines following the\r\ncontours and varying in their thickness and in their intervals apart,\r\naccording to the slope of the ground to be represented, may be\r\nemployed. This method affords a ready and expeditious means of sketching\r\nthe ground, if the draughtsman limits himself to characteristically\r\nindicating its features by what have been called \"form lines.\" This\r\nmethod can be recommended in the case of plotting the results of an\r\nexplorer's route, or in the case of countries of which we have no\r\nregular survey (cf. the map of AFGHANISTAN in this work).\r\n\r\nInstead of supposing the light to fall vertically upon the surface it is\r\noften supposed to fall obliquely, generally at an angle of 45° from the\r\nupper left-hand corner. It is claimed for this method that it affords a\r\nmeans of giving a graphic representation of Alpine districts where other\r\nmethods of shading fail. The Dufour map of Switzerland (1:100,000) is\r\none of the finest examples of this style of hill-shading. For use in the\r\nfield, however, and for scientific work, a contoured map like\r\nSiegfried's atlas of Switzerland, or, in the case of hilly country, a\r\nmap shaded on the assumption of a vertical light, will prove more useful\r\nthan one of these, notwithstanding that truth to nature and artistic\r\nbeauty are claimed on their behalf.\r\n\r\nInstead of shading by lines, a like effect may be produced by mezzotint\r\nshading (cf. the map of ITALY, or other maps, in this work, on a similar\r\nmethod), and if this be combined with contour lines very satisfactory\r\nresults can be achieved. If this tint be printed in grey or brown,\r\nisohypses, in black or red, show distinctly above it. The same\r\ncombination is possible if hills engraved in the ordinary manner are\r\nprinted in colours, as is done in an edition of the 1-inch ordnance map,\r\nwith contours in red and hills hachured in brown.\r\n\r\nEfforts have been made of late years to improve the available methods of\r\nrepresenting ground, especially in Switzerland, but the so-called\r\nstereoscopic or relief maps produced by F. Becker, X. Imfeld, Kümmerly,\r\nF. Leuzinger and other able cartographers, however admirable as works of\r\nart, do not, from the point of utility, supersede the combination of\r\nhorizontal contours with shaded slopes, such as have been long in use.\r\nThere seems to be even less chance for the combination of coloured\r\nstrata and hachures proposed by K. Peucker, whose theoretical\r\ndisquisitions on aerial perspective are of interest, but have not\r\nhitherto led to satisfactory practical results.[3]\r\n\r\nThe above remarks apply more particularly to topographic maps. In the\r\ncase of general maps on a smaller scale, the orographic features must be\r\ngeneralized by a skilful draughtsman and artist. One of the best modern\r\nexamples of this kind is Vogel's map of Germany, on a scale of\r\n1:500,000.\r\n\r\n_Selection of Names and Orthography._--The nomenclature or \"lettering\"\r\nof maps is a subject deserving special attention. Not only should the\r\nnames be carefully selected with special reference to the objects which\r\nthe map is intended to serve, and to prevent overcrowding by the\r\nintroduction of names which can serve no useful object, but they should\r\nalso be arranged in such a manner as to be read easily by a person\r\nconsulting the map. It is an accepted rule now that the spelling of\r\nnames in countries using the Roman alphabet should be retained, with\r\nsuch exceptions as have been familiarized by long usage. In such cases,\r\nhowever, the correct native form should be added within brackets, as\r\nFlorence (Firenze), Leghorn (Livorno), Cologne (Cöln) and so on. At the\r\nsame time these corrupted forms should be eliminated as far as possible.\r\nNames in languages not using the Roman alphabet, or having no written\r\nalphabet should be spelt phonetically, as pronounced on the spot. An\r\nelaborate universal alphabet, abounding in diacritical marks, has been\r\ndevised for the purpose by Professor Lepsius, and various other systems\r\nhave been adopted for Oriental languages, and by certain missionary\r\nsocieties, adapted to the languages in which they teach. The following\r\nsimple rules, laid down by a Committee of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, will be found sufficient as a rule; according to this system\r\nthe vowels are to be sounded as in Italian, the consonants as in\r\nEnglish, and no redundant letters are to be introduced. The diphthong\r\n_ai_ is to be pronounced as in _aisle_; _au_ as _ow_ in _how_; _aw_ as\r\nin _law_. _Ch_ is always to be sounded as in _church_, _g_ is always\r\nhard; _y_ always represents a consonant; whilst _kh_ and _gh_ stand for\r\ngutturals. One accent only is to be used, the acute, to denote the\r\nsyllable on which stress is laid. This system has in great measure been\r\nfollowed throughout the present work, but it is obvious that in numerous\r\ninstances these rules must prove inadequate. The introduction of\r\nadditional diacritical marks, such as [macron mark] and [breve mark],\r\nused to express quantity, and the diaeresis, as in _aï_, to express\r\nconsecutive vowels, which are to be pronounced separately, may prove of\r\nservice, as also such letters as _ä_, _ö_ and _ü_, to be pronounced as\r\nin German, and in lieu of the French _ai_, _eu_ or _u_.\r\n\r\nThe United States Geographic Board acts upon rules practically identical\r\nwith those indicated, and compiles official lists of place-names, the\r\nuse of which is binding upon government departments, but which it would\r\nhardly be wise to follow universally in the case of names of places\r\noutside America.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT ON MAPS\r\n\r\n_Measurement of Distance._--The shortest distance between two places on\r\nthe surface of a globe is represented by the arc of a great circle. If\r\nthe two places are upon the same meridian or upon the equator the exact\r\ndistance separating them is to be found by reference to a table giving\r\nthe lengths of arcs of a meridian and of the equator. In all other cases\r\nrecourse must be had to a map, a globe or mathematical formula.\r\nMeasurements made on a topographical map yield the most satisfactory\r\nresults. Even a general map may be trusted, as long as we keep within\r\nten degrees of its centre. In the case of more considerable distances,\r\nhowever, a globe of suitable size should be consulted, or--and this\r\nseems preferable--they should be calculated by the rules of spherical\r\ntrigonometry. The problem then resolves itself in the solution of a\r\nspherical triangle.\r\n\r\n  In the formulae which follow we suppose l and l´ to represent the\r\n  latitudes, a and b the co-latitudes (90-l or 90° - l´), and t the\r\n  difference in longitude between them or the meridian distance, whilst\r\n  D is the distance required.\r\n\r\n  If both places have the same latitude we have to deal with an\r\n  isosceles triangle, of which two sides and the included angle are\r\n  given. This triangle, for the convenience of calculation, we divide\r\n  into two right-angled triangles. Then we have sin ½ D = sin a sin ½ t,\r\n  and since sin a = sin (90° - l) = cos t, it follows that\r\n\r\n    sin ½ D = cos l sin ½ t.\r\n\r\n  If the latitudes differ, we have to solve an oblique-angled spherical\r\n  triangle, of which two sides and the included angle are given. Thus,\r\n\r\n            cos D - cos a cos b\r\n    cos t = -------------------\r\n                sin a sin b\r\n\r\n    cos D = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos t\r\n\r\n          = sin l sin l´ + cos l cos l´ cos t.\r\n\r\n  In order to adapt this formula to logarithms, we introduce a\r\n  subsidiary angle p, such that cot p = cot l cos t; we then have\r\n\r\n    cos D = sin l cos(l´ - p) / sin p.\r\n\r\n  In the above formulae our earth is assumed to be a sphere, but when\r\n  calculating and reducing to the sea-level, a base-line, or the side of\r\n  a primary triangulation, account must be taken of the spheroidal shape\r\n  of the earth and of the elevation above the sea-level. The error due\r\n  to the neglect of the former would at most amount to 1%, while a\r\n  reduction to the mean level of the sea necessitates but a trifling\r\n  reduction, amounting, in the case of a base-line 100,000 metres in\r\n  length, measured on a plateau of 3700 metres (12,000 ft.) in height,\r\n  to 57 metres only.\r\n\r\n  These orthodromic distances are of course shorter than those measured\r\n  along a loxodromic line, which intersects all parallels at the same\r\n  angle. Thus the distance between New York and Oporto, following the\r\n  former (great circle sailing), amounts to 3000 m., while following the\r\n  rhumb, as in Mercator sailing, it would amount to 3120 m.\r\n\r\n  These direct distances may of course differ widely with the distance\r\n  which it is necessary to travel between two places along a road, down\r\n  a winding river or a sinuous coast-line. Thus, the direct distance, as\r\n  the crow flies, between Brig and the hospice of the Simplon amounts to\r\n  4.42 geogr. m. (slope nearly 9°), while the distance by road measures\r\n  13.85 geogr. m. (slope nearly 3°). Distances such as these can be\r\n  measured only on a topographical map of a fairly large scale, for on\r\n  general maps many of the details needed for that purpose can no longer\r\n  be represented. Space runners for facilitating these measurements,\r\n  variously known as chartometers, curvimeters, opisometers, &c., have\r\n  been devised in great variety. Nearly all these instruments register\r\n  the revolution of a small wheel of known circumference, which is run\r\n  along the line to be measured.\r\n\r\n  _The Measurement of Areas_ is easily effected if the map at our\r\n  disposal is drawn on an equal area projection. In that case we need\r\n  simply cover the map with a network of squares--the area of each of\r\n  which has been determined with reference to the scale of the\r\n  map--count the squares, and estimate the contents of those only\r\n  partially enclosed within the boundary, and the result will give the\r\n  area desired. Instead of drawing these squares upon the map itself,\r\n  they may be engraved or etched upon glass, or drawn upon transparent\r\n  celluloid or tracing-paper. Still more expeditious is the use of a\r\n  planimeter, such as Captain Prytz's \"Hatchet Planimeter,\" which yields\r\n  fairly accurate results, or G. Coradi's \"Polar Planimeter,\" one of the\r\n  most trustworthy instruments of the kind.[4]\r\n\r\n  When dealing with maps not drawn on an equal area projection we\r\n  substitute quadrilaterals bounded by meridians and parallels, the\r\n  areas for which are given in the \"Smithsonian Geographical Tables\"\r\n  (1894), in Professor H. Wagner's tables in the geographical\r\n  _Jahrbuch_, or similar works.\r\n\r\n  It is obvious that the area of a group of mountains projected on a\r\n  horizontal plane, such as is presented by a map, must differ widely\r\n  from the area of the superficies or physical surface of those\r\n  mountains exposed to the air. Thus, a slope of 45° having a surface of\r\n  100 sq. m. projected upon a horizontal plane only measures 59 sq. m.,\r\n  whilst 100 sq. m. of the snowclad Sentis in Appenzell are reduced to\r\n  10 sq. m. A hypsographical map affords the readiest solution of this\r\n  question. Given the area A of the plane between the two horizontal\r\n  contours, the height h of the upper above the lower contour, the\r\n  length of the upper contour l, and the area of the face presented by\r\n  the edge of the upper stratum t·h = A1, the slope [alpha] is found to\r\n  be tan [alpha] = h·l / (A - A1); hence its superficies, A = A2 sec\r\n  [alpha]. The result is an approximation, for inequalities of the\r\n  ground bounded by the two contours have not been considered.\r\n\r\n  The hypsographical map facilitates likewise the determination of the\r\n  _mean height_ of a country, and this height, combined with the area,\r\n  the determination of volume, or cubic contents, is a simple matter.[5]\r\n\r\n_Relief Maps_ are intended to present a representation of the ground\r\nwhich shall be absolutely true to nature. The object, however, can be\r\nfully attained only if the scale of the map is sufficiently large, if\r\nthe horizontal and vertical scales are identical, so that there shall be\r\nno exaggeration of the heights, and if regard is had, eventually, to the\r\ncurvature of the earth's surface. Relief maps on a small scale\r\nnecessitate a generalization of the features of the ground, as in the\r\ncase of ordinary maps, as likewise an exaggeration of the heights. Thus\r\non a relief on a scale of 1:1,000,000 a mountain like Ben Nevis would\r\nonly rise to a height of 1.3 mm.\r\n\r\nThe methods of producing reliefs vary according to the scale and the\r\nmaterials available. A simple plan is as follows--draw an outline of the\r\ncountry of which a map is to be produced upon a board; mark all points\r\nthe altitude of which is known or can be estimated by pins or wires\r\nclipped off so as to denote the heights; mark river-courses and suitable\r\nprofiles by strips of vellum and finally finish your model with the aid\r\nof a good map, in clay or wax. If contoured maps are available it is\r\neasy to build up a strata-relief, which facilitates the completion of\r\nthe relief so that it shall be a fair representation of nature, which\r\nthe strata-relief cannot claim to be. A pantograph armed with\r\ncutting-files[6] which carve the relief out of a block of gypsum, was\r\nemployed in 1893-1900 by C. Perron of Geneva, in producing his relief\r\nmap of Switzerland on a scale of 1:100,000. After copies of such reliefs\r\nhave been taken in gypsum, cement, statuary pasteboard, fossil dust\r\nmixed with vegetable oil, or some other suitable material, they are\r\npainted. If a number of copies is required it may be advisable to print\r\na map of the country represented in colours, and either to emboss this\r\nmap, backed with papier-mâché, or paste it upon a copy of the relief--a\r\ntask of some difficulty. Relief maps are frequently objected to on\r\naccount of their cost, bulk and weight, but their great use in teaching\r\ngeography is undeniable.\r\n\r\n_Globes._[7]--It is impossible to represent on a plane the whole of the\r\nearth's surface, or even a large extent of it, without a considerable\r\namount of distortion. On the other hand a map drawn on the surface of a\r\nsphere representing a terrestrial globe will prove true to nature, for\r\nit possesses, in combination, the qualities which the ingenuity of no\r\nmathematician has hitherto succeeded in imparting to a projection\r\nintended for a map of some extent, namely, equivalence of areas of\r\ndistances and angles. Nevertheless, it should be observed that our\r\nglobes take no account of the oblateness of our sphere; but as the\r\ndifference in length between the circumference of the equator and the\r\nperimeter of a meridian ellipse only amounts to 0.16%, it could be shown\r\nonly on a globe of unusual size.\r\n\r\nThe method of manufacturing a globe is much the same as it was at the\r\nbeginning of the 16th century. A matrix of wood or iron is covered with\r\nsuccessive layers of papers, pasted together so as to form pasteboard.\r\nThe shell thus formed is then cut along the line of the intended equator\r\ninto two hemispheres, they are then again glued together and made to\r\nrevolve round an axis the ends of which passed through the poles and\r\nentered a metal meridian circle. The sphere is then coated with plaster\r\nor whiting, and when it has been smoothed on a lathe and dried, the\r\nlines representing meridians and parallels are drawn upon it. Finally\r\nthe globe is covered with the paper gores upon which the map is drawn.\r\nThe adaption of these gores to the curvature of the sphere calls for\r\ngreat care. Generally from 12 to 24 gores and two small segments for the\r\npolar regions printed on vellum paper are used for each globe. The\r\nmethod of preparing these gores was originally found empirically, but\r\nsince the days of Albert Dürer it has also engaged the minds of many\r\nmathematicians, foremost among whom was Professor A. G. Kästner of\r\nGöttingen. One of the best instructions for the manufacture of globes we\r\nowe to Altmütter of Vienna.[8]\r\n\r\nLarger globes are usually on a stand the top of which supports an\r\nartificial horizon. The globe itself rotates within a metallic meridian\r\nto which its axis is attached. Other accessories are an hour-circle,\r\naround the north pole, a compass placed beneath the globe, and a\r\nflexible quadrant used for finding the distances between places. These\r\naccessories are indispensable if it be proposed to solve the problems\r\nusually propounded in books on the \"use of the globes,\" but can be\r\ndispensed with if the globe is to serve only as a map of the world. The\r\nsize of a globe is usually given in terms of its diameter. To find its\r\nscale divide the mean diameter of the earth (1,273,500 m.) by the\r\ndiameter of the globe; to find its circumference multiply the diameter\r\nby [pi] (3.1416).\r\n\r\n_Map Printing._--Maps were first printed in the second half of the 15th\r\ncentury. Those in the _Rudimentum novitiarum_ published at Lübeck in\r\n1475 are from woodcuts, while the maps in the first two editions of\r\nPtolemy published in Italy in 1472 are from copper plates. Wood\r\nengraving kept its ground for a considerable period, especially in\r\nGermany, but copper in the end supplanted it, and owing to the beauty\r\nand clearness of the maps produced by a combination of engraving and\r\netching it still maintains its ground. The objection that a copper plate\r\nshows signs of wear after a thousand impressions have been taken has\r\nbeen removed, since duplicate plates are readily produced by\r\nelectrotyping, while transfers of copper engravings, on stone, zinc or\r\naluminium, make it possible to turn out large editions in a\r\nprinting-machine, which thus supersedes the slow-working hand-press.[9]\r\nThese impressions from transfers, however, are liable to be inferior to\r\nimpressions taken from an original plate or an electrotype. The art of\r\nlithography greatly affected the production of maps. The work is either\r\nengraved upon the stone (which yields the most satisfactory result at\r\nhalf the cost of copper-engraving), or it is drawn upon the stone by\r\npen, brush or chalk (after the stone has been \"grained\"), or it is\r\ntransferred from a drawing upon transfer paper in lithographic ink. In\r\nchromolithography a stone is required for each colour. Owing to the\r\ngreat weight of stones, their cost and their liability of being\r\nfractured in the press, zinc plates, and more recently aluminium plates,\r\nhave largely taken the place of stone. The processes of zincography and\r\nof algraphy (aluminium printing) are essentially the same as\r\nlithography. Zincographs are generally used for producing surface blocks\r\nor plates which may be printed in the same way as a wood-cut. Another\r\nprocess of producing such blocks is known as cerography (Gr. [Greek:\r\nkêros]), wax. A copper plate having been coated with wax, outline and\r\nornament are cut into the wax, the lettering is impressed with type, and\r\nthe intaglio thus produced is electrotyped.[10] Movable types are\r\nutilized in several other ways in the production of maps. Thus the\r\nlettering of the map, having been set up in type, is inked in and\r\ntransferred to a stone or a zinc-plate, or it is impressed upon\r\ntransfer-paper and transferred to the stone. Photographic processes have\r\nbeen utilized not only in reducing maps to a smaller scale, but also for\r\nproducing stones and plates from which they may be printed. The\r\nmanuscript maps intended to be produced by photographic processes upon\r\nstone, zinc or aluminium, are drawn on a scale somewhat larger than the\r\nscale on which they are to be printed, thus eliminating all those\r\nimperfections which are inherent in a pen-drawing. The saving in time\r\nand cost by adopting this process is considerable, for a plan, the\r\nengraving of which takes two years, can now be produced in two days.\r\nAnother process, photo- or heliogravure, for obtaining an engraved image\r\non a copper plate, was for the first time employed on a large scale for\r\nproducing a new topographical map of the Austrian Empire in 718 sheets,\r\non a scale of 1 : 75,000, which was completed in seventeen years\r\n(1873-1890). The original drawings for this map had to be done with\r\nexceptional neatness, the draughtsman spending twelve months on that\r\nwhich he would have completed in four months had it been intended to\r\nengrave the map on copper; yet an average chart, measuring 530 by 630\r\nmm., which would have taken two years and nine months for drawing and\r\nengraving, was completed in less than fifteen months--fifty days of\r\nwhich were spent in \"retouching\" the copper plate. It only cost £169 as\r\ncompared with £360 had the old method been pursued.\r\n\r\n  For details of the various methods of reproduction see LITHOGRAPHY;\r\n  PROCESS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CARTOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nA capacity to understand the nature of maps is possessed even by peoples\r\nwhom we are in the habit of describing as \"savages.\" Wandering tribes\r\nnaturally enjoy a great advantage in this respect over sedentary ones.\r\nOur arctic voyagers--Sir E. W. Parry, Sir J. Ross, Sir F. L. MacClintock\r\nand others--have profited from rough maps drawn for them by Eskimos.\r\nSpecimens of such maps are given in C. F. Hall's _Life with the\r\nEsquimaux_ (London, 1864). Henry Youle Hind, in his work on the Labrador\r\nPeninsula (London, 1863) praises the map which the Montagnais and\r\nNasquapee Indians drew upon bark. Similar essays at map-making are\r\nreported in connexion with Australians, Maoris and Polynesians. Tupaya,\r\na Tahitian, who accompanied Captain Cook in the \"Endeavour\" to Europe,\r\nsupplied his patron with maps; Raraka drew a map in chalk of the Paumotu\r\narchipelago on the deck of Captain Wilkes's vessel; the Marshall\r\nislanders, according to Captain Winkler (_Marine Rundschau_, Oct. 1893)\r\npossess maps upon which the bearings of the islands are indicated by\r\nsmall strokes. Far superior were the maps found among the semi-civilized\r\nMexicans when the Spaniards first discovered and invaded their country.\r\nAmong them were cadastral plans of villages, maps of the provinces of\r\nthe empire of the Aztecs, of towns and of the coast. Montezuma presented\r\nCortes with a map, painted on Nequen cloth, of the Gulf coast. Another\r\nmap did the Conquistador good service on his campaign against Honduras\r\n(Lorenzana, _Historia de nueva España_, Mexico, 1770; W. H. Prescott,\r\n_History of the Conquest of Mexico_, New York, 1843). Peru, the empire\r\nof the Incas, had not only ordinary maps, but also maps in relief, for\r\nPedro Sarmiento da Gamboa (_History of the Incas_, translated by A. R.\r\nMarkham, 1907) tells us that the 9th Inca (who died in 1191) ordered\r\nsuch reliefs to be produced of certain localities in a district which he\r\nhad recently conquered and intended to colonize. These were the first\r\nrelief maps on record. It is possible that these primitive efforts of\r\nAmerican Indians might have been further developed, but the Spanish\r\nconquest put a stop to all progress, and for a consecutive history of\r\nthe map and map-making we must turn to the Old World, and trace this\r\nhistory from Egypt and Babylon, through Greece, to our own age.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians were famed as \"geometers,\" and as early as the\r\ndays of Rameses II. (Sesostris of the Greeks, 1333-1300 B.C.) there had\r\nbeen made a cadastral survey of the country showing the rows of pillars\r\nwhich separated the nomens as well as the boundaries of landed estates.\r\nIt was upon a map based upon such a source that Eratosthenes (276-196\r\nB.C.) measured the distance between Syene and Alexandria which he\r\nrequired for his determination of the length of a degree. Ptolemy, who\r\nhad access to the treasures of the famous library of Alexandria was\r\nable, no doubt, to utilize these cadastral plans when compiling his\r\n_geography_. It should be noted that he places Syene only two degrees to\r\nthe east of Alexandria instead of three degrees, the actual meridian\r\ndistance between the two places; a difference which would result from an\r\nerror of only 7° is the orientation of the map used by Ptolemy. Scarcely\r\nany specimens of ancient Egyptian cartography have survived. In the\r\nTurin Museum are preserved two papyri with rough drawings of gold mines\r\nestablished by Sesostris in the Nubian Desert.[11] These drawings have\r\nbeen commented upon by S. Birch, F. Chabas, R. J. Lauth and other\r\nEgyptologists, and have been referred to as the two most ancient maps in\r\nexistence. They can, however, hardly be described as maps, while in age\r\nthey are surpassed by several cartographical clay tablets discovered in\r\nBabylonia. On another papyrus in the same museum is depicted the\r\nvictorious return of Seti I. (1366-1333) from Syria, showing the road\r\nfrom Pelusium to Heroopolis, the canal from the Nile with crocodiles,\r\nand a lake (mod. Lake Timsah) with fish in it. Apollonius of Rhodes who\r\nsucceeded Eratosthenes as chief librarian at Alexandria (196 B.C.)\r\nreports in his _Argonautica_ (iv. 279) that the inhabitants of Colchis\r\nwhom, like Herodotus (ii., 104) he looks upon as the descendants of\r\nEgyptian colonists, preserved, as heirlooms, certain graven tablets\r\n([Greek: kurbeis]) on which land and sea, roads and towns were\r\naccurately indicated.[12] Eustathius (since 1160 archbishop of\r\nThessalonica) in his commentary on Dionysius Periegetes, mentions\r\nroute-maps which Sesostris caused to be prepared, while Strabo (i., 1.\r\n5) dwells at length upon the wealth of geographical documents to be\r\nfound in the library of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nA cadastral survey for purposes of taxation was already at work in\r\nBabylonia in the age of Sargon of Akkad, 3800 B.C. In the British Museum\r\nmay be seen a series of clay tablets, circular in shape and dating back\r\nto 2300 or 2100 B.C., which contain surveys of lands. One of these\r\ndepicts in a rough way lower Babylonia encircled by a \"salt water\r\nriver,\" Oceanus.\r\n\r\n_Development of Map-making among the Greeks._[13]--Ionian mercenaries\r\nand traders first arrived in Egypt, on the invitation of Psammetichus I.\r\nabout the middle of the 7th century B.C. Among the visitors to Egypt,\r\nthere were, no doubt, some who took an interest in the science of the\r\nEgyptians. One of the most distinguished among them was Thales of\r\nMiletus (640-543 B.C.), the founder of the Ionian school of philosophy,\r\nwhose pupil, Anaximander (611-546 B.C.) is credited by Eratosthenes with\r\nhaving designed the first map of the world. Anaximander looked upon the\r\nearth as a section of a cylinder, of considerable thickness, suspended\r\nin the centre of the circular vault of the heavens, an idea perhaps\r\nborrowed from the Babylonians, for Job (xxvi. 7) already speaks of the\r\nearth as \"hanging upon nothing.\" Like Homer he looked upon the habitable\r\nworld ([Greek: oikoumenê]) as being circular in outline and bounded by a\r\ncircumfluent river. The geographical knowledge of Anaximander was\r\nnaturally more ample than that of Homer, for it extended from the\r\nCassiterides or Tin Islands in the west to the Caspian in the east,\r\nwhich he conceived to open out into Oceanus. The Aegean Sea occupied the\r\ncentre of the map, while the line where ocean and firmament seemed to\r\nmeet represented an enlarged horizon.\r\n\r\nAnaximenes, a pupil of Anaximander, was the first to reject the view\r\nthat the earth was a circular plane, but held it to be an oblong\r\nrectangle, buoyed up in the midst of the heavens by the compressed air\r\nupon which it rested. Circular maps, however, remained in the popular\r\nfavour long after their erroneousness had been recognized by the\r\nlearned.\r\n\r\nEven Hecataeus of Miletus (549-472 B.C.), the author of a _Periodos_ or\r\ndescription of the earth, of whom Herodotus borrowed the terse saying\r\nthat Egypt was the gift of the Nile, retained this circular shape and\r\ncircumfluent ocean when producing his map of the world, although he had\r\nat his disposal the results of the voyage of Scylax of Caryanda from the\r\nIndus to the Red Sea, of Darius' campaign in Scythia (513), the\r\ninformation to be gathered among the merchants from all parts of the\r\nworld who frequented an emporium like Miletus, and what he had learned\r\nin the course of his own extensive travels. Hecataeus was probably the\r\nauthor of the \"bronze tablets upon which was engraved the whole circuit\r\nof the earth, the sea and rivers\" (Herod, v. 49), which Aristagoras, the\r\ntyrant of Miletus, showed to Cleomenes, the king of Sparta, in 504,\r\nwhose aid he sought in vain in a proposed revolt against Darius, which\r\nresulted disastrously in 494 in the destruction of Miletus. The map of\r\nthe world brought upon the stage in Aristophanes' comedy of _The Clouds_\r\n(423 B.C.), whereon a disciple of the Sophists points out upon it the\r\nposition of Athens and of other places known to the audience, was\r\nprobably of the popular circular type, which Herodotus (iv. 36) not many\r\nyears before had derided and which was discarded by Greek cartographers\r\never after. Thus Democritus of Abdera (b. _c._ 450, d. after 360), the\r\ngreat philosopher and founder, with Leucippus, of the atomic theory, was\r\nalso the author of a map of the inhabited world which he supposed to be\r\nhalf as long again from west to east, as it was broad.\r\n\r\nDicaearcus of Messana in Sicily, a pupil of Aristotle (326-296 B.C.), is\r\nthe author of a topographical account of Hellas, with maps, of which\r\nonly fragments are preserved; he is credited with having estimated the\r\nsize of the earth, and, as far as known he was the first to draw a\r\nparallel across a map.[14] This parallel, or dividing line, called\r\n_diaphragm_ (partition) by a commentator, extended due east from the\r\nPillars of Hercules, through the Mediterranean, and along the Taurus and\r\nImaus (Himalaya) to the eastern ocean. It divided the inhabited world,\r\nas then known, into a northern and a southern half. In compiling his map\r\nhe was able to avail himself of the information obtained by the\r\n_bematists_ (surveyors who determined distances by pacing) who\r\naccompanied Alexander the Great on his campaigns; of the results of the\r\nvoyage of Nearchus from the Indus to the Euphrates, and of the\r\n\"Periplus\" of Scylax of Caryanda, which described the coast from between\r\nIndia and the head of the Arabian Gulf. On the other hand he unwisely\r\nrejected the results of the observations for latitude made by Pytheas in\r\n326 B.C. at his native town, Massilia, and during a subsequent voyage to\r\nnorthern Europe. In the end the map of Dicaearcus resembled that of\r\nDemocritus.\r\n\r\nScientific geography profited largely from the labours of Eratosthenes\r\nof Cyrene, whom Ptolemy Euergetes appointed keeper of the famous\r\nlibrary of Alexandria in 247 B.C., and died in that city in 195 B.C. He\r\nwon fame as having been the first to determine the size of the earth by\r\na scientific method. Having determined the difference of latitude\r\nbetween Alexandria and Syene which he erroneously believed to lie on the\r\nsame meridian, and obtained the distance of those places from each other\r\nfrom the surveys made by Egyptian geometers, he concluded that a degree\r\nof the meridian measured 700 stadia.[15]\r\n\r\nEratosthenes is the author of a treatise which deals systematically with\r\nthe geographical knowledge of his time, but of which only fragments have\r\nbeen preserved by Strabo and others. This treatise was intended to\r\nillustrate and explain his map of the world. In this task he was much\r\nhelped by the materials collected in his library. Among the travellers\r\nof whose information he was thus able to avail himself were Pytheas of\r\nMassilia, Patroclus, who had visited the Caspian (285-282 B.C.),\r\nMegasthenes, who visited Palibothra on the Ganges, as ambassador of\r\nSeleucus Nicator (302-291 B.C.), Timosthenus of Rhodes, the commander of\r\nthe fleet of Ptolemy Philadelphus (284-246 B.C.) who wrote a treatise\r\n\"On harbours,\" and Philo, who visited Meroe on the upper Nile. His map\r\nformed a parallelogram measuring 75,800 stadia from Usisama (Ushant\r\nisland) or Sacrum Promontorium in the west to the mouth of the Ganges\r\nand the land of the Coniaci (Comorin) in the east, and 46,000 stadia\r\nfrom Thule in the north to the supposed southern limit of Libya. Across\r\nit were drawn seven parallels, running through Meroe, Syene, Alexandria,\r\nRhodes, Lysimachia on the Hellespont, the mouth of the Borysthenes and\r\nThule, and these were crossed at right angles by seven meridians, drawn\r\nat irregular intervals, and passing through the Pillars of Hercules,\r\nCarthage, Alexandria, Thapsacus on the Euphrates, the Caspian gates, the\r\nmouth of the Indus and that of the Ganges. The position of all the\r\nplaces mentioned was supposed to have been determined by trustworthy\r\nauthorities. The inhabited world thus delineated formed an island of\r\nirregular shape, surrounded on all sides by the ocean, the Erythrean Sea\r\nfreely communicating with the western ocean. In his text Eratosthenes\r\nignored the popular division of the world into Europe, Asia and Libya,\r\nand substituted for it a northern and southern division, divided by the\r\nparallel of Rhodes, each of which he subdivided into _sphragides_ or\r\n_plinthia_--seals or plinths. The principles on which these divisions\r\nwere made remain an enigma to the present day.\r\n\r\nThis map of Eratosthenes, notwithstanding its many errors, such as the\r\nassumed connexion of the Caspian with a northern ocean and the\r\nsupposition that Carthage, Sicily and Rome lay on the same meridian,\r\nenjoyed a high reputation in his day. Even Strabo (_c._ 30 B.C.) adopted\r\nits main features, but while he improved the European frontier, he\r\nrejected the valuable information secured by Pytheas and retained the\r\nconnexion between the Caspian and the outer ocean. In the extreme east\r\nhis information extended no further than that of Eratosthenes, viz. to\r\nIndia and Taprobane (Ceylon) and the Sacae (Kirghiz).\r\n\r\nHipparchus, the famous astronomer, on the other hand, (_c._ 150 B.C.)\r\nproved a somewhat captious critic. He justly objected to the arbitrary\r\nnetwork of the map of Eratosthenes. The parallels or _climata_[16] drawn\r\nthrough places, of which the longest day is of equal length and the\r\ndecimation (distance) from the equator is the same, he maintained, ought\r\nto have been inserted at equal intervals, say of half an hour, and the\r\nmeridians inserted on a like principle. In fact, he demanded that maps\r\nshould be based upon a regular projection, several descriptions of\r\nwhich he had adopted for his star maps. He moreover accuses\r\nEratosthenes, (whose determination of a degree he accepts without\r\nhesitation) with trusting too much to hypothesis in compiling his map\r\ninstead of having recourse to latitudes and longitudes deduced by\r\nastronomical observations. Such observations, however, were but rarely\r\navailable at the time. A few latitudes had indeed been observed, but\r\nalthough Hipparchus had shown how longitudes could be determined by the\r\nobservation of eclipses, this method was in reality not available for\r\nwant of trustworthy time-keepers. The determination of an ocean\r\nsurrounding the inhabited earth he declared to be based on a mere\r\nhypothesis and that it would be equally allowable to describe the\r\nErythraea as a sea surrounded by land. Hipparchus is not known to have\r\ncompiled a map himself.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Crates of Mallus (d. 145 B.C.) embodied the views of\r\nthe Stoic school of philosophy in a globe which has become typical as\r\none of the insignia of royalty. On this globe an equatorial and a\r\nmeridional ocean divide our earth into four quarters, each inhabited,\r\nthus anticipating the discovery of North and South America and\r\nAustralia.[17]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The Globe of Crates of Mallus.]\r\n\r\nThe period between Eratosthenes and Marinus of Tyre was one of great\r\npolitical importance. Carthage had been destroyed (146 B.C.), Julius\r\nCaesar had carried on his campaign in Gaul (58-51 B.C.), Egypt had been\r\noccupied (30 B.C.), Britannia conquered (A.D. 41-79), and the Roman\r\nempire had attained its greatest extent and power under the emperor\r\nTrajan (A.D. 98-117). But although military operations added to our\r\nknowledge of the world, scientific cartography was utterly neglected.\r\n\r\nAmong Greek works written during this period there are several which\r\neither give us an idea of the maps available at that time, or furnish\r\ninformation of direct service to the compiler of a map. Among the latter\r\na Periplus or coastal guide of the Erythrean Sea, which clearly reveals\r\nthe peninsular shape of India (A.D. 90) and Arrian's _Periplus Ponti\r\nEuxeni_ (A.D. 131) which Festus Avienus translated into Latin. Among\r\ntravellers Eudoxus of Cyzicus occupies a foremost rank, since, between\r\n115-87 B.C. he visited India and the east coast of Africa, which\r\nsubsequently he attempted in vain to circumnavigate by following the\r\nroute of Hanno, along the west coast. Among geographers should be\r\nmentioned Posidonius (135-51), the head of the Stoic school of Rhodes,\r\nwho is stated to be responsible for having reduced the length of a\r\ndegree to 500 stadia; Artemidorus of Ephesus, whose \"Geographumena\" (c.\r\n100 B.C.) are based upon his own travels and a study of itineraries, and\r\nabove all, Strabo, who has already been referred to. Among historians\r\nwho looked upon geography as an important aid in their work are numbered\r\nPolybius (c. 210-120 B.C.), Diodorus Siculus (c. 30 B.C.) and\r\nAgathachidus of Cnidus (c. 120 B.C.) to whom we are indebted for a\r\nvaluable account of the Erythrean Sea and the adjoining parts of Arabia\r\nand Ethiopia. The _Periegesis_ of Dionysius of Alexandria is a popular\r\ndescription of the world in hexameters, of no particular scientific\r\nvalue (c. A.D. 130). He as well as Artemidorus and others accepted a\r\ncircular or ellipsoidal shape of the world and a circumfluent ocean;\r\nStrabo alone adhered to the scientific theories of Eratosthenes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Ptolemy's Map.]\r\n\r\nThe credit of having returned to the scientific principles innovated by\r\nEratosthenes and Hipparchus is due to Marinus of Tyre (c. A.D. 120)\r\nwhich, though no longer occupying the pre-eminent position of former\r\ntimes, was yet an emporium of no inconsiderable importance, having\r\nextensive connexions by sea and land. The map of Marinus and the\r\ndescriptive accounts which accompanied it have perished, but we learn\r\nsufficient concerning them from Ptolemy to be able to appreciate their\r\nmerits and demerits. Marinus was the first who laid down the position of\r\nplaces on a projection according to their latitude and longitude, but\r\nthe projection used by him was of the rudest. Parallels and meridians\r\nwere represented by straight lines intersecting each other at right\r\nangles, the relative proportions between degrees of longitude and\r\nlatitude being retained only along the parallel of Rhodes. The\r\ndistortion of the countries represented would thus increase with the\r\ndistance, north and south, from this central parallel. The number of\r\nplaces whose position had been determined by astronomical observation\r\nwas as yet very small, and the map had thus to be compiled mainly from\r\nitineraries furnished by travellers or the dead reckoning of seamen. The\r\nerrors due to an exaggeration of distances were still further increased\r\non account of his assuming a degree to be equal to 500 stadia, as\r\ndetermined by Posidonius, instead of accepting the 700 stadia of\r\nEratosthenes. He was thus led to assume that the distance from the first\r\nmeridian drawn through the Fortunate islands to Sera (mod. Si-ngan-fu),\r\nthe capital of China, was equal to 225°, which Ptolemy reduced to 177°,\r\nbut which in reality only amount to 126°. A like overestimate of the\r\ndistances covering the march of Julius Maternus to Agisymba, which\r\nMarinus places 24° south of the equator, a latitude which Ptolemy\r\nreduces to 18°, but which is probably no farther south than lat. 12° N.\r\nThe map of Marinus was accompanied by a list of places arranged\r\naccording to latitude and longitude. It must have been much in demand,\r\nfor three editions of it were prepared. Masudi (10th century) saw a copy\r\nof it and declared it to be superior to Ptolemy's map.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nPtolemy (q.v.) was the author of a _Geography_[18] (c. A.D. 150) in\r\neight books. \"Geography,\" in the sense in which he uses the term,\r\nsignifies the delineation of the known world, in the shape of a map,\r\nwhile chorography carries out the same objects in fuller detail, with\r\nregard to a particular country. In Book I. he deals with the principles\r\nof mathematical geography, map projections, and sources of information\r\nwith special reference to his predecessor Marinus. Books II. to VII.\r\nform an index to the maps. They contain about 8000 names, with their\r\nlatitudes and longitudes, and with their aid it is possible to\r\nreconstruct the maps. These maps existed, as a matter of course, before\r\nsuch an index could be compiled, but it is doubtful whether the maps in\r\nour available manuscript, which are attributed to Agathodaemon, are\r\ncopies of Ptolemy's originals or have been compiled, after their loss,\r\nfrom this index. Book VIII. gives further details with reference to the\r\nprincipal towns of each map, as to geographical position, length of day,\r\nclimata, &c.\r\n\r\nPtolemy's great merit consists in having accepted the views of\r\nHipparchus with respect to a projection suited for a map of the world.\r\nOf the two projections proposed by him one is a modified conical\r\nprojection with curved parallels and straight meridians; in the second\r\nprojection (see fig. 3) both parallels and meridians are curved. The\r\ncorrect relations in the length of degrees of latitude and longitude are\r\nmaintained in the first case along the latitude of Thule and the\r\nequator, in the second along the parallel of Agisymba, the equator and\r\nthe parallels of Meroe, Syene and Thule. Following Hipparchus he divided\r\nthe equator into 360° drawing his prime meridian through the Fortunate\r\nIslands (Canaries). The 26 special maps are drawn on a rectangular\r\nprojection. As a map compiler Ptolemy does not take a high rank. In the\r\nmain he copied Marinus whose work he revised and supplemented in some\r\npoints, but he failed to realize the peninsular shape of India,\r\nerroneously exaggerated the size of Taprobane (Ceylon), and suggested\r\nthat the Indian Ocean had no connexion with the western ocean, but\r\nformed Mare Clausum. Ptolemy knew but of a few latitudes which had been\r\ndetermined by actual observation, while of three longitudes resulting\r\nfrom simultaneous observation of eclipses he unfortunately accepted the\r\nleast satisfactory, namely, that which placed Arbela 45° to the east of\r\nCarthage, while the actual meridian distance only amounts to 34°. An\r\neven graver source of error was Ptolemy's acceptance of a degree of 500\r\ninstead of 700 stadia. The extent to which the more correct proportion\r\nwould have affected the delineation of the Mediterranean is illustrated\r\nby fig. 4. But in spite of his errors the scientific method pursued by\r\nPtolemy was correct, and though he was neglected by the Romans and\r\nduring the middle ages, once he had become known, in the 15th century,\r\nhe became the teacher of the modern world.\r\n\r\n_Map-Making among the Romans._--We learn from Cicero, Vitruvius, Seneca,\r\nSuetonius, Pliny and others, that the Romans had both general and\r\ntopographical maps. Thus, Varro (_De rustici_) mentions a map of Italy\r\nengraved on marble, in the temple of Tellus, Pliny, a map of the seat of\r\nwar in Armenia, of the time of the emperor Nero, and the more famous map\r\nof the Roman Empire which was ordered to be prepared for Julius Caesar\r\n(44 B.C.), but only completed in the reign of Augustus, who placed a\r\ncopy of it, engraved in marble, in the Porticus of his sister Octavia (7\r\nB.C.). M. Vipsanius Agrippa, the son-in-law of Augustus (d. 12 B.C.),\r\nwho superintended the completion of this famous map, also wrote a\r\ncommentary illustrating it, quotations from which of Ammianus\r\nMarcellinus of Antioch (d. 330), Pliny and others, afford the only means\r\nof judging of its character. The map is supposed to be based upon actual\r\nsurveys or rather reconnaissances, and if it be borne in mind that the\r\nRoman Empire at that time was traversed in all directions by roads\r\nfurnished with mile-stones, that the Agrimensores employed upon such a\r\nduty were skilled surveyors, and that the official reports of the\r\ncommanders of military expeditions and of provincial governors were\r\navailable, this map, as well as the provincial maps upon which it was\r\nbased, must have been a work of superior excellence, the loss of which\r\nis much to be regretted. A copy of it may possibly have been utilized by\r\nMarinus and Ptolemy in their compilations. The Romans have been\r\nreproached for having neglected the scientific methods of map-making\r\nadvocated by Hipparchus. Their maps, however, seem to have met the\r\npractical requirements of political administration and of military\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nOnly two specimens of Roman cartography have come down to us, viz. parts\r\nof a plan of Rome, of the time of the emperor Septimius Severus (A.D.\r\n193-211), now in the Museo Capitolino, and an _itinerarium scriptum_, or\r\nroad map of the world, compressed within a strip 745 mm. in length and\r\n34 mm. broad. Of its character the reduced copy of one of its 12\r\nsections (fig. 5) conveys an idea. The map, apparently of the 3rd\r\ncentury, was copied by a monk at Colmar, in 1265, who fortunately\r\ncontented himself with adding a few scriptural names, and having been\r\nacquired by the learned Conrad Peutinger of Augsburg it became known as\r\n_Tabula peutingeriana_. The original is now in the imperial library of\r\nVienna.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--A Section of Peutinger's Tabula.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--The World according to Cosmas Indicopleustes\r\n(535).]\r\n\r\n_Map-Making in the Middle Ages._--In scientific matters the early middle\r\nages were marked by stagnation and retrogression. The fathers of the\r\nchurch did not encourage scientific pursuits, which Lactantius (4th\r\ncentury) declared to be unprofitable. The doctrine of the sphericity of\r\nthe earth was still held by the more learned, but the heads of the\r\nchurch held it to be unscriptural. Pope Zachary, when in 741 he\r\ncondemned the views of Virgilius, the learned bishop of Salzburg, an\r\nIrishman who had been denounced as a heretic by St Boniface, declares it\r\nto be _perversa et iniqua doctrina_. Even after Gerbert of Aurillac,\r\nbetter known as Pope Sylvester II. (999-1063), Adam of Bremen (1075),\r\nAlbertus Magnus (d. 1286), Roger Bacon (d. 1294), and indeed all men of\r\nleading had accepted as a fact and not a mere hypothesis the geocentric\r\nsystem of the universe and sphericity of the globe, the authors of maps\r\nof the world, nearly all of whom were monks, still looked in the main to\r\nthe Holy Scriptures for guidance in outlining the inhabited world. We\r\nhave to deal thus with three types of these early maps, viz. an oblong\r\nrectangular, a circular and an oval type, the latter being either a\r\ncompromise between the two former, or an artistic development of the\r\ncircular type. In every instance the inhabited world is surrounded by\r\nthe ocean. The authors of rectangular maps look upon the Tabernacle as\r\nan image of the world at large, and believe that such expressions as the\r\n\"four corners of the earth\" (Isa. x. 12), could be reconciled only with\r\na rectangular world. On the other hand there was the expression \"circuit\r\nof the earth\" (Isa. xl. 22), and the statement (Ezek. v. 5) that \"God\r\nhad set Jerusalem in the midst of the nations and countries.\" In nearly\r\nevery case the East occupies the top of the map. Neither parallels nor\r\nmeridians are indicated, nor is there a scale. Other features frequently\r\nmet with are the Paradise in the Far East, miniatures of towns, plants,\r\nanimals, human beings and monsters, and an indication of the twelve\r\nwinds around the margin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Map of Albi (8th century).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Anglo-Saxon Map of the World (9th century).]\r\n\r\nThe oldest rectangular map of the world is contained in a most valuable\r\nwork written by Cosmas, an Alexandrian monk, surnamed Indicopleustes,\r\nafter returning from a voyage to India (535 A.D.), and entitled\r\n_Christian Topography_. According to Cosmas (fig. 6) the inhabited earth\r\nhas the shape of an oblong rectangle surrounded by an ocean which breaks\r\nin in four great gulfs--the Roman or Mediterranean, the Arabian, Persian\r\nand Caspian Sea. Beyond this ocean lies another world, which was\r\noccupied by man before the Deluge, and within which Cosmas placed the\r\nTerrestrial Paradise. Above this rise the walls of the heavens like unto\r\nthe tent of the Tabernacle. Far more simple is a small map of the world\r\nof the 8th century found in a codex in the library of Albi, an\r\narchiepiscopal seat in the department of Tarn. Its scanty nomenclature\r\nis almost wholly derived from the \"Historiae adversum paganos\" of Paulus\r\nOrosius (418). Far greater interest attaches to the so-called\r\nAnglo-Saxon Map of the World in the British Museum (Cotton MSS.), where\r\nit is bound up in a codex which also contains a copy of the _Periegesis_\r\nof Priscianus. Map and Periegesis are copies by the same hand, but no\r\nother connexion exists between them. More than half the nomenclature of\r\nthe map is derived from Orosius, an annotated Anglo-Saxon version of\r\nwhich had been produced by King Alfred (871-901). The Anglo-Saxons of\r\nthe time were of course well acquainted with Island (first thus named in\r\n870) Slesvic and Norweci (Norway), and there is no need to have recourse\r\nto Adam of Bremen (1076) to account for their presence upon this map.\r\nThe broad features of the map were derived no doubt from an older\r\ndocument which may likewise have served as the basis for the map of the\r\nworld engraved on silver for Charlemagne, and was also consulted by the\r\ncompilers of the Hereford and Ebstorf maps (see fig. 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--T map from Isidor of Seville's _Origines_.]\r\n\r\nThe map or diagram of which Leonardo Dati in his poem on the Sphere\r\n(Della Spera) wrote in 1422 \"un T dentre a uno O mostra il disegno\" (a T\r\nwithin an O shows the design) is one of the most persistent types among\r\nthe circular or wheel maps of the world. It perpetuates the tripartite\r\ndivision of the world by the ancient Greeks and survives in the Royal\r\nOrb. A diagram of this description will be found in Isidor of Seville's\r\n_Origines_ (630), see fig. 9.\r\n\r\nT maps of more elaborate design illustrate the MS. copies of Sallust's\r\n_Bellum jugurthinum_; one of these taken from a codex of the 11th\r\ncentury in the Leipzig town library is shown in fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Map illustrating Sallust's _Bellum jugurthinum_\r\n(11th century, Leipzig).]\r\n\r\nThe outlines of several medieval maps resemble each other to such an\r\nextent that there can be no doubt that they are derived from the same\r\noriginal source. This source by some authors is assumed to have been the\r\nofficial map of the Roman Empire, but if we compare the crude outline\r\ngiven to the Mediterranean with the more correct delineation of Ptolemy,\r\nwho was certainly in a position to avail himself of these official\r\nsources, such an assumption is untenable. The earliest delineation of\r\nthe description has already been referred to as the Anglo-Saxon map of\r\nthe world. Next in the order of age, follows the oval map which Henry,\r\ncanon of Mayence Cathedral, dedicated to Mathilda, consort of the\r\nemperor Henry V. (1110). Of far greater importance is the map seen in\r\nHereford Cathedral. It is the work of Richard of Haldingham, and has a\r\ndiameter of 134 cm. (53 ins.). The \"survey\" ordered by Julius Caesar is\r\nreferred to in the legend, evidently derived from the Cosmography of\r\nAethicus a work widely read at the time, but this does not prove that\r\nthe author was able to avail himself of a map based upon that survey. A\r\nmap essentially identical with that of Hereford, but larger--its\r\ndiameter is 15.6 cm. (6 in.), and consequently fuller of\r\ninformation--was discovered in 1830 in the old monastery of Ebstorf in\r\nHanover. Its date is 1484. Both maps abound in miniature pictures of\r\ntowns, animals, fabulous beings and other subjects. The Hereford map is\r\nsurmounted by a picture of the Day of Judgment. Similar in design,\r\nthough much smaller of scale and oval in form, are the maps which\r\nillustrate the popular _Polychronicon_ of Ranulf Higden, a monk of St\r\nWerburgh's Abbey of Chester (d. 1363).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--The Hereford Map (c. 1280).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--The Map of Beatus (776).]\r\n\r\nPomponius Mela tells us that beyond the Ethiopian Ocean which sweeps\r\nround Africa in the south and the uninhabitable torrid zone, there lies\r\nan _alter orbis_, or fourth part of the world inhabited by\r\n_Antichthones_. On a diagram illustrating the origines of Isidore of\r\nSeville (d. 636) this country is shown, but is described as a _terra\r\ninhabitabilis_. It is shown likewise upon a number of maps which\r\nillustrate the _Commentaries on the Apocalypse_, by Beatus, a\r\nBenedictine monk of the abbey of Valcavado at the foot of the hills of\r\nLiebana in Asturia (776).\r\n\r\nOur little map (fig. 12) is taken from a copy of Beatus' work made in\r\n1203, and preserved at Burgo de Osma in Castille. Similar maps\r\nillustrating the _Commentaries_ exist at St Sever (1050), Paris (1203),\r\nand Tunis; others are rectangular, the oldest being in Lord Ashburnham's\r\nlibrary (970). Beatus, too, describes the southern land as\r\n_inhabitabilis_. The habitable world is divided among the twelve\r\napostles, whose portraits are given. On the maps illustrating the\r\nencyclopaedic _Liber floridus_ by Lambert, a canon of St Omer (1120),\r\nthis south land \"unknown to the sons of Adam,\" is stated to be inhabited\r\n\"according to the philosophers\" by Antipodes. Lambert, indeed, seems to\r\nhave believed in the sphericity of the earth. Fig. 13 shows his map of\r\nthe world reduced from a MS. at Wolfenbüttel, to which is added a\r\ndiagram of the zones from a MS. at Ghent, which illustrates Macrobius'\r\ncommentary on Cicero's _Somnium Scipionis_. Diagrams illustrating the\r\ndivision of the world into climata, are to be found in the _opus majus_\r\nof Roger Bacon (d. 1294) and in Cardinal Pierre d'Ailly's _De imagine\r\nMundi_ (1410).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nAmong countries represented on a larger scale on maps, Palestine not\r\nunnaturally occupies a prominent place in this age of pilgrimages and\r\ncrusades (1095-1291). The maps which accompany St Jerome's translation\r\nof the _Onomasticon_ of St Eusebius (388). The same subject is\r\nillustrated by a picture-map in mosaic, portions of which were\r\ndiscovered in 1896 on the floor of the church of Madaba to the east of\r\nthe Dead Sea. This is the oldest original of a map in existence, for it\r\ndates back to the 6th century. Among more recent maps of Palestine, that\r\nby Petrus Vesconte (1320) is greatly superior to the earlier maps. It\r\nillustrates Marino Sanuto's _Secreta fidelium crucis_, in which its\r\nauthor vainly appeals to Christendom to undertake another crusade. One\r\nof the earliest plans of Jerusalem is contained in _Gesta Francorum_, a\r\nhistory of the Crusades up to 1106, based upon information furnished by\r\nFulcherius of Chartres (c. 1109).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Matthew of Paris (1236-1259).]\r\n\r\nThere existed, no doubt, special maps of European countries, but the\r\nonly documents of that description are two maps of Great Britain, the\r\none of the 12th century, the other by Matthew of Paris, the famous\r\nhistoriographer of the monastery of St Albans (1236-1259).[20]\r\n\r\nCelestial globes were known in the time of Bede; they formed part of the\r\neducational apparatus of the monastic schools. Gerbert of Aurillac is\r\nknown to have made such globes (929). Their manufacture is described by\r\nAlphonso the Wise (1252), as also in _De sphaera solida_ of G. Campanus\r\nof Novara (1303). Terrestrial globes, however, are not referred to.\r\n\r\n_Map-making among the Arabians and other Nations of the East._--Bagdad\r\nearly became a famous seat of learning. Indian astronomers found apt\r\npupils there among the Arabs; the works of Ptolemy were translated into\r\nArabic, and in 827, in the reign of the caliph Abdullah al Mamun, an arc\r\nof the meridian was measured in the plain of Mesopotamia. Most famous\r\namong these Arabian astronomers were Al Batani (d. 998), Ibn Yunis of\r\nCairo (d. 1008), Zarkala (Azarchel), who determined the meridian\r\ndistance between his observatory in Toledo and Bagdad to amount to 51°\r\n30´, an error of 3° only, as compared with Ptolemy's error of 18°, and\r\nAbul Hassan (1230) who reduced the great axis of the Mediterranean to\r\n44°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Idrisi (1154).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Idrisi (1154).]\r\n\r\nFurther materials serviceable to the compilers of maps were supplied by\r\nnumerous Arabian travellers and geographers, among whom Masudi\r\n(915-940), Istakhri (950), Ibn Haukal (942-970), Al Biruni (d. 1038),\r\nIbn Batuta (1325-1356) and Abul Feda (1331-1370), occupy a foremost\r\nplace, yet the few maps which have reached us are crude in the extreme.\r\nMasudi, who saw the maps in the Horismos or Rasm el Ard, a description\r\nof the world by Abu Jafar Mahommed ben Musa of Khiva, the librarian of\r\nthe caliph el Mamun (833), declares them to be superior to the maps of\r\nPtolemy or Marinus, but maps of a later date by Istakhri (950) or Ibn al\r\nWardi (1349) are certainly of a most rudimentary type. Nor can Idrisi's\r\nmap of the world, which was engraved for King Roger of Sicily upon a\r\nsilver plate, or the rectangular map in 70 sheets which accompanies his\r\ngeography (Nushat-ul Mushtat) take rank with Ptolemy's work. These maps\r\nare based upon information collected during many years at the instance\r\nof King Roger. The seven climates adopted by Idrisi are erroneously\r\nsupposed to be equal in latitudinal extent. The Mediterranean occupies\r\nnearly half the inhabited world in longitude, and the east coast of\r\nAfrica is shown as if it extended due east.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians are not known to have produced a terrestrial globe, but\r\nseveral of their celestial globes are to be found in our collections.\r\nThe oldest of these globes was made at Valentia, and is now in the\r\nmuseum of Florence. Another globe (of 1225) is at Velletri; a third by\r\nIbn Hula of Mosul (1275) is the property of the Royal Asiatic Society of\r\nLondon; a fourth (1289) from the observatory of Maragha, in the Dresden\r\nMuseum, two globes of uncertain age at Paris (see fig. 17) and another\r\nin London. All these globes are of metal (bronze), or they might not\r\nhave survived so many years.\r\n\r\nThe charts in use of the medieval navigators of the Indian Ocean--Arabs,\r\nPersians or Dravidas--were equal in value if not superior to the charts\r\nof the Mediterranean. Marco Polo mentions such charts; Vasco da Gama\r\n(1498) found them in the hands of his Indian pilot, and their nature is\r\nfully explained in the _Mohit_ or encyclopaedia of the sea compiled from\r\nancient sources by the Turkish admiral Sidi Ali Ben Hosein in 1554.[21]\r\nThese charts are covered with a close network of lines intersecting each\r\nother at right angles. The horizontal lines are parallels, depending\r\nupon the altitude of the pole star, the Calves of the Little Bear and\r\nthe Barrow of the Great Bear above the horizon. This altitude was\r\nexpressed in _isbas_ or inches each equivalent to 1° 42´ 50´´. Each\r\n_isba_ was divided into _zams_ or eights. The interval between two\r\nparallels thus only amounted to 12´ 51´´. These intervals were mistaken\r\nby the Portuguese occasionally for degrees, which account for Malacca,\r\nwhich is in lat. 2´ 13´´ N., being placed on Cantino's Chart (1502) in\r\nlat. 14´ S. It may have been a map of this kind which accounts for\r\nPtolemy's moderate exaggerations of the size of Taprobana (Ceylon). A\r\nfirst meridian, separating a leeward from a windward region, passed\r\nthrough Ras Kumhari (Comorin) and was thus nearly identical with the\r\nfirst meridian of the Indian astronomers which passed through the sacred\r\ncity of Ujjain (Ozere of Ptolemy) or the meridian of Azin of the Arabs.\r\nAdditional meridians were drawn at intervals of _zams_, supposed to be\r\nequal to three hours' sail.\r\n\r\nIn China, maps in the olden time were engraved on bronze or stone, but\r\nafter the 10th century they were printed from wood-blocks. Among the\r\nmore important productions of more recent times, may be mentioned a map\r\nof the empire, said to be based upon actual surveys by Yhang (721), who\r\nalso manufactured a celestial globe (an older globe by Ho-shing-tien, 4\r\nmetres in circumference, was produced in 450), and an atlas of the\r\nempire on a large scale by Thu-sie-pun (1311-1312) of which new enlarged\r\neditions with many maps were published in the 16th century and in 1799.\r\nNone of these maps was graduated, which is all the more surprising as\r\nthe Chinese astronomers are credited with having made use of the gnomon\r\nas early as 1000 B.C. for determining latitudes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Globe in Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--The Indian Ocean according to Mohit, as\r\ninterpreted by Dr Tomaschek.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of Japan, the earliest reference to a map is of 646, in\r\nwhich year the emperor ordered surveys of certain provinces to be made.\r\n\r\n_Portolano Maps._--During the long period of stagnation in cartography,\r\nwhich we have already dealt with, there survived among the seamen of the\r\nMediterranean charts of remarkable accuracy, illustrating the\r\n_Portolani_ or sailing directories in use among them. Charts of this\r\ndescription are first mentioned in connexion with the Crusade of Louis\r\nXI. in 1270, but they originated long before that time, and in the\r\neastern part of the Mediterranean they embody materials available even\r\nin the days before Ptolemy, while the correct delineation of the west\r\nseems to be of a later date, and may have been due to Catalan seamen.\r\nThese charts are based upon estimated bearings and distances between the\r\nprincipal ports or capes, the intervening coast-line being filled in\r\nfrom more detailed surveys. The bearings were dependent upon the\r\nseaman's observation of the heavens, for these charts were in use long\r\nbefore the compass had been introduced on board ship (as early as 1205,\r\naccording to Guiot de Provins) although it became fully serviceable only\r\nafter the needle had been attached to the compass card, an improvement\r\nprobably introduced by Flavio Gioja of Amalfi in the beginning of the\r\n14th century. The compass may of course have been used for improving\r\nthese charts, but they originated without its aid, and it is therefore\r\nmisleading to describe them as _Compass or Loxodromic_ charts, and they\r\nare now known as _Portolano_ charts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--The Eastern Mediterranean, by Petrus Vesconte\r\n(1311).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--The Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n  a, According to A. Dulceti, 1339, and\r\n  b, On Mercator's projection, according to modern maps.]\r\n\r\nNone of these charts is graduated, and the horizontal and vertical lines\r\nwhich cross many of them represent neither parallels nor meridians.\r\nTheir most characteristic feature, and one by which they can most\r\nreadily be recognized, is presented by groups or systems of rhumb-lines,\r\neach group of these lines radiating from a common centre, the central\r\ngroup being generally encircled by eight or sixteen satellite groups. In\r\nthe course of time the centres of radiation of all these groups had\r\nimposed upon them ornate _rose dei venti_, or windroses, such as may\r\nstill be seen upon our compass-cards. Each chart was furnished with a\r\nscale of miles. These miles, however, were not the ordinary Roman miles\r\nof 1000 paces or 5000 ft., but smaller miles of Greek or Oriental\r\norigin, of which six were equal to five Roman miles, and as the latter\r\nwere equal to 1480 metres, the Portolano miles had a length of only 1233\r\nmetres, and 75.2 of the former, and 90.3 of the latter were equal to a\r\ndegree. The difference between these miles was known, however, only to\r\nthe more learned among the map-makers, and when the charts were extended\r\nto the Atlantic seaboard the two were assumed to be identical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Map illustrating Marino Sanuto's _Liber\r\nsecretorum fidelium crucis_.]\r\n\r\nOn these old charts the Mediterranean is delineated with surprising\r\nfidelity. The meridian distance between the Straits of Gibraltar and\r\nBeirut in Syria amounts upon them to about 3000 Portolano miles, equal\r\nin lat. 36° N. to 40.9°, as compared with an actual difference of 41.2°,\r\nand a difference of 61° assumed by Ptolemy. There exists, however, a\r\nserious error of orientation, due, according to Professor H. Wagner, to\r\nthe inexperience of the cartographers who first combined the charts of\r\nthe separate basins of the Mediterranean so as to produce a chart of the\r\nwhole. This accounts for Gibraltar and Alexandria being shown as lying\r\ndue east and west of each other, although there is a difference of 5° of\r\nlatitude between them, a fact known long before Ptolemy.\r\n\r\nThe production of these charts employed numerous licensed draughtsmen in\r\nthe principal seaports of Italy and Catalonia, and among seamen these\r\nMS. charts remained popular long after the productions of the\r\nprinting-press had become available. The oldest of these maps which have\r\nbeen preserved, the so-called \"Pisan chart,\" which belongs probably to\r\nthe middle of the 13th century, and a set of eight charts, known by the\r\nname of its former owner, the Cavaliere Tamar Luxoro, of somewhat later\r\ndate, are both the work of Genoese artists. Among more eminent Genoese\r\ncartographers are Joannes da Carignano (d. 1344), Petrus Vesconte, who\r\nworked in 1311 and 1327, and is the draughtsman of the maps illustrating\r\nMarino Sanuto's _Liber secretorum fidelium crucis_, which was to have\r\nroused Christendom to engage in another crusade (figs. 19 and 21)\r\nBattista Beccario (1426, 1435) and Bartolomeo Pareto (1455). Venice\r\nranks next to Genoa as a centre of cartographic activity. Associated\r\nwith it are Francesco Pizigano (1367-1373), Francesco de Cesanis (1421),\r\nGiacomo Giroldi (1422-1446), Andrea Bianco (1436-1448) Giovanni Leardo\r\n(1442-1452), Alvise Cadamosto, who was associated with the Portuguese\r\nexplorers on the west coast of Africa (1454-1456) and whose _Portolano_\r\nwas printed at Venice in 1490, and Fra Mauro (1457).\r\n\r\nAssociated with Ancona are Grazioso Benincasa and his son Andreas, whose\r\nnumerous charts were produced between 1461 and 1508, and Count Ortomano\r\nFreducci (1497-1538).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Fra Mauro (1457).]\r\n\r\nThe earliest among Majorcan and Catalonian cartographers is Angelino\r\nDulcert (1325-1339) whom A. Managhi claims as a Genoese, whose true name\r\naccording to him was Angelino Dalorto. Other Catalans are Jahuda\r\nCresques, a Jew of Barcelona, the supposed author of the famous Catalan\r\nmap of the world (1375), Guglielmo Solerio (1384), Mecia de Viladestes\r\n(1413-1433) Gabriel de Valleseche (1439-1447) and Pietro Roselli, a\r\npupil of Beccario of Genoa (1462).\r\n\r\nThese maps were originally intended for the use of seamen navigating the\r\nMediterranean and the coasts of the Atlantic, but in the course of time\r\nthey were extended to the mainland and ultimately developed into maps of\r\nthe whole world as then known. Thus Pizigano's map of 1367 extends as\r\nfar east as the Gulf of Persia, whilst the Medicean map of 1356 (at\r\nFlorence) is remarkable on account of a fairly correct delineation of\r\nthe Caspian, the Shari river in Africa, and the correct direction given\r\nto the west coast of India, which had already been pointed out in a\r\nletter of the friar Giovanni da Montecorvino of 1252. Most of the\r\nexpansions of Portolano maps into maps of the world are circular in\r\nshape, and resemble the wheel maps of an earlier period. This is the\r\ncharacter of the map of Petrus Vesconte of 1320 (fig. 21), of Giovanni\r\nLeardo (1448) and of a Catalan map of 1450. Jerusalem occupies the\r\ncentre of these maps, Arab sources of information are largely drawn\r\nupon, while Ptolemy is neglected and contemporary travellers are\r\nignored. Far superior to these maps is Fra Mauro's map (1457), for the\r\nauthor has availed himself not only of the information collected by\r\nMarco Polo and earlier travellers, but was able, by personal\r\nintercourse, to gather additional information from Nicolo de' Conti, who\r\nhad returned from the east in 1440, and more especially from Abyssinians\r\nwho lived in Italy at that time. His delineation of Abyssinia, though\r\nunduly spread over a wide area, is indeed wonderfully correct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Catalan Map of the World (1375).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Genoese Map (1457).]\r\n\r\nVery different in character is the Catalan map of 1375, for its author,\r\ndiscarding Ptolemy, shows India as a peninsula. On the other hand, an\r\nanonymous Genoese would-be reformer of maps (1457; fig. 24), still\r\nadheres to the erroneous Ptolemaic delineation of southern Asia, and the\r\nsame error is perpetuated by Henricus Marvellus Germanus on a rough map\r\nshowing the Portuguese discoveries up to 1489. None of these maps is\r\ngraduated, but if we give the Mediterranean a length of 3000 Portolano\r\nmiles, equivalent in 36° N. to 41°, then the longitudinal extent of the\r\nold world as measured on the Genoese map of 1457 would be 136° instead\r\nof 177° or more as given by Ptolemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Claudius Clavus Swartha_ (1427).]\r\n\r\n_The Revival of Ptolemy._--Ptolemy's great work became known in western\r\nEurope after Jacobus Angelus de Scarparia had translated it into Latin\r\nin 1410. This version was first printed in 1475 at Vicenza, but its\r\ncontents had become known through MS. copies before this, and their\r\nstudy influenced the construction of maps in two respects. They led\r\nfirstly to the addition of degree lines to maps, and secondly to the\r\ncompilation of new maps of those countries which had been inadequately\r\nrepresented by Ptolemy. Thus Claudius Clavus Swartha (Niger), who was at\r\nRome in 1424, compiled a map of the world, extending westward as far as\r\nGreenland. The learned Cardinal Nicolaus Krebs, of Cusa (Cues) on the\r\nMoselle, who died 1464, drew a map of Germany which was first published\r\nin 1491; D. Nicolaus Germanus, a monk of Reichenbach, in 1466 prepared a\r\nset of Ptolemy's maps on a new projection with converging meridians; and\r\nPaolo del Pozzo Toscanelli in 1474 compiled a new chart on a rectangular\r\nprojection, which was to guide the explorer across the western ocean to\r\nCathay and India.\r\n\r\nOf the seven editions of Ptolemy which were published up to the close of\r\nthe 15th century, all except that of Vicenza (1475) contained Ptolemy's\r\n27 maps, while Francesco Berlinghieri's version (Florence 1478), and two\r\neditions published at Ulm (1482 and 1486), contained four or five modern\r\nmaps in addition, those of Ulm being by Nicolaus Germanus.\r\n\r\nThe geographical ideas which prevailed at the time Columbus started in\r\nsearch of Cathay may be most readily gathered from two contemporary\r\nglobes, the one known as the Laon globe because it was picked up in 1860\r\nat a curiosity shop in that town, the other produced at Nuremberg in\r\n1492 by Martin Behaim.[22] The Laon globe is of copper gilt, and has a\r\ndiameter of 170 mm. The information which it furnishes, in spite of a\r\nlegend intended to lead us to believe that it presents us with the\r\nresults of Portuguese explorations up to the year 1493, is of more\r\nancient date. The Nuremberg globe is a work of a more ambitious order.\r\nIt was undertaken at the suggestion of George Holzschuher, a travelled\r\nmember of the town council. The work was entrusted to Martin Behaim, who\r\nhad resided for six years in Portugal and the Azores, and was believed\r\nto be a thoroughly qualified cosmographer. The globe is of pasteboard\r\ncovered with whiting and parchment, and has a diameter of 507 mm. The\r\nauthor followed Ptolemy not only in Asia, but also in the Mediterranean.\r\nHe did not avail himself of the materials available in his day. Not even\r\nthe coasts of western Africa are laid down correctly, although the\r\nauthor claimed to have taken part in one of the Portuguese expeditions.\r\nThe ocean separating Europe from Asia is assumed as being only 126°\r\nwide, in accordance with Toscanelli's ideas of 1474. Very inadequate use\r\nhas been made of the travels of Marco Polo, Nicolo de' Conti, and of\r\nothers in the east.[23] On the other hand, the globe is made gay with\r\nflags and other decorations, the work of George Glockendon, a well-known\r\nilluminator of the time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe maritime discoveries and surveys of that age of great discoveries\r\nwere laid down upon so-called \"plane-charts,\" that is, charts having\r\nmerely equidistant parallels indicated upon them, together with the\r\nequator, the tropics and polar circles, or, in a more advanced stage,\r\nmeridians also. The astrolabe quadrant or cross-staff enabled the\r\nmariner to determine his latitude with a certain amount of accuracy, but\r\nfor his longitude he was dependent upon dead reckoning, for although\r\nvarious methods for determining a longitude were known, the available\r\nastronomical ephemerides were not trustworthy, and errors of 30° in\r\nlongitude were by no means rare. It was only after the publication of\r\nKepler's _Rudolphine Table_ (1626) that more exact results could be\r\nobtained. A further difficulty arose in connexion with the variation of\r\nthe compass, which induced Pedro Reinel to introduce two scales of\r\nlatitude on his map of the northern Atlantic (1504; fig. 27).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe chart of the world by Juan de la Cosa, the companion of Columbus, is\r\nthe earliest extant which depicts the discoveries in the new world\r\n(1500), Nicolaus de Canerio, a Genoese, and the map which Alberto\r\nCantino caused to be drawn at Lisbon for Hercules d'Este of Ferrara\r\n(1502), illustrating in addition the recent discoveries of the\r\nPortuguese in the East. Other cosmographers of distinction were Pedro\r\nReinel (1504-1542), Nuno Garcia de Toreno (1520), to whom we are\r\nindebted for 21 charts, illustrating Magellan's voyage, Diogo Ribero\r\n(maps of the world 1527, 1529),[24] Alonzo de Santa Cruz, of Seville,\r\nwhose _Isolario general_ includes charts of all parts of the world\r\n(1541), John Rotz or Rut (1542), Sebastian Cabot (1544), as also Nicolas\r\nDesliens, Pierre Desceliers, G. Breton and V. Vallard, all of Arques,\r\nnear Dieppe, whose charts were compiled between 1541 and 1554.\r\n\r\nOf the many general maps of the world or of particular countries, a\r\nlarge number illustrate such works as G. Reisch's _Margarita\r\nphilosophica_ (1163), the cosmographies of Peter Apianus or Bienewitz\r\n(1520, 1522, 1530), Seb. Münster (1544), J. Honter (1546) and Gulielmus\r\nPostel (1561) or the _Geographia_ of Livio Sanuto (1588); others, and\r\nthese the more numerous and important, supplement the original maps of\r\nseveral editions of Ptolemy. Thus the Roman edition of 1507, edited by\r\nMarcus Benaventura and Joa Cota, contains 6 modern maps, and to these\r\nwas added in 1508 Joh. Ruysch's famous map of the world on a modified\r\nconical projection. The next edition published at Venice in 1511\r\ncontained a heart-shaped world by Bernhard Sylvanus. The Strassburg\r\nPtolemy of 1513 has a supplement of as many as 20 modern maps by Martin\r\nWaldseemüller or Ilacomilus, several among which are copied from\r\nPortuguese originals. Waldseemüller was one of the most distinguished\r\ncartographers of his day. He was born at Radolfzell in Baden in 1470,\r\nwas associated with Ringmann at the gymnasium of St Dié, and died in\r\n1521. He published in 1507 a huge map of the world, in 12 sheets,\r\ntogether with a small globe of a diameter of 110 mm., the segments for\r\nwhich were printed from wood-blocks. On these documents the new world is\r\ncalled America, after Amerigo Vespucci, its supposed discoverer. In 1511\r\nWaldseemüller published a large map of Europe, in 1513 he prepared his\r\nmaps for the Strassburg edition of Ptolemy, and in 1516 he engraved a\r\ncopy of Canerio's map of the world. The Strassburg Ptolemy of 1522\r\ncontains Waldseemüller's maps,[25] edited on a reduced scale by\r\nLaurentius Frisius, together with three additional ones. The same set of\r\nmaps is reprinted in the Strassburg edition of 1524, newly translated by\r\nW. Pirckheimer with notes by Joh. Müller Regiomontanus, and in the Lyon\r\nedition of 1535, edited by Michael Servetus. The new maps of the Basel\r\nedition of 1540, twenty-one in number, are by Sebastian Münster; Jacob\r\nGastaldo supplied the Venice edition of 1548 with 34 modern maps, and\r\nthese with a few additions are repeated in Girolamo Ruscelli's Italian\r\ntranslation of Ptolemy published at Venice in 1561.\r\n\r\nEqually interesting with these Ptolemaic supplements are collections\r\nlike that of Anton Lafreri, which contains reprints of 142 maps of all\r\nparts of the world originally published between 1556 and 1572\r\n(_Geografica tavole moderne_, Rome, n.d.), or that of J. F. Camocio,\r\npublished at Venice in 1576, which contains 88 reprints.\r\n\r\nThe number of cartographers throughout Europe was considerable, and we\r\nconfine ourselves to mentioning a few leading men. Among them Germany is\r\nthen represented by G. Glockedon, the author of an interesting road-map\r\nof central Europe (1501), Sebastian Münster (1489-1552), Elias\r\nCamerarius, whose map of the mark of Brandenburg won the praise of\r\nMercator; Wolfgang Latz von Lazius, to whom we are indebted for maps of\r\nAustria and Hungary (1561), and Philip Apianus, who made a survey of\r\nBavaria (1553-1563), which was published 1568 on the reduced scale of\r\n1:144,000, and is fairly described as the topographical masterpiece of\r\nthe 16th century. For maps of Switzerland we are indebted to Konrad\r\nTürst (1495-1497), Johann Stumpf (1548) and Aegidius Tschudi (1538). A\r\nmap of the Netherlands from actual survey was produced by Jacob of\r\nDeventer (1536-1539). Leonardo da Vinci, the famous artist, while in the\r\nservice of Cesare Borgia as military engineer, made surveys of several\r\ndistricts in central Italy. Other Italian cartographers of merit were\r\nGiovanni Battiste Agnese of Venice, whose atlases (1517-1564) enjoyed a\r\nwide popularity; Benedetto Bordone (1528); Giacomo Gastaldo,\r\ncosmographer of the Venetian Republic (1534-1568), and his successor,\r\nPaolo Forlani. New maps of Spain and Portugal appeared in 1560, the\r\nformer being due to Pedro de Medina, the latter to Fernando Alvarez\r\nSecco and Hernando Alvaro. Among the French map-makers of this period\r\nmay be mentioned Oronce Finée (Finaeus), who in 1525 published a map of\r\nFrance, and Jean Jolivet (c. 1560). Gregorio Lilly (1546) and Humphrey\r\nLhuyd of Denbigh (d. 1510) furnished maps of the British Isles, Olaus\r\nMagnus (1539) of Scandinavia, Anton Wied (1542), Sigismund von\r\nHerberstein (1549) and Anthony Jenkinson (1562) of Muscovy.\r\n\r\nThe cylindrical and modified conical projections of Marinus and Ptolemy\r\nwere still widely used, the stereographical projection of Hipparchus,\r\nwas for the first time employed for terrestrial maps in the 16th\r\ncentury, but new projections were introduced in addition to these. The\r\nearliest of these, a trapeziform projection with equidistant parallels,\r\nby D. Nicolaus Germanus (1466), naturally led to what is generally known\r\nas Flamsteed's projection. Joh. Stabius (1502) and his pupil J. Werner\r\n(1514) devised three heart-shaped projections, one of which was\r\nequivalent. Petrus Apianus (1524) gave his map an elliptical shape. H.\r\nGlareanus (1510) was the first to employ an equidistant zenithal polar\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\nNo reasonable fault can be found with the marine surveyors of this\r\nperiod, but the scientific cartographers allowed themselves too\r\nfrequently to be influenced by Ptolemaic traditions. Thus Gastaldo\r\n(1548) presents us with a map of Italy, which, except as to\r\nnomenclature, differs but little from that of Ptolemy, although on the\r\nPortolano charts the peninsula had long since assumed its correct shape.\r\nMany of the local maps, too, were excellent specimens of cartography,\r\nbut when we follow any cartographer of the period into regions the\r\nsuccessful delineation of which depended upon an intelligent\r\ninterpretation of itineraries, and of information collected by recent\r\ntravellers, they are generally found to fail utterly. This is\r\nillustrated by the four sketch maps shown in fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nColumbus, trusting to Toscanelli's misleading chart, looked upon the\r\ncountries discovered by him as belonging to eastern Asia, a view still\r\nshared about 1507 by his brother Bartolomeo. Waldseemüller (1507) was\r\nthe first to separate America and Asia by an ocean of considerable\r\nwidth, but J. Ruysch (1508) returns to the old idea, and even joins\r\nGreenland (Gruenlant) to eastern Asia. Bologninus Zalterius on a map of\r\n1566, and Mercator on his famous chart of 1569, separates the two\r\ncontinents by a narrow strait which they call Streto de Anian, thus\r\nanticipating the discovery of Bering Strait by more than a hundred and\r\nfifty years. Anian, however, which they place upon the American coast,\r\nis no other than Marco Polo's Anica or Anin, our modern Annam. Such an\r\nerror could never have arisen had the old compilers of maps taken the\r\ntrouble to plan Marco Polo's routes.\r\n\r\n_Globes_, both celestial and terrestrial, became popular after the\r\ndiscovery of America. They were included among the scientific apparatus\r\nof ships and of educational establishments. Columbus and Magellan had\r\nsuch globes, those of the latter produced by P. Reinel (1519), and\r\nConrad Celtes tells us that he illustrated his lectures at the\r\nuniversity of Vienna with the help of globes (1501). Globes were still\r\nengraved on copper, or painted by hand, but since 1507, in which year\r\nWaldseemüller published a small globe of a diameter of 110 mm., covered\r\nwith printed segments or gores, this cheap and expeditious method has\r\ncome into general use. Waldseemüller constructed his gores graphically,\r\nA. Dürer (1525) and Hen. Loriti Glareanus (1527) were the first who\r\ndealt scientifically with the principles underlying their construction.\r\nGlobes covered with printed gores were produced by L. Boulenger (1514),\r\nJoh. Schöner (1515), P. Apianus, Gemma Frisius (1530) and G. Mercator\r\n(1541). Leonardo da Vinci's rough map of the world in 8 segments (c.\r\n1513) seems likewise to have been intended for a globe. Of J. Schöner we\r\nknow that he produced four globes, three printed from segments (1515,\r\n1523, 1533), and one of larger size (diam. 822 mm.), which is drawn by\r\nhand, and is preserved in the Germanic Museum at Nuremberg. Among\r\nengraved globes, one of the most interesting is that which was\r\ndiscovered by R. M. Hunt in Paris, and is preserved in the Lenox\r\nLibrary, New York. Its diameter is only 4½ in. (127 mm.). The so-called\r\n\"Nancy globe\" is of chased silver, richly ornamented, and formerly\r\nserved the purpose of a pyx. Its diameter is 160 mm., its date about\r\n1530. About the same date is assigned to a globe by Robert de Bailly,\r\nengraved on copper and gilt (diam. 440 mm.). Celestial globes were\r\nmanufactured by Regiomontanus (d. 1476) at Nuremberg, by Joh. Stöffler\r\n(1499), and by G. Hartmann (1535).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Lenox Globes (1510).]\r\n\r\n_Mercator and his Successors._--Of Gerhard Kremer (1512-1594) the\r\nearliest works are a map of Palestine (1537), a map of the world on a\r\ndouble heart-shaped projection (1525), and a topographical map of\r\nFlanders based upon his own surveys (1540), a pair of globes (1541,\r\ndiam. 120 mm.), and a large map of Europe which has been praised\r\ndeservedly for its accuracy (1554). He is best known by his marine chart\r\n(1569) and his atlas. The projection of the former may have been\r\nsuggested by a note by W. Pirkheimer in his edition of Ptolemy (1525).\r\nMercator constructed it graphically, the mathematical principles\r\nunderlying it being first explained by E. Wright (1594). The \"Atlas\" was\r\nonly published after Mercator's death, in 1595. It only contained nine\r\nmaps, but after the plates had been sold to Jodocus (Jesse) Hondius the\r\nnumber of maps was rapidly increased, although Mercator's name was\r\nretained. Mercator's maps are carefully engraved on copper. Latin\r\nletters are used throughout; the miniatures of older maps are superseded\r\nby symbols, and in the better-known countries the maps are fairly\r\ncorrect, but they fail lamentably when we follow their author into\r\nregions--the successful delineation of which depends upon a critical\r\ncombination of imperfect information.\r\n\r\nEven before Mercator's death, Antwerp and Amsterdam had become great\r\ncentres of cartographic activity, and they maintained their pre-eminence\r\nuntil the beginning of the 18th century. Abraham Ortelius (1527-1592),\r\nof Antwerp, a man of culture and enterprise, but not a scientific\r\ncartographer, published the first edition of his _Theatrum orbis\r\nterrarum_ in 1570. It then contained 53 maps, by various authors. By\r\n1595 the number of maps had increased to 119, including a _Parergon_ or\r\nsupplement of 12 maps illustrating ancient history. In 1578 was\r\npublished the _Speculum orbis terrarum_ of Gerard de Jude or de Judaeis.\r\nLucas Janszon Waghenaer (Aurigarius) of Enkhuizen published the first\r\nedition of his _Spiegel der Zeevaart_ (Mariners' Mirror) at Leiden in\r\n1585. It was the first collection of marine maps, lived through many\r\neditions, was issued in several languages and became known as\r\n_Charettier_ and _Waggoner_. In the same year Adrian Gerritsz published\r\na valuable _Paskaarte_ of the European Sea. Ten years afterwards, in\r\n1595, W. Barentszoon published a marine atlas of the Mediterranean, the\r\nmajor axis of which he reduced to 42 degrees. Jodocus Hondius has\r\nalready been referred to as the purchaser of Mercator's plates. The\r\nbusiness founded by him about 1602 was continued by his sons and his\r\nson-in-law, Jan Janszon (Jansonius) and others. By 1653 this firm had\r\nalready produced atlases including 451 charts. Willem Janszon, the\r\nfather of Hondius's partner, published a collection of charts (1608), to\r\nwhich he gave the title of _Het Licht der Zeevaart_ (the seaman's\r\nlight). Another cartographic publishing firm was established at\r\nAmsterdam in 1612 by Willem Janszon Blaeu (1571-1638), a friend of Tycho\r\nBrahe, from 1633 \"mapmaker\" of the states-general, and a man of\r\nscientific culture. He was succeeded by his son Jan (d. 1673) and\r\ngrandson Cornelius, and before the end of the century turned out a\r\n_Zee-Spiegel_ of 108 charts (1623), an _Atlas novus_ (_Nieuwe Atlas_),\r\n1642, enlarged in the course of time until it consisted of 12 folio\r\nvolumes containing hundreds of maps. J. A. Colom in 1633 published a\r\ncollection of maps under the quaint title of _Vurig Colom der Zeevaert_\r\n(Fiery Column of Navigation). Among more recent Dutch map publishers are\r\nNicolaus Vischer (Piscator), R. Goos, H. Doncker, F. de Wit, and J. and\r\nG. van Keulen, whose atlases were published between 1681 and 1722. These\r\nDutch maps and charts are generally accompanied by descriptive notes or\r\nsailing directions printed on the back of them. A similar work is the\r\n_Arcano del mare_ of Sir Robert Dudley, duke of Northumberland, the\r\nnumerous sheets of which are on Mercator's projection (1631).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Mercator's Chart of the World (1569).]\r\n\r\nIn France, in the meantime, an arc of the meridian had been measured\r\n(1669-1670) by Jean Picard, numerous longitudes had been observed\r\nbetween 1672 and 1680 by the same, and by Phil. de Lahire (d. 1719), and\r\nthese were utilized in a _Carte de France_ \"as corrected from the\r\nobservations of the members of the Academy of Sciences\" (1666-1699), in\r\na map of the world (1694) by D. Cassini, as also in _Le Neptune\r\nFrançois_ (1693) with contributions by Pene, D. Cassini and others.\r\nThese corrected longitudes were not yet available for the maps produced\r\nby Nicolas Sanson of Abbeville, since 1627. The cartographical\r\nestablishment founded by him in that year was carried on after his death\r\nin 1667 by his sons, his son-in-law, P. Duval (d. 1683) and his grandson\r\nRobert du Vaugondy (d. 1766). Among the cartographers whom he employed\r\nwere M. Tavernier and Mariette, and in many instances he mentioned the\r\nauthors whose maps he copied. By 1710 the maps published by the firm\r\nnumbered 466. Nicolas de Fer, the great rival of Sanson, and his heirs,\r\nare stated to have published as many as 600 maps after 1700.\r\n\r\nIn no other country of Europe was there at the close of the 16th century\r\na geographical establishment capable of competing with the Dutch towns\r\nor with Sanson, but the number of those who produced maps, in many\r\ninstances based upon original surveys, was large. Germany is thus\r\nrepresented, among others, by C. Henneberger (map of Prussia, 1576), by\r\nM. Oeder, (survey of Saxony, 1586-1607), A. Rauh (fine hill features on\r\na map of the environs of Wangen and Lindau, 1617), W. Schickhardt\r\n(survey of Württemberg, 1624-1635), and G. M. Vischer (map of Austria\r\nand Styrai, 1669-1786); Switzerland by H. C. Gyger (Canton of Zürich, a\r\nmasterpiece, 1667); Italy by G. A. Magini (1558-1610), and V. Coronelli,\r\nappointed cosmographer of the Venetian Republic, 1685, and founder of\r\nthe Ac. Cosmogr. dei Argonauti, the earliest geographical society, and\r\nDiogo Homem, a Portuguese settled at Venice (1558-1574); Denmark by J.\r\nMejer of Husum (1650); Sweden by A. Buraeus, the \"father of Swedish\r\ncartographers\" (1650-1660); the British Islands by Ch. Saxton (County\r\nAtlas of England and Wales 1575), J. Speed (_Theatrum_ of Great Britain,\r\n1610), Timothy Pont and Robert Gordon of Strathloch (map of Scotland,\r\n1608), and A. Moll. A _Novus atlas sinensis_, based upon Chinese\r\nsurveys, was published in 1655 by Martin Martini, S.J., a missionary\r\nrecently returned from China. Isaac Voss, in his work _De Nili_ (1659),\r\npublished a map of central Africa, in which he anticipated D'Anville by\r\nrejecting all the fanciful details which found a place upon Filippo\r\nPigafetta's map of that continent.\r\n\r\nThe first maps illustrating the variation of the compass were published\r\nby Chris. Burrus (d. 1632) and Athanasius Kircher (_Magnes_, Rome,\r\n1643), and maps of the ocean and tidal currents by the latter in his\r\n_Mundus subterraneus_ (1665). Edmund Halley, the astronomer, compiled\r\nthe first variation chart of scientific value (1683), as also a chart of\r\nthe winds (1686).\r\n\r\nGlobes manufactured for commercial purposes by Blaeu and others have\r\nalready been mentioned, but several large globes, for show rather than\r\nfor use, were produced in addition to these. Thus A. Busch, of Limburg\r\n(1656-1664), manufactured a globe for Duke Frederick of Holstein,\r\nformerly at Gottorp, but since 1713 at Tsarskoye Zelo. It has a diameter\r\nof 11 ft. (3.57 metres) and is hollow, the inner surface of the shell\r\nbeing covered with a star map, and the outer surface with a map of the\r\nworld. Professor Erh. Weigel (1696) produced a hollow celestial globe in\r\ncopper, having a small terrestrial globe in its centre. Its diameter is\r\n3.25 metres. Lastly there is a pair of giant globes of artistic design,\r\nturned out by V. Coronelli (1623), and intended as presents to Louis\r\nXIV. Their diameter is nearly 5 metres. A pair of globes of 1592 by\r\nEmeric Molineux (diam. 610 mm.) is now in the Temple Library, and is\r\nreferred to in Blundeville's _Exercises_ (1594).\r\n\r\n_The Eighteenth Century._--It was no mere accident which enabled France\r\nto enjoy a pre-eminence in cartographic work during the greater part of\r\nthe 18th century. Not only had French men of science and scientific\r\ntravellers done excellent work as explorers in different parts of the\r\nworld, but France could also boast of two men, Guillaume Delisle and J.\r\nB. Bourguignon d'Anville, able to utilize in the compilation of their\r\nmaps the information they acquired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\nDelisle (1675-1726) published 98 maps, and although as works of art they\r\nwere inferior to the maps of certain contemporaries, they were far\r\nsuperior to them in scientific value. On one of his earliest maps\r\ncompiled under advice of his father Claude (1700), he gave the\r\nMediterranean its true longitudinal extension of 41°. It was Delisle who\r\nassumed the meridian of Ferro, which had been imposed upon French\r\nnavigators by royal order (1634), to lie exactly 20° to the west of\r\nParis. The work of reform was carried further by B. D'Anville\r\n(1697-1782). Altogether he published 211 maps, of which 66 are included\r\nin his _Atlas général_ (1737-1780); he swept away the fanciful lakes\r\nfrom off the face of Africa, thus forcibly bringing home to us the\r\npoverty of our knowledge (fig. 32), delineated the Chinese Empire in\r\naccordance with the map based on the surveys conducted during the reign\r\nof the emperor Kanghi, with the aid of Jesuit missionaries, and\r\npublished in 1718; boldly refused to believe in the existence of an\r\nAntarctic continent covering half the southern hemisphere, and always\r\nbrought a sound judgment to bear upon the materials which the\r\never-increasing number of travellers placed at his disposal. Among other\r\nFrench works of importance deserving notice are _Le Neptune oriental_ of\r\nMannevillette (1745) and more especially the _Carte géometrique de la\r\nFrance_, which is based upon surveys carried on (1744-1783) by César\r\nFrançois Cassini de Thury and his son Dominique de Cassini. It is on a\r\ntransversal cylindrical (rectangular) projection devised by Jacques\r\nCassini (d. 1746). The hills are shown in rough hachures.\r\n\r\nEngland, which had entered upon a career of naval conquest and\r\nscientific exploration, had reason to be proud of J. F. W. Desbarres,\r\n_Atlantic Neptune_ (1774), a North-American Pilot (1779), which first\r\nmade known the naval surveys of J. Cook and of others; and Tho.\r\nJefferys's _West Indian_ and _American Atlases_ (1775, 1778). James\r\nRennell (1742-1830), who was surveyor-general of India, published the\r\n_Bengal Atlas_ (1781), and sagaciously arranged the vast mass of\r\ninformation collected by British travellers and others in India and\r\nAfrica, but it is chiefly with the name of Aaron Arrowsmith, who came to\r\nLondon in 1778, and his successors, with which the glory of the older\r\nschool of cartographers is most intimately connected. His nephew John\r\ndied in 1873. Among local cartographers may be mentioned H. Moll (d.\r\n1732), J. Senex, whose atlas was published in 1725, and Dowet, whose\r\natlas was brought out at the expense of the duke of Argyll.\r\n\r\nIn Germany J. B. Homann (d. 1724) founded a geographical establishment\r\nin 1702, which depended at first upon copies of British and French maps,\r\nbut in course of time published also original maps such as J. M. Hase's\r\n_Africa_ (1727) and Tobias Meyer's _Mappa critica_ of Germany (1780), J.\r\nT. Güssfeld's map of Brandenburg (1773), John Majer's Württemburg\r\n(1710), and J. C. Müller's Bavaria, both based on trigonometrical\r\nsurveys. Colonel Schmettau's excellent survey of the country to the west\r\nof the Weser (1767-1787) was never published, as Frederick the Great\r\nfeared it might prove of use to his military enemies. Switzerland is\r\nrepresented by J. J. Scheuchzer (1712), J. Gessner (d. 1790), G. Walser\r\n(_Atlas novus Helvetiae_, 1769), and W. R. Meyer, _Atlas der Schweiz_\r\n(1786-1802). Of the Austrian Netherlands, Count Joseph de Ferrari\r\npublished a chorographic map on the same scale as Cassini's _Carte de la\r\nFrance_ (1777). Of Denmark a fine map was published under the auspices\r\nof the Academy of Science of Copenhagen (1766-1825); of Spain and\r\nPortugal an atlas in 102 sheets by Thomas Lopez (1765-1802); of Russia a\r\nmap by J. N. Delisle in 19 sheets (1730-1745); charts illustrating the\r\nvariation of the compass and of magnetic \"dip\" by E. Dunn (1776), J. C.\r\nWiffe (1768); a chart of the world by W. Dampier (1789). Map projections\r\nwere dealt with by two eminent mathematicians, J. H. Lambert (1772) and\r\nLeonh. Euler (1777).\r\n\r\nOn the maps of Delisle and d'Anville the ground is still represented by\r\n\"molehills.\" Hachures of a rude nature first made their appearance on\r\nDavid Vivier's map of the environs of Paris (1674), and on Cassini's\r\n_Carte de la France_. Contour lines (isobaths) were introduced for the\r\nfirst time on a chart of the Merwede by M. S. Cruquius (1728), and on a\r\nchart of the English Channel by Phil. Buache (1737). Dupain-Triel,\r\nacting on a suggestion of Du Carla, compiled a contoured map of France\r\n(1791), and it only needed the introduction of graduated tints between\r\nthese contours to secure a graphic picture of the features of the\r\nground. It was J. G. Lehmann (1783) who based his method of hill-shading\r\nor hachuring upon these horizontal contours. More than 80 methods of\r\nshowing the hills have found advocates since that time, but all methods\r\nmust be based upon contours to be scientifically satisfactory.\r\n\r\nTwo relief maps of Central Switzerland deserve to be mentioned, the one\r\nby R. L. Pfyffer in wax, now in Lucerne, the other by J. R. Meyer of\r\nAarau and Müller of Engelberg in papier mâché, now in Zurich. Globes of\r\nthe usual commercial type were manufactured in France by Delisle (1700),\r\nForbin (1710-1731), R. and J. de Vaugondy (1752), Lalande (1771); in\r\nEngland by E. and G. Adams (1710-1766); Germany by Homann and Seutter\r\n(1750). A hollow celestial globe 18 ft. in diameter was set up by Dr\r\nRoger Long at Cambridge; the terrestrial globe which Count Ch. Gravie of\r\nVergennes presented to Louis XVI. in 1787 had a diameter of 26 metres,\r\nor 85 ft.\r\n\r\n_Modern Cartography._--The compiler of maps of the present day enjoys\r\nmany advantages not enjoyed by men similarly occupied a hundred years\r\nago. Topographical surveys are gradually extending, and explorers of\r\nrecent years are better trained for their work than they were a\r\ngeneration ago, whilst technical processes of recent invention--such as\r\nlithography, photography and heliogravure--facilitate or expedite the\r\ncompletion of his task. This task, however, has grown more difficult and\r\nexacting. Mere outline maps, such as formerly satisfied the public,\r\nsuffice no longer. He is called upon more especially to give a\r\nsatisfactory delineation of the ground, he must meet the requirements of\r\nvarious classes of the public, and be prepared to record\r\ncartographically all the facts of physical or political geography which\r\nare capable of being recorded on his maps. The ingenuity of the compiler\r\nis frequently taxed when called upon to illustrate graphically the\r\nresults of statistical information of every description.\r\n\r\nGermany since the middle of the 19th century has become the headquarters\r\nof scientific cartography. This is due as much to the inspiriting\r\nteachings of Ritter and Humboldt as to the general culture and\r\nscientific training combined with technical skill commanded by the men\r\nwho more especially devote themselves to this branch of geography, which\r\nelsewhere is too frequently allowed to fall into the hands of mere\r\nmechanics. Men like H. Berghaus (1797-1884), H. Kiepert (1818-1899), and\r\nA. Petermann (1822-1878) must always occupy a foremost place in the\r\nhistory of cartography. Among the geographical establishments of\r\nGermany, that founded by Justus Perthes (1785), at Gotha, occupies the\r\nhighest rank. Among its publications are A. Stieler's _Hand-Atlas_\r\n(1817-1832), K. von Spruner's _Historical Atlas_ (1438-1488), H.\r\nBerghaus' _Physical Atlas_ (1838-1842), E. von Sydow's _Wall Maps for\r\nSchools_ (1838-1840) and _School Atlas_ (1847). The titles of these\r\natlases survive, though the authors of the original editions are long\r\ndead, and the maps have been repeatedly superseded by others bringing\r\nthe information up to the date of publication. To the same firm we are\r\nindebted for Petermann's _Mitteilungen_, started in 1855 by A.\r\nPetermann, after whose death in 1902 they were successively edited by E.\r\nBehm, A. Supan and P. Langhans, as also the _Geographisches Jahrbuch_\r\n(since 1866), at first edited by E. Behm, afterwards by Professor H.\r\nWagner. Among other geographical institutes in Germany which deserve\r\nmention are the Weimar Institut, founded in 1791 by F. J. Bertuch, and\r\ndirected in 1845-1852 by H. Kiepert; Paul Fleming at Glogau (K. Sohr's\r\nHandatlas, 1845), A. Ravenstein at Frankfort, D. Reimer at Berlin (H.\r\nKiepert, _Handatlas_, 1860); R. Andree (_Hand-Atlas_, 1880), and E.\r\nDebes (_Hand-Atlas_, 1894) in Leipzig, and E. Hölzer in Vienna (Vincenz\r\nvon Haardt's maps). France is represented by the publishing firms of Ch.\r\nDelagrave (Levaseur's maps), Hachette (Vivien de St Martin's _Atlas\r\nuniversel_, in progress since 1875, F. Schrader's _Atlas de géographie\r\nmoderne_, 1880), and Armand Colin (Vidal de la Blache's _Atlas général_,\r\n1894). In Great Britain A. Arrowsmith established himself in London in\r\n1770 (_General Atlas_, 1817), but the cartographical business ceased on\r\nthe death of John Arrowsmith in 1873. John Walker, to whose initiative\r\nthe charts published by the admiralty are indebted for the perspicuous,\r\nfirm and yet artistic execution, which facilitate their use by the\r\nmariner, was also the author of the maps published by the Society for\r\nthe Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1820-1840). Among more recent firms\r\nare W. and A. K. Johnston (founded 1825; _Royal Atlas_, 1855); J.\r\nBartholomew & Co., now carried on by J. G. Bartholomew (Reduced Survey\r\nmaps, _Atlas of the World's Commerce_, 1906); Philip & Sons (_Imperial\r\nAtlas_, 1890; _Systematic Atlas_ by E. G. Ravenstein, 1894; _Mercantile\r\nMarine Atlas_, 1904, globes), and E. Stanford (_London Atlas_).\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Professor A. Penck proposed to prepare a map of the world,\r\nincluding the oceans, on a scale of 1:1,000,000, and his scheme was\r\npromised the support of a committee which met in London in 1909, and\r\nupon which were represented the leading powers of the world. Maps on\r\nthat scale of a great part of Africa, Asia and America have been\r\npublished by British, French, German and United States authorities. A\r\nbathymetrical chart of the oceans, by Professor J. Thoulet was published\r\nin 1904 at the expense of Prince Albert of Monaco.\r\n\r\nReliefs from printed maps were first produced by Bauerkeller of\r\nDarmstadt and Dondorf at Frankfort, from originals furnished by A.\r\nRavenstein (1838-1844). The exaggeration in altitude, on these maps and\r\non those of a later date and on a larger scale, was very considerable.\r\nNo such exaggeration exists in the case of reliefs of parts of the Alps,\r\non a large scale, by P. Keil and Pelikan (1890), X. Imfeld (1891), P.\r\nOberlerchner (1891-1895), C. Perron (1893-1900), F. Becker (1900), A.\r\nHeim (1904) and others. A relief globe was first suggested in a letter\r\nof M. Maestlin to J. Kepler (1596). The first globe of this description\r\nfor the use of the blind, was made by A. Zeune in 1810. H. Erben is the\r\nauthor of a rough relief on a convex surface (1842), but the finest\r\nexample of this description is a relief of Italy, by César Pomba and H.\r\nFritsche, on a scale of 1:1,000,000 and without exaggeration of heights\r\n(1880-1884). A map of Italy in the baptistery of St Peter at Rome has\r\noccasionally been described as a relief, though it is merely a rude\r\noutline map of Italy, by Carlo Fontana (1698), carved into a convex\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nSeveral globes of unusual dimensions were produced in the course of last\r\ncentury. That which Colonel Langlois erected in the Champs Elysées\r\n(1824) had a diameter of 39 metres. James Wyld's hollow globe, or\r\n\"Georama,\" diam. 18 metres, occupied Leicester Square until swept away\r\nas a nuisance. The giant globe proposed by Elisée Reclus in 1895 has\r\nnever been erected; he has, however, produced maps on a concave surface,\r\nas suggested by J. D. Hauber in 1742.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--The history of maps is dealt with ably in Vivien de\r\n  Saint Martin's _Histoire de la géographie_ (Paris, 1875), and in\r\n  Peschel's _Geschichte der Erdkunde_ (2nd ed. by Sophus Ruge, Berlin,\r\n  1877), as also by W. Wollkenhauer (_Leitfaden zur Geschichte der\r\n  Kartographie_, Breslau, 1895), and H. Zondervan (_Allgemeine\r\n  Kartenkunde_, Leipzig, 1901). J. Lelewel's _Geographie du moyen âge_,\r\n  with an atlas (Brussels, 1850-1857), has in part been superseded by\r\n  more recent researches. There are, however, a number of works,\r\n  beautifully illustrated, which deal fully with particular periods of\r\n  the subject. Among these may be mentioned Konrad Miller's _Die\r\n  ältesten Weltkarten_ (Stuttgart, 1895-1897), which only deals with\r\n  maps not influenced by the ideas of Ptolemy. The contents of the\r\n  following collections are more varied in their nature, viz. E. F.\r\n  Jomard's _Monuments de la géographie_ (Paris, 1862), Santarem's _Atlas\r\n  composé de mappemondes et de portulans_, &c. (Paris, 1842-1853, 78\r\n  plates). A. E. Nordenskiöld's _Facsimile Atlas_ (Stockholm, 1889),\r\n  Gabriel Marcell, _Choix de cartes et de mappemondes XIV^e et XV^e\r\n  siècles_ (Paris, 1896). C. H. Coote's _Remarkable Maps of the XVth,\r\n  XVIth and XVIIth Centuries reproduced in their Original Size_\r\n  (Amsterdam, 1894-1897), and _Bibliotheca lindesiana_ (London, 1898)\r\n  with facsimiles of the Harleian and other Dieppese maps of the 16th\r\n  century. Nautical charts are dealt with in A. E. Nordenskiöld's\r\n  _Periplus_ (Stockholm, 1869), and Th. Fischer's _Sammlung\r\n  mittelälterlicher Welt- und Seekarten_ (Vienna, 1886). The discovery\r\n  and mapping of America are illustrated by F. Kunstmann's _Entdeckung\r\n  Amerikas_ (Munich, 1859), K. Kretschmer's _Atlas zur Entdeckung\r\n  Amerikas_ (Berlin, 1892), G. Marcel's _Reproductions de cartes et de\r\n  globes relatives à la découverte de l'Amérique du XVI^e au XVIII^e\r\n  siècle_ (Paris, 1893) and E. L. Stevenson's _Maps Illustrating the\r\n  early Discovery and Exploration of America, 1502-1530_ (New Brunswick,\r\n  N.J., 1906). In addition to these collections, numerous single maps\r\n  have been published in geographical periodicals or separately. See\r\n  also V. Hantzsch and L. Schmidt, _Kartog. Denkmäler zur\r\n  Entdeckungsgeschichte von Amerika, Asien, Australien und Afrika aus\r\n  der k. Bibliothek zu Dresden_ (Leipzig, 1903), and the Crown\r\n  Collection of photographs of American maps (1600-1800), selected and\r\n  edited by A. B. Hulbert (Cleveland, 1904-1909).\r\n\r\n  For reports on the progress of cartography, see _Geographisches\r\n  Jahrbuch_ (Gotha, since 1866); for announcements of new publications,\r\n  _Bibliotheca geographica_, published annually by the Berlin\r\n  Geographical Society, and to the _geographical Journal_ (London).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Topographical Surveys._\r\n\r\n  United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe year 1784 marks the beginning of the ordnance survey, for in that\r\nyear Major-General Roy measured a base line of 27,404 ft. on Hounslow\r\nHeath. Six additional base lines were measured up to 1849, including the\r\nLough Foyle, in 1827-1828, and that on Salisbury Plain, in 1849. The\r\nprimary triangulation was only completed in 1858, but in the meantime,\r\nin 1791, the detail survey had begun. At first it was merely intended to\r\nproduce a map sufficiently accurate on a scale of 1 in. to a mile\r\n(1:63,360). Ireland having been surveyed (1824-1842) on a scale of 6 in.\r\nto a mile (1:10,560), it was determined in 1840, after the whole of\r\nEngland and Wales, with the exception of Lancashire and Yorkshire, had\r\nbeen completed on one-inch scales, to adopt that scale for the whole of\r\nthe United Kingdom. Finally, in 1854, a cadastral survey of the whole of\r\nthe United Kingdom, only excepting uncultivated districts, was resolved\r\nupon, on a scale of 1:2500, still larger scales (1:500 or 1:1000) being\r\nadopted for town plans. Parish boundaries are laid down with the help of\r\nlocal meresmen appointed by justices at quarter sessions. The horizontal\r\ncontours are based upon instrumental measurement, and as a whole these\r\nordnance maps were undoubtedly superior in accuracy, with rare\r\nexceptions, to similar maps published by foreign governments. Even\r\nthough the hill hachures on the older one-inch maps are not quite\r\nsatisfactory, this deficiency is in a large measure compensated for by\r\nthe presence of absolutely trustworthy contours. Originally the maps\r\nwere engraved on copper, and the progress of publication was slow; but\r\nsince the introduction of modern processes, such as electrotyping (in\r\n1840), photography (in 1855) and zincography (in 1859), it has been\r\nrapid. A plan, the engraving of which formerly took two years, can now\r\nbe produced in two days.\r\n\r\nThe one-inch map for the whole of the United Kingdom was completed in\r\n1890. It covers 697 sheets (or 488 of a \"new series\" in large sheets),\r\nand is published in three editions, viz. (a) in outline, with contours\r\nin black, (b) with hills hachured in brown or black, and (c) printed in\r\nfive colours. Carefully revised editions of these and of the other maps\r\nare brought out at intervals of 15 years at most. Since 1898 the\r\ndepartment has also published maps on a smaller scale, viz. a map of\r\nEngland and Wales, on a scale of 2 m. to 1 in., in two editions, both\r\nprinted in colour, the one with hills stippled in brown, the other\r\ncoloured on the \"layer system\" as a strata-relief map; a map of the\r\nUnited Kingdom on a scale of 4 m. to 1 in., also in two editions, the\r\none in outline, showing five classes of roads and parish boundaries, the\r\nother in colours, with stippled hills; a map on a scale of 10 m. to 1\r\nin., also in two editions, and finally a map of the United Kingdom on a\r\nscale of 1:1,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe geological surveys of Great Britain and Ireland were connected from\r\n1832 to 1853 with the ordnance survey, but are now carried on\r\nindependently. The ordnance survey, too, no longer depends on the war\r\noffice but upon the board of agriculture and fisheries. A _Bathymetrical\r\nSurvey of the Freshwater Lochs of Scotland_, under the direction of Sir\r\nJohn Murray and L. Pullar, was completed in 1908, and the results\r\npublished by the Royal Geographical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n  France.\r\n\r\nProposals for a new map of France, to replace the famous Cassini map of\r\n1744-1793 were made in 1802 and again by R. Bonne in 1808, but owing to\r\nthe wars then devastating Europe no steps were taken until 1817, and the\r\n_Carte de France de l'état major_ on a scale of 1:80,000 was only\r\ncompleted in 1880. It is engraved on copper. The hachured hills are\r\nbased upon contours, and are of admirable commensurability. It has\r\nserved as a basis for a _Carte de la France_, published by the Service\r\nVicinal on a scale of 1:100,000, in 596 sheets, and of a general map\r\nprepared by the ministère des travaux publics on a scale of 1:200,000 in\r\n80 sheets. On both these maps the hills are printed in grey chalk. A\r\nthird topographical map of France is being published in accordance with\r\nthe recommendation of a committee presided over by General de la Noix in\r\n1897. The surveys for this map were begun in 1905. The maps are based\r\nupon the cadastral plans (1:1000), thoroughly revised and connected with\r\nthe triangulation of France and furnished with contours at intervals of\r\n5 m. by precise measurement. These _minutes_ are published on a scale of\r\n1:10,000 or 1:20,000 for mountain districts, while the scale of the\r\ngeneral map is 1:50,000. Each sheet is bounded by parallels and\r\nmeridians. The hills are shown in brown contours at intervals of 10 m.\r\nand grey shading in chalk (Berthaut, _La Carte de France, 1750-1898_;\r\nParis, 1899). A geological map of France on a scale of 1:80,000 is\r\nnearly completed, there are also a map (1:500,000) by Carez and Vasseur,\r\nand an official _Carte géologique_ (1:1,000,000; 1906).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Germany.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the 19th century topographical maps of the various\r\nGerman states had been completed, and in several instances surveys of a\r\nmore exact nature had been completed or begun, when in 1878 the\r\ngovernments of Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria and Württemberg agreed to\r\nsupersede local maps by publishing a map of the empire (_Reichskarte_)\r\nin 674 sheets on a scale of 1:100,000. The earlier sheets of this\r\nexcellent map were lithographed, but these are gradually being\r\nsuperseded by maps engraved on copper. Colour-printing is employed\r\nsince 1901. The hills are hachured and in some instances contours at\r\nintervals of 50 metres are introduced. The map was completed in 1909,\r\nbut is continually undergoing renewal. The _Messtischblätter_, called\r\n_Positionsblätter_ in Bavaria, are on a scale of 1:25,000. The older\r\namong them leave much to be desired, but those of a later date are\r\nsatisfactory. This applies more especially to the maps of Saxony (since\r\n1879) and Württemberg (since 1893). The features of the ground on most\r\nof these maps are shown by contours at intervals of 10 metres. The map\r\nproduced on this large scale numbers over 5000 sheets, and is used as a\r\nbasis for the geological surveys carried on in several of the states of\r\nGermany. A general map of the German Empire (_Uebersichtskarte_) on a\r\nscale of 1:200,000, in 196 sheets, is in progress since 1893. It is\r\nprinted in three colours, and gives contours at intervals of 10 metres.\r\nIn addition to these maps there are D. G. Reymann's well-known\r\n_Specialkarte von Mittel Europa_ (1:200,000), acquired by the Prussian\r\ngovernment in 1874 (it will ultimately consist of 796 sheets), a\r\ngovernment and Liebenow's map of central Europe (1:300,000) and C.\r\nVogel's beautiful map of Germany (1:500,000).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe _Specialkarte_ of Austria-Hungary on a scale of 1:75,000 (765\r\nsheets), based upon a triangulation and cadastral surveys (1816-1867),\r\nwas completed in 1889, and published in heliogravure. This map was\r\nrepeatedly revised, but as it no longer met modern requirements as to\r\naccuracy the director of the military geographical establishment at\r\nVienna, Field Marshal Chr. von Steeb, in 1896, organized what\r\npractically amounts to a re-survey of the entire monarchy, to be\r\ncompleted in 75 years. At the same time the cadastral plans, reduced to\r\na scale of 1:25,000, are being published in photo-lithography. A general\r\nmap of central Europe in 283 sheets published by the Austrian government\r\n(1:200,000) includes nearly the whole of the Balkan Peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe famous map of Switzerland, with which is associated the name of\r\nGeneral H. Dufour (d. 1875), is based upon a triangulation (1809-1833)\r\nand surveys on a scale of 1:25,000 for the lowlands, 1:50,000 for the\r\nalpine districts, and was published (1842-1865) on a scale of 1:100,000.\r\nThe hills are hachured, the light, in the case of the loftier regions,\r\nbeing supposed to fall obliquely. The original surveys, carefully\r\nrevised, have been published since 1870 as a _Topographical Atlas of\r\nSwitzerland_--the so-called _Siegfried Atlas_, in 552 sheets. They are\r\nprinted in three colours, contours at intervals of 10 and 20 metres\r\nbeing in brown, incidental features (ravines, cliffs, glaciers) in black\r\nor blue. To mountain-climbers these contour maps are invaluable, but for\r\nordinary purposes \"strata maps,\" such as J. M. Ziegler's hypsometric\r\nmaps (1856) or so-called \"relief maps,\" which attempt to delineate the\r\nground so as to give the impression of a relief, are generally\r\npreferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Belgium.\r\n\r\nThe new survey of Belgium was completed in 1872 and there have been\r\npublished 527 plane-table sections or _planchettes_ on a scale of\r\n1:20,000 (1866-1880), a \"Carte topographique de la Belgique,\" in 72\r\nsheets, on a scale of 1:40,000 (1861-1883), and a more recent map in 26\r\nsheets on a scale of 1:100,000 (1903-1912). The last is printed in five\r\ncolours, the ground is shown in contours of 10 metres interval and grey\r\nstippling.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Holland.\r\n\r\nThe new survey of the Netherlands, based upon General Krayenhoff's\r\nprimary triangulation (1802-1811) was completed in 1855. The results\r\nhave been published on a scale of 1:25,000 (776 sheets, since 1866),\r\n1:50,000 (Topographic and Military Map, 62 sheets, 1850-1864, and a\r\nWaterstaatskaart, 1864-1892), and 1:200,000 (Topographical Atlas, 21\r\nsheets, 1868-1871).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Denmark.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark, on the proposal of the Academy of Science, a survey was\r\ncarried out in 1766-1825, but the maps issued by the Danish general\r\nstaff depend upon more recent surveys. These include plane-table\r\nsections (_Maalebordsblade_), 1209 sheets on a scale of 1:20,000, with\r\ncontours at intervals of 5 to 10 ft., published since 1830; _Atlasblade_\r\nof Jutland and of _De Danske Öer_, on a scale of 1:40,000, the former\r\nin 131 sheets, since 1870, the latter, on the same scale, in 94 sheets,\r\nsince 1890, and still in progress, and a general staff map on a scale of\r\n1:100,000, in 68 sheets, since 1890. Maps of the Faroer and of Iceland\r\nhave likewise been issued.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Scandinavia.\r\n\r\nModern surveys in Sweden date from the organization of a corps of\r\n\"Landemätare,\" known since 1874 as a topographical department of the\r\ngeneral staff. The maps issued by this authority include one of southern\r\nSweden, 1:100,000, another of northern Sweden, 1:200,000, and a general\r\nmap on a scale of 1:1,000,000. In Norway a geographical survey\r\n(_Opmaaling_) has been in progress since 1783, but the topographical map\r\nof the kingdom on a scale of 1:100,000 in 340 sheets, has not yet been\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Russia.\r\n\r\nOf Russia in Europe only the more densely peopled governments have been\r\nsurveyed, since 1816, in the manner of other European countries, while\r\nfor most regions there are only so-called \"military surveys.\" The most\r\nreadily available map of the whole country is the 10-verst map\r\n(1:420,000), known as General J. A. Strelbitzki's, and published\r\n1865-1880. A topographic map (1:126,000) embracing the whole of western\r\nRussia, with Poland and the country of the Don Cossacks, is designed to\r\nbe extended over the whole empire. Certain governments--Moscow, Kief,\r\nVolhynia, Bessarabia, the Crimea, &c.--have been published on a scale of\r\n1:24,000, while Finland, as far as 61° N., was re-surveyed in 1870-1895,\r\nand a map on a scale of 1:42,000 is approaching completion.\r\n\r\nSurveys in Asiatic Russia are conducted by the topographical departments\r\norganized at Orenburg, Tashkent, Omsk, Irkutsk and Tiflis. To the latter\r\nwe are indebted for a valuable map of Caucasia, 1:210,000, which since\r\nthe first publication (1863-1885) has undergone careful revision. The\r\nSiberian departments have published a number of maps on a scale of\r\n1:420,000. In addition to these the survey for the Trans-Siberian\r\nrailway has been published on a scale of 1:630,000, as also maps of the\r\nRusso-Chinese frontier districts, 1:210,000 and 1:1,168,000. A map of\r\nAsiatic Russia, 1:420,000, by Bolshef, in 192 sheets, is in course of\r\npublication.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Portugal and Spain.\r\n\r\nPassing to southern Europe we find that Portugal has completed a _Charta\r\nchorographica_ (1:100,000) since 1856. In Spain a plane-table survey on\r\na scale of 1:20,000 has been in progress since 1870, but of the map of\r\nSpain in 1078 sheets on a scale of 1:50,000 only 150 had been issued by\r\nthe depósito de la guerra up to 1910. Meanwhile reference may be made to\r\nB. F. Coello's _Atlas de la España_ (1848-1890), the maps of which are\r\non a scale of 1:200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italy.\r\n\r\nIn Italy _Tavulette rilevata_ on a scale of 1:25,000 or 1:50,000, with\r\ncontours, based on surveys made 1862-1890, are being published, and a\r\n_Carta del regno d'Italia_, 1:100,000, is practically complete. There\r\nare a _Carta idrologica_ and a _Carta geologica_ on the same scale, and\r\na _Carta orografica_ on a scale of 1:500,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Greece.\r\n\r\nGreece is still dependent upon foreigners for its maps, among which the\r\n_Carte de Grèce_ (1:200,000) from rapid surveys made by General Palet in\r\n1828, was published in a new edition in 1880. A similar map, mainly\r\nbased upon surveys made by Austrian officers and revised by H. Kiepert\r\n(1:300,000), was published by the Military Geographical Institute of\r\nVienna in 1885. Far superior to these maps is the _Karte von Attika_\r\n(1:100,000 and 1:25,000) based upon careful surveys made by Prussian\r\nofficers and published by E. Curtius and J. H. Kaupert on behalf of the\r\nGerman Archaeological Institute in Athens (1878), or A. Philippson's map\r\nof the Peloponnese (1:300,000; 1901).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balkan States.\r\n\r\nFor maps of the Balkan Peninsula we are still largely indebted to the\r\nrapid surveys carried on by Austrian and Russian officers. The Austrian\r\nmap of central Europe embraces the whole of the Balkan Peninsula on a\r\nscale of 1:200,000; the Russian surveys (1877-1879) are embodied in a\r\nmap of the eastern part of the Balkan on a scale 1:126,000, and a map\r\nof Bulgaria and southern Rumelia, on a scale 1:200,000, both published\r\nin 1883. A map of Turkey in Europe, scale 1:210,000, was published by\r\nthe Turkish general staff (1899), and another map, scale 1:250,000, by\r\nthe intelligence division of the British war office is in progress since\r\n1906. Bosnia and Herzegovina are now included with the surveys of the\r\nAustrian Empire, the kingdom of Servia has been surveyed (1880-1891) and\r\nthe results published on a scale of 1:75,000; in eastern Rumania surveys\r\nhave been in progress since 1874 and the results have been published on\r\na scale of 1:50,000; a general map of the entire kingdom, scale\r\n1:200,000, was published in 1906-1907; a map of Montenegro (1:75,000),\r\nbased on surveys by Austrian and Russian officers, was published at\r\nVienna in 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Asia.\r\n\r\nIn Asiatic Turkey several districts of historical interest have been\r\nsurveyed, and surveys have likewise been made in the interest of\r\nrailways, or by boundary commissions, but there is no such thing as a\r\ngeneral survey carried on under the direction of government. We are\r\nthus, to a large extent, still dependent upon compilations, such as R.\r\nKiepert's _Asia Minor_ (1:400,000; 1904-1908), a map of eastern Turkey\r\nin Asia, Syria and western Persia (1:2,000,000; 1910), published by the\r\nRoyal Geographical Society, or a Russian general map (1:630,000,\r\npublished 1880-1885). Among maps based upon actual surveys those of\r\nPalestine, by Lieutenant G. R. Conder and H. H. (afterwards Lord)\r\nKitchener (1:63,360, 1880), of the Sinai Peninsula by Sir C. W. Wilson\r\nand H. S. Palmer (1:126,730, 1870), of Arabia Petraea by Dr A. Musil\r\n(1:300,000, 1907) or of the Aden territory (1905) are among the more\r\ninteresting. Of Cyprus an excellent map from surveys by Major (Lord) H.\r\nH. Kitchener was published in 1884 (1:63,360).\r\n\r\nIn the case of Persia and Afghanistan we are still dependent upon\r\ncompilations such as a Russian staff map (1:840,000, published in 1886),\r\nColonel Sir T. H. Holdich's map of Persia (1:1,014,000, Simla,\r\n1897-1899), or a smaller map (1:2,028,000 and 1:4,056,000), published by\r\nthe geographical division of the general staff. The settlement of\r\nboundaries in northern Afghanistan (1883) and in Seistan (1870) has\r\nnecessitated surveys of some interest.\r\n\r\nA trigonometrical survey of British India was begun in 1800 and the\r\ncountry can now boast of a survey which in most respects is equal to\r\nthose of most European states. The surveys are made on scales varying\r\naccording to the necessities of the case or the nature of the country,\r\nand they have been extended since 1862 beyond the boundaries of India\r\nproper. Revenue surveys for land settlement are published on a scale of\r\n1:4000, but the usual scale for topographical maps is 1:63,360. An\r\n_Indian Atlas_, on a scale of 1:255,660, includes also Ceylon and the\r\nMalay Peninsula, but although begun so long ago as 1827 many of its\r\nsheets are unpublished. There are in addition an official map of India\r\n(1:1,000,000), the first edition of which was published in 1903, as also\r\nmaps of the great provinces of India, including Burma, all on a scale of\r\n1:2,827,520, and a variety of physical and statistical maps. Ceylon and\r\nthe Straits Settlements, with the Federal Malay States, have their own\r\nsurveyors-general. The British North Borneo Company published a _Map of\r\nBritish North Borneo_, on a scale of 1:633,600 (1905).\r\n\r\nIn Siam a regular survey was organized by Mr J. McCarthy (1881-1883), a\r\nformer official of the Indian survey, which did good work in connexion\r\nwith the determination of the Franco-Siamese frontier (1906). The\r\nsurveys are made on the scales of 1:4000, 1:31,680 and 1:63,360.\r\n\r\nIn French Indo-China surveys have been in progress since 1881. The\r\nBureau of the Indo-Chinese general staff, has published a map of\r\nIndo-China, including Cambodia, in 45 sheets (1:200,000, 1895), while to\r\nthe service géographique de l'Indo-Chine, organized in 1899, we owe a\r\n_Carte de l'Indo-Chine_ (1:500,000).\r\n\r\nFor China we are still largely dependent upon careful compilations like\r\nBaron F. von Richthofen's _Atlas von China_ (1:750,000, Berlin,\r\n1885-1890) or Bretschneider's _Map of China_ (1:4,600,000) a new edition\r\nof which appeared at St Petersburg in 1900. There are good survey maps\r\nof the British colony of Hong-Kong, of Wei-hai-Wei and of the country\r\naround Kiao-chou, and the establishment of topographical offices at\r\nPeking and Ngan-king holds out some promise of native surveys. In the\r\nmeantime large scale maps prepared by European authorities are to be\r\nwelcomed, such as maps of Chih-li and Shan-tung (1:200,000), from\r\nsurveys by Prussian officers, 1901-1905, maps on East China\r\n(1:1,000,000) and of Yun-nan by British, German and Indian officers, of\r\nthe Indo-Chinese frontier (1:200,000, Paris 1908), and of the upper\r\nYangtsze-kiang by S. Chevalier (Shanghai, 1900).\r\n\r\nJapan has a regular survey department originated by Europeans and\r\nsuccessfully carried on by natives. The primary triangulation was\r\ncompleted in 1880, a topographical map coloured geologically (1:200,000)\r\nwas published 1889-1897, and in addition to this there are being\r\npublished an agronomical map on a scale of 1:100,000 (since 1887) and\r\nothers. The Japanese government has likewise published a map of Korea\r\n(1:1,000,000; 1898).\r\n\r\nThe Philippine Islands are represented in a carefully compiled map by C.\r\nW. Hodgson (1:1,115,000, New York, 1908). Of Java we possess an\r\nexcellent topographical map based upon surveys made 1850-1887\r\n(1:100,000). A similar map has been in progress for Sumatra since 1883,\r\nwhile the maps for the remaining Dutch Indies are still based, almost\r\nexclusively, upon flying surveys. For general purposes the _Atlas der\r\nNederlandsche Bezittingen in Oost-Indie_ by J. N. Stemfoort and J. J.\r\nTen Siethoff, of which a new edition has been published since 1900, may\r\nbe consulted with confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Africa.\r\n\r\nIn Africa nearly all the international boundaries have been carefully\r\nsurveyed and marked on the ground, since 1880, and yield a good basis as\r\na guide for the map compiler. A general map of Africa, by Colonel Lannoy\r\nde Bissy, on a scale of 1:2,000,000 was first published in 1882-1888,\r\nbut is carefully revised from time to time. The geographical section of\r\nthe British general staff is publishing maps of all Africa on scales of\r\n1:250,000 and 1:1,000,000. In Egypt excellent work has been done by a\r\nsurvey department organized and directed by Captain H. G. Lyons up to\r\n1909. It has published a topographical map of the Nile valley\r\n(1:50,000), an irrigation map (1:100,000), a general map (1:250,000),\r\nnumerous cadastral plans, &c. Work on similar lines is carried on in the\r\nAnglo-Egyptian Sudan. Algeria has been in course of survey since 1868,\r\nTunis since 1878, and the results have been published on scales of\r\n1:50,000 and 1:250,000. Of Morocco there are many maps, among which\r\nseveral compiled by the French service géographique de l'armée,\r\nincluding a _Carte du Maroc_ (1:200,000), in progress since 1909. In the\r\nBritish colonies of tropical and of South Africa[26] surveys for the\r\nmost part are carried on actively. Of the Gambia Colony there is a map\r\nby Major E. L. Cowie (1:250,000, 1904-1905); the survey of the Gold\r\nCoast Colony is being published by Major F. G. Guggisberg since 1907\r\n(1:125,000 and 1:200,000); southern and northern Nigeria are adequately\r\nrepresented on the maps of the general staff (1:250,000). The states of\r\nBritish South Africa have each their surveyor-general, and a\r\nreconnaissance survey has been in progress since 1903. It is based upon\r\na careful triangulation, superintended by Sir D. Gill, and carried in\r\n1907 within 70 m. of Lake Tanganyika. This survey is rapidly superseding\r\nother maps, such as the surveyor-general's map of Cape Colony\r\n(1:127,000); A. Duncan's map of the Orange River State (1:148,705;\r\n1902-1904) and Jeppe's map of the Transvaal (1:476,000; 1899). The\r\nresults of a survey of southern Rhodesia are given on the map of the\r\nBritish general staff (1:500,000; 1909), while of north-eastern Rhodesia\r\nwe have an excellent map compiled by C. L. Beringer in 1907\r\n(1:1,000,000). Surveys in British Central Africa were taken up in 1894;\r\na survey of Lake Nyasa, by Lieut. E. L. Rhoades and W. B. Phillips, was\r\npublished in 1902. As regards British East Africa and Uganda, the\r\nsurveys in the latter (on scales of 1:10,000 and 1:125,000) have made\r\nconsiderable progress. The Victoria Nyanza was surveyed by Captain B.\r\nWhitehouse (1898-1900), and the results have been published on a scale\r\nof 1:292,000. These British possessions, together with the whole of\r\nSomaliland and southern Abyssinia, are satisfactorily represented on the\r\nmaps of the British general staff.\r\n\r\nMaps of the French Africa Colonies have been published by the service\r\ngéographique de l'Afrique occidental and the service géographique des\r\ncolonies. A map of Senegal (1:100,000) is in progress since 1905. The\r\nofficial maps of the other colonies have been compiled by A. Meunier\r\nbetween 1902 and 1909. They include French West Africa, (1:2,000,000;\r\n2nd ed., 1908), French Guinea (1:500,000; 1902) and the Ivory Coast and\r\nDahomey (1:1,500,000; 1907-1908). A map of the French Congo by J. Hansen\r\n(1:1,500,000), was published in 1907. In Madagascar a topographical\r\nbureau was established by General J. S. Gallieni in 1896, and the\r\nsurveys are being published since 1900 on a scale of 1:100,000.\r\n\r\nAs regards the German colonies we are dependent upon compilations by R.\r\nKiepert, P. Sprigade and M. Moisel. Good maps of the Portuguese colonies\r\nare to be found in an _Atlas colonial Portugues_, a second edition of\r\nwhich was published by the Commissão de Cartographia in 1909. Of the\r\nCongo State we have an official map on a scale of 1:1,000,000, published\r\nin 1907. Of Italian Eritrea we have excellent maps on various scales of\r\n1:100,000, 1:200,000 and 1:500,000, based upon surveys made between 1888\r\nand 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Australia.\r\n\r\nIn the states of Australia cadastral surveys conducted by\r\nsurveyors-general have been in progress for many years, as also\r\ntrigonometrical surveys (Western Australia excepted), and the\r\npublication of parish and township or county maps keeps pace with the\r\nsettlement of the country; but with the exception of Victoria none of\r\nthese states is in possession of a topographical map equal in accuracy\r\nto similar maps published in Europe. In Victoria the so-called geodetic\r\nsurvey was begun in 1858; the maps are published on a scale of\r\n1:126,730. There exists also a general map, on a scale of 1:506,930.\r\nMaps on the same scale are available of New South Wales, South Australia\r\nand Tasmania, on a scale of 1:560,000 for Western Australia, on a scale\r\nof 1:253,460 for Queensland. There are likewise maps on smaller scales,\r\nwhich undergo frequent revision. The map of British New Guinea is on a\r\nscale of 1:330,200 (1898). New Zealand has a good general map on a scale\r\nof 1:633,700. A trigonometrical survey was given up and only details of\r\nimmediate practical use are required. The \"Lands Department\" of the Fiji\r\nIslands has published a map on a scale of 1:380,000 (1908).\r\n\r\n\r\n  North America.\r\n\r\nThe cadastral surveys in Canada are carried on by a commission of\r\nCrown-lands in the old provinces and by a Dominion land office, which\r\nlays out townships as in the United States, but with greater accuracy. A\r\nsurveyor-general is attached to the department of the interior, at\r\nOttawa. He publishes the topographical maps (1:63,366) since 1906. They\r\nare based upon theodolite traverses 15 m. apart, and connected with the\r\nUnited States lake and coast surveys, the details being filled in by\r\nplane-table surveys on a scale of 1:31,680. The contours, 25 ft. apart,\r\ndepend upon spirit-levelling. In the Rocky Mountains surveys\r\nphotographic apparatus is successfully employed. The surveyor-general\r\nissues also \"sectional maps\" (1:190,000 and 1:40,000) and so-called\r\n\"Standard\" topographical maps for the thinly peopled west, on scales of\r\n1:250,000 and 1:500,000. He is responsible likewise for maps of Yukon\r\nand of Labrador, supplied by the geological survey, the former on a\r\nscale of 1:380,200, the latter of 1:1,584,000. The intelligence branch\r\nof the Canadian department of military defence is publishing since 1904\r\ntopographical maps on scales of 1:63,366 and 1:126,730, with contours. A\r\ngeodetic survey department, under Dr. W. F. King, chief astronomer of\r\nthe Dominion, was established in 1909.\r\n\r\nMaps of Newfoundland, orographical as well as geological, scale\r\n1:1,584,200, have been published.\r\n\r\nIn the United States a \"geological survey\" was organized in 1879, under\r\nClarence King as director, whose successor, Major J. W. Powell, rightly\r\nconceived that it was necessary to produce good topographical maps\r\nbefore a geological survey could be pursued with advantage. It is under\r\nhis wise guidance that the survey has attained its present efficiency.\r\nIt is based upon a triangulation by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.\r\nThe maps of the more densely peopled parts of the Union are published on\r\na scale of 1:62,500, and those of the remainder of the country on half\r\nor a quarter of that scale. The hills are shown by contours at intervals\r\nof 10 or 100 ft. The details given are considered sufficient to admit of\r\nthe selection of general routes for railways or other public works. The\r\nsurvey progresses at the rate of about 40,000 sq. m. annually, and in\r\ncourse of time it will supersede the map of the separate states, based\r\non older surveys. A \"reconnaissance\" map of Alaska (on a scale of\r\n1:250,000) was published in 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Central America.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico the surveys are in charge of a comision geografica-exploradora\r\nattached to the secretaria de Fomento, but only about 140 sheets of a\r\n_Carta general_ on a scale of 1:100,000 have been published. There are\r\nalso a map of the state of S. Luis Potosi (1:250,000), of the environs\r\nof Puebla (1:50,000) and a _Carta general de la republica mexicana_\r\n(1:250,000).\r\n\r\nA useful map of Central America has been published by the topographical\r\nsection of the British general staff on a scale of 1:170,300. Of great\r\nvalue for cartographical work is a careful survey, carried out by\r\nAmerican engineers (1897-1898), for a continental railway running along\r\nthe west coast from Mexico to Chile. In South America, in proportion to\r\nthe area of the country, only few surveys of a thoroughly scientific\r\nnature have been made, and it is therefore satisfactory that the service\r\ngéographique of the French army should be publishing, since 1900, a map\r\nof the entire continent on a scale of 1:1,000,000.\r\n\r\nColombia is but inadequately represented by rough maps. For Colombia we\r\nhave F. L. Vergara y Velasco's _Atlas de geografia colombiana_\r\n(1906-1908); Ecuador is fairly well represented by Th. Wolf (1892) and\r\nHans Meier (1907); in the case of Peru we still largely depend upon Paz\r\nSoldan's _Atlas geografica_ (1865-1867) and A. Raimondi's _Mapa del\r\nPeru_ (1:500,000) based upon surveys made before 1869. Sir Martin\r\nConway's \"Map of the Andes of La Paz\" (1:600,000; 1900) as well as Major\r\nP. H. Fawcett's survey of the Brazilian boundary (1906-1907) are welcome\r\nadditions to our knowledge of Bolivia. In Chile a comision topografica\r\nwas appointed as long ago as 1848, but the map produced under its\r\nauspices by Professor F. Pissis (1:250,000, 1870-1877), leaves much to\r\nbe desired. Since that time, however, valuable maps have been published\r\nby an _Oficina de mensura de tierras_, by a _seccion de geografia y\r\nminas_ connected with the department of public works, by the _Oficina\r\nhidrografica_, and more especially in connexion with surveys\r\nnecessitated by the boundary disputes with Argentina, which were settled\r\nby arbitration in 1899 and 1902. The surveys which led to the latter\r\nwere conducted by Sir Thomas Holdich.\r\n\r\nIn Venezuela a commission for producing a _plano militar_ or military\r\nmap of the country was appointed by General Castro in 1904, but little\r\nprogress seems to have been made, and meantime we are dependent upon a\r\nrevised edition of A. Codazzi's map of 1840 which was published in 1884.\r\nIn Brazil little or nothing is done by the central government, but the\r\nprogressive states of São Paulo and Mines Gerães have commissãos\r\ngeographicos e geologicos engaged in the production of topographical\r\nmaps. Valuable materials have likewise been acquired by several river\r\nsurveys including those of the Amazonas by Azevedo and Pinto (1862-1864)\r\nand W. Chandless (1862-1869) and of the Rio Madeira by Colonel G. Earl\r\nChurch and Keller-Leuzinger (1860-1875). The proposal of a committee\r\npresided over by the Marshal H. de Beaurepaire-Rohan (1876) to prepare a\r\nmap of Brazil on a scale of 1:200,000 has never been acted upon, and in\r\nthe meantime we are dependent upon works like the _Atlas do imperio do\r\nBrazil_ by Mendes de Almeida (1868) or the maps in our general atlases.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina an official geographical institute was established in 1879,\r\nbut neither A. Seelstrang's _Atlas_ (1886-1892) nor H. Hoskold's _Mapa\r\ntopografica_ (1:2,000,000; London, 1895), which were published by it,\r\nnor any of the numerous provincial maps are based upon scientific\r\nsurveys.\r\n\r\n  It need hardly be said that hydrographic surveys have been of great\r\n  service to compilers of maps. There are few coast-lines, frequented by\r\n  shipping, which have not yet been surveyed in a definite manner. In\r\n  this work the British hydrographic office may justly claim the credit\r\n  of having contributed the chief share. Great Britain has likewise\r\n  taken the lead in those deep-sea explorations which reveal to us the\r\n  configuration of the sea-bottom, and enable us to construct charts of\r\n  the ocean bed corresponding to the contoured maps of dry land yielded\r\n  by topographical surveys.     (E. G. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMAP PROJECTIONS\r\n\r\nIn the construction of maps, one has to consider how a portion of\r\nspherical surface, or a configuration traced on a sphere, can be\r\nrepresented on a plane. If the area to be represented bear a very small\r\nratio to the whole surface of the sphere, the matter is easy: thus, for\r\ninstance, there is no difficulty in making a map of a parish, for in\r\nsuch cases the curvature of the surface does not make itself evident. If\r\nthe district is larger and reaches the size of a county, as Yorkshire\r\nfor instance, then the curvature begins to be sensible, and one requires\r\nto consider how it is to be dealt with. The sphere cannot be opened out\r\ninto a plane like the cone or cylinder; consequently in a plane\r\nrepresentation of configurations on a sphere it is impossible to retain\r\nthe desired proportions of lines or areas or equality of angles. But\r\nthough one cannot fulfil all the requirements of the case, we may fulfil\r\nsome by sacrificing others; we may, for instance, have in the\r\nrepresentation exact similarity to all very small portions of the\r\noriginal, but at the expense of the areas, which will be quite\r\nmisrepresented. Or we may retain equality of areas if we give up the\r\nidea of similarity. It is therefore usual, excepting in special cases,\r\nto steer a middle course, and, by making compromises, endeavour to\r\nobtain a representation which shall not involve large errors of scale.\r\n\r\nA globe gives a perfect representation of the surface of the earth; but,\r\npractically, the necessary limits to its size make it impossible to\r\nrepresent in this manner the details of countries. A globe of the\r\nordinary dimensions serves scarcely any other purpose than to convey a\r\nclear conception of the earth's surface as a whole, exhibiting the\r\nfigure, extent, position and general features of the continents and\r\nislands, with the intervening oceans and seas; and for this purpose it\r\nis indeed absolutely essential and cannot be replaced by any kind of\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nThe construction of a map virtually resolves itself into the drawing of\r\ntwo sets of lines, one set to represent meridians, the other to\r\nrepresent parallels. These being drawn, the filling in of the outlines\r\nof countries presents no difficulty. The first and most natural idea\r\nthat occurs to one as to the manner of drawing the circles of latitude\r\nand longitude is to draw them according to the laws of perspective.\r\nPerhaps the next idea which would occur would be to derive the meridians\r\nand parallels in some other simple geometrical way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n_Cylindrical Equal Area Projection._--Let us suppose a model of the\r\nearth to be enveloped by a cylinder in such a way that the cylinder\r\ntouches the equator, and let the plane of each parallel such as PR be\r\nprolonged to intersect the cylinder in the circle pr. Now unroll the\r\ncylinder and the projection will appear as in fig. 2. The whole world is\r\nnow represented as a rectangle, each parallel is a straight line, and\r\nits total length is the same as that of the equator, the distance of\r\neach parallel from the equator is sin l (where l is the latitude and the\r\nradius of the model earth is taken as unity). The meridians are parallel\r\nstraight lines spaced at equal distances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThis projection possesses an important property. From the elementary\r\ngeometry of sphere and cylinder it is clear that each strip of the\r\nprojection is _equal in area_ to the zone on the model which it\r\nrepresents, and that each portion of a strip is equal in area to the\r\ncorresponding portion of a zone. Thus, each small four-sided figure (on\r\nthe model) bounded by meridians and parallels [symbol] is represented on\r\nthe projection by a rectangle [symbol] which is of exactly the same\r\narea, and this applies to any such figure however small. It therefore\r\nfollows that any figure, of any shape on the model, is correctly\r\nrepresented as regards area by its corresponding figure on the\r\nprojection. Projections having this property are said to be _equal-area\r\nprojections_ or _equivalent projections_; the name of the projection\r\njust described is \"the cylindrical equal-area projection.\" This\r\nprojection will serve to exemplify the remark made in the first\r\nparagraph that it is possible to select certain qualities of the model\r\nwhich shall be represented truthfully, but only at the expense of other\r\nqualities. For instance, it is clear that in this case all meridian\r\nlengths are too small and all lengths along the parallels, except the\r\nequator, are too large. Thus although the areas are preserved the shapes\r\nare, especially away from the equator, much distorted.\r\n\r\nThe property of preserving areas is, however, a valuable one when the\r\npurpose of the map is to exhibit areas. If, for example, it is desired\r\nto give an idea of the area and distribution of the various states\r\ncomprising the British Empire, this is a fairly good projection.\r\nMercator's, which is commonly used in atlases, preserves local shape at\r\nthe expense of area, and is valueless for the purpose of showing areas.\r\n\r\nMany other projections can be and have been devised, which depend for\r\ntheir construction on a purely geometrical relationship between the\r\nimaginary model and the plane. Thus projections may be drawn which are\r\nderived from cones which touch or cut the sphere, the parallels being\r\nformed by the intersection with the cones of planes parallel to the\r\nequator, or by lines drawn radially from the centre. It is convenient to\r\ndescribe all projections which are derived from the model by a simple\r\nand direct geometrical construction as \"geometrical projections.\" All\r\nother projections may be known as \"non-geometrical projections.\"\r\nGeometrical projections, which include perspective projections, are\r\ngenerally speaking of small practical value. They have loomed much more\r\nlargely on the map-maker's horizon than their importance warrants. It is\r\nnot going too far to say that the expression \"map projection\" conveys to\r\nmost well-informed persons the notion of a geometrical projection; and\r\nyet by far the greater number of useful projections are non-geometrical.\r\nThe notion referred to is no doubt due to the very term \"projection,\"\r\nwhich unfortunately appears to indicate an arrangement of the\r\nterrestrial parallels and meridians which can be arrived at by direct\r\ngeometrical construction. Especially has harm been caused by this idea\r\nwhen dealing with the group of conical projections. The most useful\r\nconical projections have nothing to do with the secant cones, but are\r\nsimply projections in which the meridians are straight lines which\r\nconverge to a point which is the centre of the circular parallels. The\r\nnumber of really useful geometrical projections may be said to be four:\r\nthe _equal-area cylindrical_ just described, and the following\r\nperspective projections--the _central_, the _stereographic_ and\r\n_Clarke's external_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Perspective Projections._\r\n\r\nIn perspective drawings of the sphere, the plane on which the\r\nrepresentation is actually made may generally be any plane perpendicular\r\nto the line joining the centre of the sphere and the point of vision. If\r\nV be the point of vision, P any point on the spherical surface, then p,\r\nthe point in which the straight line VP intersects the plane of the\r\nrepresentation, is the projection of P.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\n_Orthographic Projection._--In this projection the point of vision is at\r\nan infinite distance and the rays consequently parallel; in this case\r\nthe plane of the drawing may be supposed to pass through the centre of\r\nthe sphere. Let the circle (fig. 3) represent the plane of the equator\r\non which we propose to make an orthographic representation of meridians\r\nand parallels. The centre of this circle is clearly the projection of\r\nthe pole, and the parallels are projected into circles having the pole\r\nfor a common centre. The diameters aa´, bb´ being at right angles, let\r\nthe semicircle bab´ be divided into the required number of equal parts;\r\nthe diameters drawn through these points are the projections of\r\nmeridians. The distances of c, of d and of e from the diameter aa´ are\r\nthe radii of the successive circles representing the parallels. It is\r\nclear that, when the points of division are very close, the parallels\r\nwill be very much crowded towards the outside of the map; so much so,\r\nthat this projection is not much used.\r\n\r\n  For an orthographic projection of the globe on a meridian plane let\r\n  qnrs (fig. 4) be the meridian, ns the axis of rotation, then qr is the\r\n  projection of the equator. The parallels will be represented by\r\n  straight lines passing through the points of equal division; these\r\n  lines are, like the equator, perpendicular to ns. The meridians will\r\n  in this case be ellipses described on ns as a common major axis, the\r\n  distances of c, of d and of e from ns being the minor semiaxes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\n  Let us next construct an orthographic projection of the sphere on the\r\n  horizon of any place.\r\n\r\n  Set off the angle aop (fig. 5) from the radius oa, equal to the\r\n  latitude. Drop the perpendicular pP on oa, then P is the projection of\r\n  the pole. On ao produced take ob = pP, then ob is the minor semiaxis\r\n  of the ellipse representing the equator, its major axis being qr at\r\n  right angles to ao. The points in which the meridians meet this\r\n  elliptic equator are determined by lines drawn parallel to aob through\r\n  the points of equal subdivision cdefgh. Take two points, as d and g,\r\n  which are 90° apart, and let ik be their projections on the equator;\r\n  then i is the pole of the meridian which passes through k. This\r\n  meridian is of course an ellipse, and is described with reference to i\r\n  exactly as the equator was described with reference to P. Produce io\r\n  to l, and make lo equal to half the shortest chord that can be drawn\r\n  through i; then lo is the semiaxis of the elliptic meridian, and the\r\n  major axis is the diameter perpendicular to iol.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Orthographic Projection.]\r\n\r\n  For the parallels: let it be required to describe the parallel whose\r\n  co-latitude is u; take pm = pn = u, and let m´n´ be the projections of\r\n  m and n on oPa; then m´n´ is the minor axis of the ellipse\r\n  representing the parallel. Its centre is of course midway between m´\r\n  and n´, and the greater axis is equal to mn. Thus the construction is\r\n  obvious. When pm is less than pa the whole of the ellipse is to be\r\n  drawn. When pm is greater than pa the ellipse touches the circle in\r\n  two points; these points divide the ellipse into two parts, one of\r\n  which, being on the other side of the meridian plane aqr, is\r\n  invisible. Fig. 6 shows the complete orthographic projection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n_Stereographic Projection._--In this case the point of vision is on the\r\nsurface, and the projection is made on the plane of the great circle\r\nwhose pole is V. Let kplV (fig. 7) be a great circle through the point\r\nof vision, and ors the trace of the plane of projection. Let c be the\r\ncentre of a small circle whose radius is cp = cl; the straight line pl\r\nrepresents this small circle in orthographic projection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n  We have first to show that the stereographic projection of the small\r\n  circle pl is itself a circle; that is to say, a straight line through\r\n  V, moving along the circumference of pl, traces a circle on the plane\r\n  of projection ors. This line generates an oblique cone standing on a\r\n  circular base, its axis being cV (since the angle pVc = angle cVl);\r\n  this cone is divided symmetrically by the plane of the great circle\r\n  kpl, and also by the plane which passes through the axis Vc,\r\n  perpendicular to the plane kpl. Now Vr·Vp, being = Vo sec kVp·Vk cos\r\n  kVp = Vo·Vk, is equal to Vs·Vl; therefore the triangles Vrs, Vlp are\r\n  similar, and it follows that the section of the cone by the plane rs\r\n  is similar to the section by the plane pl. But the latter is a circle,\r\n  hence also the projection is a circle; and since the representation of\r\n  every infinitely small circle on the surface is itself a circle, it\r\n  follows that in this projection the representation of small parts is\r\n  strictly similar. Another inference is that the angle in which two\r\n  lines on the sphere intersect is represented by the same angle in the\r\n  projection. This may otherwise be proved by means of fig. 8, where Vok\r\n  is the diameter of the sphere passing through the point of vision, fgh\r\n  the plane of projection, kt a great circle, passing of course through\r\n  V, and ouv the line of intersection of these two planes. A tangent\r\n  plane to the surface at t cuts the plane of projection in the line rvs\r\n  perpendicular to ov; tv is a tangent to the circle kt at t, tr and ts\r\n  are any two tangents to the surface at t. Now the angle vtu (u being\r\n  the projection of t) is 90° - otV = 90° - oVt = ouV = tuv, therefore\r\n  tv is equal to uv; and since tvs and uvs are right angles, it follows\r\n  that the angles vts and vus are equal. Hence the angle rts also is\r\n  equal to its projection rus; that is, any angle formed by two\r\n  intersecting lines on the surface is truly represented in the\r\n  stereographic projection.\r\n\r\nIn this projection, therefore, angles are correctly represented and\r\nevery small triangle is represented by a similar triangle. Projections\r\nhaving this property of similar representation of small parts are called\r\n_orthomorphic_, _conform_ or _conformable_. The word orthomorphic, which\r\nwas introduced by Germain[27] and adopted by Craig,[28] is perhaps the\r\nbest to use.\r\n\r\nSince in orthomorphic projections very small figures are correctly\r\nrepresented, it follows that the scale is the same in all directions\r\nround a point in its immediate neighbourhood, and orthomorphic\r\nprojections may be defined as possessing this property. There are many\r\nother orthomorphic projections, of which the best known is Mercator's.\r\nThese are described below.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the stereographic projection of any circle of the\r\nsphere is itself a circle. But in the case in which the circle to be\r\nprojected passes through V, the projection becomes, for a great circle,\r\na line through the centre of the sphere; otherwise, a line anywhere. It\r\nfollows that meridians and parallels are represented in a projection on\r\nthe horizon of any place by two systems of orthogonally cutting circles,\r\none system passing through two fixed points, namely, the poles; and the\r\nprojected meridians as they pass through the poles show the proper\r\ndifferences of longitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n  To construct a stereographic projection of the sphere on the horizon\r\n  of a given place. Draw the circle vlkr (fig. 9) with the diameters\r\n  kv, lr at right angles; the latter is to represent the central\r\n  meridian. Take koP equal to the co-latitude of the given place, say u;\r\n  draw the diameter PoP¹, and vP, vP´ cutting lr in pp´: these are the\r\n  projections of the poles, through which all the circles representing\r\n  meridians have to pass. All their centres then will be in a line smn\r\n  which crosses pp´ at right angles through its middle point m. Now to\r\n  describe the meridian whose west longitude is [omega], draw pn making\r\n  the angle opn = 90° - [omega], then n is the centre of the required\r\n  circle, whose direction as it passes through p will make an angle opg\r\n  = [omega] with pp´. The lengths of the several lines are\r\n\r\n    op = tan ½u; op´ = cot ½u; om = cot u; mn = cosec u cot [omega].\r\n\r\n  Again, for the parallels, take Pb = Pc equal to the co-latitude, say\r\n  c, of the parallel to be projected; join vb, vc cutting lr in e, d.\r\n  Then ed is the diameter of the circle which is the required\r\n  projection; its centre is of course the middle point of ed, and the\r\n  lengths of the lines are\r\n\r\n    od = tan ½(u - c); oe = tan ½(u + c).\r\n\r\n  The line sn itself is the projection of a parallel, namely, that of\r\n  which the co-latitude c = 180° - u, a parallel which passes through\r\n  the point of vision.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the facility of construction, the stereographic\r\nprojection is not much used in map-making. It is sometimes used for maps\r\nof the hemispheres in atlases, and for star charts.\r\n\r\n_External Perspective Projection._--We now come to the general case in\r\nwhich the point of vision has any position outside the sphere. Let abcd\r\n(fig. 10) be the great circle section of the sphere by a plane passing\r\nthrough c, the central point of the portion of surface to be\r\nrepresented, and V the point of vision. Let pj perpendicular to Vc be\r\nthe plane of representation, join mV cutting pj in f, then f is the\r\nprojection of any point m in the circle abc, and ef is the\r\nrepresentation of cm.\r\n\r\n  Let the angle com = u, Ve = k, Vo = h, ef = [rho]; then, since ef: eV\r\n  = mg:gV, we have [rho] = k sin u/(h + cos u), which gives the law\r\n  connecting a spherical distance u with its rectilinear representation\r\n  [rho]. The relative scale at any point in this system of projection is\r\n  given by\r\n\r\n    [sigma] = d[rho]/du, [sigma]´ = [rho]/sin u,\r\n    [sigma] = k(1 + h cos u)/(h + cos u)²; [sigma]´ = k/(h + cos u),\r\n\r\n  the former applying to measurements made in a direction which passes\r\n  through the centre of the map, the latter to the transverse direction.\r\n  The product [sigma][sigma]´ gives the exaggeration of areas. With\r\n  respect to the alteration of angles we have [Sigma] = (h + cos u)/(l +\r\n  kcos u), and the greatest alteration of angle is\r\n\r\n                /h - 1       u \\\r\n    = sin^(-1) ( ----- tan² --- ).\r\n                \\h + 1       2 /\r\n\r\n  This vanishes when h = 1, that is if the projection be stereographic;\r\n  or for u = 0, that is at the centre of the map. At a distance of 90°\r\n  from the centre, the greatest alteration is 90° - 2 cot^(-1) [root]h.\r\n  (See _Phil. Mag._ 1862.)\r\n\r\n  _Clarke's Projection._--The constants h and k can be determined, so\r\n  that the total misrepresentation, viz.:\r\n         _\r\n        / [beta]\r\n    M = |      {([sigma] - 1)² + ([sigma]´ - 1)²} sin u du,\r\n       _/ 0\r\n\r\n  shall be a minimum, [beta] being the greatest value of u, or the\r\n  spherical radius of the map. On substituting the expressions for\r\n  [sigma] and [sigma]´ the integration is effected without difficulty.\r\n  Put\r\n\r\n    [lambda] = (1 - cos [beta])/(h + cos [beta]); [nu] = (h - 1)[lambda],\r\n\r\n    H = [nu] - (h + 1) log_e ([lambda] + 1), H´ = [lambda](2 - [nu] + (1/3)[nu]²)/(h + 1).\r\n\r\n  Then the value of M is\r\n\r\n    M = 4 sin² ½[beta] + 2kH + k²H´.\r\n\r\n  When this is a minimum,\r\n\r\n    dM/dh = 0; dM/dk = 0\r\n\r\n    :. kH´ + H = 0; 2 dH/dh + k dh H´/dh = 0.\r\n\r\n  Therefore M = 4 sin² ½[beta] - H²/H^1, and h must be determined so as\r\n  to make H²:H´ a maximum. In any particular case this maximum can only\r\n  be ascertained by trial, that is to say, log H² - log H´ must be\r\n  calculated for certain equidistant values of h, and then the\r\n  particular value of h which corresponds to the required maximum can\r\n  be obtained by interpolation. Thus we find that if it be required to\r\n  make the best possible perspective representation of a hemisphere, the\r\n  values of h and k are h = 1.47 and k = 2.034; so that in this case\r\n\r\n             2.034 sin u\r\n    [rho] = ------------.\r\n            1.47 + cos u\r\n\r\n  For a map of Africa or South America, the limiting radius [beta] we\r\n  may take as 40°; then in this case\r\n\r\n            2.543 sin u\r\n   [rho] = -------------.\r\n           1.625 + cos u\r\n\r\n  For Asia, [beta] = 54, and the distance h of the point of sight in\r\n  this case is 1.61. Fig. 11 is a map of Asia having the meridians and\r\n  parallels laid down on this system.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 12 is a perspective representation of more than a hemisphere, the\r\n  radius [beta] being 108°, and the distance h of the point of vision,\r\n  1.40.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Twilight Projection. Clarke's Perspective\r\n  Projection for a Spherical Radius of 108°.]\r\n\r\n  The co-ordinates xy of any point in this perspective may be expressed\r\n  in terms of latitude and longitude of the corresponding point on the\r\n  sphere in the following manner. The co-ordinates originating at the\r\n  centre take the central meridian for the axis of y and a line\r\n  perpendicular to it for the axis of x. Let the latitude of the point\r\n  G, which is to occupy the centre of the map, be [gamma]; if [phi],\r\n  [omega] be the latitude and longitude of any point P (the longitude\r\n  being reckoned from the meridian of G), u the distance PG, and [mu]\r\n  the azimuth of P at G, then the spherical triangle whose sides are 90°\r\n  - [gamma], 90° - [phi], and u gives these relations--\r\n\r\n    sin u sin [mu] = cos [phi] sin [omega],\r\n    sin u cos [mu] = cos [gamma] sin [phi] - sin [gamma] cos [phi] cos [omega],\r\n    cos u          = sin [gamma] sin [phi] + cos [gamma] cos [phi] cos [omega].\r\n\r\n  Now x = [rho] sin [mu], y = [rho] cos [mu], that is,\r\n\r\n     x                       cos [phi] sin [omega]\r\n    --- = -------------------------------------------------------------,\r\n     k    h + sin [gamma] sin [phi] + cos [gamma] cos [phi] cos [omega]\r\n\r\n     y      cos [gamma] sin [phi] - sin [gamma] cos [phi] cos [omega]\r\n    --- = -------------------------------------------------------------,\r\n     k    h + sin [gamma] sin [phi] + cos [gamma] cos [phi] cos [omega]\r\n\r\n  by which x and y can be computed for any point of the sphere. If from\r\n  these equations we eliminate [omega], we get the equation to the\r\n  parallel whose latitude is [phi]; it is an ellipse whose centre is in\r\n  the central meridian, and its greater axis perpendicular to the same.\r\n  The radius of curvature of this ellipse at its intersection with the\r\n  centre meridian is k cos [phi] / (h sin [gamma] + sin [phi]).\r\n\r\n  The elimination of [phi] between x and y gives the equation of the\r\n  meridian whose longitude is [omega], which also is an ellipse whose\r\n  centre and axes may be determined.\r\n\r\n  The following table contains the computed co-ordinates for a map of\r\n  Africa, which is included between latitudes 40° north and 40° south\r\n  and 40° of longitude east and west of a central meridian.\r\n\r\n    +-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    |     |                              Values of x and y.                              |\r\n    |[phi]+--------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n    |     | [omega] = 0° | [omega] = 10° | [omega] = 20° | [omega] = 30° | [omega] = 40° |\r\n    +-----+--------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n    |  0° |  x =  0.00   |      9.69     |     19.43     |     29.25     |     39.17     |\r\n    |     |  y =  0.00   |      0.00     |      0.00     |      0.00     |      0.00     |\r\n    |     |              |               |               |               |               |\r\n    | 10° |  x =  0.00   |      9.60     |     19.24     |     28.95     |     38.76     |\r\n    |     |  y =  9.69   |      9.75     |      9.92     |     10.21     |     10.63     |\r\n    |     |              |               |               |               |               |\r\n    | 20° |  x =  0.00   |      9.32     |     18.67     |     28.07     |     37.53     |\r\n    |     |  y = 19.43   |     19.54     |     19.87     |     20.43     |     21.25     |\r\n    |     |              |               |               |               |               |\r\n    | 30° |  x =  0.00   |      8.84     |     17.70     |     26.56     |     35.44     |\r\n    |     |  y = 29.25   |     29.40     |     29.87     |     30.67     |     31.83     |\r\n    |     |              |               |               |               |               |\r\n    | 40° |  x =  0.00   |      8.15     |     16.28     |     24.39     |     32.44     |\r\n    |     |  y = 39.17   |     39.36     |     39.94     |     40.93     |     42.34     |\r\n    +-----+--------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n_Central or Gnomonic (Perspective) Projection._--In this projection the\r\neye is imagined to be at the centre of the sphere. It is evident that,\r\nsince the planes of all great circles of the sphere pass through the\r\ncentre, the representations of all great circles on this projection will\r\nbe straight lines, and this is the special property of the _central\r\nprojection_, that any great circle (i.e. shortest line on the spherical\r\nsurface) is represented by a straight line. The plane of projection may\r\nbe either parallel to the plane of the equator, in which case the\r\nparallels are represented by concentric circles and the meridians by\r\nstraight lines radiating from the common centre; or the plane of\r\nprojection may be parallel to the plane of some meridian, in which case\r\nthe meridians are parallel straight lines and the parallels are\r\nhyperbolas; or the plane of projection may be inclined to the axis of\r\nthe sphere at any angle [lambda].\r\n\r\n  In the latter case, which is the most general, if [theta] is the angle\r\n  any meridian makes (on paper) with the central meridian, [alpha] the\r\n  longitude of any point P with reference to the central meridian, l the\r\n  latitude of P, then it is clear that the central meridian is a\r\n  straight line at right angles to the equator, which is also a straight\r\n  line, also tan [theta] = sin [lambda] tan [alpha], and the distance of\r\n  p, the projection of P, from the equator along its meridian is (on\r\n  paper) m sec [alpha] sin l / sin (l + x), where tan x = cot [lambda]\r\n  cos [alpha], and m is a constant which defines the scale.\r\n\r\nThe three varieties of the central projection are, as is the case with\r\nother perspective projections, known as polar, meridian or horizontal,\r\naccording to the inclination of the plane of projection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From _Text Book of Topographical Surveying_, by\r\npermission of the Controller of H. M. Stationery Office.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 14.--Part of the Atlantic Ocean on a Meridian Central Projection.\r\nThe shortest path between any two points is shown on this projection by\r\na straight line.]\r\n\r\nFig. 14 is an example of a _meridian central projection_ of part of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. The term \"gnomonic\" was applied to this projection\r\nbecause the projection of the meridians is a similar problem to that of\r\nthe graduation of a sun-dial. It is, however, better to use the term\r\n\"central,\" which explains itself. The central projection is useful for\r\nthe study of direct routes by sea and land. The United States\r\nHydrographic Department has published some charts on this projection.\r\nFalse notions of the direction of shortest lines, which are engendered\r\nby a study of maps on Mercator's projection, may be corrected by an\r\ninspection of maps drawn on the central projection.\r\n\r\nThere is no projection which accurately possesses the property of\r\nshowing shortest paths by straight lines when applied to the spheroid;\r\none which very nearly does so is that which results from the\r\nintersection of terrestrial normals with a plane.\r\n\r\nWe have briefly reviewed the most important projections which are\r\nderived from the sphere by direct geometrical construction, and we pass\r\nto that more important branch of the subject which deals with\r\nprojections which are not subject to this limitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conical Projections._\r\n\r\nConical projections are those in which the parallels are represented by\r\nconcentric circles and the meridians by equally spaced radii. There is\r\nno necessary connexion between a conical projection and any touching or\r\nsecant cone. Projections for instance which are derived by geometrical\r\nconstruction from secant cones are very poor projections, exhibiting\r\nlarge errors, and they will not be discussed. The name conical is given\r\nto the group embraced by the above definition, because, as is obvious, a\r\nprojection so drawn can be bent round to form a cone. The simplest and,\r\nat the same time, one of the most useful forms of conical projection is\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n_Conical Projection with Rectified Meridians and Two Standard\r\nParallels._--In some books this has been, most unfortunately, termed the\r\n\"secant conical,\" on account of the fact that there are two parallels of\r\nthe correct length. The use of this term in the past has caused much\r\nconfusion. Two selected parallels are represented by concentric circular\r\narcs of their true lengths; the meridians are their radii. The degrees\r\nalong the meridians are represented by their true lengths; and the other\r\nparallels are circular arcs through points so determined and are\r\nconcentric with the chosen parallels.\r\n\r\n  Thus in fig. 15 two parallels Gn and G´n´ are represented by their\r\n  true lengths on the sphere; all the distances along the meridian PGG´,\r\n  pnn´ are the true spherical lengths rectified.\r\n\r\n  Let [gamma] be the co-latitude of Gn; [gamma]´ that of Gn´; [omega] be\r\n  the true difference of longitude of PGG´ and pnn´; h[omega] be the\r\n  angle at O; and OP = z, where Pp is the representation of the pole.\r\n  Then the true length of parallel Gn on the sphere is [omega] sin\r\n  [gamma], and this is equal to the length on the projection, i.e.\r\n  [omega] sin [gamma] = h[omega](z + [gamma]); similarly [omega] sin\r\n  [gamma]´= h[omega](z + [gamma]´).\r\n\r\n  The radius of the sphere is assumed to be unity, and z and [gamma] are\r\n  expressed in circular measure. Hence h = sin [gamma]/(z + [gamma]) =\r\n  sin [gamma]´(z + [gamma]´); from this h and z are easily found.\r\n\r\nIn the above description it has been assumed that the two errorless\r\nparallels have been _selected_. But it is usually desirable to impose\r\nsome condition which itself will fix the errorless parallels. There are\r\nmany conditions, any one of which may be imposed. In fig. 15 let Cm and\r\nC´m´ represent the extreme parallels of the map, and let the\r\nco-latitudes of these parallels be c and c´, then any one of the\r\nfollowing conditions may be fulfilled:--\r\n\r\n(a) The errors of scale of the extreme parallels may be made equal and\r\nmay be equated to the error of scale of the parallel of maximum error\r\n(which is near the mean parallel).\r\n\r\n(b) Or the errors of scale of the extreme parallels may be equated to\r\nthat of the mean parallel. This is not so good a projection as (a).\r\n\r\n(c) Or the absolute errors of the extreme and mean parallels may be\r\nequated.\r\n\r\n(d) Or in the last the parallel of maximum error may be considered\r\ninstead of the mean parallel.\r\n\r\n(e) Or the mean length of all the parallels may be made correct. This is\r\nequivalent to making the total area between the extreme parallels\r\ncorrect, and must be combined with another condition, for example, that\r\nthe errors of scale on the extreme parallels shall be equal.\r\n\r\n  We will now discuss (a) above, viz. a conical projection with\r\n  rectified meridians and two standard parallels, the scale errors of\r\n  the extreme parallels and parallel of maximum error being equated.\r\n\r\n  Since the scale errors of the extreme parallels are to be equal,\r\n\r\n    h(z + c)       h(z + c´)                 c´ sin c - c sin c´\r\n    -------- - 1 = --------- - 1, whence z = -------------------  (i.)\r\n      sin c          sin c´                     sin c´ - sin c\r\n\r\n  The error of scale along any parallel (near the centre), of which the\r\n  co-latitude is b is\r\n\r\n    1 - {h(z + b)/sin b}.  (ii.)\r\n\r\n  This is a maximum when\r\n\r\n    (tan b) - b = z, whence b is found.\r\n\r\n  Also\r\n\r\n        h(z + b)   h(z + c)\r\n    1 - -------- = -------- - 1 whence h is found.  (iii.)\r\n          sin b      sin c\r\n\r\n  For the errorless parallels of co-latitudes [gamma] and [gamma]´ we\r\n  have\r\n\r\n    h = (z + [gamma])/sin [gamma] = (z + [gamma]´)/sin [gamma]´.\r\n\r\n  If this is applied to the case of a map of South Africa between the\r\n  limits 15° S. and 35° S. (see fig. 16) it will be found that the\r\n  parallel of maximum error is 25° 20´; the errorless parallels, to the\r\n  nearest degree, are those of 18° and 32°. The greatest scale error in\r\n  this case is about 0.7%.\r\n\r\n  In the above account the earth has been treated as a sphere. Of course\r\n  its real shape is approximately a spheroid of revolution, and the\r\n  values of the axes most commonly employed are those of Clarke or of\r\n  Bessel. For the spheroid, formulae arrived at by the same principles\r\n  but more cumbrous in shape must be used. But it will usually be\r\n  sufficient for the selection of the errorless parallels to use the\r\n  simple spherical formulae given above; then, having made the selection\r\n  of these parallels, the true spheroidal lengths along the meridians\r\n  between them can be taken out of the ordinary tables (such as those\r\n  published by the Ordnance Survey or by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic\r\n  Survey). Thus, if a1, a2, are the lengths of 1° of the errorless\r\n  parallels (taken from the tables), d the true rectified length of the\r\n  meridian arc between them (taken from the tables),\r\n\r\n    h = {(a2 - a1)/d}180/[pi],\r\n\r\n  and the radius on paper of parallel, a1 is a1d/(a2 - a1), and the\r\n  radius of any other parallel = radius of a1 ± the true meridian\r\n  distance between the parallels.\r\n\r\n  This class of projection was used for the 1/1,000,000 Ordnance map of\r\n  the British Isles. The three maximum scale errors in this case work\r\n  out to 0.23%, the range of the projection being from 50° N. to 61° N.,\r\n  and the errorless parallels are 59° 31´ and 51°44´.\r\n\r\n  Where no great refinement is required it will be sufficient to take\r\n  the errorless parallels as those distant from the extreme parallels\r\n  about one-sixth of the total range in latitude. Thus suppose it is\r\n  required to plot a projection for India between latitudes 8° and 40°\r\n  N. By this rough rule the errorless parallels should be distant from\r\n  the extreme parallels about 32°/6, i.e. 5° 20´; they should therefore,\r\n  to the nearest degree, be 13° and 35° N. The maximum scale errors will\r\n  be about 2%.\r\n\r\n  The scale errors vary approximately as the square of the range of\r\n  latitude; a rough rule is, largest scale error = L²/50,000, where L is\r\n  the range in the latitude in degrees. Thus a country with a range of\r\n  7° in latitude (nearly 500 m.) can be plotted on this projection with\r\n  a maximum linear scale error (along a parallel) of about 0.1%;[29]\r\n  there is no error along any meridian. It is immaterial with this\r\n  projection (or with any conical projection) what the extent in\r\n  longitude is. It is clear that this class of projection is accurate,\r\n  simple and useful.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: (From _Text Book of Topographical Surveying_, by\r\n  permission of the Controller of H. M. Stationery Office.)\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.--South Africa on a conical projection with rectified\r\n  meridians and two standard parallels. Scale 800 m. to 1 in.]\r\n\r\n  In the projections designated by (c) and (d) above, absolute errors of\r\n  length are considered in the place of errors of scale, i.e. between\r\n  any two meridians (c) the absolute errors of length of the extreme\r\n  parallels are equated to the absolute error of length of the middle\r\n  parallel. Using the same notation\r\n\r\n    h(z + c) - sin c = h(z + c´) - sin c´ = -h(z + ½c + ½c´) - sin ½(c + c´).\r\n\r\n  L. Euler, in the _Acta Acad. Imp. Petrop._ (1778), first discussed\r\n  this projection.\r\n\r\n  If a map of Asia between parallels 10° N. and 70° N. is constructed on\r\n  this system, we have c = 20°, c´ = 80°, whence from the above\r\n  equations z = 66.7° and h = .6138. The absolute errors of length along\r\n  parallels 10°, 40° and 70° between any two meridians are equal but the\r\n  scale errors are respectively 5, 6.7, and 15%.\r\n\r\n  The modification (d) of this projection was selected for the\r\n  1:1,000,000 map of _India and Adjacent Countries_ under publication by\r\n  the Survey of India. An account of this is given in a pamphlet\r\n  produced by that department in 1903. The limiting parallels are 8° and\r\n  40° N., and the parallel of greatest error is 23° 40´ 51´´. The errors\r\n  of scale are 1.8, 2.3, and 1.9%.\r\n\r\n  It is not as a rule desirable to select this form of the projection.\r\n  If the surface of the map is everywhere equally valuable it is clear\r\n  that an arrangement by which errors of scale are larger towards the\r\n  pole than towards the equator is unsound, and it is to be noted that\r\n  in the case quoted the great bulk of the land is in the north of the\r\n  map. Projection (a) would for the same region have three equal maximum\r\n  scale errors of 2%. It may be admitted that the practical difference\r\n  between the two forms is in this case insignificant, but linear scale\r\n  errors should be reduced as much as possible in maps intended for\r\n  general use.\r\n\r\n  f. In the fifth form of the projection, the total area of the\r\n  projection between the extreme parallels and any two meridians is\r\n  equated to the area of the portion of the sphere which it represents,\r\n  and the errors of scale of the extreme parallels are equated. Then it\r\n  is easy to show that\r\n\r\n    z = (c´ sin c - c sin c´) / (sin c´ - sin c);\r\n    h = (cos c - cos c´) / (c´ - c){z + ½(c + c´)}.\r\n\r\n  It can also be shown that any other zone of the same range in latitude\r\n  will have the same scale errors along its limiting parallels. For\r\n  instance, a series of projections may be constructed for zones, each\r\n  having a range of 10° of latitude, from the equator to the pole.\r\n  Treating the earth as a sphere and using the above formulae, the\r\n  series will possess the following properties: the meridians will all\r\n  be true to scale, the area of each zone will be correct, the scale\r\n  errors of the limiting parallels will all be the same, so that the\r\n  length of the upper parallel of any zone will be equal to that of the\r\n  lower parallel of the zone above it. But the curvatures of these\r\n  parallels will be different, and two adjacent zones will not fit but\r\n  will be capable of exact rolling contact. Thus a very instructive flat\r\n  model of the globe may be constructed which will show by suitably\r\n  arranging the points of contact of the zones the paths of great\r\n  circles on the sphere. The flat model was devised by Professor J. D.\r\n  Everett, F.R.S., who also pointed out that the projection had the\r\n  property of the equality of scale errors of the limiting parallels for\r\n  zones of the same width. The projection may be termed _Everett's\r\n  Projection_.\r\n\r\n_Simple Conical Projection._--If in the last group of projections the\r\ntwo selected parallels which are to be errorless approach each other\r\nindefinitely closely, we get a projection in which all the meridians\r\nare, as before, of the true rectified lengths, in which one parallel is\r\nerrorless, the curvature of that parallel being clearly that which would\r\nresult from the unrolling of a cone touching the sphere along the\r\nparallel represented. And it was in fact originally by a consideration\r\nof the tangent cone that the whole group of conical projections came\r\ninto being. The quasi-geometrical way of regarding conical projections\r\nis legitimate in this instance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n  The simple conical projection is therefore arrived at in this way:\r\n  imagine a cone to touch the sphere along any selected parallel, the\r\n  radius of this parallel on paper (Pp, fig. 17) will be r cot [phi],\r\n  where r is the radius of the sphere and [phi] is the latitude; or if\r\n  the spheroidal shape is taken into account, the radius of the parallel\r\n  on paper will be [nu] cot [phi] where [nu] is the normal terminated by\r\n  the minor axis (the value [nu] can be found from ordinary geodetic\r\n  tables). The meridians are generators of the cone and every parallel\r\n  such as HH´ is a circle, concentric with the selected parallel Pp and\r\n  distant from it the true rectified length of the meridian arc between\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  This projection has no merits as compared with the group just\r\n  described. The errors of scale along the parallels increase rapidly as\r\n  the selected parallel is departed from, the parallels on paper being\r\n  always too large. As an example we may take the case of a map of South\r\n  Africa of the same range as that of the example given in (a) above,\r\n  viz. from 15° S. to 35° S. Let the selected parallel be 25° S.; the\r\n  radius of this parallel on paper (taking the radius of the sphere as\r\n  unity) is cot 25°; the radius of parallel 35° S. = radius of 25° -\r\n  meridian distance between 25° and 35° = cot 25° - 10[pi]/180 = 1·970.\r\n  Also h = sin of selected latitude = sin 25°, and length on paper along\r\n  parallel 35° of [omega]° = [omega]h × 1.970 = [omega] × 1.970 × sin\r\n  25°,\r\n\r\n  but length on sphere of [omega] = [omega] cos 35°,\r\n\r\n                        1.970 sin 25°\r\n    hence scale error = ------------- - 1 = 1.6%,\r\n                           cos 35°\r\n\r\n  an error which is more than twice as great as that obtained by method\r\n  (a).\r\n\r\n_Bonne's Projection._--This projection, which is also called the\r\n\"modified conical projection,\" is derived from the simple conical, just\r\ndescribed, in the following way: a central meridian is chosen and drawn\r\nas a straight line; degrees of latitude spaced at the true rectified\r\ndistances are marked along this line; the parallels are concentric\r\ncircular arcs drawn through the proper points on the central meridian,\r\nthe centre of the arcs being fixed by describing one chosen parallel\r\nwith a radius of [nu] cot [phi] as before; the meridians on each side of\r\nthe central meridian are drawn as follows: along _each_ parallel\r\ndistances are marked equal to the true lengths along the parallels on\r\nsphere or spheroid, and the curve through corresponding points so fixed\r\nare the meridians (fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nThis system is that which was adopted in 1803 by the \"Dépôt de la\r\nGuerre\" for the map of France, and is there known by the title of\r\n_Projection de Bonne_. It is that on which the ordnance survey map of\r\nScotland on the scale of 1 in. to a mile is constructed, and it is\r\nfrequently met with in ordinary atlases. It is ill-adapted for countries\r\nhaving great extent in longitude, as the intersections of the meridians\r\nand parallels become very oblique--as will be seen on examining the map\r\nof Asia in most atlases.\r\n\r\n  If [phi]0 be taken as the latitude of the centre parallel, and\r\n  co-ordinates be measured from the intersection of this parallel with\r\n  the central meridian, then, if [rho] be the radius of the parallel of\r\n  latitude [phi], we have [rho] = cot [phi]0 + [phi]0 - [phi]. Also, if\r\n  S be a point on this parallel whose co-ordinates are x, y, so that VS\r\n  = [rho], and [theta] be the angle VS makes with the central meridian,\r\n  then [rho][theta] = [omega] cos [phi]; and x = [rho] sin [theta], y =\r\n  cot [phi]0 - [rho] cos [theta].\r\n\r\nThe projection has the property of equal areas, since each small element\r\nbounded by two infinitely close parallels is equal in length and width\r\nto the corresponding element on the sphere or spheroid. Also all the\r\nmeridians cross the chosen parallel (but no other) at right angles,\r\nsince in the immediate neighbourhood of that parallel the projection is\r\nidentical with the simple conical projection. Where an equal-area\r\nprojection is required for a country having no great extent in\r\nlongitude, such as France, Scotland or Madagascar, this projection is a\r\ngood one to select.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Sinusoidal Equal-area Projection.]\r\n\r\n_Sinusoidal Equal-area Projection._--This projection, which is\r\nsometimes known as Sanson's, and is also sometimes incorrectly called\r\nFlamsteed's, is a particular case of Bonne's in which the selected\r\nparallel is the equator. The equator is a straight line at right angles\r\nto the central meridian which is also a straight line. Along the central\r\nmeridian the latitudes are marked off at the true rectified distances,\r\nand from points so found the parallels are drawn as straight lines\r\nparallel to the equator, and therefore at right angles to the central\r\nmeridian. True rectified lengths are marked along the parallels and\r\nthrough corresponding points the meridians are drawn. If the earth is\r\ntreated as a sphere the meridians are clearly sine curves, and for this\r\nreason d'Avezac has given the projection the name sinusoidal. But it is\r\nequally easy to plot the spheroidal lengths. It is a very suitable\r\nprojection for an equal-area map of Africa.\r\n\r\n_Werner's Projection._--This is another limiting case of Bonne's\r\nequal-area projection in which the selected parallel is the pole. The\r\nparallels on paper then become incomplete circular arcs of which the\r\npole is the centre. The central meridian is still a straight line which\r\nis cut by the parallels at true distances. The projection (after Johann\r\nWerner, 1468-1528), though interesting, is practically useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyconic Projections._\r\n\r\nThese pseudo-conical projections are valuable not so much for their\r\nintrinsic merits as for the fact that they lend themselves to\r\ntabulation. There are two forms, the _simple_ or _equidistant\r\npolyconic_, and the _rectangular polyconic_.\r\n\r\n_The Simple Polyconic._--If a cone touches the sphere or spheroid along\r\na parallel of latitude [phi] and is then unrolled, the parallel will on\r\npaper have a radius of [nu] cot [phi], where [nu] is the normal\r\nterminated by the minor axis. If we imagine a series of cones, each of\r\nwhich touches one of a selected series of parallels, the apex of each\r\ncone will lie on the prolonged axis of the spheroid; the generators of\r\neach cone lie in meridian planes, and if each cone is unrolled and the\r\ngenerators in any one plane are superposed to form a straight central\r\nmeridian, we obtain a projection in which the central meridian is a\r\nstraight line and the parallels are circular arcs each of which has a\r\ndifferent centre which lies on the prolongation of the central meridian,\r\nthe radius of any parallel being [nu] cot [phi].\r\n\r\nSo far the construction is the same for both forms of polyconic. In the\r\n_simple polyconic_ the meridians are obtained by measuring outwards from\r\nthe central meridian along each parallel the true lengths of the degrees\r\nof longitude. Through corresponding points so found the meridian curves\r\nare drawn. The resulting projection is accurate near the central\r\nmeridian, but as this is departed from the parallels increasingly\r\nseparate from each other, and the parallels and meridians (except along\r\nthe equator) intersect at angles which increasingly differ from a right\r\nangle. The real merit of the projection is that each particular parallel\r\nhas for every map the same absolute radius, and it is thus easy to\r\nconstruct tables which shall be of universal use. This is especially\r\nvaluable for the projection of single sheets on comparatively large\r\nscales. A sheet of a degree square on a scale of 1:250,000 projected in\r\nthis manner differs inappreciably from the same sheet projected on a\r\nbetter system, e.g. an orthomorphic conical projection or the conical\r\nwith rectified meridians and two standard parallels; there is thus the\r\nadvantage that the simple polyconic when used for single sheets and\r\nlarge scales is a sufficiently close approximation to the better forms\r\nof conical projection. The simple polyconic is used by the\r\ntopographical section of the general staff, by the United States coast\r\nand geodetic survey and by the topographical division of the U.S.\r\ngeological survey. Useful tables, based on Clarke's spheroid of 1866,\r\nhave been published by the war office and by the U.S. coast and geodetic\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\n_Rectangular Polyconic._--In this the central meridian and the parallels\r\nare drawn as in the simple polyconic, but the meridians are curves which\r\ncut the parallels at right angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n  In this case, let P (fig. 20) be the north pole, CPU the central\r\n  meridian, U, U´ points in that meridian whose co-latitudes are z and\r\n  z+dz, so that UU´ = dz. Make PU = z, UC = tan z, U´C´ = tan (z + dz);\r\n  and with CC´ as centres describe the arcs UQ, U´Q´, which represent\r\n  the parallels of co-latitude z and z+dz. Let PQQ´ be part of a\r\n  meridian curve cutting the parallels at right angles. Join CQ, C´Q´;\r\n  these being perpendicular to the circles will be tangents to the\r\n  curve. Let UCQ = 2[alpha], UC´Q´ = 2([alpha] + d[alpha]), then the\r\n  small angle CQC´, or the angle between the tangents at QQ´, will =\r\n  2d[alpha]. Now\r\n\r\n    CC´ = C´U´- CU - UU´ = tan (z + dz) - tan z - dz = tan² z dz.\r\n\r\n  The tangents CQ, C´Q´ will intersect at q, and in the triangle CC´q\r\n  the perpendicular from C on C´q is (omitting small quantities of the\r\n  second order) equal to either side of the equation\r\n\r\n    tan² z dz sin 2[alpha] = -2 tan zd [alpha].\r\n                 -tan z dz = 2d[alpha] / sin 2[alpha],\r\n\r\n  which is the differential equation of the meridian: the integral is\r\n  tan [alpha] = [omega] cos z, where [omega], a constant, determines a\r\n  particular meridian curve. The distance of Q from the central\r\n  meridian, tan z sin 2[alpha], is equal to\r\n\r\n    2 tan z tan [alpha]        2[omega] sin z\r\n    ------------------- = -------------------------\r\n      1 + tan² [alpha]    1 + [omega]² cos² [alpha]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n  At the equator this becomes simply 2[omega]. Let any equatorial point\r\n  whose actual longitude is 2[omega] be represented by a point on the\r\n  developed equator at the distance 2[omega] from the central meridian,\r\n  then we have the following very simple construction (due to O'Farrell\r\n  of the ordnance survey). Let P (fig. 21) be the pole, U any point in\r\n  the central meridian, QUQ´ the represented parallel whose radius CU =\r\n  tan z. Draw SUS´ perpendicular to the meridian through U; then to\r\n  determine the point Q, whose longitude is, say, 3°, lay off US equal\r\n  to half the true length of the arc of parallel on the sphere, i.e. 1°\r\n  30´ to radius sin z, and with the centre S and radius SU describe a\r\n  circular arc, which will intersect the parallel in the required point\r\n  Q. For if we suppose 2[omega] to be the longitude of the required\r\n  point Q, US is by construction = [omega] sin z, and the angle\r\n  subtended by SU at C is\r\n\r\n              /[omega] sin z\\\r\n    tan^(-1) ( ------------- ) = tan^(-1) ([omega] cos z) = [alpha],\r\n              \\    tan z    /\r\n\r\n  and therefore UCQ = 2[alpha] as it should be. The advantages of this\r\n  method are that with a remarkably simple and convenient mode of\r\n  construction we have a map in which the parallels and meridians\r\n  intersect at right angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nFig. 22 is a representation of this system of the continents of Europe\r\nand Africa, for which it is well suited. For Asia this system would not\r\ndo, as in the northern latitudes, say along the parallel of 70°, the\r\nrepresentation is much cramped.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the distortion in the map of Africa as thus constructed,\r\nconsider a small square in latitude 40° and in 40° longitude east or\r\nwest of the central meridian, the square being so placed as to be\r\ntransformed into a rectangle. The sides, originally unity, became 0.95\r\nand 1.13, and the area 1.08, the diagonals intersecting at 90° ± 9° 56´.\r\nIn Clarke's perspective projection a square of unit side occupying the\r\nsame position, when transformed to a rectangle, has its sides 1.02 and\r\n1.15, its area 1.17, and its diagonals intersect at 90° ± 7° 6´. The\r\nlatter projection is therefore the best in point of \"similarity,\" but\r\nthe former represents areas best. This applies, however, only to a\r\nparticular part of the map; along the equator towards 30° or 40°\r\nlongitude, the polyconic is certainly inferior, while along the meridian\r\nit is better than the perspective--except, of course, near the centre.\r\nUpon the whole the more even distribution of distortion gives the\r\nadvantage to the perspective system. For single sheets on large scales\r\nthere is nothing to choose between this projection and the simple\r\npolyconic. Both are sensibly perfect representations. The rectangular\r\npolyconic is occasionally used by the topographical section of the\r\ngeneral staff.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Zenithal Projections._\r\n\r\nSome point on the earth is selected as the central point of the map;\r\ngreat circles radiating from this point are represented by straight\r\nlines which are inclined at their true angles at the point of\r\nintersection. Distances along the radiating lines vary according to any\r\nlaw outwards from the centre. It follows (on the spherical assumption),\r\nthat circles of which the selected point is the centre are also circles\r\non the projection. It is obvious that all perspective projections are\r\nzenithal.\r\n\r\n_Equidistant Zenithal Projection._--In this projection, which is\r\ncommonly called the \"equidistant projection,\" any point on the sphere\r\nbeing taken as the centre of the map, great circles through this point\r\nare represented by straight lines of the true rectified lengths, and\r\nintersect each other at the true angles.\r\n\r\n  In the general case--\r\n\r\n  if z1 is the co-latitude of the centre of the map, z the co-latitude\r\n  of any other point, [alpha] the difference of longitude of the two\r\n  points, A the azimuth of the line joining them, and c the spherical\r\n  length of the line joining them, then the position of the intersection\r\n  of any meridian with any parallel is given (on the spherical\r\n  assumption) by the solution of a simple spherical triangle.\r\n\r\n  Thus--\r\n\r\n  let tan [theta] = tan z cos [alpha], then cos c = cos z sec [theta]\r\n  cos (z - [theta]), and sin A = sin z sin [alpha] cosec c.\r\n\r\nThe most useful case is that in which the central point is the pole; the\r\nmeridians are straight lines inclined to each other at the true angular\r\ndifferences of longitude, and the parallels are equidistant circles with\r\nthe pole as centre. This is the best projection to use for maps\r\nexhibiting the progress of polar discovery, and is called the _polar\r\nequidistant projection_. The errors are smaller than might be supposed.\r\nThere are no scale errors along the meridians, and along the parallels\r\nthe scale error is (z / sin x) - 1, where z is the co-latitude of the\r\nparallel. On a parallel 10° distant from the pole the error of scale is\r\nonly 0.5%.\r\n\r\n  _General Theory of Zenithal Projections._--For the sake of simplicity\r\n  it will be at first assumed that the pole is the centre of the map,\r\n  and that the earth is a sphere. According to what has been said above,\r\n  the meridians are now straight lines diverging from the pole, dividing\r\n  the 360° into equal angles; and the parallels are represented by\r\n  circles having the pole as centre, the radius of the parallel whose\r\n  co-latitude is z being [rho], a certain function of z. The particular\r\n  function selected determines the nature of the projection.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n  Let Ppq, Prs (fig. 23) be two contiguous meridians crossed by\r\n  parallels rp, sq, and Op´q´, Or´s´ the straight lines representing\r\n  these meridians. If the angle at P is d[mu], this also is the value of\r\n  the angle at O. Let the co-latitude\r\n\r\n    Pp = z, Pq = z + dz; Op´ = [rho], Oq´ = [rho] + d[rho],\r\n\r\n  the circular arcs p´r´, q´s´ representing the parallels pr, qs. If the\r\n  radius of the sphere be unity,\r\n\r\n    p´q´ = d[rho]; p´r´ = [rho] d[mu],\r\n    pq   = dz; pr = sin z d[mu].\r\n\r\n  Put\r\n\r\n    [sigma] = d[rho]/dz; [sigma]´ = [rho]/sin z,\r\n\r\n  then p´q´ = [sigma]pq and p´r´ = [sigma]´pr. That is to say, [sigma],\r\n  [sigma]´ may be regarded as the relative scales, at co-latitude z, of\r\n  the representation, [sigma] applying to meridional measurements,\r\n  [sigma]´ to measurements perpendicular to the meridian. A small square\r\n  situated in co-latitude z, having one side in the direction of the\r\n  meridian--the length of its side being i--is represented by a\r\n  rectangle whose sides are i[sigma] and i[sigma]´; its area\r\n  consequently is i²[sigma][sigma]´.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to make a perfect representation, then we should\r\nhave [sigma] = 1, [sigma]´ = 1 throughout. This, however, is impossible.\r\nWe may make [sigma] = 1 throughout by taking [rho] = z. This is the\r\n_Equidistant Projection_ just described, a very simple and effective\r\nmethod of representation.\r\n\r\nOr we may make [sigma]´= 1 throughout. This gives [rho] = sin z, a\r\nperspective projection, namely, the _Orthographic_.\r\n\r\nOr we may require that areas be strictly represented in the development.\r\nThis will be effected by making [sigma][sigma]´ = 1, or [rho]d[rho] =\r\nsin z dz, the integral of which is [rho] = 2 sin ½z, which is the\r\n_Zenithal Equal-area Projection_ of Lambert, sometimes, though wrongly\r\nreferred to as _Lorgna's Projection_ after Antonio Lorgna (b. 1736). In\r\nthis system there is misrepresentation of form, but no misrepresentation\r\nof areas.\r\n\r\nOr we may require a projection in which all small parts are to be\r\nrepresented in their true forms i.e. an orthomorphic projection. For\r\ninstance, a small square on the spherical surface is to be represented\r\nas a small square in the development. This condition will be attained by\r\nmaking [sigma] = [sigma]´, or d[rho]/[rho] = dz/sin z, the integral of\r\nwhich is, c being an arbitrary constant, [rho] = c tan ½z. This, again,\r\nis a perspective projection, namely, the _Stereographic_. In this,\r\nthough all small parts of the surface are represented in their correct\r\nshapes, yet, the scale varying from one part of the map to another, the\r\n_whole_ is not a similar representation of the original. The scale,\r\n[sigma] = ½c sec² ½z, at any point, applies to all directions round that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n  These two last projections are, as it were, at the extremes of the\r\n  scale; each, perfect in its own way, is in other respects\r\n  objectionable. We may avoid both extremes by the following\r\n  considerations. Although we cannot make [sigma] = 1 and [sigma]´ = 1,\r\n  so as to have a perfect picture of the spherical surface, yet\r\n  considering [sigma] - 1 and [sigma]´ - 1 as the local errors of the\r\n  representation, we may make ([sigma] - 1)² + ([sigma]´ - 1)² a minimum\r\n  over the whole surface to be represented. To effect this we must\r\n  multiply this expression by the element of surface to which it\r\n  applies, viz. sin zd zd [mu], and then integrate from the centre to\r\n  the (circular) limits of the map. Let [beta] be the spherical radius\r\n  of the segment to be represented, then the total misrepresentation is\r\n  to be taken as\r\n      _        _                              _\r\n     / [beta] |  /d[rho]    \\²    /[rho]    \\² |\r\n     |        | ( ------ - 1 ) + ( ----- - 1 ) | sin z dz,\r\n    _/ 0      |_ \\  dz      /     \\sin z    / _|\r\n\r\n  which is to be made a minimum. Putting [rho] = z + y, and giving to y\r\n  only a variation subject to the condition [delta]y = 0 when z = 0, the\r\n  equations of solution--using the ordinary notation of the calculus of\r\n  variations--are\r\n\r\n        d(P)\r\n    N - ---- = 0; P[beta] = 0,\r\n         dz\r\n\r\n  P[beta] being the value of 2p sin z when z = [beta]. This gives\r\n\r\n           d²y               dy                  /dy\\\r\n    sin² z --- + sin z cos z -- - y = z - sin z ( -- )[beta] = 0.\r\n           dz²               dz                  \\dz/\r\n\r\n  This method of development is due to Sir George Airy, whose original\r\n  paper--the investigation is different in form from the above, which is\r\n  due to Colonel Clarke--will be found in the _Philosophical Magazine_\r\n  for 1861. The solution of the differential equation leads to this\r\n  result--\r\n\r\n    [rho] = 2 cot ½z log_e sec ½z + C tan ½z,\r\n    C     = 2 cot² ½[beta] log_e sec ½[beta].\r\n\r\n  The limiting radius of the map is R = 2C tan ½[beta]. In this system,\r\n  called by Sir George Airy _Projection by balance of errors_, the total\r\n  misrepresentation is an absolute minimum. For short it may be called\r\n  _Airy's Projection_.\r\n\r\n  Returning to the general case where [rho] is any function of z, let us\r\n  consider the local misrepresentation of direction. Take any\r\n  indefinitely small line, length = i, making an angle [alpha] with the\r\n  meridian in co-latitude z. Its projections on a meridian and parallel\r\n  are i cos [alpha], i sin [alpha], which in the map are represented by\r\n  i[sigma] cos [alpha], i[sigma]´ sin [alpha]. If then [alpha]´ be the\r\n  angle in the map corresponding to [alpha],\r\n\r\n    tan [alpha]´ = ([sigma]´/[sigma]) tan [alpha].\r\n\r\n  Put\r\n\r\n    [sigma]´/[sigma] = [rho]dz/sin z d[rho] = [Sigma],\r\n\r\n  and the error [alpha]´ - [alpha] of representation = [epsilon], then\r\n\r\n                    ([Sigma] - 1) tan [alpha]\r\n    tan [epsilon] = -------------------------.\r\n                    1 + [Sigma] tan² [alpha]\r\n\r\n  Put [Sigma] = cot²[zeta], then [epsilon] is a maximum when [alpha] =\r\n  [zeta], and the corresponding value of [epsilon] is\r\n\r\n    [epsilon] = ½[pi] - 2[zeta].\r\n\r\nFor simplicity of explanation we have supposed this method of\r\ndevelopment so applied as to have the pole in the centre. There is,\r\nhowever, no necessity for this, and any point on the surface of the\r\nsphere may be taken as the centre. All that is necessary is to calculate\r\nby spherical trigonometry the azimuth and distance, with reference to\r\nthe assumed centre, of all the points of intersection of meridians and\r\nparallels within the space which is to be represented in a plane. Then\r\nthe azimuth is represented unaltered, and any spherical distance z is\r\nrepresented by [rho]. Thus we get all the points of intersection\r\ntransferred to the representation, and it remains merely to draw\r\ncontinuous lines through these points, which lines will be the meridians\r\nand parallels in the representation.\r\n\r\nThus treating the earth as a sphere and applying the _Zenithal\r\nEqual-area Projection_ to the case of Africa, the central point selected\r\nbeing on the equator, we have, if [theta] be the spherical distance of\r\nany point from the centre, [phi], [alpha] the latitude and longitude\r\n(with reference to the centre), of this point, cos [theta] = cos [phi]\r\ncos [alpha]. If A is the azimuth of this point at the centre, tan A =\r\nsin [alpha] cot [phi]. On paper a line from the centre is drawn at an\r\nazimuth A, and the distance [theta] is represented by 2 sin ½[theta].\r\nThis makes a very good projection for a single-sheet equal-area map of\r\nAfrica. The exaggeration in such systems, it is important to remember,\r\nwhether of linear scale, area, or angle, is the same for a given\r\ndistance from the centre, whatever be the azimuth; that is, the\r\nexaggeration is a function of the distance from the centre only.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Theory of Conical Projections._\r\n\r\nMeridians are represented by straight lines drawn through a point, and a\r\ndifference of longitude [omega] is represented by an angle h[omega]. The\r\nparallels of latitude are circular arcs, all having as centre the point\r\nof divergence of the meridian lines. It is clear that perspective and\r\nzenithal projections are particular groups of conical projections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n  Let z be the co-latitude of a parallel, and [rho], a function of z,\r\n  the radius of the circle representing this parallel. Consider the\r\n  infinitely small space on the sphere contained by two consecutive\r\n  meridians, the difference of whose longitude is d[mu], and two\r\n  consecutive parallels whose co-latitudes are z and z + dz. The sides\r\n  of this rectangle are pq = dz, pr = sin z d[mu]; in the projection\r\n  p´q´r´s´ these become p´q´ = d[rho], and p´r´ = [rho]h d[mu].\r\n\r\n  The scales of the projection as compared with the sphere are p´q´/pq =\r\n  d[rho]/dz = the scale of meridian measurements = [sigma], say, and\r\n  p´r´/pr = [rho]h d[mu]/sin z d[mu] = [rho]h/sin z = scale of\r\n  measurements perpendicular to the meridian = [sigma]´, say.\r\n\r\n  Now we may make [sigma] = 1 throughout, then [rho] = z + const. This\r\n  gives either the group of _conical projections with rectified\r\n  meridians_, or as a particular case the _equidistant zenithal_.\r\n\r\n  We may make [sigma] = [sigma]´ throughout, which is the same as\r\n  requiring that at any point the scale shall be the same in all\r\n  directions. This gives a group of _orthomorphic projections_.\r\n\r\n  In this case d[rho]/dz = [rho]h/sin z, or d[rho]/[rho] = h dz/sin z.\r\n\r\n  Integrating,\r\n\r\n    [rho] = k(tan ½z)^h, (i.)\r\n\r\n  where k is a constant.\r\n\r\n  Now h is at our disposal and we may give it such a value that two\r\n  selected parallels are of the correct lengths. Let z1, z2 be the\r\n  co-latitudes of these parallels, then it is easy to show that\r\n\r\n         log sin z1 - log sin z2\r\n    h = -------------------------  (ii.)\r\n        log tan ½z1 - log tan ½z2\r\n\r\n  This projection, given by equations (i.) and (ii.), is Lambert's\r\n  orthomorphic projection--commonly called Gauss's projection; its\r\n  descriptive name is the _orthomorphic conical projection with two\r\n  standard parallels_.\r\n\r\n  The constant k in (i.) defines the scale and may be used to render the\r\n  scale errors along the selected parallels not nil but the same; and\r\n  some other parallel, e.g. the central parallel may then be made\r\n  errorless.\r\n\r\n  The value h = 1/3, as suggested by Sir John Herschel, is admirably\r\n  suited for a map of the world. The representation is fan-shaped, with\r\n  remarkably little distortion (fig. 24).\r\n\r\n  If any parallel of co-latitude z is true to scale hk(tan ½z1)^h = sin\r\n  z, if this parallel is the equator, so that z1 = 90°, kh = 1, then\r\n  equation (i.) becomes [rho] = (tan ½z)^h/h, and the radius of the\r\n  equator = 1/h. The distance r of any parallel from the equator is 1/h\r\n  - (tan ½z)^h/h = (1/h){1 - (tan ½z)^h}.\r\n\r\n  If, instead of taking the radius of the earth as unity we call it a, r\r\n  = (a/h){1 - (tan ½z)^h}. When h is very small, the angles between the\r\n  meridian lines in the representation are very small; and proceeding to\r\n  the limit, when h is zero the meridians are parallel--that is, the\r\n  vertex of the cone has removed to infinity. And at the limit when h is\r\n  zero we have r = a log_e cot ½z, which is the characteristic equation\r\n  of Mercator's projection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Elliptical equal-area Projection, showing the\r\nwhole surface of the globe.]\r\n\r\n_Mercator's Projection._--From the manner in which we have arrived at\r\nthis projection it is clear that it retains the characteristic property\r\nof orthomorphic projections--namely, similarity of representation of\r\nsmall parts of the surface. In Mercator's chart the equator is\r\nrepresented by a straight line, which is crossed at right angles by a\r\nsystem of parallel and equidistant straight lines representing the\r\nmeridians. The parallels are straight lines parallel to the equator, and\r\nthe distance of the parallel of latitude [phi] from the equator is, as\r\nwe have seen above, r = a log_e tan (45° + ½[phi]). In the vicinity of\r\nthe equator, or indeed within 30° of latitude of the equator, the\r\nrepresentation is very accurate, but as we proceed northwards or\r\nsouthwards the exaggeration of area becomes larger, and eventually\r\nexcessive--the poles being at infinity. This distance of the parallels\r\nmay be expressed in the form r = a (sin [phi] + 1/3 sin ^3[phi] + 1/5\r\nsin ^5[phi] + ...), showing that near the equator r is nearly\r\nproportional to the latitude. As a consequence of the similar\r\nrepresentation of small parts, a curve drawn on the sphere cutting all\r\nmeridians at the same angle--the loxodromic curve--is projected into a\r\nstraight line, and it is this property which renders Mercator's chart so\r\nvaluable to seamen. For instance: join by a straight line on the chart\r\nLand's End and Bermuda, and measure the angle of intersection of this\r\nline with the meridian. We get thus the bearing which a ship has to\r\nretain during its course between these ports. This is not great-circle\r\nsailing, and the ship so navigated does not take the shortest path. The\r\nprojection of a great circle (being neither a meridian nor the equator)\r\nis a curve which cannot be represented by a simple algebraic equation.\r\n\r\n  If the true spheroidal shape of the earth is considered, the semiaxes\r\n  being a and b, putting e = [root] (a² - b²)/a, and using common\r\n  logarithms, the distance of any parallel from the equator can be shown\r\n  to be\r\n\r\n    (a/M) {log tan (45° + ½[phi]) - e² sin [phi] - 1/3 e^4 sin ^3[phi] ...}\r\n\r\n  where M, the modulus of common logarithms, = 0.434294. Of course\r\n  Mercator's projection was not originally arrived at in the manner\r\n  above described; the description has been given to show that\r\n  Mercator's projection is a particular case of the conical orthomorphic\r\n  group. The introduction of the projection is due to the fact that for\r\n  navigation it is very desirable to possess charts which shall give\r\n  correct local outlines (i.e. in modern phraseology shall be\r\n  orthomorphic) and shall at the same time show as a straight line any\r\n  line which cuts the meridians at a constant angle. The latter\r\n  condition clearly necessitates parallel meridians, and the former a\r\n  continuous increase of scale as the equator is departed from, i.e. the\r\n  scale at any point must be equal to the scale at the equator × sec.\r\n  latitude. In early days the calculations were made by assuming that\r\n  for a small increase of latitude, say 1´, the scale was constant, then\r\n  summing up the small lengths so obtained. Nowadays (for simplicity the\r\n  earth will be taken as a sphere) we should say that a small length of\r\n  meridian ad[phi] is represented in this projection by a sec [phi]\r\n  d[phi], and the length of the meridian in the projection between the\r\n  equator and latitude [phi],\r\n\r\n       /[phi]\r\n      /      a sec [phi] d[phi] = a log_e tan (45° + ½[phi]),\r\n    \\/ 0\r\n\r\n  which is the direct way of arriving at the law of the construction of\r\n  this very important projection.\r\n\r\n  Mercator's projection, although indispensable at sea, is of little\r\n  value for land maps. For topographical sheets it is obviously\r\n  unsuitable; and in cases in which it is required to show large areas\r\n  on small scales on an orthomorphic projection, that form should be\r\n  chosen which gives two standard parallels (Lambert's conical\r\n  orthomorphic). Mercator's projection is often used in atlases for maps\r\n  of the world. It is not a good projection to select for this purpose\r\n  on account of the great exaggeration of scale near the poles. The\r\n  misconceptions arising from this exaggeration of scale may, however,\r\n  be corrected by the juxtaposition of a map of the world on an\r\n  equal-area projection.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to revert to the general consideration of conical\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\n  It has been shown that the scales of the projection (fig. 23) as\r\n  compared with the sphere are p´q´/pq = dp/dz = [sigma] along a\r\n  meridian, and p´r´/pr´ = [rho]h / sin z = [sigma]´ at right angles to\r\n  a meridian.\r\n\r\n  Now if [sigma][sigma]´ = 1 the areas are correctly represented, then\r\n\r\n    h[rho] d[rho] = sin z dz, and integrating ½h[rho]² = C - cos z;  (i.)\r\n\r\n  this gives the whole group of _equal-area conical projections_.\r\n\r\n  As a special case let the pole be the centre of the projected\r\n  parallels, then when\r\n\r\n    z = 0, [rho] = 0, and const = 1, we have p = 2 sin ½z/[delta]h  (ii.)\r\n\r\n  Let z1 be the co-latitude of some parallel which is to be correctly\r\n  represented, then 2h sin ½z1/[delta]h = sin z1, and h = cos² ½z1;\r\n  putting this value of h in equation (ii.) the radius of any parallel\r\n\r\n    = [rho] = 2 sin ½z sec ½z1  (iii.)\r\n\r\n  This is Lambert's _conical equal-area projection with one standard\r\n  parallel_, the pole being the centre of the parallels.\r\n\r\n  If we put z1 = [theta], then h = 1, and the meridians are inclined at\r\n  their true angles, also the scale at the pole becomes correct, and\r\n  equation (iii.) becomes\r\n\r\n    [rho] = 2 sin ½z;  (iv.)\r\n\r\n  this is the _zenithal equal-area projection_.\r\n\r\n  Reverting to the general expression for equal-area conical projections\r\n\r\n   [rho] = [root]{2(C - cos z)/h},  (i.)\r\n\r\n  we can dispose of C and h so that any two selected parallels shall be\r\n  their true lengths; let their co-latitudes be z1 and z2, then\r\n\r\n    2h(C - cos z1) = sin² z1  (v.)\r\n    2h(C - cos z2) = sin² z2  (vi.)\r\n\r\n  from which C and h are easily found, and the radii are obtained from\r\n  (i.) above. This is H. C. Albers' _conical equal-area projection with\r\n  two standard parallels_. The pole is not the centre of the parallels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Projection by Rectangular Spheroidal Co-ordinates._\r\n\r\nIf in the simple conical projection the selected parallel is the\r\nequator, this and the other parallels become parallel straight lines and\r\nthe meridians are straight lines spaced at equatorial distances, cutting\r\nthe parallels at right angles; the parallels are their true distances\r\napart. This projection is the _simple cylindrical_. If now we imagine\r\nthe touching cylinder turned through a right-angle In such a way as to\r\ntouch the sphere along any meridian, a projection is obtained exactly\r\nsimilar to the last, except that in this case we represent, not\r\nparallels and meridians, but small circles parallel to the given\r\nmeridian and great circles at right angles to it. It is clear that the\r\nprojection is a special case of conical projection. The position of any\r\npoint on the earth's surface is thus referred, on this projection, to a\r\nselected meridian as one axis, and any great circle at right angles to\r\nit as the other. Or, in other words, any point is fixed by the length of\r\nthe perpendicular from it on to the fixed meridian and the distance of\r\nthe foot of the perpendicular from some fixed point on the meridian,\r\nthese spherical or spheroidal co-ordinates being plotted as plane\r\nrectangular co-ordinates.\r\n\r\n  The perpendicular is really a plane section of the surface through the\r\n  given point at right angles to the chosen meridian, and may be briefly\r\n  called a great circle. Such a great circle clearly diverges from the\r\n  parallel; the exact difference in latitude and longitude between the\r\n  point and the foot of the perpendicular can be at once obtained by\r\n  ordinary geodetic formulae, putting the azimuth = 90°. Approximately\r\n  the difference of latitude in seconds is x² tan [phi] cosec 1´´ /\r\n  2[rho][nu] where x is the length of the perpendicular, [rho] that of\r\n  the radius of curvature to the meridian, [nu] that of the normal\r\n  terminated by the minor axis, [phi] the latitude of the foot of the\r\n  perpendicular. The difference of longitude in seconds is approximately\r\n  x sec [rho] cosec 1´´ / [nu]. The resulting error consists principally\r\n  of an exaggeration of scale north and south and is approximately equal\r\n  to sec x (expressing x in arc); it is practically independent of the\r\n  extent in latitude.\r\n\r\nIt is on this projection that the 1/2,500 Ordnance maps and the 6-in.\r\nOrdnance maps of the United Kingdom are plotted, a meridian being chosen\r\nfor a group of counties. It is also used for the 1-in., ½ in. and ¼ in.\r\nOrdnance maps of England, the central meridian chosen being that which\r\npasses through a point in Delamere Forest in Cheshire. This projection\r\nshould not as a rule be used for topographical maps, but is suitable for\r\ncadastral plans on account of the convenience of plotting the\r\nrectangular co-ordinates of the very numerous trigonometrical or\r\ntraverse points required in the construction of such plans. As regards\r\nthe errors involved, a range of about 150 miles each side of the central\r\nmeridian will give a maximum error in scale in a north and south\r\ndirection of about 0.1%.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Elliptical Equal-area Projection._\r\n\r\nIn this projection, which is also called Mollweide's projection the\r\nparallels are parallel straight lines and the meridians are ellipses,\r\nthe central meridian being a straight line at right angles to the\r\nequator, which is equally divided. If the whole world is represented on\r\nthe spherical assumption, the equator is twice the length of the central\r\nmeridian. Each elliptical meridian has for one axis the central\r\nmeridian, and for the other the intercepted portion of the equally\r\ndivided equator. It follows that the meridians 90° east and west of the\r\ncentral meridian form a circle. It is easy to show that to preserve the\r\nproperty of equal areas the distance of any parallel from the equator\r\nmust be [root]2 sin [delta] where [pi] sin [phi] = 2[delta] + sin\r\n2[delta], [phi] being the latitude of the parallel. The length of the\r\ncentral meridian from pole to pole = 2 [root]2, where the radius of the\r\nsphere is unity. The length of the equator = 4 [root]2.\r\n\r\nThe following equal-area projections may be used to exhibit the entire\r\nsurface of the globe: Cylindrical equal area, Sinusoidal equal area and\r\nElliptical equal area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Globular Projection.]\r\n\r\n_Conventional or Arbitrary Projections._\r\n\r\nThese projections are devised for simplicity of drawing and not for any\r\nspecial properties. The most useful projection of this class is the\r\n_globular projection_. This is a conventional representation of a\r\nhemisphere in which the equator and central meridian are two equal\r\nstraight lines at right angles, their intersection being the centre of\r\nthe circular boundary. The meridians divide the equator into equal parts\r\nand are arcs of circles passing through points so determined and the\r\npoles. The parallels are arcs of circles which divide the central and\r\nextreme meridians into equal parts. Thus in fig. 26 NS = EW and each is\r\ndivided into equal parts (in this case each division is 10°); the\r\ncircumference NESW is also divided into 10° spaces and circular arcs are\r\ndrawn through the corresponding points. This is a simple and effective\r\nprojection and one well suited for conveying ideas of the general shape\r\nand position of the chief land masses; it is better for this purpose\r\nthan the stereographic, which is commonly employed in atlases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (From _Text Book of Topographical Surveying_, by\r\npermission of the Controller of H.M. Stationery Office.)\r\n\r\nFIG. 27.--Plane Table Graticule, dimensions in inches, for a scale of 4\r\nin. to 1 m.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Projections for Field Sheets._\r\n\r\nField sheets for topographical surveys should be on conical projections\r\nwith rectified meridians; these projections for small areas and ordinary\r\ntopographical scales--not less than 1/500,000--are sensibly errorless.\r\nBut to save labour it is customary to employ for this purpose either\r\nform of polyconic projection, in which the errors for such scales are\r\nalso negligible. In some surveys, to avoid the difficulty of plotting\r\nthe flat arcs required for the parallels, the arcs are replaced by\r\npolygons, each side being the length of the portion of the arc it\r\nreplaces. This method is especially suitable for scales of 1:125,000 and\r\nlarger, but it is also sometimes used for smaller scales.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 27 shows the method of plotting the projection for a field sheet.\r\n  Such a projection is usually called a graticule. In this case ABC is\r\n  the central meridian; the true meridian lengths of 30´ spaces are\r\n  marked on this meridian, and to each of these, such as AB, the figure\r\n  (in this case representing a square half degree), such as ABED, is\r\n  applied. Thus the point D is the intersection of a circle of radius AD\r\n  with a circle of radius BD, these lengths being taken from geodetic\r\n  tables. The method has no merit except that of convenience.\r\n\r\n  _Summary._\r\n\r\n  The following projections have been briefly described:--\r\n\r\n                 /  1. Cylindrical equal-area.\r\n                 |  2. Orthographic.\r\n                 |  3. Stereographic (which is orthomorphic).\r\n    Perspective <   4. General external perspective.\r\n                 |  5. Minimum error         \"      (Clarke's).\r\n                 \\  6. Central.\r\n\r\n                 /  7. Conical, with rectified meridians and two\r\n                 |      standard parallels (5 forms).\r\n                 |  8. Simple conical.\r\n                 |  9. Simple cylindrical (a special case of 8).\r\n                 | 10. Modified conical equal-area (Bonne's).\r\n                 | 11. Sinusoidal         \"     \"  (Sanson's).\r\n                 | 12. Werner's conical   \"     \"\r\n    Conical     < 13. Simple polyconic.\r\n                 | 14. Rectangular polyconic.\r\n                 | 15. Conical orthomorphic with 2 standard parallels\r\n                 |      (Lambert's, commonly called Gauss's).\r\n                 | 16. Cylindrical orthomorphic (Mercator's).\r\n                 | 17. Conical equal-area with one standard parallel.\r\n                 | 18.    \"      \"     \"    \"  two     \"    parallels.\r\n                 \\ 19. Projection by rectangular spheroidal co-ordinates.\r\n\r\n                 / 20. Equidistant zenithal.\r\n                 | 21. Zenithal equal-area.\r\n                 | 22. Zenithal projection by balance of errors (Airy's).\r\n    Zenithal    <  23. Elliptical equal-area (Mollweide's).\r\n                 | 24. Globular (conventional).\r\n                 \\ 25. Field sheet graticule.\r\n\r\n  Of the above 25 projections, 23 are conical or quasi-conical, if\r\n  zenithal and perspective projections be included. The projections may,\r\n  if it is preferred, be grouped according to their properties. Thus in\r\n  the above list 8 are equal-area, 3 are orthomorphic, 1 balances\r\n  errors, 1 represents all great circles by straight lines, and in 5 one\r\n  system of great circles is represented correctly.\r\n\r\n  Among projections which have not been described may be mentioned the\r\n  circular orthomorphic (Lagrange's) and the rectilinear equal-area\r\n  (Collignon's) and a considerable number of conventional projections,\r\n  which latter are for the most part of little value.\r\n\r\n  The choice of a projection depends on the function which the map is\r\n  intended to fulfil. If the map is intended for statistical purposes to\r\n  show areas, density of population, incidence of rainfall, of disease,\r\n  distribution of wealth, &c., an _equal-area_ projection should be\r\n  chosen. In such a case an area scale should be given. At sea,\r\n  _Mercator's_ is practically the only projection used except when it is\r\n  desired to determine graphically great circle courses in great oceans,\r\n  when the _central_ projection must be employed. For conveying good\r\n  general ideas of the shape and distribution of the surface features of\r\n  continents or of a hemisphere _Clarke's perspective_ projection is the\r\n  best. For exhibiting the progress of polar exploration the _polar\r\n  equidistant_ projection should be selected. For special maps for\r\n  general use on scales of 1/1,000,000 and smaller, and for a series of\r\n  which the sheets are to fit together, the _conical, with rectified\r\n  meridians and two standard parallels_, is a good projection. For\r\n  topographical maps, in which each sheet is plotted independently and\r\n  the scale is not smaller than 1/500,000, either form of _polyconic_ is\r\n  very convenient.\r\n\r\n  The following are the projections adopted for some of the principal\r\n  official maps of the British Empire:--\r\n\r\n  _Conical, with Rectified Meridians and Two Standard Parallels._--The\r\n  1:1,000,000 Ordnance map of the United Kingdom, special maps of the\r\n  topographical section, General Staff, e.g. the 64-mile map of\r\n  Afghanistan and Persia. The 1:1,000,000 Survey of India series of\r\n  India and adjacent countries.\r\n\r\n  _Modified Conical, Equal-area (Bonne's)._--The 1 in., ½ in., ¼ in. and\r\n  1/10 in. Ordnance maps of Scotland and Ireland. The 1:800,000 map of\r\n  the Cape Colony, published by the Surveyor-General.\r\n\r\n  _Simple Polyconic and Rectangular Polyconic_ maps on scales of\r\n  1:1,000,000, 1:500,000, 1:250,000 and 1:125,000 of the topographical\r\n  section of the General Staff, including all maps on these scales of\r\n  British Africa. A rectilinear approximation to the simple polyconic is\r\n  also used for the topographical sheets of the Survey of India. The\r\n  simple polyconic is used for the 1 in. maps of the Militia Department\r\n  of Canada.\r\n\r\n  _Zenithal Projection by Balance of Errors (Airy's)._--The 10-mile to 1\r\n  in. Ordnance map of England.\r\n\r\n  _Projection by Rectangular Spheroidal Co-ordinates._--The 1:2500 and\r\n  the 6 in. Ordnance sheets of the United Kingdom, and the 1 in., ½ in.\r\n  and ¼ in.

Germain (Paris, 1865) and _A Treatise on Projections_, by T.\r\n  Craig, United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (Washington, 1882).\r\n  Both Germain and Craig (following Germain) make use of the term\r\n  _projections by development_, a term which is apt to convey the\r\n  impression that the spherical surface is developable. As this is not\r\n  the case, and since such projections are conical, it is best to avoid\r\n  the use of the term. For the history of the subject see d'Avezac,\r\n  \"Coup d'oeil historique sur la projection des cartes géographiques,\"\r\n  _Société de géographie de Paris_ (1863).\r\n\r\n  J. H. Lambert (_Beiträge zum Gebrauch der Mathematik, u.s.w._ Berlin,\r\n  1772) devised the following projections of the above list: 1, 15, 17,\r\n  and 21; his transverse cylindrical orthomorphic and the transverse\r\n  cylindrical equal-area have not been described, as they are seldom\r\n  used.

XXII.\r\n\r\n  [12] These Colchians certainly were not Egyptians. The maps referred\r\n    to may have been Assyrian.\r\n\r\n  [13] We are indebted to Strabo for nearly all we know about Greek\r\n    cartographers anterior to Ptolemy, for none of their maps has been\r\n    preserved.\r\n\r\n  [14] The gnomon was known to the Chinese in the 5th century B.C., and\r\n    reached the Greeks (Anaximander) through Babylon. Pytheas, as far as\r\n    known, was the first to utilize it for the determination of a\r\n    latitude.\r\n\r\n  [15] If, with W. Dörpfeld, we assume an Attic stadium of 200 steps\r\n    (500 ft.) to be equal to 164 metres, a degree of 700 stad. would be\r\n    equal to 114,800 metres, its actual length according to modern\r\n    measurement being 110,808 metres.\r\n\r\n  [16] _Climata_ based on the length of the longest day were introduced\r\n    by Hippocrates (_c._ 400 B.C.). _Zones_ similar to those already\r\n    drawn out for the celestial sphere were first introduced by the\r\n    Pythagoreans. Parmenides of Elea (544-430 B.C.) distinguishes five of\r\n    these zones, viz. a torrid zone, between the tropics of summer and\r\n    winter, which was uninhabitable on account of heat; two frigid zones,\r\n    uninhabitable on account of cold, and two intermediate temperate\r\n    zones.\r\n\r\n  [17] Celestial globes were made much earlier than terrestrial ones.\r\n    In the museum of Naples there is a celestial globe, 2 metres in\r\n    diameter, supported upon the shoulders of an Atlas, which E. Heis,\r\n    judging by the constellations engraved upon it (_Atlas coelestis\r\n    novus_, Bonn, 1872) judges to date from the 4th century B.C. It may\r\n    even be the work of Eudoxus (d. 386 B.C.) the famous astronomer.\r\n    Aratus of Soli in Cilicia, in his poetical _Prognostics of Stars and\r\n    the World_, refers to a globe in his possession. Archimedes, the\r\n    famous mathematician, had a celestial globe of glass, in the centre\r\n    of which was a small terrestrial globe. Hero of Alexandria (284-221\r\n    B.C.), the ingenious inventor of \"Hero's Fountain,\" is believed to\r\n    have possessed a similar apparatus. The celestial globe of Hipparchus\r\n    still existed in the Alexandrian library in the time of Ptolemy, who\r\n    himself refers to globes in his _Almagest_, as also in the\r\n    _Geography_. Leontius, who wrote a book on the manufacture of globes\r\n    (first published at Basel in 1539), is identified by Fiorini with a\r\n    bishop of Neapolis (Cyprus) of the time of Constantine III.\r\n    (642-668).\r\n\r\n  [18] The oldest MS. of Ptolemy's _Geography_ is found in the Vatopedi\r\n    monastery of Mt Athos. It dates from the 12th or 13th century and was\r\n    published by Victor Langlois in 1867. For the latest edition we are\r\n    indebted to the late Carl Müller (Paris, 1883-1906) to whom we are\r\n    likewise indebted for an edition of the _Geographi graeci minores_\r\n    (1855-1861).\r\n\r\n  [19] Facsimiles of it have been published by Desjardins(1869-1871),\r\n    by K.

(1845-1903), English business magnate,\r\nwas born on the 1st of March 1845. His father, John Maple (d. 1900), had\r\na small furniture shop in Tottenham Court Road, London, and his business\r\nbegan to develop about the time that his son entered it. The practical\r\nmanagement soon devolved on the younger Maple, under whom it attained\r\ncolossal dimensions. The firm became a limited liability company, with a\r\ncapital of two millions, in 1890, with Mr Maple as chairman. He entered\r\nparliament as Conservative member for Dulwich in 1887, was knighted in\r\n1892, and was made a baronet in 1897. He was the owner of a large stud\r\nof race-horses, and from 1885 onwards won many important races,\r\nappearing at first under the name of \"Mr Childwick.\" His public\r\nbenefactions included a hospital and a recreation ground to the city of\r\nSt Albans, near which his residence, Childwickbury, was situated, and\r\nthe rebuilding, at a cost of more than £150,000, of University College\r\nHospital, London. He died on the 24th of November 1903. His only\r\nsurviving daughter married in 1896 Baron von Eckhardstein, of the German\r\nEmbassy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPLE, in botany. The maple (O.E. _mapel-tréow, mapulder_) and sycamore\r\ntrees are species of _Acer_, of the order _Acerineae_. The genus\r\nincludes about sixty species, natives of Europe, North America and Asia,\r\nespecially the Himalayas, China and Japan. Maples are for the most part\r\ntrees with opposite, long-stalked, palmately lobed leaves. The flowers\r\nare in fascicles, appearing before the leaves as in the Norway maple, or\r\nin racemes or panicles appearing with, or later than, the leaves as in\r\nsycamore. Some of the flowers are often imperfect, the stamens or pistil\r\nbeing more or less aborted. The fruit is a two-winged \"samara.\" The\r\ngenus was represented in the Tertiary flora of Europe, when it extended\r\ninto the polar regions; nineteen species have been recorded from the\r\nMiocene strata of Oeningen in Switzerland. The common maple, _A.\r\ncampestre_, is the only species indigenous to Great Britain. This and\r\nthe sycamore were described by Gerard in 1597 (_Herball_, p. 1299), the\r\nlatter being \"a stranger to England.\" Many species have been introduced,\r\nespecially from Japan, for ornamental purposes. The following are more\r\nespecially worthy of notice.\r\n\r\n  _Acer campestre_, the common maple, is common in hedgerows, but less\r\n  often seen as a tree, when it is seldom more than 20 ft. high, though\r\n  in sheltered situations 30 ft. or more is attained. The leaves are\r\n  generally less than 2 in. across, and the five main lobes are blunter\r\n  than in the sycamore. The clusters of green flowers terminate the\r\n  young shoots and are erect; the two wings of the fruit spread almost\r\n  horizontally, and are smaller than in the sycamore. It occurs in\r\n  northern Europe, the Caucasus, and northern Asia. The wood is\r\n  excellent fuel, and makes the best charcoal. It is compact, of a fine\r\n  grain, sometimes beautifully veined, and takes a high polish. Hence it\r\n  has been celebrated from antiquity for tables, &c. The wood of the\r\n  roots is frequently knotted, and valuable for small objects of cabinet\r\n  work. The young shoots, being flexible and tough, are employed in\r\n  France as whips.\r\n\r\n  _A. pseudo-platanus_, the sycamore or great maple, is a handsome tree\r\n  of quick growth, with a smooth bark. The leaves are large, with finely\r\n  acute and serrated lobes, affording abundant shade. The flowers are\r\n  borne in long pendulous racemes, and the two wings of the fruit are\r\n  ascending. It lives from 140 to 200 years. It is found wild chiefly in\r\n  wooded mountainous situations in central Europe. The wood when young\r\n  is white, but old heartwood is yellow or brownish. Like the common\r\n  maple it is hard and takes a high polish. It is much prized by\r\n  wheelwrights, cabinet-makers, sculptors, &c., on the Continent; while\r\n  knotted roots are used for inlaying. Sugar has been obtained from the\r\n  sap of this as from other species, the most being one ounce from a\r\n  quart of sap. The latter has also been made into wine in the Highlands\r\n  of Scotland. It withstands the sea and mountain breezes better than\r\n  most other timber trees, and is often planted near farm-houses and\r\n  cottages in exposed localities for the sake of its dense foliage. Its\r\n  wood is valued in turnery for cups, bowls and pattern blocks. It\r\n  produces abundance of seeds, and is easily raised, but it requires\r\n  good and tolerably dry soil; it will not thrive on stiff clays nor on\r\n  dry sands or chalks. There are many varieties, the variegated and\r\n  cut-leaved being the most noticeable. The lobed shape of its leaf and\r\n  its dense foliage caused it to be confused with the true\r\n  sycamore--_Ficus sycamorus_--of scripture.\r\n\r\n  _A. platanoides_, the Norway maple, is met with from Norway to Italy,\r\n  Greece, and central and south Russia. It was introduced into Britain\r\n  in 1683. It is a lofty tree (from 40 to 70 ft.), resembling the\r\n  sycamore, but with yellow flowers, appearing before the leaves, and\r\n  more spreading wings to the fruit. There are several varieties. The\r\n  wood is used for the same purposes as that of the sycamore. Sugar has\r\n  been made from the sap in Norway and Sweden.\r\n\r\n  Many varieties of _A. palmatum_, generally known as _polymorphum_,\r\n  with variously laciniated and more or less coloured foliage, have been\r\n  introduced from Japan as ornamental shrubs. The branches and corolla\r\n  are purple, the fruit woolly. The foliage of the typical form is\r\n  bright green with very pointed lobes. It occurs in the central\r\n  mountains of Nippon and near Nagasaki. Beautiful varieties have been\r\n  introduced under the varietal names, _ampelopsifolium_,\r\n  _atropurpureum_, _dissectum_, &c. They are remarkable for the coppery\r\n  purple tint that pervades the leaves and young growths of some of the\r\n  varieties. Other Japanese species are _A. japonicum_, the varieties of\r\n  which are among the most handsome of small deciduous shrubs; _A.\r\n  rufinerve_, with the habit of the sycamore; _A. distylum_, bearing\r\n  leaves without lobes; _A. diabolicum_, with large plane-like leaves;\r\n  and _A. carpinifolium_, with foliage resembling that of the hornbeam.\r\n\r\n  _A. saccharinum_, a North American species, the sugar, rock, or\r\n  bird's-eye maple, was introduced in 1735. It sometimes attains to 70\r\n  or even over 100 ft., more commonly 50 to 60 ft. It is remarkable for\r\n  the whiteness of the bark. The wood is white, but acquires a rosy\r\n  tinge after exposure to light. The grain is fine and close, and when\r\n  polished has a silky lustre. The timber is used instead of oak where\r\n  the latter is scarce, and is employed for axle-trees and spokes, as\r\n  well as for Windsor chairs, &c. It exhibits two accidental forms in\r\n  the arrangement of the fibres, an undulated one like those of the\r\n  curled maple (_A. rubrum_), and one of spots, which gives the name\r\n  bird's-eye to the wood of this species. Like the curled maple, it is\r\n  used for inlaying mahogany. It is much prized for bedsteads,\r\n  writing-desks, shoe-lasts, &c. The wood forms excellent fuel and\r\n  charcoal, while the ashes are rich in alkaline principles, furnishing\r\n  a large proportion of the potash exported from Boston and New York.\r\n  Sugar is principally extracted from this species, the sap being boiled\r\n  and the syrup when reduced to a proper consistence runs into moulds to\r\n  form cakes. Trees growing in low and moist situations afford the most\r\n  sap but least sugar. A cold north-west wind, with frosty nights and\r\n  sunny days in alternation, tends to incite the flow, which is more\r\n  abundant during the day than the night. A thawing night is said to\r\n  promote the flow, and it ceases during a south-west wind and at the\r\n  approach of a storm; and so sensitive are the trees to aspect and\r\n  climatic variations that the flow of sap on the south and east side\r\n  has been noticed to be earlier than on the north and west side of the\r\n  same tree. The average quantity of sap per tree is from 12 to 24\r\n  gallons in a season.\r\n\r\n  _A. rubrum_, the red-flowering or scarlet maple, is a middle-sized\r\n  tree, and was introduced in 1656. The bright scarlet or dull red\r\n  flowers appear before the leaves in March and April. The wood, like\r\n  that of other species, is applicable to many purposes--as for the\r\n  seats of Windsor chairs, turnery, &c. The grain in very old trees is\r\n  sometimes undulated, which suggested the name of curled maple, and\r\n  gives beautiful effects of light and shade on polished surfaces. The\r\n  most constant use of curled maple is for the stocks of fowling-pieces\r\n  and rifles, as it affords toughness and strength combined with\r\n  lightness and elegance. The inner bark is dusky red. On boiling, it\r\n  yields a purple colour which with sulphate of iron affords a black\r\n  dye. The wood is inferior to that of the preceding species in strength\r\n  and as fuel. Sugar was made from the sap by the French Canadians, but\r\n  the production is only half as great as that from the sugar maple. In\r\n  Britain it is cultivated as an ornamental tree, as being conspicuous\r\n  for its flowers in spring, and for its red fruit and foliage in\r\n  autumn.\r\n\r\n  _A. macrophyllum_, a north-western American species, is a valuable\r\n  timber tree.\r\n\r\n  For a good account of the North American species see C. S. Sargent's\r\n  _Silva of North America_, vol. ii. See also under SUGAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAPU, ABRAHAM (1808-1867), Hebrew novelist. His works are chiefly\r\nhistorical romances in Hebrew. His most famous books were _The Love of\r\nZion_ and the _Transgression of Samaria_. Besides their intrinsic\r\nmerits, these novels stand high among the works which produced the\r\nromantic movement in modern Hebrew literature. Mapu's plots were\r\nsomewhat sensational, incident being more prominent than\r\ncharacterization. But underlying all was a criticism of contemporary\r\nlife. His novels made a deep impression and became instantly popular.\r\nMapu's Hebrew style is simple and classical. An English translation of\r\nthe _Love of Zion_ bears the title _Amnon, Prince and Peasant_, by F.\r\nJaffe (1887). Mapu's stories have been often translated into other\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n  See N. Slouschz, _The Renascence of Hebrew Literature_ (1909), ch. v.\r\n       (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAQQARI, or Makkari [Abu-l-'Abbas Ahmad ibn Mahommed ul-Maqqari] (c.\r\n1591-1632), Arabian historian, was born at Tlemcen in Algeria and\r\nstudied at Fez and Marrakesh, where he remained engaged in literary work\r\nuntil he made the pilgrimage to Mecca in 1618. In the following year he\r\nsettled in Cairo. In 1620 he visited Jerusalem and Damascus, and during\r\nthe next six years made the pilgrimage five times. In 1628 he was again\r\nin Damascus, where he gave a course of lectures on Bukhari's collection\r\nof _Traditions_, spoke much of the glories of Moslem Spain, and received\r\nthe impulse to write his work on this subject later. In the same year he\r\nreturned to Cairo, where he spent a year in writing his history. He was\r\njust making preparations to settle definitely in Damascus when he died\r\nin 1632.\r\n\r\n  His great work, _The Breath of Perfume from the Branch of Green\r\n  Andalusia and Memorials of its Vizier Lisan ud-Din ibn ul-Khat[-i]b_,\r\n  consists of two parts. The first is a compilation from many authors on\r\n  the description and history of Moslem Spain; it was published by\r\n  Wright, Krehl, Dozy and Dugat as _Analectes sur l'histoire et la\r\n  littérature des Arabes d'Espagne_ (Leiden, 1855-1861), and in an\r\n  abridged English translation by P. de Gayangos (London, 1840-1843).\r\n  The whole work has been published at Bulaq (1863) and Cairo (1885).\r\n\r\n  For other works of Maqqari see C. Brockelmann's _Gesch. der arabischen\r\n  Litteratur_ (Berlin, 1902), ii. 297.     (G. W. T.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAQRIZI, or MAKRIZI [Taqi ud-Din Ahmad ibn 'Ali] (1364-1442), Arabian\r\nhistorian, known as al-Maqrizi because of his ancestral connexion with\r\nMaqriz, a suburb of Baalbek, was born at Cairo and spent most of his\r\nlife in Egypt, where he was trained in the Hanifite school of law,\r\nthough later he became a Shafi'ite with an inclination to Zahirite\r\nviews. In 1385 he made the pilgrimage. For some time he was secretary in\r\na government office, and in 1399 became inspector of markets for Cairo\r\nand northern Egypt. This post he soon gave up to become preacher at the\r\nmosque of 'Amr, president of the mosque ul-Hakim, and a lecturer on\r\ntradition. In 1408 he went to Damascus to become inspector of the\r\nQalanisiyya and lecturer. Later he retired into private life at Cairo.\r\nIn 1430 he made the pilgrimage with his family and travelled for some\r\nfive years. His learning was great, his observation accurate and his\r\njudgment good, but his books are largely compilations, and he does not\r\nalways acknowledge the sources to which he is indebted. Most of his\r\nworks are concerned with Egypt. The most important is the _Mawa'iz\r\nwal-I'tibar fi dhikr ul-Hitat wal-Aihar_ (2 vols., Bulaq, 1854),\r\ntranslated into French by U. Bouriant as _Description topographique et\r\nhistorique de l'Égypte_ (Paris, 1895-1900; cf. A. R. Guest, \"A List of\r\nWriters, Books and other Authorities mentioned by El Maqrizi in his\r\n_Khitat_,\" in _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_, 1902, pp.\r\n103-125). Of his _History of the Fatimites_ an extract was published by\r\nJ. G. L. Kosegarten in his _Chrestomathia_ (Leipzig, 1828), pp. 115-123;\r\nthe _History of the Ayyubit and Mameluke Rulers_ has been translated\r\ninto French by E. Quatremère (2 vols., Paris, 1837-1845). Maqrizi began\r\na large work called the _Muqaffa_, a cyclopaedia of Egyptian biography\r\nin alphabetic order. It was intended to be in 80 volumes, but only 16\r\nwere written. Three autograph volumes exist in MS. in Leiden, and one in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n  Among smaller works published are the _Mahommedan Coinage_ (ed. O. G.\r\n  Tychsen, Rostock, 1797; French translation by S. de Sacy, Paris,\r\n  1797); _Arab Weights and Measures_ (ed. Tychsen, Rostock, 1800); the\r\n  _Arabian Tribes that migrated to Egypt_ (ed. F. Wüstenfeld, Göttingen,\r\n  1847); the _Account of Hadhramaut_ (ed. P. B. Noskowyj, Bonn, 1866);\r\n  the _Strife between the Bani Umayya and the Bani Hashim_ (ed G. Vos,\r\n  Leiden, 1888), and the _Moslems in Abyssinia_ (ed. F. T. Rink, Leiden,\r\n  1790). For Maqrizi's life see the quotations from contemporary\r\n  biographies in S. de Sacy's _Chrestomathie arabe_ (2nd ed., Paris,\r\n  1826), ii. 112 seq., and for other works still in MS. C.

Mar, one of the ancient divisions or provinces of\r\nScotland, comprised the larger portion of Aberdeenshire, extending from\r\nnorth of the Don southward to the Mounth. Like other such districts, it\r\nwas in Celtic times under the rule of a _mormaer_. In the 12th century\r\nhis place was taken by an earl, but no definite succession of earls\r\nappears till the 13th century, nor is any connexion established between\r\nthem and the _mormaers_. From the middle of the 13th century the earls\r\nwere recognized as among \"the seven earls of Scotland\" and held a great\r\nposition. Earl Gratney (fl. c. 1300) married a sister of (King) Robert\r\nBruce, who brought him the lordship of Garioch and castle of Kildrummy,\r\nwhich she held against the earl of Athole, an ally of the English\r\n(1335). Their son Donald was made regent in July 1332, but was\r\ndisastrously defeated and slain at Dupplin next month. His daughter and\r\neventual heir, Margaret, brought the earldom to her husband, William,\r\nearl of Douglas, and on the accession of her daughter Isabél a troublous\r\ntime followed.\r\n\r\nWhile she was living as a widow at her castle of Kildrummy, it was\r\nstormed by Alexander Stewart, a bastard, who forced her to execute a\r\ncharter (August 12, 1404) settling the reversion to the earldom on\r\nhimself and his heirs. This act she revoked by a charter of the 19th of\r\nSeptember 1404, which cannot now be found; but on marrying him, on the\r\n9th of December 1404, she granted him the earldom for life, the king\r\nconfirming this on the 21st of June 1405. After her death in 1408 the\r\nearl played a great part, commanding the royal forces at the battle of\r\nHarlaw, when the Lord of the Isles was defeated in 1411, and afterwards\r\nacting as warden of the Marches. In 1426 he resigned the earldom to the\r\nCrown, the king granting it by a fresh creation to him and certain\r\nheirs, with reversion to the Crown. On the earl's death in 1435 the\r\nearldom was claimed by Robert, Lord Erskine, as heir of Gratney, earl of\r\nMar, through a daughter; but the Crown claimed as reversionary under the\r\ncreation of 1426. A long struggle followed, till in 1457 James II.\r\nobtained from a justiciary court at Aberdeen a recognition of the\r\nCrown's right to the earldom and its lands, and shortly after bestowed\r\nthem on his son John as earl of Mar and Garioch. He died unmarried in\r\n1479, and in 1483 his elder brother Alexander duke of Albany received\r\nthe earldom, but was soon forfeited. James III. created his son John\r\nearl of Mar and Garioch in 1486, and after his death unmarried in 1503,\r\nJames IV. alienated to Lord Elphinstone (1507-1510) many of the Mar\r\nlands, including Kildrummy. The title was not revived till 1562, when\r\nJames Stewart, earl of Murray, held it for a few months.\r\n\r\nIn 1565 John, Lord Erskine, succeeded in getting returned heir to the\r\nearldom, and shortly after (June 23, 1565) Queen Margaret restored the\r\ncharter to him and his heirs \"all and hail the said earldom of Mar.\" As\r\nearl he took part against the queen in 1567, and in 1571 was made regent\r\nof Scotland, which post he retained till his death (1572). His son, earl\r\nJohn (c. 1558-1634), played a great part in the history of the family.\r\nHis great achievement was the recovery of the Mar estates, alienated by\r\nthe Crown during the long period that his family had been out of\r\npossession, including Kildrummy, the \"head\" of the earldom. It was in\r\nhis time that the precedence of the earldom (see below) was settled.\r\nJohn, the next earl (c. 1585-1654) was a Royalist, as was his son John\r\n(d. 1668), much to the injury of the family fortune, which was further\r\nimpaired by the attachment of the family, after the Revolution, to the\r\nStuarts. His son Charles (1650-1689) was arrested by the government just\r\nbefore his death (1689), and the next earl, John (1675-1732), a\r\nprominent Jacobite (see below), was attainted, the earldom remaining\r\nunder forfeiture for 108 years; by the Old Pretender he was created duke\r\nof Mar.\r\n\r\nAlloa and other Erskine estates of the attainted earl were repurchased\r\nfor the family, and descended to John Francis Erskine (1741-1825), his\r\nheir-male, who was also his heir of line through his daughter. To him,\r\nin his eighty-third year, as grandson and lineal representative of the\r\nattainted earl, the earldom was restored by act of parliament in 1824.\r\nHis grandson, who succeeded him in 1828, inherited the earldom of Kellie\r\n(1619) and other Erskine dignities by decision of 1835. At his death in\r\n1866, his earldom of Mar was the subject of rival claims, and the right\r\nto the succession was not determined till 1875. His estates passed to\r\nhis cousin and heir-male, who succeeded to his earldom of Kellie and\r\nclaimed \"the honour and dignity of earl of Mar.\" But the latter was also\r\nclaimed by a Mr Goodeve, whose father had married the late earl's eldest\r\nsister, and who assumed the title. It was not suggested that the late\r\nearl had more than one earldom of Mar, but Lord Kellie claimed it as\r\ndescendible to heirs-male under a creation by Queen Mary, and Mr Goodeve\r\nas descendible to heirs of line under an earlier creation. The House of\r\nLords decided (Feb. 25, 1875) that Lord Kellie was entitled to the\r\nearldom as having been created by Queen Mary in 1565, with a limitation\r\nwhich must be presumed to be to heirs-male of the body. This decision\r\ngave great dissatisfaction, but was described as \"final, right or wrong,\r\nand not to be questioned\" by Lord Selborne and the lord chancellor in\r\n1877, and Lord Kellie was thenceforth recognized as holding the earldom\r\non the Union Roll, the only one known, though Mr Goodeve continued to\r\nassume the title. The Lords' decision could not be reversed, but in\r\n1885, after much agitation, a means was found of evading it in practice\r\nby the \"Earldom of Mar Restitution Act.\" By \"an equivocation on the\r\nfacts of the case,\" it was recited that \"doubts may exist whether the\r\nsaid ancient honour, dignity, and title of peerage of earl of Mar ...\r\nwas or was not ... by any lawful means surrendered or merged in the\r\nCrown\" before 1565, and that the House of Lords had decided that Queen\r\nMary's known charter of 1565 applied only to lands and \"did not operate\r\nor extend to restore\" the peerage dignity, and enacted that \"John\r\nFrancis Erskine Goodeve Erskine\" (which last name the claimant had\r\nadded) should be \"restored to\" the ancient earldom. His previous\r\nassumption of the title was thus rejected as invalid, but from the\r\npassing of the act two earldoms of Mar were in existence, that of Lord\r\nKellie being confirmed and allowed the precedence of 1565, while the\r\nrestored earldom was allowed that of the dignity on the Union Roll, the\r\nonly one known till then. This precedence had been assigned to it by the\r\nDecreet of Ranking (1606), and assigns to it an origin in 1404 (or, as\r\nsome say, 1395). It is frequently, but absurdly, stated to have been\r\n\"created before 1014,\" and wrongly spoken of as the Premier Scottish\r\nEarldom (see EARL). A barony of Garioch is also wrongly said to be\r\nannexed to it, but the title is used by the earl's eldest son in default\r\nof any other.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--_Minutes of Evidence_, 1875 and 1885; Riddell's\r\n  _Peerage and Consistorial Law_; Skene, _Celtic Scotland_; Lord\r\n  Crawford's _Earldom of Mar in Sunshine and Shade_; articles by G.\r\n  Burnett (Lyon), Sir H.

(J. H. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAR, JOHN ERSKINE, 1ST OR 6TH EARL OF (d. 1572), regent of Scotland, was\r\na son of John, 5th Lord Erskine (d. 1552), who was guardian of King\r\nJames V., and afterwards of Mary Queen of Scots. The younger John, who\r\nsucceeded his father as 6th Lord Erskine in 1552, joined the religious\r\nreformers, but he was never very ardent in the cause, although he\r\nsubscribed the letter asking Knox to return to Scotland in 1557. The\r\ncustody of Edinburgh Castle was in his hands, and during the struggle\r\nbetween the regent, Mary of Lorraine, and the lords of the Congregation\r\nhe appears to have acted consistently in the interests of peace. When\r\nMary Stuart returned to Scotland in 1561 Lord Erskine was a member of\r\nher council, he favoured her marriage with Lord Darnley, and his wife,\r\nAnnabella Murray, called by Knox a \"verray Jesabell,\" was a frequent\r\ncompanion of the queen. In 1565 Erskine was granted the earldom of Mar\r\n(see above). As guardian of James, afterwards King James VI., he\r\nprevented the young prince from falling into the hands of Bothwell, and\r\nwhen the Scottish nobles rose against Mary and Both well, Mar was one of\r\ntheir leaders; he took part in the government of Scotland during Mary's\r\nimprisonment at Lochleven, and also after her subsequent abdication. In\r\nSeptember 1571 he was chosen regent of Scotland, but he was overshadowed\r\nand perhaps slighted by the earl of Morton, and he died at Stirling on\r\nthe 29th of October 1572.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAR, JOHN ERSKINE, 2ND OR 7TH EARL OF (c. 1558-1634), Scottish\r\npolitician, was the only son of the preceding. Together with King James\r\nVI. he was educated by George Buchanan. After attaining his majority he\r\nwas nominally the guardian of the young king, who was about seven years\r\nhis junior, and who lived with him at Stirling; but he was in reality a\r\npuppet in the hands of the regent, the earl of Morton; and he lost power\r\nand position when Morton was imprisoned. He was concerned in the seizure\r\nof James VI. in 1582 (a plot known as the raid of Ruthven); but when\r\nJames escaped from his new custodians the earl fled into the west of\r\nScotland. Then leaving his hiding-place Mar seized Stirling Castle,\r\nwhereupon James marched against him, and he took refuge in England.\r\nQueen Elizabeth interceded for him, but in vain, and after some futile\r\ncommunications between the governments of England and Scotland Mar and\r\nhis friends gathered an army, entered the presence of the king at\r\nStirling, and were soon in supreme authority (1585). Mar was restored to\r\nhis lands and titles. Henceforward he stood high in the royal favour; he\r\nbecame governor of Edinburgh Castle and was made tutor to James's son,\r\nPrince Henry, and for his second wife he married Mary, daughter of Esmé\r\nStewart, duke of Lennox. In 1601 the earl was sent as envoy to London;\r\nhere Elizabeth assured him that James should be her successor, and his\r\nmission was conducted with tact and prudence. Having joined the English\r\nprivy council Mar was created Lord Cardross in 1610; he was a member of\r\nthe Court of High Commission and was lord high treasurer of Scotland\r\nfrom 1615 to 1630. He died at Stirling on the 14th of December 1634.\r\nJohn (c. 1585-1654), his only son by his first wife, succeeded to his\r\nearldom; by his second wife he had five sons, among them being James (d.\r\n1640), earl of Buchan; Henry (d. 1628), whose son David (d. 1671)\r\nsucceeded to the barony of Cardross; and Charles, the ancestor of the\r\nearls of Rosslyn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAR, JOHN ERSKINE, 6TH OR 11TH EARL OF (1675-1732), Scottish Jacobite,\r\nwas the eldest son of Charles, the 5th earl (1650-1689), from whom he\r\ninherited estates which were heavily loaded with debt. He was associated\r\nwith the party favourable to the English government; he was one of the\r\ncommissioners for the Union, and was made a Scottish secretary of state,\r\nbecoming after the Union of 1707 a representative peer for Scotland,\r\nkeeper of the signet and a privy councillor. In 1713 Mar was made an\r\nEnglish secretary of state by the Tories, but he seems to have been\r\nequally ready to side with the Whigs, and in 1714 he assured the new\r\nking, George I., of his loyalty. However, like the other Tories, he was\r\ndeprived of his office, and in August 1715 he went in disguise to\r\nScotland and placed himself at the head of the adherents of James\r\nEdward, the Old Pretender. Meeting many Highland chieftains at Aboyne he\r\navowed an earnest desire for the independence of Scotland, and at\r\nBraemar on the 6th of September 1715 he proclaimed James VIII. king of\r\nScotland, England, France and Ireland. Gradually the forces under his\r\ncommand were augmented, but as a general he was a complete failure.\r\nPrecious time was wasted at Perth, a feigned attack on Stirling was\r\nresultless, and he could give little assistance to the English\r\nJacobites. At Sheriffmuir, where a battle was fought in November 1715,\r\nMar's forces largely outnumbered those of his opponent, Archibald\r\nCampbell, afterwards 3rd duke of Argyll; but no bravery could atone for\r\nthe signal incompetence displayed by the earl, and the fight was\r\nvirtually a decisive defeat for the Jacobites. Mar then met James Edward\r\nat Fetteresso; the cause however was lost, and the prince and the earl\r\nfled to France. Mar sought to interest foreign powers in the cause of\r\nthe Stuarts; but in the course of time he became thoroughly distrusted\r\nby the Jacobites. In 1721 he accepted a pension of £3500 a year from\r\nGeorge I., and in the following year his name was freely mentioned in\r\nconnexion with the trial of Bishop Atterbury, whom it was asserted that\r\nMar had betrayed. This charge may perhaps be summarized as not proven.\r\nAt the best his conduct was highly imprudent, and in 1724 he left the\r\nPretender's service. His later years were spent in Paris and at\r\nAix-la-Chapelle, where he died in May 1732.\r\n\r\nMar, who was known as \"bobbing John,\" married for his second wife,\r\nFrances (d. 1761), daughter of the 1st duke of Kingston, and was thus a\r\nbrother-in-law of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. He had been attainted in\r\n1716, and his only son, Thomas, Lord Erskine, died childless in March\r\n1766.\r\n\r\nMar's brother, JAMES ERSKINE (1679-1754), was educated as a lawyer and\r\nbecame lord justice clerk of the Court of Session and Lord Grange in\r\n1710. He took no part in the rising of 1715, although there is little\r\ndoubt that at times he was in communication with the Jacobites; but was\r\nrather known for his piety and for his sympathy with the Presbyterians.\r\nHe is more famous, however, owing to the story of his wife's\r\ndisappearance. This lady, Rachel Chicely, was a woman of disordered\r\nintellect; probably with reason she suspected her husband of infidelity,\r\nand after some years of unhappiness Grange arranged a plan for her\r\nseizure. In January 1732 she was conveyed with great secrecy from\r\nEdinburgh to the island of Hesker, thence to St Kilda, where she\r\nremained for about ten years, thence she was taken to Assynt in\r\nSutherland, and finally to Skye. To complete the idea that she was dead\r\nher funeral was publicly celebrated, but she survived until May 1745.\r\nMeanwhile in 1734 Grange had resigned his judgeship and had become an\r\nEnglish member of parliament; here he was a bitter opponent of Sir\r\nRobert Walpole. He died in London on the 20th of January 1754.\r\n\r\n  See the _Journal of the Earl of Mar_ (1716); R. Patten, _History of\r\n  the late Rebellion_ (1717); and A. Lang, _History of Scotland_, vol.\r\n  iv. (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARA, GERTRUD ELISABETH (1749-1833), German singer, was born at Cassel,\r\nthe daughter of a poor musician named Schmeling. From him she learnt the\r\nviolin, and while still a child her playing at the fair at Frankfort was\r\nso remarkable that money was collected to provide for her. She was\r\nhelped by influential friends, and studied under Hillel at Leipzig for\r\nfive years, proving to be endowed with a wonderful soprano voice. She\r\nbegan to sing in public in 1771, and was soon recognized as the greatest\r\nsinger that Germany had produced. She was permanently engaged for the\r\nPrussian Court, but her marriage to a debauched violinist named Mara\r\ncreated difficulties, and in 1780 she was released. After singing at\r\nVienna, Munich and elsewhere, she appeared in Paris in 1782, where her\r\nrivalry with the singer Todi developed into a regular faction. In 1784\r\nshe went to London, and continued to appear there with great success,\r\nwith visits at intervals to Italy and to Paris till 1802, when for some\r\nyears she retired to Russia. She visited England again in 1819, but then\r\nabandoned the stage. She went to Livonia, and died on the 20th of\r\nJanuary 1833 at Revel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARABOUT (the French form of the Arab. _murabit_, \"one who pickets his\r\nhorse on a hostile frontier\"; cf. Portug. _marabute_; Span. _morabito_),\r\nin Mahommedan religion a hermit or devotee. The word is derived from\r\n_ribat_, a fortified frontier station. To such stations pious men betook\r\nthem to win religious merit in war against the infidel; their leisure\r\nwas spent in devotion, and the habits of the convent superseded those of\r\nthe camp (see M'G. De Slane in _Jour. As._, 1842, i. 168; Dozy, _Suppl._\r\ni. 502). Thus _ribat_ came to mean a religious house or hospice\r\n(_zawiya_). The great sphere of the marabouts is North Africa. There it\r\nwas that the community formed by Yahya b. Ibrahim and the doctor\r\nAbdullah developed into the conquering empire of the Murabits, or, as\r\nChristian writers call them, the ALMORAVIDES (q.v.), and there still,\r\namong the Berbers, the marabouts enjoy extraordinary influence, being\r\nesteemed as living saints and mediators. They are liberally supported by\r\nalms, direct all popular assemblies, and have a decisive voice in\r\nintertribal quarrels and all matters of consequence. On their death\r\ntheir sanctity is transferred to their tombs (also called marabouts),\r\nwhere chapels are erected and gifts and prayers offered. The marabouts\r\ntook a prominent part in the resistance offered to the French by the\r\nAlgerian Moslems; and they have been similarly active in\r\npolitico-religious movements in Tunisia and Tripoli.\r\n\r\n  See L. Rinn, _Marabouts et Khouan_ (Algiers, 1884); and the article\r\n  DERVISH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARACAIBO, a large lake of western Venezuela, extending southward from\r\nthe Gulf of Venezuela, into which it opens through a long neck, or\r\nstrait, obstructed at its mouth by islands and bars, and having a large\r\ndrainage basin bounded on the W. by the Eastern Cordillera, on the S.E.\r\nby the Cordillera de Merida, and on the E. by a low range of mountains\r\nextending N. by W. from Trujillo to the coast. The lake is roughly\r\nquadrangular in shape, and extends from the 9th to the 11th parallel of\r\nS. lat. and from the 71st to the 72nd meridian. It opens into the Gulf\r\nthrough 13 channels, the depth on the bar in the main channel ranging\r\nfrom 7 ft. at low water to 12 ft. at high water. Inside the bar the\r\ndepth is about 30 ft., and the lake is navigable for vessels of large\r\nsize. It receives the waters of many rivers, principally on its west and\r\nsouth sides, the largest of which are the Catatumbo and Zulia,\r\nEscalante, Chanudo, Ceniza, Sant'Ana, Negro, Apan and Palmar. The first\r\nthree have navigable channels for river steamers. There are a number of\r\nsmall lakes near Lake Maracaibo's southern and western margins, the\r\nlargest of which is the Laguna de Zulia. The heavy rainfall on the\r\neastern slopes of the Eastern Cordillera, which is said to exceed 86 in.\r\nper annum, is responsible for the great volume of water discharged into\r\nthe lake. The average annual precipitation over the whole basin is said\r\nto be 70 in. In the upper half of the lake the water is sweet, but below\r\nthat, where the tidal influence is stronger, it becomes brackish. The\r\nonly port of consequence on the lake is Maracaibo, but there are small\r\nports at its upper end which are in direct communication with the inland\r\ncities of Trujillo, Merida and San Cristobal. The Catatumbo River, which\r\nenters from the west near the north end of the lake, and its principal\r\ntributary, the Zulia, are navigable as far as Villamizar, in Colombia,\r\nand afford an excellent transportation route for the coffee and other\r\nproducts of Santander.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARACAIBO (sometimes MARACAYBO), a city and seaport of Venezuela and\r\ncapital of the state of Zulia (formerly Maracaibo), on the west shore of\r\nthe broad channel or neck which connects Lake Maracaibo with the Gulf of\r\nVenezuela, or Maracaibo, about 25 m. from the mouth of the channel\r\nopening into the latter. Pop. (1889), 34,284; (1905), 49,817; there is a\r\nconsiderable German element in the vicinity. The best residential\r\nsuburb, Haticos, extends along the lake shore toward the south. The city\r\nis provided with tramways, telephone service and electric lighting, but\r\nthe water supply and drainage are inferior. The most important buildings\r\nare the executive's residence, the legislative chambers, the municipal\r\nhall, the Baralt theatre, the prison, the market, a hospital and six\r\nchurches. The city also has a school of arts, a public library, and a\r\npublic garden. In colonial times Maracaibo had a famous Jesuits' college\r\n(now gone) and was one of the educational centres of Spanish America;\r\nthe city now has a national college and a nautical school. The\r\nindustries include shipbuilding, and the manufacture of saddlery and\r\nother leather products, bricks and tile, rum, beer, chocolate and\r\ncoco-nut oil. Maracaibo is chiefly known, however, as one of the\r\nprincipal commercial centres and shipping ports on the northern coast of\r\nSouth America. The bar at the entrance to Maracaibo channel does not\r\nadmit vessels drawing more than 12 ft., but there is a depth of 30 ft.\r\ninside and near the city. Steam communication is maintained on the\r\nCatatumbo and Zulia rivers to Villamizar, and on the Escalante to Santa\r\nCruz. The principal exports from Maracaibo are coffee, hides and skins,\r\ncabinet and dye-woods, cocoa, and mangrove bark, to which may be added\r\ndividivi, sugar, copaiba, gamela and hemp straw for paper-making, and\r\nfruits. In 1906, 26% of the coffee exports was of Colombian origin.\r\n\r\nMaracaibo was founded in 1571 by Alonso Pacheco, who gave it the name\r\nNueva Zamora. Up to 1668 the entrepôt for the inland settlements was a\r\nstation named Gibraltar at the head of the lake, but the destruction of\r\nthat station by pirates in that year transferred this valuable trade to\r\nMaracaibo. The city did not figure actively in the War of Independence\r\nuntil 1821 (Jan. 28), when the province declared its independence and\r\nsought an alliance with Colombia. This brought to an end the armistice\r\nbetween Bolívar and Morillo, and thenceforward the city experienced all\r\nthe changing fortunes of war until its final capture by the\r\nrevolutionists in 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARAGHA, a town of Persia in the province of Azerbaijan, on the Safi\r\nRiver, in 37° 23´ N., 46° 16´ E., 80 m. from Tabriz. Pop. about 16,000.\r\nIt is pleasantly situated in a narrow valley running nearly north and\r\nsouth at the eastern extremity of a well-cultivated plain opening\r\ntowards Lake Urmia, which lies 18 m. to the west. The town is\r\nencompassed by a high wall ruined in many places, and has four gates.\r\nTwo stone bridges in good condition, said to have been constructed\r\nduring the reign of Hulaku Khan (1256-1265), and since then several\r\ntimes repaired, lead over the Safi River on the western side of the\r\ntown. The place is surrounded by extensive vineyards and orchards, all\r\nwell watered by canals led from the river, and producing great\r\nquantities of fruit for exportation to Russia. On a hill west of the\r\ntown are the remains of a famous observatory (_rasad_) constructed under\r\nthe direction of the great astronomer Nasr-ud-din of Tus. The hills west\r\nof the town consist of horizontal strata of sandstone covered with\r\nirregular pieces of basalt and the top of the hill on which the\r\nobservatory stood was made level by taking away the basalt. The\r\nbuilding, which no doubt served as a citadel as well, enclosed a space\r\nof 380 yds. by 150, and the foundations of the walls were 4½ to 5 ft. in\r\nthickness. The marble, which is known throughout Persia as Maragha\r\nmarble, is a travertine obtained at the village of Dashkesen (Turkish\r\nfor \"stone-breakers\") about 30 m. north-west from Maragha. It is\r\ndeposited from water, which bubbles up from a number of springs in the\r\nform of horizontal layers, which at first are thin crusts and can easily\r\nbe broken, but gradually solidify and harden into blocks with a\r\nthickness of 7 to 8 in. It is a singularly beautiful substance, being of\r\npink, greenish, or milk-white colour, streaked with reddish,\r\ncopper-coloured veins. An analysis of the marble gave the following\r\nresult: calcium carbonate, 90.93; magnesium, .75; iron, 1.37; manganese,\r\n4.34; calcium sulphate, 2.30; calcium phosphate, .24 (R. T. Günther,\r\n_Geog. Journ._ xiv. 517).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARANHÃO, or MARANHAM (Span. _Marañon_, the name given to the upper\r\nAmazon), a northern state of Brazil, bounded N. by the Atlantic, E. and\r\nS.E. by Piauhy, S.W. and W. by Goyaz and Pará. Area, 177,569 sq. m.;\r\npop. (1890), 430,854; (1900), 499,308. The coastal zone and the\r\nnorth-west corner of the state belong to the Amazon valley region, being\r\na heavily forested plain traversed by numerous rivers. The eastern and\r\nsouthern parts, however, belong to the lower terraces of the great\r\nBrazilian plateau, broken by eroded river-courses between which are high\r\nopen plains. There are no true mountain ranges in Maranhão, those\r\nindicated on the maps being only plateau escarpments marking either its\r\nnorthern margin or the outlines of river valleys. The climate is hot,\r\nand the year is divided into a wet and dry season, extreme humidity\r\nbeing characteristic of the former. The heat, however, is greatly\r\nmodified on the coast by the south-east trade winds, and the climate is\r\ngenerally considered healthy, though beri-beri and eruptive diseases are\r\ncommon on the coast. The coast itself is broken and dangerous, there\r\nbeing many small indentations, which are usually masked by islands or\r\nshoals. The largest of these are the Bay of Tury-assú, facing which is\r\nthe island of São João, and several others of small size, and the\r\ncontiguous bays of São Marcos and São José, between which is the large\r\nisland of Maranhão. The rivers of the state all flow northward to the\r\nAtlantic and a majority of them have navigable channels. The Parnahyba\r\nforms the eastern boundary of Maranhão, but it has one large tributary,\r\nthe Balsas, entirely within the state. A part of the western boundary is\r\nformed by the Tocantins, and another part by the Gurupy, which separates\r\nthe state from Pará. The principal rivers of the state are the\r\nMaracassumé and Tury-assú, the Mearim and its larger tributaries (the\r\nPindaré, Grajahú, Flôres and Corda) which discharge into the Bay of São\r\nMarcos, and the Itapicurú and Monim which discharge into the Bay of São\r\nJosé. Like the Amazon, the Mearim has a _pororoca_ or bore in its lower\r\nchannel, which greatly interferes with navigation. There are a number of\r\nsmall lakes in the state, some of which are, apparently, merely\r\nreservoirs for the annual floods of the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe principal industries of Maranhão are agricultural, the river valleys\r\nand coastal zone being highly fertile and being devoted to the\r\ncultivation of sugar-cane, cotton, rice, coffee, tobacco, mandioca and a\r\ngreat variety of fruits. The southern highlands, however, are devoted to\r\nstock-raising, which was once an important industry. Troublesome\r\ninsects, vampire bats, and the failure to introduce new blood into the\r\ndegenerated herds, are responsible for its decline. Agriculture has also\r\ngreatly declined, the state producing for export only a comparatively\r\nsmall quantity of cotton, rice, sugar and _aguardiente_. Besides São\r\nLuiz, the capital of the state, the principal towns, with the population\r\nof their municipal districts in 1890, are: Caxias (19,443), Alcantara\r\n(4730), Carolina (7266), Grajahú (11,704), Tury-assú (8983) and Viana\r\n(9965).\r\n\r\nThe coast of Maranhão was first discovered by Pinzon in 1500, but it was\r\nincluded in the Portuguese grant of captaincies in 1534. The first\r\nEuropean settlement, however, was made by a French trading expedition\r\nunder Jacques Riffault, of Dieppe, in 1594, who lost two of his three\r\nvessels in the vicinity of the island of Maranhão, and left a part of\r\nhis men on that island when he returned home. Subsequently Daniel de la\r\nRivardière was sent to report on the place, and was then commissioned by\r\nthe French crown to found a colony on the island; this was done in 1612.\r\nThe French were expelled by the Portuguese in 1615, and the Dutch held\r\nthe island from 1641 to 1644. In 1621 Ceará, Maranhão and Pará were\r\nunited and called the \"Estado do Maranhão,\" which was made independent\r\nof the southern captaincies. Ceará was subsequently detached, but the\r\n\"state\" of Maranhão remained independent until 1774, when it again\r\nbecame subject to the colonial administration of Brazil. Maranhão did\r\nnot join in the declaration of independence of 1822, but in the\r\nfollowing year the Portuguese were driven out by Admiral Lord Cochrane\r\nand the province became a part of the new empire of Brazil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARANO (accursed or banned), a term applied to Jewish Christians in\r\nSpain. Converted to Roman Catholicism under compulsion, these \"New\r\nChristians\" often continued to observe Jewish rites in their homes, as\r\nthe Inquisition records attest. It was in fact largely due to the\r\nMaranos that the Spanish Inquisition was founded. The Maranos made rapid\r\nstrides in prosperity, and \"accumulated honours, wealth and popular\r\nhatred\" (Lea, _History of the Spanish Inquisition_, i. 125). This was\r\none of the causes that led to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in\r\n1492. Maranos emigrated to various countries, but many remained in the\r\nPeninsula. Subsequently distinguished individuals left home for more\r\ntolerant lands. The Jewish community in London was refounded by Maranos\r\nin the first half of the 17th century. Hamburg commerce, too, owed much\r\nto the enterprise of Portuguese Maranos. In Amsterdam many Maranos found\r\nasylum; Spinoza was descended from such a family. There are still\r\nremnants of Marano families in Portugal.\r\n\r\n  See Lea, _loc. cit._ and elsewhere; see index s.v. \"New Christian\";\r\n  Graetz, _History of the Jews_, Eng. trans. see index s.v. \"Marranos\";\r\n  M. Kayserling, in _Jewish Encyclopedia_, viii. 318 seq.; and for the\r\n  present day _Jewish Quarterly Review_, xv. 251 seq.     (I. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARASH (anc. _Germanicia-Marasion_), the chief town of a sanjak of the\r\nsame name in the Aleppo vilayet, altitude 2600 ft. situated E. of the\r\nJihan river, at the foot of Mt Taurus. The sanjak lies almost wholly in\r\nMt Taurus, and includes the Armenian town of Zeitun. Marash is\r\nprosperous, and has a large trade in Kurd carpets and embroideries. The\r\nclimate is good, except in summer. Of the population (50,000) about half\r\nare Turkish-speaking Armenians. There are a college, church and schools\r\nbelonging to the American mission, a native Protestant church and a\r\nJesuit establishment. The site, which lies near the mouths of the three\r\nmain passes over the eastern Taurus--viz. those descending from Geuksun\r\n(Cocysus), Albistan-Yarpuz (Arabissus), and Malatia (Melitene)--is shown\r\nto have had early importance, not only by the occurrence of _Marasi_ in\r\nAssyrian inscriptions, but by the discovery of several \"Hittite\"\r\nmonuments on the spot. These, said to have been unearthed, for the most\r\npart, near the Kirk Geuz spring above the modern town, are now in\r\nConstantinople and America, and include an inscribed lion, once built\r\ninto the wall of the citadel known in the middle ages as al-Marwani, and\r\nseveral _stelae_. No more is known of the place until it appears as\r\nGermanicia-Caesarea, striking imperial coins with the head of L. Verus\r\n(middle of 2nd cent. A.D.). The identification of Marash with Germanicia\r\nhas been disputed, but successfully defended by Sir W. M. Ramsay; and it\r\nis borne out by the Armenian name _Kermanig_, which has been given to\r\nthe place since at least the 12th century. Before the Roman period\r\nMarash doubtless shared the fortunes of the Seleucid kingdom of\r\nCommagene. _Germanicia-Marasion_ played a great part in Byzantine border\r\nwarfare: Heraclius was there in A.D. 640; but before 700 it had passed\r\ninto Saracen hands and been rebuilt by the caliph Moawiya. During the\r\n8th and 9th centuries, when the direct pass from Cocysus came into\r\nmilitary use, Marasion (the older name had returned into general use)\r\nwas often the Byzantine objective and was more than once retaken; but\r\nafter 770, when Mansur incorporated it in \"Palestine\" it remained\r\ndefinitely in Moslem power and was refortified by Harun-al-Rashid. It\r\nwas seized by the crusaders after their march across Mt Taurus, A.D.\r\n1097, became an important town of Lesser Armenia and was taken by the\r\nSeljuks in 1147. In the 16th century it was added to the Osmanli Empire\r\nby Selim I. Marash passed with the rest of Syria into Egyptian hands in\r\n1832, and in 1839 received fugitives from the defeat of Nizib, among\r\nwhom was Moltke. Ibrahim Pasha was encamped near it when directed by his\r\nfather, at the bidding of the powers, to stay his further advance. Since\r\nits reversion to Ottoman power (1840) the history of Marash has been\r\nvaried only by Armenian troubles, largely connected with the fortunes of\r\nZeitun, for the reduction of which place it has more than once been used\r\nas a base. There was less disturbance there in 1895-1896 than in other\r\nnorth Syrian towns.     (D. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARAT, JEAN PAUL (1743-1793), French revolutionary leader, eldest child\r\nof Jean Paul Marat, a native of Cagliari in Sardinia, and Louise Cabrol\r\nof Geneva, was born at Boudry, in the principality of Neuchâtel, on the\r\n24th of May 1743. His father was a designer, who had abandoned his\r\ncountry and his religion, and married a Swiss Protestant. On his\r\nmother's death in 1759 Marat set out on his travels, and spent two years\r\nat Bordeaux in the study of medicine, whence he moved to Paris, where he\r\nmade use of his knowledge of his two favourite sciences, optics and\r\nelectricity, to subdue an obstinate disease of the eyes. After some\r\nyears in Paris he went to Holland, and then on to London, where he\r\npractised his profession. In 1773 he made his first appearance as an\r\nauthor with a _Philosophical Essay on Man_. The book shows a wonderful\r\nknowledge of English, French, German, Italian and Spanish philosophers,\r\nand directly attacks Helvetius, who had in his _De l'esprit_ declared a\r\nknowledge of science unnecessary for a philosopher. Marat declares that\r\nphysiology alone can solve the problems of the connexion between soul\r\nand body, and proposes the existence of a nervous fluid as the true\r\nsolution. In 1774 he published _The Chains of Slavery_, which was\r\nintended to influence constituencies to return popular members, and\r\nreject the king's friends. Its author declared later that it procured\r\nhim an honorary membership of the patriotic societies of Carlisle,\r\nBerwick and Newcastle. He remained devoted to his profession, and in\r\n1775 published in London a little _Essay on Gleets_, and in Amsterdam a\r\nFrench translation of the first two volumes of his _Essay on Man_. In\r\nthis year he visited Edinburgh, and on the recommendation of certain\r\nEdinburgh physicians was made an M. D. of St Andrews. On his return to\r\nLondon he published an _Enquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of a\r\nSingular Disease of the Eyes_, with a dedication to the Royal Society.\r\nIn the same year there appeared the third volume of the French edition\r\nof the _Essay on Man_, which reached Ferney, and exasperated Voltaire,\r\nby its onslaught on Helvetius, into a sharp attack which only made the\r\nyoung author more conspicuous. His fame as a clever doctor was now\r\ngreat, and on the 24th of June 1777, the comte d'Artois, afterwards\r\nCharles X. of France, made him by brevet physician to his guards with\r\n2000 livres a year and allowances.\r\n\r\nMarat was soon in great request as a court doctor among the aristocracy;\r\nand even Brissot, in his _Mémoires_, admits his influence in the\r\nscientific world of Paris. The next years were much occupied with\r\nscientific work, especially the study of heat, light and electricity, on\r\nwhich he presented memoirs to the Académie des Sciences, but the\r\nacademicians were horrified at his temerity in differing from Newton,\r\nand, though acknowledging his industry, would not receive him among\r\nthem. His experiments greatly interested Benjamin Franklin, who used to\r\nvisit him and Goethe always regarded his rejection by the academy as a\r\nglaring instance of scientific despotism. In 1780 he had published at\r\nNeuchâtel a _Plan de législation criminelle_, founded on the principles\r\nof Beccaria. In April 1786 he resigned his court appointment. The\r\nresults of his leisure were in 1787 a new translation of Newton's\r\n_Optics_, and in 1788 his _Mémoires académiques, ou nouvelles\r\ndécouvertes sur la lumière_.\r\n\r\nHis scientific life was now over, his political life was to begin; in\r\nthe notoriety of that political life his great scientific and\r\nphilosophical knowledge was to be forgotten, the high position he had\r\ngiven up denied, and he himself scoffed at as an ignorant charlatan, who\r\nhad sold quack medicines about the streets of Paris, and been glad to\r\nearn a few sous in the stables of the comte d'Artois. In 1788 the\r\nnotables had met, and advised the assembling of the states-general. The\r\nelections were the cause of a flood of pamphlets, of which one,\r\n_Offrande à la patrie_, was by Marat, and, though now forgotten, dwelt\r\non much the same points as the famous brochure of the Abbé Siéyès:\r\n_Qu'est-ce que le tiers état?_ When the states-general met, Marat's\r\ninterest was as great as ever, and in June 1789 he published a\r\nsupplement to his _Offrande_, followed in July by _La constitution_, in\r\nwhich he embodies his idea of a constitution for France, and in\r\nSeptember by his _Tableau des vices de la constitution d'Angleterre_,\r\nwhich he presented to the Assembly. The latter alone deserves remark.\r\nThe Assembly was at this time full of anglomaniacs, who desired to\r\nestablish in France a constitution similar to that of England. Marat had\r\nseen that England was at this time being ruled by an oligarchy using the\r\nforms of liberty, which, while pretending to represent the country, was\r\nreally being gradually mastered by the royal power. His heart was now\r\nall in politics; and he decided to start a paper. At first appeared a\r\nsingle number of the _Moniteur patriote_, followed on the 12th of\r\nSeptember by the first number of the _Publiciste parisien_, which on the\r\n16th of September took the title of _L'Ami du peuple_ and which he\r\nedited, with some interruptions, until the 21st of September 1792.\r\n\r\nThe life of Marat now becomes part of the history of the French\r\nRevolution. From the beginning to the end he stood alone. He was never\r\nattached to any party; the tone of his mind was to suspect whoever was\r\nin power. About his paper, the incarnation of himself, the first thing\r\nto be said is that the man always meant what he said; no poverty, no\r\nmisery or persecution, could keep him quiet; he was perpetually crying,\r\n\"Nous sommes trahis.\" Whoever suspected any one had only to denounce him\r\nto the _Ami du peuple_, and the denounced was never let alone till he\r\nwas proved innocent or guilty. Marat began by attacking the most\r\npowerful bodies in Paris--the Constituent Assembly, the ministers, the\r\ncorps municipal, and the court of the Châtelet. Denounced and arrested,\r\nhe was imprisoned from the 8th of October to the 5th of November 1789. A\r\nsecond time, owing to his violent campaign against Lafayette, he\r\nnarrowly escaped arrest and had to flee to London (Jan. 1790). There he\r\nwrote his _Dénonciation contre Necker_, and in May dared to return to\r\nParis and continue the _Ami du peuple_. He was embittered by\r\npersecution, and continued his vehement attacks against all in power,\r\nand at last, after the day of the Champs du Mars (July 17, 1790),\r\nagainst the king himself. All this time he was in hiding in cellars and\r\nsewers, where he was attacked by a horrible skin disease, tended only by\r\nthe woman Simonne Evrard, who remained true to him. The end of the\r\nConstituent Assembly he heard of with joy and with bright hopes for the\r\nfuture, soon dashed by the behaviour of the Legislative Assembly. When\r\nalmost despairing, in December 1791, he fled once more to London, where\r\nhe wrote his _Ecole du citoyen_. In April 1792, summoned again by the\r\nCordeliers' Club, he returned to Paris, and published No. 627 of the\r\n_Ami_. The war was now the question, and Marat saw clearly that it was\r\nto serve the purposes of the Royalists and the Girondins, who thought of\r\nthemselves alone. Again denounced, Marat had to remain in hiding until\r\nthe 10th of August. The early days of the war being unsuccessful, the\r\nproclamation of the duke of Brunswick excited all hearts; who could go\r\nto save France on the frontiers and leave Paris in the hands of his\r\nenemies? Marat, like Danton, foresaw the massacres of September. After\r\nthe events of the 10th of August he took his seat at the commune, and\r\ndemanded a tribunal to try the Royalists in prison. No tribunal was\r\nformed, and the massacres in the prisons were the inevitable result. In\r\nthe elections to the Convention, Marat was elected seventh out of the\r\ntwenty-four deputies for Paris, and for the first time took his seat in\r\nan assembly of the nation. At the declaration of the republic, he closed\r\nhis _Ami du peuple_, and commenced, on the 25th, a new paper, the\r\n_Journal de la république française_, which was to contain his\r\nsentiments as its predecessor had done, and to be always on the watch.\r\nIn the Assembly Marat had no party; he would always suspect and oppose\r\nthe powerful, refuse power for himself. After the battle of Valmy,\r\nDumouriez was the greatest man in France; he could almost have restored\r\nthe monarchy; yet Marat did not fear to denounce him in placards as a\r\ntraitor.\r\n\r\nHis unpopularity in the Assembly was extreme, yet he insisted on\r\nspeaking on the question of the king's trial, declared it unfair to\r\naccuse Louis for anything anterior to his acceptance of _the_\r\nconstitution, and though implacable towards the king, as the one man who\r\nmust die for the people's good, he would not allow Malesherbes, the\r\nking's counsel, to be attacked in his paper, and speaks of him as a\r\n\"sage et respectable vieillard.\" The king dead, the months from January\r\nto May 1793 were spent in an unrelenting struggle between Marat and the\r\nGirondins. Marat despised the ruling party because they had suffered\r\nnothing for the republic, because they talked too much of their feelings\r\nand their antique virtue, because they had for their own virtues plunged\r\nthe country into war; while the Girondins hated Marat as representative\r\nof that rough red republicanism which would not yield itself to a Roman\r\nrepublic, with themselves for tribunes, orators and generals. The\r\nGirondins conquered at first in the Convention, and ordered that Marat\r\nshould be tried before the Revolutionary Tribunal. But their victory\r\nruined them, for on the 24th of April Marat was acquitted, and returned\r\nto the Convention with the people at his back. The fall of the Girondins\r\non the 31st of May was a triumph for Marat. But it was his last. The\r\nskin disease he had contracted in the subterranean haunts was rapidly\r\nclosing his life; he could only ease his pain by sitting in a warm bath,\r\nwhere he wrote his journal, and accused the Girondins, who were trying\r\nto raise France against Paris. Sitting thus on the 13th of July he heard\r\nin the evening a young woman begging to be admitted to see him, saying\r\nthat she brought news from Caen, where the escaped Girondins were trying\r\nto rouse Normandy. He ordered her to be admitted, asked her the names of\r\nthe deputies then at Caen, and, after writing their names, said, \"They\r\nshall be soon guillotined,\" when the young girl, whose name was\r\nCharlotte Corday (q.v.), stabbed him to the heart.\r\n\r\nHis death caused a great commotion at Paris. The Convention attended his\r\nfuneral, and placed his bust in the hall where it held its sessions.\r\nLouis David painted \"Marat Assassinated,\" and a veritable cult was\r\nrendered to the Friend of the People, whose ashes were transferred to\r\nthe Panthéon with great pomp on the 21st of September 1794--to be cast\r\nout again in virtue of the decree of the 8th of February 1795.\r\n\r\nMarat's name was long an object of execration on account of his\r\ninsistence on the death penalty. He stands in history as a bloodthirsty\r\nmonster, yet in judging him one must remember the persecutions he\r\nendured and the terrible disease from which he suffered.\r\n\r\n  Besides the works mentioned above, Marat wrote: _Recherches physiques\r\n  sur l'électricité, &c._ (1782); _Recherches sur l'électricité\r\n  médicale_ (1783); _Notions élémentaires d'optique_ (1764); _Lettres de\r\n  l'observateur Bon Sens à M. de M. ... sur la fatale catastrophe des\r\n  infortunés Pilatre de Rozier et Romain, les aéronautes et\r\n  l'aérostation_ (1785); _Observations de M. l'amateur Avec à M. l'abbé\r\n  Sans ... &c._, (1785); _Éloge de Montesquieu_ (1785), published 1883\r\n  by M. de Bresetz; _Les Charlatans modernes, ou lettres sur le\r\n  charlatanisme académique_ (1791); _Les Aventures du comte Potowski_\r\n  (published in 1847 by Paul Lacroix, the \"bibliophile Jacob\"); _Lettres\r\n  polonaises_ (unpublished). Marat's works were published by A.\r\n  Vermorel, _Oeuvres de J. P. Marat, l'ami du peuple, recueillies et\r\n  annotées_ (1869). Two of his tracts, (1) _On Gleets_, (2) _A Disease\r\n  of the Eyes_, were reprinted, ed. J. B. Bailey, in 1891.\r\n\r\n  See A.

A.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARATHI (properly _Marathi_),[1] the name of an important Indo-Aryan\r\nlanguage spoken in western and central India. In 1901 the number of\r\nspeakers was 18,237,899, or about the same as the population of Spain.\r\nMarathi occupies an irregular triangular area of approximately 100,000\r\nsq.m., having its apex about the district of Balaghat in the Central\r\nProvinces, and for its base the western coast of the peninsula from\r\nDaman on the Gulf of Cambay in the north to Karwar on the open Arabian\r\nSea in the south. It covers parts of two provinces of British\r\nIndia--Bombay and the Central Provinces (including Berar)--with numerous\r\nsettlers in Central India and Madras, and is also the principal language\r\nof Portuguese India and of the north-western portion of His Highness the\r\nNizam's dominions. The standard form of speech is that of Poona in\r\nBombay, and, in its various dialects it covers the larger part of that\r\nprovince, in which it is the vernacular of more than eight and a half\r\nmillions of people.\r\n\r\nAs explained in the article INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES, there were in ancient\r\ntimes two main groups of these forms of speech--one, the language of the\r\nMidland, spoken in the country near the Gangetic Doab, and the other,\r\nthe languages of the so-called \"Outer Band,\" containing the Midland on\r\nthree sides, west, east and south. The country to the south of the\r\nMidland, in which members of this Outer group of languages were formerly\r\nspoken, included the modern Rajputana and Gujarat, and extended to the\r\nbasin of the river Nerbudda, being bounded on the south by the Vindhya\r\nhills. In the course of time the population of the Midland expanded, and\r\ngradually occupied this tract, reaching the sea in Gujarat. The language\r\nof the Outer Band was thus forced farther afield. Its speakers crossed\r\nthe Vindhyas and settled in the central plateau of the Deccan and on the\r\nKonkan coast. Here they came into contact with speakers of the Dravidian\r\nlanguages of southern India. As happened elsewhere in India, they\r\nretained their own Aryan tongue, and gradually through the influence of\r\ntheir superior civilization imposed it upon the aborigines, so that all\r\nthe inhabitants of this tract became the ancestors of the speakers of\r\nmodern Marathi.\r\n\r\nIn Rajputana and Gujarat the language (see GUJARAT) is to a certain\r\nextent mixed. Near the original Midland there are few traces of the\r\nOuter language, but as we go farther and farther away from that centre\r\nwe find, as might be expected, the influence of the Midland language\r\nbecoming weaker and weaker, and traces of the Outer language becoming\r\nmore and more evident, until in Gujarati we recognize several important\r\nsurvivals of the old language once spoken by the earlier Aryan\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n_Dialects._--Besides the standard form of speech, there is only one real\r\ndialect of Marathi, viz. Konkani (Konkani), spoken in the country near\r\nGoa. There are also several local varieties, and we may conveniently\r\ndistinguish between the Marathi of the Deccan, that of the Central\r\nProvinces (including Berar), and that of the northern and central\r\nKonkan. In the southern part of the district of Ratnagiri this latter\r\nKonkani variety of Marathi gradually merges into the true Konkani\r\ndialect through a number of intermediate forms of speech. There are also\r\nseveral broken jargones, based upon Marathi, employed by aboriginal\r\ntribes surviving in the hill country.\r\n\r\n_Relations with other Indo-Aryan Languages._--Marathi has to its north,\r\nin order from west to east, Gujarati, Rajasthani, Western Hindi and\r\nEastern Hindi. To its east and south it has the Dravidian languages,\r\nGondi, Telugu and Kanarese. Elsewhere in India Aryan languages gradually\r\nfade away into each other, so that it is impossible to fix any definite\r\nboundary line between them. But this is not the case with Marathi. It\r\ndoes not merge into any of the cognate neighbouring forms of speech, but\r\npossesses a distinct linguistic frontier. A native writer[2] says: \"The\r\nGujarati language agrees very closely with the languages of the\r\ncountries lying to the north of it, because the Gujarati people came\r\nfrom the north. If a native of Delhi, Ajmere, Marwar, Mewar, Jaipur,\r\n&c., comes into Gujarat, the Gujarati people find no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding his language. But it is very wonderful that when people\r\nfrom countries bordering Gujarat on the south, as the Konkan,\r\nMaharashtra, &c. (i.e. people speaking Marathi) come to Gujarat, the\r\nGujarati people do not in the least comprehend what they say.\" This\r\nisolated character of Marathi is partly due to the barrier of the\r\nVindhya range which lies to its north, and partly to the fact that none\r\nof the northern languages belongs now to the Outer Band, but are in more\r\nor less close relationship to the language of the Midland. There was no\r\ncommon ground either physical or linguistic, upon which the colliding\r\nforms of speech could meet on equal terms. Eastern Hindi is more closely\r\nrelated to Marathi than the others, and in its case, in its bordering\r\ndialects, we do find a few traces of the influence of Marathi--traces\r\nwhich are part of the essence of the language, and not mere borrowed\r\nwaifs floating on the top of a sea of alien speech and not absorbed by\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Written Character._--Marathi books are generally printed in the\r\nwell-known Nagari character (see SANSKRIT), and this is also used to a\r\ngreat extent in private transactions and correspondence. In the Maratha\r\ncountry it is known as the _Balbodh_ (\"teachable to children,\" i.e.\r\n\"easy\") character. A cursive form of Nagari called _Modi_, or \"twisted,\"\r\nis also employed as a handwriting. It is said to have been invented in\r\nthe 17th century by Balaji Avaji, the secretary of the celebrated\r\nSivaji. Its chief merit is that each word can be written as a whole\r\nwithout lifting the pen from the paper, a feat which is impossible in\r\nthe case of Nagari.[3]\r\n\r\n_Origin of the Language._--The word \"Marathi\" signifies (the language)\r\nof the Maratha country. It is the modern form of the Sanskrit\r\n_Maharastri_, just as \"Maratha\" represents the old _Maha-rastra_, or\r\nGreat Kingdom. _Maharastri_ was the name given by Sanskrit writers to\r\nthe particular form of Prakrit spoken in Maharastra, the great Aryan\r\nkingdom extending southwards from the Vindhya range to the Kistna,\r\nbroadly corresponding to the southern part of the Bombay Presidency and\r\nto the state of Hyderabad. As pointed out in the article PRAKRIT this\r\nMaharastri early obtained literary pre-eminence in India, and became the\r\nform of Prakrit employed as the language not only of lyric poetry but\r\nalso of the formal epic (_kavya_). Dramatic works were composed in it,\r\nand it was the vehicle of the non-canonical scriptures of the Jaina\r\nreligion. The oldest work in the language of which we have any knowledge\r\nis the _Sattasai_, or Seven Centuries of verses, compiled at\r\nPratisthana, on the Godavari, the capital of King Hala, at some time\r\nbetween the 3rd and 7th centuries A.D. Pratisthana is the modern Paithan\r\nin the Aurangabad district of Hyderabad, and that city was for long\r\nfamous as a centre of literary composition. In later times the political\r\ncentre of gravity was changed to Poona, the language of which district\r\nis now accepted as the standard of the best Marathi.\r\n\r\n_General Character of the Language._--In the following account of the\r\nmain features of Marathi, the reader is presumed to be familiar with the\r\nleading facts stated in the articles INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES and PRAKRIT.\r\nIn the Prakrit stage of the Indo-Aryan languages we can divide the\r\nPrakrits into two well-defined groups, an Inner, Sauraseni and its\r\nconnected dialects on the one hand, and an Outer, Maharastri,\r\nArdhamagadhi, and Magadhi with their connected dialects on the other.\r\nThese two groups differed in their phonetic laws, in their systems of\r\ndeclension and conjugation, in vocabulary, and in general character.[4]\r\nIn regard to the last point reference may be made to the frequent use of\r\nmeaningless suffixes, such as -_alla_, -_illa_, -_ulla_, &c., which can\r\nbe added, almost _ad libitum_ to any noun, adjective or particle in\r\nMaharastri and Ardhamagadhi, but which are hardly ever met in Sauraseni.\r\nThese give rise to numerous secondary forms of words, used, it might be\r\nsaid, in a spirit of playfulness, which give a distinct flavour to the\r\nwhole language. Similarly the late Mr Beames (_Comparative Grammar_, i.\r\n103) well describes Marathi as possessing \"a very decided individuality,\r\na type quite its own, arising from its comparative isolation for so\r\nmany centuries.\" Elsewhere (p. 38) he uses language which would easily\r\nwell apply to Maharastri Prakrit when he says, \"Marathi is one of those\r\nlanguages which we may call playful--it delights in all sorts of\r\njingling formations, and has struck out a larger quantity of secondary\r\nand tertiary words, diminutives, and the like, than any of the cognate\r\ntongues,\" and again (p. 52):--\r\n\r\n  \"In Marathi we see the results of the Pandit's file applied to a form\r\n  of speech originally possessed of much natural wildness and licence.\r\n  The hedgerows have been pruned and the wild briars and roses trained\r\n  into order. It is a copious and beautiful language, second only to\r\n  Hindi. It has three genders, and the same elaborate preparation of the\r\n  base as Sindhi, and, owing to the great corruption which has taken\r\n  place in its terminations, the difficulty of determining the gender of\r\n  nouns is as great in Marathi as in German. In fact, if we were to\r\n  institute a parallel in this respect, we might appropriately describe\r\n  Hindi as the English, Marathi as the German of the Indian group--Hindi\r\n  having cast aside whatever could possibly be dispensed with, Marathi\r\n  having retained whatever has been spared by the action of time. To an\r\n  Englishman Hindi commends itself by its absence of form, and the\r\n  positional structure of its sentences resulting therefrom; to our\r\n  High-German cousins the Marathi, with its fuller array of genders,\r\n  terminations, and inflexions, would probably seem the completer and\r\n  finer language.\"\r\n\r\nIn the article PRAKRIT it is explained that the literary Prakrits were\r\nnot the direct parents of the modern Indo-Aryan vernaculars. Each\r\nPrakrit had first to pass through an intermediate stage--that of the\r\nApabhramsa--before it took the form current at the present day. While we\r\nknow a good deal about Maharastri and very little about Sauraseni\r\nPrakrit, the case is reversed in regard to their respective Apabhramsas.\r\nThe Saurasena Apabhramsa is the only one concerning which we have\r\ndefinite information. Although it would be quite possible to reason from\r\nanalogy, and thus to obtain what would be the corresponding forms of\r\nMaharastra Apabhramsa, we should often be travelling upon insecure\r\nground, and it is therefore advisable to compare Marathi, not with the\r\nApabhramsa from which it is immediately derived, but with its\r\ngrandmother, Maharastri Prakrit. We shall adopt this course, so far as\r\npossible, in the following pages.\r\n\r\n  _Vocabulary._--In the article INDO-ARYAN LANGUAGES it is explained\r\n  that, allowing for phonetic development, the vocabulary of Sauraseni\r\n  Prakrit was the same as that of Sanskrit, but that the farther we go\r\n  from the Midland, the more examples we meet of a new class of words,\r\n  the so-called _desyas_, descendants of the old Primary Prakrits spoken\r\n  outside the Midland, and strange to Sanskrit. Maharastri Prakrit, the\r\n  most independent of the Outer languages, was distinguished by the\r\n  large proportion of these _desyas_ found in its vocabulary, and the\r\n  same is consequently the case in Marathi. The Brahmins of the Maratha\r\n  country have always had a great reputation for learning, and their\r\n  efforts to create a literary language out of their vernacular took, as\r\n  in other parts of India, the direction of borrowing _tatsamas_ from\r\n  Sanskrit, to lend what they considered to be dignity to their\r\n  sentences. But the richness of the language in _desya_ words has often\r\n  rendered such borrowing unnecessary, and has saved Marathi, although\r\n  the proportion of _tatsamas_ to _tadbhavas_[5] in the language is more\r\n  than sufficiently high, from the fate of the Pandit-ridden literary\r\n  Bengali, in which 80 to 90% of the vocabulary is pure Sanskrit. There\r\n  is indeed a tradition of stylistic chastity in the Maratha country\r\n  from the earliest times, and even Sanskrit writers contrasted the\r\n  simple elegance of the Deccan (or _Vaidarbhi_) style with the flowery\r\n  complexity of eastern India.\r\n\r\n  The proportion of Persian and, through Persian, of Arabic words in the\r\n  Marathi vocabulary is comparatively low, when compared with, say,\r\n  Hindostani. The reason is, firstly, the predominance in the literary\r\n  world of these learned Brahmins, and, secondly, the fact that the\r\n  Maratha country was not conquered by the Mussulmans till a fairly late\r\n  period, nor was it so thoroughly occupied by them as were Sind, the\r\n  Punjab, and the Gangetic valley.\r\n\r\n  _Phonetics._[6]--In the standard dialect the vowels are the same as in\r\n  Sanskrit, but _r_ and _l_ only appear in words borrowed directly from\r\n  that language (_tatsamas_). Final short vowels (_a_, _i_ and _u_) have\r\n  all disappeared in prose pronunciation, except in a few local\r\n  dialects, and final _i_ and _u_ are not even written. On the other\r\n  hand, in the Nagari character, the non-pronunciation of a final _a_ is\r\n  not indicated. After an accented syllable a medial _a_ is pronounced\r\n  very lightly, even when the accent is not the main accent of the word.\r\n  Thus, if we indicate the main accent by ', and subsidiary accents\r\n  (equivalent to the Hebrew _methegh_) by `, then the word _kárawat_, a\r\n  saw, is pronounced _kár^awat_; and _kàlakálane_, to be agitated, is\r\n  pronounced _kàl^akál^an_e. In Konkani the vowel _a_ assumes the sound\r\n  of o in \"hot,\" a sound which is also heard in the language of Bengal.\r\n  In dialectic speech _e_ is often interchangeable with short or long\r\n  _a_, so that the standard _sangit^al_e, it was said, may appear as\r\n  _sangit^ala_ or _sangit^ala_. The vowels _e_ and _o_ are apparently\r\n  always long in the standard dialect, thus following Sanskrit; but in\r\n  Konkani there is a short and a long form of each vowel. Very probably,\r\n  although the distinction is not observed in writing, and has not been\r\n  noticed by native scholars, these vowels are also pronounced short in\r\n  the standard dialect under the circumstances to be now described. When\r\n  a long _a_, _i_ or _u_ precedes an accented syllable it is usually\r\n  shortened. In the case of _a_ the shortening is not indicated by the\r\n  spelling, but the written long _a_ is pronounced short like the _a_ in\r\n  the Italian _ballo_. Thus, the dative of _pik_, a ripe crop, is\r\n  _pikas_, and that of _hat_, a hand, is _hatas_, pronounced _hatas_.\r\n  Almost the only compound consonants which survived in the Prakrit\r\n  stage were double letters, and in M. these are usually simplified, the\r\n  preceding vowel being lengthened in compensation. Thus, the Prakrit\r\n  _kanno_ becomes _kan_, an ear; Pr. _bhikkha_ becomes _bhik_, alms; and\r\n  Pr. _putto_ becomes _put_, a son. In the Pisaca (see INDO-ARYAN\r\n  LANGUAGES) and other languages of north-western India it is not usual\r\n  to lengthen the vowel in compensation, and the same tendency is\r\n  observable in Konkani, which, it may be remarked, appears to contain\r\n  many relics of the old Prakrit (Saurastri) spoken in the Gujarat\r\n  country before the invasion from the Midland. Thus, in Konkani, we\r\n  have _put_ as well as _put_, while the word corresponding to the Pr.\r\n  _ekko_, one, is _ek_ as well as the standard _ek_.\r\n\r\n  On the whole, the consonantal system is much the same as in other\r\n  Indian languages. Nasalization of long vowels is very common,\r\n  especially in Konkani. In this article it is indicated by the sign ~\r\n  placed over the affected vowel. The palatals are pronounced as in Skr.\r\n  in words borrowed from that language or from Hindostani, and also in\r\n  Marathi _tadbhavas_ before _i_, _i_, _e_ or _y_. Thus, _cand_\r\n  (_tatsama_), fierce; _jama_ (Hindostani), collected; _cikhal_ (M.\r\n  _tadbhava_), mud. In other cases they are pronounced _ts_, _tsh_,\r\n  _dz_, _dzh_ respectively. Thus _tsakar_ (for _cakar_), a servant;\r\n  _dzane_ (for _jane_), to go. There are two _s_-sounds in the standard\r\n  dialect which are very similarly distinguished. _S_, pronounced like\r\n  an English _sh_, is used before _i_, _i_, _e_ or _y_; and _s_, as in\r\n  English \"sin,\" elsewhere. Thus, _simphi_, a caste-name; _sil_, a\r\n  stone; _set_, a field; _syam_, dark blue; but _sap_, a snake; _sumar_\r\n  (Persian _shumar_), an estimate; _stri_, a woman. In the dialects _s_\r\n  is practically the only sibilant used, and that is changed by the\r\n  vulgar speakers of Konkani to _h_ (again as in north-western India).\r\n  Aspirated letters show a tendency to lose their aspiration, especially\r\n  in Konkani. Thus, _bhik_ (for _bhikh_), alms, quoted above; _hat_ (Pr.\r\n  _hattho_), a hand. In Konkani we have words such as _boin_, a sister,\r\n  against standard _bhain_; _ger_, standard _ghari_, in a house; _ami_,\r\n  standard _amhi_, we. Here again we have agreement with north-western\r\n  India. Generally speaking Marathi closely follows Maharastra when that\r\n  differs from the Prakrits of other parts of India. Thus we have Skr.\r\n  _vrajati_, Maharastri _vaccai_ (instead of _vajjai_), he goes; Konkani\r\n  _votsu_, to go; Sauraseni _genhiduim_, Maharastri _ghettum_, to take;\r\n  Marathi _ghet^ale_, taken. There is similarly both in Marathi and\r\n  Maharastri a laxness in distinguishing between cerebral and dental\r\n  letters (which again reminds us of north-western India). Thus, Skr.\r\n  _dasati_, Maharastri _dasai_, he bites; M. _das^ane_ to bite; Skr.\r\n  _dahati_, Maharastri _dahai_, he burns; M. _dadz^ane_, to be hot; Skr.\r\n  _gardabhas_; Sauraseni _gaddaho_; Hindostani _gadha_; but Maharastri\r\n  _gaddaho_; M. _gadhav_, an ass; and so many others. In Maharastri\r\n  every _n_ becomes _n_, but in Jaina MSS. when the _n_ was initial or\r\n  doubled it remained unchanged. A similar rule is followed regarding\r\n  _l_ and the cerebral _l_ common in Vedic Sanskrit, in MSS. coming from\r\n  southern India, and, according to the grammarians, also in the Pisaca\r\n  dialects of the north-west. In M. a Pr. double _nn_ or _ll_ is\r\n  simplified, according to the usual rule, to _n_ or _l_ respectively,\r\n  with lengthening of the preceding vowel in compensation. Both _n_ and\r\n  _l_ are of frequent occurrence in M., but only as medial letters, and\r\n  then only when they represent _n_ or _l_ in the Pr. stage. When the\r\n  letter is initial or represents a double _nn_ or _ll_ of Pr. it is\r\n  always _n_ or _l_ respectively, thus offering a striking testimony to\r\n  the accuracy of the Jaina and southern MSS. Thus, ordinary Maharastri\r\n  _na_, but Jaina Maharastri _na_, M. na, not; Maharastri (both kinds)\r\n  _ghano_, M. _ghan_, dense; Maharastri _sonnaam_, Jaina _sonnaam_, M.\r\n  _sone_, gold; Maharastri _kalo_, time, southern MSS. of the same\r\n  _kalo_, M. _kal_, time; Maharastri _callai_, M. _tsale_, he goes or\r\n  used to go. In some of the local dialects, following the Vedic\r\n  practice, we find _l_ where _d_ is employed elsewhere, as in (Berar)\r\n  _ghola_ for _ghoda_, a horse; and there are instances of this change\r\n  occurring even in Maharastri; e.g. Skr. _tadagam_, Maharastri\r\n  _talaam_, M. _tale_, a pond.\r\n\r\n  The Skr. compound consonant _jñ_ is pronounced _dny_ in the standard\r\n  dialect, but _gy_ in the Konkan. Thus, Skr. _jñanam_ becomes _dnyan_\r\n  or _gyan_ according to locality.\r\n\r\n  _Declension._--Marathi and Gujarati are the only Indo-Aryan languages\r\n  which have retained the three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter,\r\n  of Sanskrit and Prakrit. In rural dialects of Western Hindi and of\r\n  Rajasthani sporadic instances of the neuter gender have survived, but\r\n  elsewhere the only example occurs in the interrogative pronoun. In\r\n  Marathi the neuter denotes not only inanimate things but also animate\r\n  beings when both sexes are included, or when the sex is left\r\n  undecided. Thus, _ghode_, neut., a horse, without regard to sex. In\r\n  the Konkan the neuter gender is further employed to denote females\r\n  below the age of puberty, as in _cedu_, a girl. Numerous masculine and\r\n  feminine words, however, denote inanimate objects. The rules for\r\n  distinguishing the gender of such nouns are as complicated as in\r\n  German, and must be learned from the grammars. For the most part, but\r\n  not always, words follow the genders of their Skr. originals, and the\r\n  abrasion of terminations in the modern language renders it impossible\r\n  to lay down any complete set of rules on the subject. We may, however,\r\n  say that strong bases (see below) in _a_--and these do not include\r\n  _tatsamas_--are masculine, and that the corresponding feminine and\r\n  neuter words end in _i_ and _e_ respectively. Thus, _mul^aga_, a son;\r\n  _mul^agi_, a daughter; _mul^age_, a child of so and so. As a further\r\n  guide we may say that sex is usually distinguished by the use of the\r\n  masculine and feminine genders, and that large and powerful inanimate\r\n  objects are generally masculine, while small, delicate things are\r\n  generally feminine. In the case of some animals (as in our \"horse\" and\r\n  \"mare\") sex is distinguished by the use of different words; e.g.\r\n  _bokad_, he-goat, and _seli_, a nanny-goat.\r\n\r\n  The nominative form of a _tadbhava_ word is derived from the\r\n  nominative form in Sanskrit and Prakrit, but _tatsama_ words are\r\n  generally borrowed in the form of the Sanskrit crude base. Thus, Skr.\r\n  crude base _malin_, nom. sing, _mali_; Pr. nom. _malio_ (_malio_); M.\r\n  _mali_ (_tadbhava_), a gardener; Skr. base _mati_-; nom. _matis_; M.\r\n  _mati_ (_tatsama_). Some _tatsamas_ are, however, borrowed in the\r\n  nominative form, as in Skr. _dhanin_, nom. _dhani_; M. _dhani_, a rich\r\n  man. In Prakrit the nominative singular of many masculine _tatsamas_\r\n  ended in _o_. In the Apabhramsa stage this _o_ was weakened to _u_,\r\n  and in modern Marathi, under the general rule, this final short _u_\r\n  was dropped, the noun thus reverting as stated above to the form of\r\n  the Sanskrit crude base. But in old Marathi, the short u was still\r\n  retained. Thus, the Sanskrit _isvaras_, lord, became, as a Prakrit\r\n  _tatsama_, _isvaro_, which in Apabhramsa took the form _isvaru_. The\r\n  old Marathi form was also _isvaru_, but in modern Marathi we have\r\n  _isvar_. _Tadbhavas_ derived from Sanskrit bases in _a_ are treated\r\n  very similarly, the termination being dropped in the modern language.\r\n  Thus, Skr. nom. masc. _karnas_, Pr. _kanno_, M. _kan_; Skr. nom. sing.\r\n  fem. _khatva_, Pr. _khatta_, M. _khat_, a bed; Skr. nom. sing. neut.\r\n  _grham_, Pr. _gharam_, M. _ghar_, a house. Sometimes the Skr. nom.\r\n  sing. fem. of these nouns ends in _i_, but this makes no difference,\r\n  as in Skr. and Pr. _culli_, M. _cul_, a fireplace. There is one\r\n  important set of exceptions to this rule. In the article PRAKRIT\r\n  attention is drawn to the frequent use of pleonastic suffixes,\r\n  especially of -(a)_ka_- (masc. and neut.), -(i)_ka_(fem.). This could\r\n  in Sanskrit be added to any noun, whatever the termination of the base\r\n  might be. In Prakrit the _k_ of this suffix, being medial, was elided,\r\n  so that we get forms like Skr. nom. sing. masc. _ghota-kas_, Pr.\r\n  ghoda-o, M. ghoda, a horse; Skr. nom. sing. fem. ghoti-ka, Pr.\r\n  _ghodi-a_, M. _ghodi_, a mare; Skr. _ghota-kam_, Pr. _ghoda-(y)am_, M.\r\n  _ghode_, a horse (without distinction of sex). Such modern forms made\r\n  with this pleonastic suffix, and ending in _a_, _i_ or _e_ are called\r\n  \"strong forms,\" while all those made without it are called \"weak\r\n  forms.\" As a rule the fact that a noun is in a weak or a strong form\r\n  does not affect its meaning, but sometimes the use of a masculine\r\n  strong form indicates clumsiness or hugeness. Thus _bhakar_ (weak\r\n  form) means \"bread,\" while _bhak^ara_ (strong form) means \"a huge loaf\r\n  of bread.\" The other pleonastic suffixes mentioned under PRAKRIT are\r\n  also employed in Marathi, but usually with specific senses. Thus the\r\n  suffix -_illa_- generally forms adjectives, while -_da-ka_- (in M.\r\n  -_da_, fem. -_di_, neut. -_de_) implies contempt.\r\n\r\n  The synthetic declension of Sanskrit and Prakrit has been preserved in\r\n  Marathi more completely than in any other Indo-Aryan language. While\r\n  Maharastri Prakrit, like all others, passed through the Apabhramsa\r\n  stage in the course of its development, the conservative character of\r\n  the language retained even in that stage some of the old pure\r\n  Maharastri forms. In the article PRAKRIT we have seen how there\r\n  gradually arose a laxity in distinguishing the cases. In Maharastri\r\n  the Sanskrit dative fell into almost entire disuse, the genitive being\r\n  used in its place, while in Apabhramsa the case terminations become\r\n  worn down to -_hu_, -_ho_, -_hi_, -_hi_ and -_ha_, of which -_hi_ and\r\n  -_hi_ were employed for several cases, both singular and plural. There\r\n  was also a marked tendency for these terminations to become confused,\r\n  so that in the earliest stages of most of the modern Indo-Aryan\r\n  vernaculars we find -_hi_ freely employed for any oblique case of the\r\n  singular, and -_hi_ for any oblique case of the plural. Another\r\n  feature of Prakrit was the simplification of the complicated\r\n  declensional system of Sanskrit by assimilating it in all cases to the\r\n  declension of _a_-bases, corresponding to the first and second\r\n  declensions in Latin.\r\n\r\n  In the formation of the plural the Prakrit declensions are very\r\n  closely followed by Marathi. We shall confine our remarks to\r\n  _a_-bases, which may be either weak or strong forms, and of which the\r\n  feminine ends sometimes in _a_, and sometimes in _i_. In Prakrit the\r\n  nom. plur. of these nouns ends masc. _a_, fem. _ao_, _io_, neut.\r\n  _aim_. We thus get the following:--\r\n\r\n    +--------------+-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n    |              |        Masculine.       |                       Feminine.                      |          Neuter.        |\r\n    |              +------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n    |              | Nom.

We\r\n  may note the following, some of which have preserved the Maharastri\r\n  forms, while others are directly derived from the Apabhramsa stage of\r\n  the language. We content ourselves with giving some of the synthetic\r\n  cases of one noun, a weak neuter a-base, ghar, a house.\r\n\r\n    +------------------+--------------------+-------------------+----------------+\r\n    |                  | Maharastri Prakrit.|    Apabhramsa.    |    Marathi.    |\r\n    |                  +--------------------+-------------------+----------------+\r\n    |Sing.             |                    |                   |                |\r\n    |  Nominative      | gharam             | gharu             | ghar           |\r\n    |  Dative          | gharassa (genitive)| gharaho (genitive)| gharas (dative)|\r\n    |  Locative        | ghare              | gharahi (-hi)     | ghari, ghara   |\r\n    |  General oblique | gharassa (genitive)| gharaho (genitive)| gharas, ghara  |\r\n    |Plur.             |                    |                   |                |\r\n    |  Nominative      | gharaim            | gharai            | ghare          |\r\n    |  Locative        | gharesu            | gharahi (-hi)     | ghari          |\r\n    |  General oblique | gharana (genitive) | gharaha (genitive)| ghara          |\r\n    +------------------+--------------------+-------------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n  As already stated, in Prakrit the genitive is employed instead of the\r\n  dative, and thus forms the basis of the Marathi dative singular. The\r\n  genitive plural is not used as a dative plural in Marathi, but it is\r\n  the basis of the plural general oblique case. The Marathi singular\r\n  general oblique case is really the same as the Marathi dative\r\n  singular, but in the standard form of speech when so used the final\r\n  _s_ is dropped, _gharas_, as a general oblique case, being only found\r\n  in dialects. This general oblique case is the result of the confusion\r\n  of the various oblique cases originally distinguished in Sanskrit and\r\n  in literary Prakrit. In Apabhramsa the genitive began to usurp the\r\n  function of all the other cases. It is obvious that if it were\r\n  regularly employed in so indeterminate a sense, it would give rise to\r\n  great confusion. Hence when it was intended to show clearly what\r\n  particular case was meant, it became usual to add, to this\r\n  indeterminate genitive, defining particles corresponding to the\r\n  English \"of,\" \"to,\" \"from,\" \"by,\" &c., which, as in all Indo-Aryan\r\n  languages they follow the main word, are called \"postpositions.\"\r\n  Before dealing with these, it will be convenient to give the modern\r\n  Marathi synthetic declension of the commoner forms of nouns. The only\r\n  synthetic case which is now employed in prose is the dative, and this\r\n  can always be formed from the general oblique case by adding an s to\r\n  the end of the word. It is therefore not given in the following table.\r\n\r\n    +-----------+---------------------------+----------------------------+-------------------------+\r\n    |           |         Masculine.        |          Feminine.         |         Neuter.         |\r\n    +-----------+------+--------+-----------+-------+-----------+--------+-------+--------+--------+\r\n    |  Meaning. | Ear. | Horse. | Gardener. |  Bed. | Fireplace.|  Mare. | House.| Horse. | Pearl. |\r\n    +-----------+------+--------+-----------+-------+-----------+--------+-------+--------+--------+\r\n    |Sing.      |      |        |           |       |           |        |       |        |        |\r\n    |  Nom.     | kan  | ghoda  | mali      | khat  | cul       | ghodi  | ghar  | ghode  | moti   |\r\n    |  Gen. obl.| kana | ghodya | malya     | khate | culi      | ghodi  | ghara | ghodya | motya  |\r\n    |Plur.      |      |        |           |       |           |        |       |        |        |\r\n    |  Nom.     | kan  | ghode  | mali      | khata | culi      | ghodya | ghare | ghodi  | motye  |\r\n    |  Gen. obl.| kana | ghodya | malya     | khata | culi      | ghodya | ghara | ghodya | motya  |\r\n    +-----------+------+--------+-----------+-------+-----------+--------+-------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\n  The usual postpositions are:--\r\n\r\n  Instrumental: _ne_, plural _ni_, by. Dative: _la_, plural also _na_,\r\n  to or for. Ablative: _hun_, _un_, from. Genitive: _tsa_, of. Locative:\r\n  _~t_, in. We thus get the following complete modern declension of\r\n  _ghar_, a house (neut.):--\r\n\r\n            Sing.             Plur.\r\n\r\n    Nom.    ghar              ghare\r\n    Acc.    ghar              ghare\r\n    Instr.  gharane           gharani\r\n    Dat.    gharas, gharala   gharas, gharala, gharana\r\n    Abl.    gharahun, gharun  gharahun\r\n    Gen.    gharatsa          gharatsa\r\n    Loc.    gharat            gharat\r\n\r\n  The accusative is usually the same as the nominative, but when\r\n  definiteness is required the dative is employed instead. The\r\n  termination _ne_, with its plural _ni_, is, as explained in the\r\n  article GUJARATI, really the oblique form, by origin a locative, of\r\n  the _na_ or _no_, employed in Gujarati to form the genitive. The\r\n  suffix _na_ of the dative plural is derived from the same word. Here\r\n  it is probably a corruption of the Apabhramsa _nau_ or _naho_. The\r\n  postposition la is probably a corruption of the Sanskrit _labhe_,\r\n  Apabhramsa _lahi_, for the benefit (of). As regards the ablative, we\r\n  have in old Marathi poetry a form corresponding to _gharahu-niya_,\r\n  which explains the derivation. _Gharahu_ is a by-form of the Prakrit\r\n  synthetic ablative _gharau_, to which _niya_, another oblique form of\r\n  _na_, is added to define the meaning. The locative termination _~t_ is\r\n  a contraction of the Pr. _anto_, Skr. antar, within.\r\n\r\n  The genitive _gharatsa_ is really an adjective meaning \"belonging to\r\n  the house,\" and agrees in gender, number and case with the noun which\r\n  is possessed. Thus:\r\n\r\n    _malyatsa ghoda_, the gardener's horse. _malyace ghode_, the\r\n    gardener's horses.\r\n\r\n    _malyaci ghodi_, the gardener's mare. _malyacya ghodya_, the\r\n    gardener's mares.\r\n\r\n    _malyace ghode_, the gardener's horse (neut.). _malyaci ghodi_, the\r\n    gardener's horses (neut.).\r\n\r\n  The suffix _tsa_, _ci_, _ce_, is derived from the Sanskrit suffix\r\n  _tyakas_, Pr. _cao_, which is used in much the same sense. In Sanskrit\r\n  it may be added either to the locative or to the unmodified base of\r\n  the word to which it is attached, thus, _ghotake-tyakas_ or\r\n  _ghotaka-tyakas_. Similarly in Marathi, while it is usually added to\r\n  the general oblique base, it may also be added to the unmodified noun,\r\n  in which case it has a more distinctly adjectival force. The use of\r\n  _tsa_ has been influenced by the fact that the Sanskrit word _krtyas_,\r\n  Pr. _kiccao_, also takes the same form in Marathi. As explained in the\r\n  article HINDOSTANI, synonyms of this word are used in other Indo-Aryan\r\n  languages to form suffixes of the genitive.[7]\r\n\r\n  Strong adjectives, including genitives, can be declined like\r\n  substantives, and agree with the qualified noun in gender, number and\r\n  case. When the substantive is in an oblique case, the adjective is put\r\n  into the general oblique form without any defining postposition, which\r\n  is added to the substantive alone. Weak adjectives are not inflected\r\n  in modern prose, but are inflected in poetry. As in other Indo-Aryan\r\n  languages, comparison is effected by putting the noun with which\r\n  comparison is made in the ablative case.\r\n\r\n  The pronouns closely follow the Prakrit originals. The origin of all\r\n  these is discussed in the article HINDOSTANI, and the account need not\r\n  be repeated here. As usual in these languages, there is no pronoun of\r\n  the third person, its place being supplied by the demonstratives. The\r\n  following are the principal pronominal forms:--\r\n\r\n  _mi_, I, instr. _mi_, _mya_, dat. _mala_, obl. _madz_; _amhi_, we,\r\n  instr. _amhi_, obl. _amha_; _madzha_, my, of me; _amtsa_, our, of us.\r\n\r\n  _tu_, thou, instr. _tu_, _twa_, dat. _tula_, obl. _tudz_; _tumhi_,\r\n  you, instr. _tumhi_, obl. _tumha_; _tudzha_, thy, of thee; _tumtsa_,\r\n  your, of you.\r\n\r\n  _apan_, self, obl. _ap^ana_, gen. _ap^ala_. This is also employed as\r\n  an honorific pronoun of the second person, and, in addition, to mean\r\n  \"we including you.\"\r\n\r\n  _ha_, this, fem., _hi_, neut. _he_; _to_, he, that, fem. _ti_, neut.\r\n  _te_; _dzo_, who, fem., _ji_, neut. _je_.\r\n\r\n  _kon_, who? _kay_, what? obl. _kasa_; _koni_, any one; _kahi_,\r\n  anything.\r\n\r\n  In all these the plural is employed honorifically instead of the\r\n  singular.\r\n\r\n  _Conjugation._--In Prakrit (q.v.) the complicated system of Sanskrit\r\n  conjugation had already disappeared, and all verbs fell into two\r\n  classes, the first, or _a_-, conjugation, and the second, or _e_-,\r\n  conjugation, in which the _e_ represents the _aya_ of the Sanskrit\r\n  tenth conjugation and of causal and denominative verbs. Marathi\r\n  follows Prakrit in this respect and has two conjugations. The first,\r\n  corresponding to the Prakrit _a_-class, as a rule consists of\r\n  intransitive verbs, and the second, corresponding to the _e_- or\r\n  causal class, of transitive verbs, but there are numerous exceptions.\r\n  Verbs whose roots end in vowels or in _h_ belong partly to one and\r\n  partly to the other conjugation. These conjugations differ only in the\r\n  present and past participles and in the tenses formed from them. Here,\r\n  in the first conjugation an _a_, and in the second conjugation an _i_,\r\n  is inserted between the base and the termination.\r\n\r\n  The only original Prakrit tenses which have survived in Marathi are\r\n  the present and the imperative. The present has lost its original\r\n  meaning and is now a habitual past. It is also the base of the Marathi\r\n  future. These three tenses, the habitual past, the imperative and the\r\n  future, are conjugated as follows. They should be compared with the\r\n  corresponding forms in the article PRAKRIT. The verb selected is the\r\n  root _uth_, rise, of the first conjugation.\r\n\r\n    +--------+------------------+-----------------+---------------------+\r\n    |        |  Habitual past   |                 |                     |\r\n    |        |  (old present),  |   Imperative.   |       Future.       |\r\n    | Person.| I used to rise.  |  Let me rise.   |    I shall rise.    |\r\n    |        +--------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+\r\n    |        |  Sing. | Plural. | Sing. | Plural. |   Sing.  |  Plural. |\r\n    +--------+--------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+\r\n    |   1    | uthe   | uthu    | uthu  | uthu    | uthen    | uthu     |\r\n    |   2    | uthes  | utha    | uth   | utha    | uth^asil | uthal    |\r\n    |   3    | uthe   | uthat   | utho  | uthot   | uthel    | uth^atil |\r\n    +--------+--------+---------+-------+---------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n  As in Rajasthani, Bihari and the Indo-Aryan language of Nepal (see\r\n  PAHARI), the future is formed by adding _l_, or in the first person\r\n  singular _n_, to the old present. In the second person singular the\r\n  _l_ has been added to a form derived from the Pr. _utthasi_, which is\r\n  also the origin of the old present _uthes_. Some scholars, however,\r\n  see in _uthasi_ a derivation of the Prakrit future _utthihisi_, thou\r\n  shalt arise, and a confusion of the Prakrit present and future is\r\n  quite possible.\r\n\r\n  The remaining tenses are modern forms derived from the participles.\r\n  The verbal nouns, participles and infinitives are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    +------------------+---------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n    |                  |   Prakrit     |     Marathi      |     Marathi      |\r\n    |                  |   (First      |      First       |     Second       |\r\n    |                  | Conjugation). |   Conjugation.   |   Conjugation.   |\r\n    |                  +---------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n    | Verbal Noun      | utthaniam     | uth^ane, the act | mar^ane, the act |\r\n    |                  |               |   of rising.     |   of killing.    |\r\n    | Infinitive       | utthium       | uthu, to rise.   | maru, to kill.   |\r\n    | Present          | utthanto,     | uthat, uth^ata,  | marit, marita,   |\r\n    |   Participle     |   utthantao   |   rising.        |   killing.       |\r\n    | Past Participle  | utthiallao    | uth^ala, risen.  | marila, killed.  |\r\n    | Future Participle| utthanaado    | uth^anar, about  | mar^anar, about  |\r\n    |   Active         |               |   to rise.       |   to kill.       |\r\n    | Future Participle| utthiavvao    | uthawa, about    | marawa, about    |\r\n    |   Passive        |               |   to be risen.   |   to be killed.  |\r\n    | Conjunctive      | utthiu        | uthun, having    | marun, having    |\r\n    |   Participle     |               |   risen.         |   killed.        |\r\n    +------------------+---------------+------------------+------------------+\r\n\r\n  The only form that requires notice is that of the conjunctive\r\n  participle. It is derived from the Apabhrarmsa form _utthiu_, to which\r\n  the dative suffix _n_ (old Marathi _ni_, _niya_) has been added.\r\n\r\n  Various tenses are formed by adding personal suffixes to the present,\r\n  past or future passive participle. When the subject of the verb is in\r\n  the nominative the tense so formed agrees with it in gender, number\r\n  and person. We may note four such tenses: a present, _uth^ato_, I\r\n  rise; a past, _uth^alo_, I rose; past conditional, _uth^ato_, had I\r\n  risen; and a subjunctive, _uthawa_, I should rise. In the present, the\r\n  terminations are relics of the verb substantive, and in the other\r\n  tenses of the personal pronouns. In these latter, as there is no\r\n  pronoun of the third person, the third persons have no termination,\r\n  but are simply the unmodified participle. We thus get the present and\r\n  the past conjugated as follows, with a masculine subject:--\r\n\r\n    +---+----------------------+---------------------+\r\n    |   |   Present, I rise.   |    Past, I rose.    |\r\n    |   +-----------+----------+-----------+---------+\r\n    |   | Singular. |  Plural. | Singular. | Plural. |\r\n    |   +-----------+----------+-----------+---------+\r\n    | 1 | uth^ato   | uth^ato  | uth^alo   | uth^alo |\r\n    | 2 | uth^atos  | uth^ata  | uth^alas  | uth^ala |\r\n    | 3 | uth^ato   | uth^atat | uth^ala   | uth^ale |\r\n    +---+-----------+----------+-----------+---------+\r\n\r\n  The feminine and neuter forms differ from the above: thus, _uth^ates_,\r\n  thou (fem.) risest; _uth^alis_, thou (fem.) didst rise; and so on for\r\n  the other persons and for the neuter.\r\n\r\n  It will be observed that, in the case of transitive verbs, while the\r\n  present participle is active, the past and future passive participles\r\n  are passive in meaning. The same is the case with the future passive\r\n  participle of the intransitive verb. In tenses, therefore, formed from\r\n  these participles the sentence must be construed passively. The\r\n  subject must be put into the instrumental case, and the participle\r\n  inflected to agree with the object. If the object is not expressed,\r\n  or, as is sometimes the case, is expressed in the guise of a kind of\r\n  ethic dative, the participle is construed impersonally, and is\r\n  employed in the neuter form. Thus (present tense) _mul^aga_ (nom.\r\n  masc.) _pothi vacito_, the boy reads a book, but (past tense)\r\n  _mul^agyane_ (instrumental _pothi_ (nom. fem.) _vacili_ (fem.) the boy\r\n  read a book, literally, by-the-boy a-book was-read; or _mul^agyane\r\n  pothila_ (dative) _vacile_ (neuter), the boy read the book, literally,\r\n  by-the-boy, with-reference-to-the-book, it-(impersonal)-was-read.\r\n  Similarly in the subjunctive formed from the future passive\r\n  participle, _mul^agyane pothi vacawi_, the boy should read a book\r\n  (by-the-boy a-book is-to-be-read) or _mul^agyane pothila vacawe_, the\r\n  boy should read the book [by-the-boy with-reference-to-the-book, it\r\n  (impersonal)-is-to-be-read]. As an example of the subjunctive of an\r\n  intransitive verb, we have _twa uthawe_, by-thee it-is-to-be-risen,\r\n  thou shouldst rise. As in intransitive verbs the passive sense is not\r\n  so strong, in their case the tense may also be used actively, as in\r\n  _tu uthawas_, thou shouldst rise, _lit._, thou (art) to-be-risen. It\r\n  will be noted that when a participle is used passively it takes no\r\n  personal suffix.\r\n\r\n  We have seen that the present tense is formed by compounding the\r\n  present participle with the verb substantive. Further tenses are\r\n  similarly made by suffixing, without compounding, various tenses of\r\n  the verb substantive to the various participles. Thus _mi uthat ahe_,\r\n  I am rising; _mi uthat hoto_, I was rising; _mya uthave hote_\r\n  (impersonal construction), I should have risen. In the case of tenses\r\n  formed from the past participle, the auxiliary is appended, not to the\r\n  participle, but to the past tense, as in _mi uth^alo ahe_, I have\r\n  risen; _mya marila ahe_ (personal passive construction) or _mya\r\n  marile_ ahe (impersonal passive construction), I have killed.\r\n  Similarly _mi uth^alo hoto_ (active construction), I had risen. The\r\n  usual forms of the present and past of the verb substantive are:--\r\n\r\n    +---+---------------------+---------------------+\r\n    |   |   Present, I am.    | Past, I was (masc). |\r\n    |   +-----------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n    |   | Singular. | Plural. | Singular. | Plural. |\r\n    |   +-----------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n    | 1 | ahe       | ahe     | hoto      | hoto    |\r\n    | 2 | ahes      | aha     | hotas     | hota    |\r\n    | 3 | ahe       | ahet    | hota      | hote    |\r\n    +---+-----------+---------+-----------+---------+\r\n\r\n  The past changes for gender, but the present is immutable in this\r\n  respect. _Ahe_ is usually considered to be a descendant of the\r\n  Sanskrit _asmi_, I am,[8] while _hoto_ is derived from the Pr.\r\n  _homtao_, the present participle of what corresponds to the Skr. root\r\n  _bhu_, become.\r\n\r\n  A potential passive and a causal are formed by adding _av_ to the root\r\n  of a simple verb. The former follows the first, or intransitive, and\r\n  the latter the second or transitive conjugation. The potential passive\r\n  of a neuter verb is necessarily construed impersonally. The causal\r\n  verb denotes indirect agency; thus, _kar^ane_, to do, _karav^ane_, to\r\n  cause a person to do; _tyacya-kadun mya te karavile_, I caused him to\r\n  do that, literally, by-means-of-him by-me that was-caused-to-be-done.\r\n  The potential, being passive, has the subject in the dative (cf. Latin\r\n  _mihi est ludendum_) or in the instrumental of the genitive, as in\r\n  _mala_ (dative), or _majhyane_ (instr. of _madzha_, of me),\r\n  _uth^avate_, I can rise, literally, for-me, or by-my-(action),\r\n  rising-can-be-done. So, _Ramala_, or _Ramacyane_, _pothi vac^avali_,\r\n  Ram could read a book (by R. a book could be read).\r\n\r\n  Several verbs are irregular. These must be learnt from the grammars.\r\n  Here we may mention _hone_, to become, past participle _dzhala_;\r\n  _yene_, to come, past participle _ala_; and _dzane_, to go, past\r\n  participle _gela_. There are also numerous compound verbs. One of\r\n  these, making a passive, is formed by conjugating the verb _dzane_, to\r\n  go, with the past participle of the principal verb. Thus, _marila\r\n  dzato_, he is being killed, literally, he goes killed.\r\n\r\n  _Literature._--As elsewhere in India, the modern vernacular literature\r\n  of the Maratha country arose under the influence of the religious\r\n  reformation inaugurated by Ramanuja early in the 12th century. He and\r\n  his followers taught devotion to a personal deity instead of the\r\n  pantheism hitherto prevalent. The earliest writer of whom we have any\r\n  record is Namdev (13th century), whose hymns in honour of Vithoba, a\r\n  personal form of Vishnu, have travelled far beyond the home of their\r\n  writer, and are even found in the Sikh _Àdi Granth_. Dnyanoba, a\r\n  younger contemporary, wrote a paraphrase of the Sanskrit _Bhagavad\r\n  Gita_, which is still much admired. Passing over several intermediate\r\n  writers we come to the period of the warrior Sivaji, the opponent of\r\n  Aurangzeb. He was a disciple of Ramdas (1608-1681), who exercised\r\n  great influence over him, and whose _Dasbodh_, a work on religious\r\n  duty, is a classic. Contemporary with Ramdas and Sivaji was Tukaram\r\n  (1608-1649), a Sudra by caste, and yet the greatest writer in the\r\n  language. He began life as a petty shopkeeper, and being unsuccessful\r\n  both in his business and in his family relations, he abandoned the\r\n  world and became a wandering ascetic. His _Abhangs_ or \"unbroken\"\r\n  hymns, probably so called from their indefinite length and loose,\r\n  flowing metre, are famous in the country of his birth. They are\r\n  fervent, but though abounding in excellent morality, do not rise to\r\n  any great height as poetry. Other Marathi poets who may be mentioned\r\n  are Sridhar (1678-1728), the most copious of all, who translated the\r\n  _Bhagavata Purana_, and the learned Mayura or Moropant (1729-1794),\r\n  whose works smell too much of the lamp to satisfy European standards\r\n  of criticism. Mahipati (1715-1790) was an imitator of Tukaram, but his\r\n  chief importance rests on the fact that he collected the popular\r\n  traditions about national saints, and was thus the author of the _Acta\r\n  sanctorum_ of the Marathas. Lavanis, or erotic lyrics, by various\r\n  writers, are popular, but are often more passionate than decent.\r\n  Another branch of Marathi literature is composed of _Pawadas_ or\r\n  war-ballads, mostly by nameless poets, which are sung everywhere\r\n  throughout the country. There is a small prose literature, consisting\r\n  of narratives of historical events (the so-called _Bakhars_), moral\r\n  maxims and popular tales.\r\n\r\n  In the 19th century the facilities of the printing press are\r\n  responsible for a great mass of published matter. Most of the best\r\n  works have been written in English by learned natives, upon whom the\r\n  methods of European scholarship have exercised more influence than\r\n  elsewhere in India, and have given rise to a happy combination of\r\n  western science with Oriental lore. No vernacular authors of\r\n  outstanding merit have appeared during the last century.\r\n\r\n  Konkani once had a literature of its own, which is said to have been\r\n  destroyed by the Inquisition at Goa. Temples and manuscripts were\r\n  burnt wholesale. Under Roman Catholic auspices a new literature arose,\r\n  the earliest writer being an Englishman, Thomas Stephens (Thomaz\r\n  Estevão), who came to Goa in 1579, wrote the first Konkani grammar,\r\n  and died there in 1619. Amongst other works, he was the author of a\r\n  Konkani paraphrase of the New Testament in metrical form, which has\r\n  been several times reprinted and is still a favourite work with the\r\n  native Christians. Since his time there has grown up a considerable\r\n  body of Christian literature from the pens of Portuguese missionaries\r\n  and native converts.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Marathi is fortunate in possessing the best dictionary\r\n  of any modern Indian language, J. T. Molesworth's (2nd ed., Bombay,\r\n  1857). Navalkar's (3rd ed., Bombay, 1894) is the best grammar. The\r\n  earliest students of Marathi were the Portuguese, who were familiar\r\n  only with the language as spoken on the coast, i.e. with the standard\r\n  dialect of the northern Konkan and with Konkani. They have since\r\n  devoted themselves to these two forms of speech. For the former,\r\n  reference may be made to the _Grammatica da lingua Concani no dialecto\r\n  do norte_, by J. F. da Cunha Rivara (Goa, 1858). For Konkani proper,\r\n  see A. F. X. Maffei's _Grammar_ (Mangalore, 1882) and _Dictionaries_\r\n  (ibid., 1883). These are in English. Monsenhor S. R.

In the 6th century B.C. it served\r\nas a base for Peisistratus (q.v.), who owned much property in that\r\ndistrict, for securing the rest of Attica. The plain derives its fame\r\nmainly from the battle in which the Athenians and Plataeans defeated the\r\nPersians (490 B.C.). The Persian force had been sent by King Darius to\r\npunish the Athenians for previous interferences in Asia and to restore\r\ntheir tyrant Hippias. It was probably by advice of the latter that the\r\ngenerals Datis and Artaphernes landed their troops, numbering perhaps\r\n50,000, at Marathon. The Athenians, on the recommendation of their\r\nstrategus Miltiades, resolved to meet this force in the open field, and\r\nsent out their full levy of 9000 heavy infantry under the polemarch\r\nCallimachus. They were joined on the way by 1000 Plataeans, but were\r\ndisappointed of the assistance which they expected from Sparta. From\r\ntheir station at the head of the Vrana valley, which slopes down to\r\nMarathon plain, the Athenians for some days observed the Persian army,\r\nwhich gave no sign of proceeding to attack. After some waiting,\r\nMiltiades, who seems throughout to have played a more prominent part\r\nthan his superior Callimachus, drew up the Athenian army for battle and\r\ncharged down upon the enemy, whose line was formed on the level about a\r\nmile distant. The Athenian wings, whose formation had been made\r\nspecially deep, broke the opposing divisions by their impact; the centre\r\nwas at first overborne by the superior weight of the native Persians,\r\nbut ultimately was relieved by the victorious wings, which closed in\r\nupon the Persian centre. The Persians were thereupon driven back into\r\nthe sea all along the line, and, although the majority regained their\r\nships, no less than 6400 were left dead, as against 192 Athenians. The\r\nPersian fleet, of which perhaps a detachment had been sent on before the\r\nbattle, now sailed round Cape Sunium in order to effect a landing at\r\nPhalerum, close by Athens, and with the help of traitors within the\r\nwalls to take the city by surprise. But Miltiades, who had suspected\r\nsome plot all along, and had lately been warned by a signal on Mt\r\nPentelicus which he interpreted as a message to the Persians, marched\r\nback the victorious army in time to defend Athens. The enemy, upon\r\nnoticing his presence, did not venture a second disembarcation and\r\nretired straightway out of Greek waters. The details of the battle, and\r\nthe Persian plan of campaign, are not made clear by our ancient sources,\r\nbut reconstructions have been attempted by numerous modern authorities.\r\n     (M. O. B. C.)\r\n\r\nThe tumulus or \"Soros\" was excavated by M. Stais in 1891 and 1892. A\r\nslight previous excavation had brought to light some prehistoric\r\nimplements, and it was supposed that the mound had no connexion with the\r\nbattle; but it has now been discovered that the presence of those\r\nprehistoric objects was accidental. Underlying the mound was found a\r\nstratum about 85 ft. long by 20 broad, consisting of a layer of sand,\r\nabove which lay the ashes and bones of many corpses; together with these\r\nwere the remains of many lecythi and other vases, some of them\r\ncontemporary with the Persian wars, some of them of much earlier style,\r\nand probably taken in the emergency from neighbouring cemeteries. It is\r\nconjectured with some probability that a large vase containing ashes may\r\nhave been used as the burial urn of one of the Athenian generals who\r\nfell. There was also, in the middle of the stratum, a trench for funeral\r\nofferings about 30 ft. by 3; it contained bones of beasts, with ashes\r\nand fragments of vases. There can therefore be no doubt that the tumulus\r\nwas piled up to commemorate the Athenians who fell in the battle, and\r\nthat it marks the place where the carnage was thickest. A selection from\r\nthe contents of the tumulus has been placed in the National Museum at\r\nAthens.     (E. Gr.)\r\n\r\n  See Herodotus vi. 102-117; W. M. Leake, _The Topography of Athens_\r\n  (London, 1841), ii. 203-227; R. W. Macan, _Herodotus_, iv.-vi.\r\n  (London, 1895), ii. 149-248; G. B.

See also MILTIADES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARAZION, a small seaport in the St Ives parliamentary division of\r\nCornwall, England, on the shore of Mount's Bay, 2 m. E. of Penzance,\r\nserved by the Great Western railway. Pop. (1901), 1251. A causeway of\r\nboulders and pebbles, thrown up by the sea and passable at low tide,\r\nunites Marazion with the insular St Michael's Mount (q.v.). The church\r\nof St Hilary, destroyed by fire in 1853, had a very fine spire, which\r\nhas been faithfully reproduced in the restored building. Unusual\r\narchaeological interest attaches to the churchyard. Its inscribed stones\r\ndate from the 4th century, one being in honour of Constantine the Great.\r\nAnother has Cornish lettering, which can no longer be deciphered; and\r\nthere are British and Roman crosses. Market gardening and fishing are\r\nthe main industries.\r\n\r\nThe charter attributed to Robert count of Mortain, granting lands and\r\nliberties to St Michael's Mount, opposite Marazion, included a market on\r\nThursdays. This appears to have been held from the first on the\r\nmainland. From it is probably derived the Marghasbigan (_Parvum Forum_)\r\nof the earlier and the Marghasyewe or Marketjew (_Forum Jovis_) of the\r\nlater charters. It may be added that a Jewish origin has been ascribed\r\nto the place from the name Marketjew. It is certain that Richard king of\r\nthe Romans provided that the three fairs, on the two feasts of St\r\nMichael and at Mid-Lent, and the three markets which had hitherto been\r\nheld by the priors of St Michael's Mount on land not their own at\r\nMarghasbighan, should in future be held on their own land at Marchadyou.\r\nHe transferred in fact the fairs and markets from the demesne lands of\r\nthe Bloyous in Marazion to those of the prior. To remedy the loss\r\nincurred by this measure Ralph Bloyou in 1331 procured for himself and\r\nhis heirs a market on Mondays and a fair on the vigil, feast and morrow\r\nof St Andrew at Marghasyon. In Leland's time the market was held at\r\nMarhasdeythyow (_Forum Jovis_), and both Norden (1582) and Carew (1602)\r\ntell us that Marcajewe signifies the Thursday's market, which, whether\r\netymologically sound or not, shows that the prior's market had prevailed\r\nover its rival. In 1595 Queen Elizabeth granted to Marazion a charter of\r\nincorporation. This ratified the grant of St Andrew's fair, provided for\r\nanother on the Feast of St Barnabas and established a market on\r\nSaturdays. The corporation was to consist of a mayor, 8 aldermen and 12\r\ncapital burgesses. This corporation continued to administer the affairs\r\nof the borough until it was dissolved under the Municipal Corporations\r\nAct in 1835, when the property belonging to it was vested in charity\r\ncommissioners. The chairman of the commissioners retains possession of\r\nthe regalia. Of the fairs only the Michaelmas fair has survived and all\r\nthe markets have gone. It is frequently stated that Marazion had\r\nformerly the right of returning two members to parliament, but that\r\nowing to its inability to pay the members' expenses the right was lost.\r\nUnder the Commonwealth an attempt was made to secure or recover the\r\nright, and two members are said to have been returned, but they were not\r\nallowed to take their seats. Remains of an ancient bronze furnace,\r\ndiscovered near the town, tend to prove that tin-smelting was practised\r\nhere at an early period. Marazion was once a flourishing town, and owed\r\nits prosperity to the throng of pilgrims who came to visit St Michael's\r\nMount. During the first half of the 16th century it was twice plundered;\r\nfirst by the French, and later by the Cornish rebels. The rise and\r\nprogress of the neighbouring borough of Penzance in the 17th century was\r\nthe undoing of Marazion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBLE (from Lat. _marmar_, Gr. [Greek: marmaros], shining stone), a\r\nterm applied to any limestone or dolomite which is sufficiently close in\r\ntexture to admit of being polished. Many other ornamental stones--such\r\nas serpentine, alabaster and even granite--are sometimes loosely\r\ndesignated marble, but by accurate writers the term is invariably\r\nrestricted to those crystalline and compact varieties of carbonate of\r\nlime (occasionally with carbonate of magnesia) which, when polished, are\r\napplicable to purposes of decoration. The crystalline structure is\r\ntypically shown in statuary marble. A fractured surface of this stone\r\ndisplays a multitude of sparkling facets, which are the rhombohedral\r\ncleavage-planes of the component grains. The beautiful lustre of\r\npolished statuary marble is due to the light penetrating for a short\r\ndistance into the rock and then suffering reflection at the surfaces of\r\nthe deeper-lying crystals. The durability of marble in a dry atmosphere\r\nor when protected from rain renders it a valuable building stone (q.v.);\r\non the other hand, when exposed to the weather or the acid atmosphere of\r\nlarge cities, its surface readily crumbles.\r\n\r\n_Statuary and Economic Marbles._--Among statuary marbles the first place\r\nmay be assigned to the famous Pentelic marble, the material in which\r\nPheidias, Praxiteles, and other Greek sculptors executed their principal\r\nworks. The characteristics of this stone are well seen in the Elgin\r\nmarbles, which were removed from the Parthenon at Athens, and are now at\r\nthe British Museum. The marble was derived from the quarries of Mount\r\nPentelicus in Attica. Several large buildings have recently been\r\nconstructed with this marble in London. The neighbouring mountain of\r\nHymettus likewise yielded marbles, but these were neither so pure in\r\ncolour nor so fine in texture as those of Pentelicus. Parian marble,\r\nanother stone much used by Greek sculptors and architects, was quarried\r\nin the isle of Paros, chiefly at Mount Marpessa. It is called by ancient\r\nwriters _lychnites_ (from the Gr. [Greek: lychnos], a lamp) in allusion\r\nto the fact that the quarries were worked by the light of lamps. The\r\nVenus de' Medici is a notable example of work in this material. Carrara\r\nmarble is better known than any of the Greek marbles, inasmuch as it\r\nconstitutes the stone invariably employed by the best sculptors of the\r\npresent day. This marble occurs abundantly in the Apuan Alps, an\r\noffshoot of the Apennines, and is largely worked in the neighbourhood of\r\nCarrara, Massa and Serravezza. Stone from this district was employed in\r\nRome for architectural purposes in the time of Augustus, but the finer\r\nvarieties, adapted to the needs of the sculptor, were not discovered\r\nuntil some time later. It is in Carrara marble that the finest works of\r\nMichelangelo and of Canova are executed. The purest varieties of this\r\nstone are of snow-white colour and of fine saccharoidal texture. Silica\r\nis disseminated through some of the marble, becoming a source of\r\nannoyance to the workman; while occasionally it separates as beautifully\r\npellucid crystals of quartz known as \"Carrara diamonds.\" The geological\r\nage of the marbles of the Apuan Alps has been a subject of much dispute,\r\nsome geologists regarding them as metamorphosed Triassic, Liassic or\r\nRhaetic rocks. Much of the common marble is of a bluish colour, and\r\ntherefore unfit for statuary purposes; when streaked with blue and grey\r\nveins the stone is known as _bardiglio_. Curiously enough, the common\r\nwhite marble of Tuscany comes to England as Sicilian marble--a name\r\nprobably due to its having been formerly re-shipped from some port in\r\nSicily.\r\n\r\nAlthough crystalline marbles fit for statuary work are not found to any\r\nextent in Great Britain, the limestones of the Palaeozoic formations\r\nyield a great variety of marbles well suited for architectural purposes.\r\nThe Devonian rocks of south Devon are rich in handsome marbles,\r\npresenting great diversity of tint and pattern. Plymouth, Torquay,\r\nIpplepen, Babbacombe and Chudleigh may be named as the principal\r\nlocalities. Many of these limestones owe their beauty to the fossil\r\ncorals which they contain, and are hence known as \"madrepore marbles.\"\r\n\r\nOf far greater importance than the marbles of the Devonian system are\r\nthose of Carboniferous age. It is from the Carboniferous or Mountain\r\nLimestone that British marbles are mainly derived. Marbles of this age\r\nare worked in Derbyshire and Yorkshire, in the neighbourhood of Bristol,\r\nin North Wales, in the Isle of Man, and in various parts of Ireland. One\r\nof the most beautiful of these stones is the \"encrinital marble,\" a\r\nmaterial which owes its peculiarities to the presence of numerous\r\nencrinites, or stone-lilies. These fossils, when cut in various\r\ndirections, give a characteristic pattern to the stone. The joints of\r\nthe stems and arms are known from their shape as \"wheel-stones,\" and the\r\nrock itself has been called \"entrochal marble.\" The most beautiful\r\nvarieties are those in which the calcareous fossils appear as white\r\nmarkings on a ground of grey limestone. In Belgium a black marble with\r\nsmall sections of crinoid stems is known as _petit granit_, while in\r\nDerbyshire a similar rock, crowded with fragments of minute encrinites,\r\nis termed \"bird's-eye marble.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most generally useful marbles yielded by the Carboniferous\r\nsystem are the black varieties, which are largely employed for\r\nchimney-pieces, vases, and other ornamental objects. The colour of most\r\nblack limestone is due to the presence of bituminous matter. Such\r\nlimestone commonly emits a fetid odour when struck; and the colour,\r\nbeing of organic origin, is discharged on calcination. Black marbles,\r\nmore or less dense in colour, are quarried in various parts of Ireland,\r\nespecially at Kilkenny and near Galway, but the finest kind is obtained\r\nfrom near Ashford in Derbyshire. From Ashford is also derived a very\r\nbeautiful stone known as \"rosewood marble.\" This is a dense brown\r\nlaminated limestone, displaying when polished a handsome pattern\r\nsomewhat resembling the grain of rosewood; it occurs in very limited\r\nquantity, and is used chiefly for inlaid work. The black marble of\r\nFrosterley, Yorkshire, is another Carboniferous example which owes its\r\n\"figure\" or pattern to the presence of large corals.\r\n\r\nWith the rosewood marble may be compared the well-known \"landscape\r\nmarble\" or Cotham stone, an argillaceous limestone with peculiar\r\ndendritic markings, due probably to the infiltration of water containing\r\noxide of manganese. This limestone occurs in irregular masses near the\r\nbase of the White Lias, or uppermost division of the Rhaetic series. It\r\nis found principally in the neighbourhood of Bristol. The arborescent\r\nforms depicted in bluish-grey upon this landscape marble form a marked\r\ncontrast to the angular markings of warm brown colour which are seen on\r\nslabs of \"ruin marble\" from Florence--a stone occasionally known also as\r\nlandscape stone, or _pietra paesina_.\r\n\r\nBritish limestones of Secondary and Tertiary age are not generally\r\ncompact enough to be used as marbles, but some of the shelly beds are\r\nemployed to a limited extent for decorative purposes. \"Ammonite marble\"\r\nis a dark brown limestone from the Lower Lias of Somersetshire, crowded\r\nwith ammonites, principally _A. planicostata_. Under the name of Forest\r\nmarble, geologists recognize a local division of the Lower Oolitic\r\nseries, so named by W. Smith from Wychwood Forest in Oxfordshire, where\r\nshelly limestones occur; and these, though of little economic value, are\r\ncapable of being used as rough marbles. But the most important marbles\r\nof the Secondary series are the shelly limestones of the Purbeck\r\nformation. Purbeck marble was a favourite material with medieval\r\narchitects, who used it freely for slender clustered columns and for\r\nsepulchral monuments. It consists of a mass of the shells of a\r\nfresh-water snail, _Paludina carinifera_, embedded in a blue, grey or\r\ngreenish limestone, and is found in the Upper Purbeck beds of Swanage in\r\nDorsetshire. Excellent examples of its use may be seen in Westminster\r\nAbbey and in the Temple Church, as well as in the cathedrals of\r\nSalisbury, Winchester, Worcester and Lincoln. Sussex marble is a very\r\nsimilar stone, occurring in thin beds in the Weald clay, and consisting\r\nlargely of the shells of _Paludina_, principally _P. sussexiensis_ and\r\n_P. fluviorum_. The altar stones and the episcopal chair in Canterbury\r\nCathedral are of this material.\r\n\r\nCertain calcareous metamorphic rocks frequently form stones which are\r\nsufficiently beautiful to be used for ornamental purposes, and are\r\ngenerally classed as marbles. Such serpentinous limestones are included\r\nby petrologists under the term \"ophicalcite.\" The famous _verde antico_\r\nis a rock of this character. Mona marble is an ophicalcite from the\r\nmetamorphic series of the Isle of Anglesey, while the \"Irish green\" of\r\narchitects is a similar rock from Connemara in western Galway. It is\r\nnotable that some of the \"white marble\" of Connemara has been found by\r\nW. King and T. H. Rowney to consist almost wholly of malacolite, a\r\nsilicate of calcium and magnesium.\r\n\r\nA beautiful marble has been worked to a limited extent in the island of\r\nTiree, one of the Hebrides, but the quarry appears to be now exhausted.\r\nThis Tiree marble is a limestone having a delicate carnelian colour\r\ndiffused through it in irregular patches, and containing rounded\r\ncrystals of sahlite, a green augitic mineral resembling malacolite in\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nMany marbles which are prized for the variegated patterns they display\r\nowe these patterns to their formation in concentric zones--such marbles\r\nbeing in fact stalagmitic deposits of carbonate of lime, sometimes\r\nconsisting of aragonite. One of the most beautiful stalagmitic rocks is\r\nthe so-called onyx marble of Algeria. This stone was largely used in the\r\nbuildings of Carthage and Rome, but the quarries which yielded it were\r\nnot known to modern sculptors until 1849, when it was rediscovered near\r\nOued-Abdallah. The stone is a beautifully translucent material,\r\ndelicately clouded with yellow and brown, and is greatly prized by\r\nFrench workmen. Large deposits of a very fine onyx-like marble, similar\r\nto the Algerian stone, have been worked at Técali, about 35 miles from\r\nthe city of Mexico. Among other stalagmitic marbles, mention may be made\r\nof the well-known Gibraltar stone, which is often worked into models of\r\ncannon and other ornamental objects. This stalagmite is much deeper in\r\ncolour and less translucent than the onyx marbles of Algeria and Mexico.\r\nA richly tinted stalagmitic stone worked in California is known as\r\nCalifornian marble. It is worth noting that the \"alabaster\" of the\r\nancients was stalagmitic carbonate of lime, and that this stone is\r\ntherefore called by mineralogists \"Oriental alabaster\" in order to\r\ndistinguish it from our modern \"alabaster,\" which is a sulphate, and not\r\na carbonate, of lime. Gypsum capable of taking a polish is found at\r\nFauld in Staffordshire and in Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe brown and yellow colours which stalagmitic marbles usually present\r\nare due to the presence of oxide of iron. This colouring matter gives\r\nspecial characters to certain stones, such as the _giallo antico_, or\r\nantique yellow marble of the Italian antiquaries. Siena marble is a\r\nreddish mottled stone obtained from the neighbourhood of Siena in\r\nTuscany; and a somewhat similar stone is found in King's County,\r\nIreland. True red marble is by no means common, but it does occur, of\r\nbright and uniform colour, though in very small quantity, in the\r\nCarboniferous limestone of Derbyshire and north-east Staffordshire. The\r\nred marble called _rosso antico_ is often confounded with the _porfiro\r\nrosso antico_, which is really a mica-hornblende porphyrite owing its\r\nred colour to the mineral withamite.\r\n\r\nFire marble is the name given to a brown shelly limestone containing\r\nammonites and other fossil shells, which present a brilliant display of\r\niridescent colours, like those of precious opal. It occurs in rocks of\r\nLiassic age at the lead-mines of Bleiberg in Carinthia, and is worked\r\ninto snuff-boxes and other small objects. By mineralogists it is often\r\ntermed _lumachella_, an Italian name which may, however, be\r\nappropriately applied to any marble which contains small shells.\r\n\r\nThe quarries of France, Belgium, Italy and Spain, not to mention less\r\nimportant localities, yield a great diversity of marbles, and almost\r\neach stone bears a distinctive name, often of trivial meaning; but in\r\nthis article it is impossible to enumerate the local names used by\r\nmarble-workers in different countries to distinguish the various stones\r\nwhich pass under their hands.\r\n\r\nAmerica possesses some valuable deposits of marble, which in the eastern\r\nStates have been extensively worked. The crystalline limestones of\r\nwestern New England furnish an abundance of white and grey marble, while\r\na beautiful material fit for statuary work has been quarried near\r\nRutland in Vermont. A grey bird's-eye marble is obtained from central\r\nNew York, and the greyish clouded limestones of Thomaston in Maine have\r\nbeen extensively quarried. Of the variegated and coloured marbles,\r\nperhaps the most beautiful are those from the northern part of Vermont,\r\nin the neighbourhood of Lake Champlain. A fine brecciated marble is\r\nfound on the Maryland side of the Potomac, below Point of Rocks. Among\r\nthe principal localities for black marble may be mentioned Shoreham in\r\nVermont and Glen Falls in New York. In 1908 the American States\r\nproducing marble were, in order of value, Vermont, Georgia, Tennessee,\r\nNew York, Massachusetts, Alabama, Pennsylvania, Maryland, California,\r\nColorado, Alaska, N. Carolina, Kentucky, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri and\r\nIdaho. In Canada the crystalline limestones of the pre-Cambrian series\r\nyield beautiful marbles.\r\n\r\nIn India we find important quarries at Makrana in Rajputana,--a locality\r\nwhich is said to have yielded the marble for the famous Taj Mahal at\r\nAgra. In the valley of the Nerbudda, near Jabalpur, there is a large\r\ndevelopment of marble. The white marble which is used for the delicately\r\npierced screens called _jalee_ work is obtained from near Raialo, in\r\nUlwar.     (F. W. R.*)\r\n\r\n  _Petrography._--Marbles are uniformly crystalline, and hence have no\r\n  bedding or schistosity which would tend to make them fissile, but are\r\n  entirely massive and free from grain. The microstructure of pure\r\n  marble is comparatively simple. In thin sections they are seen to be\r\n  built up of somewhat rounded grains of calcite, fitting closely\r\n  together in a mosaic; very rarely do any grains show traces of\r\n  crystalline form. They are colourless and transparent, and are usually\r\n  traversed by a lattice-work of sharply defined cleavage cracks, which\r\n  correspond to the rhombohedral faces. In polarized light the colours\r\n  are pinkish or greenish white, or in very thin sections iridescent\r\n  because the mineral has a very strong double refraction. They may also\r\n  be crossed by bars or stripes, each of which indicates a twin plate,\r\n  for the crystals are usually polysynthetic. This twinning may be\r\n  produced by pressure acting either during the crystallization of the\r\n  rock or at a later period.\r\n\r\n  The purest marbles generally contain some accessory minerals, and in\r\n  many of these rocks they form a considerable proportion of the whole\r\n  mass. The commonest are quartz in small rounded grains, scales of\r\n  colourless or pale yellow mica (muscovite and phlogopite), dark\r\n  shining flakes of graphite and small crystals of pyrites or iron\r\n  oxides. Even fine Carrara marble leaves a residue of this sort when\r\n  dissolved in acid. Many marbles contain other minerals which are\r\n  usually silicates of lime or magnesia. The list of these accessories\r\n  is a very large one. Augite is very frequent and may be white\r\n  (malacolite) or pale green (coccolite, sahlite, diopside); hornblende\r\n  occurs as white bladed tremolite or pale green actinolite; feldspars\r\n  may be present also, such as orthoclase, or more frequently some\r\n  plagioclase such as albite, labradorite and anorthite; scapolite (or\r\n  wernerite); various kinds of garnet; vesuvianite, spinel, forsterite,\r\n  periclase, brucite, talc, zoisite and epidote, chondrodite, biotite,\r\n  datolite, sphene and apatite may be mentioned as typical accessory\r\n  minerals. The presence of metalliferous minerals such as galena, grey\r\n  or red silver ores, zinc blende, antimonite, chalcopyrite,\r\n  molybdenite, cassiterite, usually indicates impregnation by\r\n  ore-bearing solutions, especially if these substances occur in\r\n  workable quantities. The rubies of Burma are found in crystalline\r\n  limestones and are constantly accompanied by precious spinel (or\r\n  balas-ruby).\r\n\r\n  These minerals represent impurities in the original limestone which\r\n  crystallized at the time that the marble became crystalline. The\r\n  silicates derive their silica mainly from sand or infiltrated\r\n  siliceous deposits; the alumina represents an admixture of clay; the\r\n  iron came from limonite or hematite in the original state of the rock.\r\n  Where the silicates bulk largely because the original limestone was\r\n  highly impure, all the carbonic acid may be driven out and replaced by\r\n  silica during the process of recrystallization. The rock is then a\r\n  calc-silicate rock, hard, tough, flinty and no longer readily soluble\r\n  in acids. They are sometimes fine-grained hornstones (known as\r\n  calc-silicate hornfelses). Where white minerals predominate\r\n  (wollastonite, tremolite, feldspar) these rocks may have a close\r\n  resemblance to marbles, but often they are green from the abundance of\r\n  green augites and amphiboles, or brown (when garnet and vesuvianite\r\n  are present in quantity) or yellow (with epidote, chondrodite or\r\n  sphene). Decomposition induces further changes in colour owing to the\r\n  formation of green or yellow serpentine, pale green talc, red\r\n  hematite, and brown limonite. Most of the coloured or variegated\r\n  crystalline marbles have originated in this manner. Often bands of\r\n  calc-silicate rock alternate with bands of marble, and they may be\r\n  folded or bent; in other cases, nodules and patches of silicates occur\r\n  in a matrix of pure marble. Earth movements may shatter the rocks,\r\n  producing fissures afterwards filled with veins of calcite; in this\r\n  way the beautiful brecciated or veined marbles are produced. Sometimes\r\n  the broken fragments are rolled and rounded by the flow of the marble\r\n  under pressure and pseudo-conglomerates or \"crush conglomerates\"\r\n  result. In other cases the banding of the marble indicates the\r\n  original bedding of the calcareous sediments. Crystalline limestones\r\n  which contain much mica may be called cipollins; in them quartz,\r\n  garnet and hornblende often also occur. The ophicalcites are marbles\r\n  containing much serpentine, which has been formed by the decomposition\r\n  of forsterite, olivine or augite. The much-discussed _Eozoon_, at one\r\n  time supposed to be the earliest known fossil and found in Archaean\r\n  limestones in Canada, is now known to be inorganic and to belong to\r\n  the ophicalcites.\r\n\r\n  Many marbles, probably all of them, are metamorphosed limestones. The\r\n  passage of limestones rich in fossils into true marbles as they\r\n  approach great crystalline intrusions of granite is a phenomenon seen\r\n  in many parts of the world; occasionally the recrystallization of the\r\n  rock has not completely obliterated the organic structures (e.g. at\r\n  Carrara and at Bergen in Norway). The agencies which have induced the\r\n  metamorphism are heat and pressure, the heat arising from the granite\r\n  and the pressure from overlying masses of rock, for these changes took\r\n  place before the granite cooled and while it was still deeply buried\r\n  beneath the surface. In 1806 Sir James Hall described a series of\r\n  experiments proving this. He enclosed chalk in a gun-barrel securely\r\n  plugged and heated it to a high temperature in a furnace. Carbonic\r\n  acid was given off by the chalk and produced a great pressure in the\r\n  interior of the tube. After slow cooling the mass was found to have\r\n  become converted into granular crystalline marble. As rocks which have\r\n  undergone changes of this kind are commonest in the oldest and deepest\r\n  layers of the earth's crust, most marbles are Palaeozoic or\r\n  pre-Cambrian. They occur very often with mica schists, phyllites,\r\n  &c., which were beds of clay alternating with the original limestone.\r\n  Formerly it was supposed that some of these marbles were crystalline\r\n  sediments or even igneous rocks, but the tendency of modern geology is\r\n  to assume that they were ordinary limestones, many of which may have\r\n  been fossiliferous. In regions where the sedimentary rocks have been\r\n  converted into schists, gneisses and granulites, the limestones are\r\n  represented by calc schists, cipollins and marbles. Often no granite\r\n  or other intrusive rock is present which may be regarded as the cause\r\n  of the metamorphism. The marbles are often banded or schistose, and\r\n  under the microscope show crushing and deformation of the component\r\n  crystals, such as would have been produced by the earth pressures\r\n  which accompany rock-folding. These crush structures have been\r\n  obtained experimentally in marbles subjected to great pressures in\r\n  steel cylinders. In the recrystallization of these limestones the\r\n  direct heating action of igneous intrusions may have played no part,\r\n  but the rise of temperature and increase of pressure due to the\r\n  folding of great rock masses have probably been the operating causes.\r\n  This type of metamorphism has been distinguished by the name\r\n  _marmarosis_ (Sir A. Geikie, _Text Book of Geology_, 1882).\r\n\r\n  For descriptions of ancient marbles see F. Corsi, _Delle pietre\r\n  antiche_ (Rome, 1845); M. W. Porter, _What Rome was built with_\r\n  (Oxford, 1907), and for marbles in general consult E. Hull, _Building\r\n  and Ornamental Stones_ (1872); G. P. Merrill, _Stones for Building and\r\n  Decoration_ (3rd ed., 1905, New York).     (J. S. F.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBLEHEAD, a township of Essex county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., occupying\r\na rocky promontory on Massachusetts Bay, about 16 m. N. of Boston. Pop.\r\n(1890), 8202; (1900), 7582; (1905), 7209; (1910), 7338. Area, about 4\r\nsq. m. Marblehead is served by the Boston & Maine railroad, and by\r\nelectric railways connecting with Salem, Lynn and Boston. It is a quaint\r\nold town, with a number of houses dating back to the 17th and 18th\r\ncenturies. Among the older buildings are the Lee mansion (1768), St\r\nMichael's church (P. E., 1714), and the old town-hall (1727), sometimes\r\ncalled Marblehead's \"Cradle of Liberty.\" Abbot Hall (1877), the\r\nmunicipal building, also contains the public library and several\r\nnoteworthy paintings, including \"The Spirit of '76\" or \"Yankee Doodle\"\r\nby Archibald M. Willard. The post office and custom-house was completed\r\nin 1904. There are several parks (Crocker, Fort Sewall, Seaside, and\r\nFountain), and an old burying-ground, in which many of the early\r\nsettlers and a number of soldiers of the War of Independence (including\r\nGeneral John Glover) are buried; and a granite monument near the railway\r\nstation commemorates the taking of the British supply and powder ship\r\n\"Hope\" off Marblehead in 1776 by Captain James Mugford, who was killed\r\nduring the fight. The commodious harbour, nearly landlocked, is formed\r\nby a rocky peninsula known as Marblehead Neck. On this are the\r\nclub-houses of the Eastern and Corinthian Yacht clubs; and Marblehead is\r\na popular yachting centre. The manufacture of children's shoes is the\r\nprincipal industry. Shipbuilding, once important, has been superseded by\r\nyacht and launch construction.\r\n\r\nMarblehead, originally a part of Salem, known as Marble Harbor, was\r\nsettled about 1629 by English emigrants (probably mostly from\r\nLincolnshire and Devonshire); later (after about 1700) many emigrants\r\nfrom the Channel Islands settled here, and to them the dialectical\r\npeculiarities of Marblehead have often (perhaps mistakenly) been\r\nattributed. Marblehead was separately incorporated as a town in 1649. In\r\nthe colonial period Marblehead was an important commercial port, and at\r\none time was one of the most populous places in Massachusetts. After the\r\npassage of the Boston Port Bill (1774) it was made the port of entry\r\ninstead of Boston, but its merchants refused to take advantage of this\r\nopportunity and patriotically invited the Boston merchants to use their\r\nwharves and warehouses. During the War of Independence many \"state\r\ncruisers\" (chartered at the Continental expense) set out from this port,\r\nthe most famous being the \"Lee,\" commanded by John Manley[1] (1733-93);\r\nin November 1775 this cruiser captured the \"Nancy\" with military stores\r\nvalued at £20,541, which were taken to the American army at Cambridge.\r\nThe \"Lee\" was manned by fifty men of the \"amphibious regiment,\" which\r\nunder General John Glover (1732-1797) rendered invaluable services to\r\nWashington in conveying his troops across the East River after the\r\nbattle of Long Island, and later in ferrying them across the Delaware\r\nbefore the battle of Trenton. Marblehead furnished more than 1000 men to\r\nthe Continental army. During the war of 1812 the sea fight between the\r\n\"Chesapeake\" and the \"Shannon\" took place (June 1, 1813) off the\r\nadjacent coast. Marblehead was the scene of Benjamin (nicknamed \"Flood\")\r\nIreson's ride, immortalized by J. G. Whittier.\r\n\r\n  See Samuel Roads, jun., _The History and Traditions of Marblehead_\r\n  (Boston, 1880; 3rd ed., Marblehead, 1897).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] See Robert E. Peabody, \"Naval Career of Captain John Manley of\r\n    Marblehead\", in _Essex Institute Historical Collections_ (Salem,\r\n    Mass.) for January 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBLES, a children's game of great antiquity, wide distribution, and\r\nuncertain origin, played with small spheres of stone, glass, baked clay\r\nor other material, from one-third of an inch to two inches in diameter.\r\nThe game was once popular with all classes. Tradition, both at Oxford\r\nand Cambridge, attests that the game was formerly prohibited among\r\nundergraduates on the steps of the Bodleian or the Senate House. There\r\nis a similar tradition at Westminster School that the boys were\r\nforbidden to play marbles in Westminster Hall on account of the\r\ncomplaints made by members of parliament and lawyers. An anonymous poem\r\nof the 17th century speaks of a boy about to leave Eton as\r\n\r\n  \"A dunce at syntax, but a dab at taw.\"\r\n\r\nRogers, in _The Pleasures of Memory_, recalls how\r\n\r\n  \"On yon grey stone that fronts the chancel-door,\r\n   Worn smooth by busy feet, now seen no more,\r\n   Each eve we shot the marble through the ring.\"\r\n\r\nDefoe (1720) writes of the seer Duncan Campbell: \"Marbles, which he used\r\nto call children's playing at bowls, yielded him mighty diversion; and\r\nhe was so dexterous an artist at shooting that little alabaster globe\r\nfrom between the end of his forefinger and the knuckle of his thumb,\r\nthat he seldom missed hitting plumb, as the boys call it, the marble he\r\naimed at, though at the distance of two or three yards.\" The _locus\r\nclassicus_ on marbles in the 19th century is in the trial in _Pickwick_,\r\nwhere Serjeant Buzfuz pathetically says of Master Bardell that \"his\r\n'alley tors' and his 'commoneys' are alike neglected; he forgets the\r\nlong familiar cry of 'knuckle down,' and at tip-cheese, or odd and even,\r\nhis hand is out.\" Many similar passages might be adduced to prove the\r\nformer popularity of marbles with the young of all classes. In some\r\nrural parts of Sussex Good Friday was known as \"marble-day\" till late in\r\nthe 19th century, since on that day both old and young, including many\r\nwho would never have thought of playing marbles at other times, took\r\npart in the game. There was some traditional reason for regarding\r\nmarbles as a Lenten sport--perhaps, as the Rev. W. D. Parish suggests,\r\n\"to keep people from more boisterous and mischievous enjoyments.\"\r\n\r\nThe origin of the game is concealed in the mists of antiquity. Marbles\r\nused by Egyptian and Roman children before the Christian era are to be\r\nseen in the British Museum. Probably some of the small stone spheres\r\nfound among neolithic remains, which Evans (_Ancient Stone Implements_,\r\n2nd ed., p. 420) admits to be too small for projectiles, are prehistoric\r\nmarbles. It is commonly assumed that the game which the youthful\r\nAugustus, like other Roman children, played with nuts was a form of\r\nmarbles, and that the Latin phrase of _relinquere nuces_, in the sense\r\nof putting away childish things, referred to this game. Strutt believed\r\nthat nuts of the roundest sort were the original \"marbles.\" The earliest\r\nunmistakable reference to marbles in literature seems to be in a French\r\npoem of the 12th century, quoted by Littré s.v. _Bille_.\r\n\r\nThe marbles with which various games are nowadays played are small\r\nspheres of stone, glass or baked clay. In the 18th century they were\r\nmostly made from chips of marble (whence the name) or other stone, which\r\nwere ground into a roughly spherical shape by attrition in a special\r\niron mill. Nuremberg was then the centre of the trade in marbles, though\r\nsome were made in Derbyshire, and indeed wherever there was a\r\nstonemason's yard to afford raw material. The \"alley taw,\" as its name\r\nindicates, was made of alabaster. In the first decade of the 20th\r\ncentury English marbles were all imported from central Germany, and the\r\nalleys, or most valuable marbles, used for shooting, were mostly made of\r\ncoloured glass, sold retail from ten a penny to a penny each. Coloured\r\nstone marbles and so-called china marbles--really of baked clay--were\r\nsold at prices varying from forty to a hundred a penny, though even the\r\ncheapest of these were painted by hand with concentric rings. The\r\nwell-made and highly valued alleys of earlier times were no longer\r\nprocurable, owing to the decline in popularity of the sport. In the\r\nUnited States, however, much more expensive and accurately rounded\r\nmarbles were still manufactured, the latest being of hollow steel.\r\n\r\n  There has never been any recognized authority on the game of marbles,\r\n  and it is probable that, in the past as in the present, every parish\r\n  and school and set of boys made its own rules. There are, however,\r\n  three or four distinct games which are traditional, and may be found,\r\n  with trifling variations, wherever the game is played. Strutt, writing\r\n  at the end of the 18th century, describes these as follows: (1) \"Taw,\r\n  wherein a number of boys put each of them one or two marbles in a ring\r\n  and shoot at them alternately with other marbles, and he who obtains\r\n  the most of them by beating them out of the ring is the conqueror.\"\r\n  The marbles placed in the ring--whence the game is often known as\r\n  \"ring-taw\"--are usually of the cheaper kind known as \"commoneys,\"\r\n  \"stoneys\" or \"potteys,\" and the marble with which the player shoots is\r\n  a more valuable one, known as an \"alley,\" or \"alley taw,\" sometimes\r\n  spelt \"tor,\" as by Dickens. Usually it is necessary that the alley\r\n  should emerge from the ring as well as drive out another marble; under\r\n  other rules the ring is smaller, not more than a foot in diameter, and\r\n  the player must be skilful enough to leave his alley inside it, whilst\r\n  driving the object marble outside. (2) \"Nine holes: which consists in\r\n  bowling of marbles at a wooden bridge with nine arches.\" Each arch\r\n  bears a number, and the owner of the bridge pays that number of\r\n  marbles to the player who shoots through it, making his profit from\r\n  the missing marbles, which he confiscates; or the game may simply be\r\n  played so many up--usually 100. (3) \"There is also another game of\r\n  marbles where four, five or six holes, and sometimes more, are made in\r\n  the ground at a distance from each other; and the business of every\r\n  one of the players is to bowl a marble by a regular succession into\r\n  all the holes, which he who completes in the fewest bowls obtains the\r\n  victory.\" This primitive form of golf is played by Zulu adults with\r\n  great enthusiasm, and is still popular among the car-drivers of\r\n  Belfast. (4) \"Boss out, or boss and span, also called hit and span,\r\n  wherein one bowls a marble to any distance that he pleases, which\r\n  serves as a mark for his antagonist to bowl at, whose business it is\r\n  to hit the marble first bowled, or lay his own near enough to it for\r\n  him to span the space between them and touch both marbles; in either\r\n  case he wins, if not, his marble remains where it lay and becomes a\r\n  mark for the first player, and so alternately until the game be won.\"\r\n  In rural parts of England this was known as a \"going-to-school game,\"\r\n  because it helped the players along the road.\r\n\r\n  Mr F. W. Hackwood states that, in the middle of the 19th century,\r\n  taverns in the Black Country had regular marble alleys, consisting of\r\n  a cement bed 20 ft. long by 12 ft. wide and 18 in. from the ground,\r\n  with a raised wooden rim to prevent the marbles from running off.\r\n  Players knelt down to shoot, and had to \"knuckle down\" fairly--i.e. to\r\n  place the knuckle of the shooting hand on the ground, so that the flip\r\n  of the thumb was not aided by a jerk of the wrist. The game was\r\n  usually ring-taw. But marbles is now obsolete in England as a game for\r\n  adults (_Old English Sports_, London, 1907).\r\n\r\n  A writer in _Notes and Queries_ (IX. ii. 314) thus describes the\r\n  marbles used by English boys in the middle of the 19th century: \"In\r\n  ring-taw the player put only commoneys in the ring, and shot with the\r\n  taws, which included stoneys, alleys and blood-alleys. Commoneys were\r\n  unglazed; potteys glazed in the kiln. Stoneys were made from common\r\n  pebbles such as were used for road-mending; alleys and blood-alleys\r\n  out of marble. The blood-alleys were highly prized, and were called by\r\n  this name because of the spots or streaks of red in them. In\r\n  Derbyshire, where large numbers were made, they had relative values.\r\n  The stoney was worth three commoneys or two potteys. An alley was\r\n  worth six commoneys or four potteys. Blood-alleys were worth more,\r\n  according to the depth and arrangement of colour--from twelve to fifty\r\n  commoneys and stoneys in proportion.\" \"A taw with a history was prized\r\n  above rubies,\" another correspondent observes (IX. ii. 76). \"All the\r\n  best-made marbles were taws, and no commoneys or potteys were used for\r\n  shooting with, either in ring-taw or the various hole-games.\" In\r\n  Belfast, 1854-1858, the marble season extended from Easter to June,\r\n  when the ground was usually dry and hard. The marbles were stoneys, of\r\n  composition painted; crockeries, of slightly glazed stone-ware, dark\r\n  brown and yellow; clayeys, of red brick clay baked in the fire;\r\n  marbles, of white marble; china alleys, with white glaze and painted\r\n  rings; and glass marbles. The two chief games were ring-taw and hole\r\n  and taw; in the latter three holes were made in a line, 6 ft. to 12\r\n  ft. apart, and the player had to go three times up and down according\r\n  to somewhat elaborate rules (_Notes and Queries_, IX. iii. 65). The\r\n  stoneys and crockeries were sold at twenty a penny; the clayeys were\r\n  cheaper and were not used as stakes; the marbles proper and china\r\n  alleys, used as taws for shooting, cost a halfpenny and a farthing\r\n  respectively. In other parts of the country the phraseology of marbles\r\n  affords some interesting problems for the philologist. We hear of\r\n  \"alleys, barios, poppos and stoneys\"; of \"marididdles,\" home-made\r\n  marbles of rolled and baked clay; in Scotland of \"bools, whinnies,\r\n  glassies, jauries\"; of \"Dutch alleys,\" and so forth. \"Dubs, trebs and\r\n  fobs,\" stand for twos, threes and fours. To be \"mucked\" is to lose all\r\n  one's \"mivvies\" or marbles. When the taw stayed in the ring it was a\r\n  \"chuck.\" \"Phobbo slips\" was a phrase used to forbid the correction of\r\n  an error.\r\n\r\n  The fullest account of the various games of marbles played by English\r\n  children is to be found in Mrs Gomme's _Traditional Games of England,\r\n  Scotland and Ireland_ (London, 1898), under the headings Boss-out,\r\n  Bridgeboard, Bun-hole, Cob, Ho-go, Holy Bang, Hundreds, Lag,\r\n  Long-Tawl, Marbles, Nine-Holes, Ring-taw, Three-Holes. Other games are\r\n  known as Plum-pudding, or Picking the Plums, in which one shoots at\r\n  marbles in a row; Pyramids, in which the marbles are arranged in a\r\n  pyramid; Bounce About, Bounce Eye, Conqueror, Die Shot,\r\n  Fortifications, Handers, Increase Pound, Knock Out, Rising Taw,\r\n  Spanners, Tip-shears; Strutt's _Sports and Pastimes_, ed. J. C. Cox\r\n  (London, 1902). Much information will also be found in _Notes and\r\n  Queries, passim_--especially the 9th series. For marbles in France see\r\n  Larousse, s.v. _Billes_.

F.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBOT, JEAN BAPTISTE ANTOINE MARCELIN, BARON DE (1782-1854), French\r\nsoldier, son of General Jean Antoine de Marbot (1754-1800), who died in\r\nthe defence of Genoa under Masséna, was born at La Rivière (Corrèze), on\r\nthe 18th of August 1782. He joined the republican army as a volunteer in\r\n1799, rose rapidly to commissioned rank, and was aide-de-camp to Marshal\r\nAugereau, commanding the VII. corps, in the war against Prussia and\r\nRussia in 1806-7. After this he served with great distinction in the\r\nPeninsular War under Lannes and Masséna, and showed himself to be a\r\ndashing leader of light cavalry in the Russian War of 1812 and the\r\nGerman campaign of the following year. After a slow recovery from the\r\nwounds he had received at Leipzig and Hanau, he was promoted general of\r\nbrigade by Napoleon during the Hundred Days, and took part in, and was\r\nwounded at, the battle of Waterloo. He was exiled at the second\r\nrestoration and only returned to France in 1819, after which, however,\r\nhis intimacy with the duke of Orleans secured him important military\r\npositions. After the July restoration he was made _maréchal-de-camp_,\r\nand in this rank he was present at the siege of Antwerp in 1832. He was\r\npromoted lieutenant-general in 1836. From 1835 to 1840 he served in\r\nvarious Algerian expeditions, and in 1845 he was made a member of the\r\nChamber of Peers. Three years later, at the fall of Louis Philippe, he\r\nretired into private life. He died at Paris on the 16th of November\r\n1854. Marbot wrote two pamphlets, _Remarques critiques sur l'ouvrage de\r\nM. le général Roguet, intitulé Considérations sur l'art de la guerre_\r\n(1820), and _La Nécessité d'augmenter les forces militaires de la\r\nFrance_ (1825), but his fame rests chiefly, if not indeed wholly, on the\r\nfascinating Memoirs of his _Life and Campaigns_ which were published in\r\nParis in 1891 (Eng. trans., 1902). To ordinary readers and to students\r\nof history alike these give a picture of the Napoleonic age of warfare\r\nwhich for vividness and romantic interest has never been surpassed.\r\n\r\nHis elder brother, ANTOINE ADOLPHE MARCELIN DE MARBOT (1781-1844), was\r\nborn at La Rivière, on the 22nd of March 1781, entered the army at an\r\nearly age, obtained commissioned rank in the revolutionary wars and\r\nbecame aide-de-camp to Bernadotte. In 1802 he was arrested on the ground\r\nof being concerned in a plot of the Republicans against the Consulate,\r\nbut he was released, though Napoleon continued to regard him as an\r\nopponent of the established régime. After a term of duty with the army\r\nin Santo Domingo he participated in the campaigns of 1806-7, and from\r\n1808 to 1811 he was employed in the Peninsular War. In the Russian War\r\nof 1812 he was wounded and made prisoner. At the end of two years of\r\ncaptivity he returned to France at the general peace, was aide-de-camp\r\nto Marshal Davout during the Hundred Days, and thereafter passed into\r\nretirement, from which he did not emerge till 1830. He attained the\r\nrank of _maréchal-de-camp_ under Louis Philippe, and died at Bra, near\r\nTulle, on the 2nd of June 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBURG, a town of Austria, in Styria, 41 m. S. of Graz by rail. Pop.\r\n(1900), 24,501. It is very picturesquely situated on the left bank of\r\nthe river Drave, on a plain called the Pettauer-Feld, at the base of the\r\nwell-wooded Bachergebirge. To the north of the town the train passes\r\nthrough the Leitersberg tunnel (725 yds. long), opened in 1846, while\r\nthe Drave, which has here a width of 200 yds., is spanned by a\r\nmagnificent iron bridge, built in 1845. The principal buildings are the\r\ncathedral, dating from the 16th century, the tower of which, erected in\r\n1623, is 136 ft. high, and the old castle. Its situation in the midst of\r\na fertile vine and fruit-growing district, connected by the navigable\r\nDrave with Hungary, and by railway with Vienna, Trieste, Tirol and\r\nCarinthia, makes it the centre of a considerable traffic in wine and\r\ngrain. Its industrial products are leather, boots and shoes, iron and\r\ntin wares, liqueurs and sparkling wine, and it also contains the\r\nextensive workshops of the South Austrian railway. Marburg is the seat\r\nof the bishop of Lavant, and is the native town of the famous Austrian\r\nadmiral, Baron Wilhelm of Tegetthoff (1827-1871). Near Marburg is the\r\nvillage of Mariarast, the church of which is a popular place of\r\npilgrimage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBURG, an ancient university town of Germany, in the Prussian province\r\nof Hesse-Nassau, situated on the slope of a hill on the right bank of\r\nthe Lahn, 60 m. by rail N. of Frankfort-on-Main, on the main line to\r\nCassel. Pop. (1905), 20,137. On the opposite bank of the river, here\r\nspanned by two bridges, lie the suburb of Weidenhausen and the railway\r\nstation of the Prussian state railway. The hill on which the town lies\r\nis crowned by the extensive old Schloss, a fine Gothic building, the\r\nmost noteworthy parts of which are the Rittersaal, dating from\r\n1277-1312, and the beautiful little chapel. This Schloss was formerly\r\nthe residence of the landgraves of Hesse, served afterwards as a prison,\r\nand is now the repository of the historically interesting and valuable\r\narchives of Hesse. The chief architectural ornament of Marburg is,\r\nhowever, the Elisabethenkirche, a veritable gem of the purest Early\r\nGothic style, erected by the grand master of the Teutonic Order in\r\n1235-1283, to contain the tomb of St Elizabeth of Hungary. The remains\r\nof the saint were deposited in a rich silver-gilt sarcophagus, which may\r\nstill be seen, and were afterwards visited by myriads of pilgrims, until\r\nthe Protestant zeal of Landgrave Philip the Generous caused him to\r\nremove the body to some unknown spot in the church. The church also\r\ncontains the tombs of numerous Hessian landgraves and knights of the\r\nTeutonic Order. The Lutheran church is another good Gothic edifice,\r\ndating mainly from the 15th century. The town-hall, built in 1512, and\r\nseveral fine houses in the Renaissance style, also deserve mention. The\r\nuniversity of Marburg, founded by Philip the Magnanimous in 1527, was\r\nthe first university established without papal privileges, and speedily\r\nacquired a great reputation throughout Protestant Europe. It has a\r\nlibrary of 140,000 volumes, is admirably equipped with medical and other\r\ninstitutes, which form some of the finest modern buildings in the town,\r\nand was attended, in 1905, by 1576 students. Marburg also possesses a\r\ngymnasium, a \"Realschule,\" an agricultural school, a society of\r\nnaturalists, a hospital, and an extensive lunatic asylum. It is the seat\r\nof a district court, and of superintendents of the Lutheran and Reformed\r\nChurches. Marburg pottery is renowned; and leather, iron wares and\r\nsurgical instruments are also manufactured there. The environs are very\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nMarburg is first historically mentioned in a document of the beginning\r\nof the 13th century, and received its municipal charter from the\r\nlandgrave Louis of Thuringia in 1227. On his death it became the\r\nresidence of his wife, Elizabeth of Hungary, who built a hospital there,\r\nand died in 1231, at the age of twenty-four, worn out with works of\r\nreligion and charity. She was canonized in 1235 at the instance of the\r\nTeutonic Knights, who had settled in Marburg in 1233 and were zealous in\r\npromoting her cult. By 1247 Marburg had already become the second town\r\nof Hesse, and in the 15th and 16th centuries it alternated with Cassel\r\nas the seat of the landgraves. In 1529 the famous conference between\r\nLuther and Zwingli on the subject of Transubstantiation took place there\r\nin the Rittersaal of the Schloss (see MARBURG, COLLOQUY OF). During the\r\nThirty Years' and Seven Years' Wars Marburg suffered considerably from\r\nsieges and famine. In 1806, and again in 1810, it was the centre of an\r\nabortive rising against the French, in consequence of which the\r\nfortifications of the castle were destroyed.\r\n\r\n  See Kolbe, _Marburg im Mittelalter_ (Marb., 1879); Bücking,\r\n  _Mittheilungen aus Marburgs Vorzeit_ (Marb., 1886); Schoof, _Marburg\r\n  die Perle des Hessenlandes_ (2nd ed., 1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARBURG, COLLOQUY OF (_Marburger Religionsgespräch_), the name given to\r\na conference of divines held in 1529 in the interests of the unity of\r\nProtestant Germany. The circumstances in which it was held, the\r\ninfluence of the men who conducted its deliberations, and the result of\r\nits proceedings, combine to render it of no small importance for the\r\nhistory of the Reformation in Germany.\r\n\r\nAfter the Imperial Diet of Spires in 1526 had decreed that all states of\r\nthe empire should observe the Edict of Worms (1521), banning Luther and\r\nhis adherents, in such a manner that they should not be afraid to answer\r\nit before God and the emperor, the reform movement had received such an\r\naccess of strength that the Catholic party felt itself menaced in\r\nearnest, and in 1529 again passed a resolution at Spires, deigned not\r\nmerely to preclude any further expansion of the Reformation, but even to\r\nprevent it from maintaining the ground already won. This decision was at\r\nonce challenged, on the 19th of April, by the protest of the Evangelical\r\nstates (whence the name Protestants); and the effect of this disclaimer\r\nwas not small. Still, it was devoid of political significance, unless\r\nbacked by the united force of all the princes and states subscribing to\r\nthe Evangelical teaching; and this unity was wanting. The feud which\r\nraged round the doctrine of the Lord's Supper had already broken out\r\nbefore the first diet of Spires, and had aroused great and immediate\r\nexcitement. At a very early period, however, efforts were made to allay\r\nthe dissension. Strassburg pronounced for conciliation: but the most\r\npowerful and zealous champion of peace was to be found in the landgrave\r\nPhilip of Hesse, who recognized the absolute necessity--from a political\r\nstandpoint--of the union of all German Protestants. It is probable that\r\nhe had invited Luther to a religious conference as early as the year\r\n1527; but on that occasion he met with a refusal. True, the impression\r\nconveyed by the attitude of the Catholic party at the second Diet of\r\nSpires had served to awaken the feeling for solidarity among the\r\nEvangelicals there assembled; and on the 22nd of April they had even\r\nsecured the basis for a provisional alliance in the shape of a formula\r\ndrawn up by Bucer and dealing with the Lord's Supper. But it was obvious\r\nthat a permanent coalition could not be expected unless some definite\r\nunderstanding on the debated point could be attained; and on the very\r\nsame day the landgrave despatched to Zwingli an invitation to a\r\ncolloquy, and received his prompt acquiescence. Melanchthon, who in the\r\ntension which prevailed at the synod had shown himself inclined to\r\nnegotiation, became suspicious on his return, and endeavoured to\r\ninfluence the elector of Saxony and Luther in accordance with his views.\r\nThe landgrave, however, was so far successful that the beginning of\r\nOctober (1529) saw the colloquy opened in the castle at Marburg. With\r\nZwingli, who had arrived on the 27th of September, he had several\r\ninterviews of considerable political importance before the Wittenberg\r\ndivines made their appearance. These interviews settled the\r\npreliminaries of an alliance; but they rested on the assumption that the\r\ntheological feud between Wittenberg and Zürich could be removed, or its\r\nviolence at least abated.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings opened on the 1st of October with conferences between\r\nLuther and Oecolampadius, and Melanchthon and Zwingli: then on the two\r\nfollowing days the discussion proper--confined almost entirely to Luther\r\nand Zwingli--was held before the landgrave and his guest Duke Ulrich of\r\nWürttemberg, in the presence of more than fifty persons. As regards the\r\nmain point of contention, i.e. the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, no\r\nagreement was found practicable; and the private conversations on the\r\n4th of October, which formed the sequel of the debate, carried matters\r\nno farther. \"You have another spirit,\" said Luther. Since the landgrave,\r\nhowever, was reluctant to see the colloquy brought to an absolutely\r\nfruitless close, he requested Luther to draw up a list of the most\r\nimportant points of doctrine on which it might yet be possible to arrive\r\nat some degree of unanimity. This was done on the 4th of October; and a\r\nfew alterations were introduced to meet the wishes of the Swiss\r\ndeputies. The _Articles of Marburg_, which thus came into being, contain\r\nthe doctrine of the Trinity, of the personality of Christ, of faith and\r\njustification, of the Scriptures, of baptism, of good works, of\r\nconfession, of government, of tradition, and of infant baptism. The\r\nfifteenth article, treating of the Lord's Supper, defines the ground\r\ncommon to both parties even in this debateable region, recognizing the\r\nnecessity of participation in both kinds, and rejecting the sacrifice of\r\nthe Mass. It then proceeds to fix the point of difference in the fact\r\nthat no agreement had been reached on the question \"whether the true\r\nbody and blood of Christ are corporeally present in the bread and wine\"\r\n(\"Nit vergleicht haben wir uns, ob der war leib und plut Christi\r\nleiblich im brot und wein sey\"). Nevertheless, the adherents of each\r\ndoctrine are recommended to display Christian charity to those of the\r\nother. These articles were signed by the ten official members of the\r\ncolloquy: Luther, Jonas, Melanchthon, Osiander, Agricola, Brenz,\r\nOecolampadius, Bucer, Hedio and Zwingli. The personal contact between\r\nLuther and Zwingli led to no mental _rapprochement_ between the two; but\r\nin the following year the Articles of Marburg did good service as one of\r\nthe preliminaries to the Augsburg Confession, and remain a valuable\r\ndocument for the fundamental principles common to the Lutheran and\r\nReformed Churches.\r\n\r\n  See T. Kolde, s.v. \"Marburger Religionsgespräch,\" in _Realencyklopädie\r\n  f. protestant. Theologie_, 3rd ed. xii. 248 seq.     (C. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCA, PIERRE DE (1594-1662), French prelate and historian, was born at\r\nGan, near Pau, on the 24th of January 1594. His family was known among\r\njudicial circles in the 16th century, and maintained the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith after the official introduction of the Reformed religion into\r\nNavarre. After having studied law at the university of Toulouse he\r\npractised successfully at Pau. But he was ambitious, and turned to a\r\nlarger sphere. He ardently called for the armed intervention of King\r\nLouis XIII. in Béarn, and on this occasion published his first writing,\r\n_Discours d'un Béarnais, très fidèle sujet du roi, sur l'édit du\r\nrétablissement de l'exercice de la religion catholique dans tout le\r\nBéarn_ (1618). After the easy campaign of 1620, the possessions which\r\nhad been taken by the Protestants were given back to the Roman Catholic\r\nchurch; this task was performed, under his supervision, with judgment\r\nand moderation. During the siege of La Rochelle he performed a mission\r\nwhich brought him in touch with Richelieu, who shortly afterwards\r\nnominated him _intendant de justice_ in Béarn (1631), and in 1639\r\nsummoned him to Paris with the title of counsellor of state. The\r\nfollowing year, the question of the intervention of kings in the\r\nelection of bishops having been raised in a pamphlet by Charles Hersent\r\n(_Optalus Gallus de cavendo schismate_, 1640), Marca defended what were\r\nthen called the liberties of the Gallican Church, in his celebrated\r\ntreatise _De concordia sacerdotii et imperii, seu de libertalibus\r\necclesiae gallicanae_ (1641). He was soon rewarded for this service.\r\nAlthough he had not yet taken even the minor holy orders, he was\r\nnominated bishop of Couserans by the king on the 28th of December 1641,\r\nbut the pope refused to give his sanction. It was only after Marca had\r\nformally denied those propositions contained in _De concordia_ which\r\nwere displeasing to Rome that he was proclaimed in the consistory (Jan.\r\n13, 1648). During this time, and until 1651, he was governor of the\r\nprovince of Catalonia, then occupied by the French. After the Treaty of\r\nthe Pyrenees, he was sent to direct the conference which had been formed\r\nto fix the limits of Roussillon, which had just been ceded to France\r\n(1660). Marca now interested himself in the fortunes of Mazarin, and\r\nremained faithful to him even during the Fronde. As a recompense, he\r\nwas nominated archbishop of Toulouse (May 28, 1652), but had to wait for\r\nthe bulls of investiture till the 23rd of March 1654. It was difficult\r\nfor him to please both pope and king. In the struggle against the\r\nJansenists he used all the influence he had with the clergy to secure\r\nthe passage of the apostolic constitution of the 31st of March 1653\r\n(_Relation de ce qui s'est fait depuis 1653 dans les assemblées des\r\névêques au sujet des cinq propositions_, 1657); but in the rebellion\r\nraised by Retz, archbishop of Paris, against the king, he took the part\r\nof the king against the pope. Michel Le Tellier having ordered him to\r\nrefute a thesis of the college of Clermont on the infallibility of the\r\npope, Marca wrote a treatise which was most Gallican in its ideas, but\r\nrefused to publish it for fear of drawing down \"the indignation of\r\nRome.\" These tactics were successful, and when Retz, weary of a struggle\r\nwithout definite results, resigned the archbishopric, Marca became his\r\nsuccessor (Feb. 26, 1662). He did not derive much profit from this new\r\nfavour, as he died on the 29th of June following, without his nomination\r\nhaving been sanctioned by the pope.\r\n\r\nMarca, clever and covetous, was also an historian of note. When very\r\nyoung he showed his interest in the past history of his native land, and\r\nin 1617, at the age of twenty-three, he had set to work looking through\r\narchives, copying charters, and corresponding with the principal men of\r\nlearning of his time, the brothers Dupuy, André Duchesne and Jean Besly,\r\nwhom he visited in Poitou. His _Histoire de Béarn_ was published at\r\nParis in 1640. It was not so well received as his _De concordia_, but is\r\nmore appreciated by posterity. If Marca's criticism is too often\r\nundecided, both in the ancient epochs, where he supports the text by a\r\ncertain amount of guesswork and in certain points where he touches on\r\nreligion, yet he always gives the text correctly. A number of chapters\r\nend with an interesting collection of charters. It is to be regretted\r\nthat this incomplete work does not go beyond 1300. During his long stay\r\nin Catalonia he made preparations for a geographical and historical\r\ndescription of this province, which was bound to France by so many\r\npolitical and literary associations. Baluze, who became his secretary in\r\n1656, helped him with the work and finished it, adding clever appendices\r\nand publishing the whole in 1688 under the title _Marca hispanica_.\r\n\r\nMarca married Marguerite de Forgues on the 4th of June 1618, and had one\r\nson and three daughters. His son, Galactoire, who was president of the\r\nparlement of Navarre, died on the 10th of February 1689.\r\n\r\n  Marca's biography was written in Latin by two of his intimate friends,\r\n  Étienne Baluze, his secretary (_Epistola ad Samuelem Sorbierium, de\r\n  vita, gestis et scriptis Petri de Marca_, Paris, 1663), and his\r\n  cousin, Paul de Faget (at the beginning of a collection of Marca's\r\n  theological pamphlets, first published by Paul de Faget in 1668). This\r\n  contained four treatises on the Eucharist, the sacrifice of the Mass,\r\n  the erection of the patriarchate of Constantinople (in Latin), and the\r\n  sacrament of the Eucharist (in French). It was supposed to contain\r\n  heretical propositions and caused a good deal of scandal, inciting\r\n  Baluze against Faget, both of whom abused the other, to defend the\r\n  memory of the prelate.\r\n\r\n  See Bayle's article in the _Dictionnaire historique et critique_ (s.v.\r\n  \"Marca\"), and the Vie de Marca in the _Histoire de Béarn_ (vol. i.,\r\n  1894) of V. Dubarat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCANTONIO [MARCANTONIO RAIMONDI], the chief Italian master of the art\r\nof engraving in the age of the Renaissance, and the first who practised\r\nit in order to reproduce, not designs of his own invention, as earlier\r\ncraftsmen had commonly done, but those of other artists almost\r\nexclusively. The date of his birth is uncertain, nor is there any good\r\nauthority for assigning it, as is commonly done, approximately to the\r\nyear 1488. He was probably born some years at least earlier than this,\r\ninasmuch as he is mentioned by a contemporary writer, Achillini, as\r\nbeing an artist of repute in 1504. His earliest dated plate,\r\nillustrating the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, belongs to the following\r\nyear, 1505. Marcantonio received his training in the workshop of the\r\nfamous goldsmith and painter of Bologna, Francesco Raibolini, usually\r\ncalled Francia. \"Having more aptitude in design,\" says Vasari, \"than his\r\nmaster, and managing the graver with facility and grace, he made\r\nwaist-buckles and many other things in niello, such being then greatly\r\nin fashion, and made them most beautifully, as being in truth most\r\nexcellent in that craft.\" The real fame, however, of Marcantonio was\r\ndestined to be founded on his attainments, not in the goldsmith's art\r\ngenerally, but in that particular development of it which consists of\r\nengraving designs on metal plates for the purpose of reproduction by the\r\nprinting press. This art was not new in Italy in the days of\r\nMarcantonio's apprenticeship. It had been practised, in a more or less\r\nelementary form, for not less than forty or fifty years in the workshops\r\nalike of Venetia, the Emilia, Tuscany and Lombardy. But the technical\r\naim of the Italian engravers had not hitherto been directed, like that\r\nof Schongauer or Dürer north of the Alps, towards securing such freedom\r\nand precision in the use of the burin as should impart to the\r\nimpressions taken from their engraved plates both a striking decorative\r\neffect and a power of suggesting to the eye a complex variety of natural\r\nobjects and surfaces in light and shade. The Italian masters had been\r\nsatisfied with much more rudimentary effects. The Florentine primitives\r\nhad been content either with very simple cloudy patches of\r\ncross-hatching in fine straight lines, or with broad open shadings in\r\nthe manner of a bold pen-drawing. Mantegna and Pollaiuolo, the two chief\r\noriginal masters who practised the art, had used the latter method with\r\ngreat power but at the same time great simplicity.\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of the 16th century a desire for a more complicated\r\nkind of effects was already arising among the followers of the art in\r\nItaly. Both backgrounds and passages of foreground detail were often\r\nimitated, inartificially enough, from the works of the northern masters.\r\nMarcantonio himself was among the foremost in this movement. About\r\neighty engravings can be referred to the first five or six years of his\r\ncareer (1505-1511). Their subjects are very various, including many of\r\npagan mythology, and some of obscure allegory, along with those of\r\nChristian devotion. The types of figures and drapery, and the general\r\ncharacter of the compositions, bespeak for the most part the\r\ninspiration, and sometimes the direct authorship, of Francia. But the\r\ninfluence of German example is very perceptible also, particularly in\r\nthe landscape backgrounds, and in the endeavour to express form by means\r\nof light and shadow with greater freedom than had been hitherto the\r\npractice of the southern schools. In a few subjects also the figures\r\nthemselves correspond to a coarse Teutonic, instead of to the refined\r\nItalian, ideal. But so far we find Marcantonio only indirectly leaning\r\non the north for the sake of self-improvement. It must have been for the\r\nsake of commercial profit that he by-and-by produced a series of direct\r\ncounterfeits on copper from Albert Dürer's woodcuts. These facsimiles\r\nare sixty-nine in number, including seventeen of Dürer's \"Life of the\r\nVirgin,\" thirty-seven of his \"Little Passion,\" on wood, and a number of\r\nsingle pieces. According to Vasari, Dürer's indignation over those\r\ncounterfeits was the cause of his journey to Venice, where he is said to\r\nhave lodged a complaint against Marcantonio, and induced the Senate to\r\nprohibit the counterfeiting of his monogram, at any rate, upon any\r\nfuture imitations of the kind. Vasari's account must certainly be\r\nmistaken, inasmuch as Dürer's journey to Venice took place in 1506, and\r\nneither of the two series of woodcuts imitated by Marcantonio was\r\npublished until 1511. The greater part of the designs for the \"Life of\r\nthe Virgin\" had, it is true, been made and engraved seven years earlier\r\nthan the date of their publication; and it is to be remarked that,\r\nwhereas Marcantonio's copies of the \"Little Passion\" leave out the\r\nmonogram of Dürer, it is inserted in his copies of the \"Life of the\r\nVirgin\"; whence it would, after all, seem possible that he had seen and\r\ncounterfeited a set of impressions of this series at the time when they\r\nwere originally executed, and before their publication. But the real\r\nnature of the transaction, if transaction there was, which took place\r\nbetween Dürer and Marcantonio we cannot now hope to recover. Enough that\r\nthe Bolognese engraver evidently profited, both in money and in\r\neducation of the hand, by his work in imitating in a finer material the\r\nenergetic characters of these northern woodcuts. He was soon to come\r\nunder a totally different influence, and to turn the experience he had\r\ngained to account in interpreting the work of a master of a quite other\r\nstamp. Up till the year 1510 Marcantonio had lived entirely at Bologna,\r\nwith the exception, it would appear, of a visit or visits to Venice. (A\r\nfew of his early engravings are from drawings of the school of\r\nGiorgione.) Very soon afterwards he was attracted, for good and all,\r\ninto the circle which surrounded Raphael at Rome. Where or when he had\r\nfirst made Raphael's acquaintance is uncertain. His passage to Rome by\r\nway of Florence has been supposed to be marked by an engraving, dated\r\n1510, and known as \"The Climbers,\" _Les Grimpeurs_ (Bartsch, 487), in\r\nwhich he has reproduced a portion of the design of Michelangelo's\r\ncartoon of the Soldiers surprised bathing, and has added behind the\r\nfigures a landscape imitated from the then young Dutch engraver Lucas of\r\nLeiden. Contemporary or somewhat earlier than this is a large engraving\r\ndone by him from a design by Baldassare Peruzzi, a Sienese artist drawn\r\nabout the same time into the Raphael circle. The piece in which he is\r\nrecorded to have first tried his hand after Raphael himself is the\r\nLucretia (Bartsch 192). From that time until he disappears in the\r\ncatastrophe of 1527, Marcantonio was almost exclusively engaged in\r\nreproducing by means of engraving the designs of Raphael or of his\r\nimmediate pupils. Raphael, the story goes, was so delighted with the\r\nprint of the Lucretia that he personally trained and helped Marcantonio\r\nafterwards. A printing establishment was set up under the charge of\r\nRaphael's colour-grinder, Il Baviera, and the profits, in the early\r\nstage of the business, were shared between the engraver and the printer.\r\nThe sale soon became very great; pupils gathered round about\r\nMarcantonio, of whom the two most distinguished were Marco Dente, known\r\nas Marco da Ravenna, and Agostino de' Musi, known as Agostino Veneziano;\r\nand he and they, during the last ten years of Raphael's life, and for\r\nseveral years following his death, gave forth a great profusion of\r\nengravings after the master's work--not copying, in most instances, his\r\nfinished paintings, but working up, with the addition of simple\r\nbackgrounds and accessories, his first sketches and trials, which often\r\ngive the composition in a different form from the finished work, and are\r\nall the more interesting on that account.\r\n\r\nThe best of these engravings produced in the workshop of\r\nMarcantonio--those, namely, done by his own hand, and especially those\r\ndone during the first few years after he had attached himself to\r\nRaphael--count among the most prized and coveted examples of the art. In\r\nthem he enters into the genius of his master, and loses little of the\r\nchastened science and rhythmical purity of Raphael's contours, or of the\r\ninspired and winning sentiment of his faces; while in the parts where he\r\nis left to himself--the rounding and shading, the background and\r\nlandscape--he manages his burin with all the skill and freedom which he\r\nhad gained by the imitation of northern models, but puts away the\r\nnorthern emphasis and redundance of detail. His work, however, does not\r\nlong remain at the height marked by pieces like the Lucretia, the Dido,\r\nthe Judgment of Paris, the Poetry, the Philosophy, or the first Massacre\r\nof the Innocents. Marcantonio's engravings after the works of Raphael's\r\nlater years are cold, ostentatious, and soulless by comparison. Still\r\nmore so, as is natural, were those which he and his pupils produced\r\nafter the designs of the degenerate scholars of Raphael and\r\nMichelangelo, of a Giulio Romano, a Polidoro, or a Bandinelli.\r\nMarcantonio's association with Giulio Romano was the cause of his first\r\ngreat disaster in life. He engraved a series of obscene designs by that\r\npainter in illustration of the _Sonnetti lussuriosi_ of Pietro Aretino,\r\nand thereby incurred the anger of pope Clement VII., at whose order he\r\nwas thrown into prison. Marcantonio's ruin was completed by the\r\ncalamities attendant on the sack of Rome in 1527. He had to pay a heavy\r\nransom in order to escape from the hands of the Spaniards, and fled from\r\nRome, in the words of Vasari, \"all but a beggar.\" It is said that he\r\ntook refuge in his native city, Bologna; but he never again emerges from\r\nobscurity, and all we know with certainty is that in 1534 he was dead.\r\n     (S. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCASITE, a mineral with the same chemical composition as pyrites,\r\nbeing iron disulphide FeS2, but crystallizing in the orthorhombic\r\ninstead of in the cubic system. The name is of Arabic origin and was\r\nlong applied to crystallized pyrites (q.v.); it was restricted to the\r\npresent species by W. Haidinger in 1845. The mineral was known to G.\r\nAgricola in 1546 under the names _Wasserkies_ or _Weisserkies_ and\r\n_Leberkies_, and it has been variously known as white pyrites, hepatic\r\npyrites, lamellar pyrites, radiated pyrites (German _Strahlkies_) and\r\nprismatic pyrites. The orthorhombic form of the crystals, as distinct\r\nfrom the cubic form of pyrites, was recognized by Romé de l'Isle in\r\n1772, though later R. J. Haüy considered the crystals to be only\r\ndistorted cubic forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe crystals are isomorphous with mispickel (q.v.), but only rarely are\r\nthey distinctly developed and simple (fig.). Usually they are twinned on\r\na prism plane, M, producing pentagonal stellate groups of five crystals;\r\ntwinning on the plain g, in which the crystals intercross at angles of\r\nnearly 60°, is less common. This frequent twinning gives rise to\r\ncharacteristic forms, with many re-entrant angles, to which the names\r\n\"spear pyrites\" and \"cockscomb pyrites\" are applied. The commonest state\r\nof aggregation is that of radially arranged fibres, the external surface\r\nof the mass being globular, nodular or stalactitic in form.\r\n\r\nApart from crystalline form, the external characters of marcasite are\r\nvery similar to those of pyrites, and when distinct crystals are not\r\navailable the two species cannot always be easily distinguished. The\r\ncolour is usually pale bronze-yellow, often rather lighter than that of\r\npyrites; on freshly fractured surfaces of pure marcasite the colour is\r\ntin-white, but this rapidly tarnishes on exposure to air. The lustre is\r\nmetallic and brilliant. The streak is greyish or brownish-black. The\r\nhardness (6-6½) is the same as that of pyrites, and the specific gravity\r\n(4.8-4.9) as a rule rather less. Arsenical varieties of marcasite,\r\ncontaining up to 5% of arsenic, are known as lonchidite and kyrosite.\r\n\r\n  Marcasite readily oxidizes on exposure to moist air, with the\r\n  production of sulphuric acid and a white fibrous efflorescence of\r\n  ferrous sulphate, and in course of time specimens in collections often\r\n  became completely disintegrated. In nature it is frequently altered to\r\n  limonite with the separation of native sulphur. Marcasite is thus the\r\n  less stable of the two modifications of iron disulphide. Many\r\n  experiments have been made with a view to determining the difference\r\n  in chemical constitution of marcasite and pyrites, but with no very\r\n  definite results. It is a noteworthy fact that whilst pyrites has been\r\n  prepared artificially, marcasite has not.\r\n\r\n  Marcasite occurs under the same conditions as pyrites, but is much\r\n  less common. Whilst pyrites is found abundantly in the older\r\n  crystalline rocks and slates, marcasite is more abundant in clays, and\r\n  has often been formed as a concretion around organic remains. It is\r\n  abundant, for example, in the plastic clay of the Brown Coal formation\r\n  at Littmitz, near Carlsbad, in Bohemia, at which place it has been\r\n  extensively mined for the manufacture of sulphur and ferrous sulphate.\r\n  In the Chalk of the south-east of England nodules of marcasite with a\r\n  fibrous radiated structure are abundant, and in the Chalk Marl between\r\n  Dover and Folkestone fine twinned groups of \"spear pyrites\" are\r\n  common. The mineral is also met with in metalliferous veins, though\r\n  much less frequently than pyrites; for example the \"cockscomb pyrites\"\r\n  of the lead mines of Derbyshire and Cumberland.     (L. J. S.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCEAU-DESGRAVIERS, FRANÇOIS SÉVERIN (1769-1796), French general, was\r\nborn at Chartres on the 1st of March 1769. His father was a law officer,\r\nand he was educated for a legal career, but at the age of sixteen he\r\nenlisted in the regiment of Savoy-Carignan. Whilst on furlough in Paris\r\nMarceau joined in the attack on the Bastille (July 14, 1789); after that\r\nevent he took his discharge from the regular army and returned to\r\nChartres, but the embarrassments of his family soon compelled him to\r\nseek fresh military employment. He became drill instructor, and\r\nafterwards captain in the departmental (Eure-et-Loire) regiment of the\r\nNational Guard. Early in March 1792 he was elected lieutenant-colonel\r\nof one of the battalions of the Eure-et-Loire; he took part in the\r\ndefence of Verdun in 1792, and it fell to his lot to bear the proposals\r\nof capitulation to the Prussian camp. The spiritless conduct of the\r\ndefenders excited the wrath of the revolutionary authorities, and\r\nMarceau was fortunate in escaping arrest and finding re-employment as a\r\ncaptain in the regular service. Early in 1793 he became with other\r\nofficers \"suspect,\" and was for some time imprisoned. On his release he\r\nhurried to take part in the defence of Saumur against the Vendéan\r\nroyalists, and distinguished himself at the combat of Saumur (June 10,\r\n1793) by gallantly rescuing the representative Bourbotte from the hands\r\nof the insurgents. The Convention voted him the thanks of the country,\r\nand thenceforward his rise was rapid. His conduct at Chantonnay (Sept.\r\n5) won him the provisional rank of general of brigade. On the 17th of\r\nOctober he bore a great part in the victory of Cholet, and on the field\r\nof this battle began his friendship with Kléber. For the victory of\r\nCholet Kléber was made general of division and Marceau confirmed as\r\ngeneral of brigade. Their advice was of the greatest value to the\r\ngenerals in command, and the military talents of each were the\r\ncomplement of the other's. Marceau, who became general of division (Nov.\r\n10), succeeded to the chief command _ad interim_, and with his friend\r\nwon important victories near Le Mans (Dec 12-13) and Savenay (Dec. 23).\r\nAfter the battle of Le Mans, Marceau rescued and protected a young\r\nRoyalist lady, Angélique des Mesliers. It is often supposed that he was\r\nin love with his prisoner; but the help even of the commander-in-chief\r\ndid not avail to save her from the guillotine (Jan. 22, 1794). Marceau\r\nhad already retired from the war, exhausted by the fatigues of the\r\ncampaign, and he and Kléber were saved from arrest and execution only by\r\nthe intervention of Bourbotte. Marceau became affianced about this time\r\nto Agathe Leprêtre de Châteaugiron, but his constant military\r\nemployment, his broken health, and the opposition of the comte de\r\nChâteaugiron on the one hand and of Marceau's devoted half-sister\r\n\"Emira,\" wife of the Republican politician Sergent, on the other,\r\nprevented the realization of his hopes. After spending the winter of\r\n1793-1794 in Paris he took a command in the army under Jourdan, in which\r\nKléber also served. He took part in the various battles about Charleroi,\r\nand at the final victory of Fleurus (June 26, 1794) he had a horse shot\r\nunder him. He distinguished himself again at Jülich and at Aldenhoven,\r\nand stormed the fines of Coblenz on the 23rd of October. With the Army\r\nof the Sambre and Meuse he took his share in the campaign of 1795 on the\r\nRhine and the Lahn, distinguishing himself particularly with Kléber in\r\nthe fighting about Neuwied on the 18th and 19th of October, and at\r\nSulzbach on the 17th of December. In the campaign of 1796 the famous\r\ninvasion of Germany by the armies of Jourdan and Moreau ended in\r\ndisaster, and Marceau's men covered Jourdan's retreat over the Rhine. He\r\nfought the desperate actions on the Lahn (Sept. 16 and 18), and at\r\nAltenkirchen on the 19th received a mortal wound, of which he died on\r\nthe 21st, at the early age of twenty-seven. The Austrians vied with his\r\nown countrymen in doing honour to the dead general. His body was burned,\r\nand his ashes, which at the time were placed under a pyramid designed by\r\nKléber, were transferred in 1889 to the Pantheon at Paris.\r\n\r\n  See Maze, _Le Général Marceau_ (1889); Parfait, _Le Général Marceau_\r\n  (1892); and T. C. Johnson, _Marceau_ (London, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCEL, ÉTIENNE (d. 1358), provost of the merchants of Paris under King\r\nJohn II., belonged by birth to the wealthy Parisian _bourgeoisie_, being\r\nthe son of a clothier named Simon Marcel and of Isabelle Barbou. He is\r\nmentioned as provost of the Grande-Confrérie of Notre Dame in 1350, and\r\nin 1354 he succeeded Jean de Pacy as provost of the Parisian merchants.\r\nHis political career began in 1356, when John was made prisoner after\r\nthe battle of Poitiers. In conjunction with Robert le Coq, bishop of\r\nLaon, he played a leading part in the states-general called together by\r\nthe dauphin Charles on the 17th of October. A committee of eighty\r\nmembers, constituted on their initiative, pressed their demands with\r\nsuch insistence that the dauphin prorogued the states-general; but\r\nfinancial straits obliged him to summon them once more on the 3rd of\r\nFebruary 1357, and the promulgation of a great edict of reform was the\r\nconsequence. John the Good forbade its being put into effect, whereupon\r\na conflict began between Marcel and the dauphin, Marcel endeavouring to\r\nset up Charles the Bad, king of Navarre, in opposition to him. The\r\nstates-general assembled again on the 13th of January 1358, and on the\r\n22nd of February the populace of Paris, led by Marcel, invaded the\r\npalace and murdered the marshals of Champagne and Normandy before the\r\nprince's eyes. Thenceforward Marcel was in open hostility to the throne.\r\nAfter vainly hoping that the insurrection of the Jacquerie might turn to\r\nhis advantage, he next supported the king of Navarre, whose armed bands\r\ninfested the neighbourhood of Paris. On the night of the 31st of July\r\nMarcel was about to open the gates of the capital to them, but Jean\r\nMaillart prevented the execution of this design, and killed him before\r\nthe Porte Saint-Antoine. During the following days his adherents were\r\nlikewise put to death, and the dauphin was enabled to re-enter Paris.\r\nÉtienne Marcel married first Jeanne de Dammartin, and secondly\r\nMarguerite des Essars, who survived him.\r\n\r\n  See F. T. Perrens, _Étienne Marcel et le gouvernement de la\r\n  bourgeoisie au xiv^e siècle_ (Paris, 1860); P. Frémaux, _La Famille\r\n  d'Étienne Marcel_, in the _Mémoires_ of the _Société de l'histoire de\r\n  Paris et de l'Île de France_ (1903), vol. xxx.; and Hon. R. D. Denman,\r\n  _Étienne Marcel_ (1898).     (J. V.*)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCELLINUS, ST, according to the Liberian catalogue, became bishop of\r\nRome on the 30th of June, 296; his predecessor was Caius or Gaius. He is\r\nnot mentioned in the _Martyrologium hieronymianum_, or in the _Depositio\r\nepiscoporum_, or in the _Depositio martyrum_. The _Liber pontificalis_,\r\nbasing itself on the Acts of St Marcellinus, the text of which is lost,\r\nrelates that during Diocletian's persecution Marcellinus was called upon\r\nto sacrifice, and offered incense to idols, but that, repenting shortly\r\nafterwards, he confessed the faith of Christ and suffered martyrdom with\r\nseveral companions. Other documents speak of his defection, and it is\r\nprobably this lapse that explains the silence of the ancient liturgical\r\ncalendars. In the beginning of the 5th century Petilianus, the Donatist\r\nbishop of Constantine, affirmed that Marcellinus and his priests had\r\ngiven up the holy books to the pagans during the persecution and offered\r\nincense to false gods. St Augustine contents himself with denying the\r\naffair (_Contra litt. Petiliani_, ii. 202; _De unico baptismo_, 27). The\r\nrecords of the pseudo-council of Sinuessa, which were fabricated at the\r\nbeginning of the 6th century, state that Marcellinus after his fall\r\npresented himself before a council, which refused to try him on the\r\nground that _prima sedes a nemine iudicatur_. According to the _Liber\r\npontificalis_, Marcellinus was buried, on the 26th of April 304, in the\r\ncemetery of Priscilla, on the Via Salaria, 25 days after his martyrdom;\r\nthe Liberian catalogue gives as the date the 25th of October. The fact\r\nof the martyrdom, too, is not established with certainty. After a\r\nconsiderable interregnum he was succeeded by Marcellus, with whom he has\r\nsometimes been confounded.\r\n\r\n  See L. Duchesne, _Liber pontificalis_, I. lxxiii.-lxxiv. 162-163, and\r\n  II. 563.     (H. De.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCELLO, BENEDETTO (1686-1739), Italian musical composer, was born in\r\n1686, either on the 31st of July or on the 1st of August. He was of\r\nnoble family (in his compositions he is frequently described as\r\n\"Patrizio Veneto\"), and although a pupil of Lotti and Gasparini, was\r\nintended by his father to devote himself to the law. In 1711 he was a\r\nmember of the Council of Forty, and in 1730 went to Pola as\r\nProvveditore. His health having been impaired by the climate of Istria,\r\nhe retired after eight years to Brescia in the capacity of Camerlengo,\r\nand died there on the 24th of July 1739.\r\n\r\nMarcello is best remembered by his _Estro poetico-armonico_ (Venice,\r\n1724-1727), a musical setting for voices and strings of the first fifty\r\nPsalms, as paraphrased in Italian by G. Giustiniani. They were much\r\nadmired by Charles Avison, who with John Garth brought out an edition\r\nwith English words (London, 1757). Some extracts are to be found in\r\nHawkins's _History of Music_. His other works are chiefly cantatas,\r\neither for one voice or several; the library of the Brussels\r\nconservatoire possesses some interesting volumes of chamber-cantatas\r\ncomposed for his mistress. Although he produced an opera, _La Fede\r\nriconosciuta_, at Vicenza in 1702, he had little sympathy with this form\r\nof composition, and vented his opinions on the state of musical drama at\r\nthe time in the satirical pamphlet _Il Teatro alla moda_, published\r\nanonymously in Venice in 1720. This little work, which was frequently\r\nreprinted, is not only extremely amusing, but is also most valuable as a\r\ncontribution to the history of opera.\r\n\r\n  A catalogue of his works is given in _Monatshefte für\r\n  Musikgeschichte_, vol. xxiii. (1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS, the name of two popes.\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS I. succeeded Marcellinus, after a considerable interval, most\r\nprobably in May 308, under Maxentius. He was banished from Rome in 309\r\non account of the tumult caused by the severity of the penances he had\r\nimposed on Christians who had lapsed under the recent persecution. He\r\ndied the same year, being succeeded by Eusebius. He is commemorated on\r\nthe 16th of January.\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS II. (Marcello Cervini), the successor of Julius III., was born\r\non the 6th of May 1501, and was elected pope on the 9th of April 1555.\r\nHe had long been identified with the rigorist party in the church, and\r\nas president of the Council of Trent had incurred the anger of the\r\nemperor by his jealous defence of papal prerogative. His motives were\r\nlofty, his life blameless, his plans for reform nobly conceived. But\r\ndeath removed him (April 30, 1555) before he could do more than give an\r\nearnest of his intentions. He was followed by Paul IV.\r\n\r\n  Contemporary lives are to be found in Panvinio, continuator of\r\n  Platina, _De vitis pontiff, rom._; and Ciaconius, _Vitae et res gestae\r\n  summorum pontiff. rom._ (Rome, 1601-1602). P. Polidoro, _De gestis,\r\n  vita et moribus Marcelli II._ (Rome, 1744), makes use of an\r\n  unpublished biography of the pope by his brother, Alessandro Cervini.\r\n  See also Brilli, _Intorno alla vita e alle azioni di Marcello II._\r\n  (Montepulciano, 1846); Ranke, _Popes_ (Eng. trans., Austin), i. 284\r\n  seq.; A. von Reumont, _Gesch. der Stadt Rom_, iii. 2, 512, seq.\r\n       (T. F. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCELLUS, a Roman plebeian family belonging to the Claudian gens. Its\r\nmost distinguished members were the following:--\r\n\r\n1. MARCUS CLAUDIUS MARCELLUS (c. 268-208 B.C.), one of the Roman\r\ngenerals during the Second Punic War and conqueror of Syracuse. He first\r\nserved against Hamilcar in Sicily. In his first consulship (222) he was\r\nengaged, with Cn. Cornelius Scipio as colleague, in war against the\r\nInsubrian Gauls, and won the _spolia opima_ for the third and last time\r\nin Roman history by slaying their chief Viridomarus or Virdumarus\r\n(Polybius ii. 34; Propertius v. 10, 39). In 216, after the defeat at\r\nCannae, he took command of the remnant of the army at Canusium, and\r\nalthough he was unable to prevent Capua going over to Hannibal, he saved\r\nNola and southern Campania. In 214 he was in Sicily as consul at the\r\ntime of the revolt of Syracuse; he stormed Leontini and besieged\r\nSyracuse, but the skill of Archimedes repelled his attacks. After a two\r\nyears' siege he gradually forced his way into the city and took it in\r\nthe face of strong Punic reinforcements. He spared the lives of the\r\ninhabitants, but carried off their art treasures to Rome, the first\r\ninstance of a practice afterwards common. Consul again in 210, he took\r\nSalapia in Apulia, which had revolted to Hannibal, by help of the Roman\r\nparty there, and put to death the Numidian garrison. Proconsul in 209,\r\nhe attacked Hannibal near Venusia, and after a desperate battle retired\r\nto that town; he was accused of bad generalship, and had to leave the\r\narmy to defend himself in Rome. In his last consulship (208), he and his\r\ncolleague, while reconnoitring near Venusia, were unexpectedly attacked,\r\nand Marcellus was killed. His successes have been exaggerated by Livy,\r\nbut the name often given to him, the \"sword of Rome,\" was well deserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Livy xxiii. 14-17, 41-46; xxiv. 27-32, 35-39; xxv. 5-7, 23-31; xxvi.\r\n  26, 29-32; xxvii. 1-5, 21-28; Polybius viii. 5-9, x. 32; Appian,\r\n  _Hannib._ 50; Florus ii. 6.\r\n\r\n2. M. CLAUDIUS MARCELLUS, an inveterate opponent of Julius Caesar.\r\nDuring his consulship (51 B.C.) he proposed to remove Caesar from his\r\narmy in March 49, but this decision was delayed by Pompey's irresolution\r\nand the skilful opposition of the tribune C. Curio (see CAESAR, JULIUS).\r\nIn January 49 he tried to put off declaring war against Caesar till an\r\narmy could be got ready, but his advice was not taken. When Pompey left\r\nItaly, Marcus and his brother Gaius followed, while his cousin withdrew\r\nto Liternum. After Pharsalus M. Marcellus retired to Mytilene, where he\r\npractised rhetoric and studied philosophy. In 46 his cousin and the\r\nsenate successfully appealed to Caesar to pardon him, and Marcellus\r\nreluctantly consented to return. On this occasion Cicero's[1] speech\r\n_Pro Marcello_ was delivered. Marcellus left for Italy, but was murdered\r\nin May by one of his own attendants, P. Magius Chilo, in the Peiraeus.\r\nMarcellus was a thorough aristocrat. He was an eloquent speaker (Cicero,\r\n_Brutus_, 71), and a man of firm character, although not free from\r\navarice.\r\n\r\n  See Cicero, _Ad fam._ iv. 4, 7, 10, and _Ad Att._ v. 11 (ed. Tyrrell\r\n  and Purser); Caesar, _B. C._ i. 2; Suetonius, _Caesar_, 29; G.\r\n  Boissier, _Cicero and his Friends_ (Eng. trans., 1897).\r\n\r\n3. M. CLAUDIUS MARCELLUS (c. 43-23 B.C.), son of C. Marcellus and\r\nOctavia, sister of Augustus. In 25 he was adopted by the emperor and\r\nmarried to his daughter Julia. This seemed to mark him out as the heir\r\nto the throne, but Augustus, when attacked by a serious illness, gave\r\nhis signet to M. Vipsanius Agrippa. In 23 Marcellus, then curule aedile,\r\ndied at Baiae. Livia was suspected of having poisoned him to get the\r\nempire for her son Tiberius. Great hopes had been built on the youth,\r\nand he was celebrated by many writers, especially by Virgil in a famous\r\npassage (_Aeneid_, vi. 860). He was buried in the Campus Martius, and\r\nAugustus himself pronounced the funeral oration.

The earls of March on the Welsh borders were descended from\r\nRoger de Mortemer (so called from his castle of Mortemer in Normandy),\r\nwho was connected by marriage with the dukes of Normandy. His son Ralph\r\n(d. c. 1104) figures in Domesday as the holder of vast estates in\r\nShropshire, Herefordshire and other parts of England, especially in the\r\nwest; and his grandson Hugh de Mortimer, founder of the priory of\r\nWigmore in Herefordshire, was one of the most powerful of the barons\r\nreduced to submission by Henry II., who compelled him to surrender his\r\ncastles of Cleobury and Wigmore. The Mortimers, however, continued to\r\nexercise almost undisputed sway, as lords of Wigmore, over the western\r\ncounties and the Welsh marches.\r\n\r\nI. _Welsh Marches._--ROGER DE MORTIMER (c. 1286-1330), 8th baron of\r\nWigmore and 1st earl of March, being an infant at the death of his\r\nfather, Edmund, was placed by Edward I. under the guardianship of Piers\r\nGaveston, and was knighted by Edward in 1306; Mortimer's mother being a\r\nrelative of Edward's consort, Eleanor of Castile. Through his marriage\r\nwith Joan de Joinville, or Genevill, Roger not only acquired increased\r\npossessions on the Welsh marches, including the important castle of\r\nLudlow, which became the chief stronghold of the Mortimers, but also\r\nextensive estates and influence in Ireland, whither he went in 1308 to\r\nenforce his authority. This brought him into conflict with the De Lacys,\r\nwho turned for support to Edward Bruce, brother of Robert Bruce, king of\r\nScotland. Mortimer was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland by Edward\r\nII. in 1316, and at the head of a large army drove Bruce to\r\nCarrickfergus, and the De Lacys into Connaught, wreaking vengeance on\r\ntheir adherents whenever they were to be found. He was then occupied for\r\nsome years with baronial disputes on the Welsh border until about 1318,\r\nwhen he began to interest himself in the growing opposition to Edward\r\nII. and his favourites, the Despensers; and he supported Humphrey de\r\nBohun, earl of Hereford, in refusing to obey the king's summons to\r\nappear before him in 1321. Forced to surrender to the king at Shrewsbury\r\nin January 1322, Mortimer was consigned to the Tower of London, whence\r\nhe escaped to France in August 1324. In the following year Isabella,\r\nwife of Edward II., anxious to escape from her husband, obtained his\r\nconsent to her going to France to use her influence with her brother,\r\nCharles IV., in favour of peace. At the French court the queen found\r\nRoger Mortimer; she became his mistress soon afterwards, and at his\r\ninstigation refused to return to England so long as the Despensers\r\nretained power as the king's favourites. The scandal of Isabella's\r\nrelations with Mortimer compelled them both to withdraw from the French\r\ncourt to Flanders, where they obtained assistance for an invasion of\r\nEngland. Landing in England in September 1326, they were joined by\r\nHenry, earl of Lancaster; London rose in support of the queen; and\r\nEdward took flight to the west, whither he was pursued by Mortimer and\r\nIsabella. After wandering helplessly for some weeks in Wales, the king\r\nwas taken on the 16th of November, and was compelled to abdicate in\r\nfavour of his son. But though the latter was crowned as Edward III. in\r\nJanuary 1327, the country was ruled by Mortimer and Isabella, who\r\nprocured the murder of Edward II. in the following September. Rich\r\nestates and offices of profit and power were now heaped on Mortimer, and\r\nin September 1328 he was created earl of March. Greedy and grasping, he\r\nwas no more competent than the Despensers to conduct the government of\r\nthe country. The jealousy and anger of Lancaster having been excited by\r\nMarch's arrogance, Lancaster prevailed upon the young king, Edward III.,\r\nto throw off the yoke of his mother's paramour. At a parliament held at\r\nNottingham in October 1330 a plot was successfully carried out by which\r\nMarch was arrested in the castle, and, in spite of Isabella's entreaty\r\nto her son to \"have pity on the gentle Mortimer,\" was conveyed to the\r\nTower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high\r\nmisdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on\r\nthe 29th of November 1330, his vast estates being forfeited to the\r\ncrown. March's wife, by whom he had four sons and eleven daughters,\r\nsurvived till 1356. The daughters all married into powerful families,\r\nchiefly of Marcher houses. His eldest son, Edmund, was father of Roger\r\nMortimer (c. 1328-1360), who was knighted by Edward III. in 1346, and\r\nrestored to his grandfather's title as 2nd earl of March.\r\n\r\nEDMUND DE MORTIMER (1351-1381), 3rd earl of March, was son of Roger, 2nd\r\nearl of March, by his wife Philippa, daughter of William Montacute, 1st\r\nearl of Salisbury. Being an infant at the death of his father, Edmund,\r\nas a ward of the crown, was placed by Edward III. under the care of\r\nWilliam of Wykeham and Richard Fitzalan, earl of Arundel. The position\r\nof the young earl, powerful on account of his possessions and hereditary\r\ninfluence in the Welsh marches, was rendered still more important by his\r\nmarriage in 1368 to Philippa, only daughter of Lionel, duke of Clarence,\r\nthird son of Edward III. Lionel's wife was Elizabeth, daughter and\r\nheiress of William de Burgh, 6th Lord of Connaught and 3rd earl of\r\nUlster, and Lionel had himself been created earl of Ulster before his\r\nmarriage. The earl of March, therefore, not only became the\r\nrepresentative of one of the chief Anglo-Norman lordships in Ireland in\r\nright of his wife Philippa, but the latter, on the death of her father\r\nshortly after her marriage, stood next in succession to the crown after\r\nthe Black Prince and his sickly son Richard, afterwards king Richard II.\r\nThis marriage had, therefore, far-reaching consequences in the history\r\nof England, giving rise to the claim of the house of York to the crown\r\nof England, contested in the War of the Roses; Edward IV. being\r\ndescended from the third son of Edward III. as great-great-grandson of\r\nPhilippa, countess of March, and in the male line from Edmund, duke of\r\nYork, fifth son of Edward III.\r\n\r\nMortimer, now styled earl of March and Ulster, became marshal of England\r\nin 1369, and was employed in various diplomatic missions during the next\r\nfollowing years. He was a member of the committee appointed by the Peers\r\nto confer with the Commons in 1373--the first instance of such a joint\r\nconference since the institution of representative parliaments--on the\r\nquestion of granting supplies for John of Gaunt's war in France; and in\r\nthe opposition to Edward III. and the court party, which grew in\r\nstrength towards the end of the reign, March took the popular side,\r\nbeing prominent in the Good Parliament of 1376 among the lords who,\r\nencouraged by the Prince of Wales, concerted an attack upon the court\r\nparty led by John of Gaunt. The Speaker of the Commons in this\r\nparliament was March's steward, Peter de la Mare; he firmly withstood\r\nJohn of Gaunt in stating the grievances of the Commons, in supporting\r\nthe impeachment of several high court officials, and in procuring the\r\nbanishment of the king's mistress, Alice Perrers. March was a member of\r\nthe administrative council appointed by the same parliament after the\r\ndeath of the Black Prince to attend the king and advise him in all\r\npublic affairs. On the accession of Richard II., a minor, in 1377, the\r\nearl became a member of the standing council of government; though as\r\nfather of the heir-presumptive to the crown he wisely abstained from\r\nclaiming any actually administrative office. The most powerful person in\r\nthe realm was, however, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, whose jealousy\r\nof March led to the acceptance by the latter of the lieutenancy of\r\nIreland in 1379. March succeeded in asserting his authority in eastern\r\nUlster, but failed to subdue the O'Neills farther west. Proceeding to\r\nMunster to put down the turbulency of the chieftains of the south, March\r\ndied at Cork on the 27th of December 1381. He was buried in Wigmore\r\nAbbey, of which he had been a benefactor, and where his wife Philippa\r\nwho died about the same time was also interred. The earl had two sons\r\nand two daughters, the elder of whom, Elizabeth, married Henry Percy\r\n(Hotspur), son of the earl of Northumberland. His eldest son Roger\r\nsucceeded him as 4th earl of March and Ulster. His second son Edmund\r\n(1376-1409) played an important part in conjunction with his\r\nbrother-in-law Hotspur against Owen Glendower; but afterwards joined the\r\nlatter, whose daughter he married about 1402.\r\n\r\nROGER DE MORTIMER, 4th earl of March and Ulster (1374-1398), son of the\r\n3rd earl, succeeded to the titles and estates of his family when a child\r\nof seven, and a month afterwards he was appointed lord-lieutenant of\r\nIreland, his uncle Sir Thomas Mortimer acting as his deputy. Being a\r\nward of the Crown, his guardian was the earl of Kent, half-brother to\r\nRichard II.; and in 1388 he married Kent's daughter, Eleanor. The\r\nimportance which he owed to his hereditary influence and possessions,\r\nand especially to his descent from Edward III., was immensely increased\r\nwhen Richard II. publicly acknowledged him as heir-presumptive to the\r\ncrown in 1385. In 1394 he accompanied Richard to Ireland, but\r\nnotwithstanding a commission from the king as lieutenant of the\r\ndistricts over which he exercised nominal authority by hereditary right,\r\nhe made little headway against the native Irish chieftains. March\r\nenjoyed great popularity in England though he took no active part in\r\nopposing the despotic measures of the king; in Ireland he illegally\r\nassumed the native Irish costume. In August 1398 he was killed in fight\r\nwith an Irish clan, and was buried in Wigmore Abbey. March's daughter\r\nAnne married Richard earl of Cambridge, son of Edmund duke of York,\r\nfifth son of Edward III.; their son Richard, duke of York, was father of\r\nKing Edward IV., who thus derived his title to the crown and acquired\r\nthe estates of the house of Mortimer.\r\n\r\nEDMUND DE MORTIMER (1391-1425), 5th earl of March and Ulster, son of the\r\n4th earl, succeeded to his father's claim to the crown as well as to his\r\ntitle and estates on the death of the latter in Ireland in 1398. In the\r\nfollowing year Richard II. was deposed and the crown seized by Henry of\r\nLancaster. The young earl of March and his brother Roger were then kept\r\nin custody by Henry IV., who, however, treated them honourably, until\r\nMarch 1405, when they were carried off from Windsor Castle by the\r\nopponents of the Lancastrian dynasty, of whom their uncle Sir Edmund\r\nMortimer (see above) and his brother-in-law Henry Percy (Hotspur) were\r\nleaders in league with Owen Glendower. The boys were recaptured, and in\r\n1409 were committed to the care of the prince of Wales. On the accession\r\nof the latter as Henry V., in 1413, the earl of March was set at liberty\r\nand restored to his estates, his brother Roger having died some years\r\npreviously; and he continued to enjoy the favour of the king in spite of\r\na conspiracy in 1415 to place him on the throne, in which his\r\nbrother-in-law, the earl of Cambridge, played the leading part. March\r\naccompanied Henry V. throughout his wars in France, and on the king's\r\ndeath in 1422 became a member of the council of regency. He died in\r\nIreland in 1425, and as he left no issue the earldom of March in the\r\nhouse of Mortimer became extinct, the estates passing to the last earl's\r\nnephew Richard, who in 1435 was officially styled duke of York, earl of\r\nMarch and Ulster, and baron of Wigmore. Richard's son Edward having\r\nascended the throne in 1461 as Edward IV., the earldom of March became\r\nmerged in the crown.\r\n\r\n  See Thomas Rymer, _Foedera_, &c. (London, 1704-1732); T. F.

Two\r\ngenerations of Cospatricks followed in lineal succession, bearing the\r\ntitle of earl, but without territorial designation. Cospatrick II.\r\nwitnessed the charter of Alexander I. founding the abbey of Scone in\r\n1115. The 3rd earl, also named Cospatrick, a liberal benefactor of\r\nMelrose Abbey, died in 1166, leaving two sons, the younger of whom was\r\nthe ancestor of the earls of Home. The elder son, Waltheof, was the\r\nfirst of the family to be styled \"Comes de Dunbar,\" about the year 1174.\r\nHis importance is proved by the fact that he was one of the hostages for\r\nthe performance of the Treaty of Falaise for the liberation of William\r\nthe Lion in 1175. Waltheof's son Patrick Dunbar (the name Dunbar,\r\nderived from the family estates, now becoming an hereditary surname),\r\nstyled 5th earl of Dunbar, although his father had been the first to\r\nadopt the territorial designation, was keeper of Berwick Castle, and\r\nmarried Ada, natural daughter of William the Lion. His grandson Patrick,\r\n7th earl, headed the party that liberated King Alexander III. in 1255\r\nfrom the Comyns, and in the same year was nominated guardian of the king\r\nand queen by the Treaty of Roxburgh. He signed the Treaty of Perth (July\r\n6, 1266) by which Magnus VI. of Norway ceded the Isle of Man and the\r\nHebrides to Scotland. His wife was Christian, daughter of Robert Bruce,\r\nthe competitor for the crown of Scotland.\r\n\r\nPATRICK DUNBAR, 8th earl of Dunbar and 1st earl of March, claimed the\r\ncrown of Scotland in 1291 as descendant of Ada, daughter of William the\r\nLion. He was one of the \"seven earls of Scotland,\" a distinct body\r\nseparate from the other estates of the realm, who claimed the right to\r\nelect a king in cases of disputed succession, and whose authority was,\r\nperhaps, to be traced to the seven provinces of the Pictish kingdom. He\r\nwas the first of the earls of Dunbar to appear in the records as \"comes\r\nde Marchia,\" or earl of March. Like most of his family in later times,\r\nhe was favourable to the English interest in Scottish affairs, and he\r\ndid homage to Edward I. of England. His wife Marjory, daughter of\r\nAlexander Comyn, earl of Buchan, took the other side and held the castle\r\nof Dunbar for Baliol, but was forced to surrender it to Edward in 1296.\r\nIn 1298 he was appointed the English king's lieutenant in Scotland.\r\n\r\nPATRICK DUNBAR (1285-1369), 9th earl of Dunbar and 2nd earl of March,\r\nson of the preceding, gave refuge to Edward II. of England after\r\nBannockburn, and contrived his escape by sea to England. Later, he made\r\npeace with Robert Bruce, and by him was appointed governor of Berwick\r\nCastle, which he held against Edward III. until the defeat of the Scots\r\nat Halidon Hill (July 19, 1333) made it no longer tenable. His countess,\r\nknown in Scottish history and romance as \"Black Agnes,\" daughter of\r\nThomas Randolph, earl of Moray (Murray), and grandniece of Robert Bruce,\r\nis famous for her defence of Dunbar Castle against the English under the\r\nearl of Salisbury in 1338, Salisbury being forced to abandon the attempt\r\nafter a fierce siege lasting nineteen weeks. This lady succeeded to the\r\nestates and titles of her brother, John Randolph, 3rd earl of Moray. The\r\nearldom of Moray passed after her death to her second son, John Dunbar,\r\nwho married Marjory, daughter of King Robert II. Black Agnes also bore\r\nto the earl of March two daughters, the elder of whom, Agnes, after\r\nbeing the mistress of King David II., married Sir James Douglas, lord of\r\nDalkeith, from whom were descended the first three earls of Morton; the\r\nyounger, Elizabeth, married John Maitland of Lethington, ancestor of the\r\nduke of Lauderdale, whose second title was marquess of March.\r\n\r\nGEORGE DUNBAR (d. 1420), 10th earl of Dunbar and 3rd earl of March,\r\ngreat-nephew of the 8th earl and warden of the marches, accompanied\r\nDouglas in his foray into England in 1388, and commanded the Scots after\r\nOtterburn. He afterwards quarrelled with the Douglases, because his\r\ndaughter was passed over in favour of a daughter of Archibald, \"the Grim\r\nEarl of Douglas,\" as wife for David, duke of Rothesay, son of Robert\r\nIII. When Douglas seized March's lands the latter fled to England, where\r\nhe was welcomed by Henry IV., to whom he was related. He fought on the\r\nEnglish side at Homildon Hill; and, having revealed to Henry the\r\ndefection of the Percies, who were in league with Douglas and Owen\r\nGlendower, he fought against those allies at the battle of Shrewsbury\r\n(July 23, 1403). Becoming reconciled with Douglas, he returned to\r\nScotland in 1409, and was restored to his earldom by the regent Albany.\r\nHe died in 1420.\r\n\r\nGEORGE DUNBAR, 11th earl of Dunbar and 4th earl of March, was one of the\r\nnegotiators for the release of James I. of Scotland in 1423 from his\r\ncaptivity in England, and was knighted at that king's coronation. In\r\n1434, however, on the ground that the regent had had no power to reverse\r\nhis father's forfeiture for treason, March was imprisoned and his castle\r\nof Dunbar seized by the king; and the parliament at Perth declared his\r\nlands and titles forfeited to the crown. The earl, being released,\r\nretired to England with his son Patrick, whose daughter and heiress\r\nMargaret was ancestress of Patrick, 5th earl of Dumfries, now\r\nrepresented by the marquess of Bute.\r\n\r\nThe earldom of March in the house of Dunbar having thus been forfeited\r\nto the crown, James II. in 1455 conferred the title, together with that\r\nof warden of the marches, on his second son Alexander, duke of Albany;\r\nbut this prince entered into treasonable correspondence with Edward IV.\r\nof England, and in 1487 the earldom of March and the barony and castle\r\nof Dunbar were again declared forfeited and annexed to the crown of\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThe title of earl of March was next held by the house of Lennox. In 1576\r\nthe earldom of Lennox became extinct on the death without male issue of\r\nCharles (father of Lady Arabella Stuart), 5th earl of Lennox; and it was\r\nthen revived in favour of Robert Stuart, a grand-uncle of King James\r\nVI., second son of John, 3rd earl of Lennox. But in 1579 Esmé Stuart, a\r\nmember of a collateral branch which in 1508 had inherited the lordship\r\nof Aubigny in France, came to Scotland and obtained much favour with\r\nJames VI. The earldom of Lennox (soon afterwards raised to a dukedom)\r\nwas taken from Robert and conferred upon Esmé; and Robert was\r\ncompensated by being created earl of March and baron of Dunbar (1582).\r\nRobert died without legitimate issue in 1586, when the earldom of March\r\nagain reverted to the crown. In 1619 Esmé, 3rd duke of Lennox, was\r\ncreated earl of March; and his son James was created duke of Richmond\r\nin 1641. On the death without issue of Charles, 6th duke of Lennox and\r\n3rd duke of Richmond, in 1672, his titles devolved upon King Charles II.\r\nas nearest collateral heir-male. In 1675 Charles conferred the titles of\r\nduke of Richmond and Lennox and earl of March on Charles Lennox, his\r\nnatural son by Louise de Keroualle, duchess of Portsmouth, from whom the\r\nearldom of March has descended to its present holder the duke of\r\nRichmond and Gordon. (See RICHMOND, EARLS AND DUKES OF; and LENNOX.)\r\n\r\nThe title of earl of March in the peerage of Scotland, by another\r\ncreation, was conferred in 1697 on William Douglas, second son of\r\nWilliam, 1st duke of Queensberry. His grandson William, 3rd earl of\r\nMarch, became 4th duke of Queensberry on the death without surviving\r\nmale issue of his cousin Charles, 3rd duke of Queensberry, in 1778.\r\nDying unmarried in 1810, the several titles of the duke passed to\r\ndifferent branches of the house of Douglas. The earldom of March is\r\nstated by Sir Bernard Burke and other authorities to have devolved upon\r\nFrancis, 8th earl of Wemyss, great-great-grandson of David, 3rd earl of\r\nWemyss, whose wife was Anne, daughter of the 1st duke of Queensberry and\r\nsister of the 1st earl of March; and the title is now assumed by the\r\nearl of Wemyss. On the other hand, Francis, 8th earl of Wemyss, not\r\nhaving been an heir of the body of the 1st earl of March, Sir Robert\r\nDouglas says in _The Peerage of Scotland_ that on the death of the 4th\r\nduke of Queensberry in 1810 \"the earldom of March, it is supposed,\r\nbecame extinct.\"\r\n\r\n  See Andrew Lang, _History of Scotland_ (4 vols., London, 1900-1907);\r\n  Sir Bernard Burke, _A Genealogical History of Dormant and Extinct\r\n  Peerages_ (London, 1866); Sir Robert Douglas, _The Peerage of\r\n  Scotland_ (2 vols., Edinburgh 1813); Lady Elizabeth Cust, _Some\r\n  Account of the Stuarts of Aubigny in France_ (London, 1891).\r\n       (R. J. M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH, AUZIAS (c. 1395-1458), Catalan poet, was born at Valencia towards\r\nthe end of the 14th century. Little is known of his career except that\r\nhe was twice married--first to Na Ysabel Martorell, and second to Na\r\nJohanna Scorna--that he died on the 4th of November 1458, and that he\r\nleft several natural children. Inheriting an easy fortune from his\r\nfather, the treasurer to the duke of Gandia, and enjoying the powerful\r\npatronage of Prince Carlos de Viana of Aragon, March was enabled to\r\ndevote himself to poetical composition. He is an undisguised follower of\r\nPetrarch, carrying the imitation to such a point that he addresses his\r\n_Cants d'amor_ to a lady whom he professes to have seen first in church\r\non Good Friday; so far as the difference of language allows, he\r\nreproduces the rhythmical cadences of his model, and in the _Cants de\r\nmort_ touches a note of brooding sentiment peculiar to himself. Though\r\nhis poems are disfigured by obscurity and a monotonous morbidity, he was\r\nfully entitled to the supremacy which he enjoyed among his\r\ncontemporaries, and the success of his innovation no doubt encouraged\r\nBoscán to introduce the Italian metres into Castilian.\r\n\r\n  His verses were first printed in Catalan in 1543, but they had already\r\n  become known through the Castilian translation published by Baltasar\r\n  de Romani in 1539.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH, FRANCIS ANDREW (1825-   ), American philologist and\r\neducationalist, was born on the 25th of October 1825 in Millbury,\r\nMassachusetts. He graduated in 1845 at Amherst, where his attention was\r\nturned to the study of Anglo-Saxon by Noah Webster. He was a teacher at\r\nSwanzey, New Hampshire, and at the Leicester Academy, Massachusetts, in\r\n1845-1847, and attempted the philological method of teaching English\r\n\"like Latin and Greek,\" later described in his _Method of Philological\r\nStudy of the English Language_ (1865); at Amherst in 1847-1849; at\r\nFredericksburg, Virginia, in 1852-1855; and in 1855 became a tutor at\r\nLafayette College, where he became adjunct professor of belles-lettres\r\nand English literature in 1856, and professor of English language and\r\ncomparative philology--the first chair of the kind established--in 1857.\r\nHe lectured on constitutional and public law and Roman law in 1875-1877,\r\nand also taught subjects as diverse as botany and political economy. In\r\n1907 he became professor emeritus. At Lafayette he introduced the first\r\ncarefully scientific study of English in any American college, and in\r\n1870 published _A Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Language, in\r\nwhich its Forms are Illustrated by Those of the Sanskrit, Greek, Latin,\r\nGothic, Old Saxon, Old Friesic, Old Norse and Old High German_, and _An\r\nAnglo-Saxon Reader_; he was editor of the \"Douglass Series of Christian\r\nGreek and Latin Classics,\" to which he contributed _Latin Hymns_ (1874);\r\nhe was chairman of the Commission of the State of Pennsylvania on\r\nAmended Orthography; and was consulting editor of the _Standard\r\nDictionary_, and in 1879-1882 was director of the American readers for\r\nthe Philological Society's (New Oxford) _Dictionary_. He was president\r\nof the American Philological Association in 1873-1874 and in 1895-1896,\r\nof the Spelling Reform Association after 1876, and of the Modern\r\nLanguage Association in 1891-1893. Among American linguistic scholars\r\nMarch ranks with Whitney, Child and Gildersleeve; and his studies in\r\nEnglish, though practically pioneer work in America, are of undoubted\r\nvalue. His article \"On Recent Discussions of Grimm's Law\" in the\r\n_Transactions and Proceedings_ of the American Philological Association\r\nfor 1873 in large part anticipated Verner's law. With his son, Francis\r\nAndrew March, jun. (b. 1863), adjunct-professor of modern languages in\r\n1884-1891 and subsequently professor of English literature at Lafayette,\r\nhe edited _A Thesaurus Dictionary of the English Language_ (1903).\r\n\r\n  See _Addresses in Honor of Professor Francis A.

There\r\nare agricultural implement and engineering works, and corn mills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH, the third month of the modern calendar, containing thirty-one\r\ndays. It was the Romans' first month until the adoption of the Julian\r\ncalendar, 46 B.C., and it continued to be the beginning of the legal\r\nyear in England until the 18th century. In France it was reckoned the\r\nfirst month of the year until 1564, when, by an edict of Charles IX.,\r\nJanuary was decreed to be thenceforth the first month. Scotland followed\r\nthe example of France in 1599; but in England the change did not take\r\nplace before 1752. The Romans called the month _Martius_, a name\r\nsupposed to have been conferred on it by Romulus in honour of his\r\nputative father, Mars, the god of war; but Ovid declares the month to\r\nhave existed before the time of Romulus, though in a different position\r\nin the calendar. The Anglo-Saxons called March _Hlyd-monath_, \"loud or\r\nstormy month,\" or _Lencten-monath_, \"lengthening month,\" in allusion to\r\nthe fact that the days then rapidly become longer. There is an old\r\nsaying, common to both England and Scotland--which has its equivalent\r\namong the Basques and many European peoples--representing March as\r\nborrowing three days from April; the last three days of March being\r\ncalled the \"borrowing\" or the \"borrowed days.\" As late as the end of the\r\n18th century the first three days of March were known in Devonshire as\r\n\"Blind Days,\" and were deemed so unlucky that no farmer would sow seed\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nThe chief festival days of March are the 1st, St David; the 12th, St\r\nGregory; the 17th, St Patrick; and the 25th, Lady Day, one of the\r\nquarter days in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH (1) (from Fr. _marcher_, to walk; the earliest sense in French\r\nappears to be \"to trample,\" and the origin has usually been found in the\r\nLat. _marcus_, hammer; Low Lat. _marcare_, to hammer; hence to beat the\r\nroad with the regular tread of a soldier: cf. \"beat,\" of a policeman's\r\nround), the movement of military troops with regular rhythmical steps,\r\noften with the time marked by the beat of drum, the sound of pipes or\r\nbugles or the music of a military band; hence the advance or movement of\r\na body of troops from one point to another, and the distance covered in\r\nso doing. The word is also naturally applied to the music composed for\r\nmarching to, and to the steady regular advance or progress of\r\nnon-military bodies or persons, or of events, &c. In the military sense,\r\n\"marching\" is walking in formed bodies of troops, either during drill\r\nevolutions on parade or on the \"line of march\" from one place to\r\nanother. In both senses the word is used with mounted troops as well as\r\nwith dismounted men. Formerly all evolutions were carried out at the\r\nso-called \"parade-march\" pace of about 75-80 paces to the minute, and in\r\none or two armies of the 18th century the parade step cadence was as\r\nslow as 60. These cadences are now, however, reserved in all armies for\r\nceremonial occasions, and the usual manoeuvre and marching pace (\"quick\r\nmarch\") is about 120, the \"double\" march pace (_pas gymnastique_) about\r\n180. The \"quick\" march, translated into miles and hours, is about 3½ or\r\n3(5/8) miles an hour in all armies, though a few special bodies of light\r\ntroops such as the Italian _Bersaglieri_ are trained to move at a much\r\nfaster rate for hours together, either by alternate \"quick\" and \"double\"\r\nmarching or by an unvarying \"jog-trot.\" The paces recognized for cavalry\r\nare the walk, the trot, the canter and the gallop; the usual practice on\r\nthe line of march being to alternate the walk and the trot, which\r\ncombination gives a speed of about 5 miles an hour for many hours\r\ntogether. A \"day's march,\" or more simply a \"march,\" is usually reckoned\r\nto be 15-16 miles for a large body of troops, a \"forced\" march being one\r\nof 20 miles or over, or one in which, from whatever cause, the troops\r\nare on foot for more than about seven hours. For large bodies of troops\r\nthe rate of movement on the line of march rarely exceeds 3 miles an\r\nhour. The immense assistance afforded by music to marching troops has\r\nbeen recognized from the earliest times of organized armies, and a great\r\ndeal of special march-music has been written for military bands,\r\nformerly often in ¾ or 6/8 time (one bar representing one pace with the\r\nfoot), but now almost invariably in common or 2/4 time, which is more\r\nsuitable for the \"quick march.\" The music itself is usually a\r\ncombination of simple, lively melody and well-marked accents for the\r\ndrums, with little attempt at contrapuntal writing. The fife or piccolo,\r\nthe natural bugle (in Italy and elsewhere the chromatic key-bugle is\r\nused), and the drum are the principal instruments, the \"band,\" as\r\ndistinct from the \"drums\" and \"bugles,\" having in addition to drum and\r\nfifes clarinets (saxophones in France and Belgium) and saxhorns of all\r\ntypes. In Scottish regiments, and in a few isolated cases elsewhere,\r\nbagpipes provide the marching music. The importance of music on the\r\nmarch is attested further by the almost universal practice of singing or\r\nwhistling marching songs, and even playing them on concertinas, &c., in\r\nthe absence of the band and drums.\r\n\r\n2. From _marche_, the French form of a common Teutonic word represented\r\nin English by \"mark\" (q.v.), a boundary or frontier region between two\r\ncountries or districts. The word appears to have been first used in this\r\nsense in the 8th century, and the earliest \"mark\" or \"march\" districts\r\nwere tracts of land on the borders of the Carolingian Empire. Wherever\r\nCharlemagne pushed forward the frontiers of the Frankish realm he\r\nprovided for the security of his lands, new and old alike, by\r\nestablishing mark districts on the borders. The defence and oversight of\r\nthese were entrusted to special officers, afterwards called margraves,\r\nor counts of the mark, who usually enjoyed more extensive powers than\r\nfell to the lot of an ordinary count. It is at this time that we hear\r\nfirst of the Spanish mark (_marca hispanica_) and the Bavarian mark\r\n(_marca bajoariae_). These mark districts were practically obliterated\r\nduring the reigns of the feeble sovereigns who succeeded Charlemagne,\r\nbut the system was revived with the accession of Henry the Fowler to the\r\nGerman throne early in the 10th century and with a renewal of the work\r\nof conquering and colonizing the regions east of the Elbe, and in\r\neastern Germany generally. Under Henry and his son, Otto the Great,\r\nmarks were again set upon the borders of Germany, and this time the\r\norganization was more lasting. The mark districts increased in size and\r\nstrength, especially those which fell under the dominion of an able and\r\nenergetic ruler, and some of them became powerful states, retaining the\r\nname mark long after the original significance of the word had been\r\nforgotten. It is interesting to note that the two most important of the\r\nmodern German states, Austria and Prussia, both had their origin in mark\r\ndistricts, the mark of Brandenburg, the nucleus of the kingdom of\r\nPrussia, being at first a border district to the east of the duchy of\r\nSaxony, and the east mark, or mark of Austria, being a border district\r\nof the duchy of Bavaria. In Italy march districts made their appearance\r\nabout the same time as in other parts of the Frankish Empire. The best\r\nknown of these is the march of Ancona, which with other marches and\r\nadjoining districts, was known later as the Marches, a province lying\r\nabout the centre of Italy between the Apennines and the Adriatic Sea.\r\nAfter forming part of the states of the Church the Marches were united\r\nwith the kingdom of Italy in 1860 (see MARCHES, THE).\r\n\r\nIn England in the same connexion the plural word \"marches\" was the form\r\ncommonly adopted, and soon after the Norman Conquest the disturbed\r\ndistricts on the borders of Wales began to be known as the Welsh\r\nmarches. Lands therein were granted to powerful nobles on condition that\r\nthey undertook the defence of the neighbouring counties of England.\r\nThese lords of the marches, or lords marcher, as they were often called,\r\nhad special privileges, but they were generally so fully occupied in\r\nfighting against each other and in seeking to increase their own wealth\r\nand power that the original object of their appointment was entirely\r\nforgotten. The condition of the marches grew worse and worse, and during\r\ndisturbed reigns, like those of Henry III. and Edward II., lawlessness\r\nwas rampant and rebellion was centred therein. A more satisfactory\r\ncondition of affairs, however, prevailed after the conclusion of the\r\nWars of the Roses; and the establishment by Henry VIII. in 1542 of a\r\ncouncil of Wales and the marches was followed by a notable diminution of\r\ndisorder in this region. About the time of Elizabeth the Welsh marches\r\nceased to have any but an historical importance. In 1328 Roger Mortimer,\r\na member of one of the most powerful of the marcher families, was\r\ncreated earl of March (_comes de marchia Waliae_), and in the reign of\r\nEdward III. (1354) the marches were declared to be no part of the\r\nprincipality, but directly subject to the English crown. It is difficult\r\nto define the boundaries of the Welsh marches, as their extent varied\r\nconsiderably from time to time, but under Edward I. and again under the\r\nLancastrian kings the marcher lordships included more than half of the\r\narea of Wales; they embraced practically the whole of the principality\r\nexcept the counties of Anglesea, Carnarvon and Merioneth in the north\r\nand Carmarthen and Cardigan in the south, together with parts of the\r\nEnglish border counties, Monmouth, Hereford and Shropshire.\r\n\r\nThe debateable ground between England and Scotland was also known as the\r\nmarches, although its condition began to attract the attention of the\r\nsouthern kingdom somewhat later than was the case with Wales.\r\nArrangements were made for garrisoning them and at one time they were\r\ndivided into three sections: the east, the west, and the middle marches,\r\nthe oversight of each being entrusted to a warden. Roughly speaking,\r\nthey embraced the modern counties of Northumberland and Cumberland,\r\ntogether with a tract on the Scottish side of the border. The need for\r\nprotecting them ceased soon after the accession of James VI. of Scotland\r\nto the English throne, and they have now only an historical and\r\nlegendary significance. About 1200 Patrick de Dunbar, earl of Dunbar,\r\ncalled himself earl of March, taking the name from the merse, or march,\r\na tract of land in Berwickshire.\r\n\r\nIn France under the _ancien régime_ there was a county of La Marche, and\r\nin north-east Germany there was the county of La Marck, now part of the\r\nkingdom of Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHE, or LA MARCHE, one of the former provinces of France. It owes its\r\nname to its position, it having been in the 10th century a march or\r\nborder district between the duchy of Aquitaine and the domains of the\r\nFrankish kings in central France. Sometimes it was called the _Marche\r\nLimousine_, and originally it was a small district cut partly from\r\nLimousin and partly from Poitou. Its area was increased during the 13th\r\ncentury, after which, however, it remained unaltered until the time of\r\nthe Revolution. It was bounded on the N. by Berry; on the E. by\r\nBourbonnais and Auvergne; on the S. by Limousin; and on the W. by\r\nPoitou. It embraced the greater part of the modern department of Creuse,\r\na considerable part of Haute Vienne, and a fragment of Indre. Its area\r\nwas about 1900 sq. m.; its capital was Charroux and later Guéret, and\r\namong its other principal towns were Dorat, Bellac and Confolens.\r\n\r\nMarche first appears as a separate fief about the middle of the 10th\r\ncentury when William III., duke of Aquitaine, gave it to one of his\r\nvassals named Boso, who took the title of count. In the 12th century it\r\npassed to the counts of Limousin, and this house retained it until the\r\ndeath of the childless Count Hugh in 1303, when it was seized by the\r\nFrench king, Philip IV. In 1316 it was made a duchy for Prince Charles,\r\nafterwards King Charles IV., and a few years later (1327) it passed into\r\nthe hands of the family of Bourbon. The family of Armagnac held it from\r\n1435 to 1477, when it reverted to the Bourbons, and in 1527 it was\r\nseized by Francis I. and became part of the domains of the French crown.\r\nIt was divided into Haute Marche and Basse Marche, the estates of the\r\nformer being in existence until the 17th century. From 1470 until the\r\nRevolution the province was under the jurisdiction of the parlement of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n  See A. Thomas, _Les États provinciaux de la France centrale_ (1879).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHE, a town of Belgium in the province of Luxemburg, 33 m. S.W. of\r\nLiége and about 28 m. S.E. of Namur. Pop. (1904), 3540. It dates from\r\nthe 7th century, when it was the chief town of the _pagus falmiensis_,\r\nas it still is of the same district now called Famène. Formerly it was\r\nfortified, and a treaty was signed there in 1577 between Philip II. and\r\nthe United Provinces. In 1792 Lafayette was taken prisoner by the\r\nAustrians in a skirmish near it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHENA, a town of southern Spain, in the province of Seville, on the\r\nCordova-Utrera and Marchena-La Roda railways. Pop. (1900), 12,468.\r\nMarchena occupies a sandy valley near the river Corbones, a left-hand\r\nterritory of the Guadalquivir. Formerly it was surrounded with walls and\r\ntowers, a large portion of which still remains. Among the principal\r\nbuildings is the palace of the dukes of Arcos, within the enclosure of\r\nwhich is an ancient Moorish building, now the church of Santa Maria de\r\nla Mota. At the eastern end of the town is a sulphur spring. There is\r\nsome trade in wheat, barley, olives, oil and wine. Marchena (perhaps the\r\n_Castra Gemina_ of Pliny) was taken from the Moors by St Ferdinand in\r\n1240.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHENA RUIZ DE CASTRO, JOSÉ (1768-1821?), Spanish author, was born at\r\nUtrera on the 18th of November 1768 and studied with distinction at the\r\nuniversity of Seville. He took minor orders and was for some time\r\nprofessor at the seminary of Vergara, but he became a convert to the\r\ndoctrines of the French _philosophes_, scandalizing his acquaintances by\r\nhis professions of materialism and his denunciations of celibacy. His\r\nwritings being brought before the Inquisition in 1792, Marchena escaped\r\nto Paris, where he is said to have collaborated with Marat in _L'Ami du\r\npeuple_; at a later date he organized a revolutionary movement at\r\nBayonne, returned to Paris, avowed his sympathies with the Girondists,\r\nand refused the advances of Robespierre. He acted as editor of _L'Ami\r\ndes lois_ and other French journals till 1799, when he was expelled from\r\nFrance; he succeeded, however, in obtaining employment under Moreau,\r\nupon whose fall in 1804 he declared himself a Bonapartist. In 1808 he\r\naccompanied Murat to Spain as private secretary; in this same year he\r\nwas imprisoned by the Inquisition, but was released by Joseph Bonaparte,\r\nwho appointed him editor of the official _Gaceta_. In 1813 Marchena\r\nretired to Valencia, and thence to France, where he supported himself by\r\ntranslating into Spanish the works of Montesquieu, Rousseau, Voltaire\r\nand Volney. The Liberal triumph of 1820 opened Spain to him once more,\r\nbut he was coldly received by the revolutionary party. He died at\r\nMadrid shortly before the 26th of February 1821. The interest of his\r\nvoluminous writings is almost wholly ephemeral, but they are excellent\r\nspecimens of trenchant journalism. His _Fragmentum Petronii_ (Basel,\r\n1802), which purports to reconstruct missing passages in the current\r\ntext of Petronius, is a testimony to Marchena's fine scholarship; but,\r\nby the irony of fate, Marchena is best known by his ode to Christ\r\nCrucified, which breathes a spirit of profound and tender piety.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHES, THE (It. _Le Marche_), a territorial division of Italy,\r\nembracing the provinces of Pesaro and Urbino, Ancona, Macerata, and\r\nAscoli Piceno, with an area of 3763 sq. m., and a population of\r\n1,088,763 in 1901. It is bounded by the Emilia on the N., the Adriatic\r\non the E., the Abruzzi on the S., and Umbria and Tuscany on the W. The\r\nfour provinces follow one another in the order given from north to south\r\nand have a certain amount of coast-line. The chief rivers, all of which\r\nrun into the Adriatic eastwards and north-eastwards, are the Metauro\r\n(anc. _Metaurus_, q.v.) and the Tronto (anc. _Truentus_), the latter\r\nforming the southern boundary of the _compartimento_ for some distance.\r\nExcept for the river valleys and the often very narrow coast strip, the\r\ngeneral level is more than 500 ft. above the sea. The lower hills are\r\nvery largely composed of loose, clayey, unstable earth, while the\r\nApennines are of limestone. The province of Pesaro and Urbino falls\r\nwithin the boundaries of the ancient Umbria (q.v.), while the territory\r\nof the other three belonged to Picenum (q.v.). The railway from Bologna\r\nto Brindisi runs along the coast-line of the entire territory. At Ancona\r\nit is joined by the main line from Foligno and Rome; at Porto Civitanova\r\nis a branch to Macerata, San Severino and Fabriano (a station on the\r\nline from Ancona to Rome and the junction for Urbino); at Porto S.\r\nGiorgio is a branch to Fermo and, at Porto d'Ascoli, a branch to Ascoli\r\nPiceno. But, with the exception of the railway along the coast, there is\r\nno communication north and south, owing to the mountainous nature of the\r\ncountry, except by somewhat devious roads.\r\n\r\nOwing largely to the _mezzadria_ or _métayer_ system, under which\r\nproducts are equally divided between the owners and the cultivators of\r\nthe land, the soil is fairly highly cultivated, though naturally poor in\r\nquality. The silk industries, making of straw-plait and straw hats,\r\nrearing of silkworms and cocoons, with some sugar-refining, tobacco,\r\nterra-cotta manufacture, brickworks and ironworks, furnish the chief\r\noccupations of the people next after agriculture and pastoral pursuits.\r\nAnother important branch of activity is the paper industry, especially\r\nat Fabriano. Chiaravalle possesses one of the largest tobacco factories\r\nof the Italian _régie_. Limestone quarries and sulphur mines supply\r\nbuilding stone and sulphur to the regions of central Italy; chalk and\r\npetroleum are also found. As regards maritime trade the province\r\npossesses facilities in the port of Ancona (the only really good\r\nharbour, where are also important shipbuilding works), the canal ports\r\nof Senegallia (Sinigaglia), Pesaro, Fano and other smaller harbours\r\nchiefly used by fishing boats. Fishing is carried on by the entire coast\r\npopulation, which furnishes a large contingent of sailors to the Italian\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nFor the early history of the territory of the Marches see PICENUM. From\r\nthe Carolingian period onwards the name Marca begins to appear--first\r\nthe Marca Fermana for the mountainous part of Picenum, the Marca\r\nCamerinese for the district farther north, including a part of Umbria,\r\nand the Marca Anconitana for the former Pentapolis. In 1080 the Marca\r\nAnconitana was given in investiture to Robert Guiscard by Gregory VII.,\r\nto whom the countess Matilda ceded the Marches of Camerino and of Fermo.\r\nIn 1105 we find the emperor Henry IV. investing Werner with the whole\r\nterritory of the three marches under the name of March of Ancona. It was\r\nafterwards once more recovered by the Church and governed by papal\r\nlegates. It became part of the kingdom of Italy in 1860.\r\n\r\nThe pictorial art of the Marches from the 13th century onwards has\r\nbecome the object of considerable interest since the important\r\nexhibition held at Macerata in 1905, when many interesting works,\r\nscattered all over the district in small towns and villages, were\r\nbrought together. The result was something of a revelation, for, though\r\nthe influence of Umbria was always considerable, there were many\r\nindependent elements (see F. M. Perkins in _Rassegna d' Arte_, 1906, 49\r\nsqq.).     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHMONT, EARLS OF. The 1st earl of Marchmont was Sir Patrick Hume or\r\nHome (1641-1724), son of Sir Patrick Hume, bart. (d. 1648), of Polwarth,\r\nBerwickshire, and a descendant of another Sir Patrick Hume, a supporter\r\nof the Reformation in Scotland. A member of the same family was\r\nAlexander Hume (c. 1560-1609), the Scottish poet, whose _Hymns and\r\nSacred Songs_ were published in 1599 (new ed. 1832). Polwarth, as\r\nPatrick Hume was usually called, became a member of the Scottish\r\nparliament in 1665. Here he was active in opposing the harsh policy of\r\nthe earl of Lauderdale towards the Covenanters, and for his contumacy he\r\nwas imprisoned. After his release he went to London, where he associated\r\nhimself with the duke of Monmouth. Suspected of complicity in the Rye\r\nHouse plot, he remained for a time in hiding and then crossed over to\r\nthe Netherlands, where he took part in the deliberations of Monmouth,\r\nthe earl of Argyll and other exiles about the projected invasion of\r\nGreat Britain. Although he appeared to distrust Argyll, Polwarth sailed\r\nto Scotland with him in 1685, and after the failure of the rising he\r\nescaped to Utrecht, where he lived in great poverty until 1688. He\r\naccompanied William of Orange to England, and in 1689 he was again a\r\nmember of the Scottish parliament. In 1690 he was made a peer as Lord\r\nPolwarth; in 1696 he became lord high chancellor of Scotland, and in\r\n1697 was created earl of Marchmont. When Anne became queen in 1702 he\r\nwas deprived of the chancellorship. He died on the 2nd of August 1724.\r\nHis son Alexander, the 2nd earl (1676-1740), took the name of Campbell\r\ninstead of Hume after his marriage in 1697 with Margaret, daughter and\r\nheiress of Sir George Campbell of Cessnock, Ayrshire. He was a lord of\r\nsession from 1704 to 1714; ambassador to Denmark from 1715 to 1721, and\r\nlord clerk register from 1716 to 1733. His son Hugh Hume, 3rd earl\r\n(1708-1794), who entered parliament in 1734 at the same time as his twin\r\nbrother Alexander (d. 1756), afterwards lord clerk register of Scotland,\r\nwas keeper of the great seal of Scotland, one of Bolingbroke's most\r\nintimate friends and one of Pope's executors. His two sons having\r\npredeceased their father, the earldom became dormant, Marchmont House,\r\nBerwickshire, and the estates passing to Sir Hugh Purves, bart., a\r\ndescendant of the 2nd earl, who took the name of Hume-Campbell. The 3rd\r\nearl had, however, three daughters, one of whom, Diana (d. 1827),\r\nmarried Walter Scott of Harden, Berwickshire; and in 1835 her son Hugh\r\nHepburne-Scott (1758-1841) successfully claimed the Scottish barony of\r\nPolwarth. In 1867 his grandson, Walter Hugh (b. 1838), became 6th Lord\r\nPolwarth.\r\n\r\n  See _The Marchmont Papers_, ed. Sir G. H. Rose (1831).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCHPANE, or MARZIPAN, a sweetmeat made of sweet almonds and sugar\r\npounded and worked into a paste, and moulded into various shapes, or\r\nused in the icing of cakes, &c. The best marchpane comes from Germany,\r\nthat from Königsberg being celebrated. The origin of the word has been\r\nmuch discussed. It is common in various forms in most European\r\nlanguages, Romanic or Teutonic; Italian has _marzapane_, French\r\n_massepain_, and German _marzipan_, which has in English to some extent\r\nsuperseded the true English form \"marchpane.\" Italian seems to have been\r\nthe source from which the word passed into other languages. In Johann\r\nBurchard's _Diarium curiae romanae_ (1483-1492) the Latin form appears\r\nas _martiapanis_ (Du Cange, _Glossarium_ s.v.), and Minshseu explains\r\nthe word as _Martius Panis_, bread of Mars, from the \"towers, castles\r\nand such like\" that appeared on elaborate works of the confectioner's\r\nart made of this sweatmeat. Another derivation is that from Gr. [Greek:\r\nmaza], barley cake, and Lat. _panis_. A connexion has been sought with\r\nthe name of a Venetian coin, _matapanus_ (Du Cange, s.v.), on which was\r\na figure of Christ enthroned, struck by Enrico Dandolo, doge of Venice\r\n(1192-1205). From the coin the word was applied to a small box, and\r\nhence apparently to the sweetmeat contained in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCIAN (c. 390-457), emperor of the East (450-457), was born in Thrace\r\nor Illyria, and spent his early life as an obscure soldier. He\r\nsubsequently served for nineteen years under Ardaburius and Aspar, and\r\ntook part in the wars against the Persians and Vandals. Through the\r\ninfluence of these generals he became a captain of the guards, and was\r\nlater raised to the rank of tribune and senator. On the death of\r\nTheodosius II. he was chosen as consort by the latter's sister and\r\nsuccessor, Pulcheria, and called upon to govern an empire greatly\r\nhumbled and impoverished by the ravages of the Huns. Marcian repudiated\r\nthe payment of tribute to Attila; he reformed the finances, checked\r\nextravagance, and repeopled the devastated districts. He repelled\r\nattacks upon Syria and Egypt (452), and quelled disturbances on the\r\nArmenian frontier (456). The other notable event of his reign is the\r\nCouncil of Chalcedon (451), in which Marcian endeavoured to mediate\r\nbetween the rival schools of theology.\r\n\r\n  See Gibbon, _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_ (ed. Bury,\r\n  London, 1896), iii. 384, iv. 444-445; J. Bury, _The Later Roman\r\n  Empire_ (London, 1889), i. 135-136.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCIANUS (c. A.D. 400), Greek geographer, was born at Heraclea in\r\nPontus. Two of his works have been preserved in a more or less mutilated\r\ncondition. In the first, the _Periplus of the Outer Sea_, in two books,\r\nin which he proposed to give a complete description of the coasts of the\r\neastern and western oceans, his chief authority is Ptolemy; the\r\ndistances from one point to another are given in stades, with the object\r\nof rendering the work easier for the ordinary student. In this he\r\nfollows Protagoras, who, according to Photius (cod. 188), wrote a sketch\r\nof geography in six books. The work contains nothing that cannot be\r\nlearned from Ptolemy, whom he follows in calling the promontory of the\r\nNovantae (_Mull of Galloway_) the most northern point of Britain.\r\nImproving on Ptolemy, he makes the island of Taprobane (_Ceylon_) twenty\r\ntimes as large as it is in reality. The second, the _Periplus of the\r\nInner Sea_ (the Mediterranean), is a meagre epitome of a similar work by\r\nMenippus of Pergamum, who lived during the times of Augustus and\r\nTiberius. It contains a description of the southern coast of the Euxine\r\nfrom the Thracian Bosporus to the river Iris in Pontus. A few fragments\r\nremain of an epitome by Marcianus of the eleven books of the\r\n_Geographumena_ of Artemidorus of Ephesus.\r\n\r\n  See J.

In the period between 130 and 180\r\nA.D. the varied and complicated Christian fellowships in the Roman Empire\r\ncrystallized into close and mutually exclusive societies--churches with\r\nfixed constitutions and creeds, schools with distinctive esoteric\r\ndoctrines, associations for worship with peculiar mysteries, and ascetic\r\nsects with special rules of conduct. Of ecclesiastical organizations the\r\nmost important, next to Catholicism, was the Marcionite community. Like\r\nthe Catholic Church, this body professed to comprehend everything\r\nbelonging to Christianity. It admitted all believers without distinction\r\nof age, sex, rank or culture. It was no mere school for the learned,\r\ndisclosed no mysteries for the privileged, but sought to lay the\r\nfoundation of the Christian community on the pure gospel, the authentic\r\ninstitutes of Christ. The pure gospel, however, Marcion found to be\r\neverywhere more or less corrupted and mutilated in the Christian circles\r\nof his time. His undertaking thus resolved itself into a reformation of\r\nChristendom. This reformation was to deliver Christendom from false\r\nJewish doctrines by restoring the Pauline conception of the gospel,--Paul\r\nbeing, according to Marcion, the only apostle who had rightly understood\r\nthe new message of salvation as delivered by Christ. In Marcion's own\r\nview, therefore, the founding of his church--to which he was first driven\r\nby opposition--amounts to a reformation of Christendom through a return\r\nto the gospel of Christ and to Paul; nothing was to be accepted beyond\r\nthat. This of itself shows that it is a mistake to reckon Marcion among\r\nthe Gnostics. A dualist he certainly was, but he was not a Gnostic. For\r\nhe ascribed salvation, not to \"knowledge\" but to \"faith\"; he appealed\r\nopenly to the whole Christian world; and he nowhere consciously added\r\nforeign elements to the revelation given through Christ. It is true that\r\nin many features his Christian system--if we may use the\r\nexpression--resembles the so-called Gnostic systems; but the first duty\r\nof the historian is to point out what Marcion plainly aimed at; only in\r\nthe second place have we to inquire how far the result corresponded with\r\nthose purposes.\r\n\r\n  The doctrines of Marcion and the history of his churches from the 2nd\r\n  to the 7th century are known to us from the controversial works of the\r\n  Catholic fathers. From Justin onwards, almost every eminent Church\r\n  teacher takes some notice of Marcion, while very many write extensive\r\n  treatises against him. The most important of those which have come\r\n  down to us are the controversial pieces of Irenaeus (in his great work\r\n  against heretics), Tertullian (_Adv. Marc._ i.-v.), Hippolytus,\r\n  Pseudo-Origen Adamantius, Epiphanius, and the Armenian Esnik.[1] From\r\n  these works the contents of the Marcionite Gospel, and also the text\r\n  of Paul's epistles in Marcion's recension, can be settled with\r\n  tolerable accuracy. His opponents, moreover, have preserved some\r\n  expressions of his, with extracts from his principal work; so that our\r\n  knowledge of Marcion's views is in part derived from the best sources.\r\n\r\nMarcion was a wealthy shipowner, belonging to Sinope in Pontus. He\r\nappears to have been a convert from Paganism to Christianity, although\r\nit was asserted in later times that his father had been a bishop. That\r\nreport is probably as untrustworthy as another, that he was\r\nexcommunicated from the Church for seducing a virgin. What we know for\r\ncertain is that after the death of Hyginus, bishop of Rome (or c. 139\r\nA.D.), he arrived, in the course of his travels, at Rome, and made a\r\nhandsome donation of money to the local church. Even then, however, the\r\nleading features of his peculiar system must have been already thought\r\nout. At Rome he tried to gain acceptance for them in the college of\r\npresbyters and in the church; indeed he had previously made similar\r\nattempts in Asia Minor. But he now encountered such determined\r\nopposition from the majority of the congregation that he found it\r\nnecessary to withdraw from the great church and establish in Rome a\r\ncommunity of his own. This was about the year 144. The new society\r\nincreased in the two following decades; and very soon numerous\r\nsister-churches were flourishing in the east and west of the empire.\r\nMarcion took up his residence permanently in Rome, but still undertook\r\njourneys for the propagation of his opinions. In Rome he became\r\nacquainted with the Syrian Gnostic Cerdo, whose speculations influenced\r\nthe development of the Marcionite theology. Still Marcion seems never to\r\nhave abandoned his design of gaining over the whole Church to his\r\ngospel. The proof of this is found, partly in the fact that he tried to\r\nestablish relations with Polycarp of Smyrna, from whom he got a sharp\r\nrebuff, partly in a legend to the effect that towards the end of his\r\nlife he sought readmission to the Church. Such, presumably, was the\r\nconstruction put in after times on his earnest endeavour to unite\r\nChristians on the footing of the \"pure gospel.\" When he died is not\r\nknown, but his death can scarcely have been much later than the year\r\n165.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive teaching of Marcion originated in a comparison of the\r\nOld Testament with the gospel of Christ and the theology of the apostle\r\nPaul. Its motive was not cosmological or metaphysical, but religious and\r\nhistorical. In the gospel he found a God revealed who is goodness and\r\nlove, and who desires faith and love from men. This God he could not\r\ndiscover in the Old Testament; on the contrary, he saw there the\r\nrevelation of a just, stern, jealous, wrathful and variable God, who\r\nrequires from his servants blind obedience, fear and outward\r\nrighteousness. Overpowered by the majesty and novelty of the Christian\r\nmessage of salvation, too conscientious to rest satisfied with the\r\nordinary attempts at the solution of difficulties, while prevented by\r\nthe limitations of his time from reaching an historical insight into the\r\nrelation of Christianity to the Old Testament and to Judaism, he\r\nbelieved that he expressed Paul's view by the hypothesis of two Gods:\r\nthe just God of the law (the God of the Jews, who is also the Creator of\r\nthe world), and the good God, the Father of Jesus Christ. Paradoxes in\r\nthe history of religion and revelation which Paul draws out, and which\r\nMarcion's contemporaries passed by as utterly incomprehensible, are here\r\nmade the foundation of an ethico-dualistic conception of history and of\r\nreligion. It may be said that in the 2nd century only one\r\nChristian--Marcion--took the trouble to understand Paul; but it must be\r\nadded that he misunderstood him. The profound reflections of the apostle\r\non the radical antithesis of law and gospel, works and faith, were not\r\nappreciated in the 2nd century. Marcion alone perceived their decisive\r\nreligious importance, and with them confronted the legalizing, and in\r\nthis sense judaizing, tendencies of his Christian contemporaries. But\r\nthe Pauline ideas lost their truth under his treatment; for, when it is\r\ndenied that the God of redemption is at the same time the almighty Lord\r\nof heaven and earth, the gospel is turned upside down.\r\n\r\nThe assumption of two Gods necessarily led to cosmological speculations.\r\nUnder the influence of Cerdo, Marcion carried out his ethical dualism in\r\nthe sphere of cosmology; but the fact that his system is not free from\r\ncontradictions is the best proof that all along religious knowledge, and\r\nnot philosophical, had the chief values in his eyes. The main outlines\r\nof his teaching are as follows. Man is, in spirit, soul and body, a\r\ncreature of the just and wrathful god. This god created man from [Greek:\r\nulê] (matter),[2] and imposed on him a strict law. Since no one could\r\nkeep this law, the whole human race fell under the curse, temporal and\r\neternal, of the Demiurge. Then a higher God, hitherto unknown, and\r\nconcealed even from the Demiurge, took pity on the wretched, condemned\r\nrace of men. He sent his Son (whom Marcion probably regarded as a\r\nmanifestation of the supreme God Himself)[3] down to this earth in order\r\nto redeem men. Clothed in a visionary body, in the likeness of a man of\r\nthirty years old, the Son made his appearance in the fifteenth year of\r\nTiberius, and preached in the synagogue at Capernaum. But none of the\r\nJewish people understood him. Even the disciples whom he chose did not\r\nrecognize his true nature, but mistook him for the Messiah promised by\r\nthe Demiurge through the prophets, who as warrior and king was to come\r\nand set up the Jewish empire. The Demiurge himself did not suspect who\r\nthe stranger was; nevertheless he became angry with him, and, although\r\nJesus had punctually fulfilled his law, caused him to be nailed to the\r\ncross. By that act, however, he pronounced his own doom. For the risen\r\nChrist appeared before him in his glory, and charged him with having\r\nacted contrary to his own law. To make amends for this crime, the\r\nDemiurge had now to deliver up to the good God the souls of those who\r\nwere to be redeemed; they are, as it were, purchased from him by the\r\ndeath of Christ. Christ then proceeded to the underworld to deliver the\r\nspirits of the departed. It was not the Old Testament saints, however,\r\nbut only sinners and malefactors like Cain, Esau and Saul, who obeyed\r\nhis summons. The prophets and patriarchs, having been often deceived by\r\nthe Demiurge, suspected a trick and would not avail themselves of the\r\npromised salvation, remaining content with the bliss of being in\r\nAbraham's bosom. Then, to gain the living, Christ raised up Paul as his\r\napostle. He alone understood the gospel, and recognized the difference\r\nbetween the just God and the good. Accordingly, he opposed the original\r\napostles with their Judaistic doctrines, and founded small congregations\r\nof true Christians. But the preaching of the false Jewish Christians\r\ngained the upper hand; nay, they even falsified the evangelical oracles\r\nand the letters of Paul. Marcion himself was the next raised up by the\r\ngood God, to proclaim once more the true gospel. This he did by setting\r\naside the spurious gospels, purging the real gospel (the Gospel of Luke)\r\nfrom supposed judaizing interpolations, and restoring the true text of\r\nthe Pauline epistles.[4] He likewise composed a book, called the\r\n_Antitheses_,[5] in which he proved the disparity of the two Gods, from\r\na comparison of the Old Testament with the evangelical writings.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these writings Marcion proclaimed the true Christianity,\r\nand founded churches. He taught that all who put their trust in the good\r\nGod, and his crucified Son, renounce their allegiance to the Demiurge,\r\nand approve themselves by good works of love, shall be saved. But he\r\ntaught further--and here we trace the influence of the current\r\ngnosticism on Marcion--that only the spirit of man is saved by the good\r\nGod; the body, because material, perishes. Accordingly his ethics also\r\nwere thoroughly dualistic. By the \"works of the Demiurge,\" which the\r\nChristian is to flee, he meant the whole \"service of the perishable.\"\r\nThe Christian must shun everything sensual, and especially marriage, and\r\nfree himself from the body by strict asceticism. The original ethical\r\ncontrast of \"good\" and \"just\" is thus transformed into the cosmological\r\ncontrast of \"spirit\" and \"matter.\" The good God appears as the god of\r\nspirit, the Old Testament God as the god of matter. That is Gnosticism;\r\nbut it is at the same time illogical. For, since, according to Marcion,\r\nthe spirit of man is derived, not from the good, but from the just God,\r\nit is impossible to see why the spiritual should yet be more closely\r\nrelated to the good God than the material. There is yet another\r\ndirection in which the system ends with a contradiction. According to\r\nMarcion, the good God never judges, but everywhere manifests His\r\ngoodness--is, therefore, not to be feared, but simply to be loved, as a\r\nfather. But here the question occurs, What becomes of the men who do not\r\nbelieve the gospel? Marcion answers, The good God does not judge them,\r\nbut merely removes them from His presence. Then they fall under the\r\npower of the Demiurge, who--rewards them for their fidelity? No, says\r\nMarcion, but on the contrary--punishes them in his hell! The\r\ncontradiction here is palpable; and at the same time the antithesis of\r\n\"just\" and \"good\" ultimately vanishes. For the Demiurge now appears as\r\nan inferior being, who in reality executes the purposes of the good God.\r\nIt is plain that dualism here terminates in the idea of the sole\r\nsupremacy of the good God.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that even in the 2nd century the\r\ndisciples of Marcion diverged in several directions. Rigorous\r\nasceticism, the rejection of the Old Testament, and the recognition of\r\nthe \"new God\" remained common to all Marcionites, who, moreover, like\r\nthe Catholics, lived together in close communities ruled by bishops and\r\npresbyters (although their constitution was originally very loose, and\r\nsought to avoid every appearance of \"legality\"). Some, however, accepted\r\nthree first principles (the evil, the just, the good); others held by\r\ntwo, but regarded the Demiurge as the god of evil, i.e. the devil; while\r\na third party, like Apelles, the most distinguished of Marcion's pupils,\r\nsaw in the Demiurge only an apostate angel of the good God--thus\r\nreturning to monotheism. The golden age of the Marcionite churches falls\r\nbetween the years 150 and 250. During that time they were really\r\ndangerous to the great Church; for in fact they maintained certain\r\ngenuine Christian ideas, which the Catholic Church had forgotten. The\r\nearliest inscription (A.D. 318) on a Christian place of worship is\r\nMarcionite, and was found on a stone which had stood over the doorway of\r\na house in a Syrian village. From the beginning of the 4th century they\r\nbegan to die out in the West, or rather they fell a prey to Manichaeism.\r\nIn the East also many Marcionites went over to the Manichaeans; but\r\nthere they survived much longer. They can be traced down to the 7th\r\ncentury, and then they seem to vanish. But it was unquestionably from\r\nMarcionite impulses that the new sects of the Paulicians and Bogomils\r\narose; and in so far as the western Cathari, and the antinomian and\r\nanticlerical sects of the 13th century are connected with these, they\r\nalso may be included in the history of Marcionitism.\r\n\r\n  See A.

Preceded by Estevanico, the negro companion of\r\nCabeza de Vaca in his wanderings and the \"Black Mexican\" of Zuni\r\ntraditions, Fray Marcos left Culiacan in March 1539, crossed\r\nsouth-eastern Arizona, penetrated to Zuni or the \"Seven Cities of\r\nCibola,\" and in September returned to Culiacan. He saw Zuni only from a\r\ndistance, and his description of it as equal in size to the city of\r\nMexico was probably exact; but he embodied much mere hearsay in his\r\nreport, the _Descubrimiento de las siete ciudades_, which led F. V. de\r\nCoronado to make his famous expedition next year to Zuni, of which Fray\r\nMarcos was the guide; and the realities proved a great disappointment.\r\nFray Marcos was made Provincial of his order for Mexico before the\r\nsecond trip to Zuni, and returned in 1541 to the capital, where he died\r\non the 25th of March 1558.\r\n\r\n  The _Descubrimiento_ is one of the world's famous narratives of\r\n  travel.

He was\r\neducated at Besançon and at the college of St Louis, Paris. He worked in\r\nearly years with J. Thurmann (1804-1855) on the geology of the Jura\r\nmountains. In 1847 he went to North America as travelling geologist for\r\nthe _Jardin des Plantes_, and in the following year in Boston he joined\r\nAgassiz, whom he had met in Switzerland, and accompanied him to the Lake\r\nSuperior region. Marcou spent two years in studying the geology of\r\nvarious parts of the United States and Canada, and returned to Europe\r\nfor a short time in 1850. In 1853 he published a _Geological Map of the\r\nUnited States, and the British Provinces of North America_. In 1855 he\r\nbecame professor of geology and palaeontology at the polytechnic school\r\nof Zurich, but relinquished this office in 1859, and in 1861 again\r\nreturned to the United States, when he assisted Agassiz in founding the\r\nMuseum of Comparative Zoology. In 1861 he published his _Geological Map\r\nof the World_ (2nd ed. 1875). Of his published papers the more\r\nnoteworthy are those on the Jura-Cretaceous formations of the Jura, on\r\nthe \"Dyas\" (Permian) of Nebraska, and on the Taconic rocks of Vermont\r\nand Canada. His other works include _Lettres sur les roches du Jura et\r\nleur distribution géographique dans les deux hémisphères_ (1857-1860)\r\nand _Geology of North America_ (1858). Marcou died at Cambridge, Mass.,\r\non the 17th of April 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS (121-180), Roman emperor and Stoic\r\nphilosopher, was born in Rome A.D. 121, the date of his birth being\r\nvariously stated as the 6th, 21st and 26th of April. His original name\r\nwas Marcus Annius Verus.[1] His mother Domitia Calvilla (or Lucilla) was\r\na lady of consular rank, and the family of his father Annius Verus\r\n(prefect of the city and thrice consul), originally Spanish, had\r\nreceived patrician rank from Vespasian. Marcus was three months old when\r\nhis father died, and was thereupon adopted by his grandfather. The moral\r\ntraining which he received from his grandfather and his mother must have\r\nbeen all but perfect. The noble qualities of the child attracted the\r\nattention of Hadrian, who, playing upon the name \"Verus,\" said that it\r\nshould be changed to \"Verissimus\" (BHPICCIMOC on medals). Hadrian\r\nadopted, as his successor, Titus Antoninus Pius (uncle of Marcus), on\r\ncondition that he in turn adopted both Marcus (then seventeen) and\r\nLucius Ceionius Commodus, the son of Aelius Caesar, who had originally\r\nbeen intended by Hadrian as his successor, but had died before him.\r\nMarcus had been, at the age of fifteen, betrothed to Fabia, the sister\r\nof Commodus; the engagement was broken off by Antoninus Pius, and he was\r\nbetrothed to Faustina, the daughter of the latter. In 139 the title of\r\nCaesar was conferred upon him and he dropped the name of Verus. The full\r\nname he then bore was Marcus Aelius Aurelius Antoninus, Aelius coming\r\nfrom Hadrian's family, and Aurelius being the original name of Antoninus\r\nPius. In 140 he was made consul.\r\n\r\nThe education of Aurelius in his youth was minute (see _Medit._ i.\r\n1-16). A better guardian than Antoninus Pius could not be conceived.\r\nMarcus himself says, \"To the gods I am indebted for having good\r\ngrandfathers, good parents, a good sister, good teachers, good\r\nassociates, good kinsmen and friends, nearly everything good.\" He was\r\neducated, not at school, but by tutors, Herodes Atticus and M. Cornelius\r\nFronto (q.v.) in the usual curriculum of rhetoric and poetry; but at the\r\nage of eleven he became acquainted with Diognetus the painter and Stoic\r\nphilosopher (_Hist. script. aug._ i. 305, notes), was fascinated by the\r\nphilosophy he taught, assumed the dress of his sect, and ultimately\r\nabandoned rhetoric and poetry for philosophy and law, having among his\r\nteachers of the one Sextus of Chaeronea, grandson of Plutarch, and later\r\nQ. Junius Rusticus, and of the other L. Volusius Maecianus (or\r\nMetianus), a distinguished jurist. He went thoroughly into the practice\r\nas well as the theory of Stoicism, and lived so abstemious and laborious\r\na life that he injured his health. From his Stoic teachers he learned to\r\nwork hard, to deny himself, to avoid listening to slander, to endure\r\nmisfortunes, never to deviate from his purpose, to be grave without\r\naffectation, delicate in correcting others, \"not frequently to say to\r\nany one, nor to write in a letter, that I have no leisure,\" nor to\r\nexcuse the neglect of duties by alleging urgent occupations. Through all\r\nhis Stoical training Aurelius preserved the natural sweetness of his\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Antoninus Pius (138 to 161), the concord between him\r\nand Aurelius was complete; Capitolinus (_c_. 7) says \"nec praeter duas\r\nnoctes per tot annos mansit diversis vicibus.\" The two were associated\r\nin the administration and in the simple country occupations of the\r\nseaside villa of Lorium, the birthplace of Pius, to which he loved to\r\nretire. It has been assumed on the strength of a passage in Capitolinus\r\nthat Aurelius married Faustina in 146, but the passage is not clear, and\r\nother evidence points strongly to 140; at all events it seems certain\r\nthat a daughter was born to him in 140. Antoninus Pius died in 161,\r\nhaving recommended as his successor Aurelius, then forty years of age,\r\nwithout mentioning Commodus, his other adopted son, commonly called\r\nLucius Verus. It is believed that the senate urged Aurelius to take the\r\nsole administration. But he showed the magnanimity of his nature by at\r\nonce admitting Verus as his partner, giving him the tribunician and\r\nproconsular powers, and the titles Caesar and Augustus. This was the\r\nfirst time that Rome had two emperors as colleagues. Verus, a weak,\r\nself-indulgent man, had a high respect for his adoptive brother, and\r\ndeferred uniformly to his judgment. In the first year of his reign\r\nFaustina gave birth to twins, one of whom became the emperor Commodus.\r\n\r\nThe early part of the reign of Aurelius was clouded by national\r\nmisfortunes. An inundation of the Tiber swept away a large part of Rome,\r\ndestroying fields, drowning cattle, and causing a famine (162); then\r\ncame earthquakes, fires and plagues of insects; the soldiers in Britain\r\ntried to induce their general Statius Priscus to proclaim himself\r\nemperor; finally, the Parthians under Vologaeses III. resumed\r\nhostilities, annihilated the Roman forces under Severianus at Elegia in\r\nCappadocia, and devastated Syria. Verus, originally a man of\r\nconsiderable courage and ability, was sent to oppose the Parthians, but\r\ngave himself up to sensual excesses, and the Roman cause in Armenia\r\nwould have been lost, and the empire itself, perhaps, imperilled, had\r\nnot Verus had under him able generals,[2] the chief of whom was Avidius\r\nCassius (see CASSIUS, AVIDIUS). By them the Parthian War was brought to\r\na conclusion in 165, but Verus and his army brought back with them a\r\nterrible pestilence, which spread through the whole empire. The people\r\nseem to have thought that the last days of the empire had come. The\r\nParthians had at the best been beaten, not subdued; the Britons\r\nthreatened revolt; there were signs that various tribes beyond the Alps\r\nintended to break into Italy. Indeed, the bulk of the reign of Aurelius\r\nwas spent in efforts to ward off the attacks of the barbarians. He went\r\nhimself to the wars with Verus in 167, first to Aquileia and then on\r\ninto Pannonia and Noricum, wintering at Sirmium in Pannonia. Ultimately\r\nthe Marcomanni, the fiercest of the tribes that inhabited the country\r\nbetween Illyria and the sources of the Danube, sued for peace in 168. In\r\nJanuary or February 160 Verus died at Altinum, apparently of apoplexy,\r\nthough some ventured to say that he was poisoned by Aurelius.\r\n\r\nAurelius was thenceforth indisputed master of the empire, during one of\r\nthe most troubled periods of its history. His reign is well described by\r\nF. W. Farrar (_Seekers after God_): \"He regarded himself as being, in\r\nfact, the servant of all. The registry of the citizens, the suppression\r\nof litigation, the elevation of public morals, the care of minors, the\r\nretrenchment of public expenses, the limitation of gladiatorial games\r\nand shows, the care of roads, the restoration of senatorial privileges,\r\nthe appointment of none but worthy magistrates, even the regulation of\r\nstreet traffic, these and numberless other duties so completely absorbed\r\nhis attention that, in spite of indifferent health, they often kept him\r\nat severe labour from early morning till long after midnight. His\r\nposition, indeed, often necessitated his presence at games and shows,\r\nbut on these occasions he occupied himself either in reading, in being\r\nread to, or in writing notes. He was one of those who held that nothing\r\nshould be done hastily, and that few crimes were worse than the waste of\r\ntime.\" The comprehensiveness of his legal and judicial reforms is very\r\nstriking. Slaves, heirs, women and children, were benefited, and he made\r\nserious attempts to deal with the steady fall in the birth-rate of\r\nlegitimate children.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 169 two of the German tribes, the Quadi and the\r\nMarcomanni, with their allies the Vandals, Iazyges and Sarmatians,\r\nrenewed hostilities and, for three years, Aurelius resided almost\r\nconstantly at Carnuntum. In the end the Marcomanni were driven out of\r\nPannonia, and were almost destroyed in their retreat across the Danube.\r\nIn 174 Aurelius gained over the Quadi a decisive victory, which is\r\ncommemorated by one of the sculptures on the column of Antonine. The\r\nstory is that the Romans, entangled in a defile, were suffering from\r\nthirst. A sudden storm gave abundance of rain, while hail and thunder\r\nconfounded their enemies, and enabled the Romans to gain an easy and\r\ncomplete victory. This triumph was universally considered at the time,\r\nand for long afterwards, to have been a miracle, and bore the title of\r\n\"The Miracle of the Thundering Legion.\" The pagan writers (e.g. Dio\r\nCassius, lxx. 8-10) ascribed the victory to the magic arts of an\r\nEgyptian named Arnuphis who prevailed on Mercury and other gods to give\r\nrelief, while the Christians attributed it to the prayers of their\r\nbrethren in a legion to which, they affirmed, the emperor then gave the\r\nname of \"The Thundering.\" Dacier, however, and others who adhere to the\r\nChristian view of the miracle, admit that the appellation of\r\n\"Thundering\" or \"Lightning\" ([Greek: keraunobolos], or [Greek:\r\nkeraunophoros]) was given to the legion because there was a figure of\r\nlightning on their shields. It has also been virtually proved that it\r\nhad the title even in the reign of Augustus.\r\n\r\nAurelius next marched to Germany. There news reached him that Avidius\r\nCassius, the commander of the Roman troops in Asia, had revolted and\r\nproclaimed himself emperor (175). But after three months Cassius was\r\nassassinated, and his head was brought to Aurelius, who with\r\ncharacteristic magnanimity, persuaded the senate to pardon all the\r\nfamily of Cassius. It is a proof of the wisdom of Aurelius's clemency\r\nthat he had little or no trouble in pacifying the provinces which had\r\nbeen the scene of rebellion. He treated them all with forbearance, and\r\nit is said that when the correspondence of Cassius was brought him he\r\nburnt it without reading it. During his journey of pacification,\r\nFaustina, who had borne him eleven children, died. Dio Cassius and\r\nCapitolinus charge Faustina with the most shameless infidelity to her\r\nhusband, who is even blamed for not paying heed to her crimes. But none\r\nof these stories rests on trustworthy evidence; on the other hand, there\r\ncan be no doubt that Aurelius trusted her while she lived, and mourned\r\nher loss.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Faustina and the pacification of Syria, Aurelius\r\nproceeded, on his return to Italy, through Athens, and was initiated in\r\nthe Eleusinian mysteries, the reason assigned for his doing so being\r\nthat it was his custom to conform to the established rites of the\r\ncountries he visited. He gave large sums of money for the endowment of\r\nchairs in philosophy and rhetoric, with a view to making the schools the\r\nresort of students from all parts of the empire. Along with his son\r\nCommodus he entered Rome in 176, and obtained a triumph for victories in\r\nGermany. In 177 occurred that persecution of Christians, the share of\r\nAurelius in which has been the subject of so much controversy. Meanwhile\r\nthe German War continued, and the two Quintilii, who had been left in\r\ncommand, begged Aurelius once more to take the field. In this campaign\r\nAurelius, after a series of successes, was attacked, according to some\r\nauthorities, by an infectious disease, of which he died after a seven\r\ndays' illness, either in his camp at Sirmium (Mitrovitz), on the Save,\r\nin Lower Pannonia, or at Vindobona (Vienna), on the 17th of March 180,\r\nin the fifty-ninth year of his age. Other accounts are: (1) that he was\r\npoisoned in the interests of Commodus (Dio. Cass. lxxi. 33, 4), (2) that\r\nhe died of a chronic stomachic disease; the latter is perhaps the most\r\nlikely. His ashes (according to some authorities, his body) were taken\r\nto Rome. By common consent he was deified and all those who could afford\r\nthe cost obtained his statue or bust; for a long time his statues held a\r\nplace among the penates of the Romans. Commodus, who was with his father\r\nwhen he died, erected to his memory the Antonine column (now in the\r\nPiazza Colonna at Rome), round the shaft of which are sculptures in\r\nrelief commemorating the miracle of the Thundering Legion and the\r\nvarious victories of Aurelius over the Quadi and the Marcomanni. A\r\nbronze equestrian statue was set up in the Forum, now on the Capitol.\r\n\r\nAurelius throughout his reign was hostile to Christianity. The\r\nChristians suffered from systematic persecution, and many historians,\r\nwith a strange lack of historical insight, have poured denunciation upon\r\nhim for an attitude which was the natural outcome of his convictions.\r\nDuring his reign the atmosphere of Roman society was heavily charged\r\nwith the popular Greek philosophy to which, ethics apart, Christianity\r\nwas diametrically opposed. Under Antoninus the \"pursuit\" of Christians\r\nwas unknown; under Trajan and Hadrian it was forbidden (cf. Keim, _Aus\r\ndem Urchrist_, p. 99). But Aurelius was an eager patriot and a man of\r\nlogical mind. From his earliest youth he had learned to identify the\r\nritual of the Roman religion with the very essence of the imperial idea.\r\nHe became a Salian priest at the age of eight, and soon knew by heart\r\nall the forms and liturgical order of the official worship, and even the\r\nsacred music. In the earliest statue we have he is a youth offering\r\nincense; he is a priest at the sacrificial altar in the latest triumphal\r\nreliefs. Naturally he felt that the prevalence of Christianity was\r\nincompatible with his ideal of Roman prosperity, and therefore that the\r\npolicy of the Flavian emperors was the only logical solution of an\r\nimportant problem. Neumann argued that the recrudescence of active\r\npersecution was initiated by a deliberate ad hoc rescript issued\r\nprobably in A.D. 176. Sir W. M. Ramsay, however, doubts this (_The\r\nChurch in the Roman Empire_, London, 1893), and argues that it was due\r\nto a long series of instructions to provincial governors (_mandata_, not\r\n_decreta_) who interpreted their duty largely in conformity with the\r\nattitude of the reigning emperor. In other words the governors were\r\nordered merely to punish sacrilege, and, under Aurelius, Christianity\r\nwas regarded as such. In the second place, though it is true that the\r\npersecutions indicated by Celsus (Origen, _Celsus_, viii. 69), Justin,\r\nMelito (in Eusebius, _H.E._, iv. 26), Athenagoras (_Libellus pro\r\nChristianis_) and the _Acts of Martyrs_, were greatly in excess of those\r\nrecorded in previous reigns, it must not be forgotten that it was only\r\nin this period that the Christians began to keep records. Thirdly, there\r\ncan be no doubt that the Christians had recently assumed a much bolder\r\nattitude, and thus segregated themselves from the mass of those\r\nunorthodox sects which the Roman could afford to despise. Like the\r\nDruids in Gaul (cf. T. Mommsen, _Prov. Rom. Emp._, Eng. trans. i. 105,\r\nand V. Duruy, _Rev. archéol._, Apr. 1880), the Christians were\r\nparticularly dangerous, inasmuch as they taught a unity which\r\ntranscended that of the Roman Empire, and must, therefore, have been\r\nregarded as antagonistic to the existing political and social organism.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we remember that Aurelius knew little of the\r\nChristians, that the only mention of them in the _Meditations_ is a\r\ncontemptuous reference to certain fanatics of their number whom even\r\nClement of Alexandria compares for their thirst for martyrdom to the\r\nIndian gymnosophists, and finally that the least worthy of them were\r\ndoubtless the most prominent, we cannot doubt that Aurelius was acting\r\nunquestionably in the best interests of a perfectly intelligible ideal.\r\nHe was \"Roman in resolution and repression, Roman in civic nobility and\r\npride, Roman in tenacity of imperial aim, Roman in respect for law,\r\nRoman in self-effacement for the service of the State\" (G. H. Rendall).\r\n\r\n  _Philosophy._--The book which contains the philosophy of Aurelius is\r\n  known by the title of his _Reflections_, or _Meditations_, although\r\n  that is not the name which he gave to it himself ([Greek: Tà eis\r\n  heauton]). Of the genuineness of the work no doubts are now\r\n  entertained. It is believed that he wrote also an autobiography, which\r\n  has perished. The _Meditations_ were written, it is evident, as\r\n  occasion offered--in the midst of public business, and on the eve of\r\n  battles on which the fate of the empire depended--hence their\r\n  fragmentary appearance, but hence also much of their practical value\r\n  and even of their charm. It is believed by many critics that they were\r\n  intended for the guidance of Aurelius's son, Commodus (q.v.); at all\r\n  events they are generally considered as one of the most precious of\r\n  the legacies of antiquity. Renan even called them \"the most human of\r\n  all books,\" and they are described by J. S. Mill in his _Utility of\r\n  Religion_ as almost equal in ethical elevation to the Sermon on the\r\n  Mount.\r\n\r\n  Aurelius throughout his life adhered to the Stoical philosophy. But,\r\n  as Tenneman says, he imparted to it \"a character of gentleness and\r\n  benevolence, by making it subordinate to a love of mankind, allied to\r\n  religion.\" His thoughts represent a transitional movement, and it is\r\n  difficult to discover in them anything like a systematic philosophy.\r\n  From the manner, however, in which he seeks to distinguish between\r\n  matter and cause or reason, and from the earnestness with which he\r\n  advises men to examine all the impressions on their minds, it may be\r\n  inferred that he held the view of Anaxagoras--that God and matter\r\n  exist independently, but that God governs matter. There can be no\r\n  doubt that Aurelius believed in a deity, although Schultz is probably\r\n  right in maintaining that all his theology amounts to this--the soul\r\n  of man is most intimately united to his body, and together they make\r\n  one animal which we call man; and so the deity is most intimately\r\n  united to the world or the material universe, and together they form\r\n  one whole. We find in the _Meditations_ no speculations on the\r\n  absolute nature of the deity, and no clear expressions of opinion as\r\n  to a future state. We may also observe here that, like Epictetus, he\r\n  is by no means so decided on the subject of suicide as the older\r\n  Stoics. Aurelius is, above all things, a practical moralist. The goal\r\n  in life to be aimed at, according to him, is not happiness, but\r\n  tranquillity, or equanimity. This condition of mind can be obtained\r\n  only by \"living conformably to nature,\" that is to say, one's whole\r\n  nature, and as a means to that man must cultivate the four chief\r\n  virtues, each of which has its distinct sphere--wisdom, or the\r\n  knowledge of good and evil; justice, or the giving to every man his\r\n  due; fortitude, or the enduring of labour and pain; and temperance, or\r\n  moderation in all things. It is no \"fugitive and cloistered virtue\"\r\n  that Aurelius seeks to encourage; on the contrary, man must lead the\r\n  \"life of the social animal,\" must \"live as on a mountain\"; and \"he is\r\n  an abscess on the universe who withdraws and separates himself from\r\n  the reason of our common nature through being displeased with the\r\n  things which happen.\" While the prime principle in man is the social,\r\n  \"the next in order is not to yield to the persuasions of the body,\r\n  when they are not conformable to the rational principle which must\r\n  govern.\" This divinity \"within a man,\" this \"legislating faculty,\"\r\n  which, looked at from one point of view, is conscience, and from\r\n  another is reason, must be implicitly obeyed. He who thus obeys it\r\n  will attain tranquillity of mind; nothing can irritate him, for\r\n  everything is according to nature, and death itself \"is such as\r\n  generation is, a mystery of nature, a composition out of the same\r\n  elements, and a decomposition into the same, and altogether not a\r\n  thing of which any man should be ashamed, for it is not contrary to\r\n  the nature of a reasonable animal, and not contrary to the reason of\r\n  our constitution.\"\r\n\r\n  The morality of Marcus Aurelius cannot be said to have been new when\r\n  it was given to the world. Its charm lies in its exquisite accent and\r\n  its infinite tenderness. But above all, what gives the sentences of\r\n  Marcus Aurelius their enduring value and fascination, and renders them\r\n  superior to the utterances of Epictetus and Seneca, is that they are\r\n  the gospel of his life. His precepts are simply the records of his\r\n  practice. To the saintliness of the cloister he added the wisdom of\r\n  the man of the world; he was constant in misfortune, not elated by\r\n  prosperity, never \"carrying things to the sweating-point,\" but\r\n  preserving, in a time of universal corruption, unreality and\r\n  self-indulgence, a nature sweet, pure, self-denying, unaffected.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--P.

M.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Capitolinus states that he was originally called Catilius Severus\r\n    after his mother's grandfather; if so the name was early discarded.\r\n\r\n  [2] Aurelius has been severely criticized for sending Verus. Among\r\n    various reasons, the most convincing is that the presence of Aurelius\r\n    was required in Rome; moreover, the real leader was evidently\r\n    Cassius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCY, WILLIAM LEARNED (1786-1857), American statesman, was born in\r\nSouthbridge (then part of Sturbridge), Massachusetts, on the 12th of\r\nDecember 1786. He graduated at Brown University in 1808, studied law,\r\nwas admitted to the bar in Troy, New York, and began practice there in\r\n1810. During the War of 1812 he served first as a lieutenant and\r\nafterwards as a captain of volunteers, and on the 22nd of October 1812\r\ntook part in the storming of the British post at St Regis, Canada. In\r\n1816 he became recorder of Troy, but as he sided with the Anti-Clinton\r\nfaction of the Democratic-Republican Party, known as the \"Bucktails,\" he\r\nwas removed from office in 1818 by his political opponents. As editor of\r\nthe Troy _Budget_ (daily) he was a vigorous supporter of Martin Van\r\nBuren, and when Van Buren's followers acquired control of the\r\nlegislature in 1821 Marcy was made adjutant-general of the New York\r\nmilitia. From 1823 to 1829 Marcy was comptroller of the state, an office\r\nthen especially important on account of the large expenditures for\r\ninternal improvements, and during this period he became the leading\r\nmember of the famous \"Albany Regency,\" a group of able Democratic\r\npoliticians who exerted a powerful influence throughout the state by\r\ntheir control of the party patronage and machinery. He was one of the\r\nassociate justices of the New York Supreme Court from 1829 to 1831,\r\npresiding over the trial of the alleged murderers of William Morgan and\r\nin other important cases; and was a member of the United States Senate\r\nfrom December 1831 to July 1832, when he resigned to become governor of\r\nNew York. In a speech in the Senate defending Van Buren against an\r\nattack by Henry Clay, Marcy made the unfortunate remark that \"to the\r\nvictors belong the spoils of the enemy,\" and thereby became widely known\r\nas a champion of the proscription of political opponents. He served as\r\ngovernor of New York for six years (Jan. 1, 1833 to Dec. 31, 1838), but\r\nwas defeated in 1838 by the Whig candidate, William H. Seward. As\r\ngovernor he checked the issue of bank charters by the legislature and\r\nsecured the enactment, in 1838, of a general banking law, which\r\nabolished the monopoly features incident to the old banking system. In\r\n1839-1842 Marcy was a member of a commission appointed by President Van\r\nBuren, in accordance with the treaty of 1839 between the United States\r\nand Mexico to \"examine and decide upon\" certain claims of citizens of\r\nthe United States against Mexico. In 1843 he presided over the\r\nDemocratic state convention at Syracuse, and in 1844-1845 he was\r\nrecognized as one of the leaders of the \"Hunkers,\" or regular Democrats\r\nin New York, and an active opponent of the \"Barnburners.\" He was\r\nsecretary of war under President Polk from 1845 to 1849, and as such,\r\ndischarged with ability the especially onerous duties incident to the\r\nconduct of the Mexican War; he became involved, however, in\r\ncontroversies with Generals Scott and Taylor, who accused him, it seems\r\nvery unjustly, of seeking to embarrass their operations in the field\r\nbecause they were political opponents of the administration. In the\r\nDemocratic convention at Baltimore, in 1852, Marcy was a prominent\r\ncandidate for the presidential nomination, and from 1853 to 1857 he was\r\nsecretary of state in the cabinet of President Pierce. Few cabinet\r\nofficers in time of peace have had more engrossing duties. His circular\r\nof the 1st of June 1853 to American diplomatic agents abroad,\r\nrecommending that, whenever practicable, they should \"appear in the\r\nsimple dress of an American citizen,\" created much discussion in Europe;\r\nin 1867 his recommendation was enacted into a law of Congress. One of\r\nthe most important matters with which he was called upon to deal was the\r\n\"Koszta Affair\";[1] his \"Hülsemann letter\" (1853), is an important\r\nstate paper, and the principles it enunciates have been approved by\r\nleading authorities on international law. In the same year he secured\r\nthe negotiation of the Gadsden Treaty (see GADSDEN, JAMES), by which the\r\nboundary dispute between Mexico and the United States was adjusted and a\r\nlarge area was added to the Federal domain; and in June 1854 he\r\nconcluded with Lord Elgin, governor-general of Canada, acting for the\r\nBritish Government, a treaty designed to settle the fisheries question\r\nand providing for tariff reciprocity (as regards certain enumerated\r\ncommodities) between Canada and the United States. In 1854 Marcy had to\r\ndeal with the complications growing out of the bombardment of San Juan\r\ndel Norte (Greytown), Nicaragua, by the United States sloop-of-war\r\n\"Cyane\" for insults offered the American minister by its inhabitants and\r\nfor their refusal to make restitution for damages to American property.\r\nThe expedition of William Walker (q.v.) to Nicaragua in 1855 further\r\ncomplicated the Central American question. The Crimean War, on account\r\nof the extensive recruiting therefor by British consuls in several\r\nAmerican cities, in violation of American neutrality, led to a\r\ndiplomatic controversy with Great Britain, and in May 1856 the British\r\nminister, John F. T. Crampton (1805-1886), received his passports, and\r\nthe exequaturs of the British consuls at New York, Philadelphia and\r\nCincinnati were revoked. The incident created great excitement in\r\nEngland, but in 1857 the British government sent Sir Francis Napier to\r\nWashington to take Crampton's place. To the Declaration of Paris of\r\n1856, prescribing certain rules of naval warfare, Marcy on behalf of his\r\ngovernment refused to subscribe, because Great Britain had rejected his\r\nproposed amendment exempting from seizure in time of war all private\r\nproperty not contraband. The diplomatic relations of the United States\r\nand Spain furnished, perhaps, the most perplexing of Marcy's problems.\r\nUpon the seizure (on Feb. 28, 1854) of the American vessel \"Black\r\nWarrior,\" the confiscation of her cargo, and the fining of her captain\r\nby the Cuban authorities, on the ground that this vessel had violated\r\nthe customs regulations of the port of Havana, slavery propagandists\r\nsought to force the administration into an attitude that would lead to\r\nwar with Spain and make possible the seizure of Cuba; and it was largely\r\ndue to Marcy's influence that war was averted, Spain restoring the\r\nconfiscated cargo and remitting the captain's fine.[2] The secretary,\r\nhowever, was not averse to increasing his popularity and his chances for\r\nthe presidency by obtaining Cuba in an honourable manner, and it was at\r\nhis suggestion that James Buchanan, J. Y. Mason and Pierre Soulé, the\r\nministers respectively to Great Britain, France and Spain, met at Ostend\r\nand Aix-la-Chapelle in October 1854 to discuss the Cuban question. But\r\nthe remarkable \"Ostend Manifesto\" (see BUCHANAN, JAMES), the outcome of\r\ntheir conference, was quite unexpected, and Marcy promptly disavowed the\r\ndocument. Marcy died at Ballston Spa, New York, on the 4th of July 1857,\r\na short time after the close of Pierce's administration. In domestic\r\naffairs Marcy was a shrewd, but honest partisan; in diplomacy he\r\nexhibited the qualities of a broad-minded, patriotic statesman, endowed,\r\nhowever, with vigour, rather than brilliancy, of intellect.\r\n\r\n  For his early career, consult J. S. Jenkins, _Lives of the Governors\r\n  of New York_ (Auburn, New York, 1851), and for his work as secretary\r\n  of state, see James Ford Rhodes, _History of the United States_ (vols.\r\n  i. and ii., New York, 1892), and an article by Sidney Webster, \"Mr\r\n  Marcy, the Cuban Question, and the Ostend Manifesto,\" in vol. viii. of\r\n  the _Political Science Quarterly_ (New York, 1893).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] The \"Koszta Affair\" involved an interesting question of\r\n    international law--i.e. the right of an alien domiciled in any\r\n    country to the protection of that country--and has served as a\r\n    precedent for the American government in somewhat similar cases that\r\n    have arisen. Martin Koszta, a Hungarian revolutionist of 1848, had\r\n    emigrated to the United States and had there taken the preliminary\r\n    step for naturalization by formally declaring his intention to become\r\n    a citizen of the United States. In 1853 he went on personal business\r\n    to Smyrna, where he secured a passport from the American consul; the\r\n    Austrian consul, however, caused him to be seized and detained on an\r\n    Austrian brig-of-war. Soon afterward Captain Duncan N. Ingraham\r\n    (1802-1891), in command of a United States sloop-of-war, arrived at\r\n    Smyrna, and threatened to attack the Austrian vessel unless Koszta\r\n    were released; and as a compromise Koszta was placed in the custody\r\n    of the French consul. To Chevalier Hülsemann, then representing\r\n    Austria at Washington, who had demanded from the United States the\r\n    disavowal of the acts of its agents, the complete surrender of\r\n    Koszta, and \"satisfaction proportionate to the magnitude of the\r\n    outrage,\" Marcy wrote on the 26th of September 1853, that Koszta\r\n    \"when seized and imprisoned was invested with the nationality of the\r\n    United States\" and had a right to the protection of the United States\r\n    government, and added: \"Whenever by the law of nations an individual\r\n    becomes clothed with our national character--he can claim the\r\n    protection of this government, and it may respond to that claim\r\n    without being obliged to explain its conduct to any foreign power;\r\n    for it is its duty to make its nationality respected by other nations\r\n    and respectable in every quarter of the globe.\" Eventually Koszta was\r\n    released and returned to the United States. The Hülsemann letter was\r\n    published and greatly increased Marcy's popularity.\r\n\r\n  [2] See Henry L. James, \"The Black Warrior Affair\" in the _American\r\n    Historical Review_, vol. xii. (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARDIN, the chief town of a sanjak of the Diarbekr vilayet of Asiatic\r\nTurkey. It is a military station on the Diarbekr-Mosul road. It occupies\r\na remarkable site on the south side of a conical hill of soft limestone,\r\nand the houses rise tier above tier. The streets are narrow and paved\r\nin steps, while often the roadway runs along the roof of the house in\r\nthe tier below. The hill is almost surrounded by old walls, while on the\r\nsummit are the remains of the famous castle of the Kaleh Shubha (Lat.\r\n_Maride_ or _Marde_,) which from Roman times has played an important\r\npart in history. The Arab geographers considered it impregnable, and\r\nfrom its steep approaches and well-arranged defences it was able to\r\noffer a protracted resistance to the Mongolian conqueror Hulagu and to\r\nthe armies of Timur. It was also for several centuries the residence of\r\nmore or less independent princes of the Ortokid Turkoman dynasty. The\r\nclimate is healthy and dry, and fruit grows well, but water is sometimes\r\nscanty in the summer. Mardin is the centre of a good corn-growing\r\ndistrict, and is important chiefly as a border town for the Kurds on the\r\nnorth and the Arab tribes to the south. It is the chief centre of the\r\nJacobite Christians, who have many villages in the Tor Abdin hills to\r\nthe north-east, and whose patriarch lives at Deir Zaferan, a Syrian\r\nmonastery of the 9th century not far off in the same direction. The\r\npopulation is estimated at 27,000, of whom about one-half are Christians\r\nof the Armenian, Chaldean, Jacobite, Protestant and Roman Catholic\r\ncommunities. Besides many mosques and churches there are three\r\nmonasteries (Syrian, Franciscan and Capuchin), and an important American\r\nMission station, with church, schools and a medical officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARDUK (Bibl. MERODACH[1]), the name of the patron deity of the city of\r\nBabylon, who, when Babylon permanently became the political centre of\r\nthe united states of the Euphrates valley under Khammurabi (c. 2250\r\nB.C.), rose to the position of the head of the Babylonian pantheon. His\r\noriginal character was that of a solar deity, and he personifies more\r\nspecifically the sun of the spring-time who conquers the storms of the\r\nwinter season. He was thus fitted to become the god who triumphs over\r\nchaos that reigned in the beginning of time. This earlier Marduk,\r\nhowever, was effaced by the reflex of the political development through\r\nwhich the Euphrates valley passed and which led to imbuing him with\r\ntraits belonging to gods who at an earlier period were recognized as the\r\nheads of the pantheon. There are more particularly two gods--Ea and\r\nBel--whose powers and attributes pass over to Marduk. In the case of Ea\r\nthe transfer proceeds pacifically and without involving the effacement\r\nof the older god. Marduk is viewed as the son of Ea. The father\r\nvoluntarily recognizes the superiority of the son and hands over to him\r\nthe control of humanity. This association of Marduk and Ea, while\r\nindicating primarily the passing of the supremacy once enjoyed by Eridu\r\nto Babylon as a religious and political centre, may also reflect an\r\nearly dependence of Babylon upon Eridu, not necessarily of a political\r\ncharacter but, in view of the spread of culture in the Euphrates valley\r\nfrom the south to the north, the recognition of Eridu as the older\r\ncentre on the part of the younger one. At all events, traces of a cult\r\nof Marduk at Eridu are to be noted in the religious literature, and the\r\nmost reasonable explanation for the existence of a god Marduk in Eridu\r\nis to assume that Babylon in this way paid its homage to the old\r\nsettlement at the head of the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nWhile the relationship between Ea (q.v.) and Marduk is thus marked by\r\nharmony and an amicable abdication on the part of the father in favour\r\nof his son, Marduk's absorption of the power and prerogatives of Bel of\r\nNippur was at the expense of the latter's prestige. After the days of\r\nKhammurabi, the cult of Marduk eclipses that of Bel (q.v.), and although\r\nduring the five centuries of Cassite control in Babylonia (c. 1750-1200\r\nB.C.), Nippur and the cult of the older Bel enjoy a period of\r\nrenaissance, when the reaction ensued it marked the definite and\r\npermanent triumph of Marduk over Bel until the end of the Babylonian\r\nempire. The only serious rival to Marduk after 1200 B.C. is Assur (q.v.)\r\nin Assyria. In the south Marduk reigns supreme, and his supremacy is\r\nindicated most significantly by making him the _Bel_, \"the lord,\" _par\r\nexcellence_.\r\n\r\nThe old myths in which Bel of Nippur was celebrated as the hero were\r\ntransformed by the priests of Babylon in the interest of the Marduk\r\ncult with the chief rôle assigned to their favourite. The hymns once\r\nsung in the temple of Bel were re-edited and adapted to the cult of\r\nBabylon. In this process the older Bel was deliberately set aside, and\r\nthe climax was reached when the conquest of the monster Tiamat,\r\nsymbolizing the chaos prevailing in primeval days, was ascribed to\r\nMarduk instead of, as in the older form of the epic, to Bel. With this\r\nstroke Marduk became the creator of the world, including mankind--again\r\nsetting aside the far older claims of Bel to this distinction.\r\n\r\nBesides absorbing the prerogatives of Ea and Bel, Marduk was also imbued\r\nwith the attributes of other of the great gods, such as Adad, Shamash,\r\nNergal and Ninib, so that, more particularly as we approach the days of\r\nthe Neo-Babylonian Empire, the impression is created that Marduk was the\r\nonly real deity recognized, and that the other gods were merely the\r\nvarious forms under which he manifested himself. So far as one can speak\r\nof a monotheistic tendency in Babylonia it connects itself with this\r\nconception that was gradually crystallized in regard to the old solar\r\ndeity of Babylon.\r\n\r\nThe history of the city of Babylon can now be traced back to the days of\r\nSargon of Agade (before 3000 B.C.) who appears to have given the city\r\nits name. There is every reason to assume, therefore, that the cult of\r\nMarduk existed already at this early period, though it must always be\r\nborne in mind that, until the days of Khammurabi, his jurisdiction was\r\nlimited to the city of which he was the patron and that he was viewed\r\nsolely as a solar deity.\r\n\r\nOn monuments and cylinders he is represented as armed with the weapon\r\nwith which he despatched the monster Tiamat. At times this monster is\r\nalso depicted lying vanquished at his feet, and occasionally the monster\r\nwith the lance or the lance alone is reproduced instead of the god\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the astral-theological system, Marduk is identified with the planet\r\nJupiter. As the creator of the world, the New Year's festival, known as\r\nZagmuk and celebrated at the time of the vernal equinox, was sacred to\r\nhim. The festival, which lasted for eleven days, symbolized the new\r\nbirth of nature--a reproduction therefore of the creation of the world.\r\nThe arbiter of all fates, Marduk, was pictured as holding an assembly of\r\nthe gods during the New Year's festival for the purpose of deciding the\r\nlot of each individual for the year to come. The epic reciting his\r\nwonderful deed in despatching the monster Tiamat and in establishing law\r\nand order in the world in the place of chaos was recited in his temple\r\nat Babylon known as E-Saggila, \"the lofty house,\" and there are some\r\nreasons for believing that the recital was accompanied by a dramatical\r\nrepresentation of the epic.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the name Marduk is unknown. By a species of word-play the\r\nname was interpreted as \"the son of the chamber,\" with reference perhaps\r\nto the sacred chamber of fate in which he sat in judgment on the New\r\nYear's festival. Ideographically he is represented by two signs\r\nsignifying \"child of the day\" (or \"of the sun\") which is a distinct\r\nallusion to his original solar character. Other ideographic signs\r\ndescribe him as the \"strong and universal ruler.\" The name of his\r\nconsort was Sarpanit, i.e. the shining or brilliant one--again an\r\nallusion to Marduk's solar traits--and this name was playfully twisted\r\nby the Babylonian priests to mean \"the seed-producing\" (as though\r\ncompounded of _zer_, seed, and _banit_, producing), which was regarded\r\nas an appropriate appellation for the female counterpart of the creator\r\nof mankind and of life in general. The punning etymology betrays the\r\nevident desire of the priests to see in Marduk's consort a form or\r\nmanifestation of the great mother-goddess Ishtar (q.v.), just as in\r\nAssyria Ishtar frequently appears as the consort of the chief god of\r\nAssyria, known as Assur (q.v.).     (M. JA.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] The name Mordecai denotes \"belonging to Marduk.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARE, the English term for the female of any animal of the family\r\n_Equidae_, of the ass, or zebra, but particularly of the horse. It is\r\nalso used of the camel. To find a \"mare's nest\" is an old proverbial\r\nsaying for a purely imaginary discovery. In \"night-mare,\" an oppressive\r\nor terrifying dream, the termination is a word appearing as _mar_,\r\n_maer_ and _mara_ in various Teutonic languages for a goblin, supposed\r\nto sit on a sleeper's chest and cause these dreams: cf. elf. This\r\nTeutonic word also appears in the French _cauchemar_, the first part\r\nbeing from _caucher_, to tread or trample upon, Lat. _calcare_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARE CLAUSUM and MARE LIBERUM (Lat. for \"closed sea\" and \"free sea\"), in\r\ninternational law, terms associated with the historic controversy which\r\narose out of demands on the part of different states to assert exclusive\r\ndominion over areas of the open or high sea. Thus Spain laid claim to\r\nexclusive dominion over whole oceans, Great Britain to all her\r\nenvironing narrow seas and so on. These claims gave rise to vigorous\r\nopposition by other powers and led to the publication of Grotius's work\r\n(1609) called _Mare liberum_. In _Mare clausum_ (1635) John Selden\r\nendeavoured to prove that the sea was practically as capable of\r\nappropriation as territory. Owing to the conflict of claims which grew\r\nout of the controversy, maritime states had to moderate their demands\r\nand base their pretensions to maritime dominion on the principle that it\r\nextended seawards from land.\r\n\r\nA formula was found by Bynkershoek in his _De dominio maris_ (1702) for\r\nthe restriction of dominion over the sea to the actual distance to which\r\ncannon range could protect it. This became universally adopted and\r\ndeveloped into the three-mile belt (see TERRITORIAL WATERS). In recent\r\ntimes controversies have arisen in connexion with the Baltic, the Black\r\nSea and more especially the Bering Sea. In the latter case the United\r\nStates, after the purchase of Alaska, vainly attempted to assert\r\ndominion beyond the three-mile limit. Still more recently the hardship\r\nof treating the greater part of Moray Firth as open sea to the exclusion\r\nof British and to the advantage of foreign fishermen has been raised\r\n(see NORTH SEA FISHERIES CONVENTION; TERRITORIAL WATERS).\r\n\r\nConventions for the suppression of the slave trade, including the\r\nBrussels General Act of 1885, and the North Sea Fisheries Convention,\r\nhave placed restrictions on the freedom of the high sea, and possibly,\r\nin the general interest, other agreements will bring it further under\r\ncontrol, on the principle that what is the property of all nations must\r\nbe used without detriment to its use by others (see HIGH SEAS).\r\n     (T. Ba.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAREE, LOCH, a fresh-water lake in the county of Ross and Cromarty,\r\nScotland. Its name--of which Maroy and Mourie are older variants--does\r\nnot, as is often supposed, commemorate the Virgin, but St Maelrubha, who\r\ncame from Bangor in Ireland in 671 and founded a monastery at Applecross\r\nand a chapel (now in ruins) on Isle Maree. Trending in a south-easterly\r\nto north-westerly direction, the lake has a length of 13½ m. from\r\nKinlochewe at the head of the dam erected in the 16th century (or\r\nearlier) by the iron-smelters of the Cheardach Ruardh, or Red Smiddy, on\r\nthe short but impetuous river Ewe by which it drains to the sea. It lies\r\nat a height of 32 ft. above sea-level; the greatest breadth is just over\r\n2 m. at Slattadale, the mean breadth being 9/10 of a mile; and the\r\ngreatest depth, 367 ft., occurs in the upper basin, the mean depth being\r\n125 ft. Its waters cover an area of fully 11 sq. m., and its islands\r\nnearly 1 sq. m., while the drainage area is 171 sq. m. A remarkable\r\nfeature is the large number (more than 30) and considerable area of the\r\nislands. Excepting Loch Cròcach, a small lake in the Assynt district of\r\nSutherlandshire, its insularity (i.e. the ratio of the total area of the\r\nislands to that of the water surface) is higher than that of any other\r\nlake in Great Britain, Loch Lomond coming next. Nearly all the islands\r\nlie north and east of Slattadale, the largest being Eilean Subhainn, or\r\nSt Swithin's Isle, which contains a small lake 750 ft. long, 300 ft.\r\nbroad and 64 ft. deep. For two-thirds of its length the loch is flanked\r\nby magnificent mountains. On the north-east the principal heights are\r\nBen Slioch (3217 ft.), whose sugar-loaf form dominates the landscape,\r\nBen Lair (2817) and Ben Airidh-a-Char (2593), and, on the south-west,\r\nthe peaks of Ben Eay, four of which exceed 3000 ft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAREMMA (a corruption of _Marittima_, \"situated on the sea\"), a marshy\r\nregion of Tuscany, Italy, extending from the mouth of the Cecina to\r\nOrbetello and varying in breadth from 15 to 20 m. In Etruscan and Roman\r\ntimes the Maremma was a populous and fertile coast plain, with\r\nconsiderable towns situated on the hills--Populonia, Russellae, Cosa,\r\n&c., and was drained by a complete system of subterranean canals which\r\nwere brought to light by the excavations made in connexion with the\r\nrailways passing through the district. But the decline of agriculture at\r\nthe end of the Republic led to a conversion of the land to pasture, and\r\nlater the unsettled state of affairs consequent on the fall of the Roman\r\nEmpire resulted in neglect of the watercourses. Leopold II. of Tuscany\r\n(1822-1844) made the first successful efforts to counteract the malaria\r\nwhich has affected the district, by drainage, the filling up of swamps,\r\nand the establishment of new farms, and since his time continuous\r\nefforts have been made with considerable success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARENGO, a village of north Italy, on the road between Alessandria and\r\nTortona, and 4¾ m. E.S.E. of the gates of the former. It is situated on\r\nthe Fontanone brook, a small affluent of the Tanaro which marks the\r\nwestern edge of the plain of Marengo, the scene of the great victory won\r\nby Napoleon over the Austrians under Baron Melas (1729-1806) on the 14th\r\nof June 1800. (The antecedents of the battle are described under FRENCH\r\nREVOLUTIONARY WARS).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map.]\r\n\r\nThe French army, in ignorance of its opponent's position, had advanced\r\nwestward from the Scrivia towards Alessandria on the 12th, and its\r\noutposts had reached the Bormida on the evening of the 13th. But contact\r\nwith the main Austrian army was not obtained, and on the assumption that\r\nit was moving towards either Valenza or Genoa Napoleon weakened his army\r\nby considerable detachments sent out right and left to find the enemy\r\nand to delay his progress. Unknown, however, to Napoleon Melas's army\r\nwas still at Alessandria, and on the morning of the 14th of June it\r\nfiled out of the fortress and began its advance into the great plain of\r\nMarengo, one of the few favourable cavalry battle-grounds in north\r\nItaly.\r\n\r\nThe dispersion of the French army allowed only a fragmentary, though\r\nmost energetic, resistance to be offered to the Austrian onset. The\r\nlatter, considerably delayed at first by the crossing of the river\r\nBormida, broke up into two columns,[1] which advanced, the right by the\r\nmain road on Marengo, the left on Castel Ceriolo. The former, personally\r\ncommanded by Melas, was 20,000 strong, and General Victor, its immediate\r\nopponent, about 10,000, or including some 5000 of Lannes' corps who\r\nfought on his right, about 15,000 strong; the Austrians were, moreover,\r\ngreatly superior in guns and cavalry. The French disputed every yard of\r\nground, holding their first line until they had by fire and\r\ncounter-attack forced practically the whole of the Austrian right to\r\ndeploy, and two hours passed before the Austrians managed to reach the\r\nFontanone brook. But Victor's troops, being disorganized and short of\r\nammunition, had then to retire more rapidly across the plain. The\r\nretreat was orderly, according to Victor's report, and made in échelon\r\nfrom the centre, and it is certain that at any rate the regiments held\r\ntogether, for the 6000 Austrian sabres found no opportunity to charge\r\nhome. Many guns and wagons were, however, abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the French right, opposed to the column of Lieut.-Field-Marshal Ott,\r\nwas Lannes, with some 4000 men (excluding Watrin's division which was\r\nwith Victor) against 7500. He too was after a time forced to retire,\r\nwith heavy losses. Thus, about 11 a.m. the First Consul, who was at some\r\ndistance from the field, was at last convinced that he had to deal with\r\nMelas's army. At once he sent out his staff officers to bring back his\r\ndetachments, and pushed forward his only reserve, Monnier's division, to\r\nsupport Lannes and Victor. But before this help arrived Lannes had been\r\ndriven out of Castel Ceriolo, and Victor and Watrin forced back almost\r\nto San Giuliano. A little after 2 p.m. Monnier's division (3500) came\r\ninto action, and its impetuous advance drove the Austrians out of Castel\r\nCeriolo. But after an hour it was forced back in its turn, and by 3 p.m.\r\ntherefore, the 20,000 French troops, disordered and exhausted, and in\r\none line without reserves,[2] held a ragged line of battle to the right\r\nand left of San Giuliano. The best that could be expected was a\r\nprolongation of the struggle till nightfall and a fairly orderly\r\nretreat. The Austrian general, believing that the battle was won,\r\nreturned to Alessandria, leaving a younger man, his chief of staff Zach,\r\nto organize the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThen followed one of the most dramatic events in military history. Of\r\nthe two detachments sent away by Napoleon in search of the enemy, one\r\nonly received its orders of recall. This was Boudet's division of\r\nDesaix's corps, away to the south at Rivalta and at noon heading for\r\nPozzolo-Formigaro on the Alessandria-Genoa road. At 1 p.m. a brief\r\nmessage, \"Revenez, au nom de Díeu!\" altered the direction of the column,\r\nand between 4 and 5, after a forced march, the division, headed by\r\nDesaix, came on to the battle-field. It was deployed as a unit and moved\r\nforward at the word of command along the main road Alessandria-Tortona,\r\nthe sight of their closed line giving fresh courage to the men of Lannes\r\nand Victor. Then, while on the other side Zach was arraying a deep\r\ncolumn of troops to pursue along the main road, Napoleon and Desaix,\r\nthemselves under fire, hastily framed a plan of attack. All arms were\r\ncombined. First, Marmont with eight of Boudet's guns and ten others (the\r\nrest had been abandoned in the retirement) came into action on the right\r\nof the road, replying to the fire of the Austrian guns and checking\r\ntheir advanced infantry; close in rear of the artillery was Desaix's\r\ninfantry with the remnants of Lannes' and Victor's troops rallying on\r\nits right and left; on Lannes' right, still facing Ott's column, was\r\nMonnier, supported by the Consular Guard of horse and foot; lastly 400\r\nsabres of Kellermann's cavalry brigade, which had already been engaged\r\nseveral times and had lost heavily, formed up on the right of Desaix.\r\nAbout 5 p.m. Desaix advanced against the head of the Austrian main\r\ncolumn formed by Zach. He himself fell in the attack, but the onset of\r\nhis intact troops drove back the leading Austrians upon their supports,\r\nand at the critical moment when the attack of Boudet's single weak\r\ndivision had almost spent its force, Kellermann with his 400 sabres\r\nsallied out of the French line. Marmont had brought up two guns to\r\nassist the infantry, and as he fired his last round of case-shot the\r\ncavalry raced past him to the front, wheeled inwards against the flank\r\nof the great column, and rode through and through it. Zach was taken\r\nprisoner with more than 2000 men, and Kellermann, rallying some of his\r\ntroopers, flung himself upon the astonished Austrian cavalry and with\r\nthe assistance of the Consular Guard cavalry defeated it. The \"will to\r\nconquer\" spread along the whole French line, while the surprise of the\r\nAustrians suddenly and strangely became mere panic. Lannes, Victor and\r\nMonnier advanced afresh, pushing the Austrians back on Marengo. A few\r\nAustrian battalions made a gallant stand at that place, while Melas\r\nhimself, as night came on, rallied the fugitives beyond. Next day the\r\ncompletely exhausted, but victorious, French army extorted from the\r\ndazed Austrians a convention by which all Italy up to the Mincio was\r\nevacuated by them. The respective losses were: French about 4000,\r\nAustrians 9500.\r\n\r\n  See the French official _Campagne de l'armée de réserve_, vol. ii., by\r\n  C. de Cugnac.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] A third column was sent out to the extreme right (3000 under\r\n    O'Reilly). This destroyed a small French detachment on the extreme\r\n    left, but took little or no part in the main battle.\r\n\r\n  [2] The Austrians, too, fighting in \"linear\" formation had few\r\n    reserves. About one-third only of the imperial forces in Italy was\r\n    actually engaged in the battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAREOTIS (Arabic _Mariut_), the most westerly of the lakes in the Delta\r\nof Egypt. On the narrow strip of land separating the lake from the\r\nMediterranean the city of Alexandria is built. (See EGYPT; and\r\nALEXANDRIA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARE'S-TAIL, in botany, the popular name for an aquatic herb known\r\nbotanically as _Hippuris vulgaris_ (natural order Haloragaceae). It\r\ngrows on margins of lakes, ponds and similar localities, and has a\r\nsubmerged stout creeping rootstock from which spring many-jointed\r\ncylindrical stems bearing numerous narrow leaves close-set in whorls.\r\nThe minute greenish flowers are borne in the leaf-axils. Like many\r\nfresh-water plants it has a wide distribution, occurring in arctic and\r\ntemperate regions in the northern hemisphere and reappearing in\r\nantarctic South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARET, HUGUES-BERNARD, DUC DE BASSANO (1763-1839), French statesman and\r\npublicist, was born at Dijon. After receiving a sound education, he\r\nentered the legal profession and became advocate at the King's Council\r\nat Paris. The ideas of the French Revolution profoundly influenced him,\r\nand wholly altered his career. The interest aroused by the debates of\r\nthe first National Assembly suggested to him the idea of publishing\r\nthem, conjointly with Méjean, in the _Bulletin de l'Assemblée_. The\r\npublicist Charles Joseph Panckoucke (1736-1798), owner of the _Mercure\r\nde France_ and publisher of the famous _Encyclopédie_ (1781), persuaded\r\nhim to merge this in a larger paper, the _Moniteur universel_, which\r\ngained a wide repute for correctness and impartiality. He was a member\r\nof the moderate club, the Feuillants; but after the overthrow of the\r\nmonarchy on the 10th of August 1792 he accepted an office in the\r\nministry of foreign affairs, where he sometimes exercised a steadying\r\ninfluence. On the withdrawal of the British legation from Paris Maret\r\nwent on a mission to London, where he had a favourable interview with\r\nPitt on the 2nd of December 1792. All hope of an accommodation was,\r\nhowever, in vain. After the execution of Louis XVI. (Jan. 21, 1793), the\r\nchief French diplomatic agent, Chauvelin, was ordered to leave England,\r\nwhile the French Convention declared war (Feb. 1, 1793). These events\r\nprecluded the possibility of success attending a second mission of Maret\r\nto London in January. After a space, in which he held no diplomatic\r\npost, he became ambassador of the French Republic at Naples; but, while\r\nrepairing thither with De Sémonville he was captured by the Austrians\r\nand was kept in durance by them for some thirty months, until, at the\r\nclose of 1795, the two were set free in return for the liberation of the\r\ndaughter of Louis XVI. For a time Maret betook himself to journalism;\r\nbut he played a useful part in the negotiations for a peace with Great\r\nBritain which went on at Lille during the summer of 1797, until the\r\nvictory of the Jacobins at Paris in the _coup d'état_ of Fructidor\r\n(Sept. 1797) frustrated the hopes of Pitt for peace and inflicted on\r\nMaret another reverse of fortune. On the return of Bonaparte from Egypt\r\nin 1799 Maret joined the general's party which came to power with the\r\n_coup d'état_ of Brumaire (Nov. 9-10, 1799).\r\n\r\nMaret now became one of the First Consul's secretaries and shortly\r\nafterwards secretary of state. In this position his moderation,\r\nindustry, good sense, knowledge of men and of affairs, made his services\r\nof great value. The _Moniteur_, which became the official journal of the\r\nstate in 1800, was placed under his control. He sometimes succeeded in\r\ntoning down the hard, abrupt language of Napoleon's communications, and\r\nin every way proved a useful intermediary. It is known that he had a\r\nshare in the drawing up of the new constitutions for the Batavian and\r\nItalian Republics. In 1804 he became Minister; in 1807 he was named\r\ncount, and in 1809 he received the title of duc de Bassano, an honour\r\nwhich marked the sense entertained by Napoleon of his strenuous toil,\r\nespecially in connexion with the diplomatic negotiations and treaties of\r\nthis period. His personal devotion to the emperor was of that absolute\r\nunwavering kind which Napoleon highly valued; it is seen in the attempt\r\nto defend the unworthy artifices adopted by the great man in April-May\r\n1808 in order to make himself master of the destinies of Spain. Maret\r\nalso assisted in drawing up the constitution destined for Spain, which\r\nthe Spaniards at once rejected.\r\n\r\nMaret accompanied Napoleon through most of his campaigns, including that\r\nof 1809; and at its close he expressed himself in favour of the marriage\r\nalliance with the archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, which took place\r\nin 1810. In the spring of 1811, the duc de Bassano replaced Champagny,\r\nduc de Cadore, as minister of Foreign Affairs. In this capacity he\r\nshowed his usual industry and devotion, concluding the treaties between\r\nFrance and Austria and France and Prussia, which preceded the French\r\ninvasion of Russia in 1812. He was with Napoleon through the greater\r\npart of that campaign; and after its disastrous conclusion helped to\r\nprepare the new forces with which Napoleon waged the equally disastrous\r\ncampaign of 1813. But in November 1813 Napoleon replaced him by\r\nCaulaincourt, duc de Vicence, who was thought to be more devoted to the\r\ncause of peace and personally grateful to the emperor Alexander I. of\r\nRussia. Maret, however, as private secretary of the emperor, remained\r\nwith his master through the campaign of 1814, as also during that of\r\n1815. After the second restoration of the Bourbons he was exiled, and\r\nretired to Grätz where he occupied himself with literary work. In 1820\r\nhe was allowed to return to France, and after the Revolution of 1830,\r\nLouis Philippe, king of the French, made him a peer of France; he also\r\nheld two high offices for a few days. He died at Paris in 1839. He\r\nshares with Daru the honour of being the hardest worker and most devoted\r\nsupporter in Napoleon's service; but it has generally been considered\r\nthat he carried devotion to the length of servility, and thus often\r\ncompromised the real interests of France. This view has been contested\r\nby Baron Ernouf in his work _Maret, duc de Bassano_, which is the best\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\n  For Maret's mission to England in 1792 and his work at Lille in 1797,\r\n  see Augustus W. Miles, _Letters on the French Revolution_; J. H. Rose,\r\n  _The Life and Times of William Pitt_, and for other incidents of\r\n  Maret's career, the memoirs of Bourrienne, Pasquier, Méneval and\r\n  Savary (duc de Rovigo), may be consulted. Thiers's account of Maret is\r\n  in general hostile to him.     (J. Hl. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET (Fr. _Marguerite_, It. _Margherita_, Ger. _Margareta_, and\r\n_Margarete_, with dim. _Grete_, _Gretchen_, _Meta_, fr. Lat.\r\n_margarita_, Gr. [Greek: margaritês], a pearl), a female proper name,\r\nwhich became very popular in all Christian countries as that of the\r\nsaint noticed below. Biographies of some who have borne it are arranged\r\nbelow in the following order: saints, queens of Scotland, queens of\r\nother countries, princesses and duchesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET, ST (SANCTA MARGARITA), virgin and martyr, is celebrated by the\r\nChurch of Rome on the 20th of July. According to the legend, she was a\r\nnative of Antioch, daughter of a pagan priest named Aedesius. She was\r\nscorned by her father for her Christian faith, and lived in the country\r\nwith a foster mother keeping sheep. Olybrius, the \"praeses orientis,\"\r\noffered her marriage as the price of her renunciation of Christianity.\r\nHer refusal led to her being cruelly tortured, and after various\r\nmiraculous incidents, she was put to death. Among the Greeks she is\r\nknown as Marina, and her festival is on the 17th of July. She has been\r\nidentified with St Pelagia (q.v.)--Marina being the Latin equivalent of\r\nPelagia--who, according to a legend, was also called Margarito. We\r\npossess no historical documents on St Margaret as distinct from St\r\nPelagia. An attempt has been made, but without success, to prove that\r\nthe group of legends with which that of St Margaret is connected is\r\nderived from a transformation of the pagan divinity Aphrodite into a\r\nChristian saint. The problem of her identity is a purely literary\r\nquestion. The cult of St Margaret was very widespread in England, where\r\nmore than 250 churches are dedicated to her.\r\n\r\n  See _Acta sanctorum_, July, v. 24-45; _Bibliotheca hagiographica.\r\n  Latina_ (Brussels, 1899), n. 5303-5313; Frances Arnold-Forster,\r\n  _Studies in Church Dedications_ (London, 1899), i. 131-133 and iii.\r\n  19.     (H. De.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET, ST (c. 1045-1093), the queen of Malcolm III. Canmore king of\r\nScotland, was the daughter of the English prince Edward, son of Edmund\r\nIronside, and sister of Edgar Ætheling, and was probably born in\r\nHungary. In 1067 the widow and children of Edward fled from\r\nNorthumberland with a large number of followers and sought the\r\nprotection of the Scottish king. The marriage of Malcolm and Margaret\r\nsoon took place and was followed by several invasions of Northumberland\r\nby the Scottish king, probably in support of the claims of his\r\nbrother-in-law Edgar. These, however, had little result beyond the\r\ndevastation of the province. Far more important were the effects of this\r\nalliance upon the history of Scotland. A considerable portion of the old\r\nNorthumbrian kingdom had been reduced by the Scottish kings in the\r\nprevious century, but up to this time the English population had little\r\ninfluence upon the ruling element of the kingdom. Malcolm's marriage\r\nundoubtedly improved the condition of the English to a great extent, and\r\nunder Margaret's sons, Edgar, Alexander I. and David I., the Scottish\r\ncourt practically became anglicized. Margaret died on the 17th of\r\nNovember 1093, four days after her husband and her eldest son Edward,\r\nwho were slain in an invasion of Northumberland. She rebuilt the\r\nmonastery of Iona, and was canonized in 1251 on account of her great\r\nbenefactions to the Church.\r\n\r\n  See _Chronicles of the Picts and Scots_ (Edinburgh, 1867), edited\r\n  1876, by W. F. Skene; and W. F. Skene, _Celtic Scotland_ (Edinburgh).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET (1489-1541), queen of Scotland, eldest daughter of Henry VII.,\r\nking of England, by his wife Elizabeth, daughter of Edward IV., was born\r\nat Westminster on the 29th of November 1489. Before she was six years\r\nold negotiations were opened, which dragged on for several years, for\r\nmarrying the princess to James IV. of Scotland, whose support of the\r\npretender Perkin Warbeck it was hoped to avert by such an alliance.\r\nEventually the marriage was celebrated in Edinburgh on the 8th of August\r\n1503. The avaricious Henry VII. gave his daughter a scanty dowry and\r\nquarrels on this head embittered the relations between the two kingdoms,\r\nwhich the marriage, although accompanied by a treaty of perpetual peace,\r\ndid nothing to heal. The whole of Margaret's life after her marriage\r\nwith James IV. was an unending series of intrigues, first with one\r\npolitical faction then with another; at one time in favour of her native\r\ncountry, at another in hostility to it, her conduct being mainly\r\ninfluenced at all times by considerations affecting her pocket.\r\n\r\nMargaret was crowned at Edinburgh in March 1504. Until 1507 she had no\r\nchildren; between that date and 1510 two sons and a daughter were born,\r\nall of whom died in infancy; in 1512 she gave birth to a son who\r\nsucceeded his father as James V.; in 1514 she bore a posthumous son,\r\nAlexander, created duke of Ross, who died in the following year. A\r\ndispute with her brother Henry VIII. over a legacy claimed by Margaret\r\nwas a contributory cause of the war which ended at Flodden, where James\r\nIV. was killed on the 9th of September 1513, having by his will\r\nappointed Margaret sole guardian of her infant son, now King James V.\r\nScotland was divided mainly into two parties, one in favour of alliance\r\nwith England, and the other with France. The leader of the latter was\r\nJohn Stewart, duke of Albany, next heir to the crown of Scotland after\r\nMargaret's sons; Margaret herself for the most part inclined to the\r\nEnglish faction; and when Albany returned to Scotland from France on the\r\ninvitation of the Scottish parliament in the spring of 1514, the\r\nconflict grew almost to civil war. Various projects for Margaret's\r\nremarriage had already been started, Louis XII. of France and the\r\nemperor Maximilian being proposed as suitable husbands for the young\r\nwidow, when the queen privately married Archibald Douglas, earl of\r\nAngus, on the 6th of August 1514. The consequences of this marriage were\r\nto alienate many of the most powerful of the nobility, especially the\r\nearls of Arran and Home, and to make Margaret entirely dependent on the\r\nhouse of Douglas; while it furnished the council with a pretext for\r\nremoving her from the regency and guardianship of the king in favour of\r\nAlbany in July 1515. Albany had to blockade Margaret in Stirling Castle\r\nbefore she would surrender her sons. After being obliged to capitulate,\r\nMargaret returned to Edinburgh, and being no longer responsible for the\r\ncustody of the king she fled to England in September, where a month\r\nlater she bore to Angus a daughter, Margaret, who afterwards became\r\ncountess of Lennox, mother of Lord Darnley and grandmother of James I.\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1516 Margaret went to her brother's court in London,\r\nwhile Angus, much to his wife's displeasure, returned to Scotland, where\r\nhe made his peace with Albany and was restored to his estates. The\r\nrivalry between the French and English factions in Scotland was\r\ncomplicated by private feuds of the Hamiltons and Douglases, the\r\nrespective heads of which houses, Arran and Angus, were contending for\r\nthe supreme power in the absence of Albany in France, where at the\r\ninstance of Henry VIII. he was detained by Francis I. Margaret,\r\nquarrelling with her husband over money matters, sided at first with\r\nArran and began to agitate for a divorce from Angus. In this she was\r\nprobably aided by Albany, who had been in Rome, and who found an\r\nunexpected ally in the queen-mother, Margaret being temporarily\r\nalienated from the English party by her brother Henry's opposition to\r\nher divorce. When Albany returned to Scotland in 1521 his association\r\nwith Margaret gave rise to the accusation that it was with the intention\r\nof marrying her himself that he favoured her divorce from Angus, and it\r\nwas even suggested that she was Albany's mistress. As Albany was\r\nstrongly supported by the Scottish parliament, Angus found it necessary\r\nto withdraw to France till 1524. During these years there was constant\r\nwarfare between the English and the Scots on the border, but in May 1524\r\nAlbany was obliged to retire to France. Henry VIII. continually aimed at\r\nsecuring the person of his nephew, the king of Scots; while Margaret\r\nveered from faction to faction without any settled policy, unless it\r\nwere the \"erection\" of her son, i.e. his proclamation as a reigning\r\nsovereign, which she successfully brought about in July 1524. The\r\nqueen-mother had at this time fallen in love with Henry Stewart, second\r\nson of Lord Avondale, whom she married immediately after obtaining her\r\ndivorce from Angus in 1527. Margaret and her new husband, who was\r\ncreated Lord Methven, now became for a time the ruling influence in the\r\ncounsels of James V. But when her desire to arrange a meeting between\r\nJames and Henry VIII. in 1534 was frustrated by the opposition of the\r\nclergy and the council, Margaret in her disappointment revealed certain\r\nsecrets to Henry which led to her being accused by her son of betraying\r\nhim for money and of acting as an English spy. In 1537 she was anxious\r\nto obtain a divorce from Methven, and her desire was on the point of\r\nbeing realized when it was defeated by the intervention of James. Two\r\nyears later she was reconciled to her husband, by whom she had no\r\nchildren; and, continuing to the end to intrigue both in Scotland and\r\nEngland, she died at Methven Castle on the 18th of October 1541.\r\n\r\n  See Andrew Lang, _History of Scotland_, vol. i.

M.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET (1283-1290), titular queen of Scotland, and generally known as\r\nthe \"maid of Norway,\" was the daughter of Eric II. king of Norway, and\r\nMargaret, daughter of Alexander III. king of Scotland. Her mother died\r\nsoon after Margaret's birth, and in 1284 the estates of Scotland decided\r\nthat if Alexander died childless the crown should pass to his\r\ngranddaughter. In March 1286 Alexander was killed and Margaret became\r\nqueen. The English king Edward I. was closely watching affairs in\r\nScotland, and in 1289 a marriage was arranged between the infant queen\r\nand Edward's son, afterwards Edward II. Margaret sailed from Norway and\r\nreached the Orkneys, where she died about the end of September 1290. The\r\nnews of this occurrence was first made known in a letter dated the 7th\r\nof October 1290. Some mystery, however, surrounded her death, and about\r\n1300 a woman from Leipzig declared she was Queen Margaret. The impostor,\r\nif she were such, was burned as a witch at Bergen.\r\n\r\n  See A. Lang, _History of Scotland_, vol. i. (Edinburgh, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET (1353-1412), queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, the daughter\r\nof Valdemar IV. of Denmark, was born in 1353 and married ten years later\r\nto King Haakon VI. of Norway. Her first act, after her father's death\r\n(1375), was to procure the election of her infant son Olaf as king of\r\nDenmark. Olaf died in 1387, having in 1380 also succeeded his father;\r\nand in the following year Margaret, who had ruled both kingdoms in his\r\nname, was chosen regent of Norway and Denmark. She had already given\r\nproofs of her superior statesmanship by recovering possession of\r\nSchleswig from the Holstein counts, who had held it absolutely for a\r\ngeneration, and who now received it back indeed as a fief (by the\r\ncompact of Nyborg 1386), but under such stringent conditions that the\r\nDanish crown got all the advantage of the arrangement. By this compact,\r\nmoreover, the chronically rebellious Jutish nobility lost the support\r\nthey had hitherto always found in Schleswig-Holstein, and Margaret, free\r\nfrom all fear of domestic sedition, could now give her undivided\r\nattention to Sweden, where the mutinous nobles were already in arms\r\nagainst their unpopular king, Albert of Mecklenburg. At a conference\r\nheld at Dalaborg Castle, in March 1388, the Swedes were compelled to\r\naccept all Margaret's conditions, elected her \"Sovereign Lady and\r\nRuler,\" and engaged to accept from her any king she chose to appoint. On\r\nthe 24th of February 1389, Albert, who had returned from Mecklenburg\r\nwith an army of mercenaries, was routed and taken prisoner at Aasle near\r\nFalköping, and Margaret was now the omnipotent mistress of three\r\nkingdoms. Stockholm then almost entirely a German city, still held out;\r\nfear of Margaret induced both the Mecklenburg princes and the Wendish\r\ntowns to hasten to its assistance; and the Baltic and the North Sea\r\nspeedily swarmed with the privateers of the _Viktualien brödre or\r\nVitalianer_, so called because their professed object was to revictual\r\nStockholm. Finally the Hansa intervened, and by the compact of Lindholm\r\n(1395) Albert was released by Margaret on promising to pay 60,000 marks\r\nwithin three years, the Hansa in the meantime to hold Stockholm in pawn.\r\nAlbert failing to pay his ransom within the stipulated time, the Hansa\r\nsurrendered Stockholm to Margaret in September 1398, in exchange for\r\nvery considerable commercial privileges.\r\n\r\nIt had been understood that Margaret should, at the first convenient\r\nopportunity, provide the three kingdoms with a king who was to be her\r\nnearest kinsman, and in 1389 she proclaimed her infant cousin, Eric of\r\nPomerania, king of Norway. In 1396 homage was rendered to him in Denmark\r\nand Sweden likewise, Margaret reserving to herself the office of regent\r\nduring his minority. To weld the united kingdoms still more closely\r\ntogether, Margaret summoned a congress of the three councils of state to\r\nKalmar in June 1397; and on Trinity Sunday, the 17th of June, Eric was\r\nsolemnly crowned king of Denmark, Norway and Sweden. The proposed act of\r\nunion divided the three _Rigsraads_, but the actual deed embodying the\r\nterms of the union never got beyond the stage of an unratified draft.\r\nMargaret revolted at the clauses which insisted that each country should\r\nretain exclusive possession of its own laws and customs, and be\r\nadministered by its own dignitaries, as tending in her opinion to\r\nprevent the complete amalgamation of Scandinavia. But with her usual\r\nprudence she avoided every appearance of an open rupture.\r\n\r\nA few years after the union of Kalmar, Eric, now in his eighteenth year,\r\nwas declared of age and homage was rendered to him in all his three\r\nkingdoms, but during her lifetime Margaret was the real ruler of\r\nScandinavia. So long as the union was insecure, Margaret had tolerated\r\nthe presence near the throne of \"good men\" from all three realms (the\r\n_Rigsraad_, or council of state, as these councillors now began to be\r\ncalled); but their influence was always insignificant. In every\r\ndirection the royal authority remained supreme. The offices of high\r\nconstable and earl marshal were left vacant; the _Danehoffer_ or\r\nnational assemblies fell into desuetude, and the great queen, an ideal\r\ndespot, ruled through her court officials acting as superior clerks. But\r\nlaw and order were well maintained; the licence of the nobility was\r\nsternly repressed; the kingdoms of Sweden and Norway were treated as\r\nintegral parts of the Danish state, and national aspirations were\r\nfrowned upon or checked, though Norway, as being more loyal, was treated\r\nmore indulgently than Sweden. Margaret also recovered for the Crown all\r\nthe landed property which had been alienated during the troublous days\r\nof Valdemar IV. This so-called \"reduktion,\" or land-recovery, was\r\ncarried out with the utmost rigour, and hundreds of estates fell into\r\nthe Crown. Margaret also reformed the Danish currency, substituting good\r\nsilver coins for the old and worthless copper tokens, to the great\r\nadvantage both of herself and the state. She had always large sums of\r\nmoney to dispose of, and a considerable proportion of this treasure was\r\ndispensed in works of charity. Margaret's foreign policy was sagaciously\r\ncircumspect, in sharp contrast with the venturesomeness of her father's.\r\nThe most tempting offer of alliance, the most favourable conjunctures,\r\ncould never move her from her system of neutrality. On the other hand\r\nshe spared no pains to recover lost Danish territory. Gotland she\r\npurchased from its actual possessors, Albert of Mecklenburg and the\r\nLivonian Order, and the greater part of Schleswig was regained in the\r\nsame way.\r\n\r\nMargaret died suddenly on board her ship in Flensborg harbour on the\r\n28th of October 1412. We know very little of her private character.\r\nContemporary records are both scanty and hostile to a sovereign who\r\nsqueezed the utmost out of the people. Craft and wiliness are the\r\nqualities most generally attributed to her, coupled with the cynical\r\npraise that \"in temporal matters she was very lucky.\"\r\n\r\n  See _Danmarks riges historie, den senere Middelalder_, pp. 358-412\r\n  (Copenhagen, 1897-1905); Erslev, _Danmarks historie under dronning\r\n  Margrethe_ (Copenhagen, 1882-1901); Hill, _Margaret of Denmark_\r\n  (London, 1898).     (R. N. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET OF ANJOU (1430-1482), queen of England, daughter of René of\r\nAnjou, titular king of Naples and Jerusalem, was born on the 23rd of\r\nMarch 1430. When just fourteen she was betrothed to Henry VI. king of\r\nEngland, and in the following year was brought to England and married at\r\nTitchfield Abbey, near Southampton, on the 23rd of April 1445. On the\r\n28th of May she was welcomed at London with a great pageant, and two\r\ndays later crowned at Westminster. Margaret's marriage had been\r\nnegotiated by William de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, and when she came to\r\nEngland, Suffolk and his wife were her only friends. Naturally she fell\r\nunder Suffolk's influence, and supported his policy. This, added to her\r\nFrench origin and sympathies, made her from the start unpopular. Though\r\nclever and good-looking, she was self-willed and imperious, and without\r\nthe conciliatory manners which her difficult position required. In\r\nalmost everything she was the opposite of her gentle husband, but\r\nentered into his educational schemes, and gave her patronage to the\r\nfoundation of Queen's College, Cambridge. Margaret's really active share\r\nin politics began after Suffolk's fall in 1450. She not only supported\r\nEdmond Beaufort, duke of Somerset, in his opposition to Richard of York,\r\nbut concerned herself also in the details of government, seeking not\r\nover-wisely pecuniary benefits for herself and her friends. But as a\r\nchildless queen her influence was limited; and when at last her only\r\nson, Edward, was born on the 13th of October 1453, her husband was\r\nstricken with insanity. From this time she was the ardent champion of\r\nher husband's and son's rights; to her energy the cause of Lancaster\r\nowed its endurance, but her implacable spirit contributed to its\r\nfailure. When York's protectorate was ended by Henry's recovery in\r\nJanuary 1455, Margaret, not content with the restoration of Somerset and\r\nher other friends to liberty and office, pushed her politics to\r\nextremes. The result was the defeat of the Lancastrians at St Albans,\r\nand for a year Margaret had to acquiesce in York's power. Yet at this\r\ntime one wrote of her: \"The queen is a great and strong laboured woman,\r\nfor she spareth no pain to sue her things to an intent and conclusion to\r\nher power\" (_Paston Letters_, i. 378). All the while she was organizing\r\nher party; and ultimately, in October 1456 at Coventry, procured some\r\nchange in the government. Though formally reconciled to York in March\r\n1458, she continued to intrigue with her partisans in England, and even\r\nwith friends in France, like Pierre de Brezé, the seneschal of Normandy.\r\nAfter the Yorkist failure at Ludlow in 1459, it was Margaret's\r\nvindictiveness that embittered the struggle by a wholesale proscription\r\nof her opponents in the parliament at Coventry. She was not present with\r\nher husband at Northampton on the 10th of July 1460. After romantic\r\nadventures, in which she owed her safety to the loyalty of a boy of\r\nfourteen, her only companion, she escaped with her little son to\r\nHarlech. Thence after a while she made her way to Scotland. From Mary of\r\nGelderland, the queen regent, she purchased the promise of help at the\r\nprice of surrendering Berwick. Margaret was still in Scotland at the\r\ndate of Wakefield, so was not, as alleged by hostile writers,\r\nresponsible for the barbarous treatment of York's body. But she at once\r\njoined her friends, and was with the northern army which defeated\r\nWarwick at St Albans on the 17th of February 1461; for the executions\r\nwhich followed she must bear the blame. After Towton Margaret with her\r\nhusband and son once more took refuge in Scotland.\r\n\r\nA year later she went to France, and with help from her father and Louis\r\nXI. equipped an expedition under Pierre de Brezé. She landed in\r\nNorthumberland in October, and achieved some slight success; but when on\r\nthe way to seek further help from Scotland the fleet was overwhelmed in\r\na storm, and Margaret herself barely escaped in an open boat to Berwick.\r\nIn the spring she was again trying to raid Northumberland, meeting with\r\nmany hardships and adventures. Once she owed her escape from capture to\r\nthe generosity of a Yorkist squire, who carried her off on his own\r\nhorse; finally she and her son were brought to Bamburgh through the\r\ncompassionate help of a robber, whom they had encountered in the forest.\r\nThence in August 1463 she crossed to Sluys in Flanders. She was almost\r\ndestitute, but was courteously treated by Charles the Bold, then count\r\nof Charolais, and so made her way to her father in France. For seven\r\nyears she lived at Saint-Michel-en-Barrois, educating her son with the\r\nhelp of Sir John Fortescue, who wrote at this time: \"We be all in great\r\npoverty, but yet the queen sustaineth us in meat and drink. Her highness\r\nmay do no more than she doth\" (_Works_, ii. 72, ed. Clermont). Margaret\r\nnever lost her hopes of her son's restoration. But when at last the\r\nquarrel between Warwick and Edward IV. brought her the opportunity, it\r\nwas with difficulty that she could consent to be reconciled to so old\r\nand bitter an enemy. After Warwick's success and Henry's restoration\r\nMargaret still remained in France. When at last she was ready to sail\r\nshe was delayed by contrary winds. So it was only on the very day of\r\nWarwick's defeat at Barnet (14th of April) that Margaret and Edward\r\nlanded at Weymouth. Three weeks later the Lancastrians were defeated at\r\nTewkesbury, and Edward was killed. Margaret was not at the battle; she\r\nwas captured a few days after, and brought to London on the 21st of May.\r\nFor five years she remained a prisoner, but was treated honourably and\r\nfor part at least of the time was in charge of her old friend the\r\nduchess of Suffolk. Finally Louis XI. ransomed her under the Treaty of\r\nPecquigny, and she returned to France on the 29th of January 1476.\r\nMargaret lived for six years at different places in Bar and Anjou, in\r\npoverty and dependent for a pension on Louis, who made her surrender in\r\nreturn her claims to her father's inheritance. She died on the 25th of\r\nApril 1482 and was buried at Angers Cathedral. René, whom she probably\r\nnever saw after 1470, had died in the previous year. During her last\r\nyears Chastellain wrote for her consolation his _Temple de Bocace_\r\ndealing with the misfortunes of contemporary princes.\r\n\r\nAs the courageous champion of the rights of her son and her husband,\r\nMargaret must command a certain sympathy. But she was politically\r\nunwise, and injured their cause by her readiness to purchase foreign\r\nhelp at the price of English interests. Comines wrote well of her that\r\nshe would have done more prudently if she had endeavoured to adjust the\r\ndisputes of the rival factions instead of saying \"I am of this party,\r\nand will maintain it\" (_Mémoires_ vi. ch. 13). Her fierce partisanship\r\nembittered her enemies, and the Yorkists did not hesitate to allege that\r\nher son was a bastard. This, like the scandal concerning Margaret and\r\nSuffolk, is baseless; the tradition, however, continued and found\r\nexpression in the _Mirror for Magistrates_ and in Drayton's _Heroical\r\nEpistles_, as well as in Shakespeare's _Henry VI_.\r\n\r\n  BIBLIOGRAPHY.--For contemporary English authorities see under HENRY\r\n  VI. French authorities and especially the _Chroniques_ of George de\r\n  Chastellain, and the _Mémoires_ of Philippes de Comines contain much\r\n  that is of value. The _Letters of Margaret of Anjou_ (Camden Soc.,\r\n  1863) have small historical importance. There have been numerous\r\n  biographies, the chief is Mrs Hookham's _Life of Margaret of Anjou_\r\n  (1872). But the best modern accounts are to be found in G. du Fresne\r\n  de Beaucourt's _Histoire de Charles VII._, Dr Gairdner's Introductions\r\n  to the _Paston Letters_, Sir James Ramsay's _Lancaster and York_\r\n  (1892), and _The Political History of England_, vol. iv. (1906), by\r\n  Professor C. Oman. Dr Karl Schmidt's _Margareta von Anjou, vor und bei\r\n  Shakespeare_ (Palaestra, liv., Berlin, 1906) is a useful digest of\r\n  authorities.     (C. L. K.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET OF AUSTRIA (1480-1530), duchess of Savoy and regent of the\r\nNetherlands from 1507 to 1530, daughter of the archduke Maximilian of\r\nAustria, afterwards the emperor Maximilian I., was born at Brussels on\r\nthe 10th of January 1480. At two years of age she was betrothed to the\r\ndauphin Charles, son of Louis XI. of France, and was brought up at the\r\nFrench court. In 1489, however, Charles, now king as Charles VIII., to\r\nprevent Maximilian taking as his second wife the duchess Anne of\r\nBrittany, threw over Margaret and married the Breton heiress himself.\r\nHer ambitious father now sought for Margaret another throne, and in\r\nApril 1497 she was married at Burgos to the Infant John, heir to the\r\nthrone of Castile and Aragon. She was left a widow, however, a few\r\nmonths later. In 1501 Margaret became the wife of Philibert II., duke of\r\nSavoy, who only survived until 1504. The sudden death of her brother the\r\narchduke, Philip the Handsome (Sept 25, 1506), opened out to her a new\r\ncareer. In 1507 she was appointed by her father regent of the\r\nNetherlands and guardian of her nephew Charles, afterwards the emperor\r\nCharles V. Charles came of age in 1515, but he entrusted Margaret with\r\nthe regency, as the vast extent of his dominions permitted him but\r\nseldom to visit the Netherlands, and she continued to hold the post\r\nuntil her death in 1530. She was a wise and prudent ruler, of masculine\r\ntemper and intrepidity, and very capable in affairs.\r\n\r\n  See E. Münch, _Margaretha von Österreich_ (Leipzig, 1883); Th.

Her\r\nmother, Margaret van Ghent, was a Fleming. She was brought up by her\r\naunts Margaret of Austria and Maria of Hungary, who were successively\r\nregents of the Netherlands from 1507 to 1530 and from 1530 to 1555. In\r\n1533 she was married to Alexander de' Medici, duke of Florence, who was\r\nassassinated in 1537, after which she became the wife of Ottavio\r\nFarnese, duke of Parma, in 1542. The union proved an unhappy one. Like\r\nher aunts, who had trained her, she was a woman of masculine abilities,\r\nand Philip II., when he left the Netherlands in 1559 for Spain, acted\r\nwisely in appointing her regent. In ordinary times she would probably\r\nhave proved as successful a ruler as her two predecessors in that post,\r\nbut her task was very different from theirs. She had to face the rising\r\nstorm of discontent against the Inquisition and Spanish despotism, and\r\nPhilip left her but nominal authority. He was determined to pursue his\r\nown arbitrary course, and the issue was the revolt of the Netherlands.\r\nIn 1567 Margaret resigned her post into the hands of the duke of Alva\r\nand retired to Italy. She had the satisfaction of seeing her son\r\nAlexander Farnese appointed to the office she had laid down, and to\r\nwatch his successful career as governor-general of the Netherlands. She\r\ndied at Ortona in 1586.\r\n\r\n  See L. P. Gachard, _Correspondance de Marguérite d'Autriche avec\r\n  Phillippe II. 1554-1568_ (Brussels, 1867-1887); R.

She was married to Saint Louis\r\nat Sens on the 27th of May 1234, and was crowned the next day. Blanche\r\nof Castile, the queen-mother, arranged the marriage to win over to the\r\ncause of France the powerful count of Provence, but treated her\r\ndaughter-in-law most unkindly, and her jealousy of the energetic young\r\nqueen was naturally shared by Louis, whose coldness towards and\r\nsuspicion of his wife are well known. Margaret did not lack courage, she\r\nfollowed the king on his crusade, and bore herself heroically at\r\nDamietta. But her ambition and strong personal prejudices often led her\r\nto actions injurious to the realm. This is most noticeable in her\r\nhostility to her brother-in-law Charles of Anjou, who had married her\r\nsister Beatrice, and her devotion to Henry III. of England, who had\r\nmarried her other sister Eleanor. Aspiring during the reign of her son\r\nto the same rôle which she had seen Blanche of Castile play, she\r\ninduced, in 1263, the young Philip, heir to the throne, to promise to\r\nobey her in everything up to the age of thirty; and Saint Louis was\r\nobliged to ask for a bull from Urban IV. which would release the prince\r\nfrom his oath. After Saint Louis' death, Margaret continued obstinately\r\nto claim her rights on the county of Provence against Charles of Anjou.\r\nShe sought to employ force of arms, calling upon her son, her nephew\r\nEdward II. of England, and the German king Rudolph of Habsburg. She did\r\nnot give up her claim until after the death of Charles of Anjou (1285),\r\nwhen Philip the Bold succeeded in getting her to accept an income from\r\nthe county of Anjou in exchange for her rights in Provence. She died on\r\nthe 31st of December 1295.\r\n\r\n  See E. Boutaric, _Marguérite de Provence_, in _Revue des questions\r\n  historiques_ (1867), pp. 417-458.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARET MAULTASCH (1318-1369), countess of Tirol, who received the name\r\nof Maultasch (pocket-mouth) on account of the shape of her mouth, was\r\nthe daughter and heiress of Henry, duke of Carinthia and count of Tirol.\r\nWhen Henry died in 1335 Carinthia passed to Albert II., duke of Austria;\r\nbut Tirol was inherited by Margaret and her young husband, John Henry,\r\nson of John, king of Bohemia, whom she had married in 1330. This union\r\nwas not a happy one, and the Tirolese disliked the government of\r\nCharles, afterwards the emperor Charles IV., who ruled the county for\r\nhis brother. The result was that John Henry was driven from Tirol, and\r\nMargaret's cause was espoused by the emperor Louis IV., who was anxious\r\nto add the county to his possessions. Declaring her marriage dissolved\r\non the ground that it had not been consummated, Louis married Margaret\r\nin 1342 to his own son Louis, margrave of Brandenburg. But as this\r\naction on the emperor's part entrenched on the privileges of the Church,\r\nPope Clement VI. placed father and son under the ban, from which they\r\nwere not released until 1359. In 1361 Margaret's husband died, followed\r\ntwo years later by her only son, Meinhard, when she handed over Tirol to\r\nRudolph IV., duke of Austria, and retired to Vienna, where she died on\r\nthe 3rd of October 1369. She lived long in the memory of the people of\r\nCarinthia, who regarded her as an amazon, and called her the _Wicked\r\nGretl_.\r\n\r\n  See A. Huber, _Geschichte der Vereinigung Tirols mit Oesterreich_\r\n  (Innsbruck, 1864).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARINE, the name, first given by Chevreul, to an artificial\r\nsubstitute for butter, made from beef and other animal fats, and\r\nsometimes mixed with real butter. The name of \"butterine\" has also been\r\nused. Artificial butter, or \"margarine-mouries,\" was for some years\r\nmanufactured in Paris according to a method made public by the eminent\r\nchemist Mège-Mouries. Having surmised that the formation of butter\r\ncontained in milk was due to the absorption of fat contained in the\r\nanimal tissues, he was led to experiment on the splitting up of animal\r\nfat. The process he ultimately adopted consisted in heating finely\r\nminced beef suet with water, carbonate of potash, and fresh sheep's\r\nstomach cut up into small fragments. The mixture he raised to a\r\ntemperature of 45° C. (113° F.). The influence of the pepsine of the\r\nsheep's stomach with the heat separated the fat from the cellular\r\ntissue; he removed the fatty matter, and submitted it when cool to\r\npowerful hydraulic pressure, separating it into stearin and\r\noleomargarin, which last alone he used for butter-making. Of this fat\r\nabout the proportions of 10 lb. with 4 pints of milk, and 3 pints of\r\nwater were placed in a churn, to which a small quantity of anatto was\r\nadded for colouring, and the whole churned together. The compound so\r\nobtained when well washed was in general appearance, taste and\r\nconsistency like ordinary butter, and when well freed from water it was\r\nfound to keep a longer time. Margarine is a perfectly wholesome\r\nbutter-substitute, and is now largely used, but the ease with which it\r\nmay be passed off as real butter has led to much discussion and\r\nlegislative action. (See ADULTERATION.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGARITA, an island in the Caribbean Sea belonging to Venezuela, about\r\n12 m. N. of the peninsula of Araya, and constituting, under the\r\nconstitution of 1904,--with Tortuga, Cubagua and Coche--a political\r\ndivision called the Eastern Federal District. The island is about 40 m.\r\nlong from east to west, has an area of 400 sq. m., and consists of two\r\nmountainous extremities, nearly separated by the Laguna Grande on the\r\nsouth, but connected by a low, narrow isthmus. The highest elevation on\r\nthe island is the peak of Macanao, 4484 ft., in the western part, the\r\nhighest point in the eastern part being the peak of Copei, 4170 ft. The\r\nhigher valleys of the interior are highly fertile and are well adapted\r\nto grazing and stock-raising. The principal industries are fishing and\r\nthe making of salt. The pearl fisheries, which were so productive in the\r\n16th and 17th centuries, are no longer important. A domestic industry of\r\nthe women is that of making coarse straw hats, which are sold on the\r\nmainland. The products of Margarita, however, are insufficient to\r\nsupport its population, and large numbers periodically emigrate to the\r\nmainland, preventing the increase in population which its healthful\r\nclimate favours. The population was estimated in 1904 at 40,000,\r\ncomposed in great part of half-caste Guayqueri Indians. The capital is\r\nAsunción (pop. about 3000), on the east side of the island, and its\r\nprincipal port is Pompatar on the south coast. The two small ports of\r\nPuebla de la Mar (_Porlamar_) and Puebla del Norte are merely open\r\nroadsteads.\r\n\r\nThe island of Margarita (from Span. _Margarita_, pearl) was discovered\r\nby Columbus in 1498, and was bestowed in 1524 upon Marceto Villalobos by\r\nCharles V. In 1561 the freebooter Lope de Aguirre ravaged the island,\r\nand in 1662 the town of Pompatar was destroyed by the Dutch. For a long\r\ntime Margarita was attached to Cumana, but in the eighteenth century it\r\nwas made administratively independent. Its traders and sailors rendered\r\ninvaluable assistance to the revolutionists in the war of independence,\r\nand the Spanish general, Morillo, was driven from its shores in 1817; in\r\nrecognition of this it was made a separate state and was renamed Nueva\r\nEsparta (New Sparta). In 1904-1909 it was a part of the Federal District\r\nwith Asunción as its capital. The first Spanish settlement in South\r\nAmerica was Nueva Cadiz, founded in 1515 on the barren island of\r\nCubagua; but the place was abandoned when pearl-fishing and\r\nslave-trading ceased to be profitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGATE, a municipal borough and seaside resort in the Isle of Thanet\r\nparliamentary division of Kent, England, 74 m. E. by S. of London by the\r\nSouth Eastern & Chatham railway. Pop. (1891), 18,662; (1901), 23,118. It\r\nlies on the north coast of Thanet, and is practically contiguous with\r\nWestgate on the west and with Broadstairs on the south-east, owing to\r\nthe modern extension of these popular watering-places. An electric\r\ntramway connects Margate with Broadstairs and Ramsgate, and during the\r\nseason it is served by numerous pleasure steamers from London. An\r\nesplanade faces the sea along nearly the entire front of the town, and\r\nis lined with hotels, shops and dwelling-houses. A jetty exceeding a\r\nquarter of a mile in length permits the approach of vessels at all\r\ntides. It was built in 1854 and subsequently enlarged, but a pier was\r\nconstructed by John Rennie in 1815, and is now chiefly used by fishermen\r\nand colliers. The church of St John the Baptist, founded in 1050,\r\ncontains some portions of Norman architecture, the remainder being\r\nDecorated and Perpendicular. It is rich in ancient brasses and\r\nmonuments, including a brass to Sir John Daundelyon (1443), whose family\r\noccupied a manor in the neighbourhood as early as the 13th century. The\r\nmanor house of Daundelyon, or Dent de Lion, with its gateway of the\r\nearly part of the 15th century, remains between Margate and Westgate.\r\nCharitable institutions include a deaf and dumb asylum (1875-1886), the\r\nMetropolitan infirmary for children (1841), and the royal sea-bathing\r\ninfirmary, established in 1791 and enlarged through the munificence of\r\nSir Erasmus Wilson in 1882. Dane Park (33 acres) was opened in 1898.\r\n\r\nMargate (Meregate, Mergate), formerly a small fishing village, was an\r\nancient and senior non-corporate member of Dover. In 1347 it contributed\r\n15 ships of small tonnage at the time of the siege of Calais. Throughout\r\nthe 14th century references are made to Margate in crown regulations\r\nregarding fisheries and shipping. A pier existed before 1500, but by the\r\nreign of Henry VIII. it was in a decayed condition. The amount of corn\r\nshipped was evidently small, the droits being insufficient to keep the\r\npier in repair. Under Elizabeth Margate was still an obscure fishing\r\nvillage employing about 20 small vessels (\"hoys\") in the coasting and\r\nriver trades, chiefly in the conveyance of grain, on which in 1791 it\r\nchiefly subsisted. The droits increased, but were not properly collected\r\nuntil 1724. In 1777 the pier was rebuilt. It was about this time that\r\nMargate first began to be known as a bathing-place owing to its fine\r\nstretch of firm sand. In 1835 Margate was still a liberty of Dover and\r\nno right of citizenship could be acquired. In 1857 it was incorporated.\r\nIn 1777 a weekly market was granted on Wednesday and Saturday. It is now\r\nheld daily, but principally on those two days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGGRAF, ANDREAS SIGISMUND (1709-1782), German chemist, was born at\r\nBerlin on the 3rd of March 1709. After studying chemistry at Berlin and\r\nStrassburg, medicine at Halle, and mineralogy and metallurgy at\r\nFreiberg, he returned to his native city in 1735 as assistant to his\r\nfather, Henning Christian Marggraf, chief apothecary at the court. Three\r\nyears later he was elected to the Berlin Academy of Sciences, which in\r\n1754 put him in charge of its chemical laboratory and in 1760 appointed\r\nhim director of its physics class. He died in Berlin on the 7th of\r\nAugust 1782. His name is especially associated with the discovery of\r\nsugar in beetroot. In 1747 he published an account of experiments\r\nundertaken with the definite view of obtaining true sugar from\r\nindigenous plants, and found that for this purpose the first place is\r\ntaken by beetroot and carrot, that in those plants sugar like that of\r\ncane exists ready formed, and that it may be extracted by boiling the\r\ndried roots in alcohol, from which it is deposited on cooling. This\r\ninvestigation is also memorable because he detected the minute\r\nsugar-crystals in the roots by the help of the microscope, which was\r\nthus introduced as an adjunct to chemical inquiry. In another research\r\ndealing with the nature of alum he showed that one of the constituents\r\nof that substance, alumina, is contained in common clay, and further\r\nthat the salt cannot be prepared by the action of sulphuric acid on\r\nalumina alone, the addition of an alkali being necessary. He explained\r\nand simplified the process of obtaining phosphorus from urine, and made\r\nsome admirable observations on phosphoric acid; but though he noted the\r\nincrease in weight that attends the conversion of phosphorus into\r\nphosphoric acid he was content to remain an adherent of the phlogistic\r\ndoctrine. For his time he was a skilful chemical analyst; he knew how to\r\ndistinguish potash and soda by the different colorations they produce in\r\nflame, and how to test for iron with prussiate of potash: he was aware\r\nthat sulphate of potash, gypsum and heavy spar, in spite of their\r\ndifferent appearances, all contain sulphuric acid; and he recognized\r\nthat there are different varieties of urinary calculi. In metallurgy he\r\ndevised improved methods for the manufacture of zinc and the\r\npurification of silver, tin and other metals.\r\n\r\n  His papers, mostly written in French, were presented to the Berlin\r\n  Academy, and with the exception of a few of the latest were collected\r\n  in two volumes of _Chymische Schriften_ in 1761-1767.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGHELAN, or MARGHILAN, a town of Asiatic Russia, situated in 40° 28´\r\nN. and 71° 45´ E., the administrative centre of the province of\r\nFerghana. Pop. (1900), 42,855, mostly Sarts, with Tajiks and Jews. It is\r\na very old town, with high earthen walls and twelve gates, commanded by\r\na fort. It lies in a beautiful, extraordinary fertile and well irrigated\r\ndistrict. The heat in summer is excessive. The principal industry is the\r\nmanufacture of silk; camels' hair and woollen fabrics are also made. The\r\nnew Russian town, founded in 1877, is 10 m. distant to the south-east,\r\nand has a population (1897) of 8977.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGRAVE (Ger. _Markgraf_), a German title meaning literally \"count of\r\nthe March\" (Lat. _marchio_, _comes marchae_, _marchisus_). The margraves\r\nhad their origin in the counts established by Charlemagne and his\r\nsuccessors to guard the frontier districts of the empire, and for\r\ncenturies the title was always associated with this function. The\r\nmargraves had within their own jurisdiction the authority of dukes, but\r\nat the outset they were subordinate to the dukes in the feudal army of\r\nthe empire. In the 12th century, however, the margraves of Brandenburg\r\nand Austria (the north and east marks) asserted their position as\r\ntenants-in-chief of the empire; with the break-up of the great duchies\r\nthe others did the same; and the margraves henceforward took rank with\r\nthe great German princes. The title of margrave very early lost its\r\noriginal significance, and was borne by princes whose territories were\r\nin no sense frontier districts, e.g. by Hermann, a son of Hermann,\r\nmargrave of Verona, who assumed in 1112 the title of margrave of Baden.\r\nThus, too, when the elector Albert Achilles of Brandenburg in 1473 gave\r\nBayreuth and Ansbach as apanages to his sons and their descendants these\r\nstyled themselves margraves. The title, however, retained in Germany its\r\nsovereign significance, and has not, like \"marquis\" in France and\r\n\"marchese\" in Italy, sunk into a mere title of nobility; it is not,\r\ntherefore, in its present sense the equivalent of the English title\r\n\"marquess.\" The German margraviates have now all been absorbed into\r\nother sovereignties, and the title margrave is borne only as a\r\nsubsidiary title in the full style of their sovereigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGUERITE, the popular name for the plant known botanically as\r\n_Pyrethrum_ (or _Chrysanthemum_) _frutescens_ (natural order\r\nCompositae), a shrubby perennial with smooth leaves cut pinnately into\r\nnarrow segments and flower-heads two to three inches across produced\r\nsingly in summer and autumn on slender erect stalks. The white\r\nray-florets surround a yellow disk. It is a native of the Canary Isles,\r\nand a favourite for decoration and for greenhouse cultivation,\r\nwindow-boxes and open ground in the summer. The yellow marguerite\r\n(_étoile d'or_) has somewhat larger pale yellow flowers and glaucous\r\nleaves. The plant is propagated from cuttings taken in autumn from old\r\nplants and placed in sandy loamy soil in cold frames. By pruning the\r\nshoots in autumn the plants may be grown into very large specimens in\r\nthe course of a few seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGUERITE DE VALOIS. The name Marguerite was common in the Valois\r\ndynasty, and during the 16th century there were three princesses, all of\r\nwhom figure in the political as well as in the literary history of the\r\ntime, and who have been not unfrequently confounded. The first and last\r\nare the most important, but all deserve some account.\r\n\r\nI. MARGUERITE D'ANGOULÊME (1492-1549). This, the most celebrated of the\r\nMarguerites, bore no less than four surnames. By family she was entitled\r\nto the name of Marguerite de Valois; as the daughter of Charles\r\nd'Orléans, count d'Angoulême, she is more properly, and by careful\r\nwriters almost invariably, called Marguerite d'Angoulême. From her first\r\nhusband she took, during no small part of her life, the appellation\r\nMarguerite d'Alençon, and from her second, Henri d'Albret, king of\r\nNavarre, that of Marguerite de Navarre. She was born at Angoulême on the\r\n11th of April 1492, and was two years older than her brother Francis I.\r\nShe was betrothed early to Charles, duke d'Alençon, and married him in\r\n1509. She was not very fortunate in this first marriage, but her\r\nbrother's accession to the throne made her, next to their mother Louise\r\nof Savoy, the most powerful woman of the kingdom. She became a widow in\r\n1525, and was sought in marriage by many persons of distinction,\r\nincluding, it is said, Charles V. and Henry VIII. In 1527 she married\r\nHenri d'Albret, titular king of Navarre, who was considerably younger\r\nthan herself, and whose character was not faultless, but who seems on\r\nthe whole, despite slander, to have both loved and valued his wife.\r\nNavarre was not reconquered for the couple as Francis had promised, but\r\nample apanages were assigned to Marguerite, and at Nérac and Pau\r\nminiature courts were kept up, which yielded to none in Europe in the\r\nintellectual brilliancy of their frequenters. Marguerite was at once one\r\nof the chief patronesses of letters that France possessed, and the chief\r\nrefuge and defender of advocates of the Reformed doctrines. Round her\r\ngathered C. Marot, Bonaventure Des Périers, N. Denisot, J. Peletier, V.\r\nBrodeau, and many other men of letters, while she protected Rabelais, E.\r\nDolet, &c. For a time her influence with her brother, to whom she was\r\nentirely devoted, and whom she visited when he was imprisoned in Spain,\r\nwas effectual, but latterly political rather than religious\r\nconsiderations made him discourage Lutheranism, and a fierce persecution\r\nwas begun against both Protestants and freethinkers, a persecution which\r\ndrove Des Périers to suicide and brought Dolet to the stake. Marguerite\r\nherself, however, was protected by her brother, and her personal\r\ninclinations seem to have been rather towards a mystical pietism than\r\ntowards dogmatic Protestant sentiments. Nevertheless bigotry and the\r\ndesire to tarnish the reputation of women of letters have led to the\r\nbringing of odious accusations against her character, for which there is\r\nnot the smallest foundation. Marguerite died at Odot-en-Bigorre on the\r\n21st of September 1549. By her first husband she had no children, by her\r\nsecond a son who died in infancy, and a daughter, Jeanne d'Albret, who\r\nbecame the mother of Henry IV. Although the poets of the time are\r\nunwearied in celebrating her charms, she does not, from the portraits\r\nwhich exist, appear to have been regularly beautiful, but as to her\r\nsweetness of disposition and strength of mind there is universal\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\n  Her literary work consists of the _Heptameron_, of poems entitled _Les\r\n  Marguerites de la marguerite des princesses_, and of _Letters_. The\r\n  _Heptameron_, constructed, as its name indicates, on the lines of the\r\n  _Decameron_ of Boccaccio, consists of seventy-two short stories told\r\n  to each other by a company of ladies and gentlemen who are stopped in\r\n  the journey homewards from Cauterets by the swelling of a river. It\r\n  was not printed till 1558, ten years after the author's death, and\r\n  then under the title of _Les Amants fortunés_. Internal evidence is\r\n  strongly in favour of its having been a joint work, in which more than\r\n  one of the men of letters who composed Marguerite's household took\r\n  part. It is a delightful book, and strongly characteristic of the\r\n  French Renaissance. The sensuality which characterized the period\r\n  appears in it, but in a less coarse form than in the great work of\r\n  Rabelais; and there is a poetical spirit which, except in rare\r\n  instances, is absent from _Pantagruel_. The _Letters_ are interesting\r\n  and good. The _Marguerites_ consist of a very miscellaneous collection\r\n  of poems, mysteries, farces, devotional poems of considerable length,\r\n  spiritual and miscellaneous songs, &c. The _Dernières poésies_, not\r\n  printed till 1896 (by M. A. Lefranc), are interesting and\r\n  characteristic, consisting of verse-epistles, _comédies_ (pieces in\r\n  dramatic form on the death of Francis I., &c.), _Les Prisons_, a long\r\n  allegorical poem of amorous-religious-historical tenor; some\r\n  miscellaneous verse chiefly in dizains, and a later and remarkable\r\n  piece, _Le Navire_, expressing her despair at her brother's death. Of\r\n  the other works, never yet completely edited, the best editions are,\r\n  for the _Heptameron_, Leroux de Lincy (1855); for the _Lettres_, Genin\r\n  (1841-1842); and for the _Marguerites_, &c., Frank (1873). English\r\n  translations of the _Heptameron_ are rather numerous: one appeared in\r\n  1887 by A. Machen, with an introduction by Miss A. M. F. Robinson (Mme\r\n  Darmesteter) and another (anonymous) in 1894, with an essay by G.\r\n  Saintsbury. The religious poem, _Le Miroir de l'âme pécheresse_ was\r\n  translated by Queen Elizabeth. Books on Marguerite and her court are\r\n  also many. There may be noted Durand's _Marguerite de Valois et la\r\n  cour de François I^er_ (1848); La Ferrière's _Marguerite d'Angoulême_\r\n  (1891); Lotheissen's _Königin Margareta von Navarra_ (1885); Miss\r\n  Edith Sichel's _Women and Men of the French Renaissance_ (1901), and\r\n  P. Courtault's _Marguerite de Navarre_ (1904).\r\n\r\nII. The second MARGUERITE (1523-1574), daughter of Francis I., was born\r\non the 5th of June, 1523, at St Germain-en-Laye, and, at an age the\r\nlateness of which caused lampoons, married Emmanuel Philibert, duke of\r\nSavoy, in 1559. Like her aunt and her niece she was a good scholar and\r\nstrongly interested in men of letters. She is noteworthy as having given\r\nthe chief impulse at the court of her brother Henry II. to the first\r\nefforts of the Pléiade (see RONSARD), and as having continued her\r\npatronage of literature at Turin. The poet Marc Antonio Flaminio, for\r\ninstance, congratulates himself in pretty Latin verses on her singing\r\nhis poems.\r\n\r\n  Her _Letters_ have been published by A. G. Spinelli.\r\n\r\nIII. The third MARGUERITE (1553-1615), called more particularly\r\nMarguerite de Valois, was great-niece of the first and niece of the\r\nsecond, being daughter of Henry II. by Catherine de' Medici. She was\r\nborn on the 14th of May 1553. When very young she became famous for her\r\nbeauty, her learning, and the looseness of her conduct. She was married,\r\nafter a liaison with the duke of Guise, to Henry of Navarre, afterwards\r\nHenry IV., on the eve of St Bartholomew's Day. Both husband and wife\r\nwere extreme examples of the licentious manners of the time, but they\r\nnot unfrequently lived together for considerable periods, and nearly\r\nalways on good terms. Later, however, Marguerite was established in the\r\ncastle of Usson in Auvergne, and after the accession of Henry the\r\nmarriage was dissolved by the pope. But Henry and Marguerite still\r\ncontinued friends; she still bore the title of queen; she visited Marie\r\nde' Medici on equal terms; and the king frequently consulted her on\r\nimportant affairs, though his somewhat parsimonious spirit was grieved\r\nby her extravagance. Marguerite exhibited during the rest of her life,\r\nwhich was not a short one, the strange Valois mixture of licentiousness,\r\npious exercises, and the cultivation of art and letters, and died in\r\nParis on the 27th of March 1615. She left letters and memoirs the latter\r\nof which are admirably written, and rank among the best of the 16th\r\ncentury. She was the idol of Pierre de Bourdeille Brantôme, and is the\r\n\"Reine Margot\" of anecdotic history and romance.\r\n\r\n  The _Mémoires_ are contained in the collection of Michaud and\r\n  Poujoulat, and have been published separately by Guessard (the best,\r\n  1842), Lalanne, Caboche, &c. An English translation with introduction\r\n  by Violet Fane appeared in 1892. Her character, and still more her\r\n  circumstances, made the pen very unamiably busy with her in her\r\n  lifetime, the chief of many lampoons being the famous _Divorce\r\n  satirique_, variously attributed to Agrippa d'Aubigné, Palma Cayet,\r\n  and others. The chief recent book on her is Saint Poucy's _Histoire de\r\n  Marguerite de Valois_ (1887).     (G. Sa.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARGUERITTE, PAUL (1860-   ) and VICTOR (1866-   ), French novelists,\r\nboth born in Algeria, were the sons of General Jean Auguste Marguerite\r\n(1823-1870), who after an honourable career in Algeria was mortally\r\nwounded in the great cavalry charge at Sedan, and died in Belgium, on\r\nthe 6th of September 1870. An account of his life was published by Paul\r\nMarguerite as _Mon père_ (1884; enlarged ed., 1897). The names of the\r\ntwo brothers are generally associated, on account of their\r\ncollaboration. Paul Marguerite, who has given a picture of his home in\r\nAlgiers in _Le Jardin du passé_ (1895), was sent to the military school\r\nof La Flèche for the sons of officers, and became in 1880 clerk to the\r\nminister of public instruction. He designed two pantomimes, _Pierrot\r\nassassin de sa femme_ (Théâtre Libre, 1882), and _Colombine pardonnée_\r\n(Cercle funambulesque, 1888), in which the traditional Pierrot, played\r\nby Margueritte himself, became a nervous, tragic creature. He resigned\r\nhis clerkship in 1889 to devote himself entirely to literature,\r\nproducing in rapid succession a series of novels, among which were _Tous\r\nquatre_ (1885), _La Confession posthume_ (1886), _Maison ouverte_\r\n(1887), _Pascal Géfosse_ (1887), _Jours d'épreuve_ (1889), _Amants_\r\n(1890), _La Force des choses_ (1891), _Sur le retour_ (1892), _La\r\nTourmente_ (1893), _Ma grande_ (1892), _Âme d'enfant_ (1894) and _L'Eau\r\nqui dort_ (1896). Paul Margueritte had begun as a realistic novelist,\r\nbut he was one of the five writers who signed a manifesto against Zola's\r\n_La Terre_, and he made his reputation by delicate, sober studies of the\r\nby-ways of sentiment. His brother Victor entered his father's regiment,\r\nthe 1st chasseurs d'Afrique, in 1888, and served in the army until 1896,\r\nwhen he resigned his commission. He was already known by some volumes of\r\npoetry, and by a translation from Calderon (_La Double méprise_, played\r\nat the Odéon, 1898) when he began to collaborate with his brother. From\r\nthe time of this collaboration Paul Margueritte's work gained in colour\r\nand force.\r\n\r\nAmong the books written in common by the brothers, the most famous is\r\nthe series known under the collective title, _Une Époque_, dealing with\r\nthe events of 1870-1871, and including the novels _Le Désastre_ (1898),\r\n_Les Tronçons du glaive_ (1900), _Les Braves gens_ (1901), _La Commune_\r\n(1904). They also collaborated in an _Histoire de la guerre de\r\n1870-1877_ (1903). These books were founded on a mass of documentary and\r\nverbal information, amassed with great care and arranged with admirable\r\nart; the authors are historians rather than novelists. The disasters and\r\nhumiliations of the campaigns are faithfully described, but are traced\r\nto defects of organization and leadership; while the courage and\r\npatriotism of the army itself is made the basis of an assured confidence\r\nin the destinies of France. _La Commune_ is a bold indictment of the\r\nmethods adopted by the victorious party. The novelists also attacked the\r\nlaws governing marriage and divorce and the abuses entailed by the dowry\r\ndemanded from the bride, in pamphlets and in the novels, _Femmes\r\nnouvelles_ (1899), _Les Deux vies_ (1902), and _Le Prisme_ (1905). Their\r\nliterary partnership was dissolved in 1907. Paul Marguerite was one of\r\nthe original members of the Académie de Goncourt.\r\n\r\n  See _P. et V. Margueritte_ (1905) by E. Pilon, in the series of\r\n  _Célébrités d'aujourd'hui_, and A. France, _La Vie littéraire_ (4th\r\n  series, 1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARHEINEKE, PHILIP KONRAD (1780-1846), German Protestant divine, was\r\nborn at Hildesheim, Hanover, on the 1st of May 1780. He studied at\r\nGöttingen, and in 1805 was appointed professor extraordinarius of\r\nphilosophy at Erlangen; in 1807 he moved to Heidelberg. In 1811 he\r\nbecame professor ordinarius at Berlin, where from 1820 he was also\r\npreacher at Trinity Church and worked with Schleiermacher. When he died,\r\non the 31st of May 1846, he was a member of the supreme consistorial\r\ncouncil. At first influenced by Schelling, Marheineke found a new master\r\nin Hegel, and came to be regarded as the leader of the Hegelian Right.\r\nHe sought to defend and explain all the orthodox doctrines of the Church\r\nin an orthodox way in the terms of Hegel's philosophy. The dogmatic\r\nsystem that resulted from this procedure was inevitably more Hegelian\r\nthan Christian; it was in fact an essentially new form of Christianity.\r\nMarheineke's developed views on dogmatics are given in the third edition\r\n(1847) of his _Die Grundlehren der christlichen Dogmatik als\r\nWissenschaft_. When he published the first edition (1819) he was still\r\nunder the influence of Schelling; the second edition (1827) marked his\r\nchange of view. His works on symbolics show profound scholarship, keen\r\ncritical insight, and rare impartiality. The _Christliche Symbolik_\r\n(1810-1814) has been pronounced his masterpiece.\r\n\r\n  His other works include _Institutiones symbolicae_ (1812; 3rd ed.,\r\n  1830), _Geschichte der deutschen Reformation_ (1816; 2nd ed.,\r\n  1831-1834); _Die Reformation, ihre Entstehung und Verbreitung in\r\n  Deutschland_ (1846; 2nd ed., 1858), and the posthumous _Theol.\r\n  Vorlesungen_ (1847-1849).\r\n\r\n  See F. Lichtenberger, _History of German Theology_ (1889); A. Weber,\r\n  _Le Système dogmatique de Marheineke_ (1857); and cf. O. Pfleiderer,\r\n  _Development of Theology in Germany_ (1890).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANA, JUAN DE (1536-1624), Spanish historian, was born at Talavera.\r\nHe studied at the university of Alcalá, and was admitted at the age of\r\nseventeen into the Society of Jesus. In 1561 he went to teach theology\r\nin Rome, reckoning among his pupils Robert Bellarmine, afterwards\r\ncardinal; then passed into Sicily; and in 1569 he was sent to Paris,\r\nwhere his expositions of the writings of Thomas Aquinas attracted large\r\naudiences. In 1574, owing to ill health, he obtained permission to\r\nreturn to Spain; the rest of his life being passed at the Jesuits' house\r\nin Toledo in vigorous literary activity. He died at Madrid, on the 17th\r\nof February 1624.\r\n\r\n  Mariana's great work, _Historiae de rebus Hispaniae_, first appeared\r\n  in twenty books at Toledo in 1592; ten books were subsequently added\r\n  (1605), bringing the work down to the accession of Charles V. in 1519,\r\n  and in a still later abstract of events the author completed it to the\r\n  accession of Philip IV. in 1621. It was so well received that Mariana\r\n  was induced to translate it into Spanish (the first part in 1601;\r\n  completed, 1609; Eng. trans., by J. Stevens, 1699). Mariana's\r\n  _Historiae_, though in many parts uncritical, is justly esteemed for\r\n  its research, accuracy, sagacity and style. Of his other works the\r\n  most interesting is the treatise _De rege et regis institutione_\r\n  (Toledo, 1598). In its sixth chapter the question whether it is lawful\r\n  to overthrow a tyrant is freely discussed and answered in the\r\n  affirmative, a circumstance which brought much odium upon the Jesuits,\r\n  especially after the assassination of Henry IV. of France, in 1610. A\r\n  volume entitled _Tractatus VII. theologici et historici_ (published by\r\n  Mariana at Cologne, in 1609, containing in particular a tract, \"_De\r\n  morte et immortalitate_,\" and another, _\"De mutatione monetae\"_) was\r\n  put upon the index expurgatorius, and led to the confinement of its\r\n  author by the Inquisition. During his confinement there was found\r\n  among his papers a criticism upon the Jesuits, which was printed after\r\n  his death as _Discursus de erroribus qui in forma gubernationis\r\n  societatis Jesu occurrunt_ (Bordeaux, 1625), and was reprinted by\r\n  order of Charles III. when he banished the Jesuits from Spain.\r\n\r\n  See L. von Ranke, _Zur Kritik neuerer Geschichtsschreiber_ (Leipzig,\r\n  1874), and Cirot, _Études sur les historiographes espagnols_;\r\n  _Mariana, historien_ (Bordeaux, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANAO, a city of the province of Havana, Cuba, 6 m. W. by S. of the\r\ncity of Havana, with which it is connected by the Marianao railway. Pop.\r\n(1899), 5416; (1907), 9332. Marianao is on a range of hills about 1500\r\nft. above the sea, is noted for its salubrious climate, and is mainly a\r\nplace of residence for the families of prosperous business men of\r\nHavana. On the neighbouring coast is Marianao Beach, a popular bathing\r\nresort. The city dates from about 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANAS, MARIANNES, or LADRONES (Ger. _Marianen_), an archipelago in\r\nthe north-western Pacific Ocean, in about 12° to 21° N. and 145° E. With\r\nthe exception of the island of Guam (United States) it belongs to\r\nGermany, and administratively forms part of the New Guinea protectorate.\r\nIt consists of two groups--a northern of ten volcanic main islands, of\r\nwhich only four (Agrigan, Anatahan, Alamagan and Pagan) are inhabited;\r\nand a southern of five coralline limestone islands (Rota, Guam, Aguijan,\r\nTinian and Saypan), all inhabited save Aguijan. In the volcanic group an\r\nextreme elevation of about 2700 ft. is reached, and there are craters\r\nshowing signs of activity, while earthquakes are not uncommon. Coral\r\nreefs fringe the coasts of the southern isles, which are of slight\r\nelevation. The total area, excluding Guam, is about 245 sq. m. and the\r\npopulation 2500, mostly descendants of the Tagal immigrants from the\r\nPhilippines. All the islands except Farallon de Medinilla and Urracas or\r\nMangs (in the northern group) are more or less densely wooded, and the\r\nvegetation is luxuriant, much resembling that of the Carolines, and also\r\nof the Philippines, whence many species of plants have been introduced.\r\nOwing to the humidity of the soil cryptogams are numerous, as also most\r\nkinds of grasses. Coco-nut and areca palms, yams, sweet potatoes,\r\nmanioc, coffee, cocoa, sugar, cotton, tobacco and mother-of-pearl are\r\nthe chief products, and copra is the principal export. Agriculture is\r\nneglected, in spite of the exceptional advantages offered by the climate\r\nand soil. On most of the islands there is a plentiful supply of water.\r\nThe native population known to the early Spanish colonists as Chamorros\r\nhas died out as a distinct people, though their descendants have\r\nintermarried with the immigrant Tagals and natives of the Carolines. At\r\nthe Spanish occupation in 1668 the Chamorros were estimated at 40,000 to\r\n60,000, but less than a century later only 1800 remained. They were\r\ntypical Micronesians, with a considerable civilization. In the island of\r\nTinian are some remarkable remains attributed to them, consisting of two\r\nrows of massive square stone columns, about 5 ft. 4 in. broad and 14 ft.\r\nhigh, with heavy round capitals. According to early Spanish accounts\r\ncinerary urns were found imbedded in the capitals.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the Marianas, though inferior in number and variety, is\r\nsimilar in character to that of the Carolines, and certain species are\r\nindigenous to both colonies. Swine and oxen run wild, and are hunted\r\nwhen required: the former were known to the earlier inhabitants; the\r\nlatter with most other domestic animals were introduced by the\r\nSpaniards. The climate though damp is healthy, while the heat, being\r\ntempered by the trade winds, is milder than that of the Philippines; the\r\nvariations of temperature are not great.\r\n\r\n  The discovery of this archipelago is due to Magellan, who on the 6th\r\n  of March 1521 observed the two southernmost islands, and sailed\r\n  between them (O. Peschel, _Geschichte des Zeitalters der\r\n  Entdeckungen_, Stuttgart, 1877). The name _Islas de los Ladrones_ (or\r\n  \"Islands of the Thieves\") was given them by the ship's crew of\r\n  Magellan on account of the thieving propensity of the inhabitants; and\r\n  the islands are still commonly called the Ladrones. Magellan himself\r\n  styled them _Islas de las Velas Latinas_ (\"Islands of the Lateen\r\n  Sails\"). San Lazarus archipelago, Jardines and Prazeres are among the\r\n  names applied to them by later navigators. They received the name _Las\r\n  Marianas_ in 1668 in honour of Maria Anna of Austria, widow of Philip\r\n  IV. of Spain. Research in the archipelago was carried out by Commodore\r\n  Anson, who in August 1742 landed upon the island of Tinian (George,\r\n  Lord Anson, _Voyage round the World_, bk. iii., 1748). The Ladrones\r\n  were visited by Byron in 1765, Wallis in 1767 and Crozet in 1772. The\r\n  entire archipelago (except Guam) together with the Caroline and Pelew\r\n  Islands was sold by Spain to Germany for £837,500 in 1899.\r\n\r\n  See Anson, _op. cit._; L. de Freycinet, _Voyage autour du monde_\r\n  (Paris, 1826-1844); \"The Marianas Islands\" in _Nautical Magazine_,\r\n  xxxiv., xxxv. (London, 1865-1866); O. Finsch, _Karolinen und Marianen_\r\n  (Hamburg, 1900); Costenoble, _\"Die Marianen\"_ in Globus, lxxxviii.\r\n  (1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANAS, or MARANHAS, a tribe of South American Indians on the river\r\nJutahy, north-western Brazil. They wear small pieces of wood in their\r\nears and lips, but are not tattooed. Marianas are also found on the\r\nupper reaches of the Putumayo across to the Yapurá.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIANUS SCOTUS (1028-1082 or 1083), chronicler (who must be\r\ndistinguished from his namesake Marianus Scotus, d. 1088, abbot of St\r\nPeter's, Regensburg), was an Irishman by birth, and called Moelbrigte,\r\nor servant of Bridget. He was educated by a certain Tigernach, and\r\nhaving become a monk he crossed over to the continent of Europe in 1056,\r\nand his subsequent life was passed in the abbeys of St Martin at Cologne\r\nand of Fulda, and at Mainz. He died at Mainz, on the 22nd of December\r\n1082 or 1083.\r\n\r\n  Marianus wrote a _Chronicon_, which purports to be a universal history\r\n  from the creation of the world to 1082. The _Chronicon_ was very\r\n  popular during the middle ages, and in England was extensively used by\r\n  Florence of Worcester and other writers. It was first printed at Basel\r\n  in 1559, and has been edited with an introduction by G. Waitz for the\r\n  _Monumenta Germaniae historica. Scriptores_ (Bd. v.). See also W.\r\n  Wattenbach, _Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen_ (Bd. ii., 1894).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIA STELLA, the self-styled legitimate daughter of Philip, duke of\r\nOrleans. According to her, Louis Philippe was not the son of Philip duke\r\nof Orleans, but a suppositious child, his father being one Lorenzo\r\nChiappini, constable at the village of Modigliana in Tuscany. The story\r\nis that the duke and duchess of Orleans, travelling under the incognito\r\nof Comte and Comtesse de Joinville, were at this village in April 1773,\r\nwhen the duchess gave birth to a daughter; and that the duke, desiring a\r\nson in order to prevent the rich Penthièvre inheritance from reverting\r\nto his wife's relations in the event of her death, bribed the Chiappinis\r\nto substitute their newly-born male child for his own.\r\n\r\nMaria Stella, the supposed daughter of Chiappini, went on the stage at\r\nFlorence, where her putative parents had settled, and there at the age\r\nof thirteen became the wife of the first Lord Newborough, after whose\r\ndeath she married the Russian Count Ungern-Sternberg. On the death of\r\nher putative father in 1821 she received a letter, written by him\r\nshortly before his death, in which he confessed that she was not his\r\ndaughter, adding \"Heaven has repaired my fault, since you are in a\r\nbetter position than your real father, though he was of almost similar\r\nrank\" (i.e. a French nobleman). Maria Stella henceforward devoted her\r\ntime and fortune to establishing her identity. Her first success was the\r\njudgment of the episcopal court at Faenza, which in 1824 declared that\r\nthe Comte Louis de Joinville exchanged his daughter for the son of\r\nLorenzo Chiappini, and that the Demoiselle de Joinville had been\r\nbaptized as Maria Stella, \"with the false statement that she was the\r\ndaughter of L. Chiappini and his wife.\" The discovery that Joinville was\r\na countship of the Orleans family, and a real or fancied resemblance of\r\nLouis Philippe to Chiappini, convinced her that the duke of Orleans was\r\nthe person for whose sake she had been cheated of her birthright, a\r\nconviction strengthened by the striking resemblance which many people\r\ndiscovered in her to the princesses of the Orleans family. In 1830 she\r\npublished her proofs under the title _Maria Stella ou un échange d'une\r\ndemoiselle du plus haut rang contre un garçon de plus vile condition_\r\n(reprinted 1839 and 1849). This coincided with the advent of Louis\r\nPhilippe to the throne, and her claim became a weapon for those who\r\nwished to throw discredit and ridicule on the \"bourgeois monarch.\" He\r\nfor his part treated the whole thing with amused contempt, and Baroness\r\nNewborough-Sternburg de Joinville, or Marie Étoile d'Orléans, as she\r\ncalled herself, was suffered to live in Paris until on the 23rd of\r\nDecember 1843 she died in poverty and obscurity.\r\n\r\n  In spite of much discussion and investigation, the case of Maria\r\n  Stella remains one of the unsolved problems of history. Sir Ralph\r\n  Payne Gallwey's _Mystery of Maria Stella, Lady Newborough_ (London,\r\n  1907), is founded on her own accounts and argues in favour of her\r\n  point of view. More convincing, however, is Maurice Vitrac's\r\n  _Philippe-Egalité et M. Chiappini_ (Paris, 1907), which is based on\r\n  unpublished material in the _Archives nationales_. M. Vitrac seeks to\r\n  overthrow Maria Stella's case by an alibi. The duke and duchess of\r\n  Chartres could not have been at Modigliana in April 1773, for the\r\n  simple reason that they can be proved at that time to have been in\r\n  Paris. On the 8th of April the duke, according to the official\r\n  _Gazette de France_, took part in the Maundy Thursday ceremonies at\r\n  Versailles; from the 7th to the 14th he was in constant attendance at\r\n  the lodge of Freemasons of which he had just been elected grand\r\n  master. Moreover, it was impossible for the first prince of the blood\r\n  royal to leave France without the royal permission, and his absence\r\n  would certainly have been remarked. Lastly, the duchess's\r\n  accouchement, a semi-public function in the case of royal princesses,\r\n  did not take place till the 6th of October. M. Vitrac identifies the\r\n  real father of Maria Stella with Count Carlo Battaglini of Rimini, who\r\n  died in 1796 without issue: the case being not one of substitution,\r\n  but of ordinary \"farming out\" to avoid a scandal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIA THERESA (1717-1780), archduchess of Austria, queen of Hungary and\r\nBohemia, and wife of the Holy Roman emperor Francis I., was born at Vienna\r\non the 13th of May 1717. She was the eldest daughter of the Emperor\r\nCharles VI. (q.v.) and his wife Elizabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. On\r\nthe 12th of February 1736 she was married to her cousin Francis of\r\nLorraine (q.v.), then grand duke of Tuscany, and afterwards emperor. Five\r\nsons and eleven daughters were born of this marriage. From the date of her\r\nfather's death on the 20th of October 1740, till her own death in 1780,\r\nMaria Theresa was one of the central figures in the wars and politics of\r\nEurope. But unlike some sovereigns, whose reigns have been agitated, but\r\nwhose personal character has left little trace, Maria Theresa had a strong\r\nand in the main a noble individuality. Her great qualities were relieved\r\nby human traits which make her more sympathetic. It must be allowed that\r\nshe was fairly open to the criticism implied in a husbandly jest\r\nattributed to Francis I. While they were returning from the opera house at\r\nVienna she said to him that the singer they had just heard was the\r\ngreatest actress who had ever lived, and he answered \"Next to you, Madam.\"\r\nMaria Theresa had undoubtedly an instinctive histrionic sense of the\r\nperspective of the theatre, and could adopt the appropriate attitude and\r\ngesture, passionate, dignified or pathetic, required to impress those she\r\nwished to influence. But there was no affectation in her assumption of a\r\nbecoming bearing or in her picturesque words. The common story, that she\r\nappeared before the Hungarian magnates in the diet at Pressburg in 1741\r\nwith her infant son, afterwards Joseph II., in her arms, and so worked on\r\ntheir feelings that they shouted _Moriamur pro rege nostro Maria\r\nTheresia_, is only mythically true. But during the delicate negotiations\r\nwhich were required to secure the support of the Hungarian nobles she\r\nundoubtedly did appeal to them with passionate eloquence, and, we may\r\nbelieve, with a very pardonable sense of the advantage she obtained from\r\nher youth, her beauty and her sex. Her beauty, inherited from her mother,\r\nwas of an open and noble German type. The official portrait by Muytens,\r\nengraved by Petit, gives a less convincing impression that an excellent\r\nchalk drawing of the head by Gabriel Mattei. In the conflict between her\r\nsense of what was morally just and her sense of duty to the state she laid\r\nherself open to the scoffing taunt of Frederick of Prussia, who said that\r\nin the first partition of Poland _elle pleurait et prenait toujours_. But\r\nthe king of Prussia's taunt is deprived of its sting by the almost\r\nincredible candour of her own words to Kaunitz, that if she was to lose\r\nher reputation before God and man for respecting the rights of others it\r\nmust not be for a small advantage--if, in fact, Austria was to share in\r\nthe plunder of Poland, she was to be consoled for the distress caused to\r\nher feelings by the magnitude of her share of the booty. There was no\r\nhypocrisy in the tears of the empress. Her intellectual honesty was as\r\nperfect as Frederick's own, and she was as incapable as he was of\r\nendeavouring to blind herself to the quality of her own acts. No ruler was\r\never more loyal to a conception of duty. Maria Theresa considered herself\r\nfirst and foremost as the heiress of the rights of the house of Austria.\r\nTherefore, when her inheritance was assailed at the beginning of her\r\nreign, she fought for it with every weapon an honest woman could employ,\r\nand for years she cherished the hope of recovering the lost province of\r\nSilesia, conquered by Frederick. Her practical sense showed her the\r\nnecessity of submitting to spoliation when she was overpowered. She\r\naccepted the peace of Berlin in 1742 in order to have a free hand against\r\nher Bavarian enemy, the emperor Charles VII. (q.v.). When Frederick\r\nrenewed the war she accepted the struggle cheerfully, because she hoped to\r\nrecover her own. Down to the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 she went on\r\nfighting for Silesia or its equivalent. In the years following the peace\r\nshe applied herself to finding allies in France and Russia who would help\r\nher to recover Silesia. Here, as later in the case of Poland, she\r\nsubordinated her feelings to her duty to the state. Though she denied that\r\nshe had ever written directly to Madame de Pompadour, it is certain that\r\nshe allowed her ministers to make use of the favourite's influence over\r\nthe French king. When fate decided against her in the Seven Years' War she\r\nbowed to the inevitable, and was thenceforward a resolute advocate of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nIn her internal government she showed herself anxious to promote the\r\nprosperity of her people, and to give more unity to an administration\r\nmade up by the juxtaposition of many states and races with different\r\ncharacters and constitutions. Her instincts, like those of her enemy\r\nFrederick and her son Joseph II., were emphatically absolutist. She\r\nsuspended the meetings of the estates in most parts of her dominions.\r\nShe was able to do so because the mass of her subjects found her hand\r\nmuch lighter than that of the privileged classes who composed these\r\nbodies. Education, trade, religious toleration, the emancipation of the\r\nagricultural population from feudal burdens--all had her approval up to\r\na certain point. She would favour them, but on the distinct condition\r\nthat nothing was to be done to weaken the bonds of authority. She took\r\npart in the suppression of the Jesuits, and she resisted the pope in the\r\ninterest of the state. Her methods were those of her cautious younger\r\nson, Leopold II., and not of her eldest son and immediate successor,\r\nJoseph II. She did not give her consent even to the suppression of\r\ntorture in legal procedure without hesitation, lest the authority of the\r\nlaw should be weakened. Her caution had its reward, for whatever she did\r\nwas permanently gained, whereas her successor in his boundless zeal for\r\nreform brought his empire to the verge of a general rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn her private life Maria Theresa was equally the servant of the state\r\nand the sovereign of all about her. She was an affectionate wife to her\r\nhusband Francis I.; but she was always the queen of Hungary and Bohemia\r\nand archduchess of Austria, like her ancestress, Isabella the Catholic,\r\nwho never forgot, nor allowed her husband to forget, that she was\r\n\"proprietary queen\" of Castile and Leon. She married her daughters in\r\nthe interest of Austria, and taught them _not_ to forget their people\r\nand their father's house. In the case of Marie Antoinette (q.v.), who\r\nmarried the dauphin, afterwards Louis XVI., she gave an extraordinary\r\nproof of her readiness to subordinate everything to the reason of state.\r\nShe instructed her daughter to show a proper respect to her husband's\r\ngrandfather, Louis XV., by behaving with politeness to his mistresses,\r\nin order that the alliance between the two courts might run no risk. The\r\nsigning of the peace of Teschen, which averted a great war with Prussia,\r\non the 13th of May 1779, was the last great act of her reign, and so\r\nMaria Theresa judged it to be in a letter to Prince Kaunitz; she said\r\nthat she had now finished her life's journey and could sing a _Te Deum_,\r\nfor she had secured the repose of her people at whatever cost to\r\nherself. The rest, she said, would not last long. Her fatal illness\r\ndeveloped in the autumn of the following year, and she died on the 28th\r\nof November 1780. When she lay painfully on her deathbed her son Joseph\r\nsaid to her, \"You are not at ease,\" and her last words were the answer,\r\n\"I am sufficiently at my ease to die.\"\r\n\r\n  See A. von Arneth, _Geschichte Maria Theresas_ (Vienna, 1863-1879) and\r\n  J. F. Bright, _Maria Theresa_ (London, 1897); also the article\r\n  AUSTRIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIAZELL, a village of Austria, in Styria, 89 m. N. of Graz. Pop.\r\n(1900), 1499. It is picturesquely situated in the valley of the Salza,\r\namid the north Styrian Alps. Its entire claim to notice lies in the fact\r\nthat it is the most frequented sanctuary in Austria, being visited\r\nannually by about 200,000 pilgrims. The object of veneration is a\r\nmiracle-working image of the Virgin, carved in lime-tree wood, and about\r\n18 in. high. This was presented to the place in 1157, and is now\r\nenshrined in a chapel lavishly adorned with objects of silver and other\r\ncostly materials. The large church of which the chapel forms part was\r\nerected in 1644 as an expansion of a smaller church built by Louis I.,\r\nking of Hungary, after a victory over the Turks in 1363. In the vicinity\r\nof Mariazell is the pretty Alpine lake of Erlafsee.\r\n\r\n  See M. M. Rabenlehrer, _Mariazell, Österreichs Loreto_ (Vienna, 1891);\r\n  and O. Eigner, _Geschichte des aufgeshobenen Benedictinerstiftes\r\n  Mariazell_ (Vienna, 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE AMÉLIE THÉRÈSE (1782-1866), queen of Louis Philippe, king of the\r\nFrench, was the daughter of Ferdinand IV., king of Naples, and the\r\narchduchess Maria Carolina, daughter of the empress Maria Theresa, and\r\nbelonged to the house of Bourbon. She was born at Caserta, on the 26th\r\nof April 1782, and received a careful education which developed the\r\nnaturally pious and honourable disposition that earned for her in the\r\nfamily circle the nickname of La Santa. Driven from Naples in 1798, the\r\nNeapolitan royal family fled to Palermo, and the years from 1800 to 1802\r\nwere spent by Marie Amélie with her mother at the Austrian court. In\r\n1806 they were again in flight before the armies of Masséna, and it was\r\nduring the second residence of her father's court at Palermo that she\r\nmet the exiled Louis Philippe, then duke of Orleans, whom she married in\r\nNovember 1809. Returning to France in 1814, the duke and duchess of\r\nOrleans had barely established themselves in the Palais Royal in Paris\r\nwhen the Hundred Days drove them into exile. Marie Amélie took refuge\r\nwith her four children in England, where she spent two years at Orleans\r\nHouse, Twickenham. Again in France in 1817, her life at Neuilly until\r\n1828 was the happiest period of her existence. Neither then nor at any\r\nother time did she take any active share in politics; but she was not\r\nwithout indirect influence on affairs, because her strong royalist and\r\nlegitimist traditions prevented the court from including her in the\r\nsuspicion with which her husband's liberal views were regarded. Her\r\nattention was absorbed by the care and education of her numerous family,\r\neven after the revolution of 1830 had made her queen of the French, a\r\nposition accepted by her with forebodings of disaster justified by her\r\nearly experience of revolutions. During her second exile, from 1848 to\r\nthe end of her life, she lived at Claremont, where her charity and piety\r\nendeared her to the many English friends of the Orleans family. Marie\r\nAmélie died at Claremont, on the 24th of March 1866.\r\n\r\n  See A. Trognon, _Vie de Marie Amélie_ (1872); A. L. Baron Imbert de St\r\n  Amand, _La Jeunesse de Marie Amélie_ (1891), _Marie Amélie au Palais\r\n  Royal_ (1892), _Marie Amélie et la cour de Palerme_ (1891), _Marie\r\n  Amélie et la cour des Tuileries_ (1892), _Marie Amélie et l'apogée de\r\n  règne de Louis Philippe_ (1893), _Marie Amélie et la société française\r\n  en 1847_ (1894), and _Marie Amélie et la duchesse d'Orleans_ (1893).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE ANTOINETTE (1755-1793), queen of France, ninth child of Maria\r\nTheresa and the emperor Francis I., was born at Vienna, on the 2nd of\r\nNovember 1755. She was brought up under a simple and austere régime and\r\neducated with a view to the French marriage arranged by Maria Theresa,\r\nthe abbé Vermond being appointed as her tutor in 1769. Her marriage with\r\nthe dauphin, which took place at Versailles on the 16th of May 1770, was\r\nintended to crown the policy of Choiseul and confirm the alliance\r\nbetween Austria and France. This fact, combined with her youth and the\r\nextreme corruption of the French court, made her position very\r\ndifficult. Madame du Barry, whose influence over Louis XV. was at that\r\ntime supreme, formed the centre of a powerful anti-Choiseul cabal, which\r\nsucceeded in less than a year after the dauphin's marriage in bringing\r\nabout the fall of Choiseul and seriously threatening the stability of\r\nthe Austrian alliance. Thus the young princess was surrounded by enemies\r\nboth at court and in the dauphin's household, and came to rely almost\r\nentirely upon the Austrian ambassador, the comte de Mercy-Argenteau,\r\nwhom Maria Theresa had instructed to act as her mentor, at the same time\r\narranging that she herself should be kept informed of all that concerned\r\nher daughter, so that she might at once advise her and safeguard the\r\nalliance. Hence arose the famous secret correspondence of\r\nMercy-Argenteau, an invaluable record of all the details of Marie\r\nAntoinette's life from her marriage in 1770 till the death of Maria\r\nTheresa in 1780.\r\n\r\nMarie Antoinette soon won the affection and confidence of the dauphin\r\nand endeared herself to the king, but her position was precarious, and\r\nboth Mercy and Maria Theresa had continually to urge her to conquer her\r\nviolent dislike for the favourite and try to conciliate her.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the young king and queen on the death of Louis XV. (May\r\n10, 1774), was hailed with great popular enthusiasm. But her first steps\r\nbrought Marie Antoinette into open hostility with the anti-Austrian\r\nparty. She was urgent in obtaining the dismissal of d'Aiguillon, and did\r\nall in her power to secure the recall of Choiseul, though without\r\nsuccess. Thus from the very first she appeared in the light of a\r\npartisan, having against her all the enemies of Choiseul and of the\r\nAustrian alliance, and was already given the nickname of\r\n\"l'autrichienne\" by mesdames the king's aunts. At the same time her\r\nundisguised impatience of the cumbrous court etiquette shocked many\r\npeople, and her taste for pleasure led her to seek the society of the\r\ncomte d'Artois and his young and dissolute circle. But the greatest\r\nweakness in her position lay in her unsatisfactory relations with her\r\nhusband. The king, though affectionate, was cold and apathetic, and it\r\nwas not till seven years after her marriage that there was any\r\npossibility of her bearing him an heir. This fact naturally decreased\r\nher popularity, and as early as September 1774, was made the subject of\r\noffensive pamphlets and the like, as in the case of the _affaire\r\nBeaumarchais_. (See BEAUMARCHAIS.)\r\n\r\nThe end of the period of mourning for the late king was the signal for a\r\nsuccession of gaieties, during which the queen displayed a passion for\r\namusement and excitement which led to unfortunate results. Being\r\nchildless, and with a husband who could not command her respect, her\r\nlonging for affection led her to form various intimate friendships,\r\nabove all with the princesse de Lamballe and the comtesse Jules de\r\nPolignac, who soon obtained such an empire over her affections that no\r\nfavour was too great for them to ask, and often to obtain. Thus for the\r\nbenefit of Madame de Lamballe the queen revived the superfluous and\r\nexpensive office of superintendent of her household, which led to\r\nconstant disagreements and jealousies among her ladies and offended\r\nmany important families. In frequenting the salons of her friends the\r\nqueen not only came in contact with a number of the younger and more\r\ndissipated courtiers, whose high play and unseemly amusements she\r\ncountenanced, but she fell under the influence of various ambitious\r\nintriguers, such as the baron de Bésenval, the comte de Vaudreuil, the\r\nduc de Lauzun and the comte d'Adhémar, whose interested manoeuvres she\r\nwas induced to further by her affection for her favourites. Thus she was\r\noften led to interfere for frivolous reasons in public affairs,\r\nsometimes with serious results, as in the case of the trial of the comte\r\nde Guines (1776), when her interference was responsible for the fall of\r\nTurgot. At the same time her extravagance in dress, jewelry and\r\namusements (including the gardens and theatricals at Trianon, of the\r\ncost of which such exaggerated reports were spread about) and her\r\npresence at horse-races and masked balls in Paris without the king, gave\r\nrise to great scandal, which was seized upon by her enemies, among whom\r\nwere Mesdames, the count of Provence, and the duke of Orleans and the\r\nPalais Royal clique.\r\n\r\nAt this critical period her brother, the emperor Joseph II., decided to\r\nvisit France. As the result of his visit he left with the queen a\r\nmemorandum in which he pointed out to her in plain terms the dangers of\r\nher conduct.[1] He also took advantage of his visit to advise the king,\r\nwith such success that at last, in 1778, the queen had the hope of\r\nbecoming a mother. For a time the emperor's remonstrances had some\r\neffect, and after the birth of her daughter, Marie Thérèse Charlotte\r\n(afterwards duchesse d'Angoulême) in December 1778, the queen lived a\r\nmore quiet life. The death of Maria Theresa (Nov. 29, 1780) deprived her\r\nof a wise and devoted friend, and by removing all restraint on the\r\nrashness of Joseph II. was bound to increase the dislike of the Austrian\r\nalliance and cause embarrassment to Marie Antoinette. Her position was\r\nvery much strengthened by the birth (Oct. 22, 1781) of a dauphin, Louis\r\nJoseph Xavier François, and on the death of Maurepas, which left the\r\nking without a chief minister, she might have exerted a considerable\r\ninfluence in public affairs had she taken a consistent interest in them;\r\nbut her repugnance to serious matters triumphed, and she preferred to\r\noccupy herself with the education of her children, to whom she was a\r\nwise and devoted mother,[2] and with her friends and amusements at\r\nTrianon. Personal motives alone would lead her to interfere in public\r\naffairs, especially when it was a question of obtaining places or\r\nfavours for her favourites and their friends. The influence of the\r\nPolignacs was now at its height, and they obtained large sums of money,\r\na dukedom, and many nominations to places. It was Madame de Polignac who\r\nobtained the appointment of Calonne as controller-general of the\r\nfinances,[3] and who succeeded Madame de Guéménée as \"governess of the\r\nchildren of France\" after the bankruptcy of the prince de Guéménée in\r\n1782.[4] Again, in response to Mercy and Joseph II.'s urgent\r\nrepresentations, Marie Antoinette exerted herself on behalf of Austria\r\nin the affairs of the opening of the Scheldt (1783-1784) and the\r\nexchange of Bavaria (1785), in which, though she failed to provoke\r\nactive interference on the part of France, she succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe payment of considerable indemnities to Austria, a fact which led to\r\nthe popular legend of her having sent millions to Austria, and aroused\r\nmuch indignation against her. Later, on the recommendation of Mercy and\r\nVermond, she supported the nomination of Loménie de Brienne in 1787, an\r\nappointment which, though widely approved at the time, was laid to the\r\nqueen's blame when it ended in failure.\r\n\r\nTwo more children were born to her; Louis Charles, duke of Normandy,\r\nafterwards dauphin, on the 27th of March 1785, and Sophie Hélène Beatrix\r\n(d. June 19, 1787), on the 9th of July 1786. In 1785-1786 the affair of\r\nthe Diamond Necklace (q.v.) revealed the depth of the hatred which her\r\nown follies and the calumnies of her enemies had aroused against her.\r\nThe public held her responsible for the bankrupt state of the country;\r\nand though in 1788, following the popular outcry, she prevailed upon the\r\nking to recall Necker, it was impossible for him to avert the\r\nRevolution. The year 1789 was one of disaster for Marie Antoinette; on\r\nthe 10th of March her brother Joseph II. died, and on the 4th of June\r\nher eldest son. The same year saw the assembling of the States-general,\r\nwhich she had dreaded; the taking of the Bastille, and the events\r\nleading to the terrible days of the 5th and 6th of October at Versailles\r\nand the removal of the royal family to the Tuileries. Then began the\r\nnegotiations with Mirabeau, whose high estimate of the queen is\r\nwell-known (e.g. his famous remark, \"The king has only one man on his\r\nside, and that is his wife\"). But the queen was violently prejudiced\r\nagainst him, believing him among other things to be responsible for the\r\nevents of the 5th and 6th of October, and he never gained her full\r\nconfidence. She was naturally incapable of seeing the full import of the\r\nRevolution, and merely temporised with Mirabeau. She dreaded the thought\r\nof civil war; and even when she had realized the necessity for decisive\r\naction the king's apathy and indecision made it impossible for her to\r\npersuade him to carry into effect Mirabeau's plan of leaving Paris and\r\nappealing to the provinces. Her difficulties were increased by the\r\ndeparture of Mercy for the Hague in September 1790, for Montmorin who\r\nnow took his place in the negotiations had not her confidence to the\r\nsame extent. Feeling herself helpless and almost isolated in Paris, she\r\nnow relied chiefly on her friends outside France--Mercy, Count Axel\r\nFersen, and the baron de Breteuil; and it was by their help and that of\r\nBouillé that after the death of Mirabeau, on the 8th of April 1791, the\r\nplan was arranged of escaping to Montmédy, which ended in the flight to\r\nVarennes (June 21, 1791).\r\n\r\nAfter the return from Varennes the royal family were closely guarded,\r\nbut in spite of this they still found channels of communication with the\r\noutside world. The king being sunk in apathy, the task of negotiation\r\ndevolved upon the queen; but in her inexperience and ignorance of\r\naffairs, and the uncertainty of information from abroad, it was hard for\r\nher to follow any clear policy. Her courageous bearing during the return\r\nfrom Varennes had greatly impressed Barnave, and he now approached her\r\non behalf of the Feuillants and the constitutional party. For about a\r\nyear she continued to negotiate with them, forwarding to Mercy and the\r\nemperor Leopold II. letters and memoranda dictated by them, while at the\r\nsame time secretly warning her friends not to accept these letters as\r\nher own opinions, but to realize that she was dependent on the\r\nConstitutionals.[5] She agreed with their plan of an armed congress, and\r\non this idea both she and Fersen insisted with all their might, Fersen\r\nleaving Brussels and going on a mission to the emperor to try and gain\r\nsupport and checkmate the _émigrés_, whose desertion the queen bitterly\r\nresented, and whose rashness threatened to frustrate her plans and\r\nendanger the lives of her family.\r\n\r\nAs to the acceptance of the constitution (Sept. 1791), \"tissue of\r\nabsurdities\" though the queen thought it, and much as she would have\r\npreferred a bolder course, she considered that in the circumstances the\r\nking was bound to accept it in order to inspire confidence.[6] Mercy was\r\nalso in correspondence with the Constitutionals, and in letter after\r\nletter to him and the emperor, the queen, strongly supported by Fersen,\r\ninsisted that the congress should be formed as soon as possible, her\r\nappeals increasing in urgency as she saw that Barnave's party would soon\r\nbe powerless against the extremists. But owing to the lengthy\r\nnegotiations of the powers the congress was continually postponed. On\r\nthe 1st of March 1792 Leopold II. died, and was succeeded by the young\r\nFrancis II. Marie Antoinette's actions were now directed entirely by\r\nFersen, for she suspected Mercy and the emperor of sacrificing her to\r\nthe interests of Austria (_Fersen_, i. 251; Arneth, pp. 254, 256, &c.).\r\nThe declaration of war which the king was forced to make (April 20)\r\nthrew her definitely into opposition to the Revolution, and she betrayed\r\nto Mercy and Fersen the plans of the French generals (Arneth, p. 259;\r\n_Fersen_, ii. 220, 289, 308, 325, 327). She was now certain that the\r\nlife of the king was threatened, and the events of the 20th of June\r\nadded to her terrors. She considered their only hope to lie in the\r\nintervention of the powers and in the appeal to force, and endorsed the\r\nsuggestion of a threatening manifesto[6] which should hold the National\r\nAssembly and Paris responsible for the safety of the king and royal\r\nfamily. Immediately after Brunswick's manifesto followed the storming of\r\nthe Tuileries and the removal of the royal family to the Temple (Aug.\r\n10). During all these events and the captivity in the Temple Marie\r\nAntoinette showed an unvarying courage and dignity, in spite of her\r\nfailing health and the illness of her son. After the execution of the\r\nking (Jan. 17, 1793) several unsuccessful attempts were made by her\r\nfriends to rescue her and her children, among others by Jarjayes, Toulan\r\nand Lepître, and the \"baron de Batz,\" and negotiations for her release\r\nor exchange were even opened with Danton; but as the allied armies\r\napproached her trial and condemnation became a certainty. She had\r\nalready been separated from her son, the sight of whose ill-treatment\r\nadded terribly to her sufferings; she was now parted from her daughter\r\nand Madame Elizabeth, and removed on the 1st of August 1793 to the\r\nConciergerie. Even here, where she was under the closest guard and\r\nsubjected to the most offensive espionnage, attempts were made to rescue\r\nher, among others Michonis' \"Conspiration de l'oeillet.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of October began her trial, her defence being entrusted to\r\nChauveau-Lagarde and Tronson-Ducourdray. Her noble attitude, even in the\r\nface of the atrocious accusations of Fouquier-Tinville, commanded the\r\nadmiration even of her enemies, and her answers during her long\r\nexamination were clear and skilful. The following were the questions\r\nfinally put to the jury:--\r\n\r\n  (1) Is it established that manoeuvres and communications have existed\r\n  with foreign powers and other external enemies of the republic, the\r\n  said manoeuvres, &c., tending to furnish them with assistance in\r\n  money, give them an entry into French territory, and facilitate the\r\n  progress of their armies?\r\n\r\n  (2) Is Marie Antoinette of Austria, the widow Capet, convicted of\r\n  having co-operated in these manoeuvres and maintained these\r\n  communications?\r\n\r\n  (3) Is it established that a plot and conspiracy has existed tending\r\n  to kindle civil war within the republic, by arming the citizens\r\n  against one another?\r\n\r\n  (4) Is Marie Antoinette, the widow Capet, convicted of having\r\n  participated in this plot and conspiracy?\r\n\r\nThe jury decided unanimously in the affirmative, and on the 16th of\r\nOctober 1793 Marie Antoinette was led to the guillotine, leaving behind\r\nher a touching letter to Madame Elizabeth, known as her \"Testament.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the justice of these charges, we have seen how the queen was\r\nactually guilty of betraying her country, though it was only natural for\r\nher to identify the cause of the monarchy with that of France. To civil\r\nwar she was consistently opposed, and never ceased to dissociate herself\r\nfrom the plans of the _émigrés_, but here again her very position made\r\nher an enemy of the republic. In any case, all her actions had as their\r\naim--firstly, the safeguarding of the monarchy and the king's position,\r\nand later, when she saw this to be impossible, that of securing the\r\nsafety of her husband and her son.\r\n\r\n  For a bibliographical study see: M.

The most important material for her life is to be found in\r\n  her letters and in the correspondence of Mercy-Argenteau, but a large\r\n  number of forgeries have found their way into certain of the\r\n  collections, such as those of Paul Vogt d'Hunolstein (_Correspondance\r\n  inédite de Marie Antoinette_, (3rd ed., Paris, 1864), and F.

Belloc, _Marie-Antoinett_, pp. 311-312, states that clause\r\n    VIII. of Brunswick's manifesto was \"drafted\" by Marie Antoinette,\r\n    i.e. that the idea of holding Paris responsible for the safety of the\r\n    royal family was first suggested by her. He bases this statement\r\n    entirely upon the queen's letters of July 3rd to Fersen, of July 4th\r\n    to Mercy, the reception of which Fersen notes in his Journal on July\r\n    8th and 9th (Fersen ii. 21). But these letters were obviously the\r\n    answer to Fersen's letter of June 30th to the queen (Fersen ii. 315),\r\n    in which he tells her the terms of the manifesto. Moreover, the\r\n    suggestion of holding the Assembly responsible is to be found as\r\n    early as in the memo. of the Constitutionals of September the 8th,\r\n    1791, and is included in the Instructions of Mallet du Pan (Mems. ed.\r\n    Sayous, i. 281, and appendix 445). Fersen (_Fersen_ ii. 329, 337,\r\n    18th July and 28th July to the queen, and p. 338, 29th July to Taube)\r\n    states that it was he who drew up the manifesto by means of the\r\n    marquis de Limon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE DE FRANCE (fl. c. 1175-1190), French poet and fabulist. In the\r\nintroduction (c. 1240) to his _Vie Seint Edmund le Rey_[1] Denis Pyramus\r\nsays she was one of the most popular of authors with counts, barons and\r\nknights, but especially with ladies. She is also mentioned by the\r\nanonymous author of the _Couronnement Renart_. Her lays were translated\r\ninto Norwegian[2] by order of Haakon IV.; and Thomas Chestre, who is\r\ngenerally supposed to have lived in the reign of Henry VI., gave a\r\nversion of _Lanval_.[3] Very little is known about her history, and\r\nuntil comparatively recently the very century in which she lived\r\nremained a matter of dispute. In spite of her own statement in the\r\nepilogue to her fables: \"Marie ai num, si suis de France,\" generally\r\ninterpreted to mean that Marie was a native of the Île de France, she\r\nseems to have been of Norman origin, and certainly spent most of her\r\nlife in England. Her language, however, shows little trace of\r\nAnglo-Norman provincialism. Like Wace, she used a literary dialect which\r\nprobably differed very widely from common Norman speech. The manuscripts\r\nin which Marie's poems are preserved date from the late 13th or even the\r\n14th century, but the language fixes the date of the poems in the second\r\nhalf of the 12th century. The _Lais_ are dedicated to an unknown king,\r\nwho is identified as Henry II. of England; and the fables, her _Ysopet_,\r\nwere written according to the _Epilogus_ for a Count William, generally\r\nrecognized to be William Longsword, earl of Salisbury. The author of\r\n_Couronnement Renart_, says that Marie had dedicated her poem to the\r\ncount William to whom the unknown poet addresses himself. This is\r\nWilliam of Dampierre (d. 1251), the husband of the countess Margaret of\r\nFlanders, and his identification with Marie's count William is almost\r\ncertainly an error. Marie lived and wrote at the court of Henry II.,\r\nwhich was very literary and purely French. Queen Eleanor was a\r\nProvençal, and belonged to a family in which the patronage of poetry was\r\na tradition. There is no evidence to show whether Marie was of noble\r\norigin or simply pursued the profession of a _trouvère_ for her living.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the _lais_ has been the subject of much discussion. Marie\r\nherself says that she had heard them sung by Breton minstrels. It seems\r\nprobable that it is the lesser or French Brittany from which the stories\r\nwere derived, though something may be due to Welsh and Cornish sources.\r\nGaston Paris (_Romania_, vol. xv.) maintained that Marie had heard the\r\nstories from English minstrels, who had assimilated the Celtic legends.\r\nIn any case the Breton lays offer abundant evidence of traditions from\r\nScandinavian and Oriental sources. The _Guigemar_ of Marie de France\r\npresents marked analogies with the ordinary Oriental romance of escape\r\nfrom a harem, for instance, with details superadded from classical\r\nmythology. Marie seems to have contented herself with giving new\r\nliterary form to the stories she heard by turning them into Norman\r\noctosyllabic verse, and apparently made few radical changes from her\r\noriginals. Joseph Bédier thinks that the lays of the Breton minstrels\r\nwere prose recitals interspersed with short lyrics something after the\r\nmanner of the cante-fable of _Aucassin et Nicolette_. Marie's task was\r\nto give these cante-fables a narrative form destined to be read rather\r\nthan sung or recited.\r\n\r\n  The _Lais_ which may be definitely attributed to Marie are:\r\n  _Guigemar_, _Equitan_, _Le Frêne_, _Le Bisclavret_ (the werewolf),\r\n  _Les Deux amants_, _Laustic_, _Chaitivel_, _Lanval_, _Le\r\n  Chèvrefeuille_, _Milon_, _Yonec_ and _Eliduc_. The other similar lays\r\n  are anonymous except the _Lai d'Ignaure_ by Renant and the Lai du cor\r\n  of Robert Biket, two authors otherwise unknown. They vary in length\r\n  from some twelve thousand lines to about a hundred. _Le\r\n  Chèvrefeuille_, a short episode of the Tristan story, telling how\r\n  Tristan makes known his presence in the wood to Iseult, is the best\r\n  known of them all. Laustic[4] (_Le Rossignol_) is almost as short and\r\n  simple. In _Yonec_ a mysterious bird visits the lady kept in durance\r\n  by an old husband, and is turned into a valiant knight. The lover is\r\n  killed by the husband, but in due time is avenged by his son. The\r\n  scene of the story is partly laid in Chester, but the fable in\r\n  slightly different forms occurs in the folk-lore of many countries.[5]\r\n  _Lanval_[6] is a fairy story, and the hero vanishes eventually with\r\n  his fairy princess to the island of Avallon or Avilion. _Eliduc_ is\r\n  more elaborately planned than any of these, and the action is divided\r\n  between Exeter and Brittany. Here again the story of the man with two\r\n  brides is not new, but the three characters of the story are so dealt\r\n  with that each wins the reader's sympathy. The resignation of the wife\r\n  of Eliduc and her reception of the new bride find a parallel in\r\n  another of the lays, _Le Frêne_. The story is in both cases more\r\n  human and less repugnant than the, in some respects, similar story of\r\n  Griselda.\r\n\r\n  Marie's _Ysopet_ is translated from an English original which she\r\n  erroneously attributed to Alfred the Great, who had, she said,\r\n  translated it from the Latin. The collection includes many fables that\r\n  have come down from Phaedrus, some Oriental stories derived from\r\n  Jewish sources, with many popular apologues that belong to the Renard\r\n  cycle, and differ from those of older origin in that they are intended\r\n  to amuse rather than to instruct. Marie describes the misery of the\r\n  poor under the feudal régime, but she preaches resignation rather than\r\n  revolt. The popularity of this collection is attested by the\r\n  twenty-three MSS. of it that have been preserved.\r\n\r\n  Another poem attributed to Marie de France is _L'Espurgatoire Seint\r\n  Patriz_, a translation from the _Tractatus de purgatorio S. Patricii_\r\n  (c. 1185) of Henri de Salterey, which brings her activity down almost\r\n  to the close of the century.\r\n\r\n  See _Die Fabeln der Marie de France_ (1898), edited by Karl Warnke\r\n  with the help of materials left by Eduard Mall; and _Die Lais der\r\n  Marie de France_ (2nd ed., 1900), edited by Karl Warnke, with\r\n  comparative notes by Reinhold Köhler; the two works being vols. vi.\r\n  and iii. of the _Bibliotheca Normannica_ of Hermann Suchier; also an\r\n  extremely interesting article by Joseph Bédier in the _Revue des deux\r\n  mondes_ (Oct. 1891); another by Alice Kemp-Welch in the _Nineteenth\r\n  Century_ (Dec. 1907). For an analysis of the _Lais_ see _Revue de\r\n  philologie française_, viii. 161 seq.; Karl Warnke, _Die Quellen der\r\n  Esope der Marie de France_ (1900). The _Lais_ were first published in\r\n  1819 by B. de Roquefort. _L'Espurgatoire Seint Patriz_ was edited by\r\n  T. A. Jenkins (Philadelphia, 1894). Some of the _Lays_ were\r\n  paraphrased by Arthur O'Shaughnessy in his _Lays of France_ (1872).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Cotton MS. Domit. A xi.

She received a good education\r\nin company with her half-brother Antonio. After many projects of\r\nmarriage for Marie had failed Henry IV. of France, who was under great\r\nmonetary obligations to the house of Medici, offered himself as a suitor\r\nalthough his marriage with Marguerite de Valois was not yet dissolved;\r\nbut the marriage was not celebrated until October 1600. Her eldest son,\r\nthe future Louis XIII., was born at Fontainebleau in September of the\r\nnext year; the other children who survived were Gaston duke of Orleans;\r\nElizabeth queen of Spain; Christine duchess of Savoy; and Henrietta\r\nMaria queen of England. During her husband's lifetime Marie de' Medici\r\nshowed little sign of political taste or ability; but after his murder\r\nin 1610 when she became regent, she devoted herself to affairs with\r\nunfailing regularity and developed an inherited passion for power. She\r\ngave her confidence chiefly to Concini, the husband of Leonora Galigaï,\r\nwho squandered the public money and secured a series of important\r\ncharges with the title of Maréchal d'Ancre. Under the regent's lax and\r\ncapricious rule the princes of the blood and the great nobles of the\r\nkingdom revolted; and the queen, too weak to assert her authority,\r\nconsented at Sainte Menehould (May 15, 1614) to buy off the discontented\r\nprinces. In 1616 her policy was strengthened by the accession to her\r\ncouncils of Richelieu, who had come to the front at the meeting of the\r\nstates general in 1614; but Louis XIII., who was now sixteen years old,\r\nwas determined to throw off the tutelage of his mother and Concini. By\r\nhis orders Concini was murdered, Leonora Galigaï was tried for sorcery\r\nand beheaded, Richelieu was banished to his bishopric, and the queen was\r\nexiled to Blois. After two years of virtual imprisonment she escaped in\r\n1619 and became the centre of a new revolt. Louis XIII. easily dispersed\r\nthe rebels, but through the mediation of Richelieu was reconciled with\r\nhis mother, who was allowed to hold a small court at Angers, and resumed\r\nher place in the royal council in 1621. But differences between her and\r\nthe cardinal rapidly arose, and the queen mother intrigued to drive\r\nRichelieu again from court. For a single day the _journée des dupes_,\r\nthe 12th of November 1630, she seemed to have succeeded; but the triumph\r\nof Richelieu was followed by her exile to Compiêgne, whence she escaped\r\nin 1631 to Brussels. From that time till her death at Cologne on the 3rd\r\nof July 1642 she intrigued in vain against the cardinal.\r\n\r\n  Among contemporary authorities for the history of Marie de' Medici,\r\n  see Mathieu de Morgues, _Deux faces de la vie et de la mort de Marie\r\n  de Médicis_ (Antwerp, 1643); J.

It lies in 15° 55´\r\nN. and 61° 17´ W., 16 m. S.E. of Guadeloupe, of which it is a\r\ndependency. It is nearly circular in shape and 55 sq. m. in area. A\r\nrocky limestone plateau, rising in the east to a height of 675 ft.,\r\noccupies the centre of the island, and from it the land descends in a\r\nseries of well-wooded terraces to the sea. The shores are rocky, there\r\nare no harbours, and the roadstead off Grand Bourg is difficult of\r\naccess, owing to the surrounding reefs. The climate is healthy and the\r\nsoil rich; sugar, coffee and cotton being the chief products. The\r\nlargest town is Grand Bourg (pop. 6901) on the south-west coast. The\r\nisland was discovered by Columbus in 1493, and received its name from\r\nthe vessel on which he was sailing. The French who settled here in 1648\r\nsuffered numerous attacks both from the Dutch and the British, but since\r\n1766, except for a short period of British rule in the early part of the\r\n19th century, they have held undisturbed possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE LESZCZYNSKA (1703-1768), queen consort of France, was born at\r\nBreslau on the 23rd of June 1703, being the daughter of Stanislas\r\nLeszczynski (who in 1704 became king of Poland) and of Catherine\r\nOpalinska. During a temporary flight from Warsaw the child was lost, and\r\neventually discovered in a stable; on another occasion she was for\r\nsafety's sake hidden in an oven. In his exile Stanislas found his chief\r\nconsolation in superintending the education of his daughter. Madame de\r\nPrie first suggested the Polish princess as a bride for Louis duke of\r\nBourbon, but she was soon betrothed not to him but to Louis XV., a step\r\nwhich was the outcome of the jealousies of the houses of Condé and\r\nOrléans, and was everywhere regarded as a _mésalliance_ for the French\r\nking. The marriage took place at Fontainebleau on the 5th of September\r\n1725. Marie's one attempt to interfere in politics, an effort to prevent\r\nthe disgrace of the duke of Bourbon, was the beginning of her husband's\r\nalienation from her; and after the birth of her seventh child Louise,\r\nMarie was practically deserted by Louis, who openly avowed his _liaison_\r\nwith Louise de Nesle, comtesse de Mailly, who was replaced in turn by\r\nher sisters Pauline marquise de Vintimille, and Marie Anne, duchess de\r\nChâteauroux, and these by Madame de Pompadour. In the meantime the queen\r\nsaw her father Stanislas established in Lorraine, and the affectionate\r\nintimacy which she maintained with him was the chief consolation of her\r\nharassed life. After a momentary reconciliation with Louis during his\r\nillness at Metz in 1744, Marie shut herself up more closely with her own\r\ncircle of friends until her death at Versailles on the 24th of June\r\n1768.\r\n\r\n  See V. des Diguières, _Lettres inédites de le reine Marie Leczinska et\r\n  de la duchesse de Luynes au Président Hénault_ (1886); Marquise des\r\n  Réaux, _Le Roi Stanislas et Marie Leczinska_ (1895); P. de Raynal, _Le\r\n  Mariage d'un roi_ (Paris, 1887); H.

Dussieux and Soulié, 1860, &c.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE LOUISE (1791-1847), second wife of Napoleon I., was the daughter\r\nof Francis I., emperor of Austria, and of the princess Theresa of\r\nNaples, and was born on the 12th of December 1791. Her disposition,\r\nfresh and natural but lacking the qualities that make for distinction,\r\ngave no promise of eminence until reasons of state brought Napoleon\r\nshortly after his divorce of Josephine to sue for her hand (see NAPOLEON\r\nand JOSEPHINE). It is probable, though not quite certain, that the first\r\nsuggestions as to this marriage alliance emanated secretly from the\r\nAustrian chancellor, Metternich. The prince de Ligne claimed to have\r\nbeen instrumental in arranging it. In any case the proposal was well\r\nreceived at Paris both by Napoleon and by his ministers; and though\r\nthere were difficulties respecting the divorce, of Josephine, yet these\r\nwere surmounted in a way satisfactory to the emperor and the prelates of\r\nAustria. The marriage took place by proxy in the church of St Augustine,\r\nVienna, on the 11th of March 1810. The new empress was escorted into\r\nFrance by Queen Caroline Murat, for whom she soon conceived a feeling of\r\ndistrust. The civil and religious contracts took place at Paris early in\r\nApril, and during the honeymoon, spent at the palace of Compiègne, the\r\nemperor showed the greatest regard for his wife. \"He is so evidently in\r\nlove with her,\" wrote Metternich \"that he cannot conceal his feelings,\r\nand all his customary ways of life are subordinate to her wishes.\" His\r\njoy was complete when on the 20th of March 1811 she bore him a son who\r\nwas destined to bear the empty titles of \"king of Rome\" and \"Napoleon\r\nII.\" The regard of Napoleon for his consort was evidenced shortly before\r\nthe birth of this prince, when he bade the physicians, if the lives of\r\nthe mother and of the child could not both be saved, to spare her life.\r\nUnder Marie Louise the etiquette of the court of France became more\r\nstately and the ritual of religious ceremonies more elaborate. Before\r\nthe campaign of 1812 she accompanied the emperor to Dresden; but after\r\nthat scene of splendour misfortunes crowded upon Napoleon. In January\r\n1814 he appointed her to act as regent of France (with Joseph Bonaparte\r\nas lieutenant-general) during his absence in the field.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Napoleon's first abdication (April 11, 1814), Joseph and\r\nJerome Bonaparte tried to keep the empress under some measure of\r\nrestraint at Blois; but she succeeded in reaching her father the emperor\r\nFrancis while Napoleon was on his way to Elba. She, along with her son,\r\nwas escorted into Austria by Count von Neipperg, and refused to comply\r\nwith the entreaties and commands of Napoleon to proceed to Elba; and her\r\nalienation from him was completed when he ventured to threaten her with\r\na forcible abduction if she did not obey. During the Hundred Days she\r\nremained in Austria and manifested no desire for the success of Napoleon\r\nin France. At the Congress of Vienna the Powers awarded to her and her\r\nson the duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, in conformity with the\r\nterms of the treaty of Fontainebleau (March, 1814); in spite of the\r\ndetermined opposition of Louis XVIII. she gained this right for herself\r\nowing largely to the support of the emperor Alexander, but she failed to\r\nmake good the claims of her son to the inheritance (see NAPOLEON II.).\r\nShe proceeded alone to Parma, where she fell more and more under the\r\ninfluence of the count von Neipperg, and had to acquiesce in the title\r\n\"duke of Reichstadt\" accorded to her son. Long before the tidings of the\r\ndeath of Napoleon at St Helena reached her she was living in intimate\r\nrelations with Neipperg at Parma, and bore a son to him not long after\r\nthat event. Napoleon on the other hand spoke of her in his will with\r\nmarked tenderness, and both excused and forgave her infidelity to him.\r\nThereafter Neipperg became her morganatic husband; and they had other\r\nchildren. In 1832, at the time of the last illness of the duke of\r\nReichstadt, she visited him at Vienna and was there at the time of his\r\ndeath; but in other respects she shook off all association with\r\nNapoleon. Her rule in Parma, conjointly with Neipperg, was characterized\r\nby a clemency and moderation which were lacking in the other Italian\r\nstates in that time of reaction. She preserved some of the Napoleonic\r\nlaws and institutions; in 1817 she established the equality of women in\r\nheritage, and ordered the compilation of a civil code which was\r\npromulgated in January 1820. The penal code of November 1821 abolished\r\nmany odious customs and punishments of the old code, and allowed\r\npublicity in criminal trials. On the death of Neipperg in 1829 his place\r\nwas taken by Baron Werklein, whose influence was hostile to popular\r\nliberty. During the popular movements of 1831 Marie Louise had to take\r\nrefuge with the Austrian garrison at Piacenza; on the restoration of her\r\nrule by the Austrians its character deteriorated, Parma becoming an\r\noutwork of the Austrian empire. She died at Vienna on the 18th of\r\nDecember 1847.\r\n\r\n  See _Correspondance de Marie Louise 1799-1847_ (Vienna, 1887); J. A.\r\n  Baron von Helfert, _Marie Louise_ (Vienna, 1873); E.

W. of Prague by rail. Pop.\r\n(1900), 4588. It is one of the most frequented watering-places of\r\nEurope, lying on the outskirts of the Kaiserwald at an altitude of 2093\r\nft., and is 40 m. S.W. of Carlsbad by rail. Marienbad is enclosed on all\r\nsides except the south by gently sloping hills clad with fragrant pine\r\nforests, which are intersected by lovely walks. The principal buildings\r\nare: the Roman Catholic church, which was completed in 1851; the English\r\nchurch, the theatre, the _Kurhaus_, built in 1901, and several bathing\r\nestablishments and hospitals. The mineral springs, which belong to the\r\nadjoining abbey of Tepl, are eight in number, and are used both for\r\nbathing and drinking, except the Marienquelle, which is used only for\r\nbathing. Some of them, like the Kreuzbrunnen and the Ferdinandsbrunnen,\r\ncontain alkaline-saline waters which resemble those of Carlsbad, except\r\nthat they are cold and contain nearly twice the quantity of purgative\r\nsalts. Others, like the Ambrosiusbrunnen and the Karolinenbrunnen, are\r\namong the strongest iron waters in the world, while the Rudolfsbrunnen\r\nis an earthy-alkaline spring. The waters are used in cases of liver\r\naffections, gout, diabetes and obesity; and the patients must conform\r\nduring the cure to a strictly regulated diet. Besides the mineral water\r\nbaths there are also _moor_ or mud-baths, and the peat used for these\r\nbaths is the richest in iron in the world. About 1,000,000 bottles of\r\nmineral water are exported annually.\r\n\r\nAmongst the places of interest round Marienbad is the basaltic rock of\r\nPodhorn (2776 ft.), situated about 3 m. to the east, from which an\r\nextensive view of the Böhmerwald, Fichtelgebirge and Erzgebirge is\r\nobtained. About 7 m. in the same direction lies the old and wealthy\r\nabbey of Tepl, founded in 1193. The actual building dates from the end\r\nof the 17th and the beginning of the 18th century, and contains a fine\r\nlibrary with a collection of rare manuscripts and incunabula; near it is\r\nthe small and old town of Tepl (pop. 2789). To the north-east of\r\nMarienbad lies the small watering-place of Königswart; near it is a\r\ncastle belonging since 1618 to the princes of Metternich, which contains\r\nan interesting museum, created by the famous Austrian statesman in the\r\nfirst part of the 19th century. It contains, besides a fine library, a\r\ncollection of the presents he received during his long career; numerous\r\nautographs, and other historical relics, a collection of rare coins,\r\narmour, portraits and various minerals.\r\n\r\nMarienbad is among the youngest of the Bohemian watering-places,\r\nalthough its springs were known from of old. They appear in a document\r\ndating from 1341, where they are called \"the Auschowitzer springs\r\nbelonging to the abbey of Tepl;\" but it was only through the efforts of\r\nDr Josef Nehr, the doctor of the abbey, who from 1779 until his death in\r\n1820 worked hard to demonstrate the curative properties of the springs,\r\nthat the waters began to be used for medicinal purposes. The place\r\nobtained its actual name of Marienbad in 1808; became a watering-place\r\nin 1818, and received its charter as a town in 1868.\r\n\r\n  See Lang, _Führer durch Marienbad und Umgebung_ (Marienbad, 1902); and\r\n  Kisch, Marienbad, seine Umgebung und Heilmittel (Marienbad, 1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIENBERG, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Saxony 16 m. S.E. of\r\nChemnitz on the Flöha-Reitzenhain railway. Pop. (1905), 7603. It has an\r\nEvangelical church, a Roman Catholic church, a non-commissioned\r\nofficers' school and a preparatory school; and the industries comprise\r\nwool-spinning, flax-dressing, the making of lace, toys and cigars, and\r\nsilver-mining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIENBURG (Polish, _Malborg_), a town of Germany, in the Prussian\r\nprovince of West Prussia, 30 m. by rail to the S.E. of Danzig in a\r\nfertile plain on the right bank of the Nogat, a channel of the Vistula,\r\nhere spanned by a handsome railway bridge and by a bridge of boats. Pop.\r\n(1905), 13,095. Marienburg contains large chemical wool-cleaning works\r\nand several other factories, carries on a considerable trade in grain,\r\nwood, linen, feathers and brushes, and is the seat of important cattle,\r\nhorse and wool markets. Its educational institutions include a gymnasium\r\nand a Protestant normal school. In the old market-place, many of the\r\nhouses in which are built with arcades, stands a Gothic town-hall,\r\ndating from the end of the 14th century. The town is also embellished\r\nwith a fine statue of Frederick the Great, who added this district to\r\nPrussia, and a monument commemorating the war of 1870-71. Marienburg is\r\nchiefly interesting from its having been for a century and a half the\r\nresidence of the grand masters of the Teutonic order. The large castle\r\nof the order here was originally founded in 1274 as the seat of a simple\r\ncommandery against the pagan Prussians, but in 1309 the headquarters of\r\nthe grand master were transferred hither from Venice, and the\r\n\"Marienburger Schloss\" soon became one of the largest and most strongly\r\nfortified buildings in Germany. On the decline of the order in the\r\nmiddle of the 15th century, the castle passed into the hands of the\r\nPoles, by whom it was allowed to fall into neglect and decay. It came\r\ninto the possession of Prussia in 1772, and was carefully restored at\r\nthe beginning of the 19th century. This interesting and curious building\r\nconsists of three parts, the Alt- or Hochschloss, the Mittelschloss, and\r\nthe Vorburg. It is built of brick, in a style of architecture peculiar\r\nto the Baltic provinces, and is undoubtedly one of the most important\r\nsecular buildings of the middle ages in Germany.\r\n\r\n  Of the numerous monographs published in Germany on the castle of\r\n  Marienburg, it will suffice to mention here Büsching's _Schloss der\r\n  deutschen Ritter zu Marienburg_ (Berlin, 1828); Voigt's _Geschichte\r\n  von Marienburg_ (Königsberg, 1824); Bergau's _Ordenshaupthaus\r\n  Marienburg_ (Berlin, 1871); and Steinbrecht, _Schloss Marienburg in\r\n  Preussen_ (8th ed., Berlin, 1905).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIENWERDER, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of West\r\nPrussia, 3 m. E. of the Vistula, 23 m. S. of Marienburg by rail. Pop.\r\n(1905), 10,258. The town was founded in the year 1233 by the Teutonic\r\norder. It has a cathedral of the same century, a triple Gothic edifice,\r\nrestored in 1874 and containing the tombs of several grand masters of\r\nthe Teutonic order; a (Gothic) town-hall (1880); a Roman Catholic\r\nbasilica (1858); a non-commissioned officers' school; a monument of the\r\nwar of 1870-71 (1897); an archaeological collection; and a seminary for\r\nfemale teachers. The industries include iron-foundries, saw-mills,\r\nsugar-refineries, breweries and printing-works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIE THÉRÈSE (1638-1683), queen consort of France, was born on the 10th\r\nof September 1638 at the Escurial, being the daughter of Philip IV. of\r\nSpain and Elizabeth of France. By pretending to seek a bride for his\r\nmaster in Margaret of Savoy, Mazarin had induced the king of Spain to\r\nmake proposals for the marriage of his daughter with Louis XIV., and the\r\ntreaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 stipulated for her marriage with the\r\nFrench king, Marie renouncing any claim to the Spanish succession. As\r\nthe treaty, however, hinged on the payment of her dowry, which was\r\npractically impossible for Spain, Mazarin could evade the other terms of\r\nthe contract. Marie Thérèse was married in June 1660, when Philip IV.\r\nwith his whole court accompanied the bride to the Isle of Pheasants in\r\nthe Bidassoa, where she was met by Louis. The new queen's amiability and\r\nher undoubted virtues failed to secure her husband's regard and\r\naffection. She saw herself neglected in turn for Louise de la Vallière,\r\nMme. de Montespan and others; but Marie Thérèse was too pious and too\r\nhumble openly to resent the position in which she was placed by the\r\nking's avowed infidelities. With the growing influence of Madame de\r\nMaintenon over his mind and affections he bestowed more attention on his\r\nwife, which she repaid by lavishing kindness on the mistress. She had no\r\npart in political affairs except in 1672, when she acted as regent\r\nduring Louis XIV.'s campaign in Holland. She died on the 30th of July\r\n1683 at Versailles, not without suspicion of foul play on the part of\r\nher doctors. Of her six children only one survived her, the dauphin\r\nLouis, who died in 1711.\r\n\r\n  See the funeral oration of Bossuet (Paris, 1684), E. Ducéré, _Le\r\n  Mariage de Louis XIV. d'après les contemporains et des documents\r\n  inédits_ (Bayonne, 1905); Dr Cabanès, _Les Morts mystérieuses de\r\n  l'histoire_ (1900), and the literature dealing with her rivals Louise\r\n  de la Vallière, Madame de Montespan and Madame de Maintenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIETTA, a city and the county-seat of Cobb county, Georgia, U.S.A., in\r\nthe N.W. of the state, about 17 m. N.W. of Atlanta. Pop. (1890), 3384;\r\n(1900), 4446, of whom 1928 were negroes; (1910), 5940. The city is\r\nserved by the Louisville & Nashville, the Nashville, Chattanooga & St.\r\nLouis, and the Western & Atlantic railways, and is connected with\r\nAtlanta by an electric line. Marietta is situated about 1118 ft. above\r\nthe sea, has a good climate, and is both a summer and a winter resort.\r\nThe principal industries are the manufacture of chairs and paper, and\r\nthe preparation of marble for the markets; there are also locomotive\r\nworks, planing mills, a canning factory, a knitting mill, &c. At\r\nMarietta there is a national cemetery, in which more than 10,000 Federal\r\nsoldiers are buried, and at Kenesaw Mountain (1809 ft.), about 2½ m.\r\nwest of the city, one of the fiercest battles of the Civil War was\r\nfought. After the Confederate retreat from Dalton in May 1864, General\r\nWilliam T. Sherman, the Federal commander, made Marietta his next\r\nintermediate point in his Atlanta campaign, and the Confederate\r\ncommander, General Joseph E. Johnston, established a line of defence\r\nwest of the town. After several preliminary engagements Sherman on the\r\n26th and 27th of June made repeated unsuccessful attempts to drive the\r\nConfederates from their defences at Kenesaw Mountain; he then resorted\r\nto a flanking movement which forced the Confederate general to retire\r\n(July 2) toward Atlanta. Marietta was settled about 1840, and was\r\nchartered as a city in 1852.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIETTA, a city and the county-seat of Washington county, Ohio, U.S.A.,\r\non the Ohio River, at the mouth of the Muskingum, about 115 m. S.E. of\r\nColumbus. Pop. (1890), 8273; (1900), 13,348, including 679 foreign-born\r\nand 361 negroes; (1910), 12,923. It is served by the Pennsylvania\r\n(Marietta Division), the Baltimore & Ohio (Marietta & Parkersburg,\r\nMarietta & Zanesville, and Ohio River divisions) and the Marietta,\r\nColumbus & Cleveland railways, and by steamboat lines to several river\r\nports; a bridge across the Ohio connects it with Williamstown, West\r\nVirginia. The city is in a hilly country of much natural beauty, and is\r\nof considerable historic interest. On the banks of the Muskingum is a\r\npublic park, facing which stood the oldest church in the state; this was\r\nburned in 1905, but was subsequently rebuilt in the old style. Near by\r\nare some 18th century buildings, some interesting earthworks of the\r\n\"mound-builders,\" and a cemetery in which are buried many soldiers who\r\nfought in the War of Independence. Marietta is the seat of Marietta\r\nCollege, dating from 1830, which in 1908 had more than 500 students. It\r\npossesses a library of 60,000 volumes, including some rare collections,\r\nespecially the Stimson collection of books bearing on the history of the\r\nNorth-West Territory. Petroleum, coal, and iron-ore abound in the\r\nneighbouring region, and the city has a considerable trade in these and\r\nin its manufactures of chairs, leather, flour, carriages, wagons, boats,\r\nboilers, bricks and glass. In 1905 the factory products were valued at\r\n$2,599,287.\r\n\r\nMarietta, named in honour of Marie Antoinette, is the oldest settlement\r\nin the state and in the North-west Territory. It was founded in 1788 by\r\na company of Revolutionary officers from New England under the\r\nleadership of General Rufus Putnam, and in the same year the North-West\r\nTerritory was formally organized here. The pseudo-classicism of the\r\nperiod of Marietta's foundation is indicated by the names--_Capitolium_\r\nfor one of the public squares, _Sacra Via_ for one of the principal\r\nstreets, and _Campus Martius_ for the fortification. The settlement was\r\nincorporated as a town in 1800 and chartered as a city in 1852. In 1800\r\nthe village of Harmar, including the site on which Fort Harmar was built\r\nin 1785, was annexed.\r\n\r\n  See Henry Howe, _Historical Collections of Ohio_ (Columbus, 1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIETTE, AUGUSTE FERDINAND FRANÇOIS (1821-1881), French Egyptologist,\r\nwas born on the 11th of February 1821 at Boulogne, where his father was\r\ntown clerk. Educated at the Boulogne municipal college, where he\r\ndistinguished himself and showed much artistic talent, he went to\r\nEngland in 1839 when eighteen as professor of French and drawing at a\r\nboys' school at Stratford-on-Avon. In 1840 he became pattern-designer to\r\na ribbon manufacturer at Coventry; but weary of ill-paid exile he\r\nreturned the same year to Boulogne, and in 1841 took his degree at\r\nDouai. He now became a professor at his old college, and for some years\r\nsupplemented his salary by giving private lessons and writing on\r\nhistorical and archaeological subjects for local periodicals. Meanwhile\r\nhis cousin Nestor L'Hôte, the friend and fellow-traveller of\r\nChampollion, died, and upon Mariette devolved the task of sorting the\r\npapers of the deceased savant. He thenceforth became passionately\r\ninterested in Egyptology, devoted himself to the study of hieroglyphs\r\nand Coptic, and in 1847 published a _Catalogue analytique_ of the\r\nEgyptian Gallery of the Boulogne Museum; in 1849, being appointed to a\r\nsubordinate position in the Louvre, he left Boulogne for Paris.\r\nEntrusted with a government mission for the purpose of seeking and\r\npurchasing Coptic, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic MSS. for the national\r\ncollection, he started for Egypt in 1850; and soon after his arrival he\r\nmade his celebrated discovery of the ruins of the Serapeum and the\r\nsubterraneous catacombs of the Apisbulls. His original mission being\r\nabandoned, funds were now advanced for the prosecution of his\r\nresearches, and he remained in Egypt for four years, excavating,\r\ndiscovering and despatching archaeological treasures to the Louvre, of\r\nwhich museum he was on his return appointed an assistant conservator. In\r\n1858 he accepted the position of conservator of Egyptian monuments to\r\nthe ex-khedive, Ismail Pasha, and removed with his family to Cairo. His\r\nhistory thenceforth becomes a chronicle of unwearied exploration and\r\nbrilliant success. The museum at Bula was founded immediately. The\r\npyramid-fields of Memphis and Sakkara, and the necropolis of Meydum, and\r\nthose of Abydos and Thebes were examined; the great temples of Dendera\r\nand Edfu were disinterred; important excavations were carried out at\r\nKarnak, Medinet-Habu and Deir el-Bahri; Tanis (the Zoan of the Bible)\r\nwas partially explored in the Delta; and even Gebel Barkal in the Sudan.\r\nThe Sphinx was bared to the rock-level, and the famous granite and\r\nalabaster monument miscalled the \"Temple of the Sphinx\" was discovered.\r\nMariette was raised successively to the rank of bey and pasha in his own\r\nservice. Honours and orders were showered on him: the Legion of Honour\r\nand the Medjidie in 1852; the Red Eagle (first class) of Prussia in\r\n1855; the Italian order of SS. Maurice and Lazarus in 1857; and the\r\nAustrian order of Francis-Joseph in 1858. In 1873 the Academy of\r\nInscriptions decreed to him the biennial prize of 20,000 francs, and in\r\n1878 he was elected a member of the Institute. He was also an honorary\r\nmember of most of the learned societies of Europe. In 1877 his health\r\nbroke down through overwork. He lingered for a few years, working to the\r\nlast, and died at Cairo on the 19th of January 1881.\r\n\r\n  His chief published works are: _Le Sérapéum de Memphis_ (1857 and\r\n  following years); _Dendérah_, five folios and one 4to (1873-1875);\r\n  _Abydos_, two folios and one 4to (1870-1880); _Karnak_, folio and 4to\r\n  (1875); _Deir el-Bahari_, folio and 4to (1877); _Listes géographiques\r\n  des pylônes de Karnak_, folio (1875); _Catalogue du Musée de Boulaq_\r\n  (six editions 1864-1876); _Aperçu de l'histoire d'Égypte_ (four\r\n  editions, 1864-1874, &c.); _Les Mastabas de l'ancien empire_ (edited\r\n  by Maspero) (1883).

EGYPT:\r\n  _Exploration and Research_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIGNAC, JEAN CHARLES GALISSARD DE (1817-1894), Swiss chemist, was born\r\nat Geneva on the 24th of April 1817. When sixteen years old he began to\r\nattend the École Polytechnique in Paris, and from 1837 to 1839 studied\r\nat the École des Mines. Then, after a short time in Liebig's laboratory\r\nat Giessen, and in the Sèvres porcelain factory, he became in 1841\r\nprofessor of chemistry in the academy of Geneva. In 1845 he was\r\nappointed professor of mineralogy also, and held both chairs till 1878,\r\nwhen ill-health obliged him to resign. He died at Geneva on the 15th of\r\nApril 1894. Marignac's name is well known for the careful and exact\r\ndeterminations of atomic weights which he carried out for twenty-eight\r\nof the elements. In undertaking this work he had, like J. S. Stas, the\r\npurpose of testing Prout's hypothesis, but he remained more disposed\r\nthan the Belgian chemist to consider the possibility that it may have\r\nsome degree of validity. Throughout his life he paid great attention to\r\nthe \"rare earths\" and the problem of separating and distinguishing them;\r\nin 1878 he extracted ytterbia from what was supposed to be pure erbia,\r\nand two years later found gadolinia and samaria in the samarskite\r\nearths. In 1858 he pointed out the isomorphism of the fluostannates and\r\nthe fluosilicates, thus settling the then vexed question of the\r\ncomposition of silicic acid; and subsequently he studied the fluosalts\r\nof zirconium, boron, tungsten, &c., and prepared silicotungstic acid,\r\none of the first examples of the complex inorganic acids. In physical\r\nchemistry he carried out many researches on the nature and process of\r\nsolution, investigating in particular the thermal effects produced by\r\nthe dilution of saline solutions, the variation of the specific heat of\r\nsaline solutions with temperature and concentration, and the phenomena\r\nof liquid diffusion.\r\n\r\n  A memorial lecture by P. T. Cleve, printed in the _Journal of the\r\n  London Chemical Society_ for 1895, contains a list of Marignac's\r\n  papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIGNAN, BATTLE OF, fought on the 13th and 14th of September 1515\r\nbetween the French army under Francis I. and the Swiss. The scene of the\r\nbattle--which was also that of a hard fought engagement in 1859 (see\r\nITALIAN WARS)--was the northern outskirts of the village of Melegnano,\r\non the river Lambro, 10 m. S.E. of Milan. The circumstances out of which\r\nthe battle of Marignan arose, almost inconceivable to the modern mind,\r\nwere not abnormal in the conditions of Italian warfare and politics then\r\nprevailing. The young king of France had gathered an army about Lyons,\r\nwherewith to overrun the Milanese; his allies were the republics of\r\nVenice and Genoa. The duke of Milan, Maximilian Sforza, had secured the\r\nsupport of the emperor, the king of Spain, and the pope, and also that\r\nof the Swiss cantons, which then supplied the best and most numerous\r\nmercenary soldiers in Europe. The practicable passes of the Alps and the\r\nApennines were held by Swiss and papal troops. Francis however boldly\r\ncrossed the Col de l'Argentière (Aug. 1515) by paths that no army had\r\nhitherto used, and Marshal de La Palisse surprised and captured a papal\r\ncorps at Villafranca near Pinerolo, whereupon the whole of the enemy's\r\ntroops fell back on Milan. The king then marching by Vercelli, Novara\r\nand Pavia, joined hands with Alviano, the Venetian commander, and\r\nsecured a foothold in the Milanese. But in order to avoid the necessity\r\nof besieging Milan itself, he offered the Swiss a large sum to retire\r\ninto their own country. They were about to accept his offer, not having\r\nreceived their subsidies from the pope and the king of Spain, when a\r\nfresh corps of mercenaries descended into Italy, desirous both of\r\ngaining booty and of showing their prowess against their new rivals the\r\nFrench and Lower Rhine \"lansquenets\" (Landsknechts) and against the\r\nFrench gendarmerie, whom (alluding to the \"Battle of the Spurs\" at\r\nGuinegatte in 1513) they called \"hares in armour.\" The French took\r\nposition at Melegnano to face the Swiss, the Venetians at Lodi to hold\r\nin check the Spanish army at Piacenza. Alviano, who was visiting the\r\nking when the Swiss appeared before Melegnano, hurried off to bring\r\nthither his own army. Meantime the French and the Swiss engaged in an\r\nincredibly fierce struggle.\r\n\r\nThe king's army was grouped in front of the village, facing in the\r\ndirection of Milan, with a small stream separating it from the oncoming\r\nSwiss. On either side of the Milan road was a large body of\r\nlandsknechts, a third being in reserve. The French and Gascon infantry\r\n(largely armed with arquebuses) was on the extreme right, the various\r\nbodies of gendarmerie in the centre. In front of all was the French\r\nartillery. The battle opened in the afternoon of the 13th of September.\r\nAs the Swiss advanced in three huge columns, the French guns fired into\r\nthem with terrible effect, but the assailants reached the intersected\r\nground bordering the stream, and thus protected from the rush of the\r\nFrench gendarmerie, they debouched on the other side, and fell upon the\r\nlandsknechts. The crowd of combatants, the gathering darkness, and the\r\ndust, prevented any general direction being given to the battle by the\r\nleaders of either side. Francis himself at the head of two hundred\r\ngendarmes charged and drove back two large bodies of Swiss which were\r\npressing the landsknechts hard. The battle went on by moonlight till\r\nclose on midnight, when the Swiss retired a short distance. Both sides\r\nspent the rest of the night on the battlefield, reorganizing their\r\nbroken corps. Francis and his gendarmes were the outpost line of the\r\nFrench army, and remained all night mounted, lance in hand and helmet on\r\nhead. Next morning at sunrise, the battle was renewed. The Swiss now\r\nleft their centre inactive opposite the king and with two strong corps\r\nattempted to work round his flanks. That on the left made for the French\r\nbaggage, but found it strongly guarded by landsknechts, who drove them\r\nback. The nearest French gendarmerie joined in the pursuit, but a\r\ndetachment from the Swiss centre fell upon these and destroyed them.\r\nThis detachment in turn followed up its advantage until as Francis\r\nhimself expressed it, \"the whole camp turned out\" to aid the\r\nlandsknechts and \"hunted out\" the Swiss. Meantime the Swiss left attack\r\nhad closed with the French infantry bands and the \"aventuriers\"\r\n(afterwards the famous corps of Picardie and Piedmont), who were\r\ncommanded on this day by the famous engineer Pedro Navarro. It was in\r\nthe main struggle of arquebus against pike, but it was not the arquebus\r\nalone, or even principally, that gave the victory to the French. When\r\nthe Swiss ranks had been disordered, the short pike and the sword came\r\ninto play, and aided by the constable de Bourbon with a handful of the\r\ngendarmerie, the French right more than held its own until Alviano with\r\nthe cavalry from Lodi rode on to the field and completed the rout of the\r\nSwiss. In the centre meanwhile the two infantries stood fast for eight\r\nhours, separated by the brook, while the artillery on both sides fired\r\ninto it at short range. But the landsknechts, animated by the king,\r\nendured it as well as the Swiss; and at the last, Francis leading a\r\nfinal advance of his exhausted troops, the Swiss gave way and fled. Only\r\n3000 Swiss escaped out of some 25,000 who fought. On the French side\r\nprobably 8000 were killed or died of wounds. The battle lasted\r\ntwenty-eight hours. Its tactical lesson was the efficacy of combining\r\ntwo arms against one. The French gendarmerie, burning to avenge the\r\ninsult of \"hares in armour,\" made more than thirty charges by squadrons,\r\nand they were admirably supported by their light artillery. The\r\nlandsknechts retrieved their first day's defeat by their conduct on the\r\nsecond day. Nevertheless Marignan was in the main the work of the\r\ngendarmerie, the last and greatest triumph of the armoured lancer; and\r\nas a fitting close to the battle the young king was knighted by Bayard\r\non the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIGNOLLI, GIOVANNI DE', a notable traveller to the Far East in the\r\n14th century, born probably before 1290, and sprung from a noble family\r\nin Florence. The family is long extinct, but a street near the cathedral\r\n(Via de' Cerretani) formerly bore the name of the Marignolli. In 1338\r\nthere arrived at Avignon, where Benedict XII. held his court, an embassy\r\nfrom the great khan of Cathay (the Mongol-Chinese emperor), bearing\r\nletters to the pontiff from the khan himself, and from certain Christian\r\nnobles of the Alan race in his service. These latter represented that\r\nthey had been eight years (since Monte Corvino's death) without a\r\nspiritual guide, and earnestly desired one. The pope replied to the\r\nletters, and appointed four ecclesiastics as his legates to the khan's\r\ncourt. The name of John of Florence, i.e. Marignolli, appears third on\r\nthe letters of commission. A large party was associated with the four\r\nchief envoys; when in Peking the embassy still numbered thirty-two, out\r\nof an original fifty.\r\n\r\nThe mission left Avignon in December 1338; picked up the Tatar envoys at\r\nNaples; stayed nearly two months in Constantinople (Pera, May 1-June 24,\r\n1339); and sailed across the Black Sea to Kaffa, whence they travelled\r\nto the court of Mahommed Uzbeg, khan of the Golden Horde, at Sarai on\r\nthe Volga. The khan entertained them hospitably during the winter of\r\n1339-1340 and then sent them across the steppes to Armalec, Almalig or\r\nAlmaligh (Kulja), the northern seat of the house of Chaghatai, in what\r\nis now the province of Ili. \"There,\" says Marignolli, \"we built a\r\nchurch, bought a piece of ground ... sung masses, and baptized several\r\npersons, notwithstanding that only the year before the bishop and six\r\nother minor friars had there undergone glorious martyrdom for Christ's\r\nsalvation.\" Quitting Almaligh in 1341, they seem to have reached Peking\r\n(by way of Kamul or Hami) in May or June 1342. They were well received\r\nby the reigning khan, the last of the Mongol dynasty in China. An entry\r\nin the Chinese annals fixes the year of Marignolli's presentation by its\r\nmention of the arrival of the great horses from the kingdom of Fulang\r\n(_Farang_ or Europe), one of which was 11 ft. 6 in. in length, and 6 ft.\r\n8 in. high, and black all over.\r\n\r\nMarignolli stayed at Peking or Cambalec three or four years, after which\r\nhe travelled through eastern China to Zayton or Amoy Harbour, quitting\r\nChina apparently in December 1347, and reaching Columbum (Kaulam or\r\nQuilon in Malabar) in Easter week of 1348. At this place he found a\r\nchurch of the Latin communion, probably founded by Jordanus of Séverac,\r\nwho had been appointed bishop of Columbum by Pope John XXII. in 1330.\r\nHere Marignolli remained sixteen months, after which he proceeded on\r\nwhat seems a most devious voyage. First he visited the shrine of St\r\nThomas near the modern Madras, and then proceeded to what he calls the\r\nkingdom of Saba, and identifies with the Sheba of Scripture, but which\r\nseems from various particulars to have been Java. Taking ship again for\r\nMalabar on his way to Europe, he encountered great storms. They found\r\nshelter in the little port of _Pervily_ or _Pervilis_ (Beruwala or\r\nBerberyn) in the south-west of Ceylon; but here the legate fell into the\r\nhands of \"a certain tyrant Coya Jaan (Khoja Jahan), a eunuch and an\r\naccursed Saracen,\" who professed to treat him with all deference, but\r\ndetained him four months, and plundered all the gifts and Eastern\r\nrarities that he was carrying home. This detention in _Seyllan_ enables\r\nMarignolli to give a variety of curious particulars regarding Adam's\r\nPeak, Buddhist monasticism, the aboriginal races of Ceylon, and other\r\nmarvels. After this we have only fragmentary notices, showing that his\r\nroute to Europe lay by Ormuz, the ruins of Babel, Bagdad, Mosul, Aleppo\r\nand thence to Damascus and Jerusalem. In 1353 he arrived at Avignon, and\r\ndelivered a letter from the great khan to Pope Innocent VI. In the\r\nfollowing year the emperor Charles IV., on a visit to Italy, made\r\nMarignolli one of his chaplains. Soon after, the pope made him bishop of\r\nBisignano; but he seems to have been in no hurry to reside there. He\r\nappears to have accompanied the emperor to Prague in 1354-1355; in 1356\r\nhe is found acting as envoy to the Pope from Florence; and in 1357 he is\r\nat Bologna. We know not when he died. The last trace of Marignolli is a\r\nletter addressed to him, which was found in the 18th century among the\r\nrecords in the Chapter Library at Prague. The writer is an unnamed\r\nbishop of Armagh, easily identified with Richard Fitz Ralph, a strenuous\r\nfoe of the Franciscans, who had broken lances in controversy with Ockham\r\nand Burley. The letter implies that some intention had been intimated\r\nfrom Avignon of sending Marignolli to Ireland in connexion with matters\r\nthen in debate--a project which stirs Fitz Ralph's wrath.\r\n\r\n  The fragmentary notes of Marignolli's Eastern travels often contain\r\n  vivid remembrance and graphic description, but combined with an\r\n  incontinent vanity, and an incoherent lapse from one thing to another.\r\n  They have no claim to be called a narrative, and it is with no small\r\n  pains that anything like a narrative can be pieced out of them. Indeed\r\n  the mode in which they were elicited curiously illustrates how little\r\n  medieval travellers thought of publication The emperor Charles,\r\n  instead of urging his chaplain to write a history of his vast\r\n  journeys, set him to the repugnant task of recasting the annals of\r\n  Bohemia; and he consoled himself by salting the insipid stuff by\r\n  interpolations, _à propos de bottes_, of his recollections of Asiatic\r\n  travel.\r\n\r\n  Nobody seems to have noticed the work till 1768, when the chronicle\r\n  was published in vol. ii. of the _Monumenta hist. Bohemiae nusquam\r\n  antehac edita_ by Father Gelasius Dobner. But, though Marignolli was\r\n  thus at last in type, no one seems to have read him till 1820, when an\r\n  interesting paper on his travels was published by J. G. Meinert.\r\n  Professor Friedrich Kunstmann of Munich also devoted to the subject\r\n  one of his admirable series of papers on the ecclesiastical travellers\r\n  of the middle ages.\r\n\r\n  See _Fontes rerum bohemicarum_, iii. 492-604 (1882, best text); G.\r\n  Dobner's _Monumenta hist. boh._, vol. ii.

B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIGNY, ENGUERRAND DE (1260-1315), French chamberlain, and minister of\r\nPhilip IV. the Fair, was born at Lyons-la-Forêt in Normandy, of an old\r\nNorman family of the smaller baronage called Le Portier, which took the\r\nname of Marigny about 1200. Enguerrand entered the service of Hugues de\r\nBonville, chamberlain and secretary of Philip IV., as a squire, and then\r\nwas attached to the household of Queen Jeanne, who made him one of the\r\nexecutors of her will. He married her god-daughter, Jeanne de St Martin.\r\nIn 1298 he received the custody of the castle of Issoudun. After the\r\ndeath of Pierre Flotte and Hugues de Bonville at the battle of\r\nMons-en-Pevèle in 1304, he became Philip's grand chamberlain and chief\r\nminister. In 1306 he was sent to preside over the exchequer of Normandy.\r\nHe received numerous gifts of land and money from Philip as well as a\r\npension from Edward II. of England. Possessed of an ingratiating manner,\r\npolitic, learned and astute, he acted as an able instrument in carrying\r\nout Philip's plans, and received corresponding confidence. He shared the\r\npopular odium which Philip incurred by debasing the coinage. He acted as\r\nthe agent of Philip in his contest with Louis de Nevers, the son of\r\nRobert count of Flanders, imprisoning Louis and forcing Robert to\r\nsurrender Lille, Douay and Béthune. He obtained for his half-brother\r\nPhilip de Marigny in 1301 the bishopric of Cambray, and in 1309 the\r\narchbishopric of Sens, and for his brother Jean in 1312 the bishopric of\r\nBeauvais. Still another relative, Nicolas de Fréauville, became the\r\nking's confessor and a cardinal. He addressed the estates general in\r\n1314 and succeeded in getting further taxes for the Flemish war,\r\nincurring at the same time much ill will. This soon came to a head when\r\nthe princes of the blood, eager to fight the Flemings, were disappointed\r\nby his negotiating a peace in September. He was accused of receiving\r\nbribes, and Charles of Valois denounced him to the king himself; but\r\nPhilip stood by him and the attack was of no avail. The death of Philip\r\nIV. on the 29th of November 1314 was a signal for a reaction against his\r\npolicy. The feudal party, whose power the king had tried to limit,\r\nturned on his ministers and chiefly on his chamberlain. Enguerrand was\r\narrested by Louis X. at the instigation of Charles of Valois, and\r\ntwenty-eight articles of accusation including charges of receiving\r\nbribes were brought against him. He was refused a hearing; but his\r\naccounts were correct, and Louis was inclined to spare him anything more\r\nthan banishment to the island of Cyprus. Charles then brought forward a\r\ncharge of sorcery which was more effectual. He was condemned at once and\r\nhanged on the public gallows at Montfaucon, protesting that in all his\r\nacts he had only been carrying out Philip's commands (April 30, 1315).\r\nLouis X. seems to have repented of his treatment of Marigny, and left\r\nlegacies to his children. When his chief enemy, Charles of Valois, lay\r\ndying in 1325, he was stricken with remorse and ordered alms to be\r\ndistributed among the poor of Paris with a request to \"pray for the\r\nsouls of Enguerrand and Charles.\" Marigny founded the collegiate church\r\nof Notre Dame d'Escoës near Rouen in 1313. He was twice married, first\r\nto Jeanne de St Martin, by whom he had three children, Louis, Marie and\r\nIsabelle (who married Robert, son of Robert de Tancarville); and the\r\nsecond time to Alips de Mons.\r\n\r\n  See contemporary chroniclers in vols. xx. to xxiii. of D. Bouquet,\r\n  _Historiens de la France_; P. Clément, _Trois drames historiques_\r\n  (Paris, 1857); Ch. Dufayard, _La Réaction féodale sous les fils de\r\n  Philippe le Bel_, in the _Revue historique_ (1894, liv. 241-272) and\r\n  lv. 241-290.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIGNY, JEAN DE (d. 1350), French bishop, was a younger brother of the\r\npreceding. Entering the church at an early age, he was rapidly advanced\r\nuntil in 1313 he was made bishop of Beauvais. During the next twenty\r\nyears he was one of the most notable of the members of the French\r\nepiscopate, and was particularly in favour with King Philip VI. He\r\ndevoted himself in 1335 to the completion of the choir of Beauvais\r\nCathedral, the enormous windows of which were filled with the richest\r\nglass. But this building activity, which has left one of the most\r\nnotable Gothic monuments in Europe, was broken into by the Hundred\r\nYears' War. Jean de Marigny, a successful administrator and man of\r\naffairs rather than a saintly churchman, was made one of the king's\r\nlieutenants in southern France in 1341 against the English invasion. His\r\nmost important military operation, however, was when in 1346 he\r\nsuccessfully held out in Beauvais against a siege by the English, who\r\nhad overrun the country up to the walls of the city. Created archbishop\r\nof Rouen in 1347 as a reward for this defence, he enjoyed his new\r\nhonours only three years; he died on the 26th of December 1350.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIGOLD. This name has been given to several plants, of which the\r\nfollowing are the best known: _Calendula officinalis_, the pot-marigold;\r\n_Tagetes erecta_, the African marigold; _T. patula_, the French\r\nmarigold; and _Chrysanthemum segetum_, the corn marigold. All these\r\nbelong to the order Compositae; but _Caltha palustris_, the marsh\r\nmarigold, belongs to the order Ranunculaceae.\r\n\r\nThe first-mentioned is the familiar garden plant with large\r\norange-coloured blossoms, and is probably not known in a wild state.\r\nThere are now many fine garden varieties of it. The florets are\r\nunisexual, the \"ray\" florets being female, the \"disk\" florets male. This\r\nand the double variety have been in cultivation for at least three\r\nhundred years, as well as a proliferous form, _C. prolifera_, or the\r\n\"fruitful marigolde\" of Gerard (_Herball_, p. 602), in which small\r\nflower-heads proceed from beneath the circumference of the flower. The\r\nfigure of \"the greatest double marigold,\" _C. multiflora maxima_, given\r\nby Gerard (loc. cit. p. 600) is larger than most specimens now seen,\r\nbeing 3 in. in diameter. He remarks of \"the marigolde\" that it is called\r\n_Calendula_ \"as it is to be seene to flower in the calends of almost\r\neuerie moneth.\" It was supposed to have several specific virtues, but\r\nthey are non-existent. \"The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun,\" is\r\nmentioned by Shakespeare, _Winter's Tale_, iv. 3.\r\n\r\n_Tagetes patula_, and _T. erecta_, the French and African marigolds, are\r\nnatives of Mexico, and are equally familiar garden plants, having been\r\nlong in cultivation. Gerard figures five varieties of _Flos africanus_,\r\nof the single and double kind (loc. cit., p. 609). Besides the above\r\nspecies the following have been introduced later, _T. lucida_, _T.\r\nsignata_, also from Mexico, and _T. tenuifolia_ from Peru.\r\n\r\n_Chrysanthemum segetum_, the yellow corn marigold, is indigenous to\r\nGreat Britain, and is frequent in corn-fields in most parts of England.\r\nWhen dried it has been employed as hay. It is also used in Germany for\r\ndyeing yellow. Gerard observes that in his day \"the stalke and leaues of\r\nCorne Marigolde, as Dioscorides saith, are eaten as other potherbes\r\nare.\"\r\n\r\n_Caltha palustris_, the marsh marigold, or king-cups, the \"winking\r\nMary-buds\" of Shakespeare (_Cymb._, ii. 3), is a common British plant in\r\nmarshy meadows and beside water. It bears smooth heart-shaped leaves,\r\nand flowers with a golden yellow calyx but no corolla, blossoming in\r\nMarch and April. The flower-buds preserved in salted vinegar are a good\r\nsubstitute for capers. A double-flowered variety is often cultivated,\r\nand is occasionally found wild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIINSK, a town of Russia, in West Siberia and the government of Tomsk,\r\non the bank of the Kiya river and on the Siberian railway, 147 m. E.S.E.\r\nof Tomsk. Pop. (1897), 8300. It is built of timber, but has a stately\r\ncathedral. There are tanneries and soapworks; and Mariinsk is an\r\nentrepôt for the goldmines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARILLAC, CHARLES DE (c. 1510-1560), French prelate and diplomatist,\r\ncame of a good family of Auvergne, and at the age of twenty-two was\r\nadvocate at the parlement of Paris. Suspected, however, of sympathizing\r\nwith the reformers, he deemed it prudent to leave Paris, and in 1535\r\nwent to the East with his cousin Jean de la Forêt, the first French\r\nambassador at Constantinople. Cunning and ambitious, he soon made his\r\nmark, and his cousin having died during his embassy, Marillac was\r\nappointed his successor. He did not return from the East until 1538,\r\nwhen he was sent almost immediately to England, where he remained\r\nambassador until 1543. He retained his influence during the reign of\r\nHenry II., fulfilling important missions in Switzerland and at the\r\nimperial court (1547-1551), and at the courts of the German princes\r\n(1553-1554). In 1555 he was one of the French deputies at the\r\nconferences held at Mark near Ardres to discuss peace with England. His\r\ntwo last missions were at Rome (1557) and at the Diet of Augsburg\r\n(1559). In 1550 he was given the bishopric of Vannes, and in 1557 the\r\narchbishopric of Vienne; he also became a member of the privy council.\r\nHe distinguished himself as a statesman at the Assembly of Notables at\r\nFontainebleau in 1560, when he delivered an exceedingly brilliant\r\ndiscourse, in which he opposed the policy of violence and demanded a\r\nnational council and the assembly of the states general. Irritated by\r\nhis opposition, the Guises compelled him to leave the court, and he died\r\non the 2nd of December of the same year.\r\n\r\n  His works include: _Discours sur la roupture de la Trefve en l'an\r\n  1556_ (Paris, 1556), and \"Sommaire de l'ambassade en Allemagne de feu\r\n  M^r. l'archévesque de Vienne en l'an 1550,\" published in Ranke's\r\n  _Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter der Reformation_, vol. vi. (Leipzig,\r\n  1882). See J. Kaulek, _Correspondance politique de Castillon et\r\n  Marillac (1537-1542)_ (Paris, 1885); P. de Vassière, _Charles de\r\n  Marillac_ (Paris, 1896).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINES (from Lat. _mare_, sea), the technical term for sea-soldiers,\r\ni.e. troops appropriated and specially adapted to the requirements of\r\nmaritime war. This force--formerly (1694) styled \"mariners\"--is in\r\norigin, use and application peculiarly British. The only other nation\r\npossessing a special force discharging exactly similar functions is the\r\nUnited States (see below). In the armed forces of the great European\r\nPowers marines and marine artillery are mentioned, but these troops have\r\nlittle in common with British and American marines. In France their\r\nduties are to garrison military forts and colonies and take part in\r\nmarine and other wars. In Germany they are used for coast defence. In\r\nHolland, Austria and Italy they have a military organization, but not as\r\ncomplements of sea-going ships.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the British marine force was an order in council 1664,\r\ndirecting \"1200 Land souldgers to be forthwith rayzed to be in readiness\r\nto be distributed in His Majesty's fleete prepared for sea service.\"\r\nThis body was named the \"Admiral's regiment.\" At this period land\r\nwarfare had developed a system and was waged by men organized,\r\ndisciplined and trained. Sea warfare was left \"to every man's own\r\nconceit.\" War-ships were built to be manned in a hurry, by \"the press,\"\r\nwhen needed. Men were thus obtained by force and grouped without\r\norganization or previous training in ships. When no longer required they\r\nwere turned adrift. The administration of England's fleet was \"a prodigy\r\nof wastefulness, corruption and indolence; no estimate could be trusted,\r\nno contract was performed, no check was enforced.\" Such officers as had\r\nbeen \"bred to the sea seemed a strange and savage race.\" They robbed the\r\nking and cheated the seamen. As regards land force, it was a violation\r\nof the law to keep at home in the king's pay \"any other body of armed\r\nmen, save as a guard for the royal person.\" On the other hand it was\r\n\"illegal to land press men\" in a foreign country, but soldiers \"only\r\nrequired a little persuasion to land.\" Thus by thrusting into naval\r\nchaos and confusion a nucleus of disciplined, trained and organized\r\nland troops, an expedient was found which offered a solution of the many\r\npolitical and administrative difficulties of the time. This \"Admiral's\r\nregiment.\" was the germ which by a constant process of evolution during\r\na period of over 235 years has produced not merely the marine forces,\r\nbut the royal navy, organized, disciplined and trained as it is to-day.\r\nIn 1668 the experiment of the Admiral's regiment was extended. At a\r\ncouncil held \"to discourse about the fitness for entering men presently\r\nfor manning the fleete,\" King Charles II. \"cried very civilly, 'If ever\r\nyou intend to man the fleet without being cheated by the captains and\r\npursers, you may go to bed and resolve never to have it manned.'\" This\r\nseems to throw some light on the council's order a few days later \"to\r\ndraw out and furnish such numbers of His Majesty's Foot Guards for His\r\nMajesty's service at sea this summer, as H.R.H. the duke of York, lord\r\nhigh admiral of England, shall from time to time desire.\" The men were\r\nto be paid and accounted for by their own officers. This maritime force\r\nsubsequently disappeared, but two new regiments of \"marines\" were raised\r\nin 1694, the House of Commons directing they \"were to be employed in the\r\nservice of the navy only.\" One regiment only was to be on shore at a\r\ntime, and to be employed in the dockyards with extra pay. None of the\r\nofficers were to be sea commanders, save two colonels. The intention was\r\nto make these regiments feeders for the navy, captains being ordered to\r\nreport periodically \"the names of such soldiers as shall in any measure\r\nbe made seamen, and how far each of them is qualified toward being an\r\nable seaman.\" In 1697 these regiments were disbanded, but early in the\r\nreign of Queen Anne a number of regiments of marines were raised, and\r\nindependent companies of marines were also enlisted in the West Indies.\r\nAt the peace of Utrecht (1713) the marines were disbanded, but\r\nreappeared in 1739 as part of the army; and in 1740 three regiments of\r\nmarines were raised in America, the colonels being appointed by the\r\ncrown, the captains by the provinces. In 1747 the marine regiments were\r\ntransferred from the control of the secretary at war to that of the\r\nadmiralty, and the next year once more wholly disappeared on the treaty\r\nof Aix-la-Chapelle (1748).\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding period of fifty-four years the marine force\r\nappeared and disappeared with war. It was a military body, applied to\r\nnaval purposes. Its main functions were three-fold--(1) for fighting in\r\nships; (2) for seizing and holding land positions necessary or\r\nadvantageous to the naval operations of war; (3) for maintaining\r\ndiscipline of the ships, and by \"expertness in handling arms to incite\r\nour seamen to the imitation of them.\" Incidentally the force came to be\r\nregarded as so good a feeder for the navy that Admiral Vernon (1739)\r\nurged \"the necessity of converting most of our marching regiments into\r\nmarines, and if, as they became seamen they were admitted to be\r\ndischarged as such, that would make a good nursery for the breeding of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nThe organization of the force was purely military. Regiments were\r\nembarked in fleets, and distributed in the ships. The officers were\r\ninterchangeable with those of the guards and line. John Churchill\r\n(afterwards duke of Marlborough) and George Rooke (afterwards Admiral\r\nSir George Rooke) were together at one time ensigns of marines. During\r\nthis period the marines were never regarded as a reserve for the fleet.\r\nThe navy in peace did without them. The necessities of maritime war\r\ndemanded a mobile military force adapted to naval conditions and at\r\nnaval disposal, and so in all naval operations during these eighty-four\r\nyears the marines played a conspicuous part. The navy had been slowly\r\ngroping towards a system. For example, sea officers had been granted a\r\nuniform, and a naval academy (1729) had been established for the\r\neducation of young gentlemen for the sea service. But in its main\r\nfeatures the navy remained in 1748 as it was in 1664. The sailor was\r\nkidnapped and forced into ships, to become an outcast when no longer\r\nwanted. The marine when not in a ship was comfortably housed and looked\r\nafter by his officers in barracks on shore.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 the marine force once more reappeared under the Admiralty, and\r\nfrom that date its history has been continuous. But the regimental\r\nsystem was abandoned, and an entirely new principle of organization was\r\napplied. Companies were raised, and these companies were grouped into\r\ngreat depots, called divisions, at Portsmouth, Plymouth and Chatham. At\r\nthese divisions this force could be increased and reduced at pleasure,\r\nwithout disturbing the basis of organization, and from them could be\r\nsupplied as many or as few sea-soldiers as fleets or ships needed, while\r\npreserving in the varying units so provided all the essentials of\r\nuniformity of system, drill, training, ties of comradeship and _esprit\r\nde corps_. This force then and for ninety-eight years afterwards was the\r\nonly continuously trained, disciplined and organized fighting force\r\nplaced by the country at the disposal of naval officers. On the\r\nestablishment of this new marine force the purchase of commissions was\r\nabolished, but interchange with the army was for a time permitted. When\r\nembarked, marines were under the naval code of discipline; when on\r\nshore, under the marine Mutiny Act, identical with that of the army.\r\nWhen the seamen of the fleet mutinied at the Nore, at the close of the\r\n18th century, and turned their officers out of the ships, the marines,\r\nundaunted, stood firm by theirs.\r\n\r\nMutiny lurked beneath the deck of many a ship before and long years\r\nafter that event. The control of admirals and captains over their own\r\nmen was precarious in the extreme. This was the natural result of the\r\ncountry's neglect of its seamen. The discipline of the fleet in those\r\ndays rested on the firm bayonets of the marines. What England owes to\r\nthem may be gathered from Lord St Vincent's recorded testimony: \"There\r\nnever was an appeal made to them for honour, courage or loyalty, that\r\nthey did not more than realize my highest expectation. If ever real\r\ndanger should come to England, the marines will be found the country's\r\nsheet-anchor.\" At his earnest solicitation the marines were made a royal\r\ncorps in 1802. It is worthy of note that in those days of masts, yards,\r\nsails and pure seamanship, this greatest of naval statesmen, this\r\nmatchless naval strategist, whose practical experience of maritime war\r\nwas unrivalled, strenuously advocated as the true policy for England\r\nwhat in these days of steam and mastless ships would be scouted and\r\nridiculed. It was to make service afloat as marines a part of the duty\r\nof every regiment of the line in rotation.\r\n\r\nDown to 1804 the marines were an infantry force; the improvement in\r\nartillery towards the close of the century had necessitated the\r\noccasional putting into the fleet of detachments of Royal Artillery.\r\nThis, as regards gunnery duties in the fleet, was repeating on a smaller\r\nscale the expedient adopted in the time of Charles II. So much friction\r\narose between the naval and the artillery officers that a special corps\r\nof Royal Marine Artillery was raised in 1804, on the recommendation of\r\nNelson. This special corps fulfilled the expectations of its founders.\r\nIt was charged with the care, equipment and working of the larger\r\nordnance afloat and field-guns ashore, and was employed also as a body\r\nof gunnery instructors to the fleet. In 1831, a certain number of naval\r\nofficers being thought to be sufficiently trained in gunnery, this\r\ncorps, of which Napier wrote, \"Never in my life have I seen soldiers\r\nlike the Royal Marine Artillery,\" was, without warning, abolished. Then\r\nthe marine force ceased to be composed of two corps, artillery and\r\ninfantry, and it reverted to a single one of infantry. Very soon\r\nafterwards, however, the Admiralty began to build up what they had so\r\nsuddenly and ruthlessly destroyed, by ordering the conversion of one\r\ncompany of each infantry marine division into artillery. The number of\r\nthese artillery companies gradually increased, and were grouped in a\r\nseparate depot. Just as the wars from Charles II. to George III. had\r\ndemanded marines, so the Crimean War led to their increase. Thus in 1859\r\nthe artillery companies of marines were formed into a separate division,\r\nand in 1862 the old name of Royal Marine Artillery was restored.\r\n\r\nThe marines thus became once more and still remain two corps, the\r\nofficial designation of the whole being Royal Marine Forces. In 1855 the\r\nmarine infantry corps became light infantry, and in 1869 the Woolwich\r\ndivision (added in 1805) was abolished; and more recently a marine\r\ndepot, as a feeder of the other divisions, was established at Walmer.\r\nThe headquarters of the R.M.A. are at Eastney, Southsea. The divisions\r\nR.M.L.I. are at Gosport, Chatham and Devonport. The uniform of the\r\nR.M.A. is blue with red facings, that of R.M.L.I. red with blue facings.\r\nThe badge of both corps is the globe surrounded with the laurel wreath,\r\nwith the motto \"Per mare per terram.\" The Royal Marine Forces share with\r\nthe 3rd Battalion Grenadier Guards, the East Kent Regiment (formerly the\r\nBuffs), and the Royal London Militia the privilege of marching through\r\nthe city of London with colours flying, bands playing and bayonets\r\nfixed. This is due to a common original association with the London\r\ntrain bands.\r\n\r\n  _War Services._--To describe these would be to review the wars waged\r\n  by England by sea and by land for over 200 years. In every sea fight,\r\n  great or small, marines have taken part, and on every continent they\r\n  have served in big and little wars, sometimes as part of the army,\r\n  sometimes with naval contingents, sometimes alone.\r\n\r\n  Throughout the Napoleonic war the marines took part in every sort of\r\n  operation afloat and ashore. During the Crimean War, mortar-boat\r\n  flotillas in the Baltic and Black Sea were commanded and manned by\r\n  R.M.A., while comrades in the same corps served with the Royal\r\n  Artillery in the trenches before Sebastopol--a marine infantry brigade\r\n  occupying the heights of Balaclava. During the Indian Mutiny, marines\r\n  (artillery and infantry) served with the Naval Brigade under Peel. In\r\n  the China wars batteries and brigades of the marine force played a\r\n  prominent part, and likewise were represented in all the Egyptian and\r\n  Sudan campaigns, 1881 to 1898. In one action the R.M.A. gunners came\r\n  to the relief of the Royal Horse Artillery when exhausted, and fought\r\n  their guns; in another the R.M.A., out of the débris of the enemy's\r\n  Krupp guns captured, built up one complete gun and fought it with\r\n  effect; in the final campaign gunboats were brought up in pieces, put\r\n  together and fought by a detachment of the R.M.A.\r\n\r\n  In 1899 in the Boer War the marine artillery and infantry took part\r\n  with the Naval Brigade, maintaining their historic reputation, and at\r\n  the battle of Enslin their losses were exceptionally severe.\r\n\r\n  _Characteristics of Marine System._--The recruit first goes to the\r\n  depot at Walmer, and is trained as a soldier before joining his\r\n  division to complete instruction as a marine. His division is his\r\n  permanent military home, from which he goes on service and to which he\r\n  returns at its conclusion. Restrictions on marriage, necessary under\r\n  the army system, are not necessary in the marine forces. The permanent\r\n  home of the wife and family is not broken up by the marine going\r\n  abroad; the wife thus can continue any local goodwill in any business\r\n  her industry may secure. This fixed home enables a marine to learn a\r\n  trade in the workshops of his division which supply the clothing, &c.,\r\n  to the corps. Marines are enlisted for 12 years, and if of good\r\n  character they can re-engage to complete 21 years, entitling to\r\n  pension. The periods of service abroad for marines are shorter\r\n  (generally 3 years), but more constantly recurrent than for the army.\r\n  The administrative, as distinct from the instructional, staff\r\n  necessary for a marine division is more simple and less expensive than\r\n  that of a numerical army equivalent expressed in regiments. The system\r\n  of pay and accounts is also less complex. The following table shows\r\n  the relative proportions of marine forces to the whole navy at\r\n  different periods up to the South African War of 1899:--\r\n\r\n    +------+----------+----------+---------+------------+----------+------------------------------+\r\n    |      |   Navy   | Marines. |         |  Maritime. | Percent. |                              |\r\n    | Year.|  proper. | Officers |  Grand  |  Peace or  | Marines  |       Nature of Ships.       |\r\n    |      | Officers | and Men. |  Total. |    War.    | to Total |                              |\r\n    |      | and Men. |          |         |            | Forces.  |                              |\r\n    +------+----------+----------+---------+------------+----------+------------------------------+\r\n    | 1805 | 90,000   |  30,000  | 120,000 |    War     |    25    | Sailing.                     |\r\n    |      |          |          |         |(Trafalgar) |          |                              |\r\n    | 1838 | 23,165   |   9,000  |  32,165 | \\          |    28    | Sailing.                     |\r\n    | 1858 | 40,219   |  14,919  |  55,138 |  > Peace   |    27    | Sailing with auxiliary steam.|\r\n    | 1878 | 42,046   |  13,727  |  55,773 | |          |    24    | Steam with auxiliary sail.   |\r\n    | 1898 | 78,441[1]|  17,099  |  95,540 | /          |    17    | Steam and mastless ships.    |\r\n    +------+----------+----------+---------+------------+----------+------------------------------+\r\n\r\n  The above table indicates a gradual change in naval policy and\r\n  practice as regards marines. It will be observed that, concurrently\r\n  with the gradual disappearance of masts, sails and yards, the\r\n  proportion of marines has steadily declined. Down to very recent times\r\n  the marine spent more time ashore than afloat. Now the reverse is the\r\n  case.\r\n\r\n  By the introduction of the Continuous Service Act 1853, the\r\n  blue-jacket was placed on exactly the same footing as the marine in\r\n  respect of conditions of service and pension, and now the blue-jacket\r\n  when not afloat is quartered in barracks. The main difference between\r\n  the blue-jacket and marine is the dress and the pay. The blue-jacket\r\n  is better paid than the marine. As regards opportunity of discipline,\r\n  there is now no difference; and in short, all the reasons for the\r\n  existence of a marine force have disappeared except as regards duties\r\n  on shore incidental to naval operations of war, e.g. the holding of\r\n  ports and the seizing of minor positions necessary to prosecution of\r\n  maritime war. The facts that modern ships cannot now as formerly carry\r\n  a supernumerary force sufficient for such purposes, and are more\r\n  dependent on fixed bases of supply and repair than in old days, point\r\n  to a different method of using and applying the marine force to the\r\n  sole purpose for which they are now necessary as a distinct branch of\r\n  the naval service. If employed at the headquarters of a naval station,\r\n  their efficiency as marines could be preserved by occasional\r\n  embarcation of the officers and men in rotation. The substitution of\r\n  marine for army garrisons at coaling stations would also relieve the\r\n  army of a class of duties incidental to naval warfare which the marine\r\n  force formerly performed, and which prejudicially affects the\r\n  organization and arrangement of the army as a mobile field force.\r\n\r\n_Marine Corps, United States._--This dates from the establishment of the\r\nAmerican navy. It is a wholly separate military body, though under the\r\ncontrol of the Navy Department. It was formed in 1775, and it has a\r\nhistory of brilliant services rendered by land and sea in all the wars\r\nof America since that date. The headquarters of the corps are at\r\nWashington, and the strength of the corps was fixed by Act of Congress\r\n(March 3, 1899) at 211 officers and 5920 non-commissioned officers and\r\nmen. Its organization and system are based on the British model, and the\r\ndress corresponds to that of the United States army. The corps is\r\ncommanded by a brigadier-general who bears to the secretary a relation\r\nsimilar to that of a chief of bureau. Although the organization closely\r\nfollows the army system, regimental or even permanent battalion\r\norganizations are impracticable, owing to their numerous and\r\nwidely-separated stations. Practically all shore stations have barracks\r\nwhere marines are enlisted and drilled. At these places they also do\r\nsentry, police and orderly duties. From such stations they are sent to\r\nships for sea duty. Nearly all ships carry a body of marines known as\r\nthe guard, varying in size from a few men commanded by a sergeant, on\r\nsmall ships, to eighty or more, with one or more commissioned officers,\r\non large vessels. It is customary to cause all marines to serve at sea\r\nthree of the four years of each enlistment. On board ship they perform\r\nsentry and orderly duty, and assist in police duties. They are also\r\ninstructed in many exercises pertaining to the navy, as rowing, naval\r\nsignalling, gun drill, &c. In action they act as riflemen, and on many\r\nships serve a portion of the guns. When circumstances require a force to\r\nbe landed from ships present to guard American interests in foreign\r\ncountries, legations, &c., the marine guard is usually sent, though, if\r\nnumerically insufficient, sailors are landed also. Marines also garrison\r\nplaces beyond the territorial limits of the United States which are\r\nunder navy control. Candidates for first enlistment must be between the\r\nages of 21 and 35 and unmarried, must be citizens of the United States,\r\nbe able to read, write and speak English, and pass a physical\r\nexamination. Second lieutenants are appointed from civil life after\r\nexamination or from the graduates of the Naval Academy. Promotion is by\r\nseniority as in the navy.\r\n\r\n  Admiral Farragut's opinion that \"the marine guard is one of the great\r\n  essentials of a man-of-war\" is corroborated by that of Admiral Wilkes,\r\n  who considered that \"marines constituted the great difference between\r\n  a man-of-war and a privateer.\" In the famous battles between the\r\n  \"Bonhomme Richard\" and \"Serapis\" in 1777, and in that between the\r\n  \"Chesapeake\" and \"Shannon,\" the American marines displayed brilliant\r\n  gallantry; and while on the one hand they at Derne in 1803 first\r\n  planted the American flag on a fortress of the Old World, for which\r\n  exploit \"Tripoli\" is inscribed on their colours, they on the other\r\n  shared in the hard fighting of the Mexican War as well as all the\r\n  important coast actions of the Civil War of 1861-65. A proposal to\r\n  incorporate them with the army after the struggle met with universal\r\n  condemnation from the authorities best qualified to judge of their\r\n  value. A brigade of three battalions served in the Philippines in\r\n  1899. Their device is a globe resting on an anchor and surmounted by\r\n  an eagle. \"Ever faithful\" is the title which Captain Luce, the\r\n  historian of the force, appropriately applies to them.\r\n       (J. C. R.

N. of Milwaukee, on the W. shore of Green Bay, at the\r\nmouth of the Menominee River. Pop. (1890), 11,523; (1900), 16,195, of\r\nwhom 5542 were foreign-born; (1905), 15,354; (1910), 14,610. It is\r\nserved directly by the Wisconsin & Michigan, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St\r\nPaul, and the Chicago & North-Western railways, and by several steamboat\r\nlines connecting with lake ports; and is connected by ferry with\r\nFrankfort, Michigan (served by the Ann Arbor railroad). The city has a\r\nfine harbour and a considerable commerce in iron and lumber products.\r\nFive bridges connect Marinette with Menominee, Michigan, on the other\r\nside of the river. Marinette has a Federal building; the Stephenson\r\npublic library, founded by Senator Isaac Stephenson (b. 1829), a local\r\n\"lumber king\"; a county agricultural school and training school for\r\nrural teachers, and three public parks. The Northern Chautauqua Assembly\r\nholds its annual summer session in Chautauqua Park, on the shore of\r\nGreen Bay. The growth of Marinette began with the development of the\r\nneighbouring pine forests; and the manufacture of lumber and lumber\r\nproducts has always been its principal industry. The water-power of the\r\nMenominee River is largely utilized for the manufacture of paper and\r\nflour. Other manufactures are boxes, furniture and woodware, boats,\r\nboilers and agricultural machinery. In 1905 the factory products were\r\nvalued at $3,633,399. The first white settlement was made here on the\r\nsite of a Menominee Indian village in 1830, and the city was named in\r\nhonour of the daughter of an Indian chief, Marinette (Jacobs), whose\r\nname was a composite of Marie and Antoinette. A city charter was granted\r\nin 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINI (or MARINO), GIAMBATTISTA (1560-1625), Italian poet, was born at\r\nNaples on the 18th of October 1569. After a somewhat disreputable youth,\r\nduring which he became known for his _Canzone de' baci_, he secured the\r\npowerful patronage of Cardinal Aldobrandini, whom he accompanied from\r\nRome to Ravenna and Turin. An edition of his poems, _La Lira_, was\r\npublished at Venice in 1602-1614. His ungoverned pen and disordered life\r\ncompelled him to leave Turin and take refuge from 1615 to 1622 in Paris,\r\nwhere he was favourably recognized by Marie de' Medici. There his long\r\npoem _Adone_ was published in 1623. He died at Naples on the 25th of\r\nMarch 1625. The licence, extravagance and conceits of Marini, the chief\r\nof the school of \"Secentisti\" (see ITALY: _Literature_), were\r\ncharacteristic of a period of literary decadence.\r\n\r\n  See M. Menghini, _G. B. Marini_ (Rome, 1888).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINO, a town of Italy, in the province of Rome, 15 m. S.E. of it by\r\nrail, and also accessible by electric tramway. Pop. (1901), 7307. It is\r\npicturesquely situated on a spur of the Alban Hills, 1165 ft. above sea\r\nlevel, and occupies the site of the ancient Castrimoenium, a\r\n_municipium_ of no great importance, though the surrounding district,\r\nwhich now produces much wine, is full of remains of ancient villas. The\r\norigin of the name is uncertain; perhaps it is derived from the medieval\r\n_Morena_ (itself derived from the Latin _Murena_, from one of the Roman\r\nowners of the district), a name originally given to the lower ground\r\nbetween the 9th and 11th mile of the Via Latina. In the early 13th\r\ncentury it belonged to the Frangipani family, but passed into the hands\r\nof the Orsini in 1266. In 1378 a battle took place here between the\r\npartisans of Urban VI. and those of the anti-pope Clement VII. of Geneva\r\n(the Orsini having taken the side of the latter), who were, however,\r\ndefeated; and in 1399 Marino was apparently under the Papacy. In 1408 it\r\npassed to the Colonna family, to whom it still belongs. There are some\r\nremains of the medieval fortifications.\r\n\r\n  See G. Tomassetti, _La Via latina nel medio evo_ (Rome, 1886), p. 96\r\n  seq.; T. Ashby, in _Papers of the British School at Rome_, vol. iv.\r\n  (1907).     (T. As.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINUS, the name of two popes. MARINUS I., sometimes called Martin II.,\r\npope from 882 to 884, was the son of a Tuscan priest, and entered the\r\nchurch at an early age, becoming a deacon about 862. Three successive\r\npopes sent him as legate to Constantinople, his mission in each case\r\nhaving reference to the controversy excited by Photius (q.v.); and\r\nhaving become an archdeacon and a bishop, he also negotiated on behalf\r\nof pope John VIII. with the emperor Charles the Fat. About the end of\r\nDecember 882 he succeeded John VIII. as pope, but his election did not\r\npass unchallenged either in eastern or in western Europe. However,\r\nhaving secured his position, Marinus restored Formosus, cardinal-bishop\r\nof Porto, and anathematized Photius. This pope was on friendly terms\r\nwith the English king, Alfred the Great. He died in May 884, and was\r\nsucceeded by Adrian III.\r\n\r\nMARINUS II., sometimes called Martin III., pope from 942 to 946, was\r\nmerely the puppet of Alberic (d. 954), prince and senator of the Romans.\r\nHe died in May 946, and was succeeded by Agapetus II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINUS, neo-Platonist philosopher, was born in Palestine and was early\r\nconverted to the old Greek religion. He came to Athens at a time when,\r\nwith the exception of Proclus, there was a great dearth of eminent men\r\nin the neo-Platonic school. It was for this reason rather than for any\r\nstriking ability of his own that he succeeded to the headship of the\r\nschool on the death of Proclus. During this period the professors of the\r\nold Greek religion suffered severe persecution at the hands of the\r\nChristians and Marinus was compelled to seek refuge at Epidaurus. His\r\nchief work was a biography of Proclus, which is extant. It was first\r\npublished with the works of Marcus Antoninus in 1559; it was republished\r\nseparately by Fabricius at Hamburg in 1700, and re-edited in 1814 by\r\nBoissonade with emendations and notes. Other philosophical works are\r\nattributed to him, including commentaries on Aristotle and on the\r\n_Philebus_. It is said that he destroyed the latter because Isidore, his\r\nsuccessor, expressed disapproval of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARINUS OF TYRE, geographer and mathematician, the founder of\r\nmathematical geography, flourished in the 2nd century A.D. He lived\r\nbefore Ptolemy, who acknowledges his great obligations to him. His chief\r\nmerits were that he assigned to each place its proper latitude and\r\nlongitude, and introduced improvements in the construction of his maps.\r\nHe also carefully studied the works of his predecessors and the diaries\r\nof travellers. His geographical treatise is lost.\r\n\r\n  See A. Forbiger, _Handbuch der alten Geographie_, vol. i. (1842); E.\r\n  H. Bunbury, _Hist. of Ancient Geography_ (1879), ii. p. 519; and\r\n  especially E. H. Berger, _Geschichte der wissenschaftlichen Erdkunde\r\n  der Griechen_ (1903).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIO, GIUSEPPE, COUNT OF CANDIA (1810-1883), Italian singer, the most\r\nfamous tenor of the 19th century, son of General di Candia, was born at\r\nCagliari in 1810. His career as a singer was the result of accidental\r\ncircumstances. While serving as an officer in the Sardinian army he was\r\nimprisoned at Cagliari for some trifling offence. When his period of\r\nconfinement was over, he resigned his commission. His resignation was\r\nrefused, and he fled to Paris. There his success as an amateur vocalist\r\nproduced an offer of an engagement at the Opera. He studied singing for\r\ntwo years under M. Ponchard and Signor Bordogni, and made his début in\r\n1838 as the hero of Meyerheer's _Robert le Diable_. His success was\r\nimmediate and complete, but he did not stay long at the Opera. In 1839\r\nhe joined the company of the Théâtre Italien, which then included\r\nMalibran, Sontag, Persiani and Grisi, Rubini, Tamburini and Lablache.\r\nHis first appearance here was made in the character of Nemorino in\r\nDonizetti's _Elisir d'Amore_. He sang in London for the first time in\r\nthe same year. His success in Italian opera far surpassed that which he\r\nhad won in French, and in a short time he acquired a European\r\nreputation. He had a handsome face and a graceful figure, and his voice,\r\nthough less powerful than that of Rubini or that of Tamberlik, had a\r\nvelvety softness and richness which have never been equalled. Experience\r\ngave him ease as an actor, but he never excelled in tragic parts. He was\r\nan ideal stage lover, and he retained the grace and charm of youth long\r\nafter his voice had begun to show signs of decay. He created very few\r\nnew parts, that of Ernesto in _Don Pasquale_ (1843) being perhaps the\r\nonly one deserving of mention. Among the most successful of his other\r\nparts were Otello in Rossini's opera of that name, Gennaro in _Lucrezia\r\nBorgia_, Alamviva in _Il Barbiere di Siviglia_, Fernando in _La\r\nFavorita_, and Manrico in _Il Trovatore_. Mario made occasional\r\nappearances in oratorio singing at the Birmingham Festival of 1849 and\r\nat the Hereford Festival of 1855, and undertook various concert tours in\r\nthe United Kingdom, but his name is principally associated with triumphs\r\nin the theatre. In 1856 he married Giulia Grisi, the famous soprano, by\r\nwhom he had five daughters. Mario bade farewell to the stage in 1871. He\r\ndied at Rome in reduced circumstances on the 11th of December 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION, FRANCIS (1732-1795), American soldier, was born in 1732,\r\nprobably at Winyah, near Georgetown, South Carolina, of Huguenot\r\nancestry. In 1759 he settled on Pond Bluff plantation near Eutaw\r\nSprings, in St John's parish, Berkeley county. In 1761 he served as a\r\nlieutenant under William Moultrie in a campaign against the Cherokees.\r\nIn 1775 he was a member of the South Carolina Provincial Congress; and\r\non the 21st of June was commissioned captain in the 2nd South Carolina\r\nregiment under W. Moultrie, with whom he served in June 1776 in the\r\ndefence of Fort Sullivan (Fort Moultrie), in Charleston Harbor. In\r\nSeptember 1776 the Continental Congress commissioned him a\r\nlieutenant-colonel. In the autumn of 1779 he took part in the siege of\r\nSavannah, and early in 1780, under General Benjamin Lincoln, was engaged\r\nin drilling militia. After the capture of Charleston (May 12,1780) and\r\nthe defeats of General Isaac Huger at Monk's Corner (Berkeley county,\r\nSouth Carolina) and Lieut.-Colonel Abraham Buford at the Waxhaws (near\r\nthe North Carolina line, in what is now Lancaster county), Marion\r\norganized a small troop--which usually consisted of between 20 and 70\r\nmen--the only force then opposing the British in the state. Governor\r\nJohn Rutledge made him a brigadier-general of state troops, and in\r\nAugust 1780 Marion took command of the scanty militia, ill equipped and\r\nill fed. With this force he was identified for almost all the remainder\r\nof the war in a partisan warfare in which he showed himself a singularly\r\nable leader of irregular troops. On the 20th of August he captured 150\r\nMaryland prisoners, and about a score of their British guard; and in\r\nSeptember and October repeatedly surprised larger bodies of Loyalists or\r\nBritish regulars. Colonel Banastre Tarleton, sent out to capture him,\r\ndespaired of finding the \"old swamp fox,\" who eluded him by following\r\nswamp paths. When General Nathanael Greene took command in the south,\r\nMarion and Colonel Henry Lee were ordered in January 1781 to attack\r\nGeorgetown, but they were unsuccessful. In April, however, they took\r\nFort Watson and in May Fort Motte, and they succeeded in breaking\r\ncommunications between the British posts in the Carolinas. On the 31st\r\nof August Marion rescued a small American force hemmed in by Major C.\r\nFraser with 500 British; and for this he received the thanks of\r\nCongress. He commanded the right wing under General Greene at Eutaw\r\nSprings. In 1782, during his absence as state senator at Jacksonborough,\r\nhis brigade deteriorated and there was a conspiracy to turn him over to\r\nthe British. In June of the same year he put down a Loyalist uprising on\r\nthe banks of the Pedee river; and in August he left his brigade and\r\nreturned to his plantation. He served several terms in the state Senate,\r\nand in 1784, in recognition of his services, was made commander of Fort\r\nJohnson, practically a courtesy title with a salary of £500 per annum.\r\nHe died on his estate on the 27th of February 1795. Marion was small,\r\nslight and sickly-looking. As a soldier he was quick, watchful,\r\nresourceful and calm, the greatest of partisan leaders in the bitter\r\nstruggle in the Carolinas.\r\n\r\n  See the _Life_ (New York, 1844) by W. G. Simms; Edward McCrady, _South\r\n  Carolina in the Revolution_ (New York, 1901-1902); and a careful study\r\n  of Marion's ancestry and early life by \"R. Y.\" in vols. i. and ii. of\r\n  the _Southern and Western Monthly Magazine and Review_ (Charleston,\r\n  1845).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION, HENRI FRANÇOIS (1846-1896), French philosopher and\r\neducationalist, was born at Saint-Parize-en-Viry (Nièvre) on the 9th of\r\nSeptember 1846. He studied at Nevers, and at the École Normale, where he\r\ngraduated in 1868. After occupying several minor positions, he returned\r\nto Paris in 1875 as professor of the Lycée Henri IV., and in 1880 he\r\nbecame _docteur-ès-lettres_. In the same year he was elected a member of\r\nthe Council of Public Instruction, and devoted himself to improving the\r\nscheme of French education, especially in girls' schools. He was largely\r\ninstrumental in the foundation of _écoles normales_ in provincial towns,\r\nand himself gave courses of lectures on psychology and practical ethics\r\nin their early days. He died in Paris on the 5th of April 1896.\r\n\r\n  His chief philosophical works were an edition of the _Théodicée_ of\r\n  Leibnitz (1874), a monograph on Locke (1878), _Devoirs et droits de\r\n  l'homme_ (1880), _Glissonius utrum Leibnitio de natura substantiae\r\n  cogitanti quidquam tribuerit_ (1880); _De La solidarité morale_ (4th\r\n  ed., 1893). His lectures at Fontenoy have been published in two\r\n  volumes entitled _Leçons de psychologie appliquée à l'éducation_, and\r\n  _Leçons de morale_; those delivered at the Sorbonne are collected in\r\n  _L'Éducation dans l'université_ (1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION, a city and the county-seat of Grant county, Indiana, U.S.A.,\r\nabout 60 m. N.E. of Indianapolis, on the Mississinewa River. Pop.\r\n(1910), 19,359. It is served by the Chicago, Cincinnati & Louisville,\r\nthe Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis, the Pittsburgh,\r\nCincinnati, Chicago & St Louis, and the Toledo, St Louis & Western\r\nrailways, and by interurban electric lines connecting with Indianapolis,\r\nMuncie, Fort Wayne, Kokomo and many other towns and cities. The city is\r\nthe seat of the Marion Normal College and Business University, and has a\r\nCarnegie library. Marion lies in a good farming country and in the\r\ncentre of the state's natural gas region. Among the manufactures are\r\nglass, stoves, iron bedsteads, foundry and machine-shop products, steel,\r\nplaning-mill products, paper and pulp, and leather. The total value of\r\nthe factory products in 1905 was $4,290,166, the value of the glass\r\nproduct alone being $1,042,057, or 24.3% of the total. Marion was\r\nsettled in 1832, and was named in honour of General Francis Marion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION, a city and the county-seat of Marion county, Ohio, U.S.A., 44 m.\r\nN. by W. of Columbus. Pop. (1900), 11,862, including 782 foreign-born\r\nand 112 negroes; (1900), 18,232. Marion is served by the Pennsylvania,\r\nthe Erie, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & St. Louis, and the\r\nHocking Valley railways, and by interurban electric railway to Columbus.\r\nIt is the trade centre of a rich farming district. Limestone is\r\nabundant, and the city has various manufactures, including lime, foundry\r\nand machine-shop products, agricultural implements, planing-mill\r\nproducts, engines, steam shovels, dredges, pianos and silks. In 1905 the\r\nvalue of factory products was $3,227,712, being 33.1% greater than in\r\n1900. Marion was laid out in 1821, and was chartered as a city in 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIONETTES (probably from Ital. _morio_, a fool or buffoon, but also\r\nsaid to be derived from the _mariolettes_, or little figures of the\r\nVirgin Mary), FANTOCCINI (from _fantino_, a child) or PUPPETS (Fr.\r\n_poupée_ Lat. _pupa_, a baby or doll), the names given to figures,\r\ngenerally below life-size, suspended by threads or wires and imitating\r\nwith their limbs and heads the movements of living persons.\r\n\r\nThe high antiquity of puppets appears from the fact that figures with\r\nmovable limbs have been discovered in the tombs of Egypt and among the\r\nremains of Etruria; they were also common among the Greeks, from whom\r\nthey were imported to Rome. Plays in which the characters are\r\nrepresented by puppets or by the shadows of moving figures, worked by\r\nconcealed performers who deliver the dialogue, are not only popular in\r\nIndia and China, but during several centuries past maintained an\r\nimportant position among the amusements of the people in most European\r\ncountries. Goethe and Lessing deemed them worthy of attention; and in\r\n1721 Le Sage wrote plays for puppets to perform.\r\n\r\nThe earliest performances in English were drawn or founded upon Bible\r\nnarratives and the lives of the saints, in the same vein as the\r\n\"morality\" plays which they succeeded. Popular subjects in the 16th\r\ncentury were _The Prodigal Son_ and _Nineveh, with Jonah and the Whale_.\r\nAnd in a pamphlet of 1641, describing Bartholomew Fair, we read, \"Here a\r\nknave in a fool's coat, with a trumpet sounding or a drum beating,\r\ninvites you to see his puppets. Here a rogue like a wild woodman, or in\r\nan antic shape like an incubus, desires your company to view his\r\nmotion.\" In 1667 Pepys recorded how at Bartholomew Fair he found \"my\r\nLady Castlemaine at a puppet play, Patient Grizill.\" Besides _The\r\nSorrows of Griselda_, other puppet plays of the period were _Dick\r\nWhittington_, _The Vagaries of Merry Andrew_, and _The Humours of\r\nBartholomew Fair_. Powell's noted marionette show was the subject of an\r\narticle in _The Tatler_, 1709, and again in _The Spectator_, 1711. The\r\nlatter refers also to Pinkethman, a \"motion-maker,\" in whose scenes the\r\ndivinities of Olympus ascended and descended to the strains of music. An\r\nidea of the class of representation may be gathered from an\r\nadvertisement of Crawley, a rival of Pinkethman, which sets forth--\"The\r\nOld Creation of the World, with the addition of Noah's Flood,\" also\r\nseveral fountains playing water during the time of the play. The best\r\nscene represented \"Noah and his family coming out of the ark, with all\r\nthe animals two by two, and all the fowls of the air seen in a prospect\r\nsitting upon trees; likewise over the ark is the sun rising in a\r\ngorgeous manner; moreover a multitude of angels in a double rank,\" the\r\nangels ringing bells. \"Likewise machines descending from above, double,\r\nwith Dives rising out of hell and Lazarus seen in Abraham's bosom;\r\nbesides several figures dancing jiggs, sarabands, and country dances,\r\nwith the merry conceits of Squire Punch and Sir John Spendall.\" Yates\r\nshowed a moving picture of a city, with an artificial cascade, and a\r\ntemple--with mechanical birds in which attention was called to the exact\r\nimitation of living birds, the quick motion of the bills, just swelling\r\nof the throat, and fluttering of the wings. The puppets were wax figures\r\n5 ft. in stature. Toward the end of the 18th century, Flockton's show\r\npresented five hundred figures at work at various trades. Brown's\r\nTheatre of Arts showed at country fairs, from 1830 to 1840, the battle\r\nof Trafalgar, Napoleon's army crossing the Alps, and the marble palace\r\nof St Petersburg; and at a still later date Clapton's similar exhibition\r\npresented Grace Darling rescuing the crew of the \"Forfarshire\" steamer\r\nwrecked on the Fern Islands, with many ingenious moving figures of\r\nquadrupeds, and, in particular, a swan which dipped its head into\r\nimitation water, opened its wings, and with flexible neck preened and\r\ntrimmed its plumage. In these mechanical scenes the figures, painted\r\nupon a flat surface and cut out, commonly of pasteboard, are slid along\r\ngrooves arranged transversely in front of the set scenery, the actions\r\nof legs and arms being worked by wires from the hands of persons below\r\nthe stage, though sometimes use is made of clockwork. In recent days the\r\nliterature for the marionette stage has had an important literary\r\nrecruit in the person of the Belgian author Maurice Maeterlinck.\r\n\r\n  Marionettes proper, and the dolls exhibited in puppet shows (not\r\n  including Punch and his companion actors), are constructed of wood or\r\n  of pasteboard, with faces of composition, sometimes of wax; and each\r\n  figure is suspended by a number of threads to a short bar of wood\r\n  which is commonly held in one hand of the hidden performer while the\r\n  finger of his other hand poses the figure or gives action to it by\r\n  means of the threads. In the mode of constructing the joints, and the\r\n  greater elaboration with which the several parts of the limbs are\r\n  supported and moved, and especially in the fine degrees of movement\r\n  given to the heads, marionettes have been so improved as to present\r\n  very exact imitations of the gestures of actors and actresses, and the\r\n  postures and evolutions of acrobats; and, in addition, ingenious\r\n  exhibitors such as Theodon, who introduced many novelties in the\r\n  'sixties of the 19th century, have employed mechanical arrangements\r\n  for accomplishing the tricks of pantomime harlequinade. Among the\r\n  puppet personages presented in the small street shows are generally\r\n  included a sailor who dances a hornpipe, a hoop-dancer, a dancer of\r\n  the Highland fling, a wooden-legged pensioner, a vaulter on a pole\r\n  also balancing two chairs, a clown playing with a butterfly, a dancing\r\n  figure without head until the head rises out of the body, gradually\r\n  displaying an enormously long neck, and a skeleton, seen at first in\r\n  scattered parts lying about the stage, but piece successively flying\r\n  to piece, the body first sitting up, then standing, and finally capped\r\n  by the skull, when the completed figure begins to dance.\r\n\r\n  _Ombres Chinoises_ are performances by means of the shadows of figures\r\n  projected upon a stretched sheet of thin calico or a gauze scene\r\n  painted as a transparency. The cardboard flat figures are held behind\r\n  this screen, illuminated from behind--the performer supporting each\r\n  figure by a long wire held in one hand while wires from all the\r\n  movable parts terminate in rings in which are inserted the fingers of\r\n  his other hand.\r\n\r\n  See also C. Magnin, _Histoire des marionettes_ (1852; 2nd ed., 1862);\r\n  L. de Neuville, _Histoire des marionettes_ (1892).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIOTTE, EDME (c. 1620-1684), French physicist, spent most of his life\r\nat Dijon, where he was prior of St Martin sous Beaune. He was one of the\r\nfirst members of the Academy of Sciences founded at Paris in 1666. He\r\ndied at Paris on the 12th of May 1684. The first volume of the _Histoire\r\net mémoires de l'Académie_ (1733) contains many original papers by him\r\nupon a great variety of physical subjects, such as the motion of fluids,\r\nthe nature of colour, the notes of the trumpet, the barometer, the fall\r\nof bodies, the recoil of guns, the freezing of water, &c.\r\n\r\n  His _Essais de physique_, four in number, of which the first three\r\n  were published at Paris between 1676 and 1679, are his most important\r\n  works, and form, together with a _Traité de la percussion des corps_,\r\n  the first volume of the _Oeuvres de Mariotte_ (2 vols., Leiden, 1717).\r\n  The second of these essays (_De La nature de l'air_) contains the\r\n  statement of the law that the volume of a gas varies inversely as the\r\n  pressure, which, though very generally called by the name of Mariotte,\r\n  had been discovered in 1660 by Robert Boyle. The fourth essay is a\r\n  systematic treatment of the nature of colour, with a description of\r\n  many curious experiments and a discussion of the rainbow, halos,\r\n  parhelia, diffraction, and the more purely physiological phenomena of\r\n  colour. The discovery of the blind spot is noted in a short paper in\r\n  the second volume of his collected works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIPOSAN, or YOKUTS, a linguistic stock of North American Indians,\r\nincluding some 40 small tribes. Its former territory was in southern\r\nCalifornia, around Tulare lake. The Mariposans were fishers and hunters.\r\nTheir villages consisted of a single row of wedge-shaped huts, with an\r\nawning of brush along the front. In 1850 they numbered some 3000; in\r\n1905 there were 154 on the Tule river reservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIS, JACOB (1837-1899), Dutch painter, first studied at the Antwerp\r\nAcademy, and subsequently in Hébert's studio during a stay in Paris from\r\n1865 till 1871. He returned to Holland when the Franco-Prussian War\r\nbroke out, and died there in August 1899. Though he painted, especially\r\nin early life, domestic scenes and interiors invested with deeply\r\nsympathetic feeling, it is as a landscape painter that Maris will be\r\nfamous. He was the painter of bridges and windmills, of old quays,\r\nmassive towers, and level banks; even more was he the painter of water,\r\nand misty skies, and chasing clouds. In all his works, whether in water\r\nor oil colour, and in his etchings, the subject is always subordinate to\r\nthe effect. His art is suggestive rather than decorative, and his force\r\ndoes not seem to depend on any preconceived method, such as a\r\nsynthetical treatment of form or gradations of tone. And yet, though his\r\nmeans appear so simple, the artist's mind seems to communicate with the\r\nspectator's by directness of pictorial instinct, and we have only to\r\nobserve the admirable balance of composition and truthful perspective to\r\nunderstand the sure knowledge of his business that underlies such purely\r\nimpressionist handling. Maris has shown all that is gravest or brightest\r\nin the landscape of Holland, all that is heaviest or clearest in its\r\natmosphere--for instance, in the \"Grey Tower, Old Amsterdam,\" in the\r\n\"Landscape near Dordrecht,\" in the \"Sea-weed Carts, Scheveningen,\" in \"A\r\nVillage Scene,\" and in the numerous other pictures which have been\r\nexhibited in the Royal Academy, London, in Edinburgh (1885), Paris,\r\nBrussels and Holland, and in various private collections. \"No painter,\"\r\nsays M. Philippe Zilcken, \"has so well expressed the ethereal effects,\r\nbathed in air and light through floating silvery mist, in which painters\r\ndelight, and the characteristic remote horizons blurred by haze; or\r\nagain, the grey yet luminous weather of Holland, unlike the dead grey\r\nrain of England or the heavy sky of Paris.\"\r\n\r\n  See Max Rooses, _Dutch Painters of the Nineteenth Century_ (London,\r\n  1899); R. A. M. Stevenson, \"Jacob Maris,\" _Magazine of Art_ (1900);\r\n  Ph.

It consists of a strip of territory along the coast of\r\nthe Pacific from Korea to the Arctic Ocean, including also the peninsula\r\nof Kamchatka, part of the island of Sakhalin, and several small islands\r\nalong the coast. Its western boundary stretches northwards from a point\r\nS.W. of Peter the Great Bay (42° 40´ N.) by Lake Hanka or Khanka and\r\nalong the Usuri, then goes due north from the mouth of the Usuri as far\r\nas 52° N., runs along the Stanovoi watershed, crosses the spurs of this\r\nplateau through barren _tundras_, and finally reaches the Arctic Ocean\r\nat Chaun Bay (70° N.). Area, 715,735 sq. m.\r\n\r\n  The northern part lies between the Arctic Ocean and the Seas of Bering\r\n  and Okhotsk, and has the character of a barren plateau 1000 to 2000\r\n  ft. high, deeply indented by the rivers of the Anadyr basin and by\r\n  long fiords, such as Kolyuchin Bay (the wintering-place of\r\n  Nordenskjöld s \"Vega\"), the Gulf of Anadyr, and the Bays of Penzhina\r\n  and Ghizhiga. To the north this plateau is bordered by a chain of\r\n  mountains, several summits of which reach 8000 ft. (Makachinga peak),\r\n  while the promontories by which the Asiatic continent terminates\r\n  towards Bering Strait run up to 1000 to 2000 ft. Only lichens and\r\n  mosses, with a few dwarf species of Siberian trees, grow in this\r\n  district. The fauna, however, is far richer than might be expected. A\r\n  few American birds and mammals cross the strait when it is frozen.\r\n  This country, and the seas which surround it, have for the last two\r\n  centuries supplied Siberian trade with its best furs. The blue fox and\r\n  black sable have been nearly exterminated, and the whale has become\r\n  very rare. The sea-otter is rapidly becoming extinct, as well as the\r\n  sea-lion (_Otaria stelleri_); while the sea-cow (_Rhytina stelleri_)\r\n  was completely extirpated in the course of forty years. The sea-bear\r\n  (_Otaria ursina_), which at one time seemed likely to meet with the\r\n  same fate, is now nearly domesticated, and multiplies rapidly. The\r\n  middle part of the province is a narrow strip (40 to 60 m. wide) along\r\n  the Sea of Okhotsk, including the basin of the Uda in the south. This\r\n  area is occupied by rugged mountains, 4000 to 7000 ft. high, forming\r\n  the eastern border of the high plateau of East Siberia. Thick forests\r\n  of larch clothe the mountains half way up, as well as the deep\r\n  valleys. The undulating hills of the basin of the Uda, which is a\r\n  continuation to the south-west, between the Stanovoi and Bureya\r\n  mountains, of the deep indentation of the Sea of Okhotsk, are covered\r\n  with forests and marshes.\r\n\r\n  The southern part of the province includes two distinct regions. From\r\n  the north-eastern extremity of the Bureya, or Little Khingan range, of\r\n  which the group of the Shantar Islands is a continuation, a wide, deep\r\n  depression runs south-west to the confluence of the Amur and the\r\n  Usuri, and thence to the lowlands of the lower Sungari. This is for\r\n  the most part less than 500 ft. above sea-level. The region on the\r\n  right banks of the Amur and the Usuri, between these rivers and the\r\n  coast, is occupied by several systems of mountains, usually\r\n  represented as a single range, the Sikhota-alin. The summits reach\r\n  5150 ft. (Golaya Gora), and the average elevation of the few passes is\r\n  about 2500 ft. There is, however, one depression occupied by Lake\r\n  Kidzi, which may have been at one time an outflow of the Amur to the\r\n  sea. The Sikhota-alin mountains are covered with impenetrable forests.\r\n  The flora and fauna of this region (especially in the Usuri district)\r\n  exhibit a striking combination of species of warm climates with those\r\n  of subarctic regions; the wild vine clings to the larch and the\r\n  cedar-pine, and the tiger meets the bear and the sable. The quantity\r\n  of fish in the rivers is immense, and in August the Amur and the Usuri\r\n  swarm with salmon.\r\n\r\n  The best part of the Maritime Province is at its southern extremity in\r\n  the valley of the Suifeng river, which enters the Pacific in the Gulf\r\n  of Peter the Great, and on the shores of the bays of the southern\r\n  coast. But even there the climate is very harsh. The warm sea-current\r\n  of the Kuro-Siwo does not reach the coasts of Siberia, while a cold\r\n  current originating in the Sea of Okhotsk brings its icy water and\r\n  chilling fogs to the coasts of Sakhalin, and flows along the Pacific\r\n  shore to the eastern coast of Korea. The high mountains of the\r\n  sea-coast and the monsoons of the Chinese Sea produce in the southern\r\n  parts of the Maritime Province cold winters and wet summers.\r\n  Accordingly, at Vladivostok (on the Gulf of Peter the Great), although\r\n  it has the same latitude as Marseilles, the average yearly temperature\r\n  is only 39.5° F., and the harbour is frozen for nearly three months in\r\n  the year; the Amur and the Usuri are frozen in November. Towards the\r\n  end of summer the moist monsoons bring heavy rains, which destroy the\r\n  harvests and give rise to serious inundations of the Amur. The\r\n  sea-coast farther north has a continental and arctic climate. At\r\n  Nikolayevsk, temperatures as low as -41.5° F. are observed in winter,\r\n  and as high as 94.6° in summer, the average yearly temperature being\r\n  below zero (-0.9°). At Ayan (56° 27´ N.) the average temperature of\r\n  the year is 25.5° (-0.4° in winter and 50.5° in summer), and at\r\n  Okhotsk (59° 21´ N.) it is 23° (-6° in winter and 52.5° in summer).\r\n\r\n  Russian settlements occur throughout the whole of the province, but,\r\n  with the exception of those on the banks of the Amur and the Usuri,\r\n  and the southern ports of the sea-coast, they are mere centres of\r\n  administration.\r\n\r\n  Okhotsk is one of the oldest towns of East Siberia, having been\r\n  founded in 1649. Nikolayevsk, on the left bank of the Amur, was\r\n  formerly the capital of the Maritime Province; but the difficulties of\r\n  navigation and of communication with the interior, and the complete\r\n  failure of the governmental colonization of the Amur, caused the seat\r\n  of government to be transferred to Khabarovsk. Since the loss (1905)\r\n  of Port Arthur to the Japanese, Vladivostok on Peter the Great Bay has\r\n  again become the chief naval station of Russia on the Pacific. The\r\n  trade is in the hands of the Chinese, who export stags' horns, seaweed\r\n  and mushrooms, and of the Germans, who import groceries and spirits.\r\n\r\n  The total population was 209,516 in 1897, of whom 57.7% were Russians,\r\n  the others being Tunguses, Golds, Orochons, Lamuts, Chuvantses,\r\n  Chukchis, Koryaks, Ghilyaks and Kamchadales. Their chief occupations\r\n  are hunting and fishing; the Russians carry on agriculture and trade\r\n  in furs. Active measures were taken in 1883-1897 for increasing the\r\n  Russian population in the South Usuri district, the result being that\r\n  over 29,000 immigrants, chiefly Little Russian peasants, settled\r\n  there; while Cossacks from the Don and Orenburg came to settle among\r\n  the Usuri Cossacks. Agriculture is gradually developing in the South\r\n  Usuri region. Gold-mining has been started on the Amguñ, a tributary\r\n  of the Amur. Coal is found near Vladivostok, as well as in Kamchatka.\r\n  Roads exist only in the South Usuri district. A railway runs from\r\n  Vladivostok to Nikolsk (69 m.), and thence to Khabarovsk along the\r\n  right bank of the Usuri (412 m.). At Nikolsk the Manchurian railway\r\n  begins.     (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARITIME TERRITORY, a term used in international law to denote coastal\r\nwaters which are not Territorial Waters though in immediate contact with\r\nthe sea. In the case of Territorial Waters (q.v.) the dominion of the\r\nadjacent state is subject to a limitation. Dominion over maritime\r\nterritory is not subject to any limitation. Thus any strait through\r\nwhich the right of passage of foreign vessels can be forbidden (as the\r\nSolent or the Inland Sea of Japan), or bays so land-locked that they\r\ncannot be held to form part of any ocean-highway, are maritime\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIUPOL, a seaport of Russia, on the north shore of the Sea of Azov, at\r\nthe mouth of the Kalmius, in the government of Ekaterinoslav, 67 m. W.\r\nof Taganrog. Pop. (1900), 52,770, including the inhabitants of two\r\nsuburbs, Mariinsk and Kara-su. The place is said to have been inhabited\r\nin remote times under the name of Adamakha; the present town was built\r\nonly in 1779, by Greek emigrants from the Crimea. Its inhabitants are\r\nengaged in agriculture, cattle-breeding, fishing, and the manufacture of\r\nleather, agricultural implements, iron goods and bricks. In export trade\r\nMariupol ranks next to Taganrog among the ports of the Sea of Azov; but\r\nits harbour is open to the south-east and shallow, though it is being\r\ngradually deepened by systematic dredging. The principal articles of\r\nexport are cereals, with some oilcake, phosphate and coal; but the total\r\nvalue is only about £2,000,000 annually. The imports do not reach a\r\nquarter of a million sterling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIUS OF AVENCHES (or AVENTICUM) (d. 593 or 594), chronicler and\r\necclesiastic, was born in the neighbourhood of Autun probably in 530,\r\nand became bishop of Avenches about 573. In addition to being a good\r\nbishop, Marius was a clever goldsmith; he was present at the council of\r\nMâcon in 585, and transferred the seat of his bishopric from Avenches to\r\nLausanne. He died on the 31st of December 593 or 594. As a continuation\r\nof the _Chronicon_ of Prosper of Aquitaine, Marius wrote a short\r\n_Chronicon_ dealing with the period from 455 to 581; and although he\r\nborrowed from various sources his work has some importance for the\r\nhistory of Burgundy. Regarding himself and his land as still under the\r\nauthority of the Roman empire, he dates his _Chronicon_ according to the\r\nyears of the Roman consuls and of the East Roman emperors.\r\n\r\n  The only extant manuscript of the _Chronicon_ is in the British\r\n  Museum. Among several editions may be mentioned the one in the\r\n  _Monumenta Germaniae historica, chronica minora_, Band II. (1893),\r\n  with introduction by T. Mommsen. See also W. Arndt, _Bischof Marius\r\n  von Aventicum_ (Leipzig, 1875); and W. Wattenbach, _Deutschlands\r\n  Geschichtsquellen_, Bd. I. (1904).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARIUS, GAIUS (155-86 B.C.), Roman general, of plebeian descent, the son\r\nof a small farmer of Cereatae (mod. _Casamare_, \"home of Marius\") near\r\nArpinum. He served first in Spain under the great Scipio Africanus, and\r\nrose from the ranks to be an officer. In 119 as tribune he proposed a\r\nlaw intended to limit the influence of the nobles at elections. This\r\nbrought him into conflict with the aristocratic party, who prevented him\r\nfrom obtaining the aedileship. When about forty years of age he married\r\na lady of patrician rank, Julia, the aunt of Julius Caesar. This gave\r\nhim a new social status, and being at the same time a popular favourite\r\nand a brave, energetic soldier, he was in 115 elected praetor, in which\r\ncapacity he effected the subjugation of the troublesome province of\r\nFurther Spain. In the war with Jugurtha (109-106) he came to the front\r\nas lieutenant of the consul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus. When\r\nhe had already achieved some important successes over Jugurtha (q.v.),\r\nin 107 he was elected consul for the first time (an almost unheard-of\r\nhonour for a \"new man\"), his popularity with the army and people being\r\nsufficient to bear down all opposition. In the following year, in\r\nconjunction with Sulla, he brought the war to a triumphant issue, and\r\npassed two years in his province of Numidia, which he thoroughly subdued\r\nand annexed. The surrender of the person of Jugurtha to Sulla gave rise\r\nto the view that he, not Marius, had really ended the war, and so laid\r\nthe foundation of the subsequent enmity between the two leaders.\r\n\r\nBy this time Marius was generally recognized as the ablest general of\r\nthe day, and was appointed to the chief command against the Cimbri and\r\nTeutones. Two Roman armies had been destroyed near the Lake of Geneva,\r\nand it seemed as if a repetition of the disaster of the Allia and the\r\ncapture of Rome itself might not be impossible. Marius, out of\r\nunpromising materials and a demoralized soldiery, organized a\r\nwell-disciplined army, with which he inflicted on the invaders two\r\ndecisive defeats, the first in 102 at Aquae Sextiae (_Aix_), 18 m. north\r\nof Marseilles, and the second in the following year on the Raudian plain\r\nnear Vercellae (_Vercelli_), about midway between Turin and Milan. For\r\nsome centuries afterwards Rome remained unmolested by northern\r\nbarbarians. In 101 Marius was elected consul a fifth time (previously in\r\n107, 104, 103, 102), hailed as the \"saviour of his country,\" and\r\nhonoured with a triumph of unprecedented splendour.\r\n\r\nThe glorious part of his career was now over. Though a very able\r\nsoldier, he was without the intellectual culture which the Gracchi, his\r\npolitical ancestors, possessed. As a politician he on the whole failed,\r\nthough he retained the confidence of the popular party almost to the\r\nlast. But he unfortunately associated himself with the demagogues\r\n_Saturninus_ (q.v.) and Glaucia, in order to secure the consulship for\r\nthe sixth time (100). The manner in which he turned against his former\r\nassociates (although he probably had no choice in the matter) alienated\r\nthe sympathies of the plebs; and Marius, feeling that his only chance of\r\nrehabilitation lay in war, left Rome for Asia, where he endeavoured to\r\nprovoke Mithradates to hostilities. On his return he served as legate in\r\nthe Social War (90), and defeated the Marsi on two occasions. In 88 war\r\nbroke out with Mithradates, and Sulla was appointed by the senate to the\r\nchief command, which was eagerly desired by Marius. This led to a\r\nrupture. With the assistance of the tribune Sulpicius Rufus, Marius\r\nsucceeded in getting the command transferred to himself. Sulla marched\r\nupon Rome and defeated Marius, who fled to the marshes of Minturnae in\r\nLatium. He was discovered and taken prisoner; and the local magistrates,\r\nin accordance with Sulla's proclamation, resolved to put him to death.\r\nThe Gallic trooper sent to strike off the old man's head quailed, it is\r\nsaid, before the fire of his eyes, and fled exclaiming, \"I cannot kill\r\nGaius Marius.\" The inhabitants out of compassion then allowed Marius to\r\ndepart, and put him on board a ship which conveyed him to Carthage. When\r\nforbidden to land, he told the messenger to inform the governor that he\r\nhad seen Marius sitting as a fugitive among the ruins of Carthage.\r\nHaving been joined by his son, he took refuge in the island of Cercina.\r\nMeantime, Sulla having left Italy for the Mithradatic war, Cinna's\r\nsudden and violent revolution put the senate at the mercy of the popular\r\nleaders, and Marius greedily caught at the opportunity of a bloody\r\nvengeance, which became in fact a reign of terror in which senators and\r\nnobles were slaughtered wholesale. He had himself elected consul for the\r\nseventh time, in fulfilment of a prophecy given to him in early manhood.\r\nLess than three weeks afterwards he died of fever, on the 13th of\r\nJanuary 86.\r\n\r\nMarius was not only a great general, but also a great military reformer.\r\nFrom his time a citizen militia was replaced by a professional soldiery,\r\nwhich had hitherto been little liked by the Roman people. He further\r\nmade the cohort the military unit instead of the maniple, and his\r\ncavalry and light-armed troops were drawn from foreign countries, so\r\nthat it may be said that Marius was the originator of the mercenary\r\narmy. The Roman soldier was henceforth a man who had no trade but war. A\r\ngreat general could hardly fail to become the foremost man in the state.\r\nMarius, however, unlike Caesar, did not attempt to overturn the\r\noligarchy by means of the army; he used rather such expedients as the\r\nconstitution seemed to allow, though they had to be backed up by riot\r\nand violence. He failed as a political reformer because the merchants\r\nand the moneyed classes, whom the Gracchi had tried to conciliate,\r\nfeared that they would themselves be swept away by a revolution of which\r\nthe mob and its leaders would be the ultimate controllers. Marius had a\r\ndecided tinge of fanaticism and superstition. In canvassing for the\r\nconsulship he was guided by the counsels of an Etruscan soothsayer, and\r\nwas accompanied in his campaigns by a Syrian prophetess. The fashionable\r\naccomplishments of the day, and the new Greek culture, were wholly alien\r\nto his taste.\r\n\r\n  For the life of Marius the original sources are numerous passages in\r\n  Cicero's works, Sallust's _Jugurtha_, the epitomes of the lost books\r\n  of Livy, Plutarch's _Lives_ of Sulla and Marius, Velleius Paterculus,\r\n  Florus and Appian's _Bellum civite_. See F. D. Gerlach, _Marius und\r\n  Sulla_ (Basel, 1856); I. Gilles, _Campagne de Marius dans la Gaule_\r\n  (1870); W. Votsch, _Marius als Reformator des römischen Heerwesens_\r\n  (with notes and references to ancient authorities, 1886); A. H. J.\r\n  Greenidge, _History of Rome_, vol. i.

His father was\r\na financier of Norman extraction whose real name was Carlet, but who\r\nassumed the surname of Chamblain, and then superadded that of Marivaux.\r\nM. Carlet de Marivaux was a man of good reputation, and he received the\r\nappointment of director of the mint at Riom in Auvergne, where and at\r\nLimoges the young Pierre was brought up. It is said that he developed\r\nliterary tastes early, and wrote his first play, the _Père prudent et\r\néquitable_, when he was only eighteen; it was not, however, published\r\ntill 1712, when he was twenty-four. His chief attention in those early\r\ndays was paid to novel writing, not the drama. In the three years from\r\n1713 to 1715 he produced three novels--_Effets surprenants de la\r\nsympathie_; _La Voiture embourbée_, and a book which had three\r\ntitles--_Pharsamon_, _Les Folies romanesques_, and _Le Don Quichotte\r\nmoderne_. All these books were in a curious strain, not in the least\r\nresembling the pieces which long afterwards were to make his reputation,\r\nbut following partly the Spanish romances and partly the heroic novels\r\nof the preceding century, with a certain intermixture of the marvellous.\r\nThen Marivaux's literary ardour took a new phase. He fell under the\r\ninfluence of Antoine Hondar [d] de La Motte, and thought to serve the\r\ncause of that ingenious paradoxer by travestying Homer, an ignoble task,\r\nwhich he followed up (perhaps, for it is not certain) by performing the\r\nsame office in regard to Fénelon. His friendship for La Motte, however,\r\nintroduced him to the _Mercure_, the chief newspaper of France, where in\r\n1717 he produced various articles of the \"Spectator\" kind, which were\r\ndistinguished by much keenness of observation and not a little literary\r\nskill. It was at this time that the peculiar style called Marivaudage\r\nfirst made its appearance in him. The year 1720 and those immediately\r\nfollowing were very important ones for Marivaux; not only did he produce\r\na comedy, now lost except in small part, entitled _L'Amour et la\r\nvérité_, and another and far better one entitled _Arlequin poli par\r\nl'amour_, but he wrote a tragedy, _Annibal_ (printed 1737), which was\r\nand deserved to be unsuccessful. Meanwhile his worldly affairs underwent\r\na sudden revolution. His father had left him a comfortable subsistence,\r\nbut he was persuaded by friends to risk it in the Mississippi scheme,\r\nand after vastly increasing it for a time lost all that he had. His\r\nprosperity had enabled him to marry (perhaps in 1721) a certain Mlle\r\nMartin, of whom much good is said, and to whom he was deeply attached,\r\nbut who died very shortly. His pen now became almost his sole resource.\r\nHe had a connexion with both the fashionable theatres, for his _Annibal_\r\nhad been played at the Comédie Française and his _Arlequin poli_ at the\r\nComédie Italienne, where at the time a company who were extremely\r\npopular, despite their imperfect command of French, were established. He\r\nendeavoured too to turn his newspaper practice in the _Mercure_ to more\r\naccount by starting a weekly _Spectateur Français_ (1722-1723), to which\r\nhe was the sole contributor. But his habits were the reverse of\r\nmethodical; the paper appeared at the most irregular intervals; and,\r\nthough it contained some excellent work, its irregularity killed it. For\r\nnearly twenty years the theatre, and especially the Italian theatre, was\r\nMarivaux's chief support, for his pieces, though they were not ill\r\nreceived by the actors at the Français, were rarely successful there.\r\nThe best of a very large number of plays (Marivaux's theatre numbers\r\nbetween thirty and forty items) were the _Surprise de l'amour_ (1722),\r\nthe _Triomphe de Plutus_ (1728), the _Jeu de l'amour et du hasard_\r\n(1730), _Les Fausses confidences_ (1737), all produced at the Italian\r\ntheatre, and _Le Legs_ (1736), produced at the French. Meanwhile he had\r\nat intervals returned to both his other lines of composition. A\r\nperiodical publication called _L'Indigent philosophe_ appeared in 1727,\r\nand another called _Le Cabinet du philosophe_ in 1734, but the same\r\ncauses which had proved fatal to the _Spectateur_ prevented these later\r\nefforts from succeeding. In 1731 Marivaux published the first two parts\r\nof his best and greatest work, _Marianne_, a novel of a new and\r\nremarkable kind. The eleven parts appeared in batches at intervals\r\nduring a period of exactly the same number of years, and after all it\r\nwas left unfinished. In 1735 another novel, _Le Paysan parvenu_, was\r\nbegun, but this also was left unfinished. He was elected a member of the\r\nAcademy in 1742. He survived for more than twenty years, and was not\r\nidle, again contributing occasionally to the _Mercure_, writing plays,\r\n\"reflections\" (which were seldom of much worth), and so forth. He died\r\non the 12th February 1763, aged seventy-five years.\r\n\r\n  The personal character of Marivaux was curious and somewhat\r\n  contradictory, though not without analogies, one of the closest of\r\n  which is to be found in Goldsmith. He was, however, unlike Goldsmith,\r\n  at least as brilliant in conversation as with the pen. He was\r\n  extremely good-natured, but fond of saying very severe things,\r\n  unhesitating in his acceptance of favours (he drew a regular annuity\r\n  from Helvetius), but exceedingly touchy if he thought himself in any\r\n  way slighted. He was, though a great cultivator of _sensibilité_, on\r\n  the whole decent and moral in his writings, and was unsparing in his\r\n  criticism of the rising _Philosophes_. This last circumstance, and\r\n  perhaps jealousy as well, made him a dangerous enemy in Voltaire, who\r\n  lost but few opportunities of speaking disparagingly of him. He had\r\n  good friends, not merely in the rich, generous and amiable Helvetius,\r\n  but in Mme de Tencin, in Fontenelle and even in Mme de Pompadour, who\r\n  gave him, it is said, a considerable pension, of the source of which\r\n  he was ignorant. His extreme sensitiveness is shown by many stories.\r\n  He had one daughter, who took the veil, the duke of Orleans, the\r\n  regent's successor, furnishing her with her dowry.\r\n\r\n  The so-called Marivaudage is the main point of importance about\r\n  Marivaux's literary work, though the best of the comedies have great\r\n  merits, and _Marianne_ is an extremely important step in the\r\n  legitimate development of the French novel--legitimate, that is, in\r\n  opposition to the brilliant but episodic productions of Le Sage. Its\r\n  connexion, and that of _Le Paysan parvenu_, with the work not only of\r\n  Richardson but of Fielding is also an interesting though a difficult\r\n  subject. The subject matter of Marivaux's peculiar style has been\r\n  generally and with tolerable exactness described as the metaphysic of\r\n  love-making. His characters, in a happy phrase of Claude Prosper\r\n  Jolyot Crébillon's, not only tell each other and the reader everything\r\n  they have thought, but everything that they would like to persuade\r\n  themselves that they have thought. The style chosen for this is justly\r\n  regarded as derived mainly from Fontenelle, and through him from the\r\n  Précieuses, though there are traces of it even in La Bruyère. It\r\n  abuses metaphor somewhat, and delights to turn off a metaphor itself\r\n  in some unexpected and bizarre fashion. Now it is a familiar phrase\r\n  which is used where dignified language would be expected; now the\r\n  reverse. In the criticism of Crébillon's already quoted occurs another\r\n  happy description of Marivaux's style as being \"an introduction to\r\n  each other of words which have never made acquaintance, and which\r\n  think that they will not get on together,\" a phrase as happy in its\r\n  imitation as in its satire of the style itself. This kind of writing,\r\n  of course, recurs at several periods of literature, and did so\r\n  remarkably at the end of the 19th century in more countries than one.\r\n  Yet this fantastic embroidery of language has a certain charm, and\r\n  suits perhaps better than any other style the somewhat unreal\r\n  gallantry and _sensibilité_ which it describes and exhibits. The\r\n  author possessed, moreover, both thought and observation, besides\r\n  considerable command of pathos.\r\n\r\n  The best and most complete edition of Marivaux is that of 1781 in 12\r\n  vols. reprinted with additions 1825-1830. The plays had been published\r\n  during the author's lifetime in 1740 and 1748. There are modern\r\n  editions by Paul de Saint Heylli Victor (1863), by G. d'Heylli (1876)\r\n  and by E. Fournier (1878), while issues of selections and separate\r\n  plays and novels are numerous. Of works concerning him J. Fleury's\r\n  _Marivaux et le Marivaudage_ (Paris, 1881), G. Larroumet's _Marivaux,\r\n  sa vie et ses oeuvres_ (1882; new ed., 1894), the standard work on the\r\n  subject, and G. Deschamps's _Marivaux_ (1897), in the _Grands\r\n  écrivains français_, are the most important. Separate articles on him\r\n  will be found in the collected essays of the chief modern French\r\n  critics from Sainte-Beuve onwards.     (G. Sa.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARJORAM, (O. Fr. _majorane_, Med. Lat. _majorana_; not connected with\r\n_major_, greater, nor with _amaracus_), in botany, the common name for\r\nsome aromatic herbs or undershrubs, belonging to the genus _Origanum_\r\n(natural order Labiatae). Wild marjoram is _O. vulgare_, a perennial\r\ncommon in England in dry copses and on hedge-banks, with many stout\r\nstems 1 to 3 ft. high, bearing short-stalked somewhat ovate leaves and\r\nclusters of purple flowers. Sweet or knotted marjoram, _O. Marjorana_,\r\nand pot marjoram, _O. Onites_, are cultivated for the use of their\r\naromatic leaves, either green or dry, for culinary purposes; the tops\r\nare cut as the plants begin to flower and are dried slowly in the shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK, ST, the traditional author of the second Gospel. His name occurs\r\nin several books of the New Testament, and doubtless refers in all cases\r\nto the same person, though this has been questioned. In the Acts of the\r\nApostles (xii. 12) we read of \"John, whose surname was Mark,\" and gather\r\nthat Peter was a familiar visitor at the house of his mother Mary, which\r\nwas a centre of Christian life in Jerusalem. That he was, as his Roman\r\nsurname would suggest, a Hellenist, follows from the fact that he was\r\nalso cousin (\"nephew\" is a later sense of [Greek: anepsios], see J. B.\r\nLightfoot on Col. iv. 10) of Barnabas, who belonged to Cyprus. When\r\nBarnabas and Paul returned from their relief visit to Judaea (c. A.D.\r\n46), Mark accompanied them (xii. 25). Possibly he had shown in connexion\r\nwith their relief work that practical capacity which seems to have been\r\nhis distinctive excellence (cf. 2 Tim. iv. 11). When, not long after,\r\nthey started on a joint mission beyond Syria, Mark went as their\r\nassistant, undertaking the minor personal duties connected with travel,\r\nas well as with their work proper (xiii. 5). As soon, however, as their\r\nplans developed, after leaving Cyprus and on arrival at Perga in\r\nPamphylia (see PAUL), Mark withdrew, probably on some matter of\r\nprinciple, and returned to Jerusalem (xiii. 13). When, then, Paul\r\nproposed, after the Jerusalem council of Acts xv., to revisit with\r\nBarnabas the scenes of their joint labours, he naturally demurred to\r\ntaking Mark with them again, feeling that he could not be relied on\r\nshould fresh openings demand a new policy. But Barnabas stood by his\r\nyounger kinsman and \"took Mark and sailed away to Cyprus\" (xv. 38 seq.).\r\nBarnabas does not reappear, unless we trust the tradition which makes\r\nhim an evangelist in Alexandria (Clem. _Hom._ i. 9 seq., cf. the\r\nattribution to him of the Alexandrine _Epistle of Barnabas_).\r\n\r\nWhen Mark appears once more, it is in Paul's company at Rome, as a\r\nfellow-worker joining in salutations to Christians at Colossae (Col. iv.\r\n10; Philem. 24). We gather, too, that his restoration to Paul's\r\nconfidence took place some time earlier, as the Colossians had already\r\nbeen bidden by oral message or letter to welcome him if he should visit\r\nthem. This points to a reconciliation during Paul's last sojourn in\r\nJerusalem or Caesarea. Not long after Col. iv. 10 Mark seems to have\r\nbeen sent by Paul to some place in the province of Asia, lying on the\r\nroute between Ephesus and Rome. For in 2 Tim. iv. 11 Paul bids Timothy,\r\n\"Pick up Mark and bring him with thee, for he is useful to me for\r\nministering.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more Mark's name occurs in the New Testament, this time with yet\r\nanother leader, Peter, the friend of his earliest Christian years in\r\nJerusalem, to whom he attached himself after the deaths of Barnabas and\r\nPaul. Peter's words, \"Mark, my son,\" show how close was the spiritual\r\ntie between the older and the younger man (1 Pet. v. 13); and as he is\r\nwriting from Rome (\"Babylon,\" since Paul's death and the change of\r\npolicy it implied), this forms a link between the New Testament and\r\nearly tradition, which speaks of Mark as an Evangelist writing his\r\nGospel under the influence of Peter's preaching (in Rome). This is the\r\nessence of the tradition preserved from \"the elders of former days\" by\r\nClement of Alexandria (in Eus. ii. 15, vi. 14), a tradition probably\r\nbased on Papias's record (cf. Eus. iii. 39) of the explanation given by\r\n\"the Elder\" (John) as to the contrast in form between Mark's memoirs of\r\nPeter's discourses and the Gospel of Matthew (see GOSPELS; PAPIAS), but\r\ndefining the place where these memoirs were written as Rome. That he\r\nacted to some degree as Peter's interpreter or dragoman ([Greek:\r\nhermêneus]), owing to the apostle's imperfect mastery of Greek, is held\r\nby some but denied by others (e.g. by Zahn). His rôle throughout his\r\ncareer was _servus servorum dei_; and the fact that he was this\r\nsuccessively to Barnabas, Paul and Peter, helps to show the essential\r\nharmony of their message.\r\n\r\nThe identification of the author of the second Gospel with Mark, which\r\nwe owe to tradition, enables us to fill in our picture of him a little\r\nfurther. Thus it is possible that Mark was himself the youth ([Greek:\r\nneaniskos]) to whom his Gospel refers as present at Jesus's arrest (xiv.\r\n51 seq.; cf. his detailed knowledge as to the place of the last supper,\r\n13 seq.). It is probably as evangelist, and not in his own person, that\r\nhe became known as \"he of the stunted extremities\" ([Greek:\r\nkolobodaktulos], \"curt-fingered\"), a title first found in Hippolytus\r\n(_Haer._ vii. 30), in a context which makes its metaphorical reference\r\nto his Gospel pretty evident.[1] It was too as evangelist that he became\r\npersonally a subject of later interest, and of speculative legends due\r\nto this, e.g. he was one of the Seventy (first found in Adamantius,\r\n_Dial. de recta fide_, 4th century), he was the founder of the\r\nAlexandrine Church (recorded as a tradition by Eusebius, ii. 16) and its\r\nfirst bishop (id. ii. 2), and was author of the local type of liturgy\r\n(cf. the _Acts of Mark_, ch. vii., not earlier than the end of the 4th\r\ncentury).\r\n\r\nAs to his last days and death nothing is really known. It is\r\npossible--even probable, if we accept the theory that he had already[2]\r\nbeen there with Barnabas--that Alexandria was his final sphere of work,\r\nas the earliest tradition on the point implies (the Latin _Prologue_,\r\nand Eusebius as above, probably after Julius Africanus in the early 3rd\r\ncentury), and as was widely assumed in the 4th century. That he died and\r\nwas buried there is first stated by Jerome (_De vir. ill._ 8), to which\r\nhis _Acts_ adds the glory of martyrdom (cf. Ps.-Hippolytus, _De LXX\r\nApostolis_).\r\n\r\n  LITERATURE.--H. B. Swete, _The Gospel acc. to St Mark_ (1898),\r\n  Introduction, § I., where the authorities are fully cited; also the\r\n  art. in Hastings's _Dict. Bible_. The Patristic and other legends are\r\n  discussed at length by R. A. Lipsius, _Die apokr. Apostelgesch.\r\n  u.s.w._ (1884), ii. 2, and T. Schermann, _Propheten- und\r\n  Apostellegenden_ (1907), 285 seq. (with special reference to\r\n  Ps.-Hippolytus and Ps.-Dorotheus).     (J. V. B.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Medieval Legends._\r\n\r\n  The majority of medieval writers on the subject state that Mark was a\r\n  Levite; but this is probably no more than an inference from his\r\n  supposed relationship to Barnabas. The Alexandrian tradition seems to\r\n  have been that he was of Cyrenaean origin; and Severus, a writer of\r\n  the 10th century, adds to this the statement that his father's name\r\n  was Aristobulus, who, with his wife Mary, was driven from the\r\n  Pentapolis to Jerusalem by an invasion of barbarians (Severus\r\n  Aschimon in Renaudot, _Hist. patriarch. alex._, p. 2). In the\r\n  apocryphal Acts of Barnabas, which profess to be written by him, he\r\n  speaks of himself as having been formerly a servant of Cyrillus, the\r\n  high priest of Zeus, and as having been baptized at Iconium. The\r\n  presbyter John, whom Papias quotes, says distinctly that \"he neither\r\n  heard the Lord nor accompanied Him\" (Eusebius, _loc. cit._); and this\r\n  positive statement is fatal to the tradition, which does not appear\r\n  until about two hundred and fifty years afterwards, that he was one of\r\n  the seventy disciples (Epiphanius, pseudo-Origen _De recta in Deum\r\n  fide_, and the author of the _Paschal Chronicle_). Various other\r\n  results of the tendency to fill up blank names in the gospel history\r\n  must be set aside on the same ground; it was, for example, believed\r\n  that Mark was one of the disciples who \"went back\" because of the\r\n  \"hard saying\" (pseudo-Hippolyt., _De LXX Apostolis_ in Cod. Barocc.\r\n  Migne, _Patrol. graec._ x. 955); there was an Alexandrian tradition\r\n  that he was one of the servants at the miracle of Cana of Galilee,\r\n  that he was the \"man bearing a pitcher of water\" in whose house the\r\n  last supper was prepared, and that he was also the owner of the house\r\n  in which the disciples met on the evening of the resurrection\r\n  (Renaudot, _loc. cit._); and even in modern times there has been the\r\n  conjecture that he was the \"certain young man\" who \"fled naked\" from\r\n  Gethsemane, Mark xiv. 51, 52 (Olshausen).\r\n\r\n  A tradition which was widely diffused, and which is not in itself\r\n  improbable, was that he afterwards preached the gospel and presided\r\n  over the church at Alexandria (the earliest extant testimony is that\r\n  of Eusebius, _H. E._ ii. 16, 1; ii. 24; for the fully-developed legend\r\n  of later times see Symeon Metaphrastes, _Vita S. Marci_, and Eutychius\r\n  _Origines ecclesiae Alexandrinae_). There was another, though perhaps\r\n  not incompatible, tradition that he preached the gospel and presided\r\n  over the church at Aquileia in North Italy. The earliest testimony in\r\n  favour of this tradition is the vague statement of Gregory of\r\n  Nazianzus that Mark preached in Italy, but its existence in the 7th\r\n  century is shown by the fact that in A.D. 629 Heraclius sent the\r\n  patriarchal chair from Alexandria to Grado, to which city the\r\n  patriarchate of Aquileia had been then transferred (_Chron. patriarch.\r\n  Gradens._, in Ughelli, _Italia sacra_, tom. v. p. 1086; for other\r\n  references to the general tradition see De Rubeis, _Monum. eccles.\r\n  aquileien._, c. 1; _Acta sanctorum_, ad April, xxv.). It was through\r\n  this tradition that Mark became connected with Venice, whither the\r\n  patriarchate was further transferred from Grado; an early Venetian\r\n  legend, which is represented in the Cappella Zen in the basilica of St\r\n  Mark, antedates this connexion by picturing the evangelist as having\r\n  been stranded on the Rialto, while it was still an uninhabited island,\r\n  and as having had the future greatness of the city revealed to him\r\n  (Danduli, _Chron._ iv. 1, ap. Muratori, _Rer. ital. script._ xii. 14).\r\n\r\n  The earliest traditions appear to imply that he died a natural death\r\n  (Eusebius, Jerome, and even Isidore of Seville); but the Martyrologies\r\n  claim him as a martyr, though they do not agree as to the manner of\r\n  his martyrdom. According to the pseudo-Hippolytus he was burned; but\r\n  Symeon Metaphrastes and the _Paschal Chronicle_ represent him to have\r\n  been dragged over rough stones until he died. But, however that may\r\n  be, his tomb appears to have been venerated at Alexandria, and there\r\n  was a firm belief at Venice in the middle ages that his remains had\r\n  been translated thither in the 9th century (the fact of the\r\n  translation is denied even by Tillemont; the weakness of the evidence\r\n  in support of the tradition is apparent even in Molini's vigorous\r\n  defence of it, lib. ii. c. 2; the minute account which the same writer\r\n  gives, lib., ii. c. 11, of the discovery of the supposed actual bones\r\n  of the evangelist in A.D. 1811, is interesting). There was another\r\n  though less widely accepted tradition, that the remains soon after\r\n  their translation to Venice were retranslated to the abbey of\r\n  Reichenau on Lake Constance; a circumstantial account of this\r\n  retranslation is given in the treatise _Ex miraculis S. Marci_, in\r\n  Pertz, _Mon. hist. german. script._, tom. iv. p. 449. It may be added\r\n  that the Venetians prided themselves on possessing, not only the body\r\n  of St Mark, but also the autograph of his Gospel; this autograph,\r\n  however, proved on examination to be only part of a 6th-century book\r\n  of the Gospels, the remainder of which was published by Bianchini as\r\n  the _Evangeliarium forojuliense_; the Venetian part of this MS. was\r\n  found some years ago to have been wholly destroyed by damp.\r\n\r\n  It has been at various times supposed that Mark wrote other works\r\n  besides the Gospel. Several books of the New Testament have been\r\n  attributed to him: viz. the Epistle to the Hebrews (Spanheim, _Op.\r\n  miscell._ ii. 240), the Epistle of Jude (cf. Holtzmann, _Die\r\n  synoptischen Evangelien_, p. 373), the Apocalypse (Hitzig, _Ueber\r\n  Johannes Marcus_, Zürich, 1843). The apocryphal _Acta Barnabae_\r\n  purport to have been written by him. There is a liturgy which bears\r\n  his name, and which exists in two forms; the one form was found in a\r\n  MS. of the 12th century in Calabria, and is, according to Renaudot,\r\n  the foundation of the three liturgies of St Basil, St Gregory\r\n  Nazianzen and St Cyril; the other is that which is used by the\r\n  Maronite and Jacobite Syrians. Both forms have been published by\r\n  Renaudot, _Liturg. oriental. collect_, i. 127, and ii. 176, and in\r\n  Neale's _History of the Holy Eastern Church_; but neither has any\r\n  substantial claim to belong to the ante-Nicene period of Christian\r\n  literature.\r\n\r\n  The symbol by which Mark is designated in Christian art is usually\r\n  that of a lion. Each of the \"four living creatures\" of Ezekiel and the\r\n  Apocalypse has been attributed to each of the four evangelists in\r\n  turn; Augustine and Bede think that Mark is designated by the \"man\";\r\n  Theophylact and others think that he is designated by the eagle;\r\n  Anastasius Sinaita makes his symbol the ox; but medieval art\r\n  acquiesced in the opinion of Jerome that he was indicated by the lion.\r\n  Most of the martyrologies and calendars assign April 25 as the day on\r\n  which he should be commemorated; but the _Martyr. Hieron._ gives the\r\n  23rd of September, and some Greek martyrologies give the 11th of\r\n  January. This unusual variation probably arises from early differences\r\n  of opinion as to whether there was one Mark or more than one.\r\n\r\n  See Canon Molini of Venice, _De vita et lipsanis S. Marci\r\n  Evangelistae_, edited, after the author's death, by S. Pieralisi, the\r\n  librarian of the Barberini library (1864); R. A. Lipsius, _Die\r\n  apokryphen Apostelgesch. und Apostellegenden_ (1883 foll). vol. ii.\r\n  part 2, pp. 321-353.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] The divergent lines of the later attempts at a literal\r\n    interpretation--e.g. he amputated his thumb in order to escape the\r\n    Levitical priesthood (Latin _Prologue_), or it was a natural defect\r\n    (_Cod. Tolet._)--suggest that all they had to start from was the\r\n    epithet itself.\r\n\r\n  [2] Nicephorus Callistus, _Hist. Eccl._ ii. 43, assumes this in his\r\n    picturesque account of Mark's preaching in a quarter of the city\r\n    which seems to have contained the tomb of the early bishops of\r\n    Alexandria (cf. his _Acts_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK, a word of which the principal meanings are in their probable order\r\nof development,--boundary, an object set up to indicate a boundary or\r\nposition; hence a sign or token, impression or trace. The word in O.\r\nEng. is _mearc_, and appears in all Teutonic languages, cf. Du. _merk_,\r\nGer. _Mark_, boundary, _marke_, sign, impression; Romanic languages have\r\nborrowed the word, cf. Fr. _marque_, Ital. _marca_. Cognate forms\r\noutside Teutonic have been found in Lat. _margo_, \"margin,\" and Pers.\r\n_marz_, boundary. Others would refer to the Lith. _margas_, striped,\r\nparti-coloured, and Sanskrit _marga_, trace, especially of hunted game.\r\nIn the sense of boundary, or a tract of country on or near a boundary or\r\nfrontier, \"mark\" in English usage proper is obsolete, and \"march\" (q.v.)\r\nhas established itself. It still remains, however, to represent the\r\nGerman _mark_, a tract of land held in common by a village community\r\n(see MARK SYSTEM), and also historically the name of certain\r\nprincipalities, such as the mark of Brandenburg. The Italian _marca_ is\r\nalso sometimes rendered by \"mark,\" as in the mark of Ancona.\r\n\r\nMark is also the name of a modern silver coin of the German empire. This\r\nis apparently a distinct word and not of Teutonic origin; it is found in\r\nall Teutonic and Romanic languages, Latinized as _marca_ or _marcus_.\r\nThe mark was originally a measure of weight only for gold and silver and\r\nwas common throughout western Europe and was equivalent to 8 oz. The\r\nvariations, however, throughout the middle ages were considerable (see\r\nDu Cange, _Gloss. med. et infim. Lat., s.v. Marca_ for a full list). In\r\nEngland the \"mark\" was never a coin, but a money of account only, and\r\napparently came into use in the 10th century through the Danes. It first\r\nwas taken as equal to 100 pennies, but after the Norman Conquest was\r\nequal to 160 pennies (20 pennies to the oz.) = 2/3 of the pound\r\nsterling, or 13s. 4d., and therefore in Scotland 13½d. English; the mark\r\n(merk) Scots was a silver coin of this value, issued first in 1570 and\r\nafterwards in 1663. The modern German _mark_ was adopted in 1873 as the\r\nstandard of value and the money of account. It is of the value of 6.146\r\ngrains of gold, 900 fine, and is equal to English standard gold of the\r\nvalue of 11.747 pence. The modern silver coin, nearly equal in value to\r\nthe English shilling, was first issued in 1875. (See NUMISMATICS, § iv.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK, GOSPEL OF ST, the second of the four canonical Gospels of the\r\nChristian Church. Till quite recent times this Gospel, though nominally\r\nequal to the others in authority, has unquestionably not aroused the\r\nsame interest or feelings of attachment as they have, partly from its\r\nnot bearing the name of an apostle for its author, as the first and\r\nfourth do, partly, also, owing to the fact that the first and third,\r\nwhile they include most of what is found in it, contain much additional\r\nmatter, which is of the highest value. Of late, however, it has acquired\r\nnew importance through the critical inquiries which have led to the\r\nconclusion that the two other synoptic Gospels are based upon it, or\r\nupon a document which is upon the whole most truly represented in it\r\n(see GOSPEL), so that it possesses the advantage of being an earlier\r\nsource of information, or at least of bringing us more fully into\r\ncontact with such a source. The significance of all that we can learn as\r\nto the history of the composition of Mark's Gospel is clearly enhanced\r\nby this consideration.\r\n\r\n(1) _Early Account of a Writing by Mark._--According to a fragment of\r\nPapias (ap. Eus. _Hist. Eccl._ III. 39) taken from a work probably\r\nwritten c. A.D. 140, Mark, who was the follower and interpreter of\r\nPeter, recorded after the latter's decease the words of Christ and the\r\nnarratives of His deeds which he had heard the Apostle deliver, but he\r\ncould not arrange the matter \"in order,\" because he had not himself been\r\na personal follower of Jesus. This account Papias had derived, he tells\r\nus, from an informant who had heard it repeatedly given by \"the elder,\"\r\na Christian of the first generation.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the work to which Papias himself supposed\r\nthis story to apply was the Gospel of Mark virtually as we know it. The\r\ntradition in regard to this work must have been continuous between his\r\ntime and that of Irenaeus, who (c. A.D. 180) gives a similar account of\r\nits composition. It may be noted also that the same view of the origin\r\nof the Gospel of Mark appears to have been held by a contemporary of\r\nPapias, Justin Martyr. In his _Dialogue with Trypho_ (c. 106) he cites a\r\nfact about the name of Peter from \"his Memoirs,\" and adds also another\r\nsimilar fact about the name given to the sons of Zebedee, just as they\r\nare stated in Mark iii. 16, 17, and nowhere else so far as we know. He\r\nmay well have been ready to call the work \"Peter's,\" though he believed\r\nthat Mark actually composed it, on the ground that the latter recorded\r\nwhat the Apostle said (cf. ibid. c. 103).\r\n\r\nBut is our Gospel of Mark also to be identified with the writing by Mark\r\nspoken of by \"the elder\" whose account had been reported to Papias? Some\r\nconfusion is here more conceivable; while, if it is supposed that such a\r\nwriting was worked up in our second Gospel, this may seem sufficient to\r\nexplain the connexion of Mark's name with the latter.\r\n\r\nIn support of this view it is urged, though it is so much less often now\r\nthan it used to be, that the description \"not in order\" does not fit our\r\nGospel of Mark, the order in which is from an historical point of view\r\nas good as, if not better than, in the other Gospels. But from\r\nwhomsoever the expression proceeds--whether from Papias, or his\r\ninformant, or \"the elder\"--we may feel sure that considerations such as\r\nappeal to us from our training in historical criticism are not those\r\nwhich suggested it, but rather the want of agreement between this Gospel\r\nand some standard which on altogether different grounds was applied to\r\nit. This argument, then, for supposing that the original writing by Mark\r\ndiffered widely in form and contents from the Gospel which now bears his\r\nname appears to be without force. The question whether the two differed\r\nto any, and if so to what, extent can be decided only from an\r\nexamination of the Gospel itself.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Question of the Integrity of the Gospel of Mark._--There are in\r\na good many parts of this Gospel indications that the narrative has been\r\nderived from Simon Peter, or some one else who was a personal follower\r\nof Jesus in the days of His earthly ministry. It has been widely felt\r\nthat the account of the call of the first four disciples and of the\r\nevents which immediately followed (i. 15-39) at the opening of the\r\nGalilean ministry, bears strong marks of proceeding from Simon Peter.\r\nOther passages might be pointed out in which it is suitable to suppose\r\nthat this disciple in particular was the informant. But we will content\r\nourselves with noticing signs that the reminiscences of some eyewitness\r\nare recorded. (a) Traits appear which are wholly without importance, and\r\nupon which no stress is laid in the context, but which it was natural\r\nfor a narrator who was actually present, and only for such a one to\r\nintroduce, because he remembered them as associated with the principal\r\nevents. The following are instances and others might be cited: the\r\nmention of \"other boats,\" iv. 36; the half-foolish remark made by Peter\r\nwhen in a dazed condition at the Transfiguration, ix. 5, 6; the young\r\nman who, when Jesus was arrested, followed, \"having a linen cloth cast\r\nabout him,\" xiv. 51, 52; the fact that Simon of Cyrene was \"coming from\r\nthe country,\" xv. 21. (b) There is great truth of local colouring. The\r\nreferences to places and the descriptions of natural features (the\r\nlake-shore, i. 16; ii. 13; iii. 7; the hills near at hand, iii. 13; v.\r\n5, 13; vi. 46; the desert places among the hills or by the shore, i. 35,\r\n45; vi. 31, 32) appear to be accurate; the routes indicated in the\r\njourneys that are taken are probable (vii. 24, 31; viii. 27; x. 17, 32,\r\n46; xi. 1). Again, the term \"village-towns\" (i. 38) is a remarkably\r\nappropriate one (cf. Josephus, B. I. III. iii. 2). There would, indeed,\r\nbe an exception to the general correctness of the topography if we were\r\ncompelled to suppose that \"country of the Gerasenes\" (which is the best\r\nreading according to existing MS. evidence at Mark v. 1) must mean the\r\nterritory of the city of Gerasa. But it is easy to imagine that some\r\nconfusion may have arisen in the transliteration of the name into Greek,\r\nand that the place really indicated is Khersa, near the middle of the\r\neastern shore of the lake. The pair of references (vi. 45, 53) which\r\nmight also be adduced as an exception, will be noticed below. Further,\r\nthe conditions of life and thought in Palestine at the time in question\r\nare faithfully represented, Aramaic words spoken on some important\r\noccasions are preserved (iii. 17; v. 41; xv. 34). And, to mention a\r\npoint of a different kind, the parts played by different sections among\r\nthe Jewish people are such as might be expected. The point of view of\r\nspeakers and actors is throughout that belonging to the time of the\r\nministry of Jesus, not to that when the Christian Church had come into\r\nexistence. (c) The good order in this Gospel, i.e. the natural\r\ndevelopment of the narrative, will be indicated below. It has without\r\ngood reason, as we have seen, been supposed to show that it cannot be\r\nthe record by Mark referred to by Papias. And in reality it would be\r\ndifficult to account for this feature except on the supposition that one\r\nwho had lived through the events had been accustomed, when required to\r\ngive a comprehensive sketch of the history of the ministry and\r\nsufferings of Jesus, to relate the facts in the main as they happened;\r\nand that a hearer of his has to a considerable extent reproduced them in\r\nthe same order.\r\n\r\nThe last consideration seems to show that the general form and structure\r\nof the Gospel, and not merely certain portions of it, are original. In\r\npoint of style, also, there is a large amount of uniformity. The chief\r\nexceptions are that, whereas some incidents are related in a very\r\nconcise manner (e.g. i. 23-28, and 40-45), there is in other cases\r\nconsiderable amplitude of description (see esp. v. 1-20, 35-43 and ix.\r\n14-27). But Mark's own writing might exhibit this variety, according to\r\nwhat he had been told or could remember. Moreover, a tendency to\r\namplitude of language may be noticed here and there in some of the more\r\nconcise narratives. Further, it would be unreasonable to suppose that\r\nMark, even if he relied chiefly on what he had heard Peter teach, would\r\nrefrain from using any other sources of information which he possessed.\r\nSome have supposed that the same Logian document in Greek which was used\r\nby the first and third evangelists was also used by Mark. This is highly\r\nimprobable, but he may have derived particular sayings from the Aramaic\r\nsource itself of that document by independent translation; and may also\r\nhave learned both sayings and narratives in other ways. It would seem\r\nalso that the Discourse on the Last Things in ch. xiii., differing as it\r\ndoes both in its greater length and in its systematic structure from\r\nother discourses recorded by him, must have come to his hands in a\r\nwritten form. In it some genuine sayings of Christ appear to have been\r\nworked up along with matter taken from Jewish Apocalypses and in\r\naccordance with an Apocalyptic model.\r\n\r\nThere does not, then, seem to be good reason for thinking that the work\r\nwhich proceeded from the hands of Mark differed widely in character and\r\ncontents from the Gospel which now bears his name. But there are\r\nindications that some passages have been interpolated in it: e.g. in\r\nMark iv. 10 there is some want of fitness in the inquiry of the\r\ndisciples as to the meaning of \"the parables\" after only one has been\r\ngiven, and again a want of agreement between that inquiry and the words\r\nof Jesus at _v._ 13, \"Know ye not _this_ parable, and how shall ye know\r\nall the parables?\" We notice further that the two parables in _vv._\r\n26-32 are somewhat loosely appended. It looks as if they were insertions\r\nin the passage as it originally stood, and that the references to\r\nparables in the plural, together with the statement at vv. 33, 34, had\r\nbeen introduced in order to adapt the context to these additions. This\r\nview is confirmed by the fact that in Luke viii. 4 seq. only one\r\nparable, that of the sower, is given or referred to. This evangelist has\r\nprobably here followed the original form of Mark. Similarly the\r\ncollection of sayings after Mark ix. 40 (vv. 41-50) has probably been\r\ninterpolated. They are thrown together in a way unusual with Mark, who\r\nis accustomed to place each important saying in a setting of its own.\r\nHere again we note that they do not appear at the corresponding point in\r\nLuke, though some of them are given by him in other contexts. The\r\naccount of the crossing of the lake (vi. 45-53) after the feeding of the\r\nfive thousand furnishes an instance of a different kind. The difficulty\r\nas to the position of Bethsaida, or (if [Greek: eis to peran], \"unto the\r\nother side,\" at v. 45 is taken to refer only to the crossing of a bay at\r\nthe north-eastern corner of the lake) the discrepancy between \"crossing\"\r\nin this sense and in that of v. 53 would be explained if the narrative\r\n(which is not in Luke) may be held to be an interpolation by one not\r\nfamiliar with the localities. Once more, the account of the feeding of\r\nthe four thousand (viii. 1-9) resembles that of the feeding of the five\r\nthousand (vi. 35-44) closely in all respects except that of the numbers\r\ngiven, about which differences might easily arise in tradition, and it\r\nlooks therefore as if it might be a \"doublet,\" i.e. another form of the\r\nsame narrative derived through a different channel. And it is not so\r\nlikely that Mark should have mistaken it for a distinct incident as that\r\nan editor of his Gospel should have done so. Some other instances, of\r\ngreater or less probability, might be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such larger insertions, the text of the original document\r\nseems to have undergone a certain amount of revision. Some of the cases\r\nin which the first and third evangelist agree against Mark in a word or\r\nclause may be best accounted for by their both having reproduced the\r\ncommon source (an example may be seen under 4 below).\r\n\r\nAs we have found it necessary to distinguish between the original\r\ncomposition by Mark, to whom in the main the work appears to be due, and\r\nsome enlargement and alteration which it subsequently underwent whereby\r\nit reached its present form, these stages must be borne in mind in\r\nconsidering dates that may be assigned in connexion with this Gospel.\r\nAccording to Papias, Mark wrote after the death of Peter, i.e. after\r\nA.D. 64, if we suppose, as it is usual to do, that Peter was martyred in\r\nthe massacre by Nero after the burning of Rome. It would be natural for\r\nMark to set himself to make his record soon after the Apostle's death;\r\nand in confirmation of the view that he did so it may be pointed out\r\nthat in the form of the prophecy in ch. xiii. of the calamities that\r\nwere to come upon Jerusalem, no details occur of a kind to suggest that\r\nit had actually taken place. Further, Mark's work may very probably have\r\nbeen used by Luke in its original form. On the other hand, it was known\r\nto our first evangelist very nearly in the form in which we have it. The\r\nchief revision of Mark would seem, then, to have taken place between the\r\ntimes of the composition of the first and third Gospels, which cannot be\r\nfar removed from one another (see MATTHEW, GOSPEL OF ST). The last\r\ntwelve verses were added later still, probably early in the 2nd century,\r\nprobably to take the place of the ending which had been lost, or which\r\nwas regarded as defective. (On the evidence that the last 12 verses are\r\nnot by the same hand as the rest of the Gospels see Westcott and Hort's\r\n_New Testament in Greek_, append., p. 29 seq. and Swete's _St Mark in\r\nloc._ and p. xcvi. seq. of his introduction.)\r\n\r\n  (3) _The Gospel History as represented in Mark._--After a (i)\r\n  prefatory passage, i. 1-13, the Gospel deals with (ii) _Christ's\r\n  ministry in Galilee and other parts of northern Palestine_, i. 14-ix.\r\n  50. This portion of the history may suitably be divided into three\r\n  periods: (a) _Early period._ From the opening of the work of Jesus to\r\n  the first plot to destroy Him (i. 14-iii. 6). (b) _Middle period._\r\n  From the gathering of crowds from all parts and appointment of the\r\n  Twelve to the sending forth of the Twelve to extend Christ's work and\r\n  the alarm of Herod (iii. 7-vi. 29). (c) _Closing period._ From\r\n  Christ's withdrawal with His disciples after their return from their\r\n  mission to His final departure from Galilee (vi. 30-ix. 50).\r\n  Throughout we can trace a development as to (a) the stir created and\r\n  the attitude of men towards Jesus: i. 32-34, 37 (excitement at\r\n  Capernaum); 38, 45 (fame spreads through a wide district); iii. 7, 8\r\n  (people from distant parts appear in the crowds); iv. 2 seq. (the word\r\n  of the Kingdom is received in very various ways); viii. 28 (great\r\n  diversity of opinions as to the claims of Jesus); (b) the opposition\r\n  to Him, ii. 1-iii. 6-iii. 22 (scribes come from Jerusalem and a more\r\n  heinous charge is preferred); (c) the formation of a band of disciples\r\n  and the position accorded to them: i. 16-20 (four are called to follow\r\n  Him); ii. 14 (yet another); iii. 14 (He \"makes twelve\" including those\r\n  before called); vi. 7 seq (He sends them out to preach and work\r\n  cures); (d) the methods which he adopts: i. 21, 39-iii. 1 (preaches in\r\n  the synagogues, later more commonly by the lake-shore or on the\r\n  mountain sides; or He teaches in a house where He happens to be); at\r\n  iv. 1 seq. he adopts a new mode of address because a sifting-process\r\n  was required; from vi. 45 onwards He mainly devotes Himself to the\r\n  training of the Twelve, while seeking retirement from the multitude;\r\n  (e) in the districts which he visits: i. 38 (tour in the neighbourhood\r\n  of Capernaum); v. 1 (crosses to eastern shore of the lake); vi. 6b (a\r\n  tour which includes Nazareth); vi. 45 (Bethsaida); vii. 31 (journey to\r\n  Tyre and Sidon and back through Decapolis); viii. 22, 27 (is at\r\n  Bethsaida and visits neighbourhood of Caesarea Philippi); (f) His\r\n  self-revelation; viii. 27 seq. (first unambiguous declaration of His\r\n  Messiahship).\r\n\r\n  (iii) _The Journey from Galilee to Jerusalem, the Last Days, Passion\r\n  and Resurrection_, x. 1 to end. He goes first to \"the borders of\r\n  Judaea and beyond Jordan\" (Peraea), and exercises His ministry there,\r\n  x. 1-16. In connexion with the journey from this region to Jerusalem\r\n  three striking incidents are recorded, x. 17-52. The account of the\r\n  time in Jerusalem includes a series of conflicts with opponents xi.\r\n  27-xii. 40, and the discourse on the Last Things, xiii. The only notes\r\n  of time in the Gospel occur in connexion with the conspiracy to kill\r\n  Jesus (xiv. 1) and the Last Supper (verse 12).\r\n\r\n(4) _The Leading Ideas of St Mark._--Ch. i. 1, which stands as a title,\r\nwas probably, even according to the short form of it which is supported\r\nby MS. evidence, due to a reviser of the original. Both Matthew and Luke\r\nshow signs of having had a somewhat different beginning before them.\r\nNevertheless, that title fitly describes the work. It is emphatically\r\n\"the Gospel,\" because it sets forth the person and work of the Christ.\r\nThe evangelist is conscious of this aim. It appears not only at great\r\nmoments of the history such as the Baptism (i. 11), the confession of\r\nPeter (viii. 29), the Transfiguration (ix. 7); nor again merely in the\r\nprominence given to the miracles of Jesus and in particular to the\r\ncasting out of devils, but also in many of the sayings recorded in it,\r\nas in the great series contained in the narratives in ch. ii. 5, 10, 17,\r\n19; and again in the reply of Jesus to those who charged Him with being\r\nin collusion with Satan (iii. 27). The character of the genuine\r\ndisciples of the Christ and the demands that are made of them form, as\r\nit were, the complement to the representation of what He Himself is, and\r\nare set forth in other striking sayings, related along with the\r\nmemorable occasions on which they were spoken: (iii. 34, 35; viii.\r\n34-36; ix. 23, 29, 35-37; x. 14, 15, 42-45).\r\n\r\n  See Swete, _Commentary on St Mark_ (2nd ed., 1902); A.

William Henry Markby, rector of Duxford St Peter's, was born at\r\nDuxford, Cambridge, in 1829. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds and\r\nMerton College, Oxford, where he took his degree in 1850. In 1856 he was\r\ncalled to the bar, and in 1865 he became recorder of Buckingham. In 1866\r\nhe went to India as judge of the High Court of Calcutta. This post he\r\nheld for twelve years, and on his retirement was appointed Reader in\r\nIndian Law at Oxford. In 1892 he was a member of the Commission to\r\ninquire into the administration of justice at Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nBesides _Lectures on Indian Law_, he wrote _Elements of Law considered\r\nwith reference to the General Principles of Jurisprudence_. The latter,\r\nbeing intended in the first place for Indian students, calls attention\r\nto many difficulties in the definition and application of legal\r\nconceptions which are usually passed over in textbooks, and it ranks as\r\none of the few books on the philosophy of law which are both useful to\r\nbeginners and profitable to teachers and thinkers. In 1897 appeared _The\r\nIndian Evidence Act, with Notes_. Sir William Markby also contributed\r\nto the law magazines, articles on _Law and Fact_, _German Jurists and\r\nRoman Law_, _Legal Fictions_, &c., several of which are embodied in the\r\nlater editions of the _Elements_. He was made D.C.L. of Oxford in 1879,\r\nand K.C.I.E. in 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET (Lat. _mercatus_, trade or place of trade). This term is used in\r\ntwo well-defined senses. (1) It means a definite place where (a) traders\r\nwho are retail sellers of a specific class of commodity or commodities\r\nare in the habit of awaiting buyers every day in shops or stalls; or\r\nwhither (b) they are in the habit of proceeding on specified days at\r\nmore or less frequent regular intervals. Covent Garden market for fruit\r\nand flowers, and Leadenhall market for meat and poultry, are good\r\nexamples in London of the kind of institution included in class (a).\r\nThey are a very ancient economic phenomenon, dating from the earliest\r\nperiod of the development of organized communities of human beings, and\r\nin general characteristics have changed little since they began to\r\nexist. Markets of the type of class (b) are also of very ancient origin\r\n(see FAIRS), but inasmuch as they are constituted essentially by the\r\npresence of persons, many of whom assemble from various places outside\r\nthe place of meeting, they were capable of a little more development\r\nthan those belonging to class (a), owing to increased facilities for\r\nlocomotion. The nature of an ancient market of class (a), whither a\r\ncitizen, say of Athens, or his chief slave, proceeded daily to make\r\nhousehold purchases, differs little from the group of shops visited by\r\nthe wives of the less wealthy citizens of modern states. In many places\r\nabroad, and not a few in England, actual markets still exist. It may be\r\nsaid that the huge collections of shops, such as the various cooperative\r\nstores, are only a revival of the old \"market-place,\" with its shops or\r\nbooths gathered round a central area, adapted to the needs of modern big\r\ncities. (2) The term \"market\" has come to be used in another and more\r\ngeneral sense in modern times. According to Jevons, a market is \"any\r\nbody of persons who are in intimate business relations, and carry on\r\nextensive transactions in any commodity.\" He adds that \"these markets\r\nmay or may not be localized,\" and he instances the money market as a\r\ncase in which the term \"market\" denotes no special locality. As a rule,\r\nhowever, most of the business of a market is transacted at some\r\nparticular place, such as the London Stock Exchange, the Baltic, the\r\nBourse of Paris, the Chicago \"Wheat-pit.\" Even in the case of the London\r\nmoney market, merchants still meet twice a week at the Royal Exchange to\r\ndeal in foreign bills, although a considerable part of the dealings in\r\nthese securities is arranged daily at offices and counting-houses by\r\npersonal visits or by telegraphic or telephonic communication. The\r\nmarkets in any important article are all closely interconnected. The\r\nsubmarine cable has long ago made Chicago as important an influence on\r\nthe London corn market as Liverpool, or rather both London and Liverpool\r\naffect and are simultaneously affected by Chicago and other foreign\r\nmarkets. In like manner the Liverpool cotton market is influenced by the\r\nmarkets in New Orleans and other American cities separated from it\r\nwidely in space. In a minor degree the dealers in all places where a\r\ncotton market exists affect the bigger markets to some extent. What is\r\ntrue of the cotton market is also true to some extent of all markets,\r\nthough few markets are so highly organized or show such large\r\ntransactions as that for cotton. Among other markets of the first class\r\nmay be mentioned those for pig-iron, wheat, copper, coffee, and sugar.\r\nThere are many articles the markets for which are of considerable\r\ndimensions at times, but are of an intermittent character, such as the\r\nLondon Wool Sales, which take place now in five \"series\" during the\r\nyear. Formerly the number of \"series\" was four. (For \"market overt,\" see\r\nSALE OF GOODS and STOLEN GOODS.)\r\n\r\n_Characteristics of Markets._--The conditions required in order that the\r\noperations of a trading body may display the fully-developed features of\r\na modern market, whether for commodities or securities, are:--\r\n\r\n(1) A large number of parties dealing.\r\n\r\n(2) A large amount of the commodities or securities to be dealt with.\r\n\r\n(3) An organization by which all persons interested in the commodity or\r\nsecurity can rapidly communicate with one another.\r\n\r\n(4) Existence and frequent publication of statistical and other\r\ninformation as to the present and probable future supply of the\r\ncommodity or security.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Movements of Prices.\r\n\r\nThe movements which take place in prices in any market, whether fully\r\norganized or not, depend largely on changes of opinion among buyers and\r\nsellers. The changes of opinion may be caused by erroneous as well as by\r\ncorrect information. They may also be the result of wrong inferences\r\ndrawn from correct information. In markets for commodities of the first\r\nimportance, such as wheat, cotton, iron, and other articles which are\r\ndealt in daily, the state of opinion may vary much during a few hours.\r\nThe broad characteristics of markets of this class are similar. There is\r\na tendency in all of them to show phenomena of annual periodicity, due\r\npartly to the seasons, the activity of certain months being in normal\r\nyears greater in the case of any given market than that of other months.\r\nThis tendency was always liable to be interfered with by the special\r\nforces at work in particular years; and the great increase in the\r\nfacilities of communication between dealers by telegraph, and of\r\ntransportation of commodities between widely distant points, which was\r\none of the marked features of the development of the economic organism\r\nin all actively commercial countries during the last thirty years of the\r\n19th century, has still further interfered with it. Nevertheless, a\r\ntendency to annual periodicity is still perceptible, especially in\r\nmarkets for produce of the soil, the supply of which largely depends on\r\nthe meteorological conditions of the areas where they are grown on a\r\nscale sufficient to furnish an appreciable proportion of the total\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cycles.\r\n\r\nPeriodicity of another kind known as \"cyclic,\" and due to a different\r\nset of causes, is believed to exist by many persons competent to form a\r\njudgment; but although the evidence for this view is very strong, the\r\ntheory expounding it is not yet in a sufficiently advanced state to\r\nadmit of its being regarded as established.\r\n\r\n_Phenomena of Markets._--Bagehot said of the money market that it is\r\n\"often very dull and sometimes extremely excited.\" This classical\r\ndescription of the market for \"money\" applies to a large extent to all\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tendency to Equilibrium.\r\n\r\nEvery market is at every moment tending to an equilibrium between the\r\nquantity of commodities offered and that of commodities desired;\r\nsupposing equilibrium to have been attained in a given market, and that\r\nfor some appreciable period it is not disturbed, the price for the\r\ncommodity dealt in, in the market, will remain practically unchanged\r\nduring that period. Not that there will be no transactions going on, but\r\nthat the amounts offered daily will be approximately equal to the\r\namounts demanded daily.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Disturbance of Equilibrium.\r\n\r\nWe have briefly described the statical condition of a market; we must\r\nnow briefly examine its dynamics. Disturbance may take place through a\r\nchange in--\r\n\r\n(1) Supply, or opinion as to future probable supply.\r\n\r\n(2) Demand, or opinion as to future probable demand.\r\n\r\n(3) In both simultaneously, but such a change that demand is increased\r\nor decreased more than the supply, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nA moderate disturbance caused by one of the above changes, or a\r\ncombination of them, will produce an immediate effect on the price of\r\nthe commodity, which again will tend to react on both the supply and the\r\ndemand by altering the opinions of sellers and buyers. If no further\r\nchange tending to disturb the market takes place, the market will\r\ngradually settle down again to a state of equilibrium. But if the\r\ndisturbance has been considerable, a relatively long time may elapse\r\nbefore the market becomes quiet; and very likely the level of price at\r\nwhich the new equilibrium is established will be very different from\r\nthat ruling before the disturbance set in. Further scientific\r\ninvestigation of the dynamics of a market is in any case very\r\ndifficult, and is impossible without a complete analysis of the statical\r\ncondition, such as is found at length in the textbooks of mathematical\r\neconomics; but it is possible to describe briefly certain dynamical\r\nphenomena of markets which are of a comparatively simple character, and\r\nare also of practical interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Future Delivery.\r\n\r\nEvery great market is organized with a view not merely to the purchase\r\nand sale of a commodity at once, or \"on the spot,\" but also with a view\r\nto the future requirements of buyers and sellers. This organization\r\narises naturally from the necessities of business, since modern industry\r\nand commerce are carried on continuously, and provision has to be made\r\nfor the requirements, say, of a spinning-mill, by arranging for the\r\ndelivery of successive quantities of cotton, wool or silk over a period\r\nof months \"ahead.\" In the case of cotton, \"forward deliveries\" can be\r\npurchased six or seven months in advance, and the person who undertakes\r\nto deliver the cotton at the times stated is said in the language of the\r\nmarket to \"sell forward.\" If the quantity of cotton produced each year\r\nwere always the same, no very remarkable results would follow from this\r\nmode of doing business, except the economy resulting to the spinner from\r\nnot being compelled to lock up part of his capital in raw material\r\nbefore he could use it. But as the cotton and other crops vary\r\nconsiderably from year to year, some curious consequences follow from\r\nthe practice of \"selling forward.\" The seller, of course, makes his\r\nbargain in the belief that he will be able to \"cover\" the sale he has\r\nmade at a profit--that is, he hopes to be able to buy the cotton he has\r\nto deliver at a lower price than he undertook to deliver it at. If so,\r\nall is well for both parties, for the buyer has had the advantage of\r\nhaving insured a supply of cotton. But supposing something has happened\r\nto raise the price considerably, such as a great \"shortage\" of the crop,\r\nthe seller may lose. If a great many other persons have taken the same\r\nmistaken view of the probabilities of the market, a condition of things\r\nmay arise in which they may be \"cornered.\" (See COTTON.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Corners.\"\r\n\r\nA \"corner\" in an exchangeable article is an abnormal condition of the\r\nmarket for it, in which, owing to a serious miscalculation of probable\r\nsupply, many traders who have made contracts to deliver at a certain\r\ndate are unable to fulfil them. In most cases the fact that the market\r\nis \"oversold\" becomes known some time before the date for the completion\r\nof the contracts, and other traders take advantage of the position to\r\nraise the price against those who are \"short\" of the article. A corner\r\nis therefore usually a result of the failure of a speculation for the\r\nfall. Theoretically a trader who has undertaken to deliver 100 tons of\r\nan article, but cannot, after every endeavour, obtain more than 90 tons,\r\ncould be made to pay his whole capital in order to be relieved from the\r\nbargain. In practice he gets off more easily than this. Frequently when\r\nmany traders have sold largely \"forward\" other traders deliberately try\r\nto use that position as a basis for creating a \"corner.\" Generally,\r\nhowever, they only succeed in causing great inconvenience to all\r\nparties, themselves included, for as a rule they are only able to make\r\nthe \"corner\" effective by buying up so much of the article that when\r\nthey have compelled their opponents to pay largely to be relieved of\r\ncontracts to deliver, they are left with so big a stock of the article\r\nthat they cannot sell it except at a loss, which is sometimes big enough\r\nto absorb the gain previously secured. In the case of very small markets\r\n\"corners\" may be complete, but in big markets they are never complete,\r\nsomething always happening to prevent the full realization of the\r\noperators' plans. The idea of a \"corner\" is, however, so fascinating to\r\nthe commercial mind, especially in the United States, that probably no\r\nyear passes without an attempt at some operation of the kind, though the\r\nconditions may in most cases prevent any serious result.\r\n\r\n\"Corners\" have what is called a \"moral\" aspect. It is curious to note\r\nthat the indignation of the \"market\" at the disturbance to prices which\r\nresults from operations of this kind is generally directed against the\r\nspeculators for the fall, while that of the public, including trade\r\nconsumers, is directed against the operator for the rise. The operator\r\nfor the fall, or \"bear,\" is denounced for \"selling what he has not got,\"\r\na very inaccurate description of his action, while the \"bull\" or\r\noperator for the rise is spoken of by a much wider circle as a heartless\r\nperson who endeavours to make a profit out of the necessities of others.\r\nFrom a strict ethical standpoint there is really nothing to choose\r\nbetween the two.\r\n\r\n_The Money Market._--There is one market which presents features of so\r\npeculiar a character that it is necessary to describe it more\r\nparticularly than other phenomena of the kind, and that is the money\r\nmarket. The term money is here used to denote \"money-market money\" or\r\n\"bankers' money,\" a form of wealth which has existed from early times,\r\nbut not in great abundance until within the last two or three hundred\r\nyears. Immense wealth has existed in certain countries at various\r\nepochs, owing to the fertility of the soil, success in trade, or the\r\nplunder of other communities, and all states which have been great have\r\nat the time of their greatness possessed wealth; but the wealth which\r\nthe countries, or a few fortunate individuals belonging to them, owned\r\nconsisted largely of what is still called real property--that is, land\r\nand buildings--and of the produce of the soil or of mines. The balance\r\nconsisted partly of merchandise of various kinds and shipping, and to a\r\nlarge extent of the precious metals in the form of coin or bullion, or\r\nof precious stones and jewelry. Where no settled government was\r\nestablished no one could become or remain very wealthy who was not in a\r\nposition to defend himself by the strong hand or allied with those who\r\nwere; and as a rule the only people who could so defend themselves were\r\npossessors of large areas of rich land, who were able to retain the\r\nservices of those who dwelt on it either through their personal military\r\nqualities or in virtue of habit and custom. The inhabitants of wealthy\r\ncities were able to protect themselves to some extent, but they nearly\r\nalways found it necessary to ally themselves with the neighbouring\r\nland-owners, whom they aided with money in return for military support.\r\n\r\nA money market in the modern sense of the word could only exist in a\r\nrudimentary form under these conditions. There was a sort of money\r\nmarket, for there was a changing rate of interest and a whole code of\r\nlaw relating to it (Macleod, _Banking_, 3rd ed., p. 174) in republican\r\nRome; but although large lending and borrowing transactions were part of\r\nthe daily life of the Roman business world, as well as of those of the\r\nGreek cities and of Carthage and its dependencies, none of these\r\ncommunities presented the phenomena of a highly organised market.\r\nMoney-lending was also a regular practice in Egypt, Chaldea and other\r\nancient seats of civilization, as recent discoveries show. It was only\r\nin comparatively recent times, however, when Europe had formed itself\r\ninto more or less organized states, with conditions fairly favourable to\r\nthe steady growth of trade and industry, that organized money markets\r\ncame into existence in places such as Venice, Genoa, Augsburg, Basel,\r\nthe Hanse towns, and various cities in the Low Countries, Spain and\r\nPortugal, as well as in London. The financial strength of these\r\nrudimentary money markets was not very great, and as it depended a good\r\ndeal on the possession by individuals of actual cash, the existence of\r\nthese markets was precarious. \"Hoarded ducats\" were too often an\r\nattraction to needy princes, whose unwelcome attentions a rich merchant,\r\neven when an influential burgher of a powerful city, was less able to\r\nresist than the violence of a housebreaker, against whom strong vaults\r\nand well-secured chests situated in defensible mansions were a good\r\nprotection. The necessitous potentate could often urge his desire for a\r\n\"loan\" by very persuasive methods. Occasionally, if his predecessors had\r\nacquired the confidence of the banking class sufficiently to induce them\r\nto place their cash reserves in one of his strong places \"for safety\" an\r\nunscrupulous ruler could help himself, as Charles II. helped himself to\r\nthe stores of the London goldsmiths which were left in the Mint. The\r\npower of the banking class continued to grow, however, and a real market\r\nfor money had come into existence in many cities of Europe by the\r\nmiddle of the 17th century. (See BANKS AND BANKING.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Early Money Market.\r\n\r\nIn the 18th century the \"money market\" consisted of the Bank of England\r\nand various banks and merchants, and distinction between the two being\r\nstill not complete. Towards the end of that century arose an important\r\nclass of dealers in credit, the bill brokers, and with their appearance\r\nthe modern money market of London may be said to have assumed its\r\npresent form, for though the process of development has not ceased, the\r\nchanges have been of the nature of growth and not of the acquisition of\r\nnew organs. The formation of joint-stock banks and discount companies,\r\nhowever, and the reconstitution of the Bank of England by the Act of\r\n1844, exercised an important influence on the way in which the money\r\nmarket of London has developed. It must be explained that in the\r\nevery-day talk of the City \"the market\" has a special meaning, by which\r\nonly the banks and discount houses, or even only the latter in some\r\ncases, are denoted, as in the phrases constantly seen in the daily\r\nreports published in the newspapers towards the end of a quarter, \"the\r\nmarket has to-day borrowed largely from the Bank of England,\" or, \"the\r\nmarket was obliged to renew part of the loans which fell due to the Bank\r\nto-day.\" But this use of the term in a special sense, thoroughly\r\nunderstood by those to whom it is habitual, and resulting in no\r\nambiguity in practice, is not in accord with the requirements of\r\neconomic analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Modern Money Market of London.\r\n\r\nThe working organs of the money market of London at the beginning of the\r\n20th century were:--\r\n\r\n  A. (1) The Bank of England.\r\n     (2) Banks, joint-stock and private, including several great foreign\r\n           banks.\r\n     (3) Discount houses and bill-brokers.\r\n\r\n  B. (4) Certain members of the Stock Exchange.\r\n     (5) Certain great merchants and finance houses.\r\n\r\nThe institutions included in group A are the most constantly active\r\norgans of the money market; those included in group B are intermittently\r\nactive, but in the case of section (4), though their activity is greater\r\nat some times than others, they are never wholly outside the market.\r\nEven in the case of (5) a certain amount of qualification is needed,\r\nwhich is indicated by the fact that most of the great merchant houses\r\nare \"registered\" as bankers, though they do not perform the functions\r\nusually associated with that term in the United Kingdom. Several of the\r\ngreat houses were originally and still are nominally merchants, but are\r\nlargely concerned with finance business--that is, with the making of\r\nloans to foreign governments and the issue of capital on behalf of\r\ncompanies. These powerful capitalists often have large amounts of money\r\ntemporarily in their hands, and lend it in the money market or on the\r\nStock Exchange; one or two of them are large buyers of bills from time\r\nto time, and generally the members of this group may be said to be in\r\nsufficiently close touch with the active organs of the money market to\r\nform part of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Working of the Money Market.\r\n\r\nThe actual working of the money market has been described by Walter\r\nBagehot in his _Lombard Street_, a work which has attained the rank of a\r\nclassic. Most of what he said in 1873 is true now, but in certain minor\r\nrespects developments have taken place, the most important being the\r\ngreater extent to which money is \"used up\" every day, or rather every\r\nnight. In Bagehot's time the discount houses only quoted \"allowance\"\r\nrates for \"loans at call and short notice,\" based on the rate \"allowed\"\r\nby the banks for loans at seven days' notice; but since then the\r\nbill-brokers have been obliged--(1) occasionally to fix their terms\r\nindependently of the banks, and (2) to \"allow\" a rate for \"money for the\r\nnight.\" This latter practice became usual about 1888 or 1889. The change\r\nit introduced was not a vital one, but has some importance from the\r\npoint of view of the historian. A good deal of the \"money\" thus dealt\r\nwith is derived from the group of traders included in class (5). It is\r\n(a) money which is temporarily in the hands of houses or institutions\r\nwhich have just received subscriptions to loans or other capital offered\r\nto the public; (b) balances left temporarily with finance houses or\r\nbanks on behalf of foreign governments or other parties who have\r\npayments to make in London. In the former case the \"money\" is almost\r\ninvariably only available for a short time, probably only for a few\r\ndays; in the latter case also it probably will be only available for a\r\nfew days, but _may_ be available for months. Money derived from either\r\nof these sources is usually to be had cheap, but is not, in the slang of\r\nthe City, \"good,\" because it is uncertain how long loans at call\r\nobtained from either of them will remain undisturbed. Nevertheless,\r\nthere has been at times so much \"money\" of this fugitive character, and\r\nderived from such varied sources since about 1888, that its cheapness\r\nhas been an attraction to the less wealthy bill-brokers, who have\r\noccasionally been able to go on using it profitably for many continuous\r\nweeks, or even months, in their business. The risk run by employing it\r\nis, of course, the certainty that it will be \"called\" from the borrower\r\nsooner or later, and probably at a time when it is very inconvenient to\r\nrepay it. The more wealthy houses take money of this kind when it suits\r\nthem, but never rely on it as a basis for business.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Great Banks.\r\n\r\nSince Bagehot wrote the growth of the big joint-stock banks has been\r\nenormous, not so much through the increased business done by banks\r\ngenerally, though the expansion in banking has been considerable, as by\r\nthe absorption of a great number of small banks by three or four large\r\ninstitutions (see BANKS AND BANKING). The growth of these large\r\ninstitutions tends to facilitate combination for purposes of common\r\nconcern among banks generally--e.g. to support the Bank of England in\r\nmaintaining its reserve, which is the sole reserve of all the banks, at\r\na proper level, and thus render the money market more stable. Two or\r\nthree of the banks have for a long time, owing to their large holding of\r\nbills, had much more influence than the Bank of England over the foreign\r\nexchanges, on which the foreign bullion movements chiefly depend; and\r\nsince 1890 persons of weight in the joint-stock banking body have\r\nimplicitly, though not explicitly, admitted a certain degree of\r\nresponsibility in the matter on behalf of their institutions. It is,\r\nhowever, characteristic of British business arrangements that the\r\nquestion of the responsibility for the reserve of the Bank of England,\r\nthe ultimate reserve of the whole country, is still in as nebulous a\r\ncondition, so far as explicit acceptance of responsibility by any\r\ninstitution is concerned, as it was in 1870. There has been no\r\nimprovement in theory, though in practice there has been real\r\nimprovement, since Bagehot's time. The tendency is, indeed, decidedly in\r\nthe direction of closer combination between the Bank and the banks. On\r\nmore than one occasion the Bank has, not merely by borrowing \"in the\r\nmarket,\" but by more or less private negotiations with the big banks,\r\nobtained temporary control of large sums belonging to the banks in order\r\nto take cash off the market. This proceeding, and its concomitants, did\r\nnot meet with universal approval; but the results were satisfactory on\r\nthe whole, and on the later occasions when the measure was carried out\r\nthere was little or no friction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Effect of Big Foreign Loans.\r\n\r\nThe enormous war loans raised by Japan in 1904, 1905, 1906 exemplified\r\naptly the more modern methods of dealing with the disturbance to the\r\nmoney market which such operations produce. The loans were issued by\r\nthree banks, one of which was a Japanese institution and represented the\r\nJapanese government in the operations connected with the various loans.\r\nOf the other two, one was a leading London bank and the other the\r\nprincipal British bank doing business in China. These large loans were\r\nissued with the minimum of disturbance to the London money market. The\r\nvery large amounts of cash which were suddenly withdrawn from other\r\nbanks, and deposited with the institutions issuing the loan as\r\n\"application money,\" were lent out again in the short loan market as\r\nsoon as possible, usually on the afternoon of the day of issue. The work\r\ninvolved was very heavy, as a great number of cheques had to be cleared\r\nin a brief space of time, but by skilful organization this was done.\r\nSimilar promptitude was displayed when the successive instalments on the\r\nloans became due and were paid, most of the cash being available for\r\nborrowers a few hours after it was paid in by the holders of the scrip\r\nwhich represented the loans until the definitive bonds were ready. The\r\ntask of dealing with cash forming instalments of the loans was not,\r\nhowever, the only problem before the banks which issued them. As the\r\nscrip of each loan gradually became \"fully paid\" the proceeds of the\r\nloan in the hands of the banks became a very large sum. The Japanese\r\ngovernment held the whole of it at its disposal, and might have\r\nseriously embarrassed the London money market if it had not dealt with\r\nits huge balances considerately. The Japanese government had promised\r\nnot to withdraw any portion of the loans raised in London in gold, but\r\nit was under no restrictions as to how it should employ the money lying\r\nto its account. It might have kept it locked up until it had a bill for\r\nships or clothing to pay. As might be expected, the government from the\r\noutset transferred a portion of what was deposited with the banks to the\r\nBank of England, finding it advantageous on various grounds to do so.\r\nThe remainder was lent for short periods by the banks, but for some time\r\nno means were available for lending for any considerable length of time,\r\nthough the Japanese government had no immediate use for the whole of it.\r\nIt was suggested to the government by its advisers that it would be a\r\nconvenience to the money market, and no inconvenience to Japanese\r\npolicy, if any balances which were not likely to be wanted for some\r\nmonths were invested in British treasury bills, and the government,\r\nafter fully acquainting itself with the nature of the operation, agreed\r\nto it. The plan was found to work well; it released for definite periods\r\nmoney that would otherwise have been of little use to the money market,\r\nand it was of pecuniary benefit to the Japanese exchequer to the extent\r\nof the interest earned by the portion of the balances so employed.\r\nIncidentally it suited the British treasury; the Japanese demand, which\r\nbecame a constant feature in connexion with treasury bill issues,\r\nlowered the discount rates at which \"sixes\" were placed. The Japanese\r\nnot only applied for treasury bills and bought them in the market, but\r\nthey also took up some of the exchequer bonds issued in connexion with\r\nthe South African war towards the end of their currency, thus relieving\r\nthe money market of a further part of the weight of British government\r\npaper which it would otherwise have had to take on itself. A further\r\nimportant development of Japanese management of its London balances took\r\nplace in 1906, when a portion of these balances was placed under the\r\ncontrol of agents of the Bank of England, to be lent, or not lent, in\r\nthe market as suited the Bank's policy, which was at that time directed\r\nto raising the value of money in order to protect and increase its\r\nreserve. The plan worked very well on the whole. It was merely an\r\nadaptation of a practice initiated some years before, whereby the Bank\r\nsometimes obtained temporary control of moneys belonging to the India\r\nCouncil. The same idea, that of \"intercepting\" market funds, which were\r\nbeating down the discount rate, depressing the foreign exchanges and\r\ndepleting the Bank's reserve, has been employed in regard to the\r\nclearing banks themselves, the banks having on more than one occasion\r\nagreed to lend the Bank of England a certain portion of their balances.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Discount Houses.\r\n\r\nThe discount houses, though an important body of institutions, are not\r\nof so much importance as they were before 1866, when they suffered a\r\nserious blow through the failure of \"Overend's,\" from which as a body\r\nthey have never fully recovered. The five large concerns which still\r\nexist are, however, very powerful and exercise considerable influence on\r\nthe market. They hold considerable quantities of bills at all times;\r\noccasionally their holdings are very large, but they turn out the\r\ncontents of their bill cases readily if they think fit. Their business\r\nis different in practice from that of the smaller \"bill-brokers,\" who\r\nusually are what their name suggests, namely, persons who do not hold\r\nmany bills, but find them for banks who need them, charging a small\r\ncommission. The small bill-brokers borrow from the Bank of England much\r\nmore freely than the big discount houses. The latter only \"go to the\r\nbank\" in ordinary times perhaps once or twice a year. During the South\r\nAfrican War, which disturbed the money market very much, they obtained\r\naccommodation from the Bank more frequently than usual. The small\r\nbrokers almost always have to borrow from the Bank at the end of every\r\nquarter, when money is scarce owing to the regular quarterly\r\nrequirements of business, and also, to some extent, because certain of\r\nthe banks make it a practice to call in loans at the end of each month\r\nin order to show a satisfactory cash reserve in their monthly\r\nbalance-sheet. This practice is not approved by the best authorities,\r\nfor although it does no great harm in quiet times, the banks who follow\r\nit might find it difficult, or even impossible, to call in their loans\r\nin times of severe stringency.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Walter Bagehot, _Lombard Street_ (1873); Arthur Ellis,\r\n  _Rationale of Market Fluctuations_; Robert Giffen, _Stock Exchange\r\n  Securities_ (1879); W.

N.N.W. from London on a branch from\r\nNuneaton of the London & North Western and Midland railways, near the\r\nAshby-de-la-Zouch canal. Pop. (1901), 659. The church of St Peter is\r\nPerpendicular, with a lofty tower and spire. At the grammar school,\r\nfounded in 1528, Dr Samuel Johnson was a master about 1732, but found\r\nthe work unbearable. The trade of Market Bosworth is principally\r\nagricultural, and there are brickworks. Two miles south is the scene of\r\nthe battle of Bosworth, in 1485, where Richard III. fell before Henry\r\nearl of Richmond, who thereupon assumed the crown as Henry VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET DRAYTON, a market town in the Newport division of Shropshire,\r\nEngland, on the river Tern and the Shropshire Union canal, 178 m. N.W.\r\nfrom London. Pop. (civil parish of Drayton-in-Hales, 1901), 5167. The\r\nWellington-Crewe line of the Great Western railway is here joined by a\r\nbranch into Staffordshire of the North Staffordshire railway. The church\r\nof St Mary has Norman remains but is modernised by restoration. The town\r\nis a centre of agricultural trade, and there are large iron foundries.\r\nIt is in the parish of Drayton-in-Hales, a name sometimes applied to it;\r\nand it is also known as Drayton Magna. It is an ancient town, of which\r\nthe manor was held successively by the abbots of St Ebrulph in Normandy\r\nand Combermere in Cheshire. On Blore Heath, 3 m. east in Staffordshire,\r\nAudley Cross marks a great battle in the Wars of the Roses (1459), in\r\nwhich the Yorkists were successful and Lord Audley fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKET HARBOROUGH, a market town in the Harborough parliamentary\r\ndivision of Leicestershire, England; on the river Welland and the Grand\r\nUnion Canal. Pop. of urban district (1901), 7735. It is 81 m. N.N.W.\r\nfrom London by the Midland railway, and is served by branches of the\r\nLondon & North Western and Great Northern railways. The church of St\r\nDionysius is Decorated and Perpendicular, with a fine tower and spire.\r\nThe grammar school was founded in 1614; it occupies modern buildings,\r\nbut the original house remains, a picturesque half-timbered building,\r\nraised upon pillars of wood. Both British and Roman remains have been\r\nfound in the vicinity. There are malt-houses and boot, shoe and stay\r\nfactories. The town is also an important fox-hunting centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKHAM, SIR CLEMENTS ROBERT (1830-   ), English traveller, geographer\r\nand author, son of the Rev. David F. Markham, canon of Windsor, and of\r\nCatherine, daughter of Sir W. Milner, Bart., of Nunappleton, Yorkshire,\r\nwas born on the 20th of July 1830 at Stillingfleet, near York, and\r\neducated at Westminster School. He entered the navy in 1844, became\r\nmidshipman in 1846, and passed for a lieutenant in 1851. In 1850-1851 he\r\nserved on the Franklin search expedition in the Arctic regions, under\r\nCaptain Austin. He retired from the navy in 1852, and in 1852-1854\r\ntravelled in Peru and the forests of the eastern Andes. He visited South\r\nAmerica again in 1860-1861, in order to arrange for the introduction of\r\nthe cinchona plant into India, a service of the highest value to\r\nhumanity. In 1865-1866 he visited Ceylon and India, to inspect and\r\nreport upon the Tinnevelly pearl-fishery and the cinchona plantations.\r\nOn the Abyssinian expedition of 1867-68 he served as geographer, and was\r\npresent at the storming of Magdala. In 1874 he accompanied the Arctic\r\nexpedition under Sir George Nares as far as Greenland. In later years\r\nSir Clements Markham travelled extensively in western Asia and the\r\nUnited States. In 1855 he became a clerk in the Board of Control. From\r\n1867-1877 he was in charge of the geographical department of the Indian\r\nOffice. He was secretary to the Hakluyt Society from 1858-1887, and\r\nbecame its president in 1890. From 1863-1888 he acted as secretary to\r\nthe Royal Geographical Society, and on his retirement received the\r\nsociety's gold medal for his distinguished services to geography. He was\r\nelected president of the same society in 1893, and retained office for\r\nthe unprecedented period of twelve years, taking an active share in the\r\nwork of the society and in increasing its usefulness in various\r\ndirections. It was almost entirely due to his exertions that funds were\r\nobtained for the National Antarctic Expedition under Captain Robert\r\nScott, which left England in the summer of 1901. Sir Clements Markham\r\nwas elected F.R.S. in 1873; was created C.B. in 1871, and K.C.B. in\r\n1896; became an honorary member of the principal geographical societies;\r\nand was president of the International Geographical Congress which met\r\nin London in 1895.\r\n\r\n  Sir Clements Markham conducted the _Geographical Magazine_ from\r\n  1872-1878, when it became merged in the _Proceedings of the Royal\r\n  Geographical Society_. Among his other publications may be mentioned\r\n  the following: _Franklin's Footsteps_ (1852); _Cuzco and Lima_ (1856);\r\n  _Travels in Peru and India_ (1862); _A Quichua Grammar and Dictionary_\r\n  (1863); _Spanish Irrigation_ (1867); _A History of the Abyssinian\r\n  Expedition_ (1869); _A Life of the Great Lord Fairfax_ (1870);\r\n  _Ollanta, a Quichua Drama_ (1871); _Memoir on the Indian Surveys_\r\n  (1871; 2nd ed., 1878); _General Sketch of the History of Persia_\r\n  (1873); _The Threshold of the Unknown Region_ (1874, 4 editions); _A\r\n  Memoir of the Countess of Chinchon_, (1875); _Missions to Thibet_,\r\n  (1877; 2nd ed., 1879); _Memoir of the Indian Surveys_; _Peruvian Bark_\r\n  (1880); _Peru_ (1880); _The War between Chili and Peru_ (1879-81; 3rd\r\n  ed., 1883); _The Sea Fathers_ (1885); _The Fighting Veres_ (1888);\r\n  _Paladins of King Edwin_ (1896); _Life of John Davis the Navigator_\r\n  (1889); a _Life of Richard III._ (1906), in which he maintained that\r\n  the king was not guilty of the murder of the two princes in the Tower;\r\n  also lives of _Admiral Fairfax_, _Admiral John Markham_, _Columbus_\r\n  and _Major Rennel_; _A History of Peru_; editions with introductions\r\n  of twenty works for the Hakluyt Society, of which fourteen were also\r\n  translations; about seventy papers in the Royal Geographical Society's\r\n  _Journal_; the _Reports on the Moral and Material Progress of India_\r\n  for 1871-1872 and 1872-1873; _Memoir of Sir John Harington_ for the\r\n  Roxburghe Club (1880); the Peruvian chapters for J. Winsor's _History\r\n  of America_, and the chapters on discovery and surveying for Clowes's\r\n  _History of the Navy_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKHAM, GERVASE (or JERVIS) (1568?-1637), English poet and\r\nmiscellaneous writer, third son of Sir Robert Markham of Cotham,\r\nNottinghamshire, was born probably in 1568. He was a soldier of fortune\r\nin the Low Countries, and later was a captain under the earl of Essex's\r\ncommand in Ireland. He was acquainted with Latin and several modern\r\nlanguages, and had an exhaustive practical acquaintance with the arts of\r\nforestry and agriculture. He was a noted horse-breeder, and is said to\r\nhave imported the first Arab. Very little is known of the events of his\r\nlife. The story of the murderous quarrel between Gervase Markham and Sir\r\nJohn Holles related in the _Biographia Britannica_ (s.v. Holles) has\r\nbeen generally connected with him, but in the _Dictionary of National\r\nBiography_, Sir Clements R. Markham, a descendant from the same family,\r\nrefers it to another contemporary of the same name, whose monument is\r\nstill to be seen in Laneham church. Gervase Markham was buried at St\r\nGiles's, Cripplegate, London, on the 3rd of February 1637. He was a\r\nvoluminous writer on many subjects, but he repeated himself considerably\r\nin his works, sometimes reprinting the same books under other titles.\r\nHis booksellers procured a declaration from him in 1617 that he would\r\nproduce no more on certain topics.\r\n\r\n  Markham's writings include: _The Teares of the Beloved_ (1600) and\r\n  _Marie Magdalene's Teares_ (1601) long and rather commonplace poems on\r\n  the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, both reprinted by Dr A. B.\r\n  Grosart in the _Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library_ (1871);\r\n  _The most Honorable Tragedy of Sir Richard Grinvile_ (1595), reprinted\r\n  (1871) by Professor E. Arber, a prolix and euphuistic poem in\r\n  eight-lined stanzas which was no doubt in Tennyson's mind when he\r\n  wrote his stirring ballad; _The Poem of Poems, or Syon's Muse_ (1595),\r\n  dedicated to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Sidney; _Devoreux,\r\n  Vertues Teares_ (1597). _Herod and Antipater, a Tragedy_ (1622) was\r\n  written in conjunction with William Sampson, and with Henry Machin he\r\n  wrote a comedy called _The Dumbe Knight_ (1608). _A Discourse of\r\n  Horsemanshippe_ (1593) was followed by other popular treatises on\r\n  horsemanship and farriery. _Honour in his Perfection_ (1624) is in\r\n  praise of the earls of Oxford, Southampton and Essex, and the\r\n  _Souldier's Accidence_ (1625) turns his military experiences to\r\n  account. He edited Juliana Berners's _Boke of Saint Albans_ under the\r\n  title of _The Gentleman's Academie_ (1595), and produced numerous\r\n  books on husbandry, many of which are catalogued in Lowndes's\r\n  _Bibliographer's Manual_ (Bohn's ed., 1857-1864).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKHAM, MRS, the pseudonym of Elizabeth Penrose (1780-1837), English\r\nwriter, daughter of Edmund Cartwright, the inventor of the power-loom.\r\nShe was born at her father's rectory at Goadby Marwood, Leicestershire,\r\non the 3rd of August 1780. In 1804 she married the Rev. John Penrose, a\r\ncountry clergyman in Lincolnshire and a voluminous theological writer.\r\nDuring her girlhood Mrs Penrose had frequently stayed with relatives at\r\nMarkham, a village in Nottinghamshire, and from this place she took the\r\n_nom de plume_ of \"Mrs Markham,\" under which she gained celebrity as a\r\nwriter of history and other books for the young. The best known of her\r\nbooks was _A History of England from the First Invasion by the Romans to\r\nthe End of the Reign of George III._ (1823), which went through numerous\r\neditions. In 1828 she published a _History of France_. Both these works\r\nenjoyed a wide popularity in America as well as in England. The\r\ndistinctive characteristic of \"Mrs Markham's\" histories was the\r\nelimination of all the \"horrors\" of history, and of the complications of\r\nmodern party politics, as being unsuitable for the youthful mind; and\r\nthe addition to each chapter of \"Conversations\" between a fictitious\r\ngroup consisting of teacher and pupils bearing upon the subject matter.\r\nHer less well-known works were _Amusements of Westernheath, or Moral\r\nStories for Children_ (2 vols., 1824); _A Visit to the Zoological\r\nGardens_ (1829); two volumes of stories entitled _The New Children's\r\nFriend_ (1832); _Historical Conversations for Young People_ (1836);\r\n_Sermons for Children_ (1837). Mrs Markham died at Lincoln on the 24th\r\nof January 1837.\r\n\r\n  See Samuel Smiles, _A Publisher and his Friends_ (2 vols., London,\r\n  1891); G. C. Boase and W. P. Courtney, _Bibliotheca Cornubiensis_ (3\r\n  vols., London, 1874-1882).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKHAM, WILLIAM (1719-1807), archbishop of York, was educated at\r\nWestminster and at Christ Church, Oxford. He was one of the best\r\nscholars of his day, and attained to the headship of his old school and\r\ncollege in 1753 and 1767 respectively. He held from time to time a\r\nnumber of livings, and in 1771 was made bishop of Chester and tutor to\r\nGeorge prince of Wales. In 1777 he became archbishop of York, and also\r\nlord high almoner and privy councillor. He was for some time a close\r\nfriend of Edmund Burke, but his strong championship of Warren Hastings\r\ncaused a breach. He was accused by Lord Chatham of preaching pernicious\r\ndoctrines, and was a victim of the Gordon riots in 1780. He died in\r\n1807.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKHOR (\"snake-eater\"), the Pushtu name of a large Himalayan wild goat\r\n(_Capra falconeri_), characterized by its spirally twisted horns, and\r\nlong shaggy winter coat. From the Pir-Panjal range of Kashmir the\r\nmarkhor extends westwards into Baltistan, Astor, Hunza, Afghanistan and\r\nthe trans-Indus ranges of the Punjab. The twist of the horns varies to a\r\ngreat extent locally, the spiral being most open and corkscrew-like in\r\nthe typical Astor animal, and closest and most screw-like in the race\r\n(_C. falconeri jerdoni_) inhabiting the Suleiman and adjacent ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKIRCH (French, _Ste-Marie-aux-Mines_), a town of Germany, in Upper\r\nAlsace, prettily situated in the valley of the Leber, an affluent of the\r\nRhine, near the French frontier. Pop. (1900), 12,372. The once\r\nproductive silver, copper and lead mines of the neighbourhood were\r\npractically unworked during the whole of the 19th century, but have\r\nrecently been reopened. The main industries of the place are, however,\r\nweaving and dyeing, and it is estimated that there are about 40,000\r\nwork-people in the industrial district of which Markirch is the centre.\r\nThe small river Leber, which intersects the town, was at one time the\r\nboundary between the German and French languages, and traces of this\r\nseparation still exist. The German-speaking inhabitants on the right\r\nbank were Protestants, and subject to the counts of Rappoltstein, while\r\nthe French inhabitants were Roman Catholics, and under the rule of the\r\ndukes of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n  See Mühlenbeck, _Documents historiques concernant Ste-Marie aux Mines_\r\n  (Markirch, 1876-1877); Hauser, _Das Bergbaugebiet von Markirch_\r\n  (Strass., 1900).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKLAND, JEREMIAH (1693-1776), English classical scholar, was born at\r\nChildwall in Lancashire on the 29th (or 18th) of October 1693. He was\r\neducated at Christ's Hospital and Peterhouse, Cambridge. He died at\r\nMilton, near Dorking, on the 7th of July 1776.\r\n\r\n  His most important works are _Epistola critica_ (1723), the _Sylvae_\r\n  of Statius (1728), notes to the editions of Lysias by Taylor, of\r\n  Maximus of Tyre by Davies, of Euripides' _Hippolytus_ by Musgrave,\r\n  editions of Euripides' _Supplices_, _Iphigenia in Tauride_ and _in\r\n  Aulide_ (ed. T. Gaisford, 1811); and _Remarks on the Epistles of\r\n  Cicero to Brutus_ (1745).\r\n\r\n  See J. Nichols's _Literary Anecdotes_ (1812), iv. 272; also biography\r\n  by F. A. Wolf, _Literarische Analekten_, ii. 370 (1818).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKO KRALYEVICH, Servian hero, was a son of the Servian king or prince,\r\nVukashin (d. 1371). Chagrined at not himself becoming king after his\r\nfather's death, he headed a revolt against the new ruler of the\r\nServians. Later he passed into the service of the sultan of Turkey, and\r\nwas killed in battle about 1394. Marko, however, is more celebrated in\r\nlegend than in history. He is regarded as the personification of the\r\nServian race, and stories of strength and wonder have gathered round his\r\nname. He is supposed to have lived for 300 years, to have ridden a horse\r\n150 years old, and to have used his enormous physical strength against\r\noppressors, especially against the Turks. He is a great figure in\r\nServian poetry, and his deeds are also told in the epic poems of the\r\nRumanians and the Bulgarians. One tradition relates how he retired from\r\nthe world owing to the advent of firearms, which, he held, made strength\r\nand valour of no account in battle. Goethe regards Marko as the\r\ncounterpart of Hercules and of the Persian Rustem.\r\n\r\n  The Servian poems about him were published in 1878; a German\r\n  translation by Gröber (_Marko, der Königssohn_) appeared at Vienna in\r\n  1883.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARK SYSTEM, the name given to a social organization which rests on the\r\ncommon tenure and common cultivation of the land by small groups of\r\nfreemen. Both politically and economically the mark was an independent\r\ncommunity, and its earliest members were doubtless blood relatives. In\r\nits origin the word is the same as mark or march (q.v.), a boundary.\r\nFirst used in this sense, it was then applied to the land cleared by the\r\nsettlers in the forest areas of Germany, and later it was used for the\r\nsystem which prevailed--to what extent or for how long is uncertain--in\r\nthat country. It is generally assumed that the lands of the mark were\r\ndivided into three portions, forest, meadow and arable, and as in the\r\nmanorial system which was later in vogue elsewhere, a system of rotation\r\nof crops in two, three or even six fields was adopted, each member of\r\nthe community having rights of pasture in the forest and the meadow, and\r\na certain share of the arable. The mark was a self-governing community.\r\nIts affairs were ordered by the markmen who met together at stated times\r\nin the markmoot. Soon, however, their freedom was encroached upon, and\r\nin the course of a very short time it disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nThe extent and nature of the mark system has been, and still is, a\r\nsubject of controversy among historians. One school holds that it was\r\nalmost universal in Germany; that it was, in fact, the typical Teutonic\r\nmethod of holding and cultivating the land. From Germany, it is argued,\r\nit was introduced by the Angle and Saxon invaders into England, where it\r\nwas extensively adopted, being the foundation upon which the prevailing\r\nland system in early England was built. An opposing school denies\r\nentirely the existence of the mark system, and a French writer, Fustel\r\nde Coulanges, refers to it contemptuously as \"a figment of the Teutonic\r\nimagination.\" This view is based largely upon the supposition that\r\ncommon ownership of the land was practically unknown among the early\r\nGermans, and was by no means general among the early English. The truth\r\nwill doubtless be found to lie somewhere between the two extremes. The\r\ncomplete mark system was certainly not prevalent in Anglo-Saxon England,\r\nnor did it exist very widely, or for any very long period in Germany,\r\nbut the system which did prevail in these two countries contained\r\nelements which are also found in the mark system.\r\n\r\n  The chief authority on the mark system is G. L. von Maurer, who has\r\n  written _Einleitung zur Geschichte der Mark- Hof- Dorf- und\r\n  Stadtverfassung und der öffentlichen Gewalt_ (Munich, 1854; new ed.,\r\n  Vienna, 1896), and _Geschichte der Markenverfassung in Deutschland_\r\n  (Erlangen, 1856). See also N. D. Fustel de Coulanges, _Recherches sur\r\n  quelques problèmes de l'histoire_ (1885); and a translation from the\r\n  same writer's works called _The Origin of Property in Land_, by M.\r\n  Ashley. This contains an introductory chapter by Professor W. J.\r\n  Ashley. Other authorities are K. Lamprecht, _Deutsches\r\n  Wirtschaftsleben im Mittelalter_ (Leipzig, 1886); R. Schröder,\r\n  _Lehrbuch der deutschen Rechtsgeschichte_ (Leipzig, 1902); and W.\r\n  Stubbs, _Constitutional History of England_, vol. i. (1891).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARL (from O. Fr. _marle_, Late Lat. _margila_, dim. of _marga_; cf. Du.\r\nand Ger. _Mergel_), a calcareous clay, or a mixture of carbonate of lime\r\nwith argillaceous matter. It is impossible to give a strict definition\r\nof a marl, for the term is applied to a great variety of rocks and soils\r\nwith a considerable range of composition. On the one hand, the marls\r\ngraduate into clays by diminution in the amount of lime that they\r\ncontain, and on the other hand they pass into argillaceous limestones\r\n(see LIMESTONE). From 25-75% of carbonate of lime may be regarded as\r\ncharacteristic of the marls. But in popular usage many substances are\r\ncalled marls which would not be included under the definition given\r\nhere. The practice formerly much in vogue of top-dressing land with\r\nmarls, and the use of many different kinds of earth and clay for that\r\npurpose, has led to a very general misapplication of the term; for all\r\nsorts of rotted rock, some being of igneous origin while others are\r\nrain-wash, loams, and various superficial deposits, have been called\r\n\"marls\" in different parts of Britain, if only it was believed that an\r\napplication of them to the surface of the fields would result in\r\nincreased fertility.\r\n\r\nThe typical marls are soft, earthy, and of a white, grey or brownish\r\ncolour. Many of them disintegrate in water; and they are readily\r\nattacked by dilute hydrochloric acid, which dissolves the carbonate of\r\nlime rapidly, giving off bubbles of carbon dioxide. The lime of some\r\nmarls is present in the form of shells, whole or broken; in others it is\r\na fine impalpable powder mixed with the clay. In many marls there is\r\norganic matter (plant fragments or humus). Sand is usually not abundant\r\nbut is rarely absent. Gypsum occurs in some marls, occasionally in large\r\nsimple crystals with the form of lozenge-shaped plates or in twinned\r\ngroups resembling an arrow-head; fine examples of these are obtained in\r\nthe marls of Montmartre near Paris, where celestine (strontium sulphate)\r\noccurs also in nodular or concretionary masses. Large crystals of\r\ncalcite or of dolomite, lumps of iron pyrites or radiate nodules of\r\nmarcasite, and small crystals of quartz are found in certain marl\r\ndeposits; and in Westphalia the marls of the Senonian (part of the\r\nCretaceous system) at Hamm yield masses of strontianite up to two feet\r\nin length. A very large variety of accessory minerals may be proved to\r\nexist in marls by microscopic examination.\r\n\r\n  The rocks known as shell marls are found in many parts of Britain and\r\n  other northern countries, and are much valued by farmers as a source\r\n  of carbonate of lime, though rarely burned to produce quicklime. They\r\n  are generally obtained by digging pits in marshy spots or meadows, and\r\n  often occur below considerable thicknesses of peat. Large numbers of\r\n  shells of fresh-water mollusca are scattered through a matrix of clay;\r\n  usually retaining their shapes though they are in a friable and\r\n  semi-decomposed state. The species represented are very few, and from\r\n  their unbroken state it is obvious that they have not been\r\n  transported but lived in the place where their remains are found. As\r\n  mollusca of this kind thrive best in open stretches of clear water,\r\n  the sites of the marl deposits must have been shallow lakes and open\r\n  pools.\r\n\r\n  Among the older strata it is not uncommon to find beds which have the\r\n  same composition and in many cases the same origin as shell marl.\r\n  While some of them are fresh-water deposits, others are of marine\r\n  origin. The \"crag beds\" of the Pliocene formation in Norfolk, Suffolk\r\n  and Essex are essentially sand and gravel, which are often rich in\r\n  shells; with them occur clays such as the Chillesford clay; and many\r\n  of these beds have actually been used as marls for dressing the\r\n  surface of agricultural land. Better examples occur among the\r\n  Oligocene beds of the Hampshire basin and the Isle of Wight, where the\r\n  Steadon, Bembridge and Hempstead marls are clays, more or less sandy,\r\n  containing fresh-water shells. In the Cretaceous rocks of the south of\r\n  England soft argillaceous limestones of marine origin, which may be\r\n  described as marls, occur on several horizons. At its base the white\r\n  chalk is often mixed with clay, and the \"chalk marl\" is a rock of this\r\n  kind; it is known in Cambridgeshire, at Folkestone, in the Isle of\r\n  Wight, &c. The chloritic marl, which underlies the chalk and is well\r\n  developed in the Isle of Wight, is a greenish argillaceous limestone,\r\n  the colour being due to the presence of glauconite, not of chlorite;\r\n  it is often very fossiliferous. The Gault, an argillaceous type of the\r\n  Upper Greensand, is a stiff greyish calcareous clay, beneath the white\r\n  chalk, well known for the excellent preservation of its fossils. It\r\n  outcrops along the base of the escarpment of the North and South\r\n  Downs; the original name given to it by William Smith was \"the blue\r\n  marl.\" In the Jurassic rocks of England there are marls or shelly\r\n  fresh-water clays in the Purbeck series and also in the estuarine beds\r\n  of the Great Oolite, but the name \"marlstone\" has long been reserved\r\n  for the argillaceous limestone of the Middle Lias. It ranges from the\r\n  Dorset coast, through Edge Hill in Warwickshire and Lincolnshire, and\r\n  thence to the sea in the north of Yorkshire, presenting many\r\n  variations in this long extent of country and often accompanied by, or\r\n  converted into, beds of clay ironstone. The marlstone is typically a\r\n  firm, greyish limestone weathering to a rusty brown colour, and is\r\n  always more or less argillaceous.\r\n\r\n  In the Triassic rocks of Britain there is a very important series of\r\n  red, green and mottled clays, over a thousand feet thick in some\r\n  places, which have been called the New Red marls. They belong to the\r\n  Keuper or uppermost division of the system, and in Cheshire contain\r\n  valuable deposits of rock salt, the principal sources of that mineral\r\n  in Great Britain. In the strict sense these rocks are not marls, being\r\n  ferruginous clays rather than calcareous clays. Most of them appear to\r\n  have been laid down in saline lakes in desert regions. As a rule they\r\n  contain very few fossils, and often they have little or no carbonate\r\n  of lime, but beds and veins of fibrous gypsum occur in them in\r\n  considerable profusion. These rocks cover a wide area in the midland\r\n  counties extending to the south coast near Exmouth, and reappear in\r\n  the north in the Vale of Eden and a few places in southern Scotland.\r\n  The clays are used for brick-making, and yield a stiff soil, mostly\r\n  devoted to pasture and dairy farming. In the Rhaetic beds which\r\n  immediately overlie the Triassic rocks there are three seams of\r\n  calcareous clay, often only a few feet thick, which have been called\r\n  the \"grey marls\" and the \"tea-green marls.\"\r\n\r\n  To rocks older than these the name marl has not often been given,\r\n  probably because, though argillaceous limestones are often common in\r\n  the Carboniferous and Silurian rocks, they are usually firm and\r\n  compact, while marls usually comprise rocks which are more or less\r\n  soft and friable. In other countries, and especially in Germany, many\r\n  different kinds of marl and of marl-slate are described. Two of these\r\n  are of especial importance--the dark copper-bearing marl slate of the\r\n  Permian rocks near Mansfeld in Germany, which has been long and\r\n  extensively worked as sources of copper, and the white or creamy\r\n  Solenhofen limestone, much quarried in Bavaria, and used as a\r\n  lithographic stone.

James Ley, the 1st earl (c.\r\n1550-1629), was lord chief justice of the King's Bench in Ireland and\r\nthen in England; he was an English member of parliament and was lord\r\nhigh treasurer from 1624 to 1628. In 1624 he was created Baron Ley and\r\nin 1626 earl of Marlborough. The 3rd earl was his grandson James\r\n(1618-1665), a naval officer who was killed in action with the Dutch.\r\nJames was succeeded by his uncle William, a younger son of the 1st earl,\r\non whose death in 1679 the earldom became extinct.\r\n\r\nIn 1689 John Churchill was created earl and in 1702 duke of Marlborough\r\n(see below). After the death of his only son Charles in 1703 an act of\r\nparliament was passed in 1706 settling the duke's titles upon his\r\ndaughters and their issue. Consequently when he died in June 1722 his\r\neldest daughter Henrietta (1681-1733), wife of Francis Godolphin, 2nd\r\nearl of Godolphin, became duchess of Marlborough. She died without sons\r\nand was succeeded by her nephew Charles Spencer, 5th earl of Sunderland\r\n(1706-1758), a son of the great duke's second daughter Anne (d. 1716).\r\nAlthough at this time Charles handed over the Sunderland estates to his\r\nyounger brother John, the ancestor of the earls Spencer, he did not\r\nobtain Blenheim until Sarah, the dowager duchess, died in 1744. His\r\neldest son George Spencer, the 4th duke (1739-1817), left three sons.\r\nThe eldest, George Spencer, the 5th duke (1766-1840), was summoned to\r\nthe House of Lords as Baron Spencer of Wormleighton in 1806, and in\r\n1817, after succeeding to the dukedom, he took the name of\r\nSpencer-Churchill. The 4th duke's second son was Lord Henry John Spencer\r\n(1770-1795), envoy to Sweden and to Prussia; and his third son was Lord\r\nFrancis Almeric Spencer (1779-1845), who was created a peer as Baron\r\nChurchill of Whichwood in 1815. His grandson Victor Albert Francis\r\nCharles Spencer (b. 1864) succeeded his father as 3rd Baron Churchill in\r\n1886, and was raised to the rank of a viscount in 1902.\r\n\r\nThe 7th duke of Marlborough, John Winston Spencer-Churchill (1822-1883),\r\na prominent Conservative politician, was lord-lieutenant of Ireland\r\n1876-1880, and when marquess of Blandford (the courtesy title borne by\r\nthe duke's eldest son in his father's lifetime) was responsible for the\r\nact of 1856 called the \"Blandford Act,\" enabling populous parishes to be\r\ndivided for purposes of Church work. In 1892 his grandson Charles\r\nRichard John Spencer-Churchill (b. 1871) became 9th duke of Marlborough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLBOROUGH, JOHN CHURCHILL, 1ST DUKE OF (1650-1722), English soldier,\r\nwas born in the small manor house of Ash, in Musbury, Devonshire, near\r\nAxminster, in May or June 1650. Arabella Churchill, his eldest sister,\r\nand the mother of the duke of Berwick, was born in the same house on the\r\n28th of February 1648. They were the children of Winston Churchill of\r\nGlanville Wotton in Dorset and Elizabeth the fourth daughter of Sir John\r\nDrake, who died in 1636; his widow, after the close of the civil war,\r\nreceived her son-in-law into her own house. From 1663 to 1665 John\r\nChurchill went to St Paul's school, and there is a tradition that during\r\nthis period he showed the bent of his taste by reading and re-reading\r\nVegetius _De re militari_. When fifteen years old he became page of\r\nhonour to the duke of York, and about the same time his sister Arabella\r\nbecame maid of honour to the duchess, two events which contributed\r\ngreatly to the advancement of the Churchills. On the 14th of September\r\n1667 he received through the influence of his master a commission in the\r\nGuards, and left England for service at Tangier but returned home in the\r\nwinter of 1670-1671. For a short interval Churchill remained in\r\nattendance at the court, and it was during this period that the natural\r\ncarefulness of his disposition was shown by his investing in an annuity\r\na present of £5,000 given him by the duchess of Cleveland.\r\n\r\nIn June 1672, when England to her shame sent six thousand troops to aid\r\nLouis XIV. in his attempt to subdue the Dutch, Churchill was made a\r\ncaptain in the company of which the duke of York was colonel, and soon\r\nattracted the attention of Turenne, by whose profound military genius\r\nthe whole army was directed. At the siege of Nimeguen Churchill\r\nacquitted himself with such success that the French commander predicted\r\nhis ultimate rise to distinction. When Maestricht was besieged in June\r\n1673 he saved the life of the duke of Monmouth, and received the thanks\r\nof Louis XIV. for his services. In 1678 he was married to Sarah Jennings\r\n(b. June 5, 1660), the favourite attendant on the Princess Anne, younger\r\ndaughter of the duke of York. Her father, Richard Jennings of Sandridge,\r\nnear St Albans, had twenty-two brothers and sisters; one of the latter\r\nmarried a London tradesman named Francis Hill, and their daughter\r\nAbigail Hill afterwards succeeded her cousin the duchess of Marlborough\r\nas favourite to Queen Anne.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James II. the Churchills received a great increase\r\nin fortune. Colonel Churchill had been created a Scotch peer as Lord\r\nChurchill of Eyemouth on the 21st of December 1682; and as a reward for\r\nhis services in going on a special mission from the new monarch to Louis\r\nXIV. he was advanced on the 14th of May 1685 to the English peerage\r\nunder the title of Baron Churchill of Sandridge in Hertfordshire. When\r\nthe duke of Monmouth attempted his ill-fated enterprise in the western\r\ncounties, the second position in command of the king's army was bestowed\r\non Lord Churchill, and on the 3rd of July 1685 he was raised to the rank\r\nof major-general. Through his vigilance and energy at the battle of\r\nSedgemoor (July 6) victory declared itself on the king's side. After the\r\ndeath of Monmouth he withdrew as far as possible from the administration\r\nof public business, but both he and his wife remained the favourite\r\nattendants of the princess Anne. Whilst on his embassy to the French\r\ncourt he had declared with emphasis that if the king of England should\r\nchange the religion of the state he should at once leave his service,\r\nand it was not long before the design of James became apparent to the\r\nworld. Churchill was one of the first to send overtures of obedience to\r\nthe prince of Orange, to whom he had gone on a commission in 1678.\r\nAlthough he continued in a high position under James and drew the\r\nemoluments of his places, he promised William of Orange to use every\r\nexertion to bring over the troops to his side. James had been warned\r\nagainst putting any trust in the loyalty of the man on whom he had\r\nshowered so many favours, but the warnings were in vain, and on the\r\nlanding of the Dutch prince at Brixham Churchill was promoted to be\r\nlieutenant-general (Nov. 7, 1688) and was sent against him with five\r\nthousand men. When the royal army had advanced to the downs of Wiltshire\r\nand a battle seemed imminent, James was dismayed at finding that in the\r\ndead of night his general had stolen away like a thief into the opposite\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nChurchill was sworn as a privy councillor on the 14th of February 1688/9\r\nand on the 9th of April became earl of Marlborough. William felt,\r\nhowever, that he could not place implicit reliance in his friend's\r\nintegrity; and, with a clear sense of the manner in which Marlborough's\r\ntalents might be employed without any detriment to the stability of his\r\nthrone, he sent him in June 1689 with the army into the Netherlands, and\r\nin the autumn of 1690 into Ireland, where owing to his generalship Cork\r\nand Kinsale fell into his hands after short sieges. For some time there\r\nwas no open avowal of any distrust in Marlborough's loyalty, but in May\r\n1692 he was thrown into the Tower on an accusation of treason. Though\r\nthe evidence which could be brought against him was slight, and he was\r\nsoon set at liberty, there is no doubt that Marlborough was in close\r\nrelations with the exiled king at St Germains, and that he even went so\r\nfar as to disclose, in May 1694, to his late master the intention of the\r\nEnglish to attack the town of Brest. The talents of the statesmen of\r\nthis reign were chiefly displayed in their attempts to convince both the\r\nexiled and the reigning king of England of their attachment to his\r\nfortunes. The sin of Marlborough lay in the fact that he had been\r\nfavoured above his fellows by each in turn, and that he betrayed both\r\nalike apparently without scruple or without shame. Once again during the\r\nFenwick plot of 1696 he was charged with treason, but William, knowing\r\nthat if he pushed Marlborough and his friends to extremities there were\r\nno other statesmen on whom he could rely, contented himself with\r\nignoring the accusation of Sir John Fenwick, and with executing that\r\nconspirator himself. In 1698 the forgiven traitor was made governor to\r\nthe young duke of Gloucester, the only one of Anne's numerous children\r\nwho gave promise of attaining to manhood. During the last years of\r\nWilliam's reign Marlborough once more was placed in positions of\r\nresponsibility. His daughters were married into the most prominent\r\nfamilies of the land; Henrietta, the eldest, became the wife of Francis,\r\nthe eldest son of Lord Godolphin; the second, the loveliest woman at the\r\ncourt, with her father's tact and temper and her mother's beauty,\r\nmarried Charles, Lord Spencer, the only surviving son of the earl of\r\nSunderland. Higher honours came on the accession of Queen Anne in March\r\n1702. He was at once appointed a Knight of the Garter, captain-general\r\nof the English troops both at home and abroad, and master-general of the\r\nordnance. The new queen did not forget the life-long service of his\r\nwife; three positions at the court by which she was enabled to continue\r\nby the side of the sovereign were united in her person. The queen showed\r\nher devotion to her friend by another signal mark of favour. The\r\nrangership of Windsor Park was granted her for life, with the especial\r\nobject of enabling Lady Marlborough to live in the Great Lodge. These\r\nwere the opening days of many years of fame and power. A week or two\r\nafter the death of William it was agreed by the three great powers,\r\nEngland, Holland and Austria, which formed the grand alliance, that war\r\nshould be declared against France on the same day, and on the 4th of May\r\n1702 the War of the Spanish Succession was declared by the three\r\ncountries. Marlborough was made commander-in-chief of the united armies\r\nof England and Holland, but throughout the war his plans were impeded by\r\nthe jealousy of the commanders who were nominally his inferiors, and by\r\nthe opposite aims of the various countries that were striving to break\r\nthe power of France. He himself wished to penetrate into the French\r\nlines; the anxiety of the Dutch was for the maintenance of their\r\nfrontier and for an augmentation of their territory; the desire of the\r\nAustrian emperor was to secure that his son the Archduke Charles should\r\nrule over Spain. To secure concerted action by these different powers\r\ntaxed all the diplomacy of Marlborough, but he succeeded for the most\r\npart in his desires. In the first year of the campaign it was shown that\r\nthe armies of the French were not invincible. Several fortresses which\r\nLouis XIV. had seized upon surrendered to the allies. Kaiserswerth on\r\nthe Rhine surrendered on the 15th of June, and Venlo on the Meuse on the\r\n23rd of September. The prosperous commercial town of Liége with its\r\ncommanding citadel capitulated on the 29th of October. The successes of\r\nMarlborough caused much rejoicing in his own country, and for these\r\nbrilliant exploits he was raised (Dec. 14, 1702) to be duke of\r\nMarlborough, and received a grant of £5000 per annum for the queen's\r\nlife. In the spring of the following year a crushing blow fell upon the\r\nduke and duchess. Their eldest and only surviving son, the marquess of\r\nBlandford, was seized whilst at King's College, Cambridge (under the\r\ncare of Francis Hare, afterwards bishop of Chichester), with the\r\nsmall-pox, and died on the 20th of February 1703, in his seventeenth\r\nyear. His talents had already justified the prediction that he would\r\nrise to the highest position in the state.\r\n\r\nThe result of the campaign of 1703 inspired the French king with fresh\r\nhopes of ultimate victory. The dashing plans of Marlborough were\r\nfrustrated by the opposition of his Dutch colleagues. When he wished to\r\ninvade the French territory they urged him to besiege Bonn, and he was\r\ncompelled to accede to their wishes. It surrendered on the 15th of May,\r\nwhereupon he returned to his original plan of attacking Antwerp; but, in\r\nconsequence of the incapacity of the Dutch leaders, the generals\r\n(Villeroi and Boufflers) of the French army surprised the Dutch division\r\non the 30th of June and inflicted on it a loss of many thousands of men.\r\nMarlborough was forced to abandon his enterprise, and all the\r\ncompensation which he received was the capture of the insignificant\r\nforts of Huy and Limburg. After a year of comparative failure for the\r\nallies, Louis XIV. was emboldened to enter upon an offensive movement\r\nagainst Austria; and Marlborough, smarting under the misadventures of\r\n1703, was eager to meet him. A magnificent army was sent by the French\r\nking, under the command of Marshal Tallard, to join the forces of the\r\nelector of Bavaria and to march by the Danube so as to seize Vienna\r\nitself. Marlborough divined the intention of the expedition, and while\r\nmaking a feint of marching into Alsace led his troops into Bavaria. The\r\ntwo armies (that under Marlborough and Prince Eugène numbering more than\r\nfifty thousand men, whilst Tallard's forces were nearly four thousand\r\nstronger) met in battle near the village of Blenheim on the left bank of\r\nthe Danube. The French commander made the mistake of supposing that the\r\nenemy's attack would be directed against his position in the village,\r\nand he concentrated an excessive number of his troops at that point. The\r\nearly part of the fight was in favour of the French. Three times were\r\nthe troops led by Prince Eugène, which were attacking the Bavarians, the\r\nenemy's left wing, driven back in confusion; Marlborough's cavalry\r\nfailed on their first attack in breaking the line of the enemy's\r\ncentre. But in the end the victory of the allies was conclusive. Nearly\r\nthirty thousand of the French and Bavarians were killed and wounded, and\r\neleven thousand of the French who had been driven down to the Danube\r\nwere forced to surrender. Bavaria fell into the hands of the allies.\r\nNever was a victory more eagerly welcomed than this, and never was a\r\nconquering leader more rewarded than Marlborough. Poets and prose\r\nwriters were employed to do him honour, and the lines of Addison\r\ncomparing the English commander to the angel who passed over \"pale\r\nBritannia\" in the storm of 1703 have been famous for over two centuries.\r\nThe manor of Woodstock, which was transferred by act of parliament from\r\nthe crown to the duke, was a reward more after his own heart. The gift\r\neven in that form was noble, but the queen heightened it by instructing\r\nSir John Vanbrugh to build a palace in the park at the royal expense,\r\nand £240,000 of public money was spent on the buildings. He was also\r\ncreated a prince of the empire and the principality of Mindelheim was\r\nformed in his honour.\r\n\r\nThe following year was not marked by any stirring incident. Marlborough\r\nwas hampered by tedious formalities at the Hague and by jealousies at\r\nthe German courts. The armies of the French were again brought up to\r\ntheir full standard, but the generals of Louis were instructed to\r\nentrench themselves behind earthworks and to act on the defensive. In\r\nthe darkness of a July night these lines were broken through near\r\nTirlemont, and the French were forced to take shelter under the walls of\r\nLouvain. Marlborough in vain urged an attack upon them in their new\r\nposition, and when 1705 had passed away the forces of the French king\r\nhad suffered no diminution. This immunity from disaster tempted Villeroi\r\nin the next spring into meeting the allied forces in an open fight, but\r\nhis assurance proved his ruin. Through the superior tactics of\r\nMarlborough the battle of Ramillies (May 23, 1706) ended in the total\r\nrout of the French, and caused the transference of nearly the whole of\r\nBrabant and Flanders to the allies. Five days afterwards the victor\r\nentered Brussels in state, and the inhabitants acknowledged the rule of\r\nthe archduke. Antwerp and Ostend surrendered themselves with slight\r\nloss. Menin held out until three thousand of the soldiers of the allies\r\nwere laid low around its walls, but Dendermonde, which Louis had forty\r\nyears previously besieged in vain, quickly gave itself up to the\r\nresistless Marlborough. Again a year of activity and triumph was\r\nsucceeded by a period of languor and depression. During the whole of\r\n1707 fortune inclined to the other side, with the result that in July\r\n1708 Ghent and Bruges returned to the allegiance of the French, and\r\nMarlborough, fearing that their example might be followed by the other\r\ncities, advanced with his whole army towards Oudenarde. Had the counsels\r\nof Vendôme, one of the ablest of the French generals, prevailed, the\r\nfight might have had a different issue, but his suggestions were\r\ndisregarded by the duke of Burgundy, the grandson of Louis, and the\r\nbattle, which raged on the high ground above Oudenarde, ended in their\r\ndefeat (July 11, 1708). After this victory Marlborough, ever anxious for\r\ndecisive measures, wished to advance on Paris, but he was overruled. The\r\nallied army invested the town of Lille, on the fortifications of which\r\nVauban had expended an immensity of thought; and after a struggle of\r\nnearly four months, and the loss to the combatants of thirty thousand\r\nmen, the citadel was surrendered by Marshal Boufflers on the 9th of\r\nDecember. By the end of the year Brabant was again subject to the rule\r\nof the allies. The suffering in France at this time weighed so heavily\r\nupon the people that its proud king humbled himself to sue for peace.\r\nEach of the allies in turn did he supplicate, and Torcy his minister\r\nendeavoured by promises of large sums of money to obtain the support of\r\nMarlborough to his proposals. These attempts were in vain, and when the\r\nwinter passed away a French army of one hundred and ten thousand, under\r\nthe command of Villars, took the field. On the 3rd of September 1709\r\nTournay capitulated, and the two leaders, Marlborough and Eugène, led\r\ntheir forces to Mons, in spite of the attempt of Villars to prevent\r\nthem. For the last time during the protracted war the two armies met in\r\nfair fight at Malplaquet, on the south of Mons (Sept. 11, 1709), where\r\nthe French leader had strengthened his position by extensive earthworks.\r\nThe fight was long and doubtful, and although the French ultimately\r\nretreated under the direction of Boufflers, for Villars had been wounded\r\non the knee, it was in good order, and their losses were less than those\r\nof their opponents. The campaign lasted for a year or two after this\r\nindecisive contest, but it was not signalized by any such \"glorious\r\nvictory\" as Blenheim. All that the English could plume themselves on was\r\nthe acquisition of a few such fortresses as Douai and Bethune, and all\r\nthat the French had to fear was the gradual tightening of the enemy's\r\nchain until it reached the walls of Paris. The energies of the French\r\nwere concentrated in the construction of fresh lines of defence, until\r\ntheir commander boasted that his position was impregnable. In this way\r\nthe war dragged on until the conclusion of the Peace of Utrecht in June\r\n1712.\r\n\r\nThese victorious campaigns had not prevented the position of Marlborough\r\nfrom being undermined by party intrigues at home. In the early part of\r\nQueen Anne's reign his political friends were to be found among the\r\nTories, and the ministry under Sidney Godolphin was chiefly composed of\r\nmembers of that party. After a year or two, however, the more ardent\r\nTories withdrew, and two younger adherents of the same cause, Harley and\r\nSt John, were introduced in May 1704 into the ministry. The duchess,\r\npartly through the influence of her son-in-law, the earl of Sunderland,\r\nwho came into office against the queen's wish on the 3rd of December\r\n1706, and partly through the opposition of the Tories to the French war,\r\nhad gone over to the Whig cause, and she pressed her views on the\r\nsovereign with more vehemence than discretion. She had obtained for her\r\nindigent cousin, Abigail Hill, a small position at court, and the poor\r\nrelation very soon began to injure the benefactor who had befriended\r\nher. With Hill's assistance Harley and St John widened the breach with\r\nthe queen which was commenced by the imperious manner of the duchess.\r\nThe love of the two friends changed into hate, and no opportunity for\r\nhumiliating the family of Marlborough was allowed to pass neglected.\r\nSunderland and Godolphin were the first to fall (July-Aug. 1710); a few\r\nmonths later the duchess was dismissed from her offices; and, although\r\nMarlborough himself was permitted to continue in his position a short\r\ntime longer, his fall was only delayed until the last day of 1711. Life\r\nin England had become so unpleasant that he went to the Continent in\r\nNovember 1712 and remained abroad until the death of Anne (Aug. 1,\r\n1714).\r\n\r\nThen he once more returned to England and resumed his old military\r\nposts, but he took little part in public affairs. Even if he had wished\r\nto regain his commanding position in the country, ill health would have\r\nprevented him from obtaining his desires. Johnson indeed says, in the\r\n_Vanity of Human Wishes_, that \"the streams of dotage\" flowed from his\r\neyes; but this is a poetical exaggeration. It is certain that at the\r\ntime of his death he was able to understand the remarks of others and to\r\nexpress his own wishes. At four o'clock on the morning of the 16th of\r\nJune 1722 he died at Cranbourn Lodge, near Windsor. His remains were at\r\nfirst deposited in Westminster Abbey, in the vault at the east end of\r\nKing Henry VII.'s chapel, but they now rest in a mausoleum in the chapel\r\nat Blenheim.\r\n\r\nHis widow, to whom must be assigned a considerable share both in his\r\nrise and in his fall, survived till the 18th of October 1744. Those\r\nyears were spent in bitter animosity with many within and without her\r\nown family. Left by her husband with the command of boundless wealth,\r\nshe used it for the vindication of his memory and for the justification\r\nof her own resentment. Two of the leading opponents of the Whig\r\nministry, Chesterfield and Pitt, were especially honoured by her\r\nattentions. To Pitt she left ten thousand pounds, to the other statesman\r\ntwice that sum and a reversionary interest in her landed property at\r\nWimbledon. Whilst a widow she received numerous offers of marriage from\r\ntitled suitors. She refused them all: from her marriage to her death her\r\nheart had no other inmate than the man as whose wife she had become\r\nalmost a rival to royalty.\r\n\r\nThe rapid rise of Marlborough to the highest position in the State was\r\ndue to his singular tact and his diplomatic skill in the management of\r\nmen. In an age remarkable for grace of manner and for adroitness of\r\ncompliment, his courteous demeanour and the art with which he refused or\r\ngranted a favour extorted the admiration of every one with whom he came\r\nin contact. Through his consideration for the welfare of his soldiers he\r\nheld together for years an army drawn from every nation in Christendom.\r\nHis talents may not have been profound (he possessed \"an excellent plain\r\nunderstanding and sound judgment\" is the opinion of Lord Chesterfield),\r\nbut they were such as Englishmen love. Alike in planning and in\r\nexecuting, he took infinite pains in all points of detail. Nothing\r\nescaped his observation, and in the hottest moment of the fight the\r\ncoolness of his intellect shone conspicuous. His enemies indeed affected\r\nto attribute his uniform success in the field to fortune, and they\r\nmagnified his love of money by drawing up balance sheets which included\r\nevery penny which he had received, but omitted the pounds which he had\r\nspent in the cause he had sincerely at heart. All that can be alleged in\r\nexcuse of his attempts to serve two masters, the king whom he had\r\ndeserted and the king who had received him into favour, is that not one\r\nof his associates was without sin in this respect.\r\n\r\n  The books on Marlborough are very numerous. Under his name in the\r\n  catalogue of the British Museum there are 165 entries, and 44 under\r\n  that of his wife. The chief works are Lediard's, Archdeacon William\r\n  Coxe's (1818-1819), Sir Archibald Alison's (1855), and Viscount\r\n  Wolseley's (1894) _Lives_, but Wolseley stops with the accession of\r\n  Queen Anne; a French memoir in three volumes, 1808; Marlborough's\r\n  _Letters and Despatches_, edited by Sir George Murray (5 vols., 1845);\r\n  and the interesting summaries of Mrs Creighton (1879) and George\r\n  Saintsbury (1885). The descriptions in John Hill Burton's _Reign of\r\n  Queen Anne_ of the battle scenes of Marlborough are from personal\r\n  observation. A good account of his birthplace and country will be\r\n  found in G. P. R. Pulman's _Book of the Axe District_ (4th ed., 1875);\r\n  and for the home of the duchess the reader can refer to the _History\r\n  of Hertfordshire_, by J. E. Cussans. A memoir of her, by one of her\r\n  descendants, Mrs Arthur Colville, appeared in 1904. The pamphlets\r\n  written on her conduct at court relate to matters of little interest\r\n  at the present time.     (W. P. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLBOROUGH, a market town and municipal borough in the Devizes\r\nparliamentary division of Wiltshire, England, 75¾ m. W. of London, on\r\nthe Great Western and the Midland and South Western Junction railways.\r\nPop. (1901), 3887. It is an old-fashioned place on the skirts of\r\nSavernake Forest, lying in a valley of the chalk uplands known as\r\nMarlborough Downs, and traversed by the river Kennet. It consists mainly\r\nof one broad street, in which a majority of the houses are Jacobean;\r\nthose on the north side, which have projecting upper storeys, forming\r\nthe colonnade commended in the Diary of Samuel Pepys for 1668. St\r\nPeter's church, a Perpendicular building, is said to have been the scene\r\nof the ordination of Cardinal Wolsey in 1498. The church of Preshute,\r\nlargely rebuilt, but preserving its Norman pillars, has a curious\r\npiscina, and a black basalt font of great size dating from 1100-1150, in\r\nwhich according to a very old tradition King John was baptized. Other\r\nnoteworthy buildings are the town-hall, 16th century grammar school and\r\nMarlborough College. This important public school was opened in 1843,\r\noriginally for the sons of clergymen, by whom alone certain scholarships\r\nare tenable. The number of boys is about 600. Marlborough possesses\r\nlittle trade other than agricultural; but there are breweries, tanneries\r\nand roperies. The town is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12\r\ncouncillors. Area, 598 acres.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of Marlborough is shown by the Castle Mound, a British\r\nearthwork, which local legend makes the grave of Merlin; and the name of\r\nMarlborough has been regarded as a corrupt form of Merlin's Berg or\r\nRock.\r\n\r\nNear the site of the modern Marlborough (_Merleberge_, _Marleberge_) was\r\noriginally a Roman _castrum_ called Cunetio, and later there was a\r\nNorman fortress in which William I. established a mint. In Domesday it\r\nwas royal demesne and during the following centuries figures in numerous\r\ngrants generally as the dowry of queens. The castle, built under Henry\r\nI., by Roger, bishop of Salisbury, was held for Matilda against Stephen,\r\nand became a favourite residence of Henry II., Savernake being a royal\r\ndeer-park. In 1267 Henry III. held his last parliament here, at which\r\nthe Statute of Marlborough was passed. The castle ceased to be an\r\nimportant stronghold after the Wars of the Roses, but was garrisoned for\r\nCharles I. by its owners, the Seymour family. Marlborough itself,\r\nhowever, is mentioned by Clarendon as \"the most notoriously disaffected\r\n[town] in Wiltshire,\" and was captured by the royal forces in 1642, and\r\npartly burnt. At the Restoration Charles II. was received and\r\nmagnificently entertained by Lord Seymour, whose mansion forms the\r\noldest part of Marlborough College. The town was constituted a suffragan\r\nsee by Henry II. Sacheverell, the politician and divine, was born here\r\nin 1674, and educated at the grammar school. In 1653 the town was nearly\r\ndestroyed by fire, and it again suffered in 1679 and 1690; after which\r\nan act was passed forbidding the use of thatch. Marlborough, from its\r\nposition on the Great Bath Road, was a famous coaching centre.\r\n\r\nThe first charter was granted by John in 1204, and conferred a gild\r\nmerchant, together with freedom from all pleas except pleas of the Crown\r\nand from all secular exactions by sea and land. This was confirmed by\r\nsubsequent sovereigns from Henry III. to Henry VIII. Later charters were\r\nobtained from Henry IV. in 1407 and from Elizabeth in 1576. The former\r\ngranted some additional exemptions whilst the latter incorporated the\r\ntown under the title of mayor and burgesses of Marlborough. The\r\ncorporation was finally reconstructed in 1835 under the title of a\r\nmayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Marlborough returned two members\r\nto parliament until 1867 when the number was reduced to one, and in 1885\r\nthe representation was merged in that of the county. A yearly fair was\r\ngranted by John in 1204, for eight days from August 14, and two more by\r\nHenry III. for three days from November 11 and June 29 respectively. In\r\n1204 John also granted a weekly market on Wednesday and Saturday. In\r\nTudor times the corn trade prospered here.\r\n\r\n  See \"Victoria County History\": _Wilts_; James Waglen, _History of\r\n  Marlboro_ (London, 1854).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLBOROUGH, a city of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., about 28\r\nm. W. of Boston. Pop. (1900), 13,609 (3311 were foreign-born); (1910),\r\n14,579; it is served by the Boston & Maine and the New York New Haven &\r\nHartford railways, and by interurban electric lines. The city, with a\r\ntotal area of 21.08 sq. m., lies in a fertile hilly country, and\r\ncontains several ponds, including the beautiful Williams Pond, which\r\ncovers ¼ sq. m. A public library was established here in 1792; it was\r\nhoused in a new building in 1904. Other public buildings are the city\r\nhall, the Federal building and a state armoury. There is a boarding\r\nschool for girls, St Ann's Academy (1887), under the direction of the\r\nSisters of St Ann. The city's importance is industrial; in 1905 its\r\nfactory product was valued at $7,468,849 (an increase of 66% since\r\n1900), of which 88.6% was the value of boots and shoes. Whether the city\r\nis named from Marlborough in Wiltshire, or, as seems more probable,\r\nbecause of early spellings \"Marlberg\" and \"Marlbridge,\" from the\r\npresence of marl in the neighbourhood, is uncertain. Settlers from\r\nSudbury in 1665 took possession of a hill called by the Indians\r\nWhipsuffenicke and gradually hemmed in the Christian Indian village of\r\nOckoocangansett (or Ognoikonguamescitt), on an adjoining hill still\r\nbearing this name. The town was incorporated in 1660. It was destroyed\r\nby Indians in March 1676, during King Philip's war, and was abandoned\r\nfor a year. Westborough was separated from it in 1717, Southborough in\r\n1727, and a part of Berlin in 1784; parts of it were annexed to\r\nNorthborough in 1807, to Bolton in 1829 and to Hudson in 1866; and it\r\nannexed parts of Framingham in 1791, and of Southborough in 1843. In\r\n1890 it was incorporated as a city.\r\n\r\n  See S. A. Drake, _History of Middlesex County_, ii. 137 sqq.,\r\n  \"Marlborough\" by Rev. R. S. Griffin and E. L. Bigelow (Boston, 1880).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLITT, E., the pseudonym of EUGENIE JOHN (1825-1887), German novelist,\r\nwho was born at Arnstadt in Thuringia, the daughter of a merchant, on\r\nthe 5th of December 1825. By her musical talent she attracted the notice\r\nof the reigning princess of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, who provided for\r\nher training as a singer at the Vienna Conservatoire. After three years'\r\nstudy she made a successful stage début, but was compelled in\r\nconsequence of deafness to abandon this career. She then became reader\r\nand travelling companion to her patroness, and her life at the court and\r\non her many travels furnished her with material for her novels. In 1863\r\nshe resigned her post, and then lived with her brother at Arnstadt until\r\nher death on the 22nd of June 1887.\r\n\r\n  Her first novel, _Die zwölf Apostel_, was published in the\r\n  _Gartenlaube_ in 1865 and this was followed in 1866 by _Goldelse_\r\n  (23rd ed., 1890), with which she established her literary reputation.\r\n  Among others of her novels may be mentioned _Blaubart_ (1866); _Das\r\n  Geheimnis der alten Mamsell_ (1867; 13th ed., 1888); _Reichsgräfin\r\n  Gisela_ (1869; 9th ed., 1900), _Das Heideprinzesschen_ (1871; 8th ed.,\r\n  1888) and _Im Hause des Kommerzienrats_ (1877; 5th ed., 1891). All\r\n  these works are directed against social prejudices, but, although\r\n  attractively written, are deficient in higher literary qualities and\r\n  appeal mostly to juvenile readers.\r\n\r\n  E. Marlitt's _Gesammelte Romane und Novellen_ were published in 10\r\n  volumes (1888-1890; 2nd ed., 1891-1894), to which is appended a\r\n  biographical memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLOW (GREAT MARLOW), a market town in the Wycombe parliamentary\r\ndivision of Buckinghamshire, England, 31½ m. W. of London on a branch of\r\nthe Great Western railway. Pop. of urban district (1901), 4526. It is\r\nbeautifully situated on the north (left) bank of the Thames, which is\r\nhere confined closely between low wooded hills. A weir and lock, near\r\nwhich rise the high tower and spire of the modern church of All Saints,\r\nseparate two fine reaches of the river, and the town is a favourite\r\nresort for boating and fishing. The village of Little Marlow, where the\r\nfoundations of a Benedictine nunnery of the time of Henry III. have been\r\nrevealed by excavation, lies near the river two miles below. The town\r\nis, as a whole, modern in appearance, but a few old houses remain, such\r\nas the grammar school, founded as a bluecoat school in 1624, adjoining\r\nwhich is a house occupied by the poet Shelley in 1817. The town has\r\nmanufactures of chairs, lace and embroidery, paper mills and breweries.\r\n\r\nGreat Marlow (_Merlaue_, _Merlawe_, _Marlowe_, _Marlow_) appears as a\r\nmanor in Domesday Book, but its \"borough and liberties\" are not\r\nmentioned before 1261. It was then held by the earls of Gloucester, and\r\nits importance was probably due to the bridge across the Thames, first\r\nbuilt, according to tradition, by the Templars at Bisham. No charter of\r\nincorporation was ever granted to the town, but there are faint traces\r\nof its constitution in the 14th century. In 1342 the mayor and burgesses\r\npresented to a chantry and continued to be the patrons till 1394. Later\r\nwrits addressed to the town only mention two bailiffs as officers of the\r\nborough, nor were the pontage rights and dues held by it until the 15th\r\ncentury. Two burgesses sat in parliament from 1300 to 1309, but the\r\nrepresentation of the borough lapsed until 1621, when the right to\r\nreturn members was re-established. After the Reform Bill of 1832 the\r\nboundaries of the parliamentary borough were enlarged, but in 1867 its\r\nrepresentation was reduced to one member, and in 1885 was merged in that\r\nof the county. No grant of a market in the borough has been found, but a\r\nmarket was held by the Despensers who had succeeded the De Clares as\r\nlords of the manor in the 14th century. In the 16th century the market\r\nseems to have been given up, but it was revived and held in the 18th\r\ncentury, only to disappear again before 1862. Fairs were mentioned in\r\n1306 on the death of Gilbert de Clare, when they were held on St Luke's\r\nDay and on the Wednesday in Whit-week by the earl of Gloucester, and\r\nHugh le Despenser was granted a fair in his manor of Marlow in 1324. In\r\n1792 there were two fairs, one of which, for horses and cattle, is still\r\nheld on the 29th of October. Lace and satin-stitch work used to be made\r\nto a considerable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLOWE, CHRISTOPHER (1564-1593), English dramatist, the father of\r\nEnglish tragedy, and instaurator of dramatic blank verse, the eldest son\r\nof a shoemaker at Canterbury, was born in that city on the 6th of\r\nFebruary 1564. He was christened at St George's Church, Canterbury, on\r\nthe 26th of February, 1563/4, some two months before Shakespeare's\r\nbaptism at Stratford-on-Avon. His father, John Marlowe, is said to have\r\nbeen the grandson of John Morley or Marlowe, a substantial tanner of\r\nCanterbury. The father, who survived by a dozen years or so his\r\nillustrious son, married on the 22nd of May 1561 Catherine, daughter of\r\nChristopher Arthur, at one time rector of St Peter's, Canterbury, who\r\nhad been ejected by Queen Mary as a married minister. The dramatist\r\nreceived the rudiments of his education at the King's School,\r\nCanterbury, which he entered at Michaelmas 1578, and where he had as his\r\nfellow-pupils Richard Boyle, afterwards known as the great earl of Cork,\r\nand Will Lyly, the brother of the dramatist. Stephen Gosson entered the\r\nsame school a little before, and William Harvey, the famous physician, a\r\nlittle after Marlowe. He went to Cambridge as one of Archbishop Parker's\r\nscholars from the King's School, and matriculated at Benet (Corpus\r\nChristi) College, on the 17th of March 1571, taking his B.A. degree in\r\n1584, and that of M.A. three or four years later.\r\n\r\nFrancis Kett, the mystic, burnt in 1589 for heresy, was a fellow and\r\ntutor of his college, and may have had some share in developing\r\nMarlowe's opinions in religious matters. Marlowe's classical\r\nacquirements were of a kind which was then extremely common, being based\r\nfor the most part upon a minute acquaintance with Roman mythology, as\r\nrevealed in Ovid's _Metamorphoses_. His spirited translation of Ovid's\r\n_Amores_ (printed 1596), which was at any rate commenced at Cambridge,\r\ndoes not seem to point to any very intimate acquaintance with the\r\ngrammar and syntax of the Latin tongue. Before 1587 he seems to have\r\nquitted Cambridge for London, where he attached himself to the Lord\r\nAdmiral's Company of Players, under the leadership of the famed actor\r\nEdward Alleyn, and almost at once began writing for the stage. Of\r\nMarlowe's career in London, apart from his four great theatrical\r\nsuccesses, we know hardly anything; but he evidently knew Thomas Kyd,\r\nwho shared his unorthodox opinions. Nash criticized his verse, Greene\r\naffected to shudder at his atheism; Gabriel Harvey maligned his memory.\r\nOn the other hand Marlowe was intimate with the Walsinghams of Scadbury,\r\nChiselhurst, kinsmen of Sir Francis Walsingham: he was also the personal\r\nfriend of Sir Walter Raleigh, and perhaps of the poetical earl of\r\nOxford, with both of whom, and with such men as Walter Warner and Robert\r\nHughes the mathematicians, Thomas Harriott the notable astronomer, and\r\nMatthew Royden, the dramatist is said to have met in free converse.\r\nEither this free converse or the licentious character of some of the\r\nyoung dramatist's tirades seems to have sown a suspicion among the\r\nstrait-laced that his morals left everything to be desired. It is\r\nprobable enough that this attitude of reprobation drove a man of so\r\nexalted a disposition as Marlowe into a more insurgent attitude than he\r\nwould have otherwise adopted. He seems at any rate to have been\r\nassociated with what was denounced as Sir Walter Raleigh's school of\r\natheism, and to have dallied with opinions which were then regarded as\r\nputting a man outside the pale of civilized humanity. As the result of\r\nsome depositions made by Thomas Kyd under the influence of torture, the\r\nPrivy Council were upon the eve of investigating some serious charges\r\nagainst Marlowe when his career was abruptly and somewhat scandalously\r\nterminated. The order had already been issued for his arrest, when he\r\nwas slain in a quarrel by a man variously named (Archer and Ingram) at\r\nDeptford, at the end of May 1593, and he was buried on the 1st of June\r\nin the churchyard of St Nicholas at Deptford. The following September\r\nGabriel Harvey referred to him as \"dead of the plague.\" The disgraceful\r\nparticulars attached to the tragedy of Marlowe in the popular mind would\r\nnot seem to have appeared until four years later (1597) when Thomas\r\nBeard, the Puritan author of _The Theatre of God's Judgements_, used the\r\ndeath of this playmaker and atheist as one of his warning examples of\r\nthe vengeance of God. Upon the embellishments of this story, such as\r\nthat of Francis Meres the critic, in 1598, that Marlowe came to be\r\n\"stabbed to death by a bawdy servingman, a rival of his in his lewde\r\nlove,\" or that of William Vaughan in the _Golden Grove_ of 1600, in\r\nwhich the unfortunate poet's dagger is thrust into his own eye in\r\nprevention of his felonious assault upon an innocent man, his guest, it\r\nis impossible now to pronounce. We really do not know the circumstances\r\nof Marlowe's death. The probability is he was killed in a brawl, and his\r\natheism must be interpreted not according to the _ex parte_ accusation\r\nof one Richard Baines, a professional informer (among the Privy Council\r\nrecords), but as a species of rationalistic antinomianism, dialectic in\r\ncharacter, and closely related to the deflection from conventional\r\northodoxy for which Kett was burnt at Norwich in 1589. A few months\r\nbefore the end of his life there is reason to believe that he\r\ntransferred his services from the Lord Admiral's to Lord Strange's\r\nCompany, and may have thus been brought into communication with\r\nShakespeare, who in such plays as _Richard II._ and _Richard III._ owed\r\nnot a little to the influence of his romantic predecessor.\r\n\r\nMarlowe's career as a dramatist lies between the years 1587 and 1593,\r\nand the four great plays to which reference has been made were\r\n_Tamburlaine the Great_, an heroic epic in dramatic form divided into\r\ntwo parts of five acts each (1587, printed in 1590); _Dr Faustus_ (1588,\r\nentered at Stationers' Hall 1601); _The Famous Tragedy of the Rich Jew\r\nof Malta_ (dating perhaps from 1589, acted in 1592, printed in 1633);\r\nand _Edward the Second_ (printed 1594). The very first words of\r\n_Tamburlaine_ sound the trumpet note of attack in the older order of\r\nthings dramatic:--\r\n\r\n  \"From jigging veins of riming mother wits\r\n   And such conceits as clownage keeps in pay\r\n   We'll lead you to the stately tent of war,\r\n   Where you shall hear the Scythian Tamburlaine\r\n   Threatening the world with high astounding terms\r\n   And scourging kingdoms with his conquering sword.\"\r\n\r\nIt leapt with a bound to a place beside Kyd's _Spanish Tragedy_, and few\r\nplays have been more imitated by rivals (Greene's _Alphonsus of Aragon_,\r\nPeek's _Battle of Alcazar, Selimus, Scanderbeg_) or more keenly\r\nsatirized by the jealousy and prejudice of out-distanced competitors.\r\n     (T. Se.)\r\n\r\nThe majestic and exquisite excellence of various lines and passages in\r\nMarlowe's first play must be admitted to relieve, if it cannot be\r\nallowed to redeem, the stormy monotony of Titanic truculence which\r\nblusters like a simoom through the noisy course of its ten fierce acts.\r\nWith many and heavy faults, there is something of genuine greatness in\r\n_Tamburlaine the Great_; and for two grave reasons it must always be\r\nremembered with distinction and mentioned with honour. It is the first\r\npoem ever written in English blank verse, as distinguished from mere\r\nrhymeless decasyllabics; and it contains one of the noblest passages,\r\nperhaps indeed the noblest, in the literature of the world, ever written\r\nby one of the greatest masters of poetry in loving praise of the\r\nglorious delights and sublime submission to the everlasting limits of\r\nhis art. In its highest and most distinctive qualities, in unfaltering\r\nand infallible command of the right note of music and the proper tone of\r\ncolour for the finest touches of poetic execution, no poet of the most\r\nelaborate modern school, working at ease upon every consummate resource\r\nof luxurious learning and leisurely refinement, has ever excelled the\r\nbest and most representative work of a man who had literally no models\r\nbefore him and probably or evidently was often if not always compelled\r\nto write against time for his living.\r\n\r\nThe just and generous judgment passed by Goethe on the _Faustus_ of his\r\nEnglish predecessor in tragic treatment of the same subject is somewhat\r\nmore than sufficient to counterbalance the slighting or the sneering\r\nreferences to that magnificent poem which might have been expected from\r\nthe ignorance of Byron or the incompetence of Hallam. And the particular\r\nnote of merit observed, the special point of the praise conferred, by\r\nthe great German poet should be no less sufficient to dispose of the\r\nvulgar misconception yet lingering among sciolists and pretenders to\r\ncriticism, which regards a writer than whom no man was ever born with a\r\nfiner or a stronger instinct for perfection of excellence in execution\r\nas a mere noble savage of letters, a rough self-taught sketcher or\r\nscribbler of crude and rude genius, whose unhewn blocks of verse had in\r\nthem some veins of rare enough metal to be quarried and polished by\r\nShakespeare. What most impressed the author of _Faust_ in the work of\r\nMarlowe was a quality the want of which in the author of _Manfred_ is\r\nproof enough to consign his best work to the second or third class at\r\nmost. \"How greatly it is all planned!\" the first requisite of all great\r\nwork, and one of which the highest genius possible to a greatly gifted\r\nbarbarian could by no possibility understand the nature or conceive the\r\nexistence. That Goethe \"had thought of translating it\" is perhaps hardly\r\nless precious a tribute to its greatness than the fact that it has been\r\nactually and admirably translated by the matchless translator of\r\nShakespeare--the son of Victor Hugo; whose labour of love may thus be\r\nsaid to have made another point in common, and forged as it were another\r\nlink of union, between Shakespeare and the young master of Shakespeare's\r\nyouth. Of all great poems in dramatic form it is perhaps the most\r\nremarkable for absolute singleness of aim and simplicity of\r\nconstruction; yet is it wholly free from all possible imputation of\r\nmonotony or aridity. _Tamburlaine_ is monotonous in the general roll and\r\nflow of its stately and sonorous verse through a noisy wilderness of\r\nperpetual bluster and slaughter; but the unity of tone and purpose in\r\n_Doctor Faustus_ is not unrelieved by change of manner and variety of\r\nincident. The comic scenes, written evidently with as little of labour\r\nas of relish, are for the most part scarcely more than transcripts,\r\nthrown into the form of dialogue, from a popular prose _History of Dr\r\nFaustus_, and therefore should be set down as little to the discredit as\r\nto the credit of the poet. Few masterpieces of any age in any language\r\ncan stand beside this tragic poem--it has hardly the structure of a\r\nplay--for the qualities of terror and splendour, for intensity of\r\npurpose and sublimity of note. In the vision of Helen, for example, the\r\nintense perception of loveliness gives actual sublimity to the sweetness\r\nand radiance of mere beauty in the passionate and spontaneous selection\r\nof words the most choice and perfect; and in like manner the sublimity\r\nof simplicity in Marlowe's conception and expression of the agonies\r\nendured by Faustus under the immediate imminence of his doom gives the\r\nhighest note of beauty, the quality of absolute fitness and propriety,\r\nto the sheer straightforwardness of speech in which his agonizing horror\r\nfinds vent ever more and more terrible from the first to the last\r\nequally beautiful and fearful verse of that tremendous monologue which\r\nhas no parallel in all the range of tragedy.\r\n\r\nIt is now a commonplace of criticism to observe and regret the decline\r\nof power and interest after the opening acts of _The Jew of Malta_. This\r\ndecline is undeniable, though even the latter part of the play (the text\r\nof which is very corrupt) is not wanting in rough energy; but the first\r\ntwo acts would be sufficient foundation for the durable fame of a\r\ndramatic poet. In the blank verse of Milton alone--who perhaps was\r\nhardly less indebted than Shakespeare was before him to Marlowe as the\r\nfirst English master of word-music in its grander forms--has the glory\r\nor the melody of passages in the opening soliloquy of Barabbas been\r\npossibly surpassed. The figure of the hero before it degenerates into\r\ncaricature is as finely touched as the poetic execution is excellent;\r\nand the rude and rapid sketches of the minor characters show at least\r\nsome vigour and vivacity of touch.\r\n\r\nIn _Edward the Second_ the interest rises and the execution improves as\r\nvisibly and as greatly with the course of the advancing story as they\r\ndecline in _The Jew of Malta_. The scene of the king's deposition at\r\nKenilworth is almost as much finer in tragic effect and poetic quality\r\nas it is shorter and less elaborate than the corresponding scene in\r\nShakespeare's _King Richard II_. The terror of the death-scene\r\nundoubtedly rises into horror; but this horror is with skilful\r\nsimplicity of treatment preserved from passing into disgust. In pure\r\npoetry, in sublime and splendid imagination, this tragedy is excelled by\r\n_Doctor Faustus_; in dramatic power and positive impression of natural\r\neffect it is certainly the masterpiece of Marlowe. It was almost\r\ninevitable, in the hands of any poet but Shakespeare, that none of the\r\ncharacters represented should be capable of securing or even exciting\r\nany finer sympathy or more serious interest than attends on the mere\r\nevolution of successive events or the mere display of emotions (except\r\nalways in the great scene of the deposition) rather animal than\r\nspiritual in their expression of rage or tenderness or suffering. The\r\nexact balance of mutual effect, the final note of scenic harmony,\r\nbetween ideal conception and realistic execution is not yet struck with\r\nperfect accuracy of touch and security of hand; but on this point also\r\nMarlowe has here come nearer by many degrees to Shakespeare than any of\r\nhis other predecessors have ever come near to Marlowe.\r\n\r\nOf _The Massacre at Paris_ (acted in 1593, printed 1600?) it is\r\nimpossible to judge fairly from the garbled fragment of its genuine text\r\nwhich is all that has come down to us. To Mr Collier, among numberless\r\nother obligations, we owe the discovery of a noble passage excised in\r\nthe piratical edition which gives us the only version extant of this\r\nunlucky play, and which, it must be allowed, contains nothing of quite\r\nequal value. This is obviously an occasional and polemical work, and\r\nbeing as it is overcharged with the anti-Catholic passion of the time\r\nhas a typical quality which gives it some empirical significance and\r\ninterest. That antipapal ardour is indeed the only note of unity in a\r\nrough and ragged chronicle which shambles and stumbles onward from the\r\ndeath of Queen Jeanne of Navarre to the murder of the last Valois. It is\r\npossible to conjecture, what it would be fruitless to affirm, that it\r\ngave a hint in the next century to Nathaniel Lee for his far superior\r\nand really admirable tragedy on the same subject, issued ninety-seven\r\nyears after the death of Marlowe.\r\n\r\nIn the tragedy of _Dido Queen of Carthage_ (completed by Thomas Nash,\r\nproduced and printed 1594), a servile fidelity to the text of Virgil's\r\nnarrative has naturally resulted in the failure which might have been\r\nexpected from an attempt at once to transcribe what is essentially\r\ninimitable and to reproduce it under the hopelessly alien conditions of\r\ndramatic adaptation. The one really noble passage in a generally feeble\r\nand incomposite piece of work is, however, uninspired by the\r\nunattainable model to which the dramatists have been only too obsequious\r\nin their subservience. It is as nearly certain as anything can be which\r\ndepends chiefly upon cumulative and collateral evidence that the better\r\npart of what is best in the serious scenes of _King Henry VI._ is mainly\r\nthe work of Marlowe. That he is at any rate the principal author of the\r\nsecond and third plays passing under that name among the works of\r\nShakespeare, but first and imperfectly printed as _The Contention\r\nbetween the two Famous Houses of York and Lancaster_, can hardly be now\r\na matter of debate among competent judges. The crucial difficulty of\r\ncriticism in this matter is to determine, if indeed we should not rather\r\nsay to conjecture, the authorship of the humorous scenes in prose,\r\nshowing as they generally do a power of comparatively high and pure\r\ncomic realism to which nothing in the acknowledged works of any\r\npre-Shakespearian dramatist is even remotely comparable. Yet, especially\r\nin the original text of these scenes as they stand unpurified by the\r\nultimate revision of Shakespeare or his editors, there are tones and\r\ntouches which recall rather the clownish horseplay and homely ribaldry\r\nof his predecessors than anything in the lighter interludes of his very\r\nearliest plays. We find the same sort of thing which we find in their\r\nwritings, only better done than they usually do it, rather than such\r\nwork as Shakespeare's a little worse done than usual. And even in the\r\nfinal text of the tragic or metrical scenes the highest note struck is\r\nalways, with one magnificent and unquestionable exception, rather in the\r\nkey of Marlowe at his best than of Shakespeare while yet in great\r\nmeasure his disciple.\r\n\r\n_A Taming of a Shrew_, the play on which Shakespeare's comedy was\r\nfounded, has been attributed, without good reason, to Marlowe. The\r\npassages in the play borrowed from Marlowe's works provide an argument\r\nagainst, rather than for his authorship; while the humorous character of\r\nthe play is not in keeping with his other work. He may have had a share\r\nin _The Troublesome Raigne of King John_ (1591), and Fleay conjectured\r\nthat the plays _Edward III._ and _Richard III._ usually included in\r\neditions of Shakespeare are at least based on plays by Marlowe. _Lust's\r\nDominion_, printed in 1657, was incorrectly ascribed to him, and a play\r\nno longer extant, _The True History of George Scanderbage_, was assumed\r\nby Fleay on the authority of an obscure passage of Gabriel Harvey to be\r\nhis work. _The Maiden's Holiday_, assigned to Day and Marlowe, was\r\ndestroyed by Warburton's cook. Day was considerably Marlowe's junior,\r\nand collaboration between the two is not probable.\r\n\r\nHad every copy of Marlowe's boyish version or perversion of Ovid's\r\n_Elegies_ (P. Ovidii Nasonis _Amorum_ compressed into three books)\r\ndeservedly perished in the flames to which it was judicially condemned\r\nby the sentence of a brace of prelates, it is possible that an\r\noccasional bookworm, it is certain that no poetical student, would have\r\ndeplored its destruction, if its demerits could in that case have been\r\nimagined. His translation of the first book of Lucan alternately rises\r\nabove the original and falls short of it,--often inferior to the Latin\r\nin point and weight of expressive rhetoric, now and then brightened by a\r\nclearer note of poetry and lifted into a higher mood of verse. Its\r\nterseness, vigour and purity of style would in any case have been\r\npraiseworthy, but are nothing less than admirable, if not wonderful,\r\nwhen we consider how close the translator has on the whole (in spite of\r\noccasional slips into inaccuracy) kept himself to the most rigid limit\r\nof literal representation, phrase by phrase and often line by line. The\r\nreally startling force and felicity of occasional verses are worthier of\r\nremark than the inevitable stiffness and heaviness of others, when the\r\ntechnical difficulty of such a task is duly taken into account.\r\n\r\nOne of the most faultless lyrics and one of the loveliest fragments in\r\nthe whole range of descriptive and fanciful poetry would have secured a\r\nplace for Marlowe among the memorable men of his epoch, even if his\r\nplays had perished with himself. His _Passionate Shepherd_ remains ever\r\nsince unrivalled in its way--a way of pure fancy and radiant melody\r\nwithout break or lapse. The untitled fragment, on the other hand, has\r\nbeen very closely rivalled, perhaps very happily imitated, but only by\r\nthe greatest lyric poet of England--by Shelley alone. Marlowe's poem of\r\n_Hero and Leander_ (entered at Stationers' Hall in September 1593;\r\ncompleted and brought out by George Chapman, who divided Marlowe's work\r\ninto two sestiads and added four of his own, 1598), closing with the\r\nsunrise which closes the night of the lovers' union, stands alone in its\r\nage, and far ahead of the work of any possible competitor between the\r\ndeath of Spenser and the dawn of Milton. In clear mastery of narrative\r\nand presentation, in melodious ease and simplicity of strength, it is\r\nnot less pre-eminent than in the adorable beauty and impeccable\r\nperfection of separate lines or passages. It is doubtful whether the\r\nheroic couplet has ever been more finely handled.\r\n\r\nThe place and the value of Christopher Marlowe as a leader among English\r\npoets it would be almost impossible for historical criticism to\r\nover-estimate. To none of them all, perhaps, have so many of the\r\ngreatest among them been so deeply and so directly indebted. Nor was\r\never any great writer's influence upon his fellows more utterly and\r\nunmixedly an influence for good. He first, and he alone, guided\r\nShakespeare into the right way of work; his music, in which there is no\r\necho of any man's before him, found its own echo in the more prolonged\r\nbut hardly more exalted harmony of Milton's. He is the greatest\r\ndiscoverer, the most daring and inspired pioneer, in all our poetic\r\nliterature. Before him there was neither genuine blank verse nor a\r\ngenuine tragedy in our language. After his arrival the way was prepared,\r\nthe paths were made straight, for Shakespeare.     (A. C. S.)\r\n\r\n  Marlowe's fame, so finely appreciated by Shakespeare and Drayton, was\r\n  in obscuration from the fall of the theatres until the generation of\r\n  Lamb and Hazlitt. A collected edition was brought out by Pickering in\r\n  1826. This was greatly improved upon by A. Dyce (1858, 1865, 1876). A\r\n  one-volume edition was prepared by Colonel Francis Cunningham in 1871.\r\n  The standard edition of Mr A. H. Bullen in 3 vols. appeared in\r\n  1884-1885 and is now under revision. The \"Best Plays\" were edited for\r\n  the Mermaid series by Havelock Ellis with an Introduction by J. A.\r\n  Symonds (1887-1889). The best modern text is that edited by C. F.\r\n  Tucker Brooke (Oxf. Univ. Press, 1910). A sketch in outline of\r\n  Marlowe's Life was essayed by J. G. Lewis (Canterbury, 1891). A not\r\n  very conclusive monograph on _Christopher Marlowe and his Associates_\r\n  by J. H. Ingram, followed in 1904. For further information the reader\r\n  should consult the histories of the stage by Collier, Ward, Fleay,\r\n  Schelling, and the studies of Shakespeare's Predecessors by Symonds,\r\n  Mezières, Boas, Manley, Churton Collins, Feuillerat and J. M.\r\n  Robertson. See also Verity's _Essay on Marlowe's Influence_ (1886);\r\n  _Mod. Lang. Rev._ iv. 167 (M. at Cambridge); Swinburne, _Study of\r\n  Shakespeare_ (1880); Elze, _Notes_, and Hazlitt _Dramatic Lit. of the\r\n  Age of Elizabeth_; _Fortnightly Review_, xiii., lxxi., and Sept.-Oct.,\r\n  1905; Jusserand, _Hist. of English Lit._; the _Cambridge Hist. of\r\n  English Lit._; Seccombe and Allen, _Age of Shakespeare_ (vol. ii. 3rd\r\n  ed., 1909), and the separate editions of _Dr Faustus_, _Edward II._,\r\n  &c. The main sources of Marlowe were as follows: for _Tamburlaine_,\r\n  Pedro Mexia's _Life of Timur_ in his _Silva_ (Madrid, 1543),\r\n  anglicized by Fortescue in his _Foreste_ (1571) and Petrus Perondinus\r\n  _Vita Magni Tamerlanis_ (1551); for _Faustus_: a contemporary English\r\n  version of the Faust-buch or _Historia von D. Johann Fausten_\r\n  (Frankfort, 1587), and for _Edward II._, the _Chronicles_ of Fabyan\r\n  (1516), Holinshed (1577) and Stow (1580).     (T. Se.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLOWE, JULIA [SARAH FRANCES FROST] (1870-   ), American actress, was\r\nborn near Keswick, England, on the 17th of August 1870, and went with\r\nher family to America in 1875. Her first formal appearance on the stage\r\nwas in New York in 1887, although she had before that travelled with a\r\njuvenile opera company in _H.M.S. Pinafore_, and afterwards was given\r\nsuch parts as Maria in _Twelfth Night_ in Miss Josephine Riley's\r\ntravelling company. Her first great success was as Parthenia in\r\n_Ingomar_, and her subsequent presentations of Rosalind, Viola, and\r\nJulia in _The Hunchback_ confirmed her position as a \"star.\" In 1894 she\r\nmarried Robert Taber, an actor, with whom she played until their divorce\r\nin 1900. Subsequently she had great success as Barbara Frietchie in\r\nClyde Fitch's play of that name, and other dramas; and from 1904 to 1907\r\nshe acted with E. H. Sothern in a notable series of Shakespeare plays,\r\nas well as in modern drama.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARLY-LE-ROI, a village of northern France in the department of\r\nSeine-et-Oise, 5 m. N. by W. of Versailles by road. Pop. (1906), 1409.\r\nNotwithstanding some fine country houses, Marly is dull and\r\nunattractive, and owes all its celebrity to the sumptuous château built\r\ntowards the end of the 17th century by Louis XIV., and now destroyed. It\r\nwas originally designed as a simple hermitage to which the king could\r\noccasionally retire with a few of his more intimate friends from the\r\npomp of Versailles, but gradually it grew until it became one of the\r\nmost ruinous extravagances of the Grand Monarque. The central pavilion\r\n(inhabited by the king himself) and its twelve subsidiary pavilions were\r\nintended to suggest the sun surrounded by the signs of the zodiac.\r\nSeldom visited by Louis XV., and wholly abandoned by Louis XVI., it was\r\ndemolished after the Revolution, its art treasures having previously\r\nbeen dispersed, and the remains now consist of a large basin, the\r\nAbreuvoir, a few mouldering ivy-grown walls, some traces of parterres\r\nwith magnificent trees, the park, and the forest of 8½ sq. m., one of\r\nthe most pleasant promenades of the neighbourhood of Paris, containing\r\nthe shooting preserves of the President of the Republic.\r\n\r\nClose to the Seine, half-way between Marly-le-Roi and St Germain, is the\r\nvillage of Port-Marly, and one mile farther up is the hamlet of\r\nMarly-la-Machine. Here, in 1684, an immense hydraulic engine, driven by\r\nthe current of the river, was erected; it raised the water to a high\r\ntower, where the aqueduct of Marly began (700 yds. in length, 75 in\r\nheight, with 36 arches, still well-preserved), carrying the waters of\r\nthe Seine to Versailles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMALADE (adopted from Fr. _marmelade_, from _marmelo_, a quince,\r\nderived through the Lat. _melimelum_, from Gr. [Greek: meli], honey, and\r\n[Greek: mêlon], an apple, an apple grafted on a quince), a preserve\r\noriginally made of quinces, but now commonly of Seville oranges. The\r\n\"marmalade-tree\" (_Lucuma mammosa_) bears a fruit whose thick pulp\r\nresembles marmalade and is called natural marmalade. \"Marmalade box\" is\r\nthe name of the fruit of the _Genipa Americana_, which opens in the same\r\nmanner as a walnut, the nut being replaced by a soft pulp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMANDE, a town of south-western France, capital of an arrondissement\r\nin the department of Lot-et-Garonne, 35 m. N.W. of Agen, on the Southern\r\nrailway from Bordeaux to Cette. Pop. (1906), town 6373; commune, 9748.\r\nMarmande is situated at the confluence of the Trec with the Garonne on\r\nthe right bank of the latter river, which is here crossed by a\r\nsuspension bridge. Public institutions include the sub-prefecture, the\r\ntribunals of first instance and commerce, the communal college and\r\nschools of commerce and industry and of agriculture. Apart from the\r\nadministrative offices, the only building of importance is the church of\r\nNôtre-Dame, which dates from the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. The\r\ngraceful windows of the nave, the altarpiece of the 18th century, and in\r\nparticular, the Renaissance cloister adjoining the south side, are its\r\nmost interesting features. Among the industries are iron-founding, steam\r\nsawing, the manufacture of woollens, carriage-making, cooperage and\r\nbrandy-distilling. There is a large trade in wine, plums, cattle, grain\r\nand other agricultural produce.\r\n\r\nMarmande was a _bastide_ founded about 1195 on the site of a more\r\nancient town by Richard Coeur de Lion, who granted it a liberal measure\r\nof self-government. Its position on the banks of the Garonne made it an\r\nimportant place of toll. It soon passed into the hands of the counts of\r\nToulouse, and was three times besieged and taken during the Albigensian\r\ncrusade, its capture by Amaury de Montfort in 1219 being followed by a\r\nmassacre of the inhabitants. It was united to the French crown under\r\nLouis IX. A short occupation by the English in 1447, an unsuccessful\r\nsiege by Henry IV. in 1577 and its resistance of a month to a division\r\nof Wellington's army in 1814, are the chief events in its subsequent\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMIER, XAVIER (1809-1892), French author, was born at Pontarlier, in\r\nDoubs, on the 24th of June 1809. He had a passion for travelling, and\r\nthis he combined throughout his life with the production of literature.\r\nAfter journeying in Switzerland, Belgium and Holland, he was attached in\r\n1835 to the Arctic expedition of the \"Recherche\"; and after a couple of\r\nyears at Rennes as professor of foreign literature, he visited (1842)\r\nRussia, (1845) Syria, (1846) Algeria, (1848-1849) North and South\r\nAmerica, and numerous volumes from his pen were the result. In 1870 he\r\nwas elected to the Academy, and he was for many years prominently\r\nidentified with the Sainte-Geneviève library. He did much to encourage\r\nthe study of Scandinavian literature in France, publishing translations\r\nof Holberg, Oehlenschläger and others. He died in Paris on the 11th of\r\nOctober 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMONT, AUGUSTE FRÉDÉRIC LOUIS VIESSE DE, DUKE OF RAGUSA (1774-1852),\r\nmarshal of France, was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine, on the 20th of July\r\n1774. He was the son of an ex-officer in the army who belonged to the\r\n_petite noblesse_ and adopted the principles of the Revolution. His love\r\nof soldiering soon showing itself, his father took him to Dijon to learn\r\nmathematics prior to entering the artillery, and there he made the\r\nacquaintance of Bonaparte, which he renewed after obtaining his\r\ncommission when he served in Toulon. The acquaintance ripened into\r\nintimacy; Marmont became General Bonaparte's aide-de-camp, remained with\r\nhim during his disgrace and accompanied him to Italy and Egypt, winning\r\ndistinction and promotion to general of brigade. In 1799 he returned to\r\nEurope with his chief; he was present at the _coup d'état_ of the 18th\r\nBrumaire, and organized the artillery for the expedition to Italy, which\r\nhe commanded with great effect at Marengo. For this he was at once made\r\ngeneral of division. In 1801 he became inspector-general of artillery,\r\nand in 1804 grand officer of the Legion of Honour, but was greatly\r\ndisappointed at being omitted from the list of officers who were made\r\nmarshals. In 1805 he received the command of a corps, with which he did\r\ngood service at Ulm. He was then directed to take possession of Dalmatia\r\nwith his army, and occupied Ragusa. For the next five years he was\r\nmilitary and civil governor of Dalmatia, and traces of his beneficent\r\nrégime still survive both in great public works and in the memories of\r\nthe people. In 1808 he was made duke of Ragusa, and in 1809, being\r\nsummoned by Napoleon to take part in the Austrian War, he marched to\r\nVienna and bore a share in the closing operations of the campaign.\r\nNapoleon now made him a marshal and governor-general of all the Illyrian\r\nprovinces of the empire. In July 1810 Marmont was hastily summoned to\r\nsucceed Masséna in the command of the French army in the north of Spain.\r\nThe skill with which he manoeuvred his army during the year he commanded\r\nit has been always acknowledged. His relief of Ciudad Rodrigo in the\r\nautumn of 1811 in spite of the presence of the English army was a great\r\nfeat, and in the manoeuvring which preceded the battle of Salamanca he\r\nhad the best of it. But Wellington more than retrieved his position in\r\nthe battle (see SALAMANCA), and inflicted a severe defeat on the French,\r\nMarmont himself being gravely wounded in the right arm and side. He\r\nretired to France to recover, and was still hardly cured when in April\r\n1813 Napoleon, who soon forgot his fleeting resentment for the defeat,\r\ngave him the command of a corps. With it he served at the battles of\r\nLützen, Bautzen and Dresden, and throughout the great defensive campaign\r\nof 1814 until the last battle before Paris, from which he drew back his\r\nforces to the commanding position of Essonne. Here he had 20,000 men in\r\nhand, and was the pivot of all thoughts. Napoleon said of this camp of\r\nEssonne, \"C'est là que viendront s'addresser toutes les intrigues,\r\ntoutes les trahisons; aussi y ai-je placé Marmont, mon enfant élevé sous\r\nma tente.\" Marmont then took upon himself a political rôle which has, no\r\ndoubt justly, been stigmatized as ungrateful and treasonable. A secret\r\nconvention was concluded, and Marmont's corps was surrounded by the\r\nenemy. Napoleon, who still hoped to retain the crown for his infant son,\r\nwas prostrated, and said with a sadness deeper than violent words,\r\n\"Marmont me porte le dernier coup.\"\r\n\r\nThis act was never forgiven by Marmont's countrymen. On the restoration\r\nof the Bourbons he was indeed made a peer of France and a major-general\r\nof the royal guard, and in 1820 a knight of the Saint Esprit and a grand\r\nofficer of the order of St Louis; but he was never trusted. He was the\r\nmajor-general of the guard on duty in July 1830, and was ordered to put\r\ndown with a strong hand any opposition to the ordinances (see FRANCE).\r\nHimself opposed to the court policy, he yet tried to do his duty, and\r\nonly gave up the attempt to suppress the revolution when it became clear\r\nthat his troops were outmatched. This brought more obloquy upon him, and\r\nthe duc d'Angoulême even ordered him under arrest, saying, \"Will you\r\nbetray us, as you betrayed him?\" Marmont did not betray them; he\r\naccompanied the king into exile and forfeited his marshalate thereby.\r\nHis desire to return to France was never gratified and he wandered in\r\ncentral and eastern Europe, settling finally in Vienna, where he was\r\nwell received by the Austrian government, and strange to say made tutor\r\nto the duke of Reichstadt, the young man who had once for a few weeks\r\nbeen styled Napoleon II. He died at Venice on the 22nd of March 1852.\r\n\r\nMuch of his time in his last years was spent upon his _Mémoires_, which\r\nare of great value for the military history of his time, though they\r\nmust be read as a personal defence of himself in various junctures\r\nrather than as an unbiased account of his times. They show Marmont, as\r\nhe really was, an embittered man, who never thought his services\r\nsufficiently requited, and above all, a man too much in love with\r\nhimself and his own glory to be a true friend or a faithful servant. His\r\nstrategy indeed tended to become pure virtuosity, and his tactics,\r\nthough neat, appear frigid and antiquated when contrasted with those of\r\nthe instinctive leaders, the fighting generals whom the theorists affect\r\nto despise. But his military genius is undeniable, and he was as far\r\nsuperior to the mere theorist as Lannes and Davout were to the pure\r\n_divisionnaire_ or \"fighting\" general.\r\n\r\n  His works are _Voyage en Hongrie_, &c. (4 vols., 1837); _Voyage en\r\n  Sicile_ (1838); _Esprit des institutions militaires_ (1845); _César_;\r\n  _Xenophon_; and _Mémoires_ (8 vols., published after his death in\r\n  1856). See the long and careful notice by Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du\r\n  Lundi_, vol. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMONTEL, JEAN FRANÇOIS (1723-1799), French writer, was born of poor\r\nparents at Bort, in Cantal, on the 11th of July 1723. After studying\r\nwith the Jesuits at Mauriac, he taught in their colleges at Clermont and\r\nToulouse; and in 1745, acting on the advice of Voltaire, he set out for\r\nParis to try for literary honours. From 1748 to 1753 he wrote a\r\nsuccession of tragedies which,[1] though only moderately successful on\r\nthe stage, secured the admission of the author to literary and\r\nfashionable circles. He wrote for the _Encyclopédie_ a series of\r\narticles evincing considerable critical power and insight, which in\r\ntheir collected form, under the title _Éléments de Littérature_, still\r\nrank among the French classics. He also wrote several comic operas, the\r\ntwo best of which probably are _Sylvain_ (1770) and _Zémire et Azore_\r\n(1771). In the Gluck-Piccini controversy he was an eager partisan of\r\nPiccini with whom he collaborated in _Didon_ (1783) and _Pénélope_\r\n(1785). In 1758 he gained the patronage of Madame de Pompadour, who\r\nobtained for him a place as a civil servant, and the management of the\r\nofficial journal _Le Mercure_, in which he had already begun the famous\r\nseries of _Contes moraux_. The merit of these tales lies partly in the\r\ndelicate finish of the style, but mainly in the graphic and charming\r\npictures of French society under Louis XV. The author was elected to the\r\nFrench Academy in 1763. In 1767 he published a romance, _Bélisaire_, now\r\nremarkable only on account of a chapter on religious toleration which\r\nincurred the censure of the Sorbonne and the archbishop of Paris.\r\nMarmontel retorted in _Les Incas_ (1778) by tracing the cruelties in\r\nSpanish America to the religious fanaticism of the invaders.\r\n\r\nHe was appointed historiographer of France (1771), secretary to the\r\nAcademy (1783), and professor of history in the Lycée (1786). In his\r\ncharacter of historiographer Marmontel wrote a history of the regency\r\n(1788) which is of little value. Reduced to poverty by the Revolution,\r\nMarmontel in 1792 retired during the Terror to Evreux, and soon after to\r\na cottage at Abloville in the department of Eure. To that retreat we owe\r\nhis _Mémoires d'un père_ (4 vols., 1804) giving a picturesque review of\r\nhis whole life, a literary history of two important reigns, a great\r\ngallery of portraits extending from the venerable Massillon, whom more\r\nthan half a century previously he had seen at Clermont, to Mirabeau. The\r\nbook was nominally written for the instruction of his children. It\r\ncontains an exquisitely drawn picture of his own childhood in the\r\nLimousin; its value for the literary historian is very great. Marmontel\r\nlived for some time under the roof of Mme Geoffrin, and was present at\r\nher famous dinners given to artists; he was, indeed, an _habitué_ of\r\nmost of the houses where the encyclopaedists met. He had thus at his\r\ncommand the best material for his portraits, and made good use of his\r\nopportunities. After a short stay in Paris when elected in 1797 to the\r\nConseil des Anciens, he died on the 31st of December 1799 at Abloville.\r\n\r\n  See Sainte-Beuve, _Causeries du lundi_, iv.; Morellet, _Éloge_ (1805).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] _Denys le Tyran_ (1748); _Aristomène_ (1749); _Cléopâtre_ (1750);\r\n    _Héraclides_ (1752); _Egyptus_ (1753).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMORA (anc. _Proconnesus_), an island in the sea of the same name.\r\nOriginally settled by Greeks from Miletus in the 8th century B.C.,\r\nProconnesus was annexed by its powerful neighbour Cyzicus in 362.

It is 170 m.\r\nlong (E. to W.) and nearly 50 m. in extreme width, and has an area of\r\n4500 sq. m. Its greatest depth is about 700 fathoms, the deepest parts\r\n(over 500 fathoms) occurring in three depressions in the northern\r\nportion--one close under the European shore to the south of Rodosto,\r\nanother near the centre of the sea, and a third at the mouth of the Gulf\r\nof Ismid. There are several considerable islands, of which the largest,\r\nMarmora, lies in the west, off the peninsula of Kapu Dagh, along with\r\nAfsia, Aloni and smaller islands. In the east, off the Asiatic shore\r\nbetween the Bosporus and the Gulf of Ismid, are the Princes' Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMOSET, a name derived from Fr. _marmouset_ (meaning \"of a gross\r\nfigure\"), and used to designate the small tropical American monkeys\r\nclassed by naturalists in the family _Hapalidae_ (or _Chrysothricidae_).\r\nMarmosets are not larger than squirrels, and present great variation in\r\ncolour; all have long tails, and many have the ears tufted. They differ\r\nfrom the other American monkeys in having one pair less of molar teeth\r\nin each jaw. The common marmoset, _Hapale_ (or _Chrysothrix_) _jacchus_,\r\nis locally known as the _oustiti_, while the name piriché is applied to\r\nanother species (see PRIMATES).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARMOT, the vernacular name of a large, thickly built, burrowing Alpine\r\nrodent mammal, allied to the squirrels, and typifying the genus\r\n_Arctomys_, of which there are numerous species ranging from the Alps\r\nthrough Asia north of (but including the inner ranges of) the Himalaya,\r\nand recurring in North America. All these may be included under the name\r\nmarmot. In addition to their stout build and long thickly haired tails,\r\nmarmots are characterized by the absence of cheek-pouches, and the\r\nrudimentary first front-toe, which is furnished with a flat nail, as\r\nwell as by certain features of the skull and cheek-teeth. Europe\r\npossesses two species, the Alpine or true marmot (_A. marmotta_), and\r\nthe more eastern bobac (_A. bobac_); and there are numerous kinds in\r\nCentral Asia, one of which, the red marmot (_A. caudata_), is a much\r\nlarger animal, with a longer tail. Marmots inhabit open country, either\r\namong mountains, or, more to the north, in the plains; and associate in\r\nlarge colonies, forming burrows, each tenanted by a single family.\r\nDuring the daytime the hillock at the entrance to the burrow is\r\nfrequently occupied by one or more members of the family, which at the\r\napproach of strangers sit up on their hind-legs in order to get a better\r\nview. If alarmed they utter a shrill loud whistle, and rush down the\r\nburrow, but reappear after a few minutes to see if the danger is past.\r\nIn the winter when the ground is deep in snow, marmots retire to the\r\ndepths of their burrows, where as many as ten or fifteen may occupy the\r\nsame chamber. No store of food is accumulated, and the winter sleep is\r\nprobably unbroken. From two to four is the usual number of young in a\r\nlitter. In America marmots are known as \"wood-chucks\" (q.v.), the\r\ncommonest species being _A. monax_. The so-called prairie-dogs, which\r\nare smaller and more slender North American rodents with small\r\ncheek-pouches, form a separate genus, _Cynomys_; while the term\r\npouched-marmots denotes the various species of souslik (q.v.),\r\n_Spermophilus_ (or _Citillus_), which are common to both hemispheres,\r\nand distinguished by the presence of large cheek-pouches (see RODENTIA).\r\n     (R.

S. by E. of Langres, and uniting with the Seine at Charenton, an\r\neastern suburb of Paris. Leaving Langres on the left the river flows\r\nnorthward, passing Chaumont, as far as a point a little above St Dizier.\r\nHere it turns west and enters the department of Marne, where it waters\r\nthe Perthois and the wide plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse. Soon after its\r\nentrance into this department it receives the Blaise; and turning\r\nnorth-west passes Vitry-le-François where it receives the Saulx,\r\nChâlons, below which it resumes a westerly course, and Epernay, where it\r\nenters picturesque and undulating country. Its subsequent course lies\r\nthrough the departments of Aisne, where it flows through\r\nChateau-Thierry; Seine-et-Marne, where it drives the picturesque mills\r\nof Meaux; Seine-et-Oise and Seine. Its chief tributaries in those\r\ndepartments are the Petit-Morin, the Ourcq and the Grand-Morin. The\r\nlength of the Marne is 328 m., the area of its basin 4894 sq. m. It is\r\njoined a mile from its source of the Marne-Saône canal which is\r\ncontinued at Rouvroy by the Haute-Marne canal as far as\r\nVitry-le-François. From that town, which is the starting-point of the\r\ncanal between the Marne and the Rhine, it is accompanied by the lateral\r\ncanal of the Marne to Dizy where its own channel is canalized. At Condé,\r\nabove Epernay, the river is joined by the canal connecting it with the\r\nAisne. From Lizy, above Meaux, it is accompanied on the right bank,\r\nthough at some distance, by the Ourcq canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNE, a department of north-eastern France, made up from\r\nChampagne-Pouilleuse, Rémois, Haute-Champagne, Perthois, Tardenois,\r\nBocage and Brie-Pouilleuse, districts formerly belonging to Champagne,\r\nand bounded W. by Seine-et-Marne and Aisne, N. by Aisne and Ardennes, E.\r\nby Meuse, and S. by Haute-Marne and Aube. Pop. (1906), 434,157. Area\r\n3167 sq. m.\r\n\r\nAbout one-half consists of Champagne-Pouilleuse, a monotonous and barren\r\nplain covering a bed of chalk 1300 ft. in thickness. On the west and on\r\nthe east it is commanded by two ranges of hills. The highest point in\r\nthe department (920 ft.) is in the hill district of Reims, which rises\r\nto the south-west of the town of the same name, between the Vesle and\r\nthe Marne. The lowest level (164 ft.) where the Aisne leaves the\r\ndepartment, is not far distant. To the south of the Marne the hills of\r\nReims are continued by the heights of Brie (700 to 800 ft.). All these\r\nbelong geologically to the basin of Paris. They slope gently towards the\r\nwest, but command the plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse by a steep descent\r\non the east. On the farther side of the plain are the heights of Argonne\r\n(860 ft.) formed of beds of the Lower Chalk, and covered by forests;\r\nthey unite the calcareous formations of Langres to the schists of\r\nArdennes, and a continuation of them stretches southward into Perthois\r\nand the marshy Bocage. The department belongs entirely to the Seine\r\nbasin, but includes only 13 miles of that river, in the south-west; it\r\nthere receives the Aube, which flows for 10 miles within the department.\r\nThe principal river is the Marne, which runs through the department for\r\n105 miles in a great sweep concave to the south-west. The Aisne enters\r\nthe department at a point 12 miles from its source, and traverses it for\r\n37 miles. Two of its affluents on the left, the Suippes and the Vesle,\r\non which stands Reims, have a longer course from south-east to\r\nnorth-west across the department.\r\n\r\nMarne has the temperate climate of the region of the Seine; the annual\r\nmean temperature is 50° F., the rainfall about 24 in. Oats, wheat, rye\r\nand barley among the cereals, lucerne, sainfoin and clover, and\r\npotatoes, mangold-wurzels and sugar-beet are the principal agricultural\r\ncrops. The raising of sheep of a mixed merino breed and of other stock\r\ntogether with bee-farming are profitable. The vineyards, concentrated\r\nchiefly round Reims and Épernay, are of high value; the manufacture of\r\nthe sparkling Champagne wines being a highly important industry, of\r\nwhich Épernay, Reims and Châlons are the chief centres. Several communes\r\nsupply the more valuable vegetables, such as asparagus, onions, &c. The\r\nprincipal orchard fruits are the apple, plum and cherry. Pine woods are\r\nlargely planted in Champagne-Pouilleuse. The department produces peat,\r\nmillstones and chalk.\r\n\r\nThe woollen industry has brought together in the neighbourhood of Reims\r\nestablishments for spinning, carding, dyeing and weaving. The materials\r\nwrought are flannels, merinoes, tartans, shawls, rugs and fancy\r\narticles; the manufacture of woollen and cotton hosiery must also be\r\nmentioned. The manufacture of wine-cases, corks, casks and other goods\r\nfor the wine trade is actively carried on. Marne contains\r\nblast-furnaces, iron and copper foundries, and manufactories of\r\nagricultural implements. Besides these there are tan-yards, currying and\r\nleather-dressing establishments and glassworks, which, with sugar,\r\nchemical, whiting and oil works, potteries, flour-mills and breweries,\r\ncomplete the list of the most important industries. Biscuits and\r\ngingerbread are a speciality of Reims. The chief imports are wool and\r\ncoal; the exports are wine, grain, live-stock, stone, whiting, pit-props\r\nand woollen stuffs. Communication is afforded chiefly by the river Marne\r\nwith its canal connexions, and by the Eastern railway. There are five\r\narrondissements--those of Châlons (the capital), Épernay, Reims, Ste\r\nMénehould and Vitry-le-François--with 33 cantons and 662 communes. The\r\ndepartment belongs partly to the archbishopric of Reims and partly to\r\nthe see of Châlons. Châlons is the headquarters of the VI. army corps.\r\nIts educational centre and court of appeal are at Paris. The principal\r\ntowns--Châlons-sur-Marne, Reims, Épernay and Vitry-le-François--are\r\nseparately treated. The towns next in population are Ay (4994) and\r\nSézanne (4504). Other places of interest are Ste Ménehould (3348),\r\nformerly an important fortress and capital of the Argonne; Montmort with\r\na Renaissance château once the property of Sully; Trois-Fontaines with a\r\nruined church of the 12th century and the remains of a Cistercian abbey\r\nfounded in 1115; and Orbais with an abbey church dating from about 1200.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARNIAN EPOCH, the name given by G. de Mortillet to the period usually\r\ncalled in France the Gallic, which extends from about five centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era to the conquest of Gaul by Caesar. M. de\r\nMortillet objects to the term \"Gallic,\" as the civilization\r\ncharacteristic of the epoch was not peculiar to the ancient Gauls, but\r\nwas common to nearly all Europe at the same date. The name is derived\r\nfrom the fact that the French department of Marne has afforded the\r\nrichest \"finds.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROCHETTI, CARLO, BARON (1805-1867), Italian sculptor, was born at\r\nTurin. Most of his early life was spent in France, his first systematic\r\ninstruction being given him by Bosio and Gros in Paris. Here his statue\r\nof \"A Young Girl playing with a Dog\" won a medal in 1829. But between\r\n1822 and 1830 he studied chiefly in Rome. From 1832 to 1848 he lived in\r\nFrance. His \"Fallen Angel\" was exhibited in 1831. In 1848 Marochetti\r\nremoved to London, and there he lived for the greater part of his time\r\ntill his death in 1867. Among his chief works were statues of Queen\r\nVictoria, Lord Clyde (the obelisk in Waterloo Place), Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion (Westminster), Emmanuel Philibert (1833, Turin), the tomb\r\nof Bellini (Père-la-Chaise), and the altar in the Madeleine. His style\r\nwas vigorous and effective, but rather popular than artistic.\r\nMarochetti, who was created a baron by the king of Sardinia, was also a\r\nchevalier of the Legion of Honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARONITES (Arab. _Mawarina_), a Christian people of the Ottoman Empire\r\nin communion with the Papal Church, but forming a distinct denomination.\r\nThe original seat and present home of the nucleus of the Maronites is Mt\r\nLebanon; but they are also to be found in considerable force in\r\nAnti-Lebanon and Hermon, and more sporadically in and near Antioch, in\r\nGalilee, and on the Syrian coast. Colonies exist in Cyprus (with a large\r\nconvent near Cape Kormakiti), in Alexandria, and in the United States of\r\nAmerica. These began to be formed during the troubles of 1860. The\r\nLebanon community numbers about 300,000, and the total of the whole\r\ndenomination cannot be much under half a million.\r\n\r\nThe origin of Maronism has been much obscured by the efforts of learned\r\nMaronites like Yusuf as-Simani (Assemanus), Vatican librarian under\r\nClement XII., Faustus Nairon, Gabriel Sionita and Abraham Ecchellensis\r\nto clear its history from all taint of heresy. We are told of an early\r\nAntiochene, Mar Marun or Maro, who died about A.D. 400 in the odour of\r\nsanctity in a convent at Ribla on the Orontes, whence orthodoxy spread\r\nover mid-Syria. But nothing sure is known of him, and not much more\r\nabout a more historical personage, Yuhanna Marun (John Sirimensis of\r\nSuedia), said to have been patriarch of Antioch, to have converted\r\nLebanon from Monothelism, and to have died in A.D. 707. It is, however,\r\ncertain that the Lebanon Christians as a whole were not orthodox in the\r\ntime of Justinian II., against whose supporters, the Melkites, they\r\nranged themselves after having co-operated awhile with the emperor\r\nagainst the Moslems. They were then called Mardaites or rebels, and were\r\nmainly Monothelite in the 12th century, and remained largely so even a\r\ncentury later. The last two facts are attested by William of Tyre and\r\nBarhebraeus. It seems most probable that the Lebanon offered refuge to\r\nAntiochene Monothelites flying from the ban of the Constantinopolitan\r\nCouncil of A.D. 680; that these converted part of the old mountain folk,\r\nwho already held some kind of Incarnationist creed; and that their first\r\npatriarch and his successors, for about 500 years at any rate, were\r\nMonothelite, and perhaps also Monophysite. It is worth noting that even\r\nas late as the close of the 16th century the Maronite patriarch found it\r\nnecessary to protest by anathema against imputations of heresy. In 1182\r\nit is said that Amaury, patriarch of Antioch, induced some Maronite\r\nbishops, who had fallen under crusading influences, to rally to Rome;\r\nand a definite acceptance of the Maronite Church into the Roman\r\ncommunion took place at the Council of Florence in 1445. But it is\r\nevident that the local particularism of the Lebanon was adverse to this\r\nunion, and that even Gregory XIII., who sent the _pallium_ to the\r\npatriarch Michael, and Clement VII. who in 1596 dispatched a mission to\r\na synod convoked at Kannobin, the old patriarchal residence, did not\r\nprevail on the lower clergy or the mass of the Maronites. A century and\r\na half later Clement XII. was more successful. He sent to Syria,\r\nAssemanus, a Maronite educated at the Roman college of Gregory XIII.;\r\nand at last, at a council held at the monastery of Lowaizi on the 30th\r\nof September 1736, the Maronite Church accepted from Rome a constitution\r\nwhich is still in force, and agreed to abandon some of its more\r\nincongruous usages such as mixed convents of monks and nuns. It\r\nretained, however, its Syriac liturgy and a non-celibate priesthood. The\r\nformer still persists unchanged, while the Bible is read and\r\nexhortations are given in Arabic; and priests may still be ordained\r\nafter marriage. But marriage is not permitted subsequent to ordination,\r\nnor does it any longer usually precede it. The tendency to a celibate\r\nclergy increases, together with other romanizing usages, promoted by the\r\npapal legate in Beirut, the Catholic missioners, and the higher native\r\nclergy who are usually educated in Rome or at St Sulpice. The legate\r\nexercises growing influence on patriarchal and other elections, and on\r\nChurch government and discipline. The patriarch receives confirmation\r\nfrom Rome, and the political representation of the Maronites at\r\nConstantinople is in the hands of the vicar apostolic. Rome has\r\nincorporated most of the Maronite saints in her calendar, while refusing\r\n(despite their apologists) to canonize either of the reputed eponymous\r\nfounders of Maronism.\r\n\r\nWhile retaining many local usages, the Maronite Church does not differ\r\nnow in anything essential from the Papal, either in dogma or practice.\r\nIt has, like the Greek Church, two kinds of clergy--parochial and\r\nmonastic. The former are supported by their parishes; the latter by the\r\nrevenues of the monasteries, which own about one-sixth of the Lebanon\r\nlands. There are some 1400 monks in about 120 monastic establishments\r\n(many of these being mere farms in charge of one or two monks). All are\r\nof the order of St Anthony, but divided into three congregations, the\r\nIshaya, the Halebiyeh (Aleppine) and the Beladiyeh or Libnaniyeh\r\n(local). The distinction of the last named dates only from the early\r\n18th century. The lower clergy are educated at the theological college\r\nof Ain Warka. There are five archbishoprics and five bishoprics under\r\nthe patriarch, who alone can consecrate. The sees are Aleppo, Baalbek,\r\nTripoli, Ehden, Damascus, Beirut, Tyre, Cyprus and Jebeil (held by the\r\npatriarch himself _ex officio_). There are also four prelates _in\r\npartibus_.\r\n\r\n  The Maronites are most numerous and unmixed in the north of Lebanon\r\n  (districts of Bsherreh and Kesrawan). Formerly they were wholly\r\n  organized on a clan system under feudal chiefs, of whom those of the\r\n  house of Khazin were the most powerful; and these fought among\r\n  themselves rather than with the Druses or other denominations down to\r\n  the 18th century, when the Arab family of Shehab for its own purposes\r\n  began to stir up strife between Maronites and Druses (see DRUSES).\r\n  Feudalism died hard, but since 1860 has been practically extinct; and\r\n  so far as the Maronites own a chief of their own people it is the\r\n  \"Patriarch of Antioch and the whole East,\" who resides at Bkerkeh near\r\n  Beirut in winter, and at a hill station (Bdiman or Raifun) in summer.\r\n  The latter, however, has no recognized jurisdiction except over his\r\n  clergy. The Maronites have four members on the provincial council, two\r\n  of whom are the sole representatives of the two _mudirats_ of\r\n  Kesrawan; and they have derived benefit from the fact that so far the\r\n  governor of the privileged province has always been a Catholic (see\r\n  LEBANON). The French protection of them, which dates from Louis XIV.,\r\n  is no longer operative but to French official representatives is still\r\n  accorded a courteous precedence. The Maronite population has greatly\r\n  increased at the expense of the Druses, and is now obliged to emigrate\r\n  in considerable numbers. Increase of wealth and the influence of\r\n  returned emigrants tend to soften Maronite character, and the last\r\n  remnants of the barbarous state of the community--even the obstinate\r\n  blood-feud--are disappearing.\r\n\r\n  See C. F. Schnurrer, _De ecclesia Maronitica_ (1810); F. J. Bliss in\r\n  _Pal. Expl. Fund Quarterly Statement_ (1892); and authorities for\r\n  DRUSES and LEBANON.     (D. G. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROONS. A _nègre marron_ is defined by Littré as a fugitive slave who\r\nbetakes himself to the woods; a similar definition of _cimarron_\r\n(apparently from _cima_, a mountain top) is given in the _Dictionary_ of\r\nthe Spanish Academy. The old English form of the word is _symaron_ (see\r\nHawkins's _Voyage_, § 68). The term \"Maroons\" is applied almost as a\r\nproper name to the descendants of those negroes in Jamaica who at the\r\nfirst English occupation in the 17th century fled to the mountains. (See\r\nJAMAICA.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROS-VÁSÁRHELY, a town of Hungary in Transylvania, capital of the\r\ncounty of Maros-Torda, 79 m. E. of Kolozsvár by rail. Pop. (1900),\r\n19,522. It is situated on the left bank of the Maros, and is a\r\nwell-built town; once the capital of the territory of the Szeklers. On a\r\nhill dominating the town stands the old fortress, which contains a\r\nbeautiful church in Gothic style built about 1446, where in 1571 the\r\ndiet was held which proclaimed the equality of the Unitarian Church with\r\nthe Roman Catholic, the Lutheran, and Calvinistic Churches. The Teleki\r\npalace contains the Teleki collections, which include a library of\r\n70,000 volumes and several valuable manuscripts (e.g. the Teleki Codex),\r\na collection of old Hungarian poems, and a manuscript of Tacitus,\r\nbesides a collection of antiquities and another of minerals.\r\nMaros-Vásárhely has also an interesting Szekler industrial museum. The\r\ntrade is chiefly in timber, grain, wine, tobacco, fruit and other\r\nproducts of the neighbourhood. There are manufactures of sugar, spirits\r\nand beer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROT, CLÉMENT (1496-1544), French poet, was born at Cahors, the capital\r\nof the province of Quercy, some time during the winter of the year\r\n1496-1497. His father, Jean Marot (c. 1463-1523), whose more correct\r\nname appears to have been des Mares, Marais or Marets, was a Norman of\r\nthe neighbourhood of Caen. Jean was himself a poet of considerable\r\nmerit, and held the post of _escripvain_ (apparently uniting the duties\r\nof poet laureate and historiographer) to Anne of Brittany. He had\r\nhowever resided in Cahors for a considerable time, and was twice married\r\nthere, his second wife being the mother of Clément. The boy was \"brought\r\ninto France\"--it is his own expression, and is not unnoteworthy as\r\nshowing the strict sense in which that term was still used at the\r\nbeginning of the 16th century--in 1506, and he appears to have been\r\neducated at the university of Paris, and to have then begun the study of\r\nlaw. But, whereas most other poets have had to cultivate poetry against\r\ntheir father's will, Jean Marot took great pains to instruct his son in\r\nthe fashionable forms of verse-making, which indeed required not a\r\nlittle instruction. It was the palmy time of the _rhétoriqueurs_, poets\r\nwho combined stilted and pedantic language with an obstinate adherence\r\nto the allegorical manner of the 15th century and to the most\r\ncomplicated and artificial forms of the _ballade_ and the _rondeau_.\r\nClément himself practised with diligence this poetry (which he was to do\r\nmore than any other man to overthrow), and he has left panegyrics of its\r\ncoryphaeus Guillaume Crétin, the supposed original of the Raminagrobis\r\nof Rabelais, while he translated Virgil's first eclogue in 1512. Nor did\r\nhe long continue even a nominal devotion to law. He became page to\r\nNicolas de Neuville, seigneur de Villeroy, and this opened to him the\r\nway to court life. Besides this, his father's interest must have been\r\nnot inconsiderable, and the house of Valois, which was about to hold the\r\nthrone of France for the greater part of a century, was devoted to\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1514, before the accession of Francis I., Clément presented\r\nto him his _Judgment of Minos_, and shortly afterwards he was either\r\nstyled or styled himself _facteur_ (poet) _de la reine_ to Queen Claude.\r\nIn 1519 he was attached to the suite of Marguerite d'Angoulême, the\r\nking's sister, who was for many years to be the mainstay not only of him\r\nbut of almost all French men of letters. He was also a great favourite\r\nof Francis himself, attended the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and\r\nduly celebrated it in verse. Next year he was at the camp in Flanders,\r\nand writes of the horrors of war. It is certain that Marot, like most of\r\nMarguerite's literary court, and perhaps more than most of them, was\r\ngreatly attracted by her gracious ways, her unfailing kindness, and her\r\nadmirable intellectual accomplishments, but there is not the slightest\r\nground for thinking that his attachment was other than platonic. It is,\r\nhowever, evident that at this time either sentiment or matured critical\r\njudgment effected a great change in his style, a change which was wholly\r\nfor the better. At the same time he celebrates a certain Diane, whom it\r\nhas been sought to identify with Diane de Poitiers. There is nothing to\r\nsupport this idea and much against it, for it was an almost invariable\r\nhabit of the poets of the 16th century, when the mistresses whom they\r\ncelebrated were flesh and blood at all (which was not always the case),\r\nto celebrate them under pseudonyms. In the same year, 1524, Marot\r\naccompanied Francis on his disastrous Italian campaign. He was wounded\r\nand taken at Pavia, but soon released, and he was back again at Paris by\r\nthe beginning of 1525. His luck had, however, turned. Marguerite for\r\nintellectual reasons, and her brother for political, had hitherto\r\nfavoured the double movement of _Aufklärung_, partly humanist, partly\r\nReforming, which distinguished the beginning of the century. Formidable\r\nopposition to both forms of innovation, however, now began to be\r\nmanifested, and Marot, who was at no time particularly prudent, was\r\narrested on a charge of heresy and lodged in the Châtelet, February\r\n1526. But this was only a foretaste of the coming trouble, and a\r\nfriendly prelate, acting for Marguerite, extricated him from his durance\r\nbefore Easter. The imprisonment gave him occasion to write a vigorous\r\npoem on it entitled _Enfer_, which was afterwards imitated by his\r\nluckless friend Étienne Dolet. His father died about this time, and\r\nMarot seems to have been appointed to the place which Jean had latterly\r\nenjoyed, that of valet de chambre to the king. He was certainly a member\r\nof the royal household in 1528 with a stipend of 250 livres, besides\r\nwhich he had inherited property in Quercy. In 1530, probably, he\r\nmarried. Next year he was again in trouble, not it is said for heresy,\r\nbut for attempting to rescue a prisoner, and was again delivered; this\r\ntime the king and queen of Navarre seem to have bailed him themselves.\r\n\r\nIn 1532 he published (it had perhaps appeared three years earlier),\r\nunder the title of _Adolescence Clémentine_, a title the characteristic\r\ngrace of which excuses its slight savour of affectation, the first\r\nprinted collection of his works, which was very popular and was\r\nfrequently reprinted with additions. Dolet's edition of 1538 is believed\r\nto be the most authoritative. Unfortunately, however, the poet's enemies\r\nwere by no means discouraged by their previous ill-success, and the\r\npolitical situation was very unfavourable to the Reforming party. In\r\n1535 Marot was implicated in the affair of \"The Placards,\"[1] and this\r\ntime he was advised or thought it best to fly. He passed through Béarn,\r\nand then made his way to Renée, duchess of Ferrara, a supporter of the\r\nFrench reformers as steadfast as her aunt Marguerite, and even more\r\nefficacious, because her dominions were out of France. At Ferrara he\r\nwrote a good deal, his work there including his celebrated _Blasons_ (a\r\ndescriptive poem, improved upon medieval models[2]), which set all the\r\nverse-writers of France imitating them. But the duchess Renée was not\r\nable to persuade her husband, Ercole d'Este, to share her views, and\r\nMarot had to quit the city. He then went to Venice, but before very long\r\nthe pope Paul III. remonstrated with Francis I. on the severity with\r\nwhich the Protestants were treated, and they were allowed to return to\r\nParis on condition of recanting their errors. Marot returned with the\r\nrest, and abjured his heresy at Lyons. In 1539 Francis gave him a house\r\nand grounds in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that his famous translations of the Psalms appeared.\r\nThe merit of these has been sometimes denied, it is, however,\r\nconsiderable, and the powerful influence which the book exercised on\r\ncontemporaries is not denied by anyone. The great persons of the court\r\nchose different pieces, each as his or her favourite. They were sung in\r\ncourt and city, and they are said, with exaggeration doubtless, but\r\nstill with a basis of truth, to have done more than anything else to\r\nadvance the cause of the Reformation in France. Indeed, the vernacular\r\nprose translations of the Scriptures were in that country of little\r\nmerit or power, and the form of poetry was still preferred to prose,\r\neven for the most incongruous subjects. At the same time Marot engaged\r\nin a curious literary quarrel characteristic of the time, with a bad\r\npoet named Sagon, who represented the reactionary Sorbonne. Half the\r\nverse-writers of France ranged themselves among the Marotiques or the\r\nSagontiques, and a great deal of versified abuse was exchanged. The\r\nvictory, as far as wit was concerned, naturally rested with Marot, but\r\nhis biographers are probably not fanciful in supposing that a certain\r\namount of odium was created against him by the squabble, and that, as in\r\nDolet's case, his subsequent misfortunes were not altogether unconnected\r\nwith a too little governed tongue and pen.\r\n\r\nThe publication of the Psalms gave the Sorbonne a handle, and the book\r\nwas condemned by that body. In 1543 it was evident that he could not\r\nrely on the protection of Francis. Marot accordingly fled to Geneva; but\r\nthe stars were now decidedly against him. He had, like most of his\r\nfriends, been at least as much of a freethinker as of a Protestant, and\r\nthis was fatal to his reputation in the austere city of Calvin. He had\r\nagain to fly, and made his way into Piedmont, and he died at Turin in\r\nthe autumn of 1544.\r\n\r\n  In character Marot seems to have been a typical Frenchman of the old\r\n  stamp, cheerful, good-humoured and amiable enough, but probably not\r\n  very much disposed to elaborately moral life and conversation or to\r\n  serious reflection. He has sometimes been charged with a want of\r\n  independence of character; but it is fair to remember that in the\r\n  middle ages men of letters naturally attached themselves as dependants\r\n  to the great. Such scanty knowledge as we have of his relations with\r\n  his equals is favourable to him. He certainly at one time quarrelled\r\n  with Dolet, or at least wrote a violent epigram against him, for which\r\n  there is no known cause. But, as Dolet quarrelled with almost every\r\n  friend he ever had, and in two or three cases played them the\r\n  shabbiest of tricks, the presumption is not against Marot in this\r\n  matter. With other poets like Mellin de Saint Gelais and Brodeau, with\r\n  prose writers like Rabelais and Bonaventure Desperiers, he was always\r\n  on excellent terms. And whatever may have been his personal\r\n  weaknesses, his importance in the history of French literature is very\r\n  great, and was long rather under than over-valued. Coming immediately\r\n  before a great literary reform--that of the Pléiade--Marot suffered\r\n  the drawbacks of his position; he was both eclipsed and decried by the\r\n  partakers in that reform. In the reaction against the Pléiade he\r\n  recovered honour; but its restoration to virtual favour, a perfectly\r\n  just restoration, again unjustly depressed him. Yet Marot is in no\r\n  sense one of those writers of transition who are rightly obscured by\r\n  those who come after them. He himself was a reformer, and a reformer\r\n  on perfectly independent lines, and he carried his own reform as far\r\n  as it would go. His early work was couched in the _rhétoriqueur_\r\n  style, the distinguishing characteristics of which are elaborate metre\r\n  and rhyme, allegoric matter and pedantic language. In his second stage\r\n  he entirely emancipated himself from this, and became one of the\r\n  easiest, least affected and most vernacular poets of France. In these\r\n  points indeed he has, with the exception of La Fontaine, no rival, and\r\n  the lighter verse-writers ever since have taken one or the other or\r\n  both as model. In his third period he lost a little of this flowing\r\n  grace and ease, but acquired something in stateliness, while he\r\n  certainly lost nothing in wit. Marot is the first poet who strikes\r\n  readers of French as being distinctively modern. He is not so great a\r\n  poet as Villon nor as some of his successors of the Pléiade, but he is\r\n  much less antiquated than the first (whose works, as well as the\r\n  _Roman de la rose_, it may be well to mention that he edited) and not\r\n  so elaborately artificial as the second. Indeed if there be a fault to\r\n  find with Marot, it is undoubtedly that in his gallant and successful\r\n  effort to break up, supple, and liquefy the stiff forms and stiffer\r\n  language of the 15th century, he made his poetry almost too vernacular\r\n  and pedestrian. He _has_ passion, and picturesqueness, but rarely; in\r\n  his hands, and while the _style Marotique_ was supreme, French poetry\r\n  ran some risk of finding itself unequal to anything but graceful _vers\r\n  de société_. But it is only fair to remember that for a century and\r\n  more its best achievements, with rare exceptions, had been _vers de\r\n  société_ which were not graceful.\r\n\r\n  The most important early editions of Marot's _Oeuvres_ are those\r\n  published at Lyons in 1538 and 1544. In the second of these the\r\n  arrangement of his poems which has been accepted in later issues was\r\n  first adopted. In 1596 an enlarged edition was edited by François\r\n  Mizière. Others of later date are those of N. Lenglet du Fresnoy (the\r\n  Hague, 1731) and P. Jannet (1868-1872; new ed., 1873-1876), on the\r\n  whole the best, but there is a very good selection with a still better\r\n  introduction by Charles d'Héricault, the joint editor of the Jannet\r\n  edition in the larger _Collection Garnier_ (no date). An elaborate\r\n  edition by G. Guiffrey remained incomplete, only vols. ii. and iii.\r\n  (1875-1881) having been issued. For information about Marot himself\r\n  see _Notices biographiques des trois Marot_, edited from the MS. of\r\n  Guillaume Colletet by G. Guiffrey (1871); H. Morley, _Clément Marot_,\r\n  a study of Marot as a reformer; O. Douen, _Clément Marot et le\r\n  psautier huguenot_; the section concerning him in G.

Sa.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] These \"placards\" were the work of the extreme Protestants. Pasted\r\n    up in the principal streets of Paris on the night of the 17th of\r\n    October 1534, they vilified the Mass and its celebrants, and thus led\r\n    to a renewal of the religious persecution.\r\n\r\n  [2] The _blason_ was defined by Thomas Sibilet as a perpetual praise\r\n    or continuous vituperation of its subject. The _blasons_ of Marot's\r\n    followers were printed in 1543 with the title of _Blasons anatomiques\r\n    du corps féminin_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROT, DANIEL (seventeenth century), French architect, furniture\r\ndesigner and engraver, and pupil of Jean le Pautre (q.v.), was the son\r\nof Jean Marot (1620-1679), who was also an architect and engraver. He\r\nwas a Huguenot, and was compelled by the Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes in 1685 to settle in Holland. His earlier work is characteristic\r\nof the second period of Louis XIV., but eventually it became tinged with\r\nDutch influence, and in the end the English style which is loosely\r\ncalled \"Queen Anne\" owed much to his manner. In Holland he was taken\r\nalmost immediately into the service of the Stadtholder, who, when he\r\nshortly afterwards became William III. of England, appointed him one of\r\nhis architects and master of the works. Comparatively little is known of\r\nhis architectural achievements, and his name cannot be attached to any\r\nEnglish building, although we know from his own engraving that he\r\ndesigned the great hall of audience for the States-General at the Hague.\r\nHe also decorated many Dutch country-houses. In England his activities\r\nappear to have been concentrated upon the adornment of Hampton Court\r\nPalace. Among his plans for gardens is one inscribed: \"Parterre\r\nd'Amton-court inventé par D. Marot.\" Much of the furniture--especially\r\nthe mirrors, guéridons and beds--at Hampton Court bears unmistakable\r\ntraces of his authorship; the tall and monumental beds, with their\r\nplumes of ostrich feathers, their elaborate valances and _chantournes_\r\nin crimson velvet or other rich stuffs agree very closely with his\r\npublished designs. As befits an artist of the time of Louis XIV.\r\nsplendour and elaboration are the outstanding characteristics of Marot's\r\nstyle, and he appears even to have been responsible for some of the\r\ncurious and rather barbaric silver furniture which was introduced into\r\nEngland from France in the latter part of the 17th century. At Windsor\r\nCastle there is a silver table, attributed to him, supported by caryatid\r\nlegs and gadrooned feet, with a foot-rail supporting the pine-apple\r\nwhich is so familiar a motive in work of this type. The slab is engraved\r\nwith the arms of William III. and with the British national emblems with\r\ncrowns and cherubs. Unquestionably it is an exceedingly fine example of\r\nits type. During his life in France Marot made many designs for André\r\nCharles Boulle (q.v.), more especially for long case and bracket clocks.\r\nThe bracket clocks were intended to be mounted in chased and gilded\r\nbronze, and with their garlands and masquerons and elegant dials are far\r\nsuperior artistically to those of the \"grandfather\" variety. It is\r\nimpossible to examine the designs for Marot's long clocks without\r\nsuspecting that Chippendale derived from them some at least of the\r\ninspiration which made him a master of that kind of furniture. Marot's\r\nrange was extraordinarily wide. He designed practically every detail in\r\nthe internal ornamentation of the house--carved chimney-pieces,\r\nceilings, panels for walls, girandoles and wall brackets, and even tea\r\nurns and cream jugs--he was indeed a prolific designer of gold and\r\nsilver plate. Many of his interiors are very rich and harmonious\r\nalthough commonly over-elaborated. The craze for collecting china which\r\nwas at its height in his time is illustrated in his lavish designs for\r\nreceptacles for porcelain--in one of his plates there are more than 300\r\npieces of china on the chimney-piece alone. Marot was still living in\r\n1718, and the date of his death is unknown.\r\n\r\n  We owe much of our knowledge of his work to the volume of his designs\r\n  published at Amsterdam in 1712: _Oeuvres du Sieur D. Marot, architecte\r\n  de Guillaume III. Roi de la Grande Bretagne_, and to _Receuil des\r\n  planches des sieurs Marot, père et fils_. In addition to decorative\r\n  work these books contain prints of scenes in Dutch history, and\r\n  engravings of the statues and vases, produced by Marot, at the Palace\r\n  of Loo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARPLE, an urban district in the Hyde parliamentary division of\r\nCheshire, England, 12 m. S.E. of Manchester, served by the Great\r\nCentral, Midland & Sheffield and Midland railways, and the Cheshire\r\nlines. Pop. (1901), 5595. It lies on and above the valley of the Goyt,\r\nand its situation has brought the town into favour as a residential\r\ncentre for those whose business lies in Manchester, Stockport, and the\r\ngreat manufacturing district to the west. Marple Hall, a beautiful\r\nElizabethan mansion, is connected with the youth, and sometimes stated\r\nto be the birthplace, of John Bradshaw the regicide (1602-1659).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARPRELATE CONTROVERSY, a war of pamphlets waged in 1588 and 1589\r\nbetween a puritan writer who employed the pseudonym \"Martin Marprelate\"\r\nand defenders of the Established Church. Martin's tracts are\r\ncharacterized by violent and personal invective against the Anglican\r\ndignitaries, by the assumption that the writer had numerous and powerful\r\nadherents and was able to enforce his demands for reform, and by a plain\r\nand homely style combined with pungent wit. While he maintained the\r\npuritan doctrines as a whole, the special point of his attack was the\r\nEpiscopacy. The pamphlets were printed at a secret press established by\r\nJohn Penry, a Welsh puritan, with the help of the printer Robert\r\nWaldegrave, about midsummer 1588, for the issue of puritan literature\r\nforbidden by the authorities. The first tract by \"Martin Marprelate,\"\r\nknown as the _Epistle_, appeared at Molesey in November 1588. It is in\r\nanswer to _A Defence of the Government established in the Church of\r\nEnglande_, by Dr. John Bridges, dean of Salisbury, itself a reply to\r\nearlier puritan works, and besides attacking the episcopal office in\r\ngeneral assails certain prelates with much personal abuse. The _Epistle_\r\nattracted considerable notice, and a reply was written by Thomas Cooper,\r\nbishop of Winchester, under the title _An Admonition to the People of\r\nEngland_, but this was too long and too dull to appeal to the same class\r\nof readers as the Marprelate pamphlets, and produced little effect.\r\nPenry's press, now removed to Fawsley, near Northampton, produced a\r\nsecond tract by Martin, the _Epitome_, which contains more serious\r\nargument than the _Epistle_ but is otherwise similar, and shortly\r\nafterwards, at Coventry, Martin's reply to the _Admonition_, entitled\r\n_Hay any Worke for Cooper_ (March 1589). It now appeared to some of the\r\necclesiastical authorities that the only way to silence Martin was to\r\nhave him attacked in his own railing style, and accordingly certain\r\nwriters of ready wit, among them John Lyly, Thomas Nashe and Robert\r\nGreene, were secretly commissioned to answer the pamphlets. Among the\r\nproductions of this group were _Pappe with an Hatchet_ (Sept. 1589),\r\nprobably by Lyly, and _An Almond for a Parrat_ (1590), which, with\r\ncertain tracts under the pseudonym of Pasquil, has been attributed to\r\nNashe (q.v.). Some anti-Martinist plays or shows (now lost) performed in\r\n1589 were perhaps also their work. Meanwhile, in July 1589, Penry's\r\npress, now at Wolston, near Coventry, produced two tracts purporting to\r\nbe by \"sons\" of Martin, but probably by Martin himself, namely, _Theses\r\nMartinianae_ by Martin Junior, and _The Just Censure of Martin Junior_\r\nby Martin Senior. Shortly after this, _More Work for Cooper_, a sequel\r\nto _Hay any Worke_, was begun at Manchester, but while it was in\r\nprogress the press was seized. Penry however was not found, and in\r\nSeptember issued from Wolston or Haseley _The Protestation of Martin\r\nMarprelate_, the last work of the series, though several of the\r\nanti-Martinist pamphlets appeared after this date. He then fled to\r\nScotland, but was later apprehended in London, charged with inciting\r\nrebellion, and hanged (May 1593). The authorship of the tracts has been\r\nattributed to several persons: to Penry himself, who however\r\nemphatically denied it and whose acknowledged works have little\r\nresemblance in style to those of Martin, to Job Throckmorton, and to\r\nHenry Barrow.\r\n\r\n  See, for list and full titles of the tracts, related documents, and\r\n  discussion of the authorship, E. Arber's _Introductory Sketch to the\r\n  Martin Marprelate Controversy_ (1880), which, however, gives no\r\n  connected account of the matter. A good summary, with quotations from\r\n  the pamphlets, will be found in H. M. Dexter's _Congregationalism_\r\n  (New York, 1880), pp. 129-202. See also articles on John Penry and Job\r\n  Throckmorton in _Dict. of Nat. Biography_; and for the history of the\r\n  press, _Bibliographica_, ii. 172-180. Maskell's _Martin Marprelate\r\n  Controversy_ (1845) is of little service. The more important tracts\r\n  have been reprinted by Petheram in his series of _Puritan Discipline\r\n  Tracts_ (1842-1860), in Arber's _English Scholar's Library_\r\n  (1879-1880), in R. W. Bond's edition of Lyly and in the editions of\r\n  Nashe.     (R. B. McK.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUAND, HENRY GURDON (1819-1902), American philanthropist and\r\ncollector, was born in New York City on the 11th of April 1819. In 1839,\r\nupon the retirement from the jewelry business of his brother Frederick\r\n(1799-1882), who was a liberal benefactor of Yale College and of the\r\nUnion Theological Seminary, he became his brother's agent. He was one of\r\nthe purchasers in 1868 of the Iron Mountain railroad, afterwards its\r\npresident, and a director of the Missouri-Pacific system. He was the\r\nfirst honorary member of the American Institute of Architects, and\r\npresident (1889-1902) of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to which he\r\nmade valuable presents and loans from his collection of paintings. He\r\ndied in New York City, on the 26th of February 1902. His varied and\r\nvaluable art collection and rare books were sold in 1903. He was a\r\nbenefactor of Princeton University and other institutions. His son,\r\nALLAN MARQUAND (b. 1853), graduated at Princeton in 1874, and in 1883\r\nbecame professor of archaeology and art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUARDT, JOACHIM (1812-1882), German historian and writer on Roman\r\nantiquities, was born at Danzig on the 19th of April 1812. He studied at\r\nBerlin and Leipzig, held various educational appointments from 1833\r\nonwards at Berlin, Danzig and Posen, and became in 1859 head of the\r\ngymnasium in Gotha, where he died on the 30th of November 1882. The\r\ndedication of his treatise _Historiae equitum romanorum libri quatuor_\r\n(1841) to Lachmann led to his being recommended to the publisher of W.\r\nA. Becker's _Handbuch der römischen Alterthümer_ to continue the work on\r\nthe death of the author in 1846. It took twenty years to complete, and\r\nmet with such success that a new edition was soon called for. Finding\r\nhimself unequal to the task single-handed, Marquardt left the\r\npreparation of the first three volumes (_Römisches Staatsrecht_) to\r\nTheodor Mommsen, while he himself contributed vols. iv.-vi. (_Römische\r\nStaatsverwaltung_, 1873-1878; 2nd ed., 1881-1885, vol. v. by H. Dessau\r\nand A. von Domaszewski, vol. vi. by G. Wissowa) and vol. vii. (_Das\r\nPrivatleben der Römer_, 1879-1882; 2nd ed., by A. Mau, 1886). Its\r\nclearness of style, systematic arrangement and abundant references to\r\nauthorities ancient and modern, will always render it valuable to the\r\nstudent.\r\n\r\n  See E. Förstemann in _Allgemeine deutsche Biographie_, Bd. XX; R.\r\n  Ehwald, _Gedächtnisrede_ (progr. Gotha, 1883).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUESAS or MENDAÑA ISLANDS (Fr. _Les Marquises_), an archipelago of\r\nthe Pacific Ocean lying between 7° 50´ and 10° 35´ S. and 138° 50´ and\r\n140° 50´ W., and belonging to France. It extends over 250 m. from S.E.\r\nto N.W., and has a total area of 490 sq. m. The southern or Mendaña\r\ngroup consists of the islands Fatuhiva or Magdalena, Motane or San\r\nPedro, Tahuata or Santa Christina and Hivaoa or Dominica, the last with\r\na coast-line of more than 60 m. With these is often included the rocky\r\nislet of Fatuhuku or Hood, lying in mid-channel to the north of Hivaoa.\r\nThe north-western or Washington group is formed of seven islands, the\r\nfour largest being Huapu or Adams, Huahuna or Washington, Nukuhiva (70\r\nm. in circumference) and Eiao.[1] Along the centre of each island is a\r\nridge of mountains, attaining an altitude of 4042 ft in Huapu, whence\r\nrugged spurs forming deep valleys stretch towards the sea. The volcanic\r\norigin of the whole archipelago is proved by the principal rocks being\r\nof basalt, trachyte and lava. Vegetation is luxuriant in the valleys,\r\nwhich are well watered with streams and, from their seaward termination\r\nin small bays, are themselves known as \"bays.\" The flora includes about\r\nfour hundred known species, many of them identical with those belonging\r\nto the Society Islands. The vegetable products comprise bananas,\r\nbreadfruit, yams, plantains, wild cotton, bamboos, sugarcane, coconut\r\nand dwarf palms, and several kinds of timber trees. The land fauna\r\nhowever is very poor; there are few mammals with the exception of dogs,\r\nrats and pigs; and amphibia and insects are also generally scarce. Of\r\ntwenty species of birds more than half belong to the sea, where animal\r\nlife is as abundant as about other sub-tropical Polynesian groups. The\r\nclimate, although hot and damp, is not unhealthy. During the greater\r\npart of the year moderate easterly trade-winds prevail, and at the\r\nlarger islands there are often both land and sea breezes. The rainy\r\nseason accompanied by variable winds sets in at the end of November, and\r\nlasts for about six months. During this period the thermometer varies\r\nfrom 84° to 91° F.; in the dry season its average range is from 77° to\r\n86°. The archipelago, which has some small trade in copra, cotton and\r\ncotton seeds, is administered by a French resident, and has a total\r\npopulation of about 4300, nearly all natives.\r\n\r\nThe natives, a pure Polynesian race, are usually described as physically\r\nthe finest of all South Sea Islanders. Their traditions point to Samoa\r\nas the colonizing centre from which they sprang. Their complexion is a\r\nhealthy bronze. Until the introduction of civilization they were\r\nremarkable for their elaborate tattooing. Their cannibalism seems to\r\nhave been dictated by taste, for it was never associated with their\r\nreligion, the sacrifices to their gods being always swine. Of these and\r\nfowls they rear a great quantity. Their native drink is _kava_. Their\r\nhouses are unlike those usual in Polynesia in being built on platforms\r\nraised from the ground. In disposition the islanders are friendly and\r\nhospitable, brave and somewhat bloodthirsty; and, although naturally\r\nindolent and morose, they have proved industrious and keen traders. As\r\namong their kinsfolk the Tahitians, debauchery was systematized and\r\ninfanticide an organized institution. A population which at the time of\r\nthe annexation by France (1842) was 20,000 has been reduced to little\r\nover 4000. Latterly the natives have for the most part outwardly adopted\r\nChristianity.\r\n\r\n  The Marquesas Islands were discovered on the 21st of July 1595 by\r\n  Alvaro Mendaña, who, however, only knew of the south-eastern group, to\r\n  which he gave the name by which they are generally known (although\r\n  they also bear his own), in honour of Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza,\r\n  marquis of Cañete, viceroy of Peru, and patron of the voyage. Captain\r\n  Cook pursuing the same track rediscovered this group, with the\r\n  addition of Fatuhuku, in 1774. The north-western islands were first\r\n  sighted by the American Captain Ingraham in 1791, and given the name\r\n  of Washington by him; the French Captain Marchand followed in the same\r\n  year, and Lieut. Hergest in 1792. The Russian explorer, Adam Ivan\r\n  Krusenstern, made an extensive investigation of the archipelago in\r\n  1804. In 1813 the American Commodore David Porter failed to establish\r\n  a colony here; and in May 1842, after French Roman Catholic\r\n  missionaries had prepared the way, Rear-admiral Dupetit-Thouars took\r\n  formal possession of the archipelago for France. A complete settlement\r\n  was not effected without bloodshed and about 1860-1870 the colony was\r\n  practically abandoned.\r\n\r\n  See Vincendon-Dumoulin _Îles Marquises_ (Paris, 1843); E. Jardin,\r\n  _Essai sur l'histoire naturelle de l'archipel de Mendaña_ (Paris,\r\n  1860); Clavel, _Les Marquisiens_ (Paris, 1885); Dordillon, _Grammaire\r\n  et dictionnaire de la langue des Îles Marquises_ (Paris, 1904).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n  [1] Most of the islands have each three or four alternative names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUESS, or MARQUIS (Fr. _marquis_, Ital. _marchese_; from med. Lat.\r\n_marchio_, _marchisus_, i.e. _comes marchiae_, \"count of the March\"), a\r\ntitle and rank of nobility. In the British peerage it is the second in\r\norder and therefore next to duke. In this sense the word was a\r\nreintroduction from abroad; but lords of the Welsh and Scottish\r\n\"marches\" are occasionally termed _marchiones_ from an early date. The\r\nfirst marquess in England was Robert de Vere, the 9th earl of Oxford,\r\nwho was created marquess of Dublin by Richard II. on the 1st of December\r\n1385 and assigned precedence between dukes and earls. On the 13th of\r\nOctober following the patent of this marquessate was recalled, Robert de\r\nVere then having been raised to a dukedom. John de Beaufort, earl of\r\nSomerset, the second legitimate son of John of Gaunt, was raised to the\r\nsecond marquessate as marquess of Dorset on the 29th of September 1397,\r\nbut degraded again to earl in 1399. The Commons petitioned for the\r\nrestoration of his marquessate in 1402, but he himself objected because\r\n\"le noun de Marquys feust estraunge noun en cest Roialme.\" From that\r\nperiod this title appears to have been dormant till the reign of Henry\r\nVI., when it was revived (1442), and thenceforward it maintained its\r\nplace in the British peerage. Anne Boleyn was created marchioness of\r\nPembroke in 1532. A marquess is \"most honourable,\" and is styled \"my\r\nlord marquess.\" His wife, who is also \"most honourable,\" is a\r\nmarchioness, and is styled \"my lady marchioness.\" The coronet is a\r\ncirclet of gold on which rest four leaves and as many large pearls, all\r\nof them of equal height and connected. The cap and lining, if worn, are\r\nthe same as in the other coronets (see CROWN and CORONET). The mantle of\r\nparliament is scarlet, and has three and a half doublings of ermine.\r\n\r\nIn France, so early as the 9th century, counts who held several counties\r\nand had succeeded in making themselves quasi-independent began to\r\ndescribe themselves as _marchiones_, this use of the word being due to\r\nthe fact that originally none but the margraves, or counts of the\r\nmarches, had been allowed to hold more than one county. The _marchio_ or\r\nmarquess thus came to be no more than a count of exceptional power and\r\ndignity, the original significance of the title being lost. In course of\r\ntime the title was recognized as ranking between those of duke and\r\ncount; but with the decay of feudalism it lost much of its dignity, and\r\nby the 17th century the savour of pretentiousness attached to it had\r\nmade it a favourite subject of satire for Molière and other dramatists\r\nof the classical comedy. Abolished at the Revolution, the title of\r\nmarquess was not restored by Napoleon, but it was again revived by Louis\r\nXVIII., who created many of Napoleon's counts marquesses. This again\r\ntended to cheapen the title, a process hastened under the republic by\r\nits frequent assumption on very slender grounds in the absence of any\r\nauthority to prevent its abuse. In Italy too the title of _marchese_,\r\nonce borne only by the powerful margraves of Verona, has shared the fate\r\nof most other titles of nobility in becoming common and of no great\r\nsocial significance. (See also MARGRAVE.)     (J. H. R.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUETRY (Fr. _marqueterie_, from _marqueter_, to inlay, literally to\r\nmark, _marquer_), an inlay of ornamental woods, ivory, bone, brass and\r\nother metals, tortoise-shell, mother-of-pearl, &c., in which shaped\r\npieces of different materials or tints are combined to form a design. It\r\nis a later development of the ornamental inlays of wood known by the\r\nname of Intarsia, and though in the main the latter was a true inlay of\r\none or more colours upon a darker or lighter ground, while marquetry is\r\ncomposed of pieces of quite thin wood or other material of equal\r\nthickness laid down upon a matrix with glue, there are examples of\r\nIntarsia in which this mode of manufacture was evidently followed. For\r\ninstance, the backs of the stalls in the cathedral of Ferrara show the\r\nperspective lines of some of the subjects traced upon the ground where\r\nthe marquetry has fallen off, but none of the sinkings in the surface\r\nwhich would be there if the panels had been executed as true inlays. In\r\nthe endeavour to gain greater relief, shading and tinting the wood were\r\nresorted to, the shading being generally produced by scorching, either\r\nwith a hot iron or hot sand, and the tinting by chemical washes and even\r\nby the use of actual colour, but the result is usually hardly\r\ncommensurate with the labour expended. A combination of tortoise-shell\r\nand metal, the one forming the ground and the other the pattern upon it,\r\nwhich may be classed as marquetry also appears in the 17th century. The\r\nsubjects of the _intarsiatori_ are generally arabesques or panels with\r\nelaborate perspectives, either of buildings or cupboards with different\r\narticles upon the shelves seen through half-open doors, which themselves\r\nare frequently of lattice-work delineated with extraordinary perfection,\r\nthough figure subjects occur also. The later _marqueteurs_ used a freer\r\nform of design for the most part, and scrolls and bunches of flowers\r\nappear in profusion, while if architectural forms occur they are\r\ngenerally in the shape of ruins amid landscape. The greater portion of\r\nthe examples in England are importations, either from Holland (in which\r\ncountry very fine work was produced during the latter half of the 16th\r\nand 17th centuries) or from France. The reputation of the Dutch\r\n_marqueteurs_ was so great that Colbert engaged two, named Pierre Gole\r\nand Vordt, for the Gobelins at the beginning of the 17th century. Jean\r\nMacé of Blois, the first Frenchman known to have practised the art, who\r\nwas at work in Paris from 1644 (when he was lodged in the Louvre), or\r\nearlier, till 1672, as a sculptor and painter, learnt it in the\r\nNetherlands. His title was \"menuisier et faiseur de cabinets et tableaux\r\nen marqueterie de bois\"; but as early as 1576 a certain Hans Kraus had\r\nbeen called \"marqueteur du roi.\" Jean Macé's daughter married Pierre\r\nBoulle, and the greatest of the family, André Charles Boulle (q.v.),\r\nsucceeded to his lodging in the Louvre on his death in 1672. The members\r\nof this family are perhaps the best known of the French _marqueteurs_.\r\nTheir greatest triumphs were gained in the marquetry of metal and\r\ntortoise-shell combined with beautifully chiselled ormulu mountings; but\r\nmany foreign workmen found employment in France from the time of\r\nColbert, and some of them rose to the highest eminence. The names of\r\nRoentgen, under whom the later German marquetry perhaps reached its\r\nhighest point, Riesener and Oeben, testify to their nationality. A good\r\ndeal of marquetry was executed in England in the later Stuart period,\r\nmainly upon long-case clocks, cabinets and chests of drawers, and it is\r\noften of real excellence. Marquetry in a shallower form was also\r\nextensively used in the latter part of the 18th century. The most\r\nbeautiful examples of the art in Italy are mainly panels of choir stalls\r\nor sacristy cupboards, though marriage coffers were also often\r\nsumptuously decorated in this manner. With the increase in luxury and\r\ndisplay in the 17th and 18th centuries in France and Germany cabinets\r\nand escritoires became objects upon which extraordinary talent and\r\nexpenditure were lavished. In South Germany musical instruments, weapons\r\nand bride chests were often lavishly decorated with marquetry. The\r\ncabinets are of elaborate architectural design with inlays of ebony and\r\nivory or with veneers of black and white, the design counterchanging so\r\nthat one cutting produced several repeats of the same pattern in one\r\ncolour or the other. In modern practice as many as four or even six\r\nthicknesses are put together and so cut. When all the parts have been\r\ncut and fitted together face downwards paper is glued over them to keep\r\nthem in place and the ground and the veneer are carefully levelled and\r\ntoothed so as to obtain a freshly worked surface. The ground is then\r\nwell wetted with glue at a high temperature and the surfaces squeezed\r\ntightly together between frames called \"cauls\" till the glue is hard.\r\nThere are several modes of ensuring the accurate fitting of the various\r\nparts, which is a matter of the first importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUETTE, JACQUES (1637-1675), French Jesuit missionary and explorer,\r\nre-discoverer (with Louis Joliet) of the Mississippi. He was born at\r\nLaon, went to Canada in 1666, and was sent in 1668 to the upper lakes of\r\nthe St Lawrence. Here he worked at Sault Ste Marie, St Esprit (near the\r\nwestern extremity of Lake Superior) and St Ignace (near Michilimackinac\r\nor Mackinaw, on the strait between Huron and Michigan). In 1673 he was\r\nchosen with Joliet for the exploration of the Mississippi, of which the\r\nFrench had begun to gain knowledge from Indians of the central prairies.\r\nThe route taken lay up the north-west side of Lake Michigan, up Green\r\nBay and Fox river, across Lake Winnebago, over the portage to the\r\nWisconsin river, and down the latter into the Mississippi, which was\r\ndescended to within 700 m. of the sea, at the confluence of the Arkansas\r\nriver. Entering the Mississippi on the 17th of May, Joliet and his\r\ncompanion turned back on the 17th of July, and returned to Green Bay and\r\nMichigan (by way of the Illinois river) at the end of September 1673. On\r\nthe journey Marquette fell ill of dysentery; and a fresh excursion which\r\nhe undertook to plant a mission among the Indians of the Illinois river\r\nin the winter of 1674-1675 proved fatal. He died on his way home to St\r\nIgnace on the banks of a small stream (the lesser and older Marquette\r\nRiver) which enters the east side of Lake Michigan in Marquette Bay (May\r\n18, 1675). His name is now borne by a larger watercourse which flows\r\nsome distance from the scene of his death.\r\n\r\n  See Marquette's _Journal_, first published in Melchissédech Thévenot's\r\n  _Recueil de Voyages_ (Paris, 1681), and fully given in Martin's\r\n  _Relations inédites_, and in Shea's _Discovery and Exploration of the\r\n  Mississippi Valley_ (New York, 1852); cf. also Pierre Margry's\r\n  _Découvertes ... des Français dans l'ouest et dans le sud de\r\n  l'Amérique septentrionale_ (1614-1754); _Mémoires et documents\r\n  originaux_ (Paris, 1875), containing Joliet's _Détails_ and\r\n  _Relations_; Francis Parkman, _La Salle and the Discovery of the Great\r\n  West_ (Boston 1869-1878), esp. pp. x., 20, 32-33, 49-72.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARQUETTE, a city, a port of entry and the county seat of Marquette\r\ncounty, Michigan U.S.A., on the south shore of Lake Superior. Pop.\r\n(1900), 10,058 (3460 foreign-born); (1910), 11,503. It is served by the\r\nDuluth, South Shore & Atlantic, the Marquette & South-Eastern, the\r\nChicago, Milwaukee & St Paul, the Chicago & North-Western, and the Lake\r\nSuperior & Ishpeming railways. The city, which is situated on a bluff 100\r\nft. above the lake, in a region characterized by rounded hills and\r\npicturesque irregularities, has a delightful climate, and is a popular\r\nsummer resort. Presque Isle park (400 acres), a headland north of the\r\ncity, is one of its principal attractions. Marquette is the seat of the\r\nNorthern State Normal School (established 1899) and of the state house of\r\ncorrection and branch prison (established 1885). A county-court-house,\r\nthe Peter White library, and the Federal building are the most prominent\r\npublic buildings. Marquette is the seat of Roman Catholic and Protestant\r\nEpiscopal bishoprics. The city is best known as a shipping centre of one\r\nof the richest iron-ore districts in the world, and its large and\r\nwell-equipped ore docks are among its most prominent features. Marquette\r\nis the port of entry of the customs district of Superior. In 1896 its\r\nimports were valued at $358,505 and its exports at $4,708,302; in 1908,\r\nimports $1,845,724 and exports $7,040,473. Foundries, railway\r\nmachine-shops, lumber and planing-mills, brewery and bottling works, and\r\nquarries of brownish-red sandstone contribute largely to the city's\r\neconomic importance. The charcoal iron blast-furnaces of the city\r\nmanufacture pig-iron, and, as by-products, wood alcohol and acetic acid,\r\nrecovered from the smoke of the charcoal pits. The value of the city's\r\nfactory products increased from $1,585,083 in 1900 to $2,364,081 in 1905,\r\nor 49.1%. The first settlement was made about 1845, and in 1849 it was\r\nnamed Worcester; but \"Marquette\" was soon substituted in honour of\r\nJacques Marquette. It was incorporated as a village in 1859, and\r\nchartered as a city in 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARR, CARL (1858-   ), American artist, was born at Milwaukee, Wisconsin,\r\non the 14th of February 1858, the son of an engraver. He was a pupil of\r\nHenry Vianden in Milwaukee, of Schauss in Weimar, of Gussow in Berlin,\r\nand subsequently of Otto Seitz, Gabriel and Max Lindenschmitt in Munich.\r\nHis first work, \"Ahasuerus, the Wandering Jew,\" received a medal in\r\nMunich. One of his pictures, \"Episode of 1813,\" is in the Royal Hanover\r\nGallery, and his \"Germany in 1806\" received a gold medal in Munich and\r\nis in the Royal Academy of Koenigsberg. A large canvas \"The\r\nFlagellants,\" now in the Milwaukee public library, received a gold medal\r\nat the Munich Exposition in 1889. Another canvas, \"Summer Afternoon,\" in\r\nthe Phoebe Hearst collection, received a gold medal in Berlin, in 1892.\r\nMarr became a professor in the Munich Academy in 1893, and in 1895 a\r\nmember of the Berlin Academy of Arts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRADI, GIOVANNI (1852-   ), Italian poet, was born at Leghorn, and\r\neducated at Pisa and Florence. At the latter place he started with\r\nothers a short-lived review, the _Nuovi Goliardi_, which made some\r\nliterary sensation. He became a teacher at various colleges, and\r\neventually an educational inspector in Massa Carrara. He was much\r\ninfluenced by Carducci, and became known not only as a critic but as a\r\ncharming descriptive poet, his principal volumes of verse being _Canzone\r\nmoderne_ (1870), _Fantasie marnie_ (1881), _Canzoni e fantasie_ (1853),\r\n_Ricordi lirici_ (1884), _Poesie_ (1887), _Nuovi canti_ (1891) and\r\n_Ballate moderne_ (1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRAKESH (erroneously MOROCCO or MAROCCO CITY), one of the\r\nquasi-capitals of the sultanate of Morocco, Fez and Mequinez being the\r\nother two. It lies in a spacious plain--Blad el Hamra, \"The Red\"--about\r\n15 m. from the northern underfalls of the Atlas, and 96 m. E.S.E. of\r\nSaffi, at a height variously estimated at 1639 ft. (Hooker and Ball) and\r\n1410 ft. (Beaumier). Ranking during the early centuries of its existence\r\nas one of the greatest cities of Islam, Marrakesh has long been in a\r\nstate of grievous decay, but it is rendered attractive by the\r\nexceptional beauty of its situation, the luxuriant groves and gardens by\r\nwhich it is encompassed and interspersed, and the magnificent outlook\r\nwhich it enjoys towards the mountains. The wall, 25 or 30 ft. high, and\r\nrelieved at intervals of 360 ft. by square towers, is so dilapidated\r\nthat foot-passengers, and in places even horsemen, can find their way\r\nthrough the breaches. Open spaces of great extent are numerous within\r\nthe walls, but for the most part they are defaced by mounds of rubbish\r\nand putrid refuse. With the exception of the tower of the Kutubia Mosque\r\nand a certain archway which was brought in pieces from Spain, there is\r\nnot, it is asserted, a single stone building in the city; and even\r\nbricks (although the local manufacture is of excellent quality) are\r\nsparingly employed. _Tabiya_ or rammed concrete of red earth and stone\r\nis the almost universal building material, and the houses are\r\nconsequently seldom more than two storeys in height. The palace of the\r\nsultan covers an extensive area, and beyond it lie the imperial parks of\r\nAgudal, the inner one reserved for the sultan's exclusive use. The tower\r\nof the Kutubia is a memorial of the constructive genius of the early\r\nMoors; both it and the similar Hasan tower at Rabat are after the type\r\nof the contemporary Giralda at Seville, and if tradition may be trusted,\r\nall three were designed by the same architect, Jabir. The mosque to\r\nwhich the tower belongs is a large brick building erected by 'Abd el\r\nMumin; the interior is adorned with marble pillars, and the whole of the\r\ncrypt is occupied by a vast cistern excavated by Yakub el Mansur. Other\r\nmosques of some note are those of Ibn Yusef, El Mansur and El Mo'izz;\r\nthe chapel of Sidi Bel Abbas, in the extreme north of the city,\r\npossesses property of great value, and serves as an almshouse and\r\nasylum. There is a special Jews' quarter walled off from the rest. The\r\ngeneral population is of a very mixed and turbulent kind; crimes of\r\nviolence are common, and there are many professional thieves. The murder\r\nof a Frenchman, Dr Mauchamp, in March 1907, by the rabble of Marrakesh\r\nwas the immediate cause of the occupation of Udja by France (see\r\nMOROCCO: _History_). Almost the only manufacture extensively prosecuted\r\nis that of Morocco leather, mainly red and yellow, about 1,500 men being\r\nemployed as tanners and shoemakers. Scottish missionaries and a few\r\nEuropean traders have become established here. The city was founded in\r\n1062 by Yusef bin Tashfin. Before it was a hundred years old it is said\r\nto have had 700,000 inhabitants, but the population in 1906 probably did\r\nnot exceed 50,000 to 60,000.\r\n\r\n  See Leo Africanus, and Paul Lambert's detailed description in _Notice\r\n  sur la ville de Maroc_ (Paris, 1868). Lambert's plan of Marrakesh is\r\n  reproduced with some additions by Dr A. Leared, and another may be\r\n  found in Gatell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRI, a Baluch tribe on the Dera Ghazi Khan border of Baluchistan. In\r\nthe census of 1901 they numbered 19,161 and their fighting strength is\r\nabout 3000. Their relations with the British commenced in 1840 with\r\nattacks made on the communications of Sir John Keane's army, after it\r\nhad passed through the Bolan. An attempt was made to punish the tribe,\r\nwhich ended in disastrous failure. Major Clibborn was repulsed in an\r\nattempt to storm the Naffusak Pass, losing 179 killed and 92 wounded out\r\nof 650. Many of his force died of heat and thirst. The fort of Kahan,\r\nwhich he was trying to relieve at the time, was forced to capitulate\r\nwith the honours of war. The Marris, however, joined the British against\r\nthe Bugtis in 1845. After the annexation of Sind in 1843 the Marris gave\r\nmuch trouble, but were pacified by the policy of General John Jacob and\r\nSir Robert Sandeman. In 1880 during the second Afghan War they made\r\nfrequent raids on the British line of communications, ending with the\r\nplunder of a treasure convoy. A force of 3070 British troops under\r\nBrigadier-General Macgregor marched through the country, and the tribe\r\nsubmitted and paid 1¼ lakh (£12,500) out of a fine of 2 lakhs (£20,000);\r\nthey also gave hostages for their future good behaviour. Since then they\r\nhave given little trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Marri-Bugti country is classed as a tribal area in Baluchistan,\r\npolitically controlled from Sibi, but enjoying a large measure of\r\nautonomy under its own chieftains. Total area, 7129 sq. m.; total pop.\r\n(1901), 38,919, almost equally divided between the two tribes of Marris\r\nand Bugtis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE. Marriage (Fr. _mariage_, from _marier_, to marry; Lat.\r\n_maritare_, from _mas_, _maris_, a male), or \"matrimony\" (Lat.\r\n_matrimonium_, from _mater_, a mother), may be defined either (a) as the\r\nact, ceremony, or process by which the legal relationship of husband and\r\nwife is constituted; or (b) as a physical, legal and moral union between\r\nman and woman in complete community of life for the establishment of a\r\nfamily.[1] It is possible to discriminate between three stages, taking\r\nmarriage in the latter sense as an institution--the animal or physical\r\nstage, the proprietary or legal stage, and the personal or moral stage.\r\nIn the first or physical stage the relation of the sexes was\r\nunregulated, and in many cases of brief duration. In the second or legal\r\nstage greater permanence was secured in marriage by assigning the\r\nhusband a property right in his wife or wives. In the last stage the\r\nproprietary relation falls more and more into the background, and the\r\nrelation of husband and wife approximates that of two individuals\r\nentirely equal before the law. Although in the history of marriage these\r\nthree stages have been roughly successive, the order of their entering\r\nthe conscious experience of the individual is usually the reverse of\r\ntheir order in the development of the race; and in the solemnization of\r\na marriage based upon affection and choice the growth of the relation\r\nbegins with the moral, advances to the legal and culminates in the\r\nphysical union, each one of these deriving its meaning and its worth\r\nfrom the preceding. In most legal systems marriage, in the sense of a\r\nceremony, takes the form of a contract--the mutual assent of the parties\r\nbeing the prominent and indispensable feature. Whether it is really a\r\ncontract or not, and if so to what class of contracts it belongs, are\r\nquestions which have been much discussed, but into which it is not\r\nnecessary to enter. While the consent of parties is universally deemed\r\none of the conditions of a legal marriage, all the incidents of the\r\nrelationship constituted by the act are absolutely fixed by law. The\r\njurist has to deal with marriage in so far as it creates the legal\r\nstatus of husband and wife. It should be added that, while marriage is\r\ngenerally spoken of by lawyers as a contract, its complete isolation\r\nfrom all other contracts is invariably recognized. Its peculiar position\r\nmay be seen at once by comparing it with other contracts giving rise to\r\ncontinuous relationships with more or less indefinite obligations, like\r\nthose of landlord and tenant, master and servant, &c. In these the\r\nparties may in general make their rights and duties what they please,\r\nthe law only intervening when they are silent. In marriage every\r\nresulting right and duty is fixed by the law.\r\n\r\n  Besides true marriage, inferior forms of union have from time to time\r\n  been recognized, and may be briefly noticed here. These have all but\r\n  disappeared from modern society, depending as they do on matrimonial\r\n  restrictions now obsolete.\r\n\r\n  The institution of slavery is a fruitful source of this kind of\r\n  debased matrimony. In Roman law no slave could contract marriage\r\n  whether with another slave or a free person. The union of male and\r\n  female slaves (_contubernium_) was recognized for various purposes; a\r\n  free woman entering into a union with a slave incurred under the S.C.\r\n  Claudianum the forfeiture of her own liberty; but the bondwoman might\r\n  be the concubine of a freeman. In the United States, where slavery was\r\n  said to be regulated by the principle of the civil law, the marriage\r\n  of slaves was so far recognized that on emancipation complete\r\n  matrimony took effect and the children became legitimate without any\r\n  new ceremony.\r\n\r\n  In Roman law no legal marriage could be contracted unless there was\r\n  _connubium_ between the parties. Originally there was no connubium\r\n  between plebs and patricians, and the privilege was conceded after a\r\n  long struggle by the Lex Canuleia. In later times Latini and Peregrini\r\n  were excluded from connubium except where the right had been expressly\r\n  conferred. The great matrimonial law of the early empire (Lex Julia et\r\n  Papia Poppaea) introduced restrictions depending on the condition of\r\n  the parties which later legislation extended and perpetuated. Senators\r\n  under that law were forbidden to marry freedwomen or women of inferior\r\n  rank, and the husband of a freedwoman becoming a senator was set free\r\n  from his marriage. In the canon law[2] new restrictions were\r\n  developed. Persons who bound themselves not to marry were deemed\r\n  incapable of marrying. The order of the clergy were forbidden to\r\n  marry. And disparity of faith was recognized by the early church as a\r\n  bar to matrimony, e.g. between Christians and pagans and between\r\n  orthodox and heretics (see _Dictionary of Christian Antiquities_, art.\r\n  \"Marriage\").\r\n\r\n  CONCUBINAGE, which such restrictions tended to develop, is noticed\r\n  under a separate heading (q.v.). It might be described as marriage\r\n  which has no consequences, or only slight and peculiar consequences,\r\n  in legal _status_. In the left-handed or \"morganatic\" marriages of the\r\n  German royal families we have the nearest approach ever made by\r\n  concubinage to true marriage, the children being legitimate, but\r\n  neither they nor the wife acquiring any right to the rank or fortune\r\n  of the husband. The marriage of persons of different religions\r\n  frequently requires the intervention of the law as to the faith of the\r\n  children, more particularly in Europe as between Roman Catholics and\r\n  Protestants. English law gives the father, except under special\r\n  circumstances, the right to dictate the faith of his children (see\r\n  INFANT). The practice on this point varies in Europe--the question\r\n  being ignored in French law, Germany following in some parts the same\r\n  rule as England, in others giving effect to ante-nuptial stipulations.\r\n  In Ireland mixed marriages (i.e. between Roman Catholic and\r\n  Protestant) were by 19 Geo. II. c. 13 null and void if celebrated by a\r\n  Roman Catholic priest. This act was repealed by 33 & 34 Vict. c. 110,\r\n  which permits mixed marriages to be validly celebrated by an\r\n  Episcopalian or Roman Catholic clergyman, subject to conditions set\r\n  forth in § 38.\r\n\r\n_Roman law._--The three primitive modes of marriage were _confarreatio_,\r\n_coemptio in manum_, and _usus_, all of which had the effect of placing\r\nthe woman in the \"power\" (_manus_) of her husband, and on the same\r\nfooting as the children. The first was a religious ceremony before ten\r\nwitnesses, in which an ox was sacrificed and a wheaten cake broken and\r\ndivided between the spouses by the priest. _Coemptio_ was a conveyance\r\nof the woman by _mancipatio_, and might be described as a fictitious\r\nsale _per aes et libram_, like that employed in emancipation and\r\ntestamentary disposition and other processes. _Usus_ was the acquisition\r\nof the wife by prescription, through her cohabiting with the husband for\r\none year, without having been absent from his house three continuous\r\nnights. But a true marriage might be concluded without adopting any of\r\nthese modes, and they all fell into desuetude and with them the\r\nsubjection of the wife to the _manus_. Marriage without _manus_ was\r\ncontracted by the interchange of consent, without writing or formality\r\nof any kind. By some jurists it is regarded as incomplete until\r\nconsummated by delivery of the woman, and is accordingly referred to the\r\nclass of _real_ contracts. The restrictions as to age, relationship by\r\nconsanguinity and affinity, previous marriage, &c., were in the main\r\nthose which have continued to prevail in modern Europe with one\r\nimportant exception. The consent of the _paterfamilias_ to the marriage\r\nof the children under his power was essential.\r\n\r\n_Canon law._--The canon law of marriage is based partly on the Roman\r\nlaw, the validity of which the Church from the first recognized, partly\r\non the Jewish law as modified by the new principles introduced by Christ\r\nand his apostles, developed by the fathers of the Church and medieval\r\nschoolmen, and regulated and defined by popes and councils. The most\r\nimportant of these principles was that of the indissolubility of\r\nmarriage, proclaimed by Christ without qualification according to Mark\r\nx. 11, 12, and with the qualifying clause \"saving for the cause of\r\nfornication\" according to Matt. v. 32. This lofty view of marriage,\r\naccording to which man and wife are made \"one flesh\" by the act of God\r\n(\"What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder,\" Mark\r\nx. 9) was, however, modified by the idea of the consummating act of\r\nmarriage as in itself something unholy, a result of the Fall. Christ\r\nhimself, indeed, did not teach this; but for St Paul marriage is clearly\r\na concession to the weakness of the flesh (1 Cor. vii.). \"The time is\r\nshort,\" and in view of the imminent coming of the Lord the procreation\r\nof children a matter of no importance (v. 29), but \"it is better to\r\nmarry than to burn\" (v. 9). He is, however, obviously not clear on the\r\npoint, and at the end of his argument strikes a note of doubt (v. 40);\r\nelsewhere he defends marriage, against those who would have forbidden it\r\naltogether, as a gift of God (1 Tit. iv. 3-5) and even, in seeming\r\ncontradiction to 1 Cor. vii. 29, commands the bearing of children (1\r\nTit. v. 14). Finally it is to St Paul that the idea of marriage as a\r\nsacrament is to be traced, in the mystic comparison of the relations of\r\nhusband and wife to those of Christ and his Church (Eph. v. 23-32).\r\nThese are the main foundations in Scripture on which the Christian law\r\nof marriage is built up, and they are obviously principles which admit\r\nof a large amount of variety of interpretation and of practice. They\r\nwere developed in the early Church under the influence of the rapidly\r\ngrowing passion for the celibate life, partly an outcome of the same\r\ndualistic principle which produced the asceticism of the Jewish Essenes\r\nand of the Gnostics, partly perhaps a natural reaction from the\r\nappalling moral corruption of the decaying empire. Marriage, it is true,\r\nfrom being no more than a terminable civil contract, became a thing\r\nholy, a mystic union of souls and bodies never to be divided; valid,\r\nindeed, but not spiritually complete, without the public blessing of the\r\nChurch (Tertullian, _Ad uxorem_, lib. ii. cap. 9); and from Augustine's\r\ntime onward it was reckoned as a sacrament. But at the same time there\r\nwas a tendency to restrict its rights and its range. So far as marriage\r\nwas a physical union, this had for its object solely the perpetuation of\r\nthe race and the avoidance of fornication; the most that was conceded\r\nwas that the intention of having offspring not only made the conjugal\r\nact blameless, but even gave to the desire that inspired it an element\r\nof good (Augustine, _de nupt. et conc._ 3). But the ideal married life\r\nwas that attributed to Mary and Joseph. Thus Augustine cited this as an\r\nexample that a true marriage may exist where there is a mutual vow of\r\nchastity (_op. cit._ 12), and held that the sooner this relation was\r\nestablished the better (_de bono conjug._ 22). Marriage being then an\r\ninferior state, to be discouraged rather than the reverse, the tendency\r\nwas rapidly to narrow the field within which it might be contracted.\r\nRemarriage (bigamy) was only allowed after many struggles, and then only\r\nto the laity; St Paul had laid down that a \"bishop\" must be \"the husband\r\nof one wife,\" and to this day the priests of the Orthodox Eastern Church\r\nmay not remarry. Clerical celibacy, at first a counsel of perfection,\r\nwas soon to become the rule of the Church, though it was long before it\r\nwas universally enforced in the West; in the East it still applies only\r\nto monks, nuns and bishops (see CELIBACY). The marriage of the laity was\r\nhampered by the creation of a number of impediments. The few and\r\ndefinite prohibitions of the Roman and of the Jewish law (Lev. xviii.\r\n6-18; xx.) in the matter of marriage between kindred, were indefinitely\r\nextended; until in 506 the council of Agde laid it down that any\r\nconsanguinity or affinity whatever constituted an impediment.[3]\r\nMoreover, man and wife being \"one flesh,\" the Church exaggerated\r\nrelationship by affinity into equal importance with that of\r\nconsanguinity as an impediment to matrimony; and, finally, to all this\r\nadded the impediments created by \"spiritual affinity,\" i.e. the\r\nrelations established between baptizer and baptized, confirmer and\r\nconfirmed, and between godparents, their godchildren and their\r\ngodchildren's relatives.\r\n\r\nThe result of this system was hopeless confusion and uncertainty, and it\r\nwas early found necessary to modify it. This was done by Pope Gregory\r\nI., who limited the impediment to the 7th degree of relationship\r\ninclusive (civil computation)[4] which was afterwards made the law of\r\nthe empire by Charlemagne. Later still Innocent III. found it necessary\r\nagain to issue a decree (4th Lateran Council) permitting marriages\r\nbetween a husband and the relations of his wife, and vice versa, beyond\r\nthe 4th degree inclusive (canonical computation).[5] This remains the\r\ncanonical rule of the Roman Catholic Church. As regards impediments due\r\nto spiritual affinity, these were limited by the Council of Trent to the\r\nrelation of the baptizer and baptized; the baptizer and the parents of\r\nthe baptized; the baptizer and the godfather and godmother; the\r\ngodparents and the baptized and its parents: i.e. a godfather may not\r\nmarry the mother of the child he has held at the font, nor the godmother\r\nthe father of such child.\r\n\r\nIn the fully developed canon law impediments to marriage are of two\r\nkinds, public and private (_impedimenta publica_ and _privata_), i.e.\r\naccording as the objection arises out of the very nature of marriage\r\nitself or from consideration for the rights of particular persons; near\r\nrelationship, for instance, is a public impediment, impotence\r\n(_impotentia_) and force (_vis et metus_) are private impediments.\r\nImpediments are further divided into separating (_impedimenta\r\ndirimentia_) or merely suspensive (_impedimenta tantum impedientia_); to\r\nthe first class belongs, e.g. a previous marriage not dissolved by\r\ndeath, which involves the nullification of the marriage even where\r\nthrough ignorance the crime of bigamy is not involved; to the second\r\nbelongs the case of one or both of the contracting parties being under\r\nthe age of puberty.[6] Impediments, moreover, are absolute or relative,\r\naccording as they are of universal application or only affect certain\r\npersons; near relationship, for instance, is an absolute impediment,\r\ndifference of religion between the parties a relative impediment. In\r\naddition to consanguinity and affinity, impuberty and existing marriage,\r\nthe canon law lays down as public and absolute impediments to marriage\r\nthe taking of holy orders and the vows of chastity made on entering any\r\nof the religious orders approved by the Holy See. In these impediments\r\nthe canon law further distinguishes between those which are based on the\r\nlaw of nature (_jus naturae_) and those which are based on the law of\r\nthe Church (_jus ecclesiae_). From impediments based on the law of\r\nnature, or of God, there is no power even in the pope to dispense; e.g.\r\nmarriage of father and daughter, brother and sister, or remarriage of\r\nhusband or wife during the lifetime of the wife or husband of another\r\nmarriage, which is held to be a violation of the very nature of marriage\r\nas an indissoluble union.[7] From impediments arising out of the law of\r\nthe Church dispensations are granted, more or less readily, either by\r\nthe pope or by the bishop of the diocese in virtue of powers delegated\r\nby the pope (see DISPENSATION). Thus dispensations may be granted for\r\nmarriage between persons related by consanguinity in any beyond the 2nd\r\ndegree and not in the direct line of ascent or descent; e.g. between\r\nuncle and niece (confined by the council of Trent to the case of royal\r\nmarriages for reasons of state) and between cousins-german, or in the\r\ncase of marriage with a heretic. In this latter case a dispensation is\r\nnow (i.e. since the papal decrees _ne temere_ of the 2nd of August 1907,\r\nwhich came into force at Easter 1908) only granted on condition that the\r\nparties are married by a Catholic bishop, or a priest accredited by him,\r\nthat no religious ceremony shall take place except in a Catholic church,\r\nand that all the children shall be brought up in the Roman Catholic\r\nfaith.[8]\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any impediment a marriage is according to the canon\r\nlaw completed between baptized persons by the facts of consent and\r\nconsummation; the principle is still maintained that the parties to the\r\nmarriage, not the priest, are the \"ministers of the sacrament\"\r\n(_ministri sacramenti_).[9] From the first, however, the Church, while\r\nrecognizing the validity of private contracts, enjoined the addition of\r\na public religious ceremony, so that they might be \"sanctified by the\r\nword of God and prayer\" (1 Tim. iv. 5).[10] Tertullian (_de pudicitia_,\r\ncap. iv.) says that clandestine marriages, not professed in the Church,\r\nwere reckoned among Christians as all but fornication, and he speaks of\r\nthe custom of seeking permission to marry from the bishop, priests and\r\ndeacons (_de monogamia_, cap. xi.). This latter precaution became\r\nincreasingly necessary as impediments were multiplied, and Charlemagne,\r\nin a capitulary of 802, forbade the celebration of a marriage until \"the\r\nbishops, priests and elders of the people\" had made diligent inquiry\r\ninto the question of the consanguinity of the parties. This was the\r\norigin of the publication of banns which, long customary in France, was\r\nmade obligatory on the whole Church by Pope Innocent III. In the Eastern\r\nChurch the primitive practice survives in the ceremonial blessing by the\r\npriest of the betrothal, as distinguished from the marriage ceremony.\r\nThe ecclesiastical recognition of clandestine marriages, however,\r\nsurvived until the crying evil was remedied by a decree of the council\r\nof Trent (Sess. xiv. _de matrim._),[11] which laid it down that for a\r\nvalid marriage it was at least necessary that consent should be declared\r\nbefore a priest and in the presence of three witnesses. According to the\r\nactual law of the Roman Catholic Church, then, a civil marriage is only\r\nvalid when the Tridentine decree has not been published; where this has\r\nbeen published, or has been in practice without publication, such a\r\nmarriage can only become valid if followed by a religious ceremony in\r\nthe prescribed form. Where such form has not followed the ecclesiastical\r\ncourts must treat the marriage as voidable through the _impedimentum\r\nclandestinitatis_.\r\n\r\nDivorce, i.e. the annulment of marriage for any cause but an impediment\r\nwhich makes the marriage _ipso facto_ void, is unknown to the Roman\r\nCatholic Church. Separation _a vinculo matrimonii_ is only possible\r\nunder the canon law by a judicial decree of nullity (_annullatio\r\nmatrimonii_), which implies, not the severing of the ties of a real\r\nmarriage, but the solemn declaration that such marriage has never\r\nexisted. There may, however, be a \"separation from bed and board\" (_a\r\nthoro et mensa_), even perpetual, which does not however give either\r\nparty the right to remarry during the lifetime of the other. But,\r\nmarriage not being regarded as a sacrament until consummated, it may be\r\ndissolved, if non-consummation he proved, by one or both parties taking\r\nthe religious vows, or by papal dispensation. The Church claims\r\nexclusive control over marriage, and the council of Trent anathematized\r\nthe opinion held by Luther and other Reformers, that it was properly a\r\nsubject for the civil courts (_si quis dixerit causas matrimoniales non\r\nspectare ad judices ecclesiasticos anathema sit_, Sess. xxiv. cap. 2).\r\nThis attitude became of extreme political importance when even in\r\nCatholic countries the codes established civil marriage as the only\r\nlegally binding form.\r\n\r\n_England._--Marriage may be the subject of an ordinary contract on which\r\nan action may be brought by either party. It is not necessary that the\r\npromise should be in writing, or that any particular time should be\r\nnamed. Promises to marry are not within the meaning of \"agreement made\r\nin consideration of marriage\" in the statute of frauds, which requires\r\nsuch agreements to be in writing. Contracts in restraint of marriage,\r\ni.e. whose object is to prevent a person from marrying anybody whatever,\r\nare void, as are also contracts undertaking for reward to procure a\r\nmarriage between two persons. These latter are termed marriage brocage\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\nAny man and woman are capable of marrying, subject to certain\r\ndisabilities, some of which are said to be canonical as having been\r\nformerly under the cognisance of the ecclesiastical courts, others\r\ncivil. The effect of a canonical disability as such was to make the\r\nmarriage not void but voidable. The marriage must be set aside by\r\nregular process, and sentence pronounced during the lifetime of the\r\nparties. Natural inability at the time of the marriage to procreate\r\nchildren is a canonical disability. So was relationship within the\r\nprohibited degrees, which has been made an absolute avoidance of\r\nmarriage by the Marriage Act 1835. Civil disabilities are (1) the fact\r\nthat either party is already married and has a spouse still living;[12]\r\n(2) the fact that either person is a party of unsound mind; (3) want of\r\nfull age, which for this purpose is fixed at the age of puberty as\r\ndefined in the Roman law, viz. fourteen for males and twelve for\r\nfemales;[13] (4) relationship within the prohibited degrees.\r\n\r\nThe statute which lawyers regard as establishing the rule on this last\r\npoint is the 32 Hen. VIII. c. 38 (repealed in part by 2 & 3 Edw. VI. c.\r\n23, in whole by 1 & 2 P. and M. c. 8, but revived by 1 Eliz. c. 1, and\r\nso left as under the Act of Edward), which enacts that \"no prohibition,\r\nGod's law except, shall trouble or impeach any marriage without the\r\nLevitical degrees.\" The forbidden marriages, as more particularly\r\nspecified in previous statutes, are those between persons in the\r\nascending and descending line _in infinitum_, and those between\r\ncollaterals to the third degree inclusive, according to the computation\r\nof the civil law. The prohibitions extend not only to _consanguinei_\r\n(related by blood) but to _affines_ (related by marriage), now altered\r\nso far as a deceased wife's sister is concerned (see below). The act of\r\n1835 enacted that \"all marriages which shall hereafter be celebrated\r\nbetween persons within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity or\r\naffinity shall be absolutely null and void to all intents and purposes\r\nwhatsoever.\" They had previously been only voidable. The act at the same\r\ntime legalized marriages within the prohibited degrees of affinity (but\r\nnot consanguinity) actually celebrated before the 31st of August 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Marriage with a Deceased Wife's Sister.\r\n\r\n  For many years an active and ceaseless agitation was carried on on\r\n  behalf of the legalization in England of marriage with a deceased\r\n  wife's sister. In all the self-governing colonies, with the exception\r\n  of Newfoundland, the restriction had ceased to exist. The first act\r\n  legalizing marriage with a deceased wife's sister was adopted by South\r\n  Australia. The royal assent, however, was not given till the\r\n  parliament of that state had five times passed the bill. In quick\r\n  succession similar statutes followed in Victoria, Tasmania, New South\r\n  Wales, Queensland, New Zealand, West Australia, Barbados, Canada,\r\n  Mauritius, Natal and Cape Colony. As regards the Channel Islands,\r\n  marriages of the kind in question were made legal in 1899, and in 1907\r\n  in the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n  In England the bill to render marriage with a deceased wife's sister\r\n  valid was first adopted by the House of Commons in 1850, and rejected\r\n  by the House of Lords in 1851. It was subsequently brought before the\r\n  legislature in 1855, 1856, 1858, 1859, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1869, 1870,\r\n  1871, 1872, 1873, 1875, 1877 and 1878 (Colonial bills), 1879 (6th May,\r\n  when in the House of Lords the prince of Wales and the duke of\r\n  Edinburgh voted in favour of it), 1880, 1882, 1883, 1884, 1886, 1888,\r\n  1889, 1890, 1891, 1896, and 1898 and 1900 (Colonial bills). In most\r\n  cases it passed the House of Commons but was rejected in the House of\r\n  Lords. The bill of 1896, however, which was judiciously drafted to\r\n  avoid the compulsory celebration by clergymen of marriages against\r\n  which they had conscientious scruples, was carried in the Lords. Both\r\n  the prince of Wales and the duke of York were among the \"contents.\"\r\n  The prime minister and eighteen bishops, including the two\r\n  archbishops, voted against the bill, the earl of Rosebery and Lord\r\n  Kimberley for it. At the third reading the bill was carried by 142 to\r\n  104 votes. Its promoters, however, did not succeed in getting an\r\n  opportunity of bringing it before the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n  From 1896 to 1901 no further direct steps were taken, but in 1898 and\r\n  again in 1900 (May 28) the subject was brought forward in the House of\r\n  Lords by Lord Strathcona in the form of a bill under which marriages\r\n  with a deceased wife's sister contracted in any British colony should\r\n  be deemed valid for all purposes within the United Kingdom. In 1898,\r\n  and again in 1900, the bill was carried on the third reading without a\r\n  dissentient vote. The House of Commons took no action on either\r\n  occasion. An imperial bill reached a second reading in the House of\r\n  Commons in 1901 and again in 1902, but it was blocked by the High\r\n  Church opponents of the measure when attempts were made to get it to\r\n  the committee stage (Feb. 5 and June 6). The reform was, however,\r\n  finally adopted in 1906 under the title of the Colonial Marriages\r\n  (Deceased Wife's Sister) Act. The effect of the act was to make such\r\n  marriages legal in all respects, including the right of succession to\r\n  real property and to honours and dignities within the United Kingdom.\r\n  The natural sequence of the passing of the act of 1906 was the\r\n  reintroduction in 1907 of the bill relating to England. Introduced by\r\n  a private member, it was adopted by the government, passed the House\r\n  of Commons, and finally the House of Lords (on the second reading by\r\n  111 votes to 79), and became law as the Deceased Wife's Sister\r\n  Marriage Act, 1907. The act contains a proviso justifying clergymen in\r\n  refusing to solemnize marriages with a deceased wife's sister, and it\r\n  preserves the peculiar status of the wife's sister under the\r\n  Matrimonial Causes Act 1857, under which adultery with her by the\r\n  husband is incestuous adultery.\r\n\r\n  The celebration of marriages is now regulated wholly by statutory\r\n  legislation. The most important acts in force are the Marriage Acts\r\n  1823, 1836, 1886 and 1898.[14] The former regulates marriages within\r\n  the Church of England, but was intended to be of universal\r\n  application, Jews and Quakers only being excepted by section 31. It\r\n  requires either the previous publication of banns, or a licence from\r\n  the proper ecclesiastical authority. As to banns, the rule of the\r\n  rubric, so far as not altered by the statute, is required to be\r\n  observed. They must be published on three successive Sundays at\r\n  morning service after the second lesson, in the church of the parish\r\n  in which the parties dwell; the bishop may, however, authorize the\r\n  publication of banns in a public chapel. Seven days' notice must be\r\n  given to the clergyman of the names of the parties, their place of\r\n  abode, and the time during which they have lived there. If either\r\n  party is under age, the dissent of the parents or guardians expressed\r\n  at the time of publication of banns renders such publication null and\r\n  void. Licence in lieu of banns may only be granted by the archbishop,\r\n  bishop or other authority, for the solemnization of a marriage within\r\n  the church of the parish in which one of the parties shall have\r\n  resided for fifteen days before. Before a licence can be granted an\r\n  oath must be taken as to the fact of residence and that the necessary\r\n  consent has been obtained in the case of persons under age. The\r\n  father, or lawful guardian, is the proper person to consent to the\r\n  marriage of a minor, and the place of any such person incapacitated\r\n  mentally is taken by the lord chancellor. The absence of such consent\r\n  does not, however, avoid a marriage once solemnized. But if persons\r\n  wilfully intermarry (unless by special licence) in a place not being a\r\n  church or public chapel, or without due publication of banns or proper\r\n  licence, or before a person not in holy orders, the marriage is null\r\n  and void to all purposes. Marriage must be celebrated within three\r\n  months after banns or licence, and between the hours of eight in the\r\n  morning and three in the afternoon.\r\n\r\n  For the relief of the great body of Dissenters the act of 1836 was\r\n  passed. It permits marriage to be solemnized in two additional\r\n  ways--viz. (1) by certificate of the superintendent registrar of a\r\n  district without licence, and (2) by such certificate with licence. In\r\n  the first case, notice must be given to the registrar of the district\r\n  or districts within which the parties have resided for seven days\r\n  previous, which notice is inscribed in a marriage-notice book, open to\r\n  public inspection at all reasonable times, and thereafter suspended\r\n  for twenty-one days in some conspicuous place in the registrar's\r\n  office. Any person whose consent is necessary to an ecclesiastical\r\n  licence may forbid the issue of a certificate, but in default of such\r\n  prohibition the certificate will issue at the end of the twenty-one\r\n  days. The marriage may then take place on any day within three months\r\n  of the entry of notice, and in one of the following ways: (1) in a\r\n  certified place of religious worship, registered for the solemnization\r\n  of marriage; in that case a registrar of the district with two\r\n  witnesses must be present, and the ceremony must include a mutual\r\n  declaration of assent by the parties and a disavowal of any\r\n  impediment; (2) at the superintendent registrar's office, with the\r\n  same declaration, but with no religious service; (3) in a church\r\n  according to the usual form, the consent of the minister thereof\r\n  having been previously obtained; (4) according to the usages of Jews\r\n  and Quakers. The place of marriage in all cases must have been\r\n  specified in the notice and certificate.\r\n\r\n  In the second case, when it is desired to proceed by licence, notice\r\n  must be given to the registrar of the district in which one of the\r\n  persons resides, together with a declaration that he or she has\r\n  resided for fifteen days therein, that there is no impediment, and\r\n  that the necessary consents if any have been obtained. The notice is\r\n  not exhibited in the registrar's office, and the certificate may be\r\n  obtained at the expiration of one whole day after entry, together with\r\n  the licence. No registrar's licence can be granted for a marriage in\r\n  church or according to the forms of the Church of England--the\r\n  ecclesiastical authorities retaining their jurisdiction in that\r\n  respect. It is also provided that in the case of persons wilfully\r\n  intermarrying in a place other than that mentioned in the notice and\r\n  certificate, or without notice or certificate, &c., the marriage shall\r\n  be null and void.\r\n\r\n  The various rules as to consent of parents, &c., to the marriages of\r\n  minors are regulations of procedure only. The absence of the necessary\r\n  consent is not a disability invalidating a marriage actually\r\n  solemnized.\r\n\r\n  The Act 26 Geo. II. c. 33, commonly known as Lord Hardwicke's Act,\r\n  which forbids the solemnization of marriage without banns or licence,\r\n  also enacts that \"in no case whatsoever shall any suit or proceeding\r\n  be had in any ecclesiastical court in order to compel a celebration\r\n  _in facie ecclesiae_, by reason of any contract of matrimony\r\n  whatsoever whether _per verba de presenti_ or _per verba de futuro_.\"\r\n  Blackstone observes that previous to this act \"any contract made _per\r\n  verba de presenti_, or in words of the present tense, and in case of\r\n  cohabitation _per verba de futuro_ also, was deemed valid marriage to\r\n  many purposes; and the parties might be compelled in the spiritual\r\n  courts to celebrate it _in facie ecclesiae_.\"\r\n\r\n  Royal marriages in England have been subject to special laws. The\r\n  Royal Marriage Act of 1772 (12 Geo. III. c. 11), passed in consequence\r\n  of the marriages of the dukes of Cumberland and Gloucester, enacted\r\n  that \"no descendant of his late majesty George II. (other than the\r\n  issue of princesses married or who may marry into foreign families)\r\n  shall be capable of contracting matrimony without the previous consent\r\n  of his majesty, his heirs and successors, signified under the Great\r\n  Seal. But in case any descendant of George II., being above\r\n  twenty-five years old, shall persist to contract a marriage\r\n  disapproved of by his majesty, such descendant, after giving twelve\r\n  months' notice to the privy council, may contract such marriage, and\r\n  the same may be duly solemnized without the consent of his majesty,\r\n  &c., and shall be good except both Houses of Parliament shall declare\r\n  their disapprobation thereto.\"\r\n\r\n  In 1886 an act was passed in the British parliament to remove doubts\r\n  which had been entertained as to the validity of certain marriages\r\n  solemnized in England when one of the parties was resident in\r\n  Scotland. The Summary Jurisdiction (Married Women) Act of 1895 enabled\r\n  a wife whose husband is convicted of an assault on her, or who has\r\n  been deserted by him, or been obliged owing to his cruelty to live\r\n  apart from him, to apply to the justices, who are empowered by the act\r\n  to make an order for separation and for payment by the husband to his\r\n  wife of such weekly sum, not exceeding two pounds, as they may\r\n  consider reasonable. The Marriage Act 1898 authorized the celebration\r\n  of marriages in places of worship duly registered for the\r\n  solemnization of marriages under the Marriage Act of 1836 without the\r\n  presence of the registrar, on condition of their being solemnized in\r\n  the presence of a person duly authorized by the governing body of the\r\n  place of worship in question. It also made further provision for the\r\n  due recording of all marriages in the general registers. The Marriages\r\n  Validity Act of 1899 removed doubts as to the validity of marriages in\r\n  England on Irish banns and in Ireland on English banns. Lastly, the\r\n  Marriage with Foreigners Act 1906 enabled a British subject desirous\r\n  of marrying a foreigner in a foreign country to comply with the\r\n  foreign law by obtaining from a registrar a certificate that no legal\r\n  impediment to the marriage has been shown. Similar certificates, by\r\n  arrangement between His Majesty and foreign countries, are issued in\r\n  the case of a foreigner desirous of marrying a British subject in the\r\n  United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n  The Foreign Marriage Act 1892 has consolidated the English law\r\n  relating to marriages celebrated abroad, and brings it into harmony\r\n  with the current tendencies of marriage law reform generally. Under it\r\n  a marriage between British subjects abroad is as valid as a marriage\r\n  duly solemnized in England (as heretofore), if celebrated in\r\n  accordance with the local law or in the presence of diplomatic or\r\n  consular agents who are appointed to act as \"marriage officers.\" The\r\n  old fiction of assimilation of a British embassy to British soil can\r\n  no longer be relied upon to uphold a marriage at a British embassy\r\n  solemnized by an ordained clergyman. An order in council of the 28th\r\n  of October 1892, moreover, provides that in the case of any marriage\r\n  under the act, if it appears to the marriage officer that the woman\r\n  about to be married is a British subject, and that the man is an\r\n  alien, he must be satisfied that the marriage will be recognized by\r\n  the law of the foreign country to which the alien belongs.\r\n\r\n  A marriage may be solemnized on board one of His Majesty's ships at a\r\n  foreign station, provided a warrant of a secretary of state has\r\n  authorized the commanding officer to be a marriage officer. At sea,\r\n  marriages on British public or private ships seem still valid at\r\n  common law, if performed by an episcopally ordained minister. The\r\n  Merchant Shipping Act 1894 (sect. 240) provides that the master of a\r\n  ship for which an official log is required shall enter in it every\r\n  marriage taking place on board, with the names and ages of the\r\n  parties.\r\n\r\n  Again, under the Foreign Marriage Act all marriages solemnized within\r\n  the British lines by a chaplain or officer or other person officiating\r\n  under the orders of the commanding officer of a British army serving\r\n  abroad, are as valid in law as if they had been solemnized within the\r\n  United Kingdom subject to due observance of all forms required by law.\r\n  The Naval Marriages Act 1908 authorizes, for the purpose of marriages\r\n  in the United Kingdom, the publication of banns and the issue of\r\n  certificates on board His Majesty's ships in certain cases, or when\r\n  one of the parties to a marriage intended to be solemnized in the\r\n  United Kingdom is an officer, seaman or marine, borne on the books of\r\n  one of His Majesty's ships at sea.\r\n\r\n  The principle of the English law of marriage, that a marriage\r\n  contracted abroad is valid if it has been solemnized according to the\r\n  _lex loci_, may be now taken to apply just as much to a marriage in a\r\n  heathen as in a Christian country. Whether the marriage has or has not\r\n  been celebrated according to Christian laws has no bearing upon the\r\n  question, providing it is a monogamous marriage--a marriage which\r\n  prevents the man who enters into it from marrying any other woman\r\n  while his wife continues alive.\r\n\r\n_Scotland._--The chief point of distinction, as compared with English\r\nlaw, is the recognition of irregular marriages. (1) \"A public or regular\r\nmarriage,\" says Fraser, \"is one celebrated, after due proclamation of\r\nbanns, by a minister of religion; and it may be celebrated either in a\r\nchurch or in a private house, and on any day of the week at any hour of\r\nthe day.\" The ministers of the National Church at first alone could\r\nperform the ceremony; but the privilege was extended to Episcopalians by\r\n10 Anne c. 7 (1711), and to other ministers by 4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 28\r\n(1834). (2) A marriage may also \"be constituted by declarations made by\r\nthe man and the woman that they _presently_ do take each other for\r\nhusband and wife.\" These declarations \"may be emitted on any day at any\r\ntime and without the presence of witnesses,\" and either by writing or\r\norally or by signs, and in any form which is clearly expressive of\r\nintention. Such a marriage is as effectual to all intents and purposes\r\nas a public marriage. The children of it would be legitimate; and the\r\nparties to it would have all the rights in the property of each other,\r\ngiven by the law of Scotland to husband and wife. (3) A promise followed\r\nby _copula_ does not constitute marriage, unless followed either by\r\nsolemnization _in facie ecclesiae_ or declarator. Lord Moncreiff's\r\nopinion in the case of _Brown_ v. _Burns_ is admitted to be good law,\r\nviz. that declarator is essential to the constitution of a marriage of\r\nthis kind, so that, if no such declarator be brought in the lifetime of\r\nboth parties, the marriage can never be established afterwards. The\r\n_copula_ is presumed to have reference to the promise, but evidence may\r\nbe adduced to show that such was not the case.\r\n\r\n  By the Marriage (Scotland) Act 1856 it is enacted that no _irregular_\r\n  marriage shall be valid in Scotland, unless one of the parties has\r\n  lived in Scotland for the twenty-one days next preceding the marriage,\r\n  or has his or her usual residence there at the time.\r\n\r\n  \"Habit and repute\" has sometimes been spoken of as constituting\r\n  marriage in the law of Scotland, but it is more correctly described as\r\n  evidence from which marriage may be inferred. The repute must be the\r\n  general, constant, and unvarying belief of friends and neighbours, not\r\n  merely the controverted opinion of a section of them. The cohabitation\r\n  must be in Scotland, but in one case proof of cohabitation in another\r\n  country was allowed, as tending to throw light on the nature of the\r\n  cohabitation in Scotland.\r\n\r\n  The consent of parents is not necessary to the validity of the\r\n  marriage, even of minors, but marriage under the age of puberty with\r\n  or without such consent is void.\r\n\r\n_United States._--The absence of ecclesiastical courts has suggested\r\ndifficulties as to the extent to which the law of England on this\r\nsubject continued to prevail after the revolution. Bishop holds it to be\r\nthe universal fact running through all the cases that everywhere in the\r\ncountry the English decisions on marriage and divorce are referred to\r\nwith the same apparent deference which is shown on other subjects to the\r\ndecisions of the English common law and equity tribunals. The same\r\nauthor observes that \"all our marriage and divorce laws, and of course\r\nall our statutes on the subject, in so far as they pertain to localities\r\nembraced within the limits of particular states, are state laws and\r\nstate statutes, the national power with us not having legislative or\r\njudicial cognisance of the matter within those localities.\" Some of the\r\nstates have extended the ages below which marriage cannot take place.\r\nThe common law of the states is assumed to be that \"a contract _per\r\nverba de presenti, or per verba de futuro cum copula_, constitutes a\r\ncomplete marriage.\" Conditions, however, may be imposed by the various\r\nstate legislatures, and as to these the rule has established itself in\r\nAmerican jurisprudence that \"a marriage good at common law is good\r\nnotwithstanding the existence of any statute on the subject, unless the\r\nstatute contains express words of nullity.\" Thus in Pennsylvania, where\r\na statute provided that all marriages \"should be solemnized before\r\ntwelve witnesses,\" marriages not so celebrated were nevertheless held to\r\nbe good. In New Hampshire justices and ministers of the gospel are\r\nauthorized to solemnize marriage, and all other persons are forbidden to\r\ndo so under penalties; yet a marriage by consent, as at common law,\r\nwithout justice or minister, has been held valid. On the other hand,\r\nunder a very similar statute in Massachusetts, it was held that \"parties\r\ncould not solemnize their own marriage,\" and that a marriage by mutual\r\nagreement, not in accordance with the statute, was void. Bishop regards\r\nthis as an isolated exception to the general course of the decisions. So\r\nwhen state legislation requires any particular form to be used the want\r\nthereof only invalidates the act if the statute expressly so enacts.\r\nMany of the state codes inflict penalties on ministers or justices for\r\ncelebrating the marriage of minors without the consent of the parents or\r\nguardians. The original law as to prohibited degrees has been\r\nconsiderably modified in the states. The prohibition of marriage with a\r\ndeceased wife's sister has been abolished in the United States. But New\r\nHampshire, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, Arkansas, Nevada, Washington, the\r\nDakotas and Montana have for long forbidden marriages between first\r\ncousins by blood, and Louisiana, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Michigan,\r\nNebraska, Utah and Wisconsin have since adopted the same principle.\r\nVirginia prohibits the marriage of a woman with the husband of her\r\nbrother's or sister's daughter.\r\n\r\n  Attention is also being paid to the question of marriage from a\r\n  physical point of view. New Jersey prohibits the marriage of any\r\n  person who has been confined in any public asylum as an epileptic,\r\n  insane or feeble-minded patient, without a medical certificate from\r\n  two physicians of complete recovery, and that there is no probability\r\n  of the transmission of such defects. This prohibits the granting of a\r\n  marriage licence where either party is an habitual drunkard,\r\n  epileptic, imbecile or insane, or where the applicant at the time of\r\n  making application is under the influence of any intoxicant or\r\n  narcotic drug. In Michigan, Minnesota, Kansas and Oregon, marriage is\r\n  prohibited to epileptics, &c., except when the woman is over\r\n  forty-five. In Michigan, also, marriage is forbidden to anyone who has\r\n  suffered from a venereal disease and has not been cured. The equality\r\n  of property rights between husband and wife is fully established in\r\n  America. Indeed, in many states the movement has gone so far as to\r\n  give the wife in matters of property and in reference to divorce\r\n  greater privileges than the husband. Thus a husband is often liable\r\n  for a wife's debts where a wife would not be, _mutatis mutandis_, for\r\n  a husband's; and a wife may usually obtain a decree of divorce for any\r\n  ground on which one may be awarded to the husband, and, in addition,\r\n  for neglect to provide sustenance or support. Emphasis on the personal\r\n  or moral relation of the parties in marriage tends to throw into the\r\n  background the legal aspects and requirements; and it tends also to\r\n  minimize, so far as the state is concerned, the religious and\r\n  sacramental aspect of marriage. Marriage tends to become a relation\r\n  established by parties between themselves, and one in which the\r\n  consent of the parties becomes the only constitutive element. In the\r\n  theory of American law no ceremony is essential to create the marriage\r\n  relation. But this position has never been endorsed by any\r\n  considerable proportion of the community, and in fact probably\r\n  (9/10)ths and perhaps (99/100)ths of the marriages in the United\r\n  States are contracted through some ceremony.\r\n\r\n_France._--Articles 144-226 of the Code Napoléon, as amended by an act\r\nof 1907, prescribe the qualifications and conditions of marriage. The\r\nman must be eighteen and the woman fifteen years of age. A son and\r\ndaughter under twenty-one cannot marry without consent of the father and\r\nmother, or of the father only if they disagree, or of the survivor if\r\none be dead. If both are dead grandfather and grandmother take their\r\nplace. Between the ages of twenty-one and thirty the parties must still\r\nobtain the consent of their parents, but if this be refused it can be\r\nregulated by means of a \"respectful and formal act\" before a notary. If\r\nthe consent is not given within thirty days the marriage may take place\r\nwithout it. If neither parents nor grandparents be alive, parties under\r\ntwenty-one require the consent of the family council. These rules apply\r\nto natural children when affiliated; those not affiliated require the\r\nconsent of a specially appointed guardian. Marriage is prohibited\r\nbetween all ascendants and descendants in the direct line, and between\r\npersons related by marriage in the same line, between brother and\r\nsister, between uncle and niece, and brother-in-law and sister-in-law.\r\n\r\n  Before the solemnization of marriage banns are required to be\r\n  published for a period of ten days, which must include two Sundays,\r\n  containing the names, occupations, and domiciles of the parties and\r\n  their parents. There must be an interval of three days before the\r\n  marriage can take place, and if a year is allowed to elapse fresh\r\n  banns must be put up. On the day appointed by the parties, and in the\r\n  parish to which one of them belongs, the marriage is celebrated by the\r\n  civil officer or registrar reading over to them the various necessary\r\n  documents, with the chapter of the code relating to husband and wife,\r\n  receiving from each a declaration that they take each other for\r\n  husband and wife, and drawing up the act of marriage. All this has to\r\n  be done in the presence of four witnesses.\r\n\r\n  Marriages contracted abroad between French subjects or between French\r\n  subjects and foreigners are valid in France if celebrated according to\r\n  the forms of the foreign law, provided the French conditions as to\r\n  consent of parents have been observed. (See also Marriage with\r\n  Foreigners Act, _supra_.)\r\n\r\n_Germany._--The code of 1900 lays down rules applicable to the\r\ncelebration of all marriages within the German Empire. Civil marriage\r\nalone is recognized by the code. It is effected by the declaration of\r\nthe parties before a registrar in the presence of each other of their\r\nintention to be married. Two witnesses of full age must be present. The\r\nregistrar asks each of the parties whether he or she will many the\r\nother, and on their answer in the affirmative declares them duly married\r\nand enters the marriage in the register. The marriage must be preceded\r\nby a public notice. Marriages are void between descendants and\r\nascendants; relatives by marriage in the ascending or descending line;\r\nbrother and sister of the whole or half blood.\r\n\r\n_Other Countries._--In the great majority of the other European\r\ncountries civil marriage is obligatory. In Roman Catholic countries the\r\nparties usually supplement the obligatory civil marriage by a religious\r\nceremony, more especially since the papal decree _Ne temere_ of the 2nd\r\nof August 1907 (which came into force at Easter 1908), which requires\r\nmarriages between Roman Catholics, or between Roman Catholics and those\r\nnot professing that faith, to be celebrated before a bishop or priest\r\nduly authorized for the celebration thereof.\r\n\r\n  AUTHORITIES.--Eversley, _The Law of Domestic Relations_ (3rd ed.,\r\n  London, 1906); Lush, _The Law of Husband and Wife_ (London, 1909);\r\n  Crawley, The Law of Husband and Wife (London, 1892); Geary, _Marriage\r\n  and Family Relations_ (London, 1892); Griffiths, _Married Women's\r\n  Property Acts_ (London, 1891); Vaizley, _Law of Settlements of\r\n  Property made on Marriage_ (London, 1887); Bishop, (America)\r\n  _Marriage, Divorce and Separation_ (Chicago, 1892); David Murray,\r\n  (Scotland) _The Law relating to the Property of Married Persons_\r\n  (Glasgow, 1892); E.

Aut qui ex propria consanguinitate aliquam, aut quam\r\n    consanguineus habuit ... duceret uxorem ... incestos esse non\r\n    dubitamus (Mansi _Conc._ viii. p. 336). According to the canon law\r\n    \"affinity\" is the relation between two persons of whom one has had\r\n    commerce, licit or illicit, with a relation of the other.\r\n\r\n  [4] The civil law counts, in the direct line, as many degrees as\r\n    there are generations between the parties; e.g. the son is in regard\r\n    to his father in the 1st degree, the grandson in the 2nd, and vice\r\n    versa. In the collateral line it computes degrees by generations,\r\n    i.e. from one of the relations to the common ancestor, without\r\n    including him or her, and from him or her back to the other relation;\r\n    e.g. two brothers are in the 2nd degree of relationship to one\r\n    another, uncle and nephew in the 3rd, cousins-german in the 4th.\r\n\r\n    The canon law, which in this case derives from the old Germanic law,\r\n    has the same computation as regards the direct line. In the case of\r\n    collateral relations, however, it differs, having two rules: (1) In\r\n    the case of _equal line_--i.e. when the collaterals are equally\r\n    removed from the common progenitor, it reckons the same number of\r\n    degrees between the collaterals as between one of them and the\r\n    progenitor; e.g. brothers are related in the 1st degree, while\r\n    cousins-german are related in the 2nd degree because they are two\r\n    generations from the common grandfather. (2) In the case of _unequal\r\n    line_--i.e. when the collaterals are unequally removed from the\r\n    common ancestor, the degree of their relationship is that of the most\r\n    remote from the common progenitor; e.g. uncle and niece are related\r\n    in the 2nd degree--i.e. that of the niece to the grandfather.\r\n\r\n    The civil computation was furiously attacked by canonists as tending\r\n    to laxity (see Peter Damianus, \"De parentelae gradibus,\" in Migne,\r\n    _Patrol. Lat._ cxlv. 191, &c.).\r\n\r\n  [5] Innocent III. also decided that the husband's relations were not\r\n    related to those of the wife, and vice versa, thus establishing the\r\n    rule that \"affinity does not breed affinity\" (_affinitas non parit\r\n    affinitatem_).\r\n\r\n  [6] This is fixed by the canon law at 14 for a male, 12 for a female.\r\n    If, however, owing to the precocious physical development of a girl,\r\n    the marriage has been consummated before she has reached this age, it\r\n    cannot be nullified.\r\n\r\n  [7] It is maintained that no pope has ever given a dispensation for\r\n    such a marriage. Such a case seems, however, to be narrated by\r\n    Ordericus Vitalis (_Hist. eccles._ viii. 23; ed. A. le Prévost,\r\n    Paris, 1838-1855, t. iii. p. 408; ed. A. Duchesne, 1619, 704 B).\r\n    Robert Mowbray, earl of Northumberland, had only been married to Maud\r\n    de Laigle three months when he was condemned to perpetual\r\n    imprisonment for rebellion against King William Rufus. After\r\n    describing her forlorn state Orderic continues: \"Nec ipsa eo vivente,\r\n    secundum legem Dei, alteri nubere legitime valebat. Tandum, permissu\r\n    Paschalis Papae (II.), cui res, a curiosis enucleata, patuit, post\r\n    multos dies Nigellus de Albineo ipsam uxorem accepit.\" This may mean\r\n    no more, of course, than that the curiosi \"untied the knot\" by\r\n    discovering an impediment--the usual expedient in such cases. In any\r\n    case the fact that Nigel de Albini, in his turn, soon afterwards\r\n    obtained a \"divorce\" from her on the ground that her first husband\r\n    was his relative by consanguinity, hardly points to a strict view of\r\n    the sanctity of the marriage tie.\r\n\r\n  [8] The customary rule for more than three centuries after the\r\n    Council of Trent was that male children followed the religion of the\r\n    father, female children that of the mother. On the general subject of\r\n    the attitude of the Church towards mixed marriages see O. D. Watkins,\r\n    _Holy Matrimony_, pp. 468 et seq. For the Roman Catholic view see \"An\r\n    Instruction on Mixed Marriages\" in Bishop Ullathorne's _Eccl.\r\n    Discourses_ (London, 1876).\r\n\r\n  [9] Among the \"errors\" denounced by Pope Pius IX. in the Syllabus of\r\n    1864 is lxvi.: \"Matrimonii sacramentum non est, nisi quid contractui\r\n    accessorium ab eoque separabile, ipsumque sacramentum in una tantum\r\n    nuptiali benedictione situm est.\" This condemns the attempts of\r\n    certain canonists (e.g. Melchior Cano) to distinguish between the\r\n    _contractus naturalis_ and _sacramentalis_. This view, which was\r\n    first advanced by the jurist and theologian Johann Gropper\r\n    (1502-1559) at the council of Cologne (1536), and gained support\r\n    especially in France, makes the \"matter\" of the sacrament the consent\r\n    of the parties, the \"form\" the prayers and benedictions, the\r\n    \"minister\" the priests (see e.g. \"Du sacrament de mariage\" in vol. v.\r\n    of the _Dissertationes selectae_ of Petrus de Marca, d. 1662,\r\n    archbishop of Paris, Bamberg, 1789, p. 148).\r\n\r\n  [10] See the list of quotations from the early fathers given by\r\n    Watkins, _Holy Matrimony_, p. 93.\r\n\r\n  [11] The later teaching of the Eastern Church is laid down in the\r\n    Orthodox Confession of Peter Mogilas, patriarch of Kiev (1640). There\r\n    are three essentials for a Christian marriage: (1) suitable matter\r\n    ([Greek: ulê harmodios]), i.e. a man and woman whose union no\r\n    impediment bars, (2) a duly ordained bishop or priest, (3) the\r\n    invocation of the Holy Ghost, and the solemnity of the formularies\r\n    ([Greek: to eidos tôn logiôn]).\r\n\r\n  [12] A divorce _nisi_ does not enable the parties to marry until it\r\n    is made absolute.\r\n\r\n  [13] A marriage in which either of the parties is below the age of\r\n    consent is, however, said to be not absolutely void; if the parties\r\n    agree to continue together at the age of consent no new marriage is\r\n    necessary, but either of them may disagree and avoid the marriage.\r\n\r\n  [14] A complete list of the acts regulating the solemnization of\r\n    marriage or confirming marriages, which through some defect might be\r\n    void, will be found in Phillimore's _Ecclesiastical Law_ (2nd ed.\r\n    1895).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRUCINI, an ancient tribe which occupied a small strip of territory\r\nround about Teate (mod. Chieti), on the east coast of Italy. It is first\r\nmentioned in history as a member of a confederacy with which the Romans\r\ncame into conflict in the second Samnite War, 325 B.C., and it entered\r\nthe Roman Alliance as a separate unit at the end of that war (see\r\nfurther PAELIGNI). We know something of the language of the Marrucini\r\nfrom an inscription known as the \"Bronze of Rapino,\" which belongs to\r\nabout the middle of the 3rd century B.C. It is written in Latin\r\nalphabet, but in a dialect which belongs to the North Oscan group (see\r\nPAELIGNI). The name of the city or tribe which it gives us is _touta\r\nmarouca_, and it mentions also a citadel with the epithet _tarincris_.\r\nSeveral of its linguistic features, both in vocabulary and in syntax,\r\nare of considerable interest to the student of Latin or Italic grammar\r\n(e.g. the use of the subjunctive, without any conjunction, to express\r\npurpose, a clause prescribing a sacrifice to Ceres being followed\r\nimmediately by _pacr si ut propitia sit_). The earliest Latin\r\ninscriptions are of Ciceronian date.\r\n\r\nThe form of the name is of considerable interest, as it shows the suffix\r\n-NO- superimposed upon the suffix -CO-, a change which probably\r\nindicates some conquest of an earlier tribe by the invading Safini (or\r\nSabini, q.v.).\r\n\r\n  For further details as to Marrucine inscriptions and place-names see\r\n  R. S. Conway, _The Italic Dialects_, p. 253 seq.     (R. S. C.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRUVIUM, the chief town of the Marsi, on the E. bank of the Lacus\r\nFucinus, 4 m. S. of Cerfennia, on the Via Valeria. Though no doubt of\r\ngreat antiquity, nothing is known of its history before the imperial\r\nperiod; and none of the remains visible there (city walls, various\r\nbuildings within them, an amphitheatre, &c.), from which it seems to\r\nhave been a place of some importance, can be attributed to an earlier\r\ndate. On the site is the insignificant village of St Benedetto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARRYAT, FREDERICK (1792-1848), English sailor and novelist, was born at\r\nWestminster on the 10th of July 1792. He was the grandson of Thomas\r\nMarryat (physician, author of _The Philosophy of Masons_, and writer of\r\nverse), and son of Joseph Marryat, agent for the island of Grenada, who\r\nwrote pamphlets in defence of the Slave Trade. His mother was a\r\nBostonian of German extraction. Young Marryat distinguished himself as a\r\nboy by frequently running away to go to sea; and at last, at the age of\r\nfourteen, he was allowed to enter the navy. His first service was under\r\nLord Cochrane (afterwards tenth earl of Dundonald) in the famous\r\n\"Impérieuse,\" and no midshipman ever had a livelier apprenticeship to\r\nthe sea. During his two and a half years of service under Cochrane, the\r\nyoung midshipman witnessed more than fifty engagements, and had much\r\nexperience of service on the coast of Spain in the early stage of the\r\nPeninsular War, in the attack on the French squadron in the Roads (April\r\n1809) and in the Walcheren expedition. Before the general peace of 1815\r\nhe had served in North America and the West Indies and gained a wide\r\nknowledge of conditions of life on board ship under various commanders.\r\nIn 1815 he was promoted to the rank of commander. After holding various\r\ncommands he commissioned the \"Larne,\" 20, for the East Indies and was\r\nsenior naval officer at Rangoon during the Burmese War from May to\r\nSeptember 1824. In the early part of the next year he commanded an\r\nexpedition up the Bassein River, in which Bassein was occupied and the\r\nBurmese stores seized. His services were acknowledged by a nomination as\r\nC.B. in 1826. He frequently received honourable mention for his\r\nbehaviour in action, and in 1818 he received the medal of the Humane\r\nSociety for \"at least a dozen\" gallant rescues. Marryat's honours were\r\nnot confined to gallant exploits. He adapted Sir Home Popham's code of\r\nsignals to a code for the Mercantile Marine, for which he was made\r\nF.R.S. in 1819, and received the Legion of Honour from Louis Philippe in\r\n1833. A pamphlet written to propose a substitute for the system of\r\nimpressment in 1822 is said to have offended King William IV.\r\n\r\nMarryat brought ripe experience and unimpaired vivacity to his work when\r\nhe began to write novels. _Frank Mildmay, or the Naval Officer_, was\r\npublished in 1829, and _The King's Own_ followed in 1830. The novels of\r\nthe sea captain at once won public favour. The freshness of the new\r\nfield which was opened up to the imagination--so full of vivid lights\r\nand shadows, light-hearted fun, grinding hardship, stirring adventure,\r\nheroic action, warm friendships, bitter hatreds--was in exhilarating\r\ncontrast to the world of the historical romancer and the fashionable\r\nnovelist, to which the mind of the general reader was at that date given\r\nover. He had an admirable gift of lucid, direct narrative, and an\r\nunfailing fund of incident, and of humour, sometimes bordering on farce.\r\nOf all his portraits of adventurous sailors, \"Gentleman Chucks\" in\r\n_Peter Simple_ and \"Equality Jack\" in _Mr Midshipman Easy_ are the most\r\nfamous, but he created many other types which take rank among the\r\ncharacteristic figures in English fiction. Marryat's first attempt was\r\nsomewhat severely criticized from an artistic point of view, and he was\r\naccused of gratifying private grudges by introducing real personages too\r\nthinly disguised; and as he attributed some of his own adventures to\r\nFrank Mildmay he was rather shocked to learn that readers identified him\r\nwith that disagreeable character. _The King's Own_ was a vast\r\nimprovement, in point of construction, upon _Frank Mildmay_; and he went\r\non, through a quick succession of tales, _Newton Forster_ (1832), _Peter\r\nSimple_ (1834), _Jacob Faithful_ (1834), _The Pacha of Many Tales_\r\n(1835), _Japhet in Search of a Father_ (1836), _Mr Midshipman Easy_\r\n(1836), _The Pirate and the Three Cutters_ (1836), till he reached his\r\nhigh-water mark of constructive skill in _Snarley-yow, or the Dog Fiend_\r\n(1837). The best of his books after this date are those written\r\nexpressly for boys, the favourites being _Masterman Ready_ (1841), _The\r\nSettlers in Canada_ (1844), and _The Children of the New Forest _(1847).\r\nAmong his other works are _The Phantom Ship_ (1839); _A Diary in\r\nAmerica_ (1839); _Olla Podrida_ (1840), a collection of miscellaneous\r\npapers; _Poor Jack_ (1840); _Joseph Rushbrook_ (1841); _Percival Keene_\r\n(1842); _Monsieur Violet_ (1842); _The Privateer's Man_ (1844); _The\r\nMission, or Scenes in Africa_ (1845); _The Little Savage_ (1848-1849),\r\npublished posthumously; and _Valerie_, not completed (1849). His novels\r\nform an important link between Smollett and Fielding and Charles\r\nDickens.\r\n\r\nCaptain Marryat had retired from the naval service in 1830, becoming\r\nequerry to the duke of Sussex. He edited the _Metropolitan Magazine_\r\nfrom 1832 to 1835, and some of his best stories appeared in that paper.\r\nHe spent a great part of his time in Brussels, where he was very\r\npopular. He visited Canada during Papineau's revolt and the United\r\nStates in 1837, and gave a disparaging account of American institutions\r\nin a _Diary_ published on his return to England. While at New York he\r\nwrote a play, _The Ocean Waif, or Channel Outlaw_, which was acted, and\r\nis forgotten. His versatility is further shown by the fact that he drew\r\nrough caricatures and other sketches with some spirit. Some capital\r\nsnatches of verse are scattered throughout his novels, the best being\r\n\"Poll put her arms akimbo\" in _Snarley-yow_, and the \"Hunter and the\r\nMaid\" in _Poor Jack_. In 1843 he settled at Langham Manor, Norfolk. He\r\nindulged in costly experiments in farming, so that in spite of the large\r\nincome earned by his books he was not a rich man. He died at Langham on\r\nthe 9th of August 1848, his death being hastened by news of the loss of\r\nhis son by shipwreck.\r\n\r\n  His daughter, Florence Marryat, herself a novelist, published his Life\r\n  and Letters in 1872. See also David Hannay, _Life of Marryat_ (1889).\r\n       (D. H.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS, MLLE [ANNE FRANÇOISE HYPPOLYTE BOUTET] (1779-1847), French\r\nactress, was born in Paris on the 9th of February 1779, the natural\r\ndaughter of the actor-author named Monvel [Jacques Marie Boutet,\r\n1745-1812], and Mlle Mars Salvetat, an actress whose southern accent had\r\nmade her Paris _début_ a failure. Mlle Mars began her stage career in\r\nchildren's parts, and by 1799, after the rehabilitation of the Comédie\r\nFrançaise, she and her sister (Mars _aînée_) joined that company, of\r\nwhich she remained an active member for thirty-three years. Her beauty\r\nand talents soon placed her at the top of her profession. She was\r\nincomparable in _ingénue_ parts, and equally charming as the coquette.\r\nMolière, Marivaux, Sedaine, and Beaumarchais had no more accomplished\r\ninterpreter, and in her career of half a century, besides many comedy\r\nrôles of the older _répertoire_, she created fully a hundred parts in\r\nplays which owed success largely to her. For her farewell performance\r\nshe selected Elmire in _Tartuffe_, and Silvia in _Jeu de l'amour et du\r\nhasard_, two of her most popular rôles; and for her benefit, a few days\r\nafter, Célimène in _Le Misanthrope_ and Araminthe in _Les Femmes\r\nsavantes_. She retired in 1841, and died in Paris on the 20th of March\r\n1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARS (MAVORS, MARMAR, MARSPITER OR MASPITER), after Jupiter the most\r\nimportant deity of the Roman state, and one who, unlike most Roman\r\ndeities, was never so much affected by foreign influences as to lose his\r\nessentially Roman and Italian character. Traces of his worship are found\r\nin all parts of central and southern Italy, in Umbria, Picenum, Samnium,\r\nand in one or two Etruscan cities, as well as in Latium; and in several\r\ncommunities, as we learn from Ovid (_Fasti_, 3.93 seq.), he gave his\r\nname to a month, as at Rome to the first month of the old Roman year. We\r\nknow little of the character of his cult except at Rome, and even at\r\nRome it has been variously interpreted. He has been explained as a\r\nsun-god, a god of wind and storm, a god of the year and a god of\r\nvegetation; and he has been compared with Apollo by Roscher (_Apollo,\r\nand Mars_, 1873, and in the article \"Mars\" in his _Lexicon of\r\nMythology_). But in historical times his chief function at Rome was to\r\nprotect the state in war, and it is as a god of war that he is known to\r\nall readers of Roman literature. So entirely did this characteristic get\r\nthe better of all others, that his name came to be used as a synonym for\r\n_bellum_; and in the latest and most careful of all accounts of the\r\nRoman religion he is pronounced to have been from first to last a god of\r\nwar only (see Wissowa, _Religion und Kultus der Römer_, p. 129 seq.).\r\n\r\nUntil the time of Augustus Mars had but two temples at Rome, and both\r\nare connected with warlike operations. One of these was originally only\r\nan altar; it was in the Campus Martius, the exercising-ground of the\r\narmy. The other was outside the Porta Capena, the gate through which the\r\narmy marched on its way to campaigns to the south: here too each year\r\nthe Equites met in order to start in procession through the city (_Dion.\r\nHal._ 6. 13). Each of these sites was outside the _pomerium_, and this\r\nhas been explained to mean that the war-god \"must be kept at a distance\"\r\n(Carter, _Religion of Numa_, p. 19). But in the heart of the city there\r\nwas a _sacrarium_ of Mars in the _regia_, originally the king's house,\r\nin which the sacred spears of Mars were kept, and the fact that on the\r\noutbreak of war the consul had to shake these spears, saying as he did\r\nit, _Mars vigila_ (\"Mars, wake up!\"), shows that the god was believed to\r\nreside here in some spiritual sense. If the spears moved of themselves,\r\nthe omen was bad and called for expiation. The _ancilia_, or sacred\r\nshields, also formed part of this symbolic armoury of the Roman state:\r\nthey were carried in procession by the Salii (q.v.) or dancing\r\nwarrior-priests of Mars on several occasions during the month of March\r\nup to the 23rd (_tubilustrium_), when the military trumpets (_tubae_)\r\nwere lustrated: and again in October to the 19th (_armilustrium_), when\r\nboth the _ancilia_ and the arms of the exercitus were purified and put\r\naway for the winter. During the four months of the Italian winter the\r\nworship of Mars seems at a standstill: we have no trace of it in the\r\ncalendar or in Roman literature. His activity is all in the warm season,\r\ni.e. in the season of warfare. It is only at the end of February that we\r\nfind indications of the coming force of the Mars-cult in the month which\r\nbears his name: Quirinus, who was probably the Mars of the community\r\nsettled on the Quirinal Hill, and had his twelve Salii corresponding to\r\nthose of the Palatine Mars, held his festival on the 17th of February,\r\nand on the 27th was the first festival called Equirria, the second being\r\non the 14th of March. The name indicates horse-racing; horses were bred\r\nand used at Rome chiefly for military purposes, and it is possible to\r\nsee here, as in the Equirria of the 14th of March, which we know was a\r\nfestival of Mars (W. W. Fowler, _Roman Festivals_, p. 44), an exercise\r\nof the war-horses, accompanied with sacrifice to Mars, preparatory to\r\nthe opening of the season of arms.\r\n\r\nThere is thus abundant evidence, based on the ancient calendars and the\r\nfeatures of the cult, that Mars was all along a deity especially\r\nconnected with warfare; and it is hardly necessary to add proof of a\r\nless convincing kind, e.g. that the wolf, his special animal, is a\r\nwarlike beast, or that Nerio, a female deity who may anciently have been\r\ncoupled with him, seems to be etymologically \"the strong one,\" or that\r\nhe is in legend the father of Romulus the warlike king and founder of\r\nthe Roman army, as compared with Numa, who instituted the Roman law and\r\nreligion. Enough has been said to show why Mars should have become\r\nexclusively a god of war, even if the Roman state in its advance in the\r\nconquest of other peoples had not given a continual impulse to this\r\naspect of the cult. In founding his famous temple of Mars Ultor (the\r\navenger of Caesar) in the Forum Augusti, Augustus gave a new turn to\r\nthis worship, and for a time it seems to have been a rival of that of\r\nthe Capitoline Jupiter (see Carter, _Religion of Numa_, p. 174 seq.),\r\nand late in the period of the empire Mars became the most prominent of\r\nthe _di militares_ worshipped by the Roman legions.\r\n\r\nThere are however certain features in the Mars cult which make it\r\nprobable that this god was not entirely warlike in character. He seems,\r\nin early times, at least, to have been also associated with agriculture;\r\nand this is in harmony with the facts: (1) that the season of arms is\r\nalso the season of the growth, ripening and harvesting of the crops; (2)\r\nthat the early Roman community was an agricultural as well as a military\r\none, as is indicated in its religious calendar (Fowler, _Roman\r\nFestivals_, p. 334). Thus Mars was invoked in the ancient hymn of the\r\nArval Brothers, whose religious duties had as their object to keep off\r\nenemies of all kinds from crops and herds (Henzen, _Acta Fratr. Arv._ p.\r\n26, 1874; Wordsworth, _Fragments_ and _Specimens of Early Latin_, p. 385\r\nseq.); and his association here with the Lares (q.v.) proves that he is\r\nnot regarded as a war-god who could avert the raid of an enemy. Still\r\nmore striking is the invocation of Mars (with the cult-title Silvanus)\r\nin the yearly lustration of his land by the Roman farmer (Cato, _De re\r\nrustica_, 141), where it is not a human enemy, but disease, and all\r\nunwholesome influences, which the god is besought to avert from the farm\r\nand land, plantations and flocks. Three times the procession went round\r\nthe land, reciting prayers and driving the victims to be sacrificed,\r\nviz. ox, sheep and pig (_suovetaurilia_), representing the farmer's most\r\nvaluable stock. We can hardly doubt that in the state ceremony of the\r\nAmbarvalia, i.e. the _lustratio_ of the ager romanus in its earliest\r\nform, the same god was invoked and the same ritual used (Fowler, _op.\r\ncit._ p. 124 seq.). Again in the curious ritual of the sacrifice to Mars\r\nof the October horse (Oct. 15: Fowler _op. cit._ 241), though the animal\r\nwas undoubtedly a war-horse, the head was cut off and decked with cakes,\r\nas we are told (Paul. Diac. 220) _ob frugum eventum_. Even Quirinus, the\r\nform of Mars worshipped in the Quirinal community, is not without an\r\nassociation with agricultural perils, for it was his _flamen_ who\r\nsacrificed the victims at the Robigalia on the 25th of April, when the\r\nspirit of the mildew (robigus) was invoked to spare the corn (Ovid,\r\n_Fasti_, 4. 901 seq.).\r\n\r\nWar and agriculture are thus the two factors of human life and\r\nexperience which are unquestionably prominent in the cult of Mars, and\r\nexplain his importance in a community like that of Rome: and there is no\r\nneed, in a short account of this religious conception, to determine\r\nwhether he was by origin a solar deity, a storm-god, or a\r\nvegetation-spirit. His name gives us no help, its etymology is uncertain\r\n(Roscher in _Mythological Lexicon_, s.v. \"Mars,\" p. 2436). But we are\r\nsafe in conjecturing that Mars first came into prominence among the\r\nLatins and kindred peoples in the course of their long struggle for\r\nsettlements among the mountains and forests of Italy. The clearing of\r\nprimeval woodland, the perils of agriculture from the raids of enemies\r\nand of wild beasts, and from the ravages of disease, are all indicated\r\nin the later Mars cult. The wolf and the woodpecker, denizens of the\r\nforest, always remained his sacred animals, and were believed in Italian\r\nlegend to have led the Piceni and Hirpini to their places of settlement.\r\nMars is specially associated with the early foundation legends of Italy,\r\nas was the case at Rome: and it was to him that the _ver sacrum_ was\r\ndedicated, i.e. the entire produce of a spring, including the children\r\nborn then, who were eventually driven forth from their homes to form new\r\nsettlements elsewhere (Roscher in _Lex. Myth._ 2411). The fierce\r\ncharacter of the god, gained no doubt in this period of struggle and\r\ndanger, never entirely left him. Even in the hymn of the Fratres Arvales\r\nhe is the \"fierce Mars\" (_fere Mars_), and in the prayer of Cato's\r\nfarmer, though he has become \"Father Mars,\" he is Silvanus (q.v.), the\r\ndweller in the woodland which surrounded the agricultural clearing.\r\n\r\n  See Roscher in _Myth.
