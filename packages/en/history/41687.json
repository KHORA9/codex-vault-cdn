How cold is all history, how lifeless all\r\nimagery, compared to that which the living nation writes and the\r\nuncorrupted marble bears. There are but two strong conquerors of the\r\nforgetfulness of men, Poetry and Architecture, and the latter in some\r\nsort includes the former, and is mightier in its reality; it is well to\r\nhave, not only what men have thought and felt, but what their hands have\r\nhandled and their strength wrought and their eyes beheld, all the days\r\nof their life.\"[1]\r\n\r\nSo wrote John Ruskin in one of his flashes of genius, and never was word\r\ntruer. Architecture is the living voice of the past. Architecture is\r\nhistory. By architecture the forefathers from whom we come relate to us\r\ntheir progress in knowledge, their prowess in handicrafts, their\r\neconomic conditions, their sorrows, their rejoicings, their aspirations.\r\nThey wrote it down, those men and women whose blood is our blood, on\r\ngreat stone pages of perennial beauty for us to read--_if only we\r\nwould_. By architecture we are linked in a grand solidarity with all\r\nthat has gone before, with the proud periods of history that thrill us\r\nas we read, and with the tragic outbreaks of the oppressed that sadden\r\nour spirit.\r\n\r\nWhenever men have set themselves to forget this solidarity, their first\r\nact has been to fling themselves in frenzy on cathedral and city hall.\r\nIn 1914 they forgot it, and mighty Rheims fell. They forgot that Bamburg\r\nhad learned its imagery from Rheims, that German Norbert, revered of St.\r\nBernard, had helped France in the days when Gothic art was in formation,\r\nthat he died bishop of Magdeburg, and Magdeburg is a Primary Gothic\r\ncathedral in the land which frankly called the new architecture _opus\r\nfrancigenum_. Would the civic halls of Noyon, Arras, St. Quentin, and\r\nYpres lie in ruins if Frankfort and Lübeck had remembered?\r\n\r\nIn 1793, man again thought to set up a barrier between himself and his\r\npast, and he shattered the art treasures of a thousand years and tore\r\ndown the cathedrals of Cambrai, Arras, and Avranches; he tore down\r\nCluny, the greatest Romanesque church in the world, Cluny the civilizer,\r\nthat had removed from agriculture its stigma as serfs' work. Man fancied\r\nthat to shatter and demolish was to build.\r\n\r\nAgain in 1562, a date most tragic in the annals of Gothic architecture,\r\nmen tried again to rear a wall of hate between themselves and the\r\ngenerations gone before, and the cathedral of Orléans met the fate of\r\nCluny and Cambrai, and from end to end of France images were\r\ndecapitated, and ancestors' tombs wrecked impiously--even the tombs of\r\nspiritual ancestors who with painful journeyings afoot had brought the\r\ngospel light. Whether you go to chapel or to temple to-day, to\r\nmeetinghouse or to cathedral, whether you worship under the open sky, be\r\nyou a reader of Marx or of Aquinas, you were robbed most piteously of\r\nyour patrimony in 1562, in 1793, in 1914.\r\n\r\nHow is it to be prevented again? By trying to make the monuments of the\r\npast loved, by relating the tale of their building, by telling the life\r\nstory of the builders. If we know them we must surely revere them, and\r\nwhen we have learned to know and to love, we have learned to be liberal.\r\nArchæology is _to teach us to remember_. Those who have gone before have\r\npassed on to us cathedral and town hall; it is our obligation to\r\ntransmit them intact to those who come after. They are not ours to\r\ndestroy. Art is the high-water mark reached by civilization; art does\r\nnot speak in English, or in German, or in the Latin tongue, but in a\r\nlanguage understood of all peoples and all times. To destroy a great\r\nmonument of the past is to betray civilization. It was proved in 1914\r\nthat erudition is not safeguard enough, nor is enthusiasm, sighs 1793,\r\nnor purpose to reform, admits 1562. We must comprehend intelligently our\r\nown personal solidarity with the past. We must never look at a noble\r\nbuilding without proudly realizing that we had a hand in its making.\r\nBattles then can rage around cathedrals without danger of their\r\ndestruction. As in golden amber, the past will preserve them, the past\r\nwhich is yours and mine and everyone's heritage.\r\n\r\nIt is a right instinct which makes a man treasure the home he has had\r\ntransmitted to him through several generations. How much more--when\r\nloyalty is roused by an XVIII-century or a XVII-century\r\nhabitation--should emotion be felt for what was reared from 1140 to 1270\r\nby the very generations who began for us of to-day most of the big\r\nthings we value: our universities, our literature, our political\r\nfreedom, our prosperous trade.\r\n\r\nNow in the making of these infinitely precious things, France played the\r\nleading role. Put partisan feeling aside and acknowledge it honestly. \"I\r\nbelieve,\" said Ruskin, in a lecture at Edinburgh, in 1853, even before\r\nthe new science of mediæval archæology was formulated, \"that the French\r\nnation in the XII and XIII centuries was the greatest nation in the\r\nworld, and that the French not only invented Gothic architecture, but\r\ncarried it to its noblest developments.\"\r\n\r\nFrench Gothic churches are a fountainhead, and should rank first.\r\nBecause of them we have Westminster, Ely, and Lincoln, we had Tintern,\r\nMelrose, Mellifont, Holycross. They built the Burgos, Toledo, León,\r\nSeville, and Belem, which have given wings to the soul of the Peninsula.\r\nBecause of the French cathedrals we have Cologne, Magdeburg, and\r\nHalberstadt, Vienna, Prague, Upsala, Siena, Florence, and Milan.\r\n\r\nBy her lyrics, her epics, and her architecture, France was the\r\ninspiration of Europe in the XII and XIII centuries. With his sword, the\r\ncrusader carried compass and rule. Those indefatigable wanderers, Cluny,\r\nCîteaux, and the men of Prémontré and Chartreuse carried with them the\r\nchisel and the Book. Then as now the commercial traveler was a valiant\r\npropagandist; in 1181 a cloth merchant of Assisi, returned from trading\r\nin France, where he had seen the cathedral of Lyons rising, or perhaps\r\nthat of Paris, or that of Poitiers, and he had passed under wonderful\r\nnew-imaged portals in the Midi and in Burgundy; so, in memory of\r\nbeautiful things, he chose to call the son born to him, Francis, and the\r\nboy grew up to love and to chant the lyrics of France and named himself\r\n\"God's little troubadour.\"\r\n\r\nBackward and forward has moved the ebb and flow of races and their arts.\r\nWhen Celts from conquered Britain passed over to Armorica they carried\r\nwith them the Arthurian cycle; Teutonic tribes, strong in bone and\r\ntissue, poured into Gaul a very avalanche; masterful Norsemen populated\r\nthe seacoasts; and before the recording of time the Oriental and the\r\nLatin had made their home in the land between the northern seas and the\r\nbig inland water of commerce. Does such history seem too remote to be of\r\nemotional value? Are personalities lacking? Not so in the missionary\r\ndays of Columbanus and Benedict, first hewers of the cathedrals'\r\nfoundation blocks, for never came a great movement of building activity\r\nthat did not tread in the steps of spiritual regeneration. Your\r\nforefathers and my forefathers came into France to help her, to bring\r\nher art and letters in her dark hour. They came to teach and they came\r\nto learn, to succor and to find refuge. They came in the persons of\r\nCeltic Columbanus, Brieuc, Malo, Fiacre, Malachy, and holy Laurence\r\nburied at Eu, as English Alcuin, Stephen Harding, John of Salisbury, and\r\nSaint Edmund Rich buried at Pontigny. They came as German Radegund and\r\nthe saintly Bruno and Norbert, as Italian Benedict, Fortunatus,\r\nHildebrand, William of Volpiano, Lanfranc, Anselm, Aquinas, and\r\nBonaventure, as Spanish Dominic, and Portuguese Anthony. They came from\r\nEgypt with Maurice and his Thebans, from the Levant with Irenæus and\r\nGiles, from Hungary with Martin the soldier. And the story of each one\r\nof them is recorded in the churches that stand in France to-day. Without\r\narchitecture we would have forgotten them.\r\n\r\nWith the ebbing and flowing of the tide in the affairs of men, a day\r\narrived when the big people and the little people of Normandy, Poitou,\r\nAnjou, and Flanders passed in large numbers into Great Britain and\r\nIreland in the wake of the Conqueror and of Henry Plantagenet, so that\r\nthe very names we bear are those of the cathedral builders.\r\n\r\nWho has not watched the widening ripples of water spread from a center?\r\nEven so is each one of us a center whence in ever-widening circles\r\nstretch out our progenitors, embracing more and more men, more and more\r\nwomen, rippling over the pitiful barricades of 1793, sweeping over the\r\nfactions of 1562, till by the time the widening ripple has reached the\r\nage of St. Louis, the age of Suger, it is scientifically impossible that\r\nwe, in our very own forefathers, were not building some of the eighty\r\ncathedrals and three hundred great minsters with which France was then\r\nclothing herself as with a white mantle of churches. We were chatelaine,\r\nand burgher's wife, we were villein's daughter and knight's son, and\r\nside by side we harnessed ourselves to carts and dragged in the blocks\r\nfor the tower at Chartres and the belfry at Rouen, and the canticles we\r\nsang during our voluntary servitude passed into the stones and are still\r\nchanting there--_if only we would listen_. No visionary notion this, but\r\nscience and history. By architecture we remember.\r\n\r\nOf our kin was the bishop who sacrificed his revenue to rear God's\r\nhouse. Of our kin were the architects, masters of the living stone, who\r\nwith inspiration conceived their shrines of Notre Dame and were trained\r\nsoundly enough in mason craft to achieve their dreams; of our kin were\r\nthe artisans who put up the serene images at cathedral doors for the\r\nedification of the people, and chiseled with warm, loving touches the\r\nrunning bramble of the roadside. Even botany is to be learned in\r\nmediæval cathedrals. Not a leaf that grows in Champagne to-day but was\r\ncarved on the walls of Rheims seven hundred years ago. Against the big\r\ncapitals of Paris Cathedral they laid the broad plantain leaf of the\r\nmarshy Oise, then, seeing around them that indigenous acanthus, the\r\nuncurling fern, they carved it, too, and as they grew adept with chisel\r\nthey wrought ivy and vine leaf, parsley and holly, and in time,\r\nintoxicated with their skill, they undercut the rich foliage and\r\nserrated the lobes and curled the leaf edges, till summer ran riot in\r\nstone and the architectural line was well-nigh lost sight of in sheer\r\njoy of nature's glad livery.\r\n\r\nThe cathedrals of France are an enduring appeal to man's high faculty of\r\nimagination. In them we go crusading again. We scale the walls of\r\nConstantinople with doughty Bishop Nivelon, builder of Soissons\r\nCathedral, we are ransomed from Saracen captivity with Bishop Albéric,\r\nbuilder of Rheims. We repent of our black feudal deeds with Fulk Nerra,\r\nand when we have finished our footsore penances in Holy Land, we punish\r\nourselves in our purses, raising costly abbeys in Anjou and Touraine. On\r\nour Eastern pilgrimage we have seen visions of Oriental color, and,\r\nremembering them, we lighten our sober churches of the north with\r\ntranslucent mosaic tapestries. We dot our Western land with circular\r\nHoly Sepulcher temples. It is said that Suger, builder of the first\r\ngreat Gothic church in the world, maker of jeweled windows over which\r\nscience sighs in despair of emulation, used eagerly to inquire of\r\ntravelers returned from the East had they seen aught, even in St. Sophia\r\nitself, to surpass his St. Denis'. We are rightly sure that our new art\r\nsurpasses all others. We may borrow, but our borrowings are creations.\r\n\r\nBy architecture in happy promiscuity we crowd to the international fairs\r\nof Champagne. We elbow and we jostle to see what our diligent brothers,\r\nthe art-loving Flemish burghers, have brought for exchange, or what\r\nthings beautiful the merchants from south of the Alps have to barter.\r\nTo-day, at Troyes, we are astounded by the gathering of art treasures\r\nin that lesser-known city, and we wonder at the mighty rampart walls at\r\nProvins. _Then we remember._ It is architecture that will not let us\r\nforget what efficient traders we were in the XIII century.\r\n\r\nBy architecture we are Benedictines at Cluny, white monks at Fontenay,\r\nof Prémontré at Braine. Again we pace in meditative cloisters, we tuck\r\nup our robes to delve in mother earth to make the desert bloom, we\r\nillumine parchment pages, we teach the plain-chant to children, we cast\r\nbells, each with its own entity, each a living voice for the people,\r\nnamed with its own name.\r\n\r\nBy architecture we are one of the thousands athirst for knowledge, who\r\ngather at the feet of abstruse debaters in the schools of Bec, Auxerre,\r\nRheims, Orléans, Laon, Chartres and Paris, king's son seated on the\r\nrush-strewn pavements next to peasant's son, both equally convinced that\r\nthe most thrilling of all sciences are philosophy and theology. Books\r\nare scarce; as yet no printing press; we must wander far to gather\r\ncrumbs of learning; our strong young brains are intact, prepared for\r\nservice by long ages of active bone and muscle; with avidity we seize on\r\nproblems so knotty that the learned ones of 1920 fear to touch them.\r\n\"The time of big theories is the time of big results.\" It is we, in the\r\nperson of the Scholastics who built Paris Cathedral, and Laon, the\r\nintellectual,--churches disciplined, sober and strong. It is we the\r\nmultitudinous scholars of the Middle Ages who built Chartres, the wise\r\nmystic, and opalescent Auxerre, and Châlons on the Marne of Victory. And\r\nlest the hungry generations tread us down, we inscribed our loved\r\nsubtleties on their walls, and at their portals placed images of the\r\nLiberal Arts.\r\n\r\nBy architecture we join one side or the other in the eternal struggle of\r\nMight and Right. Sometimes in atonement we spend the revenues secured by\r\nheedless Might on minster or cathedral. By pain and struggle we have won\r\nour city charter, and we are proud to record in God's sight and man's\r\nwhat thrifty burgesses we are, what trained journeymen. To work is to\r\npray, say the cathedral windows set up by furriers, butchers, vintagers,\r\nand farm laborers. To work is as fine a thing as to fight at Roncevaux\r\nand Mansurah, as did our next-door donor neighbor here. The little\r\npeople of the Lord are as grateful in his sight as the noble\r\n_prud'hommes_. _Le bon Dieu_ likes to be shown how a tailor cuts his\r\ncloth and a baker bakes his bread just as well as to be entertained with\r\npilgrimage adventures or the story of a canonized saint. Are we not\r\nsaints in the making if only we can get the better of that prowling\r\nfelon, the devil, whom we have set up over our church door with\r\npitchfork and caldron as a warning to the unwary?\r\n\r\n\"O men and women of to-day\"--appeal the windows at Chartres and Bourges\r\nand Tours--\"you whose blood is our blood, who without our struggle would\r\nhave no ordered government, no self-ruling cities, no trade to bind land\r\nwith land in the sanity of peace, no arts and crafts, why not learn to\r\nread our story? There are those unable to decipher a line of our\r\nillumined pages who will assure you that we were sunk in gross\r\nsuperstition, that our sole religion was the worship of bits of cloth\r\nand bone. Yes, even from the halls founded by good Robert de Sorbon (in\r\norder that youth with its lean purse might get a free education) the\r\nerudites marshal against us every human frailty of our hardy,\r\nenterprising times. And yet, in unparalleled marvels of stone and glass\r\nwe have recorded the deepest sentiments of mankind. But having eyes,\r\nthey see not. Come then, you, and interpret us. Come, and through us,\r\n_remember_.\"\r\n\r\nEach great cathedral is pleading to us by the alluring half-smile of its\r\nangels, by the dignified images of reverent personages at its entrances,\r\nby each gargoyle, each faithful guardian that has craned his neck for\r\nages to keep rain water from the precious walls. Cease to be so superior\r\nto the legends and dreams we set forth, they seem to be saying. We know\r\njust as well as you that the apostle St. Thomas did not have all the\r\nadventures raising fairy palaces in India which we put to his credit in\r\nour windows and tympanums, even though good Bishop James of Voragine, in\r\nhis cycle of church feasts, our iconographic chart--_Legenda\r\nAurea_--relates it. The holy Jerome, close to the desert and the origin\r\nof things, real and apocryphal, warned us not to be too credulous. But\r\nsymbols and legends are the breath of art, as art alone realizes through\r\nexpression, the supersensual visions of mankind. Are there not millions\r\nof good Christian folk in India to-day? Her first evangelist builded\r\nbetter than ever we can relate by our imagery.\r\n\r\nWe are not at all dull, plead the waiting cathedrals. Encyclopædias they\r\ncall us. Yes, we had our little weakness for symmetry, for the mystic\r\nbeauty of numbers, for gathering into \"Mirrors\" all the knowledge of the\r\nworld. But how admirable is our Mirror of Morals, with virtues and vices\r\ncontrasted; how interesting our Mirrors of Nature and of History that\r\ntell the story from Genesis to Revelations, and that set the marvels of\r\nthe skies and man's dumb fellow creatures, the beasts, side by side on\r\nthe walls of the house of worship, with David and Isaias, St. Peter and\r\nSt. Paul, Charlemagne and Louis. And our Mirror of Knowledge--how\r\nprofound it is: not as enemies but as allies would it show forth science\r\nand religion. We are no more dull than the Bible is dull, than the\r\n_Divina Commedia_ is dull. We satisfy the subtlest intellects; alike the\r\nlettered and the unlettered enjoy us.\r\n\r\nEach French cathedral and each minster makes its own special plea. Lyons\r\nreminds us, in windows of apocalyptic radiance, that her first bishops\r\ncame from John the Apostle, that Christian blood flowed in her forum as\r\ngenerously as in Rome's Coliseum. Of the very stones of the\r\nAmphitheater, hallowed by her martyrs, is her cathedral built, and the\r\narchitectural methods of the north and the south are welded here in the\r\nancient central city of Gaul whence rayed out the linking highroads of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nAt Tours, the charity of Martin to a beggar is recorded many a time, for\r\nit civilized middle Europe. Slow, steady, and deep were the\r\naccumulations of culture by the Loire of measured horizons and classic\r\nrestraint. A tower named of Charlemagne recalls that Saxon Alcuin filled\r\nthe schoolrooms of St. Martin's Abbey. A chiseled tomb reminds us that\r\nhere worked the last sculptor of the Middle Ages (loyal to its humble\r\nand profound Christian traditions), as well as the first artists of the\r\nimported pagan Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAt Le Mans and Angers, at Fontevrault, with its tomb of Henry\r\nPlantagenet, who gave us our jury system, speak those fighting\r\nprogressives, the Angevin rulers; and all their love of the arts and of\r\nadventure endures in the exotically beautiful development which we call\r\nPlantagenet Gothic. An unlettered king is an uncrowned ass, said a\r\nX-century count of Anjou.\r\n\r\nAt Poitiers, city of St. Hilaire who fought the Arians, is the most\r\nglorious window in the world--Christ triumphant on the Cross, and again\r\nwe walk in procession to the strain of Bishop Fortunatus' hymn, and we\r\nread the Church Fathers in Greek and Hebrew in Queen Radegund's\r\ncloister. Aquitaine's line of troubadour dukes, passionate sinners, and\r\nprodigious repenters lives in every church in the old hill city, from\r\nthe cathedral wherein Aliénor blended the indigenous art of her own\r\nPoitou with the Plantagenet suppleness of her Angevin husband, to the\r\ncupola-covered abbatial of St. Hilaire, where her son, Richard the\r\nLion-hearted, was installed as duke.\r\n\r\nAt Caen we live with the Conqueror and Matilda in their penitential\r\nabbey-churches, full of thought and purpose, the architecture of\r\nhieratic pre-eminence which Normandy passed on to England. At Coutances,\r\nthe cathedral walls record the Tancreds, so the people say; close by was\r\nthe eyrie of that eagle brood who set up kingdoms in Italy and the\r\nOrient. At Rouen we mutter with the crowd in the market place that a\r\ngrievous shame it is to burn a saint as a witch, and in reaction, soon\r\nwe are to rear monuments whose every line is jubilant freedom. At Rheims\r\nwe are crowned kings in a cathedral so sumptuous that on coronation days\r\nit needed no tapestries to adorn its walls. At Clermont and at Vézelay\r\nwe don the crusaders' insignia with cries of enthusiasm. The lavish art\r\nof Bourges tells of Jacques Coeur's largess, the princely merchant who\r\nfinanced the army that rid France of her invaders, just as clearly as\r\nthe ducal tombs and imagery at Dijon relate the pageantry of the\r\nXV-century Burgundian life. The stones of Pontigny tell of Becket the\r\nmartyr, whose cause impassioned all Christendom, as many a sculptured\r\ngroup and storied window in France relate, and of another great\r\nEnglishman, Stephen Langton, who passed from this cloistral\r\npeace--dividing the Bible into chapters for us--to the Magna Charta\r\nstruggle in England. _By architecture we remember._\r\n\r\nUntil we have seen Albi's aggressive fortress-church what do we really\r\nknow of the Albigensian heresy, of the disease un-European,\r\nantichristian, antisocial, that bred in the precocious civilization of\r\nLanguedoc? What do we know of that terrible struggle called a crusade,\r\nwhen the greedy barons of the north descended on the Midi (ever brutal\r\nand refined), thinking to cure its soul by the sword and with the same\r\nblows to carve out for themselves rich principalities? Forever is the\r\nstory told in the Jacobins' church at Toulouse, in the red cathedral\r\nfortress above the Tarn.\r\n\r\nAll the isolating pride of feudalism is resumed in the ramparts of\r\nCarcassonne and Aigues-Mortes, all the frustrated destiny of Narbonne in\r\nits vast fragment of a cathedral, all the unbroken links with the Latin\r\nare in the sculpture at Arles and St. Gilles, all the immemorial story\r\nof _la grande bleu_ in Maguelonne's solitary church. _By architecture we\r\nremember._\r\n\r\nThe Celtic remnant, that in the volcanic-torn uplands of middle France\r\ninflicted on Cæsar his sole defeat, lives always in the churches of\r\nAuvergne, so stubbornly indigenous, planted so sturdily, contriving\r\ndecorative beauty from the regional varicolored lava stones. In the\r\ngranite churches of Brittany endures all the aloof individuality, the\r\nsensitive independence, the tenacious traditionalism of the dwellers by\r\nthe sea in the far-north outpost of France. We have our souls to keep,\r\nsay the lowly Breton shrines, we have always been too busy doing that\r\nto find time to erect great churches. But once our neighbors, the\r\nNormans, taught us tower-building, our Celtic imagination leaped _au\r\ndelà_ by their spires, so we raised our royal Kreisker which far out to\r\nsea welcomes home our Breton sailors.\r\n\r\nArchitecture is history. Architecture is what the old Greeks said of\r\nhistory, \"philosophy teaching by examples.\" The cathedrals of France\r\nprove that there is no supreme architecture where there is not liberty\r\nor the will to attain it. In 1109 the bishop-baron of Noyon granted his\r\ncity a charter, the first communal written laws on record. In 1145 Noyon\r\nbegan to build the first Gothic cathedral of France. In the\r\nIle-de-France, where from the nation's birth were lived its intensest\r\nhours, sprang up the churches which are the most national, the most\r\nracially French in character, Noyon, Senlis, Soissons, Laon, Paris.\r\n\r\nThe history of architecture proves that without a right-minded national\r\npride, ready to make sacrifices in order that it may transmit its high\r\ndeeds to the future, no mighty monuments rise. In 1214 Bouvines' victory\r\nwas won and French unity demonstrated. In 1220, not far away, was laid\r\nthe foundation stone of Amiens Cathedral, the crowning achievement of\r\nthe national art. A hazard, such juxtaposition? Ah, no. Nothing happens\r\nby chance in this science of the builder whose basic forces are long at\r\nwork in silence. Architecture is the truthteller of history.\r\n\r\nThe history of France, which in the XII and XIII centuries meant\r\nuniversal history, is written on the walls of the cathedrals built under\r\nPhilippe-Auguste and his grandson St. Louis, during the full flowering\r\nof the new national art. And in the days when France was neither happy\r\nnor good nor great, when faith flagged, when a minority's blind greed of\r\ngold ended the international fairs, drove out the Jews, overtaxed the\r\nclerical church builders, when the crusading enthusiasm ended in a\r\nTemplars' process, then the structural logic of Gothic architecture\r\nturned to pitiless geometry. So proclaim the cold, uninspired\r\nXIV-century churches, and few of them ever were built. It seemed almost\r\nas if the Gothic cycle had run its course. The XII century had seen its\r\nrise; the XIII century its apotheosis; the XIV century its decline. Was\r\nthe last word said? Churches are not built by generations that live in\r\nceaseless war, in misrule, or under a foreign yoke.\r\n\r\nThere was to be another chapter for the Gothic tale. Aspiration was born\r\nagain, national pride lifted its head and art flowered. Not from beyond\r\nthe mountains or the sea came the needed missionary this time, nor from\r\na Carolingian palace, nor out of Norman and Burgundian cloister. No\r\nsaint-king was to lead now, but only a young girl from a peasant hamlet.\r\n\r\nWhen Jeanne d'Arc broke the spell of foreign invasion, when she gave\r\nFrance a new soul, then all over the land rose that pæan of rejoicing\r\nwhich we call Flamboyant Gothic art, for verily it flamed up with joy.\r\nNever will you see an arch of double curvature, accoladed, soaring to\r\nits triumphal finial, never will you gaze at radiant belfries rising\r\nricher and richer with each story, never will you pray beneath a\r\nlate-Gothic pageantry picture window with its mullions swaying in\r\nexaltation, but the thought of the Maid of Orleans and her mission will\r\ncome to you. This Flamboyant art may run riot in details like any\r\nmodern, but it remains true in its essentials to the Middle Ages.\r\nForever will it tell of the freeing of France from foreign rule, even as\r\nthe academic Rayonnant phase sets forth the lowered ideals of Philippe\r\nle Bel, or the ampleness of XIII-century Gothic, the creative age of\r\nLouis IX and his augmenting grandfather. No regional schools were there\r\nin the last manifestations of the national art; they built the same at\r\nAlbi as at Rouen, at Bordeaux as at Lyons, for an entire people shared\r\nthe same feeling of recovered self-respect.\r\n\r\nYou can learn to read it by yourself, learn to _remember_, if only you\r\nare not repelled by that stiff word \"archæology.\" Just what generation\r\nmade Dijon's crypt and Morienval's ambulatory, put the masonry roofs on\r\nthe Caen abbatials, chiseled the column statues at the doors of Angers,\r\nLe Mans, and Chartres, made of Bourges' procession path a heavenly way\r\nof ruby, sapphire, emerald, and topaz, raised the tower at Senlis, paid\r\ntribute to St. Cecilia's gentleness in the white imagery of Albi's grim\r\nfortress--that is archæology. Archæology tells how Cluny lifted up a\r\nprostrate Christendom, how the Normans conquered England, how Abbot\r\nSuger reformed himself, how Bernard of Clairvaux exhorted Europe, how\r\nthe Lion-hearted went crusading as had his fascinating mother before\r\nhim, how Simon de Montfort won the Midi, how the wily Philippe-Auguste\r\nenlarged his domain, province by province--and all the while most of the\r\nGothic cathedrals of France laid their foundations--and how the\r\n_bon-saint-homme-roy_, truest lover of the builders' art, sat under an\r\noak tree, dispensing justice at first hand, with his loyal Joinville\r\nseated close beside him. That is archæology. It is written down clearly\r\non great stone pages of perennial beauty for us to read--_if only we\r\nwill_. A little knowledge of construction's laws is needed to show us\r\nhow to see. A little more of history to guide us when to feel. If to\r\nlove we must know, to know we must set ourselves to learn. Even in these\r\ndays of easy motor travel one cannot go about book-laden. But there are\r\nopen libraries in French cities where an inquirer is courteously lent\r\nthe monographs on the town's monuments, or the big folios that picture\r\nthe storied windows. It has, therefore, appeared advisable to give, with\r\neach cathedral, a list of its biographies, for they may be of use some\r\nrainy afternoon in France.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost unnecessary to remind ourselves that in the XII and XIII\r\ncenturies the Church of Europe--barring the Greek schism--was one and\r\nunited, save for the quarrels inseparable from all manifestations of\r\nmankind's history, and that the Protestant of to-day descends from the\r\nsame mediæval forefathers as does the Catholic, from the same builders\r\nof cathedrals, crusaders, feudal proprietors, and commune winners. To\r\nrefuse sympathy to the two best centuries of the Middle Ages because,\r\nthree hundred years later, occurred a break in western Christendom is as\r\nillogical as the attitude of those historians who would liken the\r\nreligious movement of the XVI century to the antisocial outcrop of\r\nOriental dualism called the Albigensian heresy.\r\n\r\nLet us then, with open minds, turn to this art of the builder, \"the\r\nstrongest, proudest, most orderly, most enduring of the arts of men that\r\nif once well done will stand more strongly than the unbalanced rocks,\r\nmore prevalently than the crumbling hills; the art which is associated\r\nwith all civic pride and sacred principle; with which men record their\r\npower, satisfy their enthusiasm, make sure their defense, define and\r\nmake dear their habitation.\"[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWhat Is Gothic Architecture?[3]\r\n\r\n                              _Le temps\r\n    Où tous nos monuments, et toutes nos croyances\r\n    Portaient le manteau blanc de leur virginité\r\n    Où sous la main de Christ, tout venait de renaître._\r\n    --ALFRED DE MUSSET.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1000 a new spirit animated the art of the builder in\r\nFrance. That rebirth, to which has been given the name Romanesque, held\r\nsway for a hundred and fifty years, and had reached its apogee when, in\r\nmid-XII century, it was superseded by the architecture we call Gothic.\r\nGothic architecture did not spring up like a mushroom. Like all\r\nmanifestations of art, it was the logical fulfillment of its\r\npredecessor. Romanesque and Gothic were phases of the same art. The\r\ndethronement of Romanesque was a voluntary abdication in favor of\r\nyounger, more efficient leadership: \"What is called the birth of Gothic\r\nis but the coming of age of Romanesque.\"\r\n\r\nThe XI-century monks who built monastic churches cleared the path for\r\nthe laymen builders of the Gothic cathedrals. With persistency, with\r\ncourage, the monk architects went forward, seeking a way. And the way\r\nsought, the problem on which they concentrated their energies, was how\r\nto protect their churches by masonry vaulting without sacrificing\r\namplitude or lighting.[4]\r\n\r\nOut of their trials to solve that problem there emerged a new principle\r\nof construction, and Gothic architecture was then born. Thrust and\r\ncounterthrust was the law of its being. Instead of the Romanesque idea\r\nof equilibrium by dead load, by sheer mass, which may be called a\r\ncontinuous counterbutting of the vault's thrust, there now was\r\nsubstituted equilibrium by intermittent abutment. By means of\r\ndiagonal-crossing ribs the vertical and lateral thrusts of the stone\r\nroof were collected at fixed points, which points alone had to be\r\ncounterbutted. Thick walls were a necessity in a Romanesque edifice, if\r\nit were to be stable, but in a Gothic building the walls could be made a\r\nmere shell, since all the work was done by an active skeleton, a bone\r\nstructure of stone, consisting of piers, arches, and buttresses.\r\n\r\nTo define shortly, Gothic architecture is the art of erecting buildings\r\nwith vaults whose ribs intersect (concentration of load) and whose\r\nthrusts are stopped by buttresses (the grounding of the thrusts). The\r\nnever-ceasing downward and outward thrust of the vaulting is met by an\r\nequivalent resistance in pier and buttress and solid earth. Equilibrium\r\nresults from that well-adjusted opposition of forces.\r\n\r\nSince the starting point in the development of Gothic was the vaulting,\r\nand how to substitute a stone vault for a wooden roof was the germinal\r\nidea of the Romanesque builder, it is no digression to turn to the\r\nearlier school, the chrysalis of Gothic. The name \"Romanesque\" is an\r\naffair of yesterday, employed by a French archæologist about 1825.\r\nVarious local designations had hitherto been used, such as Lombard, or\r\nNorman, or Romano-Byzantine, but the term Romanesque for this\r\narchitecture is as suitable as the name Romance is for the popular\r\nlanguages which, in that same period, were forming out of the corruption\r\nof Latin. A definition given by M. Camille Enlart is excellent:\r\n\"Romanesque art was a product of Rome, animated by a new spirit, and\r\ncombined with a certain number of elements of barbarian or Oriental\r\norigin.\"\r\n\r\nRome gave the basilica plan to western Europe, which for centuries\r\ncontinued to build its churches as oblong halls with a small apse at one\r\nend. The hall, or nave, consisted of a central vessel with side aisles\r\nthat were divided from it by piers. In the treatment of vaulting and the\r\nmethod of stone laying Romanesque architecture also derived from Rome.\r\nByzantine influences certainly were important, but they affected the\r\ndecoration more than the plan or the structure; the use of the Byzantine\r\ncupola was merely occasional. The Romanesque masters copied the ivories\r\nand miniatures of the Eastern Greeks till, in time, they turned to\r\nnature for their models, and then their work took on new life and\r\nevolved into the glory which is Gothic sculpture.\r\n\r\nWhile some have laid stress on the Oriental influences, rather than\r\nthose of Rome, in the formation of Romanesque art, others have\r\noveremphasized the personality and fantasy introduced into French\r\narchitecture by the Barbarian invasions. No doubt the influx of new\r\nblood added new elements, but since knowledge of the invaders' art is\r\nfragmentary, there can be no scientific base for the theory. Composite,\r\ncertainly, were the causes for the new spirit which animated\r\narchitecture after the Carolingian day, but it is safe to say that the\r\ninfluence of Rome predominated.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the centuries the Roman basilica was modified by the\r\nCatholic liturgy. For catechumens, or penitents, was made the porch, or\r\nnarthex, before the western end. Tribunes were built over the side\r\naisles.[5] Increased church ceremonial brought about a development of\r\nthe choir. The custom of burying the dead in crypts under the main\r\naltar originated the raised chancel. Between the choir and the nave the\r\nbuilders began to insert a transverse nave called a transept.[6] Such an\r\nenlargement enabled the congregation to approach closer to the altar\r\nceremonies; only the bigger churches built transepts in the XI century.\r\nThen the liturgical writers saw in a transept the extended arms of the\r\nCross, and it was in that spirit the XIII-century transepts were\r\nmade--their symbolism was posterior. The first ambulatories were no\r\ndoubt built in churches which possessed some revered relic, to\r\nfacilitate the passage of the pilgrim crowd. (The term ambulatory will\r\nbe used to designate the continuation of the choir aisle round the\r\napse.) Before long that curving processional path, with radiating\r\napsidal chapels opening from it, was taken to represent the crown of\r\nthorns about the Sacred Head. \"All things as pertain to offices and\r\nmatters ecclesiastical be full of divine signification and mysteries,\r\nand overflow with a celestial sweetness: if so be that a man be diligent\r\nin his study of them, and know how to draw honey from the rock and oil\r\nfrom the hardest stone.\" So wrote William Durandus, the XIII-century\r\nFrench bishop whose _Rationale_, or treatise on church symbolism, was an\r\ninspiration for centuries and, next to the Bible, the most frequently\r\nprinted book of the older times.[7]\r\n\r\nDespite a host of additions to the basilica of Rome--transept,\r\nambulatory, a long choir, apse chapels, towers--despite the discarding\r\nof the classic orders and of antiquity's use of a veneer of finer stone\r\n(the Romanesque builder used the unadorned stone of his own region) the\r\nchurch of western Europe remained, in general plan, a Roman basilica.\r\nLike Rome, they covered their main vessel by a flat wooden roof,\r\nalthough they knew how to build barrel and groin vaulting.[8]\r\n\r\nNow a wooden roof is an easy prey for fire. Such roofs, a succession of\r\nlong-continued invasions, and the faulty construction of Merovingian and\r\nCarolingian churches are accountable for the fact that in France to-day\r\nis no church that predates the year 1000. Some portions of ancient wall\r\nare embedded in later work, and some few early crypts are intact. But to\r\nspeak with certainty of Merovingian and Carolingian architecture is\r\nimpossible, though they formed the incubating phase of Romanesque art.\r\n\r\nIn France the IX and X centuries were periods of overwhelming disaster.\r\nIn the Midi were Saracen incursions. In northern and central France\r\nNorman pirates wiped out Charlemagne's revival of art. As far as\r\nPoitiers and Clermont the Northmen's path of destruction extended. \"Look\r\nwhere you will,\" wrote Flodoard, the chronicler, \"the sky is red with\r\nfires.\" To the litany was added a new invocation--_A furore Normannorum,\r\nlibera nos, Domine_.\r\n\r\nThe falling to pieces of Charlemagne's civilization and the general\r\nreturn of social disorders have led to an overdramatic contrasting of\r\nthe year 1000, when mankind, in terror, anticipated the ending of the\r\nworld, with the rebirth of hope and of building energy, when the dread\r\nday had passed. Whenever the gaunt horses--famine, pest, war, and\r\ndeath--are afoot, humanity is prone to look for the fulfillment of the\r\napocalyptic prophecy. Previous to the X century the final day had been\r\nawaited, and the same superstition was to seize on the world's\r\nimagination in following centuries.\r\n\r\nThe X century was certainly a desperate age. Fifty years of it were\r\nfamine, and on the highroads people were killed for food. But the evils\r\ndid not cease precisely with the year 1000; also it should be noted that\r\na certain number of churches were begun before the XI century opened.\r\nHowever, to mark the start of a new art life the year 1000 is a\r\nconvenient date if we bear in mind that it was not a sharp division\r\nbetween Carolingian and Romanesque architecture, since a gradual\r\nevolution took place. All through the XI century the vital renewal of\r\narchitecture went on, and churches were built which, to this day, are\r\nunrivaled for their profound religious spirit. They exist to tell us\r\nthat in the harsh life whence they emerged there were enlightened cases.\r\nThey vindicate, by their grand simplicity and detachment of soul, the\r\nmen who built them. Never was an art less one of routine than this of\r\nthe so-called hidebound monks, an art of a people reborn, full of\r\nyouth's daring, an art that was never to have an old age, eager,\r\nuntiring, experimental, an art that fitly generated the most\r\nscientifically sound of architectures--Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe heterogeneous races, Celtic and Gallo-Roman, Germanic, and Norse,\r\nwhose conflicts long had held France in anarchy, were at last welding\r\ninto one people. The advent of a vigorous third dynasty, under whose\r\nleadership social conditions improved, was another cause of art's\r\nrebirth. Not long after 1000 the bishops formulated the _Trève de Dieu_,\r\nby which peace was enforced on the turbulent lords from Wednesday night\r\nto Monday morning. With interval of peace came commerce and wealth and\r\nthe security necessary for works of the imagination. The rebuilding of\r\nchurches was inevitable.\r\n\r\nInvasions and wholesale conflagrations had impressed on the mediæval\r\nmind the necessity of a church roof more durable than wood, but a\r\nmasonry vault over a wide space was a constructive feat too difficult to\r\nbe achieved immediately. In fact, up to the very end of the XI century,\r\nthough the builders had succeeded in vaulting with stone the crypt, the\r\napse, and the side aisles, they continued generally to cover the wide\r\ncentral vessel in wood. However, the fecund idea was at work. From the\r\ntime that it took possession of their imagination, to the day when\r\nGothic, its fulfillment, was clearly enunciated, there was over a\r\ncentury of continuous effort--roughly speaking, from the year 1000 to\r\nthe memorable day in 1144 when was dedicated the first truly Gothic\r\nmonument of considerable size--the abbey church of St. Denis. Within\r\nthat energetic span of years is embraced the Romanesque architecture of\r\nFrance.[9]\r\n\r\nThe monk, Raoul Glaber, wrote an account of the rebirth of architecture\r\nafter the year 1000. It has been quoted to weariness, but is none the\r\nless a valuable contemporary record. The whole earth, he says, as of one\r\naccord seemed to throw off its tatters of old age and to reclothe itself\r\nin a white mantle of churches. The monastery in which lived monk Raoul,\r\nSt. Bénigne, at Dijon, was one of the first to inaugurate the new\r\ncentury, and its present crypt dates from the year 1001. Soon after 1017\r\nthe monks of Mont-Saint-Michel, in the far corner of Normandy, began a\r\nnew church, to which belonged part of the present nave. At Chartres,\r\nBishop Fulbert undertook to rebuild his cathedral after the fire of\r\n1020, and the vast crypt which to-day astonishes every beholder was his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler, Raoul Glaber, lived under the rule of the most powerful\r\nmonastic brotherhood ever organized, Benedictine Cluny, embracing\r\nseveral thousand houses scattered over Europe. Founded in 910, during\r\nthe darkest years of the Middle Ages, Cluny kept alive the light of\r\nlearning and art, \"the solitary torchbearer that passed on the flame\r\nfrom the spent glow of Charlemagne to the Gothic rekindling.\" Her monks\r\nwere the pioneers of civilization. Cluny beat back barbarism with a\r\npertinacity that should make hers an honored name in history. So\r\nestablished was her reputation as a civilizer that William the Conqueror\r\nwrote to the great Abbot Hugues, to beg from him Cluny monks for\r\nEngland, saying that he would pay their weight in bullion.\r\n\r\nCluny formed the savants who made the XII century memorable. Her fertile\r\nseed provided Europe with doctors, ambassadors, bishops, and popes.\r\nGregory VII had passed through her discipline, and in his giant task of\r\nreform, it was from Abbot Hugues that he solicited monks of Cluny. Urban\r\nII, who set in motion the First Crusade, had been a monk in the great\r\nBurgundian house. It is interesting to note that a generation of\r\nreforming pontiffs accompanied the expansion of the Romanesque movement.\r\nThis would seem to contradict the notion, which many hold, that the\r\nclergy profits by keeping the people in superstitious ignorance. It is\r\nwhen religion is purified of its dross that man's respiritualized faith\r\nout-flows in generous donations to the Church.\r\n\r\nSt. Benedict had taught his sons that work as well as prayer was a part\r\nof salvation. The monks of Cluny fostered agriculture, thus taking away\r\nits stigma as serf's work. Thierry speaks of the mediæval monastery as a\r\nmodel farm. In Cluny craftsmen of every kind were trained; its school of\r\nmusic was noted, and along the roads, as they traveled, the monks from\r\nBurgundy sang canticles. But the art of arts for Cluny was that of the\r\nbuilder, the supreme art that takes into its service all the others, to\r\nlead them to the glorification of God's house. When, in bands of twelve,\r\nthe monks of Cluny set out to colonize in Spain, in Germany, in Italy,\r\nin Poland, everywhere they carried with them the tool as well as the\r\nBook. As a rule they conformed in each province to the local building\r\ntraditions. There was never a distinct Cluny school of Romanesque\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the XI century the main provincial centers of France had\r\neach evolved its own special building characteristics. French Romanesque\r\narchitecture has been divided into some six or seven regional\r\nschools--those of Normandy, Burgundy, Auvergne, Poitou, Languedoc,\r\nProvence, and a minor school, the Franco-Picard.[10]\r\n\r\nIn their efforts to protect their churches by masonry roofs, these\r\nvarious regional schools made use of the barrel vault or the groin\r\nvault. The latter was found too insecure to span a wide space. Now, the\r\nthrust of a barrel vault was exerted along the whole length of the wall,\r\nwhich necessitated a continuous abutment--in other words, an enormously\r\nthick wall. Only small windows could be opened. Since the Romanesque\r\narchitect had the ambition to light his church well, and not to encumber\r\nhis floor surface by clumsy piers, a barrel vaulting could be but a\r\ntemporary solution of the main problem.\r\n\r\nThe struggle for a satisfactory stone roof was pursued tenaciously. Many\r\na clearstory wall was thrust apart by the vaulting's pressure. Thus the\r\nabbey church of Bec, finished in the 'forties of the XI century, was\r\nreconstructed in the 'fifties, and three times, again, had to be\r\nrebuilt. No failure could daunt the courage of those old monastic\r\nbuilders. Already inherent in the newly amalgamated race was the\r\ncreative genius of France. Perseverance and courage were to have their\r\nreward.\r\n\r\nThe theory long taught in the École des Chartes was that in the first\r\npart of the XI century, among a number of rural churches in the royal\r\ndomain, there gradually came into use the member which was to\r\nrevolutionize the science of building. The idea did not spring from one\r\nbrain; it was a collective, not an individual, triumph. When, under some\r\ngroin vault, no doubt at first to reinforce it, some obscure mason\r\nconstructed the earliest intersecting stone ribs, the first step in\r\nGothic architecture had been taken.[11]\r\n\r\nFrom that essential organ, the other characteristics of Gothic art were\r\ndeduced: flying buttress, slender piers, expanse of windows. In a Gothic\r\nvault the infilling, or web, rested elastically on the diagonal ribs. As\r\nthe load of the stone roof was thus concentrated at fixed junctures, it\r\nwas necessary to reinforce only those given points. Buttresses became\r\nintermittent. All the disintegrating force of the heavy vaulting was\r\ngathered on the diagonally crossing arches. An arch never sleeps, said\r\nthe old Arab proverb. Let us then, said the mediæval architect, set a\r\nguard on it that also never sleeps; and from that idea he proceeded to\r\ndevelop the greatest architecture of all times. The force of expansion\r\nwas counteracted by a proportionate force of compression. By means of a\r\nframework made up of vault ribs, of piers, of buttresses, and flying\r\nbuttresses, the edifice became a living skeleton. The walls between the\r\nactive members, when relieved of their load, served merely as screen\r\ninclosures and could be carved into fragile beauty and hung with\r\ntransparent tapestries of colored glass. Because the flying buttress\r\ntransmitted a large part of the vault's pressure to the exterior\r\nbuttress piles, the piers within the church could be lessened in\r\ndiameter, and greater capacity be given to the interior.\r\n\r\nEach new trial was a lesson learned. It was only with time that they\r\nadjusted precisely the sufficient counterpoise to the thrust of the\r\nvaults; it was only by degrees that the pier's diameter was lessened,\r\nonly with practice that was learned the placing of flying buttresses\r\nneither too high nor too low. At first many a flying buttress was made\r\nneedlessly heavy. The solid wall in between the buttresses was not\r\ndiscarded all at once. In the first Gothic churches windows continued to\r\nbe single lights, then two or three lancets were placed side by side,\r\nsubsequently each light was subdivided by mullions, and gradually an\r\nelaborate fenestration developed. For a time, too, the round arch\r\ncontinued in use, and the earliest vault ribs were semicircular. With\r\nthe fusion of the equilateral arch and the counterbutted intersecting\r\nribs, the essence of Gothic architecture was achieved.\r\n\r\nLesser consequences of the new form of vaulting followed in logical\r\nsuccession. Obeying the law that it is the thing borne which commands\r\nthe form of the thing that bears, the ribs may be said to have drawn out\r\nof the sturdy pier of Romanesque art the clustered columns of Gothic\r\ngracefulness.\r\n\r\nNot a single beauty in a Gothic church but has a structural\r\nexplanation. The soaring pinnacles that crown the buttresses are\r\napparently mere ornaments, but in reality those gallant little bits of\r\ndecoration are of sound engineering usefulness. By weighting the\r\nbuttresses, they hasten to channel the transmitted lateral thrust of the\r\nvaulting into a vertical pressure, and they increase, too, the\r\ncounterthrust of the flying buttress against the side walls.\r\n\r\nA clear comprehension of Gothic is impossible unless the fact be grasped\r\nthat architecture is nothing if not structural, and that no decoration\r\ncan veil a faulty skeleton. Ornamentation is the spontaneous blossoming\r\nof the structure, else it is meaningless--a principle many a modern\r\narchitect might well digest. Too long has the most scientifically exact\r\nof architectures been judged by its embellishments, which often enough,\r\nin the hands of the copyist, do become a florid veneer without reason.\r\n\r\nThe Gothic master-of-works was right when he said that nothing which was\r\ninherently needed could be ugly. No longer were flying buttresses hidden\r\nunder the cover of wooden roofs. Proudly ranged about the church, those\r\nessential practical members became one of the distinctive beauties of\r\nthe new science of building. Renan, with his treacherous half praise,\r\nhas called the flying buttress a crutch needed by an architecture which,\r\nfrom its start, nourished the seeds of decay, since it was based on no\r\nsound constructive formula. Its success was a prestidigitator's trick,\r\nhe said. Such criticism misunderstands the A B C of Gothic lore. Can a\r\nliving limb be called a crutch? it has been aptly asked. The Gothic\r\ncathedral is not only the most complicated, but is also the most\r\ncomplete, organism ever conceived by man.\r\n\r\nWhere the first diagonal-crossing ribs are to be found will probably\r\nnever be known. Various have been the claimants. The Rhenish claim is no\r\nlonger taken seriously. Gothic made its first appearance in Germany as a\r\nfully developed French art, and its XIII-century name, there, was _opus\r\nfrancigenum_. In his Gothic work the Teuton showed a fondness for the\r\n_tour-de-force_ and his manual dexterity surprises more than it\r\nsatisfies. The best German works in architecture are the sober\r\nRomanesque churches. Germany's school was developed a century before the\r\nRomanesque of France; across the Rhine occurred no Norman invasion to\r\nsever art traditions from Charlemagne's renaissance. The pre-Gothic art\r\nsuited her ethnical temperament, and was long adhered to. While France\r\nwas building Gothic, Germany was still erecting Romanesque cathedrals.\r\nNot till the end of the XII century were churches along that \"_rue des\r\nmoines_,\" the Rhine, vaulted in the new manner.\r\n\r\nThe claim of Italy to be the first to use the diagonal ribs is denied by\r\nmost French archæologists, but is put forward by the Italian scholar\r\nRivoira and by Mr. Arthur Kingsley Porter.[12] The latter cites the\r\nchurch of Sannazzaro Sesia as showing proofs that its high nave was\r\nGothic vaulted by 1040. For a century, he says, the Lombard churches\r\nused diagonals, especially in Milan, where wood was scarce and it was\r\neasier to build permanent brick ribs under the groin vault than to mold\r\nthe groin on a temporary substructure. Diagonal ribs were invented, he\r\nthinks, as a device to economize wood. That may be true of the Lombard\r\nchurches, of which he has made an elaborate study. And it may be true\r\nthat the use of such diagonals filtered into Provence and Languedoc,\r\nwhere appeared some early Gothic vaults sporadically before 1150, at\r\nFréjus, Marseilles, Maguelonne, and Moissac, all with the rectangular\r\nprofile of the Lombard type. The theory he advocates does not prove why\r\nthe Ile-de-France masons could not themselves, without hint from\r\nLombardy, have stumbled on the new feature which was to revolutionize\r\nthe builder's art. Why should we prefer his explanation for the first\r\nuse of diagonals--the desire to economize wood--to that advanced by the\r\nFrench scholars--the effort to brace a falling groin vault?\r\n\r\nMr. Porter acknowledges that not a single Lombard church was rib-vaulted\r\nthroughout, that the Lombard architects never counterbutted their\r\ndiagonals properly, that their vaults proved unsatisfactory, so that\r\nafter 1120 they returned to their groin and barrel vaulting, or used\r\ntimber roofs, in those regions where wood abounded. The destruction of\r\nMilan through the German invasion, in 1162, was a fatal blow to Lombard\r\narchitecture. We can only conjecture how northern Italy might have\r\nworked out the problem of stone roofs. The best definition of Gothic,\r\nthinks Mr. Porter, is Professor Moore's, which concludes thus: \"Wherever\r\nis wanting a framework maintained on the principle of thrust and\r\ncounterthrust, there we have not Gothic.\" The Lombard churches never met\r\nthe vault thrust with counterthrust of buttress. Surely not in Lombardy\r\nwas conceived the new system of construction?\r\n\r\nS. Ambrogio at Milan was cited as l'oeuvre initiale, till it was\r\nproved that it was built not in the IX century, but after 1067; and as\r\nlater disasters necessitated reconstructions, none of the present\r\ndiagonals was extant before 1198. S. Abondio at Como, consecrated by\r\nUrban II, in 1095, has some very early intersecting ribs, but they are\r\nmore a step toward the new system than a true Gothic vault, since the\r\nribs merely reinforce and do not carry the cells.\r\n\r\nM. Camille Enlart contends that the systematic use of Gothic in Italy\r\nwas not earlier than the second quarter of the XIII century, and was\r\nbrought across the Alps by French Cistercian monks. Though for centuries\r\nItaly used it, she apprehended its constructive principle imperfectly.\r\nBecause she possessed a Niccola Pisano, a Giotto, a family of Cosmati to\r\nveil the poverty of her Gothic skeleton with details of consummate\r\nbeauty, criticism is silenced. Her best Gothic monument, the cathedral\r\nof Siena, was insecure because of technical errors. Always was Italy\r\nadverse to showing the mechanism by which an edifice stood; few flying\r\nbuttresses were ever built south of the Alps. She preferred the classic\r\nwide spacing of piers, an unencumbered interior, and small windows\r\nagainst her hot sun. Who remembers that he is in a Gothic church when in\r\nthe somber cathedral of Florence? Its long nave is divided into four\r\nbays where a northern church would have used eight. For Italy the\r\nRenaissance was a whole-hearted return to a national art which she could\r\nfully understand.\r\n\r\nNo people outside of France better understood and developed Gothic art\r\nthan the English. Their claim to priority is based on the date of the\r\ncathedral of Durham, whose choir-aisle diagonals Mr. John Bilson says\r\nare as early as 1093. Since those diagonals show no hesitation, they\r\nmust have been preceded by others. Where in England are there to be\r\nfound the earlier trials? The English claim is practically a Norman one,\r\nand Normandy's experimental work in Gothic vaultings remains to be\r\ntraced. Rivoira claims that Lombard influences predominated in the\r\nformation of Normandy's Romanesque school. Can the Norman be said to\r\nhave discerned in diagonals their immense possibilities any clearer than\r\nhad the Lombard?\r\n\r\nThose among the French archæologists who have disputed the Norman claim\r\nto priority say that the principal span of Norman and English churches\r\nwas covered with timber roofs far into the XII century. We know that the\r\nGothic vaulting of the two abbey churches of Caen were XII-century\r\nadditions, and M. de Lasteyrie thought the same was true of Durham,\r\nthough Mr. Bilson has convinced MM. Enlart and Lefèvre-Pontalis that\r\nDurham's choir-aisle vaults are an original part of the cathedral begun\r\nin 1093. Not till 1174, when Guillaume de Sens began Canterbury\r\nCathedral, did French Gothic architecture, in its plenitude, appear in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThe question of priority remains an open one. It might almost be said\r\nthat vaulting with intersecting ribs began to appear here and there\r\nsimultaneously, that if it had not cropped out in the Ile-de-France, it\r\nwould have appeared in Normandy, or vice versa. And not long after them,\r\nthe builders in Burgundy and Anjou began to use it. Before 1150,\r\nisolated samples of the Gothic rib vault appeared at Vézelay, Poitiers,\r\nBordeaux, Quimperlé, Moissac, St. Gilles, Marseilles. The hour was ripe\r\nfor the solution. Gothic architecture was the spontaneous invention of\r\nFrench builders at the dawn of the XII century, at a time when the\r\npoetry of France was imposing itself on the whole of Europe.\r\n\r\n_L'oeuvre initiale_ will never be known. However, there was a region\r\nwhere the early use of the ogival vault was not accidental, but\r\nsystematic, one spot in the heart of France where it immediately made a\r\nschool, since there it found no strong earlier traditions to overcome,\r\nwhere it became a living organism and went through a succession of\r\nlogical developments until it had taken on the main characteristics of\r\nthe new art. There is one center from which Gothic architecture spread\r\nout with slow, sure march into the neighboring regions. In the\r\nIle-de-France, all the trials were summed up and developed by Abbot\r\nSuger at St. Denis. From 1140 to 1144 he wedded definitely the pointed\r\narch with the diagonal rib.\r\n\r\nThe French masters, who have contended that the Ile-de-France is the\r\ncradle of Gothic architecture, have had lesser controversies among\r\nthemselves as to which special portion of the royal domain led in the\r\nevolution. M. Woillez, a pioneer, considered the environs of Beauvais\r\nthe favored spot; M. Saint-Paul looked to the districts between Normandy\r\nand Paris; M. Enlart sought the nucleus in Amiens diocese in Picardy;\r\nand M. Lefèvre-Pontalis chose the classic diocese of Soissons. The two\r\nlatter masters have modified their views since studying Durham's vaults,\r\nand they may modify them further in regard to Lombardy's early use of\r\ndiagonals. The controversy is not closed.\r\n\r\nThe France of that day was more a feudal confederation than a united\r\nkingdom, and some of the king's vassals ruled territories larger than\r\nhis own. If the feeling of nationality is created as much by great\r\nachievements in common, as by political boundaries and the ties of\r\nblood, if, as all now agree, the enthusiasm of the Crusades, those holy\r\nwars against a common foe, helped to weld the rival sections of France\r\ninto one nation, surely that other enthusiasm of the day, those other\r\n_Gesta Dei_ per Francos, the building of the Gothic cathedrals, played\r\nan important part in forming the national soul. From end to end of\r\nFrance they were building when at the battle of Bouvines a French king\r\nunited with the jealous barons, with clergy and with burgess and with\r\nvillein in a common defense of their native land. King, clergy, lords,\r\nand people fought at Bouvines, and king, clergy, lords, and people built\r\nthe big national churches. All the energies of the times went to their\r\nmaking, all the primitive strong purposes, all the newly stirred\r\nintellect of the schools. Science was as needed for them as inspiration,\r\nfor without the long manual training of the guilds, the mystic glow had\r\nnot sufficed.\r\n\r\nThere has crept into various architectural manuals, since first M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc voiced it, a theory which scarcely needs refuting, so\r\ndisproved is it by modern research.[13] Gothic art is considered as the\r\nlayman's expression of revolt against the Romanesque art of the monks,\r\nan idea that denies the structural sequence of the two phases of the\r\nsame art, and would present Gothic as a reaction against its\r\npredecessor, instead of its supreme development.\r\n\r\nWe read that a cathedral was built as a sort of assembly hall for the\r\nrising communes, and not _pour loger le bon Dieu_. Now in every known\r\ncase it was the bishop who started the rebuilding of each cathedral, and\r\nthe works usually began with the choir, the part of a church suitable\r\nonly for the cult. Even when a bishop, in his character of proprietor of\r\na city (as in the case of Rheims and Laon), opposed the communal claims,\r\nhe and the people went on building their cathedral together. We have\r\nprecious documents to assure us in what spirit of piety the work was\r\ndone. All classes and all ages, women as well as men, gave their\r\nvoluntary labor to the new works, after having confessed and\r\ncommunicated in pious confraternities; sometimes it was for an abbot\r\nthat they dragged in the stones from the quarry, as at St. Denis and St.\r\nPierre-sur-Dives; sometimes it was to aid a bishop, as at Chartres and\r\nRouen. To offset such irrefutable evidence there is not one contemporary\r\nreference to a laic, or communal purpose.\r\n\r\nAlso, when it is asserted that the bishop helped the cathedrals because\r\nthey were jealous of the monastic orders, there is not one historical\r\nrecord to confront a host of documents which disprove the idea. Large\r\nnumbers of the bishop-builders issued from monasteries, founded\r\nmonasteries, and returned to monasteries to die. While Maurice de Sully\r\nwas erecting Notre Dame, at Paris, he built four monasteries, in one of\r\nwhich he requested to be buried. The bishop who began Auxerre Cathedral\r\nchose Cistercian Pontigny for his tomb. The bishop-builders of Noyon,\r\nLaon, Senlis, Soissons, Rheims, Bourges, and Rouen were buried among the\r\nmonks. That there should occasionally be friction between a bishop and\r\nan abbot over legal privileges is only characteristic of human nature in\r\nall times. As a class the bishops were not opposed to the monks, nor the\r\nOrders to the secular clergy. The monks of St. Remi honored the\r\narchbishop of Rheims in their choir windows.\r\n\r\nThe cloister welcomed the new architecture. Transition Gothic churches\r\nwere built by the monks of St. Germain-des-Prés and St.\r\nMartin-des-Champs at Paris, and one could prolong the list into pages.\r\nWhere in Burgundy is found the earliest Gothic? In the Cistercian church\r\nof Pontigny, and in Benedictine Vézelay. Where in Champagne?--the\r\nabbatials of Notre Dame at Châlons-sur-Marne and St. Remi at Rheims. In\r\nNormandy? In the Midi?--again the answer is, in abbey churches. Indeed,\r\nmonastic building energy seemed inexhaustible, for where the prime of\r\nGothic arrived, it was still the monks who produced that masterpiece of\r\nthe new art, the Merveille of Mont-Saint-Michel.\r\n\r\nIn the XII century the spread of monastic life took on a phenomenal\r\naspect. Benedictine houses and those of the newly founded Orders of\r\nCîteaux and Prémontré increased, not by hundreds, but by thousands. The\r\nmonks were in absolute accord with the spirit of their time. Sons of the\r\ncloister had inspired the entire XI century: Gregory VII, Abbot William\r\nof Dijon, St. Anselm, Lanfranc, St. Hugues of Cluny. A bevy of\r\nremarkable men of the cloister led the XII century, the chief being\r\nSuger of St. Denis, protector of the serfs, the man of genius who\r\nstimulated the bishops of France to remake their cathedrals in emulation\r\nof his Gothic abbey church, and St. Bernard of Clairvaux, on whose words\r\nall Europe hung.\r\n\r\nArchitecture passed to laic control when the protection of monastic life\r\nwas no longer needed for artists, and when the science of building\r\nrequired the specialist, the man occupied with it alone. The schools of\r\nCluny had trained the first guildsmen, and many of the names of Gothic\r\narchitects--Orbais, Honnecourt, Corbic--indicate that they were born in\r\nplaces where monastic building industries flourished. It was in the\r\nnatural course of events that the art should pass out of the possession\r\nof the few into the general national life.\r\n\r\nAnother natural happening has been distorted by partisans. The burning\r\nof monastery archives during the XVI-century religious wars and by the\r\nRevolution is accountable for the few names of architects that have come\r\ndown to us. The scarcity of such names has been cited as an instance of\r\nthe jealous suppression of the laymen by the clergy forced to employ\r\nthem. Now precisely the contrary is the truth. What modern architect was\r\never accorded such prominence as was allowed by the bishops of Amiens\r\nand Rheims to their masters-of-works when they inscribe those laymen\r\nnames in the labyrinth designs of the cathedral pavements? The monks of\r\nMarmoutier and of St. Germain-des-Prés were proud to bury in their\r\nabbey-churches their architects Étienne de Mortagne and Pierre de\r\nMontereau. In Rheims, the architects Hugues Libergier and Robert de\r\nCoucy were likewise honored.\r\n\r\nBy digging in old archives, the modern student is ever adding new names\r\nto the nation's honor roll. Many a gap still remains, but the very\r\nanonymousness of such masters of the living stone is stuff for the\r\nimagination. One likes to picture the old-time craftsman-artist\r\nrejoicing in his insignificance as he chiseled his leaf and vine just as\r\nhe saw them by the roadside. He served a Master who gave like wages to\r\nall who worked in spirit and in truth, to him who, in the hidden corners\r\nwhere no human eye could penetrate, carved his leaf and flower with the\r\nsame love as did the greater artist working on the stately imaged\r\nportals.\r\n\r\nThe \"heretical Gothic-sculpture bogey\" has led certain imaginations\r\nastray. There are those who find latent heresy in the old carvers' work;\r\nthey point, with suggestive smile, to the bishop and monk placed among\r\nthe damned in the Last Judgments at the cathedral doors. Let them turn\r\nto the sermons of the day and they will find precisely the same\r\nChristian doctrine of the equality of all men before sin and punishment,\r\npreached from the pulpit within the church. Not in all the myriad scenes\r\nfrom Old and New Testaments is a single doctrinal error to be found,\r\nsays M. Émile Mâle, who is master of the iconography of French churches.\r\nThe sculptor layman merely carried out the scheme of the trained\r\ntheologian.\r\n\r\nMany a sharp word does M. Viollet-le-Duc give as critic to those who\r\nenjoy in a cathedral the superficial beauties of decoration, but are\r\nblind to the efficient structure, to the scientific upholding skeleton.\r\nSurely it is a still more radical ignorance which perceives in a Gothic\r\nchurch its mechanical perfection, but denies the aspiration to\r\nimmortality which was its inceptive spirit. To ascribe the origin of\r\ncathedrals to the need by the nascent commune of a town hall is to make\r\nof those soaring monuments veritable follies of human pride. Restore to\r\nthem their religious soul, have eyes to see what may be called their\r\nspiritual framework, and as up-leaps toward the infinite they are\r\nsublimities. Can churches be the creation of rebellion and hate when\r\ninto their very stones passed the clamorous vibrant faith of those\r\ncrusading generations? Like hovering prayers their vaults seem to shut\r\none in. The heart, weary of modern sophistry, draws strength from their\r\neternal affirmation. He must have little music in his soul who is deaf\r\nto such a _Credo_. When men built Gothic cathedrals they knelt on both\r\nknees to pray, and never have they soared more supremely above\r\nthemselves. \"Deeds of God through the French\" are these temples.\r\n\r\nA word in regard to the term \"Gothic.\" It is as unreasonable a misnomer\r\nas could have been chosen, but since usage has sanctioned it, it must\r\npass. Primarily put into currency by the Italians of the Renaissance, in\r\nthe injurious sense of barbarous, the term was adopted by the French\r\nneo-classics of the XVII century. Molière's scathing line on Gothic\r\nsculpture is well known--\"_Ces monstres odieux des siècles ignorants_.\"\r\nHe complained that Gothic art \"_fit à la politesse une mortelle\r\nguerre_.\" When Racine spoke of Chartres Cathedral he made use of the\r\nterm _barbare_; even to the churchman Fénelon the cathedrals of the\r\nMiddle Ages appeared unreasoned and faulty.\r\n\r\nThe opprobrious term was fixed by the Encyclopædists of the next\r\ncentury, when prejudice against the Middle Ages became militant and\r\norganized. With exclusive pedantism they dismissed the most national and\r\ncivilized of arts as worthy of those rough invaders, the Goths.\r\nVoltaire, who, says Guizot, garnered only what was mean and criminal in\r\nthe Middle Ages, saw in the study of Gothic architecture \"a coarse\r\ncuriosity, lacking good taste.\" As late as 1800, a project was abroad to\r\ndisencumber the soil of France of \"these overcharged façades with their\r\nmultitude of indecent and ridiculous figures.\" And still later, the\r\nstudents in the national school of architecture were taught to despise\r\nthe most reasoned, the most robust, the most logical of arts as a style\r\nof confusion and caprice.\r\n\r\nThe rehabilitation of Gothic architecture in France, if tardy, has been\r\nample. No branch of modern science presents a more able corps of\r\nworkers. While true to the Latin genius, which unites clarity of style\r\nwith an exact erudition, they have obeyed a yet deeper race instinct\r\nwhich knows that matter must be vivified by spirit, else learning sinks\r\nto a dry-as-dust recording, incapable of its highest flight. The telling\r\nof the monumental story of France has been touched by the sacred flame\r\nof patriotism. Like paladins, these modern knights are abroad on all the\r\nby-paths eager to rescue some hidden treasure of the national art.\r\nFuture scholarship will look back at the brilliant achievements of the\r\nFrench archæologists of to-day with the same pride that is felt for the\r\nBenedictine savants of the XVII century.\r\n\r\nThe aim of archæology is to date a monument correctly. How to do this by\r\nscientific method has been taught the last two generations at the École\r\ndes Chartes, the national school par excellence, so M. de Vögué called\r\nit. Archives are pored over to trace each link with history, and those\r\nmonuments which have no authenticated pedigree are compared with those\r\nof certain date. Each manuscript date is verified by the analysis of the\r\nedifice itself, whose successive campaigns of building are deciphered,\r\nsince few and far between are the homogeneous churches. Each restoration\r\nalso is verified. One of the solid bases for archæological exactness is\r\nthe knowledge of profiles, which are called by the English textbook rib\r\nmolds, arch molds, pier molds, or base molds. By a comparative analysis\r\nof profiles, a monument can now be accurately dated. As keystones were\r\nof different types in the various earlier decades of Gothic, they too\r\nhelp to substantiate an edifice.[14]\r\n\r\nChurches of one region are contrasted with those of another. The\r\nmaterial employed is considered, since the stone of a province causes\r\nrichness or poverty of sculpture: thus, Brittany's granite and\r\nAuvergne's lava mean an undeveloped sculpture compared with the fine\r\nwhite limestone districts of the Oise, or in Normandy and Poitou. When\r\npracticable, excavations under an edifice can give data concerning\r\nprevious churches on the site.\r\n\r\nM. Jules Quicherat was the first to teach that the history of the Middle\r\nAges architecture was the history of the architect's fight against the\r\nweight and push of the vaulting.[15] Once the right path was blazed,\r\nmany an able pioneer helped clear the new road--such students as\r\nViollet-le-Duc, de Caumont, Woillez, Prosper Merimée, de Dion, Coutan,\r\nde Beaurepaire, Grandmaison, Révoil, Rupricht-Robert, Félix de Verneilh,\r\nAnthyme Saint-Paul, Louis Courajod, Buhot de Kersers. At the École des\r\nChartes, Robert de Lasteyrie occupied with distinction the chair held by\r\nQuicherat for thirty years, and his pupils, Camille Enlart and Eugène\r\nLefèvre-Pontalis, in their turn, are passing on the high tradition to a\r\nyounger school. M. Enlart, the director of the museum of comparative\r\nsculpture at the Trocadéro, is an authority on Romanesque architecture,\r\nand has initiated the study of the spread of Gothic architecture in\r\nmediæval Italy, Spain, the North, and the Levant.[16] M.\r\nLefèvre-Pontalis has written a host of erudite monographs; one learns to\r\naccept his decisions as final, in so far as the ever-expanding realm of\r\nknowledge can be final. He directs the invaluable publications called\r\nthe _Congrès Archéologique de France_ and the _Bulletin Monumental_, and\r\nhe edits those excellent short studies known as the _Petites\r\nMonographies des grands édifices de la France_, which are convenient\r\npocket guides for the serious tourist.[17]\r\n\r\nEach year is producing final monographs on the chief churches of France.\r\nM. Georges Durand has rendered fitting tribute to Amiens. M. de Farcy\r\nhas identified himself with Angers, René Merlet with Chartres, Lucien\r\nBroche with Laon, and Lucien Bégule with Lyons. MM. Brutails has\r\nspecialized on Gascony, the Thollier and H. du Ranquet on Auvergne,\r\nLabande on Provence, Berthelé on Plantagenet Gothic, André Rhein on\r\nPoitou and Anjou, Émile Bonnet on Hérault, Charles Porée on Burgundy,\r\nand Louis Demaison on Champagne. Other able students are MM. Bouet,\r\nLouis Serbat, Marcel Aubert, Ernest Rupin, Jules de Lahondès, René Fage,\r\nAmédée Boinet, Jean Virey, Robert Triger, and Louis Régnier.\r\n\r\nPrecious texts have been unearthed from the archives by Victor Mortet,\r\nHenri Stein, and Eugène Müntz. The sculpture of France has been studied\r\nby MM. Robert de Lasteyrie, Émile Lambin, Léon Palustre, Eugène Müntz,\r\nGabriel Fleury, Raymond Koechlin, J. M. de Vasselot, Paul Vitry, Gaston\r\nBrière, André Michel, Louis Gonse, and Émile Mâle. The latter three have\r\nbrought out monumental general works. _L'art gothique_ of Gonse gives\r\nthe most exact and extended account of the beginning of Gothic, says\r\nAnthyme Saint-Paul, who is himself one of the most inspiring masters of\r\nmediæval archæology. M. Michel, who is conservator of the national\r\nmuseums, has edited the superb _Histoire de l'art_, to which leading\r\nFrench scholars have contributed.[18] And the iconography of French\r\ncathedrals has received no more magistral treatment than from M. Mâle,\r\nto whom is due the credit of establishing the scholastic character of\r\nGothic imagery.[19] His path was cleared by pioneers such as Didron,\r\nCrosnier, Martin, and Duchesne.\r\n\r\nHappily for the local schools, a bevy of intelligent churchmen have\r\ndevoted themselves to their regional monuments. I hope I may be pardoned\r\nif I do not name each with his ecclesiastical designation, but cite them\r\nhere simply as savants: the Abbés Eugène Müller (Senlis); Bourassé and\r\nBosseboeuf (Touraine); Ledru (Le Mans); Auber, De la Croix, and Mgr.\r\nBarbier de Montault (Poitiers); Chomton (Dijon); Bulteau (Chartres);\r\nAbgrall (Brittany); Maurin (Aix-en-Provence); Bouvier (Sens); Cerf\r\n(Rheims); Bouxin (Laon); and for the Norman churches, the Abbés Fossey,\r\nPorée, Loisel, and Pigéon.\r\n\r\nThe list might be greatly extended. One can cite only a few. From the\r\npages of such students have been written these chapters, by one who has\r\nfelt that there must be many travelers who love the old cathedrals of\r\nEurope and have wandered among them puzzled by half-understood things,\r\nlonging to know with exactitude how and when they were built. So it has\r\nnot seemed a useless task to gather into these ten chapters what the\r\nFrench scholars are relating of their churches. So swiftly do\r\narchæological discoveries follow one another to-day, that statements\r\naccepted now may be obsolete to-morrow. The makers of history and art\r\nbooks can hope to serve only their hour.\r\n\r\nThe new school of Christian archæology is redeeming the misrepresented\r\ncenturies after the year 1000. It is undoing the systematic\r\nfalsification of history, and is teaching us to read the past other than\r\nby the printed page. Not hate, but love, opens new windows in the soul.\r\nThe study of the churches of France adds flesh and blood to many a mere\r\nname in history. One gains a very special liking for little Abbot Suger,\r\nmost dependable of men, whose life was a succession of big undertakings.\r\nOne feels reverent affection for that sentinel of the Church and its\r\nguide, Bernard of Clairvaux, who said some harsh things of fine\r\nchurches, all the while that he was feeding the mystic life that made\r\nthem inevitable. And very real become the bishop builders when one knows\r\ntheir cathedrals. One pores over the old volumes of the _Histoire\r\nLittéraire de la France_, begun by XVII-century Benedictines, and still\r\nbeing continued by the Institute of France, to gather details of good\r\nBishop Fulbert and doughty St. Ives, who built at Chartres; of that\r\ndistinguished literary man, Bishop Hildebert de Lavardin, who worked at\r\nLe Mans; of the well-poised Bishop Maurice de Sully, who raised Notre\r\nDame at Paris; of crusading prelates such as Albéric de Humbert, who\r\nbegan Rheims; and of Nivelon de Chérisy, who built Soissons, and who, on\r\nthe Fourth Crusade, played a foremost role. One grows to love, above\r\nall, the saint-king, Louis, truest hero of _la douce France_, who\r\nilluminated his kingdom with fair churches. And no one can admire St.\r\nLouis and not keep a warm corner in his heart for Joinville, his\r\ncomrade-in-arms, the irresistible seneschal of Champagne.\r\n\r\nCrusades and chivalry and all the multicolored aspects of the XII and\r\nXIII centuries become clearer to the imagination as one traces the story\r\nof the cathedrals of France; scholasticism and the early days of the\r\nschools, when Abélard sparred with Guillaume de Champeaux. Very real\r\nthey all become: Peter the Venerable, good Stephen Harding, St. Thomas\r\nBecket, John of Salisbury, St. Edmund Rich, Stephen Langton, St.\r\nDominic, St. Malachy O'Morgair, Innocent III, St. Bonaventure, and St.\r\nThomas Aquinas. France welcomed them all during the two vital centuries\r\nwhen she imposed her literature as well as her architecture on western\r\nEurope, when the Paris schools were the intellectual center of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nTo paint a rose-colored picture of the two best centuries of the Middle\r\nAges would be absurd. They were full of very evil things. There were\r\nhorrifying episodes in them. \"Barbarism tempered by religion; religion\r\ndisfigured by barbarism,\" is the definition of Balmes, the theologian.\r\nThe inconsistencies were gigantic. The same men who sacked\r\nConstantinople in 1204, dealing art a staggering blow, were the very men\r\nwho in western Europe were building cathedrals. Then, as now, there were\r\nmany for whom religion served as a convenient cloak for the lower\r\ninstincts; then, as now, there were many who never lost sight of the\r\nhigher ideals. Side by side with the evil and the self-seeking should be\r\nset the sublime impulses which checked those untutored generations. Do\r\nnot hide the merciless laying waste of Languedoc by the north, but do\r\nnot forget that, in the same hour, men had reached an abnegation of self\r\nthat led them to the African coast as voluntary substitutes for their\r\nbrother Christians in bondage there.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of its human infirmities it was an age that aspired: its\r\npoets sang of the Holy Grail, its kings and its serfs were saints, there\r\nwere saint scholars and barons and merchants, there was even a saint\r\nlawyer.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely the restored balance between good and evil which the\r\nstudy of Gothic art is bringing about. The partisan may go on compiling\r\na police gazette and call it history.[20] While the towers of Gothic\r\nchurches point upward, he is refuted. The modern mind has once for all\r\ngrasped that it is psychologically impossible for an age to have been\r\nsunk in blind superstition when it could build, not merely one or two,\r\nbut hundreds of churches whose every line is an aspiration toward\r\nsanctity. The cathedrals are the true apologetics of the Middle Ages.\r\nArchæology is again proving its claim to be the soul of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAbbot Suger and St. Denis-en-France\r\n\r\n     Under the impulse of this monk, truly great in all things, Gothic\r\n     architecture was born.--FÉLIX DE VERNEILH (of Abbot Suger).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe churches built during the evolution from Romanesque to Gothic have\r\nbeen called transitional, a classification which would be most\r\nconvenient for the amateur, had not archæologists decided it was an\r\nequivocal term. They say that, during the short period when \"Romanesque\r\nand Gothic inhabited under the same roof,\" the Romanesque parts of the\r\nedifice were placed side by side with the simultaneously built Gothic\r\nparts, that there was juxtaposition, but no fusion. Vaults were either\r\nbarrel, groin, or of the diagonal-rib type; there was no such thing as a\r\ntransition form of vault. Arches were either round or pointed; there was\r\nno such thing as a transition or intermediary form of arch. And since\r\nthe radical distinction between Romanesque and Gothic is caused by the\r\nvaulting, it is correct to call that part of a church where was groin or\r\nbarrel vault Romanesque, and that part where were used the intersecting\r\nribs Gothic.\r\n\r\nThe sequence of the passing from Romanesque to Gothic is obscure,\r\nbecause there is a lack of definite dates. From 1110 to 1140, while the\r\nintersecting ribs were coming into use in northern France, such a vault\r\nwas practically the only sign in an edifice of the new movement. The\r\nwalls still were massive, the windows still were small and round-arched,\r\nthe sculpture still was coarse and heavy. Then, as the transition\r\nadvanced, the supports grew lighter, the profiles (those cross-section\r\noutlines of ribs, arches, capitals, and bases) grew purer, and the\r\nsculpture discarded Byzantine traditions and took nature as its model.\r\n\r\nFrench archæologists have thought that the use of diagonals came about\r\nfirst through the desire to hold up some groin vault, on the point of\r\ncollapsing, which would seem a very sensible explanation, since the\r\ncreative genius of the Ile-de-France seems dimly to have apprehended\r\neven in the first hour the stupendous possibility to be drawn from a\r\nmember whose purpose was to concentrate force in order that other parts\r\nof the edifice might be relieved. From the initial hour began the\r\nevolution of the cardinal organ in the Ile-de-France. Whereas the\r\nLombard architects looked on the diagonals as a mere contrivance,\r\nstubbornly keeping their eyes shut to the structural possibilities\r\nlatent therein. The masons of the Ile-de-France at once began to profile\r\ntheir diagonals graciously, and even before the genius of Suger had\r\ncoordinated, at St. Denis, all the foregoing progress of the nascent\r\nart, craftsmen had occasionally symbolized, as it were, the importance\r\nof the intersecting ribs by carving little caryatids for them to rest\r\nupon above the capitals; such figurines are to be seen in the Oise\r\nregion at Bury and at Cambronne.[21]\r\n\r\nMr. Arthur Kingsley Porter's idea is that the transitional period\r\nresolves itself into a series of experiments on the part of the builders\r\nto erect a vault with a minimum of centering, and he cites the hollow\r\nspires at Loches as an experiment to put up a stone roof without the use\r\nof any temporary substructure of wood, which apparently was costly.[22]\r\nHe thinks that the earlier Gothic vaults were _bombé_ because that form\r\nfacilitated construction without centering, and that the Lombards\r\ndropped their precocious diagonals after 1120, as soon as they had\r\nlearned how to build domed groin vaults which required no temporary\r\nwooden substructures. What is of value in Mr. Porter's thesis is sure,\r\nin time, to pass into French currency; until a majority of French\r\narchæologists find his explanation better than their own it is\r\npermissible for us to agree with those who are telling the tale of\r\ntheir own national art.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest extant Gothic vaults in the Ile-de-France are\r\nthose at Acy-en-Multien (Oise) and at Crouy-sur-Ourcq (Seine-et-Marne).\r\nTheir outline is rectangular. Some intersecting ribs at Rhuis (Oise) are\r\ncited by M. Lefèvre-Pontalis as the oldest in the Soissonnais. Diagonals\r\nwere put up, about 1115, at St. Vaast-de-Longmont (Oise), Orgeval\r\n(Seine-et-Oise), Viffort (Aisne), Airaines (Somme), and in other rural\r\nchurches. The famous ambulatory vaults at Morienval were probably built\r\nabout 1122. A year or two earlier, perhaps, are the side-aisle vaults of\r\nSt. Étienne at Beauvais.\r\n\r\nBury (Oise) shows the first extant half dome with ribs. Of the same\r\ntime, about 1125, are the diagonals at Marolles, St. Vaast-les-Mello,\r\nBéthisy-St.-Pierre, Bonneuil-en-Valois, and Bellefontaine, all in the\r\nOise department. Bellefontaine, whose date of 1125 is certain, has\r\nhelped to place other churches of the transition by comparing their\r\ndiagonals with its pointed intersecting ribs. Bruyères (Aisne) is about\r\n1130, Poissy (Seine-et-Oise) and Villetertre (Oise) are about 1135, and\r\nso are the ribs of St. Martin-des-Champs at Paris. In the Aisne region\r\nare Berzy-le-Sec and Laffaux (c. 1140) and in the Oise region is\r\nChelles, building at the hour when Suger undertook St. Denis (Seine),\r\n1140 to 1144. Cambronne (Oise) and Foy-St.-Quentin (Somme) are about\r\n1145. Such churches as Glennes (Aisne), St. Leu d'Esserent (Oise), and,\r\nclose to the latter, Creuil's church of St. Évremont were building in\r\n1150; so were Chars (Seine-et-Oise) and, near it, Pontoise,[23] whose\r\nambulatory vaults some claim are prior to those of the procession path\r\nof St. Denis, and therefore a link between Morienval and Suger's\r\nabbatial. The big church at St. Germer (Oise) was begun about 1150,\r\nthough certain of its features are more archaic than St. Denis, built\r\nbefore it. Some of these churches, called transitional, used wall ribs\r\nfor their diagonals, others omitted them; in some the intersecting ribs\r\nwere pointed, in others, semicircular.\r\n\r\nMr. John Bilson, who contends that diagonals were used in Normandy some\r\ntwenty-five years earlier than in the Ile-de-France, considers the early\r\ndates for these rural churches improbable, that scarcely any were\r\nanterior to St. Denis, that it was a case of little churches following\r\nthe great churches, not vice versa. The earliest, he thinks, was St.\r\nÉtienne at Beauvais (c. 1120), significantly close to Normandy. But\r\nNormandy did not suspect the value and fecundity of diagonals. That feat\r\nof creative genius none can deny to the Ile-de-France.\r\n\r\nThe traveler can do nothing more enlightening and delightful as a\r\nprelude to his journey among French cathedrals than to spend some early\r\nspring days exploring the rural churches of the privileged land of the\r\nnational art which the old geographers chose to picture as an island\r\ninclosed by the Seine, the Marne, the Aisne, and the Oise. Numerous\r\nchurches of the transition lie between Soissons, Senlis, and Beauvais,\r\nand once, around Amiens was another such center, but few of the\r\nmonuments there have survived.[24] Go to Creuil and see, in the ruins of\r\nSt. Évremont, a rudimentary flying buttress--a quarter arch once hidden\r\nunder the lean-to roof. No doubt the architect built it with the\r\nintention of bracing the upper walls, but since he omitted to brace the\r\nflying buttress itself it failed of its purpose. Four miles away, at St.\r\nLeu d'Esserent, is an awkward early trial of a Gothic vault in the\r\ntribune above the porch, but as the ribs are embedded in the cells, no\r\nproper elasticity is achieved. Go to Morienval and study its remarkable\r\nessay in spanning a curving section with diagonals. Trace these early\r\nsteps of the national art, and the meaning of the Gothic bone structure\r\ngrows plainer.\r\n\r\nMORIENVAL[25]\r\n\r\n     I approve the life of those for whom the city is a prison, who find\r\n     paradise in solitude, who live by the works of their hands, or who\r\n     seek to remake their spirit by the sweetness of their contemplative\r\n     life, who drink of the fountain of life by the lips of their heart,\r\n     and forget what is behind them to regard only what lies ahead. But\r\n     neither the most hidden forest nor the highest mountains will give\r\n     happiness to man, if he has not in himself solitude of the spirit,\r\n     peace of conscience, upliftings of the heart to God.--Letter of ST.\r\n     IVES, Bishop of Chartres, 1091-1115.\r\n\r\nOf the experimental steps which led to Gothic art, the most appealing is\r\nthe nunnery church of Morienval, a humble forerunner of Amiens Cathedral\r\nthat has made as much stir in archæological controversy as Périgueux's\r\ncathedral of St. Front itself. Morienval may not be the passionately\r\nsought _oeuvre-initiale_, since its vaults, while they betray\r\ninexperience, certainly were preceded by still cruder attempts, but it\r\ncan boast that it is the first Gothic ambulatory extant, and as the\r\ncurving aisle around the chancel is the most exquisite feature of the\r\ngreat cathedrals, Morienval's humble first essay of it merits a\r\npilgrimage.\r\n\r\nAs one approaches the abbey church it does not appear till one is\r\ndirectly over it, so snugly hidden away is the village in a fold of the\r\nrolling country that skirts the forest of Compiègne. Perhaps the\r\nIX-century nuns who chose the site may have hoped that the marauders of\r\nthat troublous time might ride by, unconscious of booty so close at\r\nhand. With gratitude one learns that the invasion of 1914 has left\r\nMorienval unscathed, as well as those other memorials of tentative\r\nGothic, Acy-en-Multien and Crouy-sur-Ourcq.\r\n\r\nBecause of excellent proportions, the church appears larger than in\r\nreality. The exterior is Romanesque. Two time-stained towers of the XI\r\ncentury mark the angles between transept and choir, an arrangement\r\nderived from Rhenish churches. At the west façade is a beautiful\r\nXII-century tower. It was building while the nuns were proceeding to\r\ntear down a decrepit apse in order to erect the present east end of the\r\nchurch. In that new apse appeared the much-discussed early ribs.\r\n\r\nA record tells that relics were installed in the church in 1122, and it\r\nwas probably then that the new works were finished. Ambulatories had\r\ncome into favor during the first third of the XII century, when need was\r\nfelt for a suitable corridor for pilgrims to encircle the altar whereon\r\nrelics were exposed. Now to vault a curving aisle was no easy task,\r\nowing to the trapeze shape of each section. Morienval's ambulatory must\r\nhave been designed to hold extra altars, since entrance to the aisle is\r\nblocked at both ends by the towers, and the passage is so narrow that\r\nonly one at a time can walk in it. There are no apse chapels. The\r\nsculpture is archaic. Some of the capitals show interlacings, and some\r\nare of the pleated type popular in Normandy. The diminutive corridor has\r\nfour small bays whose clumsy intersecting vault ribs are of the size of\r\nthe average stovepipe. They curve strangely, and two of the keystones\r\nare not in the axis of the passageway, nor has elasticity yet been\r\nwholly achieved, since the ends of the ribs plunge into the web of the\r\nvault.\r\n\r\nOver the choir, consisting of one large bay, are intersecting ribs that\r\nappear to be posterior to those of the ambulatory. They, too, are rude\r\nand large, but are wholly detached from the cells. M. Lefèvre-Pontalis\r\nthinks that the ambulatory diagonals are contemporary, and owe their\r\nmore archaic character to the difficulty of vaulting a curved passage.\r\nSo swiftly did the early architects acquire skill in the new system of\r\nbuilding, that when a chapel was erected on the northern arm of\r\nMorienval's transept, at the end of the XII century, each diagonal had\r\nbecome a single slender torus, virile and graceful.\r\n\r\nOf less architectural importance is the Romanesque nave of Morienval,\r\nwhose meager vault ribs are of the XVII century. The western tower was\r\nthe prototype of the Romanesque belfries of the region and should be\r\npreserved. It is in a deplorable state, propped by beams, which are\r\ngayly scaled by the lads who ring the Angelus. Little Morienval has the\r\nhuman touch which the traveler craves. Set in the wall above the\r\nXIII-century lord of Viri's tomb are tablets that commemorate two\r\npastors of this isolated Valois village who were heroes as valiant as\r\nany crusader. Their combined ministry covered a hundred and one years.\r\nThe first died in 1840, after fifty-seven years of service here,\r\n\"faithful to his duty in times most difficult,\" and difficult indeed was\r\na priest's life during the Revolution. \"Pray for his soul,\" begs his\r\ngrateful commune, to which he had bequeathed the presbytery and all his\r\nsavings.\r\n\r\nHis successor came to Morienval in his 'twenties, fresh from Paris, his\r\nbirthplace, and on this dwindling village he expended his energies for\r\nforty-five years. Abbé Riaux loved his parishioners like a father, and\r\nwas, says the memorial tablet, \"physician for body as well as soul.\"\r\nDuring the cholera of 1849 his self-denial elicited a gold medal from\r\nMorienval and the village of Bonneuil, where is another primitive essay\r\nof a Gothic vault. \"The state of decay of his beautiful church made him\r\nsuffer,\" runs the inscription, so he willed his modest fortune toward\r\nits restoration. Happily, he lived long enough to see the church he\r\nloved become a savant's shrine. It was in 1880 that M. Robert de\r\nLasteyrie first drew attention to Morienval as an early step in the\r\ntardily understood national art, and MM. Anthyme Saint-Paul, Eugène\r\nLefèvre-Pontalis, and Camille Enlart joined in the debate. The\r\narchæologists' war horse they have called our little Morienval. Such\r\nwidespread discussion and the good priest's bequest fortunately brought\r\nabout a thorough restoration of the choir.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. ÉTIENNE AT BEAUVAIS, AND ST. GERMER[26]\r\n\r\n     Sous le porche de l'église, chacun laisse le fardeau que la vie lui\r\n     impose. Ici le plus pauvre homme s'élève au rang des grands\r\n     intellectuels, des poètes, que dis-je? au rang des esprits: il\r\n     s'installe dans le domaine de la pensée pure et du rêve. Le\r\n     gémissement d'une vieille femme agenouillée dans l'église de son\r\n     village est du même accent, traduit la même ignorance, le même\r\n     pressentiment que la méditation du savant.... De ces parties\r\n     profondes de l'être, de ce domaine obscur surgissent toutes les\r\n     puissances créatrices de l'homme.\r\n\r\n\r\n--MAURICE BARRÈS.[27]\r\n\r\nClose in date to Morienval are the aisle vaults of St. Étienne's nave at\r\nBeauvais, the old city that lies on a tributary of the Oise. The\r\nintersecting ribs are not quite so stout as those of Morienval, but\r\ntheir ends still plunge into the massive, and they, too, are\r\nround-arched; their date is approximately 1120. That they planned at the\r\nsame time to throw similar diagonals over the principal span is proved\r\nby the existent lower structures, but the actual vaults there were not\r\nerected till after a fire in 1180. The transverse arches of the aisles\r\nare noticeably stilted. This device was to lead to a solution of the\r\nproblem how to raise the arches framing each vault section to the level\r\nof the diagonals' crown, and thus avoid the excessive doming which is\r\nfound in the earlier Gothic vaults.\r\n\r\nIn the XII-century north façade of the transept is an oculus big enough\r\nto be called the first rose window; a wheel of fortune it is called,\r\nbecause the images around its circle are an allegory of the fleet\r\npassing of man's greatness. This is one of the very early approaches to\r\npure sculpture. The nave's two westernmost bays and its façade are of\r\nthe XI century. Had the original choir of St. Étienne survived, it is\r\nthought that its ambulatory would be one of the missing steps connecting\r\nthe cramped corridor of Morienval with the double procession path of St.\r\nDenis. The present choir, a Flamboyant Gothic structure, is famous for\r\nits gloriously colored windows, some of which were made by that notable\r\nfamily of local artists who designed the big rose windows of Beauvais\r\nCathedral, Engrand Le Prince and his sons Jean and Nicolas, and his\r\nson-in-law Nicolas Le Pot. The latter carved the cathedral's wooden\r\ndoors, for versatility was characteristic of the artisan-artists of\r\nthose days.\r\n\r\nTen miles from Beauvais, a crawling train sets one down in a field\r\nwhence a two-mile walk leads to the sleepy bourg of St. Germer-en-Flay.\r\nThe abbey was founded in 655 by Germer, a noble of Dagobert's court,\r\nnephew of St. Ouen the great bishop of Normandy's capital. To St.\r\nGermer's abbey came William the Conqueror to beg the French king to join\r\nhim in his proposed descent on England. But Philip I gathered his\r\ncounselors, and it was decided not to support the Norman duke, since, if\r\nhe gained England, he would be richer than his own suzerain, the king of\r\nFrance, and if he failed, France would have antagonized the English.\r\n\r\nThe large abbatial church of St. Germer, if not beautiful, is of\r\narchæological interest. Formerly it was thought to be a monument of\r\n1130, but closer study has shown that it was erected during one bout of\r\nwork from 1150 to 1180. Hard though it was to believe it the\r\ncontemporary of the cathedrals at Senlis and Noyon, its sculpture is too\r\nexcellent to have been done earlier. The crocketed capitals of its\r\nwesternmost bays were never made earlier than 1175. That the church was\r\ncontinued without pause from apse to façade is proved by the unity of\r\nprofiles and details. Its anachronisms are to be explained because it\r\nderived from a side current of Gothic art, out of touch with the\r\nswift-moving main stream, which was channeled by Abbot Suger.\r\n\r\nThe architect of St. Germer showed in the main parts of his church a\r\nthorough understanding of the new Gothic vaulting, and at the same time\r\nhe covered his tribune gallery with Romanesque groins. He made heavy\r\nRomanesque piers, and simultaneously he essayed to disencumber the\r\npavement by employing the corbel, or side bracket. The Norman zigzag or\r\nchevron design decorates the heavy molding of the pier arches. Over the\r\nsanctuary he attempted the inartistic experiment of having his ribs\r\nconverge, not on a keystone, but directly on a transverse rib. The ribs\r\nof the upper vaulting are heavy and ornamented. The pointed arches of\r\nthe pier arcade are surmounted by round arches, in the tribunes. And\r\nbetween tribune and clearstory are square apertures neither Romanesque\r\nnor Gothic.\r\n\r\nTo meet the thrust of the upper vaulting, some rudimentary flying\r\nbuttresses were built under the lean-to roof of the tribune galleries,\r\nbut as they themselves were not braced, they remained ineffectual. The\r\ncollapse of some of the high vaults caused the addition, later, of the\r\npresent flying buttresses. The exterior of the church is gaunt, with\r\nwindows that are small and round-arched. The west façade was wrecked\r\nduring the Hundred Years' War, and never restored. Walled-up arches mar\r\nthe spacious interior. Thick coats of whitewash cover it, and when dust\r\ngathers on that make-shift of cleanliness the effect is tawdry. Directly\r\nbehind the apse of the big abbatial stands a masterpiece of Rayonnant\r\nGothic, a diminutive church whose west façade faces, with awkward\r\ncloseness, the back of the larger church. As it is connected with the\r\nlatter's ambulatory by a glazed passage, it may be regarded as a sort of\r\nLady chapel. Many such imitations of the Sainte-Chapelle of Paris arose,\r\nafter St. Louis had made his shrine for the crown of thorns. The abbot\r\nwho put up St. Germer's glass reliquary was Pierre Wesencourt, who\r\nruled from 1254 to 1272, and it is thought that the king's own architect\r\ndesigned it. That Louis IX contributed toward it is shown by the\r\nfleur-de-lis and the donjons of Castile in the storied windows. Over the\r\naltar once stood the alabaster retablo, depicting St. Germain's life,\r\nnow in the Musée Cluny, at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISSY[28]\r\n\r\n     Christianity is still for 400,000,000 of human beings the great\r\n     pair of wings that are indispensable if man is to rise above\r\n     himself, above humdrum living and shut-in horizons, it is still the\r\n     spiritual guide to lead him by patience, resignation, and hope to\r\n     serenity, to lift him by purity, temperance, and goodness to the\r\n     heights of devotion and self-sacrifice. Always and everywhere for\r\n     nineteen hundred years as soon as these wings flag or break, public\r\n     and private manners degenerate. Neither philosophy, reason, nor\r\n     artistic and literary culture, nor even feudal honor, military and\r\n     chivalrous, no code, no administration, no government can serve as\r\n     substitute for it.--H. TAINE (1892).\r\n\r\nThe church of St. Louis, at Poissy, is a link in the normal development\r\nof Gothic, and not like St. Germain, a disconcerting anachronism. About\r\n1135 both systems of vaults were here built at one and the same time.\r\n\r\nPoissy lies on the Seine slightly above its junction with the classic\r\nOise. A pleasant way to approach it is to walk from St. Germain-en-Laye\r\nthrough the forest, when it is carpeted with anemones. St. Germain's\r\npalace chapel is thought to be the work of Pierre de Montereau. One goes\r\nto Poissy in a spirit of pilgrimage, for at its font, in 1215, St. Louis\r\nof France was baptized.[29] He held the gift of Christian citizenship he\r\nhere received above all that the world could bestow. To his intimates he\r\noften signed himself Louis of Poissy. His grandfather, Philippe-Auguste,\r\nhad given the manor of Poissy to his son, on his marriage to Blanche of\r\nCastile. Living then in retirement at Poissy was the gentle Agnes of\r\nMéran, that aunt of St. Elizabeth of Hungary whom Philippe-Auguste had\r\nbeen forced by Rome's decree to set aside. When St. Louis was born, on\r\nSt. Mark's Day of 1215, in order to spare the young mother, the church\r\nbells were silent. The Spanish princess asked the cause, and\r\nordered--gallant woman that she was--that every bell in the town should\r\nring out a joyous carillon because God had given her _un beau fils_.\r\nShakespeare would inevitably admire Blanche; she was a Shakespearian\r\ncharacter:\r\n\r\n    That daughter there of Spain, the hardy Blanche,\r\n    Is near to England; look upon the years\r\n    Of Louis the Dauphin and that lovely maid.\r\n    If lusty love should go in search of beauty,\r\n    Where shall he find it fairer than in Blanche?\r\n    If jealous love should go in search of virtue,\r\n    Where shall he find it purer than in Blanche?\r\n    If love ambitious sought a match of birth,\r\n    Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanche?[30]\r\n\r\nThe wide ambulatory of Poissy is groin-vaulted, but diagonals cover the\r\ntwo oriented apsidioles that open on a false transept, which arrangement\r\nof pseudo-transept with chapels was copied soon after at Sens. The three\r\neasternmost bays of the nave have retained their primitive intersecting\r\nribs, which are round-arched, decorated, and very broad, as are the\r\ntransverse arches that separate the vault into sections. Poissy's\r\nsculpture is of an advanced type. Owing to later changes, there is much\r\npatchwork in the church.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. DENIS-EN-FRANCE[31]\r\n\r\n    Give all thou canst: high Heaven rejects the lore\r\n    Of nicely calculated less or more:\r\n    So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense\r\n    These lofty pillars, spread this branching roof\r\n    Self-poised.\r\n    --WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Poissy. An Early Example of Gothic Vaulting (c.\r\n1135)_]\r\n\r\nFinally came the hour of the new architecture's clear achievement. After\r\nall the trial efforts, there now was built, midway in the XII century, a\r\nmonument which was to wield momentous influence. With the erection of\r\nSt. Denis, the center of Gothic art may be said to have shifted slightly\r\nsouth, to Paris. From the capital the new movement spread out in\r\nsystematic progression--each church comprehending better than had its\r\npredecessor the principle of thrust and counterthrust, each drawing from\r\nit further consequences.\r\n\r\nSt. Denis did not put a stop abruptly to the coexistence in the same\r\nedifice of both systems of vaulting any more than it began immediately\r\nthe usage of all the consequences of diagonals. Yet none the less the\r\nRoyal Abbey is rightly called the first Gothic monument, since here\r\nfirst was demonstrated stout-heartedly the advantages of the new system.\r\nAbbot Suger was the first to employ the generating member with the full\r\nintelligence of its results. \"From the moment of St. Denis' conception,\r\nAmiens had become inevitable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Suger who wedded definitely the pointed arch and the intersecting\r\nribs. He dared to make piers so slender that the beholders were\r\nastonished they could carry the weight of a stone roof; he dared to open\r\nhis walls by windows so large that his choir was called by the people\r\nthe lantern of St. Denis. The mastery by Suger's craftsmen of the art of\r\nstained glass was to have profound consequences in Gothic structure,\r\nsince it hastened the suppression of the wall screen between the active\r\nmembers: \"Behold I will lay thy stones with fair colors, and thy\r\nfoundations with sapphires; and I will make thy windows of agates, and\r\nthy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.\"\r\n\r\nSuger has himself told us how the house of God, many-colored as the\r\nradiance of precious stones, lifted his soul from the cares of this\r\nworld to divine meditation, for this Gothic art, whose spiritual appeal\r\nhe had apprehended as profoundly as he had its structural laws, was most\r\naptly fashioned to be a foretaste of the Beyond, neither touching the\r\nbaseness of earth nor wholly the serenity of heaven.\r\n\r\nDoubtless Suger understood the importance of the dedication day in 1144.\r\nHe made of it a national ceremony. He started the Gothic movement\r\nintrepidly. Before a historic gathering of bishops and barons he\r\ndemonstrated that a Gothic vault was lighter, more easily built, more\r\neconomical, and more enduring than any other, and the important men of\r\nFrance went back to their own cities to spread far and wide the lesson\r\nthey had learned.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the story of French architecture, fate has most\r\ngraciously allied certain monuments of prime archæological interest with\r\npeople or events of historic importance.\r\n\r\nGothic art made its debut in a unique setting. St. Denis was the patron\r\nof France, the missionary who first preached Christianity by the Seine,\r\nand who there had been martyred in the III century. On Montmartre is the\r\ncrypt said to have been the burial place of the first Christian martyrs\r\nof Paris. In time there rose on the road outside the city a monastery\r\ndedicated to St. Denis, and thither were his relics transferred. Each of\r\nthe three royal lines that have ruled France, Merovingian, Carolingian,\r\nand Capetian, chose the abbey of St. Denis as their final resting place\r\nand loaded it with favors. The first milestone on the highroad of Gothic\r\nart was the famous center of the nation's life, and the initiator of the\r\nnew system of building was the maker of the nation's unity, Abbot Suger.\r\n\r\nTo Suger may be applied the mediæval term for an architect, Master of\r\nWorks, _maître de l'oeuvre_. He wrote an account of how he\r\nreconstructed his abbey, building it, he says, with the aid of his\r\ncompanions in the community and his brothers in the cloister. The people\r\ngave voluntarily of their labor. When a quarry with suitable stone was\r\ndiscovered at Pontoise, the whole countryside--men, women, and children\r\nbeing harnessed to the carts--dragged the blocks in pious enthusiasm to\r\nSt. Denis.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of the martyred patron of Paris was a pilgrim shrine from\r\nearliest days. The same trait in human nature that, in 1915, sent\r\nAmericans to gaze reverently at a relic of their national history, the\r\nLiberty Bell, when on a two weeks' journey from the San Francisco Fair\r\nto Philadelphia, it was exhibited in different cities, made the early\r\nChristians of Gaul flock to revere the relics of the holy man who had\r\nbrought them the light and liberty of the gospel. Religion then and all\r\nthrough the Middle Ages was fraught with patriotism.\r\n\r\nFor St. Denis' abbey a Merovingian church had been built by Dagobert.\r\nPépin and Charlemagne replaced it by a Carolingian church. By the XII\r\ncentury the abbatial had become inadequate for the pilgrim crowds;\r\npeople were crushed to death on festival days, and Abbot Suger decided\r\nto rebuild. He began by demolishing a heavy vestibule which Charlemagne\r\nhad put up as a kind of tomb over his father's grave, for Pépin had\r\nbegged to be buried face downward in penance, before the abbey church.\r\nSuger replaced that encumbering porch by what is to-day a narthex, or\r\nforechurch, formed by the two westernmost bays of the edifice. In the\r\nthirties of the XI century he started the new works. Romanesque feeling\r\nlingered in the sculpture, and the stout vault ribs crossed each other\r\nin round arches. By 1140 the west façade was finished and ceremoniously\r\nconsecrated.\r\n\r\nA month later, a still greater gathering met at St. Denis for the laying\r\nof the corner stone of the choir. To the sound of trumpets, Louis VII\r\ndescended into the trench prepared for the foundation, and placed the\r\nfirst stone, and as the choir chanted of the jeweled walls of the\r\nheavenly city, _Lapides pretiosi omnes muri tui_, the king, profoundly\r\nmoved, took from his finger a costly ring and threw it into the mortar,\r\nwhich had been mixed with holy water. Each baron and bishop, as he laid\r\ndown a stone, did the same. Their vehement faith would turn to literal\r\nmeaning the Psalmist's dream of the celestial city.\r\n\r\nIn his choir, Suger united definitely the pointed arch with the\r\nintersecting ribs, and the ribs, now, were not the heavy ones used in\r\nhis forechurch. All the arches at their crown were brought to the same\r\nheight by a combination of stilting, pointing, or depressing them. In\r\nthe outer aisle of his ambulatory, Suger introduced a fifth rib in each\r\nvault section, which welded the apse chapels with the procession path.\r\nFor his inner aisle he employed what is called the broken-rib vault.\r\nFirst, the keystone was planted in the center and from it branched the\r\nfour ribs, each regardless of making a straight diagonal. This became\r\nthe generally accepted method for vaulting an ambulatory. Every part of\r\nhis edifice Suger supervised with untiring energy. Owing to the waste of\r\nforest trees for machines of war, none of sufficient girth could be\r\nfound for the outer roof covering. Suger lay brooding over this one\r\nnight, then started up impetuously before dawn, took the measurements of\r\nthe beams needed, and himself went into the dense forest. Before nine\r\nthat morning he had found a giant tree; by noon ten others, and the\r\ntimber was hauled in triumph to the abbey.\r\n\r\nAll France was talking of the new works at St. Denis. Never before had\r\nbeen such a gathering of skilled masons and sculptors, of goldsmiths and\r\nglassmakers. St. Denis' school was to direct the glassmakers' art\r\nthrough the second half of the XII century. Little is known of the\r\norigin of that art; the early basilicas of Christian Gaul had made use\r\nof pieces of colored glass framed together, and in the X century figures\r\nwere represented. No work, however, previous to the XII century has\r\nsurvived. For the earlier fenestration the term \"painted glass\" is a\r\nmisnomer, since each piece was colored in the mass, and only a few\r\nblack lines were applied to denote the features, or the folds of the\r\ndraperies. The artists of St. Denis obtained their relief effects by a\r\nskilled juxtaposition of tones; intensity of hue was increased by the\r\nemployment of thick rough leaves of glass. Scarcely any white was used;\r\nin the ancient windows no spots spring out unpleasantly.\r\n\r\nTo St. Denis' school succeeded that of Chartres, which predominated\r\nduring the first part of the XIII century, while its second half was\r\nruled by the school of Paris, when windows of the Sainte-Chapelle type\r\nwere the rule. Gradually the craftsmen gave up their sound tradition\r\nthat a window should be a transparent mosaic, subordinate to its\r\narchitectural setting. They began to treat a window as an isolated\r\npicture and the art declined.\r\n\r\nAbbot Suger's school of glassmakers carried their art to its zenith. Not\r\nall the wonders of XIII-century fenestration equaled the unfathomable\r\nvibrant blue in the background of XII-century windows--a fugitive\r\nmystery whose secret has been entirely lost. The popular fancy was that\r\nSuger ground down sapphires to obtain his magic color.\r\n\r\nAll over the land the church builders desired windows like those of St.\r\nDenis. Suger's own craftsmen went to Chartres to make the three big\r\nlancets in that cathedral's western front. The St. Denis school\r\ninfluenced the superb Crucifixion window in Poitiers Cathedral, and\r\nothers in the cathedrals of Angers and Le Mans and in the Trinité at\r\nVendôme, also the Tree of Jesse window in York Cathedral. And, had the\r\nchoir glass of Notre Dame at Paris survived, it would have been of the\r\nschool of St. Denis.\r\n\r\nSuger wrote inscriptions for his abbey windows to make their symbolism\r\nclearer. Owing to the vicissitudes of seven hundred years, few of the\r\nSt. Denis lights have survived. Four are now reset in the central apse\r\nchapel and in that to its north. In a medallion at the base of one of\r\nthese windows Suger himself is represented holding a scroll bearing his\r\nname. The medallion figures are of the hieratic Byzantine type. Every\r\nwindow has a closely woven pattern; each losenge has its own border, and\r\na rich jeweled border surrounds the whole lancet. Bracing bars of iron\r\nrun straight across the pictured story. Slowly, with infinite patience,\r\nworked those old XII-century artists, and never has their handicraft\r\nbeen surpassed as sheer splendor of ornamentation.\r\n\r\nAfter three years and three months of passionate work, the choir of St.\r\nDenis was finished, and on June 11, 1144, the dedication day, the relics\r\nwere installed. That date, forever memorable in the annals of\r\narchitecture, may be called the consecration of the national art. At the\r\nceremony assisted Louis VII with his queen, Aliénor of Aquitaine, whose\r\nstrange destiny was to make her patroness of that entirely different\r\nphase of Gothic called the Plantagenet school. The chief barons were\r\npresent at the dedication, as well as five archbishops and some fourteen\r\nbishops. They looked and wondered, and not a few of them returned home\r\nto imitate. The bishops of Noyon and Senlis hastened to rebuild their\r\ncathedrals in the new way, and some of Suger's masons passed into the\r\nservice of the former prelate. Bishop Geoffrey de Lèves went back to\r\nChartres to build the most beautiful tower in the world, and the\r\nsculptors who had made Suger's western portals (now no longer extant)\r\nworked on the three west doors of Chartres.\r\n\r\nOn the day of St. Denis' dedication, Abbot Suger, small and frail in\r\nperson, but towering in personality, was honored on every side. When the\r\nabbot of great Cluny, Peter the Venerable, passed from the marvels of\r\nthe new church to Suger's narrow cell, he cried out in honest distress:\r\n\"This man condemns us all. He builds, not for himself, but for God\r\nalone!\"\r\n\r\nThough the last half of Suger's life was an example of monastic\r\nsimplicity, not always had he been content with a monk's cell. Perhaps\r\nbecause of his conversion midway in life, he appeals to us in a more\r\nhuman way. Not that he was converted from evil doings; his purpose\r\nalways was high. But in his position as St. Denis' abbot, as a powerful\r\nfeudal lord, he lived sumptuously, according to the accepted standards\r\nof the time. He mixed freely in the world; he directed state affairs for\r\nthe king to whom he was devoted; he went on embassies; he even led\r\narmies. In 1124, when an irate German emperor was marching on Rheims,\r\nwhich he had vowed to destroy, Suger in person led against him some ten\r\nthousand of his abbey's retainers. That was the first time the oriflamme\r\nof St. Denis was carried as the national emblem.[32] Suger had grown up\r\nin the secular atmosphere of the Royal Abbey, and took its worldliness\r\nas a matter of course.\r\n\r\nOf peasant parentage himself, he had been brought, a child of ten, to\r\nlive with the monks, because he already showed exceptional qualities.\r\nAmong his fellow students in the abbey school was the king's son, the\r\nfuture Louis VI, and an intimacy began between the two lads destined to\r\ncontinue till death. When Suger became a monk he was sent on notable\r\nmissions, for he was gifted with tact and good manners, vivacity and\r\ncharm. Sweetness of disposition, mental energy, courage, and absolute\r\nintegrity won for him general esteem. Early and often this born lover of\r\nthings beautiful made the journey into Italy. It was while returning\r\nfrom one of his missions there, in 1122, that he learned of his election\r\nas abbot by his fellow monks in St. Denis. Louis VI had come to the\r\nthrone; henceforth Suger was to lead in all state affairs.\r\n\r\nThe genius of this son of field workers had pierced to the vital need of\r\nthe age--unity of government. Only a strong, central administration\r\ncould cope with the disintegration which was feudalism. For its very\r\nexistence the feudal system depended on the absence of well-enforced\r\ngeneral laws. It was Suger's strong hand that guided the early steps\r\ntoward national unity, and king and people worked for it together. Under\r\nthe king whom Suger served France began her great role of redresser of\r\nwrongs. Louis VI was the first to use the title, king of France, not\r\nking of the Franks. The ideal of this XII-century statesman was a strong\r\ncentral monarchy, coexistent with a national assembly. His high\r\nconception of solidarity was to fructify, within a hundred years, under\r\nPhilippe-Auguste, the grandson of Suger's master.\r\n\r\nSuger was one of the first in Europe to understand political economy. He\r\nlaid the base of a sound financial administration. His confirmation of a\r\ncharter for the townsmen of St. Denis gave security to trade; he\r\nrelieved the abbey serfs of _mainmorte_, built a Villeneuve for homeless\r\nnomads, and found time to study agriculture scientifically. In his\r\nwritings we feel the first breath of a national patriotism. A new note\r\nin that age of unfettered personal impulse when might meant right, was\r\nSuger's constant reference to \"the poor weighed down with taxations,\" to\r\n\"that which has been too long neglected, the care of the surety of\r\nlaborers, of artisans, and of the poor.\" Many a modern politician could\r\nwell ponder Suger's censure of the spoils system. \"The officers\r\ndismissed carry off what they can lay their hands on,\" he said, \"and\r\nthose who replace them, fearing to be likewise treated, hasten to steal,\r\nto secure their fortune.\"\r\n\r\nSuger's pre-eminence in public affairs continued during two reigns.\r\nLouis VII, after stumbling some years without guidance, turned to his\r\nfather's counselor and, during his absence on the Second Crusade,\r\nappointed him regent of France. So masterly was the abbot's rule that\r\nking and people publicly proclaimed him _Père de la Patrie_. Suger\r\nstudied the causes of the crusade's lamentable failure; he felt that\r\nforethought and prudence might win success, and, though he was seventy\r\nyears of age, he began preparations to carry out a crusade at his own\r\nexpense. Time was not given him again to prove his genius for\r\nleadership. When news of his death (1151) reached the court, the king\r\nand the Grand Master of the Templars, who was with him, burst into\r\ntears. On his grave in the abbey church which he had built they cut the\r\nsimple inscription, \"Here lies Abbot Suger.\" No need of panegyric. \"The\r\nsingle names are the noblest epitaphs.\"\r\n\r\nThe commanding place held by this monk in the estimation of Europe is\r\nvouched for by letters from pope, kings, and many a dignitary. The king\r\nof Sicily wrote to beg a line from him; the king of Scotland sent gifts;\r\nthe bishop of Salisbury made the journey to France expressly to know\r\nSuger. By one clear stroke after another--and above all by his own\r\nwritings--every line of which is of historical value--the picture is\r\nfilled in of this admirable churchman who was as soundly honest and\r\nforceful as the architecture he fostered, and whose delicate, ardent\r\nsoul accomplished remarkable things with the reasoned orderliness of the\r\nart he loved.\r\n\r\nSuger's sudden but thorough conversion is attributed to St. Bernard. Up\r\nto middle life he had been a type of those who soar as high as human\r\nabilities can reach without super natural aid. Entangled in the mesh of\r\nvarious employments, his soul could not rise to heavenly things. Then\r\nthe trumpet of Bernard's reform sounded in Europe. Men's hearts were set\r\non fire with repentance and aspiration toward the highest. Bernard's\r\nclear eyes read beneath the outer circumstance of Abbot Suger's life. He\r\nsaw that here was a good man, capable of becoming a holy one. He wrote\r\nfearless words of disapproval. \"One would think it was a governor of a\r\nprovince, not of souls,\" he wrote, when he saw the abbot of St. Denis\r\nride by with sixty horsemen.\r\n\r\nSuger began to scrutinize his manner of life. Grace touched his soul,\r\npomp was laid aside, and he set about his conversion with the same\r\nthoroughness that he displayed in all his acts. Before reforming his\r\nmonastery, he completely reformed himself. With St. Bernard, who was ten\r\nyears his junior, he was linked in ennobling friendship to the end. \"I\r\nknow profoundly this man,\" Bernard wrote of Suger to the pope, \"and I\r\nknow that he is faithful and prudent in temporal things, that he is\r\nfervent and humble in things spiritual. If there is any precious vase\r\nadorning the palace of the King of Kings, it is the soul of the\r\nvenerable Suger.\" When Suger lay dying, he wrote to St. Bernard: \"Could\r\nI but see your angelic face before I die, I should go with more\r\nconfidence.\" And Bernard, who was to follow in a year, begged that when\r\nSuger reached Paradise he would \"think of him before God.\"\r\n\r\nYet, if the overwhelming saint could change the whole tenor of Suger's\r\nlife, the cultivated little abbot of St. Denis offered a gentle,\r\nstubborn opposition to the puritanic ideas of Bernard in the domain of\r\nart. \"Vanity of vanities,\" cried the ascetic, in the well-known open\r\nletter in which he denounced the new luxury in church building. Churches\r\nwere made too long, he complained, too high, and needlessly wide; the\r\ncapitals were carved with monsters more apt to distract than to lead to\r\npious recollection.\r\n\r\nThe art lover in St. Denis' abbey smiled at such iconoclastic vehemence.\r\nSuger thought that nothing was too precious for the house of God. He\r\nproceeded to erect an abbey church as imposing as a cathedral, and to\r\nenrich its treasury with goldsmith work. Over the three gilt-bronze\r\nentrance doors of his church he inscribed, \"The soul on its earthly\r\npilgrimage rises by material things to contemplate the Divine.\" To this\r\nday both men have vigorous partisans, and those who set out on a\r\ncathedral tour in France are more likely to be on Suger's side in the\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nSuger's subtle mind reached beyond the ascetic's maxim. Well he knew\r\nthat both saint and art patron were needed, well he knew that Bernard of\r\nClairvaux was as instrumental as himself in the formation of the\r\ncathedral builders. A living example of Christian perfection, Bernard\r\nfortified the faith of all Europe. He might advocate church simplicity,\r\nbut it was not without cause that his apostolate preceded the most\r\nfecund creative period of mankind's art. His impassioned love of God\r\nwarmed the imaginations of the men who began the big Gothic churches.\r\n\r\nWhat remains to-day of the XII-century abbatial built by Suger of St.\r\nDenis? Comparatively little. The lower parts of the west façade and the\r\ntwo first bays of the nave which form a narthex, or vestibule, are his\r\nwork. In the choir, his beautiful ambulatory begins at the third bay of\r\nthe double aisles. There are nine bays of Suger's processional path, and\r\nfrom them radiate seven apse chapels. The pillars that divide the lovely\r\ncurving double passage are the very ones which the generous enthusiasm\r\nof the people dragged from Pontoise, and, in memory of the little abbot,\r\nsome will touch those slender columns with reverential gesture. It was\r\nSuger who created the disposition of the _rond point_ found in its\r\nperfection at St. Denis and copied in the great cathedrals. The crypt\r\nalso is his work, though its nucleus belonged to an underground shrine\r\nbuilt by Abbot Hilduin in the XI century. When Abbot Suger had finished\r\nhis choir, he proceeded to make a new Gothic transept and nave; but of\r\nthem scarcely a vestige remains. Some sculpture at the north door of the\r\ntransept is of the XII century. Whether the construction was faulty, or\r\nwhether the monks desired a more ample church, there was a total\r\nreconstruction of St. Denis' abbatial, a hundred years after Suger's\r\nday.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ST. DENIS OF ST. LOUIS\r\n\r\n    Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,\r\n      With ill-matched aims, the architect who planned\r\n      (Albeit laboring for a scanty band\r\n    Of white-robbed scholars only) this immense\r\n    And glorious work of fine intelligence.\r\n    --WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\nFrom 1231 to 1280, at St. Louis' own expense, the present nave and\r\ntransept of St. Denis were built, and the first bay of the choir as well\r\nas the upper parts of the chevet were reconstructed. Inasmuch as the new\r\nnave was wider than the choir, a canted bay of the latter joined it to\r\nthe transept.\r\n\r\nSt. Denis, as it now appears, presents the noble elegance of Gothic art\r\nin its golden hour. The new transept was made of exceptional width; its\r\naisles and stately piers compose picturesque vistas. The triforium of\r\nthe reconstructed church was glazed, one of the first essays of a\r\nfeature which was to be in general use in the XIV century. To unite\r\ntriforium and clearstory in a brilliant sparkle of color added to the\r\nmagnificence of a church, but it marked a decline in the sound\r\nstructural laws of Gothic. The purpose of a triforium arcade was to\r\nbeautify the plain wall surface necessitated by the lean-to roof over\r\nthe side aisles. When that blind arcade was opened, the lean-to roof of\r\nthe aisles had to be changed to a conical one, which signified an inner\r\nchannel for rain water and the ultimate deterioration of the masonry.\r\nSuger's St. Denis had started the delight in stained glass, and the St.\r\nDenis of St. Louis merely carried out its consequences--the suppression\r\nof wall inclosures. The present upper windows of the abbatial are poor\r\nexamples of Louis-Philippe's day.\r\n\r\nThe architect of Louis IX, Pierre de Montereau, designed St. Denis as we\r\nhave it to-day, so says a record recently unearthed by M. Henri\r\nStein.[33] He was an innovator who here first accentuated the upward\r\nsweep of Gothic lines. To that XIII-century master they attributed for a\r\ntime the Sainte-Chapelle of the king's palace in the Cité, but now that\r\nit is certain that he planned St. Denis, it is doubted if he made the\r\nSainte-Chapelle, as there is little kinship between the two. There is a\r\ndecided likeness between St. Denis and the chapel of the palace at St.\r\nGermain-en-Laye, and also with the Lady chapel of St. Germer-en-Flay.\r\nPierre de Montereau was buried in 1267 in a now-destroyed\r\nSainte-Chapelle which he had erected within the monastery inclosure of\r\nSt. Germain-des-Prés, at Paris.\r\n\r\nBoth Montereau and Montreuil claim this distinguished master. Probably\r\nhe was born in the former town on the border of Champagne, as his church\r\nat St. Denis shows a trait of that region, the gallery of circulation\r\nunder the windows of the side aisles. Moreover, two of his abbot patrons\r\ncame from Montereau. The architect Eudes de Montreuil, whom St. Louis\r\ntook with him on his first crusade, and who worked on the fortresses of\r\nAigues-Mortes and Jaffa, was a son of Pierre de Montereau, it is\r\nsupposed, and his name should be spelled in the same way.\r\n\r\nNo tomb in St. Denis' abbey church predates the XIII century. To honor\r\nKing Dagobert, founder of the abbey, St. Louis put up an elaborate\r\nmonument and ordered the effigies that distinguish his royal\r\npredecessors' graves. With the tombstone of St. Louis' son, Philip the\r\nBold, began portrait work. An exact likeness of Charles V, the good\r\nValois king, was made by his Flemish sculptor, André Beauneveu, and of\r\nalmost too great realism is that of his general Bertran Duguesclin, whom\r\nKing Charles ordered buried with royal honors in the national\r\nnecropolis.\r\n\r\nIt was the XVI century that added to St. Denis' the three tombs of most\r\narchitectural pretensions, those of Louis XII, Francis I, and Henry II.\r\nThe monument of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany was undertaken (1516-32)\r\nby Jean Juste, who with his brothers had come north from Florence, being\r\namong the first to bring into France the ideals of the Renaissance.[34]\r\nIt has been suggested that the king's and queen's kneeling images are\r\nfrom the studio at Tours of Guillaume Regnault, who for forty years was\r\nco-worker with Michel Colombe, last of the great Gothic artists. The\r\npriants are still quite French in treatment. Jean Juste made the gisants\r\nand his brother and nephew aided with the lesser sculpture. It was Louis\r\nXII who ordered artists at Genoa to make, in 1502, the Carrara marble\r\ntomb of his father, the poet-duke, Charles d'Orléans, and of his\r\ngrandfather, the murdered duke of Orléans, builder of Pierrefonds\r\nCastle, and son of the art-loving Valois king, Charles V.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Francis I (1549-59) was designed by Philibert de Lorme.\r\nPierre Bontemps fashioned the bas-reliefs that celebrate the wars in\r\nItaly; he and other masters made the _priants_ and _gisants_. The tomb\r\nof Henry II and Catherine de Medici (1570) of less artistic value, has a\r\ncomplicated history. The Italian, Primatici, directed the works;\r\nDomenico Florentino made the king's kneeling figure, and Germain Pilon\r\nhis _gisant_; Jerome della Robbia chiseled the queen's death image.\r\n\r\nTo sum up: there are in St. Denis' abbatial three totally different\r\nparts, built in different periods. There is Suger's forechurch, in which\r\nlinger Romanesque echoes; there is the ambulatory of purest Primary\r\nGothic built a little later by the same great abbot; and finally there\r\nare nave, transept, and the main parts of the choir erected during the\r\nreign of St. Louis in the zenith of Gothic art.\r\n\r\nAs one stands in the center of the church, gazing along its vaulting, it\r\nis easy to perceive that the axis is broken three times, and each\r\ndivergence from the straight line conforms to one of the different\r\nstages of work. The deviation of the axis line once was called\r\npoetically _inclinato capite_ (_et inclinato capite, emisit\r\nspiritum_--St. John xix:30). It was thought to symbolize the inclining\r\nof Christ's head on the Cross. When M. Robert de Lasteyrie proved that a\r\nconstructive miscalculation was the cause of the irregular line, the\r\nbeautiful idea had to be renounced.[35] In each successive addition to a\r\nchurch it was difficult for the architect to start the new part exactly\r\non the same axis as the old, since usually a temporary wall shut off the\r\nportion of the church already finished and in use. The slightest\r\nmiscalculation at the start led to a very apparent deflection of\r\nalignment. Those churches which show irregular alignment are known to\r\nhave been built in successive stages. A number of church choirs slant to\r\nthe south, whereas were the figure on the crucifix taken as model they\r\nwould deviate to the north. In churches without a transept, or, in other\r\nwords, churches that lack the extended arms of the cross, is sometimes\r\nfound a decided slant to the north. Moreover, the crucifix of that epoch\r\nrepresented a triumphant Christ with erect head, for the art of the\r\nXIII century was serene; the pathetic in religious iconography was a\r\nlater development. No writer of the period mentions a symbolic\r\ninterpretation of the deviated axis, not even Bishop Guillaume Durandus,\r\nin his noted _Rationale_, or _Signification of the Divine Offices_.\r\nThere is, instead, a text of the XIV century which says that a certain\r\narchitect was so chagrined at having built a tortuous axial line that he\r\nnever returned to be paid by the cathedral chapter. Mr. Arthur Kingsley\r\nPorter thinks that the deviation of the axis was intentionally done, in\r\norder to overcome that tendency of perspective which lessens the\r\napparent length of a church by foreshortening its far bays. By slanting\r\nthe east end, the distant bays could be brought into view, and thus the\r\nedifice would seem longer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _St. Denis-en-France and Its Royal Mausoleums_]\r\n\r\nThe Royal Abbey of St. Denis suffered during the Hundred Years' War,\r\nfrom which period dates the crenelated wall at the birth of the towers.\r\nIn those checkered times the silver tombs of St. Louis, of his father\r\nLouis VIII, and of his grandfather Philippe-Auguste, disappeared. In the\r\nXVI-century religious wars the abbey was pillaged, and its library, a\r\nnational treasure, was burned. The Calvinists carried off Suger's altar\r\nvessels of silver and gold, on which the learned little abbot had\r\ninscribed Latin verses. The Revolution completed the havoc; of the\r\nmonks' quarters nothing remains to-day. The Committee of Public Safety\r\nvoted to destroy the tombs of \"our ancient tyrants\" on the first\r\nanniversary of the August 10th that had unseated the monarchy. So the\r\nmob sallied forth to St. Denis and scattered the dust of the patriot\r\nSuger, whose life work had been the public weal, and the dust of St.\r\nLouis, the most conscientious man who ever ruled a nation and the first\r\nto give France her written laws. The gruesome account of the wrecking of\r\nthe royal tombs was written by an eyewitness.[36]\r\n\r\nIn the opening years of the XVIII century, the abbey church was\r\ndescribed by Chateaubriand as in a ruinous state, with the rain falling\r\nthrough its roof and grass growing on the broken altars: \"The birds use\r\nits nave as a passageway; little children play with the bones of mighty\r\nmonarchs. St. Denis is a desert.\" Napoleon began its restoration, and\r\nmany of the scattered tombs were brought back. During the first half of\r\nthe XIX century some deplorably bad work was carried on, and the robust\r\nprimitive profiles were chiseled away. No sooner was the spire on the\r\nnorth tower finished than cracks showed, and the tower was dismantled to\r\nthe level of the roof. Later changes have repaired some of the stupidity\r\nof those tasteless renovators.\r\n\r\nThe very history which had been enacted within the walls of the great\r\nabbatial would suffice to make it a national relic. To the\r\nPrimary-Gothic church which Suger was building came Louis VII for the\r\noriflamme, the banner carried before the army in momentous wars. He\r\nshared bed and board with the monks the night before he set forth on the\r\nSecond Crusade. To the same early-Gothic church, in 1190, came his son\r\nPhilippe-Auguste, to receive the oriflamme for the Third Crusade. The\r\nflame-colored abbey gonfalon on its gold lance flouted the German\r\nemperor when Bouvines' great victory was won in 1214. At the funeral of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste, in 1223, a little lad of eight marched to St. Denis'\r\nbehind his grandfather's bier. It was the first time that the populace\r\nhad beheld their future saint-king, and an old record tells how his\r\nnoble bearing gladdened their hearts. At his side walked Jean de\r\nBrienne, king of Jerusalem, leader of the recent Fifth Crusade. When St.\r\nLouis came to St. Denis for the oriflamme in 1247, it was to find a\r\ntotally reconstructed church, for Pierre de Montereau had been many\r\nyears at work. Joinville in his memoirs described the landing in Egypt\r\nof the Royal Abbey's banner, how for miles the sea was dotted with the\r\ngleaming ships of the crusaders, how the king, standing head and\r\nshoulders above the rest, on perceiving that the leading vessel which\r\nbore the oriflamme had touched shore, leaped into the sea, sword in\r\nhand, with the cry, \"Montjoye St. Denis!\" And uttering the same battle\r\ncry of France, princes and knights followed. Five years later, tested by\r\ndefeat and imprisonment, as fine gold is by fire, Louis IX brought back\r\nthe oriflamme to St. Denis. Again he returned for it in 1270 for his\r\nlast crusade. Within a year, the whole nation, in mourning, came out to\r\nthe abbey. In a reliquary, the king's bones, embalmed with fragrant\r\nspices, had been brought from Tunis, and the new king bore the _châsse_\r\nsolemnly, and wherever he paused, on the way from Notre Dame to St.\r\nDenis, a memorial cross was erected. But, to give the annals of the\r\nabbey church would be to tell the history of the French monarchy.\r\n\r\nThe first time that the gonfalon of St. Denis was carried against\r\nFrenchmen was in 1413, two years before the defeat at Agincourt, in the\r\nblack days of the Hundred Years' War, days as fatal to the builders' art\r\nas to the civic life of France. What those dire times were that rent\r\nFrance to shreds, and how _la fille de Lorraine à nulle autre pareille_\r\ncame to the rescue, have been sung by a poet whose high destiny it was\r\nto fall in recent battle. Charles Péguy, in his poem, linked the\r\nmomentous epochs of the capital: St. Denis, who brought the Light; Ste.\r\nGeneviève, the sentinel patroness of Paris, who guarded it, and Jeanne\r\nd'Arc, who lifted up the torch from the mire--the torch which the fallen\r\nheroes of the World War have passed on refulgent.\r\n\r\nIn the V century it was at Geneviève's instigation that a basilica was\r\nraised to honor St. Denis. In the XV century Jeanne d'Arc paid tribute\r\nto the first martyr of Paris. Her troops lodged in the town of St.\r\nDenis, then moved in closer to Paris, and in a shrine dedicated to St.\r\nDenis, in the village of La Chapelle, Jeanne heard Mass, the morning\r\nthat she led the assault on the walls of Paris, September 8, 1429. When\r\nwounded she was carried back to La Chapelle (to-day a dense industrial\r\nfaubourg of the city), and on St. Denis' altar she offered tribute.\r\nDuring her trial at Rouen they asked her what arms she had offered to\r\nSt. Denis.[37]\r\n\r\n\"A complete knight's outfit in white, with a sword that I had won before\r\nParis,\" was Jeanne's reply. \"And why did you make that offering?\" asked\r\nthe judge, bent on twisting her every act to sorcery. Jeanne answered\r\nhardily: \"For devotion, and because it is the custom for all men-of-arms\r\nwhen they are merely wounded thus to give thanks. Having been wounded\r\nbefore Paris, I offered my arms to St. Denis because his is the cry of\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nBut let Charles Péguy speak, he who fell between Belgium and Paris in\r\nAugust, 1914:[38]\r\n\r\n    Comme Dieu ne fait rien que par miséricordes,\r\n    Il fallut qu'elle [Ste. Geneviève] vît le royaume en lambeaux,\r\n    Et sa filleule ville embrasée aux flambeaux,\r\n    Et ravagée aux mains des plus sinistres hordes;\r\n\r\n    Et les coeurs dévorés des plus basses discordes,\r\n    Et les morts poursuivis jusque dans les tombeaux,\r\n    Et cent mille innocents exposés aux corbeaux,\r\n    Et les pendus tiront la langue au bout des cordes;\r\n\r\n    Pour qu'elle vît fleurir la plus grande merveille\r\n    Que jamais Dieu le père en sa simplicité\r\n    Aux jardins de sa grâce et de sa volonté\r\n    Ait fait jaillir par force et par necessité;\r\n\r\n    Après neuf cent vingt ans de prière et de veille,\r\n    Quand elle vit venir vers l'antique cité ...\r\n    La fille de Lorraine à nulle autre pareille ...\r\n    Gardant son coeur intact en pleine adversité,\r\n    Masquant sous sa visière une efficacité,\r\n    Tenant tout un royaume en sa ténacité,\r\n    Vivant en pleine mystère avec sagacité,\r\n    Mourant en plein martyre avec vivacité ...\r\n    Jetânt toute une armée aux pieds de la prière.[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSome of the Primary Gothic Cathedrals: Noyon, Senlis, Sens, Laon,\r\nSoissons\r\n\r\n    _C'est vers le Moyen Âge énorme et délicat,_\r\n    _Qu'il faudrait que mon coeur en panne naviguât._\r\n    _ ... Roi, politicien, moine, artisan, chimiste,_\r\n    _Architecte, soldat, médecin, avocat,_\r\n    _Quel temps! Oui, que mon coeur naufragé rembarquât._\r\n    _Pour toute cette force ardente, souple, artiste!..._\r\n    _Guidé par la folie unique de la Croix_\r\n    _Sur tes ailes de pierre, ô folle Cathédrale!_\r\n      --PAUL VERLAINE, _Sagesse_, IV.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nSt. Denis' abbatial was an object lesson in the new art, and the bishops\r\nreturned to their dioceses to emulate it. Two of Suger's personal\r\nfriends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis, were the first to rebuild\r\ntheir cathedrals. Already during the Romanesque stage the cathedral of\r\nSens had been initiated; it now was to be carried on according to the\r\nnew system of building. At Laon was begun a splendid Gothic edifice. At\r\nSoissons, a new cathedral was started by that masterpiece of Primary\r\nGothic, the transept's southern arm. And many a lesser church now rose:\r\nthe collegiate at Braine, the abbey church of St. Leu d'Esserent, and\r\ntwo abbatials in Champagne as imposing as cathedrals, St. Remi at\r\nRheims, and Notre Dame at Châlons-sur-Marne. Also in Champagne is the\r\nPrimary Gothic church of St. Quiriace at Provins.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Paris was also begun in the primary stage of the\r\nnational art. But Notre Dame of Paris must have a chapter to itself.\r\nBefore its main parts were completed, Gothic architecture had reached\r\nits culminating point. With it ended the primary group and opened what\r\nwe shall call the Era of the Great Cathedrals, though let it be\r\nremembered that all such divisions are arbitrary and made use of merely\r\nfor clearness. From its first assured steps to its apogee, from the\r\nmiddle of the XII century to the middle of the XIII, the sequence of\r\nGothic architecture is welded too logically to be defined by\r\ncut-and-dried nomenclature.\r\n\r\nDuring the XII century, the Gothic cathedrals retained Romanesque\r\nfeatures, such as deep tribunes over the side aisles, which gave them a\r\nwall elevation in four stories--pier arcade, tribune, triforium (to veil\r\nthe lean-to roof over the tribune), and clearstory. At first it was\r\ncommon usage to encircle the clustered shafts at intervals with stone\r\nrings, but by the XIII century the desire for an unbroken ascending line\r\nhad grown stronger, and the employment of such horizontal bands died\r\nout. The simultaneous use of both round and pointed arch is found in all\r\nfive of these Primary cathedrals; but after the opening of the XIII\r\ncentury, semicircular and equilateral arches rarely were used at the\r\nsame time in a church. Slowly, as if with reluctance, the new\r\narchitecture dropped favorite traits of the old school. Sculpture\r\ncontinued longest faithful to Romanesque traditions.\r\n\r\nNoyon, Senlis, Sens, Laon, and Soissons--it seems rash to treat of such\r\na bevy of churches in one chapter, when students have made a single\r\ncathedral their life work. The passing traveler is encouraged by one\r\nfact: each big French church, once seen, remains a clear-cut memory, for\r\neach possesses a distinct personality. To confuse one cathedral with\r\nanother is impossible.\r\n\r\nIt is an instinct deeper than mere fancy to choose a season æsthetically\r\nright for a first visit to such sanctuaries. For these Primary\r\ncathedrals the fitting occasion is that fugitive hour when the leaves\r\nare multiple yet half transparent still, only partly veiling the virile\r\nframework of the tree. In them is the evanescence of spring, the\r\nslenderness of adolescence and its virginal restraint, that something of\r\nyouth's severity, that something of youth's radiance which is joy, but\r\nnot abandonment to joy.\r\n\r\nThere is something sacred in the modest sobriety of the earlier Gothic\r\nchurches.... But what words can express their unimaginable charm! If all\r\ntrue art is but a symbol, a prefiguring of the mystery, these churches\r\nveil and reveal the coming harmonies of the Beyond as it never before\r\nwas revealed and veiled. We speak of Chartres as a recollected holiness;\r\nthe stones of Rheims were made majestic for royal pageants; Amiens is a\r\n_sursum corda_. And yet there is something in the first fugitive hour\r\nwhen Romanesque and Gothic met that makes a deeper appeal to the soul.\r\nNo Greek, in portico or sepulchral tablet, conceived beauty of lovelier\r\nproportion, of more heart-piercing simplicity, than some of the earlier\r\nchurches of the national genius.\r\n\r\nWhen in the French towns the word passed from mouth to mouth, on a\r\ntragic day of September, 1914, that Rheims Cathedral was in flames,\r\nthere were many who asked breathlessly: \"And St. Remi? What of St.\r\nRemi?\" And when the invaders burst upon Senlis, many who knew the lovely\r\nspringtime Gothic church of St. Leu d'Esserent trembled for its fate.\r\nOver the birthplace of the nation's unity of language and architecture\r\nhas poured a pitiless rain of iron and fire, a destruction akin to\r\ndesecration.[41] Cradle and necropolis!\r\n\r\nThe iron grip has held cloistral Noyon that was only too content to be\r\nforgotten in its distinguished retirement. The proudest mediæval thing\r\nin France, Laon set with feudal arrogance on its high hill, has been\r\nlong years in chained captivity. For seven centuries the faithful bulls\r\non Laon's towers have looked out, like sentinels, over the city. With\r\ndread forebodings they stood in their captivity, aware that the angel\r\nguard set about Rheims Cathedral had pleaded in vain, that the tower of\r\nSenlis, pride of all the Valois country, had been selected as a target\r\nby the invaders' guns. And Bamburg and Limburg, Halberstadt and\r\nMagdeburg, had copied Laon Cathedral in the old days when the _opus\r\nfrancigenum_ aroused emulation, not hate, across the Rhine.\r\n\r\nMonth after month, year after year, the shells rained on Soissons; town\r\nand cathedral lie in ruins. The fair cities of this inmost heart of\r\nFrance have been desolated, the loyal places that hastened to open their\r\ngates to Jeanne d'Arc when she rode by with her king from the coronation\r\nin Rheims--Senlis and Laon, Soissons and Compiègne,[42] and\r\nCrespy-en-Valois, the countryside that greeted her with such love that\r\nshe said she hoped to be buried among such good folk, among these\r\n_chiers et bons amis les loyaulx Franxois habitons les bonnes\r\nvilles_.[43] Always in the vanguard of battle were these ancient cities\r\nof France, always the boulevard of the capital, yet the wars of\r\ncenturies had respected their churches. Future ages will read of the\r\nglorification of brute force by the invaders who refused to take pity on\r\nSoissons, Noyon, and Rheims, when they stand before the giant amorphous\r\n1913 memorial at Leipzig. Therein speaks the Prussian purpose as\r\ndistinctly as, in Gothic cathedrals, speaks the idealism that sent the\r\nold and young crusading, and spurred man on to \"the bravest effort he\r\never made to save his soul.\"\r\n\r\nTragic irreparable early churches of France! Like martyrs in the arena,\r\nyou have been laid low, one after the other.... But martyrs leave\r\nundying memories. If loved before with an almost unfair preference, you\r\nare sacred now. Rheims, Soissons, Noyon, and Senlis--your names have\r\nbecome sacramental.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOYON CATHEDRAL[44]\r\n\r\n    Vous entendrez rugir une de ces batailles\r\n    Où les peuples entiers se mordent aux entrailles,\r\n    Un combat formidable aux cris désespérés,\r\n    Dont parleront longtemps les hommes effarés;\r\n    Car nous saurons de moins, si notre France expire,\r\n    Lui creuser un tombeau plus large qu'un empire.\r\n    --LOUIS BOUILHET.\r\n\r\nMost of the cathedrals of France have an early history following the\r\nsame general lines. Each may be said to have passed through a\r\nMerovingian stage, and to have rebuilt itself larger and finer in\r\nCarolingian times.[45] The inroads of the Northmen pirates and the\r\nconflagration of timber roofs wrecked most of the cathedrals, so that a\r\nthird and often a fourth reconstruction went on during the Romanesque\r\nera--the century and a half that followed the year 1000. When the\r\nevolution of Gothic art was accomplished, there were few churches that\r\nwere not renewed. It has been said that never before had such a noble\r\nfrenzy of building seized on mankind.\r\n\r\nIn the short biography traced here of each cathedral, seldom will an\r\naccount be given of former edifices, but rather the story of each church\r\nas it now stands. While some portion may be Romanesque, it is uncommon\r\nto find any Carolingian vestige remaining.\r\n\r\nThe bishop of Noyon took the initiative set by Abbot Suger at St. Denis.\r\nHe was the first to start a cathedral in the new way just as Noyon can\r\nboast that hers was the first communal charter of which there is record.\r\nIn 1109 the liberal Bishop Baudry granted the town its franchise,\r\nwithout the turbulent scenes by which other cities were to wrench theirs\r\nfrom their feudal proprietors. \"Know then, all Christians, present and\r\nfuture, that by advice of priests, knights, and townsman I have\r\nestablished a commune in Noyon,\" begins the bishop's parchment. Many a\r\nneighboring city modeled its charter on that of Noyon.\r\n\r\nThe quiet towns on the Oise played a precocious part in what Gratry\r\ncalls \"the big historic effort at justice which occurred in the XII\r\ncentury, the strong will to get out of barbaric chaos which began our\r\nera, and which, eight hundred years ago, started the impulses of modern\r\nprogress.\" From city to city the communal movement quickened. France\r\nbegan to be covered by associations for mutual aid, and the winning of\r\ncity charters and the creation of guilds went hand in hand with the\r\nintellectual ferment in the schools and the creation of a national\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nA second Carolingian cathedral of Noyon was replaced in the XI century\r\nby a Romanesque one which was burned in 1131, when the city was laid in\r\nashes. At that time, Pope Innocent II was visiting a lord of the region,\r\na cousin of Louis VII, and the brother of the bishop of Noyon, Simon de\r\nVermandois. The pope wrote to various French prelates enjoining on them\r\nto help Noyon in its disaster. Bishop Simon must have built part of the\r\nwalls of the present choir, but as he accompanied Louis VII on the\r\nSecond Crusade, and died in the East, it was his successor, Bishop\r\nBaudouin II (1148-67), friend of Suger, friend, too, of St. Bernard, who\r\nreally inaugurated the present cathedral about 1150. He sacrificed in\r\nlarge part what was already done of Bishop Simon's choir in order to put\r\nit into character with the newly expounded principles of architecture.\r\nThe choir of St. Denis was his direct model, and he obtained from Abbot\r\nSuger some of his masons; the profiles and ornamentation at Noyon are\r\nidentical with those of St. Denis.\r\n\r\nIn 1157, the relics of St. Eloi, Noyon's noted VII-century bishop, a\r\nskilled goldsmith and prime minister for King Dagobert, were transferred\r\nto the new sanctuary, probably because it was then completed. In the\r\ntime of Bishop Baudouin III, who died in 1174, the transept was\r\nfinished, as well as the bays of the nave near it. Noyon's western limb\r\nrose during three campaigns of work, as is indicated by differences in\r\nits details, but in main part the nave is a work of the final quarter of\r\nthe XII century.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral was finished by the westernmost bay of its nave, its\r\ncapacious porch, and the southwest tower, under Bishop Étienne de\r\nNemours (1188-1222), who had three brothers, also bishops and builders,\r\nat Paris, at Meaux, and at Châlons, the sons, all four of them, of a\r\nlord chancellor of France. In Noyon, Bishop Étienne was a sound\r\nadministrator; he was favorable to the municipality, regulated the\r\ntown's moneys, and built a hospital. Philippe-Auguste sent him to\r\nDenmark to escort to France the unfortunate Princess Ingeborg, who was\r\nto be his second wife. The bishop was buried as a benefactor in the\r\nabbey of Ourscamp, four miles from Noyon, farther down the Oise, which\r\nhouse was a foundation of Bishop Simon de Vermandois, though only\r\nvestiges of its XII-century parts remain.[46]\r\n\r\nDuring the last decade of the XIII century a terrible fire raged for two\r\ndays in Noyon Cathedral. The vaulting throughout the church, save in the\r\nchoir aisle, had to be reconstructed. For the sexpartite system, which\r\nembraces two bays, and has six branches from the keystone of each vault\r\nsection, was now substituted the barlong plan, where diagonals cover\r\none bay. The early-Gothic architects took up with enthusiasm the\r\nNormans' sexpartite plan, but after using it for half a century they\r\nmost sensibly returned to the quadripartite system as better suited to\r\ntheir needs. The sexpartite vault calls for piers of alternating\r\nstrength, since on the heavier pier fall diagonals and transverse arch,\r\nand only a transverse arch on the intermediate pier.\r\n\r\nNoyon Cathedral had from its start planned for a sexpartite vault by\r\nbuilding its ground supports of alternating strength. Its piers,\r\ntherefore, became illogical when a barlong vaulting was erected after\r\nthe fire of 1193. And one regrets that it has not its original stone\r\nroof, since the correlations in this hardy first cathedral are elsewhere\r\nvery perfect. Throughout the church are details of subtle charm. There\r\nis a slight bending out, like a horseshoe, of the archivolts of the pier\r\narcade, which archivolts are severely plain. Usually from the abacus of\r\na main pier rise five clustered shafts to the level of the\r\nvault-springing, two to catch the diagonals, two for the longitudinal or\r\nwall arches, and one for the transverse arch. Noyon showed constructive\r\nagility in concentrating its wall ribs and diagonals on a single shaft,\r\nwhich meant only three clustered colonnettes from main piers to\r\nvault-springing.\r\n\r\nEach cathedral in France possesses a few traits peculiar to itself.\r\nNoyon is unique in having both ends of its transept terminate in\r\nhemicycles, like a Rhenish church.[47] The Romanesque school of the\r\nRhine had derived the feature from the early chapels of Rome. Probably\r\nNoyon's transept apses came from retaining the foundations of the\r\nprevious cathedral. A church which was long in the jurisdiction of\r\nNoyon--the cathedral at Tournai--still possesses its Romanesque transept\r\nwith semicircular ends. Cambrai Cathedral, destroyed by the Revolution,\r\nonce had a similar pre-Gothic transept; its choir, built from 1220 to\r\n1237 in the golden day of the national art, was an irreparable loss.\r\nNoyon Cathedral showed another Germanic trait in what may be called a\r\nwestern transept, made by the lower stories of the façade towers and the\r\nmiddle section of the first bay.\r\n\r\nThe nave of Noyon is a noble vessel, with an interior four-story\r\nelevation of happier proportions than was achieved in the transept. No\r\nlonger do annulets bind the clustered shafts, thus breaking the\r\nascending line as in the choir. Throughout the church is to be found the\r\nsimultaneous use of round and pointed arches, and, curiously enough, it\r\nis the lower stories, pier arcade, and tribune, that used the pointed\r\narch; in the triforium and clearstory the arches are semicircular.\r\nEverywhere the sculptured capitals are of rare beauty. The Romanesque\r\nacanthus leaf is found in juxtaposition with the Gothic crocket.\r\n\r\nNoyon is exceptional in having retained its annexes: the treasure hall\r\nbuilt by Bishop Baudouin II, the chapel of the episcopal palace, a\r\nhalf-timber library, and a beautiful chapter house (c. 1240). This\r\nlatter, opening on a fragment of the cathedral cloister, is a hall\r\ndivided into two aisles by a row of slender pillars, the type preferred\r\nby the French, whereas in England the circular hall whose vault ribs\r\nwere gathered on a central pier was more popular. Noyon's chapter house\r\nwas built by Bishop Pierre Chalot, who died at sea, off Cyprus, on St.\r\nLouis' crusade of 1248.\r\n\r\nWhen in late-Gothic times Noyon was adding chapels and side aisles, her\r\nmaster-of-works was Jean Turpin, who at Péronne--pitiful Péronne la\r\nPucelle entirely a ruin to-day--erected a Flamboyant Gothic church which\r\nwas a veritable gem.\r\n\r\nThe battle of giants, foreseen in the poet's dream, twice engulfed Noyon\r\nduring the World War. From the first occupation by the enemy the city\r\nescaped without serious injury. Then in March, 1918, began the Germans'\r\ndesperate advance on Paris. At the end of the month the mayor of Noyon\r\nquitted the city, the last to leave. And in September he was the first\r\nto re-enter Noyon after the second battle of the Marne had driven back\r\nthe invaders. He found his town a ruin. Not a single building had\r\nescaped injury, and only ten days earlier a photograph taken from a\r\nFrench airship had shown that the Renaissance Town Hall and Noyon's\r\nchief square were intact; few monuments had suffered from the occasional\r\nbombardments by the Allies. The Hôtel de Ville had been built in the\r\ndawn of the classic Renaissance, and its fine façades retained much of\r\nthe Gothic spirit. Before their departure the invaders blew up the town;\r\nnot even Calvin's birthplace was spared. Hardly 10 per cent of the\r\nhouses of this amiable little city that asked only to be left unmolested\r\nby the fever and fret of new things are to-day worth reconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Noyon's Chapter House (1240-1250)_]\r\n\r\nAs if by a miracle, the cathedral and a side street named for the old\r\ngoldsmith bishop, St. Eloi, were preserved. The cathedral roof is\r\npierced by shells in a dozen places and the northern tower and the porch\r\nbetween the towers are smashed, but the interior is but slightly\r\ndamaged. In one of the side chapels a vandal fired his pistol many times\r\nat a picture of the Saviour. Perhaps it was the memory that Noyon's\r\nrounded transept ends and forechurch were Germanic which saved the\r\ncathedral. Better is it to remember by a Radegund, by a Charlemagne,\r\nthan by Odin and Thor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF SENLIS[48]\r\n\r\n     To-day analysis has seized on all things, and it is leading us to\r\n     death. Man, we must not forget, lives intellectually by\r\n     synthesis.... If archæology is to make known the monuments of the\r\n     past, it ought, before all else, to try to make them loved, for,\r\n     given the uncertitude of the future, it is in that love that they\r\n     will find their only chance of safety.\r\n\r\n     --ÉMILE LAMBIN.[49]\r\n\r\nSenlis was the second begun of the Gothic cathedrals. The most fecund\r\nregion for early essays in the nascent national art lay between Senlis\r\nand Noyon. Thibaut, bishop of Senlis, was present at Abbot Suger's\r\ndeathbed in 1151. Filled with the ambition to replace his half-ruined\r\nchurch by a Gothic one, he began, about 1152, the new works, and once\r\nmore the abbey church of St. Denis was the model. Some of Senlis'\r\noriginal vaults remain over side aisles, tribune, and apse chapels.\r\nTheir intersecting ribs show a certain inexperience, and in places\r\nsemicircular diagonals still are used. The framing arches of each\r\nsection are lower than the keystone of the diagonals, which imparts a\r\n_bombé_ shape to the vault. As the masons acquired skill in the making\r\nof Gothic stone roofs, this domical form died out; by stilting, by\r\ndepressing, and by pointing the arches was the difficulty solved. Like\r\nNoyon, Senlis played a part in the early history of France. The\r\nMerovingian and Carolingian kings and those of the House of Capet\r\nfrequented the little city in order to hunt in the forests of the Oise.\r\nLouis VII made Senlis his favorite residence, and when the new\r\ncathedral was undertaken he allowed donations to be collected over the\r\nentire kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Thibaut died, the succeeding prelates, Henri and Geoffrey,\r\ncontinued to give largely of their revenues to the new works, but the\r\nprogress was slow. Senlis was a small diocese for so big a monument.\r\nAbout the time that the choir was finished, 1180, the sculpture of the\r\ncentral-western portal was set up, a gem of Primary Gothic, though sadly\r\ndamaged by time. It marks a date in French mediæval sculpture. On the\r\nlintel is related the Death of the Virgin and her Assumption, in the\r\ntympanum her Coronation. Senlis was the first to use this ordinance\r\nwhich the XIII century frequently repeated; we find it at Chartres'\r\nnorth portal, and at the entrance under the northwest tower of Notre\r\nDame at Paris.\r\n\r\nM. Émile Mâle with his usual happy phrasing speaks of the lyric beauty\r\nof the lintel stone at Senlis.[50] It was partly inspired by the _Golden\r\nLegend_ of the good Bishop James of Genoa, which in its turn had used\r\nthe apocryphal gospels freely.[51] The legend relates that at the\r\ndeathbed of Our Lady, the Apostles gathered, and St. John cautioned\r\nthem: \"Be careful when she is dead that no one weeps, lest the people,\r\nseeing our tears, be troubled, and say, 'They fear death, who preach the\r\nResurrection.'\" For three days Our Lady rested in her tomb in the valley\r\nof Jehoshaphat, then came her Divine Son, with angels, singing the\r\nCanticle of Canticles, to escort her to Paradise. The old sculptor of\r\nSenlis has depicted the touching reverence with which the angels bend,\r\nto lift from the tomb their future Queen of Heaven. Their gesture of\r\neager love is one of the exquisitely delicate conceptions of mediæval\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nWhile they were carving the west portal there came to Senlis a touching\r\nfigure, the young mother of the future Louis VIII, Isabelle, daughter of\r\nBaudouin V of Flanders, who claimed direct descent from Charlemagne;\r\nthrough her the blood of the Carolingian line passed into the third\r\ndynasty of France. She was to die, at nineteen, almost repudiated by\r\nPhilippe-Auguste, because her people declined to support one of his\r\nprojects. In Senlis Cathedral this gentle grandmother of St. Louis\r\nwalked barefooted, candle in hand, beseeching assistance from the Mother\r\nof God with such humility that the beholders wept. She founded a chapel\r\nin the cathedral.\r\n\r\nA few years later, in 1191, the cathedral of Senlis was consecrated by\r\nthat archbishop of Sens who was Philippe-Auguste's uncle, Guillaume of\r\nChampagne, William of the White Hands, the prelate who had completed the\r\ncathedral at Sens. And there came to the dedication Bishop Nivelon de\r\nChérisy, just starting Soissons' Cathedral; Bishop Étienne de Nemours,\r\nat work on Noyon's; the prelate of Meaux, who was raising that\r\ncathedral; and many another expert in the new art. Sometime later,\r\nBishop Geoffrey resigned his see, and in his place was elected Pierre\r\nGuérin, chancellor of France under three kings, a figure worthy to stand\r\nbeside those Gallo-Roman bishops who remained as bulwarks of society\r\nwhen the Roman Empire fell in pieces around them.\r\n\r\nBishop Guérin was a man possessed by a passion for the public weal. His\r\nprudence and firmness caused Philippe-Auguste and Louis VIII to name him\r\nexecutor of their testaments. One of his enterprises was the organizing\r\nof the royal archives. It was he who came to Blanche of Castile to break\r\nthe news of her husband's death as she rode out from Paris to meet Louis\r\nVIII returning from the southern war. For Louis IX during his minority\r\nhe showed a father's affection. \"He governed marvelously well the\r\nkingdom's needs,\" says the old chronicler, and when he died, on his\r\ngrave they inscribed, \"Here lies Guérin, whose life was an untiring\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nIn early life Guérin had, in Palestine, become a Knight Hospitalier of\r\nSt. John of Jerusalem, and, as bishop, continued to wear the white habit\r\nof that military order. At the battle of Bouvines, though not an actual\r\ncombatant, he exhorted the troops and directed maneuvers, for he was\r\nskilled in the strategy of war. A survey of the enemy's position made\r\nhim urge Philippe-Auguste to attack at once, and the king, who knew\r\nGuérin to be _sages homs et de parfont conseil_, obeyed, thus winning\r\nthe greatest victory of the century. \"On that day French unity received\r\nits baptism.\"\r\n\r\nThe king had vowed, were his arms successful, to endow an abbey. Bishop\r\nGuérin laid for him the first stone of the Abbaye de la Victoire, near\r\nhis episcopal city.[52] Before this greatest of the bishops of Senlis\r\ndied, his cathedral had begun to crown its southwest tower by the\r\noctagon and spire which are the boast of all the Valois country. St.\r\nLouis must have contributed to Senlis' famous tower, which places in\r\nforemost rank, this, the smallest cathedral in France. The unknown\r\narchitect gathered features from many a beacon to unite them here in a\r\nmasterpiece. He may be said to have created a new type, since his belfry\r\nat Senlis made a school in the region.[53]\r\n\r\nThe graduation of the upright shaft into the inclined plane, which in\r\nevery tower is the crucial point, has here been accomplished with such\r\naddress, such rhythm, that precisely at what instant the fusion takes\r\nplace is not to be determined. It has been said that the shaft of the\r\ntower is too high in proportion to its spire; at a distance perhaps the\r\ncriticism may seem justified, but not on closer view. Some have thought\r\nthat Senlis' belfry was a trifle too conscious of its charms, that it\r\nhad not the calm poise of Chartres' tower. So it may be; there is more\r\nof the woman than the archangel in it. Its personal graciousness has\r\nbecome so wedded with the lives of Senlis' townspeople that they wish it\r\ngood morning as they pass. The voyager will not find himself many hours\r\nin Senlis without pausing at every coign of vantage to gain some new\r\nsilhouette effect of the slender beacon. It is charming when viewed in\r\nthe same group as the Gallo-Roman ramparts. And from the open door of\r\nthe church of St. Frambourg,[54] it can be studied at leisure.\r\n\r\nIn the original plan of Senlis' Cathedral there was only an indication\r\nof a transept--two small lateral chapels that open, to-day, from the\r\nchoir aisle. When, about 1240, the radiant tower was finished they\r\nundertook to make a real transept. To insert one they had to do away\r\nwith four bays of the nave; some ancient columns in the west piers of\r\nthe transept witness to this change. In its present form the transept of\r\nSenlis belongs to the XIII century only in its lower walls.\r\n\r\nIn 1504 a conflagration lasting several days destroyed the cathedral's\r\nupper vaulting and necessitated the total reconstruction of the\r\nclearstory. In consequence, the exterior appearance of this very early\r\nGothic church is most decidedly Flamboyant. Only the apse and the west\r\nfaçade have retained their Primary Gothic aspect. Chapels with\r\ncomplicated pendant vaults were built, aisles were added, and\r\nbalustrades put before the tribune opening. Thick coats of whitewash\r\ncoarsened the lines; in fact, restorations have been so radical, and\r\nmany of them so over-ornate, that this cathedral has been called the\r\nGothic of bad taste. An extreme criticism, for if some of the changes\r\nare distressing, Senlis' transept façades, which also are later\r\nadditions, are to be reckoned among the best work of the final phase of\r\nthe national art.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire of 1504 the cathedral chapter sought assistance from the\r\nking: \"_Plaise au Roy d'avoir pitié et compassion de la paoure église de\r\nSenlis ... laquelle, par fortune et inconvénient de feu a été bruslée,\r\nles cloches fondues, et le clocher qui est grant, magnifique et l'un des\r\nsinguliers du royaume, au moyen du dit feu tellement endommagé qu'il est\r\nen danger de tomber_.\" Royalty responded generously as the sculpture\r\nshows; at the transept's portals are to be seen the porcupine of Louis\r\nXII, the ermine of Anne of Brittany, and the salamander of Francis I.\r\n\r\nUnder the learned Bishop Guillaume Parvi, confessor to Francis I, was\r\nlaid the first stone of the transept's elaborate south façade in 1521.\r\nOn it worked Pierre de Chambiges, son of the noted maker of late-Gothic\r\nfrontispieces, and Jean Dixieult. And when it was nearing completion in\r\n1560 the north façade was begun, and finished by the latter master.\r\n\r\nEffective, vivid, alertly handsome are Senlis' transept fronts. The wise\r\ntraveler, even if he infinitely prefers the purer lines of early Gothic,\r\nwill learn to value this florid final expansion of the national art. The\r\nrenewal of builders' energy in the XV and XVI centuries was a sumptuous\r\nphase worthy of admiration. Those who are partial to English Gothic do\r\nnot need to be warned against depreciating French Flamboyant work. The\r\nadvice to be eclectic in travel, so as not to lose any source of\r\nartistic pleasure, is for those whose ideal of the builders' art is that\r\nof the Ile-de-France, comprised between 1150 and 1250. For such the\r\nchief interest of Senlis will be the cathedral's apse, its main façade,\r\nand the splendid tower. Let them widen their sympathies and take in the\r\neffective transept-fronts of the Flamboyant rebirth.\r\n\r\nSenlis of the towers, of the silent squares, of the quaint names--rue\r\ndes Fromages, rue du Puits-Tiphane, rue des Pigeons Blancs--a charming\r\naristocratic little city, set in an undulating Corot-like landscape,\r\ndotted with country houses, was the very epitome of well-conditioned\r\nprovincial life. Before the summer of 1914 no spot on earth seemed\r\nfarther removed from violence and crime. Then came the invading hordes\r\nover the Valois land. On September 2, 1914, the Germans surrounded\r\nSenlis, which, _ville ouverte_ though it was, they proceeded to bombard.\r\nOne third of the obus that fell hit the cathedral. That the guns, three\r\nmiles away, were pointed on the famous tower would seem to be proved by\r\nthe fact that only those houses were damaged which lay in the direct\r\nline between the German battery and Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nWhen the enemy entered the city the mayor (shot later in reprisal) met\r\nthem at the Hôtel de Ville. He had scarcely assured them that no troops\r\nremained in Senlis when shots rang out: by ill luck some colonial\r\ncolored troops, on retiring, fired a salute. Thereupon followed the\r\nusual accusation that civilians were the combatants, and the usual\r\ntragic scenes of reprisal. Down the main street of the little city\r\npassed the trained wreckers of peaceful homes, prying open the doors to\r\nthrow in incendiary bombs. Before night a whole section of Senlis lay an\r\nunsightly blackened ruin.... Then came the victory of the Marne and the\r\ninvaders retreated. The havoc done to the cathedral can be repaired,\r\nthough, in the process, must be lost the exquisite golden lichen stain\r\nwhich long ages had achieved. The preservation of Senlis' tower was due\r\nto a curé of the cathedral who fearlessly pleaded for his church before\r\nthe German commandant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF SENS[55]\r\n\r\n     What were Rheims and Soissons before their martyrdom but the\r\n     transfiguring of stone and metal and wood; dead matter delved from\r\n     the ground or hewn out of the forest, through the labor of man\r\n     exalted into forms of absolute beauty, and, because of this\r\n     loving labor, transformed ... into a mysterious creation that, in\r\n     the words of Suger of St. Denis, was neither wholly of earth nor\r\n     wholly of Heaven, but a mysterious blending of both.\r\n\r\n    --RALPH ADAMS CRAM.[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Senlis' Tower (c. 1230-1250)_]\r\n\r\nSens was a chief Celtic city at the intersecting of the Roman roads from\r\nLyons to Paris, from Orléans to Troyes. Long did it dispute the title of\r\nprimate of Gaul with Lyons and Rheims; even down to the XVI century\r\nParis was within its jurisdiction. To-day as the express trains rush by\r\nfrom Paris to Marseilles, many a traveler looks out on a cathedral that\r\nseems to over-tower and overpower a flat, sleepy little town whose name\r\nhe scarcely knows. When the cathedral was building in the XII century\r\nSens was a center of the nation's life, and under a succession of\r\nnoteworthy archbishops reached its zenith.\r\n\r\nHere at the Council of Sens, in 1140, was scheduled to take place a\r\nfinal contest between St. Bernard and Abélard, and in that hour of\r\nenthusiasm over abstract controversy, the king with his court and people\r\nof every degree flocked to Sens for the schoolmen's debate on the\r\nTrinity. At the last moment Abélard, the inexhaustible arguer who had\r\nhimself called for the test, quitted the combat. Some twenty years later\r\nPope Alexander III spent a year and a half in Sens, and hither came\r\nThomas Becket to seek papal indorsement for his opposition to Henry II's\r\ninterference in church affairs. Between these two events, 1140 to 1164,\r\nlies the building of Sens Cathedral. At the time of Abélard's and St.\r\nBernard's visit the present edifice had been started. During the\r\nresidence here of Alexander III and the archbishop of Canterbury it was\r\nnearing completion. The pope is recorded as dedicating an altar.\r\n\r\nFor a time Sens usurped the claim to be the oldest of the Gothic\r\ncathedrals. Its choir was started as Romanesque, but the walls rose\r\nslowly, and before a stone roof crowned the ambulatory the new system of\r\nbuilding had conquered public opinion. The choir-aisle walls, intended\r\nto carry a groin vault, were rearranged to bear one with diagonals. On\r\nthe outer wall the diagonals were caught on corbels placed above the\r\ncapitals, and though such an arrangement shows maladroitness, the ribs\r\nthemselves were made by no novice hand. Sens was a pioneer in the use of\r\nthe broken rib to avoid the curving of diagonals: from each keystone,\r\nset precisely in the center of each section, branched the four ribs.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the procession path and an apsidal chapel opening on the\r\ntransept's north arm, are the oldest parts of Sens Cathedral. It is true\r\nthat they antedate the dedication of St. Denis, but not by a few\r\nRomanesque vestiges can Sens substantiate its claim to be the first\r\nbuilt of Gothic cathedrals. In its main parts it belongs to the third\r\nquarter of the XII century. It was a distinct advance on Noyon and\r\nSenlis, because it eliminated the deep tribunes over the side aisles.\r\nOne of the striking characteristics of Sens is the way that light floods\r\nit from the aisle windows, which are on a noble scale. Because the\r\nchurch was built during a tentative hour its deficiency lies in the\r\nheight of the central nave. For right proportion, when flanked by such\r\nlofty aisles, the nave should have been made considerably higher.\r\n\r\nSens Cathedral was begun by Archbishop Henri-le-Sanglier (1122-43) to\r\nreplace a church dedicated at the end of the X century. Such strides has\r\nmediæval archaeology taken in France during the last generations, it is\r\nhard to believe that serious students, during the Congrès Archéologique\r\nheld at Sens in 1840, could have considered the present edifice to be\r\nthe one dedicated before 1000.\r\n\r\nHenri-le-Sanglier had been appointed by Louis VI to the see of Sens\r\nbefore he had received holy orders, and in the lax spiritual standards\r\nof the day, he saw no harm in living like the feudal lord he was by\r\nbirth. He had not Thomas of Canterbury's unbending consistency. When his\r\nworldliness was censured by St. Bernard he changed his way of life, and\r\nultimately proved himself a loyal and humane pastor.\r\n\r\nOf the six archbishops who were to follow him as builders of Sens'\r\nmetropolitan church, all of them were national figures. Under the long\r\nrule of Hugues de Toucy (1143-68) the church was mainly erected. He was\r\nthe friend of Abbot Suger the pioneer, the friend, too, of Bernard the\r\nregenerator, who came as his guest to Sens, after preaching the Second\r\nCrusade at Vézelay. The same hospitable bishop welcomed on two occasions\r\nthe exiled archbishop of Canterbury. The second visit of St. Thomas\r\nBecket was when he had been forced to quit the abbey of Pontigny,\r\nsituated close by over the Burgundian border, because Henry Plantagenet\r\nswore to close every Cistercian house in his English and French domains\r\nif further refuge were offered the prelate. Moved by the welcome given\r\nhim in his distress by the archbishop of Sens, the famous Englishman\r\ncried out--so his secretary, Herbert of Bosham, records: \"Ah, we have\r\nproved the truth of the old saying--'_douce France! ô douce encore, ô\r\ntrès douce France! Oui, elle est douce, vraiment douce, la France!_'\"\r\n\r\nBy a series of logical inferences the name of the architect of this\r\nPrimary Gothic cathedral has been added to the roll call of honor. It is\r\nknown that Guillaume de Sens, a French master, was chosen in 1174 by the\r\nchapter of Canterbury to rebuild their cathedral, destroyed by fire. He\r\ndrew the plan of Canterbury and had put up its apse, its Lady chapel,\r\nand two bays of the choir, when one day he fell fifty feet from a\r\nscaffold, and returned, in 1180, to his native land to die. An English\r\narchitect, also named William, continued the works at Canterbury, always\r\non the plan of French William.\r\n\r\nNow the chevet of Canterbury has strong analogies with that of Sens.\r\nThere is the same single chapel in its axis; at Sens other apse chapels\r\nwere added in the XVI and XVIII centuries. The profiles were alike in\r\nboth cathedrals, and so were the sexpartite vaulting and the embryo\r\ntransept. In both Canterbury and Sens is an exceptional feature, of\r\nChampagne origin, which could hardly have been used accidentally by two\r\nmen in the same generation. Each alternate pier, at Sens, consists of\r\ntwin columns, placed side by side according to the width, not the\r\nlength, of the church. At Canterbury, despite subsequent rebuildings,\r\nthe same arrangement is still to be found in the bay before the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\nGuillaume de Sens was too prominent to have copied another man's work,\r\nand since it is certain that the plan of Canterbury is his, it is now\r\naccepted that he built the cathedral of his native town before he\r\nproceeded to England. The homogeneous choir and nave of Sens show that\r\nthey are the work of the years preceding 1175. And Guillaume's claim to\r\nbe Sens' architect is further strengthened by a historic link. Not only\r\ndid Thomas Becket spend three weeks with Archbishop Hugues de Toucy on\r\nhis first arrival in the city during the pope's stay there, but, after\r\nquitting Pontigny, he passed some years in St. Colombe monastery by the\r\ntown. Without a doubt he knew the master-of-works who was erecting the\r\ncathedral, and it may have been he who, on his return to his own see,\r\nmade the French architect's skill known to his cathedral chapter.\r\nGuillaume was not called to Canterbury, however, till after the\r\nmartyrdom of its great archbishop.\r\n\r\nSens Cathedral was completed by a prince of the reigning house of\r\nChampagne, a son of Thibaut the Great, Archbishop\r\nGuillaume-of-the-White-Hands (1168-76). He, too, was Becket's stanch\r\nsupporter, and denounced his murder to the pope, though by blood he was\r\nHenry II's cousin. In 1178 he crossed to England to pray by the tomb of\r\nthe newly canonized saint--one of the first of the Canterbury Pilgrims\r\nwho for over three hundred years were to wend their way to the shrine in\r\nKent. Through his influence, Becket's friend and adviser, John of\r\nSalisbury, the ablest scholar of his generation, was raised to the see\r\nof Chartres. Both William of Champagne and John of Salisbury received\r\nepiscopal consecration from the hands of good Maurice de Sully, the\r\nbuilder of Paris Cathedral. In his later life Archbishop Guillaume was\r\ntransferred to the see of Rheims, and in that cathedral he anointed as\r\nking his own nephew, Philippe-Auguste, whose prime minister he was; when\r\nPhilippe II went on the Third Crusade he left as regents his uncle and\r\nhis mother, Alix of Champagne. The archbishop's affection for his nephew\r\nled him to sanction the king's divorce from Ingeborg of Denmark and his\r\nmarriage to Agnes of Méran, which drew on France the papal interdict,\r\nand on William of Champagne the censures of Innocent III.\r\n\r\nThe house occupied by Thomas Becket, in the cloister of Sens Cathedral,\r\nwas decorated by a statue of him, which disappeared during the\r\nRevolution. During excavations in the cloister, in 1899, they came upon\r\nan image representing a bishop, and marked with the seal of Archbishop\r\nGuillaume-of-the-White-Hands. The statue is now set up in the choir\r\naisle on the site where once stood an altar dedicated to St. Thomas of\r\nCanterbury.\r\n\r\nThe tutelary of Sens Cathedral is St. Stephen, the first martyr. A\r\nXII-century statue at the trumeau, or central shaft, of the west door\r\npresents him as the beautiful youthful servant of the Lord. Gazing at it\r\none thinks of St. Augustine's words: \"The Church would never have had\r\nSt. Paul but for St. Stephen's prayer.\" Paul, holding the robes of those\r\nwho stoned Stephen, heard the martyr pray for his executioners. The\r\ntrumeau statue of St. Etienne with its parallel feet marks the\r\ntransition from the column image, such as those at Chartres' western\r\nportal, to the XIII-century type of saintly personages at the doors of\r\nRheims and Amiens. It escaped mutilation during the Revolution because\r\nsome one had the wit to write on the stone tablet in the saint's hand,\r\n_The Book of the Law_. The foliage relief on the shaft is exquisite.\r\n\r\nAs the XII century closed the archbishop of Sens was Michel de Corbeil\r\n(1194-99), a well-known scholastic writer. Under him and Pierre de\r\nCorbeil (d. 1222), his successor and also a learned teacher from the\r\nParis schools, the axis chapel at Sens was rebuilt, and the upper\r\nvaulting of choir and nave reconstructed in order to enlarge the\r\nwindows. As the longitudinal or wall arches were now raised to the level\r\nof the keystone, the bombé shape of the vault disappeared; in the chevet\r\nthe wall ribs show as many as three sets of capitals. The vault sections\r\nof the side aisles, however, remained domical, as originally built.\r\n\r\nTwo other distinguished brothers, men of great lineage and intellectual\r\nattainment, ruled the see of Sens during many years, Gautier de Cornut\r\nfrom 1222 to 1241 and Gilles de Cornut, who died in 1254; and they had a\r\nbrother who busied himself with the new cathedral at Beauvais. Gautier\r\nde Cornut, who while doctor of law in Paris University served as\r\nchaplain to Philippe-Auguste and Louis VIII, was the envoy sent in 1234\r\nto fetch Marguerite of Provence to be married to Louis IX in Sens\r\nCathedral, the king then being in his twentieth year. The young princess\r\nof the art-loving Midi came north accompanied by a troop of minstrels.\r\nAgain in 1239 St. Louis returned to Sens for the Crown of Thorns, on its\r\ntransit from Venice to Paris, and he walked out some miles from the city\r\nto meet it. Barefooted, he and his brother, Robert of Artois, bore back\r\nthe previous relics to the cathedral, through streets hung with\r\ntapestries and lighted by candles. The relic rested in St. Étienne's\r\nchurch all night and then in a solemn, eight-day procession was carried\r\nto Paris. The king had the archbishop write the formal account of it\r\nall. Gautier de Cornut erected the synodal hall which touches the\r\ncathedral's façade, and his own statue and that of the young king\r\ndecorated its buttresses. The best civic monument of St. Louis' reign\r\nmany think it to be, and as perfect in its own way as the hospital hall\r\nat Ourscamp, its contemporary.\r\n\r\nIn 1267 the cathedral's southwest tower fell; it may have been one built\r\nin Carolingian times from the proceeds of a gold retable, or it may have\r\nbeen a XII-century tower of Archbishop Hugues de Toucy's time, as are\r\nthe two lower stories of the present northwest tower. Its fall\r\nnecessitated the remaking of the last two bays of the nave and of the\r\ndamaged western doors during the early XIV century. The side chapels\r\nwere built then, too, but they have been rehandled in the present day,\r\nand are now dissimulated behind an arcaded wall. A record of 1319 speaks\r\nof the able Nicholas de Chaumes as architect here before he proceeded to\r\nMeaux Cathedral. He demolished the ancient chapel on the transept's\r\nsouthern arm, but its corresponding chapel, on the transept's northern\r\narm, still exists and is, with the ambulatory walls, the oldest part of\r\nthe church. Not till after the Hundred Years' War, however, was the plan\r\nto erect a new transept carried through.\r\n\r\nSens then possessed as its archbishop, during forty years, the energetic\r\nTristan de Salazar (d. 1519) who had fought, sword in hand, with Louis\r\nXII in the Italian wars. Like Bishop Jacques d'Amboise, who was then\r\nfinishing at Paris the present Musée Cluny as town house for his abbey\r\nof Cluny, Archbishop de Salazar built the Hôtel Sens in Paris for his\r\ndiocesan house. To his own cathedral he added the southwest tower's\r\nupper story (to which later a Renaissance lantern was attached) and he\r\nconnected the synodal hall with the episcopal palace by a rich gallery.\r\nSome sculptured panels now attached to a pier in the nave of Sens\r\nCathedral originally formed part of a tomb he had made for his parents.\r\nIt was this munificent art patron who began the late-Gothic transept. In\r\n1490 the most notable architect of the day, Martin Chambiges, was\r\ninvited to direct the work, and for four years he gave it his personal\r\nsupervision until called to Troyes to make the Flamboyant Gothic façade\r\nof that cathedral.\r\n\r\nSens Cathedral contains some ancient windows, four of which are among\r\nthe best in France and allied with Suger's school, though probably\r\nexecuted as the XIII century opened, since the saddle bars follow the\r\noutline of the medallion pictures. Those four exceptional windows of the\r\nchoir aisle sparkle with the jeweled intensity of the golden age of the\r\nvitrine art. In one of them is told the story of St. Eustace, often to\r\nbe met with in French iconography, since he figured in the _Golden\r\nLegend_. Another describes the return to England of Thomas Becket and\r\nhis immediate martyrdom. Originally next to it hung a companion lancet,\r\ngiving Becket's early life, but this was done away with to make room for\r\na chapel. The other two lancets are of the _Biblia Pauperum_ type. In\r\none, the parable of the Prodigal Son is given. In the other is the story\r\nof the Good Samaritan, and the half medallions on either side of each\r\ncentral scene interpret it symbolically. Such correlation of the Old\r\nand the New Testament was most popular in the Middle Ages. Beside a\r\nmedallion which shows the traveler fallen among thieves stands the\r\nexpulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden; and the scene of the\r\ncharitable Samaritan is accompanied by pictures of the Saviour's death\r\nand resurrection. They might not be able to write and read, the ordinary\r\nmen and women of that day, they had no daily journal to crowd their\r\nminds with half-digested facts, but their souls were fed by sound\r\nethical truths set forth clearly in their one great book, the cathedral.\r\nThe artisan donors of such windows we may be sure knew the symbolic\r\nmeaning of every panel.\r\n\r\nIn the clearstory windows at the curve of Sens' choir is more\r\nXIII-century glass, but it is later work, lacking the marvelous glow of\r\nthe choir-aisle lancets. The two big roses of the transept are splendid.\r\nA celestial concert was then a favorite theme. The south rose (1500) was\r\nmade by the same Champagne artists, Lyénin, Varin, Verrat, and Godon who\r\nfilled the nave of Troyes Cathedral with its high-colored translucent\r\nwoodcuts. The north rose of the transept finished in 1504, was the work\r\nof native masters, influenced by the noted school of Troyes. The side\r\nwindows in Sens' Flamboyant transept are equally good.[57]\r\n\r\nJean Cousin, born in Sens, 1501, made two of the cathedral's windows,\r\nthe rich one of St. Eutropius, in the nave, and the Tiburtine sibyl of\r\namplest design, in the shrine to the south of the axis chapel. Nothing\r\ncould be more resplendent as picture windows, but Gothic-Renaissance\r\nwork, whose tendency was to treat each light as an isolated picture, is\r\nnot equal to the close-woven patterns of XII-and XIII-century mosaic\r\nglass, which kept itself in subordination to its architectural setting.\r\nThe immense superiority of the earlier windows is demonstrated in Sens\r\nCathedral, which offers us both types at their best.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Interior of Laon Cathedral (XII Century). View from\r\nthe Tribune Gallery_]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF LAON[58]\r\n\r\n     And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of\r\n     heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her\r\n     husband.--Apoc. xxi:2, used in the office for the dedication of a\r\n     church.\r\n\r\nWhile Sens, Noyon, and Senlis were building, the splendid cathedral of\r\nLaon was begun, about 1160. The usual transition features of Primary\r\nGothic showed in its retention of tribunes over the side aisles, in the\r\nsimultaneous use of round and pointed arches, the beringed colonnettes,\r\nand the salient transept arms. The chapel, in two stories, that opened\r\non each arm of the transept, was another Romanesque tradition.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Laon, \"the cathedral of Purity, Silence, and Power,\" is\r\nindeed most impressive. One bay follows another with a regularity that\r\nis accentuated by the interior elevation being in four stories--pier\r\narcade, tribune arches, triforium wall arcade, and clearstory. It is not\r\na lofty church, but, like English cathedrals, what it lacks in height is\r\ncompensated for in length. There are eleven bays in the nave, and ten in\r\nthe choir. Moreover, because it was comparatively low it could build a\r\nsquare transept-crossing tower, and the average French cathedral was too\r\nhigh for such a tower to be artistic. Laon and Braine were exceptions\r\namong Ile-de-France churches in having central lanterns; they were\r\nderived from Normandy, since the Rhenish lantern usually was octagonal.\r\nStrange as it may seem to say of the most prominent, most open, and\r\nbest-lighted part of a church, there is a blessed seclusion beneath the\r\nwide white tower of Laon that \"shuts the heart up in tranquillity.\"\r\n\r\nDown the long church, the stout monolithic piers make two virile lines.\r\nOnly during a short period were such sturdy cylinders used, here and in\r\nNotre Dame at Paris are the chief examples, and both cathedrals were\r\nartistically right in preferring their uniform columns, even though both\r\nof them used the sexpartite vaulting that called for alternating ground\r\nsupports. The coming cathedrals were to adopt once for all the barlong\r\nsystem of vaulting, where the concentration of loads fell equally on\r\nevery bay, and to evolve a classic type of pier, consisting of a central\r\ncylinder flanked by four semi-attached columns. At Laon a few piers in\r\nthe nave experimented with free-standing colonnettes, three of which\r\nwere placed in front of the pillar to enlarge, there, the abacus of the\r\ncapital on which stood the shafts that mounted to the vault-springing.\r\nThe elliptical piers of Beauvais, longer from north to south, were to be\r\nthe most perfect solution of the problem of ground supports.\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that Laon's interior is to-day too white, but we\r\nmust remember that originally color was used on the stones, so that any\r\neffect of a hall would have been impossible in the olden times.\r\nViollet-le-Duc called Laon the laic cathedral _par excellence_. He\r\nconsidered it a great civic hall wherein the populace \"could unite and\r\nenjoy spectacles more or less profane.\" And even in the flat eastern\r\nwall he found something occultly heretical. The towers, he said, were\r\nmore those of a château than a church. He shut his mind to the fact that\r\nLaon was erected largely by its bishops, that it was begun by the choir\r\nend, which is suitable only for divine service, and that if its seven\r\ntowers had been crowned with the sky-pointing spires of the architect's\r\nplan, and if its sky-dreaming windows were still intact, there would be\r\nlittle of the aspect of a town hall about this stately church. Critics\r\nlike Huysmans have exaggerated its present iciness: no one can pray in\r\nLaon, he exclaimed; its soul is fled forever. But what would be\r\nChartres, his spot of election for prayer, were it unsoftened by its\r\n\"storied windows richly dight\"?\r\n\r\nOnly a slight amount of ancient glass has survived in Laon. The north\r\nrose of the transept shows pictures of the sciences. Beneath the rose\r\nwindow in the flat eastern wall are three handsome lancets made by the\r\nschool of Chartres early in the XIII century. They show the passing away\r\nof the hieratic Byzantine gesture: in the Annunciation and Visitation\r\nmedallions the robes float naturally; in the Nativity scene the natural\r\ngesture of a woman who tests the warmth of the water before bathing the\r\nHoly Child has been well rendered.\r\n\r\nIf a lack of accessories makes the interior of Laon Cathedral seem\r\nto-day more philosophic than religious, there are certain lovable\r\nindividual touches in it that warm both heart and imagination. In the\r\nfirst place it is a church fairly garlanded with springtime foliage. The\r\nwonder of eternal youth is in its half-curled leaves which the sculptors\r\nconventionalized just enough to make them architectural. Not one sprig,\r\nnot one leaf is like another. Never was nature more profoundly loved or\r\nmore convincingly interpreted.\r\n\r\nThen there are the stone bulls of Laon. They stand high on the western\r\ntowers, those sixteen massive oxen, stretching their necks, as if\r\nwatching the people climb the steep hill below. Each stands under a\r\ncolumned canopy. The popular fancy is that they commemorate the patient\r\nbeasts who dragged the stones for the cathedral up Laon's precipitous\r\ncrags, and there is nothing improbable in the idea. It was a day when\r\nSt. Francis was telling man to love his dumb fellow creatures. The\r\ntowers of Laon Cathedral are worthy of the magistral setting of the\r\nchurch on the edge of the abrupt hill where had grown the ancient city.\r\nFor miles Laon's towers command the plain, \"an assembly without rival\r\namong Gothic monuments.\" Incomplete though they are, Laon's five towers\r\ncome nearer to the ideal plan of seven spires than does any other\r\ncathedral. The corner tourelles pass from one form to another, as they\r\nrise, converting themselves into octagons. \"Ponder it well,\" wrote the\r\nXIII-century architect, Villard de Honnecourt, in his famous sketchbook.\r\n\"I have been in many lands, as you can see by this book, but never in\r\nany place is to be found a tower equal to Laon.\"\r\n\r\nFour of the towers are alike, each with the same long lancet openings,\r\nthe same free-standing pillars at the corners. Rows of crockets mark the\r\nmain lines, for the old-time masters were adepts in every device whereby\r\nto fix the eye on the essential. There are aspects when the fretwork\r\ndesigns made by Laon's towers against the sky are superb.\r\n\r\nThe date of the cathedral long gave rise to discussion in the days when\r\nmediæval archaeology was still hazy. No one now contends that the\r\npresent Notre Dame is the church which was patched up hastily by Bishop\r\nBartholomew de Vir after the fire of 1112. That conflagration was a\r\nsemi-lawless act. Laon's bishop was also its feudal proprietor, hence a\r\ngreedy baronage contended to hold the see. One Gaudry, a knight\r\nadventurer who had served under William the Conqueror in England and\r\nthere grown rich, obtained the bishopric of Laon by simony. All his talk\r\nwas of hawks, hounds, and hunting. During one of his absences in England\r\nthe townspeople set up a commune, and Gaudry bent his energies to\r\nfrustrate it. In an uprising in 1112 the infuriated populace murdered\r\nhim. The fire, started during the riots, spread to the cathedral, which\r\nwas practically consumed. The burghers, being unskilled in arms, were\r\nforced to call to their aid a fierce robber-baron of the house of Coucy,\r\nThomas of Marle, who, according as he found it profitable, fought, now\r\nagainst, now for, the communes.[59] It took the king of France half a\r\nlifetime to destroy that \"raging wolf,\" as Abbot Suger called him.\r\n\r\nGuizot has brought out that the XII-century uprisings against feudal\r\nexactions on the part of the burgesses were often favored by king and\r\nclergy. Such was the unformed state of society that no liberal general\r\nviews could be adhered to; the king is to be found granting charters to\r\nsome towns and marching against the rebellious citizens in others. The\r\nbishops of Noyon, Beauvais, and Soissons favored the people's claims.\r\nThe prelates of Rheims and Laon opposed them. Such feudalism as that of\r\nThomas of Marle meant permanent anarchy; for the royal power to\r\ncentralize authority then meant law and order.\r\n\r\nIt is sad to relate that no sooner did the burgess gain his civic rights\r\nthan he began to oppress the peasantry. Before the XIII century closed\r\nthere were outbreaks of the peasants against the prosperous townspeople.\r\nIn our own day has the cry of the underman, voiced by the old Norman\r\npoet, been silenced? \"We are men as they. The same in stature, the same\r\nin limb, and the same in strength--_for suffering_. Are we not men even\r\nas they?\"\r\n\r\nAt Laon the antagonism between bishop and citizens continued for a\r\ncentury; several times the charter was won, only to be abrogated later.\r\nThere is food for thought that all through the embittered struggle the\r\nbuilding of the cathedral was carried forward, and it was an enterprise\r\nthat required the collaboration of bishop and people. The people might\r\nfight their baron bishop to wrench from him certain civic rights, but\r\nthey were aware of the difference between his temporal claims and his\r\nspiritual authority. Their robust faith was not disconcerted by a\r\ndiscrepancy between \"Peter's key\" and \"Peter's sword.\" To the end of\r\ntime Peter will show his weak human side. Had he not denied thrice? Had\r\nnot another of the selected twelve betrayed for paltry lucre? Had not\r\neveryone of them run away in the hour of need?\r\n\r\nWhile Bishop Gaudri's ill-gotten gains were buying him a bishopric there\r\nwas in Laon's cathedral chapter a famous scholar who had stoutly\r\nopposed his election. Anselm of Laon, son of a laborer, \"the grave, the\r\nsweet, the prudent,\" was a pupil of St. Anselm of Bec and Canterbury.\r\nFor over forty years he taught in Paris and in Laon, and from the\r\nnucleus of his pupils, among whom were Guillaume de Champeaux and\r\nAbélard, was to emerge Paris University, which was not, however, to\r\nappear by name in history till 1215. Anselm of Laon (d. 1117), like his\r\ngreater namesake, was a pioneer in scholasticism, which brought to the\r\nstudy of Christian doctrine not only the aid of tradition, the Old and\r\nNew Testaments and the Church Fathers, but also the use of metaphysics\r\nand dialectics. The school of this master at Laon became a veritable\r\nuniversity to which flocked students from Italy, Spain, Germany, and\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nLaon Cathedral is justly entitled to carve the Liberal Arts on its\r\nfaçade. A score of the coming notable men of the XII century were\r\nAnselm's pupils; one of them was that bishop who began the Primary\r\nGothic tower of the cathedral at Rouen. Anselm and his brother trained\r\nthe youths who, having heard St. Norbert of Cologne preach in Laon\r\nCathedral, in 1120, followed him to Prémontré, in the forest of Coucy,\r\nwhich estate gave its name to the new order Norbert there founded. Like\r\nthe Cistercians, so swift an increase had the white canons of Prémontré\r\nthat they soon counted a thousand houses over Europe and were an\r\nevangelizing force for their century even as Cluny had been earlier and\r\nas the Franciscans and Dominicans were to be in the XIII century. The\r\ncitizens of Laon clamored for Anselm as their bishop when the miserable\r\nGaudri was killed in 1112, but he declined the honor and directed the\r\nchoice to the worthy Bartholomew de Vir, who restored temporarily the\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nIt is not known exactly when was laid the foundation stone of Laon's\r\nGothic cathedral. By its sculpture, the profiles, and the noticeable\r\nkeystones, the archæologists say that it belongs to the last third of\r\nthe XII century and that it kept to its original plans, though its\r\nbuilding continued into the first third of the XIII century. The\r\nbishop-founder was a pupil of Anselm's and himself had taught rhetoric\r\nin Paris. Gautier de Mortagne (1155-71) gave generously of his own\r\nrevenues to the new works. The choir he built ended in a semicircle and\r\nconsisted of the present three bays next the transept. There, and in the\r\nwest wall of the transept, the profiles are different from those\r\nelsewhere in the church.\r\n\r\nIn a second spell of work they finished the transept, the nave, the\r\ntowers, and the west façade just before 1200. Laon's façade ranks among\r\nthe great western frontispieces of Gothic architecture, a model for that\r\nof Rheims. What chiefly characterizes it are the profound shadows made\r\nby cavernous porches, projecting gables, and other varied surfaces. It\r\nhas been called a supreme composition in light and shade. In\r\naccentuating the upward surge of lines it was a pioneer. When the façade\r\nwas finished the choir was lengthened by seven bays, and now was\r\nterminated by a flat wall whose prototype is to be found in Laon town in\r\nthe church of St. Martin, an early-Gothic edifice, building about 1165.\r\nVarious regional churches used the square chevet. As the custom died out\r\nin France, it struck root in England, where the Cistercians made it\r\npopular. Those accustomed to the rectagonal chevet of the English\r\ncathedral may prefer that type, but to a lover of the apse of the French\r\ncathedral, of the curving procession path with its radiating chapels\r\nthat mystically suggests the thorn crown around the Sacred Head, it will\r\never seem a dull way to end a sanctuary precisely like a transept arm.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Laon was consecrated in 1237. That same century built\r\nthe treasure hall and the large chapel beside the west façade. The XIV\r\ncentury added side chapels between the buttresses, and in those chapels\r\nat Laon appears the academic precision of that skilled but dry period.\r\nAbout the same time was made a new southern portal for the transept, and\r\nthe wheel window over it was replaced by a big Rayonnant Gothic light.\r\n\r\nThe hill citadel called by Charlemagne in the _Chanson de Roland_ \"my\r\ngood town of Laon\" was held by the invader from August, 1914, to\r\nOctober, 1918. Though the city was shelled by the French, not a piece of\r\nglass in the cathedral was broken. St. Martin's abbatial, too, is\r\nintact, and the XII-century Templar's church, the only well-preserved\r\nmonument in France built by the great military Order. The Prussians'\r\nhorses were stabled at first in the cathedral till a general public\r\nprotest stopped such a desecration. When the Allies, under General Foch,\r\ndrove back the German lines in the final weeks of the war, the retreat\r\nwas too swift for much havoc to be wrought. On October 13, 1918, General\r\nMangin made his triumphal entry into Laon, whose much-enduring citizens\r\nflocked around him in the cathedral to chant a solemn _Te Deum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF SOISSONS[60]\r\n\r\n     The other evening before the ruins of a Cistercian abbey, that once\r\n     harbored St. Louis and his mother, Blanche of Castile, a group of\r\n     Alpine chasseurs and Zouaves fell to recounting their daily feats\r\n     of heroism just as in the times of chivalry the strong, swift\r\n     strophes of the _chanson de geste_ celebrated knightly prowess. To\r\n     the north, the cannon thundered.... And the next morning, a Sunday,\r\n     I assisted at Mass in a Gothic-vaulted hall that had served as\r\n     _promenoir_ for the monks of Cîteaux. Soldiers filled all the\r\n     wooden seats, others thronged the threshold, bareheaded in the\r\n     shadow of the ruins.... Then when the sacrifice of the body and\r\n     blood of our Lord was celebrated, a song rose in the dawn: \"_Kyrie\r\n     Eleison! God be praised!_\" And the soldiers within the chapel and\r\n     without sang before returning to battle as in the ancient _Chanson\r\n     de Saucourt: \"Kyrie Eleison!\"_ Even those harnessing the great cart\r\n     horses, those saddling their own restive mounts, those\r\n     extinguishing the fires of the night's bivouac, and those charging\r\n     the six-wheeled camions, all took up the canticle: \"_God be\r\n     praised! Kyrie Eleison!_\".... And the implacable cannonading to\r\n     the north echoed in the deep quarries, whence had come the stones\r\n     builded here for God's glory.\r\n\r\n    --A war picture of Longpont abbey,[61] by GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO, who\r\n     visited the battle-front in 1914.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Oxen on Laon's Towers_]\r\n\r\nTo-day the fair white city of Soissons lies a scene of desolation, only\r\nto be likened to a wrecked town of old-time barbarism. They say that\r\nSoissons Cathedral is more damaged than if a geological convulsion had\r\nwrecked it. Deliberately was it taken as a target, though, as French\r\ntroops held the highlands round the flat town, there can be no excuse\r\nthat the towers were used as posts of observation. The westernmost bays\r\nare ruined; the north side of the big church has been riddled with\r\nprojectiles; flying buttresses have been cut off; great rents show in\r\nroof and sides; the vaulting hangs in air; a pier lies prone, its stones\r\nscattered like a pack of cards; the aisles are dismantled, and the\r\nwindows, some of which Blanche of Castile gave in 1225, have been\r\nreduced to powdered dust. In one week of January, 1916, over three\r\nhundred projectiles fell on the church, said the old priest, who lived\r\nin the midst of the wreckage, to a visitor to whom he spoke gently of\r\nGod's mercy. In the once \"sweet and tranquil provincial city, whose soul\r\nwas the daughter of honorable simplicity, grass grows in the street.\r\nSoissons is a dead city. Its casementless windows fix you like the eye\r\nof the blind.\" Always has it lain in the path of war, this ancient\r\ncapital of Clovis that has ever been part of the very heart of France,\r\nbut never war such as this!\r\n\r\nHere, in 486, Clovis won the battle of Soissons that annihilated the\r\nlast remnant of Rome's empire in Gaul, and conquered the land to the\r\nLoire. In the evil days of the Hundred Years' War, Soissons suffered.\r\nSo depopulated was it by the XVI-century religious wars that it took\r\nover a century to recover. Nor did the Revolution spare the seat of the\r\nancient monarchies of France. In 1814 occurred an explosion of gunpowder\r\nthat wrecked precious windows in the cathedral, some of them the gifts\r\nof Philippe-Auguste. In 1870 the Prussian bombardment of Soissons\r\ndevastated what remained of the abbey church of St. Jean-des-Vignes,\r\nwhose Flamboyant Gothic spires have been mutilated again in the World\r\nWar.[62]\r\n\r\nUnder the southern flank of the shattered cathedral nestles the diamond\r\nof Primary Gothic art in France, the transept arm built by the crusading\r\nbishop, Nivelon de Chérisy. As by a miracle it has escaped. The most\r\nexquisite thing in France, many of us hold it to be. It has drawn its\r\ndevotees back to Soissons time and time again, this perfect thing so\r\nlittle heralded. They would test a second and a third time the\r\noverpowering first impression it had made. Perhaps it had been some\r\nhappy mood, some subtle lingering shadows of the late afternoon, that\r\nhad touched it momentarily to an ethereal grace. And then standing face\r\nto face again with its small and stately beauty, those who love this\r\nearly-Gothic monument of France know that its power is not a chance or\r\nborrowed comeliness.\r\n\r\nSit before it for hours; study the mystery and play of its lights and\r\nshadows; try to seize in what lies its young poesy of grace, its\r\nmaturity of dignity, \"its invincible impression of virginity.\" In vain\r\nto analyze it. Can that intangible quality which is sheer inevitable\r\nbeauty be dissected? Those who fall under the spell of its supernal\r\nloveliness lose all false shame that would prune adjectives, lest their\r\npraise be excessive. No glow of words can convey the something celestial\r\nhere. The nave and the choir of Soissons Cathedral are XIII-century\r\nGothic at its prime, and yet they seem merely to be the setting for a\r\njewel, for the small apse preceded by one bay, which is the transept's\r\nsouthern arm. That apse and bay are the culmination of the Romanesque\r\nideals, and at the same time, indissolubly part of the new and richer\r\nart, they crown the Primary Gothic hour.\r\n\r\nSoissons' chief church is better documented than Laon's. Bishop Nivelon\r\nI de Chérisy (a Chérisy fell on the field of honor in 1914) occupied the\r\nsee from 1176 to 1207. The Romanesque cathedral which he inherited had\r\nbecome inadequate, so the bishop gave land from his episcopal garden,\r\nand about 1180 the foundation of the south arm of the transept was laid.\r\nLike Noyon's transept, it terminated in a hemicycle, and its interior\r\nelevation was also in four stories, but here was attained a consummate\r\nsymmetry not achieved at Noyon. Soissons' curving transept arm is\r\nexceptional in having an ambulatory. The apsidal chapel which opens in\r\nits eastern wall has over it a similar chapel that gives on the tribune\r\ngallery. Slender columns with stilted arches are planted at the entrance\r\nof each of these chapels in the gracious fashion originated by the\r\nChampagne school of Gothic. It was born of a necessity, in order that a\r\nmore regular vaulting might be built over the curving aisle. St. Remi at\r\nRheims had used the same arrangement. So many are the points of\r\nresemblance between Soissons' transept arm and the choir of St. Remi's\r\nabbey church that it is thought the architect of the Champagne abbatial\r\nproceeded to Soissons later; there are the same profiles, the same plan,\r\nthe same encircling frieze of sculpture. At Soissons, the architect had\r\ngrown bolder and dared to diminish his supports. To have made Soissons'\r\ncurving wall of arches and colonnettes proves him to have been, not only\r\nwell practiced in mason-craft, but a man of genius who had visions. He\r\nhere created a thing apart. The exterior of the transept's arm is\r\nunimpressive and plain; the lower windows are round-arched. Inside, the\r\npointed arch reigns, however. \"The king's daughter is all glorious\r\nwithin.\"\r\n\r\nThe prelate who built Soissons Cathedral was a remarkable personage and\r\nplayed a foremost part on the Fourth Crusade. Villehardouin tells us\r\nthat it was Bishop Nivelon de Chérisy who was sent as an envoy to\r\nInnocent III, when against papal commands the Crusaders had turned aside\r\nto capture the Christian city of Zara on the Dalmatian coast. The\r\nbishop-ambassador found the pope at Viterbo and obtained from him the\r\nraising of the excommunication on condition that the knights should\r\nproceed direct to Palestine. We all know how, a second time, they went\r\nfilibustering. Among the first to scale the walls of Constantinople was\r\nNivelon de Chérisy; with him was the bishop of Troyes. When the chief\r\nbarons met to elect the first Latin emperor of Constantinople, it was\r\nBishop Nivelon who passed out to the waiting crowd to announce that\r\nBaldwin of Flanders had been chosen--Baldwin who began the Cloth Hall at\r\nYpres--and it was he who crowned Baldwin in St. Sophia. When that new\r\nemperor was captured by the Bulgars the bishop of Soissons returned to\r\nEurope for aid.\r\n\r\nAll the time that he was absent in the Holy Land Nivelon had devoted the\r\nrevenues of his see toward the renewal of the cathedral. Strangely\r\nenough, it was this same prelate who also built Soissons' choir, which\r\nin scale and plan differs so radically from the transept arm. The\r\nfleeting hour of Primary Gothic was over. The new art was moving forward\r\nswiftly; irresistible the development of its principles and impossible\r\nat such a time that the work of one decade could be similar to the\r\ndecade preceding it unless, as at Laon, the primitive plan was\r\ninsistently adhered to. Whoever the master that designed Soissons' choir\r\nand nave, he incorporated the perfect transept into his bigger church\r\nwith reverence. Not to dwarf it was his main care, for he bowed before\r\nthe touch of perfection in his predecessor's work, and sought to give to\r\nhis own monument, different though it was, a like clarity and noble\r\nsimplicity. Examine the skill with which choir and nave are joined to\r\nthe small transept arm. It is lower than they, it has four vertical\r\nstories to their three, and yet no discrepancy is felt. It was as if the\r\nnew builder said: \"Here is a miracle of force and grace, done in a\r\nfugitive hour never to be recaptured. Let us enshrine it fittingly.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1212 services were held in the finished choir. The nave proceeded\r\nwithout interruption and was in use in the first years of St. Louis'\r\nreign. Probably the final touches were given to it by that bishop of\r\nSoissons of whom Joinville tells, Mgr. Jacques de Castel, _fort et\r\nvaillant homme_, who started with the king on the crusade of 1248. After\r\nMansourah's battle and the disastrous retreat toward Damietta good\r\nBishop Jacques felt such a desire \"to go to God\" that he rushed alone to\r\nattack the infidels, whose swords soon \"dispatched him to God's company\r\nwith the martyrs.\"\r\n\r\nSingular good taste has at all times guided the builders of Soissons.\r\nThe XIV century decided to make a northern arm to the transept; and as\r\nif to avoid all hint of rivalry with its peerless neighbor, the new\r\nstructure was finished by a flat end wall without a portal.\r\n\r\nThe cylinder piers of Soissons choir and nave are a distinguishing trait\r\nof the church interior, neither too high nor too short. Before each is\r\nengaged a slender shaft which rises to the level of the springing and\r\ncauses the edifice to appear more lofty than its reality. Everywhere, in\r\nthe church, the fitting of the stones was done with peculiar nicety,\r\nthough the picking out of the mortar lines in black, a recent\r\ninnovation, was a sad mistake. In the choir and nave the clearstory\r\nwindows were an advance on those of Chartres, their model, for the\r\nlights were made longer, and the oculus, above the twin lancets,\r\nsmaller, which gave greater compactness to the whole composition. St.\r\nGereon at Cologne copied these windows. Marburg's church also was aided\r\nby Soissons.\r\n\r\nThe talc of this desolate city during the World War is heartrending. The\r\nGermans first entered Soissons on September 1, 1914. The mayor had fled.\r\nBut an admirable woman, Madame Macherez, the widow of a senator, went to\r\nthe _état-major_ of the Prussians and assumed the responsibility to keep\r\norder among the civilians: \"_Le maire c'est moi_.\" Already the poets of\r\nFrance have enshrined the memory of this heroine of sixty winters who\r\nsaved her city from pillage:\r\n\r\n    Le regard bleu comme strié de lave\r\n    De Jeanne Macherez qui nous sauva Soissons.\r\n    Ah! la vieille brave!\r\n\r\nFor ten days the Germans occupied the town. The first battle of the\r\nMarne caused their departure on September 12th. Then a French reverse in\r\nJanuary, 1915, let them draw near enough to the city to bring it within\r\nthe range of fire, and such was its tragic fate till the Germans'\r\nstrategic retreat in the spring of 1917. The enemy had intrenched\r\nhimself solidly in the vast quarries on the left bank of the Aisne, and\r\nmonth after month poured his fire on desolated Soissons. Then came the\r\nfinal grand act of the war. Rolling forward in overwhelming numbers in\r\nMarch, 1918, the invaders drove the French troops from Soissons after a\r\ndesperate resistance in the streets. There they encamped until the first\r\ndays of the following August, when the French army re-entered the\r\nsmoking ruins of a dead city over which stood a phantom cathedral.\r\n\r\nNoyon, Senlis, Sens, Laon, and Soisson, are with Notre Dame of Paris the\r\nfirst cathedrals of the national art. They are far from being the\r\ncomplete list of Primary Gothic monuments, which includes such churches\r\nas the Trinité at Vendôme, two churches at Étampes,[63] the collegiate\r\nof Notre Dame at Mantes, the Trinité at Fécamp, and Lisieux Cathedral.\r\nThere are the two towers built in an hour of religious enthusiasm: the\r\n_clocher vieux_ at Chartres and the belfry of St. Romain at Rouen. The\r\nnave of Angers Cathedral is the Primary Gothic of the Plantagenet\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe Attica of Gothic art is the Ile-de-France, and where Picardy touches\r\nit on the north, and Champagne on the south. In that land filled with\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten churches speaks the clarity of French genius in\r\nits classic simplicity. The beauty of such churches comes from their\r\nrightness of proportion, that quality which gives the most enduring joy\r\nin architecture, beyond all richness of detail or startling effect. From\r\nsuch churches one learns the difference between the architect born and\r\nthe architect made. The supreme quality of proportion must be innate; it\r\nis never acquired. The artist blessed with it may only produce a small\r\nmasterpiece, such a church as that of St. Yved of Braine or a St.\r\nLeu-d'Esserent, but one is sure that he would not exchange the glow\r\nwhich his work gave him for the fame of building even a Strasbourg.\r\n\r\nIt is in the early-Gothic churches of the Ile-de-France that the taste\r\nis best purified and trained. There the sense of beauty is\r\nspiritualized. In them art gives an entity to what is ethereal, art\r\nseems to make tangible what is impalpable. In them the heart feels the\r\nloveliness of the space inclosed as the eye rejoices in the inclosing\r\nwalls. There is something of poignancy in such churches. Standing in all\r\nthe promise of their youth, of the youth of the greatest architecture\r\nthe world ever produced, they gravely admonish us that beauty even as\r\ntheirs is but a momentary lifting of the veil. To such churches the\r\nmemory returns with nostalgic regret amid the magnificence of the Gothic\r\nexpansion, when the leaves opened wide to show the golden pollen. But\r\nthe sadness which the early-Gothic churches of France rouse in the soul,\r\nis it not the stumbling name we give to an eternal Hope? \"There are no\r\nhours in this cathedral,\" wrote Rodin of Soissons; \"there is\r\nEternity.\"[64]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABBATIALS OF ST. REMI AT RHEIMS, AND NOTRE DAME AT\r\nCHÂLONS-SUR-MARNE[65]\r\n\r\n     There are two things for which all the Faithful ought to resist\r\n     unto blood, Justice and Liberty.--PIERRE DE CELLE, Abbot of St.\r\n     Remi (1162-81).\r\n\r\nBefore closing our crowded chapter on Primary Gothic cathedrals, let us\r\nadd a few notes on a few early-Gothic churches. Those of chief interest,\r\nin the story of the national art, are the big abbey churches at Rheims\r\nand at Châlons, sister monuments, equal in size to cathedrals. So\r\nclosely do they resemble each other in plan and ornamentation that it is\r\nthought one architect planned both. They are the earliest Gothic\r\nedifices in Champagne.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame at Châlons-sur-Marne was reconstructed soon after 1157. Three\r\nperiods of work appear in it. The transept and the four towers--which\r\ngive an imposing air to the church--belong to the Romanesque rebuilding\r\nof 1130. The towers which stand between choir and transept are not set\r\nsymmetrically, since, in that to the south, use was made of the\r\nfoundations of an earlier tower, a boundary mark between the lands of\r\nthe big abbey and those of the bishop of Châlons.\r\n\r\nIn 1157, the Romanesque choir of Notre Dame collapsed, and when rebuilt\r\nthe citizens of the ancient city on the Marne displayed the same pious\r\nenthusiasm as had the men and the women of Chartres in 1145. In 1165,\r\nGuy de Bazoches, then a canon of Châlons Cathedral, wrote to his sister\r\nto describe how all ages and conditions brought material to the new\r\nchurch of Notre Dame-en-Vaux, and how the people, harnessed to carts,\r\nsang canticles as they labored. When the new Gothic choir was under way\r\nthe nave of 1130 was remodeled. The pier arches and the tribune arches\r\nwere made pointed, and the upper walls were raised in order that a\r\nGothic vaulting might be added.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame's choir is very beautiful. Its three apse chapels open on the\r\nambulatory, by columns and stilted arches, perhaps the first time this\r\ndisposition of Champagne Gothic was used. Soon it was repeated in St.\r\nRemi at Rheims. Auxerre and St. Quentin also used it, and it reached its\r\napotheosis in the ethereal charm of Soissons' transept. Notre Dame at\r\nChâlons was in other ways a precursor; here first were set in each bay\r\nof the clearstory three windows side by side, a triplet of lancets that\r\nstarted the complex fenestration of the new art. In its first plan were\r\nno flying buttresses, but they were soon added when it was found that\r\nthe thrust of the upper vaulting was not sufficiently counterbutted. In\r\nthe XV century the Flamboyant south porch was built. Of the XVI century\r\nare some rich windows of the school of Troyes, now set in the nave's\r\naisles. One of them represents the victory of Spain's crusaders over\r\nIslam at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, and is the best battle scene\r\ndepicted in colored glass. With its beautiful Gothic cathedral, its\r\nimmense abbatial, and all of its churches rich with storied windows, one\r\nis profoundly grateful that Châlons-sur-Marne only for a short hour\r\nearly in the World War formed part of that \"_ligne doulereuse et\r\ntriomphale, ce ruban de pourpre et de lumière qui s'étend de Belfort au\r\nrivage des Flandres, la Voie Sacrée_.\"\r\n\r\nTragic the fate of its sister abbatial, St. Remi, in martyred Rheims.\r\nThat grand ancestral church lies well-nigh mortally wounded on the field\r\nof honor. It stood up above the city as prominently as the cathedral\r\nitself, and has been mercilessly wrecked. The vaulting has fallen, and\r\ngreat rents have been torn in the walls of the precious Primary Gothic\r\nchoir. A recent traveler found that its devastated nave recalled gaunt\r\nJumièges.\r\n\r\nSome ten years after the reconstruction of Notre Dame at Châlons, the\r\nmonks of St. Remi began to make over their abbey church under the\r\ninspiration of Abbot Pierre de Celle, of the same lineage as the heiress\r\nof Braine who, with her husband, a brother of Louis VII, built the\r\nchurch of St. Yved. While John of Salisbury was a young student in\r\nFrance, Pierre de Celle entered into a friendship with him which\r\ncontinued to deepen till their death, both of them being men of the\r\nhighest culture, strong literary abilities, and solid character. Pierre\r\nde Celle succeeded the English scholar as bishop of Chartres in 1181;\r\n_summi et incomparabilis viri_, so his epitaph sums him up.\r\n\r\nIt was this distinguished churchman who built, about 1170, the superb\r\nchoir of St. Remi, and who remodeled as Gothic the ancient Romanesque\r\nnave. The choir had five radiating chapels, each of which opened on the\r\nambulatory in the beautiful Champagne way, by slender columns bearing\r\nstilted arches. As tribunes were built over the aisles, the wall\r\nelevation was in four stories, and below two of them ran friezes of\r\nsculptured foliage. As if the architect felt that he had thus\r\nover-accentuated the horizontal line, he bound his triforium and\r\nclearstory into one composition by continuous moldings, a precocious\r\nfirst step toward the glazed triforia of Rayonnant Gothic. Originally no\r\nflying buttresses braced this early-Gothic choir; those that were added,\r\nabout 1180, are probably the first ever made. Nothing could better show\r\nthe swift development of Gothic structure than to compare the plain old\r\nflying buttresses of St. Remi with the luxuriant counterbutting members\r\nof Rheims Cathedral built fifty years later.\r\n\r\nBetween St. Remi's choir and the hemicycle transept of Soissons\r\nCathedral there is such similitude of profile, detail, and plan that it\r\nis thought the same architect designed both. The able Pierre de Celle\r\nbuilt the two westernmost bays of St. Remi's nave, and opened the\r\ntribune on the middle vessel with Gothic arches. He also built the west\r\nfaçade, which to-day is ancient only in its lower stories, as it was\r\nreconstructed in 1840. The north tower was re-done in the XII century;\r\nthe south one is of the XI century, Abbot Herimar's time.\r\n\r\nWith book in hand should be read the complicated story of St. Remi's\r\nnave and transept, the ancient Romanesque edifice re-dressed as Gothic\r\nin 1170. Nothing remains of the church built in the IX century under\r\nBishop Hincmar of Rheims. The oldest parts extant are the piers of the\r\nnave, which belonged to the reconstruction of the abbatial by Abbot\r\nAirard (1005-33). His successor, Thierry (d. 1041), decided that the\r\nworks then under way were on too elaborate a scale to be within his\r\nmeans, so he simplified the plan. The outer side aisles were suppressed,\r\nthe archivolts were doubled, the bays widened, and the old columns\r\nreplaced by compound piers. In the transept his work still exists in the\r\nwest wall (north arm) where are two stories of arcades supported by\r\nthick, short, cylinder piers whose capitals are coarsely carved acanthus\r\nleaves.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the transept (save what was added in 1170 to connect it with\r\nthe Gothic choir and the re-dressed nave) is the work of Abbot Herimar\r\nwho raised the west towers. Under him occurred the notable dedication of\r\nSt. Remi's new Romanesque church, in 1049, by Leo IX, the reformer, with\r\nwhom the Benedictine Order took possession of the papacy for some vital\r\nyears of needed regeneration.\r\n\r\nSt. Bruno of Cologne, the future founder of the Carthusian Order, was a\r\nstudent in the episcopal school of Rheims while Romanesque St. Remi was\r\nbuilding. And later he returned from Germany to direct the school from\r\n1057 to 1075 with great prestige. His most notable pupil, Eudes de\r\nChâtillon, became the pope of the First Crusade, Urban II. Feeling the\r\ncall for a life of prayer and retirement, Bruno thought of joining the\r\ngroup of earnest men about to commence the Cistercian Order, but his\r\ndestiny led him to Grenoble, near which in the mountains he began the\r\nGrande Chartreuse (1084) where they say reform never was needed.[66]\r\n\r\nIn St. Remi's abbatial the last phase of Gothic art was to be\r\nrepresented. The transept's south façade is Flamboyant, and over its\r\nsculptured portal is a highly colored XV-century window. The façade was\r\nfinished by Abbot Robert de Lenoncourt (d. 1531), who later became\r\narchbishop of Rheims. To his abbey church he presented ten rich\r\ntapestries relating the life of the first bishop of the city, St.\r\nRemigius, who baptized Clovis in 496, and whose rule of seventy years is\r\nthe longest spiritual reign on record. Clovis and Clotilda founded the\r\nabbey. At its church altar St. Louis was knighted. On the day of Charles\r\nVII's coronation the barons rode their steeds into the basilica,\r\ndismounting at the sanctuary to ask for the sacred ampulla needed for\r\nthe king's anointing in the cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn the clearstory windows of St. Remi's choir were thirty-three lancets\r\nin which were portrayed the archbishops of Rheims from holy Remigius to\r\nRobert of France, brother of Louis VII, who was ruling here from 1162 to\r\n1175, while Abbot Pierre was building his choir. The windows were\r\nprobably set up in the time of Archbishop Robert's successor, Archbishop\r\nGuillaume of Champagne, who had finished the cathedral at Sens. They\r\nwere memorable for their lovely browns and greens, and were allied,\r\nundoubtedly, with St. Denis' glass, though executed by local workers.\r\nDeep borders surrounded each lancet. Similar ornate borders and a\r\nmagnificent deep blue color distinguished still older XII-century\r\nwindows in the tribune gallery. The central lancet was an extraordinary\r\nCrucifixion, somewhat like that at Poitiers. An irreparable loss to art\r\nis the destruction of St. Remi's windows, though it is said that some of\r\nthem were dismounted in time and carried to a place of safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. QUIRIACE CHURCH[67] AT PROVINS\r\n\r\n     Provins, une des plus charmantes villes de France, rivalise avec la\r\n     vallée de Cachemire.... Des croisés rapportèrent les roses de\r\n     Jéricho dans cette délicieuse vallée, où, par hasard, elles prirent\r\n     des qualités nouvelles, sans rien perdre de leur couleurs.--BALZAC,\r\n     _Pierrette_ (whose scene is Provins).\r\n\r\nAnother Primary Gothic church in Champagne is St. Quiriace at Provins,\r\nwhich one goes out of one's way to see because Provins is one of the\r\nmost individual little towns in France, still in part surrounded by\r\nmassive XII-and XIII-century ramparts. Thibaut IV the Singer added to\r\nthe great walls of the lower town about 1230. They say that when\r\ncrusaders drew near to Jerusalem on its hill encircled by its walls and\r\ntowers they often cried out, \"Provins!\" Once the population of this\r\nshrunken little city rivaled that of Paris. Here were held annual fairs\r\nto which flocked the merchants of Europe, and the sensible counts of\r\nChampagne encouraged their visitors by wise regulations and strictest\r\njustice. The money of Provins was accepted in Florence and Rome.\r\n\r\nThe valley of roses was the favorite residence of the reigning counts.\r\nHere Thibaut IV, the most celebrated lyric poet of the Middle Ages,\r\nwrote his songs that wedded the art of the Midi troubadour with the salt\r\nof the northern trouvère. His son, Thibaut V, married the daughter of\r\nSt. Louis and brought her in state to Provins, \"_où ils firent leur\r\nentrée accompagnés d'une grande foison de barons_,\" wrote Joinville, who\r\nhad helped to arrange the match. Thibaut V's heart is contained in a\r\nXIII-century monument now in the chapel of the Hôtel Dieu, which\r\nhospital was originally the ancient palace of the countesses of\r\nChampagne. Thibaut V and his wife died returning from the tragic last\r\ncrusade of Louis IX. Their niece Jeanne married the king of France, and\r\nthe prosperous days of Champagne ended when it merged its independence\r\nin the royal domain, for new regulations soon impaired the popularity of\r\nits famous fairs. It was Countess Jeanne of Navarre who persuaded her\r\nseneschal, Joinville, to write his reminiscences.\r\n\r\nIn the days when Provins was a world center St. Quiriace church was\r\nbegun about 1160 by Henry the Liberal, the reigning count who was\r\nwarmest patron of John of Salisbury when the latter, forced to quit\r\nEngland, lived in Provins. Little more than the choir of St. Quiriace\r\nnow remains. In the tympanum of a late-Gothic portal is a XIII-century\r\nimage of Christ. The semicircular chevet is boxed in a square ambulatory\r\non which open square eastern chapels. The shafts are banded with\r\nannulets. There is Romanesque feeling in the zigzag ornamentation on the\r\nheavy ribs; the round arch reigns in the triforium, although the pier\r\narcades below are pointed. The choir shows a curious experiment in\r\nvaulting hardly to be called successful: three bays are embraced by the\r\nvault section of eight branches.\r\n\r\nSt. Quiriace crowns the hilltop; in the lower town is St. Ayoul, whose\r\nportal sculpture (c. 1160) is of the same type as the three western\r\ndoors at Chartres, as is the portal of St. Loup-de-Naud\r\n(Seine-et-Marne), close by.[68] Those who have fallen under the spell of\r\nChartres' fascinating column statues will always study their sister\r\nimages with interest.\r\n\r\nEpitaphs on the walls of St. Quiriace recall two true shepherds of this\r\nchurch, one, who went daily into the hills to teach children and to tend\r\non the sick poor in their homes, and the other, who opened up the\r\nforgotten crypt and left a school and presbytery to his parish. There\r\nis a quaintly worded tablet of the XVI century telling of the _haute et\r\npuissante dame_, the Marquise de Chenoise, who had \"for God a tender\r\nsolid piety; for her husband a submissive, respectful love; for her\r\nchildren a Christian and reasonable tenderness; for her friends a\r\nsincere and generous affection; for the poor charity without limit; and\r\nfor the rest of the world _une bonté, une douceur, une honestété\r\ncharmante_.\" One would not mind being the rest of the world for this\r\ngracious person. Both her sons were killed in one week, fighting under\r\nTurenne, so she passed the last years of her life in a retirement, which\r\n\"she sanctified by prayer, and her prayer she nourished and sustained by\r\ngood works.\" The robust piety of Bossuet's preaching breathes in such\r\nrecords. In St. Remi's abbatial at Rheims is the eulogy of another good\r\nlady of Champagne who was \"Rachel in beauty, Rebecca in fidelity,\r\nSuzanna in purity, Tabitha in piety of heart, Ruth in sentiment, and\r\nAnna by good works.\" Paragons those old-time ladies seemed to be!\r\n\r\n\r\nST. YVED AT BRAINE[69]\r\n\r\n     I am just back from the battle line in that Royal Domain of\r\n     Soissons, where the soul of ancient France seems more itself than\r\n     in any other region, country of martyrs, and of kings, of\r\n     Merovingian crypts, of the donjon of Coucy, of the five apses of\r\n     St. Yved--realm of the first race of rulers bearing vestiges of the\r\n     greatest history of France.--GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO, 1914.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, St. Yved at Braine is not so much a Primary Gothic\r\nmonument as it is a link between that first tentative hour and the\r\nfuller development of the national art represented by Rheims and Amiens.\r\nIn the same group as Braine, between Primary Gothic and the Era of the\r\nGreat Cathedrals, are St. Leu d'Esserent, Montréal, Vézelay's choir, and\r\nthe church of St. Laumer at Blois.\r\n\r\nBraine, on the ancient Roman highroad between Rheims and Soissons, had\r\nbeen a farm of the Frankish kings. In the VII century it belonged to\r\nthe father of St. Ouen, and it was here that the future bishop of Rouen,\r\nas a child, was blessed by a passing guest, the Irish missionary St.\r\nColumbanus, whose Celtic rule of Luxeuil dominated, in Gaul, the century\r\ncalled of saints.\r\n\r\nLady Agnes of Braine espoused a son of Louis VI, the turbulent Count of\r\nDreux (d. 1188), and, from them came the funds for St. Yved, the second\r\nfoundation of the new Order of Prémontré. The recorded date of the\r\nenterprise is from 1180 to 1216, but as the church is perfectly\r\nhomogeneous, it must have been built in one campaign, probably in main\r\npart before the dedication of 1216.\r\n\r\nAs a composition, the plan of the collegiate is original. The apse\r\nchapels on each side of the choir chapel are placed on the bias so that\r\nthe sanctuary opens out like a fan, with five altars visible at the same\r\ntime. The arrangement was copied in far-off Hungary in St. Martin's\r\nchurch at Kassovie, built for the king by the wandering Picard artist\r\nVillard de Honnecourt. In Cologne the church of St. Gereon, and in\r\nMarburg that of St. Elizabeth, show the influence of Braine. St. Léger's\r\nabbatial at Soissons copied it. St. Yved has a square transept-crossing\r\ntower that opens still farther the central part of the edifice. Carved\r\nabout the interior is a cordon of free springtime foliage. There is\r\nyouth in every line of this beautiful white church. The superb\r\nmonocylindrical columns and their capitals are robust virility itself.\r\nEverywhere is firmness of touch, and never has the unity been marred by\r\npatchwork reconstructions. Like its neighbor, Soissons, the same nicety\r\nof stonework is shown.\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution the collegiate at Braine harbored an unparalleled\r\ncollection of tombs, since here for centuries were laid to rest the\r\nbarons and bishops of the proud family of Dreux, warriors at Bouvines,\r\ncrusaders, and donors of storied windows at Chartres and Rheims. The\r\nfour west bays of the church of Braine were stupidly demolished after\r\nthe Revolution, because funds for repairs were at that time lacking.\r\nFrom the destroyed portal were saved the two statues now set in the\r\nchoir's wall. They represent the Coronation of Our Lady; the robes flow\r\neasily and there is scarcely a touch of Byzantine rigidity left in them.\r\n\r\nTwice during the late World War was Braine's collegiate in the direct\r\npath of invasion. The first battle of the Marne freed it, but in May,\r\n1918, the Germans again entered the little town. Then swept forward the\r\nsecond battle of the Marne, and Braine was liberated in September. One\r\ncan only pray that, in such hasty retreats, St. Yved escaped mutilation.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LEU D'ESSERENT[70]\r\n\r\n     I think that that style which is called Gothic is endowed with a\r\n     profound and a commanding beauty, such as no other style possesses\r\n... and which probably the Church will not see surpassed till it\r\n     attain to the Celestial City.... The Gothic style is as harmonious\r\n     and as intellectual as it is graceful.--CARDINAL NEWMAN.\r\n\r\nSt. Leu d'Esserent is one of the small but perfect churches of the\r\nclassic Ile-de-France that satisfy both eye and soul by the exquisite\r\njustness of their proportions. Its serene white charm is unobtrusive.\r\nOnly a master of the inmost heart of France could have produced the\r\nassured rightness of its proportions. Unforgettable are the moments\r\nspent in this Benedictine abbatial on the Oise; sometimes up and down\r\nits lovely white avenue flits some happy lost bird, rejoicing in the\r\nparadise of quietude he has found.\r\n\r\nThe quarries round St. Leu d'Esserent were noted, and many a church of\r\nFrance has been made of their firm white stones. The origin of Gothic\r\nart is comprised, thinks M. Lefèvre-Pontalis, in this region where good\r\nquarries abounded, with Senlis taken as a center. A line from Senlis to\r\nLaon, if carried round, would pass through Rheims, Provins, Montereau,\r\nÉtampes, Vernon, Amiens, Péronne, St. Quentin. Well within that\r\ncircumference lies St. Leu d'Esserent.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine church stands on prominent foundations overlooking the\r\nriver loved of Corot and Daubigny. The priory was founded and presented\r\nto great Cluny by a knight of Esserent as thank-offering for his ransom\r\nfrom the Saracens by monks of St. Benedict. Of the church built in that\r\nXI century, there remain only the two stout columns, with archaic\r\ncapitals, which now are embedded in the westernmost bay of the nave.\r\n\r\nAbout 1150 the present church was begun, and for a century continued\r\nbuilding, in three distinct bouts of work. First was made the west\r\nfaçade, only one of whose Romanesque towers was ever finished with a\r\nspire, the octagonal faces of which were relieved by curious lancelike\r\nridges not repeated elsewhere. In the narthex, or porch between the\r\ntowers, was tried an experiment to eliminate the so-called domical shape\r\nof the first Gothic vaults. The transverse arches were loaded with\r\nmasonry to raise them to the vault's apex. Experimental also are the\r\nungainly diagonals, in part ornamented with Norman chevrons, that span\r\nthe tribune over the forechurch (c. 1150). The ribs are not free of the\r\nvault web, so elasticity is missing.\r\n\r\nDuring the last quarter of the XII century, the chevet was built, as\r\nwere the two towers placed beside the apse, an arrangement derived from\r\nRhenish churches. Of that time, too (c. 1180), is the double bay,\r\nsurmounted by a sexpartite vault which precedes the apse. There is no\r\ntransept. The recently finished choir of Senlis Cathedral influenced the\r\nambulatory and apse chapels of St. Leu. At Senlis and here occur the\r\nearliest examples of double flying buttresses. The six bays of the nave\r\nwere added about 1220, after a pause in the works. Previously, each bay\r\nof the church had been lighted by a single lancet; now two lancets\r\nsurmounted by an oculus were used, which added much dignity to the\r\nexterior aspect of the edifice. Over the axis chapel was built a second\r\nstory. The unvaulted tribunes, above the side aisles, were transformed\r\ninto a sort of triforium by building a wall slightly behind their\r\narcaded openings. As that wall was pierced by some odd little square\r\nwindows, this may be regarded as one of the first essays of a glazed\r\ntriforium, the feature which was soon to develop into the decorative\r\nrichness of St. Denis, Troyes, Le Mans, Tours, and Beauvais.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNotre Dame of Paris and Other Churches of the Capital[71]\r\n\r\n     It is important to meditate often and with ardor and respect on the\r\n     documents which the ancestors have left us.--ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Era of the Great Cathedrals was inaugurated by Notre Dame of Paris,\r\nthe most imposing Gothic church hitherto attempted. The popular voice\r\nhas chosen to group it among the chief four, with Chartres, Rheims, and\r\nAmiens--all four of them dedicated to Our Lady, though in a special way\r\nNotre Dame of the capital seems to have appropriated the name.\r\n\r\nOf the four, the cathedral of Paris was the first built, and traits of\r\nthe Romanesque epoch lingered in it, such as the tribune galleries over\r\nthe side aisles, the division of its interior wall into four vertical\r\nstories, and the Byzantine feeling of its earlier sculpture. The piers\r\nwere massive single columns of true majesty. In the sixth pier of the\r\nnave, counting from the east, an experiment was tried when an engaged\r\nshaft was added to its front. The seventh pier (c. 1192) marks a date in\r\nthe development of Gothic structure since with it was made the type of\r\nground support which was to predominate in the XIII century--four\r\nengaged shafts around a central pillar. When the middle core was made\r\nelliptical, as at Beauvais, the type pier was achieved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Notre Dame of Paris. View from the South_]\r\n\r\nNotre Dame of Paris used the sexpartite system which calls for\r\nalternating ground supports. Either the uniform piers here were laid\r\nbefore a sexpartite vault was thought of, or else the architect\r\npreferred them for æsthetic reasons, and in this case he certainly was\r\nright. Double aisles about both nave and choir differentiate the\r\ninterior of Notre Dame of Paris from that of the average cathedral. The\r\nfar-stretching aisles of this church compose vistas of unsurpassed\r\npicturesqueness and variety of perspective. Some have said that the\r\ncentral nave is not sufficiently wide for such a stretch of lateral\r\naisles, and have found a certain monotony in the clearstory, tribune,\r\nand pier arcade being of equal height. Originally, beneath the\r\nclearstory were small circular unglassed apertures giving on the rafters\r\nover the tribune. Those oculi were done away with during the XIII\r\ncentury, when the clearstory windows were lengthened for the better\r\nlighting of the church. During his able restoration of Notre Dame, M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc found hidden under the pavement some of the discarded\r\nwindow frames, and he took the liberty (which many regret) of replacing\r\na few in the bays near the transept, thus marring the uniformity of the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nDespite the enlargement of the upper windows and the changes made to\r\ngive more light to the tribunes, none can deny that, in gloomy weather,\r\nNotre Dame can be somber and even cavernous. Yet who, of its devotees,\r\nwould have it different? Supreme cathedral it is for that supremest of\r\nhymns, the _Dies Iræ_--sound and sense and vision welded. To exchange\r\nits severe majesty for an expanse of brilliant glass--save Suger's\r\nglass--is unthinkable. In Notre Dame you comprehend the spectacular\r\nrepentances of the Middle Ages. Here, when pestilence stalked the city\r\nor the enemy was at the gate, have echoed the _Miserere_ and the _Libera\r\nnos, Domine_.[72]\r\n\r\nThere is an individuality in the cathedral of Paris that overrides every\r\ncriticism. Perpetually does the worshiper find in it new aspects, in the\r\ndim, low aisles full of mystery, in the gleam of transept windows as\r\nseen through the tribune arches while one listens, perhaps, to a lenten\r\nfriar preacher discoursing of sin, justice, and the judgment to come;\r\nhere on the very spot where Dominic himself taught the same sobering\r\nlessons; here where, six hundred years later, his son, Lacordaire, held\r\nthe manhood of Paris spellbound. Or, again, one gazes down the length\r\nof the church, with its incomparable perspective, while around one rise\r\nthe voices of strong men fresh from the battle of Verdun, fresh from\r\ntheir firm \"They shall not pass,\" and their _Magnificat_ of thanksgiving\r\nto Notre Dame swells in a volume of sound like the eternal sea. The\r\ncrusaders of St. Louis' time prayed, too, for strength in Notre Dame of\r\nParis.[73]\r\n\r\nThe curve of the sanctuary as seen from the west end of the nave is one\r\nof the splendors of the monument, and no chevet ever built surpassed it.\r\nThe cause of the magic is practical--a structural problem solved, as is\r\nthe case with the best aspects of Gothic art. At that eastern curve\r\nextra piers were inserted between the double aisles in order to obviate\r\nthe difficulty of vaulting such irregular trapeze-shaped sections.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiast maintains that the exterior of Notre Dame surpasses that\r\nof all other cathedrals. Certainly better transept façades were never\r\nmade nor was apse more romantic than that of the chief church of Paris,\r\nas it rises in three grandiose steps, with flying buttresses of wide\r\nspan leaping with an audacity that fairly catches the breath; and again\r\nthe success is a case of sound science solving a problem.\r\n\r\nThe west façade is an accepted classic, \"an architectural glory of\r\nFrance,\" irreproachable. Once the intelligence has grasped its\r\npre-eminence, allegiance to it will never waver. The frontispieces of\r\nRheims and of Rouen are richer and may appeal more to the imagination.\r\nIt is possible that the severe dignity of Paris may even chill at first.\r\nBut what clarity of plan! Four strong buttresses accentuate the big\r\nsquare parallelogram. Excess of ornamentation has been avoided in order\r\nthat the whole may stand forth. Lest the two towers might appear to rise\r\nabruptly from the massive, some master hand made there the graceful open\r\ncolonnade.[74]\r\n\r\nThe façade of Notre Dame is true to its epoch in its appeal to the\r\nintellect rather than to the emotions. It was built in the golden age of\r\nscholasticism, when religion and philosophy went hand in hand, when the\r\nteachers in the schools of Paris, the _cité lettré_, the _oeil du\r\nmonde_, thought that Faith and Reason could give mutual aid one to the\r\nother, that the truths of Revelations could coincide with the natural\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\nScholasticism has been belittled by the modern sophists from the time of\r\nthe XVIII-century Encyclopædist to the XIX-century superman. Yet\r\nscholasticism was an important factor in the formation of the French\r\nintellect, which, in its virile youth, it put through a course of useful\r\nmental gymnastics. Precisely the race, whose ancestors sharpened their\r\nwits in the _Sic-et-Non_ debates of the mediæval schools of Paris, is\r\nto-day pre-eminent in precision of language and freedom from fogginess\r\nof thought. Easy enough for the modern mind to ridicule the quarrel of\r\ngenerations over nominalism and realism, pursued with the personal heat\r\nof a modern political campaign.[75] Certainly the abuse of the\r\nscholastic system led to hair-splitting disputes, for the deductive\r\nmethod, when carried to excess, ends in thin subtlety. But why judge a\r\nsystem by its extremes? Because XIV-century architecture grew rigid with\r\nset formulas and the abuse of its own laws, does that discredit the\r\nvirile period to which it succeeded?\r\n\r\nThe bishops who built Notre Dame were notable scholastics. The\r\ngenerations who built cathedrals were impregnated with the certainty\r\nthat what was Christian was rational. Scholasticism produced St. Thomas\r\nAquinas, whose philosophy has outlived a dozen systems, whose _Summa_\r\nwas placed on the assembly table of the Council of Trent, the sole\r\ncompanion of the Scriptures, Aquinas, whose sanity of ethics and\r\ndoctrine was held up by Leo XIII as the best guide amid current errors.\r\n\r\nWith Aquinas, who taught the inextricable union of Faith and Reason,\r\nChristian philosophy reached its zenith.[76] Too long has it been the\r\nfashion to look on orthodoxy as a sign of mental inferiority. Professors\r\nstill dismiss the _Summa_ with a scathing line. They have never opened\r\nits pages, perhaps, but second-hand knowledge to vast regions of human\r\nthought is no impediment to a chair in the modern university.\r\n\"Abstractions as repulsive as they are frivolous,\" is the dictum of a\r\ngroup of present-day French scholars who seem to think that to belittle\r\nthings mediæval is proof of patriotism.\r\n\r\nWe have looked on at the rehabilitation of certain mediæval saints. It\r\nwas not so long ago that the poor man of Assisi was patronized as an\r\nignorant fanatic. The appeal of St. Francis is to the emotions, while\r\nthat of St. Thomas Aquinas is to the intellect, so, perhaps, it is\r\nexpecting too much to hope that some day the average man may appreciate\r\nthis thinker who set sane boundaries round the human mind. Too long have\r\nthe prime sanities of reason been flouted by hazy abstract thinking in\r\nthe void; too long has man shut his eyes to the fact that a crime of the\r\nintellect is of more consequence to mankind than a crime against the\r\ncivil law; too long has applause been given to philosophers who\r\nobliterated the distinctions between right and wrong--like Hegel,\r\nteaching the identity of Being and non-Being--so that the very soul of\r\nthe peoples grew perverted and appalling cataclysms threatened\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nWhat the older centuries thought of Aquinas, the painter as well as the\r\npoet tells us. In the Louvre hangs Benozzo Gozzoli's picture of the\r\n_doctor angelicus_ sitting in luminous repose amid pope, doctors,\r\nsaints, and the sages of antiquity, and the inscription runs: \"_Vere hic\r\nest lumen ecclesiæ_.\" And in Milan hangs Piero della Francesca's\r\nprofound study of the saint. \"I place Plato high,\" wrote a sound French\r\nthinker, \"but as I see Aquinas he is as superior to Plato, and even\r\nmore, than is our knowledge of the physical world to that of the\r\nGreeks.... He embraces St. Augustine, Aristotle, and Plato.\"\r\n\r\nOften has it been said that a Gothic cathedral is the _Summa_ translated\r\ninto stone, logical, ordered, interlinked, leaving nothing to chance, a\r\nsound skeleton on a sound base, so securely balanced that great windows\r\ncould be opened on the sky, like flashes of intuitive genius lifting the\r\nsoul to the infinite. Many were the points by which St. Thomas touched\r\nGothic art in its heyday. He was a student in Cologne when its mighty\r\ncathedral was begun. He was in Paris during the years when the transept\r\nof Notre Dame was building, and the Sainte-Chapelle and St. Denis'\r\nabbatial. By blood he was related to St. Louis, and often was his guest\r\nat table, where talk must have turned on that keen interest of the\r\nhour--the making of Gothic churches.[77] He was to die (1274) in\r\nCistercian Fossanuova, the first Gothic monument of Italy. And his great\r\nwork, like many a cathedral, was left unfinished.\r\n\r\nNever was aspiration toward the infinite more passionate than in that\r\nscholastic disputing, commune-winning, cathedral-building, crusading\r\nage. The absorbing interest for old and young, for bishop and layman,\r\nfor king and poor student, was to know God, to know their own souls, to\r\nlearn how to make life more worthy of God. \"In the entire length of\r\nFrance,\" wrote the archbishop of Sens to the pope, in 1140, \"in towns\r\nand even in villages, in the schools and outside them, all, even simple\r\npeople and children, are disputing on the Holy Trinity.\" Paris became\r\nthe center of the seething new interest in theology and philosophy. In\r\n1109 Guillaume de Champeaux opened a school of logic on the slopes of\r\nSt. Geneviève's hill (where to this day reigns Paris University), and\r\nsoon all Christendom frequented it.[78] His pupil, and later his\r\nopponent, was Abélard, brilliant, restless knight-errant of dialectics,\r\nwhom the modern orthodox student finds to be a forerunner of the new\r\nmethod of biblical criticism rather than a rationalist.\r\n\r\nIn the abbey of St. Victor, whose free classes were founded by Guillaume\r\nde Champeaux when harried by Abélard, there gathered a group of mystic\r\nscholars and poets: Hugues de St. Victor, the Augustine of his day (d.\r\n1141), whose work on the sacraments was an interlinked system of\r\ntheology. Lucid in intellect, tender in sentiment, was this friend of\r\nSt. Bernard, whom Dante places in Paradise with St. Anselm and St.\r\nBonaventure (_Par._, xii: 30); and Hugues' disciple, Richard de St.\r\nVictor (d. 1173), ranked in Paradise as the companion of the Venerable\r\nBede and St. Isidore of Seville, \"Richard, who in contemplation was\r\nmore than man\" (_Par._, x: 132); and Adam de St. Victor, one of the best\r\npoets of the XII century, whose sequences and rimed proses fill the\r\nliturgy. Another pupil of the learned Hugues was Pierre Lombard, who\r\ndied bishop of Paris in 1160; his _Book of Sentences_ became a textbook\r\nin European universities for centuries to come.\r\n\r\nFrom the cathedral school and the mount of St. Geneviève and St.\r\nVictor's cloister[79] evolved the University of Paris, \"elder daughter\r\nof France,\" whose title first appears in 1215, the oldest university in\r\nEurope with that of Bologna--one the high priestess of theology, the\r\nother the leader in canon and civil law. In the XII-century schools of\r\nParis, John of Salisbury met Thomas Becket and Nicholas Breakspear (the\r\nEnglish pope, Adrian IV), and there the future Innocent III became the\r\nfriend of Stephen Langton.\r\n\r\nBy the XIII century over thirty thousand students thronged the colleges\r\nin Paris. Aquinas taught in the Dominicans' branch of the university, in\r\nwhich same convent, called the Jacobins, lived the reader of Louis IX,\r\nVincent de Beauvais, whose four _Mirrors_ were depicted in the imagery\r\nof the great cathedrals. No age was ever more enamored of encyclopædias.\r\nTo overclassify was a characteristic of the times which even the great\r\nAquinas could not escape. They say that over five hundred monks, under\r\nthe guidance of the Dominican cardinal, Hugues de Saint-Cher, were busy\r\nin the rue St. Jacques preparing the first concordance of Scriptures.\r\nThe entire Bible was translated into French in the XIII century. In the\r\nFranciscans' branch of the University St. Bonaventure taught. The king's\r\nchaplain, Robert de Sorbon, founded a house where poor students could\r\nlive in common. Canterbury's archbishop, St. Edmund Rich, was a pupil in\r\nParis, then a teacher. Roger Bacon, first to grasp the importance of\r\nexperimental science, studied there, and so did Robert Grosseteste,\r\nbuilder of Lincoln Cathedral, whom Bacon said excelled all other masters\r\nin his range of useful knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe smelting pot of modern society those fecund formative years of the\r\nXII and XIII centuries have been called. A life-time's study it would be\r\nto draw adequately the picture of the one city of Paris then, when\r\nPhilippe-Auguste and his grandson, St. Louis, were busy raising their\r\nLouvre and their Cité palaces, their Notre Dame, and their\r\nSainte-Chapelle, busy cleaning the city streets and the city laws; when\r\none scholarly bishop succeeded another as slowly rose the capital's\r\ncathedral, when lovely Latin hymns poured from St. Victor's abbey, while\r\nin the street the students sang the new lays of trouvère and troubadour,\r\ntelling of \"love that is a thing so high,\" of Roland and the _gestes_ of\r\npaladins, of the Celtic heroes, Tristan, Lancelot, and Percival; when\r\nall the newly awakened intellectual and art life was astir welding old\r\nblood and new, making Frenchmen, at last, of Celt and Latin and Frank,\r\nmaking a kind of commonwealth of the nations that met in universities\r\nwhose common speech still was Latin.[80]\r\n\r\nThat there were black shadows in the picture, none deny. There were\r\npillages and massacres. It was an agitated day full of tumults and\r\nheresies and terrible reprisals. One has only to read the censures of\r\nSt. Bernard and of Innocent III to learn of the cupidity and the lust.\r\nJoinville has told of a sink of corruption lying within a stone's throw\r\nof the saint-king's crusading camp. But, above all the lawlessness, the\r\nmen of those ages of faith aspired. Their acts might fall short; their\r\nprinciples remained sound. \"No easy-going doctrines, then, to legitimize\r\nvice,\" says Ozanam. Man knew how to beat his breast in humble\r\nrepentance. He lifted his eyes toward an ideal so far above himself that\r\nit was given his human weakness to build cathedrals such as Notre Dame\r\nof the capital. Not so does he build when as superman he sits on a\r\nself-raised altar.\r\n\r\nThe virtuous bishop, who had most to do with the erection of the\r\ncathedral of Paris, had been a student and later a teacher of\r\nscholasticism. Maurice de Sully was born of simple parentage in the\r\nvillage of Sully-sur-Loire, and he came as a poor scholar to the great\r\ncity. His abilities and the integrity of his conduct won him\r\nrecognition, and after teaching belles-lettres, he was elected to the\r\nsee of Paris as the seventy-second successor of St. Denis. From 1160 to\r\n1196 he directed his diocese, a true shepherd whose special care was the\r\ntraining of young priests. Crowds flocked to his sermons, wrote a\r\ncontemporary. He took an active part on the side of Thomas Becket during\r\nthe English archbishop's struggle with Henry II, and it was he who\r\nconsecrated as bishop of Chartres Becket's friend, the intellectual John\r\nof Salisbury. To Bishop Maurice, who had baptized him, Philippe-Auguste\r\nleft the care of the Royal Treasury when he went on the Third Crusade.\r\nSo wisely did this churchman administer his revenues that he was able to\r\nbuild hospitals and abbeys, as well as erect, in larger part by his\r\npersonal donations, his own cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe first stone of Notre Dame was laid in 1163, and tradition says that\r\nAlexander III officiated in the same month that he dedicated for the\r\nBenedictines the new choir of St. Germain-des-Prés; the exiled pontiff\r\nresided in France for four years. Though the name of the architect of\r\nNotre Dame has not survived, his design was adhered to during a century\r\nand a half. A transept was not in his plan; however, a short one was\r\ninserted before the nave was laid down. That nave was nearly finished\r\nwhen Bishop Maurice de Sully died, in 1196, leaving large sums, in his\r\ntestament, for the completion of his beloved church. The two westernmost\r\nbays of the nave are not of the bishop-founder's time.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame, because of interruptions in its construction, presents an\r\nirregular alignment, and it is easy to perceive, as one gazes along its\r\nvaulting, that its choir slopes toward the north. Archæologists have\r\ngiven up the poetic explanation that the slanting choir was symbolic of\r\nthe droop of Christ's head on the cross. Nor can the symbol seeker now\r\ncall the Porte Rouge (an extra door in the north wall of the choir) a\r\nsouvenir of the spear wound of the Saviour, since if made with such\r\nintention it would have been placed below the extended arms of the\r\ntransept.\r\n\r\nThree campaigns of work built Notre Dame, and each time that the work\r\nwas resumed the axis deviated slightly. First rose the choir and a short\r\ntransept. Then was done the nave, save its westernmost bays. And\r\nfinally, at the beginning of the XIII century, they undertook the west\r\nfaçade and the two bays behind it. The carving on the pier's capitals\r\nshows the gradual advance in sculpture: in the choir they cut the large\r\nleaves of water plants which were the first nature models copied when\r\nthe conventional Byzantine models were discarded. Then, in the nave, the\r\nfoliage grew richer, and oak and vine and curled-up ferns appeared.\r\nCapital by capital should be studied, for their sculpture is masterly.\r\nThe capitals of the nave's triforium are said to mark the culmination of\r\nGothic art in foliate design. While unity was kept throughout the entire\r\narcade, there was unceasing variation in details.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Maurice de Sully, the peasant, died, he was succeeded by\r\nBishop Eudes de Sully, the feudal baron, descended from the reigning\r\ncounts of Champagne, from Louis VII and Aliénor of Aquitaine, and in\r\nwhose veins ran the blood of William the Conqueror through his daughter\r\nAdela. The ability to build was his by inheritance. He began the west\r\nfaçade, and probably at his death all three of the portals were in\r\nplace. To him we owe that fairest of sculptured entrances, the Virgin's\r\ndoor, under the northwest tower, called \"the most beautiful page of\r\nstone that the Middle Ages have left us.\" _Visibile palare_ are Dante's\r\nwords for such art as this. In the carved tympanum, \"Gothic art reached\r\nthe simple perfection of Phidias.\" The draperies flow easily; only in\r\nthe abrupt turning up of the edges of the robes lingers an archaic\r\ntouch. Below are represented kings and prophets, the ancestors of Mary.\r\nAbove them is a moving version of the Assumption; and in the upper\r\ntriangle is the Coronation of the Queen of Heaven by her Divine\r\nSon--she, the mortal, turned toward Him, the divinity, with a gesture of\r\nadoration. The Christ is the Nazarene, a noble Oriental.\r\n\r\nNo haziness then in their knowledge that the patroness in whose care\r\nthey placed their cathedrals was a fellow creature. To the common sense\r\nof the Middle Ages, it would have seemed a muddle-headed way of thinking\r\nto have called Jesus, God, and at the same time to have refused homage\r\nto His Mother, the one whom God chose to honor above all mortals, \"she\r\nwho didst so ennoble human nature that its own Maker scorned not to\r\nbecome its making.\"[81] It was only logical, they thought, that the best\r\nadvocate with the son should be the mother. \"All of us who fear the\r\nwrath of the Judge, fly to the Judge's mother,\" wrote Abélard. \"_Que\r\nDieu nous l'octroie par la prière de sa douce mère_,\" wrote the crusader\r\nJoinville. So, without worrying over future carpers who might murmur\r\n\"Mariolatry,\" the Middle Ages chanted \"_Laus Deo et Beatæ Mariæ\r\nlaudum_.\" And the cathedral of Paris dared to dedicate four of its six\r\ndoors to the Queen of Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe door under the southwest tower commemorates St. Anne, the Blessed\r\nVirgin's mother. It is a composite work, carved in Bishop Maurice's\r\ntime, between 1160 and 1170, but not set up here till Bishop Eudes de\r\nSully had undertaken the façade; in its tympanum are representations\r\nboth of Louis VII and of Maurice de Sully. St. Anne's door was a link\r\nbetween the still archaic western doors of Chartres and the clearly\r\nenunciated Gothic portal under the northwest tower of Paris Cathedral.\r\nIn the multitudinous folds of the draperies is Byzantine feeling, and\r\nsacerdotal is the Madonna who gravely presents her son to be adored. By\r\nthe middle of the XIII century, the Madonna had become a natural mother,\r\nand so she is sculptured at the north entrance to Notre Dame's transept.\r\n\r\nBishop Eudes de Sully, like his predecessor, had many a link with\r\nscholasticism and with other bishop-builders. He had been fellow\r\nstudent in Paris with the future Innocent III, and that expert in men\r\nwhen pope called on his aid to find capable occupants for the French\r\nsees. Eudes' own brother Henry was the archbishop of Bourges who\r\ninitiated the new cathedral there; and when his brother died, Eudes\r\nassisted in placing in his see the saintly Guillaume, who built the\r\nchevet of Bourges. Through Eudes de Sully, the bishop-builder of Rheims\r\nCathedral, Albéric de Humbert, was elected, and he also helped to elect\r\nBishop Hervé, who began the cathedral of Troyes. Able men ever found a\r\nprotector in the capable bishop of Paris, whose strict sense of duty was\r\nincorruptible. When Philippe-Auguste, his near kinsman, broke the\r\nmarriage law, Bishop Eudes went into exile rather than sanction the\r\nscandal. To him Innocent III sent St. Jean de Matha, that the prelate\r\nmight draw up a Rule for the new Order of Trinitarians, established to\r\nredeem captives from Islam. It was Eudes de Sully who founded, in 1204,\r\nthe abbey of Port Royal, a name to become of note in French letters.\r\n\r\nThe bishop of Paris from 1208 to 1219 was Pierre de Nemours, one of four\r\nbrothers who were bishop-builders, at Paris, at Noyon, at Châlons, and\r\nat Meaux. He died a crusader under the walls of Damietta. Scarcely a\r\ncathedral but has its crusade memory. The façade of Notre Dame had\r\nalmost reached the crowning open arcade when the scholarly Guillaume de\r\nSeignelay was transferred to the see of Paris from Auxerre where he had\r\nbegun the Gothic cathedral. The _galerie des rois_, whose date is about\r\n1223, was no doubt his work. Such galleries are found only in cathedrals\r\nin the royal domain, and it is just as likely that they honor the kings\r\nof France as the kings of Judea as some maintain. The majority of the\r\nlarger statues of Paris Cathedral are restitutions. Viollet-le-Duc had\r\nan English sculptor, George Frampton, make the gargoyles and grotesques\r\nof Notre Dame, since the Revolution wrecked most of the exterior\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nStill another noted scholastic, Guillaume d'Auvergne (1228-29), was to\r\nrule the see of Paris while its chief church was building. He finished\r\nthe northwest tower, which differed slightly in size and details from\r\nthat to the south; across the face of the former are ten statues,\r\nwhereas nine only are set before its companion tower. Perhaps a change\r\nof architects caused the disparity, or it may be that when the houses\r\nwere cleared away for the erection of the north tower, more space was\r\navailable. Bishop Guillaume d'Auvergne's writings show him to have been\r\none of the most original thinkers in the XIII century, a theologian, a\r\nphilosopher, a mathematician, and one versed in Arab and in Greek\r\nliterature. He became for St. Louis a kind of prime minister in\r\necclesiastical business, and, like the king, he founded hospitals and\r\nhouses of charity. There is a charming page in Joinville's reminiscences\r\nconcerning this able man. A priest expressed his doubts to him on the\r\nEucharist. Bishop Guillaume asked if he tried to resist the temptations,\r\nand he replied that he did so with all his force. \"Now I,\" said the good\r\nbishop, \"have not a single doubt about the Real Presence. I am like the\r\nfortress of Montleheri, safe in the heart of France, far from the danger\r\nline; but you, who fight unceasingly, are like the king's fortress of\r\nRochelle in Poitou, on the frontier. Now, of us two, whom will the king\r\nmost honor for guarding his fortresses?\"\r\n\r\nPeasant and prince, crusader and scholar, humanist and mathematician,\r\nmen of exemplary lives, born rulers and guides, such were the builders\r\nof Notre Dame of Paris, and their ability and sincerity live eternally\r\nin their work.[82] They gave free wing to the soul in raising their\r\ngreat church, while they cheerfully accepted the human law of working\r\nwithin limits. No cathedral in France shows more clearly the relation\r\nbetween builders and building, more clearly vindicates the ideals of its\r\nage. The partisan historian may cite his instances to prove that the\r\nreligion of that age was superstitious. While Notre Dame stands, such\r\ncharges are refuted. It is a historical document as potent for the\r\nvindication of the truth as the _Divina Commedia_ itself.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Guillaume d'Auvergne had finished the towers of Notre Dame\r\nhe caused to be made the open arcade from which they emerge, as from a\r\nroyal peristyle. About the same time side chapels were inserted between\r\nthe buttresses, and the line of small rose windows, which had hitherto\r\nmarked the triforium story, was done away with, in order that the\r\nclearstory windows might be lengthened. Only step by step were the\r\nbuilders learning that they might open the entire space between the\r\nactive members of a Gothic structure; the upper windows of Chartres had\r\npassed on the lesson to Paris.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the first architect was adhered to throughout, and since the\r\nlater masters-of-works were likewise natives of the Ile-de-France and\r\ninnate in them a classic restraint and a hardy daring (the hall-mark of\r\nthe best Parisian art to this day), the cathedral of Paris was\r\nhomogeneous. Midway in the XIII century Jean de Chelles, a precursor of\r\nRayonnant Gothic, lengthened the transept arms by a bay and finished\r\nthem with admirable façades. His name, and the date 1257, are cut on the\r\nfoundation stone of the south façade. The sculpture of that southern\r\nentrance honors St. Stephen, since on the site had once stood a church\r\ndedicated to the first martyr; the tympanum of the door is another\r\n_chef-d'oeuvre_ of Notre Dame. Jean de Chelles was the first to use\r\nperforated gables. It is thought that on the north façade worked Pierre\r\nde Montereau, the architect of St. Denis. As the XIII century merged in\r\nthe XIV Pierre de Chelles, probably a son of Jean, directed the making\r\nof the apse chapels and the superb flying buttresses which leap\r\nunhesitatingly over chapels and aisle and tribune gallery. He added the\r\nbig tribune windows with gables.\r\n\r\nThe classic restraint which is the leading quality of Notre Dame was\r\nnever poverty. Sculpture was lavish where it should be. At the portals\r\nthe Scriptures were set forth in detail and saints were held up for the\r\nedification of the people. The signs of the zodiac were carved, as well\r\nas the personification of the seasons and the months. Pinnacle and\r\nparapet were weighted with winged beast or demon, and the useful water\r\nspouts, or gargoyles, were chiseled as crabbed images. However, one\r\nshould always remember, in climbing the towers of Notre Dame, that most\r\nof the present stone monsters are modern, and it is one of the\r\nweaknesses of the restorer to overemphasize the grotesque in the art of\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nA strange world of fabulous creatures dwell on the roof of Our Lady's\r\nchurch--conceptions that are half terrible and half fantastic,\r\nimaginations that are survivals of the old pagan superstitions which\r\nChristianity could not wholly extirpate. The XII and XIII centuries were\r\nnot so far removed in time from the invasions of the northern\r\nBarbarians, and the Church made concessions to primitive inheritances.\r\nArtists were allowed to carve on roof or pinnacle the chimeras and\r\nvampires which through long centuries had haunted the imagination of\r\ntheir ancestors, provided that they expounded the truths of Christian\r\ndoctrine in such principal places as portals, façades, and choir\r\nscreens. Might not a mocking grotesque beside an angel be taken as\r\nemblem of the external antagonism of the animal and the spirit in man?\r\nThe choir screen of Notre Dame of Paris is sculptured with the\r\napparitions of the risen Lord, from Easter Day to the Ascension. \"If\r\nChrist be not risen again, then is our preaching vain.\"[83]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Paris during the first centuries of its existence was\r\nthe setting of many national scenes. Here the kings of France deposited\r\ntheir crown and renewed their vow to be just fathers of their people.\r\nBefore its altar their newborn heir was blessed. In 1182 the main altar\r\nof Notre Dame was consecrated, and three years later the patriarch of\r\nJerusalem preached from it the Third Crusade. On the eve of both his\r\ncrusades St. Louis prayed here, and in 1270, when his remains were\r\nbrought back from Tunis, they rested in Notre Dame for a solemn night of\r\nchanted mourning.\r\n\r\nIn Notre Dame the Duke of Bedford had his nephew, Henry VI of England,\r\ncrowned as king of France. Factional hate and a foreign enemy in control\r\ncaused a _Te Deum_ of rejoicing to be sung in this, the most national of\r\nFrench cathedrals, when the news came that Jeanne the Maid had been\r\ntaken prisoner before Compiègne, in 1429, but solemn reparation was made\r\nin 1456, when, in the presence of Jeanne's mother and brothers, the\r\nbishop of Paris (a Norman, and brother of the poet Alain Chartier)\r\nopened in Notre Dame the inquest that was to lead to the Rehabilitation\r\nof the heroine of Orleans.\r\n\r\nTo the hidden places over the vaults of Notre Dame fled the illustrious\r\nchancellor of Paris University, Gerson, to whom during two centuries was\r\nattributed the _Imitation of Christ_. In 1407 he had reprobated the\r\nmurder of the Duke of Orléans (builder of Pierrefonds) by the Duke of\r\nBurgundy (of the regal Dijon tomb), and the mob rose and sacked his\r\nhouse. It is said that for months Gerson lay concealed in Notre Dame,\r\nalone with his books, and given over to prayer and meditation.\r\n\r\nThe present stained glass in Notre Dame is modern, save for the north,\r\nsouth, and west rose windows, the trilogy of light usually found in big\r\ncathedrals. The roses of the transept belong to the Paris school which\r\nled in the art of glassmaking during the second half of the XIII\r\ncentury. So large were the spaces then to be filled that the scrupulous\r\npatience of the St. Denis craftsmen was no longer possible. Backgrounds\r\nhad to be made quickly by bold, simple trellis designs, and as the most\r\nfrequent background was a red trellis on a blue field, and the\r\njuxtaposition of red and blue makes violet, in too many of the windows\r\nof that period prevails a melancholy purplish hue. Originally the choir\r\nof Notre Dame boasted some glass given by Abbot Suger himself to the\r\npreceding Romanesque cathedral. In the XVIII century, those\r\nover-confident _gens de goût_, the cathedral canons, whose taste\r\nadmitted only the neo-classic, substituted uncolored glass for the\r\nancient windows. They say that when the workmen were removing Suger's\r\npriceless glass, they were dumfounded by its deep, ineffable blue.[84]\r\n\r\nMany a treasure of Notre Dame was destroyed by the Revolution, and the\r\nchurch itself was put up for sale and escaped demolition by merest\r\nchance. It served as Temple of Reason, as warehouse, as fête hall.\r\nAgain, during the Commune, in 1871, for the purpose of destroying it,\r\nchairs were piled high in the choir and set on fire, but brave men broke\r\nin the doors and extinguished the flames. Early in the World War, in\r\n1914, a German airship dropped a bomb on Notre Dame which pierced the\r\nroof of the transept's northern arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAINTE-CHAPELLE[85]\r\n\r\n    Li cuers doit estre semblans à l'encensier,\r\n    Tous clos envers la terre et overs vers le ciel.\r\n    --(Old song of the Middle Ages).\r\n\r\nOn the same isle in the Seine with Notre Dame stands the\r\nSainte-Chapelle, the reliquary of stone and jeweled glass which the\r\nsaint-king had made to enshrine the Crown of Thorns redeemed from\r\nConstantinople. To-day it is a body without a soul, as the revered crown\r\nis kept in the treasury of Notre Dame, and until a memorial service\r\nduring the World War, Mass had not been said in the _reliquaire de\r\nsouvenirs_ for fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe chapel, which was connected with the king's palace, was begun in\r\n1246 and dedicated in 1248. \"It was,\" said one who knew St. Louis well,\r\n\"the king's citadel against the adverses of the world.\" He would rise at\r\nmidnight to pass into the chapel for the singing of matins. \"Into this\r\nshrine Louis IX put all the memories of his crusading ancestors, all the\r\nhues of the Orient. It was his vision of the Heavenly Jerusalem.\" The\r\nwalls were rich with gold and color. The present polychromatic\r\ndecorations of the walls are a deplorable modern experiment. Fifteen\r\nsplendid windows told the Bible story in a thousand small medallions;\r\nninety-one scenes related Genesis; one hundred and twenty-one gave\r\nExodus. A window on the south side told the True Cross story, and the\r\nthree central windows were devoted to the lives of the Saviour and John\r\nthe Baptist. The western rose was added during the Flamboyant Gothic\r\nrevival following the expulsion of the English invaders.\r\n\r\nThe making of the vast windows of the Sainte-Chapelle raised Paris to\r\nthe leadership of the vitrine industry during the second half of the\r\nXIII century. Of that school are windows in the cathedrals of Angers and\r\nClermont, and Soissons' western rose. Though of splendid effect, such\r\nwindows do not equal those of the preceding hundred years, when Chartres\r\nand St. Denis led. The borders round each medallion had now become mere\r\nzigzags, since expedition was required for the glazing of enormous\r\nspaces.\r\n\r\nThe Sainte-Chapelle, as Gothic science, could be carried no farther\r\nwithout violating its own laws and becoming what an English critic said\r\nof the late-Gothic of France, \"all muscle and glass.\" Everywhere was the\r\nascending line accentuated; over the windows are some of the earliest\r\ngables extant. They break the horizontal band of the balustrade above,\r\nand serve structurally as weights on the longitudinal wall arches.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because the architect felt he was overemphasizing the\r\nascending line that he interrupted the soar of the columns marking the\r\nchapel walls, by placing against each shaft the amply draped statue of\r\nan apostle--the twelve pillars of the Church. To-day only the forth and\r\nfifth statues on the north side are originals; there are merely ancient\r\nfragments in the other images. For some time it was thought that the\r\nSainte-Chapelle was the work of Pierre de Montereau, the king's own\r\narchitect. A newly discovered record proves that he designed St. Denis'\r\nabbatial, which shows, however, no family likeness with the chapel of\r\nthe Cité palace. Now, that chapel does display a certain likeness to the\r\nfaçades of Notre Dame's transept, and it has been suggested that Jean de\r\nChelles, who designed the transept, was the architect of the\r\nSainte-Chapelle.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. JULIEN-LE-PAUVRE[86]\r\n\r\n    La France est l'homme,\r\n    Paris est le coeur.\r\n    --HENRY IV.\r\n\r\nClose to the Seine, under the hill of St. Geneviève, stands a small\r\ncontemporary of the choir of Notre Dame, St. Julien-le-Pauvre, built by\r\nthe Cistercians of Longpont, about 1180, and claiming as its patrons\r\nthree saints of the same name, St. Julian, martyr, St. Julian, bishop of\r\nLe Mans, and a humble St. Julian who had founded a hospice for pilgrims\r\nby the Seine and used to help the poor across the river. It is said that\r\na leper whom he was piloting over vanished in midstream, whereupon the\r\npeople said it had been the Lord himself come to test the holy man's\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nThe western bays of St. Julien-le-Pauvre have been demolished and all\r\nthat remains intact of the Primary Gothic church are the choir, with\r\nthree apsidal chapels, the side aisles' vaulting, and the columns\r\nagainst the side walls. The same sculptor who worked at Notre Dame made\r\nthe virile capitals of this little church.\r\n\r\nSt. Julien to-day is used by the Greek-Melchite rite of Roman Catholics.\r\nIt long was the patron church of letters and science, and every year\r\nfrom its altar started the procession of the University of Paris to the\r\nfair at St. Denis called Lendit, for the solemn purchase of a twelve\r\nmonths' supply of parchment. The rector of the university led the\r\nthrong, and so vast was the concourse of students that the head of the\r\nprocession was in St. Denis' abbatial before the rear ranks had quitted\r\nSt. Julien-le-Pauvre. For four hundred years Paris University elected\r\nits rector in this little church, and tradition says that Dante prayed\r\nhere when he crossed the Alps in 1304. In his imagination was then\r\nsurging his mighty poem, and the men of France have pictured him pausing\r\nto muse over the images of Hell at their own cathedral doors. The great\r\nexile of Florence was himself the purest product of scholasticism, as\r\nimpassioned as were the cathedral builders for theology and philosophy,\r\nfor symmetry and rhythm and the mysterious beauty of numbers. The\r\n_Divina Commedia_ was a poetic _Summa_.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GERMAIN-DES-PRÉS, ST. MARTIN-DES-CHAMPS, AND ST.\r\nPIERRE-DE-MONTMARTRE[87]\r\n\r\n     Ces vénérables bénédictines dont la science n'était égalée que par\r\n     leur modestie--F. BRUNETIÈRE.\r\n\r\nThere are in Paris three abbey churches that show steps in the\r\ntransition to Gothic art: St. Germain of the meadows, St. Martin in the\r\nfields, and St. Peter's church on the martyr's hill, names that keep\r\nalive early Christian traditions--the first bishop and martyr of Paris,\r\nSt. Peter whom always \"the eldest daughter of the Church\" was glad to\r\nhonor; St. Martin, first beloved of the apostles of Gaul, and Bishop\r\nGermain (d. 576) who founded outside the city walls the abbey called\r\nlater by his name, and who helped to Christianize the new Frankish\r\nconquerors. So disinterested was he that, to feed the poor, he sold a\r\nhorse given him by the king; whether riding or walking, the saint-bishop\r\never went in prayer.\r\n\r\nThe present church of St. Germain-des-Prés has a tower that in part\r\npredates the year 1000; it was erected by an abbot who ruled from 990 to\r\n1014, and shows the small stones used at that period. The nave and\r\ntransept, finished before the XI century closed, under a bishop of Paris\r\nwho was uncle of Godfrey de Bouillon, comprise the only remaining\r\nRomanesque work in the capital. Twice in the XII century the choir was\r\nreconstructed by the monks, first about 1125, and at the same time the\r\nancient tower's upper story was built; and again, after Suger, in 1144,\r\nhad demonstrated the superiority of Gothic vaulting. St. Germain's abbot\r\nwrote, in 1163, that he had repaired his church in a new fashion. In the\r\nambulatory the round and the pointed arch appeared side by side, and the\r\ngroin vault was used simultaneously with the diagonals. The capitals\r\nwere altogether Romanesque, since sculpture changed less swiftly than\r\nconstruction in those transitional years. Perhaps the new choir of St.\r\nGermain was not wholly finished when Pope Alexander III dedicated it in\r\n1163, the year that the foundation stone of Notre Dame was laid. The\r\nchoir's triforium arches were cut off, later, to lengthen the clearstory\r\nwindows, and the nave has been revaulted.\r\n\r\nIn the abbey inclosure a Sainte-Chapelle, a cloister, and a refectory\r\nwere built by Pierre de Montereau; he and his wife, Agnes, were buried\r\nin the chapel. Fragments of his work have been collected in the small\r\ngarden beneath the Carolingian tower of the abbatial, as well as in the\r\ngardens of the Musée Cluny.[88] The Revolution entirely wrecked the\r\nmonk's quarters.\r\n\r\nSt. Germain-des-Prés, in popular speech, was _The Abbey_. Here gathered\r\nthe learned men of Paris for mental stimulus. In its priceless library,\r\ndestroyed by the Revolution, worked those famous scholars Dom Luc\r\nd'Achery (d. 1685), Dom Mabillon (d. 1707), and Dom Rivet (d. 1749),\r\nwhose tireless patience and scrupulous respect for historical truth\r\nmade the name Benedictine a synonym for \"savant.\" Three monumental works\r\nwere begun by the XVII-century reformers who renewed the love of letters\r\nin the leading monastic houses of France: the _Acta Sanctorum_; the\r\nannals of the Benedictine Order; and that pride of French letters, the\r\n_Histoire Littéraire de la France_, which to-day the Institute of France\r\nis continuing. \"_Gros livres inutiles_,\" Voltaire glibly called the\r\ninvaluable books which for the modern school of mediæval archæology have\r\nmade flesh-and-blood men of the old prelate-builders of cathedrals.\r\n\r\nThe parts which have survived of that other notable Benedictine\r\nestablishment in Paris, St. Martin-des-Champs, are now comprised in the\r\n_Arts et Métiers_ establishment. Affiliated with great Cluny, St.\r\nMartin's priory was as like it, said Peter the Venerable, as seal is\r\nlike signet. To-day in the ancient church is installed an exhibit of\r\nmachinery. The beautiful hall, once the monks' refectory, and now a\r\ntechnical library, is thought to be the work of Pierre de Montereau. The\r\nslender pillars dividing it into two aisles, the well-carved capitals,\r\nthe elaborate keystones, and the portal's foliage all belong to the\r\ngolden hour of the national art.\r\n\r\nFor the student it is the choir of the church (c. 1135), built by the\r\nprior who surrounded the monastery lands with walls (1130-40), which is\r\nof chief interest, for in it were taken marked strides in the advance of\r\nGothic structure. Here first was attempted a double ambulatory, an idea\r\nwhich Suger within a few years was to carry out in its fulfillment at\r\nSt. Denis. The Lady chapel, a lobed half dome--the sacred\r\ntrefoil--developed further the ribbed apse first found at Bury (c.\r\n1125); here the ribs are structural, not merely decorative. Like other\r\nmonuments of the transitional hour, St. Martin used simultaneously\r\nintersecting ribs and groins, round and pointed arches. Its XIII-century\r\nnave was never vaulted.\r\n\r\nThe third monument of the capital which shows other stumbling first\r\nsteps of the national art is the little church of St. Pierre under the\r\ntowering new basilica of the Sacred Heart on Montmartre.[89] Till the\r\nXII century there stood on the site of St. Pierre a church dedicated to\r\nSt. Denis, for tradition said that the first martyr of Paris had here\r\nbeen interred until his relics were removed to the new abbey of St.\r\nDenis on the Roman road outside Paris. In the crypt, by St. Peter's, on\r\nMontmartre, it is said that the earliest Christians of the region held\r\ntheir rites. And to that hallowed spot has come many a soul to beseech\r\nenlightenment on the eve of some projected good work. Here, in 1534, St.\r\nIgnatius Loyola, St. Francis Xavier, and the first Jesuits passed a\r\nnight in prayer and vowed themselves to God's service. Here came St.\r\nFrancis de Sales before founding the Visitation Order, St. Vincent de\r\nPaul before founding the Lazarists, and M. Olier before he organized St.\r\nSulpice. Ursulines and Carmelites also have memories with St.\r\nPierre-de-Montmartre.\r\n\r\nA Benedictine priory was installed here by Louis VI and his queen,\r\nAdelaide, niece of Pope Calixtus II of the Capetian house of Burgundy.\r\nThey began the present church as Romanesque, but soon the new system of\r\nvaulting was employed. Slowly but consecutively throughout the XII\r\ncentury St. Peter's church was built. Its oldest Gothic vault is the one\r\nover the section of the choir preceding the apse; the stout ribs have\r\nprofiles like those which Abbot Suger was making about that same time in\r\nthe forechurch of his abbatial.\r\n\r\nThe solemn dedication of St. Pierre-de-Montmartre took place in 1147\r\nwith Pope Eugene III officiating and St. Bernard and Peter the Venerable\r\nacting as deacon and subdeacon. Since the rebuilding of the apse, at the\r\nend of the XII century, numerous reconstructions have gone on in order\r\nto preserve the revered church.[90]\r\n\r\n\r\nST. LOUIS AND JOINVILLE[91]\r\n\r\n    Je dis que droit est mort et loyauté éteinte\r\n    Quand le bon roi est mort, la créature sainte,\r\n    A qui se pourront désormais les pauvres gens clamer\r\n    Quand le bon roy est mort qui tant les sut aimer?\r\n    --REGRES DU ROY LOEYS.\r\n\r\nThe greatest glory of the Middle Ages was the saint-king himself. He was\r\nessentially of his epoch both in his love of theology and his enthusiasm\r\nfor building. Under his grandfather, Philippe-Auguste, most of the\r\nGothic cathedrals of France were begun. The majority of them continued\r\nbuilding under Louis IX. In his reign Beauvais Cathedral was started,\r\nthat of Meaux rebuilt, as was also St. Denis' cathedral-like abbatial.\r\nThere rose now a host of lesser Gothic edifices, such as the\r\nSainte-Chapelle at Paris, the synodal hall at Sens, and the hospital\r\nhall at Ourscamp. \"And as a writer who has made his book, illuminating\r\nit with gold and azure, so our king illuminated his kingdom with the\r\nbeautiful abbeys he built,\" wrote his friend Joinville.\r\n\r\nAll too many of his abbatials have been swept away--Royaumont,[92] built\r\nwith the proceeds from his father's jewels, where Louis IX had worked\r\nside by side with the masons, where he had passed his saddest hours, for\r\nin its church was laid to rest his promising eldest son, whose beautiful\r\ntomb now is harbored at St. Denis. Gone, too, is Maubuisson Abbey, where\r\nwas buried his mother, Blanche of Castile. Her bronze tomb was melted up\r\nand made into cannon during the Revolution, but one knows that the\r\nsomething high and Spanish in Blanche (whom her contemporaries compared\r\nto stag and eagle) would have preferred a cannon to the copper pennies\r\ninto which were transmuted all too many of the ancient tombs. The mother\r\nof St. Louis was a woman cast in a heroic mold, daughter of that Spanish\r\nking who at Las Navas de Toloso saved Europe from an avalanche of\r\n400,000 Mussulmans and granddaughter of art-loving Aliénor of Aquitaine\r\nand Henry II, Plantagenet.\r\n\r\nThe prudence of Blanche of Castile saved the kingdom for her son against\r\nthe insurgent barons of France. She hastened to have him crowned at\r\nRheims, in 1226, in the same year that St. Francis died, in Italy. It is\r\nsaid that the lad of twelve held up firmly the sword of the Emperor\r\nCharlemagne, whose blood ran in his veins. The barons tried to kidnap\r\nthe young king from his mother, and when he escaped the snare and rode\r\nback to Paris all the countryside poured out to bless him. Years later\r\nhe told Joinville it was from that hour he dedicated himself to the\r\nwelfare of his people.\r\n\r\nIn 1234, at twenty, he was married in Sens Cathedral to a princess of\r\nthe cultivated house of Provence; Dante has a line for the daughters of\r\nRaymond Berenger IV, patron of the troubadours: \"Four daughters had he\r\nand each a queen.\"[93] Marguerite of Provence was somewhat overridden by\r\nthe stronger personality of Blanche, her mother-in-law. For his valiant\r\nmother, Louis IX retained always a passionate admiration. On his first\r\ncrusade he left his kingdom in her charge, which, however, he did not do\r\nfor his queen, when he last went crusading. He had seen her sister, on\r\nthe throne of England, tamper with that country's interests for the\r\nadvancement of her own family, and he recognized in his Marguerite a\r\nstrain of the same intriguing. She could rise to her lord's level,\r\nhowever, and was his faithful lifelong companion. A sublime word of hers\r\nhas come down to us: they were sailing back to France after four years'\r\nsojourn in Palestine; off Cyprus the ship was well-nigh wrecked, and an\r\nattendant rushed to ask if he should awaken the royal children. \"No,\"\r\ncried the queen, \"let them go to God in their sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThat a king whose forebears had fought in all the crusades should, in\r\nhis turn, strike a blow for Christendom, was inevitable. Jerusalem had\r\nfallen in 1244, and the instinct of Europe felt the menace of the Mongol\r\nadvance from the East. Was not the fate of Spain close at hand to prove\r\nthe possibility of Oriental invasion? So St. Louis took the crusader's\r\nvow, and with him went the turbulent lords whose departure gave France\r\nsome needed years of peace. He had in vain tried to negotiate peace\r\nbetween Papacy and Empire, in whose protracted duel he remained neutral.\r\n\r\nIn Cyprus, in 1248, the crusaders paused before descending on Egypt, and\r\nthere St. Louis and Joinville drew together. The hereditary seneschal of\r\nChampagne was a very great lord, his mother being of Burgundy's Capetian\r\nline, and his Joinville forebears notable crusaders.[94] The contingent\r\nwhich he provided for the holy wars consisted of nine knights and seven\r\nhundred men, but because of the long winter's halt in Cyprus he found\r\nhimself in straits to meet their expenses. Louis IX, ten years his\r\nsenior, came to his aid, although the ruler of Champagne and not the\r\nking of France was Joinville's suzerain. Side by side the two friends\r\nwent through the disastrous campaign in Egypt--the delayed march on\r\nCairo, which ended in Mansourah's defeat. Together they shared\r\nimprisonment, and the king's elevation of soul won the Mussulmans'\r\nrespect. Then, their ransom paid, they sailed together for Palestine,\r\nand there, in the daily intimacy of years, the affection of these two\r\nloyal knights struck deep root. To Joinville the king intrusted his wife\r\nand children in the perilous overland journey in Syria, before they\r\nembarked for France.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1254, Louis IX came back from the East, he gave himself up for\r\nfifteen years to his country's welfare, \"the most conscientious man who\r\never sat on a throne,\" touched to the core by that divine unrest which\r\nis man's highest faculty and does lasting work for God, revered by the\r\n\"little people of the Lord\" as their champion for justice and social\r\nprogress. \"_Il est en doulce France un bon roy Loeys_,\" sang the\r\nminstrels then. Never did king love more _la doulce France_ and prove it\r\nmore conclusively. Justice was inherent in him. A most sensitive feeling\r\nof duty ruled his every act. Yet he knew how to mete out deserved\r\npunishment unflinchingly. From his shrewd and capable grandfather, so\r\nlittle of a saint, he had learned that no one could govern well who\r\ncould not refuse as well as grant.\r\n\r\nThat Louis IX understood his age is shown in his dealings with the\r\nfeudal system. He made no attempt to destroy it, which would then have\r\nbeen impossible, and, moreover, his respect for the rights of others\r\nalways kept him from extreme measures; but he regulated its excesses,\r\nknowing that organized anarchy could be broken only by organized laws.\r\nOne of the best laws he passed was that of the _quarantaine-le-roy_,\r\nwhich forbade any baron to wage war on his fellows without a notice of\r\nforty days. The king favored the written law to offset the law of\r\ncustom, on which feudal abuses were based. During a generation he had\r\nhis agents all over France collect old laws and customs--Roman law,\r\ncanon law, feudal privileges, and from their composite mass was created\r\nthe great code called the _Établissements de St. Louis_. He substituted\r\njurisprudence by inquest, and witnesses for that by force, and he made a\r\nsupreme court by instituting the right of appeal. Admirable were some of\r\nhis treaties such as that which made the Pyrenees the natural boundary\r\nbetween Spain and France. His reform of the coinage was another link of\r\nunity for France.\r\n\r\nIn Paris he organized a police, protected commerce by regulations, put\r\nan end to the selling of magistratures, and he began, there, the library\r\nwhich to-day is the richest in Europe. In the garden of the Cité and\r\nunder the oaks of Vincennes, the king held open courts of justice, and\r\nwhen his youngest brother, Charles d'Anjou,[95] tried to browbeat one of\r\nlesser rank, the king gave a legal councilor to the poor knight who won\r\nthe case against the prince. Louis IX's very enemies chose him as\r\narbiter. Little wonder that the people of France have sung of him:\r\n\r\n    Ha! le bon Roy!\r\n    Simples, ignorans supportait\r\n    Pauvres, mendians confortait,\r\n    Observant de Jhusys la foi,\r\n    Redoutant Dieu--\r\n                Ha! le bon Roy!\r\n\r\nJoinville has drawn for all time the picture of the years between the\r\nsaint-king's two crusades, a golden age, if ever there was one. The\r\nfriendship begun during their years of Syrian comradeship continued, and\r\nthe seneschal often came up to Paris. It was he who arranged the\r\nmarriage of the king's daughter with his own suzerain, the son of\r\nThibaut IV, the song maker, in whose court of Champagne Joinville had\r\nacquired his delightful mode of speech.\r\n\r\nThen, again, came the call of the East. Jaffa and Antioch had fallen to\r\nIslam, and the condition of the Oriental Christians was heartrending.\r\nLouis IX could not resist their cry for aid. In 1270, twenty-two years\r\nafter his first departure from Aigues-Mortes, the king sailed again from\r\nthat half-finished fort by the dead waters. Joinville was not with him,\r\nfor he was needed by his \"little people,\" an excuse which his friend\r\nacknowledged.\r\n\r\nThe crusaders had scarcely landed on the coast of Africa when plague\r\nstruck them down. First died Tristan, the son born to St. Louis in the\r\nsorrowful, earlier days in Egypt. Then the saint-king himself passed\r\naway; and on his lips was the prayer that his race might learn to\r\ndespise the prosperity of this world and not to fear adversity, and that\r\nFrance might never deny the name of Christ. The night before he died\r\nthey heard him singing, \"_Nous irons en Jerusalem_,\" the holy city he\r\nhad never seen, the aspiration, the magic name that stirred those strong\r\ngenerations.[96] Before the century closed the Church canonized him.\r\n\"House of France,\" announced the pope, \"rejoice to have given the world\r\nso great a prince, and to heaven so great a saint. People of France,\r\nrejoice to have had so great a king.\"\r\n\r\n\"If ever the golden age of the good old times existed,\" wrote\r\nSainte-Beuve, \"it certainly was under St. Louis, and it is by the pen of\r\nJoinville that it exists for us. They believed then in their king, they\r\nbelieved above all in their God, as if God were present in the smallest\r\noccurrences of daily life.\" In the _Histoire de St. Louis_ by Jean, sire\r\nde Joinville, there is not a mawkish note, and considering what happens\r\nto too many saints in their biographies, it must be acknowledged that\r\nthe seneschal accomplished a feat. As depicted by his contemporaries,\r\nLouis IX is so convincingly himself that later efforts to stereotype him\r\nas the sacristan's ideal of piety have failed. His \"pleasant manner of\r\nspeech seasoned with wit\" had nothing of the prig in it. From his\r\nchildhood to his deathbed of ashes in ancient Carthage (birthplace of\r\nhis favorite Augustine), St. Louis possessed a direct personal touch\r\nwith God. \"_Beau Sire Dieu, garde-moi mes gens!_\" he rose at night to\r\npetition with insistent outstretched arms when, in Egypt, the \"Greek\r\nfire\" was hurled into the Christian camp. And Joinville, who had a\r\nwholesome dread of the Saracens' projectiles, turned to rest, feeling\r\nsecure while such prayers were beseeching Heaven.\r\n\r\nLouis IX was a tireless student of the Bible and works of the Church\r\nFathers. He had a passion for the liturgy. The number of hours which he\r\nspent in prayer has roused the sarcasm of our indifferent generation.\r\nHis hours before the Tabernacle bore fruit in deeds. His temper was\r\nnaturally quick, and he had a keen sense of irony, but his friend, the\r\nseneschal, was able to bear witness, at his canonization process, that\r\nin an intimacy of over twenty years never had he heard a word of\r\ndisparagement of others fall from the king's lips. \"There was something\r\nin the mere sight of him that found a way to the heart and affections,\"\r\nwrote one who knew him; \"the eyes of a dove,\" said another. \"He seemed\r\npierced to the heart with pity for the unfortunate,\" wrote Queen\r\nMarguerite's chaplain who had daily intercourse with him. An observant\r\nItalian who saw the king on his way to his first crusade described the\r\nsomething of rare refinement and grace in his bearing.\r\n\r\nNot a touch of self-consciousness was in Louis; barefooted, in a white\r\ntunic, he carried the Crown of Thorns through the streets of Paris. In\r\nhis sublime other-worldliness, he bathed the feet of beggars, dressed\r\nthe sores of lepers, and when he felt that his soul needed it he\r\nscourged himself. And at the same time he was a model of knightly\r\nprowess, who many a time had fought\r\n\r\n    For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,\r\n    Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross\r\n    Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens.[97]\r\n\r\nAt the battle of Mansourah, Joinville saw the king, \"the most beautiful\r\nof men,\" to his eyes, fair, gallant, in stature head and shoulders above\r\nthose around him, defend himself alone with great slashing sword cuts\r\nfrom the onslaught of six paynims. He was a true _prud'homme_, a name\r\nfor which he had a weakness, for to be a _prud'homme_ meant to be a\r\nknight, not only bodily, but in one's soul.\r\n\r\nSide by side with his other-worldliness went a sound practical sense.\r\nWhen his son-in-law, Thibaut V of Champagne, gave overgenerously to a\r\nmonastery in Provins, all the while that he was in debt, St. Louis asked\r\nhim was it fair to bestow alms with other people's money. His personal\r\ntastes were unostentatious, but he held court sumptuously when the\r\noccasion required, and he advised his lords to dress well so that their\r\nwives would love them better. He was ever human; when word came to him\r\nin Palestine that the mother he adored had died in France, he shut\r\nhimself away from sympathy for two days, then sent for the friend he\r\nloved best. As Joinville approached, the king opened his arms to him\r\nwith the cry, \"Ah, seneschal, I have lost my mother!\"\r\n\r\nJoinville has recounted a scene which took place between him and his\r\nfriend, that is one of the fairest things in literature, slight episode\r\nthough it is. In council, in Palestine, the barons urged the king to\r\nreturn to France. Almost alone, Joinville held out against such a course\r\nwhile their retainers were still unredeemed from captivity. For he\r\nremembered how a knight of his family had admonished him: \"You are going\r\nbeyond the seas. Be careful how you come back. For no knight, rich or\r\npoor, can return an honored man if he leaves in Saracen hands the humble\r\nfolk of Our Lord with whom he started forth.\"\r\n\r\nThe king listened in silence at the council, and in silence sat through\r\nthe banquet that followed, paying no heed to Joinville, who was placed\r\nby his side. The seneschal, saddened by what he thought to be his\r\nfriend's displeasure, was standing alone, leaning against a casement,\r\nthinking that when the others returned to France, he would join the\r\nPrince of Antioch, his cousin, till another crusade came to deliver the\r\n\"little people of the Lord\" unransomed still in Egypt. As he leaned\r\nagainst the window bars he felt friendly arms laid about his shoulders:\r\n\"Have done, Monseigneur,\" he cried, thinking it was one of the barons\r\ncome to mock him, \"leave me in peace.\" Then the loving hands slipped\r\nover his face and he recognized the emerald ring worn by the king. The\r\ndear words of mock reproach: \"What you, the youngest, dare advise me\r\nagainst all the great and the wise men of France? Tell me, you think I\r\nwould do wrong in leaving?\" Then sturdy Joinville, who paints his\r\nfriend, too, by the confession, \"Never did I lie to him,\" made answer,\r\n\"Yes, Sire, as God is my aid.\" \"And if I stay, will you stay?\" asked the\r\nking.\r\n\r\nThe bloom of the exquisite moment has come to us across the dividing\r\ncenturies because Joinville was not thinking of making a book when he\r\nwrote his reminiscences. His object was to have others understand the\r\ngracious distinction, the tender familiarity with him of this\r\nking-crusader whom he loved and who loved him. Written artlessly, and in\r\nentire good faith, his book is full of that indefinable quality called\r\ncharm. The seneschal's honest heart is in its infinitely precious pages.\r\n\r\nIn that other early monument of French prose, the grave Villehardouin\r\nrises to the historian's plane in depicting the Fourth Crusade.\r\nJoinville cannot be said to have taken in the Sixth Crusade as a whole;\r\nhe muddles the battle scenes; he digresses to right and to left in idle\r\ndetails, then catches himself up with happy ease, as if saying, \"Dear\r\nme! I forgot to mention,\" imparting to his chronicle an inimitable\r\nquality all its own. No one would have Joinville different. Amiable,\r\njocund, unaffected, the soul of honor, candor itself, he does not fear\r\nto acknowledge that he could tremble with fright in battle despite his\r\nstalwart six feet and over. He beguiled his captivity by trying to\r\nconvert a Mohammedan by highly colored descriptions of hell. He whiled\r\naway the long hours in Syria in composing a treatise of theology, a\r\n_Credo_, wherein he warns every _prud'homme_ to hold on to God with both\r\narms lest that felon, the devil, come between. And the two arms by which\r\na man was to hold on to God were Faith and Good Works. \"You must have\r\nboth, if you wish to keep God: one without the other is worthless,\"\r\nwarns the young seneschal. No quibbling then!\r\n\r\nJoinville had also that quality which the French term _enjouement_, hard\r\nto translate, a playful, most lovable frankness, a mocking vivacity\r\nwhich was for St. Louis a source of relaxation. The king loved\r\nconversation; he thought there was no book so good as _quolibet_, or say\r\nwhat you please. Some Armenian pilgrims besought of the seneschal a\r\nglimpse of the saint-king. Joinville came merrily to tell his friend,\r\nwarning him that he, the seneschal, was not yet prepared to kiss his\r\nbones. And the king laughed, too, but because he knew it would give the\r\ndevout Armenians pleasure, he accorded them an interview. Stroke by\r\nstroke, Joinville filled in the picture of Louis IX, and all the while\r\nhe unconsciously paints himself as well. He is so eager to make you love\r\nhis hero that you learn to love himself. A tear is always close to the\r\neye in reading Joinville, not that what he relates is sad, but because\r\nthis story of a high soul, written by his loyal friend, touches things\r\nthat lie deep in all true hearts.\r\n\r\nJoinville was to survive his friend for half a century. He died in 1317.\r\nWith a character ripened by six years of intimacy with the _bon\r\nsaint-homme roy_, he came back from the East and set himself to work for\r\nhis people's welfare, the \"little people of the Lord\" by whom he had\r\nstood in their hour of need. He was then but thirty. In his old age he\r\nwas the accepted arbiter of good taste, admired as the last of a\r\ngeneration of courtesy. When over ninety, this vigorous old crusader\r\nrode into Flanders on a military expedition for the crown. He had seen\r\nthe reigns of six French kings and the passing away of the crusader's\r\nspirit. He had seen his own Champagne become a part of the royal domain,\r\nwhen the heiress Jeanne was married to the grandson of St. Louis. And it\r\nwas at the bidding of that queen of Philippe-le-Bel that Joinville wrote\r\ndown his memories of Louis IX.\r\n\r\nFrance has high advocates to plead for her before the Throne in hours of\r\nnational peril. Jeanne d'Arc said that she saw St. Louis petitioning God\r\nin the dire hour of foreign invasion. \"May they never deny Thy name,\"\r\nprayed the saint-king at Tunis, as he rendered \"his pure soul unto his\r\ncaptain, Christ, under whose colors he had fought so long.\" And in the\r\nmen of 1914-18, true _prud'hommes_ after the heart of St. Louis and his\r\ndear friend Joinville, stirred the crusader blood of their ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLLEGIATE OF MANTES[98]\r\n\r\n     The king was very well built, of easy bearing and smiling\r\n     countenance, bald, high-colored, a great eater and drinker. Toward\r\n     his friends he was most generous; toward those who displeased him\r\n     he was very firm; in his designs he was foresighted and tenacious,\r\n     very catholic in his beliefs, and he judged rapidly and with great\r\n     perspicacity. Easy to arouse, he was also easy to appease. Upon the\r\n     great who disobeyed him he was hard, and he enjoyed sowing\r\n     discord among them, and to make use of the little people in his\r\n     purposes.--Portrait of Philippe-Auguste by a canon of St. Martin,\r\n     Tours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Notre Dame of Mantes (1160-1200). The Contemporary of\r\nParis Cathedral_]\r\n\r\nFrom Paris can best be visited the cathedral-like collegiate at Mantes\r\non the Seine to the east, and the cathedral of Meaux on the Marne to the\r\nwest. Mantes-la-Jolie, the \"well-beloved\" city of Philippe-Auguste, and\r\nwhere he died in 1223, is set picturesquely above the Seine, in whose\r\nwidened course are wooded islands. From the bridge crossing the\r\nriver[99] may be had the best view of the town. The collegiate church of\r\nNotre Dame stands above the houses of the pleasant little city, in the\r\nhigh-shouldered way of many a French church. Happily, it has never been\r\nreconstructed. It has various traits in common with Notre Dame of Paris,\r\nand some think that the same architect planned both.\r\n\r\nMantes' Primary Gothic church was begun about 1160, at the same time as\r\nthe cathedral in the capital, but, being on a lesser scale, it was\r\nfinished sooner, and thus appears more archaic. Normandy's Romanesque\r\nzigzag ornamentation was still retained, and the cells of certain vault\r\nsections show the hesitating rough work of masons as yet unpracticed.\r\nWhile the transverse arches are pointed, those of the diagonal-crossing\r\nribs are round. Too wide an expanse of plain wall space was left between\r\ntribune and clearstory, for it was to take half a century longer before\r\narchitects dared fill their entire upper wall with windows. Like Notre\r\nDame of Paris, the tribunes open on the middle church by wide, graceful\r\narches. And this smaller Notre Dame also has western towers that are\r\nconnected by an open colonnade. The collegiate has no transept, and one\r\nrecalls that neither had Paris Cathedral in its first plan. The flying\r\nbuttresses here are among the first ever made. A striking feature of the\r\nexterior of the church is the row of little oculi that light the\r\ntribunes over the aisles, some of which have been changed to windows of\r\nRayonnant tracery. The deep galleries once were entirely vaulted by\r\ntransverse half cradles borne on low lintels, an experiment in masonry\r\nroofing first tried at Tournus, but which never became popular; at Caen\r\nthe tribunes of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes had been vaulted by similar half\r\ncylinders whose axial lines were at right angles to that of the nave.\r\n\r\nThe first Gothic rose window of big dimensions adorns the west façade of\r\nMantes collegiate. It is what they call plate tracery--that is, the\r\npattern is formed of voids, the window being a group of variously shaped\r\nopenings, and not, as in bar tracery, a single opening with the pattern\r\nmade by solids, or stone mullions. The western rose at Laon stands\r\nhalfway between plate and bar tracery. Mantes' rose was the prototype\r\nfor that at Chartres.\r\n\r\nLike most of the larger XII-century churches, the sexpartite system of\r\nvaulting was used. Mantes also followed Noyon and Senlis in having\r\nalternating piers and, like Noyon, it showed the Rhenish trait of a\r\nwestern transept, formed by the two lower stories of the towers and the\r\nwesternmost bay of the middle vessel. Two of the portals are of the XII\r\ncentury, but the largest--the one under the south tower--was made by\r\nRaymond du Temple. And probably that same XIV-century architect of\r\nCharles V added the gracious chapel of Navarre which is among the best\r\nworks of Rayonnant Gothic. In it are four charming statuettes of the\r\ndonors, the princesses of Navarre, portrait work showing personal\r\nmannerisms. When the sister of the art-loving Valois king, Charles V,\r\nmarried Charles the Wicked (a scion of Capetian stock who was count in\r\nÉvreux and king in Navarre) she brought the town of Mantes in her dowry,\r\nand it was probably her daughters who are sculptured in this chapel of\r\nNavarre--their gift to Mantes collegiate.\r\n\r\nOn the site of the present church once stood a Romanesque edifice built\r\nby funds donated by William the Conqueror on his deathbed, to atone for\r\nhis having set fire to the ancient church (1087). Angered by a coarse\r\njoke of the French king's, he had sworn his usual oath, \"by the splendor\r\nand resurrection of God,\" that he would light a hundred thousand candles\r\nwhen he went to his churching Mass; so he marched against his tormentor\r\nand set fire to Mantes that lay in his path. For, as Mr. Henry Adams has\r\npicturesquely expressed it, \"Mantes barred the path of Norman conquest\r\nin arms, as in architecture.\" As the corpulent Conqueror rode around the\r\nplace, his horse stumbled, and from the injury then received he died in\r\nRouen in a few weeks. That burning of Mantes by the Duke of Normandy and\r\nKing of England has been called the prelude to the Hundred Years' War\r\nbetween France and England, whose actual span was from 1337 to 1453. And\r\nin a way Waterloo was its epilogue. The shoulder-to-shoulder fight of\r\nthe ancient rivals, from 1914 to 1918, let us hope, has put the seal on\r\ntheir pact of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF MEAUX[100]\r\n\r\n    Ah, see the fair chivalry come, the companions of Christ!\r\n      White Horsemen who ride on white horses, the Knights of God!\r\n    They, for their Lord and their Lover have sacrificed\r\n      All, save the sweetness of treading where He first trod!\r\n    These through the darkness of death, the dominion of night,\r\n      Swept, and they wake in white places at morningtide....\r\n    Now, whithersoever He goeth, with Him they go;\r\n      White Horsemen who ride on white horses, oh, fair to see!\r\n    They ride, where the Rivers of Paradise flash and flow,\r\n      White Horsemen, with Christ their Captain: forever He!\r\n    --LIONEL JOHNSON, _Te Martyrum Candidatus_.[101]\r\n\r\nTo decipher Meaux Cathedral has been a student's _tour-de-force_, so\r\nearly and unceasing have been its rebuildings.

Begun\r\nwith the choir, in the last decades of the XII century, it still\r\nretained the Romanesque idea of deep galleries over the side aisles.\r\nWhether poor foundations were laid or whether the tribune vaults were\r\nmade too cumbersome, the edifice gave signals of insecurity from the\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nAs the XIII century opened, the transept and that part of the nave near\r\nit were building with the tribunes still, although by that time such\r\ngalleries had fallen into disuse. Repeated restorations delayed the\r\nworks. Cracks continued to show until, about 1270, when the collapse of\r\nthe whole church was threatened, a complete reconstruction was\r\nundertaken by Bishop Jean de Poincy.\r\n\r\nAlready, in 1220, the choir had been redone and two more chapels added,\r\nmaking five apsidioles in all. In 1270 they demolished throughout the\r\nchurch the tribunes over the side aisles, and thus the aisles became\r\ntwice their intended height. In the first three bays of the choir were\r\nretained the arches of the tribune, so that now certain bays of the\r\nchoir aisles open on the central vessel by pier arcades surmounted by\r\nfalse-tribune arches. Striking effect is made in the nave by some giant\r\ncylinder piers whose height is double what was originally planned and\r\nwhose capitals are gems of interpretative sculpture, vine leaf and fern.\r\nMuch mechanical dexterity was shown in the recutting of piers and the\r\nelimination of the tribunes, but even now a few of the shorter columns\r\nare to be found embedded in the newer parts, and a few sections of the\r\ntriforium show their primitive plan.\r\n\r\nBy the time Meaux Cathedral was completed it was practically an edifice\r\nof the end of the XIII century. Its chief patroness was the queen of\r\nPhilippe-le-Bel (St. Louis' grandson), the Jeanne of Champagne who\r\nbrought that rich province to the Crown, as well as the kingdom of\r\nNavarre, the same princess who encouraged Joinville to write his\r\nreminiscences. The city of Meaux was in her dowry, and they say that her\r\nportrait was carved on a keystone of the choir. When she died, in 1305,\r\nshe named the bishop of Meaux as her executor and donated a legacy to\r\nhis church.\r\n\r\nA well-known XIV-century architect, Nicolas de Chaumes, worked on the\r\nwest façade, two of whose portals are of that period, and one of the XV\r\ncentury. Unfortunately, use was made of a soft stone which time has\r\nsadly eroded. Flamboyant Gothic sculpture, with foliage in gracious\r\ndisorder, appears in the western bays: the undulating flora of the XIV\r\ncentury, and the nervous, deeply indented, pointed leaves of the XV\r\ncentury when such complicated forms as the curly cabbage were taken as\r\nmodels. Wiser were the earlier sculptors who had interpreted and\r\narranged their leaves with architectural fitness. The south portal of\r\nMeaux's transept must have had in mind St. Stephen's door of the\r\ncathedral at Paris. At Meaux the sculptured figures show certain\r\nmannerisms, such as the throwing out of one hip, a trait soon to be\r\nexaggerated. The carvings throughout the church were mutilated by the\r\nHuguenots in 1562, and from that date no further work was done on the\r\nedifice. One tower of the façade remains painfully stunted.\r\n\r\nThe church of Meaux would stand well in the front rank of Gothic\r\ncathedrals were it not for certain flaws of proportion. Such\r\nexceptionally high side aisles call for a nave twice as long, and the\r\nclearstory appears dwarfed by the lofty pier arcades of the chevet. Yet\r\nthough made piecemeal, and without uniformity of style in its main\r\nparts, Meaux possesses a unity of its own, and its effect as a whole is\r\none of elegance and even radiance.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of its greatest bishop is an immense slab of marble in the\r\npavement of the choir. Bossuet devoted himself to his diocese for over\r\ntwenty years (1681-1704). Frequently he preached in the cathedral built\r\nby the generosity of Jeanne of Champagne, the founder of the College of\r\nNavarre, where he had studied in his youth. There is something akin in\r\nMeaux Cathedral to the high soul and courtliness of Bossuet. The two\r\nmost religious and national epochs in French history were the XIII and\r\nXVII centuries.\r\n\r\nFew churches in France present a better setting for a festival of\r\nsolemn joy than the cathedral of Meaux. It is the church for _Noël_, for\r\nthe white radiance of First Communion gatherings, for the _Te Deum_ of\r\nvictory. Fitting is it that the victory of the Marne should here have\r\nbecome a personal heritage. At the very gates of Meaux came the turning\r\nof the tide on September 5, 1914, when the thunderous advance on Paris\r\nwas suddenly arrested. The password for that day of miracle was \"Jeanne\r\nd'Arc.\" Near by, on the Oureq, Jeanne's troubadour, Péguy,[102] fell on\r\nthat same September 5th, he who had chanted prophetically:\r\n\r\n    _Heureux ceux qui sont mort pour une juste guerre ..._\r\n    _Heureux les épis murs et les blés moissonnés,_\r\n    _Heureux ceux qui sont mort dans les grandes batailles,_\r\n    _Couchés dessus le sol à la face de Dieu._\r\n\r\nClose to Meaux the battle raged outside, and the wounded, in bewildering\r\nnumbers, were carried into the desolated town which lacked a civic head.\r\nThe bishop of Meaux, Monseigneur Marbeau, stepped forth as the accepted\r\nleader, as in the time of those earlier invasions when the bishops of\r\nGaul saved Latin civilization.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1918, the invader drew perilously near, and a second victory\r\nof the Marne swept back the avalanche. From the fields around the city\r\nforever will an invisible white army of martyrs swell this cathedral's\r\n_Te Deum_. In Meaux on the Marne, God will always be the omnipotent Lord\r\nGod of Battles, the _Dominus Deus Sabaoth_ of the great hymn of\r\nthanksgiving.[103]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Cathedral of Meaux, Viewed from the Nave's Aisle_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEra of the Great Cathedrals, Chartres, Rheims, Amiens\r\n\r\n    _I stood before the triple northern porch_\r\n    _Where dedicated shapes of saints and kings,_\r\n    _Stern faces bleared with immemorial watch,_\r\n    _Looked down benignly grave, and seemed to say:_\r\n    _\"Ye come and go incessant, we remain_\r\n    _Safe in the hallowed quiets of the past._\r\n    _Be reverent, ye who flit and are forgot_\r\n    _Of faith so nobly realized as this.\"_\r\n     --JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL, _The Cathedral_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the four master cathedrals of France, that of Paris was begun first.\r\nThirty years later, in 1194, the cornerstone of Chartres was laid, that\r\nof Rheims in 1211, and that of Amiens in 1220. In the case of Chartres,\r\nRheims, and Amiens, rebuilding was undertaken when fire had destroyed\r\ntheir Romanesque cathedrals. All four of these great churches have the\r\nsame patroness, Our Lady, \"the glorious mother of God, our advocate\r\nagainst our enemy of hell\"--thus those generations spoke of her of whom\r\nDante chanted: \"Lady, thou art so great, and hast such worth that if\r\nthere be who would have grace, yet betaketh not himself to thee, his\r\nlonging seeketh to fly without wings.\"[104]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for many a modern mind to understand the passion of\r\nspiritual chivalry felt by the generations that built cathedrals for her\r\nwhom they called their sovereign lady, but unless some comprehension of\r\nthat mystic ideal is grasped no complete sympathy for mediæval art is\r\npossible. Mr. George Santayana, who would renew our sense of the moral\r\nidentity of all the ages, may see in the mediæval devotion to Our Lady a\r\ndevelopment of Platonic love, which he calls the transformation of the\r\nlove of beauty into the worship of an ideal beauty, the transformation\r\nof the love of a creature into the love of God. All love is to lead to\r\nGod. All true beauty leads to the idea of perfection, said Michael\r\nAngelo, who practiced Platonism, even as had Dante, who was of the very\r\nessence of the great scholastic century that built Chartres, Rheims, and\r\nAmiens.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF CHARTRES[105]\r\n\r\n     Discipline is indispensable to art.--GEORGE SANTAYANA.[106]\r\n\r\nChartres was Our Lady's shrine in a peculiar way, her \"special chamber.\"\r\nA local tradition, so old that it reached back to the dimmest past, told\r\nof a prophecy concerning a virgin mother, pronounced by the Druids, a\r\nhundred years before the Christian era on the site where Chartres now\r\nstands, and in the cathedral first built on the revered spot the bishop\r\nretained a pagan well which from time immemorial had been honored by the\r\npopulace. That Puits des Saints-Forts has been included in the crypt of\r\neach succeeding cathedral of Chartres. Finally some priggish\r\nXVII-century prelates looked with disfavor on the policy, advocated by\r\nthe apostle of the gentiles, to make use of the ancient superstition for\r\nthe spread of the true faith. So the pagan well was filled in, and trace\r\nof it was lost till M. René Merlet discovered it in 1900 and had it\r\nexcavated.\r\n\r\nThat Chartres was a meeting place of the Druids, we know from Cæsar, and\r\nthe XIII-century sons of the Gauls, as if in souvenir, carved the\r\ndruidical oak leaf freely upon the present cathedral. Is it fanciful to\r\nfeel that in the grave forest stillness of Chartres' interior lingers\r\nmuch of the theocratic nostalgia that forever haunts the Celt? In\r\ndruidic times priest, teacher, and lawmaker were honored above brute\r\nforce of arms. The present crypt of Chartres includes part of the\r\nGallo-Roman walls. The V-century Merovingian cathedral abutted on the\r\ncity ramparts. Then came wars which in part demolished the town walls,\r\nso that the reconstructed church was able to extend itself beyond the\r\nramparts. It was doubtless after the Norman inroads that was built, in\r\nthe IX century, the chapel of St. Lupus which forms the core of the\r\npresent crypt. The Carolingian cathedral of Chartres was destroyed by a\r\nterrible fire in 1020.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1020, the see of Chartres was occupied by one of the notable\r\nbishops of French history, Fulbert (1007-29), revered of the people, a\r\nscholar enamored of the life of study, though the events of that\r\nagitated age forced him to play an active part in the national life.\r\nLike Abbot Suger, he was of lowly extraction. He had studied in the\r\ncathedral school of Rheims, made notable by Archbishop Gerbert, who\r\nlater became Sylvester II, the pope of the year 1000. Fulbert, too, like\r\nhis master, was a versatile genius--doctor in medicine as well as\r\ntheologian, and one of the first to take up the new musical system of\r\nthe Benedictine Guy d'Arezzo. He made the cathedral school of Chartres a\r\ncenter of learning, and men who were to be the leaders of the age were\r\nhis pupils. Like Socrates, he taught his disciples as they paced up and\r\ndown the cathedral precincts. In his exhortations there was an\r\nappealing tenderness that had a singular power in moving men's hearts,\r\nand letters from his pupils still exist, complaining of the exile they\r\nfelt when separated from him.[107]\r\n\r\nTo rebuild his cathedral, Bishop Fulbert gave up his own revenues. Gifts\r\npoured in from the kings of England and Denmark, from the bishop's\r\nschoolmate of Rheims, the good and cultivated King Robert of France,\r\nfrom the Duke of Aquitaine, who donated the treasure accumulated in St.\r\nHilary's abbatial at Poitiers. The work was pushed forward with such\r\nenergy that after four years Bishop Fulbert was able to write that, by\r\nwinter, his lower church would be vaulted.\r\n\r\nThe present magnificent crypt under Chartres Cathedral is the very one\r\nbuilt by St. Fulbert. It is the most extensive crypt in France. Its\r\nsoundly constructed groin vaults stood firm when, two hundred years\r\nlater, the upper church was destroyed by fire. In times of public\r\ncalamity the people have fled to Fulbert's subterranean passages, and\r\nthe devotion of generations has hallowed his shrine. If you would know\r\nthe soul of this mystic cathedral, gather at dawn with the silent\r\nworshipers who choose that hour to kneel daily in the secluded intimacy\r\nof Notre-Dame-sous-Terre. The true hour for Chartres is not at noontime,\r\nwhen the tourists flock to the empty church, but in the morning with the\r\ndawn.[108]\r\n\r\nFulbert's Romanesque cathedral was finished in the same XI century by\r\nSt. Ives of Chartres, another born leader of the nation, who righted\r\nmany abuses. He dared stand up against Philip I himself, because of the\r\nking's adulterous marriage with the beautiful Bertrada de Montfort,\r\nstolen from the Count of Anjou. The bishop wrote thus to the king,\r\nrefusing to attend his wedding, \"out of respect for my own conscience,\r\nwhich I wish to keep pure before God, and because I would retain the\r\ngood repute by which a priest of Christ should honor himself before the\r\nfaithful. I would rather be flung into the bottom of the sea, with a\r\nmillstone round my neck, than be a stumbling block to the weak. Nor do I\r\nfail in the fidelity I owe you, in speaking thus to you, but rather I\r\ngive you proof of it, for I believe that you are risking your immortal\r\nsoul and are putting your crown in jeopardy.\" The king's answer was to\r\nthrow him into prison and to pillage his church.\r\n\r\nBishop Ives, in 1095, attended the preaching of the First Crusade at\r\nClermont, after which he accompanied Urban II to the Council of Tours.\r\nScarcely a big event of his day or a leading personage that he was\r\nunassociated with, and the three hundred of his letters which are extant\r\nform a valuable contribution to history. Twice was the exiled St. Anselm\r\nof Canterbury his guest, and in 1107 Paschal II--the pope who built the\r\nupper church of S. Clemente at Rome--stopped with him in Chartres.\r\nBishop Ives had been a pupil at Bec, of the celebrated Lanfranc, so he\r\nwas fully competent to keep up the prestige of his cathedral school.\r\n\r\nThe Romanesque basilica, begun by Fulbert and finished by Bishop Ives,\r\nlasted for over two hundred years. The present northwest tower was\r\nstarted probably in 1134, when the nave's western bays had been damaged\r\nby fire. Following a pre-Romanesque tradition, the tower was placed a\r\nlittle distance before the church, apart from it, and so it remained for\r\nsome ten years. Then, one day in June, 1144, the eloquent Bishop\r\nGeoffrey de Lèves, successor of St. Ives, was the guest of the abbot of\r\nSt. Denis during the dedication of Suger's abbatial, and what he there\r\nsaw of the new system of building made him determined to reconstruct\r\nhis own church of Chartres. Being an excellent administrator, he was\r\nable to start the new works immediately.\r\n\r\nWithin a year was begun the southwest tower of Chartres (1145), which\r\nmany hold to be the most beautiful in the world. While it was building,\r\nthe side aisles of Fulbert's basilica were lengthened to meet both\r\nwestern towers. That the one to the south never was intended to stand\r\nisolated is shown by the absence of windows on the two sides where it\r\njoins the church, whereas the tower to the north had windows on all four\r\nsides. While these works were in progress St. Bernard came to Chartres\r\nto preach the Second Crusade. He and Bishop Geoffrey had recently\r\ntraveled together through Aquitaine, combating the Cartharist heresy.\r\n\r\nIt was Geoffrey de Lèves who accompanied the future Louis VII to\r\nBordeaux for his marriage with Aliénor of Aquitaine, and when the death\r\nof the king suddenly called Louis away, he left his bride in the care of\r\nthe bishop of Chartres. Geoffrey was long the sincere defender of\r\nAbélard, though finally he disapproved of what was overhardy in his\r\ndoctrine; with Peter of Cluny he held that the errors of the brilliant\r\nschoolman were of the head rather than the heart.\r\n\r\nTwo often-quoted ancient records described the surge of religious fervor\r\nwhich raised the western end of Chartres Cathedral. In 1145 the\r\narchbishop of Rouen wrote to the bishop of Amiens to relate how the\r\npeople of his diocese, knights and ladies, townspeople and peasants,\r\nwent in a spirit of penitence to Chartres, there to help in the new work\r\nof Notre Dame. No one could join the pilgrimage who had not confessed,\r\nand renounced all enmities and revenges. As the quarries were some miles\r\nfrom the city, it was a heavy task to drag in the big stones. In that\r\nsame 1145 Abbot Haimon of St. Pierre-sur-Dives in Normandy, wrote to\r\nsome monks in England to picture the scenes at Chartres: \"Whoever heard\r\ntell in times past of powerful princes brought up in honors and wealth,\r\nof noble men and women bending their proud necks to the harness of\r\ncarts, and like beasts of burden dragging stones, cement, wood, to\r\nbuild the abode of Christ? And while men of all ranks drag these heavy\r\nloads--so great the weight that sometimes a thousand are attached to one\r\nwagon--they march in such silence that not a murmur is heard. When they\r\nhalt by the roadside, only the confessing of sins, and prayer, humbly\r\nsuppliant, ascend to God. If anyone is so hardened as to refuse to\r\npardon his enemies, he is detached from the cart and refused\r\ncompanionship in that holy company. When they have reached the church\r\nthey arrange the wagons about it like a spiritual camp, and during the\r\nwhole night they celebrate the watch by hymns and canticles.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this wave of enthusiasm that the Portal Royal was\r\nbegun, probably about 1155, though some have placed those three western\r\ndoors earlier and some later. As they resembled the doors of St. Denis\r\n(now destroyed), they were made, doubtlessly, within ten or fifteen\r\nyears of Suger's work. By 1175 cracks appeared in the new west\r\nfoundations, and the three doors were moved forward, stone by stone, and\r\nplaced on a line with the towers. In their first position, set back\r\nbetween the advancing towers, they had shown to better advantage, but it\r\nis to the advance of Chartres' western façade that we owe the\r\npreservation of its priceless glass and sculpture.\r\n\r\nAt the time of these changes the bishop of Chartres was John of\r\nSalisbury (1176-80), perhaps the most learned man of his century, and\r\ncertainly one of the wisest, sincerest, and most likable men who ever\r\nlived. In his works this humanist advocated a proper use of dialectics,\r\nas opposed to the sterile subtlety then increasing among scholars. His\r\nstand on the problem which agitated the thinkers then--how our ideas\r\ncorrespond to things existing outside our intellect--was one of moderate\r\nrealism. Abélard had led up to such an outlook, and the scholastics of\r\nthe XIII century, notably Aquinas, also classed themselves as moderate\r\nrealists. John of Salisbury possessed what the French call _esprit_, and\r\nhe poked some fun at the hair-splitting in the schools. Hebrew and\r\nGreek he knew, and his Latin was of good literary quality, which was\r\nrather an exception among scholastic writers.\r\n\r\nWhen Thomas Becket was raised to the see of Canterbury, his friend, John\r\nof Salisbury, became his chief adviser, and though the latter held\r\nprinciples equally firm, he endeavored to curb the primate's excess of\r\nzeal. Through the years of Becket's exile, John lived in France,\r\nreturned with his archbishop to England, and witnessed his martyrdom in\r\nCanterbury Cathedral. At Sens he, too, must have watched with interest\r\nthat cathedral building, being himself an artist and modeler in clay.\r\nSens' archbishop, Guillaume de Champagne, admired the balanced character\r\nand solid scholarship of the Englishman, and after the Canterbury\r\ntragedy proposed him for the see of Chartres. No one could have\r\nappreciated better than John of Salisbury the strange charm and beauty\r\nof the column statues which one by one were moved to a new position at\r\nhis cathedral's west doors while he governed this see.\r\n\r\nAnd no one was more fitted to comprehend the glory of the three\r\nXII-century windows, also dismounted and reset in those years, than John\r\nof Salisbury's successor at Chartres, his intimate of many years past,\r\nPierre de Celle, who, while abbot of St. Remi at Rheims, had adorned the\r\nlovely Primary Gothic choir he built there with admirable colored\r\nlights. The south tower was crowned with its mighty spire in his day,\r\nand he paved the streets of Chartres and raised the town walls. Both\r\nthese best types of scholastic authors were interested in maintaining\r\nthe high repute of their cathedral school. As Pierre de Celle died in\r\n1183, he was spared the sight of his cathedral's destruction.\r\n\r\nOn the night of June 10, 1194, a terrible conflagration wiped out\r\nFulbert's Romanesque basilica. To its cavernous crypt the clerks bore\r\nthe treasured relics, and after three days emerged, when the fire was\r\nspent. Only the crypt and the more recent west façade, with its two\r\ntowers, escaped destruction; the north tower at the time still lacked\r\nits upper stories.\r\n\r\nOn the smoking ruins the pope's legate made an appeal to the people's\r\ngenerosity, and once again Chartres presented the devotional scenes of\r\n1145. Bishop and canons gave up three years of their revenue, and pious\r\nconfraternities dragged in the big stones. Those passionate rivals,\r\nRichard Coeur-de-Lion and Philippe-Auguste, were donors. Thus every\r\npart of Chartres Cathedral has been raised by the hands and hearts of\r\nfaith, and surely the personality which builders impart to their work\r\nbreathes here in a piety of the soul that not all the science of later\r\ntimes has ever been able to simulate. _Non est hic aliud nisi Domus Dei\r\net porta coeli._\r\n\r\nThe new cathedral went forward apace; early in the XIII century the big\r\nwest rose was added to the much-transformed façade. By 1224 the upper\r\nvaulting was entirely closed in. The formal dedication was postponed\r\ntill 1260, to allow for the completion of the two elaborate porches\r\nbefore the transept's doors. To that delayed consecration came St. Louis\r\nand his court.\r\n\r\nThe name of the architect of Chartres is unknown, but its unity of plan\r\nis proof that it emanated from the brain of one man. The choir had\r\ndouble aisles, the nave a single one. It is believed that to the absence\r\nof side chapels in the nave is due the exceptionally good acoustic\r\nproperties of this church in which the preacher's voice carries to every\r\npart. Unknown, too, is the architect of the tower built in the dawn of\r\nGothic art, two generations before the present cathedral. The veriest\r\namateur as he gazes at it is conscious that he has before him one of the\r\nsupreme things of France.\r\n\r\nThe more closely the _clocher vieux_ is analyzed, the more it becomes a\r\ntouchstone by which will be judged other towers. A miracle of just\r\ngradation, it sprang in one jet from the brain of a man of genius. With\r\na pleasurable sense of harmony the eye travels from the base to the tip\r\nof the spire. Proportion, not ornament, is the secret of its\r\ntranscendent influence. The width is right--and so many towers fail\r\nthere--the division of the stories is right, and radiantly right is\r\nthat crucial point, the transition from the vertical square shaft to\r\nthe inclined octagonal spire, accomplished here by means of dormers and\r\nturrets. An innovator was the architect of Chartres' belfry when he\r\nplaced open windows in the gables. To obviate any monotonous optical\r\neffect, he made a ridge down each inclined plane of the spire, which\r\nspire is a massive pyramid forming almost half of the tower's height.\r\nIts bare nobility surpasses the richer open stonework of the spire to\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Cathedral of Chartres (1194-1240). The Southern\r\nAspect_]\r\n\r\nIt is confusing that the north tower at Chartres façade should be called\r\nthe _clocher neuf_ because of its Flamboyant Gothic upper stories, for\r\nits lower Romanesque parts were built before the _clocher vieux_. When\r\ntowers were rising in every part of France as the XVI century opened,\r\nthe chapter of Chartres Cathedral invited a local architect, Jean de\r\nTexier, called Jean de Beauce,[109] to complete their truncated\r\nnorthern tower, whose temporary top had just been consumed by fire. Jean\r\nde Beauce saw that the XIII-century rose window had crowded the south\r\nbelfry. While the rose was making, a new story had been added to the\r\nnorth tower. To that tower he decided to add still another story before\r\nhe topped it with an elaborate lacework spire. In consequence the\r\n_clocher neuf_ is out of all proportion to its mate. Nor does it carry\r\nthe eye smoothly from soil to tip; its renewals are abrupt. However, if\r\nit lacks subtlety, its crown is none the less a strikingly effective\r\nmonument of the final phase of Gothic architecture. The spire is\r\nadjusted to the shaft by means of little flying buttresses which spring\r\nfrom the angle and face turrets, and help to unify the design.\r\n\r\nSome human vanity the north tower of Chartres displays, but no arrogant\r\npride, no Renaissance pretentiousness. And in the inscription\r\ncommemorating its renewal still breathes the reverential, loving,\r\npersonal note of the Middle Ages:\r\n\r\n\"I was once built of lead, till after the fire on the feast of St. Anne,\r\nsix o'clock in the evening, 1506, Messires the Chapter ordered me\r\nrebuilt in stone. In my necessity good people helped me. May God be\r\ngracious to them.\"\r\n\r\nUnder his belfry tower, Jehan de Beauce built a pretty pavilion to\r\nregulate its chimes. Sculptor as well as architect, he designed the\r\nsumptuous screen about the choir, on whose exterior wall is portrayed\r\nthe life of Our Lord in groups made during seven generations. The oldest\r\nand best scenes are those in the south aisle nearest the transept.\r\n\r\nThe mystery plays gave to the iconography of the late XV century its\r\nrealistic character. In these sculpture panels at Chartres, not only\r\nwere the costumes of the religious theater copied, but the stage\r\nsettings. A group was represented in a room, whereas in earlier work the\r\nsacred personages \"stood with a sort of spiritualized detachment, clad\r\nin the long tunic of no country, of no time, the very vestment itself\r\nfor the life eternal.\"[110]\r\n\r\nOne of the earlier scenes of Chartres' choir screen presents Our Lady\r\nseated in the cosiest of interiors, like a XVI-century housewife, a\r\nreticule by her side and a chaplet, which last touch was a charming\r\nanachronism. She sews serenely while poor distracted St. Joseph dreams.\r\nA complete contrast to this human Virgin Mother is a XIII-century lancet\r\nacross the aisle from it--the much-venerated\r\nNotre-Dame-de-la-belle-verrière, a mother of God, the austere symbolic\r\nThrone of Solomon, almost uncanny in her solemn passiveness. In some of\r\nthe later groups sculptured on the outer walls of the choir screen\r\nappears the icy hand of the Renaissance, though the setting remained\r\nGothic throughout.\r\n\r\nThe two decorative glories of Chartres Cathedral are its sculptured\r\nportals and its wealth of stained glass, \"an assemblage unique in\r\nEurope, the thought of the Middle Ages made visible.\" Though over ten\r\nthousand personages are represented, decoration is kept subordinate to\r\nstructure with an instinct for discipline inherent in the best Gothic\r\nart.\r\n\r\nFor the archæologist, the three western doors are of prime importance,\r\nlast of the Romanesque, first of the Gothic portals, call them whichever\r\nyou wish. To speak of a transition is to be metaphysical, employing\r\nwords for what has no existence in reality, since there was no break in\r\nthe sequence of sculpture from the first imaged portals of French\r\nRomanesque art, at Beaulieu, Moissac, Autun and Vézelay to those at Le\r\nMans and Chartres, and to that masterpiece of Gothic sculpture, the\r\nportal of Our Lady under the northwest tower of Paris Cathedral.\r\n\r\nFor the making of his three western doors at Chartres, Bishop Geoffrey\r\nde Lèves must have obtained workers from his friend, Abbot Suger of St.\r\nDenis. Archaic enough seem these kings and queens with their strange,\r\nhaunting faces, their slim, parallel feet, with their slender figures\r\nmore architectural than sculptural as they stand against the pillars to\r\nwhich they conform, yet none the less they show freedom from the\r\nstereotyped Byzantine traditions. The attitudes are less rigid than in\r\nprevious column statues, and personality is dawning in the faces. The\r\nMadonna is own sister of the Eastern empress of St. Anne's door at\r\nParis, made about fifteen years later under Bishop Maurice de Sully.\r\n\r\nThe \"celestial portal\" of Chartres portrayed the life of Christ from his\r\nbirth to his ascension. At the northern doors of the transept was set\r\nforth the Creation, to the coming of the Messiah, and Our Lady was\r\nespecially honored. And the southern portal commemorated from the coming\r\nof the Lord to his second advent at the Last Judgment. It was the custom\r\nto represent this last scene at the west façade, where it might be\r\nillumined by the setting sun of the world's final day, the _dies iræ_\r\nlong dreaded. But since the west portal of Chartres had followed a\r\nRomanesque tradition by carving in its place of honor a Christ in the\r\nelliptical aureole of eternity, accompanied by the symbols of the four\r\nevangelists, the Last Judgment was relegated to the transept's south\r\nentrance.\r\n\r\nBetween the two lateral portals of Chartres there is little choice. In\r\nthem Gothic sculpture appears in full bloom. Each is a national\r\nheritage. In the first plan of the transept the entrances lacked their\r\nmagnificent porches begun as afterthoughts (about 1240), but so well\r\nadjusted to the doors that they appear to be of the same date. Among\r\nthe seven hundred statues at the northern entrance, some show that they\r\nwere portrait studies, but it is mere hypothesis to give names to them.\r\nNot a statue was placed haphazard. A prearranged dogmatic scheme was\r\nconsistently followed, since to the mediæval mind art was before all\r\nelse a teacher. Our Lady stands at the central door, accompanied by ten\r\nbig figures representing Melchisedek, Abraham, Moses, Samuel, and David\r\non her right, and Isaac, Jeremiah, Simeon, John the Baptist, and St.\r\nPeter on her left. They are the patriarchs who prefigured her Son and\r\nthe prophets who foretold Him, and the two who witnessed His coming, one\r\nas foreteller, the other to be His symbol in the future. Each\r\npersonified a period of history: \"Fathers of the people, pillars of\r\nhumanity, contemporaries of the first days of the world, they seem to\r\nbelong to another humanity than ours. They are to be counted among the\r\nmost extraordinary images of the Middle Ages.\" It is inevitable that M.\r\nMâle be quoted on all points of mediæval iconography.\r\n\r\nUsually under each large statue was carved a pedestal scene having some\r\nconnection with it. Thus beneath the Queen of Sheba is a negro; beneath\r\nBalaam, his ass. At the south porch, under St. Jerome, translator of the\r\nBible, is the Synagogue with bandaged eyes, and under St. Gregory the\r\nGreat is a crouching scribe, who cranes his neck to see the saint, for\r\nthe legend was that one day as the pope dictated to his secretary, a\r\nlong pause came, and the scribe peeped through the curtain that hung\r\nbetween them and saw a dove perched on the saint's shoulder, symbolic of\r\nthe Holy Spirit directing him. St. George and St. Theodore garbed as\r\ncrusaders are the only youthful images at the south porch, and must have\r\nbeen studied from some of St. Louis' knights.\r\n\r\nAt her entranceways Chartres set forth the calendar of months in small\r\nmedallioned allegories, and here and at Amiens, Paris, and Rheims was\r\ngiven a complete system of moral philosophy through the contrast of\r\nvirtues with vices. On the north façade of Chartres is carved \"Libertas\"\r\nunder the image of a virtue. Bishop John of Salisbury would have\r\napproved this: \"For there is nothing more glorious than freedom,\" he\r\nwrote, \"save virtue, if indeed freedom may be rightly severed from\r\nvirtue, for all who know anything know that true freedom has no other\r\nsource.\"\r\n\r\nIn structural technique the fenestration of Chartres was a stride\r\nforward, and both the cathedrals of Paris and Soissons learned\r\nimmediately from its clearstory arrangement--the first attempt to fill\r\nwith colored glass the entire space between the active wall shafts. \"In\r\ncertain parts of the cathedral of Chartres,\" says M. Mâle, \"is a\r\nmagnificent amplitude, a superabundance of power. Each of the nave's\r\nwindows is surmounted by an immense rose as wide as the bay, a\r\nconception as proud as ever an architect realized. It is one of those\r\nflashes of genius such as came to Michael Angelo. Those great orbs of\r\nlight, those wheels of fire that dart sparkling rays are one of the\r\nbeauties of the cathedral.\"[111]\r\n\r\nNotre Dame has preserved over two hundred of the ancient, imaged\r\nwindows. The oldest and the best are three large lancets under the\r\nwestern rose which, like the Royal Portal beneath them, are the work of\r\nSuger's craftsmen who came here from St. Denis. One of these noted\r\nwindows relates the childhood of Christ, another His Passion and\r\nResurrection, and the third is a tree of Jesse, similar to one in St.\r\nDenis.[112] The iron bars supporting the sheet of glass do not conform\r\nto the outline of the medallions, hence it is somewhat more difficult to\r\ndecipher the scenes than in XIII-century work. None the less, these, the\r\noldest windows of the cathedral, are the peer of any colored glass ever\r\nmade, because of their inherent genius for decorative effect and their\r\nconscientious workmanship. Many a pen has tried--in vain--to describe\r\nthe marvelous deep blue which blends together the other colors--the\r\nstreaky ruby, the emerald green, the sea-green white, the brownish\r\npurple and pink, the yellow pot metal.\r\n\r\nEven after the opening of the XIII century the St. Denis school exerted\r\ninfluence, as is shown by the Charlemagne-Roland windows in Chartres'\r\nambulatory, whose outline was taken from a crusader window of Suger's\r\nabbey. The majority of Chartres' windows belong to the early XIII\r\ncentury, when the city was mistress of the vitrine art and supplied the\r\ncathedrals of Bourges, Rouen, Sens, Laon, Auxerre, Tours, Le Mans,\r\nPoitiers, and even Canterbury. In the nave's north aisle, the St.\r\nEustace window (the third) is held to be of faultless artistry. The\r\nlarge lancets which light the aisles scintillate as with precious\r\njewels. Only some five or six have floral scrolls filling the spaces\r\nbetween the medallions and the deep border that surrounds each window;\r\nin France a geometric pattern for such interstices was more frequent.\r\n\r\nAt the base of each window is what is called its signature--a medallion\r\nwhich usually represents the avocation of the donors, whether kings,\r\nknights, priests, butchers, shoemakers, furriers, or water carriers.\r\nThus below the Charlemagne-Roland windows tradesmen display rich fur\r\nmantles, and we know that the _pelletiers_ were the donors. Splendid\r\nwere the gifts of the old artisan guilds. The tanners presented an\r\napse-chapel window in honor of St. Thomas Becket, the vintners one that\r\nrelated the story of Noe, planter of vines. An overpowering sensation it\r\nmust have been for those mediæval workmen to worship beneath the vaults\r\nthey themselves had helped to build, under the windows they had\r\ncontributed. Kings and knights were their fellow donors, but in the\r\ncathedrals of France the gifts of the lowly were the most plentiful, a\r\nChristian quality which endured till the XVI-century disunion.\r\n\r\nTo Chartres St. Louis gave a window in honor of St. Denis, patron of his\r\nkingdom. The splendid red northern rose, \"The Rose of France,\" is a\r\nglorification of Our Lady. The donjons of Castile adorn it in honor of\r\nthe queen regent. Directly opposite is the big south rose presented by\r\nBlanche's enemy, Pierre Mauclerc, who tried to kidnap Louis IX from his\r\nmother, but who was to die fighting the infidels under his cousin the\r\nking, as did Pierre de Courtenay, another donor of a window at Chartres.\r\nPierre de Dreux, it is said, began the porch before the southern\r\nentrance to commemorate his marriage with the heiress of Brittany, a\r\ngranddaughter of Henry II, Plantagenet. Like every door of this church\r\nof the resplendent entranceways, it is a mass of sculpture. Mauclerc was\r\ngrandson of the builder of St. Yved at Braine, and brother of Archbishop\r\nHenri de Dreux, who donated windows to his cathedral at Rheims. Below\r\nthe Dreux rose at Chartres, four of the Prophets are borne on the\r\nshoulders of the four Evangelists, for never could those generations,\r\nenamored of symmetry, resist the opportunity to weave together the Old\r\nand New Testaments.\r\n\r\nA first cousin of St. Louis, Ferdinand III, the saint-conqueror of\r\nSeville and Cordova, donated to Chartres a window commemorating the\r\npatron of Spain. Three times was St. James honored here, so popular was\r\nthe Santiago Compostela pilgrimage. St. Martin and St. Nicolas of Bari\r\nare also commemorated, the former some seven times, for it pleased the\r\nvoyagers to noted shrines to record their travels. By pilgrimages French\r\nart and song spread in Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\nSingle monumental figures of prophet or saint were used in the\r\nclearstory windows instead of small medallions, which would be\r\nindistinct when viewed at such a height. Although most of the windows in\r\nthe cathedral belong to the XIII century, the XV century is represented\r\nin the Vendôme chapel, begun in 1417 by Louis de Bourbon, an ancestor of\r\nHenry IV. Much white was then employed for the better lighting of the\r\nchurch, and the straight saddle-bars of Suger's time were again made use\r\nof.\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made for perspective in the earlier glass, which was\r\ntreated like a translucent mosaic: relief was obtained by the skilled\r\njuxtaposition of tones. The old workers had taught themselves many of\r\nthe secrets of optics. They knew that designs on a background of\r\nblue--an expansive color--should be larger than those on red--an\r\nabsorbent. They knew that blue was a sedative, that red excited the\r\nvision, and that yellow stopped contours, hence it was to be employed in\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nIt is not of technique that one thinks when standing face to face with\r\nthe windows of Chartres. \"Create in me a new heart, O God!\" one murmurs\r\nwhen gazing at them. When at noon the sun renders the colors dazzling\r\nand bewildering, the cathedral seems to be chanting \"_Sanctus! Sanctus!\r\nSanctus!_\" with the seraphim proclaiming that the whole earth is full of\r\nthe glory of the Lord. Live coals from heaven's high altar are the\r\nwindows of Chartres, then, cleansing us of our iniquities; and seeing\r\nwith our eyes we see, and hearing with our ears we hear, and\r\nunderstanding with our heart we comprehend the vision and are converted\r\nand healed.\r\n\r\nWhen evening blots out the rest of the church, and in luminous obscurity\r\nthe windows hang ethereally in space, they are psalms of intercession\r\nand penitence. To gaze at such windows is to pray, think the Levites who\r\nserve in this temple. At sunset it is no unusual sight to see a young\r\nstudent of theology seated with his back to the choir, his forgotten\r\nbreviary open on his knee, gazing spellbound at the western lancets, in\r\nhis face a rapt reverence, indicating that his soul is in prayer. Each\r\nevening the windows of Abbot Suger's craftsmen hymn the suave and lovely\r\n_Te Lucis ante_ which ushers in night's purity. A mediæval cathedral was\r\ndesigned for the Real Presence, and without that soul of all ritual it\r\nstands bereft. Windows such as Chartres' proclaim the miracle of the\r\nTabernacle as symbolically as do those pillars of humanity sculptured by\r\nthe northern doors, Melchisedek and Peter, types of the Christ, each\r\nholding a chalice, or as do the transept's outspread arms that recall\r\nthe sacrifice on Calvary, renewed daily in the sacrifice of the Mass.\r\n\r\nThat Chartres Cathedral has preserved its wealth of colored glass is\r\nproof that it came gently through the ages; moreover, it was constructed\r\nsolidly, being a pioneer in the use of flying buttresses with double\r\narches united by an arcature. Its lower walls never were weakened by the\r\ninsertion of side chapels, those customary XIV-century additions. That\r\nacademic period built at Chartres merely the semi-detached chapel of St.\r\nPiat, to which a stair ascends from the ambulatory. In the XVIII century\r\nsome well-intentioned but misguided canons of the cathedral lined their\r\nsanctuary with neo-classic marbles and stucco, and cluttered the plain\r\nwall spaces over the pier arches with needless ornament.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Revolution, the entire demolition of the big church\r\nwas proposed, but happily the embarrassment of how to dispose of such a\r\nmountain of stone prevented the vandalism. Lead was stripped from the\r\nroof to make bullets and pennies. In the XIX century the vast timber\r\ncovering of the masonry vaults, called _la forêt_, was burned, but the\r\nnew steep-pitched roof covered with lead has taken on a greenish hue\r\nthat blends well with the ancient gray stones.\r\n\r\nThe easy hill of the town serves as pedestal for Chartres Cathedral.\r\nWalk through the little city, whose air of cold propriety is very\r\ntypical of French provincial life, pass through the Porte Guillaume, and\r\nfrom the boulevard beside the stream study the chief edifice of this\r\nBeauce which is \"the granary of France.\" Observe how salient are the\r\ntransept arms. Another Romanesque trait is the placing of two\r\ntowers--unfinished here--between choir and transept. What Huysmans\r\ncalled the _maigreur distinguée_ of youth is a characteristic of this\r\nchurch. In Rheims, the next begun of the big Gothic cathedrals, is no\r\ntrace of youth's structural plainness.\r\n\r\nAs you sit by the stream watching Notre Dame of Chartres, its Flamboyant\r\nGothic tower, perfect of its kind, seems to ride imperiously over the\r\nnave; none the less it will be the weather-beaten southwest tower on\r\nwhich the eye will linger longest. Though it was designed to accompany a\r\nchurch of lesser proportions, though it labors under the disadvantage\r\nof being overtopped by its sister beacon, nothing can diminish its\r\nunparalleled unity. Virile, virginal, aërial, majestic, venerable in\r\nyouth and youthful in its venerable age, the _clocher vieux_ of Chartres\r\nis one of the supreme things of the national art, \"full of sweet dreams\r\nand health and quiet breathing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF RHEIMS[113]\r\n\r\n     The nation that made a compact with God at the baptismal font of\r\n     Rheims will be converted and will return to her first vocation. Her\r\n     errors may not go unpunished, but the child of such virtues, of so\r\n     many sighs, of so many tears, will not perish. A day will come, and\r\n     we hope it may not long tarry, when France, like Saul on the road\r\n     to Damascus, will be enveloped in a supernal light whence will\r\n     proceed a voice, asking: \"Why persecutest thou me? Rise up and wash\r\n     the stains that disfigure thee. Go, first-born of the Church,\r\n     predestined nation, race of election, go carry as in the past my\r\n     name before all the peoples and before all the kings of the\r\n     earth.\"--Address of POPE PIUS X, in 1912, to the visiting French\r\n     cardinals.\r\n\r\nThe other two of the four great cathedrals have no setting equal to the\r\nhill pedestal of Chartres or to the river island of Notre Dame of Paris.\r\nSeldom is a French cathedral surrounded by the pleasant precincts and\r\ncloisters preserved by the English minsters, and Rheims Cathedral is no\r\nexception in its abrupt rise from flat city streets. Its druidical\r\nmassiveness can easily dispense with a pedestal. Rheims imposes itself.\r\nEven in the night its prodigy of magnificence endures. \"The huge\r\nbas-relief is always there in the darkness,\" wrote Rodin. \"I cannot\r\ndistinguish it, but I feel it. Its beauty persists. It triumphs over\r\nshadows and forces me to admire its powerful black harmony. It fills my\r\nwindow, it almost hides the sky. How explain why, even when enveloped in\r\nnight, this cathedral loses nothing of its beauty? Does the power of\r\nthat beauty transcend the senses, that the eye sees what it sees not?...\r\n_O Nuit! tu es plus grande ici que partout ailleurs!_\"[114]\r\n\r\nThe \"masters of the living stone\" who built Rheims Cathedral are known\r\nto us to-day. Their names were commemorated in a labyrinth that once\r\nformed part of the nave's pavement, a drawing of which has been\r\nunearthed by M. Louis Demaison. The obliterated figure in the middle of\r\nthe labyrinth no doubt represented the bishop who laid the foundation\r\nstone. He was Albéric de Humbert, formerly archdeacon of Notre Dame at\r\nParis while the bishops Maurice and Eudes de Sully were raising that\r\ncathedral. Builder and crusader, Albéric was a true product of his age.\r\nHe marched into Languedoc, in 1208, to chastise the Albigensian\r\nheretics; he attended Innocent III's great Council of the Lateran in\r\n1214, and when he ventured again to the East to take part in the crusade\r\nof Jean de Brienne, he was captured by Saracens and ransomed by the\r\nSpanish knights of Calatrava. He died on the return journey, 1218.\r\n\r\nFor a man of such energy, it could have been with slight regret that he\r\nwitnessed, in May, 1210, the destruction by fire of the decrepit church\r\nhe had inherited, one of whose builders had been Archbishop Hincmar in\r\nthe IX century. That early cathedral of Rheims had been redressed with a\r\nfaçade by Archbishop Sampson, a friend of Abbot Suger's, and among the\r\nprelates who attended the memorable dedication of St. Denis. His Primary\r\nGothic work, wiped out in the conflagration of 1210, was a loss indeed\r\nfor art.\r\n\r\nBishop Albéric de Humbert set vigorously to work, and within a year of\r\nthe fire had laid the corner stone of the present cathedral (1211). By\r\n1241 services were held in the finished choir. An archbishop of the\r\nDreux line (1227-40) gave windows to the upper apse, and although he and\r\nthe townsfolk were at bitter odds, the building of the great church by\r\nboth prelate and people went on unabated. The imperious Henri de Dreux,\r\nlike Pierre Mauclerc, the donor of Chartres' south rose, was a grandson\r\nof that brother of King Louis VII who built the beautiful church of St.\r\nYved at Braine on the highway between Rheims and Soissons. While the\r\ncathedral of Rheims was building, another of its archbishops was a\r\nJoinville, and in 1270 its sixtieth ruler died on St. Louis' last\r\ncrusade.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the cathedral was made by Jean d'Orbais, who had watched the\r\nerection of the abbatial (1180) in his native town of Orbais,[115] a\r\nchurch modeled on the choir of St. Remi which the celebrated schoolman\r\nPierre de Celle had built from 1170 to 1180. Thus Orbais is the\r\nintermediary between the big abbey church of Rheims and Rheims\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years Jean d'Orbais directed the works at Rheims, so stated\r\nthe inscription in the labyrinth; and on his death Jean de Loup became\r\ndirecting architect for sixteen years (1231-47), during which the\r\ntransept and its portals were constructed. The third architect, Gaucher\r\nde Rheims (1250-59), began the west portals and worked on the nave. In\r\nhis precious notebook, Villard de Honnecourt sketched a bay of the nave\r\nbefore 1250. The fourth master-of-works at Rheims, whose name was\r\ninscribed in the labyrinth, was Bernard de Soissons. He worked here for\r\nthirty-five years; the inscription states that he made five bays of the\r\nnave--no doubt the westernmost ones--and that he opened the big O, the\r\nrose window of twelve mammoth petals that flowers in the west façade,\r\nand is one of the most beautiful designs of the age. By the end of the\r\nXIII century, therefore, Rheims Cathedral was completed in its main\r\nparts. Carried on with scarcely a pause, and always after the original\r\nplan of Jean d'Orbais, the great church kept its unity throughout. The\r\nfirst four architects who during a century had directed the works were\r\nsucceeded by Robert de Coucy, to whom for a time was erroneously\r\nattributed the original plan, but who really continued to build the\r\nelaborate west façade.\r\n\r\nThat frontispiece of Rheims Cathedral, with its cloud of witnesses, is a\r\nculmination of Gothic art. Some have called it a work of the XIV\r\ncentury, but the labyrinth, set in the pavement before Robert de Coucy's\r\nday, distinctly attributed the placing of the big rose window to Bernard\r\nde Soissons, who was in the city till 1298. Also a text of 1299 refers\r\nto one of the west towers, and the armor worn in the David-Goliath group\r\nof the gable is of the 1280 type. All critics acknowledge that the big\r\nstatues of the portals belong in main part to the golden period of\r\nGothic sculpture, and were done between 1250 and 1260.[116] The images\r\nunder the southwest tower had been prepared about thirty years earlier,\r\nin the time of Jean d'Orbais. The façade of Rheims inspired many a later\r\nGothic frontispiece--Meaux, Tours, Rouen, Troyes, and Abbeville.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral went on perfecting itself in detail, and was nearing a\r\ncomplete finish when, four months after the raising of the siege of\r\nOrléans, Jeanne d'Arc brought her king to be crowned in the city where\r\ntwo hundred years earlier St. Louis had been anointed. Three gentlemen\r\nof Anjou wrote a letter to the queen of Charles VII, Marie of Anjou, and\r\nto her mother, Jolande of Aragon, to describe the ceremonies at Rheims\r\non that fifth day of August, 1429. As the crown was set on the king's\r\nhead trumpets rang out, till it seemed that the vaults would crack, and\r\nevery man cried \"_Noël!_\" and drew his sword. A fair sight it was to see\r\nthe gallant bearing of Jeanne the Maid as she stood by the king, holding\r\nthe banner she cherished more than the sword.\r\n\r\nAt her trial in Rouen even her standard was used against her. \"Why,\"\r\nasked her judges, \"was your banner carried into the church of Rheims to\r\nthe consecration rather than those of the other captains?\" And Jeanne\r\nmade one of her ringing answers: \"It had been in the fray, surely there\r\nwas good reason it should be at the victory\"--_à la peine ... à\r\nl'honneur_--her phrase was to become a proverb of France.[117] Jeanne\r\nliked fair play. In her army she would tolerate no pillage, nor eat of\r\nfood which she thought had been so obtained. But then Jeanne had no\r\n_Kultur_. She was merely an unlettered peasant girl of the Middle Ages,\r\nwho called it plain thieving to carry off household goods in an invaded\r\ncountry. For her good friends of Rheims _la bonne Lorraine_ kept a warm\r\nplace in her memory, as her letter to them showed: \"_Mes chiers et bons\r\namis les bons et loyaulx Franxois de la cité de Rains, Jehanne la\r\nPucelle vous faict à savoir de ses nouvelles ... je vous promect et\r\ncertiffy que je ne vous abandonneray poinct_.\"\r\n\r\nNot many years after that national hour of rejoicing the cathedral of\r\nRheims suffered a disaster which put a stop to further construction;\r\nhenceforth only restorations went on. In 1481 some careless plumbers set\r\non fire the timber overroof and the molten lead ran like a river into\r\nthe streets. Many a citizen perished in the effort to check the flames.\r\nThe stone roof of the cathedral stood firm, justifying those generations\r\nwhose life struggle had been the problem how to cover their churches\r\nenduringly. Though all France contributed, the huge edifice was never to\r\nbe crowned by the six spires of Jean d'Orbais' plan; yet even as it is,\r\nRheims presents the ideal exterior of a Gothic cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe main façade was made most appropriately a thing of pomp and\r\ncircumstance, regal and gorgeous for the royal coronations. No need to\r\nhang such walls with tapestries for the feast. The three deep portals\r\nwere united as one by means of an unbroken line of thirty or more large\r\nimages, deriving from similar arrays at Chartres and Amiens, but\r\npossessing a pronounced indigenous genius. In the groups of the\r\nAnnunciation and the Presentation the Blessed Virgin is a figure of\r\nspotless purity, meek and infinitely touching in her little mantle that\r\nfalls in straight simplicity from her slender shoulders. \"By humility\r\nthe holy Virgin merited to become the mother of God,\" was the answer\r\ngiven by St. Isabelle of France, the only sister of St. Louis, when\r\nasked why she named her convent at Longchamp, L'Humilité-Notre-Dame. A\r\nvery different Virgin is that in the Visitation group. She and St.\r\nElizabeth are draped voluminously like stately Roman matrons. Those two\r\nstatues (imitated by Bamburg Cathedral in 1280) must have been inspired\r\nby some work of antiquity, of which Rheims possessed a number. Classic\r\ninfluences in the imagery of northern France during the Middle Ages was\r\ntransitory, however. First and last mediæval sculpture was a\r\nbuilding-stone sculpture.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes and on the lips of a few of the entranceway statues hovered\r\na half-smile, a fleeting, rare expression which, long centuries before,\r\nthe Greek sculptors preceding Phidias had achieved. Again, at the\r\nRenaissance, Da Vinci was obsessed by the same expression, \"born of a\r\nmiracle, meant to gladden men's souls forever.\" To-day, the angel image\r\nLa Sourire stands headless at the portal under the north tower.\r\n\r\nNot only was the west frontispiece of Rheims unique, but its transept\r\nfaçades would have distinguished any cathedral. One of the three doors\r\nof the north façade is composed of fragments from a monument which had\r\nbeen in the Romanesque metropolitan burned in 1210. The middle door\r\ncommemorates local saints, for cathedrals were historians and linked the\r\ngenerations with that continuance of tradition which makes the strength\r\nof a race. To honor their spiritual forefathers was held to be\r\npatriotism by those believing generations. At both west and north\r\nfaçades was an image of St. Nicaise, the eleventh bishop of Rheims, who\r\nhad been martyred as he knelt by his cathedral door. Tradition relates\r\nthat he was reciting the Psalmist's words, \"My soul is bowed to earth,\"\r\nwhen the Vandals struck off his head, and that the severed head finished\r\nthe verse: \"Verify me, O Lord, according to thy word.\"[118]\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth bishop (459-533), St. Remigius, apostle of the Franks, is\r\nhonored by a statue. In the cathedral of his day he baptized Clovis, and\r\nthus made France the first orthodox Christian kingdom of the West, since\r\nGaul's other conquerors had fallen into the Arian heresy. Many an\r\narchbishop of Rheims played a foremost part in the life of the nation.\r\nThe military prowess of Turpin, the twenty-seventh prelate here, is\r\nrelated in the _Chanson de Roland_.[119] The forty-first archbishop was\r\nthe learned Gerbert, who died Pope Sylvester II (1003). He made the\r\ncathedral school famous, among his pupils being the king's son and\r\nBishop Fulbert of Chartres.\r\n\r\nOne of the students in Rheims in that age was St. Bruno of Cologne,\r\nfounder of the Carthusian Order. For long years he directed the\r\ncathedral school, guiding the people during the misrule of a scandalous\r\narchbishop. A pupil of his at Rheims became Urban II, who instigated the\r\nFirst Crusade. And a century later one of his ablest and holiest sons,\r\nSt. Hugh of Avalon, built the cathedral choir of Lincoln, as well as its\r\nsmall transept, and part of the big transept--the oldest examples of\r\nEarly-English Gothic. In 1180, the archbishop of Rheims, Guillaume de\r\nChampagne, crowned as king his nephew, Philippe-Auguste. Only those\r\nshepherds of the flock who attained to canonized sainthood were honored\r\nby statues at the church entrances.\r\n\r\nThe Beau Dieu of Rheims of most benign majesty is the central image of\r\nthe transept's northern façade. Surmounting it is a Last Judgment that\r\nspeaks well for the honesty of the clerics whose pupils were the\r\nsculptors. Here at the king's own basilica, whither he came for the most\r\nbrilliant hour of his life, was sculptured a crowned monarch, as the\r\nfront figure, marching to hell, and behind him walked a bishop. No\r\npharisees were the men of the XIII century. Sin was sin, and all men\r\nwere equal before sin's punishment.\r\n\r\nThere are statues on the towers of that same north frontispiece to which\r\nnames have been given. One has been called Philippe-Auguste, and it\r\ncertainly was a portrait study, whether or not it represented the most\r\nable monarch of the feudal ages, the victor of Bouvines, who tripled the\r\narea of France and under whom was begun almost every Gothic cathedral in\r\nthe land. The name of his grandson, St. Louis, has been given to another\r\nimage. In a niche of the façade stands a charming Eve holding a very\r\nmediæval serpent.\r\n\r\nOne can merely indicate, in passing, the astounding wealth of\r\nRheims--five thousand images whose verve and fecundity are marvelous.\r\n\"If your heart is right, all creatures will be for you a book of holy\r\ndoctrine,\" so they dared to carve clown, dog, cat, or sheep on pinnacle,\r\nor in hidden nook, and their flora was as generous as their fauna. A\r\nlocal botanist has found that every leaf growing to-day by the roadsides\r\nwas reproduced in the cathedral. It was only natural that in Champagne\r\nthe vine leaf should be popular; on one of the capitals of the nave a\r\npleasant vintage scene is represented.\r\n\r\nIf the gorgeous west approaches of the Cathedral-Royal were suited for\r\nearthly pageantry, its eastern end paid homage, in holier simplicity, to\r\nthe Spiritual King. Around the exterior wall of the apse was set a guard\r\nof angels, each carrying an emblem of the Passion, or of its symbol, the\r\nMass--chalice, censer, missal, spear--and the procession met at the\r\nChrist image placed in the center of the curving wall. The ordinance\r\nwas derived from Byzantine art. Many an artist has said of the apse\r\nsculpture of Rheims that the Greeks can show no lovelier work. A few\r\nyears later, more angelic thrones, dominations, and powers were set\r\naround this, the Cathedral of the Angels. A seraphic sentry adorned each\r\nbuttress and at the same time increased its counterbutting force, and\r\nwere agents toward the swifter grounding of the load.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having touched superficially on the exterior of this\r\ninexhaustible church, let us step inside its imaged doors. On the inner\r\nwall of the three western portals is an elaborate decoration found\r\nnowhere else. Tier upon tier of statues shrined in foliage-covered\r\nniches rise to the level of the triforium. Never has a wall been more\r\nglorified both within and without. Lavish leaf ornamentation forms the\r\ncapitals of the piers. Each pier consists of a circular shaft cantoned\r\nby four lesser columns; the capitals of the latter are divided into two\r\nstories because their diameter is less--a skillful contrivance that\r\nsolves the difficulty of grouping pillars of different sizes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Angel Apse of Rheims (c. 1220)_]\r\n\r\nThe nave of Rheims was never weakened by the addition of side chapels,\r\nwhich always diminishes the integrity of an edifice. In fact, the lower\r\nwalls[120] as well as the piers were made oversolid for what they bear,\r\nsince it had not yet been learned how to apply exactly the right\r\ncounterforce to the pressure of the vaulting. Amiens was to be the first\r\nto achieve that perfect equilibrium.\r\n\r\nThe interior proportions of Rheims are harmonious; the side aisles are\r\nrelatively right with the central vessel, and the nave leads up well to\r\nthe sanctuary, which, inside and out, is beyond criticism. As a whole,\r\nhowever, the interior of this cathedral has not the slender upwardness\r\nof Amiens nor the ascetic holiness of Chartres. It stands more than it\r\nsoars. It praises the deity in another fashion than does the mystic\r\ncathedral. The keynote here is a right-minded human splendor. Robust and\r\nmajestic, this is the church for state pageants, the regal temple for\r\nnational festivals.\r\n\r\nAlas! poor battle-worn Rheims! Alas for the _bons et loyaulx Franxois de\r\nla cité de Rains!_ Has Jehanne la Purcelle forgotten her promise never\r\nto abandon you?\r\n\r\n    Mourant en plein martyre avec vivacité ...\r\n    Masquant sous sa visière une efficacité ...\r\n    Jetant toute une armée aux pieds de la prière....\r\n\r\nSo wrote the poet who fell on the field of honor, in September, 1914, of\r\nSt. Jeanne, whose martyrdom was a victory; so he might have written of\r\nRheims Cathedral. Again a sublime holocaust was needed for the saving of\r\nthe soul of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEIMS SINCE 1914\r\n\r\n     How doth the city sit solitary that was full of people. How is she\r\n     become a widow, she that was great among the nations.--JERIMIAH:\r\n     _Lamentations_.\r\n\r\n                                            Designer infinite!\r\n    Ah! must Thou char the wood e'er Thou canst limn with it?\r\n    --FRANCIS THOMPSON, _The Hound of Heaven_.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of September, 1914, after the battle of the Marne, the\r\nGermans evacuated Rheims, which they had occupied for little over a\r\nweek. Before they quitted the city, some cans of inflammable liquids,\r\nwith bundles of straw, were set on the roof of the cathedral, and there\r\nthey were found and made note of officially by Frenchmen who ascended\r\nthe towers to hang out the Red Cross flag. The destruction of Rheims\r\nCathedral was planned deliberately and in cold blood it was carried out.\r\nNo military excuse for the crime is possible, since General Joffre made\r\na formal statement that at no time were the church towers used as posts\r\nof observation.\r\n\r\nFrom the heights a few miles away the enemy opened fire on the city. It\r\nis said that Baron von Plattenburg ordered the bombardment. General von\r\nHaeringen is also cited as an executioner of Rheims Cathedral. On\r\nSeptember 17th and 18th the church was riddled with projectiles. Between\r\ndawn and sunset, on September 19th, over five hundred of them struck the\r\nmammoth church. About four o'clock on that fateful day, Saturday,\r\nSeptember 19, 1914, the timber roof caught fire from an inflammable\r\nbomb. In less than an hour flames were devouring the wooden scaffolding\r\nwhich, by ill luck, because of repairs in progress, framed part of the\r\nedifice. Fire lapped and calcined the outer walls, obliterating the\r\nkings and the angels and the saints, wiping out all the loving\r\nhandicraft of the old stonecutters. Once again molten lead ran in the\r\nstreets of Rheims. Fire lapped the sculptured screen inside the western\r\ndoors, and the lovely lavish chiseling has become a blurred, amorphous\r\nmass. Projectiles tore through the gaping windows and crashed against\r\nthe opposite walls. Some of the burning timber from the overroof fell\r\nthrough the apertures of the vault's keystones and ignited the straw\r\nspread on the pavement for the wounded German soldiers who had been left\r\nbehind when the invaders evacuated the city.\r\n\r\nLet an eyewitness relate the burning of Rheims Cathedral: \"It stood\r\nenveloped in flames, one towering flame itself. Before the outrage\r\nsomething surged unchained at the root of our being. Our cathedral! Our\r\nhearts broke as we watched its desecration. An aged woman of the city\r\nintoned solemnly: 'This will bode them no good!' ('_Ca ne leur portera\r\npas bonheur!_') We stood in groups watching with fierce anger the\r\nconflagration. We walked, we spoke, but like automatons, for our souls\r\nwere groaning with anguish. Our cathedral! _Première page de France!\r\nGeste des aïeux! Legs des siècles devenant aujourd'hui, en ce poignant\r\nmartyre, l'hostie nationale!_\" Suddenly word came that the German\r\nwounded inside the church must be saved. The archpriest of the\r\ncathedral, Canon Landrieux (to-day a bishop), called for aid from the\r\nonlookers. He was answered by angry murmurs: \"What! must we then risk\r\nour lives to save these bombarders of hospitals, these incendiaries of\r\ncathedrals?\" Then a young girl's voice rose, trembling with tears: \"_On\r\nest de France, nous autres!_\" And instantly men stepped forward to aid\r\nthe heroic priest save their enemies from the flaming furnace.\r\n\r\nPoor martyred Rheims! Its once illuminated western front is battered and\r\ncorroded past restoral, and is falling flake by flake. With a touch of\r\nthe finger the stone crumbles into dust. The towers are mutilated. One\r\nafter another the rapt and fearless angels on the buttresses have been\r\ntoppled down. As the incessant rain of fire and iron came from the\r\nnortheast, the transept's northern entranceway is wrecked--its historic\r\nstatues mere unsightly stumps. Never again will the hardy lesson of the\r\nLast Judgment be preached at the ruined portal.\r\n\r\nNo more will the triple-winged seraphim chant hosannas in the great\r\nwestern rose. No coming generations of travelers will carry away an\r\nundying memory of the sunset hour in the great church, when the western\r\ninclosure became a resplendent sheet of flame, and those who paced up\r\nand down the basilica gazed with awe at that majestic spectacle of Art\r\nand Faith. The XIII-century windows of the clearstory are pulverized;\r\nscarcely a fragment is left of the forty lancets of the nave where, in\r\nsuperimposed rows, the kings of France stood, with the archbishops who\r\nhad crowned them, big-eyed barbaric images, so intense of hue that one\r\nremembers them as blood-red rubies. The loss of the windows of Rheims\r\nhas been expressed poignantly by Pierre Loti, who spent a Sunday in\r\nOctober, 1915, in the cathedral. He found the silence of death within\r\nits ravaged walls that for centuries had echoed the music of the\r\nliturgy. Only a cold wind now and then made fitful psalmody. When it\r\nblew strongly he could hear a patter as of delicate light pearls. It was\r\nthe falling to oblivion of what still remained of the ancient windows.\r\n\r\nThe hammer of Odin and of Thor has gone on beating down relentlessly the\r\nnational church, and a Berlin poet has sung, exultantly: \"The bells\r\nsound no more in the two-towered Dom. We have closed with lead, O\r\nRheims, thy house of idolatry.\" Rheims was hated of old. In its\r\ncathedral of 1119 Calixtus II, of the blood of the Capetians, had\r\nexcommunicated the would-be autocrat of Europe, the German emperor, who\r\nhad proved himself an unnatural son, a treacherous neighbor, and one who\r\nlaid sacrilegious hands on holy things. As the pope pronounced the\r\nsentence the four hundred prelates gathered in the cathedral dashed down\r\ntheir candles. Yes, Rheims was hated.\r\n\r\nEvery check to the invader's troops in the trenches was immediately\r\nrevenged on the defenseless church. _Rheims Cathedral bombarded_ became\r\na tragically recurrent line in the war's official bulletin. On October\r\n14, 1914, a hole, meters wide, was torn in the most beautiful of Gothic\r\napses. On February 21 and 22, 1915, the bombardment surpassed in\r\nsavagery the horrors of the fateful September 19th. On March 29, 1915, a\r\nGerman airship dropped inflammable bombs on the choir, and before many\r\nmonths of this rain of iron and fire the masonry roof began to give way.\r\nDuring the half year preceding the armistice a veritable avalanche of\r\nshells fell on the stricken city, where remained only a few hundred of\r\nits hundred and thirty thousand inhabitants. From June 15 to June 28,\r\n1918, over sixteen thousand shells fell on Rheims, and, strange to tell,\r\namid it all Dubois' statue of Jeanne d'Arc mounted on her charger on the\r\ncathedral parvis stood unscathed.[121] On July 5th eight shells crashed\r\ninto the western entrances; and so on runs the sinister record.\r\n\r\n\"We wait for a chastisement equal to the crime,\" is the word of Enlart,\r\nthe archæologist. And the world's heart echoes the verdict. When on that\r\nfatal September day of 1914, the staggering almost unbelievable report\r\nfirst spread over France, \"Rheims Cathedral is in flames\"--many a strong\r\nman wept on the streets of French cities, and throughout the tragic\r\nnight of the conflagration the French soldiers, camped over the plains\r\nfor miles, watched in anguish the destruction of their patrimony, of\r\ntheir ancestress cathedral, _l'holocauste de la patrie_. In Jeanne's\r\ncentury it had taken a long and cruel war and the sacrifice of her who\r\nwas the incarnation of France to remake the stricken soul of the nation,\r\nand again an overwhelming martyrdom was needed to set right the grievous\r\n_pitié_ there was in the country of France.\r\n\r\nThe city of Rheims is to-day a shapeless mass, resembling a place\r\nwrecked by ancient barbarism. The archiepiscopal palace, whose\r\ntwo-storied chapel was built by the same hands that laid the choir\r\nstones of Notre Dame, is entirely demolished. The cathedral, though\r\nravaged irreparably, still towers above the ruined city. Had Amiens been\r\nsubjected to the same bombardment as Rheims, it would have collapsed\r\nlong ago. It is the surplus strength of Rheims' foundations, somewhat\r\ncriticized by architects, that has saved the church from utter\r\ndestruction. Notre Dame of Rheims was built for eternity.\r\n\r\nThe mystic wonder of the severed head of St. Nicaise has been repeated.\r\nImmolated Rheims has stirred anew the latent crusading blood. \"Honor\"\r\nand \"sacrifice\" and all the brave words of the days of chivalry are\r\nagain on the lips of Frenchmen, and many a scoffer has been beaten to\r\nhis knees by the same spirit which actuated the generations who built\r\nthe cathedrals and, building them, welded a nation's unity. Those who\r\ncommitted the sacrilege of Rheims forgot that when mankind is robbed of\r\na heritage it sets the criminal in the pillory of history. To-day Rheims\r\nCathedral lies wounded on the field of honor; Rheims Cathedral is\r\nforever the symbol of a people's resurrection. _À la peine!... À\r\nl'honneur!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAMIENS CATHEDRAL[122]\r\n\r\n     There have been, in humanity's story, only two great schools of\r\n     art--that of Greece, and that of the Gothic era. For only then was\r\n     expressed the ideas and the religious spirit of the peoples that\r\n     gave birth to them. The Greeks rendered the Pagan spirit, the Pagan\r\n     emotion; they left us the Parthenon. The Gothic School rendered the\r\n     Christian idea, the Christian spirit. It has left us Notre Dame of\r\n     Amiens.--ÉMILE LAMBIN.[123]\r\n\r\nThe terrors and the thunder of the World War menaced Amiens through the\r\nlong four years, but the grand doctrinal temple, almost superhuman in\r\nits majesty, was spared the fate of Rheims, Soissons, and the noble\r\nchurch of St. Martin at Ipres, begun in the same twelvemonth as itself.\r\nThe statues at the portals of Amiens have seen pass the great personages\r\nof the mediæval centuries. The kings of this world felt honored to visit\r\nthe church of Our Lady and St. Firman. Its reconciliation Mass put the\r\nseal on a treaty of goodwill between France and England, and united the\r\nEnglish ruler with his rebellious people; St. Louis, the peace maker,\r\nprayed in its sanctuary. On its very enemies it imposed veneration. When\r\nCharles le Téméraire attacked the city in 1471 he ordered his troops to\r\nrespect the cathedral.\r\n\r\nWhile the upper vaulting of Chartres was being finished and the choir of\r\nRheims was building, there was laid the first stone of Notre Dame of\r\nAmiens in 1220. Amiens is the Gothic cathedral par excellence,\r\nrecognized from the first as a masterpiece--the Parthenon of Gothic--and\r\nimmediately taken as a model. The cathedrals of Tours and of Troyes,\r\nalready begun, were now continued like the big church of Picardy. The\r\nSainte-Chapelle in Paris was modeled on the Lady chapel of Amiens. The\r\ncathedrals of Clermont, Narbonne, Rodez, and Limoges are \"daughters of\r\nAmiens.\" Its influence extended to the church of St. Sauveur at Bruges,\r\nto the cathedral of Prague, and to the choir of Cologne, the latter\r\nbeing almost a replica.[124]\r\n\r\nAmiens carried the Gothic principle of equilibrium farther than Rheims.\r\nThe aisles were made higher, the bays wider, the points of ground\r\nsupport fewer, and the piers less heavy. No energy was wasted. Each part\r\nwas made just strong enough. To go beyond this culminating point of\r\nconstructive boldness was inevitably to decline.\r\n\r\nNo one has better summed up the amplitude of this inspired church than\r\nM. Georges Durand, its latest historian, whose monograph is a model: \"A\r\nvast space inundated with air and light has here been covered by stone\r\nvaults, as light and solid as possible; those vaults have been raised to\r\na height never before attained; no longer any walls; the solidity of the\r\nedifice is assured by a play of pushes and resistances; flying\r\nbuttresses exactly meeting the necessary spot to counterbut the great\r\nvault; the system of equilibrium perfectly known, and applied with a\r\nrigor and audacity unbelievable; the least possible sharpness given to\r\ntransverse arches; the collaterals raised to a great height--all\r\ncontribute to give this interior its expression of immensity.\"\r\n\r\nAmiens is a \"triumphal chant.\" The \"vast space inclosed\" produces an\r\nimpression that is confounding. When first you step inside the western\r\ndoors of Amiens, you pause in awe. The emotion felt has the efficacy of\r\na prayer.\r\n\r\nThe edifice is prodigious and appears so; only St. Sophia, Cologne\r\nCathedral, and St. Peter's at Rome cover larger areas. Now in St.\r\nPeter's each detail was enlarged in proportion to the giant scale\r\nchosen; thus, a cherub would have a thigh the size of an elephant's. The\r\nresult is that the great church appears less than its real size. The\r\nmethod of the mediæval architect was precisely opposite. He saw no\r\nadvantage in making his edifice appear smaller than it really was. He\r\nobserved that no matter how big a tree might grow, its leaves were no\r\nlarger than those on smaller trees. The mediæval architect took for his\r\nscale of measurement the height of man. His doorways were made for man\r\nto walk under. In the bases of his piers, in the triforium arches, in\r\nthe normal size of his sculpted flora and fauna, he recalled to the eye\r\nthe scale of a man, his chosen _échelle_: \"And he measured the wall\r\nthereof ... the measure of a man, which is of an angel.\"[125] No matter\r\nhow large a Gothic church might be, the statues decorating it did not\r\nincrease in scale. To those who prefer a cathedral of the north there\r\nwill always seem to be a touch of the artificial, of the _tour de force_\r\nin St. Peter's.\r\n\r\nThe name of the master mind who designed the cathedral of Picardy was\r\nRobert de Lusarches, recorded in a labyrinth formerly in the nave's\r\npavement, as were his two successors, Thomas de Cormont and his son\r\nRenaud. The occasion for a new structure was the fire of 1218 which\r\npartly destroyed the Romanesque cathedral. As its old choir was\r\npreserved sufficiently to serve for a while longer, the new cathedral\r\nwas begun by the nave, not the usual procedure. The nave rose in one\r\nsupreme effort; from start to finish its plan never deviated. It has\r\nbeen taken as the typical masterpiece. \"The façade of Paris, the tower\r\nof Chartres, the sculpture of Rheims, the nave of Amiens\" is a popular\r\nsumming up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Transept of Amiens Cathedral (1220-1280)_]\r\n\r\nBy 1236 the nave of Amiens was finished, whereupon the Romanesque choir\r\nwas replaced by a Gothic one whose plan had been drawn by Robert de\r\nLusarches at the same time with that of the nave. His feeling for\r\nproportion was unfaltering; the relation between every part of his\r\nchurch is perfect. The interior elevation in three vertical stories was\r\nto become classic--a pier arcade--which is one-third of the entire\r\nheight, and of the remaining upper wall a clearstory which occupies\r\ntwo-thirds and a triforium one-third. The church is three times as wide\r\nas the side aisle is high, and height and span correlate with length.\r\nSubtlety of calculation is seen everywhere. The perspective view became\r\na kind of classic type. As you gaze down the church toward the curving\r\neast wall which closes the vista, you see beneath the pier arcades of\r\nthe _sanctum sanctorum_ the windows of the apse chapels behind; they\r\nappear to fill the apertures symmetrically, whereas at Beauvais, where\r\nthe side aisle is exceedingly high, the windows of the chapels rise to\r\nmerely half the height of the pier arches. The cathedrals of Tours and\r\nClermont followed the more satisfactory arrangement of Amiens.\r\n\r\nIn the last days of Gothic architecture the dislike of the horizontal\r\nline was to be carried to such an extent that even the capitals, which\r\nthe custom of all nations had approved for three thousand years, were\r\neliminated. At Amiens a sane balance was kept. Under its triforium runs\r\na deeply carved band of foliage broken only at the triumphal arches of\r\nthe transept-crossing. Only there does the ascending line rise\r\nunobstructed from pavement to vault. And yet no church ever soared more\r\nconfidently. The very hall-mark of genius is Amiens' strong horizontal\r\nleaf garland--just the needed touch to give variety to regularity as\r\ngrandiose as this. In the nave the frieze was cut before the posing of\r\nthe stones, but in the choir the sculpture was done _in situ_.\r\n\r\nThe fenestration of this cathedral of St. Louis' reign shows the\r\nnational art in its prime. The glazed triforium is a kind of pedestal\r\nfor the clearstory, with which it is bound in a single composition by\r\nmeans of continuous mullions. The original glass was of the\r\nSainte-Chapelle type, made by the Paris school which led in the second\r\nhalf of the XIII century, and were it still in existence the interior of\r\nAmiens would be a gorgeous sight. Only vestiges have survived; in some\r\nof the choir chapels are patchwork panels of ancient fragments. No one\r\ndenies that the light enters this cathedral too profusely for the mystic\r\nseclusion beloved of the soul.\r\n\r\nThe prelate who laid the foundation stone of Amiens in 1220 was Evrard\r\nde Fouilloy, cousin of that archbishop of the great house of Joinville\r\nwho was a builder at Rheims. Intimate with Innocent III, connoisseur in\r\nnotable men, the bishop of Amiens was one of the many building prelates\r\nwho attended the Lateran Council whose séances must often have appeared\r\nlike an _Amis des Cathédrales_ reunion. Bishop Evrard's splendid bronze\r\ntomb, cast at one flow, escaped the smelting pot of the Revolution, and\r\nwith that of his successor, Geoffrey d'Eu, who chanted the first Mass in\r\nhis cathedral in 1236, the year of his death, is now placed under the\r\npier arcades of the nave. \"Here lies Evrard,\" runs the inscription, \"a\r\nman compassionate to the afflicted, the widows' protector, the orphans'\r\nguardian, who fed the people, who laid the foundations of this\r\nstructure, to whose care the city was given.\" The hand of the bishop is\r\nraised in a grave gesture of power. The image of Geoffrey d'Eu is less\r\npersonal. \"Bright-shining man of Eu,\" runs his epitaph, \"by whom the\r\nthrone of Amiens rose into immensity.\" The saintly bishop used to\r\nencourage even the beggars to give their penny toward raising the new\r\nhouse of God.\r\n\r\nBy 1245 bells were placed in the western towers; then came a lull in the\r\nwork, from 1247 to 1257, for the bishop had accompanied St. Louis to the\r\nholy wars. Louis IX was in Amiens on several occasions and his\r\nSainte-Chapelle at Paris proved his admiration for the classic church.\r\nAs the XIII century closed, a chapel was added to Amiens by her bishop,\r\nthe learned Guillaume de Mâcon, a personal friend of St. Louis, and\r\npresent at his death in Tunis, 1270. The son and successor of Louis IX\r\nsent Guillaume to Rome to solicit his father's canonization. During the\r\nXIV century other side chapels were added, and in the one erected by\r\nBishop La Grange, from 1373 to 1375, appeared for the first time in\r\nFrance some of the characteristics of Flamboyant Gothic--the flame\r\ntracery and ramified vaulting. As early as 1270, however, Amiens had\r\nmade a sporadic use of supplementary ribs, in the square over the\r\ntransept-crossing, employing them there, no doubt, in order to break up\r\nthe immense expanses of infilling.\r\n\r\nThough the cathedral of Amiens has lost its stained glass, it has\r\nretained that other glory of decorative art--its sculpture. The three\r\nwestern entrance arches, in nine orders, are sovereign compositions.\r\nProbably as a scheme of dogmatic theology Amiens is even more complete\r\nthan Chartres or Rheims. The main façade, with its strong buttress lines\r\nunbroken from ground to tower, would be the grandest of all the Gothic\r\nfrontispieces had it been completed as first planned. But only in its\r\nlower stories is it of the XIII century, and the towers scarcely rise\r\nabove the enormous parallelogram.\r\n\r\nAt the trumeau of the central door stands _le Beau Dieu_ of Amiens, of\r\nstronger personality than that of Rheims, a Christ of the West more than\r\nthe East. \"He is the master, wise, steadfast, fraternal, with the\r\npatience and the human sympathy that comprehend man's eternal\r\nweaknesses.\"[126] He treads on monsters that symbolize Satan and Sin:\r\n\"Thou shalt walk upon the asp and the basilisk; the lion and the dragon\r\nshalt thou trample under foot.\"[127] About him stand the best loved of\r\nall the saints, the apostles--plain, primitive men in whose upturned\r\nforeheads shines the serenity of certitude. We are His witnesses, they\r\nseem to be saying, and our testimony we sealed _usque ad sanguinem_:\r\n\"That which we have seen and have heard we declare unto you....\" \"We\r\nwere eyewitnesses of His greatness....\" \"This Voice we heard brought\r\nfrom heaven....\" \"These things we write to you that you may rejoice and\r\nyour joy be full.\" The prophets and patriarchs at Amiens' portals lack\r\nthe assurance of joy which shines in the faces of the humble men chosen\r\nfor the hierarchy of the New Law; the earlier ones had not themselves\r\nseen and heard and touched.\r\n\r\nNever was the meaning of the Messiah's coming set forth more sublimely\r\nthan in this archetype cathedral. The soul of the Middle Ages had\r\nbrooded over the Gospels till it had pierced to their spiritual sense.\r\n\"The house of the Lord built upon the foundation of the apostles and\r\nprophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone in whom all\r\nthe building being framed together, growing up into an holy temple in\r\nthe Lord.\"[128]\r\n\r\nWhen the apostles were placed at the cathedral doors, the tradition was\r\nto have St. Peter stand to the right of his Master, and St. Paul to the\r\nleft; the latter was substituted for Matthias, elected to Judas' place.\r\nSt. Peter, tonsured, carried the key and a cross; his beard was short\r\nand curly. St. Paul bore a sword, since his Roman citizenship had saved\r\nhim from death by crucifixion; he was represented with a bald forehead\r\nand a long beard. St. Andrew carried the peculiar-shaped cross on which\r\nhe died; St. Bartholomew a knife, emblem of his martyrdom.\r\n\r\nAt the western doors of Amiens is an Annunciation group in which the\r\nVirgin is the prototype of the gentle _Ancilla Domini_ at Rheims. The\r\nSt. Elizabeth of the Visitation group is a noble aged woman; the St.\r\nSimeon of the Presentation has been called the _Nunc dimittis_ in\r\nperson. Local saints are in a position of honor at the right-hand door,\r\nthe chief here being St. Firman, the first bishop of Amiens, and the\r\npioneer who preached the Word in Picardy, where he was martyred in 289.\r\nOn his tomb rose the first cathedral of the city. His statue at the\r\ntrumeau is a masterpiece of its period.\r\n\r\nIn his _Bible of Amiens_,[129] Ruskin gives enlightening\r\ninterpretations of the quatrefoils adorning the wall under the big\r\nimages at the western entrance. Little genre studies of agricultural\r\nlife typify the seasons, and the vices and virtues are rendered with\r\nmovement and subtlety. There is a connection between certain of the\r\nsmall bas-reliefs and the large statues standing above them.\r\n\r\nAbout 1288 they carved the images at the transept's southern portal.\r\nFifty years had elapsed since the making of the western entrance, and\r\nalready the early reverential awe had passed away. Our Lady is now shown\r\nas a radiant young matron whose smile is somewhat mannered, but to call\r\nthe charming _vierge dorée_ \"the soubrette of Picardy,\" as did Ruskin,\r\nis an absurd exaggeration. The apostles are no longer of the ideal type.\r\nThey are mediæval schoolmen, debating some point of dialectics.\r\n\r\nEach century was to add to the sculpture of Amiens. André Beauneveu, an\r\nillustrious French-Flemish master, made buttress statues of Charles V\r\nand his sons, realistic portrait work. The king was one of the four\r\nValois brothers who were, with the Avignon popes, the chief art patrons\r\nof the XIV century. As Amiens Cathedral suffered comparatively little\r\nduring the two cataclysms which emptied the churches of France, it is\r\nstill a museum of treasures. When, in 1562, the Huguenots, sword in\r\nhand, rushed into the church to shatter the altars, the town's tocsin\r\nsounded and the citizens assembled in such numbers that they saved their\r\nchurch. Again, during the Revolution, when brutal soldiery began to\r\nmutilate the choir screen's groups, the women of Amiens who lived about\r\nthe cathedral lustily beat the vandals with chairs. Of course the\r\nRevolution set up here the usual altar with its living Goddess of\r\nReason, Marat's bust was honored, and over the portal was inscribed the\r\ngrandiloquent boast: \"Fanaticism is destroyed: Truth triumphs.\"\r\n\r\nThe tombs, bas-reliefs, and paintings were left intact, as well as the\r\nfamous carved stalls finished in 1522. In the choir-screen sculpture of\r\nXVI-century Gothic the Renaissance had only just begun to appear. St.\r\nFirman's mission was related quaintly--no prudery shown in the scene of\r\nthe baptism of Amiens' first Christians. The life of St. John the\r\nBaptist was set forth because crusaders had brought his relics to this\r\nchurch from Constantinople. The tourist guide enjoys leading his clients\r\nbehind Amiens' sanctuary to show them a plump little cupid weeping a\r\nmarble tear over the tomb of some good canon who founded a local\r\norphanage. M. Durand remarks that for one who appreciates the\r\nmagnificent bronze tombs of the bishop-builders, or the realistic\r\nlate-Gothic groups of the choir screen, there are ten who are moved by\r\nthat banal little _ange pleurant_.\r\n\r\nIn the transept are some marble slabs inscribed with the names of the\r\npresidents of a religious-literary association called Puy-Notre-Dame.\r\nSuch Puys (from podium, or platform) were poetic contests that sprang up\r\nin the XIV century, with the disappearance of the wandering minstrels,\r\nand they led in turn to a real literary movement.[130] At Amiens it was\r\nthe custom each year for a new picture in honor of Notre Dame to be\r\npresented to her church, and at the festival a poem was read in her\r\npraise. Eventually statues were substituted for pictures, which explains\r\nthe wealth of XVII-century sculpture in the side chapels and aisles of\r\nAmiens Cathedral. A number of the ancient paintings have been placed in\r\nthe Museum of the city, whose walls have been embellished by Puvis de\r\nChavannes' _Ave Picardia nutrix_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSix of the Lesser Great Cathedrals: Bourges, Beauvais, Troyes, Tours,\r\nLyons, Le Mans\r\n\r\n     Every work of art truly beautiful and sublime throws the soul into\r\n     a gracious or serious reverie that lifts it toward the Infinite.\r\n     Art of itself is essentially moral and religious, since it\r\n     expresses everywhere in its manifestation the eternal beauty, or\r\n     else it is false to its own law, to its own genius.\r\n\r\n     --VICTOR COUSIN, _Du vrai, du beau, et du bien_.\r\n\r\n\r\nScattered over France are a number of cathedrals that would stand in the\r\nfirst rank in any other land but one in which were such supreme churches\r\nas Chartres, Rheims, and Amiens. It is convenient to group here six of\r\nthese lesser Great Cathedrals, since they will not fall properly within\r\nthe coming four chapters, which deal with the regional schools of\r\nNormandy, Burgundy, the Midi, and Plantagenet Gothic.\r\n\r\nAccording to the classification used by M. Lefèvre-Pontalis, there are\r\nsix schools of Gothic architecture in France. Their differences lie in\r\nsecondary characteristics such as ground-plan, ramifications of ribs,\r\nand the form of piers, window tracery, and ornamentations. Of the\r\nIle-de-France and Champagne schools we have already gained some idea in\r\ntracing the first steps of the national art, and in following its\r\nhighest development at Paris, Rheims, and Amiens. Of the six cathedrals\r\nhere grouped that of Beauvais belongs to the Ile-de-France Picard school\r\nand that of Troyes to the Gothic of Champagne. But the four\r\nothers--Bourges, Tours, Lyons, and Le Mans--show the influences of two\r\nor more schools and therefore fit more reasonably into this\r\nheterogeneous chapter. In speaking of Gothic schools it is well to\r\nrecall that in the Flamboyant development there were no distinct\r\nregional groups. A similar Gothic style was used in the Midi as in\r\nNormandy, in Picardy as in Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThough not of the greatest, these six churches are splendid monuments.\r\nWith hesitation one places such a cathedral as Bourges in a secondary\r\ngroup. Had Beauvais and Le Mans been completed on the same scale as\r\ntheir grandiose choirs, they would stand with the foremost. At Troyes\r\nare windows, of the same epochs as the stones framing them, that for\r\nsplendor are second only to those of Chartres and Bourges. The cathedral\r\nof Tours is the personification of the equipoise of Touraine's art, and\r\nits storied windows are notable. The metropolitan church of Lyons\r\npossesses a grave individuality of the most singular interest, and its\r\nwindows, too, are masterpieces.\r\n\r\nDuring an astonishing century--roughly speaking from 1170 to\r\n1270--France built about eighty Gothic cathedrals, and more than three\r\nhundred fine churches. And the miracle is that each had its own distinct\r\npersonality, which etches itself clearly on the traveler's mind. Such\r\nwas the super-abounding joy of creation in the golden age of the\r\nnational art that no two churches are alike.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF BOURGES[131]\r\n\r\n     One goes before the Lord's altar, one bends the knee, one stays\r\n     there in an attitude of prostrate humility, and _perhaps_, in it\r\n     all, one has not rendered to God a single homage. Why? Because\r\n     religion does not consist of inclinations of the body, or of\r\n     modesty of the eyes, but of humbleness of spirit, and not for an\r\n     instant has the spirit been one with those demonstrations of\r\n     respect and adoration.\r\n\r\n     One visits the hospitals and prisons, one consoles the afflicted,\r\n     one tends the sick and helps the poor, and _perhaps_ the very one\r\n     who displays in all this the most assiduity and zeal is he who\r\n     possesses the least Christian mercy. Why? Because he is carried on\r\n     by a certain natural activity, or an entirely human pity touches\r\n     him, or is it any other motive, except God, that leads him.--_On\r\n     True and False Piety_, BOURDALOUE (1632-1704; born in Bourges).\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. Étienne stands on a slight hill in the center of\r\nBourges, and is a landmark for forty miles over the Berry plains that\r\nare the tranquil heart of France. The best architectural view of it is\r\nobtained from the park once attached to the archbishop's palace and said\r\nto have been laid out by Le Nôtre, master of this type of cold\r\ndistinction which is so eminently French. As the entire south flank of\r\nthe church is exposed to view there, the absence of a transept is what\r\nfirst strikes the attention. Bourges is the only XIII-century cathedral\r\nwithout the extended arms of the cross. Had it a transept it might\r\nappear short, whereas now its four hundred feet of length make the most\r\nimposing effect.\r\n\r\nBourges, Paris, Troyes, and Clermont are the only cathedrals with double\r\naisles about choir and nave. Bourges is exceptional in that the inner\r\naisle is twice as high as the outer--so high that it possesses its own\r\ntriforium and clearstory; so high that the pier arches around the middle\r\nchurch rise to more than half the height of the edifice. Indeed, many an\r\nEnglish cathedral could stand under the pier arches of Bourges. Each\r\npillar is encircled by eight shafts--an arrangement that accentuates its\r\nloftiness. It may be claimed that there is over-emphasis in a procession\r\nof such giant columns about the interior of a church, and that there is\r\nsomething spectacular in a colonnade of such stupendous arches.\r\nCertainly the main clearstory is dwarfed by comparison, and the\r\ncontrast in height between inner and outer aisle is too violent. Bourges\r\nmust pass as a superb experiment rather than the restrained achievement\r\nfrom which emanates a school. Subsequent architects preferred to take as\r\nmodel the more classic division of Amiens' interior wall elevation.\r\n\r\nNone the less is this most original basilica magnificently and\r\nromantically beautiful. Upon entering the church for the first time one\r\nfeels the gripping sensation of beholding a thing audacious and\r\ngigantic. And yet the impression conveyed is not that of overweening\r\npride. There is reverence here. Bishop Durandus tells us that the piers\r\nof a church are the bishops and doctors who sustain the temple of God by\r\ntheir doctrines, that the length of a church representeth fortitude\r\nwhich patiently endureth till it attain heaven; its breadth, charity;\r\nits height, courage that despiseth prosperity and adversity, hoping to\r\nsee the gladness of the Lord in the land of the living. The windows are\r\nhospitality with cheerfulness, and tenderness with charity. They are\r\nHoly Scriptures which expel the wind and the rain--that is, all things\r\nhurtful--but transmit the light of the true Sun--that is, God--into the\r\nhearts of the faithful.[132] So wrote the wise old XIII-century Midi\r\nbishop for whom the whole world and everything in it were symbols.\r\n\r\nSound doctrine, fortitude, and warm protecting hospitality--such are\r\nqualities supremely understood of Bourges. There is awe in this church\r\nand there is magic. Of the boundless imagination of dreams are certain\r\nsunset aspects here, when from the wide western window of Jean de Berry\r\ngleams of light strike athwart these vast arches of wonderland, across\r\nthese sixty big pillars of stone, and night-time hours--during the May\r\nevening services of Our Lady--when the great church as in fearsome\r\nmeditation is shrouded in shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Apse of Bourges (1200-1225)_]\r\n\r\nSome four or five cathedrals have stood, in turn, on the same site which\r\nwas close by the Gallo-Roman city walls. For the early Christians\r\nwere despised as pariahs, and allowed to build only on the outskirts of\r\ncities, until the edict of Constantine permitted them to exercise their\r\nreligion with honor. All over France churches are to be found abutting\r\non the ancient ramparts of towns. Of the early cathedrals of Bourges\r\nonly the core of the present crypt remains. From the Romanesque edifice\r\nimmediately preceding the present cathedral come its XII-century side\r\nportals.\r\n\r\nThere are strong analogies between the ground-plan of St. Étienne of\r\nBourges and that of Notre Dame of Paris, especially if one recalls that\r\nthe cathedral of Paris, as first designed, possessed no transept.\r\nProbably the plans of both were made at the same time, but the work in\r\nthe capital of the royal demesne started immediately in 1163; hence it\r\nretained the galleries over the side aisles--a Romanesque\r\ntradition--whereas, at Bourges the actual building began only in the\r\nlast decade of the XII century, when such tribunes were passing out of\r\nvogue. Bourges thereupon undertook to modify its first design, and it\r\ntried the startling experiment of making an inner aisle whose height\r\ncomprised both aisle and tribune.\r\n\r\nThe crypt of Bourges,[133] one of the most spacious in France, was begun\r\nby Archbishop Henri de Sully (1184-99), brother of Bishop Eudes who\r\nhelped build the west façade of Paris Cathedral. When Henri died, the\r\ndecision was left to his brother in Paris, as to which of three\r\nCistercian abbots should be the succeeding archbishop in Bourges. The\r\nnomination fell to St. Guillaume Berruyer (1199-1208) of the house of\r\nNevers, whose counts had built the admirable Romanesque St. Étienne in\r\nthat city. Guillaume had watched both Paris and Soissons' cathedrals\r\nrising; he had been a monk in Pontigny, whose church was the earliest\r\nGothic venture in Burgundy, and he was abbot of Châalis, where the\r\nchurch also was Primary Gothic. This holy Cistercian was loath to leave\r\nhis cloister, and always wore his white robe and fasted like a genuine\r\nson of St. Bernard. In his face shone his purity of soul, and it is said\r\nthat his manner was merry.\r\n\r\nOnly a saint could have made the ambulatory of Bourges, a place apart\r\nfrom the world's fret, fashioned for meditative prayer, its walls hung\r\nwith gospel parables of mosaic glass. It is thought that while the new\r\nGothic choir was building, services were held in the Romanesque\r\ncathedral, which may have been partly open to the elements, since St.\r\nGuillaume caught a chill in it while preaching, from the effects of\r\nwhich he died in 1208. Ten years later, the first ceremony held in the\r\ncompleted choir was for his canonization; without the usual process of\r\ninvestigation the pope declared him a saint.\r\n\r\nFrom 1236 to 1260, a nephew of St. William's, Blessed Philippe Berruyer,\r\nwas archbishop of Bourges and carried forward the nave; and the saint's\r\ngreat-niece, the Countess Matilda of Nevers, contributed generously.\r\nBourges commemorated her saintly bishops in the clearstory of her inner\r\naisle. The window wherein St. Guillaume is pictured shows his niece as\r\nthe donor.\r\n\r\nNever was monument set on a more majestic base than the choir end of\r\nBourges. There the crypt stands above the ground, owing to the slope of\r\nthe land. The chevet of St. Étienne is incomparable. In every part of\r\nthe edifice good mason work was done, save in the upper vaults, where\r\nthe necessity of economy led to skimping. It is apparent that, as the\r\neastern curve of the cathedral was rising, the architect modified his\r\nplan. In his apse walls he inserted small chapels, each standing on two\r\ncolumns and an engaged shaft and each roofed by a stone pyramid. Not\r\nonly does the circlet of little shrines add to the beauty of the chevet,\r\nbut each chapel serves the practical purpose of a buttress. That they\r\nwere afterthoughts is proved by the ambulatory windows not being set\r\nsymmetrically over the crypt windows. However, the chapels must have\r\nbeen added during the building of the procession path, because the\r\nlatter's vaulting shows no sign of reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Bourges is not well documented. Only by a study of the\r\nstones themselves can it be dated. Its eastern end was building during\r\nthe first part of the XIII century; in 1266 the chapter contributed\r\ntoward the works, their donations being used probably for the completion\r\nof the nave. At the end of the XIII century porches were added to the\r\nside doors retained from the Romanesque cathedral. Work continued on the\r\nwest façade during the early part of the XIV century, but when, in 1324,\r\nSt. Étienne was dedicated, it had been completed in its main parts for\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\nThis makes the west front of Bourges about a century younger than its\r\napse. The five deeply recessed portals correspond to its five aisles,\r\nand the western towers are set clear of the aisles, as at Rouen; that to\r\nthe southwest is now braced by a flying buttress and detached buttress\r\npile. In 1506 the northwest tower collapsed. It was rebuilt by alms,\r\ngiven as thank-offering for the privilege of eating butter during Lent,\r\nhence its name Tour de Beurre. Such butter towers may be called the XVI\r\ncentury's method of charity bazaar to raise money for church repairs.\r\nDuring the heyday of Gothic, the fervent layman gave voluntarily, asking\r\nfor no return, and in that spirit rose the _clocher vieux_ at Chartres.\r\nCompare that sublime monument with the elegant, mundane late-Gothic\r\n\"butter towers\" of France, and you comprehend how inevitably the spirit\r\nof builders reveals itself in the work of their hands.\r\n\r\nOf the five western doors of Bourges, only the central one is wholly of\r\nthe XIII century (c. 1260-75). Its representation of the Last Judgment,\r\nadjudged to be the best ever set up at a cathedral door, the _Dies Iræ_\r\nwarning in stone, is derived from Job, St. Paul, St. Matthew, and the\r\nApocalypse. In the upper zone Christ is enthroned; in the lower is shown\r\nthe arising of the dead from their tombs. Between these scenes is the\r\nsplendid panel of the Judgment, with the stately archangel as its\r\ncentral figure, holding the scales of justice. To his left malign demons\r\nseize on the damned to plunge them into the jaws of the Leviathan\r\ndescribed in Job. To his right the blessed ones smile with complacency\r\nas they move toward Paradise, here represented by a\r\nhieroglyphic--supposed to be Abraham's bosom, out of which peep some\r\nlittle souls smuggled safely away.[134] St. Peter stands at the gates of\r\nParadise, holding the keys, a doctrinal symbol of his power to bind and\r\nto loose, until in time popular fancy pictured him as the actual\r\ngatekeeper of heaven. Among the elect is represented a king holding the\r\nflower of sanctity, probably meant for St. Louis. Beside the king is a\r\ncord-girdled monk--hence the name \"cordeliers\" for Franciscans--showing\r\nhow popular was the new Order.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the north tower caused the ruin of the portals near it, and\r\nwhen rebuilt in the XVI century an iconographic error was made which\r\nwould have been impossible with the trained scholastics of an earlier\r\nday--the mother of the Saviour was placed on his left, instead of in the\r\nseat of honor on his right. In the fatal year 1562, when from end to end\r\nof France the churches were mutilated, the Calvinists attacked the\r\nportal images of Bourges and flung the carven stones into the breaches\r\nof the town walls. They went so far as to mine the giant piers in order\r\nthat the great edifice might totter to its fall; but happily their\r\ncontrol of the city was cut short, or the tragedy of Orléans might have\r\nbeen enacted.[135]\r\n\r\nBourges is a chosen spot for stained glass, second only to Chartres.\r\nStudents have made the study of its windows a lifetime enthusiasm.\r\nNowhere can the epochs of the vitrine art from the XII to the XVII\r\ncentury be more easily studied. The school of St. Denis, however, is not\r\nrepresented. Two small panels, now set in a window beside the south\r\nportal, are earlier in date than Suger's windows; their flesh tone is\r\npurplish; perhaps they are the oldest colored glass extant in France.\r\n\r\nOf the XIII-century school of Chartres are the twenty and more lancets\r\nin the ambulatory, legend-medallion windows ranking with the best ever\r\nmade. They repeat some of the themes used by the artists at Chartres,\r\nsuch as the parables of the Prodigal Son, presented by the tanners, and\r\nof the Good Samaritan, which latter lancet at Bourges is an exception in\r\nhaving its story begin at the top. Ancient windows are to be read\r\nusually from the bottom upward. The first window in the choir aisle, as\r\nyou enter it from the north, shows the beggar Lazarus despised and\r\nsuffering on earth, then carried by angels to Abraham's bosom, wherein\r\n(in the topmost medallion) he sits cozily ensconsed, but Dives, the bad\r\nrich man, is snatched by demons from his earthly scenes of plenty and\r\nthrust into hell. The lancet which, at Bourges, is devoted to the\r\nApocalypse, is held to be a subtle commentary on the vision of Patmos.\r\nTo the fifth large window of the ambulatory, called the New Alliance,\r\nthe Jesuit fathers, Cahier and Martin, have devoted over a hundred\r\npages--a veritable treatise on symbolism--in their monumental study of\r\nthe earlier stained glass in this church. \"Prophecies in action,\" our\r\nfriend Joinville called the prefiguring of the New Law by the Old, so\r\npopular during the Middle Ages. New Alliance windows are to be found in\r\nvarious cathedrals--their theme being the substitution of Gentiles for\r\nJews by the merit of the Cross.[136] The guild of butchers was the donor\r\nof this abstract doctrinal window of Bourges.\r\n\r\nThe only break in the XIII-century glass of the choir aisle is in the\r\naxis chapel, where the windows--of the XVI-century Renaissance--belonged\r\noriginally to the Sainte-Chapelle of the ducal palace that once existed\r\nin Bourges; other windows from the same source have been reset in the\r\ncathedral's crypt. The small scenes at the base of each lancet--the\r\nsignatures as they are called--show that here, as at Chartres, the\r\nlarger number of these priceless treasures of art were donated by the\r\nlittle people of the Lord--carpenters, weavers, coopers, money changers.\r\nA window given by the stonecutters, in the choir aisle of Bourges, is\r\ndevoted to St. Thomas, the apostle, patron of builders. Bourges and\r\nChartres afford the best opportunity for a more intimate study of the\r\nlegends and symbols then most popular. Here, as at Chartres, the _Golden\r\nLegend_ should be one's inseparable companion.\r\n\r\nIn the high windows of the middle choir the apostles are ranged on one\r\nside of Sancta Maria, and the prophets on the other--another of the many\r\ncontrasts of the Old and New Testaments. The nave's clearstory is\r\nchiefly XIII-century grisaille. The XIV-century artists, in their desire\r\nfor more light, gave up the profound colors of their mosaic-like windows\r\nfor that coldly elegant phase of the vitrine art, when the use of white\r\nwas carried to excess and each figure set in its own panel was pictured\r\nlike a statue with architectural niche and dais.\r\n\r\nAbout 1370 Duke Jean of Berry, born connoisseur like his brothers\r\nCharles V, Philippe of Burgundy, and the Duke of Anjou, presented to\r\nBourges Cathedral its immense western window. Before the Medici, this\r\nValois prince collected cameos and medals and bric-à-brac. Among the\r\ntwenty castles he built were those of Poitiers, Riom, and Bourges, on\r\nwhich were employed the noted Flamboyant Gothic architects, the\r\nDammartin brothers. When the Sainte-Chapelle of the palace in Bourges\r\nwas destroyed (1759), the duke's tomb, which his nephew Charles VI had\r\nordered of Jean de Cambrai (1477-83), was brought to the cathedral. The\r\nsarcophagus was once surrounded by alabaster statuettes, some of which\r\nare in the Museum. The arrangement of mourners came from his brother's\r\nworld-famous tomb in Dijon. In his old age the spendthrift, unstable\r\nJean de Berry married the very youthful Jeanne de Boulogne, and kneeling\r\nimages of both duke and duchess have been placed on either side of the\r\nentrance to the axis chapel of the cathedral. Apparently art-loving John\r\nof France was in person the homeliest of men. The Revolution damaged\r\nthese images, which were restored by means of drawings made of them by\r\nHolbein in the time when Bourges was a Mecca for the artists of Europe.\r\nSome of Duke Jean's friends presented early XV-century windows to the\r\nside chapels of Bourges Cathedral. His physician, Aligret, gave one.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Years' War put a stop to the accumulation of art treasures\r\nin the metropolitan church. When Charles VII, \"the little king of\r\nBourges,\" as the English had dubbed him ironically, went with the\r\nvictorious Maid of Orleans to be crowned king at Rheims, his gentle\r\nqueen, Marie of Anjou, stayed in Bourges with her mother, Yolande of\r\nAragon. Marie's brother, then a youth under Jeanne's command, was to\r\nbecome the good King René of history. To Bourges Jeanne herself came\r\nlater. She lodged with an estimable widow of the town who, years\r\nafterward, during the inquest conducted for the Maid's rehabilitation,\r\nbore testimony to the young girl's simple goodness. She told how\r\ngallantly Jeanne mounted a horse and how adroitly she managed a lance so\r\nthat \"everyone was in admiration of her, for no knight could have done\r\nbetter.\"[137]\r\n\r\nThen when \"_Jehanne la bonne Lorraine_,\" as Villon called her, had given\r\nFrance a new soul, when the blight of the Great Schism of the West was\r\nover, and France accepted the same spiritual chief as the remainder of\r\nEurope, there came about the energetic, happy, restless manifestation of\r\nart which we call Flamboyant Gothic. Bourges then possessed a Mæcenas in\r\nthe person of a merchant (son of a tradesman of the city) whose ships\r\ncovered the sea. Jacques Coeur, from 1443 to 1452, built himself, in\r\nhis native town, the finest burgher's house in France, to see which René\r\nof Anjou--great-nephew of Jean of Berry--came especially to Bourges. Its\r\nwalls were carved with quaint devices and images,[138] and, like Van\r\nEyck's, were the charming little angels painted on its chapel vaults. No\r\ncivic monument in the land excels it; it ranks as the best with Rouen's\r\nPalais de Justice and the Hôtel Cluny at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe same merchant-prince built in Bourges Cathedral a private chapel for\r\nhis family, and beside it a rich Flamboyant Gothic sacristy. The\r\nAnnunciation window in the chapel (1450) is held to be the best glass of\r\nits century, uniting the better drawing of the later day with a plain,\r\nfirm, general design. The face of the Angel Gabriel has been said to be\r\na portrait of Jacques Coeur. St. James is represented in pilgrim garb\r\nbecause of the fame of his shrine at Santiago Compostela. It is thought\r\nthat Jacques Coeur donated the row of richly damasked windows in the\r\nwest façade beneath Jean of Berry's big sheet of glass, made fifty years\r\nearlier. Colors have become richer and the figures show a tendency to\r\nescape from the rigid attitude of statues, but not yet has absolute\r\ncongruity between the hues been achieved.\r\n\r\nJacques Coeur was not to be buried in the chapel he had prepared. He\r\nserved the same master who had let the Maid of Orleans perish at Rouen\r\nwithout striking a blow to save her. With money provided by the\r\nmerchant-banker of Bourges, Charles VII had reconquered Normandy, but he\r\nlet the estate of his faithful servant be rapaciously confiscated\r\nwithout a trial, and left him to languish in prison for two years before\r\nbeing banished from the kingdom by the mockery of a law process. Jacques\r\nCoeur died in exile in 1461, but his good name was exonerated, and his\r\nson Jean, archbishop of Bourges, was buried in the cathedral's choir.\r\nThe merchant-prince's chapel passed with his mansion into the hands of\r\nthe Laubespine family, whose kneeling statues now adorn it.\r\n\r\nWith the XVI century there opened another golden period of the vitrine\r\nart in Bourges. A local master, Jean Lecuyer, won fame. He made the\r\nTullier window (1532) in the tenth bay (south) of the cathedral. The\r\ndonor, Canon Tullier, and his father, mother, and various ecclesiastic\r\nrelatives, are being presented by their patron saints to a\r\ndistinguished-looking Madonna. The architectural background shows what\r\nheadway the foreign Renaissance had made in France, though the chief\r\nfigures are still true to French traditions. The colors are faultlessly\r\nbalanced and certain exquisite half-tones are noticeable. In the upper\r\npanels, in a fair blue sky, are entrancing little angels giving a\r\ncelestial concert, fiddling, beating a drum, singing with all their\r\nhearts, for this is the shrine built by St. William, who knew how to be\r\nholy and merry as well.\r\n\r\nThe Tullier light has been called the loveliest of XVI-century windows.\r\nAnd yet no one can deny that enamel painting on glass was a\r\ndeterioration of the art. The old masters had followed a sounder\r\ntradition when they subordinated their windows to their architecture,\r\nmaking them an integral part of it, and not merely isolated painted\r\npictures. Jean Lecuyer also composed the window (1518) relating the\r\nlives of St. Stephen and St. Laurence in the cathedral's nave (south\r\nside), and several brilliant lights in St. Bonnat's church. Even the\r\nXVII century produced interesting work at Bourges; in the Martigny\r\nchapel of the cathedral (north side of nave) the portrait of the donor\r\nis as realistic as a miniature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF BEAUVAIS[139]\r\n\r\n     C'est alors que se constitue cette merveilleuse discipline, vrai\r\n     fondement de la culture intellectuelle et de la science, qu'est la\r\n     discipline scholastique.... Toute la connaissance est tournée vers\r\n     la science de l'être, vers la métaphysique, plus haut encore vers\r\n     la théologie; plus haut encore, vers théologie vécue, vers la\r\n     contemplation.--JACQUES MARITAIN.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Beauvais derived directly from Amiens, and no\r\nexpression of the Gothic principle was ever carried farther. It consists\r\nof a mammoth choir and transept. As the height of the edifice is three\r\ntimes its width, the nave which now is lacking would need to have been\r\nof enormous length. Instead of that much-needed nave, there nestles\r\nunder the truncated west end a modest little Carolingian edifice called\r\nthe _Basse-OEuvre_, built by the fortieth bishop of Beauvais, Hervé\r\n(987-998). The small cubic stones and occasional courses of brick tell\r\nof the antiquity of this, the best-preserved monument in France, dating\r\nbefore the year 1000.[140] Most of the Romanesque churches of the Oise\r\ncopied it. Scarcely, however, had the Ile-de-France Picard Romanesque\r\nschool developed than the privileged region gave birth to the national\r\nart.\r\n\r\nIn 1227 Beauvais planned a new cathedral, spurred on thereto by the\r\nmagnificent nave rising in neighboring Amiens. But the works were not\r\nstarted till 1247, for the bishop, more a feudal baron than a pastor,\r\nwas for a time entirely engrossed in mercenary wars in Italy and in\r\nquarreling with Blanche of Castile, the queen-regent. Finally Bishop\r\nMilon began his cathedral in Beauvais on a scale beyond the resources of\r\nthe diocese. Despite his own and the chapter's generous donations, and\r\nthe exemption of workmen and all building material from taxes, the choir\r\nwas not finished till 1272, two years after the choir of Cologne.\r\nScarcely was it done when, in 1284, its upper vaulting fell; a few years\r\nearlier a partial collapse had occurred. To remedy the disaster new\r\npiers had to be inserted between the old ones, which explains the\r\nsharp-pointed arches of the pier arcade. Only in the ambulatory, which\r\nwas untouched by the falling masonry, is the original vaulting to be\r\nfound. The required addition of flying buttresses was no improvement to\r\nthe symmetry of the exterior. Instead of being able to proceed to the\r\nerection of a nave, forty years were wasted in repairs.\r\n\r\nThen came the calamities of the Hundred Years' War when building\r\nactivities flagged all over France. Never again were profiles to be\r\nvirile. The apogee hour of Gothic was forever past. With English,\r\nBurgundian, and French troops roving the country, Beauvais was kept on\r\nthe alert. In 1429, the citizens, roused by Jeanne d'Arc's success at\r\nOrléans, expelled their bishop, who was in sympathy with the foe, and\r\nwas none other than the unworthy Pierre Cauchon, soon to sit as\r\nmiscreant judge at the Maid's trial in Rouen. Two years after Jeanne\r\nhad been burned, Beauvais was besieged by English troops, and so gallant\r\nwas the behavior of the women of the city, notably Jeanne Hachette, that\r\nforever after was accorded to them the right to march in the place of\r\nhonor in all processions, directly behind the clergy. When the Duke of\r\nBurgundy, England's ally, besieged the city in 1472 he burned the\r\nepiscopal palace, to which the two sturdy towers near the\r\n_Basse-OEuvre_ originally belonged. Once more the women of Beauvais\r\nfought side by side with the men, while the children and the aged\r\ngathered in the cathedrals to supplicate Heaven for protection.\r\n\r\nNo city in the land had better cause to rejoice over peace and the\r\ninvader's expulsion than Beauvais. And nowhere did Flamboyant Gothic\r\ntake on nobler expression than in the stately transept now added to the\r\ncathedral, a masterpiece worthy to be joined to the giant choir. On its\r\nnorth front worked Martin Chambiges, who gave to Troyes and Sens their\r\nadmirable façades. Over-ornamentation was a pitfall for the late-Gothic\r\nmasters, but not for Chambiges, who kept Beauvais' strong lines of\r\nconstruction unobliterated by lavish detail.\r\n\r\nFlamboyant Gothic was essentially a decorative art. Therein only did it\r\ndiffer from preceding schools, for it developed no new principles of\r\nconstruction. Because of the flamelike undulations of its window\r\ntracery, the Norman archæologist, M. de Caumont, who had brought into\r\nuse the name Romanesque, invented the equally useful term\r\nFlamboyant.[141] Capricious, overladen, disturbingly restless, this\r\nfinal phase of the national art may often be (it has been called more\r\nterrestrial than celestial), it was inclined to exhibit its technical\r\ndexterity; but none the less it was keenly alive and a vast improvement\r\non the over-formalized geometric Rayonnant Gothic to which it succeeded.\r\nIn both, the profiles were prismatic, fluid, and weak. Discipline which\r\nmade for robustness was forever lost.\r\n\r\nA century before the characteristics of Flamboyant art developed in\r\nFrance, they were in use in England, and there called Curvilinear or\r\nDecorated Gothic. Window mullions undulated, arches were crowned with\r\nreversed curves and sculptured finials, secondary, connecting ribs were\r\nadded to the vaulting, bases were elongated, there were interpenetrating\r\nmolds, hanging keystones, piers without capitals, and such new models\r\nfor foliate sculpture as the deeply indented leaves of parsley and curly\r\ncabbage. When capitals were given up, the ribs died away weakly in the\r\npiers. The Gothic of England had changed to its cold Perpendicular phase\r\nby the time that the architects across the Channel adopted the features\r\ncalled Flamboyant in France.\r\n\r\nM. Camille Enlart has developed the idea that the last phase of the\r\nnational architecture was a product of the English occupation during the\r\nHundred Years' War, that from elements of decoration introduced by\r\nEngland, the French composed a style which differed somewhat only from\r\nthat in vogue across the Channel from 1300 to 1360. In France, flowing\r\ntracery and ogee arches were not used before 1375. France need feel no\r\ndiminution of her claim of leadership in Gothic architecture because she\r\nadopted, for her XV-century traits, certain decorative details developed\r\nfirst by others, since the Gothic of England was originally of French\r\nderivation.\r\n\r\nThe theory of an English origin for French Flamboyancy is contested by\r\nM. Anthyme Saint-Paul, who thought that from the same elements of\r\nXIII-century Gothic one country developed its own Curvilinear style and\r\nthe other its own, Flamboyant Gothic.[142] M. de Lasteyrie agreed with\r\nthe thesis that there is a French origin for French late-Gothic\r\nmanifestations. That Flamboyant art is in part indigenous and partly of\r\nforeign derivation is probably nearest the truth. Certainly sporadic\r\ncases of florid features appeared in French art during the XIII and XIV\r\ncenturies, but it is clear that in various places long held by the\r\nEnglish there appeared the first or the fullest expression of\r\nlate-Gothic art.\r\n\r\nBefore the Flamboyant Gothic transept of Beauvais was finished, the\r\nforeign Renaissance had arrived in France. And it showed here in the\r\nrichly sculptured doors. The sibyls, all ten of whom are represented,\r\nare, as pagans, kept outside the church. With skilled gradation the\r\ncarving grows deeper and bolder toward the top of the doors, farthest\r\naway from the eye. Jean Le Pot carved the southern doors in faultless\r\ntaste. He was a glassmaker as well, and in St. Étienne's church are his\r\nwindows beside those of his father-in-law, Engrand Le Prince, who, with\r\nhis sons Jean and Nicholas, made the north and south rose windows of the\r\ncathedral and its splendid Peter and Paul window. Their tree of Jesse,\r\nin St. Étienne's choir, is considered a masterpiece of color and design.\r\nTo-day a Le Prince window in any French city is a matter of civic pride.\r\n\r\nThe old saying ran: \"The choir of Beauvais, the nave of Amiens, the\r\nportals of Rheims, the towers of Chartres\" make the most beautiful\r\ncathedral in the world. One hundred and fifty feet high curve the upper\r\nvaults of Beauvais choir. Beneath them could be set the belfries of\r\nNotre Dame of Paris. As at Bourges, the lofty aisle possesses its own\r\ntriforium and clearstory, but here the clearstory of the central choir\r\nhas not been dwarfed as a result of the stupendous pier arcades.\r\nBeauvais dared to make its upper windows eighty feet high. Think what\r\nits interior would be had it retained the original stained glass! Its\r\ntowering choir windows would scintillate like those of Sainte-Chapelle,\r\nsince it was the Paris school that supplied XIII-century Beauvais.\r\n\r\nSuch a sweep of fragile glass was possible because the play of thrusts\r\nand counterthrusts had been calculated to a certainty. Technically,\r\nBeauvais is the extreme expression of the Gothic theory. It perfected\r\nthe pier by making it elliptical, widest where fell the greatest strain,\r\nnorth and south. It is said that its error lay in certain false\r\nbearings, that some of the intermediate buttresses were balanced half on\r\nair without direct ground supports. That may have been temerarious,\r\nsince building material of perfect quality is required when chances are\r\ntaken. Certainly Beauvais pushed to its rigid consequences the law of\r\nequilibrium, allowing no excess in the supporting members, but it was\r\nnot a builder's folly.\r\n\r\nM. de Lasteyrie has called its plan a _chef-d'oeuvre_ of lightness.\r\nThough the architect pushed his technique to the extreme limit of the\r\nlaw of thrust and counterthrust, he did not pass beyond the possible,\r\nand had he employed the hard, resistant stone of Burgundy the history of\r\nthe cathedral church he built would not be a tale of disasters. What\r\nbrought about the collapse of Beauvais' vaults was the use of inferior\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nSometimes one feels in the hardihood of this cathedral a trace of\r\neverweening pride, as if its certitude of excelling tended to\r\nvirtuosity. The stupefying ascending lines, strong-willed and carried\r\nout with science, seem as much to vaunt the enterprise of their builder\r\nas pay homage to the Creator. Some of the lesser churches, that humbly\r\nand tentatively reached out toward perfection, make a deeper appeal than\r\ndoes stupendous Beauvais. Was man meant for the superlative on earth?\r\nAnd one remembers that Bishop Milon de Nanteuil was a proud man of the\r\nworld, very unlike that true pastor of souls, Maurice de Sully, who with\r\nunpretentious diligence raised Notre Dame of Paris. Such criticisms\r\nwould be silenced, perhaps, had Beauvais a nave from which could be\r\nviewed its overwhelming choir. Truncated as it now is, it is necessary\r\nto crane the neck in order to see its clearstory windows. So colossal a\r\nthing should be led up to gradually; it cries out insistently for its\r\nmissing nave.\r\n\r\nFatality seemed always to pursue Beauvais. After terminating a noble\r\nFlamboyant transept, the ambitious citizens were lured into the scheme\r\nof a central tower, when a church of such height should have at its\r\ncrossing merely a slender spire. Instead of proceeding to build a nave,\r\nthey raised a lantern that lacked merely a few feet of the enormous\r\nheight of St. Peter's dome in Rome. It was a day of tower building in\r\nFrance, and Beauvais, ever hopeful beyond its resources, thought to\r\noutvie all others. On feast days lights were hung in its spire's open\r\nstonework for the illumination of the entire countryside. For five years\r\nonly the giant beacon stood. On Ascension Day of 1573, just after the\r\ncongregation had left the church to walk in procession, the tower fell\r\nwith an appalling noise, covering the whole town with dust. Only one bay\r\nof the nave has been built, its piers have disappearing moldings,\r\namorphous profiles, and no capitals whatever. Beauvais stands a massive\r\nfragment, and there seems little chance that the truncated church will\r\never be completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF TROYES[143]\r\n\r\n    With travail great, and little cargo fraught,\r\n      See how our world is laboring in pain;\r\n      So filled we are with love of evil gain\r\n    That no one thinks of doing what he ought,\r\n      But we all hustle in the Devil's train,\r\n    And only in his service toil and pray;\r\n    And God, who suffered for us agony,\r\n      We set behind, and treat him with disdain.\r\n    Hardy is he whom death doth not dismay.\r\n    The feeble mouse, against the winter's cold\r\n      Garners the nuts and grain within his cell,\r\n      While man goes groping, without sense to tell\r\n    Where to seek refuge against growing old....\r\n    The Devil doth in snares our life enfold.\r\n      Four hooks he has with torments baited well;\r\n      And first with Greed he casts a mighty spell,\r\n    And then, to fill his nets has Pride enrolled,\r\n    And Luxury steers the boat and fills the sail,\r\n    And Perfidy controls and sets the snare.\r\n    Thus the poor fish are brought to land.\r\n         --COUNT THIBAUT IV of Champagne.[144]\r\n\r\nBeneath the present choir of Troyes Cathedral are Gallo-Roman walls, and\r\na succession of edifices have stood on the same site. From the cathedral\r\nof the V century started the bishop, St. Loup, \"the friend of God,\" when\r\nhe went forth to check Attila the Hun, \"God's scourge,\" and the\r\nbarbarian was touched by spiritual fear and retired. That same good\r\nbishop of Troyes was the companion of St. Germain of Auxerre, on the\r\nnotable journey north, when they blessed the gentle child Geneviève in a\r\nvillage near Paris, marking her as a vessel of election.\r\n\r\nProbably the cathedral immediately preceding the present one was in\r\nlarge part early-Gothic. Fire wiped it out, in 1188, and preparations\r\nfor a new basilica were started by the energetic Bishop Garnier de\r\nTrainel, who went on the Fourth Crusade, and was among those, says\r\nVillehardouin, who scaled the walls of captured Constantinople along\r\nwith his friend Nivelon, the bishop-builder of Soissons.\r\n\r\nThe first stone of the new cathedral at Troyes was laid in 1206 by\r\nBishop Hervé (1206-23), an able man who had been advanced by the\r\nobservant prelate of Paris, Eudes de Sully. For almost twenty years\r\nBishop Hervé worked on the choir, considered one of the best chevets in\r\nFrance. During his episcopate Troyes was a brilliant center of European\r\ntrade and culture. Blanche of Castile and young Louis IX passed some\r\ntime in the city when Thibaut IV the Singer, related to the royal line,\r\nwas attacked by the clique of rebellious barons who plotted against the\r\nboy king. There had been considerable romancing about the volatile,\r\ninconstant Thibaut's admiration for Queen Blanche, who was a married\r\nwoman before he was born. His own mother, Blanche of Navarre, another of\r\nthe able women rulers of that day, gave generously to the new cathedral\r\nof her capital city.\r\n\r\nIn 1228 a storm damaged the rising structure, necessitating years of\r\ntiresome repairs. Pope Urban IV, as a native son of Troyes, contributed.\r\nDuring the last forty years of the XIII century the transept was\r\nbuilding. It showed traces of English feeling derived perhaps from\r\nEdmund Plantagenet, a son of the builder of Westminster Abbey, who had\r\nmarried the dowager Countess of Champagne. His ward Jeanne, Thibaut the\r\nSinger's granddaughter, inherited the countship of Champagne, the\r\nkingdom of Navarre, and by marriage became the queen of France.\r\n\r\nSlowly during the XIV and XV centuries, one bay of the nave was added to\r\nanother; the changes from the precise lines of Rayonnant tracery to the\r\nundulating mullions of the Flamboyant day are easy to follow. The long\r\ndelays were caused by lack of funds and the repeated need for\r\nconsolidating the parts already built. The soil on which the church\r\nstood was unsuitable, and from the first, security was jeopardized by\r\nusing the soft, native stone in those parts of the edifice which were\r\nout of sight, in order to economize on the firm stone imported from\r\nBurgundy.\r\n\r\nSeveral times during the difficulties of reconstruction, the cathedral\r\nchapter turned for advice to noted masters--to Raymond du Temple,\r\nCharles V's architect, and to André de Dammartin, patronized by the\r\nking's brothers of Berry and Burgundy. Work ceased altogether during\r\nthe English occupancy.\r\n\r\nThen in 1429 the city opened its gates to Charles VII on his way to be\r\ncrowned at Rheims. Jeanne d'Arc, during her trial in Rouen, told of an\r\nincident of their entry into Troyes. Some of the townspeople were\r\nfearful lest the heroine of Orleans came of the devil, so they had a\r\nholy preacher march out to exorcise her. Scattering holy water and\r\nmaking repeated signs of the Cross, Brother Richard approached the Maid.\r\n\"Draw near without uneasiness,\" Jeanne assured him, in her pleasant\r\nmanner. \"I won't fly away.\"\r\n\r\nThe city by its reception of the king evinced eagerness to wipe out the\r\ninfamy of the Treaty of Troyes, signed here in 1420 by Queen Isabeau of\r\nBavaria, wherein she repudiated her son Charles VII and gave France over\r\nto the foreign invader. The people's renewed hope and self-respect\r\nexpressed itself in some of the most lovely Flamboyant foliage ever\r\nchiseled--the deeply undercut leafage on the gable of the north portal\r\n(1462-68).\r\n\r\nWork on the cathedral was taken up with energy after Jeanne, carrying\r\nher standard, had hallowed the streets of Troyes. As the XV century\r\nclosed, the nave's radiant late-Gothic windows were installed. They are\r\nof the _Biblia pauperum_ type, and are surprisingly like big translucent\r\nwoodcuts. They tell the story of Daniel, Tobias, Joseph and his\r\nbrethren, Job--a window especially to be noticed--some parables, too,\r\nand edifying legends. The scenes are set quite as they appeared in the\r\nmystery plays, the costumes being not of Syria, but of the very stuffs\r\nand damasks bought in their own international fairs. The same masters of\r\nTroyes, Verrat, Godon, Lyénin, Macadré, who signed a rose window of Sens\r\ntransept, put their signatures here.\r\n\r\nBible stories such as these suit the layman's part of a church, for they\r\nserve to hold the attention of the average man. In the choir of Troyes\r\nare thirteen large windows of an earlier day, profounder in color and\r\nmore spiritual in suggestion. They are like a jeweled cloistral screen\r\naround the Holy of Holies. In the upper central windows are the Passion\r\nscenes, and on either side rise tier on tier of martyrs who witnessed to\r\nthe Faith--bishops, abbots, and a few important personages, such as Pope\r\nInnocent III, Bishop Hervé, the builder, and the archbishop of Sens, the\r\nlearned Pierre de Corbeil. On one side of the choir Henry I, emperor of\r\nConstantinople, of the house of Champagne, is pictured, and\r\nPhilippe-Auguste, suzerain of Champagne. And opposite in the fourth\r\nwindow are donjons and fleurs-de-lys showing that the queen-regent,\r\nBlanche of Castile, was generous here as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe upper choir windows of Troyes allowed more light to pass than had\r\ntheir immediate predecessors, the lancets of Chartres. Their colors were\r\nclear and bright; only such stone mullions were used as were absolutely\r\nrequired for the support of the glass. The eight lateral windows of the\r\nupper choir belong to the XIII century, the five at the eastern curve to\r\nthe XIV century. In the lower choir are various ancient windows,\r\nliberally restored, the Tree of Jesse, of Byzantine character, being the\r\nbest. Two hundred years later another Tree of Jesse was made by\r\nLyénin,[145] for the clearstory of the nave. It gave Christian folk a\r\nfeeling of pride to record the Lord's high ancestry according to Isaias\r\nand the Acts. This cathedral of Troyes was one of the first to glaze its\r\ntriforium, even before St. Denis' abbatial. The present triforium lights\r\nare, in most part, modern.\r\n\r\nBy 1504 the clearstory windows of the nave were all in place. Among\r\ntheir donors was represented a mayor of Troyes with all his family. The\r\ngolden-hued west rose was put up in 1546. And even into the XVII century\r\nthe vitrine art of this exceptional city maintained its high traditions\r\nof five hundred years. In 1625 Linard Gontier made the _Pressoir_\r\nwindow, the swan-song of good Renaissance glass. There is a translucent\r\npicture of Our Lady in the nave's south aisle, with stars leaded into\r\nholes that were cut out of an entire plate of glass; any apprentice who\r\ncould perform that difficult feat of glazing was promoted to be a master\r\ncraftsman.[146]\r\n\r\nFor the building of the cathedral's west front, the chapter, in 1506,\r\ncalled on the noted late-Gothic master, Martin Chambiges, who had made\r\nhis reputation with transept façades at Beauvais and Sens. Together with\r\nother artists, his son, Pierre (who won fame with Senlis' transept\r\nfaçade, and who, in 1539, began the château of St. Germain-en-Laye),\r\ncarried on Troyes' frontispiece during fifty years, so that its\r\nimagery--badly damaged by the Revolution--shows the ermine of Anne of\r\nBrittany, the porcupine of Louis XII, and the salamander of Francis I.\r\nTroyes, with its record of four hundred years, was, of all the\r\ncathedrals of France, the longest in building.\r\n\r\nIn spite of its double aisles, its wide transept, its noble, deep choir,\r\nand its astounding wealth of storied windows, it is clear when standing\r\nbefore the Flamboyant Gothic front of this chief church of Champagne's\r\ncapital, that it is a cathedral of secondary rank. The flaw here is one\r\nof proportion. With such width--and this is the widest cathedral in\r\nFrance--the church should be thirty feet higher. However, no traveler\r\nwith harmony in his soul thinks of technical criticism once he steps\r\nacross the threshold and walks beneath the joyous terrestrial windows of\r\nthe nave and the seraphic lights of the sanctuary.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. URBAIN AND OTHER CHURCHES AT TROYES[147]\r\n\r\n    Madame, je vous le demande,\r\n    Pensez-vous ne soit péché\r\n    D'occire son vrai amant?\r\n    Oïl voir; bien le sachiez.\r\n    S'il vous plaît ne m'occiez;\r\n    Car, je vous le dis vraiment,\r\n    Quoique l'amour soit tourment,\r\n    Si vous m'aimez mieux vivant.\r\n    Je n'en serai point fâché.\r\n    --THIBAUT IV of Champagne, in lighter mood.\r\n\r\nSt. Urbain's famous collegiate church, a forerunner of XIV-century\r\nRayonnant Gothic, was founded by a son of Troyes, who sat in Peter's\r\nchair, Urban IV. He tells us that \"in the desire that the memory of this\r\nour name might remain forever in the city of Troyes even after the\r\ndissolution of our body,\" he began, in 1262, a church on the site where\r\nhis father's shop had stood, choosing for its tutelary the saint-pope,\r\nUrban, who had succored the early martyrs in Rome. His father was a\r\nprosperous shoemaker in the day when tradesmen gave princely gifts to\r\ntheir parish churches. Urban IV himself had been a choir boy in Troyes\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\nHe died before his church was finished, but his nephew, Cardinal\r\nPantaleone Ancher, continued the edifice, which was completed in 1276.\r\nUrban's successor, Clement IV, also a Frenchman, patronized the new\r\nworks at Troyes. While the choir and transept were done by one\r\ngeneration, many a century was to pass before the westernmost bay and\r\nfaçade were finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _St. Urbain at Troyes (1264-1276)_]\r\n\r\nIn archæological circles St. Urbain is noted, Viollet-le-Duc being the\r\nfirst to discuss its ingenuity. As construction it is a small\r\nmasterpiece, a model of elasticity, perhaps the lightest and most\r\nfragile of all Gothic edifices. To an economy in stone we owe this\r\nstructural feat. Were the principle of equilibrium pushed a step\r\nfarther, metal, not stone, would be required. Ground supports have been\r\nlessened, and flying buttresses attenuated to the last limit. Despite\r\nits science, St. Urbain is not doctrinaire, but immaterial and\r\nseductive. On first entering it Montalembert exclaimed, \"_Quelle\r\ndélicieuse église!_\"\r\n\r\nThe architect, Jean Langlois, here created the most elegant form of\r\nRayonnant window tracery. At his porch appears the first French arch of\r\ndouble curvature, the earliest interpenetration of archivolts. We know\r\nhis name because in 1267 a papal bull summoned him to account for sums\r\nadvanced on the edifice, and Jean was not forthcoming, because he had\r\ndisappeared in the East, crusading. The chief church at Famagusta, in\r\nCyprus, begun in 1300--the only completed French-Gothic cathedral of the\r\nXIV century--shows such analogies with St. Urbain at Troyes that\r\napparently Langlois' architectural influence had spread in the Orient.\r\n\r\nM. Lefèvre-Pontalis has called Troyes' lantern church inundated with\r\nlight one of the most original monuments of the Middle Ages. Ten feet\r\nabove the ground its walls change to opalescent glass. No grisaille is\r\nmore exquisitely decorated with natural foliage outlines; set in the\r\nexpanses of the opal-tinted white glass are colored medallions of\r\nextreme beauty. The lower row of lights around the choir are of this\r\ncharacter. Above them, and almost a part of them, are the choir's upper\r\nwindows--big prophets and patriarchs with the Crucifixion in the\r\ncenter--transition windows between legend-medallion glass, and the XIV\r\ncentury's single figures in a vitrine architectural frame. The arms of\r\nFrance, Champagne, and Navarre appear in the borders of the choir\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe transeptal chapel to the north of the choir shows in its quatrefoils\r\nsome interesting heads of men, women, and children. From the windows of\r\nthe south transeptal chapel some panels were stolen, but St. Urbain's\r\ncuré, Abbé Jossier, a learned enthusiast, was able, by sending\r\nphotographs all over France, to trace his lost panels in a private\r\ncollection, and it is to be hoped they may be returned.\r\n\r\nIn his short pontificate, 1262-64, Urban IV, besides creating this\r\nenduring memorial, instituted the feast of Corpus Christi. He requested\r\na liturgy for his new feast from St. Thomas Aquinas, who composed the\r\n_Pange lingua gloriosi_, the last stanzas of which are sung daily\r\nthroughout the Christian world, the familiar _Tantum ergo_. To Aquinas\r\nis ascribed the _Verbum supernum prodiens_ hymn whose ending is the\r\nlovely _O Salutaris Hostia_. Doubt and heresy have always been\r\ninstrumental in clarifying doctrine and in enriching the liturgy and\r\nart. So in a later day was made, in reaction against the XVI-century\r\ndesecration of the Eucharist, such windows as the Wine Press of Troyes\r\nand that of Conches.\r\n\r\nIn 1906, soon after St. Urbain's church had celebrated the completion of\r\nits western portal, it became the scene of a conscientious objection on\r\nthe part of its parishioners, who protested against the taking of an\r\ninventory, they deeming it an unlawful interference with their private\r\naffairs. They sat in their church till the police broke in the doors;\r\neven then they continued to sing canticles, and were expelled only by\r\nhaving a hose turned on them. Six centuries earlier, St. Urbain's had\r\nbeen the scene, on the completion of its choir, of a suffragette-like\r\ndemonstration by a community of nuns, who claimed part of the land on\r\nwhich the church stood. They smashed various things on the premises,\r\nand, it is whispered, even slapped a high dignitary's face. Apparently\r\nSt. Urbain's is destined to pass into history under various aspects.\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years the ancient capital of Champagne was an active\r\ncenter of the stained-glass industry. Overpowering is the wealth of\r\nstoried windows to be found in its churches, the majority being of the\r\nFlamboyant-Renaissance day. In the suburbs, and farther afield in the\r\nhamlets of Champagne, there is the same prodigal display of colored\r\nwindows and interesting statues.[148] From father to son, from\r\ngeneration to generation, was passed on the art skill of this ancient\r\ncity on the highway of international trade.\r\n\r\nIn Troyes there were so many churches that the old saying ran: \"You\r\narrived from Troyes? And what are they doing there?\" \"_On y sonne._\"\r\nNext to St. Urbain's, for its wealth of art treasures, comes the\r\nMadeleine church built about 1175, and reconstructed during the\r\nFlamboyant enthusiasm when this city readorned almost every shrine it\r\npossessed. Contemporary with its noted _jubé_, or rood screen (1508-17),\r\nis the statue of St. Martha, one of the gems of French sculpture,\r\nentirely of the national school, unaffected work as ample and robust as\r\nthe best period of the XIII century. St. Martha is represented, in this\r\nchurch of Troyes dedicated to her sister, with the holy water by which\r\nshe exorcised the legendary Tarasque of Tarascon. She was the patroness\r\nof housekeepers, and it is said that the servant maids of Troyes\r\npresented to their church this memorial of the plastic genius of\r\nChampagne.[149]\r\n\r\nChampagne's special aptitude for sculpture appeared in the XIII-century\r\ngargoyles of St. Urbain's church, each of which was almost a complete\r\nfigure. Later her imagery grew mannered for a few generations, with the\r\nMadonna's face of a formal type, and an exaggerated throwing out of the\r\nhip. The advent of Flemish realism, through the Franco-Flamand school at\r\nDijon, renewed the vigor of French idealism, and before the XV century\r\nclosed a truly French Renaissance had set in, retaining the equipoise of\r\nthe old school and quite free of Italian classicism.\r\n\r\nEventually the imported standards checked that renewed national\r\nmovement. It was not the big men of Italy's revival who came to\r\nChampagne, but secondary artists whose work was often pretentious or\r\ncoldly abstract. From 1540, under the leadership of the Italian,\r\nDomenico Rinnuccini, called Florentino, the foreign Renaissance\r\nprevailed at Troyes. In the church of the Madeleine, besides its _jubé_\r\nand St. Martha statue, is some of the best XVI-century glass. A window\r\nof 1506 tells the life of St. Eloi, the goldsmith-bishop of Noyon; a\r\nwindow dated 1517 is devoted to St. Louis; Jean Macadré I made a Jesse\r\ntree; and there is the celebrated Creation in which God the Father wears\r\nthe papal tiara, significant of the reaction that followed Luther's\r\nattacks on Rome. There are, also, two good XV-century windows, the\r\nLord's Passion and the Magdalene's story.\r\n\r\nSo vast is the accumulation of treasures in the sanctuaries of Troyes\r\nthat one can indicate merely a few of them. In St. Jean's\r\nchurch--Flamboyant Gothic mainly, with a XII-century tower and a\r\nXIV-century nave--is a Visitation (1520) by Nicolas Haslin, a meeting of\r\ntwo pleasant dames of Troyes, wearing robes of Burgundian fullness, a\r\ngroup in which there appears a first evidence of transalpine influence.\r\nThe reredos, from the Juliot studio, that led in the transition from\r\nFrench Gothic art to the neo-classic standards, has conventional images\r\nsomewhat overgestured. In the flat eastern wall of St. Jean is a\r\n_maîtresse vitre_ (1630) by the Gontier brothers, delicate in hue, yet\r\nradiant, with half tones such as mauve, salmon pink, soft grays,\r\npomegranate, celadine green. Eagerly the Renaissance masters seized on\r\nthe new invention of _verre double_, which allowed them a fuller\r\npalate. Their over-use of opaque enamel-painting on glass led to the\r\ndeterioration of the vitrine art, for the picture-painter soon swamped\r\nthe glazier and draftsman who had worked in subordination to the\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\nIn the church of St. Pantaléon, where Lyénin II worked, the windows are\r\nin one or two tones, gray-brown with silver-stain yellow and flesh\r\ncolor, a style better suited to domestic interiors or to civic halls\r\nthan to churches. The church boasts a statue of St. James and a Charité\r\nby Domenico Florentino, and a St. Crespin group by a son of Troyes,\r\nFrançois Gentil, influenced by the Italian. To Gentil is attributed the\r\nChrist at the column and the Christ bearing the Cross in the church of\r\nSt. Nicolas, where are also images of St. Anne and St. Joachim from the\r\nJuliot studio, a St. Bonaventure from the same source whence emanated\r\nthe adorable statue of St. Martha, and more of the grisaille\r\npicture-glass. In St. Martin-ès-Vignes the window of St. Anne (1623) is\r\nattributed to Linard Gontier; in Ste. Sabine are some painted wood\r\npanels, and a carved keystone of great beauty; in the hall of the\r\nlibrary of Troyes are thirty panels by Linard Gontier, made in\r\ncommemoration of Henry IV's visit in 1598.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHÂLONS CATHEDRAL[150]\r\n\r\nIt so happens that in most of our communes the church remains the only\r\nwitness of the olden times and of departed generations. It thus becomes\r\na symbol, legible for the humblest, of the duration of our race, of the\r\npersistence, through the dead, of a special group of French families on\r\na special corner of French soil. The village church gives the lesson of\r\nlineage, of the solidarity of efforts, of the communion of men.--EDMOND\r\nBLANQUERON, Inspecteur de l'Académie de la Haute-Marne, in the crusade\r\nto save the churches of Champagne, notably Vignory, one of the oldest in\r\nFrance (c. 1050).\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Troyes and the church of St. Urbain belong to the\r\nChampagne school of Gothic, to which we have devoted no separate chapter\r\nbecause some of its monuments, such as St. Remi at Rheims and Notre Dame\r\nat Châlons, we grouped with the Primary Gothic churches, and the\r\ncathedral of Rheims with the Great Cathedrals, classifications used\r\nsolely for greater clarity.\r\n\r\nFrom its inception, the Gothic of Champagne kept pace with the\r\nIle-de-France Picard school, and in certain characteristics even took\r\nthe lead of its neighbor. Gerson, Racine, La Fontaine, Gaston Paris, are\r\namong the sons of this province whose Gothic art, formulated centuries\r\nbefore them, displays qualities which embody aspiration, sublimity,\r\nsanity always and just measure, a singular ease and grace, patience, and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nFrom Champagne came the gracious arrangement of planting slender columns\r\nand stilted arches at the entrance to radiating chapels. Champagne was\r\nthe first to use the pier composed of twin columns, first to employ a\r\npassageway round the church at the level of the aisle windows, and to\r\nplace lancets side by side in each bay for the better lighting of the\r\nedifice. The region was conservative in clinging to certain Romanesque\r\ntraits, such as apsidal chapels projecting from the eastern wall of the\r\ntransept. It employed, as did Normandy and Burgundy, a circulation\r\npassage under the clearstory windows. Champagne's influence spread far\r\nafield to Sens, Auxerre, St. Quentin, St. Denis, Metz, Toul, Ipres,\r\nTournai, Avila, León, and York.[151]\r\n\r\nLest these pages should become overloaded, we can merely touch on the\r\nbeautiful Champagne cathedral of Châlons-sur-Marne, an old city which\r\nis another treasure house of colored glass. The most interesting windows\r\nare in the small church of St. Alpin, whose apse celebrates the\r\nEucharist, the souls in Purgatory, the Corpus Christi procession, lately\r\nmocked by the Calvinists. Its Manna in the Desert window is a symbol of\r\nthe Eucharist. In St. Alpin are the most successful examples of that\r\ndistinguished phase of vitrine art called _camaïeu_--of cameo or\r\nchiaroscuro effect, using brown-gray hues, the yellow of silver-stain, a\r\npale blue for the sky, and an occasional single touch of superb ruby\r\nred. One of the windows of Raphaelesque design represents St. Alpin,\r\nbishop of Châlons, meeting Attila the Hun; another, dated 1539, is a\r\nrendering of the Vision of Augustus, a theme most popular then.\r\n\r\nPeter the Venerable called Châlons \"great and illustrious.\" Guillaume de\r\nChampeaux, one of the most learned men of the age, whose schoolroom was\r\nreally the beginning of the University of Paris, was bishop of Châlons\r\nin 1115 when a young Burgundian named Bernard came to be consecrated\r\nabbot of Clairvaux. In the monk of twenty-five, unknown yet to fame, the\r\ngreat teacher was swift to recognize a supreme spiritual genius. In 1147\r\nSt. Bernard preached at the dedication of the Romanesque cathedral of\r\nChâlons before Pope Eugene III, who had been one of his own Cistercian\r\nmonks at Clairvaux. The present tower to the north of the choir belonged\r\nto the church that Bernard knew. The south tower, its mate, is of the\r\nXIII century. The placing of belfries on either side of the choir was a\r\nRhenish trait.\r\n\r\nIn 1230 Châlons Cathedral was wrecked by lightning. Its reconstruction\r\nbegan with the choir, under Bishop Pierre de Nemours, whose brothers\r\nwere building-prelates at Noyon, Paris, and Meaux. In 1250 work on the\r\nnave was going on, and at the end of the century was built the\r\ntransept's excellent north façade. The XVII century erected the\r\nunsuitable neo-classic west frontispiece, yet at the same time,\r\ncuriously enough, the two westernmost bays were constructed in perfect\r\nimitation of Apogec Gothic. It remains an open question whether the\r\nsame Renaissance century made the apse chapels after a fire in 1668.\r\nSome say they are of the XIV century, that the choir, as first built,\r\nhad no ambulatory, but that one was added soon after, with radial\r\nchapels.\r\n\r\nThere is a noble purity in Châlons Cathedral, due in large part to its\r\nsoaring monolithic piers. No church is richer in tombstones, and its\r\nstained glass is plenteous. In the eastern clearstory are three lovely\r\nsilver and blue XIII-century windows; the north rose of the transept is\r\nearly XIV century and the first window in the nave's south aisle is\r\nanother good example of that period. The same aisle shows a brilliant\r\nXV-century light, ruby red in effect, and a window of 1509, wherein the\r\nBlessed Virgin's life is explained by quaint inscriptions. Some\r\nXII-century glass from Châlons Cathedral is in the Trocadéro Museum at\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nJust as Champagne had proved herself a pioneer in the first days of the\r\nnational art, so she distinguished herself in later times when Rayonnant\r\nGothic turned to Flamboyant art. Among the few churches built during the\r\ntransition between those two phases is the cathedral-like\r\nNotre-Dame-de-l'Épine, in the fields a few miles from Châlons-sur-Marne,\r\na link connecting St. Urbain at Troyes with the goodly array of\r\nFlamboyant buildings that sprang up in the ancient capital of Champagne.\r\nThe interior proportions of Notre-Dame-de-l'Épine resemble those of\r\nRheims Cathedral, and its rood screen recalls the _jubé_ of the\r\nMadeleine church at Troyes.\r\n\r\nBut _revenons à nostro matière_, as dear Joinville, seneschal of\r\nChampagne, would say. The reason for the wealth of architecture and its\r\nallied arts and crafts in the region of which Troyes is the center was\r\nbecause the ancient city, so unnoted in to-day's activities, lay on the\r\nmediæval highway of commerce, and under its enterprising rulers became\r\nthe scene bi-yearly of a fair to which all Europe flocked. To this day\r\nwe use Troy weight. The counts of Champagne safeguarded the visiting\r\nmerchants and fostered commerce by wise laws. Their money passed in Rome\r\nand Venice as freely as in Provins and Troyes. Lavish and art-loving\r\nwere the Champagne rulers; one of them founded Clairvaux in lower\r\nChampagne; another rebuilt the Cistercian church of Pontigny, just over\r\nthe border in Burgundy. They were indefatigable crusaders, some of them\r\nwinning thrones in the East. And their alliances constantly enriched\r\ntheir stock with new qualities, as when Count Henry the Magnificent\r\nwedded, in 1164, the daughter of Louis VII by Aliénor of Aquitaine. That\r\nCountess Marie--the _suer comtessa_ to whom her half brother, Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion, addressed his famous prison song--made of her court of\r\nChampagne a school of good manners with all the ceremonial of the Midi's\r\n_cour d'amour_. What M. Gaston Paris calls poet-laureates' work, _poésie\r\ncourtoise_, became the vogue, and the Countess Marie herself wrote in\r\nthe troubadour manner. She encouraged the best of the XII-century poets,\r\nCrestien de Troyes (d. 1175), suggesting to him the romances of the\r\nBreton cycle, Lancelot, Tristan, and Percival.[152] Through Crestien the\r\nstory of the Holy Grail spread over Europe. In him the trouvères new\r\nideals of chivalry met the Midi's refined gallantry, and the Celtic\r\nthemes which he versified brought what was needed of passion and\r\nprofundity.\r\n\r\nAll Europe then drew its poetic inspirations from the _matière de\r\nFrance_, as France in her turn was enriching herself from the\r\ninexhaustible _matière de Bretagne_. The XII-century French trouvères\r\nwere imitated by the German Minnesingers, by the early songsters of\r\nEngland, Spain, and Portugal, and in Italy the precursors of Dante\r\npreferred the use of the Romance tongues of France. In the fecund hour\r\nwherein our modern civilization was conceived, France gave to the\r\nWestern World her architecture, her sculpture, and her poetry. At the\r\ncathedral doors of Verona, Roland and Oliver were sculpted.\r\n\r\nThe international city of Troyes saw the creation of the Templars Order\r\nat her Council of 1128, whither had come Hugues de Payns, a knight\r\nrelated to the reigning counts. Taking part in the First Crusade, he\r\nproved himself a true _prud'homme_ in Palestine by forming a band of\r\nvolunteer knights to escort unprotected pilgrims. At the Council of\r\nTroyes he won recognition for his monk-knights. St. Bernard championed\r\nthem, drew up their rule, and gave them their white robe and red cross.\r\nWith the birth of the national art rose this great military Order and\r\nwith its decline it was stricken down. When the lust of gain replaced\r\naspiration, men no longer went crusading or built cathedrals.\r\n\r\nThe ancient city of Troyes is not only associated with epic\r\npoetry--\"history before there are historians\"--but is linked with the\r\nearliest two historians who wrote in the vernacular, Villehardouin and\r\nJoinville. \"_Mes lengages est buens car en France fui nez_,\" boasted the\r\nChampagne poet, who tells us that God listened by preference to his\r\nspeech, since he had made it lighter and better than any other, of more\r\nbrevity, of nobler amplitude. Villehardouin's record of the Fourth\r\nCrusade, the _Conquête de Constantinople_, possesses the same powerful\r\nsimplicity as the greatest of all chansons-de-geste, _Roland_. He was\r\nborn near Troyes, in whose convents lived two of his daughters and his\r\ntwo sisters, and to whose churches he left property.\r\n\r\nOur good friend Joinville grew up in the cultivated court of the\r\nCountess Marie's grandson, Thibaut IV _le Chansonnier_, born in Troyes.\r\nThibaut's songs blended the courteous poetry of the troubadour tradition\r\nwith the attic salt of his own most civilized Champagne. In his gallant\r\ncompany Joinville acquired his good manners and inimitable mode of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe last countess of this land of gay singers and soldier-historians\r\nwas Thibaut's granddaughter, Jeanne, who inspired Joinville to write his\r\nmemoirs, helped to build Meaux Cathedral, and founded the College of\r\nNavarre where Gerson and Bossuet were to be trained. But, alas! the\r\nliberal young heiress of Champagne married the legist king of France,\r\nPhillipe le Bel, the executioner of the Templars. When he struck a blow\r\nat the international fairs of Champagne by persecuting Lombards and\r\nJews, the great day for Troyes was over. When Jeanne d'Arc--born on the\r\nconfines of Champagne--revived the nation's pride, the art traditions\r\nlatent in the citizens of Troyes flowered once more with magnificence.\r\nOnly the slow accumulation of centuries could have produced the\r\nunemphatic beauty of the gracious St. Martha in Troyes' Flamboyant\r\nGothic church of the Madeleine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF TOURS.[153]\r\n\r\n     A religion is the heart of a race; it expresses the emotions of a\r\n     people and elevates them by giving them an aim: but, unless a God\r\n     be visibly honored, religion does not exist, and human laws are\r\n     powerless.... Thought, the fountain of all good and evil, cannot be\r\n     trained, mastered, and directed except by religion, and the only\r\n     possible religion is Christianity, which created the modern world\r\n     and will preserve it.... France is being saved and lost\r\n     perpetually. If she wants to be saved, indeed, let her go back to\r\n     the laws of God.--HONORÉ DE BALZAC (1799-1850; born in Tours).\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Tours does not startle. One is not carried away by it,\r\nat first. Its charm is that of the tranquil horizons of the Loire,\r\n_fleuve de lumière, de vie doucement heureuse, partout de plein effets\r\nde lenteur, d'ordre_, so Rodin saw it. The beauty of Touraine increases\r\nwith familiarity because it is touched with that measure, that justness\r\nof soul inherited from the classic spirit, that has ever tempered, in\r\nthe art manifestations of this nation, the sublime overimpassioned\r\nconsistencies of the Celt and the lofty overexaggerated dreams of the\r\nTeuton.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Tours does not aspire to the impossible. It is a rather\r\ncold, high-bred church at one with its environment, the gracious garden\r\nof Touraine, a satisfying, discreet church and most intensely French.\r\nWhile one rejoices that a Robert de Lusarches aspired to the Infinite at\r\nAmiens, one approves the architect of Tours who worked within human\r\npossibilities. The choir of the cathedral possesses both delicacy and\r\nforce. Toward its erection Louis IX granted a quarry and some forest\r\nlands near Chinon. The choir must have been nearing its completion when\r\nin 1255 the king visited Tours, whose archbishop, Geoffrey de Martel,\r\nhad lately died a crusader in Palestine.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifty years prior to 1270 the cathedral was building. In 1269\r\nthe relics of St. Maurice and his companions from Thebes, who were\r\nmartyred in Gaul under Diocletian, were transferred to the sanctuary.\r\nThose early Christians were the tutelary saints of Tours Cathedral up to\r\nthe XIV century. Then St. Gatien, the first to preach Christianity in\r\nthis region, was chosen as patron. _La Gatienne_ the people call their\r\nchief church. The cult of the early missionary had been a favorite\r\ndevotion of St. Martin, third and greatest bishop of Tours, who died as\r\nthe IV century drew to a close.\r\n\r\nLike Lyons, Tours has eminent ecclesiastical memories. The shrine of St.\r\nMartin, the most popular saint of Gaul, made the city a frequented\r\npilgrimage for Europe. Gregory of Tours, who ruled this see from 573 to\r\n595, has described the richness of the Byzantine church that stood over\r\nthe tomb of the great thaumaturge. Like most of the prelates who saved\r\nLatin civilization from the Barbarian's submersion, Bishop Gregory was\r\nof Gallo-Roman stock, of a senatorial family of Auvergne who boasted\r\ndescent from an early Christian martyr of Gaul. In the present southwest\r\ntower of la Gatienne are traces of the VI-century cathedral built by\r\nthis bishop-historian of Gaul, whose pages are a chief source for\r\nMerovingian times.[154]\r\n\r\nThe city of Tours always had two great monuments--the cathedral within\r\nthe ramparts, the basilica of St. Martin outside the walls. St. Martin's\r\nabbey was the nation's intellectual leader when the Saxon scholar Alcuin\r\nbecame its abbot (796-804). He made of Tours a Christian Athens. They\r\nburied him in his abbatial, where four years earlier Charlemagne's wife,\r\nLuitgarde, had been laid. To-day only two towers stand of St. Martin's\r\nbasilica--the Tour Charlemagne, begun by the Blessed Hervé, abbot in\r\n997, hence one of the oldest memorials of the rebirth of architecture\r\nassociated with the year 1000, and a former façade tower mainly of the\r\nXII century. One of the busiest streets of Tours runs up what once was\r\nthe nave of the abbatial, but, not discouraged, the people of Touraine\r\nhave erected a new Byzantinesque basilica of St. Martin on the site of\r\nthe transept's southern arm. Those two tragic frenzies of forgetfulness,\r\n1562, that scattered St. Martin's ashes--for which St. Eloi,\r\nbishop-goldsmith of Noyon, had made a priceless reliquary--and 1793,\r\nthat laid in ruins his church in Tours and Marmoutier's Apogee Gothic\r\nabbatial that marked the rock-hewn cells where he had lived a hermit\r\nacross the Loire, those two blind hours when men thought to erect\r\nbarriers between themselves and their past, destroyed monuments which,\r\ndid they exist still, would rank Tours, architecturally, among the first\r\ncities of Europe. St. Martin's church, built by Hervé, became a\r\n_monument-type_,[155] copied by Ste. Foi, Congnes, St. Martial,\r\nLimoges, St. Sernin, Toulouse, and the cathedral at Santiago.\r\n\r\nIt is said that twenty centuries of human effort are represented by the\r\nstones of Tours Cathedral.[156] In the base of its façade towers are\r\nremains of the city's III-century walls, which had been constructed in\r\ntheir turn with the big stones stolen from the local Roman temples of 50\r\nB.C. For sixteen centuries Mass has been said on this site. In the\r\nsouthwest tower are vestiges of Gregory of Tours' VI-century church, and\r\nin the northwest tower traces of the Romanesque cathedral on which\r\nworked the philosopher and theologian, Hildebert de Lavardin, the most\r\npopular poet of his age and one of the builders of Le Mans Cathedral\r\nbefore promoted to be Tours' sixty-fourth archbishop (1125-34). In\r\nrefuting Berengar, a canon of Tours, who taught a confused doctrine\r\nconcerning the Eucharist, Bishop Hildebert was the first to use the term\r\n\"transubstantiation\" in its theological sense. It is said that the\r\ncustom of elevating the Host in the Mass resulted from the eucharistic\r\ncontroversies started by Berengar.\r\n\r\nIn 1167 a fire, caused by a quarrel over crusaders' treasure, between\r\nLouis VII and Henry II Plantagenet, destroyed the Romanesque cathedral\r\nof Tours. Bishop Joscion, who died in 1173, planned to construct a\r\nPlantagenet Gothic church, since Touraine was in large part under\r\nAngevin control, and to the church he began belongs the graceful\r\n_bombé_ vault borne on eight slender branches beneath the northwest\r\ntower. In 1191 Richard Coeur-de-Lion came to his city of Tours to\r\nreceive the crusaders' insignia before his venture to the East. His\r\nransom drained the land of building funds. For that cause or another,\r\nthe projected work at Tours languished. The actual choir was begun only\r\nabout 1210, when the city had become a part of the royal domain, and its\r\nnew master Philippe-Auguste wrote that he held the church of Tours to be\r\none of the chief jewels of his crown, and that whosoever molested it\r\ntouched his (the king's) person.\r\n\r\nWe do not know who was the original architect of _la Gatienne_. Étienne\r\nde Mortagne, who designed the Benedictine church at Marmoutier, is\r\nmentioned, in 1269, as master-of-works at the cathedral, but by that\r\ntime its choir was completed. That choir, while making no pretense of\r\nbeing sublime, is a monument of noble robustness, displaying within and\r\nwithout the veriest genius of good taste. The vista closing the eastern\r\nend of the church is one of the most satisfactory in France, owing to\r\nits right proportion. In this, Tours derives directly from Amiens. Its\r\npier arcade comprises one-third of the interior wall elevation; and the\r\ntriforium and clearstory make up the other two-thirds--clearstory being\r\ndouble the height of triforium. At Tours the relation of span and height\r\nis admirable, and both are well correlated with length. Seen in\r\nperspective down the nave, the three stories of colored glass around the\r\nsanctuary are the supreme impression of this church interior, and seldom\r\ndoes one pass from its west portal without turning back for a lingering\r\nlook at that harmonious chevet of consecrated light. Through the pier\r\narches can be seen symmetrically the windows of the apse chapels. The\r\ndesign of the glazed triforium is excelled by no other in France; though\r\nserving as a kind of pedestal for the upper lights, it retains its own\r\nentity.\r\n\r\nWhen the choir of Tours was completed, the builders proceeded at once to\r\nerect the transept which, the stones themselves say, must have been\r\nfinished as the XIII century closed. The nave's easternmost bays\r\ntouching it belong to the first years of the next century, as do the two\r\nrose windows of the transept. The northern rose is irreproachable in\r\ndesign and of the same scintillating jewel tradition as XIII-century\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Years' War, here as elsewhere, checked building activities.\r\nWhen they were resumed at Tours, happily the first plans were adhered\r\nto, so that choir and nave are homogeneous. As the church advanced\r\ntoward the west, the window tracery changed from Rayonnant to\r\nFlamboyant, the profiles grew prismatic, and the sculpture of the\r\ncapitals became naturalistic rather than an architectural interpretation\r\nof foliage. The nave was made narrower than the choir, probably with the\r\nintention of joining it to the XII-century façade. Of the four triumphal\r\npiers at the transept-crossing, the two westernmost ones stand closer\r\ntogether than those flanking the choir, whose spacious procession path\r\ncauses the side aisles of the nave to appear meager.\r\n\r\nWhat might seem an overreasonableness in the architecture of Tours\r\nmetropolitan church is offset by the glory of its jeweled windows.\r\nBetween 1260 and 1270 the choir's upper lights were placed, and\r\nconsidering their date, they are exceptional in still being of the\r\nlegend-medallions type rather than large single figures. Blue is set in\r\ngreenish white with good effect, contrasting happily with certain\r\ncontemporary windows at Paris, where the juxtaposition of blue and red\r\nproduced melancholy purple. The joyous sparkling tone of Tours' lights\r\nproves a skillful use of pot-metal yellow. More care was taken to tell\r\nthe legends plainly than to put borders round each medallion.\r\n\r\nThe glass of Tours belongs to the Paris school, though made, doubtless,\r\nby local workers. Were a floor laid below the triforium of the choir,\r\nits fifteen upper windows, composing a veritable pavilion of glass,\r\nwould be almost a replica of the Sainte-Chapelle, and one recalls that\r\nit was Archbishop Odo of Tours who on April 25, 1248, dedicated for St.\r\nLouis his new shrine at Paris. The donors of Tours' great windows were\r\nchurchmen and laymen, the lowly and the mighty. Bishop Geoffrey de\r\nLoudon, builder of Le Mans' glorious choir, presented a light, as did\r\nTours' own prelate and a group of parish priests. Small craftsmen were\r\ndonors, drapers, and day laborers, and of course Queen Blanche's donjons\r\nof Castile are to be seen. Her window, devoted to St. James, the patron\r\nof Spain, is splendid in hue.\r\n\r\nThe fourth clearstory window on the north excels in color harmony. They\r\ncall it the Adam window, after the first tiller of the soil. It was\r\npresented by plowmen, and relates their field labors as well as the\r\nstory of Genesis. On one side of the central light of the clearstory is\r\na dazzling Tree of Jesse, the gift of a furrier and his wife. Next to it\r\nis a window devoted to St. Martin, whose story is told again, in the\r\nlate XIII-century glass of an apse chapel. More French churches have\r\nbeen dedicated to St. Martin than to any other patron save Notre Dame.\r\nThe windows of the sanctuary north of the axis chapel, though mixed in\r\ndesign, excel all others in exquisite color, being composed of fragments\r\nfrom St. Martin's abbatial reset here. The New Alliance window in the\r\nLady chapel has medallions of Christ bearing His Cross and the\r\nCrucifixion accompanied by such symbols and prefigurings as Elisha\r\nresuscitating the child, Jonah issuing from the whale's jaws, the brazen\r\nserpent, and Moses striking the rock.\r\n\r\nAll the world was a symbol to the men of those Ages of Faith. The\r\ninterlinked petals of the transept's northern rose meet in a symbol of\r\nthe Divinity--a knot without beginning or end--the _forma universal_\r\nvisioned by Dante. There are Frenchmen who think that the splendid rose\r\nwindows in their Gothic cathedrals suggested to the exile of Florence\r\nhis conception of the empyrean. Heaven as Dante visioned it had neither\r\nroof of gold nor pillars of jasper, but was an expanded, supernal, white\r\nrose.\r\n\r\nOnce the nave of Tours Cathedral was filled with late-Gothic windows,\r\nbut storms wrecked many of them. Some of its glass has been set in a\r\nline of lights beneath the transept's north rose, XV-century panels\r\nrepresenting members of the Bourbon Vendôme family, that was to mount\r\nthe French throne with Henry IV. Jean Fouquet might have drawn them.\r\nUnder the XVI-century rose in the west façade is another row of windows\r\ncontaining good portraits of art patrons as munificent as the\r\nBourbons--the Laval-Montmorency family. All over France we find them as\r\ndonors of beautiful things.\r\n\r\nThe hour when Tours was an individual leader in art came during the\r\nlate-Gothic development.[157] Then was finished the cathedral's nave,\r\nchapter house, library, cloister, and the psaltery with its pretty\r\nRenaissance stair. The cathedral canons, _Messires de la Gatienne_,\r\nsacrificed a forest for the nave's overroof. The elaborate Flamboyant\r\nfaçade was set up. Jean Papin was its architect, and Jean de Dammartin,\r\nfresh from Le Mans' transept, worked on it. It was begun under\r\nArchbishop Philippe de Coëtquis (1427-41), one of the learned men whom\r\nCharles VII summoned to interrogate Jeanne d'Arc. He pronounced her\r\nentirely sincere.\r\n\r\nIn Tours Cathedral, April, 1429, knelt St. Jeanne for a solemn\r\nbenediction before she went forth to accomplish her feat at Orléans. An\r\nartist of Tours made for her the banner she loved better than her sword.\r\nWhen Tours heard that she was taken prisoner, public prayers were\r\nordered and a procession marched with bare feet, in penitential\r\nintercession for her deliverance. Charles VII had been married in Tours\r\nto his cousin Marie of Anjou, who was, says the modern student, more his\r\nincentive to patriotism than Agnes Sorel. The son of Charles, Louis XI,\r\nalso was married in the cathedral of Tours, and preferred to live in the\r\nenvirons of the ancient ecclesiastic city.\r\n\r\nUnder the saintly Archbishop Robert de Lenoncourt, installed here in\r\n1488, were finished Tours' western portals. Their foliage is tormented,\r\nserrated, and deeply undercut, almost too prodigally and delicately\r\nsculptured for an exterior decoration. The entranceways are to-day shorn\r\nof their imagery, the statues having been shattered in 1562. In the\r\nRenaissance day the façade's twin towers were gracefully topped; _deux\r\nbeaux bijoux_, Henry IV called the belfries of Tours.\r\n\r\nThroughout the Loire region an astounding number of monuments rose\r\nduring the last half of the XV century and the early part of the XVI.\r\nTours was the foyer for a school of sculpture that spread to Le Mans,\r\nAngers, Nantes, Poitiers, and Bourges. From 1480 to 1512 the school of\r\nthe Region-of-the-Loire, as M. Paul Vitry calls it, was at its prime. It\r\nculminated in the ducal tomb at Nantes and the entombments at Solesmes.\r\nDijon, the leader of the first half of the XV century, benefited Tours\r\nby its realism, and the Italian artists, gathered here in the dawn of\r\nthe foreign Renaissance in France, contributed certain qualities. But\r\nthe art of Michel Colombo is predominatingly of the Middle Ages, and a\r\nproduct of Touraine, a measured, contained, and charming art, _de pur\r\nesprit français_. Colombe simplified the draperies of the Franco-Flamand\r\nschool and eschewed the Dijon roughness. His grace is never petty,\r\nhowever, nor his idealism conventional. As the XVI century opened he\r\nmade, in his Tours studio, the statues for the ducal tomb at Nantes. In\r\n1509 his nephew, Guillaume Regnault, sculptured the recumbent images of\r\nthe children of Anne of Brittany and Charles VIII for the sarcophagus,\r\nnow in the cathedral of Tours, the base of which was covered with\r\narabesques by Jerome of Fiesole. Colombo's contemporary, Jehan Fouquet,\r\na son of Tours, delighted in painting the regional types. He decorated\r\nthe walls of Notre-Dame-la-Riche, but his work is lost, though some of\r\nthe dazzling Renaissance windows of that late-Gothic church of Tours\r\nhave survived. A certain Jean Clouet emigrated from Brussels to Tours in\r\nthose days, and his son and grandson, born by the Loire, are two of the\r\nFrench _primitifs_ whose work the traveler does not care to miss in any\r\ngallery that can boast their Holbein-like canvases. During the\r\nRevolution, plans were afoot to destroy the cathedral of Tours, but two\r\nartists of the city (so loyal through centuries to art interests) risked\r\ntheir lives to save their noble Gothic church.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF LYONS.[158]\r\n\r\n     What Christian does not approach with veneration this city that was\r\n     in France the cradle of the true religion, and where amid\r\n     persecutions and tortures rose for the first time the Cross of\r\n     Christ? Who does not tread with veneration the soil impregnated\r\n     with the blood of so many martyrs and forever consecrated by the\r\n     glories of a see that justly claims the title Primate of\r\n     Gaul?--CHARLES DE MONTALEMBERT, visiting Lyons in 1831.\r\n\r\nIn its early Christian memories Lyons outrivals all other cities of\r\nFrance. It claims a clear apostolic tradition, and boasts that, next to\r\nRome, it shed most Christian blood witnessing to the planting of the\r\nCross. And modern Lyons is the center of the Society for the Propagation\r\nof the Faith, which sends forth to non-Christian lands more missionaries\r\nthan any other group in western Christendom--apostles who obey the\r\nmandate given to Lyons' first martyr-bishops: Go, teach ye all nations,\r\nbaptizing in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\r\n\r\nImperial Rome, that foreshadowed many things, chose Lyons, before the\r\nbirth of Christ, as starting point for her network of highways and\r\naqueducts over Gaul. Augustus made it the capital of Celtic Gaul. It was\r\nthe bishop of Smyrna, St. Polycarp (d. A.D. 166), the disciple of St.\r\nJohn the Beloved (d. A.D. 100), who sent the first two bishops of Lyons\r\nto Christianize Gaul, Pothinus (d. A.D. 177), an Asiatic Greek, and\r\nIrenæus (d. A.D. 202), one of the most remarkable writers of the early\r\nChristian era, lettered in Greek literature and writing in Greek. With\r\nprofound knowledge of Christian doctrine, he advocated, for the guidance\r\nof the Church, tradition, or the spoken word of the Apostles, as well as\r\ntheir written word. Often with just pride did Irenæus boast that his\r\ndoctrine came direct from the contemporaries of the Saviour: \"I could\r\ndescribe to you the very spot where the blessed Polycarp sat when he\r\npreached God's word.... His discourse to the people is engraved in my\r\nheart. He had talked with John and the others who saw the Lord.\"\r\n\r\nFor twenty years St. Irenæus served as priest in Lyons under Bishop\r\nPothinus, and then when that holy prelate, at ninety years of age, was\r\nmartyred during the persecutions of the Christians under Marcus\r\nAurelius, Irenæus went to Rome to be consecrated primate of Gaul in his\r\nplace. When the pagan judge asked Pothinus who was the Christians' God,\r\nthe aged man made answer: \"Merit him and you will know him.\" For twenty\r\nyears, till his death in 202, St. Irenæus evangelized the country with\r\nsuch success that Lyons was almost a Christian city when the persecution\r\nof Septimus Severus broke out. Then followed evil days when the streets\r\nof Lyons ran red with blood, and her learned bishop perished with\r\nnineteen thousand Christian martyrs.\r\n\r\nDuring the first persecution, in 177, the Christians of the city wrote a\r\nfamous letter describing how forty-eight of their number were tortured\r\nday after day in the Roman Forum of Lyons, till even the pagans allowed\r\nthat never a woman had suffered so much and so long as the fragile slave\r\nBlandina. The letter of \"the servitors of Christ who inhabit Vienne and\r\nLyons in Gaul, to the brothers of Asia and Phrygia who partake of our\r\nFaith and our hope in the Redemption,\" is not only an historical\r\ndocument, precious for Lyons, but, as Renan said, is \"one of the most\r\nextraordinary pages that any literature possesses.\"[159]\r\n\r\nThe hill of Fourvière looms over the scene of the martyrdoms, the _forum\r\nvetus_, the forum of Trajan, which gave its name to the neighboring\r\neminence to which many generations have come as to a pilgrimage shrine.\r\nOn the flank of the hill a hospice marks where St. Pothinus breathed his\r\nlast. The sumptuous new basilica that stands on the crest of the hill\r\nbeside an ancient chapel, now its annex, persistently dominates the old,\r\ngray city. Lyons fulfilled its war vow of 1870 by the erection of this\r\nchurch wherein are strange echoes of Greek, Sicilian, Byzantine, and\r\nGothic art that surely will make archæologists in the far future wonder\r\nat much in our civilization. On its walls the city's proud apostolic\r\ntraditions are set forth in mosaics.\r\n\r\nEqually venerated is the ancient church of St. Martin d'Ainay which\r\nmarks the holy ground where many of the martyrs were slaughtered at the\r\nconfluence of the Saône and the Rhone. There once had stood the temple\r\nof the sixty nations of Gaul consecrated to the glory of Augustus.\r\nHaunted by imperial visions, Napoleon at St. Helena suggested that his\r\nburial site be where the Rhone met the Saône. No city is more nobly\r\ngirdled than Lyons. From the altar to Augustus came the four pillars at\r\nthe transept crossing of St. Martin's; two lofty classic columns were\r\ncut in two to make them. The Burgundian queen, Brunehaut, of tragic\r\nmemory, rebuilt Ainay's original oratory over the Christian martyrs'\r\nbones, and founded the monastery which is one of the oldest in France.\r\nIn the course of time it became affiliated with the world-power, Cluny.\r\nThe present church of St. Martin was blessed in 1106 by Paschal II, who\r\non this same journey had dedicated various new basilicas in northern\r\nItaly. In the XII and XIII centuries St. Martin's outer aisles were\r\nadded. The crypt under the chapel of Ste. Blandine is not later than the\r\nV century. A contemporary of St. Martin's is the little Romanesque\r\nbuilding touching the cathedral's façade, the _Manécanterie_ (to sing in\r\nthe morning).[160] Originally it formed the outer wall of a gallery of\r\nthe cloister.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. John the Baptist faces the hill of Fourvière and\r\nits apse overlooks the Saône. The Baptist was the first teacher of St.\r\nJohn Evangelist to whom the city traces its Christianity. A preceding\r\nRomanesque cathedral, building in 1084 and completed by 1117, was\r\ndestroyed during disorders between the two warring local authorities,\r\nthe archbishop and the counts of Forez. Lyons for a time was under the\r\ntitular jurisdiction of the Holy Roman Empire, but to all intents and\r\npurposes was a free city with well developed communal rights. While the\r\nRomanesque cathedral was building, St. Anselm of Canterbury passed\r\nsixteen months in Lyons as guest of Archbishop Hugues.\r\n\r\nThe present cathedral was undertaken by Archbishop Guichard (1165-80),\r\nand in its foundation walls were incorporated some of the polished\r\nstones from the forum of Trajan, hallowed by the martyrs' blood. So\r\nthick were the apse walls made that flying buttresses were never needed.\r\nThe windows were set in deep embrasures. The absence of an ambulatory,\r\nand the flat roof, are reminders that this city neighbors the Midi. The\r\ncathedral's apse, as seen from across the Saône, is admirable. Over the\r\narms of the transept are towers whose breadth indicates that the tower\r\nof St. Martin d'Ainay created a school in the district. In comparison\r\nwith the transept towers, the western belfries of the cathedral appear\r\nmeager.\r\n\r\nThe nave of Lyons rises twenty-five feet above the choir, and,\r\nfurthermore, is covered by an inappropriate high-pitched roof. Within\r\nthe church, the difference in height between the two main parts has been\r\ngracefully veiled by piercing, in the flat wall over the triumphal arch\r\nof the choir, a rose window and two lancets. In size this church may be\r\nmodest, but its sincere, grave dignity is such that the impression\r\nconveyed is that of a very great cathedral. The nave derived from the\r\nnorth. The choir emanated from the south, and its creamy, sculptured\r\nmarbles and Greco-Italian incrustations compose an interior of sober\r\nelegance, the peer of any sanctuary in the land. A unique feature in\r\nFrance is Lyons' incrustations--patterns cut in white marble and filled\r\nin with a reddish-brown cement--found only here and in the cathedral of\r\nVienne.[161] St. Sophia in Constantinople first used the decoration,\r\nwhich was imported into Italy and thence passed up the Rhone.\r\n\r\nThe choir of Lyons' Cathedral, up to its vault-springing, is Romanesque,\r\nof the Burgundian and Provençal type. The classic pilaster strips are\r\nchanneled; on each arm of the transept is an apsidal chapel. The prelate\r\nwho began it, Guichard, had, while abbot of Pontigny, been the host of\r\nSt. Thomas Becket, and in Pontigny's church he was buried in 1180. His\r\nsuccessor, Jean de Bellesmaine (1180-93), born in Canterbury, was\r\nanother of Becket's friends, and soon after he was transferred here from\r\nthe see of Poitiers, then under English rule, he inspired the building\r\nof a collegiate church dedicated to the new English saint. Archbishop\r\nJohn undertook the second campaign of works on Lyons' choir, which was\r\nnow vaulted in the Gothic way. On the capitals of the upper walls are\r\nthe familiar crockets of the north.\r\n\r\nIn the transept is to be seen the same change from the round arches and\r\nfluted pilaster strips of the Romanesque day to the Primary Gothic\r\ncharacteristics. During the first third of the XIII century the transept\r\nwas vaulted, its two towers raised, and the choir's four easternmost\r\nbays built. Lyons was then governed by one of its best rulers,\r\nArchbishop Renaud de Forez, who laid here the base for several centuries\r\nof prosperity. Circumstances forced him into the position of a leader of\r\narmies, but his natural inclination led him to the cloister's peace to\r\nend his days. In 1226, as president of a free city, he received Louis\r\nVIII, shortly before that king's sudden death.\r\n\r\nThis capable churchman presented to his cathedral the seven magnificent\r\nlancets in the curving sanctuary wall, that glow with the sparkling\r\njewel-radiance achieved before 1220, but never equaled afterwards. The\r\nwindows at Lyons are linked with those at Sens, and Sens' lancets we\r\nknow to have been related to the earlier school of Chartres. What\r\ndifferentiates Lyons' medallions from those in the north was their use\r\nof certain Byzantine arrangements, such as the Virgin reclining on a\r\ncouch in the Bethlehem grotto, or the representing St. John with a\r\nbeard.\r\n\r\nThe first light in the Lyons' chevet celebrates the local martyrs. The\r\naxis window is a New Alliance, wherein the Old Law symbolizes the New.\r\nThe meaning of its animal allegories was first explained by Père Cahier,\r\nwho observed that they were taken from the ancient book called the\r\n_Bestiaires_. M. Mâle further discovered that Lyons' New Alliance window\r\nshowed only those animals spoken of in Honoré d'Autun's popular _Mirror\r\nof the Church_. Honoré, who taught in Autun's cathedral school early in\r\nthe XII century, was the initiator of animal symbolism in French\r\ncathedrals.\r\n\r\nIn the upper lights of Lyons' choir are some XIII-century archaic\r\nfigures of big gaunt patriarchs with strange white eyes. The upper\r\nchoir's triplet windows of different heights are most artistic. Under\r\nthe north rose of the transept is a large lancet of surpassing effect,\r\nand in the transeptal chapel, close by, is a window that is like a\r\nsublimated topaz. The small pieces of glass used, their varied\r\nthicknesses and roughnesses are causes producing such sparkle. One\r\ncannot stress too strongly the exceptional character of Lyons' glass.\r\nCenturies later, in the Flamboyant day, this city produced again a bevy\r\nof notable masters.\r\n\r\nThe nave of Lyons Cathedral advanced, bay by bay, in slow progress all\r\nthrough the XIII century, and sculpture and tracery in triforium and\r\nclearstory show the gradual change to Rayonnant design. The nave of\r\nnorthern Gothic conformed itself with sound instinct to the Romanesque\r\nsouthern choir. This is a cathedral that kneels more than it soars. The\r\nancient city exulted on Fourvière's hill, but it thought best to keep\r\nits cathedral as a solemn cenotaph for its white army of unburied\r\nmartyrs.\r\n\r\nThere came to Lyons, while its nave was building, the great Englishman,\r\nRobert Grosseteste (d. 1253), who at Lincoln made an angel-choir, \"one\r\nof the loveliest of man's works,\" to shrine the relics of his\r\npredecessor, St. Hugh of Avalon, born in this semi-southern region. And\r\nmany another enthusiast for the art of the builder studied the nave of\r\nLyons in the course of its construction. Here gathered in 1245 a general\r\nCouncil of the Church. Modern congresses are sometimes dull affairs, but\r\nthey must have been thrilling in the days when cathedrals were building\r\nand each prelate championed his regional ideas and yet looked about\r\neagerly to seize on new ones.\r\n\r\nThe two westernmost bays of Lyons Cathedral were finished by 1310, and\r\nthen were sculptured the façade portals with hundreds of little panels\r\nas full of frolic and fancy as the marginal gaieties of illuminated\r\nmissals. A few years earlier the transept doors at Rouen had made\r\nsimilar medallions. Vice in them was rendered hateful. Where Lot's story\r\nshould have been was left a blank space. Not until Flemish realism\r\nentered French art, in the XV century, were certain gross scenes\r\nrendered. The medallions at Lyons are \"Gaulois but without obscenity.\"\r\n\r\nFrom 1308 to 1332 the wide, plain west façade of St. Jean's cathedral\r\nwas done. Two of the Avignon popes were crowned here in those days,\r\nClement V, the builder of Bordeaux's choir, and John XXII. The great\r\ndukes of the west, Philippe le Hardi and his son Jean sans Peur, being\r\nhereditary canons of the cathedral, often sat in its choir stalls. Of\r\ntheir time is the astronomical clock in the transept. For ten years,\r\nprior to 1429, Jean Gerson lived in the old Christian city, teaching\r\nlittle children their catechism, and the only payment he craved was that\r\nthey should pray: Lord have mercy on your poor servant Gerson. He had\r\nbeen worsted by his century's treachery, bloodshed, foreign rule, and\r\nchurch schism; but after his death Lyons revered him as a saint, and\r\ncarved his device, _Sursum Corda_, on a chapel in the church of St.\r\nPaul. Scholars have decided against Gerson as author of the _Imitation\r\nof Christ_, yet during two centuries he was so believed to be, and his\r\nmemory will be dear to those who have found inspiration in that precious\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nLyons played so important a part in the revival of late-Gothic art that\r\nit was called the French Florence. Its new school of glassmakers\r\ndecorated the church of Brou, at Bourg-en-Bresse, not far away.[162] Two\r\nelaborate Flamboyant Gothic tombs were put up in the cathedral--that of\r\nArchbishop de Saluces (d. 1419) by Jacques Morel, and that of Cardinal\r\nCharles de Bourbon, a grandson of John the Fearless of Burgundy, and son\r\nof the Bourbon duke commemorated by the Souvigny tomb. From 1486 to\r\n1501, he and his brother Pierre de Bourbon, son-in-law of Louis XI,\r\nadded to Lyons Cathedral the splendid chapel of their name whose walls\r\nare carved with their winged stag and the device Espérance.\r\nUnfortunately the windows, made by the Lyons master Pierre de la Paix,\r\nexist no longer, save a few upper panels, in one of which is an angel of\r\nrare beauty holding the Bourbon arms. Frequently in France one meets the\r\ndonations of Henry IV's art-loving forbears, at Chartres, Tours,\r\nSouvigny,[163] Champigny-sur-Veude. Henry was married in Lyons\r\nCathedral, in 1600, to Marie de Medici, daughter of another line of\r\nconnoisseurs.\r\n\r\nLike many a cathedral of France, Lyons was at its richest when it was\r\nsacked most piteously both in 1560 and 1562. Every church in the city\r\nwas devastated by the cruel Baron des Adrets, who led the Huguenots one\r\nyear, the Catholics the next, for in those bitter civil wars religion\r\nwas often the thinnest cloak. The Huguenots destroyed the tomb of\r\nCardinal de Saluces, with its eighteen alabaster statuettes, smashed the\r\nBourbon chapel and tomb, broke up the Flamboyant rood screen, and\r\ndragged through the streets a silver statue of Christ that had\r\nsurmounted it. On the west façade some fifty large statues were brought\r\ndown, though happily the lovely little scenes chiseled under their\r\nbrackets were spared. It is told how an archer shattered Our Lady's\r\nimage, but when he attempted to dislodge that of God the Father, on the\r\npignon, it fell and killed him. Lyons was again the scene of saturnalian\r\nhavoc during the Revolution, when by the thousand her citizens were\r\nmowed down with grape shot because they chose to adhere to the old\r\nrégime. A passageway was broken open in the walls of the cathedral to\r\npermit the entry of a chariot bearing the Goddess of Reason.\r\n\r\nOf all the happenings in Lyons Cathedral, the most momentous was the\r\nEcumenical Council of 1274. Christendom never witnessed a greater\r\ngathering. At the Council held at Lyons in 1245, Innocent IV had\r\npreached his famous sermon on the five wounds of the Church, but he was\r\nless concerned with healing them than with excommunicating Frederick II.\r\nSt. Louis tried in vain to make peace between pope and emperor on his\r\nvisit to Lyons in those days. When the saint-king died on his last\r\ncrusade his ashes rested in honor in Lyons Cathedral on their long\r\njourney from Tunis to St. Denis. Till the death of Frederick II, the\r\npope lived in Lyons, whose independent position, neither wholly of\r\nFrance nor of the Empire, caused it to be a chosen spot for exiles.\r\nInnocent contributed toward the building of a stone bridge over the\r\nRhone to replace one that had collapsed under the troops of\r\nPhilippe-Auguste and Coeur-de-Lion as they marched to the Third\r\nCrusade.\r\n\r\nThe Council of 1245 had been held in a cathedral of whose nave only four\r\nbays were completed. For the far greater gathering of 1274, Lyons\r\nCathedral could seat over two thousand prelates and princes. The chief\r\nvisitors were placed in the choir with Gregory X (formerly a canon of\r\nthis church). Among them was Aragon's king, Jaime el Conquistador,\r\nmighty builder of churches and untiring crusader, Guy de la Tour, the\r\nbishop-builder of Clermont Cathedral, and the bishop of Mende, Guillaume\r\nDurandus, author of the universally read liturgical treatise. St.\r\nBonaventure, whose book of meditations was soon to inspire Giotto,\r\npreached at the opening Mass. His fellow teacher in Paris University,\r\nSt. Thomas Aquinas, journeying north to attend the congress at Lyons,\r\nhad died suddenly in the prime of life.\r\n\r\nThe Council of 1274 was not political, as had been that of 1245; its\r\nmain purposes were the Holy War in the East and the reconciliation of\r\nthe Greek and Latin churches. The Emperor of Constantinople had sent\r\nofficials to reconcile him with Rome, and to this day memorials of that\r\nshort reunion--Greek and Latin processional crosses--stand behind the\r\nchief altar of Lyons Cathedral. The emperor's ambassadors solemnly\r\nabjured the twenty-six propositions condemned by Rome, then took the\r\noath of fidelity to the pope. With swelling heart the vast throng rose\r\nto chant the _Te Deum_. Gregory X intoned the _Credo_ in Latin, and the\r\nGreek patriarch repeated thrice the _Filioque_ phrase which, centuries\r\nearlier, had been the occasion of the break with Rome, _qui ex Patre\r\nFilioque procedit_. Before the century ended the union was a\r\ndead-letter, though the emperor till his death remained faithful to his\r\npact. The Greek priesthood proved irreconcilable.\r\n\r\nThe day before the Council closed St. Bonaventure died, and around his\r\ngrave, in the Franciscan church at Lyons, stood the most imposing group\r\nof mourners recorded in history, pope, kings, and five hundred princes\r\nand prelates of note. The sermon was preached by Bonaventure's pupil of\r\nthe Paris schoolroom, the learned Pierre de Tarentaise, archbishop of\r\nLyons, soon to mount Peter's chair as Innocent V. All Christendom was\r\nbidden to offer up a prayer for the soul of Brother Bonaventure. The\r\ncity adopted him as a patron. In 1562 the ashes of the Seraphic Doctor\r\nwere flung into the Rhone, but there still stands in Lyons a late-Gothic\r\nchurch that bears his name.\r\n\r\n\r\nLE MANS CATHEDRAL[164]\r\n\r\n     A cathedral is a book, a poem, and Christianity, true to its\r\n     promise, has drawn voice and song from stone, _lapides\r\n     clamabunt_.--FRÉDÉRIC OZANAM.\r\n\r\nLike Bourges and Lyons, the cathedral of Le Mans shows the influence of\r\ndifferent schools. An Angevin architect made the _bombé_ vaults of its\r\nnave, and from the Ile-de-France and Normandy came the masters who\r\ndesigned its mammoth choir. The nave of Le Mans is a masterpiece of\r\nRomanesque despite its diagonals; the choir a masterpiece of Apogee\r\nGothic. In the nave appear different stages of pre-Gothic art, and in\r\nthe choir, the transept, and the nave's masonry roof are\r\nrepresented--Primary, Apogee, Rayonnant, and Flamboyant Gothic.\r\n\r\nTo read the stones of this composite church with intelligence, one must\r\ntrace its story step by step. It is named after the first bishop of the\r\ncity, St. Julian, who brought Christianity into the region. Several\r\nearlier cathedrals succeeded each other on the site. The one erected\r\nafter the Northmen sacked Le Mans was falling into ruin when, about\r\n1060, Bishop Vulgrim began a new cathedral, carried on by his successor,\r\nArnould. Their Romanesque choir exists no longer, but vestiges of the\r\nchurch are to be traced in the walls of the present nave, and in the\r\ngable of the Psallette, a building to the north of the cathedral, which\r\nin Bishop Vulgrim's day formed part of his transept's north tower.\r\n\r\nThe nave of Le Mans as we have it to-day shows three distinct campaigns\r\nof work undertaken by the three bishops, Hoël, Hildebert de Lavardin,\r\nand Guillaume de Passavant. Bishop Hoël (1085-97), a Breton, able,\r\nhandsome, patriotic, continued the Romanesque transept and the towers\r\nthat terminate its arms. His works exist in the base of the southern\r\ntower and also in those two pier arcades of the nave that touch the\r\ntransept. The groin vaulting of the side aisles is of Hoël's time, as\r\nwell as the aisle walls, decorated with blind arcades, the capitals of\r\nwhose shafts are carved crudely with chimerical animals. As the capitals\r\nopposite those of the engaged shafts show more skill, they must have\r\nbeen done later in the XI century.\r\n\r\nGood Bishop Hoël, in famine time, sold the gold and silver plate of his\r\ncathedral to feed the poor, and on his deathbed distributed his\r\npossessions among them. After a visit to Rome, he accompanied Urban II\r\nback to France, on the momentous occasion of the launching of the First\r\nCrusade. When the Council of Clermont ended, the pope came to Le Mans,\r\nin February of 1096, to visit his friend the bishop, to the intense\r\npride of all the city. Such episodes reflect clearly the unison of\r\naspiration which was presently to express itself in mighty movements.\r\nThe Greek princess who saw the first crusaders arrive in Constantinople\r\nhas told in graphic phrases how Europe, unloosed from its foundations,\r\nhurled itself on Asia, and with a like impetuosity western Christendom\r\nwas about to fling itself toward heaven in cathedrals.\r\n\r\nThe church on which Bishop Hoël had worked was destroyed in large part\r\nby fire, and his successor, the illustrious Hildebert de Lavardin\r\n(1097-1125), began a reconstruction about 1110. Hildebert was the most\r\npopular poet of his day and in the mediæval schools his letters were\r\ncommitted to memory. A lover of the Latin authors, he composed verses of\r\nsuch facture that some of them have been mistaken for ancient classics.\r\nHe was philosopher, orator, and architect as well. The best years of his\r\nlife were passed in Le Mans, though he was to die in Tours as archbishop\r\nof that city. While a teacher in Le Mans' cathedral school, he\r\naccompanied Bishop Hoël on his travels, and knew well Cluny and its\r\ngreat abbot Hugues, whose biographer he became. Hildebert possessed\r\n_esprit_, a sound judgment, and much independence. Life tested him\r\nharshly. The ordeal of prison he suffered several times, and the\r\nworse ordeal of calumny, which is disproved by the affectionate\r\nfriendship felt for him by St. Anselm, St. Bernard, and Bishop Ives of\r\nChartres. No man, he himself said in one of his sermons, should be a\r\nbishop whose life has not always been irreproachable. His contemporaries\r\ncalled him \"a prelate attentive to the distribution of the bread of the\r\nword of God,\" a man zealous for discipline, charitable to the poor, and\r\nwith a love for the House of Prayer that made him a builder both at Le\r\nMans and Tours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Le Mans' Choir_ (_1217-1254_). _The Double Aisles_]\r\n\r\nLike St. Anselm, he was bullied by William Rufus. Maine lay between\r\nAnjou and Normandy and was fought for by each of those expanding powers,\r\na duel settled only by the marriage of the heiress of Maine to the heir\r\nof Anjou, the son of which union was Geoffrey the Handsome, the first\r\nPlantagenet so called, who married the heiress of Normandy and England.\r\nGeoffrey's son, Henry II of England, inherited Maine, Anjou, and\r\nNormandy before he fell heir to the kingdom across the Channel.\r\n\r\nWhen William Rufus captured Le Mans in 1097, he exacted the demolition\r\nof the cathedral's towers on the charge that they dominated his\r\nresidence. Annoyed that Hildebert had been elected bishop without his\r\ndeciding voice, he pillaged his palace, confiscated his possessions, and\r\nkept him chained in prison for a year. The bishop was imprisoned as well\r\nby Maine's designing neighbor to the south, the Count of Anjou, and once\r\nwhile in the south of France he almost met death at the hands of Saracen\r\npirates.\r\n\r\nDespite vicissitudes, he found time for writing poetry and for building.\r\nHe obtained a monk-architect named Jean from the noted Geoffrey, abbot\r\nof Vendôme,[165] author, writer, and the intimate of many popes. Later,\r\nwhen Abbot Geoffrey asked for the return of his architect, Hildebert\r\nretained him, and a tart letter of the abbot to the bishop exists; it\r\nappears that monk Jean was sent, in consequence, on a penitential\r\npilgrimage to Palestine. Bishop Hildebert's part in Le Mans' actual\r\ncathedral is the semicircular pier arches discernible in all the bays of\r\nthe nave save the two touching the transept, the alternate circular\r\npiers, and the west façade, wherein were retained older portions, and\r\nagainst which leans a big menhir of immemorial age: \"_Il y a dans la\r\ncathédrale toute la simple beauté du menhir qui l'annonce_,\" is one of\r\nRodin's vivifying phrases.\r\n\r\nBishop Hildebert consecrated his new cathedral in 1120, and it is\r\nrelated how, on that day, Fulk V of Anjou, the widower of the heiress of\r\nMaine, about to start for the Holy Land, set his little son of seven,\r\nGeoffrey, on the high altar of Le Mans Cathedral, and said with emotion:\r\n\"O holy Julian, to thee I commend my child and my lands. Defend and\r\nprotect them both.\" His prowess in Palestine was eventually to win for\r\nhim the heiress of Jerusalem, so that when he had married his son\r\nGeoffrey to a woman of great fortune, he sensibly left him as sole ruler\r\nin Maine and Anjou, contenting himself with his Oriental kingdom.\r\n\r\nTwo fires in quick succession damaged the Romanesque cathedral of Le\r\nMans. Ordericus Vitalis tells how \"in the first week of September, 1134,\r\nthe hand of God punished many sins by fire, for the ancient and wealthy\r\ncities of Le Mans and Chartres were burned.\" In the necessary changes\r\nthat followed practically all the central nave was redone by Bishop\r\nGuillaume de Passavant (1145-86). The triforium, the clearstory, and the\r\nmasonry roof are his, and he constructed the pointed arches under the\r\nsemicircular ones of Bishop Hildebert's pier arcade. The four immense\r\nsquare vault sections (c. 1150) over Le Mans' nave are of the heavy rib\r\nPlantagenet type, like the so-called domical vaults of Angers Cathedral.\r\nTheir crown, or keystone, being ten feet higher than their framing\r\narches, a pronounced concave shape results. The addition of a heavy\r\nstone roof necessitated the englobing of each alternate monolithic\r\ncolumn by a square pier cantoned with shafts.\r\n\r\nBishop Guillaume developed the door in the south flank of the nave,\r\nwhose column images, though much mutilated, are allied with those at\r\nChartres' western entrances. At the door joints, in bas-relief only, are\r\nPeter and Paul; an additional step was taken when the other images were\r\nmade to stand almost free of their columns. Guglielmo, the Lombard, had\r\nused jamb-sculpture at Modena Cathedral as the XII century opened. This\r\ndoor of Le Mans, among the earliest of French imaged portals, belongs to\r\nthe decade before 1150. The porch leading to it was built in time for\r\nthe consecration of the cathedral in 1158.\r\n\r\nGuillaume de Passavant was another of the outstanding men of his age.\r\nHe, too, wrote Latin verses, and even as he lay dying composed a little\r\nsatire on his attendants, whom his clear eyes observed to be more\r\nconcerned over the coming recompense from his estate than for the loss\r\nof their bishop. Like St. Bernard, who had loved him as a youth, he was\r\na tireless reader of the Bible. Daily at his table the poor were fed. He\r\npresented to his cathedral a cloth of gold studded with gems, for which\r\nhe wrote verses, saying that in case of famine it was to be sold to feed\r\nthe destitute. Another princely gift he gave to Le Mans Cathedral was\r\nthe enameled tomb of Count Geoffrey the Handsome, of which only one\r\nlarge panel has survived, now the treasure of the Museum. Both kinds of\r\nenamel were used, the flat surface, or champlevé, and the cloisonné\r\nmethod. The technique is Limousin, not, as some have said, Rhenish;\r\nbetween Le Mans and Limoges were many links.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey the Handsome was the thirteenth count of Anjou, though the\r\ncapital of Maine was always his favorite residence, rather than Angers,\r\nthe chief city of his father's patrimony. He won the nickname\r\n\"Plantagenet\" because of the sprig of broom he used to stick in his cap.\r\nTrue to his race's instinct for territorial aggrandizement, he married,\r\nwhen not yet twenty, a woman twice his age, Matilda, daughter of Henry I\r\nof England, the Conqueror's son. Geoffrey died in 1151 on his return\r\nfrom the Second Crusade, where he had fought for his half brother,\r\nBaudouin III, king of Jerusalem. His son, Henry II, was born in Le Mans\r\n(1133) and baptized in its cathedral. Henry had revered Guillaume de\r\nPassavant from childhood, yet once, in an Angevin passion, because the\r\naged bishop had crossed his will, he sent messengers from England to\r\norder the sacking of the prelate's palace. Thomas Becket, then Henry's\r\nchancellor, gave secret advice to the envoys to tarry long on their\r\njourney to Maine. On the third day after their departure he wrung from\r\nthe king, who fancied his order was already carried out, a\r\ncounter-order, which he rushed through to Le Mans.\r\n\r\nHenry Plantagenet loved Le Mans better than any city in his wide\r\ndominions, and his heart broke when his rebellious son, Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion, drove him out in 1189. Two months later he died in\r\nChinon castle and was carried for burial to Fontevrault; the ancient\r\nprophecy had said that Anjou's ruler of his generation would lie\r\nshrouded among the shrouden women.\r\n\r\nIf Fulk Nerra's wild blood had passed to Henry, so had his shrewdness\r\nand progressive statesmanship. He, too, like his father, before twenty,\r\nwedded a woman much older than himself, the richest heiress in\r\nChristendom, Aliénor of Aquitaine. Possessing Anjou, Maine, and\r\nTouraine, Normandy and Aquitaine, this king of England ruled more\r\nterritory in France than did the French king. And Philippe-Auguste, son\r\nof the French monarch, whom Aliénor had discarded, bent his resourceful\r\ngenius and fox-like policies to change so abnormal a state of affairs.\r\nThe Capet-Plantagenet duel was to last for centuries.\r\n\r\nBoth Henry and Philippe were munificent patrons of the new\r\narchitecture. Henry sponsored that individual phase of it called\r\nPlantagenet Gothic; under Philippe, French Gothic reached its highest\r\ndevelopment. And the cathedral of Le Mans records them both, Plantagenet\r\nin its nave, northern French in its choir. When Maine, Anjou, and\r\nTouraine, because of John Lackland's crimes, passed willingly to the\r\nFrench king, the art of the Ile-de-France found favor in southwest\r\nFrance. Then it was that the XI-century Romanesque chevet of Le Mans\r\nCathedral was replaced by the present stupendous Gothic choir.\r\n\r\nIn 1217 Bishop Hamlin obtained the consent of Philippe-Auguste to\r\ndestroy the Gallo-Roman city walls in order to extend the apse of his\r\nchurch, and the next year the choir was started. The bishop, trowel in\r\nhand, spent hours on the new work. His two successors continued the\r\nenterprise. From 1234 to 1255 Bishop Geoffrey de London was its princely\r\nbenefactor. In 1254 the choir was dedicated, \"a day of benediction\" for\r\nour land, said the people with tears of fervor. Men and women worked\r\nvoluntarily to clear the edifice of builders' rubbish, even the little\r\nchildren of four carrying out the sand in their frocks. For the happy\r\nceremony, each guild of the city, chanting psalms, brought a candle of\r\ntwo-hundred-pound weight, to be set up in a majestic circle round the\r\nhigh altar.\r\n\r\nThe choir, then blessed for God's service, is one of the vast designs of\r\nGothic architecture. \"Words are powerless to paint the majesty of this\r\nsanctuary,\" wrote M. Gonse. Here, as at Bourges, is the note of dream\r\nbeauty that haunts the memory, the something mysterious and\r\nsuperlatively picturesque. Were the church completed on the same scale\r\nit would rank with the supreme cathedrals of France. From the exterior\r\nthe contrast between the XII-century nave and its towering neighbor is\r\npainfully abrupt. The nave's outer walls are stark and unadorned, the\r\nround arched windows insignificant in size. But who would be willing to\r\nforfeit the venerable monument built by the poet-theologians, Hildebert\r\nde Lavardin and Guillaume de Passavant, wherein history has been lived,\r\nand whose interior aspect is of so grave, white, and primeval a\r\nsimplicity?\r\n\r\nOverawing in size is Le Mans' Gothic choir. The ground falls away to the\r\ncast of the church, and then opens out in the Place des Jacobins, whence\r\ncan be obtained an unobstructed view of the stupendous edifice. Its\r\nnumerous apse chapels are of exceptional length. The forked flying\r\nbuttresses allowed the insertion of ambulatory windows. As at Bourges\r\nand Coutances, the inner aisle is sufficiently high to possess its own\r\ntriforium and clearstory, but Le Mans improved on Bourges by omitting\r\naltogether the triforium of its middle choir in order not to dwarf its\r\nclearstory.\r\n\r\nArchæologists have traced the handiwork of three different men in Le\r\nMans' choir. First, an architect of the Ile-de-France made the general\r\nplan, and built the thirteen radiating chapels. Then a Norman worked on\r\nthe eastern curve, and it is thought he was Thomas Toustain, cited here\r\nas master-of-works, since Toustain is a Norman name. Perhaps he was the\r\nsame genius who had already planned the high inner aisle at Coutances\r\nCathedral. Very Norman are Le Mans' circular capitals, the sanctuary's\r\ntwin-column piers, the carved band under the clearstory, the\r\nsharp-pointed arches beneath arches, and the foliate sculpture covering\r\nthe spandrels of the aisle's triforium. The third master-of-works must\r\nhave been a native of the Ile-de-France, for the upper choir and the two\r\nbays nearest the transept belong to that school.\r\n\r\nThere is a progressive enlarging of the bays of the choir from its\r\nentrance to its end, done too regularly to have been accidental.\r\nProfessor Goodyear has developed the thesis of these intentional\r\nrefinements in Gothic monuments.[166] Mr. Arthur Kingsley Porter thinks\r\nthat undoubtedly there are cases when it was done with subtle design,\r\nbut more often the irregularities resulted from the sound artistic taste\r\nof the old masters who preferred a free-hand drawing to mechanical\r\nperfection. \"There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness\r\nin the proportion,\" said Bacon. Some think that at Le Mans the desire\r\nwas to counteract the perspective narrowing. Others say that the builder\r\nthought thus to conform the wide choir to the ancient nave of lesser\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\nNot till the day of Rayonnant Gothic was Le Mans' transept begun, and it\r\nproved exceptional in continuing building while the foreign wars ravaged\r\nFrance; the chapter taxed itself heavily to meet expenses. As the XIV\r\ncentury closed, the southern arm was finished; it is entirely blocked by\r\nthe ancient tower, to which were then added two stories. Midway in the\r\nvertical wall of the northern arm (begun in 1403) appears Flamboyant\r\ntracery. As cracks soon showed, the chapter called in a new architect,\r\nJean de Dammartin, whose grandfather and great-uncle had beautified\r\nDijon, Bourges, and Poitiers. When in 1430 the English captured Le Mans,\r\nhe passed to Tours, on whose west façade he worked.\r\n\r\nBecause the Gothic transept of Le Mans was confined to the same space as\r\nthe Romanesque one it replaced, it may seem too narrow for such\r\ntremendous height. It is a monument as stately and cold as the glass it\r\nframes. Window over window rises the fragile audacious sweep of color\r\nthat closes the transept's northern vista, each part being bound by\r\nstone traceries into the monumental whole. White and the yellow produced\r\nby silver-stain is the general theme, with brilliant touches of green,\r\nflashed ruby, violet, and blue. It has been said that what XV-century\r\nglass needs, to give it character, are the strong black cross-hatchings\r\nof the earlier schools. In the row of lights below the big rose, a\r\ndamasked background to the figures was used with good effect. Among\r\nthose represented are good King René, faithful amateur of art, and his\r\nmother, Yolande of Aragon, the regent dowager of Maine and Anjou. Her\r\nson-in-law Charles VII contributed toward the transept of Le Mans.\r\n\r\nFor its wealth of storied windows Le Mans comes second only to Chartres\r\nand Bourges. It has suffered from hail-storms which wrecked many of its\r\nXIII-century treasures. The majority of the choir lights were set up\r\nbetween 1250 and 1260. Those in the radial chapels are somewhat earlier;\r\nin the long Lady chapel is a notable Tree of Jesse. The upper windows,\r\ncontemporaries of those at Tours, have large figures with signatures\r\nthat tell us their donors were canons, Benedictines,[167] Cistercians,\r\narchitects, drapers (the donors of the fourth window), furriers (who\r\ngave the fifth), innkeepers and publicans (who presented the sixth). The\r\nseventh window--in the center of the apse--was the gift of Bishop\r\nGeoffrey de Loudon. In the thirteenth window bakers pour grain into\r\nsacks and take bread from the oven.\r\n\r\nIn the clearstory of the inner aisle the legend-medallion type of window\r\nis retained. The first two bays were filled by Bishop Guillaume Roland\r\n(1255-58) here portrayed. The vintners presented the next light, for, on\r\nthe \"day of benediction\" in 1254, when each of the town guilds brought a\r\ngiant candle, the vintners chose to donate a light that would burn\r\nlonger, so they set up this dazzling window of St. Julian.[168] Over the\r\nentrance to the Lady chapel Bishop Geoffrey is again portrayed, and in\r\nthe eleventh bay Pope Innocent IV appears.\r\n\r\nA hundred years separate Le Mans' splendid specimens of XIII-century art\r\nfrom certain small lancets in the cathedral's nave, made probably by\r\nSuger's own workers of St. Denis, who came here when they had finished\r\nthe three lancets in Chartres' façade. M. Mâle has proved that all the\r\nXII-century windows in the west of France derive from St. Denis. Le\r\nMans' lancets show the same robes, the same borders of medallions as in\r\nthe Suger lights at Chartres. The up-gazing apostles in Poitiers'\r\nCrucifixion window resemble the apostles in Le Mans' Ascension. The\r\nlarge much-restored light in the west façade, relating the story of St.\r\nJulian, though modeled on the St. Denis school, must have been executed\r\nby local craftsmen; it is rougher workmanship than the XII-century\r\nlancets in the nave aisles.\r\n\r\nLe Mans suffered woefully in 1562 when the Huguenots worked their will\r\nfor three months on the cathedral's treasures. A choir screen with three\r\nhundred figures, a contemporary of that at Albi, was demolished, windows\r\nby the dozen were broken, and there was a holocaust of carved altars and\r\ntombs. After the Revolution, the XIII-century tomb of Berengaria of\r\nNavarre, the childless widow of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, was set up in\r\nthe transept. For thirty years, as chatelaine of Le Mans, she watched\r\nits new Gothic sanctuary rising. They have mistakenly called hers the\r\nhouse of a XV-century lawyer in the Grande Rue.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Renaissance tomb in France is in Le Mans Cathedral, that of\r\nKing René's brother, made by Laurana from beyond the Alps. The effigy\r\nreposes in Christian fashion, but near by, on the later tomb of\r\nGuillaume du Bellay, the deceased is represented reclining at ease amid\r\nhis mundane books.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAINTS AT SOLESMES.[169]\r\n\r\n     No one can speak with the Lord while he prattles with the whole\r\n     world.--HILDEBERT DE LAVARDIN, bishop of Le Mans (1097-1125).\r\n\r\nBishop Hoël, who worked on the nave of Le Mans Cathedral, used to retire\r\nfor meditation to the priory of Solesmes, farther down the Sarthe, a\r\nhouse founded in 1010 by the lord of Sablé and given to the Benedictines\r\nof the _Cultura Dei_ at Le Mans. Closed by the Revolution's hurricane,\r\nSolesmes was reopened in 1833 through the devoted efforts of Dom Prosper\r\nGuéranger, who made it a modern Cluny for erudition, for arts and\r\ncrafts, and above all for church music. Solesmes restored to the church\r\nthe Gregorian chant in its purity. Cowled architects of the XIX century\r\nrebuilt their monastery. On their own printing press the monks brought\r\nout books. Guests came here to find peace of mind and inspiration. At\r\nSolesmes Montalembert wrote the noble chapter on the Middle Ages that\r\nprefaces his _History of St. Elizabeth of Hungary_.[170]\r\n\r\nThe traveler from Le Mans to Angers should quit the train at Sablé and\r\nwalk two miles to the now deserted monastery on the Sarthe. In the\r\ntransept of its church are the groups of images called _Les Saints de\r\nSolesmes_, work that ranks with the most vigorous final samples of the\r\nnational art, and that are in spirit profoundly a part still of the\r\nMiddle Ages despite Renaissance arabesques and pilasters.\r\n\r\nWhat master, or masters, made the Solesmes groups has led to animated\r\ncontroversy. They belong to the Region-of-the-Loire school, of which\r\nTours was the center, and, like Michel Colombe's work, in them the harsh\r\nrealism of the preceding school of Burgundy has been softened, and the\r\ndraperies made supple and less overwhelming. If the _Maître de Solesmes_\r\nis not Colombe himself, he was some one trained in his art school at\r\nTours, perhaps some monk in this priory.\r\n\r\nThe entombments at Solesmes are the best of the Middle Ages, with that\r\nof Ligier Richier at St. Mihiel.[171] Interest centers chiefly in the\r\nEntombment of Christ, the earliest and finest group, made about 1496\r\nunder Prior Cheminart, whose crest is cut on the stones. No Holy\r\nSepulcher can compare with this in contained and sustained emotion. Its\r\nclassic moderation is very different from the dramatic, almost violent,\r\nsculpture soon to be made popular by the Renaissance from Italy.\r\n\r\nThe two men who lower the dead Christ into the tomb, Nicodemus (bearded)\r\nand Joseph of Arimathea (shaven, for such was the ritual in the mystery\r\nplays), are powerful images, and the latter is indubitably a portrait\r\nstudy, but of whom is not known. The Christ type could not be nobler.\r\nThe Virgin's grief is rendered without emphasis, and St. John,\r\nsupporting her, is an admirable image. But the supreme saint of Solesmes\r\nis the Magdalene, seated beside the tomb, her head bowed, her lips\r\npressed against her crossed hands. She is garbed in as homely fashion as\r\nher sister Martha in St. Madeleine's church at Troyes--sisters in blood\r\nand sisters by the heart are these two admirable conceptions of\r\nlate-Gothic sculpture. Nothing could be gentler, more discreet, more\r\npoignant in emotion, than the Magdalene of Solesmes, \"the exquisite\r\nflower of the art of the Loire region,\" says M. Paul Vitry, \"one of the\r\nmasterpieces of French imagery of all times.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is alive, she breathes gently,\" wrote Dom Guéranger, \"her silence\r\nis at the same time both grief and a prayer.\" Dom de la Tremblaye asks\r\nwhat Italian master of the Renaissance has rendered faith more\r\nprofoundly than this Magdalene, whose desolation is closer to a smile of\r\necstasy than to the contraction of grief. Even the neo-classic XVII\r\ncentury admired this image, and Richelieu wished to transport it to his\r\nchâteau in Poitou.\r\n\r\nSome fifty years later, while Jean Bougler ruled Solesmes, was made the\r\nBurial of the Virgin, whose setting is entirely of the Renaissance,\r\nthough the imagery remains faithful to the French Gothic spirit. It is\r\nsaid that the monk at Our Lady's feet represents the prior, Jean Bougler\r\n(1515-56), who returned to the lord of Sablé the eternal answer of the\r\nspiritual to the temporal powers. Accosted one day on the bridge over\r\nthe Sarthe by the baron, against whom he had just maintained the\r\npriory's rights, the irate layman cried out: \"Monk, if I did not fear\r\nGod, I should throw you into the Sarthe.\" \"If you fear God,\r\nMonseigneur,\" replied the prior, \"I have nothing to fear.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

The saints buried in its crypts, the cloud of\r\nwitnesses in its window and sculptured groups, listened year after year\r\nto the marching millions, marching in the hope that a better world might\r\nemerge from the chaos, _ready to suffer and die and forgive_.\r\n\r\nSt. Quentin has always stood in the path of invading armies. Much of its\r\nprecious glass was destroyed in 1557, when Philip II of Spain attacked\r\nthe town on St. Laurence day, and in memory of his victory built the\r\nEscorial. The siege of 1870 damaged the city dedicated to Caius\r\nQuintinus, the Roman senator's son who evangelized this region where he\r\nmet a martyr's death. In August of 1914 the invaders passed in swift\r\nadvance on Paris. When the Marne battle drove them back, they dug\r\nthemselves into trenches a mile from St. Quentin's suburbs and there,\r\nwith tragic monotony, the giant battle fluctuated. On August 15, 1917,\r\nsuddenly, like a candle in the night, St. Quentin's great church flamed\r\nup, lighting the country for miles around. The projectiles came from the\r\nsouth where the invaders, not the Allies, were intrenched. From beneath\r\nthis hill, in April of 1918, started the final desperate thrust toward\r\nParis. Four months later the Allies, taking the offensive, swept all\r\nbefore them, and in October the Germans quitted the city in too great\r\nhaste to destroy the big church, as the bored holes in every one of its\r\npiers would indicate had been their intention. A ghost of its former\r\nself is the collegiate of St. Quentin to-day. The venerated crypt, part\r\nof which dated from 840, was blown up with gunpowder before the\r\nevacuation (1918). The notably good XIII-and XV-century windows are\r\nwrecked, and the Flamboyant Gothic Town Hall, close to the church, is a\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nAbout 1115 was begun the present collegiate as a Romanesque edifice; the\r\nnorth arm of the easternmost transept and the side wall between it and\r\nthe larger transept are pre-Gothic. St. Quentin is an exception, in\r\nFrance, in possessing two transepts. When in 1257 St. Louis came to St.\r\nQuentin for the removal of the martyrs' relics to the new crypt, the\r\nGothic choir was completed. Three of the small chambers in the\r\nXIII-century crypt are of Carolingian origin, and vestiges of\r\nCarolingian work remain in the west tower, placed directly before the\r\nchurch, and serving as a kind of vestibule to it. Till the present nave\r\nwas extended to meet that ancient belfry, it stood isolated.\r\n\r\nFissures showed in the new constructions and much time was wasted in\r\nconsolidations. Only as the XIV century opened was the big transept\r\nbetween choir and nave begun; it was made twenty feet wider than the\r\ntransept between apse curve and choir. The tracery in the rose windows\r\nof both cross inclosures is most artistic. The nave continued building\r\nall through the XIV century. It repeated the shafts which, in the choir,\r\nhad been later additions needed for consolidation. Only by 1470 was St.\r\nQuentin's nave completed by joining it to the ancient west tower. Three\r\ndifferent campaigns of work built this church, and three breaks in its\r\naxial line are distinctly visible. Toward its repairs the good king\r\nCharles V contributed, and Louis XI bore the expense of remaking the\r\nsmall transept.\r\n\r\nTo Villard de Honnecourt is attributed the plan of St. Quentin, since\r\nthere are details in his sketchbook--the thirty-three parchment leaves\r\nnow a treasure of the National Library at Paris--to substantiate the\r\nclaim. His annotations are in the Picard dialect. St. Quentin's\r\nordinance followed that of Rheims Cathedral sketched by Villard. The\r\nplanting of columns between axis chapel and ambulatory--a Champagne\r\nfeature--is the kind of charming novelty which would have appealed to\r\nthe eager traveler who, at Kassovie, made a church for the king of\r\nHungary wherein he repeated the unique fan-spreading eastern end of St.\r\nYved at Braine.\r\n\r\nThus he opened his precious book: \"Villard de Honnecourt salutes you,\r\nand he begs all those who work at different classes of studies contained\r\nin these pages, to pray for his soul and remember him, for in this book\r\ncan be found great help in teaching oneself fundamental principles of\r\nmasonry and church carpentry.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPlantagenet Gothic Architecture[174]\r\n\r\n     Il n'y a pas seulement deux principes opposés dans l'homme. Il y en\r\n     a trois. Car il y a trois vies et trois ordres de facultés. Il y a\r\n     trois espèces de dispositions l'âme bien différentes: la première,\r\n     celle de presque tous les hommes, consiste à vivre exclusivement\r\n     dans le monde des phénomènes qu'on prend pour des réalités. La\r\n     deuxième est celle des esprits les plus réfléchis qui cherchent\r\n     longtemps la vérité en eux-mêmes ou dans la nature.... La troisième\r\n     enfin est celle des âmes éclairées des lumières de la religion, les\r\n     seules vrai et immuables. Ceux-là seuls ont trouvé un point d'appui\r\n     fixe.--MAINE DE BIRAN (1766-1825; born in Périgord).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gothic of the southwest grew out of the meeting of the cupola church\r\nof Aquitaine with the intersecting ribbed vault of northern France. It\r\nrose and spread in a region then under Plantagenet rule, Anjou, Poitou,\r\nMaine, and Touraine. As the first known vault of the Angevin type was\r\ndated approximately 1150, and as the system died out about the middle of\r\nthe XIII century, Plantagenet Gothic was but an incident of a hundred\r\nyears in French architecture. However, it was a phase which produced\r\nmonuments of such remarkable individuality and grace that the school\r\ndeserves more notice than has hitherto been given it.\r\n\r\nThe dominant feature in Plantagenet Gothic is its cup-shaped vaulting.\r\nThe French term \"_bombé_\" is more exact than such expressions as\r\n\"domical\" and \"domed.\" The panels of an Angevin vault do not form parts\r\nof a spherical dome. The keystone of each section is raised higher than\r\nthe four arches framing the section. Similar vaults were built during\r\nthe first trials of diagonals by other Gothic schools, in districts\r\nwhere there were no cupola churches to serve as models. They were the\r\nresult of inexperience in constructing ribbed-groined vaults, and their\r\n_bombé_ shape disappeared as soon as architects learned to raise their\r\ntransverse and wall arches, by stilting and pointing them, to the level\r\nof the keystone. While the so-called domical vault in other schools had\r\nbeen a transitional step, in Plantagenet Gothic it was intentionally\r\npersisted in and became the most distinguishing characteristic of the\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nIn principle and in construction, the Plantagenet school is truly\r\nGothic. The cells are carried on the backs of diagonal ribs. The Angevin\r\nbuilders recognized at once the advantage of concentrating the thrust of\r\nthe stone roof at fixed points and counterbutting and grounding the load\r\nat those points only, so they followed close on the northern architects\r\nin adopting the new system. At the same time they felt that the cupola\r\ntradition in their region was not to be wholly set aside. M. Anthyme\r\nSaint-Paul well expressed it when he said that southwestern France\r\n\"_s'est conduit en nation tributaire et non soumise_.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the presence in the Plantagenet\r\nterritories of churches covered by a number of small cupolas encouraged\r\na decided curve in the newly imported diagonals. It was not for nothing\r\nthat near Angers and Saumur, the two cities where Angevin vaults were\r\nfirst constructed, lay the famous abbatial of Fontevrault, a masterpiece\r\nof the cupola school. Had not the arrival, midway in the XII century, of\r\nthe northern French type of masonry roof checked the construction of\r\nsuch churches, it is probable that they would have extended farther\r\nnorth. From the meeting of the two schools developed the Plantagenet\r\nphase of Gothic.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a description of the successive steps taken by\r\nPlantagenet architecture in its best-known examples at Angers, Saumur,\r\nand Poitiers, it is well to touch on the cupola churches of\r\nsouthwestern France, building for a century before the beginning of the\r\nregional Gothic school. M. de Lasteyrie has divided Romanesque\r\narchitecture into some half dozen schools--those of Normandy, Burgundy,\r\nAuvergne, Poitou, the Midi, Champagne, and the scarcely enunciated\r\nPicardy Ile-de-France school. To these he added two isolated\r\ndevelopments of short duration, one typified at Tournus, in Burgundy,\r\nwhere half barrels are placed transversely across a nave; and the other\r\nconsisting of cupola-covered edifices which were building from Saintes\r\nto Fontevrault in the same hour as the Poitou-Romanesque churches\r\nsurrounding them. For three generations the cupola haunted the\r\nimagination of southwestern France. The majority of them came into\r\nexistence by hazard, as it were. They were not in the first plan of the\r\nchurch, but were built to replace other roofs, and in France they have\r\nbeen set on every kind of pedestal.[175] They were a variant of the\r\nbarrel vault of the region preferred because less material was required.\r\n\r\nHow the cupola arrived in Aquitaine is still an open question. M. de\r\nLasteyrie has belittled the explanation of an Oriental source, since the\r\nmode of construction in France differed from that of cupolas in the\r\nEast. His idea is that the use of the cupola never died out from the\r\nearlier days in Gaul, and that the domed churches of France may be\r\nconsidered to be fairly indigenous. M. Enlart has contended that no\r\nmatter how or when the use of the cupola got into France, its origin was\r\nundeniably Byzantine, since Rome took the feature from Byzantium. He\r\nhas dwelt on the fact that it was while such churches were building in\r\nFrance, the men of western Europe were going on pilgrimages, on\r\ncrusades, and on trading ventures into countries where the cupola was a\r\ncommon feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. FRONT AT PÉRIGUEUX.[176]\r\n\r\n     Is it not better to dwell a little sadly far from the world, under\r\n     the hand of God? The world gives but vain pleasures. You will be\r\n     like others beguiled by it and hardened. You will hear many evil\r\n     conversations, you will see many contemptible pushing people with\r\n     distinguished names, you will feel malignant envy, many will be the\r\n     faults with which you will reproach yourself.... Nothing is good\r\n     apart from Peace. Peace is the mark of God's finger. All that is\r\n     not Peace is but illusion, and disturbing self-love.... Be simple\r\n     and insignificant, and Peace will be your reward. It is only you\r\n     yourself who can trouble your own Peace. It is in forgetting self\r\n     that Peace comes.--FÉNELON (1651-1715; born near Périgueux).\r\n\r\nThe most discussed of the cupola churches is St. Front at Périgueux. For\r\na while it was considered a mother church of the school, but such\r\nwell-constructed domes are a culmination, not a beginning. One of the\r\noldest cupolas extant is that of St. Astier, near Périgueux, finished in\r\n1018; there are two large domes over Cahors Cathedral, in which church\r\nPope Calixtus II blessed an altar in 1119.[177] The two cupolas over\r\nCahors' unaisled nave appear in the exterior view, but were not well\r\nenough constructed for their inner surfaces to be left uncovered by\r\ncoats of plaster, whereas the interior masonry of St. Front is\r\nbeautifully finished, proving that in point of time it was separated\r\nfrom St. Astier.\r\n\r\nLong and heated have been the controversies over the date of the\r\ncathedral of Périgueux. As much space has been devoted to the discussion\r\nas to the little Morienval in the Ile-de-France. At first it was taken\r\nto be the church begun before 1000 and dedicated in 1047. To-day no one\r\ndreams of saying it predates the fire of 1120. A few of the bays of the\r\nancient church, burned in 1120 with much loss of life, were retained as\r\nparish rooms and now stand to the south of the present cathedral's\r\nfaçade. It is very evident that they never were intended to be\r\nincorporated in the new church.\r\n\r\nOnce it was thought that the actual St. Front, which is in the shape of\r\na Greek cross, with a dome over each of its arms, copied St. Mark's at\r\nVenice. St. Mark's was modeled on the church of the Apostles at\r\nConstantinople, destroyed by Mohammed II in 1464. However, its domes\r\nwere added only when the basilica was rebuilt, in 1063. And furthermore,\r\nthere are indications at St. Front to show that the original design was\r\nto lengthen its nave by another bay, which would have changed the plan\r\nfrom a Greek cross to the universally used Latin cross.\r\n\r\nThe present St. Front was begun after 1120 and probably was completed by\r\n1180, in which year a record says that Bishop Pierre de Mimet (1169-80)\r\nmoved the ancient tombs into the basilica. During some modern repairs\r\nparchments were discovered in a scaffold hole thirty feet from the\r\nground and closed only by a loose stone. The MSS. were in the Romance\r\ndialect of the XII century, and were abusive of Henry II of England, who\r\nbesieged Périgueux in Bishop de Mimet's time. Such a hiding place for\r\ncompromising papers might well have been thought of during the last\r\nstage of a building while yet the scaffolding stood in place.\r\n\r\nSt. Front's interior possesses a fine, plain solidity of its own, but\r\nits garish white walls cry out for mosaics or fresco. The cupolas rise\r\nabove the big arcades without any vertical foundation members. Each is\r\ndivided into a hemispherical dome and a drum having the shape of\r\nspherical triangles. So massive are the square piers supporting the\r\ncupolas that narrow corridors have been threaded through them. Those\r\ndense piles of masonry saved St. Front when the Huguenots lighted\r\nbonfires at the base of the piers. St. Étienne, formerly the cathedral\r\nof Périgueux, was devastated then, so that only two of its cupolas\r\nremain; the westernmost one is rougher, earlier work.\r\n\r\nThe restorer, Abadie, took deplorable liberties with St. Front, but it\r\nis an exaggeration to call it a modern church studied from a Romanesque\r\noriginal. Abadie from 1865 to 1875 reconstructed the great broad arches\r\nhitherto slightly pointed, and the actual sanctuary is entirely his\r\nwork. Oriental and un-French as is the exterior of Périgueux Cathedral\r\nwith its white domes, its neo-minarets, its immense tower each of whose\r\nstories is lesser in size than the one below it, and whose summit is a\r\npavilion covered with the inverted tiles called pineapple scales, one\r\nhas to accept the disconcerting fact that it was building in the same\r\nyear with the cathedrals at Paris and Laon. Well has St. Front been\r\ncalled an archæological monster defying the laws of that science.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF ANGOULÊME.[178]\r\n\r\n     If we wish to know all that is worthy of being imitated, we must\r\n     make of legends a part of our studies and observations. The marvel\r\n     of the lives of the saints is not their miracles, but their\r\n     conduct.--JOUBERT, _Pensées_ (1754-1824; born in Périgord).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Angoulême Cathedral. A XII-century Cupola Church of\r\nAquitaine with a Typical Façade of Poitou's Romanesque School_]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Angoulême shares with St. Front and Fontevrault the\r\ndistinction of being the finest cupola church in France. It is\r\nunsurpassed in the setting on the edge of the city's steep hill above\r\nthe Charente valley. In ancient Angoumois, now the department of the\r\nCharente, are over five hundred XII-century Romanesque churches.[179]\r\n\r\nAngoulême Cathedral was begun in 1109 by Bishop Gérard (1101-36), who\r\nhad taught at Périgueux in the cathedral school and no doubt learned\r\nthere to admire cupolas. His first dome at Angoulême--the easternmost\r\none--is slightly later than the older cupola of St. Étienne at\r\nPérigueux. Bishop Gérard had the moral courage to rebuke the sinful\r\nunion of the troubadour-duke, Guillaume IX, and the fair Vicomtesse\r\nMalbergeon, whose portrait he wore on his shield when he marched into\r\nbattle. Guillaume informed Gérard that only when hair grew on his bald,\r\nprelate pate would he give up the lady of his affections. Gérard was\r\npapal legate in Gaul for Pascal II, Calixtus II, and the second\r\nHonorius, and was the prelate chosen, because of his eloquence, to be\r\nspokesman for the bishops who opposed Paschal II's compromise with the\r\nGerman emperor on the question of investitures. And yet this able man,\r\nbecause Innocent II had not renewed his dignities, joined the anti-pope\r\nfaction and took with him Guillaume X of Aquitaine. Only the passionate\r\ngenius of St. Bernard was able to end the scandal.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral built at Angoulême by Bishop Gérard, like most of the\r\nchurches of the southwest, lacks the charm of perspective, since it has\r\nneither curving processional path nor side aisle. A note of force is\r\ngiven to the interior by the strong projection of the buttress piers,\r\nmore salient within the church than without. Farther to the south, when\r\nthe Gothic day had dawned, buttresses were to be disguised as walls\r\nbetween the side chapels. The three cupolas that roof the nave--each\r\ncovering a large square bay--are among the largest in France. The side\r\nwalls are divided at mid-height: below is a huge blind arch, while above\r\nare two round-headed windows. Angoulême's hemispherical domes on\r\npendentives were sufficiently well constructed to dispense with plaster\r\ncoatings, an advance over Cahors Cathedral and St. Étienne at Périgueux.\r\n\r\nAt the transept-crossing is an immense dome forming within the church a\r\nlantern lighted by a series of round-headed windows that open in its\r\npedestal. The arrangement derives directly from the Orient and is rare\r\nin France. A very fine tower, whose stories lessen as they rise, covers\r\nthe northern arm of the transept, and till the cathedral was sacked,\r\nduring the XVI-century wars, a similar tower spanned the transept's\r\nsouthern limb.\r\n\r\nAngoulême's elaborate XII-century façade is one of the noted pages of\r\nmonumental decoration in France, a frontal more of ornate beauty than of\r\npower, in which M. André Michel finds the influence of old ivories. Tier\r\non tier rise its carven scenes, with a Christ in Majesty crowning the\r\nwhole. The XIX-century restorer, M. Paul Abadie, who worked such havoc\r\nat Périgueux, took equal liberties here. He made the upper story with\r\nits turrets topped by conical spires, and over-restored the principal\r\nsculptural groups. These pre-Gothic churches of southwest France\r\nobsessed his imagination, for when he came to design a church of his own\r\nhe put up on the Mount of Martyrs in Paris a neo-Byzantine, neo-Gothic\r\nbasilica most strangely reminiscent of Aquitaine as it stands in exotic\r\nisolation under the cold, northern sky.\r\n\r\nAngoulême's west façade had not long been completed when under its\r\nportal passed John Lackland to be married to the fourteen-year-old\r\ndaughter of the Count of Angoulême, Isabella, already affianced to a\r\nLusignan. Henry III of England, the builder of Westminster Abbey, was\r\nthe fruit of that union. Twenty years later Isabella married the son of\r\nher discarded fiancé, and her jealousy filled France with war. Jezebel,\r\nthe people called her. She rests in effigy at Fontevrault, beside the\r\ntomb of her great father-in-law, Henry II, the first Plantagenet.\r\n\r\n\r\nFONTEVRAULT ABBEY CHURCH.[181]\r\n\r\n     A trait peculiar to this epoch is the close resemblance between the\r\n     manners of men and women.... Men had the right to dissolve in\r\n     tears, and women that of talking without prudery. The women appear\r\n     distinctly superior. They were more serious, more subtle. Richard\r\n     Coeur-de-Lion, the crowned poet-artist, a king whose noble\r\n     manners and refined mind, in spite of his cruelty, exercised so\r\n     strong an impression on his age, was formed by the brilliant\r\n     Aliénor of Aquitaine. St. Louis was brought up exclusively by\r\n     Blanche of Castile, and Joinville was the pupil of a widowed and\r\n     regent mother.--GAREAU, _Social State of France During the\r\n     Crusades_.\r\n\r\nThe art of the cupola church may be said to have culminated in the\r\nabbatial at Fontevrault on the confines of Anjou, Poitou, and Touraine,\r\nand practically the northernmost point to which attained the cupola\r\ndevelopment of Aquitaine. Undoubtedly it would have spread farther\r\nafield had it not been checked--even while Fontevrault was building--by\r\nthe advent of ogival ribs which initiated a new manner of masonry\r\nroofing. In Fontevrault's bourg is a village church covered gracefully\r\nin the Plantagenet Gothic manner.\r\n\r\nThe untenable theory was advanced by a French architect that the cupola\r\nchurch was the egg out of which hatched the radical organ of Gothic\r\narchitecture, that the first ribs were employed to stiffen a dome.[182]\r\nNo one to-day concedes this. Yet, though cupola monuments may not have\r\naffected French Gothic in general, they certainly exerted a local\r\ninfluence on the Gothic of the West. The hemispherical domes at\r\nFontevrault were directly under the eye of the first architects of\r\nPlantagenet Gothic.\r\n\r\nAn abbess ruled over men at Fontevrault. Its founder, the Blessed Robert\r\nd'Arbrissel, had been impressed by the Saviour giving St. John into the\r\nspiritual guidance of the Virgin. So he organized a new Order comprised\r\nof four communities ruled by a woman: a main house for nuns and another\r\nfor men; a hospital dedicated to St. Lazarus, and a house for repentant\r\nMagdalenes. Robert d'Arbrissel was a Breton, schooled in Paris, and\r\nnoted for his eloquence, which so impressed Urban II, who heard him\r\npreach at the dedication of Angers' church of St. Nicolas, that he named\r\nhim an apostolic missionary to spread the First Crusade.\r\n\r\nFeeling need of spiritual renewal, Robert had retired for meditative\r\npeace to these forests when one day he was attacked by bandits. He\r\nyielded all he possessed on condition that they give him their souls to\r\nguide, and, having converted them, the name of their chief, Evrault, was\r\ngiven, it is said, to the congregation that gathered in cells about the\r\nholy man. Pious folk came and sinners, the rich and the poor, the halt\r\nand the hale, and the impetuous Robert called them one and all \"the poor\r\nof Christ.\" \"I never read of a hermit,\" said honest old Samuel Johnson,\r\n\"but in imagination I kiss his feet; never of a monastery but I fall on\r\nmy knees and kiss the pavement.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1106, Paschal II approved the Order and in Blessed Robert's lifetime\r\nsome five thousand gathered at Fontevrault. Abbot Suger, who was a young\r\nstudent at that time near the new abbey, testified to the edification it\r\ngave. A sermon by the Blessed Robert converted the fair Bertrada de\r\nMontfort, who had quitted her ignoble husband, Fulk IV of Anjou, to\r\nmarry Philip I, king of France, which illegal union kept churchmen busy\r\nduring sixteen years; she callously brought her second master to visit\r\nher first. The fight which Rome waged to preserve monogamy in western\r\nChristendom deserves the highest praise. Bertrada died the second abbess\r\nof Fontevrault. The historic names of France compose the list of\r\nabbesses. The young widow of the only son of Henry I of England retired\r\nhere, after the loss of the White Ship, and her father, Fulk V of Anjou,\r\ncame to visit her as he quitted his career in Europe to take up his new\r\nrole as king of Jerusalem. Margaret of Burgundy, the builder of\r\nTonnerre's hospital hall, and second wife of Charles d'Anjou, St. Louis'\r\nbrother, was educated at Fontevrault by her aunt the abbess. About 1500\r\nAbbess Renée de Bourbon built the Renaissance cloister. To-day the\r\nfamous house serves as a state prison.\r\n\r\nFontevrault church played a part in the Gothic story. Its earliest\r\ncupola, over the transept-crossing, differs from those over the nave in\r\nthat its base is not distinct from its dome. Angers copied it in its\r\nchurches of St. Nicholas and St. Martin, and so did Saumur in St.\r\nPierre. When in 1119 Calixtus II dedicated Fontevrault, the church\r\nconsisted of the present choir and the transept. During the first\r\nquarter of the XII century the aisleless nave was spanned by four\r\ncupolas on clearly defined pedestals. Perhaps from Angoulême Cathedral\r\ncame the fashion of domes on pendentives, after some Fontevrault monks\r\nhad gone on legal business, in 1117, to the capital of Angoumois.\r\n\r\nThe _abbaye-double_ was favored both by the Angevin rulers and their\r\nPoitevin neighbors, the dukes of Aquitaine. Henry II's father and\r\nmother, Geoffrey the Handsome of Anjou and the ex-empress Matilda of\r\nEngland, gave generously toward the building of the new church, and so\r\ndid Aliénor of Aquitaine's forbears of the illustrious house of\r\nPoitiers; hence it was fitting they both, Henry and Aliénor, should lie\r\nin burial there. When Henry Plantagenet died in 1189 in his castle at\r\nChinon, which the old chronicler tells us rises steeply from the Vienne\r\n\"straight up to heaven\"--the Chinon whither Jeanne d'Arc was to come to\r\ngive France a new soul--the dead monarch was carried to Fontevrault\r\nchurch near by, instead of to the Grammont he favored, the mother-house\r\nof a new Order founded by Stephen de Tierney in 1176. The archbishop of\r\nTours came to Fontevrault to conduct the funeral, and Henry's rebellious\r\nson, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, stood by while they lowered into the tomb\r\nthe great administrator who gave us the germs of our jury system, the\r\nman of the same unbridled passions, the same strong leadership in arms\r\nand statecraft, as his ancestor, Fulk Nerra, who had won this strip of\r\nmiddle France by sheer ability. And well Richard might feel serious, for\r\nthe nine generations of increasing prosperity, promised to Fulk I of\r\nAnjou, ended with him.\r\n\r\nIn 1199 the Lion-hearted himself was brought to Fontevrault for burial;\r\nhe had begged to be laid in penitence at the feet of the father he had\r\ndefied, like the true Angevin he was. As his elder brother had said: \"It\r\nhas ever been the way with Plantagenets for brother to hate brother, and\r\nfor son to turn against father.\" The ceremony for Richard in Fontevrault\r\nabbey church was conducted by St. Hugh from Lincoln, where he was\r\nraising a splendid Early-English cathedral. He had come to France to\r\nprotest to Richard against further spoliation of his see. At this\r\n'shrouding of a second Angevin among the shrouden women,' Aliénor stood\r\nbeside the nuns, and, the ceremony over, St. Hugh, so wise and holy amid\r\nsuch seething passions, proceeded to comfort the widowed Berengaria.\r\n\r\nRichard, like his father, was a cosmopolite. \"_Miey hom e miey baron_,\r\n_Angles_, _Norman_, _Peytavin et Gascon_,\" he sang in his prison lay,\r\nand indeed one would be puzzled to know which of them were the\r\ncountrymen of him whom Guizot called \"the bravest, most inconsiderate,\r\nmost passionate, most ruffianly, most heroic adventurer of the Middle\r\nAges.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1204 his equally turbulent, able, and seductive mother, Aliénor, was\r\nburied at Fontevrault beside the husband against whom she had stirred up\r\nundutiful sons, and who in his last years had kept her shut away from\r\nfurther mischief. From 1122 to 1204 stretched her full life; queen of\r\nFrance for fifteen years, queen of England for fifty, a pernicious\r\ninfluence upon them both, but always a most sensible ruler for her own\r\nAquitaine. She passed her final years in peaceful Fontevrault, but her\r\nstormy destiny was to be troubled to the end. In 1204 her grandson,\r\nArthur of Brittany, besieged her in a Midi castle where she was\r\nvisiting, and when John Lackland heard of his mother's plight he came by\r\nforced marches to her relief and captured Arthur, who soon after was\r\nfoully murdered. Aliénor had seen the rise of Gothic at St. Denis, whose\r\ncorner stone her French husband laid, and she lived to found churches of\r\nthe gracious Plantagenet phase of the new art. But true daughter of the\r\nMidi that she was, an Aquitaine cupola church is her rightful funeral\r\nmonument. In her, as in her own Midi of that age, culture and corruption\r\nwere precocious.\r\n\r\nThe fourth of the famous Plantagenet tombs at Fontevrault which England\r\nhas tried to get for Westminster Abbey, is that of Isabelle of Angoulême\r\n(d. 1247), the wife of John Lackland. And there once were two others,\r\nthe tomb of Richard Coeur-de-Lion's favorite sister, Jeanne (d. 1199),\r\nwho became the fourth wife of Raymond VI of Toulouse, and that of her\r\nson, Count Raymond VII (d. 1249), of the Albigensian wars--tombs swept\r\naway either by the Huguenots or during the Revolution. As the XIX\r\ncentury opened, the Plantagenet tombs lay forgotten in a cellar. When\r\nEngland became aware of their value they were shipped to Paris in 1846,\r\nto be taken across the Channel. Luckily, however, an Angevin, M. de\r\nFalloux, became minister on the declaration of the Second Republic, and\r\nthe four precious mausoleums were returned to Fontevrault church.\r\n\r\nAliénor was ninth in descent from that Duke of Aquitaine who had founded\r\ngreat Cluny itself. Her grandfather, Guillaume IX, the troubadour duke,\r\nwas a benefactor of the newly established Fontevrault. When her father\r\nresigned his dominion in penitence, his will was that Aliénor, his\r\nheiress, should wed the son of the king of France. So in Bordeaux\r\nCathedral, in 1137, Aliénor married the future Louis VII. No\r\ntemperaments could have been more opposite. In 1249 she took the\r\nCrusader's cross from St. Bernard, at Vézelay--where the monks were\r\nbuilding their glorious basilica. At Constantinople her troublous beauty\r\nroused admiration, and scandal at Antioch, where the ruler was her own\r\nhandsome young uncle, Raymond of Poitiers.[183] Her union with Louis\r\nbecame an irksome bond and she clamored for its dissolution on the\r\nground of consanguinity. The flouted French king was only too happy to\r\nbe rid of her, but Abbot Suger, foreseeing all too clearly the national\r\ncalamity that would be precipitated should Aliénor's great domains pass\r\nto a rival of France, held together the mismatched pair. When he died,\r\nin 1152, headstrong Aliénor broke loose, and as she rode away from the\r\ncourt of France the great lords came out to woo her--one of them even\r\ntried to kidnap her. Because she craved a strong arm to revenge herself\r\non her first husband, she chose as consort young Henry Plantagenet,\r\nCount of Anjou and Maine, and Duke of Normandy; she was thirty, Henry\r\nnot yet twenty. Thus began the long Capet-Angevin duel, not to be fought\r\nout to a finish until 1452, when all that Henry II had possessed on the\r\nContinent and all of Aliénor's wide domain were in the hands of the king\r\nof France. It needed a St. Jeanne to atone for the very unsaintly\r\nAliénor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Plantagenet Tombs at Fontevrault_]\r\n\r\nFrom this unscrupulous, mischief-making, virile, and capable queen of\r\nthe XII century sprang a vigorous brood of men and women, passionate in\r\nboth good and evil, and most of them enlightened art patrons, builders\r\nof churches, and writers of verses. Coeur-de-Lion was a troubadour.\r\nJohn Lackland's son built Westminster Abbey. Aliénor's daughter, the\r\nqueen of Castile, had an Angevin architect help in the building of Las\r\nHuelgas, by Burgos. Her daughter of Champagne set the trouvères singing\r\nof Lancelot, Tristan, and Iseult. Another Eleanor of her lineage had her\r\nfuneral journey marked by sculptured crosses from Lincolnshire to\r\nCharing Cross. It was given Aliénor to make some atonement for the evil\r\nshe brought on France in her youth; at eighty years of age she went into\r\nSpain to bring back her granddaughter, Blanche of Castile, as bride for\r\nthe grandson of the discarded Louis VII, and Blanche gave France the\r\nsaint-king who illuminated his realm with fair churches. Another of\r\nAliénor's great-grandsons was a saint-king, Ferdinand, the conqueror of\r\nSeville, who founded many a church. Even as the cruelty and craft of\r\nJohn Lackland cropped out in Charles d'Anjou, whom the Sicilian Vespers\r\npunished, so the culture and inconsistency of Coeur-de-Lion appeared\r\nagain in his nephew of Champagne, Thibaut IV, the maker of songs. From\r\nAliénor descended Bishop Eudes de Sully, who built the western portals\r\nof Notre Dame at Paris, and Henry de Sully, who had the plans drawn for\r\nBourges Cathedral. Herself an outstanding figure in the early day of\r\nGothic art, and ancestress of enlightened builders, much can be forgiven\r\nAliénor. All of which brings us back to the starting point of our\r\nchapter, the formation of the Plantagenet Gothic school of architecture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTAGENET GOTHIC\r\n\r\n     The XII and XIII centuries were a period when men were at their\r\n     strongest; never before or since have they shown equal energy in\r\n     such varied directions or such intelligence in the direction of\r\n     their energy; yet these marvels of history--these Plantagenets;\r\n     these scholastic philosophers; these architects of Rheims and\r\n     Amiens; these Innocents and Robin Hoods and Marco Polos; these\r\n     crusaders who planted their enormous fortresses all over the\r\n     Levant; these monks who made the wastes and barrens yield\r\n     harvests--all, without apparent exception, bowed down before the\r\n     woman. The woman might be the good or the evil spirit, but she was\r\n     always the stronger force.--HENRY ADAMS.\r\n\r\nThere have been various divisions of this school, and it is always well\r\nto bear in mind that such cut-and-dried classifications are arbitrary\r\nand made use of merely for the greater ease of the student. By dividing\r\nPlantagenet work into three periods--preceded by a brief incubation\r\nhour, the twenty years before 1150--it is easier to follow the evolving\r\nsteps of this brilliant phase of the builder's art.\r\n\r\nDuring the short introductory stage before 1150 the cupola had the upper\r\nhand and imposed its construction on the intersecting ribs just imported\r\nfrom the north. The earliest _bombé_ vaults with ribs are really cupolas\r\nstill, since the stones of their infilling were laid in concentric rings\r\nround and round. Only a small number of these ribbed cupolas were built.\r\n\r\nThen in the first phase of Plantagenet Gothic appeared the ascendency of\r\nribbed vault over cupola. The dome was lowered and the stones of the\r\ninfilling were laid like those of a true Gothic vault, not horizontally,\r\nround and round, but vertically, with the courses running parallel with\r\nthe ridges of the triangular compartments traced by the diagonals. Each\r\nof the four triangular cells was concave in both directions, with a\r\ngroin defining its axial line. Hence eight panels, not four, composed\r\nthe _bombé_ vault, groin ridges alternating with ribs.\r\n\r\nSuch groin lines called for strengthening ribs beneath them, since a\r\ncurving surface has more need of a bone skeleton to stiffen it. Given\r\nthe _bombé_ shape, it was inevitable for the architect to arrive soon at\r\nthe use of ridge ribs between the diagonals. The Plantagenet vault _par\r\nexcellence_ is made up of eight ribs that branch from a central\r\nkeystone, those ribs being of the same slight graceful profile as the\r\narches framing each vault section.\r\n\r\nFor a time the rib molds of the First Period were enormously heavy and\r\nwide, like the diagonals of the nave of Angers Cathedral--the oldest\r\nAngevin Gothic work extant (c. 1150). Their profile shows two large\r\nround molds with a flat space between. Before long the level space\r\ntended to swell into a roll molding, which in time predominated over the\r\nlateral ones; such are the diagonals of the Trinité church at Angers\r\n(c. 1170). Finally, the side rolls died out altogether, leaving one\r\nslender uniform torus, a characteristic of the Second Period of\r\nPlantagenet art.\r\n\r\nWhen the lateral and transverse arches adopted the same delicate profile\r\nas that of the eight branching ribs, there was achieved the slender\r\nelegance and rare distinction typical of the best Plantagenet interiors.\r\nKeystones were richly carved, and pretty figures and heads were added\r\nwhere the vault ribs met the framing arches. During the last quarter of\r\nthe XII century the Plantagenet school was building vaults of this type,\r\nand they remained in vogue till the cuplike shape died out altogether.\r\nIn Plantagenet art the ramification and intercrossing of ribs had a\r\nstructural reason, since they were the logical result of the concave\r\noutline of the vault and not, like the supplementary ribs of Flamboyant\r\nGothic, mere ornamentations.\r\n\r\nIn the third and final period of Plantagenet Gothic, the ribs ramified\r\nmore and more. They had first been increased about the windows of apses,\r\nbecause an eight-branch vault was better suited to a square than to a\r\ncurve. During the years preceding 1250, the ramification of the ribs\r\ngrew very complicated. All divisions between the vault sections were\r\neliminated, and the masonry roof appeared to be continuous, one bay\r\nmelting subtly into the next--in reality a cradle vault, _à\r\npénétrations_, carried on intercrossing, branching Gothic ribs. The\r\nconstruction of such stone roofs was no easy matter and comparatively\r\nfew of them were built.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that a germ of the Angevin school when carried\r\nto England, then under the same Plantagenet rule, developed into what is\r\na unique architectural glory, English fan tracery vaulting.\r\n\r\nMost of the monuments of Angevin art fall under the three main divisions\r\nhere given. Like a beautiful hybrid, the Plantagenet stone roof passed\r\nthrough a continuous series of transformations, while in northern\r\nFrance, once a satisfactory masonry vault had been achieved, it was\r\nadhered to faithfully as a classic type until the Flamboyant, or final,\r\nphase.\r\n\r\nFrequently a Plantagenet church is extremely plain outside, in striking\r\ncontrast with the aërial grace of its interior. The cause is a\r\nstructural one, hence satisfactory. The thrust of a _bombé_ vault is not\r\naltogether concentrated on branching ribs, piers, and buttresses, but in\r\npart is borne by the inclosure walls. Hence these latter were made thick\r\nand pierced merely by lancet windows; with such walls there was no need\r\nof flying buttresses. When the piers were somewhat relieved of the roof\r\nload by the thick walls, they could be made exceedingly slender. There\r\nis an effect of gracious winsomeness in certain Plantagenet churches, to\r\nbe described only by such words as \"fairylike\" and \"Saracenic.\" The\r\ntransient perfect moment of the art of northern France was seized and\r\nrendered by the curving transept at Soissons, an ideal vision of the\r\nBeyond. In southwestern France the first, fine, careless rapture nothing\r\ncan recapture is to be found in St. Serge at Angers, of lesser genius\r\nthan Soissons, but, like it, possessed of an enthrallment that is\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF ANGERS.[184]\r\n\r\n     A mon avis, ceux qui n'ont pas au moins le tourment religieux\r\n     ignorent la moitié de la vie, et la plus belle, la moitié de la\r\n     pitié. Un esprit est bien incomplet s'il ne s'élève pas jusqu'à sa\r\n     destinée, et un coeur est bien faible s'il n'a que des motifs\r\n     humains d'agir, de se contraindre, et de se donner ou de\r\n     pardonner.--RENÉ BAZIN (born in Angers, 1850).\r\n\r\nNo city in southwestern France is a more satisfactory center for a\r\ncomparative study of Plantagenet Gothic than Angers--the old Black\r\nAngers of history, which owed its importance not to any pre-eminence of\r\nsite, but to the powerful line whose cradle land it was.\r\n\r\nEach phase of the regional school of Gothic can be found in Angers. In\r\nthe tower of St. Aubin, a vestige of an ancient abbey named after a\r\nVI-century bishop of the city, is a ribbed cupola, typical of the\r\nincubating period of the school.[185] It is more a cupola than a Gothic\r\nvault. The stones are laid horizontally in concentric rings, and the\r\nribs are more decorative than structural, being in part embedded in the\r\ninfilling. The abbot who erected it ruled from 1127 to 1154.\r\n\r\nThe First Period of the Gothic of Anjou is represented at Angers by a\r\nmasterpiece of elemental force--the nave of the cathedral. Three huge\r\nso-called domical vaults, truly Gothic in construction, span the\r\nsixty-foot unaisled nave of St. Maurice. The stones are laid parallel\r\nwith the groin line of each triangular panel between the intersecting\r\nribs. Those diagonals are needlessly heavy, for the builders were still\r\nexperimenting. The crown of each vault section is ten feet higher than\r\nthe framing arches--wall arch and transverse arch. The exceptional span\r\nof Angers' three massive vaults is due to a reconstruction of the nave\r\nundertaken in the XII century, at which time the side aisles of the\r\nRomanesque cathedral were eliminated and the entire width of the edifice\r\nthrown into an unobstructed hall.\r\n\r\nMr. John Bilson, the eminent English archæologist, belittles the\r\ninfluence of the cupola church in Angevin Gothic, the shape of whose\r\nvaults he attributes to a structural cause. He thinks that the extreme\r\nwidth of Angers' nave made it essential to raise the keystone above the\r\ncrowns of transverse and wall arches in order to prevent its settling.\r\nThe diagonals were made more obtuse than the equilateral framing arches\r\nlest they might tower too high. Given the form adopted for the arches,\r\nthe _bombé_ vault web resulted inevitably. Arch curves determine the\r\nforms of a vault. None the less is M. Berthelé's account of the\r\nPlantagenet school sound both ethnically and æsthetically. The Angevin\r\narchitect chose to persist in the use of _bombé_ vaults over narrow\r\nspans where there was no structural need to raise the keystone.\r\n\r\nA succession of cathedrals had stood on the site of Angers' actual\r\nchurch. To that of the IV century, St. Martin, Gaul's apostle, presented\r\nrelics of St. Maurice and his legion of Theban soldiers. A Merovingian\r\ncathedral mentioned by Gregory of Tours was succeeded by a Carolingian\r\nbasilica, and after the year 1000 the chief church of Angers was rebuilt\r\nseveral times as Romanesque. A dedication occurred in 1030. In 1032 the\r\ncathedral was wiped out by a fire caused by that remarkable personage,\r\nFulk Nerra, the Black Falcon, who raised Anjou from an insignificant\r\nunder-fief to be one of the chief powers in France.[186] To atone for\r\nhis feudal excesses, Fulk built many shrines and made many pilgrimages;\r\nin Palestine, with the same melodramatic instinct for the picturesque\r\nwhich his descendant, Coeur-de-Lion, was to display, he walked\r\nbarefooted in the streets of Jerusalem, flagellated by his own\r\nservitors, as he lamented, \"Lord be merciful to a perjured, unfaithful\r\nChristian wandering far from his native land.\"\r\n\r\nAll over Anjou, and in Touraine, Fulk III put up abbey churches and\r\ncastles; \"the great builder,\" he was called. One day, from his castle on\r\nthe rock of Angers, his falcon eyes saw a dove fluttering over a certain\r\nspot beyond the river, and there he founded the abbey of St. Nicholas in\r\n1020, and his wife at that period (he had a succession of wives, one of\r\nwhom he is said to have killed) founded a nunnery close by to which was\r\nonce attached the church of the Trinité. In the XVI century St. Nicholas\r\nwas called Ronceray, because a bramble-rose insisted on pushing its way\r\nup through the choir's pavement.[187] A superman was Fulk the Black,\r\nhighly dowered intellectually, with enormous capacity for organization,\r\nbut of shameless wickedness, calculating, subtle, unscrupulous as to the\r\nmeans by which he pursued his designs, and of demoniac temper--marked\r\ntraits in his race from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nVestiges of the cathedral of Angers which rose after the fire of 1032,\r\nand in which Urban II preached the First Crusade, are in the actual\r\nnave, built by Bishop Ulger[188] (1125-49). He taught in the cathedral\r\nschool, which school was the nucleus of the present University of\r\nAngers. His successor, Bishop Normand de Doué (1149-53), at his own\r\nexpense, substituted for the timber roof of the new nave its massive\r\nAngevin vaults. When we recall that only fifteen years earlier Abbot\r\nSuger, who started Gothic architecture on its triumphal career, was\r\nbuilding the heavy diagonals to be seen in the antechurch at St. Denis,\r\nwe can understand what pioneers were the builders of southwest France in\r\nthe use of the cardinal organ of the new system.\r\n\r\nAngers Cathedral continued building during the final years of the XII\r\ncentury, under Bishop Raoul de Beaumont (1177-97), who erected the\r\nsouthern arm of the transept and added a short choir; the city walls at\r\nthat period prevented the farther extension of the apse. Along the west\r\nfaçade, the same prelate built a spacious porch, twenty-five feet deep,\r\nwhich stood till 1806, when, in spite of episcopal protest, the civic\r\nauthorities tore it down rather than trouble to repair it. Sorely does\r\nthe western entrance need that softening portico. Angers' portal images\r\nare of the same archaic column-statue type as those at Chartres' western\r\ndoors, and here, too, in the tympanum is a Byzantine Christ in an\r\nelliptical aureole, surrounded by the symbols of the evangelists. Bishop\r\nRaoul de Beaumont came of one of the illustrious races of crusaders,\r\nstatesmen, and prelates, the _ancienne chevalerie_ in which France was\r\nso prolific for centuries. A XIII-century Beaumont, marshal of France,\r\nstood by Joinville in voting against the knight's return to Europe until\r\nthey had redeemed their servitors from captivity; a XIV-century Beaumont\r\nwas instrumental in giving Dauphiny to France; a Beaumont in the XVIII\r\ncentury was the archbishop of Paris, who warned the nation that if it\r\nde-Christianized itself it would be denationalized. Bishop Raoul's\r\nnephew, Guillaume de Beaumont, became bishop of Angers, and in 1236\r\ndonated land from his garden for the erection of the northern arm of\r\nthe transept. Eight-branch Plantagenet vault sections cover transept and\r\nchoir.\r\n\r\nThe choir of Angers Cathedral was extended after 1274, when permission\r\nwas obtained from St. Louis' brother, Charles d'Anjou, to demolish part\r\nof the city ramparts. Heavy buttresses mark the junction of the old part\r\nand the new. By the extension of the eastern limb the church became a\r\nbold Latin cross. Secluded nooks in dim religious corners are not to be\r\nfound in these unaisled churches of southwestern France. In them is no\r\ncurving procession path, no picturesque perspective effects. Though they\r\npossess their own quiet nobility, seldom does their grave reverence rise\r\nto sublimity. The exterior of Angers Cathedral was made equally simple,\r\nwithout radiating apse chapels or flying buttresses.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral's nave boasts some windows which were donated before 1180\r\nby a generous canon. Borders of the St. Denis glass were repeated in\r\nthem. The third window (north), which has an inimitable deep blue\r\nbackground and a wide border, relates St. Catherine's life; the fourth\r\nportrays, the Burial of the Virgin; and the fifth is devoted to St.\r\nVincent. Probably local workers allied with the St. Denis school made\r\nthese lights. In the nave's southern wall is a good Renaissance lancet,\r\ntransferred here from a ruined château. When the choir was completed,\r\nits windows were filled with glass of the Paris school a century later\r\nthan the nave's windows. The transept roses are Flamboyant Gothic.\r\n\r\nAngers Cathedral tops a high hill, so that its towers are landmarks,\r\nvisible for thirty miles around. Its west façade has been so\r\nreconstructed that it now presents the ungainly proportions of the\r\nchurch fronts in Hanover and Brunswick. After a fire, in 1516, when the\r\ntowers were renewed, stone spires were added by the well-known\r\nFlamboyant Gothic master, Rouland Le Roux, who elaborated the\r\nfrontispiece of Rouen Cathedral. Then, in 1533, a third tower was built\r\nbetween the original two. One of its walls rested on the west façade,\r\nbut the other three have mere arches for foundations, so that the tower\r\nhangs in space, as it were, the kind of feat applauded by the tourist\r\nguide, but which the true lover of structural sincerity can dispense\r\nwith. Jean de l'Espine, a local master of whom Angers is proud, designed\r\nthe curious central tower, and two sculptors who had worked on groups at\r\nSolesmes made the façades eight warrior images which have been restored.\r\n\r\nScarcely was Angers Cathedral newly dressed when came the tragic year\r\n1562, to wreck the gathered treasures of generations. The Huguenots\r\nbroke into the transept from the bishop's garden--and ever since that\r\ndoor has been walled up in disgrace. For a fortnight they intrenched\r\nthemselves in the church, looting its treasures, destroying tombs and\r\nimages. More than a hundred splendid tombs lined the walls of the\r\nchurch. The neo-classic canons of the XVII and XVIII centuries lost so\r\nentirely the comprehension of the national art that they sent priceless\r\nbronze tombs to the smelting pot, even that of Bishop Raoul de Beaumont,\r\nthe builder. A silver-gilt altar given by Bishop Normand de Doué who\r\nspanned the nave with its vaults of magnificent proportions, was sold,\r\nas was another altar, the gift of Bishop Guillaume de Beaumont, and with\r\nthe proceeds was erected the pseudo-classic baldaquin over the high\r\naltar. They did away with the lower panels of the precious XII-century\r\nwindows in order that a new metal balustrade might show to better\r\neffect. In a final attack of _bon goût_, those worthy canons proceeded\r\nto whitewash the entire inside of the cathedral, including the tombs and\r\nstatues. The Revolution broke up the elaborate funereal monument of good\r\nKing René, on which several generations had worked; Jacques Morel, who\r\nsculptured the Souvigny sarcophagus, was putting final touches to it\r\nwhen he died in Angers in 1453. For years after 1793 its chiseled stones\r\nwere used by the city's masons to adorn chimney pieces in civilians'\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nAnjou, after returning to the French crown in the XIV century, was again\r\ngiven as an appanage to a king's son, to Louis,[189] son of Jean le Bon,\r\nand brother of those art-loving Valois princes, Charles V and the Dukes\r\nof Berry and Burgundy. Louis I d'Anjou had made for his palace chapel at\r\nAngers, in 1378, some tapestries telling the Apocalypse wonders. His\r\ngrandson, good King René, presented them to the cathedral, where first\r\nthey were hung for a visit of Louis XI. In the days when the cathedral\r\nwalls were being whitewashed those one hundred and fifty yards of\r\ntextile art, made by Parisian weavers after Flemish models--and the\r\noldest-dated tapestries extant--were put up for sale, but, not finding a\r\npurchaser, were used to cover greenhouses and to line stables. When in\r\n1843 the bishop of Angers was able to rescue a hundred yards of the\r\nApocalypse, he was mocked for his taste for rubbish. Three hundred\r\nfrancs was all he paid for over sixty sections of the embroidery, and\r\nwhen one section was recently loaned to the exhibition at Ghent it was\r\ninsured for forty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nLouis II d'Anjou married Yolande of Aragon, a statesman-like woman of\r\nsound character and good taste, and together they built the pavilion\r\nthat stands within the fortress inclosure, and the chapel adjoining it\r\n(finished in 1411), whose _bombé_ vaults are carried on ribs of\r\nprismatic profile. Yolande's two sons, Charles and René, ruled Anjou.\r\nThe claims of Louis XI to the duchy caused his uncle, King René, to\r\nspend his latter years in Provence, but never did he forget his\r\nbirthplace, and to Angers Cathedral he sent the green marble Roman bath\r\nmounted on lions, now used as a holy-water font. René wrote poems and\r\nplays, composed church music, painted and illuminated, and throughout a\r\nlong life of misfortunes proved himself a loyal knight and Christian\r\nphilosopher. Shortly after his death Anjou returned to the French\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nThe ramparts within whose somber walls was the palace[190] of the counts\r\nand dukes of Anjou's three lines of rulers, was constructed by St.\r\nLouis, from 1228 to 1238, though begun by his grandfather,\r\nPhilippe-Auguste. For the precincts of his huge fortress St. Louis was\r\ncompelled to take lands from the congregation of Toussaint. With the\r\ncompensation money the religious rebuilt their church and roofed it with\r\na Plantagenet Gothic vault of the elaborate final phase of the regional\r\nschool. The interlocking ribs had three lines of keystones, like the\r\nvault of Airvault (Deux-Sèvres).\r\n\r\nToussaint had been founded in the XI century by a pious canon, as a\r\nrefuge for the poor and stricken, and the duty of its clergy was to\r\nvisit the sick and bury the dead. That every forlorn soul might feel\r\nunder the protection of his own chosen patron saint, the name All Saints\r\nwas chosen. The Revolution suppressed the asylum of charity and in 1815\r\nPrussian cavalry were stabled in the neglected church. The roofless nave\r\nnow serves as an archæological museum. The vaults of the choir were made\r\nearly in the XVIII century on the same model as the nave's XIII-century\r\nPlantagenet roof.\r\n\r\nThe fortress built by St. Louis on the Toussaint property was saved from\r\ndemolition by the seneschal of Anjou, who, when Henry III's orders came\r\nto destroy the ramparts, had the tact to proceed in so leisurely a\r\nfashion that after seven years, when he was able to get the order\r\nrevoked, little more was destroyed than the upper stories of the towers.\r\nA kneeling image of that truly patriotic seneschal, Donadieu de\r\nPuycharic, is now in the museum installed in the XII-century hospital of\r\nSt. Jean.\r\n\r\nThat hospital of St. Jean was begun by another enlightened seneschal of\r\nAnjou, but before long (c. 1180) Henry Plantagenet undertook to finish\r\nand endow it, some say to expiate the assassination of St. Thomas\r\nBecket. The oldest parts of St. John's establishment are the granary and\r\nthe north and east corridors of the cloister; the latter's south gallery\r\nwas built (1538) by Angers' local architect, Jean de l'Espine. The\r\nhospital hall was undertaken between 1174 and 1188, and at first was\r\nroofed in wood.\r\n\r\nShortly after 1200 the Knights of St. John Hospitalier of Jerusalem were\r\nput in charge of Angers hospital, and governed it till 1232. During\r\ntheir occupancy the hall was covered by its twenty-four small cuplike\r\nsections, each of which is carried on four slender ribs. The effect of\r\nthe three aisles of little _bombé_ vaults is alluring. The slender torus\r\nusually distinguished the eight-branch Plantagenet type, and its use\r\nhere for simple diagonals is an exception. The chapel attached to the\r\nhospital was also built in two campaigns; over part of it was employed\r\nthe eight-rib vault, while portions were roofed in the more complicated\r\nPlantagenet way.\r\n\r\nThe singular grace of St. Jean's hospital hall, with its slender columns\r\nand multiple little _coupoliformes_ vaults, inspired the small choir of\r\nSt. Serge, which many hold to be the most exquisite example of\r\nPlantagenet Gothic. The church[191] once formed part of an ancient\r\nBenedictine monastery named for the pope, who had instituted the triple\r\nchanting of the _Agnus Dei_ in the Mass. Hitherto the Angevin masonry\r\nroof had been applied to churches without side aisles. The ground plan\r\nof the cupola church had been adhered to. The Plantagenet architects now\r\nbegan to copy another regional model, Poitou's Romanesque church, whose\r\nside aisles were almost as high as the principal span they buttressed;\r\nhence the light came entirely from the lateral corridors. One roof\r\ncovered all.\r\n\r\nPoitiers Cathedral was among the first to use Poitou's pre-Gothic plan\r\nin Plantagenet architecture. The choir of St. Serge developed the same\r\nidea in its own small, gracious way. No doubt the harmonious effect\r\nobtained in St. John's hospital by the three aisles of _bombé_ vaults\r\ninspired the architect of St. Serge, who built his choir, from 1220 to\r\n1225. Six fragile-looking columns, thirty feet in height, support with\r\nease the twelve little Plantagenet vaults, which are of the eight-branch\r\ntype, with elaborate keystones, and minute figures at the intersection\r\nof the ribs and the framing arches. At the choir's square eastern end\r\nthe ribs ramify considerably around the windows. It is impossible to say\r\nwherein lies the witchery of this small monument--all elegance and\r\nlightness. Some call it Saracenic because of its exotic loveliness. Its\r\nscience of construction is perfect. Certainly some individual genius\r\ndesigned it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUMUR[192]\r\n\r\n     L'ancienne Grand' Rue de Saumur ... la rue montueuse qui mène au\r\n     château, obscure en quelques endroits, remarquable par la sonorité\r\n     de son petit pavé caillouteux, toujours propre et sec ... la paix\r\n     de ses maisons impénétrables, noirs, et silencieuses--l'histoire de\r\n     France est là, tout entière.--BALZAC, _Eugénie Grandet_ (whose\r\n     scene is Saumur).\r\n\r\nClose by Angers lies Saumur on the Loire, \"well-loved, well-set city.\"\r\nIt comprises, with its environs, another center for the study of\r\nPlantagenet Gothic. The town is topped by its castle, now in main part\r\nof the XIV century. In its former great hall, built by Henry\r\nPlantagenet, took place, in 1241, that celebrated fête called the\r\n_Non-Pareille_ which Joinville has described. His memory of it was so\r\nfresh, after sixty years, that he could tell the color of Louis IX's\r\nrobe and surcoat; perhaps it was the first time that Joinville saw the\r\nsaint-king who was to become his closest friend. He was not yet twenty\r\nwhen he accompanied his suzerain of Champagne, Thibaut IV, the maker of\r\nsongs, to the feast held in Saumur château for the knighting of Alphonse\r\nof Poitiers, the king's brother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Plantagenet Gothic Choir of St. Serge at Angers\r\n(1220-1225)_]\r\n\r\nThe bodyguard of St. Louis were a Bourbon, a Coucy, and a Beaujeu,\r\nbehind whom stood ranged a host of barons and knights in silk and cloth\r\nof gold. The future king of Portugal and a prince from Thuringia, the\r\nson of St. Elizabeth of Hungary, waited on the table of the\r\nqueen-mother, Blanche of Castile, who, when she heard the name of the\r\nprinceling from beyond the Rhine, called him to her side and placed a\r\nkiss upon his brow, since there, she said, his saintly mother must often\r\nhave blessed him. Jealous passions, too, burned behind the glitter and\r\nshow. Isabelle of Angoulême, the widow of John Lackland, married now to\r\na Lusignan who had to render homage to his new suzerain, cried out,\r\nimperiously, \"Am I a waiting woman that I should stand while they sit at\r\nease?\" and she proceeded to stir up war.\r\n\r\nBelow the castle of Saumur lies the XII-century unaisled church of St.\r\nPierre, whose masonry roof belongs to different phases of Angevin\r\nGothic. Over the transept-crossing is a ribbed cupola without distinct\r\npedestal, inspired evidently by the small unribbed cupola of\r\nFontevrault's crossing. The stones are laid in horizontal concentric\r\ncourses like a true dome. Though archaic in structure, St. Pierre's\r\n_croisée_ is of skilled execution. It belongs to the last third of the\r\nXII century.\r\n\r\nOver the choir and transept are the heavy diagonals of the First Period\r\nof the Plantagenet development, and the nave's vault sections are\r\ncarried on the eight branches of the Second Period. Powerful transverse\r\narches separate the wide, square bays, and against the inclosure walls\r\nare other strong arches beneath the windows. The walls of St. Pierre's\r\nchoir are not parallel, but draw closer together at the eastern end, for\r\nundoubtedly there was much intentional asymmetry in mediæval monuments.\r\nThe Flamboyant day gave to St. Pierre its well-carved choir stalls and\r\nsome exquisitely toned Flemish tapestries executed by local weavers.\r\n\r\nOther superb tapestries adorn Notre Dame-de-Nantilly, a church\r\npatronized by Louis XI, who added to it the south aisle and a Flamboyant\r\noratory. The body of the edifice belongs to the first half of the XII\r\ncentury; its barrel vault is braced by slightly pointed transverse\r\narches. At the transept-crossing is a ribbed cupola, without distinct\r\npedestal, like that of St. Pierre. Against the fourth pier, to the\r\nsouth, is the epitaph which good King René himself composed and set up\r\nbecause of his affection for his old nurse, Dame Tiphaine, for whose\r\nsoul he begs a paternoster of all who pass by. Against the fifth pier is\r\nthe Limousin enamel crozier of the archbishop of Tyr, keeper of the seal\r\nfor St. Louis, who was buried here in his native city in 1266.\r\n\r\nBehind the Gothic Town Hall is the now unused chapel of St. Jean, a\r\nsmall example of the Third Period of Angevin architecture, when ribs\r\nbranched considerably; in the square chevet they ramify to the number of\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nA mile down the river lies what is left of St. Florent-les-Saumur[193]\r\nre-established by Fulk Nerra when he conquered Saumur in 1026. Its\r\nnarthex, now the chapel of a nuns' community, shows one of the earliest\r\nuses of the Plantagenet vault of eight branches (1170-1200). At St.\r\nFlorent was living the daughter of the exiled poet-duke of Orléans, with\r\nher young husband, the Duke of Alençon, when one day in 1429 word came\r\nthat at Chinon, near by, where Charles VII was staying, had arrived an\r\ninspired maid, and young d'Alençon, soon to be Jeanne d'Arc's\r\nlieutenant--her _gentil duc_--galloped along the banks of the Loire to\r\nsee the wonder. So delighted was he with Jeanne's management of spear\r\nand horse that he presented her with a palfrey, and she came to St.\r\nFlorent-les-Saumur for a four days' visit to his duchess, promising[194]\r\nthat anxious young wife that she would bring back her husband safe and\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nFontevrault's abbatial, where culminated the art of the cupola church,\r\nis the chief excursion to be made from Saumur. It can be reached by a\r\nten-mile trolley ride. Only three miles from Fontevrault, and a pleasant\r\ncross-country walk from it, is the beautiful Plantagenet Gothic church\r\nof St. Martin, at Candes,[195] crowned with battlements, on the highland\r\nabove the confluence of the Vienne and the Loire. In the ancient abbey\r\nhere St. Martin died as the IV century closed. A chapel to the north of\r\nthe choir marks the site of his cell, and its window recalls the pious\r\npiracy of his loyal parishioners of Tours, who claimed his body for\r\nburial, but who, knowing that Candes would not give it up, came by night\r\nand stole it away; and quite rightly they had judged, for when,\r\ncenturies later, the Northmen invasions forced Tours to send its great\r\nrelic for safe-keeping to Auxerre, it took an army of six thousand men\r\nto get it back.\r\n\r\nThe present choir of St. Martin's at Candes was built in the latter half\r\nof the XII century (c. 1180). Fifty years later rose the nave, justly\r\nconsidered one of the most brilliant examples of Plantagenet Gothic\r\narchitecture, its model, not the unaisled cupola-church, but the\r\nRomanesque church of Poitou, whose side aisles are so high that their\r\nlancets are the only lighting of the edifice. St. Martin's hall-like\r\ninterior of three spacious aisles is inundated with light. The\r\nwell-proportioned clustered piers rising from pavement to\r\nvault-springing are placed considerably out of alignment, and in a\r\nnumber of other arrangements the architect here followed his personal\r\nbent. In the western porch the ribs of several Plantagenet vault\r\nsections fall on a central pillar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL AT POITIERS[196]\r\n\r\n  _Vexilla Regis prodeunt_\r\n  _Fulget Crucis mysterium_\r\n  _Qua vita mortem pertulit_\r\n  _Et morte vitam protulit._\r\n\r\n  Abroad the regal banners fly\r\n  And bear the mystic Cross on high,\r\n  That Cross whereon Life suffered Death\r\n  And gave us Life with Dying breath.\r\n\r\n  _Impleta sunt quæ concinit_\r\n  _David fideli carmine,_\r\n  _Dicendo nationibus_\r\n  _Regnavit a ligno Deus._\r\n\r\n  That which the prophet-king of old\r\n  Hath in mysterious verse foretold\r\n  Is now accomplished whilst we see\r\n  God ruling nations from a Tree.\r\n\r\n  --FORTUNATUS, bishop of Poitiers (599-607).[197]\r\n\r\nThe noblest Gothic monument due to Henry Plantagenet and Aliénor of\r\nAquitaine is the cathedral church at Poitiers, founded by them in 1162\r\nabout the same time that, in Paris, Louis VII witnessed the laying of\r\nthe corner stone for a new chief church in his capital. Never were\r\ncontemporary edifices more unlike in their form and their informing\r\nspirit. In Notre Dame of Paris breathes the struggle of human existence\r\nand that Christian resignation voiced by the XIII-century Franciscan in\r\nthe _Dies Iræ_. St. Peter's Cathedral at Poitiers rings with Christian\r\njoy, with the triumphal strains of the hymn composed by its VI-century\r\nbishop for the arrival from Constantinople of the True Cross relic. From\r\nthe hour that the ancient ecclesiastical city marched forth with banners\r\nflying to meet the Cross, Poitiers has held it to be a tree of royal\r\nhonor, not of pathetic agony. Her greatest bishop, St. Hilary, was\r\nwestern Christendom's champion for the Son's divinity when the Arian\r\nheresy attacked it. Clovis defeated the Arian Visigoths at Poitiers in\r\n508; Charles Martel checked the Mohammedans at Poitiers in 732.\r\n\r\nA city's spiritual history speaks by its monuments. In the high place of\r\nhonor in Poitiers' cathedral of St. Peter, hangs a gleaming canticle of\r\ntranslucent mosaic, a window which many hold to be the finest in the\r\nworld. It celebrates God ruling nations from a tree. It is a passion and\r\na triumph, an agony and an apotheosis. Eight centuries divide the\r\ninspiration of the Crucifixion window from St. Hilary's struggle with\r\nArianism, six centuries from the canticle of Bishop Venantius\r\nFortunatus, but Hilary's affirmation and the rejoicing of Fortunatus\r\nlive in it, and through it have been passed on to us.\r\n\r\nPoitiers Cathedral is a spacious hall-church illuminated by large\r\nlancets that seem to be chanting Alleluias, yet whose piety is plain and\r\nrobust. It is a church loyal to indigenous art traditions, yet blending\r\nthose sober Romanesque inheritances of Poitou with the delicate grace of\r\nPlantagenet Gothic. Its loveliness is severe, its slenderness is sturdy.\r\nSt. Peter's both imposes and allures.\r\n\r\nPoitiers was the cradle of Aliénor of Aquitaine's brilliant and\r\ndebonaire line of troubadours, crusaders, and church builders.\r\nCharlemagne gave them the title of Duke of Aquitaine for their services\r\nagainst Islam. The first warrior duke died a hermit at St.\r\nGuilhem-le-Désert, which became a Midi pilgrim shrine where, in the\r\nGothic dawn, appeared a very early use of diagonals, profiled like those\r\nof the Ile-de-France. A duke of Aquitaine founded Cluny, the greatest\r\nbuilding energy of the ages. Another of the dynasty of the Guillaumes\r\naided Bishop Fulbert to build Chartres, and, when fire wiped out\r\nPoitiers Cathedral, reconstructed it in Romanesque form. Guillaume VIII\r\nand Guillaume IX built at Bordeaux the churches of Ste. Croix, St.\r\nSeurin, and St. André. In Poitiers they raised anew Notre Dame-la-Grande\r\nand St. Hilaire, and founded Montierneuf,[198] blessed by Urban II in\r\n1096. Aliénor's grandfather, Guillaume IX, the first-known troubadour,\r\nespecially favored Fontevrault. Her father was that Guillaume X, with\r\nthe appetites of eight men, an open boaster of his crimes, whom it took\r\nSt. Bernard to beat to his knees in penitence, after which he passed out\r\nof history in the odor of sanctity as pilgrim to Compostela.\r\n\r\nWith the art of the builder Aliénor's own links were multiple. When\r\nBishop Geoffrey de Lèves took charge of her as a young bride in\r\nBordeaux, he was raising at Chartres the most beautiful tower in the\r\nworld. She assisted at St. Denis' dedication and knew Abbot Suger well;\r\nat Vézelay she watched the Burgundians sculpting a portal of paradise.\r\nThrough all her crowded life, with all her reckless sins upon her,\r\nAliénor was loyal to her own region. She began Poitiers Cathedral in the\r\nsame decade that she had her favorite son Richard the Lion-hearted\r\ninstalled as ruler of Aquitaine--another troubadour duke--seating him in\r\nthe abbot's chair at St. Hilaire's, according to ancient custom. She\r\nblended with her own Poitou's Romanesque what was choicest in the Gothic\r\nart of her Angevin husband.\r\n\r\nPoitiers Cathedral was the prototype of monuments such as Candes and\r\nPuy-Notre-Dame, in whose interiors Aliénor's own \"high grace, the dower\r\nof queens,\" seems incarnate. An Angevin architect probably designed St.\r\nPeter's at Poitiers. The works started at the east end, which is square,\r\nand rises from the down-slope of the hill like a solid fortress, a\r\nhundred and fifty feet in height; Coligny's troops were one day to\r\nriddle with bullets that big quadrangular target. So thick was the\r\neastern wall that the round chapels ending the choir disappeared in its\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nThe easternmost bays and the south arm of the transept were built about\r\nthe same time, soon after 1160, and their masonry roof belongs to the\r\nfirst phase of the Gothic of the West. Over the crossing is a six-branch\r\nvault; for the rest of the church, the eight-branch type was used. The\r\nlower half of the inclosure walls is ornamented with a blind arcade\r\nabove which runs a circulating gallery carried on corbels carved with\r\nfantasy. Again was used the artifice employed in Poitiers' Romanesque\r\nchurch of Notre Dame-la-Grande, whereby from the eastern end onward the\r\nedifice grew slightly wider and higher. The axial line deviates\r\nconsiderably, and it is known that this cathedral rose during different\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nWhile the plan and the beginning of the work were of Aliénor and Henry's\r\nday, the greater part of the church was erected under their\r\ngreat-grandson, Alphonse of Poitiers, the brother of St. Louis. When he\r\ndied in 1271, the two westernmost bays were incomplete. After a lull,\r\nthe work was resumed at the close of the century. In the XIV century was\r\nerected the not very interesting west frontispiece which stands below\r\nthe street level and which is too wide for its height; it would have\r\nbeen better had the towers been set in a line with the aisles and not\r\nplanted beyond them like the towers of Rouen and Bourges. The first of\r\nthe Avignon popes, Clement V, builder of the Rayonnant Gothic choir of\r\nBordeaux Cathedral, watched Poitiers' Rayonnant façade rising during the\r\nsixteen months that he spent in the city. While here he learned that\r\nfire had damaged St. John Lateran's at Rome and ordered it to be\r\nreconstructed. The last windows in St. Pierre's Cathedral have the\r\nFlamboyant tracery of Jean de Berry's time. That amateur of art--sixth\r\nin descent from Henry and Aliénor--left his mark all through middle\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Poitiers Cathedral is an ample parallelogram of eight\r\nbays, divided into three aisles of equal height, by a dozen widely\r\nspaced piers, each of which is a cluster of lovely shafts rising from\r\npavement to vault-springing. The eighteen _bombé_ vault sections are\r\ngrace itself. As the light floods in from the big lancets in the side\r\nwalls, one scarcely notices that this church has ground supports. The\r\nplan of Poitou's Romanesque churches--seen at its best at St.\r\nSavin[199]--shows adroit construction, since it employed the aisles to\r\nbuttress the principal span, and used one roof to cover the entire\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nPoitiers' memorable Crucifixion window is in the flat, eastern wall of\r\nthe central aisle. The three windows in that square chevet belong to the\r\ntransition between the XII and XIII centuries. That to the north was the\r\ngift of Maurice de Blason, who became bishop of Poitiers in 1198, and\r\nwho is supposed to have been also the donor of the Crucifixion, whose\r\ndate has given rise to controversy. The straight saddle-bars still used\r\nin it were abandoned after 1200. In the lower panel of the central\r\nlight, the founders of the cathedral, Henry and Aliénor, are pictured\r\nkneeling. Aliénor knew well Suger's school of glassmakers, and as M.\r\nMâle has proved that all the XII-century windows in western France\r\nproceed from those of St. Denis, very likely the ex-queen of France was\r\ninstrumental in spreading their fame. At Poitiers the apostles gaze\r\nupward in quite the same attitude as those in the Ascension window at Le\r\nMans, an accepted work of Suger's craftsmen.\r\n\r\nBlue as profound as sapphires and a crimson that glows like blood-red\r\nrubies make of Poitiers' Crucifix an unapproachable glory. The genius\r\nwho conceived it had brooded over the ecstatic hymn composed for the\r\nglad celebration of November 19, 569. This is the Tree of Life,\r\neffulgent in fecundity, on its branches hanging such fruit as the Ransom\r\nof the World, the vine that gives sweet wine of the red blood of the\r\nLord. No agonizing Christ on Poitiers' Cross _ornata regis purpura_. The\r\nSaviour's eyes are wide open to indicate that the Christ dies not. The\r\narms are extended to great length as if embracing the entire world.[200]\r\nThe halo is marked by the Greek cross, emblem of divinity. In many other\r\nchevets of France the Crucifixion holds the central place, in the Lady\r\nchapel at Tours, in the clearstory at Rouen, in the ambulatory at\r\nBourges, in St. Remi's wide gallery at Rheims, in the square east wall\r\nof Moulins, and at Ervy. And in many ways was the Sacrifice presented;\r\nsometimes the Cross became an apple-decked Tree of Knowledge with Adam\r\nand Eve beside it; sometimes the Saviour's arms were high uplifted and\r\nangels received the precious blood in chalices. Never was the meaning of\r\nCalvary presented with more profundity than at Poitiers, whose ancient\r\nbishops had suffered exile to defend the Son and written verses to exalt\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe other lancets of the cathedral are in most part XIII-century work of\r\nthe closely woven pattern type that produces scintillation; contrary to\r\nthe more general usage the medallions are to be read from the top\r\ndownward. As color schemes they have been composed with extraordinary\r\ncare. Few church interiors can equal this for jeweled riches: 'And the\r\nbuilding of the wall thereof was of jasper stone.... And the foundations\r\nof the wall were adorned with all manner of precious stones--jasper,\r\nsapphire, chalcedony, emerald, sardonyx, sardius, chrysolite, beryl,\r\ntopaz, chrysoprasus, jacinth, and amethyst.'\r\n\r\nPoitiers' ancient church of Notre Dame-la-Grande has the appearance of a\r\ncathedral, and its elaborate front, the best of all Romanesque façades,\r\nis classed among peerless works such as Vézelay's portico, St. Gilles'\r\nportal, and the Auvergnat apses. The pre-Gothic school of Poitou,\r\nformulated as early as 1050, excelled in sculptured frontispieces,\r\ndecorated apses, and ornate window frames. Sometimes the side aisles\r\nbracing the principal span were made too narrow, as here in Notre Dame,\r\nbut where the school reached its structural apogee as in St.\r\nSavin-sur-Gartemps (which has lofty ample aisles and splendidly carved\r\ncapitals), it can hold its own with that of any region. Poitou has been\r\ncalled the paradise for lovers of Romanesque architecture.\r\n\r\nIn Notre Dame-la-Grande are some XII-century frescoes, but its modern\r\nexperiment in polychromy is distressing. Many a gathering has the\r\nancient church seen. When in 1100 a church council at Poitiers censured\r\nthe illegal marriage of the king of France and the fair Bertrada de\r\nMontfort, Guillaume IX, the troubadour duke of Aquitaine who was\r\npresent--and in much the same predicament, living with the wife of a\r\nneighboring lord--made a scene and indignantly left the hall. Stones\r\nwere thrown at the churchmen who dared censure an open scandal. Then\r\nbrave Robert d'Abrissel, founder of Fontevrault, tore off his cloak and\r\nstood forth, in token of his willingness to suffer in so good a\r\ncause.[201]\r\n\r\nPoitiers' abbey church of St. Hilaire has much interest for\r\narchæologists.[202] The Vandals destroyed a church here, the Saracens\r\nburned another, twice was it wrecked by Norse pirates during the IX\r\ncentury when St. Hilary's relics were carried to Le Puy Cathedral for\r\nsafety. Then a daughter of the Duke of Normandy, Emma, the mother of\r\nEdward the Confessor, had her architect, Gautier Coorland, rebuild the\r\nabbatial, which was dedicated in 1049. Owing to continuous\r\nreconstructions, little of that period remains, save in the ambulatory\r\nand in the tower which once stood isolated. The XII century added the\r\noblong cupolas whose only counterparts are to be found at Le Puy. To\r\nsupport its new cupola-vaulting, St. Hilaire built two rows of pillars\r\nwith a narrow passageway between, and when, in later times, outer aisles\r\nwere added, the interior was given the uncommon aspect of triple aisles.\r\nA Huguenot sacking worked irreparable damage, and after the Revolution\r\nthe westernmost bays of the church had to be demolished.\r\n\r\nIn Merovingian times the two most-visited shrines in France were St.\r\nHilary's at Poitiers, and St. Martin's at Tours. When Hilary, the\r\nthirteenth bishop here (d. 368), returned from his exile in Phrygia,\r\nwhither he had been driven for combating the Arian heresy, he brought\r\nback from the East a fondness for the interpretation of Scripture by\r\nallegory which was to have a strong influence on the iconography of\r\nGothic cathedrals. To pray by St. Martin's tomb at Tours there came\r\nnorth the Italian poet, Venantius Fortunatus, who continued his\r\npilgrimage to the tomb of St. Hilary, the master who had trained Martin\r\nin the spiritual life. Never was he to quit Poitiers, where, in 607 he\r\ndied, its revered bishop.\r\n\r\nIn those days, Radegund, the Thuringian wife of Clotaire, son of Clovis,\r\nhad retired to Poitiers to pass her life in study and prayer. Scripture\r\nand the works of the church fathers were read in Greek and Hebrew, in\r\nher cloister. About her gathered pious maidens, chiefly of the\r\nGallo-Roman stock, harried by the rougher peoples from the north.\r\nFortunatus became for Queen Radegund and her Abbess Agnes a sort of\r\nself-appointed intendant; he sent them gifts of fruit with verses.\r\nPuvis de Chavannes has painted it all on the walls of Poitiers' Town\r\nHall.\r\n\r\nSt. Radegund's tomb became a pilgrim shrine. The savants see no reason\r\nto doubt the genuine antiquity of the queen's sarcophagus of black\r\nmarble now in the crypt of her church, part of which crypt escaped the\r\nfire of 1083 and so dates before 1000. The new apse was dedicated in\r\n1099. The three big bays of the aisleless nave are covered by\r\nPlantagenet Gothic vaults with eight branches, and along the walls are\r\nthe same blind arcades and carved carbels as in the cathedral. The\r\nsacristy shows an octagonal dome on ribs. The church has no transept,\r\nbut over the north portal is a XIII-century rose window of deep blue\r\nhue, between which and the apse are some XIV-century windows that\r\nexperimented not very successfully with colored figures in white glass.\r\nThe porch is good Flamboyant Gothic.\r\n\r\nPoitiers boasts the oldest extant Christian church in France, the\r\nbaptistry of St. Jean, in whose walls are Gallo-Roman IV-century\r\nvestiges.[203] There is VII-century Merovingian work in its apsidal\r\nchapels, and the later Romanesque and Gothic times added their quotas.\r\nThe ancient well in which baptism by submersion was practiced has been\r\npreserved. A son of Poitiers feels doubly a Christian if baptized in the\r\nchurch of St. Jean's.\r\n\r\nThe venerable little edifice to-day lies many feet below the level of\r\nthe city streets, for Poitiers escaped few of the sackings of history.\r\nFor safety from the Barbarian invasions some rich Gallo-Roman must have\r\nburied the statue of Minerva exhumed in 1902, in the garden of a girls'\r\nschool, and now in the town's museum. It is a most lovely Greek marble\r\nof the VI century, B.C.[204]\r\n\r\nHenry Plantagenet and Aliénor of Aquitaine built in Poitiers the guard's\r\nhall of the Counts' Palace, in the center of the town, on its highest\r\neminence.[205] The wall-arcading is like contemporary work in the\r\ncathedral and the church of St. Radegund. In late-Gothic times the south\r\nwall was remade. In this hall the second husband of Isabella of\r\nAngoulême made amends to his suzerain, Alphonse of Poitiers, for the war\r\nto which her jealous haughtiness had forced him. In this hall in 1307-08\r\nthe accused Templars were interrogated by Clement V, the pontiff who\r\ninitiated the residence at Avignon, and the consequent papal\r\nsubserviency to the French crown, Philippe le Bel cowed the pope, and\r\nthe group of anti-cleric legists who controlled the king arranged that\r\nonly picked specimens of the doomed military Order should appear at\r\nPoitiers. The royal coffers were empty and those of the Templars were\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nTorture and intimidation had wrung from all too many of the monk-knights\r\nfalse avowals of guilt. In Spain, where the investigation was carried on\r\nwithout torture, the bishops found no heresy in the Order; instead, they\r\nbore testimony to its exemplary standing. One brave old crusader raised\r\nhis voice in honest speech: \"Let him have a care,\" wrote Joinville,\r\n\"this king who now reigns. Let him amend his ways, lest God strike him\r\ndown without mercy.\" The Grand Master of the Templars, Jacques Molay,\r\nwas burned publicly in Paris, calling on king and pope to meet him\r\nbefore God's judgment seat within the year. A month later Clement V\r\ndied, and before 1314 closed, the young king met sudden death. And the\r\npeople recalled that when Clement was crowned at Lyons, the tiara had\r\nbeen knocked from his head by a collapsing wall and one of its precious\r\njewels lost.\r\n\r\nLess discouraging were other doings of Clement V in Poitiers. Here he\r\ndated the nomination of John of Montecorvino (d. 1328), pioneer of\r\nChristian missionaries, to the see of Peking. Armed crusading had run\r\nits course; the crusade by preaching, prayer, and penance was to begin.\r\nAlready in 1245 Innocent IV had sent Dominicans to Persia and\r\nFranciscans farther east, St. Louis had sent William de Rubruquis to the\r\nMongols, and those astonishing Venetian merchants; the Polos, had roused\r\nthe papacy to the spiritual needs of Cathay, the far Cathay of the\r\nmediæval tradition, to which Columbus was seeking a shorter route when\r\nhe accidentally discovered America. For thirty years John of\r\nMontecorvino missionized Tartary. He translated the New Testament and\r\nthe Psalms. To encourage missionary activity, Clement V ordered that\r\nGreek, Hebrew, and Arabic be taught publicly at Rome, Bologna, Paris,\r\nOxford, and Salamanca.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Years' War, so fatal to French architectural progress,\r\nsurged round Poitiers. After Crécy, in 1346, the hall of the Counts'\r\nPalace was damaged by the English. In the environs of Poitiers took\r\nplace the bitter French defeat of 1356, when King Jean le Bon was made\r\nprisoner. \"_Et fut là morte toute la fleur de chevalerie de France_,\"\r\nsays Froissart. The siege by Duguesclin to recapture the hill city from\r\nthe English damaged its monuments. When the Duke of Berry, son of King\r\nJean the Good, became master of Poitiers he undertook to restore the\r\nCounts' Palace, and he had noted Flamboyant Gothic masters construct for\r\nhim the splendid triple chimney piece of the guard hall, decorated about\r\n1383 by André Beauneveu with statues of Charles VI, of his wife Isabeau\r\nof Bavaria, and of Jean of Berry and his first duchess. In the pignon\r\nabove the great fireplaces was set some XIV-century glass. Guy de\r\nDammartin re-established the donjon tower called Maubergeon, now cut off\r\nat the third story. The images of the counts of Poitiers, decorating it,\r\nbelong to that phase of French sculpture which preceded the\r\nFranco-Flamand school at Dijon. Before transalpine influences were\r\nimported, a truly national renaissance had begun. The Tour Maubergeon\r\nand the pignon of the great hall are all that remain of the palaces\r\nbuilt at Poitiers by Jean de Berry; but what they were can be seen in\r\nhis illuminated Book of Hours now in Chantilly's museum.\r\n\r\nThe historic hall of Poitiers has its memories of Jeanne d'Arc. Hither,\r\nin 1429, Charles XII brought her to be examined by learned men. When one\r\nof them told her, with condescension, that if God wished to deliver\r\nFrance he had no need of men-of-arms, swift was Jeanne's reply, \"Man\r\ndoes the battling and God gives the victory.\" Finally her judges\r\nreported to the king that she was of sound sense and a true Christian\r\nand appeared to be sent of God, and that, given the desperate need of\r\nthe kingdom, they advised the king to put her at the head of an army for\r\nthe relief of Orléans. Decision momentous for the fate of France!\r\n\r\nJeanne, during her trial at Rouen, often referred to the answers she had\r\ngiven to her honest judges at Poitiers: \"If you do not believe me, send\r\nto Poitiers, where I was questioned before.... It is written in the book\r\nat Poitiers.\" Cauchon might wear a miter, well she knew it was not the\r\nChurch which persecuted her, though the English left no stone unturned\r\nto have it so appear. Jeanne in Poitiers lodged with Maître Jean\r\nRabateau, advocate, and it was the duty of his good dame to spy on her\r\nnight and day. Many years after she testified to Jeanne's habit of long\r\nprayer in the night-time. To test the maid's virtue the king's own\r\nmother-in-law visited her. That able Yolande of Aragon had brought up\r\nCharles VII. Her own son, the young knight René d'Anjou, was soon to\r\nfight under Jeanne, and Yolande, herself, convinced of the Maid's\r\nmission, helped with funds for the expedition to Orléans. They say that\r\nJeanne made answer to the court ladies with such sweetness and grace\r\nthat she drew tears from their eyes.\r\n\r\nThe old hill city of Poitiers, so ecclesiastical, so full of national\r\nmemories, has had the good sense to keep itself _très province_, and its\r\nstreet directory still makes a sort of calendar of saints. At Bourges,\r\nthe mania to wipe out its past has reached such a pass that the rue St.\r\nMichel is now the rue Michel-Servet and the rue St. Fulgent the rue\r\nFulton. Poitiers has no desire to blot out her high historic memories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGothic in the Midi\r\n\r\n     The giant struggle we have witnessed is but the beginning of a long\r\n     and complicated historical crisis in which men will have to make\r\n     their choice between the unlimited augmentation of power (by force,\r\n     riches, and success) and a forward-moving moral progress (by\r\n     justice, charity, and loyalty). If we live always in exterior\r\n     things, if we are always in movement, we become, little by little,\r\n     incapable of recollection and fecund meditation.\r\n\r\n    --GUGLIELMO FERRERO, 1917.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Midi adhered long, if not always, to\r\nRomanesque architecture, even when employing the Gothic vault. Gothic\r\nart was not an indigenous development in the south, but was brought in\r\nthe wake of political events, when central France and Languedoc became\r\none with the royal domain. It proceeded, in part, from the architecture\r\nof southwest France, and in part from the classic Ile-de-France Picard\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe realization of the local type of Midi Gothic was Albi's fortress\r\ncathedral, which comprises a wide unaisled hall covered by twelve bays\r\nof diagonal vaults whose span is sixty feet--the width of Amiens' nave\r\nbeing merely forty-five feet. The buttress are disguised as walls\r\nbetween the side chapels, the windows are long, narrow lancets, there is\r\nno triforium, and the roof is flat. Ogival art such as this has retained\r\nall the grand simplicity of Romanesque.\r\n\r\nThe chief care of the Midi architect was to avoid the flying buttress;\r\nhe had inherited Rome's admiration for wide, unincumbered interiors, and\r\nits aversion to showing the structural skeleton. His warm sun precluded\r\nthe use of wall inclosures that were composed entirely of stained glass,\r\nwhich fragile screens would have necessitated wide-spreading\r\nbuttresses. He seemed to disdain sculpture. And yet, during the\r\npre-Gothic day, Languedoc had excelled in that important branch of the\r\nbuilder's art, as Moissac's wealth of imagery and Elne's lovely cloister\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nVarious causes led to the nudity of sculpture in the later churches of\r\nthe south. The Gothic cathedrals of the Midi were erected after two\r\ngenerations of the Albigensian strife had impoverished the race. The new\r\nmendicant Orders of Francis and Dominic advocated austerity; the best\r\nGothic of Provence is the Dominican church of St. Maximin. The building\r\nmaterial available in some of the central and southern provinces did not\r\nlend itself to ornamentation; the lava of Auvergne, the granite of\r\nLimousin, and the brick of the Toulouse region are unyielding to\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nThe chief Gothic churches of the Midi were built in the second half of\r\nthe XIII and the first part of the XIV centuries. First there rose in\r\ncentral France the sister cathedrals of Clermont and Limoges--northern\r\nGothic infused with the regional spirit. Directly derived from them are\r\nthe cathedrals of Toulouse and Narbonne. Albi Cathedral was not begun\r\ntill 1282. The choir of Bordeaux, built by the first of the Avignon\r\npopes, is a classic of Rayonnant Gothic, and so is that jewel of\r\nCarcassonne Cité, the whilom cathedral of St. Nazaire. St. Sauveur, at\r\nAix-en-Provence, the cathedral of Rodez, and Béziers' fortified church\r\nwere the work of the successors of the apogee period of Gothic. At\r\nMontpellier, Mende, La Chaise Dieu, and Avignon, the XIV-century popes,\r\nall of whom were meridionals, built Gothic halls and chapels.\r\n\r\nMemorable and interesting as are the Gothic monuments of the Midi, the\r\ntraveler carries away the impression that the inmost soul of these\r\ncentral and southern provinces lingers most happily in the venerated\r\nshrines of Our Lady and St. Michael at Le Puy, in such churches as Notre\r\nDame-du-Port, St. Sernin, St. Trophime, in the sculptured portal of St.\r\nGilles, and in Maguelonne's isolated cathedral of St. Peter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLERMONT-FERRAND[206]\r\n\r\n     Si c'est un aveuglement surnaturel de vivre sans chercher ce qu'on\r\n     est, c'en est un terrible de vivre mal en croyant Dieu.... La\r\n     conduite de Dieu, qui dispose toute choses avec douceur, est de\r\n     mettre la religion dans l'esprit par les raisons, et dans le\r\n     coeur par la grâce.--PASCAL (1623-62; born in Clermont).\r\n\r\nIn mediæval reckoning that mountainous, central province of France which\r\nwas called Auvergne was counted in Languedoc. Therefore, to place the\r\ncathedral of Clermont in this general group of Midi Gothic is\r\npermissible. It is a daughter of Amiens, of the northern French type,\r\nand yet it belongs in a marked degree to its own volcanic region of\r\nmountains and storms. In it is the endurance and sturdy individuality of\r\nAuvergne, the inmost heart of France, where the Romanesque work may be\r\nsaid to be indigenous, so directly does it derive from the local\r\ntraditions of Rome grafted on those of Gaul, and scarcely touched by\r\nthose of Byzantium.\r\n\r\nThe chief Gothic church of Clermont has in it much of Romanesque\r\nausterity. The black lava of which it is built sets it apart among\r\nFrench cathedrals. \"A pious fear of God makes itself felt in this spot,\"\r\nwrote a son of Clermont, Gregory of Tours, of the cathedral governed by\r\nBishop Sidonius Apollinaris, Gallo-Roman and \"last zealot for Latin\r\nletters.\" And though not a stone of the present edifice is of historian\r\nGregory's day, one often murmurs in its precincts, \"_Terribilis est\r\nlocus iste_,\" and one often experiences in this abode of Jehovah the\r\nLord, _un frisson d'âme à la Pascal_. In Clermont, where even the serene\r\nGothic art could not free itself of the fire-torn mountains around, the\r\nsomber soul of Pascal first experienced religion. That he should\r\noverstress the fall of man and original sin, what wonder? But Jansenist\r\nin temperament though he was--overwhelmed by man's nothingness and God's\r\ngrandeur--the mystic Pascal was no rigid pessimist. Cathedral and man of\r\ngenius both preach the resurrection after the fall, both have the upward\r\nsurge of hope, even as the fearful summit of the Puy-de-Dôme, standing\r\nover Clermont, outsoars the storm clouds hiding its base, to rear its\r\nhead in sunlight.\r\n\r\nFor all its soberness, the cathedral of Clermont has the true Gothic\r\nsweep of the spirit _au-delà_. Happy the traveler who first approaches\r\nit at sunset, coming slowly across the mountain-walled plain, out of the\r\nForez hills of rushing torrents where is set the Chaise Dieu. The\r\ncathedral crowns the foothill around which has settled the city, and as\r\nit stands silhouetted against a bluish haze of mountain--the extinct\r\ncrater, the Puy-de-Dôme--it fulfills the ideal of a church crowning a\r\ncity.[207] Seen from the town, the massed volcanic hills are\r\nsufficiently near for their woods and villages to add picturesque\r\ndetails to the ever-changing views, yet not so close that they hang\r\noppressively over the city. Other views of the cathedral can be gained\r\nfrom the foothills around Royat, whose small, sturdy church was\r\nfortified to bar the valley into the huge mountain behind it.\r\n\r\nLava stone is dusty black, therefore on closer inspection Clermont\r\nCathedral has somewhat the aspect of the smoke-stained churches in\r\nmanufacturing centers. The gray-black Volvic stone is of better effect\r\nwithin the church, though at first that interior may strike a chill.\r\nLava does not lend itself to sculptural decoration. However, the\r\nessential lines of Clermont are of such masterly proportions, of so\r\ngrand a simplicity, that deeper and deeper grows the influence of this\r\nchurch on those who frequent it. The diagonals etched black against the\r\nwhite vault panels fall with peculiar ease and vigor on the tall dark\r\npiers. The slenderness of those clustered columns is not foolhardy,\r\nsince lava has much resistant force. The single aisles of the choir and\r\nthe double aisles of the nave rise to half the height of the church, and\r\nwe have seen at Bourges and Le Mans that when pier arches are above the\r\naverage height there is given to an edifice a note of exotic beauty.\r\nLike Amiens, the height of this church is three times greater than its\r\nwidth. Its vista is closed imposingly; the imaged windows of its high\r\napsidal chapels appear symmetrically behind the arches that surround the\r\nsanctuary.\r\n\r\nThe story of the chief church of Auvergne interests the archæologist.\r\nThe crypt belonged to the previous Carolingian church, and so did the\r\ntwo western towers until the XIX century. M. Viollet-le-Duc removed the\r\nancient belfries, extended the nave by two bays, and built the present\r\ntowers, whose sky-pointing spires are superb in the general view of\r\nClermont, but whose details can be criticized, as, for instance, the\r\nblocking of corner niches by pinnacles when the purpose of a niche is to\r\nhold a statue. Modern Gothic is too often a cold, hard imitation. The\r\nstair approaches here lack the old-time amplitude of the triple portals.\r\n\r\nThe XIII-century cathedral of Clermont was practically the first Gothic\r\nmonument raised in Auvergne, which province adhered stubbornly to its\r\nown exceptional Romanesque architecture. The first stone was laid in\r\n1248, in the same year that Cologne Cathedral was begun. The founder,\r\nBishop Hugues de la Tour, had attended the dedication of the\r\nSainte-Chapelle at Paris, and then had returned to Clermont to begin\r\nhis own cathedral. That same year he started out as a crusader, in the\r\ntrain of Louis IX, but as he died in Egypt the work on the church was\r\nnot continued seriously till 1253, when St. Louis helped to raise to the\r\nsee of Clermont his friend Guy de la Tour, nephew of Hugues. Belonging\r\nto a feudal family of great possessions, the new bishop, too, was able\r\nto be munificent toward his cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn 1254, when St. Louis was returning from his unsuccessful crusade, he\r\npaused in Clermont, to replenish his depleted treasury. Ten years later\r\nhe presented windows to the cathedral, on the occasion of his son\r\nPhilippe's marriage there to the daughter of Jaime el Conquistador of\r\nAragon. The lights in the Lady chapel show the fleur-de-lis and the\r\ndonjons of Castile, and are apparently the work of Paris craftsmen, who\r\ncontrolled the vitrine art of the later XIII century. That unskilled\r\nlocal workers set them in place would seem to be indicated by the\r\narmature bars which do not follow the contour of the medallions, as was\r\nthen the custom. In the choir's clearstory are the single figures and\r\ngrisaille that were in vogue during the next century.\r\n\r\nJean Deschamps made the plan of Clermont Cathedral. He may have studied\r\nin the north, since certain traits of Picardy appear here, but the\r\nspirit of the work is regional. His windows do not fill the entire upper\r\nspace between the active members. Under Bishop Guy de la Tour he\r\ndirected the building of the cathedral for almost forty years, till\r\n1287. Perhaps he designed the cathedral of Limoges, in west-central\r\nFrance, since its plan and details closely resemble those of Clermont.\r\nBishop Aymar de Cros, who carried on the works in Auvergne's capital,\r\nwas another of the schoolmen who were builders of churches; such was his\r\nintellect that St. Thomas Aquinas willed to him his manuscripts in the\r\nhope that his _Summa_ might be completed.\r\n\r\nUnder Bishop Aubert Aycelin de Montaigu a new master-of-works took\r\ncharge--Pierre Deschamps (1287-1325), the son probably of Jean who had\r\nmade the plans. He erected the four westernmost bays of the choir, the\r\ntransept, and the easternmost bay of the nave in its lower parts. From\r\n1340 to 1359 the master-of-works was Pierre de Cabazat, who added three\r\nmore bays to the nave, and was employed in those same years in making,\r\nwith Hugues Morel, the abbey church of La Chaise Dieu in the Forez\r\nmountains across the plain from Clermont.[208] An Avignon pope, Clement\r\nVI, was the patron who undertook that gaunt granite structure, as full\r\nof sorrow as the times that produced it. Clement had been abbot at La\r\nChaise Dieu, so naturally he contributed toward the erection of the\r\ncathedral of Auvergne as did his successor at Avignon, Innocent VI (d.\r\n1362), a former bishop of Clermont.\r\n\r\nThe city was fortunate to have one of the notable D'Amboise family for\r\nits prelate in the late-Gothic day, Jacques d'Amboise (1505-16), who as\r\nabbot of Cluny had built at Paris the stately residence called the Hôtel\r\nCluny. Close to his Auvergne cathedral he set up the Fontaine d'Amboise,\r\nnow on the Cours Sablon. The eloquent Massillon was a later bishop of\r\nClermont (1717-42); he founded its town library and bequeathed his\r\nfortune to the sick poor of the Hôtel Dieu. Before the French\r\nRevolution had turned to violence and destruction, in Clermont Cathedral\r\ngathered the people, with hearts beating high with generous desire for\r\nreform, for the blessing of their National Guard banner, embroidered by\r\na community of nuns. With all too tragic swiftness came the day when in\r\nthe same church were lighted bonfires for the destruction of vestments\r\nand missals. Among the precious things then wrecked was a portrait\r\nstatue of Louis IX, made while his friend Guy de la Tour was bishop.\r\nOnly by chance did the cathedral itself, riddled with bullets, escape\r\nannihilation.\r\n\r\nThe see of Clermont has gone by various designations; so ancient is this\r\ncity that it has been called successively by five different names. Here\r\nwhere is more Celtic blood than in any other region in France, save\r\nBrittany, the Celtic hero, Vercingetorex, inflicted on Cæsar his sole\r\ndefeat. When Gaul became Christian, Clermont continued to be important.\r\nHer first bishop, St. Austremonius, was one of the seven whom Gregory of\r\nTours says were sent into Gaul in 250 by Pope Fabian, with St. Denis of\r\nParis, St. Martial of Limoges, St. Saturninus of Toulouse, St. Just of\r\nNarbonne, St. Trophimus of Arles, and St. Gatien of Tours. At the close\r\nof the V century Clermont's bishop, the celebrated Caius Apollinaris\r\nSidonius, poet and scholar, son-in-law of an emperor, made his stand for\r\nLatin culture against Teutonic submersion. Dearly he loved his own\r\nenlightened Lyons, but of Clermont he said, \"Such an horizon would make\r\na stranger forget his native land.\" A generation later another\r\noutstanding Gallo-Roman bishop of Clermont was St. Gall, uncle of\r\nGregory of Tours, who was so just to all that even Jews marched with\r\nlighted tapers at his funeral. Some twenty-six of Clermont's bishops\r\nhave been canonized.\r\n\r\nThe third cathedral of the city, and that which immediately preceded the\r\npresent one, was consecrated in 946 by Bishop Étienne II. Clermont had\r\nsuffered grievously by Saracen invasion, followed by the Northmen\r\ninroads. After the second Norman sacking the ruined houses smoldered for\r\na month, and in the streets corpses lay unburied, for the population in\r\nterror had fled to the countryside. The bishop called back his flock to\r\nremake their homes. In his new church was a precocious use of ambulatory\r\nand radiating chapels, a disposition which was to lead to the chief\r\nbeauty in the Gothic cathedrals of the land, but which made its\r\nappearance in the Ile-de-France only in the XII century. Bishop\r\nÉtienne's Carolingian cathedral became the prototype for the\r\nAuvergnat-Romanesque school.\r\n\r\nIn the good Étienne's church prayed the first crusaders when by papal\r\nbidding there gathered at Clermont a mighty council at whose tenth and\r\nlast session was preached the First Crusade. Nature herself seemed to\r\nhave prepared the people's minds for some vast enterprise, for all the\r\nchroniclers of western Christendom describe the sublime shower of astral\r\nstars, thick as snowflakes, which whirled in the sky. So in this same\r\nprimeval Auvergne, some six centuries earlier, at the break-up of Rome's\r\nempire before the invading Barbarians, there had for three years been\r\nearthquakes and fiery volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nTradition says that the momentous gathering of 1095 took place in what\r\nis now the Place Delille and the adjacent Cours Sablon. Many of our\r\nbuilding friends were present--Bishop Odo from Bayeux, Bishop Ives from\r\nChartres, Bishop Hoël from Le Mans, the abbots Geoffrey of Vendôme,\r\nJarenton of St. Bénigne, and St. Hugues of Cluny, and from Spain came\r\nthe great Bernardo who ruled the see of Toledo. For the people of\r\nClermont to-day, November 28, 1095, is as vivid a reality as any of the\r\nrevolutions of yesterday. A statue of Urban II stands outside the\r\ncathedral. Even so he stood, said a witness, as one having authority,\r\nhigh above the vast throng, on one side of him the stunted Peter the\r\nHermit of Picardy, and on the other the Norman-Italian Bohemund of\r\nTaranto, a veritable Greek god in build and feature. From end to end of\r\nFrance Urban journeyed to arouse the people. Now he used persuasion, now\r\ninvective; sometimes he appealed to idealistic motives or propounded\r\ncolonial policies very like modern ideas. Europe had good cause to be\r\napprehensive. The Almoravids had advanced into Spain. The Seljukian\r\nTurks were a menace more serious than the Saracens. Urban understood the\r\nperil and raised his voice in warning. \"Cease to be a terror to peaceful\r\ncitizens,\" he exhorted the gathered barons. \"Turn your arms to the\r\ndefense of the soil trod by the King of Kings, of the tomb over which\r\nrose the sun of the Resurrection.... The great cities of Asia Minor have\r\nfallen a prey to the Mussulman, who has planted the crescent by the\r\nHellespont, whence he menaces Europe.... Nation of the Franks, set\r\nbeyond the mountains, nation cherished and chosen of God, as clearly\r\nyour high deeds prove, nation distinct from others by your situation, by\r\nyour faith, by your respect for Mother Church, to you I address my\r\nplea.... Who should right these wrongs but you who have received from on\r\nhigh agility of body, the training of arms and grandeur of soul?...\r\nCease these mutual wars!... Jesus Christ died for you. You should be\r\nwilling to die for him.\" And a great answering cry rose from the hundred\r\nthousand gathered there, \"God wills it,\" to be the rallying call of the\r\ncrusades.\r\n\r\nThus in the heart of France a French pope initiated the cosmic ventures\r\nwhich were to change European ways of life, ventures in which Frenchmen\r\nplayed a leading part so that to this day a European is called a Frank\r\nby a Mohammedan. One can easily see in the crusades only their failures\r\nand their crimes, one can sneer at them with Voltaire--who sneered at\r\nJeanne d'Arc. Europe's aggression was needed then to save Christianity\r\nfrom Asiatic immobility. The benefits of the crusades outweigh their\r\ndelinquencies.\r\n\r\n_Gesta Dei per Francos_ a monk called his chronicle of the First\r\nCrusade. And while those feats by God through the men of France in the\r\nEast went on, other feats for God were ventured in France, the raising\r\nof Gothic cathedrals, sister movements that gave wings to the soul,\r\npurifying and molding the faith and the genius of those virile and\r\nfaulty generations. Already the movement was stirring. On his way to\r\nClermont, Urban II had seen Verona Cathedral building and S. Ambrogio's\r\nat Milan. He had blessed S. Abondio at Como. In France he blessed the\r\nnew choir of St. Sernin at Toulouse and the material gathered for the\r\ncathedral at Carcassonne. Cluny's new choir he dedicated, and various\r\nother Romanesque churches. Before the Second Crusade set out Suger had\r\nbuilt St. Denis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Notre Dame du Port at Clermont-Ferrand. Typical\r\nXII-century Church of Auvergne's Romanesque School_]\r\n\r\nIn Clermont, though the cathedral of 1095 has been superseded by the\r\npresent Gothic structure, there is intact a venerated sanctuary where\r\nUrban had a votive Mass chanted on the eve of the historic council.\r\nEvery morning one can see the men and women of the city gather in the\r\ncrypt of Notre Dame-du-Port to beg a blessing on their working day. They\r\nmay not be able to put into words what it is each feels in that\r\nsubterranean chamber impregnated by the petitions of those of their race\r\nwho have gone before them, but each knows that here his prayer has\r\nplenitude and patriotic aspiration. A _custodia matutina_ in Notre\r\nDame-du-Port, _usque ad noctem_ in the cathedral. One fears God in the\r\ncathedral, one loves God in Notre Dame.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame-du-Port is a masterpiece of the Romanesque school of\r\nAuvergne.[209] When it was built lava stone was not in use for\r\nconstruction, but solely for decorative purposes. So curiously alike are\r\nall the pre-Gothic churches in this province that one architect might\r\nhave planned them. The venerable crypt of Notre Dame-du-Port was built\r\nin the XI century. The Romanesque church above it was constructed during\r\nthe XII century and has all the Auvergnese traits: a central tower in\r\ntwo stories set on a barlong which forms a kind of upper transept, a\r\ncompact apse with snug absidioles whose exterior walls are decorated by\r\ncolored volcanic stones in marquetry designs, a western narthex, and a\r\nprincipal span covered by a half-barrel vault undivided by transverse\r\narches and buttressed by side aisles surmounted by tribunes, which\r\nmeant that light entered the middle vessel indirectly. Auvergne, like\r\nBurgundy, attempted to light her upper church by a clearstory, but found\r\nthe experiment hazardous and gave it up. Her churches have stood intact\r\nthrough centuries of harsh winters. The very mortar lines were made\r\nmeans of decoration; wide bands of red mortar were found to be effective\r\nwith blocks of black lava.[210] In the volcanic soil of Auvergne were\r\nelements that rendered mortar as resistant as stone. The local\r\nGallo-Romans had used the polychrome lava as decoration.\r\n\r\nThe interior apse of Notre Dame-du-Port is a gem of masoncraft. Around\r\nthe tiny processional path stand engaged pillars that are decoration and\r\nbuttresses, too. The regional skill in sculpture appears in the capitals\r\nof the main piers, where the story is related with animation, even if\r\nthe figures are too squat and the heads too large. The armor indicates\r\nthat the work was done early in the XII century. The doorjamb images at\r\nthe southern entrance of the transept were sculptured in the years when\r\nSt. Thomas Becket came to Clermont wearing the white robe of the\r\nCistercians who had given him hospitality in France. Crowds gathered\r\nevery day to receive his blessing, for all Christendom held him to be a\r\nsaint defending right and liberty. A cast of Clermont's archaic portal,\r\nwhose charm is exceptional, with its seraphim of the mystic triple\r\nwings, has been placed in the Trocadéro Museum at Paris. When this side\r\nentrance was completed, Richard Coeur-de-Lion was making over his\r\nclaims in Auvergne to his lifetime rival, Philippe-Auguste, which\r\ncession was to lead, in time, to the erection of the Ile-de-France\r\nPicardy cathedral of Clermont.\r\n\r\nSome of the most admirably sculptured capitals in Auvergne are at Mozac,\r\na suburb of Riom.[211] The nave of Mozac's abbey church was built from\r\n1131 to 1147 by a brother of Peter the Venerable, who made Cluny's nave,\r\nand of the doughty abbot, Pons de Montboissier, who erected Vézelay's\r\nportico of paradise, all three of them belonging to a feudal family of\r\nAuvergne. The small abbatial holds a priceless treasure, the reliquary\r\nof St. Calmin, which an abbot presented in 1168. Its fourteen panels of\r\nLimoges enamel are ornamented in gold. A bold attempt was made to rob\r\nthe church of this national heritage, so it is now protected by electric\r\nbells and every kind of burglar alarm.\r\n\r\n\"_Clermont le riche, Riom le beau_,\" so ran the old saying. Riom, the\r\nsmall but proud rival of the capital of Auvergne, was a town of\r\nmagistrates who built themselves Gothic Renaissance houses as individual\r\nas the pre-Gothic work of the province. The church of St. Amable has a\r\nRomanesque nave and an early-Gothic choir. Jean, Duke of Berry, had Guy\r\nand André de Dammartin design the XIV-century Sainte-Chapelle for his\r\npalace at Riom. Its brilliantly cold stained glass was commanded for the\r\nwedding, in 1389, of sixty-year-old Duke John and the thirteen-year-old\r\nheiress, Jeanne de Boulogne. Froissart has described the curious union.\r\nEach window panel has a single statue under a canopy; the prophets and\r\napostles carry appropriately inscribed scrolls. A XV-century window,\r\nrepresenting the Bourbon dukes, Jean II and Pierre II, patrons of\r\nMoulins, contains a St. Marguerite so similar to one in the \"Book of\r\nHours\" which Jehan Fouquet painted for Étienne Chevalier that the window\r\nis thought to be designed by the great _primitif_ of Tours.\r\n\r\nIt may be to artists of Jean de Berry's entourage that we owe the most\r\nentrancing Madonna of Flamboyant art, the _vierge à l'oiseau_, an image\r\nin the regional stone which stands at the trumeau of the XV-century\r\nchurch of Notre Dame-du Mathuret. One student after another has\r\ndiscussed the date of this exquisite figure, so purely French in\r\nessence, whose simplicity is as ample and unaffected as the best\r\nXIII-century art. Work as exceptional as this is of no date or school,\r\nbut is due to some unrecorded individual genius. In that same\r\nlate-Gothic day the spirit of St. Louis and Joinville lived again in\r\n_The Very Joyous, Pleasing and Diverting History of the Gentle Lord of\r\nBayard, written by the Loyal Servitor_.\r\n\r\nThe serrated foliage of the Madonna's crown proves the sculpture to be\r\nlate-Gothic. M. Gonse places it midway in the XIV century, M. Vitry\r\nearly in the XVI, and M. Enlart thinks that it could not have been\r\nproduced before the XV century. MM. Mâle, Palustre, Merimée, and others\r\nhave discussed it. In the ideal innocence and dignity of the Virgin is\r\nMichel Colombe's charm. The legend was that in Egypt the infant Jesus\r\nmodeled images of birds, then breathed on them, imparting life. This is\r\nthe mystic moment which the unknown master of Riom chose to render;\r\nthere is a brooding reverence in the young mother's face as she gazes at\r\nher Son, who ponders in a divine wonderment at a bird about to fly from\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE CATHEDRAL OF LE PUY[212]\r\n\r\n     Into whatever country you carry war, remember that children, women\r\n     and churchmen and the poor are not your enemies.--(Dying words of\r\n     BERTRAND DUGUESCLIN, killed near Le Puy, 1380).\r\n\r\nLe Puy is hoary with history. Perched high on basaltic rocks near the\r\nsource of the Loire, picturesque beyond description, it stood on the\r\ngreat pilgrimage route from Italy to Compostela, the _Via Francigena_ by\r\nwhich French art and poetry passed into Spain and penetrated to Italy,\r\nalong whose pilgrim roads are found portal images of the Round Table\r\nheroes and the sculptured tympanums of France.[213] The cathedral is\r\nbuilt near the top of the town's hill, and above it on the hillcrest has\r\nbeen set a mammoth statue of Our Lady cast from cannon taken at\r\nSebastopol. In the immediate suburbs rises another mass of volcanic\r\nrock, a needle some two hundred and fifty feet in height. The oldest\r\npart of the chapel crowning that extraordinary little basalt mountain\r\ndates before the year 1000. The sanctuary is trefoil, like the\r\nearly-Christian churches at Rome, and like St. Laurent at Grenoble.[214]\r\nAt the end of the XI century St. Michel d'Aiguille was enlarged\r\nirregularly. From time immemorial a shrine dedicated to the Archangel\r\nhas crowned the pinnacle: \"In the presence of angels I shall sing my\r\npsalms.\"\r\n\r\nThe approach to the cathedral of Le Puy, while less difficult than the\r\nprecipitous needle of St. Michel, is equally romantic and solemn. You\r\nmount the hill by the Street of Tables, so called from the days of\r\npilgrimages, when the merchants' booths lined it. As you climb, the way\r\nchanges to a broad flight of steps, more than a hundred, and up and up\r\nyou mount, with the polychromatic façade of the cathedral rising before\r\nyou on high. Then suddenly, almost before you are aware of what has\r\nhappened, you pass right under that western front of the church,\r\nascending always, climbing under the cathedral's western bays. Formerly\r\nyou could have mounted right into the very sanctuary itself, coming to\r\nit through the pavement. To-day the stairway branches, and you enter the\r\nchurch at the side. Never was there such an approach to the House of\r\nPrayer as this, never a more sublime and grandiose conception than the\r\nshadowed stair over which hangs the façade. Halfway up, where stand red\r\nporphyry columns and doors of chiseled bronze, is carved, \"If you do not\r\nfear crime, fear to cross this threshold, for the Queen of Heaven wishes\r\na devotion without stain.\"\r\n\r\nM. Thiollier has shown that the Romanesque school of the Velay region\r\nwas an intermediary between Burgundy, Auvergne, and the Midi, with the\r\nmeridional influences the strongest. Le Puy's choir, transept, and two\r\nbays of the nave were erected in the XI century, and of that date is the\r\ncloister walk that touches the church. The transept has a tribune at\r\neach end. Beyond the chevet stood a tower of which the actual one is a\r\nreplica. As all the level space available was covered by these\r\nstructures, it became necessary, when they wished to lengthen the nave\r\nin the XII century, to build out from the hill a vast masonry foundation\r\nas a platform. It is under those westernmost bays that mounts the\r\nstairway of Wonderland. Each bay of the nave is covered by an oblong\r\ncupola set on an octagonal base, of a type found again only at Poitiers,\r\nin the church of St. Hilaire. At Le Puy the side aisles buttress the\r\ncupolas.\r\n\r\nNo one should miss seeing a XV-century fresco discovered under\r\nwhitewash, in 1860, in the library off the cloister. The Liberal Arts\r\nare symbolized by women of the type of Anne of Brittany with bombous\r\nforeheads, and at the feet of each sits a disciple. Thus Aristotle, with\r\nthe sensitive face of a scholar, is seated at the feet of Logic, and\r\nCicero learns of Rhetoric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Le Puy in Old Auvergne_]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Le Puy has been venerated and visited by practically\r\nevery ruler of France from Charlemagne to Francis I. This ancient city\r\nwas almost chosen as the meeting place for launching the First Crusade.\r\nUrban II paused here in 1095, and the bishop of Le Puy, Adhémar de\r\nMonteil (1087-1100), accompanied him to Clermont, and when the pope's\r\ngreat rallying speech was ended it was Bishop Adhémar, his face shining\r\nwith enthusiasm, who first stepped forward to take the cross. Urban\r\nappointed him the spiritual chief of the expedition, and his skill in\r\nmilitary strategics proved of use since he had been a knight before\r\nbecoming a churchman. This good man died in the grievous days at\r\nAntioch, worn out with his efforts to check disorders in the crusaders'\r\ncamp. To Adhémar de Monteil has been attributed the _Salve Regina_\r\ncalled in the olden times the anthem of Puy. To Le Puy's famous shrine\r\nSt. Louis presented a thorn from the Crown he had obtained from\r\nConstantinople, and on his way back from his first crusade he deposited\r\nin the church the curious image of a black Virgin given him in Egypt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF LIMOGES[215]\r\n\r\n    Bien me sourit le doux printemps,\r\n    Qui fait venir fleurs et feuillages;\r\n    Et bien me plait lorsque j'entends\r\n    Des oiseaux le gentil ramage.\r\n    Mais j'aime mieux quand sur le pré\r\n    Je vois l'étendard arboré,\r\n    Flottant comme un signal de guerre.\r\n    Quand j'entends par mont et par vaux\r\n    Courir chevalier et chevaux\r\n    Et sous leur pas frémir la terre,\r\n    Et gens crier: \"A l'aide! A l'aide!\"\r\n    De voir les petits et les grands\r\n    Dans les fossés roulers mourants.\r\n    A ce plaisir tout plaisir cède.[216]\r\n    --BERTRAN DE BORN (1140-1215).\r\n\r\nAlthough in plan, in the mode of construction, in the covering of\r\nchapels and various details, the resemblances between the cathedrals of\r\nClermont and Limoges are such that it is thought the same Jean Deschamps\r\ndesigned both, the cathedral of St. Étienne at Limoges possesses its own\r\nindividual character because of the fine-grained, compact granite of\r\nwhich it is built and the unusual talent of its masons. M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc considered the apse of Limoges one of the most scientific\r\nof Gothic constructions. The very beautiful leaf foliage is as crisply\r\ncut as when it came from the master's hand. Full of character are the\r\nprofiles of the molds used in the triforium for decorative effect.\r\n\r\nBecause of the enduring quality of their building material, the\r\nRomanesque edifices of Limousin lasted so well that there was little\r\ntemptation to tear them down in order to substitute Gothic churches.\r\nTill the Revolution, Limoges kept its great pre-Gothic abbatial of St.\r\nMartial, and its cathedral was, like that of Clermont in Auvergne, an\r\nisolated example of Gothic. Like Clermont's chief church, the western\r\nbays of Limoges were not built till the XIX century. The general aspect\r\nof St. Étienne is Rayonnant. Its Flamboyant Gothic additions were held\r\nin rigorous restraint. When Bishop Aimeric de la Serre (1246-73), a man\r\nof wealth, determined to remake his church, he willed his fortune to the\r\nenterprise. As Bishop Aimeric had just died, the first stone was laid on\r\nJune 1, 1273, by Hélie de Malemort, doyen of the chapter. For over fifty\r\nyears they built steadily till under Bishop Hélie de Talleyrand the\r\nchoir was completed in 1327. A second period of work, from 1344 to the\r\nend of the century, resulted in the south arm of the transept whose rose\r\nis Rayonnant, whereas that to the north is Flamboyant. In its tendency\r\nto eliminate the horizontal line Limoges is eminently a church of the\r\nXIV century. The shafts before the piers rise unbroken from pavement to\r\nvault-springing; the pier arches at the apse curve are very pointed. Yet\r\nthere is no geometric dryness in this interior. Plain wall surfaces\r\nabove the main arcade and around the triforium and clearstory add to its\r\nrobust aspect.\r\n\r\nIn 1370 the Black Prince sacked Limoges and left little but the\r\ncathedral standing. Froissart recounts that \"there was no pity taken of\r\nthe poor people who had wrought no manner of treason ... more than three\r\nthousand persons of all ages and both sexes were slain that day ... and\r\nthe city clean brent and brought to destruction.\" It took time and\r\ntreasure to repair the devastation. Only from 1458 to 1490 were the two\r\neasternmost bays of the nave erected.\r\n\r\nThe fourth period of energy at Limoges, from 1515 to 1530, created a gem\r\nof Flamboyant Gothic, the transept's north façade, which is called the\r\nPortail de St. Jean, as it stood near a church dedicated to the Baptist.\r\nBishop Philippe de Montmorency began it, and his successor, César de\r\nVilliers de l'Isle-Adam, completed it, as their carved armorials bear\r\nwitness. Because it stood on the emplacement of the old Romanesque\r\ntransept, it was somewhat too narrow. To obviate that impression the\r\ncorner buttresses were offset at an angle. The wooden doors of this, the\r\nmain entrance to Limoges Cathedral, are of the Renaissance. They\r\nrepresent the stoning of St. Stephen, and the first Christian missionary\r\nof Limousin, St. Martial, to whom an early local martyr, St. Valérie, is\r\npresenting her decapitated head. The ring of St. Valérie gave symbolic\r\ninvestiture to the dukes of Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nLimoges was active in the Renaissance days. Her bishop, Jean de Langeac,\r\nerected an elaborate _jubé_ between choir and transept, a rood loft\r\nwhich is one mass of hanging keystones, channeling, bas-reliefs, and\r\narabesque panels, with six big statues of the Virtues made in 1536 by an\r\nartist of Tours named Jean Arnaud. It is plain to see that the\r\nRenaissance was in full swing. The Labors of Hercules were set forth,\r\nand Bacchus was placed beside Ambrose and Augustine. Perhaps the huge\r\n_jubé_ and the episcopal tomb both came from the studios of Tours, where\r\nhad settled the earliest artists of the transalpine Renaissance. The\r\nmaster hand that made the bishop's tomb, says M. Mâle, followed Dürer,\r\nbut his eight Apocalypse panels were an improvement over the designs of\r\nthe German. Unfortunately the bronze recumbent figure of the munificent\r\nprelate whose pride it was to adorn his church was melted up for pennies\r\nin 1793. There are two other notable tombs in the choir's procession\r\npath--that of a bishop-builder, Raynaud de la Porte--the only funeral\r\nmonument in France that represents stone curtains drawn aside by\r\nangels--and the tomb of his nephew, Bernard Brun (d. 1350). Three of the\r\nAvignon popes were natives of art-loving Limousin.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution robbed Limoges of the noble abbey church of St. Martial,\r\nwhich had been dedicated by the pope of the First Crusade in 1095. St.\r\nMartial had formed the center of the Château section of Limoges, ruled\r\nby its own counts with a totally different administration from that of\r\nthe Cité division, where the cathedral stood, and whose civic master was\r\nthe bishop. Many a feud had Cité with Château. The abbatial of the\r\n\"apostle of Aquitaine\" would tell us the story had not blind passion\r\nlaid it in ruins.\r\n\r\nFor three hundred years no effort was made at Limoges to complete its\r\ncathedral's nave until, through the enterprise of Monseigneur Duquesnay,\r\nthe first stone of the sorely needed western church was laid in 1876 and\r\nthe structure finished in 1888. It was joined, by means of a narthex or\r\nforechurch, to the ancient tower which had been built isolated before\r\nthe Romanesque cathedral of St. Étienne. In its three lower stories, now\r\nhidden by cumbersome masonry propping, save on the east side, the tower\r\nbelonged to the cathedral which Urban II blessed in 1095 when he\r\ndedicated St. Martial's abbatial. Its four upper stories, mainly of the\r\nXII century, were begun by Bishop Sebrand-Chabot while the overlord of\r\nthe province, Richard Coeur-de-Lion, was on his crusading venture. In\r\nthis very region, at the castle of Chalus near Limoges, the Lion-hearted\r\nmet his death in 1199.\r\n\r\nThe dialect of Limousin was considered the purest form of Provençal by\r\nthe troubadours. Here in the west center of France, Coeur-de-Lion's\r\ntroubadour friend, the malignant breeder of dissensions, Bertran de\r\nBorn, had his castle of Hautefort south of Limoges. He excited Henry\r\nPlantagenet against his sons, and spurred on the sons to rebellion.\r\nUnlike the gentle Valérie who carries in her hands her own head with\r\nright Christian pride since she lost it to witness to the planting of\r\nthe Cross, Bertran de Born, sower of discord, is represented swinging\r\nhis severed head by the hair like a lantern. So Dante saw him in the\r\nninth chasm of hell herded with the malicious ones who had abused the\r\nattribute of reason: \"I made the father and the son rebels to each\r\nother,\" he wailed. \"Because I parted persons thus united, I carry my\r\nbrain, ah, me! parted from its source. Thus the law of retribution is\r\nobserved in me.\"[217] And equally merciless has been the law of\r\nretribution for Limoges, than which no other city has suffered more from\r\npillage, pest, and fire. Froissart tells us that during centuries the\r\nfrontier lands of Limousin and Gascony exercised brigandage as a\r\n_métier_.\r\n\r\nLike the three lower stories of the tower, the crypt belonged to the\r\nXI-century Romanesque cathedral of Limoges. On its groin vault was\r\npainted a Byzantinesque Christ surrounded by the symbols of the\r\nEvangelists. The cathedral has recently lost by theft some precious\r\nenamels. From father to son in Limoges passed the skill in this\r\nbeautiful art craft. St. Eloi was apprenticed to a goldsmith in Limoges\r\nin the VII century. At Le Mans is the XII-century plaque of Geoffrey\r\nPlantagenet, at Mozac an unrivaled Limousin reliquary, and Jean, duc de\r\nBerry, prince of amateurs, once possessed the best XIII-century work of\r\nLimoges enamel, the gold King's Cup, now in the British Museum. In St.\r\nPierre's at Chartres are the splendid Apostle plaques of the XVI century\r\nby Léonard Limosin. The earlier method had been to sink the enamel like\r\na jewel in cells or _cloisons_, hence the name _cloisonné_, but the\r\nRenaissance artists used no inclosing ribbon of metal.\r\n\r\nThe only ancient windows remaining in the cathedral's clearstory are the\r\ntwo at the apse end, which a canon, Pierre de la Rodier, presented. When\r\nhe became bishop of Carcassonne he built the south chapel that opens\r\nfrom St. Nazaire's nave (1323-30). In the cathedral chapels are some\r\nXV-and XVI-century lights, and fragments of earlier glass. On the same\r\nriver, Vienne, which at Limoges is crossed by two noble XIII-century\r\nbridges, lies Eymoutiers, some thirty miles to the west, between\r\nClermont and Limoges. Its remarkable collection of windows is entirely\r\nof the XV century; each panel contains a single figure in an\r\narchitectural setting.\r\n\r\nFrench writers claim that between Eymoutiers and Limoges took place the\r\napparition of the Infant Jesus to St. Anthony of Padua which became a\r\nfavorite theme with painters, but the Italians insist that Padua was the\r\nprivileged spot. Limoges city has its St. Anthony tradition. In its\r\nsquare, they say, while the saint was preaching in 1225, his audience\r\nwas untouched by a rainstorm that inundated the other townspeople. As we\r\nhave seen that the building of great churches was preceded in most cases\r\nby a spiritual regeneration, it is not extreme to think that the fervor\r\nroused in the Midi by the great son of St. Francis had much to do with\r\nthe laying of the corner stone of Limoges Cathedral in 1273.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF BORDEAUX[218]\r\n\r\n     Celuy qui, d'une doulceur et facilité naturelle, mépriseroit les\r\n     offenses reçues, feroit chose très belle et digne de louange: mais\r\n     celuy qui, picqué et oultré jusques au vif d'une offense,\r\n     s'armeroit des armes de la raison contre ce furieux appétit de\r\n     vengeance, et aprèz un grand conflict s'en rendroit enfin maistre,\r\n     feroit sans doubte beaucoup plus. Celuy là feroit bien; et celuy\r\n     cy, vertueusement: l'une action se pourroit dire bonté: l'aultre,\r\n     vertu; car il semble que le nom de la vertu présuppose de la\r\n     difficulté et du contraste. Nous nommons Dieu bon, fort, et\r\n     libéral, et juste, mais nous ne le nommons pas\r\n     _vertueux_.--MONTAIGNE (Mayor of Bordeaux from 1581 to 1585).\r\n\r\nWhile Bordeaux has the warm fertility of the Midi, there is much of the\r\nnorth in the big commercial city. And its cathedral of St. André is\r\ntypical of the dual temperament. The nave is the aisleless, wide hall\r\npreferred by meridionals, the choir has the procession path with its\r\ncirclet of chapels loved by the north. Excepting Le Mans, Amiens, and\r\nRheims, it is the longest cathedral in France.\r\n\r\nBordeaux was an important city in the wide possessions of the dukes of\r\nAquitaine. In 1137 Aliénor, the daughter of the last William, was wedded\r\nin its cathedral to the prince who immediately ascended the French\r\nthrone as Louis VII. When she left him after fifteen years and wedded\r\nHenry Plantagenet the rich city on the Garonne passed under English\r\nrule. In all the vicissitudes of the three hundred years that followed,\r\nfrom 1154 to 1453, Bordeaux' self-interest kept her faithful to her\r\nmasters beyond the sea, the chief customers in her wine trade. Bordeaux\r\nremained French, however, in race and in the expression of race,\r\narchitecture. Aliénor's second husband, Henry II of England, was, like\r\nherself, more French than English; of his thirty-four years' reign he\r\npassed only twelve in England, and his son, Coeur-de-Lion, was another\r\nAnglo-Frenchman.\r\n\r\nThe hardy, domelike vaults carried on diagonals that span the nave of\r\nAngers' Cathedral (c. 1150) have been considered the earliest extant\r\nexamples of the Gothic of the West. And yet it is possible, thinks M.\r\nBrutails, the erudite archivist of the Gironde, that the vaults of the\r\nsame type which were built over the nave of the present cathedral of\r\nBordeaux antedated the notable ones of Angers. In Bordeaux occurred one\r\nof the premature isolated examples of Gothic ribs under the south tower\r\nof Ste. Croix. During a revival of builder's energy, from 1052 to 1127\r\n(under the eighth and ninth dukes of Aquitaine), Ste. Croix and St.\r\nSeurin were reconstructed and St. André begun. It seems more reasonable\r\nto suppose, however, that Anjou, where first the cupola church of\r\nAquitaine met the diagonal ribs of northern France, should have been the\r\ncradle of that phase of the new architecture which we call Plantagenet.\r\n\r\nThe nave of St. André is a difficult page to read, Romanesque, Gothic,\r\nand Renaissance as it now is. The Romano-Byzantine church here which\r\nUrban II blessed in 1096 exists only in vestiges in the lower walls on\r\neither side of the wide hall. Originally the church had side aisles, but\r\nthey were obliterated when the XII century spanned the entire width with\r\nAngevin diagonals. The side walls were then made into two stories, a\r\nlower wall arcade surmounted by a window story, such as we have seen in\r\nthe cathedrals at Angers and Angoulême. In 1437 an earthquake caused the\r\ncollapse of the masonry roof of the four westernmost bays, which were\r\nrecovered by a Flamboyant Gothic vaulting rich with supplementary ribs.\r\n\r\nThe west front of St. André never was developed, as the church abutted\r\nthere on the ancient ramparts. The main entrance was the Porte Royale in\r\nthe north flank of the nave, whose statues, made in the golden hour of\r\nSt. Louis' reign, were used as models by Viollet-le-Duc when he refilled\r\nthe empty niches of Notre Dame at Paris. There can be no clearer\r\nexposition of what qualities were lost in Rayonnant Gothic than to pass\r\nfrom this apogee portal to the smoother, more conventional images at the\r\nnorthern entrance to the transept; in the rugged apostles, full of\r\ncharacter, is the touch which all time recognizes as genius; in the\r\naristocratic churchmen of the XIV-century door is mere talent. To the\r\nnave of Bordeaux a XVI-century archbishop, Charles de Grammont, who\r\ninitiated here the Italian Renaissance, added an elaborate buttress.\r\nThat miniature façade is called the _contrefort de Grammont_.[219]\r\n\r\nUnder Archbishop de Mallemort (1227-60) St. André superseded St. Seurin\r\nas the cathedral of Bordeaux. As late as 1259 it lacked a suitable\r\nchevet. Gascony was in chaos in those years when Henry III, builder of\r\nWestminster Abbey, sent the Earl of Leicester, Simon de Montfort (son of\r\nthe leader of the Albigensian Crusade), to straighten out the\r\ndisorders. That strong administrator, who was on the constitutional\r\nliberal side in English politics, was frustrated by Midi corruption.\r\nOnly as the XIII century closed was built the present splendid choir of\r\nBordeaux Cathedral, a classic work of Rayonnant Gothic before that phase\r\nturned to geometric rule. How technique cramped and killed inspiration\r\ncan be seen in the later Rayonnant church of St. Michel. At St. André,\r\nit is true, the capitals are slight and the profiles not overvirile.\r\nDecadence is foreshadowed, but not yet is the art academic and\r\nwiredrawn. The Midi appears in the clearstory and triforium, which do\r\nnot fill the entire space between the shafts. The partiality of the\r\nmeridional for unencumbered interiors had something to do with making\r\nthe procession path thirty feet wide. Most grateful is the traveler for\r\na curving aisle around the sanctuary after having sojourned among the\r\ncupola and hall-like churches of Anjou and Aquitaine. Bordeaux' choir\r\npossesses some good stained glass of its own period, and some of its\r\nbuttress statues are among the best imagery of the XIV century. Mary\r\nMagdalene, carrying her vase of ointment, appears as a chatelaine of the\r\nMiddle Ages with the bandeau under her chin then fashionable; Aliénor of\r\nAquitaine could not have been very unlike her.\r\n\r\nThe most active patron of St. André's Gothic choir was the archbishop of\r\nthe city, Bertrand de Got, who in 1305 became Clement V, the first\r\nAvignon pope. When he died, in 1314, the new choir was practically\r\ncompleted. His image stands at the trumeau of the transept's north door\r\n(the head and hand are reproductions), and around him are six prelates\r\nwho may be intended to represent the French bishops whom Clement raised\r\nto the cardinalate. In technique these images may surpass the\r\nweather-beaten apostles at the Porte Royale (c. 1260), but they are\r\ntheir inferior in spirit. Five of the statues are studies from the same\r\nmodel. Casts of the transept portal of Bordeaux are in the Kensington\r\nMuseum and in the Trocadéro. The Avignon popes were the chief art\r\npatrons of the XV century, with the four Valois princes--Charles V of\r\nFrance and his brothers at Dijon, Bourges, and Angers. No pontiff was\r\nmore munificent than Clement V. While he was bishop at St.\r\nBertrand-de-Comminges (Haute Garonne)[220] he renewed that small\r\ncathedral, which consists of two unequal parts, a Romanesque façade,\r\ndonjon tower, and forechurch of the day when St. Bertrand had been\r\nbishop (1073-1123), and an unaisled Gothic choir, begun by Bertrand de\r\nGot, continued by him while pope and finished by Bishop Hugues de\r\nChatillon, who died in 1352.\r\n\r\nThe Rayonnant chevet of Bordeaux Cathedral and its transept, two of\r\nwhose towers are spire-crowned, compose an effective architectural\r\ngroup, with a detached campanile in the gardens. In order to give\r\nemployment to the poor, Archbishop Pierre Berland, who had been a\r\nshepherd's son, erected the graceful, isolated tower for bells to hang\r\nin, \"that God might be praised in the sky.\" And the same generations\r\nbuilt St. Michel's tower (1472-92), the highest beacon in southwest\r\nFrance, mutilated mercilessly by M. Paul Abadie's restoration. The\r\nlifeless church before which it stands is proof of how much needed was\r\nthe vim, even if often exaggerated and bizarre, of the late-Gothic\r\nmovement. M. Enlart considers Bordeaux and Bayonne[221] to be two of the\r\nprincipal doors by which the English Curvilinear style entered France.\r\nThere its name is Flamboyant Gothic. And yet in this same Midi, M.\r\nAnthyme Saint-Paul, who denies the English origin of French late-Gothic\r\narchitecture, claims to have found proof of his theory that already in\r\nApogee Gothic and in the Rayonnant hour were developing the\r\ncharacteristics of the final phase. One cannot help but feel that the\r\nEnglish builders' partiality for exuberant decoration had something to\r\ndo with the making of such towers as St. Michel and the Pey Berland. The\r\nlandscape round Bordeaux is as rich in sky-pointing spires as Calvados\r\nin Normandy.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1451, the English surrendered Bordeaux, the great Dunois,\r\nJeanne d'Arc's companion in arms, was received as conqueror in its\r\ncathedral (where in 1376 the Black Prince had accepted the citizens'\r\noath of fealty to his father), and to the ringing of bells and cries of\r\n\"_Noël_,\" Archbishop Pierre Berland and the chief men of the town swore\r\nto be loyal subjects of France.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient churches of historic interest in Bordeaux is Ste.\r\nCroix, rebuilt by Charlemagne when Saracens destroyed it, and again\r\nremade (1099) as Romanesque according to the school of Poitou. Under its\r\ntower, Gothic ribs were used early in the XII century. The church was\r\npartly wrecked in 1179 and revaulted at the end of the XIII century. In\r\nthe sculpture of the rich façade is a certain Assyrian note. M. Brutails\r\ncomplains that Abadie, the restorer, made of the frontispiece a\r\nneo-Angoumois work and that the north tower is entirely of his building.\r\n\r\nMemories of the great Emperor Charles haunt the former cathedral of\r\nBordeaux, St. Seurin. Fundamentally it belongs to the cupola type of\r\nedifice, and though incessantly rebuilt up to the XV century, it\r\npresents the aspect of a Romanesque church. The south portal (c. 1260),\r\nsculptured with elaborate foliate ornament, has images of unequal merit.\r\nIn St. Seurin, says tradition, Charlemagne paused, in 778, with the\r\nbodies of the heroes of Roncevaux to be buried at Blaye, his nephew\r\nRoland and that paladin's comrade, Sire Olivier, and Archbishop Turpin\r\nof Rheims, who fought pagans--_par granz batailles et par mult bels\r\nsermuns_. On the altar of St. Seurin the emperor laid the horn that\r\nRoland blew in his last extremity, the olifant which the Midi folk say\r\nstill echoes in the Pyrenean gorges:\r\n\r\n    Vient à Burdele la citet de valur,\r\n    Desur l'alter seint Sevrin li barun\r\n    Met l'olifant, plein d'or et de manguns,\r\n    Li pélerin le veient ki là vunt.[222]\r\n\r\n    (Came to Bordeaux the city of great price,\r\n    And on the shrine of Baron St. Seurin,\r\n    The olifant Charles laid, filled full with gold,\r\n    And to this day pilgrims can see it there.)\r\n\r\nThe XX-century pilgrims to the old city on the Garonne must remember\r\nthat the _Chanson de Roland_ was written a long, long time ago, and that\r\nto-day the olifant of the paladin lives only in the pages of French\r\nhistory, where its place is as secure as the standard of Jeanne d'Arc.\r\n_À la peine, à l'honneur._ Without St. Seurin's church we might have\r\nforgotten a proud page of Bordeaux' past.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOULOUSE[223]\r\n\r\n    Ici, dans Toulouse, je sens palpiter\r\n    La prodigieuse histoire du libre Languedoc!\r\n    Et je vois Saint-Sernin, la grande église romane, ...\r\n    Et le rempart où la pierre écrasa l'oiseau de\r\n    Proie que je ne veux pas nommer....\r\n\r\n    À Toulouse vivante, à Toulouse qui chante,\r\n    J'élève mon salut et je dis: Ville sainte!\r\n    Au soleil à jamais épanouis-toi puissante!...\r\n    L'âme du Midi réfugiée en toi,\r\n    Chevaleresque et digne, tu as traversé les âges!\r\n    --Frédéric Mistral, at the _Jeux Floraux_ of Toulouse, 1879.[224]\r\n\r\nIf the influence of both the north and the south is felt at Bordeaux,\r\nthe unadulterated Midi reigns at Toulouse. It is eminently the capital\r\ncity of this fertile Languedoc, where art and luxury developed\r\nprecociously in the earlier periods of the Middle Ages. Here the\r\ntroubadour still sings in the regional tongue which might to-day be the\r\nspeech of France (instead of a dialect) had a genius such as Dante\r\nwritten in the _langue d'oc_, the most gracious form of the Romance\r\nlanguage. It is spoken in Aragon and Catalonia--lands where the\r\narchitectural development followed the same trend as that of French\r\nLanguedoc.\r\n\r\nModern Toulouse is not a handsome city like the Bordeaux of to-day. Its\r\nmost imposing church is not its cathedral of St. Étienne, which is as\r\nungainly outside as it is irregular within. The nave and choir make no\r\npretense of following the same axis line, since they never were intended\r\nto form one edifice; were the north wall of the nave extended down\r\nthrough the choir, it would abut on the high altar.\r\n\r\nThe nave is of enormous span like that of Bordeaux Cathedral. It once\r\nhad side aisles, but the entire width of the edifice was thrown into one\r\nhall when the church was remodeled in 1211. Simon de Montfort (whom\r\nMistral, as a patriotic son of the Midi, refuses even to name in his\r\nverses) was besieging the city while the Angevin vaults of its cathedral\r\nwere building, and Count Raymond VI of Toulouse ordered that the works\r\nshould continue, war or no war.\r\n\r\nThe choir of Toulouse Cathedral belongs to the same current of northern\r\nGothic that produced Clermont, Limoges, and Narbonne. Begun in 1275, it\r\nwas inspired directly by Narbonne Cathedral, whose foundation stone was\r\nlaid in 1273. The plan is of the north, but the feeling is meridional.\r\nAfter the death of the wealthy Bishop Bernard de Lille, the founder, the\r\nchapter had not sufficient funds to continue building on the same\r\nambitious scale. Only in the XV century was the triforium level reached,\r\nand it was not until the XVII century that the masonry roof was added.\r\nEven then it was so skimped that the exterior aspect of the choir is\r\ndeplorable. At St. Étienne there seemed to be a fatality against\r\nsymmetry. When all hope was given up of replacing the Romanesque nave by\r\none of the same character as the choir, it was decided to make its\r\nentrance more important; but instead of setting the new Flamboyant\r\nportal in the center of the west façade, it was placed to one side. The\r\nwindow dedicated to two sons of the Midi, St. Roch and St. Sebastian, is\r\nattributed to Arnaud de Moles who made the celebrated Creation,\r\nprophets, and sibyls of Auch Cathedral. Some of the grisaille in St.\r\nÉtienne came from the Jacobins.\r\n\r\nThere are few church interiors in Europe more stately and unique than\r\nthat of the brick abbatial in Toulouse, called the Jacobins', a name\r\ngiven the Dominicans because their Paris convent was in the rue St.\r\nJacques. The house of wisdom is founded on seven pillars, Scripture\r\ntells us.[225] So the Friars Preachers planted directly down the center\r\nof their lofty hall church seven columnar piers that soar to an enormous\r\nheight. The easternmost one is set in the middle of the apse and on it\r\nfall some fourteen ribs. The vault arches of white stone against the red\r\nbrick infilling are of striking effect. No mediæval pillars--save those\r\nof the late-Gothic church of St. Nicolas-du-Port near Nancy--are higher\r\nthan the seven giants of Toulouse. In the desecration of the edifice\r\nafter the Revolution, its pavement was covered with soil, for the\r\nstabling of horses, but within the last ten years excavations have\r\nexposed the true bases of the piers.\r\n\r\nThe Jacobins' church was founded in 1229 by a rich citizen and his wife,\r\nwho had vowed to devote a large portion of their fortune to God's\r\nservice, should their only daughter recover from a desperate illness.\r\nThe edifice, constructed with an audacious massiveness, as if for\r\neternity, has been allowed to fall into general decay, and now appears\r\nmore desolate than would a ruin of stone. Like alien images, gargoyles\r\nprotrude forlornly from the red brick walls, so inconsistent is brick\r\nwith the true Gothic spirit. The Midi was too wedded to classic\r\ntraditions to excel in the national art, which it never took completely\r\nto its heart. There is little of the ogival style about these narrow\r\nloophole windows, these diagonals unbraced by flying buttresses. Gothic\r\nin the south has an accidental aspect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Jacobins', or Dominicans', Church at Toulouse_\r\n\r\n(_XIII Century_)]\r\n\r\nTo the greatest of Dominican churches the Avignon pope, Urban V, who\r\ncovered the Midi with his monuments, gave the body of St. Thomas\r\nAquinas, greatest of Dominican doctors. It was saved when the Jacobins\r\nwere sacked in 1562, and is now in St. Sernin, whose collection of\r\nauthentic relics is the richest in France--and some say in Europe.\r\n\r\nToulouse also had a Franciscan brick church, whose wall bordered on the\r\ncity ramparts, so that passages of defense were thrown from buttress to\r\nbuttress. That church of the Cordeliers (rich with memories of St.\r\nAnthony of Padua) was burned in 1870, and its lovely XV-century cloister\r\nnow forms part of the Museum that is housed in the former convent of the\r\nAugustinians. The graceful octagonal brick tower of the Cordeliers,[226]\r\nsaved from the wreckage, was modeled on that of the Jacobins', just as\r\nthe Jacobins' tower, in lessening stories, was designed probably by the\r\narchitect who made the top stories of St. Sernin's beacon. Artists have\r\npreferred the Jacobins' belfry to its prototype.\r\n\r\nThe paucity of stone in the province caused the creation of a school of\r\nbrick architecture of which Toulouse was the center. One may prefer a\r\nstone architecture, but one cannot deny the lovely tones of brown and\r\ncrimson madder acquired in time by these brick monuments of the Midi\r\nthat seem created especially for resistance and long duration.\r\n\r\nNot the cathedral of Toulouse, but its monastic brick church of St.\r\nSernin, is the supreme religious monument of the city and the grandest\r\nRomanesque edifice in France. Its date has been discussed by MM. de\r\nLasteyrie, Corroyer, Saint-Paul, and Jules de Lahondès. In the last\r\nquarter of the XI century the monks began the choir of the present\r\nchurch, which combined the characteristics of the Romanesque schools of\r\nBurgundy and Auvergne. Those influences had passed south by way of\r\nConques, where the abbatial of Ste. Foi had been rebuilt a generation\r\nbefore St. Sernin. In 1083 Cluny monks replaced at St. Sernin the canons\r\nregular, and where Cluny reformed, building activities usually followed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Toulouse monastery church was rising, its selfsame plan\r\nappeared in the northeast corner of Spain in the cathedral of Santiago\r\nCompostela, begun in 1082, too direct a copy to have been done by any\r\nbut St. Sernin's own architect or his favorite pupil. In Spain the works\r\nwent faster, so that Santiago Cathedral was completed long before the\r\nabbatial at Toulouse, and, being constructed in stone, its interior has\r\nnot been marred by centuries of whitewashing.\r\n\r\n\"The entry of Urban II into Toulouse\" is pictured by Benjamin Constant\r\nin the Museum. In 1096, on his journey through France, preaching the\r\nFirst Crusade, he blessed the unfinished choir and transept of St.\r\nSernin. The aisles around the transept form the most imposing part of\r\nthe church. As the XI century closed, the transept was continued and the\r\nnave begun under the direction of a monk-builder, St. Raymond Gaynard, a\r\nman of wealth before entering the cloister. He conceived the masterly\r\nplan of five aisles. The side aisles were covered by a quarter-barrel\r\nvaulting that serves the purpose of a continuous flying buttress.\r\nPerhaps it was when the original architect of St. Sernin had proceeded\r\nto Santiago Compostela that St. Raymond became master-of-works at\r\nToulouse. In 1119, a year after his death, another pontiff, Calixtus II,\r\nblessed St. Sernin.\r\n\r\nFrom 1120 to 1140 was made the south portal, which constitutes, with\r\nMoissac's[227] portal and cloister, the chief works extant of the\r\nLanguedoc school of sculpture. That school needs a competent biographer\r\nwho will do for it what M. Paul Vitry has done for the\r\nRegion-of-the-Loire school, and MM. de Vasselot and Koechlin for the\r\nimagery of southern Champagne.[228] The high-water mark of the regions'\r\nsculpture was attained in the Annunciation group at Moissac, whose\r\nethereal elongated figures in clinging draperies rouse the imagination.\r\nThe monks of Moissac, being Cluniac and not Cistercian, found imagery\r\nprofitable to their souls. What were Bernard's thoughts as he gazed at\r\ntheir haunting rendering of the Incarnation?\r\n\r\nPuritan Bernard thundered against the bizarre grotesques carved in\r\ncloisters. Up to 1140 they were popular, since the untrained\r\nstonecutters found it easier to make a caricature than an image true to\r\nnature. The invasions of the Barbarians had wiped out the sculptor's\r\nart, and the men of the XI century had to rediscover it. While St.\r\nBernard sojourned in Toulouse he lived in St. Sernin's monastery, a\r\nCluniac house, and it is probable that he paused with the monks at\r\nMoissac on the memorable journey he made into Languedoc to combat the\r\nfast-spreading dualist heresy of the Catharists. He was accompanied by\r\nBishop Geoffrey de Lèves of Chartres, the builder of the most beautiful\r\ntower in the world. Surely those enlightened men mused with spiritual\r\nbenefit before the _Ecce ancilla Domini_ at Moissac? But one very much\r\ndoubts if Bernard could have approved of four hundred carven capitals in\r\nthe abbatial at Toulouse.\r\n\r\nSlowly the making of St. Sernin's nave advanced. At first it was built\r\nstory by story, but later the more usual procedure of bay by bay was\r\nadopted. In 1217, from the roof of St. Sernin, the stone was thrown that\r\nkilled Simon de Montfort, who was besieging Toulouse. To the end of time\r\na character such as his will rouse both enthusiasm and detestation. His\r\npersonal morals were exemplary, his own troops adored him. The leading\r\nmen of Christendom regarded him as an instrument of Heaven and right\r\nprogress. The Midi execrated him, and does to this day, even as Ireland\r\nexecrates Cromwell, whom good Puritans consider a hero, for the\r\nreligious psychology of those two born leaders was curiously alike. With\r\nGod's name on their lips their troops felt righteous in butchering.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Simon de Montfort the Albigensian wars changed in\r\ncharacter. Simon's son, Amaury de Montfort, was incapable of retaining\r\nthe principality won by his father's sword, so he sensibly passed over\r\nhis claims to the king of France. The struggle henceforth was purely\r\npolitical. Blanche of Castile's wise head solved the Midi tangle when\r\nshe married her son Alphonse of Poitiers to the heiress of the Count of\r\nToulouse, with the understanding that, should the young people die\r\nchildless, Languedoc fell to the French Crown. Alphonse gave the Midi,\r\nsays Molinier, the first intelligent administration it had received\r\nsince the better times of the Roman Empire. When he and his wife died,\r\nreturning from St. Louis' fatal crusade of 1270, the great southern land\r\nbecame a part of France.\r\n\r\nThe Albigensian wars--for with reluctance one calls those years of\r\nbitter strife a crusade--delayed the completion of St. Sernin, whose\r\nmain façade is gaunt and bare, and whose westernmost windows lack stone\r\ncasements. When the Midi came under French rule the monks attained\r\nsufficient prosperity to erect the octagonal tower in five stories--each\r\nof lesser dimensions than the one below it. The upper stories used the\r\nmiter arch so suited to brick. M. Enlart has called attention to the\r\naffinity of the _clochers Toulousans_ and the Lombard steeples. At\r\npresent the underpinning of the tower obstructs the transept-crossing,\r\nbut propping is better than demolition, which is what M. Viollet-le-Duc\r\nproposed in his blind enthusiasm for unity of style. The townspeople\r\nindignantly protested and the supreme beacon of this patroness city of\r\nart was saved.\r\n\r\nA proud boast of Toulouse is that the first Dominican monastery was\r\nestablished there, and by Dominic himself, the saint whom Dante called\r\n\"the messenger and familiar of Christ.\"[229] The Friars Preachers, like\r\nthe Franciscans (who, because of a new appreciation of their founder's\r\ncharacter, are found sympathetic by many who still call a Dominican a\r\n\"bloody sort of monk\"), were agents for the quickening of the religious\r\nfervor of the XIII century. Both Orders were protests against abuses\r\nsuch as luxury, love of gold, and selfish privilege, which feudalism had\r\nhelped to foster in the clergy.\r\n\r\nDominic de Guzman was a Castilian gentleman, a trained scholar, a man\r\nwhose luminous face won instant affection and respect. In the first\r\nyears of the XIII century he came north with the bishop of Osma on a\r\ndiplomatic mission relating to a royal marriage. As those two good men\r\njourneyed through Languedoc amid the fearful havoc wrought by heresy,\r\nthe vocation of the younger priest took shape. Returning from Italy in\r\n1206, he and the bishop of Osma laid aside pomp and comforts to\r\nevangelize according to primitive Christianity. Only too clear was it to\r\nthem that heresy was fed by the unworthy priesthood of the Midi that had\r\nlost the people's esteem. Two generations earlier St. Bernard had\r\nlamented over the same evil. Innocent III rebuked the worldling prelate\r\nof Bordeaux, and asked the bishop of Narbonne if he had a purse in place\r\nof a heart. After ten years' heroic missionizing both before and during\r\nthe Albigensian Crusade, Dominic won papal sanction for his new Order in\r\n1216. He was then a man of forty-seven. When he died, at Bologna in\r\n1221, he left flourishing houses all over Christendom.\r\n\r\nThe function of his Friars was to teach again Christian doctrine in its\r\npurity; hence it was only natural, when the Inquisition[230] was\r\nfounded, after the death of Dominic, that it should be intrusted to such\r\ntrained theologians. They were to be a kind of jury to ascertain whether\r\na case was heretical; if it was so decided, then the civic authorities\r\nstepped in and took action, since heresy was a state offense.\r\n\r\nThe best minds of that day held the theory that the decline of religion\r\nwas a menace to law and order. The violent repression of heresy to\r\nprevent the dissolution of society seemed then as necessary as the\r\nrepression of anarchy seems to-day. It had not always been so. \"Slay\r\nerror, but always love the man who errs,\" was St. Augustine's maxim. St.\r\nAmbrose and St. Hilary reprobated physical violence toward heretics.\r\nGregory VII had protested against the \"impious cruelty\" which had burned\r\na man of Cambrai for heresy. \"Heretics are to be taken by force of\r\narguments, not by force of arms,\" said the vehement St. Bernard himself\r\non one occasion. Gradually a different outlook had taken possession of\r\nmen's minds, a change of view that was to cost the Church dear. Crusades\r\nagainst the infidel were on every side, in the Orient, in the Balkans,\r\nin Spain. When heresy took on so alien and perverse an aspect as the\r\nCatharist errors, which were at root the negation of Christian standards\r\nand a veritable antisocial menace, it needed but an incident to start a\r\ncrusade against heretics in France.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that had the Albigensians won the victory,\r\nthe south of France would have been placed outside the pale of western\r\ncivilization as effectively as was southern Spain under Moslem rule. Had\r\nthe Midi wars been conducted by civil authority many a partisan of\r\nto-day would not hold them up as exceptional horrors, but, since all the\r\nthinking of the Middle Ages was expressed in religious form,\r\nunfortunately the term \"crusade\" was used for the embittered struggle in\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALBIGENSIAN CRUSADE[231]\r\n\r\n     La vérité n'est point a nous, nous n'en sommes que les témoins, les\r\n     défenseurs, et les dépositaires.--MASSILLON.\r\n\r\nSo interwoven is the architectural story of Languedoc with the\r\nAlbigensian Crusade that to find the underlying significance of the\r\nsouthern monuments it is needful to comprehend the trend of thought of\r\nthe Midi people. We have the unbroken testimony of five hundred years as\r\nto what were the tenets of Catharism, the final form taken by the\r\nManichean heresy. They held that two principles, one good and one evil,\r\nruled the universe. In the third century Manes in Persia had woven a\r\ncurious tissue of beliefs, largely Zoroastrian with a tinge of Buddhism,\r\nand had coated it all with a thin veneer of Christianity of the gnostic\r\ntype. The dualist idea and a complete rejection of the Old Testament\r\nwere leading Manichean doctrines. Manes was put to death in Persia, but\r\nhis teachings lingered on in the Orient, and after seven centuries crept\r\ninto Europe by way of the Slav countries of the Balkans. Without a\r\ndoubt, the intercourse of Europe with the Orient, through the crusades,\r\nfostered the gnostic superstitions. The dualist heresy cropped out in\r\nthe north of France, but after the XII century was confined more or less\r\nto Languedoc, where the Visigoths' Arian beliefs had prepared the soil.\r\nFrom the XI to the XIII century these neo-Manicheans were called\r\nCatharists. The local name Albigensian came into usage because in the\r\nregion round Albi, though not especially in that city itself, the new\r\nideas flourished. Toulouse was the heretic's stronghold.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed illogical that many Protestants who revere the\r\nBible should be sympathetic toward the Midi heretics who reprobated the\r\nJehovah of the Old Testament as a vindictive assassin, the creator of\r\nthis the visible world, which is Hell. Life is a nightmare, they taught,\r\nand suicide a virtue. Moses was sorcerer and thief (and the Ten\r\nCommandments?). John the Baptist was a strong incarnation of the Devil\r\nsent to combat the coming Christ. Baptism by water was reprehensible. On\r\nthis muddle of the Old Law was grafted some neo-Christian spiritism.\r\nChrist was the God of good who created the invisible world of spirits.\r\nHe was a phantom being who never really lived on earth or suffered or\r\ndied. The Albigensian denied His human nature. Man's body, living or\r\ndead, was Satan's (Jehovah's) creation and to be annihilated; respectful\r\nburial of the dead was frowned on; marriage was sinful, since to\r\nengender was to capture souls and imprison them in the material world or\r\nHell. Libertinage was preferable to marriage, since it did not pose as\r\nvirtuous. We find in an official recantation of his Albigensian beliefs\r\nby a Midi lord that he promises to accept the Church's tenet that\r\nmarriage is not sinful, as was taught by his sect.\r\n\r\nThe Albigensian heresy was an anti-social peril. It is sophistry to say,\r\nas has Molinier, that we do not know what they taught, or to call their\r\nmovement a step in freeing the human mind, as do certain modern\r\nrationalists. They had two moralities, one for the people, or Hearers,\r\nand a stricter code for the elect, or the Perfect. If a Perfect\r\nrelapsed, he had, after death, to pass through another existence, or\r\nHell, in another body.\r\n\r\nThis current of anti-Christian thought, flowing in from the East,\r\nbrought with it the over-rigid asceticism of the Orient, but in the Midi\r\nfew lived up to ascetic practices. There were minor divergencies in the\r\ntenets according to the different regions, but always, East or West, the\r\nheretics were one in their detestation of the Jehovah of the Old\r\nTestament, and of the Church and her sacraments, especially that of Holy\r\nEucharist. The Church was held to be a prolongation of the abhorred\r\nsynagogue, and, like it, an incarnation of Satan.\r\n\r\nNo one can deny the crying need of reform in the Midi church. But the\r\nAlbigensians damned one half of the Creator's work--the visible\r\nworld--and the perfection which they preached was race suicide. When,\r\nmore recently, Mormonism struck at the root of the social fabric, the\r\nUnited States government took immediate action. Had the Mormons\r\nresisted, had they, for instance, murdered an ambassador from Washington\r\nand war resulted, would we not think that the use of force by the\r\nFederal government was legitimate?\r\n\r\nFrom 1100 to 1208 Rome had sent one peaceful ambassador after another\r\ninto Languedoc. St. Bernard, who was loved all over Europe, was stoned\r\nin the Midi streets. The Albigenses were aggressive wherever they\r\noutnumbered the orthodox, and as most of the Midi lords held the new\r\ntenets, it was the believer who was persecuted in Languedoc. Churches\r\nwere attacked and bishops flung into prison. Because the Count of\r\nBéziers accepted a local council which had censured the heretics, he was\r\nmurdered by the people of Béziers in the very church and on the very\r\nday where they themselves, forty years later, were massacred by the\r\nnortherners. \"On all sides is the image of death,\" wrote the visiting\r\nbishop of Tournai, in 1182, \"villages are in ashes, churches in ruin,\r\nand the inhabitants living like beasts.\" Long before the crusaders\r\narrived in Languedoc life there was a bloody feud, and like ravening\r\nwolves the heretic lords warred one on another; their repeated divorces\r\nwere a flaunted scandal.\r\n\r\nThe Albigensian Crusade is no isolated page in the annals of the Midi.\r\nRead of the anarchy in the south, previous to 1208, and then pass from\r\nthe XIII century to the gigantic duel between France and England in the\r\nHundred Years' War. You will feel no sense of dislocation. The crusade\r\nmethods were hideous, but not exceptional. In the later debacle,\r\nFroissart relates as a matter of course the pleasant little jaunt of the\r\nBlack Prince, _fleur de toute chevalerie_, into Languedoc, in 1355,[232]\r\nwhen he burned some seven thousand houses in the faubourgs of Toulouse,\r\nwhen Carcassonne was twice sacked and burned, Narbonne wrecked, treasure\r\nseized, and all ages and sexes butchered \"till a line of fire and blood\r\nstretched from Toulouse to the sea.\" And the Black Prince was succeeded\r\nby avowed freebooters who gnawed France to the bone, the Grandes\r\nCompagnies who, as said the harassed pontiff at Avignon, _mettaient tout\r\nla Crestienté à combustion_. It was in the dire times of the XIV century\r\nthat the Midi churches fortified themselves.\r\n\r\nWar slackens architectural work in any period. A radical decay of\r\nbuilders' energy in the Midi was not the result of the Albigensian\r\nCrusade, since Languedoc erected its chief Gothic churches between those\r\nwars and the Hundred Years' War, a period, moreover, that was controlled\r\nby the newly functioning Inquisition. To generations torn by anarchy,\r\nthe methods of that tribunal, hateful though they appear to us, were an\r\nadvance in jurisprudence. Every leader of the day accepted them as a\r\nprogress. The civil courts were not to be able, for centuries to come,\r\nto offer even such guaranty for justice. No balanced mind can read the\r\nlives of such chief inquisitors as, for instance, St. Raymond of\r\nPenafort,[233] and fail to comprehend that past history is not to be\r\nread in the light of modern prejudices.\r\n\r\nRome had carried on a hundred years' diplomatic negotiation with the\r\nMidi heretics. Finally, in 1208, the pope's legate was murdered by a\r\nhenchman of the Count of Toulouse and hostilities were precipitated.\r\nInnocent III proclaimed a crusade. Later he regretted its excesses just\r\nas he had cause to deplore the divergence of the Fourth Crusade to\r\nfilibustering purposes, but he was too entirely a man of his own epoch\r\nto regret the Albigensian Crusade itself. By 1209 the northern barons\r\nhad invaded Languedoc and many a building-bishop was in their ranks.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of crusading was at first strong enough to prevent their\r\nattacking the rich trading city of Montpellier which lay in their path\r\nbut which was singularly free of heresy. Yet their very next step was a\r\nsacrilege. The orthodox population of Béziers, when called on to deliver\r\nup their heretic citizens, answered they would sooner see themselves\r\nsunk in the deep sea. It would seem that from the first hour many\r\nCatholics of the Midi looked on the crusade as a war of conquest on the\r\npart of the barons of the north. Between north and south was deep-rooted\r\nantipathy. The more cultivated but more corrupted Midi scorned the\r\nrougher peoples beyond their confines, who in their turn despised the\r\nsoutherners. Inevitable was it that a clash between those opposite\r\ncivilizations should acquire the character of racial hate.\r\n\r\nSimon de Montfort, chosen leader of the crusaders after the sack of\r\nBéziers, soon overran the heretical region, whereupon many barons of\r\nthe north, deeming that the ethical purpose of the Midi excursion was\r\naccomplished, returned to their homes. Henceforth the racial and\r\npolitical aspects of the struggle were accentuated. Cruelty and perfidy\r\nmarked both sides. The Midi lords boasted that no crusader escaped them\r\nwith eyes, fists, or feet, and they cut into little pieces the nephew of\r\nAlbéric de Humbert, archbishop-builder of Rheims Cathedral. In\r\nretaliation Simon de Montfort cut off heretics' ears and noses.\r\n\r\nBy 1212 word was sent to Innocent III that hate and cupidity, as much as\r\nzeal for the Faith, actuated the invaders, whereupon the pope roundly\r\nordered them to pass into Spain to fight Islam. It was too late to stem\r\nthe tide. In 1215, at the Fourth Lateran Council, in which every power\r\nin Christendom, lay and ecclesiastic, had a voice, Simon de Montfort's\r\nretention of his Midi conquests was sanctioned. Simon's death, in 1218,\r\nled young Raymond VII of Toulouse to rise in arms and the wars that\r\nfollowed were frankly political. In 1229 peace was signed under the\r\nportal of Paris Cathedral and the only daughter of Raymond VII affianced\r\nto the brother of the king of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBI CATHEDRAL[234]\r\n\r\n     Laissons-nous aller de bonne foi aux choses qui nous prennent par\r\n     les entrailles et ne cherchons point de raisonnements pour nous\r\n     empêcher d'avoir du plaisir.--MOLIÈRE.\r\n\r\nThe city which gave its name to the terrible episode of the XIII century\r\nlies forty miles east of Toulouse. The local saying is, \"Who has not\r\nseen the cathedral of Albi and the tower of Rodez has seen nothing.\"\r\nAlbi Cathedral yields to none in its gaunt majesty. It stands apart in\r\none's visions of travel, as unique a memorial of past history as the\r\nMount of the Archangel off the coast of Normandy, as Vézelay looking out\r\nover the soft valleys of Burgundy, as Le Puy on its basaltic pinnacles.\r\nNever was a monument more absolutely itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Albi Cathedral (1282-1399). A Midi Fortress Church_]\r\n\r\nUnfrequented Albi was once in the stir of life, and over its stone\r\nbridge, built nine centuries ago, have passed the notable folk of the\r\nMiddle Ages[235] as they wended their way to Santiago Compostela,\r\nwhither all the world was going in those days. Time-scarred houses\r\nborder the reddish Tarn; dark, decayed streets climb the hill. At a\r\ncurve of the river, bastions and ramparts rise in terraces to a\r\nfortified episcopal palace and--crowning all--the enormous bulk of the\r\ncathedral. Its long, stark wall strikes the sky in a formidable straight\r\nline. The west façade is a massive donjon, four hundred feet above the\r\nTarn. No welcoming west portals here, no extended transept arms of\r\nsacrificial mercy, no soaring buttress, no leaping pinnacles. Not the\r\nlore of Christ, \"Do as you would be done by,\" seems to have inspired\r\nAlbi, but the Hebraic spirit of breaking one's enemies' bones, as if the\r\nJehovah of the Old Testament, outraged by Albigensian blasphemies, here\r\nasserted himself in a temple that would forever be a looming menace for\r\nheretics.\r\n\r\nAlbi's forbidding structure rose between those two harsh epochs--the\r\nAlbigensian Crusade and the Hundred Years' War. Its aggressive mass was\r\nplanned by a most aggressive churchman, Bernard, Cardinal de Castanets,\r\nthe city's learned bishop detested of the people as their uncompromising\r\nfeudal master, as well as a spiritual chief so harsh in his\r\ninquisitorial functions that a pontifical commission was appointed, in\r\n1306, to repair his excesses. In 1282 Bernard de Castanets laid the\r\nfirst stone of Albi Cathedral and for twenty years he and the chapter\r\ncontributed a twentieth of their revenues. The church was finished by\r\nthe sixty-fifth bishop, Guillaume de la Voulte, in the last years of the\r\nXIV century.\r\n\r\nTo approach the cathedral at its apse end is not so picturesque as from\r\nthe river side, but it is formidable enough. The prodigious apse rises\r\nabruptly, imperiously, from the town square. One fairly shivers beneath\r\nits Tolosan brick walls, overtowering and overpowering, broken merely by\r\na few narrow windows--surely the narrowest ever made in a Gothic\r\nchurch--and by uniform bastion-tower buttresses. Gargoyles, of as alien\r\nan aspect as those of the Jacobins' at Toulouse, crane their gaunt necks\r\nfrom the upper walls, as if asking what manner of Gothic this is.\r\n\r\nAlbi Cathedral is the meridional interpretation of the national art. The\r\ntraditions of Rome held tenaciously in southern France, where builders\r\ndisliked to show the machinery by which their edifices stood. The\r\nbuttresses at Albi are in larger part hidden within the church under the\r\nguise of walls between the side chapels. The flying buttress is uncommon\r\nin the Midi. Like Rome again, with her preference for an unencumbered\r\nfloor space, Albi's immense interior is unbroken by aisles. The vault's\r\ndiagonals spring over a width of sixty feet--a span unrivaled by any in\r\nthe north. Albi Cathedral is a vast hall three hundred feet long, one\r\nhundred feet high, not high enough for its length, perhaps, but few will\r\nregret having the marvelous frescoed ceiling, \"the missal of St.\r\nCecilia,\" brought nearer to the eye.\r\n\r\nThe tutelary of this fortress-church is the gentle patroness of music.\r\nHalf the fascination of Albi comes from its convincing inconsistencies.\r\nIt would seem that not Cécile--doubly feminine and gracious under her\r\nFrench name--but Michael Archangel with a brandished sword, should guard\r\nthis rugged pile. As if the good people of Albi felt the incongruity,\r\nthey added, long after Bishop de Castanets' day, a southern portal\r\npreceded by a porch, the baldaquin, with all its elaborate Flamboyant\r\ntracery executed in a creamy-white marble in which surely Cécile, saint\r\nthough she was, must have felt a personal satisfaction. An architect of\r\ngenius set that marble porch of Albi against its red time-dulled walls,\r\n'alabaster on corall'; one takes liberties with Chaucer's rime:\r\n\r\n    And southward in a portal on the wall\r\n    Of alabaster white on red corall\r\n    An oratorie riche for to see,\r\n    In honor of the Roman Cicily.\r\n\r\nTo ascend to the marble baldaquin one passes under a fortified\r\nsculptured gateway, erected by the Dominican bishop of Albi, Dominique\r\nde Florence (1392-1410). The marble portal and porch were executed under\r\nBishop Louis I d'Amboise (1472-1502) and his successor, Louis II\r\nd'Amboise (1502-11) his nephew, belonging to an enlightened family all\r\nof whose members excelled in affairs, war, letters, and art, leaving\r\ntheir memorials at Chaumont on the Loire, their feudal seat, at Cluny,\r\nParis, Clermont, Gaillon, and Rouen.\r\n\r\nLouis I d'Amboise also adorned the interior of his cathedral by the\r\nsumptuous screen of white stone that surrounds the choir, leaving a\r\npassageway between it and the side chapels. The rood-loft, or _jubé_ (so\r\ncalled because from its balcony the clerk chanted _Jube Domine dicere_\r\nbefore the gospel), is sculptured with the ermine of Anne of Brittany\r\nand the lilies of France, being made about 1499, when Anne wedded Louis\r\nXII. Bishop Louis at Albi was brother of the king's prime minister,\r\nCardinal Georges d'Amboise.\r\n\r\nOriginally the choir screen of Albi was painted in colors. While the\r\naccessories indicate that the Italian Renaissance was obtaining headway\r\nin France, the images derive from the short, overdraped Franco-Flamand\r\nfigures of Dijon. Perhaps the stonecutters who made Albi's choir wall\r\ncame direct from Cluny, where a late-Gothic chapel, on which had worked\r\nAbbot Jacques d'Amboise, was adorned with prophets and apostles, each\r\nwith his suitable text. On the inner wall of Albi's choir screen are\r\nsculptured homely but charming little angels, and the twelve apostles\r\nholding scrolls inscribed with phrases of the _Crédo_. Old Testament\r\npersonages, who only heralded the Messiah, were not admitted to the\r\n_sanctum sanctorum_; the vestibule was their proper place. Prosper\r\nMérimée called Albi's screen \"a splendid folly before which one is\r\nashamed to be wise.\" Inside and out it is exuberant with sculpture,\r\nthough its extravagant caprices do not stifle a very real religious\r\nfeeling in the images. Such a profusion of delicate ornament led the\r\nmodern critic to suspect that the choir wall was modeled in cement, not\r\nchiseled in stone, but when a Sorbonne geologist analyzed the substance\r\nit was found to be a fine-grained white stone that grows harder with\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEverywhere in St. Cecilia's cathedral is fragile loveliness set side by\r\nside, as an afterthought, with stern forcefulness. Bishop Louis II\r\nd'Amboise brought from Italy a group of artists to paint the panels of\r\nAlbi's cyclopean vaulting, and the work accomplished by those men of\r\nnorthern Italy, from 1509 to 1512, remains the most splendid color\r\ndecoration of the Middle Ages in France. Michael Angelo was painting the\r\nSistine Chapel ceiling in those same years. Languedoc produced another\r\nsuperb array of color, the windows of Auch Cathedral,[236] and we must\r\nnot forget that the greatest of all Renaissance glassworkers, the friar\r\nwho filled Arezzo with glory, was a Midi Frenchman.\r\n\r\nAmid Albi's arabesques the artists from Bologna and Modena inscribed\r\ntheir names, and some young lovers wrote \"Antonia, mia bella,\" and\r\n\"Lucrezia Cantora, bolognesa.\" The frescoes give the genealogy of\r\nChrist. They recall Perugino, Francia, and Pintoriccio. Never was blue\r\nbackground more marvelous--a strong rare hue neither indigo nor Prussian\r\nnor peacock, but a blending of them all in a cerulean depth of\r\ncolor--an art as entirely lost to posterity as the blue background of\r\nSuger's windows. Chemical analysis has busied itself with Albi's\r\nfrescoes, too; but though the blue color of the vault panels was found\r\nto be obtained from the precipitation of salts of copper by carbonate of\r\npotassium, how to produce a similar hue to-day remains unsolved. Over\r\nthe blue background wind lovely arabesques, and the saints portrayed are\r\nstately Italians of the Renaissance. The diagonals and transverse arches\r\nare colored in old-gold. On the western wall of the church a XV-century\r\nfresco was painted directly on the bricks, a Last Judgment copied from\r\npopular woodcuts of the day, with the punishments of the seven deadly\r\nsins pitilessly set forth. The painting was ruthlessly cut into when a\r\nchapel was introduced under the western tower. The side chapels of Ste.\r\nCécile are illuminated in gold and color like a Book of Hours. Never was\r\nthere a church of such contrasts: within--a shrine of warm, polished,\r\nover-splendid beauty, and without--the most rugged feudal challenge of\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARCASSONNE[237]\r\n\r\n     It is the first sharp vision of an unknown town, the first\r\n     immediate vision of a range of hills, that remains forever, and is\r\n     fruitful of joy within the mind ... that is perhaps the chief of\r\n     the fruits of travel.--HILAIRE BELLOC.\r\n\r\nThe Cité of Carcassonne was long one of the most formidable fortresses\r\nof Europe, covering the route from ocean to sea and guarding a pass into\r\nSpain. These Pyrenean provinces of France gave Joffre and Foch to the\r\nWorld War. The lower walls of the Cité were of Rome's building; above\r\ncame the Visigothic defenses; then St. Louis extended the fortifications\r\nand his son completed them.\r\n\r\nWithin its double belt of walls and half a hundred towers is the\r\nprecious little church of St. Nazaire, once of cathedral rank. Its\r\nwestern front was never opened by a portal because it stood near what\r\nwere long the outer ramparts. The Romanesque nave is small and dark,\r\nwithout triforium or clearstory, and with high aisles that buttress the\r\ntunnel vault of the principal span, whose transverse ribs are slightly\r\npointed. Piers and columns alternate. The materials to build this early\r\nchurch were blessed by Urban II in 1096 in the same month that he\r\ndedicated the new choir of St. Sernin at Toulouse. St. Nazaire was an\r\nentirely Romanesque church when Simon de Montfort ruled the Cité for ten\r\nyears. In this church St. Dominic married Amaury de Montfort to a\r\nprincess of Dauphiny. St. Dominic had held a public controversy of eight\r\ndays with the heretics of Carcassonne in 1205, before the coming of the\r\nnorthern barons, and in St. Nazaire he preached the Lent of 1213. Simon\r\nde Montfort was buried temporarily in St. Nazaire, and there exists in a\r\nnave chapel a sculptured stone which some have thought to be part of his\r\nsepulcher, but which is more probably from the tomb of a brother of\r\nCount Raymond of Toulouse, who, having sympathized with the northern\r\nbarons, was slain in consequence. The curious stone shows the engines of\r\nwar described in the _Chanson de la Croisade_, and the costumes of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nUnder Bishop Radulph (1255-66), who built the Gothic chapel beside the\r\nsouth arm of the transept, permission was obtained to replace the\r\nancient transept and choir by a new one. Bishop Radulph won forgiveness\r\nfor those citizens of Carcassonne who were expelled from the fortress in\r\n1262, because they had conspired against the crown with one of the\r\nTrencavel dynasty, their old rulers, and the builders of the Cité's\r\nchâteau. Louis IX, who governed Carcassonne through a seneschal, allowed\r\nthe exiles to start the present town of Carcassonne beyond the river, in\r\nthe plain below the citadel.\r\n\r\nThe erection of the Gothic half of St. Nazaire took place under Bishop\r\nPierre de Roquefort (d. 1321) during the first twenty years of the XIV\r\ncentury. To him we owe the radiant glass lantern which is St. Nazaire's\r\ntransept and choir, a structure that is really a big transept with seven\r\nchapels, equally high, along its eastern wall, the central of which\r\nchapels, and the longest, serving as choir. The windows in the chapels\r\nrise to the roof, and are filled with clear and brilliant glass ranked\r\nwith the best of the XIV century; those in the first two chapels excel\r\nthe others. Two windows show the arms of Pierre de Roquefort. St.\r\nNazaire was one of the last to use the legend-medallion type of window;\r\nhenceforth, in each panel, a single figure was placed in an\r\narchitectural setting.\r\n\r\nThe seven eastern chapels of the transept open one on the other above a\r\nlow dividing wall, and standing out from those walls, so that a narrow\r\npassage is made between them and the transept, are detached piers that\r\nrise powerfully from pavement to vault-springing. Above their capitals\r\nthe molds die away in the column--a very early use of a Flamboyant\r\ncharacteristic. The two pillars flanking the entrance to the choir are\r\ndecorated, midway up, with statues under canopies sculptured by northern\r\nartists before 1320.\r\n\r\nArchæologists declare that the Gothic part of the Cité's ancient\r\ncathedral are the perfection of XIV-century construction, elastic in\r\nevery part, each part fulfilling its own separate function. The ogival\r\nprinciple could not be carried farther. It is thought that some\r\narchitect of the north made the plan, which local masons executed. The\r\nonly Midi trait is the flat, tiled roof.\r\n\r\nModern restoration has overhauled the citadel of Carcassonne too\r\nradically. Imperiously set though it is, does it grip the imagination as\r\nentirely as Aigues-Mortes, lying flat on marsh lands, its time-stained\r\nwalls untouched? Often in France one echoes Pius IX's response to Baron\r\nde Crozé, who proposed the restoration of the Coliseum: \"Dear Son, I\r\nhave read your memoir and I thank you for it; but do you not know that\r\nthere are two sorts of vandalism, one which consists in destroying, the\r\nother in restoring? Never has the Coliseum been so beautiful as in its\r\nmoving contrast of past splendor and magnificent present decay. To\r\nrestore it is to annihilate the work of centuries, to recompose an\r\nordinary pastiche with no _éclat_.\"\r\n\r\nNot that Carcassonne, as redressed by M. Viollet-le-Duc, is deficient in\r\n_éclat_; it has too much of it. It is a vision of a feudal fortress too\r\ncarefully prepared, too deliberately made ready for the tourist.\r\n\r\nIn the lower town are the typically meridional churches of St. Michel,\r\nthe actual cathedral of Carcassonne, and St. Vincent whose aisleless\r\nhall is the widest in the Midi--a span of sixty-eight feet. Even when\r\nusing diagonals, the south kept true to its favorite Romanesque\r\ntraditions. Neither church has a triforium, the apse windows are long\r\nand narrow, over the entrance of each chapel is an eight-lobed rose, and\r\nthe buttresses are disguised as walls between the side chapels. The\r\ntracery is Rayonnant. St. Vincent was built after the Black Prince\r\nburned Carcassonne in 1355. At its sculptured portal was placed a statue\r\nof the newly canonized saint-king, Louis IX, under whom this modern\r\nCarcassonne was founded.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARBONNE CATHEDRAL[238]\r\n\r\n    Que chaque homme console un homme,\r\n    Fasse un bien, donne une pitié,\r\n    Ne t'occupe pas de la somme:\r\n    Ce pain sera multiplié.\r\n    --JEAN AICARD (born in the Midi, 1848).\r\n\r\nAt Narbonne one is at the very heart of the Midi. It is an ancient\r\nmother city of Europe, a capital of Celtic Gaul. Surpassed by nothing\r\nin the Roman world, Narbonne kept its pre-eminence under both pagan and\r\nChristian Rome. It became the seat of the Visigothic royal line, and of\r\ntheir Moorish conquerors. Charlemagne made it a fortified outpost, and\r\nduring the Middle Ages it was the richest of trading centers, a third of\r\nwhose population was Jewish. In 1311, the same covetous king who\r\nabolished the Templars banished the Jews, to whom Charlemagne had given\r\nthe freedom of this town for their support of his cause against Islam.\r\nTo-day one walks its dust-white streets with a strange sensation of\r\nloneliness. Narbonne is a dead city.\r\n\r\nWhen in the latter part of the XIII century the great Gothic cathedral\r\nof St. Just was begun, there seemed no reason why so flourishing a\r\ntrading center could not succeed in the enterprise. Unlike Beauvais,\r\nwhere the chief church was from its inception out of all proportion to\r\nthe population, Narbonne could easily have erected a nave to complete\r\nits mighty choir. In 1272 was laid the first stone of St. Just\r\nCathedral.[239] Then there occurred here what happens to all rivers that\r\ncommunicate with the sea by means of lagoons: gradually the salt lakes\r\nsilt up till they become marshes through which the river winds\r\ntortuously till suddenly it breaks a new path to the sea. In 1320\r\noccurred this catastrophe for Narbonne. The Roman dike gave way and the\r\nriver Aude left its ancient bed, quitting Narbonne to flow toward\r\nCourson, where it still is. The stagnant waters bred disease, and the\r\nmetropolis, greeted by Sidonius Apollinaris for its salubrity, _Salve\r\nNarbo, potens salubritate_, became a pestilential site. Narbonne sank\r\ninto silent decay. Over the shrunken city stands the ghostly fragment of\r\nthe great cathedral, surpassed in height only by Beauvais and Amiens.\r\n\r\nSt. Just was begun in 1272, and three years later the cathedral of\r\nToulouse was started on a plan and with profiles so closely resembling\r\nNarbonne's chief church that one master may have designed both. Both\r\nderive immediately from those northern Gothic churches translated with a\r\nmeridional accent, the cathedrals of Clermont, whose choir was finished\r\nin 1265, and of Limoges, begun in 1273.\r\n\r\nThe Midi shows in Narbonne Cathedral in the simplified triforium which\r\nis framed by wall spaces, as are the clearstory windows, in the\r\nextremely high pier arcades, and in the stout buttresses that are\r\ndisguised as dividing walls between the side chapels. The capitals are\r\nmere uncarved bands, and over them certain molds die away in the pier.\r\nM. Anthyme Saint-Paul's theory was that even in the XIII century began\r\nthe evolution which was to end in Flamboyant Gothic. He pointed out, in\r\nNarbonne's chapels, windows with Rayonnant tracery side by side with\r\nflamelike undulations. M. Enlart thinks we cannot be sure that they were\r\ndone at the same time. An unusual and graceful aspect was achieved in\r\nthe choir's northern aisle by the setting of piers beyond the dividing\r\nwalls of the chapels, making a kind of double aisle like that in the\r\ntransept of St. Nazaire at Carcassonne.\r\n\r\nAn architect named Henri is cited as master-of-works at Gerona Cathedral\r\nwhose chevet, begun after 1312, resembles that of St. Just. Henri was a\r\nname uncommon in the Midi. It is thought that he was the original\r\narchitect of Narbonne. His successor at Gerona, Jacques de Favari or\r\nFavers, a name of the central plateau of France, is known to have\r\ndirected the works of Narbonne's chief church. Catalonia, Aragon, and\r\nLanguedoc were allied in architecture as in tongue. Poblet in Catalonia\r\nis directly the daughter of the abbey at Fontfroide, six miles from\r\nNarbonne.[240] The Gothic influence of Narbonne spread to the isles in\r\nthe Mediterranean, to southern Italy and Cyprus.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Maurin began Narbonne Cathedral after the tragic crusade of\r\nSt. Louis in 1270. He had vowed that if ever again he saw the fair land\r\nof France he would offer thanksgiving by rebuilding his church. The\r\ncorner stone and relics were sent by Pope Clement IV, originally a\r\nlawyer at St. Gilles, and then archbishop of Narbonne, whose crumbling\r\ncathedral of Charlemagne's time he had purposed to replace by a Gothic\r\none, when his translation to the papacy intervened.\r\n\r\nThe apse chapels were built first. The main parts of the choir are the\r\nwork of Archbishop Gilles Aycelin de Montaigu, (1292-1311), a noble of\r\nAuvergne, brother of the bishop who was building Clermont Cathedral and\r\nwho had himself been a canon at Clermont. He also began the cloister,\r\nand to his own residence added a donjon tower. It is thought that the\r\nepiscopal palace at Narbonne served as prototype for the palace of the\r\npopes at Avignon. In modern times, between its ancient towers a town\r\nhall has been constructed. In 1311 Gilles Aycelin was transferred to the\r\nsee of Rouen, and Rouen's archbishop, Bernard de Farges (d. 1341), a\r\nnephew of the pope who built the choir of Bordeaux Cathedral, took his\r\nplace at Narbonne, where he completed the giant choir. Services were\r\nheld in it in 1320.\r\n\r\nThe truncated western end of the cathedral is a depressing sight. Work\r\nstopped after the completion of the east wall of the transept, whose\r\nwindow apertures had later to be filled in; by the XV century all hope\r\nof completing the church was abandoned, and two west towers were raised.\r\nIn the XVIII century the plan to build a nave was revived and part of\r\nthe city ramparts were thrown down to allow for its extension. One bay\r\nof the proposed structure was begun in bastard Gothic, and then the\r\nenterprise collapsed. The present entrance is through a door contrived\r\nin one of the apse chapels. The exterior of that apse was fortified.\r\nFrom one turreted buttress pile to the other was maneuvered a crenelated\r\ngallery, and originally the passage communicated with the bishop's\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nAlthough sadly needing a nave, Narbonne's choir is a proud and noble\r\nvessel. Critics have called it a work of mechanical skill more than of\r\nimagination. Its science is beyond cavil, each thrust being exactly\r\ncounterbutted. Profiles, however are angular and there is a painful lack\r\nof sculpture. If, technically, Narbonne's chief church is somewhat hard\r\nand dry, it has retained sufficient of the emotional quality of Gothic,\r\nwhat has been called its _sursum corda_, to belong to the grand\r\ntradition of the national art. Moreover, one can kneel reverentially on\r\nthe very steps of the altar instead of being kept at a stately distance.\r\nIn the clearstory are the loveliest XIV-century windows in France, like\r\nrare-toned etchings or delicate spider-web, time-stained lace. As there\r\nis color in them, it is inexact to call such windows grisaille, but the\r\nsubdued note of grisaille glass predominates.\r\n\r\nBetween Narbonne and Spain lies Perpignan's XIV-century[241] cathedral,\r\nand Elne's cloister, called a work of supreme elegance by the critical\r\nProsper Merimée, and to the east at Béziers is a fortified cathedral\r\nwith massive towers, begun in 1215 and building through the XIV century;\r\nit has good stained glass of this latter period.\r\n\r\nOne's interest in Béziers centers in the terrible massacre of 1209, the\r\nopening act of the Albigensian Crusade. Not that the mere sacking of a\r\ncity would have roused such horror. In the course of its history eight\r\nmassacres had occurred in Béziers. It was a day when such acts were the\r\naccepted methods of warfare and the northern leaders had discussed\r\nwhether it were not good tactics to start their campaign by\r\nterrorization. It was the slaughtering of the citizens in the churches\r\nto which they had fled for sanctuary that violated the general\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nWitnesses of the sacking of Béziers say that while the chiefs of the\r\nbesieging army were considering how to spare those in the city who were\r\nnot Albigensian, an assault was started through the skirmish of lawless\r\nhangers-on of the crusading army and a few townspeople. In the confusion\r\nthat followed, the northern knights rushed to arms and the city was\r\ncaptured. A XX-century wrecking of the Louvain-Dinant-Termonde type\r\nfollowed, and some twenty thousand perished.\r\n\r\nModern scholars doubt that the famous _Tuez-les-tous_ remark, attributed\r\nto Abbot Arnaud of Cîteaux, who died archbishop of Narbonne, was ever\r\nuttered. He is accused of saying, \"Kill them all, God will know his\r\nown,\" when asked how the orthodox were to be told from the heretics. No\r\ncontemporary chronicle mentions it and Albigensian historians would\r\ncertainly have flung such words at the crusaders; equally would an\r\nardent admirer of Simon de Montfort, who wrote his _Gestes_, have lauded\r\nthe sentiment, if one is to judge by other happenings he thought\r\npraiseworthy. Neither enemy nor friend mentions the _Tuez-les-tous_\r\nphrase. It first occurs in the history of a German monk at Bonn, long\r\nafter the Midi crusade, and the pages of that chronicler are so filled\r\nwith discredited assertions that little he says should be taken\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTPELLIER AND MAGUELONNE[242]\r\n\r\n     The tocsin sounded its lamentable notes of alarm over all the land\r\n     of France. Fire? No. _War._ The voice of the bells long condemned\r\n     to silence by the authorities suddenly rang out everywhere. From\r\n     the high belfries spread the warning, and no one worried now to\r\n     refuse to God, to the Inexplicable, the right of speech. From God's\r\n     house alone came to France, waiting in tense agony, the\r\n     announcement of the most terrible catastrophe that ever fell like\r\n     an avalanche on humanity. Sunrise to sunset from east to west, from\r\n     north to south rang out the coming of War, the world's\r\n     misery.--JEAN AICARD, on how the World War opened in the Midi.[243]\r\n\r\nIn Montpellier is a stately terrace called the Peyrou, built in the\r\nartificial, distinguished style of Louis XIV, from which one looks out\r\non a most lovely landscape of Midi fertility.[244] Here Mistral in 1878\r\nread his vibrant ode to the Latin race, _la race lumineuse, la race\r\napostolique_, and a generation later the people gathered here to listen\r\nto the belfries far and near ring out over that peaceful Claude Lorraine\r\nscene the hour of unity in battle array, for all Frenchmen--Latin and\r\nCelt and Frank. No longer a Midi and a North. The time was past for race\r\nhate or conquest to pose as a crusade. The time had come to end the\r\nsilencing of Christian steeples under the guise of freedom. As one man,\r\nMidi and North sprang up in answer to the tocsin of August, 1914.\r\n\r\nWhat to-day is the cathedral of Montpellier was built from 1364 to 1367\r\nas a monastery church, so that it hardly falls within our scope. But if\r\narchitecturally the city of Montpellier is of lesser importance, it has\r\nbeen for long centuries the intellectual stronghold of the Midi, and we\r\nknow that cathedrals are built with more than stones. Montpellier's\r\nschool of medicine was famous in the XII century. The city was free of\r\nAlbigensian taint; no trading town was more flourishing during the XIII\r\ncentury. At the hour that the northern barons invaded the Midi, the\r\nheiress of Montpellier, whom the king of Aragon married for her dowry\r\nand immediately deserted, gave birth to one who was to build more\r\nchurches than any monarch in Christendom. Twelve candles were set up in\r\nthe chief church of Montpellier, each with the name of an apostle, and\r\nwhen the candle called James burned the longest the child was named\r\nJaime. An inscription on the Tour du Pin, a vestige of the city ramparts\r\nthat originally had twenty-five such towers, records the birth of Jaime\r\nel Conquistador, the scourge of Islam, the conqueror of Valencia and the\r\nBalearic Islands, and the builder of six thousand churches. His father\r\nwas one of the victors of Las Navas de Tolosa, in 1212, where a vital\r\nblow was struck at Moorish domination in Spain; yet he was killed in the\r\nvery next year in Languedoc, fighting on the heretic side.\r\n\r\nPeter of Aragon looked on the Albigensian Crusade as a northern war of\r\nconquest, and if outsiders were to win new lands why had he not the same\r\nright. Jaime's mother fled to Rome, the sole court of arbitration then\r\nin Europe, and when she died there, she left her son the ward of\r\nInnocent III.[245] The pope compelled Simon de Montfort, who held the\r\nchild as hostage, to return him to his Spanish subjects. Jaime's tutor\r\nwas that Languedoc knight, St. Peter Nolasco (d. 1258), who founded the\r\nOrder of Mercy to redeem captives from Moslem prisons, but no\r\nsaint-tutor or saint-neighbor could tame this fierce young eagle, the\r\nscion of the French Midi and the Spanish Pyrenees. From the time he\r\nbuckled on his sword as a boy, to his death in 1276, the weapon never\r\nleft his side. He cut off the ear of the bishop of Gerona who had\r\nrebuked his free living, for Jaime's domestic relations were on a par\r\nwith those of the Languedoc lords and of his Mahommedan neighbors.\r\n\r\nThe church which now is Montpellier's cathedral consists of a modern\r\nchoir of the meridional type, without ambulatory or flying buttresses,\r\nand a nave built as an abbatial by Guillaume de Grimoard, the best of\r\nthe Avignon popes, Urban V. The nave is a wide, unaisled hall, with\r\nsmall clearstory windows. Even when the Midi used diagonals, says M.\r\nEnlart, it remained faithful to Romanesque traditions. At the west\r\nfaçade is an ungainly canopy held up by two round turrets of solid\r\nstone, the sort of thing which is a builder's notion, not the design of\r\nan architect. Urban was disappointed when he found that his architect\r\nfrom Avignon had erected a big chapel rather than a church. When he came\r\nto Montpellier in 1367 the new edifice was almost finished. He was\r\nhonored as never man was before by any city. The townspeople marched out\r\nto meet him, every guild and corporation in the ranks, the lawyers\r\ncarrying the image of the newly canonized St. Yves of Brittany. When the\r\npope's visit ended, half the population walked for miles with him into\r\nthe country, and the town authorities escorted him all the way back to\r\nAvignon.\r\n\r\nUrban V had been educated in Montpellier and he loved its university, in\r\nwhich for years he had taught law in the school where Petrarch studied.\r\nHe renewed the departments of law and art, put new life into the famed\r\nmedical school (which to-day is housed in the former bishop's palace,\r\nfortified with propped machicolations), and founded a college for the\r\nfree maintenance of a certain number of students. To this day\r\nMontpellier reveres him.\r\n\r\nAll over Christendom this energetic Midi baron endowed institutions of\r\nlearning, supported hundreds of students, and built monuments. He\r\nfounded the universities of Prague, Cracow, and Vienna, re-established\r\nthat of Orvieto, made a school of music at Toulouse, began the cathedral\r\nof Mende,[246] near his birthplace, and in Marseilles rebuilt St.\r\nVictor's, where he had been abbot,[247] and where remains his towering\r\ntomb. At Avignon he continued the making of its walls of defense, for it\r\nwas a day when the lawless _Grandes Compagnies_ roved over France.\r\n\r\nUrban was too wise a man not to perceive that his continued residence at\r\nAvignon was a detriment to the papacy, and he made a valiant effort to\r\nreturn to Rome. There, too, he was no sooner established than he\r\ninitiated works of art.[248] Broken by the disorders round him with\r\nwhich he had not strength to cope, he returned to his beloved southern\r\nFrance, where he died almost immediately, in 1370. His successor,\r\nGregory XI, inspired by St. Catherine of Siena, who journeyed to Avignon\r\nin 1376, was to be the pontiff who ended what Italy, sick to death,\r\ncalled \"the Babylonian captivity.\"\r\n\r\nMontpellier was not a bishopric till 1536, when the see was removed from\r\nMaguelonne here, and no sooner was the new see established when the city\r\nwas sacked twice--in 1561 and again in 1565. Every tomb in the present\r\ncathedral was violated. Were its walls lined with those old-time\r\nmemorials they would appear less bare. Neither side was distinguished by\r\namenity in those long years of civil strife.\r\n\r\nMaguelonne, the original bishopric, lies six miles from Montpellier on\r\nthe Mediterranean. In ancient days it was a little island of volcanic\r\nformation, then in time an island in a swamp, connected artificially\r\nwith the mainland. Climb to the flat stone roof of the ancient cathedral\r\nof St. Pierre, almost the only monument left standing here where\r\ncivilization has followed civilization, and look across the lagoons that\r\nlie between France and the solitary dead city. Europe and the present\r\nseem no longer to exist in this the most aloof, self-effaced, most\r\nphilosophic spot in the world.\r\n\r\nMaguelonne had known all the peoples in their pride. During fifteen\r\nhundred years it played its part--Celt, Phoenician, Greek, and Roman\r\nruled here in turn. Visigothic Wamba besieged it. Islam held it under\r\nthe name of Port Saracen till Charles Martel drove the sea robbers from\r\ntheir stronghold by destroying the city; only the new church of St.\r\nPeter was saved. For the following three centuries Maguelonne lay\r\ndeserted. Then in 1037 Bishop Arnaud undertook to restore the city, and\r\nthe cathedral he rebuilt was blessed in 1054. Prosperity soon returned\r\nunder a republican form of government, with the bishop as president.\r\nMaguelonne became an asylum for exiles and a retreat for scholars. Urban\r\nII blessed the island in 1095. When Pope Gelasius II, driven from Rome,\r\nlanded at St. Gilles in 1118, he soon sailed thence for Maguelonne, and\r\nhither came Alexander III in 1162.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. Pierre stood up a very rock of defense against the\r\ncorsairs of Spain and Africa. On its flat stone roof engines of war were\r\nplaced. The present XI-century church replaces that of Charles Martel's\r\nday; over an arm of its transept occurred one of the pre-Gothic early\r\nuses of diagonals. The transverse arches of the nave are slightly\r\npointed. On the lintel of its portal of creamy-white marble--Classic,\r\nSaracenic, Romanesque, and Gothic, with doorjamb bas-reliefs of Peter\r\nand Paul, key and sword--were inscribed by Bernard de Trevies in 1178\r\nsome Latin verses still legible:\r\n\r\n    Ye who seek life's port to gain enter now this sacred fane.\r\n    If ye pass these gates within, ye may break the chains of sin,\r\n    So to pray thou must not fail, all thy cruel sins bewail;\r\n    Know that all thy sins and fears may be washed away in tears.[249]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. Peter was spared in the second annihilation of\r\nMaguelonne, which took place after the religious wars, when Richelieu's\r\npolicy was to level every possible fort that rebellion might use. Stone\r\nby stone the other monuments of the city were carried away. When the\r\ncanal from Cette to Aigues-Mortes was built, in 1708, Maguelonne became\r\na useful quarry. St. Peter's church now stands alone, embalmed as in\r\namber, preaching the sobering lesson, _Sic transit gloria mundi_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIGUES-MORTES[250]\r\n\r\n     Aigues-Mortes! Consonnance d'une désolation incomparable! Dans le\r\n     train si lent à traverser la Camargue je m'imagine ces mornes\r\n     remparts qui depuis sept siècles subsistent intacts. J'évoque ces\r\n     mystérieux Sarrasins, ces légers Barbaresques qui pillaient ces\r\n     côtes et fuaient, insaisis, même par l'histoire. Aigues-Mortes, le\r\n     vieux guerrier qu'ils assaillaient sans trêve, est toujours à son\r\n     poste, étendu sur la plaine, comme un chevalier, les armes à la\r\n     main, est figé en pierre sur son tombeau.--MAURICE BARRÈS.[251]\r\n\r\n\"I propose that we institute a pilgrimage,\" sighed Rodin, \"to all\r\nmonuments _de plein air_ yet spared by restoration.\" Aigues-Mortes' big\r\nquadrangle set on the dead lagoons is precisely as it came from its\r\nbuilder's hand in the reign of Philippe III, son of St. Louis. No\r\ndestructive restoration has ever chipped away the time stain of\r\ncenturies. So shrunken is the little town of to-day, within those\r\nimposing ramparts with their fifteen towers and nine gateways, that it\r\nis as weird an experience to encircle the walls within as to make the\r\nsolitary tour without.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did St. Louis take the crusaders' vow, in 1244, when he began\r\nto look about for a concentration camp on the southern coast. He was\r\nsuzerain only in the south of France. Narbonne had its own counts and so\r\nhad Provence; St. Gilles and Adge were in the Toulouse countship, and\r\nthe Montpellier coast was under Aragon. Practically only swampy\r\nAigues-Mortes was available. St. Louis purchased it from the monks of\r\nPsalmodi, and reconstructed an old tower on the site which had served as\r\na fort during piratical attacks. The grand Tour de Constance, now\r\nstanding outside the quadrangle fortification, is the only part of\r\nAigues-Mortes of Louis IX's day. He deepened the tortuous canal of eight\r\nmiles that led to the sea, since Aigues-Mortes never was directly on the\r\nMediterranean. The Genoese architect, Boccanegra, who constructed the\r\nramparts for Philippe III, followed the type of fortified town in the\r\nOrient; Aigues-Mortes especially resembled Antioch.\r\n\r\nOn both his crusades St. Louis started from his fort on the dead waters.\r\nWhen in 1248 the crusaders saw the low-lying spot so like the\r\npestilential coasts of the East, many a heart felt oppressed. Again in\r\n1270 the king's army arrived at Aigues-Mortes. Finding his transport\r\nships delayed, Louis IX thought it best to move his warriors to the more\r\nhealthful site of St. Gilles. There he held brilliant court, to keep up\r\nthe idle army's spirit, and at the tourneys excelled his Provençal\r\nqueen's nephew, the future king of England, Edward I. The crusaders left\r\ntheir mark on the walls of St. Gilles.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. GILLES[252]\r\n\r\n    Noms des Morts pour la Patrie,\r\n                Qu'on vous trie\r\n    Selons vos provinces; puis,\r\n    Pour propager votre culte,\r\n                Qu'on vous sculpte\r\n    Sur la borne et sur le puits!...\r\n\r\n    Mais d'abord, que votre zèle\r\n                Vous cisèle\r\n    Sur les maisons mêmes d'où\r\n    Pour aller vers le martyre,\r\n                Ils partirent\r\n    Dans le soleil du mois d'août.\r\n\r\n... On lira sur la corniche\r\n                Pauvre ou riche:\r\n    \"_Mort pour nous ... un tel ... un tel...._\"\r\n    Trois fois, tous bas, comme on prie,\r\n                On s'écrie:\r\n    \"_Morts pour nous ... pour nous ... pour nous!_\"\r\n    --EDMOND ROSTAND (1868-1918; born in Marseilles).[253]\r\n\r\nTo this day on the stones of St. Gilles' abbatial are the graffiti of\r\nships and warriors--a king among them--scratched by the swords of St.\r\nLouis' crusaders before they crossed to their death in Africa, 1270. The\r\nsadly dilapidated bourg which is St. Gilles to-day played a prominent\r\npart in the important centuries of the Middle Ages. Many were the popes\r\nand kings who visited it to venerate the tomb of the VIII-century\r\nhermit, Ægidius, from Athens, whose cult was widely spread over western\r\nChristendom, as many a church image and window showing the holy man and\r\nhis fawn remain to tell.\r\n\r\nThe counts of Toulouse were the chief patrons of the abbey. On the First\r\nCrusade, Raymond IV of Toulouse bore the title Count of St. Gilles.\r\nRaymond VI held here, in 1208, an interview with the papal legate, Guy\r\nde Castelnau, the after-consequences of which precipitated the\r\nAlbigensian wars. Angry words were uttered by the count when the legate\r\nrebuked him for shielding the heretics, and the next day the legate was\r\nmurdered by one of the count's retainers as he was about to cross the\r\nRhone. Thereupon Innocent III declared the Albigensian Crusade. In the\r\nfollowing year Raymond VI performed penance before the church door of\r\nSt. Gilles--the last public canonical penance of the Middle Ages. The\r\ndisasters of the house of Toulouse diminished the abbey's building\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nThe discussions over the date of St. Gilles have been of importance\r\nbecause of its relation to the school of Provençal sculpture of which\r\nthe most notable monument is its triple portal. Before St. Gilles'\r\nwestern end is a mass of composite imagery, of different dates and\r\nmaterial, yet composing an architectural unit. Six bays of the nave are\r\ncovered by a masonry roof of the XVIII century; only the piers and side\r\nwalls of the edifice are ancient. Beyond the nave lie the ruins of the\r\nchoir, in which has been installed an open-air archæological museum.\r\n\r\nDid the choir of St. Gilles still stand, it would be the best Gothic\r\nmonument in the south of France, exceptional in possessing an ambulatory\r\nand radiating chapels. At its entrance still exists a spiral staircase,\r\nthe _vis de St. Gilles_, the first of its kind constructed, which many a\r\nmason of the Middle Ages journeyed hither to see. The steps compose an\r\nannular vault, winding like a corkscrew.\r\n\r\nAccording to M. Labande, the choir of St. Gilles was built from 1140 to\r\n1175, and at first there was no intention of vaulting it with diagonals.\r\nAs the walls rose, however, a Gothic vault was prepared for. The nave,\r\nwhose capitals have well-cut acanthus leaves, was erected from 1175 to\r\n1209. It could not have been finished when in 1265 Clement IV rebuked\r\nhis fellow citizens of St. Gilles for their delay in completing their\r\nchurch. Clement had been a local lawyer--a Romanesque house is still\r\npointed out as his--by name, Guy Fouquet, or Fulcodi. The death of his\r\nwife caused him to embrace religion. When raised to St. Peter's chair,\r\nsuch was his dread of nepotism that he wrote to his daughters they were\r\nnot to expect matches any more important than if he were a simple\r\nknight; we learn that the well-admonished young ladies failed to obtain\r\nany husbands at all. This pope, whom St. Louis called \"_notre aimé et\r\nféal Guy_,\" instigated the crusade of 1270, which was associated in the\r\nhour of its departure with his own town.\r\n\r\nDespite his exhortation, St. Gilles' choir was joined to its nave only\r\nin the XIV century, as is proved by the rows of Rayonnant Gothic foliage\r\non the capital of the nave's easternmost bay. The XVI-century religious\r\nwars devastated the abbey, which now was held by Calvinists, now by\r\nCatholics; and finally the Huguenots, after using the church as a\r\ncitadel, ordered that it be razed. The tower was mined and its fall\r\nwrecked all around it, but the arrival of the king's troops saved the\r\nedifice from entire destruction; as the masonry roof had collapsed, a\r\nbastard-Gothic restoration of the nave was undertaken from 1650 to 1670.\r\nThen came the Revolution; the choir was sold and its stones carted away.\r\nSo dead seemed all appreciation of the national art that the\r\nconstitutional curé of St. Gilles clamored for the demolition of the\r\nfamous triple portal, as its images \"were insupportable reminders of\r\npast servitude, recalling the odious feudal régime, displeasing to\r\nlovers of liberty and equality.\" Till the middle of the XIX century the\r\nchurch was abandoned.\r\n\r\nDuring excavations in 1765 a chamber, or bay, of rough workmanship was\r\nunearthed in the crypt, and in it was found a tomb inscribed as that of\r\nSt. Gilles. This is all that remains of the church in which Urban II\r\nblessed an altar in 1096. On a buttress of the crypt an inscription\r\nstates that its foundation was laid Easter Monday of 1116. The abbey had\r\nbeen damaged by an irate count of Toulouse, and Calixtus II asked Peter\r\nthe Venerable to send from Cluny a new abbot to reorganize things.\r\n\r\nThe crypt's north and west walls rose first, but the work was dropped\r\nand taken up several times. All the vaulting, whether groin or\r\ndiagonals, was an afterthought, for all the piers have been rearranged\r\nfor the masonry roof they now support. Only a few of the westernmost\r\nbays of the crypt used diagonals, and as their profiles are the same as\r\nthose in the choir, building from 1140 onward, they are probably\r\ncontemporary. Inscriptions on the outer west wall of the crypt prove\r\nthat in 1142 people were buried there, which would indicate that the\r\npresent stair to the west portal was not yet arranged. Perhaps for a\r\ntime they were not sure of making an upper church above the spacious\r\nbasement. By 1209 that upper nave was built, because Innocent III buried\r\nhis murdered ambassador beside the tomb of St. Gilles, and when Raymond\r\nVI had performed public penance before the portal, we are told that he\r\nwas brushed against by the crowd, and escaped through the lower church,\r\npassing his victim's new tomb.\r\n\r\nThe imaged portal of St. Gilles, which inspired the porch of Trinity\r\nChurch, Boston, is a composite mass of imagery begun in the XII century\r\nand continued till St. Louis' day. Pilfered fragments were made use of,\r\nas was only natural in a region where Rome had left many monuments. Some\r\nof the pillars are the fluted marbles of antiquity; others are of\r\ngranite. Fourteen columns and fourteen large images of apostles and\r\nangels give unity to the composition, as does the continuous wide\r\nfrieze.\r\n\r\nSt. Gilles' images, strong and short like the figures on the Gallo-Roman\r\nsarcophagi near the mouth of the Rhone, are perfectly proportioned to\r\nthe place they occupy, cold, impersonal figures, more architectural than\r\nsculptural, the fruit of an old art, not the beginning of a new\r\ntradition, as was the theory of Herr Vöge, who would trace to Provence\r\nthe origin of French Gothic sculpture. M. de Lasteyrie contended that\r\nthe Porte Royale at Chartres--first of the Gothic portals, last of the\r\nRomanesque--with its long, slender figures in whose visages expression\r\nhas been attempted, descends from the imaged portals of Burgundy, not\r\nfrom St. Gilles or St. Trophime, but from a nascent rather than a dying\r\nart tradition. The Lombard school gave to St. Gilles its lion\r\ncaryatides, a very popular feature at church doors; Lanfranco, who\r\nremade Modena's cathedral in 1099, had been the first to plant pillars\r\non the backs of lions, perhaps copying some lost work of antiquity.\r\n\r\n\"A world in itself,\" said Prosper Merimée of St. Gilles' sculptured\r\nportal. Under the biblical scenes of the frieze animals crouch and\r\ncrawl. Some of the frieze groups, such as the Flagellation, are full of\r\nspirit, and must be of later date than certain other stiff archaic\r\nfigures. The Kiss of Judas with its grimacing soldiers is probably a\r\nXVII-century restoration. The only time that the Expulsion from the\r\nTemple was treated in the older work was here. The sisters Martha and\r\nMary and their brother Lazarus, with Mary Jacobi and Mary Salome, are\r\nall imaged at St. Gilles' door. The tradition of their arrival in\r\nProvence was gaining in favor every day while this portico was making.\r\n\r\nThe savants inform us, though not patriotic Provençal savants, that no\r\nmention of the saints of Bethany is to be found in Provence before the\r\nmiddle of the XI century. Monseigneur Duchesne of the Institute of\r\nFrance, who takes saints out of their niches as boldly as any\r\nBollandist, tells us that it was the monks of Vézelay in Burgundy who\r\nfirst imagined the arrival in southern France of Mary Magdalene, in\r\norder to explain how it was they possessed her relics, the lodestar of\r\ntheir pilgrim shrine. Then, gradually, the legend grew till it was a\r\nremarkably full boatload that landed, in A.D. 40, at Les\r\nSaintes-Maries,[254] where the Little Rhone, on which stands St.\r\nGilles, enters the Mediterranean: the risen Lazarus, whose relics were\r\nclaimed by Autun in 1144; Martha, whose relics appeared at Tarascon in\r\n1187 and caused a new church there to rise;[255] Marcella, the waiting\r\nwoman of Martha and Mary; Maximinus, one of Our Lord's disciples; Simon\r\nthe leper; St. Sidonius; Joseph of Aramathea; and the Blessed Virgin's\r\nsisters, Mary Jacobi, mother of James the Less, and Mary Salome, mother\r\nof James and John, and their dark handmaiden Sara, who became the\r\npatroness of gypsies.\r\n\r\nMonseigneur Duchesne says that a grotto dedicated to the Virgin in the\r\nmountains east of Marseilles came to be regarded, by gradual unconscious\r\nfabrication, as the Sainte Baume where Mary Magdalene passed years of\r\npenitence, for the Midi wove the story of St. Mary the Egyptian with the\r\nsaint of Bethany. All these holy people who had known the Lord fled from\r\nSyria after the martyrdom of St. Stephen and found asylum in southern\r\nFrance. The savants can prove what they will; while in Provence, in the\r\n\"kingdom of sentiment,\" one believes every word of it. Read Mistral's\r\n_Mireille_ and dare to be a skeptic! Under the leaden skies of Paris you\r\nmay take the Institute's learning seriously. But gazing at _la grand\r\nbleu_, the frequented highway between Syria and Gaul when Roman Emperors\r\nruled both, you say to yourself that it all _could_ have happened. For\r\nhundreds of years the people of Provence have been made better and\r\nhappier because they have believed that the historic family of Bethany\r\nwho entertained the Lord were entertained by them.\r\n\r\n\r\nST. TROPHIME AT ARLES[256]\r\n\r\n    Seigneur, des lois et voies\r\n    antiques, nous avions\r\n    quitté; l'austérité, vertus,\r\n    coutumes domestiques,\r\n    nous avions tout détruit,\r\n    démoli....\r\n\r\n    Seigneur, nous sommes tes\r\n    enfants prodigues; mais\r\n    nous sommes tes vieux\r\n    chrétiens: que ta justice\r\n    nous châtie, mais au trépas,\r\n    ne nous laisse point....\r\n\r\n    Seigneur, au nom des pauvres\r\n    gens, au nom des forts, au\r\n    nom des morts--qui auront\r\n    péri pour la patrie, pour leur\r\n    devoir, et pour leur foi!...\r\n\r\n    Seigneur, pour tant d'aversités,\r\n    de massacres, d'incendies;\r\n    pour tant de deuil sur notre\r\n    France, pour tant d'affronts\r\n    sur notre front,\r\n\r\n    Seigneur, désarme ta justice!\r\n    Jette un regard par ici-bas;\r\n    et enfin écoute les cris\r\n    de meurtris et des blessés!...\r\n\r\n    Seigneur, nous voulons devenir\r\n    des hommes; en liberté--\r\n    tu peux nous mettre!\r\n    Gallo-Romans et fils de noble\r\n    race, nous marchons droit\r\n    dans notre pays.\r\n    --(Literal French translation of Mistral's \"Psaume de la pénitence,\" 1870.)\r\n\r\nThe western portal of the cathedral at Arles, less carefully executed\r\nthan that at St. Gilles, was begun at the end of the XII century and\r\nfinished in a couple of generations. Both were inspired by the same\r\nlocal classic influences of Rome and the subsequent Gallo-Roman\r\ndevelopment. The large statues, eminently architectural, at the famous\r\ndoor of St. Trophime, are as sturdy and squat as the images on early\r\nChristian tombs. Two of those ancient tombs, of the V and VI centuries,\r\nhave been turned to ecclesiastic usage in this very church, as baptismal\r\nfont and altar, and across the square from the cathedral many others can\r\nbe studied in the Museum of Arles. The strong Byzantine influences\r\napparent in St. Trophime's sculpture recall that Arles was the favorite\r\nresidence of Constantine. From northern Italy came the animal-caryatides\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nSt. Trophime's Romanesque entrance leads into a somber church under\r\nwhose barrel vault reigns a mellow gloom.[257] Begun before the middle\r\nof the XI century, it was reconstructed in the XII century; the\r\npainfully narrow high side aisles are covered by quarter circles that\r\nbuttress the central vessel, whose undergirding arches are slightly\r\npointed because the pre-Gothic masons had learned that the thrust of a\r\nbroken arch was less. The XV century built the insignificant choir\r\n(without the vestige of a capital), exceptional only in having the sole\r\nambulatory and radiating chapels in Provence. A prelate of the Grignan\r\nfamily built a chapel projecting from the transept, for, not far away,\r\nin Dauphiny, is the château of Grignan, where Madame de Sévigné died\r\nwhile staying with her daughter; one knows that she and XIII-century\r\nBlanche of Castile had been friendly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Mediæval Cloister of Arles_]\r\n\r\nSt. Trophime's cloister, among the most beautiful in France, building\r\nfrom the XII to the end of the XIV century, is the fairest Christian\r\nmonument of Arles.[258] This Midi art expands in the sunlight and\r\ngrows melancholy under a masonry roof. Arles was a free town when it was\r\nbegun, with its own podesta and consuls like a flourishing commercial\r\ncity in Italy. About 1150, the north gallery was commenced, and the one\r\nto the east soon followed. The angle pier is composite (c. 1180), with\r\nSt. Trophimus standing between St. John and St. Peter, the latter being\r\nsculptured in marble. The storied capitals of the cloister are\r\nexceedingly interesting. In the second half of the XIV century the west\r\nwalk was begun, and almost immediately was followed by the south\r\ngallery, which is similar to it save for slight details. The cloister\r\nwas completed under Bishop Jean de Rochechouart (1390-98).\r\n\r\nArles, like Lyons, claims a direct apostolic origin. A tradition says\r\nthat St. Trophimus, her first bishop, was the disciple of the gentile of\r\nEphesus, whom St. Paul mentioned in his epistle to Timothy. For\r\ncenturies before the popularity of the Saints of Bethany legends in the\r\nMidi, St. Trophimus was revered. Pope Zosimus, in the V century, called\r\nArles \"the source from which flowed all over Gaul the rivulets of the\r\nFaith.\" Gregory of Tours voiced another tradition concerning St.\r\nTrophimus when he named him as one of the seven evangelists sent by Pope\r\nFabian into Gaul in 250. At any rate, whether he lived in the first\r\ncentury or the third, St. Trophimus was the first bishop of Arles, and\r\nit is right that its primate church should be dedicated to him.\r\n\r\nArles, from which flowed over Gaul the rivulets of the Faith, is a city\r\nof ruins, and yet most gracious in aspect; _Arles la blanc_, Joinville\r\ncalled it as he sailed by on his way to the Sixth Crusade; _Arles la\r\nGrecque_. The women walk as nobly as the matrons of antiquity here where\r\n\"the copper coins of Rome's republic and the gold of the emperors gleam\r\nin the sun amid the springtime wheat.\" \"I tell you, and you can well\r\nbelieve me,\" sings Mistral, \"that the damsel of whom I speak is a queen,\r\nfor, know you, she is twenty years old and she is Arlésienne.... She\r\ndescended with lowered eyes the steps of St. Trophime, and the stone\r\nsaints by the portal blessed her as she passed, for she was ineffably\r\ngood.\" There are books so typical of their race, or this period, that\r\nthey belong to all time, and by them posterity can learn more of the\r\nbasic forces that build monuments than from many a learned treatise.\r\nSuch a book is Voragine's _Golden Legend_, such a book is the\r\n_Rationale_ of Durandus. The _Barzas-Breiz_ teaches us to comprehend\r\nCarnac and the Calvaries of Brittany. Even so the soul of Provence has\r\nbeen interpreted by her own Mistral, who loved \"the perfume of the\r\nancient days when on the banks of the Rhone flourished a refined\r\ncivilization that for a time bore the name, the Kingdom of Arles, but\r\nthat really, through all the successive revolutions, was naught else but\r\nthe direct survival, on French soil, of Rome's civilization.\"[259]\r\n\r\n\r\nST. MAXIMIN[260]\r\n\r\n     The cement, without which there can be no stability of the walls,\r\n     is made of lime, sand, and water. The lime is fervent charity which\r\n     joineth to itself the sand--that is, undertakings for the temporal\r\n     welfare of our brethren. Now the lime and the sand are bound\r\n     together in the wall by an admixture of water. Water is the emblem\r\n     of the Spirit. And as without cement the stones cannot cohere, so\r\n     neither can man be built up in the heavenly Jerusalem without that\r\n     charity which the Holy Ghost worketh in them. The stones are built\r\n     by the hands of the Great Workman into an abiding place in the\r\n     Church: whereof some are borne and bear nothing, as the weaker\r\n     members; some are both borne and bear, as those of moderate\r\n     strength; and some bear and are borne of none save Christ the\r\n     Corner Stone. All are bound together by one spirit of Charity as\r\n     though fastened with cement, and these living stones are put\r\n     together in the bonds of peace.\r\n\r\n    --BISHOP GUILLAUME DURANDUS of Mende (1220-96), _Rationale_.[261]\r\n\r\nThe bourg and church of St. Maximin lie about thirty miles east of\r\nAix-en-Provence. Some rich Gallo-Roman noble of the V or VI century had\r\nhis estate here, thinks Monseigneur Duchesne, on which he built a\r\nfunereal chapel and crypt according to custom. That crypt with its early\r\nChristian sarcophagi is now under the church of St. Maximin, though why\r\nthat saint is honored in the locality is not known. The first record of\r\nthe site occurred when the estate was passed over to the monks of St.\r\nVictor's at Marseilles, who built a priory here (1038), and chose\r\nMaximinus as its tutelary. It was only when some fertile brain, in\r\nVézelay, said that St. Maximinus was one of the Lord's seventy-two\r\ndisciples, and had accompanied Mary Magdalene to Provence, that\r\nAix-en-Provence began to claim him as her first bishop. For two\r\ncenturies Provence allowed Vézelay to boast of the possession of the\r\nBlessed Magdalene's remains. During Saracen inroads she had lost the\r\nrelics of Lazarus and his sister, so the Burgundian church told her.\r\nFinally--we are quoting Monseigneur Duchesne, not a Midi savant--a\r\npatriotic Provençal whose mind was as fertile in inventions as the\r\nchronicler at Vézelay, arranged a rediscovery in 1279, in the crypt of\r\nSt. Maximin, of the Magdalene's relics, whereupon the pilgrimages to\r\nVézelay ceased.\r\n\r\nBefore witnesses and the ruler of Provence, Charles II d'Anjou (nephew\r\nof St. Louis), was opened one of the sculptured tombs in the Gallo-Roman\r\nnoble's funeral crypt now under the nave of St. Maximin. In the\r\nsarcophagus was found a manuscript, in a wooden coffer, relating that in\r\nthe year of the Incarnation, 716, on December 6th, under King Odoin, the\r\nbody of Mary Magdalene had been moved from its alabaster tomb, in this\r\nsame crypt, to the plainer tomb of St. Sidonius, in order to save it\r\nfrom those felons, the Saracens. The uncritical mind of the age accepted\r\nthe obvious forgery as genuine. It was worded in XIII-century, not\r\nVIII-century Latin, the use of the term Incarnation for dating was an\r\nanachronism, and no such king as Odoin ever existed. Why should it have\r\nbeen expected that Saracens would spare one tomb more than the other,\r\nasks the courageous Monseigneur Duchesne. But why feel too critical of\r\nthe pious fraud, since the genuine enthusiasm it aroused led to the\r\nbuilding of the most imposing Gothic church in Provence and the one most\r\npure in style, an edifice that inspired the imposing modern church of\r\nSt. Vincent de Paul at Marseilles.\r\n\r\nIn 1295 Charles II d'Anjou[262] (1285-1309) began St. Maximin, which he\r\npassed into the care of the Dominicans. Abbé Albanès has discovered that\r\nthe architect's name was Jean Bandier. During two centuries the Angevin\r\nrulers of Provence continued the church, and good King René finished it\r\nbefore he died in 1480. As the first plans were adhered to, the edifice\r\npossesses unity save for a few Flamboyant windows in the aisles. Those\r\nside aisles of St. Maximin are almost as high as the central vessel;\r\nthey braced the main span and did away with the need of flying\r\nbuttresses. Traits of Midi Gothic are the exceedingly narrow windows,\r\nthe lack of a triforium, and uncut bands for capitals, though the\r\nomission of sculpture may be due to the fact that the abbatial belonged\r\nto a mendicant Order, vowed to poverty. St. Maximin's piers soar\r\nmajestically from pavement to vault springing, nor has nobility of\r\nproportion been sacrificed in its severe granite interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIX-EN-PROVENCE[263]\r\n\r\n     Le désordre des malheureux est toujours le crime de la dûreté des\r\n     riches.--VAUVENARGUES (1715--47; born in Aix-en-Provence).\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. Sauveur is a composite edifice needing skilled\r\narchæologists to decipher it. Its semicircular apse, without ambulatory\r\nor chapels, was begun by Bishop Rostan de Noves. Its nave, of the XIV\r\ncentury (with typical capitals whose foliage is disposed in two bands),\r\nshows vestiges of a far more ancient church. The nave's north aisle is\r\nneo-classic. The south aisle, called _Corpus Domini_, is Romanesque, and\r\nwas held to be the ancient cathedral, since it conforms to the classic\r\ntype of the regional Romanesque school, such as the Dom at Avignon.\r\n\r\nM. Labande has demonstrated that this pre-Gothic portion of Aix\r\nCathedral was originally a church for the laity, built between 1150 and\r\n1180 and dedicated to St. Maximinus, and that it was planted along the\r\nside of a church for the canons, dedicated to Notre Dame in 1108.\r\nVestiges of this latter church are the ancient parts in the actual nave\r\nof St. Sauveur.\r\n\r\nThe _Corpus Domini_ has its own sculptured doorway, and three bays\r\ncovered by a barrel vault carried on pointed arches. Over the fourth bay\r\nis a shallow cupola ridged with eight pilasters in a manner inherited\r\nfrom ancient Rome. Classic, too, are the columns now arranged to form a\r\nbaptistry.\r\n\r\nAix was the capital in Provence of the art-loving Anjou princes of the\r\nCapetian line. Under them in 1476 was begun St. Sauveur's beautifully\r\nrestrained Flamboyant Gothic façade and tower. In the nave is a stone\r\nreredos of 1470 called the Tarasque, from the dragon of St. Martha\r\nrepresented in it, and under King René's inspiration was made the\r\nsplendid triptych of the Burning Bush by the French _primitif_, Nicolas\r\nFroment, born in Avignon, but impregnated with the Flemish spirit of Van\r\nEyck. King René kneels in one panel, and his second wife, Jeanne de\r\nLaval, in the other; the outer side of the folding panels is painted in\r\ngrisaille. The Burning Bush was taken as a symbol of the Virgin's\r\nintegrity. The carved doors at the west entrance of St. Sauveur, rich\r\nwith prophets and sibyls, are ranked with the noted doors of Beauvais\r\nand Rouen.\r\n\r\nWhile the church of St. Maximinus, or the present south aisle of St.\r\nSauveur, was building, a student at the University of Aix, across the\r\nway from its cathedral, was St. Jean de Matha (1156-1213), one of those\r\ngood men of history who accomplished a great work but are overlooked by\r\nposterity. In Aix he passed his leisure waiting on the poverty-stricken\r\nsick. Then he went up to the Paris schools to perfect himself in\r\ntheology, and good Bishop Maurice de Sully, then building Notre Dame,\r\nbecame interested in him, and with the prior of St. Victor's, after\r\nattending the young Midi noble's first Mass, prophesied that this was a\r\nsoul chosen of God. Because Jean de Matha had been born in the south, a\r\nwitness of Islam's piracies, he vowed himself at his first Mass to the\r\nredemption of Christian captives. His fellow student at Paris, Innocent\r\nIII, approved the new Trinitarian Order called popularly Maturins\r\nbecause their Paris house was dedicated to St. Maturin. So rapidly did\r\nit spread that before long it had fifty houses in far-off Ireland, and\r\nas many in England. In its annals are the names of all the western\r\nnations. Jean de Matha, until his death, passed backward and forward to\r\nAfrica. When the first boatload of redeemed captives landed at\r\nMarseilles a cry of thanksgiving rose in Christendom. Sometimes a\r\nbrother of the Order would remain in a captive's place, when his funds\r\nfor ransoming prisoners gave out. In Granada, Maturins were martyred. In\r\nthe year 1260 five thousand Christians were redeemed from Islam prisons\r\nby these devoted men. And for five centuries the good work went on, so\r\nthat we hear of Trinitarians freeing Christians from Mohammedans in the\r\nreign of Louis XIV. Cervantes was released from African captivity by the\r\nsons of St. Jean de Matha, else we would have no _Don Quixote_. All\r\nthrough the dark episodes of the Albigensian wars these lives of\r\nunobtrusive Christian charity endured. Their deeds have not been\r\ntrumpeted to the winds. I dare say the historian who rings the changes\r\non the _Tuez-les-tous_ phrase never heard of St. Jean and his Maturins.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVIGNON[264]\r\n\r\n     In abandoning Rome, their cradle, in departing from the venerated\r\n     tomb of the Prince of the Apostle, in ceasing to reign on the site\r\n     consecrated by the blood of martyrs, the popes failed to value the\r\n     prop those august memories were for them. In their voluntary exile\r\n     on the banks of the Rhone the popes were controlled by the king of\r\n     France. Villeneuve's high towers, a French stronghold, threw too\r\n     protective a shadow over the papal palace of Avignon.--L.\r\n     SALEMBIER.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally Avignon does not fit into our category, but who can\r\nclose a chapter on the Midi and not mention, among gems, this diamond?\r\nThere is no more imposing, no more magnificent a palace in the world\r\nthan that of the XIV-century popes at Avignon.\r\n\r\nRomanesque architecture is represented by the Dom and the bridge built\r\nby _frères-pontifes_ over the Rhone (1177-85) under the inspiration of\r\nthe shepherd boy St. Bénézet. Many a time has the river carried away its\r\nbays. The chapel on the bridge shows the work of three epochs, part\r\nbeing of Little Benedict's time, part of 1234, and an apse of 1513.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame-des-Dom, as it was first built, belonged to the usual type of\r\na Midi Romanesque church (1140-60), but to it have been added chapels\r\nand neo-classic decorations.[265] The west porch of the cathedral can\r\nclaim to be one of the first conscious revivals of classic art in\r\nFrance, inspired by a Roman triumphal arch in neighboring Carpentras.\r\nOriginally the inner walls of the porch were frescoed by Simone Martini\r\nof Siena, a friend of Petrarch. That humanist spent many years in\r\nAvignon, and it was at the door of the church of St. Clara that he first\r\nsaw Laura, in 1327. If the Avignon popes employed Italian painters,\r\ntheir architects and sculptors were mainly local.\r\n\r\nAvignon's great day was under the seven Roman pontiffs who lived here in\r\nsuccession during sixty-eight years, a period disastrous to the\r\ninterests and prestige of the Church, but fecund for the art life of\r\nsouthern France. All seven of the popes were meridionals.\r\n\r\nClement V (1305-13), whom the patriotic Italian poet places in hell for\r\nhis subservience to the French king, was the first to take up his\r\nresidence in Avignon, but his building enterprises were elsewhere, at\r\nBordeaux and St. Bertrand-de-Comminges, and he chose to be buried near\r\nBordeaux, at Uzeste, his native place, where his tomb was mutilated in\r\n1577. Clement is pictured on the walls of the Spanish chapel in Santa\r\nMaria Novella at Florence. Neither his statue at the chief portal of\r\nBordeaux Cathedral nor his effigy on his tomb is a portrait.\r\n\r\nAfter an interval he was succeeded by John XXII (1316-33), born in\r\nCahors, where a tower of his palace still stands, as well as the most\r\nbeautiful bridge of the Middle Ages, which he helped to build. John had\r\nbeen educated at Cahors, Montpellier, and Paris; he had taught law at\r\nToulouse, and from 1310 was bishop of Avignon, so that he made it his\r\npermanent residence when elected to the papacy at seventy-two. John was\r\nan organizer of genius; he founded Perugia University and reformed those\r\nof Paris, Cambridge, and Oxford. The great treasure he left was the fund\r\ndrawn on by his successors for the erection of their palace. His tomb in\r\nthe cathedral of Avignon is like an immense reliquary, excessive lace\r\nstonework and pinnacles, though if some of the sixty statues that once\r\nembellished it remained, there would naturally be more character in the\r\nornamentation. The tomb has recently been claimed as a late-Gothic\r\nwest-of-England work, similar to monuments at Exeter and Tewksbury.\r\n\r\nHis successor, Benedict XII (1333-42), was the pope who really began the\r\nAvignon palace which was to be completed in twenty-five years. While\r\nabbot of Cistercian Fontfroide, he had watched Narbonne's episcopal\r\npalace rising, and there are decided likenesses between it and the papal\r\nresidence on the Rhone. Both were fortresses eminently of the Midi, not\r\nof Italy. Of Benedict it is related that when his father, a baker in the\r\ncomté of Foix, came to visit him, dressed richly by courtiers who\r\nthought to save the pope's _amour propre_, the pope declined to\r\nrecognize him till he garbed himself humbly. His was a complex\r\ncharacter. He spent vast sums lavishly on his palace, bringing artists\r\nfrom Italy to decorate its walls and ceilings. His tomb, that had\r\nresembled his predecessor's, exists only in a few arcades housed in the\r\nMusée Calvert. The tomb called his in the cathedral is a composite\r\naffair. There is a statue of Benedict XII in the crypt of the Vatican.\r\n\r\nThe next pontiff, Clement VI (1342-52), a Limousin lord of great\r\nlineage, more knight than churchman, made the most beautiful parts of\r\nthe papal palace, the conclave gallery, the Audience Chamber, the\r\nPontifical Chapel over it, and the tower called St. Jeane whose chapels,\r\n_sotto_ and _sopra_, were decorated by Martini. Petrarch had praised\r\nClement for his liberality toward the Jews, who, driven out of other\r\ncountries, found a home here, \"_povres Juifs ars et escacés par tout le\r\nmonde excepté en la terre d'Église dessous les clefs des papes_.\" For\r\nhis burial Clement VI rebuilt, in the Forez mountains, the church of his\r\nformer abbey, La Chaise Dieu, in the center of whose choir he placed his\r\nown sumptuous monument, whose forty-four statuettes represented his\r\ngreat relatives. In the religious wars of the XVI century the mausoleum\r\nwas sacked and only the pontiff's marble effigy now remains.\r\n\r\nClement VI purchased the city of Avignon from Queen Joanna of Naples of\r\nthe Anjou house. The Comtat-Venaissin, but not Avignon, formed part of\r\nthe possessions that fell to the French Crown on the death of Alphonse\r\nof Poitiers and his wife in 1271. Philippe III gave it to the popes, to\r\nwhom it had been promised by the last count of Toulouse.\r\n\r\nThe papal palace was finished by Innocent VI (1352-62), another\r\nLimousin. He made the tower applied to the south wall of audience hall\r\nand church, and he added to the city's fortifications. Across the Rhone\r\nhe began the Chartreuse, later called Val de Bénédiction, a vast\r\nstructure carried on by his family as a hereditary obligation.[266]\r\nTo-day it is a mass of desolate ruins, and the pope's mutilated tomb is\r\nnow housed in the hospice at Villeneuve-lès-Avignon.\r\n\r\nUrban V (1362-70), \"_moult saint homme et de belle vie_,\" says\r\nFroissart, was a patron for art and letters throughout the Midi. At\r\nAvignon he continued the fortifications. His work is to be found in\r\nMontpellier Cathedral, also at Mende, St. Flour, and Marseilles, where\r\nhis mausoleum towers in St. Victor's abbatial. His attempt to\r\nre-establish the papacy in Rome failed, but his successor, Gregory\r\nXI--Count Roger de Beaufort, a nephew of Clement VI--went back\r\ndefinitely in 1377 to the Holy City, where a bas-relief on his tomb, in\r\nSanta Francesca Romana, records his triumphal entrance. The consequences\r\nof the long exile were deplorable. Immediately came the Great Schism of\r\nthe West, during which some of the doubtful pontiffs resided at Avignon.\r\n\r\nAfter their return to Rome the popes governed their small Midi\r\nprincipality by viceroys till at the time of the Revolution it passed to\r\nFrance. The palace was turned into a prison and barracks; when a local\r\nantiquarian society begged that they might be allowed to preserve the\r\nprecious frescoes of Simone Martini in the chapels of Clement VI, the\r\nmilitary governor replied that such notions were contrary to military\r\ncustom. Happily the Palace of the Popes is now a national monument, and\r\nits judiciously accomplished renovation is one of those restorals\r\nagainst which no one can cavil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nThe Gothic Art of Burgundy[267]\r\n\r\n    _Be strong in humility and humble in authority:\r\n    Be austere in tenderness and tender in austerity:\r\n    Be amiable in sorrow and grave in prosperity._\r\n    --ST. COLUMBANUS' Antitheses.\r\n\r\n\r\nBurgundy, \"a country placed on Europe's highways,\" was a land of\r\nmonasteries. They dotted the fertile province. There were \"prodigious\r\nCluny,\" and Vézelay \"the superb,\" scenes of historic gatherings; at\r\nAuxerre was St. Germain's monastery; at Dijon, the abbey of St. Bénigne,\r\npioneer in the Romanesque renaissance of the region. There were Cîteaux,\r\nthe mother house of missions over the entire Christian world, Pontigny,\r\nthat harbored three archbishops of Canterbury, Fontenay with its\r\nindustrial forge, Tournus, Saulieu, Paray-le-Monial, and Flavigny, that\r\nreminded Chateaubriand of Jerusalem set on its hill. Up and down the\r\nland the _laus perennis_ never ceased.\r\n\r\nOn the confines of the old kingdom of Burgundy, as the VI century\r\nclosed, St. Columbanus founded at Luxeuil, between the sources of the\r\nMoselle and the Saône, an abbey which was to mold the religious life of\r\nthe VII century, most fertile of epochs in the number and fervor of its\r\nreligious institutions. Luxeuil became the popular school of Gaul, the\r\nmother house of hundreds of monasteries. Her monks filled the sees of\r\nFrance. The Celtic Rule was harsh, a compound of the Orient, of Lerens,\r\nand of Bangor in Ireland; even on feast days fish was a luxury. It was\r\nonly the personal genius of the impetuous Irish missionary that caused\r\nit to be accepted for a few generations; then as the VII century closed,\r\nthe Benedictine Rule which conformed better to human limitations\r\nsuperseded the Columban. \"Where Columbanus sowed, Benedict reaped.\"[268]\r\n\r\nThree hundred years later there rose in Burgundy the most splendid\r\nmonastic institution that Christendom has ever known, Benedictine Cluny,\r\nthat stood shoulder to shoulder with the reforming popes in their fight\r\nfor the purification of the Church.[269] Cluny initiated the Truce of\r\nGod, the peace movement of the XI century that permitted the art\r\nrenaissance which was to culminate in the Gothic cathedrals. Peace\r\nmeant an unmolested commerce, peace meant city charters and stable laws.\r\nA reformed clergy meant the renewal of the people's love of the altar,\r\nand their generous contributions toward the erection of churches. With\r\nCluny as leader there was then formulated the architecture which was a\r\nstepping stone to a greater system.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years after Cluny's foundation, Burgundy again gave birth to\r\na monastic movement which was to carry to the ends of Europe the Gothic\r\nsystem of building. Cîteaux, in the extent of its conquests and its\r\ncentralized administration, has been compared with the Roman Empire.\r\nCistercian monks carried Burgundian Gothic to Spain, to Italy, to\r\nGreece, to England, Germany, and Scandinavia. Owing to the conditions of\r\nsociety and of the episcopacy, the cloister then was chief patron of\r\nart. Simony infected the bishoprics and it is not under unworthy\r\nprelates that churches are reared. Gregory VII, Cluny, that supplied him\r\nwith his army of reformers, and St. Bernard, with his white-cowled\r\nbrethren, warred unceasingly on simony, concubinage, and investiture\r\n(the tormenting question of layman control of churchmen). And since it\r\nwas monasteries that fought that battle of regeneration, monastic\r\nchurches and not cathedrals were the first tangible proof of the ethical\r\nrebirth of Europe. _À la peine ... à l'honneur._ When the reform\r\nachieved by Cluny and Cîteaux had filled the sees with worthy bishops,\r\nthen were built the great cathedrals.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the problem of roofing churches in stone caused the\r\nevolution from Romanesque to Gothic art. Burgundy's struggle to achieve\r\na permanent stone roof was bolder than that of other regional schools in\r\nFrance, and perhaps it was overhardy, since her abbatials, in Gothic\r\ntimes, had to be buttressed to keep them standing. Though the Burgundian\r\ndiscarded too early the Romanesque principle of equilibrium by dead\r\nload, his temerity was a step forward in the march toward new principles\r\nof construction. These monks on Europe's highway made churches of ample\r\nwidth and height, and, rather than sacrifice their proper lighting,\r\nopened windows in the upper walls of the central vessel. However, they\r\nmust have felt that their clearstory windows were an experiment, for\r\nthey essayed, occasionally, an embryo flying buttress, keeping it hidden\r\nunder the lean-to roof of the aisles.\r\n\r\nThe militant Romanesque school of Burgundy was too well developed for it\r\nto bow instantly before the new art. Not here did the generating member\r\nof Gothic architecture first come into common usage, but in that region\r\nof northern France whose pre-Gothic school was of less importance. The\r\nBurgundian clung stubbornly to his early ways of building, and even\r\nafter other provinces had accepted the ogival style he erected\r\nthoroughly Romanesque churches; St. Philibert at Dijon is the\r\ncontemporary of the cathedrals at Chartres and Paris. Flying buttresses\r\nat no time found favor in Burgundy. Groin vaults were persisted in\r\nsimultaneously with diagonals, and the sexpartite vault used long after\r\nthe north had dropped it. Firm plain profiles for archivolts and window\r\nmolds were preferred.\r\n\r\nOnce the Burgundian frankly accepted the new system, his bold genius led\r\nhim to push its principles to their limit. Within the confines of the\r\nduchy were the quarries of hard Tonnerre stone that permitted audacious\r\nexperiments in building. He dared traverse his exterior buttresses by\r\ncirculation passages, he dared catch his heavily weighted diagonals on\r\ncorbels (carved with original heads), and to poise a mass of material on\r\nthe slenderest of colonnettes. Often he surmounted his triforium by a\r\npassage that passed directly through the active wall shafts, as in\r\ncathedrals of Auxerre, Nevers, and Semur. By the middle of the XIII\r\ncentury Dijon achieved a marvel of Gothic technique in its church of\r\nNotre Dame. Despite much notable Gothic work one is inclined, none the\r\nless, to maintain that Burgundy found her fullest expression in her\r\nearlier monastic churches. Alas, that the greatest of them, Cluny,\r\nshould to-day be but the phantom of its once colossal self!\r\n\r\n\r\nCLUNY[270]\r\n\r\n     Time will be ending soon, heaven will be rending soon, fast we and\r\n     pray we: Comes the most merciful; comes the most terrible; watch we\r\n     while may we.\r\n\r\n     --BERNARD DE MORLAIX, \"Jerusalem the Golden\"[271] (c. 1140).\r\n\r\nThe \"mother abbey of Europe\" lies in a fertile valley some fifteen miles\r\noff the express route that passes through Mâcon. The property was given\r\nto the monks by a duke of Aquitaine, who thus anathematized future\r\ndespoilers: \"I conjure you O holy Apostles Peter and Paul, to cut off\r\nfrom life eternal all robbers, invaders, or sellers of that which I\r\nherewith donate with full satisfaction and entire free will.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Cluny was founded in 910, the victory of Christianity over the\r\nBarbarians still hung in the balance. It was Cluny that weighed down the\r\nscale for justice and progress, Cluny that gave to Rome the needed\r\nreforming popes. Hers should be a name as honored in humanity's history\r\nas Athens: \"We leave college,\" wrote Montalembert, \"able to cite the\r\nlist of Jupiter's mistresses, but ignorant, even to their names, of the\r\nfounders of the religious Orders that civilized Europe.\" And the\r\ntestimony of the Protestant Leibnitz is: \"Without monks we should\r\nhave no erudition, for it is certain that we owe to monasteries the\r\npreservation of letters and books.\" Four of the best among the popes\r\ncame out of Cluny's cloister: Gregory VII, Urban II, Paschal II, and\r\nUrban V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The XI-century Sanctuary of Cluny as It Was until the\r\nRevolution_]\r\n\r\nThe modern French school of mediæval archæology, delving into the past,\r\nhas drawn Cluny from its long oblivion. In 1910 was celebrated with\r\nnational honors the millennium of the Burgundian \"abbey of abbeys,\" and\r\nto the festival the French Academy sent M. René Bazin as its\r\nrepresentative to voice the gratitude of French letters to the \"great\r\nOrder of Cluny which in the France of the Middle Ages exercised in its\r\nplenitude the mission of civilizer, apostle of the Gospel, apostle of\r\npeace, guardian of the whole field of knowledge, founder then, of all\r\nworks of charity, initiator of both literary and agricultural progress,\r\ncreator of an art which she spread over Europe.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the Middle Ages the silent Burgundian valley was a busy hive of\r\narts and crafts[272] with goldsmiths' work, illuminating, carving in\r\nivory and in stone, foundering of bells, and the making of stained\r\nglass. All that went toward the adornment of God's house was fostered in\r\nCluniac schools, but above all was the master art of the builder\r\nhonored. In bands of twelve the monks carried not only the Gospel, but\r\nthe arts to every part of Europe, and even farther afield, for there\r\nwere houses of the Order on Mount Tabor, in Nazareth, and in Bethany. No\r\nuniform Cluniac building lore was followed; it was the usual custom for\r\nthe monks to conform to the local traditions in each different\r\ncountry.[273]\r\n\r\nIt was natural that the big abbey church at Cluny proper should have\r\nbeen Burgundian Romanesque. Hazelon, a monk of Cluny, was the\r\nmaster-of-works, a learned man who had once occupied a high position in\r\nthe world; he is said to have himself worked here with trowel and\r\nmortar. The tunnel vaulting was braced by transverse ribs that were\r\nslightly pointed; clearstory windows were opened in the upper walls. The\r\nchanneled pilasters were a heritage from the classic traditions of the\r\nregion; near by, in Rome's former capital of Autun, were many monuments\r\nof antiquity.\r\n\r\nCluny's abbey church of St. Peter was the largest in the world, and\r\ncovered an area about equal to that of the present St. Peter's at Rome.\r\nIt was over five hundred and fifty feet long; the cathedral at Paris is\r\nnot four hundred feet in length. There were double aisles and double\r\ntransepts. St. Hugues of Cluny, the sixth abbot, \"a man of God greatest\r\namong the great,\" \"the pupil of the papacy's eye,\" ruled the Burgundian\r\nmother house during the sixty years that Cluny guided Christendom (1049\r\nto 1109). No flattery, no subtlety could turn him from pure justice.\r\nUnder him were trained Hildebrand, the future Gregory VII, who led the\r\nforces of church reform. \"The giving up of justice is the shipwreck of\r\nthe soul,\" said Gregory VII. Abbot Hugues trained also Urban II, who\r\npreached the First Crusade. Among the houses he founded were St.\r\nMartin-des-Champs at Paris, and St. Pancras at Lewes; in England there\r\nwere thirty-five Cluniac establishments in the time of Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nTwice St. Hugues went into Spain, where his niece was the Queen of\r\nCastile, engaged in substituting the liturgy of the Church universal for\r\nthe Mozarabic rite. To the town of Cluny he granted a commune, and he\r\nbuilt two of its parish churches, Notre Dame and St. Marcel.[274] When\r\nhe felt death approaching, he had himself carried before the altar of\r\nSt. Marcel, there to breathe his last on a bed of ashes, and a few days\r\nearlier than the Easter Tuesday of 1109 on which he passed away, his\r\ndear friend and frequent visitor at Cluny, St. Anselm of Canterbury,\r\ndied, being privileged, he said, to go to meet his Saviour in time for\r\nthe blessed Easter feast. Those two great men of the cloister by their\r\nethical and intellectual leadership laid the basis for the Gothic\r\ncathedrals.\r\n\r\nThe choir of St. Peter's, at Cluny, was blessed by Urban II, in 1095,\r\nwhen he came into France to preach the First Crusade. He passed a week\r\nin his old home, after which he and his beloved master, St. Hugues,\r\nproceeded to the historic gathering at Clermont. The nave of St. Peter's\r\nwas carried forward by succeeding abbots of Cluny, and many a pope was\r\nto watch the edifice rising. Paschal II passed the winter of 1106-07 in\r\nCluny, and his successor, Gelasius II, died there in 1119; he had\r\nrecently consecrated the new Romanesque cathedral of Pisa.[275] On the\r\nsite of the wing of the cloister where he lodged now stands a\r\nXIV-century building called by his name. On his death the cardinals at\r\nCluny held conclave, electing as pope a member of the ducal house of\r\nBurgundy, the bishop of Vienne, who took the name Calixtus II; in Cluny\r\nchurch he canonized the great Abbot Hugues.\r\n\r\nSt. Hugues' successor, Pons de Melgueil, after an estimable career, was\r\nled by pride to a downfall. On his resignation, Pierre de Montboissier,\r\nan Auvergne noble, known in history as Peter the Venerable, became the\r\nninth abbot (1122-56). At that time he was but thirty years of age. Pons\r\nreturned, seized Cluny abbey, and in the ensuing disorders the vaulting\r\nof the new nave collapsed. Abbot Peter restored the stone roof, and\r\nInnocent II dedicated the completed church in 1131.\r\n\r\nThe capitals then carved are to be seen in the town's Museum. Some of\r\nthem personified the eight tones of liturgical music, for Cluny excelled\r\nin song, and every twenty-four hours her vast basilica echoed to the\r\nchanting of the entire book of Psalms; never, says the old chronicle,\r\nwas there pause in the _saintes clameurs_, the _laus perennis_ started\r\nby Irish Columbanus in the valleys of Burgundy. Some of the capitals\r\nfrom the abbatial are contemporaries of the statuary at Vézelay, where\r\nPeter the Venerable had been prior, and where his brother, Pons de\r\nMontboissier, was abbot. Vézelay was a pilgrimage church, so that its\r\nimagery was made of more popular character than that of Cluny, where\r\nworshiped an intellectual élite.\r\n\r\nCluny began the carving of the Bible for the Poor. The Burgundians were\r\nthe first to develop the imaged portal which the Gothic cathedrals were\r\nto elaborate into their sumptuous triple entrances. While Cluny was\r\nbuilding, a monk in the monastery composed a poem of some thousand\r\nlines, opening with a vision of the heavenly Jerusalem. Bernard of\r\nMorlaix must have found inspiration in his own Burgundian basilica,\r\nwhich we know to have contained over three hundred windows of\r\ntranslucent mosaic. He dedicated his poem to his beloved abbot, Pierre\r\nde Montboissier.\r\n\r\nPeter the Venerable was no Puritan in art, as was his friend St.\r\nBernard, with whom he had many a skirmish, owing to their temperamental\r\ndifferences and the rivalship of their respective Orders. The abbot of\r\nCluny never wavered in his reverence for the \"fellow citizen of angels,\"\r\nas he called the abbot of Clairvaux, and Bernard saw in Peter, man of\r\nthe world though he was, \"a vessel of election full of truth and grace.\"\r\n\r\nLike Abbot Suger, Pierre de Montboissier was the type of the liberal\r\nculture of the Benedictine, and he was to live again in the XVII-century\r\nscholars of the St. Maur reform, even as Bernard's uncompromising spirit\r\nreappeared then in De Rancy and his Trappists, a reform of Cîteaux. Like\r\nSuger, Peter the Venerable was a quoter of the classics, and a literary\r\nman. \"To write was for an abbot of Cluny a hereditary tradition,\" said a\r\nXII-century historian. He had Arabic taught at Cluny for mission\r\npurposes. Journeying in Spain, he was the first to have the Koran\r\ntranslated for Europe; he held it to be Islam's best refutation. Very\r\nmodern appears this old-time abbot in the zest with which he set out to\r\ntravel, to inspect the houses of his Order. When he died in 1156, he was\r\nruling over two thousand establishments, in every part of Christendom.\r\n\r\nIn person Peter was distinguished, and in character most generous,\r\nhumane, and free from narrowness. He was wisely moderate always, and\r\nsimple and direct. The letters of his which still exist make him a\r\nliving personality. Though as keen a theologian as his friend Bernard,\r\nAbbot Peter kept the defeated Abélard with him at Cluny until his\r\nirritated spirit was soothed, and when the great schoolman died in 1142,\r\nAbbot Peter wrote to Héloïse, in her nunnery of the Paraclete, in Troyes\r\ndiocese, to arrange that Abélard's body be brought there for burial, and\r\nhe himself went to preach the funeral sermon.[276] In his letter to\r\nHéloïse he said that never had he seen truer humility and retirement\r\nthan Maître Pierre's; \"after which,\" as M. René Bazin remarks, \"none of\r\nus need despair.\"\r\n\r\nCluny's abbatial of St. Peter was enlarged in the XIII century by a\r\nforechurch of several bays, with double aisles. An antechurch or narthex\r\nwas a frequent addition to the Burgundian basilica; sometimes it was\r\nopen as at Autun and Beaune, sometimes wholly inclosed as at Vézelay.\r\nAlthough Cluny's narthex was built as late as 1220, groin vaulting was\r\nused for the aisles.\r\n\r\nIn 1245 Innocent IV paused for a month at Cluny, having in his train a\r\ndozen cardinals and their suites, and Louis IX came for a fortnight's\r\nconference with the pope, accompanied by the queen mother, his brothers,\r\nand courtiers. The emperor of Constantinople and the heirs both of\r\nCastile and Aragon were guests at that same time, and yet so immense was\r\nthe establishment, that all were accommodated without the monks quitting\r\ntheir usual quarters. In 1248 St. Louis paused again in Cluny before his\r\nfirst crusade.\r\n\r\nWith material success came spiritual decline. The tale runs the same in\r\nmost of man's organizations. As a reformer Cluny was succeeded first by\r\nthe Cistercians, whose fervor lasted for a century, when were needed the\r\ntwo mendicant Orders of Francis and Dominic. The system that allowed the\r\nking to appoint abbots, initiated by the Concordat of 1516, proved\r\nfatal, and there is truth in the saying that the court prelates paved\r\nthe way for the religious wars. Three times in those bitter years of\r\nstrife was Cluny sacked, its famous library ravaged, and its art\r\ntreasures burned.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution completed the ruin. The first mob that marched out from\r\nMâcon to wreck the abbey was dispersed with firearms by the townspeople.\r\nThe municipality of Cluny wrote to the National Assembly to tell of the\r\nconstant benefits it had derived from the monks--so the rationalist\r\nTaine relates in his _Ancien Régime_--but the impious wrecking of the\r\ngreat monastery went on. Day after day cartloads of rare books were\r\nbrought to feed the bonfires in the square. All through 1793 bands of\r\nlooters came out from Mâcon to break windows and destroy images. The\r\nindignant townspeople looked on impotently at the vandalism that spelled\r\ntheir own material decline. At Napoleon's advent they sent petition\r\nafter petition to try to save the big church, but the Mâcon merchant who\r\nhad purchased it proceeded to open a road right up its nave and sold the\r\nstones as building materials. First the narthex was blown up with\r\ngunpowder; then a transept arm. When the huge central tower fell with\r\nstupefying noise the people shivered with a nameless fear. The history\r\nof France was being obliterated before their eyes.\r\n\r\nTo save what remained the town offered in exchange its communal lands\r\nand market halls. In vain; the grandest monastic church in the world was\r\ndemolished piecemeal after the nineteenth century opened. Some seven or\r\neight towers had crowned St. Peter's. In 1811 the one over the choir was\r\ndestroyed. Gunpowder blew up the stately pillars of Pentelic marble and\r\nItalian cipolin set around his sanctuary by St. Hugues seven hundred\r\nyears before. They destroyed the frescoes of the apse, which were so\r\nfresh that one who then sketched them said that they seemed to have come\r\nstraight from the artist's brush.\r\n\r\nTo-day little of the abbey church is standing. There are vestiges of the\r\nchoir, a small tower, and the south arm of the main transept with a big\r\ntower over it. There also remains the Flamboyant Gothic chapel built by\r\nAbbot Jean de Bourbon (1456-81), out of the smaller transept. In the\r\ntown street are evidences of where the western doors of the abbatial\r\nonce stood. The entrance arches to the abbey grounds are intact, and\r\nsome few of the towers of the inclosure walls. The museum is now housed\r\nin the monastery's guest quarters built by Jean de Bourbon. His\r\nsuccessor, Abbot Jacques d'Amboise (1481-1514), erected the pavilion\r\nwhich now serves as Town Hall. Both of those art-loving prelates\r\nconstructed at Paris the Hôtel Cluny as town residence for the abbot of\r\nthe Burgundian mother house.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE ABBATIAL OF PARAY-LE-MONIAL[277]\r\n\r\n    The world is very evil,\r\n      The times are waxing late,\r\n    Be sober and keep vigil,\r\n      The Judge is at the gate!\r\n    The Judge that comes in mercy,\r\n      The Judge that comes with might,\r\n    To terminate the evil\r\n      To diadem the right.\r\n    --BERNARD DE MORLAIX, \"Jerusalem the Golden.\"[278]\r\n\r\nNot far from Cluny lies Paray-le-Monial, \"a town very dear to heaven,\"\r\nsaid Leo XIII's brief of 1896. The monastery was founded by the second\r\nabbot of Cluny, St. Majolus, who was instrumental in bringing to France\r\nWilliam of Volpiano, the leading spirit in the renaissance of\r\narchitecture after the year 1000. The present abbatial resembles on a\r\nvery small scale that of Cluny. Its barrel vaulting is braced by pointed\r\narches and there are the channeled pilasters of Rome's tradition in the\r\nregion. The exterior of the apse and the carven doorway are gems of\r\npre-Gothic art. Towers and porch date from the end of the XI century,\r\nand the remainder about 1130. At present the monastery church (which is\r\nabominably marred with whitewash) is dedicated to the Sacré Coeur, a\r\ndevotion that was initiated by the Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque, who\r\ndied in the Visitation convent of this town in 1690. Paray-le-Monial has\r\nbecome one of the pilgrimages of modern France.\r\n\r\nSt. Odilo, who governed Cluny for the half century preceding the\r\nsixty-year rule of Abbot Hugues, loved especially the priory of\r\nParay-le-Monial. He inspired and organized the Truce of God, the _Treuga\r\nDei_, by which war was prohibited on certain days and in certain holy\r\nseasons. The monk, Raoul Glaber, to whom Odilo was patron, has described\r\nin a chronicle covering the period from 900 to 1047 (an invaluable\r\ndocument for the sources of the Capetian line) how the war-wrecked\r\npopulace flocked to the church councils that were their only hope, their\r\nhands uplifted, with the beseeching cry, \"Peace! Peace! Peace!\" In the\r\nrebirth of hope and energy that succeeded to the terrors of the year\r\n1000, Glaber has told us how the earth reclothed herself in a white\r\nmantle of churches. He had been spurred on to write his history by the\r\nchief builder of the age, William of Volpiano. The great monastic\r\nchurchmen of Burgundy were leaders in the movement that was to\r\nculminate, within four generations, in Gothic cathedrals. To Abbot Odilo\r\nis attributed, also, the founding of the feast of All Souls, which he\r\nset on the day following All Saints, as if to place the suffering ones\r\nin the care of the elect. From the observance of this feast in Cluny\r\nhouses it spread to the entire Church.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE CATHEDRAL OF AUTUN[279]\r\n\r\n     Et c'est ainsi que Dieu travaille quand il veut nous châtier sans\r\n     nous perdre, quand il ne veut pas que la guerre finisse, par le\r\n     feu, le sang, la désolation générale, la ruine entière et le\r\n     changement d'un État. _Il sépare les gens de bien_: il faut que les\r\n     uns se mettent avec choix au parti qu'ils estiment le plus juste,\r\n     et que les autres se trouvent dans le parti qu'ils approuvent\r\n     quelquefois le moins.--LE PRÉSIDENT JEANNIN (1540-1622; born in\r\n     Autun).\r\n\r\nAutun's chief church, one of the few cathedrals in France which is\r\nRomanesque, was begun in 1120 and consecrated in 1132 by Innocent II. In\r\nthat same year he blessed Cluny's nave and Vézelay's narthex. A friend\r\nof St. Bernard, Bishop Étienne de Baugé (1112-36), was its chief\r\nbenefactor, as he was, also, of the Burgundian abbey of Saulieu.[280]\r\n\r\nThe Last Judgment over Autun's west door, signed by one Gislebertus,\r\ndates from that period. Its strange, elongated figures are not the\r\nculmination of an old art, but a first effort in a development that was\r\nto produce the imaged portals of Gothic cathedrals. Autun's curious\r\ntympanum was saved from the iconoclasts of the Revolution because the\r\n_gens de goût_ of the XVIII century had covered it over with the\r\nneo-classic plaster ornamentation they preferred. The graceful trumeau\r\nimages of Lazarus, Martha, and Mary are restorations. Before the western\r\ndoor an open narthex for the use of lepers was added about 1178.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of the XII century, the cathedral school was directed,\r\nduring thirty years, by Honoré d'Autun, whose popular book, _The Mirror\r\nof the Church_, introduced the use of animal symbolism into the\r\niconography of cathedrals. M. Mâle discovered that the New Alliance\r\nwindow in Lyons Cathedral copied his book verbatim. In the learned\r\nHonoré's day Autun Cathedral had not yet laid claim to the relics of the\r\nrisen Lazarus. Originally the church was consecrated to St. Nazaire,\r\nwhich name was changed to Lazare after the Burgundian abbey of Vézelay\r\nhad spread the story that Mary Magdalene had died in Provence. No one\r\nknew how Autun obtained the relics said to be those of Lazarus of\r\nBethany. They were first exposed for veneration in the cathedral in\r\n1147. Monseigneur Duchesne has thought that the legend grew by\r\nunconscious fabrications. It certainly did the Burgundian towns little\r\nharm to honor those whom the Lord had cherished. Through long centuries\r\nBurgundy delighted to call her sons Lazare.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Autun has a barrel vault undergirded by pointed arches.\r\nChanneled pilasters,[281] great and small, abound; they are on all four\r\nsides of the piers. In Autun stand gateways of Rome's empire to serve as\r\nclassic models. The acanthus leaves of the cathedral's triforium can\r\ncompare with those of the Porte d'Arroux. Autun was a Roman capital in\r\nGaul, founded by Augustus. It covered then twice its present area.\r\nAgrippa, son-in-law of Augustus, built the great military road that ran\r\nfrom Lyons to Autun, Autun to Auxerre, Auxerre to Troyes, Troyes to\r\nChâlons-sur-Marne, Châlons to Rheims, Rheims to Soissons, Soissons to\r\nSenlis, Senlis to Beauvais, Beauvais to Amiens, and thence to\r\nBoulogne-sur-Mer.\r\n\r\nThe graceful central tower of the cathedral was added in the Flamboyant\r\nGothic day by Cardinal Rolin (d. 1483), son of the builder of Beaune\r\nHospital, Nicolas Rolin (a native of Autun), the self-seeking but able\r\nchancellor of Duke Philippe le Bon. Another son of Autun was Pierre\r\nJeannin, president of the parliament of Burgundy and minister of Henry\r\nIV. His father, a tanner, was a man of civic importance in the town.\r\nPresident Jeannin's kneeling statue and that of his wife, Anne Gueniot,\r\nare now in the cathedral choir, being all that remained, after the\r\nRevolution, of his tomb made by Nicolas Guillan of Paris. No man ever\r\nhad a truer passion for the public weal than this Burgundian magistrate\r\nwho saved Burgundy from the stain of blood on St. Bartholomew's day in\r\n1572. Word came from the king to kill, but the Catholic Jeannin on the\r\ngovernor's council at Dijon urged delay, saying that when a king's\r\norders were given in anger, the wisest course was procrastination. He\r\nwas to live long enough to aid Henry IV in drawing up the Edict of\r\nNantes in 1598.\r\n\r\nJeannin's attitude in 1572 was all the more meritorious because Burgundy\r\nhad suffered acutely from the Calvinists, who invited their\r\nco-religionists from Germany to fight their fellow citizens. In 1569 a\r\nband of the invaders left behind them a trail of four hundred burned\r\nvillages. Cluny was attacked, and Cîteaux was sacked from top to bottom;\r\nto-day some XIV-century debris is all that marks the mother house of the\r\nCistercian Order. The destruction of Cîteaux was irreparable for art,\r\nsince during centuries its abbatial was the St. Denis of the first\r\nCapetian dukes who ruled Burgundy. The leading families of the province\r\nfelt it an honor to be buried at Cîteaux. In its church was once the\r\nsplendid tomb (now in the Louvre) of the seneschal of Burgundy, Philippe\r\nPot (d. 1494). The effigy of the baron in armor is carried on the\r\nshoulders of eight black, cowled figures--a further development of the\r\n_pleurant_ type of tomb.\r\n\r\nIn a chapel of Autun Cathedral is a beautiful modern statue of Pope\r\nGregory the Great, presented to Cardinal Perraud (1882-1906) of the\r\nFrench Academy, as bishop of this ancient city whose prelate in the VI\r\ncentury had entertained Augustine and his monks on their way to\r\nmissionize England. Cardinal Vaughan of Westminster was the donor of\r\nthis grateful souvenir.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOSPITAL AND ROMANESQUE COLLEGIATE AT BEAUNE[282]\r\n\r\n     L'art du Moyen Âge--aussi ennemi de l'art académique figé dans ses\r\n     moules conventionnels que du désordre matérialiste--est une\r\n     esthétique très simple, très certaine, très puissante et très\r\n     libre. Cette esthétique n'invoque pas un idéal abstrait; elle\r\n     impose le culte de la réalité, de la plus humble comme de la plus\r\n     éclatante; elle pourrait s'appeler un réalisme trancendant,\r\n     respectant la forme telle que Dieu l'a faite, et en même temps la\r\n     transfigurant par la grand frisson de l'au-delà.--ROBERT\r\n     VALLERY-RADOT.[283]\r\n\r\nThe Hospital of the Holy Ghost, built by Chancellor Nicolas Rolin from\r\n1444 to 1457, is a gem of the province, reminding us of the close union\r\nof Burgundy and the Netherlands under the four great dukes of the West.\r\nThe third of those rulers, Philippe le Bon, patronized Jean Van Eyck, as\r\ndid the enterprising man who was the duke's chancellor during forty\r\nyears. For a church at Autun, Rolin ordered of Van Eyck, in 1425, the\r\nmagnificent Madonna now in the Louvre in which he kneels as donor--a\r\nshrewd, hard-featured, capable man.\r\n\r\nFor his new hospital at Beaune he commissioned Roger Van der Weyden to\r\npaint, in many panels, the Last Judgment now in the little museum of the\r\nestablishment, but originally installed in the large raftered hall.\r\nAfter the Van Eyck's Adoration of the Lamb it was the most important\r\nwork of Flemish art undertaken. Philippe le Bon is portrayed in it\r\ntwice, and so is the donor. The outside of the panels is painted in\r\nmonochrome--what the French call _camaïeu_ from its cameo effect, and\r\nthe Italians call chiaroscuro. When this superb painting hung at the end\r\nof the hospital hall that ended in a chapel like the XIII-century\r\nhospice at Tonnerre, the patients could see it from their beds. The\r\nHôtel Dieu at Tonnerre had been founded by Marguerite of Burgundy, in\r\n1293. After the death of her husband, Charles d'Anjou, whose cruelty\r\nroused the Sicilian Vespers, she retired to the city of which she was\r\nhereditary countess, and with two other dethroned ladies, the Empress of\r\nConstantinople and the Countess of Tripoli, gave herself up to good\r\nworks. _La bonne Reyne_, the people called this princess who passed her\r\ndays serving the sick poor in a hospital where the spirit of the\r\nBeatitudes ruled. None was dismissed from its door without new cloak and\r\nshoes. To-day the great rafter-covered hall at Tonnerre lies empty; the\r\nraising of its pavement has somewhat impaired its proportion.\r\n\r\nBeaune's hospital hall, that indubitably copied Tonnerre's, serves still\r\nthe charitable purpose for which it was founded. Its quiet courtyard is\r\na vision of Flanders. In the kitchen the ancient iron crane of the\r\nfireplace is ornamented with I.H.S.; the Middle Ages made even work\r\nartistic. On feast days, such as Corpus Christi, the quaint half-timber\r\nhospice is hung with beautiful XV-century tapestry. It is deemed an\r\nhonor for the leading families of the region to count one of its members\r\namong the nuns whose service is for a few years, after which they may\r\nreturn to their own people.\r\n\r\nThe collegiate church of Notre Dame at Beaune is a typical Burgundian\r\nRomanesque edifice of the XII century, to which the following century\r\nadded a graceful open narthex of two bays. It possesses seventeen\r\nembroidered panels relating Our Lady's life, presented in 1500 by the\r\nChanoine Hugues le Coq, and held to be among the most lovely tapestries\r\nin France, evoking memories of Memling and the Flemish primitives.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVALLON, MONTRÉAL, FLAVIGNY, AND FONTENAY[284]\r\n\r\n     L'esprit humain, poussé par une force invincible, ne cessera jamais\r\n     de se demander: qu'y a-til au delà? Il ne sert à rien de répondre:\r\n     au delà sont des espaces, des temps, ou des grandeurs sans limites.\r\n     Nul ne comprend ces paroles. Celui qui proclame l'existence de\r\n     l'infini accumule dans cette affirmation plus de surnaturel qu'il\r\n     n'y en a dans tous les miracles de toutes les religions. La notion\r\n     de l'infini dans le monde j'en vois partout l'inévitable\r\n     expression. Par elle, le surnaturel est au fond de tous les\r\n     coeurs. L'idée de Dieu est une forme de l'idée de l'infini. Tant\r\n     que le mystère de l'infini pesera sur la pensée humaine, des\r\n     temples seront élevés au culte de l'infini. Et sur la dalle de ces\r\n     temples, vous verrez des hommes agenouillés, prosternés, abimés\r\n     dans la pensée de l'infini. Où sont les vraies sources de la\r\n     dignité humaine, de la liberté, et de la démocratie moderne, sinon\r\n     dans la notion de l'infini devant laquelle tous les hommes sont\r\n     égaux?--LOUIS PASTEUR (1822-95; born in Burgundy).[285]\r\n\r\nThe hill town of Avallon, above the gorge of the Cousin, with a square\r\nthat would do honor to any capital, makes a convenient center from which\r\nto explore various Burgundian churches. Its own church of St. Lazare\r\nstill possesses the apse and absidioles of the edifice blessed by\r\nPaschal II in 1107. The remainder of the church was built in mid-XII\r\ncentury, and the portal (in five orders richly carved, with channeled\r\nand twisted columns) belongs to the end of the century. A copy of\r\nAvallon's door is in the Trocadéro Museum at Paris where it can be\r\ncompared at close range with the two other notable Romanesque portals of\r\nthe province--those of Autun and Vézelay. The interior of St. Lazare is\r\nexcessively plain, having a high expanse of unbroken wall over the pier\r\narches, with the clearstory opened merely by little circular windows.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles from Avallon is the church of Montréal, like a feudal fort\r\nguarding one of the main passageways from Champagne. The lord of\r\nMontréal was among the few hundred barons who returned from the dire\r\nexperience of famine, treason, and death which was the Second Crusade,\r\non which had set forth a hopeful hundred thousand knights and pilgrims.\r\nIn the latter part of the XII century he built Montreal's collegiate\r\nchurch, one of the earliest Gothic ventures in the province, showing a\r\nsimultaneous use of Romanesque and Gothic vaulting. Its two westernmost\r\nbays were added early in the XIII century. The beautiful alabaster\r\nreredos of the XV century, and the carved choir stalls, are well worth\r\nstudying. Beyond Montréal, to the north of Avallon, lies Tonnerre's\r\nhospital hall and to the south can be visited the abbatial at Saulieu\r\nand the XIII-century castle of Chastellux, a son of which ancient house\r\nfought in America with Rochambeau and was the good friend of George\r\nWashington.[286]\r\n\r\nTo the east, at Flavigny, set picturesquely on a hill near the last\r\nstronghold held by the Gauls against the Romans, stood one of the most\r\ninteresting of abbey churches, of which portions of the XIII-century\r\nsanctuary remain, a few arches of the nave, and a Carolingian crypt\r\nbuilt by the abbot who ruled here from 755 to 768, hence that\r\nsubterranean chamber can claim to be the oldest dated monument extant in\r\nFrance. Over the choir of Flavigny was a cupola, and the Lady chapel was\r\nan XI-century octagon like that which William of Volpiano constructed\r\nfor his abbey at Dijon. This precious Benedictine abbatial was destroyed\r\nin the XIX century. At Flavigny are two ancient parish churches. What is\r\nnow the Pension Lacordaire was the Dominican convent opened in 1849 by\r\nthat brilliant son of Burgundy, with funds donated by his admirers of\r\nDijon.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast of Avallon, at Fontenay, near Montbard, is the oldest\r\nextant Romanesque church of the Cistercian Order, built from 1139 to\r\n1147, on land given by the lord of Montbard, the maternal uncle of St.\r\nBernard; on his mother's side St. Bernard was of the blood of Burgundy's\r\nfirst line of Capetian dukes. The great abbot of Clairvaux himself\r\nconducted hither the twelve monks who were to found the new house and\r\nreclaim the marshy region; and for his brethren of Fontenay he wrote his\r\ntreatise on Pride and Humility.\r\n\r\nThe first small sanctuary at Fontenay was soon replaced by the actual\r\none, built on the same lines as the church at Clairvaux, which no longer\r\nstands. Both followed the Cistercian plan; no tower; no triforium nor\r\nclearstory; uncut capitals; the east end rectangular; square chapels\r\nopening on the eastern wall of the transept. Funds for the new\r\nconstructions at Fontenay were provided by a wealthy English prelate who\r\nhad retired here, Evrard de Montgomery, of the Arundel family, who,\r\nwhile bishop of Norwich, completed the long Norman nave of that\r\ncathedral. In 1147 the church was consecrated by Pope Eugene III, St.\r\nBernard being present. As it was frequent in Cistercian monasteries to\r\nmake a specialty of some branch of manual work, Fontenay conducted a\r\nforge, and the massive XII-century building which housed it still\r\nstands. The forge, the abbey church, and the refectory to-day comprise\r\npart of a paper factory whose proprietor has taken a patriotic pride in\r\nrestoring these precious monuments of ancient Burgundy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIMARY GOTHIC ABBATIAL AT PONTIGNY[287]\r\n\r\n     Whatever draws us from the power of our senses, whatever makes the\r\n     past, the distant, or the future predominate over the present,\r\n     advances us in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me and\r\n     from my friends be the frigid philosophy as may conduct us\r\n     indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by\r\n     wisdom, bravery, or virtue.... That man is little to be envied\r\n     whose patriotism does not gain force on the plain of Marathon, or\r\n     whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona.--DR.\r\n     SAMUEL JOHNSON.\r\n\r\nThe oldest Gothic church in Burgundy is the Cistercian abbatial at\r\nPontigny. \"Cradle of bishops and asylum of great men,\" Pontigny is\r\n_parfumée de souvenirs_, to use a charming stilted French phrase. It was\r\nthe first daughter of Cîteaux, founded in 1114. When a pious canon of\r\nAuxerre proposed to endow a house of the new Order, the abbot of\r\nCîteaux, St. Stephen Harding, came to overlook the site on the confines\r\nof Champagne, and then sent twelve monks to found the house, under the\r\nleadership of Hugues de Mâcon, kinsman and childhood friend of St.\r\nBernard.\r\n\r\nThe Cistercians had not the Benedictines' weakness for a noble site, but\r\nif they planted their monasteries in a marsh--as at Fontenay and\r\nPontigny--their agricultural industry soon made the desert bloom. The\r\nearlier Cistercian churches obeyed St. Bernard's ascetic admonitions for\r\narchitecture, a Puritanism that became monotonous in the Italian\r\nchurches of the Order. In France the Cistercians ceased to adhere to\r\nchurch simplicity, raising sanctuaries such as Ourscamp, Longpont, and\r\nSt. Julien-le-Pauvre at Paris.\r\n\r\nNo towers adorned Pontigny, and stained glass was eschewed, but the\r\nleaded design of the grisaille windows is so lovely that, as M. André\r\nMichel has said, \"one could not be poor with more nobility.\" The\r\narchitect of Pontigny made skillful use of certain essential\r\nconstructive features to obtain his decorative effects. Thus, though\r\nmonastic sobriety was followed by omitting the triforium, the bare wall\r\nbetween pier arches and clearstory was relieved (at the sanctuary curve)\r\nby carrying down the moldings from the upper windows; and in the\r\nprocession path a fifth rib was introduced into each vault section,\r\nwhich rib fell on a corbel set above the entrance to each of the\r\nradiating chapels--a constructive subtlety by which was produced a\r\ngraceful wall arcade.\r\n\r\nThe present abbatial was begun a generation after the foundation of\r\nPontigny, with funds contributed by Thibaut the Great, Count of\r\nChampagne. The transept, which is Romanesque, rose from 1150 to 1160.\r\nWhile the walls of the nave were mounting, the master-of-works began to\r\nprepare for a Gothic vault over the principal span. The lower windows\r\nwere round-headed; the upper ones used the pointed arch. As the keystone\r\nof the diagonals was raised far above the arches framing each section, a\r\npronounced _bombé_ shape resulted. From 1160 to 1180 this transitional\r\nnave of Pontigny was building, and the most famous of the English\r\nexiles, who sought the hospitality of Pontigny, must have watched the\r\nworks. The choir, as first erected, had a rectangular eastern wall after\r\nthe usual manner of Cîteaux's churches. Then, from 1170 to 1200, the\r\npresent choir was erected with Gothic ambulatory and radiating\r\nchapels.[288] Alix of Champagne, daughter of the abbey's generous\r\npatron, and mother of the French king, Philippe-Auguste, was buried in\r\nthe new choir, in 1208. From 1207 to 1213 Pontigny harbored a second\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, Stephen Langton, of Magna Charta fame. During\r\nthe studious years he passed here he divided the Bible into chapters for\r\nthe first time, and even the Greeks accepted his rulings. In later life\r\nArchbishop Langton often looked back to this byway of Burgundy; \"his\r\ngarden, his solace, his abode of peace,\" he called it.\r\n\r\nHis predecessor at Pontigny was St. Thomas Becket, one of the\r\noutstanding figures of the XII century, whose story is told in many a\r\nFrench window and sculptured group. If ever an Englishman was all of a\r\npiece it was that son of a Rouen merchant settled in London. During his\r\nlife as a courtier Becket was so lavish in grandeur that when he passed\r\nthrough France as Henry II's ambassador, the countryside turned out to\r\nsee him, since few were the king's retinues that could equal his. When\r\nHenry raised him to the highest post in the English Church he instantly\r\ndropped luxury. He stood firm as a rock in defense of ecclesiastical\r\nrights against the king's attempt at Church supremacy. Tennyson's\r\n\"Becket\" says, \"I served King Henry well as Chancellor; I am his no\r\nmore, and I must serve the Church.\"\r\n\r\nTo the end of time such a character will be discussed; some for, some\r\nagainst, him; admired he certainly was by that sincerest and cleverest\r\nof men, John of Salisbury, who lived in his intimacy.[289] Both in\r\nEngland and France the populace felt that Becket was the champion of\r\ntheir civic rights by his defense of church independence--then the only\r\nsupreme court against lay tyranny. Undeviatingly and enthusiastically\r\nthey supported him all through his seven years' exile. One of the\r\narticles of the Clarendon Constitutions which Henry Plantagenet tried to\r\nimpose on English ecclesiastics was that no peasant could become a\r\npriest without his lord's permission. The poet voiced the indignant\r\noutcry: \"Hath not God called us all, bond or free, to his service?\"\r\n\r\nWhen Henry II, with his usual Angevin bad faith, duped his new\r\narchbishop into a promise to maintain the customs of the kingdom, and\r\nthereupon proceeded to revive obsolete customs, Becket, repenting the\r\nconcessions he had made, fled, in 1164, to Sens, to lay the case before\r\nAlexander III. The pope decided that certain of the Clarendon\r\npropositions were impossible for any churchman to accede to. The abbot\r\nof Pontigny offered hospitality to the persecuted primate and Becket\r\nstayed with him till 1168, conforming to the severe Cistercian Rule. He\r\nquitted the Burgundian monastery when Henry, in a burst of vindictive\r\nanger, threatened to shut up every house of the white monks in England\r\nas well as in his continental possessions if they harbored the\r\nrebellious churchman. Soon after Becket's arrival at Pontigny, the irate\r\nking sent thither the primate's relatives and friends, turned out to\r\nbeggary, in order that their plight might oppress the archbishop's\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nThe third exile from Canterbury, and the saint who has given his name to\r\nPontigny's abbatial, was a gentler spirit. St. Edmund Rich knew France\r\nas well as his native region of Oxford, having studied in Paris\r\nUniversity and taught there for years. It is told how his mother, Mabel,\r\nsent him to the foreign schools with a hair shirt and a cord whip in his\r\ngripsack in order that he might learn to chastise and thus curb himself.\r\nShe was a merchant's wife, and alone reared her family, to enable her\r\nhusband to follow the call he felt for the cloister; two of her\r\ndaughters died the saintly abbesses of Catesby. At the knee of that\r\nXIII-century mother the little Edmund, as a child, recited every Sunday\r\nthe entire book of Psalms. While lecturing at Oxford he initiated the\r\nstudy of Aristotle. In Paris, St. Edmund watched the cathedral of Notre\r\nDame perfecting itself, and at Salisbury, while treasurer, he assisted\r\nat the laying of the corner stone of the Gothic cathedral in 1220.\r\n\r\nWorsted in the struggle to right crying abuses in English church affairs\r\nwhere the king kept bishoprics vacant for his financial profit, and the\r\nqueen filled the sees with her own unpopular foreign relatives, the\r\narchbishop, accompanied by his chancellor, St. Richard, was on his way\r\nto Rome to remonstrate. He thought it wrong to condone further by his\r\npresence evils he was powerless to correct. He paused in Burgundy, and\r\nthere death came to him in 1243. To-day his tomb stands over the high\r\naltar of the abbey church named St. Edmé, in his memory. Puritan Bernard\r\nmost certainly would not approve the gymnastic-limbed angels that\r\ndecorate the present Renaissance tomb of St. Edmund, but one fears that\r\nhe would give his sanction to the whitewash that disfigures the interior\r\nof the interesting Primary Gothic church.\r\n\r\nTo the canonization ceremonies at Pontigny in honor of St. Edmund of\r\nAbingdon came St. Louis (who had known him well in Paris) and Blanche of\r\nCastile, and notables such as the archbishop-builder of Bourges\r\nCathedral, and St. Richard, now become bishop at Chichester, in which\r\ncathedral his tomb was destroyed, in 1538, by order of Henry VIII. Few\r\nspots in France are more entirely apart from the come-and-go of modern\r\nlife than is forgotten Pontigny, _parfumée de souvenirs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ABBATIAL OF VÉZELAY[290]\r\n\r\n     Il y a des lieux qui tirent l'âme de sa léthargie, des lieux\r\n     enveloppés, baignés de mystère, élus de toute éternité pour être le\r\n     siège de l'émotion religieuse ... l'héroique Vézelay, le mont\r\n     Saint-Michel, qui surgit comme un miracle des sables mouvants ...\r\n     lieux qui nous commandaient de faire taire nos pensées et d'écouter\r\n     plus profond que notre coeur. Silence! les dieux sont ici! Il y a\r\n     des lieux où souffle l'Esprit.--MAURICE BARRÉS, _La colline\r\n     inspirée_.[291]\r\n\r\nThe supreme excursion from Avallon is that to Vézelay, ten miles away.\r\nOne can drive to it or walk to it, since no railway touches the valley\r\nwhich once was the beaten thoroughfare for Christendom marching to\r\ncrusades. A good way to approach it in the proper spirit of pilgrimage\r\nis to walk from the station at Sermizelle with the church of St.\r\nMagdalene as the lodestar to guide one's steps. Vézelay has the aspect\r\nof a hill city of Umbria. The abbey church, Gothic in its choir,\r\nRomanesque in its nave, transition in its forechurch, and practically\r\nall of it of the XII century, crowns the hill like a cathedral.\r\n\r\n\"_Le grand nom de Vézelay sonne aux oreilles avec une sauvage poésie. La\r\nmajesté du site est digne de la splendeur du monument._\"[292] Always\r\nafterward will you remember this abode of reverie with that uplift of\r\nthe heart which high art and high thoughts arouse. Like loved sites in\r\nUmbria, this, too, is \"one of the earth's oases of spiritual rest and\r\nrefreshment.\"\r\n\r\nThe abbey was founded in the IX century by Girard de Roussillon[293] of\r\n_chanson de geste_ fame, but its position as a leading pilgrim shrine\r\nwas not established till Abbot Geoffrey was installed in 1037. Only then\r\ndid the relics of the Magdalene appear here, given, it was claimed, by\r\nCharles Martel as reward for Burgundian aid during Saracen inroads in\r\nthe Midi. Monseigneur Duchesne thinks that from Vézelay started the\r\nlegends so loved in Provence, that the privileged family of Bethany,\r\nwith others who had known the Lord, fled from persecution in Syria to\r\nthe mouth of the Rhone about A.D. 40. Up to the XI century the Christian\r\nworld had accepted Ephesus as the burial place of the Magdalene, and the\r\ntomb of Lazarus was claimed by Cyprus. In 899 the Emperor Leo VI had\r\nremoved both bodies to Constantinople, where he built a church for them.\r\nNot a trace of the tradition concerning the Bethany sisters and brother\r\nis to be found in France before Vézelay monastery claimed the possession\r\nof the relics of the Magdalene and dedicated its church to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Vézelay's XII-century Abbey Church of the Madeleine_]\r\n\r\nThe founder of Vézelay freed its abbot of the control of local bishop or\r\nbaron by establishing him as feudal proprietor of the town. The result\r\nwas that the history of the abbey was a stormy one. The neighboring\r\nproprietors, resenting the abbot's independence, excited against him the\r\ntownspeople who had grown rich from the fairs held during the\r\npilgrimages. The burghers chafed at their serfdom to the monastery, and\r\nin 1106, during riots, they murdered Abbot Artaud. He probably was the\r\nbuilder of the Romanesque choir to which was originally attached the\r\nactual nave, since there is record of a dedication ceremony at Vézelay\r\nin 1104. As the archives were burned by the Calvinists in 1560, no\r\nprecise dates exist for the church, but M. Lefèvre-Pontalis thinks that\r\nthe crypt under the choir is of Abbot Artaud's time.\r\n\r\nA fire in which hundreds perished occurred in 1120. The present nave\r\ncould not have been in use before then. When it was completed the\r\nbuilders proceeded to erect a forechurch of three bays, and between it\r\nand the nave was opened the famous portico which has been called worthy\r\nof Paradise. Innocent II, in 1132, blessed the new parts of the\r\nabbatial. He had lately consecrated the cathedral of Piacenza, and at\r\nPavia in that same year was blessed San Pietro-in-Ciel-d'Ore. North and\r\nsouth of the Alps the same energies were astir, but no sculpture of that\r\nperiod in Italy equals that of Vézelay. The date of the imaged portal of\r\nFerrara Cathedral is 1135, and that of St. Zeno at Verona, 1183.\r\n\r\nThe nave at Vézelay had no triforium, nor was there a tribune over the\r\naisles. However, in the narthex they built upper galleries, under whose\r\nlean-to roof was concealed a quarter-circle wall that did the work of a\r\ncontinuous flying buttress. The principal span was still further\r\ncounterbutted by the side aisles themselves. Over the easternmost bay of\r\nthe narthex appeared a vault section with Gothic ribs, but the diagonals\r\nwere more decorative than functional; the vault web of rubble in a bed\r\nof mortar was molded on a temporary frame like a groin vault. Pointed\r\narches were employed in the main arcade of the forechurch.\r\n\r\nVézelay's capitals rivet attention, so dramatic are the Bible stories\r\nrelated--the suicide of Judas, David and Goliath, Absalom, Moses, some\r\nsymbolized vices and virtues, too, and a few _genre_ studies. The\r\ncapital of the fifth pier on the north side of the nave shows field\r\nlaborers who carry cones which some say were used for scattering grain,\r\nand others think were for the vintage, or for honey-gathering; the same\r\nagricultural scene was represented at Cluny. Vézelay even ornamented\r\nwith sculpture some of the bases of its piers.\r\n\r\nThe triple doors between narthex and nave are a supreme work. At the\r\nmiddle trumeau stands John the Baptist, he who was sent before to\r\nprepare the way, the announcer as well as the witness. On the disk which\r\nhe holds was once carved the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the\r\nworld. Observe that the trumeau was made narrow at its base, in order to\r\nlet pass the pilgrim throngs. At each side of the door stand a few\r\napostles, and among them M. Viollet-le-Duc cited St. Peter as one of the\r\nearliest attempts to escape the stereotyped Byzantine models by\r\nportraying individual expression in imagery.\r\n\r\nIn the tympanum is the Pentecost, or perhaps it may be called more\r\nexactly the Messiah's mandate to the apostles: Go, teach all nations.\r\nChrist is surrounded by a gloria, and the Greek cross of his nimbus\r\nsymbolizes divinity. From his outstretched hands spread rays which touch\r\nthe head of each apostle. The explanations of the lintel stone have been\r\nvarious. It would seem to represent the strange peoples of the world to\r\nbe won by Gospel preaching. Around the tympanum are eight medallions,\r\nthought to interpret John the Evangelist and the seven churches of Asia\r\nhe exhorted.\r\n\r\nIn 1136 an Auvergne noble, Pons de Montboissier, became abbot of Vézelay\r\n(d. 1161), when the forechurch was practically finished, but without\r\ndoubt while its statuary was in progress, for certain uncut sides of the\r\ncapitals prove that the stones were set up in the rough and carved _in\r\nsitu_. Under Abbot Pons, Vézelay emancipated itself from Cluniac rule.\r\nHe was the brother of Peter the Venerable of Cluny, who had become prior\r\nof Vézelay at twenty years of age. In vain the amenable Peter counseled\r\nPons to show a more conciliatory spirit toward the restless townsmen,\r\nbut Pons was as stubbornly convinced of the righteousness of his\r\nmonastery's privileges as is many a modern landlord who holds vast areas\r\namong the unlanded millions. He held a stiff head against popular\r\ndemands, the trouble grew aggravated, and the embittered burghers passed\r\nbeyond their first fair demands and compromised their cause. Abbot Pons\r\nwas driven out, but returned a victor after Louis VII had investigated\r\nthe case and imposed a heavy fine on the citizens. Some have thought\r\nthat the penalty money was expended on the elaborate sculptures of the\r\nabbey church. The people might oppose their feudal master, but they were\r\naware that their material prosperity came from the pilgrimage church of\r\nthe monastery, and each Burgundian was proud to show the visiting\r\nstrangers the region's exceptional ability in stonecutting.\r\n\r\nIn Vézelay occurred two notable gatherings of mediæval history. Here, on\r\nMarch 31, 1146, St. Bernard preached the Second Crusade, on the hillside\r\nwithout the northern gate. Abbot Pons built on the site the chapel of\r\nthe Holy Cross, wherein was preserved the tribune on which the saint had\r\nstood. The leaders of France flocked into this valley of Burgundy, Louis\r\nVII and his brilliant queen, Aliénor of Aquitaine.[294]\r\n\r\nSt. Bernard had been commissioned by the pope to set the new venture in\r\nmotion, and he threw his whole passionate heart into the enterprise.\r\nStanding above the vast gathering, he read the papal letter that told of\r\nOdessa's fall, two years earlier, and the horrifying massacre of eastern\r\nChristians. It was sound statesmanship that discerned the menace of the\r\nEastern Question; the advance of the Seljukian Turk was indeed a knotty\r\nproblem for the XII century, when XX-century Europe, after oceans of\r\nblood, has not settled the trouble. We may be sure that Bernard of\r\nClairvaux used no flatteries in addressing the throng at Vézelay, if his\r\npublic word was as uncompromising as his private letters: \"Up! soldier\r\nof Christ! Go, expiate your sins! The breath of corruption is on every\r\nside. The license of manners is unchecked. Brigandage goes unpunished.\r\n_Debout, soldats du Christ!_\" We know that his words of flame swept the\r\ncrowd, and that, as at Clermont, fifty years earlier, again rose the\r\ncry: \"God wills it! The Cross! The Cross!\" The seductive queen, whose\r\nequivocal conduct on this very crusade was to start centuries of\r\ncalamity for France, threw herself at Bernard's feet, to receive from\r\nhis hand the Cross. The lowly people jostled with the lords to take the\r\nvow, \"_les menues gens et les gens de grand air_,\" for crusades were\r\ndemocratic things that did more than aught else to break up feudal\r\nautocracy.\r\n\r\nThe eager men and women of 1146 knelt in the actual nave and narthex of\r\nVézelay's abbatial. The choir which we have to-day was not yet built. In\r\n1165 a fire damaged the choir of the Madeleine. A year later the exiled\r\narchbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, excommunicated his enemies in\r\nEngland from Vézelay's pulpit. The new choir was built mainly under\r\nAbbot Girard d'Arcy (1171-96), and is Burgundy's Primary Gothic, though\r\na generation behind the work of that phase in the Ile-de-France.\r\nUnpracticed hands made its vaulting, whose web is not built elastically\r\nas in the true Gothic fashion; the stones were welded in a compact mass\r\nby a bath of mortar. Viollet-le-Duc suggested that Abbot Hugues, deposed\r\nby the pope in 1206 for indebtedness, may have expended more than he\r\nshould on the church.\r\n\r\nThe choir was well advanced when, in July of 1191, the second great\r\ngathering at Vézelay occurred. Here Philippe-Auguste and Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion met, swore eternal friendship, and then marched south\r\ntogether for the Third Crusade. Before ever they reached Palestine their\r\npact of good will was broken, as was only to be expected with the virus\r\nof the Capet-Angevin duel in their veins. Richard's mother, Aliénor, had\r\nflouted Philippe's father, her first husband, on the former great\r\nenterprise for the East which had been initiated at Vézelay. The\r\nMadeleine church reconstructed its west frontispiece in the XIII\r\ncentury in order to light better its narthex; the pignon is overheavy\r\nand rather odd.\r\n\r\nThree times St. Louis came to pray in the famous Burgundian pilgrim\r\nchurch, his last visit being a few months before his death while\r\ncrusading in Africa. Then, in Provence in 1279, was discovered what was\r\nclaimed to be the real body of the Magdalene. Before the XIII century\r\nwas ended the prestige of Vézelay's pilgrimages was a thing of the past.\r\nThe monastery's ruin was consummated during the religious wars.[295]\r\nSuch was the decrepitude into which the splendid church fell, that only\r\na complete restoration by Viollet-le-Duc, from 1840 to 1858, saved the\r\nedifice from collapse.\r\n\r\nBecause Vézelay's nave belongs to Burgundy's school of Romanesque it is\r\nspacious and amply lighted; no gloom, no cramping here. Such a nave\r\ncould lead up to a Gothic choir, without sharp contrast. The choir,\r\ntaken by itself, may be a cold work, but the sublimity of its setting\r\nplaces it beyond criticism. There is no more romantically ideal a vista\r\nin architecture than the white choir of Vézelay, as it appears from the\r\nnarthex through the imaged portico. Seen thus down the prospect of the\r\nsober nave four hundred feet away, it rises like the crusaders' dream of\r\nthe Heavenly Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe dominant note of Vézelay's interior is serenity. Pace up and down\r\nits deserted aisles as a warm June day fades. The rose glow of sunset\r\ntransmutes the coarse, porous stones to glory and the church seems\r\nvoicing, _securo e gaudioso_, the grand old plain-chant psalmody which\r\nthrough long centuries echoed here. With you, like a tangible presence,\r\nis Faith's certitude, the certitude of John the Baptist who witnessed,\r\nthe vision of John the Evangelist who loved, the impassioned\r\ntranquillity of Mary of Magdala. Here reigns the benignant gladness,\r\n_benigna letizia_, that Dante attributes to St. Bernard in Paradise. The\r\nluminous stillness of Vézelay testifies that he that cometh to God must\r\nbelieve that He is. Here Faith is an overwhelming acquiescence of the\r\nconscience as entire as was the belief of the men and women of the XII\r\ncentury who, when they heard the preacher's word, responded with the\r\ncry: \"The Cross! The Cross!\" In the solitary abbatial of to-day, half\r\nforgotten on a bypath of the world, breathes the living quietude, the\r\nactive repose, the voluntary discipline of its old Benedictine builders.\r\n\"Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of\r\nthings that appear not. Without faith, it is impossible to please God.\"\r\n\r\nLike the Tag, in India, there is here a supersensual art beauty that\r\nrenews the jaded spirit. Both have been embalmed for eternity in a\r\nvivifying peace. \"Without holiness no man shall see God,\" thought the\r\nfaulty, vehement, crusading generations who prayed in Vezelay's church,\r\nand holiness, then, meant primarily the humble repentance of sins.\r\nWhoever it was built the tomb of the Indian princess at Agra, whoever it\r\nwas built the church in Burgundy called after Mary of Magdala, he worked\r\nin something more than stones and mortar. At Agra you end by thinking\r\nthat the secret of the enthralling magic lies in the marvel of\r\natmosphere, the deep soft shadows which break the dazzling sun expanses.\r\nAt Vézelay, in the groping effort to put its spell into words, you end\r\nby saying that the beauty lies in the space which the inclosing walls\r\nhave so holily shut in. But what analysis or what detailed description\r\ncan convey how the spirit is impressed by this shrine, named for the\r\nSinner who poured out the precious ointment with a Faith and Love so\r\ncomplete that it washed her clean!\r\n\r\nIn such a church come flashes of insight, momentary liftings of the\r\nveil, periods of mental fecundity that make clear why the true mystic\r\npasses without loss from his isolated reverie of Divine Love to an\r\nintensely practical activity, and when you begin to understand that you\r\nare on the way to a comprehensive sympathy with that pillar of French\r\nChristianity, that apostle sent of God as surely as was Paul to the\r\nGentiles--Bernard the Burgundian, who prayed and preached in this abbey\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHIC COLLEGIATE AT SEMUR-EN-AUXOIS[296]\r\n\r\n     Les Français, fils ainés de l'antiquité, Romain par le génie, sont\r\n     Grec par le caractère. Inquiets et volages dans le bonheur;\r\n     constant et invincibles dans l'aversité; formés pour les arts;\r\n     civilisés jusqu'à l'excès durant le calme de l'État; grossiers et\r\n     sauvages dans les troubles politiques; flottants comme des\r\n     vaisseaux sans lest au gré des passions; enthusiastes du bien et du\r\n     mal; aimants pusillanimes de la vie pendant la paix; prodigues de\r\n     leur jours dans les batailles; charmants dans leur pays;\r\n     insupportable chez l'étranger; tels furent les Athéniens\r\n     d'autrefois, tels sont les Français d'aujourd'hui.--CHATEAUBRIAND.\r\n\r\nIf the traveler has chosen little Avallon as the center from which to\r\nexplore Burgundian churches, Semur-en-Auxois, lying a few miles to its\r\neast, will soon be visited. Picturesque and well kept, it is perched on\r\na crest round which loops the river, a site such as a feudal baron\r\nchose, when possible, for his lair. The donjon towers at Semur belonged\r\nto a fortress built by Duke Philippe le Hardi.\r\n\r\nThe collegiate church of Notre Dame, included with the best Gothic work\r\nin Burgundy, derived indirectly from the choir of Auxerre Cathedral,\r\nthrough the church of Our Lady at Dijon. About 1225 the builders began\r\nto replace the XI-century Notre Dame at Semur by the present edifice,\r\nwhich reproduced the columnal piers with salient crockets that\r\ndistinguish the most beautiful of Dijon's churches. By 1250 they had\r\nterminated the choir, transept, and the bay of the nave touching the\r\ntransept. The nave and transept are too narrow for their height, because\r\nthey followed the same ground plan as the antecedent Romanesque church.\r\nBurgundy seemed to enjoy a problem in construction. Here, the arches of\r\nthe vault being excessively pointed, the flying buttresses were made\r\nwith a radius greater than is to be found elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEarly in the XIV century, three new bays were added to the nave, as is\r\nshown by their main arches, which are more pointed than those of the\r\nearlier bays. Then about 1370, probably after a fire, the nave's stone\r\nroof was rebuilt and its triforium suppressed. The religious wars of the\r\nXVI century played havoc here in Notre Dame. During the Revolution, for\r\ntwo entire weeks, cartload after cartload of art treasures was carried\r\naway from the collegiate. Happily, the transept's northern portal\r\nescaped destruction, for it is a small masterpiece of Burgundian\r\nsculpture. Its tympanum relates the adventures in India of St. Thomas\r\nthe Apostle, whose builder's rule was said to be of gold, in emblem of\r\nhis spiritual masoncraft. St. Jerome would not sanction the Indian\r\nlegends of the architect apostle, but the story of King Goldoforus and\r\nSt. Thomas lingered in popular favor.\r\n\r\nIn one of the chapels of Semur's collegiate church is a XIV-century\r\nwindow dedicated to no saint, telling no Scriptural story, but merely\r\nsetting forth, in large, clear panels, the working day of various\r\nartisans--dyer, vintager, butcher, tailor. The theologians who directed\r\nthe iconography of mediæval churches permitted the old guildsmen to\r\ntranslate into sign language their sensible idea that honest work was\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nThe keystone over the sanctuary of Notre Dame, where eight ribs meet, is\r\nthe most beautiful ever carved--a Coronation of the Virgin. Throughout\r\nthe church the sculpture is exceptional. In the choir and transept,\r\ncarved heads lean out from the triforium's spandrels, heads of monarch,\r\nbishop, monk, nun, and chatelaine, with here and there a grinning mask\r\nor grotesque. The restorer has followed a wrong path when he makes the\r\nexaggerated images in XIII-century sculpture exceed the ideal or\r\nrealistic ones. Semur's triforium is among the most beautiful in Gothic\r\nart. On some of the capitals of the collegiate are vintage scenes, as\r\nwas natural in this land of famous wines. There are noted modern\r\nvineyards, such as Chambertin and Vougeot, which were cultivated by the\r\nmonks of Cluny and Cîteaux for many a long century.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF AUXERRE[297]\r\n\r\n    J'erre à pas muets dans ce profond asile,\r\n    Solitude de pierre, immuable, immobile,\r\n    Image du séjour par Dieu même habité,\r\n    Où tout est profondeur, mystère, éternité ...\r\n    La voix du clocher en son doux s'évapore;\r\n    Et, le front appuyé, contre un pilier sonore,\r\n    Je le sens, tout ému du retentissement,\r\n    Vibrer comme une clef d'un céleste instrument ...\r\n    Les rayons du soir que l'Occident rappelle,\r\n    Éteignent au vitraux leur dernière étincelle,\r\n    Au fond du sanctuaire un feu flottant qui luit,\r\n    Scintille comme un oeil ouvert sur cette nuit;\r\n    Alors, portant mes yeux des pavés à la voûte\r\n    Je sens que dans ce vide une oreille m'écoute,\r\n    Qu'un invisible ami dans la nef répandu,\r\n    M'attire à lui, me parle un langage entendu,\r\n    Se communique à moi dans un silence intime\r\n    Et dans son vaste sein m'enveloppe et m'abîme.\r\n    --LAMARTINE (1790-1869; born in Burgundy).\r\n\r\nAt Auxerre, on the Yonne, two Gothic edifices stand imposingly above the\r\ncity, the cathedral of St. Stephen and the abbatial church named after\r\nthat bishop of Auxerre, St. Germain, who foretold the sanctity of _la\r\npucellette_ Geneviève in the village of Nanterre by Paris, and whose own\r\nsanctity was so assured that more churches have been called for him than\r\nfor any other saint of France save the supreme St. Martin himself.\r\nParis put her church of St. Germain l'Auxerrois under his protection. He\r\nhad been the ruler of this region of middle France under the Emperor\r\nHonorius, and was a soldier and devoted to sports; yet the old bishop of\r\nAuxerre, St. Amâtre, chose him as his successor, divining in him a man\r\ndestined to do great things for God.\r\n\r\nThe splendid abbey church at Auxerre stands on the site of the oratory\r\nwhich rose over the grave of St. Germain. Queen Clotilde on her way to\r\nwed Clovis, pausing here in 490, renewed the shrine by a church, which\r\nbecame the nucleus for an abbey favored by all three dynasties of\r\nFrance--Merovingian, Carolingian, and Capetian.[298] The monastery was a\r\nnoted school whither came St. Patrick, and many generations later St.\r\nThomas Becket studied here after he had finished his law courses at\r\nBologna.\r\n\r\nIn memory of Auxerre's reputation as a teacher, the cathedral has twice\r\nrepresented the Liberal Arts, in glass and in sculpture. The choir of\r\nSt. Étienne Cathedral was begun about 1215 by a well-known schoolman,\r\nBishop Guillaume de Seignelay, who undertook it at his own expense,\r\nstimulated thereto by some of the parish churches which had lately been\r\nrebuilt in the new way. The crypt (c. 1130), retained under the choir of\r\nthe new cathedral, had been begun by the bishop, St. Hugues de Châlons,\r\na friend of St. Bernard, and probably finished by his successor, Hugues\r\nde Mâcon (1137-51), the first abbot of Pontigny, and St. Bernard's\r\nkinsman and childhood intimate. Of the cathedral of their day only the\r\npresent crypt remains.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop Guillaume de Seignelay was transferred to the see of Paris,\r\nin 1220, he worked on the west façade of Notre Dame of the capital, and\r\nhis successor at Auxerre, Henri de Villeneuve, completed the choir of\r\nSt. Étienne in 1234. Two lancets in the sanctuary are his gifts. The\r\ncathedral of Auxerre was building at both ends, while between lay the\r\nancient Romanesque nave. The easternmost bay of the nave is XIII\r\ncentury, but the next five bays were erected only during the XIV\r\ncentury, at which time most of the statues of the western portals were\r\ndone. With the choir's superb stained glass they form the supreme\r\naccessory of this cathedral. M. Enlart holds Auxerre's imagery to be,\r\nfor delicacy and charm, among the best produced by the XIV century, and\r\nthat the statuettes of the Liberal Arts, in the spandrels over the\r\ncanopies of the David-Balthazar groups, are equal to Greek terra-cotta\r\nfigurines. The Judgment of Solomon by the northwest door is excellent.\r\nWithin and without the stonecutting of the transept's southern façade\r\nshould be observed. At that entrance appeared an early example of an\r\naccoladed arch, cited by M. Enlart as an indication of the English\r\nderivation of Flamboyant Gothic in France, since during the XIV century\r\nthey were masters of Auxerre for a time.\r\n\r\nAs the Hundred Years' War relaxed building enterprise, the nave was not\r\ncovered by a masonry roof till the XV century, about the time when\r\nJeanne d'Arc paused to pray in Auxerre Cathedral on her memorable\r\njourney of eleven days from Lorraine to Touraine, across a France\r\nravaged by civil and foreign wars.[299] The gracious Flamboyant west\r\nfront of Auxerre's chief church is an expression of the hope and\r\nnational pride renewed in France by the Maid's feat at Orléans. The\r\nwell-designed north tower proves that the final phase of Gothic art in\r\nFrance did not pass away in decrepitude; had only the south tower been\r\nraised above the roof, this frontispiece could claim foremost rank.\r\n\r\nFor bold and light construction Auxerre's choir is notable, and it made\r\na school in Burgundian Gothic. It has only one radiating chapel--that in\r\nthe axis--because it followed the ground plan of the Romanesque crypt,\r\nits foundation. The charming Champagne disposition of planting columns\r\nbetween chapel and ambulatory was made use of; perhaps the pillars and\r\nstilted arches of Auxerre are rather too frail in their proportions. The\r\nsame feature was used in the abbey church of St. Germain, and when the\r\nchurch of St. Eusèbe[300] rebuilt its chevet, in the XV century, pillars\r\nwere again placed to divide the curving aisle and the radiating chapels.\r\n\r\nAuxerre Cathedral showed another trait of the Champagne school of\r\nGothic--an interior passageway beneath the aisle windows. The plain wall\r\nbelow it is relieved by a kind of arched corbel course not very\r\nsatisfactory; the arches and the capitals upon which they rest are\r\npresent, but there is no shaft to support the capitals, from above each\r\nof which reaches out a well-sculptured head. One of these busts\r\nrepresents the Erythræan priestess referred to in the _Dies iræ_:\r\n\r\n    That day of wrath, that dreadful day,\r\n    When Heaven and Earth shall pass away,\r\n    As David and the Sibyl say.\r\n\r\nThe XIII century distinguished only that one sibyl whom St. Augustine's\r\n_City of God_ had popularized as the prophetess of the Last Judgment,\r\nbut later in the Middle Ages all ten of them were represented, and\r\ncertain Renaissance windows represented as many as twelve pagan\r\nprophetesses.\r\n\r\nThe placing of sculptured heads in the spandrels of arches was not\r\ninfrequent in Burgundy, though occasionally merely one salient crocket\r\nwas used. The cathedral of Nevers,[301] south of Auxerre, went a step\r\nfarther and chiseled a small figurine in the spandrels of its triforium,\r\nlike the angels of Lincoln's choir. Moreover, the colonettes of Nevers'\r\ntriforium are borne on the backs of small crouching caryatides--a\r\nLombard echo. In France, Nevers' cathedral of St. Cyr was exceptional in\r\nhaving an apse at both east and west ends, like a Rhenish church. One is\r\nforced to relegate the beautiful little capital of the Nivermois to a\r\nfootnote, which is what France herself seems to be doing to the well-set\r\ntown on the Loire which in England or beyond the Rhine would be made\r\ninto a small residence city. Its palace, parks, cathedral, and numerous\r\nchurches, its faïence industry and fortifications give it the air of a\r\nlittle capital.\r\n\r\nAuxerre is another Mecca of stained glass in France. Its choir possesses\r\nalmost forty windows (1220-30) of the school of Chartres, half of them\r\nbeing in the ambulatory and Lady chapel. Unfortunately, the lower\r\npanels were wrecked in 1567, and the east window of the axis chapel was\r\ndestroyed in the Franco-Prussian war; the grisaille design throughout is\r\nmastery. The opaline loveliness of the choir's clearstory grisaille has\r\ndrawn from M. Viollet-le-Duc one of his most eloquent pages.[302] Each\r\nbay is filled with twin lancets surmounted by a rose; each lancet has a\r\nlarge figure set in uncolored glass--one of the first attempts made to\r\ngive more light to an interior. Those crusading generations visioned\r\ntheir Heavenly Jerusalem in sculpture at Vézelay, in color at Auxerre:\r\n\r\n    With jaspers glow thy bulwarks,\r\n      Thy streets with emeralds blaze,\r\n    The sardius and the topaz\r\n      Unite in thee their rays:\r\n    Thine ageless walls are bonded\r\n      With amethyst unpriced;\r\n    The saints build up its fabric,\r\n      And the corner stone is Christ.\r\n\r\n    They stand, those halls of Zion,\r\n      Conjubilant with song,\r\n    And bright with many an angel,\r\n      And all the martyr throng:\r\n    The Prince is ever in them;\r\n      Their daylight is serene,\r\n    The pastures of the blessed\r\n      Are decked in glorious sheen.\r\n\r\n    There is the throne of David,\r\n      And there, from care released,\r\n    The song of them that triumph,\r\n       The shout of them that feast;\r\n    And they who, with their leader,\r\n      Have conquered in the fight,\r\n    For ever and for ever\r\n      Are clad in robes of white.[303]\r\n\r\nIn the roses of the two bays neighboring the central lancets are the\r\nLiberal Arts and virtues contrasted with vices. The choir aisle has a\r\nCreation window, and lancets of the popular St. James, St. Nicolas, and\r\nSt. Eustace. The transept's south rose is Rayonnant. Its north one is\r\nFlamboyant, and with the eight golden lights below it was given by\r\nBishop François de Dinteville, the younger (1530-52), who donated also\r\nthe _Gloria in Excelsis_ west rose. But no sooner were all these\r\nprecious things installed when came the bitter civil wars of the XVI\r\ncentury. No place in France suffered more than Auxerre. An eyewitness of\r\nthe 1567 sacking wrote: \"All the woes of Jerusalem when it fell to the\r\ninfidel are heaped on our city.\" Many a citizen died of grief at the\r\ntown's desolation, and so devastated was every single church that for\r\nmonths no services were held.\r\n\r\nA restoration was accomplished by Bishop Jacques Amyot (1571-93), the\r\nnoted Hellenist, who first brought flexibility and amenity into French\r\nprose.[304] His translation of Plutarch--a French classic--molded the\r\nideals of French youth for generations. Unfortunately, because imported\r\nforeign taste had won the victory over the national art, this\r\nenlightened Renaissance prelate removed some of the ancient windows to\r\nlight his high altar. His marble bust adorns a pier of the choir of\r\nAuxerre Cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIJON[305]\r\n\r\n    Eternal, je me tais; en ta sainte présence\r\n    Je n'ose respirer, et mon âme en silence\r\n      Admire la hauteur de ton nom glorieux.\r\n    Que dirai-je? Abîmés de cette mer profonde,\r\n    Pendant qu'à l'infini ta clarté nous inonde,\r\n      Pouvons-nous seulement ouvrir nos faibles yeux?\r\n\r\n                     * * *\r\n\r\n    Cessez: qu'espérez-vous de vos incertitudes,\r\n    Vains pensers, vains efforts, inutiles études?\r\n      C'est assez qu'il ait dit: \"Je suis Celui qui suis.\"\r\n    Il est tout, il n'est rien de tout ce que je pense;\r\n    Avec ces mots profonds j'adore son essence\r\n      Et sans y raisonner, en croyant, je poursuis!\r\n   --BOSSUET, _Tibi silentium laus_ (1627-1704; born in Dijon).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Notre Dame at Dijon (1220-1245). Burgundian Gothic_]\r\n\r\nAnd finally we come to the capital of Burgundy, to a city of prime\r\nimportance in the art history of France, although it can claim no one\r\nsupreme monument. Dijon's leadership was from 1364 to 1477, under the\r\nfour art-loving Valois princes, Philippe le Hardi (1364-1404), Jean sans\r\nPeur (1404-19), Philippe le Bon (1419-67), and Charles le Téméraire\r\n(1467-77). \"Never,\" says Brantôme, \"were there four greater princes one\r\nafter the other than the great dukes of Burgundy.\" Each in turn on\r\nhis formal entry into Dijon came to the abbey church of St. Bénigne to\r\ntake oath to defend the special privileges of his capital. Tradition\r\nsays that St. Benignus was sent to Christianize Gaul by St. Polycarp,\r\nwho had known John the Evangelist. The hypothesis is possible, since it\r\nis historically certain that Polycarp provided Lyons with its first two\r\nbishops. Many a son of Dijon has borne the revered name of Bénigne, none\r\nwith greater honor for his native city than Bossuet, descended from\r\nancient parliamentary stock. The neo-classic taste of the great\r\npreacher's day might prevent his knowing Gothic architecture rightly,\r\nbut without the centuries that built mediæval cathedrals he had not been\r\nwhat he was.[306]\r\n\r\nDijon became the capital of Burgundy under the first line of Capetian\r\ndukes who governed the province from 1032 to 1361 and who gave the city\r\nits franchise and privileges. A duke of Burgundy led the right wing at\r\nBouvines, another fought under St. Louis at Mansourah. From Burgundy's\r\nreigning line came Pope Calixtus II (1119-24), whose brother went\r\ncrusading in Spain, where he founded the house from which descended\r\nQueen Isabella; Burgundian Capetians also reigned in Portugal. Cluny and\r\nCîteaux were favored by the first line of Burgundy's dukes, to which\r\nbelonged, by ties of blood, the two greatest abbots of their respective\r\nOrders, St. Hugues and St. Bernard. In 1361 the last duke died childless\r\nand the duchy returned to the French crown.\r\n\r\nThree years later the Valois Capetian king, Jean le Bon, gave Burgundy\r\nto his youngest and favorite son, Philippe le Hardi, who won his surname\r\nof valiant when fifteen years of age through his defense of his father\r\nat the battle of Poitiers. When Philippe, by the generous aid of his\r\nbrother, King Charles V, wedded the richest heiress in Europe, the very\r\nplain Marguerite of Flanders, there resulted the political union of\r\nBurgundy with the Netherlands that was of important influence on French\r\nart. It led to the formation at Dijon of a French-Flemish school of\r\nsculpture. The robust middle region of France impressed its own\r\ncharacter on the masters from the Lowlands who flocked to the semi-royal\r\ncourt of the dukes, and equally it assimilated the artists who came from\r\nLyons and neighboring regions. The Flemish-Burgundian style controlled\r\nthe first half of the XV century. Its fusion of national and local art\r\ntraditions with Flemish realism renewed the vigor of French sculpture,\r\nand a truly French Renaissance had already set in before the advent of\r\nthe Italian spirit. In Dijon took place the evolution that changed the\r\nsculpture of the Middle Ages to that of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe artists who had gathered around Charles V in Paris, were scattered\r\nby that king's premature death and the subsequent disorders in the royal\r\ndomain, and they flocked to the Burgundian court of his brother. Among\r\nthem were André and Guy de Dammartin, who erected outside the gates of\r\nDijon the Chartreuse of Champmol (1388-96) as a burial place for the\r\nValois line of dukes. The work of the Dammartin family--with whom\r\nFlamboyant Gothic became a heritage passing from father to son--can be\r\nfound at Bourges, Poitiers, Tours, Le Mans, and Nantes.\r\n\r\nWhat parts of the Chartreuse monastery now remain constitute an asylum.\r\nThe sculptured portal of the church shows kneeling images of Philippe le\r\nHardi and his duchess Marguerite, and in the cloister is the noted Well\r\nof the Prophets, conceived, and in part executed, by Claus Sluter in\r\n1395, and finished by his nephew, Claus de Werve, in 1403. The _Puits de\r\nMoïse_ was so called because the statue of Moses, alone of the six\r\nprophets, shows religious analogy with the biblical character it stands\r\nfor. The others are realistic studies of tradesman, rich citizen, or\r\nJew, in eccentric costumes that probably were copied from those in the\r\nmystery plays of the day. With these prophet images of Claus Sluter,\r\nmodern sculpture took birth.\r\n\r\nThe two most regal tombs of the Middle Ages, those of Philippe le Hardi\r\nand his son Jean sans Peur, were originally in the Chartreuse church,\r\nbut were broken up by the Revolution. They were reset, for a time, in\r\nSt. Bénigne's church, and now are installed in the XV-century guard hall\r\nof the ducal palace, a part of Dijon's Art Museum, raising that\r\ncollection to first-class rank. Near them are placed the elaborately\r\ncarved and painted altarpieces brought from Termonde by the dukes. The\r\npomp and pageantry of the knighthood described by Froissart and Commines\r\nbreathes in the two grandiose tombs of Dijon, and the progeny of\r\nsumptuous funereal monuments they inspired. Cowled figures called\r\n_pleureurs_ are set in niches around each sarcophagus. They seem like\r\nsymbols of the lesser people's sufferings in the dire Hundred Years'\r\nWar, when France became a field of carnage. Foreign invasion, the Great\r\nSchism of the West, pest, massacres, misrule, lawlessness--such was the\r\naccumulation of miseries that only the heaven-sent Jehanne la Pucelle,\r\nfrom the far borders of the land, could right the immeasurable _pitié_\r\nthere was in the kingdom of France.\r\n\r\nThough Burgundy suffered less than the royal domain, the lesser people\r\nhad to pay heavily for the prodigal largess of their dukes. At times the\r\nlavish giving of Philippe le Hardi bordered upon folly; while on visits\r\nof state he was forced to put his jewels in pawn to obtain sufficient\r\nfunds for his home journey. When he died, in 1404, it took six weeks for\r\nhis funeral _cortège_ to journey from Brussels to Dijon, and those of\r\nhis household who accompanied the body were provided with Capuchin capes\r\nof black cloth. That is the procession represented by the statuettes\r\naround his sarcophagus, though, unfortunately, the original order of\r\ntheir march has been lost. Among the eighty _pleurants_ of the two ducal\r\ntombs are only eight restorations.\r\n\r\nJean de Marville, a Lorraine master, designed Duke Philippe's monument,\r\nwhose imagery is in greater part from the hand of Claus Sluter and Claus\r\nde Werve, Netherlanders (1384-1411). De Werve made most of Duke Jean's\r\nmonument, a replica of his father's tomb; it was finished by an\r\nAragonese sculptor, Juan de Heurta, and Antoine le Moiturier from\r\nAvignon. The latter was nephew of Jacques Morel of Lyons, trained in the\r\nDijon studios, who made for the daughter of John the Fearless, the\r\nDuchess of Bourbon, a tomb in Souvigny's abbatial near Moulins, which M.\r\nEnlart has called the most masterly work in sculpture of the XV century.\r\n\r\nDijon built no XIII-century cathedral. What to-day is its cathedral was\r\noriginally the abbey church of St. Bénigne, not of architectural\r\npre-eminence, but rich in historic memories. Abbot Hugues d'Arcy began\r\nit in 1280, in the hour of hope and energy that followed on the Council\r\nof Lyons, where Greek and Latin churches fraternally united. In 1286 the\r\nchoir was dedicated and the relics of St. Benignus transferred from the\r\ncrypt to the new sanctuary.\r\n\r\nSt. Bénigne of Dijon is a secondary church compared with its neighbors,\r\nthe cathedrals of Bourges and Lyons. The profiles are emasculated, the\r\nclearstory windows lack sufficient height, the wall surface above the\r\ntriforium is monotonous, the denuded triforium of the nave lacks\r\ncapitals, and despite the warm brown color of the stone, the general\r\naspect of the interior is glacial. The Gothic effect has been marred\r\nfurther by the numerous busts and statues brought here from other\r\nchurches after the Revolution.\r\n\r\nFar surpassing in interest the somewhat pinchbeck Gothic upper church of\r\nSt. Bénigne is its crypt, the oldest Romanesque monument in Burgundy. It\r\nlies beyond the actual apse. For eight hundred years it was the\r\nfoundation of a rotunda church of the same type as the round church at\r\nCambridge, England, the prototypes for both being certain Roman\r\nmausoleums. Originally the Dijon crypt opened westward on a crypt now\r\nlost--the basement for a Latin cross church--and where that juncture\r\noccurred are vestiges of buildings that antedate the actual crypt. The\r\nround church beyond the apse of St. Bénigne's Gothic abbatial was\r\ndestroyed during the Revolution, and its crypt filled in and forgotten.\r\nIn 1858, while digging foundations for a new sacristy beyond the choir,\r\nthe circular chamber was unearthed, in which was found a tombstone,\r\napparently the ancient one of St. Benignus. Once again the venerable\r\nsubterranean shrine became a pilgrimage for Burgundy.\r\n\r\nSt. Bénigne's crypt has double circular aisles. Its sculpture is rude,\r\neven amorphous, and testifies to the extinction of the art during the\r\nBarbarians' immigrations. These rough designs on the capitals of St.\r\nBénigne are, as it were, the first stutterings of the national pæans in\r\npraise of God and country that are the imaged portals of Gothic\r\ncathedrals.\r\n\r\nAbbot William of Volpiano, who made St. Bénigne's Romanesque rotunda and\r\nits adjacent basilica, came from Cluny to reform the spiritual life of\r\nthe Dijon monastery and rebuild its church. Born on an island in the\r\nlake of Orta, he had crossed the Alps with Abbot Majolus of Cluny. For\r\nover thirty years he exercised his double function of administrative\r\nreformer and architect in Burgundy[307] and in Normandy, introducing\r\ncertain Lombard features such as alternating piers, arched corbel\r\ncourses, and superimposed arcades for decorative effect, this latter\r\nbeing a Ravennate motive adopted by Lombardy. He began his two\r\nconnecting churches at Dijon in 1001, and completed them in 1018, when\r\nthere was a solemn dedication at which St. William preached most\r\nmovingly. St. Bénigne is, therefore, the first-recorded monument built\r\nafter the terrors of the year 1000, described by Raoul Glaber, who lived\r\nin this monastery.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Volpiano founded schools, taught the plain chant to children,\r\nrevised Gregorian music, and established centers for craftsmen. In\r\nmanner he was authoritative, but one on intimate terms with him wrote:\r\n\"No one can tell to what degree in him rose mercy and compassion. In\r\nfamine time, he sold the gold plate of the church to feed the people.\"\r\nTo this day a gateway of Dijon bears his name, the Porte Guillaume.\r\n\r\nA century later Abbot Jarenton of St. Bénigne invited monks from Cluny\r\nto reanimate the spiritual life of his monastery. Paschal II blessed the\r\nDijon abbatial, repaired after the fall of a tower in 1096. When in 1107\r\nAleth de Montbard, mother of St. Bernard, died in her castle two miles\r\nfrom Dijon, Abbot Jarenton hastened out to Fontaine-lès-Dijon to claim\r\nthe body of the saintly woman for his hallowed crypt of St. Bénigne, and\r\nan enthusiastic procession carried the Blessed Aleth to the city. St.\r\nBernard was an unknown lad at the time.\r\n\r\nIn 1131, Pope Eugene III blessed the Dijon abbatial subsequent to still\r\nother restorations. Finally, in 1271, the easternmost church of William\r\nof Volpiano was wiped out by fire (though his rotunda church was to\r\nstand till 1792), and the present St. Bénigne was begun immediately on\r\nthe site of the destroyed Latin cross basilica.\r\n\r\nIf the ex-abbatial which is now Dijon's cathedral is secondary in size\r\nand character, the parish church of Notre Dame is a veritable gem of\r\nGothic architecture, faultless in construction and of singular purity\r\nand unity. Its influence on the Gothic art of the province was\r\nwidespread. After a fire in 1137, which consumed half the city, a\r\nRomanesque Notre Dame had risen. It was cited, in 1178, as the first of\r\nthe town, its bells sounding the opening and the shutting of the city\r\ngates and alarms for fire.\r\n\r\nThe present church of Notre Dame was begun about 1220; a record referred\r\nto it as in use in 1245. The architect had to contend with difficulties.\r\nHis funds were so small that a minimum of building material was\r\nnecessary. Three sides of his edifice were bounded by public\r\nthoroughfares; hence it was impossible to spread out the piles required\r\nby flying buttresses; at the same time the limited plot of ground made\r\nit imperative not to encumber the small interior by clumsy piers. How to\r\nconstruct a secure edifice without big piers, thick walls, or flying\r\nbuttresses was the problem.\r\n\r\nThe builder showed his genius when he used the inclosure wall to\r\ncounterbut the vault thrust and yet dared open these walls by generous\r\nGothic windows. For ten feet above the ground the walls are heavy; then\r\nthey become a mere shell, skillfully doubled by the use of colonnettes\r\nof durable stone, each slender shaft being so weighted that it stands\r\nwith the security of iron.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Notre Dame appears charmingly spacious and airy. The\r\nXVII century added circular windows to the triforium of the apse, in\r\ncharacter with the church, however. The exterior of the apse is plain\r\nand neat and, with the central lantern tower, composes an architectural\r\ngroup of simple elegance. The eastern buttresses fulfill a triple\r\nfunction as piers, as walls, and as counterbutting members. Technical\r\nsubtlety is to be found throughout Notre Dame. The vaults of the side\r\naisles were constructed to brace the principal span. The piers are\r\nuniform monoliths, but a sexpartite vault was built, though for a\r\ngeneration that system had been discarded in the north. The coping\r\nstones over the capitals of each alternate pier were enlarged to catch\r\nthere the heavier weight.\r\n\r\nThere are so many points of resemblance between Notre Dame of Dijon and\r\nthe choir of Auxerre Cathedral, begun in 1215, that M. Charles Porée has\r\nthought that the same architect designed both. Their profiles are alike,\r\ntheir capitals have similar salient crockets, and their colonnettes were\r\ncut from the quarry according to the rock's horizontal strata, and not\r\nby the usual method of vertical cutting.\r\n\r\nIn boldness of technique the small Dijon church is a masterpiece to\r\nwhich many an eloquent page has been devoted.[308] Beneath an apparent\r\nsimplicity is unsurpassed scientific construction. The great engineer\r\nVauban praised it, as did Soufflot, the XVIII-century architect of the\r\nPanthéon at Paris. The balanced equilibrium of the national art can be\r\ncarried no farther, and only the use of hard Tonnerre stone permitted\r\nthis successful audacity. Were a modern student to present such a plan\r\nto any commission, said M. Lassus, he would be dismissed as mad.\r\n\r\nWhile the nave was building a narthex was added before the western\r\nentrance, consisting of a fifty-foot-deep porch. Notre Dame's west\r\nfaçade rides astride two rows of pillars set close together before the\r\nnarthex, again a case of strength being attained by the able use of\r\ndouble walls. The façade's superimposed arcades, used merely as\r\ndecoration, as at Pisa, prevented the employment of strong buttress\r\nridges, and give to the western front of the church a most un-Gothic\r\naspect. It cannot be said that the lamp of truth is upheld, since the\r\nfrontispiece makes no pretense to express the three-aisled interior, but\r\nrises above the roof like an abstract screen. The gargoyles that\r\nalternate with some ancient superbly cut panels of foliage across the\r\nwest front, date only from 1881, and, as usual with restorations, the\r\ngrotesque element has been overemphasized. A manuscript of the XIII\r\ncentury relates that the original gargoyles were removed when a\r\nbridegroom (a money-lender) about to enter the church was killed by the\r\nfall of a protruding image that represented a man gripping a money bag.\r\n\r\nThe imagery of Notre Dame's portal has been entirely obliterated. When\r\nthe Revolution voted to destroy \"all signs of fanaticism,\" an apothecary\r\nof Dijon mounted a ladder each morning and leveled with his hammer all\r\nthe stonecutters' work. The present image at the trumeau is a fragment\r\nsaved from the late-Gothic Chartreuse of the Valois dukes. To Notre Dame\r\nPhilippe le Hardi gave the Jacquemart[309] clock, one of his spoils from\r\nthe sacking of Courtrai in 1382, whereat he had been assisted by the\r\nDijon citizens _par loyauté et parfait amour_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAINT BERNARD, AND CISTERCIAN INFLUENCE IN GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE[310]\r\n\r\n     What is genius? It is a mind in which imagination, intelligence,\r\n     and feeling exist in an elevated proportion and in an exact\r\n     equation. It is a mind which has a penetrating view of ideas, which\r\n     incarnates them powerfully in marble, in brass, in language, and in\r\n     that dust which we call writing, which also communicates to ideas\r\n     an impulse from the heart to precipitate them, living, into the\r\n     hearts of others. Genius is, with conscience, the most beautiful\r\n     endowment of humanity.... Genius is the greatest power created by\r\n     God for grasping truth. It is a sudden and vast intuition of the\r\n     connections which bind beings together.... It is the faculty of\r\n     rendering ideas visible to those who would not have discovered them\r\n     by themselves, of incarnating them in speaking images, of casting\r\n     them into the soul, enlightening it, subjecting it, thrilling\r\n     it.--LACORDAIRE (1802-61; born in Burgundy).\r\n\r\nAlthough modern Dijon may momentarily blot out much in its past history\r\nby renaming the square before Notre Dame _Place Ernest Renan, auteur de\r\n\"La vie de Jésus\"_ (which work depicts the Saviour as an unconscious\r\ncharlatan), and christening the square before the cathedral _Place\r\nBlanqui, grand Révolutionnaire_ (Blanqui being the Communist who founded\r\nthe journal _Ni Dieu ni Maître_), although it may mark one street sign\r\n_Rue Babeuf, écrivain politique, démocrate très ardente_ (the socialist,\r\nBabeuf, was executed under the Directory), and another with an equal\r\npedantry that is most un-French, _Rue Diderot, auteur principale de\r\nl'Encyclopédie_ (the encyclopedia which railed at the Christian\r\nreligion), none the less will the greatest honor of the ancient capital\r\nof Burgundy be the monk in whom western monasticism culminated, Bernard\r\nof Clairvaux, who led Dante to the Supreme Vision in Paradise, \"who\r\nspoke to kings as a prophet, to the people as their leader, and\r\ntransported Christendom by his eloquence,\" the greatest of Cistercians,\r\nthe greatest of Burgundians, and the last great Doctor of the Church.\r\n\r\nAs the XI century drew to a close, certain pious Benedictines, who\r\nregretted the laxity of rule in their own convent, retired to the marshy\r\nwoods near Beaune, to Cîteaux, some twelve miles south of Dijon. There\r\nwas started a new Order which languished during fifteen years, fever\r\ndecimating the postulants, till the third abbot, St. Stephen Harding,\r\nstormed heaven with petitions to spare his dwindling flock. And\r\nefficacious prayers they appeared to be, for one spring day in 1113\r\nthere came to the abbey gates (Cîteaux' name signifies _Sistite hic_,\r\nHalt here!) a group of thirty young nobles, whose conversion was to set\r\nall Burgundy talking.\r\n\r\nTheir leader was Bernard of Fontaine-lès-Dijon,[311] then in his\r\ntwenty-fourth year. When he experienced the call to a monastic life, he\r\ndrew after him brothers, cousins, uncle, and friends. His mother, the\r\nBlessed Aleth, had impressed ineffaceably on his soul her own ardent\r\nlove of God. As Peter the Venerable said in that same generation: \"With\r\nus the virgin, the wife, the mother, expand the soul of the country by\r\nthe breath of their piety.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the small band of enthusiasts were quitting the château of\r\nBernard's father, the elder brother and heir, Guy, told Nivard, the\r\nyoungest of the six sons of Aleth, that now he alone remained to inherit\r\nthe estate. \"Ah,\" cried the lad, \"you would leave me the earthly reward\r\nwhile you gain the eternal? The exchange is not fair.\" And in time he,\r\ntoo, sought his brothers in the cloister as did his father, who died in\r\na Cistercian robe.\r\n\r\nAll the nations of Europe were meeting then in the internationalism of\r\nmonastic institutions. St. Stephen Harding, who was practically the\r\nfounder of the Cistercian Order, who drew up its charter and began its\r\ncentralized system of chapters-general, was an Englishman, educated in\r\nSherborne abbey in Dorset, and later at Paris University. Feeling the\r\ndesire to visit Rome in pilgrimage, he went there afoot, reciting each\r\nday, as he walked, the entire Psaltery. It is said that benignant joy\r\nshone in his face. To-day a Bible he translated is treasured in Dijon;\r\nhe used to consult the learned rabbis of his acquaintance whenever in\r\ndoubt concerning the Hebraic text. It was an hour of internationalism. A\r\nfrequenter of St. Bernard's own Clairvaux was St. Malachy O'Morgair,\r\narchbishop of Armagh, who died in Bernard's arms in 1147. The Burgundian\r\nsaint loved Malachy for his gentleness, his holiness, his delicacy of\r\nsoul, and his noble majestic presence, and for him trained young Irish\r\nmonks to serve in the reform needed then in the Celtic church, thus\r\npaying back to Ireland the debt incurred by the mission of Columbanus.\r\n\r\nWith such souls as Bernard and his kinsmen, the new Order governed by\r\nAbbot Stephen Harding took on fresh vigor. Pontigny was founded a year\r\nlater, and in 1115 Bernard and twelve companions were sent to establish\r\nClairvaux[312] in a former robber haunt given by the Count of Champagne,\r\na valley of wormwood which they turned into a valley of light. By the\r\nmiddle of the XIII century there were five hundred Cistercian houses in\r\nEurope. In England, from 1125 to 1200, rose a hundred monasteries of the\r\nwhite monks, Fountains, Furness, Tintern, Kirkstall, \"God's castles,\"\r\nwrote a contemporary, \"where the servants of the true anointed King do\r\nkeep watch, and the young soldiers are exercised in warfare against\r\nspiritual evil.\" Many a Cistercian house was in Scotland and\r\nIreland--Melrose, Mellifont, Boyle; in Germany and the north--Maulbronn,\r\nArnsberg, Warnhem, and Sorö; in Spain--Poblet and Santa-Creus; in\r\nPortugal--Alcobaça. St. Bernard himself founded Chiaravalle near Milan,\r\nand on the spot of the Roman Campagna where St. Paul was beheaded\r\nflourished the Cistercian house of Tre Fontane, whose first abbot,\r\ntrained under Bernard at Clairvaux, mounted Peter's Chair as Eugene III.\r\n\r\nWherever the Cistercians went they promulgated the new Gothic building\r\nlore of France. Their churches with square east end, square chapels\r\nopening on transept arms, and neither tower, triforium nor clearstory,\r\nwere built exactly alike whether it was in the far north as at Alvastra\r\nin Sweden, or in the far south as at Girgenti in Sicily. Burgundy's\r\nabbatial at Fontenay is the type at its purest.\r\n\r\nM. Camille Enlart was first to draw attention to the active rôle played\r\nby Cistercian monks in the dissemination of Gothic architecture in\r\nEurope.[313] All Cistercian churches were dedicated to the Mother of\r\nGod, and the use of the gracious term _Notre Dame_ spread from their\r\nabbatials to the cathedrals. Dante opens the final canto of the\r\n_Paradiso_ by a eulogy of the Queen of Heaven, put into the mouth of St.\r\nBernard, who never flagged in her praise, culling from Scripture every\r\nmystic and lovely name for her. _Io sono il suo fedel Bernardo_, the\r\nBurgundian proudly boasts in Paradise. Though Bernard's devotion to his\r\n_Dame souveraine_ was poles apart from Puritanism, his rules for\r\necclesiastic plainness were as rigid as those of the Puritans. His\r\nsevere ideas concerning art restrained the earlier Cistercian churches,\r\nthough his apostolate quickened the spiritual forces that soon were to\r\nrear the cathedrals.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that to relate St. Bernard's life is to resume the\r\nhistory of the XII century during half its course. He ended the schism\r\nof an anti-pope; he went up and down Europe preaching unity and peace\r\nand reconciling enemies; he journeyed into Languedoc to combat, by word,\r\nthe Catharist heresy; fearlessly he rebuked scandal in high places. He\r\ndrew up the Rule for the Military Order of Templars. His _Book of\r\nConsiderations_, written for Eugene III, became a manual of behavior for\r\nthe papacy. His treatise on Grace and Free Will defined so perfectly the\r\nChurch doctrine of Justification that almost textually it was repeated\r\nby the Council of Trent. No man ever received more overwhelming ovations\r\nthan Bernard; at Toulouse they crowded to kiss his hand till his frail\r\narms were swollen past all movement; at Albi a jeering crowd was\r\nsubjugated by one sermon; in northern Italy, such was the reverence for\r\nthe maker of peace between the rival cities, that Genoa chose him as a\r\npatron, and Milan placed herself under his protection. As he crossed the\r\nAlps, word passed among the mountaineers, and his way became a triumphal\r\nprocession. He was worn to a shadow in the service of Christendom when\r\nEugene III commissioned him to preach the Second Crusade, and when the\r\nexpedition proved a lamentable failure, Heaven sent this strong man, who\r\nhad passed unscathed through the intoxication of human glory, the\r\nseverer test of human disgrace.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the greatest proselytizer since St. Paul is no vague one\r\nin history. Bernard was tall and slender, with chiseled features like\r\npolished ivory; his hair was red-blond; in his blue eyes was a flame of\r\ncelestial purity. Many have testified to the serenity of his visage, the\r\nmodesty of his attitude, and the almost superhuman influence he exerted\r\non those who saw him. They say that the very sight of him preached.\r\nApart from the numerous descriptions of him by his contemporaries,\r\nthere are over four hundred of his own letters extant, letters\r\nstraightforward, abrupt, ironic here and there, fearless, and\r\nwarm-hearted. He swayed emperors and kings, yet retained always his\r\npersonal humility. Reluctantly he tore himself from the peace of\r\nClairvaux to direct the affairs of Europe, and eagerly he returned to\r\nthe life of prayer and brotherly love. A preacher, he said, must be a\r\nman of prayer if he would convert men. He must be a reservoir kept full\r\nand overflowing, not merely a canal that can run dry.\r\n\r\nSome to whom the spiritual life is a dead letter have called the abbot\r\nof Clairvaux unsympathetic and superhuman. Others, while admiring him,\r\nregret his brusqueness and hardy invectives. It was not a day when\r\ncontroversialists handled their adversaries with gloves; witness\r\nAbélard's onslaughts on those who disagreed with him on the most\r\nabstract theological points. No doubt, in some cases, Bernard's zeal\r\nexceeded propriety; perhaps his father had touched exactly on the defect\r\nof his qualities when he advised him to keep measure in all things. But\r\nwho that appreciates this great man would tone down his splendid\r\nvehemence? His love for morality and pure doctrine was a glorious\r\npassion. He struck at the sin, not the sinner. Such censures are the\r\nanger of love.\r\n\r\nAnd remark how the men whom Bernard rebuked accepted the humiliation of\r\nhis public censures. When he asked the archbishop of Sens--the feudal\r\nlord, Henri le Sanglier, who began that cathedral--if he thought justice\r\nhad disappeared from the rest of the world as it had from his own heart,\r\nthe proud churchman set about curbing his autocratic tendencies, and\r\ndied an honored pastor. No disputants ever more soundly berated each\r\nother than Abélard and Bernard, yet their reconciliation, brought about\r\nby kindly, large-minded Peter of Cluny, was frank and complete. And we\r\nhave seen how Abbot Suger changed his worldly ways of life, how he\r\nreformed his monastery, and how the revenues hitherto wasted on a\r\nretinue of sixty horsemen were devoted to building the first Gothic\r\nmonument in France.\r\n\r\nSt. Bernard was, without question, the most eloquent preacher of the\r\nMiddle Ages, but the conversions he wrought were due as much to the\r\npurity, charity, and humility of his own life as to his unparalleled\r\npowers of persuasion. The ideal of that harsh age, despite its\r\nshortcomings, was saintliness, and when men found it incarnate in this\r\nBurgundian, they accepted him as their leader. Bernard held that it was\r\nfalse principles that led to social corruption, and to punish the evil\r\nact while the mental crime which led to it went unchastened, was\r\nillogical. So whenever the purity of Christian doctrine was threatened,\r\nthis champion of the Cross emerged from his seclusion full armed for its\r\ndefense. His vigilance was not bigotry. When a fanatical German monk\r\npreached a persecution of the Jews, the abbot of Clairvaux came to their\r\ndefense: \"The Just,\" an old rabbi called him, \"without whom not one\r\namong our people had saved his life. Honor to him who came to our succor\r\nin our hour of mortal anguish.\"\r\n\r\nIn all Bernard's writings is not one word of disloyalty to what he\r\nthought was right, not a trace of the hypocrite. If he thundered against\r\nambition, cupidity, and that hypocrisy which moves about in dim corners,\r\n_perambulante in tenebris_, he knew that scandals there have been and\r\nwill ever be, since even among the chosen twelve Judas betrayed, Peter\r\ndenied, and Thomas doubted. He might flagellate ecclesiastic disorders\r\nas openly as Luther himself, but the pope called him the pillar of the\r\nChurch and its guide. Towering above his fellow men morally, he took up\r\nhis Master's cord whips to drive the traffickers from the temple, but he\r\nleft an altar in the sanctuary and a high priest at the altar, and his\r\nown life was blameless.\r\n\r\nThe choicest spirits of the age sought Bernard's friendship. He was\r\nloved by St. Norbert, whose new Order of Prémontré spread over Europe\r\nwith the same rapidity as that of Cîteaux. He had links with the mystics\r\nin St. Victor's abbey at Paris; Hugues de St. Victor submitted cases of\r\nconscience to him; Richard de St. Victor asked of him criticism on his\r\nbook on the Trinity; and the Latin hymns of Adam de St. Victor breathe\r\nthe selfsame spirit as that of the Burgundian mystic. Geoffrey de\r\nLèves, who built the tower at Chartres, traveled with him in Italy and\r\nLanguedoc. Pierre de Celle, who built the choir of St. Remi, at Rheims,\r\nwrote of Bernard: \"His life, his fame, his works, his writings, his\r\nmiracles, his faith, his hope, his charity, his chastity, his\r\nabstinence, his words, his visage, his gestures, the attitude of his\r\nbody, all, in a word, rendered homage to his sanctity. He was the\r\nwell-beloved disciple of the Lord, in whose honor he built, not only one\r\nbasilica, but all the basilicas of the Order of Cîteaux. If, then, thou\r\nwouldst touch the pupil of Our Lady's eye, write against Bernard.\" And\r\nthe bishop of Paris, who worked on the façade of Notre Dame, the\r\nschoolman, Guillaume d'Auvergne, testified that Bernard \"lived in the\r\nhighest perfection,\" that his \"wisdom proceeded not from human\r\ninstruction, but from divine inspiration.\" The first great master of\r\nscholasticism, Guillaume de Champeaux, the progenitor of Paris\r\nUniversity, was bound to Bernard in loving friendship till his death,\r\nand asked to be buried in the abbey church at Clairvaux.\r\n\r\nDetachment from the things of the world never weakened this saint's\r\nhuman affections. What cry from a stricken heart is more moving than\r\nBernard's lament for his brother Gerard? That elder brother was\r\nfollowing a knight's career when Bernard won him for God's service in\r\nthe cloister. There for twenty-five years they lived side by side. They\r\nhad just returned together from Italy when Gerard suddenly died.\r\nDry-eyed, Bernard attended the burial, and dry-eyed he went about his\r\ndaily tasks. He mounted the pulpit to continue an exposition of the\r\nCanticle of Canticles which he was conducting, and all at once his grief\r\nbroke forth irresistibly in one of the sublime elegies of literature,\r\nrecorded by a monk of Clairvaux who heard it: \"What is there in common\r\nbetween this Canticle of joy and me who am in bitter anguish!... I have\r\ndone violence to my heart.... Grief shut in but wounds with deeper\r\nsting. It has vanquished me. What I suffer must have its way. I must\r\npour out my trouble before you, my sons, who knew the faithful comrade I\r\nhave lost and the justice of my sorrow. You knew his vigilance, his\r\nsweetness; you knew my need of him. When I was weak in body, he\r\nstrengthened me; when I hesitated he spurred me on; when I grew\r\nnegligent he cautioned me. My Gerard! why have you left me to stumble\r\nalone on the road we two trod together, my brother by blood but still\r\nmore by religion! Ah! I would know if you still think of one whom you\r\nloved, if, in God's presence, you can lean toward our distress? You have\r\nshed your mortal weaknesses, but surely not your human tendernesses, for\r\ncharity endures, says the apostle. No! my Gerard does not forget me in\r\neternity! It was our joy to be together, inextricably were our spirits\r\ninterlinked, the same thoughts, the same emotions, the same will; one\r\nonly heart, one only soul between us; with one blow, the sword has\r\npierced my heart and his.... That I might have tranquillity he took on\r\nhis own shoulders the material cares of the convent. It was his heart\r\nbore my troubles. His eyes led my steps. Now, when a need rises I turn\r\nto where I think to find him, and he is not there!... I am deprived of\r\nthe best part of myself and I must not weep. My heart is torn from my\r\nbosom, and I must not suffer.... But my courage is not of stone.... I\r\nsuffer, I weep, and my grief is ever before me....\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on it runs, this lamentation with its Hebraic note of sorrow's\r\npassion. Impregnated through and through was Bernard with the Bible, and\r\nhis speech fell naturally into its cadences. To mark the biblical\r\nreferences in his works would be, says the student, to fill half the\r\npages with annotations.\r\n\r\nThere is a book of interior consolation, precious to humanity, which has\r\npreserved for us intact the spiritual teachings of this Cistercian abbot\r\nwho led the XII century. Scholars say that the _Imitation of Christ_\r\nbears the direct impress of St. Bernard's spirit, that it reproduced and\r\nanalyzed his writings. Whoever its author, his prayer _Da mihi nesciri_\r\nhas been answered.\r\n\r\nThose who have been comforted by the book which, next to the Bible, has\r\nbeen chief solace for the stricken heart, have leaned unaware on the\r\npurpose, the faith, and the purity of the greatest saint of the Middle\r\nAges, the man who made Burgundy as illustrious by its Cistercian\r\nreformers and missionary builders as it had been by its Benedictines\r\nwhen Cluny was a world power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nGothic Art in Normandy[314]\r\n\r\n     The cathedral was perfected slowly and passionately. The Romans\r\n     brought to it their force, their logic, their serenity. The\r\n     Barbarians brought to it their naïve grace, their love of life,\r\n     their dreamful imaginations. From this unpremeditated collaboration\r\n     sprang a work modelled by times and places. It is the French genius\r\n     and its image. It did not progress by fits and starts; it was not\r\n     the servant of pride. It mounted in the course of centuries to\r\n     complete expression. And that expression, one throughout the\r\n     country, varies with each province, with each fraction of a\r\n     province, just enough to make interesting the chain that joins all\r\n     the pearls of this monumental necklace of France.\r\n\r\n     --RODIN, _Les cathédrales de France_.[315]\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtually the land conquered by the vikings received its civilization\r\nfrom monasteries. Like Burgundy, Normandy was a very Egypt, a Thebaid,\r\nfor the number of its religious houses. Each baron sought to have one on\r\nhis domain. In the capital of the duchy was St. Ouen, whose abbot owned\r\nhalf the city; on the same Seine lay Jumièges, a center of letters and\r\narts, and farther down the river was St. Wandrille, \"nursery for\r\nsaints\"--three noted houses that inherited directly the apostolate of\r\nCeltic Columbanus. From St. Wandrille went monks to establish Fécamp,\r\nfavorite of the Norman dukes, with an early-Gothic church equal to a\r\ncathedral. Other monks from Fontenelle reorganized the most romantic\r\npile of monastic buildings in the world, Mont-Saint-Michel, guarded by\r\nthe patron of the kingdom of France, _Sanctus Michael in periculo\r\nmaris_.\r\n\r\nWhen that man of genius, William of Volpiano, abbot of St. Bénigne, at\r\nDijon, came to Normandy to reform its houses, he himself rebuilt the\r\nabbatial church at Bernay which architecturally is an ancestress for\r\nsuch Romanesque work as Cerisy-la-Forêt, Lessay, the Caen abbatials, and\r\nSt. Georges de Boscherville. At Mortain, at St. Sauveur-le-Vicomte, at\r\nSt. Évroult, were monastery churches, and the picturesque ruins of\r\nHambye cause one to mourn that Primary Gothic abbatial wrecked by the\r\nRevolution. St. Pierre-sur-Dives and the collegiate at Eu are later\r\nmonastic works of the province. For its influence as a world power--what\r\nwe may call the Cluny of Normandy--was Bec abbey that became, under\r\nLanfranc the Lombard, and St. Anselm the Piedmontese, the intellectual\r\nleader of the West. Its mammoth church has gone the way of\r\nCluny's--scarcely stone left on stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEC ABBEY[316]\r\n\r\n    O beata solitudo!\r\n    O sola beatitudo!\r\n    --(Inscription on a Benedictine monastery in France.)\r\n\r\nIn Bec, theology for the first time spoke the language of philosophy.\r\nHerlouin, an unlettered knight, who learned to write only at forty,\r\nfounded, in 1034, an abbey on his lands on the banks of a beck in the\r\nvalley of Brionne. With the monks who gathered round him, he was engaged\r\nin building with his own hands his convent when, one day in 1042,\r\nLanfranc of Pavia arrived in their midst, the learned one needed by\r\nthose simple, good men. Lanfranc had been teaching at Avranches, and was\r\njourneying to Rouen when brigands seized him in a forest near Bec,\r\nstripped and tied him to a tree to perish. Before aid came to him, as he\r\nfaced death during long hours--learning that despite his scholarship he\r\nwas incapable of reciting one single psalm to support his soul--a new\r\ncomprehension of life dawned on him, and he vowed himself to the triumph\r\nof religion.\r\n\r\nThe school which he opened in Bec abbey soon drew students from all\r\nparts of Europe. From northern Italy came young Anselm, destined twice\r\nto succeed his master, in Bec as prior, in Canterbury as archbishop.\r\nLanfranc, practiced in the affairs of the world, a born statesman, was\r\nbetter fitted to be primate of England than was Anselm with his\r\nchildlike, tender nature, and his subtle, speculative brain. Bec gave\r\nstill a third archbishop to the see of Canterbury, Theobald, the patron\r\nof St. Thomas Becket; Martin, whilom abbot of Bec, built Peterborough\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\nFor thirty-three years St. Anselm wrote and taught in Bec abbey, student\r\nfirst, then monk, then prior, and in 1078 abbot. There at night, while\r\nall the house slept, he wrote the books which have won for him the title\r\nof founder of the Christian philosophy of the Middle Ages. A forerunner\r\nof scholasticism, he was among the first to set forth the conformity of\r\nChristian doctrine with human reason. Dante places him in Paradise among\r\nthe great contemplatives. The union of the mystic and the rational in\r\ntheology, in the Norman abbey ruled by Anselm, started impulses which\r\nwere to pass down through the centuries. An immediate result was the\r\nquickening of the mental life of the XII century. Among St. Anselm's\r\npupils at Bec was Anselm de Laon, whose classes, with those of Guillaume\r\nde Champeaux, are regarded as the nucleus of the University of Paris.\r\n\r\nWhat is of interest to us here is that, from the hour of the opening of\r\nmen's minds to scholastic learning, rose the architecture of France,\r\nthat the giant energy which built cathedrals had its source in a faith\r\nthat _believed in order that it might understand_, which is St. Anselm's\r\nown proposition, _Credo ut intelligam_, as well as it is the apogee\r\nflight reached by Plato, what the Greek philosopher called _the wings of\r\nthe soul_. And Plato's peer, XIII-century Aquinas, voiced the Greek's\r\nvision, and repeated Anselm's thought, in a hymn whose subtle stanzas\r\nare sung daily over Christendom: \"_Præstat fides supplementum sensuum\r\ndefectui_\" (\"Faith for all defects supplying where the feeble senses\r\nfail\"). Anselm, with his \"face of an angel,\" naïvely enthusiastic over\r\nhis metaphysical proof of God, writing alone in Bec, in the silence of\r\nthe night, was digging unaware the foundations for Chartres, Rheims,\r\nAmiens, and those other visions of the Beyond to which man gave tangible\r\nshape in the scholastic-trained centuries because, _believing_, he\r\n_understood_.\r\n\r\nSorely against his will St. Anselm left the peace of Bec to take up the\r\nduties of England's primacy in an hour when the eternal\r\nlay-ecclesiastical controversy was embittered. The wanton and despotic\r\nWilliam Rufus was the opponent who overwhelmed him. His sole friends\r\nwere the little people for whom, at that time, any churchman who\r\nmaintained independence against layman tyranny was a champion of civic\r\nliberties. The scholar of Bec was the only prelate of the many crossing\r\nfrom Normandy to England who displayed loving kindness for the\r\ndowntrodden Saxons. Homesick in England, St. Anselm used pathetically to\r\nsign his letters to his intimates, \"Brother Anselm by the heart,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury by coercion.\"\r\n\r\nAt Le Bec-Hellouin to-day little remains of the abbatial whose choir\r\nonce soared on twenty immense piers. Again and again the church was\r\nreconstructed. In 1077 Archbishop Lanfranc crossed the Channel for a\r\ndedication. Early in the XIII century the master-of-works at Rouen,\r\nEnguerrand, proceeded to Bec to superintend a new Gothic edifice. A fire\r\nin 1263 caused another renewal of the choir. In the Rayonnant day the\r\nnave was rebuilt on the same lines as St. Ouen's abbatial. The religious\r\nwars of the XVI century damaged the church, whose demolition was\r\ncontinued as late as 1814. What now remains are a portion of the\r\ntransept, a chapter house of the XII century, and the isolated tower of\r\nSt. Nicholas (1467-80), another memorial of Normandy's rejoicing to be\r\nfree of foreign rule. Eight large statues adorn its upper walls.\r\n\r\nBec had been pillaged by Henry V's troops before Jeanne d'Arc's advent,\r\nand the abbot then appointed by the invaders was one of the sixty\r\nuniversity professors and ecclesiastics who condemned the Maid to death\r\nin Rouen, 1431. Ten abbots of Normandy thus tarnished their great names,\r\nbut it is well to bear in mind that in each case the delinquent\r\nmonastery had recently been sacked because of its patriotic stand\r\nagainst the foreigners, and that it was governed by a tool of the\r\nvictors. Fifty Norman abbeys honored themselves by their absence from\r\nthe torture of a young girl who had all England against her, half of\r\nFrance, as well as the perverted learning of Paris University.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORMANDY'S ROMANESQUE SCHOOL[317]\r\n\r\n     The Christian world made no mistake when, in calm confidence, it\r\n     sought, under the wing of the Benedictine abbeys, that strong\r\n     education of the Western races which made possible all the marvels\r\n     of faith, courage, fervor, and humility with which Europe was\r\n     illuminated from the XI to the XV century, from Gregory VII to\r\n     Jeanne d'Arc.\r\n\r\n     --CHARLES DE MONTALEMBERT, _The Monks of the West_.\r\n\r\nNormandy's hardy personality showed at its best in her Romanesque\r\nmonastic churches. Their design is decisive and vast, their construction\r\nsolid--the Norman excelled in masoncraft--and as art they have never\r\nbeen surpassed for grave impressiveness. In the Norman minsters is a\r\nprimeval energy admirably restrained, a massive grace, a something of\r\nreasoned simplicity lost in the Gothic cathedrals of the region. One who\r\nfell under the spell of Normandy's Romanesque architecture has told how\r\nits repose \"appeals to men and women who have lived long and are tired,\r\nwho want rest, who have done with aspiration and ambitions, whose life\r\nhas been a broken arch.... The quiet strength of these lines, the solid\r\nsupport of the moderate lights, the absence of display, of effort, of\r\nself-consciousness, satisfy them as no other art does. They come back to\r\nit to rest after a long cycle of pilgrimage--the cradle of rest from\r\nwhich their ancestors started.\"[318]\r\n\r\nNo church earlier than the year 1000 has survived in Normandy. The\r\nNorseman, while still an unbaptized buccaneer, laid low every\r\nMerovingian and Carolingian edifice. All was in ruin. \"From Blois to\r\nSenlis,\" says the old record, \"not an acre is plowed, for none dare work\r\nin the fields.\" Then, Rollo, chief of the marauders, baptized in Rouen,\r\nsettled down in the duchy granted him in fief by the harassed king of\r\nFrance. In an incredibly short time the erstwhile pagans became the most\r\nindefatigable of church builders. For Normandy, the date 911 is as\r\nimportant a landmark as is 910 for Burgundy, the year of Cluny's\r\nfoundation.[319]\r\n\r\nThe Norman Romanesque school made general use of the roll molding at\r\nwindow and portal, of griffes at the base of piers, blind arcading,\r\nintercrossing wall arches (that became monotonous in the Anglo-Norman\r\nschool), and very frequently it contrived an interior passage at the\r\nclearstory level, whose effect was heightened by the use of arches of\r\ndifferent designs in its outer and inner walls.\r\n\r\nCertain archæologists contend that the predominant influences in the\r\ndevelopment of Norman Romanesque were Lombard, and that in this it\r\ndiffered from other French schools which in main part derived from local\r\nCarolingian work. As the Norman's creative genius was not on a par with\r\nhis constructive abilities, it seems reasonable to look for foreign\r\ninfluence when finding its school precociously formed by the middle of\r\nthe XI century. The Lombards used, before the Normans, the alternate\r\nsystem of ground supports, cubic capitals, transverse arches, compound\r\npiers, crypts, and raised choirs, and their most striking feature of\r\nexterior decoration was the arched corbel table that made a continuous\r\ncornice. Mr. Arthur Kingsley Porter says that diagonals were used in\r\nLombardy early in the XI century as an expedient to economize wood,\r\ngroin vaults being molded on a temporary wooden substructure, but as the\r\nLombard never counterbutted his intersecting ribs, such vaults proved\r\nunsatisfactory and were given up after 1120. If the Norman had an early\r\nknowledge of diagonals through the Lombard, like the Lombard he failed\r\nto derive from them their constructive consequences. That fact of\r\ncreative genius no one can deny to the Ile-de-France. Even if the\r\ncontroversy as to who first used Gothic ribs should be decided in favor\r\nof the Anglo-Norman school, and behind their use of it, traced to\r\nLombardy's Romanesque builders, none of them saw in it what Abbot Suger\r\ndid--the radical member of a new system of building.\r\n\r\nWilliam of Volpiano, a Lombard, and an architect as well as a reformer,\r\nspent many active years in Normandy, where he died in 1031. At Fécamp he\r\nis said to have trained a group of masons. A decade after his death,\r\nLanfranc, born in northern Italy, became a leader in the duchy, and\r\nunder him was built the present nave of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen.\r\nIt seems very natural to suppose that such men, alert as they were to\r\narchitectural progress, should have exerted influence on the Norman\r\nschool. However, M. Lefèvre-Pontalis thinks it wiser not to exaggerate\r\nthe immediate influence from beyond the Alps. He holds that the\r\nRomanesque school of Normandy proceeded in main part from the same\r\nelement as the other pre-Gothic schools of France, elements derived\r\nsomewhat from Barbarian sources, but chiefly from Rome's occupation of\r\nGaul. In the case of Normandy the Barbarian influences would be largely\r\nScandinavian, and there has been considerable speculation over the\r\nNorseman's wooden structure and the Norman's partiality for the pleated\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\nMr. John Bilson is unsympathetic to Mr. Kingsley Porter's ideas of\r\nLombard influence in Normandy, and he considers the early dates ascribed\r\nto Lombard diagonals most improbable. Why, he asks, if the solution was\r\nreached in Lombardy about 1025, did it take three quarters of a century\r\nfor the Normans, directly in contact with the builders of Italy, to\r\narrive after long experimenting at the same intersecting ribs? He claims\r\nthat the Ile-de-France was indebted to Normandy for diagonals, which\r\nwere not in use in the royal domain before 1130, but that, once that\r\nschool came into possession of intersecting pointed arches and flying\r\nbuttresses, it developed from them a new system of construction,\r\nclothing it with a new expression, which we call Gothic. The controversy\r\nis by no means closed.\r\n\r\nNormandy's Romanesque school spread far afield.[320] It passed into\r\nPicardy and penetrated as far south as Chartres. It crossed the Channel\r\nwith the adventurers who descended on England, and with other free\r\nlances who carved out distant kingdoms for themselves, its\r\ncharacteristics appeared in southern Italy and Sicily.\r\n\r\nThe ornamentation of the Norman school came in part from Oriental or\r\nByzantine sources already in use in the Carolingian era, and in part\r\nfrom Scandinavian. Unlike Burgundy, this province, despite its good\r\nstone, never won distinction in sculpture either in the Romanesque or\r\nthe Gothic day. Never was Norman decoration equal to Norman\r\nconstruction, otherwise this school would be without a peer. Its\r\nornamentation lacks variety and imagination. Geometric designs were\r\nendlessly repeated. Both in England and in Normandy the traveler grows\r\nweary of the zigzag or chevron motive, taken from Merovingian\r\ninterlacings, or Carolingian triangular outlines, and very weary, too,\r\nof its variants, the dog-tooth or star ornament, and the fret or meander\r\nwhich reproduced a classical motive. The Carolingian billet molding was\r\nalso overused. Such monotony of decoration was probably the defect of a\r\ngood quality--caution and thoroughness. The Norman seldom attempted what\r\nhe could not put through, hence his churches were usually completed,\r\neven to having their towers crowned by stone spires. The builders of the\r\nIle-de-France were less cautious, but more sublime.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE ABBEY CHURCH OF JUMIÈGES[321]\r\n\r\n     Aucun pays n'avait fourni au moyen âge plus de missionnaires\r\n     chrétiens qu'Irlande, ni d'hommes empressés de répandre chez les\r\n     nations étrangères les études de leur patrie.--A. THIERRY.\r\n\r\nThe first Romanesque church of Normandy with architectural pretensions,\r\nthe first to present the regional school fully formed, was the abbatial\r\nof Jumièges, begun about 1040. That virile, rugged \"château de Dieu\"\r\nstands on a semi-island of the Seine where the river makes a gracious\r\ntwenty-mile meander, or rather, there stand the \"incredible masses of\r\nmasonry\" which are the ruins of Jumièges, a wall of the big central\r\nlantern, a roofless nave, and two gaunt façade towers, the only Norman\r\ntowers entirely of the XI century. In all France is no more austere,\r\nstark, and grandiose a ruin.\r\n\r\nHow from such a predecessor as Bernay's abbatial the Norman could\r\nimmediately evolve an architectural feat as tremendous as Jumièges seems\r\nexplicable only by some strong exterior impetus. Here is the Lombard\r\nalternance of ground supports over whose origin in Normandy much\r\nprinter's ink has been spilled. As the Lombard groin vault embraced two\r\nbays, a strong pier was needed only for the transverse arch separating\r\nthe large square vault sections; or if a timber roof was used, a\r\nreinforced pier was required only for the bigger tiebeams. Now, at\r\nJumièges, the lower structure proves (say certain archæologists) that\r\nnever was a masonry roof planned for, so it is probable that the open\r\ntimber roof required heavy tiebeams only at every other bay, hence an\r\nalternance of substantial and slight piers to correspond to the\r\nalternance of big beams and little beams. Jumièges also used the Lombard\r\nengaged shaft. Its uniform _hautes colonnes_, without capitals, rise\r\nfrom soil to roof, serving as interior buttresses, and some say as\r\nsupports for the tiebeams, since they rose too high to be intended for a\r\nmasonry roof. They bind together the three stories, and æsthetically\r\ntheir rhythm breaks the monotony of the plain walls. Mr. John Bilson\r\nthinks that the wall shafts of Jumièges can have had no other motive\r\nthan to support a vault over the principal span, and cannot have been\r\nthe supports of mere tiebeams. They may have been planned, suggests\r\nProf. Baldwin Brown, to carry an undergirding arch such as occurs\r\nbeneath some wooden roofs.\r\n\r\nNormandy's invention of the sexpartite vault came about, thinks M.\r\nAnthyme Saint-Paul, through her predilection for multiple lines. With\r\nsuch Gothic vaults--each section of which embraced two bays--she\r\nproceeded to reroof various of her Romanesque abbatials, whose already\r\nexistent alternated piers were thus made logical. Almost it would seem\r\nas if the presence of ground supports, substantial and slight, had\r\ncalled into being the new type of masonry roof. St. Denis used a\r\nsexpartite vault in 1140, and M. Lefèvre-Pontalis suggested, at one\r\ntime, that Normandy derived the idea from the Ile-de-France. In the\r\nroyal domain, however, no steps are to be found leading up to it,\r\nwhereas in Normandy can be seen sexpartite vaults of primitive design,\r\nsuch as those covering the Abbaye-aux-Dames, which consist merely of two\r\ndiagonals with a transverse rib crossing their apex. In the\r\nAbbaye-aux-Hommes, where the timber roof of the nave was replaced by a\r\nGothic vault as early, perhaps, as 1135, the vault web is warped to the\r\nintermediate transverse rib. It has been suggested that the sexpartite\r\nvault originated from the employment of the diaphragm arch.\r\n\r\nJumièges abbey church was dedicated \"with great spiritual joy,\" so an\r\nold chronicle relates, by saintly Archbishop Maurille of Rouen, in the\r\npresence of William the Conqueror and Matilda. Maurille had been trained\r\nat Fécamp under the great William of Volpiano. A Gothic choir, added to\r\nthe abbatial later, was blown up after the Revolution by a contractor\r\nwho acquired the monastery in order to sell its stones as building\r\nmaterial. Under the flank of the now roofless nave nestles a ruined\r\nlittle church of the XIV century, St. Peter its tutelary. Two of its\r\nbays incorporate parts from a Carolingian church built by Rollo's son,\r\nWilliam Longsword (928-943). They are of archæological interest in being\r\nthe oldest examples extant of twin arches beneath a common arch for the\r\ntribune-opening on the middle vessel. The arrangement became popular in\r\nthe Romanesque churches of Normandy and England, and can be seen at\r\nMont-Saint-Michel, Rochester, Ely, Gloucester, Peterborough, and\r\nWinchester.\r\n\r\nJumièges was an ancient foundation of Clovis II and Queen Bathilde.\r\nThey granted forests on the Seine to St. Philibert (d. 684), who had\r\nbeen an intimate at the Merovingian court, of St. Ouen and St.\r\nWandrille. To obtain the Celtic rule of Columbanus at its source,\r\nPhilibert visited Luxeuil and Bobbio, and he dedicated a chapel of his\r\nabbatial at Jumièges to the Irish missionary. His own cult was to crop\r\nout at Tournus and Dijon when the Norse piratical inroads drove the\r\ninmates of wrecked monastic houses into Burgundy.\r\n\r\nJumièges was a scene of pillage and massacre during the last acts of the\r\nCapet-Plantagenet duel, when Henry V, the victor of Agincourt, overran\r\nNormandy. The abbot, then appointed, sat in judgment on St. Jeanne in\r\n1431, and fell down dead three months later. After Charles VII had\r\nentered Rouen as conqueror, in 1449, he retired to Jumièges. During the\r\nfeasts of rejoicing _la dame de beaulté_, Agnes Sorel, died in a manor\r\nclose by, and her memorial stone in Jumièges abbatial recorded her\r\n\"pitiful loving kindness to all men and especially the poor and\r\nchildren.\" Days of decline came for Jumièges under her commendatory\r\nabbots. A XVII-century revival of learning was led by the reformers of\r\nthe Congregation of St. Maur, but the famous establishment went under\r\ncompletely during the Revolution. The sequence is the same for most\r\nFrench abbeys.\r\n\r\nFarther down the Seine, at what once was Fontenelle, stand the less\r\nimposing ruins of St. Wandrille's abbatial, consisting of a transept of\r\nthe XIII century and a Flamboyant Gothic cloister, whose _lave-mains_ is\r\na gem of Renaissance delicacy. The house was founded in 649 by St.\r\nWandrille, of Merovingian blood. Like his friend, Philibert of Jumièges,\r\nhe sought the rule of St. Columbanus at its fountainhead, though the\r\nmore equable rule of St. Benedict was to prevail in French religious\r\nestablishments before the VII century closed. St. Wandrille trained many\r\nof the saints who planted monasteries over northern France, and in later\r\ncenturies the Duke of Normandy chose monks from St. Wandrille's abbey to\r\ninstitute a Benedictine house of prayer on the rock of St.\r\nMichael-in-peril-of-the-sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE ABBATIALS AT CAEN[322]\r\n\r\n    Clochers légers, clochers aigus,\r\n                          Clochers de France,\r\n    Par quel attrait d'élan pieux\r\n    Emportez-vous si vite et si haut dans les cieux\r\n    Nos regards et notre espérance?...\r\n    Longs et pareils à ces lances pointus\r\n    Que les géants piquaient au sol,\r\n    Vous montiez d'un seul jet pour défier le vol\r\n    Des hirondelles éperdues.\r\n    --GEORGES LAFENESTRE, \"Clochers de France.\"[323]\r\n\r\nCaen played a prominent part in the builder's story of Normandy. It has\r\nbeen called the Romanesque Mecca. Its church of St. Nicolas (c.\r\n1180-93), one of the most interesting Romanesque edifices of the duchy,\r\nis dismantled, but the Abbaye-aux-Hommes or St. Étienne, and the\r\nAbbaye-aux-Dames, or Ste. Trinité, are in good repair. All the world\r\nknows how William the Conqueror and his good and gentle Matilda of\r\nFlanders each founded an abbey in Caen, \"that God might be served by\r\nboth sexes and thus pardon their transgression.\" Their marriage\r\ndisobeyed Church regulations concerning consanguinity and a canonical\r\natonement was required. Matilda's tomb rests in the middle of the choir\r\nshe built. Her epitaph was inscribed in letters of gold: \"Consoler of\r\nthe needy, lover of piety, a woman who, having lavished her treasures in\r\ngood works, was poor to herself, but rich to the unfortunate. Thus\r\nshe sought the fellowship of eternal life on the second of November,\r\n1083.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Crypt of the Abbaye-aux-Dames at Caen (1059-1066)_]\r\n\r\nThe Abbaye-aux-Dames, begun about 1059, was dedicated in 1066 by the\r\nsame Archbishop Maurille who blessed the new church at Jumièges. A few\r\nweeks after the ceremony, William descended on England, which his\r\nknights and villeins conquered to the chant of the _Chanson de Roland_,\r\nwritten by some unknown poet who, like themselves, looked to the\r\nArchangel of the Peril for inspiration. Yet a few decades more and\r\nRoland's war song was sung by the first crusaders before Jerusalem.\r\nArchitecture, crusades, language, literature--many were the vital\r\nmovements then coming to birth.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the blessing of Matilda's convent of the Holy Trinity, her\r\nlittle daughter, Cécile, was laid on the altar and dedicated to God's\r\nservice. For almost fifty years her aunt, Matilda, daughter of Richard\r\nII and the fair Judith of Brittany, ruled the Abbaye-aux-Dames, and then\r\nCécile succeeded as second abbess; _Dame de la ville de Caen_, her\r\nbrother Henry I of England called her. Cécile was one of the learned\r\nladies of her day, having studied philosophy and belles-lettres under\r\nthe patriarch of Jerusalem. One recalls that it was a contemporary\r\nabbess--at St. Odile in Alsace--who made the first attempt to compile an\r\nencyclopedia. Several English princesses were nuns of the Trinité, among\r\nthem the daughters of Henry III and Edward I. In a later century\r\nCharlotte Corday was a pupil of the convent.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that Gundulf, a monk of Bec, called to Caen by\r\nLanfranc, was architect of the Abbaye-aux-Dames, where his mother had\r\nretired as a nun. This learned and pious man had entered Bec in the same\r\nyear as St. Anselm, and when he had become the bishop of Rochester he\r\nremained faithful to Anselm, then the primate of England, facing bitter\r\ntroubles with the king. The saint came to attend the good bishop on his\r\ndeathbed. Gundulf rebuilt Rochester Cathedral, whose crypt and western\r\nbays are of his time (1076-1108); Rochester Tower, too, he raised, and\r\nthe chapel of St. John in London Tower. It was said of him that he was\r\nthe most skilled of all men in masoncraft.\r\n\r\nThe apse of the Trinité is considered one of the best things in Caen. It\r\nstands over a crypt whose sixteen piers are in four rows. When the choir\r\nwas renovated, after 1100, some of its sculptures were modeled on\r\ncertain Byzantine ivories that had been brought as gifts to Abbess\r\nCécile by her crusading brother. The abbatial's triforium is a blind\r\narcade behind whose wall was essayed some very primitive flying\r\nbuttresses. The present sexpartite vault was an early trial of that\r\nNorman form of the Gothic masonry roof, and is really a quadripartite\r\nvault divided by a transverse rib, the web being unwarped to that\r\nintermediate member. Though the XII century replaced the original timber\r\nroof of the Trinité by this sexpartite one, exactly when it was done is\r\nnot known. But those interested in claiming priority for Normandy in the\r\nuse of diagonal ribs place it before the sexpartite vaulting of St.\r\nDenis. The XIII century added a handsome Gothic chapel to the transept\r\nof Matilda's convent church.\r\n\r\nAs the expiatory abbatial erected by the Conqueror was on a far larger\r\nscale than the Abbaye-aux-Dames, it took longer to build; perhaps the\r\nsame Gundulf of Bec and Rochester was its architect. Over the aisles are\r\ndeep tribunes, some of whose bays have retained their primitive vaults\r\nof the same type as those at Tournus in Burgundy--half barrels placed\r\nside by side on lintels at right angles to the axis of the church. The\r\noriginal roof of the principal span was replaced by the actual\r\nsexpartite vault (whose web is warped to the six branches) about 1130,\r\nsaid M. Régnier; other archæologists have placed it a generation later.\r\nBy the addition of a sexpartite vaulting the much-discussed Lombard\r\nalternate piers were no longer inconsequent. The height to which the\r\nwall shafts of the nave are carried indicates that the cowled architect\r\nhad not purposed originally to cover his main span with a stone roof.\r\nWhen the Gothic vaulting was added the clearstory was changed in the\r\ninterior of the church, but the exterior was left as first built.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Matilda made Caen their chief residence in Normandy, and\r\nLanfranc was brought from Bec in 1063 to be prior of the duke's new\r\nmonastery. He opened a school in Caen to which his pupil, Pope Alexander\r\nII, sent his relatives as scholars. In the peaceful cloister of St.\r\nÉtienne the able Italian composed a treatise--to counteract Berengar's\r\nheresy on the Eucharist--which is considered a small masterpiece of\r\nChristian controversy. Lanfranc was dialectician, administrator,\r\nbuilder, subtle lawyer, and statesman. His genius reached its highest\r\ndevelopment in the organization of a Norman hierarchy for England. He\r\nrebuilt his own church at Canterbury, and two former monks of St.\r\nÉtienne, Caen, rebuilt the cathedral of Winchester and St. Alban's\r\nabbey. Other memorials of Lanfranc's primacy in England are the crypt\r\nand eastern end of Gloucester Cathedral, the work of a monk of\r\nMont-Saint-Michel, the crypt at Worcester, choir chapels and ambulatory\r\nat Norwich, and the western transept of Ely Cathedral, erected by a monk\r\nfrom St. Ouen, Rouen. It is said that during the century and a half from\r\nthe Conqueror to John Lackland the Norman prelates in England erected\r\nover four hundred churches as expiatory offerings for the grievous wrong\r\nperpetrated in the Norman conquest.\r\n\r\nIn Caen, Lanfranc built the nave of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes, a monument of\r\nmagnificent proportions, compact, tranquil, and sincere. When archbishop\r\nof Canterbury he returned to Caen in 1077 for the dedication of his\r\nabbey church. Another ten years and in St. Étienne's choir took place\r\nthe sinister burial of William the Conqueror. In the town was raging a\r\nfierce conflagration which was to wipe out half the place. As they\r\nlowered into the tomb the proud and wrathful overman whose strength had\r\nbeen so pitiless, whose will so inflexible, a poor townsman stepped\r\nforth to forbid the burial, claiming he had been robbed of that special\r\nparcel of land. In the disorders that ensued the corpulent body of the\r\ndead king was injured, and though incense was burned to purify the\r\ninfected air, the people deserted the church in horror. _Sic pulvis es._\r\n\r\nIn 1210 the Romanesque choir of the Abbaye-aux-Hommes was replaced by\r\nthe present Gothic one. Normandy apparently used annulets about the\r\nclustered shafts at a much later date than the Ile-de-France, and it\r\ncontinued to employ its pre-Gothic zigzag decoration. The chapels round\r\nthe choir were made to open one on the other above low dividing walls;\r\nBayeux and Coutances repeated this, as they did the turrets at the birth\r\nof the apse. The exterior aspect of the edifice was enhanced by a row of\r\nsmall rose windows each of which lighted a bay of the choir's tribune. A\r\ngeneration later the same arrangement was employed in the collegiate\r\nchurch at Mantes.\r\n\r\nThe new Gothic choir of St. Étienne at Caen was joined with skill to\r\nLanfranc's grave Romanesque nave. Maître Guillaume is cited as architect\r\nof the new works, and he probably crowned the two western towers that so\r\ngrandly dominate the city. Few architectural views in France surpass the\r\nstark majesty of the fortresslike church built by the Conqueror, as it\r\nappears from across the town, from the rue des Chanoines, when one\r\nstands near the convent church of Queen Matilda. St. Étienne's towers\r\nwere the prototypes for the other notable ones at Caen.\r\n\r\nDuring the XVI-century religious wars the Abbaye-aux-Hommes was twice\r\npillaged and the Calvinists scattered the Conqueror's ashes. They\r\nstripped the roofing of its lead, which soon caused the collapse of the\r\ncentral lantern and the choir vaults. During two generations the great\r\nchurch lay unused save as a stone quarry. Then the prior, Jean de\r\nBaillehache, in 1609, undertook a restoration, carried through so\r\njudiciously that were it not for the monastery's official record, and a\r\nslight poverty in the sculpture, it would be impossible to detect the\r\nnew parts from the old.\r\n\r\nFor the making of towers Caen is a queen city. In descending the rue des\r\nChanoines one passes the church of St. Pierre, whose much-admired\r\nRenaissance apse (1518-45) was the work of a regional master, Hector\r\nSohier. But it is the tower of St. Pierre which is its glory and the\r\nboast of Normandy. It served as model for belfries throughout the duchy\r\nand in Brittany. Built from 1308 to 1317, it stands as proof that the\r\ntradition of Apogee Gothic continued till the opening of the Hundred\r\nYears' War. Apart from the natural rise and fall of things human various\r\ncauses contributed to the decline of Gothic art after the XIII century.\r\nA soulless mechanical dexterity that crystallized the principles of\r\nGothic architecture succeeded to the creative genius that had made\r\nglorious the reigns of Philippe-Auguste and Louis IX. Symbolism and true\r\nmysticism gave place to doubt, and--when internal dissensions and\r\nforeign invasion rent the land--to superstition. With the blurring of\r\nspiritual vision passed the vigor of construction.\r\n\r\nThe XIV century in France opened under a king who debased the coinage,\r\novertaxed the clergy, persecuted the Jews, and who, by the outrage of\r\nAnagni, struck a fatal blow at the prestige of the papacy. Soon followed\r\nthe Black Death, when a third of Europe's population perished. Radical\r\ndeterioration of the national art set in after France \"went to pieces at\r\nthe Battle of Crécy\" (1346). The royal domain was a field of brigandage:\r\n\"From the Loire to the Seine, and from the Seine to the Somme, the\r\npeasants being killed, all the fields lay uncultivated, and this during\r\nmany years,\" wrote Bishop Bérenger of Le Mans. In Paris Cathedral a\r\nforeigner was crowned king of France.\r\n\r\nWhat horrors reigned in Normandy, many an old record relates. More than\r\na thousand patriot leaders perished when English gold was given for each\r\ndecapitated corpse. \"Houses are without occupants, fields without\r\nworkers,\" wrote a XV-century bishop of Lisieux. Bedford's troops\r\npillaged and massacred. Near Falaise twelve thousand civilians were\r\nbutchered in one day. \"The land of Normandy was grievously oppressed and\r\n_le pauvre peuple détruit_,\" wrote Monstrelet. \"Men and women fled for\r\ntheir lives, by land and by sea, as if in peril of fire. Nobles gave up\r\ntheir fiefs, clerks their benefices, burghers their patrimony, rather\r\nthan take oath to the invader.\"[324] _Normannia nutrix_ lay almost\r\nuninhabited.\r\n\r\nSuch is the French version. Naturally the English outlook was different.\r\n\"The false Frenchman,\" sings Drayton in his Agincourt ballad. Freeman\r\nfalls into a vein of self-congratulation. \"Go from France proper into\r\nNormandy,\" he writes, \"and you at once feel that everything is palpably\r\nbetter; men, women, horses, cows, all are on a grander, better scale.\r\nThe good seed planted by the old Saxon and Danish colonists, and watered\r\nin aftertimes by Henry V and John, Duke of Bedford, is still there. It\r\nis not altogether choked by the tares of Paris.\"\r\n\r\nGothic art deteriorated, but so persistently lingered the simplicity,\r\nthe spiritual poignancy of the XIII century that in the late-Gothic day\r\nit was still possible to produce the mystic loveliness of Riom's Madonna\r\nof the Bird, and the humble prayerfulness of Solesmes' Magdalene.\r\n\r\nIn the unspoiled years of the XIV century was built the tower of St.\r\nPierre, at Caen. Its shaft rises in a virile, unbroken ascent from soil\r\nto spire tip. On the busiest street corner of the city it stands like a\r\nperpetual call to recollection and joy. The Norman will boast with\r\nlegitimate pride that it is the most beautiful tower in France,\r\nexcelling those of Chartres and Senlis, whose shafts, he will tell you,\r\nare either too high or too short, whereas his loved tower of St. Pierre\r\nhas spire and shaft in perfect accord. When Caen added this stately\r\nmonument to its wealth of churches it was as rich a metropolis as\r\nRouen, and it had contributed more than London toward the ransom of\r\nRichard Coeur-de-Lion from Teuton captivity. Just before the defeat of\r\nCrécy, this, the intellectual capital of Normandy, was besieged by\r\nEnglish troops, and all its wealth pillaged, and its streets strewn with\r\ndead. Amid havoc wrought, the towers of the Abbaye-aux-Dames were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Belfry of St. Pierre at Caen (1308-1317). Prototype for\r\nthe Gothic Towers of Normandy and Brittany_]\r\n\r\nAll over the department of Calvados are towers.[325] A Romanesque one\r\ncrowns the church of Vaucelles, a suburb of Caen. At Ifs, and near\r\nBayeux, at St. Loup (c. 1180), are others. The monk's church of Norrey,\r\na dependency of St. Ouen, at Rouen, noted for the lavishness of its\r\nfoliate ornamentation, has a tower of the XIII century, and near it,\r\nalso ten miles from Caen, is Secqueville's Gothic beacon. There are\r\nbelfries at Bernières-sur-mer (c. 1150), at Langrune, Thaon, Tour, and\r\nBasly.\r\n\r\nThree of the most beautiful towers in Calvados crown the abbatial of St.\r\nPierre-sur-Dives, an edifice, too much a patchwork of five centuries to\r\nbe altogether pleasing, but linked with a memorable hour of the Gothic\r\nstory, 1145. Popular enthusiasm then aided Abbot Haimon to reconstruct\r\nhis church, as he wrote, in a much-quoted letter to the English monks at\r\nTutbury. The same wave of fervor was raising the Primary Gothic towers\r\nof Chartres and Rouen. The western towers of St. Pierre-sur-Dives are of\r\nHaimon's day only in their lower stories; that to the south has a\r\nXIII-century top, and that to the north was finished in the XIV\r\ncentury.[326]\r\n\r\nThroughout the final phase of Gothic, Normandy continued to excel in\r\ntowers. Witness Rouen's Flamboyant beacons. In quiet country places and\r\nlesser towns rise belfries as stately as those of cathedrals: at\r\nCarville is the \"Giant of the Valley\" (1512-14), at Harfleur is a most\r\nbeautiful tower, and still another at Verneuil (1506-30), built by a son\r\nof the town, Arthur Fillon, curé of St. Maclou, Rouen, and vicar-general\r\nof that lover of noble structures, Cardinal Georges d'Amboise; when he\r\nbecame bishop of Senlis, he helped to finish the Flamboyant Gothic\r\ntransept of that cathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANESQUE ABBATIAL OF ST. GEORGES DE BOSCHERVILLE[327]\r\n\r\n     I have borne for forty-two years with happiness the sweet yoke of\r\n     the Lord.--ORDERICUS VITALIS (xii century).\r\n\r\nFrom Rouen a pleasant six-mile walk through the forest of Roumare leads\r\nto the abbatial of St. Georges de Boscherville, an example of the best\r\nAnglo-Norman Romanesque. Some have thought it belongs to the first\r\ndecade of the XII century, but M. Besnard places it a generation\r\nearlier. Mr. John Bilson claims that, like its contemporary, the\r\ncathedral at Durham, the piers show that from the start the design was\r\nto construct ribbed groin vaults over the wide span, and he thinks that\r\nthe same is true for the now disused Romanesque abbatial of St.\r\nNicolas, at Caen (1083-93), building twenty years before Durham's choir.\r\nHe has cited the diagonals of Lessay's choir and those of the transept\r\nof Montvilliers as the primitive Gothic of Normandy, vaults which M. de\r\nLasteyrie considered to be contemporary with Suger's St. Denis. The\r\nGerman archæologists, Dehio and von Bezold, give priority to Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe actual intersecting ribs at St. Georges de Boscherville are a\r\nXIII-century reconstruction. So solid were the church walls made that no\r\nflying buttresses have been needed. The tribune at the end of each arm\r\nof the transept is supported by an isolated pillar, apsidal chapels\r\nproject from the eastern wall of the transept, and the central lantern\r\nis one of the best in Normandy. The entire church, save its west façade\r\nflanked by slender turrets, was the work of some six or seven years\r\nonly. About 1157, under Abbot Victor, was erected the chapter house that\r\nnestles beneath the transept's northern arm. The French students who did\r\nnot know, or who have not accepted, Mr. John Bilson's theory of\r\nAnglo-Norman priority in the use of the essential organ of Gothic\r\narchitecture, have claimed that the diagonals of St. Georges' chapter\r\nhouse are among the earliest extant of the province, of the same decade\r\nas the vaulting of the lower hall of St. Romain's tower at Rouen. Mr.\r\nJohn Bilson's championship of Anglo-Norman pioneer work, and Mr. Arthur\r\nKingsley Porter's theory of Lombard priority, have both found supporters\r\namong leading French archæologists; the English scholar is patriotically\r\ndisgruntled at the American's advocacy of the Italian claims.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that during the XI century the Normans, like the Lombards,\r\nused what Mr. Bilson calls ribbed groined vaults, occasionally, for one\r\nreason or another. The Norman developed tentatively the ribbed vault,\r\nalways associating it with the semicircular arch, and without\r\ncomprehending the wonderful results that were to be derived from\r\nconcentrating the weight of a masonry roof at fixed points. The\r\npossibility of those results was perceived first in the Ile-de-France,\r\nand from there, when Gothic architecture had taken on its special\r\ncharacteristics, it entered Normandy by way of the Seine at Rouen and\r\nBoscherville, then at Fécamp and Lisieux. The first Gothic cathedrals of\r\nNormandy show purely French influence and only gradually were regional\r\nogival traits developed. In the controversy as to who first used\r\ndiagonals, one can take whichever side one prefers; the question remains\r\nopen. Light will be thrown on it, doubtless, by a forthcoming paper by\r\nMr. Bilson in the _Archeological Journal_, tracing the evolution of the\r\ndiagonal rib in Normandy.\r\n\r\nThe abbey at Boscherville was founded by the lord of Tankerville, high\r\nchamberlain of the Conqueror and Henry I. In its abbatial, when his\r\ngrandson, hereditary constable of Normandy, was knighted, he laid his\r\nsword on the altar, and to redeem it presented property to the\r\nmonastery. If we would comprehend the society that built these churches,\r\nwe must understand that such donations were voluntary and a matter of\r\ncivic pride. \"If I cannot myself attend to the works of God,\" runs an\r\nancient deed of gift, \"at least I can assure a home for those with whom\r\nGod loves to dwell. It is only natural to enrich our Holy Mother the\r\nChurch, and thus to take a hand in caring for Christ's poor.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHIC ABBATIAL AT FÉCAMP[328]\r\n\r\n     It is a usage bequeathed to us from our ancestors, never to let\r\n     anyone depart from our abbey without a gift.\r\n\r\n     --(From an old Latin chronicle of Fécamp.)\r\n\r\nIf one would enjoy, without critical comparison, the Gothic of Normandy,\r\nher churches should be visited before the taste has become sensitized by\r\nloiterings in the Ile-de-France. In that classic region of the national\r\nart is found a simplicity, a purity, a restraint, a something of\r\nimaginative genius that makes of its work the touchstone by which all\r\nother manifestations of Gothic are judged. Of the Norman churches, the\r\nTrinité, at Fécamp, is most closely related to the Primary Gothic work\r\nof the royal domain. Its architect must certainly have come from the\r\nIle-de-France. Monks trained in the Celtic rule by St. Wandrille founded\r\nFécamp, which was wrecked by Norse pirates in 876. William Longsword,\r\nthe first duke's son, built his palace here, and his son, Richard I the\r\nFearless (d. 996), began a new monastery. In his will Richard ordered:\r\n\"Bury not my body within the church, but deposit it on the outside,\r\nimmediately under the eaves, that the dripping of the rain from the holy\r\nroof may wash my bones as I lie and may cleanse them of the spots of\r\nimpurity contracted during a negligent and neglected life.\" He desired\r\nthat on every Friday a sarcophagus be filled with wheat and grain for\r\nthe poor. His son, Richard II the Good (d. 1020), finished Fécamp\r\nabbatial, and was laid to rest beside his father. The dukes of Rollo's\r\nline especially favored Fécamp, which held a front rank among Normandy's\r\ninstitutions, and was the richest of her monasteries down to the\r\nRevolution. Henry Plantagenet presented Fécamp town to the monastery.\r\n\r\nAfter Duke Richard the Good had brought that man of administrative\r\ngenius, William of Volpiano, into his duchy to reorganize its spiritual\r\nlife, architectural activities took on new vigor. William himself\r\ndirected the construction of Bernay's[329] church; the abbatial of\r\nMont-Saint-Michel rose when he reformed that house; and the church of\r\nJumièges followed immediately after his reformation there. The Blessed\r\nWilliam, in his thirst for souls, used to loiter at the crossroads to\r\ngather in the stricken of body or spirit. He passed away in Fécamp in\r\n1031, and his ashes are still preserved in a chapel of the present\r\nGothic abbatial. In 1034, in the Romanesque Trinité, Robert the\r\nMagnificent gathered the chief men of Normandy to have them swear\r\nallegiance to his sturdy little bastard son of seven, who was to be\r\nknown in history as William the Conqueror, after which Duke Robert\r\nstarted on his pilgrimage to the East, from which he was never to\r\nreturn. The abbey church of Fécamp long consisted of the nave begun by\r\nRichard I, and a choir built by Abbot Guillaume de Ros (1082-1108),\r\nunder whose rule the Trinité won the admiration of Europe. He is said to\r\nhave introduced into Normandy the ambulatory and its radiating chapels.\r\nTwo of the radial chapels which he constructed at Fécamp have survived.\r\nWhile they were building, there lived in the Trinité convent, as prior,\r\nHerbert de Lozinga, who, obtaining the bishopric of Norwich, erected on\r\nthe Norfolk downs a stately Norman cathedral (1096-1119). Abbot\r\nGuillaume de Ros carried out the instructions of Richard I to give a\r\nloaf of bread to every beggar asking it, and when Fécamp was dissolved\r\nat the Revolution its abbot was distributing daily some twelve thousand\r\nfree loaves of bread.\r\n\r\nIn 1169 fire wrecked the Romanesque Trinité, whereupon the present\r\nGothic edifice was begun immediately, and in it two of the groin-vaulted\r\nchapels from the choir of Guillaume de Ros were incorporated. Abbot\r\nHenri de Soullay (1139-87) built the Primary Gothic choir, transept,\r\nand half of the nave. After the fifth bay of the nave a new architect\r\ntook up the work, as is shown by differences in the pier profiles, but\r\nthe cessation of activities must have been of short duration, as the\r\nchurch is homogeneous. The nave was finished under Abbot Raoul d'Argence\r\n(1190-1220), who organized Normandy's first literary academy--a\r\nconfraternity of jongleurs. Its character was more Norman than the\r\nchoir, though regional traits had early appeared in the turrets at the\r\nbirth of the apse and the square central lantern.\r\n\r\nTo increase the impression of length in the nave its side walls were\r\nmarked by double the number of arcades that divide the middle church\r\nfrom the aisles. This was accomplished by introducing a fifth rib into\r\neach vault section of those side corridors, which rib fell on a shaft\r\nengaged in the side walls. Like the minsters of England, Fécamp is more\r\nremarkable in its length than in its height.\r\n\r\nAbbot Thomas de Saint-Benoît (1297-1307) decided to suppress the deep\r\ngallery over the choir's ambulatory, making the chapels that open on the\r\ncurving aisle of exceptional height. He changed the southern aisle,\r\ngiving it a coldly elegant Rayonnant aspect, but happily not that to the\r\nnorth, or we would have lost the two interesting Romanesque chapels of\r\nAbbot Guillaume de Ros. Some of Fécamp's later abbots were Clement VI,\r\nbuilder of the palace of the popes at Avignon and of the Chaise Dieu in\r\nthe mountains of Auvergne, and an abbot of the patriotic Estouteville\r\nfamily, who was driven out by the English when Fécamp was besieged in\r\n1415. The tool who succeeded him sat in judgment on Jeanne d'Arc.\r\n\r\nThe abbot of Fécamp during the transitional Flamboyant Renaissance day\r\nwas Cardinal Antoine Boyer (1492-1519), a Mæcenas who adorned his\r\nbeautiful church with Italian marbles. He had sculptured, in the same\r\nstudio at Genoa that provided Louis XII with the Orléans tombs for St.\r\nDenis, an Entombment more spectacular in character than the famous one\r\nat Solesmes. Girolamo Viscardo made for him a tabernacle (for the\r\nchoir's procession path), after the style of Mino da Fiesole. The\r\nlovely marble screens that close the side chapels are due to this\r\ngenerous prelate. For him Jacques Le Roux, the noted architect of Rouen,\r\nlengthened the Lady chapel. The only later change of importance in the\r\nTrinité was the erection of its neo-classic façade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHIC ABBATIAL AT EU[330]\r\n\r\n     La Nature a bien des manières de sourire. La Normandie est le plus\r\n     beau sourire de la nature temperée.--O. RECLUS.\r\n\r\nThe tutelary of Eu is St. Laurence O'Toole, archbishop of Dublin, son of\r\na prince in Leinster, an active continuer of the reforms begun by St.\r\nMalachy of Armagh, who died in St. Bernard's arms at Clairvaux. St.\r\nLaurence had crossed the Channel to plead with Henry Plantagenet for\r\ncertain of his flock in disgrace (1180). Arriving at Eu's convent, then\r\nbelonging to the congregation of St. Victor, he felt a premonition of\r\nhis approaching death, and exclaimed, as he crossed the threshold, \"Here\r\nis my abode of rest forever.\" He was worn out in the struggle to uphold\r\nthe weak against the strong in those difficult years of the Anglo-Norman\r\nseizure of the eastern coast of Ireland. As his end drew near a monk\r\nsuggested that he make his testament. \"I thank God that I have nothing\r\nto bequeath,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSo impressive was the death of Archbishop Laurence in Eu monastery that\r\nthe little people of the Lord soon began to pray beside his tomb. When\r\nthe monks reconstructed their church they placed the saintly man's\r\nrelics in the new crypt. From 1186 to 1226 the choir, transept, and one\r\nbay of the nave were built without interruption, in a Gothic more of the\r\nIle-de-France than regional, though the placing of towers between\r\ntransept and choir and the central lantern followed the Norman\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Laurence O'Toole was canonized in 1225, and to the joyous\r\nceremony when his relics were set above the high altar came the\r\narchbishop of Rouen--then building his cathedral, and Bishop Geoffrey,\r\nthe \"shining man of Eu by whom the throne of Amiens rose into\r\nimmensity.\" For eight days the throng pressed to pray near the relics of\r\nthe canonized Irish prelate, and with the gifts that poured in the monks\r\nwere able to finish their nave by 1230. It is a gem of Norman Gothic,\r\nsober, elegant, of perfect unity. The first plan called for tribunes\r\nover the aisles, as in the choir. Before they were constructed, however,\r\nthe idea was given up, but it was decided to keep the arches by which\r\nthe tribunes would have opened on the middle church. The same effect of\r\nfalse tribunes had been used earlier in the nave of Rouen Cathedral.\r\n\r\nIn 1426 lightning caused the collapse of the central tower, and in the\r\nreconstruction of the transept and choir, undertaken after the invaders\r\nwere driven from Normandy, Flamboyant work was set side by side with\r\nPrimary Gothic. From 1511 to 1534 rose the transept's florid south\r\nfaçade. After the Revolution the church of St. Laurent was restored by\r\nthe Orléans family, who own the château and park at Eu.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONT-SAINT-MICHEL[331]\r\n\r\n     Chaque peuple a son ange, disait Daniel le prophète. Le nôtre ne\r\n     peut pas, même indignes nous délaisser.... Plus encore que Saint\r\n     Jacques était le patron des espagnols, Saint Michel voulut être le\r\n     Baron de France. Il mit les trois lys dans ses armes et fit passer\r\n     sur le royaume l'éclair de son glaive. Avoir suscité Jeanne d'Arc\r\n     et par elle libéré la France.... Voilà bien le plus beau miracle dû\r\n     à l'archange. Il constitue pour le pays une promesse de\r\n     perennité.--JOSEPH LOTTE (born in Normandy, 1875; killed in the\r\n     World War, 1914).\r\n\r\nSurpassing all the abbeys of Normandy is the outpost of the archangel\r\nthat lies offshore, at the junction of Normandy and Brittany, a conicle\r\nmass of \"rock on rock, keep on keep, century on century,\" sand-locked\r\none hour, and the next rising from the Atlantic. _Tremor immensi oceani_\r\nis the motto of the Mount. Before the days of crusaders it was one of\r\nEurope's chief points of departure for the Eastern pilgrimage. Like\r\nJerusalem, it has been one of the sites of the earth that has impressed\r\nitself with historic signification on the imagination of mankind.\r\n\r\nMany have felt the kindred spirit of the _Chanson de Roland_ and the\r\ngranite, military monastery. They are both of the same high lineage. To\r\nthe paladin Roland, dying at Roncevaux, as he held up his right glove to\r\nGod, his suzerain, there came, to fetch his soul to Paradise, the very\r\nspecial St. Michael of the Mount that stood in peril of the sea, in\r\n_periculo maris_.[332] Scholars think that the most virile, the most\r\nheroic of the _chansons de geste_, wherein already was _la douce France_\r\nloved beyond the regional cradle, was composed by a Norman who lived in\r\nthe marches within the cult of the Angel of the Peril.[333]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Hall of the Knights at Mont-Saint-Michel\r\n(1203-1228). Second Story of the Merveille_]\r\n\r\nAlas, in our day Mont-Saint-Michel-au-péril-de-la-Mer is in very deadly\r\nperil of the land, for it looks as if the covetousness of financiers was\r\nto defraud France of this rock of glory \"_qui s'émeut et s'achève en\r\nprière_.\" Dikes and dams, to reclaim coast lands, will before long cause\r\nthe historic crag to rise from green woods as it did some geological\r\nperiods ago.\r\n\r\nCitadel, palace, cloister, church, and town, the Mount is a thing of\r\nromance that not all the vulgarity of daily tourist crowds can tarnish.\r\nCharlemagne himself chose its tutelary archangel for the national patron\r\nsaint, and the cowled guardians here were in truth through long\r\ncenturies what the great emperor called monks: \"Knights of the Church,\r\nof the willing vassalage and chivalry of Christ.\"\r\n\r\nThe Northmen destroyed the ancient shrine. Then Richard the Fearless,\r\ngrandson of the pirate Rollo, placed on the rock the sons of St.\r\nBenedict, trained at St. Wandrille. Richard II, in 1017, came to the\r\nMount to ask a blessing on his union with Judith of Brittany, whose\r\nbeauty was such that the old chronicle exclaimed _corpore et moribus\r\nusque ad miraculum elegantem_. The duke's marriage gift enabled the\r\nmonks to supplant their Carolingian church by a bigger one. The\r\ndiscarded X-century chapel was discovered in 1909 by M. Paul Gout, the\r\nMount's latest historian. Until 1780 it had been used as Notre\r\nDame-sous-Terre, but during the building of the foundations for the ugly\r\nwest façade of the upper church it was walled up.\r\n\r\nWith Richard the Good's donation, Abbot Hildebert II erected his new\r\nchurch on the very summit of the rock, but as there was not sufficient\r\nlevel space, he built out from the hillcrest a platform of masonry to\r\nsupport the nave. From William of Volpiano's school at Fécamp came\r\nskilled journeymen. The church at Mont-Saint-Michel was begun in 1020,\r\nand still building in 1057. Abbot Roger I, formerly chaplain to William\r\nthe Conqueror, erected the nave. William prayed at the Mount before\r\nundertaking the conquest of England, and the abbot fitted out for him an\r\nentire fleet.\r\n\r\nIn 1103 the northern wall of the Romanesque nave collapsed one night as\r\nthe monks were chanting matins in the choir. It was restored immediately\r\nin the same style, and Abbot Roger II took the opportunity to\r\nreconstruct the monks' quarters. Above the crypt called Aquilon (c.\r\n1112) he built a cloister, which later was vaulted with diagonals, and\r\nover that _promenoir_ was made a dormitory on the same level as the\r\nchurch. During the years that followed the Mount was governed by a man\r\nof genius, Robert de Torigni (1153-80), whose chronicle is the most\r\nimportant history of France for that epoch. In the _promenoir_ he\r\nentertained, at a banquet in 1158, his sovereign, Henry II, and Aliénor\r\nof Aquitaine. They chose him as godfather for their daughter, who,\r\nlater, as queen of Castile, built the convent church of Las Huelgas by\r\nBurgos. Abbot Robert was a pupil of Bec, whose higher standards of\r\nintellectual life he brought to the Mount, where he formed a library,\r\nbuilt monks' quarters, and added western belfries to his abbatial,\r\nthough the façade of his day no longer exists.\r\n\r\nAs the XIII century opened, Normandy became once more a part of the\r\nroyal domain, after being three centuries under dukes of its own. When\r\nRollo's strong breed ended in the debased John Lackland, the northern\r\nprovince gladly accepted Philippe-Auguste as ruler. How whole-heartedly,\r\nhow unreservedly French it became it was to prove by its heroic\r\nresistance to the English invaders during the Hundred Years' War.[334]\r\n\r\nIn the frays of 1203, fire had spread from the town that hugged the\r\nrock's edge, to the monastic buildings on the summit. Philippe-Auguste,\r\nalways wisely conciliatory toward new subjects, contributed toward the\r\nrestorations. With the gift from the king under whom most of the Gothic\r\ncathedrals of France were begun, Abbot Jourdan (1191-1212) built the\r\nsupreme architectural work of the citadel, what is called the Merveille,\r\nand a marvel indeed are its three stories that rise, one above the\r\nother, hall over hall, two hundred feet in height above the sea, ridged\r\nheavily outside by stout buttresses and graced within by pillars,\r\narches, and a sky-gazing cloister.\r\n\r\nFrom the brain of some unknown cowled genius sprang this _mâle_ and\r\nsplendid conception, built in the very prime of Gothic. Who else but one\r\nenamored of meditation would have set his cloister atop of his monastery\r\nunder the open sky, or have opened on that courtyard of peace a monks'\r\nrefectory, where, in a flooded stillness of light, the brethren could\r\nsit pondering as they listened to one of their number reading from the\r\nstone lectern the book which is the spirit of Bernard of Clairvaux\r\nincarnate: \"Give all for all; seek nothing; call for nothing back. Thou\r\nshalt be free in heart and the darkness shall not overwhelm thee.\" And\r\naround them there spread the wide horizon of the sea one hour, of the\r\nwhite ashes of sand the next.\r\n\r\nPacing the lovely skyward cloister one has time to brood on life and\r\ndeath, on God and one's own soul; it refutes a hundred calumnies\r\nagainst monastic life just by being what it is. Serious men enamored of\r\nvoluntary seclusion carved it unstintingly and set its columns quaintly\r\nin triangular order. Love and science contrived the diffused, soothing\r\nluminousness of the brothers' dining hall. The present gable windows\r\nthere are innovations. Originally when one entered one could discern no\r\nwindow, and yet light was everywhere. The side walls, that from the door\r\nappear to be blind arcades, are in reality a succession of narrow panel\r\nwindows--thirty to a side--deeply recessed in stone embrasures that are\r\ntriangular in shape, because they serve the purpose of buttresses. To\r\nhave carried the exterior buttress ridges to such a height as is this\r\nrefectory, set audaciously up in the sky on the Merveille's third story,\r\nwould have been an awkward procedure; so the nameless monk-architect,\r\nbecause he was a XIII-century man, let his genius lead him, and, \"master\r\nof the living stone\" that he was, contrived a supreme beauty of\r\ndecoration out of a structural necessity.\r\n\r\nThe Merveille was erected under a succession of abbots, in one\r\nconsecutive radiant effort, from 1203 to 1228--a Titan's work. Each of\r\nits three stories is divided into two halls; on the ground floor are the\r\nalmonry, where the pilgrims fed, and a groin-vaulted cellery or\r\nstorehouse; the top story, as we have seen, consists of open cloister\r\nand monks' refectory; and between the upper and lower stories are two of\r\nthe most vigorous halls ever built; that over the almonry called the\r\nSalle des Hôtes because in it were entertained the guests of the\r\nmonastery, and that to the west, over the cellery, acquiring the name\r\nSalle des Chevaliers, from the Order of the Knights of St. Michael,\r\nwhose members met here. The latter is divided by rows of stout pillars,\r\nand served as the common room of the community, where the tireless\r\nscholar-scribes illuminated missals and copied manuscripts.\r\n\r\nThe charter for the military Order of the Archangel, founded in 1469 by\r\nLouis XI, welded the name of St. Michael, whom every good Frenchman knew\r\nkept a specially friendly eye on France, with that of Jeanne the Maid,\r\nwho had quitted Domrémy-on-the-Meuse because the voice of her dear\r\narchangel rang insistent in her ear: _Fille Dè, va! Je serai à ton ayde.\r\nVa!_ It was St. Michael who first roused her to the sense of the great\r\nmisery there was in the kingdom of France, and in her hour of victory\r\nafter Orléans she spoke of going to the rescue of the besieged Mount in\r\nNormandy. At her trial in Rouen she dwelt on the comfort he had given\r\nher.[335] He appeared to her, she said, in the guise of \"_un très vrai\r\nprud'homme_\"--the term loved of St. Louis, who once told Joinville that\r\nto be _prud'homme_ meant to be knight in heart, as well as outward\r\nbearing. \"I believe the words of St. Michael who appeared to me,\" said\r\nJeanne, at her trial, \"as firmly as I believe that Our Lord Jesus Christ\r\nsuffered death and passion for us. And what leads me so to believe is\r\nthe good counsel, comfort, and good doctrine St. Michael gave me.\"\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the Merveille, the monks continued building. They\r\nhad finished the officiality hall by the entrance gate of the monastery\r\nbefore the visit of St. Louis to the Mount in 1254, when he came to\r\nreturn thanks for his safety during his late crusade. The XIV century\r\nadded more defenses till the rock became the most forceful example of\r\nmediæval military architecture. Strong walls were needed during its\r\nsiege by the English who invaded Normandy under Henry V. The Mount's\r\nabbot, Robert Jollivet, whose name figures among the well-paid judges at\r\nRouen in 1431, allied himself with the victorious foreigners who had\r\nquickly overrun the province. His monks repudiated him, led by their\r\nprior, Jean Gonault. Defended by the gallant knight Louis\r\nd'Estouteville, they endured the longest siege recorded in history,\r\n1415 to 1450, when, as Jeanne had proclaimed, the invaders were \"_boutés\r\ntous hors de France_.\"[336]\r\n\r\nIn 1429, during the memorable siege, the Romanesque choir of\r\nMont-Saint-Michel's abbey church collapsed. It was impossible then to\r\nrebuild it; they had even to sell their altar vessels to carry on the\r\ndefense. When Normandy was again a part of France the erection of a new\r\nchoir was undertaken by the abbot of the Mount, who was none other than\r\nthe distinguished Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville, the chief agent in\r\nthe vindication of Jeanne d'Arc's memory. His layman brother had\r\ndirected the defense of the Mount during many years. In 1450 were laid\r\ndown the crypt's nineteen mammoth piers, among the most powerful ever\r\nplanted. The upper church reached its triforium story by 1469, the year\r\nwhen Louis XI came to the rock to establish his new Order of knighthood,\r\nand about 1513 the choir was completed. Many hold it to be superior to\r\nall other late-Gothic works in France. There are no capitals, the\r\nmoldings die away in the shafts, the triforium is glazed. It belongs to\r\nthe fleeting splendor of Flamboyant art, but without capriciousness.\r\nThere is no overexuberance, no virtuosity in this vigorous, glad\r\nmemorial of the nation's reconquered freedom:\r\n\r\n    Sainte Jeanne went harvesting in France,\r\n    And oh! what found she there?\r\n    The brave seed of her scattering\r\n                  In fruitage everywhere.\r\n    And where her strong and tender heart\r\n                  Was broken in the flame,\r\n    She found the very heart of France\r\n    Had flowered to her name.[337]\r\n\r\nBuilding activities at the embattled abbey ceased after the erection of\r\nits beautiful florid choir. The evil consequences of commendatory\r\nabbots--those named by royal whim--bore bitter fruit from end to end of\r\nFrance in the relaxed spiritual life of the monasteries. The\r\nXVII-century reformers of the Congregation of St. Maur found the Mount's\r\nabbot to be a princeling of Lorraine, five years of age. Those scholarly\r\nBenedictines carried on excellent research work in local history, but to\r\ntheir neo-classic generation Gothic art was a sealed book.\r\n\r\nDeplorable changes went on during three hundred years: an apsidal chapel\r\nof the church was made into a staircase, irregular windows were opened\r\nin the halls of the Merveille, the cloister was planted as a garden, to\r\nthe deterioration of the lower structures, and when, in 1776, fire\r\nweakened the abbatial, its three westernmost bays were demolished and\r\nthe present ugly façade put up. After the Revolution pillaged the\r\nmonastery it became a state prison called Mont Libre, and so continued\r\nuntil 1863. The church was floored midway to serve as a convicts' hat\r\nfactory. The modern restoration of Mont-Saint-Michel has been, like that\r\nwhich saved the palace of the popes at Avignon, a truly national\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF ROUEN[338]\r\n\r\n     One can say that nothing great ever was accomplished in the Church\r\n     without women bearing a part. A host of them stood among the\r\n     martyrs in the amphitheater; they disputed with the anchorites the\r\n     possession of the desert. Constantine set up the Labarum on the\r\n     Capitol, and St. Helena raised the True Cross on the walls of\r\n     Jerusalem. Clovis, at Tolbiac, invoked the God of Clotilda.\r\n     Monica's tears won the conversion of Augustine. Jerome dedicated\r\n     the Vulgate to the piety of two Roman ladies, Paula and Eustochium.\r\n     The first lawmakers of monkish life, Basil and Benedict, were\r\n     seconded by their sisters, Macrina and Scholastica. The Countess\r\n     Matilda held up the tottering throne of Gregory VII. The wise\r\n     judgment of Queen Blanche dominated the reign of St. Louis. France\r\n     was saved by Jeanne d'Arc. Isabella of Castile led in the discovery\r\n     of the New World. And in times closer to our own we see St. Teresa\r\n     mixing with bishops, doctors, and the founders of Orders by which\r\n     the reform in Catholic ranks was operated. We see St. Francis de\r\n     Sales cultivating like a rare flower the soul of Madame de Chantal,\r\n     and St. Vincent de Paul passing over to Louise Marillac the most\r\n     admirable of his designs, the establishment of the Sisters of\r\n     Charity.--FRÉDÉRIC OZANAM.\r\n\r\nSo much for the abbey churches of Normandy. Many another might be\r\ndescribed, but with six Gothic cathedrals to consider, one must refrain.\r\nOf the six--Rouen, Lisieux, Évreux, Séez, Bayeux, and Coutances--that of\r\nRouen shows the earliest Gothic work and its character is more French\r\nthan Norman, as if the river, flowing down from Paris, carried with its\r\nwaters the characteristics of the art life astir on the banks of the\r\nSeine, Oise, Aisne, and Marne.\r\n\r\nThe least local of Normandy's cathedrals, Our Lady's church at Rouen,\r\nhas a magnetism distinctly its own--from its florid romantic west front,\r\nthe most lavish screen ever set up, to the imposing sentry columns that\r\nguard its sanctuary. The northwest tower is Normandy's best Primary\r\nGothic, the southwest tower the supremest belfry that sprang up to\r\ncommemorate the freeing of France from foreign yoke. The façades of the\r\ntransept and the Lady chapel (whose tombs mark dates in the art history\r\nof France) rank with perfect Rayonnant work. Its storied windows are\r\namong the richest ever dight by mediæval guildsmen.\r\n\r\nNot but that a dozen flaws might be picked in the metropolitan church at\r\nRouen. Were it to be strictly ranked among French cathedrals, it could\r\nnot be placed among the foremost. But it has gone on embellishing itself\r\ncentury after century with a self-respect so sincere that few care to\r\ndispute its claim to stand in the front rank.\r\n\r\nOn a first visit to Rouen many an amateur prefers the regularity of St.\r\nOuen's abbatial, which in size equals Westminster Abbey.[339] St. Ouen,\r\nthe classic of Rayonnant design, geometric in tracery, accentuating the\r\nascending line, coldly perfect in construction, possessed still the true\r\n_sursum corda_ of Gothic, though the art was fast crystallizing into\r\nformulas. The capitals were lessened, and the glazed triforium united to\r\nthe clearstory in a single composition. Made of fine-textured gray stone\r\nSt. Ouen is a stately vessel, but, add the critics, \"its uniform\r\nexcellence is average.\" Gothic lore has not degenerated, but has simply\r\ngone too far in the development of its principles, says the mechanical\r\nartistry of the last built of the great monastic churches of France,\r\nplanned before the tragedies of the Hundred Years' War had petrified the\r\nnational genius.[340]\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Normandy's capital is not uniform, but its excellence\r\nsurpasses the average. It is not homogeneous, its proportions are not\r\nabsolutely harmonious, but it has profundity, personal character, and\r\nflashes of genius. The better it is known the deeper grows affection for\r\nit, which is not the case with St. Ouen. In the latter one feels that\r\nthe cult is the main concern; in the cathedral there is piety of heart.\r\n\r\nThe early history of Sainte-Marie at Rouen follows the usual course.\r\nNorse marauders wrecked the ancient cathedral. Rollo, the first duke,\r\nendowed another which was radically reconstructed under an XI-century\r\narchbishop, a son of Duke Richard II. In 1063, that Romanesque church\r\nwas dedicated by Archbishop Maurille (whose tomb is in the present\r\nambulatory) in the presence of William the Conqueror and his good\r\nMatilda. Vestiges of the Romanesque edifice are in the first bay of the\r\nchoir aisle. In it were interred the prodigious Rollo, the Norwegian\r\nsea-robber, who sacked half Normandy, sailed up the Seine to terrorize\r\nParis, and up the Loire to overrun Auvergne and Burgundy, and yet, no\r\nsooner was he granted the duchy of northern France than the buccaneer\r\ngave way to a ruler whose laws were so respected that golden bracelets\r\nwere left exposed and remained unstolen for years in the forest of\r\nRoumare. Rollo was baptized a Christian in Rouen, in 912, and there he\r\nwedded a Carolingian princess. When his son, William Longsword, died in\r\n945, he was wearing a gold key that opened a casket containing a monk's\r\nrobe for his burial; the new rulers were swift to comprehend that\r\nmonasteries were the chief civilizers in that formative age.\r\n\r\nNear Rouen, in 1087, died the Conqueror, sixth in descent from Rollo.\r\n\"Pirate jostled statesman\" in him, too. Mortally wounded at Mantes, he\r\nwas brought to the priory of St. Gervase--beneath which suburban church\r\nstill exists intact a V-century crypt--and as he heard the bells of\r\nRouen Cathedral ringing, there rose to haunt him the curses, not loud\r\nbut deep, of the oppressed Anglo-Saxons, and most piteously he\r\npetitioned the Queen of Heaven to draw Her Son's attention to all the\r\nreligious houses he had built for the people's good on both sides of the\r\nChannel. No sooner was he dead than his retainers stripped and robbed\r\nhim, and through private charity he was carried to his horror-inspiring\r\nburial at Caen.\r\n\r\nTo Rouen, because of its generosity to him in his captivity, Richard\r\nCoeur-de-Lion bequeathed his heart. In 1203 the last duke of Normandy,\r\nJohn Lackland, fled from Rouen after the murder of his nephew, Arthur of\r\nBrittany, of which the popular voice accused him. Philippe-Auguste\r\nentered the city in triumph in 1204, and the building of the new Gothic\r\ncathedral started apace.\r\n\r\nNotre Dame at Rouen is associated closely with the return of Normandy\r\nunder French rule. On Easter night, 1200, fire ravaged the city and its\r\nchief church. Whether the cathedral then wrecked was that blessed in\r\n1063 by Bishop Robert de Maurille is uncertain. Some think that it was a\r\nRomanesque choir and transept which were burned, and a recently built\r\nPrimary Gothic nave. It may have been an entirely new Gothic church\r\nwhich was destroyed. At any rate, the northwest tower, named after the\r\nVII-century bishop, Romanus, and the side doors of the main façade\r\nescaped the fire. The preservation of the tower was due, probably, to\r\nits position beyond the side aisle. The doors, built about 1180, are\r\nornamented with Oriental incrustations such as are to be seen in the\r\ncathedral at Genoa, with which seaport Rouen had trade links.\r\n\r\nThe Tour Saint-Romain, whose prototypes were the towers at Étampes,\r\nVendôme, and Chartres, was long counted as the oldest Primary Gothic\r\nwork extant in Normandy, with the chapter house at St. Georges de\r\nBoscherville and the chapel of St. Julien, Petit-Quevilly.[341] But as\r\nmany archæologists now say that the Gothic vault of St. Étienne's nave\r\nat Caen may be 1130 just as well as 1160, and that there are still\r\nearlier diagonals in the duchy, it remains an open question where the\r\noldest extant ogival work of Normandy is. Mr. John Bilson claims that\r\nthe diagonals of Lessay's choir pre-date any in the Ile-de-France.\r\nHowever the controversy over the priority of diagonals may be decided,\r\nthe tower of St. Romain is the first Norman monument that shows the\r\nincontestable influence of Gothic of the Ile-de-France type.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of religious ardor that expressed itself in the northwest\r\ntower of Rouen Cathedral was described by Bishop Hugues d'Amiens in a\r\nletter, in 1145, to a brother prelate. He tells how volunteers were\r\nquitting Normandy to aid in the making of the new tower at Chartres: \"In\r\nlike manner, a large number of the faithful of this, our diocese, and of\r\nneighboring regions, put themselves to work on the cathedral church,\r\ntheir mother, forming associations to which no one is admitted unless he\r\nhas confessed his sins, fulfilled his penances, laid down at the foot of\r\nthe altar every enmity and revenge, and become reconciled with his\r\nenemies in a true peace. Under the lead of one in the band, who is\r\nchosen as chief, the people drag heavy wagons in humility and silence.\"\r\nThe writer of this famous letter had been a monk of Cluny, and while\r\nruling the see of Rouen he taught school there; he had inherited the\r\ntraditions of Bec's scholarship through Anselm of Laon. The lower hall\r\nof the cathedral tower then begun is considered faultless. Before the\r\nclose of the century the upper hall was completed, but the belfry story\r\nwas not added till the late-Gothic day.\r\n\r\nAfter the fire of 1200 work on the new cathedral was pushed on with\r\nenergy. A master called Jean d'Andely is cited as the architect, a\r\nnative, probably, of Les Andelys farther up the Seine, where there are\r\ntwo churches so closely resembling the cathedral of Rouen that they are\r\ndoubtless from the same hand.[342] Another architect, named Enguerrand,\r\nis mentioned as quitting work on the cathedral of the capital in 1214,\r\nto undertake the abbatial at Bec. A keystone of Notre Dame, of the date\r\n1233, is inscribed by one Durand, mason. He is thought to have been the\r\nson-in-law of the original architect, Jean d'Andely.\r\n\r\nThe first plan of Rouen Cathedral called for tribunes over the aisles,\r\nbut the idea was given up in order to have the side aisles twice as high\r\nas originally designed. The arches by which the tribunes would have\r\nopened on the central vessel were retained, however, as was done later\r\nwith the false tribunes of the abbey church at Eu. In the side aisles,\r\nresting on the capitals of the nave's piers, are ringed colonnettes that\r\nrise to the ledge above--a ledge constructed to catch the tribune's\r\ndiagonals (which never were built). By this graceful expedient they\r\ncloaked architectural members prepared but not used. The passageway\r\ncarried from pier to pier above the main arcade of the nave is\r\nexceptional. An apsidal chapel projects from each arm of the transept,\r\nas in the Romanesque edifices of the region.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop under whom Notre Dame of Rouen was begun was Walter of\r\nCoutance, _Gautier-le-magnifique_ (1184-1207), who willed his fortune to\r\nthe cathedral, since it was he, devoted public servant of the\r\nPlantagenets, and long the chief justice of England, who had urged the\r\nchapter to sell its treasure to help ransom Coeur-de-Lion from\r\ncaptivity after the Third Crusade. He himself went as hostage into\r\nGermany in order that Richard might be released before his full ransom\r\nwas raised. Learned, liberal, and affable, Bishop Walter was a man of\r\nwhom all spoke well.\r\n\r\nThe choir of Rouen Cathedral showed more the regional characteristics;\r\nthe arches were more acute and the moldings multiple. The circular piers\r\nabout the sanctuary have Norman round capitals. We know that in 1235 a\r\nbishop was buried in the choir, which must have been entirely finished\r\nwhen, in 1255, St. Louis spent Easter in Rouen as the guest of his\r\nfriend and counselor, Archbishop Eudes Rigaud (1247-74), a Franciscan,\r\nwho was to accompany the king on his fatal crusade. The choir's upper\r\nwindows were reconstructed during the XV century.\r\n\r\nAbout 1280, architect Jean Davy began the south façade of the transept,\r\nthe Portail de la Calende, so called because there was carved there a\r\nmythical animal of that name, considered in ancient times as a symbol of\r\nthe Saviour, since the superstition was that the sight of a Calende\r\ncured illness. The transept façades of Rouen are among the best works of\r\nthe Rayonnant phase. Their sculpture, says M. Enlart, has not yet the\r\nfluid indecision of XIV-century draperies. A pronounced feature of that\r\nperiod are the openwork gables, which, though they may be superbly\r\ndecorative, are none the less a step away from constructive sincerity,\r\nsince drip stones made of lacework masonry fail to fulfill their\r\npractical function.\r\n\r\nThe northern door of the transept was named from the canon's library\r\nbeside it. It, too, like the earlier Calende portal, was paneled with\r\nmedallions over which many a pharisee has shaken his head. The Middle\r\nAges were neither pharisaic nor prudish. Rouen's little sculptured\r\ngroups are merely fantastic and popular. They embody no satire against\r\nthe clergy, as some would intimate; nor are they obscene. To place a\r\ncentaur or an acrobat in proximity to a scriptural group seemed then no\r\nmore profane than to illuminate the margins of missals with meaningless\r\nfrolics. Leeway was allowed the artistic imagination, which here ran\r\nlargely to grotesques. The medallions of the Calende door were in better\r\nsequence and of more vigorous character than those of the Portail des\r\nLibraires. Beside this latter entrance is the courtroom of the\r\narchepiscopal palace adorned with statues representing Solomon's\r\njudgment, in souvenir of the old usage of rendering justice before\r\nchurch doors.\r\n\r\nFrom 1302 to 1320 rose the Rayonnant Gothic Lady chapel of impeccable\r\nmechanical skill but not inspired. Long centuries later, during the\r\nRevolution, its tomb of the cardinals d'Amboise,[343] in which Gothic\r\nsculpture culminated, escaped destruction because the axis chapel served\r\nas a granary. Clement V, the builder of Bordeaux' Rayonnant choir,\r\narranged that his nephew, who was archbishop of Rouen and had got into\r\ndifficulties with the Norman nobles, should exchange his see with Gilles\r\nAycelin, the prelate who was erecting Narbonne Cathedral, brother of the\r\nbishop-builder of Clermont's nave. A little later another archbishop of\r\nRouen became the Avignon pontiff who built the audience hall and the\r\nchief chapel of the palace on the Rhone. Other XIV-century additions to\r\nRouen Cathedral are the side chapels; every guild and corporation craved\r\nthus to honor its own particular patron.\r\n\r\nThose contemporary works, Rouen's Lady chapel, the choirs of Bordeaux\r\nand Narbonne, Avignon's halls, belong to the phase of the national\r\ngenius which we call Rayonnant because of its geometric window tracery,\r\na phase aptly designated as metallic by M. Gonse. Artists were fast\r\nlosing their exquisite feeling for the silhouette; the vertical line\r\nwas over-accentuated; triforium and clearstory had become one\r\ncomposition. Pitiless logic was drying up the spring of inspiration.\r\nWhen the cathedral of Rouen remade three bays of the nave's triforium,\r\nthe model taken was the geometric design of that masterpiece of\r\nRayonnant Gothic, the abbatial of St. Ouen. Before the XIV century\r\nclosed the façade of the cathedral was redressed with arcatures and\r\nstatues like the west frontispieces of Wells, Salisbury, and Litchfield.\r\n\r\nThe XV century carried through the chief supplementary works of\r\nSainte-Marie of Rouen in a style frankly florid. Normandy, Artois, and\r\nPicardy reveled in the last development of the national art, regions all\r\nof them having close links with England. For if much of Flamboyant\r\nGothic was indigenous, as M. Anthyme Saint-Paul contends, if it\r\nenveloped and absorbed Rayonnant Gothic, it seems fairly well proved\r\nthat its two most pronounced traits, the flamelike window tracery and\r\narches of double curvature, came from England. M. Enlart says that\r\nramified vaults were built at Ely, Lincoln, and Litchfield, during the\r\nXIII century. By 1304 accolade arches were used; at Merton College,\r\nOxford, is a flame-tracery window of 1310, features not to be found in\r\nFrance before 1375.[344] In the Rayonnant phase lines break; in the\r\nFlamboyant they undulate. Rayonnant capitals were diminished; capitals\r\ndisappeared altogether in the later period, and molds melted into the\r\npiers.\r\n\r\nNormandy expressed her renewed national dignity with enthusiasm in the\r\nflowery, happy architecture we call Flamboyant:\r\n\r\n    Le Temps a laissié son manteau\r\n    De vent, de froidure et de pluye,\r\n    Et s'est vestu de broderye\r\n    De soleil raiant, cler, et beau.\r\n\r\nSo sang Charles, Duke of Orléans, come back from twenty years in English\r\nprisons to witness the expulsion of the invader from Normandy:\r\n\r\n    Il n'y a beste ne oiseau\r\n    Que en son jargon ne chante ou crye;\r\n    Le Temps a laissié son manteau\r\n    De vent, de froidure et de pluye.[345]\r\n\r\nHow they built in Rouen! With what vim and emancipated energy! St. Ouen\r\ncarried forward its nave and raised a central tower. From 1437 to 1480\r\nwas built the gallant little church of St. Maclou with a central tower\r\nthat is one of the best in Normandy, and whose curving front of five\r\narcades is profusely elegant. Similarly large, ornate portals became the\r\nvogue in late-Gothic Norman construction. St. Maclou is to the Gothic\r\nart of the XIII century what the reel is to the minuet, said an English\r\narchitect.[346]\r\n\r\nIn the cathedral of Rouen one noted master succeeded another. Guillaume\r\nPontifs put the belfry on St. Romain's tower (1463-77); built the\r\ncanon's library, to which he made a staircase from the cathedral's\r\ntransept; and made the decorated portico leading from the rue St. Romain\r\nto the court before the Portail des Libraires. No approach to a church\r\npossesses more entirely the atmosphere of the Middle Ages than that.\r\nPontifs began a masterpiece of Flamboyant architecture, the Tour de\r\nBeurre (1485-1509), that, as it rises, grows more and more sumptuous,\r\nthough it never loses its architectural lines. Unfortunately the stone\r\nused was of poor quality, which necessitated a coarse sculpture. The\r\ntransition from square to octagon was gracefully achieved by the one\r\nconstructive arrangement which originated during the final stage of the\r\nnational art: to unify the design, flying buttresses were sprung from\r\nthe corner turrets and the face-shafts to the octagon.[347]\r\n\r\nFrom 1497 to 1507 the master-of-works at Rouen Cathedral was Jacques Le\r\nRoux, who continued the Tour de Beurre, finished by his nephew, Rouland\r\nLe Roux (1507-20), an artist of the first order. He redressed the upper\r\npart of the main frontispiece in order to put it into character with the\r\nTour de Beurre and St. Romain's belfry. After completing the middle\r\nportal of the façade he reconstructed the central tower, whose platform\r\nhe raised a story higher. When Rouen's lantern tower was burned in 1822\r\nthe present iron skeleton was contrived, a structure too mechanical to\r\nbe architecture, but of good effect in the distant views of the city.\r\n\r\nThe oft repeated renewals of the famous frontispiece of Rouen Cathedral\r\naccount for its failure to express the interior church structurally, but\r\nthough merely a screen, it is deservedly popular, \"one of the dreams of\r\nthe Middle Ages,\" M. Émile Lambin has called it. By moonlight its effect\r\nis romantic, almost spectacular. Most popular, too, is another work of\r\nRouland Le Roux, the Palais de Justice which he built with Roger Ango,\r\nfrom 1493 to 1507, for the parliament of Normandy. A pomp and a\r\npageantry carried almost to folly distinguished the generations that\r\nraised monuments such as these. In 1520, when Francis I met Henry VIII,\r\nnot far from Rouen, at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, many a lord,\r\nsays the chronicler, carried on his back his mills and his forests and\r\nhis meadows. One of the most curious houses in France, Rouen's Hôtel du\r\nBourgtherould, now a bank near the Old Market, is decorated exteriorly\r\nby reliefs of the Field of the Cloth of Gold.[348] M. Léon Palustre\r\ndiscovered that the sculpture on its tower, originally polychrome, was a\r\ncopy of a Flemish tapestry in the possession of that prince of\r\npageantry, Philippe le Hardi of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop of Rouen from 1493 to 1510 was none other than the\r\nMæcenas of his age, Cardinal George I d'Amboise, chief minister of Louis\r\nXII. All over France we have traced the work of that art-loving\r\nfamily--at Paris, Cluny, Clermont, Chaumont, Albi. A nephew of the same\r\nname held the see here until 1545, and saw to the erection of his\r\nuncle's tomb, designed by Rouland Le Roux, with sculpture by artists of\r\nthe Michel Colombe tradition as well as those of the Italian\r\nRenaissance.\r\n\r\nRouen was so active a center for glassmaking that, in 1317, Exeter\r\nobtained windows here, as did Gloucester and Merton College, Oxford.\r\nNext to Troyes, Rouen contained the richest collection of colored glass\r\nin France. Until the Revolution her eighty lesser churches were filled\r\nwith it. The best windows left are six lancets in the ambulatory of the\r\ncathedral. They belong to the XIII-century school of Chartres and are\r\nexceptional in being the only signed windows; \"Clement of Chartres\" was\r\ntheir maker. The first, given by a company of boatmen, relates the\r\nlegend of St. Julian Hospitator, who ferried strangers day and night\r\nover the river, a story recounted by Gustave Flaubert, a son of\r\nRouen.[349] The other five lancets are of the _Biblia pauperum_ type,\r\nteaching dogma to the people. The cold, limpid hues of the XIV century\r\nappear in the Lady chapel, and in the chapel of St. Jeanne d'Arc is an\r\ninteresting Pentecost window of that century; contemporary are the apse\r\nlights in the upper choir, where the unsuccessful experiment was tried\r\nof continuing the subject from one panel to another--here the arms of\r\nthe Crucified Lord extend into the lateral lights. The cathedral's west\r\nrose is of the XV century; in the transept is a XVI-century window\r\ndevoted to the ancient bishop Romanus. The abbatial of St. Ouen has,\r\nwith the choir of Évreux, the best array extant of XIV-century canopy\r\nglass figures. So loath were the vitrine artists to give up an\r\narchitectural design in glass that when the XV century composed scenes\r\ninstead of single figures for each panel, even those small groups were\r\nset in grisaille frames.\r\n\r\nThe iconoclastic 1562 worked havoc in Rouen. For twenty-four hours a\r\nHuguenot mob wrecked tombs, altars, and windows in the cathedral, to\r\nsuch an extent that it lay unused during half a year. One mourns the\r\nloss of the cenotaph of good Charles V, made in 1369 by the same Jean de\r\nMarville who designed the famous Dijon tomb of the king's brother. Ten\r\nyears later, in 1572, the Rouen Catholics retaliated by massacring some\r\neight hundred Calvinists in the city on St. Bartholomew's Day.\r\n\r\nIn the World War Rouen became almost an English city again. This time,\r\nhowever, England, the ancient combatant of France, came not as a\r\ndetested invader, but as her ally in dire years of distress. It is\r\npleasant to learn that devotion to the Maid of Orleans was not\r\ninfrequent among the English troops of 1914-18.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEANNE D'ARC'S TRIAL IN ROUEN[350]\r\n\r\n     De ma part, je répute son histoire un vrai miracle le Dieu. La\r\n     pudicité que je vois l'avoir accompagnée jusques à sa mort, même au\r\n     milieu des troupes; la juste querelle qu'elle prit; la prouesse\r\n     qu'elle y apporta; les heureux succès de ses affaires; la sage\r\n     simplicité que je recueille de ses réponses au interrogatoires qui\r\n     lui furent faits par les juges du tout voués à sa ruine; ses\r\n     prédictions qui, depuis, sortirent effet; la mort cruelle qu'elle\r\n     choisit dont elle se pouvoit garantir s'il y eût de la feintise en\r\n     son fait; tout cela dis-je, me fait croire (joint les voyes du ciel\r\n     quelle oyoit) que toute sa vie et histoire fut un vrai martyre de\r\n     Dieu.--Testimony of ÉTIENNE PASQUIER (1529-1615).\r\n\r\nSo swiftly followed the fruitage of the sacrifice offered up in the\r\nVieux-Marché on May 21, 1431, that in every part of the ancient city of\r\nRouen sprang up exuberant, vigorous, Flamboyant monuments. The most\r\nmomentous and the saddest happening in the history of Normandy's capital\r\nwas the burning at the stake of Jeanne la Pucelle whose relief of\r\nOrléans, only two short years before, had saved the nation in its last\r\ngasp.\r\n\r\nFrom the church of St. Saviour on the market place they brought her the\r\ncross for which she begged on that tragic morning, that the pillory on\r\nwhich her Lord had hung might be held up before her eyes, to strengthen\r\nher in her last hour. Long afterward, in 1450, Massieu, the\r\npriest-sheriff of her trial, a weak man but less unsympathetic than many\r\nin that grim gathering of rascals, testified: \"The English feared her\r\nmore than the whole army of the king of France.... It was they who held\r\nthe trial and paid its costs. She was taken to the Viel-Marché, having\r\nbeside her Brother Martin and me, and accompanied by more than eight\r\nhundred men at arms, with spears and swords. On the way she made pious\r\nlamentation so touchingly that my companion and I could not keep back\r\nour tears. She recommended her soul to God and the saints with such\r\ndevotion that those who heard her wept. All distressed, she exclaimed,\r\n'Rouen, Rouen, must I die here!'\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Old Market was reached Jeanne heard herself sermonized as a\r\nlimb of Satan, a blasphemer guilty of diabolical malice, of pernicious\r\ncrimes, and infected with the leprosy of heresy. Her sentence read, she\r\nfell on her knees and addressed to God prayers so ardent that even the\r\nforeign masters of Rouen were moved. Her dear St. Michael she\r\npetitioned, too. \"As soon as the flames reached her,\" relates an\r\neyewitness, \"she cried out more than six times, '_Jhésus!_' and then a\r\nfinal time, in a loud voice, with her last breath, '_Jhésus!_' And her\r\ncry was heard from end to end of the market place, and almost everyone\r\nwas weeping.... A shiver passed over the assembly.... The people pointed\r\nat her judges and said that Jeanne was the victim of a great\r\ninjustice.... They murmured that such an evil deed should have taken\r\nplace in their city.... That evening the executioner went to the\r\nDominican convent and confessed in fear, 'I have burned a saint!'... The\r\nsecretary of the English king turned away from the lamentable spectacle,\r\nmuttering: 'We are lost. We have burned a saint!\" Surrounded by her\r\nbrutal jailers, at dawn that May morning, Jeanne had said, with\r\nconfidence, \"With God's aid, I shall be this night in His Kingdom of\r\nParadise.\" As her final cry to her Redeemer rang out, a canon of Rouen\r\nCathedral prayed aloud, \"Would to God my soul were where I believe is\r\nthe soul of this Maid.\"\r\n\r\nThe young priest-secretary, the clerk of the court, Manchon, who took\r\ndown her trial (and let his irresistible admiration for her run over in\r\nmarginal notes, \"_Superba responsio!_\"), testified later: \"Never did I\r\nweep so much over any grief that has come to me, and for a month I could\r\nnot be appeased. I bought a little missal with the money that came to me\r\nfrom the trial, that I might have cause to remember her in my prayers.\"\r\nThe verdict of all impartial men in Rouen, that somber May morning of\r\n1431, was that the whole business from beginning to end had been\r\nviolence and injustice.[351]\r\n\r\nA packed jury had judged her. The president of the tribunal, the\r\nrenegade selected to prove a saint a sorceress, was Bishop Pierre\r\nCauchon, driven from his see of Beauvais by loyal Frenchmen, as the\r\nenemy of his own country. Because the see of Rouen was unoccupied, the\r\nEnglish preferred to hold Jeanne's trial there rather than at Paris,\r\nwhere the bishop was not their creature. How abject a tool Cauchon was\r\nis to-day shown by old receipts which prove that he was the recipient,\r\non each day of the trial, of a hundred _sols tournois_. For the same\r\nignoble reason many a learned professor \"charged his soul.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not the faintest shadow of fair play in the process. After\r\nMaître Jean Lohier had said to Cauchon that the proceedings were not\r\nvalid because Jeanne was allowed no counsel, nor were the hearings in\r\npublic court, and those present had not freedom to express their true\r\nopinion, that honest Norman lawyer saw that his only safety lay in\r\nquitting the city. \"It is an affair of hate,\" he said to young\r\nSecretary Manchon one day as they stood together in Rouen Cathedral.\r\n\"Deliberately they try to trap her. If only she would not say in regard\r\nto her apparitions, 'I know for certain,' but, 'It seems to me,' I do\r\nnot see how she could be condemned.\"\r\n\r\nSome canons of the cathedral who criticized the trial were thrown into\r\nprison, and the English locked up a citizen who remarked that since\r\nJeanne had been judged innocent by the doctors at Poitiers, in a court\r\npresided over by the archbishop of Rheims, a second trial was illegal.\r\nThree of the younger judges who at first dared to give their true\r\nopinion were berated by Cauchon, who bade them quit their ecclesiastical\r\nquibbling and let the jurists decide the matter. The testimony of the\r\naged bishop of Avranches, then a resident of Rouen, was set aside\r\nbecause he advised that in matters doubtful touching the faith the case\r\nshould be referred to a council or to the pope. Because Massieu, the\r\nhumble court usher, said to a townsman, \"I can see nothing but goodness\r\nand honor in her,\" he was threatened with a prison cell where never\r\nagain would he see sun or moon. The secretaries, Manchon and\r\nBoisguillaume, were beaten by the English. A man on the street who spoke\r\nwell of Jeanne was chased by Lord Warwick with a drawn sword and almost\r\nkilled. Passions ran high. Lord Stafford drew his dagger on Jeanne in\r\nher cell one day because she said that the English would be driven out\r\nof France. Even after her execution, when a Dominican in the city spoke\r\nkindly of her, he was flung into prison for a year.\r\n\r\nHer judges sought to tire Jeanne out by long hours of interrogation; the\r\nlawyers themselves came away exhausted from the sessions. Virulent\r\nagainst her was Beaupère, rector of Paris University, who, when routed\r\nby the young girl's replies, called her sly. When Cauchon wished to have\r\nit appear that she refused to submit to the Church, he made the scribes\r\nomit her statement that gladly she appealed to a general council or to\r\nthe pope. \"Ah,\" cried Jeanne, \"you write all that is against me, but you\r\ndo not write anything for me.\" The lawyers' subtle questions rained on\r\nher thick and fast till she would call them to order with admirable\r\ncourtesy, \"_Beaux seigneurs, faites l'un après l'autre_.\" Whenever she\r\nwished to make no reply to a question came her concise, \"_Passez\r\noutre_.\" Secretary Manchon testified before an inquest, twenty years\r\nlater, \"Never could Jeanne have defended herself as she did in so\r\ndifficult a cause, against so many and such learned doctors, if she had\r\nnot been inspired.\"\r\n\r\nSublime to tears are some of the answers made by this young country girl\r\nnot yet twenty, who could barely read and write, who knew only _Pater_\r\nand _Ave_. When sheeringly asked were she in a state of grace, she\r\nreplied: \"A serious question to answer. If I am, may God keep me so; if\r\nI am not, may God put me in his grace. I would rather die than not have\r\nGod's love.\" Awe fell on the assemblage and for that day the session\r\nbroke up.[352]\r\n\r\nYet Jeanne was very human at her trial, too. It was just the\r\nwell-brought-up country maid, the Jeannette they all loved in Domrémy,\r\nwho boasted before those callous men: \"For sewing and for spinning, I\r\nfear no woman in Rouen.\" Those housewives of Rouen, the \"little people\r\nof the Lord,\" to whom Jeanne's thoughts turned in homely fashion, dared\r\nonly murmur beneath their breath that her process was \"a crying\r\ninjustice,\" and shame it was that so evil a _cause célèbre_ should take\r\nplace in their good town. Rouen was terrorized into silence by her\r\nforeign master.\r\n\r\nJeanne's five months' imprisonment and final execution at Rouen was a\r\npolitical crime covered with the cloak of religious zeal by a very\r\ngenius of hypocrisy. John Plantagenet, Duke of Bedford, together with\r\nthe boy king's great-uncle, the cardinal of Winchester, were the movers\r\nbehind the scenes. Jeanne never quitted her prison in the castle built\r\nby Philippe-Auguste--only a tower of which is extant to-day. From that\r\nstronghold the English governed Normandy. Since the opening of the\r\nWorld War an erroneous inscription, placed by partisan politicians in\r\nthe wall of the episcopal palace of Rouen, has been changed, for it\r\nsought to convey the idea that from the prelate's court of justice\r\nJeanne was led forth to her death. Never did she set foot in that\r\nofficiality building; she was held from the first day to the last in an\r\nEnglish prison. From a dark cell in the tower fortress she was conducted\r\nthrough corridors of the same castle to the hall where sat her judges.\r\nMassieu, the usher, used to let her slip into the castle chapel for an\r\n_Ave_ as she passed its open door, but even that solace was stopped by\r\nEstivet. That venomous agent of Cauchon accused Jeanne of ironic replies\r\nill suited to a woman.[353]\r\n\r\nCauchon tried to coerce the young priest-secretaries of the trial,\r\nManchon and Boisguillaume, to falsify their notes, but they proved\r\nincorruptible. And twenty years later they, with Massieu, became the\r\nchief vindicators of the Maid when the inquests for her rehabilitation\r\nwere started. Jeanne had felt their unspoken sympathy. Once with\r\npleasant humor she told them not to ask her the same question twice or\r\nshe would pull their ears. We know from contemporaries that Jeanne's way\r\nof intercourse was natural and friendly, _enjouée_, that her attitude\r\nwas modesty itself, that her voice had a feminine note of sweetness,\r\nthat she was strong and comely and well shaped, that her hair was dark.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1412, by the Meuse, in Domrémy, on the old Roman road from\r\nLangres to Verdun, in French territory, on the borders of Champagne and\r\nLorraine, she was not yet eighteen when she crossed the ravaged land in\r\nthe winter of 1429 to rouse Charles VII, then in Chinon Castle. In March\r\nof that year she raised the siege of Orléans; in July she witnessed the\r\ncoronation of her \"_gentil dauphin_\" at Rheims; in September occurred\r\nthe assault on Paris, from which siege Charles VII, counseled by\r\ntraitors, retired, and all winter Jeanne was kept in semiactivity,\r\nthough chafing to free the land from the foreign yoke. Especially she\r\nlonged to go to the aid of the besieged Mont-Saint-Michel, and to\r\nliberate from his English prison the poet-duke of Orléans, even, she\r\nsaid, if it meant going to London Tower itself. In May, 1430, she was\r\ncaptured by her enemies, the Burgundians. Jeanne's active mission\r\ncovered only a year. \"Several times in my presence,\" testified the Duke\r\nd'Alençon,[354] her companion in arms, \"Jeanne told the king she would\r\nlast but a year, and to look well that he made right use of her.\" But\r\nCharles VII failed her.\r\n\r\nAfter her capture Jeanne spent some months in prisons in northern\r\nFrance, and finally she was sold to the English for a king's ransom.\r\nNever in their minds was there any mistake as to who had turned the tide\r\nagainst them. \"They had for her a mortal hate,\" said, in later years,\r\nPierre Minier, one of the judges cowed by the Duke of Bedford; \"they\r\nthirsted to bring about her death, no matter by what means.\"\r\n\r\nFrom December, 1430, to May, 1431, Jeanne's martyrdom at Rouen endured.\r\n\"An iron cage was made for her, and at night she was chained up,\"\r\ndeclared Secretary Boisguillaume, at the inquest of 1450. \"She was\r\nincarcerated in Rouen Castle; her guardians were English soldiery of the\r\nlowest type; day and night they kept watch ... they made her the object\r\nof their mockeries; often she reproached them for it. Her feet were held\r\nin irons which were attached to a post.\" There were scenes in that dark\r\ncell, vouched for by witnesses, which are too painful to\r\ntranscribe.[355] Only when she fell ill was the severity with which she\r\nwas treated relaxed, lest by a natural death she escape public burning.\r\nOne day Estivet so vilified her that she had a relapse of fever. Every\r\ndetail is set down in the process for her rehabilitation, for which the\r\nDominican Bréhal traveled from end to end of France, gathering testimony\r\nfrom those who had known Jeanne. But the chief instrument of her\r\nvindication is the word-for-word record of her trial at Rouen in 1431.\r\nNot in all history is there a more personal and appealing document. One\r\ncan hear Jeanne's very accent in her valiant replies to her tormentors.\r\n\"_Répondes hardiment_,\" her voices admonished her.\r\n\r\nWhy did Charles VII, who, before Jeanne appeared, was about to pass into\r\nforeign exile, strike no blow to rescue her who had given him back his\r\nkingdom? A difficult question to answer. Charles was no hero, though his\r\nquality of perseverance was ultimately to make him the instrument that\r\nended the centuries-old Capet-Plantagenet duel. Charles was surrounded\r\nby counselors who were jealous of Jeanne's leadership, who represented\r\nher captivity as the result of her headstrong character.\r\n\r\nIn 1449 Charles, _le bien servi_, but not the duly grateful, entered\r\nRouen \"in triumph and magnificence as never king in city.\" Bells rang\r\nout and children cried, \"_Noël!_\" in welcome. In the cathedral the\r\nfestal throng gathered. Beside the king stood Jacques Coeur, the\r\nmerchant-prince, who had provided the funds for the reconquest of\r\nNormandy, and whose splendor of apparel on this triumphal entry was so\r\nto excite the barons' envy that within four years their machinations had\r\nhim impeached, despoiled, and banished. He who was building at Bourges\r\nthe finest bourgeois mansion in France, must have observed with interest\r\nthe host of Flamboyant monuments then arising in Rouen. With Charles VII\r\ncame, too, his commander in chief, the great Dunois, who had fought with\r\nJeanne, the half brother of the Duke of Orléans, who that day was\r\nsinging:\r\n\r\n    \"Resjoys-toy, franc royaume de France!\r\n     À présent Dieu pour toy se combat.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Normandy was again French, not many years were to pass before Rouen\r\nexonerated herself of the crime of Jeanne's execution. The chief mover\r\nof the rehabilitation was the archbishop of the city, the Norman,\r\nGuillaume d'Estouteville, son of the hero who in 1415 held Harfleur\r\nagainst the entire army of Henry V, brother of the knight who led the\r\ndefense of Mont-Saint-Michel, and nephew of Archbishop d'Harcourt, who\r\ngave up his see of Rouen to live in exile, rather than swear fealty to a\r\nnon-French master. Cardinal d'Estouteville saw the propriety of clearing\r\nnot only Normandy but France and the Church of what had been the\r\npolitical crime of foreigners. Through his efforts Pope Calixtus III, in\r\n1456, revoked the legal decision of 1431, as \"iniquitous, malicious,\r\ncalumnious, and fraudulent.\" The unworthy Cauchon was excommunicated. A\r\nformal reading of the sentence of rehabilitation took place in the big\r\nhall of Rouen's episcopal palace: \"Considering the quality of the judges\r\nand of those who directed the trial, considering that her abjuration was\r\nextorted by fraud and violence, in presence of the executioner and under\r\nthreat of fire, without the accused understanding its full content and\r\nterms, considering finally that the crimes charged against her are not\r\nproven whatsoever by the process\"--thus runs the decree declaring\r\nJeanne's two sentences of condemnation in 1431 to be the work of\r\niniquity. It was ordered that the rehabilitation be read publicly, not\r\nalone in Rouen, but in all the chief towns of France.\r\n\r\nRouen celebrated with gladness the justice rendered to the Maid who had\r\nsaved France in her darkest hour. A solemn procession, in which marched\r\nJeanne's brothers, who had been ennobled by the king, proceeded to the\r\ngraveyard beside St. Ouen's abbatial, where, twenty-five years earlier,\r\nJeanne had sat alone on a platform above the crowd, just a week before\r\nher execution. They had there read to her the twelve\r\naccusations--dubbing her witch and wanton--which a doctor of Paris\r\nUniversity had drawn up, and then a preacher thundered in vituperation.\r\nJeanne listened gently till she heard Charles VII abused, whereupon she,\r\nwho had the mystic cult of royalty, lifted up her head bravely: \"By my\r\nfaith, sire,\" she cried, \"my king is a noble Christian. Say what you\r\nwill of me, but leave my king alone.\" \"Hush her up!\" angrily cried\r\nCauchon.\r\n\r\nIn that cemetery of St. Ouen occurred what now is called proper\r\nself-defense on Jeanne's part. She could write her name, but with a\r\nsmile she signed with a circle, emblem of mockery, and a cross, meaning\r\nnegation. She hoped to be transferred to the prisons of the Church,\r\nwhere she clamored to be placed. Jeanne signed a paper consisting of\r\nseven lines, and afterward they produced an abjuration of fifty lines.\r\nHer judge might be a bishop, but never once did she confuse the Church\r\nshe revered and the unworthy clerics who sat in judgment on her. During\r\nthe ceremonies of the rehabilitation at Rouen, a great procession\r\nmarched to the Old Market where had stood Jeanne's funeral pyre, and\r\nwith solemnity the twelve accusations against her were torn into shreds\r\nand burned. Rouen felt happier after rendering that justice, and her\r\nrenewed self-respect found natural expression in her Flamboyant Gothic\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\nHowever, many a long year was to go by before France fully comprehended\r\nthe martyr of Rouen. Voltaire libeled Jeanne as vilely as the XV-century\r\nsavants of Paris University. The rationalists of a later day have\r\npatronized her as self-hallucinated. But the tide has mounted. \"The day\r\nthat all the bells of the world ring in honor of Jeanne d'Arc, they will\r\nsound abroad the glory of France,\" said Leo XIII, in 1896. The Maid of\r\nDomrémy-on-the-Meuse was declared Venerable in 1904, Blessed in 1909,\r\nand canonized a saint in 1920. _St. Jeanne d'Arc, ora pro nobis!_\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF LISIEUX[356]\r\n\r\n     One must live as one thinks, or else, sooner or later, one finishes\r\n     by thinking as one lives.--PAUL BOURGET.\r\n\r\nLisieux Cathedral is, with that of Rouen, the least Norman in the\r\nprovince. It claims to be the first built of the Gothic cathedrals of\r\nNormandy and the most vigorous. The preceding Romanesque cathedral was\r\ngrievously damaged by fire in 1136. Arnoul, a prelate who had gone\r\nthrough the disillusioning experience of the Second Crusade, began the\r\npresent church. Similarities between it and Laon Cathedral, and various\r\nother indications, prove that it was building from 1160 to 1190.\r\n\r\nBishop Arnoul, of a line of shrewd Norman diplomatists, profited\r\nmaterially by his ability to keep on good terms with both husbands of\r\nAliénor of Aquitaine, Henry of England, and Louis of France. In Lisieux\r\nCathedral he married Aliénor to Henry II, which act was to take three\r\nhundred years of war and Jeanne's sacrifice to undo. Arnoul was the\r\nEnglish king's chief adviser before Becket's ascendancy. It is said that\r\nhe counseled Henry, after his first quarrel with Becket, to detach one\r\nby one the English bishops from their primate, which policy of _divide\r\net impera_ came only too easily to an Angevin-Anglo-Norman. Four times\r\ndid Bishop Arnoul journey to Sens to negotiate for Henry with the pope,\r\nduring the Becket controversy. Some of the leading men of his day\r\nadmired the prelate of Lisieux; but soundly honest men such as Abbot\r\nRobert de Torigny of the Mount, and the bishop of Chartres, John of\r\nSalisbury, distrusted him entirely--the latter remarked on his political\r\nsense in bestowing benefits when he wished to convince a man of his\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nUnder Bishop Arnoul the nave of Lisieux rose in one campaign, a monument\r\nsevere and pure, fog-colored like the wintry sky over it, say the\r\ntownsmen. A note of force is imparted by the sturdy cylindrical piers.\r\nThere is a narthex bay at the western end--a Germanic influence. No\r\ntrace of vaulting shows in the deep gallery over the aisles, though the\r\ntriforium arches that open on the central vessel are better suited for a\r\ntribune than a blind arcade. Behind that arcade now stands a poorly\r\nconstructed wall opened here and there by doors, reminding us that once\r\nit was the custom for crusaders to store their valuables in the upper\r\ngalleries of cathedrals.\r\n\r\nSome have suggested that Guillaume de Sens was the architect of Lisieux,\r\nwhose resemblances with his known works at Sens and Canterbury are\r\ndiscernible. Lisieux adhered to the Romanesque tradition of salient\r\ntransept arms; that to the north lacks a portal; that to the south is an\r\nexcellent example of plainest Primary Gothic. The transept has an\r\neastern aisle, an arrangement found at Durham, Lincoln, Salisbury, and\r\nPeterborough. The first two bays of the choir were built, like the nave,\r\nin the XII century; the birth of the apse is marked by a staircase, as\r\nat Caen, Boscherville, Fécamp, and Eu.\r\n\r\nThe ample central tower of Lisieux, not in the first plan, was erected\r\nas the choir was gradually extended. In the later-constructed straight\r\nbays of the choir, and at the apse, finished under Bishop Jourdain du\r\nHommet, no annulets broke the ascending line of the clustered shafts,\r\nquatrefoils were cut in the spandrels, and more and more the structure\r\ntook on regional characteristics. Arches were set under arches, some of\r\nthem being acutely pointed, because the Norman preferred to use the same\r\nopening of the compass for all his arches, wide or narrow. It gave his\r\neye pleasure to multiply molds, and his sense of exactitude craved a\r\nsupport for every roll molding. Lisieux' choir, however, avoided what\r\nwas to become an excessive complication of parts in the Anglo-Norman\r\nschool. The cathedral is essentially vigorous and severe.\r\n\r\nIn 1226 a fire necessitated repairs, and Bishop Guillaume de\r\nPont-de-l'Arche took the opportunity to make three ambulatory chapels.\r\nHe built the façade towers whose lower walls retained Romanesque parts\r\nof the XI century. When the southwest tower fell in 1553 it was replaced\r\nby one of pre-Gothic design. The northwest belfry had as prototype the\r\nfamous one of St. Pierre at Caen. The axis chapel--longer than the\r\nXIII-century one it replaced--is a gem of Flamboyant art. On its walls\r\nare some small funereal bas-reliefs erected by the cathedral canons.\r\n\r\nThe builder of Lisieux' Lady chapel was Pierre Cauchon, president of the\r\ntribunal that sentenced Jeanne d'Arc to death. He did not erect his\r\nchapel, as some intimate, in expiation of his conduct at Rouen in 1431,\r\nfor he remained to the end the creature of his country's invaders. His\r\ndetestation of Jeanne, moreover, was a personal affair, since it had\r\nbeen her triumph at Orléans, creating a national hope, that put heart\r\ninto the citizens of Beauvais to expel their pro-English bishop. The\r\nEnglish sent him to buy Jeanne from her captors. After the happenings in\r\nSt. Ouen's cemetery, by law Jeanne should have been passed into the\r\ncontrol of the Church, but Cauchon ordered her back to her English\r\nprison, and when she again donned male attire, and again asserted that\r\nshe had heard her voices, her unscrupulous enemies were enabled to\r\naccuse her of being a relapsed heretic and wanton, to start a new trial,\r\nand condemn her to death. Cauchon himself hastened to the fortress to\r\nwitness Jeanne's \"relapse,\" and with Lord Warwick he is said to have\r\nchuckled over it--\"This time she's well caught!\" The morning that Jeanne\r\nwas led to her execution she faced Cauchon fearlessly: \"Bishop, I die by\r\nyour hand. Had I been placed in the prisons of the Church, this would\r\nnever have happened. You have left me in the clutches of my enemies. I\r\ncall you before God, the great judge, to answer for the wrong you have\r\ndone me.\" Even as she so spoke a spirited statue now represents Jeanne\r\nin Cauchon's Norman cathedral, while her judge is a condemned felon\r\nbefore the bar of history.\r\n\r\nLike Arnoul, builder of Lisieux' nave, Cauchon knew how to act a better\r\npart. As rector of Paris University he had been esteemed for his\r\nlearning. But, coming to the parting of the ways, he chose the broad and\r\neasy path, and the rest followed. His influence encouraged the\r\nUniversity of Paris in its pernicious betrayal of France after Henry V's\r\ninvasion. Cauchon won the see of Beauvais by defending Jean Sans Peur of\r\nBurgundy, in 1407, when the latter had murdered his cousin, the Duke of\r\nOrléans,[357] in the streets of Paris. And in the same hour that he thus\r\ntruckled for advancement, Jean Gerson, the chancellor of Paris\r\nUniversity, denounced the ducal crime--destined to be for France of\r\nincalculable consequence--and had his house sacked by Burgundians.\r\n\r\nTen years later, at the Council of Constances, in Switzerland Cauchon\r\nupheld the murderer, and Gerson rebuked the crime, whereupon he felt it\r\nto be wiser to quit Constances in disguise and to pass his latter life\r\nin retirement. Cauchon became the butcher of Jeanne d'Arc, his name\r\nforever an infamy; Gerson, dying in poverty and defeat at Lyons, was\r\nthought worthy, during two centuries, to be called the author of the\r\n_Imitation of Christ_, and before he passed away in July, 1429, it was\r\ngiven to him to learn that the Maid had triumphed at Orléans, and to\r\ntestify that her mission was of God: _Gratia Dei estensa est in hac\r\npuella; a Domino factum est istud_.\r\n\r\nCauchon, ex-bishop of Beauvais, having placed his learning and energies\r\nat the service of his country's invaders, ambitiously hoped to obtain\r\nRouen as his thirty pieces of silver, but the Duke of Bedford\r\ncompromised matters by bestowing on him the lesser see of Lisieux, in\r\n1432. As the national cause prospered the traitor was more and more\r\ndetested by the populace. When the Burgundian partisans of the English\r\nwere expelled from Paris, the properties of the bishop of Lisieux in the\r\ncapital were seized and he himself was mobbed. In 1442 he fell dead\r\nsuddenly one day while his barber was shaving him. A few years later,\r\nwhen Jeanne was rehabilitated and her judge excommunicated, the populace\r\nbroke open Cauchon's tomb in the cathedral and flung his bones into the\r\nmire. His successor at Lisieux, Bishop Pasquier de Vaux, also one of\r\nJeanne's faithless judges, died alone, deserted, on the day that the\r\nFrench army entered his city as victors, in 1449. The after history of\r\nLisieux Cathedral followed the same course as others in France; 1562 and\r\n1793 wrecked its monuments and smashed its stained glass. In the\r\nFlamboyant Gothic church of St. Jacques--where not a capital breaks the\r\nascending line--are some XVI-century windows, making it the first church\r\nwith such remaining.\r\n\r\nLisieux can boast of no bishop canonized by the Church, but her citizens\r\nare doing all in their power to let Christendom know of the gentle\r\nNorman girl, Thérèse Martin, the \"Little Flower,\" who died in the odor\r\nof sanctity (1897) in the Carmelite convent of the town, before she had\r\nreached her twenty-fifth year. Her extraordinary cult, especially among\r\nsoldiers during the World War, proves that the thirst for sainthood is\r\nas strong as ever in the peoples who went crusading and flung themselves\r\ntoward heaven in cathedrals. Art springs from emotions such as that felt\r\nby Frenchmen for the \"Little Flower.\" To ignore such manifestations, as\r\ndo the rationalists who still are insisting, as dogmatically as before\r\n1914, that France, at root, is the land of Voltaire, is a willful\r\nshutting of the eyes to the basic forces that make history.\r\n\r\nThose good people of Lisieux who are mystic-minded, who _believe in\r\norder that they may understand_, as Anselm taught at Bec near by, as\r\nPlato taught in Greece, feel subconsciously that their \"Little Flower,\"\r\nwho said that only after her death would begin her real mission, is\r\natoning for Pierre Cauchon.[358]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF ÉVREUX[359]\r\n\r\n     Il en coûte cher pour devenir la France. Nous nous plaignons, et\r\n     non sans droit, de nos épreuves et de nos mécomptes. Nos pères\r\n     n'ont pas vécu plus doucement que nous, ni recueilli plus tôt et à\r\n     meilleur marché les fruits de leurs travaux. Il y a dans le\r\n     spectacle de leurs destinées de quoi s'attrister et se fortifier à\r\n     la fois. L'histoire abat les prétentions impatientes et soutient\r\n     les longues espérances.--GUIZOT.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Évreux is not homogeneous like that of Lisieux, but,\r\ngathering of different styles though it is, Romanesque, Gothic, early\r\nand late, neo-classic, it possesses its own distinct personality. A\r\nchurch of whose choir it has been said by one so competent to compare\r\nthe cathedrals of his native land as M. Louis Gonse, that it is \"one of\r\nthe fairest bits of Gothic architecture in France,\" surely can hold its\r\nown among more brilliant companions.\r\n\r\nTwo Romanesque edifices stood in succession on the site, not to speak of\r\nthe Merovingian and Carolingian cathedrals here. Évreux is the _Evora_\r\nof Gallo-Roman times when it was ranked with Rouen and Tours. St.\r\nPatrick came hither in 432 for his consecration as bishop before his\r\napostolate to Ireland. The first of the Romanesque cathedrals was\r\ndedicated in 1072 by Archbishop Lanfranc of Canterbury, but in 1119,\r\nwhen Henry I of England was besieging the city, it was destroyed for\r\nstrategic purposes, by consent of its bishop, who was in the king's\r\ncamp. Henry and all his barons gave generous compensation, we are told\r\nby Ordericus Vitalis, the English monk who spent most of his life in the\r\nNorman monastery of St. Évroult, \"delighting in obedience and poverty,\"\r\nwriting a history which is the chief XII-century record of the duchy.\r\n\r\nThe second Romanesque cathedral was begun in 1126. To it belonged the\r\npier arcade of the present nave and the entire westernmost bay, as well\r\nas portions of the façade towers. At one time it was thought that the\r\narches adjacent to the transept were part of the earlier church blessed\r\nby Lanfranc, inasmuch as they differ from the profiles of the other pier\r\narches. Further study has demonstrated, however, that the entire arcade\r\nbelongs to the XII century, since it was not the usage, before 1120, to\r\nflank a pier's four faces by columns, as was done here throughout.\r\n\r\nThe second Romanesque cathedral of Évreux was also destined to be of\r\nshort duration. In 1194, Philippe-Auguste laid the city in ashes as\r\nchastisement for John Lackland's black deed. John had allowed a French\r\ngarrison into Évreux during his intrigues with the French king, while\r\nRichard the Lion-hearted was on his crusade. When word came that his\r\nbrother was returning to his possessions, John, hoping to placate him\r\nfor his own treachery, invited the French garrison of three hundred to a\r\nfeast and, it is said, foully murdered them all. The bishop of Évreux\r\nhad accompanied Richard Coeur-de-Lion to the East and in Cyprus had\r\ncrowned his bride, Berengaria of Navarre. In the course of time the\r\ncounts of Évreux became kings of Navarre, through the marriage of\r\nBerengaria's sister to the Count of Champagne.[360] The niece of Richard\r\nand John, Blanche of Castile, brought in her dowry Évreux to the French\r\nCrown, when she married (1200) the son of that wily augmenter,\r\nPhilippe-Auguste.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of the cathedral as Gothic proceeded slowly. By 1230 the\r\nnave had merely reached the triforium level. A horizontal sculptured\r\nband, such as surmounts it, was not used after that date. The clearstory\r\nof the nave is contemporary with the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, and when\r\nLouis IX came to his mother's dower city, in 1259, for the consecration\r\nof its bishop, who was his personal friend, he and the group of\r\nbuilding-prelates with him, from Rheims, Rouen, Coutances, and Séez,\r\nmust have discussed the new works at Évreux with interest. The choir of\r\nthe cathedral was not undertaken till the close of the century. From\r\n1298 to 1310 it was built in a Rayonnant style fully as advanced as the\r\nlater abbatial of St. Ouen, at Rouen, with glazed triforium, capitals\r\nthat are slight bands of foliage, and precocious prismatic profiles. The\r\nonly distinctly Norman trait is the balustrade of the triforium. As the\r\nchoir was made fifteen feet wider than the nave, its westernmost bay was\r\ncanted to join the transept, but the effect is not displeasing.\r\n\r\nThe Hundred Years' War caused a cessation of works at Évreux. Dire years\r\nwere they for the city ruled by Charles le Mauvais, a \"demon of\r\nFrance,\" \"perfidy in person.\" He plotted ceaselessly against the\r\nnational party, not because he leaned to the English side, but that he\r\nwas obsessed by his own superior claims to the French crown, being by\r\nboth father and mother directly of St. Louis' line. His high\r\nabilities--and he was learned, eloquent, and handsome--were wasted in\r\nmischief making. In 1365 he gave up his city of Évreux to the flames.\r\nCharles the Wicked is pictured in the cathedral's clearstory windows, in\r\nthe fourth on the north side of the choir, and across the sanctuary from\r\nhim, in another light, is his wife, a Valois, sister of the French king,\r\nCharles V, and his art-loving brothers at Dijon, Angers, and Bourges.\r\nShe possessed Mantes by her dower right, and added to its collegiate\r\nchurch the Rayonnant chapel of Navarre, in which are portrait statuettes\r\nrepresenting her daughters. Her four brothers, says M. Anthyme\r\nSaint-Paul, were the paramount influences in the formation of French\r\nFlamboyant Gothic, from 1365 to 1415.\r\n\r\nThe best array of XIV-century glass[361] in France is that of the choir\r\nof Évreux. The windows are not forceful, like XIII-century\r\nmedallion-mosaics, any more than the Rayonnant stonework framing them\r\nresembles hardy Apogee Gothic. The hues, while limpid and pleasing, show\r\nnone of the lovely half-tones which the Flamboyant-Renaissance day was\r\nto achieve. Large plates of glass were employed in order that fewer\r\nleads might darken the window. White was overused, as well as the\r\nrecently discovered yellow, called silver-stain, obtained by fusing the\r\nsurface of white glass with a solution of silver. Pot-metal glass--that\r\ncolored in the mass--had hitherto been used exclusively. Effective\r\nbackgrounds were obtained by damasked patterns. In each panel was a\r\nsingle figure in an architectural setting of grisaille and\r\nsilver-stain, which frames grew so elaborate, by the middle of the\r\ncentury, that perspective was represented.\r\n\r\nThe earliest example of a canopy type of window is in Évreux' upper\r\nchoir--the third light on the north side. It was the gift of the _grand\r\nqueux_, or cook, of France, Guillaume d'Harcourt, who died in 1327. The\r\ntwo windows presented by the bishop of Évreux, Bernard Cariti (1376-83),\r\nshow progress in architectural backgrounds, and the donor is drawn from\r\nlife. In the canted bay of the choir (north) is a XV-century window of\r\nthe Saintes Maries, whose alleged relics were given to the bishop here\r\nby good King René of Anjou. The window commemorates Normandy's newly\r\nacquired freedom, hence its portraits of Charles VII, his son, the\r\nfuture Louis XI, and the seneschal of Normandy, Pierre de Brézé. It is\r\nalso a memorial of the Great Schism of the West, ended by the Council of\r\nConstance, at which the bishop of Évreux was present. Foliate designs\r\ncover the grisaille lights of the triforium. The quarries (white,\r\nparallel pieces of glass framed together in a lead pattern) are\r\nenlivened by strips of colored glass and heraldic ornament.\r\n\r\nLouis XI built the Lady chapel of Évreux, in whose windows he depicted\r\nhis coronation. In the lily-petals formed by the Flamboyant tracery of\r\nthe mullions are pictured the barons who attended the king's investing.\r\nInstead of the single figures in each panel, hitherto popular, small\r\ngroups were now set under the vitrine canopies, and subjects heretofore\r\nunknown in western iconography appeared, such as the Transfiguration,\r\nthe Woman of Samaria, the Marriage at Cana. They were pictured just as\r\nthe mystery plays of the day presented them on the stage. In the Tree of\r\nJesse, at the end of the chapel, the new process of abrasion was\r\nemployed, by which the color of flashed glass was ground away in places,\r\nand on the white surfaces thus exposed were enameled new colors, so that\r\none piece of glass could exhibit a variety of hues. These windows of\r\nÉvreux' Lady chapel belong to the transition hour between the earlier\r\ntradition that treated a window as an adjunct of the architecture, and\r\nthe later tradition that composed a window as an independent painted\r\npicture.[362]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1441, Évreux opened its gates joyously to the national troops,\r\nnew works were begun in the cathedral. The actual Flamboyant transept\r\nwas substituted for a decrepit Romanesque structure, whose ground plan\r\nit followed, hence it is too narrow for its height; seen from the\r\ninterior of the church, the octagonal lantern appears cramped. The\r\nlacework stone spire of the crossing was one of the first in the region.\r\nFor sixty years during the XVI century two prelates of the prominent\r\nTillières family held the see; to Ambrose le Veneur is due the\r\nsuperlatively ornate Flamboyant north front of the transept, an\r\nunanswerable proof that if Gothic art was soon to end it was not of\r\ninanition it expired. To put the northern flank of his church in accord\r\nwith the façade's festival of lace stone he re-dressed the chapels along\r\nnave and choir. His nephew, Bishop Gabriel le Veneur, undertook to\r\nremake the west frontispiece in a style so neo-classic that M. Léon\r\nPalustre, the historian of the Renaissance, exclaimed, \"_Pour cette fois\r\nle moyen âge est bien fini!_\" And yet only thirty years separated the\r\nfaçades of uncle and nephew. The southwest tower has been left\r\nuncrowned; that to the northwest is an imposing heavy mass in which is\r\nthe sonorous bell of Évreux, called Gros-Pierre.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF SÉEZ[363]\r\n\r\n     Il y a plus d'une sorte de chevalerie, et les grands coups de lance\r\n     ne sont pas de rigueur. À défaut d'épée, nous avons la plume; à\r\n     défaut de plume, la parole; à défaut de parole, l'honneur de notre\r\n     vie.--LÉON GAUTIER, _La Chevalerie_.\r\n\r\n\"Prudent, modest, and gracious,\" reads the epitaph of Bishop Jean de\r\nBernières, who, having in large part built the choir of Séez Cathedral,\r\nimpressing on it his personal qualities, departed this life on Holy\r\nThursday of 1292. Séez has been called a little sister of Chartres. It\r\nis well set, but of unpretentious dimensions. Its twin spire-crowned\r\nwestern towers will be improved when the masses of masonry now propping\r\nthem are removed. The interior is white and clean, almost to prudery,\r\nwhich may be due to the renewal of choir and transept in modern times.\r\n\r\nNever from its inception have restorations ceased in this church. Not\r\nthat Séez overstepped the possibilities of Gothic equilibrium, but it\r\nmade incautious use of the calcined foundations of the Romanesque\r\ncathedral to which it succeeded. That earlier church had been erected by\r\nBishop Yves de Bellême after two cathedrals had been wiped out by the\r\nNorse invasions. Brigands had nested beside his church, and in seeking\r\nto dislodge them he had set fire to his own sanctuary, for which act he\r\nwas rebuked by Leo IX at the Council of Rheims in 1049. He took as his\r\npenance the replacing of the cathedral at his own expense, and since he\r\nwas connected with the rich Norman princes of Italy funds soon poured\r\nin. The edifice he erected was destroyed in the unceasing petty wars\r\nwaged against each other by the husbands of Aliéner of Aquitaine.\r\n\r\nThe nave of the actual cathedral, the part first undertaken, rose from\r\n1220 to 1240 under Bishop Gervais, a member of the Order of Prémontré.\r\nAfter the pause of a generation, its upper vaulting was constructed. All\r\nthe traits loved by the Norman are here; friezes below triforium and\r\nclearstory, balustrades, sharp twin lancets under equilateral arches,\r\nmultiple ridges and multiple supports, circular capitals and bases,\r\ninterior passageways contrived skillfully. Subdivision and\r\nmultiplication of parts reign supreme; merely for the pleasure it gave\r\nhis eye the Norman increased the molds of his archivolts. There are\r\ndiagonals here of so generous a profile that little vault-web shows. The\r\nNorman was partial to shadow decoration. He covered his walls with holes\r\ncut into foiled shapes which lent themselves to ever-changing contrasts\r\nof light and shade. In each spandrel of the main arcade is cut an\r\nelaborate rosette before which stands the shaft that mounts to the\r\nvault-springing. No Ile-de-France architect had thus obstructed his\r\npierced ornament.\r\n\r\nThe choir of Séez was begun soon after the nave, but about 1270 was\r\nentirely reconstructed as a Rayonnant vessel, designed audaciously to\r\nweigh as little as possible on defective foundations. The sanctuary was\r\nraised above the ambulatory, with no screen between. The capitals were\r\nslight. Here again appeared a trait of Norman redundancy--rain-guards or\r\nweather-drips over the main arches and the wall arcading; an\r\nIle-de-France master had relegated such crocketed gables where they\r\nbelong--to the exterior walls of a church.\r\n\r\nLike Évreux, Séez Cathedral possesses a uniform array of XIV-century\r\nglass. Above and below the canopied figures in the clearstory lights are\r\npanels of grisaille. The triforium was among the first to become one\r\ncomposition with the upper windows, by means of stone mullions; its\r\nquarry designs are bordered with strips of colored glass. The transept,\r\nbuilt from 1290 to 1330, has in its side walls excellent images of the\r\nprophets. Its roses are linked by mullions with the row of windows\r\nbelow; the north rose traces a star with rays. In 1373 a fire damaged\r\nthe edifice, and its reconstruction continued through the foreign wars.\r\nThe Bishop of Séez, Robert de Rouvre, proved loyal to the national cause\r\nand quitted his city for the wandering court of Charles VII, rather than\r\ntake oath to Henry V. This patriotic Norman prelate knew Jeanne d'Arc,\r\nnot at her trial at Rouen, but in her triumphal hour of the coronation\r\nat Rheims.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Séez was twice pillaged during the religious wars. The\r\nHuguenots tore the lead from the roofs, and piled the art treasures in\r\nthe aisles for bonfires. One doubly regrets the loss of the nave's\r\nwindows which would have completed the coherent scheme of color\r\ndecoration that distinguishes the church. Séez was neglected for\r\ncenturies, its decrepitude becoming such that the priests at its altars\r\nwere inconvenienced by wind and rain, and not so inconsequent, after\r\nall, then seemed the interior weather-guards. The much criticized\r\nrestoration of M. Ruprich-Robert was a necessity, even though it may\r\nhave been too radical.\r\n\r\nOf the six Norman cathedrals, that of Séez is the least known, yet it\r\nlies but a few miles beyond Falaise, visited by most travelers in\r\nNormandy. In the streets of the Conqueror's birthplace they still sing,\r\n\"_Vive le fils d'Ariette, Normans, vive le fils d'Arlette!_\" A statue of\r\nWilliam faces the Trinité in which parish he was baptized (1027). The\r\nXIII century built the Trinité's transept, the XVI century its choir\r\n(beneath which passes a street), and the Renaissance appears in a porch\r\nof faultless taste.[364] The donjon of the castle belongs to the XII\r\ncentury, though the guides will point out a window whence Duke Robert\r\nthe Magnificent first beheld the maid Arlette.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF BAYEUX[365]\r\n\r\n    Mais c'est toujours la France, ou petite ou plus grande\r\n    Le pays des beaux blés et des encadrements,\r\n    Le pays de la grappe et des ruisslements,\r\n    Le pays de genêts, de bruyère, de lande.\r\n    --CHARLES PÉGUY.\r\n\r\nIn the cathedrals of Rouen, Lisieux, and Évreux, the Norman traits are\r\nsubordinate to those of the Ile-de-France; at Séez all is Norman, and\r\naltogether Norman, too, are Bayeux and Coutances, the gems of the\r\nduchy's Gothic school. The cathedral of Bayeux stands on the site of one\r\nburned in 1046. After that fire Bishop Hugues began a Romanesque\r\ncathedral which was continued by his successor, Odo de Conteville, a\r\nhalf brother of the Conqueror. The fair Arlette, the tanner's daughter\r\nof Falaise, after the death of Duke Robert the Magnificent, was joined\r\nin lawful wedlock with a Norman baron. Her son, Odo, without the\r\nslightest vocation, was made a bishop at seventeen--precisely the feudal\r\ndebasing of the priesthood which Gregory VII was combating. At the\r\nbattle of Hastings, when he had blessed the troops, he sprang to his\r\ncharger and led the cavalry. A XII-century canon of Bayeux, Robert Wace,\r\nin his rimed history of the Norman dukes, the _Roman de Rou_, tells how,\r\nat Hastings, the Norman minstrel, Taillefer, \"famed for song, mounted on\r\na charger strong, rode on before, awhile he sang of Roland and of\r\nCharlemagne, Oliver and the vassals all, who fell in fight at\r\nRoncevals.\"\r\n\r\nAs governor of Kent, Bishop Odo deepened, by his injustices, the hate of\r\nthe dispossessed Anglo-Saxons for their new masters. On an excursion\r\nagainst Durham he so harried the countryside that it lay waste for a\r\nhundred years. When to his misgovernment was added the folly of\r\ngrandeur--for this unbalanced feudal bully intrigued to wear the papal\r\ntiara, to succeed to the great-hearted champion against iniquity,\r\nGregory VII--his brother, William, thought it best to shut him up. From\r\n1047 to 1096 Odo held the see of Bayeux. The Romanesque cathedral which\r\nhe completed was blessed in the presence of William the Conqueror and\r\nMatilda, in 1077, on which occasion the bishop presented to his church a\r\ncandelabrum such as can be seen at Hildersheim. Bayeux' crown of light\r\nhung from the high vaults until wrecked by the Calvinists in 1562.\r\n\r\nOf the cathedral built by this anomalous prelate very little remains.\r\nThe crypt is of his time, parts of the outer walls, and the body of the\r\nwest towers in their lower halls; their upper stories were re-dressed\r\nlater. The crypt was forgotten till 1412, when, in digging for a certain\r\nbishop's tomb they unearthed it. Odo's cathedral was in part destroyed\r\nin 1106 when Bayeux was besieged and burned by Henry I of England.\r\nAnother fire in 1160 made rebuilding imperative, and even before the\r\nlatter disaster Bishop Philippe d'Harcourt (1142-62) had begun a new\r\nRomanesque church. To it belonged the core of the actual\r\ntransept-crossing's piers and the lower part of the nave, which is\r\nconsidered the richest Romanesque[366] work extant. The flat wall above\r\nthe pier arcade is covered with geometric designs, interlacings, and\r\nchevrons. The curious carved disks, in the spandrels of the arches,\r\nrepresent Oriental animals and the grotesques that are to be found in\r\nCeltic illuminations. Some have thought that the exotic sculptures of\r\nBayeux derived directly from an ivory coffer, of the IV-century Hegira,\r\nbrought home by crusaders for the treasury of their cathedral. Oriental\r\nByzantium was their common origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Choir of Bayeaux Cathedral (1210-1260). Typical of\r\nNormandy's Elaborate Gothic_.]\r\n\r\nThe choir of Bayeux is a masterpiece of Norman Gothic erected by Robert\r\ndes Ablêges (1206-31), who died a crusader, and by the two successive\r\nbishops. In the nave those prelates surmounted the Romanesque lower\r\nwalls with Gothic windows and vaulting; a balustrade marks the division\r\nbetween the dissimilar parts. They reinforced the façade towers, and\r\nmade five western doorways--although the church behind possessed only\r\nthree aisles.\r\n\r\nThe student who would comprehend at a glance the difference between the\r\næsthetic equipoise of the Ile-de-France and the sumptuous Gothic of\r\nNormandy can do nothing better than to place side by side the pictures\r\nof Bayeux' choir and the curving transept end of Soissons. Those whose\r\ntaste has been formed by English minsters may prefer Bayeux, those whose\r\nloiterings have made them familiar with the cradle-land of the national\r\nart of France will find their ideal in the classic restraint of\r\nSoissons. Scarcely a square foot of Bayeux' choir is unadorned. Each\r\nspandrel is pierced by trefoils and quatrefoils, and at the apse the\r\ntriforium spandrels are entirely covered with foliage. There are acutely\r\npointed arches, and arches under arches. Mold has been added to mold,\r\nand each roll molding has its own colonnette. There are carved friezes\r\nat different levels, and the horizontal line is still further\r\naccentuated by balustrades. At the sanctuary curve double pillars stand\r\none behind the other. Even the vault web is decorated with the portraits\r\nof bishops. As the choir surmounts Odo de Conteville's crypt it is\r\nraised above the procession path. Some of its side chapels open, one on\r\nthe other, above a dividing wall, as in the Gothic choir of the\r\nAbbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen, an arrangement repeated with beautiful effect\r\nat Coutances. At the birth of the apse are turrets; there are corner\r\ntowerettes with staircases on each of the western belfries.\r\n\r\nThe Norman façade, as a rule, is very plain, lacking rose window and\r\ngalleries, and with undeveloped portals. Two marked stories usually\r\ndivide it--that of the entranceway and the big window story over it.\r\nOften the towers are disengaged awkwardly from the massive, nor is the\r\ntransition from shaft to pyramid accomplished with subtlety. Yet the\r\nNorman church has great compensations to offer. Few edifices in the\r\nclassic region of the Oise, Seine, and Marne present a more complete\r\nexterior than this chief church of Bayeux that stands so proudly over\r\nthe flat little city, unencumbered by houses, raised on a dignified\r\nplatform where the ground slopes to the east.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral's transept is Rayonnant Gothic of the XIV century, in\r\nwhich day were added the various side chapels whose tracery is\r\ngeometric. When Jeanne d'Arc had given France a new soul, Bayeux raised\r\nits lordly central tower \"to praise God in the sky.\" It was undertaken\r\nby a wealthy prelate, Louis d'Harcourt (d. 1479), of the same family as\r\nthe bishop who had built the Romanesque wall of the nave. He planted his\r\nFlamboyant octagon on the square XIII-century lantern, but the actual\r\ntop story of the transept-crossing tower is modern. Bayeux almost lost\r\nher notable beacon in the XIX century, when fissures appeared, and a\r\nzealous restorer thought to demolish it whereas all that was needed was\r\nconsolidation. The ancient Romanesque piers at the four corners of the\r\n_croisée_ were found incased in XIII-century masonry.\r\n\r\nOpposite the cathedral in the town library is an invaluable historical\r\ndocument, the Bayeux Tapestry,[367] the oldest extant large amount of\r\nthe art of design in the mediæval centuries. Many a vicissitude it has\r\nhad: lost from view till Montfaucon, the learned Benedictine of St.\r\nMaur's reform, unearthed it in 1720, and again, during the Revolution's\r\ndisorders, used as covering for ammunition carts till an enlightened\r\ncitizen redeemed it. Originally it comprised one seamless piece, just\r\nsufficient to encircle the nave of Bayeux Cathedral, for which,\r\nindubitably, it was made. Every summer solstice, on the dedication day\r\nof Odo's church, it adorned the cathedral, \"the toilet of St. John,\" it\r\nwas named, a very simple toilet, for, though called a tapestry, it is\r\nreally a drab linen band twenty inches wide, two hundred and thirty feet\r\nlong, with the design alone worked in worsted of eight colors.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is the perjury of Harold and its punishment, hence its\r\nsuitableness as an embroidery for a church. It begins with Harold and\r\nends with his death at Hastings. His oath of allegiance to William,\r\ngiven at Bayeux, is pictured. Odo is shown saving the Normans from\r\nretreat at the battle of Hastings. Some have thought he would not have\r\ndared to glorify himself till after the death of his brother, William.\r\nThe tapestry was made, probably, from 1067 to 1077, immediately\r\nfollowing the successful conquest of England, and is a contemporary,\r\ntherefore, of the _Chanson de Roland_, composed by a Norman anterior to\r\nthe First Crusade. The embroidery was done before 1085, since the\r\nConqueror's seals of that date show armor similar to that pictured in\r\nthe canvas; the sequence of the scenes indicates they are subsequent to\r\nWace's poem (c. 1160).\r\n\r\nCritics have thought, from the inscriptions, that Anglo-Saxons made the\r\ntapestry. It is known that the textile art flourished in Kent, the\r\nprovince ruled by Odo; in Normandy, too, the industry was popular. M.\r\nLevé, in the most recent monograph of this precious legacy from the\r\npast, contends that a Norman who was favorable to William the Conqueror\r\nmade it, and that the popular attribution to Queen Matilda is not\r\nunlikely. She may have had the work done as a gift for Bayeux Cathedral\r\nwhile Odo was still in royal favor. The war-like bishop died as a\r\ncrusader journeying East, and lies buried in Palermo Cathedral. The\r\npeople despised Odo, and would openly mock as he passed, \"Fie on the\r\nbishop who married adulterous King Philip to adulterous Bertrada de\r\nMontfort.\"\r\n\r\nA century after Harold's oath to Duke William, in Bayeux, and in the\r\nsame hunting-seat, at Bures, near the city, occurred a scene of passion\r\nwhose consequences were momentous. Bishop Henri de Beaumont was at work\r\non the cathedral's transept and upper nave when Henry II came to Bayeux\r\nto spend the Christmas season of 1170. For seven years western\r\nChristendom had watched his feud with the exiled primate of Canterbury.\r\nThe lesser people of France and England considered that the prelate\r\ndefended their liberties by his defense of church liberty. For how, they\r\nasked, can a churchman rebuke lay injustices if he owes his position to\r\nthe very culprits he should censure?\r\n\r\nA pretense of reconciliation between Henry and his whilom intimate had\r\nrecently been brought about. Becket felt its hollowness, since none knew\r\nbetter than he that the Angevin monarch's besetting sin was duplicity\r\nand a merciless vindictiveness when his will was successfully crossed.\r\nAs he parted with the king he had looked steadily at him, saying, with\r\nmeaning: \"I think I shall never see you again,\" and Henry Plantagenet\r\nhad cried, vehemently, \"Do you take me for a traitor?\" Soon after word\r\nwas brought to the king that Becket, newly arrived in England, was again\r\nstirring up difficulties. Henry flew into one of his madman passions\r\nhereditary in his blood from Fulk Nerra, from the Conqueror, too;\r\nfrenzied words broke from him, their purport being the upbraiding of his\r\nfollowers that he lacked a friend to rid him of this upstart priest.\r\nImmediately four of his courtiers started for England, and as December\r\nof 1170 closed, Canterbury Cathedral was the scene of a bloody\r\nassassination.\r\n\r\nBecket dead was more formidable than Becket alive. Frightened by the\r\nindignation roused by the murder, Henry conceded what the primate had\r\ncontended for. The Canterbury martyr became a frequent theme with the\r\nmediæval artist. At Coutances, Chartres, Angers, and Sens are medallion\r\nwindows that relate his story. Twice he is honored in Bayeux Cathedral,\r\nin the sculpture of the southern portal and in a window of the transept.\r\nThe popular voice of Europe canonized St. Thomas, and his grave at\r\nCanterbury became the loadstone of an international pilgrimage. The\r\nXIV-century poet has related how Merrie England rode down to Kent in the\r\nfirst spring days, when that Aprille with his shoures sweet hath pierced\r\nto the root the drought of Marche, and with the new-liveried year the\r\n_wanderlust_ awakes:\r\n\r\n    Then longen folk to goon on pilgrimages ...\r\n    And specially, from every shires ende\r\n    Of Englelond, to Caunterbury they wende,\r\n    The holy blisful martir for to seke\r\n    That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.[368]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF COUTANCES[369]\r\n\r\n     Art is the stammering of man driven from his terrestrial Paradise\r\n     but not yet arrived at the heavenly Paradise. Ever has he recalled,\r\n     ever will he recall, the lost beauty. He is fallen: beauty's\r\n     sanctuary is shut to him, but the exile traces a sketch of his\r\n     original home in the strange land where he finds himself. Does not\r\n     art fill in the intellectual life the same place that hope does in\r\n     the moral? Art is man's trial to embody his ideals, it is a\r\n     presentiment and a souvenir.--ERNEST HELLO, _Philosophie et\r\n     Athéisme_.\r\n\r\nIf the exterior aspect of Bayeux is admirable, that of Coutances\r\nCathedral is superb. The high hill of the town is its pedestal. Few\r\narchitectural views in France are finer than the silhouette of Coutances\r\nagainst the sky. And when its crowning cathedral is seen rising from a\r\nmist, it appears to ride the clouds like a mighty ship--a vision of\r\nNorman energy as memorable as the Mount of the Archangel off this very\r\ncoast, in the bay of St. Michael.\r\n\r\nAs the archives of Coutances Cathedral were destroyed by the Huguenots,\r\ndocumentary proof of its date is lacking. Midway in the XIX century even\r\nserious students contended that this Apogee Gothic edifice was the\r\nchurch dedicated in 1056 by a hero of Hastings' battle, Bishop Geoffrey\r\nde Mowbray. Like Odo of Bayeux, the sword, not the crozier, should have\r\nbeen his emblem. He was the holder of two hundred lordships. He it was\r\nwho, in Westminster Abbey, in 1066, mounting a tribune, asked the cowed\r\nAnglo-Saxons if they would consent that Duke William of Normandy assume\r\nthe title, king of England, and the next day an enormous tax was imposed\r\non the conquered race as \"joyous tribute\" to their new rulers. Geoffrey\r\ngave up residence in his Norman see to be castillan of Bristol, but,\r\ntaking part in Odo's intrigues, he was driven from the country with the\r\ncry, \"Gallows for the bishop!\"\r\n\r\nThis ambitious baron-prelate obtained donations for his Romanesque\r\ncathedral when he journeyed in southern Italy and the East, where ruled\r\nhis Norman kinsmen. When the archæologists Bouet, A. de Dion, and Abbé\r\nPigéon found parts of Geoffrey's church englobed in the present nave and\r\nfaçade of Coutances, the heated controversy over the date of the\r\ncathedral ceased. The core of each façade tower is Bishop Geoffrey's, as\r\nare some of the piers in transept and nave, and the nave's upper wall\r\n(re-dressed as Gothic about 1230). The tribune of the fighting bishop\r\nlies unused behind the present triforium, whose wall arcades plainly\r\nshow a succession of transformations.\r\n\r\nThe Romanesque cathedral was injured by fire in 1218. Bishop Bivien de\r\nChampagne planned a new church which his successor, Hugues de Morville\r\n(1208-38), started. That prelate, and his two successors, built the\r\nchoir with its double aisles of different height, and the central tower\r\ncarried on triumphal piers of multiple molds. \"What inspired idiot dared\r\nfling those stones toward the sky!\" exclaimed the great engineer,\r\nVauban, before the lantern of Coutances. The transfused gentle light\r\nthat falls from its windows tranquilizes the entire church. Even the\r\nlaie-haunted Viollet-le-Duc likened it to St. Christopher bearing the\r\nChrist Child before an image of the Virgin, in her honor. Joinville\r\nwould have called it prayer in action.\r\n\r\nThe _Deus absconditus_ impression conveyed by the mystical choir of\r\nCoutances is another of its ravishing qualities. As at Bourges and Le\r\nMans, the inner aisle is so high that it possesses its own triforium and\r\nclearstory; however, it avoided the stunted aspect of Bourges' main\r\nclearstory by omitting the triforium altogether in the central vessel.\r\nThe choir of Coutances has retained more of the warmth of atmosphere\r\nthat induces piety of soul than any other Norman cathedral, save that of\r\nRouen. Not mere brilliant talent, but genius and faith, built it. It is\r\nalmost triple-aisled, inasmuch as columns were planted in the outer\r\naisle slightly before the walls that divide the radiating chapels.\r\nThroughout the church are these lesser arrangements that charm--such,\r\nthe opening of the nave's chapels, one on the other above the dividing\r\nwalls. The ends of the transept have tribunes like many Romanesque\r\nchurches of the duchy. There are the usual Norman characteristics of a\r\ndouble-walled clearstory with different tracery in each wall, friezes of\r\nsculptured foliage, balustrades, acutely pointed arches, pierced\r\nornament, and a generous multiplication of molds, each with its own\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nTwo architects designed the church; one made the nave and the\r\nother--thought by M. Lefèvre-Pontalis to be the same Thomas Toustain who\r\nplanned the apse of Le Mans Cathedral--constructed the choir, lantern,\r\ntransept, and perhaps the spires of the western towers. Under Bishop\r\nJean d'Essay (1251-74) the cathedral was finished. Louis IX was the\r\nguest of that prelate when he came to render thanks at the national\r\nshrine of St. Michael for his safe return from Palestine.\r\n\r\nThe west façade of Coutances is very Norman: plain portals, no rose\r\nwindow, and a staircase on a corner of each belfry. The lines of the\r\ntowers rise uncrossed by horizontal bar from ground to tapering point.\r\n\"Ponder them well,\" old Villard de Honnecourt would have said before the\r\nfaithful sentinel towers of Coutances, that seem planted \"like the\r\nspear of a man-at-arms.\" This severe church front was not meant for\r\nromance like the façade of foreign-trading Rouen, or for royal pageants\r\nlike that of wine-growing Rheims. The basic forces that lead to\r\narchitectural character were different here. Northern men in an outpost\r\nof France facing the dangers of the sea, built the façade of Coutances,\r\nmen who had won this province by the sword, who with the sword were\r\nseekers for new conquests to the north, to the south. Taken with the\r\ncentral tower, the belfries of Coutances compose an unequaled group. The\r\napse exterior is equally admirable; the flying buttresses, as at Notre\r\nDame, at Paris, clear both aisles of the choir by a single hardy leap.\r\n\r\nThe adventurers of Normandy who made the brilliant, if ephemeral,\r\nkingdoms of Apulia, Sicily, and Antioch, were the sons and grandsons of\r\na Norman knight called Tancred de Hauteville,[370] whose manor lay not\r\nfar from Coutances. The people have chosen to call certain statues on\r\ntheir cathedral's northern outer wall by the names of Roger and Robert\r\nde Hauteville, and their descendants of the next generation--Bohemund,\r\nwho used the Holy Wars to push his own fortunes, and his cousin,\r\nTancred, the idealist of the First Crusade. Probably the \"Tancred\"\r\nstatues--which now are restorations--were intended by the XIII-century\r\nsculptors for Hebrew kings. In the southern kingdoms founded by the\r\nstalwart offshoots of a simple knight of Normandy, the local\r\narchitectural traits predominated, but such Norman influences appear as\r\nthe central lantern and intercrossing arches (at Monreale), acutely\r\npointed arches, and lobed rosettes cut in the spandrels (in the hospital\r\nat Palermo), west towers with corner staircases in turrets, an aisle\r\npreceding the chapels that open on the east wall of the transept (the\r\ncathedral of Cefalu, c. 1145). There are Norman traits in the cathedrals\r\nof Bari and Barletta, the latter having false tribunes like those of Eu\r\nand Rouen.[371]\r\n\r\nAt Coutances the XIV century added side chapels to the cathedral. During\r\na siege in 1356, English stone bullets damaged the church; Charles V had\r\nit restored and fortified. Bishop Silvester de Cervelle (1371-86) built\r\nthe Lady chapel, some lateral chapels, and added to the façade its only\r\nornamentation--the colonnade connecting the towers. When Jeanne d'Arc's\r\ngood name was to be vindicated, a bishop of Coutances was named by Rome\r\nas one of the three judges in the process of rehabilitation. \"Would to\r\nGod,\" exclaimed the pope, \"that I had bishops of Coutances. The Church\r\nwould be well governed.\" Olivier de Longueil, _vir gravis_, _vir bonus_,\r\n_vir mutis_ (like his own cathedral), was endowed with the ideal\r\nqualities for a judge--independence and firmness. His boyhood friends\r\nwere the Estouteville brothers, one the defender of the Mount, and the\r\nother the most active agent in the clearing of the Maid's name.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Coutances suffered much in the religious wars. So\r\ndevastated was it in 1562, when from end to end of Normandy, as at a\r\ngiven signal, priests were slaughtered at the altar, tombs violated,\r\nchurch windows broken, and images shattered, that it lay long unused.\r\nThe collapse of some vault sections made a thorough restoration\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nTo the south of Coutances, at Avranches,[372] once stood another\r\ncathedral of Normandy, begun in 1109, dedicated in 1120, and later\r\nchanged to Gothic. It was exceptional in having no transept. An\r\ninscription in the street marks the spot where, before its northern\r\nportal, Henry II of England did public penance in 1172, and received\r\nabsolution from the papal legate for his guilt in the murder of St.\r\nThomas Becket. Alas! like the cathedrals of Cambrai and Arras, the\r\nRevolution brought about the ruin of Avranches. \"_L'égalité s'était\r\nfaite dans les ruines_,\" says one of its biographers. After the sacking\r\nof 1794 the historic church collapsed. Ruskin has nobly lamented its\r\nloss: \"Did the cathedral of Avranches belong to the mob who destroyed it\r\nany more than it did to us who walk in sorrow to and fro over its\r\nfoundations?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOTHIC ART OF BRITTANY[373]\r\n\r\n     Chez les Bretons un double courant: l'esprit de liberté, l'esprit\r\n     de tradition; et pour les concilier, les pousser tous deux vers un\r\n     même but et vers un but supérieur, la flamme, la passion de\r\n     l'idéal, si ardente chez nos bardes et nos saints, si vivante, si\r\n     puissante toujours dans l'âme bretonne, et qui l'a jetée tout\r\n     entière dans la religion de l'idéal par excellence: la foi du\r\n     Christ. Liberté, tradition, idéal: voilà le triple facteur de la\r\n     vie intime et de la vie publique, de la vie nationale des\r\n     Bretons.--LÉON SÉCHÉ.\r\n\r\nBrittany was a late comer in the national art and much is it to be\r\nregretted, for had her building energies been aroused during the\r\nRomanesque epoch, her storm-worn granite rock would have then best\r\nexpressed her regional character. Among the few Romanesque works of\r\nBrittany are the crypt of Nantes Cathedral; the nave of St. Aubin's\r\nchurch within the corselet of stone at Guérande; a stalwart central\r\ntower over monastic Redon--cradle of Breton history-making, St. Gildas\r\nde Rhuys, which M. Lefèvre-Pontalis places in the first quarter of the\r\nXI century; the church of the Holy Cross, at Quimperlé, radically remade\r\nafter the fall of its tower in 1862 (the Gothic-rib masonry roof beneath\r\nthat tower dating before 1150); a Templar's church at Loctudy; the\r\nBréléverez church beside Lannion. Equally rare are Brittany's Gothic\r\nmonuments of the first part of the XIII century, Dol Cathedral being one\r\nof the few. As the era of Apogee Gothic drew to a close the cathedrals\r\nat Quimper, St. Pol-de-Léon, and Tréguier were rising. So was that rude\r\nmass of granite, the cathedral at St. Brieuc, and the churches of\r\nRosporden and Guingamp.\r\n\r\nIn the XIV century was built the Kreisker tower, parent of a generous\r\nprogeny. Sea-going people are lovers of high towers, and Brittany is\r\ndotted with them. Over the flat, bleak land of Léon the _clochers à\r\njour_ are a glory. With passion the Breton admired his landmarks. As he\r\nsailed home from long months in the northern fisheries, they were the\r\nfirst signals of welcome. To express his affection, he sometimes\r\ninscribed the Canticle of Canticles on his tower: \"Who is this that\r\ncometh up from the desert flowing with delights?\" No village felt itself\r\ntoo humble to attempt an imitation of the Kreisker at St. Pol-de-Léon.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of Breton churches belong to the Flamboyant\r\nGothic day, and at that time the most energetic builder was Finistère,\r\nthe far-western stronghold called Armorica before the Celts from Britain\r\nfled in the V and VI centuries from invading Saxons to the inviolate\r\nrefuge of these other dwellers by the sea. St. Jean-du-Doigt was built\r\nfrom 1440 to 1513, and when almost completed, Anne, duchess of Brittany\r\nand twice queen of France, visited it to pray for a cure. Her daughter,\r\nClaude, also queen of France, was equally generous to the shrine. St.\r\nJean's Pardon of the Fire, in the latter days of June, is one of the\r\nfive big Pardons of Brittany.\r\n\r\nAnne of Brittany's device, the ermine, is carved on many a façade of\r\nFrance. Both her husbands were notable art patrons. For her Charles VIII\r\nrebuilt the château at Amboise, and for her Louis XII began the château\r\nat Blois, and at Loches made an oratory that bears her name. The _Book\r\nof Hours_ of Anne of Brittany has never been surpassed. It was for her a\r\nliberal education to live in contact with her second husband's minister\r\nof state, Cardinal Georges I d'Amboise, who is said to have employed\r\npractically every Flamboyant and Renaissance architect and sculptor of\r\nthe time on his château at Gaillon, and whose tomb in Rouen Cathedral\r\nretains much of the truly French spirit of Michel Colombe's school.\r\nBrittany benefited artistically by the royal marriages of her last\r\nduchess: Anne gave the Breton Colombe the opportunity to make his\r\n_chef-d'oeuvre_--the splendid ducal tomb in Nantes Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe ermine of Anne of Brittany adorns the lintel of Folgoët, to which\r\nshe added a tower, after her visit in 1505. That stately late-Gothic\r\ncollegiate church, standing in a little Breton village above Landerneau,\r\npossesses an apostle porch--a feature popular in Brittany--a richly\r\nsculptured _jubé_ of three arcades, and altars of green Kersanton\r\ngranite. On one of its altars the corporation of masons carved compass,\r\nrule, and hammer. And in like manner, as emblems of patriotic service,\r\nmight be inscribed the names of the twelve villagers who, at personal\r\nsacrifice, when their church was to be demolished in 1808, bought it as\r\na gift for their commune. On many a shrine can modern Finistère inscribe\r\nthe names of those of her sons who fought for their country in the World\r\nWar. Just as it was given Breton sailors of the XV century to raise the\r\nsiege of Mont-Saint-Michel, so at Dixmude, in the autumn of 1914, they\r\nchecked the drive toward Calais of other invaders of French soil.\r\nBrittany, with her profound cult of the dead, will consecrate one of her\r\nnoblest Calvaries to the memory of Dixmude's heroes:\r\n\r\n    Que ces noms soient sur l'église!\r\n                      Qu'on les lise\r\n    Sur le granit des piliers ...\r\n    Que, sur la roche sévère\r\n                      D'un Calvaire,\r\n    Solitairement inscrit,\r\n    A travers la pastorale\r\n                      Vespérale\r\n    Le nom du mort pousse un cri![374]\r\n\r\nOther Flamboyant Gothic monuments of the ancient duchy are the choir of\r\nthe cathedral of St. Pol-de-Léon; the cloister, porch, and central tower\r\nof Tréguier Cathedral; the chapel of Notre Dame-des-Portes at\r\nChâteauneuf-du-Faou; Notre Dame in the little city of Vitré, that claims\r\nto be, with Avignon, the most entirely mediæval walled town in France;\r\nSt. Jean and Notre Dame at Lamballe, which latter XIII-century church,\r\nwith foundations hewn out of the solid rock, was rebuilt and fitted with\r\nXVI-century windows; St. Mélaine, at Morlaix, rebuilt, 1482, and\r\npossessing a towering baptismal font of carved wood; and Notre Dame at\r\nKernascleden, between Le Faouët and Guéméné, the work of two brothers\r\nnamed Bail.\r\n\r\nThe making of stained glass flourished in the later Middle Ages at\r\nQuimper, Tréguier, and Vannes. Good windows are to be found at Dol,\r\nQuimper, Guérande, Ploërmel (where the church has a rich Flamboyant\r\nfaçade pignon), at Kergoat, Moncontour, Les Iff (where the donors were\r\nthe Laval-Montmorency family), at Plélan, Plogonnec, and at Penmarc'h,\r\nwhose Pardon of the Rosary occurs on the first Sunday of October.\r\nBecause the popular gatherings called pardons are among the basic forces\r\nthat have helped to mold the architecture of the ancient duchy, they are\r\nimportant for the student of the builder's art.\r\n\r\nThe late-Gothic churches that cover Brittany are rich in ecclesiastical\r\nfurniture, carved baptismal temples, and panels sculptured with the\r\nquaint usages of burial and marriage, or with agricultural scenes, such\r\nas those at St. Goueznon (1615), at Bannalec (1605), at La Roche-Maurice\r\nnear Brest, and at Notre Dame-la-Grâce, near Guingamp, the latter two\r\nchurches possessing some \"storied windows richly dight.\" At Kerdévot is\r\na wooden reredos, at Roscoff a very beautiful alabaster one of the XV\r\ncentury; at Lambadec a _jubé_ dated 1480; at St. Fiacre-du-Faouët (whose\r\npardon comes on the first Sunday of July) a rood-loft of richly carved\r\nwood, unfortunately painted in crude colors; at Quimperlé, in the church\r\nof Ste. Croix, that is fashioned in memory of the sepulcher shrine at\r\nJerusalem, is a _jubé_ almost wholly of the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nBecause of her pardons, Brittany's religious ceremonies took place\r\nlargely in the open air, even as each of her tribes, each _plou_, in\r\nprehistoric times had gathered around her solemn menhirs and dolmens.\r\nHence the Breton made much of churchyards, placing in them his\r\nCalvaries, profound expressions of a people's emotions carved\r\nprimitively in the regional coarse granite. The Lord's Passion had\r\nvivified the Celtic soul ever since Christianity took possession of it.\r\nAs granite is unyielding to sculpture, many a Breton turned to wood to\r\nexpress his verve, carving his church beams like the prow ends of ships.\r\n\r\nMorlaix[375] is a good center from which to visit many of the notable\r\nrevered places. Close by, in the village of Plougonven, is the oldest\r\nCalvary extant (1554). A few miles away is that of St. Thégonnec (1610),\r\na shrine invoked for the cure of beasts, where beneath a statue of Our\r\nLady is inscribed: \"We beg you, _Madame Vièrge_, to accept our first\r\nbull.\" Near the church is one of the isolated chapels called ossuaries\r\nin which were gathered the bones of the past generations when they had\r\nhad their turn in the churchyard's consecrated ground. The chapel bears\r\nan inscription from Maccabees: \"It is therefore a holy and wholesome\r\nthought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from their sins.\"\r\nBedrock in the Breton is his instinct to join his progenitors and his\r\ndescendants in a permanence of spiritual emotion.[376] No other people\r\nof the earth risk life more freely than these frequenters of the\r\ndeep-sea fisheries; nowhere is the cult of the dead more tenacious,\r\nbecause it is considered that they who have fallen asleep with Godliness\r\nhave great grace laid up for them.\r\n\r\nNear St. Thégonnec, at Guimiliau, is another Calvary (1581), and another\r\nossuary and triumphal arch. The capacious church porch is lined with\r\nstatues of the apostles. At Carhaix, Pleyben (1650), Cronan, and\r\nPenmarc'h, are Calvaries, and that at Lampaul is united in the same\r\ncomposition with the graveyard's triumphal arch. Brittany's most\r\nimposing _Calvaire_, and the most wonderful wayside shrine ever made,\r\ncomprising over two hundred images in all, is at Plougastel-Daoulas, a\r\nmemorial of the epidemic of 1598. The greenish Kersanton granite of\r\nwhich it is made is quarried close by in the harbor of Brest, and\r\nacquires with time the endurance and appearance of bronze. Breton\r\npeasants are represented playing on Breton pipes in the\r\nEntry-into-Jerusalem scene. Late comers these rough-hewn sculptures may\r\nbe in the national art, but in so far as character goes they might\r\neasily belong to the XII or XIII century.\r\n\r\nThe theorist may say that the racial exclusiveness of Brittany is one\r\nof the reasons why it has not excelled in architecture and the kindred\r\narts. That may be so. The chief concern of the Celt has ever been to\r\nsave his soul. The architectural purist is prone to carp at Breton\r\nGothic, and some even dare say that the Kreisker itself errs, in that\r\nits shaft is not sufficiently welded with its spire. Without a doubt the\r\nabsence of symmetry in many churches of the ancient province is at first\r\ndisturbing, but soon one comprehends that one travels in Brittany not\r\nfor its architecture, but for the unconquerable soul of a people who,\r\nwhile devoted to tradition, have ever stood up uncowed, unswerving in\r\ntheir antagonism to despotism. The sensitive traveler--that is, the man\r\nwith kindly, plain loyalties--will let himself grow attached to the\r\nmediocre, irregular churches of this individual land.\r\n\r\nSome of those irregularities are startling enough. The pilgrimage church\r\nof Guingamp has a curious two-storied triforium, and flying buttresses\r\ninside the choir over the aisles. Its nave is an amalgam, one wall\r\nGothic and its vis-à-vis a fluted-pilastered Renaissance affair. The\r\nsculptor gave his initiative full scope in the apostle's porch--a\r\nrevered spot on the days of Guingamp's famous pardon, that precedes the\r\nfirst Sunday of July. At Dinan, in the church of St. Sauveur--in whose\r\ntransept is treasured the heart of Duguesclin, born not far away--a\r\nRomanesque wall faces a Flamboyant Gothic one. In the corsair stronghold\r\nof St. Malo,[377] breeder of strong men, the cathedral's walls make no\r\npretense to be parallel.\r\n\r\nThe Breton has been too engrossed in keeping warm in his churches the\r\nspirit of devotion to bother about such details as symmetry. Eagerly he\r\nadded chapel to chapel, aisle to aisle, regardless how difficult it\r\nmight be for a stranger to orient himself on entering. The wise traveler\r\nwill accept Brittany as she is, for if he does not, Brittany, like\r\nSpain, will exasperate him by her tranquil indifference to his\r\ncriticisms. On a mediæval tower of the castle at St. Malo was inscribed:\r\n\r\n    Grumble who will.\r\n    So shall it be\r\n    As pleases me.[378]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL AT DOL-EN-BRETAGNE[379]\r\n\r\n    Bretagne, ô mon pays, garde ta foi naïve,\r\n    Car Dieu se plaît surtout dans la simplicité;\r\n    C'est comme le miroir d'une source d'eau vive,\r\n    Où vient se réfléchir, l'astre de vérité.\r\n    --JOSEPH ROUSSE, _Poésies bretonnes_.\r\n\r\nBrittany may be a land of shrines more than of churches; nevertheless,\r\nsome five of its former nine bishoprics are of interest in the Gothic\r\nstory--Dol, Nantes, Quimper, St. Pol-de-Léon, and Tréguier.\r\n\r\nThe hardy outpost of Dol, in the north, has stood many a siege, fought\r\nmany a battle, and its church walls are crenelated where they face the\r\ncity ramparts. The tutelary of the _ci-devant_ cathedral is St. Samson,\r\nwhose name keeps alive the memory of the arrival of the harassed Celts\r\nof Britain who poured \"like a torrent\" into Armorica during the dark\r\ncenturies of the Middle Ages when the migrations of the Barbarians had\r\nwiped out Rome's civilization in England. In Dol's great eastern window,\r\nSt. Samson and some monk companions are shown crossing the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of Dol--which Stendhal admired beyond others in France--is\r\na melancholy severe granite edifice, though probably the best Gothic of\r\nthe province. Characteristics both of Normandy and the Ile-de-France\r\nappear in it. Two of the wholly detached colonnettes of each pier are\r\nnow clamped with metal bands, and the wide arches of the triforium would\r\nbe better suited to open on a gallery than as they are at present--set\r\nclose to a blank wall; a few doors in the wall give on the lean-to roof\r\nover the aisles. The structure of the church demonstrates that, as the\r\nworks rose, extra supports were added for stability.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral was begun by its nave soon after a conflagration of the\r\ntown, in 1203, caused by the troops of John Lackland. Vestiges only of\r\nthe wrecked church were retained. The façade's southern tower is late\r\nwork, despite its Romanesque character, and its fellow belfry to the\r\nnorth is in larger part of the XVI century. Out of the nave's southern\r\nflank opens a graceful XIII-century porch. The choir, which ends in a\r\nflat eastern wall, was finished by 1265, when was installed its splendid\r\nbig window of eight medallion panels that set forth the Last Judgment.\r\nIn the XIV century was opened the arch leading to the Lady chapel of\r\nthat same date, wherein were used various supplementary ribs, around\r\nwindows and in corners, to obviate the difficulty of vaulting a\r\nsquare-ended edifice. To the XIV century, too, belong the side chapels\r\nof the choir, and the big porch of St. Magloire before the transept's\r\nsouthern door.\r\n\r\nAgainst the blank wall that closes the north arm of the transept stands\r\nthe much-discussed Renaissance tomb of Bishop Thomas James. It is an\r\ninitial work of the Juste brothers of Tours, the ablest among the\r\nItalians who brought the new art standards across the Alps. The bishop's\r\nrecumbent image has disappeared. From 1482 to 1504 he held the see of\r\nDol, though only in residence after 1486, as he lived in Rome, the papal\r\nguardian of the castle of St. Angelo. In his testament he requested a\r\nsimple burial, but his nephews--whose profiles adorn the tomb--chose to\r\nerect this elaborate monument, whose cream-colored fine-grained stone,\r\ndelicately arabesqued, contrasts happily with the dark granite walls.\r\nOne of the nephews had known the Juste, or Betti brothers, in Florence,\r\nand through him those artists came to France. In his prime Jean Juste\r\nmade the tomb of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany for the Royal Abbey at\r\nSt. Denis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL AT NANTES[380]\r\n\r\n    Très crestien, franc royaume de France,\r\n    Dieu a les braz ouvers pour t'acoler,\r\n    Prest d'oublier ta vie pécheresse:\r\n    Requier pardon, bien te vendra aidier\r\n    Nostre Dame, la très puissante princesse,\r\n    Qui est ton cry et que tiens pour maistresse.\r\n    Les saints aussy te viendront secourir,\r\n    Desquelz les corps font en toy demourance.\r\n    Ne vueilles plus en ton péchié dormir\r\n    Très crestien, franc royaume de France!\r\n     --CHARLES D'ORLÉANS (1391-1465).\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. Peter, at Nantes, the third on the site, is a\r\nlate-Gothic structure, not overvirile, somewhat artificial, but\r\ningenious and elegant, even as is the contemporary verse of Charles\r\nd'Orléans, who was taken prisoner at Agincourt and passed half a\r\nlifetime in exile. M. Gaston Paris has drawn attention to the similarity\r\nbetween XV-century architecture and XV-century poetry. Is not that bijou\r\nof artistry, the chapel of St. Hubert, which Anne of Brittany's first\r\nhusband set on the cliff edge at Amboise, of the same quality as a\r\nrondel of the poet-duke's? Is not Villon's ironic, tragically-true note\r\nreflected in the Dance of Death painted on church walls during those\r\nyears of pest and internecine strife? Brittany has retained one of the\r\nonly two surviving _danses macabres_, in the hamlet of Kermaria,[381]\r\nthe house of Mary, that lies between the villages of Plehedel and\r\nPlouha. In Auvergne, at La Chaise Dieu, is the other.\r\n\r\nIn 1431 Jean V, of the third ducal line of Brittany, the de Montforts,\r\ndecided to remake the cathedral of the outpost city wherein stood his\r\ncastle. Nantes never was _Bretagne bretonnante_, being differentiated\r\nfrom Finistère amid its rocky seacoast, by its position on the Loire of\r\ncommerce and art. That wonderful river, in an eight-hundred-mile course\r\nfrom Languedoc to Brittany, passes some of the fairest monuments of\r\nFrance: Le Puy, Nevers, La Charité, St. Satur, St. Benoît, Orléans,\r\nBlois, Chaumont, Amboise, Tours, Langeais--where Anne of Brittany wedded\r\nCharles VIII--Saumur, St. Florent, Gennes, Cunault, and the castle and\r\ncathedral of Nantes.\r\n\r\nUnder ducal patronage the nave of Nantes Cathedral rose apace; the\r\ncapitals of its north side have deeply undercut curly-tipped foliage,\r\nbut on the nave's south side the piers lack capitals altogether. The\r\ninterior of the church is of glacial aspect; light floods it pitilessly.\r\nIts eastern end is modern. In 1886 was unearthed a Romanesque crypt\r\nwhich Abélard must have known, for he was born in a manor close by\r\nNantes, and returned to live here in 1136.\r\n\r\nGuillaume Dammartin, of the notable family of Flamboyant Gothic\r\narchitects, is mentioned as working on Nantes Cathedral, and M. Arthur\r\nde la Borderic, Brittany's historian, has discovered that an artist of\r\nTours, Mathelin Rodier, was master-of-works when the western portals\r\nwere sculptured (1470-80), and while the stately inner-court façade of\r\nthe duke's château was rising. In that castle Anne of Brittany was born\r\nin 1477, became a reigning duchess at twelve years of age, and in its\r\nchapel was married, in 1499, to Louis XII. On her deathbed she willed\r\nher heart to her native city. She completed the castle of Nantes by what\r\nis called the Horseshoe Tower overlooking the river.\r\n\r\nAnne must have known the master, Mathelin Rodier, who made the portals\r\nof the cathedral, decorating them with the same undercut leaf foliation,\r\nthe same lavish splayed ornaments as adorn the contemporary western\r\ndoors of Tours Cathedral, a hundred and thirty miles to the east. The\r\nlarger statues at Nantes' entrances have been destroyed, but in the\r\nvoussures are many small groups, sometimes with four or five personages\r\nin a scene, chiseled with natural attitudes and expressive faces. One of\r\nthe portals commemorates St. Peter (observe the _Quo Vadis_ episode),\r\nanother, St. Paul, while the place of honor is given to the Saviour.\r\nWithin the church, under the organ, are XV-century statues, one of which\r\nrepresents the duke patron who began the cathedral, the grandfather of\r\nAnne of Brittany.\r\n\r\nThrough the filial piety of Anne, her birthplace possesses the _canto\r\ncygni_ of Gothic sculpture, \"the most unscathed monument of the Middle\r\nAges,\" intact because it was taken apart and buried during the\r\nRevolution. The tomb of Anne's parents, Francis II, the last duke of\r\nBrittany, and his duchess, is the work of a Breton, for an authentic\r\nmanuscript has proved that Michel Colombe was born in Finistère, within\r\nsight of the Kreisker. His genius was fortified by long years passed in\r\nthe art atmosphere of Tours, and strengthened, too, by the Flemish\r\nrealism which had come into France by way of the Dijon school that led\r\nthe first half of the XV century, even as the school of Tours, whose\r\nchief master was Colombe, led its latter half. Nor did this Breton,\r\nfecundated by Touraine and sturdy Burgundy, ignore the incoming Italian\r\nculture, as is shown by his preference for ideal beauty over absolute\r\nrealism: Celt, Teuton, and Latin--all were needed for the making of the\r\nlast of the great Gothic masters, one who held loyally to the spiritual\r\nessence of the Middle Ages in a day when Renaissance pomp was fast\r\nrising to supremacy.\r\n\r\nMichel Colombe was seventy years of age when Anne of Brittany, on a\r\nvisit to Tours shortly after her second marriage, commissioned him to\r\nmake a mausoleum for her parents, for which she had imported white\r\nmarble from Genoa, and black from Liège. From 1502 to 1507 Colombe\r\nworked on the larger images, in his studio at Tours. His are the\r\nrecumbent figures of the duke and duchess, and the entrancing little\r\nangels who support their headcushion, ministering with the same loving\r\nwillingness as the XII-century angels of Senlis' lintel. From Colombe's\r\nmaster hand are the four allegorical figures at the corners of the tomb,\r\nrobust and graceful women, of the local type to be seen in central\r\nFrance to-day. They typify qualities of the defunct, Fortitude,\r\nTemperance, Prudence, and Justice--this last image said to be a study\r\nfrom Duchess Anne herself.\r\n\r\nCenturies later a similar arrangement of symbolic figures was used by\r\nPaul Dubois for his noble tomb of General de Lamoricière (a son of\r\nNantes), which balances, in the north arm of the transept, the ducal\r\ntomb to the south. Valor, Faith, Charity, and History, are the four\r\ncorner statues that commemorate the pioneer of civilization in French\r\nAfrica, who was so loved by the natives that he went freely among them\r\nunarmed, a modern hero who proved himself a true Breton by assuming the\r\nleadership of a lost cause.\r\n\r\nLesser masters of the school of Tours worked on the noted ducal tomb of\r\nNantes; Guillaume Regnault made the small images and Jerome of Fiesole\r\nthe arabesques, the same two masters who composed the tomb of the\r\nchildren of Anne of Brittany and Charles VIII, now in the cathedral at\r\nTours. And when Michel Colombe had finished his statues, Anne had the\r\nLyons master, Jean Perréal, one of the most active agents in\r\npopularizing in France the new art standards of Italy, visit Nantes to\r\nsupervise the erection of the mausoleum whose ordinance he had designed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF QUIMPER[382]\r\n\r\n    Ce qui me charme en toi, Quimper de Cornouailles,\r\n    C'est ton coeur paysan sous tes airs de cité.\r\n    --ANATOLE LE BRAZ.\r\n\r\nLike the chief church at St. Pol-de-Léon, and that of Tréguier, St.\r\nCorentin at Quimper is \"widowed of its bishop.\" Admirably situated, it\r\nstands with all the dignity of a cathedral above the pleasant little\r\n\"river city of gables and fables,\" which etches itself on the memory. It\r\nis a well-cared-for shrine, full of warm Breton piety, seen at its\r\nrichest during the pardon gatherings of August 15th.\r\n\r\nBishop Rainaud laid the first stone of Quimper Cathedral in 1239. Its\r\nambulatory copied a disposition first used in Soissons Cathedral, but\r\nrepeated only here and at Bayonne, though across the Rhine it became\r\npopular. The vault ribs of each chapel meet in the same keystone as the\r\nribs of that section of the procession path on which the chapel opens.\r\nAbout 1280 a little shrine, which had stood in the rear of the\r\ncathedral, separated from it by a lane, was joined to the ambulatory of\r\nthe new Gothic choir by means of a canted bay. This improvised Lady\r\nchapel increased the irregular alignment of the church. The deviation of\r\nQuimper's axis is extraordinary. Standing in its central aisle, at the\r\nrear of the nave, you cannot see the first of the three bays that\r\nusually are apparent at the apse curve, and such is the bend of the\r\nchoir that its southern aisle possesses one more bay than does the aisle\r\nto the north. When the time came to replace the Romanesque nave by the\r\nactual one, that new Gothic edifice might have straightened somewhat the\r\naxial line by following the false orientation of the choir. But\r\napparently the proximity of the episcopal quarters prevented this being\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nThe choir of St. Corentin retains the canopy-image windows of Jamin\r\nSohier (1417), and the nave, those of the Jamin Sohier of a second\r\ngeneration; a western window is dated 1496. The shield and helmet of one\r\nof Brittany's dukes of the Montfort line, Anne's immediate forebear,\r\nadorn the gable of the main façade. The cathedral works ceased during\r\nthe first part of the Hundred Years' War; the choir was not roofed in\r\nstone till the first quarter of the XV century. In 1424 the nave was\r\nbegun and the foundations of the west towers laid. Quimper's towers\r\nderive directly from the famous one of St. Pierre at Caen. There are the\r\nsame deep, elongated twin-window recesses serving as buttresses. After\r\nanother period of inactivity, the cathedral's nave was vaulted. In the\r\nlatter part of the XIX century the west towers received their crowning\r\nof crocketed spires, paid for by a popular collection called \"the penny\r\nof St. Corentin.\"\r\n\r\nHow these dwellers by the sea love their obsolete local saints! How\r\ncertain they are that to forget them is to lose infinitely precious\r\nlinks with the past. The solidarity of ancestors with descendants is no\r\ndead letter in Finistère, that lives not by bread alone. One knows that\r\nthe white-coiffed women of Quimper--and their daily gathering in their\r\nmediæval church makes a brave showing--would not love this shrine of St.\r\nCorentin so well had it a name common to western Christendom. But St.\r\nCorentin, St. Tugdual, St. Huec, St. Iltud, St. Budoc, St. Jacut, St.\r\nJubel, St. Gulstan, St. Comery--ah, those are the potent ones before the\r\nheavenly throne when a true Breton needs assistance!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF ST. POL-DE-LÉON[383]\r\n\r\n    O Dieu qui nous créas ou guerriers ou poètes,\r\n    Sur la côte marins, et pâtres dans les champs,\r\n    Sous les vils intérêts ne courbe pas nos têtes;\r\n    Ne fais pas des Bretons un peuple de marchands.\r\n    J'ai vu, par l'avarice ennuyés et vieillis,\r\n    Des barbares sans foi, sans coeur, sans espérance,\r\n    Et, l'amour m'inspirait, j'ai chanté mon pays.\r\n    --A. BRIZEUX, _L'élégie de la Bretagne_.\r\n\r\nThe most complete Gothic monument of Brittany is the whilom cathedral of\r\nSt. Pol-de-Léon, one of the few important churches of the Middle Ages to\r\nbe entirely carried out, with spired towers, and porches for the\r\ndifferent needs of soul and body, one for catechumens, another for\r\nlepers. Its choir and nave differ strikingly in color and quality of\r\nstone. The nave of yellow sandstone was built first, and is decidedly\r\nthe most artistic portion of the edifice. The florid Gothic choir is of\r\ngray granite.\r\n\r\nAs the XIII century closed the nave was begun, continuing building up to\r\nthe dire times of the Hundred Years' War. It has the Norman traits of\r\nsculptured bands of academic design below triforium and clearstory,\r\ntrefoils cut in the spandrels of arches, multiple arch molds, each with\r\nits own support, and a circulation passage beneath the upper windows.\r\nThe triforium was begun elaborately, with much foliate decoration, but\r\neconomy soon forced the architect to adopt a simpler plan. The nave's\r\nsouth aisle is double beyond the fourth bay where a porch opens, and the\r\nstones show that the outer aisle was originally a separate chamber,\r\nconverted during the XV century into a passageway.\r\n\r\nThe Flamboyant Gothic choir, that lacks the harmony and elegance of the\r\nnave, was built from 1439 to 1472. Chapel has been added to chapel,\r\naisle to aisle, with the profusion loved by the Breton, who would press\r\ninto God's service every foot of free land around his presbytery. The\r\ntransept of the XII and XIII centuries was radically reconstructed\r\nduring the late-Gothic day, retaining vestiges only of its Romanesque\r\nand early-Gothic work. It is doubtless to such repeated modelings that\r\nsome of the buttresses fail to correspond to columns and vault shafts.\r\n\r\nDuring a siege of St. Pol-de-Léon by the English, the church called the\r\nKreisker, \"center of the city,\" was injured. When rebuilt, from 1345 to\r\n1399, there was erected, between its nave and choir, carried merely on\r\nopen arches, a grandiose tower modeled on Caen's belfry of St. Pierre,\r\nas had been the twin towers of St. Pol's cathedral, lesser in height\r\nthan \"the Kreisker.\" The deeply recessed lancet openings in each face of\r\nthe giant beacon serve the practical purpose of buttresses. Few cities\r\ncan show three such brave towers as this little Breton town. \"The\r\nKreisker,\" mantled in golden lichen, is the pride of every Breton. So\r\nsure is its poise, so supple and strong, that for centuries all the wild\r\nstorms of the ocean have swept unheeded through its open stonework\r\nspire. The popular songs love to extol it:\r\n\r\n    Je suis natif du Finistère,\r\n    A Saint-Pol j'ai reçu le jour,\r\n    Mon clocher est l'plus beau d'la terre,\r\n    Mon pays l'plus beau d'alentour;\r\n    Rendez-moi ma bruyère et mon clocher à jour!\r\n\r\nSt. Pol received its name from another exile of Britain, and the good\r\nman's little bell is rung on the days of Pardon, over the heads of the\r\npeople, who believe it can cure maladies of the mind. The Revolution\r\ntried to change the town's name to Port Pol, but the traditionalists and\r\nthe independents that are the Bretons soon reverted to their St.\r\nPol-de-Léon.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL OF TRÉGUIER[384]\r\n\r\n     Une, deux génerations peuvent oublier la Loi, se rendre coupable de\r\n     tous les abandons, de toutes les ingratitudes. Mais il faut bien, à\r\n     l'heure marquée que la chaine soit reprise et que la petite lampe\r\n     vacillante brille de nouveau dans la maison.\r\n\r\n     --ERNEST PSICHARI (1883-1914).\r\n\r\nThe cathedral of St. Tugdual obtained its name from the founder of a\r\nlocal monastery, a nephew of St. Brieux, who had crossed from Britain\r\nwith the returning missionary, St. Germain of Auxerre, and in Armorica\r\nhad established a religious house which eventually gave its name to a\r\nBreton city. No church of the region demonstrates more clearly how\r\ndifficult it is to obtain full Gothic effect with granite. Lacking\r\nsculpture, the art is necessarily abortive.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Tréguier is dark and forbidding. The capitals of the\r\ngraceless octagonal piers are merely uncut bands. There are Norman\r\nbalustrades and a Norman interior passage below the clearstory lights.\r\nThe name of the architect, Goneder, was recently unearthed by M. de la\r\nBorderie. From the previous Romanesque cathedral was retained the Tour\r\nHastings which now terminates the northern arm of the transept. Toward\r\nthe western end of the church the molds of the archivolts die off in the\r\npiers.\r\n\r\nThe nave rose from 1296 to 1333; then came the pause of the Hundred\r\nYears' War. Building was resumed--always on the original Rayonnant\r\nlines--by Bishop Jean de Coëtquis (1450-61), whose relative, of the same\r\nname, was finishing the nave of Tours Cathedral. The charming Flamboyant\r\ncloisters of Tréguier were made from 1461 to 1468, and with the Tour\r\nHastings they compose one of the oft-sketched architectural groups of\r\nthe country. St. Tugdual has suffered by wars and revolutions, being\r\ndamaged by the English in 1347, by the Spaniards in 1592, the Liguers in\r\n1594, and the Revolution's cyclone passing here as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the nave of Tréguier Cathedral stands a sumptuous Gothic monument to\r\nhonor Brittany's patron saint, Yves de Helori, born in 1253, a mile from\r\nthe town in the manor of Kernartin--modern Minihy. On the nineteenth of\r\nevery May Tréguier marches in procession to Minihy to commemorate the\r\ngood man who cleared the region of evil-doers, built a hospital beside\r\nhis home that he might himself wait on the stricken, rose at midnight to\r\nchant matins, preached sometimes five sermons a day, and was the poor\r\nman's lawyer, so a popular hymn relates: \"An advocate and not a thief, a\r\nthing almost beyond belief.\" The pardon of St. Yves, the Pardon of the\r\nPoor, is one of the five chief ones of Brittany. For centuries those who\r\nhad pending law cases repaired to his primitive tomb. Thus Henry VII,\r\nTudor, crossed from England the year before he won his kingship, to\r\npetition the favor of the Breton saint who had supported only just\r\ncauses in law. Universities selected him as their patron.\r\n\r\nSt. Yves was the son of a knight who went crusading with St. Louis. When\r\nsent, at fourteen, to Paris University, he sat with other young scholars\r\non the rush-strewn floors to listen to the scholastics; even in his\r\nstudent days he visited the sick poor in the hospitals. Before thirty he\r\nentered the episcopal magistry, and henceforth his abilities were\r\ndevoted to the relief of orphans and widows. This good man, after whom\r\nmyriads of the sons of Brittany have been named, worked assiduously, it\r\nis said, to collect funds for the building of the Gothic cathedral of\r\nTréguier.\r\n\r\nIn a street near the cloisters of St. Tugdual, Ernest Renan was born in\r\n1828, his name deriving from an Irish anchorite of VI-century Armorica.\r\nFrom his Breton father he derived his gravity, respect, faith, and\r\nimagination; from his mother's Gascon stock his irony, gayety, and\r\nserenity in skepticism, the result being, as he himself said, a tissue\r\nof contradictions. Brittany took his _Vie de Jésus_ as a personal\r\naffront. That a son of hers, once destined for the priesthood, should\r\ncall her dear Christ of Calvary a \"sorcerer,\" a \"demi-impostor,\" a\r\n\"_géant sombre_,\" \"_un fin et joyeux moralist_,\" pierced her to the\r\nsoul. When, beside the cathedral of Tréguier, partisan politics raised a\r\nRenan statue (singularly inartistic), whose inscription was taken as an\r\naffront by every believing Christian, two million Bretons donated toward\r\nthe erection of a monumental protest. The Calvary of Reparation stands\r\nat the entrance to Tréguier, voicing the cry attributed to the dying\r\nJulian the Apostate, \"Thou hast conquered, Galilæan!\"\r\n\r\nThe son of Renan's daughter was that chosen soul, Ernest Psichari, who\r\nfell defending Belgium in August, 1914, a death considered by mystic\r\nBrittany to be an atonement. He has told of his spiritual anguish,\r\n\"without defense against evil, without protection against sophistry,\r\nwandering without conviction in the poisoned gardens of vice, sick to\r\nthe soul and ever pursued by obscure remorse, weighed down by the bitter\r\nderision of a life ruled by disordered sentiments and thoughts.\" In his\r\n_Appel des Armes_ and his _Voyage du Centurion_ he has traced his\r\npilgrimage from materialism to Christian belief, taking \"_contre son\r\npère le parti de ses pères_.\" His grandfather, of Tréguier, in Armorica,\r\nhad written many years earlier: \"The characteristic trait of the Breton\r\nrace is idealism--the disinterested pursuit of a moral or intellectual\r\naim. The Celt craves the Infinite. He thirsts for it, seeking it beyond\r\nall the prizes of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMING UP\r\n\r\n     All our France is in our cathedrals.... Initiation into the beauty\r\n     of Gothic is initiation into the truth of our race, of our sky, of\r\n     our landscape.... Gothic art is the sensible, tangible soul of\r\n     France; it is the religion of the French atmosphere. We are not\r\n     incredulous; we are merely unfaithful. We have lost at the same\r\n     time the sense of our race and of our religion. To regain force we\r\n     must live again in the past, revert to first principles. Taste\r\n     reigned of yore in our country: we must become French again.\r\n\r\n     --RODIN, _Les cathédrales de France_.\r\n\r\nWith many a gap, with many a lapse, we have followed the earlier stages\r\nof Gothic art in the land where it was born. We have seen how, from the\r\nefforts of the monks to cover their Romanesque naves with a permanent\r\nstone roof, was evolved the intersecting rib vault which was the basis\r\nof Gothic architecture, how for a short time churches used the\r\nRomanesque and Gothic systems simultaneously as in Morienval and Poissy,\r\nand for another short period the churches were Gothic in essentials\r\nwhile retaining a few traits of the earlier phase. By many the\r\nimperishable hour that produced Soissons' transept, the choir of St.\r\nRemi, Notre Dame at Laon, and Notre Dame at Paris, is beyond all others.\r\nWhen the national art expanded into its full flowering in the XIII\r\ncentury--an era as great in men and the making of history as in\r\nart--Gothic science, though ever seeking, ever reaching out, remained\r\ndisciplined, even as the scholastic builders themselves were\r\ndisciplined.\r\n\r\nWhile eighty cathedrals in France were rising, and in the same hour some\r\nhundreds of lesser churches, the rulers of the nation were capable\r\nwarriors, compilers of laws, and administrators, the builders were\r\nmonarchs, crusading bishops, troubadour counts, cloistral ascetics, and\r\narduous sinners. Serf, artisan, burgher, baron, and king built the\r\ncathedrals; field laborer, minstrel, maiden, and chatelaine were\r\nharnessed to the same cart to drag in the great stones. Little children\r\ncleared the church pavement of sand and cement in preparation for the\r\n\"Day of Benediction\" for their city, as the solemn blessing of their\r\nchurch was held to be by those God-fearing generations.\r\n\r\nThe new school of mediæval archæology, that during three generations has\r\nbeen interpreting the Gothic churches of France, is teaching us to read\r\nthe stones with sympathy. \"Symbol of Faith, the cathedral was also a\r\nsymbol of Love,\" says M. Émile Mâle. \"All men labored there. The\r\npeasants offered their all, the work of their strong arms. They pulled\r\ncarts and carried stones on their shoulders with the brave good will of\r\nthe giant-saint, Christopher. The burgess gave his money, the baron his\r\nland, the artist his genius. During more than two centuries every vital\r\nforce in France collaborated on the cathedrals. From that comes the\r\npuissant life emanating from these eternal monuments. The dead, too,\r\nwere associated with the living, for the cathedral was paved with\r\ntombstones, and the earlier generations, with hands joined in prayer,\r\ncontinued to worship in their ancient church. Past and present were\r\nunited in the same feeling of love. The cathedral was the very\r\nconscience, the very soul of the city.\"[385]\r\n\r\nAfter five generations had reared so many and such magnificent churches,\r\ntheir energy, because it was human, passed from plenitude into decline.\r\nThe death of St. Louis, in 1270, may be taken as the beginning of the\r\nchange, though even before had been used various cut-and-dried Rayonnant\r\nfeatures. Genius flagged when structural perfection was achieved. The\r\ndivinely restless reaching out of art was stultified by geometric rule.\r\nGraceful and stately as is many a XIV-century church, never in them do\r\nwe find the unexpected entrancing touches of Apogee Gothic. Gothic was\r\nfast becoming an art made tongue-tied by authority.\r\n\r\nAs time went on profiles deteriorated, sharp prismatic molds succeeding\r\nto the virile torus, or molds fluid and vague. By the XV century\r\ncapitals were omitted altogether. The sane marking of the horizontal\r\nline had become an offense to the eye. Without capitals the molds died\r\naway weakly in the piers. Flamboyant Gothic architecture exhibited all\r\nthese traits, and, moreover, gave capricious rein to many a redundant\r\ndetail, yet it was none the less a phase of art far more vigorous and\r\nsatisfactory than the Rayonnant geometric period, its predecessor. The\r\nverve and abundance of Flamboyant Gothic was a rebirth. The inspiration\r\nof St. Jeanne d'Arc, the restored political unity, the increase of\r\ntrade, the love of pageantry, all aided the art renaissance which was in\r\nprogress before the advent of Italian ideas. No one can say that Gothic\r\narchitecture ended in decrepitude who knows such masterpieces as the\r\nfaçades of Rouen and Beauvais, the towers at Bordeaux, Rodez, and\r\nChartres, the baldaquin and choir screen of Albi, or statuary as ample\r\nin its simplicity as Riom's Virgin of the Bird and \"the Saints\" at\r\nSolesmes. And from end to end of France, as the XVI century opened, such\r\nwork was in progress.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, killed Gothic art? For it was slain with all this warm blood\r\nin its veins. Some say the return to pagan ideals dealt the death blow,\r\nthe deserting of the celestial man-humble ideal for the terrestrial\r\nself-intoxicated pride of the Italian Renaissance: \"The Renaissance is\r\nman seeking knowledge, happiness, and love, outside of Christianity.\" A\r\nChristian had knelt in prayer on a Gothic tomb, or reposed with serene\r\nconfidence, awaiting the trumpet call of the archangel, a Book of Hours\r\nin his hand. On a Renaissance tomb the deceased reclined like a pagan at\r\na feast. The Italian wars diverted from its natural channels the genius\r\nof the northern Latins (who were so strongly Celt and Frank), and in\r\nmany cases the imported neo-classicism was not that of Italy's supreme\r\nmasters, but of the lesser artists, their successors.\r\n\r\nOthers have contended that the printing press and the Protestant\r\nReformation--with its spirit of hostile criticism--proved fatal to the\r\nnational art, since the very life of Gothic was legend, poetry, and\r\ndreams, and symbolism its inspiration. Doubt quickly drained the sources\r\nof life. \"Its charm had been to retain the candor of childhood, the\r\nlimpid book of young saints. It was an art whose faith discussed not--it\r\nsang.\"[386] It was an art happy and bold and free of restraint, save the\r\nrestraint which its own right instinct for discipline\r\nimposed--co-ordinating the multitudinous into a symmetrical unity--an\r\nart unfettered in its truth telling, daring to sculpture king or bishop\r\nmarching to Hell, yet giving no offense to authority by so doing.\r\n\r\nAlas, one must acknowledge that the Church, so long the guardian of\r\nGothic art, dealt a deadly blow at the sweet naïve gayety of the Middle\r\nAges. To reform Catholic Christendom there gathered at Trent a\r\nmuch-needed Council, impregnated with the critical spirit which Luther\r\nhad unloosed. Pious churchmen had come to look askance on legends. They\r\nwere ashamed of the simplicities which the XIII-century man was so\r\ncertain pleased Our Lady, who accepted them with a friendly smile of\r\ncomprehension of her fellow creatures. The good fathers at Trent\r\nregarded prudishly the spiritual passion of the Canticle of Canticles\r\nflaming in cathedral windows; they thought it forwardness to carve\r\nmechanics' tools on altar stones. Such manifestations were excessive.\r\nWhat would our critics of Wittemberg and Geneva say? The mystery plays,\r\nsource of inspiration for the late-Gothic sculptors, now became suspect.\r\nDeprived of popular life, the religious themes grew cold. When censured,\r\nthe creative instinct withered. In 1563 (a year after the iconoclastic\r\noutrages in France) the Council of Trent, at its last session,\r\ncomplained that Gothic artists scandalized the faithful by their\r\nchildish superstitions. The Middle Ages were ended.\r\n\r\nCathedrals are not raised by critics or doubters. When France built her\r\ngreat churches, her faith was humble, her love a mounting flame. Her\r\ncathedrals were symbols of the Kingdom of God in her midst, the _pons\r\nsæculorum_ whereby man passed beyond the bourne of his narrow life. They\r\nwere solaces in his hours of misery, in his delinquencies; they stood\r\nfor justice alike to serf and baron; they were the Sermon on the Mount\r\nmade visible, the _Biblia pauperum_ wherein lettered and unlettered read\r\nthe same lessons; they were the _Credo_ chanted by men who believed in\r\nChrist, Son of the Living God and Son of the Immaculate Virgin.\r\n\r\nNor should it be forgotten that the generations who raised the great\r\ncathedrals believed profoundly in themselves as God's specially loved\r\ninstruments, his own selected knights-errant. \"We are a race that exists\r\nto advance in the world the affairs of God,\" said the old Gallic\r\npatrician to Clovis the Frank, and soon a Frankish parchment ran,\r\n\"_Vivat Christus qui diligit Francos_.\" When men feel like that they are\r\ncompelled to express it grandly. When as pagans they feel it, the\r\nexpression is a cataclysmic war of conquest. When they feel it as\r\nChristians, they build cathedrals. The generations whom St. Bernard\r\npurified, whom Suger trained, whom St. Louis inspired, founded their\r\nchurch on a firm rock, a living rock, lighted it unto a precious stone,\r\nprepared it as a bride adorned for her husband, and ever since sanctity\r\nhas abided therein; kings have brought hither their honors and glory,\r\nand the glory and honor of the people have adorned the walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE\r\n\r\n    Because for once the sword broke in her hand,\r\n      The words she spoke seemed perished for a space;\r\n    All wrong was brazen, and in every land\r\n      The tyrants walked abroad with naked face.\r\n\r\n    The waters turned to blood, as rose the Star\r\n      Of evil fate, denying all release.\r\n    The rulers smote the feeble, crying, \"War!\"\r\n      The usurers robbed the naked, crying, \"Peace!\"\r\n    And her own feet were caught in nets of gold,\r\n      And her own soul profaned by sects that squirm,\r\n    And little men climbed her high seats and sold\r\n      Her honor to the vulture and the worm.\r\n\r\n    And she seemed broken and they thought her dead,\r\n      The Over-Man, so brave against the weak.\r\n    Has your last word of sophistry been said,\r\n      O cult of slaves? Then it is hers to speak.\r\n\r\n    Clear the slow mists from her half-darkened eyes,\r\n      As slow mists parted over Valmy fell,\r\n    And once again her hands in high surprise\r\n      Take hold upon the battlements of Hell.\r\n    --CECIL CHESTERTON (who died a soldier of the World War).\r\n\r\nRegretfully one turns to other interests after spending years in trying\r\nto draw closer to the spirit of the Middle Ages--years that have\r\ncoincided with the apocalyptic struggle that has desolated the classic\r\nregion of the national art, laying low, one after another, the churches\r\nof the first fugitive hour. And watching the giant battle, it has grown\r\nclearer how indissoluble is the solidarity of modern Frenchmen with\r\ntheir achieving grandfathers. A nation's bulwark is the unbroken\r\nsolidarity of Past with Present. And only when _la race lumineuse_,\r\ncompounded of Celt, Gaul, Latin, and Frank, denies that solidarity will\r\nit be conquered.\r\n\r\nThe peasant-soldier of 1914, starting for the front, who replied with\r\ngrave dignity to his well-wisher, \"Whichever way it turns, I am\r\nready,\"[387] would have met death like a paladin at Roncevaux, in 778,\r\nholding up his gauntlet to God, his suzerain, certain of the justice of\r\nHim who from the grave raised Blessed Lazarus, and Daniel saved from\r\nlions.\r\n\r\nThe young tradesman of 1915 who wrote from the trenches to one who\r\nloved him: \"I look on this struggle less as a war against an enemy than\r\nas a crusade to reinstate God in his place in France,\" was true to his\r\n_race apostolique_ that sets the church bells ringing. At Clermont, in\r\n1095, he pressed forward with the cry: \"The cross! The cross! God wills\r\nit!\" The priest-soldier offering sacrifice at an improvised altar within\r\nhearing of the guns, his spurs fretting his sacerdotal gown, is Turpin,\r\nguarding well the Cross and France.\r\n\r\nThe stricken lad, flung back, diseased from the prisons beyond the\r\nRhine, weak, broken, in tatters, who cried with vibrant voice, as he and\r\nhis comrades crossed the Swiss frontier, and friendly strangers gathered\r\nround: \"_La tête haute! C'est nous la France!_\" conquered Jerusalem with\r\nGodfrey de Bouillon in the olden days, and related his prowess in a\r\nlegend-medallion window at Chartres.\r\n\r\nAbove all, lives the soul of the Past in the generalissimo to whom a\r\nrighteous destiny granted the freeing of his land from invaders. In\r\nchurches shattered by shell fire he knelt daily--the weightiest fruit\r\nbending lowest--and he begged that the children of Christendom lift up\r\ntheir little white hands to heaven to petition for his endurance. In\r\n1249, with flashing sword and the cry, \"_Montjoie-St.-Denis_,\" he sprang\r\ninto the surf beside his saint-king, following the oriflamme as it\r\ntouched African soil. We have seen them alive again, the cathedral\r\nbuilders, the commune winners, the crusaders, dying with the farewell\r\nsigh, \"_Ha! doulce France!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd thank God the flame is unquenchable, thank God that in the French\r\nrace is the underlying sentiment for the Infinite, that peasant,\r\nartisan, student, priest, and chief feel the same humility and the same\r\nproper pride as those who built Soissons, the lovely stricken virgin;\r\nand Laon the intrepid, braving the hammer of Odin and Thor; Amiens the\r\nperfect, menaced and shaken but spared to us; and tragic, immortal\r\nRheims, symbol of a people's resurrection. To herald the dawn is the\r\nmission of France, to look on her deeds as _Gesta Dei per Francos_.\r\n\"Hers is the hand that scatters the seed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The heavy figures appearing here and there in the index indicate\r\nthe pages in which a complete description of the subject is given.

Her school was formulated\r\nearly. By 1040 Jumièges abbey church was begun, and within thirty years\r\nthe two abbeys of Caen were building. Norman Romanesque used the\r\nalternate system of piers, a central lantern tower, cubic capitals, and\r\na geometric sculpture. Their architects were inclined to be\r\novercautious; up to the advent of Gothic they often covered the middle\r\nnave with a timber roof, though they vaulted the side aisles with stone.\r\n\r\n_Burgundy's_ Romanesque school was bolder. Groin and barrel vaultings\r\ncovered side aisles and central vessel; and the transverse arches which\r\nbraced the vaulting were often pointed, since it was found that such an\r\narch exerted less side thrust. Some of Burgundy's monastic churches were\r\nas lofty and spacious as the coming Gothic cathedrals. However, to\r\nobtain proper lighting by clearstory windows she sacrificed stability,\r\nand years later the Gothic builders had to add flying buttresses to\r\nprevent the collapse of the Romanesque churches. In this region where\r\nGallo-Roman art had flourished, channeled pilasters were used. As was to\r\nbe expected of the province where Cluny's arts and crafts were centered,\r\nBurgundy was a leader in monumental sculpture, and such portals as\r\nAvallon, Autun, and Vézelay attest her skill.\r\n\r\n_Auvergne_ produced a distinctive Romanesque school. Her art sprang\r\ndirect from the ancient Roman traditions in the province. More cautious\r\nthan her neighbor Burgundy, she soon gave up trying to light her upper\r\nnave by clearstory windows, but obtained light indirectly from side\r\naisles and from a central tower. A precocious use of the ambulatory and\r\nof apse chapels appeared in the region. The two most striking features\r\nof her churches were the octagonal central tower set on a barlong base,\r\nand the apse whose exterior walls were decorated by the volcanic\r\npolychrome stones of the district.\r\n\r\n_Poitou's_ Romanesque school also developed early, and it, too,\r\nsacrificed spaciousness to solidity. The side aisles were made of almost\r\nequal height as the central vessel, and one roof covered all. The church\r\ninteriors were often somber and cramped. The apse exterior was\r\nornamented, and the boast of the region is its richly sculptured façades\r\nof which that of Notre-Dame-la-Grande at Poitiers is one of the best\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n_Languedoc_ built Romanesque churches of the first rank, such as St.\r\nSernin at Toulouse, but the school had no definite uniformity. Sometimes\r\nit combined with the Romanesque of Poitou, sometimes with that of\r\nAuvergne, or of Burgundy. Because of Cluny affiliations, the Midi school\r\nwas strong in sculpture--witness Beaulieu, Cahors, Moissac, and\r\nToulouse.\r\n\r\n_Provence_ Romanesque covered a more limited area. Usually the churches\r\nwere aisleless, with a simple apse. A flat stone roof was laid directly\r\non the barrel vaulting, which had pointed transverse ribs like those of\r\nBurgundy. Provence also used the fluted pilasters of antiquity. The many\r\nremains of Gallo-Roman sculpture in the region served as models for the\r\nnotable imaged portals at St. Gilles and Arles.\r\n\r\n_The Franco-Picard_ school had scarcely developed when it was supplanted\r\nby the nascent Gothic art. Besides these regional schools, two unique\r\nexperiments in vaulting were essayed, though neither spread far afield.\r\nAt Tournus, in the abbey church of St. Philibert was built a series of\r\nbarrel vaults (carried on lintels) placed side by side transversely over\r\nthe central vessel. And in Aquitaine, in the region of Périgueux and\r\nAngoulême, spreading in a line, north and south, arose a number of\r\nchurches, each bay of which was covered by a cupola. Both these\r\nexperiments were but partial solutions. While mediæval archæology was\r\nobscure, the pointed arch was looked on as the _sine qua non_ of Gothic,\r\nand it was puzzling to find it in certain Romanesque churches, like\r\nthose in Burgundy and Provence. The pointed arch was in use in Persia,\r\nin the VI century, and the Arabs early brought the form to Egypt,\r\nSicily, and Spain. From the XI century it had appeared sporadically in\r\nChristian Europe. Such arches were not the first step in a new\r\narchitecture, but were used either as a decorative feature or as an\r\nexpedient to lessen the side thrust of a vault. From outside of France\r\ntwo schools of Romanesque art, the Lombard and the Rhenish, exerted\r\nconsiderable influences on their neighbor, but the forces paramount in\r\neach of the local French schools were the pre-Lombardic pre-Rhenish\r\ninheritances from Rome, blended with indigenous traditions.\r\n\r\n[11] Rome had used some brick lines under the surface of certain of her\r\ngroin vaults. They performed no separate function, but were embedded in\r\nthe vaults' concrete. The true Gothic vault has the ribs independent of\r\nthe infilling. In their elasticity is their strength.\r\n\r\n[12] G. T.

The diagonals do not curve, as do those of Morienval.\r\nSt. Maclou was entirely finished in the XII century, but it was\r\nreconstructed radically in the XV century: the present façade is\r\n1450-70. Again in the XVI century the church was partly rebuilt, so that\r\nthe double-aisled nave of to-day appears a beautiful example of\r\nRenaissance art.

The corpse\r\nof Louis XIV presented an air of serene majesty. When the coffin of\r\nLouis XV was opened the air was infected insupportably. On that same day\r\nin October, 1793, Marie Antoinette mounted the scaffold. Her remains and\r\nthose of Louis XVI are to-day laid in the inner core of St. Denis'\r\ncrypt.\r\n\r\n[37] E.

St. Médard gave the veil to Queen Radegund in the\r\nMerovingian cathedral of Noyon. Two Carolingian cathedrals stood in\r\nsuccession on the site: in the first, Charlemagne was consecrated king,\r\n768, Noyon being his residence before Aix-la-Chapelle; in the second\r\nchurch, which rose after a Norman sacking, Hugues Capet was elected king\r\nshortly before 1000--the first monarch of the House of Capet, which was\r\nto rule over France during seven hundred years. Since the Revolution the\r\nsees of Noyon, Senlis, and Laon have been suppressed.\r\n\r\n[46] The abbey church of Ourscamp is a ruin, but with the choir and\r\nambulatory of the end of the XIII century partly standing. Where once\r\nwere the piers of the nave have been planted two rows of poplars. Like\r\nLongpont and Royaumont, it was a Cistercian church that paid no heed to\r\nSt. Bernard's strictures on lavish architecture. The former infirmary of\r\nthe monastery, now used as a factory, is one of the most graceful civic\r\nhalls of the age (c. 1240); Peigné-Delacour, _Histoire de l'abbaye de\r\nNotre Dame d'Ourscamp_ (1876), in 4to; _Congrés Archéologique_, 1905, p.\r\n165, on Ourscamp.\r\n\r\n[47] Camille Enlart, _De l'influence germanique dans les premiers\r\nmonuments gothiques de la France_, 1902.\r\n\r\n[48] Marcel Aubert, _Monographie de la cathédrale de Senlis_ (1907).

In Flamboyant Gothic times the abbatial was rebuilt, but again\r\nit was wrecked in the XVIII century. Only a few late-Gothic bays now\r\nstand on the lawn before the country house of the Comte Boula de\r\nCoulomier. Bishop Guérin also consecrated the church of Chaalis abbey,\r\nwhere he was buried in 1228. Chaalis is now a picturesque ruin.\r\n\r\n[53] E.

It\r\nis a sort of forerunner of the Sainte-Chapelle type of edifice, without\r\naisles or transept. Its sober, pure lines show faultless constructive\r\nskill, and a grievous pity is its present abandonment. Behind the\r\ncathedral is the church of St. Pierre, built in six different epochs:\r\nthe lower stories of the tower, XI century; the choir and transept,\r\n1260; the piers of the nave and the north tower's top story, XV century;\r\nthe rich façade, XVI century, a work of Pierre Chambiges; and the heavy,\r\ncold south tower, of the XVII century. In Senlis are St. Vincent's\r\nchurch with a choir built after 1136, a XII-century tower, contemporary\r\nof the cathedral, and a groin roof of the XVIII century. St. Aignan's\r\nbelfry is of the end of the XI century, and served as model for the\r\ntowers of St. Vincent and St. Pierre, just as all three of them\r\ncontributed toward the inspiration of that sovereign thing of Senlis,\r\nthe cathedral tower.\r\n\r\n[55] _Congrès Archéologique_, 1907, p. 205, Charles Porée; E.\r\nChartraire, _La cathédrale de Sens_ (Petites Monographies), (Paris, H.\r\nLaurens, 1920); E.

The XIII-century donjon was\r\nthe most massive conception of the Middle Ages. Coucy's lord ruled a\r\nhundred towns and was one of the big figures in feudal France. His proud\r\ndevice read: \"_Roi ne suis, ne prince, ne duc, ne comte aussi--Je suis\r\nle sire de Coucy_.\" The superb pile has been demolished in the World\r\nWar. Madame Yvonne Sarcey visited Coucy in April, 1917. Of the imposing\r\nmediæval castle, hanging like a bourg to the flank of the hill, there\r\nremain two gaping porticos. \"_C'est tout!...

Longpont, where\r\nthe bishops of Soissons were buried, was founded by Gerard de Chérisy,\r\nwho had married Lady Agnes of Longpont. St. Bernard sent twelve\r\nCistercian monks to start the new house in 1131. The splendid Gothic\r\nchurch, which departed from Cîteaux's rule of church simplicity, was\r\nconsecrated in 1227 before the queen regent and Louis IX, by the bishop\r\nof Soissons, Jacques de Bazoches, who had just anointed Louis as king,\r\nat Rheims. Longpont was sacked by the Huguenots in 1567, and wrecked by\r\nthe Revolution. The picturesque ruins were acquired by the de\r\nMontesquieu family in 1850.\r\n\r\n[62] The monastery church of St. Jean-des-Vignes was in size a\r\ncathedral, and the maker of the great façade at Rheims, Bernard de\r\nSoissons, is said to have designed it. The cloisters, once the most\r\nsumptuous in the kingdom, were begun by an abbot who died in 1224, after\r\nhe had built an aqueduct for the city which still is in use. St. Jean's\r\nbig west rose had been, since 1870, an empty circle. Little more than\r\nits façade and western towers stood before 1914. Sacked by the\r\nRevolution, its real demolition was under the Empire, when to repair the\r\ncathedral the deserted monastery was sold for a paltry sum, and stone by\r\nstone removed. The congregation of good men in this abbey did parish\r\nwork for many centuries. In such good repute with the citizens were they\r\nthat, when the Revolution suppressed the house, Soissons' municipality\r\nprotested, saying that the abbey had \"always claimed with zeal its share\r\nof public duties.\" Taine in his _L'Ancien Régime_ quotes the protest:\r\n\"In calamities this abbey opens its doors to the destitute citizens and\r\nfeeds them. It alone has borne the expense of the citizens' meetings,\r\npreparatory to the election of deputies for the National Assembly. It\r\nnow is lodging a company of soldiers. Always when there are sacrifices\r\nto be made it is on hand.\" However, the revolutionary authorities paid\r\nno heed to the citizens' desire to retain their historic house.\r\n\r\n[63] For the churches of Notre Dame and St. Martins, at Étampes, see\r\n_Bulletin Monumental_, 1905, vol. 69, and _Annales de la Société hist.\r\net archéol. du gatinais_, 1907, Lefèvre-Pontalis; also the _Congrès\r\nArchéologique_, 1901, p. 71. Notre Dame was begun about 1160. Its\r\nstrongly Romanesque south portal is of the same type as Chartres'\r\nwestern doors. The crypt and piers of the nave are XI century, and the\r\ntransept and choir were rebuilt about 1170 as early Gothic. The\r\nRomanesque tower is one of the best of its epoch; its base is\r\napproximately 1050; the next two stories about 1075; the fourth story,\r\n1125; and the spire, 1130. The church is full of irregularities from\r\nrebuildings. St. Martin's church is XII and XIII century; its much\r\ndiscussed ambulatory of the Champagne type is about 1165. The number of\r\nsupports for the vault was doubled in the outer wall, thus making the\r\nspace to be covered a series of square compartments alternating with\r\ntriangles.\r\n\r\n[64] Auguste Rodin, _Les cathédrales de France_ (Paris, A.

He took his stand on a palpable\r\nfact--the existence of creatures. He began with the fecund idea of\r\nmotion, the stars in their orbits, man engendering man. If there is\r\nmovement there must be a First Motor. If there ever had been an instant\r\nwhen nothing was, nothing ever would have been. Effects must have a\r\ncause. Either nothing is, which is an absurdity, or there must be One\r\nBeing eternally immutable.\r\n\r\nThat the movement is ordered, such as night and day, season following\r\nseason, shows a supreme power directing. That creatures are more or less\r\nperfect supposes a perfect being. One by one Aquinas laid his foundation\r\nstones till a solid lower wall was built, on which he reared his\r\nmajestic structure. In the Roman Breviary, he is thus recorded: \"Thou\r\nhast written well of me, Thomas, what recompense do you ask of me?\"\r\n\"None but yourself, Lord!\" (\"_Non aliam, Domine, nisi te ipsum!_\").\r\n\r\n[77] The father of St. Thomas was the Count of Aquin, nephew of the\r\nEmperor Frederick Barbarossa. His mother came of the line of the Norman\r\nrulers in Sicily; the same stocks produced that undisciplined,\r\nundecipherable genius of the XIII century, Frederick II.\r\n\r\n[78] L.

Monseigneur Affre was shot on the barricades, in 1848,\r\nwhen he went forth bearing a message of peace. Monseigneur Darboy was\r\nshot in prison by the Commune of 1871. Both are commemorated in side\r\nchapels of the cathedral's choir.\r\n\r\n[83] G.

Some\r\nXVI-century glass is still to be found in St. Merri and St.\r\nGermain-l'Auxerrois, for which churches see Huysman's _Trois églises et\r\ntrois primitifs_ (1908). St Étienne-du-Mont has in a chapel an Engrand\r\nLe Prince window, a symbolic wine press with portraits of Pope Paul II,\r\nCharles V, Francis I, and Henry VIII; and reset in the passage leading\r\nto the catechism chapel is the masterpiece of Pinaigrier, twelve panels\r\nthat are veritable enameling on glass. In St. Gervais, where on Good\r\nFriday, 1918, a projectile from the long-distance German gun crashed\r\nthrough the masonry roof, killing many, are two windows, Solomon's\r\njudgment (1531), and St. Laurence (1551), said to be by Jean Cousin,\r\nalso some Pinaigrier glass. To Jean Cousin are attributed the five\r\nsplendid windows of the Apocalypse in the chapel at Vincennes, whose\r\ndesign derives from Dürer's woodcuts, published in 1498. They have deep\r\nshadows and are strong in color and plan. M. Mâle says that Dürer's\r\nGerman has here been translated into graceful Renaissance Italian.\r\nVincennes' chapel had been begun by Charles V in 1378. Then came the\r\npause of a century, and the works were finished by Henry II, still on\r\nthe Gothic plan, however. Henry donated the windows and he had Diana of\r\nPoitiers pictured among the righteous souls in the fifth seal of the\r\nApocalypse. Francis I is represented at the base of the second window.\r\nExcursions can be made from Paris to places within easy distance that\r\nposses Gothic-Renaissance glass. At Écouen, nine miles from Paris, in\r\nthe church of St. Acceul, are sixteen windows due to De Montmorency\r\npatronage. Originally in Écouen's guard hall were the forty-four panels\r\n(made for the constable, Anne de Montmorency) now in the long gallery of\r\nChantilly, the château bequeathed to the Institute of France in 1897 by\r\nthe Duc d'Aumale. The story of Cupid and Psyche is told in that camaïeu\r\nglass so suited for domestic decoration, a species of iron-red\r\ngrisaille, whose only other hue is yellow stain. Chantilly's panels were\r\npainted in the Raphaelesque style by the Flemish master, Coexyen,\r\ntrained in Van Orley's school. At Montmorency, ten miles from Paris, in\r\nSt. Martin's church, the history of France seems written in the windows,\r\nwith the portraits of Francis I, Henry II, Adrian VI, and members of the\r\nhouses of Montmorency, Pot, and Coligny. Three of the lights are by\r\nEngrand Le Prince. More portrait work appears in the many windows at\r\nMontfort l'Amaury, twenty-nine miles from Paris (1544-78), work not\r\nequal to the earlier XVI-century glass.\r\n\r\nH.

It\r\nis one of the best works of Gothic civic architecture in France. It\r\nstands on the site of Roman baths, alleged to be those of Julian the\r\nApostate, above which had later risen a residence of the Merovingian\r\nkings. In the time of the Carolings, Alcuin taught on this spot. The\r\nPalais des Termes was purchased for Cluny by Abbot Pierre de Chastellux\r\n(1322-43). H. Havard, éd., _La France artistique et monumentale_, vol.\r\n1, p. 161, A. Darcel, on Musée Cluny; E. du Sommerard, _Le palais des\r\nthermes et l'Hôtel de Cluny_; Ch. Normand, _l'Hôtel de Cluny_ (Paris,\r\n1888).\r\n\r\n[89] Paul Abadie, who over-restored the cathedrals of Angoulême and\r\nPérigieux, won the competition for the national memorial basilica of the\r\nSacré-Coeur, and began his strange Romano-Byzantine monument in 1873.\r\nHe united Auvergne's Romanesque ambulatory with the cupola church of\r\nAquitaine. There is not sufficient contrast between his elongated dome\r\nand the tower. Nevertheless, the immense pile of white stone standing\r\nover the capital presents exotic and superb effects in sun and mist, and\r\nno one can deny that a profound religious spirit breathes in this new\r\nshrine of France, as if the prayers and sufferings of generations had\r\nalready hallowed its walls. Below the basilica stands a statue of the\r\nyoung Chevalier de la Barre, a victim of the personal intrigue of a\r\ncorrupt magistrate of Abbeville and the lax law courts of Louis XV's\r\ntime, not in any way the object of clerical hate, as the inscription on\r\nhis statue would indicate. His abbess aunt was his warm defender, as was\r\nthe bishop of Amiens, and on the day of his execution he received the\r\nsacraments piously. See Cruppi, _Révue des Deux Mondes_, March, 1895. As\r\nthis mythical hero meets one in many a French city, it were well to know\r\nhis real story.\r\n\r\n[90] Some of the later manifestations of Gothic art in the capital are\r\nthe porch and façade of St. Germain l'Auxerrois (1431-39), one of the\r\nfirst signs of renewed energy after Jeanne d'Arc's mission; the tower of\r\nSt. Jacques (1508-22), attributed to the late-Gothic master, Martin\r\nChambiges, and formerly part of a Flamboyant church destroyed by the\r\nRevolution; and the church of St. Merri (1520-1612), still Gothic in\r\nspirit. Th e Renaissance appears in St. Étienne-du-Mont (1517-63), whose\r\ninterior is alluringly graceful, though it cannot boast of purity of\r\nstyle. St. Eustache (1532-1642), begun slightly after St. Merri, has a\r\nGothic skeleton, \"dressed in Renaissance robes sewed together like the\r\npieces of a harlequin's garment, bizarre and contradictory, satisfactory\r\nto neither taste nor reason.\" The old church of St. Séverin used to be\r\nemployed by M. Jules Quicherat as an object lesson for his pupils, since\r\nfour different epochs are traceable in it; the three westernmost bays of\r\nthe nave are early XIII century; and there is much Flamboyant Gothic\r\nwith disappearing moldings.

The second was the wife of\r\nKing Henry's brother, Richard of Cornwall, who was titular emperor of\r\nGermany. The youngest sister inherited Provence and wedded St. Louis'\r\nbrother, Charles d'Anjou, king of the Two Sicilies. E. Boutarie,\r\n_Marguerite de Provence, femme de St. Louis_ (Paris, 1869); E. Berger,\r\n_Blanche de Castille_ (Paris, 1900).\r\n\r\n[94] Joinville, in Syria, went to the Krak, the great Christian fortress\r\nbeyond the Jordan, to obtain, as a relic for his church at Joinville,\r\nthe shield of his crusading ancestor whom Richard Coeur-de-Lion had\r\nadmired. His \"_beau chastel_\" on the Marne was wrecked by the\r\nRevolution. His line had ended in an heiress who married into the ruling\r\nhouse of Lorraine, so that the XVI-century Duke of Guise, whose personal\r\ncharm made him the idol of the French people, was fifth, by female\r\ndescent, from the irresistible seneschal. A brother of Joinville's,\r\nGeoffrey, married Mahaut de Lacy, heiress of Meath, and became Lord\r\nChief Justice of Ireland in 1273. Under Henry III and Edward I he played\r\na role, and went crusading in 1270. He left nine children. On his wife's\r\ndeath he entered the Dominican convent of Tuam, where he died in 1314.\r\n\r\n[95] Often did Louis IX sigh over his youngest brother. \"Charles\r\nd'Anjou! Charles d'Anjou!\" he would say, sadly. As king of the Two\r\nSicilies, Charles won the title of the Merciless, and his harshness was\r\npunished by the Sicilian Vespers, 1282. Dante abominated the house of\r\nAnjou in Italy. Of Charles he wrote in the _Paradiso_ (viii: 73-75),\r\n\"His evil rule, which ever cuts into the heart of subject people, caused\r\nPalermo to shriek out: 'Die! Die!'\" St. Louis loved especially his\r\nbrother Robert d'Artois, whose overhardy courage caused the defeat of\r\nthe crusaders at Mansourah. When word was brought to the king of his\r\nbrother's death in that battle, tears warm and full fell from his eyes,\r\nthough he said, \"God must be thanked for all he sends.\" The other\r\nbrother of Louis IX was Alphonse of Poitiers, who married the heiress of\r\nToulouse and took guidance of the king in his administration of the\r\nMidi.\r\n\r\n[96] In 1841 Louis-Philippe built a chapel on the site where St. Louis\r\nhad died in Tunis, 1270.

St. Pierre's choir is Romanesque and early Gothic; its\r\nsanctuary is a gem of XIV-century Rayonnant; its nave is in larger part\r\nof the XIII century, but later than the cathedral of Chartres; its west\r\ntower is of the XI century. At present it possesses a treasure of enamel\r\nwork, the plaques of the apostles, by Léonard Limosin, which Francis I\r\nhad made in 1545, and which Henry II gave to Diana de Poitiers for the\r\nchâteau of Anet. There is much grisaille glass in St. Pierre; each\r\nwindow of the nave is divided perpendicularly into three panels--a\r\ncolored one in the center and grisailles on either side. In the choir is\r\nsome XII-century glass; the brilliant apse windows are XIV century, as\r\nare a few in the nave. P.

The tapestries of Rheims were\r\nsaved from the wrecked city and exhibited in Paris during the World War\r\nfor the benefit of the refugees.

Nothing can be more quaint and charming\r\nthan the difference shown in their way of responding to the final trump.\r\nThe good get out of their tombs with a certain modest gayety, an\r\nalacrity tempered by respect; one of them kneels to pray as soon as he\r\nhas disinterred himself.

The portal, part of\r\nthe choir, and the apse chapel escaped. The XII-century nave had double\r\naisles with tribunes; the frontispiece also was XII century. The choir,\r\nbegun in 1287, was finished by 1297, and a new Gothic nave was in\r\nprogress at the time of the civil wars of religion. Henry IV undertook\r\nto rebuild Orléans Cathedral, and with his bride, Marie de Medici, laid\r\nthe first stone in 1601. But a bastard-Gothic edifice is not\r\ncompensation for earlier work. H.

As the preaching bishop exhorted modern France to remake her\r\nsoul else she would perish, over that spellbound congregation seemed to\r\npass a premonition of portentous events looming ahead.

A list of the Romanesque monuments of the\r\nIle-de-France and bordering districts is to be found in Arthur Kingsley\r\nPorter's _Medieval Architecture_, 1909, vol. 2, pp. 13-49.\r\n\r\n[141] Among the Flamboyant monuments of France are St. Wulfran's\r\nfrontispiece at Abbeville, begun in 1481, overcharged with ornament but\r\nwith portals of great beauty; St. Riquier near by, also overcharged; the\r\nchurches of Rue and Mézières; façades of cathedrals at Sens, Senlis,\r\nAuxerre, Troyes, Tours, and Limoges; Vendôme's frontispiece, and Albi's\r\nporch; towers at Bordeaux, Rodez, Saintes, Chartres, Auxerre, Bourges,\r\nRouen, and many other cities in Normandy; the cathedrals of Toul and\r\nMetz; St. Maurice at Lille, a well-restrained Flamboyant monument; the\r\nmagnificent church of St. Nicholas-du-Port near Nancy; the choir of\r\nMoulins; St. Antoine at Compiègne and a number of civic halls such as\r\nCompiègne's and St. Quentin's. The beautiful Flamboyant Gothic church at\r\nPéronne (1509-25) has been wiped out in the World War. Artois and\r\nFlanders were especially rich in late-Gothic edifices. Normandy was a\r\nMecca of Flamboyant work--from Rouen, to that gem of the final phase,\r\nthe choir of Mont Saint-Michel.

Assier, _Les arts dans\r\nl'ancienne capitale de la Champagne_.\r\n\r\n[146] The same feat can be seen in St. Nizier at Troyes, rebuilt in 1528\r\nand literally filled with XVI-century glass. Its best window is in the\r\ntransept (1552), and shows the beasts of heresy trampled upon, for that\r\nday was nothing if not controversial. In a central window of the choir,\r\nthe Descent of the Holy Ghost, the artist made the hands of a figure in\r\none panel appear in the neighboring panel, regardless of the stone\r\nmullions. In 1901 an anarchist bomb exploded in St. Nizier, and in 1910\r\na terrible storm wrecked more of its windows. The church possesses a\r\n_Saint Sépulcre_ and a _Christ de Pité_ in which the Gothic spirit\r\nlingers. Its reredos, now in the Museum, was from the Juliot _atelier_.\r\nHer international fairs early accustomed Troyes to foreign influences.\r\nFlemish realism had fortified her sculptors and vitrine artists, and\r\nduring the first third of the XVI century (when the trade of the city\r\ntripled itself) the new Italian ideas found favor. For a generation the\r\njust and loyal measure of Champagne's own Gothic tradition held the\r\nleadership, but finally the Italian Renaissance conquered. When abstract\r\ntypes were substituted for types precisely observed, imagery became\r\ncold, declamatory, and pretentious. In several of the churches of Troyes\r\nwill be found the Education of the Virgin by her mother, St. Anne, a\r\ntheme for which this city had a partiality.\r\n\r\n[147] Abbé O. F. Jossier, _Monographie des vitraux de St. Urbain de\r\nTroyes_ (Troyes, 1912); E.

Maure, with a Jesse\r\ntree by Linard Gontier; Les Noès, with good sculpture and a Jesse-tree\r\nwindow of 1521; St. André-lès-Troyes, with a lovely St. Catherine\r\nstatue; St. Parre-les-Tertres, with a Vision of Augustus in _camaïeu_\r\nlike a magnificent enamel on white glass, and another grisaille-like\r\nVision of Augustus at St. Léger-lès-Troyes (1558); Chapelle St. Luc,\r\nwith a triptych on wood, sculpture of the Three Maries, and good glass;\r\nTorvilliers, Pont-Ste.-Marie, and Montgueux, with other _objets d'art_.\r\nEight miles away, at Verrières, is the best portal of the region and\r\nmore late-Gothic glass. There are storied windows at St. Loup, St.\r\nPonanges, Rosnay, Brienne, Rouilly (with a good Virgin image), Pouvres,\r\nChavanges, Bar-sur-Seine, Bar-sur-Aube (with a statue of St. Barbara),\r\nMussy-sur-Seine, Montier-en-Der, Arcis-sur-Aube, and Ceffonds, whose\r\nwindows were the gift of Étienne Chévalier (1528). Some thirty miles\r\naway lies St. Florentin (six miles from Pontigny), where are twenty\r\nsplendid Renaissance lights, among them a Creation window (1525), with\r\nGod the Father wearing the tiara, one of 1528 telling St. Nicolas' life\r\nin quatrains describing each scene, and a 1529 window devoted to the\r\nApocalypse. Between Troyes and St. Florentin lies Ervy, where is a\r\nCrucifixion window (1570), showing the Saviour nailed to a Tree of\r\nKnowledge Cross with apples and leaves on its top, and Adam and Eve\r\nstanding below. There are also the noted windows of the Sibyls (1515),\r\nrepresenting twelve instead of ten prophetesses, each accompanied by the\r\nevent of the New Law which she is said to have foretold, and the window\r\ncalled the Triumph of Petrarch (1502).\r\n\r\n[149] Of the same appealing type as St. Martha at Troyes are the Virgin\r\nand Madeleine of the Holy Sepulcher group at Villeneuve l'Archevêque\r\n(Yonne), where are also some beautiful portal images of the XIII\r\ncentury. M. Ch. Fichot has brought forward testimony that would indicate\r\nthe image called St. Martha in the church of the Madeleine is really one\r\nof St. Mary Magdelene herself. However, the majority of those who have\r\nwritten on the sculpture of Champagne continue to call it a St. Martha.\r\n\r\n[150] _Congrès Archéologique_, 1855, 1875, and 1911, p. 447, the\r\ncathedral of Châlons; p. 473, Notre-Dame-en-Vaux; p. 496, St. Alpin; p.\r\n512, Notre-Dame-de-l'Épine; E.

Why has not Tours named her chief square and residential street\r\nfor Balzac, her own son, instead of for Emile Zola? Balzac's sister has\r\ntold of the profound impression made on him by the cathedral of Tours,\r\nespecially by its marvels of stained glass, so that all through the\r\nnovelist's life the mere name \"St. Gatien\" had the power to rouse him to\r\nthe dreams and aspirations of his youth.\r\n\r\n[155] R. de Lasteyrie, _L'église St. Martin de Tours_ (Paris, 1891);\r\nMonsuyer, _Histoire de l'abbaye de St. Martin_; Henri Martin,\r\n_Saint-Martin_ (Collection, _L'art et les saints_), (Paris, H. Laurens);\r\nEd. Chévalier, _Histoire de l'abbaye de Marmoutier_ (Tours, 1871), 2\r\nvols. There are papers on the church of St. Julien de Tours in the\r\n_Mémoires de la Soc. archéol. de Touraine_, 1909, p. 13, and on St.\r\nMartin de Tours, 1907; also in the _Bulletin Monumental_, 1873, p. 830,\r\non St. Symphorien de Tours. The abbatial of St. Julien, a contemporary\r\nof Tours Cathedral, is exceptionally pure Gothic. Its tower is\r\nRomanesque and in part dates before 1000.\r\n\r\n[156] Many a Council has been held in Tours. In 1055 came Gregory VII,\r\nthe reformer. In 1095 Urban II preached the First Crusade, and dedicated\r\na Romanesque abbatial at Marmoutier. In 1107 Pope Paschal II came, in\r\n1119 Calixtus II, in 1134 Innocent II, and Alexander III in 1163. At the\r\nCouncil of 1163 the new archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, pleaded\r\nfor St. Anselm's canonization, and the builder of Lisieux Cathedral, the\r\npolitic Arnoul, delivered an address that urged the unity and liberty of\r\nthe Church; yet later he upheld Henry II in his dispute with St. Thomas\r\nBecket. Tours can even boast a pope, for Martin IV (d. 1285) had long\r\nbeen a canon in St. Martin's abbey.\r\n\r\n[157] Such is the architectural wealth within reach of Tours that one\r\ncan draw but a few monuments to the traveler's attention. At Amboise is\r\nSt. Hubert's marvelously sculptured little chapel (c. 1491) and the\r\nchurch of St. Florentin (c. 1445). At Loches is Anne of Brittany's\r\noratory, a Virgin statue of Michel Colombe's school of Tours, and the\r\ntomb of Agnes Sorel, attributed to the master who made Souvigny's ducal\r\ntomb, Jacques Morel. The collegiate church of St. Ours is of exceptional\r\ninterest to archæologists; its narthex (now the first bay), covered by a\r\ntower, was built by Fulk II of Anjou; the porch, also with a tower over\r\nit, was added in the XII century. To that date belong the two bays of\r\nthe church covered by hollow pyramids, said by Mr. A. Kingsley Porter to\r\nbe an attempt to make a stone roof without wooden centering. At\r\nBeaulieu-lès-Loches, founded by Fulk Nerra, the choir is late-Gothic\r\n(1440-1540). At St. Catherine de Fierbois, where Jeanne d'Arc found her\r\nsword, is a charming Flamboyant Gothic church. There are Plantagenet\r\nGothic vaults at Chinon. Nine miles from Chinon, at Champigny-sur-Veude,\r\nis a rich mass of Renaissance glass attributed to Pinagrier, with\r\nBourbon-Montpensier portraits.\r\n\r\nSome twenty miles from Blois is the Romanesque church of Fleury Abbey at\r\nSt. Benoît-sur-Loire, with a superb XI-century narthex of three bays,\r\nsurmounted by a tower. In 1562 the Huguenots wrecked the church. Also,\r\nbetween Orléans and Nevers, beside Sancerre, is the abbey church of St.\r\nSatur, a forerunner of Flamboyant Gothic, as early as 1361. The\r\nBenedictine church of La Charité-sur-Loire derives chiefly from the\r\nBurgundian Romanesque school, influenced by Berry and Auvergne. Its\r\ncentral and west towers, its nave, and chevet belong to the second half\r\nof the XII century, the transept is earlier; there was a reconstruction\r\nof the nave after 1559.\r\n\r\nLouis Serbat, \"La Charité-sur-Loire,\" in _Congrès Archéologique_, 1913,\r\np. 374; Abbe Bosseboeuf, _Amboise_.

Another\r\nromance based on reality whose scene is Lyons is René Bazin's\r\n_l'Isolée_. An ancient crypt under St. Nizier, shaped like a Greek\r\ncross, dedicated to St. Pothin since the IV century, has been ruined by\r\nrestorations; the actual church is Rayonnant and Flamboyant Gothic, with\r\na portal of the Renaissance by a son of Lyons, Philibert Delorme (d.\r\n1570). Jean Perréal was also born here, as was Coysevox, who made the\r\nVirgin of St. Nizier (1676). Eminence in religious or idealistic mural\r\npainting has been attained by two sons of Lyons, Puvis de Chavannes\r\n(1824-98), who decorated the Museum with _Le Bois Sacré_, and Flandrin\r\n(1809-64), who frescoed the walls of St. Martin d'Ainay. Meissonier (d.\r\n1891) was born here; so was Ampère, scientist and Christian believer (d.\r\n1836). In the hospital of fifteen thousand free beds which opened its\r\ndoors in the VI century and has never since closed them, worked a loved\r\nphysician who was father of Frédéric Ozanam, the founder of the Society\r\nof St. Vincent de Paul. St. Vincent's heart is treasured in a chapel of\r\nthe cathedral. Another of the leaders of the Catholic reform, St.\r\nFrancis de Sales, died in Lyons in 1622.\r\n\r\n[161] The see of Vienne was founded A.D. 160. The cathedral of St.\r\nMaurice, well set on the Rhone, contains vestiges of the church\r\nconsecrated in 1106 by Paschal II, and which had been aided by that\r\narchbishop of Vienne, of the first line of Burgundy's Capetian dukes,\r\nwho became Pope Calixtus II in 1119. The present edifice is due to\r\nBishop Jean de Bernin (1218-66), and was consecrated by Innocent IV in\r\n1251. Only in 1533 were its façade and the four bays behind it finished.\r\nThere is no transept. The XV century made the northern entrance, and the\r\nXVI century that to the south. The red incrustations form friezes, in\r\nthe choir, below both triforium and clearstory.\r\n\r\nA V-century bishop of Vienne was Claudianus Mamertus, who upheld Latin\r\nculture against the Barbarians, like his friend and fellow poet, Bishop\r\nApollinaris Sidonius at Clermont. To Vienne's bishop is attributed the\r\nnoted hymn _Pange lingua gloriosi proclium certamini_, and the\r\ninstitution of the Rogation days of penance and procession before the\r\nAscension, in that hour when earthquakes and volcanic eruptions had\r\nterrorized central France. In 1312 Vienne was the scene of a general\r\nCouncil of the Church at which the Templars were suppressed by a pope\r\ncowed into obedience by the king of France, who arrived at the Council\r\nwith an escort of the size of an army. The majority of the bishops\r\npresent held that to abolish the Order was not a legal act, since the\r\ncharges against them were unproven. Therefore, Clement V was forced to\r\nfall back on the expedient plea of solicitude for the public good.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1879; J. Ch. Roux, _Vienne_ (Paris, Bloud et\r\nCie, 1909); M. Reymond, _Grenoble, Vienne_ (Collection, Villes d'art\r\ncélèbres), (Paris, II. Laurens); Lucien Bégule, _L'ancienne cathédrale\r\nde Vienne-en-Dauphiné_ (Paris, II. Laurens, 1914); Paul Berret, _Le\r\nDauphiné_ (Collection, Provinces françaises), (Paris, II. Laurens).\r\n\r\n[162] About thirty miles to the north of Lyons lies Bourg-en-Bresse, in\r\nwhose suburbs is the church of Brou. The eighteen windows of the school\r\nof Lyons were installed when the church was finished in 1536. Marguerite\r\nof Austria built it in fulfillment of a vow of her mother-in-law, a\r\nBourbon princess, Marguerite herself being daughter of Mary of Burgundy,\r\na line, like the Bourbous, that gloried in sumptuous mausoleums. She\r\nintrusted the work to the Lyons master, Jean Perréal, who called on his\r\naged friend, Michel Colombe, for the imagery of the tombs. Colombe\r\ndesigned Duke Philibert's _gisant_ and the six winged genii, executed\r\nlater, with liberties, by Conrad Meyt, and his brother (artists trained\r\nat Lyons), and some Italians. Disagreements rose, and Perréal was\r\nsuperseded by Loys van Boghem, who erected a bastard Gothic church of\r\nthe same heavy Flemish type popular then at Toledo and Burgos. The three\r\nrich overcharged tombs are in the choir. Marguerite almost became the\r\nwife of Charles VIII, late-Gothic builder, and for a short time was\r\nmarried to the only son of Isabelle and Ferdinand, whose tomb is a boast\r\nof Avila. When the early death of the Duke of Savoy left her a widow she\r\ngoverned the Netherlands for her nephew, the Emperor Charles V. Her\r\nfather's tomb at Innsbruck is one of the noted ones of the world, and\r\nthe heraldic tombs of her mother and her grandfather (Charles le\r\nTéméraire of Burgundy) are in Bruges.\r\n\r\nIf the traveler hopes to find flat, suburban Brou as described by\r\nMatthew Arnold, \"mid the Savoy mountain valleys, far from town or haunt\r\nof man,\" he will be disappointed.

The present choir of Moulins Cathedral, originally the\r\nchapel of their palace, was begun by Agnes of Burgundy, daughter of Jean\r\nsans Peur, and finished by her sons, Jean II de Bourbon and Pierre II\r\nsire de Beaujeu, who in 1475 wedded the daughter of Louis XI and\r\ngoverned France with his wife during the minority of Charles VIII.\r\nJeanne of France and her husband are portrayed on the folding doors of\r\nthe splendid triptych (1488-1503), by some unknown French _primitif_ now\r\nin the sacristy of Moulins Cathedral, and again in one of the three\r\nwindows--warm in color and with fine, clear portrait work--in the square\r\neast wall of the chevet, glass that belongs to the transition from\r\nGothic to Renaissance as the XV century merged in the XVI.\r\nFifteenth-century windows are comparatively rare, so the twelve\r\npossessed by Moulins' chief church are precious. Cardinal Charles de\r\nBourbon, who beautified Lyons Cathedral, also appears in the Bourbon\r\ndukes' window with his two brothers. The nave of Moulins Cathedral, in\r\nblack-and-white Volvic stone, is a modern rendering by Lassus and Millet\r\nof the Primary Gothic of the region.\r\n\r\nSouvigny was a Cluniac priory, in which died the two great Cluny abbots,\r\nSt. Majolus (d. 994), who brought to France the noted William of\r\nVolpiano, the organizer of the Romanesque renaissance of architecture,\r\nand St. Odilo (d. 1049). In 1095 Urban II stayed in Souvigny, and so did\r\nPaschal II in 1106. The XII-century church was largely reconstructed in\r\nthe late-Gothic day when the prior Dom Geoffrey Chollet wished to house\r\nfittingly the splendid new Bourbon tombs. That of Louis II (comrade in\r\narms of Dugueselin) has been attributed without proof to Jean de\r\nCambrai, who made the Berry tomb at Bourges. M. Guigue has ably assigned\r\nto Jacques Morel the tomb of Charles I and Agnes of Burgundy. The\r\nBourbon line, direct in descent from St. Louis, mounted the French\r\nthrone with Henry IV.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1913, p. 1, Chanoine Joseph Clémat; p. 182,\r\nDoshoulières; J.

At the beginning of the XIII century that\r\ntransept was vaulted in the eight-rib Plantagenet way, the keystones\r\nbeing well carved. The ambulatory and radiating chapels are\r\nearly-Gothic; the choir is late XIII century; the easternmost bays of\r\nthe nave are of the XIV, and its westernmost bays of the XV century. The\r\nfaçade is a gem of Flamboyant Gothic. There are also windows of the XIII\r\nand XV centuries, and some well-known carved choir stalls. The Merveille\r\nof Vendôme, its tower of 1140, prototype for the Primary Gothic ones at\r\nChartres and Rouen, stands free of the church. From the earlier abbatial\r\nwas saved a famous XII-century window of the St. Denis school, a\r\nByzantinesque Madonna.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1872; Abbé Plat, _Notes pour servir à\r\nl'histoire monumental de la Trinité_ (Vendôme, 1907); La Martellière,\r\n_Guide dans le Vendômois_ (Vendôme, 1883).\r\n\r\n[166] W.

When the church was\r\nrebuilt after a fire in 1180, big Plantagenet Gothic vaults, each\r\nsection with eight ribs, were flung over the wide nave, which originally\r\nhad possessed side aisles. Vestiges of a Carolingian church, built a\r\ndecade before 1000, are in the crypt and the lower walls of choir and\r\ntransept, where alternance of stone and brick work appears. The chevet\r\nis the oldest example now extant of an ambulatory and radiating chapel.\r\nIn the XII century the upper choir was rebuilt, and again it was\r\nretouched during the XIII and XV centuries. The façade and the\r\nwell-sculptured portal are late XIII century. A charming XVI-century\r\nVirgin, by Germain Pilon, on a pier opposite the pulpit, is to be\r\nclassed with the prolongation of the Region-of-the-Loire school of\r\nsculpture whose center was Tours. Across the Sarthe lies the other\r\nBenedictine church, the former St. Julien-du-Pré, a Romanesque edifice\r\nof the XI and XII centuries, revaulted in the Flamboyant Gothic day.\r\n\r\n[168] \"O noble peuple d'artisans!

The saint was linked with the new\r\nsystem of building. For the king of Hungary, Villard de Honnecourt built\r\nKassovic church. Her aunt was the gentle Agnes of Méran, married to\r\nPhilippe-Auguste. Her half sister, Yolande, wedded that other builder of\r\nchurches, Jaime el Conquistador, from whom sprang Yolande of Aragon,\r\nKing René's mother, also a builder. St. Elizabeth's niece, daughter of\r\nthe king of Hungary, married Charles II d'Anjou, who began the best\r\nGothic church in Provence, at St. Maximin.\r\n\r\n[171] Amédée Boinet, _Verdun et St. Mihiel_ (Collection, Petites\r\nMonographies), (Paris, H.

In\r\nthe venerable XII-century church of St. Eutrope cropped out one of the\r\nearly sporadic uses of diagonals. Its crypt, which is one of the largest\r\nin France, is braced on heavy, semicircular arches. The exterior of the\r\napse is decorated. Nothing is left of the original nave; the present one\r\nis transitional work. The choir and part of the transept are of the XV\r\ncentury. The superb tower, with corner-turret effects that rise from\r\nbase to summit, was finished with a spire by 1480. It is said that John\r\nXXII, who promulgated the Angelus by his bull of 1318, had learned its\r\nusage from a custom of St. Eutrope. The church of St. Pierre, at\r\nSaintes, rebuilt in 1117, and again in 1450, has another Flamboyant\r\nGothic tower of good design, which is now much wasted by decay.

The ancient frescoes are full of interest.\r\nAt the north end of the transept is a now unused portal, whose sculpture\r\nbelongs to the same Midi school as Moissac, but later and calmer work.\r\nThe Christ of its tympanum is classed with Vézelay, Chartres, and\r\nBeaulieu--the supreme Christ images of Romanesque art. M. Forel praises\r\nthe angels' magnificent gesture of adoration. The XIV-century west front\r\nresembles those of the Brunswick churches whose façade and towers\r\ncomprise one massive up to the roof. John XXII (1316-33), the second\r\nAvignon pope, was born in Cahors, where he founded the university,\r\ncontributed toward the cathedral, and built a bridge over the Lot which\r\nis considered the handsomest of the Middle Ages.

Close\r\nto it is Fléae, whose three cupolas have no separate bases, but are\r\npierced directly by the big arcades, which is more the Byzantine way of\r\nmaking a cupola than the French. Six miles from Angoulême are the ruins\r\nof La Couronne abbatial, where once was a Plantagenet Gothic choir; and\r\nten miles away, at Roullet, is a remarkable sculptured façade. Aulnay's\r\nfine church has a decorated front, well-cut capitals, and a ribbed\r\ncupola, without distinct pedestal. Pont l'Abbé possesses one of the best\r\nRomanesque façades in France. At Ruffec and at Civray are others. There\r\nis a church at Charroux with the curious plan of three aisles round a\r\ncentral octagon. Cupola churches are to be found at Plazzac, Bassac,\r\nGensae, Cognac, Souillae, and Solignac, six miles from Limoges. Studies\r\nof these churches by E. Lefèvre-Pontalis, L.

He held Vendôme, Amboise, and\r\nLoches, where he founded Beaulieu Abbey, and he won Chinon, and Saumur,\r\nwhere he established St. Florent-les-Saumur. His grandfather, Fulk II\r\nthe Good, a canon in St. Martin's at Tours, and a poet, had said, \"_Rex\r\nilliteratus est asinus coronatus_,\" which Henry I of England was fond of\r\nrepeating. The son of Fulk Nerra was Geoffrey Martel (d. 1060), who won\r\nTours and Le Mans, but later lost the overlordship of the latter to\r\nWilliam the Conqueror. He founded the Trinité at Vendôme. Geoffrey and\r\nFulk, his two nephews, succeeded in turn, but Geoffrey was kept\r\nimprisoned in Chinon for almost thirty years by his unnatural brother\r\nFulk Rechin, or the Quarreler, who had all the greed, subtlety, and\r\nturbulance of his line, without its genius for statesmanship. He is\r\ncounted as the first historian of the Middle Ages. (See _Hist. littér.\r\nde la France_ (Paris, 1750), vol. 9, p. 391.) Fulk Rechin's son by the\r\nbeautiful Bertrada de Montfort (who deserted him for the king of France)\r\nwas Fulk V, who wedded the heiress of Maine. When later Fulk V won a\r\nsecond heiress in the East, he left Anjou and Maine to his son Geoffrey\r\nthe Handsome, and reigned as king of Jerusalem (d. 1143). Geoffrey (d.\r\n1151), nicknamed Plantagenet, married to the heiress of Normandy and\r\nEngland, always preferred Le Mans to Angers. His son became Henry II of\r\nEngland and a leader in Europe because of his territorial possessions on\r\nthe Continent and his ability as a statesman.\r\n\r\n[187] The abbatial of St. Nicolas-du-Ronceray is in a lamentable state;\r\nits nave serves as a hall for the Arts and Crafts school, the transept's\r\nnorth arm is a laundry, and its south arm a roofless ruin. The dome at\r\nits crossing is without distinct pedestal. The nuns of this house\r\nerected at the side of their own sanctuary, the Trinité church for\r\nparish use. The present admirable Trinité was built after a fire in\r\n1062. Its chevet and transept are the oldest parts, and then rose the\r\nnave, covered with First-Period Angevin vaults (c. 1170). Chapel-like\r\nniches are lost in the thickness of the walls.\r\n\r\nAngers' abbatial of St. Martin contains Gallo-Roman, Merovingian, and\r\nCarolingian vestiges, and parts of the XI, XII, and XV centuries. Fulk\r\nNerra rebuilt it on returning from one of his pilgrimages. Over its\r\ntransept-crossing is a dome modeled on the one at Fontevrault, without\r\nseparate pedestal. The church possesses one of the earliest eight-branch\r\nGothic vaults extant; King René added the Flamboyant parts. Chanoine\r\nPinier at his own expense is restoring the choir and transept.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1910, vol. 1, p. 211, \"St. Martin,\" Chanoine\r\nPinier; and vol. 2, p. 12, \"St. Nicolas-du-Ronceray,\" E.\r\nLefèvre-Pontalis.\r\n\r\n[188] Bishop Ulger carried forward, too, the episcopal palace which\r\nstood on V-century walls over the Roman citadel and is connected with\r\nthe cathedral's transept. Its ancient façade is the finest civic\r\nmonument in Angers (1101-49). The ground floor was used as a stable;\r\nover it rose Bishop Ulger's synodal hall, and under the rafters was made\r\na library in the XV century. Angers is exceptionally rich in late-Gothic\r\nand Renaissance mansions. G. d'Espinay, _Angers et l'Anjou_ (Angers,\r\n1903); _ibid._, _Notices archéol., Les monuments d'Angers, Saumur et ses\r\nenvirons_ (Angers, 1875), 2 vols.\r\n\r\n[189] The first line of Anjou's counts came to an end when John Lackland\r\ndid away with his nephew, Arthur of Brittany. The region of the Loire\r\nbecame then most willingly a part of Phillipe-Auguste's royal domain.\r\nAnjou was given as an appanage to St. Louis' brother Charles d'Anjou,\r\nwhose first wife brought him Provence, and who by invitation and\r\nconquest became king of the Two Sicilies. His son, Charles II, built the\r\nchurch of St. Maximin in Provence. He left only one daughter, who\r\nmarried the Count of Valois, like herself of St. Louis' direct line. The\r\nson of that union mounted the French throne as Philip VI. It was his\r\nson, Jean le Bon, who again detached Anjou from the French crown for his\r\nson Louis, who began the short-lived third line of Angevin princes.\r\n\r\n[190] That a portion of Angers' palace walls dates from Gallo-Roman\r\ntimes is indicated by the courses of brick in the small stones. When\r\nsuch brick courses alternate with big material, the work was done after\r\n1000. Of the red flint-stone castle built by Fulk Nerra only fragments\r\nremain. A fire in 1132 and later disasters wiped out the counts'\r\nresidence, to which Henry Plantagenet had added.

Havard, éd., _La France\r\nartistique et monumental_, vol. 2, \"Angers,\" H. Jouin.\r\n\r\n[191] The nave of St. Serge is a mediocre XV-century structure. In its\r\ntransept walls are vestiges of earlier churches; the cordons of brick in\r\nthe stonework date from Carolingian times. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1871\r\nand 1910; V.

It has\r\nnoticeable capitals, mural paintings, and Plantagenet vaults with\r\nsculptured keystones and figurines. Two miles below it lies Gennes,\r\nwhose church has Angevin vaults of the First Period. To be reached,\r\n_via_ Doué-la-Fontaine, are both Puy-Notre-Dame and Asnières, the latter\r\ncalled \"the most beautiful ruin in Anjou.\" Its square-ended XIII-century\r\nchoir resembles St. Serge's. Slender pillars divide that wide chevet\r\ninto three aisles of equal height, composing one of the most graceful\r\nspecimens of the school's Third Period. One arm of the transept has\r\nheavy diagonals of the first phase, and over the other are the\r\neight-branch type. The Huguenots wrecked Asnières in 1569. The present\r\nnave is a restitution. A society of artists saved the choir and transept\r\nfrom demolition.\r\n\r\nThe abbatial of Puy-Notre-Dame is very beautiful. Heavy diagonals of the\r\nFirst Period cover the transept's south arm; eight-branch vaults cover\r\nthe nave and the transept's north limb; over the choir, which resembles\r\nSt. Jean's chevet at Saumur, is a much-ramified Plantagenet vault. The\r\nlofty side aisles and clustered piers make this interior one of the best\r\nof XIII-century Angevin works extant. At St. Germain-sur-Vienne\r\n(Indre-et-Loire), two miles from Candes, the choir has the complicated\r\nmultiple-ribbed vault of the Third Period, with three lines of\r\nkeystones.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1910, p. 128, Cunault and Gennes; p. 65,\r\nPuy-Notre-Dame and Asnières; E. de Lorière, \"Asnières-sur-Vègre,\" in\r\n_Revue hist. et archéol. du Maine_, 1904, p. 95.\r\n\r\n[194] At the battle of Jargeau, Jeanne reminded the duke of her promise.\r\nD'Alençon himself has related the episode: \"_Je lui fis observer que\r\nc'était aller bien vite en besogne que d'attaquer si promptement: 'Soyez\r\nsans crainte,' me dit-elle, 'l'heure est bonne quand il plaît à Dieu, il\r\nfaut besoigner quand s'est sa volonté: agissez, Dieu agira! Ah, gentil\r\nduc,' me dit-elle quelques instants après, 'aurais-tu peur? Ne sait-tu\r\npas que j'ai promis à ta femme de te ramener sain et sauf?'_\" Alas, for\r\nthe deterioration of character brought about in those troubled years of\r\nforeign invasion and misrule; Jeanne's _gentil duc_ was later to plot\r\nwith the English and to be impeached.\r\n\r\nAt Chinon are specimens of Plantagenet Gothic (_Bulletin Monumental_,\r\n1869). In the Loire-et-Cher department are some fourteen churches of the\r\nschool. The other Plantagenet monuments usually seen by the traveler\r\nbefore his arrival in Angou are the eight-branch vaults at Vendôme, in\r\nthe transept of the Trinité; the vault under the northwest tower of\r\nTours Cathedral; and in Le Mans, the cathedral nave and the church of\r\nthe Couture. At Mouliherne (Seine-et-Loire) every type of the\r\nPlantagenet development is present.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1910, vol. 1, p. 130, \"St. Florent-les-Saumur,\"\r\nAndré Rhein; vol. 2, \"Les voûtes de l'église de Mouliherne,\" André\r\nRhein; p. 247, \"Les influences angevines sur les églises gothiques du\r\nBlésois et du Vendômois,\" F.

It has also been incorporated in the Roman Breviary for feasts\r\nof the Holy Cross. There have been a host of translations. In his\r\n_Medieval Hymns and Sequences_, London, 1813, Dr. J. M. Neale thus\r\nrendered the first quatrain:\r\n\r\n    \"The royal banners forward go.\r\n     The cross shines forth with mystic glow,\r\n     Where He in flesh, our flesh Who made,\r\n     Our sentence bore, our ransom paid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[198] Montierneuf was founded in 1078 by Guillaume VIII (d. 1086). Only\r\neight of the nave's eleven bays remain. The chevet was rebuilt in the\r\nXIV century. The abbey was sacked in 1562. St. Porchaire's tower is all\r\nthat remains of an XI-century church, a contemporary of Notre\r\nDame-la-Grande and Montierneuf. It was to be destroyed in 1843, but\r\nluckily some visiting archæologists saved it. From St. Porchaire's\r\nbelfry rang the summonses of Poitiers University.

Its choir and transept\r\nbelong to the early part of the XII century, and its nave was erected\r\nabout thirty years after. Its donjonlike tower was crowned later by a\r\nspire, the highest in southwest France with St. Michel's at Bordeaux.\r\nLike Etruscan vase ornamentation are its unique frescoes giving Genesis,\r\nExodus, and the Apocalypse. On the route from Poitiers to St. Savin lies\r\nChauvigny, \"the pearl of Poitou,\" with the ruins of several castles. Its\r\nchurch of St. Pierre has a decorated apse and some eight-branch\r\nPlantagenet vaults; its church of Notre Dame possesses some XV-century\r\nfrescoes.\r\n\r\nAnother of the chief Poitou-Romanesque churches is at St. Maixent,\r\nthirty miles from Poitiers, _via_ Niort. The nave is XII century, the\r\nchoir, Angevin Gothic, and the tower, Flamboyant; its crypt capitals are\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\nThe abbey church at St. Jouin-de-Marnes, near Montcontour, has a good\r\nfaçade, a fine Romanesque tower, a transept of the end of the XI\r\ncentury, and a XII-century choir and nave, only three of whose vault\r\nsections, however, are the primitive ones. In the XIII century the\r\npresent elaborate masonry roof was substituted. It belongs to the Third\r\nPeriod of the Plantagenet school, with three lines of keystones.\r\nAirvault abbey church, not far away, built a similar much-ramified\r\nvault, the prototype for that of Toussaint, at Angers.\r\n\r\nParthenay can be included in the trip from Poitiers to St.\r\nJouin-de-Marnes. In its venerable church took place the scene when St.\r\nBernard rose in majesty at the altar and compelled the giant sinner\r\nGuillaume X of Aquitaine to repent.\r\n\r\nThree miles from Poitiers lies St. Benoit's Romanesque church, with a\r\nXIII-century spire, and five miles away is Ligugé, where St. Martin,\r\nunder St. Hilary's guidance, founded the first monastery in Gaul. Dom\r\nProsper Guéranger restored Ligugé in 1864, and here J. K. Huysmans\r\nlived, as he has described in _l'Oblat_. The XV-century church was\r\nrebuilt by that prelate of the Renaissance, Geoffrey d'Estissac, whom\r\nRabelais came to visit.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1910, St. Savin; p. 119, Airvault; p. 108, St.\r\nJouin-de-Marnes, and the latter also in the _Congrès_ of 1903; Prosper\r\nMerimée, _Les peintures de St. Savin_ (Paris, 1845), folio; Ch.\r\nTranchant, _Guide pour la visite des monuments de Chauvigny en Poitou_\r\n(Paris, 1901).\r\n\r\n[200] Probably because of the magistral window at Poitiers, the\r\nByzantine tradition of the crucified Christ lingered long in the art of\r\nmidland France. Over an altar of the chapel of Bourgonnière, in the\r\nparish of Bouzillé, in Angers diocese, is a remarkable XVI-century\r\npolychrome image of the Saviour, unwounded, robed, and awake, with arms\r\nwide outstretched against the Cross.\r\n\r\n[201] In 1106 gathered another council at Poitiers, a holy-war rally,\r\nbut the war was to be waged on Christian Constantinople. The superb\r\nBohemund, the new prince of Antioch, came to organize the expedition; he\r\nhad gone on the First Crusade for booty, fierce as a Norman, astute as\r\nan Italian, in person like a Greek god, tall beyond man's normal height,\r\nbroad-shouldered, and lithe--so the Greek princess at Constantinople saw\r\nhim. Philip I gave him his daughter, and on Tancred, his cousin, a true\r\nhero of the holy wars, not a buccaneer, the king of France bestowed his\r\ndaughter by the fair Bertrada de Montfort.\r\n\r\n[202] E.

The proud,\r\nfull chin is uplifted. The shapely back is molded by a leopard's skin.\r\nThe right arm is missing, but the left arm is honey-hued and as delicate\r\nas flesh in appearance.

Tantôt silhouettée par de vigoureux\r\néclairages, tantôt estompée par les vapeurs qui planent dans la vallée,\r\net quelquefois, aux heures matinales émergeant de leur nappe grise,\r\ncomme une haute mâture au-dessus de la mer tranquille, elle reste\r\ntoujours fière, imposante, poétique.\"--LOUIS GONSE, _L'art gothique_\r\n(Paris, 1891).\r\n\r\n[208] The Chaise Dieu monastery, founded by St. Robert in 1043, was\r\nlater affiliated with Cluny. The present church was begun in 1344 by\r\nClement VI, who built the choir and four bays of the nave. The abbatial\r\nwas completed, after 1370, by his nephew, Gregory XI. Clement had\r\nAvignon artists prepare his funeral monument, which originally possessed\r\nover forty statuettes representing his relatives, for he came of the\r\ngreat lines of Beaufort and Turenne. The Casa Dei abbatial, though\r\npossessed of grandeur, is dull and heavy. The aisles are as high as the\r\nprincipal span. The octagonal piers with uncut capitals lack elegance\r\nand lightness, the windows are the narrowest lancets, and there are no\r\nflying buttresses. Molds die away in the piers above the capitals--an\r\nearly appearance of Flamboyant Gothic. The cloister (1378-1417) is\r\nfrankly late-Gothic. The denuded church once was filled with the tombs\r\nof local magnates, among them those of the Lafayette family, precious\r\npages of French history obliterated in 1562 and 1793. As if to shut out\r\nthe funereal, humid aisles, the choir has been lined with tapestries\r\n(begun in 1492) unsurpassed in France. They reproduce the _Mirror of\r\nPerfection_ and the _Bible of the Poor_, two books popular in the XIII\r\nand XIV centuries. Each episode of the Saviour's life is accompanied by\r\nscenes of the Old Testament, prefiguring it. On the outer wall of the\r\nchoir screen is a sketch, a Dance of Death, with the grim skeleton\r\nstalking in and out, touching with his chill finger pope, baron,\r\nburgher, page, field laborer, and little child. No XIII-century church\r\nhad allowed so gruesome a theme on its walls. This lugubrious allegory\r\ncame into vogue after the Black Death of 1348, when a third of Europe's\r\npopulation perished. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1904, pp. 54, 402; E.\r\nDurand, _La Chaise Dieu_ (1903); Maurice Fançon, _L'église abbatiale de\r\nla Chaise Dieu en Auvergne_; Émile Mâle, _L'art religieux de la fin du\r\nmoyen âge_ (Paris, Colin, 1910).\r\n\r\n[209] \"Quiconque en a senti une fois la beauté forte et simple de ce\r\nvigoureux style roman-auvergnat, dont l'origine demeure mystérieuse,\r\nn'oublie plus ces églises, solides, trapues, ramassées, dont\r\nl'ordonnance extérieure, au lieu d'être un décor plaqué, reproduit en\r\nrelief l'ordonnance intérieure.

This\r\nlatter is one of the most beautiful of XII-century churches, showing\r\nBurgundian traits as well as those of Auvergne and the Velay. The\r\ninfluence of the Romanesque school of Auvergne spread to Parthenay,\r\nSaintes, Nevers, Toulouse, Santiago, and Avila. _Congrès Archéologique_,\r\n1904, p. 542, E.

The choir is of that century; the nave was finished\r\nabout 1335, and some of its sculptures, showing the national crest with\r\nthe arms of both England and France, recall the short sovereignty in\r\nFrance of Henry V and Henry VI. The cloister of Bayonne ranks with those\r\nof Elne and Arles. A transept is indicated merely by the spacing of\r\nbays. The XII-century tower was rebuilt from 1501 to 1544. The interior\r\nof the cathedral is more firm than it is graceful, owing to the piers\r\nbeing six feet square and to an excessive sobriety in ornamentation.\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1888.\r\n\r\n[222] Léon Gautier, éd., _Chanson de Roland_ (Tours, Mâme, 1895),\r\nsection 297, l. 3684.\r\n\r\n[223] _Congrès Archéologique_, 1874 and 1906; H.

Their date is certain,\r\n1324 to 1348, yet their realism is of the XV century. Again Languedoc\r\nproved precocious in sculpture. In the Museum is a XIV-century statue of\r\nBishop Guillaume Durandus, author of _Rationale_.\r\n\r\n[227] When Moissac was affiliated with Cluny and reformed, its church\r\nwas rebuilt by Abbot Durand, whose image adorns a pier of the cloister's\r\neast gallery. The walls of the nave belong to the edifice consecrated in\r\n1063. That church of three aisles was remade with cupolas and blessed in\r\n1180, and of the same date are the fortified narthex and its tower.\r\nOwing to those defenses the celebrated portal is in the south wall of\r\nthe porch, not in the church axis. The Gothic ribs beneath the tower are\r\nrectangular and three feet wide. In the XIV century the cupolas were\r\nreplaced by diagonals. The cloisters were begun about 1100 under Abbot\r\nAnsquitil, who made the pier images, also the marble parts of the\r\nportal, its trumeau, and the Visitation. Abbot Roger (1115-31) finished\r\nthe cloisters, inscribing the carved Scripture scenes of the capitals.\r\nDuring the first quarter of the XII century Moissac's imagery passed\r\nfrom the squat, coarsely executed figures of the cloister piers to the\r\nappealing, etherealized types--\"_fluides créations du Languedoc_\"--the\r\nAnnunciation group. Mr. A. Kingsley Porter thinks that door-jamb-figure\r\nsculpture was first used by Guglielmo at Modena Cathedral (c. 1100), and\r\nfrom Italy passed into southern France. The current of art flowed in the\r\nopposite direction, too, for the coupled colonnettes, typical of the\r\nRomanesque cloisters of Provence, Languedoc, and Spain, soon found their\r\nway across the Alps, where early examples are to be seen at Verona and\r\nAosta, and at the cathedral door of Verona are Languedoc's elongated\r\nfigures with crossed feet. The _Portico de la gloria_ at Santiago sets\r\nforth the vision of John the Beloved at Patmos quite as Moissac's\r\ntympanum presents it. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1901, vol. 2, pp. 43,\r\n303; E.

It is quite devoid of capitals. The façade is neo-classic. The\r\nchoir stalls (1520-29) are masterpieces; Italianate fawns and Bacchantes\r\nare placed beside sacred personages. The magnificent windows, of the\r\ntransition between Flamboyant Gothic and Renaissance, were the work of\r\nArnaud de Moles (1507-13); their portrait studies are like Holbein's\r\npictures.

The Romanesque cathedral at Rodez was supplanted by\r\nthe present one in 1277. The works flagged, however, and the nave was\r\nbuilt as late-Gothic by Bishop Guillaume de la Tour d'Oliergues and a\r\nnephew who succeeded him. The west façade was left bare, since there the\r\nchurch overlooked the ramparts; to it were added later a rose window and\r\na Flamboyant gallery.

M. Lefèvre-Pontalis devotes a study to St. Paul\r\nSerge (p. 345), whose choir was built from 1229 to 1244. In the transept\r\nare vestiges of the primitive church. Two bays of the nave are of the\r\nXIV century, and the others are XII-century work redone in the XIII. To\r\nbind together the bulging walls, flat arches were thrown over the\r\ncentral vessel at the level of the pier arches. The church presents such\r\npeculiarities in the Midi as circulation passages at different levels\r\nround the edifice. There are false tribune arches, and over the pier\r\narcade a passageway is maneuvered. Sergius Paulus was the first to\r\npreach Christianity in the city. In Narbonne's valuable Museum are\r\nclassic vestiges of the city's great day under the Roman Empire. Many of\r\nthe classic marble columns are to-day in the mosque at Cordova. Ch. E.\r\nSchmidt, _Cordoue, Grenade_ (Collection, Villes d'art célèbres), (Paris,\r\nH. Laurens).\r\n\r\n[240] The Cistercian abbey of Fontfroide lies in a wild gorge some six\r\nmiles from Narbonne. The church, begun in the middle of the XII century,\r\nwas roofed with a pointed cradle vault. The cloister, like that at\r\nTarragona, was covered with _bombé_ vaults on eight ribs. Little marble\r\ncolumns support the Gothic masonry roof of the chapter house, which,\r\nlike Poblet's, opens by arcades on the cloister. Twelve monks from\r\nFontfroide founded Poblet in 1150. The countess who ruled Narbonne for\r\nsixty years confirmed the abbey charter in 1157: \" I, Ermengarde, give\r\nto God and the Blessed Mary, to Abbot Vital and the present and future\r\nservants of God, the lands of Fontfroide,\" runs her deed of gift. Doubly\r\nis a nation robbed when monastic lands are held by private individuals\r\nwho assume no responsibility toward the public, as did a majority of the\r\nancient houses, before royalty named its favorites as their abbots. Even\r\nas vast tracts were granted to nobles that they might perform gratis the\r\nmilitary defense of a land, so monasteries were expected to give payment\r\nfor their domains, by voluntary services to civilization.

The transept ends are apsidal below and pentagonal\r\nabove. Beside it stands an older St. Jean, dedicated in 1025. The see\r\noriginally was at Elne, where the cathedral was rebuilt in the XI\r\ncentury; lotus leaves are carved on the capitals of its lovely marble\r\ncloister (c. 1175). _Congrès Archéologique_, 1868; and 1906, p. 109,\r\nPerpignan; p. 135, Elne; E. de Barthélemy, \" Le cloître de la ville\r\nd'Elne,\" in _Bulletin Monumental_, 1857, vol. 23; Bernard Palustre,\"\r\nPerpignan et ses monuments,\" in _Revue d'hist. et d'archéol du\r\nRoussillon_, 1905; Auguste Brutails, \" Notes sur l'art religieux du\r\nRoussillon,\" in _Bulletin archéol. du comité des traveaux hist. et\r\nscientifique_, 1892, No. 4; 1893, No. 3; P.

Ambrogio at Milan. Lombard\r\ntowers, arched corbel tables, and mural arcaded bands passed from\r\nnorthern Italy into Languedoc. The early intersecting ribs here were\r\nexceptional for the Midi in being profiled. The nave and aisles are of\r\nthe first half of the XI century, the chevet and transept of the early\r\nXII, as is the cloister, which once had a second story. The narthex was\r\nbuilt from 1165 to 1199. The first duke of Aquitaine, Aliénor's\r\nancestor, died here, a monk. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1906, p. 384;\r\n\"L'église abbatiale de St. Guilhem-le-Désert,\" Émile Bonnet; Joseph\r\nBédier, _Les légendes épiques_, vol. 1, \"St. Guillaume de Gellone\"\r\n(Paris, H.

Leo XIII, in the encyclical _Immortale\r\nDei_, November, 1885, set aside that claim. Each should keep to its own\r\nsphere, he said, one is not subordinate to the other; civil authorities\r\nare to attend to human affairs, and spiritual authorities to divine\r\nthings. With every monarch in Europe appealing to him for his\r\narbitration, it is little wonder that Innocent III should have held the\r\nviews he did.\r\n\r\n[246] Mende lies in the mountains of western Languedoc. Its cathedral\r\nwas begun (1365) under the auspices of Urban V, whose statue stands in\r\nthe square close by. Practically it is a XV-century church, without\r\ncapitals, flying buttresses, or transept. During twelve years the\r\narchitect was Pierre Juglar, an associate, at Riom, of those Flamboyant\r\nGothic masters, the Dammartin brothers. The cathedral was finished with\r\nits two towers in 1512. From 1286 to 1296 the bishop of Mende was\r\nGuillaume Durandus, author of _Rationale_, the famous book on church\r\nsymbolism. He was governor under the popes of the marches of Ancona and\r\nthe Romagna, and led the papal forces in battle. The Italian city of\r\nCastel Duranti was named after him. When he died at Rome in 1296,\r\nGiovanni Cosmati made his tomb, a masterpiece in the only Gothic church\r\nof Rome, Santa-Maria-sopra-Minerva. Urban V was generous also to St.\r\nFlour (which lies south of Mende), whose abbatial was rebuilt in the XIV\r\ncentury; John XXII had raised it to cathedral rank in 1317. _Congrès\r\nArchéologique_, 1857, Mende.\r\n\r\n[247] Nothing now at St. Victor's, Marseilles, is earlier than the XI\r\ncentury. A pre-Gothic use of diagonal ribs (with Lombard rectangular\r\nprofiles) cropped out here, yet when the upper church was remodeled in\r\nthe XIII century, Romanesque vaulting was used. Urban V rebuilt the\r\ntransept, made the square apse, and raised the battlemented towers. When\r\nhe visited Marseilles in 1373 every man in the city ceased his work to\r\nwelcome him. As it was his desire to be buried in his former abbey, his\r\nremains were brought hither in 1372, and his successor, Gregory XI,\r\nraised a sumptuous Gothic monument forty feet in height.

The crenelated fortress-church replaced, in the XII century, one\r\ndestroyed by Saracens. Its eastern end rises in three stories; below, in\r\nthe crypt, is the shrine of Sara, the dark handmaiden; above is the high\r\naltar; and crowning all is the shrine (placed in St. Michael's care) in\r\nwhich Mary Jacobi and Mary Salome are honored. Their chapel opens on the\r\nchurch over the entrance to the Mass chapel. The sculpture resembles\r\nthat of St. Trophime, at Arles; perhaps the much-eroded marble lions\r\ncame from some monument of antiquity. Twice a year there are popular\r\npilgrimages to Les Saintes-Maries, that of May being frequented by the\r\ngypsies.

The church of St. Martha at\r\nTarascon was dedicated in 1197, but reconstructed in the XIV century.\r\nThe south portal, with its curious little gallery, is of the XIII\r\ncentury. The honored relics are in the crypt in a heavy tomb of 1650.\r\nThe simpler sarcophagus that once held them now stands by the side wall.\r\nAll over France the defeat of paganism by Christian bishop or saint was\r\nsymbolized by a dragon, and in the course of time the people often took\r\nthe symbol for reality. The legend of St. Martha's Tarasque, or dragon,\r\nmay be of this origin. Louis II d'Anjou began the castle of Tarascon,\r\nwhich was decorated by good King René. At Beaucaire, across the Rhone,\r\nis a tower built by St. Louis. The international fair of Beaucaire was\r\nfamous. \"Aucassin was of Beaucaire, of a goodly castle there\":\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis of Aucassin and Nicolette....\r\n     The song has charm, the tale has grace,\r\n     And courtesy and good address.\r\n     No man is in such distress,\r\n     Such suffering or weariness,\r\n     Sick with ever such sickness,\r\n     But he shall, if he hear this,\r\n     Recover all his happiness,\r\n                   So sweet it is!\"\r\n\r\nTurn to that cante-fable of the XIII century, and live again the Midi's\r\ndays of chivalry. Turn to that XIX-century masterpiece of satirical\r\ngenerous humor, _Tartarin de Tarascon_, more likely to survive than many\r\na more pretentious tale, so gay it is.\r\n\r\nF. W.

Nothing at Montmajour pre-dates A.D. 1000. In the monastery\r\nchurch appeared (in the transept) some early diagonals; the crypt\r\n(middle of the XII century) is of a peculiar plan: a circular chapel in\r\nthe middle of its apse with chapels radiating from the passage round it.\r\nFrom each arm of the transept projects an apse chapel. Under a hillock\r\nis a small shrine remade in the XIII century. In 1369 a tower of defense\r\nwas added to the abbey. The curious chapel of the Holy Cross, in a\r\nmeadow near by, is not of the time of its foundation, 1019, but a\r\nreconstruction of the XII century, probably intended for the chapel of a\r\ngraveyard. Montmajour once rose from the sea marshes that for centuries\r\ncame up to the gates of Arles. J. M.

St.\r\nColumbanus was born in Leinster in 543, the year that St. Benedict died\r\nat Monte Cassino. It is said that there was something supernatural in\r\nhis appearance. Because of his comeliness he embraced the monastic life\r\nto flee temptation, entering the abbey of Bangor, a center of letters in\r\nwhat is now Ulster. All his life Columbanus was a lover of the classics;\r\nfrom his library at Bobbio was recovered Cicero's _De Republica_. At\r\nthirty came the call to missionize in Gaul. Ireland, on the outer verge\r\nof Europe, had escaped the Barbarian's wrecking so that her culture was\r\nintact. With twelve monks, among them his nephew, St. Gall (future\r\nfounder of the noted Swiss abbey), Columbanus crossed to France. The\r\nking of Burgundy, a grandson of Clovis, gave him the region of Luxeuil,\r\nwhich the late invasions had turned into a desert. In twenty years\r\nColumbanus made it the center of spiritual life in Gaul. He was exiled\r\nin 610 because of his strictures on the evil living of Burgundy's\r\nrulers. After many wanderings he founded Bobbio, between Genoa and\r\nMilan, which abbey became another seat of learning. There he died in\r\n615.

Consoles,\r\nsculptured with heads, such as those under the lantern, are frequent in\r\nthe province, but a central tower is exceptional. In the XVIII century\r\nthe narthex was destroyed. St. Marcel's church was rebuilt after a fire\r\nin 1159 by the abbot of Cluny, who was a great-nephew of William the\r\nConqueror. The octagonal tower, capped by a XIII-century spire, is of\r\nexceptionally lovely proportions. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1913, p. 68.\r\nSt. Hugues also founded the Charité-sur-Loire, whose church was\r\ndedicated by his pupil. Paschal II, in 1107, at which ceremony assisted\r\nSuger, then a monk at St. Denis. Only the transept and absidioles are of\r\nthat time, for the choir, nave, and tower are Burgundian Romanesque of\r\nthe second half of the XII century; the Lady chapel rose two centuries\r\nlater.

The church was rebuilt early in the XII century, and\r\nof that period is the nave whose capitals present sculpture of different\r\nepochs: the barbaric earlier grotesques censured by St. Bernard, then a\r\nfew acanthus leaves and medallions, and, finally, naturalistic work.\r\nCalixtus II dedicated Saulieu's abbey church in 1119. In 1339 the\r\nEnglish sacked the choir and transept, which were rebuilt in 1704. That\r\ntrue son of Burgundy, Vauban, the celebrated engineer of Louis XIV, was\r\nborn in a château near Saulieu in 1633: \"The most honest man of his\r\ncentury, the simplest, truest, and bravest,\" according to St. Simon. He\r\ncovered France with defenses whose worth was proved in 1914. One can\r\ncomprehend qualities in a region's architecture by a knowledge of\r\nregional characters. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1907, p. 103, Pierre de\r\nTruchis, on Saulieu.

The present\r\nchurch is a typical Burgundian Gothic edifice, partly of the XII and\r\npartly of the XIII century. Carved corbels catch the fall of certain\r\ndiagonals, and in place of a triforium is an interior passageway that\r\npasses through the shafts. In the opening years of the XIV century was\r\nadded the narthex, a noble porch of two bays whose capitals have foliage\r\nin little bunches set in two rows. The façade is decorated by big\r\nstatues like that of the Madeleine church, a mile away, and at the\r\ncorners of the tower, a landmark for the valley, are sculptured angels\r\nblowing trumpets. The choir of St. Père-sous-Vézelay was wrecked during\r\nthe English wars, and was in large part rebuilt as late-Gothic. _Congrès\r\nArchéologique_, 1907, p. 16; Abbé Pissier, \"Notice historique sur\r\nSaint-Père-sous-Vézelay,\" in _Bull. de la Soc. des Sciences de l'Yonne_,\r\n1902, vol. 56, pp. 33, 275.\r\n\r\n[294] In his _Via Crucis_, F.

Beneath its sanctuary are two superimposed crypts, the lower one\r\nof the IX century, and that above it belonging to the XIII-century\r\nreconstruction of the abbey church. Conflagrations wiped out several\r\nearly churches of the monastery. In the XII century rose the Romanesque\r\ntower--one of the best in France; until 1820 it was attached to the\r\nnave. A total reconstruction of the abbatial was necessary in 1277, but\r\nafter the upper crypt and the choir were undertaken there came a pause.\r\nThe abbot here (1309-39), who erected the crenelated inclosure walls of\r\nthe monastery, resumed the church as Rayonnant Gothic. Urban V, the\r\ngreatest of the Avignon patrons of art and letters, had been abbot of\r\nSt. Germain (1352), and his arms were cut on a keystone of the new nave,\r\nto which he contributed, as did his successor, Gregory XI. Soon after\r\nthe church was completed it was pillaged during the religious wars.\r\nNapoleon turned the establishment into a hospital, which it still is.\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1907, p. 182, C.

Alors, j'avais fréquemment mes voix._\" Marius Sepet, _Au\r\ntemps de la Pucelle, récits et tableaux_ (Paris, P. Téqui, 1905).\r\n\r\n[300] The abbey church at St. Eusèbe is of archæological interest. The\r\noctagonal tower over its altar, forming internally a lantern, is of the\r\nXII century, as are the piers and their arches. A pause came between the\r\nmaking of the nave's lower and upper parts, for the church did not\r\nfollow the usual custom of advancing bay by bay, but was constructed\r\nstory by story. The west front is full Gothic, and the ambulatory of the\r\nXIII century. The original choir was in large part replaced by the\r\npresent well-built Flamboyant Gothic one, finished by 1530. What used to\r\nbe the episcopal palace of Auxerre is to-day the Prefecture. It shows,\r\nin its wall on the river side, the Romanesque gallery built by Bishop\r\nHugues de Châlons (1116-36). Its hall, with pignons alike at both ends,\r\nwas erected by Bishop Guillaume de Mello (1247-70). _Congrès\r\nArchéologique_, 1907, p. 188; Corberon, _Auxerre, ses monuments_;\r\nLescuyer, \"Notice sur l'église de St. Eusèbe,\" in _l'Annuaire de\r\nl'Yonne_, 1839, p. 318; 1845, p. 103, \"St. Eusèbe,\" Max Quantin.\r\n\r\n[301] The west apse of Nevers' Cathedral, dedicated to St. Juliette,\r\nmother of the child martyr, St. Cyr, formed, with its crypt and\r\ntransept, part of the XII-century Romanesque edifice. Late in the XIII\r\ncentury was built a Gothic nave, which was reconstructed after a fire in\r\n1308, and again its outer walls were reconstructed in the Flamboyant\r\nGothic day. The present choir dates from the XIV century. The fine tower\r\nat the transept's southern façade was built 1506 to 1528. Nevers' former\r\nducal palace, of the XV century, stands on a park overlooking the Loire.\r\nThe Romanesque abbey church of St. Étienne, founded, tradition says, by\r\nSt. Columbanus, combines the schools of Auvergne and Burgundy, and is\r\nimportant to archæologists because the date of its building, 1063 to\r\n1097, is certain. The expense of constructing it caused the Count of\r\nNevers to forego the First Crusade. Bishop Ives of Chartres consecrated\r\nthe church in 1097. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1913, p. 300, Louis Serbat;\r\nGaston Congny, _Bourges et Nevers_; J.

In the high windows of the cathedral of Auxerre\r\nthey first tried this method, and here the grisaille is chased with a\r\nlarge and firm design that offsets the transparency of the colorless\r\nsurfaces. Notice how the pedestal and the canopy, both very light, bind\r\ntogether the bands of grisaille on either side, while the latter is\r\nheavily painted with a trellis and rich ornaments. In Auxerre, the\r\ngrisaille is found only in the lateral windows which are seen obliquely.\r\nThe apse windows, meant to be seen, in face and from a distance, are\r\nfilled with color. The lateral windows are sufficiently opaque to\r\nprevent the solar rays which pass through them from lighting the colored\r\nwindows on the reverse side. At certain hours the luminous rays throw a\r\npearly light on the colored windows, imparting to them a transparency of\r\ntone and a delicacy impossible to describe. The opalescent light from\r\nthe lateral windows makes a sort of veil of extreme transparency under\r\nthe lofty vaults, and is pierced by the brilliant tones of the apse\r\nwindows, producing the sparkle of jewels. Solid outlines then seem to\r\nwaver like objects seen through a sheet of limpid water. Distance\r\nchanges values and gains a depth in which the eye loses itself.

Her\r\nfather was a president of Dijon's parliament. The sculptor Rude was a\r\nson of Dijon (d. 1855), and in this same city that had produced St.\r\nBernard and Bossuet, the most eloquent preacher of the XIX century,\r\nLacordaire, spent his childhood and youth, as his mother came of an old\r\nlegal family here.

From 946 to 980 the church was rebuilt, and\r\nagain from 1008 to 1028, under the auspices of William of Volpiano,\r\nabbot of St. Bénigne. On its outer walls are Lombard mural arcaded\r\nbands. The massive forechurch, or narthex of three bays, has two stories\r\nof different dates, the lower one about 950, and the upper about 980.\r\nThe vault of the latter--a cradle carried on brackets--is the earliest\r\nexample extant in France of a wide-span masonry roof at such a height.\r\nTournus exemplified the militant spirit of Burgundy's Romanesque school\r\nby experimenting with every kind of vault, cradle, half cradle,\r\ntransverse cradle, and groin. The pier arcades of the main church are of\r\nWilliam of Volpiano's time. The transept and choir are early XII\r\ncentury, and in that same period the reconstructed nave was covered by\r\nan experiment in stone roofing which never made a school; it had been\r\nused in Persia in the VI century. A series of half barrels borne on\r\nlintels were placed side by side across the wide nave, from north to\r\nsouth, instead of one long tunnel vault from east to west. The system\r\nallowed for the better lighting of the upper church, and as each barrel\r\nvault was buttressed by the one next it, only at the east and west ends\r\nof the edifice was abutment required. _Congrès Archéologique_, 1899, pp.\r\n223, 236; and 1909; Clement Heaton, in _Journal of the Royal Institute\r\nof British Architects_, 3d series, 1909.\r\n\r\n[308] Viollet-le-Duc, _Dictionnaire de l'Architecture_, vol. 4, pp.\r\n131-147; Huysmans, _L'Oblat_, chap. 5, on Notre Dame of Dijon. In his\r\nstory, which is the continuation of _En Route_ and _La Cathédrale_,\r\nHuysmans described the closing of the Burgundian monastery of Val des\r\nSaints near Dijon. His theory is that by such acts the balance of good\r\nand evil in the world is destroyed, since no longer is propitiatory\r\nself-sacrifice and prayer offered to heaven for the sins being committed\r\non earth: \"_Il faut s'attendre à ce que le Bon Dieu tombe sur nous ...\r\npour remettre les choses en place, et vous savez comment il procède,\r\ndans ces cas là, il vous accable d'infirmités et d'épreuves._\"\r\n\r\n[309] A clockmaker named Jacquemart made such works, hence their name.\r\nOriginally only one figure struck the hours on the big bell. Then a\r\nwife, Jacqueleine, was given to the bell-knocker, and after a local wit\r\nhad rallied the couple on their childless state, first one child,\r\nJacquelinet, was added, and then another, Jacquelinette, and the\r\nindustrious children now ring the quarter hours on the little bells.\r\n\r\n[310] Works of St. Bernard, edited by Mabillon (Paris, 1669-90), tr. by\r\nEales and Hodges (London, 1889), 4 vols.; E.

To-day the site is covered by an unfinished\r\ncommemorative church. The village church is of the XVI century.\r\n\r\n[312] As at Cîteaux, scarcely an ancient vestige remains at Clairvaux.\r\nThe XII-century monastic storehouse now serves as a house of detention.\r\nAll trace of St. Bernard's tomb has been lost. The Revolution finished\r\nwhat the Huguenot wars and the absentee commendatory abbots began.\r\n\r\n[313] M. Enlart calls Fossanuova, on the Appian Way between Rome and\r\nNaples, the first Gothic church in Italy, begun in 1187 by Burgundian\r\nCistercians. Mr. Porter thinks that the infiltration had begun thirty\r\nyears earlier through various channels. In 1208 Innocent III dedicated\r\nFossanuova; in 1274 St. Thomas Aquinas died there, en route to the\r\nCouncil at Lyons. The same plain Burgundian plan was followed at\r\nCasamari (1217), and a daughter house of the latter was S. Galgano\r\n(1218), from which went monks who are cited as the masters-of-works of\r\nSiena Cathedral, the best Gothic edifice of the peninsula. Monks from\r\nFrench Clairvaux built the three Chiaravalle churches of Italy, and\r\nmonks from Pontigny raised S. Martino near Viterbo. Later, Italy felt\r\nthe influence of different French schools; thus the Naples churches are\r\nGothic of Provence because southern French architects accompanied\r\nCharles d'Anjou, count of Provence, when he became king of the Two\r\nSicilies. At Assisi the church of S. Francesco shows the Gothic traits\r\nof Burgundy, Provence, and Champagne. The Cistercians introduced the\r\ntorus profile of diagonals, but they long clung to round-headed windows.\r\nThe Provence masters introduced pointed arched windows. In Spain,\r\nCîteaux found a rival in the monks of Cluny for the dissemination of the\r\nnew art. In the XII century a large number of Spanish bishoprics were\r\nfilled by Cluny monks. Sometimes they built according to their own\r\nnative architecture, as in Lugo Cathedral, San Vincente at Avila, and\r\nchurches in Seville, which are Burgundian Romanesque. Sigüenza Cathedral\r\nis Burgundian both in its Romanesque and Gothic parts. Zamora Cathedral,\r\nconsecrated 1174, and the old cathedral of Salamanca, show traits of\r\nAquitaine; both sees were occupied by Bishop Jerome, who came from\r\nPérigieux. The Cistercians of Spain did not confine themselves, as in\r\nItaly, to typically Burgundian Gothic churches. Poblet and Santa-Creus\r\n(1157) derive from the early Gothic of Midi France, as well as from\r\nBurgundy. Las Huelgas, the Cistercian house for nuns near Burgos,\r\nfinished about 1180, shows slight Burgundian and much Plantagenet Gothic\r\ninfluence. The foundress was the daughter of Henry II and Aliénor of\r\nAquitaine. In Spain, as in Italy, the later Gothic monuments conformed\r\nto the standards of northern French Gothic. Portugal was more\r\nexclusively a Cistercian field of art. In 1148, Alcobaça monastery was\r\nfounded by the son of a Burgundian prince, progenitor of Portugal's\r\nroyal line. While it shows Angevin Gothic traits, its plan is the sober\r\nCistercian Burgundian type. In the military Orders of Spain and Portugal\r\nthe Cistercian Rule was used. The king of Sweden, in 1143, obtained\r\nCistercian missionaries from Clairvaux; in Denmark the abbey church of\r\nSorö is Burgundian Gothic.

To the XIII century belong most of\r\nthe choir's piers and the apsidal chapels, also the beautiful chapter\r\nhouse. The transept then was put into harmony with the nave, and its\r\ntower built, which latter now is braced by clumsy obstructions within\r\nthe church. In the XIV century rose the west façade, and the north tower\r\nwas rebuilt. The XV century rehandled the high vaulting and clearstory,\r\nwhere appear die-away moldings and flamelike tracery. The abbey was\r\nfounded by Richard II (d. 1020) and his beautiful duchess, Judith of\r\nBrittany. Its Romanesque abbatial was dedicated in 1067 by Archbishop\r\nMaurille in the presence of the Conqueror and Matilda. In 1107 the\r\nabbatial was burned by Henry I of England, who accused the abbot of\r\nsiding with his elder brother, with whom he was at war, but in atonement\r\nthe king contributed toward the reconstruction of the church; _Congrès\r\nArchéologique_, 1861, 1862, and 1908, p. 278; J.

Bernay was founded between\r\n1013 and 1019 by Richard II and Judith of Brittany, the same who invited\r\nto their duchy the Lombard, William of Volpiano. William is known to\r\nhave worked on the Bernay abbatial, which shows resemblances to\r\nBurgundian churches at Auxerre and Nevers, and he may have brought to\r\nNormandy the Lombard trait of absidal chapels projecting from the\r\neastern wall of the transept. Bernay, however, did not use the Lombard\r\nalternance of ground supports. Mr. Bilson thinks that the tall attached\r\nstripes were intended for a vaulted, not for a timber roof. The nave's\r\nside walls and piers are of Abbot William's time; two bays of the choir\r\nbelong to later years of the XI century. William the Conqueror is said\r\nto have finished the church. It was grievously sacked during the\r\nreligious wars. The church of Ste. Croix in Bernay, begun, 1373,\r\nenlarged 1497, contains tombs from Bec, of former abbots there. _Congrès\r\nArchéologique_, 1908, vol. 2, p. 588, Chanoine Porée; _Bulletin\r\nMonumental_, 1911, vol. 75, p. 396, Chanoine Porée, and p. 403, John\r\nBilson; G.T.

He had been blessed\r\nas a child in his father's castle near Braine by a passing guest, the\r\nIrish missionary, St. Columbanus, and he loved to trace thence his\r\nvocation. So rich grew the abbey of St. Ouen that it ruled half the city\r\nas temporal lord. In the XV century the English expelled Abbot Jean\r\nRichard, a builder of the present nave, to substitute a prelate docile\r\nto themselves who sat as judge at Jeanne's trial. But the pope restored\r\nJean Richard in 1434, and he lived to entertain Charles VII in his\r\nmonastery when that king came as victor to Rouen in 1449. Vacandard,\r\n_Vie de St. Ouen_ (Paris, 1902).\r\n\r\n[340] To a Romanesque abbatial of St. Ouen, burned in 1136, belonged the\r\ntwo-storied chapel called the Chambre-aux-Clercs, now set against the\r\nnorthern limb of the transept. In 1318 Abbot Jean Roussel, called Marc\r\nd'Argent, began the present abbatial, making its choir and transept in\r\ntwenty years, as well as one bay of the nave. After a pause, two more\r\nbays were finished by 1390. Another cessation of work came during the\r\nHundred Years' War. Alexander Berneval set up the transept's south rose\r\n(1439), made the pretty southern portal (1441) called after the\r\nmarmosets decorating it; his son put up the north rose. Both architects\r\nrepose in the same tomb in the church. Many hold the central lantern (c.\r\n1490) to be a prime success of Flamboyant art. Flame tracery appeared in\r\nthe XV-century windows, but the Rayonnant first plan was adhered to for\r\nthe chief lines, so that the church, whose building extended over two\r\ncenturies, is homogeneous. The abbatial was finished under Abbot Bohier\r\n(1491-1515). The Huguenots stripped it of its tombs, and lighted\r\nbonfires in the church. In the XIX century was added the mediocre west\r\nfaçade.\r\n\r\n_La Normandie monumentale et pittoresque_. _Seine-Inférieure_, p. 105,\r\n\"St. Ouen\"; p. 129, \"St. Maclou\"; H.

Only the\r\nchoir bay has retained the polychrome decoration which once covered the\r\ninterior.

Of the same date are the\r\nfaçade, nave, and square-ended choir of Notre Dame at Grand-Andely. Its\r\ncentral tower is of the XV century; the transept is a gem of Flamboyant\r\nGothic. The most brilliant of its windows date from 1540 to 1616. Above\r\nthe smaller Andely stands Château Gaillard, the \"Saucy Castle,\" which\r\nRichard the Lion-hearted built in a year. Its capture in 1204 by\r\nPhilippe-Auguste ended the English resistance in Normandy at that\r\nperiod. Five miles away are the remains of the magnificent château of\r\nGaillon, where every master of the Renaissance in France was employed.\r\nBegun in 1454 by Cardinal d'Estouteville, it was carried forward by\r\nCardinal George I d'Amboise and Cardinal de Bourbon. Its bas-relief of\r\nSt. George and the dragon is one of the three authenticated works of\r\nMichel Colombe. A façade of Gaillon is now in the courtyard of the\r\nBeaux-Arts at Paris.

The kneeling figure on the tomb is the\r\nnotorious Diane de Poitiers, his widow. The critics say that if the De\r\nBrézé mausoleum is not the work of Jean Goujon, Diane's favorite\r\nsculptor, then there must have been living here an unknown XVI-century\r\nmaster of the first order. Jean Goujon was in Rouen, making the wooden\r\ndoors of St. Maclou, at that time.\r\n\r\nPaul Vitry, _Jean Goujon_ (Collection, Les Grandes Artistes), (Paris, H.\r\nLaurens, 1908); Louis Gonse, _La sculpture française depuis le XIVe\r\nsiècle_ (Paris, 1895); Léon Palustre, _La Renaissance en France_, vol. 1\r\n(Paris, Quantin, 1888), 3 vols.\r\n\r\n[344] Camille Enlart, on the origin of Flamboyant Gothic, in the\r\n_Archæological Journal_, 1886, and in _Histoire de l'Art_ (éd.

Simpson, expresses the _joie de vivre_,\r\neven as the stiff angular lines of a contemporary style--the English\r\nPerpendicular--show the gloom that prevailed in England after the War of\r\nthe Roses. Cardinal Guillaume d'Estouteville contributed toward St.\r\nMaclou, which was dedicated only in 1521, by Cardinal Georges II\r\nd'Amboise. Jean Goujon probably made the richly chiseled doors. St.\r\nMaclou has XV-century windows; its rose windows are of the XVI century.\r\nThere is Le Prince glass in the late-Gothic church of St. Vincent, and\r\nother XVI-century windows in St. Patrice.

Other Flamboyant Gothic monuments in\r\nNormandy are Louviers' lacelike portal (1493); churches at Dieppe; the\r\ntransept of Évreux Cathedral; St. Jacques at Lisieux; St. Pierre at\r\nCoutances; Les Andelys, Elbeuf, Gisors, and the joyous festival of stone\r\nof Notre Dame at Alençon, where the shady north side of the nave is\r\nadorned with Old Testament scenes, and the sun-lit southern wall opened\r\nby spacious Flamboyant traceries that frame the New Testament; its Jesse\r\ntree is unusual. Notre Dame at St. Lô (which has a Becket window) shows\r\nPerpendicular traits. Its west portals are strangely dissimilar, as are\r\nits monumental towers. Near Fécamp, the Estouteville family founded\r\nValmont abbatial (1116) now unroofed save its Lady chapel, in which are\r\nsplendid tombs, a reredos of the Annunciation that is a gem of\r\nXVI-century realism, and a window that inspired Eugène Delacroix's\r\npalette.\r\n\r\n[348] Sir Theodore Andreas Cook, _Twenty-five Great Houses of France_,\r\nchap. 12 (New York and London, 1916).\r\n\r\n[349] Flaubert, born in Rouen, 1821, died near the city, at Croisset, in\r\nhis ancient house that formerly belonged to the monks of St. Ouen. The\r\nincreased river activities during the World War have encroached on his\r\nproperty. His pupil, Guy de Maupassant, born near Dieppe, was associated\r\nwith his mother's city, Rouen, where stands his statue (1853-93). The\r\nhouse of the great Corneille (1636-1709) is near Rouen's Old Market.\r\nOther sons of Rouen were La Salle, the explorer (d. 1687), and the\r\npainter Géricault (1791-1824). Nicholas Poussin (1594-1665) was born at\r\nLes Andelys; Jean-François Millet, near Cherbourg (1814-74); Auber, the\r\ncomposer (1782-1871), at Caen, as was the poet Malherbes (1555-1628).\r\nMézerai, whose history is considered the best account of the XVI-century\r\nreligious struggle in France, and his brother, Jean Eudes, founder of\r\nthe Eudists, were born near Caen. The great seamen, Tourville\r\n(1642-1701) and Du Quesne (1610-88), were Normans; so were Laplace, the\r\nmathematician (1749-1827), Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-59), Bernardin de\r\nSaint-Pierre (1736-1814), Octave Feuillet (1821-90), Léon Gautier\r\n(1832-97), Barbey d'Aurevilly (1808-89), and savants such as Simeon Luce\r\n(d. 1892), Gabriel Monod (d. 1912), Albert Sorel, Paul Allard, Leopold\r\nDelisle (d. 1910). The latter was led to decipher ancient manuscripts by\r\nC. de Gerville, who, with that other Norman, Arcisse de Caumont, was a\r\npioneer in mediæval archeology.\r\n\r\n[350] Jules Quicherat, the archæologist, was the first to place before\r\nthe public the records of Jeanne d'Arc's two trials. He printed\r\n(1841-49) five volumes in Latin for the _Société de l'histoire de\r\nFrance_. Accounts of Jeanne have been written by Wallon (Paris, 1877);\r\nMarius Sepet (Tours, 1885); Ayroles, S. J.

The study of Anatole\r\nFrance on Jeanne d'Arc is written from the rationalist standpoint that\r\nconsiders hers a case of hysteria fitted for medical science. No book on\r\nJeanne equals the contemporary records. The report of her two trials in\r\nRouen, and the testimony gathered from end to end of France to vindicate\r\nher memory in 1456, have been marshaled and clarified in a skilled legal\r\nmanner by a magistrate of Rouen: E. O'Reilly, _Les deux procès de\r\ncondamnation ... et la sentence de réhabilitation de Jeanne d'Arc_\r\n(Paris, Pion, 1868), 2 vols. This masterly work should be translated\r\ninto English. It is an example of the right way to write history. For\r\nCharles VII see Thomas Basin and Vallet de Viriville.\r\n\r\n[351] Boisguillaume, second clerk of the Rouen court in 1431, Manchon's\r\nassistant, testified before the three inquests for Jeanne's\r\nrehabilitation. He drew attention to the fact that all who had been\r\nculpable of the Maid's death had come to a swift or shameful end.\r\nEstivet was found dead in a gutter at the gates of Rouen; Loyseleur, the\r\nfalse confessor, was struck down suddenly; Cauchon expired\r\nignominiously. \"I call you to judgment before God for what you have\r\ndone,\" rang out Jeanne's words to these unworthy churchmen on her last\r\nday. Nicolas Midi, of the Paris Parliament, who drew up the odious\r\ntwelve accusations, and who sermonized Jeanne in the Old Market, was\r\nstricken with leprosy. A year after the execution died the young Duchess\r\nof Bedford, who had inflicted a gross outrage on Jeanne, and her death\r\ndetached from the English cause her brother, the Duke of Burgundy. Her\r\nhusband, John of Lancaster, regent-duke, brother of Henry V, died in\r\nfull youth, three years later, and was buried in Rouen Cathedral. His\r\nnephew, Henry VI, was dispossessed of his English crown, imprisoned, and\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\n[352] \"'Si j'y suis, Dieu m'y tienne; si je n'y suis, Dieu m'y veuille\r\nmettre: j'aimerais mieux mourir que de ne pas avoir l'amour de Dieu!' A\r\ncette réponse, les juges restèrent stupéfaits et rompirent\r\nsur-le-champ.\"--Testimony of the second clerk of the court,\r\nBoisguillaume, in 1450, before the inquest for the rehabilitation.\r\n\r\n[353] The Norman, Siméon Luce, has written of Jeanne: \"La Pucelle n'est\r\npas seulement le type le plus achevé du patriotisme, elle est encore\r\nl'incarnation de notre pays dans ce qu'il a de meilleur. Il y a dans la\r\nphysionomie de l'héroïne du XVe siècle, des traits qui la rattachent\r\nà la France de tous les temps, l'entrain belliqueux, la grâce légère, la\r\ngaieté prisesantière, l'esprit mordant, l'ironie méprisante en face de\r\nla force, la pitié pour les petits, les faibles, les malheureux, la\r\ntendresse pour les vaincus. De tels dons appartiennent à notre tradition\r\nnationale, et la libératrice d'Orléans les a possédés à un si haut degré\r\nque cette face de son génie a frappé tous ses admirateurs.\"\r\n\r\n[354] The Duke d'Alençon testified, in 1455, concerning Jeanne: \"I have\r\nheard captains who took part in the siege of Orléans declare that what\r\npassed there touched on the miraculous, that it was no human work. Apart\r\nfrom things of war Jeanne was a simple young girl; but for things of\r\nwar, wielding the lance, massing the army, preparing the battle,\r\narranging the artillery, she was remarkably skilled. All marveled that\r\nshe should show the ability and foresight of a captain who had warred\r\nfor thirty years. Especially in her control of artillery was she\r\nadmirable.\"\r\n\r\nEqually convincing is the testimony, in 1455, of the bastard of Orléans,\r\nthe great Dunois: \"I believe that Jeanne was sent of God and that her\r\nconduct in war was more a divine than a human act.... I heard the\r\nseneschal of Beaucaire, whom the king had appointed to watch over Jeanne\r\nin the wars, say that he believed there never was a woman more chaste. I\r\nheard Jeanne say to the king one day: 'When I am distressed that\r\ncredence is not given that it is Heaven has sent me to your aid, I\r\nwithdraw to a quiet place and I pray and complain to God, and, my prayer\r\nfinished, I hear a voice saying, \"_Fille Dè, va, va, va! Je serai à ton\r\nayde, va!_\" ' And in repeating what the voice said, Jeanne was--an\r\nextraordinary thing--in a marvelous ravishment, in a sort of ecstasy,\r\nher eyes lifted to heaven.\" E.

His sons were the poet-duke,\r\nCharles d'Orléans, and Dunois, his acknowledged bastard, the chief\r\ninstrument in ridding France of her invaders. Two grandsons of the\r\nbuilder of Pierrefonds ascended the French throne, Louis XII and Francis\r\nI, and those who undertake an architectural journey over France will\r\nsoon become familiar with the porcupine of the one and the salamander of\r\nthe other.

Nous avons battu bien des pays, couru\r\nbien des aventures, dissipé bien des dons: il nous reste la fidélité.\r\nNous serons derrière vous les vieux routiers qui escortaient Jeanne\r\nd'Arc.

Il faut\r\nqu'un tel amour monte de nous à Dieu qu'il tourne à nouveau sa face vers\r\nnotre terre de France et, retrouvant son peuple, décide de le sauver.\r\nMais ne l'a-t-il pas déjà décidé, puisqu'il vous a envoyée?\" P.

In most of these churches the\r\ncolored windows are remarkable.\r\n\r\n[360] The son of that union was the trouvère poet, Thibaut IV of\r\nChampagne and I of Navarre, of which latter domain he was chosen king in\r\n1234, on the death of his mother's brother, Sancho, the chief victor of\r\nLas Navas de Toloso. His niece, Jeanne, inheriting both Champagne and\r\nNavarre, united them with the royal domain by her marriage to Philippe\r\nle Bel. Three of her sons ruled successively as kings of France, and\r\nthen the Valois branch--sprung from a brother of Philippe le Bel--came\r\nto the throne. Whereupon the Navarrese elected, as their ruler, the\r\nCount of Évreux, who had married a daughter of Jeanne's. His son was\r\nCharles the Wicked (1319-87), Count of Évreux, king of Navarre, who in\r\nturn was succeeded by his son, Charles the Noble (1387-1425). One and\r\nall of them were linked with the architectural story of France: at\r\nTroyes, Provins, Meaux, Mantes, and Évreux Cathedral.\r\n\r\n[361] In Normandy, glass of the XIV century is to be found in the\r\ncathedrals of Séez and Coutances, at Carentan, Pont-de-l'Arche,\r\nNesle-St.-Saire, and in Rouen's big abbatial. Elsewhere in France there\r\nare XIV-century windows at Mantes, Beauvais, Amiens, Dol, Limoges,\r\nToulouse, Bordeaux, Narbonne, Béziers, Carcassonne (in St. Nazaire),\r\nChartres (in St. Pierre), and Poitiers (in Ste. Radégonde). In St.\r\nUrbain's at Troyes is some of the earliest glass of this century.\r\n\r\n[362] Normandy's XV-century glass, besides that of Évreux' Lady chapel,\r\ncan be studied at Rouen, in the cathedral, and the churches of St. Ouen\r\nand St. Maclou, at Caudebec, Bernay, Vereuil, Beaumont-le-Roger, St. Lô,\r\nCarentan, Falaise, Pont-Audemer, Bayeux, and Coutances. Elsewhere in\r\nFrance glass of this period can be seen in Amiens Cathedral, in the\r\nVendôme chapel of Chartres, in the choir of Moulins, in the north\r\ntransept of Le Mans, and the windows presented to Bourges Cathedral by\r\nthe Duke of Berry and Jacques Coeur. There is also XV-century glass at\r\nClermont-Ferrand, Eymoutiers, Riom, in some of the churches of Paris,\r\nsuch as St. Sévérin, and in Brittany, at Dinan, Plélan, Les Iffs, and in\r\nQuimper Cathedral. Windows of the XVI century abound in Normandy. The\r\nmost imposing array is near Évreux, at Conches, whose church of Ste. Foi\r\nis on no account to be missed. Aldégrevier, a pupil of Albert Dürer,\r\ndesigned the seven tall apse windows, about 1520. There are eighteen\r\nother lights (1540-53), very Raphaelesque in type; the _Pressoir_ window\r\nand the apotheosis of the Virgin are typical of that heated hour of\r\ncontroversy.

On the road from Coutances to Cherbourg is the abbatial\r\nof Lessay (a contemporary of St. Étienne at Caen), said by M. Arcisse de\r\nCaumont to be one of the purest models of Norman Romanesque, an austere\r\nmonument of the XI-century type. Differences in the pier's profiles show\r\nwhere, in the nave, the XII century resumed work. In this latter period\r\nGothic ribs were prepared for from the planting of the piers, but the\r\nactual diagonals of the nave were built in the XIII century. Mr. John\r\nBilson claims that the Gothic ribs of the two sections preceding the\r\napse are of the XI century, which again brings up the controversy of\r\npriority in the use of diagonals.\r\n\r\nThe Cistercian church of La Blanche at Mortain was another abbatial of\r\nthe Manche, dedicated in 1206. At Cerisy-la-Forêt the abbey church was\r\nbegun (c. 1130) by the Fécamp school of William of Volpiano, continued\r\nby Duke Robert the Magnificent, and finished by his son William the\r\nConqueror. The nave was built from west to east in the last quarter of\r\nthe XI century, the apse slightly after 1100, the actual vaulting a\r\ncentury later. The religious wars and the Revolution sacked the\r\nabbatial; in 1811 its demolition was still going on.\r\n\r\n_Congrès Archéologique_, 1908, p. 242, \"Lessay,\" Lefèvre-Pontalis; p.\r\n553, \"Cerisy-la-Forêt,\" André Rhein; _Congrès Archéologique_, 1860, on\r\nCherbourg; _La Normandie monumentale et pittoresque_. _Manche_, p. 173,\r\n\"Lessay\"; p. 1, \"St. Lô\"; p. 51, \"Carentan\"; p. 73, \"Cerisy-la-Forêt\";\r\np. 153, \"Hambye\"; R.
