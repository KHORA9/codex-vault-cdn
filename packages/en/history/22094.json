WYLD, CHARING CROSS EAST]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE sentiment of Antiquity--that \"The life of no man is pleasing to the\r\ngods which is not useful to his fellows,\"--has been my guiding principle\r\nof action during the last twelve years of my life. To live for my own\r\nsimple and sole gratification, to have no other object in view but my own\r\npersonal profit and renown, would be to me an intolerable existence. To\r\nbe useful, or to attempt to be useful, in my day and generation, was the\r\npredominant motive which led me into The Desert, and sustained me there,\r\nalone and unprotected, during a long and perilous journey.\r\n\r\nBut, in presenting this work to the British public, I have to state, that\r\nit is only _supplementary_ and _fragmentary_. If, therefore, any one were\r\nto judge of the results of my Saharan Tour merely by what is here given,\r\nhe would do me a great injustice. I had expected, by this time, that\r\ncertain Reports on the Commerce and Geography of The Great Desert, as\r\nwell as a large Map of the Routes of this part of Africa, would have been\r\ngiven to the public. It is not my fault that their publication is still\r\ndelayed. I can only regret it, because what I am now publishing comes\r\n_first_, instead of _last_, and consequently deranges my plan, the\r\nfollowing pages being, indeed, _supplementary_ to the Reports and Map. I\r\ncome, therefore, before the public with no small disadvantage.\r\n\r\nWith regard to these supplementary and fragmentary extracts from my\r\njournal, I have also to state, they consist only of about two-thirds of\r\nthe journal. For the present, I deemed it prudent to suppress the rest.\r\nBut this likewise may disturb the harmony and mar the completeness of the\r\nwork. However, if these portions of the journal are favourably received,\r\nother extracts may yet be published.\r\n\r\nOn entering The Desert, my principal object was to ascertain how and to\r\nwhat extent the Saharan Slave-Trade was carried on; although but a\r\ncomparatively small portion of the following pages is devoted to this\r\nsubject. I have already reported fully on this traffic, and it was\r\nunnecessary to go over the ground again, which might defeat, by\r\ndisagreeable repetitions and endless details, the object which I have in\r\nview,--that of exciting an abhorrence of the Slave-Trade in the hearts of\r\nmy fellow countrymen and countrywomen.\r\n\r\nIn these published extracts from my journal, I have endeavoured to give a\r\ntruthful and faithful picture of the Saharan Tribes; their ideas,\r\nthoughts, words, and actions; and, where convenient, I have allowed them\r\nto speak and act for themselves. This is the main object which I have\r\nundertaken to accomplish in this Narrative of my Personal Adventures in\r\nThe Sahara. The public must, and will, I doubt not, judge how far I have\r\nsucceeded, and award me praise or blame, as may be my desert. If I have\r\nfailed, I shall not abandon myself to despair, but shall console myself\r\nwith the thought that I have done the best I was able to do under actual\r\ncircumstances, and in my then state of health. It would, indeed, ill\r\nbecome me to shrink from public criticism, after having braved the\r\nterrors and hardships of The Desert. However, the publication of this\r\njournal may induce others to penetrate The Desert,--persons better\r\nqualified, and more ably and perfectly equipped than myself, and who may\r\nso accomplish something more permanently advantageous than what I have\r\nbeen able to compass. Acting, then, as pioneer to others, my Saharan\r\nlabours will not be fruitless.\r\n\r\nBut, if any persons obstinately object to the style and matters of my\r\nNarrative of Desert Travel, I shall likewise as obstinately endeavour to\r\nhold my ground. To all such I say,--\"Go to now, ye objectors and\r\ngainsayers, and do better.\" My mission was _motu proprio_, and I plunged\r\nin The Desert without your permission. But I am but one of the two\r\nhundred millions of Europe. You can surely get volunteers. You have the\r\nmoney, the rank, the patronage, and the learned and philanthropic\r\nSocieties of Europe at your back. Send others; inspire them yourselves,\r\nand they may produce something which you like better than what I have\r\ngiven you. If I am not orthodox enough,--if I have not reviled the Deism\r\nof The Desert sufficiently to your taste,--send those who will. A little\r\nless zeal in Exeter Hall, and a little more in The Desert, would do\r\nneither you nor the world any harm. A little less clamour about Church\r\northodoxy, or any other doxy[1], and a little more anxiety for the\r\nwelfare of all mankind, would infinitely more become you, as Englishmen\r\nand Christians, and be more in harmony with that divine injunction, which\r\nsent out the first teachers of Christianity amongst the Greeks and\r\nBarbarians, in The City and The Desert, to preach the Gospel to every\r\ncreature under heaven. If I be too much of an abolitionist, send one who\r\nadmires slavery, and who will write up the Slave-Trade of The Desert. I\r\nhave written in my way: you write in your way. If my pages disclose no\r\ndiscoveries in science, this I can only lament. When a man has no science\r\nin him, or no education in science, he can give you none. But what are\r\nyour European Societies of Science for? Are they play-things, or are they\r\nserious affairs? Have you neither money nor zeal to equip a scientific\r\nexpedition to The Desert? If not, I cannot help you. By the way, I was\r\nastonished to receive, since my return, a note from one of your eminent\r\ngeologists, repudiating and protesting against all knowledge of the\r\nsubject of \"The Geology of The Desert.\" And The Desert is a fifth part of\r\nthe African Continent! Yet this gentleman dogmatizes and theorizes on\r\nall geological formations, and can tell the whole history of the geology\r\nof our planet, from the first moment when it was bowled by the hand of\r\nThe Omnipotent in the immensity of space, of suns and systems! If such\r\npresumption and self-willed ignorance discover themselves in great men,\r\nwhat are we to expect of little men?\r\n\r\nIn the following pages, I have encroached upon my Reports, to describe\r\nseveral of the Oases of The Desert, besides giving as much of the routes\r\nas was necessary to render the Narrative of my journey intelligible. But\r\nthis is all I could conscientiously do. For the rest of the geographical\r\ninformation, the public must wait.\r\n\r\nI return for a moment to the traffic in slaves. Born with an innate\r\nhatred of oppression, whatever form, or shape, or name it may take, and\r\nunder what modes soever it may be developed, mentally or bodily, in\r\nchaining men down under a political despotism, or in forging for them a\r\ncreed and forcing it on their consciences,--I have, since I could\r\nexercise the power of reflection, always looked upon the traffic in human\r\nflesh and blood as the most gigantic system of wickedness the world ever\r\nsaw; and which I most deplore, in this our late, more humane and\r\nenlightened age, stands forth and raises its horrid head, impiously\r\ndefying Heaven! In very truth, it is a system of crime, which dares\r\n\r\n    \"Defy the Omnipotent to arms!\"\r\n\r\nThe reader must, therefore, excuse the language with which I have\r\nexecrated this traffic in the pages of my Journal. There may be some men\r\nwho think it no crime to buy and sell their fellow-men; I have seen many\r\nsuch amongst the Moslems. But he who thinks the traffic in slaves to be a\r\ncrime against the human race, has a right to denounce it accordingly. I\r\nmust therefore make a few preliminary observations, though painful to my\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that the agitations of the Anti-Corn-Law League have\r\ngiven very lately a powerful impulse to the Slave-Trade, and slaves have\r\nrisen in Cuba to 30 and 50 per cent. above their previous average value,\r\nsince _slave_ sugar has been admitted upon the same terms, or nearly so,\r\nas _free-labour_ sugar, into England. This is entirely the work of The\r\nLeague. Some of these gentlemen think we must have cheap sugar at any\r\nrisk, at any cost, even if wetted with the blood of the slaves. A\r\nridiculous incident occurs to me. I once saw a child frightened into a\r\ndislike for white loaf sugar, by holding up a piece to the candle, and\r\npretending it dropped blood. But there is no delusion or metaphor here,\r\nfor the sugars of slave-plantations are really obtained by the\r\nblood-whippings and scourgings of the victimized slaves!\r\n\r\nAs to Cobden, his Cobdenites, and Satellites, they would sell their own\r\nsouls, and the whole human race into bondage, to have a free trade in\r\nslaves and sugar. This new generation of impostors--who teach that all\r\nvirtue and happiness consist in buying in the cheapest, and selling in\r\nthe dearest markets--are now dogging at the heels of Government, in\r\ncombination with the West India agents, to get them to re-establish a\r\nspecies of mitigated Slave-Trade, because, forsooth, there should be\r\nright and liberty to buy and sell a man, as there is right and liberty to\r\nbuy and sell a beast.\r\n\r\nI am not an enemy to Free Trade. I have duly noticed and praised the\r\nfree-trade mart of Ghat, and shown how it prospers in comparison with the\r\nrestricted system of the Turks, prevalent at Mourzuk. But this I do say,\r\nthe case of Slavery was an exceptional case, as the Ten Hours' Factory\r\nBill was an exceptional case in the regulation and restriction of labour.\r\nI fear, however, there are some of the Leaguers so outrageous in their\r\nadvocacy of abstract principles, that they would have a free-trade in\r\nvice--a free-trade in consigning people to perdition! They are of the\r\ncalibre of the men who wielded that dread engine of the \"Reign of\r\nTerror,\" the \"Committee of Public Safety,\" and made it death to speak a\r\nword against the \"One Indivisible Republic[2].\" These Leaguers are bent\r\nupon establishing an equal, although differently-formed, tyranny amongst\r\nus, and we cannot too soon and too energetically resist their odious and\r\nintolerable pretensions.\r\n\r\nBut I know not, whether these civil tyrants be so bad as the spiritual\r\ntyrants who have just set up for themselves what they call a \"Free Kirk.\"\r\nThese reverend gentlemen have received the fruits of the blood of the\r\nslaves, employed on the laborious fields of the Southern States of\r\nAmerica, to build up their new Free Church, pretending they have a\r\nDivine right to receive the value of the forced-labour of slaves, and\r\nquoting Scripture like the Devil himself. When called upon to refund they\r\nrefuse, and make the contributions of the Presbyterian slave-dealers of\r\nthe United States a sort of corner-stone of their Free Kirk. Why these\r\npriests of religion out-O'Connell-O'Connell, who point-blank refused, for\r\nthe support of his sham Repeal, and sent back contemptuously, the dollars\r\nspotted and tainted with the blood of the slaves! . . . . . . . . It is\r\nthe old story, the old trick of our good friends, the Scottish divines,\r\nand their old leaven of Scottish fanaticism. We know them of ancient\r\ndate. We have read a line of Milton, who in his time so admirably\r\nresisted their bigotry. It is immortal like all that our divine bard\r\nwrote. Here is the line--\r\n\r\n    \"New Presbyter is but old Priest writ large.\"\r\n\r\nThe Free Kirk has cut its connexion with the State, because it says the\r\nState wishes to enslave its ministers. Yet it has no objection to receive\r\nmonies from the slave-holders in America. The Free Kirk will build up its\r\nboasted freedom on the wasting blood and bones of the unhappy children of\r\nAfrica! Why, indeed, should these Scottish divines, headed by the\r\nPresbyters Candlish and Cunningham, seek or advocate the freedom of the\r\nslaves held by their fellow Presbyters of the United States? Is it not\r\nenough that they seek and maintain their own freedom, and at whatsoever\r\ncost? Have they not received the pro-slavery mantle of the late\r\nvenerated Dr. Chalmers, and can they, poor pigmies, possibly shake it\r\noff? Would it not be impious to do so? No, they cannot,--dare not do\r\nthis. For, as it was said by Lord George Bentinck, of a quondam champion\r\nof the people, in the last Session of Parliament, \"Liberty is on their\r\ntongues, but despotism is in their hearts.\"\r\n\r\nWhat can be more humiliating to a generous and tolerant mind, than to see\r\na body of Christian ministers struggling to obtain by a Parliamentary\r\nenactment, the cession of plots of land for building of churches for the\r\nworship of God in liberty and truth, from the tyrannical holders of the\r\nsoil; and, at the same time, this very body of priests does not scruple\r\nto receive the money of American slave-holders, to build and endow these\r\nself-same churches? Such incredible inconsistency makes one sick at\r\nheart, and inclined to question the existence of Christian feelings in\r\nthe professors and teachers of Christianity!\r\n\r\nIt is deeply to be deplored that our Anti-Slavery Society confines itself\r\nso much to protests, and what it calls \"the moral principle.\" No people\r\nof the world has done more for the liberties of Africa than the Society\r\nof Friends in England, and no people more admirably exemplify in their\r\nconduct the humane and pacific morals of Christianity. But when the\r\nFounder of our religion resisted his enemies by the remonstrance, \"Why\r\nstrikest thou me?\" something more was meant than a protest. We have had\r\nlately a _triste_ example of the end of protests in a neighbouring\r\ncountry. The annual protest of the French Chamber of Deputies against\r\nthe extinction of the nationality of Poland, not only ended in barren\r\nresults, and excited public ridicule, but actually terminated in the\r\ntriumph of the nefarious scheme against which it was made. Never was a\r\ncountry so humiliated as France in this case!--Its Chief, the Sovereign\r\nof its choice, consenting at the time, to the damning act of the\r\nextinction of Polish nationality, for the sake of accomplishing a low and\r\nscandalous family intrigue in Spain! This was something more than\r\nridiculous, and is one of the many infamies of our age, perpetrated on so\r\nlarge a scale. Now, I do not assert, that the protests of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society will end in the re-enactment of the Slave-Trade by\r\nthe British Parliament. But the last and present Sessions of Imperial\r\nParliament, show symptoms of our country abandoning Africa, after the\r\nlabours of half a century, to all the horrors of the Slave-Trade. Mr. P.\r\nBorthwick and Mr. Hume, more especially the latter, pleaded, in\r\nconjunction with others, during last Session, for the withdrawal of the\r\nBritish cruisers from off the Western Coast of Africa, and free trade in\r\nemigration, if not in slaves. In this good work, of course, they have the\r\nsympathies of the Anti-Slavery Free Trading League. Some of our journals\r\nopine, in their late articles, that a change has come over the spirit of\r\nour abolition dream, and suggest that the clerk, in charge of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Papers at the Foreign Office, is an old antiquated,\r\nsuperannuated being. In a word, these journals and Mr. Hume's pro-slavery\r\nclique, see no reason why Great Britain should not exhibit to this and\r\nsucceeding ages, the most dreadful bad faith in the case of British\r\nabolition. They would have us say to the world:--\"All our Anti-Slavery\r\nefforts, our Parliamentary enactments against Slavery, our huge blue\r\nbooks of published Anti-Slavery papers, our protocols and treaties with\r\nForeign Powers, all, each, and singular, are one grand organized system\r\nof selfishness and hypocrisy.\" I know very well that, in general,\r\nforeigners give us no credit whatever for our anti-slavery feelings and\r\npublic acts for the suppression of the Slave-Trade. This they have\r\nreiterated in my ears. And, how can they give us credit for sincerity in\r\nabolition, when our public men and public writers call for something like\r\nthe re-enactment of the British Slave-Trade?--and, whilst our quondam\r\nchampions of Free Churches receive the blood-stained money of\r\nslave-labour to build up their new ecclesiastical establishments? Mankind\r\nreason from actions, and not from verbal or written declarations. Our Act\r\nof Abolition, and the famous twenty millions, are not such wonderful\r\nthings after all, when we owed a hundred millions to the descendants of\r\nour slaves. We were also nearly half a century in abolishing the traffic,\r\nafter it had been denounced as robbery and murder by our highest and\r\ngreatest statesmen, Pitt and Fox[3]. This slowness of our work has given\r\nthe cue to the suspicions of our national enemies; and, certainly, to\r\nuse a gross vulgarism, has \"taken out the shine,\" or very much dimmed the\r\nlustre of this great act of justice to the African race.\r\n\r\nHere I cannot restrain myself from giving a word of caution to the\r\nworking-classes of our country, to those more especially who head the new\r\n\"National Society,\" and form other and similar leagues. You say the\r\npoliticians of the Anti-Corn Law League are your men; you adore your\r\nHumes, and Duncombes, and Wakleys. You, English democrats, or reformers,\r\nas you may call yourselves, admire the self-government and cheap\r\ngovernment of the Transatlantic Model Republic. You do well. But now read\r\nsome of their latest handiworks, without note or comment on my part. The\r\nviolent impulse given to the Slave-Trade in Cuba and the Brazils--the\r\nadvocacy of a free trade in Slaves by the Leaguers in and out the British\r\nParliament--the invasion and subjugation of Mexico, on the joint\r\nprinciples of lust of conquest and the extension of Slavery. Deny these\r\nfacts if you can. Learn, then, to think, there may be democracy and\r\nrepublicanism without liberty or freedom.\r\n\r\nI pray God, that the protests and public appeals and remonstrances to\r\nGovernment of the Anti-Slavery Society may not end in barren results. But\r\nif the Leaguers and Democrats have their own way, its voice, though just\r\nand righteous, will be at length reduced to a faint cry, a last shriek of\r\ndespair--overwhelmed by the loud laughs and jeers of the fiends, which\r\npossess the dealers in human flesh and blood, and surround unhappy and\r\ndoomed Africa with a cordon of rapine and murder, of blood and flames!\r\n\r\n    \"Where the vultures and vampires of Mammon resort,\r\n        Where Columbia exulting drains\r\n        Her life-blood from Africa's veins,\r\n    Where the image of God is accounted as base,\r\n    And the image of Cæsar set up in its place.\"\r\n\r\nIf I were asked, \"What can be done for Africa?\" I should reply with no\r\nnew thing, no nostrums of my own concocting, but what has been reiterated\r\nagain and again. Teach her children to till the soil--to cultivate\r\navailable exports by which they may obtain in exchange, through the\r\nmedium of a legitimate commerce, the European products and manufactures\r\nnecessary for their use and enjoyment. Until this be done, nothing\r\neffectual will be done. In vain you send missionaries of religion, or\r\nagents of abolition; in vain you contract treaties with the Princes of\r\nAfrica. It is humiliating to think, equally a disgrace to our religion as\r\nto our civilization, that our connexion with Africa has only served to\r\nplunge her into deeper misery and profounder degradation. With truth we\r\nhere may apply the strong censure of a Chinese Emperor, \"That the march\r\nof Christians is whitened with human bones.\" Wherever we have touched her\r\nwestern shores there our footsteps have been marked with blood and\r\ndevastation. We have fostered and encouraged within the heart of Africa\r\nthe most odious and unnatural passions. We have stimulated the prince to\r\nsell his subjects, the father to sell his child, the brother to sell the\r\nsister, the husband the wife, into thrice-accursed and again accursed\r\nslavery! We have done all and more than this, whilst we have convulsed\r\nevery state and kingdom of Africa with war, for the supply of cargoes of\r\nhuman beings. And for what? To cultivate our miserable cotton and sugar\r\nplantations! These are the doctrines of mercy and charity which we have\r\ntaught the poor untutored children of Africa. Happy for poor forlorn,\r\ndusky, naked Africa, had she never seen the pale visage or met the\r\nSatanic brow of the European Christian! Does any man in his senses, who\r\nbelieves in God and Providence, think that the wrongs of Africa will go\r\non for ever unavenged? Already, has not Providence avenged the wrongs of\r\nAfrica upon Spain and Portugal, by reducing their national character and\r\nconsideration to the lowest in the European family of nations? And as to\r\nthe United States of America, has not the boasted liberty of our\r\nRepublican countrymen, who colonized America, become a by-word, a\r\nhissing, and a scorn, amongst the nations of the earth? Have not these\r\nslave-holding Americans committed acts, nationally, within the last few\r\nyears, which the most absolute Governments of Europe would blush to be\r\nguilty of? And what is one of their last acts, on a smaller scale, but\r\nnot less decisively indicative of their national morality? The New York\r\nBible Society has declared that it will not give the Bible to slaves,\r\neven when they are able to read the Bible! Would the Czar of Russia\r\npermit such an impious rule as this to be made by his nobles for their\r\nslaves or serfs? Such an action would render the liberties of a thousand\r\nrepublics a mockery, a snare, and a delusion, and their names infamous\r\nthroughout the world.\r\n\r\nAnd the time of us Englishmen will come next--our day of infamy! unless\r\nwe show ourselves worthy that transcendant position in which Providence\r\nhas placed us, at the pinnacle of the empires of Earth, as the leaders\r\nand champions of universal freedom.\r\n\r\nIn noticing the efforts made for raising Africa from her immemorial\r\ndegradation, we are bound to confess our obligations to the Mahometans\r\nfor what they have done. If they have extirpated Christianity from the\r\nsoil of North Africa, and planted, instead of this tree of fair and pure\r\nfruit, the more glaring and showy plant of Islamism, they have, at the\r\nsame time, endeavoured to raise Africa to their own level of\r\ndemi-civilization. Whilst we condemn their slave-traffic as we condemn\r\nour own, we must do justice to the efforts which they have made, by the\r\nspread of their creed and the diffusion of their commerce, during a\r\nseries of ten or twelve centuries, for promoting the civilization of\r\nAfrica. They have succeeded, they have done infinitely more for Africa\r\nthan we ourselves. They have organized and established regular\r\ngovernments through all Central Africa, and inculcated a taste for the\r\noccupation and the principles of commerce. A great portion of this\r\ninternal trade is untainted by slavery. Bornou, Soudan, Timbuctoo, and\r\nJinnee, exhibit to us groups of immense and populous cities, all\r\nregularly governed and trading with one another. They have abolished\r\nhuman sacrifice, which lingers in our East India possessions to this day.\r\nThey have regulated marriage and restrained polygamy. They have made\r\nhonour and reverence to be paid to grey hairs, superseding the diabolical\r\ncustom of exposing or destroying the aged. They have introduced a\r\nknowledge of reading and writing. The oases of Ghat and Ghadames furnish\r\nmore children, in proportion, who can read and write, than any of our\r\nEnglish towns. The Koran is transcribed in beautiful characters by Negro\r\nTalebs on the banks of the Niger. The Moors have likewise introduced many\r\ncommon useful trades into Central Africa. But above all, the Mohammedans\r\nhave introduced the knowledge of the one true God! and destroyed the\r\nfetisch idols. Let us then take care how we arrogate to ourselves the\r\nright and fact of civilizing the world. Nay, there cannot be a question,\r\nif we would abandon Africa to the Mohammedans, and leave off our\r\nman-stealing trade and practices on the Western Coast, the dusky children\r\nof the torrid zones would gradually advance in civilization. But is not\r\nthe bare idea of such an alternative an indelible disgrace to\r\nChristendom?\r\n\r\nMr. Cooley, in his learned work, entitled \"The Negroland of the\r\nArabs[4],\" seems to doubt if the Slave-Trade can be abolished or\r\ncivilization advanced, in Central Africa, because of the neighbourhood of\r\nThe Desert. This, however, is transferring the guilt of slavery and of\r\nvoluntary barbarism, if barbarism can be crime, from the volition of\r\nresponsible man to a great natural fact, or circumstance of creation--The\r\nDesert; and is a style of observation perfectly indefensible, as well as\r\ncontrary to philosophy and facts. First, we cannot limit the stretch or\r\nprogress of the Negro mind any more than that of the European intellect.\r\nMr. Cooley himself admits that the Nigritian people have advanced in\r\ncivilization. And if they have advanced, why not continue to advance? But\r\nso far contrary are facts to Mr. Cooley's theory, that The Desert,\r\ninstead of being an obstacle to civilization, is favourable to it, whilst\r\nthe Nigritian countries beyond the influence of The Desert are plunged\r\ninto deeper barbarism. The reader will only have to compare my account of\r\nthe Touaricks, with the recently published account of the social state of\r\nthe kingdom of Dahomy, to convince himself how completely fallacious in\r\napplication is Mr. Cooley's theory[5]. Slaves, too, abound in thickly\r\npopulated countries as well as desert countries: witness China and India.\r\nThe Sahara, also, has its paradisical spots, or oases of enjoyment, as\r\nwell as its wastes and hardships. It is likewise, not true, that the\r\nSaharan tribes depend for their happiness on the possession of slaves, or\r\nthat life in The Desert is galling and insupportable. Many a happy oasis\r\nis without a slave. However this may be, it is always an extremely\r\ndangerous line of argument, to represent moral depravity as springing\r\nnecessarily from certain physical and unalterable circumstances of\r\ncreation. Finally, to represent The Great Desert as the buttress of the\r\nSlave-Trade, is contrary to all our experience. In deserts and mountains\r\nwe find always the free-men: in soft and luxurious countries we find the\r\nslaves. It is not the free-born Touarick who is the slave-dealer, or the\r\nstimulator of the slave-traffic, but the Moorish merchant, and the\r\nvoluptuary on the coast who sends him. All that the Saharan tribes do, is\r\nto escort the merchants over The Desert; and they would still escort them\r\nover The Desert did they not deal in slaves, carrying on only legitimate\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\nI may conclude by a word on Discoveries in The Sahara. It is now twenty\r\nyears or more since The Sahara was explored, or before my present\r\nhap-hazard tour. From what I have seen since my return, and the little\r\nencouragement given to this sort of enterprise,--the public of Great\r\nBritain being so much occupied with railways, free-trade, and currency\r\nquestions, educational schemes, and State endowed, or voluntary\r\necclesiastical establishments,--it is difficult to foresee how and when\r\nanother tour may be undertaken, or how a tourist will have the heart to\r\nmake another experiment. Unhappily, the spirit of discovery, like\r\nVirtue's self, is difficult to be satisfied with its own reward.\r\nSomething, however, may in time be expected from the French, who will get\r\nrestless in their Algerian limits, and make a bold effort to disenthral\r\nthemselves, by leaping the bounds of the mysterious Sahara. Evidently the\r\nFrench Government have prohibited all isolated attempts. But should their\r\ncolony succeed, and they must make it succeed, then a grand stroke of\r\npolicy and action will be struck upon the lines of the Saharan routes,\r\nfor diverting The Desert trade, if possible, into Algerian channels. We\r\nmust wait patiently this time for further researches. Necessity propels\r\nnations in the march of discovery. England has some considerable stake\r\nlikewise in the commerce of The Great Desert. But our governmental\r\naffairs are so vast, and ramify over so large a space of the world, that\r\nit is extremely difficult to get a Minister to strike out a new path,\r\nunless he has the sympathies and hearty support of the public with him.\r\nAnd certainly the last thing in the imagination of the British public is\r\nthe undertaking Discoveries in The Great Desert.\r\n\r\nA remark may be made respecting the English spelling of Arabic words and\r\nnames. I have not adopted the new system, as very few people understand\r\nit. I have endeavoured to represent the sounds of the original words in\r\nthe ordinary way, giving sometimes the Arabic letters for those who\r\nprefer greater correctness. The spelling of Oriental and African names is\r\nalso occasionally varied for the sake of variety, and sometimes I have\r\nwritten the words in various ways, according to the style of\r\npronunciation amongst different Saharan tribes. I have also omitted\r\naccents and italics as much as possible, to avoid confusion and trouble\r\nto the printer. With respect to the contents at the head of the chapters,\r\nnumberless little things and circumstances are besides unavoidably\r\nomitted in the enumeration.\r\n\r\nI have few acknowledgments to make to those who rendered me assistance in\r\nthe prosecution of my Saharan tour and researches. I have rather\r\ncomplaints to prefer against professed friends. I was unable to get up in\r\nThe Desert a single thing, the most trifling, to aid me in my\r\nobservations, when I had determined to penetrate farther into the\r\ninterior; whilst, somehow or other, a Memorandum was obtained from the\r\nPorte to recal me instead of a Firman to help me on my way. Fortunately I\r\nwas beyond its power when it arrived at Tripoli, from Constantinople. But\r\nif I feel the bitterness of this want of sympathy, and these acts of\r\nhostility, I have the pleasure of being triumphant over all the obstacles\r\nthrown in my way. I felt freer in The Desert, unloaded by obligations.\r\nIndeed, the fewer of these a traveller has, the better. He always\r\nsupports his trials and privations with lighter spirits and a more\r\ncheerful heart. His success is his own, if his failure is his own also.\r\nNevertheless I have not forgotten, nor can I ever forget, to the latest\r\nday of my life, the acts of kindness shown to me by the rude and\r\nsimple-minded people of The Desert, and I have duly and most scrupulously\r\nchronicled them all.\r\n\r\n                                           JAMES RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\n        LONDON,\r\n    _December, 1847._\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.--It is hoped, for the honour and humanity of our Government,\r\nthat they will resist the clamour to withdraw the Cruisers from the\r\nWestern Coast of Africa, and that they will NOT WITHDRAW the British\r\nCruisers. If a blow is to be struck, let it be struck at Cuba, or the\r\nBrazils, and not on the defenceless Africans, because they are\r\ndefenceless. If a burglar prowls about, a whole neighbourhood is on the\r\nalert to protect itself against his depredations. If a band of pirates\r\nswarm in a sea or infest our coasts, a fleet is fitted out to capture\r\nthem. But it is attempted to let loose upon weak, defenceless Africa a\r\nlegion of pirates and murderers--for such will be the result if the\r\nBritish Cruisers are withdrawn from the Western Coast.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See the newspapers for the correspondence between some of the\r\n    Bishops of our Church and the Premier. As the question is, Whether\r\n    Dr. Hampden be a Heretic or a Christian? I may here observe that\r\n    the term \"Christian\" is used in the following pages for\r\n    \"European.\" To the epithet \"Christian,\" in the strict sense of the\r\n    term, I have no other pretensions than that of being a\r\n    conscientious reader of the New Testament.\r\n\r\n[2] \"Une et indivisible.\"\r\n\r\n[3] Lord Brougham, in his Life of Pitt, very properly takes off\r\n    some discount from the Anti-Slavery zeal of this great Statesman,\r\n    for being so tardy in the work of Abolition, and allowing his\r\n    Under Secretaries and subordinate Ministers to support the\r\n    Slave-Trade against himself, and whilst he was advocating its\r\n    extinction.\r\n\r\n[4] \"It is impossible to deny the advancement of civilization in\r\n    that zone of the African continent which has formed the field of\r\n    our inquiry.

The greater part of\r\nhuman actions, however humiliating to our moral and intellectual dignity,\r\nis the result of sheer accident. That the accidents of life should\r\nharmonize with the immutable decrees of Providence, is the great mystery\r\nof an honest and thinking mind. The reading accidentally of a fugitive\r\n_brochure_, thrown upon the table of the public library of Algiers, gave\r\nme the germ of the idea, which, fructifying and expanding, ultimately led\r\nme to the design of visiting and exploring the celebrated Oasis of\r\nGhadames, planted far-away amidst the most appalling desolations of the\r\nGreat Saharan Wilderness. This should teach us to lower our pretensions,\r\nand take a large discount from our merits in originating our various\r\nenterprises; but, alas! our over-weening self-love always manages to get\r\nthe better of us. The _brochure_ alluded to was a number of the _Revue de\r\nL'Orient_, published at Paris, containing a notice of Ghadames by M.\r\nSubtil, the notorious sulphur[6]-explorer and adventurer of Tripoli.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Algiers, in January, 1845, I carried the idea of Ghadames with\r\nme to Tunis; and thence, after agitating an exploration to The Desert\r\namongst my friends, some of whom plainly told me, if I went I should\r\nnever return, I should be consumed with the sun and fever, or murdered by\r\nthe natives, and to attempt such a thing was altogether madness, I\r\njourneyed on to Tripoli, where I entered with all my soul and might into\r\nthe undertaking. But as in Tunis so in Tripoli, I heard the birds of\r\nevil-omen uttering the same mournful notes of discouragement:--\"I should\r\nnever reach Ghadames, no one else had done so, or no one else had gone\r\nand returned. I should perish by the hand of banditti, or sink under the\r\nburning heat. I was not the man; it required a frame of iron. Enthusiasm\r\nwas very well in its way, but it required a man who was expert in arms,\r\nand who could fight his way through The Desert.\" And such is the absurd\r\ncharacter of men, and some people pretending to be friends of African\r\ndiscovery, that, on hearing of my safe return after nine months' absence,\r\nthey felt chagrined their sagacious vaticinations were not verified. Like\r\na man who writes a book, and ever so bad a book, he cannot afterwards\r\nadopt a right sentiment, or course of action, because he has written his\r\nbook. It is true, the fate of Davidson, in Western Barbary, and the late\r\ndisastrous mishap of the young Tuscan on his return from Mourzuk,\r\nfavoured the pretensions of these Barbary-coast prophets, who cannot\r\ncomprehend a deviation from what had happened before, but it is equally\r\ntrue that the violent deaths of these individuals, so far as we can\r\ngather from the details, were brought about by the greatest possible\r\nimprudence on their part. However, I may say without hesitation, no\r\npeople dread The Desert so much, and have in them so little of the spirit\r\nof enterprise and African discovery, as the naturalized Europeans of\r\nTunis and Tripoli, and other parts of Barbary. To purchase the\r\nco-operation of a volunteer in these countries would require more money\r\nthan defraying the expense of an expedition, and after all, from the love\r\nof intrigue and double-dealing which Europeans long resident in Barbary\r\nacquire, as well as other drawbacks, you would be very badly served.\r\n\r\nI shall begin the narrative of my personal adventures in The Sahara with\r\nmy departure from the island of Jerbah to Tripoli.\r\n\r\n_May 7th, 1845._--Left Jerbah in the evening for Tripoli in the coaster\r\n_Mesâoud_ (\"happy\"). The captain and owner was a Maltese, but the colours\r\nunder which we sailed were Tunisian. Generally, a Moorish captain _di\r\nbandeira_ commands these coasters, because it saves them dues at the\r\nvarious ports. Indeed, most of the small coasting craft of Tunis and\r\nTripoli, though the property of Europeans, sail under the Turkish, rather\r\nMahometan (_red_) flag. Although May, our captain told me, it was the\r\nworst month in the year for coasting in Barbary. The wind comes in sudden\r\npuffs and gales, blowing with extreme violence everything before it,\r\nprostrating and rooting up the stoutest and strongest palm-trees. So, in\r\nfact, as soon as we got out, a _gregale_ (\"north-easter\") came on\r\nterrifically, and occasioned us to return early next morning to Jerbah.\r\nDuring the night, we were nearly swamped a few miles from the shore. The\r\n_gregale_ continued the next two days, striking down several of the\r\ndate-trees with great fury. When these trees are so struck down, the\r\npeople do not make use of the wood for months, nay years, because it is\r\nill-luck. Jerbah is a grand focus of wind, and it sometimes blows from\r\nevery point of the compass in twelve hours. Æolus seems to patronize this\r\nisle; and, as at Mogador on the Atlantic, wind here supplies the place of\r\nrain. The inhabitants of Mogador have wind nine months out of twelve; but\r\nseasons pass without a shower of rain.\r\n\r\n_10th._--Evening. Left again for Tripoli. We passed the night about ten\r\nmiles off the island, amongst the fishing apparatus, which looks at a\r\ndistance like so many little islets. They consist of mere palm-tree\r\nboughs, struck deep into the mud as piles are driven; and large spaces\r\nare thus enclosed. When the tide[7] falls, the fish get entangled or\r\nenclosed in these enclosures, and are caught. Very fine fish are taken,\r\nand a fifth of the ordinary sustenance of the islanders is derived from\r\nthis fishing. Unhappily the poor fishermen are obliged to pay from\r\ntwenty-five to fifty per cent. of the fish caught to Government; so the\r\npoor in all countries are the worse treated because they are poor.\r\n\r\n_11th._--The wind becoming again foul, we put into a little place called\r\nSâkeeah, a port of the island in the S.E. Here is nothing in the shape of\r\na port town, only a small square ruinous hovel of mud and plaster, and a\r\nrude hut put up temporarily by a Maltese, who is building a boat. I often\r\nthink the Maltese are the _Irish_ of the South. Maltese enterprise is\r\nprevalent in all parts of the Mediterranean but in their own country. The\r\nport, such as it is, is defended by a little round battery, four feet\r\nhigh, with three rusty pieces of cannon. If these could be fired off, the\r\nmasonry would tumble to pieces. This is the _present_ state of all the\r\nfortifications of Mahometan Barbary. It frequently happens that when a\r\nvessel of war visits the smaller Barbary ports, and wishes to fire a\r\nsalute in honour of the governors, it is kindly requested this may not be\r\ndone, because it is necessary etiquette to return the salute, and, if\r\nreturned, the masonry of the fortifications may tumble down. The scene\r\nwas wild and bare; the colours of the landscape light and bright. There\r\nwere some Moors winnowing barley. An ox was treading out the corn, in\r\nScripture fashion. Crops of barley and other grain are grown all over\r\nthis fertile isle, under the date-palm and olive trees. Small boats were\r\nwaiting to carry off the grain to Tunis. As in Ireland, little remains to\r\nfeed the people. They must feed on dates, or fish, or vegetables and\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n_12th._--Left Sâkeeah with a strong breeze. On looking back on the island\r\nit had the appearance of thousands of date-palms, boldly standing out of\r\nthe sea, the land being so low as not to be discernible a few miles'\r\ndistance. Jerbah, from this appearance, as from reality, deserves the\r\nname of the \"Isle of Palms.\" After crossing the channel, which runs\r\nbetween the island and the continent, whose waters were deep and rough,\r\nwe got aground in the Shallows, off Zarzees. This place is a round tower\r\n(_burge_) on the continent, with a few houses and plantations of olives\r\nand dates. Here commences the shoal-water, or _bassa-fondo_, as our\r\nsemi-Italian boatmen called it, which continues east along the coast for\r\neighty miles, as far as Rais-el-Makhbes. When we got off again, at the\r\nflow of the tide, we passed Biban (\"two doors\"), the frontier place of\r\nthe Tunisian dominions. Biban is a castle, with some fifty Arab houses,\r\nbuilt of palm-wood and leaves in the shape of hay-stacks, and is situate\r\non an islet, on each side of which the sea passes inland and forms a\r\nlarge lagoon. There is at Biban a single European resident, an Italian,\r\nwho acts as a French agent and spy on the frontiers of Tunis and Tripoli.\r\nHe is paid about eighteen-pence a day, cheap enough for his high\r\npolitical mission. The French are mighty fond of planting spies all over\r\nBarbary; but espionage is their forte. In the evening we arrived at the\r\n_Salinæ_[8], \"salt pits,\" on the coast, where we found several small\r\ncoasters loading with salt for Tripoli. Salt is also exported from this\r\nplace to Europe. Here we brought up for the night, creeping and feeling\r\nour way as in the days of ancient navigation. Our bringing up, however,\r\nwas fortunate, for the wind suddenly blew a gale from the N.W.,\r\ncontinuing all night, and until next day, when it fell a dead calm again.\r\nStrange weather for the fine month of May. But the Mediterranean, which\r\nis called the \"_home_ station,\" is one of the nastiest chafing seas in\r\nthe world, and in this fair season of the year is exposed to the most\r\ntremendous squalls, nay, continuous gales of wind.\r\n\r\n_13th._--We weighed again our little anchor, and in the afternoon cast it\r\nbefore Rais-el-Makhbes, the last anchoring ground of the _bassa-fondo_.\r\nThe shore from Zarzees to Rais-el-Makhbes is extremely low. The\r\n_bassa-fondo_ stretches off the coast in some places at least thirty or\r\nforty miles, and is so shallow, that boats of the smallest burden often\r\nground. Here our Maltese captain observed to me, with great mystery,\r\n\"See, _Signore_, we must now be very cautious how we act, and watch the\r\nwind, so as to take it on the very first breath of its being favourable,\r\nfor from here it is all deep water to Tripoli.\" In general, however, the\r\nMaltese captains display more courage than the Italians in these\r\ncoasters.\r\n\r\n_14th._--In the morning we cleared Cape Makhbes. The captain was to have\r\nrounded it and entered the little port of Zouwarah, where there is a\r\nquarantine agent, and landed me there according to agreement. I had\r\nletters for this place, and was to have gone thence to Tripoli by land,\r\ntwo or three days' journey. On remonstrating, he gravely asked, \"Whether\r\nI wished to do him an injury, compelling him to go to Zouwarah, from\r\nwhich port he couldn't get out for the wind?\" Perceiving the captain had\r\nfully made up his mind to break a written agreement, signed before the\r\nConsul, for the temporary advantage now offering, I left off\r\nremonstrating, though extremely dissatisfied. We continued our course. It\r\nsoon fell calm, and, as usual, the calm was again succeeded with a\r\nviolent _gregale_, against which we could not make head. I now told our\r\nPalinurus it was necessary to look out for the port of Tripoli Vecchia,\r\notherwise we should be obliged to go back or keep the open sea all night,\r\nfor we could not reach Tripoli to-day. Half an hour elapsed, and the wind\r\ncontinuing to freshen, the captain took my advice. We turned direct\r\nsouth, and sought the port. After experiencing some difficulty, during\r\nwhich the captain, to my surprise, discovered the most serious alarm, we\r\nfound and entered the wished-for haven. It was a real miracle of good\r\nluck, for the wind came on dreadfully, the angry spray was covering us\r\nwith water, and our sufferings would have been beyond description if we\r\nhad been obliged to keep the sea. Our bark was a mere cockle-shell, into\r\nwhich were rammed and jammed and crammed twenty-two mortal and immortal\r\nbeings: _C'est à dire_, four sailors, fourteen Moorish passengers,\r\nincluding a woman and a child, two Jews, myself, and a runaway slave. So\r\nthat our heartfelt thankfulness to a good Providence, pitying our folly\r\nand imprudence, may be easily imagined. In the midst of our confusion\r\nwhile searching for the port--having only three or four hours' daylight\r\nbefore us--the most ludicrous scene was enacted, which might have ended\r\nin the tragic. Some of the Moors professed to know the port of Tripoli\r\nVecchia. Hereupon each fellow gave a different description, a thing\r\nperfectly natural, as each would have seen the port under different\r\ncircumstances of time and place. \"It was surrounded with white\r\ncliffs,--it was black,--rocky,--it was a sandy shore.\" All bawled and\r\nclamoured together. The captain put his fingers in his ears with rage. He\r\nhad never been in before, or his men. At last, losing all patience, the\r\nMaltese fire got up, blown to fury, and, seizing a knife, the captain\r\nswore he would cut their throats if they didn't hold their tongues, or\r\ngive a more distinct account of the port. This menace cowed them down\r\nlike so many bullies, and they fell into a moody but vindictive silence,\r\ntheir looks discovering the internal oaths of revenge. It was really\r\ndroll, if the words used allow the expression, to hear how the captain\r\nblended Italian, Maltese, and Arabic oaths and abuse in his rage. Now\r\n\"_Santo Dio!_\" now \"_Scomunicat!_\" _Sacrament!_ now \"_Allah!_\" \"_Imshe_,\"\r\n\"_Kelb_,\" \"_Andat_,\" \"_per Bacco!_\" &c. At length, when a sailor from the\r\nmast-head descried the port, and a tremendous surf was seen or said to be\r\nseen rolling near the entrance, the Moors, who although mostly sulky\r\nunder the influence of their fatalism, and show very little courage in\r\nthe dangers of the sea, cried out with fear, \"Allah, Allah!\" \"Ya,\r\nMohammed!\" (O God! O God! O Mahomet!) The captain even felt disposed to\r\nblubber at the sight of the furious surf, so nothing less could be\r\nexpected from the passengers. A bad example is this to the sailors and\r\npeople, but one which often occurs aboard Italian and Maltese vessels.\r\n\r\n_15th._--The wind continued all night and the following day. It dropped\r\ndown on the afternoon of the 16th; on the 17th a pleasant breeze sprung\r\nup, and continued until we got within a couple of miles off Tripoli. We\r\nwere followed for three hours by a shoal of porpoises, some nearly as big\r\nas our bark, which enjoyed highly the run with us, \"_perceiving_,\" as the\r\ncaptain said, \"_our motion_.\" The first night of our anchorage in the\r\nTripoli Vecchia, we had several alarms that the tiny bark had dragged its\r\nanchor, and was about to take us out into the open sea: no one could\r\nsleep. After the wind subsided, our _Christian_ sailors were alarmed that\r\nwe might have our throats cut by the _Ishmaelite_ Arabs from the shore\r\nthe next night. When it was quite calm we went on shore to search for\r\nwater; we found a well of good water on the N.E. landing of the port. A\r\npalm beckoned us to the spring, but a single palm is often found where\r\nthere is no well or water; and it is not true, as vulgarly supposed, that\r\nwhere there are date-palms there must be water. The country in this\r\nvicinity is a perfect desert, yet on this arid waste shepherds drive\r\ntheir flocks in the spring, and up to May and June. The captain\r\nconsidered Tripoli Vecchia, which is a very ancient port, and the site of\r\na once famous city, more secure than that of Tripoli itself, though\r\ncertainly much smaller. Whilst we were here no bark visited it.\r\nGood-sized ships occasionally anchor in it. Like Tripoli, it is defended\r\nwith a sunken reef of rocks, some peaks of which rise several feet out of\r\nthe water. Along this line is a strong surf always chafing and roaring.\r\nThere are two mouths of entrance; the deepest water within is about\r\ntwelve or fourteen feet. There is another but much smaller port, two\r\nmiles further east; the coast from this to Tripoli offers nothing to the\r\ntourist. Twelve miles this way begin those forests of fine broad-waving\r\npalms, which form so noble a feature in the suburban landscape of\r\nTripoli. When we got off Tripoli we had a dead calm, and myself looking\r\nabout for the wind, the Moors got angry, and said, \"Be still; if you\r\nrestlessly stare about, and wish the wind to come, it will never come:\r\nyou cast the '_eye malign_' upon it.\" These superstitious ideas are not\r\npeculiar to the Moors. An English captain once told me, if I continued to\r\nstay below, the wind would never be fair. Tripoli looked here very bold,\r\nmassive, and imposing from the sea; its broad lime-washed towers, and the\r\ngraceful minarets beyond, all dazzling white in the sun, contrasting with\r\nthe dark blue waters of the Mediterranean. Such is the delusion of all\r\nthese sea-coast Barbary towns; at a distance and without, beauty and\r\nbrilliancy, but near and within, filth and wretchedness.\r\n\r\nA word of my fellow passengers and crew. Our Maltese _Rais_, although he\r\nbroke his agreement with me, behaved well; I therefore paid him,\r\nrequesting the Chancellor of our Consulate only to scold him, and warn\r\nhim for the future. He is a good Maltese Christian; and when I told him\r\nMalta had fifty years' possession of Tripoli, he replied, \"Ah, how the\r\nworld changes! what a pity God has given this fine country into the hands\r\nof rascally Turks.\" Sometimes he would kick the Moors about and through\r\nthe ship like cattle: at other times he would say, \"Aye, come,\r\n_bismillah_[9],\" and help them to a part of his supper. The Moors\r\nprovided for only _four_ days' provisions, a day over the average time,\r\nand they were all out of bread before arriving at Tripoli. The captain\r\nconsulted me as to what was to be done; we arranged to supply them with a\r\nfew biscuits every day, I taking the responsibility of payment, pitying\r\nthe poor devils. If a Moor has a good passage at sea, he says, \"Thank\r\nGod!\" if not, _Maktoub_, (\"It is written,\") and quietly submits to the\r\nevils which he has brought on himself by sheer imprudence. Their\r\nprovisions, in this case, consisted of barley-meal, olive-oil, a few\r\nloaves of wheaten bread, and a little dried paste for making soup. The\r\nsoup was made of a few onions, dried peppers, salt, oil, and the paste.\r\nOn first starting, some of the more respectable had a few hard-boiled\r\neggs, with which the Jews most frequently travel; and others had a little\r\npickled fish. When the paste was finished, the barley-meal was attacked,\r\nand when this was gone, the greater part lived on biscuits sopped in\r\nwater. We tried to buy a sheep from a flock driven by the shore, for\r\nwhich I furnished a dollar; but the current was so strong, that the man\r\ncould not reach the land. One poor old Moor lived actually on bread and\r\nwater all the time he was on board, and would have nothing else, telling\r\nme, \"What God gives is enough.\" Yet he was cheerful and talkative. One of\r\nthe two Jews was also a very old blind man, clothed in rags. He, too,\r\nmostly fared on biscuits sopped in water; nevertheless, he also was quite\r\nhappy! \"Where are you going, Abraham?\" I said to him. \"Where God wills I\r\ngo,\" he replied; \"but I wish to lay my poor bones in the land of our\r\nfathers. Many long years God has afflicted us for our sins, but it will\r\nnot be for ever.\" The old gentleman was going to get a passage from\r\nTripoli to the Holy Land. How little suffices some! How much does faith!\r\nSo mysterious are the ways of the Creator in distributing contentment.\r\nFor myself, I fared extremely well in the midst of this _happy_ melée of\r\nmisery and starvation, Mr. Pariente, of Jerbah, having filled for me a\r\nlarge box of provisions, consisting of a leg of lamb, a fowl, pigeons,\r\nfish and bread, besides wine and spirits. But this was as liberally\r\ndistributed amongst all as given to me, and not a crumb was left on\r\narriving at Tripoli. When we were getting safe into port, I gave the grog\r\nto the crew; they had often cast wistful eyes at the _acquavite_, but\r\nnone was poured out whilst at sea. Two or three drunken sailors would\r\nhave sent our cockle-shell to the bottom; still, in spite of the\r\ncoffee-drinking vessels, a little spirits may occasionally be very\r\nusefully distributed to men, fighting and wrestling with the wild waves\r\nand the tempest. Our bark was from six to eight tons' burden, and the\r\ncabin was just big enough for me and the captain to move in; the woman\r\nand child slept in the forecastle, and all the rest on deck. Each Moorish\r\npassenger paid half a dollar for the voyage. I have been thus particular\r\nin describing our coaster and its _live_ freight, to show what misery is\r\nendured in these coasting voyages. It was, however, a fit introduction to\r\nmy painful journeyings through the still more inhospitable _ocean_\r\ndesert.\r\n\r\nI have now to mention my runaway servant, Said. This negro was the slave\r\nof Sidi Mustapha, Consular Agent of France in Jerbah. Mustapha was\r\nformerly Consular Agent of England, and being found to possess slaves, he\r\nwas dismissed. He got up however false documents, to show that he had\r\ndisposed of his slaves; but this being discovered, the cheat did not\r\navail, and he was not allowed to be any longer England's Consul. Then,\r\nseeing his imposture had failed, he again resumed power over his slaves,\r\nand Said was still his slave on my arrival at Jerbah. Hearing of this, I\r\ntold Said to go on board, and wait till the boat left. He did so. The\r\ncaptain winked at it, and apparently every one else, for Said was\r\nsecurely numbered on the vessel's _papers_ as a passenger. This, of\r\ncourse, happened before the Bey of Tunis finally abolished slavery, which\r\nimportant event took place in the beginning of the year 1846, to the\r\neternal honour of the reigning Mussulman prince. But, even if slavery had\r\ncontinued in Tunis, Mustapha, the French Consular Agent in Jerbah, could\r\nhave had no legal right over Said, after having given a document to the\r\nBritish Consul-General, certifying that he had liberated all his slaves.\r\nThe runaway Said was in reality a freed man. The reader, however, will be\r\npleased to understand that I am not justifying my conduct for enticing a\r\nslave to run away. I despise such an attempted justification. On the\r\ncontrary, I consider that every man, who has the means of striking off\r\nthe chains from a slave, and does not embrace the opportunity of doing\r\nso, is the rather the man who commits an offence against natural right.\r\nAs to the French Consular Agent, I asked some people why the French\r\nGovernment did not dismiss him also for his premeditated forgery of\r\npublic documents? I was told that, on the contrary, this was a reason for\r\nkeeping him French Consul--that he could not be _disavowed_ in connexion\r\nwith _British_ affairs, or, if disavowed, he must be pensioned off. A\r\nFrench Consul, whose acquaintance I made in North Africa, replied to me,\r\non rallying him on the various disavowals of French functionaries in\r\ndifferent parts of the world: \"I assure you, the only way to get\r\ndistinction in our consular service is to get disavowed. When disavowed\r\nabout English differences, we must be decorated, or the mob of Paris and\r\nits journals would not be satisfied.\"\r\n\r\nOur captain gave me a hint that, on arriving at Tripoli, there would be\r\nexhibited a good deal of _fantazia_, (\"humbug[10]\") by the health-office\r\ndepartment. Accordingly, after we had been an hour in port, the health\r\nofficer came alongside, and affected great surprise at our not having\r\n_passports_, and asked me, with great pomposity, what was my \"_reverito\r\nnome?_\" The Turks always adopt and caricature the worst parts of European\r\ncivilization, leaving its better forms wholly unimitated. This is,\r\nperhaps, in the nature of the struggles which a semi-barbarous power may\r\nmake to attain the standard of its civilized neighbour.\r\n\r\nOn landing, I went off with Said to the British Consulate. Although I had\r\nseen Colonel Warrington at Malta, I was now so sea-worn and browned with\r\nsun and wind, with an _incipient_ desert beard, that he did not\r\nimmediately recollect me. I therefore presented my letter of\r\nintroduction, mentioning my name, when at once the Colonel recognized me.\r\n\"Ah!\" observed the Colonel, \"I don't believe our Government cares one\r\nstraw about the suppression of the slave-trade, but, Richardson, I\r\nbelieve in you, so let's be off to my garden.\" I rode one of the\r\nColonel's horses, which had been so long in the stable without exercise,\r\nthat I found the Barbary barb no joke. A most violent _gregale_ swept the\r\nbare beach of the harbour as we proceeded to the gardens and plantations\r\nof the Masheeah, and the restive prancing of the horse was not unlike the\r\ndancing about of the cockle-shell bark to which I had been condemned for\r\nthe last ten days. The _British Garden_ I found to be a splendid\r\nhorticultural developement, containing the choicest fruit-trees of North\r\nAfrica, with ornamental trees of every shape, and hue, and foliage--all\r\nthe growth of thirty years, and the greater part of them planted by the\r\nhands of Colonel Warrington himself. The villa is on the site of an\r\nancient haunted house--for what country does not boast of its haunted\r\nhouse? The spot which once was visited nightly by some Saracen's-head\r\nghost, in the midst of a waste, is now the fairest, loveliest garden of\r\nTripoli! Amongst its rich fruit-trees is an immense peach-tree--the\r\nlargest in all this part of Africa. It is a round, squatting,\r\nwide-spreading tree, not nailed up to the walls, but the size of its\r\ngirth of boughs is enormous.\r\n\r\nI must take the liberty of leaving off daily dates here. I detest daily\r\nnote-writing, although the reader may find for his peculiar infliction so\r\nlong a journal as these pages.\r\n\r\n_19th._--A _ghiblee_ day. The wind from The Desert is coming with a\r\nvengeance. Its breath is the pure flame of the furnace. I am obliged to\r\ntie a handkerchief over my face in passing through the verandahs of the\r\ngarden. I had not the least idea it could be so hot here in the middle of\r\nMay. At 2 P.M. the thermometer in the sun was at 142° Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nNeither Tunis nor Tripoli has been sufficiently appreciated by the\r\npoliticians of Europe. Indian and American affairs are the two ideas\r\nwhich occupy our merchants. And yet the best informed of the consuls in\r\nTripoli say, \"The future battles of Europe will be fought in North\r\nAfrica.\" At this time there is considerable agitation and political\r\nintrigue afoot here. Algerian politics, also, envenom these squabbles.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the city of Tripoli is the most miserable of all the towns\r\nI have seen in North Africa. And they say, \"It grows worse and worse.\"\r\nYet the present Pasha, Mehemet, is esteemed as a good and sensible man.\r\nUnfortunately, a Turkish Governor can have very little or no interest in\r\nthe permanent prosperity of this country. His tenure of office is very\r\ninsecure, and rarely extends beyond four or five years; so that whilst\r\nhere he only thinks of providing for himself. The country is therefore in\r\na continual state of impoverishment as governed by successive pashas.\r\nEach successive high functionary works and fleeces the people to the\r\nuttermost. Even in our own colonies the exception is, that the Governor\r\ncares more for the welfare of the colony than for his own immediate\r\nbenefit. In Turkish colonies we must therefore expect the rule to be,\r\nthat the Pasha should govern only for his private benefit and personal\r\naggrandizement.\r\n\r\n_21st._--This afternoon His Highness Mehemet Pasha had arranged to grant\r\nme an interview. I was introduced, of course, by our Consul-General,\r\nColonel Warrington. Mr. Casolaina, the Chancellor of the Consulate, and\r\nhis son, were in attendance as interpreters. His Highness receives all\r\nstrangers and transacts all business in an apartment of the celebrated\r\nold castle of the Karamanly Bashaws, whose legends of blood and intrigue\r\nhave been so vividly and terrifically transcribed in _Tully's Tripoline\r\nLetters_. On entering this place I was astonished at its ruinous and\r\nrepulsive appearance. Nothing could better resemble a prison, and yet a\r\nprison in the most dilapidated condition. Walking through the dark,\r\nwinding, damp, mildewy passages, shedding down upon us a pestiferous\r\ndungeon influence, Colonel Warrington suddenly stopped, as if to breathe\r\nand repel the deadly miasma, and turning to me, said: \"Well, Richardson,\r\nwhat do you think of this? Capital place this for young ladies to dance\r\nin, so light and airy. Many a poor wretch has entered here, with promises\r\nof fortune and royal favour, and has met his doom at the hand of the\r\nassassin! In my long course of service, how many Kaëds and Sheikhs I have\r\nknown, who have come in here and have never gone out. I'm a great reader\r\nof Shakspeare. It's the next book after the Bible. But a thousand\r\nShakspeares, with all their tragic genius, could never describe the\r\npassions which have worked, and the horrors which have been perpetrated,\r\nin this place.\" The Colonel's tragic harangue was not without its effect\r\nin these dungeon passages, and the old gentleman seemed to enjoy the\r\nshiver which he saw involuntarily agitate me. Indeed, the darksome\r\nnoisome atmosphere, without this tragic appeal, could not fail to make\r\nitself felt, as Egyptian darkness was felt, after leaving the fiery heat\r\nand bright dazzling sun-light without. Winding about from one ruinous\r\nroom to another, and ascending various flights of tumbling-down steps and\r\nstairs, we got up at length to the eastern end, where there are two or\r\nthree new apartments constructed in the modern style. In one of them, not\r\nunlike a city merchant's receiving-parlour, we found the Pasha and his\r\ncourt. We were immediately introduced, and somewhat to my surprise, I\r\nfound His Highness an extremely plain _unmilitary_-looking Turkish\r\ngentleman, of about fifty years of age, and dressed without the least\r\npretensions of any kind. How unlike the ancient gemmed and jewelled\r\nBashaws! flaming in \"Barbaric pearl and gold.\" The present Ottoman\r\ncostume is most simple. His Highness had only the _Nisham_, or Turkish\r\ndecoration of brilliants upon his breast, to distinguish him from his own\r\ndomestics, coffee-bearers, or others. As soon as he saw us, he hurriedly\r\ncame up to us and seized hold of our hands and shook them cordially. The\r\ntroops were at the moment being reviewed, and we had a good sight of them\r\nfrom our elevated position. They were manœuvring on the sea-beach between\r\nthe city and the Masheeah. \"Tell the Bashaw,\" cried out the Colonel to\r\nCasolaina, \"I never saw such splendid manœuvring in all the course of my\r\nlife. They do His Highness and Ahmed Bashaw, the Commander-in-Chief,\r\ninfinite credit.\" This compliment was interpreted and graciously\r\nreceived though its value was no doubt properly appreciated by the\r\npolitic Turk. The Colonel continued:--\"Tell the Bashaw, that as long as\r\nthe Sultan has such troops as these, he will be invincible.\" This was\r\nanswered by, \"_Enshallah_, _enshallah_, (If God pleases, if God\r\npleases)\". The Colonel still laid it on:--\"Casolaina, tell the Bashaw, I\r\nmyself should not like to command even English troops against these fine\r\nfellows.\" To which the Bashaw and his Court replied, \"_Ajeeb_,\r\n(Wonderful!)\" Ahmed Bashaw, the Commander-in-Chief, a most\r\nferocious-looking Turk, seized hold of my shoulders and pushed me to the\r\nwindow to admire his brilliant men. I could just see that their\r\nmanœuvrings were in the style of the \"awkward squad;\" but their arms and\r\nwhite pantaloons dazzled beautifully in the sun upon the margin of the\r\ndeep-blue sea.\r\n\r\nAfter we had satisfied our curiosity or admiration in looking at the\r\ntroops, the windows were shut down, and all sat down to business. His\r\nHighness began by asking my name, when I came, and what I was going to be\r\nabout? The Consul replied to these first and usual questions of Turkish\r\nfunctionaries, and more particularly explained my projected visit to\r\nGhadames. The Pasha immediately consented, as a matter of course, with\r\nTurkish politeness; but before the interview was concluded, various\r\nobjections were started and insisted upon, showing the _not_ suddenly\r\nexcited jealousy of these functionaries, who, previous to my interview,\r\nknew all about my anti-slavery and literary projects. His Highness\r\nobserved:--\"The heat is killing now, the distance is great, the road is\r\ninfested with robbers; I shall have to send an escort of five hundred\r\ntroops with your friend, (addressing the Consul); not long ago two\r\nhundred banditti attacked a caravan. All Tunisian Arabs are robbers; the\r\nBey of that country cannot maintain order in his country; besides, an\r\nArab will kill ten men to get one pair of pistols; but I'll make further\r\ninquiries.\" His Highness also related a feat of his own troops, who\r\ncaptured seven camels from the banditti, which he said he distributed\r\namongst the captors. He also gave his own people, the Tripolines, a very\r\nbad character. But, of course, the Tripolines and the Turks must mutually\r\nhate one another. We were served with pipes, coffee, and sherbet. I\r\npretended to sip the pipe two or three times, as a matter of politeness,\r\nfor though I have been in Barbary some time, where smoking is universal,\r\nI have not adopted the dirty vice. Near the Pasha sat the second in\r\ncommand, or Commander-in-Chief of the forces, the Pasha himself devoting\r\nhis attention almost exclusively to civil affairs. As I have said, this\r\nfunctionary was a most savage-looking fellow, and his acts in Tripoli and\r\nhis reputation accord with the character broadly stamped on his\r\ncountenance. He has risen from the lowest ranks--one of the _canaille_ of\r\nthe Levant--and is blood-thirsty and vindictive whenever he has the means\r\nof showing these dreadful passions. How many tyrants have risen from the\r\nranks of those who are the victims and objects of tyranny!\r\n\r\nThe Consul hinted to me afterwards, that this military tyrant would\r\noppose my journey to the interior, and throw all sorts of obstacles in\r\nthe way, but thought the Pasha would not listen to his insinuations. On\r\nasking the Consul what he thought of the objections of the Pasha? he\r\nsaid: \"Oh, they are only to increase the merit of his facilitating your\r\ntrip.\" Mehemet Pasha has the rank of three tails, and the Pasha of the\r\nTroops two tails. There was present also Mohammed Aly, a Moor, who\r\ninterprets between the Moors and Arabs, and the Turks. He is said to be\r\nentirely in the interest of the English. He frequently visits the\r\nVice-Consul, Mr. Herbert Warrington, who treats the interpreter with a\r\nbottle of champaigne, and in this way things are greatly smoothed down\r\nbefore His Highness. A glass of wine is often more potent than an\r\nelaborate speech in these and other diplomatic transactions. It is but\r\njustice to these functionaries to say, whatever money they may take away\r\nfrom Tripoli, that they are very moderate in their style of living and\r\ndress in this place. The apartment in which we were received was\r\nexceedingly plain. All the furniture was of the most ordinary European\r\nstuff; there was nothing oriental in it but a large square ottoman. A few\r\nflowers were placed gracefully on the table, and there was a pretty\r\nbronzed lamp. We visitors sat on cane-bottomed chairs. The costume of\r\nthese high functionaries was the usual large Turkish frock-coat, tightly\r\nbuttoned up, and white or other light-coloured pantaloons, for summer\r\nwear, and these strapped over thick heavy black leather shoes, the straps\r\noften inside the shoes as an Ottoman improvement on the European fashion.\r\nThe head was covered with the _shasheeah_, or fez, with a large blue silk\r\ntassel hanging prettily from the crown. On the breast hung the _Nisham_\r\ndecoration, distinguishing the various grades and rank.\r\n\r\nWe left His Highness under the impression that he would do every thing in\r\nhis power to forward our views, and never dreamt of a future memorandum\r\nof recall after having reached Ghadames with His Highness's permission.\r\n\r\nIt is not now my intention to give an account of Tripoli, so I pass on to\r\na second interview I had with the Bashaw. This was on the 7th of July. In\r\nthis long interval, I had been waiting for letters from England, and in\r\nevery way was learning lessons of most imperturbable patience.\r\n\r\nI was visiting some sick officers in the castle with a Maltese doctor of\r\nthe name of _Gameo_, whose acquaintance I had made, and whom I found\r\nuseful in collecting information on Tripoli and the interior, when one of\r\nthe functionaries of the Castle came to tell me the Bashaw would like to\r\nsee me. I felt some delicacy in going, but thought it better to comply\r\nwith the wish of His Highness. There was immediately presented to me, as\r\nusual to all visitors, a pipe, coffee, and sherbet. Our interview lasted\r\nabout half an hour, and the conversation was _to the point_, referring\r\nsolely to my journey to the interior. But, although I exerted all my\r\nskill and tact, I could not remove the jealousies of His Highness, and I\r\nbelieve for one, and only one reason. It had been given out in Tripoli\r\nthat I was to be appointed Consul at Ghadames. The Bashaw fearing that\r\nsuch an appointment would interfere with his system of extorting money\r\nfrom the inhabitants of that country (the treasury being empty in\r\nTripoli), set his face against my journey, and endeavoured to delay it\r\nuntil he could get a _counter_ order from Constantinople. His Highness\r\nwas however very polite, and promised to furnish me with tents, if I had\r\nneed, and a large escort. The Turks are getting sensitive of the press.\r\nThe Bashaw said he had heard I was a great newspaper writer, and asked me\r\nif I had any objection to writing an article in his praise.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the month of July (30th), Colonel Warrington suggested to\r\nme the propriety of writing to him a letter, stating my wish and objects\r\nin visiting the interior. I did so, and received an answer from the\r\nColonel the same day. Mr. Frederick Warrington, who had great influence\r\nwith several people about His Highness, and myself, went again to the\r\nBashaw, in order to conciliate His Highness and persuade him to give a\r\n_bonâ fide_ protection to me through the interior of Tripoli, as also to\r\nobtain a passport. It unfortunately happened, that about a week ago, a\r\nGhadames caravan had been captured by some hostile Arabs on the frontiers\r\nof Tunis. His Highness immediately produced this case, and said it was\r\nimpossible for me to go whilst the routes were so insecure. He also\r\nalleged, and with more reason:--\"The season was now too late, the heat\r\nwas intolerable, and an European of my delicate constitution must\r\nsuccumb.\" We therefore returned much depressed. Colonel Warrington then,\r\nannoyed at the Bashaw's resistance, wrote the next day a letter to his\r\nChancellor, requesting him to wait upon the Bashaw, and demand formally a\r\npassport for me, my servant, and camel-driver. I went with Mr. Casolaina,\r\nbut did not see His Highness, waiting only at the door of the hall of\r\naudience, in case I should be wanted. His Highness apologized for his\r\nopposition, stating his objections of the season and the insecurity of\r\nthe routes, but gave the order for the passports. I find the following\r\nnote in my journal:--\"Left Tripoli for Ghadames on the 2nd August, 1845;\r\nI had grown completely tired of Tripoli, and left it without a single\r\nregret, having suffered much from several sources of annoyance, including\r\nboth the Consulate and the Bashaw.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Many newspaper articles have been written, and companies\r\n    formed, for the promotion of exploring for sulphur in Tripoli (the\r\n    Syrtis); but somehow or other, all these schemes have failed. I\r\n    have been told there is sulphur in the Syrtis, and the failure of\r\n    obtaining it in remunerative quantity is to be attributed alone to\r\n    the chicanery or want of skill in the agent.\r\n\r\n[7] There is a far greater ebb and flow of tide here than at any\r\n    other coast of the Mediterranean, the sea rising and falling no\r\n    less than ten feet. This tidal phenomenon extends to the Lesser\r\n    Syrtis and to Sfax.\r\n\r\n[8] Like the fish-lakes of Biserta in Tunis, these salt-pits were\r\n    worked by the ancients, and have been inexhaustible and\r\n    unchangeable through two thousand years. Whatever may be the\r\n    geological changes in other regions of the globe, those of North\r\n    Africa are not very rapid, beyond filling up a few of the\r\n    artificial harbours, or _cothons_, with mud. Barbary contains\r\n    several Roman bridges which have spanned a stream remaining the\r\n    same size, and running in the same bed, through a course of\r\n    centuries. The salt of the _Salinæ_ is of good quality.\r\n\r\n[9] _Bismillah_, \"In the name of God,\" the formula used by Moslems\r\n    when they partake of food. In the _Lingua Franca_ we have\r\n    sometimes \"_Avete_ bismillah?\" or \"bismillah_ato_?\" that is,\r\n    \"taken your meal?\"\r\n\r\n[10] In the present application, for this _Lingua Franca_ word\r\n    generally means \"vain silly shewing off.\" The \"playing at powder,\"\r\n    or \"firing off matchlocks for amusement,\" is also called a\r\n    _fantazia_ in Algeria and Morocco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nFROM TRIPOLI TO THE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n     Leave Tripoli for the Interior.--Feelings on\r\n     Starting.--Ghargash.--Gameo, the great quack of\r\n     Tripoli.--Janzour.--Account of my Equipment.--Camels fond of the\r\n     Cactus.--Arab Tents.--Jedaeen.--Zouweeah.--The\r\n     Sahara.--Beer-el-Hamra.--Squabbling at the Wells.--The strength\r\n     of Caravan, and character of Escort.--Shouwabeeah.--Difficulty of\r\n     keeping the Caravan together.--Camels cropping herbage _en\r\n     route_.--The _Kailah_ or _Siesta_.--Arab Troops seize the Water\r\n     of the Merchants.--Wady Lethel.--Irregular March of the\r\n     Caravan.--Aâeeat.--Descent into Wells.--Learn the value of\r\n     Water.--The Atlas and its Tripoline divisions and\r\n     subdivisions.--The ascent of Yefran, and its Castle.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTHING is more common than that, after long delay and various\r\nnegotiations, in waiting and preparing for a journey, everything at last\r\nis hurried with a most reckless dispatch; this, at least, was the case\r\nwith me. I was to have been escorted out of Tripoli by the Consular\r\ncorps, with the British Consul at their head, in the wonted style of\r\nEuropeans setting out for the interior. But on the morning of the 2nd\r\nAugust, before I could finish my letters for England, or get my luggage\r\ntogether, came my camel-driver Mohammed, who, at the sight of my papers\r\nall spread out, began whining and blubbering, protesting, \"The\r\n_ghafalah_[11] is gone; we can't overtake it--we shall be murdered, if we\r\ndelay behind.\" Without saying a word in reply, I amassed and bundled up\r\neverything together, and gave him the baggage; then went off to the\r\n_Souk_, or market-place, to buy some fresh bread,--and found myself on\r\nthe way to Ghadames, before I was conscious of having left Tripoli. Such\r\nis the excitement and vagaries of human feeling! Not being accustomed to\r\nmount the camel, I determined to hire some donkeys to ride to the first\r\nstation; Gameo and one of his brothers accompanied me. When I could\r\nbreathe freely, as I rode on my unknown way, with a boundless prospect\r\nbefore me, I felt my heart rebound with joy, and commended myself humbly\r\nto the care of a good God, not knowing what was to happen to me. I had\r\nconsumed three months of most suffering patience in Tripoli before I\r\ncould start on this journey, and was otherwise schooled for what was\r\nabout to take place. But I must not begin too early the record of my\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nOur first day's ride was mostly through desert lands, for The Desert\r\nreaches to the walls of the city of Tripoli. The little village of\r\nGargash was seen at our right, near the margin of the sea. Gameo\r\nexclaimed, \"There's the little mosque--there's the little cemetery--there\r\nare the little gardens, little palms!\"--and little this, and little the\r\nother: indeed, it was a perfect miniature of congregated human existence.\r\nArrived at Janzour, Gameo and his brother prepared to return. But\r\nprevious to his leaving, Gameo, who was a tabeeb of great notoriety,\r\ndetermined to display his healing art. He took out his lancet, and\r\nforthwith bled everybody in the Kaëd's caravanseria. When his brother\r\nbegged of him not to bleed any more people unless they paid him\r\nsomething--not to be such a _sciocco_ (\"ninny,\") he turned round upon\r\nhim, and indignantly exclaimed \"Ancora voglio lasciare il mio nome qui\"\r\n(Here I will leave my name also!) It was the delight of Gameo to be the\r\ngrand tabeeb of Tripoli, and even to prescribe for the officers and\r\nsubordinate bashaws; and yet Gameo and his family many days were without\r\nbread to eat, to my certain knowledge. I relieved them as much as I\r\ncould. The Moors and Arabs are very funny about bleeding, and the matters\r\nof the tabeeb; they will ask you to bleed them when in perfect health.\r\nAll these persons who were bled at Janzour had no ailments; they will\r\nalso swallow physic, whether well or ill. One of them consulted Gameo\r\nprivately how he was to obtain children from his wife, who was barren.\r\nAnother wished to obtain the affections of a girl by administering to her\r\na dose of medicine. They consider a doctor in the light, in which our\r\nfathers of the time of Friar Bacon did, of a magician, and a person who\r\nholds some sort of illicit intercourse with the devil, or, at any rate,\r\nwith the genii. They never give the doctor credit for his skill, but\r\nattribute his wit and success to the blessing or interposition of God.\r\n\r\nAfter taking leave of Gameo, I waited for Mohammed and Said; we had gone\r\non quickly with the donkeys. They came up with the camels, but instead of\r\nencamping within the village, the ghafalah had brought up outside. This\r\nannoyed Mohammed, who kept exclaiming, as we went to the rendezvous of\r\nthe merchants, \"Ah! Gameo, that's him, Gameo, Gameo! What trouble he has\r\nbrought upon us, Gameo! Gameo! he a tabeeb? Not fit to give physic to a\r\ndog. Gameo! Gameo! always talking--always talking; the devil take him,\r\nfor he's his son.\" We reached the encampment as the shadows of night\r\nfell fast; we did not take supper, or pitch tent. My spirits gave way,\r\nand I felt fearful and saddened at the prospect of going into the\r\ninterior absolutely alone. I had not a single letter of recommendation to\r\nany one, after waiting so long at Tripoli, and so much talk with all\r\nsorts of people about the necessity of having letters for the chiefs of\r\nThe Desert. This was, indeed, bad management; yet I could not insist upon\r\nthe Pasha giving me a letter, nor could I importune the British Consul:\r\nbut it often happens, where there is less help from man, there is more\r\nfrom God. Many of the Ghadamsee merchants, whose acquaintance I had made\r\nin Tripoli, came now to me and welcomed me as a fellow-traveller. Janzour\r\nis a small village, with gardens of olives and date plantations.\r\n\r\n_August 3rd._--Before starting to-day, it is necessary to give some\r\naccount of my equipment. I had two camels on hire, for which I paid\r\ntwelve dollars. I was to ride one continually. We had panniers on it, in\r\nwhich I stowed away about two months' provisions. A little fresh\r\nprovision we were to purchase _en route_. Upon these panniers a mattress\r\nwas placed, forming with them a comfortable platform. As a luxury, I had\r\na Moorish pillow for leaning on, given me by Mr. Frederick Warrington.\r\nThe camel was neither led nor reined, but followed the group. I myself\r\nwas dressed in light European clothes, and furnished with an umbrella for\r\nkeeping off the sun. This latter was all my arms of offence and defence.\r\nThe other camel carried a trunk and some small boxes, cooking utensils,\r\nand matting, and a very light tent for keeping off sun and heat. We had\r\ntwo gurbahs, or \"skin-bags for water,\" and another we were to buy in the\r\nmountains, so each having a skin of water to himself. Said was to ride\r\nthis camel, and now and then give a ride to Mohammed the camel-driver, to\r\nwhom the camels belonged. We were roused before daylight. I made coffee\r\nwith my spirit apparatus (_spiriterio_). In half an hour after the dawn,\r\nwe were all on the move, and soon started. The ghafalah presented an\r\ninterminable line of camels, as it wound its slow way through narrow\r\nsandy lanes, hedged on each side with the cactus or prickly-pear. We\r\nprogressed very irregularly, and the camels kept throwing off their\r\nburdens. The Moors and Arabs, who manage almost everything badly, even\r\nhardly know how to manage their camels, after ages of experience. It is,\r\nhowever, very difficult to drive the camels past a prickly-pear hedge,\r\nthey being voraciously fond of the huge succulent leaves of this plant,\r\nand crop them with the most savage greediness, regardless of the\r\ncontinual blows, accompanied with loud shouts, which they receive from\r\nthe vociferous drivers to get them forward. I wore my cloak for two hours\r\nafter dawn, and felt chilly, and yet at noonday the thermometer was at\r\nleast 130° Fah., in the sun. We emerged from the prickly-pear hedges upon\r\nan open desert land. Here was an encampment of Arabs, with tents as\r\n\"black\" and \"comely\" in this glare and fire of the full morning sun, as\r\n\"the tents of Kedar!\" (See Solomon's Songs i. 5.) Nothing indeed is more\r\nrefreshing than the sight of these black camel's-hair tents, when\r\ntravelling over these arid thirsty plains. The whole households of the\r\ntents were alive, but their various occupations will be seen better in\r\nthe following sketch than pictured to the mind by any elaborate\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEncamped at Jedaeem about 10 o'clock, A.M. Remained here only two hours\r\nand proceeded to Zouweeah, a large village, situate in the midst of most\r\npleasant gardens, or rather cultivated lands, overshadowed with date\r\ngroves. These gardens are considered superior to those of the Masheeah\r\naround Tripoli. Passed through the whole district by 3 P.M., and then\r\nentered what is usually called the Sahara, this side the Mountains. This\r\ndesert presents sand hills, loose stones scattered about, dwarf shrubs,\r\nlong coarse grass, and sometimes small undulations of rocky ground. It\r\nis, however, overrun by a few nomade tribes, who feed their flocks on the\r\nungrateful and scant herbage which it affords. Tripoli, in general offers\r\na remarkable contrast to Tunis and other parts of Barbary, in having its\r\nArab tribes located in stone and mud houses or fixed douwars, whilst\r\nnomade Arabs are found thickly scattered all over the West, as far as the\r\nAtlantic. Zouweeah is the last _belad_, or _paesi_, (_i. e._,\r\n\"cultivated country,\") before we reach The Mountains, which are two\r\ndays' journey distant. I therefore sent Mohammed to buy a small sheep,\r\nbut he could not succeed although there were many flocks about, the\r\npeople absurdly refusing to sell them, even when the full price was\r\noffered. The Arabs themselves never eat meat as the rule, but the\r\nexception, supporting themselves on the milk of their flocks and\r\nfarinaceous matter. Olive-oil and fat and fruit they devour. Of\r\nvegetables they eat, but with little _gusto_. Their flocks are kept as a\r\nsort of reserve wealth, and to pay their contributions. Our course to-day\r\nand yesterday was west and south-west. At sunset we encamped at\r\nBeer-el-Hamra (\"red-well\"), which is a well-spring of very good water,\r\nten feet deep, the water issuing from the sides of the rocky soil. Here\r\nwe found artificial pits or troughs for the sheep and cattle to drink\r\nfrom, and trunks of the date-palms hollowed out for the camels. When a\r\nghafalah passes a well there is the greatest confusion to get all the\r\ncamels to drink, and the people quarrel and fight about this, as well as\r\nfor their turn to fill their water-skins. This quarrelling at the wells\r\nforcibly reminds the Biblical reader of the contest of Moses in favour of\r\nthe daughters of Jethro against the ungallant shepherds. (Exodus i. 17.)\r\nWe take in no more water till we get to The Mountains.\r\n\r\nHere mention must be made of the strength of our caravan, as all are to\r\nrendezvous at this well for safety, to start together over The Desert to\r\nThe Mountains. It was half a day's advance of this where the Ghadamsee\r\nghafalah had been lately plundered of all its goods and camels. As soon\r\nas the Sebâah banditti appeared, the merchants, who were without escort,\r\nall ran away like frightened gazelles. One man alone had his arm\r\nscratched. Our ghafalah, besides casual travellers going to The\r\nMountains, consisted of some two hundred camels, laden chiefly with\r\nmerchandize for the interior, Soudan, and Timbuctoo. Thirty or forty\r\nmerchants, nearly all of Ghadames, to whom the goods belong, accompany\r\nthese camels. To ascertain its value would be hopeless, for the\r\nmerchants, with the real jealousy of mercantile rivalry, conceal their\r\naffairs from one another. Two of the principal Ghadamsee merchants are\r\nwith us, the Sheikh Makouran and Haj Mansour, besides a son of the great\r\nhouse of Ettence. These merchants belong to the rival factions of the\r\ncity, and accordingly have separate encampments. The greater number of\r\nthe merchants of our ghafalah are only petty traders, some with only a\r\ncamel-load of merchandize. We are escorted by sixty Arab troops on foot,\r\nwith a commandant and some subordinate sheikhs on horseback. They are to\r\nprotect us to The Mountains, where it is said all danger ends. They are\r\npoor, miserable devils to look at, hungry, lank, lean, and browned to\r\nblackness, armed with matchlocks, which continually miss fire, and\r\ncovered with rags, or mostly having only a single blanket to cover their\r\ndirty and emaciated bodies. Some are without shoes, and others have a\r\npiece of camel's skin cut in the shape of a sole of the foot, and tied up\r\nround the ankles: some have a scull-cap, white or red, and others are\r\nbare-headed. I laughed when I surveyed with my inexperienced eye these\r\ngrisly, skeleton, phantom troops, and thought of the splendid invincible\r\nguard which the Pasha promised me. And yet amongst these wretched beings\r\nwas riding sublime an Arab Falstaff.\r\n\r\n_4th._--Morning. Find the greater part of the ghafalah has not yet come\r\nup. We are to wait for them, being the advanced body. Expect them in the\r\nafternoon. It is exceedingly difficult to keep these various groups of\r\nmerchants together; each group is its own sovereign master and will have\r\nits own way. The commandant is constantly swearing at each party to get\r\nall to march together; now and then he draws his sword and shakes it over\r\ntheir heads. \"You are dogs,\" he says to one; \"you are worse than this\r\nChristian Kafer amongst us,\" (myself,) he bawls to another.\r\n\r\nHave, thank God, suffered little up to now, although intensely hot in the\r\nday-time, and my eyes so bad that I cannot look at the sun, and scarcely\r\non daylight without a shade. They were bad on leaving Tripoli, having\r\ncaught a severe ophthalmia from the refraction of the hot rocks when\r\nbathing. My left arm is also still very weak, from the accident of\r\nfalling into a dry well a little before I started. I can't mount the\r\ncamel without assistance, but begin to ride without that sickly\r\nsensation, not unlike sea-sickness, which I felt the first day's riding.\r\nDrink brandy frequently, but in small quantities and greatly diluted, and\r\nfind great benefit from it; drink also coffee and tea. Eat but little,\r\nand scarcely any meat. The Arabs of the country brought a few sheep to\r\nsell this morning, but asked double the Tripoli price; so nobody\r\npurchased. Bought myself a fowl for eighty Turkish paras. The people of\r\nthe ghafalah civil, but all the lower classes will beg continually if you\r\nare willing to give. Each one offers his advice and consolation on my\r\ntour; but Mohammed keeps all the hungry Arabs at a respectable distance,\r\nlest I should give to them what belongs to his share, like servants who\r\ndon't wish their masters to be generous to others if it interferes with\r\ntheir own prerogatives.\r\n\r\nWe left in the afternoon and encamped in The Desert at Shouwabeeah. The\r\nDesert here presents nothing but long coarse grass and undulating ground.\r\nI observed a patch which had been cultivated, the stubble of barley\r\nremaining, which the camels devoured most voraciously. Chopped\r\nbarley-straw is the favourite food of all animals of burden in North\r\nAfrica; horses will feed on it for six months together, and get fat. _En\r\nroute_ the chief of the escort had great trouble to keep the caravan\r\ntogether; he made the advanced parties wait till the others came up, so\r\nas all to be ready in case of attack. One would think the merchants, for\r\ntheir own sakes, would keep together; but no, it's all _maktoub_ with\r\nthem; \"If they are to be robbed and murdered they must be robbed and\r\nmurdered, and the Bashaw and all his troops can't prevent it.\" This they\r\nreiterated to me whilst the commandant bullied them; and yet these same\r\nmen had each of them a matchlock and pistols besides. The Sheikh Makouran\r\nhad no less than four guns on his camel. I asked him what they were for.\r\nHe coolly replied, \"I don't know. God knows.\" The camels browse or crop\r\nherbage all the way along, daintily picking and choosing the herbage and\r\nshrubs which they like best. My chief occupation in riding is watching\r\nthem browse, and observing the epicurean fancies of these reflective,\r\nsober-thinking brutes of The Desert. I observe also as a happy trait in\r\nthe Arab, that nothing delights him more than watching his own faithful\r\ncamel graze. The ordinary drivers sometimes allow them to graze, and\r\nwait till they have cropped their favourite herbage and shrubs, and at\r\nother times push them forward according to their caprice. The camel, with\r\nan intuitive perception, knows all the edible and delicate herbs and\r\nshrubs of The Desert, and when he finds one of his choicest it is\r\ndifficult to get him on until he has cropped a good mouthful. But I shall\r\nhave much to write of this sentient \"ship of The Desert.\" It is hard to\r\nforget the ship which carries one safely over the ocean, whose plank\r\nintervenes between our life and a bottomless grave of waters: so we\r\ntourists of The Desert acquire a peculiar affection for the melancholy\r\nanimal, whose slow but faithful step carries us through the hideous\r\nwastes of sand and stone, where all life is extinct, and where, if left a\r\nmoment behind the camel's track, certain death follows.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Rose at daybreak, and pursued our way through the Desert. Saw the\r\nmountains early, stretching far away east and west in undefined and shadowy\r\nbut glorious magnificence,--some of deep black hue, and others reddened\r\nover with the morning sunbeams. It is a gladdening, elevating sight. The\r\npresence of a vast range of mountains always raises the mind and\r\nimagination of man. Encamped during the _Kailah_ ‮قايلة‬, or from\r\n10 o'clock A.M., to 3 P.M. This is the siesta of the Spaniards, and it is\r\nprobable the Moors introduced it into Spain. It is also the mezzogiorno\r\nof the Italians and the Frank population of Barbary. But the Italians\r\nusually dine before they take their midday nap. Our object here is to\r\nshelter ourselves from the greatest force of the heat of the day. None of\r\nus dine. In the afternoon the Arab soldiers, being without water, began\r\nto seize that of the merchants, after having demanded it from them in\r\nvain. In one case they robbed a merchant under the pretext of getting\r\nwater. They also attempted to take water from my camels, but I resisted,\r\nthreatening to report them to the Bashaw. After a scuffle with my negro\r\nservant and camel-driver, in which affair Said drew out manfully from the\r\nscabbard the old rusty sword which I presented to him on leaving\r\nTripoli--to gird round him as a warrior badge--they desisted and\r\nretreated. The sub-officer of the escort came up to me afterwards, and\r\nbegged that I would say nothing about the business. I gave him a suck of\r\nbrandy-and-water, and we were mighty good friends all the way. Our course\r\nwas south to-day, striking directly at The Mountains. We encamped about\r\nmidnight at the Wady Lethel, the name of which is derived from the tree\r\n_Lethel_ ‮لذل‬, frequent in the Sahara.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the conduct of the poor Arab soldiers, justice requires it\r\nto be said, that they are allowed nothing for the service of the escort,\r\nwhilst if they do not serve when they are called upon, they are fined.\r\nThe consequence is, they generally have nothing to eat, and no skins to\r\nput their water in. Perhaps a camel with a couple of skins is allowed to\r\ntwenty men. As there was water for scarcely two days of our slow\r\nmarching, (we only march about twelve hours per day,) these miserable\r\nvictims of Turkish rule had no water left. It is hunger and misery in\r\nthis, as in most cases amongst the poor, and not the native unwillingness\r\nof the heart to perform good actions, which excite them to deeds of\r\nviolence and plunder. This night the heavens presented an appearance of\r\nunexampled serenity and soft splendour; all the constellations glowed\r\nwith a steady beauteous light; there were the \"sweet influences of\r\nPleiades,\" the bright \"bands of Orion,\" \"Arcturus with his sons,\" and the\r\ninfinitude of sparkling jewels in \"chambers of the South.\" All the stars\r\nmight be seen and counted, so distinctly visible were they to the naked\r\nunassisted eye. In encamping our ghafalah carried on its delightful\r\nsystem of confusion, and the night fires of the various groups glared\r\nwildly in every direction. I had not yet become familiar with these\r\nnocturnal lights of Saharan travelling, and my senses were confounded. I\r\nfelt tormented as with an enchanter's delusive fire-works in some\r\nhalf-waking dream.\r\n\r\n_6th._--Rose at day-break. Our route was now over a vast level plain, and\r\nwe were within four hours of The Mountains. They now discovered the true\r\nAtlas features, a part of which chain they were. We marched in the most\r\nglorious disorder. Some were before, some behind, straggling along,\r\nothers far to the right, and others as far to the left, a mile or two\r\napart. We had the appearance of an immense line moving on to invest The\r\nMountains _en masse_, for there seemed to be no common point to which we\r\nwere advancing in such tumultuous array. The Arabs pay little attention\r\nto marching in order, and in a straight line, so that the camels traverse\r\ndouble the quantity of ground that there would be any occasion for did\r\nthey attend to plain common sense. The Desert now showed more signs of\r\ncultivation, and, indeed, a great portion of this so-called Desert is\r\nonly land uncultivated, but capable of the highest degree of\r\ncultivation;--all which might be effected by supplying any scarcity of\r\nrain by irrigation.\r\n\r\nWe passed the kailah, or in Scripture phrase, \"the heat of the day,\" at a\r\nplace called Aâeeat, below The Mountains, where we found two wells\r\nwithout water, or with very little bad, dirty, nay, black water.\r\nNevertheless, many descended these wells, about thirty feet deep, to\r\nbring up the muddy filthy water, and swallowed it immediately. I myself\r\nwas so thirsty, that I drank it greedily. Said had very severe thirst,\r\nand I believe he drank in one of the last two days nearly a bucket and a\r\nhalf of water. I finished two bottles of brandy, having diluted it with\r\nlarge quantities of water. I believe this was the only thing which kept\r\nme alive, the heat was so intense and prostrating in the day-time. I am\r\nastonished to see these people descend into the wells with such facility.\r\nI expected, on the contrary, to see them break their necks. They descend\r\nby the sides, only assisted by their hands and feet, clinging to naked\r\nstones, the interstices of which in some places not even allowing space\r\non which to rest the foot. Here again is hubbub and vociferation of the\r\nwildest form, all sorts of quarrelling over this sewer-like water. I now,\r\nfor the first time in my life, experienced the real value of water, and\r\nin these climates more clearly understood the vivid and frequent\r\nallusions in the Holy Scriptures to this essential element of existence.\r\nMohammed went several miles in The Mountains, and returned with a skin of\r\nfresh water. In his absence the torment of thirst prostrated me, and I\r\nlay senseless on the ground:\r\n\r\n    \"The water! the water!\r\n      My heart yet burns to think,\r\n    How cool thy fountain sparkled forth,\r\n      For parched lips to drink.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Kailah, we ascended that portion of the Tripoline chain of the\r\nAtlas called Yefran. This chain has various names, according to its\r\ndifferent links, or groups, more properly, for the usual phenomena of the\r\nAtlas are groups, pile upon pile. The following are some of the principal\r\nnames of this part of the Atlas, beginning east and proceeding west:\r\nGharian, Kiklah, Yefran or _Jibel_, (\"Mountain,\" par excellence,)\r\nNouwaheeha, Khalaeefah, Reeaneen, Zantan, Rujban, Douweerat. All these\r\nlarger districts are divided into smaller ones, descending to very minute\r\nsubdivisions. Every dell, and copse, and glade, and brook, and stream,\r\nand drain, (to use English nomenclature,) of these mountains, is defined,\r\nand owned, and cultivated, as the most cultivated, divided, and\r\nsubdivided estate in England. It is quite ridiculous to look upon the\r\nAtlas chains as so many vast uninhabited wastes. The French, whose forte\r\nin colonization is blundering, rushed into the plateaus and groups of the\r\nAtlas as into lands unowned and undefined, and were quite astonished to\r\nhear of claimants for their newly acquired lands and farms. They imagined\r\nthat the plains of the Metidjah and the adjacent Atlas chain had lain\r\ndesolate since the Creation, or were only wandered over by savage hordes\r\nof barbarians.\r\n\r\nWe found the ascent of Yefran difficult. The Arabs call all places\r\ndifficult of traverse, Wâr--‮وعر‬--whether applied to stony rocky\r\nground, sandy regions, or mountains. The camels in the ascent are timid,\r\nand besides the evident fatigue which they experience, show great caution,\r\npicking slowly their way with the greatest circumspection. Only a portion\r\nof the ghafalah got up to-day. Some camels were labouring up the mountain\r\nsides, others threw off their burdens and stood still. As our party was\r\nalways the advanced, we managed to get up soon. Beneath a huge old black\r\nolive-tree, which seemed to have begun with Creation, but still as\r\nvigorous as ever, we found a comfortable shade in a snug retired place.\r\nIt was cooler on the top of The Mountains, and I took a walk in the\r\nevening to the Castle (Kesar) of Yefran, a most formidable thing to look\r\nat from a distance, but a wretched mud-built place in reality. To the\r\nArabs, however, it is a terrible bulwark of strength, and for them\r\nimpregnable. Everything in the shape of a fort or a blockhouse, be it\r\never so untenable or miserable, terrifies the Arabs. It is repeatedly\r\nasserted that the Arabs of Algeria never took a blockhouse. An authentic\r\nanecdote was recently related to me of a French civilian keeping a whole\r\ntribe in check for two days, by fortifying his house and firing from\r\nloop-holes which he made in its walls. Not so the Kabyles. Their genius\r\nis defending their little forts, often constructed of loose stones, in\r\ntheir mountain homes. Behind these and other forts of nature they\r\nmaintain for days an obstinate resistance, and pour deadly mitraille. The\r\nTurkish soldiers were here lounging about; they gaped and stared at me. I\r\nam, perhaps, the first European who has been to Yefran in the memory of\r\nthe present generation, nay, the first European Christian who has visited\r\nthis spot. The sun now set fiery red, and night was fast veiling The\r\nMountains with her sable curtain. I retired to my olive-tree, and under\r\nits shade slept most profoundly. This was repose--this, sleep! I shall\r\nnever sleep in more profound slumbers until I sleep my last.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Ghafalah, ‮قفله‬, is the ordinary term for a caravan in North\r\n     Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFROM THE MOUNTAINS TO GHADAMES.\r\n\r\n     Interview with the Commandant of The Mountains.--Military\r\n     Position occupied by the Turks.--Subjugation of the Arabs.--My\r\n     different Appellations.--Departure for, and arrival at, Rujban,\r\n     native place of my Camel-driver.--Aspect of The\r\n     Mountains.--Miserable condition of the Inhabitants.--Cruelty of\r\n     the Tribute Collectors.--Marabouts exempt.--Curiosity of the\r\n     Women to see The Christian.--Social Habits of the\r\n     People.--Politics in The Mountains.--Visit from The\r\n     Sheikh.--Various Conversations and Visitors.--Heat of the\r\n     Weather.--The Sheikh offers to sell me his Authority.--Want of\r\n     Rain.--Population.--The playing with the Head.--Pervading\r\n     principle of Religion.--The Sheikh in a bad humour, and misery of\r\n     Life in The Mountains.--Departure from The\r\n     Mountains.--Description of the four days' journey from The\r\n     Mountains to the Oasis of Senawan.--Dreadful sufferings from Heat\r\n     and want of Sleep.--Provisions of the Caravan.--Stratagem to\r\n     preserve Water.--Second Christening in The Desert.--Senawan and\r\n     its group of Oases.--Resume our Journey.--Emjessem.--Met by a\r\n     party of Friends from Ghadames.--Quarrel about Said.--First sight\r\n     of Ghadames.\r\n\r\n\r\n_7th._--WAS awaked by a young man, who said he had brought for \"the\r\nConsul of Ghadames\" (myself) a brace of partridges, some milk, and\r\ngrapes, from the secretary of the Commandant. Drank a large basin of milk\r\nand coffee, and went to pay a visit to the Commandant. Found all the\r\nprincipal Ghadamsee merchants at the Castle, closeted in a small\r\napartment with the Commandant, Ahmed Effendi, talking over the affairs of\r\nthe ghafalah. At first I imagined this officer had brought them up from\r\nYefran to make them pay black-mail in various presents. But it was only\r\nhis vanity which dragged up the poor camels this fatiguing route, an\r\nascent of four hours. Our direct route to Ghadames would have been half a\r\nday farther west. He said he had merely sent for the merchants to ask\r\nthem how they were, and give them his blessing. When I entered, a stool\r\nwas brought me to sit upon. The Rais[12] was seated on a raised bench\r\ncovered with an ottoman, and the merchants were squatted on their hams\r\nupon the matting and carpets of the floor. Coffee was brought me, as to\r\nmost visitors. The Rais asked me where I was going? and what I was doing?\r\nas if he knew nothing about me. I then had my palaver, and represented to\r\nthe Rais the case of taking by force water from the merchants, which took\r\nhim quite aback, and astonished all present, the merchants secretly\r\nadmiring the boldness of the remonstrance. But it was one of those\r\nunpleasant duties which are absolutely necessary to be performed. In our\r\ncase it was necessary for our own health and the order and security of\r\nthe caravan. The Rais surprised and displeased, nevertheless gave strict\r\norders that it should not happen again. The merchants afterwards\r\nexpressed their thanks to me; seeing plainly also the advantage of having\r\none amongst them who was not immediately subject to the Pasha and his\r\nsoldiers. Besides, I hinted to the Rais it would be better if the\r\nghafalah marched more in order, and had a chief. This the Rais discussed\r\nwith the merchants, and it was considered advisable to adopt these common\r\nsense measures, they, however, laughing heartily at my European ideas of\r\norder. I then begged the Rais to persuade the people to travel by night,\r\nas this was the hottest season in the year, and being a new traveller in\r\nThe Desert, I could scarcely support the heat. He replied it would be\r\nbetter for all as we were not now likely to be molested with hostile\r\nArabs. Before separating, a marabout made a short prayer (the _fatah_)\r\nfor the safety of the caravan. This prayer, the first chapter of the\r\nKoran, is never omitted on these occasions. Ahmed Effendi is a very smart\r\nTurk, in the vigour of age and health, and has the character of being\r\nvery stringent in his administration. People call him \"_kus_,\" or hard\r\nand determined in disposition; but he is not ferocious, like the\r\nCommander-in-Chief. His countenance betrayed a very active intelligence.\r\nHe said to me aside: \"Now these people you are travelling with are\r\nbarbarians; you must humour their whims and respect their religion. If\r\nthey were not now present, we would have a bottle of wine together.\"\r\n\r\nThe garrison of Yefran contains some two or three hundred Turkish\r\nsoldiers, as also that of Gharian, besides Arab troops. The Arabs of\r\nthese districts are entirely subdued, their native courage apparently\r\ndried up and extinct. This has been done chiefly by forced emigration or\r\nextermination. The French acquired their _razzia_ system from the Turks\r\nwhom they found in possession of the government of Algiers, on the\r\nconquest of that country; but they have improved on it, for a superior\r\nintelligence imitating a bad system, will always increase its cruelty and\r\nwickedness. We passed many villages depopulated, their humble dwellings\r\nrazed to the ground--the work of the ferocious Ahmed Bashaw, who came in\r\nperson to these mountains. A great deal of fighting had taken place near\r\nthe Castle, and there were the ruins of a very large village on one of\r\nthe neighbouring peaks. Yefran is a very strong position, and was hotly\r\ncontested by both parties. In all these mountain districts very few\r\ninhabitants are seen, and the present cultivation is therefore\r\ninsignificant. The people are without money or stock, and have scarcely\r\nanything to eat. The single advantage of Turkish rule here is, a large\r\nmilitary road cut from the plain to the summit, on which the fort stands,\r\nbut, of course, as a military road, it was not made specifically for the\r\nimprovement of the people. Certainly the Turks must show more civilized\r\nand polite manners to the mountaineers, but the Arabs will not imitate\r\nthem, or, if anything they do imitate, as in the case of all subjected\r\nnations in relation to their conquerors, it is the vices of their\r\nmasters. It is unfortunately much the same when the Turks imitate us\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nBought some meat cheap at Yefran, but my camel-driver afterwards stole\r\nthe greater part. The secretary of the Rais, Bou Asher, who knew the\r\nVice-consul of Fezzan, showed me some kindness, and sent me again milk,\r\nwhich he said was the right of \"The Consul.\" I had also received a nice\r\ndelicious little present of a melon from the Sheikh Makouran _en route_.\r\nThese were the first proofs of a friendly disposition of the natives\r\ntowards me, and were most thankfully appreciated. The people called me\r\n_Taleb_ (\"learned man\"), or _Tabeeb_ (\"doctor\"), or Consul, or the\r\nChristian, just as their caprice or information led them[13]. Here all\r\nthe merchants determined to stop a week, some going to one part of The\r\nMountains, and some to the other, to purchase oil, barley and _gurbahs_\r\n(\"water-skins\"). Many travellers, who had availed themselves of our\r\nescort to The Mountains, here left us.\r\n\r\nI left in the afternoon for the native country of my camel-driver, and\r\nencamped for the night in The Mountains. Our party consisted only of the\r\ncamel-driver, Said, and myself, with three camels. I must say I felt\r\nrather queer knocking about in The Mountains, almost alone.\r\n\r\n_8th._--Rose early, and pursued our way. The air of this elevated region\r\ninvigorated my mind and body; and so by a mishap I took no coffee before\r\nstarting. Passed the kailah under a group of olive trees, called \"The\r\nSisters[14],\" where also flocks of sheep and shepherds were dosing and\r\nreposing under the shade. We exchanged biscuits for milk. The shepherds\r\nwere giving their dogs to drink, and made me wait until they had drunk\r\ntheir fill, thinking no doubt that their dogs were as good as \"a\r\nChristian dog,\" (the ordinary epithet of abuse applied by Mussulmans to\r\nChristians). I had my revenge, for when I had drank my milk, I took good\r\ncare to give them only a fair and exact return of biscuits, which made\r\nthem ask for more, but which I refused. Started again, and did not arrive\r\nat Mohammed's village, in the district of Rujban, till after midnight. It\r\nwas a most wearisome ride. I kept asking Mohammed, \"how far the village\r\nwas off?\" He would say, \"Now three hours;\" in two hours after, it was\r\nstill \"three hours;\" in two hours after that, it was still \"two hours and\r\na half;\" it was \"near\" when it was six hours before we arrived; it was\r\n\"close by us,\" three hours before we arrived, &c. &c. But an Arab will\r\noften tell you a place is just under your nose when it is at a day's\r\njourney distant, pointing to it as if he saw it within a musket-shot. I\r\nwas highly exasperated at Mohammed, because we had delayed to eat\r\nanything all day long, upon his representing to me that we should arrive\r\nan hour after sunset. But the milk acted like a purgative, and was\r\nperhaps advantageous. No people were seen in The Mountains, and very\r\nlittle cultivation. There were a few modern antiquities, chiefly the\r\nstones of Moorish forts and castles. Many villages in ruins, destroyed in\r\nthe late wars. And Mohammed, like a thoughtless idiot, ridiculed the rude\r\ndesolations of his brethren, exulting and calling out to me to see \"the\r\ncooking places.\" Many parts had the geological features of the Sahel, or\r\nhilly country in the neighbourhood of the city of Algiers. The air was\r\npure and cool. But though it was calm this day and the evening, a sudden\r\ntempest got up after midnight. I was lying on the bare ground rolled in a\r\nblanket, when the wind tore it from off me, and I was obliged to retreat\r\nto a hovel. I am told these tempests are frequent in The Mountains, no\r\ndoubt arising from the intense heat rarefying the air.\r\n\r\n_9th._--Slept the greater part of this day to recover from the fatigue of\r\nthe preceding days. Do not suffer much, and am surprised I do not suffer\r\nmore. Asked Mohammed for the quarter of sheep purchased at Yefran, and\r\ntaxed him with stealing it: told him I would give him no backsheesh on\r\narriving at Ghadames. He had stolen the meat to make a feast for his\r\nfriends on his arrival, and afterwards brought me a piece of my own meat\r\ncooked as his own, but which I refused. This is a fine illustration of\r\nbeing generous at another person's expense. In the evening went to see\r\nRujban. There are seven villages forming the district of Rujban. These\r\nconsist of so many mud and stone buildings, but some of the houses are\r\nexcavations out of the solid rock, the principal object being protection\r\nfrom the fiery summer heat, and the intense winter cold. Many of the\r\nhouses have a yard before them, which is walled round, and three or four\r\nare mostly clustered together. Sometimes excavations are made in a pit or\r\nhollow found on high ground, and then a subterraneous passage leading to\r\nthem is excavated from the mountain sides: these are reckoned very\r\nsecure. From the heights where I write, there is a boundless view of the\r\nplain and undulating ground which lie between the Mediterranean and this\r\nAtlas chain. The Arabs call it their sea, and it certainly looks like a\r\nsea from these heights. A marabout sanctuary and garden at the base of\r\nthe mountains, is called their port. There is frequently a freshness\r\nrising from the subjected plain like that of the sea. The camels, they\r\nsay, are their ships. There are besides some pretty views in and over the\r\nAtlas valleys, where you overlook the small scattered oasisian spots of\r\ncultivation, with here and there a palm and little groups of inclosed\r\nfig-trees. Then again, there are heights crowned with olive-woods, as if\r\nThe Mountains had put on a black scull-cap. Some of the precipices are\r\nso profound, as to deserve the epithet of \"horrid.\" In different parts of\r\nthese heights are flights of natural steps, by which they are ascended,\r\nand which seem to have received some finish from Arabian ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the freshness and coolness of mountain air, it has been very\r\nhot these last two days. On the plains, the people say the heat is now\r\noverpowering.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any natural produce about. A few sheep and goats, a\r\ncamel or two, and a few asses, are all the animals I have seen. The\r\nfig-trees produce something, but I have seen no prickly-pears, which\r\nsupport many poor families on The Coast, during several months every\r\nyear. The olive plantations are the principal resource of these poor\r\nmountaineers, which are also a sensible relief for the eye on these bare\r\nheights. In the houses there is hardly anything to be got. No pepper, no\r\nonions, no meat killed or sold. No bread can be obtained for love or\r\nmoney. I laid in a stock of fresh bread in Tripoli for a fortnight, but\r\nmy gluttonous camel driver devoured all in three or four days! There were\r\nno less than fifty twopenny loaves. He was accustomed to eat in the\r\nnight, when I was asleep, and used to threaten to beat Said if he\r\nblabbed. I mentioned the circumstance after, to the Rais of Ghadames, who\r\nobserved: \"If you had brought a thousand loaves, all would have been\r\ndevoured.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this abject poverty, a bullying tax-gatherer, with half a\r\ndozen louting soldiers, have been up here prowling about, and wresting\r\nwith violence the means of supporting life from these miserable beings.\r\nThe scenes which I witness are heart-rending, beyond all I have heard of\r\nIrish misery and rent-distraining bullies. One man had his camel seized,\r\nthe only support of his family; another his bullock; another a few\r\nbushels of barley: the houses were entered, searched, and ransacked;\r\npeople were dragged by the throat through the villages, and beaten with\r\nsticks; and all because the poor wretches had no money to meet the\r\ndemands of these voracious bailiffs. Poverty is, indeed, here a crime.\r\nOne poor old woman had a few bad unripe figs seized, and came to me, and\r\na group of wretched villagers, crying out bitterly. One or two men, who\r\nwere imagined to have something, though they had nothing, were held by\r\nthe throat until they were nearly suffocated. I cursed over and over\r\nagain in my heart the Turks. I was not prepared for such scenes of\r\ncruelty in these remote mountains. We shall find, that amongst the\r\nso-called barbarians of The Desert there was nothing equal in atrocity to\r\nthis. What wonder that the Arab prefers, if he can, to pasture his flocks\r\non savage and remote wastes to being subjected to these regular\r\nGovernments--of extortion! And yet we, in our ignorance of what is here\r\ngoing on, are surprised at their preference. If the people are not ready\r\nwith their money, the little barley, their winter's store, is seized, and\r\nthey must pay afterwards their usual quotas of money. Several bags of\r\nbarley are illegally gotten in this way. The amount of tax or tribute for\r\nthe whole district of Rujban is five or six hundred mahboubs, which is\r\npaid in three instalments, three times a year; but, which though nothing\r\nin amount, is more than all the people are worth together, for riches and\r\npoverty are relative possessions, if the latter can be possessed. If they\r\ncan't pay in money they pay in kind. The Sheikh of the district, with\r\nthe elders, determine how much each man and family shall pay. This, of\r\ncourse, gives rise to ten thousand disputes, heart-burnings, and eternal\r\nwranglings amongst themselves. The Arabs, on these occasions, however\r\nsilent and sulky they may be on others, show that they have the gift of\r\nspeech, as well as Frenchmen and Italians. Then, indeed, God's thunder\r\ncan't be heard. Marabouts do not pay these taxes. This is a privilege of\r\nreligion, which successfully exerts itself against the oppressive arm of\r\nthe civil power. Such privilege has been enjoyed in all ages and\r\ncountries. My camel-driver is a Marabout, and is consequently exempt. I\r\nrallied him upon his privilege, and he replied: \"The villains are afraid\r\nto come here; see my flag-staff and green flag, they dare not come over\r\nmy threshold--God would strike them down!\" It is impossible to tell how\r\nmuch of the five hundred mahboubs gets into the treasury of Government,\r\nbut, I am told, a good portion gets into the pockets of the officials.\r\nThe whole administration of The Mountains, and the Saharan oases of\r\nTripoli, is conducted on the same principles of finance and extortion.\r\n\r\nI am lodged in the house of my camel-driver. The women show the greatest\r\ncuriosity to see me, and declare that I am more beautiful (_bahea_) than\r\nthey. They wonderingly admire everything I have. The greater part of\r\nthese women never left their mountain-homes--never saw a Christian or\r\nEuropean before--and this is the reason of their surprise at my\r\nappearance. The children, of course, are equally astonished, but are too\r\nfrightened to reflect steadily on an European. Both the women and men say\r\nit is _maktoub_, (\"predestination\") which has brought me amongst them,\r\nand they are right. These poor people are very civil to me. In my quality\r\nof tabeeb they consult me. The prevailing disease is sore eyes. Two\r\nchildren were brought to me, a girl with a dropsy of a year's standing,\r\nand a boy with only one testiculum, for neither of which did I prescribe.\r\nThe employment of the men is camel-driving between Tripoli and Ghadames.\r\nAgriculture, there is scarcely any. The women weave barracans or holees\r\nfor their husbands, themselves, and children, and for sale. They are\r\nmostly dirty, and ill-clothed. The men have but a single barracan to\r\ncover them, one or two may have a shirt; the children are nearly naked;\r\nand the women wear a woollen frock, charms round their necks, armlets,\r\nand anclets, sometimes throwing a slight barracan or sefsar round their\r\nheads and shoulders. I observed, however, that often women wear great\r\nleather boots, made of red leather or camel's skin. None of them were\r\npretty, but some were fine-looking, with aquiline noses, and rolling\r\nabout their large, black, gazelle-like eyes.\r\n\r\n_10th._--Spent the day in writing notes. Expect to remain three more\r\ndays. I am, however, comfortably sheltered from the heat, which has been\r\nto-day excessive. Mohammed, my camel-driver, is useful to me as a writer\r\nof Arabic, giving me the names of places in Arabic. But he knows nothing\r\nof Arabic grammar, and writes very poorly, like most of these Marabouts,\r\nalthough he passes for being a very learned man. He purchased some old\r\ndirty leaves of an Arabic book, and exhibited them to the people as\r\nsacred works. The Sheikhs of Rujban and all the great people of the\r\nvillages came to stare at them. They were shocked at my presumption in\r\nwishing to handle these sacred leaves, which were a portion of a\r\ncommentary on the Koran. My Marabout is the Katab, or writer of the\r\nvillage, there being only another who can write here besides himself, and\r\nwho writes very badly. Mohammed, though a saint and a writer, is an\r\nenormous hog, and dishonest, when he can be so with safety. He has begun\r\nbadly, but may turn out better. Said is not of much use yet; he is very\r\nstupid, but not malicious. I must make the best of both, and of every\r\nbody and everything in my present circumstances, conciliating always\r\nwherever I can, and passing by all offences. If I can't do this, I may go\r\nback. I cannot finish these trifling memoranda to-day, without expressing\r\nmy thankfulness to a good Providence, that I enjoy good health and\r\nspirits up to this time, and there is every appearance of my arriving\r\nsafely in Ghadames. \"All is from God!\" (_Men ând Allah El-koul_, as the\r\npeople say.)\r\n\r\n_11th._--Yesterday evening conversed with the Arab villagers, and asked\r\nthem if the soldiers of the Government were gone, _i. e._, the collectors\r\nof the tribute. They replied, \"Yes, thank God, and may they never return!\r\nThe curse of God upon them!\" They then asked me, if the people were\r\ntreated so by our Government. I observed to them, \"Not always. But that\r\nsometimes the British Government sorely oppressed the people, as all the\r\nGovernments of Europe; and I was often tempted to think that there were\r\nonly two classes of people in the world, the oppressing and the\r\noppressed, (_i. e._, the eaters and the eaten).\" To which latter remark\r\nthey all answered with a loud \"Amen,\" and swore it was the truth. They\r\nthen asked me, \"If the English were coming to Tripoli?\" I told them,\r\n\"No,\" for the English had now more countries than they knew what to do\r\nwith. Surprised at this remark, they continued, \"What are the French\r\nvessels doing at Tripoli?\" (There were then a French steamer and a brig\r\nat this time.) I told them to keep away the Turks from attacking Tunis.\r\nThey were anxious to know if the French would come to Tripoli. I\r\nanswered, I thought not, as they had enough of Algeria. \"We hope (_en\r\nshallah_,)\" said they, \"the English are our friends.\" I replied they\r\nwere, but, being friends of the Sultan of Constantinople, they would not\r\ntake possession of Tripoli. The fact was, these poor people were just\r\nsmarting under the oppressive acts of the Turkish tax-gatherers, and they\r\nwould then have sold their country to the first comer for an old song,\r\nwere the buyer Christian, Jew, or Pagan. But I have always found the\r\nArabs fond of talking of politics; it seems instinctive in their\r\ncharacter; and it is astonishing how much policy is always going on\r\namongst their tribes, and how intricate are the various negotiations of\r\nthe Sheikhs. I asked them \"If they had any arms?\" To which they replied,\r\n\"No, none whatever; the Turks have taken them all away.\" And so these\r\nonce formidable mountaineers have not only lost all spirit and courage,\r\nbut have not even arms to defend themselves against the most petty\r\nannoyances. Robberies of the small kind are frequent about the\r\nneighbourhood, and the people are often obliged to gather their figs\r\nbefore they are ripe, lest they should be stolen. At other times they\r\ndisplay great impatience of the seasons, and gather the fruit before\r\nripe. Those who steal provisions are poor famished devils, having\r\nnothing to eat. There is no poor-law here. It is simply a question of\r\ntheft or starvation to death. This is the alternative of Arab life in\r\nmany parts of these mountains.\r\n\r\nThis morning received a visit from the Sheikh of Rujban, Bel Kasem by\r\nname[15], and his head-servant, or factotum. I made them the best coffee\r\nI could, putting into it plenty of sugar. The Arabs are curious people;\r\nthey like things either very bitter or very sweet. Their eyes sparkled\r\nwith satisfaction; they had never tasted coffee before like it, and were\r\nrejoiced--\"Tripoli always belongs to the English!\" Speaking of the\r\nMarabouts, and alluding to my Mohammed, the Sheikh said, \"These fellows\r\npray God and rob men.\" \"Mohammed,\" he added, \"is a rogue, he pays\r\nnothing, and I am obliged to eat up all the people to make up the amount\r\nfor the Bashaw.\" It is curious to observe everywhere this eternal contest\r\nbetween the civil and spiritual power. To pacify him, I told him\r\nChristian priests were many of them as bad as Marabouts (and which is\r\nquite within the mark). The Sheikh and his men had very white teeth. I\r\nobserve nearly all the Arab men and women, as well as the negroes, to\r\nhave extremely white teeth. This has never been medically accounted for;\r\nI believe it arises from the simplicity of the food they eat. Some\r\nTunisian Arabs have reported that large bodies of troops are being\r\nconcentrated at the Isle of Jerbah, in expectation of the Turks. The\r\ntrading Arabs are the gazettes of North Africa.\r\n\r\nSaid's feet are very sore, arising from Mohammed refusing to allow him to\r\nride. I was obliged to tell him, at last, that, unless he permitted him\r\nto ride, Said should not help him to load the camels. This had some\r\neffect, and he allowed Said to ride an hour or two before reaching here.\r\nThis Marabout is, indeed, a cruel, selfish fellow. He also pretends to be\r\nvery jealous, and will not allow any person, much less a Christian, to\r\nsee his wife. He won't allow me to present her a cup of coffee. But I\r\nfound out the reason; the rascal wished to carry it himself, and drink\r\nhalf of it on the way. Afterwards his wife told me herself the reason. An\r\nindiscreet conjugal disclosure this: but such is the character of the\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAn old blind man is calling on me. He tells me his country is my country,\r\nand his people my brothers and sisters. He prays God to bless me and\r\npreserve me. How soft and gentle--how full of good-will and patience--are\r\nthe manners of the blind in all countries! Full fed flesh and the\r\nprosperous are proud and cruel, those stricken with infirmity and misery\r\nshow the milk of human kindness. This poor old gentleman prays all the\r\nday long. Prayer is his daily bread. The Arabs ask me if Said is my\r\nslave. I tell them the English have no slaves, and that it is against\r\ntheir religion, but that some other Christian nations have slaves. They\r\nare greatly astonished that slavery is not permitted amongst us. The\r\nwomen of the village continue to visit me as an object of curiosity. They\r\nnever saw a Christian before. They are always declaring me \"bahea,\"\r\nhandsome, of which compliment I am, indeed, very sensible.\r\n\r\nThis evening, however, the women of our two or three huts, and their\r\nneighbours, played me an indecent trick, with, of course, a mercenary\r\nobject. Although the Barbary dance is rare amongst the Arab women, they\r\ncan have recourse to it at times to suit their objects. The men were gone\r\nto bring the camels, and the women sent Said after them on some frivolous\r\nmessage. Four of the women now came into my apartment, and taking hold of\r\nhands, formed a circle round me. They then began dancing, or rather\r\nmaking certain indecent motions of the body, known to travellers in North\r\nAfrica. At once nearly smothered and overpowered, I could scarcely get\r\nout of the circle, and pushed them back with great difficulty. At this\r\nthey were astonished, and wondered all men, Christians and Mussulmans,\r\ndid not like such delicate condescension on their part. \"Don't you like\r\nit, infidel?\" they cried, and retreated from my room. I now saw their\r\nobject. They began begging for money vehemently, saying, \"Pay, pay, every\r\nbody pays for this.\" Nothing they got from me; and the wife of the\r\nMarabout came afterwards, imploring me to say nothing to her husband. It\r\nis thus these rude women will act for money, as many who are better\r\ntaught, in the streets of London. But acts of indelicacy are nevertheless\r\nvery rare amongst the mountain tribes. I have seen Arab women at other\r\noccasions, on a cold day, standing athwart a smoking fire, with all the\r\nsmoke ascending under their clothes. This may be expected, and is\r\ncharacteristic of the filthy habits of these wretched mountaineers. But\r\ncases of adultery are unknown amongst these simple people.\r\n\r\n_12th._--A beautiful Arab girl, a perfect mountain gazelle, came with her\r\nmother to consult me about her eyes, being near-sighted. Recommended her\r\nto apply to Dr. Dickson, if she ever went to Tripoli; and wrote her a\r\nnote to him. Many other people came for medicines. Went to see an old man\r\nwhose eyes were bad with ophthalmia. I gave him some solution to wash his\r\neyes, and he gave me in turn a jar of new milk. Something was said about\r\nolive-oil, and I asked where we could get some. They said there was none\r\nin Rujban. The lady of my host thinking me incredulous, pulled her gray\r\ngrisly hair, and exhibited its crispness and dryness, observing, \"See,\r\nwhere's the oil?\" Of course such an argument was conclusive that they had\r\nno oil in the house.\r\n\r\nThe villagers, in this season, do absolutely nothing, unless it be sleep\r\nall day long. The fact is, it is awfully hot, from early morn to evening\r\nlate, and they have little to do. All that they have to do, many of them\r\ndo with apparent dispatch. At the dawn of day the wind is so strong, one\r\ncannot enjoy an hour of the morning's freshness; and, in the evening, the\r\nsultry ghiblee is equally disagreeable. I scarcely go out of my room the\r\nwhole day. Begin to recover my Arabic. Many times I have begun and\r\nre-begun this difficult language. But there is no remedy. I must work,\r\nand work brings some pleasure, at least destroys ennui and kills time.\r\nHowever little time we have, we wish it less.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs ask me, \"Why the Christian priests have no wives?\" The\r\nMohammedans and Catholics go to extremes in their ideas of separating or\r\nconnecting women with religion and sanctity. The Mohammedans think a\r\nsaint or marabout cannot have too many women or wives, which, they say,\r\nassist their devotion--a sentiment which they pretend to have received\r\nfrom Mahomet himself by tradition. The fact is, the prophet was very fond\r\nof women. The Catholics would seem to think a priest better with\r\nabsolutely no wife. This is a mere struggle between sensuality and\r\nasceticism. There is no love or affection in it. I showed Mohammed an\r\nempty bottle. He took a piece of paper and wrote: \"The bottle is empty of\r\nwine, God fill it again.\" Such is Arab marabout literature.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Elhamdullah! The wind has changed, the furnace breath of the\r\nghiblee is gone out! We have now a pleasant breeze from N.W., the bahree,\r\nas the Arabs call it. We can now go out any time; before we were\r\nprisoners the live-long day. Mohammed, who pretends to all sciences,\r\nsays: \"There are three modes of cure--\"1st, Blood-letting; \"2nd, Fire and\r\nburning; \"3rd, The word of God.\"\r\n\r\nHe made this observation in applying verses of the Koran to the eyes of\r\nhis wife's sister, which he said were more efficacious than all my\r\nphysic. Some of these bits of paper, with the name of God written on\r\nthem, were steeped in water and swallowed by the patient. This\r\nsuperstition of swallowing bits of paper, with the name of God and verses\r\nof the Koran written on them, as well as the water in which the paper is\r\nsteeped, is prevalent as an infallible remedy in all Mahometan Africa.\r\nMarabouts are all powerful in The Mountains; and a woman, pointing to her\r\nchild, said to me:--\"That boy is the child of a Marabout. I never allow\r\nanother man to sleep with me.\" Nevertheless, the women still display\r\nintense curiosity in seeing \"The Christian,\" and will declare, \"By G--d,\r\nyou are beautiful, more handsome than our men.\" They admire the most\r\ntrifling thing I have, and add, \"God alone brought you amongst us.\" Their\r\nlanguage, though indelicate to us, is not so to them. It is the\r\nundisguised speech of a rude people.\r\n\r\nWent this morning to see El-Beer, or \"the well,\" the real fountain of\r\nlife in these countries. Was much pleased with the visit; and found it at\r\nthe bottom of a deep ravine, bubbling out from beneath the shade of palms\r\nand olives, amidst wild scenery of rugged steeps and hanging rocks. There\r\nare indeed, four springs, but all apparently from the same source. They\r\nare not deep, and have near them troughs for watering sheep, goats,\r\ncattle, and camels. These wells furnish water for two mountain districts.\r\nThe water is of the purest quality, clear as crystal, aye, clear as--\r\n\r\n          \"Siloa's brook that flow'd\r\n    Fast by the oracle of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe road to them is very difficult, over rattling, rumbling stones, and\r\nrocks, and precipices, and it is hard work for the poor women who fetch\r\nthe water, for the wells are distant nearly three miles from our village.\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh came to my Mohammed, asking him to write to Tripoli, to\r\ncollect the money due to the Bashaw from certain people of this country,\r\nwho are now working in that city. They look sharp after these poor\r\nwretches. Amuse myself with washing my handkerchiefs and towels, and\r\nmending my clothes. I also always cook and do as much for myself as I\r\npossibly can. Besides doing things as I like, it amuses me. Bought\r\nanother skin-bag for water, and shall now distribute the three amongst\r\nus, and each shall drink his own water during the four days of our route,\r\nwhere no water is to be found. This will prevent wrangling on the way,\r\nand make each person more careful of this grand element of life in The\r\nDesert. Mohammed put a little oil in the skin before filling it, to\r\nprevent it from cracking. This gives the water an oily taste for weeks\r\nafterwards, but we get used to it, and are glad of water with any taste.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency the Sheikh got very facetious to-day. He offered to sell\r\nme his authority, his Sheikhdom, and retire from affairs. I bid one\r\nthousand dollars for the concern. \"No, no,\" said he, \"I'll take ten\r\nthousand dollars, nothing less.\" Then, getting very familiar, he added,\r\n\"Now, you and I are equal, you're Consul and I'm Sheikh--you're the son\r\nof your Sultan, and I'm a commander under the Sultan of Stamboul.\" The\r\nreport of my being a Consul of a remote oasis of The Sahara was just as\r\ngood to me on the present occasion as if I had Her Majesty's commission\r\nfor the Consular Affairs of all North Africa. Who will say, then, there\r\nis nothing in a name? A tourist in Africa should always take advantage of\r\nthese little rumours, provided they are innocent. But the traveller more\r\nfrequently has to encounter rumours to his disadvantage. Many visitors,\r\nmen, women, and children--some brought milk, others figs and soap. Soap\r\nis considered a luxury in all the interior cities, and people will beg\r\nsoap though never use it, but keep it as a sort of treasure. Fig and\r\nolive trees abound in the mountains, but for want of rain have produced\r\nnothing this year. So of most other vegetables products. Goats only are\r\nin abundance, of animals. The ordinary food of the people is bazeen, a\r\nsort of boiled flour pudding, with a little high-seasoned herbal sauce,\r\nand sometimes a little oil or mutton fat poured on. It is generally made\r\nof barley-meal, but sometimes flour. This is the supper and principal\r\nmeal of the day. As a breakfast, a little milk is drank, or a few dates\r\nwith a bit of bread is eaten. The rule of these mountaineers is, indeed,\r\nnot to eat meat, though some of them have flocks of sheep.\r\n\r\n_14th._--His Excellency the Sheikh roused me from my bed this morning. He\r\nsaid he could not sleep, and therefore I ought not to sleep. According to\r\nhis Excellency, Rujban contains 500 souls, all in misery and starvation.\r\n\"The country is _batel_ (good for nothing),\" he says. It is certain the\r\ngreater part of the people have not enough to eat, or half the quantity\r\nof what is considered ordinarily sufficient. In the neighbouring\r\ndistricts, S.W., there are 1,500 souls. Ahmed Bashaw destroyed the\r\ngreater part of the inhabitants of these mountains, and disarmed the\r\nrest, leaving not a single matchlock amongst them. Such are the Turkish\r\nideas of mountain rule--absolute submission or extermination!\r\n\r\nThis morning is cool and temperate. Every day continue to administer\r\nsolution for ophthalmia, and even those whose eyes are quite well, will\r\nhave a drop of it put on their eyes. They say it will prevent them, after\r\nI am gone, from having the malady. Everybody begs a bit of sugar, a\r\nlittle bread, a scrap of paper, a something from the Christian. Content\r\nall as well as I can.\r\n\r\nThis evening saw, for the first time \"the playing with the head,\" which\r\nis performed by females. This was done by a young girl. After baring her\r\nhead and unbinding her hair, throwing her long dark tresses in\r\ndishevelled confusion, she knelt down and began moving her chest and head\r\nin various attitudes, her whole soul being apparently in the motion. Part\r\nof her hair she held fast in her teeth, as if modestly to cover her face,\r\nthe rest flew wildly about with the agitation of her head and chest, and\r\nall to the tune or time of two pieces of stick, one beating on the other,\r\nby the woman upon whose knees she leaned with her hands. The motion was\r\nreally graceful, though wild and dervish-like, but there was nothing\r\nlascivious in it, like the dancing of the Moors, nor could it well be,\r\nthe upper part of the body only was in agitation, being literally \"the\r\nplaying with the head.\" I never saw this before or again in North Africa.\r\nI gave the young lady twenty paras, the first time she had so large a sum\r\nin her life. Received a present of leghma from the Sheikh, very acrid and\r\nintoxicating. The women admire much my straw hat, made of fine Leghorn\r\nplat, and wonder how it is done. None of the inhabitants but our Marabout\r\nread and write. Portions of the Koran, however, are committed to memory;\r\nand one day an old blind man repeated several chapters of the Koran for\r\nmy especial edification. He did it as a protest of zeal against my\r\ninfidelity before the people, but I took care not to show that I was\r\naware of the object. The men pray now and then, the women never, that I\r\ncould see, and never think of religion beyond ascribing all things, good\r\nand bad, to God. Indeed, all classes in these mountains think the sum of\r\nreligion consists simply in ascribing all matters, how great or how\r\nsmall, how evil how good soever, to the Divine Being. When they have done\r\nthis, they think they have performed an act of piety and mercy. At my\r\nrequest, Mohammed made Said a pair of camel-driver's shoes, or sandals,\r\nto save his best. The plan is primitive enough. They get a piece of dried\r\ncamel's hide, and cut it into the shape of the sole of the foot. Then\r\nthey cut two thongs from the same hide. Holes are now bored through the\r\nsoles, a knot is made at the end of the thongs, and they are pulled\r\nthrough the holes. The whole is then rubbed over with oil; the hairy side\r\nof the hide is fitted next to the foot, and the thongs are bound round\r\nthe ancles. These sandals serve admirably well their purpose; some are\r\nmade of double soles. But for the especial benefit of our cordwainers, I\r\nmay mention, the African shoe has no heel to the sole.\r\n\r\n_15th._--His Excellency the Sheikh, and his factotum, or shadow, took\r\ncoffee again with me this morning. A cup of coffee is a rare treat in\r\nRujban. The Shadow of his Excellency brought me a few bad Fezzan dates,\r\nfrom which oases The Mountains are mostly supplied. Dates are not\r\ncultivated in The Mountains. The palm requires a low and flat sandy soil.\r\nThe climate is not of so much consequence as the soil. Jerbah, and the\r\nKarkenahs, islands in the Mediterranean, produce as fine dates as the\r\nmost favoured oasis of The Sahara. The Sheikh tells me there are thirty\r\nnegro slaves in his district. One would wonder how the people could keep\r\nslaves when they can scarcely keep themselves. His Excellency is very\r\nsulky. He threatens to resign his Sheikhdom. The poor Sheikh is the\r\ndirtiest, unhappiest mortal of all his people. He is without wife, family\r\nor friend; he is without a rag to cover himself, except a filthy\r\nblanket. He houses in a little dirty cabin. In looks he is a hard\r\nstrong-featured man, and large of limb. I asked his Excellency what he\r\ngot by his Sheikhdom, to plague him. He growled, \"_Shayen_ (nothing).\"\r\n\"Why don't you resign?\" I continued. \"I can't; all my ancestors, from the\r\ntime of Sidi Ibraim, and our lord Mahomet, were Sheikhs. We're one blood.\r\nI shall dishonour them:\" he returned. The principle of aristocracy is\r\nirradicably bound up in the Arabian social economy. The levelling and\r\nco-operative system has no place here. The Sheikh's factotum is a noisy,\r\nroguish-looking Arab, with several bullet-marks about him received in the\r\nlate wars. As he does all his master's dirty work, he is universally\r\ndetested. Master and man swear the country is ruined. There certainly is\r\nnothing in these villages to render life tolerable. No rustic plays; no\r\nmoon-lit dance to the sound of the rude calabash drum and squeaking pipe;\r\nno cheerful family circle--all is poverty and loneliness! Such a life is\r\nreally not worth living. To make wretchedness still more wretched, for\r\nthree years there has been no rain in these mountains. God's power and\r\nman's cruelty press sorely upon these miserable people.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity of the villagers begins to abate, or my Mohammed refuses\r\nthem admission into his house to see me. He pretends to be honest in his\r\nopinion of his countrymen. He says: \"The Arabs are all dogs (_kelab_).\"\r\nThey certainly have most begging propensities. And Mohammed adds, that\r\nwhen they have sufficient they will still beg, being born beggars. But,\r\nalas! these poor people, I am sure, never know now what it is to have\r\nenough. Yesterday some audacious thief stole the Sheikh's leghma. His\r\nfactotum is foaming with rage, but the Sheikh laughed heartily at the\r\nimpudence of the thief. His Excellency is accustomed to send me some\r\nevery morning. I shall here relate a case or trait of selfishness amongst\r\nArab women. I gave to the wife of the Marabout half a bottle of solution\r\nfor washing her eyes should she be attacked with ophthalmia. Her\r\nsister-in-law, living next door, was laid up in a dark room with a\r\ndreadful ophthalmia. She sent her husband to beg a little of the\r\nsolution. The Marabout's wife first denied that she had any, and then\r\nthat she could find it. When I came from my walk, I scolded her soundly\r\nand gave the poor sufferer some solution.\r\n\r\nThe Marabout seeing my little stock of oil, burst forth with a violent\r\npanegyric on olive oil, as he dipped his fingers into it and licked them,\r\nnot much to my satisfaction:--\"Oil is my life! Without oil I droop, and\r\nam out of life; with oil, I raise my head and am a man, and my family\r\n(wife) feels I am a man. Oil is my rum--oil is better than meat.\" So\r\ncontinued Mohammed, tossing up his head and smacking his lips. I have no\r\ndoubt there is great strength in olive oil. An Arab will live three\r\nmonths on barley-meal paste dipped in olive oil. Arabs will drink oil as\r\nwe drink wine.\r\n\r\n_16th._--This morning we leave for Ghadames. What is remarkable, nearly\r\nall the Mountaineers offered me their services, and were willing to leave\r\ntheir native homes, and go with me any where or everywhere. I hardly\r\nobserved a spark of fanaticism in them, so far as accompanying me was\r\nconcerned. They were all actuated with the common and universal feeling,\r\nto obtain something to live withal in this poor world.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to give some minutiæ of Arab mountain life. It will be\r\nseen to be not very stirring or agreeable, and there is certainly no\r\nromance in it, but, such as it is, I offer it to the reader, and he must\r\nmake the best of the information. Life is life under any and all forms.\r\n\r\nFrom Tripoli to The Mountains our route was southwest, so that we were\r\nnot so far from the coast as at first might be imagined, from the number\r\nof days' journey, and we were still within the influence of some cool sea\r\nbreezes, for any point almost between west and northeast, brought\r\nreviving life to The Mountains, in this terrible season of heat.\r\n\r\nMy journey seemed now to begin again, I felt a sickening regret, even in\r\nleaving my new Arab acquaintances. But the oppression which ground down\r\nto the dust these poor people filled my mind with the horror of despotic\r\ngovernment. I was glad to get away from its victims, and from under the\r\nsphere of its influence, and plunge into the wild wastes of The Sahara,\r\nwhere I could breathe more freely. I must relate one other anecdote\r\nillustrating this oppression. A poor man sold me a peck of barley. The\r\nmyrmidons of power, hearing of the sale, immediately went to him, and he\r\nrefusing to give them the money, they got hold of his throat and nearly\r\nstrangled him. To make them desist, I paid them also the value of the\r\nbarley. Several of the poor people ran out after me when I mounted the\r\ncamel, and amongst them many women and children, all crying out\r\n\"_Bes-slamah, bes-slamah_,\" (Good-bye, good-bye). We now entered upon the\r\nmost difficult, and the most critical part of our route in this season,\r\nand I commended myself and the people again to Eternal Providence.\r\n\r\n_20th._--Seenawan. I find it impossible to write daily in this part of\r\nthe route.\r\n\r\nI have seen lately in the newspapers and geographical journals, that a\r\nFrenchman is going to traverse Africa from west to east, and that he is\r\nto make hourly observations with scientific instruments. I think the\r\nparties who write such paragraphs must be either madmen, or grossly and\r\nunpardonably ignorant of the nature of African travelling. If a traveller\r\nis in his sober senses, half the time he is _en route_, he is a happy\r\nman. But to proceed.\r\n\r\nOur first object was to find the rendezvous of the ghafalah. I said to\r\nMohammed: \"Are you sure the ghafalah is on the march to-day?\" \"The\r\nghafalah is like the sun,\" he replied, \"every body knows it will move\r\nto-day.\" About four hours after looking over the undulating ground, I\r\nthought I saw at about six miles distant some black spots moving, and\r\nturning to Mohammed, I said, \"What's that?\" He exclaimed, \"The camels!\r\nthe camels! I told you I was right, and don't you see I have struck into\r\nthe right path?\" I was glad to hear this, for I was not yet sufficiently\r\nbroken in to desert travelling to be wandering about as we were in search\r\nof moving parties of the ghafalah. An hour after I took off the shade\r\nfrom my eyes, for I had still a slight ophthalmia, and looking round, I\r\nfound we were in the midst of detached parties of the ghafalah, widely\r\napart, but all hurrying in one direction. We were not near enough (indeed\r\nsome miles off) to have any conversation with them. By noon we had all\r\nrendezvoused upon a pleasant plateau of The Mountains. The merchants\r\nwelcomed my return, and asked me what I had been doing. I said, \"We have\r\ndelayed too long.\" They smiled:--\"Oh, you don't understand; you see we\r\nhave one day for buying oil, another day for barley, another for skins,\r\nanother for doing nothing,\" &c. It appeared to me a bungling way of doing\r\nbusiness. But some of them had been obliged to go a day's journey to\r\npurchase a few things. The ghafalah had, in fact, been scattered all over\r\nThe Mountains. A few never left Yefran. This was my first taste of delay\r\nin Saharan travel.\r\n\r\nWe began our four days' journey in the evening, and continued all night\r\nup to two hours before sunrise. The camels then rested but were not\r\nunpacked. All the people now got a few winks of sleep. At dawn we started\r\nagain, and halted for the day after two hours and a half of marching. In\r\nthe afternoon, about half-past four, we then resumed our march, and in\r\nthis manner we continued for the four days. Our pace was upon an average\r\nthree miles per hour, sometimes two and a half, and sometimes three and a\r\nhalf. On looking at the camel you think it goes slow, but when you look\r\nat the driver, you observe that he is often kept up to a very good\r\nwalking pace. Our camels were five days without drinking, for they drank\r\nthe morning before we left.\r\n\r\nI was once going to write, \"the Arabs pack their camels as badly as\r\npossible; make their journeys as long as possible; travel as much in the\r\nsun as possible[16];\" but these last four days have convinced me that,\r\nunder the guidance of a good Arab chief, they know what they are about,\r\nand can do things with order and dispatch.\r\n\r\nI don't know how it was, but it came into my head that, on leaving The\r\nMountains, and proceeding south, we should soon descend again, as if we\r\nwere to cross some mighty ridge or series of ridges of the Atlas. Every\r\nmoment I expected to descend into valleys or plains, corresponding to the\r\ncountry which lies between Tripoli and The Mountains. Getting impatient,\r\nafter nearly a day's march, I asked for the plains. The people turned\r\nupon me with surprise, and said:--\"_Lel Ghadames, koul hathe souwa,\r\nsouwa_, All like this to Gadmes.\" I found, indeed, that, after getting\r\nfairly into The Mountains, and proceeding south, you first entered upon a\r\ndeep undulating country, with here and there a profound ravine, then a\r\npretty verdant inclosed plateau, and then a bare towering height, all\r\nwhich _accidented_ country dissolved at last into an immeasurable plain.\r\nProceeding south, however, we found a new species of mountains began to\r\nraise their long, lone, dull, dreary naked forms; and, asking Mohammed\r\nwhat they were, he replied correctly enough:--\"These are _Gibel Sahara_,\r\n(Saharan Mountains).\" The plateaus and undulating ground were in places\r\ncovered with loose stones, with sand and sand-hills scattered or heaped\r\nabout. Then these stones and sand were partly covered at this season with\r\nsun-dried and sun-burnt herbage, mostly very coarse, with here and there\r\na few bushes and shrubs. Many also were the dried beds of rivers, and\r\nthere were still wider and profounder depressions of land than these\r\nwaterless wadys. But all is now burnt, scorched, dried up, and the\r\nnakedness of the Saharan ridges is responded to with a hideous barrenness\r\nfrom the intervening plains and valleys. Not a single living creature was\r\nvisible or moving; not a wild or tame animal, not a bird nor an insect,\r\nif we except a tiny lizard, which seems to live as a salamander in heat\r\nand flames, now and then crossing our path at the camel's foot, and a few\r\nflies, which follow the ghafalah, but have no home or habitation in The\r\nDried-up Waste. Nor was there a sound, nor a voice, or a cry, or the\r\nfaintest murmur in The Desert, save the heavy dull tramp of our caravan:\r\nall else was the silence of death! However, my Marabout tells me, in the\r\nwinter the whole scene is changed. \"There is then,\" he says, \"herbage,\r\nrain, birds, gazelles, and all things.\" It is certain that within nine\r\nhours' ride from Rujban we passed the stubble of two or three patches of\r\nbarley, which had been rescued from the dominion of The Desert.\r\n\r\nAs to myself, personally, in this part of the route, I have suffered most\r\nfrom want of sleep. In the day-time it was too hot to sleep, and in the\r\nnight I was on the back of the camel, where, of course, for the present,\r\nI could not be expected to sleep, though many of the Arabs, nay,\r\nmerchants slept. I should say all slept on the camel as soundly as in a\r\nbed. So that what I saved of suffering from the heat of day-travelling, I\r\nlost in want of sleep by night-travelling. Poor human brute! I thought of\r\nthe fable of the ass and his winter and summer advantages and\r\ndisadvantages. The hottest day was yesterday, last of the four, when we\r\nencamped in a dry bed of a river. I shall never forget that day, forget\r\nwhat I may else! I was first on the point of being suffocated, and seemed\r\nat my last gasp. I began to think that the predictions of my _friends_ in\r\nTripoli were about to be verified. I was to succumb to make them\r\nprophets! In addition to this my deep distress, I felt the wound of\r\npride. I got some tea made, I can't tell how, and poured some brandy\r\ninto it. This I drank, and from a fever of delirium found myself\r\nconscious again, and swimming in a bath of perspiration. The crisis was\r\nnow passed, and I was to see Ghadames and Ghat, and return to my\r\nfatherland. So fate--rather Providence--would have it. Every day, until I\r\nreached Ghadames, there was a sort of point of halting between life and\r\nsuffocation or death in my poor frame, when the European nature struggled\r\nboldly and successfully with the African sun, and all his accumulated\r\nforce darting down fires and flames upon my devoted head. After this\r\npoint or crisis was past, I always found myself much better. It is\r\nstrange that my head never ached, nor was in any way affected during the\r\nwhole route, except in the one day mentioned. Some and all have vainly\r\ninvoked sleep upon a bed, in the time of darkness and cold, but those who\r\ncall for the god in the African Desert, in midday of the hottest season\r\nof the year--and to the last moment of starting with a long, long night\r\nof travel before them--as they lay rolling on the burning sand, and he\r\ndisdains to shed his dull influence over the eyelid, know, indeed,\r\nsomething of this kind of human suffering, and how dreadfully long and\r\ndreary were those nights! What signified the sight of the ten thousand\r\norbs moving in silent mystic dance, and dressed out in soft bright fires,\r\nover the poor traveller's head! Alas! it was a mockery of his woes. . . .\r\nFour days and four nights were thus passed, without four hours of sleep.\r\nI often wonder if I could go through this again. I had an additional\r\nsuffering of the eyes. I never took the veil from my face from sunrise to\r\nsunset, for had I done so, I should have had the hot sand immediately\r\ninto them. We had ghiblee or simoon every day. But, thanks to Heaven, now\r\nends the greatest of my sufferings from heat.\r\n\r\nWe were escorted by sixty Arab troops on foot, like those who\r\nescorted us from Tripoli to The Mountains. The Pasha mostly chooses\r\nthem from districts through which we pass, and in this way secures a\r\nguard well acquainted with the route. But how odd, before the Turks,\r\nin the good old days of The Bashaws, these very Arabs were the\r\nbanditti of the route. A Ghadames merchant said to me one day,\r\n\"Yâkob[17], see these fellows; formerly all were villanous\r\n_Sbandout_ (banditti).\" The captain of this escort, Sheikh Omer, who\r\nwill conduct us to Ghadames, was charged by the Commandant of The\r\nMountains, that his men should not be allowed to take water, or\r\nanything else by force, \"bel kouwee,\" as the merchants said. The\r\nSheikh was a civil fellow, and found it his interest to cultivate my\r\nacquaintance. Every morning I invited him to take coffee and tea in\r\nmy tent, and he never forgot to come. In acknowledgment, he sent me\r\nsome liquid butter, which was not excessively bad. The food of the\r\nArabs, and the poorer sort of the merchants, for this journey was,\r\nas written by my Mohammed, ‮‮سُوِيقَ زُمِيته‬‬\r\n(\"Souweekah-Zameetah,\" that is, two names); but commonly called\r\nZameetah, which is nothing more than barley or wheat burnt or\r\nmalted, then ground, and afterwards made into paste. On this is\r\nsometimes poured a little oil or fat; but many cannot afford this\r\nluxury, and must content themselves with a little water to make up\r\nthe meal into paste. I may safely affirm, there was not a bit of\r\nmeat eaten, or a drop of tea or coffee drunk, in the whole caravan\r\nof merchants, with 200 camels, including, with the Arabs, some 150\r\npersons, during the last four days, except what was eaten and drunk\r\nin my tent. I myself had only a little bit of fowl. The Sheikh\r\n_Shabanee_ (Makouran) as the Arabs call him, was the most civil to\r\nme. His portion of the camels is about forty, and he seems a most\r\nrespectable old gentleman. He has two sons with him. He gave me last\r\nnight a guzzle of cool water, a large brass pan full, of the size of\r\na warming-pan, which I drank off in an instant, and found it more\r\nlike nectar, than our earthy animalculæ water; it was so deliciously\r\ncool and sweet. Valuable, indeed, becomes a thing of commonest use,\r\nfrom its scarcity. The old Sheikh has a donkey with him to carry his\r\ndrinking-water. The skins keep the water cool even in the hottest\r\npart of the day, whilst some which I had in bottles became quite\r\nhot. I shall here relate an ingenious stratagem, which I recommend\r\nto all African travellers. On leaving The Mountains we had three\r\nskins of water, one for each. But first, one of the skins cracked,\r\nand we lost a good deal of water, before it could be mended. Then\r\nMohammed, the chief thief, was accustomed to drink large draughts\r\nwhen neither myself nor Said was present. This we learnt from the\r\nrest of the caravan. Said, himself, poor fellow, as soon as Mohammed\r\nhad turned his back, was either to beg me to give him extra water,\r\nor help himself. Sometimes I chided him, at others I gave him water,\r\nor was too much exhausted to see what he was about. Then Said would\r\nhelp his friends amongst the Arabs now and then, and sometimes the\r\nArabs helped themselves, by going behind me, and sucking from the\r\nneck of the skin whilst I was riding. To avoid this, Mr. Gagliuffi\r\ntold me he always put the neck of the skin-bag before and not\r\nbehind, so that it was impossible for a person to drink, and at the\r\nsame time to walk backwards with the camel going forwards, or at any\r\nrate to do so without being seen. Then, finally, there was the\r\nterrible action of the sun on the water, often reducing it by a\r\nfifth, and sometimes a third, of our supply. But the consequence of\r\nall this was, our three bags were empty before we arrived at\r\nSeenawan, and the little water which had remained, the third day,\r\nwas so shaken in the skins, all being oiled, that for me it was not\r\ndrinkable. Now for the stratagem. Apprehending this waste of water,\r\nI got twelve pint bottles filled with water at Tripoli, which were\r\npacked away as wine and spirits, neither Mohammed or Said suspecting\r\nthe contrary. Accordingly I quietly despatched my couple of bottles\r\nof _acqua pura_ per day, as the London lady drinkers are said to\r\ntake their sly drops from the far corner of the cupboard, without\r\nthe least suspicion of my fellow travellers. I overheard once,\r\nMohammed speaking of me to Said: \"By G--d! these Christians, what\r\nlots of rum they drink: that's the reason, Said, the sun does not\r\nkill him--he'll never die. These Christians, Said, are the same as\r\nthe dæmons; they know everything, but God will punish them at\r\nlast--if not, there's no God, or Prophet of God.\" I took no notice,\r\nbut when we got to Ghadames, I took the remaining bottle, and asked\r\nhim to drink. He jumped up with alarm. I then called him a fool, and\r\nproved to him I had been drinking water at the time he thought I\r\nhad been drinking rum. He laughed, and said, \"Ajeeb, ente Yâkob\r\nâkel: (Wonderful, you James are wise.)\" I then took upon myself to\r\nlecture Mohammed, abusing him for his carelessness in not preserving\r\nthe water, and asking him if he thought that I, on the first time of\r\ntraversing The Desert, could put up with dirty water like them, and\r\ngo without for days, or with a very small quantity?\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh Makouran continues very civil: to-day he gave me a supply of\r\nonions for making soup, and promises to give me a house to live in, when\r\nI get to Ghadames. I have, in turn, to give him some medicine, on my\r\narrival, for one of his two wives. I rode a little the Sheikh's donkey\r\nlast night, at his request. It is nothing like the camel, it stumbled a\r\ngreat deal over the loose stones, and I am told the horses stumble as\r\nmuch. I felt the immense superiority of the camel, with its slow regular\r\npace and sure foot, in these stony wastes. The Sheikh's ass is the only\r\nanimal of the beast-of-burden sort in the whole caravan, besides the\r\ncamels. I noticed, however, a few extra unladen camels, which take turn\r\nwith others for carrying, as also several foals following lightly and\r\nfriskily their dams. _En route_, during the nights, the Arab soldiers\r\namused themselves by firing off their matchlocks, the most advanced party\r\nanswering the farthest behind, and _vice versâ_. The noise of the gun\r\nbroke through the painful silence of The Desert, and came finely back\r\nreverberating from the Saharan hills with double and treble discharges of\r\nsound. When their powder began to be exhausted, and they have never more\r\nthan half-a-dozen charges, they sang their plaintive love ditties, or\r\nchatted to the merchants. On the whole, they showed great good temper,\r\nand, pennyless and naked, were happier than well-clothed and wealthy\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon of yesterday a letter was brought to me, written by\r\nGameo, which had been in the ghafalah nearly all the length of the route,\r\nbut had been forgotten. This stated that Mr. Macauley, the American\r\nConsul, had kindly prepared a small package of American rum for my\r\njourney, and had forgotten to send it till too late--in fact, like\r\nseveral persons in Tripoli, he really thought, what from the intrigues of\r\nthe Pasha, and the obstacles of the season, I should never get off. I may\r\nobserve, the nearer a person is to an object, it often happens he sees it\r\nless:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view.\"\r\n\r\nThere is infinitely less enthusiasm for African discovery,--nay, more\r\nhorror of African travelling in Tripoli than in London: in truth, the\r\ngreater part of the Europeans of Tripoli, and in all Barbary towns, are a\r\ndegraded unenthusiastic race, wholly occupied with their petty quarrels\r\nand intrigues. Of course, a man of my stamp was considered by them either\r\n\"_un sciocco_\" or \"_un matto_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the misfortune of Africa to be surrounded by a cordon of vitiated\r\nraces, half-caste and mongrel breeds, propagated from adventurers and\r\nconvicts from the other continents of the world. So that Africa learns\r\nnothing but the vices of civilization from its contact with the rest of\r\nthe world. It is also certain, that the native tribes of Africa itself\r\nare more immoral and barbarous on the coasts than in the interior.\r\n\r\nWe have had the full moon during our last four days. Our route is always\r\nmore or less south-west.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, Said is knocked up and lamed. The Marabout has cheated\r\nSaid all along out of his rides, under pretence of his having made him a\r\npair of shoes. This Marabout is the cunningest, cruellest rogue I ever\r\nmet with. But I must here relate a service which he rendered me of\r\nconsiderable importance. Nobody could pronounce, at any rate _recollect_,\r\nmy name. Mohammed said to me one day, \"_Ingleez_, we have many names,\r\nhave you no more than one? The ghafalah can't learn your name, it's too\r\ndifficult. Make a name like ours, if you haven't one.\" I then told him I\r\nhad another, _James_, and that it was in Arabic, _Yâkob_. Hereupon, his\r\neyes moved round wildly with joy, and he cried out,--\"That's it! that's\r\nit!\" He immediately started off amongst all the people, calling out my\r\nname was \"_Yâkob_.\" This _second_ christening in The Sahara was an\r\nimmense advantage to me. There is now not an oasis in the wildest and\r\nfarthest region of the Great Desert but what has heard of _Yâkob_. When I\r\narrived at Ghat I was astonished to find even the Touaricks calling me\r\n_Yâkob, as if I had been brought up with them_. Clapperton and the rest\r\nof his party adopted Mahometan names, and were wise in doing so. When I\r\nwas in Fezzan, Clapperton's Arabic name of _Abdallah_ was mentioned more\r\nthan twenty years after his death in Soudan. Denham was called The\r\n_Rais_, being an officer.\r\n\r\nThe road from The Mountains to Seenawan is very good. The greater part,\r\nindeed, is beautiful broad carriage-road. It is generally well marked\r\nwith camel-paths, about a foot wide. These well-beaten, well-trodden\r\npaths, are very sinuous, running one into another, and often are in great\r\nnumbers, running parallel in serpentine style, and containing a united\r\nbreadth of a hundred yards. There are a few places where no road-traces\r\nare apparent to the European eye, but the well-practised eye of the\r\nBedouin camel-driver, like the eye of the Indian in the American\r\nWilderness, can see things, and shapes, and signs in The Desert which\r\nentirely escape us. Along the line of route small heaps of stone are\r\nplaced, said by my Marabout \"to point out the way.\" We did not meet a\r\nsingle traveller all the four days, no small parties--no couriers--no\r\none. I shall not soon forget our reaching Seenawan. It was a few hours\r\nafter midnight. I looked forward to it as the haven of rest from all my\r\nsufferings. A fellow-traveller came up to me, (for I had been asking all\r\nnight long to see it,) and said, \"See, Yâkob, there is the _Nukhlah_\r\n(palms) of Seenawan.\" Looking through the shadowy moon-light, I thought I\r\nsaw something very small and black, and made a start at it from my camel\r\nas if I was going to leap into a downy bed of rest under the eternal\r\nshade of grateful palms. When the object is grasped, how its value\r\nvanishes! We threw down the mattress under the shade of a little ruined\r\nround tower, and I fell asleep. But such a tempest got up that the people\r\nwaked me, covered with sand, and made me crawl into a hole, called the\r\ndoor of the _burge_. Here, amongst heaps of stones and dirt, I fell\r\nasleep again, and did not wake till called next day near noon.\r\n\r\nSeenawan is but a handful of date-trees, thrown upon the wide waste of\r\nThe Sahara, with one or two pools of sluggish running water, sheltering\r\nbeneath its palms thirty or forty inhabitants. There are four or five\r\nspots of vegetation, gems of emerald on the rugged brow of The Desert.\r\nThe houses, if such they are, consist of half a dozen or more of mud\r\nhovels huddled together, here and there a little stone stuck in the\r\nwalls, and some dark passages running beneath them. One or two had a\r\ncouple of stories and a stone wall round them. Yet, within, they are\r\ncool, and have dark rooms to protect the inhabitants from both heat and\r\ncold. There are also two or three mud and stone _burges_, or round\r\ntowers, to protect the few dates and spots of green. Nevertheless, in\r\nthis pretence of existence, surrounded by the frightful sterility of The\r\nDesert, glowed the warmth of true hospitality. The Arab merchant, Zaleeâ,\r\nwho lives here, and had been one of our caravan, made me come to dine\r\nwith him in his house, and introduced me to his family. He gave me for\r\ndinner boiled mutton and sopped bread. When I started next day, he\r\npresented me a supply of eggs and two fowls, a sumptuous feast in The\r\nDesert! I found his wife and daughter suffering with ophthalmia, and made\r\nthem up a pint-bottle of solution for washing the eye. I had had to wash\r\nthe eyes of many poor Arabs during the last few days. I gave Zaleeâ's\r\naged father half a dozen ship's biscuits, a part of one of which he\r\nsopped and ate. The old gentleman offered up a prayer for my safety, and\r\nsaid he would save one to eat on my safe return.\r\n\r\nThe morning of the 20th was horribly hot, but I was housed and sheltered\r\nin the old _burge_. I received a present of some fresh dates. This was\r\nthe small black date of Ghadames, which is peculiar to two or three\r\noases about here. They were delicious as fruits of the garden of the\r\nHouris, and certainly now more esteemed by me. The Commandant, seeing me\r\nwrite to-day, wished to have the honour of his name being written in my\r\njournal. It is Omer Ben Aly Ben Kareem Bez-Zeen Laseeâ. The people showed\r\nno jealousy at my writing notes. Indeed, they were quite aware this was\r\npart of my business, and often assisted in telling me the names of\r\npersons and places. Never went an European into the interior with less\r\nsuspicions flying about him amongst his fellow-travellers. I attribute\r\nthis, in a great measure, to the frankness with which I spoke about\r\nGovernment and the Turkish authorities, as well as the Consular people of\r\nTripoli. Besides, I never affected to conceal my objects. Here a man\r\nwrote in my journal the names of abuse applied to the lazy, lagging\r\ncamels, for his own especial amusement; viz., \"_Ya kafer, Ya kelb, Ya\r\nYehoud_, 'Oh thou infidel!' 'Oh thou dog!' 'Oh thou Jew!'\" In a quarrel,\r\nthe Arabs transfer them complacently to one another, with sundry\r\nadditions and oaths, too broad for ears polite. _Kafer_, (\"infidel,\") and\r\n_Deen El-kelb_, (\"religion of a dog,\") are the most odious terms of abuse\r\nwhich they can throw at one another.\r\n\r\n_21st._--We left early this first sprinkle of Seenawan vegetation, and\r\npassed the 22nd at the larger spot of the oases. This second spot is\r\ncalled Shâour; but both oases are included in the first name, as Ghat and\r\nBerkat are included in _Ghat_. It is necessary to make these distinctions\r\nin order to guard against error in laying down the routes. Shâour\r\nconsists of a few stunted date-trees, a little _gusub_, a grain esteemed\r\nalmost as much as wheat, and one or two fig or other fruit-trees. The\r\nunited oasis, though but containing a population of sixty souls, and all\r\nvery poor people, pay 600 mahboubs per annum to the Pasha of Tripoli. The\r\noldest man of the place told me, that, from the first hour of his\r\nobservation and recollection, to the present time, the water had always\r\nbeen the same in quantity. There is always a little more in the winter.\r\nIt is running water, and as it runs and bubbles up to the surface it is\r\ndistributed over the little garden plots and patches. I asked him why he\r\ndid not make the gardens larger? \"God bless you,\" he replied, \"we would\r\nif we had more water.\" It is surprising to notice the regularity of even\r\nthis scanty supply of water through the years of an old man's life,\r\nupwards of eighty, in the heart of The Desert, for such is the site of\r\nthe oasis of Seenawan. I looked about for birds, but saw none. My aged\r\ninformant said, \"In the winter there are some doves.\" No wild beast haunt\r\nthe environs; they cannot get at the water. The people keep a few sheep,\r\ngoats, and fowls. There are also a dozen or so of camels. It is\r\nremarkable that the soil of this speck of vegetable existence is entirely\r\nsandy, and all the water comes out of the sand. But in places, indeed, on\r\nthe coast of Barbary, the finest and most vigorous vegetation often\r\nbursts forth out of a purely sandy soil. By the time all the ghafalah had\r\ntaken their supply of water, and the camels had drunk, the pools were\r\ndried up or exhausted, and the people of the village had to wait for the\r\nrunning of the water. I put a last question to my aged Saharan\r\n_Cicerone_,--\"How do you live here, do you work?\" \"I am always sleeping,\"\r\n(or _kāéd_, \"reposing.\") \"But, how do you get anything to eat?\" \"Oh, I\r\neat every other day, when I can get it, and sleep the rest of the time:\r\nwhat can I do?\" Such is vegetable and animal existence here!\r\nNevertheless, this show and sham of life looks fair, fresh, nay,\r\nenchanting, after the five days' desert; and all, as well as myself,\r\nwelcomed Seenawan as a little Hesperides.\r\n\r\nWe were a tolerably harmonious caravan, but had now and then a good\r\nquarrel. To-day a serious misunderstanding broke out between the\r\nCommandant Omer and one of the merchants. I could not learn what it was\r\nabout, but Omer drew his sword twice to strike the merchant, and was only\r\nprevented doing so by the bystanders rushing on him. The Sheikh Makouran\r\ncame to me apart and said: \"Now, if they ask you who's to blame, say\r\nboth.\" We then advanced to the parties, and the Sheikh turned to me, and\r\nsaid: \"_Yâkob_, who's to blame?\" I immediately said, though I knew\r\nnothing of the business: \"Everybody, all of you.\" This was the signal for\r\na burst of laughter, and the group separated. The quarrel, however, did\r\nnot finish, it was carried to Ghadames and settled there. The Arabs enjoy\r\na good quarrel, and, like good ale, they prefer it, not being too new,\r\nbut caulked up a bit. The greater part of their occupation and amusement\r\nis supplied by quarrels.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Seenawan the merchants dispatched a courier to Ghadames,\r\nand Mohammed wrote a letter to the Governor, telling him very pompously:\r\n\"The English Consul of Ghadames was approaching the city under his\r\nprotection.\" Mohammed said he had submitted the letter to the Sheikh\r\nMakouran, and it was approved. I approved of anything that had not my\r\nname attached to it.\r\n\r\n_22nd, 23rd._--Left in the afternoon, and continued all night, till two\r\nhours before day-break. Rose at sun-rise and continued till nearly noon.\r\nHalted for the Kailah, and afterwards resumed our journey, continuing all\r\nnight. The people of the ghafalah amused themselves in the night, by\r\n\"playing at powder.\" As they fired the matchlocks, they shouted the name\r\nof the person whom they intended to honour, mostly firing off the gun\r\njust under his nose. Mohammed was very active in the business, and kept\r\nfiring off my praises, and those of the Sheikh Makouran. This mode of\r\ncompliment is universal in North Sahara. The Marabout is a good\r\npolitician, and knows what he is about. He knew that Makouran and myself\r\ncould serve him. The style of firing off these praises was this: \"Who's\r\nthis for?\" cries the person that has the musket ready loaded. A number of\r\npersons, the flatterers of the great man, answer, \"The Sheikh Makouran!\"\r\nThe majority has it if other names are mentioned. The man with his gun\r\nthen runs before the Sheikh, and fires it off in his face, or a very\r\nshort distance from him.\r\n\r\nThe camel-drivers showed a perverse disposition for continuing all night\r\nthe 22nd and 23rd, and would not halt, without difficulty, for the two or\r\nthree hours' rest before day-break. The Commandant called for more than an\r\nhour: \"_Ya oulād oŭăl kāéd_, (You first fellows stop!)\" I never felt\r\nso angry with any people, as I did with these oulad in advance, I myself\r\nwas calling out, \"You first fellows stop!\" But they were full a mile in\r\nadvance. The Arabs are very fond of this sort of disorder and annoyance\r\nto others. Another party took it into their heads to halt at noon, the\r\n23rd, several miles from the rest. The Commandant went after them, broke\r\nup their encampment with violence, using his sword to hide them, and\r\nbrought them up to the main body. Very windy these two days, and got the\r\nsand in everything, cooking utensils, cups, glasses, bowls. We found the\r\nsand, however, occasionally useful, and used it instead of water for\r\ncleaning our platters and cooking pots. Some of the people say, it is\r\nbetter than water for cleaning pots and platters.\r\n\r\nI have already said how my camel was harnessed, if harnessing it can be\r\ncalled. First, two panniers were placed (nicely balanced), which formed a\r\nsort of platform upon a level with the camel's back-ridge and hump; a\r\nmattress and skins next were placed on this, which were tied down with\r\nArab herb-cords, and carried under the belly of the camel, securing the\r\npanniers as well as the coverlets. A small ottoman was then put at the\r\ntop, on which I sat as on a chair-cushion, with my legs hanging down on\r\neach side of the camel's neck. Sometimes I lay at my full length across\r\nthe mattress. But this the people disapproved of for fear I should fall\r\noff. They, however, frequently slept this way whilst riding. I was\r\ndressed as slightly as possible, and had on a gingham frock coat, with a\r\nleghorn hat. During the time the sun was above the horizon, I held up an\r\numbrella and tied a dark-green silk handkerchief over my eyes and face. I\r\ncould have borne more clothing, but I think the Moors and Arabs had too\r\nmuch. They don't change the quantity with the season, and wear as much in\r\nsummer as in winter. The consequence is, they are very cold in winter,\r\nand very much oppressed in summer; but it is mostly the want of means\r\nwhich does not allow them to change their clothing with the season. I\r\ncarried a little bottle of spirits and water to drink. In the night I was\r\nto eat a little biscuit. None of the camels had bridles, unless used\r\nsolely to ride upon. The camel which I rode was a very good one, and very\r\nknowing, and, like many knowing animals, very vicious. He was in the\r\nhabit of biting all the other camels which did not please him on their\r\nhind quarters, but took care not to get bitten himself. He seldom\r\nstumbled, and I was rarely in fear of falling. A camel will never plunge\r\ndown a deep descent, but always turn round when it comes to the edge of a\r\nprecipice. I often rode for several hours with comparative comfort. The\r\ncamel-drivers never ride when their camels are laden, sometimes suffering\r\nas much as the camels themselves. I somewhat offended the self-love of\r\nthe people of Ghadames. I asked them whether Ghadames was bigger than\r\nSeenawan. They said pettishly, \"Ghadames _blad medina_, (Ghadames is a\r\ncity).\"\r\n\r\n_24th._--Emjessen. Arrived at these wells about 10 A.M. Earlier we had\r\npassed a place where they were trying to get water. Emjessen is a vast\r\nsalt plain, which is covered over in different parts with a coating of\r\nsalt, hard enough and thick enough to furnish materials for building. And\r\nhere they were building a _burge_, \"tower,\" or _kasbah_, \"castle,\" or\r\n_fonduk_, \"caravanserai,\" (all which names people called it,) with a\r\nlarge wall round the principal wells, the materials of which were red\r\nearth and lumps of salt, some of which appeared as hard as the soft Malta\r\nstone. The water is, of course, brackish, but nevertheless the camels\r\ndrank it with eagerness. I was staring at the eagerness with which the\r\ncamels were drinking, when the Commandant said, \"_Enhār săkoun, Yâkob_,\"\r\n(a hot day, James,) \"do the camels in your country drink water in that\r\nway?\" Hereat a merchant interposed, and instructed the Rais that the\r\nEnglish had no camels, but lived on boats in the water. This is a very\r\ncommonly spread opinion respecting the English in The Desert. But Caillié\r\nsays of the Foulahs near Kankan, and other tribes: \"The prevailing idea\r\nof the people in the interior of Soudan is, that we inhabit little\r\nislands in the middle of the ocean, and that the Europeans wish to get\r\npossession of their country, which is the most beautiful in the world.\"\r\nMohammed would not allow his camels to drink here, and said the water was\r\nbad. Emjessen is situate about ten hours from Ghadames, say, a short\r\nday's journey.\r\n\r\nThe Sahara all around now showed still more marked features of sterility,\r\nof unconquerable barrenness. Here too, for the first time, I saw\r\nboundless ridges and groups of sand stretching far away to the\r\nsouth-west, but they were low squatting heaps. Some sand-hills we had\r\ncrossed for an hour or two. Mohammed called them _wâr_, and asked me to\r\ndescend to save his camel's legs, I thought my legs less practised in The\r\nDesert than the camel's, and kept my place. Here were spread about,\r\nbetween the sand-hills and low black stony ridges, plains of salt and\r\nchalk. My first impression was, that the sea had once covered these\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nOur route was still south-west, and south, and the prevailing wind\r\n_ghiblee_, or from about the same quarter.\r\n\r\nOn leaving _Emjessem_, we were met in the afternoon by several friends\r\nand relatives of the merchants, who had come from Ghadames in answer or\r\ninvitation to our letters written at _Seenawan_. These strangers (to me)\r\nwere finely mounted upon camels of the Maharee species, both themselves\r\nand their camels dressed out superbly, the camels being tightly reined\r\nup like coursers. They had a novel and noble appearance, and I thought I\r\nsaw in them something of the genuine features of The Desert. They had\r\ncome eight or ten miles an hour, a long _galloping_ trot, for such is the\r\nmotion of the camel. As soon as the two parties met, there was a\r\nsimultaneous scamper off of our camels, and some of theirs got very\r\nunmanageable. I was nearly thrown off, and it required Mohammed and Said\r\nto hold my camel until the alarm had subsided. The Sheikh Makouran was\r\nobliged to dismount and ride his donkey. I asked Mohammed what was the\r\nmatter, for I could not understand this strange confusion all at once\r\namongst the camels. He cried very angrily, \"The camels are drunk, are\r\nmad--God made them so.\" When things got more settled, the merchants\r\nexplained to me that it was the antipathies of the two races, the\r\n_coast_-camel, and the Maharee or _desert_-camel. That each was alarmed,\r\nbut the most fierce and dominant was the Maharee, which always assumed\r\nthe mastery over the coast-camel, \"like,\" added one, \"the Touarick\r\nassumes to be lord over the Arab.\"\r\n\r\nTo-night I was obliged to quarrel seriously with Mohammed. Said was now\r\nquite lame and could not walk more. I told Mohammed plainly he should\r\nhave no present as first promised, since he had broken his agreement\r\nabout Said's riding. He then put Said on a camel. The merchants were much\r\namused at the quarrel, and thought me an ass to quarrel about _a slave_,\r\n(for such they esteemed Said) having a ride[18]. Some few observed I was\r\nright, and bullied Mohammed, who now made another lying excuse, that his\r\ntwo camels were knocked up, which was the reason Said didn't ride. The\r\nearly part of the night he had been riding one of them himself, and\r\ntaxing him with this, he said, \"Yes, but was I not ill, didn't you give\r\nme some water and acid, and sugar?\" I replied, \"Yes, I recollect it too\r\nwell, I'm sorry I had so good an opinion of you.\" The Commandant now came\r\nup, and some bawled, \"Here's a _shamatah_[19] with Said,\" and explained\r\nthe business. The Commandant, without any more to do, takes the back of\r\nhis sword and belabours Mohammed till he cries for mercy. Then the people\r\nbeg the Rais to desist, and say, \"Mohammed is a _marabout_ and must not\r\nbe beaten.\" Mohammed was very cunning, and always took care to repeat\r\naloud a prayer when we started afresh from any station, and so gained the\r\nesteem of the more pious. Said rode the rest of the way to Ghadames.\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the night of the 24th we reposed. At dawn of\r\nday, on the 25th, we started fresh on the last march. Just when day had\r\nbroken over half the heavens, _I saw Ghadames_! which appeared like _a\r\nthick streak of black_ on the pale circle of the horizon. This was its\r\ndate-woods. I now fancied I had discovered a new world, or had seen\r\nTimbuctoo, or followed the whole course of the Niger, or had done\r\nsomething very extraordinary. But the illusion soon vanished, as vanish\r\nall the vain hopes and foolish aspirations of man. I found afterwards\r\nthat I had only made one step, or laid one stone, in raising for myself a\r\nmonument of fame in the annals of African discovery!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] The term Rais is applied by these people both to a naval and\r\n    military commander, the literal meaning being \"head.\"\r\n\r\n[13] When an European arrives first in a remote Barbary town,\r\n    although there may be many Europeans in the place, he is mostly\r\n    called and mentioned in Moorish society as \"The Christian,\" which\r\n    happened to myself in Mogador.\r\n\r\n[14] How strangely the genius of nations of such different habits\r\n    have given the name of \"sisters\" to separate groups of trees. I\r\n    have also passed twin peaks of mountains in Africa, called\r\n    \"brothers\" by the Arabs. But _Bou_ or _Abou_, \"father,\" is the\r\n    ordinary appellation of things in North Africa. _Omm_, \"mother,\"\r\n    is also very common. The two last are found in combination.\r\n\r\n[15] Long names are not confined to European rank and royalty. The\r\n    Sheikh's name in full is, \"The Sheikh Bel Kasem Ben Ali\r\n    Abd-el-Hafeeth, the Rujbanee.\" And this is only the quarter of the\r\n    length of some of these names.\r\n\r\n[16] So I found it written in the first portions of the journal.\r\n\r\n[17] _Yâkob_, Arabic for James.\r\n\r\n[18] There were certainly several slaves walking; but they were\r\n    all long accustomed to it, whilst Said had only just come out of a\r\n    weaver's establishment, where he had been many years.\r\n\r\n[19] Turkish, \"a row;\" but mostly \"war,\" \"battles.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nRESIDENCE IN GHADAMES TO BEGINNING OF THE RAMADAN.\r\n\r\n     Arrival at Ghadames.--Welcome of the People.--Interview with the\r\n     Governor, Rais Mustapha.--Distances of the route from Tripoli to\r\n     Ghadames.--Geographical position of the Oasis.--First sight of\r\n     the Touaricks.--Commence practising as Quack-Doctor.--Devotion of\r\n     the Arabs.--Prejudices of the People, and overcome by the\r\n     Rais.--Many Patients.--My House full of Touaricks.--The Sheikh of\r\n     the Slaves.--Character of my Camel-Driver.--I make the tour of\r\n     the Oasis.--Visit to the Souk.--Prejudices against me\r\n     diminish.--First sight of Birds.--A young Taleb's specimen of\r\n     Writing.--My Turjeman's House.--The Negro Dervish.--Touarick\r\n     Camel Races.--A few Drops of Rain.--Various Visits,\r\n     Conversations, &c., about Timbuctoo.--Prevalent Diseases, and my\r\n     Medicine Chest.--Evening previous to the Ramadan.--Houses, Public\r\n     Buildings, and Streets.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADUALLY we neared the city as the day got up. It was dusty and hot, and\r\ndisagreeable. My feelings were down at zero; and I certainly did not\r\nproceed to enter the city in style of conqueror, one who had vanquished\r\nthe galling hardships of The Desert, in the most unfavourable season of\r\nthe year. We were now met with a great number of the people of the city,\r\ncome to welcome the safe arrival of their friends, for travelling in The\r\nDesert is always considered insecure even by its very inhabitants.\r\nAmongst the rest was the merchant Essnousee, whose acquaintance I had\r\nmade in Tripoli, who welcomed me much to my satisfaction when thus\r\nentering into a strange place. Another person came up to me, who, to my\r\nsurprise, spoke a few words in Italian, which I could not expect to hear\r\nin The Desert. He followed me into the town, and the Governor afterwards\r\nordered him to be my turjeman, (\"interpreter\"). Now, the curiosity of the\r\npeople became much excited, all ran to see _The Christian_! Every body in\r\nthe city knew I was coming two months before my arrival. As soon as I\r\narrived in Tripoli, the first caravan took the wonderful intelligence of\r\nthe appointment of an English Consul at Ghadames. A couple of score of\r\nboys followed hard at the heels of my camel, and some running before, to\r\nlook at my face; the men gaped with wide open mouths; and the women\r\nstarted up eagerly to the tops of the houses of the Arab suburb, clapping\r\ntheir hands and _loolooing_. It is perhaps characteristic of the more\r\ngentle and unsophisticated nature of womankind, that women of The Desert\r\ngive you a more lively reception than men. The men are gloomy and silent,\r\nor merely curious without any demonstrations. I entered the city by the\r\nsouthern gate. The entrance was by no means imposing. There was a\r\nrough-hewn, worn, dilapidated gate-way, lined with stone-benches, on\r\nwhich The Ancients were once accustomed to sit and dispense justice as in\r\nold Israelitish times. Having passed this ancient gate, which wore the\r\nage of a thousand years, we wound round and round in the suburbs within\r\nthe walls, through narrow and intricate lanes, with mud walls on each\r\nside, which inclosed the gardens. The palms shot their branches over from\r\nabove, and relieved this otherwise repulsive sight to the stranger. But I\r\nwas too much fatigued and exhausted to notice any thing, and almost ready\r\nto drop from off my camel. In fact, the distance which I had come since I\r\nfirst saw the dark palms of the city at the dawn, seemed to exceed\r\n(mostly the case when exhausted in completing the last mile of the\r\njourney,) all the rest of the route. I now proceeded forthwith to the\r\nGovernor, the Rais Mustapha, being led by the people _en masse_, who, on\r\nseeing me, said, \"_Es-slamah! Es-slamah! Es-slamah!_\" ordered me coffee,\r\nand gave me a cordial welcome. It was about 10 A.M. His Excellency was\r\nsitting out in the street on a stone-bench, under the shade. Some\r\nvisitors were sitting at a distance, and servants were lounging about.\r\nThe Governor's house is without the city, in the gardens. It was cleanly\r\nwhite-washed, but small, only two stories high. Before the door it was\r\nwell watered, and there was a freshness springing up from the water just\r\nsprinkled about. Several palms cast gracefully their dark shadows on the\r\nstreet. The Governor was very sick, his face was tied up, and his eyes\r\ncovered. But he smoked incessantly. He said only a few words through his\r\ninterpreter. I was equally out of order, and begged him to allow me to go\r\nto the house which was being prepared for me. He consented; and two hours\r\nafter his Excellency sent me a dinner of mutton, fowls, and rice.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked my opinion as to this journey, and its being undertaken\r\nby an European, I would answer for myself, that I would risk it again,\r\nbecause I know my constitution, and how to treat myself. But I could not\r\nconscientiously recommend it to others in this season of the year. Were I\r\nto perform it again, I would manage much better. I would be better\r\nmounted, have a better tent, and a better assortment of provisions. Most\r\nassuredly I have great reason to thank Providence that I am arrived in\r\nperfect health.\r\n\r\nThe whole time from Tripoli to Ghadames had occupied twenty-three days,\r\nbut seven or eight had been consumed by delay in The Mountains. The\r\nabsolute distances of travelling given me by Mohammed, are:--\r\n\r\nFrom  Tripoli to Janzour           3 hours.\r\n \"    Janzour to Zouweeah          9   \"\r\n \"    Zouweeah to Beer-el-Hamra    2   \"\r\n \"    Beer-el-Hamra to Shouwabeeah 5   \"\r\n \"    Shouwabeeah to Wady Lethel  14   \"\r\n \"    Wady Lethel to Aâyat         3   \"\r\n \"    Aâyat to Yefran              3   \"\r\n \"    Yefran to Rujban            18   \"\r\n \"    Rujban to Seenawan           4 days.\r\n                        (sometimes 5.) \"\r\n \"    Seenawan to Emjessen         2   \"\r\n \"    Emjessen to Ghadames         1   \"\r\n\r\nThe quickest time, in more general terms, in which the journey can be\r\nperformed, excluding of course all stoppages, is:--\r\n\r\nFrom  Tripoli to The Mountains     3 days.\r\n \"    The Mountains to Seenawan    3  \"\r\n \"    Seenawan to Ghadames         3  \"\r\n\r\nThe French geographers, for some reason, have made Ghadames situate upon\r\na salt plain, confounding its site with the salt plain of _Emjessen_.\r\nThere is no salt plain in the suburbs of Ghadames, or the country near.\r\nAccording to the _official_ letter of the Porte, written by Ali Effendi,\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, the oasis is situate in the _Caimakat de\r\nJibel Garbigi_. As I did not receive the Porte's memorandum of my recall\r\nfrom Ghadames until my return, I made no inquiries of this mountain\r\n_Garbigi_, but I imagine it exists, though I never heard its name.\r\nGhadames is situate in 30° 9′ north latitude, and in 9° 18′ east\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\n_25th._--I find my house, which had been prepared for me by the kindness\r\nof the Sheikh Haj Mohammed Makouran, very commodious and tolerably clean,\r\nand I make myself at home. It is situate in the suburbs, close by the\r\nGovernor's house. I now tried to get a nap, but could not. Then I went to\r\nbathe in the Mysterious Spring, whence springs up this city as an emerald\r\namidst a waste of stone and sand! Intend bathing every day if I can. Saw\r\nEssnousee again, and many of the merchants whom I had seen at Tripoli.\r\nFound them all civil. But the people who most excited my attention were\r\nthe Touaricks, whom I now saw for the first time. Many of them were here\r\nat this time for trading purposes. They expressed as much astonishment at\r\nseeing me as I them, some exclaiming, \"God! God! how could the Infidel\r\ncome here?\" Late in the afternoon, after napping, went again into the\r\ncity: was much pleased with its appearance. Thought it better than\r\nTripoli, considering the position of the respective places, Tripoli on\r\nthe edge of the sea, and open to all the world, and Ghadames in the midst\r\nof The Desert, far from the shores of the Mediterranean. No poor are seen\r\nbegging about the streets, and all the people look well dressed today.\r\nThey had put on their holiday clothes, which is usual on the arrival of a\r\nlarge caravan. What a contrast was this to the squalor and filth of\r\nTripoli, with its miserable beggars choking up all the thoroughfares! No\r\nwomen were seen about but the half-castes, mostly slaves, but plenty of\r\nchildren playing here and there. I heard amongst them the whisper of\r\n\"The Kafer, the Kafer!\" as I passed by.\r\n\r\nBegan to practise my quackery very early, and administered solution for\r\nthe eye in various parts of the streets _pro bono publico_. The Rais sent\r\nfor me likewise, and I poured a few drops of caustic into his eyes. In\r\nfact, I was full of business, although but a few hours in the town, and\r\nhardly had time to look about me. This business after such a journey! My\r\nturjeman, Bel-Kasem, also took me into his garden, and gave me a supply\r\nof onions, peppers, and dates. The gardens appeared quite equal to those\r\nof Tripoli. The turjeman was soon useful, though he only spoke a few\r\nwords of Italian, but chiefly because he had less prejudices against the\r\nChristians than his fellow-townsmen. He had worked in the house of a\r\nFrench merchant in Tunis many years, and always retained a sort of\r\nsneaking kindness for Frenchmen, which indeed was much to his credit. In\r\nwalking about the town, I was followed by groups of children and black\r\nwomen, all running one over another to see me. My turjeman was obliged to\r\nbeat them to keep them off. I am the _second_ Christian who has visited\r\nGhadames; the first being the unfortunate Major Laing, who never returned\r\nto record what he saw in this city! But his residence of a few days here\r\nis forgotten by nearly all the present generation. The Rais is the only\r\nTurk. All the troops are Arabs. The Ghadamsee people are never soldiers.\r\nThis evening the Rais sent me supper, much the same as the dinner.\r\n\r\nThe people of the ghafalah (the Arab strangers), went to pray this\r\nevening in the mosque set apart for strangers. I must not omit the\r\nmention of the strict and scrupulous exactitude with which all the\r\nghafalah prayed _en route_. Five times a day is prescribed by the Koran.\r\nMost of them prayed the five times, but not altogether, some choosing\r\ntheir own time, a liberty allowed to travellers. It was a refreshing,\r\nthough at the same time a saddening sight, to see the poor Arab\r\ncamel-drivers pray so devoutly, laying their naked foreheads upon the\r\nsharp stones and sand of The Desert--people who had literally so few of\r\nthe bounties of Providence, many of them scarcely any thing to eat--and\r\nyet these travel-worn, famished men supplicated the Eternal God with\r\ngreat and earnest devotion! What a lesson for the fat, overfed Christian!\r\nAnd shall we say, that because these men are Mohammedans, _therefore_ the\r\nportals of heaven are hermetically sealed against the rising incense of\r\ntheir Desert prayers? . . . It is hard to think so . . . though some\r\nthink so.\r\n\r\n_26th._--Employed as yesterday in administering the medicines. My\r\nturjeman did not come to-day, and I suspected, intuitively almost, the\r\npeople of Ghadames had persuaded him not to come. It turned out\r\nafterwards that my suspicions were well-founded; nevertheless, I received\r\nseveral small presents from the people. The merchants are civil, but some\r\nlittle jealousy discovers itself on religious grounds. All Mohammedans\r\nhave got an idea that the Christians will one day take their countries\r\nfrom them, but that, in the end, with the aid of God, they will revenge\r\nthemselves, and repossess all their cities and countries: \"This,\" said my\r\nMarabout, \"is a prophecy contained in our sacred books.\" My presence is\r\ntherefore by some considered the preliminary for the overthrow of the\r\nMussulman power of Ghadames, I am the scout, the spy into \"the nakedness\r\nof the land;\" others think I pollute the sacred city of Ghadames with my\r\ninfidel carcass. Yesterday I got also entangled in the labyrinth of dark\r\nstreets, some of which are often turned into mosques at certain hours of\r\nthe day. Of this the people complained to the Rais, who sent me word to\r\nbe careful. I replied, I was an utter stranger, and did not know what I\r\nwas about; in fact, the Rais excused me to the people saying, \"A little\r\nby little, The Christian will know to do all which is right. We must\r\nteach him.\" Indeed, I found the conduct of Mustapha from the first very\r\nkind, and he was determined no improper prejudices should get into the\r\nheads of the people against me. The Rais continued to send me breakfast,\r\ndinner, and supper. \"This,\" said the servant, \"would continue _three_\r\ndays, according to custom;\" in fact, I found the same custom adopted by\r\nthe Governor of Ghat. Caillié mentions the custom as prevailing amongst\r\nthe Braknas. But it will soon be seen that the Rais did not stint his\r\nhospitality to this conventional usage. His Excellency found his eyes\r\nbetter to-day, and I gave him a dose of pills.\r\n\r\nMy camel-driver came up to me in his usual soft sneaking way, and began\r\nhis pious jargon:--\"God be praised for Yâkob, because he has arrived safe\r\nin Ghadames--now God is one, and above all things powerful. Besslamah.\"\r\nThis he was wont to repeat _en route_. He then said gravely, \"Now, Yâkob,\r\nyou are my friend--you wish to go to Soudan, I will go with you, if you\r\nlike, but I will sell you my camel, on which you rode here. You know it's\r\ngood and very wise. It doesn't stumble. Buy it, I'll sell it because you\r\nare my friend, you shall have it cheap, for twenty-five dollars.\" The\r\nfact is, the camel had got a small hole in its back, and being afraid he\r\nshould not cure the camel, he wanted me to buy it. Twenty-five dollars is\r\nthe average price of a camel.\r\n\r\n_27th._--Paid a visit this morning to the Rais; told him the turjeman was\r\nafraid to come with me to show me the city and interpret, because the\r\npeople said to him, \"Bel-Kasem, thou must not show The Christian the\r\nsacred things of our holy city: never were they polluted by an infidel.\"\r\nThe Rais smiled and ridiculed the thing, and said he would send for the\r\nman. I observed I would pay him so much per day. \"No,\" he replied, \"I am\r\nhis master, you are a stranger, I must pay.\" Whilst we were talking, a\r\nletter came informing the Rais that some robbers had carried off six\r\ncamels from the village of Seenawan. The Rais was displeased and said to\r\nme, \"All this country is _batel_ (good-for-nothing).\" I asked the Rais if\r\nthere were a prison in Ghadames.\r\n\r\n_H. E._ \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n_I._ \"Is there any body in it?\"\r\n\r\n_H. E._ \"No.\"\r\n\r\n_I._ \"How?\"\r\n\r\n_H. E._ \"This is a city of dervishes and marabouts--people don't\r\nsteal--if they've nothing to eat they beg.\"\r\n\r\nPeople are calling at my house all day long for medicines. Every morning\r\nI send tea (made, of course,) to the Rais and the Sheikh Makouran.\r\nPresented the Rais with my Moorish portfolio, all worked over with\r\nvarious devices in leather and silk. He was quite delighted with it,\r\nobserving, \"The Christians are good people, but the people here don't\r\nknow them. Yâkob, take courage, little by little,\" (a favourite\r\nexpression of the Rais). Next to my house is a garden whose date-trees\r\nbear no fruit, and its beds are covered with dry dust, a sad picture of\r\nneglect. On asking how this was, I was told the owner was in Soudan, and\r\nin consequence no one looked after and watered his garden. The merchants\r\nof this city often remain in Soudan five, ten, even fifteen and twenty\r\nyears, leaving their families here whilst they accumulate a fortune in\r\ncommercial speculations. Sometimes they marry other wives in Soudan, and\r\nform another establishment.\r\n\r\nBathed again in the Spring, but found it surrounded with women, fetching\r\nwater. Contented myself with washing in one of the private washing\r\napartments attached to the Spring. The water was warm, but I felt\r\nafterwards cool and refreshed. There are no public baths here as on the\r\ncoast towns. I observed the place formed of a high raised stone-bench,\r\njust as you enter the city, (on our side) where all strangers pray. It\r\nseems built on, the principle of some Romanist churches, which are\r\ndedicated, like those of the ancient classic temples, to particular uses\r\nand services. My Marabout prayed in it with devout fervour as we passed,\r\nI being obliged to wait for him.\r\n\r\nThis evening dined with the Rais at his house for the first time. His\r\nExcellency was extremely kind and spoke freely of the Ghadamsee people.\r\n\"These,\" said he, \"are a people given up to prayer, and many of them\r\nspend their time in nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nI said, \"Are there ten thousand people in Ghadames? So I have heard.\"\r\n\r\nAstonished, he replied, \"There are not five hundred men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there not several of the people travelling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a few.\"\r\n\r\nThen, talking of thieves and banditti, the Rais told me to bring my money\r\nto his house in order that he might take care of it. On depositing it\r\nwith him he asked how much it was. There were only two hundred piastres\r\nof Tunis, all the money I had. The Rais seemed surprised it was so little\r\n(about _seven pounds sterling_!) I made the best of it by telling him if\r\nI remained I must send for some more. He also recommended me not to sleep\r\non the top of the house, but in my room, and shut the door. However, it\r\nis so hot that I should be suffocated if I were not to leave the door\r\nopen. In explanation, he said, \"The Touaricks and other strangers are\r\nthieves.\" The Rais is very sick, with bad eyes. Sent him some more\r\nphysic.\r\n\r\nWhilst writing my journal, the house is filled with Touaricks, and I\r\ncannot get rid of them. I am obliged therefore to enter into conversation\r\nto amuse them.\r\n\r\n\"How large is Ghat? as large as Ghadames?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bigger than Tripoli.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you plenty of meat in Ghat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of you--you killed one of my countrymen near Timbuctoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, (crying out lustily,) not the Touaricks of our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you take me safe to Ghat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon our lives!\" (_Drawing their swords across their foreheads._)\r\n\r\n\"Have you a written language?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your name?\" (The Touaricks to me.)\r\n\r\n\"Here, I will write it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any medicine for the eye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nI then applied some solution to the eyes of one of them. Another said:\r\n\r\n\"My son is always coughing. What shall I do for him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring him here,\" I said, \"in the morning, and I will give him\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n_The Touarick._--\"You won't poison him?\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"No, no.\"\r\n\r\nThey then entered upon a religious conversation.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of _religion_? Do you pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is one God.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, Mohammed?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the prophet of the _Arabs_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is your prophet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus; he is Prophet of all the Christians, as Moses is the prophet of\r\nthe Jews.\"\r\n\r\n(With impatience.) \"But Mohammed?\"\r\n\r\n\"We Christians have but one Prophet, who is Jesus.\"\r\n\r\nHere an interruption took place, of which I was very glad. Afterwards\r\nthey resumed:\r\n\r\n\"Have you any powder?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I am an English Marabout, and carry no arms, and have nothing to\r\ngive away but medicines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, an English Marabout, and not a merchant?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; only a Marabout.\"\r\n\r\nOne of them. \"We shall take your name as you have written it on this\r\npaper, and show it to our people. It will be esteemed precious by them;\r\nand if you ever wander that way through The Desert, they will ask you\r\nyour name, and, if you reply to it, they will not kill you, but give you\r\nplenty of camel's milk. If they have not your name they may kill you, and\r\nnot their fault.\"\r\n\r\nHad a visit from the Sheikh of the slaves. In most countries of North\r\nAfrica there is a chief appointed by Government for any particular race,\r\nnot the same as the ruling dynasty, domestic as well as foreign, which\r\nmay be resident in the towns and cities. So the Jews of Barbary have\r\ntheir chiefs, and the slaves theirs. In Tunis a number of free coloured\r\npeople, called _Waraghleeah_, emigrants from the Algerian oasis of\r\nWarklah, have also their chief or headsman. This chief has rather large\r\nand even discretionary powers, and can order his subjects to be\r\nimprisoned by the officers of the sovereign Government of the country.\r\nBut, of course, this imperium in imperio is subject to the supervision of\r\nthe supreme Government. The object is apparently to relieve the\r\nGovernment, but whilst it relieves the higher authorities, it inflicts\r\nirreparable injuries upon poor people, and is full of the most gigantic\r\nabuses. It is often complained of by the Levant correspondents of\r\nnewspapers, under the character of the various spiritual tribunals of\r\nEastern Christians inflicting fines, torture, and imprisonment on\r\nrefractory or heretic members of those churches. The Jewish synods of\r\nAfrica and the East exercise the same arbitrary powers, under the\r\nsanction of the supreme Mahometan authorities. Lately, however, the\r\nEuropean ambassadors have done something to check these abuses in the\r\ndominions of the Porte.\r\n\r\nAfter some conversation, I asked the Sheikh of the Ghadames slaves what\r\nwere his duties. Drawing himself up into a posture of authority, he\r\nreplied:--\"Be it known, Oh Christian! I am the Sheikh of the slaves, my\r\nname is Ahmed. I am from Timbuctoo. The people of Bambara are the finest\r\nin the world. They are brave--they fear none. Now, hear me: I know all\r\nthe names of the slaves in Ghadames: I watch over all their conduct, to\r\npunish them when they behave badly, to praise them when they do well.\r\nThey all fear me. For my trouble I receive nothing. I am a slave myself.\r\nI rarely punish the slaves. We have always here more than two hundred. If\r\nyou wait, plenty of slaves will soon come from Soudan!\"\r\n\r\nLate to-night, Mohammed the Marabout of Rujban, left for his country and\r\nTripoli. I gave him some Ghadames dates to take to Tripoli as presents,\r\nthe small black dates, as a rarity, and to let the people know I had not\r\nso much forgotten them as they had forgotten me. This clever, cunning,\r\nselfish fellow, I completely overreached. He never believed that I had\r\nthe courage to punish his bad conduct. I had promised him, besides the\r\nten mahboubs (about forty shillings), the hire of the two camels from\r\nTripoli to Ghadames, a present, or backsheesh of two mahboubs, on his\r\nbehaving well. On paying him his ten mahboubs I told him there was no\r\nbacksheesh. At first he was astonished and looked pale, shaking in every\r\nlimb, for he expected to reap a great harvest by my affair--even a double\r\npresent to what was promised. But on reflecting that he had lamed Said,\r\nwho was still laid up, had pilfered our provisions all the way, and lived\r\non us by force, although the agreement was that he should keep himself,\r\nhe confessed I was right, or thought it better to make the confession.\r\nHowever, he beat about the merchants, and got two or three of them to\r\ncome down to speak to me, who said, \"If he has done bad, treat him bad,\r\nthat is, give him a little backsheesh.\" I then gave him half a dollar.\r\nHis ingenuity was never exhausted. He pretended I ought to feed the\r\ncamels two or three days after their arrival, which he said was the rule.\r\nThere is no herbage for miles in the neighbourhood of Ghadames. The\r\npeople are sometimes obliged to drive their camels to Seenawan, or Derge,\r\ntwo or three days' distance, to feed. I gave way, and added a trifle. He\r\nthen begged something for his wife; he had bought her a pair of Ghadames\r\nshoes, worked with silk, which shows an Arab can have an affectionate\r\nremembrance for his wife, but which has been denied by some. I again\r\nadded something. He now had his supper. I gave him a feed of mutton, and\r\nbroth and bread. This was his feast before parting, for I did not like to\r\nsend him away as a blackguard, notwithstanding he had extremely annoyed\r\nme. I never saw a person eat with such voracity. After his allowance, or\r\nthe supper I had cooked him, a large supper was sent in by the Rais for\r\nthree. He set to and ate his own and Said's share in the bargain. I have\r\noften seen Arabs gorge in this way, but, what is most singular, when\r\nobliged to be abstemious they scarcely eat the amount of two penny loaves\r\nper day. Mohammed was a good type of this Arab abstemiousness and\r\nvoracity. When he kept himself, he only took a small and most frugal meal\r\nonce a day. Of his gluttony I may add, that I was obliged to separate his\r\nmess from that of Said when he dined with me. If not, he would eat Said's\r\nmess and his own before I could see what they were about. At last\r\nMohammed began to soften and to confess adroitly, for he was one of the\r\nacutest Arabs I ever met with. He observed to me, in a whining tone, \"Now\r\nI am going, I wish to tell you something. You think me very bad, and a\r\ngreat rogue, and so I am; but, I tell you, if you had had any other Arab\r\nyou would have found him a thousand times a bigger rogue than myself,\r\n_for all the Arabs are dogs_. This is the truth: (_El-khok_.)\" After this\r\nconfession, I gave him a certificate of my having arrived safe in\r\nGhadames under his guidance. This I could not object to do, in order that\r\nhe might show it to the Pasha and the English Consul. Some of his remarks\r\nwere full of _sel_, but mostly touched with selfishness. One evening,\r\nlooking at his camels feeding, he said, \"Ah, Yâkob, see those camels eat.\r\nIt does my heart good to see them, for what am I without my camels, what\r\nare the Arabs without the camels--are not the camels the pillars which\r\nsupport the Arab's house?\" At other times he would abuse his fellow\r\ncamel-drivers for coming into my tent, upbraiding them,--\"What, do you\r\nwant to rob The Christian? Am not I encharged with his affairs?\" Mohammed\r\nwas rather tall, and of lean habit of body, like all Arabs. His hearing\r\nand sight were very quick, and he always seemed to sleep like a\r\nwatch-dog. His bravery I never tested. He was mostly lively and\r\nfacetious. He was good-looking, and about thirty years of age.\r\n\r\nI saw him after my return to Tripoli. He wanted to go with me again. He\r\nsaid to me, \"Now you have seen all, The Mountains, The Sahara, and the\r\nTouaricks. You know all our affairs, and everything we do.\" As a\r\nliterary curiosity, I shall here translate my camel-driver's account of\r\nthe route from Tripoli to Ghadames, written at my request, in which will\r\nbe seen the camel-driver's minute acquaintance with the route, and how\r\nevery wady, and well, and mountain, is particularized. This is the style\r\nof the Saharan travellers and chroniclers.\r\n\r\n\"First Tripoli, and not far from it are palms of El-Hamabaj, and a mosque\r\nEl-Kajeej. You then proceed to Gargash, in which are palms, and along the\r\nroad the Kesar Jahaly. And you go on to Janzour, in which are palms and\r\ntwo castles, one of them is called Kesar Areek, and the Kesar of the\r\nTurkish soldiers (God curse them!) Upon the sea-shore is the mosque of\r\nSidi Abd-el-Jeleel. And you proceed to Seid, where are palms and the\r\nIndian fig. And you go on to Ghafeeah, and here is cool refreshing water,\r\n(oh! how delicious in the great heat!) and you pass the water to\r\nEl-Toubeem, where are palms, and mosques, and houses. You go on to\r\nZaweeah, where are palms, houses, and a Kesar for troops, and a Zaweeah\r\nfor the reading of The Sublime Koran, and mosques. You proceed thence to\r\nHoushel, in which are palms and houses. You move on to Aabareeah, where\r\nare palms. You now reach The Sahara, where there is a little sand; you\r\nfind in it the well of El-Hamra. Pursuing your way upon The Sahara, you\r\nfind the well of Esh-Shaibeeah. And travelling on The Sahara you find\r\nanother well called Lakhreej. You travel further on The Sahara, and find\r\nAfoub Aaly, where there is sand, called El-Hal. And after it, you find\r\nWady Lethel, in which are lote-trees and the lethel, a large tree like an\r\nolive-tree. And you travel to El-Jibel, where are houses and a Kesar for\r\ntroops. In the country called Yefran, are olive-trees and fig-trees; and\r\nbelow the country (or in the plains), you find palms. And near El-Gibel,\r\nin all the countries you find olive-trees and fig-trees, as far as the\r\nother mountains westward. Now Rujban (my happy country, the blessing of\r\nGod on it!) has seven countries, viz.:--El-Barahem, and Tarkat, and\r\nSharn, and Zâferan, and Ghalat, and Zantan, and Tarbeeah.\r\n\r\n\"We mounted from Rujban and from El-Gibel, and went to Eth-Tha, where is\r\nKoteet, between Ez-Zantan and Rujban. Thence we travelled to Wady\r\nSouk-ej-Jeen. Thence to Haram and Et-Teen. And we travelled to\r\nWady-Azgheer, and afterwards Wady Walas. Thence we arrived again on The\r\nSahara, called El-Hamrad, which is _fertile_[20] land, and on it are\r\nlote-trees, bearing berries (_nebek_). Now, oh Yâkob! this is not the\r\nlote-tree in the seventh heaven, near the presence of Rubbee (God), and\r\nwhich Gabriel, nor our lord Mahomet, dare not pass beyond. Alas! O Yâkob,\r\nif you believe not in Mahomet, you cannot be near this lote-tree. It says\r\nin the Koran, 'It covers the concealed[21].' And we ascended a hill,--a\r\nhigh hill, that is to say, a little mountain. And we ascended\r\n(descended?) to a wady, called Ahween, in which is a well on the west of\r\nthe route. And after this is Eshâab, small wadys, called Eshâab\r\nEth-Thoueeb, and after them is Wady Seelas, where there is a well of\r\nwater. You pass by it on the road, and come to Seenawan, in which is a\r\nspring of water, called Spring Aly. In Seenawan are palms, and its\r\n_ghotbah_ is like a tower (burge), built with small stones, and so of\r\nthe country (village) near it. And after this is the country Esh-Shâour,\r\nwhere there is water from springs which run upon the face of the earth,\r\nand palms and houses built with small stones. From The Mountains to\r\nSeenawan are four days with heavily laden camels.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards you travel and find Wady Babous Eth-Theeb. Thence there is\r\nland, on which is sand, and in this the well of water El-Wateeah. After\r\nthere is Wady Ej-Jeefah. Then Saheer El-Maharee, and then a long stream,\r\nin which are reeds. Afterwards you find Hinsheer El-Basasah. And after\r\nEl-Bab-Rumel (\"gate of sand\"), a difficult place. Thence you come to\r\nEmjessem. All this route is Sahara; and the road from Seenawan to\r\nEmjessen is two days' journey. After this you find the small mountains\r\nBaârbeeah Aghour. Then you find Ghadames. There is a day's journey from\r\nEmjessen to Ghadames.\"\r\n\r\n_28th._--Early this morning made the tour of the city's walls and\r\ngardens. Went with Said, and myself, alone. I am fond of being alone, and\r\nwould sometimes walk miles over The Desert--the caravans being not even\r\nin sight. This _was_ solitude!\r\n\r\n                  \"I love all waste\r\n    And solitary places; where we taste\r\n    The pleasure of believing what we see\r\n    Is boundless, as we wish our souls to be.\"\r\n\r\nIt occupied us, at a moderate rate of walking, about an hour and a half,\r\nso that the oasis may be about five miles in circumference. What a scene\r\nof hideous desolation did the environs present--nor tree, nor herb, nor\r\nliving creature! Talk of the Poles, there is less life here! On the\r\nwest, the groups of sand-hills, which stretch ten days' journey, were all\r\nbright as the light, and sometimes not visible from brilliancy. Some\r\nTouaricks saw us going, and called after us; we took no notice of them.\r\nThe Rais, on my return, asked many questions, about what I thought of the\r\ncity, and observed, \"These poor fools think there's no city like theirs,\r\nbut what would they think if they saw Stamboul? Those who have not seen\r\nStamboul have not seen the world!\" The walls of the city of Ghadames,\r\nlike the houses, are built mostly of sun-dried bricks, but parts of small\r\nstones and earth. They are in a ruinous condition, and in many places\r\nopen to The Desert. But within these outer walls are garden-walls and\r\nwinding paths, so that the approaches to the city are difficult, except\r\nby the southern gate. Formerly, four or five gates were open, but the\r\nRais has shut them all but this one for security, as well as facility in\r\ncollecting the octroi, or gate-dues.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the camels of our ghafalah left today, but unladen,\r\nthere being no Soudan goods now in Ghadames. These camels belong to The\r\nMountains, and are hired by the merchants to convey their goods between\r\nthis and Tripoli. The ordinary price paid is two dollars per camel. The\r\nweight the camel carries is from two to three cantars.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon had a visit from the Touarick women, and was astonished to\r\nfind some of them _almost fair_. They were pretty and plump, coquettish\r\nand saucy, asking a thousand questions. It is evident the men are dark\r\nsimply from exposure to the sun. I regaled them with _medicine_ and tea.\r\nThis party belongs nearly all to Touat. They want to prevail upon me to\r\ngo with them. I am almost inclined. Two men, who came with the women,\r\nassured me I should go safe and sound. I believe I could, provided I go\r\nas poor as a beggar, distributing only medicines. This evening dined\r\nagain with the Rais. He is now a little better, and puts his charms over\r\nhis eyes, as if the charms cured them, and not the caustic of nitrate of\r\nsilver. His Excellency talked of the affairs of the city; he pretends the\r\nantiquity of Ghadames goes back four thousand years, to the times of\r\nNimrod and Abraham. The people of the town, I suppose, have told him so;\r\nbut where is their authority? He says of _present_ matters,--\"The people\r\npay 6,000 mahboubs per annum; it is too small a sum for a city of\r\nmerchants; there is little money in the country, it being mostly\r\ndeposited in the hands of merchants in Tripoli; he wishes Christians\r\nestablished here, and a regular souk, or market, opened; the number of\r\nArab troops which he has here is 120; he is building barracks and a\r\nfondouk at Emjessen, in order to station troops there to guard the wells,\r\nfor the banditti come there and drink water, and then lie in ambush to\r\nplunder caravans.\" This building of forts at wells is a wise and\r\nefficient measure; the same thing has been done at the oasis of Derge.\r\nThe Rais receives his pay _direct_ from the Sultan of Constantinople; his\r\nappointment is quite uncertain; he is a native of Erzeroum; he took part\r\nin the Turco-English campaign in Syria, served under General Jochmus, and\r\nwas acquainted with many English officers. He has been at Constantinople,\r\nSmyrna, Malta, and many other parts of the Upper Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nPeople complain that the gardens languish for want of money to cultivate\r\nthem; not more than half of the date-trees bear fruit this year, owing\r\nentirely to the want of labour and irrigation. People have to purchase\r\nwater. I have seen no birds in the oasis up to this time.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of yesterday and to-day occupied in distributing\r\nmedicines. Afraid I shall soon finish my stock. The medicines were\r\nfurnished by the British Consul-General of Tripoli, at the expense of\r\nGovernment; there were only five pounds-sterling worth. Ramadan begins in\r\na few days; then I shall not have so many customers. Then the Moors cast\r\nphysic to the dogs.\r\n\r\n_29th._--Went this morning to see the Souk. At the time of my visit there\r\nwere only a few tomatas, peppers, a little olive-oil, and some grain,\r\nwheat and barley, exposed for sale. Passed a butcher's, where a whole\r\ncamel was killed and cut up. Told in this way it fetches about thirty\r\nshillings. Paid a visit to my runaway Turjeman, who said he would call\r\nupon me this evening.\r\n\r\nObserve the Rais employs, in his administration, all strangers, either\r\nArabs or Tripolines, or people from Derge and Seenawan. How true are the\r\nprinciples of despotism! This is upon the same principle as the\r\nemployment of the Swiss at Naples; in both cases the despotic government\r\ncannot trust the people. The Rais is very busy in collecting the\r\nhalf-yearly tax: he works with surprising zeal from morning to night--a\r\nzeal worthy of a better cause.\r\n\r\nI am told the nearest route from here to Tunis is _viâ_ Douwarat (or\r\nDuerat), a portion of the Atlas where is situate Shninnee. This village,\r\nscattered over all the hills, is three days from Ghabs and seven from\r\nGhadames. The Souf Arabs tell me there is no water for seven days in\r\nsummer and twelve in winter, on the road they came from their country to\r\nGhadames, the difference being the length of days. The well is called\r\nBeer-es-Saf, and sometimes Beer-ej-Jadeed. The route lies entirely\r\nthrough sand, N.W. This region of sand is the celebrated hunting-place of\r\nthe Souf Arabs.\r\n\r\nDined again with the Rais this evening. His Excellency complained that\r\nthe Ghadamsee people show him scarcely any attention. He never receives\r\nthe smallest present, neither a few dates, nor a melon, nor a vegetable;\r\nhe buys and is obliged to buy everything[22]. I thought myself more\r\nfortunate than the Rais, for I have received several little presents from\r\nvarious individuals. His Excellency says he never punishes the people\r\nexcept for _abusive language_ to one another, and than he only gives them\r\ntwenty or fifty strokes of the bastinado. In this respect he says,\r\n\"Ghadames may be compared to Paradise, there being no crime in it.\" His\r\nExcellency repeated that the greater number of the resident inhabitants,\r\nwho do not travel abroad, spend their time in reading, writing, and\r\nprayer--that, emphatically, this is _a Marabout city_.\r\n\r\n_30th._--Occupied two or three hours this morning in administering\r\nmedicine and visiting the sick. My turjeman came back and apologized; he\r\nsaid the people were fanatic. Received a visit from Haj-el-Beshir, eldest\r\nson of the Sheikh Makouran. He said his father had been twice to\r\nTimbuctoo, and resident there many years, and would give me some\r\ninformation. The Rais says there's no Sheikh of the slaves, and adds,\r\n\"I'm the Sheikh of the slaves.\" This again is not correct, as the people\r\nall told me, there must be a headman or Sheikh of the slaves in all\r\ncountries. Had a visit from two young men who were quite free from the\r\nprejudices of their countrymen. They told me to take courage, \"that God\r\nwas the Maker of Christians as well as Mohammedans, that in this city no\r\none could do me harm, but I was not to expose myself to the ignorant.\" I\r\nseem, indeed, to get on better with the people, their prejudices\r\napparently are beginning to give way; I shall be able to open the way for\r\nsome other person. The father of one of my young friends has been now\r\ntwelve years in Kanou; when he returns he brings a fortune.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to the Rais of the Ghadamsee people, I asked him what they did\r\nfor soldiers before the Turks came? He replied, \"These people are not\r\nsoldiers and never had soldiers; they are like women and children; if any\r\nbody came from The Desert to plunder, he stole what he pleased and was\r\nallowed to go away unmolested. They depended upon God and prayer for\r\ntheir protection. You see I told you these people were dervishes.\" Still\r\nthere is reason to believe that if they did not fight themselves, as, at\r\nthe present time, they got their quondam but powerful friends, the\r\nTouaricks, to fight for them.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon saw some doves in the gardens; and also a small flight of\r\nbirds hovering over the city, perhaps there were twenty. These birds were\r\ncalled _arnout_, and have very long bills and necks. When the men leave\r\noff working at the wells, they dart down to drink. The palm-groves are\r\nthe favourite resort of the doves, as poetical as natural. Animals, and\r\nespecially birds, are so rare in those regions that every sight of them\r\nis worthy of mention; indeed, these are the first birds I have seen since\r\nI left Tripoli. No meat to be had to-day in Souk. People usually club\r\ntogether and buy a whole sheep: they then kill it, and divide it into so\r\nmany portions according to the number of purchasers; so that meat is\r\nrarely exposed publicly for sale, and it is necessary to join these\r\nprivate purchasers. Purchase-money is always paid down at once and not on\r\ndelivery. The meat is never weighed but divided at guess. When any\r\ndisagreement takes place lots are drawn for the division.\r\n\r\nDuring the four or five days of my residence here, the weather has been\r\ncomparatively temperate; at least, I have not felt the heat excessive.\r\nTo-day has been close and cloudy: no sun in the afternoon: wind hot,\r\n_ghiblee_. I continue to be an object of curiosity amongst the people,\r\nand am followed by troops of boys. A black from Timbuctoo was astonished\r\nat the whiteness of my skin, and swore I was bewitched. The Ghadamsee\r\nMoors eat sugar like children, and are as much pleased with a suck of it.\r\nThe young men carry it about in little bags to suck. The Rais is\r\nsometimes called _Bey_ by the people and sometimes _Sultan_, but by the\r\nlow people, not the better classes. Here, as elsewhere, the lower classes\r\nare the more servile.\r\n\r\n_31st._--Went this morning to buy meat, but got some with great\r\ndifficulty. Passed some Touaricks, who showed an excessive arrogance in\r\ntheir manners. They look upon the Ghadamsee people with great disdain,\r\nconsidering them as so many sheep which they are to protect from the\r\nwolves of The Sahara. Met several of the merchants I knew at Tripoli.\r\nThey asked me how I liked their city, and if better than Tripoli. I\r\nalways replied, _Haier_ (better). It is singular that though these\r\nmerchants are so enterprising themselves in the interior of Africa, they\r\ncannot conceive of the possibility of a Christian coming so far from home\r\ninto The Desert, and when I tell them I wish to go to Soudan, or Bornou,\r\nor Timbuctoo, they look at me with incredulity and say, \"No, no, you\r\ncannot go so far, you will die, or the people will kill you.\" They have\r\nnot the least idea of the courage and enterprise of European tourists,\r\nnor can they understand their objects. But these their objections may be\r\nfounded in jealousy of us Christians.\r\n\r\nThe following is a nice neat facsimile specimen of the writing of a young\r\ntaleb and Ghadamsee Marabout, one of the best I have seen in The Desert.\r\nIt is a bill of sale, consisting of gold--slaves, male and\r\nfemale--bullocks' skins--pillow-cases--elephant's teeth--senna--bekhour\r\n(perfume)--camels--sacks--and (I think) household slaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe young taleb showed great consequence and presented me with the\r\noriginal. He observed that a metegal of gold is of the value of 33½\r\nTunisian piastres. I said, \"Will you come to my house and I will show you\r\nan Arabic book (the Bible) containing the religion of the Jews and\r\nChristians?\"\r\n\r\n_The Taleb_: \"I, I enter the house of an infidel! God preserve me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" I observed, \"you are afraid of me and my books--my books _will bite\r\nyou_.\" Hereupon all the people present burst into a loud laugh, and the\r\ntaleb looked quite crest-fallen.\r\n\r\nMany people blind with one eye, and some with two eyes, come to me to be\r\ncured, but I can do nothing for them. One poor old man comes every\r\nmorning. I wash his eyes with a solution of the Goulard powders. He,\r\nthough nearly seventy years of age, still lives in the hopes of\r\nrecovering his sight. How faithful a companion of the unfortunate is\r\nhope! The Touaricks use mustard for bad fingers and hands. They also cut\r\nand carve their backs for blood-letting, and the marks remain for years\r\nupon years. I saw one of them whose back was scarred and scarified all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThis morning visited my turjeman at his house. The house is a\r\n_mezzonina_, having no ground-floor apartments; the parlour, or grand\r\nroom, or hall, was surrounded, to my surprise, with small apartments, in\r\nwhich three or four sheep were fattening, as people fatten pigs. The\r\nsheep is with the Ghadamsee people what the pig is with the Irish, their\r\n_dii penates_. There was also another story above this, the\r\nsleeping-room; and then on the terrace, or flat roof, are other little\r\nrooms. All the apartments were exceedingly small, but their situation\r\nhigh. Stone stairs lead from one room to another. The turjeman told me\r\nall the houses were built in the same manner, but some larger. Indeed\r\nsome houses are four stories high, besides the terrace. The lower rooms\r\nare mostly used as magazines. As soon as I ascended the staircase, the\r\nwife of the turjeman pretended to take fright, and hid herself in a\r\nprivate apartment. At another time when I called, and her husband was\r\nabsent, she came out to see me, and collected all the women in two or\r\nthree neighbours' houses to see The Christian. It is the husband the\r\nwoman of Africa is frightened at, and not the stranger. The tyranny of\r\nmen over the sex of feebler bodily frame is co-extensive with the\r\npopulation of the world. It is the same in Paris, in London, Calcutta,\r\nand The Desert. But the principle of women-seeing in Ghadames and all\r\nNorth Africa is simply this: \"If the woman is poor, or the husband poor,\r\nshe may be seen; if rich, she cannot be seen.\" A pretty woman will,\r\nhowever, always try to let you see her face if she can.\r\n\r\nThere is a very good-natured black dervish always about the streets, but\r\nclean and well-dressed. Ordinarily amongst these saints filth and piety\r\ngo hand in hand. They abhor the proverb of cleanliness being next to\r\ngodliness. The poor fellow is very fond of me, is running in and out of\r\nmy house all day long. I always shake hands with him when I meet him. The\r\nMoors approve my conduct and say: \"Ah, Yâkob, he's a saint.\" Once the\r\ncunning fellow, when he noticed a lot of half-caste women anxious to see\r\nme, took hold of my head and turned me completely round to show my face\r\nto them. He has some sense, good simpleton, and is without malice;\r\nconsequently a great favourite with the people. A pity all madmen were\r\nnot like this poor dervish. Yet how many would be as harmless and beloved\r\nas he if they were not confined, and caged, and chained, in civilized and\r\nChristian madhouses! The dog knows I'm a _kafer_, and said to my\r\ncamel-driver, the day of my arrival, \"Why did you bring the Christian to\r\nour holy city?\" chiding him.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon we went to see the Touaricks \"play with\r\ncamels\"--‮يلعبوا مع الجمل‬--that is,\r\nperform a sort of camel-race. Strange coincidence of civilized and\r\nbarbarian life! This was the Epsom and Ascot of The Desert. But I\r\nwas never more disappointed. All that the Touaricks did with their\r\ncamels was, they dressed them out most fantastically with various\r\ncoloured leather harness, that is to say, the withers, neck, and\r\nhead; they reined them up tightly like blood-horses; and then rode\r\nthem a full trot in couples. This was the whole of the grand play\r\nwith camels. Some, however, would not fall into this trot of\r\ncouples, and grumbled terrifically. The Touaricks who rode these\r\nrestive camels were saluted by the spectators with loud laughter,\r\nthe effect of which was painted sullenly in their faces. I never saw\r\nmen look so _couldn't help it_ like. One of them was a young\r\nTouarick who had been saucy to me. I was not displeased to see him\r\nin this _triste_ position. The camels were the genuine Maharee, of\r\ncourse; the Touaricks have no other camels. The men were dressed out\r\nalso in their gayest barbaric finery. A tent was dressed up, around\r\nwhich squatted a group of Desert jockies, with their fierce spears\r\nbristling above in the sun before them, like the lords of creation.\r\nEven a banner floated gaily in the bright sun from the tent top. A\r\ngreat concourse of Ghadamsee spectators were present, one of whom\r\nswore to me that a Maharee once passed from Ghadames to Tripoli IN\r\nONE DAY, but that the rider died instantly from exhaustion, on his\r\narrival. Another Maharee outstripped the wind, but as it was a\r\nstrong cold wind, the animal died when it got into hot atmosphere,\r\nto which the tempest was driving.\r\n\r\nHad a long conversation with a Touarick about a journey to Timbuctoo. I\r\noffered him five hundred dollars to escort me; but, to deposit the money\r\nin the hands of the Governor of Ghadames, or a respectable merchant, till\r\nmy and his safe return. Said I would take nothing with me but medicines,\r\nand a little provision, and go in _formâ pauperis_, as a dervish or\r\ndoctor. All the Ghadamsee people present approved this way of going, and\r\nadmired its wisdom, as removing all temptation to attack me, or to steal\r\nanything from me when I had nothing to steal. But the Touarick could not\r\ncome up to the scratch, and was frightened to take upon himself the\r\nresponsibility, observing, \"You are a Christian; the people of Timbuctoo\r\nwill kill you unless you confess Mahomet to be the prophet of God.\"\r\n\r\nDined this evening with the Rais. His Excellency said: \"Formerly, when\r\nGhadames was governed by the Moorish Bashaws, the people paid little or\r\nnothing. There are but three or four rich persons now here, the rest are\r\npoor, or have only a few mahboubs to carry on a petty trade.\" At night,\r\nthe streets are enveloped in pitch darkness, whether the moon be up or\r\nnot. I endeavoured to persuade the Rais to make the people light up the\r\ntown with a few lamps, having oil enough in them to last till midnight.\r\n\"Good,\" he observed, \"but the people say it was always so, and it must be\r\nso still. What can I do?\" There are no coffee-houses in Ghadames; people\r\ndrink coffee inside their houses. I threatened the merchants to set up\r\nSaid as a _kahwagee_, (coffee-house keeper). They laughed, and said,\r\n\"None will buy.\" For conversation people collect in groups round shops,\r\nin the _Souk_, or in little squares near the mosques, where there are\r\nmany stone benches for reclining on, or in some quiet dark nook and\r\ncorner, where, when you expect to find no one, you fall foul of a retired\r\ncircle of gossips, squatting down in utter darkness. These Saharan\r\nstreets are veritable catacombs.\r\n\r\n_1st September._--This morning, wonderful! It broke with a few drops of\r\nrain; to me most pleasant, and welcomed as falling pearls of nectar. At\r\nnoon the sky became as dry and inflamed as ever. Went to the Spring early\r\nto bathe. Found it surrounded with women, nearly all half-castes and\r\nfemale slaves. They pretended to be in a great fright, as all were\r\nwashing and dabbling in the water. I came away. A man said, \"The\r\nChristian must not go to the well in the morning, but only in the\r\nevening.\" There seems to be a tacit understanding, that from day-break to\r\na couple of hours afterwards, the women shall have possession of the\r\nwell, for purification purposes, according to the rites of religion.\r\n\r\nThis morning took coffee with the Rais; as no one was present, he began\r\ntalking politics. \"By a little and a little,\" he said, \"we shall take\r\npossession of Ghat. We can't do it by force, it would require some\r\nthousand men to take it by arms. The Touaricks are all robbers and\r\ndevils.\" I asked him if he would not like to occupy Touat. He replied,\r\n\"No, there's another Sultan there, and another people. There are two\r\nSultans in the world, one in the East and one in the West\r\n(_Muley-Abd-Errahman_). Ghat we might take. At Touat we are too near the\r\nFrench, and might quarrel with them. All the freebooters come from Tunis.\r\nThe Bey has no power or authority over the Arabs there. His government is\r\nbad; he's a madman. Our Pasha has often written to him about these\r\nfreebooters, but it's no use. The English and the Sultan are one, and\r\nalways friends, whatever may be the condition of the rest of the world.\"\r\nSpeaking of me:--\"You are mad to think of going to Timbuctoo; you are\r\nsure to have your throat cut.\"\r\n\r\nI allow all persons, rich and poor, young and old, men and women, to come\r\nand see me. At the same time I make a distinction between those who are\r\nlikely to be useful to me and mere idle intruders. All the Arab soldiers\r\ncome, and, in general, though poor and thievish, they have less of\r\nprejudices, and like the English better than the Ghadamsee people. This\r\ncity has not yet felt the benefit of English influence, and interference\r\nin Tripoli, and therefore the merchants have not the same reasons for\r\nbeing friendly to the English as the Arabs of The Mountains and the\r\ntownspeople of Tripoli. All the Ghadamseeah agree with me, that the\r\ncamel-playing of the Touaricks was a failure. Five slaves are leaving for\r\nTripoli. The poor things complained of having nothing to eat; I sent Said\r\nwith some victuals for them. The people continue to be friendly, and the\r\nmerchants, whose acquaintance I made in Tripoli, very much so. The\r\nsteward of the Rais has arrived from Tripoli in fourteen days. His whole\r\nparty consisted of six camels and five persons. So much for the pretended\r\ninsecurity of the route! He is dressed in the Turco-European costume,\r\nlike indeed the Rais himself. To-day the mother of Essnousee, my friend,\r\nwas bitten by a scorpion. I administered Goulard solution to the part,\r\nand gave her fever-powder, as she was very hot and her belly swollen. She\r\ndied the next day.\r\n\r\nDined again with the Rais. He says, scorpions are in great numbers in\r\nthis city, because it is ancient, and particularly they abound in the old\r\nmosques where the people do not live or perform domestic matters. \"No\r\nperson,\" he added, \"is secure from them, and it is all destined whether\r\nwe are bitten, and die or not.\" The Touarick again assured me that he\r\nspoke the truth, he did not flatter me, by telling me he could take me to\r\nTimbuctoo, when he could not; but yet, if I could make friends with some\r\nrespectable merchant of Touat, they might succeed. A son of the Sheikh\r\nMakouran is now in Timbuctoo. The Sheikh himself gave me a detailed\r\naccount of the city; he has been there twice. The old gentleman, when he\r\nhad finished his narrative, thought the time was come for me to assist\r\nhim. He begged me to intercede with the British Consul at Tripoli for\r\nhim, that he might not be taxed by the Bashaw so much. He now pays two\r\nhundred dollars per annum, assessed taxes. He assured me that all the\r\nmoney is leaving the country, and Ghadames will soon be without a para,\r\nlike the rest of Tripoli. He told me frankly that he had the idea of\r\nmaking me a partner in his firm, to get my protection, but on hearing I\r\nwas opposed to slave-dealing, it could not be done, as he and all the\r\nmerchants were obliged to deal in slaves. Indeed, the obstacle of\r\nEnglish merchants joining the Tripoline is at present insuperable, on\r\naccount of the slave traffic; if they could unite in one firm, it would\r\nbe equally advantageous for both parties.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--Not so many patients this morning. A respectable Ghadamsee came\r\nto me to beg medicine to assist in conjugal pleasures. I told him to eat,\r\ndrink, and take a journey from home for two months.\r\n\r\nAlthough, according to the Italian almanack, the new moon is on the 1st,\r\nyet as the people have not seen it, there is no Ramadan, (properly\r\n_Ramtham_.) The Rais says, after the first ten days' keeping the fast it\r\nis not difficult, but, during this period, the adult Mussulmans suffer\r\nexceedingly. Afraid I shall find them all ill-natured during the fast.\r\nBesides, they can't stomach seeing Infidels eat, whilst they the Faithful\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nSupped with the Rais. His fowl flew away, and left him without meat for\r\nsupper. \"_Maktoub_,\" he said, laughing. The Mussulmans are extravagantly\r\nfond of rice, but they never prepare it in that nice delicious way in\r\nwhich we do, with milk, or in rice pudding. It is always covered with\r\nfat, and soon surfeits one. His Excellency and his servants played\r\npractical jokes on the black dervish. First, they bastinadoed the\r\ndervish, and then he bastinadoed the Rais's servants. But the dervish did\r\nit in reality, and so effectually, that after two or three strokes, they\r\njumped up, for he laid it on under all the force of his witless revenge.\r\nWhen in a passion, or excited, he speaks his native lingo of Soudan, but\r\nwhen cool he speaks Arabic and Ghadamsee. He became mad, _en route_, by\r\ngrief in being ravished from his country. These practical jokes were\r\nplayed off under the sanction of his Excellency, before all the people in\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent diseases at this season, are diarrhœa and ophthalmia, with\r\noccasional cases of fever. The diarrhœa arises from the people's eating\r\nunripe or bad fruit, particularly melons, the ophthalmia from frequent\r\nexposure to the sun during the past hot months. The camel-drivers also\r\nbring it into the city, and it is so propagated by infection. One of my\r\npatients is dead, a little boy, afflicted with diarrhœa for three months.\r\nHis father, in relating his death to me, spoke with a resignation which\r\nmight be imitated, but could not be surpassed by a Christian. It is\r\namazing how the thought of all-powerful and resistless destiny calms the\r\nmind, and tones it down to a speechless patience! My stock of drugs is\r\nfast going. It consisted originally of worm-powders, emetics (of which\r\nthe Arabs and Moors are very fond), fever powders, purgative pills, Epsom\r\nsalts, compound opium pills, Goulard powders, eye powders, sulphate of\r\nquinine pills, and solution of nitrate of silver. They were made up by\r\nDr. Dickson, of Tripoli. I was surprised to find nothing for pectoral\r\ncomplaints. Many persons here are troubled with chronic diseases of this\r\nsort. Although administering medicines these eight days to some fifty\r\npersons or more, not one of them has offered me anything in turn. There\r\nare no guinea or five-guinea fees here. On the contrary, some have asked\r\nme for sugar and money before they could be persuaded to take the\r\nmedicine. Such is the consolation of doing good. Verily the philosopher\r\nhad it when he said, \"Virtue must be loved for its own sake.\" Here I may\r\nmention that the Commandant Omer of our caravan got into a great passion\r\nbecause I would not buy him a pair of shoes, and left for The Mountains,\r\nwithout coming to bid me good bye. He had had coffee and tea, and\r\nprovisions always with me, _en route_, and I thought this enough. Unless\r\nthe last favour or request is granted, all former favours are counted\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--The morning opens cool and pleasant, and the heat begins\r\ngradually to leave us. People expect rain in ten days.\r\n\r\nAnother Touarick has come forward to offer to conduct me to Timbuctoo. He\r\nsays now is the time to go, when it is hot the banditti do not infest the\r\nroutes, for they find no water to drink. He offers to take me for five\r\nhundred dollars, which is to be deposited in the hands of the Sheikh\r\nMakouran, and is not to be paid until our safe return. He will allow me\r\nto stop a month or six weeks in the city of Timbuctoo. The distances of\r\nroutes which he gives me, are the same as those on M. Carette's map,\r\nattached to his brochure on the commerce of The Desert. Of all the French\r\nwriters who have recently written on Africa, M. Carette is most correct.\r\nWrote down a vocabulary of Ghadamsee words from my turjeman's dictation.\r\nWhilst I was lamenting the little gratitude, or rather none, which the\r\npeople showed for my medicines, an old man, to whose mother-in-law (he\r\nhaving married a woman forty years younger than himself, frequently the\r\ncase here,) I gave some pills, brought me a melon, and said he should\r\nbring also some dates. I was conversing with a group at the time, and I\r\ntook the opportunity of observing that doctors were paid amongst us. An\r\nupstart man angrily replied:--\"Yes, but we are the chosen people of God!\r\nyou Infidels are bound to serve us in every way, and ought to be thankful\r\nthat you are so honoured as to be the servants and slaves of The\r\nMoumeneen. You think you are clever, but your talents are not your own;\r\nyour knowledge comes from God.\" These affronting words contain a common\r\nfanatic sentiment of Barbary. I made no reply.\r\n\r\nWent at noon to visit the Arab suburb, and was a great curiosity amongst\r\nthe women and children. Some of the little girls were frightened out of\r\ntheir wits, but the boys took up stones to pelt me. The suburb contains\r\nabout five hundred souls; the houses are all miserable, and the people\r\npoor. A genuine Ghadamsee would not live here without being degraded: it\r\nis the St. Giles of the city. Went into a house, the walls of which were\r\ncompletely concealed beneath the covers for dishes and meats, bowls and\r\ncalabashes, the greater part brought from Soudan. The people were dealers\r\nin them. Talking with the Rais about Soudan, he displayed the usual\r\nignorance of Mussulmans, even in The Desert, of this country. It would\r\ntake a person five years to travel through that vast country, many parts\r\nof which were populated by cannibals. We read of the Lemlems, Lamlams,\r\nand the Yemyems, as cannibals, somewhere in the neighbourhood of Zegzeg\r\nand Yakobah; but after conversing with several of the merchants who have\r\nscoured Soudan and Bornou, I have not found one who has seen these\r\nterrible cannibals. They have all _heard_ of them. It appears to me to be\r\nan ancient tale of wonder to adorn the narratives of travellers.\r\n\r\nThis evening being that previous to the Ramadan, a great outcry was made\r\nto see the moon. According to my Italian almanack it should be three\r\ndays' old, the geographical position of the two countries may make a\r\ndifference as to a sight of it. There is a little display of firing off\r\npistols, chiefly by boys. A vast number of persons question me, as to\r\nwhether I shall fast (_soum_) to-morrow; and a Touarick goes bolt up to\r\nthe Governor, and says, to his Excellency, pointing to where I am\r\nsitting,--\"Does this (man) fast?\" His Excellency shakes his head and\r\nlaughs gravely. To questions put direct to me, I answer, \"a little.\" A\r\nboy says to me, \"Why, how now, every body fasts, and you don't fast!\" It\r\nis, however, prudent to avoid all these questions. I told some more\r\nliberal:--\"The English eat and drink at all seasons that which is good;\r\nbut some Christian nations occasionally fast.\" According to the Moslemite\r\nrite here observed, all under _thirteen_ may eat during the Ramadan; but,\r\nother authorities tell me, all under _eight_. Those who travel are\r\nexcused for the time being. The fast endures thirty days. Another patient\r\nbrought me a few dates. In time I may alter my opinion of Ghadamsee\r\ngratitude. Some new patients, nearly all ophthalmia and diarrhœa.\r\n\r\nVisited to-day the two wells, which serve a portion of the population, in\r\naddition to the great spring. It is surprising what an interest I take in\r\nwater. It is to me like precious gold, and the most fine gold. One of\r\nthese wells has better water than the central running spring. They are\r\nlarge wells, but do not run like the great spring: they are also only a\r\nlittle warm. In the winter they rise higher, showing some connexion with\r\nthe rainy season in the _rainy_ region. Two men were employed in drawing\r\nwater in a curious manner. The other buckets were not being worked. One\r\nend of the shaft is made very heavy, so as to assist in bringing up the\r\nwater by over-balancing on a swivel; the other end, to which the cord and\r\nbucket is attached, is correspondingly light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe houses of Ghadamsee are one, two, three, four, and even five stories\r\nhigh; the greater part three or four stories. The architecture is\r\nordinarily Moorish, with some Saharan fantastic peculiarities. The public\r\nbuildings offer nothing remarkable; even the mosques, in a place so\r\ndevoted to religion, have no pretty minarets. There are four large\r\nmosques, viz.: Jemâ Kebir,--Tinghaseen,--Yerasen,--Eloweenah; and many\r\nsmaller mosques and sanctuaries. The streets are all covered in and dark,\r\n(a peculiarity prevailing in many Saharan cities,) with here and there\r\nopen spaces or little squares, of which there are several to let in the\r\nlight of heaven. They are small and narrow, and winding, not more than a\r\ncouple of camels can pass abreast, the ceiling however being high enough\r\nto admit the entrance of the tall Maharee camel. A camel of this species\r\nentered to-day: it amazed me by its stupendous height; a person of\r\naverage size might have walked under its belly. The principal streets and\r\nsquares are lined with stone-benches, on which the people loungingly\r\nrecline or stretch themselves. Both houses and streets are admirably\r\nadapted for the climate, protecting the inhabitants alike from the fiery\r\nglare of the summer's sun, and the keen blasts of the winter's cold.\r\nBefore the Rais Mustapha's appointment, the city had, besides smaller and\r\ninner gates, four principal ones, viz., Bab-el-Manderah, Bab-esh-Shydah,\r\nBab-el-Mishrah, and Bab-el-Bur (\"gate of the country\"), all of which,\r\nexcept the last on the south-west, are now closed, with respect to the\r\nentrance of goods and camels. The city is situate on the south-east side\r\nof the plantations of palms and gardens, not in the central part of the\r\noasis. I asked the talebs the meaning of some of the names of the gates,\r\nbut they could not tell. Many proper names of places and persons, amongst\r\nthem as with us, have now no assignable meaning or derivation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Here we find The Sahara called _fertile_ land; and, in fact,\r\n    many parts of The Desert could be cultivated.\r\n\r\n[21] See Surat Liii., entitled \"The Star.\"\r\n\r\n[22] This complaint is not well founded, for afterwards I saw the\r\n    Rais often receive presents of fruit, tobacco, sugar, and even\r\n    wearing apparel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE FAST OF THE RAMADAN.\r\n\r\n     Deathly stillness of the City on first morning of the\r\n     Ramadan.--Rais weighing Gold.--The Gold Country.--Use of\r\n     different Arabic terms in different Countries.--Insecurity of\r\n     Merchants in The Desert.--Jews on the borders of The Sahara.--Sin\r\n     not to Marry.--Wood in The Sahara.--Rais, a Marabout.--Sheikh of\r\n     Slaves.--Complaints of the People to me.--Mr. Frederick\r\n     Warrington.--M.

A paralysis of death seemed to have stricken the city. Had\r\nno morning patients for the same reason. Afterwards, the servants of the\r\nRais came to visit me and found me taking coffee; they gaped with full\r\n(empty?) open mouths, as if wondering I was not choked. I asked them if\r\nthe Rais would take his tea. \"It's unlawful,\" they screamed, and ran away\r\nas if Old Nick were after them. Usually make tea for the Governor every\r\nmorning, which I send him in a glass, and sometimes also for the Sheikh\r\nMakouran. I could not help thanking God that I was born a Protestant, and\r\nprofessed a religion not in violence to the physical requirements of\r\nhuman nature, nor in contradiction to the plain sense of mankind. Man\r\nhas evils enough to contend with, and to war against, without inflicting\r\nnew and additional evils upon himself, like this most health-trying and\r\nhealth-destroying Ramadan. My turjeman confessed every body was mad in\r\nRamadan. Whatever becomes of me in the deserts of Africa, I hope I shall\r\nhave force of mind enough to maintain my religion intact.\r\n\r\nI amused myself with thinking how the Desert-travelling might be\r\nconsiderably shortened. This could be effected by joining camels with\r\nhorses through the routes. Horses could come easily from Tripoli to The\r\nMountains in two days. The camels could undertake the journey from The\r\nMountains to Seenawan in three or four days. Horses then could again\r\naccomplish the rest in two days. In all, _seven_ days. Were Europeans in\r\npossession of this country, horses and mules would soon take the place of\r\ncamels, for all quick travelling. Putting aside horses, by the use of the\r\n_maharee_, or fleet-camel, the journey for post could be reduced nearly\r\nhalf. All the Moors and Arabs dissuade me against going to Timbuctoo,\r\nassuring me that the Touaricks will cut my throat; but I begin to feel my\r\nopinion changing as to the Touaricks. I am sure, if a friend can be made\r\nof a brave man of this nation, there is no danger. Am glad, however,\r\npeople manifest some sympathy with my travelling projects; what I want to\r\ndo is, to effect some real discovery, or do something great in Africa.\r\nGhadames is not enough, nor even Bornou; it is, must be, Timbuctoo. Yet a\r\nman must not put his head into the fire and then call upon God to quench\r\nthe flames. Met Sheikh Makouran in the street, and brought him home to my\r\nhouse in order that he might give me a more detailed account of the\r\nfinances of Ghadames. Notwithstanding that the Turks overturn and ruin\r\ncommerce by restrictions, they poorly protect the merchants. The Sheikh\r\ncomplained to me of several losses. During the last two years four\r\nghafalahs had been plundered on different routes, by which he lost\r\nconsiderable sums. Other merchants lost property in proportion. He\r\nconsidered Ghadames, from various causes, fast approaching its ruin. Our\r\nconversation then turned to the New World, America. He was quite\r\nastonished at my description of it, and asked if any Mohammedans were\r\nthere. We then came to the traffic in slaves. He did not see why men\r\nshould not be sold like camels and asses, if such was the law of God.\r\n\"All,\" he observed, \"depended upon the will of the Creator of all\r\nbeings.\"\r\n\r\nThe Rais is a very religious man, and I'm cautious what I say. At noon,\r\npaid him a visit, and said, \"Why, all the people are dead to day.\" He\r\nreplied, \"It's only for one day.\" I never saw a poor devil look so\r\ncomfortless. He is an inveterate, eternal smoker, like all who boast to\r\nbe of the same nation as the Imperial Osmanlis, the pipe is never out of\r\nhis mouth; he therefore suffers more than any person in Ghadames. He was\r\nstill busy, or affected to be, to kill time, weighing gold with his\r\nservants. I said, \"Is there much gold in the country?\" \"Less and less\r\nevery year,\" was the reply. Many caravans go by way of Mourzuk, not\r\ncoming this way. The servant held up the little bags, showing that the\r\ngold, not more than two or three ounces, belonged to _four_ persons. When\r\ngold is brought over The Desert, it is tied up in little dirty filthy\r\nbits of rags, first twisted round where it opens, and then tied. These\r\nare carried on the person, in the bosom or the turban.\r\n\r\nWhen a caravan is attacked and the people rifled, all these little bags\r\nof rags, whether containing gold, or salt, pepper, essences, or what not,\r\nare scrupulously cut open by the brigands. The gold brought to Ghadames\r\nconsists chiefly of women's ear-rings, hoop and drop ear-rings. Some of\r\nthe drops are hollow and contain little matters which rattle, and\r\nperfumed with small quantities of atar, or of zebed, (civet). The\r\nworkmanship is rude and clumsy, but the gold is of the finest quality,\r\nthough small and unpolished, something as the Malta gold is worked. The\r\nRais collects the gold from those who cannot pay in the current coin. The\r\ngold country of the merchants is not very distinctly understood by them.\r\nSome say it is _fouk_, \"above,\" Timbuctoo, others beyond Jinnee and\r\nBambara, about three months from Timbuctoo, in a south-west direction.\r\nThe country is called Mellee, which includes many large districts and\r\nprovinces, but the particular district is _Furra_. This is a flat and\r\nsandy place, \"not a stone,\" say the merchants, \"is to be seen.\" The mines\r\nof Furra, if such they may be called, are sold by auction, and the lot of\r\nland is a lot of fortune, some plots producing nothing, others gold in\r\nabundance. When the gold arrives at Timbuctoo, it is converted into\r\nwomen's ornaments, mostly ear-rings. I have seen very few bags of\r\ngold-dust or bars. There are no camel-caravans from Timbuctoo to Mellee\r\nand Furra; people go in small parties on horses and asses; some go alone\r\non foot. Foot-travelling is very common in Central Africa; and these\r\npedestrian merchants or pedlars will make journeys of three and four\r\nmonths. A merchant is obliged to remain some time before he can buy up\r\nany quantity of gold; it is brought in such small quantities, and the\r\ntrade in gold is declining, and has been so for twenty years past. It is\r\nprobable the merchants take more of it now to the western coast and its\r\nEuropean factories. Certainly that route is safer than bringing it north,\r\nover several months' journey of Desert.\r\n\r\nThe Rais is a most diligent servant of Government. One cannot help\r\nobserving, however, that the whole scope and end of governing with the\r\nOsmanlis is--_money_. Of the people, their protection and improvement,\r\nthey rarely ever think. As the Rais is now busy in making every body book\r\nup, some people asked me if there was much money in Tripoli? I told them\r\nI did not think there was any money left. \"The Pasha has plenty,\" cried\r\none. I took the trouble of explaining the new system, that each\r\nfunctionary had a salary, granted by the Sultan, from the highest to the\r\nlowest, and the Deftadar, after paying each his salary, sent the rest of\r\nthe money to Constantinople, where (as the Rais himself said) it was\r\n\"poured away as water.\" Perhaps this was speaking too freely, but the\r\nMoslemites at times speak uncommonly free and bold for despotic\r\ngovernments. The Bey of Tunis has often been menaced with hell-fire by\r\nthe Arabs, when they pleaded before him in the hall of judgment,\r\nswearing, that if he did not deal to them justice, God would deal to him\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nThe use of different terms is very curious in travelling through\r\nNorth Africa, and each country has its peculiar Arabic word, the\r\nwords being all more or less classical. Perhaps no word is\r\nso much used in Ghadames and The Mountains as the epithet\r\n_batel_--‮باطل‬--\"vain, useless,\" &c., and really answers in its\r\nuse to something like our tremendous \"Humbug.\" It especially denotes\r\neverything bad, false, and wrong, in any matter and in any body. On\r\nthe contrary, for the opposite epithet, various terms are used,\r\n\"_maleah_,\" \"tayeb,\" and \"_zain_,\" which latter term always means\r\npretty, as well as good. The polite Ghadamseeah are very fond of _zain_;\r\nbut it should properly apply to pretty women. The people use the term\r\n‮شهر‬ \"month,\" for moon, instead of ‮قمر‬. The ‮ق‬ is\r\nnot distinguished in pronunciation from ‮غ‬, and I have not attempted\r\nit in writing. Indeed, I shall avoid as much as possible distinctions\r\nwhich the generality of readers cannot understand.\r\n\r\nOnly one of my patients came to-day, the little blind boy. The Rais sent\r\nme in the evening a fine dish and soup, on occasion of the night of the\r\nfirst day's fasting. The people kept to-night as an _âyed_ or feast. A\r\nTouarick took Said, my servant, aside, and whispered mysteriously in his\r\near,--\"Has the Christian fasted to-day?\" Speaking to a liberal Moor, I\r\ntold him the fast was _bătāl_, inasmuch as the Mussulmans ate all night\r\nand slept the greater portion of the day, making things equal; that to\r\nfast really, as some Christians did, was to eat nothing, night or day. At\r\nthe time I added, \"I am not such a fool as to increase the miseries of\r\nthis life by fasting when I can get anything to eat.\" The fellow,\r\nlaughing, observed, \"You English are right.\" I see the fast is nearly\r\nuniversal, old and young, rich and poor, high and low, all fast. They mix\r\nwith it strong religious feelings, and I dare say fanaticism, a quality\r\nrarely apart from the purest religious sentiment. Still continue our\r\nconversations on Timbuctoo. Most of the old respectable merchants have\r\nbeen to Timbuctoo. One of them, Haj Mansour, resided there fourteen\r\nyears, carrying on a prosperous trade. But so perverse and unstable are\r\nhuman affairs, that, on returning home after so long an exile, with\r\nthirty camels laden with the riches of the interior, and with much fine\r\ngold, and whilst within a few days of Touat, the banditti of The Desert\r\nfell upon him and carried off everything, not leaving a water-skin to\r\nquench his thirst! Had he not been near Touat, he would have perished in\r\nThe Desert. The Haj is quite black, though his features are not Negro. He\r\nis now an old gentleman of upwards of seventy, and yet very active. His\r\nfamily is immense; what with women, and girls, and sons, and grandsons,\r\nit musters some thirty souls. He told me with bitterness, as if it had\r\nbeen the case with himself, the merchants were often their own enemies,\r\nthey were so parsimonious that they would not hire a sufficient escort of\r\nTouaricks, and so left defenceless in The Desert many were plundered and\r\nruined irretrievably. The greatest misfortune in travelling through the\r\ncountry of the Touaricks is, their chiefs have not sufficient power to\r\ncontrol the people, and for whose actions they will not always be\r\nresponsible. One day you may meet with the best of men amongst the\r\nTouaricks, the next day with a band of robbers; such is the uncertainty\r\nand insecurity of The Desert.\r\n\r\n_5th._--It would be a good project at least, and might be attended with\r\nincalculable benefit, in promoting Christianity and civilization in\r\nAfrica, were portions of The Scriptures translated into Touarick, with\r\nthe native Touarick characters. Their vanity would be so exceedingly\r\nexcited that it would be almost impossible for them to refuse reading a\r\nbook written in their own dear characters. All can read their own\r\ncharacters, but very few the Arabic. It is not a little surprising, if I\r\nam to believe what I hear, that the Touaricks, with all their savage\r\nboldness--whose home is The Desert--will not venture on a journey to\r\nTripoli. Many, many times have they been persuaded and pressed by the\r\ncoast merchants, but they have always set their faces against the\r\njourney. Perhaps they think (as some, indeed, hinted to me) the Pasha\r\nwould keep them prisoners, and not let them return until they had\r\ndelivered up some of their districts to his authority. Whatever the\r\nmotive, it is strange that men, who wander through all parts of Central\r\nAfrica, cannot be prevailed upon to visit Tripoli. I have heard but of\r\none exception.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to witness the least sign of improvement in a people who\r\nare commonly condemned by their own habits, their religion, and the\r\nopinions of Europeans, to a retrograde or eternally stationary existence.\r\nI was much pleased to observe in one of the small squares of the city a\r\ntree recently planted, (the _tout_[23], a species of small white\r\nmulberry,) which promises to afford not only a grateful shade to repose\r\nunder in summer's burning heat, but is in itself a pretty ornament. The\r\ngreat fault of the Africans is want of forethought, or impatience of the\r\nfuture. Their maxim is, to enjoy the present, to take no thought for the\r\nmorrow, but let the morrow provide for itself. Like all rude and\r\nunlettered people, the precepts of religion are interpreted in their\r\nstrictest literality. To-day, I find more people in the streets, and the\r\nRamadan is not so visible in their faces as I expected it would be. The\r\nfact is, the generality of the Saharan inhabitants, and especially the\r\npoor Arabs eat but once, or make but one meal a day, and this in the\r\nevening; so, in reality, as far as eating is concerned, the Ramadan is no\r\nRamadan with them. Saw the Rais, he is better than yesterday. His\r\nExcellency called me a simpleton for talking with the Touaricks about\r\ngoing to Timbuctoo; nevertheless, I feel as if I should like to go the\r\nwhole-hog--Timbuctoo, or nothing. The future will tell! His Excellency,\r\nhowever, observed, that the Touaricks of Touat had nearly destroyed all\r\nthe banditti on the route of Timbuctoo. It is the interest of the\r\nTouaricks to keep the routes free that they may have the advantage of the\r\nvisits and escorting of caravans.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of Ghadames is that there is no Jew resident in\r\nthe city. It is strange that a people of such a commercial genius as the\r\nIsraelites should never have had courage to undertake an enterprize over\r\nThe Great Desert, whilst they have crept all around it. In Tunis they are\r\nscattered throughout the Jereed; in Algeria they are established at the\r\noases of Souf and Mezab; in Morocco we find them at Sous and Wadnoun; and\r\nin Tripoli they are located in nearly every town of the coast, whilst a\r\nfew visit The Mountains. But, to the credit of the Jews and their\r\nmercantile genius, it is not their fault. The fanaticism of the Ghadamsee\r\npeople would be strongly opposed to their residence here, more so than\r\nagainst Christians; it is enough to support the overbearing Christian\r\n_kafer_, without the pollution of the weak miserable Jew in their holy\r\ncity, for the _force_ principle makes the Mohammedans respect the\r\nChristians. The weak are despised, the strong respected. I might,\r\nhowever, have made the experiment of bringing a Jewish servant here: one\r\nsadly wanted to come with me. Still a traveller should not unnecessarily\r\nincrease his difficulties, and excite the prejudices of the people\r\namongst whom he resides, mostly by sufferance. It is probable also the\r\nmercantile jealousy of the people would be excited against the Jews.\r\nAfterwards I learnt that two _Barbary_ Jews went either to Bornou or\r\nSoudan, in the year 1844, and returned safe. Unfortunately this species\r\nof Jew can add nothing to our stock of geographical knowledge beyond what\r\nwe may get from the Arabs and Moors themselves; his ideas of nature and\r\nscience are all the same, with the exception of a few religious dogmas,\r\nand a strong national bias. The visit of these two Jews to Bornou excited\r\nno attention in Tripoli. Along the line of The Desert the Jews help\r\ncommerce. They are great ostrich-feather merchants in Southern Morocco.\r\nSome have said they go to Timbuctoo, but this report is not\r\nauthenticated. In Souf they greatly assist the Arabs in the exchange of\r\ntheir products. About twenty families are established amongst the\r\nSouāfah, in the greatest security of life and property. The Jews here\r\ndress like the Arabs, and are not easily distinguishable from them. In\r\nmost of the interior districts they have the privilege of dressing like\r\nthe rest of the people.\r\n\r\nThe Rais is an old bachelor, like myself. He seems to live very\r\nwretchedly without a wife. The good Mussulmans, who think it a sin to\r\nlive unmarried, excuse him because his residence in different parts of\r\nthe regency is uncertain, and he tells them he cannot lead about a wife.\r\nThe only object of affection of this bachelor is a parrot, which speaks\r\npure Housa lingo, and is very angry at the gruff tones of the Touraghee\r\nlanguage, always scolding the Touaricks when they speak.\r\n\r\nMy Marabout camel-driver once had an interesting conversation with me\r\nabout a plurality of wives:--\r\n\r\n\"It is not right to have more wives than one, because men and women are\r\nnearly equally in numbers, and if one man has two wives another man must\r\ngo without even one.\"\r\n\r\n_The Marabout._--\"Oh, if a man has money, he may have two, or three, or\r\nfour?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not a good religion which gives four wives to one man because he\r\nhas money, and leaves another man without any because he has no money, or\r\nnot so much money as his neighbour.\"\r\n\r\n_The Marabout._--\"So it is,\" (as if convinced of the reasonableness of\r\nthe thing).\r\n\r\n\"Why has such an old man as Sheikh Makouran two young wives? This is\r\nagainst nature.\"\r\n\r\n_The Marabout._--\"He plays; his time of work is past.\"\r\n\r\nI believe this unequal distribution of the women is a great check on\r\npopulation. It prevails to a greater extent amongst the Negro tribes. I\r\nam not of opinion that Central Africa is populous. I saw nowhere any\r\npopulous districts myself.\r\n\r\nThe wood used in the construction of buildings is that of the date-tree,\r\nwhich, apparently, grows stronger and tougher with age. Of this all the\r\ndoors of the houses and the lighter works are made. Wood for fireing is\r\nbrought in from The Sahara, but from a great distance. It is sold for\r\nthree Tunisian piastres the camel-load. It is the common brush-wood,\r\nunderwood, or scrub of The Desert, and is excessively dry, for withered\r\nand dead trees or shrubs are gathered. In seasons of rain The Sahara\r\ncreates this wood quickly, it then perishes for want of rain. Sometimes\r\nwood for building is brought from Tripoli, _i. e._, deal-boards. Our\r\ncaravan brought some doors for a mosque, made of deal.\r\n\r\nThis evening was a grand celebration of divine worship in the house of\r\nthe Rais, and a Marabout chanted verses from the Koran. His Excellency\r\ncertainly gains the respect, if not the affections, of the pious. He is\r\noften said by the people to be a man who \"fears God.\" I sat near the door\r\nlistening. A fellow said to me, \"You must sit farther off whilst the\r\npeople are praying, it is unlawful to sit where you are.\" I took no\r\nnotice of his impertinence. The Rais sent me yesterday, as the evening\r\nbefore, a very good supper. Being Ramadan, I stopped up till midnight\r\ntalking politics with him. He is a native of a province, near Circassia,\r\nfallen under the iron rule of Muskou (the Russians). Having been in the\r\nSyrian campaign he was enabled to see the _feeding_ of the English\r\nsoldiers and sailors, which quite astonished him. He observed, \"The\r\nEmperor of Russia will never have good troops, he scarcely gives them\r\nanything to eat. It is not surprising they desert to the Circassians.\"\r\nThe Rais has a great dread of the Russians absorbing the Ottoman empire:\r\nit is not an unreasonable dread.\r\n\r\n_6th._--My turjeman complains that neither he nor the people can pay\r\ntheir excessive taxes; they must all be soon ruined. Yet a couple of\r\nthousand pounds per annum is nothing for a commercial city like this. He\r\nsays, \"If we were to cultivate our gardens, we should have more; but then\r\nthe Turks would demand more, so our spirits are broken, and we are eaten\r\nup. We have no heart to work for our oppressors.\" Continue to read the\r\nArabic New Testament, which aids me in colloquial disquisitions with the\r\npeople. The Ghadamsee people persist in not taking medicines during the\r\nfast. One told me, \"Even if a man dies, and medicine could save him, he\r\nmust not take it.\" I have therefore fewer patients during the inexorable\r\nRamadan. But I _save_ my tea and coffee--\"An ill wind blows, &c.\" The\r\nRais, however, gets his tea in the evening. It is remarkable with what\r\nwillingness, and without any sort of prejudice, several of the people\r\noffer me information. Even when refused, I always find it arises from\r\nindolence to narrate it. They are not afraid that I am collecting\r\ninformation to supply the English Government with the means of invading\r\ntheir country, like some Moors in Barbary. They look upon the thing just\r\nas it is,--that I am writing a book about their country to amuse\r\nChristians.\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh of the slaves came in, with several Ghadamsee youths:--\r\n\r\n\"The Governor says, you are not the Sheikh; _he_ is the Sheikh.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, does he say?\"\r\n\r\n(_The Youths._--\"But the Sheikh _is_ the Sheikh.\")\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" says the Sheikh, \"from Timbuctoo; all the people are Mohammedans,\r\nand fast. Do you fast?\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"I eat and drink what is good at all times, even wild-boar.\"\r\n\r\n_The Sheikh and Youths._--\"Oh, wonderful!\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"You write Arabic?\"\r\n\r\nI wrote that God was _one_.\r\n\r\n_They._--\"And write Mahomet was the Prophet of God?\"\r\n\r\nI wrote Mahomet was the Prophet of the Arabs and the Touaricks?\r\n\r\n_The Sheikh._--\"Ah, ah, I see, I see, you're very cunning.\"\r\n\r\n_The Youths._--\"Who is your Prophet?\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Aysa (Jesus).\"\r\n\r\n_The Youths._--\"Have you any books of your Prophet?\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Yes, here is one:\" (Giving them the New Testament.)\r\n\r\n_They._--\"Oh, see, let us read it, let us take it home.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"No; if you were men, yes. But if I allow you to read it, or read\r\nit to you, your Bey and the people will be offended with me, and send me\r\nout of the city. When you go to Tripoli, you can see and read the\r\nChristian books.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised that a well-informed man like the Sheikh Makouran should\r\nask me whether the Emperor of Morocco was also Emperor of Fez, and\r\nwhether Morocco was a large country. \"Ghat,\" says the Rais, \"like all the\r\nTouarick countries, is a republic. All the people govern.\" Walked out\r\nthis evening for the first time to-day. The people are vehement in their\r\ncomplaints against the oppressions of the Turks: \"All the wealth of the\r\ncountry is dried up, and the merchants are all running away. We are\r\nruined unless the English save us.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been very hot and sultry to-day. Not a breath of air. The sky\r\novercast--a profound, deathlike tranquillity sleeping over the environs!\r\nThe Rais sent supper as usual. After visiting him, he had a fit of\r\nwriting, and wrote for the courier all night. Thank God, there are no\r\ngnats in Ghadames. I have not seen nor felt any. It is probably owing to\r\nthe absence of no water, stagnating here, all being absorbed in the dry\r\nearth of the gardens.\r\n\r\n_7th._--Read eight chapters of the Arabic Testament. Some of the phrases\r\nvery strangely rendered into Arabic. The Moors cannot understand them. My\r\nTestament wants some verses: it is the ordinary Arabic Bible circulated\r\nby The Bible Society. There is no good translation of The Scriptures into\r\nArabic, from what I have been able to learn. Continue to think all day\r\nlong and dream of Timbuctoo. Had a conversation with the Touaricks about\r\na journey there. The difficulty is, the strongest Touarick escort\r\npracticable cannot always pass through the Touarick districts, there\r\nbeing such a great variety of tribes. It is the quarrels of the Touaricks\r\nthemselves, and not our not being able to trust them individually, which\r\nrenders the route so dangerous.\r\n\r\nSlave-dealing is so completely engendered in the minds of the Ghadamsee\r\nmerchants, that they cannot conceive how it can be wrong. A young man\r\nwrote me down the objects (very few) of exportation from Soudan, and in\r\nthe following order, viz., \"Cottons, elephants' teeth, _bekhour_\r\n(perfume), wax, slaves, bullocks' skins, red skins, feathers, (of the\r\nostrich).\" Human beings are just summed up with the rest as an article of\r\ncommerce, as a matter of course, in the most mercantile style.\r\n\r\nIt will be next to impossible to propagate anti-slavery notions in\r\nCentral Africa, supported as slavery is by commerce and religion. We can\r\nonly say, \"With God nothing is impossible.\"\r\n\r\nAll the people bring their griefs and malcontentments to me. It's not so\r\npleasant to be bored by them, let alone the policy of my listening to all\r\nthey have to say. But the ill humour of these poor fleeced people must\r\nhave a vent, or _sfogo_, as the Italians term it, and what can I do? An\r\nintelligent merchant came to me. \"Yâkob, _bisslamah_, (how do you fare?)\r\nThe Rais is always collecting money, don't you see? That's the business\r\nof the Turks. This city is 4000 years of age. It flourished before\r\nPharaoh, in the time of Nimrod. Now the Turks come to destroy it; their\r\nbusiness is to destroy; such is the will of God.\" I might elaborate the\r\nidea. The genius of the Turks is to destroy. The hand of the Turk blasts\r\nas mildew everything it touches; it has destroyed the fairest portions of\r\nthe earth. Happily, however, it so destroys itself, for it is not\r\ndesirable for truth and civilization that the sway of the Osmanlis should\r\nbe restored to its pristine strength.\r\n\r\nAmong the most friendly people to me in Ghadames are the Arab soldiers.\r\nNow, whilst I write, not less than twenty of these poor fellows are lying\r\naround my door, and in the _skeefah_ (entrance-passage or room) of my\r\nhouse. They tell me always, my house is their house, and their mountains\r\nmy mountains. They all speak in the highest terms of Mr. Frederick\r\nWarrington, son of Colonel Warrington, whom they call _Fredreek_. They\r\nconsider him as one of themselves, and so he is as to habits, manners,\r\nand language, and frequently dress. When they quarrel in Tripoli, the\r\nultima ratio, or dernier ressort, is not to go to the Pasha, but _Nimshee\r\nlel Fredreek_, \"Let us go to Frederick!\" This is \"the settler.\" It has\r\noften been said amongst the Consular corps of Tripoli, that, in case\r\nGreat Britain thought it expedient to assume the Protectorate of Tripoli,\r\nFrederick Warrington would be their man, the instrument of revolution.\r\nThere is not a single Arab in the Regency but what would flock to his\r\nstandard. He has been all his lifetime in Tripoli.\r\n\r\nM. Carette, in his brochure of the _Commerce of Central Africa_, says,\r\n\"Timbaktou, Kânou, et Noufi sont les trois marchés principaux du pays des\r\nNoirs. Les voyageurs du Nord ne parlent pas du Niger; c'est une limite\r\nqu'ils ne franchissent pas; ils paraissent n'avoir aucunes relations avec\r\nles populations Mandingues de la rive droite:\" (p. 26). This is inexact.\r\nThe merchants do speak of the Niger frequently to me, calling it the\r\n_Wady Neel_, thinking, and which is a very ancient opinion, that it is a\r\ncontinuation of the Nile of Egypt. They also visit the opposite shores or\r\nbanks of the Mandingoes. Some of them go to Noufi, as M. Carette admits;\r\non my leaving for Ghat, a merchant going to Noufi was my fellow\r\ntraveller, and promised to accompany me there. Here Mr. Becroft has\r\nrecently, from the south-east, ascending the Niger, shaken hands with the\r\nmerchants of the north. An old slave, a native of _Sansandee_ (or\r\n_Sinsindee_ ‮سنسندي‬) says of the Niger, \"The river is like\r\nthe sea of Tripoli and all sweet\" (water.)\r\n\r\nThe Sheikh Makouran does not approve of my Timbuctoo ideas. Says the city\r\nis always in an uproar with the Touaricks, who are robbers and not like\r\nthe Touaricks of Touat. Walked through the town at noon, and met\r\nEssnousee, had not seen him for some time, and wondered what had become\r\nof him. He was very friendly, and wanted to bring me lemonade in the\r\nstreet. But as there was a large concourse of people present, all\r\nfasting, poor devils, at this time of the day; I thought common decency\r\nrequired me to go with him to his house. I waited in a dark corner close\r\nby his door, and here I quaffed the forbidden draught in the high-noon of\r\nthe Fast. He smiled at me when I finished, and said, \"Well done, Yâkob.\"\r\nHe gave me also a fine melon to bring home with me. I considered this\r\nfeat of drinking lemonade, under the circumstance related, a remarkable\r\ntrait of tolerance. People usually put into their lemonade pieces of rag\r\nsteeped in lemon-juice and dried; in this way the juice is preserved from\r\nevaporation. Essnousee had just lost his wife. \"Have you any other\r\nwives?\" I said. \"Oh yes,\" he replied, \"one here and one in Ghat.\" Many of\r\nthe merchants, like the roving tar who has a sweetheart at every port,\r\nhave a wife at every city of The Desert and Soudan where they trade.\r\nSeveral of the children now in Ghadames were born either in Timbuctoo or\r\nSoudan.\r\n\r\n_8th._--Few patients on account of the Ramadan. Weather extremely sultry.\r\nPeople bear the fast remarkably well, and with good humour enough. The\r\nRais persists in sending me supper though I would rather he did not.\r\nAfter mass and chanting prayers in the evening, his Excellency holds a\r\ncourt. He abused the Sultan of Constantinople and called him an ass for\r\nspending his money like a fool, and this license before all the people!\r\nSmoking, drinking coffee, talking, and writing for the courier, all\r\ntogether, so his Excellency passes his Ramadan evenings. Said, my negro\r\nservant, is becoming as great a man as his master in Ghadames. He\r\nreceives visits from all the slaves of the city, as well as the free\r\nnegroes. Being slaves, I am very indulgent, and sometimes they stop all\r\nday with him. The slaves of the Touaricks also come. Said manages to talk\r\nwith them all in all languages. I see there is a sort of free-masonry\r\namongst negroes, and they all (which is greatly to their credit) stick\r\nclose to one another, and take one another's part. Said is impatient\r\nabout his _âtka_, or freedom ticket. He said to me to-day--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Sidi, where's my âtka? The people will steal me and sell me again.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Said,\" I replied, \"have patience, if they steal you, they must steal\r\nme also.\"\r\n\r\nVisited with Said to-day \"the Street of Slaves.\" This is a little dark\r\nstreet appropriated for the rendezvous of the slaves in my part of the\r\ncity, where they enjoy the cool of the evening and chat together. I\r\nsquatted down to chat amongst them, which awakened their curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"Who's that naked boy there?\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"The Touaricks brought him from Bornou.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they going to do with him?\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"The Touaricks will send him to Tripoli, and sell him; will you\r\nbuy him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; if I buy him, my sultan will put me in prison.\"\r\n\r\n(_They_, one to the other.--\"Do you believe him?\")\r\n\r\n\"The English had many slaves, but gave them all the _âtka_; and soon,\r\nplease God, they will destroy slavery in all the world.\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"Ah, ah,\" (laughing), \"that's right; we wish to have the\r\n_âtka_.\"\r\n\r\nI found some were from Soudan, others from Timbuctoo, the greater part\r\nfrom Bornou. About a score of them were present; their greatest delight\r\nwas in exchanging their various lingos. When they heard I was going to\r\nKanou, one jumped up like a fury, saying, \"Oh, I must send something to\r\nmy mother.\" This was a poor grey-headed wrinkled-faced old man! His poor\r\nmother, alas! may have been long ago whipped to death upon the cotton\r\nplantations of South Carolina, where the blood of the slave is poured out\r\nto fertilize the fields of pampered republicans, and give tongue to the\r\nbraggadocio of the free sons of the Model-Republic!\r\n\r\nTo-day, saw three swallows in a garden for the first time at Ghadames.\r\nThey darted over the heads and through the foliage of the graceful palms,\r\nperforming sweet eccentric circles. To me, they were winged messengers\r\nfrom the fair bowers and silvery brooks of Paradise.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the general ignorance of the Ghadamsee people on\r\nEuropean geography, I have only to record a part of a conversation with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_They._--\"Where's your country; is it near Rome?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; further to the west and north.\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"Did not the English spring from the Arabs?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the English are from the north, a colder country; the Arabs are from\r\na hot country.\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"Are the Greeks like the English? and is their country near\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; they are farther from us than Rome itself.\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"Do the English fast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes; but when they fast they don't eat in the night time, like\r\nyou; they fast day and night.\"\r\n\r\n_They._--\"That's not good; that's not right. Do you fast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, thank God.\"\r\n\r\nThe people bother my life out about fasting. Two young Touarick women\r\ncame to me--\r\n\r\n\"Thou Christian! dost thou fast?\" (they having never seen a person before\r\nwho did not fast).\r\n\r\n\"No; the Christians don't fast.\"\r\n\r\n_The girls._--\"Don't the Christians know God?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they know God.\"\r\n\r\n_The girls._--\"No, they don't, for they don't say Mahomet is the prophet\r\nof God.\"\r\n\r\nThe sum of religion amongst many of the wild tribes, is the formula of\r\nMahomet being the prophet of God--fasting and circumcision. Many of the\r\nTouaricks, however, will not fast, or fast with difficulty, it involving\r\nthe cessation of smoking, of which they are passionately fond. A\r\nTouarick, who was accustomed to visit Mr. Gagliuffi at Mourzuk, ridiculed\r\nthe Ramadan, and called those who fasted, fools. He would squat down in\r\nMr. Gagliuffi's house, and take out his pipe at midday, and say, \"Come,\r\nConsul, let's have a _drink_ of the pipe. These people who fast all day\r\nare asses.\" Other Touaricks, more scrupulous, always set out on a journey\r\nduring Ramadan, in order to have the relaxation permitted by the law.\r\n\r\nThe Rais is deeply engaged in petty finance, some quite mites, to make up\r\nthe accounts for Tripoli. Whilst seated near his Excellency, a big lout\r\nof a fellow was brought up, charged with beating a little urchin, who\r\nwas present to substantiate the charge. The Rais, after gravely hearing\r\nthe case, had the big clown turned round with his hands tied behind him,\r\nand then told the little rogue aggrieved to lay it into him as hard as he\r\ncould with his fists clenched. The little imp, who looked as wicked as\r\nimp could be, instantly gave the broad back of the great fellow half a\r\ndozen strokes. Hereupon all the bystanders, and the officers of his\r\nExcellency, burst into a fit of tremendous laughter, and the big coward\r\nwas allowed to escape, sneaking off like a dog with his tail between his\r\nlegs. The Rais came up to me smiling with great self-complacency, and\r\nsaid--\"Well, isn't that the way to administer justice?\" I then astonished\r\nthe hangers-on of his Excellency's Court, by relating to them some\r\naccount of the expeditions to the North Pole. They asked me whether any\r\nMussulmans were there, and how they could fast when the sun did not set?\r\nSeveral said I merely invented the account to amuse them. In this case,\r\nand also in that of the precepts of the Mosaic Institute, we see the\r\ninconvenience of making the precepts of religion depend on local and\r\nphysical circumstances.\r\n\r\nI have seen little urchins in Italy, before the flaming wax-light altars,\r\ndrink in with their mother's milk the virus of Popery, but I never\r\nwitnessed a stronger case of infantile prejudice than to-day. A child of\r\nless than three years old came running out of a by-street (apparently no\r\nperson being near it), and called after me, _Kafer, kafer_, \"Infidel,\r\ninfidel\"! and spat at me in the bargain like a little toad.\r\n\r\nNoon.--I met with a fellow, a sort of swaggering cheap-jack\r\npenny-a-liner, who swore that there was no man so learned as himself in\r\nall Ghadames, and that he would teach me the history of Ghadames, and all\r\nthe world, _for money_. He then followed me home, asked me for my\r\njournal, and wrote in it five lines of Arabic poetry. Meanwhile I poured\r\nhim out a cup of tea, putting a large lump of sugar in it. When he had\r\nfinished his five lines, which he did without being asked, he impudently\r\ndemanded a dollar for his trouble. I told some Arabs who were present to\r\nturn him out of the house. He decamped, but not before giving us his\r\nblessing--\"The curse of God be upon you Arab dogs, and the Christian\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\nAwfully hot to-day. The hottest day since my residence in Ghadames. Yet,\r\nstrange to say, when shut up in my room, I feel very little of it. My\r\nhouse is only one story high; there is only a single roof between me and\r\nthis sun of fire--a strong proof of how little is necessary to protect\r\nyou from the heats of The Sahara. Late at night, when sitting with the\r\nRais, he amused me with pulling off his greegrees or talismans. As he\r\npulled off each he kissed it devoutly, and laid it by gently on his\r\npapers. He wears one round his arm in the shape of an armlet, and three\r\nround his neck, two suspended with separate ribbons, and one with a\r\nsilver chain. As he kissed each, he put it to his eyes, rubbing it over\r\nthe eyelid. I am sadly afraid his charms obtain all the credit of my\r\nsolution of nitrate of silver. Be it so; it is hard to cure men of this\r\nsort of folly, at best a most unwished, unrequited labour[24]. I always\r\ntell the Ghadamsee people the medicine I distribute neither belongs to\r\nme, nor to the English Consul at Tripoli, but to the Queen of England,\r\nand which, I have observed, heightens its value in their eyes. _Douwa\r\nmin, ând Sultana Ingleeza_, (\"physic from the English Sultana\",) is a\r\nsort of royal talisman which helps the medicine down as a bit of sugar\r\ntaken with a child's draught.\r\n\r\n_10th._--The women brought several little children, all ailing, but could\r\ndo very little for them. Occupied writing most of the day. Spent the\r\nevening with the Rais. His Excellency is very fond of politics: \"The\r\nTouaricks number more than two hundred thousand souls. They are dispersed\r\nover all The Desert. The Sahara is not so difficult to occupy as some\r\nthink; it can be more easily conquered than the mountainous districts.\r\nThe country is more open. The only difficulty is the wells. But in\r\nwinter, the time when military expeditions are undertaken, there is water\r\non the line of most of the grand routes, and camels can supply a large\r\nbody of compact troops, where there are no wells. At the different wells\r\nsmall forts could be built, like that I am building at _Emjezzem_, which\r\nforts the Touaricks would never dare approach. The wells once in\r\npossession of the invading force, it would be impossible for any\r\nconsiderable body of Arabs or Touaricks to follow up or after their\r\nsteps. Twenty thousand men could occupy, in detachments, the greater part\r\nof The Sahara. The French will go to Touat one day, not yet!\" But the\r\nRais never spoke much against the French. He often said, \"I wish the\r\nFrench would exterminate the _Shânbah_ banditti, the Sultan would applaud\r\nthem for it. I pray God the French will destroy these robbers.\"\r\n\r\nContinue to agitate the question of a tour farther into the interior.\r\nHave almost determined to pursue the route of Ghat, and accompany the\r\nghafalah of the Ghadamsee merchants. This route has two advantages for\r\nme--I shall be safe with my old friends the merchants, and the route has\r\nnever before been trodden by an European traveller. The routes of Bornou\r\nand Timbuctoo have been travelled by Europeans, though some of the\r\nparties have never returned. One thing is certain--unless I go to the\r\nfirst-hand traffickers in human flesh--to the heart of Africa itself, I\r\ncan never get the information which I require. Am told I can defray the\r\nexpense of the whole journey from here to Kanou and back, (exclusive of\r\npresents), for about fifty pounds sterling, but it must be with economy.\r\nAfterwards saw several merchants again on the question, felt discouraged,\r\nand my faith shook in the Ghat route. They think the best route for me\r\nBornou, thence I may proceed to Kanou, and perhaps even to Timbuctoo. It\r\nis astonishing how everybody's opinion varies; the majority,\r\nnevertheless, are in favour of the Bornou route for me. Probably they are\r\nafraid of the responsibility of escorting me through the Touarick\r\ndistricts. Determined a day or two after to go to Kanou _viâ_ Ghat and\r\nAheer. Cannot see any danger if I stick close to the Ghadamsee merchants.\r\nA young merchant said to me, \"Yâcob, we are not jealous of you, for you\r\nare not a merchant. You can draw your money, and get it ready. The\r\nghafalah will be cheap for you, for no escort will be required. You can\r\ngo without your Consul, or the Pasha, or the Rais.\"\r\n\r\nThe wind continues hot to-day; the _ghiblee_ is getting more suffocating\r\nand intense. Everything is drooping and the poor emaciated fasters are\r\ndying with thirst. The air is as the small still breath of the furnace\r\nwhen its heat is at the greatest intensity, without flame or smoke.\r\n\r\n_11th._--Every day, in spite of the Ramadan, brings an increase of\r\npatients. In time there will not be a single inhabitant of Ghadames who\r\nhas not been physicked by my quackery. I notice my negro servant Said is\r\ngradually expanding into a full-blown reputation, of which he is very\r\nproud. The Mussulmans pay him almost more deference than myself, and I\r\nought to be jealous. It is the plan in these countries to influence the\r\nmasters through the servants; so whenever anything is to be obtained, the\r\nmasters are not spoken to, but the servants, which latter are feed and\r\nbribed until the object is obtained. Preached anti-slavery and\r\nanti-Ramadan doctrines to Berka, the liberated slave of Sheikh Makouran.\r\nThe poor fellow confessed it was better to eat and drink in the Ramadan,\r\nand not steal men and sell them as slaves, than to fast in the Ramadan,\r\nand steal men and sell them. The old lad has great influence amongst the\r\nslaves of Ghadames, being their senior, and the liberated slave of one of\r\nthe most respectable men of the country. He went and preached in turn to\r\nthe slaves my anti-slavery and anti-fast principles.\r\n\r\nIt may be observed here, that information can only be obtained bit by\r\nbit, here a little and there a little; and it is absolutely necessary to\r\nnote everything down immediately if you would not forget it, at least if\r\nyou would be correct. The Moors and Arabs have no patience, beyond a few\r\nminutes, in giving information, unless it be something where their own\r\ninterests are deeply concerned. My scattered notes must then be compared\r\none with another to arrive at a proper idea of the objects respecting\r\nwhich they treat. Some notes will necessarily correct others.\r\n\r\nA Touarick came in whilst I was eating my dinner this evening, about half\r\nan hour before sun-set. I was sitting in the patio, or open court of my\r\nhouse. The Touarick, standing erect before me, with a long spear in his\r\nright hand, and extending his left towards the sky, looked up, and then,\r\nwith an air of imposing solemnity, uttered these words in a measured,\r\nsolemn tone: \"And--thou--Christian--thou fastest--thus! Thy\r\nfather--knoweth--not--God! Thou art a _Kafer_--he is a Kafer--and the\r\nfire[25] at last will eat you both up!\" Turning round, and looking up to\r\nthis prophet-like denunciator, I said, smiling: \"Why, how now? you\r\nMussulmans fast, and think you are righteous; but whether is it better to\r\neat and drink on the Ramadan, for which God cares nothing, or fast in the\r\nRamadan, and go afterwards and steal or buy men and women and little\r\nchildren, like your little son there, and take them to Tripoli, and sell\r\nthem like donkeys and camels? This is forbidden to us English--this is\r\nour religion, not to steal and sell men, but to eat and drink in the\r\nRamadan is not forbidden to us.\" After this answer, which I had some\r\ndifficulty in making him comprehend, the fellow stood speechless,\r\ncompletely staggered. I continued to eat my dinner with a good appetite,\r\nnotwithstanding his threatening position and silence. God knows what was\r\npassing through his mind. After a long pause he receded back a few steps,\r\nand then quietly squatted down. He then got up again, and said, \"Have you\r\nany medicines for my mother in Ghat?\" I told him to come to-morrow, and I\r\nwould give him some.\r\n\r\nRais occupied as usual this morning with collecting money. He avows with\r\nexasperation that the people have deposited all their money in the hands\r\nof a few merchants of Tripoli, who are under the protection of the\r\nConsuls. He was writing teskeras to obtain money from those Tripoli\r\nmerchants. \"The Pasha,\" he added, \"gets no benefit from these deposits,\r\nnor the people. The Tripoli merchants are lying, bloodsucking Jews.\" Did\r\nnot go out again till the evening; occupied in copying a long letter for\r\n_The Times_. My sugar and tea go very fast. Do not know what I should\r\nhave done unless the Ramadan had interposed to save these luxuries of The\r\nDesert. It is surprising how rigid the fast is kept. Not a soul in the\r\ncity of the proper age who does not fast.\r\n\r\n_12th._--Weather continues very sultry. The wind has scarcely changed for\r\na month, always south. To-day I ate camel's flesh for the first time, but\r\ndid not like it much; it depends, however, upon the part you eat, as also\r\nupon the camel itself, whether young or old, or in a good condition. The\r\ncamel is usually killed when past work, and very lean and poor. The\r\npeople call camels' flesh their beef; it does serve as a substitute for\r\nbullocks' flesh, no bullocks being killed here. The whole carcase was\r\nimmediately sold as soon as exposed in the Souk.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Wrote this evening to the Governor of Ghat, to tell him I wished\r\nto come to Ghat, and begged for his protection; and that I should be\r\nobliged if he could send some trusty person to fetch me, whose expenses I\r\nwould pay. Wrote also letters to go by courier to Tripoli.\r\n\r\n_14th._--Weather continues hot. My taleb calls the season _khareef_,\r\n\"autumn;\" and says the fruits of heaven which are always ripe have\r\nnevertheless a peculiar ripeness at this period. Staring at him, he\r\ncontinued, \"Yes, there is a greater correspondence between earth and\r\nheaven than people think.\" I was recommended this taleb by the Rais. He\r\nwrites my Arabic letters for The Desert; he calls himself Mohammed Ben\r\nMousa Bel Kasem. The reader will hear now a great deal about him, and his\r\nlearning and character. He takes up my Arabic Bible now and then, and\r\nreads a verse or two; but it is astonishing how little effect, even in\r\nthe way of curiosity, it produces on the mind of these Mussulmans. One\r\nwould think at least they would like to know something of its contents.\r\nNotwithstanding, The Book, which contains the religion of the civilized\r\nworld, hardly excites curiosity enough in them to take it up and read a\r\nsingle verse! I have often offered it to them to read, but they have\r\nrefused to open the book. A great disadvantage is the crabbed, miserable\r\nlanguage into which it is translated. After the bold, impudent, and\r\nsublime language of the Koran, they cannot relish the tame and stunted\r\nlanguage of the Arabic New Testament. As for the simple and grand truths\r\nof the New Testament, these they cannot or will not comprehend. Force,\r\nor the Sword--as the Might of the Almighty--is the thing alone which\r\nstrikes the minds of Mussulmans, in spite of all their moral maxims and\r\nphilosophy. But I must confess I never expected that a religion like that\r\nof the Koran, which contains so few fundamental truths, and so few\r\nmysteries, would have produced such a race of superstitious pharisees.\r\nTo-day a fellow, whose eyes are dreadfully inflamed with ophthalmia,\r\nrefuses to have them _doctored_, because the solution administered to the\r\neye may enter the stomach, by which he would violate the sanctity of the\r\nRamadan. I can only beg him to come at night. Another jackanapes, who\r\nsuffers equally, refuses to have my solution at all applied. He said to\r\nme, \"I suffer, and I may be blind, but it will be the will of God.\" I\r\nwonder the whole population is not blind. Another sufferer craved a\r\ntalisman to drink with water at night[26].\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _Tut_, \"Morus alba,\" L. It is pleasant and sweet, but a\r\n    little insipid eating.\r\n\r\n[24] Whether the Rais brought his superstitious reverence for\r\n    amulets from Turkey or not I cannot tell, or acquired the notion\r\n    here. But the superstition seems merely to have changed place with\r\n    the Fetisch amongst the Negro Mohammedan converts. Haj Ibrahim, a\r\n    merchant of Tripoli, was the only Mussulman I found who despised\r\n    the use of charms. He observed:--\"The _grigri_ is only fit for\r\n    slaves, or ignorant Mussulmans.\"\r\n\r\n[25] Hell is ordinarily denominated _fire_ by people in The\r\n    Desert.\r\n\r\n[26] Caillié gives an affecting account of this superstition\r\n    amongst the Mandingoes:--\r\n\r\n    \"On the 8th, I found myself very ill in consequence of the food,\r\n    and I had an attack of fever. I took a few doses of sulphate of\r\n    quinine, which had the effect of abating the fever for a few days.\r\n    My host seemed much concerned at my indisposition. He searched\r\n    through some old books which contained verses of the Koran, and\r\n    brought me a scrap of paper well fumigated on which was written a\r\n    charm in Arabic characters, assuring me that it was an excellent\r\n    remedy for the disorder under which I was suffering. He directed\r\n    me to copy it on a little piece of wood which he brought me; then,\r\n    to wash off the writing with some water which I was to drink: he\r\n    observed that this would to a certainty relieve me. To please him\r\n    I copied the writing as he directed, and when he was gone washed\r\n    the bit of board; but instead of drinking the water I threw it\r\n    away, which had quite as good an effect, for next day I found\r\n    myself tolerably well. My host, of course, attributed my amendment\r\n    to the efficacy of his remedy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE FAST OF THE RAMADAN.\r\n\r\n     The Sahara, and derivation of the Name.--Astonishment of the\r\n     People at the Sovereign of England being a Woman.--Decision of\r\n     the Kady on a diseased Camel.--The old Mendicant\r\n     Bandit.--Phrenological examination of the Servants of the\r\n     Rais.--The Scorpion and the Chamelion.--Starving state of the\r\n     Arab Troops.--Contradictions in the Moorish\r\n     Character.--Difficulty of acquiring notions of Quantities and\r\n     Distances from the People.--The Princes to whom Presents are made\r\n     in the Soudan Route.--How Butchers cut up their Meat.--Connexion\r\n     between North Africa, The Sahara, and the East.--The Prophecy of\r\n     The Dajal and Gog and Magog.--Origin of the Turks, Touaricks, and\r\n     Russians.--How the Fast is broken in the Evening.--Phenomenon of\r\n     Desert Sound.--The Great Spring of Ghadames.--The Malta\r\n     Times.--The People their own Enslavers.--Quotation from\r\n     Scripture.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALEB tells me that _The Sahara_ is so called from its consisting\r\nmostly of rocky stony ground, and its name is a cognate term with\r\n_Sakharah_, ‮صخرة‬, _i. e._ \"rock.\" This derivation we can scarcely\r\nadmit, although as we advance into The Sahara we shall find at least\r\na third of its entire surface to consist of rocks and stones, and\r\nmountains. _The Sahara_--‮الصحرا‬--being the theatre of my\r\nadventures and researches, deserves a little consideration as to the\r\nderivation of this appellation, for so vast a proportion of the\r\nAfrican Continent. A late French writer, M. Le Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nDaumas, defines The Sahara as \"une contrée plate et très-vaste, où\r\nil n'y a que peu d'habitants, et dont la plus grande partie est\r\nimproductive et sablonneuse.\" This definition presents no proper\r\nidea of The Sahara. We have already seen it intersected with long\r\nlow ridges of mountains, but we shall soon meet with groups of high\r\nmountains, as well as find it bristled over and bounded by\r\ninterminable chains. We shall find also that but a certain portion\r\nof its actual mass consists of sand. Unproductive the greater part\r\nundoubtedly is, or rather uncultivated; and its population, compared\r\nwith its vast sterile surface, is extremely small, perhaps not one\r\ninhabitant to many thousand square miles. The Mahometan talebs give\r\nthe following curious etymology of the term Sahara. \"We call\r\n_Sehaur_,\" they say, \"that point scarcely distinguishable which\r\nprecedes the point of day, (_fidger_), and during which, in the time\r\nof Ramadan, we can eat, drink, and smoke. The most rigorous\r\nabstinence ought to commence from the time of morning, or when we\r\ncan distinguish a white thread from a black thread. The _Sehaur_ is\r\nthen a shade between night and the point of day, which is important\r\nfor us to seize upon and to determine, and which ought to occupy the\r\nattention of our Marabouts. One of them, Ben-ej-Jiramy, starting on\r\nthe principle, that the _Sehaur_ is more easily and sooner\r\ndistinguished by the inhabitants of the plains, where nothing bounds\r\nthe horizon, than by the mountaineers, who are enveloped in masses\r\nof earth, concludes that, from the name of the phenomenon there\r\nformed, viz., on the plains, where it is more particularly\r\ndistinguished or observed, we have named the country _Sahara_, or\r\nthe country of the _Sehaur_.\" In this whimsical and ingenious\r\nderivation there is a change of the ‮س‬ into ‮ص‬, but which is\r\nsufficiently frequent in the Shemitic languages. The grand fallacy\r\nof the above etymology is, that it assumes the Sahara to be a\r\nperfectly flat country, or country of plains, which is not the fact.\r\nThe talebs also give various names to different portions of The\r\nSahara, according to the geological character of the country.\r\n_Feeafee_ is The Oasis, where life is retired, and one spends one's\r\nhappy days amidst eternal springs of living water, reclining under\r\npalms and fruit trees, securely sheltered from the burning simoon\r\n(_shoub_). _Keefar_, is the sandy arid plain, which, occasionally\r\nwatered by the winter's revivifying refreshing and fructifying\r\nrains, produces spring herbage, where the Nomade tribes pasture\r\ntheir flocks in the neighbourhood of the oases. _Falat_, is the\r\nregion of sands in the immensity of steril wastes. But all these\r\ndistinctions are arbitrary, and can be predicated of tracts of\r\ncountry lying on the North Coast of Africa, as well as the boundless\r\nSahara. On the coast of Tripoli we have the oasis, the arid plain,\r\nand the groups of sand-hills of eternal sterility. Captain Lyon\r\nenumerates in the same way as the talebs, the various names which\r\nthe Arabs apply to different regions of The Desert. _Sahara_ is sand\r\nalone, forming a plane surface, which agrees with the hypothesis of\r\nBen-ej-Jiramy. _Ghoud_ is groups of sand-hills of indefinite height,\r\nsituate on the borders of stony plains, where the wind has formed\r\nand collected them. _Sereer_, is generally plains, whence the\r\nsand-hills have been swept, and where alone sand-hills are found.\r\n_Wâr_, is a rough plain, covered with large detached stones, lying\r\nin confusion, and very _difficult_ to pass over, which is the\r\nmeaning of the appellation. It is applied to all difficult traverse.\r\n_Hateea_, is a spot possessing the power of fertility; indeed, those\r\npatches of land which are the germs of the oases, now producing\r\nsmall stinted shrubs scattered at intervals, from which camels\r\nbrowse a scanty meal, or travellers make their Desert fire.\r\n_Wishek_, is productive sand-hills and plains, where the wild palm\r\nand lethel-tree grow. _Ghabah_, distinguishes cultivated Sahara,\r\nsometimes a portion of the oases, but mostly where there are no\r\ninhabitants. So near Touat, there is a cultivated place called\r\nGhabah, and without inhabitants. But the people of Ghadames call\r\nalso their gardens Ghabah. Sibhah, is the usual name for all salt\r\nplains, sometimes called _Shot_ in Algeria, being mostly sandy salt\r\nmarshes. Like the Sibhah of Emjessen, and \"The Lake of Marks,\" in\r\nTunis, the saline particles are often combined with earths or sand\r\nso closely as to form a substance resembling stone, and equally hard\r\nto break or cut through. With this _salt_ stone houses are built.\r\n_Wady_, is the designation of all long deep depressions of the\r\nsurface, and is used indifferently for a valley, a bed of a river,\r\nor torrent, or ravine. These wadys are almost always dry, except one\r\nor two months in the winter. _Gibel_, is applied to all hills and\r\nmountains. It is quite evident, from the above enumeration, that\r\nthese various terms can be equally applied to the coast and other\r\nregions of land, not comprehended within the assigned limits of The\r\nSahara, and are therefore not peculiar to The Great Desert of\r\nSahara.\r\n\r\nAll the people are astonished when I tell them the British Sovereign is a\r\nlady. They have enough to believe it; indeed, some of them do not, and\r\nthink I am trifling with their credulity. It goes against the grain, and\r\ntheir grain especially, to be ruled over by a woman, (though many of\r\nthem, from my own personal knowledge, are entirely under the influence of\r\ntheir wives _in private_, as all or most men are,) and is contrary to\r\nall their notions of government and womankind. I was surrounded with a\r\ngroup when the information was given, and I shall just mention the\r\nquestions which were put to me in rapid succession. \"Does that woman\r\n_govern well_?\" \"Has she a husband? What does her husband?\" \"Has she any\r\nchildren?\" \"Is she a big woman?\" \"Is she beautiful?\" \"How much does she\r\npay you for coming to our country?\" \"Who has more power, she or the\r\nSultan (of Constantinople)?\" \"What's her name?\" \"Have the Christians any\r\nother women who govern?\" And so forth. I explained to them that Spain and\r\nPortugal were ruled by two other Queens, but that, in France, a Queen\r\nnever reigns. At the mention of this latter fact, there was general\r\nmurmur of approbation, \"El-Francees ândhom _âkel_ (the French have\r\nwisdom).\" To soften the matter down a little, and abate their prejudices,\r\nI told them the father of the Queen of England had no sons, and in all\r\nsuch cases, if there were daughters, these were allowed to govern the\r\npeople. \"Batel (stupid),\" said one fellow, and the conversation dropped.\r\n\r\nBegin to like the place, as I find I can pick up information respecting\r\nthe interior. The merchants seem now more disposed to assume the\r\nresponsibility of taking me with them. Went through the market-place, and\r\nwitnessed a sitting of judgment upon a sick camel. This was an affair of\r\nthe Kady, a little, fat, chubby, cherub-looking fellow, but proud and\r\nsilent. The people said he was _sagheer_, \"young,\" and excused his\r\nuncanonical conduct. He sat, high placed on a stone-bench, amidst a\r\nsemicircle of people, squatting on the ground. He looked very grave, now\r\nexchanging a word or half syllable with one, now with another, but\r\ncontinually moving his lips as if in prayer. I met him afterwards in the\r\nstreet, and always found him moving the lips, with his rosary of black\r\nMecca beads in his hands. He holds a separate and independent\r\njurisdiction from the Rais, and is the Archbishop or Pope of Ghadames.\r\nHis decision cannot be annulled by the authorities in Tripoli, but must\r\nbe referred to the Ulemas at Constantinople. He therefore thinks not a\r\nlittle of himself, and with reason. Four questions were now before the\r\nKady, embracing physic, law, and divinity.\r\n\r\n1st. To whom did the camel belong (for the Arabs disputed this)?\r\n\r\n2nd. Could it recover from its sickness, or was it incurable?\r\n\r\n3rd. Whether it should be killed, if it could not be cured?\r\n\r\n4th. Whether it should be eaten after it was killed?\r\n\r\nThe diseased, emaciated camel lay groaning just without the semicircle.\r\nThere was a large abscess over the shoulders, produced by the loads it\r\nhad carried, besides other sores. A million of flies was then settled on\r\nthe abscess, which was a running sore. It was a most disgusting sight.\r\nBut not to the people who eyed the poor animal as connoisseurs. I learnt\r\nafterwards the Kady's decision was: \"The camel is incurable, but may be\r\nkilled and eaten.\" I asked the people whether they were not afraid to eat\r\nan animal which was so much diseased. They replied, \"No, it is the\r\njudgment of the Kady. To-morrow we shall kill and eat it. To-day there's\r\ncamels' flesh enough.\" I was astonished at the Kady's decision, and told\r\nthe people diseased animals were not allowed to be killed for eating in\r\nour country, for there was danger in their making people ill. Some\r\napproved of this; but the population is much poorer than I, at first,\r\nthought, and the indigent are glad to catch anything. The few rich bury\r\ntheir money in foreign speculations, or hoard it up in their houses.\r\nAfter the decision, the miserable camel was left alone in the Souk, a\r\nprey to the flies, which were voraciously feeding on its running sores,\r\ntill the next day. Semi-civilized people cannot comprehend the mercy or\r\nduty of alleviating the sufferings of the inferior creation.\r\n\r\nTo-day a new case of severe ophthalmia. This was that of a woman, who\r\nalso had a fever. To my agreeable surprise, a number of her friends\r\ndecided that she should take a fever-powder, in spite of the Ramadan. I\r\nadministered it myself, and she drank it greedily. I was glad of such a\r\nmarked exception to the rigid fasting. Her relatives said she was\r\npermitted to drink it, first, because she was _a woman_, and, secondly,\r\nbecause she was sick. This was the law of the Kady. Met a remarkable\r\nTouarick in the streets. This is an old worn-out man, with one eye, and\r\nthat much damaged. In his day he has been a famous bandit, has plundered\r\nmany a caravan and murdered the hapless merchants. He is now, in his\r\ndreadful old age, sheltered in the very city whose wayfaring merchants he\r\nso often plundered and murdered. The judgment of heaven seems pressing\r\nhard upon him; for he is poor and miserable, a beggar in the streets--all\r\nhis ill-gotten wealth is gone! He leads about a little lad, whom he calls\r\nhis son, and who seems to afford the wretched old villain his only repose\r\nof mind, if repose he can have from so horrible a conscience. I gave the\r\nchild a small coin. The inhabitants feed the bandit, and tolerate him\r\nwith an admirable spirit of merciful forgiveness. And if _they_ do, who\r\ncries for vengeance?\r\n\r\nWrote to-day a letter to the Pasha of Tripoli, thanking His Highness for\r\nthe kind attentions I had received from the Governor of Ghadames. I never\r\ndid anything with such good will. It was, besides, an absolute duty.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon examined phrenologically, _bump_ologically, the heads of\r\nmany children. There was a considerable variety in the _bumps_, as well\r\nas the configuration, of the cranium. Some of the heads were well\r\nflattened on either side, others rounded, and mostly low, depressed\r\nforeheads, with \"self-esteem\" and \"love of approbation\" ascending\r\nappallingly far up at the back of the head. Very few men or children have\r\nthe frontal regions well developed. Examined a man esteemed a great\r\ndervish, who is always reading and writing the Koran. It's strange that\r\nthe saint had the organ of veneration well developed. The Rais hearing of\r\nmy cunning in this occult science, which some of the people called a new\r\n_deen_, (\"religion,\") wished to see me perform; so, on visiting him in\r\nthe evening, he ordered forth all his understrappers and hangers-on, and\r\nmade them submit to the fearful ordeal of head _pummelling_, first\r\nbegging me to speak out everything, and then calling for fire to light\r\nhis pipe, that he might muse over the exhibition _à la Turque_. The first\r\nofficer examined was collector of the revenue, a native of Derge, a\r\nregular task-master in his way, and very malicious; I was frightened\r\nwhat to say. All was attention, the Rais particularly wishing to know if\r\nhe was a thief, and had secreted Government money in his house. This his\r\nExcellency told me afterwards, when we were alone. The collector\r\nhappened, by good luck, to have a large \"acquisitiveness,\" and\r\n\"benevolence\" at the same time. This I explained to the Rais, and said\r\nthe one balanced or neutralized the other. Tayeb, (\"good\"), said his\r\nExcellency, much chagrined, his Excellency evidently wishing to have had\r\nthe fellow made out a thief. I must not continue through all the\r\nexaminations. Suffice it to say, by this display of my new craft, I was\r\nraised very much in the estimation of everybody. But the most surprising\r\nthing was, a Touarick affirmed to the Rais, with great vehemence, that\r\none of his neighbours was a phrenologist, and acquired his knowledge from\r\nthe _jenoun_ (\"demons\"). The major-domo of his Excellency, (who had had a\r\ngood character given to him in the examination,) was very angry at this\r\nattempt to lower my credit of being the first to teach phrenology in the\r\nThe Desert, and pushed the Touarick out of the Rais's house, and we only\r\njust escaped a disturbance, or losing all our fun, the Touarick drawing\r\nhis sword to defend himself. In general I was disappointed, and did not\r\nobserve the African and Moorish forms of cranium so much marked as I\r\nexpected. They were all, thank goodness, pretty cleanly shaved. It is\r\nwell known Mussulmans generally shave their heads, and leave their beards\r\nunshaven. This is, then, a splendid field for accurate phrenological\r\nobservation. I observed that the negroes have all of them \"self-esteem\"\r\nmost surprisingly developed. From this, (if the science were true, which\r\nI very much question[27],) we could easily deduce their habitual gaiety,\r\nfor a man who has always a good opinion of himself is rarely miserable.\r\n\r\nJust after the examination finished, whilst we were all very gay,\r\nsmoking, drinking coffee, talking, and laughing, one of the Moors started\r\nup suddenly, and in an instant, taking his shoe, lying beside him, struck\r\nsomething down with a great smack on the floor; it turned out to be an\r\nimmense scorpion! I felt a chill start through all my blood. The smashed\r\nreptile looked hideous in the dim light of the Ramadan lamp. This is the\r\nthird scorpion within a fortnight the Rais has killed in his own house;\r\none of enormous size he killed a few days ago. The Rais called for more\r\ncoffee, and said coolly and laconically, \"It's all _maktoub_ between you\r\nand the scorpions; if they are to bite you, they will.\" His Excellency\r\nthought the sting often deadly. My taleb joins the rest in their notions\r\nof fatality. In coming home with me afterwards, I said to him, \"I am\r\nalarmed at these scorpions, as there's no security from them; for you say\r\nthey get upon the beds, on the tops of the houses, and in every hole and\r\ncorner.\" The taleb--\"I am not afraid; I am always killing them in my\r\nhouse, and yet I fear them not, for it's all from God. If they are\r\ndestined by _Rubbee_ to sting me to death, they will, so I do not disturb\r\nmyself. You Christians are foolish.\" It does not appear that this reptile\r\nstrikes a person unless it be attacked, or trodden upon. The people say\r\nthey feed on _trāb_, \"dust\" or \"dirt.\" Yesterday the chameleon was seen\r\nin the gardens: there is a few in Ghadames, and in most parts of North\r\nAfrica. The one I saw was a most unsightly creature. The construction of\r\nthe eyes is remarkable; they turn on a swivel, or seem to do so, and are\r\ndirected every way in a moment of time. It is a trite observation, that\r\nthe lower brute animal has many advantages over the more perfect and\r\nrational animal. I often, _en route_, admired the beautiful facility with\r\nwhich the camel turned its head and neck completely round, and looked\r\nupon objects in every direction, without even moving its body, or if in\r\nmotion, without stopping. I watched the chameleon a long time, to see it\r\n\"change its colour;\" it did so continually, but scarcely any of the\r\ncolours were agreeable or beautiful; they were mostly dunnish red and\r\nyellow, and sometimes black brown; often-times it was covered with spots,\r\nnow with stripes, now with neither one nor the other. Once it was an ugly\r\nblack, and then of a light pale-green yellow. The fewness of animals in\r\nthis oasis occasions me to record its appearance. The people mention two\r\nor three varieties of the species. They are fond of the chameleons, at\r\nleast, give them the full liberty of the gardens, without attempting to\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\nThe Sebâah, a freebooting tribe of Tunisian Arabs on the frontier, who\r\nsome two months ago plundered a Ghadames caravan near Gharian, have been\r\nmade to render up an account of the spoil. The Pasha of Tripoli wrote to\r\nthe Bey of Tunis, and the Bey has undertaken to make them surrender their\r\nbooty. The value is only about 1000 dollars, and forty camels. People are\r\nvery inquisitive about my personal affairs. They ask me repeatedly, why I\r\ndon't marry, or where are my wife and children? and add, \"for you are\r\ngetting old, and have plenty of money.\" I usually reply, \"I can't carry a\r\nwife about with me all over the world.\" In the Desert and all over North\r\nAfrica, it is looked upon as a species of disgrace for a man not to be\r\nmarried. It perhaps ought to be so everywhere; but our social system of\r\nEurope is become now so bad, that nearly half of the people cannot afford\r\nto marry. And so degraded in their feelings have become the lower classes\r\nof the British Isles, that many of those who do marry, marry with the\r\nclear understood determination of throwing their offspring upon the\r\npublic bounty. The Puseyite and Church alms-giving clergy, to their\r\nshame, encourage our miserable population in these most despicable\r\nsentiments, and tell the people it is their right as granted to them by\r\nthe founder and apostles of the Christian Church. Tyrants must have\r\nslaves, and priestly tyrants as well as other sorts of tyrants; it is\r\ntherefore necessary there should be propagated a race of slaves.\r\n\r\nThis morning the poor old blind man demands the strong medicine for his\r\neye. He says, \"I feel less pain in my eyes though I see no better.\" O\r\nDio! what a precious gift is sight--how persevering is this old man to\r\nsee again those sights of desert, palm, and oasis, which he saw in his\r\nyouthful days! Perhaps there is a tenth of the population of Ghadames\r\nnearly blind, or quite blind. The Sheikh Makouran has calculated the\r\nexpense from Ghadames to Kanou, and back, for me, at two hundred dollars.\r\nThe Moors are essentially children in some things. Young men, full grown,\r\ncarry about with them in their pockets a little bit of white sugar to\r\nsuck, stowed away in needlecases. To-day, a ghafalah of Touaricks,\r\ntwenty persons, left for Ghat. They took my letter for the Governor. The\r\nTouaricks are getting used to the sight of a Christian. My opinion is\r\nalso undergoing a favourable change towards them. Certainly, the best\r\ninformed of the Ghadamsee people give them a good character.\r\n\r\n_15th._--The Rais killed two more scorpions after I left him last night.\r\nA child was bitten a few days ago by a scorpion, and died to-day. His\r\nExcellency hopes they will disappear after the Ramadan. The scorpion,\r\nlike many other venemous and deadly animals, is a creature of _heat_, and\r\nin the winter is never seen. The scorpion usually comes out of his\r\nhiding-places, or the crevices of the walls, during night time, and is\r\nrarely seen in the day. Various remedies for its bite or sting, or\r\nstroke, are in vogue here. People usually employ garlic: they both eat it\r\nand rub it into the bitten or stricken part. Others cut round the stung\r\npart, and then rub over the whole with snuff. People persist that the\r\nscorpion eats dust, but that he is very fond of _striking Ben-Adam_ (\"the\r\nhuman race.\") Two nights after the scorpion affair with the Rais, to our\r\ndread and horror, Said killed a large one close by our beds. We always\r\nsleep upon the ground-floor on matting. He was dozing in the night, after\r\nhis Ramadan midnight meal, when the monster scrambled past by his head\r\nlike an enormous crab. In the morning he showed me his sting as a trophy\r\nof victory. We then examined all the walls in our sleeping apartment, and\r\nstopped up cracks and crevices. After a short time the scorpions were\r\nforgotten, or we got used to them; and the next one that Said had a chase\r\nafter, excited in me little attention. So I found, like the Moors,\r\nmyself a fatalist, or at least became reconciled to the presence of these\r\ndeath-stinging reptiles. I found eventually, in fact, the people killed\r\nthem with as much unconcern as we do spiders. The scorpion is the only\r\ncreature armed with the fatal power of destroying life, which, for the\r\npresent I hear of in the oases of The Sahara. The Arabs, in their hatred\r\nof the Touaricks, say, \"The scorpion and the Touarick are the only\r\nenemies you meet with in The Sahara.\"\r\n\r\n_16th._--The old worn-out bandit met me, and asked me to cure his\r\nrheumatic pains. \"Show me your tongue,\" I said. He flatly refused, as\r\nseveral persons were present. Then when I went away he came running after\r\nme, and tried to put out his tongue, but did not succeed. I told him to\r\ndrink plenty of hot broth, and go to bed. He seemed satisfied. An Arab\r\nsoldier afflicted with diarrhœa, came for medicine. He waited till the\r\nlast rays of the sun were seen to depart from the minaret's top, before\r\nhe would take his pills. Meanwhile, he gave me a catalogue of grievances,\r\nthe sum and substance of which was, \"he had nothing to eat.\" I questioned\r\nhim over and over again, and then, coming to the same stern conclusion, I\r\ngave him some supper. Some weeks ago the Rais gave each soldier 3\r\nTunisian piastres, about 1_s._ 10_d._ Since then they had had nothing.\r\nSubstantially, I believe, he spoke the truth, for these poor fellows are\r\nkept just above the starvation-to-death point. It is not surprising they\r\nwish to return to their homes, or Tripoli, and that they pilfer about the\r\ntown. Asking him why the Rais did not give them a few karoobs, he replied\r\nnaively, \"The Rais has none for us, but plenty to buy gold for his\r\nhorse's saddle.\" To-day, nor yesterday, could I buy any eatable meat. I\r\nmean mutton, for this is the ordinary meat of the place, and upon which I\r\nlive, with now and then a fowl. But in the Souk another camel was killed,\r\nand a great display was made of its meat. The camel was ill before\r\nkilled, but not so bad as the one already mentioned. Some fifty persons\r\nwere enjoying the sight of the camel being cut up, for the Moorish\r\nbutchers always cut up their meat into very small portions, sometimes not\r\nbigger than a couple of mouthsful. Before killed, the camel sold for one\r\nhundred and eight Tunisian piastres; the one on which the Kady gave\r\njudgment, only produced thirty-three. (Tunisian piastres vary from 7_d._\r\nto 9_d._)\r\n\r\nYesterday the weather sultry, and a few drops of rain fell on the parched\r\noasis--drops of ambrosia from the gods. To-day it is cloudy and cool, for\r\nthe first time since my residence here; a cool elastic sensation braces\r\nup my poor drooping frame.\r\n\r\nThe Moor picks up every bit, or little dirty scrap of paper he finds in\r\nthe streets, and places it in a hole of the wall, or upon a ledge, lest\r\nthere should be written on it, \"the name of God,\" and the sacred name be\r\ntrodden upon and profaned. It is probable they derived the superstition\r\nfrom the Jews, who have many mysterious notions about certain letters which\r\nform the name of The Almighty. I have often seen ‮שדי‬ affixed on\r\nthe door-posts of Jewish houses in Barbary. But no people in the world\r\nuse the name of God more vainly than Mussulmans, nor swear more than\r\nthey, the greater part of the words used being different epithets of the\r\nDivine Nature. This inconsistency runs through all the actions of these\r\nsemi-civilized people. No people pretend to more delicacy in the mode of\r\ndress, more respect for women, not even mentioning the names or existence\r\nof their wives. My late Marabout camel-driver, when speaking of his wife\r\nand family, merely said _saghar_ (\"little children\"). And,\r\nnotwithstanding all this, no people are more sensual and impure, and\r\nesteem women less, than the Moors of towns. In swearing and oaths, the\r\nepithets \"With God!\" \"By God!\" \"God!\" \"The Lord!\" or \"My Lord\r\n(_Rubbee_)!\" \"God, the Most High!\" and, \"The Most Sacred Majesty of God\r\n(_Subkhanah Allah_)!\" are the common forms of using the Divine Name. A\r\nTibboo stranger went into a house to buy a pair of pistols, and the\r\nseller was not at home. My taleb, who was a neighbour, and was anxious\r\nhis friend should sell his pistols, run about exclaiming, _Subkhanah\r\nAllah!_ I confess I was greatly shocked on hearing these most awful words\r\nused in such a way. I taxed the taleb afterwards with it, and compared\r\nhis conduct with what I had seen in his picking up bits of paper in my\r\nhouse, for fear the names of The Deity should be upon them. He merely\r\nanswered pettishly, \"What do you wish? all people say so.\" A less serious\r\nnote may be added here, that of the loose and curious way in which the\r\nArabs express their ideas of quantities and distances. \"Great\" and\r\n\"small\" means with them any quantities, as \"near\" and \"afar,\" any\r\ndistances. I asked an Arab of Tunis when he expected his caravan? He\r\nreplied, _Ghareeb_ (\"near\"). \"What do you mean, a week, a fortnight, or\r\nhow long?\" \"_Twenty days!_\" was the reply. In endeavouring to obtain\r\ninformation from these people on distances and quantities, the only way\r\nis to make them compare the thing unknown with what you know. They will\r\ntell you at such a place is an exceedingly high mountain. If there is a\r\nhill or a mountain near you at the time, you must ask them if it as large\r\nor larger than that? In this way you will frequently find their great\r\nmountain to be no bigger than a hillock.\r\n\r\nThe merchants say it is necessary to give presents to the following\r\nprinces of authority, in the route of Soudan:--\r\n\r\nTOUARICKS.\r\n\r\n    Governor of the town of Ghat;\r\n    The Sultan of the Touaricks of Ghat, and the surrounding districts;\r\n    The Sultan of Aheer; and\r\n    The Sultan of Aghadez:\r\n\r\nand these princes demand presents as a matter of right.\r\n\r\nFULLANNEE AND NEGROES.\r\n\r\n    The Governor of Damerghou;\r\n    The Sultan of Tesouwah;\r\n    The Deputy-Sultan of Kashna; and\r\n    The Deputy-Sultan of Kanou:\r\n\r\nbut these latter princes do not demand presents as a matter of right,\r\nleaving it to the good pleasure of the stranger. There are also a few\r\nother smaller places where a trifling present will help a merchant on his\r\nway. The presents are collected according to the means and wealth of each\r\nindividual merchant, each subscribing his share, one giving a burnouse,\r\nothers a piece of cloth, or silk, or beads, and what not. The whole is\r\nthen collected together, and a deputation of two or three merchants is\r\nformed out of the caravan, who convey their presents to the prince, and\r\nthe prince, when he finds the merchants have treated him liberally,\r\nsometimes returns a present of a slave or two, but generally a quantity\r\nof fresh provisions.\r\n\r\nA small ghafalah of Touaricks having left to-day for Touat, Sheik\r\nMakouran, whose merchandise they were escorting on its way to Timbuctoo,\r\nbegged me to write a letter to the Sheikh of Ain-Salah, one of the oases,\r\nwhich is in direct commercial relations with Ghadames. The plain English\r\nof the letter was, that Sheikh Haj Mohammed Welled Abajoudah, of\r\nAin-Salah, would receive me friendly if I came to him, would protect all\r\nEnglishmen travelling through his country, and would not let them be\r\nattacked and murdered as Major Laing was. When I gave my friend Makouran\r\nthe letter, he asked me what I had written. I related the substance.\r\n\"Allah, Allah!\" exclaimed old Makouran; \"Why, the Sheikh of Ain-Salah is\r\nmy friend, he'll treat you as kindly as I do; he's one of us.\" Then he\r\nadded, \"Never mind, the letter may go.\" This evening the Rais was very\r\nunwell. Gave his Excellency some purgative pills. Afraid he will be\r\nobliged to return to Tripoli for his health; poor fellow, he suffers\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\n_17th._--The weather has opened this morning, dull, cloudy, and cool,\r\nthreatening rain. A dingy veil is drawn over the face of things.\r\n\r\nHave not yet seen any pretty plays amongst the children. All is dullest\r\nmonotony. The youth, however, ultimately recover their wits by\r\ntravelling. My turjeman says, \"The natives of Ghadames are the greatest\r\ntravellers in the world, and are to be found in every country.\" The\r\n_Souk_ offers nothing for sale but olive-oil, liquid butter, a little\r\nbread, camels' flesh, and now and then a few vegetables. All the\r\nTouarick traders have now left, some for Ghat and others for Touat. My\r\nGhadamsee friends cease talking of the dangers of my Soudan trip, and it\r\nis a settled thing that I go. Some of them wish me to try a fasting day;\r\n\"one day, to see how I like it,\" they tell me.\r\n\r\nIt is very amusing to see butchers in this place cut up their meat. Four,\r\neight, or twelve persons, join to buy a sheep. The sheep is killed, and\r\nthe butcher has to divide it into as many equal parts as\r\njoint-purchasers. He begins by dividing it into four equal parts, but not\r\nin the way we should imagine, by cutting the carcase into four. No, quite\r\ndifferent. He first divides the intestines into four portions, cutting\r\nthe heart, liver, and lights into four equal portions, and so of the\r\nrest. Sometimes the heart is made a present to some favoured individual.\r\nOf two sheep cut up to-day, the heart of one was given to a young friend\r\nof mine, and that of the other to the Governor. The intestines divided,\r\nthe butcher proceeds to divide the legs and shoulders into four equal\r\nportions, dividing one leg and one shoulder into two, and so of the\r\nother. The ribs and rest of the meat is then also equally divided. When\r\nthe carcase is thus far divided, a few persons only take one whole\r\nquarter, the rest the butcher proceeds leisurely and scientifically to\r\ndivide, several persons taking a whole quarter divided and subdivided\r\namongst them, not being able to purchase a large quantity. The quarter is\r\ndivided into half-quarters, the half-quarters into quarter-quarters, and\r\nthe quarter-quarter is often again divided and subdivided before it gets\r\ninto the pot. In this division, you would imagine the Desert dissector\r\nwould cut the meat all away;--no such thing; and so great is the\r\nprecision with which he divides and subdivides, that he has no need of\r\nscales and weights, equally dividing every bit of muscle, cartilage, fat,\r\nand bone; indeed, every person goes away perfectly satisfied with the\r\njustice of the division. I never saw scales and weights used on these\r\noccasions. Should, perchance, a difficulty or dispute arise as to the\r\ncomparative size of the portions or equal divisions, a child is then sent\r\nfor, and each party having chosen his token--a piece of wood, a straw, or\r\nwhat not, the whole are put into the hands of the child, who is requested\r\nto place the sticks or straws upon the portions of meat it chooses, or to\r\nwhich its caprice may guide. This decision of the umpire Chance is\r\nwithout or beyond all appeal. Mussulmans of The Sahara have no idea of\r\n_separate joints_ or choice parts, the heart, perhaps, excepted, which is\r\nhighly prized; or, if you will, they like a bit of every part of the\r\ncarcase, and cut it up into these infinitesimal divisions in order that\r\nthey may obtain this aggregate of delicate minutiæ. But as this is all\r\ncooked together, there can never be that separate taste of separate parts\r\nwhich distinguishes the meat as killed and cooked by Europeans. All\r\nMussulmans are instinctively butchers, and are familiar with the knife,\r\nand expert at killing animals; it is a sort of religious rite with them.\r\nWhat I have observed particularly is, there is none of that shrinking\r\nback and chilled-blood shudder at seeing a poor animal killed, which\r\ncharacterizes Europeans, and especially the children of Europeans. Here\r\nchildren may be seen holding the animal whilst its throat is most\r\nbarbarously cut! and not flinching a step, or blinking the eye. Apropos\r\nof killing and eating meat, I had a long polemical discussion with my\r\ntaleb upon the respective rites and ceremonies of Christians and\r\nMussulmans. I told him what distinguished the religion of the New\r\nTestament was, that it prescribed no rules for eating and drinking, or\r\ndress; that the whole Christian religion was based upon two great\r\ncommandments: \"Thou shalt love God with all thy heart, and thy neighbour\r\nas thyself.\" This, however, only drew from him the observation, \"Before\r\nthe time of Sidi Mahomet, this was the religion of the world.\" I\r\nrejoined, \"This was the religion--still is the religion--of all the\r\nEnglish, who eat and drink everything that is good, and dress any way\r\nthey please; and such is the will of God.\" The taleb observed, \"You wear\r\nbraces, which is unlawful.\" I could not find out the why and the\r\nwherefore, unless it were that it tightened men-folks up too much for\r\nmodesty. I told him the Rais and all Turks had braces to their\r\npantaloons. He simply replied, \"Braces are not permitted by our\r\nmarabouts.\"\r\n\r\nNorth Africa, or this region of The Sahara, more particularly, is\r\nessentially the East, (the Syrian, Arabian East,) and the religion\r\nof Mahomet has indissolubly bound in ideas, manners, and customs,\r\nthe inhabitants of these countries with those of the East. It is,\r\ntherefore, very satisfactory to read the _Arabic_ New Testament in\r\nthese countries; for, besides presenting all the ideas and\r\nmetaphorical adornments, such reading often gives you the very words\r\nand idiomatical expressions of the people. This correspondence is\r\ncertainly a strong proof, both that the latter Biblical writers were\r\nnatives of the East, and that the inhabitants of North Africa and\r\nThe Sahara were originally emigrants, or colonies from Syria and\r\nArabia. This is the opinion of my taleb, and all the literati of the\r\noasis. My taleb also treated me to-day with writing the famous\r\nMohammedan prophecy, respecting the destinies of the East, and the\r\nworld in general, and everybody in particular. It runneth according to\r\nthis mighty import: \"_The Dajal_, (‮الدجال‬,) whose name is the\r\nMessiah, and who is the son of Said, and who is a monstrous fellow,\r\nwith one eye, shall come upon the earth, or rather, go abroad upon\r\nthe earth, and all the Jews shall flock around him, and enrol\r\nthemselves under his standard, for he is their expected Messiah; and\r\nthen, armed with their prowess and gold, he shall slay all\r\nChristians and Mohammedans, and shall reign upon the earth, after\r\ntheir destruction, forty years. This time outran, there shall then\r\nappear Jesus, the son of Mary, (the Messiah of the New Testament,)\r\nin the clouds, who shall descend upon the earth with flaming\r\nvengeance, and destroy _The Dajal_. This done, then shall come the\r\nend of the world.\" My taleb assures me, upon his _parole d'honneur_,\r\nthat _The Dajal_ will come in forty years from the present time, or\r\nin the year 1885! Khoristan, the country where he is now bound in chains,\r\nis, besides, the country of Gog and Magog (‮جوج و مجوج‬).\r\nOne of these gentlemen is very small, indeed a dwarf, about the size\r\nof General Tom Thumb, perhaps one and a half inches shorter; and the\r\nother is tall enough to reach the moon when it is high over your\r\nhead. It is strange the Mussulmans of Ghadames make also the Turks\r\n(_Truk_, as they call them,) to come from the country of Gog and\r\nMagog. See the following table of the genealogy of all the people of\r\nthe earth, especially the Turks, the Touaricks, and the Russians:--\r\n\r\n                                 Noah.\r\n                                   |\r\n            +----------------------+----------------+\r\n            |                                       |\r\n          Shem.

Touaricks.\r\n                                               |\r\n                                           +--------+\r\n                                           |        |\r\n                                            Russians.\r\n\r\nSuch is the leaf of holy tradition in The Desert. It is astonishing\r\nhow all nations love to indulge their gloomy musings with monsters.\r\nThe extraction of the Russians from Gog and Magog is a curiosity; but\r\nthe Russians, (_Moskou_, such is their name here,) are looked upon as\r\na species of monster, whose jaw is capacious enough to swallow up all\r\nthe Turks, and the Sultan of the East. The Rais has the greatest dread\r\nof them, whose native soil they have already gorged, \"These Russians,\"\r\nhe said to me one day, \"are always, always, always advancing,\r\nadvancing, advancing upon the Sultan.\" Who will say the patriotic\r\nTurk's apprehensions are groundless? With regard to the extraction of\r\nthe Touaricks, I asked one of these people where his countrymen sprang\r\nfrom. He answered me, that formerly they were demons, (‮جنون‬) and\r\ncame from a country near Kanou, on the banks of The Great River.\r\nAnother told me, in true Hellenic style, \"The Touaricks sprang out\r\nfrom the ground.\" An opinion has been advanced by some acquainted with\r\nancient Eastern and African geography, that the Touaricks are from\r\nPalestine, and are a portion of the tribes of the Philistines expelled\r\nby Joshua; that the first rendezvous of the wanderers was the oasis of\r\n_Oujlah_, which is a few days' journey from _Siwah_, the site of the\r\ncelebrated _Ammonium_; and thence they proceeded, wandering at will,\r\nto the west and south, peopling all the arid regions of the Sahara.\r\nThe Sheikh of the slaves visiting me to-day, and describing Timbuctoo,\r\nsaid, \"It is several times larger than Tunis; it is as large as\r\n_Moskou_ (or Russia).\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Who told you _Moskou_ was large?\"\r\n\r\n_He._--\"The people.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Emperor of all the Russians may rejoice in the consciousness, that\r\nhe and his people constitute as large a kingdom as Timbuctoo, and are\r\ncelebrated in the gossip of Saharan cities.\r\n\r\nThe first thing with which people break their fast in the evening is\r\n_dates_. My taleb, when visiting me, takes a few dates in his hands, and\r\ngoes to a corner of the court-yard, or upon the house-top, about the\r\nsoftening, musing time, when the last solar rays are lingering\r\nplayfully--and to the emaciated faster, teasingly, on this Saharan world,\r\nand there he listens in silence for the first accents of the shrill voice\r\nof the _Muethan_, calling to prayers, from the minaret of a neighbouring\r\nmosque. This heard, he commences putting the dates, one by one, slowly\r\ninto his parched mouth, repeating a short prayer with each as he swallows\r\nit with a sort of choking difficulty. After he has eaten a dozen or so,\r\nhe drinks, and then goes off to mosque prayers. Sometimes he prays in my\r\nhouse, and then comes down to dine with me. Many people, of course, in\r\nGhadames, never saw a Christian before me; but they are quite as much\r\nastonished to see a Christian eat and drink in the Ramadan, as to see the\r\nChristian himself. This afternoon I was very thirsty, and went to drink a\r\nlittle water from one of the water-skins suspended in a square. A woman,\r\nof half-caste, going by at the time, cried out, \"Why, why?\" I went up to\r\nher and said, \"Because you are a Mussulman and I'm a Christian.\" Her\r\nastonishment was no way abated; she kept exclaiming, \"Why, why?\" as if\r\nshe would raise the whole city. One of my merchant friends seeing there\r\nwas some prospect of a disturbance, came up to me and said, \"Yâkob, that\r\nwoman is mad; make haste, go home.\" However, I rarely ever eat and drink\r\nbefore the people, avoiding as much as I can shocking their prejudices;\r\nand if asked about fasting, usually evade the question, or say I fast or\r\nwait for my dinner till Said can eat his dinner also.\r\n\r\n_18th._--Weather has now set in cool. This morning a little cold and raw.\r\nNow's the time for catching coughs and cold;--people are coughing\r\nalready. Just before day-break, a thunderbolt was said to be discharged\r\nover the city, accompanied with a long, low growling muttering sound,\r\nwhich reverberated from the Saharan hills. The circumstance remarkable,\r\nin the falling of this dread bolt of heaven's artillery, at the time the\r\nsky was perfectly clear and bright, and there was nothing in the shape of\r\nstorm. These discharges of sound are rare in the Saharan regions. People\r\nasked me to explain to them what it was, and what it prognosticated? I\r\ntold them, thunderbolts were frequent in Christian countries during\r\nstorms, and nothing of consequence follow from them. I have reason to\r\nbelieve since, after conversing with several French officers in Algeria\r\non the subject, that this phenomenon of a tremendous discharge of sound\r\nwas a discharge of electricity _from the earth_, which sometimes occurs\r\nin North Africa.\r\n\r\nWent to examine the Great Spring of Ghadames this morning, which is\r\nsituate on the west side of the city, but conveniently between the two\r\ngrand divisions of the population, the Ben Wezeet and the Ben Weleed. It\r\nwas to me a _delicium_. What a revolution has my opinions undergone\r\nrespecting water since I have travelled in The Thirsty Desert! Never was\r\nsuch an enthusiastic conversion! But were all conversions so harmless,\r\nhow happy for mankind! Some thirty swallows are skimming its\r\ngaseous-bubble surface, playing off their wing-darting delights. The\r\nSpring or Well is perennial, as old as the foundation of the city, and\r\nmay have ran for ages before the palms were planted around it by the hand\r\nof man, or sprung up from a few date-stones left by some chance fugitives\r\nwho had stopped to taste its waters, and then held their way on in The\r\nDesert. Without the Spring the city could have no existence. It runs into\r\na basin made and banked up for it, an oblong square of some twenty yards\r\nby fifteen. In its deepest part it is not more than six feet. The water\r\nis hot, averaging a temperature of 120 degrees, and upwards, it being too\r\nhot to bathe in near the orifices, whence the water gushes with gaseous\r\nglobules, which continually rise from the bottom. But the orifices are\r\nnot visible, and hence an air of mystery is thrown over this spring of\r\n\"Living Water.\" The people say it was created by God on the same day when\r\nthe sea near Tripoli was made. The gaseous particles are larger and more\r\nnumerous in the centre, where is the great force of the Spring. The water\r\nis tolerably good, but a little purgative. It is usually allowed twelve,\r\nbut some give it twenty-four hours to cool before drunk. The form of the\r\nbasin may be thus rudely represented:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA. Small bathing-places.\r\n\r\nB. Steps where the women descend to fill their jugs with water.\r\n\r\nC. Corners where the water runs away to the fountains in the squares and\r\nstreets, and to the gardens, in and without the city. Around are the\r\nruins and backs of houses, walls, and gardens, the palms alone being\r\nvisible, looking very fresh and gracefully picturesque, near this source\r\nof life. After this went to see the _Water-Watch_[28], which is placed in\r\none corner of the Souk. This is constructed upon the same principle as\r\nthe hour-glass, but it is small, and requires to be emptied twenty-four\r\ntimes to complete the hour. In fact, it is only a small earthen pot or\r\njar with a hole in the bottom of certain dimensions, and when filled with\r\nwater, and the water has emptied itself, running out twenty-four times,\r\nthe hour is completed. Some gardens require the stream, which the\r\n_Water-Watch_ measures the time of the running of, an hour, others only\r\nhalf an hour, and others two or more hours, according to their size and\r\ndistance from the source. The inhabitants pay Government so much per hour\r\nfor the running of the stream into their gardens; but some have an\r\nhereditary possession in a certain quantity of the time of the stream's\r\nrunning. Of this they are naturally very proud. For ordinary household\r\npurposes the water is given without cost. There are two or three places\r\nin the town where a small water-watch is kept, but that in the Souk is\r\nthe principal one. I have thus entered into particulars, for the obvious\r\nreason that, \"water is the liquid gold in these thirsty regions.\" In\r\nSouthern Algeria, the oasis of El-Agouat, each landed proprietor has the\r\nprescriptive right of an hour or two hours of the running of the water,\r\naccording to the title deeds of the estate. The time is measured with an\r\nhour-glass (of sand) held by the officer who distributes the water, and\r\nwho opens and shuts the conduit of irrigation at the time fixed. Many\r\nother oases have the same system.\r\n\r\nSome Touaricks remained, who called on me to-day. One, who had shown\r\nhimself very friendly, began to enlarge on the dangers of the Soudan\r\nroute. I immediately observed, \"God is greater than all the Touaricks.\"\r\nThis stopped his gab, and was applauded by the rest. A Ghadamsee bawled\r\nout, \"Oh! it requires a great deal--much, much, much money to go to\r\nSoudan.\" \"How much?\" I asked,--\"Oh! much, much, much!\" was rejoined.\r\n\"What is _much_?\" \"Five hundred dollars!\" was shouted out by half a\r\ndozen. I coolly observed, \"It is not much for an Englishman.\" Another of\r\nthe Touaricks said, about twenty years ago he saw some Englishmen come to\r\nhis country from Fezzan. What struck the Touarick was, the English\r\ntourists gave a dollar for a fowl, for a drink of milk, and even, he\r\nadded with an oath, for an _Es-Slamah âleikom_? (\"How do you do?\") This\r\nstory was told to impress me with the necessity of taking plenty of money\r\nwith me, and I was to keep up the liberal character of my predecessors\r\nin Saharan travel. So we see these English tourists, who undoubtedly were\r\nMessrs. Denham, Clapperton, and Oudney, have spoiled the roads of\r\ntravelling between Ghat and Fezzan, as Englishmen have spoiled the routes\r\nof the Continent of Europe. This is the propensity of John Bull, to buy\r\nup everything and everybody abroad[29]. The Touarick added, \"A deal of\r\nmoney is required, because there are many banditti.\" He meant not exactly\r\nrobbers, but beggars, who, whilst begging, give you to understand that\r\ntheir appeal to your eleemosynary feelings must not be in vain. All who\r\nbeg _impudently_ on the routes, or who levy black-mail, are called\r\n_Sbandout_ (\"banditti.\") But I'm more convinced than ever, that the\r\ngreatest shield of safety for the Desert traveller is his poverty.\r\n\r\nSaw an aged Moorish lady, who greatly interested me. She told me she was\r\nan hundred years old, fasted all day long, and expected soon to go to\r\nParadise. It is undoubtedly a vulgar error to say the Mahometan doctrine\r\nteaches that women have no souls. During her hundred years, she had never\r\nseen a Christian before. Her faculties were too weak for sectarian spite,\r\nand she looked upon me as if I had been a simple Mussulman stranger.\r\n\r\nSunset, this evening, a man proclaimed from the housetops the arrival of\r\nthe ghafalah, long expected from Tripoli: only a courier arrived. By him\r\nI received the first letter from Tripoli, and the first newspaper, the\r\n_Malta Times_! That mark of admiration means, gentle reader, my poor old\r\npaper, the paper I established at so much cost and waste of time, money,\r\nhealth, and labour, for the good pleasure and caprice of The Island of\r\nMalta and its dependencies. It's yet pleasing to see the old paper\r\nfollowing me; it will, perhaps, follow at my heels to Central Africa.\r\nRamadan began a day earlier in Tripoli. The courier, also, brings the\r\nnews, banditti are prowling about the The Mountains attacking isolated\r\ntravellers and small caravans. I am sorry to see, by my papers, the\r\npeople advocates of their own slavery, and that the Texans have carried\r\nthrough their Congress \"the Annexation with the United States,\" the\r\nrepublican patrons and upholders of slavery and the slave-trade! In this\r\ncase, at any rate, 'it is not kings and despots enslaving mankind,' but\r\nthe people wilfully forging their own chains. There is also a humble case\r\nbefore my eyes. Here sits by my side, the slave of Haj Abd-Errahman, who\r\nis sent every year by his master to buy and sell goods, as if a regular\r\nfree merchant. It is wonderful fidelity on the part of this slave that he\r\ndoes not run away. Unquestionably the negro has some fine qualities. This\r\nslave, however, in palliation of the wrong, tells me he brings few\r\nslaves, and mostly goods. I don't fail to tell him, slaves are _haram_,\r\n(\"prohibited,\") to the English. My taleb comes in, and after asking me\r\nthe news, takes up the Arabic Bible, and reads the following beautiful\r\nprophetic sentiment:\r\n\r\n    ‮ولكثرة الاثم تبرد المحبة من كثير‬\r\n\r\nand then asks what it means? \"_And because iniquity shall abound, the\r\nlove of many shall wax cold_,\" I reply, \"may be illustrated in this way:\r\nSuppose the Rais buys up or bribes the people, so that nearly all the\r\npeople applaud whatever he does, whether right or wrong, then the love of\r\nyour country, amongst you few faithful remaining, will wax cold?\"\r\n\r\n_Ben Mousa._--\"Yes, I understand, _Seedna Aysa_, ('our Lord Jesus,') was\r\na prophet.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[27] I always thought phrenology too good to be true. Such a\r\n    study, however, may be of some service in classifying mental\r\n    phenomena, and induce a taste for metaphysical research.\r\n\r\n[28] _Mungalah_ or _Saah-el-ma_. Watches are very uncommon: only\r\n    the Governor, and a few of the richest people, have a watch.\r\n\r\n[29] Once passing through Lyons, I heard of an English tourist who\r\n    hired a steam-boat to himself to pass down the Rhone in, hired an\r\n    hotel to himself, and one evening took the upper part of a theatre\r\n    to himself, including the boxes, and all to enjoy himself\r\n    _tranquillement_, said my French informant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFAST OF THE RAMADAN.\r\n\r\n     The Women in possession of the Streets.--The Grand Factions of\r\n     Ghadames, the _Ben Weleed_ and the _Ben Wezeet_.--Interest of the\r\n     People in Algerian Affairs.--Names, from Bodily\r\n     Deformities.--Starving Slaves makes them Thieves.--Disease of the\r\n     _Arak-el-Abeed_.--Finances of Ghadames.--The Prophet Jonah, still\r\n     living.--Bad system of collecting Taxes by common\r\n     Soldiers.--Essnousee leaves for Ghat, alone.--The _Thob_.--Stroke\r\n     of the Moon.--Mission of Impostors always that of pretended Mercy\r\n     to Men.--How the Turk governs the Arabs.--Saharan\r\n     _Lady_-Gentlemen.--Classic and Vulgar Names of Things.--The\r\n     _Wadan_, or _Oudad_.--Nimrod, the Hercules of the Saharan\r\n     Moors.--Enoch, a Tailor.--Noah, a Carpenter.--Serpents and\r\n     Monsters in The Desert.--Teach Geography to the\r\n     People.--Indolence of the Inhabitants of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_19th._--MORNING spent in spelling the Malta Times. Saw a Ben-Wezeetee,\r\nwho protested that all the money of the country was in the hands of the\r\nBen-Weleed. I asked if he ever went to the Ben-Weleed. \"For what,\" he\r\nreplied angrily, \"should I go to see those devils?\" In the afternoon\r\nfound all the streets deserted by the men-folks, and in possession of the\r\nwomen, girls, and little children, who were playing all sorts of pranks,\r\nand dancing and singing like so many people let loose from Bedlam. As\r\nsoon as they saw me there was a simultaneous rush at me, all crying out,\r\n\"Oh, Christian! Christian! where's your mother? where's your sister?\r\nwhere's your wife?--don't you want a wife?\" Then they began to pelt me\r\nwith date-stones. I got out of the way as quickly as possible. Wondered\r\nwhat in the world had become of the men. At last found them and the boys\r\nall congregated round a mosque, this being some important ceremony of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nI had to-day some talk about the two great political factions, the\r\n_Ben-Wezeet_ and the _Ben-Weleed_, the Whigs and Tories of Ghadames, but\r\npushed to such extremities of party spirit, as almost to be without the\r\nlimits of humanity. Notwithstanding the assumed sanctity of this holy and\r\n_Marabout_ City of Ghadames, and its actually leaving its walls to\r\ncrumble away, and its gates open to every robber of the highways of The\r\nDesert--trusting to its prayers for its defence and to its God for\r\nvengeance--it has nourished for centuries upon centuries the most\r\nunnatural and fratricidal feuds within its own bosom, dividing itself\r\ninto two powerful rival factions, and which factions, to this day, have\r\nnot any _bonâ fide_ social intercourse with one another. Occasionally one\r\nor two of the rival factions privately visit each other, but these are\r\nexceptions, and the Rais has the chiefs of the two parties together in\r\nDivan on important business being brought before him. In the market-place\r\nthere is likewise ground of a common and neutral rendezvous. Abroad they\r\nalso travel together, and unite against the common enemy and the\r\nforeigner. The native Governor, or _Nāther_, and the _Kady_, are besides\r\nchosen from one or other party, and have authority over all the\r\ninhabitants of Ghadames. But here closes their mutual transactions. It is\r\na long settled time-out-of-mind, nay, sacred rule, with them, as a whole,\r\n\"Not to intermarry, and not to visit each other's quarters, if it can\r\npossibly be avoided.\" The Rais and myself, reside without the boundaries\r\nof their respective quarters, so that we can be visited by both parties,\r\nwho often meet together accidentally in our houses. The Arab suburb is\r\nalso neutral ground. Most of the poor strangers take up their residence\r\nhere. The _Ben-Wezeet_ have four streets and the _Ben-Weleed_ three.\r\nThese streets have likewise their subdivisions and chiefs, but live\r\namicably with one another, so far as I could judge. The people generally\r\nare very shy of conversing with strangers about their ancient immemorial\r\nfeuds. I could only learn from the young men that in times past the two\r\nfactions fought together with arms, and \"some dreadful deeds were done.\"\r\nMy taleb only wrote the following when I asked him to give some\r\nhistorical information respecting these factions:--\"The Ben Weleed and\r\nthe Ben Wezeet are people of Ghadames, who have quarrelled from time\r\nimmemorial: it was the will of God they should be divided, and who shall\r\nresist his will? Yâkob, be content to know this!\"\r\n\r\nBut the Rais boasts of having done something to mitigate the mutual\r\nantipathies of the factions. \"The _Shamātah_, between them,\" he says,\r\n\"has had its neck broken.\" And really, if it be the case, there is in\r\nthis some compensation for the wrongs and miseries which the Turks are\r\ninflicting upon an impoverished and over burthened people. In other parts\r\nof Northern Sahara similar factions exist, often arising from chance\r\ndivisions of towns. There is a similar division of the town of Ghabs in\r\nTunis, but not carried to such extreme lengths as these factions of\r\nGhadames. It would seem that society could not exist without party and\r\ndivisions no more than a British Parliament. Even Scripture intimates\r\nthere must be strifes and divisions.\r\n\r\nMany came to me to hear the news from Tripoli and Algeria. I found them\r\nall interested in the fate and fortunes of the latter country. Some vague\r\nrumours had reached them of serious and bloody skirmishes. I calmed them,\r\ntelling them \"all people were on an equal footing in Algeria, Christians\r\nas Mussulmans, even as Mussulmans were in our British India.\" Some\r\ndoubted my information. Late in the evening, when the visitors of the\r\nRais had retired, I had a tête-à-tête with his Excellency. Speaking of\r\nthe Ghadamseeah, his Excellency said, \"They are ignorant and know not the\r\n_tareek_ (_i. e._, system) of the Sultan; they magnify every trifle of\r\nnews they hear, and are now alive to every change, and in feverish\r\nexpectation of some new event.\" This is always the case with the\r\noppressed; they must love change, if but for the worse. His Excellency\r\nthen continued: \"Since the forced contribution of fifty thousand dollars,\r\nno money is to be found. The money due for the past four months is still\r\nuncollected.\" Speaking of the bandits, his Excellency said, \"The Pasha\r\nhas written to me that he cannot allow me, or the Commandant of The\r\nMountains, to march out against the _Sebâah_ or _Shânbah_, without an\r\norder from the Sultan, but with such an order we could soon exterminate\r\nthem.\" Our Rais does not entirely neglect the intellectual edification of\r\nhis Desert subjects. This evening, early, he amused them with talking\r\nabout steamboats, or \"boats of fire.\" I put in a word about railroads,\r\ntelling them with a railway we could come from Tripoli to Ghadames in two\r\ndays. \"The Christians know all things but God,\" said a Marabout.\r\n\r\n_20th._--Weather is now cool, and I can walk about the gardens at\r\nmid-day without inconvenience. I enjoy this much, amusing myself\r\nwith throwing stones at the ripe dates, which fall in luscious\r\nclusters into one's mouth. Eating fruit in the gardens or from the\r\ntrees is also a peculiar delight enjoyed by people of all countries\r\nand climates. Several of the people are so ignorant of printing that\r\nthey call my newspapers letters, and this is natural enough, as\r\nthere are no other but manuscript books amongst them.--‮سمعان\r\nالابرص‬, \"Simon _the Leper_\" (Matt. xxvi.). It is usual here to\r\ndistinguish people in this way: as \"Mohammed, _the one-eyed_,\"\r\n\"Ahmed, _the lame-with-one-leg_,\" and \"Mustapha, _the red-beard_.\"\r\nSo the famous pirate of the Mediterranean was called \"_Barbarossa_.\"\r\nThe people are not at all ashamed of being called by their natural\r\ndeformities, as we are in Europe. ‮قمقم‬ is one of the numerous\r\nwords in Arabic where the sound corresponds with the sense.\r\n_Ghemghem_ is, \"to murmur,\" and the English word itself is not a bad\r\nexample of the kind. The Mussulmans have very grotesque notions of\r\nthe Christian doctrine of Trinity. A person said: \"Do not the\r\nChristians say God has a Son?\" \"Yes,\" I replied. The rejoinder was,\r\n\"That is making God like a bullock (‮بقر‬)!\" My friend the Touatee,\r\na native of Touat, tells me the Touaricks were originally from\r\nTimbuctoo, and so say all Touat Touaricks. The ghafalah just arrived\r\nfrom Tripoli has brought eighty camel-loads of barley. Observed the\r\nhead of the little son of the Touarick bandit. Fancied it was really\r\nthe infantile cast of such a parent's head. This is the danger of\r\nthe science, prejudicing you in such matters.\r\n\r\nApparently, what little thieving there is going on here is committed by\r\nthe Arabs and slaves. There are three or four of these latter most\r\ndetermined date stealers. One of these slaves was brought up yesterday\r\nand received two hundred bastinadoes; but it had not much effect upon\r\nhim. When these offenders become incurable, the Rais packs them off to\r\nTripoli. A very good plan, which keeps the country free of offences of\r\npetty larceny. However, many of these slaves steal because they have not\r\nenough to eat: thus we come to the old circle again, that poverty is the\r\nmother of crime. So is it with the Arabs and slaves of Ghadames. The\r\nslaves are mostly devout, if not fanatic Mussulmans. They have a right to\r\nbe fanatical, for their religion is a great protection to them. Their\r\nmasters, not like the _Christian_ slave-masters of the Southern States of\r\nAmerica, who close the Bible against the slave, are also proud of the\r\nfanaticism of their slaves, and teach them verses of the Koran. The\r\nslave's conception of the dogmas of his religion is slow and confused. My\r\nNegro Said is a good Mussulman, and keeps his fast well, but I never yet\r\ncaught him at his prayers, nor does he go much to the mosque. Yesterday I\r\ncame suddenly upon two youngsters, the Rais's slaves, who at mid-day were\r\ndevouring roasted locusts and drinking water, in the style of sumptuous\r\nfeasting. I called out, \"Holloa! how now? are you feasting or fasting?\"\r\nThey began laughing and then handed me some roast locusts, to bribe me\r\nnot to blab. My taleb caught a slave in my house eating also roasted\r\nlocusts, and asked him if he should like to be roasted in hell-fire?\r\n\r\n_21st._--The old blind man is the most regular patient. The novelty of\r\nbeing doctored or quacked by a Christian is wearing away. Wrote to-day to\r\nMr. Gagliuffi, British Vice-Consul of Mourzuk. Said, in visiting his\r\nfriends, for he has now _his circle_, brought me a present of\r\n_Danzagou_, in Arabic _Kashkash_. This is a seed of the size of a large\r\nhip, and of a beautiful scarlet colour; it is used sometimes as medicine,\r\nmostly for necklace beads, and is native of Soudan, where it abounds. He\r\nalso brought some _Morrashee_, in Arabic _Jidglan_. This is a species of\r\nmillet, a product of Soudan. The Blacks, Moors, and Arabs all eat it with\r\n_gusto_. There are several varieties of edible seed brought over The\r\nDesert from Soudan, chiefly as Saharan luxuries. Had a long conversation\r\nwith the people of the _Ben-Weleed_, and found them extremely sociable.\r\nOne of them had been to Leghorn, and described the houses as seven\r\nstories high, and the port _free_. These were his strongest impressions.\r\nIt is worth observing here the universal freemasonry of the mercantile\r\nspirit. As a merchant, he could understand and recollect a free-port in\r\nany part of the world. The honour of this anecdote have the Leaguers.\r\n\r\nA man showed me a sore place on his arm, which he called\r\n_Arak_[30]_-El-Abeed_ (‮عرك العبيد‬). This was a large raised\r\npimple, in the centre of which was an opening, and from which\r\naperture there issued from time to time a very fine worm, like the\r\nfinest silk-thread, and sometimes not much thicker than a spider's\r\nweb, in small detached lengths. This worm is often of the enormous\r\nlength of twenty yards, gradually oozing out piecemeal. It is a\r\ncommon disease of Soudan where the merchants catch the infection,\r\nand bring it over The Desert. It is said to be acquired principally\r\nby drinking the waters of that country.\r\n\r\nBy the wars before the occupation of the Turks, Tripoli had become\r\nexhausted of its wealth, and its trade and agriculture were at the lowest\r\nebb. The country was divided into two armed factions of the ancient\r\nfamily, money was borrowed at the most extravagant, and sometimes 500 per\r\ncent. interest, and the jewels of the ancient family were bartered away\r\nfor arms and provisions, to carry on the war. A large collection of\r\nsplendid diamonds were sold for something like an old song. Most of these\r\ngot into the hands of Europeans. I saw some in the hands of an European\r\ngentleman, who assured me that he had been fortunate enough to get them\r\nfor a fourth, and some of them for a seventh, of their value. When the\r\nTurks usurped the Government, such was the condition of the country. But\r\nthey had also to put down a formidable rebellion of the Arabs, which\r\noccupied several years of exterminating war. This gave the _coup de\r\ngrâce_ to the unfortunate Regency of Tripoli, and plunged it into\r\ncomplete ruin. There was, however, one city, far in The Desert, which\r\nappeared unaffected by these sanguinary and wasting revolutions--the\r\nholy-merchant-marabout city of Ghadames! the pacific character of whose\r\ninhabitants seemed to place it without the pale of such dire turmoils.\r\nBut the Turks (the war with the Arabs ended, and at leisure) began to\r\nlook about, and thought they saw an Eldorado looming beautifully in the\r\n_mirage_ of The Desert, which would speedily replenish their exhausted\r\ntreasures, and put the Government of Tripoli in easy pecuniary\r\ncircumstances. A pretext was soon found to excavate in this newly\r\ndiscovered Desert mine. \"The people of Ghadames,\" said the Pashas of\r\nTripoli, \"are rebels--they sympathized with the Arabs--they did not come\r\nforward to help us to exterminate the Arabs--they must now pay for their\r\ndisaffection.\" A forced contribution was therefore immediately levied\r\nupon them of 50,000 mahboubs and upwards, and the women and children were\r\nstripped of their gold and silver ornaments, and houses ransacked, to\r\nmake up the amount at once. Ten thousand mahboubs were also demanded\r\nannually. This new demand threw the city into consternation, and the men\r\nbrought out the women and the children into the streets, who fell upon\r\ntheir faces before the officers of the Pasha, and implored them not to\r\ndeprive their wives and children of bread. It was at last settled they\r\nshould pay 6,250 mahboubs, as an annual contribution. Under the Caramanly\r\ndynasty they paid only some 850 mahboubs per annum, besides being left to\r\nthe uncontrolled management of their own affairs. Now, whilst the people\r\nare complaining of the large amount of taxation imposed upon them, and\r\npleading their impossibility to pay up arrears--in this irritable state\r\nof things--an order comes from Ahmed Effendi in The Mountains, to collect\r\nan additional contribution of 3,225 mahboubs, under the pretext of its\r\nbeing wanted to maintain troops in Fezzan, and keep open the\r\ncommunications of commerce. This intelligence has so completely astounded\r\nthe few remaining merchants who have any money, that they nearly lost\r\ntheir senses, yesterday and to-day, being very ill, and unable to attend\r\nto their ordinary business. The money for the last four months is not\r\nyet collected, and the people say they cannot pay up. Our Rais has three\r\ntimes represented to the Pasha the inability of the people, but the\r\nanswer always is, \"_money must be had_.\" I expect to witness some cruel\r\nscenes of extortion practised before I leave this place, like what I saw\r\nin The Mountains. I observe now the Rais can't keep a respectable\r\ncollector. _No native of Ghadames will collect for him._ Sometimes he\r\nsends the Arab soldiers, who abuse the defaulters. Once an Arab soldier\r\ngot hold of a poor man in the street, an acquaintance of mine, to drag\r\nhim off before the Rais. I told him to stop a moment, and then having\r\nascertained how much it was--about one shilling and eight-pence--paid the\r\nmoney and got the poor fellow clear this time. Sheikh Makouran is a true\r\npatriot. Whenever he sees anybody dragged off in this way through the\r\nstreets, in spite of the Governor, and his being a member of the Divan,\r\nhe takes upon himself to impede the course of justice (_extortion?_),\r\nabuses with all his might the officer, and if he can't rescue the\r\ndefaulter, pays the money himself: so strives for public liberty this\r\nHampden of The Desert!\r\n\r\nTo-day, had a proof of the rancorous enmity of the ancient factions. A\r\nmerchant of the Ben Welleed, who wished to visit me, said, \"I must come\r\nround the city, for _I don't know_ the streets of the Ben Wezeet. Thank\r\nGod! I never went through them in my life.\" This he said with vehemence,\r\nintimating that he never would enter the streets of the Ben Wezeet as\r\nlong as he lived. A ghafalah has arrived from the oases of Fezzan,\r\nbringing corn and dates, productions abundant in those countries.\r\n\r\n_22nd._--Weather continues cool. Few more patients. Present of dates from\r\none of them. Very little meat now killed in Ghadames, less and less every\r\nday. What will become of this once flourishing city it is hard to tell.\r\nThe prejudices of the people against the residence of an European in this\r\ncity have apparently disappeared; people are increasingly civil; many\r\nwould willingly look upon me as their protector, were I made Consul, but\r\nunfortunately for them, I am not ambitious of, nor have any inclination\r\nfor, the honour.\r\n\r\nThis morning heard a curious opinion about Younas, or Jonas (Jonah), for\r\nthe Arabs, like the Greeks[31], sometimes change the last letter of the\r\nHebrew ה into a Σ. Probably they got their traditions through the Greeks\r\nor the Greek language. I was talking with a taleb about longevity, when\r\nhe observed, \"There is but one person who is always alive.\" \"Who is\r\nthat?\" I inquired very anxiously. \"It is our lord Jonas, who is living in\r\n_distant_ and _unknown_ parts of the world,\" he said. \"Is he alone?\" I\r\nfurther inquired. \"No,\" he added, \"he has with him a hundred thousand\r\npeople, who live to a great age, but who at last die, whilst he is always\r\nliving. Then as to Jesus, the son of Mary, he also never died, and went\r\nup to heaven alive. The Jews (the curse of God upon them!) only killed\r\nhis _likeness_.\" I have always observed these mysterious events to\r\ntranspire in some _unknown_ and _distant_ part of the world, and took the\r\nliberty of telling this taleb that the \"smoke-ships\" (steamers) could\r\nsoon make every place in the world near and known, and then we might find\r\nout the residence of Jonah as well as the captivity of the ten tribes.\r\nThe story of the ten tribes is pretty well known. A Maroquine rabbi told\r\nme they are somewhere about the regions of Gog and Magog, in Central\r\nAsia, situate in a country where there is a river running perpetually six\r\ndays out of seven, very rapid and full of stones, so that they cannot\r\npass it and return to the Holy Land. On the seventh it stops, when it\r\nmight be passed, but on the Sabbath day the law does not permit them to\r\ntravel. This is the Barbary version. Central Asia is still the land of\r\nmysteries for both Jews and Mohammedans. The Russians have done little to\r\ndispel these mysteries, if they have not tried to envelop these lands in\r\nprofounder obscurity, for political purposes; but had we been established\r\nin Affghanistan, we might have discovered _Jibel Kaf_, the retreat of Gog\r\nand Magog, the strange stony river, the ten tribes, and all the other\r\nobjects of Jewish and Mohammedan superstition. But as with the famous\r\ngardens of the Hesperides, the abode of perfectly happy mortals, which\r\nwere shifted farther and farther from actual observation by the progress\r\nof ancient discovery, so the mysterious retreat of the ten tribes and the\r\never-living Jonas will be transferred to other unknown lands when modern\r\ndiscovery shall have exhausted Central Asia.\r\n\r\nMet Sheikh Makouran: asked him what was to be done to meet the\r\nextraordinary contribution. He said he couldn't tell, people had no\r\nmoney: Rais had so written to Tripoli, but was reprimanded by the Pasha.\r\nAdvised him to send a deputation to the Pasha, or the British\r\nConsul-General. Had another example of the bad system of collecting\r\nmonies, as often in Mahometan States, by means of common soldiers. These\r\nfellows do all the dirty jobs, everything necessary in the way of\r\nextortion; the more respectable officials shun these disagreeable\r\ntransactions, especially if they be natives of the place where the taxes\r\nare collected. A great disturbance was in the streets, the people almost\r\nfighting with these extortioner ruffians. Going farther on, something\r\nabsolutely ludicrous happened. The soldiers could not read, no person\r\nwould read their papers for them, and they could not find out the person\r\non whom they were to make their demands, although the parties were\r\nactually present. They then came to me to read their papers. I asked\r\nthem, \"Whether they thought it showed any of the friendship which they\r\nprofessed towards me to embroil me with the people of the country, whose\r\nhospitality I was receiving?\" They were so convinced of the justice of my\r\nappeal, that they went off without replying. A Ghadamsee peasant called\r\nto me, \"Yâcob, you must be our Consul!\"\r\n\r\nAfternoon, Essnousee left for Ghat. Being extremely attached to this\r\nmerchant, I went to see him off. About thirty of the Ben Weleed (for he\r\nis of this faction) accompanied him, the most respectable of this\r\ndivision of the the city; I was glad to see a person, in whom hereafter I\r\nmight have to place implicit confidence, so much esteemed. His friends\r\nset to and loaded his camel before starting, as many as could find any\r\nthing, each taking an article of harness or equipment. This I observed\r\noften afterwards. It is reckoned friendly. By such conduct they show they\r\nare willing to render all the assistance in their power to their friend.\r\nI continued on the route of Ghat with Essnousee half an hour or more,\r\nbade him farewell and returned. His brothers and a slave left him with\r\nme. The merchant then proceeded on his desert journey of some fifteen or\r\ntwenty days _absolutely alone_, for he had only a Touarick camel-driver.\r\nThis demonstrates the security of the route. I said to the people\r\nafterwards, \"Is he not afraid to go alone?\" \"No,\" was the answer, \"they\r\nwill only meet Touaricks, and these are our friends. You have only to pay\r\na small trifle of toll in different parts of the route and you are quite\r\nsafe. Sometimes you don't pay this.\" Essnousee will reach Ghat in twelve,\r\nwhilst a quick caravan requires from eighteen to twenty days. With\r\nfirst-rate camels the journey could be performed in _eight_ or ten days.\r\nStrange infatuation! I felt an almost irrepressible desire to accompany\r\nEssnousee _as I was_, and to plunge anew into all the hardships and\r\ndangers of The Desert. But such is man, a creature of daring or absurd\r\nimpulses! and the more he moves, and roams, and rambles, the more (in\r\nmodern phrase) _locomotive_ he is--the less he likes repose, and seeks\r\nunceasingly such perilous stimulants. Observed, on returning, amongst the\r\nloose stones scattered upon the surface of The Desert, a great quantity\r\nof rubbish, like brick-bats thrown out from a brick-kiln, giving the face\r\nof the ground a burnt and volcanic appearance. Picked some up and could\r\nhardly believe but what they were burnt bricks. The Ben Weleed, who\r\naccompanied Essnousee, instead of the short and direct road through the\r\nstreets of the Ben Wezeet, took a circuitous route round the inner walls\r\nof the city to arrive at the gate of departure, showing me how great was\r\nstill the force of these factions. Essnousee himself told me he never\r\nwent through the streets of the Ben Wezeet, nor did he expect he ever\r\nshould in this world.\r\n\r\n_24th._--Yesterday and to-day employed in writing for the _Shantah_\r\n(Turkish, for mail). Rais in a good humour this evening. Two camels came\r\nin from The Sahara, one day's journey, laden with wood for the Rais. His\r\nExcellency offered some to me. The fact is, I purchased a camel-load a\r\nfew days ago, and his Excellency's servants had nearly begged it all\r\naway. People generally burn dried and dead branches of the palm, which,\r\nin this season, is abundant. It is not good fire-wood; there is plenty of\r\nflame and smoke, but little heat. Said, on my return from the Rais,\r\nassures me he has heard from his visitors, the Touarick slaves, that now\r\nthe Touaricks do not beat their slaves, but esteem all men _souwa,\r\nsouwa_, (\"equal\"); it was not so in former times. Free and enlightened\r\nAmerica may have yet to learn lessons of freedom and humanity from the\r\nsavages of The Sahara!\r\n\r\nPurchased a _Thob_[32], a species of large lizard. It is common in The\r\nSahara. The Touaricks eat them, and say they are _medicine_ for a pain or\r\nweakness in the back. This may have been surmised from the ideal\r\nresemblance between the strength of their backs, which is scaly and bony,\r\nand strongly bound together, and the strength it is likely to communicate\r\nunto persons having a weak or crippled spine. They are pretty good\r\neating, and taste something like the kid of the goat; the tail is\r\nesteemed the greatest delicacy. I tasted of this which I bought, and\r\nliked it. There is no lizard of this species in Soudan. A Touarick told\r\nme that, having found one in The Desert, he carried it to Soudan, where\r\na Negro prince fell in love with it, and gave him for it the present of a\r\nyoung female slave. The Arabs tame the Thob, and he grows very fond. Some\r\nof them are very large. This I purchased is only twenty inches in length,\r\nand about ten round the thickest part of the body. The head is large and\r\ntortoise-shaped, with a small mouth. It is covered with scales, or \"scaly\r\nmail,\" and its tail is about four inches long, composed of a series of\r\nbroad thick and sharp bones. It has four feet, or rather _hands_, for, as\r\nthe Arabs say, \"It has hands like _Ben-Adam_ (mankind).\" All the body,\r\nback and flanks, are covered by shining scales, of the colour of a\r\ndarked-spotted grey, with spots white and light under the belly. It runs\r\nvery awkwardly on account of its bulky tail, and to look at is a\r\nminiature aligator or crocodile. It is almost harmless, fighting a little\r\nnow and then; its appearance, however, is rather forbidding. It hides in\r\nthe dry sandy holes of The Sahara. A drop of water, say the Arabs, would\r\nhurt it. The traditions of the Mohammedans mention that Mahomet did not\r\nhimself eat the Thob, at the same time he did not prohibit it to his\r\nfollowers. The Saharan merchants, in traversing The Desert, frequently\r\nmake a good meal of the Thob. Whilst talking of the Thob, the people said\r\nthe flesh of parrots was _poison_ for Ben-Adam.\r\n\r\n_25th._--Another of my patients dead, of a raging fever caught, it is\r\nsaid, \"by sleeping on the top of the house in the open air.\" The moon\r\nstruck him, they say. According to the Psalms, \"The sun shall not smite\r\nthee by day, nor _the moon by night_.\"\r\n\r\nThey let him remain seven days without sending for me, when it was too\r\nlate to administer my fever powders. I fetched an old gentleman who could\r\nbleed to have him bled, but they refused, saying it was now late. The old\r\nblood-letter vexed at their refusal, said, \"Well, if I mustn't bleed him,\r\nlet me pray for him;\" and, immediately offered up a short prayer, in\r\nwhich they all joined willingly. On telling a Ghadamsee I ate some Thob,\r\nhe said, \"Ah, that's forbidden; the Thob was formerly a human being,\r\nbefore it had its present shape. Don't you see its hands are still\r\n_human_?\" The notion of the transmigration of souls lingers in these\r\nparts, but it is a doctrine not generally received. I observed this man\r\nafterwards fattening his sheep with date-stones, broken into small\r\npieces. Almost every family, however small, have their sheep to fatten.\r\nPounded date-stones are also given to camels for fattening. Writing for\r\namusement with my taleb, I recollected a verse in the Koran, which I\r\nwrote:--\r\n\r\n    ‮ارسلناك الّا رحمة للعلمين‬\r\n\r\nThis filled him with surprise and horror, and he immediately scratched it\r\nout, as too pure and holy a thing to be in the possession of an Infidel.\r\nThe translation is:--\"We (God) have sent thee (Mahomet) only for mercy to\r\nmankind;\" or, \"Thy mission to man, O Mahomet! is only mercy.\" Such credit\r\nall impostors and pretenders to revelation claim for themselves, and such\r\nan object they declare to be the end of their mission, although at the\r\nsame time, and in the same breath, they don't forget to doom all those\r\nwho reject their authority to perdition. This, it would seem, is a\r\nnecessary evil in propagating new religions and new sects. But enough of\r\nthis--may the world grow more kindly--let us hope it will. This morning\r\narrived a single Arab from Fezzan. It would appear extreme hardihood when\r\nwe reflect, that for nine days, there is not a house, and scarcely a\r\nresting-place. The Arab was mounted on a camel. This arrival, as\r\nEssnousee's departure, shows the security of the routes in some\r\ndirections. The Arab told me he made his journey in nine days, and\r\nstopped occasionally on the road to sleep and refresh himself. In the\r\nnight he tied his camel's leg to his own leg, so that if it attempted to\r\nstray, it would awake him.\r\n\r\nNothing new with Rais. Speaking of the Arabs, he says, \"You know Arabs to\r\nbe very devils. There are two ways to consider Arabs, but whichever way\r\nthey are robbers and assassins. When they are famished, they plunder in\r\norder to eat; when their bellies are full, they plunder because they kick\r\nand are insolent. Now, we (Turks) keep them upon low diet in The\r\nMountains; they have little, and always a little food. This is the\r\nSultan's _tareek_ (government) to manage them. Their spirits are kept\r\ndown and broken, and they are submissive.\" He then told me he had held a\r\nDivan to obtain the extra contribution of 3,200 mahboubs, for the Pasha;\r\nbut the people protested they could not pay such an amount. I wrote a\r\nletter to Colonel Warrington, stating this circumstance, and asked him if\r\nhe could assist the people in any way. I thought it a bare possibility\r\nthat the hand of foreign diplomacy might be stretched out to save this\r\ncity, which had flourished in the pursuits of its own peaceful commerce\r\nfor more than a thousand years. . . . To mitigate the apparent harshness\r\nof his demand, the Rais observed, that before the Sultan occupied\r\nGhadames, the country between this and Tripoli was full of banditti. \"The\r\nArabs of The Mountains,\" he added, \"were all banditti, those amongst whom\r\nyou resided eight days. The Touaricks were not so bad, they generally\r\nprotected Ghadamsee merchants. Now since the Sultan, there are only the\r\nShânbah and the Sebâah, therefore the Ghadamseeah must pay.\" So, _Audi\r\nalteram partem_.\r\n\r\n_26th._--To-day, resident thirty days in Ghadames which time I have\r\ncertainly not lost. Written a good deal of MS., such as it is, and\r\nseveral letters; besides, applied myself to reading and writing Arabic.\r\nLikewise distributed medicines to a considerable number of invalids. Wish\r\nto pass the next month as profitably as the month gone. My expenses of\r\nliving, including a guard to sleep in the house at night, and Said, are\r\nonly at the rate of eighteen-pence per day; this, however, excludes tea,\r\ncoffee, and sugar. Besides, Sheikh Makouran refuses to take anything for\r\nhouse-rent, saying, \"It would be against the will of God to receive money\r\nfrom you, who are our sure friend, and our guest of hospitality.\" Few\r\npatients, in comparison with the past. As the winter approaches, the\r\ncases of ophthalmia are less. In the precipitation of leaving Tripoli,\r\nbrought little ink with me, and most of that I gave away; so am obliged\r\nto go about the town to beg a little. The custom is, when one person\r\nwants ink, he begs it of another. Went to Ben Weleed, who procured me a\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nMy intercourse has been mostly with Ben Wezeet, but to day I visited _Ben\r\nWeleed_ at the _Bab-Es-Sagheer_, (\"the little gate,\") or the\r\n_Bab-Es-Saneeah_, (\"the gate of the garden,\") where there were about\r\nforty of the most respectable of this faction assembled in a sort of\r\ngossiping divan amongst themselves. They told me they met here every\r\nmorning, and chatted over the news of the previous day. Usually they meet\r\njust after sunrise, and certainly in this way they pass a cool and\r\nfragrant hour, full of the odoriferous breathings of the gardens as the\r\nday is awakening. I asked one, who were the richer, the Weleed or the\r\nWezeet? He replied, with an honourable frankness, \"The _Wezeet_.\"\r\nObserved many of the men had their eyelids blackened, like the women,\r\nwith _Kohel_[33], and also their finger-nails and toe-nails dyed dark-red\r\nwith henna[34]. I confessed I was surprised at this monstrous effeminacy.\r\nOne of these _lady_-gentlemen was the son of the powerful Ettanee family;\r\nhe was brought up to the Church, and of great promise, bidding fair to be\r\nfuture Kady or Archbishop. He put a curious question to me, \"How much is\r\nthe expense of a journey from Malta to Constantinople?\" When I satisfied\r\nhim, he said, \"I shall go and buy some slaves at Ghat, and then convey\r\nthem to Constantinople. Don't you think I shall make money by it?\" I told\r\nhim he would not find anybody at Malta to convey slaves to\r\nConstantinople; and if he took them there, they would be set at liberty,\r\nfor a slave once touching British territory became free. To this he\r\nreplied only, \"I know--I knew before.\" I was extremely glad he did know\r\nit. It is strange to see a young man of this description so avariciously\r\nturn himself into a slave-dealer, but Mohammedan priests frequently\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nMarabouts in The Mountains are mostly camel-drivers; and the greater part\r\nof priests, marabouts, and kadys perform sacred duties gratis. An order of\r\npriesthood exists, though it is not kept up very distinctly from laymen,\r\nbut it is an honour to them, \"to work in the service of God for nothing,\"\r\nand is worthy of the imitation of Christians. My new clerical friend gave\r\nme a dissertation upon things having two names, a classical one and a\r\nvulgar one. The Kohel is also called _Athmed_, ‮اثمد‬, which is\r\nits classical name. Senna is called _hasheeshah_, ‮حشيشه‬,\r\nliterally \"herbs,\" its vulgar name, and ‮سنا حرم‬,\r\n\"senna of _Mecca_,\" (literally, of the inviolable,) which is its\r\nclassical name. A little senna is found casually in the gardens of\r\nGhadames; but the country of Senna, in The Sahara, is Aheer, where\r\nit is cultivated by the Touaricks. He pointed out to me the _Tout_,\r\n(‮توت‬,) the small white mulberry, which is planted in little\r\nsquares of the city. Speaking of the Touaricks, he said: \"These\r\npeople are getting dissatisfied with us. Formerly we paid them\r\nbetter; but being robbed of our money by the Turks, we can't give\r\nthem much. They smell also a disagreeable odour now. Formerly they\r\ncame in and went out our city as a garden.\" \"What odour is that?\" I\r\nasked. \"_It's that Rais_,\" he whispered in my ear. The fact is, the\r\nTouaricks felt themselves more at home before the Turks came here,\r\nwhich everybody can imagine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, whilst talking with the people about their antiquities,\r\none of them said, \"There are some figures remaining.\" I immediately asked\r\nhim to show them to me. The youngster volunteered; and, to my great joy,\r\nI was taken off to a garden, where I saw the _bas-relief_ drawn above. I\r\nthen thought about getting it in a quiet way to my house; so I went up to\r\nthe owner of the garden in which it lay, and said to him in a very\r\ncareless, indifferent manner, \"What's the good of the stone to you--you\r\nmay give it me; perhaps it will be of some use.\" The man replied at once,\r\n\"Aye, Christian, take it.\" The youngster, who was a stout fellow, brought\r\nit off forthwith upon his head. I followed him in secret triumph,\r\nthinking myself very fortunate; for if any noise had been made, I should\r\nhave had to pay several dollars for it, whatever might have been its real\r\nvalue, and, perhaps, not have got it at all. Indeed, some of the people\r\nwere very jealous; and when I returned, they called out _flous! flous!_\r\n(\"money! money!\") They thought I had got a rich prize, and I hope I have.\r\nI told them, if anybody had any _flous_, it would be the owner of the\r\ngarden, who gave me the slab. The sketch represents, apparently, a\r\nsoldier holding or feeding a horse, but of what age and country I shall\r\nnot pretend to say, leaving that to antiquarians. It is broken off half,\r\nand otherwise pecked and mutilated by the people. It is a pious act of\r\nreligion to deface stones representing figures of any sort, to decapitate\r\nheads of statues, and destroy every shape and symbol of the human\r\nlikeness, not excepting likenesses of animals. An old Ghadamsee doctor,\r\nvery fond of me, was, however, extremely glad when he saw me in\r\npossession of the slab. He kept saying, \"Ah, Yâkob, that's your\r\ngrandfathers (ancestors). See! isn't it wonderful? Ah, that's your\r\ngrandfathers of the time of _Sidi Nimrod_. Take it home with you. Ah,\r\nthat's your grandfathers!\"\r\n\r\nThis evening, heard that the heads of the people of Ghadames had adopted\r\nmy suggestion of sending a deputation to Tripoli, to state their\r\ninability to meet the new and extraordinary demand of 3,200 mahboubs, the\r\nGovernor consenting to their determination.\r\n\r\n_27th._--Weather still cool and pleasant, but the flies are in great\r\nnumbers, and very disagreeable. Am obliged always to have my room\r\ndarkened when I write, to keep them from tormenting me. They\r\nincrease as the dates ripen, and soon after the dates are gathered\r\nin, they disappear, and not one is to be found during the winter. Haj\r\nMansour gave me to-day a _meneshsha_ (‮منشّا‬) or fly-flap, made\r\nof the long flowing beard of the Wadan. It is a most effective\r\nwhipper-away of the flies. It instantly disperses them, the fine\r\nstrong hair of the Wadan's beard hitting them like pins and needles.\r\nThis species of fly-flap is greatly valued in Soudan, where it sells\r\nat a high price. The hairs which are of a dull grey or red brown,\r\nare usually dyed with henna when made up into fly-flaps. I expressed\r\nmyself extremely obliged to the Haj. _Wadan_ (Ar. ‮ودان‬), _Oudad_\r\n(Berber ‮اوداد‬), and English _Mouflon_, is the name of a species\r\nof animals between the goat and the bullock[35]. It is common in the\r\nSouthern Atlas of Morocco, and is hunted in the neighbouring sands\r\nof Ghadames during winter by the Souf Arabs, and brought in and sold\r\nfor butcher's meat. Wadan is said to be _medicine_ by the people,\r\nand tastes like high flavoured coarse venison. Three or four only\r\nhave been sent to England[36]. Dr. Russell, in his _Barbary States_,\r\nmakes it to resemble a calf, but it rather resembles a large goat or\r\na horned sheep. Besides the _Wadan_ and the _Thob_, Saharan people\r\neat many animals which hungry Europeans might eat, amongst the rest\r\nrats and mice, when in good condition. But the mouse is the large\r\nmouse of The Sahara. The Rais had a live Wadan which died just\r\nbefore my arrival. He regretted much as he would have given it to\r\nme. His Excellency promises to get me one.\r\n\r\n_Nimrod_ is always in the mouths of the Ghadamseeah as the founder of\r\ntheir city. They are especially fond of calling him a _Christian_. He is\r\noften called my grandfather, although I have not yet been able to trace\r\nmy descent in a direct line from so august a progenitor. The European\r\nreader recollects where he is mentioned in the Jewish early records,--\r\n\r\n ‮הוּא הָיָה נִבּר֗־צַיִד לִפְנֵי־יְהוָה‬\r\n\r\n\"He was a mighty hunter before the Lord.\" Gen. x. 9. In the Arabic\r\ntranslation the word employed for \"mighty\" is the same as that of the\r\nHebrew, _i. e._ ‮جبّار‬ the ‮ج‬ representing the ‮ג‬,\r\nomitting any word to correspond with ‮ציד‬; but the Moors\r\nunderstand generally by the term ‮جبّار‬, \"a tyrant\" and \"a\r\nconqueror.\" So Hammoudah Bashaw, the great Bey of Tunis, is called\r\nby a faithful Tunisian historian of that country, a ‮جبّار‬.\r\nBut, perhaps, in those remote times, the hunter and the tyrant, as in the\r\nRoman Commodus, were joined in one and the same person. Certainly this\r\nis the natural sense of the combination of the terms ‮גבר־ציד‬.\r\nTo this might easily be added man-hunter and slave-maker, a worthy\r\nattribute of Nimrod. The gentlemen of the turf, of the Bentinck\r\nschool, ought, however to protest against this supposition. Properly\r\nNimrod is the Hercules of the Moors of North Africa. According to\r\nthem he emerged from the East, overran and founded several cities in\r\nThe Sahara, conquered all before him, put his feet upon the neck of\r\nall nations, and then passed the Straits of the Roman and Grecian\r\nHercules, and built the far-famed Andalous (Spain), as also Paris\r\nand London, and no doubt planted the germ of the future courses of\r\nEpsom and Ascot, of which he is in our day made the mighty patron\r\nand the ruling god[37].\r\n\r\nAfter Nimrod the people are very fond of talking about _Enoch_, who is\r\ncalled in the Koran _Edrees_ (‮ادريس‬). My taleb says that he did\r\nnot undergo the penalty of nature, but was translated, as, indeed,\r\nit is recorded of him in our sacred books. My taleb adds, \"Enoch was\r\na tailor, and one day the devil came to him and offered to sell him\r\nsome eggs, declaring that in the eggs the whole world was included.\r\nEnoch rejoined, '_Also in the eye of my needle is the whole world\r\ncomprehended_.' Immediately the eggs began to expand, and although\r\nreally empty, swelled out as wide as the arms when outstretched.\r\nEnoch seeing this was all imposition, to punish the impostor, sewed\r\nup one of the devil's eyes, who went off in a great rage. The needle\r\nof Enoch was nevertheless all powerful, and the devil has gone about\r\nwith _one eye_ ever since.\" My taleb asked me whether I ever heard\r\nof Noah. I opened the Arabic Bible and read some passages about the\r\nFlood. \"Yes,\" he said, \"Seedna (_our lord_) Noah was a carpenter\r\n(‮نجّار‬) because he built the ship (‮الفلك‬). I am also\r\na carpenter. I will show you my collection of tools. But I don't work\r\nnow at this trade, except for my amusement.\" The people know many of\r\nthe common trades which they exercise occasionally as amateurs.\r\n\r\nNothing puzzles the Touaricks and Negroes so much as my _gloves_. Am\r\nobliged to put them on and off frequently a dozen times a day, for their\r\nespecial gratification. My Leghorn hat, on the contrary, here, as in The\r\nMountains, is an object of admiration, on account of the fineness of the\r\nplatting. It astonishes them how it could be done. The large straw hats,\r\nwith huge broad brims, worn in The Desert, are all of the coarsest\r\ntexture.\r\n\r\nThis morning made inquiries of the Touaricks respecting serpents in\r\nThe Desert. Could obtain but little information, the notions of the\r\nSaharan tribes in general being very confused about serpents. All\r\nserpents go under the name of _lefâah_ (‮لفعة‬). But other names\r\nare in use here, as ‮حنش‬, ‮حية‬ &c., which apparently are\r\nthe generic names. The _boah_ mentioned by Dr. Russell I have not\r\nheard of. One of the Touaricks, however, described to me a serpent\r\nas being nearly as thick round as a man's body, but not more than\r\nthree feet in its greatest length. This serpent has also large\r\nhorns. It is not at all dangerous. There is a much longer serpent or\r\nsnake, but not more than four inches round in thickness, which is\r\ndangerous. If we are to believe Mr. Jackson, the southern part of\r\nMorocco abounds with monstrous serpents, but in all my route through\r\nThe Sahara, I met with none, nor heard of any. It is a very old\r\ntrick of the poets and retailers of the marvellous to people The\r\nDesert with dragons, and serpents, and monsters of every kind. We\r\nknow that on the banks of the _Majerdah_ an enormous serpent stopped\r\nthe progress of the army of Regulus. Batouta, also, who flourished\r\nin the fourteenth century, pretends that \"The Desert is full of\r\nserpents.\" Even Caillié, who saw neither lions nor elephants, or\r\nvery few animals of any sort, says, when at the wells of\r\n_Amoul-Gragim_, \"My rest was disturbed by the appearance of a\r\nserpent, five feet and a-half long and as thick as the thigh of a\r\nboy twelve years old. My travelling companions also experienced\r\nsimilar visits.\" If this report be correct, it evidently refers to\r\nthe harmless _lefâah_ mentioned by the Touarick. At the ruins of\r\nLebida, on the coast of Tripoli, an unusual number of large snakes\r\nwere seen this year (1845), mounting upon and twining round the\r\nbroken shafts of pillars still standing, as if at the command of\r\nsome invisible _jinn_; but they were all perfectly harmless. The\r\njugglers were catching them, to exhibit their forky tongues and\r\nsnaky folds, as venomous and deadly, to the marvel-loving crowd. The\r\nlion of The Desert is a myth. The king of beasts never leaves his\r\nrich domain, the thick forest and pouring cascade, where water and\r\nanimals of prey abound, for the naked, arid, sandy, and rocky wastes\r\nof The Sahara. The ancients and moderns, however, have persisted in\r\nrepresenting Africa, not only as a country full of monsters, but\r\n\"_always producing some new monster_,--\"\r\n\r\n    Semper aliquid novi Africam afferre[38],\r\n\r\nall which is either entirely incorrect or a monstrous exaggeration. It\r\nwould have been very _nice_ to fight one's way through The Desert in the\r\nmidst of every kind of beast and monster which the gloomy imagination of\r\nmen may have conjured up from the beginning of the annals of adventure\r\nand travel; this would have made these pages undoubtedly very \"stirring\r\nand exciting.\" Happily Providence has not filled up those vast spaces\r\nwhich separate Northern and Central Africa with such hideous tenants!\r\nSufficient are the evils of The Desert to the wayfarer who sojourns\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, had a long conversation with a group of people. The\r\nsubjects, in which they all felt more than ordinary curiosity, were, the\r\nnew world of America, Australia, the Pacific, and the whales in it, and\r\nthe gold and silver mines of South America, &c. The number of sheep,\r\nalso, in Australia, amazed them, in comparison with the few wandering\r\nscattered flocks in The Desert. I am become a walking gazette amongst\r\nthe people, and ought to be dubbed \"Geographer of The Desert.\" They also\r\nquestion me on the relative forces of the Christian Powers, and have a\r\ngreat idea of the military strength of France. The capture of Algiers has\r\nproduced a vivid and lasting impression of the French power throughout\r\nall North Africa. They consider England the great power on the sea, and\r\nFrance on the land. I have, besides, to tell them of the population of\r\nall the world, and to answer a thousand other questions. Sometimes their\r\nconversation, after being exceedingly animated, falls into unbroken and\r\nmoody silence, and they recline for hours, without moving a muscle of the\r\nface or uttering a syllable. Indolence is the besetting sin of the\r\nSaharan tribes. It is also the same in Tripoli. Col. Warrington, in\r\nreporting upon the Tripolines, says:--\"Whether the extraordinary\r\nindolence of the people proceeds from the climate, or want of occupation,\r\nI know not, but they are in an horizontal position twenty hours out of\r\nthe twenty-four, sleeping in the open air.\" In this temperate season of\r\nthe year, the Ghadamsees might find useful and healthful occupation in\r\nthe gardens, but they are so confoundedly lazy that they won't stir, and\r\nwhat work really is done is performed by slaves. Such people deserve to\r\nstarve. Caillié says:--\"The Mandingoes would rather go without food part\r\nof the day than work in the fields; they pretend that labour would take\r\noff their attention to the Koran, which is a very specious excuse for\r\nlaziness.\" Like most people in Central Africa, all their hard work is\r\ndone by the poor slaves. The Ghadamsee people have, however, the excuse\r\nthat, being a city of merchants, their object is repose when they return\r\nfrom long journeys.\r\n\r\nPaid a visit to Rais; presented to his Excellency one of my best razors,\r\nwith which he was highly delighted. Saw plenty of my acquaintances, all\r\npleased with the Ramadan being about to terminate. Few patients.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] The Arabic ‮عرك‬ seems to be used for a pustule or small\r\n    tumour. The term is applied to the tumour of a camel. There is\r\n    also the term ‮عرق‬, \"decayed flesh or bone.\"\r\n\r\n[31] ‮يونس‬, Ἰωνας. _Esaias_ is changed in the same way.\r\n\r\n[32] ‮الضب‬, _Thob_--monitor: probably, _monitor pulchra_.\r\n\r\n[33] ‮كحل‬, _Kohel_, \"powder of lead,\" name derived from the\r\n    epithet \"_black_.\"\r\n\r\n[34] ‮حنّا‬, _Henna_, \"Lawsonia alba,\" Law. The Henna shrub is\r\n    cultivated in irrigated fields at Ghabs (Tunis), and is a source\r\n    of wealth.\r\n\r\n[35] It is the _Ovis Tragelaphus_ of Zoologists.\r\n\r\n[36] I was fellow-passenger from Mogador with the male oudad, now\r\n    at the Royal Zoological Gardens. He is a very fine animal, but has\r\n    but one eye.\r\n\r\n[37] The foundation of Nimrod's reputation was laid in the East,\r\n    many curious facts of which have been preserved in Armenian\r\n    tradition. The Armenian Bishop, Dr. Nerses Lazar, says, for the\r\n    benefit of all England, (See his _Scriptural and Analogical\r\n    Conversations on the Physical and Moral World with reference to an\r\n    Universal Commercial Harmony_, published by Bentley, London,\r\n    1846):--\"In the second age of the world, just on entering the\r\n    second century, _Nimrod began to be a mighty one in the earth_; he\r\n    was the first great warrior, conqueror, or most severe governor.\r\n    _He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said,\r\n    Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord_, by which means\r\n    he became a mighty monarch. For he inured himself to labour by\r\n    this toilsome exercise, and got together a great company of young\r\n    robust men to attend him in this sport; _who were hereby also\r\n    fitted to pursue men as they had done wild beasts_. (Here the Free\r\n    Kirk will find the beginning of the system which they are\r\n    patronizing in Yankee Land.) Besides, in the age of Nimrod, the\r\n    exercise of hunting might win him the hearts of men, whom he thus\r\n    delivered from wild beasts, to which they were much exposed in\r\n    their rude and unprotected way of living; so that many at last\r\n    joined him in the great designs he formed of subduing men, and\r\n    making himself master of the neighbouring people in Babylon,\r\n    Susiana, and Assyria. The memory of this hunting of his was\r\n    preserved by the Assyrians, who made Nimrod the same as Orion, for\r\n    they joined the dog and the hare, the first creature perhaps that\r\n    he hunted, with his constellation. He first erected Babylon, and\r\n    Assyria is called the land of Nimrod, &c., &c. He began to exalt\r\n    himself, and he is called _Bel_ from his dominions, and _Nimrod_\r\n    from his rebellion (against God).\" The worthy prelate goes on\r\n    giving a very long affair about the father of huntsmen and\r\n    jockies. Nimrod has come up again in this our year of 1847. The\r\n    French and English antiquarians and excavators have dug him up,\r\n    and all his splendid posterity from the banks of the Euphrates at\r\n    the _Bir-el-Nimroud_. The _Royal Asiatic Society_ no doubt will\r\n    soon find his mark, or cross, His Turfy Highness not being\r\n    expected to be a _letterato_, in Cuneiform, wedge-shaped or\r\n    arrow-headed characters upon the unbaked or sun-dried bricks\r\n    thrown out of the famous Nineveh mound, so that at last Nimroud\r\n    will have full justice done him by a grateful posterity.\r\n\r\n[38] Pliny. This vulgar error of antiquity is cited\r\n     from the Greek of Aristotle.\r\n     Λεγεται δε τις παροιμα ὁτι αει τι Λιβυη καινον.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFAST OF THE RAMADAN.\r\n\r\n     The Shâanbah and Banditti of The Desert.--Native Plays and Dances\r\n     of Ghadamsee Slaves.--Aâween, or Square of Springs.--The Women of\r\n     Ghadames, their Habits and Education.--The Ghadamsee and Berber,\r\n     or Numidian Languages.--Varieties of People and Population of\r\n     Ghadames.--Charge of corrupting the Scriptures.--Ben Mousa\r\n     Ettanee.--The Bishop of Gibraltar.--Continue teaching\r\n     Geography.--Ruin of the Country.--Approaching end of the\r\n     World.--Seeing the New Moon.--My Taleb disputes about\r\n     Religion.--Movements of Banditti.--The small Force by which the\r\n     Turks hold Tripoli.\r\n\r\n\r\n_28th._--HEARD the _Shâanbah_--‮شعانبة‬--and Touaricks are about\r\nto have a set-to. Last year they had a skirmish, and the Touaricks\r\nkilled about eighty of the Shâanbah. These latter are going to\r\navenge their defeat; they will attack the open districts, and then\r\nproceed to Ghat. The Shâanbah inhabit a desert of sand in the\r\nneighbourhood of Warklah--‮وارقلة‬--about fifteen days from\r\nGhadames, and four from Souf. They are independent tribes, but small\r\nin number, not more than from five to six hundred. Nominally,\r\nhowever, they are located in French Algerian territory. They have\r\nbeen celebrated from time immemorial as the robbers and assassins of\r\nThe Desert--_to be a brigand_ is, with them, an hereditary\r\nhonour--and they are equally the dread of the people of Warklah,\r\nwhose neighbours they are, as of stranger merchants and caravans.\r\nThey have a well of water scooped out in the sandy regions where\r\ntheir tents are pitched, and here they live in a horrid security,\r\ndefying all law and authority, human and divine, and all the\r\nneighbouring Powers. Around them is an immensity of sandy wastes,\r\nand none dare pursue them to their abhorred dens. Horses, indeed,\r\nwould be useless; and camels might wander for months without water,\r\nand perish before coming upon their hiding places in these dreadful\r\nregions. \"Two hundred men would require four hundred camels, eight\r\nhundred water-skins, and provisions for two months,\" says the Rais,\r\n\"and therefore we must leave them to be exterminated by time.\"\r\nUnfortunately, they are recruited from the bad characters of the\r\nSouafah, a kindred tribe of Arabs, and other outlaws. The Shâanbah\r\nare the great professional bandits of the North, but there are some\r\nother fragmentary tribes, located on the confines of The Sahara, and\r\nthe valleys of the Atlas. Particularly I may mention the horde of\r\nbrigands of Wady-es-Sour, which infest the routes between Touat and\r\nTafilelt. But this horde is more placable, and mostly, after levying\r\nblack-mail, will allow a caravan to pass uninterruptedly on its way.\r\nThe expedition of the Shâanbah will take place after Ramadan, for,\r\nlike the story of the Spanish assassins, who, being too early to\r\nenter the house of an unfortunate victim, went in the meanwhile to\r\nthe matins which were being celebrated in a neighbouring church, so\r\nthese pious assassins of The Desert highways will not proceed to\r\ntheir work of blood and slaughter until the fast of Ramadan is\r\nconcluded. The Shâanbah and Touaricks are, besides, national enemies\r\nas to blood, the former being pure Arab, and the latter of the\r\nBerber, or aboriginal stock of North Africa. The Shâanbah have for\r\narms common matchlocks, and a few horses in addition to their\r\ncamels. The Touaricks have the spear, dagger, the straight broad\r\nsword, and a few matchlocks and pistols, it is said, and all are\r\nmounted on camels, so the contest is somewhat differently balanced\r\nwith regard to the mode of equipment. People speculate as to the\r\nsuccess of the parties, but their sympathies are entirely with the\r\nTouaricks.\r\n\r\nSaid comes in blubbering, sympathizing with his countrymen, saying,\r\nRais has been bastinadoing his household slaves, natives of Bornou\r\nlike himself. Rais certainly ought not to do this, for he does not\r\nbastinade his Moors or Arab servants. In the evening I went with\r\nSaid to see the slaves of Ghadames indulge in their native dances and\r\nother plays. These are called ‮لعب العبيل‬ \"_playing of the\r\nslaves_.\" The festival of the evening was \"_the night of power_\"\r\n(‮ليلة القدر‬), on which the Koran[39] descended from heaven,\r\nand the slaves were allowed a holiday in consideration of this\r\nsolemnity. The slaves danced in a circle around a leader of the\r\ndance in the centre. At first, it is a simple walking round, face to\r\nback, the legs raised, and a little swinging, and the steps keeping\r\ntime to the iron castanets fastened on the hands of each. Meanwhile,\r\nthey sing, and the chorus comes at intervals between the noise of\r\ncastanets, or finger-clappers. They now turn round and face their\r\nleader, some prostrating before him, and others twirling themselves\r\nround, but always moving in their circular motion and singing. The\r\ntones of their voice are melodious and deep, not the plaintive\r\nwearying monotony of the Arabs. Now the sounds increase, the chorus\r\nrises higher and higher, the steps fall heavy, like the tread of\r\nmilitary, on the ground; and now, sounds, steps, and every noise and\r\nmovement quickens, until it becomes a frantic rush around their\r\nterrified leader, who is at last, as the finish of the dance,\r\noverthrown in the wild tumult. . . . . . . Besides the castanets,\r\nthey have a rude drum, consisting of a piece of skin stretched over\r\nthe mouth of a large calabash, brought from Soudan, which makes a\r\nlow hollow sound: to these is added occasionally a rude squeaking\r\nhautboy. This circular dance was performed by about thirty male\r\nslaves, gaily dressed in their best clothes, and evidently all very\r\nhappy, in truth, the free blood of their native homes danced through\r\ntheir veins. Aye, the poor slave danced and sung! happier far than\r\nhis proud and wealthy master, who looked on in moody silence. So God\r\nhas ordained it to alleviate and balance human miseries. This dance\r\nof freedom lasted a full hour, and was very laborious. There were\r\nseveral Negresses near, who answered in shrill voices to the deep\r\nchoruses of the Negroes, but did not themselves dance. After the\r\ncircular dance, came off reels of couples. These were danced with\r\ngreat spirit, nay, violence: there was no dancing of a person\r\nsingly. None of the dancing was indecent, like the Moorish; the\r\nlower part of the body and legs now and then assumed steps and\r\npositions like the well known Spanish _fandango_ with castanets.\r\n\r\n_29th._--Weather is now tolerably cool all day long in the city, but\r\nnot cool enough for agreeable travelling. Sketched to-day the\r\n_Aâween_, ‮اعوين‬, or square of \"fountains,\" which belongs to the\r\nfaction of the Ben Weleed. A group of fifty persons surrounded me,\r\nall clamoring to see what I was doing, and making the funniest\r\nobservations. They call drawing, _writing_ a thing. One said, \"Ah,\r\nit is well written, the Christians know everything but God.\"\r\nAnother, \"Yâkob, shall you give that writing to your Sultan?\" From\r\nthe fountains in this square, which merely run into stone troughs,\r\nthe camels drink.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe white women, or the respectable women of Ghadames, white or coloured,\r\nnever descend to the streets, nor even go into the gardens around their\r\nhouses. Their flat-roofed house is their eternal promenade, and their\r\nwhole world is comprehended within two or three miserable rooms. The\r\ndate-palms they see, and a few glimpses of The Desert beyond--and this is\r\nall. Truly it is necessary to establish an Anti-Slavery Society for the\r\nwomen of this oasis. I have visited a few of them in their private\r\napartments with their husbands, in my capacity of quack-doctor. None of\r\nthem were fair or beautiful, but some pleasing in their manners, and of\r\nelegant shape; they are brunettes, one and all, with occasionally large\r\nrolling, if not fiery, black eyes. They are gentle in their manners, and\r\nwere very friendly to The Christian. Many of them, in spite of their\r\nseclusion, shewed extreme intelligence; they are also very industrious.\r\nMy taleb assured me the little money he got from keeping the register of\r\nthe distribution of water, and other minor matters, could not keep his\r\nfamily, and his chief support was from the industry of his wife in\r\nweaving, whom he highly praised, adding, \"God has given me the best wife\r\nin Ghadames.\" Most of the women weave woollens enough for the consumption\r\nof their family, and some for sale abroad. The education of women\r\nconsists in learning by heart certain prayers, portions of the Koran, and\r\nlegendary traditions of the famous _Sunnat_. The women are proud of their\r\nlearning, and the men pride themselves in saying, \"Only in this country\r\nare women so well instructed!\" Besides this, they have the privilege of\r\ngoing to the mosques very early in the morning, and late in the evening,\r\nwhere they say their prayers like men, at least, so I understood from my\r\ntaleb; but a Christian must not ask questions about women in these\r\ncountries. The same authority assured me, the women, mostly negresses and\r\nhalf-castes, seen in the streets in the day-time, are slaves, or esteemed\r\nas such, the Touarick women excepted. I have no doubt the manners of the\r\nwomen of this city are generally very correct, and as chaste as any women\r\nin North Africa. But the Touarick women, especially of the elder sort,\r\nare not always exceedingly refined. One morning, going out from my\r\nhouse, I found some seven or eight Touarick women sitting on the\r\nstone-bench at the door. They began to laugh and joke with me; at last\r\none of the elder present said, \"Now, Christian, give me some money, and\r\nthen I'll come into your house.\" At this delicate sally, all expressed\r\ntheir approbation in loud laughter: the half-caste women are much the\r\nsame. A Moor said something to me, which I did not understand, and then\r\nlaughed and said, \"It is a Negro word,\" and, lest I should want an\r\ninterpreter, an half-caste lady present, putting her hand deliberately to\r\nsomething, said, \"That's the meaning,\" repeating the action two or three\r\ntimes. On the whole, however, I have not seen so many cases of indelicacy\r\nin this part of the world, as are to be seen almost every day in Paris\r\nand London. No, the morals of The Desert are mostly pure and continent as\r\ncompared to those of our great European cities.\r\n\r\nMy taleb to-day made a vocabulary of the Touarghee, Ghadamsee, and Arabic\r\nlanguages. He finished also the translation of the third chapter of\r\nMatthew into the Ghadamsee language, which I sent afterwards to the\r\nBritish and Foreign Bible Society. I did not expect that he would have\r\ndone it so easily, thinking his religious scruples would have interfered.\r\nHe would have done all the Gospels had I paid him. According to Ben\r\nMousa, the Ghadamsee language contains a few Arabic words, and is a most\r\nancient dialect. It is spoken only at Siwah and Ougelah, two Tripoline\r\noases near the coast, ten days apart, on the route to Egypt, and there is\r\na dialect something like it in one of the Tunisian mountains. Many of the\r\nTouarghee words, he says also, are very much like, if not the same, as\r\nthose of Ghadamsee. I showed him the Gospel of St. Luke, translated into\r\nthe Berber language of Algeria, through Mr. Hodgson, and published by the\r\nBible Society. He was only able to recognize a few Ghadamsee words in\r\nthis translation. The Berber dialects, which comprehend the Ghadamsee,\r\nthe Touarghee, the Kabylee, the Shouweeah (of Dr. Shaw), and the Shelouk\r\nof Morocco, although more or less intimately related, are very dissimilar\r\nin many words and expressions. But they are sister branches of one\r\noriginal mother, which require to be reduced to consistency and harmony\r\nby some mastermind, and then a very copious and powerful language might\r\nbe formed. Such is said to have been the state of the German language\r\nwhen Luther made his translation of the Scriptures, by which he laid the\r\nfoundation of the present mighty language of the Germans. Their common\r\nenemy is the Arabic, which is daily making inroads upon them; and the\r\nprobability is, instead of being moulded into one mighty whole, they will\r\nin the course of a few centuries be destroyed by the language of their\r\nreligion, for which the Berber tribes have a superstitious reverence.\r\nThere is a singularity about the language of Ghadames: it has differences\r\nas spoken by the two factions of the Weleed and the Wezeet, the\r\nprovincialisms of the country. It is highly probable that the various\r\nBerber dialects are the fragments of the language of those formidable,\r\nbut doubtful, auxiliaries, which so often balanced and changed the\r\nfortune of Roman and Carthaginian arms. Of all these Numidian dialects,\r\nonly one people has amongst them a native alphabet, the rest using Arabic\r\ncharacters: this people are the Touaricks. It is besides worthy of\r\nremark, that amongst all the African tribes of Central Africa, nay, every\r\npart of Africa, excepting the Coptic and Abyssinian Christians, only one\r\nalphabet has been found, none of the other tribes having any characters\r\nwherewith to write. Specimens of the Touarghee and Ghadamsee language, as\r\nwell as this alphabet, have been recently published, under the auspices\r\nof the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nThe language of Ghadames is spoken by an extremely mixed and various\r\npopulation. Some are from Arabs of the plains, others from Arabs of the\r\nmountains, others from Berber tribes, others from Moors of the Coast, and\r\nnot a few from Negress mothers, of every description of Negro race found\r\nin the interior. Sometimes the men make a boast of being descended from\r\nancestors of pure Arab blood, from immigrants of the princes of Mecca and\r\ncountries thereabouts in Arabia, but in practice they contemn the\r\nprinciple of uncontaminated blood, cohabiting with their favourite female\r\nslaves, and from these rearing up a large family of mixed blood and\r\ncolour. In the Arab suburb a considerable number of free Negroes, the\r\noffspring of liberated slaves, are settled. This class of population has\r\nbeen mistaken for emigration from the interior, by some writers; but\r\nNegroes never emigrate from the south to the north over The Desert,\r\nhowever, some may wander, like the Mandingoes, in the countries of\r\nWestern Africa, as itinerant traders, tinkers, and pedlars. The city of\r\nGhadames presents therefore a most mixed and coloured population, there\r\nbeing but very few of pure Arab blood, and fewer still of fair\r\ncomplexions. I have seen, nevertheless, some families of sandy hair and\r\nfair skins; but, certainly, the _barbarossa_ (\"red beard,\") or flaxen\r\nlocks, are not esteemed. These children of the sun prefer the raven-black\r\nbeard, the tanned skin, and the gazelle eye. The united population\r\namounts to about 3,000, but there are many Ghadamsee families established\r\nin Soudan and Timbuctoo. I may add, six languages are spoken daily in\r\nGhadames, viz., Ghadamsee, Arabic, Touarghee, Housa, Bornouse, and\r\nTimbuctoo. The Rais has not a Turkish soldier or servant with him, or\r\nTurkish would make seven. Mourzuk being a garrison town, there Turkish,\r\nGreek, Italian, and Tibbo may be added to these six languages. The Negro\r\nlanguages are spoken by the slaves and free Negroes, and the merchants in\r\nconversing with them.\r\n\r\nAs a specimen of flying reports, I heard yesterday Bona was not in the\r\nhands of the French, but the Mussulmans. With respect to _shamatah_\r\n(\"fighting\"), the reports added, the French had lost 100,000 men in\r\nbattle! The eyes of all genuine Moslems are turned anxiously westwards,\r\nand force and conquest, is everything with them.\r\n\r\n_30th._--The mornings are now very cool and delicious. Walked on my\r\nterrace, and enjoyed the fresh air of this autumnal spring. The palms are\r\nbeautiful to look upon, and the Desert city has the aspect of an\r\nHesperides. Are these the \"fortunate isles\" of the ancients? A few birds\r\ntwittering and chirping about, pecking the ripe dates.\r\n\r\nMy taleb, backed with two or three Mussulman doctors, charged me in\r\nthe public streets with corrupting and falsifying the text of the\r\nword of God. \"This,\" he said, \"I have found by looking over your\r\n‮الانجيل‬ Elengeel (Gospel).\" It is precisely the charge which\r\nwe make against the Mohammedans. But our charge is not so much\r\ncorrupting one particular revelation as falsifying the entire books\r\nof the Jews and the Christians, of giving them new forms, and adding\r\nto them a great number of old Arabian fables. A taleb opened the\r\nTestament at the Gospel of St. Mark, and read, _that Jesus was the\r\nSon of God_. Confounded and vexed at this, he said, \"_God neither\r\nbegets nor is begotten_,\" (a verse of the Koran). An Arab from the\r\nTripoline mountains turned upon me and said, \"What! do you know\r\nGod?\" I answered sharply, \"Yes; do you think the knowledge of God is\r\nconfined to you alone?\" The bystanders applauded the answer.\r\n\r\nIn general, the ignorant of the population of this part of North Africa,\r\nas well as Southern Morocco and Wadnoun, think the Christians are not\r\nacquainted with God, something in the same way as I heard when at Madrid,\r\nthat Spaniards occasionally asked, if there were Christians and churches\r\nin England: \"Hay los Cristianios, hay las iglesias in Inglaterra?\" But in\r\nother parts of Barbary, I have found, on the contrary, an opinion very\r\nprevalent, that the religion of the English is very much like the\r\nreligion of the Moors, arising, I have no doubt, from the absence of\r\nimages and pictures in Protestant churches.\r\n\r\nThis evening, when visiting the Ben Weleed, conversation turned upon the\r\nBas-Relief. The people showed some jealousy at my possessing it, and\r\nwould have prefered that it remained in the oasis, and were not sent to\r\nTripoli. They added:--\"Because it proves that God has given us the land\r\nof the Christians.\" This is the grand argument in proof of the\r\nMussulman's religion, that God has given him the countries of the\r\nInfidels. Indeed, the sooner the Bas-Relief is off the better. On my\r\nobserving that the slab belonged to a date prior to the Christians, they\r\nwere astonished, and asked, \"_Who were before the Christians?_\" They have\r\nno idea of people before the Christians. The conversation was suddenly\r\nstopped by the appearance of a remarkable personage, the _quasi_-Sultan\r\nof the Ben Weleed. This was the famous rich and powerful Haj Ben Mousa\r\nEttanee. He is a man of a great age, and nearly blind, and the chief of\r\nthe most numerous and influential family of Ghadames. He always exhibits\r\na most difficult and obstinate temper in public affairs, and, I\r\nunderstand, from the first, has shown an hostility to my residence in\r\nGhadames, unlike the Sheikh Makouran, who is the recognized Chief of the\r\nBen Wezeet, and who has shown himself as favourable as the other Chief\r\nhostile. There may be a little of the spirit of faction in this; for we\r\nsee often a person unsupported by the one party, because he is supported\r\nby the other party. But the whole family of Ettanee is considered _wâr_\r\n(\"difficult\"). The Rais speaking to me of this family, said: \"Wâr, wâr--I\r\ncan do nothing with the Ettanee.\" Ettanee was attended by two or three\r\nservants, one carrying a skin, and another a cushion to recline on\r\n(_mokhaddah_). These arranged, the old gentleman mounted upon the\r\nstone-bench and took his seat, everybody making way for him with the\r\ngreatest alacrity. Having heard I was present, after a short silence, he\r\naddressed me: \"Christian, do you know Scinde[40]?\" I replied, \"I know\r\nit.\" \"Are not the English there?\" he continued. \"Yes,\" I said. He then\r\nturned and said something to the people in the Ghadamsee language[41]. My\r\nconversation with them was always in Arabic. He abruptly turned to me,\r\n\"Why do the English go there, and eat up all the Mussulmans? Afterwards\r\nyou will come here.\" I replied, \"The Ameers were foolish, and engaged in\r\na conspiracy against the English of India; but the Mussulmans in Scinde\r\nenjoyed the same rights and privileges as the English themselves.\"\r\n\"That's what you say,\" he rejoined, and then continued: \"Why do you go so\r\nfar from home, to take other people's countries from them?\" I replied,\r\n\"The Turks do the same; they came here in The Desert.\" \"Ah! you wish to\r\nbe such oppressors as the Turks,\" he continued very bitterly, and then\r\ntold me not to talk any more. No one present dared to put in a word. This\r\npainful silence continued for some time. I was anxious to get off,\r\nfeeling very disagreeable; and beginning to move, he said to somebody,\r\n\"_Who's_ that?\" for he couldn't see much, being nearly blind. They told\r\nhim it was the Christian going. He cried out, \"Stop!\" and then added,\r\n\"You have books with you, but you English are not Christians. You deceive\r\nus. Nor are the Danish, or the Swedes, or the Russians Christians. _They\r\nhave no books._\" He meant _religious_ books. The same opinion, I found\r\nafterwards, was entertained by Haj Ibrahim, a very respectable and\r\nintelligent Moorish merchant of Tripoli. Haj Ibrahim said to me, \"How is\r\nit that you have books on religion, when the English have none?\"\r\nFormerly Ettanee resided at Tripoli; and I have not the least doubt both\r\nthese Moors derived this false information from the intolerant and\r\nProtestant-hating Romanist priests resident in Tripoli, backed as the\r\nfalsehoods were by the absence of any English church or worship, although\r\nthe English Consul very regularly celebrated worship in his family every\r\nSunday,--a circumstance which ought to have been known amongst the town\r\npopulation of all religions. I am sorry the intentions of the British\r\nGovernment have been so feebly carried out by the Bishop of Gibraltar.\r\nHer Majesty's Government was anxious that Dr. Tomlinson should visit all\r\nthe coasts of the Mediterranean, both to strengthen the few Protestants\r\nscattered on these inhospitable shores, and to show the various\r\nauthorities and people of this famed inland sea, that the English had a\r\nreligion, and cared for its prosperity. Up to the time I left the Barbary\r\ncoast, Dr. Tomlinson had neither visited Tunis nor Tripoli, though he had\r\nbeen resident at Malta some three years. This is too bad; and it is quite\r\nclear the Bishop does not understand the object of his mission in the\r\nMediterranean. He ought to have shown himself at once in all Barbary; he\r\nthen might have annihilated this monstrous error, propagated by Romish\r\npriests, that the English had no religious books, and were not\r\nChristians. It is but justice to add, the Bishop went to Tangiers. Mr.\r\nHay expected a very unctuous episcopal visit, and was shocked to hear the\r\ngood Bishop talk so much about fortifications and \"horrid war.\" There is\r\nconsistency in everything; and common sense dictated that the Bishop\r\nshould have, on such a visit, assumed his character of \"Overseer of the\r\nscattered Protestant flock.\" Unfortunately, when he went first to Malta,\r\nDr. Tomlinson acted more like an episcopalian tight-rope dancer, always\r\nbalancing himself between Puseyism and Evangelicalism, and so distracted\r\nthe few Protestants at Malta. He is eminently a man of no decision of\r\ncharacter; and whenever he does manage to get up his reluctant will to a\r\ndecision, it is invariably on the wrong side of the question. Here in The\r\nDesert I found myself pestered with both political and religious\r\nquestions; and to have shirked either, would have been to offend the\r\npeople. There was no alternative but to preach to them that all the\r\nEnglish and all Protestants had the same Bible as the Romanists, and were\r\nequally Christians with them. I may add, of the Bishop of Gibraltar:\r\nSince my return, I have heard that his Lordship found all his efforts\r\nuseless to conciliate the Malta papistical authorities; that he was much\r\nshocked at their treachery; and that he was determined, on his return\r\nagain to Malta, _to become once more a good Protestant_. The truth is, he\r\nhad nothing to do with the Roman Catholics. He was to mind and care for\r\nthe Protestants in Malta, and on the shores of the Mediterranean. I\r\nbelieve, however, he did do something in the way of unpleasant\r\ninterference with Colonel Warrington. It is well known the Colonel was\r\nhigh-priest of Protestantism through his long Consular service of\r\nthirty-three years, as well as Her Britannic Majesty's Consul. The\r\nColonel baptized, married, and buried, whenever applied to. He baptized,\r\nmarried, and buried the members of his own family, and was surprised Sir\r\nThomas Reade had not the courage to do the same. Of this the Colonel was\r\nvery proud, citing the authority of some peer in the British Parliament,\r\nwho said, \"If the King's subjects wished to _procreate_ in a foreign\r\nland, where there was no parson, why should not the British Consul help\r\nthem?\" This the Bishop demurred at; but the Colonel supported himself on\r\nthe authority of Dr. Lushington. The Colonel was undoubtedly right.\r\nStill, politically and ecclesiastically, it would be much better if\r\nEnglish clergymen of some denomination or other were established along\r\nthe line of the whole coast of North Africa, which would show the native\r\nMussulmans we had a religion, and that we could afford to support and\r\nprotect our co-religionists. The French reap a good harvest by _their\r\nprotection of Christians_, which, characteristically enough, they use as\r\na political engine of aggrandizement.\r\n\r\nOn returning home, my Moorish friends pestered me still with more\r\nquestions, as to what people were _before_ the Christians. I endeavoured\r\nto impress upon them, that the Christian era was comparatively _new_, and\r\nthat _before_ Christ, there were many nations, and great events occurred.\r\nI found them grossly ignorant. But I had the good fortune to procure an\r\nArabic map in the possession of one of the merchants, who had laid it up\r\nfor many years amongst dusty papers. This had been published by the\r\nprinters and agents of the Church Missionary Society of Malta, very much\r\nto their credit. By the aid of this, I made more progress in teaching\r\ngeography to the people. Seeing several dots on the map where _Sahara_ is\r\nwritten, the people asked me what it meant. I told them sand. However, I\r\nmust protest against this device. We shall see that the greater part of\r\nThe Desert is stone and hard earth. The term \"_sandy border_\" of The\r\nDesert is equally incorrect. Such a distinction does not exist in the\r\nTripoline provinces. The Desert comes up to the gates of Tripoli, it then\r\ngives way to cultivation and The Mountains; it beyond them appears again\r\nhere and there and everywhere, within and without the regions of rain.\r\nThere is nothing like a border of The Desert. The \"Grand Desert\" and\r\n\"Petite Desert\" of the French, are equally incorrect and absurd. All is\r\nSahara, or waste, uncultivated lands, and oases scattered thick within\r\nthem, as spots on the back of the leopard[42].\r\n\r\nSaw the Rais late, who had heard all about my conversation with Ettanee,\r\nand jokingly said, \"_Wâr, wâr_, that old fellow, aye?\" His Excellency\r\nturned, to other matters: \"The Shânbah are not going to attack the\r\nTouaricks, they are coming hereabouts to plunder our caravans.\" Asked\r\nhim, if the city was secure enough to prevent them entering and pillaging\r\nit? His Excellency replied, \"Yes,\" but adding, \"_koul sheyan maktoub_\r\n(all is predestinated).\" This doctrine is not only a comfort in every\r\nmisfortune, but also an apology for every fault, crime, or mismanagement\r\na person may be guilty of. Nay, if a man be starved to death, because he\r\nwill not work, which is sometimes the case in this part of the world, as\r\nwell as Ireland, it is destiny and the will of God! . . . . . . So of all\r\nother things. If Ghadames should be stormed and plundered by the Shânbah\r\nin its present defenceless condition, it will be, as a matter of course,\r\nthe will of God. But I must add, which unhappily cannot be said of\r\nIreland, the security of human life is very great in Ghadames and the\r\nneighbouring desert. I have heard of no murder since I have been here,\r\nand a murder is the last thing thought of. This does not arise from any\r\npreventitive police, but from the simple dispositions of the\r\npeople--their horror and unwillingness to shed human blood! If a\r\nmessenger from a distant planet were to come to prove the divinity of a\r\nreligion, from the absence of the crime of murder, and were to take these\r\nSaharan oases, and our Ireland, and put them in the balances of Eternal\r\nJustice, we should soon see Ireland and its popular religion kick the the\r\nbeam, as--\r\n\r\n         \"The fiend look'd up, and knew\r\n    His mounted scale aloft.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"signs of the times\" in this country are, when I first came here\r\nbread was found in the Souk occasionally, as a luxury for the poor who\r\ncould not buy wheat and make bread; now, and it is only a little more\r\nthan a month, no bread is to be found. To-day not a single sheep was\r\nkilled anywhere, and I am obliged to go without meat. So the country\r\nprogresses in poverty and misery, so rapidly is its money being filched\r\nfrom the people! Or, is it because every body has conspired together\r\nagainst the Rais, and determined to wear an air of abject poverty? And\r\nthus to evade the new contributions? This cannot be. To-morrow is the\r\nlast day of Ramadan; provided the new moon can be seen. I hope they'll\r\nsee it, for I am heartily sick of the Ramadan: the most amiable and\r\nkind-hearted get out of humour in Ramadan; as to the Rais, I never go to\r\nsee him, except in the evening, unless to get a little money from him,\r\nhis Excellency being my banker. A Turk, who smokes all day long for\r\neleven months out of twelve, must suffer greatly in these thirty days.\r\nShould like to have tried a day's fasting, as I have been so strongly\r\nrecommended by the people, but I expect to have enough of fasting in The\r\nDesert, and it is of no use adding to our miseries for the sake of\r\ncuriosity or vanity. From recent conversations, it appears there is no\r\ngreat danger in attempting Timbuctoo, but I have resolved on the route of\r\nKanou, because my object is not so much a journey of discovery, as to\r\ncollect a statistical account of the slave-trade, and see whether there\r\nare any practicable legitimate means for extinguishing the odious\r\ntraffic. For this latter object, the Kanou route is decidedly more\r\nadvantageous. A wild adventure to Timbuctoo, ever so successful, can\r\nnever serve me in such stead in the end, when I have to read my own heart\r\nand its motives, as a humane mission on the behalf of unhappy weak\r\nAfricans, doomed, by men calling themselves Christians, to the curse of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n_1st October._--Sheikh Makouran paid me a visit this morning. Our\r\nconversation turned chiefly on the discoveries of lands and countries\r\nsince the times of Christ and Mahomet. The Sheikh was a little surprised\r\nwhen I told him: \"We ought to consider the world as just beginning, for\r\nthe ancients knew but little, and the greater part of the now inhabited\r\nworld was unknown to them.\" Moors, like some Christians, think the time\r\nis near when Deity shall appear to destroy all unbelievers in their\r\nrespective religions. For myself, I cannot but believe that the world has\r\nonly _yet_ begun. It is impossible that the Creator should destroy the\r\nworld in its present imperfect state. No--the world will go on yet\r\nthousands of years on years in the path of improvement unto (_shall I\r\nsay?_) perfection. At any rate, I belong to those whose aspirations are\r\nfor the future and not for the past. I am not enamoured with Hebrew\r\npatriarchal innocence, or Grecian classic polish and freedom, or\r\nChristian mediæval chivalry of the past. I am of the _New_ Englanders,\r\nbut not for the resurrection of the past. Rather than subscribe to\r\ndivinely-anointed kings and pious monks, church charities and May-day\r\nholidays and May-poles for the people, I would sooner affix my signature\r\nto railways, electric telegraphs, and the wild, bold, and raving\r\naspirations of a Shelley--in fact, to plunge anywhere head _foremost_,\r\nthan back again into the past.\r\n\r\nA Moor to-day, in wishing to give a grand idea of the Touaricks (some of\r\nwhom were present), said, \"Muley Abd Errahman (Emperor of Morocco) and\r\nthe Sultan of Stamboul, pay tribute to the Touaricks; but they pay\r\ntribute to no one.\" This is ingeniously made out by the merchants of\r\nTripoli and Morocco, the subjects of the two Sultans, being obliged to\r\npay black-mail in passing through the Saharan districts of the Touaricks.\r\nSome of the ill-natured are continually magnifying the dangers of the\r\nroute of Kanou, and one present said, \"You can't go, there are thousands\r\nof Touaricks to block up your way.\" Annoyed with this man and others, I\r\nreplied, \"Do Touaricks eat the flesh of Christians after they have killed\r\nthem?\" This made him very angry, and he began to apologize for the\r\nTouaricks, one class of Mohammedans being always anxious to defend\r\nanother from unwonted or odious suspicions. They have, nevertheless, not\r\nthe least difficulty in confessing that the Touaricks will kill\r\nChristians, as such, thus tacitly acknowledging it to be right to kill\r\nChristians. The more respectable Ghadamseeah argue that in no case, if I\r\npay the Touaricks a certain sum as tribute, or what not, have the\r\nTouaricks a right by the law of the Prophet to do me the least harm.\r\nHeard all the Arab soldiers have run away from Emjessen, being without\r\nanything to eat. These wise Turkish commanders gave the poor fellows a\r\nbag of barley and a little oil, and left it, like the widow's cruse in\r\nHoly Writ, to replenish itself. The Shânbah may now go and drink the\r\nwater of the well, and plunder the caravans as they please. The wonder is\r\nthat more open-desert robberies are not committed.\r\n\r\nThe Rais told me this evening that _one_ person saw the moon, but it is\r\nnecessary _two_ should have seen the dim, pale, half-invisible crescent\r\nstreak. Then the _âyed_ after the fast would have been to-morrow. At\r\nsun-set, all the people were on the _qui-vive_, the Marabouts mounting\r\nthe minaret tops, but none saw it but this solitary moongazer, who, said\r\nthe Rais, \"might have _imagined_ he saw the moon.\" The telescope was not\r\nlawful, he added, \"The people must see it with the naked, unassisted\r\neye.\"\r\n\r\n_2nd._--No patients; only a little girl with severe ophthalmia, and the\r\nold blind man, who fancies his eyes are better with the application of\r\nthe caustic. Generally the Moors think there is a different sort of\r\nmedicine for women. Yesterday I was asked for a medicine for women. I\r\ngave a man a fever powder for his wife. This morning being the last\r\nbefore the Ramadan, the Rais sent me a _backsheesh_ of meat (not cooked)\r\nand a quantity of rice, enough to make a sumptuous festa. Certainly the\r\nRais is very gracious, and continues, if not increases, in his friendly\r\nfeelings towards me. People are killing and preparing for the festival.\r\nThere's a report, the merchants in Tripoli are afraid to leave for this\r\ncity on account of rumoured depredations of the Sebâah and Shânbah.\r\nTo-morrow, my taleb says he marries his two daughters. He prepares the\r\nwedding-feast, and gives his daughters a stock of _semen_ (liquid\r\nbutter), and barley and wheat, to begin the world with. The sons-in-law\r\nmake presents to their brides of clothes, besides a little money; and\r\nthis is all the matter. My taleb seems very glad to get rid of his\r\ndaughters so easily; they are extremely young--thirteen and fifteen.\r\nBesides these daughters he has a pet son. People usually choose a\r\nreligious festival, for the day of the celebration of their nuptials, as\r\nin some parts of England. The taleb then, who is excessively fond of\r\nreligious discussion, began, \"The essence of all religion is,--\r\n\r\n     ‮وهو لا يولد ولا مولد‬\r\n    _He_ (God) _neither begets nor is begotten_: and\r\n\r\n     ‮وما عند الله شركاً‬\r\n    _God has no associate_\":--\r\n\r\nboth referring to the unity of God. Speaking of the duration of the\r\nworld, I said:--\"The world must now begin, for, up to this time, men have\r\nbeen generally very ignorant; and until lately the whole of the earth has\r\nnot been discovered.\" Very angry at this, he replied:--\"Now the world\r\nwill finish; God is coming to destroy all you Christians, and all the\r\nblack _kafers_ (infidels), as well as the white.\" He then gave me an\r\naccount of the creation. \"The world,\" he said, \"was created seven times,\"\r\n&c., &c., adding many curious things.\r\n\r\n_I._--\"What is to become of the world; are nearly all its inhabitants,\r\nfrom its beginning until now, to be d----d?\"\r\n\r\n_He._--\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Is this the decree of God?\"\r\n\r\n_He._--\"Yes, all is _maktoub_.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"But you say, God, is ‮الرحمان الرحيم‬,\r\n      (_Most merciful_.)\"\r\n\r\n_He._--\"Yes; but men won't obey his religion and Mahomet.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"What is to become of those who never saw, nor never could see or\r\nread the Koran?\"\r\n\r\n_The Taleb._--\"I don't know; God is great; God must have mercy upon\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Undoubtedly God created the world; but according to you, the world\r\nis now all corrupt (_fesad_), and nearly all men must soon be destroyed.\r\nIs this honourable to God?\"\r\n\r\n_The Taleb._--\"All is decreed.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"But many of the unbelieving Infidels are better than the Touaricks\r\nand Arabs. Is not the British Consul in Tripoli better than a Shânbah\r\nbandit?--better than an assassin who cuts the throats of the Faithful? Do\r\nnot all the people speak well of our Consul?\"\r\n\r\n_The Taleb._--\"I know it; he's very good.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"But you can't change the religion of some people though you kill\r\nthem. When the Mohammedans conquered India, they got tired of putting\r\nHindoos to death for not changing their religion, and becoming\r\nMussulmans.\"\r\n\r\n_The Taleb._--\"God knows all, but you don't know,\" (a frequent phrase in\r\nthe Koran).\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Now, I don't think it's of much use to talk about religion, for\r\nyou won't change yours nor I mine. Here's the end of the matter. We must\r\nall die, that's a thing no one disputes; but as to who is saved, or who\r\nperishes, we cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\n_The Taleb._--\"The truth, by G--d! If God please, we shall see all soon.\"\r\n\r\nA small caravan of Arabs, bringing sheep for the _Ayed_, arrived this\r\nmorning from Tunis. The route is _viâ_ Jibel Douerat, and only seven\r\ndays. If the roads were safe, travelling indeed about North Africa could\r\nsoon be rendered expeditious. The Arabs report:--\"That great military\r\npreparations are making at Jerbah, where the Bey of Tunis is expected\r\nafter the _Ayed_, and whence he will invade Tripoli, all his Arabs being\r\nready to march with him.\" After this, a caravan of forty slaves arrived\r\nfrom the south, under the conduct of Touaricks. The _ghafalah_ is\r\noriginally from Bornou, but half left for Fezzan on arriving at Ghat. Was\r\nmuch surprised when Rais told me this evening, after five or six days, he\r\nwould send a soldier to sleep as a guard in my house. He explained he had\r\nreceived authentic intelligence from Souf, of the Shânbah banditti being\r\non the march, five hundred strong, proceeding in the direction of Ghat\r\nand Ghadames, and he expected them near this in the course of ten days.\r\nTheir intention is to avenge themselves on the Touaricks for the defeat\r\nlast year. They are the immemorial enemies of the Touaricks, who have a\r\nstake in the commerce of the Desert, but they as professional robbers\r\nhave none. Besides this, we hear the Sebâah continue their depredations,\r\nand have carried off 2,000 sheep from The Mountains: they also threaten\r\nan attack on Derge. The whole country, indeed, will soon be full of\r\nbanditti, unless some energetic measures are adopted, and we shall have\r\nno communication between this and Tripoli. All the routes are now\r\nconsidered unsafe. Rais assured me, he has applied to the Pasha for a few\r\nTurkish troops, but His Highness refused, on the plea of expense. The\r\nwhole force of the Rais is not a hundred Arabs, and poor miserable\r\nfellows they are, with two or three horses placed at their disposal. With\r\nsuch inconsiderable means the Pacha presumes to hold in the heart of The\r\nDesert this important commercial city, and its dependencies of Seenawan\r\nand Derge! The French manage matters very differently in Algeira. Indeed,\r\nthe united force occupying all Tripoli, with its wide-spread provinces of\r\nmany hundred miles apart, does not exceed _five_ thousand men of all\r\narms! Compare this to the hundred and thirty thousand men (including\r\nnative troops) in Algeira, and be astonished at the different effects of\r\nthe French and Turkish systems. . . . . To add to the Rais's\r\nembarrassments, the people are in ill-humour, whilst some hear the news\r\nwith pleasure, and fancy they see in our present troubles the beginning\r\nof the end of Turkish rule in Ghadames.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] This book is said to be eternal as God himself, even\r\n    UNCREATED. This is argued metaphysically from all the thoughts and\r\n    volitions of Deity being eternal and immutable, and therefore the\r\n    laws of the Koran have no relation to time or creation.\r\n\r\n[40] Most of the people here have heard of Scinde; but their\r\n    knowledge of it is very imperfect.\r\n\r\n[41] I afterwards learnt it was--\"You see these Christians are\r\n    eating up all the Mussulman countries.\"\r\n\r\n[42] Strabo mentions the oasis:--\"To the south of Atlas lies a\r\n    vast desert of sand and stones, which, like the spotted skin of a\r\n    panther, is here and there diversified by oases, or fertile\r\n    grounds, like isles in the midst of the ocean.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED RESIDENCE IN GHADAMES.\r\n\r\n     The Ayed (little Festival of Moslems).--Ghadames a City of\r\n     Marabouts.--Every Accident of Life ascribed to Deity.--Second\r\n     Day's Feast, Swinging and Amusements of the People.--Death of the\r\n     Sultan of Timbuctoo.--Various Terms employed for denoting\r\n     Garden.--French Woman in The Desert.--Price of Slaves.--Time\r\n     required to go round the World.--Stature of the Touaricks.--Oases\r\n     of Derge.--Reconquest of the World by the Mahometans.--Tibboo\r\n     Slave-dealer.--Touatee Silversmith and Blacksmith.--Assassination\r\n     of Major Laing.--Tibboos compared to Bornouese.--The Touarick\r\n     Bandit again.--First Encounter with the Giant Touarick.--Water of\r\n     Ghadames unhealthy.--Manacles for Slaves.--Second Meeting with\r\n     the Giant.--The Souafah, and Tuggurt.--Visit from the\r\n     Giant.--Chapter in the Domestic History of Ghadames.--Serpents\r\n     and Scorpions, the Banditti of The Desert.--Toys Prohibited.--The\r\n     Wahabites.--How Moslems despise Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3rd._--THE Ayed ‮عيد‬, succeeding Ramadan, is ushered in with a\r\ncold morning, the first cold morning I have felt in The Desert.\r\nMight venture to put on my cloth pantaloons. Happy to feel this\r\ninvigorating cold. This is the little âyed; the âyed kebir, or âyed\r\nSeedna Ibrahim, takes place two months hence, when every family, in\r\nimitation of Abraham offering up his son Isaac, kills or sacrifices\r\na lamb. The caravan from Bornou reports the road to be good. It is\r\nadded, rain has fallen in Ghat as well as in The Sahara, near Tunis\r\nand Tripoli, so that the oasis of Ghadames is the only dry spot, for\r\nno rain has yet fallen.\r\n\r\nHad several visits from persons all dressed out in festival finery,\r\namongst the rest the black dervish. He looked like a dusky Nigritian\r\nSultan. Twenty paras he condescended to take from me, which added to his\r\nholiday happiness; sometimes he won't accept of money. Now comes Ben\r\nMousa, my taleb, to pay his respects. Not, as amongst the great unwashed\r\nof London, do they shave for a penny and give a glass of ---- (I shall\r\nnot say what), in the bargain, here in Ghadames they shave for nothing.\r\n\"How is this,\" I said to my turjeman who had now come in. \"This is the\r\ncustom of the country,\" he replied, \"we always shave one another for\r\nfriendship.\" There are several other little things done _gratuitously_ in\r\nGhadames, but shaving the head is the principal one[43]. He who has the\r\nsharpest razor is expected to do the most work. They cut and hack one\r\nanother about most barbarously, some using no soap, only rubbing a little\r\nwater over their heads. I have seen a score in a row, all sitting on the\r\nground, waiting patiently their turn. Some shave the head every month,\r\nothers allow several months to elapse. By way of diverting conversation,\r\nmy taleb had the extreme kindness to tell me that the Touaricks of Aheer\r\nand Aghadez (not those of Ghat) killed Christians and Jews on the\r\nprinciple of religion, and would refuse to compound matters, even if I\r\ngave them a thousand dollars. He, however, condescended to add, \"They are\r\n_mahboul_ (foolish).\" He then went on to boast of the sanctity of this\r\ncity, and said, \"Our people are not afraid of the Sebâah and Shânbah,\r\nbecause they are a city of marabouts.\" The taleb had just come from a\r\nfull divan of the people, where the Rais, on this festival morning, had\r\nbeen haranguing them and flattering their prejudices. \"Be assured,\" said\r\nthe Governor, \"if the Bashaw knew that you were a holy city, _a city of\r\ndervishes_, a zaweea (or sanctuary), he would write to the Sultan at\r\nConstantinople, and the Sultan, hearing of this, would immediately give\r\norders that no 6,000 mahboubs were to be exacted from you, but that, on\r\nthe contrary, money from the Sultan would be sent to you, holy people.\" I\r\nwondered that a man of the Rais's sense could so commit himself. What\r\nwould he have done if after the âyed, the people had brought a petition\r\nto him, addressed to the Sultan, setting forth that they were \"_a city of\r\nmarabouts_,\" and praying to have their tribute remitted? But the poor\r\npeople are incapable of taking such an advantage. They were excited by\r\ntheir religious feelings, and believed all the Rais told them. It was\r\ncertainly a fine compliment for the feast, to men in the situation of the\r\npeople of Ghadames. And my informant added: \"Ahmed Effendi in The\r\nMountains is the rascal and the infidel, and does not tell the Pasha we\r\nare a nation of dervishes.\" Said told me a slave was brought up to day to\r\nbe bastinadoed, but reprieved till to-morrow on account of the feast.\r\nSaid's sympathy is always excited on these occasions, he remembers\r\nancient days. On asking what he had done, he said, \"The slave stole some\r\ndates because he had nothing to eat.\" My taleb, occasionally rather free\r\nin tongue, took upon himself to call all Negroes _thieves_. I admonished\r\nhim: \"The poor slaves got little from this city of dervishes, now and\r\nthen a little barley-meal, or lived almost altogether on a few dates. It\r\nwas not surprising they stole to satisfy the cravings of hunger.\" Berka\r\nthe liberated slave of Makouran, and Said's intimate friend, now came in,\r\ndressed up in his holiday clothes. He asked for Said. \"He is gone to The\r\nDesert, run away, for he has broken our cooking-pot; see here are the\r\npieces, here's the meat spoilt; what am I to do for dinner?\" I added, \"He\r\nought to have a good beating.\" The poor old negro stared and looked\r\nreally grieved. At last he muttered, \"Why, Christian, that _breaking_\r\ncomes from God, and not Said.\" \"The truth,\" said the taleb laughing. Said\r\nnow came in, having borrowed another pot, and Berka was comforted at the\r\nreturn of his friend. In The Desert, every accident of life is ascribed\r\nto an ever-present and all-superintending Divinity!\r\n\r\nAll people enjoy their festival or carnival, to-day. They follow the\r\nreckoning of Tripoli, but as the people saw the moon a day sooner there,\r\na day of fasting is here saved. It is so fortunate not to see the moon\r\ntoo soon. The appointed Ramadan is twenty-nine or thirty days; ours is\r\ntwenty-nine. However, rigid Moslems did not begin to eat to-day till\r\nnoon, after the morning prayers, so delicately scrupulous are they. My\r\ntaleb agrees with me, that the Arabs, who usually only eat in the\r\nevening, and don't smoke, experience but little inconvenience from the\r\nfast. Nothing particular took place to-day's âyed, except every one being\r\ndressed in his best clothes, and most of the youth having on something\r\n_new_. It is the same with the Jews of Mogador on the feast of Passover.\r\nThe Sanctuaries hoist the holy colours of their religion, beautiful\r\nvermilion, and yellow, and green; these are their holiest and most-loved\r\ncolours. The slaves danced and sang all day long. I was present during\r\nthe closing scene at night, which was curious. After their continuous and\r\nlaborious dancing, they all suddenly stopped as if struck with paralysis,\r\noffered a prayer to Allah, and dispersed. Did not go out till evening,\r\nfor if I had gone out at all in the day-time I must have dressed up, and\r\nI did not wish to appear a Guy Fawkes amongst the people, or excite their\r\ncuriosity or prejudices on the day of a solemn festival. The Rais asked\r\nwhy I did not come in the morning, for this was a grand receiving-day,\r\nwhen all his particular friends and the heads of the people paid him\r\nvisits. On telling him, he approved my reason, and said, \"You, Yâcob,\r\nhave _compass yaiser_ (plenty of wit).\"\r\n\r\n_4th._--To-day is half a feast, and full-grown men and aged men are\r\namusing themselves with swinging, like so many boys. A dead aoudad was\r\nbrought in from The Sahara, which the Touaricks had killed. These\r\nTouaricks are also bearers of a letter, written at Timbuctoo, which has\r\ncome the round-about way of Soudan, announcing that the Sultan of\r\nTimbuctoo is dead. Sidi Mokhtar, a marabout, is appointed Governor of\r\nTimbuctoo by the new Sultan. The Sultan himself, after visiting Timbuctoo\r\nand making this appointment, retired to Jinnee, his royal residence.\r\nSheikh El-Mokhtar has a good reputation; he is now occupied reorganizing\r\nhis government. No other news. Met in the streets one of the Touaricks\r\nwho came yesterday with fifteen camel-loads of senna. Asked him if\r\nTouaricks killed Christians. Surprised at this abrupt question, he asked,\r\n\"_Why?_\" I added, \"If you are a good fellow I will go with you to Ghat.\"\r\nPleased at this confidence, he came home with me and took some coffee. A\r\ncamel-load of senna now sells for seventeen mahboubs. He asked me what\r\nthe Christians did with the senna, and would not believe it was all used\r\nfor physic. Said Christians were not numerous enough to drink all they\r\nbought. There is a wady near Ghat covered with senna, during rain, but\r\nthe greater portion of senna is brought from Aheer.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the way in which the Arabic language is used, and\r\nwhich makes some people think there are different dialects in this\r\nlanguage, may be given in the terms denoting _Garden_. For garden,\r\nthe Touaricks and people of Touat use ‮جنّة‬, a word which\r\nfrequently occurs in the Koran, conveying the highest and purest\r\nidea of garden, and which we usually translate \"_paradise_.\" In\r\nGhadamsee and Touarghee a corruption of this pure Arabic word is used for\r\nheaven, ‮اجّن‬. The Tripoline and Tunisian Moors use the term\r\n‮سانية‬, and the people here ‮قابة‬, for garden, but\r\nwhich is, rather, kitchen-garden. Now, all these words are good Arabic, and\r\nmay be used indifferently, at least the two latter. In the New\r\nTestament translation, the Persian ‮بستان‬ is used, which I\r\nimagine is the Eastern term for garden generally, in opposition to the\r\nwestern ‮سانية‬. _The Garden_ in North Africa is very different\r\nfrom our ideas of a garden. Corn-fields, overshadowed with the palm, the\r\nolive, and a few other fruit-trees, is the species of plantation to\r\nwhich the term is usually applied. Certainly a few flowers are\r\nsometimes cultivated in these gardens of Africa, but this is the\r\nexception to the usage.\r\n\r\nThe Rais, who is a grave Turk, nevertheless unbended himself to-day,\r\namusing himself in seeing the boys swing. The Moors sadly wanted me to\r\njoin their swinging, but I politely declined. They said, it was\r\n\"_medicine_,\" meaning good for the health, everything conducive to health\r\nbeing called \"_medicine_\" by people in The Desert. Was gratified to see\r\nsome sports amongst the people, for the men are always gloomy and\r\nreclining about the streets, brooding over their ruinous affairs, and the\r\nboys are little encouraged to healthful and innocent games. Up to this\r\ntime, the only persons I have seen happy are the slaves, who dance and\r\nsing, and forget everything but the present moment. The swings are tied\r\nhigh up to the tallest date-palms, two or three persons swing together,\r\nand the sport is a little dangerous. Saw no other amusements during the\r\nâyed, except here and there drafts, played in the primitive way of making\r\nsmall holes in the sand for the squares.\r\n\r\nDuring the expedition of the Duke d'Aumale to the south of Algeria, the\r\nBey of Biskera, Mohammed-es-Sagheer (\"little\") murdered the small\r\ngarrison of soldiers left behind, emptied the chest of what francs were\r\nin it, and went off to The Desert. He is now living tranquilly in the\r\nJereed. The French made a demand to the Bey of Tunis to have him given\r\nup, but it seems His Highness had courage enough to resist it, alleging\r\nthat he was a political refugee. Mohammed-es-Sagheer had married a French\r\nwoman, and she ran away, or was taken by force, with him. She had borne\r\nhim two children. The most extraordinary stories are current of this\r\nFrench woman. Though a low woman of one of the towns, she gives herself\r\nout as \"the daughter of the Sultan of France!\" She rides like a man,\r\ndresses like a man, smokes, and follows the Arabs in all their\r\nexpeditions _against_ the French. She has adopted the Mahometan religion,\r\nand is become a sort of priestess, or Maraboutah. She promises the\r\ncredulous Arabs that she will not only put her husband on the throne of\r\nAlgeria, but even of France itself, and then all the world will become\r\nMussulmans! The Moors say she can never leave The Desert because she has\r\nbrought her husband two children.\r\n\r\nSaw Rais in the evening, and had a sort of confidential conversation with\r\nhim, and told him for the _first_ time of my intention to proceed further\r\nin the interior. Of course, he had heard of it before from his servants.\r\nNevertheless, he affected great surprise and sorrow. But, when I told him\r\nI might return in six months hence, he became more calm. He then\r\npersuaded me by all means to avoid the routes of the Touaricks, and\r\nproceed to Fezzan, thence to Bornou. Speaking of the Ghadamsee merchants\r\nand their friends and correspondents, Messrs. Silva, Labe, Shaloum, and\r\nFrancovich, in Tripoli, he said, \"Your merchants exchange products with\r\nthe Ghadamseeah in the way of barter, and make a great deal of money,\r\nwhilst the Ghadamseeah have no money left, none at all.\" He wondered,\r\nlike the Touaricks, what the Christians do with all the senna. He\r\nexpected the Shânbah, on the route of Ghat, in a few days' time. I\r\nobserved, \"People are all superbly dressed, and there was not much\r\nappearance of poverty.\" He smiled, and said, \"The people are _sheytan_\r\n(very cunning), they lay up their new clothes, and only wear them on\r\nfestivals.\" Speaking of slaves, his Excellency said, \"There is now no\r\nprofit on slaves. Government takes ten mahboubs duty on each. A good\r\nslave fetches 40,000 wadâ (cowries) in Soudan, usual price 30,000, and\r\nsome as low as 15,000. A good slave sells in Ghadames for forty\r\nmahboubs.\" The Rais told me to take care of the vermin, and abused the\r\nfilthiness of the people. If I escape the Touaricks and the fevers as\r\nwell as I escape the vermin, which abound on the clothes of all the\r\npeople without exception, I shall consider myself fortunate. The\r\ninhabitants of Ghadames make no scruple in attacking the enemy in the\r\npublic streets, which stick to them closer than their dearest friends. I\r\nattribute my escape to my being an infidel, for their orthodox l-i-c-e\r\nwon't have anything to do with Kafers.\r\n\r\nPeople look worse than during the Ramadan. Poor creatures, they have\r\nlittle to eat; they say they have nothing but barley-meal and dates to\r\neat, for the Turks have taken away all their money. Some, however, as a\r\nluxury, which their relations and friends send them from Soudan,\r\nmasticate _ghour_[44]-nuts, and which I believe is the _kolat_, or\r\ncolat-nut of Caillié. The Arabs called these nuts the \"_Coffee of\r\nSoudan_.\" Konja is a great place for the growth of the ghour, two or\r\nthree months west of Kanou.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Weather gets colder every day. I was reflecting on the best\r\nsituation for a Consul in Northern Sahara. The point would be Touat, the\r\nnucleus of many routes, the great highways of commerce in The Desert.\r\nFrom this point a British Consul could keep a sharp look-out on the\r\nFrench, moving southward.\r\n\r\nA Mussulman doctor told me with great solemnity this morning, that five\r\nhundred years were necessary to go round the world. Two hundred years\r\ndesert (‮ك٘لع‬), or nothing, or containing--\r\n\r\n    \"(God's) _dark materials to create more worlds_.\"\r\n\r\nTwo hundred years of seas. Eighty years of Gog and Magog. Eighteen years\r\nof Soudan. And two years of white people, including Christians and\r\nMohammedans. There were countries full of Mussulmans which had not been\r\nvisited by the Mussulmans of Turkey or Africa. They had been visited by\r\none man only, Alexander the Great. Certainly the Moors read history\r\n_backwards_. On asking where this information was to be obtained, he\r\nsaid, \"From the _Tăfseer_ (Commentaries) of the Koran.\"\r\n\r\nThe Touaricks who have just arrived are men of very large stature, and as\r\n\"straight as a dart.\" Several of them are full six feet high. Such men\r\nare alone produced in the Sahara! All the weak and the diseased soon die\r\noff, leaving behind only the robust. They walk about the streets with an\r\nair of consummate pride, with their huge broad swords swung at the back,\r\nand their lances in their hands, like \"a tall pine.\"\r\n\r\nAn Arab, just arrived from Derge, brings intelligence that the Ghadamsee\r\npeople who were in Tunis are returning home _viâ_ Tripoli. These are\r\nmostly poor labourers, who go a few months to Tunis to amass a little\r\ncapital, with which to trade afterwards. The Ghadamsee is constantly\r\ngoing on these journeys of profit and enterprize, either as merchant or\r\nlabourer. His Desert home is the pulse of all his distant enterprises,\r\nwhither he retires to end his days, dedicating the last hours of his\r\nexistence to God. The Arab came from Derge, mounted on a good horse, in\r\nthe short time of _thirteen hours_,--by camels it occupies two and\r\ntwo-and-a-half days! The Arab told me he killed, a few days ago, six\r\nostriches near Derge. The oases of _Derge_ consist of four little oases,\r\nor districts, viz., Derge (proper), Terghuddah, Madress, and Fiffelt,\r\ncontaining an Arab population of 400 souls, a hardy and brave people.\r\nWater is plentiful, but there are no hot springs. A native told me, that\r\ninvariably any stranger drinking this water, was attacked with fever.\r\nGenerally these little oases are very unhealthy. Some assert that all who\r\nvisit the oases are taken ill. Probably, like Mourzuk, they lay low, in a\r\nwady or hollowed plain. Date-trees are numerous, and bear good fruit. A\r\nfair quantity of wheat and ghusub is grown. Besides sheep, and goats, and\r\nfowls, there is a few camels. The people are occupied in the gardens, but\r\ntoo numerous for the oases; they are very poor, and obliged to emigrate.\r\nDerge is in the more eastern route of Zantan and Rujban; and when that of\r\nSeenawan, the western, is not safe, this, the longer route, is taken.\r\n\r\n_6th._--Slept badly during the night; restless about my journey.\r\nDetermined now to take the Fezzan route. Weather very soft, with murky\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nRelating to my taleb, that, formerly, Mussulmans conquered Christians, but\r\nnow, all the countries of the Mediterranean were fast falling back again\r\ninto the hands of the Christians--such being the will of God, he consoled\r\nhimself by replying: \"That, in less than forty years will rise up one\r\nAbou Abdullah Mohammed El-Arbee El-Korashee El-Fatamee,\r\n(‮ابو عبد الله محمّد القرشي الفاطمي‬,) who\r\nwill kill all the Christians, both of the new[45] and the old\r\nworld; that this will be the golden age; all people will be\r\nMussulmans, and all will be rich and powerful, enjoying the\r\nabundance of this world's good things; and the very dust of the\r\nearth, and the sand of the Sahara, will be turned into gold and\r\nsilver: But, (the awful but!) that this will only last one\r\ngeneration, or _forty_ years; for then will arise The Dajal! who,\r\nmounting upon an ass, will scour the earth in three days, and kill\r\nand destroy all the Mussulmans, this Dajal being the Messiah of the\r\nJews, who will all flock to his standard; and that then will appear\r\nJesus, _the Son of Mary_[46], from the top of the mountains of the\r\nmoon, after Dajal has reigned forty years, and slay this monster\r\nMessiah of the Jews. Now there will appear Gog and Magog, let loose\r\nfrom Jibel Kaf, in Khoristan, and the country of the Turks and\r\nRussians. And last of all will come the end, when the Wahabites will\r\ncarry all the Jews into hell-fire on their backs.\" Such are the\r\nsecret consolations of a good and orthodox Mussulman of The Sahara.\r\nA part of this monstrous fable has been related before, with some\r\nvariations. The gist of the prophecy is, _the destruction of the\r\nChristians by another Arab Conqueror_. Here the now humbled follower\r\nof the Prophet finds his sweet revenge. The same revenge the more\r\nignorant and fanatic of the Jews seek and cherish in the advent of\r\ntheir long-expected Messiah, who is to enable them to put their feet\r\nupon the necks of all people--all the nations of the earth. But the\r\nbetter class of Israelites are willing to believe that the Gentile\r\nnations may enjoy a portion of the blessings of Messiah's reign, and\r\nwill not be effaced from the earth. Some pious Christians, who,\r\nfailing to convert men to their peculiar views of revelation,\r\nanticipate the appearance quickly of a sort of _Buonaparte_ Messiah,\r\narmed with similar attributes, who is to involve all infidel nations\r\nin seas of blood, and make the world a heap of Saharan desolation.\r\nSuch views of Christianity have always been abhorrent to my\r\nfeelings; and I have kept close to the fair and pacific pictures of\r\nMessiah's reign, so beautifully set forth by Pope:--\r\n\r\n    All crimes shall cease, and ancient frauds shall fail;\r\n    Returning Justice lift aloft her scale;\r\n    Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,\r\n    And white rob'd Innocence from Heaven descend.\r\n\r\n    The dumb shall sing--the lame his crutch forego,\r\n    And leap exulting like the bounding roe.\r\n    No sigh, no murmur, the wide world shall hear,\r\n    From every face He wipes off every tear.\r\n\r\n    No more shall nation against nation rise,\r\n    _Nor ardent warriors meet with hateful eyes_,\r\n    But useless lances into scythes shall bend,\r\n    And the broad falchion in a ploughshare end.\r\n\r\n    The swain in barren deserts with surprise,\r\n    Sees lilies spring and sudden verdure rise;\r\n    And starts, amidst the thirsty wilds, to hear,\r\n    New falls of water murmuring in his ear.\r\n\r\n    The steer and lion at one crib shall meet,\r\n    And harmless serpents lick the pilgrim's feet.\r\n    The smiling infant in his hand shall take,\r\n    The crested basilisk and speckled snake.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, went to see the slaves lately brought from Bornou. They were\r\nas much like merchandize as they could be, or human beings could be made\r\nto resemble it. They were entirely naked, with the exception of a strip\r\nof tanned skin tied round the loins. All were nearly alike, as so many\r\ngoods packed up of the same quality. They were very thin, and almost\r\nskeletons, about the age of from ten to fifteen years, with the round\r\nBornouse features strongly marked upon their countenances. These slaves\r\nare the property of a Tibboo. I invited the Tibboo home to my house, to\r\nglean some information from him. The Tibboo bought the slaves on\r\nspeculation in Bornou; he could now sell them at from forty to fifty\r\ndollars each. He had only six; the Touaricks had thirty-four. He came\r\nfrom Bornou to Ghat, thence to Ghadames. He had also some elephants'\r\nteeth. The Tibboo pressed me to buy his slaves; he had not yet found\r\npurchasers, though he had been here some days. The merchants have no\r\nmoney, or none to buy slaves. The Tibboo drank some tea with me, which he\r\nobserved was better than _bouzah_, fermented grain liquor. The Tibboo was\r\na young black, tall and slender, and of mild and not disagreeable\r\nfeatures. There was nothing in him to denote that he was a common\r\ntrafficker in human flesh and blood. He was not so much stamped with the\r\nnegro features as his slaves; he was, indeed, as much of a gentleman as a\r\nPresbyterian slave-holder of the United States, patronized by Doctors\r\nCunningham and Candlish, and admitted to the fellowship of Free Kirk\r\nSaints. The Tibboo was excessively curious about me, the Christian. He\r\nhandled and turned over everything I had. Seeing my naked (white) arm, he\r\nexclaimed, \"Whiter than the moon!\" Said did not approve of my new\r\nacquaintance, and declared all the Tibboos rascals; and thinks he\r\nrecollects that he was made a slave by the Tibboos. Said was very angry\r\nwith me for giving the Tibboo tea--wouldn't make any more for him--I\r\nmight make it myself. The Tibboo showed his sense of my attention, by\r\ngiving me some trona, which he says abounds in Bornou, and is called\r\n_konwa_. He champs it in its hard crystalline state, like children\r\nchamping sugar-candy. He mixes it with his tobacco, and says it is\r\npulverized and drank in solution for medicine at Bornou, like Epsom\r\nsalts, producing the same effects.\r\n\r\nTwo people left to-day for Ghat, and two for Timbuctoo. The latter were\r\nthe headmen of the large mercantile firm of Ettanee. It is the custom of\r\nSaharan merchants to send their headmen, and even slaves, to these\r\ndistant countries, when circumstances prevent them going themselves.\r\n\r\nMy friend the Touatee, who unites in himself a blacksmith and a\r\nsilversmith, was this evening employed in making ladies' ornaments for\r\narms and legs. He was in the course of finishing a pair of anclets,\r\nweighing together about thirty-eight ounces. Each anclet would cost 20\r\ndollars. They are for an Arab lady; but, of course, the husband invests\r\nhis money in this way until he can find profitable employment for it, or\r\nbecomes distressed. \"Meanwhile,\" says the Touatee, \"he has the kisses of\r\nhis wife for the investment, and is happier than if he obtained a hundred\r\nper cent. for his outlay of silver.\" The old Touatee distinctly\r\nrecollects Major Laing passing through Ghadames to Timbuctoo. The account\r\nhe gives of him is:--\"When in Ghadames the Rais (or Major) purchased\r\nsomething of every thing he could find in our city, as well as specimens\r\nof Soudan manufacture. He had with him _thirty-six bottles of wine_!\r\nwhich I counted. He was attacked by the Touaricks near Touat, and wounded\r\nin twenty places; but he cured his wounds, and then proceeded on and\r\narrived safe at Timbuctoo, where he stopped some time. Afterwards he went\r\nto Sansandy, where he was murdered.\" The unfortunate Major had no money\r\nin his possession when murdered, which greatly surprised the assassins,\r\nwho murdered him merely for his money. People add, he wrote every thing\r\nin Timbuctoo, but did not stop long there. He was enticed to go away with\r\na stranger, against the advice of the parties who conducted him to\r\nTimbuctoo. The stranger was a Saharan Arab. One of them is still living,\r\nHaj Kader, and left lately for Touat, who has the reputation of being a\r\nquiet and upright man. I did not hear of him until he was gone, otherwise\r\nI should have had some conversation with him about the Major. The other\r\nparty died at Timbuctoo; he was called the _Marabout_, and seems to have\r\nbeen another Mohammed (my marabout.) In a letter of the Major, read to me\r\nby Colonel Warrington, his father-in-law, the Major charges his Marabout\r\nwith having stolen his double-barrelled gun, and sent it on to Timbuctoo\r\nfor sale before they arrived there. For this theft, and other bad\r\nconduct, old Yousef Bashaw made a formal complaint against the people of\r\nGhadames, and mulcted them several thousand mahboubs. Mr. Gagliuffi heard\r\na strange story about the Major; according to which, he was murdered near\r\nTouat, on his return, by the same Touarick who stopped him, and wounded\r\nhim in twenty-six places, on his way thither, the Touarick alleging, that\r\nthe Major was not a man but a devil, so he (the Touarick) was obliged to\r\nkill him. No authentic account now will ever be collected of Major\r\nLaing's death. That he was stopped a couple of days beyond Aghobly, in\r\nthe oases of Touat, and there wounded, is certain; we have the Major's\r\nown account for it. He seems also to have remained a month at Timbuctoo,\r\nand wrote a full account of that mysterious city. He then, not being able\r\nto ascend or trace the Niger _viâ_ Jinnee, on account of the objections\r\nof the people, made a _détour_ through The Desert, wishing to go to\r\nSenegambia, when, after four days' journey, he was stopped by a party of\r\nArabs, and murdered. Some persist in saying, that Caillié found Major\r\nLaing's papers, and gave them as his _own_ account of Timbuctoo. I should\r\nbe sorry to attempt either to prove or contradict the charge. All the\r\ndocuments are in possession of the family of the late Colonel Warrington.\r\nWe must suspend our opinion until they are published, which I trust will\r\nnot be long.\r\n\r\nAfterwards visited the Rais, who is, like myself, very fond of the\r\nTouatee. His Excellency had a bad headache, and his _major-domo_ was hard\r\nat work rubbing his head with his hands. I laughed, but said nothing. The\r\npeople are fond of manipulation, and shampooning (_Temras_). Whenever any\r\none hurts himself by bruises or falls, the limb affected is rubbed and\r\nstretched, and stretched and rubbed, until the poor sufferer's limb is\r\nnearly severed from his body. Manipulation ought to have made the fourth\r\nmode of cure laid down by my marabout, after burning, blood-letting, and\r\ntalismanic writing. However, I believe manipulation, aided by the bath,\r\nfrequently effects important cures. Some Moors indeed, consider this the\r\nsovereign remedy for every hurt and disease. Found the Touatee again with\r\nthe Rais. He amused us both by giving his opinion about the\r\n_inexhaustible_ supply of slaves furnished by Nigritia. \"All other\r\ncountries,\" said he, \"die and become depopulated. It is now ten thousand\r\nyears we go to buy slaves in Soudan. The oftener we go there the more we\r\nfind. In that country the men are all night long begetting children, and\r\nthe women all the morning bringing them forth. This is the reason the\r\nsupply of slaves never becomes exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n_7th._--Said has just come in and told me I must not eat many of the\r\ndates of this country, for they have killed some of the soldiers, and\r\nwill kill me. Dates may, indeed, injure the poor soldiers, who have\r\nnothing else to eat. One died yesterday. I asked his comrades what he\r\ndied of, who replied, \"_Hunger_.\" It is a disgrace to the Government of\r\nTripoli to keep these wretched Arabs without any thing to eat. Why not\r\nlet them go to their native mountain homes; for there, though they may\r\npine away and die in the caverns of the Atlas, they will nevertheless\r\ngive up the ghost in the arms of friends and relations--joining misery to\r\nmisery, where the miserable may comfort the miserable. But, here, amidst\r\nthe rude buffs of strangers, it is cruel to let them die like dogs.\r\n\r\nThe Tibboo called this morning. Merchants have offered him only 35\r\nmahboubs each for his slaves; he asks from 40 to 50. He says, the\r\nAmericans, or people nearly as white as I am, ascend the Niger as far as\r\nNoufee, for the purchase of slaves. Bornou and the surrounding countries\r\nare now in peace, and make no slaves by war. The Tibboo bought his\r\nslaves of persons who kidnapped them during the night. To observe, that\r\nalthough the Tibboos, if this merchant be a fair representation of them,\r\nhave not such extended nostrils as the Bornouse, and such thick\r\nprojecting lips, yet they are much darker than the Bornouse. Indeed, the\r\nBornouse are of a lighter, _fairer_ complexion than any of the Negroes I\r\nhave yet seen, those of Soudan and Timbuctoo being of a much darker\r\nshade, and some quite black. The Bornouse has a round, chubby, smiling\r\nface; the Tibboo, a long, grave, intellectual face. The old Touarick\r\nbandit called to-day, with other Touaricks, and asked how much I would\r\ngive for a _live aoudad_. Told him from 6 to 8 mahboubs. He said they're\r\ngoing to hunt them next month. This retired cut-throat gave himself a\r\ngood character, and the Touaricks generally. \"Trust us, don't be afraid\r\nof the Touaricks, upon our heads (_raising his sword to his head_,) we'll\r\nprotect you!\" Then stepped in an old friend and lover of the mysteries of\r\ngeography. These are some of his questions:--\"Where is the sea by which\r\nthe Christians go to Soudan? Where is Mount Kaf, that girdles the earth\r\nwith brass and iron? Where are Gog and Magog, which is Muskou (_Russia_),\r\nthe monster which eats up the _Moumeneen_ (_faithful Mohammedans_)?\" &c.\r\nWent out and saw for the first time the Giant Touarick. The huge fellow\r\nmust be 6 feet 9 inches. His limbs were like the trunks of the palm, and\r\nhe walked with a step as firm as a rock; whilst his voice was a gruff\r\ngrowl like distant thunder. Compare this noble, though monstrous,\r\nspecimen of a man, the product of the wild uncongenial Sahara, to the\r\nlittle ricketty, squeaking, vivacious wretch of the kindly clime of\r\nItaly, \"the garden of Europe,\" and be amazed at the ways in which works\r\nProvidence! As soon as the giant saw me, he bellowed out, \"Salam\r\naleikom!\" which far resounded through the dark winding streets. He now\r\nstrode by without stopping to speak or to look at me, his head and turban\r\nnearly reaching the roof of the streets, and his big sword, swinging from\r\nhis back, extended crosswise, scraping the mortar from both sides of the\r\nwalls. His iron spear, as large as an ordinary iron gas-light post, was\r\ncarried in his firm fist horizontally, to prevent its catching the roof\r\nof the covered streets. The giant is one of the chiefs of a powerful\r\ntribe of Ghat Touaricks, of whom the aged Berka is the reigning Sheikh.\r\nThe giant is quite at home here and possesses some forty or fifty camels,\r\nwith which he conveys the goods of the merchants between this city and\r\nthat of Ghat.\r\n\r\nAfter several trials of changing food, find I am greatly relaxed, and am\r\nconvinced it must be the water. This, however, is the opinion of every\r\nstranger who visits Ghadames. Last evening the Rais said, \"The water here\r\nis bad. Look at the people of Ghadames, they have no colour in their\r\ncheeks. What a miserable wretch am I! When I first came, I had the colour\r\nof the rose; now I am become like these yellow men: as for my poor horse,\r\nhe eats quantities of barley every day, and is still very thin. It's the\r\nbad water. We have a proverb in Turkey, 'Good water makes good horses,\r\nand bad water bad horses.'\" I observed, the dates and water together made\r\nthe soldiers ill. He replied, \"I have written several times to the Pasha\r\nto return, it is impossible for me to enjoy good health here. His\r\nHighness still refuses to allow me, saying, he can get no one to fill my\r\npost so well, but I hope to return in a few months.\" I am inclined to\r\nthink now that Ghadames is not salubrious, although, thank God, I enjoy\r\npretty good health. Strangers, however, require to be acclimated. A great\r\ncontroversy is now being carried on amongst the medical men of Algeria,\r\nrespecting _acclimating_; some alleging that a man can bear the climate\r\nof a country when he is quite new or fresh in it, much better than after\r\na long residence. According to the anti-acclimaters, the longer residence\r\nin a country only weakens the force necessary to support a person against\r\nthe fever and bad influences of a foreign climate.\r\n\r\nAccosted one of my merchant acquaintances, playing with some iron\r\nmanacles and fetters for the legs. It did not strike me at first\r\nwhat they were: at last, he says to me, \"These are for slaves, each\r\nhas a pair of them, to prevent them from escaping when travelling\r\nthrough The Desert.\" A painful shuddering came over me to see a man\r\nplaying with these dreadful instruments of the slavery and torture\r\nof his fellow men. Yet he played with them as his rosary of beads,\r\nor some simple toy! . . . . . Another merchant came up to him, and\r\nobserved, \"The irons for the neck are better, as these may break.\"\r\nAfter a pause, I asked my acquaintance where these irons for the\r\nlegs were made? He replied, \"In Soudan; the people there have iron\r\nmountains, and they make these irons for slaves in that country.\" I\r\nasked him then how much they cost, and whether he would sell them.\r\nThey were not for sale. So Africa enslaves herself! forges the very\r\nchains of her own slavery. Cruel, heartless Europe! Thou that\r\nknowest better, encouragest the wretched African to create his own\r\nmisery; to dig from his dark purple mountains the very iron fetters\r\nof his own slavery! Take care that slavery does not surprise thee in\r\nan hour when thou thinkest not, though thou art never so wise, never\r\nso free! Another Corsican tyrant may come and bind thee down anew in\r\nthe chains of slavery. . . . . . . Making inquiries of the Moors\r\nabout these fetters, they said, (wishing to smooth down the matter,\r\nseeing it was disagreeable to me), \"Only those who seek to escape\r\nare chained.\" This, indeed, afterwards I found was the case. \"Some,\"\r\nthey added, \"have irons on their necks, and others irons on their\r\nlegs.\" Alas! poor people, what have they done to be thus ironed? or\r\nwhat right have others to iron them? Has God said \"_Thou shalt iron\r\nthy brother and make him a slave_?\" \"Yes!\" say the free republicans\r\nof America, who, for being taxed for half an ounce of tea,\r\nproclaimed their _freedom_ and independence of the _tyranny_ of the\r\nparent country, in words which, continuing as they are,\r\nslave-holders, must condemn them to everlasting infamy[47]. But, as\r\nGod lives, he will have a day of reckoning; he will avenge the\r\nwrongs of Africa! . . . . . Be sure, beware America! . . . . .\r\nWhilst walking through the streets to-day, in a bad humour on this\r\nsubject, there were three Bornou youths, nearly naked, offered for\r\nsale, I think they belonged to the Tibboo. Some Arabs sitting near,\r\nasked me to buy. I replied, indignantly, \"If I buy, my Sultan will\r\nhang me up, and you too.\" They stared at one another, and muttered\r\nsomething like a curse upon me.\r\n\r\nI here find several reasons in the journal for my not proceeding by the\r\nroute of Fezzan and Bornou, but it is unnecessary to give them. It is\r\neasy to write out a long list of _pro_ and _con_ reasons. Whilst writing\r\nthese, the Tibboo comes in and brings a sick slave. He complains the\r\nmerchants will not buy his slaves. Give the dropsical slave medicine. Ask\r\nhim whether he ironed his slaves _en route_ over The Desert. He answers,\r\n\"No.\" I am bound to believe him, for though a slave-dealer, he appears an\r\nhonest man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_8th._--O God of the morning! what a fine sight are these lofty\r\numbrageous palms, with the soft serene morning sky, and the sun just\r\nrising above the clear illumined horizon, colouring and setting off the\r\nheavens around. How still, how voiceless is The Desert! The early morn\r\nnow begins to be pleasant as the autumnal morn of old England. It is\r\nindeed, the--\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet hour of prime.\"\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast visited the quarter of Ben Weleed. Saw the giant Touarick\r\nstretching his unwieldy length upon a stone-bench. At sight of me, he\r\naroused himself, and raising his head upon his huge arm, growled out to\r\nthe people near him, to show them his zeal for their common religion,\r\n\"Tell the Christian to say, '_There is only one God, and Mahomet is the\r\nProphet of God_.'\" No one took any notice of the stern command. After a\r\nmoment, the conversation was continued on other subjects, and the giant\r\nfell back again to sleep. I asked an acquaintance of mine, how long he\r\nwould sleep? He told me that whenever the Sheikh comes here, he usually\r\nsleeps three days before he goes round to see his friends, or begins to\r\ntransact business, during which time he occasionally opens his eyes,--and\r\nhis mouth, for his slaves to feed him.\r\n\r\nHeard some Souafah, Arabs of Souf, had purchased the slaves lately come\r\nfrom Bornou, to sell them in Algeria, there being no market in Tunis on\r\naccount of the abolition of slavery. Rais sent for me and asked me if I\r\nhad any money left. I thought his Excellency wanted to lend me some, by\r\nputting the question. His Excellency then said he was in want of money. I\r\nlent him a hundred Tunisian piastres--all the money I had in the world,\r\nwith the exception of seventeen in my pocket. Afterwards I dined with the\r\nRais, and he persuaded me to return to The Mountains, _en route_ for\r\nFezzan. It is reported, the Touaricks have gone out to meet the Shânbah.\r\nI tell the Governor, as well as the people, whenever they begin to\r\nexaggerate or declaim upon the dangers of travelling in The Desert\r\n\"_Rubbee, mout wahad_ (God! death is but once).\" This has usually the\r\neffect of stopping their mouths. Were I not to adopt this Moslemite style\r\nof address and reply, I should be worried out of my life with the\r\nexaggerations of the dangers of The Desert.\r\n\r\nA small caravan has arrived from Souf, bringing the news of the departure\r\nof the Shânbah from Warklah for Ghat. The Souafah also bring news of\r\ninterest from their own country. They are threatened with an invasion of\r\nthe people of Tugurt. Twelve hundred men of Souf have returned from Tunis\r\nto their own country, in expectation of a combined attack of the Tugurt\r\npeople and the French, for the Tugurt people have given out that the\r\nFrench, their new allies, will help them. They boast that they must now\r\ngo and destroy all the Souafah. The object is to revenge an old grudge,\r\nfor formerly the people of Souf and Tugurt fought a pitch battle, and the\r\nlatter were worsted. There is no French governor in Tugurt, but the\r\ntribute is regularly paid to the authorities of Constantina. One of the\r\nSouafah came to me much excited. I told him that it was not likely the\r\nFrench would encourage this war of revenge, and I understood the\r\nprinciple of the French to be, \"to occupy only the countries which before\r\npaid tribute to the Dey of Algiers.\" He observed he understood that to be\r\nthe rule. But if the Souafah attack Tugurt, the French will probably\r\ndefend it as a part of their territory.\r\n\r\n_9th._--The morning is cool and cloudy; a few drops of rain fell\r\nsoon after sunrise, still it holds up. Amused in finding the\r\nGhadamsee word for _father_ was the same as _dad_ or _dady_, which\r\nis written ‮دادا‬ _dada_. This morning the giant Touarick honoured\r\nme with a visit; he had enough to do to get through the doors of my\r\nhouse with his pine-tree spear. He behaved extremely well. I gave\r\nhim sixty paras to buy tobacco. He begged for a whole piastre, but\r\nthinking he would be a customer of this sort again, I thought it\r\nprudent to begin with a little. His giantship swore by all the\r\npowers terrestrial and celestial, that he would escort me from\r\nGhadames to Kanou in perfect safety. I evaded the question by\r\nobserving, (what the Rais had often told me) \"The Rais says the\r\nTouaricks will cut my throat.\" The giant roared, \"_Kitheb_, kitheb,\r\nkitheb, (a lie! a lie! a lie!)\"--and went off furiously threatening\r\nwrath against the Turks. Afterwards I heard of a complaint which the\r\ngiant made against me, saying I had given him this morning a karoob\r\nshort of the half piastre. I was greatly amused at the giant's keen\r\nobservance of this defalcation of my generosity.\r\n\r\nThe Ghadamseeah literally carry out the injunction, \"Take no thought for\r\nthe morrow,\" which will be illustrated in the following conversation.\r\n\r\n\"What do you do for the poor in your country?\"\r\n\r\n\"In England, the poor are not allowed to beg in the streets, but are\r\nprovided with food and clothing in a house built on purpose for them when\r\nthey can no longer work.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no houses for the poor in Ghadames.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then do the poor live?\"\r\n\r\n\"By begging.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the people give them nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is destined _they must die_.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, in one part of the oasis there are some large gardens which\r\nbelong to the poor, who are allowed to eat the dates and cultivate\r\npatches of the gardens. I think also the Sanctuaries sometimes give alms\r\nin the way of the ancient monasteries. These are miserable and precarious\r\nresources. Nevertheless, before the Turks so fleeced the inhabitants, I\r\nquestion if there were any poor person ever likely to die of starvation,\r\nfor the rich members of families provide for the poor, and rich friends\r\nfor poor friends, and each faction for the poor of the faction, although\r\nno poor-rates are levied. Indeed, like the Society of Friends, all took\r\ncare of their own poor relations and connections.\r\n\r\nI shall now give the reader a chapter of the domestic history of\r\nGhadames, referring to one of the principal families. Most of the rich\r\nmerchants of this city have two and some of them three wives. My\r\nvenerable friend, the Sheikh Makouran, came in possession of one of his\r\npresent young wives in the following romantic way. (His wives by whom he\r\nhad his children are long ago dead.) A friend of the Sheikh's died and\r\nleft a young and beautiful widow, whose wit and grace was the theme of\r\nall the city, for such things are esteemed also here. The eldest son of\r\nthe Sheikh immediately set his heart upon the possession of this beauty,\r\nbut unfortunately he did not communicate his intentions to the\r\ndisconsolate lady, who remained in ignorance of his attachment.\r\nMeanwhile, El-Besheer, as a party in the firm of his father, purchased\r\nthe house over the widow's head and made everything ready for the future\r\nwedding, and then took a journey of business to Touat, intending on his\r\nreturn to send some old lady, which is mostly the practice, with his\r\nmessage of love and marriage to the widowed solitary. Perhaps he thought\r\nthe widow could not fail to discover his intentions in what he had\r\nalready done, mostly preliminary to marriage. But we often imagine others\r\nare thinking about us when we are never in their thoughts. So he left for\r\ntwenty days' journey through The Desert, with all these hopes and fears\r\ncrowding about him. On his return, to his consternation, he found his old\r\nfather, of some seventy years of age, had got possession of the young\r\nblooming widow, the object he had so fondly cherished on his weary way\r\nover the solitudes of The Sahara! But like the doomed Pasha, who receives\r\nthe imperial order of his decapitation from the hand of the executioner,\r\nand kisses it and then bows his head to the stroke, so the young\r\nmerchant, full of filial veneration for his aged sire, submitted silently\r\nand without a murmur to this cruel decree of heaven. It is said of the\r\nlady that she pines and mourns out her life for the son. She was kept in\r\nprofound ignorance of his love until she found herself in the withered,\r\ncold, and shrunken arms of the father. She accepted the father to keep a\r\nhouse over her head. Alas! poor woman, whether sold at Paris or London in\r\na marriage of _convenance_, or in The Desert, she is always the victim of\r\nman's galling tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe Ghadamseeah are a strictly religious people. One of my best friends\r\nwould not allow me to touch a religious book of his, concerning the\r\nfuture world, alleging it was _haram_ (\"prohibited\"). A young rogue of a\r\nTouarick now came in and asked me impudently, whether I knew God and\r\nprayed? He added, \"Say Mahomet is the prophet of God.\" As several aged\r\nmen were present I made no answer. These people believe that there can be\r\nno more question of believing in Mahomet than in the sun when shining in\r\nits full strength, and are astonished that I who read and write Arabic\r\ndon't know better. One said, \"You are afraid of scorpions, believe in\r\nMahomet and they will do you no harm.\" I could not help thinking of the\r\nparallel, for all Oriental phraseology is so much alike:--\r\n\r\n  ‮هاهوذا اعطيتكم سلطا نا لتدوسا الحيات والعقارب‬\r\n    Luke x. 21.\r\n\r\n\"Serpents and scorpions\" have a peculiar application to The Desert. There\r\nare still more dangerous animals in The Desert, and I have heard the\r\nepithet of \"a race of vipers,\" applied to the Shânbah banditti. This\r\nmorning the people showed me a wooden figure of a fiddler, placed on a\r\nbox, in which was inserted a handle, turning round and making a squeaking\r\nnoise. None of them could understand what it was. A boy was playing with\r\nit as a toy. They told me, as news, \"This came from the country of the\r\nChristians; it ought not to have been made, it is _haram_.\" All toys of\r\nmen and animals are considered by these rigid Moslems as so many\r\nviolations of the commandment \"Thou shalt not make unto thyself any\r\ngraven image.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to my turjeman there are many _Wahabites_ in this\r\nneighbourhood. Besides Jerbah and its mountains, many Wahabites are found\r\nin the Tripoline districts of Nalout, Kabou, Fessatou, Temzeen and\r\nKeklah. The Ghadamsee people detest them and say; \"The Wahabites will be\r\nthe carriers of the Jews to hell-fire in the next world.\" The Wahabites\r\nassert, there are five orthodox sects, of which they form the fifth, and\r\nhate cordially the other four. Wahabites have great difficulty in eating\r\nwith other Mussulmans, and some refuse absolutely to eat with other than\r\ntheir own sect. Wahabites are very numerous in the oasis of Mezab,\r\nbelonging to Algeria, which is confirmed by the Morocco marabout _El\r\nAïachi_, who made his pilgrimage to Mecca in 1661. The Wahabites of\r\nJerbah are subdivided in the _Abadeeah_, or _The Whites_, who wear a\r\n_white_ scull-cap, in contradistinction from those who wear _red_ caps,\r\nlike most Mussulmans of the coast. Generally the Wahabites differ from\r\nother Mohammedans as to the observance of the _five_ daily prayers. They\r\nalso require that, in the observance of the Ramadan, a person should\r\npurify and wash himself at the hour of the day in which the fast may\r\nbegin. The sub-sect of Abadites will neither eat nor drink from the same\r\nvessel with any other sects. Wahabites in general will not weigh or touch\r\nweights, for fear of doing wrong. Other persons do weighing for them,\r\nthey looking on, like the Jews who will not touch the candle on their\r\nSabbath, and get Mussulman or Christian servants to snuff a candle or\r\ntrim a lamp for them. It seems what is a sin in them, may or may not be a\r\nsin in others.\r\n\r\nMy turjeman is surprised we Christians receive the books of the Jews as\r\nsacred and inspired, and so are many other people. They are quite\r\nastonished when I tell them that Christians esteem the Scriptures of the\r\nJews equally divine with their own. They have a confused notion that the\r\nwhole of the Jewish Scriptures consist of the five books of Moses, which\r\nthey call the _Torat_, and the Psalms of David. Some of them say Abraham\r\nwas not a Jew. I explain to them, that the Christians give a different\r\ninterpretation to the Jewish Scriptures from the Jews themselves, and\r\nbelieve \"the Son of Mary\" to be the Messiah of the Jews and all the\r\nworld. They hardly believe me; and say, \"The Jews are corrupt and their\r\nbooks corrupt.\" When I told them one day before the Rais that we had had\r\nJews in India, they flatly replied it was a lie, for said they, \"It is\r\nimpossible for such a miserable being as a Jew to be a soldier.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[43] Shaving off the hair from different parts of the body is a\r\n    species of religious rite. The barber in North Africa is highly\r\n    esteemed. One of the antiquities in Kairwan (Tunis) is the tomb of\r\n    Mahomet's barber. This city is also the _third_ holy city of the\r\n    Moslemite world, on account of this important personage being\r\n    buried there.\r\n\r\n[44] Ghour, ‮قور‬, _Sterculia acuminata_, Pal. de Beauv.\r\n\r\n[45] He did not know there was a _new_ world before I told him.\r\n\r\n[46] The Moors always add to ‮عيسي‬, (Jesus,) _the son of Mary_,\r\n    to distinguish The Saviour from others of the same name, one of\r\n    whom is Jesus, a marabout, the founder of the Brotherhood of\r\n    Snakecharmers.\r\n\r\n[47] In their \"Declaration of Independence,\" the Anglo-Americans\r\n    say--\"_All men are created equal_,\" and \"_endowed by their Creator\r\n    with certain unalienable rights_;\" and \"_amongst these, life,\r\n    liberty, and the pursuit of happiness_.\" I once met a Naval\r\n    Officer of the United States of America at Gibraltar, who\r\n    graciously told me, \"_Slavery is the support of the country_,\"\r\n    (_his_ country).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED RESIDENCE IN GHADAMES.\r\n\r\n     Celebration of Marriage.--Native Feast of the Slaves.--Study of\r\n     the Negro Languages.--Visit to the Ancient Watch-Tower.--Arrival\r\n     of an Algerian Spy.--Visit to Sidi Mâbed.--Continued Oppression\r\n     of the Ghadamsee People by the Turks.--The Ancient Sheikh\r\n     Ali.--Finances of Algeria.--Bastinading a truant\r\n     School-Boy.--Ceuta sold by the Mahommedans to the Spaniards for a\r\n     Loaf of Bread.--The _Parakleit_ of the New Testament the promised\r\n     Prophet Mahomet.--Tricks of the Algerian Dervish-Spy.--Learn to\r\n     crack Jokes in Arabic.--The sustaining force of Camels' Milk as\r\n     Food.--Depreciation of Women by the Moors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_10th._--A BEAUTIFUL morning, and cool. I saw with some surprise a very\r\nfine red butterfly, also a small flight of good-sized birds passing over\r\nthe gardens.\r\n\r\nThis morning there was a grand gormandizing of bazeen[48], in celebration\r\nof the nuptials of the two daughters of my taleb. The feast was given by\r\nthe fathers of the young men. Nearly the whole of the male population of\r\nthe _Ben Wezeet_, besides strangers and the Arab soldiers, went to dig,\r\nand dip, and dive into the huge bowl of bazeen, some three or four\r\nhundred adults, besides boys. The house was small, and parties entering\r\ntogether were limited to twenty. However, as the object is merely to\r\ncompliment the new married people and their parents, after they had\r\nswallowed half a dozen mouthsful, they immediately retired and left the\r\ncoast clear for the rest, and thus the ceremony was soon got through.\r\nThere was an exception in the case of the soldiers, whose hungry stomachs\r\nfound the bazeen so good that they stuck fast to the bowl, and were\r\nobliged to receive the Irish hint of being pulled away by main force\r\nbefore they would relinquish their tenacious grasp. My taleb, as a matter\r\nof course, called upon me to go to the festa. I found the festive hall to\r\nbe a smallish oblong room, the walls of which were garnished with a\r\nnumber of little looking-glasses, polished brass basons, and various\r\nother small matters, including little baskets made of palm-branches. The\r\nfloor was covered with matting and a few showy carpets, and one or two\r\nottomans were arranged for seats. In the centre of the room was placed an\r\nenormous wooden dish, full of bazeen, or thick boiled pudding, made of\r\nbarley-meal, with olive-oil, and sauce of pounded dates poured upon it.\r\nEvery person ate with his hands, rolling the pudding into balls, and\r\ndipping the balls into oil and date-sauce. A great piece of carpetting\r\nwas laid round the bowl, to be used as a napkin to wipe the hands and\r\nmouth. The wooden dish or bowl might have been three feet in diameter,\r\nand was replenished as fast as emptied with masses of boiled dough, oil,\r\nand date-sauce. There was suspended over it, two or three feet above, a\r\nwicker roof, to prevent the dirt from falling into it when the people\r\nstood up all around and wiped their hands. The visitors squatted down\r\ntogether, encircling the bowl, in numbers of about eight or ten. An Arab,\r\nwho had a lump given him in a corner, like a dog, found fault with it and\r\nreturned it, saying, \"It is not enough.\" This, of course, was delicate,\r\nbut another lump was given him, for which also he growled\r\ndissatisfaction. This _feeding_ of bazeen was the fullest extent of the\r\ngood things of the feast. Some of the more respectable merchants went in\r\nand out without tasting the bazeen, merely paying the compliment to their\r\nfriends. I asked an acquaintance how much he thought a feast of this sort\r\ncost. He replied, \"About twenty dollars, but it is not the value of the\r\nmaterials of the feast, but the custom, which is esteemed.\" Not one of\r\nthe Ben Weleed were present, but all the Wezeet deemed it their duty to\r\nattend the feast. The marriage feast is some eight days after the\r\nmarriage. Last night there was a little firing of matchlocks. After\r\nmarriage, the bridegroom cannot mix with his acquaintances for two or\r\nthree weeks. It is a sort of decamping after marriage, as if the parties\r\nhad done something of which they were ashamed, like in travelling\r\nhoney-moons amongst ourselves. But at certain hours of the day the\r\nbridegroom may be seen gliding about like a spectre in the dark streets,\r\nalone and with noiseless tread. He usually is dressed in gayest colours\r\nof blue and scarlet, with a fine long stave of brass, or a bright iron\r\nspear in his hand. When he is met by any one he instantly vanishes: he\r\ndoes not utter a syllable, and no person attempts to speak to him.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon and evening was also a _native_ feast of the slaves. They\r\nfirst danced and sung in the market-place. Afterwards they visited the\r\n_tombs_, and prayed to their dead relatives, propitiating their manes,\r\nand \"to be restored to them and liberty at their death.\" The women\r\ncarried chafing-dishes in their hands, on which burnt fragrantly the\r\nincense of _bekhour_. The pride of men perpetuate their distinctions\r\nbeyond life to the land of the dead, where one would think the ashes of\r\nthe human body should be allowed freely to return to the essential\r\nelements of our common mother, Earth. So slaves have their place of\r\nburial, and must not commingle their bones with those of freemen. From\r\nthe grave-yard and its sadness, the slaves proceeded to a garden, alotted\r\nto them, where they danced, and sung, and forgot their slavery. Besides\r\ndancing and singing, the slaves occasionally fired off matchlocks, which\r\nthey had borrowed from their masters or friends, and of which they are\r\nmost immoderately fond. The high military chivalry of Europe, and France,\r\nwho calls herself _mère de l'épée_, are well matched by the savage tribes\r\nand slaves of enslaved Africa, who all delight in the slash and cut of\r\nthe sword, and the banging noise of the gun. The negresses sat apart, as\r\nusual, occasionally raising their shrill _loo-looings_, which they have\r\nwell learnt from their Moorish mistresses. They were very gaily attired,\r\nsome with their arms covered with bracelets and armlets, six or seven\r\npairs of very broad tin or silver hoops being fitted on or encircling one\r\nsingle arm; so that the arms of some of these sable beauties were an\r\nentire mass of metal. The party mustered about a hundred, and the Tibboo\r\nstranger was here, attracted by the colour of skin and native\r\nassociations. Several people went from the city to see the slaves'\r\nfestival--I amongst the rest. It would be great injustice if I were not\r\nto add, that the Moorish inhabitants of Ghadames ordinarily treat their\r\nslaves well; they have a good deal of leisure, if not liberty; and their\r\nlot, as compared with the slaves of the cotton and sugar plantations of\r\nChristians, _is liberty itself_,--so differently do religions affect, or\r\nnot affect at all, the morality of the people who profess them. To judge\r\nfrom this obvious case of comparison, which is so notorious through all\r\nThe East and North Africa, as contrasted with the Christian States of\r\nAmerica, the religion of the impostor of Mecca should be the religion of\r\nthe divine morals of the New Testament, and the religion of The Saviour\r\nbe the corrupt morals of the Koran. But if we were to judge of a religion\r\nand its morals from those who profess it, our ideas would soon get into\r\nconfusion, and we should fall into the most deplorable errors.\r\n\r\nBegan to-day to acquire a few words of the Nigritian languages. People\r\nare such geese, that when I learnt half-a-dozen words of what some call\r\nthe \"_black_\" language, they thought me a prodigy. The Housa is the best\r\nand most frequently spoken language here of the Nigritian tongues. A New\r\nTestament, translated into this language, would or could be read by a\r\nthird of the tribes of Central Africa. Asking my negro master what _I_\r\nwas, he replied, \"_Kerdee_,\" which means _kafer_ (\"infidel\") in Bornou,\r\nthe negro mistaking my individual self for the pronoun _I_, which is\r\n_oomah_. I laughed heartily at the fellow's impudence.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon, visited the ancient tower, about half a mile distant,\r\nwestwards, from the walls of Ghadames. My turjeman, who was _cicerone_,\r\ninformed me that the tower was built by the Christians, and was a\r\nwatch-tower to give alarm to the city in case of an attack from banditti\r\nor other enemies. There is another like it in the mountains to the\r\nnorth-west, where are also scattered some old masonry of other buildings.\r\nWe mounted the top of the tower, and found a hollowed space at the top,\r\nof this shape--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\ntwenty feet long, eight broad, and about five deep. It was evidently a\r\ncistern or tank for the troops, for we saw a hole at the broad end, from\r\nwhich the water ran out. The tower itself was about forty feet in\r\ndiameter. How high it had been, we could not now tell; but the cistern is\r\nplaced nearly at the top of what remains of the tower. Probably the water\r\nran down into the lower rooms. From the tops of the ruins there was a\r\ncommanding view of the oasis, and the surrounding Desert. On our way we\r\npassed a very deep, dry well, and the wall-remains of several ancient\r\ngardens. The turjeman says the water of Ghadames diminishes, and was\r\nformerly much more abundant.\r\n\r\n_11th._--This morning cooler than any yet. My eyes are now nearly\r\nrestored from the attack of ophthalmia which I had in Tripoli; they open\r\nalways with a little pain in the morning. It is frightful to observe how\r\nmany people here have their eyes injured. A poor camel-driver said to me,\r\n\"Alas! since I went that road to Ghat, I have been nearly blind. The sand\r\nand rock were too bright for them.\"\r\n\r\nAn Algerine Arab arrived with those of Souf, a species of vagrant\r\nmarabout, bringing with him all the lax liberal ideas of French\r\nMussulmans. I thought at first he had been sent as a spy, to see what I\r\nmyself was doing at Ghadames. The pious Ghadamseeah were confounded at\r\nhis discourses, as he held forth in the streets. He was very clever and\r\nfacetious, now and then affecting the saint--now the reformer. When he\r\nwas gone, I asked the people what they thought of him. They replied,\r\n\"He's spoilt--he's a _French_ Mussulman--he'll soon be an infidel.\"\r\nOthers said, \"He's mad.\" This stranger brings the news that all is peace\r\nin Algeria. One of the people asked him, \"Whether it was really true that\r\nthe French had got so far into the interior as Constantine?\" The Algerine\r\nsays also, Abdel-Kader is escaped to The Desert. The Emir had been at war\r\nwith the French during the summer. My taleb, speaking of the French,\r\nobserved, \"Buonaparte had no father.\" I endeavoured in vain to persuade\r\nhim to the contrary; and pressing him to tell me under whose influence he\r\nwas begotten, he at last said, \"You think I'm a fool, but his father was\r\none of the Jenoun (\"demons\").\" This is rather a good ancestry, for the\r\nJenoun are, on the whole, a harmless, pleasant sort of people, a\r\ndisposition which the war-loving tyrant Corsican rarely showed.\r\n\r\n_12th._--Rose earlier than usual, before sunrise, in order to go to the\r\nmarabet[49] of Sidi-Mâbed--‮سيدي مَع٘بد‬. My turjeman had\r\nmarried his wife from this place, and therefore accompanied me. He\r\nsaid, \"I married one of the daughters of the Saint, and his blood\r\nruns in the veins of my children.\" In all The Desert we find this\r\naristocracy of the gentle blood of the Saints. Sidi-Mâbed is two\r\nmiles and a half from Ghadames due west. It is situate upon the\r\nslope of a small valley, which might formerly have been the bed of a\r\nriver. To look at this speck of an oasis, its appearance is not\r\nunlike that of Seenawan. Around, and near the little village, which\r\nmay consist of some fifteen very lowly dwellings, is a cluster of\r\npalms, and further on are two or three single ones, scattered over\r\nthe sloping valley. At the furthest distance are some patches of\r\ncultivation, the water running gurgling down to them. The gardens\r\nare of the same character as those of Ghadames. The inhabitants\r\nconsist of some seventy souls, all the descendants of one man, the\r\nfamous saint who has given his name to the village. But according to\r\nthe account of his sons, his offspring has not increased very fast,\r\nfor it is several hundred years,--even 900 say they--since His\r\nMaraboutship flourished. Some place him as far back as the Flood. It\r\nis said that Nimroud did not place his iron hoof on this sacred\r\nspot. The daughters of the Saint marry away, only the sons remain in\r\nthe oasis, and some of these emigrate, which accounts for the\r\nsmallness of the Saint's offspring.\r\n\r\nThe children of this Saint, like many a saint himself, are very ignorant,\r\nand only one of them pretends to read and write, and to-day he was\r\nunfortunately not in the oasis. Those with whom I conversed were simple\r\nrude peasants, but polite in their manners, with countenances speaking a\r\nserenity of soul and happiness of disposition, not common to the\r\ninhabitants of the Saharan regions. They told me their village was\r\n_Zaweea_ (\"a sanctuary\"), and was recorded in the sacred archives of\r\nConstantinople as one of the most renowned places in the countries of the\r\nProphet. It is, at any rate, one of the most venerated sanctuaries in the\r\nSahara, and receives pious offerings from all. Amidst wars and tumults,\r\nand the depredations of banditti without and around, it remains secure\r\nand inviolate and inviolable. This has been its happy destiny through\r\nages, and the villagers, poor and ignorant as they are, may be proud of\r\ntheir sacred unpolluted home. We have here a remarkable instance of the\r\ntriumph of religious principle over brute force. The people of Ghadames\r\nmake continual pilgrimages to the shrine of the Saint. The villagers\r\nbrought our party dates, and all the women and children came out to look\r\nat me; the same jealous feelings do not exist amongst these unsuspecting\r\nuntutored people as in Ghadames and other Desert cities. A happy thought\r\noccurred to me before I came away in the morning, of bringing them some\r\nwedding-cakes and sweets which had been sent to me: these I brought, with\r\nseveral loaves of bread. They received them very gratefully, dividing\r\nthem among the whole population of seventy people, a morsel for each.\r\nThey have no wheaten bread here; they live not on the \"fat of the land,\"\r\nas the Christian poverty-vowing monks of our own and past times. These\r\nDesert saints are content with a scanty supply of barley-meal, a little\r\nolive-oil, and a few dates. I had been told they did not approve of\r\nholding _Ben-Adam_ as slaves, and was greatly disappointed to hear a\r\nreply from one of them, \"If we had money we would have slaves; we have no\r\nslaves, because we have no money.\" By the way, the poverty of North\r\nAfrica and The Sahara is one of the principal causes of the few domestic\r\nslaves now kept, in comparison with former times.\r\n\r\nWhen we had been in the village a few minutes, an Arab soldier came\r\nhastily after us. He was sent by the Rais, who was frightened out of his\r\nwits, his Excellency giving out, that I should be attacked by banditti.\r\nHis Excellency said, on my return, \"_Why, why?_ (apparently displeased,\r\nmany people being with him,) whenever you go out, come to me, and I will\r\ngive you an armed Arab soldier.\" He added; \"You and I will go and see the\r\nZaweea on horseback.\" The fact is, some of the people were jealous of a\r\nChristian going to their sacred village, and considered it a pollution,\r\nand the Rais was obliged to make a show of opposition and displeasure.\r\nThe children of the Saint manifested none of these exclusive jealous\r\nfeelings, and were happy to see me. In the course of an hour, though my\r\nturjeman and myself came off early and secretly, it was known all over\r\nthe city the Christian had gone to the sanctuary, and the more bigoted\r\nwere not a little excited. In the village, although everything has the\r\nappearance of the most abject poverty, all is bright and clean. The tomb\r\nof the Saint remains, but is concealed from the world, enveloped in\r\nprofound mystery, suitable to the exciting of superstitious feelings. In\r\nthe gardens were many pretty butterflies. I noticed a single cotton-tree,\r\nand gathered two or three ripe pods; the tree looked unhealthy and was\r\nvery dwarfish. The Sahara is not the place for cotton growing; formerly,\r\nhowever, cotton was grown at Carthage, the Jereed, and other parts of\r\nNorth Africa. Sir Thomas Reade has lately tried cotton-growing on the\r\nlands of Carthage, but not succeeded very well. We went to see the\r\ndate-trees, and seeing one a mere bush, without a trunk, I said; \"How\r\nlong has that been so, will it ever bear dates?\" A son of the Saint said;\r\n\"That tree has been there as long as I can remember. It was always so.\r\nDate-trees are like mankind, some are tall, some are dwarfish, some fat,\r\nsome lean, some bear fruit and others are barren. The root descends into\r\nthe earth as low as the length of a man. God created this place and gave\r\nus this garden. We and our children shall keep it until the Judgment-day!\r\nFrom this garden we shall ascend to that of paradise, where we shall have\r\ndates always ripe and ready for eating, for every tree is large and\r\nfruitful there. And no man dare touch these trees without our permission,\r\nnot even the Rais or the Bashaw. We pay nothing to any man; all cast\r\nbefore us their offerings. But we have little because we want little.\r\nSuch is the will of God.\" Here then is the abode of inviolate sanctity!\r\nhere sits the protecting genius of Ghadames, like a pelican in the\r\nwilderness! I observed again to-day the burnt volcanic stones scattered\r\nover The Desert. They were of all colours, yellow, black, brown, and red,\r\nlike so many brick-bats. These stones scattered for miles around,\r\ntogether with the hot-spring of the city, and many of the low dull\r\nSaharan hills, like so many heaps of scoriæ and lava, give apparently a\r\nvolcanic origin to all these regions, or render such a supposition\r\nprobable.\r\n\r\nIn full Divan it was decided this morning to clear out a little the\r\nhot-spring and its ducts running to the gardens, in order to give the\r\nflow of water more room. Some old people say their fathers cleaned it\r\nout, and the water ran more abundantly; the deeper their fathers dug the\r\nwell, the more the water gushed out. Others are opposed to the\r\ninnovation, opposed to all change, being the good old Tories of the\r\nSaharan city. All the people are to go in a few days and set to work at\r\nthis cleaning, that means their slaves. Went to see this evening a sick\r\nTouarick, out of town in his tent, and gave him some medicine; but shall\r\nbe obliged to leave off distributing soon, for the most useful medicines\r\nare nearly all finished.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Weather becomes daily cooler. Get tired of writing, and wish to\r\nbe off in The Desert. A courier from The Mountains has arrived, bringing\r\na note from Ahmed Effendi, who says, \"The people of Ghadames have no\r\noccasion to send a deputation to Tripoli. They must pay the extraordinary\r\ndemand of 3,000 mahboubs at once, without farther dispute or delay.\"\r\nPeople are in consternation; they all say they've no more money. My taleb\r\nassures me he was obliged to sell two of his shirts to make up the last\r\namount of the regular tax. What is to be done for extraordinary demands?\r\nThe fortifications of _Emjessem_ are to be immediately rebuilt. The mud\r\nand salt walls are to be destroyed, and new ones of stone and lime are to\r\nreplace them. Rais showed me the plan of the fonduk, which was nearly\r\nexecuted. This looks like perseverance on the part of the Turks, and\r\nshows their determination to keep open the communication between this and\r\nTripoli. The fonduk, or caravanseria, will be eighty feet long and thirty\r\nwide. It is to be built by the people of Ghadames, who, whilst working,\r\nwill be protected by sixty Arab troops. The expense to be also paid by\r\nGhadames. Rais is going to see the works begin. Besides the new fonduk,\r\nRais has taken the precaution of stopping up a well, a day's journey\r\nnorth-east from the city, by rolling into it a huge stone. This is for\r\nthe same object, to prevent brigands coming near the city and lying in\r\nwait for small caravans and isolated travellers. Fifty sheep were brought\r\ninto Souk to-day; they were immediately sold. People fatten them for the\r\n_Ayd-Kebir_, each family endeavouring to procure one as a religious\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n_14th._--Went early this morning to _Ben Weleed_ to find my aged friend,\r\nSheikh Ali. He has the largest species of dates, and invited me to go to\r\nhis garden to see the palms.\r\n\r\nSheikh Ali is a man of ancient days, and ancient honour and resources,\r\nand fallen into a very low estate. He has not only outlived his age and\r\nreputation, but outlived his wealth and riches and has become \"poor\r\nindeed.\" A long flowing white beard now covers his receding breast, and\r\nthe wrinkles of ninety years furrow his pale brow and sunken cheeks.\r\nNevertheless, dignity, though ruined, is stamped on his countenance, and\r\nan almost youthful activity and hale health keep up the great burden of\r\nhis years. On arriving at the old man's garden, he told me to follow him,\r\nand coming to a very fine lofty palm, with over-hanging wide-spreading\r\nboughs, he sat down under its ample shade, and bade me sit by his side.\r\n\"Christian,\" he said, \"I have sat under the shade of this palm all the\r\ndays of my life, and shall recline here till God summons me hence.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old are the longest-lived palms?\" I returned.\r\n\r\n\"More than the ages of three old men's lives,\" observed the Sheikh.\r\n\r\nAn old slave, as ancient-looking as his master, now brought a basket of\r\ndates, they were every one of them larger than our largest walnuts. I am\r\nvexed I have forgotten the name of this splendid variety of the date.\r\n\"Eat,\" said Sheikh Ali, and reclined back in silence for at least half an\r\nhour. Now and then he opened his eyes to look on the autumnal beams of\r\nthe rising sun, then breathed a sigh and a prayer, but did not address me\r\na word. His ancient slave sat at a distance with his eyes fixed on his\r\nbeloved master, watching the movement of his lips, as he breathed his\r\nmorning prayer. At length, seeing the old man's lips cease to move, I\r\nsaid gently:--\r\n\r\n\"Sheikh Ali, they say you have broken down very much, but I am glad to\r\nsee you confide your sorrows in the bosom of God.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--(Awakening up suddenly, and looking at me anxiously) \"Ah,\r\nChristian, have they told you so? The detractors, the wretches!\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust I have not offended you.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"No, stranger, no. But I hate them. I hate the world. I\r\ncurse the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"The unfortunate and disappointed are always bitter upon the world. But\r\nyou, Sheikh Ali, I know are above spite and malignity: you would not\r\nstoop even to hate the miserable follies of the world.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"Christian, thou talkest well, and in my way. I tell thee\r\nI hate no one, I have lived and I shall soon be done with the world. May\r\nthose who come after me fare better.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this hatred of the Ben Weleed and the Ben Wezeet?\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--(Smiling faintly.) \"Christian, thou wilt know everything.\r\nMy father told me when I came out of the belly of my mother, that I was a\r\n_Ben Wezeelee_, and I have remained so to this day. But why or wherefore,\r\nI know not? Dost thou not see that people do this and that, and know not\r\nwhy they do it? Well, Christian, we do not hate the Ben Wezeet; but we\r\nwill not associate with them, because we are proud, and because our\r\nfathers did not associate with them. It is pride, not hatred, which\r\ndivides this our nation into two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so proud? It says in the Koran the Devil would not admire Adam for\r\npride[50], and God cursed him for his pride.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"Ah, Christian, how knowest thou the Koran? Canst thou\r\nread the Great and Mighty Koran?\"\r\n\r\n\"In England we read the Koran in order to obtain a correct knowledge of\r\nclassic Arabic. Others read it to understand the religion of Moslems.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"Right, right. The Christians are a wise people. Oh, these\r\nreligions!\"\r\n\r\nI thought I heard a regret of scepticism, or a kindly view of heretics\r\nand infidels, in the latter exclamation, \"_Oh, these religions!_\" So I\r\nobserved to the Sheikh, \"A pity it is we are not all of one religion, as\r\nwe are all the children of one Creator.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"By G----! Christian, thou art right. I have always prayed\r\nGod to lead me in the right way, and to have mercy upon others. But do\r\nyou know, Christian, I think there were amongst those prophets of ancient\r\ntimes many impostors. What do you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it. It is also the opinion of all our wise men in England.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"Christian, I hate Marabouts. In the long years of my life\r\nI have seen all their tricks, lies, and impositions. I am sorry for the\r\npoor people, on whom they practise their impostures, and also for the\r\nwomen. I have one daughter; I never permitted her to consult a marabout.\r\nI told her what the wretches were. Have you marabouts in England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of all descriptions. We have also many who get the women to confess\r\nthe secrets of families, and create an odious war in the bosom of\r\nsociety.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"Ah, ah (chuckling), all the world's alike. God curse\r\nthose marabouts. Do you give them money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Money! In our country, nothing is done without money.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--(Becoming fresh excited.) \"What! are the English like us?\r\nis a man esteemed for his money?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have heard of London?\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"_Londra?_\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's it. Well, in Londra, nor virtue, nor honour, nor wisdom, is\r\nworth anything without money.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Ali._--\"The Devil take the world, it's all alike. So here, so\r\nthere. When I was rich, everybody bowed down to me; now that I am poor,\r\nthey pass me by without saying _bis-slamah_ (saluting). Why did God make\r\nmoney? How wretched is the world.\" So this philosopher of The Desert\r\ncontinued. Returning, I bade the ancient Sheikh an affectionate adieu.\r\n\r\nIn the streets, people appeared to be fasting, as in the most rigid\r\nRamadan. I never saw such gloomy, emaciated faces. Really people look as\r\nif they were all going to give up the ghost. What is to become of these\r\npoor devils of dervishes! Government is grinding them down to the dust!\r\nReturned home heart-sick at the sight. I am growing daily more impatient\r\nof remaining so long in Ghadames. Impatience comes on like attacks of\r\nfever. Have determined again to pursue the Kanou route.\r\n\r\nThe forty slaves brought by the Touaricks and the Tibboo have been all\r\nsold to the Souafah. The Tibboo sold his for twenty dollars per head. The\r\nten dollars per head tax on them put the Rais in possession of a little\r\nready money, and his Excellency paid me back the hundred Tunisian\r\npiastres. The Arabs of Souf always bring money here, and, besides\r\ndollars, a quantity of five-franc pieces, since the French have occupied\r\nAlgeria. The millions spent or wasted by the French in Algeria are\r\nvariously disposed of:--\r\n\r\n1st.--The Arabs get a _fifth_, who bury their money, or send it into the\r\nneighbouring deserts of Tunis and Morocco.\r\n\r\n2nd. The Maltese ship off a _ninth_ of the money to Malta. The Spaniards\r\nand other foreigners also get a share.\r\n\r\n3rd. A great quantity, a fifth, perhaps, is embezzled by the _employés_\r\nof the civil administration, and their creatures, the contractors.\r\n\r\n4th. A tenth is spent on the public works.\r\n\r\n5th. The rest is paid to the military. A _fraction_ only is spent on the\r\nculture of the soil, and for the purposes of emigration, or the real\r\ncolonization of the country.\r\n\r\n_15th._--This morning is really cold, and the coldest morning we have had\r\nyet. Rais assures me I shall with difficulty be able to bear the cold, so\r\nintense is it in Ghadames during the winter, or January and February.\r\nGreatly agitated about my journey in the past night, and could not sleep.\r\nThere will soon be an end of this uncertainty. I pray God to give me\r\npatience and wisdom. Observe people are beginning to feel the effects of\r\nthe cold, and cover up their mouths like the Italians and Spaniards. But\r\nall are living up to the starvation-point.\r\n\r\nAt noon was held a full Divan, to decide upon the \"extraordinary demand.\"\r\nThe chiefs of the people said:--\"We have no money, and cannot pay.\" The\r\nRais replied:--\"Such discourse will not do; you have money, and must\r\npay.\" Then the Divan broke up without farther palavering. The alleged\r\nobject of the money to be raised, is for the expenses of the troops who\r\nwent in pursuit of the Arabs of the son of Abd-el-Geleel in the past\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nThe old bandit calls and says:--\"Your friend, the _long_ man, has\r\nfinished to-day all his tobacco.\" The long man is the Giant Touarick. I\r\ntook no notice of this polite hint to furnish a new supply. I might\r\nfurnish with tobacco all the Touaricks who came here, if I were to\r\nattend to these Irish hints. The old bandit, who is cramped up like a\r\nwizened apple, is said by people still to carry on his nefarious trade.\r\nThe proof of this they give to be, his always _going alone_ when he\r\ntravels. The old villain then catches what he can. Myself, I hardly\r\nbelieve he continues his brigandage. He appears wholly worn out. I gave\r\nhis little son 20 paras to buy camel's flesh. The old freebooter grinned\r\na ghastly smile. Walking in _Ben Weleed_ quarters, I heard a great to-do,\r\nand went to see what it was, when I saw the old chief, Haj Ben Mousa\r\nEttanee, standing over his young truant son, whilst with a thick stick\r\nthe servant of the schoolmaster was belabouring the feet of the child.\r\nNever was a more complete bastinadoing. The urchin cried to his father\r\nfor mercy. It was perfectly in character with the old man, and the\r\naustere manners of his family. I do not wonder that all the people read\r\nand write in Ghadames, when such severity is practised by the very\r\naristocrats of the city. Whilst standing by, another Moor went up to the\r\nold man, and said, \"Stop, stop, here's the Christian looking on.\" They\r\nstopped, but it appeared a mere pretence for leaving off, for already\r\nthey had unmercifully belaboured the truant.\r\n\r\nNo mutton to be had to-day, and was obliged to buy camel's flesh for\r\ndinner: found it pretty good. My turjeman and taleb both joined me.\r\nAfter dinner, the taleb began in his usual controversial spirit. He\r\ninsisted, that \"Any person who should make himself well acquainted\r\nwith the Koran must become a Mussulman.\" \"If the French teach their\r\nchildren to read the Koran, in order to learn the Arabic,\" said he,\r\n\"they must conquer the Russians and the English.\" Not \"εν τουτω\r\nνιχα[51],\" but in or with _This Book_, say the Mussulmans, the\r\nworld must be conquered. The Russians and the French, having\r\nrecently made conquests in Mohammedan countries near them, (for the\r\nwars in Circassia are heard of here,) impress these people with\r\nfear, and fear is their ruling principle of government. Asking my\r\ntaleb why the Mussulmans who had possession of _This Book_ did not\r\nconquer the world, he answered sharply, \"The Mussulmans conquered\r\nthe world once with the Koran, but now they have lost their faith,\r\nand are weak, and such is the will of God.\" The taleb then related a\r\ncurious story about Ceuta. A certain marabout, who had seen the _Elouh\r\nElmahfouth_ (‮الوح المحفوظ‬,) or \"Book of Fate,\" which\r\nwas let down to him to look at and read in, from heaven, went into the\r\ncity, and offered Ceuta for sale at the low price of \"_a loaf of\r\nbread_.\" The people said:--\"Oh, the man is mad, let him go.\" But he\r\ncontinued the more to cry out, \"Who will give me a loaf of bread for\r\nCeuta?\" At last he met a Christian, a Spaniard, who gave the\r\nMarabout a loaf of bread, and took possession of the city. This\r\nseems really an excuse for the loss of that strong fortress. But it\r\nis added:--\"The Marabout having seen and read the future destiny of\r\nCeuta in the _Book of Fate_, was determined to hasten the crisis,\r\nand placed it at once in the hands of the Christians.\" My taleb\r\nassures me that Mahomet was foretold and promised in our gospels,\r\nunder the name of _Parakleit_, (_i. e._ ὁ Παράκλητος,), \"The\r\nComforter.\" He cited also the Koran, but would not write the\r\npassage; I had no Koran with me. But this is an advantage, for if I\r\nhad had a Koran in my possession, I should only have excited the\r\nprejudices of the people against me, and should not have been able\r\nto have kept it from them. A traveller might take a translation\r\nadvantageously, one without Arabic notes, or _Arabic_ words\r\nexplained, which would soon excite their curiosity to know what it\r\nwas. Speaking of the \"_Ben Welleed_\" and \"_Wezeet_,\" my turjeman\r\nsaid:--\"These are the French and the English; we are always at war\r\nwith one another.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the opinion of people here, that the French and English are always\r\nat war, and they are continually on the _qui-vive_ for a war breaking out\r\nbetween France and England, for they think then the English will drive\r\nout the French from Algeria, unmindful of what miseries such a war would\r\nentail upon themselves, crushed as they would be between the two great\r\nhostile Powers.\r\n\r\nThe Algerine dervish is playing off some fine tricks. This afternoon he\r\ngot together a dozen low fellows of the Ben Weleed, and went to say the\r\n_fatah_ before the Governor. This saying _fatah_ was chiefly forming a\r\ncircle with his troop, himself in the middle, and then at the top of his\r\nvoice singing out, whilst his troop cried out, \"_hhahh_,\" jumping up, and\r\nbending forward their heads and bodies towards him. This they continued\r\nfor an hour or more, until they sank upon the floor with exhaustion.\r\nAfterwards they played off some other genteel tricks. His Excellency the\r\nRais is as great a dervish as any mad fellow here, and though suffering\r\ngreatly from headache and bad eyes, he endured this tomfoolery for nearly\r\na couple of hours. My taleb, a shrewd man, said to me, \"Don't you see, I\r\ntold you this Algerian was an impostor?\" I believe really he is a French\r\nspy on the movements of the Turks, and perhaps myself. The Tibboo calls.\r\nHe is preparing to depart, and presses me to go with him. Speaking to a\r\nTouarick, he said, \"See the money of the Christians (taking hold of my\r\nblack buttons).\" Many people have half a mind to believe my black buttons\r\nare money. The Tibboo says, there are no watches in Soudan. People are\r\ncontent to measure time by the sun's rising and setting. Some merchants,\r\nlately come from Tunis, have heard of the projected aërial machine. They\r\nhave no difficulty in believing that Christians travel in the air. They\r\nthink the Devil, being very clever, teaches Christians all these things.\r\nThe _Touatee_ calls, and says, \"You must write something.\" \"What?\" I\r\nanswer. \"Oh,\" he replies, \"My wife has a head full of fantazia (or\r\nnonsense); this you must write.\" It appears the Touatee has got a\r\nscolding wife. Told the Rais about this funny incident, who said, \"Tell\r\nthe _Touatee_ to go home and pretend he's going to take another wife, and\r\nthen she'll soon leave off pouting.\"\r\n\r\n_16th_ and _17th._--Continues cold. People say I improve in Arabic. I\r\nought, for I have enough of it. What is odd, I begin to joke with the\r\npeople. It will be seen I have represented the Saharan people as mostly\r\ngloomy, and suffering from the oppression of their Government. Still\r\nthere are times when they can force a smile, or crack a joke. They carry\r\nthe joke so far that they have sometimes joked me about my fasting in\r\nRamadan, a very sacred subject for a Mussulman. Every time I go into the\r\nstreets, I meet with one or other with whom I try to get up a joke, for\r\nit grieves me to see the people suffer so much from bad government. After\r\nwe come to satire, and with the help of the word _batel_,\r\n\"good-for-nothing,\" we manage to hit off somebody. An Arab Sheikh came to\r\nus, one day, when we were joking. I said, \"Oh! here's the lion-heart, who\r\nran away from Emjessem for fear of the _Shânbah-Bātel_.\" The Arab,\r\nastounded, \"Ya rajel (Oh man), I had nothing to eat!\" \"Nor have we here,\"\r\nreplied a merchant, \"you better go and hunt with the greyhounds of the\r\nTouaricks. The Rais has taken away all our victuals.\" The poor Arab went\r\nhis way very queer and crestfallen.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to a Moor of The Sahara, I said, \"The Sahara is always healthy:\r\nlook at these Touaricks, they are the children of The Desert.\" He\r\nreplied, \"The Sahara is the sea _on land_, and, like sea, is always more\r\nhealthy than cultivated spots of the earth. These Touaricks are chiefly\r\nstrong and powerful from drinking camels' milk[52]. They drink it for\r\nmonths together, often for four or five months, not eating or drinking\r\nanything else. After they have drank it some time, they have no\r\nevacuations for four or five days, and these are as white as my bornouse.\r\nIt is the camels' milk which makes the Touaricks like lions. A boy shoots\r\nup to manhood in few years; and there's nothing in the world so\r\nnourishing as camel's milk.\" Caillié mentions that the chief of the\r\nBraknas lived for several months on nothing but milk; but it was cow's\r\nmilk. Many of the Saharan tribes are supported for six months out of\r\ntwelve on milk.\r\n\r\nThe Moors seem to have a secret dislike for women, as well as a most\r\nobstinate desire to tyrannize over them. There is a lurking desire of\r\nthis sort in the men-sex of all countries. Are we not the Lords of\r\nCreation? I actually get afraid of avowing to them that the supreme ruler\r\nof England is _a woman_, they are so confoundedly annoyed at the\r\ncircumstance. The first questions of their surprise are, \"How? Why?\" &c.\r\nMy taleb is very fond of supporting the doctrine of a woman having only a\r\n_fifth_ of her father's property. I annoy him by telling him it's a bad\r\nlaw, and that the daughter should have an equal share with the son. Lady\r\nMorgan is sadly wanted here; she would find ample additional materials\r\nfor a second edition of \"Woman and her Master.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[48] _Bazeen_, ‮بزين‬, called also _Aseedah_, ‮عصيدة‬.\r\n\r\n[49] Some have endeavoured to distinguish in English the mausoleum\r\n    in which a dead saint is laid by the term Mara_bet_, though in\r\n    Arabic both the dead and living saint, and the cupola house in\r\n    which the dead saint is laid, are all called Mara_bout_. When a\r\n    village or town, is built round the mausoleum of a saint, it is\r\n    also called after the saint, as in the instance now related.\r\n\r\n[50] \"We (God) created you, and afterwards formed you (mankind);\r\n    and then said unto the angels, _Worship_ Adam; and they worshipped\r\n    him, except Eblis (The Devil), who was not one of those who\r\n    worshipped. God said unto him, What hindered thee from worshipping\r\n    Adam, since I had commanded thee? He answered, I am more excellent\r\n    than he: thou hast created me of fire, and has created him of\r\n    clay.

Good-bye flies\r\nand good-bye scorpions. Can now write with my door open, without being\r\ncovered with flies. Can also sleep without waking up at midnight to kill\r\nscorpions running over the mattresses. The mad black dervish is always in\r\nmotion, and full of gaiety. People are so fond of him that they think he\r\nis inspired. When all the Moors are in solemn vacant thought, or brooding\r\nover their griefs, or dreaming in broad day of their being marabouts or\r\nsultans, the poor witless thing runs in amongst them, shaking hands with\r\nthe first he meets with, and bursts out a-laughing. He usually succeeds\r\nin infusing a little of his cheerfulness into these equally _mad_ people,\r\nbut more sober in their method of madness. Yesterday the slaves had\r\nanother feast _for the dead_. The Moors allow their slaves the liberty of\r\nblending the two religions, as Rome has allowed the blending of\r\nChristianity and paganism. And when questioned about it they say; \"Oh,\r\nthe slaves know only a little of Allah, and are not much better than\r\ndonkeys in their understandings.\" The slaves assembled to the number of\r\nsome fifty in the Souk. Here they performed a species of walking dance,\r\nin two right lines, very slow and very stiff and measured, having\r\nattached to it some mysterious meaning. They were gaily dressed, attended\r\nwith a drum and iron castanets, making melodious noises. Each had a\r\nmatchlock slung at his back. The women carried a chafing-dish of incense,\r\nas if about to raise some spirit or ghost. A crowd was around them; but\r\nthey performed nothing but this slow-marching dance, and then retired to\r\nthe tombs. The dervish, poor fellow, mingled in the gay throng,\r\nshouldering a stick for a gun.\r\n\r\nReceived many little presents from people lately. Sheikh Makouran brought\r\nme himself a small basket of very fine dates. My taleb afterwards brought\r\nme some _gharghoush_, or small cakes, made of flour, honey, sugar, and\r\nmilk. They are extremely pleasant eating and a little _acid_, which adds\r\ngreatly to their flavour. There are but few things acid in this country;\r\nof sour things there is an abundance.\r\n\r\nHeard a great deal about the Foullans, Foulahs, and Fellatahs, the\r\npredominant race in Soudan. _Foullan_ (‮فلّان فلّانين\r\nفلّاني‬) is the Soudanic term, _Fellatah_ the Bornouese, and\r\n_Foulah_ what is used to denominate them among the Mandingoes. According to\r\ninformation here, they were once the most miserable race of _Arab_\r\nwanderers in The Desert. But at last they settled down as neighbours\r\nto the Negroes, some 700 years since. They continued to increase in\r\nnumbers and importance, abandoning tents and building villages and\r\ntowns, and intermixing with the Negroes, till about forty-five (and\r\nothers thirty-five) years ago, when they expanded their ideas to\r\nconquest and renown. About this time they made the conquest of\r\nKanou, Succatou, and the other large cities of Housa. Never a people\r\nrose to greater fame and power. They were assisted, like the\r\nSaracens before them, by religious fanaticism, and so far\r\ncorresponded with them, in extending the boundaries of Islamism.\r\nThey went on conquering and to conquer till within the present year,\r\nwhen their power received some check by the daring exploits of the\r\nTibboo prince of Zinder, a vassal of Bornou. This prince has taken\r\nfrom them a few towns. The complexion of the ordinary Fullanee is a\r\ndeep olive, with pleasing features, not much Negro, and long hair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNegroes in Nigritia are known by the _Shoushoua_ (‮شوشوا‬), or\r\nscarifying. Generally in Negro countries, which profess the Mohammedan\r\nreligion, the _Shoushoua_ is abandoned as _haram_ or prohibited. It is\r\nmostly the sign of paganism. The operation is performed by a sharp cutting\r\ninstrument, and is never _effaced_ from the face during life. The annexed\r\ndrawing presents the _Shoushoua_ of the Negroes of Tombo, near Jinnee,\r\nwho are pagans. Whenever the slaves see these marks they know the country\r\nof the other slaves who bear them. Formerly it could be ascertained whether\r\na slave was born on the coast, or brought from the interior, by the\r\npresence or absence of the _Shoushoua_. Now it cannot, because the\r\npractice is discontinued in countries subject to Moslem rule, whence\r\nslaves are sometimes brought. In Ghadames a freed slave is called\r\n_mâtouk_ (‮معتوق‬) or _horr_ (‮حرّ‬). The terms _waseef_\r\n(‮وسيف‬) and sometimes _mamlouk_ (‮مملوك‬) are employed\r\nfor a single slave, and _âbeed_ (‮عبيد‬) for many. The Arabic\r\nterms ‮قايد الوصفان‬ \"the chief of slaves,\" are used to\r\ndenote the person who is responsible for the conduct of slaves, or the\r\n\"Sheikh of the slaves.\" The word RAZZIA, which the French are said\r\nto have invented, and which has acquired such a _triste_ celebrity\r\nby their butcheries of the Arabs in Algeria, is derived from the\r\nsame word as designates a Slave-hunt (_ghazah_)[53] amongst our\r\nSaharan people. The verb is ‮غَزَا‬ _ghaza_, \"petivit,\" which in\r\nthe second conjugation means, \"expeditione bellica petivit hostem,\" and\r\nthe noun in use is ‮غَزَاة‬ _ghazah_, \"expeditione bellica.\" The\r\nBornouese word to denote a slave-hunt, as carried on by the\r\nTouaricks, is DIN, applied to private kidnapping expeditions, and\r\nmeans, I think, simply \"theft,\" showing that not by war, as\r\ncaptives, but by \"theft,\" \"stealing,\" the \"man-stealing\" of the\r\nApostle Paul, are slaves generally procured in Central Africa. It is\r\nonly just that _razzia_ and _ghazah_, the same words, should be so\r\nclosely allied in application to their different actions. The\r\nFrench, to do the thing properly, and in their usual style, should\r\nerect a monument upon the \"Place\" of the city of Algiers, to the new\r\ninvention RAZZIA, with its derivations from _ghazah_, \"a\r\nslave-hunt.\" A prize essay might also be proposed to the Oriental\r\nChair of Paris, and its various students, now looking for\r\ndistinction as interpreters in the land of RAZZIAS or \"butcheries,\"\r\nfor the best derivation and historical progress of the term RAZZIA,\r\nas used by Christian and civilized nations, in relation to infidel\r\nand Mohammedan barbarians. At the bottom of the monument erected by\r\nthe French to the DEMON RAZZIA, may be appended the following\r\nveracious words, copied from the late proclamation of the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, on his assumption of the high post of Governor-General of\r\nAlgeria (_Moniteur Algérien_, October 20, 1847):--\"You have learned\r\nby experience, O Mussulmans! how just and clement is the Government\r\nof France.\" The Duke unpardonably forgets to cite one of the last\r\nproofs of this just and clement Government, the roasting of a tribe\r\nof Arabs, men, women and children in the caverns of the Atlas! . . . . Will\r\nnot the Lying Bulletin (native of France) be proclaimed till\r\ndoomsday?\r\n\r\nThis morning the merchants asked me why the English did not drive\r\nout the French from Algeria. They had often badgered me with this\r\nsubject. I thought it better to speak plainly at once, and for all.\r\nI began by asking, why should the English drive out the French? and\r\ncontinued, \"France and England are now at peace. They don't wish to\r\nmake war at all, and England does not consider Algeria of such\r\nimportance as to go to war about it. England did not derive much\r\nbenefit from Algeria when Mussulmans ruled there; besides the\r\nAlgerines were always sea-robbers. The English were obliged to go\r\nand chastise them several times before the French captured their\r\ncountry. And do not think, that if war did take place between\r\nEngland and France, and the English should drive the French out of\r\nAlgeria, the country would therefore be given up to the Sultan and\r\nthe Mussulmans. The English might wish to rule there themselves.\r\nUpon no account wish for war in Algeria, for the miseries of the war\r\nwould chiefly fall upon you, Mussulmans.\" This completely settled\r\nthem, and exasperated them, as well it might; they said no more. The\r\nMussulmans always have in their memories the conduct of the English\r\nwhen they drove out the French from Egypt, and discussing this kind\r\nof politics, it is quite natural.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I heard a Souafee holding forth to another group. His\r\ntheme was, the Shânbah, Warklah, Touaricks, Tugurt, Souf, and\r\nGhadames, and it was evident to him that besides the people now\r\nenumerated there were no others in the world. A respectable Moor\r\nobserved at the time, \"That Souafee is a rascal. He's as great a\r\nrobber as a Shânbah bandit. Mussulmans are not like Christians. The\r\nChristians have but one word, and are brothers. The Mussulmans have\r\na thousand and ten thousand words, they don't speak the truth, and\r\nthey are enemies to one another.\" The ingenuous Moor knew little of\r\nthe history of Europe and America. I did not disabuse him of his\r\ngood opinion of us. He was a Ben Wezeet, and complained that now the\r\n_Nāther_ (‮ناظر‬), or native overseer of the city, and the Kady or\r\njudge, and some of the richest merchants belonged to the Ben Weleed,\r\nand added mournfully, with a sigh, \"It was not so in my father's\r\ntime. But the world has changed, and this is the new world.\"\r\n\r\nIn reading the Arabic Testament, I have noticed several parallel customs\r\nor habits between The East and North Africa. Take this:\r\n\r\n\"But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote upon the ground.\"\r\n(John viii. 6.)\r\n\r\nPeople of Ghadames are writing daily with their fingers on the ground.\r\nThey are also wont, with fancy ornamental sticks, which they usually\r\ncarry, to illustrate their ideas on the sand or dust of the streets, by\r\ndrawing figures. In speaking with them on geography, they sketch shapes\r\nof countries. They cast up all their ordinary accounts by writing figures\r\non the sand. They have also certain games which they play by the use of\r\nsand. Sand is their paper, their ledger, their boards of account, their\r\npavement, and their auxiliary in a thousand things. It is said in the\r\nGospels, that The Saviour escaped to the mountains[54], either from the\r\npressure of the people, or from the persecutions of his enemies. Persons\r\nare accustomed to escape to the mountains in Barbary, more particularly\r\nin Morocco and Algeria; but also in this country. Our Saviour, besides,\r\ngives the same advice to his disciples: \"Let them which are in Judea\r\n_flee to the mountains_.\" (Luke xxi. 21.) It has always been difficult to\r\napprehend fugitives in the mountains, especially in ancient times, when a\r\ngood police did not exist. The conqueror has always had great difficulty,\r\nand exposed his conquests to imminent risk, by pursuing the conquered in\r\nmountainous districts. Such are the instincts and habits of men in all\r\nages. The Desert has, besides, afforded an asylum to the fugitive and\r\nunfortunate, as well as the persecuted. Our Saviour was wont to retire to\r\ndesert places. In this country, the discomfited defenders of their\r\ncountry's liberties have invariably escaped to The Sahara. How many times\r\nhas Abd-el-Kader escaped to the mountains of Rif, or the solitudes of The\r\nSahara? But it is unnecessary to pursue this obvious idea farther,\r\notherwise it also will escape to The Mountains or The Desert.\r\n\r\nThe \"five _barley_ loaves,\" (John vi. 9,) reminds me of the _barley_\r\nbread of these countries, more frequent than any other sort of bread.\r\nWheaten bread is rarely eaten by the lower classes.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to cite all the passages of Scripture where the people in\r\nthe towns and villages are represented as bringing out their sick of\r\nevery kind and description. (Matt. xiv. 14, 35, 36.) So it is in North\r\nAfrica. Whenever an European visits these countries with any pretensions\r\nto medical skill, all the sick of the place are brought out to him. When\r\nI see the sick daily brought to me--as also when I was in The\r\nMountains--I cannot help thinking of those affecting pictures of disease\r\nand misery which were providentially exhibited to demonstrate the divine\r\nskill of the Great Physician of mind and body.\r\n\r\nSalt is procured in a few hours' journey beyond _Sidi Mâbed_, and is\r\nconsidered superior to that procured at the _Salinæ_ of the coast. This\r\nSaharan salt is only obtained after there has been some rain, the earth\r\nbeing impregnated with it, and the water washing away the earthy\r\nparticles. It is gathered in the dry season.\r\n\r\n_19th._--Amuse myself with Arabic reading and philological studies. The\r\nmornings continue cool. Administer now little medicine, for I have but\r\nlittle left. Ordered an Arab to be bled by the old Moor, who possesses a\r\ngood lancet. The big hulking Arab proved a greater coward than a child.\r\nHow sickness unnerves a man, the hardiest and strongest of men! I once\r\ntook a passage from Algeria to Marseilles in a French transport of\r\nconvalescents. There I saw the brave and brilliant French troops cry and\r\nwhine like children under the influence of fever. When the old Moor had\r\nbled the soldier, he said to me, \"Where's the money?\" This shows that,\r\nthough they rarely think of remunerating the services of the Christian\r\nTabeeb, they have a perfectly clear conception of what is due to the\r\nlabour and skill of a doctor when the case refers to themselves. Some\r\ntime after, I went to the old Moor again, and asked him to bleed another\r\nsoldier attacked with fever. He refused to bleed him, alleging that he\r\nmust be paid. \"He will die,\" I said. \"Let him die,\" returned the\r\nunfeeling old blood-letter; \"why do they bring soldiers here, we don't\r\nwant them?\" This afternoon I visited the barrack, where several Arab\r\nsoldiers were laid up with the fever, which they had caught at Emjessem.\r\nOne was very bad. The Arabs said to me, \"You must give him money to buy\r\nsome bread, and a little meat to make some broth.\" I told them they must\r\ngo the Rais; it was his business to look after his troops. It is\r\ndistressing to witness the condition of these wretched Arabs. At\r\ndifferent times I have given them a little meat, and bread, and oil; but\r\nnow my stock of provisions is getting down, and the communication between\r\nTripoli and Ghadames is very precarious. In the evening I saw the\r\n_Nāther_, and said to him--expecting he would mention it to the Rais,\r\n\"See that soldier lying on the stone-bench; he is sick, and has nothing\r\nto eat.\"\r\n\r\n_The Nāther._--\"Yes, he is ill.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"But he has nothing to eat; can't you get him something to eat?\"\r\n\r\n_The Nāther,_--\"Pooh, he must die.\"\r\n\r\nThe other Moors present laughed at my simplicity in begging something to\r\neat for a fever-worn, emaciated wretch of a soldier. The matter of fact\r\nis, these poor fellows are detested by the inhabitants, and starved to\r\ndeath by the Government. The soldier had caught the fever of Derge,\r\nwhilst sent there on business, which is a bad tertian fever, prevalent in\r\nsome oases of The Sahara.\r\n\r\nLately, as my turjeman and Said, with several negroes, were\r\nchatting, and saying people would have husbands and wives in the\r\nnext world, I asked, in the manner of the Sadducees, \"If a woman had\r\nthree husbands in this world, whose wife would she be in the next?\"\r\nThey all answered, \"_The wife of the last_.\" As some of the group of\r\nthese theologians and diviners of the future state were negroes, I\r\nasked, \"What _colour_ will people be in the next world?\" They\r\nreplied, \"_All white_, and alike; and not only will their skins be\r\nwhite, but all their clothing will be _white_.\" White, indeed, is\r\nthe favourite colour of Mussulmans; and a sooty-black Mohammedan\r\nnegro will set off his face with a white turban, as our Christian\r\nniggers do their _japan_ with a lily-white neckcloth. But _white_ is\r\nthe colour of purity, of religion in North Africa and The\r\nEast, as in _Biblical_ times.--περιβεβλημένους ἐν\r\nἱματίοις λευχοῖς. (Rev. iv. 4.)\r\n\r\n_20th._--Weather continues fine and cool. Less meat to be had; nothing\r\ndecided about the new levy of money, except that the people will not or\r\ncannot pay. The Sheikh Makouran tells me he is greatly in debt to Messrs.\r\nSilva and Laby, and so are all Ghadamsee merchants. The money now\r\nemployed in commerce is chiefly that of European and other merchants of\r\nTripoli and Tunis. \"We have no money,\" says Makouran, \"we cannot pay any\r\nnew levies. If Rais persists, he must collect our money at the edge of\r\nthe sword; and this can't last, for we shall all soon die of hunger.\"\r\nThese continual complaints make me melancholy, and added to my impatience\r\n\"to be up and doing,\" make me very peevish. O Dio! but such is the lot of\r\nman, to suffer always, either in mind or body. Much annoyed at my taleb\r\nfor eating Said's dinner, even before my face. These Moors, at least some\r\nof them, have neither honour nor conscience. I suppose the taleb is\r\npinching his belly to pay his portion of the new contribution. To punish\r\nthe taleb, I give Said coffee before him, without asking him to take any.\r\nI may observe, the Moors don't like to see me treat the poor blacks and\r\nslaves as their equals. I frequently give the negroes tea and coffee\r\nbefore I serve them, to show I despise such distinctions, although,\r\nperhaps, against propriety.\r\n\r\nThe taleb began boasting about Soudan, and he has much reason to\r\nboast of it, if we compare what Mohammedans have there done with\r\nwhat Christians have done on the Western Coast of Africa. He said,\r\n\"There's no _gomerick_ (Custom-house), no oppression, for the people\r\nare Mussulmans.\" Such were the reasons for their not being\r\noppressive. It is a great question how far a country may be\r\ncivilized, and in how short a time, without actual conquest?\r\nCivilization has progressed in Central Africa with the spread of\r\nIslamism. When it reaches the point of Mahometan civilization it\r\nwill stop. The question with us is, \"Whether we shall civilize the\r\nMohammedans, and so work on Central Africa, or reconquer their\r\nconquests?\" There appears very little chance of civilizing Africa\r\nwithout arms and conquest. Bornou, Soudan, and its numerous\r\ncities, Timbuctoo and Jinnee, formerly all governed by the\r\n_Kohlan_--‮كحلان‬, or \"blacks,\" are now governed by strangers,\r\neither Arabs (pure) or Touaricks or Fullans. These are the present\r\nmost important kingdoms of the ancient Nigritia, and include a\r\npopulation of some millions. I continue to pursue my inquiries\r\nrespecting the Fullans. All agree in representing them as originally\r\n_Arab_, but now greatly mixed, of very dark colour, some being\r\nnearly black, others, and most of them, a dark brown and yellow red,\r\nand some nearly white. The fortunes of the Fullans, emerging\r\nfilthily from the dregs and offscouring of The Sahara, have become\r\nas great as the old Romans formerly in Europe, but they will always\r\nhave powerful and vindictive rivals in the Touarghee and pure Arab\r\nand Berber races. The Revd. Mr. Schön has given a too unfavourable\r\nreport of the Fullans, in his Notes and Journal of the Niger\r\nExpedition, biassed against them in his Missionary zeal, simply\r\nbecause they are Mahometans. It is true that the Fullans are great\r\nslave-dealers, but so are nearly all the princes of Africa. The mild\r\nand equitable administration of the kingdoms of Kanou, Succatou,\r\nKashna, and other immense centres of population, as carried on by\r\nthe Fullans, is notorious throughout The Great Desert. No people of\r\nNigritian Africa has so profoundly excited my best sympathies as the\r\nFullanee races[55].\r\n\r\nThe Moors do not fondle and dandle their children on their knees, as\r\nparents are accustomed in Europe; and when grown up, the children appear\r\nas distant from their parents as strangers. This arises from the absolute\r\nauthority assumed by parents over children during their minority. I have\r\noften been angry to see some of the lower people here teaching the\r\nchildren to call me _Kafer_ (\"infidel\") as a sort of religious duty,\r\nlest, I imagine, the children should see at last that there is no very\r\ngreat difference between a _Kafer_ and a Moslemite.\r\n\r\nWas much amused this afternoon in seeing physic administered to camels.\r\nThe camel is made to lie down, and its knee joints are tied round so that\r\nit cannot get up. One person then seizes hold of the skin and cartilage\r\nof the nose, and that of the under jaw, and wrests with all his force the\r\nmouth wide open, whilst another seizes hold of the tongue and pulls it\r\nover one side of the mouth; this done, another pours the medicine down\r\nthe throat of the animal, and, when the mouth is too full, they shut the\r\njaws and rub and work the medicine down its throat. The disease was the\r\nfalling off of the hair; and the medicine consisted of the stones of\r\ndates split into pieces and mixed with dried herbs, simple hay or grass\r\nherbs, powdered as small as snuff, the mixture being made with water.\r\nPeople told me it would fatten the camel as well as restore its hair.\r\nCamels frequently have the mange, and then they are tarred over. For\r\nunknown incomprehensible diseases, the Moors burn the camel on the head\r\nwith hot irons, and call this physic. Men are treated in the same way,\r\nand the Moors are very fond of these analogies between men and brutes.\r\nWhat is good for a camel is good for a man, and what is good for man is\r\ngood for a camel. Whilst the camel was being drugged, a Touarick came up\r\nand said, \"_Salām âleikom_\" to me. They always use this primitive mode of\r\nsalutation. When they swear oaths they also say, \"_Allah Akbar_,\" (God is\r\nGreatest!) the famous war-cry of the Saracennic conquerors of olden\r\ntimes. They are primitive in all their ideas and words; their manners are\r\nequally stiff, and slow or courtly, \"stately and dignified;\" they fully\r\nunderstand the doctrine that, \"Great bodies move slow.\"\r\n\r\nA man is said sometimes not to be worth \"a pinch of snuff;\" and yet\r\na pinch of snuff will knock a man down, as it knocked me down this\r\nevening. My value then does not quite reach to a pinch of snuff\r\nstandard. To come to explanation: a merchant offered me a pinch of\r\nsnuff, and to please him, I took a large pinch, pushing a portion of\r\nit up my nostrils. Immediately I fell dizzy and sick, and in a short\r\ntime, vomited violently. The people stared at me with astonishment,\r\nand were terrified out of their wits, and thought I was about to\r\ngive up the ghost. They never saw snuff before produce such terrible\r\neffects. After some time, I got a little better and returned home.\r\nThis snuff was that from Souf, and what people call _wâr_\r\n(\"difficult\"). I had been warned of it, and therefore richly paid\r\nfor my folly. Moreover, it was a violation of my usual abstinence\r\nfrom this not very elegant habit. The Souf snuff is extremely\r\npowerful; it is constantly imported here, and for the satisfaction\r\nof snuff-takers and snuff-taking tourists, I am bound to inform them\r\nthat they will find snuff much cheaper in Ghadames than in Tripoli.\r\nPeople call snuff hot and cold, according to its stimulating,\r\nirritating, and tickling power. It is prohibited to drink wine and\r\nspirits amongst Moslemites, but, nevertheless, many of them do not\r\nfail to intoxicate themselves with everything besides which comes in\r\ntheir way: they snuff most horribly all the live-long day. In the\r\nseason the Arabs drink their _leghma_, and the Mahometan Negroes\r\ntheir _bouza_, the Soudanic merchants chew their _ghour_, nuts, and\r\n_kouda_, as our jolly tars their tobacco, and others munch the\r\n_trona_. My taleb came to me to see if I were dead. He had heard\r\nsuch a horrible report in the town. I embraced the opportunity of\r\nlecturing him upon the absurdity of the prohibition from drinking\r\nwine, when he and others intoxicated themselves with snuff. But man\r\nwill have _his_ stimulant, and the tee-totaller, who protests\r\nagainst all stimulants, seeks his in his tea and coffee. There is no\r\nharm in this, and the question only remains to seek as harmless a\r\nstimulant, as consistent with health as possible. In justice to the\r\nMarabout city of Ghadames, I must mention that some of the more\r\nstrict Mohammedans consider snuffing, as well as smoking, prohibited by\r\ntheir religion, and opium (‮ععيون‬), and _keef_, an intoxicating\r\nherb, sometimes called _takrounee_, ‮تكروني‬, are not smoked\r\nin this place. In general, few of the Moors of this place smoke at all.\r\n\r\n_21st._--Weather fine, no rain. The merchants begin to bake biscuits for\r\ntheir journey to Ghat, which looks like preparation. My friend Abu Beker\r\ncalled and gave me two letters written to him from Timbuctoo by his\r\nbrother, who is established there. Since my return, I have given one of\r\nthese letters to the Royal Asiatic Society, and the other to the British\r\nMuseum, considering them a great curiosity, so long as this city shall\r\nremain separated from us Europeans by such impassable barriers.\r\n\r\nThe following is the translation of the letter presented to the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society:--\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM A BROTHER IN TIMBUCTOO TO A BROTHER IN GHADAMES.\r\n\r\n\"From the poor servant of his Lord, Muhammad ben Ali ben Talib, to our\r\nrespected brethren, Abu Bekr and Muhammad, and Abdallah, and Fatimah, and\r\nAyshah, and our Aunt Aminah; God prosper their conditions, Amen!\r\n\r\n\"After a thousand salutations and respects to you, and the mercy of\r\nGod, and his blessings on you, should you indeed inquire concerning\r\nus, we are well, and you, please God, are so likewise; and we desire\r\nno further favour from God than the sight of your precious\r\ncountenance; may God unite us with you before long, for He is the\r\nHearer (of petitions)! As to this country there is in it neither\r\nbuying nor selling. By G--d, O my brother! this day we are six\r\nmonths in Timbuctoo, and truly in the whole time I have received but\r\n15 mithcals. There is not a single farthing (or kirat) in this town,\r\nnor commerce at all, except in salt, &c., (_some other commodities,\r\nwhose names I cannot discover_.) And our minds are in continual fear\r\nhere from the scarcity of the times. I am desirous of going to\r\nArawan, if we can find something to sell there, when the people of\r\nKiblah (_the South_) come; but they are not yet arrived, up to the\r\npresent moment, and we do not think they will come. And thou, O my\r\nbrother, beware of sending us any thing! as in this country there is\r\nno commerce, (neither buying nor selling); and whatever has been\r\nsent us, we have received for it neither far nor near. And truly,\r\nfrom the day in which we entered Timbuctoo, we have given 600 louats\r\n(some measure) to the Touaricks and the Fullans. But do you pray\r\nwith us that we may be delivered from this land; and we have no more\r\nnews after the letter which we have written to you. Convey our\r\nsalutation to our aunt and to our brothers, many thousand\r\nsalutations; and to Muhammad ben al Tayil, and his brother and his\r\nsons, many thousand salutations; and to Muhammad Ibn Ibrahim\r\nTaraki, many thousand salutations. Salute also the Hajj al Beshir,\r\nand his brother the Hajj Yusuff, if he is arrived; and salute also\r\nHajj Abdallah. The people (caravan) of Touat have not yet come to\r\nus. Our salutation to Al Mustafa and his brother Abdal Cadir, and\r\ntell the Hajj al Behir, for God's sake not to send us any thing. Of\r\na truth, we sincerely hope to fulfil your commissions, but in this\r\nland there is neither buying nor selling. By G--d, neither in Arawan\r\nnor in Timbuctoo, have we seen any one who will buy of you for a\r\nmithcal, nor for a kirat. Tell the Hajj al Beshir, the Sheikh has\r\nnot yet arrived. And of all the (----?) I brought to Timbuctoo, I\r\nhave not sold a single thing, and I sent them back to Arawan. Know,\r\nthat there is no dealing here except by cowries, and the cowrie is\r\n3,500 to a mithcal. Convey my salutation to the Hajj Abdal Kerim Ben\r\nAun Allah, and his brother Abdarrahman, and to their sons; many\r\nthousand salutations, and say to them, For God's sake take care how\r\nyou send us any thing, for this land is a vexation to us. May God\r\nnot visit you with vexation, and may he open to us a way of\r\ndeliverance! And our salutation to the Hajj Muhammad Sahh, if he is\r\narrived, and tell him not to forget us in the Fátihah (1st. chap. of\r\nthe Koran, used in prayer,) and in the prayer called Salihah (the\r\nBeneficial.) And also to his son and to his mother, many thousand\r\nsalutations. And our salutation to the Hajj Muhammad ben Ali, and\r\nhis brother, and their father, many thousand salutations. And\r\nsalutation to our cousin (the daughter of our uncle) Miriam, many\r\nthousand salutations, and to our aunt Sultánah, and to her brothers,\r\nand to (some other female name) and her sons, many thousand\r\nsalutations. And our salutation to our cousins (the children of our\r\nuncle) and say to them, For God's sake do not forget us in the\r\nFátihah and the prayer Salihah, that God may deliver us from this\r\nland; and the people (\"or caravan\") of Touat are not yet come to us.\r\nO my brethren! we anxiously and most earnestly do desire news of\r\nyou; the Lord give us news of your welfare before long. And do thou,\r\nO my brother! send us some cinnamon and some black pepper, and some\r\ngrains of ‮جلاو‬. And when thou writest, give us all the news, and\r\ntake care not to leave your letter unclosed, for the people here\r\nread it, and be sure to seal it. Salute the inhabitants of our\r\nstreet, all of them, without exception, each one by name.\r\n\r\n\"And so farewell: at the date of Rajab the 25th, in the year 1246; and\r\nagain farewell, from this poor (servant of God,) and many thousand\r\nsalutations, as also from Ibrahim and from the Hajj al Mansur and the\r\nHajj al Mansur's son, who is still with him. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\"(Postscript below.)--Convey our salutation to Hajj Hamad, and tell him\r\nMuhammad ben Canab is doing well, and he is in Arawan; and in like manner\r\nsalute from us his brother Ali.\r\n\r\n\"(2nd Postscript at the side.)--Salutation also to our uncle, and\r\nsay to him, that among the people of the Sheikh (‮اهل الشيخ‬)\r\nwe obtain nothing, except what the Lord has brought us (a proverbial\r\nexpression of the Moors, signifying nothing at all.) So farewell!\r\n\r\nADDRESS.\r\n\r\n\"To the hand of our esteemed brethren Abu Bekr, and Muhammad and\r\nAbdullah ben Ali Ibn Talib; may God amend their condition, amen!\r\n\r\n\"(With Solomon's seal, and a rude commencement of another; the name\r\nof Ben Talib, and the mystical words ‮طه‬ and ‮بسم‬ the first\r\nof which is prefixed to the xxth chapter of the Koran, and the other\r\nprobably intended for ‮طسم‬, heading the xxvith, and xxviiith; or\r\nfor ‮يس‬ xxxvi.)\"\r\n\r\nObs.--This letter is written within and without, and on every fold of it.\r\nThe advice to seal the letter to prevent it from being \"Grahamized\" is\r\ncurious. I have seen a hundred letters in The Desert _un_sealed, and it\r\nis only in case of suspicion, that the Saharan merchants seal their\r\nletters. Such is their confidence in each other's honour and good faith,\r\nthat it is an insult to seal a letter when put into the hands of a\r\nfriend. It would appear, from this letter, that some twenty years ago the\r\ncommerce of Timbuctoo was in the most languishing deplorable state; but\r\nas far as I can judge, from the present operations of the merchants in\r\nGhadames, the trade of Timbuctoo has in a measure revived. The letter\r\nitself is a most admirable specimen of the epistolary style of the\r\nSaharan Moors, and in this respect alone is of considerable value.\r\n\r\nWhen walking out this morning, an impudent young dog came running after\r\nme and shouted, \"There is no God but God, and Mahomet is the Prophet of\r\nGod;\" whilst another cried out, \"You Kafer!\" Judging it necessary to put\r\na stop to this, I gave each little imp for his pains a hard rap of the\r\nhead with my fly-flapper, which greatly surprised them, and sent them off\r\nyelping. Some of the boys, however, are very friendly, and come running\r\nafter me and take hold of my hand. A day or two afterwards these young\r\nrascals came running after me again in the same way; but they were chased\r\nby an adult Moor, who gave them a good thrashing.\r\n\r\n_22nd._--Weather fine. Nothing new. Bought Said a new pair of Morocco\r\nshoes, and made him happy for a day or two. He begins to sulk about going\r\namongst the Touaricks. To my great joy, the _Shantah_ from Tripoli has\r\narrived, bringing letters from Colonel Warrington, and Mr. Francovich,\r\nwhich latter has remitted to me 125 mahboubs. Two Touaricks have also\r\narrived from Touat. The road is open. Rain has fallen in many places of\r\nThe Desert in copious showers, which has buoyed up the hopes of the\r\ncamel-graziers. Rumours of fighting between the Shânbah and Touaricks are\r\nprevalent.\r\n\r\nThe Tibboo left during the night for Ghat--ALONE! riding on a single\r\ncamel. His conduct has astonished everybody. Some say \"he's mad,\" and\r\nsome say \"he's a bandit.\" He had with him a small quantity of light\r\ngoods, and about 300 dollars in cash. I asked the Rais about him. He\r\nobserved, \"That Tibboo has no wit. Many people die on the routes, the\r\ncamels running away whilst they sleep. What can he do alone!\" I asked the\r\npeople, all of whom replied, \"The Tibboo is a wonderful fellow!\" One\r\nsaid, \"Ah, that's a man, Yâkob. No Christian like the Tibboo.\" But\r\nanother said, \"Without doubt he's a cut-throat, that is the reason he\r\ngoes alone. Even the Touaricks are afraid of him; and when they brought\r\nhim here he quarrelled with them several times. Besides, a few days ago\r\nhe was going to knock down the toll-taker at the gate.\" After this\r\ndisplay of personal daring, I shall never have a contemptible idea of a\r\nNegro. The free, independent, and enlightened gentleman slave-driver of\r\nYankee Land, armed with that symbol of order and good government, the\r\nbowie-knife! would find his match in this his brother Tibboo\r\nslave-driver. The Tibboo has done what no man of this city would have\r\ndared to do, in undertaking a journey of some twenty days over The Desert\r\nalone. What is very extraordinary, he never travelled the route but once\r\nbefore, that is, when he came here. They say he will arrive at Ghat in\r\ntwelve days. He took the precaution of purchasing a good pair of\r\nhorse-pistols before he left. I may add, he arrived safe and sound at\r\nGhat.\r\n\r\n_23rd._--This morning exceedingly cold. In going out, a man said to\r\nme, \"Where are you going this cold morning?\" People were all\r\nshivering, or wrapped up in their burnouses. Said is attacked with\r\nophthalmia. Received a visit from an old Arab doctor. He says cattle\r\nare attacked with the plague, as well as men. He wrote me a receipt\r\nfor the cure of _night_-blindness, which would cure it in one night.\r\nHe says, in the neighbouring desert, towards the west, there is a\r\nsmall oasis of Arabs, who are called _El-Hawamad_--‮الحومد‬--who\r\nare always afflicted by night-blindness, which singular affection is\r\ncalled by them _Juhur_ (‮جُهُر‬). Mr. Jackson, in his Morocco,\r\ncalls this strange disease _butelleese_. The Arabs of _El-Hawamad_ see\r\nperfectly well in the day-time. But I must mention, that I received\r\nan application for medicine from a person who is affected with the\r\nsame strange kind of malady. The European physicians call this\r\ndisease _Nyctalopia_ (Νυκταλωπια). I recently myself met with a\r\ncase in London. But what is equally extraordinary, Captain Lyon (I\r\nthink) mentions a case which he met with in The Desert, of a person\r\nwho could see in the night-time but not in the day-time--a human\r\nowl. We conversed about other diseases in Ghadames. The principal,\r\nas before-mentioned, are ophthalmia and diarrhœa. There are two\r\nlepers; a few dropsical people; and, occasionally, small-pox and\r\nsyphilitic diseases. There are, besides, various cutaneous\r\naffections. Dogs are known to go mad amongst the Arabs, but not very\r\noften. When mad, they are called _makloub_. The remedy is, when they\r\nbite people, the hair of the mad dog himself, rubbing it over the\r\npart bitten. Mussulmans are fond of this antagonistic idea, of the\r\nbane and the antidote being one and the same thing, for they\r\npreserve the dead scorpions to be applied to the sting of the living\r\nones, and they aver it to be a certain cure. Quackery is the native\r\ngrowth of the ingenious as well as the whimsical and hypochondriacal\r\nideas of men. In dropsy the native doctors cut the body to let out\r\nthe water, as we do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWrote letters to Mr. Alsager, Colonel Warrington, and others. People\r\ngrumbling about their letters being too high charged. Formerly letters\r\nwent free to Tripoli. The Turkish post-office and policy never fail to\r\nmake things worse. Treating some Moors with coffee and loaf-sugar, one\r\nasked me if there were blood in sugar, for so he had heard from some\r\nEuropeans in Tripoli. I told him in loaf sugar. \"What, the blood of\r\npigs?\" one cried. \"How do I know?\" I rejoined; \"if the refiner has no\r\nbullock's blood, why not use that of pigs?\" This frightened them all out\r\nof their senses. They will not eat loaf-sugar again in a hurry. A most\r\nludicrous anecdote of the old Bashaw of Tripoli here occurs to me. Old\r\nYousef one day sent for Colonel Warrington, with a message that the\r\nConsul's presence was very particularly required. The Consul, putting on\r\nhis best Consular uniform, and taking with him his Vice-Consul, his\r\nChancellor, and his Dragoman, immediately waited upon His Highness. The\r\nConsul found His Highness sitting in full Divan, surrounded with all his\r\nhigh functionaries. Approaching the Bashaw, the Consul was begged to take\r\na seat. His Highness then opened business, and, drawing a very long and\r\nsolemn face, requested to know, \"If the Christians were carrying away all\r\nthe bones from the country?\" assuring the Consul that such he heard was\r\nthe case from his people, adding, that even the graveyards were ransacked\r\nfor bones. The Consul, nothing blinking, or disquieted, congratulated His\r\nHighness upon bringing such an important subject before his notice, and\r\nobserved, \"It is very improper for the Christians to be ransacking the\r\ntombs for old bones to ship off for Europe.\" \"Improper!\" exclaimed the\r\nBashaw, \"why the man who does so ought to be beheaded!\" \"Yes, yes,\"\r\nreplied the Consul, coaxingly, \"he ought, your Highness; I quite agree\r\nwith you.\" The Bashaw then got a little more calm, and begged of the\r\nConsul, as a favour, to tell him what the Christians did with all these\r\nold bones. The Consul, now assuming a magnificent air, deigned to reply,\r\n\"Now, your Highness, you must be cool. You drink coffee?\" \"Yes.\" \"You put\r\nsugar in it?\" \"Yes\" (impatiently). \"You use white sugar?\" \"Yes, yes,\"\r\nsaid the Bashaw, half amazed, half trembling, wondering what would come\r\nnext. \"Then,\" cried the Consul triumphantly, \"I beg most submissively to\r\ninform your Highness, hoping that your Highness will not be angry, but\r\nthank me for the information, that the old bones are used to make white\r\nsugar with.\" Hereupon was an awful explosion of _Allahs!_--beginning with\r\nHis Highness the Bashaw, and going round the whole assembled Divan, in\r\nsuch serious and perplexed conclave now met. Then followed _harams!_--in\r\nthe midst of which Colonel Warrington graciously and elegantly backed\r\nhimself out of the Divan, smiling and bowing, bowing and smiling, to the\r\nutter horror of all present. Next day His Highness made a proclamation\r\nforbidding any of his subjects from exporting old bones on pain of death.\r\nOn his part, the Consul issued a notice calling upon all British subjects\r\nnot to be such barbarians as to violate the tombs of pious Mussulmans, at\r\nthe same time threatening them with the full weight of the Consular\r\ndispleasure. I am assured that Yousef Bashaw never ate white sugar\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe liberties which Colonel Warrington was wont to take with old Yousef\r\nBashaw, of the Caramanly dynasty, could not now be, in these days of\r\nOttoman politeness, at all tolerated. For a long series of years, and\r\nespecially during the French war, the Colonel was the virtual Bashaw of\r\nTripoli. I shall only give another of a thousand incidents in which the\r\nBritish Consul showed himself the master, and the Bashaw the slave,\r\ninstead of the Sovereign of his own country. One day the Bashaw had done\r\nsomething to offend the Consul. Colonel Warrington, hearing of it whilst\r\nriding out, immediately rides off to the Castle, and rushes, whip in\r\nhand, into the presence of the Bashaw, producing consternation through\r\nthe whole Court. An Italian, having at the time an audience with His\r\nHighness, demanded, \"_Che cosa vuole Signore Consule?_\" seeing the Consul\r\nfrustrated in his rage for want of an interpreter. \"_Tell him_ (the\r\nBashaw) _he's a rascal!_\" roared the Consul, almost shaking his whip over\r\nthe head of His Highness. But the Italian was just as far off, not\r\nknowing English, and fortunately could not interpret this elegant\r\ncompliment. The very next day, the Consul and the Bashaw dined together\r\nat the British Garden, the Colonel slapping the old gentleman over his\r\nshoulder, and drinking wine with him, like two jolly chums. In this way,\r\nColonel Warrington managed to be, what he was called in Malta, \"_Bashaw\r\nof Tripoli_.\" Now that Colonel Warrington, during the time these pages\r\nhave been going through the press, has left us for another and a better\r\nworld, we may for a moment compare his Consular system with that which\r\nwas pursued by the late Mr. Hay, Consul-General of Morocco. The\r\ndifference is striking, if not remarkable. Colonel Warrington boasted of\r\nbeing able to do anything and everything in Tripoli; Mr. Hay boasted of\r\nbeing able to do nothing in Morocco. The former had the Bashaw under his\r\nthumb, or hooked by the nose; the latter stood at an awful distance from\r\nthe Shereefian Presence. Colonel Warrington underrated the difficulties\r\nand dangers of travelling in Tripoli and Central Africa, making the route\r\nfrom Tripoli to Bornou as safe as the road from London to Paris; Mr. Hay,\r\nexaggerating every obstacle, represented it as unsafe to walk in the\r\nenvirons of Tangier, under its very walls, and even boasted of himself\r\nbeing shot at in the interior of Morocco, on a Government mission, and\r\nwhilst attended by an escort of the Emperor's troops. With Colonel\r\nWarrington, a mission of science or philanthropy had a real chance of\r\nsuccess; with Mr. Hay, no mission could possibly succeed--failure was\r\ncertain. And so I might continue the opposite parallels. But in justice\r\nto these late functionaries and their friends, I must observe, that both\r\nwere zealous servants of Government and their country. They exerted\r\nthemselves diligently and conscientiously to protect and advance the\r\ninterests of their countrymen, who had relations with Tripoli or Morocco,\r\naccording to their peculiar temperaments and circumstances. No doubt they\r\ngave Government at home an immense deal of unnecessary trouble, and\r\nsometimes even annoyance; but so long as each public functionary abroad\r\nthinks the affairs of his own particular post of more importance than\r\nthose of anybody else, this inconvenience will always happen, in a lesser\r\nor greater degree.\r\n\r\nSaid furnishes me with a continual anti-slavery text against the\r\nslave-trade. Everybody asks me if Said is a slave. I reply, \"Slavery is a\r\ngreat sin amongst the English. We cannot have slaves, or make slaves of\r\nour fellow-creatures.\" Then follow discussions, in which I damnify the\r\ntraffick in human beings as much as possible.\r\n\r\nToday witnessed a good specimen of Arab Desert freedom. I was conversing\r\nquietly with the Governor, seated beside him on his ottoman, a privilege\r\ngranted only to me, the Nather (_native_ governor) and the Kady, when\r\nrushed into the apartment a Souafee Arab, exclaiming to the Rais, \"How\r\nare you?\" and seizing hold of his hands, knocked his fly-flap down on the\r\nfloor. His Excellency was shocked at this rudeness, and I myself was a\r\nlittle startled. The conversation which followed, if such it may be\r\ncalled, is characteristic of the bold Arab, and the haughty Turk.\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"The Shânbah are coming to Ghadames.\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"I don't know; God knows.\"\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"My brothers write to me and tell me so.\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"Give me money, and I'll go and look after them.\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"I have no money.\"\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"Make haste, give me money.\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"Have none.\"\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"Where's the money?\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"Go to the Ghadamseeah.\"\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"They tell me you have all their money.\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"Go to them.\"\r\n\r\n_The Souafee._--\"I'm going, _Bislamah_ (good bye.)\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"Bislamah.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Souafee left the threshold of the apartment, his Excellency turned\r\nto me, and raising his right hand underneath his chin, drew its back\r\njerkingly forwards, making the sign of the well-known expression of\r\ncontempt in North Africa. He then said to me:--\"See what a life I lead,\r\nwhat insults I am obliged to put up with! what beasts are these Arabs!\"\r\nThe Souafah are, indeed, the type of the genuine Desert Arab. They have\r\nno foreign master, and manage all their affairs by their own Sheikhs and\r\nKadys. The immense waste of sand lying between Ghadames and Southern\r\nTunis and Algeria, is their absolute domain, in the arid and thirsty\r\nbosom of which are planted, as marvels of nature, their oases of palms.\r\nThe Shânbah bandits, who plunder every body, and brave heaven and earth,\r\nnevertheless dare not lay a finger on them. I cannot better represent the\r\nfeelings of the Souf Arab, nor the \"wild and burning range\" of his\r\ncountry, than by quoting the lines of Eliza Cook:\r\n\r\n  \"Through the desert, through the desert, where the Arab takes his course,\r\n  With none to bear him company, except his gallant horse;\r\n  Where none can question will or right, where landmarks ne'er impede,\r\n  But all is wide and limitless to rider and to steed.\r\n\r\n  No purling streamlet murmurs there, no chequer'd shadows fall;\r\n  'Tis torrid, waste and desolate, but free to each and all.\r\n  Through the desert, through the desert! Oh, the Arab would no change,\r\n  For purple robes or olive-trees, his wild and burning range.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] It is now the fashion in French writers to represent the\r\n    Arabic ‮غ‬ by the Roman R, as _R_'dames for _Gh_adames.\r\n\r\n[54] ‮هرب الي الجبل‬\r\n\r\n[55] _Fullans._--Mungo Park says: \"The Foulahs are chiefly of a\r\n    tawny complexion, with silky hair, and pleasing features.\"--M.\r\n    D'Avezac says: \"In the midst of the Negro races, there stands out\r\n    a _métive_ (_mezzo-termino_?) population, of tawny or copper\r\n    colour, prominent nose, small mouth, and oval face, which ranks\r\n    itself amongst the white races, and asserts itself to be descended\r\n    from Arab fathers, and Tawrode(?) mothers. Their crisped hair, and\r\n    even woolly though long, justifies their classification among the\r\n    _oulotric_ (woolly-haired) populations; but neither the traits of\r\n    their features, nor the colour of their skin, allow them to be\r\n    confounded with Negroes, however great the fusion of the two types\r\n    may be.\" Major Rennell calls them the \"Leucœthiopes of Ptolemy and\r\n    Pliny.\" Mr. D'Eichthal thinks them to be of _Malay_ origin, on\r\n    account of their language; but Dr. Pritchard considers them to be\r\n    a genuine African race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR GOING TO SOUDAN.\r\n\r\n     His Excellency the Rais questions me on my rumoured Journey to\r\n     Soudan.--The Devil has in safe keeping all who are not\r\n     Mahometans.--I am wearing to a Skeleton.--A Caravan of\r\n     Women.--Predestination.--The Shânbah begin their Foray.--The\r\n     Gardens and their Products.--Varieties of the\r\n     Date-Palm.--Locusts.--Brigands spare the Property of the Marabout\r\n     Merchants of Ghadames.--Agricultural Implements in The\r\n     Desert.--Violent capture of a Souf Caravan by the Governor.--Uses\r\n     of the Date-Palm.--The Touarghee Bandit's opinion as to Killing\r\n     Christians.--Combat between an Ant and a Fly.--Loose Phraseology\r\n     in The Mediterranean.--Harsh Hospitality of the Souafah, and\r\n     Usurpation over their Oases by the French.--Money disappearing\r\n     from Ghadames.--The Affair of Messrs. Silva and Levi, and their\r\n     connexion with Ghadamsee Slave-Dealers.--Visit, with his\r\n     Excellency the Governor, the Ruins of _Kesar-el-Ensara_ \"the\r\n     Castle of the Christians.\"--Antiquity of Ghadames, and Account of\r\n     it by Leo Africanus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 23rd, 24th, and 25th, employed in writing letters. On one of these\r\ndays the Rais called me to him and asked, \"Whether I really intended to\r\ngo to Soudan, as the people had reported to him?\" I told him Yes, and\r\nthat I was already making preparations. His Excellency affected great\r\namazement, and looked exceedingly mysterious, but did not know what to\r\nreply. At last he observed, \"I must write to Ahmed Effendi of The\r\nMountains, and if he says you may go, all well, if not, you must not go.\"\r\nI then asked the Rais, what I was to do in Ghadames? His Excellency said\r\nanxiously, \"Stay with me to keep me company. I am surrounded with\r\nbarbarians. I am weary of my life here.\" As the Rais spoke what I knew to\r\nbe the truth, I pitied him and said nothing, although I could not\r\nunderstand this asking of permission from Ahmed Effendi, whom I knew to\r\nbe a queer customer to deal with. However, I interpreted the sense of\r\nColonel Warrington's letter to Rais, viz., \"If I had friends I might\r\nventure further into the interior, if not, stay where I was until I made\r\nfriends.\" I believe the sympathy of the Rais _sincere_, which is a great\r\ndeal for a Turk, or even any body else in this insincere and lying world.\r\nHe is a timid man, and is afraid the Touaricks will make an end of me.\r\nWhat the Rais says is reasonable enough: \"Bring me a Ghadamsee, or a\r\nrespectable Arab merchant whom I know, and who will take you with him,\r\nand be answerable for your head (safety), and will protect you equally\r\nwith himself, then I have no fears for your safety.\" I took my friend\r\nZaleâ to the Rais, who is a native of Seenawan, and much respected by\r\nall. The camels of the giant left to-day for Ghat, his giantship himself\r\nwaits to be conducteur of our caravan.\r\n\r\nIn replying to an observation about another increase of taxes of which\r\nthe people bitterly complained, I said, \"The Mahometan princes are now\r\nthe greatest oppressors of the people, whilst the Christian kings are\r\nmore tolerant, and people enjoyed more security under our Governments.\"\r\nMy taleb replied, \"Yes, it is the truth, Yâkob, and this is the reason.\r\nThe Devil knows that all the Christians, and Jews, and black _kafers_,\r\nbelong to him. So he troubles them not, they are his safe property and\r\nsure possession. But he is always stirring up amongst us Mussulmans evil\r\npassions, and leading our sovereigns to oppress the people, and one\r\nMussulman to oppress another.\" Such is the reasoning of a bigoted\r\nMoslemite, and with him and others it has considerable force. Indeed, a\r\nChristian stands a very poor chance with these subtle orthodox doctors.\r\n\r\n_26th._--The mornings grow colder and colder. I feel the change\r\nsensitively, more so than the natives; am exceedingly chilly. I perceive\r\nthe hot weather has dried up or torn off the flesh from my bones, and my\r\nfeet are very skinny. Attribute this a good deal to the water. Rais is\r\nalmost worn to a skeleton. This morning he called his servants to attest,\r\nhow stout he was when he first came here. But as the heat is gone, I\r\nshall not now drink so much water. The more malicious, in revenge for\r\nTurkish oppression here, hope and pray the Rais will die of the climate,\r\nand every Turk who succeeds him.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Touarick _women_ leave for Ghat. No men go with them, only\r\nsome of their little sons. About ten women form this caravan. They have\r\ncamels to carry their water, and ride on occasionally when they are\r\nfatigued. I asked a Ghadamsee whether these women were not afraid to go\r\nby themselves, particularly now as banditti are reported to be in the\r\nroutes. He replied, \"These Touarick women are a host of witches and\r\nshe-devils. No men will dare to touch them.\" This ghafalah of women is a\r\nperfectly new idea to me. Some of the women are quite young and pretty,\r\nand delicate, and don't appear as if they could bear twenty days'\r\ndesert-travelling. One said to me, \"If you will go with us women, we will\r\ntake better care of you than the men can do.\"\r\n\r\n_27th._--Occupied in writing. Rais paid me a visit in the afternoon. Gave\r\none of the slaves who came with him a pill-box, which highly delighted\r\nthe boy. I found when I visited Rais again, that his Excellency himself\r\nhad become so enamoured with the pill-box, as to purchase it from his\r\nslave. Said continues bad with ophthalmia. The disease seems to attack\r\nmostly people of this country, and not strangers. At any rate it would\r\nseem that we require to be acclimated to catch these diseases, as well as\r\nacclimated to resist them. Rais took it into his head to preach to me\r\nabout the decrees of Heaven. \"You and I,\" said his Excellency, \"were\r\ngreat fools to come to this country; I to leave Constantinople, you to\r\nleave London. But it was the decree of God that we should come to this\r\nhorrible country.\" The decrees of Heaven, or the acknowledgment of such,\r\nare the _bonâ fide_ religion of Ghadames. \"What do the people eat?\" I\r\nsaid to a man. He replied, \"What is decreed!\" Another interposed, \"Don't\r\nbe afraid of the Touaricks; you will not die before the time which is\r\ndecreed by Heaven for you to die.\" Such is consolation in man's misery.\r\nAre we to believe this? or why not believe it?\r\n\r\n_28th_, _29th_, and _30th._--Employed in preparing routes of The Desert.\r\nThis evening the Governor received a letter from his spies in Souf, which\r\nreports that the Shânbah had left their country four days before they\r\nwrote, which is now fifteen days. It is not known whether the banditti\r\nhave taken the route to Ghat or Ghadames. His Excellency has taken\r\nprecautionary measures, and sent soldiers to look out in the routes near\r\nour city. He has also sent to bring back a merchant who started yesterday\r\nto Touat, and another to Derge. The freebooters are 100 horse, and 400\r\ncamels strong. The Giant Touarick taking the alarm, and mounting his\r\nstrongest and fleetest Maharee, has gone off to protect his family and\r\ncountry. He was one of the expedition last year, and slew a dozen Shânbah\r\nwith his own hand. In the meanwhile _caravaning_ to all quarters is to be\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n_31st._--Purchased an outfit for Said. Afterwards he would put them on,\r\nand walked all over the town, and left me to cook the dinner myself. I\r\nsaid nothing to him, humouring his vanity. No people are so fond of new\r\nand fine clothes as Negroes.\r\n\r\n_1st November._--A strong wind blowing from the south-east, or nearly\r\neast. Not very cold, clouds thick and dark, and no sun. The music of the\r\nwind in the date-palms is very agreeable, and tunes my soul to a quiet\r\nsadness. The Ghadamsee merchant who was overtaken on his road to Tourat,\r\nrefuses to come back, and says he trusts in God against the Shânbah. Some\r\nSouf Arabs have come in to-day, giving out that the French wish to assume\r\nthe sovereignty over their country. The able-bodied men of the united\r\noases are calculated at 2,000.\r\n\r\nVisited the gardens with my taleb as _cicerone_. Was much gratified\r\nwith the rural ramble, although there is nothing remarkable to be\r\nseen. The three principal productions are dates, of which there is a\r\ngreat variety, some thirty or forty different sorts[56]; barley and\r\n_ghusub_[57]. The ghusub is grown in the Autumn and the barley in\r\nthe Spring; in this way two crops of corn are reaped in the year. A\r\nlittle wheat is now and then grown, but does not thrive. The native\r\ndate is the _madghou_ (‮مدغو‬) which is also common in Seenawan\r\nand Derge. It is small and filbert-shaped, of a black colour, very\r\npleasant when fresh, but when dry very indifferent. I saw no black\r\ndates in any other parts of The Sahara. The gardens furnish besides\r\na few vegetables and fruits, such as pomegranates, apricots,\r\npeaches, almonds, olives, melons, pumpkins, tomatas, onions, and\r\npeppers, a few grape-trees and fig-trees in the choicest gardens,\r\nbut all in small quantities. There is scarcely a flower or fancy\r\ntree but the _tout_. No person of my acquaintance, except my\r\nturjeman, showed much fancy for botany. He had brought an aloe from\r\nTripoli, and planted it in his garden. It is the only one. He has\r\nanother tree or two besides, which nobody else has. The merchants\r\nhave brought the varieties of the date-palm from the different oases\r\nof The Sahara. Nearly every householder has a garden, and some\r\nseveral. Sometimes a date plantation is divided between two or three\r\nfamilies, each cultivating and gathering the fruits of his pet\r\nchoice palm. Herbage is grown in the gardens for fattening the\r\nsheep. Pounded date-stones both fatten sheep and camels. In summer\r\nthe gardens are intolerable, but in winter deliriously pleasant.\r\nSheikh Makouran is the largest landed-proprietor. He has seventeen\r\ngardens; \"nearly half the country,\" as a person observed. So Europe\r\nis not the only place in the world where there is such an unequal\r\ndivision of the land. The gardens are small, and the whole number is\r\nsome two hundred and odd, only the half of which are regularly\r\nwatered from the Great Spring. As the people can never depend upon\r\nrain, the whole culture is conducted on irrigation. The Ghadamsee\r\ngarden-gate, of all the absurdities of inconvenience is the greatest\r\nI ever met with. It is scarcely large enough for a small sheep to\r\nenter. Every person entering a garden must not only stoop but crawl\r\nthrough the gate. It is fortunate there are no lusty people here,\r\nall being bony and wiry like the Arabs. Not being dependant on rain,\r\nthe gardens only suffer from the locusts, and now and then a\r\nblighting wind. In the Spring of this year these insect marauders\r\npassed over the oasis and made a pillage of the date blossoms for\r\nthirty days, besides doing much damage to the barley. I encountered\r\na flight of the same horde, which emerged from The Desert and then\r\ntook to sea, and were scattered over to Malta and Sicily by the\r\nwind, when I was travelling from Tunis to the isle of Jerbah late in\r\nthe Spring. From Ghadames they proceeded _en masse_ to Tripoli and\r\nGhabs, inflicting great damage. When they passed near the gardens of\r\nGhabs, the people climbed up the fruit-trees and made a great noise,\r\nscreaming and shouting, which kept them from settling in masses on\r\nthe fruit-trees and vegetables. They also kindled a fire and tried\r\nto smoke them away. Many of those which did settle were gathered,\r\ncooked, and eaten with great _gusto_ by the people. I met them\r\nmyself on the immense plains of Solyman; they were the first flight\r\nof locusts I ever saw. I had seen locusts on the hills near Mogador,\r\nwhere they are bred in great numbers. Millions of small green things\r\nwere just starting into being. The locust is a somewhat\r\ndisproportioned insect, the wings are too fine for the bulk and\r\nweight of the body, which explains why they are unable to struggle\r\nagainst the wind; as it is said in the Scriptures, \"and when it was\r\nmorning the east wind brought the locusts.\" (Exod. x. 13.) They do\r\nnot fly high, and when they settle on the ground they roll over very\r\nclumsily. A flight at a distance looks like falling flakes of snow\r\nin a snow-storm. They are mostly of a reddish colour, with\r\nlead-coloured bodies, and some of a glaring yellow. The yellow ones\r\nare said to be the males, and are not so good eating as the others.\r\nThe locust tastes very much like a dry shrimp when roasted. They are\r\nfrom an inch and a half to two and a half long. The head is large\r\nand square, and very formidable. Hence the Scripture allusion: \"and\r\non their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces\r\nwere as the faces of men.\" (Rev. ix. 7.) But the prophecy gives them\r\na superadded power which they do not possess, \"and unto them was\r\ngiven power as the scorpions of the earth have power;\" (v. 3.) for\r\nwhen you catch the locust it makes little resistance and does not\r\nbite. Few of these were eating, and most of them were either flying\r\nor lay motionless basking in the sun, grouped in hundreds round\r\ntufts of long coarse grass. My Moorish fellow-travellers didn't like\r\ntheir appearance. They said the locusts are bad things, and came\r\nfrom the hot country to devour their harvest. It was indeed, an\r\nunpleasant sight, this horde of insect marauders, and soon lost the\r\ncharm of novelty. But the world is made up of the elements of\r\ndestruction and reproduction. Such is the eternal order of\r\nProvidence, and we must bear the evil and the good. I do not think\r\nthat they come far south or from the inner Desert, for they could\r\nnot be bred in regions of desolation, where there is no green thing.\r\nYet these flights were from the south of Ghadames, and at any rate\r\nthey are bred in the Saharan districts, from the banks of the Nile\r\nto the shores of the Atlantic. The world is full of impostors. One\r\nof these went once upon a time to Morocco, and endeavoured to\r\npersuade the people he could destroy all the locusts by some\r\nchemical process. I believe he was a French adventurer.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--Occupied in taking notes of routes. The whole day overcast but no\r\nrain. Rais alternately laughs and admires the Ghadamsee people. He was\r\nendeavouring to prove to me what profound respect the bandits of The\r\nDesert entertain for these Marabout people, and said, \"If a camel of the\r\nGhadamseeah falls down in The Desert and dies, and no person present has\r\na camel to lend them, they leave the goods or the load of the camel on\r\nthe high road until they fetch one. Should a bandit pass by in the\r\nmeanwhile and see the goods, and recognize them to belong to an\r\ninhabitant of Ghadames, he does not even touch them, but passes by and\r\ncalls for the blessing of Heaven upon the Holy City of The Desert.\" This,\r\none would say, is too good to be true, at the same time, I have no doubt\r\nthe banditti of The Desert have a species of religious respect for these\r\npacific-minded, unresisting merchants. I took an opportunity of asking\r\nRais about the use and value of his charms. His Excellency replied, \"They\r\nare to protect me when exposed to robbers like the Shânbah, or to other\r\nevils. These charms will then render me great assistance.\" I I have\r\nalready said Rais is as big a ninny in these superstitious matters as any\r\nof his Maraboutish subjects.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--Am still in great doubt as to the route I shall take for the\r\ninterior. Every route has its separate advantages, and separate dangers.\r\nIn this perplexity what can I do but wait the turn of events? . . . . .\r\nAnother overcast morning, as dull and foggy as Old England's November. A\r\nperfect Thames-London fog. I was accustomed to think that in the bright\r\nsky of an African desert such a mass of cloud and haziness was\r\nimpossible. Still, though gloomy and drear, there is more boldness and\r\ndefiniteness of outline than in England. After a person has been living\r\nlong under the bright skies of the Mediterranean, he may mistake a clear\r\nwinter's day on Blackheath, as I have done, for a moonlight, owing to the\r\nwant of those sharp angles by which nature draws her landscapes in\r\nSouthern Europe. To-day the face of the heavens has cast its shadows upon\r\nthe countenance of the population, for all is dull in business. Every one\r\nis awaiting the result of the skirmishes between the Touaricks and the\r\nShânbah.\r\n\r\n_4th._--A fine morning, and not very cold. No patients, everybody\r\napparently in health. My old friend Berka, the liberated slave, is now\r\noccupied in turning or digging, or hoeing up a whole garden of good size,\r\nabout two days and a half's labour, for which he will receive one\r\nTunisian piastre! (Seven pence English money.) This is free labour. I am\r\nsure the slave labour, the principal here, cannot be cheaper. The\r\nimplements of agriculture are few and simple in The Desert. Friend Berka\r\nhad but a small hoe, which is well described by Caillié, who saw it used\r\nnear Jinnee, and indeed it seems to be used throughout Central Africa.\r\nThis hoe is about a foot long, and eight inches broad; the handle, which\r\nis some sixteen inches in length, slants very much. With this hoe they\r\nturn up the earth instead of the plough, and prepare and open and shut\r\nthe squares of irrigated fields. For reaping they make use of a small\r\nsickle without teeth. The caravans usually have a supply of these sickles\r\nfor cutting up Desert provender for the camels. The use of the hoe\r\nrequires constant stooping to the ground and is consequently laborious,\r\nbut the Saharan fields are very limited, and are soon hoed up. The\r\nsmallness of space is compensated by a redundant fertility, and double\r\nand even treble crops in the course of the year. Passing by a group of\r\ngossipping slaves to-day, one came running up to me and said, \"Buy me,\r\nbuy me, and I will go with you to Ghat. I shall only cost you 100\r\nmahboubs.\" This is humiliating enough, but those who offer their services\r\nfor sale, like hundreds in the metropolis of London, to write up a bad\r\ncause and write down a good one, or to--\r\n\r\n        \"Make the worse appear\r\n      The better reason--\"\r\n\r\n    \"With words cloth'd in reason's garb--\"\r\n\r\ncertainly perform a greater act of degradation than these poor debased\r\nbondsmen.\r\n\r\nA few evenings ago intelligence arrived that a Souf caravan of eight\r\ncamels and five persons were seen about a day and a half from this city,\r\nproceeding in the route of Ghat. This gave rise to suspicions that the\r\nnews about the Shânbah and Touaricks was a hoax of the Souafah, in order\r\nto frighten the people of Ghadames, and allow them (the Souafah) to get\r\nfirst to the market of Ghat, and buy slaves cheaper. So reason the\r\nmerchants with the usual jealousy of such people. Rais, on receipt of\r\nthe above, summoned his Divan, and it was debated, \"Whether the Souafah\r\nshould not be brought in here by force?\" The question was decided in the\r\naffirmative, and late at night, fourteen Arab soldiers, two Arabs of\r\nSeenawan, intimately acquainted with the routes, and an official of the\r\nRais, went off to seize the caravan. This bold measure may bring us\r\nunpleasant consequences. First of all, the Governor has no right to seize\r\na caravan in a district where the Sultan, his master, has no authority,\r\ndecidedly neutral ground, especially a caravan of strangers. Then the\r\nSouafah, in revenge, may attack the caravans of Ghadames. Again, it is a\r\nquestion whether the caravan will come in without fighting, for the\r\nSouafah are tough men to deal with. It will be a poor excuse for the\r\nGovernor to plead before the Pasha, that the caravan was guilty of this\r\nhoax, supposing it so, and giving this as the reason for seizing the\r\npeaceable caravan of an independent state. Indeed, who shall decide that\r\nthey gave false intelligence of the Shânbah? And if they did, should this\r\nbe the punishment for spreading a false report? Many other disagreeable\r\nthoughts occur. It is clear there is a violent infraction of\r\ninternational law committed on our neighbour's (the Touarick's)\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nTalking with a gossip about the character of Moors, and he saying they\r\nwere \"_friends of flous_ (money,)\" _i. e._ mercenary, and adding that the\r\nTouattee was the best fellow amongst them. Said, who was present, said to\r\nme, \"Yes, it is so, and because he is a black man.\" Said often repeats to\r\nme, \"In Soudan it will cost you nothing to live; being a stranger,\r\neverybody will feed you in our country.\" Another free black took upon\r\nhimself to ridicule the constitution of the white man. \"Ah,\" he cried,\r\n\"what is a white man! a poor weak creature; he can't bear Soudan heat; he\r\ngets the fever, and dies. No, it is the black man that is strong, strong\r\nalways. He never droops or sinks! Look at the strength of my limbs.\" Such\r\nare the traits of character of coloured men in this Saharan world. I add\r\nanother anecdote. Speaking to Berka one day, I said, \"I shall have that\r\nTibboo himself sold as a slave; what right has he to bring people here as\r\nslaves and sell them?\" Berka mistook my meaning, thinking that, because\r\nthe Tibboo was black, I wished to have him sold and punished, and not for\r\nbeing a slave-dealer, and the old gentleman got into a great passion,\r\nsharply reprimanding me in this style: \"Yes, Christian! drop that\r\nlanguage; when you get to Soudan you will find everybody black. Drop that\r\nlanguage; don't fancy, because the Tibboo is black, you can sell him.\r\nDrop that language, for all are black there.\"\r\n\r\n_7th._--This morning, after a pursuit of three days, our soldiers brought\r\nin the Souf Arabs, which has made a great clamour in the town, as it\r\nalways happens in disputed cases, the people arranging themselves on\r\ndifferent sides as partisans, some for the Rais and others for the\r\nSouafah. Called upon the Governor and told him I hoped he would not take\r\nthe _gomerick_ (\"duties\") for the goods of the caravan, as the people\r\nwere brought here against their will. His Excellency said he would not,\r\nbut merely reprimand them for spreading false news. It appears there is\r\nsome slight evidence of a hoax, but nothing to justify such a violent\r\nmeasure. The Governor wants to make it out that they might have been\r\nShânbah, when it was well known before their capture they were Souafah.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the date-palm is turned to account. The fibrous net-work,\r\nwhich surrounds the ends of the branches where they attach themselves to\r\nthe trunk, is woven into very strong and tough ropes, with which the legs\r\nof camels are tied, and horses picketed. The very stones are split and\r\npounded, to fatten all animals here. The branches make baskets of every\r\nkind; the dried leaves are burned, and the trunk builds the houses,\r\nsupplying all the beams and rafters. One day, on looking up to some palm\r\nwood-work, the old men present said, \"How old do you think that wood is,\r\nYâkob?\" \"I can't tell,\" I replied. They observed, \"That wood is upwards\r\nof three hundred years old. Indeed, we can't tell how long it has been\r\nthere. Our grandfathers found it there, and it looked just the same then\r\nas now.\" It was large beams of the trunk of the tree, with platted thin\r\npieces of the boughs across them, forming a fantastic zig-zag joice of\r\nwood ceiling. The fruit of the date-palm supports man, in many oases,\r\nnine months out of twelve. In Fezzan, all the domestic animals, including\r\ndogs, and horses, and fowls, eat dates. Such are some of the various and\r\nimportant uses to which this noble tree is turned. The Saharan tribes,\r\nlikewise, are wont to live for several months of the year upon two other\r\nproducts, viz., milk and gum. Milk I have mentioned as supporting the\r\nTouaricks exclusively six or more months in the year. Gum, also, in the\r\nWestern Sahara, furnishes tribes with an exclusive sustenance for many\r\nmonths. Even the prickly-pear, or fruit of the cactus, will support a\r\nBarbary village for three months. It is, therefore, not surprising the\r\nIrish peasant may live on potatoes and milk the greater part of the year.\r\nThe bead on the date-stone is the part (vital) whence commences\r\ngermination, and sprouts the new shoots of the palm. New shoots spring up\r\nall over the oases, but particularly in those places where water is\r\nabundant, and within and about the ducts of irrigation. These shoots are\r\ncollected for the new plantations, and the female plants carefully\r\nseparated from the males, and these latter destroyed. Only a few male\r\nplants are kept for impregnation.\r\n\r\n_8th._--Warm this morning, the cold weather gone apparently for a short\r\ntime. No patients. The long-expected ghafalah from Tripoli has arrived by\r\nthe way of Derge, avoiding the more dangerous route of Seenawan, by which\r\nlatter I came here. No mail. All the people now in a hurry to be off to\r\nGhat, as their goods have arrived. I begin to feel extremely irritable\r\nand irresolute at the prospect of the new unknown Desert journey. The old\r\nbandit called, and asked, \"Well, are you going?\" I answered, \"Yes, very\r\nsoon, but I must first have a letter of permission from the Pasha of\r\nTripoli, so the Rais says, for the Pasha is greatly afraid you Touaricks\r\nwill cut my throat.\" \"God! God! God!\" exclaimed the bandit; \"I'll risk my\r\nhead that you'll go on safe to Ghat and Aheer. But, as for those\r\nvillains, the Touaricks of Timbuctoo, those, I'll grant you, are\r\ncut-throats.\" As I was about to take leave of the old brigand, I gave him\r\na piastre, and said, \"Now tell me fairly, and as an honest man, what is\r\nthe reason that the Touaricks kill Christians, and why did they kill the\r\nEnglish officer who went to Timbuctoo?\" \"Stop, stop,\" the brigand\r\nreplied, very pleased with the piastre, \"I'll tell you. There are three\r\nreasons. First (scratching with his spear on the ground), the Christians\r\nwill not say that Mahomet is the prophet of God. Second (again scratching\r\nwith his spear on the ground), the Christians are the brothers of\r\nPharaoh, and have plenty of money; we are poor, we kill you for your\r\nmoney. Third (again scratching), you wish to take our country. You have\r\nnearly all the world; you have robbed us of Algeria, and Andalous. Why\r\ndon't you stop in the sea, where you are? We shall not come to you. We\r\ndon't like the sea.\" Seeing I could make nothing of the old sinner, so\r\ncunning was he, I gave him a piece of sugar for his little son, and he\r\nwent away. I thought often of the words which I had recently read in the\r\nArabic, \"The time will come when those who kill you will think that they\r\nrender service to God,\" (John xvi. 2,) when discussing so repeatedly this\r\nquestion of the killing of Christians by the Touaricks with the Rais,\r\nwith the people of Ghadames, and with the Touaricks themselves. But has\r\nthis principle alone reference to the wild tribes of The Sahara? Has it\r\nnot had a pointed application in all the authenticated annals of the\r\nworld? Take our own era. The Jew thought he did service to God by killing\r\nthose who confessed Christ. Then the Imperial Roman, he immolated the\r\nChristian who worshipped not the image of Cæsar. Then the Roman Christian\r\nkilled the heretic Donatist, lighting up the flames of persecution in\r\nthis Africa. Then the Catholic killed the Protestant, and deluged Europe\r\nwith a sea of blood. Thus in England we enacted our penal laws against\r\nCatholics and Protestant Dissenters, some of which, to our shame, still\r\nexist on the statute book. What a horrid heritage of murder for\r\nconscience' sake has been transmitted to us in this nineteenth century?\r\nAnd is the present fratricidal war in Switzerland unconnected with this\r\nprinciple of blood and persecution! No; and again, no! How, then, can we\r\nfind fault with the barbarians of the Great Desert? Nay, contrarily,\r\nthose who follow me through The Desert, will find the Saharan Barbarians\r\ninfinitely more tolerant than the mild, and the gentle, and the polished,\r\nand the educated, and the civilized, and the Christianized professors of\r\nreligion in our own great Europe!\r\n\r\nThis afternoon the first portion of the Ghadamsee Soudanic caravan left\r\nfor Ghat, consisting of about twenty-five camels, and some ten merchants\r\nand traders. This is merely a detachment. The larger portion of the\r\npopulation went to see them off, and several families were dressed in\r\ntheir best clothes, as on festas. It is the usual custom on the departure\r\nand return of caravans. Two or three mounted on saddled Maharees\r\naccompanied the caravan a day's journey. I have many offers of the\r\npeople, as in The Mountains, to accompany me to Ghat: a strange\r\ninfatuation for such rigid Moslems as the Ghadamseeah!\r\n\r\nTo-day I witnessed in my court-yard or _patio_ a tremendous struggle\r\nbetween an ant and a fly: both species of insects are very numerous in\r\nGhadames, and there is a great number of various coloured ants. The ant\r\ngot hold of the muzzle of the fly, or its neck, and there grasped it with\r\nas firm a grasp as it is possible to conceive of one animal grasping\r\nanother. In vain the fly struggled and flapped its wings; over and over\r\nagain the combatants rolled as these weak defences beat the air: and yet\r\nthey must have had great force in them, for they flung over the ant, of a\r\ngood size, some hundred times. The struggle continued a full half hour. I\r\nonce or twice took them up on a piece of straw, but the ant never let go\r\nits hold on the fly, and paid no attention to me. At last, the fly was\r\nexhausted, and ceased to flap its tiny wings. The sanguinary ant\r\nstrangled the poor silly fly, as some sharper strangles or ruins his poor\r\ndupe. After death, the ant seemed busy at sucking its blood. Satiated\r\nwith this, the ant attempted to convey the fly away, dead as it was, but\r\nthinking better of the matter, the carcase was abandoned. I observed that\r\nthe combat went on in the midst of a thousand flies, but alas! these\r\nrendered their fellow, in this his death-struggle, against a common foe,\r\nno assistance. Such is the way the tyrants of the earth succeed! They\r\nstrike down the friends of freedom one by one, and the people, as silly\r\nas the flies, leave their champions to struggle alone against the common\r\noppressor of mankind, only thinking of what they shall eat and drink, in\r\nwhich fashion adorn themselves, and how they shall fill up sufficiently\r\nthe measure of their idle days of folly.\r\n\r\nThe whole phraseology of the Mediterranean is very loose in the\r\ndesignation of persons and objects. The Italians call every\r\nMussulman _un Turco_, \"a Turk.\" The French of Algeria call every\r\nMohammedan resident amongst them \"_un Arab_.\" So the Moors and Arabs\r\nhere call all people who are not Mussulmans _Ensara_, ‮الانصرا‬,\r\n\"Christians,\" whether Pagans, Idolaters, or what not. I was writing\r\nsome information from the mouth of a Moor, and got into a scrape. He\r\ntold me there were plenty of _Ensara_ in Soudan, and I thought\r\nthese might be Abyssinian Christians, until I reflected that it was\r\nmerely the ordinary denomination of those who are not Moslemites.\r\n\r\n_9th._--Slept very little during the past night; always dreaming of\r\nTimbuctoo. The further an object is from you the nearer it is to your\r\nthoughts. The morning broke with a violent wind from the south-east,\r\nwhich is exceedingly disagreeable. Rais continues very gracious, and\r\nsends me constantly cakes, being a portion of what he receives as\r\npresents from the people.\r\n\r\nI omit a great deal about Souf politics, not being anxious to worry the\r\nreader with French and Tuniseen Saharan diplomacy. But a Souafee's notion\r\nof hospitality is rather, I should think, rigid. I said to a Souafee,\r\nwhose acquaintance I have made, \"I shall come to your country, and write\r\nall about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you dare,\" he replied, \"by G--d, the people will immediately cut your\r\nthroat.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"I will get an _amer_ ('order') from the Bey of Tunis, which will\r\nprotect me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" rejoined the Souafee, \"the people will tear the amer to pieces,\r\nand set the Bey, the French, and all Christians, at defiance.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the Souafah, the most interesting Arabs of all this region, are\r\nvery fierce of their independence, which explains their jealousy of the\r\nFrench, and their determinedly withholding any mark of sovereignty, in\r\nthe way of tribute, from the Bey of Tunis. It appears, however, two or\r\nthree of the small districts have really consented to pay a tribute to\r\nthe French, an act of decided usurpation on the part of France, as the\r\nSouf oases \"formerly did acknowledge\" the sovereignty of Tunis. It is,\r\nnevertheless, a pleasing trait in the character of the Souafah, that they\r\nhave permitted some thirty families of Jews to settle amongst them, a\r\nconcession not yet made by the Marabouts of Ghadames.\r\n\r\nWithin my couple of months' residence here, how rapid has been the\r\nimpoverishment of the country! Everything gets worse and worse. Now, it\r\nis almost impossible to get change for a Tunisian piastre. I've been two\r\ndays trying to get change, and have not yet succeeded. The money in\r\ncirculation is principally Tunisian piastres; but since the Turks have\r\ncome, Turkish money also passes. There are, besides, a quantity of\r\nSpanish dollars and five-franc pieces. Apparently, all the money has left\r\nthe country, or is hidden by the people. A good deal, I have no doubt,\r\nhas been hidden within a few weeks. The Governor himself laments that he\r\nchanged a dollar yesterday for two karoubs (two pence) less than its\r\ncurrent value in Tripoli. His Excellency is very low-spirited, and very\r\nsick. His Excellency prays that the Pasha will allow him to return to\r\nTripoli a few months. Being a good man, the system of extortion which he\r\nis obliged to put in practice to meet the demands of the Pasha, makes his\r\nheart sick. His Excellency assured me, that if the Souf Arabs had not\r\nlately brought some money, with which they purchased slaves for the\r\nmarkets of Algeria, there would have been no money left in the country.\r\nThe merchants say their affairs must now be transacted in the way of\r\nbarter, as in Soudan. I am particular in noticing these things, and the\r\ncause of the impoverishment of these unhappy people, as showing the curse\r\nof the Turkish system on the transactions of commerce.\r\n\r\nMy taleb wrote in my journal this splendid Arabic proverb:\r\n\r\nالرجال سناديق مغلقة ومفاتحها التجريب صدور الرجال\r\n    سنادق الاسرار\r\n\r\n\"Men are locked-up boxes--experience opens them; the bosom of man is a\r\nbox of secrets.\"\r\n\r\n_10th._--To-day I ran about town to tire myself, in order to sleep at\r\nnights. This morning, one of the two expected ghafalahs of Tripoli,\r\nconsisting of 117 camels and twenty traders of Ghadames, arrived; the\r\nother ghafalah will arrive in a few days. The ghafalah has brought goods\r\nonly for the interior. The merchants just come report in town, \"That\r\nYâkob (myself) has written to the English Consul of Tripoli, informing\r\nhim how _Aaron_ (_Signor Silva_) lends money and goods to the merchants\r\nof Ghadames, with which goods and money to go into the interior, and\r\ntraffick in slaves.\" This is substantially correct; but it was written in\r\nconfidence to Colonel Warrington, and to no other person in Tripoli. I\r\nexpressly begged Colonel Warrington not to divulge the fact, or my\r\nmention of such a matter, until I was out of the lion's mouth of the\r\nslave-dealing interests of this part of North Africa. The Consul,\r\nhowever, deemed it his duty to disregard my request, and to divulge or\r\nviolate this confidence, and posted up a placard on the door of the\r\nTripoline Consulate, stating, \"That certain merchants, under British\r\nprotection, were accused of slave-dealing with the merchants of Ghadames,\r\nand calling upon them to clear themselves from such an imputation.\" Of\r\ncourse, as there was nobody else likely to make such an accusation but\r\nmyself, being well known as an anti-slavery man in Tripoli, the public\r\nattention was at once directed to me as the accuser. The other merchant\r\nalluded to is Mr. Laby (Levi), a Barbary Jew, and the head of a house in\r\nTripoli. Mr. Silva is also a Jew, but from Europe. This report,\r\ncirculating from mouth to mouth, has created a tremendous sensation in\r\nGhadames; and the people fancy they see in it not only a blow aimed at\r\nthem and the slave-trade, but the final ruin of their commerce, already\r\nsufficiently crippled by the oppression of the Turks. I am, therefore,\r\nobliged to Colonel Warrington, not so much for facilitating my progress\r\nin the interior, as for increasing my difficulties a hundred-fold. I was\r\nastonished that a high functionary, of thirty-three years' experience in\r\nthese countries, should have committed such an act of egregious\r\nindiscretion, exposing the life of a fellow countryman to such increased\r\ndanger, who was already without any kind of guaranteed protection. If I\r\nhad been murdered in The Desert tract from Ghadames to Ghat, it would\r\nhave most justly been attributed to the placard placed on the doors of\r\nthe Consulate at Tripoli. Justice requires from me, however, that I\r\nshould state an indiscretion also on my part. I wrote to the Consul that\r\nI had communicated the charge against Messrs. Silva and Levi to the\r\nSecretary of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, and did not\r\nadd, as I ought perhaps to have done, that I had likewise begged of Mr.\r\nScoble not to make the charge public for the present. Colonel Warrington\r\nwas afraid the charge would be known in London before he had reported\r\nupon it, and in this way his Consulate might suffer in the eyes of\r\nGovernment. Now I shall not trouble the reader with the proof of the\r\ncharge. It must already have been seen, that as the merchants of Ghadames\r\nare drained of all their capital by the Turkish Government, they, the\r\nmerchants of Ghadames, are obliged to fall back upon the merchants of\r\nTripoli, who will give them credit, some of which latter are under\r\nBritish protection. So Sheikh Makouran complained to me he could not now\r\ntrade without the credit of Silva, so the people told me the house of\r\nEttanee, the other great mercantile firm of this country, had received\r\nseveral thousand dollars' worth of goods on credit from the Messrs. Laby,\r\nand so the Rais frequently has told me, the money of the merchants of\r\nGhadames is in the holding of those of Tripoli, who are mostly under\r\nEuropean protection. The question is, whether such a state of things can\r\nbe brought under the provision of Lord Brougham's Act, for preventing\r\nBritish merchants from trading in slaves, or aiding others to trade in\r\nslaves, in foreign countries. It is a very delicate subject, because the\r\nmodes of evading the Act, by private and secret contracts, are\r\ninnumerable. British juries are also unwilling to convict parties under\r\nthis Act, and the case of Zulueta failed not so much from the want of\r\nevidence as from the unwillingness of the jury to come to an impartial\r\ndecision on the evidence.\r\n\r\nWhilst reflecting upon my very critical position, my poor Said came in\r\nfrom the streets very much cast down, and very sulky.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" blubbered Said, \"the people are all talking about your telling the\r\nConsul that the Jews lend them goods to trade in slaves. They hate you\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" I returned, \"it will pass away soon.\"\r\n\r\nSaid had already become a staunch abolitionist, both from principle and\r\ncircumstances, and often asked me, \"When the English would put down the\r\nslave-trade in Tripoli?\" Said is by no means so stupid as I first took\r\nhim to be. I immediately determined not to go out for two or three days\r\nuntil the excitement had somewhat abated. In the evening I had many\r\nvisitors, who all spoke of my accusation against Levi and Silva. I met\r\nthe accusations by a deprecatory proposal of this kind: \"Would the\r\nGhadamsee merchants consent to abandon the traffic in slaves, on the\r\nconditions that some English merchants would furnish them with goods on\r\ncredit at a lower rate than that which they obtained them from Levi and\r\nSilva: if so, I would write about it to the Consul? And, likewise, I\r\nwould ask the Consul to get their Soudan goods charged only five per\r\ncent. importation, which was the sum paid for European goods coming into\r\nTripoli; thereby equalizing the per centage of the imports and exports.\"\r\nMy merchant friends received this proposal very favourably, and swore\r\nthere was no profit in slaves, and declared themselves ready to give up\r\nthe traffic. Some proposed that they should try the gold trade of\r\nTimbuctoo, and leave the Soudan trade altogether. The traffic to Soudan\r\nis two-thirds in slaves or more. I knew, however, that to expect such a\r\nthing from the Turks, was all but hopeless,--their grand maxim of\r\nGovernment being to depress and to destroy, not to help and build\r\nup,--and I made to them the proposition chiefly with the object of\r\ndiverting the odium of the accusation from myself. But yet, who does not\r\nsee that the proposal is well worthy the attention of any Government\r\nthat wishes to establish in Africa a legitimate commerce, a system of\r\ntrade which a good man and a good Government may approve of and support?\r\n\r\nSixty Arab soldiers came yesterday from The Mountains to protect the\r\npeople whilst they are building the caravansary of Emjessem. A merchant\r\nmade a present to-day of some slave neck-irons and leg-irons to the Rais.\r\nHis Excellency said to me, \"I had none before, it was necessary to have\r\nsome of these things, in case they should be wanted for the banditti who\r\nmight be captured.\" A person justly observed, \"Before the _Truk_ (Turks)\r\nwe had no need of these things, except for runaway slaves, and we seldom\r\nused them.\" The Irishman who discovered himself to be in a civilized\r\ncountry from the erection of a gallows, might have equally proved the\r\nadvance of civilization in The Sahara from this fact.\r\n\r\n_11th._--Feel greatly discomposed on account of the news which has\r\ntranspired respecting the joint dealings of Silva and Levi with our\r\nGhadamsee merchants. One trouble succeeds another, as the angry waves\r\nbeating on the rocky shore. First the pain of delay, then sickness, now\r\nother matters, then the prospect of a dangerous journey through The\r\nDesert, with a people who may look upon me with dislike, distrust, and\r\nevery kind of suspicion. . . . . . In the past night, blew a gale from\r\nthe north-west. Slept very little. Also troubled with a large boil.\r\nReceived a visit from some of my old Arab friends of the Rujban\r\nMountains, who regaled themselves with bread and dates. Called on the\r\nRais, who was as friendly as ever. If his Excellency have heard the\r\nreport, he has the delicacy to say nothing about it. His Excellency told\r\nme he had dispatched ninety-two _shatahs_, or mails, during the fifteen\r\nmonths which he has been in Ghadames. It is reported in town, that Signor\r\nSilva is in a great fright, and fears being arrested by the British\r\nConsul at the order of the Queen. A notary visited me to-day, laughed at\r\nthe news of Silva, and was very friendly; he protested the people got\r\nnothing by slave-dealing. Begin to feel relieved, but I see clearly some\r\ndiscouraging circumstances. My taleb comes in as usual, but the turjeman\r\nis frightened and keeps away. Several of the merchants positively affirm,\r\nthat now, since the market of Tunis is shut, and the Pasha takes ten\r\ndollars duty on each slave, there is no profit in slave-dealing. However,\r\nnews has arrived from Ghat that a great many slaves are coming with the\r\nnext caravan from Soudan.\r\n\r\nThis evening was glad to go with the Rais to see the ruins of\r\n_Kesar-El-Ensara_, ‮قصر الانصرا‬, \"The Castle of the\r\nChristians,\" although I had seen them often before. It was a great\r\nrelief to me. The Rais put his head down to the vaults under the\r\nruins to listen to the conversation of the _Jenoun_, or \"Demons.\"\r\nHis Excellency said he thought he heard the Demons talking. The\r\nruins are situate about half a mile from the walls of the city S.SW.\r\nAll the piles have a small vault under them, apparently for water,\r\nbut it might have been an excavated tomb. The people pretend that\r\nthese ruins are four thousand years of age. A son of the late Yousef\r\nBashaw, on a visit to Ghadames, about thirty years ago, to amuse\r\nhimself and frighten the demons, blew up a large portion of the\r\nruins with gunpowder. Previously the ruins were much more perfect\r\nand imposing. I have made a sketch of what remains of these ancient\r\nbuildings. The style of the buildings can be easily distinguished\r\nfrom the modern by its being composed of a very white cement and\r\nsmall stones, half the size of ordinary paving stones, the cement\r\nbeing in a large proportion. My turjeman once pointed out to me a\r\npiece of the ancient walls of the city, still remaining, exactly\r\ncorresponding to these ruins. I have seen frequent ruins of ancient\r\nRoman walls, representing the same kind of building in North Africa.\r\nThis Kesar-El-Ensara, together with the bas-relief, and the Latin\r\ninscription, copied by a Moor from a tomb-stone, beginning with the\r\nwords \"_Diis Manibus_,\" are more than sufficient evidence to prove\r\nthat Ghadames was \"colonized,\" as it was called, by the Romans, and\r\nprobably earlier by the Greeks and Carthaginians. The same Moorish\r\nprince who blew up the ruins, carried away also to Tripoli the\r\ntomb-stone, from which a Moor copied the inscription, and which\r\ntranscript I brought with me from Ghadames. The copyist of this\r\ninscription says, he affixed the Arabic letters in order that the\r\nMussulman might compare them with the Christian letters and find out\r\ntheir sense, but he himself did not know what were their meaning. On\r\nreturning from Kesar-El-Ensara, we looked around and were painfully\r\nimpressed with the appalling barrenness of The Sahara. The Rais\r\nsaid, \"Ah, these people, little know they what a garden is my\r\ncountry compared to this!\" The Rais then stumbled over a small\r\nsolitary herb and exclaimed instinctively, _Hamdullah_, \"Praise to\r\nGod,\" picking it up. What attracted our attention was the almost\r\ninfinite number of small serpentine camel-tracks, wriggling\r\nendlessly through the wastes of The Sahara. The Rais said, \"Those\r\nTouaricks are incarnate Genii! they know all these paths:\" pointing\r\nsouth towards Ghat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGhadames, ‮غدامس‬, is the ancient _Cydamus_, the name being\r\nprecisely the same. In the year 19 before our era, it was subjugated\r\nby Cornelius Balbus, being at that period in the possession of a\r\npeople called Garamtes. The Romans are said to have embellished it,\r\nand probably built the fortifications whose ruins have been just\r\ndescribed. In an ancient itinerary, from Tunis to Ghadames, we find\r\nthe following names of stations, viz., Berezeos, Ausilincli, Agma,\r\nAugemmi, Tabalata, Thebelami and Tillibari. Leo Africanus, gives the\r\nsubjoined account of Ghadames:\r\n\r\nGADEMES, ABITAZIONE.--Gademes è una grande abitazione, dove sono molti\r\ncastelli e popolosi casali, discosti dal mare Mediterraneo, verso\r\nmezzogiorno, circa a trecento miglia. Gli abitatori sono ricchi di\r\npossessioni di datteri, e di danari, perciocchè sogliono mercatantare nel\r\npaese de' Negri: e si reggono da lor medesimi, e pagano tributo agli\r\nArabi; ma prima erano sotto il re di Tunis, cioè il luogotenente di\r\nTripoli. E vero che quivi il grano e la carne sono molto cari.--(Part\r\nvi., chap. Lii.)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[56] In the Tunisian Jereed there are more than two hundred\r\n    different varieties. Some thrive in one kind of soil, and some in\r\n    another. At first it is difficult for a stranger to distinguish\r\n    these varieties, but when his eye becomes practised, he can easily\r\n    do so at a great distance.\r\n\r\n[57] _Ghusub_, ‮قسب‬, a species of millet. _Pennisetum Tyhoideum._\r\n    Rich.

Sorry I can't read during the\r\nnights on account of my eyes. But somewhat improved in health. Saw\r\nseveral merchants who say nothing of the Levi and Silva business. I'm in\r\nhopes this subject will not be agitated during the few days I have to\r\nremain in Ghadames. The second ghafalah has arrived but brings me\r\nnothing, not even the medicines ordered from Tripoli. Patience! What can\r\nbe done? The Governor affected this evening to be very indignant against\r\nthe son of Yousef Bashaw for destroying the ruins of Kesar-El-Ensarah.\r\nThe Turks are becoming antiquaries, and, perhaps, begin to see the\r\nuselessness and folly of destroying ancient buildings for the sake of\r\ndestroying them, even though they belong to an infidel age. To their\r\ncredit, the Moors themselves are fond of antiquity in churches, and will\r\npatch up a marabet or mosque as long as they can. The Rais, still\r\nfrightened, suggests that I should return to Tripoli. But I cannot now, I\r\nwill not. I ought not, for I have acted over all the pains and perils of\r\nthe journey to Soudan many days and nights, and exhausted myself with\r\nexpectations, casualties, probabilities and conceivabilities, &c., &c. I\r\nam now, in truth, suffering all sorts of maladies, mental and bodily.\r\nSuch is the wretched existence we are doomed to sustain! And yet is not\r\nthis our mortal existence a still greater curse to the man, who lives\r\nwithout an object and without an aim?\r\n\r\n_13th._--Talk of heat and the burning desert, I had last night an attack\r\nof cold, which I shall not forget to the latest day of my life! My limbs\r\nall shrunk together, my teeth chattered, and I did not know what pains or\r\ndisease was about to come upon me. This happened whilst undressing. I\r\nimmediately dressed myself in all my thickest heaviest clothes, lay down,\r\nand in twenty minutes happily recovered from the attack. But scarcely\r\nslept all night, got a few winks of sleep this morning. I attribute all\r\nthis to the nervous agitation of advancing into The Desert without a\r\nguide or friend, on whom I can rely, combined with the severity of the\r\nseason fast setting in. Glad to see the sensation of the Silva business\r\ndying away. People begin to laugh at me about it, and call the Consul\r\n_Sheytan_ for disclosing the purport of a letter written confidentially\r\nto him. However, I cannot conceive that Colonel Warrington was influenced\r\nby any other feelings than those which resulted from a strict sense of\r\nduty. Apparently zealous in the performance of his public avocations, he\r\nwas determined to discharge them at any cost, even at the sacrifice of\r\nthe life of a fellow-countryman. This is all I can now say about the\r\nmatter. Fortunately I was well known here, and the people could not\r\nbelieve that it was from any ill-will to them that I denounced the\r\nparties, which I hope the reader will give me credit for; nor, indeed,\r\ncould I have any hostile feelings against the Tripoline merchants. What I\r\nwish, and I imagine every friend of Africa does the same, is to see a\r\nlegitimate commerce established in The Desert. It is curious to hear the\r\nTouatee. He says he is sure I never wrote the letter at all, although I\r\ntell him I did, and believes it an invention of people in Tripoli. He\r\nwon't believe his friend Yâkob would breathe a syllable against the\r\npeople of Ghadames.\r\n\r\n_14th._--Slept very little during the night and cannot. Am really reduced\r\nto very low disagreeable feelings. Have an immense boil on my back, and\r\nanother on my arm, which I attribute to the effect of the climate on my\r\nconstitution, or to drinking Ghadames water.\r\n\r\nNews have come of the Shânbah having left their sandy wilds on a\r\nfree-booting expedition, leaving only the old men, women, and children\r\nbehind, for these banditti propagate through all time a race of Saharan\r\nrobbers, the scourge of The Desert. Five weeks ago they took their\r\ndeparture towards Ghat, and it is thought they wish to intercept our\r\ncaravan now leaving. Also a skirmish has taken place between some Souafah\r\nbanditti and Arabs of Algeria. These banditti were routed, leaving\r\neighteen dead on the field and many camels.\r\n\r\nAn ostrich, caught at Seenawan, has been brought in here and presented\r\nto the Rais. His Excellency promised to give him to me if I will return\r\nfrom Soudan _viâ_ Ghadames. He is a young bird and amuses us much,\r\nrunning about the streets, picking up things in character of scavenger.\r\nPeople are trying to make him lie down at the word of command. \"Kaed,\r\n(lie down),\" cries one, \"Kaed,\" another; at length the stunned and\r\nstupefied bird lies down.\r\n\r\n_16th._--Occupied 13th, 14th, and 15th in writing letters. Received a\r\nletter from Dr. Dickson, of Tripoli, expressing friendly feelings. He has\r\nprepared some more medicines, packed them up, and charged them to me.\r\nReceived a very friendly letter also from Colli, Sardinian Consul at\r\nTripoli. Mr. Colli is a fine classical scholar, and the only consul I\r\nhave met with in North Africa who pays any attention to classical\r\nliterature. The late Mr. Hay of Tangier, had the reputation amongst some\r\npeople of being a classical scholar.\r\n\r\nContinue unwell and in low spirits, or as the Negroes say, am possessed\r\nby the _Boree_ (\"blue devils.\") Days are short, and nights tedious and\r\npainful to me, as I cannot use my eyes by lamp-light, on account of a\r\nslight continued ophthalmia. Nothing remarkable to-day. If you want to\r\nfeel alone in the world, which at times has its advantages, go into The\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\n_17th._--To my great satisfaction the mail arrived this morning, bringing\r\nletters and newspapers. The Governor is very friendly and is in better\r\nhealth. Quarrelled with Ben Mousa, my taleb, for eating Said's dinner\r\nwhen I was out of the way; to-day Said got him reconciled to me. Haj\r\nMansour's family consists of thirty-two persons, all living in one house.\r\nThis is the great _quasi_ negro-merchant before mentioned. His father\r\ndied a Saharan veteran of the age of one hundred and one. He had been\r\nmore than a hundred times over The Desert trading. Yesterday died a man\r\nat the age of ninety-six. There are several women now living more than\r\neighty. How long these poor creatures survive their feminine charms! A\r\nwoman in The Desert gets old after thirty. I think, from what I have\r\nheard, people live to a great age in this and other oases--if not to a\r\ngood and happy old age. Some remarkable cases of longevity in The Desert\r\nhave been narrated by Captain Riley. Said says the people rob us\r\ndesperately when they make our bread. We usually buy the wheat and have\r\nit ground and made into bread at the same time. I tell Said we must\r\nexpect this sort of pilfering where there are so many hungry people.\r\n\r\nMy taleb began his interminable discussions on religion. He said he had\r\nhoped that I should have recognized Mahomet as the prophet of God, being\r\nacquainted as I was with Arabic, the language of truth and unmatched by\r\nany language in the world[58]. I replied language was not enough, other\r\nthings were necessary; besides, indeed, some of the Mussulman doctors had\r\nsaid the Koran could be imitated and even excelled. The taleb replied, \"A\r\nlie! the doctors were heretics and infidels, it is impossible to imitate\r\nthe Koran's beautiful language,\" citing the well-known words of\r\nMahomet:--\r\n\r\n\"_Answer._--Bring therefore a chapter like unto it; and call whom you\r\nmay to your assistance, besides God, if ye speak the truth.\"--(Surat ii.,\r\nentitled \"Jonas.\")\r\n\r\nThe taleb then turned to my turjeman, who was present, and cited another\r\npassage, thinking I did not understand what it was. The passage quoted\r\nwas the famous anathema of judicial blindness denounced against\r\ninfidels:--\r\n\r\n\"As to the unbelievers, it will be equal to them whether thou admonish\r\nthem, or do not admonish them; they will not believe. God hath sealed up\r\ntheir hearts and their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and they\r\nshall suffer a grievous punishment.\"--(Surat ii., entitled \"the Cow.\")\r\n\r\nThis is evidently an imitation[59] of our Scriptural passages, of which\r\nthere are several:\r\n\r\n\"Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,\r\nsaying, Go unto this people and say, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not\r\nunderstand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive. For the heart of\r\nthis people has waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and\r\ntheir eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and\r\nhear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be\r\nconverted, and I should heal them.\"--(Acts xxviii. 25, 26, 27.) So we\r\nhave in John x. 26:--\"But you believe not because you are not of my\r\nsheep.\"\r\n\r\nBesides these imitations, Mahomet has made differences for the sake of\r\ndifferences. So the Sabbath of the Moslemites is on the Friday, because\r\nthat of the Christians and Jews is on the Saturday and Sunday. I taxed my\r\ntaleb with his quotation. He did not flinch or blink a hair of the\r\neyelid, but said, \"You Christians cannot believe if you would, because\r\nGod has blinded your eyes and hardened your hearts.\" \"Why do you complain\r\nof us?\" I remonstrated. \"I do not complain,\" he rejoined, \"it is all\r\ndestined.\" I then related a story of predestination which I had heard, of\r\none man asking another, \"If all things were predestined?\" and he\r\nreplying, \"Yes;\" the questioner immediately threw him out of the window,\r\nsaying, \"Well, that is also predestined.\" An old Moor sitting by, very\r\nattentively listening, exclaimed immediately, \"Well, even that throwing\r\nout of the window, Yâkob, was also predestined.\" Said then brought in\r\nsome stewed meat. I gave my theological disputants, reasoning--\r\n\r\n    \"Of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate,\r\n     Fix'd fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,\r\n     And found no end, in wandering mazes lost,\"\r\n\r\nsome bread, and they began breaking it and dipping it in the gravy of the\r\nmeat, the invariable custom here. Spoons they abominate, it is either\r\ntheir fingers, or sopping. The Biblical reader will easily recognize the\r\ncustom. I took the Testament and read to the taleb this passage:--\"And,\"\r\nsaid Jesus, \"He it is to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it;\r\nand he took a sop and gave it to Judas Simon Iscariot.\"--(John xiii. 26.)\r\n\r\nThe taleb was greatly delighted, and said, \"Yes, so it was in all times\r\nbefore the infidels introduced knives and forks and spoons to eat with.\"\r\nI observed it was much more cleanly to eat with knives and forks than\r\nwith one's fingers, but it was useless. He only replied, \"There's water\r\nalways to wash your hands.\" The sop mentioned in the passage cited might\r\nconsist of a piece of bread dipped into a dish of fat or broth. So all\r\nGhadames people eat, dipping pieces of bread, as they break them from a\r\nloaf, into fat or broth, or other dishes of this sort. We shall find, for\r\nwhat cause I cannot tell, the Touaricks using spoons, and spoons which\r\nare made in Central Africa, and distributed throughout The Sahara amongst\r\nthe Touarghee tribes. This little circumstance would seem to be an\r\nargument against the Oriental origin of the Touaricks, for, eternally\r\ndipping and sopping, and sopping and dipping with the fingers, is\r\ncoextensive with the migrations of the Arabs and other tribes from the\r\nEast. Jews were the first to introduce knives and forks into Mogador,\r\nbecause they have not the same religious scruples on this head as\r\nMohammedans. Barbary Jews do it in imitation of their European brethren.\r\nI shall trouble the reader with another display of the sectarian zeal of\r\nmy taleb.\r\n\r\nTo make a proposition, or a double proposition, of a form of the orthodox\r\nChristian faith, I had constructed the following, in imitation of the\r\ndouble proposition of the Mahometans, (that is--\r\n\r\n     ‮لا لله الّا الله ومحمّد رسول الله‬\r\n    \"There is one God, and Mahomet is the prophet of God,\")\r\n\r\n     ‮لا لله الّا الله ويسوع ابن الله‬\r\n    \"There is one God, and Jesus is the son of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe first proposition is seen to be the same; whilst the divine\r\nnature of the Saviour, which is the distinguishing feature of the\r\nChristian religion as looked upon by Mussulmans, is added in the words\r\n‮ابن الله‬. The number of syllables is precisely the same, the\r\n‮و‬ being merely considered as the connecting link of the two\r\npropositions. But the term ‮عيسي‬ would be much preferable to\r\n‮يسوع‬, being the classic Arabic term. In teaching Christian\r\ndoctrine to Mussulmans, and, indeed, to all people, it is necessary\r\nto adapt our style and language to their style and language and mode\r\nof conception. The Catholics, however, carried the adaptation too\r\nfar when they turned the statues of Jupiter and the Emperors into\r\nthose of the Apostles and Saints. For the Jews, the proposition\r\ncould be made thus:--\r\n\r\n     ‮لا لله الّا الله ويسوع هو المسيح‬\r\n    \"There is one God, and Jesus is the Messiah;\"\r\n\r\nor as we find the proposition in the first verse of the first chapter of\r\nSt. Mark,\r\n\r\n     ‮[لا لله الّا الله]  ويسوع المسيح ابن الله‬\r\n    \"There is one God, and Jesus, the Messiah, is the Son of God.\"\r\n\r\nThis, being more full of doctrine, including both the divinity\r\nand Messiahship of The Saviour, would, perhaps, be the preferable\r\nform of the latter proposition. I showed the taleb these\r\npropositions, and he was greatly exasperated, adding it was\r\nblasphemy to connect Christian and Jewish ideas with \"the Word of God\"\r\n(‮كلام الله‬). He added, oddly enough, \"Such impious things\r\nhad never been before done in this holy place, this sacred Ghadames.\"\r\n\r\n_18th._--The Rais makes a last effort to persuade me to return to The\r\nMountains, and take the route of Fezzan, adding as a reason, which\r\ntourists would very properly consider an objection, \"that I knew now the\r\nroute to The Mountains.\" I rejoined, \"From what I have seen of the people\r\nof Ghadames, and even the Touaricks, I think I may trust them as well as\r\nthe people of Tripoli.\" _The Rais_: \"Well, you are your own master; the\r\nPasha says you may go if you like. The Ghadamseeah and Touaricks are one\r\npeople; make friends with them. But I'm sorry, after you have seen all my\r\nkindness to you, my advice is nevertheless rejected.\" The Rais now saw I\r\nwas inexorable, and left off advising.\r\n\r\nTo-day some wild-ox, _bughar wahoush_[60],--‮بقر وحوش‬ was\r\nbrought in from The Desert. This is the hunting time, which lasts three\r\nmonths, and the flesh of this animal supplies a very good substitute\r\nfor beef. Indeed, the animal is a species of buffalo, but very\r\nsmall, sometimes not much larger than a good-sized English sheep.\r\nThey are hunted in the sands to the north-west by Souf Arabs, who\r\nare excellent hunters, and pursue the chase twenty days together\r\nthrough the sandy regions. People pretend the bughar wahoush does\r\nnot drink; perhaps they don't drink much. But both the wild ox and\r\nthe aoudad are occasionally caught near the wells, a sufficient\r\nproof they sometimes drink water. I cooked some, and found it of\r\nexcellent flavour. People call this animal also medicine. I\r\npurchased half of one to salt for my journey to Ghat, but spoilt it\r\nby too much salting. The salt ate away all the flesh from the bones.\r\nI neglected the advice of Said, who assured me people salt meat very\r\nlittle in Soudan. Indeed, they frequently cut the meat into strips\r\nand dry it in the sun without salting. In this way caravans are\r\nprovisioned over The Desert. I ate some, and found it very good. My\r\nArab friend, the old doctor, brought me a small prickly shrub, which\r\nhe calls _El-Had_, ‮الحد‬, and says it has powerful purgative\r\nqualities, purging even the camels. It abounds in The Sahara.\r\n\r\nWe, The Desert Quack and English Quack, bandy compliments together.\r\n\r\n_Desert Quack._--\"Whilst you are here, you are the Sublime Doctor\r\n(Ettabeeb Elâttheem).\" [As much as to say, \"When you are not here, I am\r\nThe Sublime Doctor.\"]\r\n\r\n_English Quack._--\"How? No, you are always The Sublime Doctor. I am at\r\nyour disposal. I am your slave.\"\r\n\r\n_Desert Quack._--\"Impossible! Haram, it is prohibited. You are the wise\r\ndoctor, you know all things.\"\r\n\r\n_English Quack._--\"How many people have you killed by your physic?\"\r\n\r\n_Desert Quack_ [surprised at this abrupt and impertinent question].--\"God\r\nforefend that I should kill any one! But sometimes _Rubbee_ (God) takes\r\naway my patients, and sometimes they get better. But whether they die or\r\nlive, people always say, 'It is written (predestined).'\"\r\n\r\nI then related the story of Gil Blas, who bled to death the rich lady,\r\nunder the precepts of Dr. San Grado, and was challenged in mortal combat\r\nby the suitor of the fair dame. On which he observed, \"Gil Blas was a\r\ndog. I trust the other man killed him. Here we bleed, but we always know\r\nwhen blood enough is left in a man to keep him alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\" I replied.\r\n\r\n_The Taleb._--\"1st. I see if he sinks down. 2nd. I ask Rubbee. 3rd.\r\nSometimes the Jenoun (demons) tell me. 4th. If he dies, what matter? Is\r\nit not the will of God?\"\r\n\r\n_19th._--Great preparations are now going on for the departure of the\r\nghafalah to Ghat and Soudan. An order has come from the Pasha, that the\r\nRais may take 2,500 instead of 3,250, less 750. This the people must pay.\r\nAnd I hear the poor wretches have at last consented to swallow the bitter\r\npill. Every man, having a small property, or a householder, will pay each\r\nfive mahboubs; the merchants considerably more. A little by little, till\r\nthe vitals of this once flourishing oasis are torn out, and it becomes as\r\ndead as The Desert around it.\r\n\r\n_20th._--This morning a slave ghafalah arrives from Ghat with forty\r\nslaves. Two escaped _en route_. What could the poor creatures do in\r\nThe Desert? They must have perished very soon. The ghafalah brings\r\nimportant news. The Shânbah, 700 strong, had been ravaging the\r\ncountry of the Ghat Touaricks, and had murdered thirty-seven people.\r\nThe Touaricks were arming, and in pursuit of the Shânbah assassins.\r\nBesides this, the Shânbah have captured a Ghadamsee ghafalah,\r\nescorted by Touaricks, not respecting a jot the Maraboutish\r\ncharacter of this city. It consisted of thirty camels, laden mostly\r\nwith the property of our merchants. Sheikh Makouran himself lost\r\n2,000 mahboubs. Total loss for the merchants here is about 15,000\r\ndollars. It is the caravan which left these two months ago, and took\r\na letter for me to the Governor of Ain Salah. Both letters have been\r\nunlucky; the one sent to Ghat could not be delivered because the\r\nGovernor was changed; and this one, I imagine, has fallen into the\r\nhands of the Shânbah. Two slaves escaped with a water-skin. They\r\nthen fell in with some Touaricks, who gave them a little bread, and\r\nin this dreadful plight they got to Ghat. One died after his\r\narrival. What became of the Touaricks is not yet known. They are\r\nprobably massacred. I made the acquaintance of these luckless\r\nTouaricks, and gave them some medicine to take to Touat. In this\r\nforay the Shânbah killed a little child of three years old. When\r\nthey struck down a man, they ripped open his belly and left him.\r\nThese Shânbah banditti (who, to my surprise, are lauded in the\r\nFrench works published by the Minister of War, as the most\r\nenterprising camel-drivers and merchants in The Sahara,) are,\r\nwithout doubt, what the people say here, the vilest and most\r\nbloodthirsty miscreants in The Desert. How strange it is they are\r\nArabs! It is always the Arab, who is the most thorough-going,\r\nhereditary, eternal robber of The Desert! Is it because we read,\r\n\"And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and\r\nevery man's hand against him?\" The disposition for brigandage in\r\nthe soul of the Arab was a proverb of Jewish antiquity. So we have,\r\n‮כַּעֳרָבִי בַּמִּדְבַּר‬, \"As the Arabian in the Wilderness.\" My\r\nArabic translation, which was done by the Missionaries of the Roman\r\nChurch, follows some of the ancient versions, and renders it ‮مثل\r\nاللّص‬ \"like the thief in the Desert\" (See Jeremiah iii. 2.) Still,\r\nMr. D'Israeli thinks there's nothing like Arab blood, if we read\r\naright his \"Tancred,\" and would have us regenerate the old effete\r\nrace of Europe by this fiery and bloodthirsty Oriental barbarian, as\r\nthe Arabian stallion improves our dull race of horses. It is\r\nreported, in town, \"When the Shânbah cut to pieces the thirty-seven\r\nTouaricks, one man was left untouched amidst the slaughter, owing\r\nhis safety to his _Ajab_, ‮عجب‬ (amulets), which he wore in great\r\nprofusion.\" This lucky charm-clad fellow saw the whole business from\r\nfirst to last, unmoved amidst the commingled cries of the victims\r\nand their slaughterers, and made a full report to the Touarghee\r\nchiefs. Talking to Rais about this slaughter, his Excellency\r\nobserved, in the spirit of true Turkish policy, \"So much the better.\r\nLet the Touaricks and Shânbah slaughter one another, as long as we\r\nare left unharmed. The less of them the better for us.\" So the Turks\r\nhave always dealt with the quarrels of the Arab tribes in Barbary,\r\nrather blowing up the flames of their discord than pacifying them.\r\nThe Shânbah drove away a thousand camels, besides sheep and oxen,\r\nfrom the Touarick districts. The merchants are all frightened\r\nenough, and our departure is deferred, notwithstanding that the\r\nslave caravan met with no accident. The Shânbah have now got their\r\nbooty and revenge, and will probably decamp and leave the route\r\nclear for us. Common misfortunes often make friends of enemies. I\r\nsaw Sheikh Makouran and Mohammed Ben Mousa Ettanee, the two\r\nprincipal merchants representing the factions of Weleed and Wezeet,\r\nvery busy in conversation upon the neutral ground of the\r\nmarket-place, talking over their mutual losses. Both have lost\r\nproperty to a great amount by this Shânbah irruption.\r\n\r\n_21st._--The departure of the ghafalah is deferred to the 24th. Rais is\r\nbusy in comparing the papers of the merchants with the goods arrived from\r\nTripoli. These ill-used merchants pay 13 per cent. for exporting their\r\ngoods from Tripoli to the interior. The same goods have already paid 5\r\nper cent. when imported into Tripoli by the European merchants. There is\r\nthen the profit of our Ghadamsee merchants, and the profit of native\r\nmerchants, and the merchants and the manufacturers in Europe. At what\r\nprice, then, above their intrinsic value, are those goods sold to the\r\nmerchants of Central Africa? A hideous thing is this system of transit\r\nduties!\r\n\r\n_22nd._--Weather is cold, everybody wraps up. People sit two or three\r\nhours together out of doors in the morning before they'll stir. I ask\r\nthem, \"Why don't you move about,--you would be then warm?\" They answer,\r\n\"_Măzāl shemtz_\" (no sun yet). Rais is excessively gracious: he gave me a\r\nsmall loaf of white sugar. I had none left, and the gift came in the nick\r\nof time when required. I have said so much about Rais Mustapha, that I\r\nmust now give a personal description of his Excellency, before I take\r\nleave of him and of Ghadames. First of all, Rais is not a military man;\r\nhe is a civil servant of the Porte, and receives his pay direct from the\r\nSultan. The Turks often employ a civil servant where we should expect to\r\nsee a military man, as in this distant Saharan post, and find it to their\r\nadvantage. The Governor for military advice usually writes to the\r\nCommandant of The Mountains. His Excellency rarely reads, but writes\r\nconstantly, and is very expert in accounts, his principal occupation\r\nbeing the collecting of small monies. His Excellency is also fond of\r\ncollecting coins of different Mussulman States. The reader has seen that\r\nhe is very attentive to his religious duties, and is quite, if not\r\nsuperior \"marabout odour.\" His Excellency scarcely ever punishes anybody,\r\nbeats his slaves seldom, but can be very despotic when he pleases. Like\r\nmost Turks, he has a smack of bad faith in him, and made the Souf Arabs\r\npay the duty on the goods in their possession, though he promised people\r\nhe would not. We may suppose he is very badly off for money; perhaps his\r\nown salary is not very regularly paid. His Excellency always behaved very\r\nwell when I purchased any corn of him. He is generally esteemed by the\r\npeople. In person the Rais is exceeding tall, above a convenient height;\r\nhe is about forty years of age, with strongly-marked Turkish features,\r\nand a large aquiline nose. His limbs are heavy and large, but since his\r\nresidence here he has lost all his flesh. He dresses in the common dress\r\nof Ottoman functionaries. I often found him chatty and facetious, but\r\nsometimes he was sulky and morose, and would not speak for hours\r\ntogether. He had a fine horse, but rarely could be prevailed upon to go\r\nout and ride for his health. Every great man has his shadow, his echo,\r\nthe expression of himself more or less in his fellow men. The Rais's\r\nshadow is one Abd Errahman, a small merchant. His sons call their father\r\n_souwa-souwa_ (\"like-like\") with the Rais. Abd Errahman knew the Rais's\r\nmost secret thoughts, and he was the only Ghadamsee in whom the Rais\r\ncould entirely confide. Abd Errahman swore by the Governor's head, and\r\nwas his most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\nSheikh Makouran is occupied in purchasing me an outfit of Moorish costume\r\nfor the The Desert. He is very slow, but he gets them cheaper than if I\r\nbought them myself. He purchases one thing one day, and another thing the\r\nnext day, and all from different persons. This is the way here. Attempted\r\nmyself to purchase two turbans, one for myself and one for Said, but I\r\nfound it no easy matter. The owner asked three dollars each, alleging\r\nthat the turbans had been \"blessed at Mecca[61].\" I refused to give this\r\nprice, and it was agreed to wait till the Sheikh came. This was decided\r\nby a council of the people, against the wish of the owner, who objected\r\nto waiting. At length the Sheikh made his appearance. Nothing was said\r\nabout the price, for every one knew they must abide by the Sheikh's\r\ndecision. The Sheikh after examining the turbans, said to the seller,\r\n\"Let them be sold for one dollar each.\" The owner began to exclaim\r\nagainst this decision, but the Sheikh stopped his mouth!--\"This is our\r\nfriend (_habeebna_). Do you wish to rob him? Is this your kindness to a\r\nstranger, who has lived with us so long, and whom we all love?\" These\r\nwords were uttered with the greatest energy, and silenced every\r\nobjection. I paid the money, and a quarter of a dollar more for mine.\r\nWithout exception, the Sheikh was the most just and kindest man I met\r\nwith in Ghadames, and yet he had the reputation of being close-fisted in\r\nmoney matters. He refused to receive any rent for his house in which I\r\nlived, and when I left he ordered a quantity of cakes to be made for me,\r\nwhich he brought me himself. They were very nice, made of butter, and\r\nhoney, and dates, and lasted me all the way to Ghat. Makouran pressed the\r\nRais to write for me to the Touarick authorities of Ghat; but his\r\nExcellency could not without an order from Tripoli. I am under very great\r\nobligations to the Sheikh, who behaved like a father to me in a land of\r\nstrangers. His brother was kindness itself, but had not the spirit of the\r\nSheikh. His eldest son, Haj Besheer, was also a very kind and upright\r\nyoung man. Haj Besheer has immense influence with the Touaricks, and if\r\nhe had gone with me to Ghat, nothing would have happened. His principal\r\nconnexions are in Touat, and I really think that an European, going with\r\nletters from him to one of his Touarghee friends, might make the journey\r\nto Timbuctoo in safety. Sheikh Makouran took me to-day before the Rais\r\nand Kady, and in their presence a long \"Testimonial\" of the people of\r\nGhadames was drawn out in Arabic, stating that during the time I had\r\nresided in Ghadames I had conducted myself well, and given no offence to\r\nany one. This was signed by the Kady, on behalf of all the people, in\r\npresence of the Rais and the Nather and several other officers. I was\r\nrequested to countersign it, which I did with these words: \"I have\r\nremained three months in Ghadames, and now leave it with great personal\r\nsatisfaction to myself, and in peace with all the inhabitants.\" A copy of\r\nthis I made for the Kady to keep in Ghadames. The \"Testimonial\" itself\r\nwas sent to Colonel Warrington, through the Pasha, who either did not\r\nforward it to the Colonel, or it has been mislaid or lost, for it cannot\r\nnow be found in the Consulate Archives. The people of Ghadames were\r\ndetermined to give me this testimonial in order that the Turkish\r\nauthorities should not hereafter bring any accusation against me. It was\r\ndated the 24th, or the day fixed for departure.\r\n\r\nThe Rais astonished me to-day, by telling me, he had bastinadoed twice my\r\ntaleb, Ben Mousa, for dishonesty. I absolutely thought the Rais was\r\njoking, for the Rais and the taleb seemed always pretty good friends. I\r\nknew Ben Mousa was not extremely delicate, and would sometimes sit down\r\nwith Said and eat his dinner away from him. I inquired of the turjeman\r\nabout it, who assured me it was no joke, and that Ben Mousa had been\r\ntwice bastinadoed for borrowing things and not returning them. I was\r\nextremely sorry to hear this, for I had been greatly assisted by the\r\ntaleb in obtaining information, and we had passed many long hours\r\ntogether. The taleb is a man of about fifty, extremely clever, and a\r\npretty good scholar, and had formerly kept a school. Now he did nothing\r\nbut calculate the water distribution or irrigation of the gardens. He\r\nwished to come with me to England, to work at translations and get a\r\nlittle fortune for his family. But whenever I told him that there were\r\nvery learned Arabic scholars in England and France, he always answered,\r\n\"They are concealed Moslems;\" that is to say, afraid to confess Mahomet\r\nbefore the Christians, or seeking to convert Christians. From time to\r\ntime I gave the taleb a few presents and a little money, as also the\r\nturjeman. This latter was a very different character. He mended skin bags\r\nfor water, made shoes, white-washed houses, worked in the gardens, and\r\nmade himself generally useful. He had some property, and his garden, the\r\nheritage of his ancestors, was one of the finest in the country. He was\r\nhonest, but his defect was want of moral courage. The turjeman had lived\r\na good while in Tunis, with some French, where he learned his Italian,\r\nand a few French words. He always said, \"When I lived with the\r\nChristians, I drank wine like them.\" Some of the people, in a joke, would\r\ncall him a Christian. He was a bad scholar, and very bitter against the\r\nWahabites, whom he delighted to picture to himself in the pleasing\r\npredicament of carrying the Jews to hellfire on their backs. I myself one\r\nday had a quarrel with a Wahabite. The Wahabite called me a kafer. I\r\nretorted, \"Why, what are you? You are nothing but a Wahabite.\" He was so\r\nangry that he was about to draw his knife at me, when the people seized\r\nhold of him, and one of my friends knocked him down.\r\n\r\nRais heard of the affair, and said as he was a foreign Arab he should\r\nleave the oasis. He came afterwards to me to beg my pardon, and I gave\r\nhim some coffee to make him merry. He then told me all about the\r\nWahabites, not forgetting to abuse all the other sects. He said the Arabs\r\nof his mountain had no objection to the Turks if they would become\r\nWahabites. He was also of the Abadeeah, \"white-caps,\" and declaimed\r\nagainst the \"red\"-capped Wahabites. The controversy is as nearly as\r\npossible the same as that of our white and black-gowned clergy of the\r\nEstablished Church, introduced by the Puseyites.\r\n\r\nBegin now to have some trouble with Said. He gets sulky and saucy, and\r\nsometimes says he will stop in Ghadames and eat dates. I am obliged to\r\nbox his ears. Then he gets very frightened at the Touaricks, and begins\r\nto blubber, \"I shall be made a slave again, and you yourself will be\r\nkilled.\" Then he would complain that the Rais's servants and slaves had\r\nbetter clothes than himself. I always found it was the better way to let\r\nhim have a _sfogo_, or \"vent,\" for his temper, and afterwards he was\r\nhimself again. He never could keep a _para_ in his pocket, but would give\r\nhis money to the first person who would ask him for it. I am obliged to\r\nbuy him snuff every week, and a stock for the journey. With this he is\r\naccustomed to treat everybody, and is therefore very popular. Even the\r\nGovernor thinks him the best Negro he ever knew. As is natural enough, he\r\nis a great favourite amongst the Negresses, and even amongst the Touarick\r\nladies. I found him crying one day, and asked,--\r\n\r\n\"Said, what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I now recollect my wife whom I left in Jerba,\" he sighed out.\r\n\r\nBefore this, I didn't know he was married; he was about thirty years of\r\nage. My turjeman and Said were two great cronies, and they discussed all\r\nthe town's affairs in general, and everybody's affairs in particular. At\r\nfirst, I had not the remotest idea Said had so much wit, and was pleased\r\nto hear his remarks and criticisms. One of these was capital, and had a\r\nparticular reference to his own case. He stared at me, observing, \"We\r\ncan't put the slave-trade down whilst the Jews in Tripoli lend the\r\nmerchants here goods to carry it on.\" He was so fond of the turjeman\r\nthat, on leaving Ghadames, he gave him all the money he had, and said to\r\nme when I scolded him, \"We don't want any money in The Desert,\" adding,\r\n\"Where are the shops?\"\r\n\r\n_23rd._--Bought a camel this morning, a _nagah_, ‮ناقه‬, or\r\n\"she-camel,\" for 25 dollars. Rais would have the honour of choosing\r\nthe camel, but it was scarcely worth the money. I hired another\r\ncamel to carry a portion of the baggage. Rais told me the Pasha had\r\noffered to the Touaricks to equip an expedition, in conjunction with\r\nthem, against the Shânbah, but the Touaricks would not accept of the\r\naid, being determined to fight their own battles in their own way.\r\nThey might have thought that after the Pasha had destroyed the\r\nShânbah, he would have turned his arms against them.\r\n\r\n_24th._--We are all confusion in getting off. It is late in the\r\nafternoon. I have loaded the nagah, and disposed of my baggage; I have\r\nbid a hundred people farewell, shaking them by the hands. We are\r\nsurrounded with the whole male population of the city, and half-caste\r\nwomen. Rais is galloping about to see the people off. But a group of\r\npeople is now seen forming rapidly round a man and a boy, and a camel\r\njust come in from The Desert with a load of wood, \"What's the matter?\"\r\n\"The Shânbah! the Shânbah!\" people shout from detachment to detachment of\r\nthe ghafalah. The confusion of parting is succeeded by the terror and\r\nrushing back of the people. The advanced party abruptly returns upon the\r\nparty immediately behind it, and all rush back to the gates of the city,\r\none running over the other. Rais appears amongst them to calm the\r\nconsternation. \"What's the matter?\" His Excellency is too much agitated\r\nto answer the question. I find Sheik Makouran. \"What's the matter?\" \"The\r\nman and the boy just come in saw twenty-five Shânbah mounted on camels,\r\nand the ghafalah cannot go. Rais is going to send out a scout, a\r\n_Senawanee_, to see if it be the Shânbah, and then all the people are to\r\narm and go out against the robbers.\" A pretty kettle of fish, thought I.\r\nThe Governor then sent a man down to me, to come and sleep for the night\r\nin his house. All the merchants return, but the camels and a few men\r\nremain outside, close by the gate. A number of soldiers are sent round\r\nthe city, and the _Senawanee_ mounted on a maharee, goes off in the\r\ndirection where the Shânbah had been seen, the Rais accompanying him a\r\nshort distance. On his return, the Rais bitterly complained of the\r\nmerchants not furnishing him immediately with camels. It was some time\r\nbefore he could get the scout off. I went up a mound outside of the city\r\nto see the scout \"out of sight.\" As the white form of the maharee was\r\ndisappearing in the glare of the sand, I admired the bravery of the\r\nSenawanee, who thus defied single-handed a troop of robbers, bearding\r\nthem in their very ambush.\r\n\r\nWe waited with intense anxiety the return of the scout. Many people got\r\nupon the walls to look out. At length, at noon the 25th, a single camel\r\nwas descried on the dull red glare of the Saharan horizon. This was the\r\nSenawanee. A number of people ran to him. \"Where are the Shânbah?\"\r\n\"Where?\" \"Shânbah?\" The messenger said nothing--he was dumb. A crowd\r\ngets round him--he's still dumb. He enters the Rais's hall of conference,\r\nand squats down in the presence of his Excellency. He speaks now, and\r\ncalls for coffee. The Rais gets furiously agitated at the moment of\r\nbreaking silence. The scout very calmly sips off his coffee, and strokes\r\ndown his beard, and then deigned to satisfy Governor, Kady, officers, and\r\nthe men, women, and children, who were now pressing upon him with\r\ndreadful agitation. \"Oh, Bey! (raising himself from the floor, fixing his\r\neyes now on the Bey, and now on the people, and putting his fore-finger\r\nof the right hand on the thumb of the left)--I went to the sand. I got\r\nthere when the sun was gone down. The camel lay down, and so did I lay\r\ndown on the sand. We watched all night. I fear no one but God!--(Here was\r\na general hum of approbation.)--Two hours before the _fidger_, (break of\r\nday) I looked up and saw pass by me, at a distance of from here to The\r\nSpring, nine _Bughar_ (wild-bullocks). They came and went, and went and\r\ncame, snuffing up the sand and bellowing. The man and the boy, who cut\r\nthe wood yesterday, saw the _Bughar_. But the wild oxen are not the\r\nShânbah!\" As soon as he mentioned the _Bughar_, the people rushing out of\r\nthe Bey's apartment, ran away, and before I could get my dinner, a\r\nportion of the ghafalah was on the move. The Rais said to me, \"Get off,\r\nmake haste--make haste.\" I then went down to load the nagah again, but\r\nfound it very difficult; seeing the other camels passing on, she would\r\nnot stop to be laden. At length my turjeman came and arranged all. Said\r\nobserved that the obstinacy of the nagah was a bad omen. His Excellency\r\nthe Governor came to see me off, and gave me an affectionate shake of the\r\nhands. I then met his confidential man Abd-Errahman, who said to me,\r\n\"Rais has given you in charge of all the people of the ghafalah, (about\r\nsixty persons\"). This was kind of the Governor, and better, perhaps, than\r\nbeing in the charge of one individual. But still I couldn't help\r\nthinking, that what is many persons' business is nobody's business. The\r\nturjeman accompanied us some distance, chatting with Said. He carried\r\nwith him a quantity of date-tree fibrous netting, and was twisting bands\r\nas he followed us. We soon parted. I then passed my old friend the\r\ngood-natured Arab doctor. His parting blessing spoke the native goodness\r\nof his heart: \"Day cool, route wide, route Fezzan, ghafalah large,\r\nShânbah there are none--God bless you, farewell!\"\r\n\r\nI began to breathe at once the free air of the open Desert. As is my\r\nwont, I now committed my spirit to the care of God Almighty, leaving my\r\nbody to the care of the wild tribes of these inhospitable wastes. And why\r\nnot? Why distrust them? Have not the people hitherto treated me with\r\ngreat and unexpected kindness? And is it not the first step to make\r\nstrangers your enemies, to distrust them?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[58] They call all other languages in the world _Ajem_--‮عجم‬--a\r\n    distinction like that of Jew and Gentile, only applied to language\r\n    instead of persons.\r\n\r\n[59] Sale says:--\"Mahomet here and elsewhere frequently imitates\r\n    the truly inspired writers, in making God to operate on the minds\r\n    of reprobates, to prevent their conversion.\" Impostors in all ages\r\n    have charged the inefficacy of their novel mysteries upon the will\r\n    of God. But these passages have had their use and humanity effects\r\n    in the strife of contending religions. A Mahometan bigot, with\r\n    sword in one hand and victim in the other, has often spared his\r\n    life and his conversion by recollecting, \"_God had sealed up his\r\n    heart and his hearing_,\" so that he could not believe.

I see in them the mixture of the religious and commercial\r\ncharacter, blended in a most extraordinary manner and degree, for here\r\nthe possession of wealth scarcely interferes with the highest state of\r\nascetic devotion. To a religious scrupulousness, which is alarmed at a\r\ndrop of medicine that is prohibited falling upon their clothes, they add\r\nthe most enterprising and determined spirit of commercial enterprise,\r\nplunging into The Desert, often in companies of only two or three, when\r\ninfested with bandits and cut-throats, their journies the meanwhile\r\nextending from the shores of the Mediterranean to the banks of the Niger,\r\nas low down to the Western Coast as Noufee and Rabbah. But their\r\nresignation to the will of heaven is without a parallel. No murmur\r\nescapes them under the severest domestic affliction; whilst prayer is\r\ntheir daily bread. Besides five times a day, they never omit the\r\nextraordinary occasions. The aspirations of the older and retired men\r\ncontinue all the live-long day; this incense of the soul, rising before\r\nthe altar of the Eternal, is a fire which is never extinguished in\r\nGhadames! Their commercial habits naturally beget caution, if not fear.\r\nIn The Desert, though armed, they have no courage to fight. Their arms\r\nare their mysterious playthings. Their genius is pacific and to make\r\npeace--they are the peacemakers of The Desert--and they always travel\r\nunder the intrepid escort of their warlike Touarick friends and\r\nneighbours. Intelligent, instructed and industrious, they are the\r\ngreatest friends of civilization in North Africa and the Great Desert.\r\nBut upon such a people, falls as a blast of lightning, rending and\r\nshivering the fairest palm of the oasis, the curse of Turkish rule.\r\n\r\nThe force of our caravan consists of about eighty people, including\r\nstrangers, and two hundred laden camels. Nearly all the people are armed,\r\nand some single individuals have two or three matchlocks, besides pistols\r\nand daggers. The character of the people are petty traders, commission\r\nagents, camel-drivers, and slaves. There are several Arabs, natives of\r\nGhadames, Seenawan, and Derge, and five strangers from Souf. We have with\r\nus also three Touaricks. There may be half-a-dozen low women and female\r\nslaves distributed amongst the ghafalah. Respectable females scarcely\r\never travel in The Desert. I have only with me my negro servant Said. My\r\nlarge trunk and tent are conveyed by another camel; the nagah carries me,\r\nthe provisions, and the rest of the baggage, going extremely well. Said\r\nwalks with the servants, slaves, and camel-drivers. Two-thirds of the\r\npeople are on foot. Started in tolerably good health and spirits, and\r\nincrease my appetite every mile I ride. Feel no fatigue, of course,\r\nto-day, and trust I shall soon forget I'm travelling in The Sahara. There\r\nare many routes from Ghadames to Ghat, no less than four or five\r\nwell-travelled desert tracts. Our present one is the more easterly, being\r\nskirted by the oasisian districts of Fezzan. None of these routes have\r\nbeen travelled before by an European. Our course to-day is directly east.\r\nWe are now encamping at sun-set, and we have just lost sight of the palms\r\nof Ghadames. Alas! this will, I fear, be an everlasting farewell to the\r\nbeautiful oasis, and the holy city of merchants.\r\n\r\n_26th._--Rose before sunrise. Morning cool and refreshing. We are to\r\ncontinue ten days in the route of Fezzan, then turn into that of Ghat,\r\nthus describing a sort of semicircle to get out of the forays of the\r\nShânbah.\r\n\r\nCourse south-east. On the right ranges of low dull hills, with the same\r\non the left, but at a greater distance. The road very good, fit for\r\ncarriages, through the broad bed of a valley. Two great blocks of rock\r\nstand out on the surface which we traverse, one an oblong square, the\r\nother sugar-loaf, but flattened at the top.\r\n\r\n_Camel-drivers._--\"Look at these brothers\" (the two rocks.)\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"How! Are these brothers? They are not much like.\"\r\n\r\n_Camel-drivers._--\"Yâkob, don't you know that one brother is born like\r\nthe father, and the other like the mother?\"\r\n\r\nThese huge blocks we had long in view, and approached and passed them\r\njust as a ship passes rocks on the sea-coast. So steady is our progress,\r\nso level our route. Ground strewn over with small flints and other sharp\r\nchips of stone. Saw nothing alive in The Desert but one solitary bird,\r\nwhich seemed lost in the illimitable waste. Passed the grave of one who\r\nhad died in open desert, a small tumulus of stones marked the sad spot;\r\npassed also a few white-bleached camel's bones. Very cold, wind from\r\nnorth-east. Feel it more than the keenest winter's blast of Old England.\r\nFeel glad I took the advice of the Governor of Ghadames, and purchased a\r\nquantity of warm woollen clothing, heik, bornouse, and jibbah. \"That\r\nroute (Ghat) kills people with the cold,\" his Excellency observed.\r\n\r\n_27th._--Arrived at the well of Maseen, at 4 P.M. Much the same scenery\r\nas yesterday. The road good, not quite so stony as yesterday, and\r\nscattered over with pieces of very fine quartz and shining felspar. No\r\nsand in quantity, and a little herbage for camels. Wind as yesterday, but\r\nmore of it. Maseen is a tolerably deep well, but the water is not very\r\nsweet. About it there are three or four stunted date-palms, and several\r\nshrubby sprouts, pointing the Saharan wayfarer to the well's site. One\r\nof the trees bore fruit this year, but the palm rarely bears fruit in\r\nopen desert. No bird or animal of any sort seen to-day. The camels crop\r\nherbage _en route_ as usual. On the whole, however, we proceed pretty\r\nquickly. I imagine about three miles the hour, for a man must walk a\r\nsharp pace to keep up well with the camels. Our people eat nothing in the\r\nmorning; two or three, perhaps, may eat a cake and a few dates. They\r\nliterally fast all day long and take their _one_ meal at about seven in\r\nthe evening. I can't support this, and take tea in the morning, besides\r\nmunching dates at intervals through the day. Nay, I feel ravenous, under\r\nthe influence of the bleak air of The Desert. About an hour before\r\nsunrise all the people get up and make large fires, warming their feet\r\nand legs, for these are mostly bare and are very sensible to the cold.\r\nI'm sorry I've been obliged to scold Said twice, once for running away\r\nfrom my camel after other people's, and once for rough and saucy\r\nlanguage. But I must make the best of him; might easily get a worse\r\nservant. Glad the eldest son of the Sheikh Makouran has joined the\r\ncaravan; he came riding after us this evening, attended with a Touarick,\r\nboth mounted on maharees, well equipped and capable of scouring The\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\n_28th._--Some time before we got off this morning, on account of the\r\ndifficulty of watering the camels. My nagah started off on the route\r\nof Fezzan about a mile and a half, and Said went another way in\r\nsearch of her. I was, therefore, obliged to fetch her myself, which\r\nwas a considerable run through a hilly region. I found her alone\r\nwandering about. The she-camel strays more than the male-camel, and\r\nis more restless. As soon as I called to her she stopped, stood\r\nstock-still, and looked at me. Before the camels were all watered,\r\nthe well of Mazeen was nearly dry and the water muddy. This is the\r\nreason large caravans have such difficulty in traversing The Desert,\r\nit often requiring several days to water a thousand camels. Here I\r\nrecollected the justness of Napoleon's observation cited by French\r\nwriters,--\"That if Africa is to be invaded and conquered _viâ_ The\r\nGreat Desert, it must be done by small detached parties.\" For it is\r\nnot that the wells do not afford a sufficiency of water for large\r\ncaravans, but that they do not yield an immediate supply for\r\nnumerous bodies, so as to enable their people to march in one\r\ncompact whole. Here we were obliged to leave half the caravan,\r\nwaiting for the running of the water, thus miserably dividing our\r\nstrength in case of attack. Noticed one of the camels laden with a\r\nbale of goods, on which were European writing, viz., I. A. N. 6. The\r\ngreat merchants usually write the name of their firm under the\r\ndesignation of _Oulad_ (‮اولاد‬) \"sons,\" for example, _Oulad\r\nMakouran_, \"Sons of Makouran.\"\r\n\r\nThe advanced party, of which I was, unexpectedly left the route of\r\nFezzan to the east, and turned sharp round to the south, through the\r\ngorge of a low mountain range, which we had had all along to the\r\nright. In this defile we proceeded an hour, but it had no natural\r\nopening at the end. We came at last to a very abrupt ascent of some\r\nhundred feet high, and mounted an elevated plateau. Once on the\r\nplateau, all was plain as far as the eye could see. The defile was\r\ntertiary formation, mere dull crumbling limestone; nothing in the\r\nshape and consistence of granite. We are now on the highway for\r\nGhat, and it is said we shall arrive in fifteen days from the\r\nplateau. Saw on the plateau, for the first time of my life, the\r\ncelebrated mirage, which our people call _Watta_, but the classic\r\nArabic is _Es-Sarab_ (‮السّرب‬). At first sight, I thought it was\r\nsalt, for it flamed in the sun white, like a salt-pit, or lagoon.\r\nThere appeared some low hills in the midst of the white lake. As we\r\nproceeded, I saw what appeared like white foam running from east to\r\nwest, as the sea-surf chafing the shore. It then occurred to me that\r\nthis might be the mirage; and so it turned out, for as we approached\r\nthe phenomenon, it retired and disappeared. The character of the\r\nmirage was evidently affected by the wind, for the foam appeared to\r\nrun from east to west with the wind. In some of the white flaming\r\nlakes, shrubs and reeds stood out, as we find in shallow pools. Some\r\nhigh hills appeared suspended in the air, veritable \"castles in the\r\nair.\" The weather was dull, the sun sometimes hidden, and it was\r\nnoon when the phenomena were most observable. At Mazeen a few small\r\nbirds were hopping and chirping, and two large crows followed us\r\nupon the plateau; also a butterfly and a few flies. These are the\r\nliving creatures noticed to-day.\r\n\r\nThe plateau, where I now write, is either covered with very small stones,\r\nsome quite black, and others calcined or burnt, like brick-bats thrown\r\nfrom a kiln, or is altogether hardened and black earthy soil. The latter\r\nassists the mirage, for the phenomenon appears mostly on the earthy\r\ntracts of ground. In some parts is herbage for the camels. On the plateau\r\nwe saw several small mounds of soft brown stone, crumbling to earth,\r\nwhich looked like Arab hovels at a distance. I went up to undeceive\r\nmyself. These curious mounds have yet to crumble away before the plateau\r\nis a perfect plane. Course to-day mostly south, with a leaning to the\r\nwest. Wind cold S.E. and E. The day as dull and dreary as in England. Our\r\npeople occasionally mount the maharees, which look very haughty and\r\nimposing. A maharee would be a noble present for the Sultan of the\r\nTouaricks to send to the Queen.\r\n\r\nWas surprised this morning at a question, as \"To whom Tripoli belonged?\"\r\nto the English or the Sultan (of Constantinople). I find there is a vague\r\nnotion amongst our ghafalah that Tripoli is either really the property of\r\nthe English, or under the immediate protection of England. \"Just the\r\nsame,\" say the people. They prefer the late tyrant Bashaw, Asker Ali, to\r\nthe present Mehemet, because Asker Ali, they say, did not fleece them so\r\nmuch or so plunder them of their money. 'Tis natural enough. One of the\r\nlower fellows had the impudence to say, \"The English Consul receives\r\nbribes from Mehemet Pasha to let him remain in Tripoli.\" These people are\r\ngreat gobemouches; they always report the most incredible things. A\r\ntrader said to me, \"When you get to Soudan you must marry two wives; this\r\nis our custom.\" I replied, \"I never do anything out of my country, and\r\napart from my countrymen, which I should be ashamed to do at home in\r\ntheir presence.\" Some of these Desert louts are very familiar and\r\ninsolent, and require sharp answers to keep them at a distance. I must\r\nnot forget to mention, the Rais put my passport _en règle_ for Soudan. A\r\nmore monstrous piece of absurdity could not be attempted against the\r\nvirtue of the free and simple-minded children of The Desert. Such\r\ndocuments are only fit for our elevated Christian civilization, for\r\ncountries like Naples, France, and Austria, the hot-beds of spies and\r\npolice. When I showed my passport to the Touaricks, and explained to them\r\nwhat it was for, they very indignantly (and properly so) spat on it.\r\n\r\n_29th._--Not a living creature was met with to-day. Our camels found the\r\n\"dry bones\" of camels perished in The Desert; they munched them with\r\ngusto, a piece of cannibalism on the part of these melancholy creatures\r\nwhich I was not prepared for. Dr. Oudney remarks, \"The latter (camels)\r\nare very fond of chewing dried bones.\" In some parts of the routes,\r\nmostly where the water-stations are distant, and where they drop from\r\nexhaustion before reaching the wells, camels' bones lie in such heaps as\r\nto suggest, the Vision of the Dry Bones of Ezekiel.\r\n\r\nWe started with the rising sun and continued till four o'clock P.M.\r\nA strong S. and S.E. wind blew all day, and very cold, parching my\r\nlips and mouth. This wind would have a veritable burning simoon in\r\nthe summer! We traversed all day the plateau, now become an\r\nimmeasurable plain. It slightly undulates in parts, but I think we\r\ncontinued to ascend. Some of the surface is wholly naked, having\r\nneither herbage or stones scattered about, being of a softish clayey\r\nsoil, and printed in little diamond squares, like the dry bottom of\r\na small lake on the sea-shore. This, I doubt not, is the action of\r\nthe rain, which falls at long intervals. Other parts presented the\r\nusual black calcined stones, and sometimes pieces of the common\r\nlimestone and pebbles, but not very round. The track was in some\r\nplaces well-defined, in others the earth so hard as not to admit of\r\nthe impression of the camel's foot. Passed by several tumuli of\r\nstones, said by the people to mark the route, and called\r\n_âlam_--‮علم‬--directors. Passed also a conspicuous tomb of some\r\ndistinguished individual, who had died in the open Desert. There was\r\nno writing or ornament, only a higher heap of stones, and piled in\r\nthe shape of an oblong square. As soon as a traveller dies he is\r\nburied, if he have companions; the body is never brought to the\r\nneighbouring oases. My friend Haj-el-Besheer, to my regret, has\r\ndisappeared with the Touarick.\r\n\r\nNothing possibly could be more horrible and dreary, exhibiting the very\r\n\"palpable obscure,\" than our course of to-day. As far as the eye can\r\nstretch on every side is one vast, solitary, lifeless, treeless expanse\r\nof desert earth! It is a--\r\n\r\n        \"Dreary [plain] forlorn and wild,\r\n    The seat of desolation.\"\r\n\r\nA Derge Arab said to me this evening, \"The English will never come to\r\nDerge, wherever else they may go. The climate will kill them; in three\r\ndays you will die of fever.\" The love of discussion, as well as their\r\ncomplaints against the Turkish Government, follow our people through The\r\nDesert. They are trying to make me turn Mohammedan, as far as disputing\r\ngoes, and I have enough to do to get rid of their importunities.\r\nSometimes I get the conversation turned by telling them, if I turn\r\nMussulman I shall offend my Sultan. They reply, \"Oh! you can confess with\r\nyour lips, that you are a Christian, whilst you remain a Mussulman in\r\nyour heart.\" One fellow got saucy, and said, turning up the fire with a\r\nstick, \"The Jews and Christians will have this (fire) for ever.\"\r\nThreatening to report him to the Rais of Ghadames, he exclaimed, \"The dog\r\nRais has no rule in The Sahara.\" The other people made him hold his\r\ntongue. Felt the cold last night but especially this morning. It nips me\r\nup severely. Sleep in the clothes I wear during the day, and have\r\nadditional covering of a thick rug and a cloak. We pitch no tents. Very\r\nlittle water is now drunk. Our people seem to shun it as mad dogs. As to\r\nthe morning, no one drinks water this time of the day. How different to\r\nthe summer! when a drink of water is sometimes reckoned a great favour,\r\nan immense boon, a heaven's best gift.\r\n\r\n_30th._--A fine morning; the dawn almost cloudless. Not so\r\nyesterday, volumes of cloud on cloud inflamed with purple stretched\r\nover all the east, not unlike an English summer's dawn, but the\r\ncolours more vivid. But this was succeeded by the dreariest of days.\r\nIn summer, the Saharan dawn is usually cloudless, and offers no\r\nbeautiful variety of colours. The cloud of yesterday was surcharged\r\nwith wind, which we soon felt to our annoyance. In The Desert the\r\nwind generally rises in the morning and falls in the evening. We\r\ncontinued our course over the vast plain all the morning, but at\r\nmidday it broke into wide shallow valleys, and in the evening it was cut\r\nacross by a large broad valley, or wady, as the Moors called it, stretching\r\neast and west. In this wady lies the well of _Năthār_ or _Năjār_,\r\nsome spelling the name with the ‮ز‬--‮النزار‬. Here we\r\nencamp. We had come a very long weary day. Begin to feel very\r\nsensibly the hardships of Desert travelling. The length of a day's\r\njourney depends upon whether water is near or far off, and also upon\r\nthere being fodder for camels. Our Arabs are obliged to look out\r\nlest they encamp upon an arid spot where the poor camel cannot crop\r\na single herb. Mostly in the beds--dry beds of these wadys--there is\r\nsome herbage and brushwood. The well of Nathar is very deep, and cut\r\nthrough rock as well as earth, but its water is extremely sweet and\r\ndelicious. We usually find the best water running through rocky\r\nsoil. _En route_, I observed no living creature, save a grasshopper,\r\nwhich had managed to get into existence amidst these herbless wilds.\r\nThink I also saw an ant near the foot of the camel. A few flies\r\nstill follow our caravan, which we brought from Ghadames. These\r\nwitless things have wisdom enough not to remain behind and perish in\r\nThe Desert. Passed by two dead camels, fast decomposing into bones.\r\nRoad all small stones sprinkled over an earthy soil, or altogether\r\nearth. Mirage again seen, with similar phenomena. Small islets in\r\nthe midst of lakes, and white foam running on the ground as on the\r\nsea-shore. Our course S. and S.E.\r\n\r\n_1st December._--A fine mild morning, but intensely cold during the past\r\nnight. Here we took fresh water enough for four days, the time required\r\nto arrive at the next well. Started about 11 A.M., and continued only\r\nthree hours and a half, when we came to another wady, where we stopped in\r\norder to let the camels have their fill of the rich fodder with which the\r\nwady is covered. The plateau is now apparently disappearing, for it is\r\nbroken into deep and broad valleys, from the sides of which rise in\r\ngroups, and at various distances, low ranges of Saharan hills, and on one\r\nside, is a range very high, having very wild mountainous features. We\r\nhave now travelled nearly six days, and have not yet met with fifty yards\r\nof sandy route. So much for the sandy Desert! All is either earth,\r\nsometimes as hard-baked as stone, or large blocks of stone, but chiefly\r\nvery small chips of stone covering the entire surface. Our Arabs ask me,\r\n\"Whether I prefer travelling by land or sea?\" They imagine Christians,\r\nwhen they travel, necessarily travel by sea. They are also greatly\r\nastonished when I tell them we have no Sahara in England, and cannot\r\ncredit the idea of a country being full of cultivated fields and gardens.\r\nThe rest of our ghafalah, consisting of more than a third, is not yet\r\ncome up, but Haj-el-Besheer and the Touarick Ali have joined us again and\r\nreport them to be at the well of Nather.\r\n\r\nTwo or three birds were seen this morning about the wells. They were\r\nexcessively familiar, and knew instinctively how to estimate the sight of\r\na caravan for the crumbs and grains it might leave behind. They seemed\r\nalso quite at home at the well. Still one would think they were birds of\r\npassage, like ourselves, for there are no trees or bushes for them to\r\nbuild in, and little to eat. Saw also a single lizard. I believe lizards\r\nabound in every part of The Sahara, but the cold now keeps them in their\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nThree or four of our party have left us, mounted on maharees, for Ghat.\r\nThey say they shall arrive in six or seven days. They will soon see if\r\nbanditti are before us, and will return to let us know. Thought I should\r\nescape the orthodox _body_-guard. But it seems not. Where every person is\r\nobliged to accept of this guard, _bon gré, malgré_, it seems I must\r\nsubmit. However, I shall do without their services if possible. I\r\noffended a Moor by telling him that Christians do not require it, and\r\nhave not this guard: it is only \"peculiar to Mussulmans.\" A necessary\r\npart of the occupation of a ghafalah when it reaches a well is collecting\r\nand cracking the vermin. The camels are terrible things for straying. If\r\nthey are surrounded with immense patches of the most choice herbage, even\r\nwhich is their delicium, they still keep on straying the more over it\r\nmiles and miles. As to our nagah, we are obliged to tie her fore-feet,\r\nwhich prevents the camel from getting at a very great distance from the\r\nencampment. The camels are sly, unimpassioned, and deliberately savage,\r\none to another, more especially the males. At times they go steadily, and\r\neven slowly, behind one another, and turning the neck and head sideways,\r\ndeliberately bite one another's haunches most ferociously. The drivers\r\nimmediately separate them, for the bite is dangerous to their health, and\r\noften attended with serious mischief to the animal bitten. But I have\r\nnever yet seen a camel kick or attack a man. They invariably grumble and\r\ngrowl, sometimes most piteously, when they are being loaded, as if\r\ndeprecating the heavy burden about to be placed upon them, and appealing\r\nto the mercy of their masters. The merchants pay 13½ Tunisian piastres\r\nper cantar for goods now conveyed from Ghadames to Ghat. The Touaricks\r\ncarry goods cheaper, but they are now gone after the Shânbah. The Arabs\r\nasked 25, but the Rais of Ghadames fixed it at 13½. A camel carries from\r\n2 to 3½ cantars[62]. I confess I was sorry to see these apparently so\r\nquiet and melancholy creatures ferocious to one another; but I\r\nrecollected that all animals, even doves, quarrel and fight, and\r\nparticularly males, where females are concerned.\r\n\r\nTo-day took out of my trunk Mr. Fletcher's note to me, to read over,\r\nwhich I had received from Malta during the time of my being in The\r\nDesert. The advice to travellers which it contains in a very few words,\r\nis so good, so excellent, that I shall take the liberty of transcribing\r\nit here, for the benefit of all future tourists in The Desert.\r\n\r\n1st. \"Keep a sharp look out about you, and pick up information.\"\r\n\r\n2nd. \"Keep with Sheiks, Religionists, (he means I suppose, Marabouts,)\r\nand Chieftains, for these are the only people who can give you\r\nprotection.\"\r\n\r\n3rd. \"Expose yourself to no unnecessary risks and dangers.\"\r\n\r\n4th. \"Conciliate!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Fletcher adds, \"The white man is at the mercy of every tenant of The\r\nDesert, and though we would, one cannot be all things to all men.\"\r\nNevertheless, I do think, _poverty_ is my great protection in travelling\r\nin these countries. My fellow-travellers, up to the present time, are\r\ncivil and assist me. It is necessary to mention here, I have neither\r\ncompass nor thermometer, nor measure of any kind, nor maps, nor watch, so\r\nthat I'm afraid my journal will sound ill to scientific ears. This was\r\nvery bad management. Still we shall see what a man can do without the\r\nordinary and most common scientific instruments of travelling. I have,\r\nhowever, an hour-glass, which embraces four hours in the time of\r\nemptying, and which I found useful in Ghadames, but make no use of it _en\r\nroute_. I consider the objects of my tour _moral_, a random effort to\r\nmaim, or kill, or cripple the Monster Slavery, a small rough stone picked\r\nup casually from the burnt and arid face of The Desert, but with\r\ndauntless hand thrown at this Titanian fabric of crime and wickedness.\r\nHowever, as my friend Mr. Fletcher advises, it does not prevent me from\r\n\"picking up information,\" any how and everywhere, which I trust the\r\nreader will have already perceived. As a person who loses one sense\r\nacquires more intensity in others, so I, having no artificial means for\r\nprocuring information with me, must do all by the ordinary senses of\r\nobservation, common to the civilized man and the savage.\r\n\r\nThe mirage was very abundant to-day, producing a variety of splendid\r\nphenomena, \"_Castelli in Spagna_,\" running streams, and silvery lakes,\r\nand a thousand things of water, and air, and landscape, just types of\r\nthose pleasures and delights which we seek, and when grasping them, they\r\nslip from between our fingers.\r\n\r\nWhilst we were encamped, two hours before sun-set, we were suddenly\r\nalarmed by the cries of banditti and Shânbah, and all were called upon to\r\narm. At the same time people were sent off to bring up the camels which\r\nwere grazing and straying at a distance. I was amusing myself with\r\ncooking the supper, and started up, not knowing what to make of it; I\r\ncouldn't however help laughing at the queer predicament in which the\r\nsupper looked, and thought I had been making it for the Shânbah. Running\r\nforward to see the cause of the alarm, I saw in the south, dimly at a\r\ndistance, a small caravan approaching us. There were three or four\r\ncamels, and several persons on foot. I then thought I must look about\r\nfor a weapon of some sort. A man gave me a huge horse-pistol, and with\r\nthis I sallied forth to take part in the common defence. Seeing an Arab\r\nfar in advance, and alone, I went after him, who turned out to be one of\r\nthe Souafah, whose acquaintance I had already made. This Arab certainly\r\nshowed considerable bravery, and took up a reconnoitring position on a\r\nrising ground, looking with a steady and determined eye upon the\r\napproaching caravan. He turned to me and said bluffly, \"It must be a\r\nTouarick ghafalah.\" Meanwhile, about forty people all armed, assembled\r\n_pêle-mêle_ on the opposite side of the route, on a hill behind, uttering\r\nwild cries, and throwing up their matchlocks into the air. The cries now\r\nceased, and was succeeded by a most anxious silence, all waiting a closer\r\nobservation. At length, the experienced eye of our people discovered what\r\nwas considered a troop of bandits on foot, to be a caravan of slaves. And\r\nimmediately a number of the people ran off violently to meet the\r\nslave-caravan, which was escorted by our own Touaricks, the slaves being\r\nthe property of our people. Our surprise was the greater when we found\r\nHaj-el-Besheer, and his companion the Touarick, returning with the\r\ncaravan, which had brought letters for all the people. So the bandits\r\nturned out to be our friends and neighbours; and so burst this bubble of\r\nalarm. I observed two persons with long staffs lagging behind, and\r\nimagined them old men labouring along the route. What was my astonishment\r\nto find, as they approached, these old men gradually transformed into\r\npoor little children--child-slaves--crawling over the ground, scarcely\r\nable to move. Oh, what a curse is slavery! how full of hard-heartedness\r\nand cruelty! As soon as the poor slaves arrived, they set to work and\r\nmade a fire. Some of them were laden with wood when they came up. The\r\nfire was their only protection from the cold, the raw bitter cold of the\r\nnight, for they were nearly naked. I require as much as three ordinary\r\ngreat coats, besides the usual clothing of the day, to keep me warm in\r\nthe night; these poor things, the chilly children of the tropics, have\r\nonly a rag to cover them, and a bit of fire to warm them. I shall never\r\nforget the sparkling eyes of delight of one of the poor little boys, as\r\nhe sat down and looked into the crackling glaring fire of desert scrub.\r\nIn the evening I noticed the amount of the food which was given as the\r\none daily meal to these famished creatures, ten in number. Said usually\r\neats more than the whole of it for his supper. The food was barley-meal\r\nmixed with water. The slaves were children and youths, all males. They\r\nhad been already fourteen days _en route_ from Ghat, and would be eight\r\nmore before they could reach Ghadames. By that time, like the last slaves\r\nwhich arrived whilst I was there, they would be simply \"living\r\nskeletons.\" The misery is, these slaves are conducted not by their\r\nmasters, but slave-drivers, at so much per head, and consequently the\r\nconductors feed the slaves on as little as possible, to make the most of\r\ntheir bargain with the owners. The slave-caravan, however, brought us\r\ngood news.\r\n\r\nThe Shânbah, after ravaging the Touarick districts, had fled their own\r\ncountry, and taken refuge in the Algerian territory--so escaping the\r\nvengeance of the Touaricks. We have, therefore, no enemy _en route_,\r\nthank God, except ourselves, and our own quarrels, which occur but\r\nseldom. The annual winter Soudan caravan had not yet arrived in Ghat, but\r\nwas expected every day. It is worth mentioning here, as a remarkable\r\ntrait of good faith amongst the Moors and Arabs, that they do not often\r\nseal their letters, but fold them up as we do notes of trifling import.\r\nAll the letters brought to-day were unsealed, and did not require\r\n_Grahamizing_. Haj-el-Besheer told me it was _haram_ (\"prohibited,\") for\r\nstrangers to read these unsealed letters. My readers will see that we are\r\nagain obliged to go to the barbarians of The Desert to learn the ordinary\r\npractices of good faith and morality. How exceedingly rejoiced would be\r\nthe \"_Haute Police_\" of _civilized_ Europe to have all letters sent\r\n_un_-sealed through the Post Office! What a pity these Mahometan\r\nbarbarians are so trusting and simple-minded! What a pity our boasted\r\nreligion does not teach us Christians the honesty of barbarians! We wrote\r\nletters to Ghadames and Tripoli over the fire-light. Afterwards my friend\r\nHaj-el-Besheer commenced a sing-song repetition of a Marabout legend,\r\nwhich he continued all the evening, speaking to no one; even whilst he\r\nwas eating he continued his rigmarole story to himself, the people taking\r\nno notice of him. I was greatly amused at this odd singing to one's self.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--A very fine morning, and, as I anticipated, it turned out very\r\nhot. Yet whilst the sun scorched my face on one side, the cold wind from\r\nthe east blanched my cheek on the other. No living creature seen but a\r\nfew insects. Our people fell in with the skeleton of a Touarick ass, and\r\namused themselves with setting it up upon its legs, as if in the pillory.\r\nI rallied them afterwards as they were in a good humour, on their terror\r\nof banditti yesterday. They replied, \"It was the number of people on\r\nfoot which alarmed us, banditti generally go on foot with a few camels to\r\ncarry provisions and water.\" We started at sun-rise and encamped an hour\r\nbefore sun-set, to have light enough to collect firewood, and forage for\r\nthe camels. The ground of our course to-day was broken into broad and\r\nlong valleys. In the wady where we encamp is herbage for camels. I notice\r\nas a thing most extraordinary, after seven days from Ghadames, two small\r\ntrees! the common Desert acacia. Another phenomenon, I see two or three\r\npretty blue flowers! as I picked one up, I could not help exclaiming,\r\n_Elhamdullah_, (\"Praise to God!\") for Arabic was growing second-born to\r\nmy tongue, and I began to think in it. An Arab said to me, \"Yâkob, if we\r\nhad a reed and were to make a melodious sound, those flowers, the colour\r\nof heaven, would open and shut their mouths (petals).\" This fiction is\r\nextremely poetical. Felt unwell this morning from eating or munching too\r\nmany dates; better this evening. All our people well, and no accidents.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--Rose at sun-rise and pursued our weary way over broken ground,\r\nnow broad valleys, now low hills. Whilst exclaiming that the sandy desert\r\nwas all \"a report,\" \"a talk,\" \"a fabrication of travellers who wished to\r\nincrease and vary the catalogue of Saharan hardships,\" at noon we came\r\nupon a range of sand-hills. These increased on every side, and at length\r\nwe cut right across a group of them. Having left the plateau the mirage\r\nhas also disappeared, apparently the only species of desert where it can\r\nbe fairly developed. With the sand has appeared a new kind of stone, of a\r\nlight-blue slate colour, some of it of as firm a consistence as granite.\r\nIts colour also sometimes varies to a beautiful light green. The Desert\r\nitself only increases and varies in hideousness. And yet in some places\r\nwhere sand is sprinkled over the hardened earth, a little coarse herbage\r\nsprings up. Encamped at night. Cold all day. Felt unwell. To-day and\r\nyesterday course mostly south.\r\n\r\n_4th._--Sand-hills increase in number, and find ourselves in the heart of\r\na region of sand. At noon descended the deepest wady we have yet\r\nencountered. On the big blocks of rock below Arabic and Touarghee letters\r\nwere carved. The barbarians, as their civilized brethren, seek in this\r\nway also a bastard immortality for their names. Down in the valley we\r\npassed some human bones; the skull was perfect. Who shall write the\r\nhistory of these bones? Are they those of one who was murdered, or who\r\ndropped from exhaustion in The Desert? These bones scattered at the\r\ncamel's feet made the march of to-day still more melancholy. No herbage\r\nfor camels or wood for fire. Gave our nagah barley and dates. It\r\nfrequently happens, there is no wood _en route_ (I mean underwood or\r\nscrub), or at the place where we are obliged to stop. This obliges us to\r\ncarry it from places where it abounds, as also a little herbage for the\r\ncamels. Pitched our camp amidst the sandy waste late at night. Our route\r\nvaried between S.W., S., and S.E., but around some huge groups of\r\nsand-hills we were obliged to make a painful circuit. Warmer to-day, and\r\na little wind, always from the east. No living creature met with! No\r\nsound or voice heard! Felt better to-day.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Rose with the sun, as it enflamed the sand-hills, and made them\r\nlike burnished heaps of metal. Marched three hours amidst the\r\nsand-hills. Very difficult route for the camels, which frequently upset\r\ntheir loads in mounting or descending the groups of hills. The Arabs\r\nsmooth the abrupt ascents, forming an inclined plane of sand, and then,\r\nin the descents, pull back the camels, swinging with all their might on\r\nthe tails of the animals. No herbage--no stone--no earthy ground--all,\r\neverything one wide waste of sand, shining under the fervid sun as bright\r\nas the light, dazzling and blinding the eyes. But Milton's poetic eye,\r\nturning, or in \"a fine frenzy rolling\" to the ends of the earth,\r\nsubjecting all the images and wonders of nature, of all climates and\r\ncountries, to the supporting of his majestic verse, glanced also at these\r\nsands of the Lybian Desert--\r\n\r\n        \"Unnumbered as the sands\r\n    Of Barca or Cyrene's torrid soil.\"\r\n\r\nEl-Aïshi, describing the sandy Sahara, says, \"There is neither tree, nor\r\nbush, nor herb. The eye sees only clouds of sand, raised by continual\r\nwinds, which by their violence efface the marks of the caravan as fast as\r\nmen and animals imprint them with their feet. The aspect of this\r\nimmensity of sand reminds me of the words, 'Bless our Lord Mahomet as\r\nmuch as the sand is extended,' and I understood now their full import.\"\r\n\r\nBut here in the centre of this wilderness of sand we had an abundant\r\nproof of the goodness of a good God. Whilst mourning over this horrible\r\nscene of monotonous desolation, and wondering why such regions were\r\ncreated in vain, we came upon _The Wells of Mislah_, where we encamped\r\nfor the day. These are not properly wells, for the sand being removed in\r\nvarious places, about four or five feet below the surface, the water\r\nruns out. Indeed, we were obliged to make our own wells. Each party of\r\nthe ghafalah dug a well for itself. Ghafalahs are divided into so many\r\nparties, varying in size from five men and twenty camels, to ten men and\r\nforty camels. Three or four wells were dug out in this way. Some of the\r\nplaces had been scooped out before. Water may be found through all the\r\nvalley of Mislah. A few dwarfish palms are in the valley, but which don't\r\nbear fruit. The camels, finding nothing else to eat, attacked voraciously\r\ntheir branches. It is surprising the sand is not more scattered over the\r\nwells and trees, for on the south-west is a lofty sand-hill, deserving\r\nthe name of a mountain, almost overhanging the pits. Here is a sufficient\r\nproof, at once, that The Desert has no sandy waves like the Desert Ocean\r\nof waters, as poets and credulous or exaggerating writers have been\r\npleased to inform us. Were this the case, the wells of Mislah would have\r\nbeen long ago heaped up and over with pile upon pile of sand-hills, and\r\ncaravans would have abandoned for ever this line of route. For we can\r\nhardly suppose that one sand-storm would cover the pits of Mislah with a\r\nmountain pile of sand, and the next sand-storm uncover them and lay them\r\nbare to the amazed Saharan traveller. On the contrary, the pits of Mislah\r\nand the stunted palms have every appearance of having remained as they\r\nnow are for centuries. The hills are huge groups, some single ones,\r\nglaring in sun above the rest, and others pyramidical. The sand at times\r\nis also very firm to the camel's tread. Shall I say a _terra firma_ in\r\nloose shifting sands? But for the water of Mislah it is extremely\r\nbrackish, nay salt. I had observed between the sand-hills small valleys,\r\nor bottoms, covered with, a whitish substance which I now find salt. Both\r\nmen and camels are alike condemned to drink this water. I try it with\r\nboiling and tea and find it worse, and cannot drink it, so I'm obliged to\r\nbeg of our people the remaining sweet water of Nather, left in the skins.\r\nOur people confess themselves, in summer when this water gets hot they\r\ncan scarcely drink it, being veritable brine. An European travelling this\r\nroute should always provide himself with water enough at the well of\r\nNather to last him from six to eight days. My skin-bags have got out of\r\norder, and I did not make inquiries of the people about this well. At one\r\nwell a traveller should always make inquiry about the water of the next\r\nwell. This is indispensable if an European tourist would have water fit\r\nto drink. The Mislah water is full of saline particles, and is purging\r\nevery body. The valley of Mislah, over which we are encamped, is not more\r\nthan twenty minutes' walking in length, and half this in breadth. In many\r\nparts the sand is encrusted with a beautiful white salt. One of the Arabs\r\nof Souf said to me, \"See, Yâkob, this is our country, all Souf is like\r\nthis.\" So it appears an oasis may exist in a region of _shifting_ (?)\r\nsands. Are these the shifting sands which bury whole caravans beneath\r\ntheir sandy billows, when lashed up by the Desert tempest[63]?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of what Colonel Warrington told me of some tourist, who\r\ndescribes himself as killing a camel to procure the water from its\r\nstomach, when within a couple days from Tripoli, and on a spot where\r\nthere was a splendid spring of never-failing water. I often asked the\r\nArabs, if they ever killed the camel to get the water from its stomach?\r\nThey replied, \"They had often heard of such things.\" A merchant of\r\nGhadames made, however, an apposite observation: \"This is our sea, here\r\nwe travel as you in your sea, bringing our provisions and water with us.\"\r\n\r\nThese pits are considered the half-way house or station to Ghat. I'm told\r\nthe route from Ghat to Aheer is much more easy and agreeable than this.\r\nTrust I shall find it so if I go. Begin to feel this irksome, and am in\r\nlow spirits. People try to amuse me, and I have received many little\r\npresents of date-cakes and bazeen from them. Begin to relish this sort of\r\nfood, and The Desert air sharpens the appetite. Yesterday, a slave of the\r\nghafalah amused us with playing his rude bagpipe through these weary\r\nwastes. We are not very merry. There is very little conversation; we move\r\non for hours in the most unbroken silence, nothing being said or\r\nwhispered, no sound but the dull slow tread of the camel. Sometimes an\r\nArab strikes up one of his plaintive ditties, and thinks of his green\r\nolive-clad mountain home in the Atlas. Happily there is little or no\r\nquarrelling. I am sure sixty people of all ages and tempers, were they\r\nEuropeans, travelling in this region of blank monotony, oppressed with\r\nsombre reflections and without anything to relieve the senses, would not\r\nmanage things so smoothly, or without quarrelling, and at times most\r\ndesperately. For we are a _bonâ fide_ moving city, and at each well every\r\nbody prepares to start afresh. Some mend their torn clothes, others the\r\nbroken gear of the camels, others take out the raw materials from their\r\nbags and work up a new supply of provisions. Others wash and shave. Our\r\nSaharan travellers rarely wash themselves except at the wells. Their\r\nreligion requires of them to wash their hands at their meals, but this\r\nthey evade by rubbing their hands with a little sand, a privilege,\r\nhowever, Mahomet has only granted them when they can find no water. We\r\nfollowed the tracks of the few of our party who had preceded us. Here\r\nalso the footstep is rigidly observed as in the American wilderness, and\r\nthe people pretend to distinguish the foot-print of the bandit on the\r\nsand from that of an honest man. But one night of strong wind usually\r\ncovers up the track, and though the sand does not move in billows, it\r\nflies about, first from one side and then the other, and fills up the\r\nfoot-prints of men and animals. There is no doubt but it requires the\r\nmost practised eye of the camel-driver to find his way through these\r\nregions, and yet, for my life, I could not see that the people\r\nexperienced any difficulty. They seemed as much at home in this intricate\r\nwaste of creation as in their own dark zigzag streets of Ghadames.\r\n\r\nAs the sun goes down and night comes on, the sand-hills, from shining\r\nwhite, look as dark and drear as earth-hills. But how smooth is all! If\r\nthey were hills of blown glass they could not be more smooth. In the\r\nsketch of Mislah will be seen a date-tree with part of its branches\r\ndepending, forming with the up-rising a curious shape. The under foliage\r\nis dead and dried up, a fit object in the desolate scene. Not a single\r\nliving creature about the wells. No bird is here. At Maseen and Nather we\r\nhad seen two or three small birds, hopping about the wells, picking up\r\nthe crumbs and scattered grain of the passing caravan. Except the little\r\nvegetable life, all else here is \"a universe of death!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] A _cantar_ is about an English hundred-weight.\r\n\r\n[63] Oudney says:--\"The presence of nothing but deep sand-valleys\r\n    and high sand-hills strikes the mind forcibly. There is something\r\n    of the sublime mixed with the melancholy. Who cannot contemplate\r\n    without admiration masses of loose sand fully four hundred feet\r\n    high, ready to be tossed about by every breeze, and not shudder\r\n    with horror at the idea of the unfortunate traveller being\r\n    entombed in a moment by one of these fatal blasts, _which\r\n    sometimes occur_?\" I agree with the Doctor about the sublime and\r\n    melancholy mixed in contemplating these regions of sand. But they\r\n    are by no means dangerous. No people that I heard of had been\r\n    entombed under these fatal blasts. I am almost sorry now that I\r\n    did not pass through the region of Mislah in a Saharan hurricane,\r\n    and then I should have known all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nFROM GHADAMES TO GHAT.\r\n\r\n     End of the Sandy Region.--No Birds of Prey in The\r\n     Sahara.--Progress of the French in the Algerian Oases.--Slave\r\n     Trade of The Desert supported by European Merchants.--Desolations\r\n     of Sahara.--System of Living of our People.--Various Tours\r\n     through Central Africa.--The Desert tenanted by harmless and\r\n     Domesticated Animals.--Horribly dreary Day's March.--A Fall from\r\n     my Camel.--Well of Nijberten, and its delicious Water.--Moral\r\n     Character of the People of our Caravan.--Well of\r\n     Tăbăbothteen.--Camel knocked up and killed.--Mode of Killing\r\n     Camels.--Pretty Aspect of The Sahara.--Some of the Ghafalah go on\r\n     before the rest.--The Plain and Well of Tadoghseen.--Encounter\r\n     and Adventure with the _quasi_ Bandit Sheik, Ouweek.--Enter the\r\n     region of the _Jenoun_ or Genii.--Mountain Range of Wareerat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_6th._--ROSE at day-break but did not start until after sun-rise.\r\nContinued through the sand. Scenery as yesterday, hills heaped upon\r\nheap, group around group, and sometimes a plain of sand, furrowed in\r\npretty tesselated squares like the sands of the sea-shore. I walked\r\nabout three hours to ease the nagah. The camels continued to\r\nflounder in the sand, throwing over their necks their heavy burdens.\r\nThe ascents extremely difficult: people employed in scooping an\r\ninclined path for the animals. But, in the afternoon, about three,\r\nwe saw through an opening of the shining heaps, a blue and black\r\nwaste of contiguous desert. I could not help crying out for joy,\r\nlike a man at the prow who descries the port, after having been\r\nbuffeted about many a stormy day by contrary winds and currents.\r\nMuch fatigued with the walking over the sands, and sick with\r\ndrinking the brackish water of Mislah. Nothing _en route_ to-day\r\nexcept four crows, and a skeleton of a camel. This is the small crow of\r\nThe Sahara (‮غراب الصحرا‬). People pretend it does not drink\r\nwater. It may live on the flesh of the few camels which drop down\r\nand die from exhaustion, and on lizards. There are, however, no\r\nvultures and ravenous birds of huge dimensions in this region of\r\nSahara. So that,\r\n\r\n    ‮حيثما يكون الجسد ايضا تجتمع النسور‬\r\n\r\n\"Where the body is, there also collect the eagles,\" is not applicable to\r\nthis part of The Desert, although the vulture, pouncing voraciously upon\r\nthe dead man and dying camel, is an appropriate feature in Saharan\r\nlandscapes. The large birds of prey do not find, as the lion, water to\r\ndrink in these regions. When we got fairly upon the firm ground of Stony\r\nSahara, I was refreshed with the sight of seven small acacia trees. This\r\nseems to be the only tree which will not surrender to the iron sceptre of\r\nSaharan desolation, for it strikes its roots into the sterility itself. A\r\nwhite butterfly also, to my amazement, passed my camel's head! Where does\r\nthe little fluttering thing get its food in this region of desolation?\r\n\r\nAnother of the Souf Arabs said to me this morning, \"This sand is the\r\ncountry of the Souafah and the Shânbah.\" If so, indeed, it would be a\r\ntroublesome country for a military expedition. \"However,\" said a\r\nmerchant, \"the maharee can pursue the Shânbah to the last heap of their\r\nsands.\" Speaking of the Shânbah last evening when we were in the midst of\r\nthe sands, the Souafah said:--\"When the enemy will come, we shall cover\r\nourselves in the sand, and fire off our matchlocks. They will feel our\r\nbullets, and hear our report, and look about and see no person. We shall\r\nbe covered up in the sand.\" This, the Souf Arab repeated several times,\r\nand the Ghadamsee traders thought it astonishingly clever and courageous.\r\nIt is reported five hundred Touaricks are soon to pursue the Shânbah into\r\nthe Algerian territory. It is said also, French Arabs will support the\r\nShânbah bandits against both Touaricks and Souafah. Such is the silly\r\ntalk of our caravan. Still the French have got far south, and my Souafah\r\ncompanions acknowledge that some of their districts pay tribute to the\r\nAlgerian authorities. This is something like _progress_, and we ought not\r\nto deceive ourselves about their movements southwards. Nothing is worse\r\nthan self-deception. The Romans struggled long before they made any\r\nsensible progress in Africa, nay, several centuries. In fifteen years the\r\nFrench have induced a whole line of Saharan oases, more or less, to\r\nacknowledge their authority. And the thing is done cleverly enough; they\r\ndo not appoint a local governor, or dispatch a single soldier, and yet\r\nthey manage to get some money from these distant Saharan oases. However,\r\nthis tribute must be very trifling; and were all this line of Algerian\r\noases to pay their tribute regularly, it would be as a drop in the bucket\r\ncompared with the thousands of millions of francs which have been spent,\r\nand will be spent in Algeria. Such a colony as Algeria will not only not\r\npay, but will ruin the finances of a score of kingdoms as large as\r\nFrance. The politics of our moving Saharan city are mostly confined to\r\nthe Pasha of Tripoli and the French in Algeria. \"When will the Pasha go,\r\nsoon or late? Will another come after him? Will he be better? Will he\r\nfleece us as this despot, of all our money? Have the French many troops\r\nin Algeria? Have they more than Muley Abd-Errahman? Could they conquer\r\nMorocco? Why don't the English drive out the French from Algeria? The\r\nMussulmans of Algeria are now corrupted by the money of the Christians.\r\nThe Bey of Tunis is the friend of the French. The Sultan of\r\nConstantinople, Mehemet Ali, and the English are against the Bey of Tunis\r\nand the French. Now, the Christians have great power in the world, but\r\nthey will soon be cut off, when shall appear the new warrior of the\r\nfaithful. Is the Sultan of Stamboul strong? Has he more soldiers than\r\nMoskou (Russia)? Have the French more soldiers than the English? Is\r\nMehemet Ali to have Tripoli given him, and is he to march on to Tunis and\r\nagainst the French?\" &c. All these, and a thousand other questions and\r\nopinions similar, agitate the sage politicians of our ghafalah: so true\r\nit is, that when we change the heavens above, we do not change our\r\nthoughts on the things below, which are left behind us.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Zaleâ, of Seenawan, did not come with us, he having contracted\r\nfor the building of the caravansary of Emjessem, but his brother, a rough\r\nbold Arab, accompanied us, who assured me to-day,--\"That all the goods of\r\nthe ghafalah were the property of Christians and Jews in Tripoli, and the\r\nGhadamseeah merchants were only their commission agents. These goods were\r\nto be exchanged for Soudan merchandise, including slaves, which latter,\r\nafter being sold in Tripoli, the money of their sale would be given up to\r\nthe merchants under European protection.\" This is a strong confirmation\r\nof the opinion which I have expressed in my reports, \"_That the\r\nslave-traffic of Tripoli is supported by the money and goods of\r\nEuropeans_.\" My informant wished to know and put the question:--\"If I\r\ntake you (the writer) to Soudan, and bring you back safe, will you get me\r\nfree from paying taxes to the Pasha?\" Another observed on this,--\"That's\r\nridiculous, Yâkob; if you say that Mahomet is the prophet of God, you can\r\ngo safe to Soudan without the protection of any body.\" I made answer to\r\nthis impertinence, that such language was not proper, and if they\r\ncontinued to pester me with their religion, I should report them to Rais\r\nMustapha. This at once silenced them.\r\n\r\nFelt very sick this evening with drinking the water of Mislah. It is\r\npurging all the people like genuine Epsom.\r\n\r\n_7th._--Started a little before sun-rise, when a clear mist was spread\r\nlike a mantle of gauze over old Sahara, and lost the sight of the\r\nsand-hills in the course of the morning. I joyfully bid them adieu,\r\nthough it may be very fine and Desert-like to talk and write of regions\r\nof sand and sandy billows, furrowing the bosom of Sahara. Winding about,\r\nbut always making south. Wind now from the west; the sky mostly overcast,\r\nbut no signs of rain. No living things _en route_, but a solitary crow,\r\nand another solitary butterfly. The mirage again visible. Very little\r\nherbage for the camels, and no wood for the fire. On our right long\r\nranges of low hills, dull and drear outlines of The Desert. In some\r\nmasses, the stone and earth and chalk are thrown together in confusion,\r\nas so many materials for creating a new world. Those who traverse these\r\nSaharan desolations, cannot but receive the impression, that old mother\r\nearth, slung on her balance, and revolving on her axis, has performed\r\neternal cycles of decay and reproduction. Time was, when these heaps of\r\ndesolation were fruitful fields of waving corn and smiling meadows, and\r\nfair branching woods, meandered about with running rills of silvery\r\nstreams, where cattle pastured lowing, and birds sang on the trees. Now,\r\nheap upon heap, and pile upon pile of the ruins of nature deform the\r\ndreadful landscape, one feature being more hideous to look upon than the\r\nother: and the whole is a mass of blank existence, having no apparent\r\nobject but to daunt and terrify the hapless wayfarer, who with his\r\nfaithful camel, slowly and mournfully winds his weary way through the\r\nscene of wasteful destruction. . . . . In the sand, the pebbles are as\r\nbright and smooth as those washed by the sea-spray, or chafed by a\r\nrunning brook.\r\n\r\nI have observed minutely the system of living amongst our people, and\r\nreally believe they have not enough to eat. When they invite me to\r\nsupper, and give me a share of _bazeen_, I always require another supper\r\non my return, before going to bed. Besides, I always make a slight repast\r\nin the morning, which they do not. Then I eat dates and a piece of cake\r\nduring the day's riding, for we never stop during the day's march. They\r\nalso munch a few dates themselves. But, altogether, though I'm a moderate\r\neater, I believe I eat every day twice, and sometimes thrice, as much as\r\nthey eat. With respect to clothing, I wear double the quantity they do,\r\nand, nevertheless, feel cold at night. I may say with truth, they are\r\npoorly fed and badly clothed. It is this miserable system of living which\r\nmakes them such lanky bare-boned objects. I observe, also, they feel the\r\nfatigue very much, as much as I myself, though unwell with drinking the\r\nwater and serving a hard apprenticeship to Desert-travelling.\r\n\r\nI believe Europeans, in this season of the year, would travel these\r\nSaharan wilds with less fatigue, and in far superior style. I now walk\r\ntwo hours first thing every morning. Most of the merchants do the same.\r\nZaleâ said to me, \"Yâkob, we (pointing to three or four of his people)\r\nare the only true men here, and understand affairs; the rest are all\r\ngood-for-nothing.\" Indeed, the Seenawanee Arabs are generally very\r\nexcellent camel-drivers, and know the routes perfectly. We have with us a\r\nyoung Touarick, who never covers his head winter or summer. His hair\r\ngrows long, unlike other Mohammedans, who shave the head. This Targhee\r\ntells me he is never unwell. We're encamped in a valley. As the sun sets,\r\nthe sky is encharged with clouds. But usually the wind goes down a little\r\nafter dark, and rises an hour or two after day-break. Fortunately, this\r\nis not a month of winds, so say the people.\r\n\r\nAs the camel moves slowly, but surely[64], on to Ghat, I still revolve in\r\nmind the various routes of the interior. I'm still as much at a loss as\r\never to determine which route I shall take, and have only Providence for\r\nmy guide. There are various routes before me:--\r\n\r\n1st.--To go to Soudan, _viâ_ Aheer, and return with the ghafalah of\r\nGhadames, with which I proceed. This is easy and simple, but does not\r\noffer much variety.\r\n\r\n2nd.--To proceed to Soudan, _viâ_ Aheer, as in the first, and return\r\n_viâ_ Bornou and Fezzan. This offers both variety and security.\r\n\r\n3rd.--To proceed as before to Soudan, then Bornou, then Darfour,\r\nKordofan, Nubia, and Egypt. This is various, new, and attended with\r\ndanger, but I don't know what extent of danger.\r\n\r\n4th.--To proceed to Soudan, Kanou, and Noufee, and then descend the Niger\r\nto the Bight of Benin. This would be a fine journey, and perhaps not\r\nattended with any very great difficulties.\r\n\r\n5th.--To proceed to Soudan, as above, thence along the upper banks of the\r\nNiger to Timbuctoo, and return _viâ_ Mogador in Morocco. This I believe\r\nthe most perilous of all the routes.\r\n\r\nAny of these routes, however, could not fail to be useful to commerce,\r\ngeography, and discovery. Those who take the route of descending the\r\nNiger to the ocean, will avoid a three or four months' journey over The\r\nDesert. Noufee, on the Niger, is only fifteen days from Kanou, and seven\r\nto the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nTo-day passed several tumuli of stones, more than eight feet high,\r\nevidently placed to direct the caravans over the trackless portions of\r\nSahara. I wonder what the people of Europe will say when I tell them,\r\nthat The Desert--pictured in such frightful colours by the ancients, as\r\nteeming with monsters and wild beasts, and every unearthly and uncouth\r\nthing and being, not forgetting the dragons, salamanders, vampyres,\r\ncockatrices, and fiery-flying serpents, and as such believed in these our\r\nenlightened days--is a very harmless place, its menagerie being reduced\r\nto a few small crows, and now and then a stray butterfly, and a few\r\ncommon house and cheese-and-bacon and fruit flies! these poor little\r\ndomestic everyday creatures! Nay, there is not found here the wild ox,\r\nor the oudad, or the antelope, or ostrich, or the wild boar, or any other\r\nanimal which inhabit and mark the Saharan regions near the north coast of\r\nAfrica. It is, indeed, impossible to conceive of a country so devoid of\r\nliving creatures as the route which we have traversed these last twelve\r\ndays. To this must be added, that now is the favourable season for\r\nanimals, and we should certainly see them if there were any to be seen.\r\n\r\nOf the four routes to Ghat, the next to us on the west, is the shortest.\r\nPeople say the route which we are now travelling is only frequented in\r\nthis season, and mostly by large caravans, or scarcely ever in the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n_8th._--Rose at day-break and started at sunrise: as usual, the sky\r\novercast and in an hour the wind got up and blew a strong gale awhile\r\nfrom the south-east. To-day Sahara looked unusually dark and drear; night\r\nas a dread pall seemed to hang on the day and all visible things--all\r\nlife and animation was extinct but our lone, solitary, melancholy\r\ncaravan! We moved on in deep and weary silence, not a noise, a cry, a\r\nmurmur, the grumbling of the camels was even hushed. Nothing broke the\r\nhorrid silence of The Desert. We wound round long-long winding valleys--\r\n\r\n        \"Through many a dark and dreary vale\r\n    [We] pass'd, and many a region dolorous--\"\r\n            \"Where all life dies.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the stone scattered _en route_ was black shingle, and all\r\nthe region had a volcanic look. In one wady through which we passed\r\nwere found several stones rounded into (shall I call them?)\r\ncannon-balls, scattered about, and some were of prodigious size.\r\nThey were as round as if artificially made. There were also a great\r\nmany halves, or half balls. Our people to divert their minds from\r\nthe gloom hanging around them dismounted and amused themselves with\r\nthese cannon-balls of nature. Some would say that nature furnishes a\r\ntype of every thing in art. Our Touaricks assured us, \"These balls\r\nwere made by the Jenoun, who on occasion of quarrels, pelted one\r\nanother with them. A traveller was once killed with some of these\r\nballs during the night, although a friend of the Jenoun.\" In a\r\nformer period, I imagine the action of water produced these\r\nspecimens of stony rotundity, for they were embedded in a deep wady.\r\nOn leaving this valley, I had also something else to relieve me from\r\nthe gloom of this day's march. On mounting a small ridge of rock,\r\nabrupt, and full of sharp stones, I was pitched off in a summerset\r\nstyle from the back of the camel, and if I had not been caught in my\r\nfall by a slave of the caravan, I should have fallen once and for\r\never in this world; as it was, I felt stunned and considerably hurt.\r\nThis was my first and last fall from the camel. I learnt caution at\r\na great risk. The people all crowded round to assist me, terribly\r\nfrightened. My thick woollen clothes saved my bones. I could not\r\nhelp remarking the coincidence of being saved by a slave, for the\r\nbenefit of whom I had chiefly undertaken this perilous journey. In\r\ngeneral, the camel goes extremely steady, it is only in mounting and\r\ndescending that they become unsteady, unwieldy, and dangerous. At\r\nother times, you may sleep, eat and drink, read and write, on the\r\nback of a camel. But as our days are short and nights long, we require\r\nno sleep, and my eyes are too bad for reading. Our people call camels\r\nby the Arabic term _bâeer_ (‮بعير‬), the male camel is called\r\n_jemel_ (‮جمل‬), and the female _nagah_ (‮ناقه‬). As the\r\nshe-camel is most valuable for the sustenance of the tribes, the\r\nTouaricks sometimes call the whole race of camels nagah. \"We,\" say\r\nthey, \"have nothing but the _nagah_ (she-camel),\" thereby meaning,\r\nour property alone consists in camels. But the nagah is a great\r\nfavourite with the Mussulmans of all nations. Mahomet mounted a\r\nmilk-white nagah, when he ascended to paradise. The camels have all\r\npublic and private marks, the former for their country, and the\r\nlatter for their owner, and, strange enough, the public mark of the\r\nGhadames camels is the English broad R. So when a camel is stolen, a\r\nman claims his camel by his mark. The marking is done by branding\r\nwith a hot iron.\r\n\r\nI can't help observing the habits of the camels, for our continued\r\nmarching affords us ample leisure. When these melancholy creatures can\r\nfind no other occupation _en route_, or when there is nothing _en route_,\r\nor after a full belly, they set to work, like men, and bite one another.\r\nOften one of the camels falls, or throws its load, in a regular\r\nencounter. The Moors and Arabs are bad loaders of the camels, and there\r\nis always some camel with its load falling off. In fact, the people do\r\nnothing neat and well. Even the little gear required for these animals is\r\ncontinually breaking and getting out of order. People look to the\r\nimmediate hour before them: not excepting even the necessary articles of\r\nfodder and water, and food for themselves, of which they often neglect to\r\ntake a sufficient supply. And yet if anything could teach a man to be\r\nprovident it is The Desert. If this Saharan travelling were placed under\r\nthe management of Europeans, it would be infinitely more secure. Our\r\ncamels are nearly all coast-camels, we shall soon have to speak of the\r\nmaharee. The Touarghee uses quite a different style of address when he\r\ncoaxes along the camels; it is bolder and quicker in its intonations,\r\nsuited to the language of the Touaricks. A frequent address of\r\nencouragement is, \"_Bok, bok bok, bokka bokka_.\" The Arabs usually\r\ncommand the movement of the camels by \"Tzâ;\" and when they are to stop,\r\nby \"Ush;\" and, to kneel down, it is a prolonged pronunciation of the\r\nguttural ‮خ‬ or Kh-h-h. We may well suppose, however, that the camels\r\nwhich travel this route are expert linguists in the Touarghee and Arabic.\r\n\r\nWe continued all day till the last dull departing solar ray of the west\r\nhad left us. A long dark, dismal, dreary day it has been. We encamped\r\namidst two long ranges of Saharan mountains as a shelter from the wind.\r\nOur people detest the wind, they prefer burning heat to wind. The\r\nmountains only deserve the name from their frightfully gloomy aspect, not\r\nfrom their consistence or magnitude, for in reality they are so much\r\nstony and earthy rubbish shovelled up into long ridges. There is nothing\r\nin shape or consistence of granite. I picked up several pieces of\r\npetrified wood, but none of them pretty or remarkable. So far as I can\r\njudge, there are no minerals or rare stones to repay the researches of\r\nthe geologist in these regions of desolation. Noticed a quantity of soft\r\ngrey stone, as also of slate stone: observed some lime-stone gradually\r\nacquiring the consistence and colour of fine streaky marble.\r\n\r\n_9th._--Rose as the day broke, and started with the first rays of the\r\nsun. Continued through the same kind of country, with an addition of a\r\nlittle sand here and there, for five hours, until we arrived at the well\r\nof Nijberten, to our great joy, for it is a well of deliciously sweet\r\nwater. Around the well, I was pleased with the sight of several dark\r\nbushes scattered upon the small sand-hills. Anything in the shape of a\r\ntree now gladdens the heart. I observe again, that vegetation often\r\nsprings out of the sand in preference to the hard or even softer earth in\r\nThe Sahara. A little sand, scattered over the hard earth, and oftener\r\nsolid rock, enables vegetation to spring up, when the mould of Sahara\r\nproduces nothing. But there is little or no herbage for camels. Give my\r\nnagah the barley which I provided for my own use. People ridicule the\r\nchoice of Rais Mustapha in the purchase of the camel, and say she will\r\nnever carry me to Soudan.\r\n\r\nI'm now writing the journal of yesterday. I can't write every day.\r\nSometimes several days elapse. Often wonder how Denham could write his\r\njournal every day, as he asserts. The wind is high and is scattering sand\r\nin every direction. Certainly I require no supply of sand when turning\r\nover my sheet wet with the ink.\r\n\r\nBefore we get to the water, we are obliged to scoop out the sand as at\r\nMislah. Many pits in Sahara are in this predicament. But we are\r\ninfinitely more repaid for our pains, for we find most refreshing\r\nnectar-like water, as good as the last was bad. I imagine I drank off a\r\nfull gallon at once. I was praying night and day for this water, and was\r\nobliged to go from tent to tent, begging a drop of the water which was\r\nleft of Nather well, until all the skins were empty of that water. Some\r\nof the merchants kept a little in a small skin as a luxury. But I must do\r\nour people justice, for seeing I could not drink the Mislah water, they\r\ngave me often their sweet water and themselves drank the brackish. I must\r\nadd, I see no striking moral difference between the people of this Desert\r\ncaravan, and the people who fill an English mail-coach or a French\r\ndiligence. Mankind are morally much the same everywhere. The last sixteen\r\ncenturies have added little or nothing to discovery and amendment in\r\nmorals, however orthodox we may all have become. Our Christendom has been\r\nchiefly occupied in resisting the worst features of the Mosaic economy as\r\nengrafted by the corruptions of the Church on the Christian system. The\r\ncommission to Moses, \"to extirpate the Canaanitish tribes,\" has been the\r\nuniversal war-cry of the dominant party in the Church to burn and empale\r\nheretics. There are still many divinity professors who think it right to\r\nkill heretics and infidels. The society of the nineteenth century is\r\nstill eaten up by the most rancorous bigotry, and morality is\r\nproportionably at a low ebb. Nevertheless, with all our present Desert\r\nhardships, we are an easy journeying caravan; the patience of no one is\r\nparticularly tried, and there is no event to draw out the real passions\r\nof the soul. We are now five days from Ghat; to-morrow being the Ayed\r\nKebir, we shall make but a short day. Had a little private conversation\r\nwith a Souf Arab. There are some fifty families of Jews in Souf, occupied\r\nin commerce. Speaking of the eternal quarrel of the Shânbah and Souafah,\r\nI found him a strong partisan of the Shânbah. \"Fine fellows are the\r\nShânbah, like us the Souafah; one Shânbah would kill five Touaricks,\" he\r\nexclaimed. Souf is a rich country. This Souf Arab has thirty fine dughla\r\ndate-trees, one of finest species. Riches are estimated by the number of\r\ndate-trees. He has two brothers now returning from Soudan, bringing\r\nslaves and elephants' teeth for the markets of Algeria.\r\n\r\nThe notorious Mohammed Sagheer, who slaughtered thirty Frenchmen in cold\r\nblood at Biscara, is now at Tozer, in Tunis. This flight of fugitives\r\nwill continue as long as France is in North Africa. It is inevitable.\r\nWhen a political refugee is quiet his person should be held sacred; and\r\nit was very dastardly on the part of the French to demand to have this\r\nArab Sheikh given up. But the French mind is incapable of comprehending\r\nwhat is a political asylum, or even what is constitutional freedom. Local\r\npolitics still stick close to our ghafalah, and the people have such\r\nfaith in my power and influence, that they really believe I could, if I\r\nwould, get Ghadames freed from paying tribute to the Porte. An Arab of\r\nDerge said, \"If you return from Soudan, and speak to the English Consul\r\nand English Sultan, you will then serve us in Derge and Ghadames, but if\r\nyou don't come back we are all lost.\" The British Consul of Tripoli\r\nmight, indeed, do something for these oppressed people, and save the\r\nSaharan commerce from impending ruin. I quiet the people by telling them,\r\n(and which is the fact,) I have repeatedly written to the English Consul\r\nof Tripoli about their affairs, and to obtain some mitigation of the\r\noppression of their Government.\r\n\r\nThe bushes springing out of the sand are but a couple of feet high, and\r\ntheir dark foliage is covered with crystallized salt. They are a stinted\r\nspecies of acacia. Nijberten is the first Touarghee name _en route_, and\r\nnow we are fairly in the Ghat territory. On our right, a day's journey\r\nover some ranges of hills, are tents and flocks and inhabited districts.\r\nPassed several tumuli of stones raised in the shape of graves. To-day the\r\nstone had a better appearance, a good deal of grey and red marble, and\r\nsome isolated blocks of granite. No birds, insects, or animals. Course\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n_10th._--Strong wind all day, and cold. The Ayed Kebir. But our\r\ntravellers only prayed a little longer in the morning. Travellers are\r\nexempt from the ordinary religious ceremonies and festivals. This feast\r\nis usually kept up three days. A camel knocked up to-day, and unloaded\r\nthis morning. After two hours and half, passed on the right the well of\r\n_Tăbăbothteen_. People say its water is still sweeter than that of\r\nNijberten. Indeed, we shall find the Ghat water to be usually sweet and\r\ndelicious. Scenery as usual, broken in valleys, hills, and high ground.\r\nSome of the hills, covered partly with sand, looked very pretty at a\r\ndistance, shrouded as if in a sheet of snow, and dazzling in the\r\nsun-beams. Encamped early in the afternoon. The knocked-up camel\r\ndifficult to be got on. A Divan of camel-drivers was held, and the\r\nquestion discussed, \"Whether the camel should be killed?\" It was decided\r\nthat it should be doctored and left to graze until a Targhee was sent\r\nfrom Ghat for it. A most piteous sight it was to look upon the poor\r\ncamel, prostrate and moaning, as if pleading the excuse of its malady for\r\nnot moving on. I could not stop to look at the wretched animal.\r\nNevertheless, I returned again, and found the camel tied down, with its\r\nmouth pulled open, and its jaws lashed back with cords, to prevent the\r\npoor creature from groaning too loud. The hot iron was being applied to\r\nthe shoulder, where there were some festering or dislocation; meanwhile,\r\nthe creature groaned in dreadful but silent agonies. At length, this\r\ndoctoring finished, it was left to graze; but being actually nearly burnt\r\nto death, it could not get up, and was killed during the night, _to\r\nprevent it from dying_, in order that our orthodox people might eat the\r\nflesh like good Mussulmans.\r\n\r\nRais Mustapha amused me by telling how that the Arabs watched the signs\r\nof immediate death, and just stuck the camel in the last agony of\r\ndissolution, in order that they might eat the flesh with an orthodox\r\nconscience. Camels are killed differently from other animals. Sheep and\r\nbullocks and fowls have their throats cut from side to side, with\r\n\"hideous gash,\" for they are the most slashing throat-cutters; camels, on\r\nthe contrary, are stuck in the throat at the bottom of the neck, and the\r\ntop of the chest-bones. Next morning (_11th_), was held a Divan of the\r\nwhole ghafalah to decide upon the value of the slaughtered camel, for the\r\nowner was in Ghadames. Its worth was estimated at four dollars. I\r\npurchased a quarter of a dollar's worth. The camel was young, but the\r\nmeat not very good. Our people soon devoured the meat.\r\n\r\n_11th._--Rose early, but did not start till near noon, to give the camels\r\nmore rest. Old Sahara looks absolutely pretty with the dark shrubs\r\nbespotting and besprinkling his white shining sand-hills. The heavens are\r\nstrewn with soft flaky light clouds; the blue above is clear and\r\nprofound, and what other colours there are, look fresh and fair. Our\r\npeople catch the lighter and more exhilarating influence, and are more\r\ntalkative to-day. Descending to grosser matters, they are joking about\r\nhow much of the camel's meat they are to swallow for supper. A part of\r\nthe ghafalah left us, as the main body would not start early, thinking\r\nto arrive a couple of days before us in Ghat. I loaded and wished to go\r\non with them, despising my friend Fletcher's advice. They insisted I\r\nshould not accompany them, but come on with the larger body of people. I\r\nwas obliged to return, and it happened for the best. This was a short\r\nday's march, but wrote no journal. The advanced party excused themselves\r\nfor not letting me go with them, by saying, \"We are going amongst the\r\nTouaricks our friends for a few days, and you will arrive first.\" I\r\nmentioned this to our party, who say, \"_They're liars._ Are you so\r\nfoolish, Yâkob, as to believe every thing a _Mussulman_ tells you?\"\r\n\r\n_12th._--Rose and started with the earliest rays of the Saharan sun.\r\nScenery as usual; but the ranges of Saharan hills assuming a more\r\nbattlemental shape, and darker, blacker colour. Fast approaching the\r\ninhabited districts; saw the traces of a route to Fezzan, on which the\r\nfoot-prints of sheep were visible. Saw some inhabited mountains at a\r\nconsiderable distance, but no peculiar feelings started in the mind, and\r\nI grow weary of the journey. A dull drear and long day. Overtook the\r\nadvanced portion of our ghafalah, and had the laugh at them. We asked\r\nthem, whether they had seen their good friends the Touaricks? whether\r\nthey had brought us fresh eggs, milk, and a whole sheep? We, of course,\r\nbegging our portion of the rich spoil. The people now told me to place my\r\ntent within the circle of the encampment, as we were getting near the\r\ninhabited districts. I usually encamped at a short distance from the\r\ncentre of confusion in the ghafalah, and found it more quiet. As to\r\nfear, I had none, and slept more soundly in the open Desert than in any\r\npart of the world where I had travelled before.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Rose at day-break, and, after a few hours' riding, came in full\r\nview of the Touarick camel-grazing country. We descended into a beautiful\r\nplain. After such Desert, how lovely it was! the plain of the Paradise of\r\nSahara! This plain afforded many a taste of freshest herbage for the\r\ncamels, almost approaching to English grass. They cropped it with\r\nrapacious greediness. Every person's eyes sparkled with delight at seeing\r\nthe famished camels devour the herbage. We stopped half an hour to let\r\nthem graze. Here were butterflies in quantities fluttering about, in\r\ndress of silver white, and gorgeous hues of rubies, and labouring beetles\r\nand industrious ants covering the small turf-hills, all which were to us\r\n\"signs of life,\" and living in the world. We had already seen, before\r\nentering the fair plain, a small flight of larks, and now we feasted our\r\neyes on a few swallows skimming this \"flowery mead,\" for here and there\r\nwere pretty blue and red and yellow wild flowers. A moment I forgot being\r\nin The Desert. The abundance of the herbage arises from there having\r\nrecently fallen copious showers of rain--quite unusual in this thirsty\r\ncountry. But our route is the worst and most desolate of all the routes\r\nfrom Ghadames to Ghat. The other parallel routes always afford more\r\nherbage, besides having some inhabited tracts, with flocks of sheep and\r\nherds of camels feeding. Indeed, with the exception of a few people at\r\nthe well of _Tadoghseen_, which we shall soon mention, we found no\r\ninhabitants in this the most easterly route. Whilst passing through the\r\nplain I espied a little black something moving about. In getting up to\r\nit, to my astonishment it was a little child stark naked! Our people were\r\nas much amazed as myself. I thought within myself, if this be the way in\r\nwhich the Touaricks bring up their children, exposed to cold and heat,\r\nrain and wind, in such terrible plight in open desert! no wonder then\r\nthey can bear all the hardship of The Sahara, as we a spring-day in\r\nEurope. It is impossible for an European to contend with a nature like\r\nthat of the Touarick; we can never expect to adopt their habits of\r\nSaharan travelling. The little wretched urchin had been left by some of\r\nthe shepherds, for camels, goats, and donkeys were feeding about. The\r\nchild was very merry, but not old enough to speak much. Our people gave\r\nthe boy a piece of bread, which he put at once to his mouth, and grinned\r\n\"a thank you.\" From the plain rises a huge block of rock in the shape of\r\na sugar-loaf, a frequent form of blocks of rock in this desert. As we\r\nneared the well, I was greatly rejoiced at the arrival of two slaves, one\r\nof which had been dispatched by the Sheikh Jabour from Ghat, to tell me,\r\n\"I was to come with all confidence to Ghat, to fear nothing; no Touarghee\r\nshould say an untoward word to me.\" I augured well of all things on the\r\nreceipt of such news. Our people were as pleased as myself on the arrival\r\nof Jabour's slave. They called out to me to take the handkerchief from\r\noff my face, to let the messenger see \"the face of a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nAfter riding further, three or four Touaricks showed themselves. I\r\nsaluted them. They asked our people what I said, and did not seem very\r\nfriendly. I began to have suspicions[65]. The advanced portion of the\r\nghafalah had disposed of their camels and baggage before I got up to the\r\nwell. Said and myself went up amongst the people encamping, but, looking\r\non my left about fifty yards' distant, I saw a group of people and a\r\nquarrel going on between our people, four or five Touaricks, and two\r\nslaves. Our people were violently pulling a slave one way, and Ouweek, a\r\nTouarghee chief, tearing him as savagely the other way. At length the\r\nslave, struggling stoutly, got free, and went further off to a horse.\r\nOuweek thought the slave intended to mount the horse and ride off to\r\nGhat; so the chief followed the slave and again seized hold of him, and\r\nunsheathing his sword, began beating him with its sides. The Ghadamsee\r\npeople and Arabs again interfered and rescued the slave. In the meanwhile\r\nHaj Mafoul Zuleâ passed me, and said, \"Go up, go up.\" I replied, \"Why? I\r\nshall stop here, where I am.\" He answered something; but, being hard of\r\nhearing, I could not catch what he said. I determined not to move.\r\nAfterwards, thinking that Zuleâ wished me not to be mixed up with the\r\nquarrel, I went further on towards Ghat. I imagined the slave had been\r\noverriding his master's horse, and was being beaten for that. After\r\nstaying some time up the road, I returned to my camel, tired of waiting,\r\nand sat down, telling Said to unpack. But it seems Said had heard\r\nsomething which I had not, and said, \"Not yet, not yet.\" I insisted upon\r\nhis unloading the camel, and took out some dates and biscuits, and lay\r\nmyself down to eat them. The scuffle and uproar was now going on about a\r\nhundred yards from me, and I saw the sword of Ouweek flourishing and\r\nflashing about. This was succeeded by a calm, and a whole circle of\r\npeople squatted down around Ouweek. Meanwhile, the three followers of the\r\nSheikh went a short distance off, spread their heiks upon the ground with\r\ngreat and solemn parade, and performed the afternoon prayer, as if about\r\nto sanctify some impending act of their Sheikh. I watched them anxiously.\r\nWhen I had waited half an hour or so, several of our people, with Zuleâ,\r\nreturned, and not a little surprised me by making to me the following\r\nannouncement:--\"Ouweek, the Touarghee Sheikh of this district, wants to\r\nkill you, because you are a Christian and an infidel. He has just been\r\nbeating one of the slaves for going to meet you, accompanying the\r\nmessenger of Ghat. He wished you to come up to him, that he might\r\ndispatch you at once.\" To say the truth, I had such confidence in the\r\nTouaricks of Ghat, and had been so confirmed in my confidence by the\r\narrival of the messenger from Ghat, that I could not believe this speech\r\nof our people, and was disposed to think it a joke. I was perfectly cool,\r\nand myself. But as they most seriously reiterated this story, and let out\r\na hint, or I gave the hint, I'm sure I now forget in the confusion, that\r\nperhaps the business could be compromised for money, I said to the\r\nspokesman, Zuleâ, \"Oh! for God's sake, go, go; yes, yes, make a bargain.\"\r\nI noticed poor Said at the time, who was staring at me full in the face,\r\nto see, it would appear, how I was affected by this most unexpected\r\nincident. After a great deal of squabbling and bargaining, in a true\r\nmercantile style, it was finally arranged. Ouweek first fiercely\r\ndemanded one thousand dollars! Hereupon all the people cried out that I\r\nhad no money. The _quasi_-bandit, nothing receding, \"Why, the Christian's\r\nmattress is full of money,\" pointing to it still on the camel, for he was\r\nvery near me, although I could not distinguish his features. The\r\nTouaricks who had come to see me before I arrived at the well, observed,\r\n\"He has money on his coat, it is covered with money,\" alluding to the\r\nbuttons. All our people, again, swore solemnly I had no money but paper,\r\nwhich I should change on my arrival at Ghat. The bandit, drawing in his\r\nhorns, \"Well, the Christian has a nagah.\" \"No,\" said the people, \"the\r\ncamel belongs to us; he hires it.\" The bandit, giving way, \"Well, the\r\nChristian has a slave, there he is,\" pointing to Said, \"I shall have the\r\nslave.\" \"No, no,\" cried the people, \"the English have no slaves. Said is\r\na free slave.\" The bandit, now fairly worsted, full of rage, exclaimed,\r\n\"What are you going to do with me, am I not to kill this infidel, who has\r\ndared to come to my country without my permission[66]?\" Hereat, the\r\nmessenger from Ghat, Jabour's slave, of whom the bandit was afraid, and\r\ndared not lay a hand upon, interposed, and, assuming an air of defiance,\r\nsaid, \"I am come from my Sultan, Jabour; if you kill the Christian, you\r\nmust kill me first. The order of my Sultan is, No man is to say a word to\r\nthe Christian.\" Our people now took courage from this noble conduct of\r\nthe slave, declaring, \"If Yâkob is beaten, we will all be beat first; if\r\nYâkob is to be killed, we will be killed likewise.\" Ouweek now saw he\r\nmust come down in his pretensions. The bargain was struck, after infinite\r\nwrangling, for a houlee and a jibbah, of the value of four dollars[67]! I\r\ndid not, therefore, \"sell for much,\" and Christians at four dollars per\r\nhead in The Desert must be considered very cheap. It is said, every man\r\nhas his price; I had not the honour of fixing my price. This was done for\r\nme, and I ratified the bargain. I made a present of a turban to the brave\r\nmessenger, whom the people assured me acted a most noble part. It is\r\nstrange that this is the second time I have been preserved from something\r\nlike a catastrophe by the interposition of a slave. Did Providence intend\r\nthis as any sign of approbation of my anti-slavery labours? We were all\r\nuneasy. Everybody had to supply something; and it was hinted, that I\r\nought to send them supper. Our people did this, and would not allow me,\r\nsaying, that I lived with them and had no provisions of my own. I was\r\nindignant at the conduct of the Souf Arabs, who cowered down before the\r\nTouaricks, and belied all their previous pretensions to courage and\r\nintrepidity. Even a Seenawan Arab was frightened at my coming near his\r\ntent, in dread of another quarrel or attack during the night. All our\r\npeople more or less were alarmed and agitated, although we numbered sixty\r\nin the presence of five Touaricks! I thought in myself, What arrant\r\ncowards you are! To cover their cowardice they pretended the Sheikh had\r\nhundreds of people not far off. Zaleâ, and his Arabs, certainly behaved\r\nthe best. Zaleâ, in fact, was now the only man of the caravan. He told me\r\nafterwards, the Ghadamsee people had proposed to him, that I should run\r\naway on to Ghat, but he would not sanction such pusillanimity. I confess,\r\nhowever, when the people described to me the character of Ouweek, I\r\nmyself felt considerable alarm. During the succeeding night, I slept\r\nscarcely a wink. I made the messenger of Jabour sleep close by my\r\nmattress, and unsheathing Said's old rusty sword, laid it beside me,\r\ndetermining \"to die game,\" or put a good face upon the matter. At any\r\nrate, I thought an Englishman could not, however he might trust the good\r\nfaith of these people, die like an unresisting coward. Ouweek, like a\r\ntrue politician, feasted the messenger dispatched from Ghat to me nearly\r\nall night, and told him to report on his return to Ghat:--\"The Christian\r\nwished to give Ouweek a handsome present, but the Ghadamsee people, who\r\nare sorry dogs, would not let the Christian act from the impulse of his\r\nheart. So Ouweek quarrelled with the people of the caravan.\" The Sheikh\r\nand his followers kept up a roasting fire all night, a stone's throw from\r\nmy encampment. The bandit was merry at the expense of the alarms of me\r\nand our people, telling my messenger, \"These Ghadamseeah are all dogs,\r\nbut the Christian is no dog, for when I threatened to cut his throat, he\r\nsat down quietly and ate dates and biscuits.\" The bandit gave me more\r\ncredit than I can take to myself, for, at the time of munching the\r\nbiscuits, I was not aware of his violent attempt at levying black mail.\r\nThere can, however, be no question of the bad character of this Sheikh.\r\nHe has murdered several people, and, not long ago, killed a rich\r\nMarabout, going on a pilgrimage to Mecca, plundering him of a great deal\r\nof property. He is therefore no pleasant customer for a Christian to meet\r\nwith on the highways of The Sahara, whom he would decapitate with less\r\nscruple of conscience than a Leadenhall poulterer would cut off a goose's\r\nhead. He has many people, though a second-rate chief, and is allied by\r\nblood to the reigning family of Shafou. Though a little insignificant\r\nman, he possesses undaunted courage, and has signalized himself in the\r\nwars against the Shânbah. He walks lame with a wound he has received in\r\nbattle. He is generally dreaded in the open country, except by the\r\nmerchants, who are personally acquainted with him, to whom he behaves as\r\na very jolly fellow.\r\n\r\n_14th._--All our people rose early, and got off as quickly as possible.\r\nWe could not breathe freely until we were out of the clutches of Ouweek.\r\nSome of them, however, paid a farewell visit to the Sheikh, who received\r\nthem very graciously, as politely as any Spanish bandit, and sent this\r\nmessage to me:--\"Yâkob, go in _amen_ (peace or security) to Ghat, fear\r\nnothing from any one, for you are under my protection.\" Our people\r\nencouraged me along. The Souf Arab, who was so cowardly, said:--\"Why\r\ndidn't you say, 'Mahomet is the prophet of God,' then you would have had\r\nto pay no money.\" I called him a fool, and asked him, if all the people\r\ndidn't pay something as well as myself? This stopped his mouth. Zaleâ\r\nfully agreed with me, as did all our people, that if Ouweek had simply\r\nasked for a present, he would have got more from me. I certainly should\r\nhave given him at once half a dozen dollars if he had shown himself\r\nfriendly, and welcomed me to his district as a friendly stranger. It\r\nappears he refused money, and even the camel, which the people in the\r\n_imbroglio_ said he might, if he choose, take; he took the woollens,\r\nbecause he knew they would not be made a question of restitution by the\r\nSheikhs and Sultan. He was clearly entitled to receive something from me,\r\nby the usage of ages, commonly called \"safety-money,\" but not to demand\r\nit at the point of his broad-sword. This was his great offence in the\r\neyes of all his friends and the authorities of Ghat.\r\n\r\nI did not see the well, but the water of Tadoghseen is extremely sweet\r\nand palatable. I should have paid my homage to this well, as I had done\r\nto all the sources of water in The Desert, had not Ouweek taken up his\r\nquarters near it, and I was not anxious to disturb or excite the\r\ncuriosity of the bandit by a personal interview. One of his followers\r\ncame to see me off in the morning, a tall attenuated black shape of a\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWe are now fairly in \"the region of the Genii,\" the land of mystery and\r\ndisembodied spirits; and the whole country is intersected and bounded on\r\nevery side with the battlemental ranges of black, gloomy, and\r\nfantastically-shaped mountains, distinguishing the country of the Ghat\r\nTouaricks, where their friends and confederates, the Jenoun or Genii,\r\ndwell with them in the most harmonious friendship. Here our people say,\r\n\r\n    \"Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth\r\n     Unseen, both when we wake and when we sleep.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere exists a compact between the Genii and Touaricks to this\r\neffect, a species of _Magna Charta_, and not selling themselves to\r\nthe Saharan devils:--\"The Touarick fathers solemnly vowed, alone of\r\nmortals, eternal friendship to the Genii, they would never molest\r\nthem in the various palaces which they (the Genii) had built in\r\ntheir (the Touarick) country, nor use any means either through\r\nMahomet, or the Holy Koran, to injure them or dislodge them from the\r\nblack turret-shaped hills: and for this devotion on their part, the\r\nGenii promised to afford them (the Touaricks) protection at all\r\ntimes against their enemies, more particularly during the night,\r\ngiving them vision and tact to surprise their enemy during the dread\r\nhour of darkness.\" So the Touaricks are reckoned very devils at\r\nnight, and usually attack their enemy at this time, and hack him to\r\npieces with their broadswords. Poor Major Laing was surprised by a\r\nTouarghee chief in this way, two of his servants were killed, and\r\nhimself wounded, or cut and hacked in some thirty places. The air of\r\nthe region of Genii and Touaricks we now breathed, but found it as\r\nfree as that of any part of The Sahara. Our people did not think so,\r\nand they pointed out to me with a shuddering awe all the mysterious\r\nobjects. First and foremost, standing out from the lower and more\r\nmodest abodes of the Genii, like a huge castle, such as the Titans\r\nmight have built when they scaled the walls of heaven, was the _Kesar\r\nGenoun_, (‮قصر جنون‬) \"Palace of demons,\" _par excellence_.\r\nThis was the hall of council where the Genii meet from thousands of\r\nmiles round, and debate upon their affairs of State. It is also the\r\nJemâ or Mosque, where they meet on a Friday to pray to Allah, for\r\nthey also worship Allah, though not properly. These lower and less\r\ndestructive grades of Demonii \"believe and tremble.\" This is also\r\nthe mint where the Genii keep their bullion. The entire caverns of\r\nthis monstrous block of rock are full of gold and silver, and\r\ndiamonds, and all precious jewels[68]. A more _mortal_ and sublunary\r\nmystery was now pointed out to me. This was a small block of rock\r\nabout fifty feet high, of the shape of the accompanying drawing; the\r\nlower or under part where it comes in contact with the ground, being\r\nso exceedingly small as not to be visible. Here was the dreadful\r\nspot on which several people were murdered, and amongst the rest a\r\nwealthy Marabout, but a saint of great sanctity. The murderer (of\r\nwhat country it is not said), was so ashamed and horrified at his\r\nown deed of blood, that when he had committed it he begged the Genii\r\nto cover up their bodies from his sight, for he had not courage to\r\nbury them. The Genii listened to his request, detached this piece of\r\nrock from their great palace, where it has rested, occasionally\r\n_rocking_[69], say the people, to this day--a memento against murder\r\nand crime! For this service the murderer begged the Genii to accept\r\nof some of the spoil, but they refused to accept of gold tainted\r\nwith blood; and, on the contrary, the avenging spirits of justice\r\npelted him with pieces of rock till he died. He was fairly stoned to\r\ndeath, and his bruised and broken carcase was left unburied, a\r\nhorror to all passers-by! We see the Genii are a moral people, and\r\nin general the Mussulmans of The Sahara speak of them as a good sort\r\nof folks, not unlike Puck and his merry crew, only playing\r\noccasionally mischievous pranks upon silly inconsiderate mortals.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Kesar Jenoun stretches away north and south the long range of\r\nblack basaltic mountains, called by our people Wareerat, but I am not\r\nsure if this be the Touarick name. This ridge forms the boundaries of the\r\nTibboo and Touarick country, for it stretches as far or farther south\r\nthan the Tibboos, some fifteen or twenty days' journey. From the town of\r\nGhat to the base of this range is half a day, eastward, although the\r\nrange looks, by the ordinary delusion of Desert optics, to be close upon\r\nthe town.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] \"Slow and sure,\" has in no case whatever so good an\r\n    application as to the progress of the camel's march.\r\n\r\n[65] These were evidently Ouweek's spies. They certainly did not\r\n    accost me in that frank manner as the Touaricks had been wont in\r\n    Ghadames.\r\n\r\n[66] \"Without my permission,\" or literally \"tearing the _Litham_ from my\r\n    face.\" _El-Lithām_--‮اللثام‬--is the bandage which all\r\n    the Touaricks wear around the face, covering every part of it\r\n    except the top of the cheek-bones and the eyes.\r\n\r\n[67] The houlee, ‮حولي‬, is the same as the heik, and the\r\n    _jibbah_, ‮جبّه‬, is a huge frock or tobe, with short sleeves,\r\n    and coming up close round the neck.\r\n\r\n[68] On these words of Shakespear, \"_Kept by a Devil_,\" (King\r\n    Henry VI., Part II., Act 4, and Scene 3,) Steevens makes the\r\n    following annotation:--\"It was anciently supposed, and is still a\r\n    vulgar superstition of the East, that mines, containing precious\r\n    metals, were guarded by evil spirits.\" So in _Certaine Secrete\r\n    Wonders of Nature_, by Edward Fenton, 1569, \"There appeare at this\r\n    day many strange visions and wicked spirites in the metal mines of\r\n    the Greate Turke. In the mine at Anneburg was a metal sprite which\r\n    killed twelve workmen; the same causing the rest to forsake the\r\n    myne, albeit it was very riche.\"\r\n\r\n[69] There is an extraordinary co-resemblance between this Saharan\r\n    _rocking_, or _logging_, stone, and that of our own in Cornwall,\r\n    much noted and visited by all classes of travellers. Among the\r\n    truly romantic coast-scenery of Cornwall, at the south-west angle\r\n    of the county, are the celebrated Logan, or _rocking-stone_, and\r\n    the lofty granite rocks called _Tiergh Castle_. Here is a reef of\r\n    rocks jutting into the sea, on the summit of one of which is a\r\n    large single mass of stone, weighing about sixty tons, resting on\r\n    a sort of pivot, so near the centre that the whole block may be\r\n    easily made to oscillate or _log_, to and fro. This _logging_\r\n    stone has created astonishment amongst the illiterate, and given\r\n    rise to many fabulous stories: whilst others have imagined it was\r\n    placed here by the Druids, to overawe and terrify the vulgar.\r\n\r\n    Geologists, however, says Dr. Paris, readily discover, that the\r\n    only chisel ever employed has been the tooth of time--the only\r\n    artists engaged, the elements. Some years ago, the upper, or\r\n    logging-stone, was thrown from its equilibrium by the bodily\r\n    exertions of some sailors; but a general cry of indignation having\r\n    been raised against this wanton act, it was shortly afterwards\r\n    reinstated in nearly its original position by the perpetrators of\r\n    the mischief, who, while thus making honourable amends for their\r\n    former folly, evinced great ingenuity and skilfulness.--_Fisher's\r\n    Views in Devonshire and Cornwall._\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL.

About ten A.M., the palms of Ghat were visible through\r\nthe scattered blocks of rock in the valley, for the plain became now\r\ncontracted and assumed the shape of a deep broad valley, on the one side\r\na low range of sand-hills, and on the other the high rocky chain of\r\nWareerat. But the first sight of the oasis, after nineteen weary days of\r\nDesert, affected me with only disagreeable sensations. The affair of\r\nOuweek, though pretty well got over, had shaken my confidence in the\r\nTouaricks. Indeed, the painful forebodings of the last forty hours had\r\nseriously deranged my plans, and made me think of returning, availing\r\nmyself the most of my unsuccessful tour. This suffering of thought day\r\nafter day is intense and worries me, and will soon make me an old man, if\r\nnot in years. It was the sudden shock of the affair just after receiving\r\nthe messenger of peace from Ghat. I saw at once that there was a great\r\ndeal of insubordination in the lesser chieftains, which made travelling\r\nin this country very insecure. I remembered the remark of my taleb, \"All\r\nthe Touaricks are the Divan, and each has his own opinion, and carries it\r\nout in spite of the Sultan.\"\r\n\r\nWe were now met by the friends of the Ghadamsee merchants, but with the\r\nexception of Essnousee and two or three others, I received few salutes of\r\nwelcome; and when we got up to the gates of the city (at noon), not a\r\nsingle person of our caravan offered me the least assistance, either in\r\ninterpreting or otherwise. I felt myself in a most deplorable\r\npredicament, but I reflected that all men must each one look after his\r\nown business, so our people were now each one occupied with his own\r\naffairs. I felt much the want of a good Moorish or Arab servant. Said was\r\nof no use whatever in this case. Strangers and loungers crowded and\r\nclamoured round me, anxious to look at the face of \"The Christian.\" It\r\nwas covered with my travelling handkerchief, and when I untied my face to\r\ngratify their curiosity, they burst out with the rude and wild expression\r\nof surprise, \"_Whooh! Whooh! Whey!_\" Amongst this mob I at once\r\ndistinguished a number of the Aheer and Soudan merchants. These showed\r\nthe greatest curiosity, but my outer dress being entirely Moorish, there\r\nwas little novelty in my appearance, nay, scarcely any to point me out\r\nfrom the rest of the caravan. Several of the Ghat people then asked me\r\nwhat I wanted. I told them, the Governor of Ghat. I was not understood.\r\nAt last came up to me a young Tripoline Moor of the name of Mustapha, who\r\nvolunteered his services as Touarghee and Arabic interpreter, but, of\r\ncourse, our conversation was always in Arabic. Amidst a cluster of\r\nTouaricks and Ghat townsmen, the Governor was pointed out. Several\r\nSheikhs were present, but it appears they gave precedence to the\r\nGovernor's son from a feeling of shamefacedness. Haj Ahmed's son is a\r\nvery nice polite young gentleman, as smart as a Parisian dandy. After a\r\nlittle delay he conducted us to a house, in which some of his father's\r\nslaves were living. It was a dark dreadful dilapidated hovel. The young\r\ngentleman most earnestly apologized, protesting, \"The town is full of\r\npeople, merchants, and strangers. We have nothing better left in the\r\ntown. Perhaps you will come and live in our house out of the town.\" We\r\nlooked out our baggage, which had been conveyed for us by Arabs of our\r\ncaravan, and were astonished to find it scattered about outside the city\r\ngates, the caravan people having thrown it down there. However, nothing\r\nwas lost, and this at once impressed me with the remarkable honesty of\r\nthe Ghatee people. I took up my quarters in a small room built on the\r\nterrace, without window or door, but very airy. A roof of mud and straw\r\nwas now a luxurious and splendid mansion to me. At least a dozen slaves\r\nwere occupied in carrying my baggage from outside the gates to my\r\ndomicile, each carrying some trifle. No camels or beast of burden are\r\nallowed to enter the city gates, all goods and merchandize are carried by\r\nslaves in and out. Like the porters at the different traveller-stations\r\nin Europe, each of these slaves seized hold of the merest trifle of\r\nbaggage, a stick or a bit of cord, in order to make an exorbitant demand\r\nof the value of a shilling. The Desert furnishes a parallel for every\r\ncircumstance of civilized life.\r\n\r\nThe last night or two I had found it very cold, and the wind too high for\r\ntents. I may observe here, conveniently, the cold was so great in this\r\nportion of Sahara, that I never could undress myself for dread of the\r\ncold. After loosening my neckcloth and shoes, I lay down in the dress\r\nwhich I wore during the day. My bed was a simple mattress laid over a\r\npiece of matting, which latter was spread on the hard earth or sands of\r\nThe Desert, as it might be, with a small sofa cushion for a pillow. After\r\nI had laid down the mattress, I then covered myself up with a large\r\nwoollen barracan or blanket, very thick and heavy, and over this was also\r\ndrawn a dark-blue European cloak. The cloth distinguished my bed from\r\nthose of the merchants, and the nagah always knew the encampment by the\r\nsight of this Christian garment. When I wore it in the day she was\r\nimmediately sensible of the presence of her master. I did not pitch a\r\ntent, for we could not, but formed a sort of head-place of the two\r\npanniers of the camel, over which we arranged camel's gear, forming a\r\nsmall top. Under this I placed or poked my head, so that, at night, if\r\nturning over my face, I found a little shelter from the naked cold\r\nheavens. In this way I lay enveloped in a mass of clothing. I usually\r\nwaked a couple of hours before daybreak with the intensity of the cold.\r\nSaid slept closely by me on a lion's skin, and rolled himself up in the\r\nslight canvass of the tent. Like myself he never undressed himself at\r\nnight. When he wished to confer a favour upon any of his negro\r\ncountrymen, or the poor slaves, he would take them and roll them up with\r\nhim in this canvass. He would have sometimes half a dozen at once with\r\nhim, the confined air of their united breathings keeping them mutually\r\nwarm. The poor Arab camel-drivers had nothing but their barracans which\r\nthey wore in the day to cover themselves up at night, whilst the bare\r\nearth was their couch of down, and a heap of stones their luxurious\r\npillow. All these Arabs were wandering wayfaring Jacobs of The Desert.\r\nEl-Aïshi says, speaking of the bleak wind of The Desert, \"The north wind\r\nblows in these places with an intensity equalling the cold of hell;\r\nlanguage fails me to express this rigorous temperature.\" The Mohammedans\r\nbelieve that the extremes of heat and cold meet in hell. Some have\r\nthought there is an allusion to this in the words, \"Weeping and wailing\r\nand gnashing of teeth,\" (the teeth chattering from cold.) Milton has also\r\nenumerated cold as one of the torments of the lost. The tormented spirits\r\npassed--\r\n\r\n    \"O'er many a frozen, many a fiery, Alp.\"\r\n\r\nI had not been many minutes in my new apartment before the Governor\r\nhimself came in. I had been addressing the young Ghatee as the Governor\r\nhimself, like Goldsmith harangued a duke's footman for the duke himself.\r\nHaj Ahmed, his father, welcomed me with every demonstration of\r\nhospitality. He sat chatting with me until the arrival of the Sheikh\r\nJabour, who also welcomed me in the most friendly manner. This was the\r\nSheikh who had dispatched his slave to the well of Tadoghseen to meet me.\r\nTwo or three other Touaricks of distinction came in with my friend\r\nEssnousee. They then questioned me upon the conduct of Ouweek, the news\r\nof which had now spread over all the town, and thanking Jabour for\r\nsending his slave, he replied, smiling, \"Ouweek was joking with you.\" And\r\nthen all joined in a laugh about Ouweek's affair. Jabour, ashamed of the\r\nbusiness, took this method of easing my mind. The Governor now began to\r\nask me about news and politics, and how Muley Abd Errahman was getting on\r\nwith the French. The burning of the French steamer on the coast of\r\nMorocco after she grounded, had been transformed by The Desert reports\r\ninto a victory over the French, in which the French had lost 70,000 men\r\nand several ships. The Governor had also heard the Maroquine war had\r\nrecommenced. I excused my ignorance by saying, I had been a long time in\r\nGhadames, and had heard nothing. Odd enough, the Governor asked me,\r\n\"Which was the oldest dynasty in Europe?\" I told him the Bourbons of\r\nFrance. The Sheikh Jabour here interposed that his family was more than\r\nthree thousand years old! The pride of an hereditary _noblesse_ is\r\ndeeply rooted in these Touarghee chiefs. The lore of ancestral\r\ndistinction is co-extensive with the human race. I have given but the\r\nsubstance of our conversations. I give some of it in detail:--\r\n\r\n\r\nInterrogation, _by the Governor_.\r\n\r\n_His Excellency._--\"What did Ouweek to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was saucy to me.\"\r\n\r\n_His Excellency._--\"Have you seen lately Muley Abd Errahman (Emperor of\r\nMorocco)?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n_His Excellency._--\"He has conquered the French, destroyed their ships.\r\nThey have lost 70,000 men. If you had told Muley Abd Errahman you had\r\nbeen coming here, he would have sent me a letter by you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of it.\"\r\n\r\n_His Excellency._--\"How is your Sultan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, thank you?\"\r\n\r\n_His Excellency._--\"When did you last see Sidi Abd-el-Kader?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very lately.\"\r\n\r\n_His Excellency._--\"He is a prophet.\" (To which I said, Amen.)\r\n\r\n\r\nInterrogatory, _by Sheikh Jabour_.\r\n\r\n_The Sheikh._--\"What did Ouweek to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was very rude.\"\r\n\r\n_The Sheikh._--\"Ouweek was playing with you, trying to frighten you\r\nbecause you are a stranger. He's a fool himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's no matter now.\"\r\n\r\n_The Sheikh._--\"How's your Sultan? Does he doubt we shall utterly destroy\r\nthe Shânbah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not the least.\"\r\n\r\n_The Sheikh_ (in reply to the Governor).--\"My fathers were princes before\r\nall the Christian kings, thousands of years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say they were.\"\r\n\r\nMy visitors now took leave of me, Jabour shaking hands with me, and\r\nsaying, _Mā-tăhāfsh_, \"don't fear.\" Afterwards had a great many curious\r\nvisitors of the lower classes, all raving mad to see the _Roumee_\r\n(\"Christian\"). And amongst the rest, the son of Ouweek! who is a young\r\nharmless fellow, and said his father would never hurt a great Christian\r\nlike me. He begged hard for a piece of sugar, which I gave him. He asked\r\nme if his father was coming to Ghat. For supper I received a splendid\r\ndish of meat and sopped bread, but very highly seasoned with pepper and\r\ncloves. It is the Soudan pepper, a small quantity of which possesses the\r\nmost violent, nay virulent strength.\r\n\r\n_16th._--After taking a walk in the morning, I returned the visit of\r\nthe Governor. He received me very politely, and presented me with a\r\nlion's skin, brought from Soudan. His Excellency shewed me his\r\ncertificate of character and rank, certified by a huge seal of the\r\nEmperor of Morocco. He pointed out with conscious pride the name of\r\nMarabout, with which sacred title the Emperor had dubbed him. Muley\r\nAbd Errahman is an immense favourite here amongst the Moorish\r\ntownsmen. They call him their Sultan. The Turks they fear and\r\ndetest. They expect them one day at Ghat. In the afternoon I sent\r\nthe Governor, according to the advice of Mustapha, two loaves of\r\nsugar (French), a pound of cloves, and a pound of sunbul[70].\r\nCloves--_grunfel_, ‮قرنفل‬--are greatly esteemed, especially by\r\nthe women, who season their cakes, cuskasous, and made-dishes with them.\r\nThe sunbul (leaves) is made into a decoction, or wash, and is used\r\nby fashionable ladies in Sahara as eau de Cologne in Europe.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I paid a visit to Sheikh Jabour. The Sheikh has a house within\r\nthe town, which very few of the Sheikhs have. Jabour received me\r\nfriendly. I could not see the features of the Sheikh very well, on\r\naccount of his litham. Jabour, however, is a perfect aristocrat in his\r\nway, with a very delicate hand. He is tall and well-made, and his simple\r\nand elegant manners denote at once \"The Marabout Sheikh of the\r\nTouaricks,\" of the most ancient and renowned of Touarghee families. I\r\ntook the Sheikh a present of a loaf of sugar, three pounds of cloves and\r\nsunbul, and a shasheeah, or fez. Jabour received them very graciously,\r\nand repeated his _ma-tahafsh_, \"don't fear,\" several times, promising me,\r\nat the same time, to use his influence with his friends to get me safely\r\nescorted to Aheer and Soudan. The Sheikh's followers and other\r\ndistinguished Touaricks repeat the same, but the Governor I find more\r\ncautious in his speech. On my return home, the Sheikh sent to know if the\r\nhandkerchief, in which the present was wrapped, were also a present, and\r\nwhether the bearer of the present had purloined it, for he had taken it\r\naway with him. I immediately sent the Sheikh back the handkerchief,\r\ninforming the Sheikh the bearer was not told to leave it. All Saharan\r\npeople are immoderately fond of a handkerchief. I recommend travellers in\r\nSahara to supply themselves with a good stock of very cheap coloured\r\ncotton handkerchiefs. My house is thronged all day long with visitors. I\r\nam obliged to exhibit myself to the people like the Fat Boy, or the\r\nAmerican Giant. It is Richardson's Show at Ghat instead of Greenwich. The\r\nrest of the ghafalah, which we left behind, arrived to-day. My friend,\r\nEl-Besher, to my regret, had turned suddenly back and gone to Touat,\r\nwhere his brother had arrived from Timbuctoo. It is reported that a\r\nquarrel had taken place about his brother amongst the Timbuctoo caravan,\r\nin which affair ten people had been killed. So all Saharan caravans do\r\nnot travel in such harmony as we did. The Ghadamsee caravans are\r\ncertainly the most pacific. But the Timbuctoo people have everywhere a\r\nbad character.\r\n\r\n_17th._--In the morning went to see the Consul of the Europeans, as the\r\nMoors call him. This is the Sheikh Hateetah, of whom very honourable\r\nmention is made by the Denham and Clapperton party. Hateetah himself\r\nassumes the distinction of \"Friend,\" or Consul of the English. I found\r\nhim stretched on a pallet upon the ground floor, extremely unwell with\r\nfever, and surrounded by his friends. He has just come from the country\r\ndistricts. He asked me, \"Is the Consul well? Are his daughters well? Is\r\nthe King of England well?\" Hateetah had some years ago visited the Consul\r\nand his family at Tripoli, under British protection, for Touaricks dare\r\nnot approach Tripoli. He has in his possession, after a dozen years, a\r\nfine scarlet burnouse and coat, braided with gold lace, and also a gun,\r\nwhich were presented to him by Colonel Warrington, on the part of our\r\nGovernment, for his services to our Bornou expedition. The Sheikh told me\r\nhe had besides a written certificate from the Consul, but it was in the\r\ncountry. I am the first person whom he has had an opportunity of serving\r\nsince his return from Tripoli, where he formally engaged, on the part of\r\nthe Touaricks, to give British subjects all necessary protection in the\r\nGhat districts. For this reason he is styled, \"The friend of the\r\nEnglish.\" All strangers here are placed under the care of one Sheikh or\r\nanother, to whom they make presents, but not to the rest. Hateetah\r\nresides in the suburbs.\r\n\r\nDuring the past night was taken dreadfully ill, in the stomach, by eating\r\nthe high-seasoned dishes of the Governor. After drinking olive-oil and\r\nvomiting, found myself much better. People say oil is the best remedy in\r\nsuch cases. The Governor was troubled at my illness, and sent to ask\r\nwhether he should send me some senna tea. Wrote to-day to Mr. Alsager and\r\nColonel Warrington. The letters were to have been dispatched direct to\r\nTripoli, but the Touaricks would neither allow one of their own people\r\nnor an Arab courier to go, giving as the reason that Shafou, the Sultan,\r\nwas not arrived. Touaricks have a horror of Turks, and cannot bear to\r\nhave communication with them, and do everything in their power to prevent\r\nothers from communicating with Tripoli. Not acquainted with Mediterranean\r\npolitics, they imagine that, because the Turks have retaken possession of\r\nGhadames and Fezzan, so long quasi-independent of Tripoli, they must\r\nnecessarily invade the Touarick territory, and seize upon their wee town\r\nof Ghat, but to them the metropolis of The Sahara. This evening Jabour\r\nhinted, in Hibernian style, to one of the slaves waiting upon me, that\r\nhis present of sugar was rather small. I forthwith sent him two loaves\r\nmore, which rejoiced him so much that he exclaimed, \"Thank the Christian\r\nby G--d. Tell him he has nothing to fear in Ghat, and he shall go safe to\r\nSoudan.\" Felt better to-night. The Governor sent his last dish this\r\nevening. A stranger of distinction is supplied with food for three days.\r\nI have had my share of honour and hospitality, and am glad of it. I shall\r\nnow be cautious what I eat. But I find everything is exceedingly dear,\r\nthe number of strangers, foreign merchants, and slaves, is so unusually\r\ngreat as quickly to devour all the food brought here.\r\n\r\nYesterday I made the acquaintance of Haj Ibrahim, a Moorish merchant\r\nresident in Tripoli, but a native of Jerbah. When in Tripoli he acts as\r\nConsul for the Ghadamsee merchants; his brother is now in charge.\r\nMustapha came with him direct from Tripoli, not passing through Mourzuk,\r\nbut _viâ_ the oases of Fezzan to the west. So an European agent\r\nestablished at Mourzuk, cannot well collect a statistical account of\r\ntrade, on account of few Ghat caravans travelling the Mourzuk route. Haj\r\nIbrahim promises to be useful to me, and has already sent a letter for me\r\nto Ghadames. This merchant has brought the largest amount of goods to the\r\nSouk, about forty camels. The whole of the Soudan ghafalah has not yet\r\narrived from Aheer. It comes in by small detached parties. As there is\r\nnothing to fear on the road, people prefer travelling in small\r\ncompanies, which facilitates their march, not being detained at the\r\nwells waiting for the running of the water.\r\n\r\nI have _cut_ in a certain way my old friends of the Ghadamsee ghafalah.\r\nThis has done them good, for they now begin to return to me, and are\r\npolite. Before they were all so frightened at the Touaricks, that I knew\r\nif I did not cut them, they would cut me. Now, when seeing the Touaricks\r\nare friendly, they are also friendly;--such is the world of Sahara, as\r\nwell as the world of Paris or London. When a man has few friends he gets\r\nless, when many he gets more. On the principle, I suppose, that money\r\ngets money, and friendship friendship. The Moors of the coast, of whom\r\nthere are a few here, exhibit more courage, and a bolder front to the\r\nTouaricks. The worst of this place is, _The Rabble_. It is the veritable\r\nCaboul, or Canton _Rabble_. Here's my \"great difficulty.\" They run after\r\nme, and even hoot me in the streets. Were it not for this rabble, I could\r\nwalk about with the greatest freedom and safety, and alone.\r\n\r\n_18th._--Went to see Haj Ibrahim. Sent the letter to Mr. Alsager _viâ_\r\nGhadames, the only letter I wrote from Ghat during the fifty days of my\r\nresidence here. In my absence a loaf of sugar was stolen out of my\r\napartment. Suspicion falls upon a Fezzanee, whom I have employed, and to\r\nwhom I gave this very morning a quarter of a dollar. These small loaves\r\nof French beet-root sugar sell for two-thirds of a dollar in Ghat. Ouweek\r\narrived to-day from his district, after stopping for the rest of the\r\ncaravan to get what he could in the way of begging by force. This is the\r\ncunning of the old fox bandit. He knows he can beg more effectually from\r\nthe merchant and trader in the open desert, than at Ghat, where people\r\nmay refuse, and do refuse to satisfy his importunities. I have done so\r\nwith the rest. He now pretends he was only playing with me, and that he\r\nwould have let me pass through his district though I had given him\r\nnothing. Can we believe him? Jabour says in turn:--\"I will make Ouweek\r\nrestore the goods which he has extorted by violence from the Christian.\"\r\nThere is no doubt Shafou will reprimand the bandit when he arrives. But I\r\ndo not ask or expect the restoration of such a few trifling things. In\r\nthis country, as the Governor says, \"full of Sheiks,\" where authority is\r\nso divided, and the Sultan's power is so feeble, we must expect this sort\r\nof freebooting extortion. Such were the good and fine old days of\r\nchivalry in France and England, so much regretted by certain morbid\r\nromancers, Sir Walter Scott to boot, when a baron made a foray upon a\r\nneighbouring baron's people, and shut himself up with the booty in his\r\ncastle, defying equally his plundered neighbour and his sovereign. But if\r\nin the comparison there is any declination of the balance, it is in\r\nfavour of the Touaricks, for these Sheikhs, governing their respective\r\ndistricts with a _quasi_-independent authority, are now living in\r\nprofound peace and harmony with one another.\r\n\r\nHad a visit from some score of Touarick women, of all complexions,\r\ntempers, and ages. After staring at me for some time with amazed\r\ncuriosity and silence, they became restless. Not knowing what to do with\r\nthem, I took out a loaf of white sugar, cut it into pieces, and then\r\ndistributed it amongst them. The scene now suddenly changed, joy beamed\r\nin every eye, and every one let her tongue run most volubly. They asked\r\nme, \"Whether I was married--whether the Christian women were\r\npretty--whether prettier than they--and whether, if not married, I should\r\nhave any objection to marry one of them?\" To all which questions I\r\nanswered in due categorical form:--\"I was not married--the Christian\r\nwomen were pretty, but they, the Touarick women, were prettier than\r\nChristian women--and, lastly, I should see whether I would marry one of\r\nthem when I came from Soudan.\" These answers were perfectly satisfactory.\r\nBut then came a puzzler. They asked me, \"Which was the prettiest amongst\r\nthem?\" I looked at one, and then at another, with great seriousness,\r\nassuming very ungallant airs, (the women the meanwhile giggling and\r\ncoquetting, and some throwing back their barracans, shawls I may call\r\nthem, farther from their shoulders, baring their bosoms in true ball-room\r\nstyle,) and, at last, falling back, and shutting my eyes, placing my left\r\nhand to my forehead, as if in profound reflection, I exclaimed languidly,\r\nand with a forced sigh, \"Ah, I can't tell, you are all so pretty!\" This\r\ncreated an explosion of mirth, some of the more knowing ones intimating\r\nby their looks, \"It's lucky for you that you have got out of the scrape.\"\r\nBut an old lady, close by me, was very angry with me;--\"You fool,\r\nChristian, take one of the young ones; here's my daughter.\" It is\r\nnecessary to explain, that the woman of the Touaricks is not the woman of\r\nthe Moors and Mussulmans generally. She has here great liberty, walks\r\nabout unveiled, and takes an active part in all affairs and transactions\r\nof life. Dr. Oudney justly remarks, \"The liveliness of the women, their\r\nfreeness with the men, and the marked attention the latter paid them,\r\nformed a striking contrast with other Mohammedan States.\" Batouta\r\nmentions a Berber tribe of Western Sahara, as having similar manners. He\r\nsays:--\"This people has very singular manners. So the men are not at all\r\njealous of their women. The women are not at all embarrassed in the\r\npresence of the men; and though they, the women, are very assiduous at\r\ntheir prayers, they appear always uncovered.\" He adds, that certain\r\nwomen, of free manners, are shared amongst the people without exciting\r\nthe feelings of jealousy amongst the men. It is the same with the\r\nTouaricks, but it is the absence of this Mussulman, or _oriental_\r\njealousy, of husbands of their wives, which distinguishes the Touaricks\r\nfrom other Mahometans of North Africa, and connects the social condition\r\nof the Touaricks more with European society. On departing, I gave the\r\nTouarick ladies some pins, and they, not knowing how to use them, (for\r\npins are never imported into The Desert, though needles in thousands,) I\r\ntaught them a good practical lesson by pinning two of them together by\r\ntheir petticoats, which liberty, on my part, I need not tell the reader,\r\nincreased the mirth of this merry meeting of Touarghee ladies\r\nprodigiously. I certainly felt glad that we could travel in a country and\r\nlaugh and chat with, and _look at_ the women without exciting the\r\nintolerable jealousy of the men. I think there is not a more dastardly\r\nbeing than a jealous husband. Amongst the Moors a traveller does not know\r\nwhether he can venture to speak to a man's wife or not, or whether he can\r\nmake her the most trifling present in return for the supper which she may\r\ncook.\r\n\r\nAfterwards had a very different visit of four Arabs, who came with the\r\nevident intention of getting something out of me by main force. I\r\nresisted to the last, and to their astonishment. I told them, all my\r\npresents were now for the Touaricks, and if they did not leave the house\r\nI would get them bastinadoed on their return to The Mountains. The worst\r\nclass of people which I have met with, since I left Tripoli, are _some_\r\nof these Arabs, who are the most dogged brazen-faced beggars and\r\nspongers, banditti in the open day. Yesterday arrived the powerful Aheer\r\ncamel-driver and conducteur Kandarka Bou Ahmed, the _Kylouwee_, whose\r\narrival produced a sensation. Some call him a Sheikh. He usually conducts\r\nthe Ghadamsee merchants between this and Aheer, and as far as Kanou. It\r\nis an established custom or law, in The Desert, that the people of each\r\ndistrict or country shall enjoy the privilege of conducting the caravans.\r\nThe Touaricks of Ghat conduct the merchants from Ghadames to Ghat, and\r\nthe Touaricks of Aheer the merchants from Ghat to Aheer, and so of the\r\nrest of the route, as far as Kanou, the final destination of the Soudan\r\ncaravan.\r\n\r\nMy Ghadamsee friend Bel Kasem came up to me today, and whispered in my\r\near the question, \"If slaves would be allowed to be sold now in the\r\nmarket of Tripoli?\" I answered frankly in the affirmative, but added, \"I\r\ndid not think it would last much longer.\" All the merchants now look upon\r\nme as an anti-slavery agent. The affair of Silva and Levi, if it\r\nprejudice the people against me on one side, gives me some consequence on\r\nthe other, on account of the steps which the British Consul took against\r\nthose merchants, or caused them to take. I went to see Bel Kasem in the\r\nevening, who is but a mere trader. He gave me this account of his\r\nslave-dealing:--\"I have purchased five slaves at forty mahboubs each. At\r\nTripoli I shall sell them at sixty. The Pasha takes ten duty, and I have\r\nonly ten for profit and the expenses, of conveying the slaves from Ghat\r\nto Tripoli, feeding them as well here as there. What, where is my\r\nprofit?\" I echoed, \"Where?\" This is a fair specimen of the market. He\r\ncomplains of the dearness of the slaves, although an unusual number, more\r\nthan a thousand, have been brought to the Souk or Mart. Haj Ibrahim and\r\nsome other large purchasers have greatly and unexpectedly increased the\r\ndemand. He says Haj Ibrahim purchases large quantities of goods on\r\ncredit, or for bills of six and nine months from European merchants in\r\nTripoli. These he exchanges against slaves in Ghat, and then returns and\r\nsells his slaves, and pays the bills as they come due. In this way, it\r\nwill be seen, the Desert slave-traffic is carried on upon the shoulders\r\nof European merchants. Haj Ibrahim considers his profits at twenty per\r\ncent. The people say he gets more. My friend, the Arab of Derge, called\r\nlate, to borrow five dollars of me. He said, \"I have purchased a slave\r\nfor twenty-five dollars; at present I have only twenty. You and I, Yâkob,\r\nhave been always friends. Lend me five dollars and I will pay you in a\r\nfew days. The slave is a little old but cheap, he is to work in the\r\ngardens at Ghadames.\" I then explained to him the law of England on\r\nslavery, which greatly surprised him. The next day this Derge Arab\r\nbrought in another fellow to ask me to lend him money to buy a slave,\r\njust to see whether I should make the same reply to him also.\r\n\r\n_19th._--Rose early, and better in health. I begin to feel at home in\r\nGhat, amidst the redoubtable Touaricks. I find them neither monsters nor\r\nmen-eaters[71]. Nevertheless, all the swaggering Arabs and Arab\r\ncamel-drivers are here very quiet and civil amongst their masters, the\r\nTouaricks. I frequently bully them now about their past boasting and\r\npresent cowardice. Two of the Arabs who had attempted to extort a present\r\nfrom me I met at Haj Ibrahim's house. I lectured them roundly, telling\r\nthem I would report them to the Pasha, for they were greater banditti\r\nthan the Touaricks. This had a salutary effect. I was not troubled\r\nafterwards with these brazen-faced begging Arabs.\r\n\r\nThis morning paid another visit to Haj Ahmed, the Governor. Found him\r\nvery friendly. He talked politics. I explained to him the circumstances\r\nof the war between France and Morocco, suppressing the most disagreeable\r\nparts for a Mahometan. In the course of conversation I was surprised to\r\nhear from Haj Ahmed, \"Now, since these twelve years, Tripoli belongs to\r\nthe English.\" I used vainly all my eloquence in Arabic to convince him of\r\nthis error, which has been propagated since the removal of Asker Ali from\r\nthe Pashalic of Tripoli at the instance of the British Consul. I then\r\nspoke to his Excellency of the necessity of sending some trifling\r\npresents to the Queen of England, as a sign of friendship, begging him to\r\nspeak to Shafou. He replied, \"The Touaricks have nothing but camels.\"\r\nThe Governor has a tremendous family. First of all, he has seven wives\r\nand concubines, then nine sons and six daughters. One of his female\r\nslaves repeated to me all their names, a complete muster-roll. When I\r\nvisited the Governor again, I congratulated him upon having so large a\r\nfamily. He observed smiling, with great self-complacency, \"Why, Yâkob, do\r\nyou call this a large family? What is a large family with you?\" I told\r\nhim eight and even six children was a large family. At this he affected\r\ngreat surprise, for he had heard that generally European females have\r\nthree or four children at a birth. Haj Ahmed is a man of about fifty,\r\nrather good-looking, stout and hard-working, but inclining to corpulency,\r\nvery unusual in The Desert. He is not very dark, and is of Arab\r\nextraction, and boasts that his family came from Mecca or Medina. He\r\npretends that his ancestors were amongst the warriors who besieged\r\nConstantinople, previous to its capture by the Turks. He is a native of\r\nTouat, but has been settled here twenty years, where he has built himself\r\na palace and planted large gardens. He is a shrewd and politic man, and\r\nhas, in a certain degree, those jealous feelings of Christians which are\r\npeculiar to the Moor. He dresses partly in the Moorish and partly in the\r\nTouarick style, indeed, like all the Moors of Ghat, who are called\r\nGhateen. He is, perhaps, not very learned, but is assisted by his nephew,\r\na young Shereef of great learning and amiable manners. I asked some of\r\nthe Ghatee people, who was their Sultan? They replied, \"Haj Ahmed; Shafou\r\nis not our Sultan.\" The Touaricks, however, have absolute control over\r\nall affairs, and Haj Ahmed stands in the same relation to Shafou, being\r\ngovernor of the town, as the Sheikh El-Mokhtar, who is governor of\r\nTimbuctoo, under the Sultan of Jinnee. But, Haj Ahmed, himself, disclaims\r\nall temporal authority, he repeatedly says in our conversation, \"I am not\r\nSheikh, or Kaëd, I'm only Marabout. All the people here are equal. When\r\nyou write to the Consul, tell him I'm only Marabout.\" The fact is, there\r\nare so many Sheikhs here that it is no honour to be a Sheikh. The honour\r\nis too cheap to be valued, and is as much repudiated as a French Cross of\r\nthe Legion of Honour. Haj Ahmed repudiates being a Sheikh most stoutly.\r\nNotwithstanding this repudiation, the Marabout is obliged to decide upon\r\nthe affairs of the city, even when Shafou is in town. The Marabout\r\npretends he does not receive presents like the Sheikhs, but he always\r\nreceived what I offered him, and which was more than what I gave to some\r\nof the Sheikhs. His palace stands west, two-thirds of a mile from the\r\ncity walls. Here he reigns supreme, priest and king, as Melchisedech of\r\npatriarchal times, surrounded with his numerous family of wives and\r\nconcubines, and about fifty male and female slaves. Some of the slaves\r\nlive in huts near his palace, or in the gardens. The Marabout is the\r\nlargest landed proprietor of Ghat, but he also trades a good deal, and is\r\nnow sending some of his children to Soudan to trade in slaves.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening Mohammed Kāfah sent me a bowl of sopped bread, fat, and\r\ngravy, garnished with two or three little pieces of meat. This is the\r\nfirst act and specimen of hospitality on the part of the townsmen. Kafah\r\nis a considerable merchant, and one of the three or four grandees of the\r\nplace. Bel Kasem called out to me to-day, for he lives next door, \"Yâkob!\r\nYâkob! Aye! for God's sake, one of my slaves is ill, bring me some\r\nmedicine to purge him, quick, quick, he'll die.\" I had nothing to give\r\nthe poor creature but a worm-powder, ordering half the quantity, all my\r\nmedicines being distributed, except those for the eyes. Undoubtedly many\r\nof the slaves must die before they arrive in Tripoli. They are mostly fed\r\non dates, the profit of the commerce is so small as not to allow\r\nwholesome food being given them. The slaves are brought from countries\r\nteeming with plenty of meat, grain, and vegetables, whilst they are fed\r\nwith herbage and dates _en route_ from Aheer to Ghat. What wonder then\r\nthey die?\r\n\r\nEvery body, as was the case at Ghadames, high and low, rich and poor,\r\nyoung and old, wishes to convert me into a good Mussulman, being\r\nmortified that so quiet a Christian should be an infidel. An old Sheikh\r\npaid me a visit to-day, and began, \"Now, Christian, that you have come\r\ninto this country, I hope you will find everything better than in your\r\nown country, and become a Mussulman, one loved of God. Come to my house,\r\nleave your infidel father and mother. I have two daughters. I will give\r\nyou both for wives, and seven camels besides. This will make you a Sheikh\r\namongst us. You can also be a Marabout, and spend your life in prayer.\" I\r\nexcused myself, by saying, \"I had engagements in my country. My Sultan\r\nwould brand me with disgrace, and I should be fetched out of this country\r\nby the Turks, who were always the friends of the English.\" The Sheikh\r\nsighed, raised up his aged body, and departed, mumbling something, a\r\nblessing or a curse, upon my head. A younger son of Haj Ahmed came in and\r\naddressed me, \"Why not say, 'There is one God', and 'Mahomet is the\r\nprophet of God?'\" I told him a Christian was prohibited from making such\r\na confession. On paying a visit to Mohammed Kafah, who sent me the\r\nsupper, I found his house full of slaves and Soudan goods, and he himself\r\nvery busy in the midst of them. He received me very friendly, and, after\r\na little, said, \"It would be better for you if you turned Mussulman. Do\r\nyou not wish to go to Paradise? A slave of ours is better than you, and\r\nyour estate.\" To turn the conversation, I observed (which I knew would\r\nexcite his mercantile lust, despite his orthodox zeal), \"I hear you are\r\nvastly rich, the richest merchant in Ghat.\" \"Ah!\" he replied, distending\r\ninto consequence, \"but the Christians have all the money.\" I rejoined,\r\n\"If there were a better Government in Tripoli, the Mussulmans would have\r\nmore money.\" Asking about the arrival of Shafou, he observed, \"Haj Ahmed\r\nis our Sultan. I'm not a Touarick. God help if I were a Touarick.\" He\r\nthen took me by the hands, and led me to the women's apartments to show\r\nme to his wife and daughters. The good wife, after handling my hands,\r\nwhich were a little whiter and cleaner than what are generally seen in\r\nThe Desert, for to have hands with a layer of dirt upon them of several\r\nmonths' collecting, is an ordinary circumstance,--exclaimed, \"Dear-a-me,\r\ndear-a-me, how wonderful, and this Christian doesn't know God!\" Her\r\nhusband shook his head negatively. The court-yard of his house was soon\r\nfilled and crammed with people, who rushed in from the streets, and the\r\nfriendly Ghatee was obliged to send me home quick, lest I should be\r\nsmothered by a mob of people. The affair of Silva and Levi had reached\r\nhim, and the report will soon get to Soudan and Timbuctoo, for the\r\nmerchants carry everything with them which interests their commerce,\r\nmaking additions as they go along. Here, as at Mogador, it was reported\r\nthat I was commissioned by the Sultan of England to buy up and liberate\r\nall the slaves. On returning home, I had another posse of visitors, and\r\nsome of Haj Ahmed's sons, who came with the fixed determination to\r\nconvert me. One said, on my admiring his Soudan coloured frock, \"If you\r\nwill become a Mussulman, I will give you one.\" I now felt myself obliged\r\nto rebut some of this impertinence, and answered, \"If you would give me\r\nall the frocks of Soudan I would not change my religion.\" I then\r\naddressed them sharply against wishing to alter the decrees of God,\r\nturning the dogmas of their religion upon themselves, and quoted the\r\nKoran,--\r\n\r\n\"Thou wilt not find out any means of enlightening him whom God delivers\r\nover to error.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately, this unexpected style of argument struck them dumb. After\r\nrecovering their senses they became restless to leave me, and began to\r\nbeg a few things. I gave them some sugar and cake, and we parted apparent\r\nfriends. On going out, they could not forbear asking Said if he was a\r\nMussulman. Like many other Moslemites of Sahara, they said, \"The Turks\r\nare not good Mussulmans.\" I replied, \"Mustapha, the Bey of Ghadames, is a\r\nbetter Mussulman than any of the Ghadamsee people.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may disapprove of my conduct in these my frequent evasions of\r\nthe question of religion; but when they reflect that it required, during\r\nmy residence in Ghat and other parts of Sahara, the whole strength of my\r\nmind, and the utmost tact, to maintain a simple and consistent\r\nconfession of myself as a Christian, and that to have said a word, or\r\neven to have breathed a syllable of disrespect for Mahomet and his\r\nreligion, would have exposed me to be torn to pieces by the rabble, and\r\nperhaps murdered in my bed, they will probably feel less disposed to\r\ncensure my conduct. If there be any doubt of this critical situation of\r\nan European who travels openly and avows himself a Christian in The\r\nSahara, all I can do is to beg of the doubter to make the experiment\r\nhimself. The reader will also be pleased to recollect, that the Denham\r\nand Clapperton party, though they travelled the safest routes of Sahara,\r\nwere protected by the Bashaw of Tripoli, and their safety was guaranteed\r\nsolemnly to our Government, as being the immediate agents and\r\nrepresentatives of the British nation; and, finally, they had a large\r\nescort of Arab cavalry from Fezzan to Bornou. Yet these tourists,\r\nsurrounded with such protection, were actually circumcised at Tripoli by\r\nDr. Dickson[72], and were accustomed to attend the mosques and perform\r\nprayer as Mussulmans. Colonel Warrington certainly told me the people saw\r\nthrough all the mummery, and laughed, or were angry. As to the Frenchman,\r\nCaillié, his eternal tale of fabrication, repeated every day, and every\r\nhour of the day, to every Sheikh, and every merchant, camel-driver, and\r\nslave of The Desert, produces a very painful impression on the mind of\r\nthe reader. Caillié's falsehood, as lie begets lie, begat many others. He\r\nwas obliged to tell the people, that Mahometans were not tolerated in\r\nChristian countries. He told the Africans, also, that slavery was\r\nabolished in Europe, at the time even when England had her thousands of\r\nWest Indian slaves. In this way, whatever service Caillié has rendered to\r\ngeography, he has damaged the moral interests of the world. The African\r\nMussulmans might say to future tourists, \"If Christians tolerate not us,\r\nwhy should we Mussulmans tolerate you,\" and assassinate the luckless\r\nEuropean tourist. Whatever, then, were my evasions on the question of\r\nreligion (and I sincerely confess I do not approve of them), I never\r\nstooped to such folly, and so far disgraced my character as an Englishman\r\nand a Christian, as to adopt the creed and character of a Mahometan. I\r\nmoreover, on reflecting upon the tremendous question, which I often\r\nrevolved in my painful journeying over The Desert--determined at all\r\nevents, at all costs, come what might, I would never profess myself a\r\nMussulman, if it were even to save my head. I thought the least I could\r\ndo was to imitate the noble example, which The Desert reports of Major\r\nLaing--Sooner than forswear my religion, be it good or bad, it was better\r\nto die! \"Mental reservation\" may be good for the Jesuits and papists[73],\r\nwho misquote the conduct of Jacob to Esau, but it is neither fit for a\r\nChristian, or a patriot, or, at any rate, for an honest man, who was, is,\r\nand ever will be,\r\n\r\n    \"The noblest work of God.\"\r\n\r\nSpent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. A Ghadamsee came in who attempted to\r\nfrighten me from going to Soudan. Haj Ibrahim has the same prejudices as\r\nthe rest of the people of Tripoli respecting the supposed wealth of the\r\nGhadamsee people. \"They have plenty of money but conceal it. Sheikh\r\nMakouran has abundance of gold, but he cunningly professes himself a poor\r\nman.\" I have lately read in a work published by the French Government,\r\nthat once upon a time, a son of old Yousef Bashaw sacked Ghadames and\r\ncarried off \"several camel-loads of gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe Touarick mode of saluting is very simple and elegant, but cold,\r\ncolder than that of the English. A Touarghee elevates deliberately the\r\nright hand to a level with his face, turning the outspread palm to the\r\nindividual, and slowly but with a fine intonation says, \"_Sălām\r\nAleikoum._\" This is all. When using his own language, a few words are\r\nadded. How strikingly contrasted are the habits of different people.\r\nAmongst the Moors and Arabs this mode of saluting is their way of\r\ncursing. With the outspread hand menacingly raised, a man or woman puts\r\ntheir enemy under the ban and curse of God. A vulgar interpretation is,\r\nthat it means \"five in your eye;\" but this custom of cursing is so remote\r\nas not now to be explained. The door-posts and rooms of houses are\r\nimprinted with the outspread hand to prevent or withstand \"the\r\neye-malign\" from glancing on them and the inhabitants its fatal\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n_20th._--Rose early, felt better in health to-day. Am, however, annoyed,\r\nbut from what cause I cannot tell. Entertain many misgivings about the\r\nclimate of Soudan, and having no medicine dispirits me. It is now too\r\nlate to retreat. \"Onward\" is the only destiny which guides men, to good\r\nor evil. Had a visit from the eldest son of the Governor. Gave him two\r\ncups of tea, a little sugar, and two biscuits, which made him my friend\r\nfor ever; a cheap purchase of eternal friendship. Shafou, he says, will\r\nnot come before the whole of the Soudan ghafalahs arrive, of which there\r\nare still some portions lagging behind. A Soudan caravan, as all Desert\r\ncaravans, is an _omnibus_; it collects parties of merchants all along the\r\nline of route, and distributes them in the same way, but having a\r\nstarting-post and a goal. Haj Ahmed's son wished to introduce the\r\nquestion of religion. \"The world is nothing and Paradise is every thing.\"\r\n\"Amen,\" I replied. \"What do you think of Mahomet?\" \"The Mahometans have\r\nMahomet, the Jews Moses, and the Christians Jesus, each for their\r\nprophet,\" I said, after which not very satisfactory answer to him, the\r\nconversation dropped. He now inquired if I had written to Tripoli to\r\nbring plenty of sugar and tea, with a latent desire for a portion of the\r\nspoil. I told him \"No,\" very emphatically.\r\n\r\nCalled at my neighbour's, Bel Kasem, and found him doctoring a poor\r\nnegress girl. She could neither eat nor drink, she vomited and purged,\r\nher bones were nearly through her skin, her stomach empty and dried up as\r\na sun-dried water-skin. Bel Kasem was rubbing her all over with oil. He\r\nasked me for medicine. I said, \"Give her something good to eat.\" He\r\nreplied, \"I have nothing.\" \"What do you eat yourself?\" I asked. \"Bread\r\nand bazeen,\" he replied. \"Give her that,\" I rejoined. He hesitated to\r\nreply, did not reply; I saw he considered such food too good for a slave,\r\neven to save its life. Such is but one dark sad picture of a thousand now\r\nbeing exhibited here! One would think God had made one part of the human\r\nrace to torment the other.\r\n\r\nSpent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. A merchant in his house related that\r\nNoufee was now convulsed with a civil war. This country is now in the\r\nhands of the Fullans. He had often visited that country, and had seen\r\nEnglish people there. A large caravan has this winter left Mourzuk for\r\nKanou _viâ_ Aheer. Haj Ibrahim pretends that the Touaricks of Aheer are\r\nbetter than those of Ghat, but the former are people of the country (or\r\npeasants), not towns. The Haj has not begun to dispose of his goods, but\r\nhe will exchange them against slaves. He, however, as a subject of Tunis,\r\nis virtually prohibited by the Bey's ordinances.\r\n\r\nMy most friendly visitors are the merchants and traders from Soudan,\r\nKanou, and Sukatou. I cannot help looking upon these people with profound\r\npity. They bring their sable brethren, of the same flesh and blood, and\r\nbarter them away for trumpery beads, coarse paper, and cloth, &c. They\r\nlittle think, that for such trifles, what miseries they inflict upon\r\ntheir helpless brethren! A Kanou merchant, in a friendly manner,\r\nrecommended me not to go to Soudan, adding, \"The Touaricks of Aheer would\r\nbutcher me because I was a Christian.\" A similar recommendation is being\r\ngiven me by the Arabs, Ghadames people, and others. Still there is a\r\ngreat variety of opinions, _pros_ and _cons_, on this subject.\r\n\r\n_21st._--Rose early, improved in health. A small bird, not much bigger\r\nthan a wren, flits about the houses as our sparrows. This is probably the\r\nJereed sparrow of Shaw, _Bou Habeeba_, or _Capsa_-sparrow, but I saw it\r\nat no other oasis except Ghat. It is of a lark colour, with a light\r\nreddish breast, flitting about continually, twittering a short and abrupt\r\nnote, but very sweet and gentle. Yesterday Haj Ahmed sent me a few dates\r\nand a little milk. To-day the Governor paid me a formal visit. He was\r\npolite and friendly. However, he observed, \"If you, Yâkob, had brought a\r\nfew presents for the Touarghee chiefs they would all have known[74] you,\r\nbut you have come without any thing, with empty hands.\" I replied that I\r\ndid not expect to come to Ghat when I left Tripoli. Nevertheless, if the\r\nTouarick chiefs were friendly, and would protect Englishmen in The\r\nDesert, both the people and Government of England would, I was quite\r\nsure, acknowledge the protection with suitable presents. He was satisfied\r\nwith the explanation. Some of our caravan had told him I had come with\r\nnothing, and had overrated my poverty as some tourists have their riches\r\noverrated. But this report of abject poverty was a great advantage to me.\r\nHe was greatly surprised when I told him the Sultan of the English was a\r\nwoman. I explained, as I had done at Ghadames, when the kings of our\r\ncountry had no sons, but had daughters, the daughters became sovereigns.\r\nMy vanity was somewhat piqued at the Governor's direct allusion to\r\npresents, and I determined, that he himself, at any rate, should have as\r\nlarge a present from me as he got from any of the foreign merchants. He\r\nthen asked me if I was an English Marabout. I replied, \"Yes;\" for a\r\nMarabout, as in the Governor's own case, means sometimes a person who can\r\ntolerably read and write. In this sense I may claim the sacred title. I\r\nalso dub myself occasionally _tabeeb_ (doctor), but mostly _taleb_, a\r\nmere literary man or pretender to literature. I believe that coming\r\nwithout arms, and as poor as possible, has had a good effect upon the\r\nTouaricks. They see, if they were so disposed, they cannot maltreat a man\r\nin my circumstances with a very good grace. I have still left, very\r\nfortunately, a supply of eye-water, and am making presents of it daily.\r\nThis solution keeps my medical diploma clean and fair in Ghat.\r\n\r\nHad another visit from the family of the Governor. All aspire to\r\nreligious discussion. Addressing me, \"Which way do you pray, east or\r\nwest?\" said another of his sons. \"I pray in all directions, for God is\r\neverywhere.\" \"You ought to pray in the east.\" \"No, for The Koran says,\r\n'The east and the west belong to God, wherever you turn you find the face\r\nof God[75].'\" He continued, \"You are idolaters, why do you pray to\r\nimages?\" \"The English people do not pray to images,\" I rejoined. As he\r\ndoubted my word, I was obliged to enter into explanations of the customs\r\nof Romanists and Protestants. It is amusing or lamentable to think, as we\r\nmay sneer at or regret the matter, that these rude children of The\r\nDesert should have ground for charging upon the high-bred and\r\n_transcendantally_-polished nations of Europe, idolatry. But, if any one,\r\ndetermined to be an impartial judge, were to visit the Madelaine of\r\nParis, and then pass rapidly over to Algeria, (a journey of a few days),\r\nand there enter the simple mosque, and compare its prostrate worshippers,\r\nin the plain unadorned temple of Islamism, with the bowing and crossing,\r\ngoing on before the pretty saints and images of the Catholic temple of\r\nthe Parisians, he could not fail to be struck with the immeasurable space\r\nwhich separates the two _cultes_, whilst the contrast, so far as the\r\neternal records of nature, impressed upon and read in the page of\r\ncreation, are involved, would be all in favour of the Moslemite deist,\r\nand pity and folly would be mingled with his ideas when appreciating the\r\npapistical _quasi_-idolator.\r\n\r\nA young Touarghee came in with the party, whose eyes were very bad. After\r\na good deal of persuasion, for he was at first quite frightened at me, he\r\nconsented to allow me to apply the caustic. He is a follower of Sheikh\r\nJabour, and employed near the person of the Sheikh. To show how smoothly\r\nthings go after the first difficulty is vanquished, I may mention, that\r\nhe visited me ever after whilst I remained in Ghat, sometimes coming\r\nevery day, and always begging his eyes might be washed with the solution.\r\nI had another visit from the Soudan traders. They say people just like me\r\ncome up to Noufee to where they are now returning. They speak Arabic very\r\nimperfectly, and are obliged to converse with signs. They describe\r\nthousands of slaves being carried away by men with white cheeks and hands\r\nlike myself, putting their hands round their wrists and their necks to\r\nshow how the slaves were ironed. These slaves are carried down the Niger\r\nto the salt water (Atlantic). I asked them how the slaves were obtained.\r\nOne of them sprung up in an instant, seizing an Arab's gun. He then\r\nperformed a squatting posture, skulking down, and creeping upon the floor\r\nof my room, and waiting or watching in silence. He then made a sudden\r\nspring, as a tiger on its prey, with a wild shout. These wily antics\r\nevidently denoted a private kidnapping expedition. Many slaves are,\r\nhowever, captives of war, for the negro princes are as fond of war as the\r\nmilitary nations of France and Prussia, and can play at soldiers as well\r\nas the King of Naples. Evening, as usual, paid a visit to Haj Ibrahim.\r\nNothing new, except an economical bill of expenses, from Ghat to Soudan,\r\nchalked out for me by a Ghadamsee, in prospect of my journey, viz:--\r\n\r\nPresents, _en route_, to various chiefs   13 dollars.\r\nWheat and bread                                 5    \"\r\nOlive-oil and _semen_ (liquid butter)      1    \"\r\nExtras and unforseen expenses                   3    \"\r\n                                              ----\r\nTotal                                          22\r\n                                              ----\r\n\r\nThis, I imagine, is about what it would cost him himself, though he\r\npretended to allow a little more for me. These 22 dollars are to carry a\r\nperson two months over Sahara and one over Negroland to Kanou. It will be\r\nseen there is nothing down for meat, or sugar, and tea and coffee, in\r\nwhich luxuries Saharan merchants rarely indulge.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70] _Sunbul_--‮سنبل‬--(literally \"stalks\"). According to French\r\n    Oriental botanists, it is \"_Nard, spina celtica_.\" An immense\r\n    quantity of this fashionable plant is brought into The Desert. No\r\n    present is made to a man of family without sunbul.\r\n\r\n[71] Nor are they _Anthropoklephts_, as a late Yankee Consul, in\r\n    his \"Notes on North Africa,\" &c., calls them. Before Mr. Hodgson\r\n    stigmatizes the Touaricks as men-stealers, he should see that his\r\n    own States are pure. The reader will agree with me, after hearing\r\n    further of the Touaricks, that these free sons of The Sahara have\r\n    every right to say to Mr. Hodgson, and all American\r\n    Consuls--\"Physician, heal thyself: do not charge us with\r\n    men-stealing when you buy and sell and rob human beings of their\r\n    liberty.\"\r\n\r\n[72] I speak on the authority of Mr. Gagliuffi, our Vice-Consul at\r\n    Mourzuk.\r\n\r\n[73] And even those who take an oath of _et ceteras_ at the\r\n    National Universities! And others who subscribe to creeds which\r\n    they do not read, or if read them, do not comprehend them.\r\n\r\n[74] That is, being on friendly terms with you.\r\n\r\n[75] See Surat ii., intitled \"The Cow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nRESIDENCE IN GHAT.\r\n\r\n     Gloves an enigma of Wonder.--Visit Sheikh Hateetah.--All Men\r\n     equal at Ghat.--Crowds of People surrounding my House to see\r\n     me.--Violent Act committed on a Man at Prayer in the\r\n     Mosque.--Extent of European Literature known at Ghat.--Continue\r\n     unwell.--Ouweek's public Apology.--Dances of the Slaves.--A\r\n     Saharan _Emeute_.--Arrival of Caravans.--Return the Visit of the\r\n     Governor.--Europe, a cluster of innumerable Islets.--Who has most\r\n     Money, Christians or Mahometans?--People more used to my presence\r\n     in Ghat.--The Prophet of the Touaricks.--Visit from Aheer\r\n     Touaricks.--The Governor's petty dealing.--The Shereef of\r\n     Moorzuk.--Visit from Jabour.--Beginning Soudanic Cottons.--Visits\r\n     from Kandarka and Zoleâ.--Route from Ghat to Alexandria, and its\r\n     distance.--The Shereef of Medina.--Character and influence of\r\n     Khanouhen, heir-apparent of the Touarghee Throne of the Azgher\r\n     Touaricks, and his arrival in Ghat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_22nd._--HAVE considerable pain in my stomach with change of diet. Did\r\nnot go out yesterday and the day before in the day-time, on account of\r\nthe rabble who follow so close at my heels, that my guides and protectors\r\ncan't keep them off. Sent a _shumlah_ (\"sash\") to Haj Ahmed, the\r\nGovernor, this morning. He expressed himself highly gratified. This makes\r\nthe Governor's present about five dollars more than he gets from any of\r\nthe merchants. The richest and most powerful merchants don't give more,\r\nand some of them not half this amount. I have already given away 20\r\ndollars out of my extremely modest resources.\r\n\r\nNothing surprises the natives of Ghat and the Touaricks so much as my\r\ngloves. I am obliged to put them off and on a hundred times a day to\r\nplease people. They then try them on, look at them inside and outside, in\r\nevery shape and way, expressing their utter astonishment by the most\r\nsacred names of Deity. Some, also, have not seen stockings before, and\r\nexamine them with much wonderment. But the gloves carry the palm in\r\nexciting the emotion of the terrible. One said, after he had put the\r\nglove on his hand, \"Ah! ah! Whey! whoo! that's the hand of the Devil\r\nhimself!\"\r\n\r\nThe _Souk_ or mart has now fairly begun. Merchants are desperately busy\r\nbuying and selling, chiefly exchanging goods against slaves. All complain\r\nof the dearness of slaves.\r\n\r\nAfternoon visited Sheikh Hateetah, \"Friend\" or \"Consul\" of the English.\r\nFound him still unwell; he complains of pain in his bowels. This is the\r\ncase with most people in Ghat, myself amongst the rest. It cannot be the\r\nwater, for it is the purest and sweetest of The Desert. Prescribed a\r\nlittle medicine for the Sheikh, who promises to introduce me to Sultan\r\nShafou when he arrives. Returned by another route, and in this manner\r\nmade the tour of the town. Half an hour is fully enough to walk round the\r\nmere walls of the city, but then there are considerable suburbs,\r\nconsisting of huts and stone and mud houses. At the Sheikh's I met a\r\nmerchant just returned from Kanou; I put some questions to him, who,\r\nthinking I wished to have every one answered in the affirmative, gave me\r\nhis terrible \"yahs\" and \"aywahs\" to all and everything demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Are there many people ill in Kanou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, many.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the route to Kanou unsafe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there banditti in route?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it hot in Kanou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very hot, very hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there fever in Kanou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, always.\"\r\n\r\nThis I thought was good news. I fear we often get incorrect intelligence\r\nfrom these people, through their anxiety to answer all our questions in\r\nthe affirmative, they not understanding that we put the questions to them\r\nsimply to gain information.\r\n\r\nAll men are indeed equal here, as saith the Governor. There seems to be\r\nno ruling authority, and every one does what is right in his own eyes.\r\nYesterday, although the Governor knew that some of his slaves or other\r\npeople had stolen my sugar, he never condescended to mention the\r\ncircumstance, by speaking to his eldest son about the theft; he said\r\nabsurdly enough, \"Oh, if we knew the thief, we would put him to death.\"\r\nOn protesting against such punishment for the offence, he rejoined, \"Oh,\r\nbut we would cut off his hand.\" This is all stuff, and a proof of the\r\nweakness of the Governor's authority. Happily, however, there's no crime\r\nworth naming in the oasis.\r\n\r\nAm obliged to keep the door shut to prevent people from rushing into the\r\nhouse by twenties and fifties at once. The Governor has sent strict\r\norders to his slaves to keep the door shut, first, to prevent me from\r\nbeing pestered to death all day long, and, secondly, because some of the\r\npeople have got the habit here, as in Europe, of picking up little\r\nthings. A young slave is crying out, \"Bago! bago!\" every five minutes, in\r\nanswer to knocking at the door to see The Christian, which we interpret\r\nin European phrase more politely, \"Not at home,\" but which signifieth in\r\nthe original Housa, \"No, no.\" However, a troop of the lower class of\r\nTouaricks managed to squeeze in as some of our people went out, but I got\r\nrid of them without angry words.\r\n\r\nA Ghadamsee resident here, came in to-day, with a severe gash on his\r\nhands, and one of his fingers, to ask my advice and beg medicine. The\r\ngash was inflicted upon him whilst at prayer, by a vagabond Touarghee.\r\nThe assailant alleged as the reason of his violent act, that the\r\nGhadamsee had called him a thief amongst the people, adding, that he (the\r\nTouarghee) had stolen two skin-bags out of a house. For such violence,\r\nsuch a daring act perpetrated on a man whilst in the solemn performance\r\nof prayer, our Marabout Governor was obliged to give satisfaction to the\r\ninjured party. His Excellency stripped the house of the Touraghee of all\r\nhis little property, turned him out into the street, and ordered him\r\nimmediately to leave Ghat. To the honour, and humanity, and morality of\r\nthe inhabitants of this part of The Sahara, such acts of violence are\r\nextremely rare. The Ghadamsee had poulticed his hand with wet clay and\r\ncamel's dung. I recommended a bread poultice, but he kept to his day and\r\ncamel's dung. The Saharans mostly prefer their own remedies, though they\r\nmay condescend to ask you your advice. Bought some olive oil from the\r\nArabs of Gharian. Before pouring it out they wished me to put sugar in\r\nthe measure. I suspected some trick, and refused. As soon as the measure\r\nwas out of my servant's hand, they seized it, some licking it, others\r\nrubbing their hands in it, and then oiling their bread. They wanted to\r\nhave a lick at the sugar, which would have settled down at the bottom;\r\nand were very angry with me because I did not take their advice of\r\nimproving the oil with my sugar. These Arabs are really more greedy and\r\nrapacious than the Touaricks. The difference is, the Arabs are near\r\nTripoli, see Europeans, and learn to be more polite to us than the\r\nTouaricks can well be.\r\n\r\nA son of the Governor recited to me the following famous distich, begging\r\nme to tell him what it meant:--\r\n\r\n    \"Tummora, tummora, tera,\r\n    Buon giorno, buona sera.\"\r\n\r\nOn inquiring how he learned it, he told me a Moor of Tripoli taught it\r\nhim. This seems to be the extent of European literature acquired by the\r\nGhateen.\r\n\r\n_23rd._--Continue to have pains in my stomach, and feel very weak. Am\r\nundecided whether I shall go or not to Soudan. However, Haj Ibrahim has\r\nkindly offered to let me have twenty-five dollars' worth of goods on\r\ncredit, which, in the case of my going, will relieve me from every\r\nembarrassment as to money for the present, until I can get a remittance\r\nfrom Tripoli, for these twenty-five dollars will furnish the presents and\r\nexpenses of the route, and allow me to retain some twenty or thirty\r\ndollars in my pocket. The reader will and must smile at this mighty\r\nstatement of my financial affairs, worthy of a Desert Budget!\r\n\r\nEssnousee called. Ouweek is a personal friend of his; Essnousee\r\nsays:--\"Ouweek has told us, he feared from you (myself), for the English\r\nhad never before been in his district. For the rest, he was only playing\r\nwith you. He wished to see whether an Englishman was a man of courage.\r\nThis you proved to be, for you sat down and ate dates and biscuit whilst\r\nhe was threatening to kill you. It also proved that you knew that he\r\n(Ouweek) was playing with you, for how could you eat dates if you thought\r\nhe was going to kill you.\" This is Ouweek's defence about town. I heard\r\nalso a curious version about the slave who ran to the horse. Zaleâ says,\r\nthe slave ran there to get Ouweek farther from me, giving me an\r\nopportunity, if I chose, of escaping to Ghat. This affair still occupies\r\npublic attention, but Ouweek keeps his present, and evidently will not\r\nrestore it despite the threats of Jabour. Essnousee tells me not to be\r\nafraid of Ouweek, for he has influence with the Sheikh.\r\n\r\nA Souk of _little things_ has just been opened, and provisions, with all\r\nsorts of small articles, the manufacture of Soudan and Aheer, are exposed\r\nfor sale in the public square. Formerly, these matters were purchased at\r\nprivate houses. This is a step in the march of Saharan commerce.\r\n\r\nYesterday evening, the poor slaves danced and sung till midnight in the\r\npublic squares. Ever-pitying Providence, so permits an hour of gaiety to\r\nsuffering humanity, under circumstances the most adverse to happiness!\r\nThe slaves of the caravan are, a few of them, permitted to join those of\r\nthe town, and the exiled slaves sometimes obtain intelligence in this way\r\nof their country. Generally the slaves imported are from such a variety\r\nof districts in Negroland, and so widely apart, that the slaves of The\r\nSahara can hear little of their native homes. I asked Bel Kasem, if the\r\nslaves of the Ghafalah were prisoners of war. \"No,\" he replied, \"there is\r\nno war now in Soudan; these are captured with matchlocks at night by\r\nrobbers (sbandout); the negro is frightened out of his wits at the sound\r\nof fire-arms.\"\r\n\r\nAfternoon there was a tremendous hubbub in the public square or\r\nmarket-place, the Negresses flying in all directions from the scene of\r\ntumult. One of Haj Ahmed's negresses comes running to me: \"Shut the door,\r\nshut the door, the world is upset, the world is upset! Haj Ahmed, my\r\nmaster, is no Sheikh, no Sultan. He can't keep the people quiet. I'm\r\ngoing, I'm going.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"I'm going to another and\r\nquieter country, to Haj Ahmed, my master, to tell him the news.\" This is\r\na very lively negress, her tongue never stops; she retails all the news\r\nof the country to me, and is a great politician in her way. Some of these\r\nGhat negresses are actually witty, and crack jokes with the grave\r\nTouaricks. The Touaricks are too gallant to be offended with the freedom\r\nof even female slaves. I felt somewhat alarmed, thinking the discomfitted\r\nparty might come and avenge their defeat upon the unlucky Christian\r\nstranger. We barricaded the door, and kept quiet, anxiously waiting the\r\nresult, as people do in Paris, when an _emeute_ is being enacted for the\r\nespecial benefit of the Parisians. Afterwards I learnt the particulars of\r\nthis strange tumult. There is an old half-cracked Sheikh, who goes every\r\nday into the public square, and strikes his spear into the ground, and\r\nretiring at a distance, exclaims aloud to all present, \"Whoever dares to\r\ntouch that spear I'll kill him!\" To-day a young Touarick passed by, and\r\nseeing the spear sticking up very formidably, as if challenging\r\nall-passers by, went near it, and said, \"What's this?\" and took hold of\r\nit. The crazy Sheikh was watching at some distance, and now was his\r\nopportunity to show the people his determined will and resolution. He\r\nrushes at the lad with his dagger in hand. In an instant the whole place\r\nis in wild tumult, cries and shouts rend the air, with a forest of spears\r\nbrandishing over the heads of Touaricks, Arabs, Moors, slaves, men,\r\nwomen, and children, mingling together, and running over one another in a\r\nfrightful _melée_. The boy is rescued, the people resume their lounging\r\nseats, the storm drops to a dead calm, and nobody is hurt, not even\r\nscratched. Such is a row amongst these untutored children of The Desert.\r\nHow different to the Thuggee rows now being enacted in Ireland!\r\n\r\nAfterwards paid a visit to Bel Kasem. He complained bitterly of slaves\r\nbeing dear. A slave is sold at from 40 to 100 dollars. The mediate price\r\nis 60 to 70. Two months ago good slaves were sold at 30 and 40 dollars\r\neach. The reason given is the great quantity of merchandize arrived\r\ndirect from Tripoli, besides from the lateral routes of Ghadames and\r\nMourzuk. The English Vice-Consul of the latter city has sent quantities\r\nof goods to this mart, but these are exchanged only for senna and ivory.\r\nThis evening arrived another Tripoline merchant with twenty camels of\r\nmerchandize. He came _viâ_ Mizdah and Shaty, and was forty-five days _en\r\nroute_. The Touat caravan (very small) has arrived, bringing Touat\r\nwoollen barracans and Timbuctoo gold. The affair of the Timbuctoo caravan\r\nis differently reported. It is now said the people killed were the\r\ninhabitants of Ain Salah. The Desert is a great exaggerator and\r\nmisinterpreter. It is very difficult to get correct news.\r\n\r\n_24th._--Better in health this morning, after taking medicine yesterday.\r\nFirst thing, returned the visit of the Governor. When I go out early,\r\nfind few persons about the streets. People are up as late in winter as\r\nthey are early in summer. The Touaricks of the suburban huts do not come\r\nto town till very late in the morning, when the Souk begins. His\r\nExcellency treated me with three cups of coffee. He said, \"You must take\r\nthree, because it is the destined number of hospitality, and as many more\r\nas you choose.\" It was wretched stuff--hot water and sugar, blackened or\r\ndiluted with a little badly-ground coffee. But his Excellency thought he\r\nwas conferring upon me a vast favour. Few people drink coffee in this\r\ncountry, and it is considered a great luxury. A man from Bengazi, a\r\nvisitor, was also treated with his three cups of coffee. These Saharans\r\nhave strange notions in their heads respecting the geography of England,\r\nand the capabilities of its inhabitants in travelling. The Governor asked\r\nme, \"If the English could travel by land?\" I was astonished at the\r\nquestion, but I saw he imagined our country, and European countries\r\ngenerally, to be so many little islets in the ocean[76]. It is curious,\r\nlikewise, how old this notion is. The Hebrew prophets, who were bad\r\ngeographers, depicted all western Europe as \"the isles of the sea.\" The\r\nGovernor continued, \"But can you travel on land, when water is wanted, as\r\nin this country?\" Before the French occupied Algiers, the Saharans\r\nthought it impossible for Christians to invade, or even to travel in,\r\ntheir country. This gave the French invading army such a vast prestige\r\nwhen they once got upon _terrâ firma_. The event was as unexpected and\r\nmarvelled at as the immediate results were decisive and brilliant. I\r\nanswered, \"In travelling through Christian countries, water is met with\r\nevery day. If it be necessary to carry water however, water is carried.\r\nThe French carry it in Algeria, and the English in India, when the\r\ncountry is dry and desert, on the backs of camels.\" His Excellency,\r\ngreatly surprised, \"What! impossible! Have the Christians camels? God\r\ngave the camels only to the Faithful.\" I returned, \"We have troops of\r\ncamels.\" \"And where do you get camels?\" asked the Governor, with great\r\nseriousness. \"The French buy camels from Mussulmans in Algeria, and the\r\nEnglish keep camels in India.\" \"Ah!\" observed the Governor, \"those French\r\nMussulmans sell camels to infidels. They themselves are infidels.\" His\r\nExcellency now inquired about religion, and whether all Christians had\r\nbooks (_i. e._ books of religion). As before noticed, there is a\r\nprevailing opinion here that Protestants have no Scriptures, whilst,\r\nindeed, as we know, they are the Christians who only, _bonâ fide_, have\r\nthe free use of the Scriptures. I saw that Haj Ahmed, though a Marabout,\r\nwas sufficiently ignorant on the religion of Christians. His Excellency\r\nthen asked about money.\r\n\r\n\"Who have the most money, Mussulmans or the English?\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"The English, The Sultan of Constantinople has no money, or spends\r\nit faster than he gets it. Mehemet Ali has but little money. However,\r\nMuley Abd Errahman has some saved up in the vaults of Mekinas.\"\r\n\r\n_The Governor._--\"Muley Abd Errahman belongs to us; we are his subjects.\r\nWe have nothing to do with the Turks or the Touaricks. As the English\r\nhave much money, why have not you much?\"\r\n\r\nThis question--this home-thrust--was made in a peculiarly arch way.\r\n\r\n\"If I had brought much money,\" I replied, as pointedly, \"I'm sure I\r\nshould have been murdered before I got to Ghat. All my friends, and the\r\nRais of Ghadames told me not to carry any money with me.\"\r\n\r\nThis clear and positive statement made the visitors, who were numerous,\r\nburst out laughing. His Excellency, taken by surprise, asked abruptly,\r\n\"How? Why?\" I added, \"Two Englishmen have been murdered in The Desert,\r\nthe one near Wadnoun (Davidson), and the other near Timbuctoo (Major\r\nLaing), and both upon the supposition of their having possessed much\r\nmoney.\" The Governor at once dropped the subject, thinking I was going to\r\nbring upon the tapis Ouweek. His Excellency often quizzes me about having\r\nno money, evidently not believing a word of my alleged poverty. I then\r\nasked the Governor what he thought of the great camel-driver, Kandarka,\r\nwho conducts the caravans, and nearly all the Ghadamseeah between Ghat\r\nand Aheer. He answered, to my surprise, _Ma nâraf_, \"I don't know,\" for\r\nKandarka has an excellent reputation. This was the jesuitism of the Moor.\r\n\r\nI took leave, and was escorted to Hateetah by my young Touarghee friend,\r\nwhose eyes I'm doctoring. On our way we met his master, Sheikh Jabour,\r\nwho stopped to salute us. Afterwards, somebody hailed us from a hut. My\r\nTouarghee friend turned and said, \"They want to see you.\" We went, and I\r\nfound several of my Ghadamsee acquaintance and some Touarghee people of\r\nconsequence, all squatting down on the sand in a gossiping circle. They\r\nsoon began on the troublesome subject of religion, after they had\r\ngratified their curiosity in staring at me and through me. One said to\r\nthe Ghadamsee people, \"Tell the Christian to repeat, 'There's one God,'\"\r\n&c. I was determined to risk an abrupt answer. I said, \"This saying is\r\nprohibited to Christians.\" At this stop-mouth answer they burst out into\r\na fit of hilarity. But one fellow, who wished to show some zeal, growled\r\nout, \"Be off, be off.\" My good-natured young Touarghee quickly got up\r\nfrom the circle, where he had taken his seat, and smiling, took me by the\r\narm, whispering in my ear, \"Come along, Yâkob, these are brutish people.\"\r\nWe found Hateetah better. I asked him seriously if there was danger in my\r\ngoing to Aheer. He observed, \"Without a letter from Shafou you can't go,\r\nthe merchants can't and won't protect you. Some of them are big rascals,\r\nworse than us Touaricks, and will sell you as a slave for a dollar.\" Many\r\nconcur in this opinion. I found the Ghatee people more peaceable in the\r\nstreets, now the novelty of my appearance is diminishing. When I pay a\r\nvisit to a person of consequence I always put on my European clothes,\r\nwhich compliment is perfectly understood, for I offended an old Sheikh\r\nwith going to him with my burnouse on instead of my French cloak. He said\r\nto my uncouth cicerone, \"This Christian doesn't pay me respect, why\r\ndoesn't he dress himself in Christian clothes?\" Hateetah always makes me\r\npromise to return by the eastern side of the city, where we meet with\r\nvery few persons. Saw Haj Ibrahim on my return. He complains of the\r\nmarket:--\"Slaves are very dear. What can we do? We are obliged to buy\r\nthem; there is nothing else in the market. Only a small quantity of\r\nelephants' teeth and a little senna. Besides these, nothing else sells in\r\nTripoli.\"\r\n\r\nReturning from the merchants, \"Whey! whey! whoo! whoo! whoo!\" saluted my\r\nears. This noise came from a group of people surrounding _En-Nibbee\r\nTarghee_, \"The Prophet of the Touaricks.\" The salute was followed by a\r\nnumber of persons who rushed upon me, carried me by force into the\r\npresence of The Prophet. The Seer, seeing me discomposed, said in a kind\r\ntone, \"_Gheem_,\" (sit down). Now there was profoundest silence, not a\r\nmurmur was heard amongst a hundred people crowded together. The Seer\r\nstood up before me, and, assuming an imposing attitude, spoke in\r\nmonosyllabic style, the usual address adopted by North African and\r\nSaharan prophets,--\r\n\r\n\"Christian, Ghat, good, you?\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"Yes, the people are good to me.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Three! one!\" (putting out one finger of the right hand,\r\nand three of the left hand.)\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"There is one God!\" (knowing the prophet meant this, for it is\r\nthe usual way of badgering Christians about the Trinity in North\r\nAfrica.)\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Good:\" (then making the sign of the cross by putting his\r\ntwo forefingers into the shape of a cross.) \"But you Christians worship\r\nthis (the cross) of wood, stone, iron, brass. This is not good, not\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"No, we English do not worship wood, stone, iron, or brass.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"You lie, you lie.\" (At this emphatic negative, up\r\nstepped one of my Ghadamsee friends to the Prophet, and told him that the\r\nEnglish did not worship the cross or images like some other Christians.)\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Good, right, sublime. What's your name?\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._-\"Yâkob.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"You, dog, Jew.\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"No. This is the Arabic of my English name.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._-\"Good, good; Yâkob, do you steal?\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"Please God, I hope not.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Yâkob, do you lie?\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"Please God, I hope not.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Yâkob, do you strike?\" (_i. e._ kill.)\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"Please God, I hope not.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Good, good, good. Have you seen the Kafers in Algiers?\"\r\n(_i. e._ the French.)\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"I have.\"\r\n\r\n_The Prophet._--\"Have they houses where women are kept, and twenty men go\r\nin and sleep with one woman in an hour?\" (At this question, the multitude\r\nshowed intense anxiety to hear the result.)\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nI had scarcely made answer when two women rushed upon the Prophet and\r\ndragged him away crying, \"_Yamout, Mat:_ he is dying! he is dead!\" As the\r\nProphet was pulled away he turned to me mildly and said, \"_Yâkob, inker_,\r\nArise, James.\" I inquired where he was being dragged to, and was told\r\nthat the husband of the two women was just dead, and the Prophet was\r\ngoing to see whether he could raise him from the dead. The Prophet had\r\nalready raised several people from death to life. It is a pity this\r\nbarbarian prophet could not be transported from the sands of The Sahara\r\nto the marble pavement of the Vatican, where he might harangue Pope Pius\r\nIX. and his Cardinals in the style of an Iconoclast, and induce the\r\nSacred College to abolish their scandal of image-worship. The Prophet\r\nwears a leathern dress, or dried skins, from head to foot. His repute of\r\nsanctity fills the surrounding deserts with its holy odours. The number\r\nof miracles he performs is prodigious. His leathern burnouse, like the\r\nHoly Tunic of Treves, is frequently carried about to cure the sick and\r\nwork miracles.\r\n\r\nComing home, I had a visit from some Touaricks of Aheer. They were\r\nuncommonly civil, addressing me: \"If you go with us, you have nothing to\r\nfear. In Aheer, people will not call out to you in the streets as in\r\nGhat. We have a Sultan. Here there is no Sultan.\" They were amazed at my\r\nlittle keys. I promised one of them, that, in case of my arriving safe in\r\nAheer, I would give him a little lock and key. This delighted him; and\r\ntwo pieces of sugar, one each, made these Aheer Touaricks excellent\r\nfriends. Have visits from the Ghateen. Several of these people are going\r\nto Soudan with the return caravan.\r\n\r\nIn better spirits to-day. Have been suffering from \"The Boree.\" Such a\r\nvariety of discouraging influences press upon the mind, that it is very\r\ndifficult to keep it buoyant. Poor Said, he gives way in tears. He is\r\nbecome terrified at the prospect of Soudan; he repeats, \"The Touaricks\r\nwill kill you, and make me a slave again.\"\r\n\r\nHad another visit from the uncle of Sheikh Jabour, a poor old gentleman.\r\nI got rid of him by a bit of white sugar, which he munched as a little\r\nchild. He says, \"One thousand Touarghee warriors are going against the\r\nShânbah after the mart is held.\" Was to-day astonished to hear, that a\r\nfew dates, a little gusub, a few onions, and a few stones of dates, which\r\na female slave offers for sale in the streets, belong to Haj Ahmed the\r\nGovernor! His Excellency sends the poor woman every morning to sell this\r\nmiserable merchandize, and she regularly pays into his hands the price\r\nand profits every evening. This is one of the wrinkles of the Great\r\nGovernor Marabout, who lives in a palace, and reigns as king and priest\r\nof Ghat and the Ghateen[77]! What shall I hear next? I am not surprised,\r\nsome of the Ghadamsee merchants sneer at the idea of Haj Ahmed being \"a\r\nMarabout of odour.\" Essnousee sent me a little present of vermicelli and\r\ncuscasou, or _hamsa_. He certainly behaves better than the other\r\nGhadamsee merchants resident here. I'm told, there will not be many\r\nTouarick visitors this year at Ghat. They have unexpected occupation to\r\ndefend themselves against the sanguinary forays of the Shânbah. And then,\r\nthe late rains having produced abundant herbage, they are also occupied\r\nin grazing the camels. The merchants congratulate me on these\r\ncircumstances, and say I shall have less presents to distribute.\r\n\r\nMet at Haj Ibrahim's a Shereef of Mourzuk, who pretends he is going to\r\nSoudan. This is a little thin fellow, who glides into people's houses\r\nthrough the keyhole, importunately begging on the strength of his being\r\nof the family of the Prophet, and lives by the same pretensions. He has a\r\nsmiling face, with his head reclined always on one side from his habit of\r\nincessant importunities; of course, he has not a para in his pocket. But,\r\nnevertheless, he managed a few months ago to ally himself with the family\r\nof a rich merchant, marrying the sister of my friend Mohammed Kafah, one\r\nof the Ghatee millionnaires. Kafah is thoroughly disgusted with his\r\nsister's marriage, and gives them nothing to eat, or only enough to keep\r\nhis sister from dying of starvation. One of the Shereef's items of\r\nimportunity, is his incessant abuse of his brother-in-law, because he\r\nwon't keep him in idleness. This little sorry shrimpy _quasi_-impostor\r\ncan neither read nor write. He tells me it is quite unnecessary. The\r\nblood of the Prophet makes him noble, and fit for heaven at any time\r\nRubbee may decree his death. He is professionally and continually begging\r\nfrom me, and says with a whining pomposity, \"Put yourself under my\r\nprotection, I will escort you safe to Soudan. No one dare lift a finger\r\nagainst a Christian under the protection of a Shereef!\" But it's odd,\r\nthese and such offers of protection come from many quarters. The\r\ncamel-drivers and conducteurs look upon me as a good speculation. The\r\nShereef pretends that there are no less than two hundred of his family\r\nin Soudan, and some nearly black, on account of their intermarriages with\r\nnegroes. One thing I like in the little wretch, he seems devoid of a\r\nspark of bigotry against Christians. It may be that his mind is too\r\nimpotent for the malicious feeling. \"Gagliuffi,\" he says, \"is my friend.\r\nI'm the protector of the English at Mourzuk.\" Mustapha of Tripoli has cut\r\nme because I would not allow him to charge me double for the sugar,\r\ncloves, and sunbul, which I purchased of him. A pretty rogue is this; but\r\nI forgive him, for his voluntary and opportune services in interpreting\r\nfor me on my arrival in Ghat.\r\n\r\n_25th._--Christmas Day! Not a merry Christmas for me--in truth, a sad, an\r\nunhappy one. And yet I ought to be content, having food and raiment, and\r\nenjoying the protection of God amidst strangers, in The Inhospitable\r\nDesert! It is better for a man to pray for a happy mind than for riches\r\nand celebrity. Weather has been mostly fine during the ten days I have\r\nresided here. But this morning broke angrily, followed with a tremendous\r\ngale, blowing from the east, prostrating all the palms, and filling the\r\nair with sand, as a thrice condensed London November fog. It is besides\r\nvery cold, and is so far Christmas weather. I may add, the weather\r\ncontinued unusually cold this Souk. People had not had such cold for many\r\na year. Received a visit from the Sheikh Jabour, who expressed himself\r\nuncommonly friendly, and said, \"If anything unpleasant occurs, call for\r\nme.\" I showed him some cuts of a book, in which were drawings of Moors.\r\nHe was wonder-stricken. The sight of a date-palm pleased him exceedingly,\r\ntickling the fancy of his followers who accompanied him. The Sheikh\r\npromised me a letter for the Sultan of Aheer, and to send a slave of his\r\nown with me as far as Aheer. Jabour did not positively assert that\r\nTripoli belonged to the English, and contented himself with asking, \"If\r\nTripoli were English?\" I explained fully to the Sheikh, as he is a man of\r\na fine ingenuous mind, that Asker Ali was recalled by the Sultan of\r\nStamboul on the representations of the British Consul of Tripoli, the\r\nPasha being a blood-thirsty tyrant, the enemy of the Christians as well\r\nas the Mussulmans; and that the Consul has influence in Tripoli, but\r\nTripoli belongs to the Sultan. The Ghadamsee interpreter observed, \"The\r\nEnglish and the Mussulmans are the same.\" \"Certainly,\" I replied,\r\n\"without the English the French would soon eat up the Sultan of the West\r\n(Morocco), and the Russians the Sultan of the East (Turkey).\" \"That's\r\ngood,\" observed Jabour; \"Still, we in The Desert, fear neither Christians\r\nnor Sultan. And if the English require our assistance they can have it.\r\nTell this on your return to your Sultan.\" This amiable prince then took\r\nleave. If there be a desert aristocrat of gentle blood, it is\r\nunquestionably Jabour. A shoal of low Touaricks came to me afterwards, in\r\nthe Sheikh's name, to beg. I saw through the _ruse_, and they were savage\r\nin being obliged to go off empty-handed. Some Touarick ladies now tried\r\nto squeeze in as the door was opened, and, in spite of the \"bago, bago,\"\r\ngot up stairs to the terrace. They had all the tips of their noses, the\r\nround of the chins, and the bones of their cheeks, blackened. At first I\r\ncould not make out how it was. It was explained that the dye of the\r\nSoudan cottons, which they wore, produced this blacky tipping. These\r\ncottons begrime their wearers sadly, the colour is not fast, the indigo\r\nbeing ill prepared. Some of the blue cottons are highly glazed. Men and\r\nwomen wear them, being cheap and light clothing for the summer.\r\n\r\n_26th._--Relieved from pain, but getting very thin, although my habits\r\nare now what are called sedentary. I rarely sit up when at home, mostly\r\nreclining. So far I am become a _bonâ fide_ Saharan habitant. Kandarka\r\ncalled again to-day at my request. He professed to be very uncivil or\r\nvery serious, and asked a large sum for conducting me to Soudan, like a\r\nreal man of business, quite inconsistent with the present state of my\r\nfinances. He asks no less than 150 dollars in goods, including camels for\r\nriding, and other attentions. This is more than he gets from all the\r\nmerchants put together, in fact, nearly twice as much. But if it be\r\nnecessary to strike the bargain, I'm sure he will come down to fifty. My\r\nhealth is breaking down very fast, and I have great hesitation on the\r\nsubject of a farther advance into the interior. I have been thinking of\r\ncontinuing my tour to Egypt and Syria, and Constantinople, visiting all\r\nthe slave-marts of the Mediterranean. Had a visit from Zaleâ, and found\r\nhim the same man as _en route_. But he is always a little wild and\r\nplayful. He is against my proceeding farther, and tells me to get off on\r\nmy return before Shafou comes, that the Touaricks may not get all the\r\nmoney I have. I am at present, however, so satisfied with the Touaricks,\r\nthat I would give them a camel-load of dollars if I had them. Shafou is\r\nstill occupied in the neighbouring districts, enrolling troops for the\r\nShânbah expedition. The Bengazi merchant persuades me to accompany him.\r\nFrom Ghat to the first oasis of Fezzan, there are 10 days; from thence\r\nto Sockna, 10; from Sockna to Augelah, 10; thence to Seewah, 14 days\r\nmore; and thence to Alexandria, 14 more days.\r\n\r\nWeather is dull to-day, but not very cold. All the Arabs and people of\r\nGhadames abuse Ghat: it is assuredly a sufficiently wretched place.\r\nHowever, the scenery around is much more lively and picturesque than that\r\nof Ghadames. A great quantity of elephants' teeth arrived yesterday (not\r\nto be sold here), on their way to Ghadames. Also some Soudanic sheep for\r\nthis market, selling as low as three dollars each. Had a visit from the\r\neldest son of the Governor, and his nephew the Medina Shereef. This\r\nShereef must be carefully distinguished from the little mad-cap impostor\r\nof Mourzuk mentioned before. I have not found so gentlemanly a person in\r\nall Ghat and Ghadames. He was born in Medina, but brought up here; he is\r\nthe son of the Governor's sister, who is married a second time to the\r\nSheikh Khanouhen, heir-apparent to the throne. The Shereef's mother is\r\nnot a Touarick woman, and the Sheikh has another wife of Touarick\r\nextraction in the districts. Of course Khanouhen is strongly recommended\r\nto me by his son-in-law. \"Khanouhen,\" he says, \"has all the wisdom and\r\neloquence of the country in his head and heart. Shafou is an old man, and\r\ntalks little. Whatever Khanouhen plans, Shafou approves; whatever\r\nKhanouhen says in words, Shafou orders to be done.\" Had a visit from a\r\nTouatee, just arrived. He recommended me to go to Timbuctoo, and fear\r\nnothing. \"What have the Touaricks of Ghat done to you that you are afraid\r\nto visit the Touaricks of my country and Timbuctoo?\" he added. Now came\r\nin two Soudanese merchants. One of them said, \"Say 'There is but one\r\nGod,' &c.\" I answered \"This is prohibited to us,\" which made them laugh\r\nout. They have not that fierce bigotry of the north-coast merchants.\r\nVisited Haj Ibrahim. He says, \"Wait for me till next year, and we'll both\r\ngo together to Soudan. I'll protect you.\" Certainly this Moor has\r\nhitherto shown himself extremely friendly to me. Khanouhen came in this\r\nevening from the country.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] 1s xLi. 1, 5; xLix, i.

Feel better in health. The Touarghee Sultan,\r\nMohammed Shafou Ben Seed, came in this morning from the country\r\ndistricts. His Highness is Sultan of all the Ghat Touaricks, or those of\r\n_Azgher_.\r\n\r\nArrived to-day another portion of the Soudan ghafalah. There was a false\r\nreport this morning of the appearance of the Shânbah. Musket firing was\r\nheard in various directions, and the people ran together, some mounting\r\nthe tops of the houses to see the fighting which was supposed to be going\r\non between the Shânbah and Touaricks. The Arabs, with their matchlocks in\r\ntheir hands, ran after their camels to prevent them from being carried\r\noff. The hubbub was most singular and bewildering. I expected to have to\r\nreport skirmish after skirmish, in the capture of Ghat, for the benefit\r\nof The Leading London Journal. The true cause at length appeared in the\r\narrival of the Sultan, the firing of matchlocks heard at a distance being\r\ndone in honour of His Highness, and his coming to his town residence. So\r\nit is, in a little place like this a false report may work wonders in a\r\nfew minutes. People are charmed with these rumours: they are their oral\r\nnewspaper excitement. In the streets were now heard \"Shafou! Shafou!\" \"It\r\nis Shafou! It is Shafou! It is Shafou!\" \"Shafou has come!\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Sultan arrived, without waiting more than three or four\r\nhours, I determined to visit His Highness, and carry him a small present.\r\nI could not yet tell how the Sultan would look upon my projected journey\r\nto Soudan. Fortunately I found Essnousee in the streets, who volunteered\r\nhis services as interpreter. Haj Ibrahim was also so good as to embrace\r\nthe opportunity of going with us. This had a good effect, and served to\r\ngive my visit consequence, Haj Ibrahim being the most respectable\r\nforeigner now in Ghat. He was also a stranger to His Highness as well as\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nWe found His Highness, at about a quarter of a mile's distance out of the\r\ntown, sitting down by himself alone upon the sand, aside of a large\r\n_hasheesh_ house, or hut of date-palm branches. The attendants of His\r\nHighness, who were not very numerous, sat at a considerable distance off.\r\nIn this primitive way and Desert style he had been receiving various\r\npersonages ever since his arrival this morning. As soon as His Highness\r\nsaw us approaching him, he bade us welcome by signs and salutations in\r\nthe style of the Touaricks, slowly raising his right arm, as high as his\r\nshoulders, and turning the palm of the outspread hand to us. Haj Ibrahim\r\nwas first introduced, but the Sultan could not keep off his eyes from me.\r\nAt last the Sultan made a sign to Essnousee to speak on my behalf.\r\nEssnousee explained very deliberately and minutely everything respecting\r\nme--where and when he saw me at Tripoli, how I went to Ghadames, came\r\nhere from that place, and what were my intentions in proposing to go to\r\nSoudan. The Sultan then turned to me, and said, \"Go, Christian, wherever\r\nyou please; in my country fear nothing--go where everybody else goes.\"\r\nAfter this I presented my little backsheesh to His Highness, consisting\r\nof a small carpet-rug to sit or recline upon, a zamailah or turban, and a\r\nshumlah or sash, large and full, and scarlet, like the Spaniards wear. On\r\ngiving the servant of His Highness the present, (which was covered, and\r\nnot exposed before His Highness, as a matter of delicacy,) I said,\r\nthrough Essnousee, \"This present is from me, and not from my Sultan, nor\r\nthe Consul at Tripoli, nor any persons in my country; it is extremely\r\nsmall, and scarcely worth accepting. But, probably, if your Highness\r\nshould protect Englishmen through your country, and allow English\r\nmerchants to come and traffic in Ghat, a greater and richer present will\r\nbe sent to you hereafter.\" His Highness replied, \"Thank you; I'm an old\r\nman now, and want but little: we have a little bread, and milk of the\r\nnagah (she-camel), and for which we praise God. Don't fear our people--no\r\none shall hurt you.\" Indeed, I saw the old gentleman was thankful for any\r\ntrifle. My little backsheesh was, perhaps, of the value of ten dollars,\r\nand was the largest present I had yet made. I then asked His Highness\r\nwhether he would write a letter for me to the Sultan of Aheer, and one to\r\nthe Queen of England, stating that he would give protection to all\r\nBritish subjects passing through The Touarghee Desert? The Sultan\r\nreplied, \"All that you want I will do for you, please God.\" I determined\r\nto risk a word on Desert politics. I said, \"Your Highness must\r\nexterminate the Shânbah, for they are a band of robbers.\" The Sultan\r\nreplied, \"Please God we will; we are now preparing the camels to go out\r\nagainst them.\" Essnousee and Haj Ibrahim considered the words of the\r\nSultan delivered in the most friendly spirit. Shafou was dressed very\r\nplainly and very dirtily; and yet there sat upon his aged countenance\r\n(for he was full seventy years of age) a most venerable expression of\r\ndignity. His Highness wore a dark-blue cotton frock of Soudanic\r\nmanufacture, and black-blue trowsers of the same kind of cotton. On his\r\nhead was a red cap, around which was folded in very large folds a white\r\nturban. He had, like all Touaricks, a dagger suspended under the left\r\narm, but no other weapon near him, or on his person. By his side, on the\r\nsand, lay a huge stick with which he walks, instead of the lance. His\r\nmouth and chin were covered with a thin blue cotton wrapper, a portion of\r\nthe _litham_. Around his neck were suspended a few amulets, sewn up in\r\nred leathern bags. His Highness was without shoes, and his legs were\r\nquite bare; his feet lay half-buried in the sand. He spoke very slow and\r\nunder tone, scarcely audible, and at times the conversation was\r\ninterrupted by the silence of the dead. All his deportment was like that\r\nof a Sultan of these wilds; and the ancient Sheikh felt all the\r\nconsciousness of his power. The Desert Genii hedge him in around. The\r\nSultan is profoundly respected by all; and Louis-Philippe is a\r\ngingerbread Sovereign compared with Shafou of The Great Desert.\r\n\r\nBut the reader would not be prepared to find His Highness smoking his\r\npipe during our interview, and striking a light himself, the materials\r\nfor which he carried in a large leathern bag, or pouch, slung on his left\r\narm, like all the Touaricks. On taking leave, we called the servant of\r\nthe Sultan after us, and Haj Ibrahim gave into his hands a small present\r\nfor the Sultan of the value of a couple of dollars, so that I maintain my\r\nposition of also giving the best presents, in the case of the Sultan. To\r\nme it was a most pleasant and refreshing interview, after the serio-comic\r\naffair of Ouweek. I asked Haj Ibrahim what Shafou said to him. The Sultan\r\nsimply told the merchant, \"You may go to every part of the country now in\r\nsafety: to Touat, to Aheer, wherever you will--don't be afraid of the\r\nTouaricks.\" I went home with the Haj, and spent the evening with him. The\r\nmerchant determines to send eight camels of goods to Soudan. He has not\r\nsold a fourth of what he brought to this mart. A great part of the\r\nslaves, elephants' teeth, and senna which daily arrive here, are not for\r\nsale in Ghat, but are sent direct from Soudan to Tripoli by the\r\ncorrespondents of the Ghadamsee merchants at Kanou. The Ghat Souk is\r\nnearly closed, all the slaves are sold, and some of the people are\r\nthinking about returning.\r\n\r\n_28th._--Rose early and better in health. Pleased with the prospect of\r\nstill seeing my journey to Soudan completed. Weather this morning very\r\ndull, sky overcast, a few drops of rain falling. Early Sheikh Hateetah\r\nsent for me. Went and found the Consul of the English better in health.\r\nHe shewed me his scarlet burnouse and gold-braided coat, given him by our\r\nGovernment. But as his object in calling me was only to express his\r\njealousy of the other Sheikhs, and of the Sultan himself, and to beg\r\nanother present, I was by no means pleased with my visit. He evidently\r\nwished me to give him all the presents as the \"Friend\" of the English.\r\nBut this would have been both unjust and suicidal policy on my part. I\r\ncould not have considered myself safe, at any rate, respected or\r\nesteemed, unless I had given a present to all the principal personages in\r\nGhat and the surrounding districts. Hateetah besides annoyed me by saying\r\nthe route of Aheer was full of bandits, against the concurrent testimony\r\nof all the merchants. He wishes me to take the route of Bornou, which\r\nwould, entirely defeat the object I have in view, of visiting new\r\ncountries. However, by being firm with him, I got him to promise to\r\nprocure for me a letter and servant from Shafou to go on to Aheer. I am\r\nto call again in a few days, and he is to show me his seal of office,\r\ndone by the Consul-General of Tripoli. Hateetah is a man of more than\r\nsixty years, very tall, thin and attenuated, of extremely feeble frame.\r\nHe is still labouring under fever, and does not leave his pallet. To-day,\r\nhowever, he got quite energetic on the subject of the presents, having\r\nheard what a fine present the Sultan had received from me. He begged me\r\nnot to give a present to the _Oulad_ (\"people\" or \"followers\") of Shafou,\r\nmeaning thereby Khanouhen.\r\n\r\nOn my return, I found my door thronged with visitors from Berkat,\r\nthe village three miles distant, _en route_ of Soudan. They had been\r\nwaiting an hour or two for my return. At first I repulsed them, but\r\nhearing afterwards they had brought a young lad unwell, I let them\r\nin. The lad was covered with hard lumps, which had grown or festered\r\nunder his skin, about the size of a nut. He had been so for a year.\r\nI prescribed a bath and opening medicine (senna, which they can get\r\neasily), but I question if they try either. I recommended them to\r\nsend him to Tripoli, to the English doctor there, but they heard of\r\nthe proposal with horror. None of these Berkat people have ever\r\nvisited Tripoli. The Turks are their bugbear. They were not\r\nextremely friendly; rude and ignorant villagers as they were, they\r\ncould not understand why I wanted to go to Soudan. I observed they\r\nwere all well clothed and seemed to live in Saharan affluence. The\r\nterm Berkat, ‮بركت‬, signifies \"a lake\" or \"lagoon,\" and probably\r\nthe site of the oasis is the dry bottom of what was formerly a\r\nlagoon. The Berkat oasis is larger in gardens, and more fertile than\r\nGhat, but possesses the same essential features. It has no Souk, and\r\nexcites no attention from strangers visiting Ghat. The inhabitants\r\nare Saharan Moors, and some five or six hundred in number. Had a\r\nvery friendly visit from Salah, eldest son of Haj Mansour, of\r\nGhadames. He says justly, Kandarka and other camel-drivers\r\nexaggerate the dangers of the routes for their own private ends, to\r\nget more money out of me. Of the Touaricks and Ouweek, he says,\r\n\"They have no knowledge, they are bullocks.\" He also added, \"I have\r\nbeen reprimanding Ouweek for his bad conduct to you; I told him I\r\nwould not give him my usual backsheesh on account of his\r\nill-treating you.\"\r\n\r\nI am much bothered with Said. Like his master he is continually wavering,\r\nwhether he shall return to Ghadames with the return caravan, or proceed\r\nwith me. I leave him to his own choice and reflections, telling him I\r\nwill secure his freedom by writing to Sheikh Makouran. I can't but pity\r\nhim. I find him frequently in tears, or sobbing aloud, afraid the\r\nTouaricks will again make him a slave.\r\n\r\nIn the streets, I pass nearly every evening a Night-School, where there\r\nis a crowd of children all cooped up together in a small room, humming,\r\nspouting, and screaming simultaneously their lessons of the Koran, in the\r\nmanner of some of our infant schools. This mode of simultaneously\r\nrepeating a lesson has prevailed from time immemorial in the schools of\r\nNorth Africa, and I imagine, in The East likewise, and though it may be\r\nnew in England or Europe, it is old in Asia and Africa. But I never saw\r\nbefore a Night-School in Barbary, and look upon this Saharan specimen of\r\nscholastic discipline as a novelty. It is probable, in this way, every\r\nmale child of Ghat, as in Ghadames, is taught to read and write. The\r\npride of the Ghadamseeah is, that all their children read and write. The\r\nwhole population can read and write the Koran. This Saharan fact of the\r\nbarbarians of The Desert suggests painful reflections to honest-minded\r\nEnglishmen. We may boast of our liberties, our Magna Charta, our\r\nindependence of character, our commerce, our wealth, the extent of the\r\nworld which Providence (too good to us) has committed to our care. But\r\nafter all we cannot boast of what the barbarians of The Desert boast. We\r\ncannot, dare not, assert, that every male child of our population can\r\nread the Book which we call the Revelation of God! This deplorable, but\r\nundeniable fact, ought to throw suspicion upon our religious motives, as\r\nwell as our pretensions to the love and maintenance of liberty,--unless\r\nit be argued, that our liberty is founded on our want of education, and\r\nwe are free men because the half of our population cannot sign their own\r\nname! A Minister of the Crown (Earl Grey), in a late, and the last\r\ndiscussion of the House of Lords (of the old Parliament), had the\r\nhardihood, the intrepidity, to assert, that, \"We (Englishmen) were the\r\nleast educated people of Europe, nay, that we were behind the savages of\r\nNew Zealand!\" But this astounding declaration of the Minister produced no\r\nexplosion of indignation, not a single expression of regret, not a hum or\r\nmurmur of disapprobation from the Spiritual or Temporal Lords, to whom\r\nthe words of shame and censure were addressed. And, as the Lords, so the\r\nCommons, so all classes of our society. The enunciation, the reiteration\r\nof this most extraordinary, most damning stigma, on our national\r\ncharacter, does not even tinge with the most imperceptible hue of shame\r\nthe national countenance. What is the cause of all this? It is the\r\nprofound, incurable, and inextirpable bigotry of the English people, to\r\nwhich they will not hesitate to sacrifice the national honour, the public\r\nhappiness, their own liberties, and their own consciences. . . . . . . If\r\nmeasures for education are proposed by Imperial Government, our people\r\none and all will neither allow them to be adopted, nor will they\r\nthemselves adopt measures for education. With the diverse sections of our\r\nsociety, no education is education unless it be based upon their own\r\npeculiar views and principles. In this way, the curse and opprobrium of\r\nignorance are maintained in our own country.\r\n\r\nI observe that the little urchins of this Saharan School use sand in\r\ntheir first efforts to write. As sand abounds everywhere in the populated\r\noases of Sahara, and the people are poor and cannot afford to buy much\r\npaper, it is constantly employed instead of paper, pens, and ink, in\r\ncasting up accounts. I see all the Soudanese merchants casting up their\r\naccounts of barter and bargains in this way. Mostly the fore-finger is\r\nemployed, and in careless conversation a long stick or spear is used to\r\nscratch the sand. But if the subject is serious, the speaker very\r\ndistinctly marks the stops of his discourse, or illustrates it with\r\nflourishes, squares, and circles on the sand, or dust of the streets,\r\nsmoothing over the sand when he has finished. There is a little bit of\r\nsuperstition attached to this smoothing over the sand. The Moors always\r\ntell me when I write in this way to smooth all over and never forget it.\r\nThey invariably do so themselves, and never leave a mark, or stroke, or\r\ndot of the finger on the sand after they have done speaking or writing.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to hear of the peculiar mode of the Touarghee\r\nsuccession for Sultans or reigning royal Sheikhs. It is the son of\r\nthe _Sister_ of the Sultan who succeeds to the throne amongst all\r\nthe Touaricks. I have learnt since that the same custom prevails\r\namongst the Moorish tribes of the banks of the Senegal. Batouta also\r\nmentions this singular custom as prevailing amongst the Berber\r\npeople of _Twalaten_, ‮ايوالاتن‬, in Western Sahara, in these\r\nwords--\"The people call themselves after the name of their\r\nmaternal[78] uncles; it is not the sons of the fathers who inherit,\r\nbut the nephews, sons of the sister of the father.\" He adds:--\"I\r\nhave never met with this usage before, except amongst the infidels\r\nof Malabar (in India).\" It would appear, these rude children of The\r\nDesert have not sufficient confidence in the succession of father\r\nand son, and think women should not be put to so severe a test in\r\nthe propagation of a race of pure blood. Speaking to a Touarghee\r\nabout it, he said:--\"How do we know, if the son of the Sultan be his\r\nson? May he not be the son of a slave? Who can tell? But when our\r\nyoung Sultan is born from the sister of the Sultan, then we know he\r\nis of the same blood as the Sultan.\" There is besides another\r\nanomaly of the social system in the town of Ghat. Women here are the\r\nhereditary possessors and not men. The law of primogeniture is on\r\nthe female side. The greater part of the houses of the town of Ghat,\r\nalthough the population is chiefly Moorish, belong to women,\r\nbequeathed to them or given them on the day of their marriage by\r\nfriends or relatives. These two cases of anomaly are more favourable\r\nto womankind than what we mostly find in Mahometan countries. I may\r\nnot now scruple to tell the Touaricks, that the Sovereign of England\r\nis a female, for fear of giving them offence. It is a curious fact,\r\nand may here be added, that the son rarely goes, or travels, with\r\nthe father, but always is pinned to his mother's knee, or trudges\r\nalong at her side; at last, he loses all affection for his father,\r\nand concentrates his filial love on his mother. This alienation of\r\nthe son from the father, is increased by the custom of the son\r\ninheriting nothing from his father, but all through his mother.\r\n\r\n_29th._--A fine morning; the sun high in the heavens scatters light and\r\ncolour over all the Desert scene. In tolerably good spirits, but utterly\r\nat a loss which route I shall take. Visited Hateetah; he did not beg or\r\nannoy me to-day, but told me to resolve upon my route. Prescribed him\r\nsome medicine, as also for another person, who had the ill manners to\r\nsay, \"God has made the infidels to be doctors for the Faithful.\"\r\nYesterday evening, the slaves of Haj Ibrahim (about fifty) danced and\r\nsang and forgot their slavery. One young woman acted various grotesque\r\ncharacters, and, amongst the rest, _Boree_, \"The Devil.\" When a Negro\r\nsulks, or is moody, he is said to be possessed, or to have got in him\r\n_Boree_, which agrees pretty well with our \"_Blue-devils_.\" In these\r\nevening pastimes they fancy themselves in the wild woods of their native\r\nhomes, and dance and sing to the rude notes of their ruder instruments of\r\nmusic, and feel as if free and like other mortals.\r\n\r\nWent out this morning to have a commanding view of the oasis. Was\r\naccompanied by the uncle of Jabour, who took hold of my hand, and\r\npulled me on, when we mounted the neighbouring piece of rock which\r\ncommands the oasis and scenery around. From this block of mountain,\r\nnorth of the city, we had a beautiful view of the town, the oasis,\r\nand adjoining palms, and all the Desert of the Valley of Ghat. To\r\nthe south we saw the date-palms of Berkat. To the east, is the black\r\nrange of mountains, throwing sombre shadows upon the scattered\r\nsand-hills, which lie like shining heaps of silver at their base.\r\nThis range is higher than the average height of Saharan mountains.\r\nThe Touaricks say the Genii built these mountains, to protect them\r\n(the Touaricks) and their posterity from the inroads of the Turks,\r\nand Gog and Magog, from the east. \"These are,\" say they, \"our\r\neastern doors (barriers).\" Scarcely any breaks or gorges are found\r\nin this chain. Beyond the suburb, begirt with sand groups, stands\r\nthe palace of the Governor, which from hence looks like a line of\r\nfortifications, with a tower or two rising above its battlements.\r\nThere reigns, king and priest, Haj Ahmed, the lord of all he\r\nsurveys. Sahara around has a varied aspect of trees and plain, sand\r\nand mountains. The contrasts are striking, and spite the gloom of\r\nWareerat range, it is a bright desert scene. The town is small, and\r\nthe gardens are also extremely limited; the oasis is comprehended\r\nwithin a circle of not more than three or four miles. The palms are\r\ndwarfish, and half of them do not bear fruit, and their dates are of\r\nthe most ordinary kind. A sufficient proof that the date-palm is not\r\ndependent on the quality of its water, otherwise the palm of Ghat\r\nshould be the finest and its fruit the most delicious of The Sahara.\r\nOn the contrary, in some of the oases of Fezzan, where the water is\r\nliterally salt, the palm is a noble towering tree, catching the\r\nbreathings of highest heaven, and casting down most luscious fruit.\r\nHouses in Ghat have but a wretched appearance, and are as wretched\r\nwithin as without. They are not white-washed, or clean and bright\r\nand shining as Moorish houses of the coast, and though the city is\r\nsurrounded with stones, and lime is procurable, they are nearly all\r\nconstructed of sun-dried bricks and mud. A few days of incessant\r\nrain would wash many of them down. The wood of construction is, of\r\ncourse, that of the palm. The Desert furnishes no other available\r\nbuilding wood. Only one mosque tower deserves the name of minaret.\r\nBesides, there is a huge building higher than the rest, but which is\r\ninhabited as other houses. The town is walled in with walls not more\r\nthan ten feet high, but its six gates are miserably weak, and never\r\nso closed as to prevent their being opened in the night. The whole\r\ntown is built on a hill, a portion of the blocks of rock from which\r\nwe view it. This little place has one large square, called\r\n_Esh-Shelly_--‮الشلّي‬--the general rendezvous of business and\r\ngossip, and where Shafou and all the subordinate Sheikhs administer\r\njustice. Here is held the Souk, where everything important is done.\r\nBut the town-councils and state-councils of the Sheikhs are\r\ngenerally held in the open air. Two or three palms within the town\r\ncast a grateful shadow, and make an angle of the streets\r\npicturesque, but no other trees are seen. On the south, without the\r\nwalls, is a suburb of some fifty mud and stone houses. There are\r\nalso scattered over the sand, on the west, a hundred or more of\r\nhasheesh huts, made of straw and palm-branches. In the gardens,\r\nbesides the palms, a little wheat, barley, and ghusub is\r\ncultivated. There are some fruit-trees, but no vines. Of water there\r\nare several large pits, and some warm springs, but nothing\r\napproaching to the hot boiling spring of Ghadames. There is,\r\nhowever, one large reservoir, partly surrounded with palm-trees, and\r\nthe banks covered with rushes, except where the people go to draw.\r\nThe whole of this is enclosed within walls. Water apparently oozes\r\nfrom a great extent of surface. The water itself is of the first\r\nquality, and is said not to produce bile or fever. The irrigation is\r\nthe same in principle as that of Ghadames, but slaves are employed\r\nto draw up the water, whilst animals are used in Fezzan, and in\r\nGhadames the water runs itself into the gardens. The places for\r\nburying the dead around the Saharan towns occupy more space than the\r\nabodes of the living. This is not surprising, when we reflect that\r\nevery new grave occupies a new piece of ground, and many years\r\nelapse before the old grave is opened to place in it a fresh body. I\r\nsaw but one grave whitewashed; it was that of a Marabout, the only\r\n\"whitewashed sepulchre,\" and, strange enough, it is to denote\r\nsuperior priestly sanctity as in New Testament times amongst the\r\nJews. The rest were small stones heaped up in the shape of a grave,\r\na large piece of stone being placed at the head.\r\n\r\nThe style of architecture, both here and in Ghadames, is the same, except\r\nthat of Ghadames is neater and more fantastically elaborated. Most of the\r\nwalls are surmounted with a mud-plaster work, and the tops and terraces\r\nof the houses are surmounted with the same style of material, and\r\ngenerally very irregularly done, as seen in the annexed diagram. The\r\ncupboards cut out or excavated in the walls are of the shape of squares\r\nor triangles, and the windows sometimes of the same shape, but\r\noccasionally varying as seen in the diagram. All the doors and beams of\r\nthe houses, as before mentioned, are of the date-palm wood. The doors are\r\nthe usual long squares, but some of them so low that you are obliged to\r\nstoop to enter through them. This is very troublesome to the Touaricks,\r\nwho always carry their long spears with them, as we our walking-sticks. I\r\nhave noticed here in The Sahara, as well as on the coast of Barbary, very\r\ningenious wooden lock-and-keys. The key is a piece of wood six or eight\r\ninches long, and two broad, covered at one end with little pegs. The lock\r\nis fitted to these pegs by little holes. On the arrangement and fitting\r\nof these pegs and holes depend the secrecy and security of the lock. It\r\nis no easy matter at times to unlock these locks, and requires a very\r\npractised hand. The floors are covered with a thick layer of sand, even\r\nmany of the sleeping rooms, which sand is clean or dirty according to the\r\nquality and cleanliness of the occupant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAccording to my friend Mr. Colli, the original meaning of the term\r\nGhat is _Sun_ or _God_, in the Lybio-Egyptian language. The Arabic\r\nis ‮غات‬, _Ghat_, but as people fancy, like the French, they hear in\r\nthe pronunciation of the ‮غ‬ in _Ghat_ the R, so our former tourists\r\nhave sometimes written the name of the town Gh_r_at, and others\r\nGhr_aa_t. The oasis of Ghat is situated in 24° 58′ north lat., and\r\n11° 15′ east longitude.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon received a visit from Khanouhen and his brother,\r\naccompanied by Essnousee. This visit was perhaps the most friendly\r\nof all which I have received from the Touaricks. For evil or for\r\ngood, it was, at the time, the preponderating motive for attempting\r\nthe tour to Soudan. I felt more confidence in the Touaricks.\r\nKhanouhen is a man advanced in life, full fifty years of age. He has\r\nhard but intelligent features. Like all the Sheikhs, he is tall and\r\nof powerful muscular frame. His conversation consisted of a few\r\nwords, but full of pride and courage, and also to the point. He\r\nsaid:--\"I do not expect presents from a stranger who has come so far\r\nto claim my hospitality. I can give you assistance without presents.\r\nCannot the man, who is to succeed Shafou, be generous without\r\nbribes? It is not generosity to render you assistance if you load me\r\nwith presents. The heir of the Touarick Sultan receives no presents:\r\nhe asks for none. We wish not to terrify strangers--even those who\r\ndo not believe in Mahomet--by acts of extortion and plunder. I will\r\nwrite you a letter to the Sultan of Aheer, so shall Shafou, so shall\r\nHateetah. The Sultan of Aheer must respect our letters. When he does\r\nnot, we make reprisals on his people. I am now busy. I am going to\r\nexterminate the Shânbah. Our maharees will soon overtake the\r\nrobbers; not one of them shall escape. We scorn the assistance of\r\nthe Turks. We are strong enough by ourselves. We want no letters, no\r\nadvice, no arms, no horses, no guns, from the Pasha of Tripoli. All\r\nThe Desert is ours; wherever you go you find traces of our power. Be\r\nhappy here, fear nothing; for if you fear us, you lose our\r\nconfidence, and become our enemy.\" I have picked out the sense and\r\nmany of the exact expressions of this harangue, and the reader will\r\nsee that the Shereef, his son-in-law, did not exaggerate his sense\r\nand fierce eloquence. Khanouhen, indeed, is called \"The man of speech,\"\r\n‮رجل الكلام‬--by the merchants. The Sheikh was superbly\r\ndressed in the first style of the Touaricks, unlike his venerable\r\nuncle the Sultan. He wore a scarlet gold-braided coat, an immense\r\nred turban, and a huge black litham, covering the upper and lower\r\npart of his face, and nearly all his features. His arms were a\r\ndagger, a broadsword, and a ponderous bright iron spear, which on\r\nentering my apartment the Sheikh was obliged to leave outside.\r\n\r\nWeather to-day is as soft and genial as Italy. The sky is overcast this\r\nevening, and rain threatens. Yesterday I saw it lighten for the first\r\ntime in The Sahara. Flies live throughout winter here, and there is now\r\nenough of them to give annoyance. An article which I purchased to-day\r\nwill give some idea of the retail trade in Ghat. This was a barracan, of\r\nlight and fine quality, which cost me three Spanish dollars. In Tripoli,\r\nabout forty days' journey from this, it cost two mahboubs, about a dollar\r\nand three-quarters. But I purchased it for money; had it been exchanged\r\nfor goods or slaves, it would have been charged four dollars. This is\r\nnearly cent. per cent. profit. Spent the evening with Haj Ibrahim.\r\nShafou had returned the merchant's visit, and dined with him. The\r\nvenerable Sheikh does not stand upon etiquette. An affair came off\r\nto-day, which admirably and most characteristically illustrates the mode\r\nof administering justice in Ghat. Mustapha, the young merchant of\r\nTripoli, quarrelled with one of his Arabs, and came to blows. Shafou\r\nchanced to pass by at the time. His Highness immediately dispatched a\r\nservant to bring the pugilists before him. Shafou then harangued them and\r\nthe bystanders, in this spirited manner:--\"You see these men come here to\r\ndisturb our country. What ungrateful wretches they are! Shall I suffer\r\nthis? Don't I protect them? Don't I allow them to gain money at our Souk?\r\nThey return with goods and innumerable slaves to Tripoli. But they laugh\r\nat me and insult me to my face, and trample upon our hospitality,\r\n(_addressing a Sheikh_). Do you think, (_turning to the combatants_,)\r\nthere is no authority or justice in this place? I'll let you know to the\r\ncontrary. What do you think the Christian will say, if he comes and sees\r\nthis? Now, you rascals, pay me each of you ten dollars.\" This was\r\nfollowed by a violent intercession on their behalf by the foreign\r\nmerchants, some blaming one and some the other. His Highness was obliged\r\nto compromise the matter, accepting of a dollar from each. It is probable\r\nHis Highness was more anxious to inflict the penalty than quell the\r\ntumult; but I was quite unprepared for such an eloquent address from the\r\nancient patriarch of the country. Considering the great number of\r\nstrangers, there are very few quarrels. \"Ghat,\" as was said before I\r\ncame, \"is a country of peace.\" Were a bazaar of this sort held in Europe\r\n(for example an English fair), there would be a row every day, and every\r\nhour of the day. Nevertheless, this does not prevent us from calling\r\nthese Saharan people barbarians.\r\n\r\n_30th._--Very mild weather this morning, but overcast as if rain would\r\nsoon fall. I have not been long enough in The Desert to read the weather\r\nsigns, or become weather-wise. Keep the door shut, to prevent an influx\r\nof visitors. Now and then a few people get in. Whilst eating my supper\r\nthis evening, I was surprised at the appearance of two little ragged\r\nboys. I asked what they wanted, they returned, \"Eat, eat, we want to\r\neat.\" I went out to see them, for they stood on the terrace in the dark.\r\nHere I found one of the audacious urchins flourishing a spear ten times\r\nas big as himself, menacing me with it. I pushed the little scoundrels\r\ndown stairs into the street. I could not however help remarking upon\r\ntheir audacity, and the early infant habits of Touarghee \"begging by\r\nforce.\" The Ghadamsee people have always been the fair game of the\r\nTouaricks. Asking one day a Ghadamsee, \"What occupation the Touaricks\r\nfollowed?\" he replied indignantly, \"Beg, beg, beg, this is their trade!\r\nWhen they get money, they bury it, and beg, beg, beg!\" This perhaps, is\r\noverstated, still it is curious to witness this first lesson of \"we want\r\nto eat,\" repeated by children of very tender age, with a tone of command\r\nand insolence. Khanouhen does not send for his present, and I hear, he\r\nwill not receive presents. I shall have the more to give away at Aheer.\r\n\r\n_31st._--Fine morning. I am surprised at my simplicity; but, apparently,\r\nthe only thing which I enjoy with pure feelings, is the song of the\r\nlittle birds, the _boohabeeba_, which frequent my terrace and the\r\nhouse-top, as sparrows familiarly in England. With these I feel I can\r\nhold free converse and interchange an unadulterated sympathy. The\r\ninnocent little creatures remind me of my days of childhood, when I\r\nrevelled in the woods and corn-fields of Lincolnshire, listening to the\r\nsong of birds in early fresh spring morn, or bright summer day. Here was\r\nthe tender chord of childhood associations touched, and no wonder that\r\nmemory should come in to the aid of sympathy in these unsympathizing\r\ndeserts. How little at times contents the heart, and fills the aching\r\nvacuum of the mind! In this we cannot fail to see an arrangement of\r\ninfinite wisdom. If only great things could satisfy the mind of man, how\r\nprodigiously our miseries would be increased, for how few are the things\r\ndeserving to be called great! Called this morning on Hateetah. Put him in\r\na better humour, by telling him I would give him an extra present. On\r\nreturning, stopped at a stall, where were exposed for sale, onions,\r\ntrona, dates, and other things. The women immediately caught alarm,\r\nafraid I was going to throw a glance of \"the evil eye\" on their little\r\nproperty. They cried out, \"There is one God, and Mahomet is the prophet\r\nof God!\" I made off quick enough from this unseemly uproar. Saw\r\nafterwards the Governor. Called to ask him to allow his servants to make\r\nme some cuscasou, which request his Excellency granted immediately. He\r\nsaid:--\"In travelling to Soudan adopt the dress of the Ghadamsee\r\nmerchants, and let your beard grow.\" The Governor refuses to say anything\r\nof Kandarka. Probably they have quarrelled. Our merchants give the\r\nTibboos a bad character, and the caravans are afraid of them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] Amongst the Servians the mother's brother was \"a very\r\n    important personage.\" Ranke says:--\"Amongst the early Germans,\r\n    families were held together by a peculiar preference on the\r\n    mother's side; the mother's brother being, according to ancient\r\n    custom, a very important personage. In the Sclavonic-Servian\r\n    tribe, there prevails, to a greater extent, a strong and lively\r\n    feeling of brotherly and sisterly affection; the brother is proud\r\n    of having a sister; the sister swears by the name of her\r\n    brother.\"--(_See_ Mrs. Alexander Kerr's admirable translation of\r\n    Ranke's _Servian History, &c._, chap. iv., p. 56.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nABANDON THE TOUR TO SOUDAN.\r\n\r\n     Violent Act of a Touarick on Slaves.--Visit to the Princess Lilla\r\n     Fatima.--Mode of grinding Corn.--Dilatoriness of Commercial\r\n     Transactions.--Grandees of Ghat Town.--Khanouhen refuses his\r\n     Present.--Rumours of the Conquest of Algeria spread throughout\r\n     Africa.--Small Breed of Animals in Sahara.--Queer circumstance of\r\n     unearthly Voices.--The Cold becomes intense.--Arrival of Sheikh\r\n     Berka.--Hateetah in good Humour.--My Targhee friend, Sidi\r\n     Omer.--Visit from Kandarka; his Character.--Visit to the aged\r\n     Berka, and find the Giant.--Hateetah's Political Gossips.--At a\r\n     loss which Route to take, and how to proceed.--Superstitions\r\n     connected with the Butcher.--Zeal of an old Hag against The\r\n     Christian.--Out of Humour.--Reported departure of\r\n     Caravans.--Jabour calls with a Patient.--Visit Bel Kasem, and\r\n     find Khanouhen.--Political Factions of Azgher Touaricks.--Giants\r\n     in The Desert.--Fanciful analogies of origin of\r\n     Peoples.--Hierarchy of the Sheikhs.--Population, Arms, and\r\n     Military Forces of the Ghat Touaricks.--The Mahry or\r\n     Maharee.--Camels named from their Fleetness.--Touarghee Court of\r\n     Justice.--Amphitheatrical style of Touaricks lounging.--Amount of\r\n     Customs-Dues paid by Ghat Traders.--Free Trade in Sahara.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1st January, 1846._--YESTERDAY I saw two slaves, both of whom had gashes\r\non their arms and legs, the blood flowing from one poor fellow profusely.\r\nI asked,\r\n\r\n\"Who has done this?\"\r\n\r\n_The Slaves._--\"A Touarghee.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" I continued.\r\n\r\n_The Slaves._--\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI found afterwards the slaves were doing some work in the gardens which\r\nthe Touarghee thought should have been given to him. Touaricks seldom get\r\ninto passion, but when the blood boils the dagger is immediately had\r\nrecourse to for the arrangement of their quarrels. The Touaricks have\r\nmany slaves, but male slaves, for they rarely mix their blood with the\r\nnegro race. Called upon Hateetah with his extra present of four dollars'\r\nvalue. He then began in an excited humour, \"To-morrow come to me, Shafou\r\nwill be here. We must arrange to send a maharee to the English Sultan.\" I\r\nsuggested his brother should take it to Tripoli. He sprung up from his\r\nbed with joy, \"Yes, good, Shafou and I will arrange everything. Nobody\r\nelse must come here but you. It must be all done in secret.\" Hateetah is\r\nfrightened of Khanouhen, and knows the Sultan has no will of his own\r\nunless kept apart from that powerful prince. Touaricks, when something is\r\nto be had, soon gets excited, like the rest of us.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, Said and I carried the present for Khanouhen to the prince's\r\nhouse. I spoke to the Governor, who recommended me, by all means,\r\nnotwithstanding the Sheikh's protestations, to send him a handsome\r\npresent. I submitted to the Governor's opinion. Khanouhen resides in some\r\napartments of the Governor's palace; this is the prince's town residence.\r\nWe were conducted to the apartment of his lady, Lilla Fatima, (the prince\r\nbeing out,) by her nephews. Her Royal Highness received us courteously,\r\nand the interview was extremely amusing. I began by apologizing for the\r\ntop of \"the head of sugar[79]\" being broken off. This made the lady\r\nalmost faint. \"What!\" she protestingly exclaimed, \"Khanouhen is The Great\r\nSultan! Shafou is compared to him like the sand! (taking up a little\r\nsand from the floor and scattering it about with her hands.) My husband\r\nis lord and master of all the Touaricks. He has the word ready; from his\r\nlips, all the Touaricks, all the merchants, all the strangers, all the\r\nChristians who come here, receive their commands and instantly obey them.\r\nAnd you bring him a loaf of sugar with the head knocked off! Oh, this is\r\nnot pretty! This is not right, and I am afraid for your sake.\" I pleaded\r\ninability to find another loaf this morning, but promised to bring one\r\nto-morrow. Her Royal Highness then begged for more things. \"You see the\r\n_grunfel_ (cloves) is not for me; it is for Khanouhen's other wife in the\r\ncountry. Khanouhen will take it all away to her, and leave me none. Now\r\nyou must, indeed, bring me some _grunfel_.\" I then recommended her to get\r\nit divided, at which she laughed heartily, adding, \"Ah, Khanouhen likes\r\nher in the country better than me.\" I then put Her Royal Highness in a\r\ngood humour by telling her I would send her some beads, and if I should\r\nreturn to Tripoli, and come back to Ghat, I would bring her several\r\npresents. She added, \"My husband Khanouhen related to me all the things\r\nwhich you intended to give him, which you showed him in your room. Also,\r\nyou said you would give him a little lock and key, where is it?\"\r\n\r\nThis I had not brought with me, thinking the Sheikh would not accept of\r\nsuch a trifling thing, but I was mistaken. The Touaricks will take\r\neverything you offer them, and not hurt your self-complacency of\r\nconferring a favour by refusal. I must finish with this lady, whose\r\ntongue ran along at a tremendous rate, by adding, that to show her regard\r\nfor me, (and for herself likewise, wishing me to return to Tripoli to\r\nfetch her some nice presents,) her Royal Highness gave me this advice:\r\n\"For God's sake don't go to Soudan. You'll die there soon. How can you, a\r\nChristian, live there with such a white skin? The people who go there are\r\nall black, and have large swollen faces, (imitating them by blowing out\r\nher cheeks,) they are puffed out and nasty, they become as ugly as the\r\ndevil himself.\" The town wife and lady of the Sheikh, who is\r\nheir-apparent to the Touarghee throne of Ghat, is herself a comely\r\nbustling body, rather stout, of middle size, about thirty-five years of\r\nage; and were she dressed in European style, she might, with her fine\r\nblack eyes, look as well as some of our courtly dames. Her Royal Highness\r\nhad nothing on but a plain Soudan black cotton gown, with short sleeves,\r\nand a light woollen barracan, as a sort of shawl, wrapped round her\r\nshoulders, partly covering her head. She had a few charms and some\r\ncoloured beads adorning the neck; two gold bracelets on her wrist, and\r\ntwo thick hoops of silver round her ancles. A pair of coloured-leather\r\nsandals, made in Soudan, were bound on her feet. She had no colour, save\r\nthe usual sallow of Moorish ladies, on her cheek, but she had no\r\ndisfigurement of tattooing or other marks upon her, so common in Saharan\r\nbeauties.\r\n\r\nAfter the delivery of the present I called to see the Governor, the\r\nlady's brother. Told him of my sudden resolution of abandoning the\r\njourney to Soudan the present year. He highly approved of my resolution,\r\nand seemed relieved of a great embarrassment, for, although very cautious\r\nin what he said, he always considered himself responsible more or less\r\nfor my safety. I found his Excellency, but not to my surprise,\r\npurchasing half a dozen slaves, young lads. The Marabout merchant does\r\nnot scruple to deal in human beings. The fact is, his Excellency scruples\r\nat no kind of trade, by which he may \"turn a penny,\" or \"save a penny.\"\r\nReturned home and wrote to Tripoli; but when the letter was finished the\r\ncourier was gone. As often happens, was glad afterwards the letter did\r\nnot go.\r\n\r\nThe mode of grinding corn here, if I may use the term grinding, is of the\r\nmost primitive character possible. It is nothing more or less than\r\nrubbing the corn between two stones, the lower stone being large and\r\nsmoothed off on its surface, with an inclined plane, and the upper stone\r\nvery small compared to the lower. Thus--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA small basket catches the meal as it falls off, or is pushed off by the\r\nperson, who holds the upper stone in his hands, and works it up and down\r\nover the surface of the lower stone. Slaves and women so grind wheat,\r\nbarley, ghusub, &c. The meal is scarcely ever winnowed. In Aheer, a large\r\nwooden pestle and mortar are used for grinding, rather pounding, the\r\ncorn. The slaves living with me have a huge wooden pestle and mortar, and\r\nwe frequently use it. It requires great tact in the pounding, otherwise\r\nthe grain will be continually flying out. I pounded dates with it, which\r\nwith a little olive oil, and roasted grain pounded with them, adding a\r\nfew grains of Soudan pepper and a little dry cheese, make very nice\r\ncake, or it is esteemed nice cake in Ghat. Corn and ghusub are given to\r\nday-labourers instead of money. A slave will have about a quarter of a\r\npeck of barley, or other grain, given him for a day's work; occasionally\r\nis added to it, a few dates or a little liquid butter: on this he must\r\nlive.\r\n\r\nThe Souk of Ghat, thank heaven, is nearly closed. The business, which has\r\nbeen transacted here during the last month, would have been done in\r\nEngland in one or two days at most. But our Saharan merchants are\r\ndetermined to do everything, _be-shwaiah, be-shwaiah_, \"by little and by\r\nlittle.\" The greatest trial of patience for an European merchant\r\nfrequenting this Souk would be the dilatoriness with which commercial\r\ntransactions are carried on. A month usually passes before the Souk\r\nopens, and six weeks more are consumed before a merchant can or will get\r\noff, although, as his merchandize consists chiefly of slaves, his delay\r\nis all against himself, eating him up and his profits. The details of the\r\ntraffic are really curious. A slave is heard of one day, talked about the\r\nnext, searched out the day after, seen the next, reflections next day,\r\nprice fixed next, goods offered next, squabblings next, bargain upset\r\nnext, new disputes next, goods assorted next, final arrangement next,\r\ngoods delivered and exchanged next, &c., &c., and the whole of this\r\nmelancholy exhibition of a wrangling cupidity over the sale of human\r\nbeings is wound up by the present of a few parched peas, a few Barbary\r\nalmonds, and a little tobacco being given to the Soudanese merchants, the\r\nparties separating with as much self-complacency, as if they had arranged\r\nthe mercantile affairs of all Africa.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--Visited this evening Hateetah. He says, the Sultan and himself\r\nwill call upon me to-morrow, and arrange the present which is to be sent\r\nto Her Majesty. Afterwards called upon the Governor, to ask him where Haj\r\nAbdullah of Bengazi resided. He leaves for Fezzan in eight or ten days,\r\nand has offered to take me with him. Called afterwards on Mohammed Kafah.\r\nFound him friendly, but he, assisted by his brother, began again to annoy\r\nme about Mahomet, Paradise, and hell-fire. I told them, \"All good people,\r\nwhatever their creed, must be blessed with the favour of God. Such was\r\nthe native sentiment in all our hearts.\" Kafah said, \"Many English have\r\nturned Mussulmans.\" I told him very few, and those mostly\r\ngood-for-nothing runaways. He asked why we did not repeat their formula?\r\nI told him we all did the first part, \"There is but one God;\" but the\r\nsecond was prohibited by Christians. I left them very angry. It is next\r\nto impossible to induce Saharan Mahometans to think favourably of\r\nChristianity. If Christianity ever be propagated here, it must be through\r\nthe means of youth and children. The merchants Kafah and Tunkana, the\r\nKady Tahar, and Haj Ahmed the Governor, are the knot of personages and\r\ngrandees in this little Saharan town. All the rest are sorry traders,\r\ncamel-drivers, and slaves. The Touaricks are only town visitors, and\r\nalways retire to their country districts at the close of the periodic\r\nmarts.\r\n\r\nWeather to-day is excessively cold, the wind blowing from the north-east.\r\nEverybody is frightened at the wind, and there is no Souk, or market,\r\ntill very late. I myself feel the cold extremely, so I am not surprised\r\nto see the Soudanese people all shut up in their houses crowding over a\r\nsmoking fire, with the rooms full of smoke, and nearly suffocating the\r\ninmates.\r\n\r\nTo my great surprise, and contrary to every expectation, Prince Khanouhen\r\nhas sent his present back in a great rage, not directly, indeed, to me,\r\nbut to my neighbour Bel-Kasem, saying, with a thousand different remarks,\r\nembellished with oaths, \"I will not accept of such a miserable present.\"\r\nBel Kasem calls upon me in a prodigious fright, prostrate under the ire\r\nof the incensed Chieftain, and thus pleads in his favour: \"Khanouhen\r\nconsiders himself a greater Sheikh even than Shafou the Sultan. He is\r\ngreatly dissatisfied with so small a present; increase it a little for\r\nGod's sake--if you are going to Soudan, you must add something\r\nconsiderable: if not, just a little to pacify him. Khanouhen has got a\r\nlarge belly; pray satisfy him, for he can do more for you than any other\r\nSheikh in Ghat. Indeed, Khanouhen is very angry with you for sending him\r\nsuch a trifle, and for taking it to his wife. Why did you take the\r\npresent to his wife? Now, take my advice: the Sheikh just dropped out, if\r\nyou will give him ten dollars in money, he will send you the present of\r\ngoods back. Send him only the value of the goods in money, and then he\r\nwill be satisfied. Khanouhen has got a stomach bigger than that of all\r\nthe Sheikhs. He rages against you like fire: satisfy him for Heaven's\r\nsake.\"\r\n\r\nI immediately sent back Bel Kasem to find the Sheikh, and to propose to\r\nhim to take back the goods, and give him money instead, or add a little\r\nmoney to the goods. So then this is the great bravado of Khanouhen, that\r\nhe could not soil his fingers by taking presents! I expect I shall soon\r\nbe stripped. There are, unfortunately, so many Sheikhs, that to give\r\nhandsome presents to them all, would amount to a large sum. A burning\r\njealousy rankles in their breasts about these Souk presents. Each wishes\r\nto be the greater man, in order to have more presents, though all\r\nacknowledge Shafou on the principle of \"right divine,\" or \"the right of\r\nthe Genii.\" There is a controversy going on about Haj Ibrahim, as to\r\nwhich of the Sheikhs is his friend, or protector, to whom he is to send\r\nhis little present of tribute. Of course I feel extremely annoyed and\r\ndisheartened to have a quarrel of this sort with the man who has the\r\ngreatest influence in the country. But I must hold out, since my\r\nsituation is not yet desperate. As something agreeable, in counterpoise,\r\nI may mention that Haj Ibrahim, on visiting the Sultan, found His\r\nHighness reclining on the carpet-rug which I gave him. His Highness said\r\nto the merchant, smiling with satisfaction, \"See, this is what The\r\nChristian gave me.\" It is the present given to the Sultan which has\r\nexcited the jealous indignation of his nephew. But the Sheikhs have\r\nbroken through the rule, or I have myself, for Hateetah only has the\r\nright of a present from me.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--A fine morning, and warmer, but the wind is still high. Over the\r\nopen desert is a sort of a dirty-red mist, which people tell me is the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nSince Shafou and Hateetah did not come this morning as promised, I called\r\non Hateetah to know the reason. Hateetah had a cold in his eyes, and\r\ncould not go out. He added, \"Shafou is busy in enrolling troops for the\r\nShânbah expedition.\" Hateetah had many visitors whilst I was there. A\r\nGhatee, to my surprise, asked me, \"How long slaves would be allowed to be\r\nsold in Tripoli?\" I answered, \"Some time yet.\" He had heard of my being\r\nconnected with abolition. Another, just returned from Soudan, said:--\"The\r\npeople of Soudan say the Emperor of Morocco has taken possession of\r\nAlgeria.\" I was unprepared for such a rumour in the heart of Africa, and\r\ncoming from The South, instead of going to The South. Of this\r\nirregularity the Saharan newsmongers never think. But the fact is, the\r\nconquest of Algeria by a powerful Christian nation is felt in every part\r\nof The Desert, and reaches the farthest peregrinations of the merchants.\r\nThese wars and rumours of wars, however, are turned whenever possible in\r\nfavour of the Mussulmans. It is probable the attempted invasion of Oran\r\nby the son of the Emperor, was immediately transformed into the conquest\r\nof that province by desert reports. Another person asked me, \"Whether the\r\nGovernment of Constantinople was that of the Sultan himself, or the\r\nChristians?\" I observed:--\"The Sultan's Government is very much\r\ninfluenced by Christian Powers.\" It has long been the opinion of Barbary\r\nMoors, that the late Sultan Mahmoud was a Greek in the disguise of a\r\nMussulman; and the same stigma sticks to his son. This opinion has\r\nacquired strength and obtained general currency by the European reforms\r\nwhich the Ottomans have lately introduced into their administration. Many\r\nquestions of this kind were asked, and, in the presence of Hateetah when\r\nno insolence would be tolerated, the people seemed less bigoted. This is\r\nthe advantage of having an English agent, if possible, in these remote\r\ndistricts, like Hateetah. Passing through the gardens, I saw some horses\r\nand bullocks, and was surprised at their dwarfish dimensions. In Central\r\nAfrica, horses are frequently found of a very dwarfish breed. The horses\r\nwere unwhisped and sorry-looking ponies, with their bellies pinched in.\r\nThe bullocks cut an equally queer figure. I have noticed that fowls here\r\nare very small, but very lively, catching the fire of a long Saharan\r\nsummer. The cocks, which are so many bantams, are indeed all fire,\r\nattacking you with fierceness. Two of the Governor's sons called at noon.\r\nOne flourished a spear, which he said was \"to beat Christians with.\" I\r\npushed him out of my apartment down stairs. With such customers it is the\r\nonly plan. Another son called a short time afterwards, and asked me to\r\nlend him three dollars, which, of course, I refused. His Excellency knows\r\nnothing of the tricks of these young gentlemen, or they would soon be put\r\nto rights. Two Arabs, just returned from Soudan, called and said:--\"Go to\r\nSoudan, there's not much sickness, go _viâ_ Aheer. The road _viâ_ Bornou\r\nis not safe now.\" This is what I conjectured, after hearing of the\r\nskirmishes and the retreat of the son of Abd-el-Geleel before the Turks\r\nup to Bornou.\r\n\r\nLate this evening, on descending to the lower rooms of the house, which\r\nwere nearly dark, very little light indeed penetrating the lower part of\r\nthe house at any time of the day, I found the street-door open, and two\r\nlong huge figures scarcely visible in the gloom, standing up against the\r\nwall on opposite sides of the large room. I retreated back a few paces in\r\nalarm. The slaves were all out, as also Said. Presently I heard two gruff\r\nvoices begin from the different parts of the room, in long and measured\r\nand doleful accents. One repeated, \"There is no God but God, and Mahomet\r\nis the prophet of God.\" The words were repeated very slowly and\r\nsolemnly, and at considerable intervals, \"La - - lillah - -\r\nella - - ellaha - - wa - - Mo-ham-med - - ra-soul - - ellaha!\" The other\r\nvoice uttered in equally grave and solemn accents, \"Bor-nou-se! Bor-nou-se!\r\nBor-nou-se!\" The first voice appalled me, for I did not know but what I\r\nwas going to receive the stroke of a dagger through the deep gloom, in\r\ncase of my refusing to comply with repeating the Mahometan formula, or\r\nconfession of faith; but the second voice reassured me, I felt the\r\nparties were begging in the style of Ouweek, \"Your money or your life.\" I\r\nbesides recognized at once the parties to be some low fellows of the\r\nTouaricks. The street-door was wide open, though no one was passing by.\r\nAs soon as I could distinguish the import of these strange unearthly\r\nvoices, which seemed to rise from the ground like the mutterings of the\r\nwizard, I saw the only course before me was, as all the servants were\r\nabsent, to rush out into the street. I made a spring right by one of the\r\nTouaricks, leaving a portion of my slight woollen bornouse caught by the\r\nhilt of his dagger. I went off to Haj Ibrahim, but said nothing about it,\r\nnot knowing correctly what might have been the intentions of the\r\nTouaricks. I always found the Touaricks displeased, even the Sheikhs,\r\nwhen any complaints were made against them. Shafou, himself, always told\r\nme, \"My people will be as kind to you as I am,\" and would not hear of\r\ncomplaints. I comprehended the course before me, and complained of no\r\none. On my return home I heard nothing, and said nothing. I took the\r\nprecaution, however, of not allowing Said to leave the house when the\r\nGovernor's slaves were out. I may mention now, that Ouweek's affair was\r\nentirely smuggled up, and never even alluded to by the Sultan or\r\nKhanouhen. The policy of Khanouhen is not to allow a suspicion of this\r\nsort to be whispered abroad. In his own words:--\"We are hospitable, we\r\nare men of honour, of one word, and we cannot commit a dastardly action.\"\r\nThe reader will hereafter see the result, so far as my visit amongst the\r\nTouaricks was concerned.\r\n\r\n_4th._--Awfully cold this morning, and can scarcely bear my miserable\r\napartment, which affords very little shelter from the wind and cold,\r\nhaving neither door nor window-holes closed up. No one to be seen in the\r\nstreets; all \"struck upon a heap\" with the cold, and shut up in the\r\nhouses. At noon, when the sun began to be felt, went out to see Bel\r\nKasem, and was pleased to hear that Khanouhen would compound with me, and\r\nreceive five or six dollars in cash, instead of the present. The sugar\r\nand cloves, beads and looking-glasses were not to be returned, but to be\r\nleft for the Sheikh's ladies. I felt much relieved; it was not very\r\npleasant to be in a contest with the actual Sultan of the country.\r\n\r\nBerka, the most aged and venerable Sheikh of the great families, arrived\r\nyesterday from his district, bringing with him numerous followers.\r\n\r\nCalled upon Hateetah, and gave him an additional present, the whole now\r\namounting to eight dollars. He is, of course, in a very good humour, and\r\nconsiders I have treated him like the English Consul. He proposed to me\r\nthat I should get him officially appointed British Consul by the Queen.\r\nHis pretensions are not exorbitant; he would be contented with fifty\r\ndollars a year. He might be useful. The difficulty would be official\r\ncorrespondence. The Touarghee Consul would be obliged to employ an Arabic\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nMy young and kind Touarghee friend Sidi Omer, called this afternoon. He\r\nis more like an English acquaintance of years' standing than a Desert\r\nTouarghee whom I saw but yesterday. I asked him to take cuscasou with me.\r\nHe observed, \"No, that must not be; a little sugar I'll take, a little\r\nperfume for my wife I'll take, but I must not eat your cuscasou, for you\r\nare a stranger. You ought to eat my cuscasou. The Touaricks must not eat\r\nthe cuscasou of strangers, and so friendly like you.\" I offered to take\r\nhim with me to Tripoli. He answered, \"No, not now, I must first go and\r\nfight the Shânbah. Then I'll return and come to you in Tripoli, God\r\nwilling; nay, I'll visit you in your country, and you shall show me your\r\nSheikh.\" In fact, this young man is free from those fanatical prejudices\r\ndisfiguring so many of his countrymen. He is most amiable and gentle, too\r\ngentle for these Saharan wilds. Occasionally he escorts me about the\r\ntown, and always keeps off the rabble. After my friend, Kandarka called\r\non me. I did not know the fellow, he having twisted a white turban round\r\nhis head. Strange, this Aheer camel-driver visited me before I called\r\nupon him and sent for him, and when he came I did not recognize him\r\nagain, on account of his assuming such Protean shapes. To-day I was much\r\npleased with his intelligence and the frankness of his conversation. I\r\nopened my journal, and showed him his name written in it, that he might\r\nsee, if I did not recognize him, yet he occupied my attention, for his\r\nname was already inscribed with Christian letters in my book. He was so\r\ndelighted, at the sight of his name in the book, that he sprung up, made\r\na summerset on the terrace, took up his sword and flourished it in the\r\nair, and then sat down again, staring and grinning in my face as if he\r\nhad been imbibing laughing gas. There is more negro blood and negro\r\nantics in him than the ordinary Touaricks of Aheer. He represents Noufee\r\nas a great country of trade, and inhabited by Pagans and Mohammedans.\r\nKandarka introduced religion, but finding the English prayed and\r\nacknowledged a God, he was satisfied and dropped the subject.\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"English, pray?\" (bending his forehead to the ground.)\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"Sultan English, cut off plenty heads,\" (making a stroke\r\nwith a sword).\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"Sultan English, plenty wives has he,\" (making an indecent\r\nsign).\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"English women, plenty fat--big all round,\" (describing a\r\nlady's bustle).\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.\"\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"English, slaves, slaves!\"\r\n\r\n(I shake my head.)\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"How? How?\"\r\n\r\n(I shake my head.)\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"Come to Aheer with me, I fear no one. You fear no one when\r\nyou come with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't fear any one but God.\"\r\n\r\n_Kandarka._--\"G-- it's the truth!\" (seizing hold of my hands to embrace\r\nme.)\r\n\r\nI cannot but lament my feeble powers, to depict the character of my\r\nvarious visitors, and to represent their ideas in English. I am obliged\r\nto be content with a bald outline of their characters, and a miserable\r\ntranslation of their thoughts into English dress. This Kandarka is in\r\nhimself a complete character, and a study for the tourist.\r\n\r\nThis evening paid a visit to Berka, the most aged Sheikh. It was dark\r\nwhen I arrived at his date-branch hut. I entered; it was a large\r\nenclosure. I found the aged Sheikh with several of his brothers, and they\r\nand their children sitting round a flickering fire. One of them was\r\ndressed in white. I asked the reason. The Sheikh told me he was a\r\nMarabout. The French Government writers of Algeria have distinguished\r\nTouaricks into white and black Touaricks, from the white and black\r\nclothes which they are said to wear. I never heard of this distinction.\r\nNow and then I have seen a Touarick dressed in white cottons, or\r\nwoollens; it seemed to be a matter of caprice. All dress in black and\r\nblue-black cottons of Soudan; it is the national colour. And here we have\r\na new case of contrarieties in Mussulman nations living near neighbours,\r\nfor the Moors and Arabs detest black as much as the Touaricks admire\r\nblack. The Touaricks seem to have caught the infection from the colour of\r\ntheir country, which is intersected with ranges of black mountains. In\r\none of the early skirmishes of the French in Algeria, an officer\r\ndescribes the appearance of the enemy, as covering the mountain's side,\r\nwhence they sallied, with a white mantle, the Arabs were so thick and\r\ntheir burnouses so white. Berka was very gentle and affable, like every\r\nman of a good old age. \"You are welcome in this country,\" he addressed\r\nme; \"this is a country of peace.\" Whilst conversing with the old Sheikh,\r\nI heard a gruff heavy whisper from the farther end of the hut,\r\n_Hash-Hālik_, \"How do you do?\" I turned round, and to my no small\r\nastonishment, I saw the Giant Touarick, stretched along the full length\r\nof the very large hut, sweltering in the fulness of his might. The reader\r\nwill remember the honourable mention made of The Giant in Ghadames. He\r\nthen raised up his massy head and Atlantean chest, and put out his brawny\r\nsinewy arm, and clenched my hand: \"Yâkob, the Shânbah have murdered my\r\nlittle son, _they_ are the enemies of man and God, not _you_ Christians.\r\nI am going to cut them all to pieces. Last year I killed eight with my\r\nown good sword. When you come back from Soudan, you will not hear any\r\nmore even the name of the Shânbah.\" The Giant groaned out this in bad\r\nArabic. He was greatly afflicted for the loss of his son. The Shânbah\r\nbrigands fell upon a troop of Touaricks, in whose care he had left his\r\nlittle son, a child of very tender age, I presented Berka with a fine\r\nlarge white turban, and we parted good friends. The Giant is the nephew\r\nof Berka.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Called upon Hateetah. He had, as usual, many visitors.\r\nConversation turned upon politics. They were anxious to know the relative\r\namount of the military forces of the nations of Europe, and of the\r\nStamboul Sultan. I always tell them France has plenty of money and\r\ntroops. This keeps down their boasting, for the French are near, and they\r\nare alarmed, and they think, as an Englishman, I must tell the truth when\r\nI praise the French. If I abused the French they might suspect me, but I\r\nhave no inclination to do so. At the same time, I'll defy any traveller\r\nto write fairly and justly upon the late history of North Africa, without\r\nfilling his pages with _bonâ fide_ and well-founded abuse of the French\r\nand their works in this part of the world. They emphatically stink\r\nthroughout Africa. Hateetah vexed me by begging a _backsheesh_ for his\r\nbrothers. I positively refused; there's no end to making presents. All\r\nthe Sheikhs, as Bel Kasem Said of Khanouhen, have \"a large belly.\" On\r\nreturning home, I determined to keep the door shut to prevent people\r\ncoming to annoy me. Now that I have no sugar or dates left, I have\r\nnothing wherewith to get rid of them. Every visitor who leaves me,\r\nwithout a small present, however trifling it may be, considers himself\r\ninsulted by me, or that I don't like him.\r\n\r\nStill at a loss to know what to do, whether to proceed to Soudan, or\r\nreturn and finish my tour of the Mediterranean. Sometimes I fancy I'll\r\ntoss up, and then, checking my folly, I'll try the _sortes sanctorum_; a\r\nfeather would turn the scale. On such miserable indecision hangs the fate\r\nof man!\r\n\r\nBought half a sheep for a Spanish dollar. It's not much of a bargain, for\r\nit is one of the Soudan species, and very thin and bony. Touarick flocks\r\nare nearly all this kind of sheep. When the Arab, who was \"halves with\r\nme,\" divided the carcase, he took two pieces of wood, and then sent Said\r\ndown stairs. One of the pieces he gave me, and the other he kept. He now,\r\ntaking back my piece, called Said to return, and told him to put each\r\npiece of wood on each half of the sheep. My piece determined my half, and\r\nhis piece his half. This is the Arab _sortes sanctorum_. The butcher had\r\nsprinkled his hayk with the blood, a drop or two were on it, and he was\r\ndistressed to wash them out lest they should prevent him saying his\r\nprayers. A portion of the entrails, the spleen, he applied to his eyes as\r\na talisman for their preservation.\r\n\r\nThere is an old woman very fond of annoying me; let us suppose she must\r\nbe a witch; she always calls out after me when I pass her stall, \"There\r\nis but one God and Mahomet is the prophet of God.\" To-day, words would\r\nnot suffice; the old hag ran after me and thumped me over the back, to\r\nshow her zeal for Mahomet, who, begging pardon of his Holiness, has not,\r\nafter all, been so very kind to the ladies in his religion, unless it be\r\nthe compliment which he has paid them, by placing all the imaginable\r\nfelicity of Paradise in their embraces. I took no notice of the virago. I\r\nfind it's no use. I was glad, however, to hear she was not Touarick, and\r\nonly a Billingsgate Mooress of the place. I am also happy to tell my fair\r\nreaders, she was not fair but very ugly. A large party of people followed\r\nme home, hooting me, to give them something to eat. This rabble fancies\r\nthey have the right to insult a Christian, unless he gives them something\r\nto eat or to wear. To bear all this, and ten thousand little delicate\r\nattentions of the rabble of Ghat, requires, as Mr. Fletcher hints,\r\n\"Conciliation,\" with an occasional dose, I should think, of that most\r\nnecessary of all Saharan equipments, in travelling through The Desert.\r\nPATIENCE.\r\n\r\n_6th._--Sulky with the insolence of the rabble, and determined not to go\r\nout till the evening. A brother or cousin of Hateetah called to beg, and\r\nbeing in a bad humour, I told him I was just going round the town to ask\r\nfor a few presents myself, in return for those I had given to the people.\r\nHe was not abashed, but answered, \"Good, good.\" He waited half an hour in\r\nsilence, for I got to my writing, and went off much pleased, I should\r\nimagine, with his visit. One of the slaves of the Governor came in, and\r\nsaid sharply, \"What's that fellow _douwar_ (_i. e._ go about seeking)?\"\r\n\"He wants you to give him some of your _gusub_ (grain.)\" \"_Kelb_\" (dog),\r\nhe replied. This slave himself was a brazen-faced beggar, and a bit of a\r\nthief, but withal a droll fellow. I asked him how he was captured? He\r\nanswered, naïvely, \"You know Fezzan, you know Ghat;--well, these two\r\ncountries make the war, and catch me a boy.\" \"How do you like Haj Ahmed,\r\nyour master?\" \"He has plenty wives, plenty children: we slaves must\r\nplenty work for all these. Now, I like to eat. Haj Ahmed, he Governor,\r\nbut he gives me nothing to eat. I work for him six hours--I work for\r\nothers six hours. The people give me to eat, not Haj Ahmed.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the character of slave-labour in Ghat. The masters have half of\r\ntheir labour for nothing, or because they are their slaves: with the rest\r\nof their labour they support themselves. The _meum et tuum_ is not, and\r\nindeed cannot be very strictly observed by the poor people who have to\r\nsupport such a precarious existence; and when Said went down to bring up\r\nthe meat to cook for supper, he found this young gentleman had carried it\r\nnearly all off to cook for his own supper, leaving what remained for us\r\nto make the best of.\r\n\r\nIt is now reported that every stranger will leave Ghat in five or six\r\ndays, one ghafalah going to the south, another to the north, one to the\r\neast, and another to the west. To these five or six days ten or twenty\r\nmay be added. This is ordinary calculation of Desert time.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, Jabour called with a young man, who had a bullet lodged in his\r\narm, which he had received in a skirmish with the Shânbah. I could only\r\nrecommend a surgical operation, and his going to Tripoli. At this Jabour\r\nwas alarmed, and asked \"What would the Turks do to the young man?\"\r\nbegging of me medicine. I offered to take him under my protection, but it\r\nwas of no avail. The amiable Sheikh was as friendly as ever. I asked him\r\nto write a letter to England. Jabour replied justly, \"You are my letter;\r\nI have written on you. You can tell your Sultan and people the news of us\r\nall.\" \"Don't be afraid to return, there are no banditti in that route.\r\nThe Shânbah are in the west,\" he added. I promised, if ever returning to\r\nGhat, I would bring him a sword with his name engraven upon it. He said,\r\n\"I know you will, Yâkob.\" I am tempted to think Jabour is the only\r\ngentleman amongst the Touaricks. Another of Hateetah's cousins came to\r\nbeg, but went away empty-handed. This evening visited Bel-Kasem in the\r\nexpectation of seeing Khanouhen. The prince saluted me very friendly, and\r\nasked, in a sarcastic tone, \"How is the English Consul (Hateetah)?\" My\r\nappearance then suggested thoughts about Christians. \"What is the name of\r\nthe terrible warrior who has killed so many Christians in Algeira?\" he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Abd-el-Kader.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yâkob,\" he continued, \"come, let you and me fight, for it seems\r\nMussulmans and Christians must fight. Here, I'll lend you a spear,--take\r\nthat\" (giving me a huge iron lance.) I took it, and turning to\r\nBel-Kasem, said, \"What's this cost?\" so evading the challenge. \"The price\r\nof a camel,\" shouted Bel-Kasem at the top of his voice. \"Ah!\" cried\r\nKhanouhen, \"right, now sit down again; men are fools to fight--why cut\r\none another's throats?\" \"Yâkob,\" he went on, \"your Sultan's a woman, does\r\nshe fight?\" There was now a tremendous knocking at the door. This was two\r\nor three cousins of Hateetah. \"D----n that Hateetah,\" cried Khanouhen,\r\n\"Bel-Kasem, turn them away.\" Hereupon, Bel-Kasem started up in the most\r\nabject style of obedience, and pushed one of his slaves out of the\r\nroom-door into the open court, crying \"Bago, bago\" (not at home). There\r\nare certain foreign words which get currency, and supplant all native\r\nones. This \"bago\" is neither Touarghee, nor Ghadamsee, nor Arabic,\r\nalthough used by persons speaking almost exclusively these languages.\r\nBago is Housa, as before mentioned. Then the slave called \"Bago, bago,\r\nbago;\" then half-a-dozen slaves, close to the street-door, called \"Bago,\r\nbago, bago.\" The knocking continued; the \"bagos\" continued, the uproar\r\nwas hideous. Then Bel-Kasem gave his slave a slap, crying, \"Bago, you\r\n_kelb_ (dog).\" Now the slave was off again to the other slaves, shouting\r\nand yelling \"Bagos,\" till the \"bagos\" drowned the knocking and the\r\nclamour without, and the disappointed supper-hunters retired growling\r\nlike hungry wolves of the evening. Bel-Kasem now gave me a hint to fetch\r\nthe money for Khanouhen. I was off and back in an instant, very glad to\r\ngive the Sheikh the money according to our new compact. I put it into the\r\nhands of Bel-Kasem. \"Go out,\" said Bel-Kasem, \"and see the fine parrots I\r\nhave bought.\" I went out, and in the meanwhile the politic merchant\r\nslipped the money into the hands of the Prince. When I came back, they\r\nboth began to ridicule Hateetah. The Prince said, \"Yâkob, place yourself\r\nunder the sword of Hateetah, and go out with him and fight a hundred\r\nShânbah.\" \"Oh, he's an ass,\" replied Bel-Kasem. Such was their style of\r\nridicule. Bel-Kasem is a well-meaning little fellow, but a sort of fool\r\nor jester of the Sheikh's. Khanouhen allows him to say anything and do\r\nanything, but laughs at him all the time. Bel-Kasem always brings the\r\nSheikh some pretty present, and Khanouhen throws around him his powerful\r\narm of protection. The slavish merchant and faithful sycophant always\r\ncalls him Sultan, swears by the Sheikh's beard in his quarrels with the\r\nother merchants, and threatens all his rivals in trade with Khanouhen's\r\nwrath.\r\n\r\nThe Sahara has its factions in every group of its society. It would\r\nappear that without faction neither Saharan nor any other sort of society\r\ncould exist. Ghadames gives us its _Ben Weleed_ and _Ben Wezeet_. Ghat\r\ngives us three great factions in its Republic of Sheikhs. We may thus\r\nclassify their politics:--\r\n\r\nMONARCHICAL FACTION.\r\n\r\nMohammed Shafou Ben Seed, _the Sultan_ of the Ghat, or Azgher Touaricks.\r\nEl-Haj Mohammed Khanouhen Ben Othman, the heir-apparent of the throne.\r\nMarabout El-Haj Ahmed Ben El-Haj, Es-Sadeek, Governor of the town of Ghat.\r\nOuweek (second-rate Sheikh).\r\n\r\nARISTOCRATIC FACTION.\r\n\r\nMohammed Ben Jabour, Marabout Sheikh.\r\n\r\nDEMOCRATIC FACTION.\r\n\r\nBerka Ben Entăshāf, the most aged of the Sheikhs.\r\nThe Sheikh of gigantic stature[80].\r\nHateetah Ben Khouden, the \"_friend_\" of the English.\r\n\r\nI found the strongest demonstrations of rivalry, and the bitterest\r\nfeelings of faction, in the conduct of these several princes of The\r\nDesert, who are the personages of influence and authority amongst the\r\nGhat Touaricks. In the monarchical class the Governor of the town is\r\nallied to the Sultan by marriage, though Khanouhen has no family by the\r\nGovernor's sister. Shafou, the venerable Sultan, is of such gentle\r\nunassuming manners that he exercises no political influence over the wild\r\nsons of The Desert. Khanouhen embodies the Sultan, and is the man of\r\neloquence, of action, and intrepidity in the national councils. He is\r\nfeared by all (Jabour, perhaps, excepted), but, nevertheless, is not\r\ntyrannical in his administration of affairs. Jabour, the Marabout, is a\r\nwise, upright, and amiable prince. His influence extends beyond the Ghat\r\nTouaricks. Jabour told me himself, he had several people subject to his\r\nauthority, extending as far as Timbuctoo. To these, the Prince promised\r\nto commit me in case I determined to make a journey to Timbuctoo. Like\r\nKhanouhen, Jabour has two wives; one resides in Ghat, where the Sheikh\r\nhas a _town-house_, and the other in the country districts. He has,\r\nbesides, four or five sons. I saw one of them, who was as much of an\r\naristocrat as his father. The merchants assured me that Jabour's\r\ninfluence, more especially as he is a marabout, although he is no\r\ndemagogue priest of the _Higgins' calibre_, is unbounded. \"With a slave\r\nof Jabour,\" they declared, \"you may go to Timbuctoo, and all parts of\r\nSahara.\" The Sheikh himself does not visit the neighbouring countries.\r\nThis is not the custom of the Touaricks, the people being opposed to the\r\nSheikhs leaving their districts; but they send their slaves or relations\r\ncontinually about. Berka, the head of the democratic faction, is too old\r\nto exercise power, he has only strength enough to get about. The aged\r\nPrince paid me two visits, and was as gentle as gentleness could be. His\r\nfamily contains some powerful and intrepid chiefs, amongst the rest the\r\nGiant, the Goliath of the Ghat Touaricks. But, speaking of giants,\r\n_Bassa_, Sultan of the _Haghar_ Touaricks, is the real Giant of The\r\nDesert. Some of the people report this Giant Desert Prince to have six\r\nfingers on each hand, and to be several heads taller than he of Ghat. His\r\nspear, they describe, in the true spirit of the marvellous, to be,\r\n\"higher than the tallest palm.\" I may help their imagination, \"And the\r\nstaff of his spear is like a weaver's beam, and his spear's head weighs\r\nsix hundred shekels of iron,\" or is like--\r\n\r\n          \"The mast\r\n    Of some great admiral.\"\r\n\r\nWere I to adopt our present fanciful theories of accounting for the\r\norigin and migration of nations, I should here have a fine field before\r\nme, and the Touarghee giants of The Sahara would become, by the\r\ntransmuting fancy of our antiquarian theologians, the veritable\r\nPhilistines of Gath and Ekron. For many of the Berber tribes, amongst\r\nwhom the Touaricks are classed, especially the _Shelouh_ of Morocco,\r\nrelate traditionally that their fathers came from the land of the\r\nPhilistines, and that they themselves are Philistines. What then is\r\neasier than to find in the name of _Ghat_ the _Gath_ of the Philistines?\r\nBut unfortunately, _Azgher_ is the Touarick name of themselves and their\r\ncountry. Still the name of _Ghat_ must have its origin. As before\r\nnoticed, the original signification of the term _Ghat_ has been traced to\r\nmean \"_Sun_\" or \"God,\" in the ancient Libyo-Egyptian language. I am not\r\ncompetent to give an opinion on the subject. One of the Latin writers\r\nmakes the aboriginal people of North Africa to have been Medes. The\r\nprobability is they were Syrians of some class. From the coast they would\r\nnaturally pass or migrate to The Sahara.\r\n\r\nHateetah is an extremely pacific man in his conduct, and greatly liked\r\nfor his peace-making disposition; but he is only a second-rate Sheikh,\r\nand has no political influence over Touarick affairs, beyond what the\r\nchief of his family enjoys. He has several brothers and cousins, all\r\nesteemed Sheikhs, but with little or no power.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Touaricks is an assemblage of Chieftains, the\r\npeople supporting their respective leaders, the heads of their clans in\r\nthe feudal style, and all these controlled by a Sultan or Sheikh-Kebir.\r\nThe number of Sheikhs, when the lesser, or second and third-rate, Sheikhs\r\nare included, is very considerable, and makes the country, as the\r\nGovernor says, \"a country of Sheikhs.\" In their various districts, each\r\ngreater Sheikh exercises a sovereign, if not independent authority. In\r\nany national emergency, they all willingly unite for the common defence\r\nand protection, as now, when they are collecting their forces, in a\r\ncommon effort to extirpate the Shanbâh banditti. The people, however,\r\nenjoy complete liberty. The Touaricks, though a nation of chiefs and\r\nprinces, are in every sense and view a nation of freemen, and have none\r\nof those odious and effeminate vices which so darkly stain the Mahometans\r\nof the North Coast, or the Negro countries of Negroland. Every man is a\r\ntower of strength for himself, and his desert hut or tent, situate in\r\nvast solitudes, is his own inviolable home of freedom!\r\n\r\nAccording to Haj Ahmed, the Touaricks of Ghat muster fifteen thousand\r\nwarriors. Let them be ten thousand, this would give an entire population,\r\nincluding women, old men, and children, and slaves of both sexes, of\r\nabout sixty thousand souls. These Touaricks possess a good number of\r\nslaves, but of the male sex to look after their camels. Every able-bodied\r\nTouarick is a warrior, and is equipped with a dagger, suspended under the\r\nleft arm by a broad leather ring attached to the scabbard, and going\r\nround the wrist, and a Touarick of adult age is never seen without this\r\ndangerous weapon; a straight broad-sword is slung on his back, and he\r\ncarries a spear or lance in his right hand. Most of the spears have\r\nwooden shafts, but others are all metal, and mostly iron. Some are of\r\nfine and elegant workmanship, inlaid with brass, and of the value of a\r\ngood maharee, or thirty dollars. They have staves also, which they use\r\nas walking-sticks, or weapons of war, as it may be[81]. These are their\r\nweapons of warfare. The matchlock they despise. \"What can the enemy do\r\nwith the gun against the sword?\" the Targhee warriors ask contemptuously.\r\nThey, indeed, use the sword, their grand weapon, as the English soldier\r\nthe bayonet. Their superior tactic is to surprise the enemy, especially\r\nin the night, when the Genii help them, and hack him to pieces. The spear\r\nis used mostly to wound and disable the camel. Their manner of disposing\r\nof the booty, is characteristic. \"What are we to do with these women and\r\nchildren?\" they asked me, \"when we have exterminated the Shânbah men.\"\r\nWithout waiting for a reply they said:--\"Oh, we'll send them to the Turks\r\nand sell them.\" They have the example of the Turks themselves, who, on\r\nthe destruction of the Arab men in the mountains, collected the women and\r\nchildren together, and sent the best of them to Constantinople to be\r\nsold, in defiance of the express law of the Koran.\r\n\r\nThe maharee cannot be overlooked; this remarkable camel, which is\r\nlike the greyhound amongst dogs for swiftness and agility, and even\r\nshape, they train for war and riding like the horse. They do not\r\nrear the ordinary variety of camel found in North Africa and on the Coast.\r\n‮مَه٘رِي‬ or ‮مَه٘رِ‬, are the two manners in which I\r\nhave seen the Moorish talebs write this word in Arabic. An Arab\r\nphilologist says, the term Maharee is derived from the name of the\r\nArabian province of Mahra, on the south-east coast, adjoining Oman,\r\nwhence this fine species of camel is supposed originally to have\r\nbeen brought into The Desert. The Touaricks, of course, have very\r\ncurious legends about their peculiar camel. We have, however, the\r\nArabic ‮مهر‬, \"to be diligent,\" \"acute-minded,\" and the term\r\n‮مهاراة‬, \"flying away,\" from which ‮مهري‬ may probably\r\nbe derived. At least there is no apparent objection to such derivation. The\r\nHebrew cognate dialect has the word also. ‮מהר‬ signifies \"to\r\nhasten,\" \"to be quick;\" but I cannot assert positively it has any\r\nrelation with this derivation. In the books written on Western\r\nBarbary, we find the terms _heirée_ and _erragnol_ to denote the\r\n\"fleet\" or \"swift-footed camel,\" the former of which is apparently a\r\ncorruption of mahry or maharee. It is said that camels are called by names\r\nderived from the Arabic numerals, as _tesaee_, \"ten,\" (‮تسعي‬),\r\nand _sebaee_, \"seven,\" (‮سبعي‬) according as they perform\r\na journey of _ten_ days, or _seven_ days, in _one_; but I never\r\nheard of this distinction in any part of The Desert. It is pretended\r\nthat the mahry cannot live on the Coast of Africa on account of the\r\ncold. This has not been sufficiently tried, for Haj Ibrahim kept one\r\nat Tripoli, which thrived very well, and was in good condition. It\r\nis, however, a very chilly animal, and seems to feel the cold as\r\nmuch as the Touarghee himself. In its healthy state it is full of\r\nfire and energy, and always assumes the mastery over the camels of\r\nthe Coast, biting them, and trying to prevent them from eating with\r\nit in circle like other camels. Mounted on his mahry, dressed out\r\nfantastically in various and many-coloured harness, (the small\r\nsaddle being fixed on the withers, and the rider's legs on the neck\r\nof the animal,) with his sword slung on his back, dagger under the\r\nleft arm, and lance in the right hand, the Touarghee warrior sallies\r\nforth to war, daring everything, and fearing nothing but God and the\r\nDemons. In the year '44 they made an inroad upon the sandy wastes of\r\nthe Shânbah bandits; days and months they pursued the brigand tribe\r\nover the trackless regions of sand; and during this expedition they\r\nneither tasted food, nor drank a drop of water, for seven\r\ndays!--still keeping up a running fight, pursuing and butchering the\r\nShânbah, who all disappeared at last, concealed under heaps\r\nof sand. This statement, which shows the extraordinary power of\r\nendurance--the moral and physical temperance in the Touaricks, I had\r\nfrom the Governor of Ghat himself, and which coming from him\r\ndeserves credit. But the Touaricks do not eat every day though they\r\nmay have food in the house. They eat generally every other day. And\r\nthis amply suffices them when merely reclining in their tents, or\r\nlounging in the Souk. Habit is everything; we might all live on one\r\nmeal a day if we could accustom ourselves to it. The people pretend\r\nthat, though the Shânbah can count the grains of their desert region\r\nof sand, and know every form of the sand-mountains as well by night\r\nas by day, the Touaricks had nevertheless the advantage over them,\r\npursuing them better by night than by day, because the Genii were\r\ntheir guides; and many Shânbah, who had hid themselves under the\r\nsand, were unburied by the Genii, and slain by the Touaricks.\r\n\r\nI have given a case of Touarghee justice. During the Ghat Souk, all the\r\nSheikhs assemble in the great square, the Shelly, for the arrangement of\r\ndisputes; but it is mere form, and is more for gossiping and quizzing one\r\nanother, the Touarick being fond of a good joke. The principal Sheikh\r\npresent mounts a stone-bench, and sits down in a reclining posture,\r\nstriking his spear into the ground, which stands erect before him, as if\r\nawaiting his orders. The very first thing a Touarghee does when he stops\r\nand sits down, is to strike his spear into the ground or sand. When my\r\n_friend_ Ouweek was napping near me at the well of Tadoghseen, his spear\r\nwas struck into the sand close by his head. So it is said, \"And, behold,\r\nSaul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground at\r\nhis bolster.\" (1 Samuel, chap. xxvi. ver 7.) The Sheikh of highest rank\r\nnow seated, the Sheikhs next in dignity take their seats around him, at a\r\nshort distance off, in the form of a semicircle, these generally\r\nsquatting on the ground. Sometimes the principal Sheikh himself squats on\r\nthe ground. The cases of dispute are then brought forward, if any. The\r\ninfliction of punishment is by fines. There is nothing in the shape of a\r\nprison,--this delectable institution being the work and discovery of\r\ncivilization. Our Irishman might indeed, without a bull, with his back to\r\nThe Desert, and his face to the civilized communities of the Coast,\r\nexclaim, on sight of the first prison and gibbet, \"Thank God, I am out of\r\nthe land of Barbarians, and have reached the land of Civilization!\" Of\r\nfines, I heard of no other case than that of the Sultan fining two\r\nstrangers a couple of dollars, whilst resident in Ghat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Shelly there are ranges of benches of two and three\r\nflights. It is an imposing sight, to pass through the square late in the\r\nafternoon, just before they leave, and see all the Touaricks mounted on\r\nthese benches. Row upon row, range upon range, they sit, closely jammed\r\ntogether, as thick as Milton's spirits in Pandemonium, and not unlike\r\nthem, with their dark and concealed countenances, so mysteriously muffled\r\nup with the dread litham, having before them ranges of spears, parallel\r\nto themselves, a bright forest hedge of pines, awaiting their orders for\r\nwar or warlike pomp. I have frequently passed this forest range of\r\nlances, and looked up fearfully to the dark enigmatical figures or shapes\r\nof human beings, reclining in the most profound death-like silence, not\r\nexchanging a word with one another. A most trivial call of attention, a\r\nrustling or breath of an accident of novelty, nevertheless, is enough to\r\nput instant action and fire into these ranged masses of ice-congealed or\r\nstone statue-like warriors, who will then rush down upon the attractive\r\nobject headlong, one falling over the other, until their childish\r\ncuriosity being satisfied, the wild tumult subsides, and they themselves\r\nsink into their wonted blank inanity. But it is a fact, they will sit\r\nmotionless thus for hours and hours, and not condescend to speak to their\r\nbest friend amongst the merchants. This is their idea of dignity and\r\nsuperior rank over their fellows. It would appear, from the account of\r\nthe Sultan of Bornou, that he, also, never condescends to speak when he\r\nreceives a foreign envoy. \"Slowness of motion,\" in Barbary, and I imagine\r\nin The East, is also considered a mark of dignity. A full-blown\r\nfashionable Moor always walks extremely slow. The Touarick usually rises\r\nup slowly, and deliberately walks out of the house in the same way, but\r\notherwise he continues a fair pace. What is curious, a Touarick never\r\nspeaks and salutes when he leaves you; his compliments and inquiries of\r\nhealth, are all on his entrance into your house.\r\n\r\nIt now seems pretty well agreed upon by all parties who converse about my\r\naffairs, that I should return and make greater preparations, and bring\r\nwith me two or three others, fellow-travellers, so as to render an\r\nexpedition of this sort more useful and respectable. But the disadvantage\r\nalways is, if it get abroad that such a mission is coming, laden with\r\npresents, money and provisions, the danger is tenfold augmented, whilst\r\nan indigent person like myself is in comparative security. A single\r\nperson has also his own advantages over a mission of two or three, or\r\nmore. He is his own master he is responsible alone for himself. Who\r\nknows, but what something disastrous had happened if I had had with me\r\nsome hot-headed companion? A man will lose his life any time in The\r\nDesert in five minutes if he cannot keep his temper. He may occasionally\r\nassume airs of being angry for policy's sake, and check the insolence of\r\nsome low fellow, and with other advantages. But the point is, to be cool\r\nin danger and embarrassments, which, if a man cannot be, let him go into\r\nThe Great Desert at his peril. It was for the same reason I would not\r\nbring with me an European servant from Tripoli, whose fluency in Arabic\r\nmight have been attended with the greatest danger to us both instead of\r\nassistance. Said is pestered with questions about me or my affairs; but\r\nat times Said is stupid enough, and people get tired of asking him\r\nquestions. I must mention, however, one thing to his credit and to his\r\ncunning sagacity; although a thousand times questioned, whether he\r\nhimself were a slave, and how he came with me, he never let out that he\r\nwas a runaway slave from Tunis, not even to his dearest companions of\r\ntravel. Generally when asked a question of our affairs, he says,\r\n_Ma-Nârafsh_, \"I don't know,\" and this he does as much from his indolence\r\nin not wishing to talk as from policy. Here I shall take the liberty of\r\nstating the several objections to my proceeding this year to Soudan:--\r\n\r\n1st. My health is beginning to sink under pressure of the climate, as\r\nwell as under various vexations and annoyances. Amongst the latter, I\r\nhave received nothing which I wrote for to Tripoli, to persons whom I\r\nconsidered friends of the mission, one thing excepted, and certainly not\r\nthe least thing, the money. (And I embrace the opportunity of thanking\r\ngratefully Signor Francovich, Austrian merchant of Tripoli, for letting\r\nme have money whenever I asked him, promptly and immediately, and to any\r\namount which I drew for).\r\n\r\n2nd. Amongst the things written for to Tripoli, and which did not arrive,\r\nwere medicine, and some common instruments of observation. The medicine\r\nwas packed up by Dr. Dickson, but neglected to be sent until the caravan\r\nhad left Ghadames. The instruments, which could easily have been procured\r\nin Tripoli, were of the greatest consequence, in making a more extended\r\ntour intelligible.\r\n\r\n3rd. Kanou, being reported by all the merchants as \"a country of fever,\"\r\nit would have been exceedingly imprudent for me to have gone further\r\nwithout a good stock of medicines. We have no right to plunge ourselves\r\ninto the flood of the Niger, and then accuse the hand of Providence for\r\nnot saving us from a watery grave. One might have escaped the fever, as\r\none might have been picked up by the swimming of a black man; but such a\r\n\"might\" belongs to accident, not the planning and arranging of legitimate\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with ten or more reasons, all having more\r\nor less of weight, which I have recorded in my journal, but which are\r\nmore curious than sensible. I mention, that, on my departure from Ghat, I\r\nwrote to the Sultan of Aheer, by the advice of my best friends, informing\r\nhim of my intention to visit him at some future period. It is a mistake\r\nthat, the taking of these Saharan princes unawares; they consider it\r\ninfinitely more friendly to be written to beforehand. A stranger, and\r\nespecially a Christian, coming down upon them unexpectedly, excites\r\nsuspicion which may never be afterwards removed. The Touarick Princes of\r\nAheer are considered the only difficulty, so far as governments are\r\nconcerned, in the rest of the route. The Fullan Princes of Soudan are\r\nrepresented as eminently friendly to every body, every stranger of\r\nwhatever clime or religion. However, I do not pretend to know what effect\r\nthe Niger expedition may have produced on the Fullans, with respect to\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_7th._--Stayed at home all the day. The _fœx populi_ is a great\r\nworry to me. They have no encouragement from the Sheikhs, but are\r\nnot less the cause of my shutting myself up at home. Evening, when\r\nthe streets were clear, visited Haj Ibrahim. He has purchased the\r\nfeathers of a splendid Soudan ostrich for five dollars, which in\r\nTripoli he will sell for ten. The bird is skinned and the feathers\r\nremain unplucked. The _quæstio vexata_, as to who is Haj Ibrahim's\r\n\"friend,\" _sahab_ (‮صاحب‬), to whom he should pay his\r\ntribute-present, for visiting the Souk, is at length decided in\r\nfavour of Berka. The old gentleman produced witnesses that all\r\nJerbini belonged to him, or are under his protection, and as Haj\r\nIbrahim is a native of Jerbah, he claimed the rich merchant. The\r\nseveral Sheikhs have the several merchants under their protection.\r\nShafou has those of Tunis, Jabour those of Tripoli, under their\r\nrespective protection, and so of the rest. The merchants pay for\r\ntheir protection from ten to twenty dollars, according to their\r\nmeans. Frequently a group of traders do not pay more than a single\r\nindividual; some get off with paying only a dollar. These demands on\r\nthe merchants are certainly very moderate, and the Touaricks\r\nscarcely deserve the epithets of _exigeant_ and extortionate which\r\nare so freely applied to them by the merchants. Haj Ibrahim, who\r\nbrings some thousand dollars' worth of goods to this part, pays only\r\nthe paltry sum of some twenty or thirty dollars at the most. In\r\nfact, here is free-trade with a vengeance, existing long before it\r\nhas been attempted to carry it out, with such tremendous\r\nconsequences, as in Great Britain. France and the Zollverein must\r\nsend agents to the Souk of Ghat, say half a dozen University\r\nstudents each, to study free-trade principles from the barbarians of\r\nThe Desert. Indeed Touaricks carry out their system beautifully and\r\nlike gentlemen, and the Aheer merchants pay nothing in Ghat, and the\r\nGhat merchants pay nothing in Aheer, for the privileges of commerce,\r\nin the way of customs' dues. The merchants and Arabs of Derge pay\r\nnothing whatever, a privilege of ancient date granted to this class\r\nof Tripoline merchants. But the Souk flourishes with its free-trade\r\nmart, and excites the jealousies of the merchants of Mourzuk, and\r\ntheir masters the Turks, because some of the merchants pass from\r\nhere direct to Algeria and Tunis, not touching the Tripoline\r\nterritory, and in this way the Turks lose their much-coveted\r\n_gomerick_, or customs' duty. I am happy to record the present\r\ninstance of these extortioners being overreached, or rather,\r\nvanquished by an honourable system of trade. Certainly, were it not\r\nfor the high duties levied on merchandize at Mourzuk and Ghadames,\r\nmany of the merchants of this Souk would visit those cities, and the\r\nTurks could not fail to benefit by this extra rendezvous of\r\nmerchants. Haj Ibrahim does not think the whole of what all the\r\nSheikhs together collect as presents, at the annual Ghat Souk, to be\r\nmore than 250 or 300 dollars. In case Great Britain should think it\r\nworth while to bribe or buy the services of the Touaricks of The\r\nDesert, to intercept the slave-caravans, and so discourage the\r\ntraffic, it certainly could be done for some 500 dollars per annum,\r\nor for very little more, if it were a question of money only.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[79] The merchants call these loaves of French beet-root sugar,\r\n    _Ras_, _i. e._, \"head.\"\r\n\r\n[80] Having always called him the _Giant_ in my notes, I neglected\r\n    to get his name.\r\n\r\n[81] The spear is called _âlagh_, ‮علق‬, the dagger _tayloukh_,\r\n    ‮تيلوخ‬, the sword _takoubah_, ‮تيكوبة‬, and the\r\n    stave, with a spear point, âzallah, ‮عزلّة‬. The old men,\r\n    like indeed Shafou, frequently make use of a large stick, instead\r\n    of a spear, when they walk about. Usually the Touaricks carry their\r\n    lances with them, and all their arms, even in paying the most\r\n    friendly visits. To strangers they look infinitely more formidable\r\n    than they are, or they themselves pretend to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED RESIDENCE IN GHAT.\r\n\r\n     Commerce of Winter Mart at Ghat.--Visit to Hateetah, and meet the\r\n     Sultan.--Means of suppressing Saharan Slave Trade by the\r\n     Touaricks.--Hateetah refuses my returning with a Bengazi\r\n     Caravan.--Bad Character of Arabs.--Receive a Visit from His\r\n     Highness the Sultan; and interesting Conversation with him.--Ghat\r\n     Townsmen great Bigots.--Unexpected Meeting with the Sultan.--My\r\n     Targhee Friend's opinion of War.--Mode of Baking Bread.--Country\r\n     of Touat.--The British Consul is perplexed at his _Master_ being\r\n     a Lady.--Vulgar error of Christians ill-treating Mussulmans in\r\n     Europe.--People teach the Slaves to call me Infidel.--Visit to\r\n     Bel Kasem, and find Khanouhen.--The free-thinking of this\r\n     Prince.--Said's apprehensions of Touaricks.--Hateetah's opinion\r\n     of stopping Saharan Slave-Dealing.--Shafou leaves\r\n     Ghat.--Discussion of Politics with an assemblage of\r\n     Chiefs.--Description of the Touarick Tribes and Nations of The\r\n     Great Desert.--Description of Aheer and Aghadez.--Leo's Account\r\n     of the Targhee Desert.--Daughters of the Governor\r\n     Educated.--Touaricks refuse aid from the Turks against the\r\n     Shânbah.--A private Slave-Mart.--Ghat comparatively free from\r\n     Crime.--Visit from Berka.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is not my intention to enter into the statistics of trade, but I\r\nmention a few facts. Caravans from Soudan, including all the large\r\ncities, but especially from Kanou, from Bornou, from the Tibboo country,\r\nfrom Touat, from Fezzan, from Souf, from Ghadames, and from Tripoli,\r\nTunis, and the North coast, visited the Ghat Souk of this winter. The\r\nnumber of merchants, traders, and camel-drivers was about 500, the slaves\r\nimported from Soudan to Bornou about 1000, and the camels employed in the\r\ncaravans about 1050. Provision caravans from Fezzan also were constantly\r\ncoming to Ghat during the Souk. The main commerce of these caravans\r\nconsisted of the staple exports, of slaves, elephants' teeth, and senna,\r\nthe united value of which, at the market this year, was estimated at\r\nabout 60,000_l._, which value would be doubled, on arriving at the\r\nEuropean markets.\r\n\r\nNext to these grand objects of commerce were ostrich feathers, skins, and\r\nhides in considerable quantities. Then followed various articles of minor\r\ncharacter, but of Soudanic manufacture, which are brought to the Souk,\r\nviz., wooden spoons, bowls, and other utensils for cooking; also sandals,\r\nwooden combs, leather pillow-cases, bags, purses, pouches, bottles and\r\nskin-bags for water, &c.; arms, consisting of spears, lances, staves,\r\ndaggers, straight broad-swords, leather and dried skin shields. Some of\r\nthese weapons are made all of metal; the blades of the swords are\r\nmanufactured in Europe and America. These arms are mostly for the\r\nequipment of the Ghat and Touat Touaricks, and are nearly all\r\nmanufactured in Aheer. Provisions are also exported from Soudan and Aheer\r\nto this mart, consisting of semen or liquid butter; ghusub or drâ;\r\nghafouly[82], sometimes called Guinea corn; hard cheese from Aheer, which\r\nis pounded before eaten; beef, cut into shreds, and without salt, dried\r\nin the sun and wind; peppers of the most pungent character, an extremely\r\nsmall quantity sufficing to season a large dish; a species of shell\r\nfruit, called by the Moors Soudan almonds[83]; bakhour, or frankincense;\r\nand ghour nuts and koudah, which are masticated as tobacco. There is\r\nthen, finally, the great cotton manufacture, which clothes half the\r\npeople of The Desert. Whole caravans of these cottons arrive together,\r\nand they are even conveyed from Ghat to Timbuctoo, this extremely\r\nroundabout way from Soudan. The colour is mostly a blue-black, sometimes\r\na lighter blue, and glazed and shining. But the indigo is ill-prepared,\r\nand the dyeing as badly done, and the consequence is, the cottons are\r\nvery begriming in the wearing. The indigo plant is simply cut, and thrown\r\ninto a pond of water to ferment with the articles to be dyed, and after a\r\nshort time the cottons are taken out, dried, pressed, and glazed with\r\ngum. It is these dark cottons which the Touaricks are so passionately\r\nfond of. The only live animals brought over The Desert from Soudan and\r\nAheer are sheep and parrots.\r\n\r\nThe articles of import to the Souk from Europe are sufficiently well\r\nknown; they are chiefly silks and cloth, but of the most ordinary sort,\r\nand, of showy colours, red, yellow, light green. Raw silk and brocades;\r\nbeads, glass and composition; small, looking-glasses; wooden bracelets,\r\nfantastically painted; sword-blades; needles[84]; paper[85]; razors; some\r\nspices, cloves, &c.; attar of roses; carpet-rugs; \"Indians,\" or coarse\r\nwhite cottons; bornouses and barracans, &c., &c. But it may be observed,\r\nall the European articles introduced into Central Africa are of the most\r\nordinary description possible. Barracans or blankets are brought from\r\nvarious places for sale at Ghat, but mostly from the Souf and Touat\r\noases, where the women weave them in great quantities. They are very warm\r\nand serviceable in the winter months, and are even carried to Soudan,\r\nwhere during the rainy and damp season these woollens are highly prized\r\nfor their usefulness, and found greatly conducive to health. No\r\nfire-arms, which I could observe, are brought for sale here. There is\r\nscarcely any gold trade; a very small quantity is brought here _viâ_\r\nTouat from Timbuctoo. The money in circulation at the Souk is nearly all\r\nSpanish. The exceptions are two small Turkish coins, called karoobs, one\r\nof the value of about an English penny, and the other double this. A few\r\nTunisian piastres pass amongst merchants of the north. It is not the\r\nlarge pillared-dollar (mudfah) which is in circulation, but the\r\nquarter-dollars of Spain. Five of these quarter-dollars make up the value\r\nof a whole Spanish dollar, and four are the value of the current or ideal\r\ndollar, called the small dollar. The Soudanese merchants, who are\r\naccustomed to see this money brought from the western coast, flatly\r\nrefuse all other monies but the Spanish. There is not a great quantity\r\nof it here; merchants keep up the supply of this currency by exporting it\r\nfrom Touat and Morocco. No gold coins are in circulation, nor any copper.\r\nThe Turkish money, excepting the karoobs mentioned, will not pass here;\r\npeople detest it as much as they do the Turks themselves. I once asked an\r\northodox merchant how it was, that Mussulmans preferred the money of\r\ninfidel Christians to that of the Sultan of the Faithful? He naïvely\r\nreplied, \"God has taught Christians to make money, because although used\r\nin this world, it is accursed. Mussulmans touch the abominable thing, but\r\ndon't pollute themselves by making it. In the next world Mussulmans will\r\nhave all good things and enjoyments without money; but Christians will\r\nhave molten money, like hot running lead, continually pouring down their\r\nthroats as their torment for ever.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a very ancient story in circulation (in books) respecting the\r\npeculiar manner of carrying on trade somewhere in the neighbourhood of\r\nTimbuctoo. It is copied by Shaw from former writers on Africa. \"At a\r\ncertain time of the year,\" the honest Doctor says, \"they (Western Moors)\r\nmake this journey in a numerous caravan, carrying along with them coral\r\nand glass beads, bracelets of horn, knives, scissors, and such like\r\ntrinkets. When they arrive at the places appointed, which is on such a\r\nday of the moon, they find in the evening several different heaps of gold\r\ndust lying at a small distance from each other, against which the Moors\r\nplace so many of their trinkets as they judge will be taken in exchange\r\nfor them. If the Nigritians, the next morning, approve of the bargain,\r\nthey take up the trinkets and leave the gold-dust, or else make some\r\ndeductions from the latter. In this manner they transact their exchange\r\nwithout seeing one another, or without the least instance of dishonesty\r\nor perfidiousness on their part.\" This curious instance of Nigritian\r\ncommerce has certainly been copied from the following passage in\r\nHerodotus, proving the high antiquity of the ingenious fable:--\"It is\r\ntheir (the Carthaginian's) custom,\" says the father of history, \"on\r\narriving among them (the people beyond the columns of Hercules) to unload\r\ntheir vessels, and dispose their goods along the shore; this done, they\r\nagain embark, and make a great smoke from on board. The natives seeing\r\nthis, come down immediately to the shore, and placing a quantity of gold,\r\nby way of exchange, retire. The Carthaginians then land a second time,\r\nand if they think the gold equivalent, they take it and depart--if not,\r\nthey again go on board their vessels. The inhabitants return, and add\r\nmore gold till the crews are satisfied. The whole is conducted with the\r\nstrictest integrity, for neither will one touch the gold till they have\r\nleft an adequate value in merchandize, nor will the other remove the\r\ngoods, till the Carthaginians have taken away the gold.\" This story,\r\nunhappily for the guileless simplicity of our merchants here, is too good\r\nto be true, like most artless stories of this sort. I made inquiries of\r\nmerchants who had lived nearly all their lifetimes in Timbuctoo, and not\r\nfar from the gold country, but they had never heard of this pretty\r\nprimitive mode of barter. And yet the story has a real African or Negro\r\nlook in it. One cannot positively assert that something like this might\r\nnot have existed amongst the Nigritians and their foreign exchangers of\r\nproduce and merchandize. Let us hope, for the honesty of mankind, that\r\nthe fable had a genuine origin.\r\n\r\n_8th._--Called on Hateetah this morning. Still the Sheikh bothers me\r\nabout presents for his brothers; he had also the conscience to ask for\r\nanother barracan for himself. I stood out, determined to give nothing to\r\nhim or his brothers and cousins. Spent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. His\r\nfriend, the Ghadamsee merchant, Ahmed Ben Kaka, who makes the journey\r\nfrom Tripoli to Noufee, says he saw the English steamers of the late\r\nNiger expedition, so he must have descended lower than Noufee. He says\r\nthey came up to _Yetferrej_, \"amuse themselves,\" and look about. He had\r\nnot heard of their anti-slavery objects. According to him, \"Fever and\r\nsickness prevail more at Kanou than Noufee.\"\r\n\r\n_9th._--A fine morning, but cold. Slept little; these fits of not\r\nsleeping come on repeatedly. The Touarghee who has charge of my camel has\r\nbrought her from the grazing districts. On arriving at Ghat, all the\r\nmerchants send their camels to graze in these places. The Touarghee asks\r\nfor barley or straw whilst the nagah is here. The incident reminds me\r\nof--\"Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they\r\nunto the place where the officers were, every man according to his\r\ncharge.\" (1st Book of Kings, chap. iii. 28.) This is the food of horses\r\nand camels to the present day in North Africa; the barley is principally\r\nfor the horses, and the straw, when it is chopped into little pieces, is\r\ngiven to both horses and camels. The Touaricks show the greatest\r\nantipathy to the Arabs, more especially since the late murderous attack\r\nof the Shânbah on their defenceless countrymen. Some of the Touaricks go\r\nso far as to say, \"Mahomet was not an Arab.\" My Touarghee friend Omer\r\nquarrelled violently with two Souf Arabs, who were also visiting me. I\r\ntold them it was indecent to quarrel in the house of a stranger whom they\r\nwere together visiting, and they made it up, shaking hands.\r\n\r\n_10th._--Visited a patient, but had some difficulty in persuading him to\r\ntake my nostrums. Afterwards called on Hateetah, and, to my agreeable\r\nsurprise, found there the Sultan. I did not at first recognize His\r\nHighness, the _litham_ being entirely removed from his face[86]. I was\r\nvexed at my awkwardness, but the good-natured Sheikhs, several of whom\r\nwere present, readily excused me. His Highness and another Sheikh were\r\neating a sort of _bazeen_ or pudding, with curd milk, out of a large\r\nwooden bowl. Each had a spoon with which they scooped up the pudding one\r\nafter another. I have sometimes seen two persons eating from a dish and\r\nhaving but one spoon, which they used alternately, one fellow watching\r\nanxiously the other with greediness, and measuring with a hungry eye the\r\nsize of his friend's spoonfuls. It is an advance on the Arabs, this use\r\nof spoons, and I always took care to praise the Touaricks for their use\r\nof spoons. In the open country, when a Touarghee has finished his meal he\r\ndrives the handle into the sand to keep the lower part dry. These spoons\r\nare all made in Soudan, and are extremely neat, the shaft of the spoon\r\nbeing very much bent, and the bottom very large and deepened in. His\r\nHighness now told me he should send a present to the Queen, and asked me\r\nif I would take a maharee. This I declined, on account of the expenses of\r\nbringing such an animal to England on my own responsibility. Hateetah\r\nsaid, \"Why how foolish, when you get to Mourzuk the Consul will give you\r\nplenty of money.\" I told him I did not know the Consul there, and must\r\nnot trust to any Consuls for such matters. None of the Sheikhs could\r\nunderstand this objection. On getting up to take leave of His Highness he\r\nasked: \"How do you like our country? What do you think of our merchants?\r\nAre the people civil to you? Shall you again return? How old are you? Why\r\ndo you travel so far? Will it not shorten your life? Will not your Sultan\r\ngive you a great deal of money for coming so far?\" &c. Hateetah now told\r\nme to sit down again. All were reclining on mats, and no particular\r\nattention was paid to the Sultan. A merchant present said, \"Why don't you\r\nbuy and sell, the Souk is open? We wish to see the English come here to\r\nbuy senna and elephants' teeth. But the English don't purchase slaves.\" I\r\nthen, half-doubting the propriety of, and greatly puzzled how to\r\nintroduce the subject, tried to make an effort. \"How much,\" asked I, \"do\r\nthe Touaricks get from the merchants who deal in slaves? I don't think\r\nmore than three hundred dollars a year?\" (Several of the Sheikhs nodded\r\nassent.) \"Well, now, if the Sultan and the Touaricks would stop the\r\ntraffic in slaves here, perhaps the English would give them three\r\nthousand dollars per annum.\" They all laughed at this, and the merchant\r\nof Ghat took upon himself to say, for the Sultan and the Sheikhs, \"Bring\r\nthe money.\" To this I rejoined, \"But see now, I can't interfere, I'm not\r\nthe English Consul; Hateetah (turning to him) is the English Consul, let\r\nhim write for Shafou, to our Queen and arrange everything. I'll take\r\nShafou's present and bring back his from our Sultan. This is all I can\r\ndo.\" Hateetah raised himself up at this sally, and looked very\r\nconsequentially upon all around, even upon Shafou, as much as to say,\r\n\"Don't you hear, The Christian makes me the English Consul, and am I not\r\nthe English Consul?\" Was glad to escape from the subject in this way,\r\ndetermined not to pursue it further, knowing the bitter hatred it would\r\ncreate in the minds of the merchants against me, if the conversation got\r\nabroad. Still felt happy in having broached the subject, and attacked\r\ntheir selfish feelings on the point. Government might spend a few pounds\r\nout of the million per annum, (the cost of the suppression on the Western\r\nCoast,) in buying the co-operative influence of these Sheikhs, who hold\r\nthe _keys_ of The Desert. There is no moral reason for leaving one part\r\nof Africa a prey to this scourge, and concentrating all our efforts in\r\nanother region of this unhappy continent. I left the Sultan and Hateetah\r\nin a good humour, after promising them some tobacco. Hateetah showed me\r\nthe leather pillow-case which Shafou intended to send Her Majesty.\r\nHateetah this morning seemed to have got the Sultan's ear, but as soon as\r\nthe old gentleman returns to Khanouhen, all the English Consul's\r\ninfluence will evaporate in smoke.\r\n\r\n_11th._--Called upon the Governor and met there Haj Abdullah of Bengazi.\r\nPersuaded him to wait till to-morrow and take me with him to Mourzuk.\r\nThen called on Hateetah, who would not consent to this. He says, \"I must\r\nnot go this way with a couple of people through The Desert. I must go\r\neither with him or his brother in the course of a few days, carrying the\r\npresents of Shafou and a letter for the Queen.\" Agreed to this, it being\r\na matter of indifference whether I stopped a few days longer or not,\r\nafter waiting so long and to such little purpose. Was annoyed at my\r\nSoudan journey being cut off in the middle, and sometimes thought I would\r\nstill risk it, or \"go the whole hog.\" Perseverance overcomes obstacles\r\ndeemed by men impossibilities. Hateetah evidently feels his importance,\r\nand besides thinks he shall get a little more by my delay. He is right,\r\nfor Her Majesty's subjects don't ask for his protection every day. The\r\nGovernor pretends the Shânbah muster 10,000! This ignorance must be\r\nvoluntary, or the assertion is made to render the approaching victory of\r\nthe Touaricks more terrible to my conception. An Arab of Tripoli came\r\nhere a few days ago and personified himself as Abdullah, who was going to\r\nBengazi, asking me for an advance of money. Met him this morning and\r\naccused him of his impudent imposture, threatening to get him bastinadoed\r\nby the Pasha. The Arabs are without question the worst class of people\r\nwho visit this mart of commerce. What they don't do as brigands they\r\nattempt by fraud. Shaw tells us that, in his time, they lay in ambush in\r\nthe morning to attack the strangers whom they had hospitably entertained\r\nthe previous evening. Some of them still most richly deserve this\r\ncharacter. The Touaricks are so alarmed at the cold that there is no\r\nprospect of their marching out against the Shânbah for weeks yet. Several\r\nTouarghee camel-drivers will wait for the summer caravan before they\r\nundertake the journey to Aheer, on which route the cold is often severe\r\nat this season.\r\n\r\n_12th._--Occupied in reading Hebrew. Learnt a few Touarghee words.\r\nSeveral Touaricks called to beg dates; \"_Bago_,\" or \"Not at home.\" Did\r\nnot go out to-day.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Called upon Hateetah, who vexed me exceedingly again by begging.\r\nHer Majesty's Consul must have a regular salary, or Her Majesty's\r\nsubjects visiting here will have no peace of their lives. Told him to get\r\nup his camels and prepare for our departure, and then I would give him\r\nanother backsheesh.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, a messenger came from His Highness with the Sultan's dagger in\r\nhis hand, as guarantee that he came from His Highness. This is usual in\r\nGhat. Mr. Duncan has mentioned in his Travels through Dahomy, how he\r\noften received the King's stick as guarantee that the messenger came from\r\nHis Majesty. I inquired,\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nHe answered, \"Shafou wishes a dollar or a holee (barracan).\"\r\n\r\nNot understanding this, I said, \"To-morrow I will see.\"\r\n\r\n_The Messenger._--\"Should I bring Shafou here to your house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" I answered, very glad to have a visit from the Sultan.\r\n\r\n\"Now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, bring the Sultan at once,\" I continued.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes, before I could guess or imagine what was this strange\r\nbusiness, I heard His Highness knocking at the door, who, with the\r\nmessenger, immediately ascended the terrace. The old gentleman, on\r\nentering my room, refused my most pressing invitation to sit down on the\r\nottoman, preferring from sheer modesty to sit upon a skin stretched on\r\nthe floor. His Highness sat silent a few minutes, looking very\r\ngood-natured. As we were quite alone, I embraced the opportunity of\r\nspeaking very plainly to the Sultan. \"You see,\" I observed, \"our people\r\nare afraid to come here, not knowing whether the Touaricks will kill them\r\nor not. Have you not power to prevent the lesser Sheikhs from stopping\r\nChristians in The Desert, and threatening them with bad language.\" \"No,\"\r\nreplied the Sultan, \"I cannot be everywhere. Some of my children think\r\nthemselves better than their father. They will talk and have their own\r\nway[87]. But now, Yâkob, we have all agreed to protect you, why do you\r\nfear?\" \"I don't fear,\" I added, \"but cannot something be done for the\r\nprotection of Christians through The Desert.\" \"Here,\" said His Highness,\r\n\"is the question. You return home, you go to your Sovereign, for I have a\r\nsecret to tell you.\" \"What is that?\" I demanded anxiously. \"Up to now,\"\r\nsaid Shafou, mildly and deliberately, \"all the world has paid us tribute.\r\nThe merchants who come from the east or west, north or south, all pay us\r\ntribute. But the English do not pay us tribute. How's this? You must tell\r\nyour Sultana to pay us tribute, and speak to her yourself.\" I promised I\r\nwould if I had an opportunity, not attempting to dispute a moment such\r\npretensions. I simply recollected the Khan of Tartary, who, after dining\r\nhimself, went out and ordered his servant to proclaim to all the monarchs\r\nof earth his permission for them to dine, now that he had finished his\r\nown dinner. I told His Highness, I thought I should return next year; on\r\nwhich he said, \"Well do, I'll conduct you myself to Aheer.\" I then\r\nintroduced the delicate subject of slavery. I observed, \"The Sheikhs of\r\nthe Touaricks get very little from the merchants who deal in slaves. If\r\nYour Highness should put an end to this traffic, you would get more from\r\nus English.\" \"Yes, yes, that's what you said before,\" interposed the\r\nSultan. \"Try us, then, bring the money; at present, the English give us\r\nnothing.\" I mentioned to the Sultan that the Bey of Tunis had abolished\r\nthe traffic in slaves. \"Yes,\" said the messenger to the Sultan, \"it's\r\ntrue.\" The conversation now dropped, and I did not understand what was to\r\nbe done further. The messenger made a sign about the dollar. I had\r\nalready folded up mechanically a dollar in a piece of paper before the\r\nSultan came in, so I put this into the messenger's hand. I certainly\r\nshould have given the Sultan a dozen dollars if he had asked me, but the\r\nold gentleman's wishes and wants were few, and his modesty greater than\r\nthese. His Highness now got up, and shaking hands departed as pleased as\r\nPunch with his dollar. I question whether His Highness ever has any\r\nmoney; Khanouhen is treasurer and everything else. So I finished with the\r\ngood-natured gentle creature Shafou, having humbly presented The Sultan\r\nof all the Touaricks of Ghat with one dollar!\r\n\r\nJust after Shafou left, the messenger wished to play me a trick. He came\r\nrunning back, and said:--\"See this dagger, this belongs to Khanouhen; he\r\nsays you must give him half a dollar.\" I simply replied to the fellow, \"I\r\nknow nothing about it.\" I was convinced Khanouhen would never send such\r\na message. I laughed however at this fashion of sending about daggers. It\r\nhad something in it of the style of presenting a pistol to a man's breast\r\nwith the agreeable demand, \"Your money or your life.\"\r\n\r\nPassing through the gardens, I fell accidentally into conversation with a\r\ngardener. On mentioning, that if God spared my life, I should go to\r\nSoudan next year, he exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"What! do you know God?\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Yes, and all Christians know God.\"\r\n\r\n_The Gardener._--\"Why, then, are you an infidel?\"\r\n\r\nI repeated, \"All Christians pray and know God;\" and left him puzzled out\r\nof his wits. Ghat townsmen are beastly ignorant zealots, and confound\r\nChristians with the Pagan Negroes of Central Africa, whom also they call\r\n\"Ensara.\" Since Negroes worship the \"fetish,\" they think also we don't\r\nknow God. The Governor asked the other day, if the children of Christians\r\nlearnt to read and write like his children, the noisy hum of their\r\nreading coming into the room whilst we sat talking. I might have\r\nanswered, \"Some do,\" but used more general phraseology, \"Both boys and\r\ngirls with us learn to read and write.\" \"My girls learn also,\" replied\r\nthe Governor, with an air of triumph. I was glad to see female education\r\nencouraged in Ghat by the Marabout, as it is also in Ghadames.\r\n\r\nTouaricks are afraid, and distrust Arabs; and Arabs are afraid, and\r\ndistrust Touaricks; and both these are afraid of, and distrust Turks.\r\nThere is no mutual confidence in these various Mahometan people.\r\nNevertheless, except the Shânbah incursions, everything goes on pretty\r\nquietly, and I hear of no murders, or acts of violence, in this region of\r\nThe Sahara. There is certainly no Irish or Indian Thuggism amongst\r\nSaharan barbarians.\r\n\r\n_14th._--The weather during these three days has been fine, no wind (the\r\nhorror of our people), and very warm. Our departure is protracted from\r\nday to day. Time may be money in England, here it is as valueless as the\r\nsand of these deserts. Got up very early, as I sometimes do, and went to\r\nsee the Governor. I was alone. In the distance (it was scarcely\r\ndaylight), I saw a tall figure looming, embodying forth. I continued, and\r\nit neared me. This shadowy figure at length became visibly formed, and\r\nexpanded itself into the full stature of Shafou, who was like myself all\r\nalone. His Highness was as surprised to meet me as I was surprised to\r\nmeet him at this time of morning. Shafou stopped suddenly, and then\r\nputting his hand to his tobacco pouch, which he carried on his left arm,\r\nand without speaking, gave me to understand that I had not sent the\r\ntobacco which I had promised him. Indeed, I could not get it from Haj\r\nIbrahim. I addressed this silent admonition of my forgetfulness or\r\nshort-coming, by saying, \"Yes, I understand, I'll send the tobacco.\" His\r\nHighness then slowly passed on, just raising his hand to salute me at\r\nparting, but without uttering a word. Afterwards, called on Hateetah, who\r\nhad heard from the messenger about my wonderful liberality in giving a\r\ndollar to the Sultan, and was very angry. \"Who is Shafou?\" he\r\nperemptorily asked. \"He is nothing. You have given him a large present,\r\nand me very little. Now, if any body hurts you, I shall be silent.\" I\r\ntook no notice whatever of this ungracious speech. A son of the Governor\r\npaid me a visit on my return, and was very saucy, calling me a Kafer. I\r\ninstantly turned him out of the house. Then came in my young Touarghee\r\nfriend, which was a positive relief to me. I said:--\"Are you not afraid\r\nto go warring with the Shânbah?\" He answered me pathetically,\r\nprospectively submitting himself to the Divine Decrees:--\"If it be the\r\nwill of God that I go warring against the Shânbah, and fall and die\r\nthere, what then? for go it is inscribed in the Book of Heaven.\" As to\r\nthe justice of the war, like our young soldiers, it never occupied his\r\nthoughts. He merely goes to war because his master and prince goes to\r\nwar. What would the Peace Society say to him?\r\n\r\nPeople in Ghat have a very primitive way of making bread. They place a\r\nlarge earthen cylinder, with one of the ends knocked out, upon the\r\nground, and make it fast with clay or mud mortar, like \"setting a\r\ncopper.\" This always remains as much a fixture as a copper. When they\r\nwant to make bread, they fill it full of lighted date-palm branches, or\r\nother fuel. After the flame is extinguished, and the wood ashes have\r\nfallen to the bottom, the sides of the cylinder are heated red-hot. These\r\nsides are now rubbed round with a green palm-branch, and made clean. This\r\ndone, the paste or dough is pulled and made into small loaves like\r\npancakes, and clapped on the hot sides, until all the surface is covered,\r\nthe little cakes sticking on with great tenacity. The top of the cylinder\r\nis now covered over to retain the heat. In a few minutes the covering is\r\nremoved, and the new-baked bread is pulled or peeled off the sides of the\r\nfast-cooling cylinder. But sometimes there is heat for baking two batches\r\nof bread. Bread is frequently piled up, layer upon layer, like pancakes,\r\nin a bowl, and a strong highly-seasoned sauce with oil or liquid butter\r\nis poured upon it; from which bowl it is eaten, and called _âesh_, or\r\n\"the evening meal.\" Sometimes a number of very small pieces of meat is\r\nplaced on the pile of sopped bread; but this is a delicacy or luxury.\r\n\r\n_15th._--Went to call upon Hateetah, and met in the way a son of Abd\r\nErrahman of Ghadames, who has just returned from the oases of Touat. He\r\ndescribes Ain Salah (or Ensalah), to be like the country where the\r\nGovernor of Ghat resides, that is to say, sandy and surrounded with sand\r\nheaps, but abundantly supplied with water, as well as thickly populated.\r\nThe oases of Touat have unwalled towns, or scattered hamlets, but the\r\ncountry is perfectly secure. He gives the inhabitants a good character;\r\nthey are a mixture of Moors, Arabs, Touaricks, Berbers, and Negroes, like\r\nnearly all the oases in Central Sahara, or that portion of The Great\r\nDesert, extending from the oases of Fezzan to the Saharan towns of Arwan\r\nand Mabrouk, on the western-route line of Timbuctoo. He thinks I might\r\ntravel in safety from Touat to Timbuctoo in summer, for during the dry\r\nseason the banditti cannot keep the open Desert. Saw Hateetah, and gave\r\nhim a dollar, which put him into a better humour. Although the\r\n_soi-disant_ Consul of the English, and all the Christians who per hazard\r\nvisit Ghat, he displayed to-day the greatest ignorance of the maxims and\r\npolity of Christian nations. I thought it as well, since he assumed to be\r\nthe Representative of Her Majesty here in Ghat, just to remind him, (for\r\nI thought I had told him before,) there was a Queen in England, and that\r\nHer Majesty was his master. This greatly shocked Her Majesty's Touarghee\r\nConsul, and he asked, \"Whether the Queen cut off heads?\" I told Her\r\nMajesty's Consul, the servants of Government hanged murderers. The\r\nTouaricks have acquired these sanguinary notions of cutting off heads,\r\nfrom the reports of the Turkish and Moorish administration of justice.\r\nSuch barbarous practices do not exist amongst these barbarians. He then\r\ndemanded, \"Should I go to England, would the English seize me and beat\r\nme?\" This question from the English Consul really surprised me, whatever\r\nI might have expected from others, the vulgar error of Christians\r\nill-using Moslems, being spread in Sahara. People think, if they were to\r\nvisit Europe, we should capture them, beat them, and make them slaves.\r\nThis unfavourable opinion of us has descended from the times of the\r\nCrusaders, when European Christians displayed their zeal for\r\nChristianity--notwithstanding its holy doctrines teach the forgiveness of\r\ninjuries--by butchering or enslaving Jews, Mahometans, and heretics.\r\nThank God, the chivalry of those days is gone, though worse may yet come.\r\nTo-day, a mob of slaves, who idle about in the road to Hateetah, hooted\r\nafter me, and one of the biggest came upon me and pulled hold of my coat.\r\nI could not let this pass, the hooting I don't care about. So I fetched\r\nsome people to have the biggest fellow taken to Jabour. This we did to\r\nfrighten them, for after one of my friends gave him a crack over the\r\nhead, he was let off, promising to do so no more. The lower Moors and\r\nTouaricks, both here and at Ghadames, teach the slaves to call Christians\r\nkafer, \"infidel.\" The blacksmiths, near Hateetah's house, mostly salute\r\nme as I pass by them, with \"There's no God,\" &c. Sometimes they are\r\nextremely insolent. Any resistance to this zeal for The Prophet, would be\r\nputting your head into the fire. It would not be quite so bad if I did\r\nnot go out so much alone. I ought always to have a good strong fellow, an\r\nArab or Touarghee, with me, a sort of physical-force argument against\r\nthis moral hooting, which is intelligible everywhere, and more especially\r\nin The Desert. But as I soon leave, I do not wish to adopt any new\r\nmeasure, which would show want of confidence in the people.\r\n\r\nEvening visited my little queer friend Bel Kasem. Found with him as usual\r\nhis mighty lord, Khanouhen. The Prince began to ridicule Hateetah and his\r\nbrothers, and scold me on the subject of presents:--\"Yâkob, if you give\r\nthose rascally brothers of Hateetah presents, I shall have to spear you,\"\r\nclenching hold of his spear. \"_Kelāb_\" (dogs), said his jester, \"they'll\r\nstrip you of everything, leaving you no bread, nor even a water-skin, to\r\nreturn to Tripoli.\" I assured Khanouhen I had not given Hateetah's\r\nbrothers anything but a bit of sugar for some of their children. \"Good,\"\r\nsaid the Prince. Khanouhen now began in the style of _un esprit fort_:\r\n\"Yâkob, you're a Marabout. Our Marabouts are all rogues, and are always\r\nexciting the people against us and our authority (as Sultan). Are you\r\nsuch a rogue?\" Here was a glimpse of another contest between the civil\r\nand spiritual power in The Desert. I told the Sheikh I was no priest, but\r\na taleb. \"Ah! good,\" said the Prince, giving me his hand. \"But when you\r\ndie, where are you going to? Are you and I going together on the same\r\ncamel, or do you take one route of The Desert and I another, with\r\ndifferent camels?\" I replied, \"What is the use of such conjectures?\"\r\n\"Right,\" said the Prince, \"don't you remember (turning to Bel Kasem) that\r\nWahabite the people had here, and how they buffeted him, about? Yâkob,\r\n(turning to me) I saved a poor devil, a Wahabite, from being killed by\r\nthe mob in Ghat, and I'm ready to save you. What's the good of killing a\r\nman for his religion?\" I thanked the Prince for his noble feelings of\r\ntolerance, and left him and his clown to their _tête-à-tête_. Khanouhen\r\nis one of the few of those strong-minded and right-thinking men, who see\r\nthe utter folly and direful mischief of forging a creed for the\r\nconsciences of his fellows. Had he been a Christian prince of the times\r\nof Charles V., he would not, like that celebrated monarch, have passed\r\nall his life in binding the religious opinions of men in fetters, and\r\nthen at the end of his days, disgusted with his work, repented of his\r\nfolly. No, from the beginning of his career, Khanouhen would have\r\nproclaimed and defended with his sword the liberty of the human\r\nconscience in matters of religion.\r\n\r\n_16th._--A warm morning and hazy, but the much-dreaded wind got up at\r\nnoon. The departure of all the ghafalahs is now fixed for the 25th, and\r\nours for 23rd. The Rais of Ghadames has sent word for all his subjects to\r\nreturn together; this I'm sure they will not do. It is extremely\r\ndifficult to make up a large caravan. The Soudan caravan is now departing\r\nin small detachments of half a dozen people. Found Said crying to-day.\r\n\"What's the matter, Said?\" \"You are going to Soudan, the Touaricks will\r\nkill you and cut you into bits, and I shall be again made a slave. I wish\r\nto return to Ghadames with the Ghadamsee ghafalah.\" I had often caught\r\nSaid crying, and I imagine his grief came from the same source. I now\r\ntold him positively I was about to return to Fezzan, and never observed\r\nhim crying afterwards. As at Ghadames, Said is here a great man amongst\r\nthe lady negresses, and spends all his money in buying them needles and\r\nbeads. Hateetah called and scolded Said for crying, who had not yet dried\r\nhis tears. The Sheikh told him the Touaricks were better than the Turks\r\nor Arabs; and I supported Hateetah by reminding Said of what our friend\r\nEssnousee observed, \"_Targhee elkoul zain_, (all the Touaricks are good\r\nfellows).\" I now spoke to Hateetah seriously about devising some means\r\nfor stopping the progress of slave-caravans through the country. He\r\npretended that the profit derived from the slave-caravans was infinitely\r\ngreater than it is, making it some one thousand dollars per annum; he did\r\nnot think the Sheikhs would suppress it. \"They had carried it on always,\r\nand would for ever,\" he observed. \"But,\" he continued, and very justly,\r\n\"stop it at Constantinople, or at Tripoli, and then it will be stopped\r\nhere.\" Hateetah is right. This is and must be our plan, and I am happy to\r\nsee that Lord Palmerston has made, during the present year, a most\r\ndecisive effort near the Sublime Porte, to get the demand for slaves cut\r\noff at Tripoli and Constantinople, by the closing up of the\r\nslave-markets. Spent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. The Haj was occupied\r\nin making under-garments for the slaves he has purchased. Moors do\r\nstrange things. It is curious to see the richest and most extensively\r\noccupied merchant of the Souk sewing up shirts and chemises for his\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\n_17th._--Shafou left this morning for the country districts. The quiet\r\nold gentleman has had enough of the bustle of the Souk, which still\r\ncontinues. His Highness, before his departure, arranged for the Queen's\r\nletter and the presents. Called early upon the Governor, and found him in\r\nthe house of Khanouhen, where there was a full assembly of Sheikhs. I was\r\nobliged to talk politics with them, which were translated as the\r\nconversation proceeded, by the Governor himself, to the Sheikhs. I\r\nsurprised them by telling them of the great number of Mussulman troops\r\nemployed by the French in Algeira, and how the French Government paid all\r\nthe priests of religion, even Mussulmans. They questioned me about, and I\r\nexplained to them the existence of deism in France and Europe. Now and\r\nthen a solitary Mussulman deist may be found in North Africa. But how few\r\nhave courage enough to resist the divine mission of The Prophet! Still\r\nfewer question the probability of a Revelation. In general conversation,\r\nI have always despised the system of running down the Algerian French,\r\nwhilst travelling in these wilds. It serves no earthly purpose, but to\r\nincrease the arrogance of the Moors and Arabs against Christians of all\r\nnations. Whatever the conduct of the Algerian French, the conquest may\r\nhave a salutary influence upon Saharan fanatics, though it increases the\r\ndanger of the European traveller. The Moorish Governments of the coast\r\ndeserve much censure. They often foster and fan the flame of fanaticism\r\nagainst European tourists. Besides, the conduct of the Maroquines towards\r\nthe Jews ought not now to be permitted by the Governments of France and\r\nEngland. A missionary to the Jews, (himself a converted Jew,) who visited\r\nTangier with me, could not help exclaiming, on seeing how badly the\r\nnative Jews were treated, \"God give the French success in Algeria!\" It\r\nis difficult for a philanthropic mind to suppress such feelings, whatever\r\nour national prejudices, and how much soever we may brand the Razzias as\r\nan indelible stigma on European civilization. It would be better, and\r\ncertainly more just, to civilize North Africa by civilizing the\r\nestablished Moorish Governments of The Coast. But if The Coast is to fall\r\nunder European domination, it is to be hoped England will secure the Bay\r\nof Tunis for shipping, and the Regency of Tripoli, as being the natural\r\nroute of Saharan commerce. The rest may be safely left to France,\r\nexcepting our old military post of Tangier, in order to maintain our\r\ninfluence through the Straits of Gibraltar. The conversation of the\r\nSheikhs at length turned upon the Turks, and the country of Gog and\r\nMagog--whence they came, whom we all agreed to abuse as much as possible,\r\nsince our antipathies were pretty equal. The Sheikhs then began very\r\nnaturally to vaunt of their power in The Sahara, and I may embrace this\r\nopportunity of giving some outline of the Touarick nations of The Great\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\nThe Arab and Moorish writers of the middle ages, as well as the latest\r\nSaharan pilgrims, who have travelled The Desert from the shores of\r\nthe Atlantic to the banks of the Nile, have all given us brief\r\nnotices of the Touarick nations; but they have sometimes confounded\r\nTouaricks with strictly Berber tribes, and indeed, not without\r\nreason, for apparently the Touarick and Berber tribes are descended\r\nfrom one original family, or stock of people. The fairest conclusion\r\nis, that they are the descendants of the ancient Numidian tribes.\r\nThe Arabic terms employed here to name the Touaricks are ‮توارق‬\r\nplural and ‮توارقي‬ singular. Vulgarly a Touarick is called\r\n_Targhee_ (‮ترقي‬), by the Touaricks themselves, as well as by the\r\nMoors and Arabs. Indeed, Targhee is the more correct name, and\r\nTouarghee is an enlarged Arabic form. So Leo Africanus speaks of\r\nthese tribes of The Desert as \"Targa Popolo.\"\r\n\r\nThe extent of Sahara occupied by the Touaricks is exceedingly great,\r\nembracing many thousands of miles. The northern line begins at Ghadames,\r\nan hour's journey south of that city. This line extends along the north,\r\nsouth-west as far as Touat, and south-east as far as the oases of Fezzan\r\nand Ghat. On the western side, proceeding directly south, we find\r\nTouaricks on the whole line of route as far as Timbuctoo; on the eastern\r\nside, leaving Ghat, and journeying southward, they abound in the populous\r\ndistricts of Aheer and Asbenouwa, as far as Damerghou, the first purely\r\nNegro kingdom of Negroland. On the south, they are scattered in villages\r\nand towns, or wandering in tribes, along the north banks of The Niger. I\r\nhave not heard of their being located on the southern banks of the great\r\nriver of Soudan, nor do they descend the Niger to the Atlantic, for we\r\nhear nothing of them in Noufee or Rabbah. But they are scattered higher\r\nup through the extensive provinces of Housa, subjected to the Fullans.\r\n\r\nIn The Sahara, comprehended by these immense lines, they have some large\r\ncities and agricultural districts. The principal of them are Ghat, Aheer,\r\nand Aghadez, in the east, Touat and Timbuctoo, in the west. We have the\r\nthree principal cities of Ghat, Aheer, and Aghadez, besides numerous\r\nvillages, in Western Sahara, entirely under the authority of the\r\nTouaricks. Everywhere they inhabit the agricultural districts of the\r\nopen desert. I have not heard of Touaricks on the western line of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. Captain Riley speaks only of wandering Arabs, almost in a\r\nwild state. On the eastern line of The Desert, they do not extend beyond\r\nthe western limits of the oases of Fezzan, and the southern Tibboo\r\ncountries. The names of the great sections of the Touaricks, as far as I\r\nhave been able to learn, are,--\r\n\r\n1st. The _Azghar_--‮ازقار‬--of Ghat.\r\n2nd. The _Haghar_--‮هقار‬--of Touat.\r\n3rd. The _Kylouy_[88]--‮كيلوي‬--of Aheer.\r\n4th. The _Sorghou_--‮سرقو‬--of Timbuctoo.\r\n\r\nThe Sorghou is the Timbuctoo name which is given to them by Caillié, and\r\nprobably this is not a distinct section from that of the Haghar[89].\r\nThere are some lofty ranges of mountains between Ghat and Touat called\r\nalso Haghar, the nucleus of these tribes, and whose Sultan is the\r\nGigantic Bassa. Besides, we have the Touaricks of Fezzan, a very small\r\nsection and distinct from those of Ghat, and who may be considered the\r\npastoral people, the veritable Arcadians of the oases. All these sections\r\nhave their respective Sultans, and the Sultans their respective\r\nsubordinate Sheikhs, governing the respective subdivision of territory\r\nand tribes of people. The subdivisions of Ghat tribes are the\r\nfollowing:--Tinilleum, Aiaum, Dugarab, Sacana, Dugabakar, Auragan,\r\nMuasatan, Ghiseban, Elararan, Filelen, Francanan, Botanetum, Skinimen,\r\nDeradrinan, Mucarahsen, Keltrubran, Keltunii, Chelgenet, Ilemtein[90].\r\nThese various sections of Touaricks, who wander through the vast\r\nwilderness of Sahara, or are located in its oases, may be distinguished\r\nby some general characteristics, agreeing with and arising from their\r\npeculiar location, or habits of trade and life. The Touaricks of\r\nTimbuctoo are the more faithless and sanguinary in their disposition, and\r\nless addicted to commerce or a regular mode of life. Those of Ghat\r\nrepresent the Touarghee character in its most original type, these tribes\r\nbeing a brave and hardy people, reserved and using few words in speech,\r\nof a noble chivalric disposition, and carrying on some commerce. Those of\r\nTouat, I imagine, are the same style of people, from what few of them I\r\nsaw at Ghadames; but those of Aheer are more effeminate and milder in\r\ntheir manners, and are a good deal mixed with the Negro nations of\r\nSoudan. The Touaricks of Aheer bear an excellent character as traders,\r\nand companions of travel, always assisting the stranger first at the\r\nwell, before their own camels are watered. They seem, besides, mostly\r\naddicted to the peaceful pursuits of commerce, if we except their\r\noccasionally joining in the Razzias for slaves. A full third of the\r\ntraffic of the South-eastern Sahara is in their hands, or under their\r\ncontrol. I may add a few words upon their country and chief places, Aheer\r\nand Aghadez.\r\n\r\n_Aheer_, or _Ahir_, ‮اهير‬ and which is often incorrectly spelt on\r\nthe maps Aïr, is the name of a town and very populous district,\r\nincluding within its territory or jurisdiction the city of\r\nAghadez. Aheer is also called Azben, and its district Azbenouwa\r\n‮ازبنوة‬--‮ازبن‬ which appear to have been the more\r\nancient names. The town of Aheer is also called _Asouty_,\r\n‮اسوطي‬ on the maps Asouda, the dentals ‮ط‬ and ‮د‬\r\nbeing convertible. These districts are bounded on the north by Ghat and\r\nits tribes; on the east by the Tibboo country and Bornou, on the\r\nwest by the Negro, Touarick and Fullan countries of the north banks\r\nof the Niger; and on the south, by the Housa districts, vulgarly\r\ncalled by merchants, Soudan. Aheer is forty short days from Ghat,\r\nthe Soudanese merchants who visit the Ghat mart always travelling\r\nmuch more _doucement_ and in jog-trot style than the Moorish and\r\nArab merchants of the north. The line of the Aheer stations measures\r\nabout thirteen days, from Tidik in the north to Toktouft in the\r\nsouth[91]. In this portion of the route, and that previous to\r\narriving at Tidik, there are twenty days of mountains. The Aheer\r\nroute also abounds with springs and fine streams, which gush out\r\nfrom the base of rock-lands of great height, and some of which form\r\nconsiderable rivers for several months in the year, on whose banks\r\ncorn and the senna-plant are cultivated. Aheer is the Saharan region\r\nof senna, where there are large wadys covered with its crops. The\r\nexportation, especially after a season of rain, is very great and\r\nprofitable. Asouty is the principal town of the Aheer districts, and\r\nwas formerly the capital of all the Kylouy Touaricks. No less than a\r\nthousand houses are now seen abandoned and in ruins. Here in former\r\ntimes all the Soudan trade was carried on and concentrated; its\r\npopulation is still considerable. The houses are nearly all\r\nconstructed of hasheesh, or straw huts, and the city is without\r\nwalls. Nevertheless, the people still honour it with the title of\r\n_Blad es-Sultan_, \"City,\" or \"Country of the Sultan,\" that is, where\r\nthe Sultan occasionally resides, answering to our _Royal_ city.\r\n\r\nAheer is the rendezvous of the salt caravan of Bilma, in the Tibboo\r\ncountry, situate, almost in a straight line, about ten days east, the\r\nroute to which is over barren stony ground. A curious story is told of\r\nthe manner in which the camel drivers supply themselves with forage over\r\nthis treeless, herbless, naked waste. On their way to Bilma, they leave\r\nat certain places or stations a quantity of forage to supply them on\r\ntheir return; and it is said, the deposit is sacred, no one daring to\r\ntouch it. It is probable, however, that the forage is concealed in hiding\r\nplaces, as wells are often hidden along some desert routes. Even in the\r\nTunisian Jereed, the sources of water are frequently concealed, a skin\r\nbeing placed over the water with palm branches laid thereupon, and the\r\ntop of the well's mouth covered with sand. So that a hapless traveller\r\nmay perish of thirst with water under his feet! Through the hunting\r\ndistricts of South Africa, amongst the Namaquas, the sources of water are\r\nconcealed in a similar manner. However, a short time ago, the people of\r\nBornou, who were then at war with the Touaricks of Aheer, discovered the\r\nhiding places of the Touaricks' forage, carried off or destroyed the\r\nsupplies, and reduced a large salt-caravan to the greatest extremities;\r\nhundreds of camels perished from hunger. These salt-caravans are\r\nsometimes a thousand and two thousand strong. The greater part of Housa\r\nand the neighbouring provinces is supplied with salt from Bilma.\r\n\r\nAghadez, ‮اقدز‬ is the capital of the Aheer districts. This is the\r\nresidence of the Sultan of the Touaricks of South-eastern Sahara.\r\nThe present Sultan is called _Mazouwaja_, ‮مزواجى‬ who is\r\nrepresented as a friendly prince. But it was _En-Nour_ ‮النور‬,\r\ndeputy Sultan of Aheer, to whom I wrote before leaving Ghat, begging\r\nhis protection in the event of my return, to complete the tour to\r\nSoudan. Aghadez is now as large as Tripoli, or containing from eight\r\nto ten thousand inhabitants. In a past period it was four times as\r\nlarge. A great number of the people have emigrated to Soudan, where\r\nless labour is required to till the soil, and nature is more lavish\r\nin her productions. Aghadez is a walled city, but without any\r\nparticular strength; the houses are but one story high, built of mud\r\nand stone and sun-dried bricks. Aghadez abounds in provisions of the\r\nmost substantial kind, that is, sheep, oxen and grain. The\r\ngovernment is despotic, but the lesser chiefs have great power in\r\ntheir respective districts, like those of Ghat. The religion of the\r\npeople is Mahometan; not a Pagan, Jew, or Christian, is found within\r\nthese districts. Trade is carried on to a great extent, and Moorish\r\nmerchants visit Aghadez, proceeding no further towards Soudan. The\r\nmost interesting district near Aghadez is that of _Bagzem_ ‮بقزم‬,\r\n(or _Magzem_, the labials ‮ب‬ and ‮م‬ being convertible,)\r\nconsisting of an exceedingly lofty mountain, requiring a full day's\r\njourney for its ascent. This mountain figures on the map under the\r\nancient name of Usugala Mons, but for what reason God knows. The\r\ntown is placed a good way towards its loftiest heights, the most of\r\nwhich heights are both cultivated and inhabited, and there is\r\nabundance of trees, grain, and fruits. Bagzem is three days' journey\r\nfrom Asouty.\r\n\r\nI shall take the liberty of appending the account given of Aheer and\r\nAghadez by Leo Africanus:--\r\n\r\n\r\nDISERTO DOVE ABITA TARGA POPOLO.\r\n\r\n     Il terzo diserto incomincia da'confini di Air dal lato di\r\n     ponente, e s'estende fino al diserto d'Ighidi verso Levante; e di\r\n     verso tramontana confina con li diserti di Tuat e di Tegorarin e\r\n     di Mezab; da mezzogiorno, con li diserti vicini al regno di\r\n     Agadez. Questo diserto non è cosi aspro e crudele, como sono i\r\n     due primieri: e truovavisi acqua buona, e pozzi profondissimi;\r\n     massimamente vicino ad Air, nel quale è un temperato diserto e di\r\n     buono aere, dove nascono molte erbe: e più oltre, vicino di\r\n     Agadez, si truova assai manna, che è cosa mirable; e gli\r\n     abitatori vanno la mattina pertempto a raccorlo, e ve n'empiono\r\n     certe zucche; e vendonla cosi fresca nella città di Agadez; e un\r\n     fiasco che tien un boccale val due bajocchi; beesi mescolata con\r\n     acqua; ed è cosa perfettissima: la mescolano ancora nelle\r\n     minestre, e rinfresca molto: penso che per tale cagione li\r\n     forestieri rade volte s'ammalano in Agadez, come in Tombutto,\r\n     ancorchè vi sia aere pestifero. Questo diserto s'estende da\r\n     tramontana verso mezzogiorno trecento miglia.--_Sixth Part_, lvi.\r\n     _chap._\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, that under the name of _Targa Popolo_, no mention is\r\nmade of the Touaricks of Ghat. Indeed, all the notices of the Renegade\r\nTourist on this part of Africa, are extremely meagre and unsatisfactory.\r\nAs to his divisions of The Sahara into so many deserts, 1st, 2nd, 3rd,\r\n&c., this is all arbitrary and most unnatural. The story about the\r\nabundance of manna gathered in the districts of Aheer, seems to have been\r\ninvented to please the Christian doctors of Rome; at any rate, nothing of\r\nthe kind is now seen or known at Aghadez. But with respect to foreigners\r\nwho visit Aheer and Aghadez enjoying good health, I have no doubt the\r\nRenegade is correct, for I have not heard of either of these places being\r\nunhealthy, their salubrity arising, we may imagine, from the elevation at\r\nwhich they are placed. The Aheer Saharan region is emphatically\r\nmountainous.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, visited Hateetah, who has made up his mind to accompany me to\r\nFezzan, of which I'm glad, not wishing to meet with any more Ouweeks in\r\nthis neighbourhood. Was pleased this morning to observe amongst the\r\nchildren of Haj Ahmed, who were busy reading passages from the Koran,\r\nseveral girls. This circumstance raises my opinion of the Governor. No\r\ndoubt it is because he is a Marabout that he grants this privilege to his\r\ndaughters. The Marabout has no less than a dozen small children, of all\r\ncomplexions, features, and hues, from lily white to sooty black. My\r\nsweetest enjoyment in Ghat is to listen to the song of the tiny singing\r\nsparrows hopping about my terrace. My days of childhood return with their\r\nsong, when, if I were not innocent, a little matter made me happy. Sing\r\non you pretty little things, tune your wild Saharan notes, for you\r\ngladden my sad heart!\r\n\r\n_18th._--A fine warm sunny day. The departure of the ghafalah is now\r\nfixed for the 27th. According to some accounts, 8000 Touaricks are being\r\nmustered, to march against the Shânbah. The Touaricks evidently expect\r\nthe robber tribe to be reinforced from Souf and the Warklah districts, or\r\nthe robbers must number 5000 instead of 500. Haj Ibrahim tells me, he has\r\njust read a letter addressed by the Pasha of Tripoli to the united\r\nSheikhs of Ghat, offering them assistance against the robber tribe. The\r\nTouaricks have politely declined the proffered aid, feeling strong (and\r\nwise) enough to manage their own battles. Not much troubled with visitors\r\nlately, one now and then. The Touaricks are leaving Ghat to reinforce the\r\nnew levies of troops. Soon the town will be emptied of Touaricks. The\r\nGhadamsee ghafalah is returning, and a small one to Tripoli _viâ_ Shaty\r\nand Misdah.\r\n\r\nHaj Ibrahim continues to repeat his story about the people of Ghadames\r\nhaving a great deal of money hoarded up. I visited him this morning, and\r\nfound him surrounded with a group of Soudanese merchants. The large\r\ncourt-yard of his house was full of bales of unsold goods, here and there\r\nscattered about, and some unpacked, all in the most business-like\r\ndisorder. In one quarter was a cluster of a dozen slaves, waiting to be\r\nbartered for, the poor wretches being huddled up together in this private\r\nmart of human flesh. The Moor was calm and collected amidst the dirt and\r\nnoise of Kanou and Succatou merchants, who with violent gestures were\r\ndisputing the progress of the bargain inch by inch. Here was a great\r\nassortment of rubbish, for I can't call very coarse paper, green baize\r\ncloth, glass and earthen composition beads, bad razors, and a few common\r\nwoollens, and some very inferior raw silk, merchandize. And such rubbish\r\nwas offered in exchange for a group of God's creatures, with his divine\r\nimage stamped upon them! At length the progress of the bargain came to\r\nwhat might be called a crisis. The Soudanese merchants jumped up\r\nsuddenly, with shouts and curses, as if they had discovered a perfidious\r\nfraud, and rushed to the door, pulling their miserable slaves after them.\r\nI felt shocked at the sight, and my horror must have been depicted in my\r\ncountenance. For Haj Ibrahim, who well knew I disapproved of this\r\ntraffic, said to me angrily, \"Why do you come here now?\" I got out of his\r\nway as quick as I could, but did not leave the house. The people of the\r\nMoor followed hard after the runaway merchants, seizing first hold of\r\ntheir slaves, dragging them back by main force into the court-yard. Then\r\ntheir owners raised a hideous cry, calling Haj Ibrahim and his people\r\n\"thieves,\" and \"robbers,\" and \"cheats,\" and \"accursed,\" and many other\r\nsimilar compliments in the way of slave-dealing. This would make a nice\r\ncounter-picture to a sketch of one of those Congressional squabbles which\r\nso frequently take place on the presentation of Anti-Slavery petitions to\r\nthe American Congress, when there is an occasional flourish of the\r\nbowie-knife, and a good deal of expectoration to damp the ardour of the\r\ncombatants, fighting over the victims of Republican Tyranny. After this\r\ncame a cessation of every kind of noise, for Haj Ibrahim, disgusted with\r\nthe business, (he was a fair-dealing man though a slave-dealer,) said to\r\nOmer, his Arab servant:--\"Tell them to be off, and take their slaves with\r\nthem.\" Now interposed a merchant of Ghat, and a friend of the Soudanese,\r\nwho thus upbraided them:--\"Fools that you are! Do you think Haj Ibrahim\r\nis a cheat? Haj Ibrahim gets nothing by you; Haj Ibrahim buys your\r\nslaves, because Haj Ibrahim will not be at the expense of carrying his\r\ngoods back again to Tripoli.\" The merchants replied, and I dare say with\r\ntruth:--\"You told us 300, now there are only 200; 20 of this, and only\r\n10; 50 of that, and only 20,\" &c. This Ghatee was a broker, and a species\r\nof sharper; he had been impudently imposing on the Housa merchants. But,\r\nto cut a long story short, the bargain was finally arranged. Haj Ibrahim\r\nmade these quondam merchants a present of some almonds and parched peas,\r\n\"to _wet_ the bargain.\" The poor slaves had been dressed up for the sale,\r\nand, with other ornaments, large bright iron hoops had been hammered\r\nround their ancles. It was a tough job to get them off, and a blacksmith\r\nonly could do it. Haj Ibrahim called each new slave to him, and looked at\r\ntheir features, in order to know them. This he told me he was obliged to\r\ndo, to be sure of his own slaves, and prevent quarrels with other\r\nmerchants, for the slaves often get mixed together.\r\n\r\nDuring Souk there is going on some petty thieving, mostly done by the\r\nNegro slaves and Arab camel-drivers. They have stolen many little things\r\nfrom me. It is useless to complain. One must take care of one's things.\r\nBut I am informed the Touaricks never steal. At any rate, large bundles\r\nof senna are left out in the suburbs, night after night, and in the open\r\nfields amongst the sand, and no one touches a leaf of it. This could\r\nneither be done in Tunis, nor in Tripoli. The Touaricks are beggars, but\r\nnot thieves; they will also beg hard and with authority. Rarely,\r\nhowever, will a Touarghee take anything away from you without your\r\nknowledge. So, if Touaricks are poor, they are honest, which is so seldom\r\nthe case, poverty exciting as much or more to crime than exuberant\r\nwealth. On the whole, this country must be considered free from crime.\r\nHungry slaves pilfering about, can hardly be designated crime. I saw a\r\nlittle slave to-day, who had just been brought from Aheer; he was rolling\r\nnaked on the sand, with some fresh green blades of wheat before him.\r\nThese he was devouring, and this was his food. How can human beings fed\r\nthis way be expected to refrain from stealing food when they have an\r\nopportunity? The Touaricks of Aheer, though not cruel masters, feed their\r\nslaves mostly on herbage, which is picked up _en route_. At least, so the\r\npeople tell me.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, the aged Berka paid me a visit. I gave him his tobacco, or\r\nthat which I had promised him. Whenever you promise a person anything in\r\nthis country, in reminding you of it, if you forget your promise, he\r\ncalls the article his own, and demands it as a right. Berka can hardly\r\nmove about, he is so very old a man; I should say the Sheikh is upwards\r\nof a hundred. The Saharan veteran made no observation in particular. He\r\nreplied to my questions about Saharan travelling:--\"Don't fear, the\r\nTouaricks will do you no harm. You can go to Timbuctoo in safety.\" I was\r\nmaking ghusub water, and asked him to drink of it. \"No,\" he said, smiling\r\nwith benignity, \"you must drink ghusub water with me, not I with you.\r\nThis is the fashion of us Touaricks.\" Ghusub water, is water poured on\r\nghusub grain after the grain has been par-boiled or otherwise prepared. A\r\nmilky substance oozes from the grain, and makes a very cooling pleasant\r\nbeverage. Saharan merchants prize the ghusub water chiefly for its\r\ncooling quality in summer. A few dates are pounded with the ghusub to\r\ngive the drink a sweeter and more unctuous taste. The aged Sheikh, on\r\ntaking leave, begged a little bit of white sugar. \"I wish to give it to\r\nmy little grandson,\" he added. I question which was the more childish, he\r\nor his little grandson, so true it is the intellect decays as it grows,\r\nspite of our theories of the immortality of mind. I have now had visits\r\nfrom all the great chieftains of the Ghat Touaricks, Shafou, Jabour,\r\nBerka, and Khanouhen. The three former are the heads of the great\r\ndivisions of confederated tribes. These centres of the large tribes and\r\nfamilies separately constitute an oligarchical nobility, by which the\r\ndestinies of this Saharan world are governed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82] _Ghafouly_--‮قفولي‬--_Holcus sorghum_, (Linn). Ghafouly\r\n    grows higher than a man; the stalk is as thick round as\r\n    sugar-cane; the grain is of white colour, and half the size of a\r\n    dry pea, of a round flattened shape. It is much coarser eating\r\n    than maize.\r\n\r\n[83] _Arachis hypogæa_, (Linn). This shell fruit has two names in\r\n    Housa, _goújĕeă_, and _gaýda_. Many of the shells are double; they\r\n    are smallish, very soft, and easily broken. The taste of the fruit\r\n    is not disagreeable, a good deal like the almond, but more viscid,\r\n    and a little insipid.\r\n\r\n[84] Mostly with the mark \"_porco_\" on the packets.\r\n\r\n[85] Mostly with the mark \"_tre lune_\" on it. I complained to a\r\n    merchant that the paper was very coarse, and asked him why he did\r\n    not purchase finer paper. He replied, \"_It's all the same in\r\n    Soudan, fine or coarse._\" The same answer would be given to every\r\n    complaint about the coarseness and bad quality of these imports\r\n    into Africa. Fine or coarse cloth, and fine or coarse silk, sell\r\n    much the same in Negroland.\r\n\r\n[86] This is frequently the case. When a Touarghee wears his\r\n    _litham_, and when he pulls it off, he undergoes a complete\r\n    metamorphosis, so that strangers cannot recognize the parties in\r\n    their change of dress.\r\n\r\n[87] ‮איש בץניו הישר יעשה‬ Judges xxi. 25. The conduct\r\n    of the Sheikhs and their tribes is much like that of the\r\n    Israelites under the Judges.\r\n\r\n[88] Sometimes called, Killiwah.\r\n\r\n[89] Different Negro tribes call Touaricks by different names.\r\n\r\n[90] These names are but imperfectly given, and they must be\r\n    pronounced in Italian style, being written from the dictation of a\r\n    Targhee chief by Mr. Gagliuffi, according to that language. To\r\n    these may be added _Haioun_, a tribe of Marabouts.\r\n\r\n[91] For the rest of the Stations see the Map.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCONTINUED RESIDENCE IN GHAT.\r\n\r\n     Parallels between The Desert and The East.--The Divine Warranty\r\n     for carrying on the Slave Trade discussed.--Visit from Aheer and\r\n     Soudanese Merchants, and present state of Soudan.--Form of the\r\n     Cross on Touarick Arms.--Boy taught to curse The\r\n     Christian.--Medina Shereef's opinion on my giving Presents.--A\r\n     Negress begs in the name of Ouweek.--Visit to the Governor and\r\n     Hateetah.--Streams of Water and Corn-Fields in the Fabled Region\r\n     of Saharan Desolation.--Kandarka will recommend me to his\r\n     Sultan.--Parallel things between Africa and Asia.--Atkee turns\r\n     out a Scamp.--Visit from Berka.--Arabic is the Language of\r\n     Heaven.--Khanouhen ridicules Hateetah to his face.--Hospitality\r\n     of the Governor towards me, and interesting Conversations with\r\n     him.--Moorish reckoning of Time clashes with mine.--Medina\r\n     Shereef turns Beggar like the rest.--Meet The Giant begging at\r\n     Haj Ibrahim's.--Affecting Case of the cruelty of one Slave to\r\n     another, and compared to the Jews of Morocco.--Chorus Singing of\r\n     the Slaves.--Mode in which Ostriches are Hunted.--Arrival of\r\n     Senna and Ivory from Aheer.--Christians are not Liars.--Farewell\r\n     Visit from Jabour.--Quick Route to Timbuctoo from Ghat.--Kandarka\r\n     turns Comedian, and satirizes the Touaricks of Ghat.--Mercantile\r\n     Transactions of the Governor.--Want of a strong Government in The\r\n     Desert.--Assemblage of the Sheikhs, and preparations for War.\r\n\r\n\r\n_19th._--DID not go out to-day, but amused myself with noting down in the\r\njournal several parallel things between The Desert and The East, which\r\nare mentioned in The Scriptures.\r\n\r\n\"And she said, As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but an\r\nhandful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and, behold, I\r\nam gathering two sticks, that I may go and dress it for me and my son,\r\nthat we may eat it, and die.\" (1 Kings xvii. 12.) We have in Sahara\r\nparallel ideas to all and every part of this simple and affecting\r\ndiscourse. The widow speaks with an oath. When anything particular and\r\nextraordinary is to be said or done, the people of Sahara must use an\r\noath. The meal is the barley-meal of our people; the oil is used to cook\r\nit as we cook our bazeen. The sticks are gathered from The Desert every\r\nday to dress our food. The blank and absolute resignation of the woman is\r\nthe same with every one here, not excepting those of immoral lives.\r\n\r\n\"And lo in her mouth, was an olive-leaf plucked off,\" (Gen. viii. 11.)\r\n\"And Noah began to be a husbandman, and he planted a vineyard,\" (Gen. ix.\r\n20.) The olive and the vine are still the choice fruit-trees in North\r\nAfrica, and were the Mussulmans a wine-drinking people, the country would\r\nbe covered with vineyards. In the beautiful parable of Jotham, (Judges\r\nix. 8-15,) the third, and the three choicest trees of North Africa are\r\nseparately mentioned, the olive, the fig-tree, and the vine. These are\r\nthe only fruits valued or cultivated by Tripoline Arabs in their\r\nmountains. The jennah or \"paradise\" of the Koran is also planted with\r\n\"palm trees and vines.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.\" (2 Sam. ii. 18.) In this\r\nway Arabs speak of one another. Every person who is conversant with\r\nEastern pictures and scenes in Arabic has met with a scrap of poetry of\r\nsome sort or other, in which the Arab woos his mistress, by comparing her\r\nloved eyes to the fine dark full eye of the gazelle. An Arab also, like\r\nus Europeans, calls a cunning fellow \"an old fox,\" and stupid fellow \"a\r\ndonkey.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it came to pass, in an evening tide, that David arose from off his\r\nbed, and walked upon the roof of the king's house; and from the roof he\r\nsaw a woman washing herself, and the woman was very beautiful to look\r\nupon.\" (2 Sam. xi. 2.) Everybody now knows, or ought to know, that the\r\nroofs of Barbary and Saharan houses are flat, where the people walk and\r\nenjoy \"the cool of the evening,\" or \"the evening tide\" after getting up\r\nfrom their naps or siestas. Here the women gossip and the men pray, but\r\nthe latter are often disturbed in their devotions by the intruding\r\nglimpses of some Desert beauty. Love-matches and intrigues are equally\r\nconcerted here on house-tops. The flat-roofed house-top, as before\r\nobserved, is the Ghadamsee woman's entire world; here she lives, and\r\nmoves, and has her being.\r\n\r\n\"Woe to thee, O land,\" &c., \"And thy princes eat in the morning.\"\r\n(Eccles. xi. 16.) The principal meal is in the evening, and no people of\r\nthese countries think of eating a hearty meal \"in the morning\" like what\r\nEuropeans are accustomed to eat in the morning. To eat a hearty meal in\r\nthe morning would be an act of downright gluttony. Here, then, is\r\nstrikingly brought out the sense of this passage of the Preacher's\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n\"We will not drink of the waters of the well.\" (Numbers xxi. 22.) The\r\nIsraelites being a numerous host, were obliged to make this promise, for\r\nif all had drank, they would soon have emptied the wells, and left the\r\npeople of the country without water, and their flocks and cattle to die\r\nof thirst. The caravans now returning to Ghadames are obliged to go in\r\nvery small numbers, that they may not exhaust the wells. Having many\r\nslaves with them more water is required, which they cannot in any way\r\ndispense with. The Israelites renewed their promises about the drinking\r\nof the water to other people, through whose country they had to pass.\r\n\r\n\"He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha!\" (Job xxxix. 25.) It is very odd\r\nthat the horsemen of Morocco, when they gallop to the charge, always cry\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" So the Arabian poet of The Book of Job puts the wild cry of the\r\nrider into the mouth of the horse whom he rides. This I frequently\r\nwitnessed on the parade of Mogador. The wild cavalry of Morocco is the\r\nboldest idea transmitted to us of the ancient Numidian horse. In Morocco\r\nthe horse is both the sacred animal and the bulwark of the empire; for\r\nthis reason it is the Emperor prohibits the exportation of horses. Even\r\nthe barley, on which the horses are generally fed, is not allowed to be\r\nexported for the same reasons.\r\n\r\n    ‮ויאמר ארור כנען עבד עבדים לאחיו‬\r\n\r\n\"And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be to his\r\nbrethren,\" (Gen. ix. 25.) This portion of Scripture will occur naturally\r\nenough to the mind of a biblical reader, who takes up his residence for\r\nsome weeks at a slave-mart, and is seeing slaves bought and sold every\r\nday. It is the famous and much abused text of the slave dealers of the\r\nlast three centuries, and is now continually quoted in the pulpits of the\r\nUnited States parsons, who, like the devil himself, quote Scripture to\r\nsupport the wickedness of themselves and their slave-holding and\r\nman-selling countrymen. The most approved commentators properly apply the\r\ntext to the Canaanites, whom Providence afterwards dispossessed of their\r\nterritories in Palestine, and gave them to the children of Shem, and so\r\nthe Canaanites became the slaves of the Shemites for a limited period.\r\nBut to prove that it does not refer to the Negroes of North and Central\r\nAfrica, I may be allowed to produce the following reasons:--\r\n\r\n1st. Of all the children of Ham, Canaan only is mentioned.\r\n\r\n2nd. The prophecy was fulfilled in the descendants of Canaan, and there\r\nis no occasion to extend it beyond the early history of the Jews, when\r\nthey took possession of the land of Canaan, and reduced its people to\r\nservitude.\r\n\r\n3rd. The descendants of Canaan were all white people, and the Negroes I\r\nneed not say are black. But if it be a question of colour, there are red\r\nIndians and black Indians, who have been from unknown ages the sons of\r\nfreedom, and who, when discovered, would not and could not be reduced to\r\nslavery. I guess the Yankees have not reduced the Indians to slavery,\r\n(although, after robbing them of their hunting-grounds, they have in the\r\nmost Christian spirit exterminated many,) on the contrary, they are\r\nequally free men with the Yankees, and have the same privilege of\r\nreducing free men to slavery with their Republican neighbours. The Black\r\nIndians, following the precept and example of the White Republicans, have\r\nnow an immense number of slaves; and in this case, it is not the more\r\ncivilized who holds his fellow man in bondage, but the less civilized,\r\nindeed, savages. So the world is improving and progressing in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere! The Southern Ocean is peopled with many tribes as\r\nblack as Negroes. But to return to the Canaanites, they at length mixed\r\nwith the Israelites and became one people, and the relations of master\r\nand slave were lost in equality.\r\n\r\n4th. Many of the descendants also of Cush were white people, for he was\r\nthe father of Nimrod, who founded Babylon, and became the father of all\r\nthe Babylonians. Were the Babylonians Negroes?\r\n\r\n5th. None of the children of Ham, but Canaan, became servants or rather\r\nslaves to the rest of the human race in any remarkable degree, during the\r\nearly period of the Mosaic world. For,\r\n\r\nCush was the alleged father of the Babylonians and the Ethiopians, (the\r\npeople of Upper Egypt,) but neither of these nations were slaves to\r\nconquerors more than any other people of that period of the world;\r\nwhilst, on the other hand, the Babylonians were great conquerors in their\r\nday, and the Ethiopians had princes of their own even down to the days of\r\nSolomon. If now the Abyssinians are to be considered the descendants of\r\nthe Ethiopians, we all know they are not slaves, but like the Yankee\r\nStates themselves, slave-dealers and slave-holders. The Abyssinians,\r\nmoreover, enjoyed advantages of civilization when a great portion of\r\nEurope was overwhelmed with barbarism. So much for the Cushites and\r\nEthiopians, the lineal descendants of the accursed Ham!\r\n\r\nMizraim was the father of the Egyptians. These ancient and celebrated\r\npeople, whose country was the cradle of civilization, cannot surely be\r\nbranded as the slaves of the human race! This was also the lineal\r\ndescendant of the accursed Ham!\r\n\r\n6th. But even the Canaanites, so far from remaining slaves, after the\r\nalleged curse was fulfilled in them, recovered from their degradation and\r\nrose into consequence, filling the world with their fame. The children of\r\nCanaan were undoubtedly the founders of Tyre, whose bold navigators,\r\nbraving the ocean and the tempest, scoured and ploughed up the waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean, planting colonies everywhere, and founded Carthage!\r\nThe Carthaginians, their more renowned sons, passed the Straits of the\r\ncolumns of Hercules, doubled Cape Spartel, and, some say, coasted the\r\nentire continent of Africa, returning by the Red Sea. It is monstrous to\r\ncall such people slaves, branded by the hereditary curse of the\r\ninebriated patriarch of mankind. In truth, of all the people of\r\nantiquity, the accursed and enslaved race of Ham were the most free-born,\r\nenlightened, and enterprising! Never was such a perversion of Scripture\r\ninterpretation to palliate and bolster up the systems of wickedness of\r\nthis and former days! Shall we compare the Model Republic and the\r\nmiserable and degraded nations of Brazils, Spain, and Portugal, the\r\npresent enslavers of the alleged posterity of Ham, with the once mighty\r\nEgyptians and Carthaginians?\r\n\r\n7th. But it may be said that Central Africa was peopled from Cush or\r\nEthiopia, and that this Cush, who peopled that portion of the Continent,\r\nwas the son of Ham. To this I have already replied, that the curse was\r\npronounced not on Cush, but on Canaan his brother, and it is arguing in a\r\ncircle to extend the subject. After all, we are not sure that Central\r\nAfrica, and the western coast, the theatre of the principal trade, was\r\npeopled from Ethiopia. Where is the proof? And besides, Central Africa,\r\nthe _bonâ fide_ Negroland, possesses states and powerful confederacies,\r\nwhom no power in Europe or America has yet been able to subjugate to\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n8th. The Africo-European slave-trade is only of extremely modern date. It\r\nis too late to look for the fulfilment of this prophecy amongst the\r\nEuropean transactions of the last three or four centuries, in this and\r\nany particular reference to Africa. But finally, up to a late period,\r\nslavery was co-extensive with the human race, in all times, ages, and\r\ncountries. All classes and races of men were made slaves alike, without\r\nany relation to Africa and Africans. The Greeks and Romans, if they made\r\nslaves of Africans, did not so enslave them because they were Africans,\r\nfor these ancient people made slaves of all, and even of their own\r\ncountrymen, it being a constituent element of their society.\r\n\r\nI have omitted purposely to question the Divine commission of the Yankee\r\nparsons to uphold slavery as the basis of their Republic. But it is\r\ndifficult not to question the right of an incensed father, awakening from\r\na drunken debauch, to condemn an innocent grandson (for what we know) to\r\neverlasting slavery and degradation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the word Δοῦλος, _Doulos_, used in the Greek\r\nTestament to denote either a slave or a servant, there can be no\r\ndoubt of the application of the term to both these relations of\r\nancient society. The word corresponds to ‮עבד‬ in the Hebrew, and\r\n‮عبد‬ in the Arabic, both being the same consonants, which terms are\r\nused, according to their application, to denote both slaves and\r\nservants. Slavery existed amongst the Jews as amongst the Greeks\r\nand Romans, in the beginning of the Christian era; so we have\r\nallusions to \"the bond and the free,\" as well as \"the Greeks and the\r\nBarbarians,\" the former phrase distinguishing slaves and free men,\r\nthe latter, nations of arts and science from those of uncivilized or\r\nsemi-civilized people. The question is not, then, the meaning of the\r\nterm _Doulos_, or its application to slavery at the period of the\r\npromulgation of the Christian religion; but, whether, because\r\nslavery was not then reprobated by the teachers of Christianity, it\r\nwas not therefore a very great evil. First of all, there are many\r\nthings of ancient society not reproved or reprobated by the founders\r\nof Christianity, which are inconvenient to, and inconsistent with,\r\nour moral sense, and which would violate the laws of modern society.\r\nSuch are the laws and customs of usury and polygamy. No man in his\r\nsenses would attempt to establish polygamy in modern society,\r\nbecause it is not prohibited and condemned by the writers of the New\r\nTestament. To argue, therefore, that slavery is congenial with the\r\nspirit of the Christian religion because it is not condemned by its\r\napostles and evangelists, is an utterly fallacious system of\r\nreasoning. But even supposing the apostles themselves practised\r\nslavery, and received into their communion slave-holders,\r\nmen-dealers and men-stealers, it does not therefore follow that we\r\nshould imitate them, and become men-stealers likewise. What, was\r\ngood or right for them and their state of society, may not be good\r\nor right for us and our society. The liberties of mankind require to\r\nbe guarded in these our days by the most intense hatred, and the\r\nbroadest and clearest denunciations of slavery, in every shape and\r\nmode of its developement. But let any people imbibe the spirit of\r\nChristianity, and slavery cannot exist amongst them; let all nations\r\nimbibe the spirit of Christianity, and slavery would become\r\nimmediately extinguished throughout the world.\r\n\r\n_20th._--A fine morning; the Desert around is fair and bright, save where\r\nthe Black Mountains are casting their mysterious shades. Visited by some\r\nSuccatou merchants, amongst whom were several Touaricks of Aheer. The\r\nHousa people and Aheer Touaricks both speak the Housa language, these\r\nTouaricks having abandoned their Berber dialect so far as I can learn. It\r\nis also difficult to distinguish the one people from the other when they\r\nwear the litham. One is nearly as dark as the other, but the features of\r\nthe Touaricks are much more, and often quite in the style of Europeans. A\r\nfew of the Aheer merchants are also, I have observed, tolerably fair. How\r\ndifferent are the airs and consequence of these merchants, and some of\r\nthem pure Housa Negroes, from the slaves which they lead into captivity;\r\nthey talk, and laugh, and feel themselves on a level with us, whilst\r\ntheir slaves are moody and silent, without confidence, and slink away\r\nfrom observation. Such is the impress of slavery on men in whose veins\r\nruns the same blood as our own. The Soudanese merchants gave me some\r\naccount of the reigning Sultans. Ali is the Sultan of Succatou, and\r\nsucceeded the famous Bello, to whom Clapperton was dispatched in his last\r\nmission. Daboo is the Sultan of Kanou, and Ghareema, Sultan of Kashna,\r\nbut both subjected to the Succatou Sultan. Besides these cities, the\r\ndistricts of Beetschee, Kaferda, Kasada, Sabongharee, Ghouber, Dell,\r\nYakoba and Noufee, besides other provinces, including a vast extent of\r\nterritory, are subjected to the Fullan dynasty of Succatou. But it is\r\nextremely difficult to get correct information from these Soudanese\r\nmerchants, though dealing and travelling through all the Housa and\r\nneighbouring countries; as to the names of the princes, they could not\r\nrecollect them. There are also frequent dethronements of the petty\r\nprinces.\r\n\r\n_21st._--I do not go out much now, except in the evening; I grow weary of\r\nthe place. A young Aheer Touarick called. I never refuse admittance to\r\nAheer merchants because they are so well behaved, and apparently not\r\nfanatical. He offered me a straight broad sword for five small dollars;\r\nit is quite new, having the handle made in the form of a cross and of\r\nhard wood, with a leathern scabbard. The blade was made in Europe. The\r\nTouarick dagger hilts are also made in the shape of a cross. There is\r\nbesides a Malta cross usually cut on the bullocks-hide shields. The cross\r\nappears to be an usual ornament of Soudan and Aheer arms. It has been\r\nthought there is in this device of arms some vestige of the now extinct\r\nChristianity of North Africa. The subject is curious, but we have no\r\nmeans to arrive at its solution. My Aheer friend pretended his sword was\r\nworth two slaves in Soudan; this is an exaggeration. Abdullah, the Souf\r\nArab, called. His brothers have brought thirty slaves from Soudan, which\r\nare destined for the market of Constantina. One of the Governor's sons\r\ngoes to Soudan with the return of the caravan, a lad not more than ten\r\nyears of age; he is to bring back merchandize as a regular trader. A\r\nlittle urchin of a Touarick, not more than nine years, came up to-day\r\nwith his mother and asked me, \"Why I did not know Mahomet?\" but without\r\nwaiting for a reply, set on cursing me. It is amazing how well these\r\nyoungsters have learnt this lesson, and how soon! for they never before\r\nsaw, or perhaps heard of, a Christian. The zealous mother had probably\r\nput up her son to this pious cursing of The Christian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_22nd._--Made the tour of the oasis, and sketched a view of the town,\r\nwhich is annexed. Weather extremely warm to-day--nay, hot, and in the\r\nmidst of January. What must it be in August! But the weather is far more\r\nchangeable and uncertain in Sahara than it is commonly thought to be.\r\nSeveral visits from the Touaricks of Aheer. Gave one a small lock and\r\nkey, which is esteemed a great curiosity in this country. It gladdened\r\nhis heart so much, that I believe he would now go through fire and water\r\nfor me. He wanted to take me to Soudan by main force. He went away, and\r\nreturned with some hard cheese made at Aheer, little squares somewhat\r\nsmaller than Dutch tiles, which he presented in acknowledgment. I have\r\nhad but few returns for the great variety of things I have given away in\r\nGhat. The Medina Shereef, Khanouhen's son-in-law, scolded me:--\"Ah,\r\nYâkob, you have done wrong to give away so much. You'll get nothing back.\r\nThis is a country of extortioners and extortion from strangers. You ought\r\nto have come here, said a few words, and left us.\" This is fine talk for\r\nthe Shereef. He knows as well as I know, that this wouldn't do. A courier\r\narrived from Ghadames, by which I received two kind letters from Malta.\r\nIt seems a thousand years since I received a letter from a friend.\r\n\r\nA Negress had the hardihood to call on me, begging, in the name of\r\nOuweek, thinking thereby to intimidate me. The bandit, however, sent a\r\nperson two or three days ago to beg of me a little tobacco. I should\r\ncertainly have sent some, had I had any left. Hateetah called, wondering\r\nwhat had become of me, as I had not called on him for a few days. Gave\r\nhim another dollar, but it is the last. The Consul says there is a great\r\ndeal of fever about amongst the merchants and people, but I don't see it.\r\nI was somewhat surprised, for I thought the town enjoyed good health. I\r\nhave reason to be thankful that it does not attack me. Apparently I'm\r\nfever proof. In all my life I never recollect to have caught an epidemic\r\nfever.\r\n\r\n_23rd._--Called upon the Governor. His Excellency displayed his\r\nhospitality by giving me zumeeta made with dates and sour milk. Took the\r\nopportunity of asking him about the origin of the Touaricks. He pretends\r\nthey are of Arab extraction. On inquiring how they lost their language,\r\nwhilst all the Arabian tribes retained theirs, his Excellency replied,\r\n\"They have learnt Touarghee as you have learnt Arabic.\" This is extremely\r\nunsatisfactory, for he could not explain from whom they learnt Touarghee.\r\nAbout the history of Ghat his Excellency knows nothing. He says only, \"It\r\nis a more ancient place than Ghadames,\" which, however, I do not believe.\r\nHis Excellency said the news had arrived from Algeria, that the Emperor\r\nof Morocco had united with Abdel Kader against the French, and four\r\ndistricts had elected the Emir for their chief. Called on Hateetah.\r\nWhilst there, an old lady of eighty years of age came in and got up to\r\ndance before me in the indecorous Barbary style, and then begged money.\r\nSeeing she had outlived her wits and took a great fancy for one of my\r\nbuttons, I cut it off and gave it her to the annoyance of Hateetah, the\r\nConsul scolding me for my condescension.\r\n\r\nThe Governor tells me there is a mountain of considerable altitude about\r\ntwo days from Ghat, in the route of Touat, from the base of which gush\r\nout some twelve large streams. The rain this year has fallen plentifully\r\non these heights, and wheat and barley have been sown on the banks of the\r\nstreams. This is fact of importance in Saharan geography, more especially\r\nas the mountain is situate in that central part of the Great Desert which\r\nis represented on the maps as an ocean of sand, the scene of eternal\r\ndesolation! . . . . . .\r\n\r\nEvening, whilst visiting Haj Ibrahim, who continues unusually kind to me,\r\ncame in our funny friend, the famous Aheer camel-driver, Kandarka. This\r\nKylouy is a great favourite with all, the Governor excepted. People\r\npraise his undaunted courage and say, \"If a troop of fifty robbers were\r\nto attack Kandarka alone, he would still resist them.\" He has shown\r\nhimself very friendly to me, and says, \"Write a letter to Aheer, my\r\nSultan, and I will take it. When you return bring me one thing--a sword,\r\nand I will take you safely over all Soudan.\" He has great influence with\r\nEn-Nour, Sultan of Aheer, and any one travelling under Kandarka's\r\nprotection is sure of a good reception from En-Nour.\r\n\r\n_24th._--A fine day, but hot. Our departure is now delayed till next\r\nmonth. What a dreadful loss of time is this! I'm weary to death. I wish I\r\nhad arranged to continue to Soudan. Grown disgusted with Ghat, I am\r\nreading what few books I have with me. Noticed more parallel customs\r\nbetween Africa and the East.\r\n\r\n\"And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the\r\ndays of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after\r\nthe death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which\r\nhis father had called them.\" (Gen. xxvi. 18.) The object of stopping up\r\nthe wells was to prevent the children of Abraham making use of them and\r\nso occupying the country. The same thing is done in Sahara. When an enemy\r\nis to be exterminated, or robbers repulsed from a particular district,\r\nthe wells are stopped up. Wells are also named by the digger of them. A\r\nman who goes to the expense of digging out a well, if peradventure he\r\nfinds water, has the privilege of giving to it his own name. There is one\r\non the route from Mourzuk to Tripoli called _Mukni_ or _Beer-Mukni_, from\r\nthe great merchant who dug the well. So the name of the city of Timbuctoo\r\nis said by some to be derived from the Berber Word _teen_, \"well\", and\r\n_Buktu_, the name of the person who on its present site dug a well for\r\nthe rendezvous or casual supply of passing caravans. But this derivation\r\nis merely conjectural.\r\n\r\n\"Take heed that thou _speak_ not to Jacob, good or bad.\" (Gen. xxi.\r\n24.) The verb _speak_ (‮תְּדַבֵּר‬) is used for the verb to\r\n_do_. The same idiom prevails amongst the Touaricks. The friendly\r\nTouaricks always address me, \"Don't be afraid, no person will _say_\r\n(or speak) either good or bad to you.\" So Jabour's slave brought me\r\nword from the Sheikh; \"No person is to say anything (_do_ anything)\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Wolff says, in his travels of Central Asia, the people of a strange\r\nplace always apply to his servant for information about himself. So the\r\nSaharans apply to my Negro servant for news or information about me.\r\n\r\n\"And David sat between the two gates . . . . . and the king said, If he\r\nbe _alone_ then is tidings in his mouth . . . . . . tidings.\" (2 Sam.\r\nxviii. 24, 25, 26.) All couriers in this country are sent _alone_. When\r\nthey travel through Sahara they have a camel to ride, but if there be\r\nabundant water on the road they go on foot. Merchants pay each so much to\r\nthe courier according to their means. A courier sent from this to\r\nTripoli, who also returns and brings answers to the letters, will receive\r\naltogether fifteen dollars. Touarghee couriers between this and Ghadames\r\ngo for half the sum.--\"And the watchman went up to the roof over the gate\r\nunto the wall and lifted up his eyes,\" &c. (part of the verses above\r\ncited). When a spy was sent from Ghadames to watch the Shânbah and their\r\napproaches round the country, on the eve of my departure from that\r\nplace, people went up a ruined tower, situated on a high ground, and\r\napparently built specially for the purpose, _to watch_ the return of the\r\nspy. I have seen several of these watch towers in the oases of Sahara.\r\n\r\n\"And they took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and\r\nlaid a very great heap of stones upon him.\" (2 Sam. xviii. 17.) When one\r\ndies in open desert, the people lay a heap of stones over the grave, the\r\nheap being smaller or larger according to the rank and consequence of the\r\nindividual. The mention of \"a very great heap,\" in the words cited,\r\nevidently denotes the royal rank of the deceased.\r\n\r\n_25th._--My young Targhee called today as usual. Asked him abruptly,\r\n\"What he did? What was his occupation? And how the Touaricks employed\r\nthemselves?\" With great simplicity, \"When the _nagah_ (she-camel) is with\r\nyoung and gives no milk, we come to Ghat, and eat dates and ghusub and\r\nbread, if we can get them. When the nagah gives milk we return and drink\r\nmilk and lie down on the road side. This is all which Touaricks do.\" The\r\nTouaricks are determined to feel as little of the primeval curse,--\"In\r\nthe sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,\"--as any people. The Targhee\r\nthen gave me spontaneously a bit of knowledge which I had not before\r\nheard. He proceeded, \"When I return to my house _on the road_ (or by the\r\ncaravan route), and to my wife, I don't uncover my face and go up to her\r\nand stare boldly at my wife. No, I cover my face all over, and sit down\r\ngently by her side, waiting till she speaks with all patience. When she\r\nspeaks, I speak, because I know then that she is willing to speak. It is\r\nvery indecent to go to your wife with your face uncovered.\" In fact,\r\ngenerally amongst the Touaricks, the men have their faces covered and the\r\nwomen their faces uncovered. The reverse of what we find in other\r\nMahometan countries. But also the reverse of what the native modesty of\r\nthe human mind dictates.\r\n\r\nAtkee, the Ghadamsee Arab, who was to have been my companion to Soudan,\r\nwent off, returning to Ghadames, without paying the money which I\r\ncommitted to his care for the owner of the camel's flesh, which we ate on\r\nthe route of Ghat. Atkee besides neglected to bring the money for the\r\nhalf of the skin of the sheep which I purchased with him, according to\r\npromise. These things are merest trifles, but merest trifles develop the\r\ncharacter of men. It is such actions of dishonesty which make one afraid\r\nof travelling in Africa, lest we are sacrificed to the designing villany\r\nof those who pretend most and exhibit the most officious marks of\r\nfriendship. In such a way poor Laing was entrapped and murdered. This\r\nvery Atkee, I considered the first man of the ghafalah. Zaleâ now tells\r\nme that Atkee wished to lay on two more dollars for the things given to\r\nOuweek. But the Arabs, like the Cretans of old, are \"all liars,\" and I\r\ndon't wish to make Atkee worse than he was. I am sufficiently\r\ndisappointed with him.\r\n\r\nThe Medina Shereef called, who is the most learned person in Ghat. I\r\nshowed him the Arabic Bible, which amazed and confounded him, as he\r\nturned over its well-printed pages. He sighed, nay, literally\r\ngroaned, at the profanity of having our infidel religion translated\r\ninto the holy Arabic language. The Shereef told me Arabic would be\r\nthe language of heaven. The Jews tell us it will be _Hebrew_, (or\r\n‮לשן הקדש‬). The Latin Church has its holy Latin, and a\r\n_trilingual_ bible of \"_Hebrew, Latin, Greek_,\" was said by pious\r\nfathers of that Church, to represent \"Christ crucified between two\r\nthieves.\" The Hindoos have their sacred Sanscrit, and so of the\r\nrest. The benumbed and frozen mind of the Esquimaux, amidst the fat\r\nseals, blubber, and seas of oil in which it revels and swims, when\r\nanticipating the joys of the polar heaven, makes the tongue\r\ninvoluntarily speak in genuine Esquimauxan gibberish. It is,\r\nhowever, not surprising that the language in which a people first\r\nreceives the rudiments of its religion should be greatly venerated\r\nand acquire a peculiar sacredness. The Shereef asked me to show him\r\nthe passage where Mahomet was spoken of under the title of\r\nParakleit; but he kept off religious discussion, having more\r\ndelicacy than his neighbours of Ghat. Ignorance is bliss to a\r\nShereef of these countries. Were the Shereef to see the wonders of\r\nChristian civilization, he would be stung to death with envy. A\r\ngentleman once told me as the result of his experience in Barbary,\r\nthat a Mussulman who had not seen Europe was more friendly to\r\nChristians than one who had, accounting for it on the principle of a\r\ndespicable envy.\r\n\r\n_26th._--The weather continues warm and fine; little wind. Objects at\r\nfifty miles' distance seem close upon you, so clear and rarefied is the\r\nair. Berka came this morning ostensibly for eye-powders, but really for a\r\nbit more sugar for his little grandson, the well-beloved son of his old\r\nage.\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Berka._--\"Sala-a-a-m!\"\r\n\r\n_The writer._--\"Good morning, Berka.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Berka._--\"Medicine for my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n_The writer._--\"Here is some powder, you must mix it with a bowl of\r\nwater; but take care, it's poisonous.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Berka._--\"Good God, Christian! take it back, my little son will\r\neat it for sugar. He gets everything and eats.\"\r\n\r\n_The writer._--\"Here's some sugar for him.\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Berka._--\"God Almighty bless you.\"\r\n\r\n_The writer._--\"How old are you, Berka?\"\r\n\r\n_Sheikh Berka._--\"My mother knows, but she's gone. She's gone to God!\"\r\n\r\nEssnousee came in for eye-powders to make a solution, and fever-powders\r\nto take with him to Soudan. Have only two or three of the latter which I\r\nkeep for myself. Gave him the last I had. He said, \"You don't see the\r\nfever, you don't visit enough, there's plenty of it in the houses.\"\r\nApparently it is common intermittent fever with some climatic variety; I\r\nthink Tertian ague.\r\n\r\nPeople are more civil in the streets to-day, and the rabble has lost its\r\ncuriosity or fancy for running after us. Negroes and slaves are still\r\nimpudent, not recognizing in the Kafer their secret friend. Saw Khanouhen\r\nin the Esh-Shelly, who called after me to come to him. Hateetah was with\r\nhim. The Prince began his satires on the Consul:--\"Yâkob, who is the best\r\nman, I or Hateetah? Have you written[92] this fellow Hateetah? All about\r\nhim? Is this the English Consul? Does your Sultan own him?\" Khanouhen\r\npressed him so hard, that I ran off to save Hateetah's feelings, all the\r\npeople roaring with laughter, and calling me back.\r\n\r\nAfternoon saw the Governor. His Excellency lavished his hospitality on\r\nme. He gave me coffee, dried Soudan beef cut up into shreds, and some of\r\nthe Soudan almonds. These almonds are not fine flavoured like those of\r\nthe north, but are viscid, rancid, and bitter. Nor are they of the same\r\nbeautiful filbert-form, but of clumsy oval and double-oval shapes. The\r\nshell is soft, and can be broken easily with the fingers. The kernel is\r\nmostly double, and when slightly rubbed splits into halves or rather two\r\nkernels. The dried beef is very pleasant eating, but rather too dry, the\r\nfat and moisture being all consumed. We have heard of beef cooked in the\r\nsun on the bastions of Malta, but this is really beef cooked in the sun.\r\nIt is an excellent provision for long journeys over The Desert. People\r\nchew it as tobacco is chewed. Our Governor-Marabout got very familiar\r\nthis morning, and talked about his family. He called a little boy and\r\nsaid to me, \"Look at my little son, he's as white as you are white.\" The\r\nchild was indeed very fair for a young Saharan. He asked me as tabeeb, if\r\nChristian women had more children than one, and if they went longer than\r\na year, which he had heard. He pretended his was a small family, and he\r\nshould like to have fifty children, which, he added, \"all Sultans ought\r\nto have;\" but, for money he did not care, he wished all his children were\r\npoor but pious marabouts. His preaching is quite contrary to his\r\npractice. A more money-getting ambitious fellow I have not found in The\r\nDesert. The report which I heard of the Governor of Ghat being changed\r\nwhilst at Ghadames, was a sham abdication on his part. From domestic\r\nmatters he proceeded to talk of politics. His Excellency is always\r\nanxious to give an immense idea of the fighting qualities and numbers of\r\nthe Touaricks. He wishes me to make a favourable report of them, and his\r\nposition at Ghat, and country. He declares the warriors to muster 15,000\r\nstrong, which would give too numerous a population for the Azgher section\r\nof Touaricks. The Haghar, and especially the Kylouy Touaricks, have an\r\ninfinitely larger population than those of Ghat. The Marabout pretends\r\nthere are some Touaricks who never saw corn or tasted bread, and others\r\nwho dress only in skins. Indeed, I saw a Touarghee from the country, as\r\nwell as The Touarick Prophet, dressed entirely in skins and tanned\r\nleather.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency then introduced his favourite subject of the battles\r\nbetween Moslems and Nazarenes for the possession of Constantinople, in\r\nwhich his ancestors so valiantly fought. He said, the sword of one of his\r\ngrandfathers was laid up in the armoury of Stamboul, and submitted to me\r\nif I thought the Turks would give it to him if he were to make the\r\ndemand. I told him to apply to the British Ambassador at the Porte,\r\nmaking the thing of the consequence suited to the Marabout's taste. \"No,\"\r\nhe replied, \"I shall go myself one day and fetch it.\" His Excellency then\r\nbegan to extol the military forces and powers of the princes of\r\nAfrica:--\"The Sultan of Timbuctoo has 100,000 fighting men! Wadai has\r\n100,000 warriors! The Sultans of Soudan have innumerable hosts, as the\r\nsand-grains of The Desert are innumerable!\" He then asked silly questions\r\nas to whether the Turks could beat the Christians in fighting. I told him\r\nplainly, the Turks now learnt the art of war from the Christians, and the\r\nlatter were not only superior to them, but to all Mohammedans whatever,\r\nArabs or Touaricks, Kabyles, or what not, recommending his Excellency not\r\nto credit the absurd reports propagated by foolish dervishes of The\r\nDesert, as to how the Emperor of Morocco was conquering all the French\r\nand other Christians. Indeed, I'm obliged to be school-master, and\r\ngeographer, and admonisher, to Sheikhs, marabouts, merchants, to all and\r\nevery body. The subject of religion was now introduced, and I found the\r\nGovernor, though a Marabout, of the first water, did not know that the\r\nChristians read and studied the sacred books of the Jews. I told his\r\nExcellency, Christian Marabouts must read and study the sacred books of\r\nall religions, and Christian talebs frequently read the Koran to acquire\r\na knowledge of classic Arabic. This information greatly amazed the\r\nGovernor. I cannot, however, report more of his conversation, which would\r\nbe endless. I sent him on my return the Arabic Bible, which the Shereef\r\nhad told him I had with me.\r\n\r\nSpent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. The Haj surprised me by saying, \"All\r\nmy slaves, even the youngest of not more than four or five years' old,\r\nmust walk to Tripoli as they have walked from Kanou to Ghat.\" I found\r\nKandarka with him. The camel-driver is a right-jolly fellow, quite a new\r\nspecies of being from the Touaricks of Ghat. A great deal of merry\r\nlaughing and grinning Negro feeling is in his composition. But, with all\r\nhis fun, he is a most determined man. He is about to convey some of the\r\nHaj's merchandize to Kanou, as being the bravest and most trust-worthy of\r\nall the Aheer camel-drivers.\r\n\r\n_27th._--I'm out of my reckonings with the Moors by some mistake or\r\nother, of them or me, for I'm Monday, and they're Tuesday. Their month\r\nand our month, like our respective religions, is also in continual\r\ncollision, their month being lunar, not solar. The weather is very warm.\r\nAm exceedingly tired of remaining in Ghat; always regretting I did not\r\ndetermine to go to Soudan. Merchants are daily leaving in small caravans,\r\nnot large caravans, which is a proof of the security of the routes, and\r\nthe word of the Touarghee Sheikh is \"one\" word; \"The routes are all in\r\npeace,\" they say. Walked out with a very large stick, which frightened\r\nthe Ghatee boys, who all thought it was for them, on account of their\r\nformer sauciness. Was surprised at the Medina Shereef asking me to lend\r\n(give) him fifteen dollars to go to Tripoli. I promised very foolishly to\r\ngive him his provisions to Tripoli, in the event of his proceeding with\r\nour caravan. What people for begging are these! The Shereef had just been\r\nscolding me for giving so much to these importunates. Although their\r\nhouses are full of stores and money, they will still beg, and beg, and\r\nbeg . . . . beg . . . beg. . . But this evening, at Haj Ibrahim's, we had\r\na transcendant specimen of begging. The beggar was no less a personage\r\nthan The Giant. I may remind the reader, The Giant is the son of Berka's\r\nsister, and is head of the tribe at Berka's death. The Giant therefore\r\ncame to demand backsheesh, as being the lineal successor of Berka, who\r\nwas Haj Ibrahim's protector. Haj Ibrahim observed:--\"I have given Berka\r\ntwenty dollars, and some other presents, and I cannot give any thing to\r\nhis oulad ('sons.')\" The Giant would hear none of this, insisted upon a\r\npresent for himself, and swore by all the sacred names of the Deity,\r\nfrequently using his favourite oath, \"Allah Akbar!\" After an hour's\r\ndebating, it was agreed that, for the future, Berka, if he lived till\r\nanother year, (for the aged chieftain is \"tottering o'er the grave,\")\r\nshould have a smaller present, and the portion subtracted should be given\r\nto The Giant. But this is cutting the blanket at one end, to sew the\r\npiece on the other, for the sons and nephews of Berka now share the\r\npresents amongst them. His Giantship was very condescending to me, though\r\nsavage enough with the merchant. He laughed and joked, and \"grinned a\r\nghastly smile,\" and asked me, why I did not go into the public square and\r\nsee all the people, thinking my not going out more showed a want of\r\nconfidence in the Touaricks. Want of confidence in a Touarick is the most\r\nserious insult you can offer to him. So Dr. Oudney properly records of\r\nHateetah, and says, \"he was indignant at the feelings which the people of\r\nMourzuk had against the Touaricks--the Touaricks who pride themselves in\r\nhaving one word, and performing what they promise.\" But Hateetah has\r\nsince become an old man, and, with the usual prudence of age, recommends\r\nme not to go much about amongst the people. \"Something unpleasant might\r\nhappen,\" he says, \"for which all the Sheikhs would be sorry.\" The Giant\r\nsaid to me, \"Come, you Christian, I shall sell you a wife of the Shânbah\r\nwomen. Stop here till I come back.\"\r\n\r\nA most affecting incident was related to me by Mustapha. Two of his\r\nslaves quarrelled, and last night, whilst one was fast asleep, the other\r\nwent stealthily and fetched a shovelful of burning wood ashes, and poured\r\nthem over the sleeping slave's face, tongue, and neck! He is suffering\r\nsadly, and Mustapha has called for medicine. So act these poor\r\ncreatures, the victims of a common misfortune. How cruel is man to his\r\nbrother! In all situations, man is his own enemy! This incident reminds\r\nme of what Colonel Keatinge relates of the unfortunate Jews in Morocco.\r\nAlthough the Jews are very badly treated in that empire, and all suffer\r\ngreat indignities, yet, to increase their own misfortunes, and by their\r\nown hands, one Jew has actually been known to purchase from the Sultan\r\nthe right, the privilege of torturing another Jew. The speculation, adds\r\nthe Colonel, was considered \"a good one,\" because, if no pecuniary\r\nadvantage followed, the pleasure of inflicting the torture was certain.\r\nThe privilege of bidding for himself, or buying himself from the torture,\r\nwas the only one allowed the victim on such horrible occasions! Some\r\npeople have pretended that there is a limit to human degradation; but\r\nthere is always a lower depth--and a still lower depth. Not death itself\r\nlimits this sort of degradation--the tomb of the unfortunate Morocco Jew\r\nis defiled--and his name and faith furnishes, unendingly, the \"by-words\"\r\nof the curse of the Moor! On the late massacre of the Jews at Mogador,\r\nneither the Earl of Aberdeen nor Monsieur Guizot, condescended to\r\nremonstrate to the Moorish Emperor; nor did their co-religionists of\r\nFrance and England attempt (that I have heard of) to excite their\r\nGovernments on behalf of the plundered and houseless Maroquine Jews . . .\r\nHow long are these things to last? . . . Till doomsday? . . . But did not\r\nJupiter give Pandora the box with hope at the bottom? . . . To be\r\nserious, would not a million or two of the Rothschilds be well spent in\r\nbuying the freedom of the Morocco Jews? Could a patriotic Jew do any\r\nthing which, in the last moment of his life, would produce more and such\r\nsatisfactory reflections? It is to be hoped that the patriotic Jews of\r\nEurope are not like some foolish Christians who wish to continue the\r\noppression of the Jews in order to fulfil the prophecies, as if God could\r\nnot take care of his own veracity! But these sottish Christians had\r\nbetter mind what they are about, in contributing to the continued\r\noppression of the Jews, and preventing their emancipation, because,\r\nwhatever may be the duration of the prophetic curse upon the Jews, God\r\nwill not, cannot hold the contributors to their oppression guiltless, no\r\nmore than he did the Babylonian princes who first carried away the Jews\r\ninto captivity.\r\n\r\n_28th._--Distributed to the Soudanese merchants solution for the eyes.\r\nThis evening Haj Ibrahim's slaves sung and played together in the\r\ncourt-yard. They consist of girls and boys, and young women. They sung in\r\nchoruses, one first repeating a line or a verse in the style of the\r\nancient Greeks. Their voices are not very melodious, and they remind me\r\nof the responses of a charity school at church. Still it is grateful to\r\none's feelings to witness how pitying is God to these poor things, in\r\ngiving them such happy hearts in the early days of their bondage!\r\nKandarka was here, the same merry-hearted fellow as before. Providence\r\nhas compensated Africa for the wrongs inflicted by her enemies, in giving\r\nher children a happy and contented disposition.\r\n\r\n_29th._--A fine morning; weather warm, cold seems to have left us\r\naltogether. I have discussed the \"vexed question,\" with the Soudanese and\r\nSaharan merchants, as to how the ostrich is hunted and caught. In Soudan\r\nthe ostrich is snared by small cords, the bird getting its legs into the\r\nnooses. The trap is a quantity of herbage laid over the cordage. Here the\r\nNegro waits for his rich feathery booty, and draws the cordage as soon as\r\ntheir feet are in the noose. Others throw stones, sticks, and lances, at\r\nthe ostrich; others shoot them. But in Sahara, and in what is called the\r\nedge of The Desert, the ostrich is simply ridden down by the mounted Arab\r\nduring the great heats of summer. The ostrich, though a tenant of the\r\nburning Sahara, cannot run well for any length of time during the summer,\r\nand so becomes the prey of the Arab, whose horse bears heat better. In\r\nand about Wadnoun, ostriches are hunted with what is called the Desert\r\nhorse, which is a horse living chiefly on milk, and which has a power of\r\nendurance the most extraordinary. This agrees with Porret, who says, \"the\r\nostriches can only be taken by tiring them down.\" But he does not mention\r\nthe summer. Riley says the ostrich is driven before the wind, and Jackson\r\nagainst the wind, in being hunted. Captain Lyon says, \"it is during the\r\nbreeding season the greatest number of ostriches are caught, the Arabs\r\nshooting the old ones on their nests.\" The Sahara is a world of itself,\r\npeopled with a variety of hunters, who will each hunt in the manner he\r\nlikes best. I may add, as I have often alluded to Biblical matters, the\r\nstory of the ostrich forsaking her eggs, and leaving them to be hatched\r\nin the sun, is not correct. Merchants often questioned me as to what we\r\ndid with ostrich feathers, people making no particular use of them in\r\nSahara. When I told them our ladies adorned their heads with ostrich\r\nfeathers, they laughed heartily, adding, \"How ridiculous!\" We laugh at\r\ntheir sable beauties adorning their necks and bosoms with trumpery\r\nglass-beads, and they laugh at our red and white beauties adorning their\r\nheads with ostrich feathers. The Chinese have their peacock's feather as\r\na set-off against our button-hole ribbon; \"Ainsi va le monde.\" One of the\r\nAheer Touaricks, who, unlike my Ghat friends, return presents, brought me\r\nto-day a damaged ostrich skin and feathers. Being quite out of pens, and\r\nnot able to persuade the Tripolines to send me up a few quills, I cut out\r\nseveral ostrich quills, and had the pleasure, for the first time in my\r\nlife, of writing with an ostrich pen. I cut several, and amused and\r\nsatirized myself by writing in my journal with one quill, \"James\r\nRichardson has much to learn;\" with another quill, \"Richardson, James,\r\nmust take care of his health,\" &c., \"Yâkob Richardson was an egregious\r\nass to come into The Desert,\" &c., &c. These quills are very firm, if not\r\nfine and flexible, and it is a good substitute in The Desert for \"the\r\ngrey goose quill.\" I was so delighted with this unexpected supply of\r\npens, that I offered the Touarghee of Aheer another present, but he\r\nresolutely refused it, adding, \"I wish to show you that a Touarick of\r\nAheer can be grateful, and do a kindness to a stranger, without eating\r\nhim up.\" This was a tall man, of fair complexion, but pitted with the\r\nsmall-pox, of middle age, and called Mohammed. He was one of the best\r\nspecimens of Aheer Touaricks, and always said to me, \"Come to our\r\ncountry. You will walk about the streets without being molested by any\r\none. We never saw a Christian in our country, and we wish to see one.\"\r\n\r\nEvening, a ghafalah from Aheer has arrived, bringing sixty camel-loads of\r\nsenna, and ten of elephants' teeth. A courier is also come from Touat,\r\nwith the intelligence that the Shânbah, instead of fleeing away from the\r\nthreatened attack of the Touaricks, had boldly appeared on the Touarick\r\nterritory, in the route of Touat and Ghadames, having a force of 1200\r\nmounted men. The Touaricks are at last alarmed, and dispatching\r\nmessengers through all their districts, to give intelligence of the\r\narrival of the enemy. I'm afraid the Touaricks have been making too sure\r\nof their approaching success. A messenger has been sent after the last\r\nGhadamsee ghafalah which left here. Great excitement prevails in the\r\ntown, and Jabour and Khanouhen are preparing to leave for their\r\ndistricts, where the levies of troops are collecting. A portion of the\r\nTripoline ghafalah is stopped a few hours from this, on account of three\r\nof the camels running away during the night. The camel is by no means so\r\nstupid as it looks, and knows exactly when it is about to commence a long\r\njourney over The Desert. The three camels could not withstand the\r\ntemptation of the herbage in the wady, and started off, and will not be\r\nfound for days. Fulness of food as well as hunger makes animals savage.\r\nOne of our camels whilst grazing bit a slave, and has nearly killed him.\r\nThis, however, rarely happens; the camel is generally docile, if not\r\nharmless.\r\n\r\nThe Touaricks belonging to Berka have just paid Christians a very high\r\ncompliment, but at my expense. I promised some more sugar to Berka if I\r\ncould get any from Haj Ibrahim. The Sheikh sent twice for the sugar, and\r\nyesterday, when some of his people visited the merchant, they said to\r\nhim, \"Where is the sugar of The Christian? It is not right for Yâkob to\r\ntreat us thus. Christians never lie.\" A Christian tourist must never\r\nfollow the example of a Mahometan in this country, that is, of always\r\npromising and never refusing, because it is disagreeable to refuse. In\r\nthe above case, however, my promise was quite conditional, on Haj\r\nIbrahim's having sugar. Nevertheless, there is happily an opinion\r\nprevalent in North Africa, that Christians, and especially English\r\nChristians, have but \"one word.\" Let all of us British tourists try to\r\nkeep up this high character.\r\n\r\n_30th._--A little colder this morning, and foggy. The senna ghafalah\r\nwill detain us three days more. Our camels are come up from the\r\ngrazing districts; my nagah looks much better. Jabour called this\r\nmorning to bid me farewell, before departing to his country house.\r\nThe Sheikh leaves this evening. Ashamed of the small present I made\r\nhim on my arrival, I apologized, and begged him to accept of the\r\nonly razor I had, which being quite new, and very large and\r\nfine-looking, exceedingly pleased the Sheikh. We had together a good\r\ndeal of the most friendly conversation. Jabour promises, on my\r\nreturn, to conduct me _en route_ for Timbuctoo, and confide me to\r\nthe care of some of his trustworthy followers. He will conduct me by\r\nthe south-western route, which is stated to be forty-five days'\r\njourney on M. Carette's map. But the Sheikh tells me it is only\r\nthirty days, or less. This route is intersected by many mountains,\r\nthe height of which is so great, that the valleys are, for Sahara,\r\nperceptibly cold. These heights attract the clouds and condense them\r\ninto rain, and the rocky region is full of beautiful springs and\r\nfoaming cascades, of eternal freshness. There is, however, the\r\ndreaded plain of _Tenezrouft_ (‮تنزروفت‬) to be traversed, eight\r\ndays without water for man, or herbage for camels. This is the\r\ngrand difficulty in getting to Timbuctoo from the north. The Sheikh\r\nwent so far as to insure my safety to Timbuctoo and back. He then\r\nobserved, \"All the people from Tripoli are under my protection, all\r\nChristians who come that way. Tell your countrymen they have nothing\r\nto fear in that route; tell them to come in peace.\" He continued,\r\n\"Why, I observe you writing Arabic, why don't you believe in our\r\nbooks?\" I answered, \"We have our prophet, who is Jesus; but all\r\nChristians believe that 'God is one,' that 'God is the most\r\nmerciful,' (‮ربّ واحد‬--‮الله الرحمان الرحيم‬)\" citing this Arabic.\r\nHe then shook hands most cordially with me, and we parted (for\r\never?). I always looked upon this good and just man as the _bonâ\r\nfide_ friend, not only of me and Christians, but of all strangers,\r\nvisiting Ghat, whatsoever. A little while after he sent me, by one\r\nof his people, a small present of a Touarghee travelling bag, made\r\nof coarse-dressed leather. This is my first present from a Touarghee\r\nSheikh, and I shall keep it as long as I can.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Jabour left, Hateetah came in, but in a very different mood.\r\nSomebody had told him I had given the razor to Jabour, and he was also\r\nannoyed at seeing the present from Jabour, of whom he is, as of all the\r\nother Sheikhs, very jealous. Hateetah now vented his rage against Haj\r\nIbrahim, for only giving him a turban-band. He swore solemnly he would\r\ncut the merchant's throat on the road if he did not give him five or ten\r\ndollars. I laughed at this petulant sally, and said, \"Yes, cut his\r\nthroat; you will do better than Ouweek.\" This was too much for Hateetah,\r\nwho was trying, but apparently unable, to work himself up into a\r\npassion, and he couldn't help breaking down; so taking me by the hand, he\r\nsaid, \"Do you believe me?\" He was in hopes I would go and report this\r\nmock-furious speech to Haj Ibrahim, but I was determined I would not\r\ninterfere. He then abused the route of Fezzan, and said it was full of\r\nbanditti. Of this also I took no notice.\r\n\r\nOne of my most curious acquaintances is an old Touatee, established in\r\nGhat as a trader many years. He comes frequently to barter with me,\r\nbringing bits of cheese and dried meat. He will never let go his wares\r\nuntil he gets the equivalent fast in his hands. But he has no prejudice\r\nagainst Christians. He often recommends to me the sable beauties of Ghat,\r\nbut I always reply, \"This is prohibited to Christians.\" He is very much\r\npuzzled to know what I write about, and says, \"Don't write anything\r\nagainst me.\"\r\n\r\nSpent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. The senna, which was formerly only\r\nfour and a half dollars the cantar, is now six, at which price the\r\nmerchant bought twenty camel-loads to-day. Kandarka came in, and this\r\nfunny fellow, on seeing me, immediately cried out, \"Saif zain,\" \"wahad,\"\r\nwhich, being interpreted literally, means, \"A fine sword!\" \"one!\" but\r\nwith a more enlarged interpretation and paraphrase, means, \"Bring me a\r\nfine sword when you come back, a sword which will kill a man with one\r\nstroke.\" After repeating this twenty times and suiting the action to the\r\nword, the Aheer camel-driver set to and caricatured the Touaricks of Ghat\r\nin general, and the Sultan Shafou in particular. His topic was the\r\nShânbah war, the everlasting theme now in Ghat. The camel-driver mimicked\r\nand satirized the aged Sultan by taking up a walking-stick and walking\r\nin a stooping posture, leaning on the staff, begging from door to door,\r\nknocking at the door of the room in which we were sitting, slipping down\r\nthe wrapper from his mouth, which the Touaricks do when they attempt to\r\nspeak in earnest, and was to show the importunity of the begging Sultan.\r\nThis drama was performed to denote the general poverty of the Ghat\r\nTouaricks, as compared with the rich Touaricks of Aheer. The Aheer\r\ncomedian then caricatured all the Touaricks together, by shaking his\r\nhands and body as if a tremor was passing through his limbs; he then fell\r\nat full length on the floor, as if dead. In this way the comic\r\ncamel-driver ridiculed the poverty and pusillanimity of Ghat Touaricks.\r\nHe convulsed all the Moors and Arabs with laughter. In fact, he hit off\r\nthe objects of his satire as well as some of our best comedians. And from\r\nwhat I can learn in town, it would appear the pride of Khanouhen is\r\nhumbled before the threatening aspect of the war. Made Kandarka a present\r\nof a razor which I purchased of Haj Ibrahim. He took it up and exclaimed,\r\n\"Saif zain, wahad, I'll unman all the Touaricks with this. Who's\r\nKhanouhen? (raising himself up in a boasting position.) Who's\r\nJabour?--only a Marabout. Who's Hateetah?--a whimpering slave-girl! What\r\nis Berka?--soon to be coffined? Shafou! Come, I'll give thee, poor\r\nSultan, a little bit of bread. As to that tall fellow (the Giant),\r\nthere's no camel big enough to carry him. He'll fall down on the road and\r\nrot like a dog.\" This is amply sufficient to show that satire is not an\r\nEuropean monopoly, but grows indigenous to The Desert. I asked the\r\nGovernor what he should do if the Shânbah should come up against Ghat,\r\nrecommending him to secure his doors well and prepare for defence. He\r\nreplied, \"I'm a Marabout.\" But this character would not screen him from\r\nthe shot of the Shânbah matchlocks. Of course, there's not a bit of\r\nordnance in The Sahara. I don't recollect seeing a single piece of cannon\r\nat the Turkish fortified places of Mourzuk, or Sockna, or Bonjem.\r\n\r\n_31st._--Took a walk to see the Governor. He was very civil, and I\r\nbegin to think more of his talent. His Excellency was very busy in\r\nweighing gold. He divided it into halves, into thirds, into\r\nquarters, and weighed it all ways, and separately, with much skill.\r\nThis gold was brought yesterday from Touat by some Touateen,\r\noriginally brought from Timbuctoo, there being no gold or precious\r\nmetals in this part of Sahara. People pretend, however, there is\r\ncoal in the route between Ghat and Touat. But were it found there\r\never so plentifully, it would not pay the carriage to the coast. The\r\nMarabout merchant next unpacked two camels, laden with heiks or\r\nbarracans, with presents of tobacco and shoes (Morocco), for himself\r\nand his family. These were sent from his relatives in Ain Salah. On\r\none of the packages was written in Arabic, \"To our brother, the\r\nMarabout, God bless him.\" In this unpacking, all his family were\r\nemployed for a couple of hours as busy as bees. The Governor\r\nafterwards gave us coffee, and asked me to examine the head of one\r\nof his children. He had heard from the merchants of Ghadames how I\r\nhad examined the heads of the servants of Rais Mustapha. This child\r\ncould not walk, having no strength in his limbs. The brain was\r\npushed backwards and forwards, very flat on the sides, and sharp at\r\nthe top of the head, leaving a very miserable portion in the\r\ncentral regions. The entire nervous system was evidently deranged.\r\nThe Governor had no difficulty in crediting my power of divination\r\nthrough phrenology, believing, like other Moors, that we Christians\r\nhave familiar conversation with the Devil, by which we acquire our\r\nsuperiority of knowledge over them, the Faithful. His Excellency, on\r\ntaking leave, gave me some Touat dates, which are hard but extremely\r\nsweet. This species is called _Tenakor_. The dates of Warklah and\r\nSouf are also very sweet. One of the Touatee asked me, if I would go\r\nto Timbuctoo. I replied, \"I'm afraid.\" \"You are right,\" he said,\r\n\"for there's no Sultan there, everybody does as he likes, all men\r\nare equal.\" Certainly a powerful Sultan would be of advantage in The\r\nSahara, for a traveller would then have but one master to\r\nconciliate, now he has ten thousand masters to propitiate. People in\r\nquarrelling say, \"You must not do this (or that), for you are in a\r\n_Blad Sheikh_\" (a country where there is a constituted authority).\r\nLiberty is a good thing, nothing is better; but there must be with\r\nit morality. Without morality, liberty is only liberty to do\r\nmischief. On my return home, Hateetah called. The first word he\r\nuttered was, \"I'm at war with Haj Ibrahim.\" \"Ah,\" I replied, \"you\r\nmust cut his throat, he's a great rascal.\" Hateetah dropped his\r\ncomplaint at once, and observed, \"Patience; all the Touaricks leave\r\nhere to-morrow to go against the Shânbah, I only shall remain to go\r\nwith you.\" He informed me the place of rendezvous is Dēdā, or Dēdē,\r\nthree or four days westward from Ghat. Shafou and Khanouhen are\r\nthere, and an immense congregation of all the tribes is sitting in\r\ncouncil and debate. Shafou has sent a message to allow Hateetah to\r\ngo with me to Fezzan. All the mahrys are in urgent request for the\r\nwar, and Khanouhen has prohibited the Touaricks from engaging their\r\ncamels for the carriage of merchandize. After all it appears there\r\nis a strong government in The Desert. One of the questions debated\r\nis, \"Whether they shall attack the Haghar tribes, subjected to the\r\nSultan Bassa, if they (the Haghar) give an asylum to the Shânbah.\"\r\nThe Touat people wish the Azgher and Haghar tribes to unite for the\r\nextermination of the robbers, who injure the commerce of all this\r\npart of Sahara. In the evening saw Haj Ibrahim. Kandarka came in:\r\n\"Saif zain, wahad,\" he bawled out as usual. He entered into a minute\r\ndescription of the kind of sword he wished, one that would bend and\r\nwas as elastic as a cane.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] When you make a drawing, they say \"Write\" a drawing, or\r\n    \"Write\" a man, instead of draw a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE TO FEZZAN.\r\n\r\n     Account of Timbuctoo.--Streets of Ghat deserted by departure of\r\n     Caravans.--Packing of Senna.--Return of the Soudan Caravan.--The\r\n     Giant and his Gang sally out in search of a Supper.--System of\r\n     Irrigation.--The Saharan Hades.--Continued departure of People to\r\n     Soudan.--Hateetah serves himself from Haj Ibrahim's Goods.--Scold\r\n     Ghadamsee Merchants for introducing Religious Discussion.--Mode\r\n     of Fashionable Dressing of the Hair, and Female\r\n     Adornment.--Saharan Beauties.--Costume of Touaricks.--Gardens of\r\n     the Governor.--Attempt a Journey to Wareerat Range.--Hateetah and\r\n     Haj Ibrahim become reconciled.--Departure of Kandarka for\r\n     Aheer.--Day of my departure from Ghat.--Moral and Social\r\n     Condition of the Saharan People compared to European\r\n     Society.--Force of our Slave Caravan.--First Night's Bivouack.\r\n\r\n\r\nI HAVE not obtained any additional information at Ghat respecting the\r\nstill mysterious city of Timbuctoo. In comparing Caillié's description\r\nwith that given by the American sailor, Robert Adams, I find Caillié's\r\ninformation agrees the better with what I have collected myself from the\r\nmouths of those who have been long resident at Timbuctoo. Indeed, Adams's\r\ndescription apparently refers to some Negro city in Bambara or\r\nthereabouts, between Jinnee and Timbuctoo. But I shall not attempt to\r\nimpugn the veracity of the one or the other. Caillié says, \"The little\r\ninformation which I have obtained of Timbuctoo was furnished me by my\r\nhost Sidi Abdullah-Chebir, and the Kissour Negroes.\" In another place he\r\nsays that he wished to return _viâ_ Morocco, and not by the Senegal, for\r\nfear he should not be believed, his countrymen being envious of his\r\nsuccess. Both of these statements deserve consideration in determining\r\nthe authenticity of his voyage.\r\n\r\nA great variety of spelling exists in the writing of the name of\r\nTimbuctoo. M. Jomard, Member of the French Institute, gives\r\n‮تِيم٘بُك٘تُ‬ but says he does not think that this word when\r\nproperly written contains the ‮ي‬. He thinks, however, we may be\r\nsatisfied with the orthography of ‮تِم٘بُك٘تُ‬. And he\r\nadds, \"I know that Batouta writes Te_n_boctou, _n_ being used for _m_.\" I\r\nhave found two ways of spelling Timbuctoo in The Desert, viz.,\r\n‮تِن٘بُك٘تُوا‬, and ‮تِن٘بُك٘تُا‬, and they both agree with Batouta.\r\nWe may, therefore, consider Batouta's style of spelling the more\r\ncorrect orthography. Now, ‮تين‬, _Teen_, in Touarghee, is \"well\" or\r\n\"pit.\" The term occurs in combination with many names of stations in\r\nTarghee Sahara, as will be seen in the map; for example,\r\n_Teenyeghen_, a well of water, seven days' journey on the route from\r\nGhadames to Ghat; and _Nijberteen_, a well in my route from Ghadames\r\nto Ghat, already mentioned. In the first instance _Teen_ occurs at\r\nthe beginning of the word, and the second at the end; but, in both\r\ncases, the meaning is \"the well of Nijber,\" and \"the well of\r\nYeghen.\" _Teenbuktu_ follows the same rule of Berber or Touarghee\r\ncombination, and means \"the Well of Buktu,\" probably Buktu being the\r\ndigger of the pits of Timbuctoo.\r\n\r\nWith regard to information collected by myself of this city, I can only\r\nadd a few particulars. Timbuctoo is situated upon the northern flats of\r\nthe Niger, or at about half a day's distance from it during the summer,\r\nand three hours only in winter, the difference arising from the increase\r\nof the water of the river during the latter season. But our merchants do\r\nnot mention whether this river be a branch of the Niger (which they call\r\nNeel or Nile), or the Niger itself. This they are evidently unacquainted\r\nwith. They never mention the port of Cabra, which is so distinctly\r\nnoticed by Caillié. The climate is hot, and always hot, but extremely\r\nhealthy--as healthy as any part of Central Africa. The city is about four\r\ntimes larger than Tripoli as to area, but in proportion not so densely\r\ninhabited, the population being about 23,000 souls. It has no walls now;\r\nthough it formerly had, and is open to the inroads of the tribes of The\r\nDesert. The population is very mixed, and consists of Fullans, who are\r\nthe dominant caste, Touaricks, Negroes, and Moors and Arabs from\r\ndifferent oases of Sahara, as also from the Northern Coast of Africa. The\r\nmajority of the Moors are Maroquines. The Government is absolute, and now\r\nin the delegated possession of a Marabout named Mokhtar, and the national\r\nreligion Mahometan. There do not appear to be any Pagans or idolatrous\r\nAfricans now resident in Timbuctoo, but some half century ago most of the\r\nKissour Negroes, the native Negroes of Timbuctoo, were Pagans. The\r\npresent Sultan is called Ahmed Ben Ahmed Lebbu Fullan, whose authority is\r\nestablished over the two great cities of Jinnee and Timbuctoo, and all\r\nthe intervening and neighbouring districts, including several cities of\r\ninferior note. He is the son of the famous warrior Ahmed Lebbu, who\r\ndethroned the native princes of the Ramee, or those who \"bend the bow.\"\r\nThe usual residence of the Sultan is now at Jinnee. The city is a place\r\nof great sanctity, and no person has the privilege of smoking in it--that\r\nis to say, defiling it, but the Touaricks, who are there so overbearing\r\nand unmanageable, as to be above the local laws. They are the cause of\r\ncontinual disturbances at Timbuctoo; nevertheless, so powerful are the\r\nFullans, that they manage to keep the Touaricks in subjection, as well as\r\nthe native Negro tribes. There are seven mosques, the minarets of some of\r\nwhich are as large as those of Tripoli.\r\n\r\nThere are several schools and a few learned doctors amongst the priests.\r\nThe houses are only one story high, but some few have a room over a\r\nmagazine; they are built of stones and mortar, and some of wood or straw.\r\nThe streets are narrow, few of them admit of the passage of two camels\r\nabreast. Several covered bazaars are built for merchandize. There are no\r\nnative manufactures of consequence. Timbuctoo is properly a commercial\r\ndepôt or emporium. The principal medium of exchange is salt, which is\r\nvery inconvenient. The grand desideratum of merchants is the acquisition\r\nand accumulation of gold, but this is obtained only by a long and\r\nwearying residence in Timbuctoo, and is very uncertain in supply. The\r\ngold is brought from a considerable distance south-west. Jinnee is a\r\ngreater place of trade than Timbuctoo. The neighbouring country is flat\r\nand sandy, stretching in plains over the alluvial deposits of the Niger.\r\nThere are no fruit-trees or gardens, beyond the growing of a few melons\r\nand vegetables; but trees abound on the vast plains of Timbuctoo, and\r\nthere is a great number of the Tholh, or gum-bearing acacia. The\r\ncommunication between Jinnee and Timbuctoo is principally by water, and\r\nwith light boats the journey can be accomplished in seven days, but the\r\ndistance is a month by land. The navigation of the Niger is extremely\r\ndifficult, and in the dry season the boats are continually grounding,\r\nwhilst in the wet season people are in constant dread of being\r\nprecipitated on the rocks. The boats have no sails, and are pushed along\r\nby poles with great labour. There is no water in the city: it is brought\r\nfrom pits east and west, a quarter of a mile distant,--that from the east\r\nbeing brackish, and that from the west sweet. Water is sold in the\r\nstreets of Timbuctoo, as in many African cities. The Maroquine merchants\r\nlive in style and luxury at Timbuctoo, and tea, coffee, and sugar may be\r\nobtained from them at a reasonable price. The residence of an European at\r\nTimbuctoo may, perhaps, be considered secure for a short time; but the\r\ngrand difficulty is to get there, and when you get there, to get safe\r\nback again. These details are not very interesting, and I should not have\r\nmentioned them, but for the general anxiety there still exists to obtain\r\ncorrect and recent information of this celebrated Nigritian city.\r\n\r\n_1st February._--The streets of Ghat begin to be deserted. Touaricks are\r\ngoing, and gone, as well as the various merchants from neighbouring\r\ncountries. So I walk with much freedom in the streets. Have not been\r\nmolested about religion for some time; but a man said to me to day,\r\n\"Unless you believe in Mahomet, you will burn in the fire for ever!\"\r\nStrange anomaly this in the conduct of men! They deliver over their\r\nfellow-men to everlasting torments, as if it was some slight corporal\r\ncastigation! . . . . Saw Hateetah. The Consul is still at war with Haj\r\nIbrahim; but he is cutting his own throat, and not the merchant's, by his\r\nfoolish conduct. A low Ghat fellow came in, and finding me writing,\r\nbegins crying out:--\"Oh, you are writing our country! You are coming\r\nafterwards to destroy it! Never was our country written before, and it\r\nshall not be now!\" I turned him out of doors. He then fetched a mob of\r\n\"lewd fellows of the baser sort,\" and began wheying, whooing. Hateetah\r\nluckily came by at the time, and belaboured them with his spear, and off\r\nthey ran, wheying whooing. Went to see them pack up senna, or rather\r\nchange the sacks, those in which it had been packed in Aheer being worn\r\nout. The sacks are made of palm-leaves. Here were lying some hundred\r\nlarge bundles. I am not surprised these simple people wonder what we do\r\nwith senna, and are the more surprised when I tell them it is for\r\nmedicine. Medicine they take little of; and then they have no conception\r\nof the millions of Christians in Europe, thinking we are so many\r\nislanders squatting upon the oases of the watery ocean. The senna leaves,\r\non account of the late rains, are finer and broader than usual: they are\r\nvery large, and, except the edges, of a dark purple hue. There is a good\r\ndeal of small wood (stalks of the plant), and here and there a few yellow\r\nflowers, besides a quantity of dust and dirt mixed up with the leaves.\r\n\r\nSeveral detachments of the return Soudan caravan left to-day. Went to see\r\nthem off. It was amusing to be present at the preparations for departing.\r\nSome just starting, some packing up, others loading, others weighing the\r\ncamels' burdens, others saluting their friends, all in busy and\r\ndistracting confusion. Strings of camels were in advance, with their\r\nheads towards Berkat. I sighed with regret. I wished to follow . . . .\r\nThe camels are tied one after another, held together by strings in their\r\nnose, and they are not allowed to graze during the march, like the camels\r\nof Arabs. This is an advantage to the traveller, for much time is lost by\r\nthe camels cropping herbage on the way. The files of camels are twenty\r\nand thirty in number, and sometimes these files are double. I imagine in\r\nmountainous districts they are untied, otherwise one camel slipping or\r\nfalling, would draw another after it, and, so the whole line would be\r\nthrown in confusion. In the palms noticed two small birds, white bodies,\r\nhead and wings black. With the exception of the diminutive singing\r\nsparrow, and a few crows, these are all the birds I have seen in the\r\noasis. Saw several Aheer Touaricks just arrived, and found them tall,\r\nwell-made, comparatively fair, and fine-featured; nothing of the Negro\r\ncharacter about them. All extremely civil to me; and I certainly like\r\nthem as well, if not better, than the ordinary run of Ghat Touaricks.\r\nThese Aheer Touaricks must be one of the finest races of men in Central\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nWent as usual to spend the evening with Haj Ibrahim. Had not sat down\r\nmany minutes before a thundering knocking was heard at the outer door. An\r\nArab youth called out, \"Who's there?\" and \"Don't open,\" to the slave that\r\nhad the charge of the court-yard door. The knocking increased in fury,\r\nthe tumult of voices without being terrific; and Haj Ibrahim, at last,\r\nrecognizing the party, and yielding to their violence, said \"Open.\" As\r\nsoon as the door was thrown back, in poured a host of Touaricks, like\r\nthe opening of a deluging sluice, all belonging to Berka, headed by their\r\nacting chief, the redoubtable Giant! Their first object was to abuse\r\nroundly the Arab youth who had called out, \"Don't open.\" The merchants of\r\nGhadames and Tripoli try to shut out the Touaricks as much as possible\r\nall times of the day, and especially just at supper-time, for this is the\r\nhour when the Touaricks prowl about for their evening meal, like famished\r\nevening wolves, seeking whom and what they can devour. Prowling for food\r\nis an absolute necessity with them, for generally they have no food; they\r\nbring only a very small quantity from their native districts, when they\r\nleave to spend some weeks at the Souk. This foraging party therefore came\r\nin for supper. Haj Ibrahim tried to work up his courage into rage; but it\r\nwas useless, for his struggling ire was at once choked and quelled by the\r\naccents of thunder which The Giant belched out like old Ætna. The Giant\r\nopened fire upon the trembling merchant, by asserting the safety and\r\ntranquillity of the country: \"There are no robbers or free-booters here;\r\nyou buy and sell, fill your bags with money, and are in peace. Why, then,\r\ncannot we eat as the price of our protection?\" Resistance being very\r\nmadness, the supper which Haj Ibrahim had prepared for himself, was\r\nbrought out to them, the servant crying out, not \"Il pranzo è servito!\"\r\nbut, \"This is all the supper we have for ourselves!\" And like a wise\r\nsteward, he kept a little back for his lord and master. After unbroken\r\nsilence, which lasted full ten minutes, when every person seemed to be\r\ngasping for breath to speak, and struggling with some terrible inward\r\ncommotion of the spirit, the supper-hunting Touaricks made a\r\nsimultaneous move towards the supper-bowl. About nine big brawny fellows\r\nattacked the savoury cuscusou, for Haj Ibrahim had the best kind of\r\nprovisions brought from Tripoli. The dainty merchant told me he could not\r\neat what was made in Ghat. Now, The Giant did not join the onslaught on\r\nthe merchant's supper, that did not beseem his dignity as heir of the\r\nSheikhdom of the venerable Berka! The chief of the gang, on the principle\r\nof delicacy and generosity, left the spoil to his men. The Giant, like\r\nNeptune rising to quell the fury of the tempest, sat reclining in dignity\r\nand authority, with a serene brow, calmly looking on, and smoking his\r\npipe. Not a word was uttered, not a sound was heard, but the licking up\r\nthe food, and the smacking of the lips of these uncouth, unbidden,\r\nuninvited guests. As soon as the supper was swallowed up, (only a few\r\nminutes,) they all arose, The Giant first rising, with unabashed\r\neffrontery, and led the way out. In another moment they were gone! and\r\nthe door was shut. It was like some broken and distempered slumber, and\r\nthe lamps having nearly burnt out, and all being dim and dark, rendered\r\nthe illusion complete. The quondam _protégé_ of these chiefs was too ill,\r\ntoo much upset, to speak. I bade him good night, and returned home,\r\nhalf-admiring The Giant and his troop, and abusing the foolish parsimony\r\nof the merchant, who ought to have thrown a few lumps of flesh to these\r\nhungry and wolfish sons of The Desert, and satisfied them at once. One of\r\nthe party was Hateetah's brother; and Hateetah told me next day that he\r\nhimself sent them.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--Our departure is now finally fixed for to-morrow. The weather is\r\ncool, but not so cold as on my arrival. Within the last three weeks it\r\nhas gradually become warmer, and the spring enlivening warmth will soon\r\nbe succeeded by summer's burning reign. Took a very pleasant walk round\r\nthe Governor's palace, and made a sketch of it, which is subjoined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIrrigation is the grand means of agricultural production in Sahara.\r\nWithout irrigation the oases would be mere halting-places for caravans,\r\nand would afford but a scanty supply for centres of human existence. But\r\nirrigation has not only sustained and sustains the towns and cities of\r\nthe African Desert, but in Asia it has always been the grand means of\r\nmaintaining vast populations. The Assyrians of ancient days became great\r\nby irrigation. In the prophets we read, \"The waters made him (the\r\nAssyrian) great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running\r\nround about his plants, and sent out her little rivers unto all the trees\r\nof the field. Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of\r\nthe field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long\r\nbecause of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth. All the fowls of\r\nheaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the\r\nbeasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt\r\nall great nations. Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of\r\nhis branches: for his root was by great waters.\" (Ezek. xxxi. 4-7.) The\r\nmetaphors are extremely explicit and beautiful, making water the source\r\nof the Assyrian greatness. Nothing can show more the power of water in\r\nthe hot and dry climate of Syria. But the prophet particularly alludes to\r\nthe system of irrigation, as practised on the banks of the Euphrates,\r\nfrom which river the waters were conveyed in small streamlets and\r\nconduits, \"running round about the plants\" in the gardens, and sent out\r\nto a considerable distance in little rills to all the trees of the field.\r\nThe immense parterres of Babylon, artificial gardens supported by\r\nirrigation, have been celebrated by the historians of antiquity. In Ghat,\r\nGhadames, and other oases of the Sahara, as well as the greater part of\r\nthe Tripoline coast, this system of irrigation is now practised to its\r\nfull extent, and water here shows a power of production with which we are\r\nunacquainted in more humid and temperate climes. At this time, the barley\r\nand wheat are shooting up simply under the power of water, which is\r\nconveyed to them by small ducts of earth, as drawn up from the wells,\r\nevery four or five days. A bullock, or slave, draws up the water from the\r\nwells, which are of very rude construction, but answer the purpose. The\r\nwater is then poured into a receiver of earth or stone, from which it\r\nruns into the small conduits of earth. Sometimes the main conduits are\r\nmade of lime-mortar, as in the island of Jerbah. The field to be\r\nirrigated is divided into small squares or compartments, sometimes oblong\r\nof about seven by five feet in size; each is edged up with a small\r\nembankment of earth; between each line of squares run parallel ducts or\r\ngutters of earth, communicating with one large and common conduit, which\r\nis usually placed, to run better, on the highest part of the field, and\r\nas nearly as possible cutting it into halves. Whilst the water is being\r\ndrawn up, a lad opens each compartment of the field with a hoe or\r\nshovel-hoe, and lets the water into each square, shutting it up again\r\nwhen the surface of the ground is merely covered with water. I have seen\r\nthem tread upon the springing blades of grass when so irrigating them, to\r\ngive their roots more force and tenacity in the ground. In Ghat this\r\nirrigation is repeated every five days, or less, until the grain is in\r\nthe ear and nearly ripe.\r\n\r\nThe Medina Shereef, who expresses sincere sympathy for my state of\r\n\"judicial blindness,\" told me to-day that I should not go down to\r\nthe real _bonâ fide_ pit or abode of perdition, but to a dull\r\nshadowy place, \"the region of nothings,\" and I might get out again\r\nand ascend to _Jennah_, (‮جنّة‬) \"paradise;\" and this, because I\r\nwas near to them (the Mussulmans), and read and wrote Arabic, and was\r\nnot afraid to write or repeat a verse of the Koran. In our prophets\r\nwe have, \"Thus saith the Lord, In the day when he went down to the\r\ngrave I caused a mourning.\" (Ezek. xxxi. 15.) \"I made the nations to\r\nshake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with\r\nthem that descend into the pit.\" (Id. 16.) \"They also went down to\r\nhell with him.\" (Id. 17.) In the first verse cited ‮שאלה‬ is\r\ntranslated \"grave,\" in the two latter verses \"hell.\" But there is no\r\nreason for the alteration of the term from \"grave\" to \"hell.\" The\r\nprophets I imagine, like most of us, had extremely indistinct\r\nnotions of the future world, and the place of disembodied spirits,\r\nand were accustomed to use the word ‮שאלה‬ (which ought invariably\r\nto be translated grave, or hades, and not hell,) something in the\r\nsame manner as my friend the Shereef, for a dreary shadowy region of\r\nimperfect beings or non-entities, a nether limbo of nothings and\r\nvanities.\r\n\r\nTook a walk to see the merchants leaving for Soudan; many of them were\r\naccompanied a short distance by their friends. It is an affecting thing\r\nto part with people who are about to enter upon forty days of Desert,\r\nwithout a human habitation, (the route from this to Aheer.) Saw Hateetah\r\nin my walk. He took a shumlah, or girdle, by force from Haj Ibrahim. The\r\nConsul found the auctioneer going round with it for sale, and inquiring\r\nto whom it belonged, and hearing it was Haj Ibrahim's, he took the sash\r\nfrom the auctioneer and told him to go and acquaint the merchant with\r\nwhat he had done, and which sash he had taken instead of the turban,\r\noffered to Hateetah by Haj Ibrahim, but refused on account of its little\r\nvalue. This is a nasty trick to say the least, but as the Moorish\r\nauctioneer observed, \"Such is the way with the Touaricks.\" However, I am\r\npersuaded neither Jabour, nor Khanouhen, would have stooped to such a\r\nshabby dirty manœuvre. It seems besides, Haj Ibrahim is giving great\r\nprovocation to the chiefs who are appointed his protectors at the Souk.\r\nThey complain that, whilst he brings as many goods as twenty ordinary\r\nmerchants, he gives less than any one. So we must hear both sides of the\r\nquestion. Saw to-day the Moorish Kady of Ghat for the first time: I had\r\nnot made his acquaintance. His son I knew, who was very impertinent,\r\ninsisting that I should give him some tea because he was the son of the\r\nKady. This I refused to do, and Khanouhen praised my conduct and said, I\r\nbehaved \"like a Touarghee!\" The Kady is an old gentleman, but dresses\r\nsuperbly in a fine red turban and long flowing bright-green coat, in full\r\nsacerdotal character, as the triple-crowned Pope of Ghat. This morning I\r\ntook upon myself to scold severely some Ghadamsee merchants for\r\nintroducing the subject of religion before the ignorant people of Ghat\r\nand Soudan. I found a group of them in the streets when they wanted to\r\nspeak of religion. I asked them \"If they would do so in Tripoli, and if\r\nnot, why here?\" They understood the point of censure and immediately left\r\noff. Some Arabs present, said, \"You are right, Yâkob.\" Vexed at my\r\nreproof, they attacked me on the subject of slaves, asking me why the\r\nEnglish disapproved of slaves? I replied sharply, \"It is not our religion\r\nto buy and sell men, though it may be your religion.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Governor's I observed the style of cutting and braiding\r\nfashionable young ladies' hair, in the example of his daughters. The\r\nforehead is shaved high up, leaving, however, one long curl or _with_ of\r\nhair depending. This curl is braided and hangs down gracefully over the\r\nforehead. On each side of the head, over the ears, depend three other\r\nseparate curls or locks of hair, each double-braided. Behind the head\r\nhang also two other longer curls, and each double-braided. Between these\r\ncurls, as they detach themselves from the head, the cranium is clean\r\nshaven, and the hair or tuft on the crown of the head, whence the several\r\ncurls depend, covers a very small space. At the end of the braided curls\r\nis tied a piece of coloured string or narrow ribbon, the same as is done\r\namongst our little dressy nymphs. The hair is dressed with olive-oil or\r\ndaubed over with semen, or liquid butter. My old negress landlady is a\r\nhair-dresser of the first style, and the fashionable negresses come to\r\nhave their woolly crispy locks dressed by her _secundum artem_ nearly\r\nevery day. This hair-dressing takes place on my terrace, and affords me a\r\nsplendid field for observation. I ought to have brought with me into The\r\nDesert the book, \"How to observe,\" in order to have given a complete and\r\nsatisfactory description of the fashionable Libyo-Saharan hair-dressing.\r\nThe old lady sits down, spreading out her knees, and the young sable\r\nbelle throws herself flat at full length sprawling on the terrace floor,\r\nputting her head into the lap of the arbitress of The Desert toilette,\r\nher heels meanwhile kicking up, and sometimes not very decently. The\r\noperation then commences. The woolly locks, not more than three inches in\r\nlength, are gradually drawn up tight to the crown of the head, and\r\nplaited in tiers in the shape of a high ridge, whilst they are being\r\nrubbed over with liquid butter. The lower circle of the cranium is left\r\nall bare, not a curl depending, and is shaven quite clean. But this is\r\ndone previously, for my old negress does not undertake the profession of\r\nshaver, with her other important services. The hair, when fully dressed\r\nin this style, assumes the shape of an oval crown, or the head part of\r\nthe helmet. Some negresses use false tails as well as false locks, as our\r\nbelles do, the long flowing curls being preferred by the sooty Nigritian\r\nbeauties, in spite of such an ornament being unnatural to them. These\r\nladies, however, neither paint nor tattoo their faces, and in general,\r\npainting with red and white is not used by the Libyan and Oriental\r\nbeauties. In Algeria, however, some of the Mooresses have learnt to paint\r\nfrom their new mistresses, as an acquirement of French civilization in\r\nAfrica. Dr. Shaw is quite right in his new rendering of the passage\r\nreferring to Jezebel, \"And she adjusted (or set off) her eyes with the\r\npowder of lead-ore,\" (2 Kings ix. 30,) which in the common version is,\r\n\"And she painted her face,\" (or, in the margin, \"put her eyes in\r\npainting\"). This painting of the eyelids is a custom of great antiquity.\r\nIt has the effect of of giving the eye a peculiar prominency, enlarging\r\nits apparent size, and adding to it a greater bewitching force. The\r\nTouarick women, however, disdain the unnatural adornment, and shame the\r\nunmanly conduct of certain of the Saharan men who actually paint thus\r\ntheir eyelids. It is a trite saying, that women are coquettes all the\r\nworld over. But if mothers will educate their daughters so, it must be\r\nso. Besides cheerful young ladies are frequently confounded with\r\ncoquettes, which is very unfair. Here, of course, there is coquetry as\r\nelsewhere. Why not? I have two neighbours, Negresses, and sisters, who\r\nget upon the house-top every morning, wash their faces, and oil them to\r\nmake them shine, as it is said, \"Man had given him oil to make his face\r\nto shine.\" They then dress one another's hair, which usually occupies\r\nthem all the morning. The toilette here, as with us, is a very serious\r\naffair. These sable beauties sometimes play the coquette with me, which\r\nis innocent enough. I asked my old negress about these and other coloured\r\nresidents, and found there were many families of free negroes in Ghat. My\r\nfriendly coquetting neighbours have a brother who is a free Negro and\r\ntrades between Ghat and Soudan. A few of the free Negroes are perhaps\r\n_bonâ fide_ immigrants, but these are really very limited. The dress of\r\nthe women in this place is extremely simple; it consists solely of a\r\nchemise and a short-sleeved frock, with a barracan used as a shawl, and\r\nthrown over the head and shoulders, when there is wind or cold. The\r\nladies have sandals, and some of them shoes. Beads are esteemed only by\r\nNegresses. Those particular beads made of a composition of clay at Venice\r\nand Trieste, are now the fashion. The Touarick ladies prefer pieces of\r\ncoral and charms strung round their neck in necklaces. The arms, wrists,\r\nand ancles are hooped with wood-painted, and generally, metal armlets,\r\nbracelets, and anclets. Some ladies hang a small looking-glass about\r\ntheir necks, which is, of course in frequent use. The Touarick women\r\nindustriously weave the woollen tobes, jibbahs, or frocks; they are very\r\ncheap, warm, and comfortable in the water. But the Soudan cottons are the\r\ngreat Saharan consumption. There are also now introduced from Europe\r\nquantities of, I think, what are called \"Indians\" in mercantile slang, or\r\ncoarse white cottons. The merchants call them \"new\". These cottons are\r\nmuch liked in Morocco because they are cheap and pleasant clothing in\r\nsummer. Men and women are clothed with them, and they are made up into\r\nevery kind of dress. These European cottons are supplanting those of\r\nSoudan, which furnish work for thousands in Central Africa. So the\r\nlegitimate commerce, already so limited, is diminishing instead of\r\nincreasing. Poor Africa! thrice-poor, and every way poor, gets nothing at\r\npresent by her intercourse with Europe, saving the enslavement of her\r\nunhappy children, and the impoverishment of her native manufactures. The\r\nNiger and other _philanthropic_ and commercial expeditions have only laid\r\nbare her nakedness--they have not advanced her one step in the scale of\r\nimprovement. Connected with Saharan female dress is naturally that of\r\nfemale beauty. The _beau ideal_ of an Arab beauty, according to the\r\nArabian poets Havivi and Montannibi, is, that \"Her person should be\r\nslender like the bending rush, or taper lance of Yemen.\" This is also the\r\n_beau ideal_ of female beauty amongst Touaricks. I have seen no fat\r\nfed-up women amongst Touaricks, like those in such esteem and the\r\n_bon-ton_ of the Moors. The _enbonpoint_ of Mooresses is well known, and\r\nbeauty amongst them is literally by the weight. Recent discoveries in\r\nMalta have made us acquainted with this _enbonpoint_, as an essential\r\nfeature of female or other beauty in the most early times, say as far\r\nback as the Carthaginian and other ancient settlers in Malta. The rude\r\nstatues lately dug up in that island are all remarkable for obese\r\nprocesses from the waist downwards.\r\n\r\nThe taste of the Arabs has been greatly vitiated, and the slight, spare,\r\n\"bending rush\" is often rejected for the bridal beauty who requires a\r\ncamel to carry her to the house of her husband. The Moors resident in\r\nGhat have imported the vicious Moorish ideas, and the Negress slaves are\r\nfattened for the market, and fetch higher prices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe dress of Touarick men is more elaborate than that of their\r\nwomen. The principal garment is the Soudanic cotton frock,\r\nsmock-frock, or blouse, sometimes called tobe, with short and wide\r\nopen sleeves, and wide body reaching below the knee. Under this is\r\nat times worn a small shirt. The pantaloons are also of the same\r\ncotton, not very wide in the leggings, and scarcely reaching to the\r\nancles, and something in the Cossack style. The frock is confined\r\nlow round the waist with the \"leather girdle,\" and often by a sash\r\nin the style of the Spaniards. There is generally attached to it a\r\ngood-sized red leather bag, not unlike an European lady's work-bag,\r\nand this is made into various compartments, one for tobacco, one for\r\nsnuff, one for trona or ghour nuts, another for striking-light\r\nmatters, another for needles and thread, another containing a little\r\nlooking-glass, &c., &c.; and I have seen a Touarghee fop\r\nadjust his toilette with as much coquetry as the most brilliant\r\nflirt,--indeed, the vanity of some of these Targhee dandies\r\nsurpasses all our notions of vanity in European dress. Over the\r\nfrock, on one of the shoulders, is carried the barracan or hayk,\r\nwhich is sometimes cotton, and white and blue-striped, or figured in\r\nchecks, of Timbuctoo manufacture, but generally a plain woollen\r\nwrapper. The hayk is wound several times round the body, and is the\r\nonly real protection the Touarick, or his wife, (for the women\r\nlikewise wear them,) has, from the cutting cold winds of The Sahara.\r\nA red or white cap sometimes covers the naked shaved head, but many\r\ndo not wear a cap, as besides many do not shave the head. But the\r\ngrand distinguishing object in the dress of Touarick men is the\r\n_Lithām_ (‮اللثام‬), from which article of dress the Touaricks\r\nhave been called ages ago by historian and tourists of The Desert \"The\r\npeople of the Litham\" (‮اهل اللثام‬). The litham is nothing\r\nmore than a thin wrapper, which is first wound round the head, and then\r\nmade to cover the whole of the forehead and partially the eyes, and\r\nthe lower part of the face, especially the mouth. The mouth and the\r\neyes are the two grand objects to protect in The Desert, and in\r\nSaharan travelling, equally against heat and cold, and wind. A\r\nSaharan traveller, having his mouth well covered with the litham,\r\nwill go at least twenty-four hours longer, fasting in abstinence,\r\nwhilst his lips will not be parched with thirst. The litham shelters\r\nthe eyes effectually from the hot sand grains, borne on the deadly\r\nwing of the Simoom. A turban is mostly folded round the head as a\r\nmark of orthodox Islamism. The young beaux prefer the great red sash\r\nwound round the head in shape of the turban.\r\n\r\nThe Touarick, from his habit of wearing the litham, does not like a\r\nbeard, which, indeed, could rarely be seen. As it grows, they pull it\r\nout, and so in time it often disappears altogether. In the matter of\r\nbeard, the almost sacred ornament of the Moor and the Arab, the Touarick\r\nis placed again in strong contrast with his Mahometan neighbour. All wear\r\na profusion of talismans suspended round the neck, or sewn or stuck about\r\nthe head, like so many liberty or election cockades. This is the usual\r\nstyle of the dress of Touaricks; and, with dagger under the left arm,\r\nsword swung from the back, and spear in the right hand, it looks\r\nsufficiently novel and imposing, befitting the wild scenery and wild sons\r\nof The Desert. Many, however, of the Touaricks go almost naked, whilst\r\nthe younger Sheikhs occasionally indulge in the foreign fashions of the\r\nMoors of the north, dressing very fantastically and elaborately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n_3rd._--Our departure from Ghat to Mourzuk, capital of Fezzan, is now\r\nagain finally fixed for the 5th of the month, at least three weeks\r\ndelayed beyond the time first spoken of. European travellers in Sahara\r\nmust always reckon upon these wearying delays. A ghafalah is just arrived\r\nfrom Fezzan, bringing dates, ghusub, and wheat. This is a most seasonable\r\nrelief, for absolutely there is no food left for the poorer inhabitants\r\nof Ghat, the provisions being carried away by various caravans which have\r\nleft us within a few days. I was myself obliged to borrow from the\r\nGovernor. Fortunately, Fezzan is near, or the Souk of Ghat, with its\r\nthousand slaves, would be often reduced to great extremities, there being\r\nno capital invested in keeping up a supply of provisions. Haj Ibrahim\r\ncomplains of Hateetah, and considers him the worst of the Touarghee\r\nSheikhs. The merchant \"has reason.\"\r\n\r\nCalled to see Haj Ahmed. Met the Governor near his gardens, and he\r\ninvited me to go and look at them. Was agreeably surprised to find a\r\nreally splendid plantation of date-palms, underneath and amidst which\r\nwere some of the choicest fruits, the fig, pomegranate, and apricot. He\r\nhas also planted some hedges of Indian fig. The plantation might cover a\r\ndozen acres. It is the work of eighteen years of the industrious\r\nMarabout, but the palms are still in their youth, some even in their\r\nchildhood. It is important to mention, this beautiful plantation was a\r\nwaste of sand before the Governor took it in hand, but the whole of it,\r\nby the assistance of water and irrigation, his persevering industry has\r\nmade to bud and \"blossom as the rose.\" Were the rest of the wealthy\r\nresidents to imitate the Marabout, they would in a few years make Ghat a\r\nlarge and most lovely oasis of Desert. Water is complained of as to\r\nsupply, but there is water enough to irrigate an oasis of five times the\r\npresent extent. So in Ghadames, so almost in every Saharan oasis. The\r\nGovernor encourages his sons to industry, by giving each a plot of ground\r\nto cultivate for himself. I saw a fine field belonging to one of his\r\nsons, which has been under culture only three years. It is sown with\r\nbarley and wheat, and planted with rows of sprig-palms, in the very\r\nchildhood of growth; but, by the time the sons of the Marabout are\r\nmarried, and have young families, these green-shooting palm-sprigs will\r\nbe branching trees high up, bearing mature and delicious fruit. Nature\r\nfurnishes pretty and striking lessons of industry, more affecting to the\r\nobservant mind than the lessons of the most eloquent moralist. There are\r\nalso shoots of the fig-tree and the pomegranate set around a pool of\r\ncrystal water, the embryo paradise of the future. The son, whose garden\r\nthis was, said to me, in reply about the supply of water, \"See, the water\r\ncomes from a spring near that hill of sand. I dug the well, and God gave\r\nme the water. God does not give water to all when they dig.\" I went\r\nforward, and saw a refreshing spring bubbling out from beneath the sandy\r\nbosom of The Desert.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a pleasure now to walk about Ghat, the noisy rabble is\r\nhushed, and the Touaricks, excepting some chiefs of Berka, are all gone.\r\nThe remaining Ghadamsee merchants are as pleased as myself that the\r\nTouaricks are gone. A strange hallucination got possession of my brain\r\nto-day. \"I determined I would stop five years in Africa. I would visit\r\nall the great kingdoms of Nigritia. I would write the history and\r\nlegends of the ten thousand tribes of Africa from their own mouths. Then\r\nI would return with these spoils and treasures of Africa to my\r\nfatherland.\" Vain phantoms of ambition, only to fever my poor brain! The\r\nfirst untoward event would lay me prostrate on the burning plains,\r\nleaving my bones scattered and bleaching, a monument to deter and dismay\r\nthe succeeding wanderer of The Desert. . . . . . . One of the occupations\r\nof the poor in this country, by which they get a bit of bread, is\r\nbreaking date-stones, something analogous to our stone-breakers on the\r\nhigh roads. The date-stones are taken one by one, and put on a big round\r\nstone within a circle of a roll of rags, and another stone is used to\r\ncrush or pound them. The pounded stones are sold to fatten sheep and\r\ncamels upon. The poor earn two karoobs (twopence) a day in this manner,\r\non which many are obliged to live. Hard is the lot of the poor in every\r\nclime!\r\n\r\nAfternoon late, I went to the range of Wareerat mountains, to collect a\r\nfew geological specimens, accompanied by a slave. All our senses deceive\r\nus. The world is a world of delusions and deceptions, and we are dupers\r\nand dupes, as it happens. After continuing a couple of hours, the base of\r\nthe range, which seemed always close upon us, still receded and was\r\nreceding. On the plains of Africa bounded by mountain ranges, one is as\r\nmuch at a loss to measure distances as the landsman at sea, when\r\nmeasuring the distance from his ship to the rocks bounding the shore. My\r\nnegro Cicerone advised to beat a retreat, assuring me I should not reach\r\nthe chain by daylight. We looked round on the city and found it fast\r\ndiminishing and disappearing in the distance, in the fleeting twilight of\r\nthe evening. We returned an hour after dark. On the north we espied a few\r\ncamels, a Fezzan provision caravan, winding their slow length along like\r\na line of little black dots in the sand. My companion told me he was\r\ncaptured in war. The people are always fighting; some to get slaves,\r\nothers from \"a bad heart.\" He was afraid to go back to his country for\r\nfear of being recaptured, resold, and made again to recross the Desert.\r\nThe domestic and political history of Africa is an eternal cycle of\r\nmiseries and misfortunes; better that the African world had not been\r\ncreated. My negro companion is called Berka Ben-Omer, to distinguish him\r\nfrom another slave of his master called Berka. Frequently both slaves and\r\nfree men have but one name, or one name is employed in speaking of them.\r\nWhen there are many of the same name in their circle of acquaintance or\r\ntown, then the names of the fathers are used. Joshua, in The Scriptures,\r\nis usually distinguished in this way when his name is mentioned, \"To\r\nJoshua, son of Nun.\" (Joshua ii. 23.) The _Ben_-Omer above, is the \"son\"\r\nof Omer.\r\n\r\nSpent the evening with Haj Ibrahim. Found Hateetah with the merchant.\r\nThey had made it up, and Hateetah told me, in the morning, there was now\r\npeace between him and Haj Ibrahim, since he, Hateetah, had got the large\r\nred sash. The Sheikh related news from Fezzan, respecting the ravages of\r\nthe son of Abd El-Geleel in Bornou, who was attacking the Bornouese\r\ncaravans. Hateetah then made a long speech, in which he recommended me to\r\nthe care of the merchant, calling upon Haj Ibrahim \"To swear by his head\r\nthat he would take as much care of me as of himself.\" This was\r\nunnecessary, for Haj Ibrahim had shown himself more substantially\r\nfriendly to me than any other merchant at Ghat. The Consul excused\r\nhimself for not accompanying me to Fezzan, by stating that his camels had\r\nnot come up from the country districts: this was a mere excuse. But the\r\nroad was perfectly safe, and we did not require the protection of the\r\nSheikh. To-day Hateetah did not beg.\r\n\r\n_4th._--A fine morning, weather very warm and sultry. The town is well\r\nnigh empty. When all the caravans are gone, Ghat will sink into the\r\nstillness of death. This is the case with all the Saharan towns, which\r\nare _blad-es-souk_, \"a mart of trade,\" taking place periodically. The\r\nGovernor finds the trade in slaves so thriving, slaves having fetched a\r\ngood price this year, that he is sending this morning two of his sons to\r\nSoudan to purchase slaves. Kandarka left also this morning. I went to see\r\nhim off. _Saif zain, wahad_, \"A good sword, one!\" he exclaimed as usual.\r\nHe then made me a long speech. \"Put yourself under my sword, no man can\r\nresist the sword of Kandarka! (drawing his sword from the scabbard, and\r\nmaking a cut with it.) Be my witnesses, ye merchants of Ghadames! (some\r\nof whom were present.) I will give you, Yâkob, a good camel, a mahry.\r\nWater you will have first, sweet water. Wood there will be always ready\r\nfor you to make a fire and cook the cuscasou. I am the right hand of\r\nEn-Nour (Sultan of Aheer). You will be my friend, Yâkob, before the\r\nSultan. In our towns, we have cheese, butter, wheat, sheep, bullocks. You\r\nChristians have none like them. Make haste back, make haste, and come to\r\nAheer.\"\r\n\r\nHateetah seldom spoke to me of religion, but to-day the Consul said,\r\n\"What sort of Christian are you? I hear there are as many Christians as\r\nthere are sands\" (taking up a handful of sand).\r\n\r\n_The Author._--\"And what sort of Islamites are you Touaricks? for you are\r\nmany, as many as we.\"\r\n\r\n_The Consul._--\"We are of Sidi Malek:\" (_i. e._, Malekites like Arabs).\r\n\r\nI asked then the Consul what was the meaning of Targhee, who replied\r\nEn-nas, or \"people.\" Indeed, the word Targhee seems to have the same\r\nsignification as Kabyle, that is, \"tribe,\" or \"nation,\" both words\r\ndenoting people of the same original stock.\r\n\r\n_5th._--The morning of our departure! . . . . . At length comes the\r\nend--the end of all things, joys or sorrows--even in The Desert, where\r\ndelay and procrastination are the dull and wearying gods of ceaseless\r\nworship. Rose early to pack up, and pay take-leave visits. Weather is\r\nmild; the caravan will move slowly on account of the slaves; the journey\r\nis short; the route is safe; all things promise a favourable end of my\r\nSaharan tour. The mind looks with regret upon leaving places become\r\nfamiliar, but rises buoyant at the thought of seeing new sights and\r\nscenes. Called upon the Governor to bid him adieu. His Excellency said,\r\nhe should see me at the moment of departing. Found him with some people\r\nof Touat, who said:--\"The English are very devils; they have two eyes\r\nbehind their heads, as well as two before.\" I did not quite understand\r\ntheir allusion. Called on Haj Ibrahim, who had been packing up for three\r\ndays past, and yet things were still in great confusion. To my\r\nastonishment, I found the merchant surrounded with a group of people in\r\nthe greatest excitement, the master-figure of the group being The Giant\r\nSheikh, foaming with rage, and threatening to cut Haj Ibrahim's throat on\r\nthe road, unless he made him some sufficient present, in acknowledgment\r\nof his authority as heir-apparent of the Sheikhdom of Berka. The Ghatee\r\nmerchants, all the most respectable of whom were in this _mêlée_, kept\r\nscreaming, and some of them pulling hold of Haj Ibrahim, to give a\r\ntrifle, (a couple of dollars,) to The Giant, and get rid of him. Hateetah\r\nand other Touaricks were also present. Meantime, The Giant bullied,\r\nmenaced, swore, and thundered things horrible and unutterable . . . . .\r\nAmidst this bedlam din, Haj Ibrahim at length got a hearing, and mustered\r\nup courage enough to defend himself:--\"You call your's a peaceful\r\ncountry,--How? Is not this the conduct of bandits? I know (recognize) no\r\nperson but Berka. Him I have given a present. What was demanded I have\r\ngiven Berka. I will not now give more presents, and not indeed by main\r\nforce. It is robbery! Go and take my camels.\" The Giant, who listened to\r\nthese few words, spoken distinctly and energetically, with a brow\r\novercast, like a storm-cloud charged with the electric fire, and a bosom\r\nheaving and boiling with wrath, got up from where he lay sprawling,\r\n(\"many a rood,\") and very deliberately took hold of his broadsword (I\r\nbegan to be alarmed), and with it fetched Hateetah such a stroke on the\r\nback with its flat side, as made him cry out with pain. Then addressing\r\nhis subordinate sternly and laconically, _Enker, heek_[93], \"Get up\r\nquick.\" he strode off a few paces. Hateetah instantly followed, and the\r\nother Touaricks. Now turned round The Giant, and said in Arabic:--\"Allah\r\nAkbar, the camels! Allah Akbar, the camels! Good, good! Allah Akbar, the\r\ncamels!\" They went off (or rather pretended to go) to seize the\r\nmerchant's camels. These gone, the merchants of Ghat set all upon Haj\r\nIbrahim, \"What a fool you are! Why not give the long fellow a couple of\r\ndollars? If you won't, we shall give the Sheikh the money ourselves.\" One\r\nof them turned to me, \"Why, Christian, what is a couple of dollars to Haj\r\nIbrahim? That's the value?\" (putting his hand to his nose.) The reader\r\nmay easily guess how this stupid obstinacy of the merchant ended. The Haj\r\nforked out, with a bad grace, and the money was carried after The Giant,\r\none of the Ghat merchants adding two more dollars. I was pleased with\r\nthis trait of the Ghateen, who were determined we should not go off in\r\nthis uncomfortable plight. The Giant I did not see again; I regretted to\r\npart with him in this manner. Under his huge and unwieldy exterior he\r\nconcealed the most tender and generous disposition. His Giantship never\r\nbegged of me; and when I gave him a little tobacco, he thanked me a\r\nthousand times. He was always cheerful with, and had some joke for his\r\nfriends. After all, my plan is best: to make the necessary presents at\r\nonce, and voluntarily; to give all the Sheikhs a trifle, and then you are\r\nat peace with all.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 o'clock in the afternoon, to our great satisfaction, we got clear\r\nand clean off. Hateetah came out to see me start, and walked half a mile\r\nwith me on the road. He was extremely kind. It is probable, he begged of\r\nme so much, because his brothers and cousins incited him, amongst whom I\r\nknow he shared the presents which he received. I now put my hand in my\r\npocket, and gave him all the money I had left, half a dollar and a\r\nkaroob! He affectionately shook me with both hands. I then passed the\r\nGovernor, who was waiting for us. His Excellency shook hands very\r\nfriendly, and said, \"And Ellah, Yâkob\" (God be with you, James!)\r\n\r\nDuring my fifty days' residence in Ghat, although I received numberless\r\npetty insults, I kept out of all squabbles, and made as few complaints as\r\npossible to the authorities. In fact, I may safely say, and without\r\npresumption on my part, if I could not live in peace with these people a\r\nfew weeks, no other European coming after me could.\r\n\r\nIt is now time to make a few observations upon the general character of\r\nthese Saharan inhabitants, and compare their social state with that of\r\nours in Europe.\r\n\r\nCrime against society, consists mainly in lying or duplicity, and\r\nimposture, in thieving, in sensuality, and in murder. Veracity, honesty,\r\ncontinence, and respect for human life, distinguish a moral people. We\r\nhave to try the Saharan populations of Ghat and Ghadames by these four\r\ncardinal points or principles, and compare them with the nations of\r\nEurope. Whilst resident in Ghadames, not one single case of cutting or\r\nmaiming, or manslaughter, occurred, nor did I hear of any in neighbouring\r\ncountries. Of course, I exclude altogether the depredations of a nation\r\nor tribe of robbers, as well as all the skirmishes between the Touaricks\r\nand the Shânbah, which have nothing to do with the question of the\r\nsocial condition of the Saharan towns that I visited. In Ghat, three\r\ncases of cutting and wounding occurred, the gashes on the arms received\r\nby two slaves from a Touarghee, and the attack on the Ghadamsee trader\r\nwhilst at prayers, also by a Touarghee. These are the only cases which\r\noccurred during my residence here, although a mart or fair, and the\r\nrendezvous of tribes of people from all parts of Central Africa and the\r\nGreat Desert! . . . . . So much for the sacredness of human life among\r\nthe barbarians of The Desert! . . . . . . With respect to theft and\r\nthieving, I have already noticed that thieving is only practised by the\r\nhungry and starved slaves of these towns, that amongst the people of\r\nGhadames, as likewise amongst the Touaricks, theft is unknown as a crime.\r\nThe exceptional cases of theft which are brought to notice can be easily\r\ntraced to strangers. The Touaricks certainly at times levy black-mail in\r\nopen Desert, but do not rob in the towns; and the black-mail is not\r\nconsidered by themselves as theft, nor, indeed, is it strictly such,\r\nbeing exacted by the Touaricks as transit duties, or as presents for\r\nprotection through their districts, or as tribute, and under a variety of\r\nsuch reasons and pretensions. What is legally fixed on the Continent of\r\nEurope, is here left to the caprice and greediness of the Sheikhs, and\r\nthe liberality or stinginess of the trader. As to incontinence, this is\r\nmore a secret crime. But the sexual habits of the Touaricks, and their\r\ndomestic amours, are purity itself, compared to the sensuality which\r\ndisfigures and saps the vitals of society in all the southern nations of\r\nEurope. The hardships of The Desert are the greatest safeguards against\r\nindulgence in, or the pleasures of, an emasculating sensuality amongst\r\nthe Touaricks, whilst the ascetic habits of the Maraboutish city of\r\nGhadames sufficiently protect that people from the general indulgence of\r\nlibertinism, and unnatural crimes. Intoxication, or habitual drunkenness,\r\nis, of course, unknown in these Saharan regions. An inebriated woman\r\nwould be such a wonder as is described in the Book of the Revelations. As\r\nto veracity, I have told the reader, the Touarghee nation is a \"one-word\"\r\npeople. We cannot expect the same thing from the commercial and\r\nmake-money habits of the Moors of Ghadames, but they rank much higher for\r\nveracity than the Moors of The Coast, which latter have the _superior_\r\nadvantages of direct European contact. In my estimate of Saharan\r\npopulations, I have confined myself to Ghat and Ghadames; the oases of\r\nFezzan, and the city of Mourzuk, have become too much vitiated by contact\r\nwith The Coast and the Turks for affording fair specimens of Saharan\r\ntribes. Let us then compare what has been said to those hideous scenes of\r\ncrime, of immodesty, and drunkenness, which abound in the great cities of\r\nEurope--the ever-present, ever-during stigma on our boasted\r\ncivilization!--and ask the paradoxical question, What do we gain by\r\nEuropean and Christian civilization? We have Chambers of Legislature,\r\ninfallible and omnipotent Parliaments, princes full of the enlightenment\r\nof the age, and reigning by divine right, or the sovereignty of the\r\npeople, or what not;--we have hierarchies of priests and ministers of\r\nreligion, we have a Divine revelation;--we have philosophers, poets, and\r\nrhetoricians, all enforcing the sublime morals of the age, with reason or\r\nfancy and the attractions of the most cultivated intellect;--we have\r\nscience exhausting nature by its discoveries;--we have our fine arts,\r\nand the arts to humanize and exalt the characters of men;--we have our\r\nbenevolent, philanthropic, and scientific societies;--we profess to\r\ngovern the destinies of the world, to direct the intellect of all\r\nnations, and to advance the being of man to the enjoyment of immortal,\r\nimperishable life! ........ And what else profess we not to do? Now then,\r\nwhat are the results? We have the governing authorities of a neighbouring\r\npeople a mass of corruption[94];--we have the States of the North, so\r\nlittle acquainted with the arts and justice of Government that planned\r\nconspiracies and consequent massacres of whole classes are now and then\r\nhad recourse to, and found requisite to preserve the apparent order of\r\nsociety. Amongst ourselves, we Englishmen, have in all our great cities,\r\nthe frightful excrescences of crime, too frightful for the pure and\r\nsimple-minded Saharan tribes to look upon. Our common habits of\r\nintoxication and intemperance, and the intoxication of our women, would\r\nmake the Desert man or woman shrink away from us with horror. Our country\r\nis filled with prisons, all well tenanted, whilst the Desert cities have\r\nno one thing in the shape or form of a prison. Then look at the Thuggism\r\nand open-day assassinations of Ireland! In truth, these Saharan\r\nmalefactors are the veriest minutest fry of offenders, the minnows and\r\ngudgeons of guilt compared to the Irish Thuggee of Tipperary[95].\r\nPoverty is the giant of our United Kingdom, and the incarnate demon of\r\nunhappy Ireland; and, with us, people die of starvation....... The\r\nDesert, on the contrary, offers the strongest parallel of contrast\r\npossible. Poverty there is, but it is wealth compared to ours, and our\r\nwants, and no person that I heard of, whilst resident in The Desert, died\r\nof starvation. Of course, I omit the traffic in slaves, which has nothing\r\nto do with the social state of the Saharan towns I am describing. I omit\r\nlikewise the condition of the Arabs of the Tripoline mountains, and the\r\nterrible exactions of the Turks upon them and other provinces in Tripoli,\r\nwhich indeed are a part of the European system I am now animadverting\r\nupon. But I shall stop this tone and style of animadversion. I am sick at\r\nheart with the parallel of contrasts between our barbarian and civilized\r\nsocial systems: it is so unsatisfactory, it is so disheartening, and\r\ntakes away all hope, all faith in the progress and perfectibility of the\r\nhuman race. One thing, however, is certain, that unless we can bring our\r\nminds to form a just appreciation of ourselves, unless we can learn to\r\nknow ourselves, there is no hope, no chance of advancing in our social\r\nand moral condition.\r\n\r\nOur slave caravan stretched across the plain or bed of the Wady of Ghat\r\neastwards, to the black range of Wareerat, and turning round abruptly\r\nnorth by some sand hills, we encamped after three hours. It is from this\r\nplace the Ghat townspeople fetch their wood. The fire-wood is gathered\r\nfrom the lethel tree. Our caravan consists of eleven camels, five\r\nmerchants or proprietors, some half dozen servants and about fifty or\r\nsixty slaves. I have my nagah and Said, as before. Nearly all the slaves\r\nare the property of Haj Ibrahim. They are mostly young women and girls.\r\nThere are a few boys and three children. The poor things on leaving Ghat,\r\nas is their wont on encountering The Desert, got up a song in choruses,\r\nto give an impetus to their feelings in starting. For myself, The Desert\r\nhas become my most familiar friend. I felt happy in again spreading my\r\npallet upon its naked bosom, by a shady bush of the Lethel.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[93] ‮انكر هيك‬, the Touarghee language.\r\n\r\n[94] As to what has taken place, and is happening by the\r\n    introduction of what is called _French_ civilization into Africa\r\n    (Algeria), and how the morals of the people, natives and\r\n    foreigners, are affected, the things are too horrible to be here\r\n    related. The annals of Norfolk Island, and the Bagnes of Toulon,\r\n    would be outraged by their recital.\r\n\r\n[95] I should be sorry to apply to a minister of any religion the\r\n    opprobrious epithet of a \"Surpliced Ruffian.\" It would seem,\r\n    however, that Archdeacon Laffan aspires to the \"bad eminence\" of\r\n    the apologist of assassins. What would my readers say, were I to\r\n    report the Ministers of Islamism in The Desert to be the abettors\r\n    of assassination? Or what would they have said, if a priest had\r\n    been found to be the secret or open instigator of the\r\n    _quasi_-bandit Ouweek, in his violent threat to murder me, because\r\n    I chanced to be a Christian, or rather, a non-believer in Mahomet.\r\n    We should not have found words sufficiently strong to express our\r\n    reprobation of such priestly intolerance and wickedness. And yet\r\n    Ouweek would have only acted out his religious principles in their\r\n    stern literality,--‮قتلواهم‬--\"_kill them_\" (the infidels),\r\n    as frequently written in the inexorable Koran; whilst Archdeacon\r\n    Laffan's preaching is diametrically opposed to his religion, whose\r\n    holy and clement command contrariwise is,--\"to forgive our\r\n    enemies, and bless those who curse us.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nFROM GHAT TO MOURZUK.\r\n\r\n     Slaves very sensible to the Cold.--Well of Tasellam.--Saharan\r\n     Huntsman.--Atmospheric Phenomenon.--My Adventure at the Palace of\r\n     Demons.--Denham and Oudney's Account of the Kesar Jenoun.--The\r\n     Genii of Mussulmans.--Desert Pandemonium compared with that of\r\n     Milton.--Coasting the Range of Wareerat or Taseely.--Soudan\r\n     Species of Sheep.--Soudan Parrot.--The Lethel Tree.--The Tholh,\r\n     or Gum-Arabic Tree.--Falling of Rain in The Desert.--Oasis of\r\n     Serdalas.--My Companions of Travel.--Weather Hot and Sultry.--The\r\n     Slaves bear up well.--The Ship of The Desert.--Extremes of Cold\r\n     and Heat.--Mausoleum of Sidi Bou Salah.--Serdalas, a neglected\r\n     Oasis.--The Sybil of The Sahara.--Death and Burial of two Female\r\n     Slaves.--Dirge on the Death of one of them, whipped at the point\r\n     of Death.--Power of the Sun in Sahara.--Desert Mosques.\r\n\r\n\r\n_6th._--ROSE early, but did not start until the sun was well up, on\r\naccount of the slaves. These Nigritian people cannot bear the cold. Our\r\nnorthern cold affects them more than their southern heat does us. Heat\r\ncan be borne better than cold in Saharan travelling. Am glad to see that\r\nHaj Ibrahim has a large tent pitched for the greater part of the\r\nmiserable shivering things. It is made of rough tanned bullock skins, and\r\nholds the heat like a shut-up furnace. These tents are brought from\r\nSoudan, and after being used for slaves journeying over Sahara, are sold\r\nfor so much leather. Touaricks also use them in their districts. In\r\ntruth, Haj Ibrahim treats his slaves as much like a gentlemanly Moor as\r\nhe well can or could do, all their wants being attended to, and no\r\nfreedoms being taken with the young women. Their greatest hardship is to\r\nwalk, but after a night's rest, they partially recover. I may add, this\r\nis the best equipped caravan I could travel with, and, perhaps, hardly a\r\nfair specimen to judge of for ordinary slave-caravans. We continued our\r\nroute along the chain of mountains to the east, having, on our left, a\r\ncorresponding ridge of low sand hills. During the day, we traversed a\r\nbroad deep valley or wady, and, indeed, water had covered a good part of\r\nit in the early winter of this year. Here was abundant herbage, and\r\ncamels feeding belonging to the people of Ghat. There is also a well of\r\nwater out of the line of route on the left, about one and a half days'\r\nfrom Ghat, but having a good supply, it was not necessary to seek it. It\r\nis called _Tăsellam_. Here we met a hunter,--\r\n\r\n                            \"An African\r\n    That traverses our vast Numidian deserts\r\n    In quest of prey, and lives upon his bow\r\n    Coarse are his meals, the fortune of his chase;\r\n    He toils all day, and at th' approach of night,\r\n    On the first friendly bank he throws him down,\r\n    Or rests his head upon a rock till morn;\r\n    Then rises fresh, pursues his wonted game,\r\n    And if the following day he chance to find\r\n    A new repast, or an untasted spring,\r\n    Blesses his stars and thinks it a luxury.\"\r\n\r\nThe Targhee huntsman was clothed in skins, and was a genuine type of the\r\nhardships of open Desert life. The objects of his chase were gazelles and\r\nostriches, and the aoudad. His weapons were small spears and a matchlock.\r\nA most sorry-looking greyhound slunk along at his heels, the very\r\npersonification of ravening hunger.\r\n\r\n_Writer._--\"Targhee, where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n_Huntsman._--\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n_Writer._--\"Where have you been?\"\r\n\r\n_Huntsman._--\"Over the sand.\" (Pointing west.)\r\n\r\n_Writer._--\"Have you caught anything?\"\r\n\r\n_Huntsman._--\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n_Writer._--\"When do you drink?\"\r\n\r\n_Huntsman._--\"Now and then.\"\r\n\r\n_Writer._--\"Have you anything to eat?\"\r\n\r\n_Huntsman._--\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n_Writer._--\"When did you eat anything last?\"\r\n\r\n_Huntsman._--\"I forget.\"\r\n\r\nI threw him down from my camel some barley-bread and dates. He picked\r\nthem up, but said nothing, and went his way. Turning round to look after\r\nhim, I saw him cut across to the mountains on the east.\r\n\r\nObserved to-day some curious atmospheric phenomena. A light vapour, the\r\nlightest, airiest of the airiest, swept gently along the surface of the\r\nground, but as if unimpelled by any secret influence. It was also dead\r\ncalm. The vapour continued to sweep before us, till at length it suddenly\r\nrose up to the sky in the form of a spiral column of air, and then\r\ndisappeared. In this valley, which widened as we advanced, we once or\r\ntwice saw the mirage running along the ground like prostrate columns of\r\nfoam, striking out sparklings of light.\r\n\r\nTowards noon we had a full view of the celebrated Kesar Jenoun--\"Palace\r\nof Demons,\" to the west; in coming to Ghat we had it on the east. As we\r\nneared it, Haj Ibrahim said to me, \"Well, Yâkob, we must go and see the\r\ngreat Palace of Demons. We must see what it is, and you must write all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\nAt 4 o'clock P.M., we encamped right opposite its eastern side. On\r\nencamping, I looked about for Haj Ibrahim, and found him busy unpacking.\r\nI then very carelessly determined to start myself alone. I thought it,\r\nhowever, a good opportunity to show the people of the caravan that I was\r\nnot influenced by superstitious fears, and that, as an Englishman and a\r\nChristian, I cared little about their dreaded Palace of Demons. Haj Omer,\r\nthe merchant's servant, called out after me on starting, \"Be off, make\r\nhaste, you'll be back by sunset.\" I equipped myself with the spear and\r\ndagger of Shafou, and started off at a good pace, making a straight and\r\ndirect cut to The Palace. I scarcely noticed anything on the road going\r\nalong, staring with full face at the Huge Block of Mountain. But, on\r\ngetting out of sight of the encampment, and, under the shadow of this\r\n\"great rock in a weary land,\" I unaccountably felt the influence of those\r\nvery superstitious fears and terrors which I was so anxious to combat in\r\nmy fellow-travellers. I then soliloquized to myself, \"What a poor\r\ncreature is man, how weak, how miserable! how exposed to every whim and\r\nfolly which a credulous mind can invent!\" Thus soliloquizing, I got\r\nwithin the mysterious precincts of the Great Mountain Rock, in the course\r\nof three-quarters of an hour. I had, however, still more fear of the\r\nliving than the dead, and said to myself mechanically aloud, \"Man has\r\nmore to fear from the living than the dead;\" and I looked around\r\nanxiously this way, and that way, and every way, if perchance there might\r\nlurk, as the demon of the mountain, some stray bandit. Reassuring myself,\r\nmy thoughts turned on science. I wished to astonish the boobies of the\r\nBritish Museum by geological specimens from the far-famed palace of\r\nmortal and immortal spirits, built in the heart of The Great Desert. I\r\npicked up various pieces of stone which lay scattered at its rocky base.\r\nBut I found nothing but calcareous marl, or basaltic chippings and\r\ncrumblings, some of cream colour, some lavender, some purple, some\r\nred-brown, some nearly black. This done, as connoisseur of geology, I\r\nstood stock still and gaped open-mouthed like an idiot, at the huge\r\npyramidal ribs of The Rock. Then I bethought me I would ascend some of\r\nthese offshoots of the mountain, and take a quiet seat of observation\r\nfrom off one of the battlemental turrets which capped its many-towered\r\nheights, over all the subjected desert and lesser hills and rocks below.\r\nBut I soon changed my mind; not recognizing any decided advantage in\r\nscrambling up--God knows where--over heaps upon heaps of crumbling\r\nfalling rock. I now turned my back to the Demons' Cavern, without having\r\nhad the honour or pleasure of making a single acquaintance amongst these\r\ndemi-immortals, much to my regret, and my face was towards the\r\nencampment. At least I thought so. I saw at once that the king of day was\r\nfast going down to sup on the other side of The Palace, or perhaps with\r\nthe Demons, and I must hasten back to my supper. I started on my return\r\nas carelessly as I came, with this foolish difference, that, although not\r\nremarking a single part of my way hither, I fancied I would take a\r\nshorter cut back to supper, beginning to feel hungry, having eaten\r\nnothing since morning. In fact, I soon got into another track upon this\r\nabsurd idea of shortening the route. I recommend my successors in Saharan\r\ntravel, never to try short-cuts in unknown places. In ten minutes I made\r\nsure of my encampment, and ran right up to some mounds of sand topped\r\nwith bushes, where I expected to find Said with the supper already\r\ncooked, and the nagah lying snugly by, eating her dates and barley. But\r\nthat was not the encampment. The sun was now gone, and following hard\r\nupon his heels were lurid fleecy clouds of red, the last attendants of\r\nhis daily march through the desert heavens. I now looked a little\r\nfarther, and said to myself, \"There they are!\" I went to \"There they\r\nare,\" and found no encampment. I continued still farther, and said, \"Ah,\r\nthere they are!\" and went to \"Ah, there they are!\" and found no\r\nencampment. I now made a turn to the south, and saw them quietly encamped\r\nunder \"various mounds,\" and went to \"various mounds,\" but the encampment\r\nsunk under the earth, for they \"were not.\" All was right, and \"never\r\nmind,\" I should soon see their fires, and was extremely glad to notice\r\nall the light of day quenched in the paling light of a rising crescent,\r\nsome five or six days old. I thus continued cheerfully my search another\r\nquarter of an hour, when all at once, as if struck by an electric shock,\r\nit flashed across my mind, \"Peradventure, I might be lost for the night!\"\r\nand be obliged to make my bed in Open Desert. I have seen in my life-time\r\npeople strike a dead wall, as a convenient butt against which to vent\r\ntheir ill-disguised rage. I now must have a victim for my vexation. It\r\nwas not wanting. I felt something heavy and dragging in my pocket. The\r\nhalf hour's running about had reminded me of some until now unnoticed\r\nheavy weight, and this was the stones, and these were my grand specimens\r\nof geology. I quietly took out all the stones from my pocket, and threw\r\nthem deliberately but savagely away, certainly a very proper punishment\r\nfor leading me such \"a wild-goose chase,\" such \"a dance,\" over The\r\nDesert. In my wrath I was not disheartened. Now, as it was dark, I began\r\nto ascend the highest mounds of Desert, from, whose top I might descry\r\nthe fires of our encampment. I wandered round and round, and on, now\r\nover, sand and sand-hills, now climbed up trees, now upon eminences of\r\nsand or earth-banks, seeking the highest mounds of the vast plain, to see\r\nif any lights were visible, looking earnestly every way. No light showed\r\nitself as a beacon to the lost Desert traveller--no sound saluted his ear\r\nwith the welcome cry, \"Here we are!\" Felt so weary that I was now obliged\r\nto lie down to rest a little. But soon refreshed, I determined to return\r\nto The Palace, and find the place which I had visited. The fear and\r\nthought of being lost in The Desert now mastered every other\r\nconsideration, and I started unappalled to the Black Rock, without ever\r\nthinking of the myriads of spirits which at the time were keeping their\r\nmidnight revels within its mysterious caverns. Got near The Rock, but I\r\nsaw no place which I had seen before. The mountain had now at night\r\nassumed other shapes, other forms, other colours. Probably the demons\r\nwere dancing all over it, or fluttering round it like clouds of bats and\r\ncrows, preventing me from seeing its real shape and proportions. Be it as\r\nit may, I could not recognize the place which I had so recently visited.\r\nI now climbed up some detached pieces of rock to look for lights. I\r\nsprang up with the elastic step of the roe, over huge broken fragments of\r\nrock, aided by a sort of supernatural strength, the stones rolling down\r\nand smashing with strange noises as I was springing over them. From these\r\ncrumbling heights I looked eastward, and every way, but no friendly\r\nlight, watch-fire, or supper-fire, was visible. I descended, much heated,\r\nin a flowing perspiration, feeling also the cold chill of the higher\r\natmosphere. I began to have thirst, the worst enemy of the Saharan\r\ntraveller, and fatigue was violently attacking me. I considered (which\r\nafterwards I found quite correct) I had got too far north. I could not\r\nrecognize at all the processes of detached rock over which I had been\r\nscrambling. I must be several miles too high up. I went down along the\r\nsides of the Immense Rock, looking at every new shape it assumed to find\r\nthe place where so quietly I picked up the stones and geologized a few\r\nhours before. All was vain. Fatigue was overpowering me, and my senses\r\nbegan to reel like a drunken man. Now was the time to see the visions and\r\nmysteries of this dread abode, and unconsciously to utter sounds of\r\nunknown tongues. Now, indeed, I fancied I heard people call me; now I saw\r\nlights; now I saw a camel with a person mounted in search of me, to whom\r\nI called. And, what is strange, these sights and sounds were all about\r\nthe natural and not the supernatural. For instance, I did not see the\r\nvisage of a grinning goblin just within a little chink of The Rock, as I\r\nought to have seen. I did not see \"faëry elves\" dancing in the moonlit\r\nbeams, as I ought to have seen. Then boldly I took a direct course from\r\nthe mountain over the plain, believing I should intercept our encampment.\r\nI continued this line for two hours, or not quite so much, but I found\r\nmyself a long way east over the plain, where was neither camel, nor\r\nencampment, nor object, nor light, nor any moving thing. I then proceeded\r\nnorth, thinking I had got too far south again. Here I found a group of\r\nsand-hills, a new region, in which I painfully wandered and wandered up\r\nand down. I knew the encampment could not be here. To get clear of this\r\nhorrible predicament, I made another set at the Palace Rock, as if to\r\nimplore the mercy and forgiveness of the Genii. In an hour I found myself\r\nagain under its dark shadows. I walked up and down by its doleful dismal\r\nsides, thinking if any people were sent in pursuit of me I might find\r\nthem. All was the silence of the dead--no form flitted by except those\r\nwhich filled my disturbed imagination. I once more returned eastward to\r\nthe plain, but my head was now swimming, my legs shrank from under me,\r\nand I fell exhausted upon the sand. There I lay some time to rest. My\r\nbrain, hot and bewildered, was crowded with all sorts of fancies, but my\r\ncourage did not sink. I was seeing every moment people in pursuit of me.\r\nI heard them repeatedly call \"Yâkob.\" Somewhat composed, I determined\r\nupon giving up the search of the encampment till day-light, and went\r\nabout to find a tree under which to sleep, if I could. I went to one, but\r\ndid not like it, being low and straggling on the ground, exposed to the\r\nfirst chance intruder. I sought another, which I had before observed, for\r\nin this state I was forced to pick out the objects of the plain. I found\r\nmy tree, which in passing before by it I thought would make me a good\r\nbed. I could not find the encampment, but the tree observed before, I\r\ncould find. It was placed on a very high mound of earth, which was\r\ncovered with a large bushy lethel-tree. Happy tree! I have always loved\r\nthy name since. Under this I crept, but finding the top of the mound of a\r\nsugar-loaf form, I scooped out on its sides, digging away with my hands\r\nearth and dried leaves, a long narrow cell, literally a grave,\r\ndetermining, if I should perish hereabouts, this should be my grave. I\r\nfound it very snug, for the wind now got up east, and moaned in the\r\nlethel-tree above my head. I drove the spear in the earth, near \"the\r\nbolster,\" and took off the dagger from my arm. Had on my cloak, which I\r\nrolled fast round me, and got warm.\r\n\r\nThe midnight wind increased its doleful notes and heavy moans. Now a\r\ngruff piping of a cracked barrelled organ, and now, a wild shriek of one\r\ncrying in distress.\r\n\r\n    \"Mournfully! Oh! mournfully,\r\n      This midnight wind doth sigh,\r\n    Like some sweet plaintive melody,\r\n      Of ages long gone by.\r\n\r\n    \"It speaks a tale of other years--\r\n      Of hopes that bloomed to die--\r\n    Of sunny smiles that set in tears,\r\n      And loves that mouldering lie!\r\n\r\n    \"Mournfully! Oh! mournfully,\r\n      This midnight wind doth moan;\r\n    It stirs some chord of memory,\r\n      In each dull heavy tone.\r\n\r\n    \"The voices of the much-loved dead,\r\n      Seen floating thereupon--\r\n    All, all my fond heart cherished\r\n      Ere death had made it lone.\"\r\n\r\nMy first object was to lie and rest my senses, so that I should recover a\r\nlittle of my bodily strength, as well as have my thoughts about me. Of\r\nwild beasts I could not be afraid; I knew there were none. Of the wilder\r\nanimals still, the Desert bandits, I also had every reason to believe\r\nthere were none. But, from my elevated position, I could see their\r\napproach, or that of friends, nearly all around me. My only fear was to\r\nperish of thirst, for it attacked me now severely. Thus I lay for an hour\r\nor so, and then got up to watch the objects of Desert. All things were\r\ndeformed in the shadowy moonlight, and most things looked double with the\r\nreeling of my poor senses. Several times I imagined I saw a camel coming,\r\nactually passing by a few paces from the base of the mound. Frightened at\r\nthese illusions of the brain, I determined to try to sleep; my thirst\r\nstill increased and prevented me. As fatigue left me, my head became\r\nclearer, and more serious thoughts occupied the mind. The moon, however,\r\nI watched, wheeling her \"pale course,\" for I knew she finished now her\r\nshadowy reign a few hours before morning. It is impossible to give any\r\noutline of the thoughts which now rapidly and in wild succession passed\r\nmy mind: suffice to say, I committed my spirit to the Creator who gave\r\nit. I repeated mechanically to myself aloud, \"Weeping may endure for the\r\nnight, but joy cometh in the morning.\" I now took the bold resolution to\r\nreturn to Ghat, not wasting my strength in the morning, after having made\r\na short search in The Desert. It was the only chance of saving my life,\r\nif I could not at once find the encampment. This resolution kept up the\r\nstrength of my mind, and prevented me from sinking into despair. I had\r\nnothing to eat, nor drink, but I might reach Ghat in the evening of the\r\nsecond day, or if strong enough, I might get back in one long day. I knew\r\nthe route along the line of Wareerat, and could not possibly lose myself\r\nwhen I was only to pursue the camel-track at the base of this mountain\r\nrange. The only difficulty was, lest I should turn to the right and get\r\nentangled amongst the sand-hills and dwarf wood, before I reached the\r\nturning of the road which would conduct me direct to Ghat. Things which\r\nhave made an impression in childhood, the soonest recur to the mind in\r\nthese distressing cases. I thought of poor Hagar with her Ishmael,\r\nexposed to perish with thirst in The Desert: it was exactly my case,\r\nwhilst dim vistas of childhood now filled up the chasms of opening\r\nmemory. Byron's dying gladiator, in the last struggles of death, saw the\r\ngreen banks of the Rhine, the flowery scenes of his childhood's days,\r\nand, amid the horrid din of the Roman amphitheatre, heard the innocent\r\nshouts of his little playmates. I was now suffering a dreadful thirst,\r\nand might perish unless the same Providence directed me to the well, or\r\nthe encampment, as guided the wretched handmaiden of Sarah.\r\n\r\nWithin seven or eight miles from the place where I now lay, I recollected\r\nthere was the well Tasellam, under the shadow of The Rock. But how to\r\nfind it, when I could not find the encampment lying still nearer me! Then\r\ncame lesser thoughts and vexations. What was I to do in Ghat? How get\r\nback even if I escaped with my life in my teeth to the oasis? And would\r\nnot the first thing, on my escape, be an attack of fever? Then recurred\r\nto me the words of my friend Fletcher, \"Expose yourself to no unnecessary\r\nrisks.\" The strongest self-condemnation stung me, I was vexed at my\r\nextreme folly. Shall I add, that my thoughts wandered far over The\r\nDesert, skimmed over the surge of the Mediterranean, and ascended on the\r\nwing of the east wind, now cooling my burning forehead, and sought some\r\nsad solace in dear objects of my fatherland. Oh! the heart shrinks from\r\nrevealing to the world its secret thoughts, its sorrowful regrets, its\r\nbitter self-reproaches! I must be silent of the rest. I now got up, sleep\r\nI could not. I was rejoiced to see a blacker shade thrown upon all\r\nnight-visible things. The moon had performed her nocturnal duty,\r\nsubmissive and obedient to the law imposed upon her by universal nature,\r\nand had also sunk back, like the sun, below the Giant Demon Rock. I then\r\nlay down again, and just before day, after a few moments of broken sleep,\r\nfor I even slept and forgot my perilous plight, another time I came out\r\nof my living grave to make observations. I looked at the eastern and\r\nwestern horizons, and thought the eastern was the lighter of the two, and\r\nthere was the false dawn, or the dawn itself. I had often watched these\r\ndawns in the route from Tripoli to Ghadames, and grew wise in\r\ninterpreting nocturnal sights and signs by dire experience. I lay down\r\nonce more. Half an hour past, I came again and the last time forth, for\r\nall the east was now inflamed with the breaking out of day. The wheels of\r\nthe sun's chariot were of radiant light vermilion, the horses, of darting\r\norient flame, were being yoked on, and I stood silent and sad to see \"the\r\ngreat king of day\" mount, and commence his diurnal course. The Rock of\r\nDemons repelled the light, and shrouded itself in deeper gloom, as Desert\r\nmorn advanced,\r\n\r\n    \"And sow'd the earth with orient pearl;\"\r\n\r\nfor even in the dry Desert the morning sheds some moisture, if not\r\ndew-drops. But on that Rock my thoughts now concentrated--there I must\r\nsoon return, and revisit all its dark and rugged precincts. This was my\r\nonly chance to meet with any persons sent in pursuit of me, if such there\r\nwere. Began to see I had wandered at least eight miles from the Huge\r\nRock. I threw my mantle over my shoulders, put the dagger under my left\r\narm, and took the lance in my right hand, which felt heavy, for I had\r\nbecome weak and weary with the past night's traverse of The Desert, and\r\nthe painful vigils afterwards. Descending from the mound to the level of\r\nthe plain, I looked back upon my bed and grave, as if loth to leave it.\r\nAs soon as there was light enough to see objects somewhat distinctly, I\r\nprayed to God for deliverance, and sallied forth with an unshrinking\r\nmind. I was amazed at the illusions of The Desert, for it was now day;\r\nthe night might have its deceptions and phantasmagoria. Every tuft of\r\ngrass, every bush, every little mound of earth, shaped itself into a\r\ncamel, a man, a sheep, a something living and moving. Before the day was\r\nhardly begun, I sprang over again to the base of the Rocky Palace, and\r\nsaw now the detached pieces which during the night I had ascended; but,\r\nfor the life of me, I could not find the place I visited first, and made\r\ngeological discoveries, never, never to be divulged. I continued to pace\r\nup and down, north and south, for an hour, until weariness began anew to\r\nattack me. I sighed and said to myself aloud, \"So soon tired!\" I now\r\nreturned to the plain and made another straight cut. Although the day was\r\npretty well developed I was staggered at the deceptions and phantasms of\r\nThe Desert. Every moment a camel loomed in sight, which was no camel.\r\nThere was also a hideous sameness! the reason, indeed, I was lost. For\r\nthere were no distinguishing marks, the mounds followed shrubs, the\r\nshrubs mounds, then a little plain, then sand, then again the mounds and\r\nshrubs, plain and sand, and always the same--an eternal sameness! Now\r\nfalling into the track of a caravan, I was determined to pursue it, but\r\nit was with great difficulty I could follow out the traces. For at long\r\nintervals the hard ground received no impressions of men or camels' feet,\r\nand I repeatedly lost the track, going a hundred or more yards before I\r\ncould get into it again, I continued north, I saw the camels' feet, the\r\nsheep's feet, and the prints of the camel-drivers, and sometimes I\r\nthought I saw my own foot-marks. But the slaves! Where were the\r\nimpressions of the naked feet of some fifty slaves? Now I groaned with\r\nthe anguish of disappointment. I must abandon the track in despair. I had\r\nalready pursued it painfully over sand and rock, and pebbles, and shrubs,\r\nand every sort of Desert ground.\r\n\r\nAll this was fast wasting away my little remaining strength. I now\r\nmounted two very high mounds. Nothing lived or moved but myself in the\r\nunbroken silence, the undisturbed solitude! I observed my being too far\r\nnorth, I must return south. Another camel appeared. Yes, it was a small\r\nblack bush, on the top of a little hillock, shaping itself into a camel.\r\nNow a marvel--life I was sure I saw. Two beautiful antelopes, light as\r\nair, bounded by me with amazing agility, and were lost in a moment\r\namongst the shrubs and mounds of the desert plain. I fell to musing on\r\nnatural history, and accounted for these gazelles by the presence of the\r\nwell. I then recollected the Targhee hunter. For an instant I forgot my\r\nsituation. But where was I? What was I doing? Was I to return to Ghat,\r\nor perish in The Desert? My strength was failing me fast. I could not\r\npursue for ever this wild chase at the base of the rock of the Jenoun.\r\nUnder their baleful influence, I shall wander and wander till I drop and\r\nperish! I must make up my mind. The sun was not yet high up. I could walk\r\ntill noon on the journey back, and then sleep a few hours and rest. The\r\nchill of the morning had taken away my thirst. I wrapped a handkerchief\r\nover my month, and took all the precaution I could against the\r\napproaching thirst at noon-day. The lance was heavy. Shall I throw it\r\naway? Could it not afford me a moment's protection in meeting a single\r\nbandit, which class of men mostly go alone? I keep my lance, but\r\ndetermine to sit down to rest, previous to departing for Ghat. I had\r\noften noticed the Arabs make a straight cut of route by raising up the\r\nright arm, and putting under it the left hand to support it, and then\r\nwaving up and down the right and left arms together. After my short rest,\r\nI mimicked them. Mimickry is instinctive in us. I singled out for myself\r\na distant hill on the plain, lying south in the route by which we had\r\ncome here. Now then, I took the first step towards Ghat. I continued an\r\nhour, but oh! how weary I had become. Nature seemed ready to sink, and I\r\ndropped suddenly on the side of a small sand-mound....... What shall I\r\ndo?..... Shall I shed tears to relieve me?..... No, I have long given up\r\nshedding tears. And, now! I must keep up at the peril of my life. My\r\nheart renews its courage. I again get up and begin to walk, limping\r\nalong. The small hill was before me--but should I ever reach even\r\nthat?..... My strength of body was now gone, though the mind would not\r\nyield...... In the last moment of human extremity ...... death\r\nitself ..... comes deliverance! I continue my route to Ghat. I have just\r\nstrength to raise my lance from the sand it pierces. I turn an instant\r\nround to the right hand, and a white figure passes by...... What is that?\r\nA friend or an enemy? I continue on. Is this one of our people, or of\r\nstrangers? Shall I take him for a guide? Before I can think of it, I espy\r\nsomething in advance. But I fear an illusion, another deception. No! it\r\nis the head of a camel! I spring on with my little remaining staggering\r\nstrength. To my joy unspeakable, I find myself upon my own camel--my own\r\nlittle encampment! But what a strange, a ludicrous scene! Here is poor\r\nSaid skulking by the supper of the previous night, still placed on the\r\nfire, but which is gone out, his hands covering his face, and his head\r\nhanging down, his eyes swollen with tears but staring on the sand. The\r\ncamel looks restless about, and moans. I cry out--\"Said!\" He starts up as\r\nif from a death-trance. He bellows out--\"Aye wah,\" and begins to sob\r\naloud. The slaves, close by, hear the noise and rush upon us. Where are\r\nthe people? I see only slaves. They are all gone towards The Rock in\r\npursuit of me. I now lie down and they bring me something to drink[96]. I\r\nbegin with a little cold tea, and then eat a few dates. Afterwards, we\r\ngot the supper cooked the previous night heated. About a quarter of an\r\nhour elapsed, when some of the party returned, and then the rest from the\r\npursuit. They had gone as soon as it was light this morning. Last night\r\nsome of them had been after me, and traced my steps, wandering over the\r\nsand, round and round, till they were nearly lost themselves, and got\r\nback to the encampment with difficulty. As soon as I recovered a little\r\nrest, our people came up to me and began to joke and laugh. \"Ten\r\ndollars,\" said one, \"you must give us for the trouble we have had in\r\nseeking for you.\" Another said, \"Lay down, Yâkob, sleep, we will wait\r\ntill noon before we start, to enable you to rest.\" It was now 9, A.M. But\r\nthe greater number of our party seemed confused, not knowing what to\r\nthink or say. In my absence, the general impression was that I had been\r\nkilled by the demons. Some, more sober, thought I might have fallen into\r\nthe hands of the Touaricks. Now they said: \"You were very foolish, you\r\nought not, as a Christian, to have presumed to go to the Palace of the\r\nDemons, without a Mussulman, who could have the meanwhile prayed to God\r\nto preserve you, and likewise himself. The demons it is who have made you\r\nwander all night through The Desert.\" The Medina Shereef, who was of our\r\nparty, boldly asserted, \"The palace is full of gold and diamonds. The\r\nGenii guard it. No wonder then they were offended with your going, and\r\nstruck you as a madman so that you could not return.\" Others asked me\r\nwhat I saw, but would not believe me when I told them I saw nothing. So\r\nit came to pass, that I nearly lost my life for the sake of confirming\r\nthem more strongly than ever in their superstitions. I, who was to have\r\ntaught them the folly of their fears by practical and demonstrable\r\ndefiance of the Genii confirmed and sealed the power of the Genii over\r\nthis Desert. But I must observe, my companions of travel did not adopt\r\nthe right method of rescuing me from the malignant influence of the\r\nGenii. If they had sent a man in each direction from the camp, I should\r\nsoon have been found. All going in one direction to The Mountain, the\r\nother routes were entirely unexplored. If ever I travel The Desert again,\r\nI shall provide myself with a pocket-compass, and something still better,\r\na small tin or other box, of sufficient size to hold about a quarter of a\r\npound of crushed dates, or other concentrated food, and a small bottle of\r\nspirits and water. The compass to be always in my pocket, and the box\r\nalways tied round my neck night and day. In the case now narrated, with\r\nthis little stock of provisions I could have got safe back to Ghat, and\r\nwaited and rested on the road. As it happened, there was every\r\nprobability I should have perished, if I had not found the encampment. I\r\ncontinued for a full hour to drink ghusub-water and tea, with a few\r\ndates. Then I ate more solid food, and took coffee. My mind now\r\nrebounded, and the joy of deliverance seemed as if it would\r\ncounterbalance the dreadful anxieties of the past night. What a pure\r\npleasure I now tasted a few moments! In a freak, I sat down and sketched\r\nThe Demons' Palace, laughing defiance upon it all the while, with the\r\nwayward self-will and harmless spite of a child, I took this vengeance on\r\nthe unlucky Black Rock.\r\n\r\nNow all was passed, I fancied I had merely experienced a distempered\r\ndream and ugly vision of The Desert. But when I rose to mount my camel, I\r\nfound it had been no vision--I was obliged to be lifted upon my camel.\r\nLittle did I think during the last (to me ever memorable) night, while\r\nchasing wearily about the dreary Desert, my own countrymen had before\r\nvisited the same identical Demons' Rock. I had heard, indeed, some of the\r\npeople say it had been \"written by Christians.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to Dr. Oudney, and hear what he says about The Rock. On\r\nan excursion westward, from Mourzuk to Ghat, they arrived near Ludinat,\r\nin the valley of Serdalas or Sardalis. At a small conical hill called\r\nBoukra, or \"father of the foot,\" the people of the caravans amused\r\nthemselves by hopping over it; he who does it best is considered least\r\nexhausted by the journey. Near this are a few hills, among which a\r\nserpent, as large as a camel, is said to reside. \"The Targhee is\r\nsuperstitious and credulous in the extreme: every hill and cave has\r\nsomething fabulous connected with it.\"\r\n\r\nOf the nature of the mountains hereabouts, the Doctor says, \"We entered\r\n(after leaving Serdalas) a narrow pass, with lofty rugged hills on each\r\nside; some were peaked. The black colour of almost all, with white\r\nstreaks, gave them a sombre appearance. The external surface of this\r\nsandstone soon acquires a shining black, like basalt; so much so, that I\r\nhave several times been deceived, till I took up the specimen. The white\r\npart is from a shining white aluminous schistus, that separates into\r\nminute flakes like snow. The ground had in many places the appearance of\r\nbeing covered with snow.\"\r\n\r\nThey now got on the plain of the Kesar Jenoun. The hills of Tradart or\r\nWareerat (apparently the same word, but sometimes called Taseely) now\r\nappeared on the east, and the high sands on the west. \"The Tradart (or\r\nTaseely) range,\" says Oudney, \"has a most singular appearance; there is\r\nmore of the picturesque in this than in any hills we have ever seen. Let\r\nany one imagine ruinous cathedrals and castles; these we had in every\r\nposition, and of every form. (I myself often thought of Windsor Castle,\r\nand the many hoary-headed old castles of England.) It will not be\r\nastonishing that an ignorant and superstitious people should associate\r\nthese with something supernatural. That is the fact; some particular\r\ndemon inhabits each. The cause of the appearance is the geological\r\nstructure. In the distance there is a hill more picturesque and higher\r\nthan the others, called Gassur Janoun, or Devil's Castle. Between it and\r\nthe range there is a pass[97] through which our course lies. Hateetah\r\ndreads this hill, and has told me many strange stories of wonderful\r\nsights having been seen; these he firmly believes, and is struck with\r\nhorror, when we tell him we will visit it.\"\r\n\r\nOur countrymen kept the range of Wareerat the whole day, and were amazed\r\nwith the great variety of forms. And when Clapperton thought he perceived\r\nthe smell of smoke the previous night, Hateetah immediately said it was\r\nfrom the Devil's House. Another smaller rock is called the Chest, under\r\nwhich a large sum of money is said to have been deposited by an ancient\r\npeople who were giants of extraordinary stature. The present race of\r\nTouaricks are, indeed, giants compared to some of our pigmy European\r\nnations. Oudney made an excursion to Janoun, the Kesar Jenoun. He says,\r\n\"Our servant Abdullah accompanied me. He kept at a respectable distance\r\nbehind. When near the hill, he said, in a pitiful tone, 'There is no road\r\nup.' I told him we would endeavour to find one. The ascent was\r\nexceedingly difficult, and so strewed with stones, that we were only able\r\nto ascend one of the eminences; there we halted, and found it would be\r\nimpossible to go higher, as beyond where we were was a precipice.\" It\r\nwould appear the Doctor ascended one of the detached blocks, which I\r\nascended last night to observe the fires of the encampment. Hateetah got\r\nalarmed at the departure of Oudney, and Clapperton was not able to allay\r\nhis fears: he was only soothed when the Doctor returned. The Sheikh was\r\nastonished, as much as our people, when the Doctor said he had \"seen\r\nnothing.\" How like things happen! Even at the distance of twenty long\r\nyears, between my visit and the Doctor's, it seems as if I was narrating\r\none story. The Doctor was also mainly incited by the same feeling as\r\nmyself, to observe the geological structure. He observes, \"The\r\ngeological structure is the same as the range (Wareerat) that is near.\"\r\nTo-day, after twenty years, and without knowing what the Doctor had\r\nwritten, when I made the same observation to our people, and tried to\r\npersuade Haj Ibrahim, the most intelligent of my companions, that there\r\nwas nothing in this huge block different from the mountain range near it,\r\nbeing of the same stone and consistence, he replied drily, looking at\r\nboth formations, \"Yâkob, it's not true. You see on the Kesar Jenoun the\r\nvery stones which the Demons have built up like the Castle at Tripoli.\r\nWhen you will be blind, how can you see? Why not believe in our Genii?\"\r\n\r\nThis leads me to notice the Mahometan belief in Demons or Genii.\r\nAccording to the best commentators, the term ‮جنّ‬ \"_Jinn_\"\r\nsignifies a rational and invisible being, whether angel or devil, or\r\nthe intermediate species called \"genius\" or \"demon.\" As the word\r\nGenii is used in the passage of the Koran, \"Yet they have set up the\r\nGenii as partners with God, although he created them,\" (Surat VI.)\r\nsome believe it refers to \"the angels whom the Pagan Arabs\r\nworshipped, and others the devils, either because they became their\r\nservants, by adoring idols at their instigation, or else because,\r\naccording to the Magian system, they looked upon the devil as a sort\r\nof creator, making him the author and principal of all evil, and God\r\nthe author of good only.\" We all know what a share the Genii have in\r\nworking the wonderful machinery of the Arabian Nights Tales. The\r\nTouaricks give them still greater powers, and make them a sort of\r\ndelegated or deputy creators, according to the Magian system, but\r\ndo not attribute to them the malevolent passions of an evil being.\r\nThey are probably influenced by the Koran in this, which in the\r\nSurat, entitled \"The Genii\" (lxxii.) makes a portion of them to have\r\nbeen converted by hearing the reading of the Koran: \"Say, it hath\r\nbeen revealed unto me, that a company of Genii heard me reading the\r\nKoran, and said, Verily we have heard an admirable discourse, which\r\ndirecteth into the right institution; wherefore we believe therein,\r\nand we will by no means associate any other with our Lord.\" The\r\nancient Pagan Arabians also believed that the Genii haunted desert\r\nplaces, and they frequently retired, under cover of the evening's\r\nshade, to commune with these familiars of The Desert.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, worth while to compare this Desert Pandemonium, which the\r\nimagination of the Touaricks has built up amongst their native hills,\r\naided by the light of the Koran, with what the creative mind of Milton\r\nhas constructed by the aid of the learning of his times, and our own\r\nScriptures. The difference is as striking as contrast can present. But\r\nyet there are some wonderful affinities, showing that mind is one and the\r\nsame amongst barbarian or civilized nations. Blackness and darkness enter\r\ninto the situation of both pandemoniums. The Desert Pandemonium has its\r\npillars and turrets, its frieze, bas-reliefs, and cornices of ornamental\r\narchitecture, though all done by the hand of \"geological structure,\"--its\r\ndark colours shining with \"a glossy scurf.\" The Desert Pandemonium is\r\nalso alive with myriads of spirits, peopling its subterranean vaults. The\r\nDesert Pandemonium has finally its riches, its jewels, and its\r\ntreasures, such as Mammon, \"the least-erected spirit,\" discovered and\r\n\"led them on\" to, in the deeps of hell. We may now transcribe the\r\ndescription of Milton's Pandemonium, the great ingredient of contrast\r\nbeing light and splendour amidst the \"darkness visible\" of the regions of\r\nperdition.\r\n\r\n    \"Anon, out of the earth a fabric huge\r\n    Rose like an exhalation, with the sound\r\n    Of dulcet symphonies, and voices sweet,\r\n    Built like a temple, where pilasters round\r\n    Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid\r\n    With golden architrave; nor did there want\r\n    Cornice or frieze, with bossy sculptures graven;\r\n    The roof was fretted gold.\"\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        \"The ascending pile\r\n    Stood fix'd her stately height; and straight the doors\r\n    Opening their brazen folds, discover, wide\r\n    Within, her ample spaces, o'er the smooth\r\n    And level pavement; from the arched roof\r\n    Pendant by subtle magic, many a row\r\n    Of starry lamps and blazing crezzets, fed\r\n    With naphtha and asphaltus, yielded light\r\n    As from a sky.\"\r\n\r\n_7th._--From the Kesar Jenoun, and indeed before arriving there, the\r\nvalley assumed the form of a boundless plain, widening during the whole\r\nof our march to-day. We had still on our right, the chain of Wareerat,\r\nand, on our left, but scarcely visible, the low ridge of sand hills. We\r\nfrequently find this sort of Desert geological phenomena; a range of\r\nrocky hills or mountains has a parallel range of sand hills, and the\r\nintermediate space is a broad valley or vast plain. In traversing this\r\nvalley-plain, covered now with coarse herbage, now sand, now mounds of\r\nearth, now pebbles, now quite bare, our progress was precisely like that\r\nof a ship sailing near the shore, with bluff rocks and headlands jutting\r\nand stretching into the sea. So were we on our Desert ships (the camels)\r\ncoasting slowly but surely along; whilst the mountains and their varied\r\nmagic shapes continually mocked our weary efforts, and our strained\r\nvision; now appearing near, then distant, again near, again distant, and\r\never changing their wild, fantastic forms. I thought we passed the tree\r\nunder which I made my grave-bed of the past night, but here were many\r\nmounds and many dark lethel-trees crowning the many mounds. The detached\r\nrocks I did see, and recognized fully my error, but which I had\r\nconjectured, in wandering so far northwards. Our people observed justly,\r\n\"Yâkob, we all went to find you, for we wished all equally to bear the\r\nresponsibility. If you had been lost, who knows but what we should have\r\nbeen all blamed for having put you away, or left you behind?\" This is,\r\nperhaps, but too true a conjecture. These poor people would have,\r\nperhaps, not only been blamed for my death, but accused of it. I was glad\r\nfor their sakes, as well as my own, that I escaped from a Desert death.\r\nThe story of the visiting the Palace of Demons would have been told, of\r\ncourse, variously by so many different people. How could they tell the\r\nstory in the same way! These varieties of evidence would have been\r\nconsidered unsatisfactory, if not conclusive against them, whilst some\r\npeople, suspicious of the Moors, would have believed the whole was a\r\n\"cunningly-devised\" trumped-up invention. The deaths of Park and Laing\r\nmay have been unjustly charged upon the Africans in this way. How, and\r\nfor what they died, is now altogether beyond our investigation. Even the\r\nmore recent death or assassination of Davidson is a mystery of The\r\nDesert. We encamped close by a little stunted herbage, on which the\r\ncamels scantily fed. Weary with the previous night's adventure,\r\nimmediately on being lifted off the camel, I fell down fast asleep upon\r\nthe ground. Our course to-day due north.\r\n\r\n_8th._--Did not rise until the sun was wheeling his daily course high up\r\nthe heavens. Felt better, and walked a little in the morning. No symptoms\r\nof fever from the former night's exposure. In general the open Desert is\r\nperfectly salubrious. It is in the oases, mostly situated in the valleys,\r\nwhere the fever is generated. The Demon Temple still in view, with all\r\nits mysterious hideousness, crowned with its grisly towers. It now stands\r\nout in all its defiant isolation; the sand hills which broke upon its\r\nview, running north and south, are now seen far beyond. It is its\r\ndetached condition from the neighbouring chain of Wareerat, with which\r\nits geological structure is indissolubly connected, that has given this\r\nhuge pile its supernatural reputation. The Demons' Rock is apparently a\r\nhuge square, having four faces, and requiring a day to make the tour of\r\nits rugged and jutting basements. Its highest turret-peaks may be some\r\nsix or seven hundred feet. The wady now has disappeared,--all is an\r\nimmeasurable expanse of plain, and bare as barrenness and barren wastes\r\ncan be. I observed a peculiar mirage to-day--lakes of still black shining\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nA part of our caravan, and not the least interesting, are six Soudan\r\nsheep, which belong to Haj Ibrahim. Their species is well known, but I\r\nmust mention what an agile and strong animal is the Aheer and Housa\r\nsheep, being brought from both countries. This Soudan sheep is the best\r\nwalker in the whole caravan, and the last which feels fatigue or drops\r\nfrom exhaustion. He browses herbage as the camel on the way, nibbling all\r\nthe choicest herbs, and sometimes strays at a great distance from the\r\ncaravan. He has had forty days' training from Aheer, and, as a slave\r\nsaid, \"He's a better pedestrian than the mahry.\" He is an attacking\r\nanimal, not scrupling even to attack the hand which feeds him with a\r\nlittle barley. He is so formidable to the sheep of the Barbary Coast,\r\nthat I have seen a whole flock scamper away at the simple sight of him.\r\nHe is tall, his legs long, and his limbs generally better proportioned\r\nthan the common sheep. As he requires no wool to shelter him from cold in\r\nthe sultry regions of Central Africa, Providence has only given him a\r\ncoat of hair; and his tail is like that of the common dog. The head\r\noffers nothing remarkable, but his look is bold, and his heart\r\ncourageous. He butts fiercely at all strangers, and he is the only lord\r\nof freedom whilst marching over The Desert. In the companionship of these\r\nsheep over The Desert, they acquire a strong affection for one another,\r\nand I saw at Ghat two separated from a flock with great difficulty, the\r\nwhole flock pursuing savagely the man who had taken away from them two of\r\ntheir _compagnons de voyage_. In going over Desert they require little\r\nattention, and will go without water for half a dozen days together.\r\nWhen, however, we come to a well, they are the first that will be served,\r\nneither sticks nor blows will keep them off. We have also, as travelling\r\ncompanions, ten or twelve parrots of the common blue-grey Soudan breed.\r\nThis parrot has a white broad rim round the eye; its body is a light\r\ngreyish-blue, legs, beak, and claws black, under-tail feathers white and\r\nupper scarlet. Each two or three of the parrots have a little round house\r\nto themselves, about eight inches in diameter, made of skins, and pierced\r\nwith holes to let in the air and light, besides a door. Their quarrels\r\nare frequent, for quarrelling seems an essential part of the nature of\r\nall animals, the rational and irrational, and they often fight\r\ndesperately, and are obliged to be separated. They are carried on the\r\nheads of the slaves, being, as these poor people, the purchased luxuries\r\nof the rich. The parrots are allowed to have an airing and a walk morning\r\nand evening. They all talk in good grammatical Negro language, and can\r\noccasionally aid our researches in Nigritian tongues. Parrots are brought\r\nfrom as far as Noufee.\r\n\r\nThe wood in the valley we just left, is the Lethel. Its leaves are\r\npowdered over with a white saline substance, indeed, why not salt itself?\r\nSome of these trees are very large, having very thick trunks and boughs,\r\nperhaps forty feet high, and ten feet round the thickest trunks, which\r\nwood, when palm-wood is scarce, is used instead for building. On the\r\nplain, however, the Tholh[98] began to appear. This tree is found, as\r\nnoticed before, in the most desolate places of The Desolate Sahara. It is\r\nsometimes very large for trees here, perhaps thirty feet high, and six or\r\nseven of width round its broadest trunks. The camels browse on it\r\nalways, and when hungry crop with avidity a great quantity of the\r\nprickles and thorns, and thorny leaves. It is a mystery to me how the\r\ncamel can chew such thorns in its delicate mouth. The Koran mentions the\r\ntholh (Surat lvi.), as one of the trees of Paradise, which Sale has\r\ntranslated Mauz, \"the trees of mauz loaded regularly with their produce\r\nfrom top to bottom.\" But tholh here seems to refer to a very tall and\r\nthorny tree, which bears an abundance of beautiful flowers of an\r\nagreeable odour, one of the many species of acacia, and not the ordinary\r\ngum-arabic tree.\r\n\r\nNear sun-set we left the plain, and I took an everlasting farewell of the\r\nTemple of Genii. Poor inanimate Rock! which should so much bewilder man's\r\ncrazy brain, and fill the desert travellers with such strange fancies. We\r\nturned to the north-west into a gorge of the chain of Wareerat. In this\r\ngorge, besides the usual black sandstone, with glossy basaltic forms,\r\nwere large deposits of chalk, one of which our route intersected, on the\r\ntop of the ridge, where also the action of water was extremely well\r\nmarked. The action of water remains a long time visible in The Great\r\nDesert, perhaps twelve, twenty, nay, fifty years, during which several\r\nperiods, even in the driest regions of The Sahara, there is sure to be a\r\nheavy drenching rain,--an overflowing, overwhelming mass of water falls\r\non the desert lands. The districts of Ghat remained some eight or ten\r\nyears without an abundant rain, till this last winter, when it came in\r\nmost overpowering showers[99]. The action of rain on the earthy bosom of\r\nThe Desert is very much like that of the action of the sea on its shores,\r\nwhich has led to the remark, that The Sahara looks as if it been \"washed\r\nover\" by the ocean. The mounds of earth so frequently met with in The\r\nDesert are formed by water in the time of great rains. In this gorge were\r\nbig blocks of stone, on which were carved Touarghee characters. It was\r\nfortunate I knew the characters, for the people wished to persuade me\r\nthey were those of very ancient people, and of Christians, whilst none of\r\nthe party could read them. They are probably the names of shepherd and\r\nTouarghee camel-drivers, wandering through Desert. Some of the letters\r\nhave a very broad square Hebrew or Ethiopic look about them. The gorge\r\nwas steep, narrow, and intricate in the first part of its ascent. We then\r\ndescended and encamped between the links of the chains, which form so\r\nmany valleys, some broad and deep. It was a good while after sun-set,\r\nwhen we brought up for the night, and we had come a very long day. All\r\nwere greatly fatigued, especially the poor slave girls.\r\n\r\n_9th._--Rose early, and started early. The feet-marks of the aoudad wore\r\nobserved on the sand. Course through the gorge north-east. After a couple\r\nof hours we cleared the gorge, entering upon a broad open plain or\r\nvalley. Here I observed the chain of Wareerat was rounded off on the\r\neastern side, and of considerably less altitude, whilst the peaks of the\r\nopposite or western side were steep and escarpé, owing apparently to the\r\naction of the water in the wady.\r\n\r\nContinuing our course on the plain for an hour or two, we arrived at\r\nthe oasis of Serdalas, a handful of cultivation, but very fair and\r\nof vigorous growth. The valley or plain of Serdalas, which is also\r\ncalled Ludinat, and the site of a Marabet, is an extensive\r\nundulating plain, bounded east and west by two ranges of mountains,\r\nstretching north and south. Near the spot of our encampment are\r\nwells of excellent water, seven or eight of them, and the largest is\r\na thermal spring, which is about the centre of the oasis. It is\r\nbanked up, or rather issues from a rocky eminence, where large lumps\r\nof bog iron may be picked up. Formerly this spring was fortified,\r\nthe high walls built around its mouth still remaining, and there are\r\nbesides the brick ruins of a castle close by. Tradition relates that\r\nthe oasis was formerly colonized by Christians, and others say, by\r\nJews. It may, indeed, have been colonized previously to the arrival\r\nof the Arabs in Africa by the ancient Berbers, or Numidians, but the\r\ncastle itself is of Moorish modern construction. The present\r\nmiserable population does not exceed ten persons, Fezzaneers and one\r\nor two Touaricks, who cultivate a little wheat and ghusub. The\r\nhouses are huts of sticks, date-leaves, and dried grass. Near the\r\ngreat spring is a large tree, with prickly thorny leaves, not unlike\r\nthe tholh. It is called _Ahatas_, ‮اهتس‬, and was brought from\r\nSoudan, where its species grows to an enormous magnitude. Its wood\r\nmakes excellent bowls, spoons, and several useful domestic\r\nutensils. This tree measures at least twelve feet round its trunk;\r\nits principal branch is prostrate, bent beneath the burden of many a\r\nSaharan summer's heat and winter's cold. From the old paralyzed arm,\r\nhowever, shoot up young green branches, offering a pleasant shade to\r\nthe weary and thirsty wayfarer in these wilds. Under this tree money\r\nis buried to a great amount, but the writings, pointing out the\r\nparticular spot, were destroyed by a son of the Marabout, whose tomb\r\nconsecrates this desert spot. Several small birds are hopping about,\r\nlike those seen in Ghat, with white heads and white under tails, the\r\nrest black. This seems a _bonâ fide_ feathered tenant of Sahara.\r\n\r\nWe remain here to-day and to-morrow. It is, perhaps, for the better, for\r\nwe are all knocked up. By preserving the body we preserve the mind. Our\r\nparty consists of four merchants, the rest being servants and slaves. My\r\nfriend Haj Ibrahim is the principal one. We have the Medina Shereef, who\r\nis in charge of a male and two female slaves, the property of the\r\nGovernor of Ghat. He continues his route from Tripoli to Mecca, and\r\nexpects to be absent two years on his pilgrimage. The Shereef makes great\r\npretensions to learning and sanctity, and I believe he is clever, if not\r\nlearned; he says to me, \"My business is study and prayer.\" He asked me\r\nabout Khanouhen, his father-in-law, and the presents which I made the\r\nprince, and said, \"Khanouhen sent back his presents to you, and would not\r\naccept them.\" I told him I commuted the goods into silver; at which he\r\nlaughed and remarked, \"Ah! Khanouhen is deeper than the devil himself.\"\r\nHe considers Jabour's protection omnipotent in the route of Timbuctoo,\r\nbut says the Touaricks only, and not caravans, can protect European\r\ntravellers: I think the Shereef is right. Another of our merchants is a\r\nvery civil Ghadamsee, and acts as a sort of broker for Haj Ibrahim. He is\r\nvery civil and good-natured, but, nevertheless, keeps mostly in his hand\r\na little nasty whip, with which he lays it into the unlucky slaves. The\r\nlast of the four is a queer dwarfish Touatee, from Aïn Salah, who is\r\ncarrying a few little bags of gold to Tripoli, perhaps a dozen ounces. At\r\nthe instigation of the Shereef, who likes a laugh, I keep roasting him on\r\nthe way, telling him, \"You have got so much gold about you that we are\r\nsure to be attacked by banditti before we arrive safely at Tripoli.\" This\r\nmakes him very savage, and sometimes he calls me a kafer. Haj Omer is the\r\ngreat factotum of Haj Ibrahim, an Arab of Tripoli, and a most hardy\r\nhard-working fellow. Omer has two camels which are hired by his master.\r\nOne of these foaled a little before we left Ghat, and he carried the\r\nyoung camel the half of a day's journey on his back. Omer never rides,\r\nwalks all day long, pitches the tents, looks after the camels, looks\r\nafter the slaves, and from morning to night is on his legs. So these\r\npeople can work when it is necessary; indeed, I am sure, with a good\r\ngovernment, and an equitable system of trade, the Moors and Arabs of\r\nNorth Africa would be as industrious and persevering as any other people.\r\n\r\nIt is now afternoon, and very hot. The weather has been sultry the four\r\ndays of our route. But our faces are nearly always north, and a slight\r\nfresh breeze blows from either N., N.E., or N.W. every day, a most\r\ngrateful relief. It is, however, cold at nights, and very cold in the\r\nmorning after the heat has been absorbed during the night. The negresses\r\nare busy either pounding ghusub, or washing themselves, or making the\r\ntoilet and arranging their sable persons in showy trinkets. Certainly\r\nwoman in the negro races is a remarkable creature. She bears her bondage\r\nand its hardships with consummate fortitude, and the greatest good humour\r\nand gaiety, never quarrelling or sulking with her master, and only now\r\nand then having a little bickering of jealousy or rivalry with her fellow\r\nslave. Two or three slaves only, for the present, are unable to keep up,\r\nand placed on the backs of camels. I am astonished to see how well they\r\nkeep up, what fatigue they are capable of bearing; I should myself die of\r\nexhaustion were I placed in their situation. There is a little boy only\r\nfour or five years of age, who walks as well as any of them. He refused\r\nmy offer to give him a ride, and answered, \"I don't wish to ride. I\r\nwalked all the way from my native country to Ghat.\" Should this little\r\ncreature continue to walk his way to Tripoli, by the time he arrives in\r\nthat city he will have walked over eighty-five days of Desert, besides\r\nthe distance he may have walked before reaching Aheer, perhaps some\r\nadditional thirty days.\r\n\r\nAnother of Haj Ibrahim's camels foaled to-day. The foal is stretched upon\r\nthe ground as if lifeless, the mother standing over and staring at it.\r\nBut the foal will not remain so long, for to-morrow or next day it will\r\nbe up on its legs, and after four, five, or six days, it will be able to\r\nrun after its dam. In fact, the foal, now five days' old, runs after its\r\nmother part of the day's march, and after two or three more days it will\r\nbe able to continue a whole day's journey. Here is an instance of the\r\nimmense superiority of the lower animal over the higher animal man. It is\r\ncurious that the cry of the foal is very much like a child, and I once\r\nturned round to see a negress child crying, and found it was a\r\ncamel-foal. In marching the foal is tied upon the back of its mother, and\r\nso borne along, the dam grumbling regular choruses to the cry of the\r\nfoal. (_Later an hour._) The foal is actually upon its legs, about four\r\nhours after its birth, and it has sucked its mother twice. The mother\r\ndoes not quarrel so much about her child as the first she-camel. Such is\r\nthe varying dispositions of brutes. A foal is worth ten dollars when a\r\nyear old. Most she-camels have a foal every other year, but some few\r\nevery year. The foal remains a whole year with its mother. None of these\r\ncamels give milk, because there is not sufficient herbage in our way. In\r\ncases of extremity, when the herbage is scarce and the camels give little\r\nmilk, the Touaricks of Ghat will drive their camels to graze as far as\r\nAheer, or even to Soudan. Milk is an essential portion of their means of\r\nexistence. The reader must not be surprised to find so frequent a mention\r\nof the Camel-Ship of The Desert. In the Koran the camel is thus\r\nintroduced, \"Do not they consider the camels, how they are created?\"\r\n(Surat Lxxxviii.) and very properly, as a wonderful instance of the\r\ncreative might of Deity. These animals are of such use, or rather\r\nnecessity, in The East and in The Desert, that the creation of a species\r\nso wonderfully adapted to these countries, is a very apposite and proper\r\ninstance to an Arabian and African, or even an European (travelling\r\nhere), of the power and wisdom of the Creator. Like the reindeer, and the\r\nlichen, or moss, on which it feeds in the polar regions, the camel and\r\nthe date-palms in the Great Desert furnish striking and remarkable\r\nexamples of the inseparable connexion of certain animals and plants with\r\nhuman society and the propagation of our common species. Providence, or\r\nnature, for it is the same, has so formed the faithful, patient and\r\nenduring camel, as to create in this animal a link of social and\r\ncommercial intercourse amongst widely-scattered and otherwise apparently\r\nunapproachable nations. The she-camel which I am riding through these\r\nsolitary wastes never fails me, except from sheer exhaustion, the\r\nenduring creature never giving in whilst nature sustains her! In the most\r\narid, herbless, plantless, treeless, thirsty wastes, she finds her\r\nloved-home, for The Desert is the natural sphere of life and action for\r\nthe camel. The Desert was made for the Camel, and the Camel was made for\r\nThe Desert.\r\n\r\n_10th._--Did not sleep very well, and felt very cold during the night.\r\nBut as soon as the sun is up it is hot. Such is The Desert. It is also\r\ncold in the shade, and hot in the sun. When riding, a hot wind burns the\r\none cheek, and a cold wind blanches the other cheek[100]. You wander\r\nthrough these extremes like the spirits of the nethermost regions,--\r\n\r\n    \"And feel by turns the bitter change\r\n    Of fierce extremes, extremes by change more fierce:\r\n    From beds of raging fire, to starve in ice--\r\n    Thence hurried back to fire.\"\r\n\r\nI usually am obliged to wear my cloak out of the sun, besides a woollen\r\nburnouse.\r\n\r\nVisited the marabet, or mausoleum, of Sidi Bou Salah, about two hundred\r\npaces from the large spring. My Fezzanee guide told me the daughter of\r\nthe buried Marabout was still living in the oasis, but his sons were\r\nresiding in Fezzan. When the corn was reaped, late in the spring, he\r\nhimself should return to Fezzan. One or two persons would remain here.\r\nThe tomb of the Marabout is enclosed within the usual square little\r\nhouse, having a dome or cupola roof, but it is not clean whitewashed, as\r\nthese sanctuaries generally are on the Coast. On the tomb is a coverlet\r\nof particoloured and showy silks. The room of the mausoleum is snug and\r\nclean. A little lamp is kept burning at the head during the night. This\r\nis a sort of perpetual fire. There are two or three outhouses, or rooms,\r\nadjoining, in which, if anything be deposited, it is quite safe, it is\r\nsacred, no robbers in these wild countries being bold enough to commit\r\nsuch a sacrilege against the God of the Islamites. The entire oasis is\r\npeculiarly protected by the halo of the awful Marabout here buried. It is\r\na place of perfect security for all travellers. In this way the sentiment\r\nof religion confers its advantages, whatever may be the creed of its\r\nprofessors. No doubt the sentiment of religion, as connected with\r\nsuperstition, inflicts upon mankind intolerable evils; but here, at any\r\nrate, is some compensation.\r\n\r\nI surveyed again the great thermal spring. The water issues from a rocky\r\nferruginous soil of iron ore, giving the water a mineral taste. Yet it is\r\nof the best quality. Apparently the water descends from the neighbouring\r\nmountain chains, and collects here, but its flow or stream is perennial.\r\nFrom this little eminence I had a panoramic view of the country, and was\r\ngratefully affected with the beautiful situation of the oasis. In the\r\nhands of Europeans, a city would be created here, one of the largest of\r\nThe Great Desert, for water abounds on every side. This oasis would\r\nbecome the centre of a dense population, fed from the products of the\r\nsoil. A mart of commerce would concentrate a great Saharan traffic,\r\nramifying through every part of Africa. But what can be expected from\r\npeople whose one predominant and _quasi_-religious idea teaches them that\r\neverything should remain as it is; as it was before so shall it be\r\nhereafter. People nevertheless pretend that political causes keep the\r\noasis in its present miserable condition. Serdalas belongs to the\r\nTouaricks, who let it out to the Fezzaneers, but will not permit them to\r\nplant date-palms, lest the oasis should flourish and rival Ghat, and so\r\ninjure that mart of commerce. Be it as it may, man always fails of his\r\nwork, and if he does so in the more genial climes of Europe, what can\r\ncome of his idleness and his improvidence in The Vast African Desert?\r\nDesolate as The Sahara may be in its essential character, it is rendered\r\nstill more so by the neglect of its heedless and dreamy tenants. Many are\r\nthe oases in this neglected, abandoned state. And the saddening,\r\nsickening thought often recurs to me, that, however desolate The Sahara\r\nmay have been in past ages, it is now getting worse instead of better.\r\nGhadames, and many oases of Fezzan, are dwindling away to nothing, the\r\npopulation lessening, and dispersing under the curse of the Turkish\r\nsystem!\r\n\r\nFezzan is only reckoned five days from Serdalas, good travelling, but,\r\nwith a caravan of slaves, it will occupy us six or seven days. How fond\r\nof lying are the Moors, or, shall we say, boasting? The Shereef, I hear\r\nfrom my other companions, is not going on a pilgrimage to Mecca, as he\r\nboasted to me. He merely goes to Tripoli on a trip to sell his three\r\nslaves for the Governor, his uncle, and purchase a little merchandise in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nHad a visit from the daughter of the Marabout, the wild Sybil of The\r\nDesert. She is an Arab lady of some seventy or more years of age, but,\r\nlike most ladies, does not know how old she is. At first sight of her, I\r\n\r\n    \"Gaz'd on her sun-burnt face with silent awe,\r\n    Her tatter'd mantle,\r\n    Her moving lips,--\r\n\r\n    \"Whose dark eyes flash'd, through locks\r\n    of blackest shade.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pythoness asked me how I liked her country, a hundred times, and then\r\nbegged for something in the name of Allah. She kept saying, \"What have\r\nyou got for the daughter of the great Marabout?\" \"What have you got for\r\nher who dedicates her life to God?\" She was very proud of the\r\ndistinction, _Bent-El-Marabout_ (\"daughter of the Marabout\"). And why\r\nshould she not be proud? When all comes to all, the Saharan lady is as\r\ngood as a Roman Nepote of the Pope. She continued, \"What have you got for\r\nthe daughter of the great Marabout?\" And, indeed, I had got very little.\r\nI then gave her a little looking-glass, the only one I had. But this is\r\nno privation in The Desert, however necessary elsewhere. The\r\nlooking-glass exceedingly delighted the sybil, for in it she saw the\r\nstern features of her face, with her dauntless eye. She then got\r\nfamiliar. She wondered why I was not married, and how I could go to\r\nsleep without a wife. She prayed me to take one from Fezzan, or buy a\r\nnegress of the caravan, telling the people, \"The Christian is very good,\r\nbut very foolish. The Christian has plenty of money, and does not buy a\r\nwife.\" I told her it was prohibited to buy slaves. And as to a wife, I\r\ncould not carry her about in The Desert. To which she at length, after\r\nmuch persuasion, consented to agree. The daughter of the Marabout showed\r\nno hostility against me as a Christian, although of such pure blood, and\r\nin which the antagonism of the eastern to the western spirit is supposed\r\nto be stronger. She gave me her blessing, and we parted friends. The only\r\npiece of dress of any kind which the Maraboutess wore was a thick, dark,\r\nwoollen frock, with short sleeves. She had no ornaments; her hair was\r\nblack, mixed with grey, long, and dishevelled about her neck and\r\nshoulders. An air of the Pythoness overshadows the countenance and\r\ncarriage of this Desert priestess. Amongst the people she is a holy\r\nbeing. She lives alone. She has the power of foretelling future events.\r\nShe receives small presents from all the ghafalahs which visit the oasis,\r\nas tithes of the Marabout shrine. She never leaves this Desert spot. Her\r\nperson was ever inviolable. It is related that, many years ago, an Arab\r\nonce attempted to surprise her in the night, and share a part of her bed,\r\nbut was immediately struck dead before he could stretch out his hand to\r\nopen the door of her grass-built hut. So The Desert has its incorruptible\r\nvestals. But the conversation which her ladyship had with me was all\r\npro-matrimonial, and would not have suggested to the stranger that she\r\nwas an ancient maiden of inviolate chastity. Perhaps she might have\r\nthought this sort of conversation would please me best. The Maraboutess,\r\nas well as the few Fezzaneers in Serdalas, are of short stature, of a\r\nvery dark-brown complexion, approaching nearly to black, and some have\r\nthe broad distended nostrils of the negro. The Shereef said to me this\r\nafternoon, \"I'm going to pray at the Marabout shrine; I go happily, I\r\nreturn happily.\" Our Shereef is a little self-righteous.\r\n\r\nEvening, died a young female slave. She had been ill a month. She was of\r\nthe most delicate frame, and cost seventy dollars as a great beauty. She\r\nwas buried in the grave-yard of the Marabet without any ceremonies. Happy\r\ncreature to have so died. They first tried to dig a grave in open desert,\r\nbut not succeeding, they carried her to the burial-ground of the Marabet.\r\n\r\n_11th._--To-day is the fourteenth day of the month, and Wednesday instead\r\nof Monday, by the reckoning of my fellow travellers. A fine morning, but\r\nwe all felt severe cold during the past night, and which nipped up the\r\npoor slaves.\r\n\r\nThis morning visited Haj Ibrahim early, and seeing a young female very\r\nill I remarked: \"You had better leave her with the daughter of the\r\nMarabout.\" He replied, much agitated, \"Oh, no, it's a she-devil.\"\r\nThinking she might be sulky, as Negroes often sulk, I made no other\r\nobservation. A few minutes after I heard the noise of whipping, and\r\nturning round, to my great surprise, I saw the Haj beating her not very\r\nmercifully. He had a whip of bull's hide with which he gave her several\r\nlashes. This displeased me much, for I thought if the girl had sulked a\r\nlittle she might have been cured without recourse to the whip, in her\r\ndebilitated state. About a quarter of an hour afterwards, or not so much,\r\nI saw Haj Omer, servant of the Haj, going towards the graveyard, with a\r\nsmall ax in his hand, and suspecting something had happened, I followed\r\nto see what it was. On arriving at the Marabet, I asked,\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dig a grave, only,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" I continued, \"are you going to dig the grave of the Negress whom\r\nHaj Ibrahim was just now beating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Omer returned, greatly ashamed.\r\n\r\nI was not surprised at the answer, but a disagreeable chill came over me.\r\nOmer then added apologetically, \"They bring these poor creatures by\r\nforce, they steal them. They give them nothing to eat but hasheesh\r\n(herbs). Her stomach is swollen. We couldn't cure her; Haj Ibrahim beat\r\nher to cure her. She had diarrhœa.\" This requires no comment. I add only,\r\nif Haj Ibrahim, who is a good master, can treat his slaves thus, what may\r\nwe not expect from others less humane? There is no doubt but that the\r\nwhipping of this poor creature hastened her death. She was, indeed,\r\nwhipped at the point of death. I stopped to see the lacerated slave\r\nburied. She was some eleven years of age, and of frailest form. A grave\r\nwas dug for her about fifteen inches deep and ten wide. It is fortunate\r\nthere are no hyenas or chacalls to scratch up these bodies. They do \"rest\r\nin peace.\" Into this narrow crib of earth she was thrust down, resting on\r\nher right side, with her head towards the south, and her face towards the\r\neast, or towards Mecca. She had on a small chemise, and her head and\r\nfeet and loins were wrapped round with a frock of tattered black Soudan\r\ncotton. Omer, before he put her in, felt her breast to see if she were\r\nreally dead. At first he seemed to doubt it, and fancied he felt her\r\nheart beating, but at last he made up his mind that she was really dead.\r\nI felt her hands. They were deathly cold. At times Moors bury people\r\nwarm, and not unfrequently alive. They are always in a desperate hurry to\r\nget corpses under ground, thinking the soul cannot have any peace whilst\r\nthe body lies unburied. As the last service to the body, Omer took some\r\nearth and stopped up her nostrils. This was done to prevent her reviving\r\nshould she be not really dead, and attempt to move. Unquestionably if\r\nburied in the open desert, it is a service, for the wretch only revives\r\nto die a more horrible death. Some small flag-stones were then laid over\r\nthe narrow cell, and these were covered with earth, in the form of a\r\ncommon grave, being only a little narrower than our graves, as the body\r\nis turned up on its side. The two poor young things lay side by side, the\r\none who died yesterday, and the one to-day, giving their liberated\r\nspirits opportunity to return to the loved land of freedom, the wild\r\nwoods of the Niger. Happy beings were they;--better to die so in The\r\nDesert, in the morning of their bondage, than live to minister to the\r\ncorrupt appetites of the unfeeling sensualist! Seeing others, free\r\npeople, with pieces of stone raised up at their heads, and wishing the\r\nslave and the free to have equal rights in the grave, I fetched two\r\npieces of stone and placed them at their heads likewise. If it be\r\npermitted to pray for the dead, God save, in mercy, these two youthful,\r\nfrail, but almost sinless souls!\r\n\r\nDIRGE[101].\r\n\r\n    \"O'er her toil-wither'd limbs sickly languors were shed,\r\n    And the dark mists of death on her eyelids were spread;\r\n    Before her last sufferings how glad did she bend,\r\n    For the strong arm of death was the arm of a friend.\r\n\r\n    \"Against the hot breezes hard struggled her breast,\r\n    Slow, slow beat her heart, as she hastened to rest;\r\n    No more shall sharp anguish her faint bosom rend,\r\n    For the strong arm of death was the arm of a friend.\r\n\r\n    \"No more shall she sink in the deep scorching air,\r\n    No more shall keen hunger her weak body tear;\r\n    No more on her limbs shall swift lashes descend,\r\n    For the strong arm of death was the arm of a friend.\r\n\r\n    \"Ye ruffians! who tore her from all she held dear,\r\n    Who mock'd at her wailings and smil'd at her tear;\r\n    Now, now she'll escape, every suffering shall end,\r\n    For the strong arm of death was the arm of a friend.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to the encampment and found the caravan in motion.\r\nBurning hot to-day. I felt the heat as oppressive as in my journey\r\nof August to Ghadames. Fortunately our faces were north-east, away\r\nfrom the sun in its greatest power. No one can understand this\r\npassage, καὶ ἡ ὄψις αὐτοῦ ὡς ὁ ἥλιος φαίνει ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ,\r\n(Rev. i. 16,) who has not travelled under the influence of the\r\nSaharan sun. The rays dart down with a peculiar fierceness upon your\r\ndevoted head, depriving you of all your life-springs. As to its\r\nsplendour, the eye of the eagle turns away daunted from its\r\nall-effulgent beams. Since leaving Ghat we have passed many graves\r\nof the \"bond and the free,\" who have died in open desert. Passed one\r\nto-day, with Arabic characters carved on the stone raised at its\r\nhead. Passed by also several desert mosques, which are simply the\r\noutline in small stones, of the ground-plan of Mahometan temples.\r\n\r\nWe have, in many instances, only the floor of the mosque marked out, or\r\nrather the walls which inclose the floor. Within the outlines the stones\r\nare nicely cleared away. Here the devout passers-by occasionally stop and\r\npray. The desert mosques are some of them of these shapes--\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe places projecting in squares or recesses are the kiblah, upon which\r\nthe Faithful prostrate themselves towards the east, or Mecca[102].\r\n\r\nOur course is through an undulating country of hills and valleys. We made\r\na short day, for we began to fear we might lose many of the slaves. A\r\nTouarghee caravan, going to Fezzan, overtook us _en route_, but soon\r\nturned off to the north-west.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] I hope I offered up a heartfelt prayer of thankfulness to the\r\n    Almighty for my deliverance from perishing in The Desert.\r\n\r\n[97] It is a very wide valley, nay an extensive plain. But the\r\n    Doctor writes about it before he arrives there.\r\n\r\n[98] Tholh--‮الظلح‬--_Acacia gummifera_, (Willd.) It bears what\r\n    the Moors and Arabs call _Smug Elârab_ (‮صمغ العرب‬),\r\n    or \"Gum Arabic.\" This is the most hardy tree of The Desert, and,\r\n    like the karub-trees of Malta, strikes its roots into the very stones.\r\n\r\n[99] Dr. Oudney says, who was a man of science:--\"Rain sometimes\r\n    falls in the valley (of Sherkee, Fezzan,) sufficient to overflow\r\n    the surface and form mountain torrents. But it has no regular\r\n    periods, five, eight, and nine years frequently intervening\r\n    between each time. Thus, no trust can be placed in the occurrence\r\n    of rain, and no application made in agricultural concerns.\" In\r\n    truth, the rain which falls in these uncertain intervals, seems to\r\n    answer no available purpose, unless to feed the wells and\r\n    under-currents of water.\r\n\r\n[100] The blowing hot and cold with the same breath is here a\r\n    reality, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n[101] Adapted from an anonymous piece, called \"_The Dying Negro_.\"\r\n\r\n[102] \"But we will cause thee to turn towards a _Kiblah_ that will\r\n    please thee. Turn, therefore, thy face towards the holy temple of\r\n    Mecca; and wherever ye be, turn your faces towards that\r\n    place.\"--_Surat_ ii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nFROM GHAT TO MOURZUK.\r\n\r\n     Another Range of Black Mountains.--Habits of She-Camels when\r\n     having Foals.--Our Mahrys.--Intelligence of my Nagah.--Geology of\r\n     Route.--Arrive at the Boundaries of Ghat and Fezzan.--The\r\n     Moon-Stroke.--Sudden Tempest.--Theological Controversy of The\r\n     Shereef.--Wars and Razzias between the Tibboos and\r\n     Touaricks.--Forests of Tholh Trees.--The Shereef's opinion of the\r\n     Touaricks.--Dine with The Shereef.--Saharan Travellers badly\r\n     clothed and fed.--Style of making Bazeen.--Mode of\r\n     Encamping.--Cold Day, felt by all the Caravan.--Well of\r\n     Teenabunda.--Arrival in The Wady of Fezzan.--Meeting of the two\r\n     Slave Caravans.--Tombs of Ancient Christians.--Routes between\r\n     Ghat and Fezzan.--Weariness of Saharan Travel.--Oases and Palms\r\n     of The Wady.--We meet a rude Sheikh, demanding Custom-Dues.--Haj\r\n     Ibrahim's opinion of the Virgin Mary.--Black Jews in Central\r\n     Africa.--My Affray with the Egyptian.--Route to Tripoli, _viâ_\r\n     Shaty and Mizdah.--Features and Colour of Fezzaneers.--My Journey\r\n     from The Wady to Mourzuk, on leaving the Slave-Caravans.--Tombs\r\n     of former Inhabitants, and Legends about them.--Bleak and Black\r\n     Plateau.--The Targhee Scout.--Have a Bilious Attack.--Desert\r\n     Arcadians, and lone Shepherdesses.--Oasis of Agath, and its want\r\n     of Hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_12th._--A LONG, long, weary day, and tormentingly hot in the middle of\r\nthe day. Course north-east, over plains scattered with small stones.\r\nTraversed a few small ridges of hills. A new species of stone to-day, the\r\nhard slate-coloured, and some of it with a granite-like look. Afternoon,\r\ncame in sight of the other chain of black, or, as sometimes designated,\r\nSoudan mountains, stretching boundlessly north and south, like those\r\nnear Ghat. This chain likewise extends to the Tibboo country. It is an\r\nerror of some of the late French writers, to make the Saharan ranges\r\nalways run east and west. This direction of development only applies to\r\nthe Atlas ranges of the Coast. No trees, and no herbage for the camels.\r\nThe hasheesh which the camels ate this evening was brought us from the\r\nencampment of yesterday. The poor slaves knocked up to-day; rested many\r\ntimes on the road, and another very ill. In all probability she will\r\nfollow her companions lately dead. Others, however, sang and danced, and\r\ntried to forget their slavery and hardships. But the death of the two\r\ngirls is a damper for the rest, and they have not been so merry since\r\nthat mournful occurrence. The she-camels, which have foals, give no milk\r\nfor want of herbage. The two mothers bite one another's children. This,\r\nperhaps, they do to teach the young ones their true mothers. One of them\r\nmakes a great noise over her young one, and disturbs all the caravan.\r\nEvening, whilst all the people were at prayers, and prostrating in their\r\nusual parallel lines, I went up to her, and began teazing her. The angry\r\nbrute slowly and deliberately got up, but, once on her legs, she made a\r\ndead set at me, running after me. Meanwhile, receding backwards as fast\r\nas I could, I fell over some of the people praying and prostrating, and\r\nthe camel attacked them as well as me, spoiling their devotions. The\r\ncamel now returned to her foal; and, prayers over, Haj Ibrahim said to\r\nme, laughing, \"Yâkob, the camel knows you are a kafer, and don't pray\r\nwith us. So she attacks you. Camels never attack good Moslems at their\r\nprayers.\" The foal of seven days' old walked the whole of our long march\r\nto-day! and nearly as fast as a man. So the poor camel begins to learn\r\nby times its lessons of patience and long-suffering. The mahry of the Haj\r\nis very vicious and greedy, and bites all the other camels which eat with\r\nit. Camels are made to eat in a circle, all kneeling down, head to head,\r\nand eye to eye. Within this circle of heads is thrown the fodder. Each\r\ncamel claims its place and portion, eating that directly opposite to its\r\nhead. The people eat in the same manner in circles, each claiming the\r\nportion before them, but squatting on their hams instead of kneeling. The\r\nmahry of the Haj is quite white, and is a very fine animal; but its eye\r\nis small and sleepy-looking, so that it does not appear to have the\r\namount of intelligence of the Coast camels. We have another smaller\r\nmahry, and some of the mahrys are as diminutive as others are gigantic in\r\nsize. My nagah feeds by herself. The males never bite the females as they\r\nbite one another,--a piece of admirable gallantry, so far, on their part,\r\nbut they rob the females of their fodder, and I am obliged constantly to\r\nkeep driving them away from my nagah. The nagah knows she receives her\r\ndates from our panniers. Stooping down on one of them this evening to\r\nfind something, putting my head right in, and raising myself up, I found\r\nthe nagah's head right over my shoulder, attentively watching me, to see\r\nif I was bringing out her dates. She distinguishes me well from the Moors\r\nand Arabs, by my black cloak, and is usually very gentle and civil to me,\r\nand familiar, more especially about the time of bringing out the dates.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Our course north-east, over an undulating plain of sand and\r\ngravel, and at intervals the desert surface was a plain pavement of\r\nstone, of a dark slate-colour. Greater part of the route strewn with\r\npieces of petrified wood, but no pretty fossil remains. Wood, apparently\r\nchumps of the tholh. We had all day the new range of black mountains on\r\nour right, which extend southwards far beyond the Fezzanee country to the\r\nTibboos. Intensely cold all day, the air misty, and the wind from\r\nnorth-west. But I prefer this cold to the heat of yesterday. Haj Ibrahim\r\ncomplained of the cold, and was alarmed for his slaves. One of the\r\nfemales he chased on his mahry, the girl running away on foot, and gave\r\nher two or three cuts with the whip. She had been accused of too great\r\nfamiliarity with a male slave. Crime and slavery go hand in hand:\r\nMiserable humanity!\r\n\r\nAbout noon, we reached the territory of Fezzan. Good bye, Touaricks!\r\nfarewell to the land of the brave and the free! Farewell, ye Barbarians!\r\nwhere prisons, gibbets, murders, and assassinations are unheard of. We\r\nnow tread the soil of despotism, decapitations, slavery and civilization,\r\nunder the benign Ottoman rule, in conjunction with the Christianized\r\nPowers of Europe! The boundaries of Ghat and Fezzan are determined by two\r\nconspicuous objects, first, by a chain of mountains running north-east\r\nand south-west, joining the oases of Fezzan on the north, and extending\r\nto the Tibboo towns on the south, the eastern side of all which chain is\r\nclaimed by the masters of Fezzan, the western by the Touaricks of Ghat;\r\nand secondly the forests of tholh trees, which are now appearing in our\r\nnorth, affording abundant wood to the people of the caravan, and browsing\r\nfor the camels. I am now, then, once more under the power of the Porte,\r\nand within the region of Turkish civilization. Passed other desert\r\nmosques, with some Arabic characters written in the sand, near the\r\nKeblah.\r\n\r\nTo-night the moon shone with a sun's splendour; all our people seemed\r\nstartled at this prodigious effulgence of light. Several of the slaves\r\nran out amongst the tholh trees, and began to dance and kick up their\r\nheels as if possessed. It might remind them of the clear moonlit banks\r\nand woods of Niger. Haj Ibrahim at last got out his umbrella and put it\r\nup, \"What's that for?\" I asked. \"The moon is corrupt (fesed), its light\r\nwill give me fever. You must put up your broken umbrella.\" So said all\r\nour people, and related many stories of persons struck by the moon and\r\ndying instantaneously[103]. This is another illustration of the passage,\r\n\"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.\" (Ps. cxxi.\r\n6.) In the Scriptures are several allusions to a stroke of the sun, (see\r\nIs. xLix. 10, Rev. vii. 16,) but few to the moon-stroke. Saharan opinion\r\nis that the moon-stroke is fatal. I am not aware that the moon-stroke is\r\nwell authenticated by our eminent physicians. The writer of the psalm\r\nspoke the current language of his epoch of science. It is probable that\r\n\"moon-struck madness,\" and strokes of the moon, are the effects of\r\nnoisome or infectious vapours which crowd about the night, and obscure\r\nwith a still paler light that pale luminary. The sun-stroke seems to be\r\nwell-authenticated; many cases of Europeans going hunting and sporting in\r\nthe open country of Barbary, then and there receiving a stroke of the\r\nsun, and dying with fever, are on record.\r\n\r\n_14th._--Course as usual, north-east. Cold to-day. Skirt the\r\nmountain-chain on our right, and traverse a vast plain, scattered with\r\npebbles and other small stones. As yet, we have not passed over sands or\r\nthrough any sandy region, although sand-ranges bounded the west in the\r\nearly part of the route; here and there a little sand, loose and flying\r\nabout. Our road is a splendid carriage-road. Oh, were there but water!\r\nBut water is the all and everything in The Desert. Encamped on the\r\nlimitless plain. How variable is Saharan weather: now, at sunset, a\r\ntempest rises, and sweeps the bosom of The Desert with \"the besom of\r\ndestruction!\" A high wind continued all night. I fancied myself at sea,\r\nbut preferred the Ocean Desert, its groaning hurricane, its hideous\r\nbarrenness, to the heaving and roaring of the Ocean of Waters. We passed\r\nanother desert mosque; it was only a simple line, slightly curved for the\r\nKeblah. There were also some letters written on the earth, in Arabic,\r\npassages from the Koran. Other writing on the ground is always smoothed\r\nover, and not allowed to remain. Part of the road was covered with heaps\r\nof stone, as if done to clear it, as well as to direct travellers _en\r\nroute_.\r\n\r\nThe Shereef introduced the subject of religion to-night in conversation.\r\nHe observed:--\r\n\r\n\"The torments of the damned are like all the fires in the world put\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Are these torments eternal?\"\r\n\r\n_The Shereef._--\"Yes, as everlasting as Paradise.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"But do you not continually say, 'God is The Most Merciful.' How\r\ncan this be?\"\r\n\r\n_The Shereef._--\"I don't know, so it is decreed.\" The Shereef boldly\r\ncontinued, \"In this world[104] God has given all the infidels plenty of\r\ngood things, (this being a sly allusion to the Christians and their\r\npossession of great wealth); but, in the next world, the believers only\r\nwill enjoy good, and the kafer will be miserable.\" \"You, Yâkob,\" he\r\nproceeded, \"are near the truth, very near, and near Paradise, because you\r\ncan read and write Arabic, and understand our holy books.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on preaching me a very orthodox sermon. I asked him how\r\nGod would dispose of those who never read or heard of Mahomet or the\r\nKoran. He couldn't tell. The same queries and objections are,\r\nnevertheless, applicable to our own and to nearly all religions, which\r\nmake the condition of believing one thing, and one class of doctrines,\r\nabsolute for salvation. The Touatee gold-merchant, who was close by at\r\nthe time, interposed, \"You are near jinnah (Paradise), Yâkob, one word\r\nonly, 'There is no God but God, and Mahomet is the prophet of God.'\" I\r\nreturned, \"If this be not uttered from the heart it is useless and\r\nmockery.\" \"By G--d! you are right, Yâkob,\" exclaimed the Shereef. Like\r\nmost Mahometans, the Shereef says, \"The coming of Jesus is near, when he\r\nwill destroy all the enemies of God, Jews and Christians, and give the\r\nworld and its treasures into the hands of the Moslemites.\" I asked him\r\nwhy he represented all mankind but the Moslemites to be the enemies of\r\nGod? My mind always recoils from the thought of arranging mankind, and\r\nmarshalling them forward, so many enemies of God, as if the Eternal and\r\nAlmighty Being who planned, formed, and sustains the universal frame of\r\nnature, could have enemies! Man may be the enemy of his fellow man, but\r\ncannot be the enemy of God. The Shereef here did not know what to say,\r\nand I think replied very properly, _Allah Errahman Errahem_, \"God is most\r\nmerciful!\" a sentiment which all of us admit in spite of our peculiar\r\ndogmas of theology. But this conversation offers nothing new or different\r\nfrom those which I had with my taleb Ben Mousa, at Ghadames.\r\n\r\nThe Shereef then spoke about slavery, and asked me, why the English\r\nforced the Bey of Tunis to abolish the traffic in slaves. I explained the\r\ncircumstances, adding, the Bey was not forced, but only recommended, by\r\nthe English Government to abolish the slave traffic. He then began a long\r\nstory in palliation of the traffic, stating that the slaves knew not God,\r\nand that in being enslaved by the Mohammedans they were taught to know\r\nGod. I soon stopped his mouth, first, by telling him, the Turks not long\r\nago had enslaved the Arabs and sold them for slaves at Constantinople,\r\nand then, adding, \"Nearly all the princes, whence the Soudanese and\r\nBornouese slaves were brought, are professedly Mahometans, as well as\r\ntheir people.\" He acknowledged, however, slaves were mostly procured by\r\nbanditti hunting them, not captured in war. He finished, \"The Touaricks\r\nof Ghat formerly hunted for slaves in the Tibboo country, twice or thrice\r\nin the year, and in these razzia expeditions some would get a booty of\r\nthree, or five, six, ten, and twenty, according as they were fortunate.\r\nNow they have other business on hand, the war with the Shânbah. The\r\nTouaricks of Aheer, those who bring the senna, are now the great\r\nslave-hunters.\" The Shereef showed me a Tibboo youth seized by the Aheer\r\npeople. The Shereef's account of the Touarghee razzias in the Tibboo\r\ncountry is confirmed by the reports of our Bornou expedition, or rather\r\nthe Shereef confirms the reports of our countrymen. Dr. Oudney says, \"It\r\nis along these hills (the ranges which go as far as the Tibboo country)\r\nthe Touaricks make their grassies (razzias) into the Tibboo country.\r\nThese two nations are almost always at war, and reciprocally annoy each\r\nother by predatory warfare, stealing camels, slaves, &c., killing only\r\nwhen resistance is made, and never making prisoners.\" But, it must be\r\nobserved, Touaricks are never made slaves; they may be murdered by the\r\nTibboos. Not six months ago the Aheer Touaricks captured a Tibboo\r\nvillage. The few who escaped fled to the Arabs, under the son of\r\nAbd-el-Geleel, imploring aid for the restoration of their countrymen and\r\nproperty. These Arabs, who themselves mostly live on freebooting, were\r\nglad of the opportunity for a razzia. They recaptured everything, and\r\nrestored the poor Tibboos to their village, making also a capture of a\r\nthousand camels from these Kylouy Touaricks.\r\n\r\nEnjoy better health in this journey, than on that from Ghadames to Ghat.\r\nFelt myself stronger, and hope yet to undertake the journey to Bornou\r\nbefore the summer heats.\r\n\r\n_15th._--Course to-day nearly east. Encamped just as the sun dipped down\r\nin the ruddy flame of the west. Strong wind, blanching the sooty cheeks\r\nof the poor slaves, who were borne down with exhaustion. They were\r\nliterally whipped along. And the little fellow who refused a ride from\r\nme, got a whipping for sitting on the sand to rest himself. I now made\r\nhim mount my camel, which his master, not a bad-natured man, thanked me\r\nfor. All day we continued to traverse the vast plain, having on our right\r\nthe same chain of hills, and, on the left, the sand groups, as far as the\r\neye could see. These broad, now boundless plains, or valleys, are\r\nunquestionably the dry beds of former currents. Even now our people\r\ncalled them wadys or rivers. The chain of mountains and the chain of\r\nsand-hills are their natural banks. The tholh-tree was most abundant\r\nto-day. I never saw it so thickly scattered before. It was spread over\r\nall the plain, now in single trees, and now in forest groups, which were\r\nalso magnified in the distance, and had a grateful and refreshing effect\r\nupon the vision, wearied with looking on stones or gravel, or bare\r\ndesert, or black rocks and glaring sand-hills. Unquestionably these trees\r\nof the African are as old as those of the American wilderness. The\r\ntholh-trees of the dry thirsty African plain are however but dwarfs\r\ncompared with the giant trees of the American forest, watered by ocean\r\nrivers. The tholh would seem to live without moisture: it is fed by no\r\nannual or periodic rain, no springs. And yet it buds, opens its pretty\r\nyellow flowers, sheds its fine large drops of translucent gum,\r\nflourishes all the year round, and tempts with its prickly leaves as with\r\nrichest herbage, the hungry camel. Indeed, about this part of the route\r\nthe camels get nothing else to feed on. We have seen no living creatures\r\nthese last five days. On one part of our route our people pretended to\r\ntrace the sand-prints of the wadan, and others affirmed them to be the\r\nfoot-marks of the wild-ox. I must except the sight of a few small birds,\r\nblack all over but the tails. Some one or two had white heads, as well as\r\nwhite tails. People say these birds drink no water, as they say many\r\nanimals of The Sahara drink no water. The little creatures certainly do\r\nnot drink much water. Two or three dead camels thrown across the route of\r\nthis day's march. The live camels usually turn off the way from them.\r\nSeveral Saharan mosques, the form of a cross being made in the Keblah on\r\none of them, as seen in the diagrams.\r\n\r\nThe Shereef's ideas of the Touaricks are not so favourable as those of\r\nhis uncle, the Governor of Ghat, and in some respects they are more\r\ncorrect. The Shereef says:--\"The Touaricks are not of the Arabian race.\r\nThey are the original inhabitants of Africa (Numidians). Their language\r\nis a Berber dialect. They are a race generally of bandits, and, when\r\ntheir food fails them, like famished wolves, they make irruptions into\r\ntheir neighbour's territory, and plunder what is before them. This they\r\ndo in small bodies, when camel's milk fails them at home. The Aheer\r\nTouaricks are of the same race as those of Ghat. Many of those of Aheer\r\nhave no fear of God, and never pray like the rest of professed\r\nMohammedans. Those of Ghat are perhaps the best of the Touaricks, and the\r\nmost religious. The Touaricks of Touat encircle those of Ghat, lying\r\nacross the route of Timbuctoo. Their Sultan's name is Bassa, a giant of\r\nThe Desert. He eats as much as ten men. He is the terror of all. But\r\nJabour knows him, and enjoys his friendship and confidence. The road from\r\nGhat to Timbuctoo, through Bassa's territory, is extremely short. It is\r\nstony, through high mountains, and intensely cold. Springs of water\r\nabound there.\" Such are the ideas and opinions of the Shereef on the\r\nTouaricks. The mountains of the route alluded to, are the grand nucleus\r\nof the Hagar, which intersect and ramify through all Central Sahara. The\r\nShereef, and some others travelling with us, delight in paradoxes, and\r\nmaintain, in spite of Haj Ibrahim, who has been to Constantinople and\r\nseen the Sultan of the Turks, that there is no Sultan now, the\r\nadministration at the Turkish capital being in the hands of Christians.\r\n\r\nThe Shereef now invited me to dine with him from bazeen, and when I sat\r\ndown, kept addressing me:--\"Eat plenty!\" But only think of three grown\r\nmen sitting down to a small paste dumpling, with a little melted butter\r\npoured over it, and the host crying out lustily to me:--\"Eat plenty!\"\r\nSuch, indeed, was our repast! Of course, returning to my encampment, I\r\nate my supper as if nothing had happened to me. And this little dumpling\r\nsupper is the only meal in the day which our people eat. Well may they\r\ncry out about the cold, and pray for the heat. In a hot day a man is\r\nsupposed to eat half the quantity which he does in a cold day. I am,\r\ntherefore, still of the same opinion as before expressed, that the\r\nsufferings of these people, who travel in Sahara, are enormously\r\nincreased from their want of sufficient food and clothing. As to\r\nclothing, many of them, in this trying season, go half-naked.\r\n\r\nSome of our Arabs, who make bazeen for a large party, have a scientific\r\nway for its cooking and preparation. On the Ghat route a young Arab was\r\naccustomed to fill up three parts of a large iron pot with water. This\r\nwater he would boil, throwing into it the meanwhile peppers, sliced\r\nonions, and occasionally, as a luxury, very small pieces of dried meat,\r\nor scraps from which fat had been strained. The pot having boiled until\r\nthe onions and peppers were soft, he now brings the meal, mostly\r\nbarley-meal, but sometimes coarse wheaten flour. This he pours into the\r\npot, forming a sort of pyramid in the boiling water. He then gets a\r\nstick, mostly a walking-stick, pretending first to scrape off the dirt,\r\nor rubbing it in the sand; with the stick so polished, he makes a hole in\r\nthe centre of the pyramid of meal, through which the water bubbles up and\r\ncirculates through the mealy mass, now fast cooking. He now gets two\r\nsmall pieces of stick, and puts them into the ears of the iron pot, which\r\ngenerally are burning hot. He removes with the pieces of stick the pot\r\nfrom off the fire, and places it on the sand. He now squats down over it,\r\nputting his two feet, or rather the great toes of the feet, one on each\r\near of the pot, which gives him a poise, or sort of fulcrum. And then,\r\nagain, taking the long stick, he stirs it up with all his might, round\r\nand round and round again, until all the water is absorbed in the\r\npudding-like meal, and the meal is thus well mixed into a sort of dough.\r\nHowever this dough is not unbaked paste, but a _bonâ-fide_ dumpling,\r\ncooked and ready for the sauce. Now comes the wash wherewith to wash it\r\ndown. My young Arab friend takes the dumpling, or pudding, in a great\r\nround mass, and places it within a huge wooden bowl. He then goes off for\r\nthe oil, or liquid butter, which is usually kept in a large leather\r\nbottle, or goat's-skin, with a long neck. He does not pour the oil out,\r\nbut thrusts one of his hands into the oil, and, taking it out, with his\r\nother hand rubs or squeezes off the oil over the mass of dumpling. When\r\nhe has got enough, he sets to and sucks his fingers, as the great reward\r\nof all his labour in preparing the supper of bazeen for his companions.\r\nOnce he did not sufficiently squeeze off the oil from his hands, and his\r\nuncle scolded him for leaving so much on to suck. He protested to his\r\nuncle that the bazeen had taken him an unusually long time to\r\nprepare[105]. The supper is now ready. The party squat round it on their\r\nhams. They dig into the mass with their fingers, after saying aloud, as\r\ngrace, _Bismillah_, \"In the name of God,\" before they begin supper.\r\nDigging thus into it, they make small or large balls, according to the\r\nmeasure of their jaws, which are generally sufficiently wide, or\r\naccording to the sharpness or dulness of their appetite. These balls they\r\nroll and roll over in the oil or sauce that is often made of a herb\r\ncalled hada, or âseedah, a pleasant bitter, and producing a yellow\r\ndecoction, (whence the bazeen is sometimes called,) which enables the\r\nlarge boluses to slip quietly and gratefully down the throat. Meanwhile\r\na jug of water is handed round, provided always there is any difficulty\r\nin getting down the balls; but mostly the water is handed round after the\r\neating. It is drunk with a _bismallah_, and then a _hamdullah_, or\r\n\"praise to God,\" the grace after meat, winds up and finishes the repast.\r\n\r\nThe business of the caravan and its affairs of encampment are always\r\nterminated before supper. So the dumpling or pudding-fed travellers now\r\nroll themselves up in their barracans, covering their faces entirely, and\r\nstretch themselves down on the ground to sleep, frequently not moving\r\nfrom the place where they ate their supper. There is generally a mat or\r\nskin under them, and they lie down under the shade of the bales of goods\r\nwhich their camels carry. The first thing on encamping is to look for the\r\ndirection of the wind, and so to arrange bales of goods, panniers, and\r\ncamel gear, as to protect the head from the wind. In this way one often\r\nlies very snug whilst the tempest howls through The Desert. People like\r\nto retain the taste of the pudding in their mouths, particularly if a\r\nlittle fat or oil be poured over it. I once gave an Arab some coffee\r\nafter his pudding-supper, which he drank with avidity, but afterwards\r\nbegan to abuse me. \"Yâkob, what is your coffee? I'm hungry, I'm ravenous.\r\nWhy, before I drank your coffee, my supper was up to the top of my\r\nthroat, but now I want to begin my supper again. I'll never drink any\r\nmore of your coffee, so don't bring it here.\" A little more cuscasou is\r\neaten on this route than on that of Ghat from Ghadames, the Fezzaneers\r\nand Tripolines preferring coarse cuscasou to bazeen if they can get it.\r\nThe poor Arabs are often obliged to put up with zumeetah, which they eat\r\ncold. Haj Ibrahim eats his fine cuscasou, which he brought from Tripoli,\r\nbut I do not consider him a _bonâ-fide_ Saharan merchant. This is his\r\nfirst trip in The Desert.\r\n\r\n_6th._--Rose as the day broke, with a hazy yellow tint over half the\r\nheavens, and started early in order to reach the well before night. Very\r\ncold, and continued so all day long. Felt my nerves braced, and liked\r\ncold better than heat. In proportion as I liked the cold, all my\r\ntravelling companions disliked this weather; all were shivering and\r\ncrumpled up creatures. The slaves suffered dreadfully, having\r\nshivering-fits and their eyes streaming with water. However, I could not\r\nhelp laughing at the Shereef and the Touatee, who kept crying out, as if\r\nin pain, \"_Mou zain el-berd_ (Not good is the cold!)\" And, to make it\r\nworse, they both rode all day, by which they felt the cold more. On the\r\ncontrary, I walked full three hours, and scarcely felt myself fatigued.\r\nIndeed, to-day, I was decidedly the best man of the caravan, and suffered\r\nless than any. I always walk an hour and a half every morning. But my\r\nGhadames shoes, that I'm anxious to preserve, are fast wearing out, which\r\nspoils some of the pleasure. The small stones of Desert soon cut and wear\r\nout a pair of soles, which are made of untanned camel's skin. Observed to\r\nthe Shereef, to tease him, \"Why, you Mussulmans don't know what is good.\r\nYour legs and feet are bare. You have nothing wrapt tight round your\r\nchest. Your woollens are pervious to the cold air. You're half naked; but\r\nfor myself, I'm clothed from head to foot, only a small portion of my\r\nface is exposed. You must go to the Christians to learn how to travel\r\nThe Desert.\" \"The Christians are devils,\" he returned, \"and can bear cold\r\nand heat like the Father of the imps in his house (perdition).\" \"Mou\r\nzain, el-berd,\" cried the Touatee. Yesterday and this morning the slaves\r\nwere oiled all over with olive-oil, to prevent their skin and flesh from\r\ncracking with the cold. This is a frequent practice, and reckoned a\r\nsovereign remedy. Hot oil is also often swallowed. Boiling oil is a\r\nfavourite remedy in North Africa for many diseases. The poor slaves were\r\nagain driven on by the whip. We reached the well just after sunset. Haj\r\nIbrahim rode far in advance on his maharee to see that the well was all\r\nright, our water being exhausted. Happily the weather prevented any great\r\nabsorption of its water. When the slaves got up, having suffered much\r\nto-day from thirst, although so cold, they rushed upon the water to\r\ndrink, kneeling on the sands, and five or six putting their heads in a\r\nbowl of water together. I myself had only drunk two cups of tea this\r\nmorning, Said having given the slaves all the water we had left. To-day's\r\nmarch convinced me that thirst may be felt as painfully on a cold day as\r\non a hot day.\r\n\r\nCourse, north-east, inclining to east. Met with some Fezzanee Touaricks,\r\nwho were a very different class of people from those of Ghat and Aheer.\r\nThey are simple shepherds, tending their flocks, mostly goats, in open\r\nDesert, which browse the scanty herbage of the plain. The mountain chain\r\non our right continues north with us. We found in our route the blood and\r\nfilth of a camel just killed. Dead or killed camels, are generally found\r\nnear the wells on the last day's journey, after having made five or six\r\ndays' forced marches to reach them. It is here they're knocked up, going\r\ncontinually and most patiently to the last moment of their strength, when\r\nthey expire at once.\r\n\r\nTeenabunda or \"Well of Bunda,\" is a well of sweet delicious water. It is\r\nsome thirty or forty feet deep. There is nothing to mark the site of the\r\nwell from the surrounding plain, nor palm tree, nor shrub, nor herbage of\r\nany kind. An accident alone could have discovered this well. Some stones\r\nare placed about in the form of seats, and one can easily see where there\r\nhas once been a fire from the sign or circumstance of three stones being\r\nplaced triangularly, leaving a small space between them for the fire.\r\nThese three stones also support the pot for cooking, as well as inclose\r\nthe fire. This evening took some bazeen with the Ghadamsee merchants.\r\nThey are fond of showing me this little mark of hospitality. However the\r\nsame thing was enacted as at the Shereef's supper. Three grown-up persons\r\nsat down to the one day's meal, a smallish dumpling, seasoned with highly\r\npeppered sauce of hada, and a little fat. It is quite absurd to call this\r\na supper for three persons; it is mocking European appetite. How they\r\nlive in this way I cannot comprehend.\r\n\r\n_17th._--Rose early, but did not start until the sun had two hours\r\nmounted the horizon. We usually start half an hour after sunrise. Weather\r\nfair and fine, a cool breeze and hot sun, which is suitable for the\r\nmiddle of the day. I do not feel it at all oppressive. Continued\r\nnorth-east. We now caught a glimpse of the palms of The Wady. But here we\r\novertook our Tripoline friends, who had left Ghat ten days before us and\r\nwere waiting for our arrival. They conducted us to their encampment. The\r\nparty consisted of Mustapha, an Alexandrian merchant of Tripoli, and\r\nanother merchant, having with them some sixty slaves. When our slaves\r\narrived these ran out to meet them, welcoming them in a most affectionate\r\nmanner as old friends. In fact, most of them had been companions in the\r\nroute from Aheer to Ghat, sharing one another's burthens and sufferings,\r\nhelping to alleviate their mutual pains. After being separated and sold\r\nto different masters, never expecting to see one another again, it is not\r\nsurprising there should have been such a tender and affectionate meeting\r\nof the poor things. I shall not soon forget the sight of two little girls\r\nwho unexpectedly met after being sold to different masters and separated\r\nsome weeks. The little creatures seized hold of one another's hands, then\r\neach took the the head of each other with the palms of the hand, pressing\r\nits side, in the meanwhile kissing one another passionately and sobbing\r\naloud. And yet those brutal republicans of America,\r\n\r\n    \"Whose fustian flag of freedom, waves\r\n    In mockery o'er a land of slaves--\"\r\n\r\nhave the devilish cruelty to continue to stigmatize, by their laws of\r\nequality and liberty, the Africans as goods and chattels, depriving them\r\nof their divine right of sentient and intellectual beings, having all the\r\ntenderest and holiest affections of humanity. These poor little girls\r\nwere quite unobserved by their masters or drivers, who were now occupied\r\nwith the rakas or courier, who had brought letters from Tripoli in answer\r\nto ours sent some time ago. The news is good for the merchants; the Pasha\r\nwill not exact the customs-dues of Fezzan on those who return this\r\nroute, on account of the war between the Shânbah and Touaricks.\r\n\r\nNear the well Haj Omer beckoned me to show me what he called,\r\n\"water-courses of Christians,\" ancient irrigating ducts of the people of\r\nformer times. These consisted of raised banks of earth, stretching across\r\nthe road to the mountains on the right. Along these lines of embankment\r\nwere large fields of cultivation, showing the country had declined in its\r\nagricultural industry, which, indeed, is manifest from every oasis I have\r\nyet seen in The Sahara. It is probable these earlier or ancient\r\ncultivators of the soil were colonies from the coast. Omer also pointed\r\nout at a distance, what he styled \"The tombs of Christians,\" on the sides\r\nof the mountains, scattered miles along, showing The Desert to have been\r\ncultivated to a far greater extent in past times.\r\n\r\nOur route from Ghat to Fezzan is good enough perhaps for man, being\r\nsimple and plain, easily traversed, generally on level surfaces, but it\r\nis very bad for animals, there being scarcely any herbage, except at\r\nSerdalas, and the Ghat Wadys. Our camels had little herbage for seven\r\ndays, which greatly tried their strength and endurance. The caravan we\r\nnow joined had lost two camels, and I was afraid for my nagah. Water they\r\nhad none for six days. The Soudan sheep also went without water those six\r\nlong days. Our route is thus mentioned by Dr. Oudney: \"There are several\r\nroutes to Ghat (from Mourzuk); and the upper one, where we had to enter\r\nthe hills, was last night fixed for us. There is plenty of water, but\r\nmore rough than the lower, which is said to be a sandy plain, as level as\r\nthe hand, but no water for five days.\" Travelling with slaves, a route\r\nis always extended one-fifth, at the very least: such was our case.\r\n\r\nAfternoon, we encamped at the mouth of the wady, weary, thirsty, and\r\nexhausted, which forcibly brought to my mind that oasis of rest,\r\n(wearied and disgusted, as I felt with Saharan travel,) so divinely\r\ndescribed in Desert pastoral style: ουδε μη πεσῃ επ' αυτους ὁ ἥλιος,\r\nουδε παν καυμα . . . . και ὁδηγησει αυτους επι ζωσας πηγας ὑδατων.\r\n(Rev vii. 16, 17.) We have in these divine words the smiting and\r\nparching of Saharan sun and heat, and the Lamb-Shepherd leading the\r\ndrooping flocks to the living life-giving springs of the oases of\r\nDesert.\r\n\r\nOur people called the series of little oases, which we now entered,\r\n_El-Wady_. But this term is hardly sufficiently distinctive, and, I\r\nthink in the general division of Fezzan, it is called _El-Wady\r\nGhurby_--‮الوادي الغربي‬--or \"The _Western_ Valley,\" in\r\ncontra-distinction from _El-Wady Esh-Sherky_, \"The _Eastern_\r\nValley.\"\r\n\r\n_18th._--Entered fully into The Wady this morning. After so much Desert,\r\nwas delighted to ecstasy with the refreshing sight of the distant forests\r\nof palms, crowd upon crowd in deepening foliage, their graceful heads\r\ncovering the face of the pale red horizon, as with hanging raven locks of\r\nsome beautiful woman. Saw a few huts of date branches, some wells, and\r\nhere and there a villager. The huts were so blended with the date-palms,\r\nin colour and make, that it was with difficulty our eye could catch sight\r\nof them. I am often astonished how these slight, feeble tenements can\r\nprotect the people from the sun and cold and wind. It is like living in\r\nopen Desert. When we had continued our course some two hours, the Sheikh\r\nof the district came running out after us, demanding the customs-dues,\r\nand attempting to stop the slaves for payment. \"What does this fellow\r\nwant?\" I said to our people, feeling myself now under the protection of\r\nthe Tripoline government, and knowing the Sheikh to be subjected to the\r\nBey of Mourzuk. They replied, \"Oh, he wants some slaves to work at the\r\nwater (by irrigation).\" The Sheikh would not be said \"nay.\" He demanded\r\nto see the teskera of the Pasha exempting us from the duties, which he\r\ncould not, as Haj Ibrahim was gone to purchase dates. He then commenced\r\nseizing slaves, but our Arabs now attacked him, pushing and dragging him\r\naway. These people are mighty fond of a little scuffling. We encamped for\r\nthe night in The Wady. More \"Tombs of Christians\" were pointed out to me.\r\nMany dwarf palms were scattered about, wild and producing no fruit. Water\r\nmay be under the surface. Our people say these palms would all bear fruit\r\nif cultivated and watered. Undoubtedly many more could be cultivated.\r\nThere are innumerable palms in this wild dwarf state. My nagah growled\r\nand grumbled on seeing the palms, rightly concluding that we were arrived\r\nin an inhabited country. These melancholy-looking creatures are extremely\r\nwise. The other evening we had great trouble to get the nagah to eat\r\nherbage when she was brought to the encampment. She had for her supper\r\nevery evening a few dates and barley for several successive days. Now we\r\nleft off giving her them on arriving at The Wady, where there was\r\nabundant herbage. This she resented, and grumbled nearly all night,\r\nkeeping us from sleeping, and would not eat the herbage. On encamping,\r\nthe camels are allowed to stray and graze an hour or two, and are then\r\nbrought up to the encampment for the night, the drivers cutting a little\r\nherbage for them to eat during the night, or in the morning before\r\nstarting. Like us, more intelligent brutes, the camels don't like\r\nstarting on a journey with an empty stomach.\r\n\r\nHaj Ibrahim expressed surprise that I had with me religious books. He\r\nthought the English had \"no books,\" (that is, religious books.) Some\r\nChristians in Tripoli (Roman Catholics) had told him the English people\r\nhad no books. He then observed to me, that it was wrong to worship Mary,\r\nwho was not God, or the mother of God, for God had no mother or father.\r\nAnd although the French and Maltese, in Tripoli, had told him the English\r\nhad a bad religion, it could not, he observed, be a worse religion than\r\nthis, that of worshiping a woman instead of God. Of Mary, he continued,\r\n\"She was a good woman, and conceived without a husband. Mary merely\r\nwished to bear a child, and as it was a pious wish, God granted her\r\nrequest, and by a simple word she conceived and bore Jesus.\" Of slaves,\r\nthe merchant, says:--\"They are brought from all countries of Soudan,\r\nnearly a thousand countries. Only a few slaves captured or brought to the\r\nSouk are Mussulmans, they're nearly all Pagans. Mussulmans make war\r\nagainst infidels to get prisoners, as we and you did formerly; the\r\nMaltese[106] and English made us slaves, and we made you slaves. Some of\r\nthe slaves are Christians, (_i. e._ Pagans,) and some are Jews.\" I was\r\nmuch interested, and questioned the merchant about this latter remark,\r\nwhen a Negro slave, who had been lately to Soudan with his master,\r\nobserved, \"The black Jews keep the Sabbath, and get drunk on that day.\r\nThey drink bouza (or grain liquor). They also circumcise as we\r\nMohammedans.\" It is probable these Negro Jews are the corrupt descendants\r\nof the converts of Abyssinian Jews, who ages ago penetrated Central\r\nAfrica _viâ_ the provinces of Darfour and Kordofan, and the countries\r\nlying on the two great branches of the sources of the Nile. In the\r\nbeginning of our era, we hear of the Eunuch of the \"Queen of the\r\nSouth[107],\" or of Abyssinia, who was a Jew, and converted by Philip to\r\nChristianity. There is therefore no manner of difficulty in accounting\r\nfor the presence of these corrupt degenerate black Jews, amongst the\r\ntribes of Central Africa.\r\n\r\nTwo little girl-slaves were barbarously whipped this evening for eating\r\nhasheesh (herbage), which they picked up on the roadside. This was done\r\nto prevent them having diarrhœa, and eating poisonous herbs. It was\r\nnevertheless what they had been taught to do on the Aheer route, and\r\nthere could not be very much harm in picking up a little fresh juicy\r\nherbage, to appease their thirst during the heat of the day's march. The\r\nslaves _en route_ are only permitted to drink twice in the day, once at\r\nnoon, and once in the evening. When our supply of water is scanty, only\r\nonce a day.\r\n\r\n_19th._--This morning made but three hours' journey through The Wady\r\nOases. We had not proceeded an hour _en route_, when the same farce was\r\nattempted to be played upon us as yesterday; three or four people coming\r\ngalloping up to us to stop us, in order to collect the customs-dues. This\r\nthey did a second time, after letting us go on once. I was determined now\r\nto show I was not a slave-dealer, and would not be stopped to suit their\r\ncaprice, for we told them we had a teskera from the Pasha, exempting us\r\nfrom the gomerick. Proceeding forwards with Said, one of the party, a\r\nfellow on horse-back, stopped my nagah, seized her, and commenced beating\r\nSaid. I instantly jumped off, exclaiming, \"I'm an Englishman--a\r\nChristian, and not a slave-dealer; I have nothing on which to pay duties,\r\nand will not be stopped.\" Our people bawled out likewise, \"The Christian\r\nhas nothing for the gomerick, he has no slaves.\" The fellow gave Said\r\nanother rap with his sword on his attempting to rescue our camel.\r\nHereupon, losing all patience, I took the spear, and with the flat part\r\nof its head gave the fellow a tolerable blow on the shoulders. Now\r\nfollowed a desperate scuffle, the first I had had in The Desert. The\r\nfellow screaming out, suddenly maddened to fury, drew his sword, and made\r\na thrust at me, but the blow was turned by the shaft of my lance. Our\r\npeople now seized hold of him and me. A little more scuffling went on,\r\nand getting clear of the grasp of our people, I made off in advance, with\r\nSaid, alone. After continuing half an hour through the palm-woods, we\r\nturned and saw the whole caravan coming up quickly after us. The party\r\nwho stopped us had consented to let the caravan follow me. Haj Ibrahim,\r\nwho had the Pasha's teskera, was again absent, having gone to purchase\r\nmore dates. If the fellow had not been very impudent and violent,\r\ninflicting blows on Said, I should not have committed this folly of\r\nforcing my way, for, after all, it was great imprudence on my part, and\r\nmight have been attended with very serious consequences.\r\n\r\nWhen the caravan came up, I said, in hearing of our people, to the fellow\r\nwho was still following them, \"If you had struck my servant in Tripoli,\r\nthe Pasha would have put you in prison. This is not Touarghee country,\r\nbut a country where there is a government. This country belongs to\r\nTripoli and the Sultan. Your violence was equally improper and\r\nunnecessary.\" All applauded this, and our champion of the sword said\r\nnothing in reply. After arriving at the small district of Blad\r\nMarabouteen, or \"a country of Marabouts,\" we encamped for the day. The\r\nfellow, who turned out to be an Egyptian, a petty officer of the Porte,\r\nand Kaed of the district through which we passed, now came to me, sat\r\ndown by my side, and made it up. I then observed to him, \"It's all\r\nnonsense.\" The Egyptian laughed and I laughed. He kept seizing me by the\r\nhand, and exclaiming with vehemence, \"Gagliuffi! Gagliuffi! ah! that's a\r\nfine fellow! Gagliuffi at Mourzuk.\" Again the Egyptian laughed, and\r\nscreamed with frantic gesticulations, and our people coming up were also\r\nmerry with him. \"Ah!\" he continued, \"Gagliuffi, a real cock of the\r\ndunghill, a noble fellow, Gagliuffi! Do you know Gagliuffi?\" I said I did\r\nnot. This he couldn't understand, and said, \"Ah, Gagliuffi has got plenty\r\nof money, he's the Bashaw of Mourzuk. Every time you go to see him he\r\ngives you coffee.\" Another Fezzaneer, standing by, swore to this:\r\n\"Gagliuffi is the Bey! Gagliuffi has got plenty of money.\" Afterwards I\r\nreported this affair to Mr. Gagliuffi, our Vice-Consul at Mourzuk. He was\r\ngreatly amused and flattered at the report of his wealth and consequence.\r\nHe observed, \"Although I'm poor enough, God knows, it's better that these\r\npeople should think me rich.\" The Egyptian was commanding a small force\r\nof Arabs in The Wady. I learnt from him, the Vice-Consul had been sick\r\nlately, but was now better. In The Wady there is fever during summer, but\r\nnot much now. The Kaed, I saw in conversing with him, had been drinking\r\nleghma, and was \"elevated,\" which sufficiently accounted for his\r\ninterrupting our march, and the violence of his conduct. Our people say,\r\nhe wished us to encamp in his district, to amuse himself with us. They\r\ncontinued all the evening to praise my spirit for resisting the fellow's\r\nimpertinence in his stopping us. \"To-day you were a man, Yâkob,\" they\r\nkept repeating. I explained, \"Fear, where fear is necessary, as in the\r\nTouarghee districts. There we must bow the head, for resistance would be\r\ndangerous. But here, in the country of the Sultan, why should we fear?\"\r\nThis speech greatly pleased our people, who themselves had not been\r\ndetained by the Kaed, on account of my forcing the way. Upon the whole,\r\nthis ludicrous affray raised my reputation for (physical) courage amongst\r\nthe people. For moral courage I always take credit to myself. It is\r\nnevertheless, a very delicate thing in Saharan travel to know when and\r\nwhere resistance is to be offered against imposition: and perhaps, it is\r\nbetter to give way always than to resist, leaving the matters of dispute\r\n(of this sort especially) to be settled by the caravan with which you\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nThe united caravans will remain here some eight or ten days, to give rest\r\nto the slaves, as well as to obtain fresh provisions. To-morrow morning I\r\ngo early to Mourzuk, which is two days from The Wady. Tripoli is distant\r\nfrom The Wady, fifteen, seventeen, or twenty days, according to the\r\nprogress of the caravan. The route lies direct _viâ_ Shaty, four days'\r\ndistant from this, and Mizdah, in the mountains (Gharian), ten or twelve\r\ndays, and thence three days more to Tripoli. The route from El-Wady to\r\nShaty consists of groups of sand-hills, of painful traverse. Shaty itself\r\nis a series of oases. Between El-Hasee and El-Ghareeah, which now follow,\r\nthere is an immeasurable expanse of Desert plain. The Atlas Mountains\r\nthen succeed with their bubbling fountains and green valleys, and\r\nolive-clad peaks. Mizdah in The Mountains consists of two large villages.\r\n\r\nSaw several of the inhabitants of The Wady, and made acquaintance with\r\nthe Fezzaneers, as they have been called. Some of them are as black as\r\nnegroes, others as white as the Moors of the coast, others olive, yellow,\r\nbrown, &c., and their features are various as the colour of their\r\ncomplexions. The Fezzaneers must be considered Moors and townspeople,\r\nrather than Arabs or nomades. Houses in The Wady are of palm-branches,\r\nand some of sun-dried mud-bricks, but mostly miserable hovels, the very\r\npicture of wretchedness. We passed a village entirely abandoned, (Kelah,\r\nas the people said,) apparently from the failure of water. Palms in The\r\nWady are not very fine. There are many patches of cultivation of grain\r\nand vegetables. Water is found near the surface, and the wells are\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\n_20th._--I left our caravan early this morning for Mourzuk. On taking\r\nleave of my companions of travel they begged me to come back, and\r\ncontinue the route with them to Tripoli. Could only promise in the style\r\nof En-Shallah, \"If God wills,\" for I had long made up my time not to\r\nreturn. Should the Bornou route be favourable, I might go up before the\r\nhot weather came on; if not, I intend returning _viâ_ Sockna to Tripoli,\r\n\"the royal road,\" wishing to see as much as possible of the inhabitants\r\nof the oases of The Sahara, on which route were many centres of\r\npopulation. My companions, from whom I had received nothing but kindness,\r\ncontinued to call after me, \"Come back, Yâkob,\" until our little company\r\nwas out of sight. I thought this extremely friendly, and another instance\r\nof the unadulterated kindness of heart found in Saharan traders. Our\r\ncourse now lay somewhat back again, we proceeding south-east. We had to\r\ncut through the mountains which had been so long on our right. The range\r\nstill continued north up The Wady, but how far I cannot tell. I believe\r\nno European whatever has travelled the route _viâ_ Shaty and Mizdah, to\r\nTripoli. As we ascended through the gorge or break in the chain, \"the\r\ntombs of the Christians\" were again pointed out to me, or rather the\r\nburying-places of the earlier inhabitants of these regions. All the early\r\ninhabitants, or those before the Mohammedan conquest of Africa, are\r\nvulgarly called Ensara by Moors. These tombs consist simply of circular\r\nheaps of stones, picked up from the rocks around. Some are large,\r\nperhaps a dozen yards in circumference. Mounting one, I found it hollow\r\nat the top; the stones had been merely heaped up in a circular ring.\r\nWithin was a little sand settled, collected from the wind when it\r\nscatters the sand about. There was no appearance of bones, or any\r\ninscriptions. The whole mountain range of The Wady, I am told, has heaps\r\nof stones piled up in this way. There is no doubt but what they are the\r\ngraves of former inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe question to be solved is, why are these graves of this circular form?\r\nwhy heaps or rings of stones thus heaped up, so different from the long\r\nsquare graves now met with in all North Africa and The Desert? The form\r\nof these tumuli evidently denote another people, or at least a people of\r\nanother religion. Where there are tombs there are legends of the dead. My\r\ntravelling companions now related to me, that there appears not\r\nunfrequently, and mostly at midnight, when the moon has but a narrow dim\r\ncirclet, a solitary Christian, who flits mournfully through these\r\nsolitudes, now and then sitting on the circular tombs, now peeping from\r\nwithin the rings of stones, his chin resting on the edge. His aspect is\r\nhideous, and he has one big burning eye-ball in the middle of his\r\nforehead. His skin (for he is naked) is covered with long hair, like a\r\nshaggy goat (a species of satyr), and two tusks come out of his mouth,\r\nlike those of a wild boar. A holy Marabout once met him, and interrogated\r\nhim courageously about his doleful doings amongst these graves. The\r\nspectre deigned this answer, \"I mourn the fall of my fellow-Christians\r\nand the triumph of the Faithful over the Infidels. The Devil makes me\r\ncome here. I shall wander until the appearance of Gog and Magog upon the\r\nearth, and then shall be yoked to their chariot, and go out and conquer\r\nthe world, and kill the Faithful. But I shall be tormented afterwards.\r\nSuch is my doom: I can't help it.\" It is said the Marabout pitied him,\r\nand prayed to God for him, but it was revealed to the holy man in a\r\ndream, not to pray for lost spirits, whom Heaven's decrees had\r\nirrevocably doomed to perdition.\r\n\r\nThere was also another legend related to me by the Fezzan Targhee, who\r\nwas now my guide through this dreary gorge, full of the tombs of the\r\ndead. It is too long to repeat. Suffice it to say that, whilst his\r\ngreat-grandfather and other shepherds were tending their flocks on the\r\nsubjected plains below, a troop of these Christians broke loose from the\r\ndark caverns in the mountains, where they are chained, and began to abuse\r\nand banter the shepherds, because they did not say, \"There are three\r\nGods.\" The shepherds withstood the temptation and the terror of their\r\ncountenances, although they, the shepherds, exceedingly quaked. The\r\nChristians, in their rage against the shepherds professing so constantly\r\nthe Unity of God, dispersed their flocks, drove them into the caverns,\r\nand disappeared together with the flocks. But the angel Gabriel descended\r\nfrom heaven, and blessed the faithful shepherds, led them on many miles\r\nto a desert place, where there were three tholh-trees which had been\r\nplanted by these reprobate Spirits in adoration to The Three Gods. Now\r\nthe number of shepherds also happened to be three. The good Gabriel told\r\nthem to cut down the trees, and burn them separately. The shepherds did\r\nso, and for their obedience, from beneath the ashes a great cake of\r\nmolten gold came pouring out. \"These cakes are the Gods of the\r\nChristians; there are three of these cakes,\" said Gabriel. \"Take each\r\none, and go, and trade to Soudan,\" added the angelical messenger; and\r\nthen in a bright cloud ascended over the top of the mountains. It so\r\nhappened that his great-grandfather thought three was a lucky number, and\r\nwished to become a Christian, whereupon God caused a troop of banditti to\r\nfall upon his caravan, who plundered him of everything, and reduced him\r\nagain to beggary. Such are the tales of Marabouts of The Sahara, quite a\r\nmatch for the legends of our Monks of the good and happy olden times.\r\n\r\nAs these legends finished, we got up to the top of the range, when a cold\r\nbleak wind cut our faces, coming north-east over the plateau, which to my\r\nsurprise now appeared. I expected to find a descent, or another rounded\r\nside of the chain. But all east was a bare, bleak, black plateau, as\r\nhideous as desolation could render it, according well with the scenery of\r\nthe desolate grave-stones we had just seen, and the woeful tales about\r\nthem we had heard. It was the veritable beach of the river Styx. I turned\r\nwith a chill of horror from the waste back again upon the valley which we\r\nhad left. How different the view! Here we beheld the ten thousand fair\r\nwaving palms, which cover the green bosom of The Wady,--a paradise\r\nencircled with ridges and outlines of the most frightful sterility. We\r\nnow mounted our camels, for it was necessary to face also this new\r\ndesert. I greatly perspired with the labour of the ascent, and now caught\r\na cold, and had a bilious attack, the only time I was seriously unwell\r\nduring my nine months in The Desert, and strange enough that it should\r\nbe occasioned by cold. Our party consisted of myself and Said, the\r\nTarghee guide, and Mustapha, the Tripoline Moor, who was going to\r\npurchase provisions, and borrow money at Mourzuk. These merchants so ill\r\nmanage their affairs, that they were nearly out of provisions for their\r\nsome hundred and odd slaves, themselves and servants, and besides had no\r\nmoney to replenish their stock. Our course was now east verging to the\r\nsouth. On the plain I saw the last of the Touaricks, and it was a noble\r\nsight. This was a Targhee Scout, scouring The Desert in search of the\r\nShânbah, well-equipped and mounted on his maharee. He was returning\r\nsouth-west to Ghat, taking the route over the mountains which we had just\r\nascended.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter a few hours we again descended into a small shallow wady, where was\r\na little herbage. We continued all day, and endeavoured to reach a part\r\nof the plateau, where were some Fezzan Touaricks tending their flocks,\r\nand where it was said we should get milk and a kid of the goat to kill\r\nand eat. The whole of the day it was cold, and the wind piercing, which I\r\nattributed to the elevated region we traversed. On arriving at a thin\r\nscattered forest of tholh-trees we stopped, but being most unusually\r\nexhausted by the fatigue of the ride, and the attack of the bile, I could\r\nnot dismount from my camel, and was lifted off. We searched a long time\r\nfor the shepherds, and at length their flocks were discovered. I took a\r\nlittle tea, and surrendered myself to rest and to sleep, not being able\r\nto eat anything. My companions pretended to seek out and purchase a kid,\r\nbut unless you furnish the money, nothing of this luxurious sort is ever\r\nobtained in The Desert. I had no money, and we had no kid. Meanwhile our\r\npeople, who had only brought with them dates, ate up my little stock of\r\ncuscasou. I had only laid in a sufficient quantity for some fifteen days,\r\nfrom Ghat to Mourzuk. Passed a bad night, and greatly relaxed.\r\n\r\n_21st._--Up to this time I had always travelled through The Desert with a\r\nlarge number of persons. Our party was now only four. And yet I felt no\r\nfear, and went to bed last night in open desert with as much indifference\r\nas if I had been in a hotel in Europe. Such is the force of habit. The\r\nDesert itself now even begins to wear a homely face to me, and, indeed,\r\nfor the present, I am obliged to make it my home. We rose early, and I\r\nfound myself a little better. At the time I attributed my illness to the\r\nwater of The Wady, but which was incorrect. Before starting, I obtained a\r\nbowl of sour milk. To my surprise I saw only women tending these flocks.\r\nI asked about their husbands. They were gone away to work in Ghat,\r\nFezzan, and other parts. Here were three or four adult women, and a few\r\nchildren, wandering solitarily in Open Desert! Not a habitation was near\r\nfor many miles round! I could not help exclaiming, \"Are you not afraid of\r\nrobbers?\" \"No,\" replied an aged woman, \"I have been here all my life, and\r\nshall die here. Why go away? What better shall I find in Mourzuk or Ghat?\r\nCan they give me more than milk? More than milk I care not for. And God\r\nis here as elsewhere!\" Let the reader picture to his mind's eye, three or\r\nfour lone females, with a child or two, wandering over a sandy plain,\r\ntending amongst a thinly-scattered forest of gum-acacia trees a few small\r\ngoats, without a house or even a hut to sleep under, only the shade of a\r\nstraw mat suspended in the prickly trees, and, then, repeat and mark well\r\nthe truth of Pope's fine lines,--\r\n\r\n    \"Order is heaven's first law, and this confess'd,\r\n    Some are, and must be, greater than the rest,--\r\n    More rich, more wise; but who infers from hence\r\n    That such are happier, shocks all common sense.\"\r\n\r\nOur people observed to me, \"This is a country of the Sultan, so the women\r\nfear nothing.\" But the environs of Ghadames are the country of the\r\nSultan, which does not prevent the depredations of banditti. There is no\r\nwater here, they go to Agath to bring their water for themselves and\r\ntheir flocks. Of course, the complexion of these shepherdesses is quite\r\nbrown or brown-black, by exposure to the weather. I shall ever remember\r\nthe modest air with which a nomade young woman came and presented us with\r\na bowl of milk. It was modesty's self's picture! The shepherdess nymph\r\nstepped forward timidly, with her eyes averted, not presuming even to\r\nlook at us; and as soon as she placed the bowl on the ground, a short\r\ndistance from us, she escaped to the thicket of the tholh-tree, like a\r\nyoung roe of the timid trembling herd. On her glowing cheek,--\r\n\r\n    \"Sweet virgin modesty reluctant strove,\r\n    While browsing goats at ease around her fed.\"\r\n\r\n    \"And now she sees her own dear flock\r\n    Beneath verdant boughs along the rock--\r\n    And her innocent soul at the peaceful sight\r\n    Is swimming o'er with a still delight.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a picture of pure heartfelt shyness and delicate modesty could only\r\nbe witnessed in these solitudes, where this maiden shepherdess never\r\nperhaps speaks to any man but her own way-worn, severe, but\r\nhonest-hearted father, when he returns from his little peregrinations,\r\nbringing a few blankets, a little barley and oil, the staple matters of\r\nexistence for these lonely nomades. Nothing was given in return for the\r\nmilk, for we had nothing to give. But if offered it would not have been\r\naccepted, by the laws of hospitality amongst these desert Arcadians. The\r\nreason now assigned for not giving us a kid, is, all the men are absent,\r\nand they cannot part with one, even if money be sent from Mourzuk for\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nAbout 3 P.M., to my great joy, we arrived at the village of Agath. Our\r\nroute was over a bare level plain, and our progress like at sea, when the\r\nmasts of the ship are first seen, then the hull; so here we first saw the\r\nheads of the date-palms, then their trunks, and then the clusters of the\r\nhovels of the village. I was happy to learn our guide determined to pass\r\nthe night here. The poor fellow was himself worn to a skeleton in\r\ntravelling these wastes, with but one eye left, and that very dim. He was\r\nglad to \"put up\" for the night. When he started it was to have been a\r\njourney of a day and a half, it was now to be three days. We got into an\r\nempty hovel, and with palm-branches kindled a fire, which was kept up in\r\na blaze to serve for a lamp. This is the usual practice, now and then\r\nputting on a piece of wood to make a light. Very few Saharans have the\r\nluxury of lamps or candles. I still suffered from bile, languor, and\r\nexhaustion, and once placed upon my mattress, I did not leave it till\r\nnext morning. We had no provisions, for our party had eaten up all I had.\r\nWe tried to get something from the Sheikh of the village, but only\r\nsucceeded in obtaining a few loaves of newly-baked bread, with a little\r\nherb sauce, hot with peppers, to pour upon the bread to moisten it.\r\nMustapha attempted to make a great noise, and talked about reporting him\r\nto the Pasha of Mourzuk, and getting him bastinadoed for treating a\r\nChristian in this way. I discouraged these threats, and would have no\r\nimbroglio, for I knew the character of the Sheikh could not well be worse\r\nthan that of Mustapha himself. Mustapha demanded meat, but I begged only\r\na little flour and butter to make some bazeen in the morning. The Sheikh\r\npromised and took leave. In the morning the Sheikh fled, and we saw no\r\nmore of him. He deserved to be reported at Mourzuk. Hospitality certainly\r\ndoes not flourish at Agath. It's odd, the only time I was seriously ill,\r\nand really wanted hospitality, I found it not. To-day we picked off\r\nseveral fine pieces of gum from the tholh. Many of the trees had their\r\nbranches lopped off, first for allowing the goats to nibble the green\r\nleaves, and afterwards to use the dry branches for firing.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[103] In the East Indies persons are known to become blind _for\r\n    the night_, (something like the _night-blindness_, which we have\r\n    before mentioned,) by the influence of the moon; or such is what\r\n    people say.\r\n\r\n[104] In the Koran it is intimated that God fattens the wicked in\r\n    this world for the day of slaughter in the next. I forget the Surat.\r\n    The Arabic is--‮سنسدرجهم‬--signifying, \"_We_ (God) _make\r\n    them proceed by degrees_;\" that is to say, We, God, give the\r\n    wicked pleasures and enjoyments in this world, that we may punish\r\n    them the more in the next world. This is a most abominable\r\n    sentiment, and intolerable to a right-thinking mind. But I believe\r\n    such a blasphemous opinion has also been held by some mad-brained\r\n    Christians.\r\n\r\n[105] In the event of my publisher bringing out a new edition of\r\n    the venerable Mrs. Glass, or Mrs. Rundall, I fervently hope he\r\n    will not fail to avail himself of this receipt for the making of\r\n    bazeen. I am also of the opinion of the former ancient dame, with\r\n    regard to the necessity of catching a hare before it is dressed;\r\n    and I think the meal likewise must be procured before it is made\r\n    into bazeen. To be eaten with relish, it besides must be eaten in\r\n    The Desert.\r\n\r\n[106] The oath taken by the Knights of the Order of Malta,\r\n    was--\"_To kill, or make the Mohammedans prisoners, for the glory\r\n    of God_.\"\r\n\r\n[107] \"And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority\r\n    under Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all\r\n    her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for worship.\"--(Acts viii.\r\n    27.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nRESIDENCE AT MOURZUK.\r\n\r\n     Arrival at Mourzuk; and reported as a Christian Marabout from\r\n     Soudan.--Meet Angelo, who conducts me to his Master, the British\r\n     Vice-Consul.--Hearty Welcome from Mr. Gagliuffi.--Detail of the\r\n     Slave-Caravans of The Wady.--Read the Newspapers; Massacre of\r\n     Jemâ-el-Ghazouat, and the Annexation of Texas.--Visit to the\r\n     Bashaw of Mourzuk.--Visits to the Commandant of the Garrison and\r\n     the Kady.--Poetical Scrap of European Antiquity.--Celebration of\r\n     a Wedding.--Environs of Mourzuk.--Camera Oscura.--Mourzuk\r\n     Couriers.--The Kidnapped Circassian Officer.--Old Yousef, the\r\n     Renegade.--Dine with the Greek Doctor on a Carnival Day.--An\r\n     Albanian's Revenge.--Greece and its Diplomatists.--Officials of\r\n     Mourzuk.--An Arab's estimate of God and Mahomet.--What is\r\n     Truth?--Improvements of the Commandant of the Troops.--How\r\n     English Politics taste in The Desert.--Visit to the Grave of Mr.\r\n     Ritchie.\r\n\r\n\r\n_22nd._--ROSE early, and got off again as well as I could, considering I\r\nhad had little or nothing to eat for the last two days, and should have\r\nnothing till the evening, when we expected to reach Mourzuk. Course east\r\nand south-east. Still cold and windy. Palms scattered over all the route,\r\nfrom Agath to Mourzuk, but only a few of them cultivated. It was most\r\nrefreshing to behold so many trees on our road, after traversing such\r\ntreeless and sandy wastes. A few wells here and there, and a little corn\r\ncultivation. Arrived at Mourzuk at about 4 P.M.\r\n\r\nI here thought of a squib which had been published in a rival paper at\r\nMalta, representing me as \"The Consul of the Blacks at Mourzuk\" in\r\nallusion to and satirizing my anti-slavery propensities. These things\r\nwill come back to one's memory years and years after they have been\r\nforgotten. When I read the squib, I little imagined I should ever visit\r\nMourzuk, and yet the visit could be traced readily enough as resulting\r\nfrom my anti-slavery labours in Malta and the Mediterranean. Mustapha\r\nstopped at the gate to make his toilet, and I lent him my barracan to\r\nmake on entering the city. Moors and all Saharan travellers dress\r\nthemselves up before they enter any large or particular place, when on a\r\njourney, and they wonder why I do not follow their nice tidy example. On\r\nentering Mourzuk, I suppose I looked very queer, for it was immediately\r\nreported to the Bashaw, \"A Christian Marabout is arrived from Soudan.\" We\r\nwere stopped a few minutes at the gates, to see if I had any exciseable\r\narticles. This done, I made the best of my way to the residence of Mr.\r\nGagliuffi. On the road I casually met the Maltese servant of the\r\nVice-Consul. His face brightened up with joyful amazement, and he shook\r\nme eagerly by the hands. Englishmen arrive here once in half a century,\r\nor rather never, which sufficiently accounts for the excitement of the\r\nMaltese. Angelo took me direct to the Consul's house, and I found Mr.\r\nGagliuffi at the door. The Consul was as astonished to see me as his\r\nservant. He stared at me as if I had just dropped from the clouds. He had\r\nheard of my going to Ghadames, Ghat, and Soudan, but did not expect to\r\nsee me one while. I need not add, Mr. Gagliuffi gave me a most hearty\r\nwelcome. I found the Consul in a very fine and spacious house for oases\r\nof Desert, with \"all his English[108] comforts around him,\" as we say.\r\nSeven months had made me forget all these things, and I was now a Saharan\r\nentering into the domains of comfortable, if not civilized, life. The\r\nappearance of Mourzuk was not very pleasing to me, the major part of its\r\ndwellings being miserable hovels. The Castle looked dirty, and tumbling\r\ndown. Nevertheless, the presence of Turkish troops and officers in\r\nuniform about the streets, with a variety of people congregated from\r\ndifferent towns and districts of Sahara, gave the place more the aspect\r\nof a city than any other town I had seen since I left Tripoli. I was\r\nextremely knocked up and unwell, and at once determined not to leave\r\nMourzuk until my health should be restored. I found myself right as to\r\nthe date of my arrival at Mourzuk, on comparing notes with Mr. Gagliuffi;\r\nbut two days wrong as to the name of the day, having written down Friday\r\ninstead of Sunday. As to the Moorish reckoning of Ghat and Ghadames, that\r\nwas quite different from the name of the day, and the number of the day,\r\nas found in Mourzuk. Time is very badly and incorrectly kept in The\r\nSahara.\r\n\r\nSome few particulars must now be recorded of the slave-caravans which I\r\nleft in The Wady. The united number was some one hundred and thirty\r\nslaves. Two-thirds were females, and these young women or girls. There\r\nwere a few children. Necessity teaches some of the best as well as the\r\nsternest lessons. A child of three years of age rode a camel alone, and\r\nwithout fear. The poor little creature knew if it complained or\r\ndiscovered itself frightened, it would be obliged to walk through The\r\nDesert. The slaves were fed in the morning with dates, and in the evening\r\nwith ghusub. Female slaves, after the style of Aheer people, pounded the\r\nghusub in a large wooden mortar, just before cooking. But they had little\r\nto eat, and were miserably fed, except those who had the good fortune to\r\nbe purchased by Haj Ibrahim. For some of these improvident stupid\r\nmerchants had actually purchased slaves without the means of keeping\r\nthem. On arriving at The Wady, they sent jointly, through Haj Ibrahim, to\r\nborrow a hundred dollars of the Bashaw of Mourzuk. The messenger was\r\nMustapha. His Highness kindly enough handed him over the money. All the\r\nmasters carried a whip, but this was rarely used, except to drive them\r\nalong the road, when they lagged from exhaustion. Thus it was\r\nadministered at times when it could least be borne, when nature was\r\nsinking from fatigue and utter weariness! and therefore was cruel and\r\ninhuman. Yet only some twenty were sick, and two died. When very ill they\r\nwere lashed upon the back of the camel. Some of the young women that had\r\nbecome favourites of their masters experienced a little indulgence. I\r\nobserved occasionally love-making going on between the slaves, and some\r\nof the boys would carry wood for the girls. My servant Said had one or\r\ntwo black beauties under his protection. But everything was of the most\r\ninnocent and correct character. Some groups of slaves were aristocratic,\r\nand would not associate with the others. Three young females under the\r\ncare of the Shereef, assumed the airs and attitude of exclusives, and\r\nwould not associate with the rest. Every passion and habit of civilized,\r\nis represented in savage life. A perfect democracy, in any country and\r\nstate of society, is a perfect lie, and a leveller is a brainless fool.\r\nThere is also an aristocracy in crime and in virtue, in demons and in\r\nangels. The slaves are clad variously. Haj Ibrahim tried to give every\r\none of his a blanket or barracan, more or less large. Besides this, the\r\nfemales had a short chemise, and a dark-blue Soudan cotton short-sleeved\r\nfrock. Many had only this frock. The poor creatures suffered more from\r\nthe ignorant neglect of the Touaricks than the Tripoline merchants, and\r\ntheir complaints and diseases usually begin with their former masters.\r\nYet I am assured by Mr. Gagliuffi, that the Touaricks of Aheer are\r\ninfinitely better and kinder masters than the Tibboo merchants of Bornou,\r\nor even many Tripolines. The Tibboos cannot bring a female child over The\r\nDesert of the tender age of six or seven, without deflowering her, whilst\r\nthe Touaricks of Aheer shudder at such sensual brutality, and even bring\r\nmaidens to the market of an advanced age. The brutal Tibboos besides\r\nbring their slaves quite naked, with only a bit of leather or cotton\r\nwound round their loins, whilst the Touaricks always furnish them with\r\nsome little clothing.\r\n\r\n_23rd._--Felt better, but weak. The excitement produced in me by my new\r\nquarters and reading the journals, after four months elapsing since I saw\r\nthe last, made all the people fancy I was already attacked with their\r\nMourzuk fever. Mr. Gagliuffi treated me as such, and the Greek doctor was\r\nsent for, who approved of my being treated as attacked, and I took\r\naccordingly fever powders. But another night's rest restored me and I\r\ndiscovered no symptoms of fever, for which I could not be too thankful,\r\nas the fever nearly attacks all strangers journeying in Mourzuk. The news\r\nfrom Europe was exceedingly disagreeable to me, inasmuch as I read of\r\ncrimes and events of a much darker shade than the things which I had seen\r\nin Desert amongst the Barbarians. The two events which arrested my\r\nattention were the massacre of five hundred French troops near Jamâ\r\nEl-Ghazouat, and the annexation of Texas, as most relating to my present\r\npursuits. The first was an evident retribution for burning alive a tribe\r\nof Arabs in the caverns of the Atlas. Some high personages in Paris\r\ndeplored this massacre of their devoted and hapless countrymen, but the\r\npoor Arabs of the Atlas, the men, women, and children burnt or suffocated\r\nalive, were unpitied and unmourned[109], because they happened to be\r\nresisting the placing of a foreign yoke on their necks. Such is the high\r\ntone of our political morality in Europe! No wonder the curse of God is\r\nupon us and afflicts us with famine and cholera! The annexation of Texas,\r\nfor the extension of slavery and the slave trade, I hope will at once and\r\nfor ever disabuse the minds of our wild democrats, who fancy that because\r\npeople call themselves republicans and establish a republican form of\r\ngovernment, therefore they are the friends of freedom. Better had America\r\nbeen bound hand and foot for ever to the aristocratic tyranny of the\r\nmother country, than that she should now become, as she is, the world's\r\npalladium of Negro slavery, and the huge breeding house of slaves to\r\nendless generations! We cannot but recommend to these trans-atlantic\r\ntramplers upon the freedom and rights of man, in defiance of all divine\r\nand human laws, the following lines of Mr. James--\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, let them look to where in bonds,\r\n      For help their bondsmen cry--\r\n    Oh, let them look, ere British hands\r\n      Wipe out that living lie.\r\n\r\n    \"Veil, starry banner, veil your pride,\r\n      The blood-red cross before--\r\n    Emblem of that by Jordan's side\r\n      Man's freedom price that bore,\r\n    No land is strong that owns a slave,\r\n    Vain is it wealthy, crafty, brave.\"\r\n\r\n    \"The slaver's boastful thirst of gain,\r\n    Tends but to break his bondsman's chain.\"\r\n\r\n_24th._--Much better in health to-day. Sent off Said, with a man of this\r\nplace, to fetch my trunk and other baggage left in The Wady. Find Mr.\r\nGagliuffi keeps up a friendly correspondence with the Vizier of the\r\nSheikh of Bornou. Any one going to Bornou would derive great advantage\r\nfrom the Vice-Consul's letters of recommendation. Mr. Gagliuffi has also\r\nconsiderable influence over the population of Fezzan, and is on good\r\nterms with the Mourzuk Bashaw.\r\n\r\n_25th._--Felt well enough to-day to call upon the Bashaw. His Highness's\r\nfull name and title is Hasan Bashaw Belazee. I was introduced to him by\r\nMr. Gagliuffi, who previously insisted upon sprucing me up a bit, and\r\nremoving my Maraboutish appearance by getting me a new red cap or _fez_.\r\nMy _Christian_ hat was left at Ghadames. It was impossible to wear it in\r\nDesert or towns, for people always said I looked like a Christian devil\r\nwhen I wore the European black hat. We found His Highness just recovered\r\nfrom a month's indisposition. He received us very politely, and Mr.\r\nGagliuffi tells me he is really a very good sort of man. His Highness\r\ngave us pipes and tea, which is becoming now a favourite beverage amongst\r\nthe Moors of East, as it has long been in West Barbary, amongst all races\r\nof the Maroquines, who have introduced the fashion of tea-drinking and\r\nteetotalism at Timbuctoo. His Highness was very talkative and affable. He\r\nwas amazed at my audacity in going amongst the Touaricks without a single\r\nletter of recommendation, and looks upon my arrival at Mourzuk as an\r\nescape from death to life. His Highness confessed, however, that the\r\nTouaricks are people of one word, and that, after having told me they\r\nwould protect me, I did right in confiding in their honour. He added, \"If\r\nyou go to Aheer hereafter I will assist you all I can.\" Mr. Gagliuffi\r\npretends the Bashaw has considerable influence amongst all the Touarghee\r\ntribes, and the Touaricks always follow strictly the recommendations\r\nwhich the Bashaw, as governor of the province of Fezzan, and a near\r\nneighbour, has taken upon himself to give them. Every person carrying a\r\nletter from His Highness to the Touaricks, has invariably been well\r\nreceived. His Highness is very fond of illustrating his conversation by\r\nsimiles, and related a little facetious palaver which he had with a\r\nTarghee of Aheer.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency thus to the Targhee:--\"You always thought there was a\r\ngreat mountain separating you from us, protecting you from our armies.\r\nYou besides always boasted of having an army of 100,000 warriors. But the\r\nother day there came to you a bee, and buzzed about your ears, and you\r\nall at once fled before the little bee. How is this? Where are your\r\n100,000 unconquerable heroes?\"\r\n\r\nThe Targhee thus to the Bashaw:--\"Ah, ah, how amazing! it was just so.\"\r\n\r\n_H. E._--\"But are you not ashamed of yourselves?\"\r\n\r\n_The Targhee._--\"Ah, ah, but we shall now go and fight them.\"\r\n\r\n_H. E._--\"Well, we shall see your courage.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bashaw explained to us, how the Touaricks of Aheer were put to flight\r\nby the Weled Suleiman, whom he the Bashaw, and his master at Tripoli,\r\nonly esteemed as so many troublesome little bees. This was the affair of\r\nthe capture of the 1000 camels, when the Touaricks were carrying off the\r\nspoils of a Tibboo village, before mentioned. These Weled Suleiman have\r\njust joined the rest of the refugees under the son of Abd-El-Geleel. The\r\nBashaw is the famous Moorish commander who captured and beheaded\r\nAbd-El-Geleel, and who has sworn to extirpate not only the family of this\r\nSheikh, but all the tribes subjected to his son. The Bashaw received the\r\nappointment of Bey or Bashaw of Fezzan, for his hatred to this family,\r\nand his services in capturing and destroying its chief. Belazee is a\r\nfresh-coloured Moor, and rather good-looking, with a dark, piercing, and\r\ncruel eye. He is about forty years of age and very stout. Of his courage\r\nthere can be no question, and his reputation as a military man is very\r\ngreat in all this part of Sahara. Mr. Gagliuffi had instructed me\r\ndiplomatically to boast of the attentions which I had received from the\r\nTouaricks, for observed the Consul, \"If you say the Touaricks did not\r\ntreat you well in every respect, the Bashaw will commiserate you before\r\nyour face, but laugh at you behind your back, and tell his people how\r\nhappy he is (and I'm sure he will be happy) you have been well fleeced by\r\nthe Touaricks, of whom the Turks here are jealous in the extreme.\" Mr.\r\nGagliuffi also volunteered a diplomatic hit of another kind on his own\r\naccount: \"My friend, your Excellency, on entering the gates of Mourzuk,\r\nand looking up at the Castle, thought he was entering a town of the dead,\r\nit looked so horribly dingy and desolate.\" I said to the Consul\r\nafterwards, \"Why did you say so?\" He replied, \"I am trying my utmost to\r\nimprove the city, and want the Bashaw to whitewash the Castle. He has\r\npromised me he will do it.\" The Bashaw addressed me, \"Think yourself\r\nlucky you have escaped, but for the future you must be placed in the\r\nhands of the Touaricks by us as a sacred deposit, and then if anything\r\nwrong happens we shall demand you of all the Touaricks by force.\" I\r\nthanked him for the compliment; I believe he meant what he said at the\r\ntime. But such an insulting message could not be delivered to the brave,\r\nchivalric, and freeborn sons of the Touarghee deserts; they would trample\r\nyour letter under their feet, or spear it with their spears.\r\n\r\nMr. Gagliuffi and myself then went to see the troops exercised. The\r\ncommanding officer is trying to reduce them to order and discipline, and\r\nsucceeds admirably. Before he arrived, great disorder reigned amongst\r\nthem, and they were constantly found intoxicated in the streets. After\r\nthe manœuvring, we visited the commander and his staff, who were all\r\nextremely polite. The Bashaw does not interfere with the discipline of\r\nthe army. The Turks can well distinguish, if they please, between civil\r\nand military affairs. And it is wrong to consider the Turkish Government\r\nand people, like Prussia and other military nations of the north, as one\r\ngreat military camp. We afterwards visited the Kady, Haj Mohammed Ben\r\nAbd-Deen, an intimate friend of the Consul. He had under his care the\r\nDenham and Clapperton caravan, and is well acquainted with us English. I\r\nwas surprised to find the Kady quite black, although his features were\r\nnot altogether Negro. Mr. Gagliuffi says Mourzuk is the first Negro\r\ncountry. This statement, however, involves a very difficult question.\r\nFezzan, Ghat, and other oases, contain many families of free Negroes,\r\nsome perhaps settled formerly as merchants, and others the descendants of\r\nfreed slaves. I do not think the real black population begins until we\r\nreach the Tibboos, although Ghatroun is mostly inhabited by Negroes.\r\nCertainly, the Negroes have never emigrated farther north in colonies.\r\nMr. Gagliuffi has just received by the courier from Tripoli, several\r\nwatches sent there for repair, belonging to the Sheikh of Bornou. They\r\nwere given to the Sheikh by our Bornou expedition, twenty years ago. It\r\nis pleasing to see with what care the watches have been preserved in\r\nCentral Africa, for they looked as good as new.\r\n\r\n_26th._--I must now consider myself recovered from indisposition. At\r\nfirst, people talked so much about Mourzuk fever that I thought I\r\nmust have it as a matter of course, and felt some disappointment at\r\nits not attacking me. Three-fourths of the Europeans who come here\r\ninvariably have the fever. I speak of the Turks. It attacks them\r\nprincipally in the beginning of the hot, and cold, weather, or in\r\nMay and November. Fortunately, I am here in February. Mourzuk\r\nis emphatically called, like many places of Africa, _Blad\r\nElhemah_--‮بلاد الحمة‬--\"country of fever.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the Christian and European curiosities and antiquities which I\r\nhave discovered in this Mussulman and Saharan city, is the following\r\npoetical scrap, published by myself, some four or five years ago, upon\r\nthat beautiful rock of Malta, or, according to the Maltese, _Fior del\r\nMondo_, \"The flower of the world.\"\r\n\r\nSONNET.\r\n\r\n    \"Hail, verdant groves! where joy's extatic power\r\n      Once gave the sultry noon a charm divine,\r\n      Excelling all that Phœbus or the Nine\r\n    Have told in glowing verse!--Youth's radiant hour\r\n      Yet beams upon my soul,--while memory true\r\n      Retraces all the past, and brings to view\r\n    The magic pleasures which these groves have known,\r\n      When Hope and Love, and Life itself, were new,\r\n    Delights which touch the SOUL OF TASTE alone,\r\n      Taught by the many and reserved for few!\r\n    O! busy _Memory_, thou hast touched a chord\r\n    Recalling images, beloved,--adored,--\r\n      While Fancy keen still wields her knife and fork,\r\n      O'er roasted turkey and a chine of pork!\"\r\n                                            CLEMENTINA.\r\n\r\nI found it flying about in one of Mr. Gagliuffi's old lumber rooms, and,\r\nbeing such a precious gem, I must needs reproduce it upon the page of my\r\ntravels. Who is the author, and how I came by it, I cannot now tell. I\r\nonly know it once adorned the columns of the \"Malta Times,\" at a period\r\nwhich now seems to me an age ago.\r\n\r\nThere was a wedding to-day, and the bride was carried on the back of the\r\ncamel, attended with the high honour of the frequent discharge of\r\nmusketry. In order that I might likewise partake of these honours, the\r\nArab cavaliers stopped before the Consul's house, and several times\r\ndischarged their matchlocks. It was a gay, busy, bustling scene. The\r\ncavaliers afterwards proceeded to the Castle, and discharged their\r\nmatchlocks, standing up on the shovel-stirrups, and firing them off at\r\nfull gallop. But these cavaliers are nothing comparable to the crack\r\nhorsemen of Morocco. Their horses are in a miserable condition, and they\r\nthemselves ride badly. The horse does not do well in the Saharan oases.\r\nIn Fezzan he is often obliged to be fed on dates, which are both heating\r\nand relaxing to the animal. Meanwhile the discharge of musketry was\r\nrattling about the city, the lady sat with the most exemplary patience on\r\nthe camel (covered up, of course), in a sort of triumphal car. A troop of\r\nfemales were at the heels of the animal loo-looing. The ceremony stirred\r\nup the phlegm of the Turks, and delighted the Arabs.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I visited one of the gardens in the suburbs. The corn was\r\nin the ear on this, the 26th day of February. In a fortnight more they\r\nwill cease their irrigation, and it will be reaped quickly afterwards. We\r\ngathered some young green peas. The flax plant is here cultivated; the\r\nfibres and dried leaves are burnt, and the seed is eaten; no other use is\r\nmade of it. Two crops of everything are obtained in the year, one now, in\r\nthe spring, and the other in autumn. The irrigation by which all this\r\ncultivation is produced, rain rarely ever falling, cannot be carried on\r\nduring the intense and absorbing heats of summer. A couple of asses and a\r\ncouple of men, or a man and a boy, do all the business of irrigation.\r\nFezzan water is brackish generally, and the wells are about fifteen of\r\ntwenty feet deep. These are in the form of great holes or pits. The more\r\ndistant suburbs present beautiful forests of palms, producing a fine\r\nreviving effect upon an eye like mine, long saddened by the ungrateful\r\naspect of a dreary desert. The atmosphere and ambient air is less\r\npleasing to view, presenting always a light dirty red hue, as if\r\nencharged with the fine sand rising from the surface. The soil of the\r\nFezzan oases is indeed mostly arenose, and the dates are nearly all\r\nimpregnated with fine particles of sand, which takes place when they are\r\nripe, and very much lowers their value. But this sandy soil does not\r\nsufficiently account for the eternal dirty vermilion hue of the\r\natmosphere of Mourzuk. They say its site is very low, in the shallow of a\r\nplain, and to this cause they attribute its fever.\r\n\r\n_27th._--Health quite restored, and got up early. There are two or three\r\nround holes in the window-shutters of my bed-room; by the assistance of\r\nthese, when the shutters are closed, in the way of a camera oscura, all\r\nthe objects passing and repassing in the streets are most sharply and\r\nartistically drawn on the opposite wall. Here beautifully delineated I\r\nsee the camels pass slowly along,--the ostriches picking and billing\r\nabout, which are the scavengers of the street, instead of the pigs at\r\nWashington, (see Dickens,) and the dogs of Constantinople, (see all the\r\ntourists,)--the women fetching water,--the lounging soldiers limping by\r\nwith their black thick shoes pulled on as slippers,--the slaves squatting\r\nin circles, playing in the dirt,--groups of merchants, black, yellow, and\r\nbrown, bargaining and wrangling,--asses laden with wood,--the\r\ncoffee-maker carrying about cups of coffee, &c., &c. Wrote letters for\r\nto-morrow's post, and very disagreeable to me, as announcing my tour\r\nbroken up midway.\r\n\r\n_28th._--Post-day. The courier leaves every Saturday, but it requires\r\nnearly forty days to get the answer of a letter from Tripoli. The courier\r\nis eighteen days _en route_. A caravan occupies from twenty-four to\r\nthirty days. In the route of Sockna there is water nearly every day, but\r\none or two places, the longest space three and a half, and four days. The\r\nCommander visited me again this morning, as also the Greek doctor, who\r\ncalls every morning. The Major now came in. He is a young Circassian; by\r\nbirth a Christian, but kidnapped and sold to the Turks. He is a very\r\namiable young man, and deeply regrets that he was not brought up a\r\nChristian. It is high time this infamous practice of selling the\r\nChristians of the East to the Turks, was put a stop to. It is to be hoped\r\nthat Russia will atone for the wrongs which she has inflicted upon\r\nPoland, and offer some compensation for the blood which she is still\r\nshedding in Circassia, by abolishing this odious system of Christian\r\nslavery through all south-eastern Europe, as in western Asia.\r\nNotwithstanding our hatred to Russia's system, and its iron-souled Grand\r\nCouncil, we Englishmen (I presume to speak for all), are willing and\r\nhappy to do justice to Russia in the efforts which she made, and the aid\r\nshe rendered the Servians, in emancipating them from the galling yoke of\r\nMussulman bigotry and Turkish tyranny[110]. Nicholas has a noble and\r\nmighty mission before him, not to subjugate Turkey, or infringe upon the\r\nliberties of Europe, but to civilize his vast empire, and the wild\r\ncountries of Northern Asia. But the Czar does not seem to understand his\r\ndestiny--or the task, more probably, is beyond his power. It must be left\r\nto his successor, or happier times. This Circassian tells me he has not\r\nhad the fever in Mourzuk. He thinks the city healthier than formerly, and\r\nattributes the fever to people's eating dates, and their bad living.\r\nDates are not only the principal growth of the Fezzan oases, but the main\r\nsubsistence of their inhabitants. All live on dates; men, women and\r\nchildren, horses, asses and camels, and sheep, fowls and dogs.\r\n\r\nMr. Gagliuffi gives the following statistics of the slave-traffic _viâ_\r\nMourzuk from Bornou and Soudan:--\r\n\r\nIn 1843       2,200\r\nIn 1844       1,200\r\nIn 1845       1,100\r\n              -----\r\n       Total, 4,500\r\n\r\nThe two last years shows a diminution, and he thinks the trade to be on\r\nthe decline. But this evidently arises from the Bornouese caravan being\r\nintercepted, or the traffic interrupted by the fugitive Arabs on the\r\nroute. There has been no large caravan from Bornou for three years. And\r\nMr. Gagliuffi considers the route at the present, so unsafe, as\r\npositively to refuse countenancing my going up to Bornou this spring.\r\nHowever, a couple of small slave-caravans have ventured stealthily down\r\ntwice a year, conducted by Tibboos. The principal Tripoline slave-dealers\r\nwho frequent Mourzuk are from Bengazi and Egypt. Slaves are besides\r\nbrought occasionally from Wadai; and there is a biennial caravan from\r\nWadai to Bengazi direct, leading to the coast a thousand and more slaves\r\nat once. Our Consul is frequently employed in administering medicine to\r\nthe poor slaves, who arrive at Mourzuk from the interior, with their\r\nhealth broken down, and often at death's door. He makes frequent cures,\r\nbut, alas! it is for the benefit of the ferocious Tibboo slave-dealer.\r\nThe Consul naturally laments he cannot buy these miserable slaves, who,\r\nin this state of disease, are often offered at the market for five or six\r\ndollars each. He has no funds at his disposal, or he would procure them\r\nby some means, cure them, and give them their liberty.\r\n\r\nThis evening I called upon a Moor, an ancient renegade of the name of\r\nYousef, who was well acquainted with all our countrymen of the Bornou\r\nexpedition. His arm was set, after being broken, by Dr. Oudney, which he\r\nstill exhibits as an old reminiscence of the doctor. Yousef has lately\r\ngiven great disgust to his good neighbours, by purchasing a new concubine\r\nslave, to whom he introduced us, notwithstanding that he has his house\r\nfull of women and children. This sufficiently proves that Mohammedans\r\ndiscountenance the unbridled licence of filling their houses with women.\r\nOne of his old female slaves, by whom Yousef has had several children,\r\nsaid to Mr. Gagliuffi, \"I won't speak to you any more, Consul. Don't come\r\nmore to this house. Why did you give my master money to buy a new slave?\"\r\nThe Consul protested he did not. Old Yousef laughed, and drily\r\nobserved:--\"When this (pointing to the new slave), is in the family way,\r\nI must purchase another wife. If I can't keep my wives myself, I must beg\r\nof my neighbours to contribute a portion of the necessary expense.\" Old\r\nYousef is a thorough-going scamp of a Moor.\r\n\r\n_1st March._--Occupied in writing down the stations of the Bornou route\r\nfrom the mouth of one of the Sheikh's couriers. There are now two of\r\nthese couriers in Mourzuk, natives of Bornou. The Sheikh corresponds with\r\nBelazee as well as with Mr. Gagliuffi. Bornouese couriers travel in\r\npairs, lest a single one should fail if sent alone. They are mounted on\r\ncamels, and it requires them forty days to make the traverse from Mourzuk\r\nto Bornou. I tired the courier pretty well with dictating to me the\r\nroute. It is extremely difficult to get an African to sit down quietly\r\nand attentively an hour, and give you information. If ever so well paid,\r\nthey show the greatest impatience. Afterwards paid a visit to the young\r\nCircassian officer. He related to me how he was captured. It was in the\r\nbroad day, when he was quite a child, playing by a little brook, and\r\npicking up stones to throw in the water. The officer says, that in his\r\ndreams, he often sees the silvery bubbles and rings of the water rising\r\nafter he had thrown the pebble into the brook; and, especially, does he\r\nsee the ever-flown visions of his green and flowery pastimes of\r\nchildhood, whilst he is out on duty in the open and thirsty desert, lying\r\ndozing under an intense sun, darting its beams of fire on his head. The\r\nkidnapper took him to Constantinople. His brother came up after to rescue\r\nhim. But the master, to whom he was sold, terrified him, by threatening,\r\nif he should show the least wish to return, to cut him to pieces. The\r\nbarbarous threat had its desired effect, and he submitted to his fate.\r\nThis Circassian officer has still a hankering after Christians, and in\r\nhis heart is no good Mussulman. He tries to adopt as much as possible\r\nChristian manners, and boasts of having all things like them. Such forced\r\nrenegades deserve our most sincere sympathies.\r\n\r\nEvening--Mr. Gagliuffi and myself dined with the Greek doctor. It was a\r\ncarnival day with the doctor, and he prepared a befitting entertainment.\r\nAn Albanian Greek dined with us, who had been brought up from Tripoli by\r\nAbd-El-Geleel, to make gunpowder for the Arab prince. When the Turks\r\ncaptured Mourzuk they found here the Albanian. He has nearly lost his\r\nsight, and is now charitably supported by the Doctor. We were waited upon\r\nby the Doctor's servant, an Ionian Greek, and the Maltese servant of the\r\nConsul, and so mustered six Christians, a large number for the interior\r\nof Africa. The dinner was magnificently sumptuous for this part of\r\nAfrica. We had a whole lamb roasted. After dinner, its shoulder bones\r\nwere clean scraped and held up to the light by the Doctor, in order to\r\ncatch a glimpse of the dark future! This is an ancient superstition of\r\nthe Greeks. Besides several Turkish dishes, (for the Doctor lives half\r\nTurk, half Christian,) we had salmon and Sardinians. This was the first\r\npiece of fish I had seen or eaten for seven months. It was remarked when\r\nthe large caravan from Bornou comes, expected in this summer, it will\r\ncertainly bring dried fish from the Lake Tschad. In Central Africa, they\r\ndry fish, as meat, without salt, and it keeps well. We had bottled stout,\r\ntable wines, Malaga, rosatas, and rum. We were all of course very happy,\r\nand the Albanian sang several of his wild mountain songs. He was very\r\nmerry, and, swore he was obliged to keep himself merry, because, not\r\nlike other people, he had an affair which rankled in his breast. We asked\r\nhim what it was. The Albanian answered, greatly excited, both with his\r\nwine and his subject, \"A man killed my brother, and I have not yet been\r\nable to kill him. The vengeance of my brother's blood torments me night\r\nand day. I pray God to return to my country to kill the murderer.\" This\r\nAlbanian is an enthusiastic Greek, and wishes and prays to see his\r\ncountrymen plant again the Cross on the dome of St. Sophia. \"But many of\r\nyou have turned Turk,\" I remarked. \"Yes,\" observed the Albanian, \"many of\r\nmy countrymen have turned Turk, and I, who am less than the least of them\r\nall, I have not committed this folly. I can't comprehend how they could\r\nso trample on the name of their Saviour.\" In short, I found the Albanian\r\npossessed of all the fire, bigotry, ferocity and vindictiveness, for\r\nwhich his countrymen are so celebrated. I encouraged him, and said, \"The\r\nGreek kingdom ought to have its bounds a little widened.\" The Greek\r\njumped up wildly at this remark, and clenching my hand, began screaming\r\none of his patriotic airs, and cursing the Turks, so that we became all\r\nat once a seditious dinner-party, under the shade of the pale Crescent.\r\nHad we been in Paris, that pinnacle of liberty and civilization, we\r\nshould all immediately have been conveyed off, without finishing our\r\ndessert and the wine which made us such patriot Greeks, to the sobering\r\napartment of the Conciergerie. Happily we were in The Desert, under the\r\nrule of barbarians. Coletti was mentioned, but I forget what was said of\r\nhim. In Jerbah, a Greek merchant protested to me, that the only way to\r\nregenerate Greece was to cut off the head of this Coletti, as well as\r\nall the present chiefs of parties. He observed \"Another generation alone\r\ncan regenerate Greece.\" The merchant added, \"I should like also to hang\r\nup that Monsieur Piscatory.\"\r\n\r\nIt does seem a pity that diplomacy should be reduced to the most\r\ndetestable intrigues, lying and duplicity, which if any other class of\r\nmen were guilty of, they would be put out of the pale of society. But\r\nmankind would care little about these archpriests of falsehood, were it\r\nnot for the serious consequences resulting from their works. Look at the\r\nstate of Greece now, the handicraft of diplomatists! Such is the result\r\nof the good and friendly offices rendered to an infant state by these\r\nsons of the Father of Lies!\r\n\r\nAt this time there are some nine hundred Albanians in Tripoli, regular\r\ntroops of the Porte, whose only occupation is lounging, lying and smoking\r\nabout the streets. There were sixty or seventy Christians amongst them,\r\nbut for some reason or other unexplained, the Bashaw sent them all back.\r\nThe report is, the Sultan does not know what to do with these Albanians,\r\nand has sent them to Africa to decimate them. The massacreing Janissary\r\ndays are past, and we have arrived at an age of the more humane policy of\r\nletting them die of fever on the burning plains of Africa. Perhaps France\r\nhas recommended the Porte this policy, having found it answer so well in\r\nthe experiment made on malcontent regiments in Algeria. How very humane\r\nall our European Governments are getting! How kindly they treat their\r\npoor troops! Who would not be a soldier, and fight the battles of\r\n\"glorious war?\" But we must return to our host, who is a very different\r\nkind of Greek. Doctors are always pacific men. The Doctor observed\r\nlaconically, \"I eat the bread of the Turks, and whilst I do so I must be,\r\nand I am a good Ottoman subject.\" Mr. Gagliuffi speaks Greek and Turkish\r\nbesides Arabic and Italian, and so he is at home with all these people.\r\nIt is happy for the Consul he does, for after all, Mourzuk is but a\r\nmiserable dirty place, and would kill with ennui, if fever were wanting,\r\nsome score of English Vice-Consuls.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--The Consul received a visit from the Adjutant-Major, Agha\r\nSuleman. The Doctor came in and was very merry with the Adjutant, who is\r\nalways trying to get himself reported sick, in order that he may return\r\nto Tripoli. The Adjutant observed to me, whilst he drew himself up, made\r\na wry face, and heaved a deep sigh, as if his last, to persuade the\r\nDoctor he was greatly suffering, \"I would not go to Bornou if you were to\r\ngive me 100,000 dollars.\" But why should he? With what sort of feeling\r\ncould he go there? The spirit of discovery, which once stirred up the\r\nArabian savans to explore Nigritia, is now totally extinct both in Arabs\r\nand Turks. I learnt some items of the pay of Officials in Mourzuk. The\r\nBashaw has 5,000 mahboubs per annum. The Adjutant-Major has 30 dollars\r\nper mensem; the Doctor 25 dollars; and so on of the rest, the commanding\r\nofficer having perhaps 50 dollars per mensem. This amount of pay is\r\nconsidered sufficient for expenses at Mourzuk. The officers have quarters\r\nwith the Bashaw in the Castle. Mr. Gagliuffi related a characteristic\r\nanecdote of the ignorance prevailing amongst the Arabs as gross as that\r\nof Negroes. Mohammed Circus (or the Circassian) was a few years ago\r\nBashaw of Bengazi whilst Mr. G. visited that place. The Bashaw was buying\r\nsomething of an Arab, and gave him but a third of its real value. Mr. G.\r\ntook upon himself to say, \"Why do you injure this poor man by giving him\r\nbut a third of the value of his goods?\" \"Oh!\" rejoined the Bashaw, \"that\r\nis not a man, he is only a dog. Let me call him back and you shall see\r\nwhat he is.\" Immediately the Bashaw called the man back and asked him,\r\n\"Who was the better, God or Mahomet?\" The Arab bluntly answered, smiling\r\nwith conceit, \"Why do you ask me such a thing? What harm do I receive\r\nfrom Mahomet or what harm do others receive from our prophet? But God\r\nkills one man with a sword, hangs another, drowns another. All the evil\r\nof the world is from God, but Mahomet does nothing except good for us.\"\r\n\r\nThis poor ignorant fellow was filled with ideas of irresistible fate.\r\nSome Arabs and Moors ascribe only the good things to God, whilst others\r\nall things, the evil and the good. When this anecdote was being ended, a\r\nMoor came in, and being in a disputing humour, I asked him abruptly,--\r\n\r\n\"What is truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Koran.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who told you the Koran is truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mahomet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who told Mahomet?\"\r\n\r\n\"God.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mahomet says so.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did Mahomet do to make you credit his word?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"What things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed the infidels, sent us the camel into Africa, planted for us the\r\ndate-palm, and worked many wonders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, great many more things I cannot now recollect.\"\r\n\r\nThe camel, I think, was introduced into Africa about the third century.\r\nIt is a mistake to say, Mahomet did no miracles. The people in North\r\nAfrica and The Desert all relate miracles performed by Mahomet. The\r\nProphet, however, repudiates miracles in the Koran. In Surats xiii. and\r\nxvii., in answer to miracles demanded, the Prophet replies by the\r\nknock-down argument, \"All miracles are vain. Whom God directs, believes;\r\nwhom he causes to err, errs.\" Our conversation passed to old Yousef\r\nBashaw, whose family the Porte has deposed. Mr. Gagliuffi observed\r\njustly, and which so often happens in despotic countries, \"Yousef\r\nestablished Tripoli and its provinces in one firm united kingdom, and in\r\nthe early part of his life his power was respected and his people happy;\r\nbut as the Bashaw declined in life, he again disorganized everything, and\r\nTripoli was rent in pieces.\" Went to visit a member of the Divan. All\r\nthese despotic Bashaws consult or prompt a mute Divan. Let us hope the\r\nConsulta lately assembled by Pius IX. will turn out something better than\r\nthese mute Divans, or a Buonaparte Senate. We were treated with coffee,\r\nand milk, sour milk (or leben), but not skimmed, which is considered a\r\ngreat luxury, and only presented to strangers of consequence.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--We received a visit from the Bey, as he is sometimes called, the\r\ncommander of the troops, who is a very sociable kind-hearted little\r\nfellow. Mr. Gagliuffi related some of the atrocities which were committed\r\nby the troops previous to the commander's arrival. They killed a woman,\r\ncommitted rape on a child, were never sober, and always quarrelling with\r\nthe inhabitants. They are now reduced to discipline and order. One day\r\nMohammed Effendi said to Mr. Gagliuffi, \"I am always at work, either\r\nmaking improvements in the town or exercising the troops, but who sees me\r\nhere, no one recognizes my conduct in The Desert.\" The Consul endeavoured\r\nto console the desponding officer by observing, God saw him, and one day\r\nwould reward him for his good works. So we see, the Turks are a part of\r\nthe human race after all, and could lead on their fellow-creatures in the\r\nway of improvement if their energies were properly directed. Africa could\r\nbe greatly benefitted by the Turks. Even at Mourzuk they are introducing\r\nthings which will soon be imitated at Bornou. Not being infidels, the\r\nsame objection does not exist against their innovations as against us\r\nChristians. Even in the little matter of gloves I saw an immense\r\ndifference. The officers here wear gloves, and nothing is thought of it.\r\nPeople do not say to them as they have said to me at Ghat and Ghadames,\r\n\"You have the devil's hands.\" Mohammed Effendi actually went so far as to\r\nmake this speech, \"I shall go to England one day in order that I may\r\nlearn something.\" The grand occupation of the Commander now is, the\r\nbuilding of a guard-house within the city. This occupies his attention\r\nmorning, noon, and night; and it certainly has a good appearance. There\r\nis not such a natty thing in Tripoli. The officer directs all the works,\r\nand is assisted occasionally by the friendly counsel of the Consul; so\r\nthat a wonder of architecture will at last be reared amidst the\r\ncrumbling-down places of this city of hovels.\r\n\r\nMy Said returned this afternoon, bringing the baggage from The Wady. Five\r\nmore slaves of Haj Ibrahim are sick. His first slave adventure at Ghat is\r\nlikely to turn out a bad speculation. Read an article or two from\r\n_Blackwood's Magazine_, No. CCXXX. The Consul has got a few stray numbers\r\nup The Desert. English politics read all stuff in Desert, like what a\r\ncelebrated man was accustomed to say of his philosophy after dinner,\r\n\"It's all nonsense or worse.\" So is reading English politics in this part\r\nof the world. How soon our tastes and passions change, with our change of\r\nplace, and scene, and skies! An Englishman married a Malay woman at\r\nSingapore. In six years he lost all his English, nay, European feelings,\r\nand became as listless and stupid as the people whose habits and\r\nnationality he had sunken under.\r\n\r\nVisited this evening the grave of Mr. Ritchie, who died at Mourzuk on\r\nNovember 20, 1819. He was buried by Capt. Lyon, his companion in African\r\ntravel. The grave is placed about two hundred yards south of the Moorish\r\nburying-ground; it is raised eight or ten inches above the level of the\r\nsoil, and is large, being edged round with a border of clay and small\r\nstones. We were conducted by old Yousef, who told us the Rais (Capt.\r\nLyon) chose the site of burial between three small mounds of earth, in\r\norder that the grave might be easily distinguished hereafter. Mr.\r\nGagliuffi, had never visited the grave before my arrival, which I\r\nproposed to him as a sacred duty that we owed to our predecessors in\r\nAfrican travel and discovery. The Consul promises now to have the grave\r\nrepaired and white-washed, and I, on my part, promise, in the event of my\r\nreturn to the interior, to carry with me a small tombstone, to place over\r\nthe grave, with name, date, and epitaph. If there were a thorough and\r\n_bonâ fide_ Geographical Society in England, this little attention to the\r\nmemory of that distinguished man of science would have been performed\r\nlong ago. But our societies are instituted to pay their officers and\r\nsecretaries, and not to promote the objects for which they are ostensibly\r\nsupported by the public. The Moorish cemetery close by, is a most\r\nmelancholy, nay, frightfully grotesque picture. No white-shining tombs\r\nand dome-topped mausoleums, no dark cypresses waving over them and\r\ncontrasting shade with light, which mournfully adorn the cemeteries of\r\nthe north coast. All is the grotesque refuse of misery! Here we see\r\nsticks of palm-branches driven down at the head of the graves, which\r\nsticks are driven through old bottles, pitchers, jugs, ostrich eggs, &c.,\r\nso that at a distance the burying-ground has the appearance of a dull,\r\ndirty, desolate field of household rubbish, and old crockery-ware. I did\r\nnot trouble myself to ask the reason of this trumpery of trumperies, but\r\nI imagine it is to distinguish one grave from another. The cemetery of\r\nGhadames, where nothing is seen but stones, if it be a desert-looking\r\nplace, yet has not this trumpery appearance. I was glad to see the grave\r\nof Ritchie lying apart from this, though in its infidel isolation. There\r\nlies our poor countryman, alone in The Sahara! But, though without a\r\nstone or monument to mark the desert spot, still it is a memorial of the\r\ngenius and enterprise of Englishmen for travel and research in the\r\nwildest, remotest regions of the globe. And, for myself, I would rather\r\nlie here, in open desert, than in the crowded London churchyard, amidst\r\nsmoke, and filth, and resurrectionists, the pride and glory of our\r\nCockney-land. Here, at least, the body rests in purity, the desert\r\nbreeze, which sweeps its \"dread abode\" barer and barer, is not\r\ncontaminated with the effluvia of a death-dealing pestilence; and though\r\nthe ardent sun of Africa smites continually the lonely grave, the bones\r\nmayhap will rest undisturbed till reunited and refleshed at the loud call\r\nof the Trump of Doom! unkennelled, uncoffined by wild beast, or more\r\nferocious man.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[108] Although Mr. Gagliuffi is an Austrian, a native of Trieste,\r\n    he has acquired all the English ideas of comfort, and speaks\r\n    excellent English.\r\n\r\n[109] As a remarkable exception, some one or two _French_ papers\r\n    did protest against this wholesale burning alive of an Arab tribe.\r\n\r\n[110] See Mrs. Kerr's translation of the History of Servia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nRESIDENCE AT MOURZUK.\r\n\r\n     Mr. Gagliuffi's opinion of the Touaricks.--Amazonian\r\n     White-Washers.--Visit, and take leave of the Bashaw.--Various\r\n     Anecdotes related by His Highness.--Safe-conduct given to\r\n     liberated Slaves in returning to their Country.--Character of the\r\n     Tibboos, and particularly Tibboo Women.--Description of the Oases\r\n     of Fezzan.--Leo's Account of these Oases.--Recent History of the\r\n     Government of Mourzuk.--The Traitor Mukni.--Life and Character of\r\n     Abd-el-Geleel.--The Civil War in Tripoli, and Usurpation of its\r\n     Government by the Turks.--The Tyrant Asker Ali.--Skirmish of\r\n     Hasan Belazee with the Town of Omm-Errâneb, and the Oulad\r\n     Suleiman.--Retreat of the Oulad Suleiman to Bornou, and their\r\n     Marauding Character.--My departure from Mourzuk with the\r\n     Slave-Caravan of Haj Essnousee.--Establishment of British Consuls\r\n     in The Great Desert and Central Africa.--Force of the new\r\n     Slave-Caravan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_4th._--FEEL as well in health as when I left Tripoli, though housed in\r\nthis city of fever. Mr. Gagliuffi has some ideas about the Touaricks\r\nwhich I have not acquired in Ghat. He pretends Touaricks are always\r\nafraid of their women, and are obliged to do whatsoever their wives tell\r\nthem. The son never will go with his father, but always follows his\r\nmother. His father he learns to hate the more he loves his mother. The\r\nConsul does not think the Touaricks of Aheer to be so numerous as\r\nrepresented. The same, indeed, may be said of all the kingdoms of Africa.\r\nThe principal slave or servant (factotum) of the Sultan of Aheer is now\r\nin Mourzuk, transacting business for his master. The Bashaw offered to\r\nwrite to the Sultan for me through this man. He is called Hiddee, and\r\npaid me a visit this morning. En-Nour, the friend of Kandarka, is only a\r\nSheikh. Hiddee is the slave whom the Bashaw has been quizzing so severely\r\nabout the mighty armies of his master.\r\n\r\nA number of women are now occupied opposite to us in white-washing or\r\nwhite-claying the Guard-house, this _chef-d'œuvre_ of Mourzuk\r\narchitecture. The women alone do this work, and as their privilege. There\r\nare about thirty of them so occupied, under the command of a queen\r\nwhite-washer. They all tremble at the sound of her Majesty's voice.\r\nSometimes she gives them a crack over the head with a bowl, to make them\r\nlook sharp about them. The white-washers prepare the wash in the usual\r\nway, and then lade it out in small bowls, throwing a whole bowl at once\r\nat the walls, using no brush, now and then only with their hands rubbing\r\nover a place not wet with the wash. This arises from the nature of the\r\nwash, it being merely a fine brown-white clay, or a species of pipe-clay.\r\nThere is no lime in the oases near: people fetch it from Sockna. For this\r\nreason the Castle is so dirty. There is attendant on the women a band of\r\nArab musicians, to cheer them on in their work. Every man who passes by\r\ngets a piece of white-wash clay thrown at him. If it hits him he has to\r\npay, if not he escapes. On his non-payment, when so hit, he is tabooed\r\nfrom the privileges which he possesses in and over women. He can have no\r\ncommunication with them, nor can he buy anything from them, or receive\r\nanything from their hands. If he does not pay in a few days, his fine\r\nincreases with his delay. This custom prevails, and its stipulations are\r\nmost religiously binding, whenever women are employed to white-wash\r\nGovernment houses and establishments. Once a Targhee received some money,\r\nwhich a woman thus employed offered to him, to entrap him. Immediately\r\nexclaimed the virago, \"You cowardly rascal, instead of giving us money,\r\nyou take money away from us.\" Then a mob of these Amazons followed him to\r\nhis house, and, to save himself from being torn and scratched to pieces\r\nby the troop, he paid ten dollars, and was happy to escape so easily. The\r\nAmazonian white-washers like to have a shy at Mr. Gagliuffi or the\r\nDoctor, because they are down upon them for a good mulct or present. To\r\nsave their respective dignities, Consul and Doctor take care to keep out\r\nof that quarter of the town where the work of the Amazons is going on.\r\n\r\nWe paid a visit to the Bashaw this afternoon previous to my departure\r\nto-morrow. We had tea and pipes again as before. His Highness was\r\nexcessively civil, and related to me many anecdotes of the people of this\r\npart of the world, of which anecdotes and such chit-chat he is very fond.\r\nThis Bashaw is a sort of chronicler of the Arabian Nights order, with the\r\ndifference, that what His Highness relates are generally true stories.\r\nMr. Gagliuffi instructed me in a little of his Desert diplomacy, and I\r\naccordingly observed, \"Your Excellency must extend the Turkish rule in\r\nSahara, and you ought to capture Ghat, for that is the centre of commerce\r\nin these parts.\" This was put forth as a feeler. The Bashaw deigned the\r\nfollowing in reply:--\"There was a boy left with his father, whilst the\r\nmother and wife had gone to a neighbouring village on an errand. The boy,\r\nafter a sleep of three hours, awoke, and, looking about him and not\r\nseeing his mother, began to cry for her. 'Oh,' said the father, 'you\r\nhave begun to cry for your mother after three minutes, you blubbering\r\nurchin; whilst I have been waiting for my wife, with the most enduring\r\npatience, these three long hours.\"--\"So it is with me,\" continued the\r\nBashaw; \"you are crying for Ghat after three months' residence here, and\r\nI have been crying for Ghat these three long years. I have been waiting\r\nevery year, every month and day in the year, to go and take it, or\r\ndestroy it, but the Sultan sends me no orders.\" I noticed the Fullan boy\r\nof the Bashaw, and observed to him that I had seen very few of the Fullan\r\nslaves. The Bashaw returned, \"That boy is gold to me. When I was sick, he\r\nwas the only one who waited upon me unceasingly, and never left my couch.\r\nI have also a Fullan girl; her hair is as long as your women's, and\r\nreaches down to her waist.\" Mr. Gagliuffi afterwards told me His Highness\r\nhad been some while choosing a wife, that is, a substitute for his wife\r\nwho is in Tripoli, and had at last found what he liked in this Fullan\r\ngirl, of whose beauty and grace he said the Bashaw boasted to him (the\r\nConsul), a thing quite unusual amongst Mohammedans. The features of this\r\nFullan boy were very regular, black eyes and a light olive complexion.\r\nSuch were Fullan slaves of our caravan; and the most _recherchée_ of all\r\nthe females, fetching the highest price, was a Fullanah girl.\r\n\r\nHis Highness related several anecdotes of the Soudanese people. Slaves\r\nare told, on leaving Soudan, that white people will kill them and eat\r\nthem; but when they get here, and see themselves kindly treated, they\r\nbecome reconciled to slavery. In some of the Nigritian countries, when\r\nthe people get old,--say seventy or eighty years of age,--their\r\nrelatives and friends say to them, \"Come, now you are very old, and are\r\nof no use in the world: it is better for you to go away to your fathers\r\nand to the gods. There you will be young again, eat and drink as well as\r\never, and be as beautiful and as strong as you ever were or can be. You\r\nwill renew your young days like the young birds, and the young lions.\"\r\n\"Very well,\" reply the aged decrepid creatures, \"we will go.\" They then\r\ndress up their aged worn-out victim in his fine clothing, and make a\r\nfeast. When in the midst of drums and horrible screams, during the height\r\nof the feast, they lay hold of the old man, and throw him into a large\r\nfire, and he is immediately consumed to ashes. The Bashaw did not\r\nparticularize the country, but this barbarous rite has been witnessed in\r\nother parts of the world besides Africa.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Wadai are a nation of drunkards. They can do nothing\r\nunless drunk. Amongst these people, the greatest mark of friendship is to\r\npresent their friends with raw meat, with the bile of the liver poured on\r\nit as sauce or gravy. Wadai is in the neighbourhood of Upper Egypt and\r\nAbyssinia, and the tale reminds one of Bruce, and the live-meat eating\r\nAbyssinians. A Tibboo chief came to Mourzuk, and presented himself\r\nwithout introduction before His Highness, and thus harangued him:--\"Oh\r\nBey! I want to write to my son, the Bashaw of Tripoli. You must send my\r\nletter to my son.\" \"Give it to me,\" said His Highness, most\r\ncondescendingly. \"There it is,\" cried the Tibboo, and flung it down at\r\nthe feet of the Governor. The letter being opened, the contents ran\r\nthus:--\"Son, be a good man, fear me and fear God. If you behave well, and\r\nacknowledge me as your father, I will send you three slaves and come and\r\nsee you.\" The Tibboo was allowed to depart from the Governor as a madman.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said the Bashaw to me, \"how ignorant and presumptuous are these\r\nTibboo people.\"\r\n\r\nI replied, \"It was always so that ignorance and pride went together, and\r\nit always will be so.\"\r\n\r\n_His Highness._--\"Are your people so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, all the world is so.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bashaw now came to the Touaricks. \"The Touaricks detest cities. When\r\nthey visit us, we cannot make them sleep within the walls.\" I observed,\r\nthey have not confidence in the people of the towns they visit. The\r\nBashaw thought that was a hit at him, and so it was, for the Touaricks\r\nsleep within the walls of their own cities, and even inside Ghadames. I\r\noccupied a house which they had tenanted just before my arrival.\r\nTherefore His Highness jumped from the Touaricks to the\r\nGhadamseeah:--\"The Ghadamsee people are a nation of Jews. I once had to\r\nescort them. One morning when I got up I found them all in separate\r\ngroups, for they detest each other's society. (The Bashaw might have\r\nobserved the separation of the two hereditary factions.) They were all in\r\ndisorder. I got a whip and laid it on them one after another, as they\r\nwhip their slaves. The next morning they were all ready to start before I\r\nwas. This is the way to treat these Jews. The curse of God is upon them.\r\nWhen they die nothing is found in their houses, nor gold, silver, money,\r\nor goods, not even victuals. God punishes them thus because they are a\r\nnation of Jews and slave-dealers.\" Belazee forgets that his government is\r\npartly supported by the slave-traffic. But the Bashaw is a man of great\r\naudacity, takes large views of things, assumes the air of lavish and\r\nmagnificent pretensions, and hates the quiet, thrifty, and money-making\r\ncharacter of the merchants of Ghadames. The Bashaw concluded his long\r\nstring of anecdotes by asking me, on my return, to bring him a watch, but\r\nnot to bring it if I did not intend to charge him for it, for he could\r\nnot accept presents from me, since he had a fixed salary from the Sultan.\r\nHe added, \"I'm sorry you have not brought a letter from the Bashaw of\r\nTripoli, for I can't show you the attention I would wish. But bring a\r\nletter when you return, and I'll write to all the princes of Africa for\r\nyou.\" I answered, \"Oh, I'll bring you a firman from the Porte, if that\r\nwill do for you.\" At which His Highness laughed heartily.\r\n\r\nWhatever ferocity of disposition Hasan Belazee may have shown in the\r\ndecapitation of Abd-El-Geleeh, he certainly knows how to be polite and\r\nshow hospitality to strangers. The British Consul-General tried to get\r\nhim removed from Mourzuk, with the tyrant, Asker Ali, from Tripoli, but\r\nBelazee was the only man who could keep this province tranquil, and the\r\ntrade with the coast uninterrupted. Mr. Gagliuffi tells me, as a proof of\r\nthe Bashaw's influence in the interior, that His Highness wrote to the\r\nTouaricks of Aheer and Ghat to allow liberated slaves to return\r\nunmolested to their country, as an act acceptable to God, seeing the poor\r\nslaves had been liberated by their pious Mussulman masters, who invoked\r\nupon them the blessing of the Almighty on the day of their liberation.\r\nAnd it is said, that, in no case, when a freed slave took a letter from\r\nthe Bashaw, did the slave fail to reach his native country. How\r\ndifferent this Desert morality to that of the villanous Americans, who\r\nglory in recapturing freed slaves, or hanging them up by Lynch Law--and\r\nthose poor men have bought their freedom by the sweat of their brow! The\r\nBashaw is also strong amongst the Tibboos, who are generally an immoral\r\nrace of Africans. These Tibboos attacked a merchant of Tripoli and\r\nplundered him near their country. His Highness immediately clapped all\r\nthe Tibboos then at Mourzuk in prison, until the merchant's goods were\r\nrestored, and he himself brought safe to Mourzuk. Since this strong\r\nmeasure, the Tibboos have plundered no more Tripoline merchants.\r\n\r\nMr. Gagliuffi pointed out several Tibboos to me in the town, and amongst\r\nthe rest one who called himself a Sultan. This chief came the other day\r\nto the Consul and thus addressed him:--\r\n\r\n\"My wife is coming here. I'm so glad. She is such a good wife. Oh, so\r\ngood!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why is she a good wife?\" inquired the Consul.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she has killed two women; first the daughter, then the mother;\r\nwretches who wanted to kill her. Isn't that a good wife?\"\r\n\r\nThe Tibboo women secrete knives about them, as the Italian and Spanish\r\nladies conceal the stiletto in their garters. It does not come within my\r\nprovince to describe the Tibboos, but I may say briefly of the social\r\ncondition of those tribes, in that country it is \"Man and his Mistress,\"\r\nand not \"Woman and her Master.\" The Tibboo ladies do not even allow a\r\nhusband to enter his own home without sending word previously to announce\r\nhimself. A Tibboo lady once explained this matter in Mourzuk. \"Why,\"\r\nsaid the Tibbooess, \"should I not have two or three husbands, as well as\r\nmy husband two or three wives? Are not we women as good as men? Of\r\ncourse, I don't wish my husband to surprise me enjoying myself with my\r\nlovers.\" It is a notorious fact, that when the salt caravans go from\r\nAheer to Bilma, the whole villages are cleared of the men, the Tibboo men\r\nescaping to the neighbouring mountains with provisions for a month. In\r\nthe meanwhile, the Tibboo women and the strangers are left to themselves.\r\nThe women transact all the trade of salt, and manage alone their\r\nhousehold affairs. The Tibboo women, indeed, are everything, and their\r\nmen nothing--idling and lounging away their time, and kicked about by\r\ntheir wives as so many useless drones of society. The women maintain the\r\nmen as a race of stallions, and not from any love for them; but to\r\npreserve the Tibboo nation from extinction.\r\n\r\nA brief description of the oases of Fezzan may be given, beginning with\r\n_Mourzuk_, (‮مرزوق‬). The capital is placed in\r\n25° 54′ N. Lat., and 14° 12′ E. of Greenwich. It is a walled city,\r\ncontained within the circumference of about three miles, having a\r\npopulation of about 3,500 souls. The area of the site was reduced to\r\na third, on the south side, by Abd-El-Geleel, for the convenience of\r\ndefence, when he held it against the Turks. On the west, is the\r\nCastle of the Bashaw, forming a separate division or quarter from\r\nthe town. The Castle, which consists of many buildings and\r\ncourt-yards, contains the barracks. The town is formed of one large\r\nbroad street, opening into a spacious square before the Castle, and\r\nseveral smaller narrower streets. Since the occupation of the Turks,\r\nmany improvements have been made. A new mosque has been built, and\r\na guard-house is being finished for the troops in town. Two or three\r\ncoffee-houses and new shops have been fitted up, and the progress of\r\nbuilding improvements continues. Mourzuk has three gates. The houses\r\nare mostly built of sun-dried bricks, cemented with mud, very little\r\nstone and no lime being found in the environs. Altogether it is a\r\nclean place, for an interior African city. The suburbs already have\r\nbeen noticed, where in the gardens wheat, barley, ghusub, ghafouly,\r\nthe flax plant, common vegetables and flowers, a few roses and\r\njessamines, are cultivated, with the noble date-palm overshadowing\r\nall. Every garden has its well, or wells. Sweet water is scarce. The\r\nspring crops are six weeks in advance of those in Tripoli. The\r\nBashaw, on my taking leave of His Highness, presented me with a\r\nhandful of ripe barley to bring to Tripoli, as a rarity. One bushel\r\nor measure of seed-corn produces from twenty-four to twenty-eight\r\nbushels. A greater quantity of corn could be easily produced in all\r\nthe oases. A man and boy with an ass can cultivate corn enough in a\r\nseason to subsist three or four families during six months. There\r\nare two seasons and two crops. But the gardens near the city offer\r\nno features of beautiful vegetation. At a distance there are much\r\nfiner specimens of Saharan cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe government of Mourzuk consists of a Bashaw, ostensibly assisted by a\r\nDivan of six persons, to whom is joined the Kady. Besides a Kady in this\r\ncity, there are four Kadys in the rest of the province. The garrison\r\nconsists of five hundred and fifty men and boys, about one-third only of\r\nwhom are Turks, the rest being Arabs and Moors. Of the whole force, one\r\nhundred and fifty are cavalry. There is besides an irregular corps of a\r\nhundred Arab horse. The superior officers, including the\r\ncommander-in-chief, are all Turks. The medical officer is a Greek. The\r\nPorte has very few Turkish doctors. The medical officer at Tripoli was\r\nthe late Dickson, an Englishman. This inconsiderable force is sufficient\r\nto maintain all the oases in tranquillity, and defend them from the\r\nhostile tribes.\r\n\r\nThe commerce of Mourzuk is at a low ebb on account of the rival Touarick\r\ncity of Ghat, and especially from the disturbed state of the Bornou route\r\nduring the last few years. However, there are caravans between Cairo and\r\nMourzuk, which never frequent Tripoli. Many British and Levant goods come\r\nby this route, which are not brought by the ordinary route from Tripoli.\r\n\r\nSaharan merchants divide Central Africa or Nigritia, into three\r\ndivisions, according to the marts and routes of the interior commerce,\r\nviz.: Bornou, with which Mourzuk has the most direct relations; Soudan,\r\nor Bur-el-Abeed, (\"Land of Slaves\"), with which Ghat and Ghadames have\r\ndirect and most frequent communications; and, finally, Timbuctoo, with\r\nwhich Ghat and Ghadames have likewise always relations. But Morocco is\r\nthe country in North Africa which has the most constant relations with\r\nTimbuctoo; so much so, that in past times, the Emperors pretended to\r\nexercise sovereignty over this mysterious city of the banks of the Niger.\r\n\r\nAs before mentioned, Mourzuk is not healthy[111]. The Greek doctor calls\r\nthe fever \"_febre terziane_\" (Ital.), apparently the ordinary\r\nintermittent fever, or perhaps the tertian ague, with local\r\npeculiarities. It usually begins in April and continues all summer. It\r\nrecommences in October, and persons attacked in this month are sick\r\nduring the whole of the month. About two per cent. die if they have\r\nmedical assistance, but, without this assistance, a great number die.\r\nAfter it, comes the bile, \"_gastrica bigliosa_.\" (Ital.) This disease has\r\nalso fatal consequences. The simple fever is often accompanied, when it\r\npresents itself, with worms; it then changes to intermittent fever, and\r\nif it does not, is usually fatal. Persons not cured of the fever often\r\nbecome dropsical. There are a few cases of consumption. Syphilis is very\r\nvirulent, and prevails amongst the troops. Ophthalmia and rheumatism are\r\ncommon complaints. Thus Mourzuk is not quite one of those oases, or\r\nHesperian gardens, where the happy residents quaff the elixir of immortal\r\nhealth and virtue. Contrarily, it is a sink of vice and disease within,\r\nand a sere foliage of palms and vegetation without, overhung with an ever\r\nforbidding sky, of dull red haziness.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish system of laxity of morals, as exhibited in all their\r\ngarrison towns, has full force, free course, and scope in Mourzuk,\r\nbeginning as an example with His Highness the Bashaw, and descending to\r\nthe lowest soldiers. Yet they say, it was infinitely worse before the\r\npresent commanding officer had charge of the troops. The officers have\r\nno legitimate wives, nor, of course the privates. The women of Mourzuk\r\nare therefore necessarily of bold aspect and depraved manners. All the\r\nlower classes of females are usually unveiled, and will commit acts of\r\nimmodesty anywhere. In general these women are constantly being divorced\r\nand taking new husbands. In such a depraved state of society, love and\r\naffection are consequently unknown,\r\n\r\nHere never--\r\n\r\n    \"Love his gold shafts employs;\"\r\n\r\nNever here--\r\n\r\n    \"Waves his purple wings.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gagliuffi thought one of the greatest obstacles to the suppression of\r\nthe slave-trade was the facility which it afforded Moorish and Arab\r\nmerchants to indulge in sensual amours. Although a merchant would get no\r\nprofit by his long and dreary journeys over Desert, he would still carry\r\nit on for the sake of indulging in the lower passions of his nature. A\r\nslave dealer will convey a score or two of female slaves from Mourzuk to\r\nTripoli, and change the unhappy objects of his brutal lust every night.\r\nThis is, he considers, the summum bonum of human existence, and to obtain\r\nit, he will continue this nefarious trade, without the smallest gain, or\r\nprospect of gain, and die a beggar when his vile passions become extinct.\r\n\"What is life without a slave?\" says The Desert voluptuary. \"Better to\r\ndie than have no slaves!\" But there are exceptions. A young lad is placed\r\nby his uncle, who lives in Tripoli, under the care of the Consul. His\r\nuncle wrote to the Consul, \"To tell the lad, to send no more slaves to\r\nTripoli, to abandon the traffic altogether,\" adding, in his letter, \"In\r\nfuture, God deliver us from this shameful traffic!\" But the Consul\r\npreviously had written to the uncle that he would not take the boy under\r\nhis care if he trafficked in slaves. Notwithstanding all this, some few\r\nSaharan merchants there are who really detest this traffic, and its\r\nattendant immoralities. Such I have found in my later peregrinations\r\nthrough North Africa.\r\n\r\nFezzan, as vulgarly computed, is said to contain one hundred and one\r\ntowns and villages, or inhabited oases. The districts are, 1st. Mourzuk,\r\nthe capital; 2nd. East side, including Hofrah, Shargheeah, and Foghah;\r\n3rd. North side, Sebhah, Bounanees, Jofrah, and Shaty; 4th. West side,\r\nWady Sharghee, Wady Ghurby, and Wady Atbah; 5th. South side, Ghatroun.\r\nThis division embraces twelve principal towns, where there are resident\r\nKaeds. All the lesser towns have their subordinate Kaeds or Sheikhs. It\r\nwill be seen that Sockna is not included in this enumeration, and it is\r\nnot usually considered a part of the government of Fezzan. Of the rest,\r\nand all the towns, Zuela is the more interesting for its antiquities.\r\nFormerly the capital, as well as Germa, it was colonized by the Romans.\r\nZuela contains some ancient inscriptions, and not long ago two\r\nstore-rooms were discovered, full of indigo, supposed to have been a\r\nportion of the ancient commerce of the interior. Zuela is the principal\r\ntown of the division of Shargheeah, or The East.\r\n\r\nTo the natural productions of Fezzan, already enumerated, may be added,\r\nthe Trona[112], or \"Sal Natrone\" of Tripoline merchants. It is procured\r\nfrom the bottom of the lakes when the water evaporates during the summer\r\nseason. Besides its use of being masticated in Barbary, it is exported to\r\nEurope in considerable quantities, for the manufacture of glass. A little\r\ngum-arabic is procured hereabouts, and the quantity is increasing.\r\n\r\nLeo Africanus gives the following account of these oases, which, joining\r\nthose of the Tibboos, connect almost in a straight line Northern with\r\nCentral Africa:--\r\n\r\n\"Fezzen è similmente una grande abitazione, nella quale sono di grossi\r\ncastelli e di gran casali, tutti abitati da un ricco popolo si di\r\npossessioni, como di danari; perciocchè sono ne' confini di Agadez e del\r\ndiserto di Libia che confina con lo Egitto; ed è discosto dal Cairo circa\r\na sessanta giornate; nè pel diserto altra abitazione si truova, che\r\nAugela che' é nel diserto di Libia. Fezzen è dominata da un signore che è\r\ncome primario del popolo, il quale tutta la rendita del paese dispensa\r\nnel comun beneficio, pagando certo tributo a' vicini Arabi. Similmente in\r\ncotal paese è molta penuria di pane e di carne; e si mangia carne di\r\ncamello, la quale è tuttavia carissima.\"--(_Sixth Part, chap._ Liii.)\r\n\r\nFormerly Fezzan was exceedingly rich and populous, but now it is\r\nbecome impoverished to the last degree, and many of its largest\r\ndistrict populations are reduced to the starvation-point. Its\r\ninhabited oases would produce an infinitely greater amount of the\r\nmaterials of existence, if moderately cultivated, whilst many oases,\r\nonce smiling paradisal spots in Desert, are altogether abandoned.\r\nThe few merchants who have any money are those of Sockna, but which\r\ntown, as before mentioned, does not properly belong to Fezzan,\r\nthough its relations with these oases are intimate. Before the\r\nTurks and Abd-El-Geleel, Fezzan was governed by its own native\r\nSultans, whose family was of the Shereefs of Morocco. But about\r\nthirty years ago one Mukhanee, or Mukni[113], as he is commonly\r\ncalled, entered into conspiracy with the Bashaw of Tripoli to seize\r\nthe government of the native princes, who were thus deposed, and the\r\nusurped government continued in the hands of the Bashaw and his\r\ncreatures, until it was seized in turn by the brave and enterprising\r\nArab chieftain, Abd-El-Geleel. The immediate ancestors of this\r\nSheikh were destroyed by old Yousef Bashaw, amongst whom Saif\r\nNasser, grandfather of the Sheikh, and the head of the Oulad\r\nSuleiman, was a celebrated warrior. These chiefs and their tribes\r\noccupied the shores of the Syrtis (Sert ‮سرت‬), and were originally\r\nfrom Morocco. They might claim some connexion with the deposed\r\nShereefian government. When all his ancestors, and especially his\r\ngrandfather, Saif-Nasser, were butchered by the exterminating policy\r\nof Yousef Bashaw, Abd-El-Geleel, then a boy, was saved,--as an\r\ninstrument of future vengeance in the hands of Providence--by the\r\nsecret interference of the women of the Bashaw's family. As the boy,\r\nhowever, grew up, he could not fail to excite the suspicions of the\r\nBashaw, for the old hoary-headed assassin saw in him, not darkly or\r\ndimly, the sword which was being drawn by avenging Heaven to cut off\r\nhis family root and branch, perhaps his own head, and break up for\r\never his blood-cemented kingdom. These suspicions of a guilty\r\nconscience came at length to such a pitch, that the day arrived when\r\nthe innocent youth was to be strangled, so snatching violently away\r\nthe instrument of vengeance from the hands of inexorable justice!\r\nBut, on that very day, the Bashaw received intelligence of a\r\nthreatened invasion from Mehemet Ali, and old Yousef knew this\r\naspiring young warrior to be the only man who could unite the\r\nscattered and disaffected tribes of the Syrtis, and repel the\r\ninvasion. Abd-El-Geleel was therefore forthwith dispatched to muster\r\nthe Arabs, and make all things ready to meet the invading enemy.\r\nHowever, the alarms of invasion soon died away, and the young Sheikh\r\nwas sent up to the province of Fezzan to quell some insurrection of\r\nthe Arabs.\r\n\r\nBut finding himself surrounded continually with suspicious agents and\r\ncut-throat spies, who might in a moment compass his assassination, whilst\r\nthe Arabs _en route_ were ripe for revolt, the wary Sheikh at once raised\r\nthe standard of rebellion, and took possession, successively, of the town\r\nof Benioleed, the mountainous district of Gharian, the Syrtis, and the\r\nprovince of Fezzan, all which he held nine years with the style and power\r\nof a Sultan. Then the day of his fate also began to hasten on. The old\r\nBashaw's family, polluted with the most cruel and odious crimes, fell by\r\nits own intestine divisions, ending in a civil war, which war was closed\r\nby the usurpation of the Turks. Abd-El-Geleel was now called upon to\r\nsubmit to the Sultan of Constantinople, a new and a more formidable\r\nmaster. The Sheikh refused submission, and declared and carried on war\r\nwith the Turks. At length, however, his intrepid brother, Saif Nasser,\r\nwas killed in battle, and the Sultan-Sheikh became dispirited, lost his\r\ncourage and presence of mind. Abd-El-Geleel madly surrendered himself,\r\nat the instigation of his own Sheikhs, who betrayed him to the Turks, and\r\nBelazee, the present Bashaw of Fezzan, who commanded the troops against\r\nhim, on hearing of his voluntary surrender, sent word that the Arab\r\nprince was not to be brought alive into the camp. He was then instantly\r\ndecapitated! This cruel assassination took place in 1842. The whole of\r\nthe usurped districts held by the prince, now returned to the power of\r\nthe Turks.\r\n\r\nAsker Ali, the blood-thirsty tyrant then governing Tripoli, on hearing of\r\nthis intelligence was drunk with joy. His insolence to the British\r\nConsul-General knew no bounds. The tyrant even boasted openly, that God\r\nwould give into his hands his two other enemies, the British\r\nConsul-General, and the Vice-Consul of Mourzuk! The tyrant was fond of\r\ndipping in astrology and reading fate, and he was once surprised by his\r\nministers, reading the certain destruction of these last two of his\r\nremaining enemies in a small portion of sand. The consequence of all this\r\nopen violence naturally was his instant recal, Sir Stratford Canning\r\nthreatening the Porte that, if it delayed his recal more than one hour, a\r\nBritish squadron would depose the tyrant, and replace him by another\r\nBashaw. The ancient Bey of Bengazi, an exile in Malta, and one of the\r\nCaramanly family, or of the old Moorish dynasty of Bashaws, would have\r\nreplaced Asker Ali. This tyrant, like all tyrants, on receiving his\r\nrecal, was unmanned, and became weaker than a child, for the performance\r\nof acts of the darkest cruelty and the most arrant cowardice, are quite\r\ncompatible. The tyrant Asker Ali shed tears! on leaving the country,\r\nwhere he had exercised the most atrocious cruelties. However, he was\r\nfated to execute one act of justice, in the style of the Turk, against\r\nthe betrayers of Abd-El-Geleel; for the tyrant strangled all the\r\nsubordinate Arab chieftains who had conspired against their master, and\r\ndelivered him into the hands of the Turks,--the just vengeance of heaven\r\nagainst traitors. Asker Ali returned to Constantinople, and as is the\r\ncustom now-a-days, the Porte, imitating the recent policy of the French\r\nGovernment, which Government, whenever it disavows its agents, decorates\r\nthem as a matter of course,--so that to be, or get decorated, is to do\r\nsomething contrary to international law and justice,--following such a\r\ngood and honest maxim, such a discovery in the science of diplomacy, I\r\nrepeat, the Porte, in its sympathy, immediately conferred on the tyrant a\r\nnew Pashalic. Thence, after a short time, Asker Ali continuing his\r\nhorrible trade of official murder, consulting his book of fate and atoms\r\nof sand, and hanging up the good subjects of the Porte \"without judge or\r\njury,\" got again recalled; and I have not heard more of this miscreant\r\nPasha. Asker Ali is a bright jewel of native Ottoman ferocity.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Abd-El-Geleel figures in the Slave-Trade Reports of Tripoli,\r\n1843, as an abolitionist. But, according to M. Subtil, he was only\r\nbamboozling Col. Warrington[114]. This Subtil also pretends the chieftain\r\nwas more inclined to French than English interests. Such a statement is\r\nprobably a calumny of the sulphur-exploring adventurer in Tripoli, and\r\nwas made to get himself popularity in France, or to help his schemes of\r\nTripoli speculations. At any rate, it rests solely upon his very dubious\r\nauthority. The Arab prince lost all by attempting too much. He reversed\r\nthe maxim of \"attempt much, and you will get a little.\" An arrangement\r\nwas offered to the Sheikh, by which, on paying a contribution of 25,000\r\ndollars per annum, and acknowledging the sovereignty of the Grand\r\nSignior, the usurped districts should be confirmed to him, and\r\nhereditarily to his family. But, like the ten thousand military\r\nchieftains, soldiers of fortune, who have gone before him, whose faith\r\nsaw their star always in the ascendant, he sighed for Tripoli, and its\r\nBashaw's Castle, and lost all.\r\n\r\nThe son of Abd-el-Geleel, on the assassination of his father, took the\r\nadvice of Col. Warrington, and emigrated to Bornou, whose Sultan being of\r\nArab extraction, received the emigrant hospitably as a brother, and\r\nassigned the unfortunate prince and his scattered followers, a district\r\non the confines of Bornou, between the Tibboos and his own empire. Since\r\nthen, the exiled prince has received a great accession of strength by a\r\nnumerous reinforcement of the Oulad Suleiman, and is now strong enough\r\nhimself to defend his newly acquired territory, should the Sultan of\r\nBornou at any time be won over by the intrigues of the Turks, to cancel\r\nhis concession of lands and attempt to expel the refugees. This movement\r\nof the Oulad Suleiman is connected with the further military exploits of\r\nHasan Belazee.\r\n\r\nAbout a twelvemonth ago, the inhabitants of the village of Omm-Errâneb\r\n(\"mother of hares\"), took it into their heads to revolt, and upon some\r\nfrivolous pretext seized their neighbours' camels, as an intimation to\r\nthe Bashaw of their seditious intentions. It is certain, however, from\r\nwhat followed in the course of events, that their revolt was concerted\r\nwith the Oulad Suleiman. The villagers of Omm-Errâneb had not the shadow\r\nof excuse for their revolt, for they paid no contributions to the Bashaw,\r\nand merely acknowledged the Porte. This town is walled and consists of\r\nabout two hundred houses, and at the time of the war had a population of\r\nsome eight hundred souls, entirely Arab, but of the people only three\r\nhundred were armed. The Bashaw of Fezzan went out himself against the\r\nrebels, although extremely unwell, captured their city, and destroyed\r\nabout one hundred and twenty of them. The Arab townsmen fought from house\r\nto house with the most determined bravery, obstinately retiring through\r\ntheir town from one gate to the other. The Bashaw would have slaughtered\r\nmore of them, but he had no men to intercept their egress at the opposite\r\ngate of the town. His Highness lost only eight Turks and eight Arabs in\r\nthe capture of this place. On the next day, to the astonishment of all,\r\nabout six hundred of the Oulad Suleiman came up from the Syrtis, all\r\nfully armed, having left their families some two days' distance. The\r\nfirst thing they did was to capture a convoy of sick and wounded, in\r\ncharge of the Greek Doctor, all of whom they immediately butchered in\r\ncold blood, with the one exception of the Doctor.\r\n\r\nThe account which the Doctor gives of his capture and escape is\r\nsufficiently characteristic.\r\n\r\n_The Assailant._--\"May your father and mother be cursed, and your wife\r\nprostituted, you dog of a Turk!\" (raising the sword to strike him).\r\n\r\n_The Supplicant._--\"Oh! have mercy upon me, I'm a doctor,\" (falling on\r\nhis knees).\r\n\r\n_An Arab_, aside.--\"Strike! strike! he lies.\"\r\n\r\n_The Assailant._--\"May all your children beg their bread, and the curse\r\nof God be upon them!\" (seizing him by the turban to cut off his head).\r\n\r\n_The Supplicant._--\"Oh! have mercy upon me, I'm the brother of the\r\nEnglish Consul at Mourzuk, your friend.\"\r\n\r\n_The Arab_, aside.--\"Hold! hold! let him go.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Doctor did not get off until he had emptied his pockets of his\r\ndollars. In this way only he rendered his supplications effectual.\r\n\r\nIn warfare, both Turks and Greeks have been in the habit of taking what\r\nmoney they possess with them, to redeem them from slavery if captured, or\r\nfor any other available purpose in the case of defeat[115]. The Oulad\r\nSuleiman then attacked the Bashaw with extreme ferocity, and His Highness\r\nwas in great danger. He was so unwell at the time that he could not sit\r\nupon his horse. But, when the troops began to waver, the officers took\r\nthe Bashaw and set him upon his horse to show him to the soldiers. The\r\nsight of the veteran commander rallied their sinking courage. His\r\nHighness had just strength enough to hold up his sword and point to the\r\nenemy, on seeing which his troops rushed on impetuously, and obtained a\r\ncomplete victory over the Arabs. The Arabs were, however, only dispersed\r\na moment, and were allowed to reunite their scattered bands and pursue\r\ntranquilly their way to Bornou, to the prince of their tribe. All the\r\nfugitives of the Omm-Errâneb accompanied them. On their march up, they\r\nruthlessly sacked all the villages of Fezzan and the Tibboos, and\r\narrived at the quarters of their compatriots laden with booty. The\r\nBashaw returned weary and exhausted, having no sufficient force to follow\r\nup the pursuit of the Oulad Suleiman, whose march was that of conquerors\r\nrather than fugitives. Indeed, the Bashaw was glad enough of their\r\nretreat to Bornou. Whilst this fighting was going on, the greatest\r\nconfusion reigned at Mourzuk, and many of the wealthy inhabitants\r\ndeposited their money and valuables in the house of the English Consul,\r\nfor to add to their miseries, some malicious persons had reported the\r\ncapture of the Bashaw, with all his army. It is probable the Turks are\r\nexceedingly well satisfied with the emigration of these restless and\r\nindomitable Oulad Suleiman. There cannot be a doubt of their being\r\ndevoted to the English, but they are of difficult treatment for us. At\r\nthe present time, they are dispersed in marauding parties on the route of\r\nBornou, and were even an English tourist to fall into their hands, he\r\nmight be maltreated before he was recognized as a British subject, and as\r\nsuch received the protection of their prince. This was the main\r\ndifficulty which prevented my going up to Bornou.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, however, the Oulad Suleiman are getting tired of the\r\nburning climate and fevers of Bornou, and are sighing for the cool airs\r\nand healthy breezes of the shores of Syrtis, with the refreshing sight of\r\nthe dark-blue waters of the Mediterranean. For on my return to Tripoli, I\r\nfound the British Consul in negotiation with the Bashaw to procure their\r\nreturn to the Syrtis: of which since I have heard nothing. The Bashaw\r\ntold the Consul they must write to the Sultan for pardon. The negotiation\r\nwas placed in the hands of Mr. Gagliuffi, of whom they are passionately\r\nfond, and in whom they have the most implicit confidence. These\r\nmalcontent Arabs were, of course, on friendly terms with the Touaricks of\r\nGhat, as every attempt to resist the consolidation of the power of the\r\nPorte in Tripoli is viewed favourably by the Touaricks. But the marauding\r\nof the Oulad Suleiman in the interior, and the interruption of the\r\ncommerce of Bornou, ill requite the asylum and hospitality afforded them\r\nby its Sultan, and for the sake of the commerce of The Sahara, the sooner\r\nthey are back again to the Syrtis the better.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Rose early to write and prepare for my departure to Tripoli.\r\nCalled on the Turkish officers to take leave. One and all observed,\r\n\"Before you were going to h----, now you are going to heaven,\" alluding\r\nto my projected tour to Soudan. I was not of this opinion; for, after\r\nmonths and months in my dreams, night-dreams and waking-dreams, having\r\nacted over in my imagination all the dangers and privations of The\r\nDesert, and seen all the wonders of the mysterious regions of Nigritia, I\r\nset about my departure from Mourzuk with a heavy heart, lamenting my\r\nill-starred luck and failure, seeing my mission abruptly cut off midway\r\nin its accomplishment. Mr. Gagliuffi arranged for my returning to Tripoli\r\nwith the slave-caravan of Haj Essnousee, whom the reader will be pleased\r\nnot to confound with my friend Essnousee of Ghadames, who had gone on to\r\nSoudan with the return caravan. Haj Essnousee had accompanying him two or\r\nthree other traders, all of whom were natives of Sockna. Their slaves had\r\nnot come from Ghat, but had been brought three months ago by the Tibboos\r\nfrom Bornou.\r\n\r\nI left Mourzuk late in the afternoon. I had heard the melancholy song of\r\nthe slaves departing in the morning. I had now to overtake them this\r\nevening. Mr. Gagliuffi and the Doctor accompanied me outside the gates,\r\nand the Consul's Moorish servant conducted me to the first night's\r\nencampment, both of us riding horses. I do not regret turning off the\r\ndirect route to Tripoli, and visiting Mourzuk before my return. For here\r\nI obtained a better idea of the Upper Provinces of Tripoli, and I am\r\ngreatly indebted to the Vice-Consul for his assistance in my researches.\r\nI must acknowledge likewise the kind attentions of the Doctor and the\r\nTurkish officers. I bade Mr. Gagliuffi an affectionate farewell, who\r\nanswered with the plain earnest old English of \"God bless you!\" I left\r\nthe Consul in but indifferent health. Three times has he had the fever,\r\nyet he is determined to keep up to the last. When Mr. Gagliuffi first\r\nwent to Mourzuk, he expected that Abd-El-Geleel, whose agent he was, as\r\nwell as having the appointment of British Vice-Consul, would have been\r\nconfirmed in his authority. But this Chief's assassination left the\r\nConsul to struggle against formidable difficulties, and Mr. Gagliuffi was\r\nobliged to apply to the British Government for pecuniary assistance,\r\nwhich has been tardily granted.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Mr. Gagliuffi has fully answered all the objects\r\noriginally projected. The traffic in slaves is well watched on this\r\nroute, and reported upon. The Vice-Consul exercises a beneficial\r\ninfluence on the affairs of Mourzuk, and is useful both to the governing\r\npower and the governed. The population of Fezzan have great faith in the\r\nintegrity of Mr. Gagliuffi as agent of the British Government. The Consul\r\nassists them in various ways. Some twenty months ago he lent the people\r\nof Mourzuk money to meet the tribute demanded from them by the Government\r\nof Tripoli. His relations with Bornou have already been mentioned. The\r\nVizier of the Sheikh lately, on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca,\r\nstopped at the Consul's house, and Mr. Gagliuffi transacted all his\r\nbusiness. Most strangers go to the Consul, in preference to the Ottoman\r\nauthorities, or the people of the town. A great Maroquine Marabout came\r\nthis way from Mecca, and deposited all his money, whilst in Mourzuk, in\r\nthe hands of the Consul. The people were jealous that a Marabout should\r\ntrust a Christian in preference to themselves, and remonstrated with the\r\nMarabout, who very drily replied to them, \"You are not of the Faithful:\r\nyou are all robbers. I am obliged to trust this Christian.\"\r\n\r\nUnquestionably the establishment of English Consuls and Vice-Consuls\r\nthroughout The Desert, and all the great cities of the Interior of\r\nAfrica, would be an immense benefit to humanity, whilst it would equally\r\npromote British trade and interests, and the commerce of the entire\r\nworld. One day, in happier times, there may be a Minister wise enough and\r\nbold enough to undertake this great enterprize, and to make this\r\napplication of our resources, which eventually would be no sacrifice, for\r\nthe benefit of all mankind. It will, however, require sacrifices from\r\nindividuals as well as from Government, for a residence in The Desert or\r\nCentral Africa is no consular retreat, or diplomatic lounge for an\r\ninvalid Minister. But if any sacrifice be made for foreign nations and\r\ncountries, it surely should be made for Africa, on whose unhappy children\r\nwe as a nation, in past times, have inflicted such enormous wrongs.\r\n\r\nI shall only give one instance of the positive and material benefit which\r\nthe people of Fezzan have derived from the establishment of the British\r\nConsul at Mourzuk. Mr. Gagliuffi induced the people to cultivate the\r\ntholh for collecting gums. Fifty cantars were collected the first year,\r\nand last year some two hundred. The whole of the population are now\r\nseized with a fit of gum-collecting, but they are not yet expert at\r\nmaking the incisions in the trees. In the course of time it will be a\r\nmost profitable article of export for the people. This gum now sells for\r\n10 or 12 mahboubs the cantar in Tripoli. Such has been entirely the \"good\r\nwork\" of the English Consul.\r\n\r\nWe stopped at one of Mr. Gagliuffi's gardens to get some sweet water.\r\nThis was a very nice plantation of palms overshadowing crops of corn. The\r\nConsul has several of these gardens, but all of a limited size. After\r\nsunset, we found the encampment at Terzah. It consisted of three\r\nmerchants and their servants, about sixty slaves, most of whom were young\r\nwomen and girls, and twelve camels. Felt cold during the night--in fact\r\ncaught cold, and not very well. Ought to have a tent. Said very happy in\r\nthe prospect of returning to Tripoli, and as usual immediately made\r\nfriends amongst the male and female slaves.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[111] Our former tourists say: \"The opinion of everybody, Arabs,\r\n    Tripolines, and our predecessors (Mr. Ritchie and Captain Lyon),\r\n    were unanimous as to the insalubrity of its air.\" And \"Every one\r\n    of us, some in a greater or less degree, had been seriously\r\n    disordered; and amongst the inhabitants themselves, anything like\r\n    a healthy-looking person was a rarity.\" Denham observes also that\r\n    to account for the sickliness of Mourzuk was a very difficult\r\n    matter, and required a wiser head than his.\r\n\r\n[112] _Trona_, ‮الطرون‬, and ‮ترونه‬ \"Carbonate of\r\n    Soda.\" The great _Trona_ lake is near Germa or Garama.\r\n\r\n[113] ‮مُخني‬\r\n\r\n[114] See \"Histoire d'Abd-el-Geleel, Sultan de Fezzan, assassiné\r\n    en 1842.\" _Revue de L'Orient_, Sept., 1844.\r\n\r\n[115] The Doctor afterwards recovered his money, the Arab who\r\n    captured him having fallen in the skirmish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nFROM MOURZUK TO SOCKNA.\r\n\r\n     Well of Esh-Shour.--Village of Dillaim.--Tying up a Female Slave\r\n     to the Camel.--Village of Gudwah.--Well of Bel-Kashee\r\n     Faree.--Melancholy Songs of the Slaves.--Reflections on the Slave\r\n     Trade; Christian Republicans, and the Scottish Free Kirk.--Well\r\n     of Mukni.--El-Bab.--She-Camels with Foals.--How American Consuls\r\n     justify Slavery.--Arrival at Sebhah, and description of the\r\n     People.--Cruelty of a Moorish Boy to the young Female\r\n     Slaves.--Prohibited Food in matters of Religion.--The Taste of a\r\n     Locust.--Anecdotes related by the Bashaw of Mourzuk and Mr.\r\n     Gagliuffi.--Divinations of the Tyrant Asker Ali.--Continual\r\n     delays.--Altercation with a Moor about Religion.--The Songs of\r\n     the Female Slaves interpreted.--Version of Mr. Whittier, the\r\n     American Poet.--The _Amor Patriæ_ of the Negroes.--Primitive\r\n     Style of playing Draughts.--Games and Wine prohibited by the\r\n     Koran.--Sebhah, a City of the Dead.--Oases and extent of the\r\n     Sebhah district.--Fezzanee Palms bear Fruit without Water.--Town\r\n     of Timhanah.--Bad Odour of the Turks in these Oases.--Essnousee,\r\n     an atrocious Slave Driver.--Stroke of a Scorpion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_6th._--ROSE early, and made a long day. Passed a few dwarf wild palms.\r\nCountry about here is mostly sandy, and in hollow flats. Encamped by the\r\nwell of Esh-Shour. Our course east and north-east. We passed by the small\r\nvillage of Dillaim. One of the Moors travelling with us said to me, \"Oh,\r\nmaster, how could you think of going to Soudan! How you would have\r\nsuffered!\" I returned, \"No noble enterprizes are achieved without great\r\nmental and bodily suffering.\" This remark impressed him in my favour, and\r\nwe continued great friends all the route to Tripoli.\r\n\r\nThis morning Haj Essnousee, being on foot, called out for his camel to\r\nstop, in a tone which denoted he had some important business on hand. I\r\nturned to see what was the matter, and so did all, as if something\r\npeculiar was about to happen. I then saw Essnousee bringing up a slave\r\ngirl about a dozen years of age, pulling her violently along. When he got\r\nher up to the camel, he took a small cord and began tying it round her\r\nneck. Afterwards, bethinking himself of something, he tied the cord round\r\nthe wrist of her right arm. This done, Essnousee drove the camel on. In a\r\nfew minutes she fell down, and the slave-master, seeing her fallen down,\r\nand a man attempting to raise her up, cried out, \"Let her alone, cursed\r\nbe your father! you dog.\" The wretched girl was then dragged on the\r\nground over the sharp stones, being fastened by her wrist, but she never\r\ncried or uttered a word of complaint. Her legs now becoming lacerated and\r\nbleeding profusely, she was lifted up by Essnousee's Arabs. She then,\r\nhowever, continued to hold on, the rope being also bound round her body\r\nso as to help her along. Thus she was dragged, limping and tumbling down,\r\nand crippled all the day, which was a very long day's journey. Whether\r\nshe feigned sickness, or sulked, or was exhausted, I leave the reader to\r\njudge. Neither I nor her cruel master could tell. Indeed, such is the\r\nnature of the Negro character it is impossible to tell. A slave may sulk,\r\nand may not; whilst also ill and dying, they may be flogged on the point\r\nof death, as Haj Ibrahim flagellated his dying victim. No doubt, at times\r\nthese wretched slaves, when worn down and exhausted, play some innocent\r\ntricks to get a ride. Nevertheless, such is the power of sullen\r\ninsensibility which slaves can command, that the brutal masters may flog\r\nthem to death without finding out whether they are really ill, or only\r\nsulky.\r\n\r\n_7th._--On our return from a difficult journey, everything is, or appears\r\nto be easy. We think little or nothing of it, especially if we have got\r\nwith us a new supply of matters of equipment and provisions. So I rose\r\nearly with the most profound indifference of the month's journey before\r\nme, as if travelling in old England, and I must likewise add, with less\r\nanxiety for the safety of my baggage. Desert baggage-stealers there are\r\nindeed none, and pickpockets and pilferers are as rare as the birds,\r\nwhich now and then are seen hopping about the wells, picking up what they\r\ncan chance to find.\r\n\r\nOur course is north, over an undulating sandy soil. About 11 A.M. we had\r\nin view Ghudwah, and in an hour more we reached the village. Ghudwah is a\r\ncluster of wretched mud hovels, rendered tolerable by being placed amidst\r\na wood of palms. The squalor of these humble dwellings is, in truth,\r\nforgotten amongst the patches of beautiful green corn, some already in\r\nthe ear, and the graceful, towering, all-over-hanging palm-trees. In a\r\nwady on the left were also forests of palms. The oases of Fezzan are, in\r\nfact, but a series of these palm forests. Unquestionably a great body of\r\nwater must be under and near the surface. But we must keep to the\r\ndesignation of oases in describing the province of Fezzan, of which we\r\nhad a convincing proof this morning; for, during four or five hours we\r\ntraversed a country in every respect desert, covered with small black\r\nstones, defying all attempts at cultivation, and this desert land\r\napparently surrounds and intersects the entire series of the oases of\r\nFezzan.\r\n\r\nWhen we got clear of Ghudwah we halted for the day, about 2 P.M., near a\r\nwell called Bel-Kashee-Faree. I was glad to halt, both for the sake of\r\nthe slaves, and myself. To-day the same girl was not tied to the camel,\r\nbut a younger one. She also, poor thing, was dragged along, limping as\r\nshe went, and whenever she stopped a moment to tie up her sandals, she\r\nhad the greatest difficulty to reach again the camel. I was annoyed to\r\nsee none of her sister-slaves give her a lift and help her on to get up\r\nto the camel, so that she might continue to be assisted by its march.\r\nSome of the poor things, however, have their intimate friends in their\r\nfellow bondswomen. The girl dragged on yesterday, had her faithful\r\ncompanion, bringing her water and dates. But in spite of all their\r\nsufferings, the poor bondswomen keep up well. The young women sing and\r\nsometimes dance on the road, while the boys ape the Turkish soldiers whom\r\nthey had seen exercise in Mourzuk, walking in file, holding up sticks on\r\ntheir shoulders, and crying out \"Shoulder arms!\" or words to that effect.\r\nThe guileless lads of Africa think these two magic words to be the\r\nquintessence of Turkish and European civilization, and that which renders\r\nthe white men superior to their sable fathers. Two of the boys are\r\ndressed in old soldiers' jackets and look very droll. So we journey along\r\nas well as we can.\r\n\r\nBut whilst surveying the march of this troop of human cattle for the\r\nmarket, I can't but think how dreadful a trade is this of buying and\r\nselling our fellow creatures! The Moors and Arabs of the ghafalah are\r\ncivil enough. They discover great curiosity at seeing me write, and not a\r\nlittle surprise, like all I have met with, to find me writing Arabic,\r\nwhilst some of themselves cannot. They are all of Sockna.\r\n\r\nIt is now near sunset, but I am not going to write a description of a\r\nSaharan sunset, which this evening offers nothing but sheets of bright\r\nyellow flame. Towards the east, the palms, underwood, and herbage make me\r\nfancy myself in the midst of a boundless circle of cultivation, for I see\r\nno \"darksome desert\" through the pale skyey openings of the thick\r\nverdure. My feelings thus would be soothed and gratified, were it not\r\nthat the sounds--always to me so melancholy--of the Negroes' song, as\r\nthey clap their hands and sing and dance their native sports, are heard\r\nnear my encampment. Then again I feel happy in the reflection that God\r\ngives moments of joyous happiness even to slaves. Why not be soothed to\r\nhear this song of slaves? What a mysterious thing is Providence! Not to\r\nthe masters of these slaves, who are now stretched in dreamy listlessness\r\non the ground, gives God such jocund innocent delights; not to the wiser\r\nand wisest, to the stronger or strongest, (as \"the battle is not to the\r\nstrong,\") gives God happiness; but to the poorest, weakest of mortals,\r\nthe forlorn, helpless female slave! As I have mentioned, I heard this\r\nsame song--to me so melancholy and disheartening--as the slaves were\r\ndeparting from Mourzuk. I was then quietly writing, but as the mournful\r\naccents broke on my ear, I started from my usual propriety of feeling,\r\nand the courage which carried me over The Desert gave away under the\r\npressure of these strange Nigritian sounds of the poor black children,\r\nthe desolate daughters of the banks of the mysterious Niger. The tears\r\nrushed to my eyes, but I stopped them in their lachrymal sluices, and\r\ncalled it folly, for to weep I cannot, I will not. Rather let me curse\r\nthe slave-dealers of every land and clime. Yes, let this foolish\r\nsensibility be turned to exasperation; let me curse those proud\r\nRepublicans, in whose heart there is no flesh, whose flag bears impiously\r\nagainst Heaven the stripes and the scars of the slaves! These I cursed,\r\nand those who in the hypocrisy of their souls, and their sanctimonious\r\npretensions to Church freedom, received the gold tainted with the blood\r\nof the slave, to build up their Free Kirk! But why curse? What impotence!\r\nWhy not leave the avenging bolt of wrath to that God, who \"hath made of\r\none blood all the nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the\r\nearth?\"\r\n\r\n_8th._--Rose at sunrise and started with the day. Route north and\r\nnorth-west, over an undulating gravelly plain. A few tholh trees, and one\r\nsolitary tholh by the road-side, which at a great distance forms a very\r\nconspicuous object. A single tree in The Desert always excites more\r\ninterest in the mind of the reflective traveller than a forest. Solitary\r\npalms are often seen near the coast. At noon, reached the well called\r\nBeer Mukhanee, after the distinguished traitor, who dug it, but who\r\nbetrayed and ruined this country. Many a tyrant and traitor has left\r\nbehind him some monument of utility, to relieve the weight of his\r\ninfamous name with posterity. The well is very deep and the water good,\r\nbut we did not take in any, as wells are frequent hereabouts. Continued\r\nour course until sunset, a long day, and encamped at the base of a small\r\nmountain, called Babān, or \"Two Doors,\" and by others, El-Bab, or \"The\r\nDoor.\" The Door and the Gate, like the famous \"Iron Gate\" in Algeria, are\r\nfrequent names of rocky hills and mountains in this part of Africa.\r\nGhaljeewan, a mountainous district of the south-eastern part of Aheer, is\r\ncalled \"the door of Aheer.\" On the Danube there is a reef of ugly and\r\nhuge rocks, over which the current of the river dashes furiously. The\r\nTurks call this \"The Iron Gate\" of the Danube.\r\n\r\nOn the road the camels had no herbage to eat. Some of them ate the dried\r\ndung of camels and horses. We have a young camel with us about four\r\nmonths old; it continues to suck. It has no frolic or fun in its actions,\r\nand is as serious as its mother. The foal of the camel frolics in awkward\r\nantics a few days after its birth, but apparently soon loses all its\r\ninfant mirth. In the first place, the foal has to walk as long a day as\r\nits mother, enough to take all the fun out of the poor little thing;\r\nthen, it sees all its more aged companions very serious and melancholy,\r\nand soon imbibes their sombre spirit, assuming their slow solemn gait.\r\nThe mother-camel never licks or shows any particular fondness for its\r\nyoung beyond opening her legs for the foal to suck. At best, the camel,\r\nas an animal, is a most ungainly and unlovely creature. What surprises me\r\nmost are the bites of the male-camel. He bites his neighbour, without\r\npassion or any apparent provocation, and simply because he has nothing\r\nelse to do _en route_, or nothing arrests his attention.\r\n\r\nTo write in the open Desert is no sinecure. When I go under the shade\r\nfrom the sun the wind blows unpityingly, when in the sun the flies\r\ntorment me. Our grand slave-driver Haj Essnousee, is most determinedly\r\nbent on showing himself a perfect master in his profession. This\r\nafternoon he set to work beating one poor girl most shockingly for not\r\nkeeping up with the rest. Nearly all got whipped along to-day. Gave a\r\nride to one little fellow, hardly five years of age, who limped sadly.\r\nThere was no sulk in him. He was cheerful with all his sufferings. Our\r\nroad is strewn with chumps of petrified wood.\r\n\r\nWas thinking to-day, for whilst travelling with slaves the subject is\r\nmost disagreeably pressed upon you, even to nausea, of the reasons\r\noffered by American Consuls in vindication of slavery in the United\r\nStates. Mr. P----thus apologized:--\"I once spoke to a male slave who\r\nearned plenty of money. I said, 'Do you want to be freed?' 'Oh no,' he\r\nreplied, 'I get fifty dollars a month. I give my master forty and keep\r\nten for myself. Why should I wish to be free?'\" Mr. M---- said to me one\r\nday, \"My wife has slaves, but they are well taken care of. They each have\r\ntwo new suits of clothes per year, and the doctor's bill for each comes\r\nto two or three dollars also per year.\" To such miserable drivelling as\r\nthis are men, of some education and standing in society, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the free as well as the slave States, driven to\r\nbolster up the nefarious system of holding in bondage their fellow\r\ncreatures! In the one case, a man robs his brother of the rightful fruits\r\nof his labour. This robbery is perpetrated coolly and deliberately\r\nthrough a series of years. In the other case, the taking care of a slave,\r\nas every humane man must take care of his horse, and give him good beans,\r\nhay, and a warm stable, is made the corner stone of \"the living lie\" of\r\nliberty on the southern transatlantic plains.\r\n\r\n_9th._--Rose with the sun, throwing his orient beams of gold athwart all\r\nthe plain, and purpling the rocky block of El-Bab. I mounted the rock,\r\nand saw Sebhah in the north, where we were to rest in the afternoon.\r\nThere was a huge stone balancing on a ledge of the rock, which apparently\r\nwanted but a feather's weight to throw it down. Bent on mischief, I was\r\ngoing to heave it down, when the people called to me to desist. On\r\ndescending, they told me the stone had fallen from the clouds and caught\r\nthere; it was unlucky to touch it. A demon sits upon it every night and\r\nswings himself as a child is swung in a swing. Continued our route over a\r\nsandy plain, until we arrived at a line of palms stretching east and\r\nwest, as far as the eye could see. At 11 A.M., we entered the suburbs of\r\nthe town. After a little rest I went to see what sort of a place it was.\r\nFound it a tolerably well-built place; the houses are constructed of\r\nstone and mud-mortar; some have even got a touch of lime or pipe-clay\r\nwash. Several of the streets are covered in at the top like those of\r\nGhadames. Very few people stirring about, being occupied in the suburban\r\ngardens. Fell in with a cobbler, a tailor, and an old pedagogue with an\r\nABC board. Discussed the politics of the place with them all. They took\r\nme at first for a Turkish Rais coming from Mourzuk. When they found I was\r\nnot a Turk, they began to abuse the Turks. \"The Turks,\" said they, \"take\r\nall our money and leave us nothing to eat but dates. The curse of God be\r\nupon them!\" Whenever Turkish officers stop here they levy contributions.\r\nThe town is walled in with mud and stone-work, and there are several\r\ntowers around it forming part of the wall, pierced with loopholes for\r\nfiring musketry therefrom. Most of these towns are built for protecting\r\nthe people against the Arabs, who can do nothing against a wall, even\r\nwere it only a brick thick. One small piece of cannon would be enough to\r\nbatter down every one of these Saharan-fortified towns. A part of this\r\ntown is placed on a small hill, like Ghat. Sebhah has a dull dingy\r\nappearance at a distance. There is no lime-wash to give it that agreeable\r\naspect which many Moorish towns have, although always very delusive when\r\none enters their gates.\r\n\r\nThis forenoon, a slave-girl was sadly goaded along. An Arab boy of about\r\nthe same age was her goad, who was whipping her and goading her along\r\nwith a sharp piece of wood. Sometimes the young rascal would poke up her\r\nperson. I could not see this without interfering, although I am afraid to\r\ninterfere. She had got far behind, and the boy was thus tormenting her\r\nlike a young imp. I made him take one hand, and I the other. But we could\r\nnot get her up to the camel on which she might lay hold by means of a\r\nrope, and so get dragged along. We then set her upon a donkey, but she\r\nwas too unwell to ride, and fell off several times, the cruel rogue of a\r\nboy beating her every time she fell. What annoyed me more, her companions\r\nin bondage, those hearty and well, set up a loud yell of laughter every\r\ntime she fell off. I'm sick at heart of writing these shocking details.\r\nBut the reader will not be surprised that the Moors make bad\r\nslave-masters, when they have such an early training as this little\r\nreprobate boy, the nephew of Haj Essnousee. I often wondered how this\r\nboy, who was some thirteen years of age, and fully capable of the\r\nsentiment of love, in a climate like Africa, could torment these poor\r\ngirls of his own age with such brutality. If he found one lagging behind,\r\nand at some distance from the grown-up men, he would strip her, throw her\r\ndown, and begin tormenting her in the way I have already mentioned. I\r\nspoke to his uncle about it, but without avail. I then refused to carry\r\non my camel some choice dates, which he had in his charge for Tripoli.\r\nBut it was of no use, the boy was the worthy pupil of his uncle, a little\r\nfiend of ferocity.\r\n\r\nMy Sockna companions of travel chat with me, but their conversation\r\noffers nothing new or remarkable. \"There is no money in Fezzan. Our\r\ncity (Sockna) only has a few merchants. Mukhanee was originally a\r\nmerchant, and a member of the Divan of Mourzuk. He ruined Fezzan.\"\r\nOne of the people of this place said to me, \"Better if you were a\r\nMussulman, and ate and drank like us.\" I replied, \"I eat everything\r\ngood, and never fast to make myself ill.\" This plain speech amazed\r\nthem. But one said, somewhat to my surprise, \"That only which is not\r\ngood, and not fit to eat, is haram (prohibited).\" I immediately said\r\n\"Amen\" to this, for generally the Moors maintain that pork and other\r\nthings of the kind prohibited, are not good because they are\r\nprohibited, and not on account of any intrinsic badness in the\r\nthings themselves. They, of course, asked me what sort of places\r\nwere England and London. It's little use to answer such questions;\r\nthey cannot realize the idea or forms of an European city, even in\r\nimagination. Describing the riches of London, one observed\r\nill-naturedly, \"Oh, God gives the infidels peace in this world, and\r\nfire in the next.\" I then thought it time to leave off my\r\ndescription. Whilst we were chatting, a locust was caught and\r\nroasted. I tasted it, and found it not a bad shrimp. The locust\r\nrequires salt and oil to make it palatable. The Arabs swear the locusts\r\nhave a king, which perfectly agrees with--Καὶ ἔχουσιν ἐ\r\nφ' αὐτῶν βασιλέα: (Rev. ix. 11.) The name given to this\r\ninsect monarch as perfectly corresponds with their migratory devastations,\r\nΑπολλυων, \"destroyer,\" for before their march are smiling fields of\r\nverdure and fruitfulness, whilst behind them are desert and\r\ndevastation.\r\n\r\nI find in this part of my journal several anecdotes of the Bashaw of\r\nMourzuk and Mr. Gagliuffi, which seem to have come to my recollection _en\r\nroute_. The Tibboo chief before mentioned, whose jurisdiction extends\r\nover a wretched village, observed one day to the Bashaw, \"The Sultan of\r\nthe Tibboos (himself) inquires after the health of the Sultan of the\r\nTurks. But I am well, therefore the Sultan of the Turks is well; and if I\r\nam not well, then the Sultan of the Turks is not well.\" His Excellency\r\nreplied, menacingly, \"You're right, but take care you don't get unwell,\r\nfor by G--d if you do get unwell, and so make my Sultan unwell, I'll come\r\nand cut all your people's throats, and burn down your city.\" The Tibboo\r\nchief, feeling the force of the argumentum ad hominem, started out of the\r\naudience-chamber in a fright, and made off from Mourzuk as quick as\r\npossible. Before, indeed, he could get off, he began to fancy himself\r\nill, and was ill with fright, and expected every moment to be within the\r\nclutches of the Bashaw. I related to the Bashaw the story of the Governor\r\nof Ghat, having the sword of his ancestors amongst the trophies at\r\nConstantinople. The facetious Bashaw observed to me:--\"You ought to have\r\nsaid, 'I'll fetch you the sword, Haj Ahmed, if you'll promise like a good\r\nlittle boy not to cut your fingers with it.'\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gagliuffi was well acquainted with the tyrant Asker Ali. The tyrant\r\nonce dreamt he should kill Abd-El-Geleel, and his brother, and some other\r\nchiefs, but one would escape. The escaping Sheikh was Ghoma, now an exile\r\nat Trebisonde. This dream was actually related and retailed in Tripoli\r\ntwo years before the events happened. One day Mr. Gagliuffi called on the\r\ntyrant, and found him very thoughtful divining in the rumel (\"sand\").\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked the Consul. His Highness exclaimed, \"Oh, I'm\r\nmuch troubled. An Arab chief has come here professing allegiance to my\r\ngovernment. But he's a great villain, for such I have found him in the\r\nsand.\" The next day the unfortunate Arab was assassinated. Many an honest\r\nman was murdered by the fortuitous throw and fall, and scattering of\r\nthese atom sands, in the cruel fingers of the tyrant. Who will deny after\r\nthis that the events of our life are (to us) so many accidents? A\r\nTouarghee Sheikh once proposed to Mr. Gagliuffi to sell his country to\r\nthe Sultan of the English. The Consul, who took this as serious, ought to\r\nhave considered it a joke of the grave Touarghee. The Touaricks can tell\r\nthe most funny stories, and make the most cutting gibes at their\r\nneighbours, without moving a single muscle of the face.\r\n\r\n_10th._--We are to stay here to-day and to-morrow, in order that our\r\nslave-masters may obtain provisions. These people can do nothing without\r\nlosing an enormous quantity of time. It breaks my heart to lose so much\r\nprecious time. I could have got up to Soudan before I shall get down to\r\nTripoli. A Touarghee once talked to me of travelling, and on my telling\r\nhim I was going to The East, to the New World (America), and many other\r\nplaces, he exclaimed, \"Allah Akbar, thou fool, thy life isn't long\r\nenough.\" And certainly it would not were we to travel at the rate of our\r\nSaharans. They never measure a man's life and what he can do in it. The\r\nday present, and its evils, is with them enough. The proverb quoted by\r\nthe great teacher of Christianity, \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil\r\nthereof,\" is much better adapted to ancient than modern society, or\r\nrather to Oriental and African than European society. The European is\r\nobliged to think of the morrow, and take thought for the morrow, or he\r\nwould not be able to live; in these days of restless and overpowering\r\ncompetition he would die of starvation. One of the Moors tried to write\r\nthe name of Mahomet in Roman letters. I have seen several Moors attempt\r\nthis; one did it pretty well.\r\n\r\nAt noon, had a strong altercation with a Moor of the town about religion,\r\nwho introduced the subject and was very insulting. Being out of the hands\r\nof the Touaricks I have less delicacy on these matters, and so I boldly\r\ncontradicted his notions. I told him, with all frankness, \"It was\r\nimpossible for a good Christian ever to become a Mussulman: a bad\r\nChristian might, one who had robbed, or murdered, or run away from his\r\ncountry. Such were the Spaniards who run away from the prisons of exile\r\nin Morocco. Mahomet witnessed that Jesus was a true prophet; and Jesus\r\nwitnessed that Moses was a prophet, and Moses prophesied of Jesus. But\r\nneither Jesus, nor Moses, nor any other prophet, witnessed to the truth\r\nof the mission of Mahomet.\" This amazed him excessively. Seeing this, I\r\nadded, \"Never attempt to convert a Christian, or speak to him about\r\nreligion; for in the end you are sure to be dissatisfied.\" The zealot\r\nimmediately changed the conversation. Several of the people of the town\r\nlistened to our argument, but they made no observation, except one old\r\nman, who observed laconically, \"Mahometans, Jews, and Christians, are all\r\nrogues; but God is merciful.\" This, I think, is about the truth.\r\n\r\nThis evening the female slaves were unusually merry and excited in\r\nsinging, and I had the curiosity to ask Said what they were singing\r\nabout. As several spoke the language of his own country, Mandara and\r\nBornou, he had no difficulty in answering the question. I had often asked\r\nthe Moors about the merry songs and plaintive dirges of the negresses,\r\nbut could never get a satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nSaid replied at first, \"Oh, they're singing of Rubbee (God).\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" I rejoined impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't you know,\" he continued; \"they ask God to give them the\r\nAtkah[116].\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n_Said._--\"No; they say, 'Where are we going to? The world is large, O\r\nGod! Where are we going? O God! Shall we return again to our country?'\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Is that all, what else?\"\r\n\r\n_Said._--\"They call to their remembrance their own country and say,\r\n'Bornou was a pleasant country, full of all good things, but this is a\r\nbad country and we are miserable, and are ready to sink down.'\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"Do they say anything more?\"\r\n\r\n_Said._--\"No, they repeat these words over and over again, and add, 'O\r\nGod! give us our âtkah, let us go to our dear home.'\"\r\n\r\nI am not surprised the Moors never gave me a satisfactory answer\r\nrespecting the songs said and sung by their slaves. Who can assert that\r\nthe above words are not an appropriate song? What could have been more\r\ncongenially adapted to their present woeful condition? And what language\r\ncould have given us a more favourable opinion of the feeling and\r\nintellect of the African? May pitying Heaven hear the prayers of these\r\npoor creatures, give them their liberty, restore them to their country!\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, these poor bondswomen should cheer up their\r\nhearts with words and sentiments like these; but, oftentimes, their\r\nsufferings were too great for them to strike up this melancholy dirge,\r\nand the silence of the dreadful Desert was many days unsubdued,\r\nuninterrupted by these mournful strains!\r\n\r\nI take this opportunity of noticing the several love ditties and songs\r\nabout gallant chiefs and warriors returning from battle, the lovers of\r\nthe sable maidens, attributed to these poor female slaves _en route_ over\r\nThe Desert, as found in some books of travel, which, I believe, are the\r\ninvention of slave-masters, embellished by the traveller. No; their song\r\nis, and was, and always will be, because the spontaneous voice of\r\ndistressed nature, appealing to the justice and help of the Author of\r\nall being!\r\n\r\n\"O God! give us our freedom. Where are we going? The world is large and\r\nterrifies us.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we return again to our dear homes, where we lived happily and\r\nenjoyed every blessing?\r\n\r\n\"But we are in a horrible country; all things frown upon us; we suffer,\r\nand are ready to die.\r\n\r\n\"O God! give us our freedom[117].\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. G. Whittier, the distinguished American poet, has rendered these\r\nwords into verse. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"The following is an attempt to versify this melancholy appeal of\r\ndistressed human nature to the help and justice of God. Nothing can be\r\nadded to its simple pathos.\r\n\r\nSONG OF THE SLAVES IN THE DESERT.\r\n\r\n    Where are we going? Where are we going?\r\n      Where are we going, Rubee?\r\n    Hear us! Save us! Make us free;\r\n    Send our Atka down from thee!\r\n    Here the Ghiblee wind is blowing,\r\n    Strange and large the world is growing!\r\n    Tell us, Rubee, where are we going?\r\n      Where are we going, Rubee?\r\n\r\n    Bornou! Bornou! Where is Bornou?\r\n      Where are we going, Rubee?\r\n    Bornou-land was rich and good,\r\n    Wells of water, fields of food;\r\n    Bornou-land we see no longer,\r\n    Here we thirst, and here we hunger,\r\n    Here the Moor man smites in anger;\r\n      Where are we going, Rubee?\r\n\r\n    Where are we going? Where are we going?\r\n      Hear us, save us, Rubee!\r\n    Moons of marches from our eyes,\r\n    Bornou-land behind us lies;\r\n    Hot the desert wind is blowing,\r\n    Wild the waves of sand are flowing!\r\n    Hear us! tell us, Where are we going?\r\n      Where are we going, Rubee?\"\r\n\r\nSome freed slaves passed to-day on their return to Bornou, their native\r\nland. This reminded me of what Mr. Gagliuffi related respecting a female\r\nslave, who, after being brought to Mourzuk, was taken back by her master\r\nto Bornou. When her master first told her of his intention, she simply\r\nreplied, \"No, you will not take me back.\" She always persisted in the\r\nsame reply, when the subject was ever mentioned. At length the time came,\r\nand she was mounted on a camel and started off. But her master, on\r\nreturning, having changed the first part of the route from that which he\r\ncame, her suspicions and unbelief were at once confirmed. However, a few\r\ndays elapsed and the old route was resumed, and seeing, at last, from\r\nvarious indications of the road that she was really returning, she burst\r\ninto convulsions of joy, and with no ordinary care her life was saved.\r\nShe never properly recovered from the effect of these convulsions of\r\ntransport. What can be stronger than such feelings of _amor patriæ_, what\r\nmore marked proof of intelligent sensibility, allying the negro with the\r\nwhole human, race? For,\r\n\r\n    \"Lives there a man with soul so dead,\r\n    Who never to himself hath said,\r\n    'This is my own, my native land.'\"\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Pritchard's argument be good in religion, by the existence of\r\nwhich sentiment in the breast of every portion of humankind he proves\r\nthat all men are of one species, and of one original race or stock, the\r\nargument is equally true of patriotism. I have found, however, some\r\nMoors, like some of our philosophers, denying the Negro to be of the same\r\nrace as the white man. But such Mahometan detractors of the Negro\r\ncharacter are extremely rare. The greatest champion of this class was a\r\nslave-dealer, and, indeed, it is a convenient opinion for men-stealers of\r\nevery nation.\r\n\r\nThe Moors have a primitive way of making a draught-board. A person of the\r\ntown brought an apron full of sand. This he threw upon a stone bench, and\r\nspread it over, making a number of holes for the white and black squares\r\nof the board. This done, they then brought a certain number of pieces of\r\nstones with a corresponding number of dried balls of camel's dung, (and\r\nwhich, it may be remarked, are very small in comparison to the size of\r\nthe animal). The whole was now complete and the parties set to work. All\r\nthe Islamites whom I have seen are passionately fond of gaming and games\r\nof chance; and, curious enough, thousands who could not be prevailed upon\r\nto drink wine (or eat pork), will game all day long, notwithstanding that\r\ngaming is prohibited in the very sentences of the Koran, in which wine is\r\ncondemned. \"They will ask thee (Mahomet) concerning wine and lots.\r\n_Answer._--In both there is great sin.\" \"Satan seeketh to sow dissension\r\nand hatred amongst you, by means of wine and lots,\" &c. (Surat ii. and\r\nv.) How the commentators have quieted the consciences of the Faithful on\r\nthe point of lots and not about wine, I cannot imagine. Such is the\r\nabsolute folly of matters of this sort, the \"clean\" and the \"unclean\" in\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n_11th._--The sky is overcast this morning, and, what a wonder! we have\r\nhad a few precious drops of rain. Rain, like gold, is valuable according\r\nto circumstances. Wind from N.W. No heat is now felt here. Sebhah is the\r\nvery abode of dead men, the catacombs of the living. Here, at mid-day,\r\nyou might sit in the lonely streets, and lecture on the immortality of\r\nthe soul, to the few people, who, at long intervals, pass flitting by,\r\nlike spectres of the dead. The melancholy appearance of the place so\r\nhorrifies me that I don't go into it. When and where the inhabitants\r\nrendezvous and gossip is a complete mystery. To the palms and huts of\r\npalm-leaves without the town, I return, to convince myself I am in the\r\nland of the living. Visited some of the suburban gardens. Irrigation is\r\nthe support of all vegetable life here. People were employed in weeding\r\nthe corn-fields; besides the weeds, they picked up the small blades of\r\ncorn, those not likely to be ripe with the rest of the crop, which are\r\ngiven to the sheep and horses. I have seen, however, no horses here. It\r\nis reported amongst the people of the town, that the Touaricks attacked\r\nme and took away all my money. As this continues to spread amongst the\r\noases, I shall soon be murdered by the helping imagination of the people,\r\nat any rate, before I arrive at Tripoli. A gardener tells me, many palms\r\ngrow and bear fruit without being watered, or having any water running\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\nThe Sebhah district embraces four villages besides its town, viz.,\r\nGhortah, Hajrah, Marwees, and Hafat. The population are Moors and Arabs\r\nmixed occasionally with Negro blood; but no black population begins at\r\nthese or the oases hereabouts, as foolishly stated on the map of Capt.\r\nLyon.\r\n\r\n_12th._--We leave to-day to pursue our journey. Oh, what is life! In the\r\nwilderness or the abode of civilization, it is one weary way: but soon,\r\nthank God! to end. This morning I was convinced, that, however bad the\r\ncondition of a people may be, it may still be worse. A poor wretched\r\nwoman of Sebhah came to beg dates from the slaves! from their scanty\r\nallowance. As it mostly happens, the poor give more than the rich in\r\nproportion to their means, so these poor slaves gave the beggar woman a\r\nmost disproportioned quantity of their miserable allowance. A little\r\nvanity there may have been in this, for however badly off we are\r\nourselves, we are not displeased to see some people still worse off, and\r\nare gratified in laying them under some miserable obligation. Left Sebhah\r\nabout 8 A.M., and after three hours' ride came in view of a forest of\r\ndate-palms. This wood of palms is out of the line of route, and extends\r\nfrom Sebhah to Timhanah, a day's journey. Essnousee observed, on arriving\r\nat the palms, \"See, these are all young palms, lately planted; they are\r\nnever watered but bear plenty of dates. It is only in Fezzan the palms\r\nbring dates without water.\" Our route is north, and, as before, over an\r\nundulating gravelly surface. Several heaps of stones in a part of the\r\nroad, evidently to clear it, as it is next to impossible to miss the way\r\nin this part of Sahara. No stones were added to these heaps by us. Our\r\nprecursors, in past times, were much more attentive to clearing routes\r\nthan ourselves.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to record the nasty feelings of the people of these Fezzanee\r\ntowns towards Christians. I found the people a most inhospitable set, and\r\ncould not get from them a drop of milk for love or money. As, however,\r\nthey sent plenty of prepared food every evening to the people of the\r\nghafalah, Essnousee was kind enough to give me a dish or two. I attribute\r\nthis inhospitality to their hatred of the Turks, and the English being\r\nconsidered as the friends of the Turks.\r\n\r\nReached Timhanah at 3 P.M. I was grievously attacked with the tooth\r\nand ear-ache, produced by the strong cold wind which had been\r\nblowing nearly all day. Got some rum and doctored myself, and by\r\nsunset I was enabled to read a little of my Greek Testament. I did\r\nnot go into the town of Timhanah, being so disgusted with the people\r\nof Sebhah. Apparently Timhanah is half the size of Sebhah, and\r\nwalled with mud and stones. The country around offers the usual\r\nprospect of palms and patches of corn cultivation, with wells in\r\neach field for irrigation. These oases are most annoyingly alike,\r\nand one description must serve for all. The inhabitants fancy I am a\r\nTurk, and ask me to speak Turkish. Others shun me as such; and since\r\nthe Turks, in passing these oases, levy upon the inhabitants\r\nhospitality by force, this may be the cause of the little good\r\nfeeling manifested by them to strangers. Essnousee, for whom I am\r\nbeginning to entertain the most intense disgust, amused himself this\r\nevening with most unmercifully beating his slaves. I could not find\r\nout the cause. The females usually catch it most. I cannot tell the\r\nreason, except it be, they are more difficult to reduce to a\r\nregimen, or system of travelling, and are always fond of playing\r\nsome innocent pranks. The lively things certainly make more noise\r\nand botheration than the males. We are to purchase dates here, they\r\nbeing cheap and of good quality. The townspeople come to see me\r\nwrite, but I lose patience with them, knowing them to be such a\r\nnasty set. Bad rulers make bad subjects. The Turks would make any\r\npeople suspicious and inhospitable. However, when I left the place,\r\nsome of them came forward to lend a hand in loading the camel, a\r\nmark of friendship, which showed me they would be hospitable if\r\ntheir hospitality were not abused by the Turks. To my surprise, this\r\nmorning a lad of our ghafalah was struck by a scorpion. I did not\r\nexpect to see scorpions this time of the year. The scorpion was\r\nkilled instantly. It was a small one, and its stroke feeble, for the\r\nlad complained very little, and I heard no more of the matter. In\r\nthe Apocalypse, locusts are represented as striking a man like\r\nscorpions, although they are by nature harmless, so far as wounding\r\nhumankind is concerned. It is well to observe, the Saharan people\r\nalways speak of scorpions as not stinging but striking a man, the\r\nverb used being ‮ضرب‬, \"to beat,\" \"to strike.\" So in chap. ix. 5, it\r\nis said, καὶ ὁ βασανισμὸς αὐτων ὡς βασανισμὸς σχορπίου, ὄταν παίδῃ\r\nἄνθρωπον (\"and their torment [i. e., _inflicted by locusts_] was\r\nas the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man\").\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[116] _Atkah_ is the freedom document. On the liberation of a\r\n    slave, this is signed by the Kady, in the presence of two\r\n    witnesses. A freed slave has it generally about him. But after he\r\n    is known, and has resided long in one place, it is no longer\r\n    thought of. When a batch of slaves are liberated on the death of\r\n    their master, they follow him to his burial, carrying the âtkah\r\n    tied at the top of long rods.\r\n\r\n[117] The prayer to God is a chorus sung by the whole troop. When\r\n    not fatigued, and in good health, the Negresses will sing from\r\n    morning to night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nFROM MOURZUK TO SOCKNA.\r\n\r\n     Continued delays.--Confidence of the Slaves in the Kafer\r\n     (myself).--Supply them with Water.--Negro Youths exhibit\r\n     Sham-Fighting.--Commissions recorded in Journal.--Missionary\r\n     Labour in Central Africa.--Beer Tagheetah.--Palms of\r\n     Ghurmeedah.--A Fezzanee's description of his Country.--Reading on\r\n     the Camel's Back.--Arrive at the Village of Zeghen.--French\r\n     Patent Soup.--Young Camels broken in.--Omm El-Abeed.--Essnousee\r\n     sermonizes on \"What is Good in this World.\"--Various Races of\r\n     Fezzan.--My extreme exhaustion.--The Flogging of the Mandara\r\n     Slave by Essnousee.--Illusions of Desert Sands.--Plateau\r\n     magnifying objects.--Horrid Waste.--How restored from\r\n     Fatigue.--Digging a Well by the order of the Turks.--Slaves\r\n     benighted.--Gibel Asoud.--Well of Ghotfah.--Meet Reinforcements\r\n     of Arab Cavalry.--Arrival at Sockna.\r\n\r\n\r\n_13th._--TO-DAY we came but a short distance, leaving late and encamping\r\nabout half-past 2 P.M. Our object is to allow the camels to feed well,\r\nfor there will now be little or no herbage for them until we arrive at\r\nSockna, a distance of some six days. Respecting all these delays, I can\r\nsay with the most heartfelt sincerity, \"Here is the patience of\r\n(travellers).\" The poor slaves know by instinct the encampment of the\r\nKafer to be a friendly one, notwithstanding the Moors and Arabs persist\r\nungenerously in teaching these poor things to call me kafer, or infidel,\r\nand to look upon me with a species of horror. For water, they come to us\r\ncontinually. To deposit a little bazeen, or flour-pudding, in the evening\r\nuntil the morning, they come to us, finding it secure in our hands. Not\r\nto be beaten, they come to us, crouching down by me, and getting out of\r\nthe way of the whip behind my back. In this way the poor things show\r\ntheir confidence in the man whom their masters teach them to look upon as\r\nan enemy of God! Although the wells are numerous, only a certain supply\r\nof water is carried, and a small quantity is served out to the slaves.\r\nThey frequently require a little water before the time of departing\r\narrives, and come to me, looking up wistfully, putting their fingers to\r\ntheir parched and cracking lips. Said looks after them, and gives them as\r\nmuch of our water as he dares, fearing we shall be short ourselves.\r\n\r\n    \"Should ye ever be one of a fainting band,\r\n    With your brow to the sun, and your feet to the sand,\r\n    Traverse The Desert, and then you can tell,\r\n    What treasures exist in the cold deep well;\r\n    Sink in despair on the red parched earth,\r\n    And then you may reckon what water is worth.\"\r\n\r\nThe Negro youths are practising some of their wild sports and warrior\r\ntricks. Three on one side and three on the other set to work to bring off\r\na sham-fight. The youths made arrows of the branches of the palm, and,\r\nholding up a portion of their clothes for a shield, they throw these\r\npalm-branch arrows with great force and precision, almost always hitting\r\none another. This they continued for some time. As the arrows are thrown\r\nby the party of one side they are picked up by the other. When a man\r\nfalls by a slip or otherwise, the opposing combatants fight over his body\r\nwith great obstinacy and animation. This was the prettiest scene of the\r\nwild fight. The real arrow used in the interior is usually poisoned. The\r\nNegroes are expert in discovering and preparing vegetable poisons, as\r\nmen of all countries are in inventing weapons for their own destruction.\r\nThe Negroes have their Captain Warners as well as we. Bundles of these\r\npoisoned arrows were exposed for sale at Ghat, together with\r\nbullocks'-hide shields. Whilst the lads are thus passing their time, the\r\nlasses are combing, dressing, and oiling their hair, or washing and\r\ncleaning, or decorating themselves, or playing with their little trinkets\r\nof glass beads and chains; thus clearly defining the tastes of the male\r\nand female Negro animal. It is much the same amongst us civilized brutes.\r\nMen fight and quarrel one way or the other, and the women flirt and\r\ndress. The occupation of the women is the more harmless. Perhaps we are\r\ngetting a little better. Men begin to think there is more noble\r\nemployment in the world than cutting one another's throats, and deifying\r\nthe wholesale assassins who destroy them; women, too, seem disposed to\r\nprove that they have something else to attend to, besides setting off and\r\nconserving their beauty. We have with us a youth sent for sale to Tripoli\r\nby the Bashaw of Fezzan, who it seems must dabble in slave-dealing,\r\nnotwithstanding his imprecations against the merchants of Ghadames for\r\nthe same crime. He is from Mandara, and was kidnapped by the Tibboos.\r\nThis is the captain of all the sham-fighters, and the leader and prompter\r\nof all other sports on the way. There is always one who assumes\r\nsuperiority over the rest, in every troop of human beings; so it was in\r\nthe beginning, and so it will ever continue to be.\r\n\r\nI see by my notes I have various commissions to execute--if--if--if I\r\nreturn to Mourzuk _en route_. First for the Sheikh of Bornou, I am to\r\nbring a small coining-machine to make a copper-currency, replacing the\r\npresent inconvenient system of pieces of cotton called Ghubgha[118].\r\nNext, I am to bring Congreve-rockets, by which the Sheikh may set on fire\r\nthe straw-hut cities of his enemies; but I should think a good\r\ndrill-serjeant would be better than rockets. Finally, some instructions,\r\nin the Arabic language, for preparing indigo, and bees'-wax, and tanning\r\nleather. This last memorandum of the commission is infinitely more\r\ngrateful to one's feelings, as promoting the useful arts in Central\r\nAfrica, than either establishing a base currency, or multiplying the\r\nweapons of destruction. For the Bashaw of Fezzan is to be brought a\r\nsplendid gold watch. The Greek Doctor wants an Italian Medical\r\nDictionary, and a small case of surgical instruments; and for Mr.\r\nGagliuffi I am to bring everything which may be useful to him. The Consul\r\nvery justly recommends, the teaching Negroes the useful arts as the only\r\nmeans of permanently extinguishing the traffic in slaves. He also\r\nrecommends the introducing of Missionaries into the Pagan countries,\r\nMandara and Begharmy, beyond and neighbouring to Bornou, as an important\r\nmeans of civilizing Africa. But, it is to be understood, that the\r\nMissionaries should go as merchants, and, like Paul, work with their own\r\nhands at mechanical trades. It must not be a wild-goose chase of empty\r\ndeclamation, but a thoroughly conscientious project, wrought out\r\naccording to the circumstances of the country, with discretion and\r\ncourage. In this way it would, with the blessing of Providence, succeed\r\nadmirably. The Moravians alone have successfully applied themselves to\r\nthis kind of Missionary labour.\r\n\r\nPassed a well this morning, on our left, called Beer Tagheetah. There is\r\nwater in many places where no attempt is made to cultivate the cultivable\r\nsoil. I asked an Arab of Timhanah why more land was not cultivated? \"We\r\nhave no bullocks, no asses; we cannot draw up the water--we want money,\"\r\nwas the reply. This sort of answer is applicable to almost every country\r\nin Europe. Our encampment is at the place called Ghurmeedah. Here are\r\nonly two or three untenanted huts, where the date-watchers sleep or\r\nrepose during the season. This small forest of palms belongs to Zeghen.\r\nTook a little cuscasou with some Arabs who have joined us, being hired by\r\nEssnousee to carry dates for the slaves. Giving an account of their\r\ncountry, they say, \"Fezzan is a country of poor people; it always was so:\r\nwe have only the date-palm. This is our riches. If the sea came up to\r\nFezzan, then we would ship dates for Tripoli; but as it is, they are too\r\nheavy--they don't pay the expense of carrying to Tripoli. We have\r\nbesides, a little corn, but not cattle enough to draw water to increase\r\nthis cultivation. Many of the people live only on dates and hasheesh\r\n(herbs). We eat the ghoteb.\" In the abandoned huts I found three or four\r\nwomen just come from Zeghen. They were collecting and boiling the ghoteb,\r\nwhich they sell in their town; it eats very cooling and pleasant with\r\ndates. If I recollect, it is something like the barilla-plant. I tasted\r\nthe herb, but could make nothing of it. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of\r\nFezzan are apparently healthy and happy. Providence blesses this poor\r\ndish of herbs, and makes it palatable and nourishing.\r\n\r\n_14th._--Rose with the sun's rising, and started with the first\r\nscattering of the bright orient beams. Course over an undulating surface\r\nof mostly sandy soil, but firm to the camel's foot. In various places is\r\nscattered a great quantity of the common black volcanic shingle, and\r\nwhich, indeed, covers a fifth of The Sahara I have traversed. Essnousee\r\ntells me this stone contains iron, for so, reported our countrymen of the\r\ntwo former expeditions in Fezzan. The Turks of Mourzuk assert the same\r\nthing, though not very great authorities in geology. This shingle has\r\ncertainly a most ferruginous appearance. About three hours after leaving\r\nour encampment we passed the town of Semnou on our right. Our people read\r\non the camel's back. Essnousee pretends to devotional reading. I never\r\nattempted reading on the camel, in order to preserve my eyes, though by\r\nno means difficult. An European who has to traverse these Saharan\r\nsolitudes might supply himself with a few entertaining books, in large\r\ntype, and while away many lonely and tedious hours, when riding on the\r\ncamel's back. Only one of the slaves is sick, to whom I give a ride every\r\nmorning. The rest go pretty well--in fact, our short days' journeys,\r\nduring these last several days, are a trifle to us all.\r\n\r\nArrived at Zeghen at 2 P.M. Don't feel very strong. Ought to eat more,\r\nbut can't get meat. Had a good drink of camel's milk this morning. Tired\r\nof cuscasou, and now like bazeen better. Several of the people come to\r\nsee me, apparently more hospitable than those of Sebhah. They are all\r\nvery poor, scarcely existing, ground down to the dust of The Desert. Went\r\ninto the town. People got talking of religion. The presence of a person\r\nof another faith always suggests the subject to these unsophisticated\r\npeople. I declared to them, that as the Great God was \"The Most\r\nMerciful,\" every good man of every nation, be he Mahometan, Christian, or\r\nJew, might expect the Divine favour. This doctrine was too liberal for\r\nsome, others approved. Moors, in all these discussions, speak a good deal\r\nabout hell-fire. They think, at least, this will shake a Christian's\r\ncourage. They are very sensible to corporal torments themselves, like all\r\nbarbarians or semi-civilized people. But, poor idiots, they don't know\r\nthat we denounce them as the future inhabitants of the same\r\nplace,--\"Companions of The Fire.\" A Marabout came and listened, who\r\nevidently was one of the fools so kindly and humanely taken care of by\r\nBarbary people. The idiot had ostrich feathers round his breast, and a\r\ncirclet of large beads in his hands, which he kept telling with a vacant\r\nstare. He begged of me, but I gave him nothing, having nothing to give.\r\nPopulation of Zeghen, about a third or fourth-rate town of these oases,\r\nis estimated at 200 men, 300 women, and 700 children and slaves. There\r\nare always a few more women than men in these Saharan towns. This surplus\r\nof women is kept up by importing female slaves from Central Africa. There\r\nthe men perish in wars, or otherwise are enslaved for the Western Coast,\r\nand a surplus of women is left for the North.\r\n\r\nThis evening arrived the courier from Mourzuk, who took charge of a\r\nsmall packet of French patent soup, which I left behind. Mr. Gagliuffi\r\nhad had this soup three years, and it was still very good. It is\r\npreserved in thin pieces like dried glue. It requires only boiling with a\r\nlittle salt, and then is pretty good. In long Desert journeying it would\r\nbe easy to take a supply of this sort of preserved soup, as well as\r\npotted meat. On the address of the packet was, \"Signore Richardson--Mr.\r\nGagliuffi--God bless him.\"\r\n\r\n_15th._--This morning, at starting, I was very much amused at seeing two\r\nyoung camels loaded for the first time with a few trifling things, to\r\nbreak them in. They are only one year old. The little reprobates cried\r\nand groaned, and grumbled most piteously; one would have thought they\r\nwere about to be killed, with the knife at their throats. The Arabs, to\r\nprevent their crying, throw some sand into their open mouths. By this\r\nlittle bit of barbarity, the poor young things were obliged to cease\r\ncrying to chew the unwelcome bolus of sand. When laden, they started off\r\nas mad, trying to throw off their load. Do they know, by their powerful\r\nand foreseeing instinct, that this was the beginning of their painful\r\nlabours and journeyings? and do they thus resist the imposition of\r\nburthens with all their youthful ardour and strength? A young camel\r\nremains with its mother and sucks a whole year. It is five years before\r\nthe camel attains maturity of growth and strength.\r\n\r\nOur route is north, over what the French call _la terre accidentée_. It\r\nwas the _bonâ fide_ Sahara, and wore its rugged face of desolation. But,\r\nafter continuing five hours, we encamped at the Omm-El-Abeed, or \"Mother\"\r\nor \"Country of Slaves,\" so called probably because the slave-caravans\r\nstop here to take in a good supply of water for four days on the highway\r\nof Tripoli. Whatever its name, this is a fair spot, abounding with\r\nexcellent water near the surface. There are two wells, and both full to\r\noverflowing. The water is slightly impregnated with iron. Herbage around\r\nis abundant, and wild palms give it the appearance of an oasis.\r\nEssnousee, who is a sagacious fellow, justly remarked to me:--\"If this\r\ncountry were in the hands of Christians, they would make it a fruitful\r\ngarden, palms would be planted, corn sown, and houses built.\" The Moorish\r\nmerchants can appreciate the superior industry and intelligence of\r\nEuropeans. Undoubtedly, the presence of abundant good water, and a soil\r\ncomposed of a mixture of sand and earth, (the essential ingredients for a\r\nfruitful oasis,) would, in other hands, soon render this spot a paradise\r\nin Desert. It rejoices my heart to contemplate the future--if perchance\r\nthat future come--when this Saharan region shall fall into the hands of\r\nanother Government, be invaded, circumscribed, and reduced on every side,\r\nand such a conquest over The Desert made by the hand of industry, as to\r\nrender it a garden of the Hesperides, and to blossom as the rose. In\r\nanother century, or a century after that, this may be the case. Even\r\nMoors, the worst people of the world in looking forward to improvements,\r\nhave in many of these oases planted young palms, and already reaped the\r\nbenefit in an increasing crop of dates, although, unfortunately, more\r\nfrom necessity than forethought have they been actuated. What may then be\r\nexpected from men who adopt the principle of progress! Oftentimes I have\r\nconnected, in imagination, the shores of the Mediterranean with the banks\r\nof the Niger, by a series of uninterrupted palmy oases, with jutting\r\nfountains, and silvery streams of living water, and cool shady\r\nresting-places for weary caravans. Hope is still my consolation in\r\ntravelling through this thirsty dreary wilderness. Better to feed the\r\nmind with these expectations, even should they be illusory, than sighing\r\nand groaning over the desolations of Africa.\r\n\r\nThis evening took a little cuscasou with Essnousee. After supper the\r\neternal subject of religion was brought forward by this slave-driver. He\r\ncannot comprehend my travelling, and thinks I must have some secret\r\nmission. He was more surprised when I told him I should visit the New\r\nWorld after exploring Africa, for this shifted his suspicions from\r\nMahometan countries. Essnousee, like others of his countrymen, cannot\r\ncomprehend notions of enterprise and discovery in travel. How should he?\r\nWhat country has a Moor? What purposes of renown and glory can fill him\r\nwith a patriotic ambition? Nevertheless, a Moor has three passions, those\r\nof gain--sensuality--and religion, which latter sentiment often at, or\r\neven before, the close of life, absorbs the other two, yet itself\r\ndegenerating into superstition and fanaticism. These passions make up the\r\nend and compass of the being of a Moor, the objects of all his pursuits\r\nthrough life. On the latter of these sentiments or passions, Haj\r\nEssnousee, a thoroughly bad man himself, took the liberty of addressing\r\nme these words, in reply to my demand of \"What is good in this world?\"\r\n\"If you wish to do a good thing,\" said the slave-driver, \"do this,\r\nabandon your country and your friends. Forget you were born a Christian.\r\nGo to Egypt--there turn Mussulman. Then go to Mecca. There read and\r\nstudy all the day, and all the days of your life. See and hear the time\r\nof prayers announced from El-Kaaba[119]. Pray at Fidger, Subah and Aser,\r\nMugreb and Lailah[120]. Observe well the burying-place where the body of\r\nthe Prophet is laid, and be assured that if you are buried there, you\r\nwill rise up at the Resurrection to Paradise. This is the good work I\r\ncounsel you to do, but you won't do it.\" I smiled at this fine speech,\r\nand asked the slave-merchant to give up his trade, go to Mecca, and carry\r\nout that which he so eloquently recommended me to do. This turning the\r\nthing on himself displeased him, and the zealous preacher dropped his\r\nsermon in a moment.\r\n\r\nFezzan, with its numerous and large oases, offers for investigation to\r\nthe physiologist, the three distinct species or varieties of the human\r\nrace which overspread all Central Africa, viz., The Arabs and Moors, the\r\nTouaricks, and the Negroes,--and these all mixed and blended together, of\r\nall shades of colour, stature, and configuration. The Arabs and Moors\r\nabound this side Mourzuk. Sebhah and Zeghen are all Arabs and Moors. The\r\nTouaricks are found in the Wady Ghurbee, and are occupied chiefly in a\r\npastoral life, leading their flocks through open Desert. Some live in the\r\nvillages of The Wady. But these Touaricks are not subjects of the\r\nchieftains of Ghat. The Negroes begin at Mourzuk, and extend south in all\r\nthe districts of Fezzan, as far as the Tibboos. Ghatroun, I am informed,\r\nhas an entire population of coloured people, under the protection of a\r\nMarabout.\r\n\r\n_16th._--Another day lost. We stop here to-day to take in water, (as if\r\nwe did not arrive soon enough yesterday to take in water for a hundred\r\ntimes our number,) and to let the camels feed. Felt, however, excessively\r\nweak, and very nervous to-day. At one moment, I seemed as if I were\r\nplaced in an exhausting-receiver, and was about to give up the ghost.\r\nIt's perhaps as well for my health, we don't go on quicker. According to\r\nthe report of the Fezzaneers, there is fever in every oasis during the\r\nsummer, and considerable mortality. Eating dates continually in the\r\nsummer must create a great deal of heat in the system, and thus it is not\r\nsurprising that fever prevails.\r\n\r\nEvening, just at sunset, the Mandara slave came near to my encampment and\r\nmumbled something to my Negro servant. Looking at him, I saw he asked\r\nSaid to beg me to do something on his behalf. In a few minutes, a slave\r\nbelonging to another master came up to him and began to console him,\r\nsaying, \"Go, go.\" They both then took up handfuls of sand and scattered\r\nit upon their foreheads and chins, as if performing some incantations to\r\navert an impending evil. This done, they both burst into tears, and\r\nsobbed aloud. By this time, I learnt from Said that Haj Essnousee had\r\nsent for the Mandara slave to beat him. I then asked, \"For what?\" The\r\nslaves replied, \"For nothing.\" This I could not believe. Looking towards\r\nthe encampment of Essnousee, I saw the slave-driver greatly excited, and\r\nheard him call to two other slaves, \"Fetch him, fetch him.\" These slaves,\r\n(I almost cursed them in my heart,) came running to my encampment like\r\ntwo bloodhounds, and seized the wretched slave, their brother in bondage,\r\nand dragged him off to the enraged slave-driver. The poor fellow, from\r\nfear and trembling, could not stand upon his legs, and was held up by his\r\ncaptors. The Mandara slave being brought to Essnousee, and the two\r\ncaptors having pinned him down, this ferocious Moor took him aside and\r\nflogged him with a huge slave-whip until The Desert was literally filled\r\nwith his cries! continuing to flagilate his bare body until he\r\n(Essnousee) was himself exhausted by administering the brutal flogging.\r\nThe Arabs of our caravan, who were near, got upon their legs, from sheer\r\nannoyance at the sound of the whip and the cries of the slave, but, like\r\ndastardly wretches, contented themselves with looking on, silent and\r\nmotionless. I felt, at the time, extreme contempt for what are called\r\n\"the brave and gallant sons of The Desert.\" I was not near enough, on my\r\njourney to Tripoli, to justify any effectual interference on my part.\r\nAfterwards I went up to Haj Essnousee and asked him, why he had flogged\r\nthe slave? He answered still greatly excited, \"He'll not eat; he's a\r\ndevil; it is necessary there should be one devil amongst my slaves.\" His\r\nnephew observed, as a hopeful pupil of his merciless uncle, \"He's a\r\nthief, he robs us.\" This is the only satisfaction I could get; but from\r\nthe rest of the caravan I learnt that the poor Mandara slave was flogged\r\nfor no other reason except to gratify the capricious cruelty of\r\nEssnousee. This Sockna Moor was born to be a slave-dealer and\r\nslave-driver, a cunning ferocity and genuine Moorish sensuality being\r\nimpressed upon his Cain-like countenance. I was enabled to study his\r\ncharacter on our way, but study was scarcely requisite to discover the\r\nmark of the first murderer stamped on his brow. When too indolent to beat\r\nhis slaves he would throw stones at them; when flogging the female\r\nslaves, if he could not succeed in rousing their sensibilities as they\r\ndropped from exhaustion in The Desert, he would poke up their persons\r\nwith a stick. This Saharan villain was thoroughly imbued with the\r\nprinciple of an English duke, \"That he (Haj Essnousee) had a right to do\r\nwhat he liked with his own,\" and did not scruple to mutilate a slave to\r\nsatisfy his demoniac caprice, in spite of its losing half of its price or\r\nvalue in the market. Poor miserables are those pro-slavery writers, who\r\nargue that a man will take care of his slaves because they are his own\r\nproperty! Why did not the imperial tyrants of Rome defend the liberties\r\nof their people, because they were their own people? Neither human nor\r\ndivine law can permit any man, even a good man, to have absolute property\r\nin his fellows, much less a bad man or a tyrant. But Haj Essnousee is not\r\naltogether an unmixed monster; he has something of enterprise and an\r\nactive intelligence about him, to redeem him from complete execration.\r\nSeeing me disconcerted about his whipping the slave, he observed,\r\n\r\n\"There are two fine wells here, have you written them? You must give a\r\ngood account of everything to your Sultan.\"\r\n\r\nI then returned to the other slave-masters, owners of seven slaves, and\r\nsaid, \"Why do you let a poor wretch be flogged to death in this way and\r\nnot interfere?\"\r\n\r\nThey replied, \"Oh, you yourself should interefere; we're frightened at\r\nHaj Essnousee.\"\r\n\r\n_I._--\"You then wish me to interfere,--I, who am a Christian, and an\r\nEnglishman, and we English have no slaves,--and you wish me to meddle\r\nwith your business?\"\r\n\r\nAnother Moor said, \"Ah, Yâkob, we know if it had been a Christian\r\nflogging a Christian, you would have interfered. But we are an accursed\r\nrace, our merchants fear not God. And when one does wrong, another will\r\nnot speak to him, and tell him he does wrong to himself and God.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this we had no more flogging to Sockna. I hinted to these people,\r\nsomething might be said by the English Consul to the Bashaw of Tripoli\r\nabout this flogging work. The remark was probably reported to Essnousee.\r\nI made up my mind, if the poor fellow was flogged again, to get him to\r\nrun away at Tripoli, or into a consulate, and then divulge the affair. It\r\nmay be mentioned here, that two days before arriving at Sockna, I turned\r\nto look at one of the female slaves, who was last of all, and being\r\ndriven along by the whip, with several others, and thought I saw symptoms\r\nof insanity marked in her face. \"Why,\" I observed to the driver, \"this\r\nwoman is mad!\" \"Mad!\" he replied; \"No, she went blind yesterday.\" On\r\nexamining her, I found she was both blind and mad from over-driving. What\r\na happiness if the poor creature had died or been flogged to death! She\r\nwould then have escaped two of the heaviest of human calamities, as well\r\nas the curse of slavery.\r\n\r\n_17th._--On leaving Omm-El-Abeed, after a couple of hours, we traversed\r\nsome sand hillocks, all dismounting to lighten the camels. The sand\r\ndeceived my vision frequently in walking. Looking at some heaps over\r\nwhich I was pacing, I imagined them at a considerable distance off, when,\r\nto my amazement, I found them under my feet in an instant. It might be\r\npartly owing to the dizziness of riding. The sand was a deep shining\r\nred. At another time a hillock of sand seemed projecting near my face,\r\nand putting out my hand to feel it, I found nothing but thin air. More\r\nsand encumbers this route than that between Ghadames and Ghat. After a\r\ncouple of hours of sand we ascended an elevated rocky plateau, continuing\r\nour route north till night. This was a long, long day, full of weariness\r\nand misery. Nothing for the camels to eat, and we were obliged to give\r\nthem dates. The poor slaves drooped and were dumb. The frown of God was\r\nstamped on this region! For--\r\n\r\n    \"Here rocks alone and trackless sands are found,\r\n    And faint and sickly winds for ever howl around.\"\r\n\r\n_18th._--Continued our course over the plateau. It was now become hard\r\nsun-baked earth, and bare of herbage. As upon the plain of the celebrated\r\nTenezrouft, objects here become greatly magnified in the distance,\r\nexceeding the most powerful magnifying lens. In the simple and bold\r\nlanguage of our camel-drivers, \"A man becomes a camel, and a camel\r\nbecomes a mountain.\" Some bones of a camel, at a distance of less than a\r\nquarter of a mile, looked like a living camel going along with several\r\npeople, the white bones representing the burnouses of the men. A small\r\nwhite stone, not ten inches high, appeared to be several feet in height,\r\nat the distance of a quarter of an hour's ride. And so of the few other\r\ndiscernible objects on this wide expanse of optical delusion. Mirage was\r\nseen at times, but nothing pretty. We encamped late, midway through the\r\nvast plateau, when shadowy night began to establish her sable throne, in\r\n\"rayless majesty,\" over this silent, sombre Desert. On such a horrid\r\nwaste as this, when crime and murder shall have depopulated the world,\r\nthe last man will breathe his last sigh! Another long and weary day was\r\nthis. With difficulty could I descend from my camel, and when I did, I\r\nwas unable to stand. My plan is, immediately on descending from the camel\r\nto take a table-spoonful of rum and swallow it neat. This restores me to\r\na consciousness of the objects around me, and then I lie down an hour,\r\nwhilst supper is preparing. An hour's rest generally enables me to get up\r\nand walk. If restored sufficiently, I go to chat half an hour with my\r\ncompanions of travel; if not, I never rise till the next morning. I found\r\nthe rum of essential advantage in restoring me to consciousness. I am\r\nindebted to the Greek Doctor for it. One bottle lasted me from Mourzuk to\r\nfour days within reaching Tripoli.\r\n\r\n_19th._--Continued the route of the plateau till the afternoon, when with\r\na low range of mountains on our left, we entered a hilly undulating\r\ncountry, having stones, some good sized blocks, scattered thick over all\r\nthe surface of the ground. In the small intervening valleys were a few\r\nacacias, and a little herbage for our camels. But behold a wonder! At\r\nnoon, we passed through one of these small valleys, when to my thorough\r\nand complete amazement, we found a few men and a tent pitched. Doing\r\nwhat? Oh, wonder of wonders! These men were digging a well at the command\r\nof the Turks! Formerly the Turks in Barbary did nothing but fill up the\r\nwells, or let them be filled up. Another day has dawned over \"the spirit\r\nof their dream.\" The Ottomans now begin to see that they must step\r\nforward in the march of improvement, or be blotted out of existence, as\r\na nation of the earth. This is the most difficult part of the route in\r\ncoming up from Tripoli to Mourzuk, and the object of digging the well is\r\nto reduce the distance where water may be taken in to two and a half or\r\nthree days, instead of four or five, which is now the case. The new well\r\nis already dug very deep, and I am sorry this extraordinary enterprise of\r\nthe Turks, that of digging a well in The Desert, has not yet been crowned\r\nwith success. Water would be found at last, but I have my misgivings\r\nabout their perseverance. The French scientific officers, who have\r\nexamined the Saharan districts of Algeria, are of opinion, that Artesian\r\nwells might be bored through every part of The Desert, and all these vast\r\nsolitudes be linked together with chains of wells. Nothing is too great\r\nfor the enterprising genius of man!\r\n\r\nWe encamped late in one of these valleys. The male slaves went to fetch\r\nwood. They were benighted, and could not return, or find their way back.\r\nA horse-pistol was fired three times, and these reports brought them into\r\nthe encampment. Our Moors recommend me, when at any time benighted in The\r\nDesert, never to move, but wait for some sign or signal, or report of\r\nfirearms, or until a person be sent in pursuit of me. This the slaves\r\ndid, and were enabled to return. Had they wandered about, they would\r\nprobably have got a long way out of the track, or from the encampment,\r\nand not heard the report of the pistol. To show the improvidence of our\r\nMoors, we had only just powder enough for these three discharges.\r\n\r\n_20th._--Continued through the undulating country until we got fairly\r\namidst massy mountainous groups of considerable altitude. These mountains\r\nare covered with small blocks of black (iron) stone, and ferruginous\r\nshingle. These immense groups are called Gibel Asoud, \"Black Mountain.\" I\r\nwent, on foot, with Essnousee and his slaves, \"the short-cut,\" or\r\nmountain foot-path of Nifdah, leaving the camels to go round by the\r\nother, or camel route, of En-Nishka. I found, however, this \"short-cut\" a\r\nvery long one, and dreadfully fatiguing. I recommend all travellers never\r\nto believe in the short-cuts of the Arabs, for they are sure to be\r\ndeceived. These people have no ideas of distance or time. Only conceive a\r\nweak and exhausted traveller, like myself, climbing up and down groups of\r\nmountains for two weary hours. At length we descended into the valley\r\nwhere is the well of Ghotfa. We only remained an hour to rest, and drank\r\na little water, not encamping at the well. We proceeded to meet the\r\ncamels by the camel route. On overtaking them, we encamped at night-fall.\r\nThis was another long and weary day, and made our fourth from\r\nOmm-El-Abeed. Our slaves were exhausted to the uttermost; their song,\r\nwith which they were wont to cheer themselves, was never heard: their\r\nplaintive choruses never broke over the silence of Desert! It was to-day,\r\nwhilst threading the precipitous mountain-path, I observed the unhappy\r\nnegress, who went blind and mad by overdriving. Our route to-day is\r\ngraphically described by Denham, and the passage being short, I shall\r\ncopy it. \"We had now to pass the Gibel Asoud, or Black Mountain. The\r\nnorthernmost part of this basaltic chain commences on leaving Sockna. We\r\nhalted at Melaghi (or place of meeting); immediately at the foot of the\r\nmountain is the well of Agutifa (Ghotfa,) and from hence, probably, the\r\nmost imposing view of these heights will be seen. To the south, the\r\nmountain-path of Nifdah presents its black overhanging peaks, the deep\r\nchasm round which the path winds, bearing a most cavern-like appearance.\r\nA little to the west, the camel-path, called En-Nishka, appears scarcely\r\nless difficult and precipitous, the more southern crags close the\r\nlandscape, while the foreground is occupied by the dingy and barren Wady\r\nof Agutifa, with the well immediately overhung by red ridges of limestone\r\nand clay, the whole presenting a picture of barrenness not to be\r\nperfectly described either by poet or painter.\" By this craggy gorge the\r\nplateau above-mentioned is entered, and it is frequently by such gorges,\r\nwhich seem to be the buttresses of the plateaus, that the elevated\r\nSaharan plains are approached.\r\n\r\nAbout noon we met a reinforcement of Arab cavalry on the way to Mourzuk,\r\nto intercept the son of Abd-El-Geleel, in the event of his returning\r\nduring the spring to Egypt or the Syrtis. I found the reputed six reduced\r\nto two hundred men, and most _triste_ cavaliers, mounted on still more\r\nmiserable horses. The stories which we have read of the fondness of the\r\nArab for his horse were sadly belied by the fact of the condition of this\r\ntroop. Indeed, an Arab treats his horse much in the same way as his\r\nwife--most miserably bad. This _triste_ troop, worthy the command of the\r\nKnight of La Mancha, was a faithful picture of the wretched condition of\r\nthe province of Tripoli. On passing me, some saluted, and others stared.\r\nSaid met a former fellow-slave of the island of Jerbah going under the\r\nprotection of this escort. The freed slave gave a confused account of\r\nthe last act of abolition of the Bey of Tunis. He was on his way to\r\nBegharmy, his native country. I observed a Turkish officer, having a sort\r\nof sedan-chair, swinging on the back of a camel, a good thing for an\r\nEuropean female travelling in these countries, and not a bad thing for a\r\nworn-down emaciated tourist like myself. I envied him this Desert luxury.\r\n\r\n_21st._--Started with the first solar rays, and as we journeyed on, the\r\nvalley of Ghotfa widened, till we found ourselves traversing an immense\r\nplain, at the extreme north of which, and on the west, we saw the palms\r\nof Sockna. We had seen them yesterday indistinctly from the peaks of\r\nGibel Asoud. We continued our route for four hours, when we arrived at\r\nSockna. There is still a goodly number of palms, notwithstanding the\r\nthousands destroyed by Abd-El-Geleel when besieging this place. The\r\ntrunks of the destroyed palms still remain, and look like a leafless\r\nforest in winter, or as if blasted with lightning. But these Arabs,\r\neither in building up or in throwing down, never do their work\r\neffectually. Tired of their work of destruction, they thus, happily, left\r\nthe inhabitants a considerable number of palms, affording a good stock of\r\ndates. We were met near the gates of the city by the friends and\r\nrelatives of our people. Some of them gave me a salute, but I am now so\r\nhalf-Moorishly dressed, or Turk-like, that I am not readily distinguished\r\nas a Christian. When within the walls, the heat and the refraction of the\r\nsun's rays from the stone walls were so intense, that I really thought my\r\nface would have been burnt up. With a little patience we were domiciled\r\nin the dark room of an empty house, where I went to bed at 3 P.M., and\r\ndid not get up till the evening of the next day. During these hot sultry\r\nglaring days in Desert, how grateful is darkness,--how much better than\r\nlight. On arriving at a station, I find it the best thing possible to lie\r\ndown an hour or two, and, if in a town, where we are to remain a few\r\ndays, to go to bed at once. This is the only way to recover effectually,\r\nand far better than food or stimulants. Since leaving Tripoli I have not\r\nperformed a more arduous journey than these last five days. Our days'\r\njourneys were at least fourteen or fifteen hours long. In summer it\r\nrequires seven days, or five short days and five long nights. On the\r\nroad, there were no animals or living creatures, except a few lizards,\r\nstarting from under the camel's feet, as if to look who we were, and ask\r\nwhy we had come to disturb their solitary basking in the sun; and a few\r\nswallows, which seemed to follow us to the well, or to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, whence they will now skim their airy way to the more\r\ntemperate clime of Europe. I think, also, we saw two birds not unlike\r\nsnipes. But we shall soon get within the region of birds and beasts.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118] A _ghubgha_ is a measure of six feet long, and measures\r\n    pieces of cotton six feet long (and three inches broad), from\r\n    which circumstance the currency is thus named.

Essnousee called, and we went to see the Turkish Governor in\r\nthe evening. The Governor is called Kaed, Bey, and generally Mudeer\r\nSuleiman, by the people. We found his Excellency in the midst of his\r\nbusiness, squatting tailor-like upon a raised bench of mud and lime,\r\ncovered with a carpet. The Mudeer seemed happy enough, his secretary\r\nsitting below at his feet. He was very glad to see me, \"For people,\" he\r\nobserved, \"don't see Christians every day in this horrid country.\" The\r\nMudeer made me mount his throne by his side, giving me his superfine\r\ncushion to repose on, talking all the time; \"Foolish men, you\r\nChristians, to come to these horrible countries.\" From this elevated\r\nposition I was enabled to survey his Excellency's receiving apartment,\r\nwith the adjoining one. It was a rich and varied scene; only Dickens\r\ncould do justice to any description of these state-rooms of the Castle of\r\nSockna. We had first the Mudeer, a little dirty mean-looking Turk, most\r\nshabbily attired, with some fifty or sixty winters on his Ottoman brow,\r\nbut with a sufficiently good-natured face. The Mudeer has been only two\r\nmonths in Sockna. He was sent from Mourzuk, and enjoys the confidence of\r\nHasan Belazee. Before him there was another Turkish Kaed of Sockna. The\r\ncontinual jealousies and rivalries in these towns prevent the Pacha from\r\nappointing them one of their native Sheikhs. The Mudeer has been four\r\nyears in Barbary, but, like all the Turks, speaks Arabic very badly, with\r\na most detestable accent. The apartment of the Kaed is a portion of the\r\nCastle, the passages to which are a mass of ruins, and you are afraid of\r\nthe walls or ceilings of dilapidated rooms tumbling on your head. Sockna,\r\nlike Mourzuk, has its Castle, separated from the town. The Mudeer's room\r\nis a wretched dirty barn, with a large mud fire-place in the centre.\r\nAround it are now seated a number of Moors, talking violently and\r\nquarrelling. The Kaed cannot understand them, and calls out, \"What is it?\r\nwhat is it?\" \"Oh, nothing,\" they scream out in turn, \"we're only talking\r\namongst ourselves.\" The Turk turns to me:--\"Christian, I am a Kaed of\r\nbeasts, not men, Drink your coffee now.\" There is always a great mixture\r\nof freedom and awe, as it may happen, in the intercourse between the\r\nTurks and Moors. But the prime feature of the scene now under\r\nconsideration, is the Sockna doxy, whom the little dirty Turk has\r\ncloseted in an adjoining room. At first she peeps out, but seeing only a\r\nChristian has come in, she becomes more familiar, and at last sallies out\r\nboldly, and begins romping with the Kaed's Negro lad. This is a great\r\nlout of a fellow, who can't keep from grinning. The Nigger lout is\r\ndressed in the clothes of the new Turkish troops, and, as might be\r\nexpected, there is a rent behind, from which issues his dirty linen, in\r\nall its nasty splendour. This the doxy now seizes hold of, to the\r\ninfinite amusement of his Excellency the Governor, his Secretary, and\r\nvarious courtiers, as likewise myself. The lady herself is not quite a\r\nDesert maiden, skipping like a young roe over the mountains, in untutored\r\ninnocence or coyish bashfulness. She is young, it is true, but full-blown\r\nand bloated, very big about, and excessively dirty and nasty. The\r\nfavourite of the Mudeer is besides almost as black as a Negress, with a\r\npock-marked face. After dodging about with the Negro clown some ten\r\nminutes, her eye catches the shape of a huge ill-looking Turkish fellow,\r\nwalking heavily into our apartment, or hall of audience, and the Moorish\r\ndamsel immediately retires to her private boudoir.\r\n\r\nI was not aware of the presence in Sockna of another Turk. He is in\r\ncharge of a convoy of provisions for the troops of Mourzuk, consisting of\r\neighty camels laden with oil, and rice, and mutton fat, boiled down. The\r\nconvoy has been detained ten days for want of camels. The officer had\r\nbeen on as far as Ghotfa Wady, and returned, his miserable camels\r\ndropping and dying. These provisions are conveyed at the expense of the\r\nprincipal towns through which the convoy passes. The discussion going on\r\nto-day between the Kaed and the Sockna people, was about obtaining the\r\nrequisite number of camels. The Kaed I now heard exclaim, \"By G--d, after\r\nto-morrow the camels must go!\" The people, \"Impossible! they will die,\r\nthey will die.\" I could obtain no news from the Turk escorting the\r\nconvoy. He was an ignorant beast. But, curious enough, the fellow was\r\ndressed as much like an European as he could well be so travelling, with\r\nneckcloth, jacket, trousers strapped over black shoes, and a large pair\r\nof leather gloves, which he told me he found very useful in keeping the\r\nsun from burning his hands.\r\n\r\nDuring my interview, the circumstance of Abd-El-Geleel cutting down the\r\npalms of the suburbs because the Sockna people would not surrender to his\r\nsummons, or acknowledge his authority, was mentioned. The number cut\r\ndown, by the besieging Sheikh, from 20,000 was now raised to 120,000. Of\r\ncourse, this is exaggeration. Unfortunately, however, the Sheikh\r\ndestroyed nearly all the best palms, those bearing most delicious fruit,\r\nand which palms have rendered Sockna dates so celebrated, whilst he left\r\nall the worst to spite the people. It will require seven years merely to\r\nreplace them as fruit-bearing palms, and thirty or fifty years to mature\r\npalms yielding fruit of the quantity and quality of those destroyed. This\r\nit is which fills all Sockna people with a thirst of vengeance to\r\nextirpate root and branch the family of Abd-El-Geleel. The people\r\nthemselves have offered Government to defray the expense of an expedition\r\nto Bornou, to cut off his son and all the Oulad Suleiman. Essnousee, a\r\ngood patriot, swears he will not rest until he has had vengeance upon the\r\nOulad Suleiman; yet he is afraid to go to Bornou again whilst they are\r\nthere. He says:--\"We (Sockna people) muster 2,000 men, all fighting men,\r\nnot women or chickens, like the people of Ghadames. We fight like the\r\nFrench. Our country is like France. The Bashaw sends no troops to our\r\nassistance. He knows we can defend ourselves.\" It is a fact they have no\r\ntroops here, although Sockna is the most important town of these upper\r\nprovinces. Since the conquest of Algiers by the French, the Moors think\r\nFrance the greatest military nation upon the face of the earth. If we\r\nreckon the adult males of Sockna at the half of Essnousee's estimate, the\r\ngeneral population will be something like this amount:--\r\n\r\nMen                  1,000 souls\r\nWomen                1,500 \"\r\nChildren and slaves  3,000 \"\r\n                     -----\r\n            Total    5,500 \"\r\n\r\nSockna is often spoken of as distinct from the districts of Fezzan, and\r\nso it really is; but others include both it and Bonjem within the circle\r\nof these clusters of oases, forming one province. The Turkish Kaed is\r\nmore or less dependant on the Bashaw of Mourzuk. His salary is not very\r\nextravagant, twenty-five dollars per mensem. His Excellency may make a\r\nlittle besides on his own account, for this is hardly enough to keep him.\r\nSockna is placed in 29° 5′ 36″ north latitude, and has always been an\r\nemporium of trade on the ancient line of communication between Northern\r\nand Central Africa. In many respects Sockna is like Ghadames. The\r\nprincipal inhabitants are a few rich merchants; provisions are scarce,\r\neverything being imported, as the gardens afford but a scanty supply of\r\nedible products, and all things are extremely dear. Leo mentions that, in\r\nhis times, both Ghadames and Fezzan were dear places, and food scarce.\r\n\r\n_23rd._--Much better to-day in health, and rose early. Wrote several\r\nletters, which were not sent on, curiosities in their way, and scarcely\r\nnow legible. Afternoon sent a letter by the Shantah (courier) to Mr.\r\nGagliuffi. It will reach Mourzuk in eight days. A letter is also eight\r\ndays getting to Tripoli, in the opposite direction. This evening all the\r\ntown was occupied in buying a few sheep. What people for business are\r\nthese Moors! The sheep were brought out, one by one, and bid for, as at\r\nan auction. They were cheap, from two and a half dollars to three each.\r\n\r\nCalled upon some Sockna ladies, whose acquaintance I made through the\r\nnephew of Essnousee. They were his relations, and received us very\r\nkindly, _en famille_. These ladies were occupied with worsted embroidery,\r\nat which they earn a few paras. One is a Maraboutah, or Maraboutess. She\r\nreads and writes a little, and this, with a mind prone to religious\r\nideas, constitutes her a saint. Few are the Moorish or Arab female\r\nsaints, for woman is hardly dealt with by the Mahometan faith. There is a\r\ncelebrated tutelary goddess, or Maraboutah, near the city of Tunis, who\r\nis invoked by all the women of the country, and a pilgrimage is made to\r\nher shrine every morning. The remarkable circumstance about this Sockna\r\nMaraboutess is, that she is very weak about the loins and cannot walk\r\nupright, being frequently carried about. She says, and the people confirm\r\nher testimony, she has \"holy marks\" upon her, imprinted by some\r\nsupernatural being; I think the angel Gabriel was mentioned. This reminds\r\nme of the \"Stigmata\" of Saint Francis of Assisi, for doubting which\r\n\"canonical fact,\" Pope Ugolino was very near anathematizing the Bishop of\r\nOlmutz. I therefore shall not doubt this prodigy, equally well\r\nauthenticated, lest I incur the excommunication of the good people of\r\nSockna. I had not the pleasure of seeing the \"holy marks\" of the\r\nMaraboutess, they being imprinted on an unobserved portion of her body,\r\nbut I cannot question their existence. It is wonderful (a far greater\r\nprodigy!) what are the analogies of religion and superstition. How like\r\nthe feeling and the sentiment! and in this case the very corporal marks\r\nof the body! I asked the Maraboutess if she would prefer the use of her\r\nlimbs to these \"holy marks.\" She answered very quietly and properly, \"As\r\nGod wills, so I will.\" The Sockna saint then put to me this question, \"If\r\nthe English knew and worshipped God?\" How many times has this question\r\nbeen asked! And yet we, in the pride of our conceit, imagine that we\r\nmonopolize all religion, as well as all virtue and science, presuming all\r\nthe world knows it, and recognizes our superiority. My Maraboutess was\r\npleased to hear that the English knew God.\r\n\r\n_24th._--Copied a letter or two. Since my return, looking over the\r\npublished journal of the Bornou expedition, I find this paragraph under\r\nthe rubric of Sockna. \"And in this way we entered the town: the words\r\nInglesi! Inglesi! were repeated by a hundred voices from the crowd. This,\r\nto us, was highly satisfactory, as we were the first English travellers\r\nin Africa who had resisted the persuasion that a disguise was necessary,\r\nand who had determined to travel in our real character as Britons and\r\nChristians[121],\" &c. \"In trying to make ourselves appear as Mussulmans,\r\nwe should have been set down as real impostors.\" This is a most\r\nextraordinary passage. The reader will hardly believe, or really cannot\r\nbelieve after this, that these very parties themselves were circumcised\r\nand attended the mosques. But such was the case; I had it from\r\nunquestionable authority. This is altogether too bad. A little decorating\r\nof an incident, or a conversation, I imagine, is allowed to the\r\ntraveller, but this circumstance can hardly be passed by without\r\nanimadversion. However, when this was written, the most conscientious man\r\nof the party (Oudney) was dead. Clapperton did not write this portion of\r\nthe journal: for its composition Denham alone seems to be responsible. I\r\nshall add no more, thanking God, that, with all my follies, I did not\r\ncommit such a folly, as first to ape the Mussulman, and then repudiate it\r\nin print before the world.\r\n\r\n_25th._--Took a walk and went to see the Kaed. His Excellency was sitting\r\noutside, washed and clean shaved, for once whilst I saw him, with a thin\r\nwhite burnouse thrown over his shoulders. It was a saint's day with him.\r\nHis Excellency presented to me a cup of coffee without sugar, but,\r\nTurk-like, when indulging in their dreamy taciturnity, did not open his\r\nlips. However I had nothing to say to him, nor he to me. Afterwards I\r\nstrolled through the suburbs to botanize. Visited the nearest garden, and\r\nfound the slaves occupied in irrigating it. An old Moor gave me a little\r\nhorticultural information. It requires twelve years for growing a good\r\nfruit-bearing palm; but, he admitted, a palm might bear fruit within\r\nseven or eight years. Observed a male palm. Instead of white flowers\r\nwhich the female palm has at this season, the male has enormously long\r\nbroad hard pods, but also contains flowers. When the flowers are fit for\r\ngermination the pods will burst. The flowers are then thrown over the\r\nfemale palm to produce impregnation. The madder-root is here cultivated;\r\nit is watered every third day. The leaves are cropped often, but the root\r\nrequires three years to come to perfection. Wheat and barley are watered\r\nin Sockna every other day. Observed the tree called gharod, or gharoth,\r\nor gurd; it bears a seed-pod which is used in tanning leather, from its\r\ngreat astringency. In all the Sockna gardens this tree abounds. It is a\r\nspecies of mimosa, with a yellow flower, and small delicate leaves like\r\nthe acacia. It is a pretty tree, high, and spreading, perhaps twenty feet\r\nin height. The seed-pod is sold one quarter dollar the Fezzan kael, or\r\nmeasure, half a peck or so. The gurd is also employed medicinally. I was\r\nglad to see several young palms recently planted. I love progress;\r\neverything in the shape and style of progress delights me. Would to God\r\nthe entire Desert was covered with palms. But man would be just as\r\ncorrupt and unthankful! Being shut up in a dark room three or four days,\r\nI felt the sun disagreeable, paining my eyes. In returning, I stopped at\r\na school and wrote for the boys,\r\n\r\n  ‮بسم الله الرحمان الرحيم ربّ واحد وقادراً‬\r\n\r\nwhich delighted them beyond measure.\r\n\r\nA man, ran away to-day with his three camels, not liking Government work,\r\nwhich is usually performed by Moors and Arabs for the Turks at a price\r\nless than nothing. Some of the Kaed's officers went in pursuit of him.\r\nEvening, called on the Kaed, and found his flaming concubine extended at\r\nher full length upon his elevated seat of authority. His Excellency\r\nhimself, meanwhile, had stepped out of the Castle to look after the\r\ncamels. The Bashaw of Mourzuk has sent him a wigging letter for the delay\r\nin sending up the convoy of provisions. Picked up several old charms in\r\nmy room to-day. They had been placed over the threshold of the door to\r\nkeep out the Evil One. Sometimes they are tied round the necks of camels,\r\nand even placed on trees, especially at the time when bearing fruit, for\r\nthe purpose of preserving the camel from mange, or the tree from blight.\r\nThese talismans usually have a diagram of this and other shapes, with\r\ncertain Arabic signs, letters, words, and sentences, written within and\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that some of the signs are Greek letters. I brought with\r\nme three of these charms from The Desert; one to obtain me a good\r\nreception from the English Sultan on my return; another to conduct me\r\nsafely to Timbuctoo, should I be disposed to attempt the journey; and the\r\nthird to procure for me a pretty wife. My charms have not yet compassed\r\nthese various interesting objects, but they infallibly will do so. The\r\ntaleb who wrote them gets his living by writing charms, and is very\r\nsuccessful in his craft. His paper squibs rarely miss fire, and when they\r\ndo it is not the fault of the charms but that of the person who wears\r\nthem. It is necessary to kiss them frequently and fervently, and repeat\r\nover them the name of God[122].\r\n\r\n_26th._--We were to have started to-day, but, as usual, delay. Time is\r\nnot the estate of these people; rather it is their lavish, valueless\r\nwaste. Called early on his Excellency. Coffee without sugar. His\r\nExcellency very merry, because he had sent off the oil, grease, and rice\r\ncaravan. What a pother it was--it was like the starting of an expedition\r\nto conquer all Central Africa! His Excellency's concubine still occupies\r\nthe seat of honour, where she frequently goes to sleep. The courtiers of\r\nhis Excellency wink at this little peccadillo. Essnousee remarked to me\r\nit was all right; \"The Mudeer must have some sort of a wife.\" Had some\r\nconversation with an intelligent Moor on the trade of Sockna. It appears\r\nthe merchants are in the same predicament as those of Ghadames. They are\r\nall without capital, and are virtually commission-agents of the Jewish\r\nand Christian merchants in Tripoli. They receive their goods on giving\r\nbills for six, nine, and twelve months. These goods they carry to Mourzuk\r\nand Ghat, exchanging them for slaves and other produce of the interior.\r\nAfterwards they return to Tripoli, sell their slaves and goods, pay off\r\ntheir old debts, and contract new engagements. Meanwhile they have\r\nscarcely a para to call their own. Therefore European merchants, aided by\r\nnative Jews, are the _bonâ fide_ supporters of the traffic of slaves in\r\nSahara.\r\n\r\nVisited my dearest lady-saint, or Maraboutess, this evening.\r\n\r\n_The Saint._--\"In a short time I am going to _Beit Allah_ ('house of\r\nGod,' or Mecca).\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" I replied.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there I shall repose under the shadow of the Holy Place, resting my\r\npoor broken limbs and spending my days in fervent prayer, preparing\r\nmyself for heaven:\" continued the pious lady.\r\n\r\n_The Traveller._--\"What shall you do in Paradise?\"\r\n\r\n_The Lady._--\"I shall eat and drink well, and be dressed in silk.\"\r\n\r\n_The Traveller._--\"Shall you have a husband?\"\r\n\r\n_The Lady._--\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n_The Traveller._--\"Shall you bear children!\"\r\n\r\n_The Lady._--\"No.\"\r\n\r\n_The Traveller._--\"Where is Paradise?\"\r\n\r\n_The Lady._--\"God knows, you don't know[123].\"\r\n\r\nThis good amiable lady is somewhat _spirituelle_ for a Mooress, and\r\nmakes lively and apposite remarks on other things, as well as\r\nreligion. The Maraboutess may be twenty-five or thirty years of age,\r\nnot good-looking, neither disagreeable. A dark complexion, a\r\nprominent aquiline nose, a fine gazelle-like eye, and hard-looking\r\nfeatures are overshadowed with a _triste_ and melancholy expression,\r\nfrom the circumstance of her being continually an invalid. I saw the\r\npoor thing was so weak that she could not stand upright. The saint\r\nsaid, with a heavy sigh, as she attempted to move about, \"If I were\r\nto go to Tripoli, would you give me a ride on your camel?\" I\r\nanswered, \"Every morning a couple of hours,\" during which time I\r\nalways walk. She then complained of her poverty. She did not know\r\nhow she should get money enough to go on her pilgrimage to Mecca. If\r\nGod had given her the strength of others, she would have walked\r\nbare-foot over The Desert. I consoled her by saying, that, being a\r\nsaint, all the pious Moslems would relieve her. She would get a ride\r\nfrom one and another, and God would soon help her over the dreary\r\nDesert. The Maraboutess was busy embroidering in coloured worsted,\r\nchiefly the bodies of frocks, which are worn by brides on their\r\nmarriage-days, as well as by lady Mooresses on other festivals. In\r\nten days she earns two shillings, the price of one embroidered\r\nfrock. She has always more than she can do, for the women of Sockna\r\nconsider garments made by her, \"holy robes,\" and keep them all their\r\nlife-time. For the rest, she, poor thing, lives on alms. She asked,\r\nof course, many questions about women in Christian lands, and was\r\nvery much surprised to hear that the supreme ruler of England was a\r\nwoman. The Maraboutess observed, however, in her character as such,\r\n\"What a pity she (the Queen of England) was not the daughter of\r\nMahomet, like Fatima!\" The saintess then asked if Her Majesty had\r\nany children, and was glad to hear she had so many. Three or four\r\nchildren is a good number for women in these oases. She was puzzled\r\nto know why I was not married. I told her I could not carry about a\r\nwife in Sahara. Another woman, listening, observed, \"Why, you\r\nfoolish one, leave her at home till you return.\" These ladies then\r\nspoke of religious rites, and asked me if a Christian, when he was\r\nburied, was placed on his knees. This notion they have got from our\r\nhabits of prayer. Moslems never kneel, properly speaking, at prayer.\r\nTheir attitudes at prayer are in style and essence, prostration. The\r\nladies, growing bolder, began to speak of the \"Bad Place,\" the\r\n_ultima thule_ of Moorish discussion with Christians, imitating the\r\nfire of perdition with their hands and mouth, wafting the air with\r\nthose, and blowing and puffing with this, and then asked me how I\r\nshould like \"The Fire\" (‮النار‬). But I returned, \"Christians say\r\nall Mohammedans will go into that fire.\" This greatly shocked them,\r\nand they asked if I thought so likewise. I replied, \"All who fear\r\nGod, and are good to their neighbour, may expect to see Paradise, if\r\nthere be one.\" \"Ah, that's good!\" these proselyting ladies\r\nexclaimed. The Maraboutess was, however, more thoughtful. \"Do you\r\ndoubt there is a Paradise?\" she asked, looking me full in the face.\r\n\r\n_I._--\"There must be such a place, at least let us hope so; for this is a\r\nbad world, and everybody in it is miserable--Sultans and Dervishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"God is great!\" exclaimed the Maraboutah. She then begged for medicine to\r\ncure her, for although she had stigmata like St. Francis, she would\r\nrather be cured of them. I recommended her the baths in Tripoli, and to\r\nput herself under the treatment of the English doctor. \"Oh,\" she added,\r\n\"send me some medicine, and I'll give you some milk.\" Then the poor\r\nthing, groaning with an attack of pain, continued, \"Do, make haste.\" I\r\ncould do nothing for the poor sufferer. On returning to my house, I sent\r\nher some cream-of-tartar, and received from her some milk immediately,\r\nshowing her high sense of gratitude.\r\n\r\n_27th._--Visited the little dirty Kaed. He gave me dates' syrup to drink.\r\nIt was more delicious than honey This syrup is made by pouring fresh\r\nwater on fresh dates, and covering up the bowl in which they are placed,\r\nallowing it to stand a night. Only one of the species of the Sockna\r\ndates, but that of the most exquisite quality, will produce this Saharan\r\nambrosia.\r\n\r\nGenerally, if dates are steeped in water, they will not produce syrup,\r\nand only get a little soft. People never wash dates. They say it deprives\r\nthem of their fine fresh and peculiar date-flavour. When the Mudeer\r\nhanded me the bowl to drink the syrup, he observed to the Moors and his\r\nprecious doxy, sitting wantonly by his side, \"The Christians are fine\r\npeople. If in Sockna you give them a cup of coffee, or a few dates, and\r\nsee them afterwards in Tripoli they will make you many compliments, and\r\nbe very kind to you.\" This remark was made spontaneously, having no\r\nselfish end. The old Turk was too much of a gentleman in his way to allow\r\nsuch a sordid calculation to enter his mind at the time. I may mention\r\nhere, a woman observed when I visited the Maraboutess, (addressing me),\r\n\"You must send the medicine, for a Christian _mou yakidtheb_ (never\r\nlies).\" It is a pity that these people, who have discernment enough to\r\nsee at times the moral superiority of Christians, should not look a\r\nlittle below the surface and inquire into its cause. Not, however, that\r\nall Europeans, (or myself,) deserve these high compliments of gratitude\r\nand love of truth, although, compared to Moors and Arabs, we are\r\ncertainly far their superiors in morals. The little dirty Turk had as\r\nusual his fair concubine installed on the seat of honour. Sockna people\r\nsay, \"She has no husband,\" and others, \"She is the Kaed's wife,\" to make\r\nthe best of a bad appearance.\r\n\r\n_28th._--Shut up writing during the morning, but in the evening paid a\r\nvisit to the little nasty dirty Turk, and found the little nasty dirty\r\nfellow very civil. His Excellency complained of being very sick. I\r\nreturned immediately to fetch him some medicine. Afterwards we mounted\r\ntogether to the top of the Castle. From this eminence, we had a splendid\r\nview of the environs, and the various little oases of Sockna and its\r\nneighbouring desert. The distant mountains form an unbroken circular line\r\non the pale margin of the sky, except on the east, where it is indented a\r\nlittle, but of several heights and colours, giving a fine and more varied\r\neffect to The Desert scene. Within this circle, at the base of the\r\nvarious groups, are black-green palms, scattered in little forests,\r\ncasting shades on the now white, now light red, and now purple mountain\r\nsides, as if to set off the perspective of The Desert picture. Here and\r\nthere are garden-huts or lodges in the wilderness, so many black spots\r\nwithin little squares of pale-green patches of corn cultivation. There is\r\na string of moving dots. What is that? A caravan winding along its weary\r\nway. Not a bird is seen to wing the ambient air. The atmosphere generally\r\nis a pale unpolished yellow, inclining in some cloudy flakes to red. The\r\nSaharan sun now fast descends, with a feeble heat and exhausted lustre,\r\nshowing the near approach of the dull and drowsy step of shadowy night.\r\nThere is something about Saharan views which is peculiar to them and to\r\nAfrica; every object is so smoothed down and smoothed over, that the\r\nscenery of Desert looks at a distance more like paint and picture-work,\r\nthan the stern realities of the Wasteful Sahara. And yet these\r\nsmoothed-down picture-objects are so well defined and sharply\r\nprominent--all the lines traced in the most absolute manner--no blending\r\nof shapes or even colours. Mist and misty objects are not frequent in the\r\nAfrican Desert.\r\n\r\nThe Castle of Sockna would be considered by us a ruined building, and\r\ncondemned as unsafe to be inhabited, but here it is always \"The Castle.\"\r\nIt does not contain a single good room; all is tumbling to pieces, and if\r\nyou don't take care, you will fall through some of the floors, gaping\r\nopen with large holes at your feet to let you in. Only one miserable\r\npiece of cannon was mounted, and two other pieces of ordnance were lying\r\n\"below stairs,\" corroding most delightfully in rust. But the Turks never\r\npretend that this place can make any serious defence against an enemy.\r\nWere indeed a good piece of ordnance fired from the top of The Castle,\r\nthe concussion would knock down all the part of the building where it was\r\nplaced. As it is, a portion of the outer walls has fallen down, and the\r\nrubbish is scattered up to the doors of the neighbouring shops. No effort\r\nis made to clear away this rubbish. \"Why should it not remain where God\r\nhas allowed it to fall?\" says the fate-believing Moslemite. The owners of\r\nthe shops creep to their magazines of merchandize as they best may. I\r\nremarked to the little dirty Turk, who sat with a dreamy stare looking\r\nover The Desert, smoking very unpolitely with his back to the sun, \"This\r\ncountry without question was formerly in a much better state, and The\r\nCastle in good repair.\" His Excellency shook his head negatively. The\r\nTurks detest this country, hating its inhabitants with the most cordial\r\nhatred. Yet the lust of rule, (the object of a fatal ambition in all\r\nMoslemite countries,) and the right and power of bastinading a man when\r\nthey please, reconciles them to The Desert, and to its weary, dreary,\r\nblank mode of existence. For what toys do men sacrifice the best days of\r\ntheir life, and the most noble faculties of their being!\r\n\r\nGlad to get away from the dirty old Turk. Called later to see my dearest\r\nMaraboutess, with whom I was almost inclined to fall in love. It is a\r\npositive relief to find something, and somebody amiable in this Desert of\r\nhuman affections. The saint had many visitors, and is evidently held in\r\nhigh respect by the inhabitants. Her female associates sitting by her,\r\nasked me, what has been so often asked before, if the Christian women\r\nbrought three or four children at a birth. From some cause or other,\r\npolygamy, obesity in the women, or the abuse of the marriage-bed, Saharan\r\nfemales have very few children. There were five elderly men in our\r\ncaravan; all were married, of course, for every man marries amongst\r\nMahometans. These old gentlemen had not more than two children each, and\r\none of them none. I set the Sockna ladies right, telling them, some of\r\nour women had twins, and now and then three, but that one was the rule.\r\nEvery thing about us Christians is exaggerated. The people of these towns\r\nthink us a distinct race from themselves. Such is the effect of religion\r\nwhen misapplied; it estranges men from one another instead of drawing\r\nthem together with the cords of brotherly affection. An Arab present with\r\nus, changing the subject, asked why I did not go to Bornou, for all the\r\nOulad Suleiman (Arabs of the Syrtis) up at Bornou were friends of the\r\nEnglish, and one and the same with them? He continued, \"But let them come\r\nhere to cut down again our palms, and we will not leave one of them\r\nalive.\" I gave the poor Maraboutess a few paras, received her blessing,\r\nand bade her an affectionate adieu. Happy would be many, if with such\r\nbodily afflictions they could amuse themselves with such blissful\r\nvisions!\r\n\r\nHis Excellency presented me with half a pound of coffee, and told me to\r\nbeware of the Sockna people, who would rob me of it if they could.\r\n\r\n_29th._--Called early to visit the \"Grand Turk\" of the Castle, and\r\nadministered to his Excellency a full dose of genuine Epsom. In turn, he\r\ngave me a basin of coffee with milk,--quite a novelty in The\r\nDesert,--which I thought a splendid exchange. I had a good deal to do to\r\nget him to swallow the Epsom. On calling to see him in the afternoon, I\r\nfound his Excellency racing about like a real jockey of Epsom, running\r\nout at times very abruptly, to the great amusement of his Sultana, who\r\nadmired the effects of the Epsom. Called again in the evening to see my\r\npatient, and found his Excellency suffering from what he called\r\ndysentery, and administered a couple of small opium pills. The Turk\r\nobserved, with something of a grin, that Christian doctors knew more of\r\nthe inside than the outside of a man.\r\n\r\n_30th._--Another Turk arrived this morning with another convoy of\r\nprovisions from Tripoli. He is twenty days from that city. He\r\ncomplains of the camels. Certainly I never saw worse camels than\r\nthese of the Tripoline Arabs. The Turk brings good news. Rain has\r\nfallen copiously in The Mountains. It is the \"_latter_ rain\" in the\r\nScriptural phrase, ὑετον οψιμον. The \"_early_ rain,\" ὑετον πρωϊμον,\r\nfalls in North Africa about September and October. The \"_latter_\r\nrain\" continues to April, and sometimes falls in May. In December\r\nand January there is often dry weather, and the finest season in the\r\nyear for Europeans. Want of rain in Fezzan and Sockna is compensated\r\nfor by the abundance of springs. These rains in The Mountains will\r\nestablish the rule of the Turks. It is only a question of\r\nprovisions. The want of rain for several years has brought Tripoli\r\nto the verge of ruin, and the Sultan is tired of supporting this\r\nRegency. If a few good harvests come, Tripoli will support itself.\r\nWrote to Mr. Gagliuffi by this caravan, to tell him where I was on\r\nthe 30th of March! He expects me by this time to be at Tripoli. We\r\nare to leave this evening.\r\n\r\nAmused myself again by noticing several parallel ideas between The East\r\nand Africa, as found in our Scriptures.\r\n\r\nIn these countries there is always some one great river; for this\r\nreason, Moors will always have the Nile and the Niger to be \"one\r\ngreat river.\" Mr. Cooley, in his \"Negroland of the Arabs,\" proposes,\r\nfor the various names given by ancient and modern geographers to the\r\nNiger, the simple epithet of \"The Great River.\" In The East, we\r\nhave, τὸν ποταμὸν τὸν μεγαν τὸν Εὐφράτην (Rev. xvi. 12), \"The Great\r\nRiver Euphrates.\" It is not to be supposed the prophets and\r\nevangelists were instructed in geography beyond their age. The vial\r\nof wrath is not poured upon Ganges, or Mississippi, or Amazon, but\r\non Euphrates, the great river of that age and time, although not of\r\nour age and times.\r\n\r\nΚαλαμον χρυσοῦν (Rev. xxi. 15), \"a golden reed.\" The term\r\nκαλαμον, the root of which are the three consonants κλμ,\r\nis the same as ‮قلم‬, \"a reed\" first, and afterwards, \"a\r\npen made of a reed.\" It is difficult sometimes to get reeds in The\r\nDesert, and they are carried about from oasis to oasis. On the salt\r\nplains of Emjessem, near Ghadames, there is a fine lagoon of reeds,\r\nof which pens are made. It is probable the angel _wrote_ the\r\nmeasurement of the \"Holy Jerusalem\" with a reed pen, and not\r\n_measured_ it with a reed, as represented in our version.\r\n\r\nΚαι ἡ γυνη εφυγεν εις την ερημον (Rev. xii. 6), \"and the woman fled\r\nto the Wilderness.\" The Wilderness, or Desert, in ancient times, as\r\nnow, in this part of the world, was always a place of refuge; but,\r\nas the world becomes civilized, the Wilderness will offer no\r\nresource to the fugitive, and the back-woods of the new colonies\r\nwill no longer shelter the runaway, or outlaw of society, or the\r\ninnocent patriot fleeing from the pursuit of his country's tyrants.\r\nGibbon gives an affecting description of the fugitive Roman, who\r\nfound Rome's omnipresent tyrant in every clime whither he fled, on\r\nevery soil paced by his trembling foot. Before this time arrives,\r\nlet us hope liberty will have settled down, with its outspread eagle\r\nwings sheltering every country of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\nΕὰν ὁ Κύριος θελήσῃ, καὶ ζήσωμεν, καὶ ποιήσωμεν τοῦτο ἢ εκεῖνο.\r\n(James iv. 15.) Mahomet and his disciples have made enough of this\r\ndivine injunction, which, indeed, ought to be more practised by\r\nChristians. By the Moslems, however, it is carried to a superstitious\r\nexcess, and the _En shallah_--‮ان شاء الله‬--\"_Deo\r\nVolente_,\" is continually in their mouths. They cannot even say,\r\n\"Yes,\" to anything, although _la, la_, \"no, no,\" is heard frequently\r\nenough. The _aywah_, ‮ايوه‬, \"yes,\" means rather \"well done,\" than\r\n\"yes.\" But it is a pity they have not adopted, with the same\r\nsuperstitious strictness, the ομνὑετε, \"swear not,\" of the same\r\nwriter; for no people in the world swear so much, and by such sacred\r\nnames, as the Arabs and Moors.\r\n\r\nΦόβος ὀυκ ἔστιν ἐν τῇ ἀγάπῃ, ἀλλ' ἡ τελεία ἀγάπη ἔξω βάλλει τὸν\r\nφόβον, ὅτι ὁ φόβος κόλασιν ἔχει. (1 John iv. 18.) \"There is no fear\r\nin love, but perfect love casteth out fear; because fear hath\r\ntorment.\" I have never yet heard the Arabs or Moors speak of\r\n\"_loving_ God.\" They say either, \"He _knows_ God,\" or, \"He _fears_\r\nGod.\" Nevertheless, such phrases agree with our expression of\r\nreligious sentiment. Besides knowing and fearing God, our religion\r\nrequires that we _love_ God. This the Saharan Mussulman does not\r\nwell understand. All his religious system is: \"To know that there is\r\na God, to be feared and dreaded as an earthly Prince or Sultan, who\r\nat times rules them with a rod of iron.\" So all their actions,\r\nmotives, impulses, whether religions or secular, spring the rather\r\nfrom fear than love. And so it is, that whenever they speak to a\r\nChristian about religion, their first and last argument is, \"The\r\ntorments of the Lost,\" as I have already so often mentioned; and the\r\nfear of the fire of perdition, it may be added, is their continual\r\n\"torment.\" The Koran helps them out, in their dread of corporal\r\ntorments. I need not refer to the celebrated passage, which\r\nrepresents the wicked in the regions of the lost as \"gnawing their\r\nfingers and knuckles in the rage and agonies of their pain.\" But in\r\nRev. xvi. 10, we also have--εμασσωντο τας γλωσσας αὑτων εκ του πονου\r\n\"they gnawed their tongues for pain.\" In both cases the picture is\r\ntoo terrible to be calmly contemplated. It is a true observation of\r\nphilosophy, that the pictures of the future state of man, as\r\ndelineated in the sacred books of different religions, are, the\r\ngreater part of them of a painful and horrible character. But the\r\nKoran surpasses all these books, in wire-drawn and elaborately\r\nwrought descriptions, the most mournful, the most disgusting, the\r\nmost terrible, of the torments of the damned. Is it because, men\r\ngenerally can only be moved by fear, and not by love, to the\r\npractice of virtue and religious observances? But in Sahara the\r\nprinciple of fear is carried into the minutest relations of social\r\nlife. The child fears and venerates, not loves, his father; he\r\napproaches his parent with awe, not with the confidence of love. The\r\nwife always fears, rarely loves, her husband. Connubial pleasures\r\nare not the embraces of love and confidence, but of lust and rule;\r\nand the woman slavishly submits to the caprices of the man, as bound\r\nby an absolute and resistless contract, and not from affection or\r\nany inclination. So it was in earliest times,--the weaker went to the\r\nwall, and the stronger was the master; might was right. Peter ungallantly\r\nreminds the women of his age of κύριον αὐτον καλοῦσα,\r\n\"(the wife), calling him (the husband) lord,\" as the practice of the\r\nwomen of a still remoter age. Nothing flatters an African husband so\r\nmuch as to hear his wife call him \"lord,\" and \"master.\" But it was\r\nnot the intention of the first propagators of our religion to\r\ndisturb the social customs and (Oriental habits of) society.\r\nBesides, the apostles, being Jews and Asiatics, would naturally\r\nintroduce into their new doctrine the old despotic notions of the\r\nEast regarding women. When Christianity spread west and north, these\r\nnotions of despotism over women were resisted in Greece[124] and\r\nRome, and by the Germanic tribes, amongst whom especially women were\r\ntreated as dignified and responsible agents, enjoying equal rights\r\nwith men. Nevertheless, the condition of women has improved\r\neverywhere with the spread of the pure morality of Christianity.\r\n\r\nNear Sockna, or one and a half hour east, is Houn; and two hours\r\nnorth-east, is Wadan. The water of these two towns is brackish.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] This is probably an allusion to the following observations\r\n    of Captain Lyon, in justification of his assuming the Mahometan\r\n    religion:--\"It may be necessary before I take leave of Mourzuk,\r\n    and indeed of Tripoli, to explain that our adoption of the Moorish\r\n    costume was by no means a sufficient safeguard in either of those\r\n    places, or in traversing the interior of Africa; for, though it\r\n    might, to a casual observer, blind suspicion, yet when we had\r\n    occasion to remain for a time at any place, or to perform journeys\r\n    in company with strangers, we found that it was absolutely\r\n    requisite to conform to all the duties of the Mohammedan religion,\r\n    as well as to assume their dress. To this precaution I attribute\r\n    our having met with so little hindrance in our proceedings; for\r\n    had we openly professed ourselves Christians, we might, in Fezzan,\r\n    have experienced many serious interruptions; whilst farther in the\r\n    interior, even our lives would have been in continual jeopardy.\r\n    The circumstance of our having come from a Christian country,\r\n    which we always acknowledged, frequently rendered us liable to\r\n    suspicion; but by attending constantly at the established prayers,\r\n    and occasionally acknowledging the divine mission of Mahomet; or,\r\n    more properly, by repeating, 'There is no God but God, Mahomet is\r\n    his Prophet,' we were enabled to overcome all doubts respecting\r\n    our faith.\" It must be added, in justice to Messrs. Ritchie and\r\n    Lyon, that since 1821 a vast change has been wrought in the minds\r\n    of the Moors of North Africa, and especially with regard to\r\n    Englishmen. When even Denham and Clapperton visited Mourzuk, they\r\n    were not allowed to reside in the town, but kept in the castle,\r\n    under the special protection of the Bashaw, lest anything should\r\n    befall them from the prejudices of the people.\r\n\r\n[122] As a suitable accompaniment of Mussulman charms, I add in a\r\n    note, the following specimen of a Christian charm, which I found\r\n    in the letter of the _Times'_ Swiss correspondent.--(See _Times_,\r\n    10th Dec., 1847):--\r\n\r\n    \"More--I have seen some curious little brass amulets, with the\r\n    effigy of the Virgin on one side and the Cross on the other, which\r\n    were sold in great numbers to the people as charms against all\r\n    possible injuries in battle. Those sold at seven and ten batzen\r\n    (about 10_d._ and 15_d._ of our money) were efficacious against\r\n    musket and carbine balls; those at twenty batzen (about\r\n    half-a-crown) were proof against cannon shot also! The purchasers\r\n    of these medals were also presented with a card, of which the\r\n    following is a _verbatim_ transcript, capitals, italics, and\r\n    all:--\r\n\r\n                           'O MARIE\r\n                       CONCUE SANS PECHE,\r\n            PRIEZ POUR NOUS QUI AVONS RECOURS A VOUS!\r\n\r\n    '_Quiconque_, portant une médaille miraculeuse, recite avec piété\r\n    cette invocation, se trouve placé sous la protection spéciale de\r\n    la Mère de Dieu; c'est une promesse de Marie Elle Même.'\r\n\r\n    Which, being interpreted--if indeed I may be excused for profaning\r\n    the honest English tongue with such blasphemy--is,\r\n\r\n    'Oh Mary!--conceived without sin--pray for us who have recourse to\r\n    you. _Any one_ carrying a miraculous medal, who recites with piety\r\n    the above invocation, becomes placed under the especial protection\r\n    of the Mother of God. This is a promise made by Mary herself.'\"\r\n\r\n[123] This is the tiresome, frequently-recurring phrase of the\r\n    Koran.\r\n\r\n[124] So we find Paul declaiming that he will not suffer a woman\r\n    to speak in the churches. It was the Greek women who wished to\r\n    assert the dignity of woman by teaching in the assemblies of the\r\n    saints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nFROM SOCKNA TO MISRATAH.\r\n\r\n     Well of Hammam.--Innocent game of the Negresses.--Baiting at\r\n     noon.--Bird's-nests and Birds in Sahara.--Ghiblee or the\r\n     _Simoum_; its terrible effects on our Caravan.--Delusions of\r\n     Desert, and bewilderment of our People.--Disastrous Fate of the\r\n     Young Tuscan.--Snakes.--Small capital of some\r\n     Slave-Merchants.--Arrival at Bonjem.--Visit the Roman Ruins of\r\n     Septimius Severus.--The newly created Oasis.--Regulations to\r\n     mitigate Saharan Slave-traffic.--My Imbroglio with\r\n     Essnousee.--Imbroglio of an Arab with the Kaed of\r\n     Bonjem.--Description of the Fort of Bonjem.--The Disease of the\r\n     _Filaria Medinensis_, and its Cure.--My Journal confused and\r\n     fragmentary.--Route from Bonjem to Misratah.--Enter the regions\r\n     of Rain and Open Culture.--_Bughalah_, or the Rock, where\r\n     Abd-El-Geleel was assassinated.--Wells of Daymoum and\r\n     Namwah.--Sudden changes of Temperature in North Africa.--Well of\r\n     Saneeah Abd-El-Kader.--Stream of Touwarkah.--Ecstatic joy on\r\n     arriving near the Sea.--How diminutive all things are become in\r\n     comparison with the Vast Sahara.--Arrival at Misratah.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the afternoon, about three, we left Sockna _en route_ for Tripoli; we\r\narrived at Hammam in a couple of hours. On the road, we met not less than\r\nthree hundred camels laden with provisions and ammunition for the troops\r\nat Mourzuk, shewing evidently the dread which the Turks have of the Arabs\r\nunder the son of Abd-El-Geleel, and any sudden attack by them on Fezzan.\r\nThis is a bad speculation for the Turks. Fezzan can never pay at such a\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nHammam, is a collection of small sand-hills grouped together, around and\r\nupon which are palms. There is also a well of tolerably good water. The\r\nname Hammam (\"hot-spring\"), is derived from the circumstance of there\r\nbeing here a hot-spring; but now said to be covered up by the sand-hills.\r\nThis is what the people have received by tradition. Very hot this\r\nevening; the sun burnt us most extraordinarily. We felt it more after\r\nhaving been shut up some days in Sockna; we took in a supply of water at\r\nHammam in preference to the waters of Sockna. This evening, the Negresses\r\nplayed their usual sweet innocent little game. They form an alley by\r\ntaking hands, blocked up at the end. At the top enters one of their\r\nnumber backwards. As she passes along the opposite pairs, each couple put\r\ntheir hands across and form a sort of seat for her, by which she is\r\nbumped backwards from one seat to another seat of hands, through the\r\nwhole alley. When arriving at the end, she falls into the chain of hands.\r\nAnother now enters, being bumped backwards on her broad bustle like her\r\npredecessor, and caught by the hands stretched across the alley. I don't\r\nknow whether this is intelligible, but the game is very simple and full\r\nof mirth. The point of tact is, their always sitting down on the hands,\r\nand not falling back on the ground, when, like every body who attempts to\r\nsit down on a chair and suddenly finds himself on the floor, they would\r\nlook very foolish. But as the Devil leaped over the fold of Paradise, so\r\nhe may be expected to creep in everywhere, and the Negro lads are always\r\npeeping about, at a respectful distance, to see what they can see, when\r\nthese falls take place; and I imagine the zest of the thing, both amongst\r\nthe lads and the lasses, turns upon this naughty circumstance. So much\r\nfor poor innocence, and innocent games.\r\n\r\n_31st._--Started, as the sun shewed his broad face above the horizon.\r\nRoute till the afternoon, over a sandy, gravelly plain; then entered some\r\nhilly country, where we came to the well of Temet-Tar. Excessively hot\r\nagain to-day, apparently the precursor of the Simoum the following day.\r\nIn this Fezzanee caravan, it is our practice to halt at noon, or\r\nthereabouts, to take a little refreshment. I am informed all the caravans\r\nof this route do so. The Ghadamsee caravans, on the route of Ghat, never\r\nhalt in the day-time, continuing from morning to night. Our people carry\r\na few dates in a bag, or on the camel's back, all ready for the luncheon.\r\nThese they throw down upon a portion of a barracan spread on the sands.\r\nSometimes a piece of bread is broken over the dates. They then squat\r\nround this repast in groups. The slaves save from their previous day's\r\nsupper, or from the morning, a few dates for this time of the day, and\r\nare allowed each a drink of water. Noticed a bird's nest on a furze of\r\nThe Desert. This is only the second I have ever seen in Sahara. A few\r\nsmall birds are now hopping about on the line of route. But I have\r\nobserved the colour of the birds to vary with the region through which we\r\npass. Now they are yellow, now black, now black and white, and all as\r\nsmall as linnets. These birds have no song, only chirping and twittering\r\nabout. A few larks I have seen where water and palms and other trees\r\nabound. We encamped about 4 P.M. The water of the well is by no means\r\nsweet, but not being brackish, it quenches thirst sufficiently.\r\n\r\n_1st April._--Rose early and started early. A terrible day! A\r\n_ghiblee_ in all its force[125]. The wind is directly from south\r\n(‮قبلي‬ \"south\"). It is quite dry, unlike the _sirocco_ which blows\r\nat Malta. Sirocco is damp and most enervating, and south-east in its\r\ndirection. Probably, however, it is the same wind, but sweeping over\r\nthe sea it attracts moisture, and changes to south-east. I was\r\npraying for, and prophesying all the morning, up to 9 A.M., a cool\r\nday. The reverse has happened, as so often happens in answer to our\r\nmost ardent wishes. I never was so astonished as when I saw the\r\nnegroes on this day. Mr. Gagliuffi had said to me, \"If you have\r\nghiblee, the slaves can't go.\" But I could hardly believe a hot wind\r\nto be so injurious to these children of the sun. They seemed as if\r\nthey could bear any cold better than a hot south wind. They got\r\nbehind the camels or stooped under their bellies; they held up their\r\nbarracans, taking it by turns to hold them up, by which means they\r\nsheltered five or six together; they concealed their faces and their\r\nbodies with their tattered garments; they invented all sorts of\r\nexpedients to shelter themselves a moment against The Desert simoum.\r\nI could not help observing how superior the white man was to the\r\nblack man in his physical make. Our Arabs and Moors kept up erect,\r\nfacing this furnace blast, and bore the heat and burthen of the day\r\na thousand times better than the Negroes--these children begotten by\r\nthe sun from the slime of the Niger, on whose swampy plains heat\r\nreigns eternally with all its fiery fervour! I had always thought\r\nthe Negro, being naturally a chilly creature, could not be affected\r\nwith a hot wind. We all drank plentifully today, ten times as much\r\nas on other days. But this being a ghiblee day, it was necessary to\r\ndrive on the slaves quick, and with violence, the camels not\r\ncarrying a sufficiency of water for a couple of days of this sort.\r\nEssnousee now showed how eminently qualified he was for this\r\ninfernal traffic. He did drive them on most furiously, while as to\r\none wretched Negress, I thought he would have left her dead on the\r\nspot, flaying her most unmercifully. The miscreant Essnousee was\r\nonly prevented from the perpetration of this horrid crime by the\r\nmain-force interference of Mohammed Azou, another slave-dealer\r\ntravelling with us, with seven slaves, and who, I must record, was a\r\nhumane man, though a dealer in the flesh and blood of his fellow\r\ncreatures. I have not observed him even once beating his slaves,\r\nwhich is saying a great deal. The conduct of this humane Moor proved\r\nthat it was not absolutely necessary to beat slaves when driving\r\nthem over Desert. The Touaricks of Aheer, indeed, know this, and\r\nnever lay a finger on their poor captives. We, at length, got\r\nthrough this day of horrible heat and thirst, for God gives an end\r\nto all things. Never will be effaced from the tablet of my memory\r\nthe prayer of a poor Negress girl, who, in the height of the simoum\r\ncame running up to me, her eyes bloodshot, her face streaming with\r\ntears, \"Buy me, Yâkob, O, buy me! I am very good, I will be good\r\nwife to you, and sleep with you. O, I'm dying! take me, buy me, buy\r\nme, Yâkob. The wind kills me.\"\r\n\r\nWe encamped on a vast plain, having ranges of low mountains on our right\r\nand left. The carcases of two camels were left on the road, which had\r\nbroken down from the large caravan we had passed; and, a thing unusual,\r\nthe Arabs had left part of the flesh on the bones; some of our slaves\r\nimmediately devoured it raw. Hunger's the thing to give you a relish.\r\n\r\n_2nd._--Rose at Fidger, a little before day-break, or at the point of\r\nday, in fright of another ghiblee. Necessity has, indeed, in such a case,\r\nno law, and no compassion on the unfortunate. But, to-day, God sent the\r\npoor slaves a little fresh north wind, for \"God tempers the wind to the\r\nshorn lamb.\" The north wind increased towards the evening, we journeying\r\non very well. Course, north and north-west, over the vast expanse\r\nmentioned yesterday. Quantities of bits of marble, pieces of fine quartz,\r\nand shining felspar, are strewn over the plain, which contrasting with\r\nits dark ground-work, look at times as if we were traversing some\r\nenchanted carpet. But our brains reeled, and we all suffered from thirst.\r\nPeople seemed all mad to-day. One called to me, \"Yâkob, listen.\" I\r\nlistened, but being hard of hearing, I thought there might be some\r\nsounds. Another camel-driver pretended he heard sweet melodious sounds.\r\nOn inquiring what music it was, he replied, \"Like the Turkish band.\" Then\r\nanother came running to me, \"Yâkob, see what a beautiful sight.\" I turned\r\nto look, but my eyes were so weak and strained, that I could see nothing\r\nupon the dreary face of the limitless plain. Essnousee swore to seeing a\r\nbright city of the Genii, and actually counted the number of the palaces\r\nand the palms. I believe our people were delirious from the effects of\r\nyesterday's simoum, for I did not observe mirage. The beautiful words of\r\nCowper recurred to me when I had the power of calm reflection, in the\r\nevening of the day:--\r\n\r\n    \"So in The Desert's dreary waste,\r\n    By magic power produced in haste,\r\n        (As ancient fables say,)\r\n    Castles, and groves, and music sweet,\r\n    The senses of the traveller meet,\r\n        And stop him in his way.\r\n\r\n    But while he listens with surprise,\r\n    The charm dissolves, the vision dies,\r\n        'Twas but enchanted ground.\"\r\n\r\nNot much sand on the plain, but gravel occasionally. Some sand hills\r\nappear in the distance, a line of waving dazzling white on the horizon.\r\nEncamped late in the evening. The well of Nabah is not in the line of\r\nroute.\r\n\r\nAt the site of this well happened a sad event two years and a half ago,\r\nand which now, suffering as I was with thirst, came with redoubled force\r\nto my mind. Mr. Gagliuffi, on his appointment to be Consul at Mourzuk,\r\ntook with him a young Tuscan as secretary. The vivacious Italian soon\r\nquarrelled with the Consul, and immediately determined to return to\r\nTripoli, during the height of summer (August), in spite of the warnings\r\nof everybody. However, with care and due preparation, this route, and all\r\nSaharan routes, can be and are travelled in every season of the year; as\r\nis sufficiently proved by my own journey to Ghadames. Two days after the\r\nTuscan left Sockna, came on a terrible ghiblee, but infinitely more\r\nintense and stifling than any south wind could be in this season. The\r\nTuscan was travelling with a caravan of a few people, who determined to\r\nbring up for the day, about 2 P.M., although having but a small supply of\r\nwater. They were then about seven hours from the well of Nabah. The\r\ndistance was tempting to the rash European. With a little courage and\r\ndispatch could not the well be reached before night? Why not? thought he.\r\nThe youth was self-willed and peremptory. He knew better than the old\r\nArab camel-drivers, traversing this route all their life-time. The Tuscan\r\nhad also with him a horse. But what does he do? Having about a bucket of\r\nwater left, he gives it to the horse; and then starts, taking off with\r\nhim a young Arab, apparently as foolish as himself. They proceeded on\r\ntheir last journey, the Tuscan riding the horse, the poor Arab boy going\r\non foot, as guide to the well. The caravan weathers out the ghiblee--the\r\nmen covering up their faces and mouths from the scorching blast, afraid\r\nto breathe the killing air of the simoum--the camels moaning in\r\ndeath-like tones, prophetic of the fate of those who had just gone! But\r\nnight comes, and brings some relief to the wasting, if not dying animals.\r\nThen the morning breaks with a refreshing breeze, and the exhausted\r\ncaravan has enough strength left to seek the well. Near the well, not a\r\nquarter of a mile distant, they first find the young Italian stretched\r\ndead, a little farther off the horse, and a little farther off the Arab.\r\nThey had perished at the well's mouth! There cannot be a doubt, these\r\nunhappy youths perished by their own folly. The European had even water\r\nenough to last him a whole day, but gave it to his horse, and braved\r\nwildly the death-gale of The Desert. The poor Arab, I am told, was forced\r\naway against his will to guide the mad-cap Tuscan to their fatal end. By\r\nsuch folly, have also perished unnumbered caravans in the Saharan\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nOur people who went to Nabah for water, found the well too late to\r\nreturn, and came back at day-light in the morning, about two and a half\r\nhours' distance from the line of route.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--We held on our course northward, weary and exhausted, but the\r\nwind freshened from north-west, and we did not suffer from heat. We now\r\nentered into groups of small mountains. At 4 P.M., seeing the sandy hills\r\nof Bonjem, our merciful slave-master, Essnousee, determined we might now\r\nencamp, and go fresh and early next day to the Fortress. Observed two\r\nsmall snakes to-day in open Desert, the first time I have seen them in\r\nSahara. So much for the snakes, asps, adders, basilisks, cockatrices, and\r\nfiery flying serpents of The Desert! We have with us one old gentleman\r\nwho joined us at Sockna. He is conveying _one_ slave to Tripoli. Greatly\r\nsurprised at this, I asked him how he could travel these horrid wastes\r\nwith such a miserable stake in commerce as a single slave! The Saharan\r\nveteran replied, \"You are right. It would be better for me to remain in\r\nSockna, and spend my days in prayer and poverty like a dervish. But I\r\nhave another slave in Tripoli. This is the whole of my property. I shall\r\nreturn again, after I have sold them, to Mourzuk, and buy and sell. Such\r\nis the will of God, what can I do?\" And so the traffic in human beings\r\ngoes on. It is quite certain, from this case, nothing but main force can\r\nput an end to the slave-trade, for the Moors will carry it on at all\r\nrisks, and under any circumstances. How induce men to give up a traffic,\r\nwho will travel a month over Desert with a capital of a couple of slaves!\r\n\r\n_4th._--Rose early, and was astonished and alarmed to find my bed-clothes\r\nand all my wearing apparel wet with a thick heavy dew. This I had not\r\nexperienced through all my journeyings in Desert, for, as the ancient\r\nArabian writers have styled this country, it is a \"Dry Country,\" from\r\nEgypt to the Atlantic. But new things always surprise--often alarm us. We\r\nsoon got used to dewy nights and heavy dews. We were now also entering or\r\nnear to the regions of rain. I dried my clothes at the fire, and felt no\r\nill effects from this heavy night dew. All were travelling without tents,\r\nexcept the female slaves, who, unless sheltered during the night, would\r\nsoon have died from cold. Day-time our female slaves were poorly clad,\r\nhaving on only a piece of woollen wrapper, besides a black cotton frock,\r\nand some not even a piece of wrapper to cover their heads and shoulders.\r\nBonjem people say these dews are perpetual, covering all the sandy soil\r\nof the country round with fresh green herbage, which our poor camels now\r\ncropped with a voracious delight. In two hours and a half we entered the\r\nnew town of Bonjem. It is the site of the ancient Roman station, or town,\r\ncalled Septimius Severus. A fort has recently been built from the ancient\r\nruins, with a few small miserable houses in the shape of a village. The\r\nfort, or burge, is however strong and commodious, and has quarters for\r\nthe accommodation of five hundred troops. The present garrison consists\r\nof about thirty raw Arabs, relieved every two months. They have no pay or\r\nallowance, except their rations. The object of the Pasha in the erection\r\nof this fortress, was to connect militarily The Mountains with the large\r\nand important oasis of Sockna. A few gardens have been laid out, several\r\nwells dug, and these, with the homely hovels, the very picture of \"the\r\nday of small things,\" are still infinitely preferable to the naked\r\ndesolation of Sahara. On proceeding upwards, water is here taken in for\r\nthree or four days. The water is very good, although it has a fetid\r\nodour, rendering it disagreeable when drinking. Walked about the village.\r\nThere may be forty or fifty houses, mere square boxes of mud or plaster,\r\nmixed with old Roman stones, about twelve feet high, and containing\r\nperhaps a hundred inhabitants. Being new, the houses have a clean\r\nappearance. There are two streets, and a fondouk, or caravanserai. To\r\nbuild such a village and a fortress, some rather fine Roman ruins\r\nreceived their final stroke of demolition.\r\n\r\nAfternoon,--went to see the ancient Roman station of Septimius Severus.\r\nIt lies east of Bonjem at a quarter of an hour's walking. Of the fort or\r\ncastle, there remains still a sufficient quantity of blocks of stone to\r\npoint out the four gates, and some rude pillars seven or eight feet high,\r\ndenoting the site of a temple, or other public building, within the\r\ncastle. We visited three of the gates, but found only one inscription,\r\ncut on a single block deeply imbedded in sand, and covered with other\r\nblocks of stone. The letters were Roman, and, pretty freshly chiselled,\r\nbut we could not move the other stones so as to decipher the words in\r\ntheir full length. Some blocks of stone were shaped into arches, others\r\nlay scattered in single blocks, on one of which was this plain device.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis is the sole result of my antiquarian visit. Not a bit of fine marble\r\nor a coin was picked up. The stone of the ruins was a dark grey granite,\r\nalmost black, of very coarse grain. It must have been brought some\r\ndistance, for I have seen no stone like it in the neighbourhood. The\r\nwalls of the castle were very thick, and built in the usual Roman style,\r\nwith cement and small stones, the mortar being now nearly as hard as the\r\nstone itself. These walls were also faced with the blocks of stone\r\nmentioned. The walls of the city had merely cement and small stones.\r\nThese latter are extensive. The _ensemble_ of the ruins makes one deeply\r\nregret to see The Sahara has gone back ages in the arts and civilization,\r\nfor such is evident from these _debris_ of Roman Saharan culture. This\r\nfact, even the Moors themselves accompanying me, acknowledged by such\r\nexclamations as _wasâ_, \"wide!\" and _kebir_, \"great!\" But the impression\r\nwith them is fleeting, and anything unconnected with their religion, and\r\nthe history of the conquests of Islamism, I have always observed is\r\naccounted nothing by these people. Half a day west of Bonjem, the people\r\ntell me there is a few scattered ruins of another ancient city. On our\r\nway we found two wells, lately dug, and the Taleb-Kaed says, water is\r\nevery where found near the surface, and always good, in spite of the\r\ndisagreeable gaseous exhalation when drunk. A few tiny palms are also\r\nplanted about these wells, in this Turkish attempt to upraise Septimius\r\nSeverus. The little sprigs of palm pleased all, and were welcomed by us\r\nas the germ of the future oasis, which shall afford shade and fruit to a\r\nlarge population. There may be a dozen wells already dug, and every year\r\nthe infant oasis shows more signs of life, and a little, little more\r\nprogressive existence. The prevailing soil is sandy, but good for grain\r\nand palms.\r\n\r\nThis evening had an imbroglio or row with Essnousee, who attempted to\r\nimpose upon me by charging for two or three suppers which he furnished me\r\nin the way of hospitality at his native place of Sockna. I had lent him\r\nall my money to purchase food for his slaves. He now refused to refund,\r\non this and other pleas.\r\n\r\nDuring the road from Sockna to Bonjem, I thought of two or three\r\nregulations which might mitigate the evils of Saharan slave-traffic, as\r\nwell as limit its operations, if our Government could prevail upon the\r\nTurks to adopt them. If we can't stop the trade at once, we may try to\r\nlessen its miseries. We English did the same in the case of our own\r\nslave-trade.\r\n\r\n1st. That no Tripoline, or other Ottoman subject, should purchase a slave\r\nout of the provinces of Tripoli.\r\n\r\n2nd. That the slaves _en route_ for Tripoli should be accompanied by a\r\nGovernment officer, who should watch over them and see that they are not\r\nover-driven or inhumanly flogged.\r\n\r\n3rd. That for every slave dying _en route_, or in any of the towns _en\r\nroute_, for the markets of the Coast, whatever may be the cause, the\r\nowner of that slave should be fined a sum equal to the duty paid for it\r\nto Government.\r\n\r\nThe first rules would lessen the operations of the traffic, and prevent\r\nslave-merchants from purchasing and speculating in Soudan, and always put\r\nthem under the eye and surveillance of the agents of Government. The\r\nsecond would in a great measure prevent over-driving and inhuman\r\nflogging, if faithfully followed out. The third would, at least, always\r\ninsure the slaves having food enough to preserve them in good health.\r\n\r\nI think I see the free-trader smile at these restrictions, and hear him\r\nsay, \"What humbug!\" But first, it is here a question to regulate a\r\nnefarious traffic which the Porte, our ally, is not yet prepared to\r\nabolish. Until the free-trader can prove to me that the traffic in slaves\r\nis a legitimate commerce, I shall advocate the crippling of it by\r\nrestrictions, let these restrictive regulations be ever so puerile. But\r\nwe have the fact, that since Mr. Gagliuffi persuaded the Ottoman\r\nauthorities to lay a tax of ten dollars per head on each slave, the\r\ntraffic has diminished considerably. So at any rate the merchants\r\nthemselves tell me. This was the object of the Vice-Consul, and he\r\naccomplished his object. On the other hand, it could be represented to\r\nthe Porte, that the first regulation would bring the commerce of the\r\ninterior within their territories, a great advantage for the Regency of\r\nTripoli.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Not so much dew as yesterday morning. The imbroglio with\r\nEssnousee continues about refunding the money I lent him. To-day it\r\nassumed a formidable shape, not only all our caravan was involved in it,\r\nbut the whole of the town, and the Kaëd at their head. I agreed to give\r\nthe slave-merchant a fair price for his suppers, but for the rest,\r\ninsisted on being paid back the money which I lent him, and which he\r\npromised to refund at Sockna. On arriving at Sockna, Essnousee found\r\nmoney scarce, and thought he would bamboozle me out of my money. The\r\nTaleb-Kaëd saw the justice of the plea, as did all the people, and the\r\nmerchant was ordered to give me the balance of the few dollars. The money\r\nwas requisite to purchase a little milk, or butter, or fresh provisions.\r\nMy vanity, however, came in the way of my stomach. So when I got the\r\ndollars, to show I did not carry on this imbroglio for selfish purposes,\r\nbut solely for the sake of common justice between man and man, I ordered,\r\nwith great pomposity and an air of immense benevolence, the money to be\r\ndistributed to the poor of the town. This ostentation greatly pleased all\r\nthe Moors and Arabs, save and except the crest-fallen chagrined\r\nEssnousee; it only increased the bitter misery of his defeat. I was\r\nwicked enough to be glad to humiliate the unfeeling slave-dealer in this\r\nway, for he had no money and was obliged to borrow to pay, which sadly\r\nlessened his consequence.\r\n\r\nAfterwards went to see the Moorish Secretary Kaëd, installed in the\r\nCastle. This functionary is placed here principally for the dispatch of\r\nthe mails backwards and forwards. The secretary does not interfere with\r\nthe Sheikh who commands the garrison, and only attends to couriers and\r\nthe little affairs of the village. For this work he has the large salary\r\nof three dollars per month. It seemed as if imbrogliamento was the order\r\nof the day, for here I witnessed a row as violent as my own. An old Arab,\r\nvery crusty and obstinate, had arrived from Sockna on Government\r\nbusiness. He was to receive money from the Kaed, and pay money to him.\r\nThe Kaed would not pay, and he would not pay. The old gentleman sat down\r\nbefore the irritated functionary, and holding the teskera and a new\r\nTurkish passport in his hand, said, \"Give me my rights. Why rob you a\r\npoor man? Is it because I am poor and old you rob me? Fear I the Sultan?\r\nWhy should I fear you or the Sultan? I fear alone God.\" The excited Kaed\r\ncould no longer restrain himself. He seized the papers out of the hands\r\nof the Arab and tore them to pieces, exclaiming, \"Go out, you dog!\"\r\nBesides this the Kaed threatened the bastinado. The hangers-on of his\r\nExcellency carried the old man out of the apartment until the wrath of\r\ntheir dwarf tyrant had cooled down. The affair afterwards ended by both\r\nparties accepting and paying their mutual claims. The Arabs are greatly\r\nexasperated about these passports, which, indeed, are of no possible use,\r\nand are only used by these petty functionaries to extort money from the\r\npoor people. An Arab said to me, showing the animus of the question\r\nhereabouts, \"Before our Sultan became a Christian we never heard of these\r\nteskeras. Now that he is become an infidel, he sends us these accursed\r\nthings to take away our money, and rob our children of bread.\" The poor\r\nSultan, in fact, if he can get hold of any detestable thing of European\r\ncivilization, is sure to adopt it, to torment his subjects.\r\n\r\nSpent the rest of the day within the Castle, gossiping with the Arab\r\nsoldiers, their Sheikh, and the Kaed. To-day I was thankful for two\r\nthings, for having inflicted a salutary lesson on the iniquitous\r\nslave-driver, and for being sheltered from the sun and wind. The Castle\r\nhas three towers at three of its corners, but not rising much higher than\r\nthe upper terrace walls. The outer walls are about twelve or fifteen feet\r\nhigh, and as usual pierced with holes for musketry. I did not see any\r\nmounted ordnance. Within is a fine court yard, and there is a detached\r\nbreast-work of defence over the entrance. It is very comfortable in many\r\nof its apartments, affording a most effectual shelter from wind and heat.\r\nThe short time of service makes the Arab soldiers cheerful, and they are\r\npretty well fed and enjoy good health. There is no fever, but they tell\r\nme there are a few cases of the _Enghiddee_ of Soudan, a fine silken worm\r\nformed under the cuticle of the body, mostly on the legs and arms,\r\nalready described under the name of Arak-El-Abeed[126]. Arabs do not\r\ncatch this disorder so much as merchants going to Soudan. The only arms\r\nthese troops have, is the matchlock or musket, on some of which the\r\nbayonet is mounted. From the top of the Castle the surrounding country\r\npresents an unbroken mass of desert, and more distantly low ridges of\r\nmountains and sand hills. The Kaed assures me, however, that in seven\r\nyears he will have a fine plantation of palms. He has planted several,\r\nand is about to fetch some choice shoots from Tripoli. With toil and care\r\nThe Desert, in truth, can not only be rendered habitable and tractable,\r\nbut even comfortable, as the building of this fort well proves. It has\r\nbeen built since Mr. Gagliuffi passed this way to Mourzuk, and I am the\r\nonly European who has seen this bran-new town of Bonjem. The Bashaw of\r\nTripoli boasts of it as his work, and on my return begged me to give him\r\na sketch of it, which I did, but for which I received no thanks. A few\r\nsnakes are often seen coiling themselves on the shrubs, gazelles,\r\naoudads, and wild oxen, skip and bound and run about, now and then an\r\nostrich races past or sails along, half in heaven and half on earth, and\r\ndeebs (wolves) come down to drink at the pits during the night. But the\r\nArabs are not allowed to hunt, nor garden or dig; their duty is to spend\r\nthe live-long day in \"strenuous idleness,\" or doing nothing but sleep and\r\nlounge. To-day was hot and sultry. The female slaves were very busy in\r\nwashing themselves. They afterwards had a good race stark naked, running\r\nafter me and grinning. It is very seldom they commit such breaches of\r\nmodesty. In general, the Negress is very modest in her manners, more so\r\nthan Mooresses.\r\n\r\nI congratulated myself in having a comfortable sleep under roof to-night.\r\nI felt glad also for a rest here of a couple of days. In travelling\r\nthrough Sahara, one or two days greatly relieve you without making you\r\nfeel that you have been stopping when you again mount the camel, whilst a\r\nrest of a week often makes a new journey and a new tour, and you feel all\r\nthe pain and misery of beginning again.\r\n\r\n_6th to the 11th._--My journal gets very fragmentary, confused, and\r\nenigmatical. Many of the memorandums I cannot recal to mind. I find I was\r\ngetting at this time much exhausted, and weary of writing. My health,\r\nindeed, was being greatly undermined, and suffering was become my daily\r\nsolace! Often I could not stand when lifted off my camel. Sometimes I was\r\nsenseless for an hour or two after we had encamped. I expected \"to get\r\nused to it.\" Vain thought! I was just as tired and stiff with riding the\r\nlast day as the first day when I started on the tour, besides having my\r\nhealth and strength essentially impaired.\r\n\r\nWe directed our course to Misratah, instead of Benioleed, on account\r\nof there being more water in the former route. Benioleed, or Ben\r\nWaleed--‮بن وليد‬--lies to the north-west of Bonjem, but Misratah\r\nnearly due north. I was disappointed in not seeing Benioleed, on\r\naccount of its Hesperian valley of olives, and other fruit-trees\r\nscattered in paradisal beauty and profusion. The valley, in which\r\nthe town is situate, lies at the base of some of the lofty ridges of\r\nthe Tripoline Atlas, and contains a population of about three\r\nthousand souls. I was glad to hear there were some Europeans now\r\nemployed in improving the wells of the town, sent by the Bashaw, all\r\nwhich denotes progress in the Turk. Benioleed is six good days'\r\njourney from Bonjem, and four or five from Tripoli.\r\n\r\nNothing remarkable occurred in our route from Bonjem to Misratah. Before\r\narriving at Bonjem, I saw, by the nature of the country, that we were\r\napproaching the regions of rain, herbage and shrubs increasing on every\r\nside. The country also assumed a more even, though an undulating\r\nsurface; and I lost sight of those low, dull, dreary, and monotonous\r\nridges which characterize the desolations, of the African Wilderness.\r\nHowever, I expected to see the eastern terminations of the Tripoline\r\nAtlas. Continuing our six days' route, now west, now north-west, now\r\nnorth, and now north-east and east, wriggling in serpentine style about,\r\nwe arrived at length within open-culture lands, where were two or three\r\nsmall patches of barley, mostly in ear, not being irrigated, but left to\r\nthe free rains of heaven. The sight of these made my heart bound with\r\njoy: now I knew I had got without the bounds of the dry and desolate\r\nSahara! There seemed to be something so fresh and natural about\r\nbarley-fields, depending for life and growth on the fattening rains of\r\nheaven, in comparison with the garden patches of grain I had witnessed\r\nfor months cultivated by the hand of man. All our people seemed equally\r\naffected by the sight of these natural corn-fields; and Essnousee, to\r\nshow his respect for property thus left to the mercy of every\r\ncamel-driver, ordered the camels not to be driven through the standing\r\nbarley. The camels heeded little the command, and managed to get large\r\nmouthfuls; our Soudan sheep fed to their full; a good deal was also\r\ndestroyed. I observed, nevertheless, the camels preferred the green\r\ntender herbage, to the corn in the ear, and picked it out carefully\r\nbetween the rows of straggling barley. With the increase of herbage and\r\nwater,--for water was not found in all the route from Bonjem,--the\r\nanimals increased. Gazelles bounded before us, at times in small herds of\r\nsix or seven; and hares were constantly started from under the camels'\r\nfeet. We had no sportsmen with us, and no game was shot or taken. The\r\nArabs ran frequently to the bushes whence the gazelles bounded, in order\r\nto find young ones. Birds now increased to full flights. Here were\r\nnumbers of little birds with yellow body and brown back. This part of The\r\nSahara had its particular bird, as the rest. The little black and white\r\nfellow higher up was now succeeded by the little yellow and brown fellow.\r\nOther birds were flying about, but not so numerous as this species. But\r\nthe bird that now caught my attention was the gull. At first I was\r\nperplexed to know how this bird could be found so far up The Desert, but\r\nI recollected we had but six or seven days from Bonjem to Misratah, near\r\nthe coast. The gull suggested to my drooping spirits sea-breezes to\r\nrestore my shattered frame, and gave me new life. As we neared Misratah\r\nthe country increased in comeliness (because after so much desert), and\r\nnear Misratah the hills were actually green and flowery, so long black\r\nand hideously bare. But indeed, it was the best time of Spring. We passed\r\non every side scattered Arab tents,--to us pavilions of pleasure,--with\r\ntheir flocks and herds: all denoting open-culture and the presence of\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nScarce a ten-thousandth part of this country is reduced to cultivation.\r\nHere and there only are some few corn-fields, where the seed, when sown,\r\nis left to get ripe as it may, the only manure being the burning of the\r\nstubble of the previous year. We must, indeed, say more or less of the\r\ncoast of all North Africa, and express the same hope for the future in\r\nthe words of one of the prophets: \"And the desolate land shall be tilled,\r\nwhereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by. And they\r\nshall say, This land that was desolate is become like the garden of\r\nEden; and the waste, and desolate, and ruined cities are become fenced,\r\nand are inhabited.\" (Ezek. xxxvi. 34, 35.) North Africa was once the\r\ngarden as well as the granary of the world. A series of disastrous\r\nrevolutions has successively reduced this once so fair and fertile\r\nregion, to waste, barrenness, and barbarism; the Mahometan fate-doctrine\r\nmeanwhile hugging and conserving its ruins and dilapidations. We may\r\nperhaps hope, the French are doing something for the Algerian coast. The\r\nTurks may yet do something in Tripoli. Tunis and Morocco have more\r\ncultivated lands than Tripoli or Algeria, and reforms are agitating both\r\ncountries. Once the spirit of improvement gets fairly into this region,\r\nit may resume its ancient celebrity of being \"like the garden of Eden.\"\r\nNear Misratah, I observed, for the first time in my tour, the\r\nhawthorn-tree: it was reddened over with nice ripe haws.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the _6th_, we passed the spot where Abd-El-Geleel was\r\ndecapitated, called Bughalah (\"mule\"). This was a small piece of\r\nmountain, looking abruptly over a wady, or deep valley. On this mountain\r\nblock the Sheikh concentrated all his military forces, collecting as well\r\nthe families of his tribe. Here he skirmished with the Turks for many\r\ndays, he winning and they winning a battle, as it happened; but they, at\r\nlength hemming him round, and isolating him on the rock, where there was\r\nnot a drop of water to be had, the Sheikh finally was obliged to\r\nsurrender. His retiring to this hideous rock was only matched in folly by\r\nhis confiding in the faith of a Turk. Truly, when men are to be\r\ndestroyed, their evil genius inspires them with madness.\r\n\r\nOn the _8th_, we took in water from the well of Daymoum. Around were the\r\nremains of a fortified camp, and stones were placed in a large circle.\r\nThis camp was erected by Hasan Bashaw, Commander-in-Chief of the Regency,\r\nwhen he was at war with Abd-El-Geleel. It looks not unlike a Druidical\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nOn the _9th_ we took in a little water from the well of Namwah. Several\r\nsea-gulls were here flying about. To-day I have to mention a fact which\r\nshows to what extraordinary changes of temperature the Great Desert is\r\nsubject, as well as Barbary generally. About nine in the morning a strong\r\nghiblee got up, increasing till it became so violent that we encamped at\r\nonce, not venturing to expose the slaves to this killing simoum. Covering\r\nup my face and mouth, I put my head into a pannier. I was almost\r\nsuffocated it is true, still it was better than exposing myself to the\r\nsearching flame of this furnace wind. What became of the slaves I cannot\r\ntell, I was too busy with myself. Here I lay gasping for an hour, when Said\r\ncame and called to me, \"Now _Bahree_ (‮بحري‬),\" or north. \"How,\r\nbahree!\" I answered astonished. \"Bahree! bahree!\" he continued, \"the\r\ncaravan is going.\" I got up, and felt sensibly and convincingly enough it\r\nwas bahree. The wind had made a whirlwind sweep in the space of an hour,\r\nit was now blowing as hard from the north as it had done from the south.\r\nBut strange yet natural enough, columns of hot air were blown back into\r\nour faces from the north for some time, until, towards the evening, the\r\nwind became as cold, bleak, and biting, as it had been hot and stifling.\r\nThese sudden changes are terrific, and are often attended with most\r\nserious consequences in The Desert. Asking our people how long a simoum\r\nor ghiblee would blow in The Desert, they replied, \"Never violently more\r\nthan a couple of days.\" I do not recollect it once to have continued a\r\nwhole day, but light south winds have prevailed for several days. As an\r\ninstance of the calamitous effects of sudden changes of weather in North\r\nAfrica, I may mention that, in the Spring of 1845, when Sidi Mohammed,\r\n\"Bey of the Camp\" in the Regency of Tunis, was returning from the Jereed,\r\nhe lost, on one day, some Turks and other troops from the heat, and, on\r\nthe very next day, several perished from the cold. Some hundred camels\r\nalso died from the cold at the same time. A recent expedition in Algeria,\r\nduring which some hundred French troops were frozen to death, must recur\r\nto the recollection of the reader, having happened from the same cause of\r\na sudden change of temperature.\r\n\r\nOn the _10th_ we came to the well of Saneeah Abdel Kader, (\"Garden of the\r\nslave of the Most Mighty,\" or God). At this place was a ruined fortress,\r\nlooking over an immense district of country, a great quantity of which\r\nwas under cultivation, presenting light-green and orange-brown patches of\r\ngrain. We passed the stream of Touwarkah, a name apparently derived from\r\nTouwarick, or Touarick. The bubbling running stream was looked upon as a\r\nwonder by our slaves. They rushed into it, and washed and bathed\r\nthemselves, like so many mad things; indeed, after so much dry desert,\r\nthe stream was a wonder to us all. I had almost begun to think I should\r\nnever see again a large running stream. But I have seen the negresses\r\nwash their faces, hands and legs, on the coldest morning. An Arab or a\r\nMoor hardly washes himself once a month. These habits of cleanliness the\r\nnegresses bring from the banks of the Niger. We had the village of\r\nTouwarkah on our right, to which was attached a forest of palms, nearly\r\nhalf a day's journey in length. I had scarcely spoken a word to Essnousee\r\nduring these last five days, but, on the morning of the 11th, he entered\r\nvoluntarily into conversation with me, informing me there was an English\r\nquarantine agent at the port of Misratah. The slave-driver, getting\r\nnearer to the coast, had cunningly abated his ardour for beating the\r\nslaves. He now began to fear he might get reported to the Bashaw.\r\nSometimes, however, he would throw a stone at the poor things, that is,\r\nwhen too idle to go and flog them. I looked about in vain for the Atlas\r\nchain, or the last of its eastern links; one mass of undulating country\r\nstretched to the sea-shore. What feeling of excessive joy thrilled\r\nthrough my nervous frame when our people talked of the sea, for though\r\nnot visible to us, we were near enough to breathe its invigorating air.\r\nNow, indeed, all was changed, and new life took possession of the entire\r\ncaravan. The green and pleasant spring cultivation, the darkly fair\r\nverdure of several young olive-trees, here and there a graceful palm, now\r\nbroad leafy shadowy fig-trees, the delicate almond and the pretty\r\npomegranate, all the treasures of the gardens of Misratah, raised our joy\r\nto ecstasy. I myself often thought I should never see again Tripoli, or\r\nthe sea; now they seemed restored to me, and I to them, as if at one time\r\nthey had been hopelessly lost! But how small had all objects become, how\r\ndiminutive, how confined, limited and contracted their dimensions, and\r\nhow pretty yet how petty, compared to the vast huge and limitless lines\r\nof existence, which form and circumscribe the Great Saharan Regions!\r\nwhere I had travelled so many long months. When I first arrived in\r\nAfrica, I looked upon the dark and purple mountains of the coast with a\r\nspecies of mysterious feeling, as if such mountain groups were boundless\r\nin extent, unfathomable and unsearchable in their stronghold foundations.\r\nBut now, returning again to the regions of Atlas, the chains of this\r\ncelebrated range in Tripoli, Tunis, and Algeria, seemed like old familiar\r\nfaces to me, or so many contracted domestic objects. My eye had been so\r\naccustomed to gazing day after day over plains without an apparent bound,\r\non mountain ridges running along weeks and weeks of Desert journeying,\r\nthat it could now only regard all the African coast scenery as so many\r\npretty little painted landscapes, which might be reduced and easily\r\naccommodated to stage scenery at a minor theatre.\r\n\r\nOn the arrival of our ghafalah at Misratah, I was introduced to the\r\nquarantine agent, Signor Francesco Regini, an Italian born in Tripoli,\r\nbut under British protection, and having a Maltese wife. Regini begged me\r\nto put up in his house, and I accepted his kindly proffered invitation,\r\nwhen his wife cooked me a fowl and I dined like a prince. I now thought I\r\nwould return to Tripoli by sea, to get a little bracing sea-air, but\r\nafterwards I determined to continue with the caravan of slaves to\r\nTripoli, to see the last of the poor things, or accompany them till their\r\narrival at the Tripoline market of human flesh.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[125] As the description of the _Simoum_ (\"poisoned\" wind, from\r\n    ‮سمّ‬ \"poison\"), given by the following writers, is the account\r\n    of men, who were _bonâ fide_ Saharan travellers, I shall take the\r\n    liberty of transcribing their various relations:--\r\n\r\n    \"Nothing can be more overpowering than the South wind (Ghibee,) or\r\n    the East, (Shirghee), each of which is equally to be dreaded. In\r\n    addition to the excessive heat and dryness of these winds, they\r\n    are impregnated with sand, and the air is darkened by it, the sky\r\n    appears of a dusky yellow, and the sun is barely perceptible. The\r\n    eyes become red, swelled and inflamed; the lips and skin parched\r\n    and chapped; while severe pain in the chest is generally felt, in\r\n    consequence of the quantities of sand unavoidably inhaled.\r\n    Nothing, indeed, is able to resist the unwholesome effects of this\r\n    wind. On opening our boxes, we found the many little articles, and\r\n    some of our instruments which had been carefully packed, were\r\n    entirely split and destroyed. Gales of the kind here described,\r\n    generally continue ten or twelve hours.\"--LYON.\r\n\r\n    \"I derived some benefit from fastening a strip of cotton over my\r\n    eyes, and another over my mouth, to keep off the burning air which\r\n    parched my lungs. The burning East wind which was beginning to\r\n    blow rendered the heat insufferable, and the scorching sand found\r\n    its way into our eyes, in spite of the precautions which we took\r\n    to exclude it. Tepid water was distributed, which we thought\r\n    delicious, though it had little effect in quenching our thirst. My\r\n    thirst was so tormenting that I found it impossible to get any\r\n    sleep. My throat was on fire, and my tongue clove to the roof of\r\n    my mouth. I lay as if expiring on the sand, waiting with the\r\n    greatest impatience for the moment when we were to have our next\r\n    supply of water. I thought of nothing but water--rivers, streams,\r\n    rivulets, were the only ideas which presented themselves to my\r\n    mind during this burning fever. In my impatience I cursed my\r\n    companions, the country, the camels, and for anything I knew, the\r\n    sun himself, who did not make sufficient speed to reach the\r\n    horizon.\"--CAILLIE.\r\n\r\n    \"The Simoum felt like the blast of a furnace. To describe this\r\n    awful scourge of The Desert, defies all the powers of language.\r\n    The pencil assisted by the pen might perhaps afford a faint idea\r\n    of it, winged with the whirlwind and charioted with thunder, it\r\n    urged its fiery course, blasting all nature with its death-fraught\r\n    breath. It was accompanied by a line of vivid light, that looked\r\n    like a train of fire, whose murky smoke filled the whole wide\r\n    expanse, and made its horrors only the more vivid. The eye of man,\r\n    and the voice of beast were both raised to heaven, and both then\r\n    fell upon the earth. Against this sand tempest all the fortitude\r\n    of man fails, and all his efforts are vain. To Providence alone\r\n    must we look. It passed us, burying one of my camels. As soon as\r\n    we rose from the earth, with uplifted hands for its preservation,\r\n    we awoke to fresh horrors. Its parching tongue had lapped the\r\n    water from our water-skins, and having escaped the fiery hour, we\r\n    had to fear the still more awful death of thirst.\"--DAVIDSON.\r\n\r\n[126] This disease is the _Filaria Medinensis_, or Guinea Worm.\r\n    The rude Arabs give a sort of Shakesperian witches' receipt for\r\n    the cure of this disease, such as the liver of a vulture, the\r\n    brains of an hyæna, the dung of the ostrich, mixed with other\r\n    wonderful ingredients. This reminds me of the receipt of my\r\n    Ghadamsee Doctor for the cure of _Night Blindness_, which here\r\n    followeth:--\"_Description of a remedy by which affliction (or\r\n    blindness) of the sight is cured at night_.

It is a grand _festa_ with Signor Regini, and his\r\nfamily are dressed out in their best. They are the only family of\r\nChristians in this town, but keep the _festa_ with as much religious zest\r\nand zeal as if in Malta or Rome. Poor Regini gets only twelve dollars a\r\nmonth from the Pasha of Tripoli for his employment of quarantine agent,\r\nand is obliged to look after three ports, for Misratah has three ports,\r\nat a considerable distance from each other, as well as several hours'\r\nride from the town. Visited with Regini the acting Kaed or Governor of\r\nthis place, and brother of the Bey, now in Tripoli. The Kaed stared\r\nstupidly at me whilst relating to him some things about the Touaricks.\r\nHe was astonished they treated me so well, instead of murdering me, as he\r\nthought they had a right, or ought to have done. This Moorish beast\r\nfinished by consulting me respecting his health, and begging physic, but\r\nwhich I refused to give him, seeing his indisposition proceeded from\r\nsheer indolence. His people, or officers of the place, were all amazed at\r\nmy travelling as I was, and wondered what I could be doing. Mr. Regini\r\nheard one say, \"The Christian has written the country; the English are\r\ncoming to take all this land.\" Another observed, \"This Englishman is a\r\ndervish, and is mad. His friends send him here to get rid of him.\" I took\r\nno interest whatever in the interview, feeling thoroughly tired of my\r\ntour and the people. The Kaed had heard some merchants say, \"The\r\nTouaricks are a people of one word,\" which he now repeated, and which was\r\na good satire upon himself and his Moorish brethren, \"A people of ten\r\nthousand words.\" The Kaed informed me of the safe arrival of Haj Ibrahim,\r\nand the rest of his party, at Tripoli.\r\n\r\nRegini's house is a constant resort of visitors and idlers. Amongst the\r\nobjects of attraction, is Mr. R.'s pretty little daughter, who turns the\r\nheads of all the Moors. Mr. R. says the Pacha is going to build him a\r\nlarger house, and allow it him rent-free, as an increase of salary. This\r\nHis Highness, indeed, promised to do. But Mehemet Pasha showed the usual\r\nand insulting duplicity of the Turk, for the Consul-General heard\r\nafterwards that, instead of giving Regini a new house, he increased the\r\nrent of his old one. This unhandsome conduct of the Pasha so enraged\r\nColonel Warrington, that, on hearing it, after he had invited the Bashaw\r\nto dine with him at his garden, the Colonel determined to withdraw the\r\ninvitation, or rather not give the dinner. So the Pasha's dining at the\r\nBritish garden did not come off, much to my annoyance, for I wished to\r\nhave been present at the dinner. These little bits of Turkish duplicity\r\nirritate and annoy our Consuls more than acts of tyrants like Asker Ali.\r\n\r\nVisited the environs in the evening. Picked up some chamomile flowers,\r\nwhich abound in the lanes and highways. The barilla plant is also very\r\ncommon; it is collected and burnt, and the ashes exported in considerable\r\nquantities. Several ponds of water are found during winter in this\r\nneighbourhood, which are frequented by numerous flights of wild-duck,\r\naffording capital game for the hungry sportsman. Date-palms are now in\r\nblossom, whose flowers are all at first encased in a pod. Essnousee tells\r\nme, Abd-El-Geleel destroyed the palms of Sockna by simply cutting off the\r\ntops or heads of the palms, in the same way as people do when they tap\r\npalms for leghma. Some of them grow again, others do not, it being all a\r\nmatter of chance. The date-palm is most abundantly cultivated on the\r\nTripoline Coast, supplying the people with a full third of their food.\r\n\r\n_13th._--Misratah is an aggregate or series of villages, scattered about\r\nto an extent of a full day's journey, containing about 12,000\r\ninhabitants, two-thirds Moors, the rest Arabs, Negroes, and Jews. The\r\nhouses and other buildings make but a mean appearance, built of mud and\r\nstones, and some of lime-mortar. There are a few Marabets shining\r\nbeautifully white in the sun, with light and chaste cupola tops. A\r\ndrawing of one of these is given, that of Sidi Salah. The Marabet is a\r\ncommon, but fair and picturesque, feature in coast scenery. The bazaar,\r\nor market of Misratah, is held three times a week, but in different\r\nplaces of the villages included within this circle of jurisdiction. The\r\nprincipal port is three or four hours from the central village, the\r\ninhabitants not enjoying an immediate view of the sea, so delightful on\r\nthe North African Coast. The grand cultivation is dates, but not of good\r\nquality, then barley and wheat (the most of the former), olives, figs,\r\nand some other fruit-trees. Oxen, goats, and sheep, are in numbers, and\r\nthere is a considerable export trade in hides and wool. The markets are\r\npretty well stocked with provisions, and cheaper than in Tripoli.\r\nNevertheless, the villages of Misratah are choked full of very poor\r\ndestitute people, and during the past year, in the midst of comparative\r\nabundance, many of them lived almost entirely on herbs. These wretched\r\ncreatures congregate in Misratah from all the neighbouring districts, the\r\nGharian and Gibel mountains, the village of Touarghah, and other places.\r\nThe same system of spoliation by Government is going on here as in other\r\nprovinces of Tripoli, the inhabitants being reduced gradually to most\r\ncomplete beggary. Every year the number of poor increases, whilst the\r\ntaxes on land, under the curse of Turkish oppression, as fatally\r\nincrease, reducing all to serfdom, leaving not an acre of land in the\r\nhands of the people, excepting those lands protected by the sanctuaries\r\nof religion. The civil power in this country has no conscience; the\r\npeople are alone protected from annihilation by their religion.\r\n\r\nFifty families of Jews are located in these villages, occupied as\r\nbrokers and petty traders, or in making essences. They pay a\r\npoll-tax of a hundred mahboubs per annum to the Pasha. They have two\r\nsynagogues, and a Rabbi superintending them. Rabbi Samuel says he\r\nhas heard there are Jews in Soudan. Lyon has mentioned the same\r\nreport, and locates Jews south from Timbuctoo, supposing them to\r\nhave gone originally from Morocco. Many of the Tripoline mountains\r\ncontain Jews, and in Misratah there are a hundred families. As a\r\nspecimen of the state of Biblical learning and literature amongst\r\nthese Jews, I give the following conversation I had with Rabbi\r\nSamuel. He explained the 53rd chap. of Isaiah as referring to\r\nanother and a past suffering Messiah, the Messiah of Ephraim, the\r\nson of Ephraim, and not the son of David, who is to be the future\r\nand conquering Messiah. To Philip's question, \"Of whom speaketh the\r\nprophet this?\" &c. (Acts viii. 34), he candidly answered,\r\nacknowledging that the prophet spake not of himself, but the suffering\r\nMessiah. The epithets אל גבור‬ and ‮אבי־עד‬, in Is.\r\nix. 6, 7, the Rabbi explained, as denoting the reign of Messiah to be full\r\nof peace and happiness for all mankind, quoting Psalm lxxii.,\r\nobserving properly, the words first refer to Solomon, and then to\r\nthe Messiah. Asking him for a passage of the Pentateuch, referring\r\nto the future state, he replied;--\"Moses did not speak at all of a\r\nfuture state; Moses intended to have done so when he got to\r\nJerusalem, and settled the people in the Holy Land; but having\r\noffended God, he was not permitted to enter there, and was prevented\r\nfrom communicating knowledge about the future world. But you will\r\nfind in the commentaries all the information you require.\" He could\r\nnot tell where the future state was spoken of in the prophets, so I\r\npointed out to him Daniel xii. 2, 3. Rabbi Samuel now bestowed on me\r\nthe honorary title of English Marabout, earnestly recommending me to\r\ncall on Rabbi Jacob at Tripoli, the mighty scholar of the Regency.\r\nHe added:--\"The Mussulmans say that our Messiah will conquer them\r\nfirst; but afterwards, they (the Mussulmans) will recover their\r\nstrength and dominion, and destroy us and our Messiah. You see they\r\nare idiots.\" So much for Jewish learning in Tripoli.\r\n\r\nSignor Regini is an original in his way. Speaking of an old man about\r\ntaking a young wife, he observed, \"Growing old, he became young.\" Of\r\nhimself, he says, \"_Noi siamo molto respetati qui_ (We are much respected\r\nhere).\"\r\n\r\n\"So you ought to be,\" I replied, \"for I would not live here to be\r\ndespised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Signore Inglese,\" he rejoined abruptly, \"I am the first man here.\r\nYou are a learned man, and have travelled all over the world, and you\r\nknow Latin; '_Aut Cæsar, aut nullus_,' that's my motto. I only want the\r\nflag here. Get me appointed British Consul. I don't want a salary. Then\r\nshall I be a greater man than the Bey of Misratah.\"\r\n\r\nI promised, as in duty bound, after this sally of modest ambition, to\r\nmention his wish to the Consul-General. The fact is, Regini is a very\r\ndeserving man, and could he hoist the Union Jack, might benefit British\r\nsubjects and promote British interests at the same time that he gratified\r\nhis own Cæsar-like ambition.\r\n\r\nThis afternoon we left Misratah for Tripoli, our last stage. We found the\r\ngardens of Misratah very agreeable, getting clear of them by night, and\r\nencamping in a hilly country, covered with the delicious green of spring,\r\nwith nibbling snowy flocks scattered and feeding, and Arabs' tents\r\npitched, \"black, but comely.\" But I was surprised to see so few Arabs'\r\ntents and douwars in this Regency. In fact, the Arabs of Tripoli are\r\nnearly all located and confined to The Mountains.\r\n\r\n_14th._--Afternoon, arrived at _Zeitin_, a small village. The palm is\r\nabundant as usual, and the gardens are full of olive and\r\nother Barbary fruit-trees. On encamping, I purchased some\r\n_Leghma_--‮لقمة‬--according to some philologists, \"tears\" of the\r\npalms, and others \"foam,\" from the fermenting quality of the sap. At\r\nthis season many trees are tapped, being, indeed, the tapping season.\r\nWhen a tree is tapped, a small hut of palm-branches, cut from off the\r\ntapped palm, is set up close to it, which is turned into a sort of\r\n_tap_-room, or boozing-place, for drinking the leghma, and half a\r\ndozen Moorish louting fellows are always seen idling and skulking\r\nabout the hut, or sweltering with intoxication inside, as long as the\r\ntree yields the spirituous juice. A tree, if a good one, will yield\r\nits sap for two months, and sometimes a few days more. You can\r\npurchase a tree, tap it and drink of its sap at your pleasure, for\r\nonly a couple of dollars. And for this trifle, people will often\r\ndestroy their best palms. The leghma is pleasant when quite new or\r\nfresh; when a few days old it becomes very strong and acrid drinking,\r\ncontinually fermenting. Moors do not understand drinking leghma, wine\r\nor spirits, for their health, considering the object of drinking\r\nfermented liquor is not attained until they become intoxicated. In\r\nthese palm-booths, or huts, the Moors occasionally bring their\r\nprovisions, and here they will pass night and day for weeks together\r\nin dreamy drunken musings, each sot, shut up in himself, making\r\nhimself by a drunken and delirious imagination, Kady, or Sheikh, or\r\nSultan, or some mighty warrior, and all mankind his slaves and ardent\r\nworshippers, as the bent of mind wildly leads him. Moderation Moors\r\ncannot comprehend, they can neither drink moderately, nor eat\r\nmoderately; they must either abstain altogether or eat or drink like\r\nbeasts. Of course I speak of their general character. But such is the\r\ncase with too many amongst us, as well as these semi-barbarians.\r\n\r\nWe encamped amidst palms and barley-fields. High wind from the east. The\r\nbarley was getting ripe very fast, in some places being reaped. All these\r\ncrops of grain are thin, the stalk of the barley short, the ears\r\nsmall--not the barley or wheat of England certainly. No part of North\r\nAfrica furnishes such fine and heavy corn-fields as my own native county,\r\nLincolnshire; I might, perhaps, add, no place in the world. The plains of\r\nMorocco furnish thousands of acres of barley[127], but all straggling and\r\nthinly growing. The wheat is the same. Add to which, you will find a\r\nNorth African corn-field full of weeds, herbs, and wild flowers.\r\n\r\n_15th._--Helping up my little Negro to a ride this morning, as the camel\r\nascended a hillock he was pitched off in a summerset. A slave immediately\r\ngot hold of him and began to stretch his neck for fear it was broken, and\r\notherwise pull and manipulate him, holding him up by the head and neck.\r\nManipulation and pulling and stretching are favourite appliances of\r\nremedy in all this part of Africa. Manipulation is frequently used at the\r\nbaths, and is attended with surprising cures. Every muscle of the body is\r\nstretched, and rubbed, and _coaxed_. To burning, bleeding, and charms,\r\nsome Moorish doctors add manipulation, as the fourth sovereign remedy.\r\nEarly, we reached Sahel (Salhin?). These cultivated lands are a\r\ncontinuation of Zeiten; but Sahel is in a much higher state of\r\ncultivation. The golden harvest is nodding over Afric's sunny plains.\r\nFields of ripe barley are waving in the wind, overshadowed with splendid\r\npalms of young and vigorous growth. Besides there are most beautiful\r\nolive plantations all around us. Essnousee, who now became a little more\r\nfamiliar, kept crying out to me with spontaneous admiration, \"This is the\r\nnew world (_Dunyah Jedeed_)!\" The slave-driver had heard me praise the\r\nvast fields of fertility in America. Sahel, in fact, is a country of most\r\nvigorous and teeming fertility. But, to-day, from the camel's back, I saw\r\nthe sea. How rejoiced I was, after nine months _Ocean_ Desert-travelling,\r\nover sands and rocks, and naked sultry plains, suffering all sorts of\r\nprivations and hardships, to see once more the world of waters! And this,\r\nnotwithstanding it had been so often unfriendly to me in my various\r\ntravellings by land and water. I kept straining (and pumping) my lungs to\r\nbreathe its pure cool air. Sahel is of considerable extent, but has no\r\nnucleus of houses in the shape of a town, consisting merely of a series\r\nof small villages and detached houses, like our cottage groups and farms,\r\nbut, of course, in Moorish style. Extremely warm to-day, though near the\r\nsea. Cleared the Sahel the afternoon, and, at night, encamped amidst the\r\nlast groups of the Atlas, spreading and stretching eastwards. I had\r\nobserved we were about to enter these terminus groups and links of the\r\neastern Atlas chain, whilst at some distance, and easily distinguished\r\nthem from those of the Saharan groups and ridges. Their appearance is\r\nstrikingly different, being wooded and bristling on the sides, shooting\r\nup in craggy heights, hoary and white on the uppermost peaks and ridges,\r\nas if bitten by the cold and frost, and bared by the bleak winds of the\r\nsea. The Great Desert ranges, on the contrary, are naked as nakedness can\r\nbe, dull, dreary, and dead, smoothed over as velvet, of black and purple\r\nhues, and look more like mountains which children might paint than the\r\nsterile realities of Old Sahara. Here, amidst the mountainous scenery of\r\nthe coast, I could recognise many of the features of Virgil's\r\ndescription. (Æneidos b. iv.)\r\n\r\n    \"Jamque volans apicem et latera ardua cernit\r\n    Atlantis duri, cœlum qui vertice fulcit:\r\n    Atlantis, cinctum assidue cui nubibus atris\r\n    Piniferum caput et vento pulsatur et imbri;\r\n    Nix humeros infusa tegit; tum flumina mento\r\n    Præcipitant senis, et glacie riget horrida barba.\"\r\n\r\nBut this grand portrait of Old Atlas, whose brawny shoulders support our\r\nvarious globe, can only be realized (during winter) in the Morocco chain\r\nof the Atlas, whose highest peak is Miltsin, in Jibel Thelge, or\r\n\"Mountain of Snow.\" This peak, some 15,000 feet in height, is near the\r\ncity of Morocco itself. Dr. Shaw, who never visited Morocco, was puzzled\r\nto apply this classic description to the Algerian chains of Atlas. The\r\nAtlas Chain, which here terminates eastward, strikes out into the ocean\r\njust below Santa Cruz, in Morocco, being its western termination; but, in\r\nTunis, at many places, it is interrupted in its connecting links. I was\r\ndelighted to find a number of beautiful fruit-gardens, so many Hesperian\r\nspots, in the small valleys of these Atlas groups, observing for the\r\nfirst time the vine cultivated in vineyards. Several pleasant fields of\r\nthe vine adorned the valleys. But the date-palm disappears in these\r\nmountains, whilst the olive increases, crowning the lower groups of\r\nAtlas, or spreading in large fields in the valleys. Patches of wheat and\r\nbarley are also cultivated on the mountain sides. Arab stone-built\r\nvillages are seen scattered through the rising groups and valleys. I am\r\ntold these gardens belong to people in Tripoli. They are the sweetest,\r\nprettiest, loveliest little things which I have seen in all my nine\r\nmonths' tour. Oh, that these valleys were full of them!\r\n\r\nAt noon, we passed the ruins of Lebida (or Lebdah) on our right, situate\r\non the sea-shore, several miles out of the line of route. What nonsense\r\nto believe Cicerones in these parts. Regini told me I should be sure to\r\nsee Lebida, for it was in the road--that is to say, five or six miles\r\noff, behind sand-hills. The whole of the ground, from Sahel to these\r\nfirst groups of Eastern Atlas, is scattered over with Roman and Greek\r\nruins, and, as it happens, there is a huge piece of an ancient building\r\nin the road itself, apparently a temple. I was too weak, however, to\r\ndescend from the camel, to look closely at it. Many of these\r\nmountain-ridges are crowned with ancient forts, and farther on, when we\r\narrived close by the sea-shore, we observed the remains of a Roman\r\nroad,--a firm broad layer of cement and small stones embedded in the\r\nshifting sands. This was making a road in a business-like, dominion-like\r\nstyle, and worthy of those once mighty masters of the world. In our\r\ntraverse of the mountains we met the Bey of Misratah returning from\r\nTripoli, full of the confidence of his Turkish master the Pasha, and very\r\nsplendidly attired though _en route_, with some dozen mounted Moors, all\r\nvery gay, showing themselves off on their prancing barbs. Essnousee, with\r\nall our people, descended from their camels to pay their respects to\r\nthese big-wigs, and made them a present of some crushed Sockna dates,\r\ncalled Krum. Here new cavalry horses were feeding, attended by the\r\nNitham, or new troops. The Turks in Tripoli have but one small troop of\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThe old Moor with one slave, and I frequently had some serious talk\r\ntogether, but I could seldom draw him out. I spoke to him about Said\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"I don't know what to do with Said. If I take him to my\r\ncountry, the cold will hurt him, and perhaps he'll die.\"\r\n\r\n_Old Moor._--\"Rubbee (God)!\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"I thought of giving him my camel, and letting him turn\r\ncamel-driver; but the Arabs are such thieves, they will soon steal the\r\ncamel from him.\"\r\n\r\n_Old Moor._--\"Rubbee (God)!\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"He's such a goose, too, he gives away all he has.\"\r\n\r\n_Old Moor._--\"Rubbee (God)!\"\r\n\r\n_Myself._--\"Perhaps I shall leave Said at Tripoli.\"\r\n\r\n_Old Moor._--\"If it please God.\"\r\n\r\n_16th._--All the morning we continued to traverse the Atlas groups. I\r\nfound the lesser summits of these groups also strikingly contrasted with\r\nthe Saharan ridges. Here were heights crowned with fresh and green\r\ncultivation. On the contrary, the Saharan mountain tops are covered with\r\nlava and columnar green stone, and overstrewn with other loose stones,\r\nforming an extensive black and dreary plain. At noon, we got upon\r\nundulating ground, a great part of which was under cultivation, with here\r\nand there sheep and cattle grazing. Encamped in the Wady Seid (Zag). This\r\nundulating ground is sometimes called the fertile plain of El-Jumr. Wady\r\nSeid is now quite dry, but evidently has a strong and large current\r\nduring the winter rains. In the course of this day's march, crossed many\r\nsmall but deep dry ravines, all of which have water in the winter. No\r\nhares or gazelles were started in these few days' journey from Misratah,\r\nthe country being generally populated, but birds increased on every side.\r\nNoticed here, as in Tunis, a great variety of beetles. North Africa,\r\nindeed, is the classic land of beetles; also a few snakes and many\r\nlizards were observed. Our people now all shaved their heads and washed,\r\nchanging their linen in preparation for our entering Tripoli to-morrow or\r\nnext day. A Moor will wear a shirt three months, an Arab, six months or a\r\nyear. They cannot comprehend the necessity of the frequent changes of\r\nlinen by Europeans. And yet, Moors will take a bath once or twice a day,\r\nwhilst they re-put on their linen for three months together.\r\n\r\n_17th._--When we started this morning we fully expected to reach Tripoli\r\nin the evening, at least I did, leaving the ghafalah at Tajourah. But,\r\nafter we had marched a few hours, the sky was suddenly overcast, and the\r\nwind blew until it became a horrible tempest--\r\n\r\n    \"Sudden the impetuous hurricanes descend,\r\n    Wheel through the air, in circling eddies play,\r\n    Tear up the sands, and sweep whole plains away.\"\r\n\r\nWe got safely over Wady Rumel, whose bed is covered with reeds, having\r\nbesides a good deal of stagnant water. My nagah forded the river as well\r\nas any of the camels, if not better. We now entered the sands of the\r\nsea-shore, and after two hours sat down to eat a few dates. We resumed\r\nour march through the sands which line the margin of the sea, the wind\r\nmeanwhile blowing a perfect gale.\r\n\r\nNow I witnessed what I had not seen in my nine months' Saharan travel, a\r\nveritable sandstorm. The wind so filled the air with sand, that we could\r\nhardly see, or get on groping our way, and we were obliged to hold on our\r\ncamels, for fear of being blown off. Our poor slaves shrunk back aghast\r\nfrom the tempest, whilst the sea now and then broke open upon them\r\nthrough the sand groups, showing, to their amazement, its most\r\ntempestuous aspect.\r\n\r\nAssuredly this, their first sight of the sea, will be associated in\r\nmemory hereafter with the greatest and most cruel sufferings of our poor\r\nslaves, for to-day they suffered unusually from the wind and cold--the\r\ntempest of sand blinding them, and the miserable creatures falling\r\ncontinually on the wayside. I secured my eyes and face from the sand by\r\ntying round them a dark silk handkerchief, through which I saw my way\r\nwithout getting eyes, ears, and mouth full of sand. All our animals, as\r\nwell as our people, had a thick coating of sand round their eyes, the\r\ncold and wind making their eyes run, and the water collecting the sand.\r\nUnable to proceed farther, we were obliged to encamp about 2 P.M., close\r\nby the sea-shore, under the shadow of a great cliff, the spray of the\r\nwaves washing our feet and resting-place, and the noise of their chafing\r\nand roaring stunning our ears, whilst the sand-storm worked its way of\r\ndesolation over our heads. The slaves surprised by this new sight of the\r\nsea, lashed into its wildest form, stared with wonder and horror at the\r\ntempest-tossed waters; some grinned and chattered with their teeth;\r\nothers looked savage and moody, as if asking, \"Whether the devils of the\r\nwhite men inhabited these waters?\" whilst others, cowered down and\r\nsinking, hid their faces under their tattered clothes. I love to look\r\nupon the sea in its wildest shape, possessed by the tempest, and am\r\ndisposed to be very poetical about it, but, mind you, rather from the\r\nland, than pitching over its briny foamy billows. We had some rain, and\r\nthe cold was intense during the night. In very deed, it seemed as if\r\nheaven and earth were conspiring against the wretched, slaves the nearer\r\nthey approached the end of their sufferings! Still there was an end of\r\nthis, as of all things, and God sent us fair weather the next day. I was\r\ngrievously afflicted about Said this night. He had suddenly disappeared\r\nduring the sandstorm, and what had become of him I could not tell. I kept\r\nasking myself, \"Whether he was doomed to perish at the gates of Tripoli,\r\non his return, after his painfully wearying journey?\" I sent out people\r\non all sides. No tidings were brought of him. All was a blank...... We\r\ncalled, and called...... No answer.\r\n\r\n_18th._--Started early, but without Said. I began to be overwhelmed with\r\nsadness at his unaccountable disappearance. My impression was, when more\r\ncalm, that he had overslept himself during the day, whilst we rested an\r\nhour to eat a few dates on the sand, and the slaves walking with him, or\r\nhis companions, allowed him to sleep on without waking him. I missed him\r\nimmediately, but was told he was a short way behind and would soon be up\r\nto us. As he was in the habit of loitering behind in this way, I saw no\r\nreason for not believing what the slaves said. However, I lectured the\r\nslaves and all the people, knowing he could not have been left behind\r\nwithout some trick, or connivance on their part, threatening to bring\r\nthem up before the Pasha. This startled them, and they were all uneasy.\r\nBefore, they seemed to care no more about it than if a dog had been left\r\nbehind. But at noon, Said was brought up by an Arab who had found him on\r\nthe roadside, lost and wandering about. He pretended he had been sick and\r\nstayed behind voluntarily, afraid to accuse the slaves to me of their\r\nunkindness in leaving him sleeping on the sands. Said knew very well we\r\nhad fed them and clothed them often _en route_, and the sick had often\r\nbeen placed on my camel, whilst I walked wearily over Desert. I really\r\nfelt deeply wounded at this ingratitude of the slaves, but I believe it\r\nwas a trick planned by Essnousee, to give us annoyance. Poor Said had\r\nslept all night in open Desert, amidst sand and wind, and cold and rain,\r\nwith nothing to eat. His lips were blanched and his eyes streamed with\r\nwater. I got him placed on a camel.\r\n\r\nThe wind continues to blow high, and the storm still lingers late,\r\nscattering about sand. Several of the female slaves are placed on the\r\ncamels from utter exhaustion. Others are cruelly driven on. Just as we\r\narrive at Tajourah, a negress of tender age falls down from exhaustion,\r\nbleeding copiously from the mouth. The Arabs on foot cannot get her\r\nalong. Essnousee, seeing this, called out, \"Beat her, beat her.\" But the\r\npeople not obeying his brutal orders, he immediately jumped off the\r\ncamel, taking with him a thick stick to beat her. As soon as he did this,\r\nnot being able to restrain myself, I instantly also jumped off my camel,\r\nand ran after him, taking with me a stick, a match for his. When I got up\r\nto him, surrounded with a group of people, some of whom were from the\r\nneighbouring village, all striving to save the girl from his stick, I\r\ncalled out, \"Now, stop, stop your stick, we are now in Tripoli; no more\r\nwhipping on the road,\" holding up my stick and assuming a threatening\r\nattitude, determined to resist the slave-driver at all risks. Seeing\r\nthis, he cowered back at once, and screamed out, \"Oh, it's a she-devil!\"\r\nThe people now took courage against the monster, and said, \"No, no, she's\r\nexhausted with fatigue (with the way).\" Essnousee then had her carried on\r\nthe back of a camel to the village, and afterwards she continued riding\r\nto Tripoli. I was just in the humour for giving this miscreant\r\nslave-driver a thrashing, and taking on him satisfaction (but a millionth\r\npart indeed), for the torments he had, during forty days inflicted upon\r\nthese wretched slaves, and should have done so had he attempted to beat\r\nthe poor exhausted bleeding negress. I felt myself secure enough at the\r\nentrance of the gardens of Tripoli, and could well stand the risk of\r\nbeing brought up before the Pasha for flagellating an honourable\r\nman-dealer.\r\n\r\nWe sat down under some olives a minute, ate a few dates, drank a little\r\nwater, and then entered the gardens of Tajourah, which offered nothing\r\nnew, except that they were more richly cultivated than most of those we\r\nhad seen on our way. Threading our way amidst the mud garden walls, I was\r\ngratefully soothed with the sight of increasing culture, and population.\r\nA sweet trait of the tender passion must be here recorded as taking place\r\namidst this havoc of human cruelty, perpetrated on our sable brothers and\r\nsisters. At the side of my camel were two young things, a lad and a girl,\r\nwho every now and then, when the Moors turned their heads, watching their\r\nopportunity, kept locking one another's fingers together. The lad now\r\nstarted off as if shot from a bow, and instantly brought some beans from\r\na neighbouring garden, and these he presented gracefully to his\r\nlady-love. With such a little innocent incident, and there were many of\r\nthe kind, I bid an eternal farewell to this slave caravan, by stating\r\nsuccinctly the results of my observations on the traffic in slaves, as\r\ncarried on in The Great Desert of Sahara.\r\n\r\n_1st._--The slave-traffic is on the increase in The Great Desert; (though\r\ntemporarily decreasing on the route of Bornou).\r\n\r\n_2nd._--Many slaves are flogged to death _en route_ from Ghat to\r\nTripoli, and others are over-driven or starved to death.\r\n\r\n_3rd._--The female slaves are subjected to the most obscene insults and\r\ntorments by the Arab and Moorish slave-drivers; whilst the youngest\r\nfemales (children of four or five years of age) are violated by their\r\nbrutal masters, the Tibboos, in coming from Bornou to Ghat, or Fezzan.\r\n\r\n_4th._--Slave children, of five years of age, walk more than one hundred\r\nand thirty days over The Great Desert, and other districts of Africa,\r\nbefore they can reach the slave-markets of Tripoli to be sold.\r\n\r\n_5th._--Three-fourths of the slave-traffic of The Great Desert and\r\nCentral Africa, are supported by the money and goods of European\r\nmerchants, resident in Tunis, Tripoli, Algiers, and Egypt.\r\n\r\n_6th._--A considerable traffic in slaves is carried on in the Southern\r\nProvinces of Algeria, under French protection, by the Soufah and Shânbah\r\nArabs.\r\n\r\n_7th._--At present there are no wars carried on in Central Africa, except\r\nthose for the capture of slaves, to supply the markets of Tripoli and\r\nConstantinople; (so far as my information goes).\r\n\r\n_8th._--Slaves are the grand staple commerce of the Soudan and Bornou\r\ncaravans, and without slaves this commerce could hardly exist. Twenty\r\nyears ago, the Sheikh of Bornou reiterated to our countrymen; \"You say\r\nthat we are all the sons of one father; you say also, that the sons of\r\nAdam should not sell one another; and you know every thing. God has given\r\nyou great talents. What are we to do? The Arabs who come here will have\r\nnothing else but slaves. Why do you not send us merchants?\"\r\n\r\nThe gardens of Tajourah are about one and a half hours' ride. There was\r\nthen the break of an hour, where are pools of stagnant salt-water, with\r\nsnipes running about. Afterwards we entered the gardens of the Masheeah,\r\namongst which is the British garden, or residence of Colonel Warrington.\r\nThe Masheeah is a series of mud-walled gardens, or small fields of corn,\r\nfruit, and vegetable cultivation, and houses within the enclosures. Some\r\nof them not unlike town farms. The whole stretches some ten miles along\r\nthe sea-shore. The population of the Masheeah, including Tajourah, is\r\nequal to that of the city of Tripoli itself, if not greater. These\r\nsuburban villages have their mosques and religious establishments. They\r\nhave besides a separate Governor from that of the town, and their\r\ninhabitants exercise great political influence during a revolution. In\r\nthe last, these people supported one Bashaw, or pretender against the\r\nother, or that of the city. The Masheeah is two-thirds of a mile from the\r\ngates of Tripoli. The houses and gardens being situate mostly on the east\r\nand southeastern suburbs of the city.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in the neighbourhood of the British Consul's garden an hour\r\nbefore sunset. On the road, near it, are great gaping holes, very\r\nconvenient for tumbling in on a dark night. These holes were dug years\r\nago to store grain in. The Tripoline Government thinks it not worth while\r\nto fill them up. Immense fig-trees have grown up in some of these holes.\r\nI deemed it prudent to wait near the Consular Gardens till dark, having\r\nrather a dervish appearance, and being without an European hat, cap, or\r\nshoes. Whilst waiting in a neighbouring garden, a Moor came up to me and\r\ntalked, and then brought me a little cuscasou. I felt sensibly this\r\ntrifling manifestation of hospitality on my return.\r\n\r\nIt is now just eight months and a half since I left Tripoli for Ghadames.\r\nI have passed eighty days, or nine hundred and sixty hours, out of this\r\non the camel's back, and made a tour in The Sahara of some one thousand\r\nsix hundred miles. I reckon my distances and days thus, averaging one\r\nwith another:--\r\n\r\nDAYS' JOURNEY.\r\n\r\nFrom Tripoli to Ghadames     15 days\r\nFrom Ghadames to Ghat        20  \"\r\nFrom Ghat to Mourzuk         15  \"\r\nFrom Mourzuk to Tripoli      30  \"\r\n                             --\r\n        Total                80  \"\r\n\r\nThese eighty, days, at the rate of twenty miles per day, make 1600 miles.\r\nI walked every day, one day with another, about two hours, which, at the\r\nrate of two and a half miles per hour, makes the distance of four hundred\r\nmiles that I went on foot through the Great Desert.\r\n\r\nI wore out two or three pairs of shoes, but not one suit of clothes. My\r\nMoorish articles of dress I gave to Said, except the burnouse, which I\r\ngave away afterwards in Algeria. My whole expenses, including servant,\r\ncamel, provisions, lodging, Moorish clothes, &c., &c., for the nine\r\nmonths' tour, did not exceed fifty pounds' sterling, and nearly half of\r\nthis was given away in presents to the people and the various chieftains,\r\nwho figure in the journal. I am sure, for I did not keep an exact\r\naccount, my expenses did not exceed the round number of fifty by more\r\nthan half a dozen pounds. I hope, therefore, I shall not be blamed for\r\nwant of economy in Saharan travelling, especially when it is seen that\r\nthe Messrs. Lyon and Ritchie expedition cost Government three thousand\r\n(3000) pounds' sterling, whose journey did not extend further south than\r\nmine, nor did they, indeed, penetrate so completely into The Sahara as I\r\nhave done. Capt. Lyon likewise writes, that without \"additional pecuniary\r\nsupplies,\" he could not think of proceeding farther into the Interior,\r\nand accordingly returned. But were a person to ask me these questions,\r\n\"Did you spend enough? Did you supply all your necessary wants? Could you\r\nsafely recommend others to follow your example?\" I must reply negatively\r\nto them all. This tour, to have been performed properly, as undertaken\r\nonly by a private individual, ought to have cost at least one hundred\r\npounds. The reader will, perhaps, be inquisitive to know, at whose\r\nexpense the journey was accomplished. On this score, I am also disposed\r\nto be as communicative as on other points, for I do not wish this or that\r\npatronage to be suspected, although certainly the spending of fifty or\r\nsixty pounds' sterling is not a very mighty business. Well, then, the\r\nexpenses were paid out of the funds of a salary granted for\r\ncorrespondence by one of the London newspapers. So much for the aid\r\nsupplied by the Fourth Estate for the prosecution of philanthropic\r\nobjects and discoveries in Africa. Let our printers' devils have their\r\ndue in these days of universal patronage and pretension.\r\n\r\nI now lay down and stretched myself at full length upon the fresh herbage\r\nunder a sheltering palm, watching with a silent melancholy the last\r\ndeparting rays of the sun. I then thought over all my journey, beginning\r\nwith the beginning and ending with the end, all the incidents of the\r\nroute from first to last, and all the privations and sufferings I had\r\nundergone--praying to and thanking the Almighty for having delivered me\r\nfrom every ill and every danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.--Said, on my leaving Tripoli, was committed to the care of\r\nSignor Merlato, the Austrian Consul, who promised to find him employment,\r\nor keep him in his own service. My poor camel, for which, were I a poet,\r\nI would chant a plaintive strain of adieu! I was obliged to sell. The\r\nBengazi Arab who bought her promised me, however, to treat her lightly,\r\nand only to use her to ride upon.\r\n\r\n    \"The world and I fortuitously met,\r\n    I owed a trifle, and have paid the debt.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[127] On the plains of Angadda the French troops, at the battle of\r\n    Isly, passed two or three days together through fields of barley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\nLONDON: HARRISON AND CO., PRINTERS, 45, ST.
