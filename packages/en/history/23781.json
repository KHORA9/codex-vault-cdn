Four\r\nyears more, and the world would reach the half-century mark. That seemed\r\nvery ancient to the little girl in Old New York. They talked about it at\r\nthe breakfast-table.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose any one could live to see nineteen hundred?\" asked the\r\nlittle girl, with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\nFather Underhill laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Count up and see how old you would be, Hanny,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I should be--sixty-five.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not as old as either grandmother,\" said John.\r\n\r\n\"If the world doesn't come to an end,\" suggested Hanny, cautiously. She\r\nremembered the fright she had when she was afraid it would come to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't half developed,\" interposed Benny Frank. \"And we haven't half\r\ndiscovered it. What do we know about the heart of Africa or the\r\ninterior of China--\"\r\n\r\n\"The great Chinese wall will shut us out of that,\" interrupted the\r\nlittle girl. \"But it can't go all around China, for the missionaries get\r\nin, and some Chinese get out, like the two little girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is some outside to China,\" laughed Benny Frank. \"And India is a\r\nwonderful country. There is all of Siberia, too, and British America,\r\nand, beyond the Rocky Mountains, a great country belonging to us that we\r\nknow very little about. I believe the world is going to stand long\r\nenough for us to learn all about it. Some day I hope to go around a good\r\nbit and see for myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some people,\" began Mrs. Underhill, \"reason that, as it was two\r\nthousand years from the Creation to the Deluge, and two thousand years\r\nmore to the birth of Christ, that the next two thousand will see the end\r\nof the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are beginning to think the world more than four or five thousand\r\nyears old,\" said Benny Frank. He had quite a taste for science.\r\n\r\n\"It'll last my time out, I guess,\" and there was a shrewd twinkle in\r\nFather Underhill's eye. \"And I think there'll be a big piece left for\r\nHanny.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl of eleven mused over it. She had a great many things to\r\nthink about, and her mother suggested presently that there were some\r\nthings to do. Margaret went upstairs to straighten the parlor and\r\narrange a table in the end of the back room for callers. Hanny found\r\nplenty of work, but her small brain kept in a curious confusion, as if\r\nit was running back and forth from the past to the future. Events were\r\nhappening so rapidly. And the whole world seemed changed since her\r\nbrother Stephen's little boy had been born on Christmas morning.\r\n\r\nIt was curious, too, to grow older, and to understand books and lessons\r\nso much better, to feel interested in daily events. There was a new\r\nrevolution in Mexico; there was a talk of war. But everything went on\r\nhappily at home. New York was stretching out like a big boy, showing\r\nrents and patches in his attire, but up-town he was getting into a new\r\nsuit, and people exclaimed about the extravagance.\r\n\r\nAs for Stephen's baby, there wasn't any word in Webster's Dictionary to\r\ndo him justice. He grew fat and fair, his nose became shapely, his\r\ndimple was deeper, his chin double, and his pretty hands began to grasp\r\nat everything. Stephen said the only drawback was that his hair would be\r\nred. Hanny felt curiously teased about it. She couldn't be sure that it\r\nwas quite a subject for prayer; but she took great comfort in two lines\r\nof the old hymn--\r\n\r\n    \"Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,\r\n    Uttered or unexpressed,\"\r\n\r\nand she hoped God would listen to the sincere desire of her heart.\r\n\r\nEarly in February the children were all excitement about Mr. Bradbury's\r\nconcert. The Dean children were among the chorus singers, and Charles\r\nReed had a prominent part. Would his mother let him go?--the children\r\nall wondered.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Reed can manage it,\" said Josie Dean, confidently. \"Wives have to\r\nmind their husbands about boys, because the men know best, and the boys\r\nare to grow up into men.\"\r\n\r\nHanny's interest was divided by Margaret being made ready for the\r\nValentine ball. Everybody was to go in a fancy dress. Dr. Hoffman chose\r\nMargaret's, which was to be a lady of 1790. Miss Cynthia came and looked\r\nover the old green-and-white brocade that had descended from Miss Lois.\r\nIt had a low square neck, and a bodice with deep points back and front,\r\nlaced with a silver cord. The front breadth, \"petticoat,\" as it was\r\ncalled, was white satin, creamy now with age, embroidered with pink and\r\nyellow roses and mossy green leaves. The brocade fell away in a long\r\ntrain, and at the joining was a cascade of fine old lace called Mechlin.\r\nThe elbow-sleeves were edged with it, and at the neck, the lace had a\r\nfine wire run through it at the back that made it stand up, while in\r\nfront, it fell to a pretty point, and was clasped with a brooch. It had\r\nbeen made for Miss Lois' wedding outfit when she was a happy young girl,\r\ndreaming over a joyous future that had never come to pass.\r\n\r\nBut Margaret's hair they all thought the crowning glory. Miss Cynthia\r\nwas very fond of adorning people for parties, and so deft that she was\r\nin frequent demand. She had brought a great high comb of beautiful,\r\nclear shell that had belonged to her mother. There was a loose twist\r\nmade like the figure eight at the back, and in front, rows of dainty\r\npuffs and ends of curls, that dropped down on her white forehead.\r\n\r\nThe brooch, too, was curious. It was a portrait painted on ivory of the\r\nMarquis de Lafayette, and set round with beautiful pearls, one of Miss\r\nCynthia's precious belongings also.\r\n\r\nWhen Margaret looked at herself in her mother's tall glass, she was so\r\nmystified that she felt for a moment as if she was Miss Lois come back.\r\nFor when the gown fitted her, she must have been tall and slim and\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nHanny had begged to ask in all the girls, and was delighted to have\r\nDaisy Jasper and her mother.\r\n\r\nBut when Dr. Hoffman came in Continental costume, with buff\r\nsmall-clothes and black velvet coat, great buckles of brilliants at his\r\nknees and lace ruffles at his wrists and shirt front, and his hair\r\npowdered, they all exclaimed. He carried his three-cornered hat under\r\nhis arm as he bowed to the ladies.\r\n\r\nJohn Underhill declared laughingly that he felt honoured by being the\r\nfootman to such a grand couple, as he helped them into the carriage.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't people dress as beautifully now?\" said Daisy Jasper, with a\r\nsigh. \"Everything looks so plain.\"\r\n\r\nThen the elders began to talk of past fashions. Miss Cynthia said her\r\nmother's wedding gown was made with a full straight skirt six yards\r\naround, and had one little hoop at the hips to hold it out. When Miss\r\nCynthia's elder sisters were grown, she cut it up and made them each a\r\nfrock, with skirts two and a quarter yards wide, short full waists, and\r\npuffed sleeves. Big poke bonnets were worn with great bunches of flowers\r\ninside, and an immense bow at the top, where the strings were really\r\ntied. If you wanted to be very coquettish, you had the bow rather on one\r\nside. The skirts barely reached the ankles, and black satin slippers\r\nwere to be worn on fine occasions; white or sometimes pale colours to\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n\"And now we have come back to wide full skirts,\" said Miss Cynthia.\r\n\"We're putting stiffening in to hold them out. And there's talk of\r\nhoops.\"\r\n\r\nAnother odd custom was coming into vogue. It was considered much more\r\ngenteel to say \"dress.\" Frock had a sort of common country sound,\r\nbecause the farmers wore tow frocks at their work. The little girl had\r\nbeen laughed at for saying it, and she was trying very hard to always\r\ncall the garment a \"dress.\" Gown was considered rather reprehensible, as\r\nit savoured of old ladies' bed-gowns. Now we have gone back to frocks\r\nand gowns.\r\n\r\n\"The Continental fashions were extremely picturesque,\" said Mrs. Jasper.\r\n\"And the men were strong and earnest, and equal to the emergencies of\r\nthe day, if they did indulge in adornments considered rather feminine\r\nnow. But I like the variety. The newly-arrived emigrants in their\r\nnative garb interest me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some around in Houston Street,\" laughed Ben. \"Dutch girls\r\nwith flaxen hair and little caps, and those queer waists with shoulder\r\nstraps, and thick woollen stockings. Some of them wear wooden shoes. And\r\nIrish women with great plaid cloaks and little shawls tied over their\r\nheads, short skirts and nailed shoes that clatter on the sidewalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see them,\" said Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"Joe ought to take you out on St. Patrick's day,\" returned Ben. \"But\r\nthey soon reach the dead level of uniformity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fancy an Indian in coat and trousers instead of blanket, war-paint, and\r\nfeathers,\" and Jim laughed at the idea.\r\n\r\n\"I think we shall hardly be able to reduce him to modern costumes. He\r\ndoes not take kindly to civilisation.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's shamefully treated anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jim, it won't do to take your noble red men from romance. The\r\nheroes of King Philip's time have vanished.\"\r\n\r\nJim was reading Cooper, and had large faith in the children of the\r\nforest. The next generation of school-boys called them \"sneaking red\r\ndogs,\" and planned to go out on the plains and shoot them.\r\n\r\n\"If we absorb all these people, we shall be a curiously conglomerate\r\nnation by and by,\" exclaimed Mrs. Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"As we were in the beginning,\" returned Father Underhill. \"We started\r\nfrom most of the nations of Europe. We have had a French state, Dutch\r\nand German, English and Scotch, but the one language seems a great\r\nleveler.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girls talked about the concert. Doctor Joe said he thought\r\nDaisy might venture. She was beginning to grow quite courageous, though\r\nthe comments on her lameness always brought a flush to her cheek.\r\nSometimes he stopped at school for both girls, and the wheeling-chair\r\nwent home empty. His strong, tender arm was help enough.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed had quite a battle to win the day for his son. \"The\r\nsinging-school was foolishness and a waste of time; and there was not a\r\nmoment to waste in this world, when you had to give a strict account of\r\nit in the next.\" Mrs. Reed had never considered whether so much scouring\r\nand scrubbing was not a waste of time, when everything was as clean as a\r\npin. When a very polite note from Mr. Bradbury reached Mr. Reed, begging\r\nthat Charles might be allowed to take a prominent part in the concert,\r\nthere was war, a more dreadful time than going to the barber had caused.\r\n\r\n\"Charles\"--she occasionally left off the John Robert--\"was too big a boy\r\nfor such nonsense! It spoiled children to put them forward. He ought to\r\nbe thinking of his lessons and forming his character, instead of\r\nspending his time over silly songs. And to sing on a public stage!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some of the best families are to let their children participate in it.\r\nI don't think it will hurt them,\" her husband said decisively.\r\n\r\nThen she actually sobbed.\r\n\r\n\"You will ruin that child, after all the trouble I've taken. I've worked\r\nand slaved from morning till night, made him get his lessons and be\r\ncareful of his clothes, and kept him out of bad company; and now I'm\r\nnot allowed to say a word, but just stand by while you let him go to\r\nruin. The next thing we'll have him in a nigger minstrel band, or\r\nplaying on a fiddle!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've known some very worthy men who played on a fiddle. And all the\r\nchildren growing up can't be minstrels, so perhaps our boy will be\r\ncompelled to find some other employment. I am going to have him like\r\nother boys; and if it can't be so at home, I'll send him away to\r\nschool.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a terrible threat. To be gone months at a time, with no one to\r\nlook after his clothes!\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed went about the house sighing, and scrubbed harder than ever.\r\nShe made Charles feel as if he brought in dirt by the bushel, and\r\nscattered it about in pure spite. She even refused his help in clearing\r\naway the dishes; and she tried to make him wear his second-best clothes\r\nthat eventful evening.\r\n\r\nOh, what an evening it was! The hall was crowded. The stage was full of\r\nchildren, one tier of seats rising above another. The girls were dressed\r\nin white, and most of them had their hair curled. The boys had a white\r\nribbon tied in the buttonhole of their jackets. How eager and pretty\r\nthey looked! Hanny thought of the day at Castle Garden when the\r\nSunday-schools had walked.\r\n\r\nIt was a simple cantata, but a great success. Charles Reed sang\r\ncharmingly. His father had said, \"Don't get frightened, my boy, and do\r\nyour very best;\" and he was just as desirous of pleasing his father as\r\nany one, even Mr. Bradbury.\r\n\r\nDaisy Jasper could have listened all night, entranced. Tall Doctor Joe\r\nsat beside her, easing her position now and then, while Hanny smiled and\r\nmade joyful comments of approval in so soft a tone they disturbed no\r\none.\r\n\r\n\"I've never been so happy in all my life,\" Daisy Jasper said to Doctor\r\nJoe. \"It seems as if I could never feel miserable again. There are so\r\nmany splendid things in the world that I am glad to live and be among\r\nthem, if I can't ever be quite straight and strong.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear child!\" Doctor Joe's eyes said the rest.\r\n\r\nThey waited for the crowd to get out. Charles came down the aisle with\r\nhis father and Mr. Bradbury, and Mr. Dean was escorting his little\r\ngirls. They had a very delightful chat, and were charmed with the leader\r\nof the children's concert.\r\n\r\n\"Charles must take good care of his voice,\" said Mr. Bradbury. \"It may\r\nsometime prove a fortune to him. He is a fine boy, and any father might\r\nwell be proud of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I just wish mother had wanted to be there,\" Charles said, as his\r\nfather was opening the door with his latch-key. The light was turned low\r\nin the hall, and Mrs. Reed had gone to bed, an unprecedented step with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHanny found that she couldn't spend all the Saturdays with little\r\nStevie. She wished they were twice as long; but they always seemed\r\nshorter than any other day. Dolly came down now and then, and was just\r\nas bright and merry as ever.\r\n\r\nBut old Mr. Beekman grew more feeble, and was confined to the house most\r\nof the time. Hanny had to go down-town and visit him and Katschina. He\r\nwas delighted to have her come, and Katschina purred her tenderest\r\nwelcome. She was like a bit of sunshine, with her cheerful smile and her\r\nsweet, merry wisdom. She told him about the school and Daisy, their\r\nplays and songs; and they were never tired of talking about Stephen's\r\nbaby. It could laugh aloud now; the reddish fuzz was falling out, and\r\nthe new soft hair shone like pale gold on his pink scalp.\r\n\r\nThere were so many other friends, the Bounett cousins, and Dele Whitney,\r\nwho was just as jolly as ever, with the old aunts down in Beach Street,\r\nand who declared the little girl was the sweetest thing in the world,\r\nand that some day she should just steal her, and carry her off to\r\nfairyland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAN INTERVIEW WITH A TIGER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came to New York in May a menagerie. A chance like this roused the\r\nchildren to a pitch of the wildest enthusiasm. Wonderful posters were\r\nput up. It was not considered a circus at all, but a moral and\r\ninstructive show, if it did not have delightful Artemas Ward to\r\nexpatiate upon it. There were a great many children who had never seen\r\nan elephant. Hanny Underhill had not.\r\n\r\nJim said, \"There was a live lion stuffed with straw; a zebra that had\r\nfifty stripes from the tip of his nose to his tail, nary stripe alike; a\r\nlaughing hyena of the desert, who could cry like a child when he was\r\nhungry, and who devoured the people who came to his assistance, thereby\r\nshowing the total depravity of human nature; an elephant that could\r\ndance; and monkeys who climbed the highest trees and swung in the gentle\r\nzephyrs by the tail.\" The crowning point was that he had money enough\r\nsaved up to go.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated lion-tamer, a Mr. Van Amburgh, was to perform with some\r\ntrained animals. Oh, what a crowd there was!--most people going early\r\nso they could walk around and view the animals in their cages. There\r\nwere two beautiful striped hyenas, lithe as cats, and so restless you\r\nwere almost afraid they would find some loose bar and spring out at you.\r\nThe two lions roared tremendously when disturbed. A great cage full of\r\nthe funniest chattering monkeys, ready for nuts or cake or bits of\r\napples, and who could swing with their heads downward and turn\r\nastonishing somersaults. Many other curious animals that we see nowadays\r\nin Central Park; but, alas! there was no Park then, and such indulgences\r\nhad to be paid for.\r\n\r\nThe big elephant was very gentle, or in a gentle mood, which answered\r\nthe same purpose. The keeper had to have eyes everywhere to see that the\r\nboys did not torment him. How he could take a peanut or a bit of candy\r\nin his trunk, and carry it up to his mouth without dropping it, puzzled\r\nHanny. For of course all the First Street children went. Mr. Underhill\r\nand Margaret and Mrs. Dean were to keep them safe and in order.\r\n\r\nIt seemed so hard to leave Daisy Jasper out. But her father could not\r\ngo, and her mother was much too timid.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be her knight,\" said Doctor Joe. \"I will take her up in the buggy,\r\nand we'll squeeze through the crowd.\"\r\n\r\nThat settled it. Seeing real live animals was so different from the\r\nstuffed and moth-eaten ones at Barnum's.\r\n\r\nThere was a great tent and some temporary sheds, with one or two\r\nside-shows. They went quite early, and Doctor Joe paid a man to stand\r\nguard over some seats while they walked around and inspected the cages.\r\nThere was a smaller trick elephant, but even Columbus was not as big as\r\nthe famous Jumbo.\r\n\r\nOne of the great pleasures or curiosities was a ride on his back in a\r\nhowdah. This was ten cents extra, and only for children. Most of the\r\nboys had spent their money for refreshments at the booths, so they could\r\nonly look longingly. The little girls were afraid at first.\r\n\r\n\"I am going,\" declared Charles Reed. \"Oh, you will not be afraid!\"--to\r\nthe Deans.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to?\" asked Mr. Underhill of his little girl.\r\n\r\nHanny drew a long breath and her eyes dilated. The howdah filled up, and\r\nthe ponderous creature moved slowly down to the end of the space and up\r\nagain, amid childish exclamations and laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--I would like to go,\" said Hanny, when she realised the safety of\r\nthe proceeding.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Doctor Joe, couldn't you help me up? It would be such a wonderful\r\nthing to ride on an elephant that I should be glad all my life.\"\r\n\r\nDaisy Jasper looked so eager and pleading out of her beseeching blue\r\neyes. So many pleasures must be foregone that he had not the heart to\r\ndeny this.\r\n\r\n\"Are you quite sure you will not be afraid up there?\" he asked\r\nearnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not with Hanny, dear Doctor Joe!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at Hanny. The little girl could climb trees and walk out to\r\nthe ends of the limbs and jump; she had swung her arms and said one,\r\ntwo, three, and gone flying over the creek without falling in; she could\r\ndo \"vinegar\" with a skipping rope; she could walk the edge of the\r\ncurb-stone without tilting over; she could swing ever so high and not\r\nwink; she wasn't afraid to go up stairs in the dark; but when the\r\nelephant took the first long, rocking step, she felt something as she\r\nhad when Luella Bounett had run downstairs with her in her arms. She\r\ngrasped Daisy's hand on the one side and Charlie's arm on the other.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hanny, you're not afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's like being out at sea,\" and Daisy laughed.\r\n\r\nBut the back of the huge creature seemed up so high and his steps so\r\nlong. Then she summoned all her courage, and resolved that she would not\r\nbe a \"little 'fraid cat.\"\r\n\r\nThe keeper interspersed the rides with stories of elephants in India\r\ntaking care of babies, fanning flies away from them, watching over sick\r\nmasters, and moving great timbers. Even if his eyes were small, he could\r\nsee any danger. You could trust him when he was once your friend; but he\r\nnever forgave an injury.\r\n\r\nThe big india-rubber feet came down with scarcely a sound. He flapped\r\nhis ears lazily, he turned around without spilling them out, and marched\r\nup the line as if it was just nothing at all.\r\n\r\nDaisy was thrilling with enjoyment. Her eyes shone and her cheeks were\r\nlike roses. She even put her hand on the elephant's crumply back, as\r\nthey came down the steps, and smiled in Doctor Joe's face, as he held\r\nher by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"You were so good to let me go. Thank you a thousand times. It was just\r\nsplendid!\"\r\n\r\nThey were all in a burst of enthusiasm with \"ohs and ahs.\" But Hanny was\r\nvery glad to get back to her father's protecting hand. She felt as if\r\nshe had been on a long and perilous journey.\r\n\r\nThey took their seats, and after one more caravan the performances\r\nbegan. The trick elephant did several odd things rather clumsily. Then\r\nhe stood on his head, and the boys clapped their hands with delight. He\r\ntrumpeted, and the very ground seemed to shake. Then he looked around in\r\na queer sort of fashion, as if he was sure he had frightened everybody.\r\n\r\nBut what would they have said to the later acrobatic feats and going\r\nthrough the figures of a quadrille! Half-a-dozen elephants would have\r\nstartled any audience.\r\n\r\nPresently a big cage was uncovered, and Mr. Van Amburgh went into the\r\nlions' den. Everybody shuddered a little. Hanny thought of the story of\r\nDaniel--perhaps other people did. He shook hands and rubbed shoulders\r\nwith them; and they put their paws on his shoulders and shook their\r\nshaggy heads.\r\n\r\nCharles said they ought to have finer bodies for such magnificent heads.\r\n\r\nThen the lion-tamer told them to lie down. He made a bed of one and a\r\npillow of the other, and threw himself upon them, hugging them up. He\r\nmade them open their mouths, and he thrust in his hand. They pranced up\r\nand down, sprang over the stick he held in his hand, jumped over him;\r\nand it really seemed as if they had a tender regard for him. But Doctor\r\nJoe observed that he always faced them, and kept his eyes steadily upon\r\nthem. The applause was tremendous.\r\n\r\nThen an incident occurred that was not down in the programme. A handsome\r\ntiger walked out from between two of the cages as if he had a part to\r\nplay. He scanned the audience in a deliberate manner; he gave his lithe\r\nbody a twist, and switched his tail in a graceful fashion, while his\r\nyellow eyes illumined the space about him. The attention of the audience\r\nwas concentrated upon him, while he appeared to be considering what to\r\ndo next.\r\n\r\nTwo keepers came out, while a man in the space between the cages shook\r\nsomething in his hand. The tiger turned and followed him, and the men\r\nwatched until a bar snapped.\r\n\r\nThen one of them faced the audience.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began, \"I wish to announce that there is not\r\nthe slightest danger. The tiger is securely caged. The animals are under\r\nperfect control.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three women screamed, and one fainted. Several hurried to the\r\nentrance; but the keeper begged them to be tranquil. There had not been\r\nthe slightest danger.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe motioned to his party to remain seated while he went to\r\nattend to the women. The performance was mostly over, and the audience\r\nbegan to disperse, from a sense of insecurity.\r\n\r\n\"Was he really loose?\" asked Tudie Dean, in a little fright.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he was,\" replied Charles. \"I'm not sure but it was done\r\npurposely after all.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe returned, and they appealed to him.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\"--with a gay air,--\"the tiger was quite obedient, wasn't he? You\r\nwere not frightened, Daisy?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you stood right there,\"--Doctor Joe had given his seat to a lady\r\njust as the performance began. \"Why, he looked at you,\" and Daisy's\r\nnerves gave a little quiver.\r\n\r\n\"I supposed Mr. Van Amburgh would come and put him through some paces,\"\r\nreturned Joe.\r\n\r\n\"It was immense, wasn't it?\" exclaimed Jim. \"But why did the woman\r\nsqueal when it was all over?\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe laughed.\r\n\r\nTo make amends, a pretty trick pony came out, who really could dance,\r\nand he looked as if he laughed, too. He did a number of amusing things,\r\nand the audience stopped going out. Then the monkeys set up such a\r\nshrill chatter that the people began to laugh. The lion started to roar;\r\nand it seemed as if the tigers joined the chorus. For a few moments it\r\nwas a forest concert.\r\n\r\n\"If only the hyena would laugh,\" said Jim. The girls were a little\r\nnervous. Joe had gone to get Prince. \"Oh, you needn't be a mite afraid.\r\nMr. Van Amburgh would just have thrown a cloth over his head; and in his\r\nsurprise they would have had him all right in a moment. I would not have\r\nmissed it for a dollar; though I wouldn't care to encounter him in his\r\nnative wilds.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did look grand surveying the audience,\" said Daisy. \"I am so glad I\r\ncould come--for everything.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor put Hanny and Daisy in the buggy, as they were both so slim.\r\nHanny hugged his arm, and said in a voice still a trifle shaky,--\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you the least bit frightened, Joe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I never imagined there was any danger until it was over. I think\r\nso many people rather dazed Mr. Tiger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if anything had happened to you, what should I do?\" asked Daisy,\r\nwith lustrous eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is going to happen to me. You have been a brave girl this\r\nafternoon, and it is not the first time either.\"\r\n\r\nHer cheek flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\nIt was a great thing to talk over, that and the ride on the elephant.\r\nHanny found her natural history, and she and her father read about\r\nelephants most of the evening.\r\n\r\nThe days were so pleasant that the children often took Daisy out in her\r\nchair to see them at their plays. They went around to Houston Street, to\r\nthe German settlement, as it was beginning to be called. Lena and\r\nGretchen were out on their stoop with their knitting, and the baby\r\nbetween them. They were Lutherans, and they looked quite different from\r\nthe Jews.\r\n\r\nThere were still quaint old houses in Ludlow and Orchard streets,--two\r\nstories with dormer windows in the roof, and some frame cottages with\r\nstruggling grass-plots. No one dreamed of the tall tenements that were\r\nto take their places, the sewing-machines that were to hum while the\r\nworkers earned their scanty pittance, and swarms of children crowded the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nEverybody had more leisure then. Some of the women sat and chatted while\r\ntheir little ones played about.\r\n\r\nA little girl came out of an alley way with a peculiar jerky movement,\r\nlike a hop and a skip, while she kept one hand on her knee. Her hip was\r\nlarge, her shoulder pushed up and apparently bent over.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" she said to Hanny. \"What's the matter with her?\" nodding her\r\nhead. \"Wish't I had a cheer like that. I'd cut a great swell. My! ain't\r\nshe pritty?\"\r\n\r\n\"She's been ill,\" returned Hanny.\r\n\r\nThe child stared a moment and then hopped on.\r\n\r\n\"Her father works about the stable,\" explained Hanny, with rising\r\ncolour. \"She comes up sometimes. They're very poor. Mother gives them\r\never so many things. She can't stand up straight; but she doesn't seem\r\nto mind. And one leg is so much shorter. The boys call her Cricket, and\r\nLimpy Dick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hanny, if I were poor and like that!\" The tears came in Daisy's\r\neyes. \"I can stand up straight, and I am getting to walk quite well. I\r\nhave so much that is lovely and comforting; and oughtn't one be thankful\r\nnot to be real poor?\"\r\n\r\nThe little lameter went hopping across the street, and called to some\r\nchildren \"to look at the style!\"\r\n\r\nDown by the corner there was a candy and notion store, kept by an old\r\nwoman with a queer wrinkled face framed in with a wide cap-ruffle. She\r\nhad a funny turned-up nose, as if it had hardly known which way to grow,\r\nand such round red-apple cheeks. When it was pleasant, she sat in the\r\ndoorway, regardless of the fate of the heroic young woman of Norway.\r\n\r\n\"Good day!\" she ejaculated. \"The Lord bless ye. Yon's got a pretty face,\r\nan' I hope it will bring her good fortune.\" She nodded, and her\r\ncap-ruffle flapped over her face.\r\n\r\n\"If ye see that omadhawn of a Biddy Brady in yer travels, jist send her\r\nhome. The babby's screamin' himself into fits. Won't her mother give it\r\nto her whin she comes in!\"\r\n\r\nDown below the next corner, there was a throng of children. One big boy\r\nwas whistling a jig tune, and clapping on his knee.\r\n\r\n\"That's old Mrs. McGiven,\" explained Hanny. \"The school-children go\r\nthere for cake and candy and slate pencils, because hers have such nice\r\nsharp points. And--Biddy Brady!\"\r\n\r\nJim was with the boys. He gave Hanny a nod and laughed and joined the\r\nwhistling.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jim--Biddy's baby is crying--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, start up again, Biddy. You haven't given us half a cent's worth!\r\nYou don't dance as good as the little Jew girl on the next block.\"\r\n\r\n\"Arrah now--\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on wid yer dancin'.\"\r\n\r\nBiddy was a thin, lanky girl with straight dark hair that hung in her\r\neyes and over her shoulders. A faded checked pinafore, with just plain\r\narm-holes, covered her nearly all up. To her spindle legs were attached\r\nmismatched shoes, twice too large, tied around the ankles. One had a\r\nloose sole that flapped up and down. It really wasn't any dancing, for\r\nshe just kicked out one foot and then the other, with such vigor that\r\nyou wondered she didn't go over backward. Her very earnestness rendered\r\nit irresistibly funny. She certainly danced by main strength.\r\n\r\nHanny began again. \"Jim, her baby is crying--\"\r\n\r\n\"He gets his living by crying. I've never heard of his doing anything\r\nelse.\"\r\n\r\nBiddy brought her foot down with an emphatic thump.\r\n\r\n\"There now, not another step do yees get out o' me fur that cint. I've\r\ngive ye good measure and fancy steps throwed in. An' me shoe is danced\r\noff me fut, an' me mammy'll lick me. See that now!\" and she held up her\r\nflapping sole.\r\n\r\nThey had to yield to necessity, for none of the crowd had another penny.\r\nWhen Biddy realised the fact, she ran off home and bought a stick of\r\ncandy to solace herself and the baby. Mrs. Brady went out washing, and\r\nBiddy cared for the baby when she wasn't in the street. It must be\r\nadmitted the babies languished under her care.\r\n\r\nThe school-children had a good deal of fun hiring her to dance. Biddy\r\nwas shrewd enough about the pennies.\r\n\r\nJim joined the cavalcade as the boys went their way.\r\n\r\n\"Why, she likes the money,\" he said in answer to an upbraiding remark\r\nfrom Hanny. \"That's what she does it for.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very funny,\" declared Daisy. \"She's such a straight, slim child\r\nin that long narrow apron. If it hadn't been for the baby, I would have\r\ngiven her a penny.\"\r\n\r\nThey went on down the street. There were several fancy-goods stores and\r\nsome pretty black-eyed Jewish children with the curliest hair\r\nimaginable. There was the big school across the way, and a great lock\r\nfactory, then a row of comparatively nice dwellings. They turned into\r\nAvenue A., and were in a crowd of Germans. The children and babies all\r\nhad flaxen or yellow hair and roundish blue eyes. The mothers were\r\nknitting and sewing and chattering in their queer language. Even the\r\nlittle girls were knitting lace and stockings. The boys seemed fat and\r\npudgy. They stared at the chair and its inmate, but Sam went quietly\r\nalong. Here were German costumes sure enough.\r\n\r\nThey turned up Second Street, and so around First Avenue, home.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's like going to foreign countries,\" Daisy said. \"Some of the\r\nchildren were very pretty. But that Biddy Brady--I can see her yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe very next day Daisy drew two pictures, and held them before Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's Biddy Brady!\" the little girl said, with a bright wondering\r\nlaugh. \"And that's old Mrs. McGiven! They're splendid! How could you do\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It came to me.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Craven said the old lady was excellent. And she laughed about Biddy\r\nBrady's dancing.\r\n\r\nSometimes they went up to Tompkins' Square. They would study their\r\nlessons or do a bit of crocheting. Daisy was learning a great many\r\nthings. Or they went a little farther up and over to the river, which\r\nwas much wider at that time. The old farms had been cut up into blocks;\r\nbut while they were waiting for some one to come along and build them\r\nup, the thrifty Germans had turned them into market gardens, and they\r\npresented a very pretty appearance.\r\n\r\nThey could see the small clusters of houses on Long Island, and the end\r\nof Blackwell's Island,--a terrible place to them. The boys had seen the\r\n\"Black Maria,\" which the little girl thought must be some formidable\r\ngiant negress capable of driving the criminals along as one would a\r\nflock of sheep, and she was quite surprised when she learned it was a\r\nwagon merely. The East River was quite pretty up here, and the\r\nferry-boats made a line of foam that sparkled in the sun.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Doctor Joe joined the party, and took them in other\r\ndirections. He had accepted the offer of an old physician on East\r\nBroadway, which was then considered very aristocratic. The basement\r\nwindows had pretty lace curtains, and the dining-rooms had beaufets in\r\nthe corners, on which the glass and silver were arranged. The brass\r\ndoorknobs and the name-plate shone like gold, and the iron railings of\r\nthe stoops were finished with quite pretentious newels, that the\r\nchildren called sentry boxes.\r\n\r\nGrand Street, at the eastern end, had many private dwellings. Ridge and\r\nPitt and Willet streets were quite steep and made splendid coasting\r\nplaces in winter. There was the Methodist church, in which many famous\r\nworthies had preached, and even at the end of the century the old place\r\nkeeps its brave and undaunted front.\r\n\r\nStrawberries did not come until June; and the girls took them round the\r\nstreets in tiny deep baskets. There were no such mammoth berries as we\r\nhave now; but, oh, how sweet and luscious they were! Little girls\r\ncarried baskets of radishes from door to door, and first you heard\r\n\"strawbrees,\" then something that sounded like \"ask arishee,\" which I\r\nsuppose was brief for \"ask any radishes.\"\r\n\r\nThe fish and clam men were a great delight to the children. One curious,\r\nweather-beaten old fellow who went through First Street had quite a\r\nmusical horn, and a regular song.\r\n\r\n    \"Fine clams, fine clams, fine clams, to-day,\r\n    That have just arrived from Rockaway.\r\n    They're good to boil, and they're good to fry,\r\n    And they're good to make a clam pot-pie.\r\n    My horse is hired, and my waggon isn't mine.\r\n    Look out, little boys, don't cut behind!\"\r\n\r\nWhere the rhyme was lame, he made up with an extra flourish and trill to\r\nthe notes. The cats used to watch out for him. They seemed to know when\r\nFriday came, and they would be sitting on the front stoops, dozing until\r\nthey heard the welcome sound of the horn. There were huckster waggons\r\nwith vegetables, and a buttermilk man.\r\n\r\nAn old coloured woman used to come round with brewer's yeast, and one\r\nmorning she had a great piece of black cambric twisted about her bonnet.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you in mourning for, auntie?\" asked Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"My ol' man, Miss Margret. Happened so lucky! He jest died Sat'day\r\nnight, an' we buried him on Sunday, an' here I am goin' round on\r\nMonday,--not losin' any time. Happened so lucky!\"\r\n\r\nJim went into spasms of merriment over the economy of the incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCHANCES AND CHANGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Whitneys had moved in May, to the great regret of everybody. Their\r\nfamily had changed considerably through the winter. Archibald, the\r\nyounger son, was married, and Mr. Theodore had an opportunity to go\r\nabroad for a year.\r\n\r\nThe widowed cousin in Beach Street was married and went to Baltimore\r\nwith her two children. That left the two old aunts who owned the house\r\nquite alone. Mrs. Whitney and Delia had taken turns staying with them.\r\n\r\nThe children were all sorry to lose Nora and Pussy Gray.\r\n\r\n\"People say it's bad luck to move a cat,\" said Nora, in her sententious\r\nfashion; \"but we don't believe in it. We've moved him twice already. And\r\nyou just put a little butter on his feet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Butter!\" interrupted the children, amazed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. That's to make him wash his paws. If you can make him wash\r\nand purr in a new place, he will stay. And then you must take him round\r\nand show him every room and every closet. And you must come down real\r\noften, Hanny. There's the lovely little park, you know. Aunt Boudinot\r\nhas a key. They're such nice queer old ladies, you'll be sure to like\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't always like queer people,\" said Hanny, rather affronted.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean cross or ugly. Aunt Clem has soft down all over her\r\ncheeks, and such curly white hair. She's awful old and wrinkled and\r\ndeaf; but Dele can make her hear splendid. Aunt Patty isn't so old. Her\r\nreal name is Patricia. And Aunt Clem's is Clementine.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were not alone in regret. Ben was almost broken-hearted to\r\nlose Mr. Theodore. The boy and the man had been such good friends. And\r\nBen was quite resolved, when he had served his apprenticeship, and was\r\ntwenty-one, to be a newspaper man and travel about the world.\r\n\r\nDelia had told them quite a wonderful secret the day she came up after\r\nsome articles her mother had left. She had written some verses, and had\r\nthem printed unknown to any one. The. had said they were very fair. And\r\nshe had actually been paid for a story; and the editor of the paper\r\noffered to take others, if they were just as good. She had changed her\r\ncheck for a five-dollar goldpiece, which she carried about with her for\r\nluck. She showed it to them; and they felt as if they had seen a\r\nmysterious object.\r\n\r\nHanny was greatly amazed, puzzled as well. That a grown man like Mr.\r\nTheodore should write grave columns of business matters for a newspaper\r\nhad not surprised her; she had a vague idea that people who wrote\r\nverses and stories must needs be lovely. She pictured them with floating\r\ncurls and eyes turned heavenward for inspiration. It seemed to her that\r\nbeautiful thoughts must come from the clouds. Then their voices should\r\nbe soft, their hands delicate. And the divine something that no\r\ndictionary has ever yet found a word to describe must surround them.\r\nThere was a fair-haired girl at school who had such an exquisite smile.\r\nAnd Daisy Jasper! For her to write verses would be the supreme fitness\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nBut careless, laughing, untidy Dele Whitney, neither fair nor dark\r\nand--yes, freckled, though her hair was more brown than red now. And to\r\nlaugh about it, and toss up her goldpiece and catch it with her other\r\nhand!\r\n\r\n\"Handsome!\" Ben ejaculated when Hanny confided some of her difficulties\r\nto him in a very timid fashion. \"Great people don't need to run to\r\nbeauty. Still, Mr. Audubon had a lovely face, to my thinking,\" he added,\r\nwhen he saw how disappointed the little girl looked. \"And, oh! see here,\r\nMr. Willis is handsome and Gaylord Clark, and there is that picture of\r\nMrs. Hemans--\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl smiled. Dr. Hoffman had given Margaret a beautifully\r\nbound copy of Mrs. Hemans's poems, and the steel engraving in the front\r\n_was_ handsome. She had already learned two of the poems, and recited\r\nthem at school.\r\n\r\n\"And I don't think Delia so very plain,\" continued Ben. \"You just watch\r\nwhat beautiful curves there are to her lips, and her brown eyes lighten\r\nup like morning; and when they are a little sad, you can think that\r\ntwilight overshadows her. I like to watch them change so. I'm awfully\r\nsorry they're gone away. If we _could_ have another big brother, I'd\r\nlike it to be Mr. Theodore.\"\r\n\r\nHanny used to hope when she was as big as Margaret she would be as\r\npretty. She didn't think very much about it, only now and then some of\r\nthe cousins said,--\r\n\r\n\"Hanny doesn't seem to grow a bit. And how very light her hair keeps!\r\nYou'd hardly think she and Margaret were sisters.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girls drew mysteriously closer after Nora went away. They all\r\nkept on at the same school, and played together. But dolls and tea\r\nparties didn't appear to have quite the zest of a year ago.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday, Mr. Underhill took Hanny down to Beach Street. They were\r\nall delighted to see her, even to Pussy Gray, who came and rubbed\r\nagainst her, and stretched up until he reached her waist, and, oh, how\r\nhe did purr!\r\n\r\n\"I think he's been kind of homesick for the children,\" remarked Nora,\r\ngravely, as if she might be quite grown up. \"You see he _was_ spoiled\r\namong you all. I was a little afraid at first that he would run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you put butter on his paws?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. He licked them, and then washed his face; but he kept looking\r\naround and listening to strange noises. He'd sit on the window-sill and\r\nwatch the children, and cry to go out. But he doesn't mind now.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a chair and a cushion to himself, and looked very contented.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs to see the old ladies. Aunt Clem had a round, full,\r\nbaby-face, for all she was so old. Nora said she was almost ninety. Aunt\r\nPatty was twenty years younger, quite brisk and bright, with wonderful\r\nblue eyes. They had the front room upstairs, and their bed stood in the\r\nalcove. The furnishing looked like some of the country houses. Mrs.\r\nWhitney had the back room, and Nora shared it with her. There were great\r\npantries between with shelves and drawers, and in one a large chest,\r\npainted green, that Nora said was full of curiosities.\r\n\r\nDelia's room was up on the top floor. She had made it oddly pretty.\r\nThere was a book-case and the small desk. They had used, ever so many\r\npictures, and a pot of flowers on a little table. It had quite an\r\norderly aspect.\r\n\r\n\"And I have another five-dollar goldpiece,\" laughed the girl. \"I shall\r\nbe a nabob presently. I ought to invest my money; but it is so\r\ncomforting to look at, that I hate to let it go.\"\r\n\r\nThen Hanny had to tell them about the new neighbours. They were\r\nforeigners, by the name of Levy; and there were four grown people, five\r\nlittle children, and two servants. Mr. Levy was an importer, and they\r\nall seemed jolly and noisy, but did not talk English, so there could\r\nnot be any friendliness, even if they cared.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon be a foreign city,\" declared Mrs. Whitney. \"It's\r\nastonishing how the foreigners do come in! No wonder people have to move\r\nup-town.\"\r\n\r\nNora and Hanny went over in the Park after dinner. But it wasn't much\r\nfun to be alone; so they walked up and down the street, and then Delia\r\ntook them in the stage down to the Battery. People were promenading in\r\ngala attire. Saturday afternoon had quite a holiday aspect. There was a\r\nbig steamer coming up the bay. The Whitneys had heard twice from Mr.\r\nTheodore, who was now going over to Ireland.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Ben that The. is going to write to him,\" remarked Dele. \"He said\r\nso in his last letter.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to Beach Street, they found Doctor Joe waiting for\r\nHanny. But Ben said afterward he wished he had gone instead, he was\r\nquite longing to see them all. And he was delighted with the prospect of\r\na letter.\r\n\r\nWhether they would have liked their new neighbours or not, if they could\r\nhave talked to them, made little difference to Mrs. Underhill. Margaret\r\nwas to be married in the early autumn. Dr. Hoffman had bought a house\r\nnot very far from Stephen's, in a new row that was just being finished.\r\nHe wouldn't like it to stand empty, and he did not want to rent it for a\r\nyear, and perhaps have the pretty fresh aspect spoiled. And then it was\r\nbetter for a doctor to be married and settled.\r\n\r\nFather Underhill sighed. Mrs. Underhill said sharply that she couldn't\r\nget ready; but for all that, pieces of muslin came into the house for\r\nsheets and pillow-cases, and Margaret was busy as a bee.\r\n\r\nAnother trouble loomed up before the anxious housekeeper. A sprightly\r\nwidower belonging to the same church as Martha, came home with her every\r\nSunday night, and class-meeting night, which was Thursday.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to consider well,\" counseled Mrs. Underhill. \"A stepmother is\r\na sort of thankless office. And two big boys!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I'm used to boys. They're not so bad when you know how to take\r\nthem, and they'll soon be grown up. Then he's quite forehanded. He owns\r\na house in Stanton Street, and has a good business, carting leather in\r\nthe Swamp.\"\r\n\r\nThe Swamp was the centre for tanneries and leather importers and\r\ndealers, and it still keeps its name and location.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I shall do!\" with a heavy sigh.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have good long warning. I wouldn't be mean enough to go off and\r\nleave you with all this fuss and worry on your hands. And, land sakes!\r\nhis wife hasn't been dead a year yet. I told him I couldn't think of\r\nsuch a thing before Christmas, anyhow. But he has such a hard time with\r\nboth grandmothers. One comes and fixes things her way, and gets tired\r\nand goes off, and then the other one comes and upsets them. It's just\r\ndreadful! I do believe a man needs a second wife more than he did the\r\nfirst. They're poor sticks to get along alone when they've had some one\r\nto look after things. And when this affair is over, you'll kind of\r\nsettle down, and the family seem smaller. Just don't fret a bit, for the\r\nwhole thing may fall through.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't want you to give up the prospect of a good home,\" rather\r\nreluctantly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what I've thought about. And I ain't a young girl with\r\nyears of chances before me. But I'm not going to be caught too easy,\"\r\nand Martha tossed her head.\r\n\r\nBen was very much interested in the war that was going on now in good\r\nearnest. The Americans had taken Fort Brown, crossed to the Rio Grande\r\nand driven the Mexicans from Matamoras. A plan had been laid to attack\r\nMexico on the Pacific side, and to invade both Old and New Mexico. Santa\r\nAnna had escaped from his exile in Cuba, and was longing to reconquer\r\nTexas. The whole question seemed in great confusion; but there was a\r\ngreat deal of enthusiasm among some of the younger men, who thought war\r\na rather heroic thing, and they were hurrying off to the scene of\r\naction. There was a spirit of adventure and curiosity about the\r\nwonderful western coast.\r\n\r\nGeorge Horton used to talk all these matters over with Ben, when he came\r\ndown on his occasional visits. He was a fine big fellow now, but he was\r\ngetting tired of farming. It was quite lonely. Uncle Faid read the\r\ncounty paper, but was not specially interested in the questions of the\r\nday; and Retty and her husband never went beyond stock, and the crops,\r\nand the baby. Ben kept his brother supplied with books that opened a\r\nwider outlook for him, and made him a little discontented with the\r\nhumdrum round.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't mind it if you were all there,\" he would say. \"After all the\r\ncity is the only real live place! I've half a mind to come down and\r\nlearn a trade. Only I _do_ like the wide out of doors. I couldn't stand\r\nbeing cooped up.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm going round the world some day,\" returned Ben.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to go out with Frémont. The other side of our country seems so\r\ncurious to me, I want to see what it is like. The other side of the\r\nRocky Mountains! It's almost like saying the Desert of Sahara,\" and the\r\nyoung fellow laughed.\r\n\r\nThere was the usual spring and summer dress-making for the ladies. Even\r\nMiss Cynthia, looking sharply at Hanny, said:--\r\n\r\n\"I don't see what's the matter with that child! I supposed she'd have\r\neverything outgrown, and some of her last summer's skirts won't need any\r\nletting down. They're wearing them shorter now; and you know, Cousin\r\nUnderhill, you would have them made rather long last summer.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl sometimes felt quite sore on the point. The Deans were\r\ngetting to be tall girls, and even Daisy Jasper had taken to growing.\r\nAnd her lovely curls were quite long again. She certainly was very\r\npretty.\r\n\r\nBut when Hanny took this trouble to her father, he only laughed and\r\nsqueezed her in his arms, and sometimes rubbed her soft cheeks with his\r\nbeard, his old trick, as he said:--\r\n\r\n\"But I want to keep you my little girl. I don't want you to grow big\r\nlike Margaret. For if you should, some nice fellow will come along and\r\ninsist upon carrying you off, and then I should lose you. Whatever would\r\nI do?\"\r\n\r\nThat view of the matter was alarming to contemplate. She clung closer to\r\nher father, and said, in a half-frightened tone, that she never would be\r\ncarried off. It quite reconciled her to the fact of not growing rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe girls all went down to see Nora Whitney one Saturday in June. It\r\nlooked rather threatening in the morning, but a yard or two of blue sky\r\ngave them hope. Mr. Underhill took them all in the family carriage. Oh,\r\nhow lovely the little park looked with its soft grass and waving trees!\r\nAnd in the area windows there were pots of flowers: ten-weeks' stock,\r\nand spice pinks, and geraniums that were considered quite a rarity.\r\n\r\nNora was out on the front stoop with Pussy Gray, who arched his back and\r\nwaved his tail with an air of grandeur, and then sat down on the top\r\nstep and began to wash his face, while Father Underhill was planning to\r\ntake them all for a drive late in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nPussy Gray watched his little mistress out of one green eye, and washed\r\nover one ear. He was just going over the other when Nora caught him,\r\n\"Why do you stop him?\" asked Daisy.\r\n\r\n\"Because he wants to make it rain and spoil our day. Pussy Gray--if you\r\ndo!\"\r\n\r\n\"But it wouldn't really?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's a sure sign when he goes over both ears. When I don't want\r\nit to rain, I stop him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose he does it when he is by himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think sometimes he runs away and does it on the sly. Aunt Patty says\r\nit is as sure as sure can be.\"\r\n\r\nPussy Gray winked at Hanny, as if he said he didn't believe in signs,\r\nand that he should wash over both ears when he found a chance.\r\n\r\nDele was bright and merry. She \"bossed\" the house, for Mrs. Whitney had\r\nsubsided into novel-reading again, and now took books out of the\r\nMercantile Library. A woman was doing the Saturday morning's work, and\r\nscrubbing the areas. After that she went over the front one with a red\r\nwash that looked like paint, and freshened it. The girls took a run in\r\nthe yard. There was a long flower-bed down the side of the fence, and at\r\none end all manner of sweet herbs, lavender, thyme, and rosemary, sweet\r\nverbena, and then tansy and camomile, and various useful things.\r\n\r\n\"Camomile tea is good for you when you lose your appetite,\" said Nora;\r\n\"but it's awful bitter. Aunt Patty cuts off the leaves and blossoms of\r\nthe sweet herbs, and sews them up in little bags of fine muslin, and\r\nlays them among the clothes and the nice towels and pillow-cases. And\r\nit makes them all smell just delicious.\"\r\n\r\nThe air was full of fragrance now. They played tag around the\r\ngrass-plot. Daisy sat on the stoop and said she didn't mind, though she\r\ngave a little sigh, and wondered how it would feel to run about. The\r\nlittle lame girl in Houston Street could get over the ground pretty\r\nrapidly. She had interested Doctor Joe in her, and he had hunted up the\r\nchild's mother, who wouldn't listen to anything being done for her.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said she, \"if it's the Lord's will to send this affliction to\r\nher, I'll not be flying in the face of Providence. She can manage, and\r\nshe's impident enough now. There'd be no livin' with her if she had two\r\ngood legs. And I'll not have any doctor cuttin' her up into mince-meat.\"\r\n\r\nPussy Gray came and sat beside Daisy with a flick of the ear and turn of\r\nthe tail, as if he said: \"We'll let those foolish girls fly about and\r\nsqueal and laugh and get half roasted, while we sit here at leisure and\r\nenjoy ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nAfterward they swung, and then went up to Nora's play-house. Aunt Patty\r\nhad given her a rag doll that she had when she was a little girl, and it\r\nwas over fifty years old. It was undeniably sweet, because it had been\r\nsteeped in lavender, but it was not very pretty. There was a curious\r\nlittle wooden cradle Aunt Patty's brother had made. All the children's\r\nstory-books were up here in a case Dele had made out of a packing box.\r\n\r\nThey thought after a little they would rather go over in the Park. Nora\r\ntook the key. It was very pleasant; and they watched the carts and\r\nwaggons going by, and the pedestrians. Presently a young woman unlocked\r\nthe gate at the lower end, and came in with two little children rather\r\nqueerly dressed. She had a white muslin cap on her head, very high in\r\nfront. We often see them now, but then they were a rarity. The little\r\nchildren had very black eyes and curly black hair, and stared curiously\r\nat the group of girls.\r\n\r\n\"They're French,\" explained Nora. \"They live a few doors down below. And\r\nthey can't speak a word of English, nor the maid either, though we do\r\nsometimes talk a little. There are two quite big boys, then the mother\r\nand father, and the grandmother and grandfather. The old people come out\r\nand sit on the stoop, now that it is warm. He reads French books to her,\r\nand she makes lace. About four o'clock, the servant brings out a\r\ntea-table, and they have some tea and little bits of cake. They do it\r\nall summer long, Aunt Patty says, and the old lady is beautiful,--just\r\nlike a picture.\"\r\n\r\nThe girls walked down a little. The maid smiled and nodded. The children\r\nmade queer stiff bows, both alike, though they were girl and boy; but\r\nthey looked half afraid. The maid said \"Bon jour\" to Nora, who replied\r\nwith a longer sentence. And then she began to explain in English and her\r\nscanty French that these were her friends, and that they were studying\r\nFrench in school. The Deans talked a little; but Hanny was too shy, and\r\nthe conversation would have been very amusing to a spectator. But just\r\nwhen it was getting quite exciting, and they couldn't make each other\r\nunderstand at all, Hanny caught sight of Delia waving her handkerchief\r\nfrom the front stoop, which was a signal that dinner was ready, so they\r\nall curtsied and said good-bye.\r\n\r\nAfterward Aunt Patty showed them her \"treasures,\" some very odd dishes\r\nand pitchers that were more than a hundred years old, and some jewels,\r\nand the gown Aunt Clem had worn to Washington's Inauguration, and told\r\nthem about Mrs. Washington and going to the old theatre in John Street.\r\nShe had some beautiful combs, and buckles that her father used to wear,\r\nand kid-gloves that had long arms and came most up to her shoulders. She\r\ntold the children so many entertaining stories that before the afternoon\r\nseemed half gone Mr. Underhill came for them. Nora wanted to go also.\r\n\r\n\"You can take her home with you,\" said Dele; \"and I'll come up for her\r\nthis evening. I'm just wild to see Mrs. Underhill and the boys. I hope\r\nthe children have had a good time. I've hardly had a glimpse of them\r\nexcept at dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThey crossed the ferry and went over to Jersey. It was still pretty wild\r\nand country-like, but the trees and shrubs and bloom everywhere lent it\r\na glory. The children chatted merrily, and all agreed the day was too\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n\"But you can come again,\" said Nora.\r\n\r\nWhen the Deans sprang out, Charles Reed stood by the stoop talking to\r\nMr. Dean. Nora said the place hadn't changed a bit, and she wished she\r\nwas back again. There were nothing but old people in Beach Street, and\r\nshe had no little girls to play with. She didn't know what she should do\r\nwhen vacation came.\r\n\r\nThey were just through supper when Delia arrived, and she insisted upon\r\nsitting down at the table and having a cup of Mrs. Underhill's good tea.\r\nShe was her olden jolly self, and had her brother's letters almost by\r\nheart. She thought them a great deal brighter and more amusing than\r\nthose published in the \"Tribune.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I like those,\" exclaimed Ben; \"I'm cutting them out for a\r\nscrap-book. I just wish I was with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"And he would like to have you,\" returned Dele. \"I don't believe he ever\r\ntook so much of a fancy to any one as he did to you.\"\r\n\r\nThey talked books a little. No, Dele had not written any more stories.\r\nThe old ladies took a good deal of her time. And she had been studying.\r\nShe wished she were going to school again; she should appreciate it so\r\nmuch more. She was reading the English essayists and Wordsworth, and\r\nlearning about the great men and women.\r\n\r\nBen walked out to the Bowery to put them in the stage; and Dele said,\r\nrather ruefully:--\r\n\r\n\"I just wish we could study and read together. I miss The. so much, I\r\ncould always ask him questions; but now I have to look up everything\r\nmyself, and it's slow work.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dele has quite a family on her hands,\" said John, when she had gone.\r\n\"She's getting to be rather good-looking, too. Her eyes are very fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she doesn't grow much tidier,\" returned his mother.\r\n\r\n\"Her hair is curly and always looks tumbled,\" was the half-apologising\r\nrejoinder. \"But she is very bright, and she'll do something with\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill glanced sharply at her son. There was no danger in Ben\r\nbeing a little soft about Delia Whitney; but she was surprised at John's\r\ncommendation.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe walked down to see how his patient had stood the day. Her\r\nmother had been almost afraid to have her go, lest \"something might\r\nhappen.\" She was very tired, of course, and glad to take to the\r\nreclining chair with all the pillows; but her eyes were in a glow, and\r\nher cheeks a pretty pink that Mrs. Jasper was quite sure was undue\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"It was just splendid,\" Daisy declared; \"Mamma, I do want to be like\r\nother girls, and see what is going on in the world. The old ladies were\r\nso quaint; and it was wonderful to have seen President Washington and so\r\nmany famous people. And what interested me, was her talking about them\r\njust like ordinary persons. And Nora is so amusing. I want to learn\r\nFrench so that I can really talk it. You can't imagine how funny it was\r\nin the Park, trying to make each other understand. Oh, there are so many\r\nthings I want to learn.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be time enough,\" said her mother.\r\n\r\nWhen Doctor Joe took her hand and bent over her to say good-night, she\r\nwhispered softly,--\r\n\r\n\"I _did_ try to forget my own misfortune, and I was very happy. I am\r\ngoing to be brave. It is such a lovely world; and it is such a splendid\r\nthing to be happy. Doctor Joe, you are my Mr. Greatheart.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nA WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a very fine noisy Fourth of July, and shortly after that came\r\nvacation. The Jaspers were going to Lebanon Springs, and then to\r\nSaratoga. Hanny came near to envying Daisy. She and Margaret had to\r\nvisit both grandmothers, and go over to Tarrytown, for the Morgans had\r\ninsisted upon it.\r\n\r\nHanny and her father had been reading some of Washington Irving's\r\nstories, beside his famous history. He was abroad now; he had been sent\r\nas Minister to the Court of Madrid, that wonderful Spanish city with its\r\nCourt so full of interest and beauty. She had been learning about it in\r\nher history. But this old house was not grand, only in its splendid elms\r\nand maples and lindens and tall arbor-vitæs. Wolfert's Roost was almost\r\nhidden by them; but you could catch glimpses of its curious roof, full\r\nof quaint corners and projections, and the old-fashioned stone mansion\r\nsaid to be modelled after the cocked hat of Peter the Headstrong. Its\r\nlow stories were full of nooks and angles. There were roses and\r\nhollyhocks like rows of sentinels, and sweet brier clambering about.\r\nThe little girl thought of it many a time afterward, when it had become\r\nmuch more famous, as Sunnyside. Indeed, she was to sit on the old piazza\r\noverlooking the river and listen to the pleasant voice that had charmed\r\nso many people, and study the drawings of Rip Van Winkle and Sleepy\r\nHollow, to hear about Katrina Van Tassel, and the churn full of water\r\nthat Fammetie Van Blarcom brought over from Holland because she was sure\r\nthere could be no water good to drink in the new country.\r\n\r\nAlready she was coming to have a great interest in people who wrote\r\nbooks and stories. It seemed such a wonderful gift.\r\n\r\nDr. Hoffman paid the cousins the compliment of a visit. Afterward there\r\nwere mysterious communings between the sisters.\r\n\r\nWedding presents were gifts of real preference and affection in those\r\ndays. A girl had her \"setting out\" from home, and perhaps some one gave\r\nher an heirloom for her name, or because she was an especial favourite.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hoffman's well-to-do,\" said Joanna; \"and Margaret's folks won't let\r\nher go empty-handed. But I'd like to have some of our things go where\r\nthey would be appreciated. We've no one of our very own to leave them\r\nto,\" and Miss Morgan sighed. \"Margaret doesn't consider store articles\r\nso much better than those made long ago. Let's each give her a pair of\r\nlinen sheets. I've a dozen good ones now, and, land sakes! we sha'n't\r\nwear out half our bedding. And my tablecloth of the basket pattern, and\r\ntwo towels. And--let me see--that white wool blanket of Aunt Hetty's. It\r\nwas spun and woven in 1800; and the sheep were raised here on the old\r\nfarm. Some peculiar kind they were, with long, soft fleece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Famie, slowly, \"there's my snowball tablecloth and two\r\ntowels. 'Rastus's wife won't ever care for them with her fine Paris\r\nthings. But we won't give away the silver, nor the old pewter flagon,\r\nnor the basin and cups. They've the crown mark on them, 1710 for a date.\r\nDeary me, they'll outlast us,\" and she sighed also.\r\n\r\nRoseann agreed. Six sheets and pillow-cases, three tablecloths and\r\nhalf-a-dozen towels, and two blankets, one spun and woven by their own\r\nmother. The initials and date were marked on them in old-fashioned\r\ncross-stitch, which was a little more ornate than regular\r\nsampler-stitch.\r\n\r\nAunt Hetty's blanket had been made from the wool of an especial cosset\r\nlamb that had lost its mother and been brought up by hand. The little\r\ngirl was very much interested.\r\n\r\n\"Did it follow her about?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Dear sakes!\" and Aunt Famie laughed. \"I just guess it did. It grew very\r\ntroublesome, I've heard tell, and was quite quality, always wanting to\r\ncome into the sitting-room. And it would curl down at Aunt Hetty's feet\r\nlike a dog. She saved the wool every year, and spun it, and laid it away\r\nuntil she had enough. But I don't believe it went to school, although\r\nit could spell one word.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word!\" cried the little girl, in amaze. \"What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why b-a ba, of course. They said it could spell through the whole\r\nlesson, and I don't see why not. I've heard lambs make a dozen different\r\nsounds.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl laughed. She was very fond of listening to what Aunt\r\nFamie did when she was little; and they went to call upon some curious\r\nold people who kept to the Dutch ways and wore the old costume. Some of\r\nthem had wooden clogs for rainy weather. When they talked real Dutch,\r\nHanny found it was quite different from German. They had a picture of\r\nsome old ancestor's house with the windmill in the front yard.\r\n\r\nThe drives about were beautiful then, and so many places had queer old\r\nlegends. Dr. Hoffman was very much interested, and it seemed to Hanny as\r\nif she had strayed over into Holland. She resolved when she went home to\r\nask Ben to get her a history of Holland, so she and her father might\r\nread it together. Her mother never had any time.\r\n\r\nMargaret was much surprised at her gifts, and thanked the cousins with\r\nwarmest gratitude. Even Grandmother Van Kortlandt had hinted \"that she\r\nwasn't going to save up everything for Haneran.\" But the elder people in\r\nthose days were fond of holding on to their possessions until the very\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nUncle David came up for them and took them to White Plains, where they\r\nhad a nice visit; and grandmother selected some articles from her store\r\nfor the prospective bride.\r\n\r\nHanny remembered what Cousin Archer had said about the mittens, and\r\nasked Uncle David. He found his hook, and, sure enough, it was something\r\nlike a crochet-needle. He took what the little girls called single\r\nstitch. But he admitted that Hanny's pretty edgings and tidies were\r\nquite wonderful.\r\n\r\n\"I thought the Germans must have brought the knowledge to the country,\"\r\nshe said. \"How long have you known it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, since my boyhood,\" and he gave a smile. \"I heard a very old man say\r\nonce that Noah set his sons to work in the Ark making fishing-nets.\r\nPerhaps Mrs. Noah set her daughter-in-laws to crocheting, as you call\r\nit. Forty days was a pretty long spell of rainy weather, when they had\r\nno books or papers to read, and couldn't go out to work in the garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't they have any books?\" Hanny's eyes opened wide.\r\n\r\n\"All their writing was done on stone tablets, and very little of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I wouldn't have liked living then. Books are so splendid. And\r\nyou get to know about so many people. But there was the Bible,\" and the\r\nchild's voice dropped to a reverent tone.\r\n\r\n\"Still, if Moses wrote the first books, that was a long while after the\r\nFlood.\"\r\n\r\nHanny's vague idea was that the Bible had been created in the beginning,\r\nlike Adam and Eve.\r\n\r\nCousin Ann and Aunt Eunice were as much in love with the little girl as\r\never, but were tremendously surprised at her stock of knowledge. It\r\ndidn't seem possible that one little girl could know so much. That she\r\ncould play tunes on the piano, and repeat ever so many French words,\r\nthen explain what they meant in English, was a marvel. But the child\r\nnever seemed spoiled by the admiration.\r\n\r\nThey had to come down to Yonkers, for Uncle Faid and Aunt Crete would\r\nhave been hurt and jealous. Only it did not seem now to Hanny as if she\r\nhad ever lived there. The old kitchen, the creek that went purling\r\nalong, bearing fleets of ducks and geese, and the wide old porch looked\r\nnatural, but the daily living was so changed! Old black Aunt Mary was\r\ndead. Some of the neighbours had gone away. Cousin Retty had a new baby,\r\na little girl; but she said it was the crossest thing alive, and it did\r\nseem to cry a good deal. It couldn't compare with Stephen's baby, who\r\nwas always laughing and jolly.\r\n\r\nThey had to stop at Fordham to see some cousins. When people live a\r\ncentury or so in one place and intermarry, they get related to a good\r\nmany people. And there was a sweet little grandmother here, who, in her\r\ngirlhood, had the same name as the little visitor--Hannah Underhill.\r\nThere was no Ann in it to be sure. And now her name was Hannah Horton.\r\n\r\nThere were lots of gay, rollicking cousins. The little girl felt almost\r\nafraid of the big boys, and she was used to boys, too.\r\n\r\nHer mother had said she might make a visit with the Odell girls. They\r\nhad grown and changed; and Hanny felt quite as if she were undersized.\r\nMr. Odell had been building a new part to the house; and oh, what a\r\nlovely garden they had! It made the little girl almost envious.\r\n\r\nMargaret left her there for several days. At least, Dr. Hoffman drove up\r\none afternoon and took Margaret home, as Hanny's visit wasn't near\r\nfinished. They had to talk about their schools and the girls they knew.\r\nPolly and Janey wanted to hear about the First Street girls and Daisy\r\nJasper, who was getting well, and Nora, who had moved away, and the\r\nquaint old ladies in Beach Street.\r\n\r\nThere was a splendid big cat at the Odell's who liked nothing better\r\nthan being nursed, and two kittens that Hanny never tired of watching,\r\nthey were so utterly funny in their antics, and seemed to do so much\r\nactual reasoning, as to cause and effect, that it amazed her. And, oh,\r\nthe beautiful country ways and wild flowers on every hand!\r\n\r\nIt does not look so now. One wonders where all the people have come from\r\nto fill the rows and rows of houses, and to keep busy about the mills\r\nand factories. But then the great city had only about five hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants, and did not need to overflow into suburban\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nIt seemed strange for the little girl to come home to a city street. It\r\nlooked narrow and bare, with its cobblestones and paved sidewalks. And,\r\noh, what a racket the waggons made! and she was amazed at the crowds of\r\npeople, as she thought there were then.\r\n\r\nBut inside everything was homelike and delightful. She was so glad to\r\nsee her mother and father and the boys. Ben looked like a young man. Jim\r\nwas to go to a preparatory school for a year, and then enter Columbia\r\nCollege. Mrs. Craven had sold her house, and gone up to Seventh Street,\r\nand was to have quite a young ladies' school. Josie Dean had decided to\r\nstudy for a teacher. That made her seem quite grown up.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Beekman had died while the little girl was away; and Katschina\r\nhad grieved herself to death, and followed her master. Annette had a\r\nlover, but of course she could not marry in some time. The old farm was\r\nto be sold--at least, streets were to be cut through it, and the\r\noutlying lots sold off. Mrs. Beekman was to keep the down-town house for\r\nher part.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was considered that Stephen Underhill had done a grand thing\r\nfor himself in marrying Dolly Beekman. Mr. Beekman owned no end of real\r\nestate, was indeed much richer than people imagined. The girls would\r\neach have a big slice. But Dolly was just as sweet and plain, and as\r\nmuch interested in everybody as before. She was so ready to help and\r\nadvise Margaret, and go out shopping with her. For was she not very\r\nwise and experienced, having been married two whole years!\r\n\r\nDr. Hoffman had bought his house up-town as well. Some people scouted\r\nthe idea that the city could be crowded even in fifty years. But the\r\nlong-headed ones reasoned that it must go up, as it could not expand in\r\nbreadth, and \"down-town\" must be given over to business.\r\n\r\nHanny went up to see the new house one Saturday. The front basement was\r\nto be the office, and was being fitted up with some shelves and\r\ncabinets. The back basement was the kitchen. There were two large\r\nparlors and a third room, that was the dining-room. And one thing\r\ninterested the little girl greatly,--this was the \"dumb waiter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it can't talk,\" said she, laughingly. \"And it can't hear; but\r\nyou can make it obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"It can creak and groan when it gets dry for a little oil. And it will\r\nbe like a camel if you put too heavy a load on it,\" returned the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Does the camel groan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Horribly! And he won't stir an inch toward getting up until you lighten\r\nhis load.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pretty pantry across the corner, with a basin to wash china\r\nand silver, so it would not need to go downstairs. Hanny thought she\r\nwould like to come sometime and wash the pretty dishes.\r\n\r\nUpstairs there were three rooms and a bath, and beautiful closets, and\r\non the third floor three rooms again.\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do with all of them?\" asked Hanny.\r\n\r\nMargaret had said the same thing to her lover. And Mrs. Underhill said\r\nit was an awful extravagance to have such a great house for two people.\r\nBut John Underhill declared Dr. Hoffman had done just the right thing,\r\nbuying up-town. He would settle himself in a first-class practice\r\npresently, as the well-to-do people kept moving thither.\r\n\r\nThere had been a good deal of discussion about the wedding. Dr. Hoffman\r\nwanted to take Margaret to Baltimore, where his married sister resided,\r\nand an aunt, his mother's sister, who was too feeble to undertake a\r\njourney. They would go on to Washington as well. Wedding journeys were\r\nnot imperative, but often taken. An evening party at home seemed too\r\nmuch for Mrs. Underhill; and Dolly, being in mourning, could not lead\r\nany gaieties.\r\n\r\nShe cut the Gordian knot, however,--a church wedding, with cards for all\r\nthe friends, and a reception at home. They would take the train at six\r\nfrom Jersey City. Mr. Underhill was rather sorry not to have an\r\nold-fashioned festivity. But Miss Cynthia said this was just the thing.\r\n\r\nSo the marriage was at St. Thomas' church at two o'clock. A cousin of\r\nDolly's and a school friend were bridesmaids, though Annette Beekman had\r\nbeen chosen. The bride wore a fine India mull that flowed around her\r\nlike a fleecy cloud, Dolly's veil, and orange blossoms, for it was good\r\nluck to be married in something borrowed. The little girl headed the\r\nprocession, carrying a basket of flowers, and looked daintily sweet.\r\n\r\nThe \"Home Journal,\" the society paper of that day, spoke of the\r\nbeautiful young couple in quite extravagant terms. Mrs. Underhill said\r\nrather tartly afterward, \"That Margaret was well enough looking; but she\r\nhad never thought of setting her up for a beauty.\" Yet down in the\r\ndepths of her heart her mother love had a little ache because her last\r\nborn would never be as beautiful. But Mr. Underhill considered they had\r\nnot been praised a bit too much, and sent in a year's subscription to\r\nthe paper.\r\n\r\nMiss Cynthia was in her glory. She seemed one of the people who never\r\ngrow old, and though a great talker, was seldom sharp or severe.\r\nEverybody knew she could get married if she desired to, so she rather\r\ngloried in staying single.\r\n\r\nMargaret cut her wedding-cake, and the piece with the ring fell to\r\nDolly's cousin, who turned scarlet, which brought out a general laugh.\r\nThere was much wishing of joy, and presently Margaret went upstairs and\r\nput on her pretty grey silk with the \"drawn\" bonnet to match, and the\r\ngrey cloth _visite_, looking as handsome as she had in her wedding gown.\r\n\r\nThey left so many people behind no one had a chance to feel lonesome.\r\nThere were ever so many relations who were going to stay for a visit,\r\nand shop a little. People were given to hospitality in those days. The\r\nconstricted living of flats had not come into existence. And your friend\r\nwould have felt insulted to be taken to a restaurant for dinner, instead\r\nof at your own house.\r\n\r\nHanny had quite a girls' tea-party afterward. Martha spread a table for\r\nthem upstairs. And the funny thing was, that her father and the boys\r\nteased to come, and her mother really had to rush to the rescue. But\r\nthey did let Doctor Joe remain, and they had a delightful time.\r\n\r\nJosie and Tudie and Nora told how they would do when they were married.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Hanny!\" Daisy Jasper had not spoken. It was not likely any one\r\nwould want to marry a lame girl, and the others were too kind to make it\r\na matter of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe I _can_ get married,\" said Hanny, with sweet\r\nseriousness. \"I shouldn't like to leave father, and mother will want\r\nsomebody, for the boys will be away.\"\r\n\r\nDaisy stretched out her hand. \"We'll just have a good time together,\"\r\nshe rejoined, smilingly. \"And if Doctor Joe doesn't get married, we'll\r\nwork slippers for him and cigar cases, and if we could learn how, we\r\nmight make him a dressing-gown.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will be as good as that, I don't think I will get married. And\r\nwhen I drop in, you can give me a cup of tea, and we'll have the best of\r\ntimes. I hope I won't be very queer.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it so seriously, they all laughed.\r\n\r\nAfterward he declared he was going to take all the girls home. That was\r\na bachelor's prerogative, and he would begin at once. He took the Deans\r\nfirst, then Nora, whom he put in the Bowery stage. Daisy and Hanny spent\r\nthat leisure admiring baby Stephen, who had six cunning white teeth and\r\ncurly hair, which the little girl doted on.\r\n\r\nDaisy told the tea-party over to her aunt and her mother, and was very\r\nhappy. And she felt someway as if she had settled her life, and\r\nshouldn't mind it very much. But husbands who were as tender as Dr.\r\nHoffman, and babies like laughing, dimpled Stevie!\r\n\r\nWere there some childish tears in her eyes? But the main thing for her\r\nwas to get strong and be courageous, and take her share of the world's\r\nknowledges and beautiful things. She wondered sometimes why the Lord\r\nJesus, who was so wise and good and pitiful, should have let this\r\nmisfortune come upon her, or why, when all the doctors were so in\r\nearnest, they could not have made her straight and well. And when people\r\nsaid, \"Oh, what a pity, with that lovely face!\" she thought she could\r\nhave borne it better if she had been plainer.\r\n\r\nWhen the great love that thinks for its neighbour imbues us all, we\r\nshall cease to make personal comments, and endeavour to bear each others\r\nburdens with silent, tender grace.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe was her comfort and inspiration. No one could ever estimate\r\nwhat his kindly interest had done for her. He was so cheerful and full\r\nof fun and sunshine. Elderly women had begun to pet up the young doctor,\r\nin spite of his youth.\r\n\r\nIn fact there were many virtues ascribed to experience in those days;\r\nand now we have learned the truth is in the application, that living\r\nthrough a great deal doesn't always bring wisdom.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Van Kortlandt and Aunt Katrina had a fine time visiting\r\nStephen. They were quite stylish, old-fashioned style, that wore fine\r\nEnglish thread-laces with the scent of lavender, and had their silvery\r\nhair done up in puffs with side-combs. They were a little precise and\r\nformal, and would have been horrified if the children had not said \"Yes,\r\nma'am,\" and \"No, ma'am.\" No free and easy manners for them!\r\n\r\nThe little girl was quite sure she loved Grandmother Underhill the best.\r\nBoth called her Haneran, as if they were a little jealous of a full\r\nshare in her name. Grandmother made quite a long visit, for she said,\r\n\"She might never come again, she was getting rather feeble. She didn't\r\nexpect to live to see the little girl married.\"\r\n\r\nHanny's father declared, \"She couldn't be married until she was\r\ntwenty-five, just in time to save her from being an old maid.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I won't be very old at twenty-five,\" she replied, smiling out of\r\nher big innocent eyes. \"And I thought I wouldn't get married at all.\"\r\n\r\nThey _did_ miss Margaret. But the little girl had to study hard, and\r\nwait on her mother, and practise her music, and visit. There were so\r\nmany places clamouring for her.\r\n\r\nThe boys at Houston Street missed Jim Underhill also, though he often\r\ncame up that way when he could get off, which meant when he did not have\r\nto stay for a recitation. Though they were up to pranks, they were not\r\ncruel or malicious. If they could \"make fun,\" and rhyme a fellow's name\r\nridiculously, and ring door-bells now and then, or leave a nicely\r\ndone-up parcel on some one's stoop, wrapped and tied and directed,\r\ncontaining a box of ashes, or a brick, they were satisfied. They still\r\nconsidered it fun to have Biddy Brady dance, and Limpy Dick, as they\r\ncalled the lame girl, run a race. She hopped along with her hand on her\r\nlame knee with surprising rapidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWINTER HAPPENINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nMargaret came home and had a party at her house, \"Infair\" the older\r\npeople called it. Then a family tea at home, and another at Stephen's.\r\nMrs. Verplank, the Doctor's half-sister, gave her a very elegant\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nShe was oddly changed, somehow, just as sweet, but with more dignity and\r\ncomposure; and Jim couldn't make her turn red by teasing her. The little\r\ngirl noticed that her mother treated Margaret with a peculiar deference\r\nand never scolded her; and she said Philip to Dr. Hoffman.\r\n\r\nHe had some serious talks with the little girl, for he pretended to be\r\nafraid she would love Dolly and Stephen the best. Everybody had a desire\r\nto hold her, because she was so little and light. She was not to make\r\nthe baby an excuse to go the oftenest to Dolly's.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" she rejoined, with a sigh, \"and if John should get married,\r\nand the rest of them, as they grow up, I wouldn't have any time left for\r\nmyself. But Joe isn't going to be married.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Hoffman laughed at that.\r\n\r\nJohn had a sweetheart. He always dressed up in his best on Wednesday\r\nnight. Young men in those days thought of homes and families of their\r\nown. There were no clubs to take them in.\r\n\r\nAn odd little incident happened to Margaret's _menage_. Stephen had one\r\nof Aunt Mary's grandsons as porter in the store. Another, who had been\r\nbrought up as a sort of house-servant to some elderly people that death\r\nhad visited, came to the city, and Stephen sent him to Dr. Hoffman, who\r\nwas inquiring about a factotum. He was a very well-looking and\r\nwell-mannered young coloured lad, and knew how to drive and care for a\r\nhorse. He was quite a cook also, and soon learned to do the marketing.\r\n\r\nMargaret kept house for herself, and enjoyed her pretty new china and\r\nbeautiful cut-glass. And after a month or two Dolly persuaded her to\r\nrent two rooms to two ladies, the back room on the second floor, and one\r\non the third. She was glad to have some company when the Doctor had to\r\nbe out. One of the ladies coloured plates for magazines and illustrated\r\nbooks. This was done by hand then, and was considered quite artistic\r\nwork. We had not printed in colours yet. The ladies were very refined,\r\nand had a small income beside the work.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor took Margaret out every pleasant afternoon. His practice was\r\nnot large enough to work him very severely. In the evening they read or\r\nsang, as she played very nicely now. But she missed the breezy boys and\r\ntheir doings, and her mother's cheery voice ordering every one about,\r\nand, oh, she missed the little girl who didn't come half often enough.\r\n\r\nShe began a choice piece of work for her, a silk quilt. No one had gone\r\ninsane over crazy work then. This was shapely, decorous diamonds, with\r\nthe name of the wearer, or a date, embroidered on each block. The\r\nMorgans had given her pieces from Paris and Venice and Holland, and even\r\nHong Kong. Some were a hundred and more years old, and were gowns of\r\nquite famous people.\r\n\r\nThis fall the American Institute Fair was held at Niblo's Garden. There\r\nwere many curious things. Both telegraphs had been put up,--House's with\r\nits letter printing, Morse's with its cabalistic signs. How words could\r\ntravel through a bit of wire puzzled most people. Uncle Faid went with\r\nthem one afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"No use to tell me,\" he declared. \"The fellow at one end knows just what\r\nthe fellow at the other end is going to say. Now if they sent it in a\r\nbox, or a letter, it would look reasonable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send you a message,\" said Ben; \"you go down at the end, and see if\r\nthis doesn't come to you.\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote on a slip of paper, and gave it to Uncle Faid, who went to the\r\nother end with a disbelieving shake of the head. And when the receiver\r\nwrote it out, and Uncle Faid compared it, the astonishment was\r\nindescribable.\r\n\r\n\"There's some jugglery about it,\" he still insisted. \"Stands to reason a\r\nbit of wire can't really know what you say.\"\r\n\r\nHanny brought home her telegraph message; and when she showed it to Nora\r\nWhitney, the child declared it was like the queer things in some books\r\nher papa had, called hieroglyphics. But Doctor Joe told her a stranger\r\nthing than that. He found the verses in the Psalms that were supposed to\r\nprefigure the telegraph:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.\r\n\r\n     \"Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to\r\n     the end of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they can't go across the ocean,\" said the little girl, confidently.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are discussing the feasibility of crossing the Hudson with\r\nsome kind of sunken cable. What we shall be doing fifty years from\r\nnow--and I shall not be such a dreadfully old man! We are learning how\r\nto live longer as well.\"\r\n\r\nFifty years! and she would be as old as the grandmothers!\r\n\r\nThe other wonderful thing was the sewing-machine. Elias Howe had learned\r\nhow to thread the needle, the opposite way, by putting the eye in the\r\npoint. There was a little bent piece underneath that caught the loop\r\nwhile a thread ran through it. They gave away samples, and everybody\r\nadmitted that it _was_ wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe little girl said she could sew a great deal better. And her mother\r\ndeclared such sewing was hardly good enough for a feed-bag. Her father\r\nlaughed, and told her rosy fingers were good enough sewing-machine for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nArtificial legs and feet interested Doctor Joe very much. They had\r\ncurious springs and wires, and the outside was pink, like real\r\nflesh,--in fact, they looked uncanny, they were so real. Hanny had seen\r\nseveral old men stumping around on cork or wooden legs about which there\r\ncould be no deception. But when any one met with a mishap now, they\r\ncould fix him up \"limber as an eel,\" Doctor Joe said.\r\n\r\nThere was a deal of curious machinery and implements that some people\r\nsmiled over, which, like the sewing-machines, made fortunes for their\r\ninventors presently; beautiful articles and jewelry; a great vegetable\r\nand flower exhibit; a small loom; weaving; carving of all kinds; and\r\ncloths and silks. Indeed, the Fair was considered a very great thing,\r\nand the country people who came in to visit it felt almost as if they\r\nhad been to a strange country. Every afternoon and evening it was\r\ncrowded.\r\n\r\nJim liked his new school very much, and soon flung his Latin words at\r\nhis little sister in perfect broadsides. Then he found that Ben had\r\nsomehow picked up a good deal of Latin, and knew all the Greek alphabet;\r\nand instead of laughing at Charles Reed, as a Miss Nancy, he became\r\nquite friendly with him.\r\n\r\nAll the children came home for a Christmas dinner, and had a delightful\r\ntime. Then Martha was married, and went to her own housekeeping, and a\r\ncousin of the little German girls who lived in Houston Street, who had\r\njust come from Germany, petitioned for a trial. She was so bright and\r\nclean and ambitious to learn American ways that after a fortnight, Mrs.\r\nUnderhill decided to keep her.\r\n\r\nWhen all the visitors had gone, Hanny found it very lonely sleeping in a\r\nbig room by herself. And as they couldn't move her downstairs, Mr. and\r\nMrs. Underhill went upstairs and changed their room to the\r\nguest-chamber. Hanny missed her sister very much when night came. But\r\nthen she had so many lessons to study; and after the history of Holland,\r\nthey took up that of Spain, which was as fascinating as any romance.\r\n\r\nEverybody was a good deal excited this winter about a curious\r\nphenomenon. At a small town in Western New York two sisters had\r\nannounced that they could hold communication with the spirit-world, and\r\nreceive messages from the dead. Little raps announced the spirit of your\r\nfriend or relative. To imaginative people, it was simply wonderful. And\r\nnow the Misses Fox were giving exhibitions and making converts.\r\n\r\nPeople recalled the old Salem witchcraft, and not a few considered it\r\ndirect dealing with the Evil One. Ben was deeply interested. He and Joe\r\ntalked over clairvoyance and mesmerism,--a curious power developed by a\r\nlearned German, Dr. Mesmer, akin to that of some of the old magicians.\r\nBen was very fond of abnormal things; but Joe set down communication\r\nwith another world as an impossibility. Still, a good many people\r\nbelieved it.\r\n\r\nThe children joined the singing-school again, and Charles Reed sang at\r\nseveral concerts. He went quite often to the Deans, and occasionally\r\ncame over to the Underhills. Both houses were so delightful! If he only\r\nhad a sister, or a brother! Or if his mother would do something beside\r\nscrub and clean the house! Social life was so attractive to him.\r\n\r\nOne day she did do something else. It was February, and the snow and ice\r\nhad melted rapidly. All the air was full of the sort of chill that goes\r\nthrough one. She wanted some windows washed, and the yard cleared up,\r\nand was out in the damp a long while. That night she was seized with a\r\nsudden attack of pleurisy. Mr. Reed sprang up and made a mustard\r\ndraught; but the pain grew so severe that he called Charles, and sent\r\nhim over for Doctor Joe. By daylight, fever set in, and it was so severe\r\na case that Doctor Joe called a more experienced doctor in consultation,\r\nand said they must have a nurse at once.\r\n\r\nCharles had never seen her ill before. And when the doctors looked so\r\ngrave, and the nurse spoke in such low tones, he was certain she could\r\nnot live. He was so nervous that he could not get his lessons, and\r\nroamed about the house in a frightened sort of way. The nurse was used\r\nto housekeeping as well, and when she was needed downstairs Charles\r\nstayed in the sick-room. His mother did not know him or any one, but\r\nwandered in her mind, and was haunted by the ghosts of work in a manner\r\nthat was pitiful to listen to. The nurse said she had made work her\r\nidol. There were two days when Mr. Reed stayed at home, though he sent\r\nCharles off to school. They had a woman in the kitchen now, a relative\r\nhe had written for, Cousin Jane that Charles had once met in the\r\ncountry. She was extremely tidy; but she put on an afternoon gown, and a\r\nwhite apron, and found time in the evening to read the paper.\r\n\r\nOn the second afternoon both doctors went away just as Charles came\r\nhome. His father was standing on the stoop with them, and Doctor Joe\r\nlooked down and smiled. The boy's heart beat with a sudden warmth, as he\r\nwent down the area steps, wiped his feet, and hung up his cap and\r\novercoat with as much care as if his mother's sharp eyes were on him.\r\nThere was no one in the room; but he sat down at once to his lessons.\r\n\r\nPresently his father entered. His eyes had a pathetic look, as if they\r\nwere flooded with tears.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor gives us a little hope, Charles,\" he said, in a rather\r\ntremulous voice. \"It's been a hard pull. The fever was broken yesterday;\r\nbut she was so awful weak; indeed, it seemed two or three times in the\r\nnight as if she was quite gone. Since noon there has been a decided\r\nchange; and, if nothing new happens, she will come around all right. It\r\nwill be a long while though. She's worked too hard and steady; but it\r\nhas not been my fault. At all events, we'll keep Cousin Jane just as\r\nlong as we can. And now I must run down-town for a few hours. Tell\r\nCousin Jane not to keep tea waiting.\"\r\n\r\nCharles sat in deep thought many minutes. His father's unwonted emotion\r\nhad touched him keenly. Of course he would have been very sorry to have\r\nhis mother die, yet how often he had wished for another mother. The\r\nthought shocked him now; and yet he could see so many places where it\r\nwould be delightful to have her different. Careful as she was of him, he\r\nhad no inner consciousness that she loved him, and he did so want to\r\nhave some one he could love and caress, and who would make herself\r\npretty. Hanny loved her father and mother so much. She \"hung around\"\r\nthem. She sat in her father's lap and threaded his hair with her soft\r\nlittle fingers. She had such pretty ways with her mother. She didn't\r\nseem ever to feel afraid.\r\n\r\nNeither did the Deans. Of course they were all girls; but there were Ben\r\nand Jim and, oh, Doctor Joe teased his mother, and was sweet to her, and\r\neven kissed her, grown man that he was!\r\n\r\nCharles could hardly decide which mother he liked the most, but he\r\nthought Mrs. Dean. Mrs. Underhill sometimes scolded, though it never\r\nseemed real earnest.\r\n\r\nHe felt more at home with the Deans. Perhaps this was because Mrs. Dean\r\nhad always coveted a boy, and, like a good many mothers, she wanted a\r\nreal nice, smart, refined boy. Charles was obedient and truthful, neat\r\nand orderly, and always had his lessons \"by heart.\" He was very proud\r\nof his standing in school. He could talk lessons over with more freedom\r\nto Mr. Dean than with his own father. And Josie was always so proud of\r\nhim. Perhaps the reason he liked the Deans so well was because he was\r\nsuch a favourite with them, and appreciation seemed very sweet to the\r\nboy who had so little in his life.\r\n\r\nMr. Dean seemed to think there was great danger of his growing up a\r\nprig; but Mrs. Dean always took his part in any discussion. Mr. Dean was\r\nvery fond of having him over to sing; and Josie gave him her piano\r\nlessons, only she kept a long way ahead.\r\n\r\nOh, how many, many times Charles had wished he was their son! There were\r\nso many boys in the Underhill family, he was quite sure they couldn't\r\nwant any more.\r\n\r\nBut just now he felt curiously conscience-stricken, though greatly\r\nconfused. He supposed his mother _did_ want him, though she always\r\nconsidered him so much trouble, and talked about her \"working from\r\nmorning to night and getting no thanks for it.\" He had felt he would\r\nlike to thank her specially for some things, but ought he, _must_ he, be\r\ngrateful for the things he did not want and were only a trouble and\r\nmortification to him? And was it wicked to wish for some other mother?\r\n\r\nHe would try not to do it again. He might think of Mrs. Dean as his\r\naunt, and the girls his cousins. And he would endeavour with all his\r\nmight to love his own mother.\r\n\r\nYears afterward, he came to know how great an influence this hour had on\r\nhim in moulding his character. But he did not realise how long he had\r\ndreamed until he heard Cousin Jane's brisk voice,--it was not a cross or\r\ncomplaining voice,--saying:--\r\n\r\n\"Why, Charles, here in the dark! Well, we have had a pretty severe time;\r\nbut your mother's good constitution has pulled her through. And that\r\nyoung doctor's just splendid! I haven't had much opinion of young\r\ndoctors heretofore. To be sure, there has been Dr. Fitch; but I think\r\nDr. Underhill works more as if his life depended on it. And if you\r\nweren't very hungry, Charles, we might wait until your father comes\r\nhome. About seven, he said. I must confess that Cousin Maria has one of\r\nthe best and most faithful of husbands. He isn't sparing any expense,\r\neither.\"\r\n\r\nCharles flushed with delight to hear his father praised for his devotion\r\nto his mother.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to wait, Cousin Jane,\" he replied in an eager tone.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make a cup of tea and take a bit of bread and cold meat up to Mrs.\r\nBond. Then I'll come back and set the table.\"\r\n\r\nShe had lighted the lamps while she was talking, and Charles hurried up\r\nwith his neglected lessons, studying in earnest.\r\n\r\nIt was half-past seven when his father came in. No one fretted, however.\r\nHis brisk walk had given him a good colour, and his eyes had brightened.\r\nHe seemed so pleased that they had waited for him. Cousin Jane did make\r\nevents go on smoothly. The tea was hot, as he liked it; and there was a\r\nplate of toast, of which he was very fond.\r\n\r\nWhen he took out his paper, he said to Charles:--\r\n\r\n\"You might run over to the Deans and tell them the good news. They have\r\nbeen so kind about inquiring. I wouldn't stay more than ten or fifteen\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nHe had not been over in a week, and they were glad to see him, as well\r\nas to hear the hopeful tidings. But the girls had quite a bit of\r\ncasuistry in their talk that night as they were going to bed, partly as\r\nto how Charles could be so glad, and partly whether one ought to be glad\r\nunder all circumstances, when events happened that did not really tend\r\nto one's comfort.\r\n\r\n\"But Mary Dawson said she wasn't sorry when her stepmother died, and she\r\nwouldn't tell a story about it. Her stepmother wasn't much crosser than\r\nMrs. Reed. You know Mrs. Dawson wouldn't let the girls go to\r\nsinging-school, and she made them wear their outgrown dresses, and she\r\ndid whip them dreadfully. I couldn't have been sorry either.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it would be awful not to have any one sorry when you were dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" began Josie, gravely, \"we ought to act so people _will_ be\r\nsorry. If you are good and kind, and do things pleasantly--Mrs. Reed is\r\nalways doing; but I guess it is a good deal the _way_ you do. You see\r\nmother and father do think of the things we like, when they are right\r\nand proper. They show they love us and like to have us love them in\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I just couldn't live without mother!\" and the tears overflowed\r\nTudie's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"And I know it would break her heart, and father's, too, if they lost\r\nus. And so we ought to try and make each other happy. I mean to think\r\nmore about it. And, oh, Tudie, if Mrs. Reed could be converted! People\r\nare sometimes when they've been very ill. Suppose we pray for that.\"\r\n\r\nThey did heartily; and Josie resolved not to miss one night. It would\r\nmake bonny Prince Charlie so happy to have his mother changed into a\r\nsweet, tender woman.\r\n\r\nCharles didn't dare pray for that. God knew what was best for any one,\r\nand He _did_ have the power. He wondered what things were right to put\r\nin one's prayers. Some years after he came to know it was \"all things,\"\r\njust as one might ask of a human father, knowing that sometimes even the\r\nfather after the flesh, in his larger wisdom, saw that it was best to\r\ndeny.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to look in on your mother?\" Cousin Jane said the next\r\nmorning. He had not seen her in several days.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" answered Charles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed had been thin before; but now she looked ghostly, with her\r\nsunken eyes and sharpened nose and chin. Charles had a great desire to\r\nkiss her; but she did not approve of such \"foolishness.\" Her poor\r\nskeleton hand, that had done so much hard and useless work, lay on the\r\nspread in a limp fashion, as if it would never do anything again.\r\n\r\nCharles took it up and pressed it to his cheek. Mrs. Reed opened her\r\neyes, and a wavering light, hardly a smile, crossed her face.\r\n\r\n\"I've been very sick,\" and, oh, how faint the sound was, quivering, too,\r\nas if it had not the strength to steady itself! And then the thin lids\r\nfell. The death-like pallor startled him.\r\n\r\n\"But you're going to get well again.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy's sweet, confident tone touched her. She did not dare open her\r\neyes, lest she should cry, she was so weak. Then he said,\r\n\"Good-morning,\" and went softly out of the room, feeling that he was\r\nglad in every pulse of his being that God had given her back to them.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe had a good deal of credit for the case. Dr. Fitch admitted\r\nthat it had been very severe, and required the utmost watchfulness. Mrs.\r\nUnderhill was very proud of her son's success \"in his own country,\" as\r\nshe termed it. And she said when Mrs. Reed was well enough to see\r\nvisitors, she would go over and call. Indeed, it had created a good deal\r\nof interest in the neighbourhood, and Charles found himself treated with\r\na peculiar deference among the children.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed's recovery was very slow, however. Mrs. Bond went away when\r\nshe could begin to go about the room and help herself. Cousin Jane was a\r\ngood nurse, and she declared, \"There wasn't work enough to keep her\r\nhalf busy.\" She did the mending and the ironing; Mr. Reed insisted they\r\nshould have a washerwoman. Mrs. Reed sighed when she thought of the\r\nexpense. It had been the pride of her life that she never had a fit of\r\nillness, and had never hired a day's work done except when Charles was\r\nborn.\r\n\r\nShe was sure now that the house must be in an awful plight. She never\r\nfound time to sit down in the morning and read a book or paper. Cousin\r\nJane changed her gown every afternoon, and wore lace ruffles at the\r\nneck, just plain strips of what was called footing, that she pleated up\r\nherself. Then, too, she wore white muslin aprons,--a very old fashion\r\nthat was coming back. And though Mrs. Reed couldn't find fault when she\r\nsaw Charles and his father always as neat as a pin, still she was sure\r\nthere must be a great need of thoroughness somewhere. She prided herself\r\nupon being \"thorough.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill came over one day with the Doctor, and they had a really\r\nnice call. Of course Mrs. Reed couldn't understand how she ever managed\r\nwith such a houseful of boys. Yet she was fresh and fair, and seemed to\r\ntake life very comfortably. Then they were always having so much company\r\nat the Underhills.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Underhill, with a mellow sort of laugh that agreed\r\ncapitally with her ample person,--\"yes, we have such a host of\r\ncousins,--not all own ones, but second and third. And since my daughter\r\nwas married, the house seems lonesome at times. All the boys are away\r\nat work but Jim; and Hanny has so many places to go, that, what with\r\nlessons and all, I don't seem to get much good of her. But I've a nice\r\nkitchen-girl. She was a great trial when she first came, with her not\r\nknowing much English, and her German ways of cooking. But she's quite\r\nlike folks now, and very trusty. How fortunate you found a relative to\r\ncome in and do for you! And the Doctor says you must give up hard work\r\nfor a long while to come.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed sighed, and said she should be glad enough to get about again.\r\n\r\nThe Deans came over, and some of the other neighbours; and Mrs. Reed\r\nfound it very pleasant. One afternoon late in March, Mr. Reed came home\r\nquite early, and carried his wife down into the dining-room. He had\r\nasked the Deans over to tea, and Doctor Joe. And there was the table,\r\nspick and span, the silver shining, the windows so clean you couldn't\r\nsee there was any glass in them, the curtains fresh, the tablecloth\r\nironed so that every flower and leaf in it stood out. There wasn't a\r\nspeck of dust anywhere!\r\n\r\nThe kitchen was in nice order; the range black and speckless, the\r\nclosets sweet with their fresh white paper. And Cousin Jane's bread and\r\nbiscuit were as good as anybody's, her ham tender and a luscious pink,\r\nher two kinds of cake perfection.\r\n\r\nCharles sat next to his mother, a tall, smiling boy with a clean collar\r\nand his best roundabout. It was the first tea-party he ever remembered,\r\nand he was delighted. He was so polite and watchful of his mother that\r\nit really went to her heart.\r\n\r\nFor seven weeks the house had gone on without her, and she couldn't see\r\nany change for the worse. Mr. Reed looked uncommonly well, and was a\r\nvery agreeable host. The Doctor complimented her, and said next week he\r\nshould come and take her out driving; and that, to do him real credit,\r\nshe must get some flesh on her bones.\r\n\r\nIt was a very pleasant time; and Charles was so happy that his mother\r\nwondered if there wasn't something better in the world than work and\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE LAND OF OPHIR\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring came on apace, and spring in New York had many beautiful features\r\nthen. The Battery, the Bowling Green, City Hall Park, with its fountain,\r\nthe College grounds, Trinity and St. Paul's churchyards, and the squares\r\ncoming into existence farther up-town. Trees and grass and flowers\r\ndelighted the eye, and lilacs made the air fragrant. All up the country\r\nways there were patches of wild honeysuckle,--pinxter flowers, as it was\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nThe little girl had so many things to distract her attention that she\r\nwondered how grown-up people could be so tranquil with all their\r\nknowledges and their cares. She began to realise the great difference in\r\ntastes and characteristics, though she would not have quite comprehended\r\nthat long word. Perhaps Ben, being in the midst of stories and books,\r\nand hearing so much talk about the great men of the day, roused the same\r\ntrain of thought in her, though I think hero-worship came natural to\r\nher. The Dean girls read the sweet pretty domestic stories with great\r\nrelish. Miss Macintosh, Mary Howitt, and even Jane Austin were their\r\ndelight. Hanny and Daisy were deeply interested in history. And during\r\nthe last year some very spirited stories had been written on the Mexican\r\nwar, and all the struggles of a few years before. The wealth and\r\nsplendour of Montezuma and his sad ending, the wonders of that land of\r\nancient romance, were rendered more real on account of the present\r\nstruggle that Hanny and her father had followed closely. She kept in\r\ntouch with all the generals. The hero of Monterey, General Worth,\r\nGeneral Scott's entry into the city of Montezuma, General Watts Kearny,\r\nwho led his men a thousand miles through the desert to seize Santa Fé,\r\nand hold New Mexico, and his brilliant young nephew, Philip, who was the\r\nfirst man to enter the gate of San Antonio, and who lost his left arm at\r\nthe battle of Churubusco. Little did she dream, indeed, who could have\r\ndreamed then, that he was to be one of the heroes of another war, nearer\r\nand more dreadful to us!\r\n\r\nThen there was a great celebration over the final victory. City Hall was\r\ncrowded. There were some magnificent fireworks and much rejoicing. And\r\nthough there were questions for diplomacy to adjust, we had gained\r\nCalifornia and New Mexico; and both were destined to have a great\r\nbearing on the future of the country.\r\n\r\nWhen Hanny could spare time from this exciting topic and her lessons,\r\nthere was little Stevie, who was the sweetest and most cunning baby\r\nalive, she was quite sure. He could run all over, and say ever so many\r\nwords. The hard ones he had to shorten, so he called the little girl\r\nNan, and Dolly and Stephen caught it up as well. When they came over to\r\nFirst Street, the neighbourhood paid him the highest honours. All the\r\nchildren wanted to see him, and walk up and down with him. He was so\r\nmerry, laughing at the least little thing, and chattering away in his\r\nbaby language, with a few words now and then in good English. And, oh,\r\ndelight! his hair curled all over his head, and had a golden gleam to\r\nit. Certainly, as a baby, he was a tremendous success.\r\n\r\nBut the crowning point of this May was Hanny's birthday party. She was\r\ntwelve years old. Dolly and Margaret came down to spend the day and\r\nhelp. Oddly enough, Hanny knew very few boys. First, she thought she\r\nwould only have a girls' party. But there was Charlie, and some of her\r\nschoolmates had brothers; and Jim said he knew two splendid boys in\r\nschool that he would like to ask; and when they counted them up, they\r\nfound there were plenty enough.\r\n\r\nThey played games, of course,--pretty laughable things that had not gone\r\nout of fashion. And the supper-table was a feast to the eye as well as\r\nto the appetite. Toward the last, there were mottoes, and they had a\r\ngood deal of fun in exchanging. Doctor Joe was as merry as any boy, in\r\nfact, he laid himself out, as people say, to make the party a success,\r\nfor Hanny would have been a timid little hostess. Dolly and Margaret\r\nwere not much behind.\r\n\r\nAfter they went upstairs some one proposed the Virginia Reel. The older\r\nones were not long in taking their places.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said Doctor Joe to Daisy Jasper. \"It's very easy. You will have\r\nto learn some time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will I surely have to?\" and she gave an arch little smile.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You are to learn all the things girls do, even if you can draw\r\nportraits, which every girl can't do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" when she saw that he was in earnest; \"I am afraid. And then,\r\nI--\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not to be afraid.\" He put his arm about her and gently drew her\r\nout. \"You are to be my partner.\"\r\n\r\nHanny stood second in the row, looking so bright and eager that she was\r\nabsolutely pretty. And Jim's chum, the handsomest lad in the room, had\r\nchosen her. When she saw Daisy, she wanted to run down and kiss her, she\r\nwas so delighted.\r\n\r\nWhat with braces, and several appliances, Daisy now had only one\r\nshoulder that was a little high; and as she had grown stronger, she\r\ncould get about without much of a limp. She was quite tall for her age,\r\nand every gesture and motion was very graceful, in spite of the\r\nmisfortune. She sometimes danced at school.\r\n\r\nDolly struck up some merry music, and Stephen called off. How prettily\r\nthey balanced and turned, and joined hands left and right, and marched\r\ndown and up again, and then the first couple chasséd down the middle!\r\nWhen it was Hanny's turn, she came down looking like a fairy, and smiled\r\nover to her friend.\r\n\r\nDaisy was a good deal frightened at first, and would have run away but\r\nfor Doctor Joe's encouraging eyes. However, when her turn came, she did\r\nvery well. By this time they were all so intent upon their own pleasure\r\nno one really noticed her. Oh, how jolly it was!\r\n\r\nAfter that some of the children tried the three-step polka, and found it\r\nvery fascinating. A little after ten, the plates of cream came in, and\r\nat half-past, they began to disperse.\r\n\r\nStevie was asleep upstairs on Nan's bed. All the girls had to go and\r\nlook at him; and when Dolly picked him up, and bundled his cloak about\r\nhim, and put on his cap, he only stretched a little and settled himself,\r\nbeing as famous a sleeper as some of his Dutch ancestors. But the girls\r\nhad to kiss him; and then he did wake up and laugh and rub his eyes with\r\nhis fat fist. Before Stephen had him settled on his shoulder, he was\r\nasleep again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" cried Hanny, \"it's _his_ first party as well as mine. And when he\r\ngets old enough, I'll have to tell him all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" laughed his father. \"His memory can hardly he depended upon now.\"\r\n\r\nJim's friend came to wish Hanny good-night, and say that he had enjoyed\r\nhimself first rate,--quite a boy's word then. And he added, \"I think\r\nyour doctor-brother is the nicest man I ever met. If my mother is ever\r\nill, I mean she shall have him. He is so sweet and kindly. And that\r\nMiss Jasper is a beautiful girl!\"\r\n\r\nHanny flushed with delight.\r\n\r\nOne day, not long afterwards, Mrs. Jasper took both little girls down to\r\nStewart's beautiful store at the corner of Chambers Street and Broadway.\r\nWhen the ladies were out for a promenade, they used to drop in and see\r\nthe pretty articles. It was the finest store in New York; kid-gloves and\r\nlaces were specialties, but there were no end of elegant silks and India\r\nshawls, which were considered family heir-looms when you became the\r\nowner of one.\r\n\r\nSome of the more careful business-men shook their heads doubtfully over\r\nthe young merchant's extravagance, and predicted a collapse presently.\r\nBut he went on prospering, and even built another marble palace, and a\r\nmarble dwelling-place for himself.\r\n\r\nThen the Reeds and the Underhills were full of interest in their boys\r\nwho were to pass examinations for Columbia College. Charles stood high,\r\nbut he was rather nervous about it; and Jim never studied so hard in all\r\nhis life as the last three months. When there was any doubt, or even\r\nwhen there wasn't, he pressed Joe into service. However, they both came\r\noff with flying colours. Charles was the best scholar, undoubtedly; but\r\nJim had a way of making everything tell in his favour.\r\n\r\nMiss Lily Ludlow had quite given Jim the cold shoulder; but now she\r\nsmiled upon him again. Her sister had married very well; but Lily had\r\nquite resolved upon a rich husband. Still it would be something to have\r\nthe young and good-looking collegian in her train.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jasper pleaded to take Hanny with them to Saratoga for a little\r\nwhile; and Margaret said she and her husband would go up and spend a\r\nweek and bring her home. The Jaspers were to stay at a quiet cottage;\r\nand, after much persuasion, Mrs. Underhill consented, though she had an\r\nidea a fashionable watering-place was hardly proper for little girls;\r\nand her father was very loath to give her up even for a few weeks.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, the little girl was rather homesick for a night or\r\ntwo. There was so much to see, so many drives and all; but she had never\r\nbeen away alone before. And she did so miss sitting in her father's lap,\r\nand kissing him good-night. She was too big a girl of course; and one\r\ntime her mother asked her if she meant to keep up the habit when she was\r\na woman grown!\r\n\r\nShe had not thought of being grown-up. And she wished she could stay a\r\nlittle girl forever. Josie Dean was quite womanly already, and didn't\r\nwant to wear her hair in \"pigtails\" any more--indeed, quite fretted\r\nbecause her mother wouldn't let her put it up. But Tudie confessed to\r\nHanny \"that she should be awful sorry when she was too big to play with\r\ndolls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I put my beautiful doll away the Christmas Stevie was born,\" said\r\nHanny.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, if we had a big brother married, and a lovely little baby\r\nlike that, I wouldn't mind so much. But Josie is going to study and\r\nteach, and--oh, dear! Hanny Underhill, you're just the luckiest girl I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Deans thought it another piece of luck that she should go to\r\nSaratoga.\r\n\r\nThey went to Congress Hall, and drank some of the water that Hanny\r\nthought just horrid. Daisy didn't like it very much; but it had proved\r\nbeneficial the summer before. And they used to watch the beautifully\r\nattired ladies promenade the long piazza. Such lovely lawns and\r\norgandies and embroidered white gowns; such laces and sashes and\r\nribbons! Every afternoon they were out in force. They promenaded up and\r\ndown the street too, with dainty parasols, and often times no bonnet,\r\nbut a little square of lace with long lappets.\r\n\r\nOne evening after Margaret and the Doctor came, they all went in to the\r\nhop to look on. Hanny thought the dancing a bewitching sight, and could\r\nhave stayed up until midnight watching it. There were a good many quite\r\nfamous people whom Dr. Hoffman knew, and Hanny had seen on Broadway or\r\nup at Washington Square.\r\n\r\nDaisy was almost in despair at the thought of Hanny's return. Dr.\r\nHoffman had promised to take a brother physician's practice when he went\r\naway to recuperate, so he felt that he really could not extend his stay\r\nbeyond the week.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do wish I had a sister!\" groaned Daisy. \"Auntie is very nice, and\r\nmamma is the sweetest mother in the world; but I like to have some one\r\nwho thinks real young thoughts. I don't want to be grown up and\r\nsensible, and take an interest in tiresome things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's just stay little,\" laughed Hanny. \"Twelve isn't so very old.\"\r\n\r\n\"But being in your 'teens' seems on the way to it. _You_ may stay\r\nlittle; but see how tall I am getting. I grow like a weed.\"\r\n\r\nHanny gave a soft sigh. How curious to want to stay little, and feel\r\nsorry you were not getting big at the same time!\r\n\r\nWhen they returned to the city, Hanny found that Charles and his mother\r\nhad gone to the sea-side, out on Long Island. Mrs. Reed didn't seem to\r\nget strong. She had thought all along first she could soon do without\r\nCousin Jane; and to give her the opportunity Cousin Jane went away on a\r\nlittle visit. But Mr. Reed sent for her ten days later.\r\n\r\n\"I'm never going to be good for anything again!\" Mrs. Reed said\r\nfretfully.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, there are a good many useful things in the world beside work,\"\r\nreplied Mr. Reed. \"You've done your share. Cousin Jane is splendid to\r\nhave around. Anyhow, I think we will keep her for awhile.\"\r\n\r\n\"You just go down on Great South Bay, and eat fish and clams, and have\r\nthe sea-breeze,\" advised Cousin Jane. \"The Seamens will board you very\r\nreasonably. And Charles looks as if something of the kind wouldn't hurt\r\nhim. He will have a pretty hard pull in college the first year, and he\r\nought to have some good backbone to start on.\"\r\n\r\nIt was very extravagant to go away to board when they were paying\r\nhouse-rent. And there had been a doctor's bill, and a nurse for three\r\nweeks, and Cousin Jane--\r\n\r\n\"Never you mind,\" said Mr. Reed, \"I'm not anywhere near the poor-house.\r\nI've only you and Charles. He is going to be a credit to us if he keeps\r\nhis health; but he does look rather pale and thin. You ought to go for\r\nhis sake.\"\r\n\r\nThe Reeds seemed insensibly to have changed places. It was Mr. Reed who\r\ngave the orders and suggested the plans, and Mrs. Reed who acquiesced.\r\n\r\n\"You've worked steadily all your life, harder than I ever wanted you\r\nto,\" continued her husband. \"We had better take the good of what we\r\nhave, and let Charles earn his own money when it comes his time to work.\r\nAnd if you could improve a little,--at least I think it is your duty to\r\ntry for both our sakes. It will be a sad thing if, when Charles takes\r\nhis degree, you are not here to congratulate him.\"\r\n\r\nShe was not anxious to die; very few people are. So she listened, and\r\nallowed herself to be over-ruled. She was really proud of her son's\r\nmanliness, though she would not have admitted it. They went off to stay\r\na fortnight, and both improved so much they remained a whole month.\r\n\r\nJaney and Polly Odell and another cousin came to visit Hanny, and had a\r\nfine time seeing the city sights. Then Daisy came home, school began,\r\nand wonderful events were happening all the time.\r\n\r\nThe old story of Eldorado repeated itself. Strange rumours ran about\r\nlike wildfire in meadow grass. A Captain Sutter was having his mill-race\r\non one of the forks of the Sacramento River deepened and repaired, when\r\na workman accidently discovered a shining nugget that proved to be gold.\r\nCrowds flocked to the spot: men who had been in the army, adventurers\r\nwho had followed Frémont in his prospecting journeys; and they found\r\ngold on every hand.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress opened, President Polk proudly announced the wealth of our\r\nnew possessions. It was Mexico and Peru over again. The Spaniards had\r\nnot despoiled the whole earth.\r\n\r\nMen talked themselves up to fever-heat. Why plod along years making a\r\nfortune, when here you could dig it out of the ground in a few months!\r\nAs if wealth was the great and only good to mankind.\r\n\r\nNow, when one flies across the continent in a palace-car, it seems\r\nstrange indeed to think of the long journey of these pilgrims to the\r\nland of Ophir, as it was called. The overland route, that across Mexico,\r\nor the isthmus, comprised the sail to Vera Cruz, and then up the Pacific\r\ncoast, and was costly. That around Cape Horn took five months. Yet men\r\nwere selling their property or business that they had been years in\r\nbuilding up, leaving their families, and hurrying off, promising to be\r\nback in a few years, millionaires perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe Underhills were not seized with the mania. There were several other\r\nmatters that occupied their attention. John was to be married in\r\nJanuary, and to go in business with his employer, who would be his\r\nfather-in-law. And in December, two granddaughters were added to the\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nHanny was quite dazed with the conflicting claims. Margaret's little\r\ngirl had large dark eyes like Dr. Hoffman, and dark, silky hair; while\r\nDolly's daughter was fair. Margaret's baby was really beautiful.\r\n\r\nBut in her secret heart the little girl thought no baby in the world\r\ncould ever be the sweet and joyful surprise that Stevie had been,--the\r\nChristmas gift to them all. Dr. Hoffman declared that he was really\r\njealous that she should not transfer all her affections to his little\r\ndaughter. \"He should not call her Haneran now.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope you wouldn't,\" declared Hanny, mirthfully. \"You ought to\r\nname her Margaret, and we could all call her Daisy. That's such a\r\ncheerful, pretty name!\"\r\n\r\n\"But she won't be white and gold. She would have to be a Michaelmas\r\ndaisy. And we couldn't call her Pearl, with her dark eyes and hair.\r\nStill, I think Margaret one of the noblest and sweetest of names.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose any one will think Hannah a sweet name,\" said the\r\nlittle girl, rather ruefully. \"They all say--it's a _good_ name. But I\r\ndon't want to be just like Grandmother Van Kortlandt. When I am real old\r\nI would rather be like Grandmother Underhill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily, the names do not endow us with the natures.\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, it _was_ Margaret; and they called her Daisy, much to the\r\nlittle girl's delight. When Mrs. Jasper heard of the name, she sent her\r\na beautiful pair of sleeve-pins. They were used to pin through the\r\nshoulders and sleeves of babies' dresses. It seemed then as if all\r\nbabies had beautiful fat necks, and pretty dimpled arms.\r\n\r\nDolly's little girl was called Annette Dorothea; but her household name\r\nwas Annie.\r\n\r\nLittle Stevie had come to grandmother's to stay a week or so. He cried a\r\nlittle the first night for mamma. Hanny begged to have him put in her\r\nbed; and she sat and told him Mother Goose Melodies until he dropped\r\nasleep. He was such a sweet, cunning roly-poly, that she couldn't help\r\nkissing him when she came to bed; and she longed to take him in her arms\r\nand hug him up; but she was afraid he might wake and cry.\r\n\r\nThe next night he was quite ready to go to Nan's bed, and didn't cry a\r\nbit.\r\n\r\nHanny had a delightful time taking him round among the girls. Her mother\r\nsaid, \"You and your father will have that child spoiled.\" But Hanny\r\nmight have turned the tables, if she had seen grandmother when she had\r\nto be in school.\r\n\r\nAs for Grandfather Underhill, he thought with Hanny there never had been\r\nsuch a smart and wonderful baby. Jim taught him some rather\r\nreprehensible tricks. He was still full of fun and mischief, and already\r\nhad a crowd of admirers in college.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, how they missed the baby when he was gone! It didn't seem as\r\nif one little mite could fill the house; but it was big and empty now.\r\n\r\nJohn's courtship had not been so engrossing as Stephen's. They had met\r\nMiss Bradley, to be sure; and Mr. Bradley was a well-to-do man with two\r\nsons and one daughter who had been named Cleanthe, after the heroine of\r\na story Mrs. Bradley had read in her girlhood. Mr. Bradley had wanted\r\nhis daughter called Priscilla, after his mother; and Mrs. Bradley's\r\nmother's name was Jemima.\r\n\r\n\"I did think Mimy and Silly two of the worst names in the world. And\r\nthere isn't any nickname for Cleanthe,\" was Mrs. Bradley's explanation\r\nwhen any one wondered at the name.\r\n\r\nMiss Cleanthe was a very nice, well-bred, rather conventional girl, with\r\nnone of Dolly's dash and spirit. She was a good housekeeper, and could\r\nmake all but her best dresses. They were to take the second floor of Mr.\r\nBradley's house, and set up their own home, until they felt rich enough\r\nto indulge in a house owned by themselves.\r\n\r\nGeorge came down about this time to spend a month. He was decidedly\r\ntired of farming.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, if I wanted to marry and build on the old place, it wouldn't\r\nbe so bad. Uncle Faid keeps in the same rut, and you can't shake him out\r\nof it. Barton Finch is the kind of man who begins with a great flourish,\r\nbut flats out towards the end. I'm tired of them all!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be your turn to marry next,\" said his mother. \"And then I'll\r\nseem quite a young woman with only three children. I _do_ suppose we'll\r\ngo up to Yonkers some time and spend our old age there; though I begin\r\nto think your father is weaned away.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge laughed. \"Father seems about half Uncle Faid's age. And at\r\neighty, you won't be as old as Aunt Crete. If I had lots of money, to do\r\nas I liked--but farming so near by doesn't amount to much.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans and Swiss had to come in and show us about market-gardening\r\nand floriculture.\r\n\r\nGeorge went down-town with Stephen, and talked with Ben, and listened to\r\nthe groups on every corner discussing the golden land. He was young and\r\nstrong; why shouldn't he go and seek his fortune?\r\n\r\nMiss Bradley had a very nice evening wedding, with dancing and a supper.\r\nShe was very well looking, but not as handsome as Margaret, or as pretty\r\nand piquant as Dolly. She did not seem to come close to their hearts, as\r\nDolly had; though Mrs. Underhill was very well satisfied, and knew she\r\nwould make John happy. John was a sort of solid, sober-going fellow,\r\nquite different from Steve and Joe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE EYES OF YOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThen George surprised everybody by his determination to go to\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\"There are chances to make fortunes here,\" declared Stephen. \"With the\r\ncrowds going out there, and no homes and no provision made for them,\r\nthere must be a good deal of suffering. The stories of gold are too\r\nfabulous for belief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want to see something of the world. And all the countries on the\r\nPacific Coast are rich in gold and treasures. I wonder what the history\r\nof the world would have been if that side had been settled first?\"\r\n\r\n\"The history of Mexico and Peru. Wealth and indolence and degeneration.\r\nAnd the East is nearer the commerce of the world. Oh, the old Pilgrim\r\nfathers didn't go so far out of the way!\" laughingly.\r\n\r\n\"And they went in the face of almost everything. We have a little of\r\ntheir love of adventure. I don't know as my heart is so set upon a\r\nfortune. You wouldn't believe it; but I've wished myself that intrepid\r\nexplorer Frémont dozens of times. There is such a splendid excuse for\r\ngoing now.\"\r\n\r\nAt first, they were all strongly opposed. John told him to come and join\r\nthem, and keep turning his money over in up-town real estate. Mrs.\r\nUnderhill pleaded. She was very fond of having her children about her.\r\nBut when he went down-town, and heard the exciting talk, and saw the\r\nvessels of every kind fitting out, he came home more resolved than ever.\r\n\r\n\"And then we will build the house on that beautiful knoll,--a large,\r\nrambling, commodious place, big enough to take us all in, a refuge for\r\nour old age,\" laughed George.\r\n\r\nThey found he was not to be talked out of it. Ben was on his side, and\r\nnot only gave him encouragement, but offered to lend him a little money\r\nhe had saved up, and proposed to go shares with him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was a time of great excitement. The ship-yards on the East\r\nRiver were veritable bee-hives; and morning, noon, and night the streets\r\nwere thronged with workmen. The clipper-ships began to astonish the\r\nworld, and the steamers to compete with those of England. The new treaty\r\nwith China was opening possibilities of trade to that country.\r\n\r\nGeorge decided to go by water to Vera Cruz. Round the Horn seemed too\r\nlong a journey for impatient youth. If he shouldn't like it, and should\r\nnot see any special prospect, he could come back the richer by his\r\nexperience, if nothing else. People went to China. They often stayed two\r\nyears in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Ben; \"there's Mr. Theodore Whitney. He has had no end of a\r\ngood time, and is in much better health then when he went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Frémont has gone through a great many hardships, and been in some\r\nbattles, and still lives,\" added George, laughingly. \"And some of the\r\npeople in Yonkers died who had never been more than ten miles away from\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill gave in, as mothers of big sons are often forced to do.\r\nMr. Underhill was rather pleased with the boy's spirit. Doctor Joe felt\r\nthat it wasn't a bad thing altogether, and that it would be nice to have\r\nan authentic account of that wonderful country.\r\n\r\nSo the last of March, George said good-bye to everybody. His father,\r\nStephen, and Joe went down to see him off. It looked as if half the\r\nsailing-craft in the world were gathered in New York harbour.\r\n\r\nRight on the top of this, something happened that engrossed the\r\nattention of the younger members of the family. There had been a\r\ndisturbance in Paris; the old Bonaparte faction coming to the fore, and\r\nLouis Philippe had fled from the throne to England. Napoleon Bonaparte\r\nhad shattered the divine right of kings nearly forty years earlier.\r\n\r\nBut the most startling link in the chain of events, was that Louis\r\nNapoleon, the son of Hortense Beauharnais and the once King of Holland,\r\nwho, for fomenting one revolution, had been confined in the Fortress of\r\nHam for life. He had escaped, and, with the prestige of the family\r\nname, had roused the enthusiasm of France, and helped to form a\r\nRepublic. He was elected as one of the Deputies. Everybody was saying\r\nthen the French were too volatile, and too fond of grandeur, to accept\r\nthe democratic tendencies of a republic for any length of time. And they\r\nwondered if he would not follow in the steps of his famous uncle, and\r\none day aim at a throne and an empire. Others hailed the step as a great\r\nadvancement in the rights of the people, and thought it prefigured that\r\nEurope would be republican rather than Cossack, recalling the elder\r\nEmperor's prediction.\r\n\r\nAnd Hanny learned that this young man, who was before long to be Emperor\r\nof the French, had lived in New York, as well as Louis Philippe. Joe\r\ntook her down-town to the old Delmonico Restaurant, which was considered\r\nquite elegant in its day, and had entertained many famous people. Here,\r\nthe young fellow who had been the son of a king, and was now an exile,\r\nused to dine, and gather about him the flower of the fashionable world,\r\nas it was called. And Lorenzo Delmonico, who rarely went into his\r\nkitchen now, would go and cook a dinner for this guest, who had the high\r\nart of persuasion in an eminent degree, it would seem. Afterward the\r\nPrince would entertain the other guests with curious tricks with cards,\r\nand conversation. Now his life bid fair to be almost as eventful as his\r\nuncle's; and, like him, he was doomed to die an exile on English soil.\r\n\r\nJoe and Hanny took their dinner in the old place, though now the\r\nDelmonicos were fitting up a hotel at the lower end of Broadway which\r\nwas destined to become quite as famous, and to house many notable\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nShe was so engrossed with reading and studying that sometimes she hardly\r\nfound an hour for the babies. She and Daisy, like most very young girls,\r\nhad a passion for poetry. Mrs. Sigourney they thought rather grave and\r\ndry; but Mrs. Hemans, with her soft flowing numbers and beautiful face,\r\nwas a great favourite. Longfellow was beginning to be appreciated, and\r\nseveral other poets that one saw now and then on Broadway. There were\r\nsome pathetic poems by a Western writer, Alice Cary, that used to go\r\nquite to the little girl's tender heart. She had a wonderful memory for\r\nany rhythmic production, and used to say them over to her father. If she\r\ndidn't sit on his lap,--and her mother had almost laughed her out of\r\nit,--she leaned her arms on his knee, or rested her head against his\r\nshoulder, while her soft, sweet voice went purling along like,--\r\n\r\n      \"A hidden brook\r\n    In the leafly month of June.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dean girls did not care so much for poetry. They wanted stories; and\r\nstories and books were beginning to spring up on every hand. Miss Delia\r\nWhitney was writing a novel. She had accomplished some successful\r\nstories, and had one in \"The Ladies' Book,\" the pretty fashion magazine\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nPoor deaf Aunt Clem had dropped out of life like a child going to sleep.\r\nAunt Patty kept well and bright. Nora was growing up into a tall girl,\r\nand went to Rutger's Institute, though she confessed to Hanny, \"She just\r\nhated all schools, and wouldn't go a day longer, only it was not quite\r\nthe thing to grow up an ignoramus.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was Frederica Bremer, a Swedish novelist, whose \"Home or\r\nFamily Cares and Family Joys\" was Hanny's delight. And Irving was ever\r\nnew and bright. \"Salmagundi\" always amused her father so much. The\r\nrecent and delightful stories were the talk of every one.\r\n\r\nDaisy was not such a ravenous reader. She was quite taken up with\r\npainting, and had done some very nice work in water-colours. She had a\r\ndecided gift for catching resemblances, and had sketched some excellent\r\nlikenesses. She confided to Hanny that her ambition was to paint\r\nportraits on ivory.\r\n\r\nThis spring a plan was mooted that almost rendered Hanny speechless. Mr.\r\nJasper had some business connections abroad that needed his personal\r\nsupervision, and he proposed to take his family. Tours to Europe were\r\nnot a common occurrence then, and one could hardly run over for a six\r\nweeks' trip. Daisy had improved so much that she was sure to enjoy it;\r\nand there were some German baths Doctor Joe thought he would like her to\r\ntry.\r\n\r\nItaly had been the children's land of romance. But the Deans never\r\nexpected to go; and Hanny was quite sure she should feel awfully afraid\r\non the ocean. But Joe said some time when he had grown quite rich, and\r\nneeded a rest for his tired-out body and nerves, he and Hanny might\r\ngo,--ten years hence, perhaps. It wasn't nearly so formidable when you\r\nlooked at it through the telescope of ten years; and Hanny could be\r\nlearning French and German, and may be Italian. She had picked up a good\r\ndeal of German already from Barbara, who had proved an excellent servant\r\nafter she had acquired American ways.\r\n\r\nThe Jaspers would give up their house and store their choicest\r\nfurniture. Opposite, a great many foreigners were crowding in; and down\r\nbelow, Houston Street and Avenue A. were filling up with them. We felt\r\nso large and grand then, with our great stretches of unoccupied land,\r\nthat we invited the oppressed from everywhere. It was our boast that,--\r\n\r\n    \"Uncle Sam was rich enough to give us all a farm.\"\r\n\r\nVery good thrifty citizens many of them made; but some of the early\r\nexperiences were not so agreeable. And people were beginning to think\r\n\"up-town\" would be the choice for residences. Even Mr. Dean had a vague\r\nidea of buying up there while property was cheap. Stephen and Margaret\r\nwere trying to persuade their parents to do the same thing.\r\n\r\nIt would be dreadful to have Daisy go away for a whole year. When Daisy\r\nconsidered the point, it didn't seem as if she could leave all her girl\r\nfriends and her dear Doctor Joe. But the days passed on, and the passage\r\nwas taken. Mrs. Jasper asked the children in to a supper, which would\r\nhave been delightful, except for the thought that it was a farewell\r\nsupper. The table was spread in most artistic array; and Sam waited upon\r\nthe company. They tried very hard to be merry; but every little while\r\nthey would all subside and glance at each other with apprehensive eyes.\r\n\r\nThe grown people came in the evening. The most wonderful thing was that\r\nMr. and Mrs. Reed were among the parents. Cousin Jane was still at the\r\nReeds'; and, as she was \"handy\" about sewing, she had altered Mrs.\r\nReed's old-fashioned gowns, and made her some new ones.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed did not get real strong, and was troubled somewhat with a\r\ncough when cold weather came on. But she lost her weather-beaten look,\r\nand did gain a little flesh. She was very presentable in her black-silk\r\ndress, with some lace at the throat and wrists that she had bought at\r\nher marriage. She wore a little black-lace head-dress with a few purple\r\nbows; and she admitted to Charles that the Jaspers were very fine\r\npeople, and she was sorry they were going away; but it would take a mint\r\nof money for a whole family to travel around like that.\r\n\r\nThe Jaspers' house was then dismantled; but they were going to board for\r\nabout ten days. Hanny and Josie Dean went down to see the state-room and\r\nwish them _bon voyage_. Doctor Joe had given Mrs. Jasper counsel about\r\neverything that might happen to Daisy.\r\n\r\nThen the signal was given for all who were not going to return on shore.\r\nThere were some tender kisses and tears; and Doctor Joe took both girls\r\nby the arm and steadied them down the gang-plank. What a huge thing the\r\nsteamer looked! But it was nothing compared to the later ones.\r\n\r\nIt was very lonesome. The night was pleasant, and Hanny sat out on the\r\nstoop with her father; but, whenever she tried to talk, something\r\nswelled up in her throat and made her feel like crying. But her father\r\nhugged her up close. She would always have him.\r\n\r\nIt had not seemed so sad to have Nora go away; in fact they could see\r\nher any time. And she had not loved Nora quite so well. She didn't love\r\nany girl as she loved Daisy, and it seemed as if she could not live a\r\nwhole year without her.\r\n\r\nThey talked about it at school, and most of the girls envied her the\r\nsplendid journey. \"I don't know as I would mind being a little lame, if\r\nI could have such a beautiful face, and be taken everywhere,\" said one\r\nof the girls.\r\n\r\nBut Hanny didn't want to be anybody else, if she had to give up her own\r\nmother and father, and dear Joe and Ben and, oh, little darling Stevie.\r\n\r\nJust after this a black-bordered envelope came up from Hammersley\r\nStreet. Grandfather Bounett, who had been very feeble of late, had died.\r\nHanny had seen him a number of times since her memorable introductory\r\nvisit. Luella had been sent to boarding-school, and was quite toned\r\ndown, was indeed a young lady.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe had made frequent visits, and the old gentleman had told him\r\nmany striking incidents of his life. Hanny used to think how queer the\r\ncity must have been in seventeen hundred, when people had a black\r\nservant to carry the lantern so one could see to get about. She knew so\r\nmuch of the early history now,--the Dutch reign and the British reign\r\nand the close of the war.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Bounett looked like a picture in his handsome, old-fashioned\r\nattire; and he just seemed asleep. The large rooms and the hall were\r\nfull, and men were standing out on the sidewalk. He had rounded out the\r\ncentury. A hundred years was a long while to live. There were a number\r\nof French people, and a chapter was read out of grandfather's well-worn\r\nFrench Bible.\r\n\r\nSomehow it was not a sorrowful funeral. It was indeed bidding him a\r\nreverent God speed on his journey to the better land.\r\n\r\nAbout ten days afterward, they were surprised by a visit from the eldest\r\nmarried daughter, Mrs. French, whom Hanny had taken such a fancy to\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\n\"I've come of a queer errand,\" she explained, when they had talked over\r\nthe ordinary matters. \"I want a visit from little Miss Hanny. I have\r\nbeen away with my husband a good many times since we first met, and now\r\nhe has gone to China, and will be absent still a year longer. I am\r\nkeeping house alone, except as I have some nieces now and then staying\r\nwith me. I want to take Hanny over on Friday, if I may, and she shall\r\ncome back in time for school on Monday morning. I have a great many\r\ncuriosities to show her. And perhaps some of her brothers will come over\r\nand take tea with us Sunday evening.\"\r\n\r\nHanny was a little shy and undecided. But her mother assented readily.\r\nShe thought a change would do her good, as she had moped since Daisy's\r\ndeparture.\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged that Mrs. French should come on the ensuing Friday.\r\nHanny almost gave out; but when the carriage drove up to the door, and\r\nMrs. French looked so winsome and smiling, she said good-bye to her\r\nmother with a sudden accession of spirits.\r\n\r\nThey drove to Grand Street Ferry and crossed over on the boat.\r\nWilliamsburg was a rather straggling place then. It was quite a distance\r\nfrom the ferry, not closely built up, though the street was long and\r\nstraight. At the south side of the house was an extra lot in a flower\r\nand vegetable garden. The house was quite pretty, two stories with a\r\npeaked roof, and a wisteria going up to the top. There was a wide porch\r\nwith a hammock hung already. All the air was sweet with a great bed of\r\nlilies of the valley,--quite a rarity then.\r\n\r\nThere was a long parlor, and then a music-room; in a sort of an ell, a\r\ndining-room and kitchen; upstairs, two beautiful sleeping chambers and a\r\nsmall sewing-room with a writing-desk and some book-shelves.\r\n\r\nHanny felt as if she were entering an Oriental palace. The doorways and\r\nwindows were hung with glistening silk that had flecks of gold and\r\nsilver in it; and there were such soft rugs on the floor your feet were\r\nburied in them. It was almost like a museum, with the queer tables and\r\ncabinets, and the curious fragrance pervading every corner.\r\n\r\nThey went upstairs and took off their hats and capes, which were one of\r\nthis spring's fashions.\r\n\r\n\"This is my room,\" explained Mrs. French. \"And with the door open you\r\nwon't feel afraid in the guest-chamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had to sleep alone since Margaret was married,\" returned the\r\nlittle girl. \"No, I am not afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I would not ask any one else. I wanted you all to myself,\"\r\nand Mrs. French smiled. \"I have hosts of nieces and nephews. There was\r\nsuch a large family of us.\"\r\n\r\nHanny thought she would rather be the only guest now. She was quite\r\nfascinated with Mrs. French.\r\n\r\nShe bathed her face and brushed her hair. She had brought a pretty white\r\nruffled apron. The little girls didn't wear black-silk aprons now; but\r\nthey were taught to be careful of their clothes, and I think they were\r\nquite proud of their pretty aprons. Hanny's had dainty little pockets\r\nand a pink bow on each one.\r\n\r\nThe frocks were made shorter, and the pantalets kept them company. All\r\nthat was really proper now, was a row of fine tucks and a ruffle, or an\r\nedge of needlework. There was some fine imported French needlework, much\r\nof it done in convents; but nearly every lady did it herself, and it was\r\nquite a great thing for a little girl to bring out her work and show it\r\nto aunts and cousins. No one dreamed then that there would be machines\r\nto make the finest and most exquisite work, and save time and eyesight.\r\n\r\nHanny looked very sweet and pretty in her pink lawn and white apron. Her\r\nhair was braided in the two tails that every little girl wore who had\r\nnot curly hair. On grand occasions, Hanny's was put in curl-papers, and\r\nit made very nice ringlets, though it was still a sort of flaxen brown.\r\nBut then she was fair, rather pale a good deal of the time. She flushed\r\nvery easily though. There was an expression of trustful innocence that\r\nrendered her very attractive, without being beautiful like Margaret.\r\n\r\n\"Come and let us walk about the garden,\" said Mrs. French. \"It is light\r\nenough to see the roses. They are my especial pride.\"\r\n\r\nHanny took the outstretched hand. She could not have explained it, but\r\nshe did feel happy and at home with Mrs. French. There was a\r\ngraciousness about her that set one at ease.\r\n\r\nAt the side was a long porch with curtains that rolled up when they were\r\nnot needed for shade. At the front of the garden, there was considerable\r\nyoung shrubbery, then an arrangement of beds; the centre one, which was\r\na circle, was filled with the most beautiful roses. The middle was\r\nraised somewhat, mound shape, with the dark red roses, then growing a\r\nlittle paler to pure rose-colour and pink, tea-rose with the salmon\r\ntint, and a border of white. And, oh, how fragrant!\r\n\r\nBeside this bed there were others in clusters, and one clump in an\r\nexquisite yellow.\r\n\r\n\"Some of them have been great travellers,\" said Mrs. French. \"There are\r\nroses from Spain, from France and Italy.\"\r\n\r\nHanny opened her eyes very wide, and then she looked at them again in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how could you get them?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I brought them from their homes. You see I have been quite a traveller,\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\nThe child drew a long breath. \"Did you go with Captain French?\" she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. When we were first married, his vessel traded in the Levant, and\r\nbrought back fruits and silks and shawls and nuts, and ever so many\r\nthings. After that we went to India, Calcutta. We took one of my\r\nsisters, and she married an English merchant, and has been home only\r\nonce since then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I shouldn't like Margaret to live in Calcutta,\" the little girl\r\nsaid, startled.\r\n\r\nMrs. French smiled. \"Then we were away almost four years. We went to the\r\nChinese ports as well, and to some of the curious islands. We took a\r\ncargo of tea to London.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know a little girl who has just gone to London, and who is to go on\r\nto Germany to take some special kind of baths. She is my very dear\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a great deal better now. When we first knew her, she couldn't\r\nwalk but a few steps. She was in the hospital where my brother used to\r\ngo when he was first a doctor. Then she came to live in our street.\"\r\n\r\n\"With her parents?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. She has one aunt, but no brothers or sisters. It must seem\r\nstrange not to have any,\" and Hanny glanced up.\r\n\r\n\"It would be strange to me. I had ten in all, and there is only one\r\ndead. Eugene is the oldest of the second family. One married brother\r\nlives in Baltimore, one only a short distance from here. And you have\r\nsix brothers,--a good supply for one little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose some of them belong to Margaret,\" and she gave a soft,\r\nrippling laugh. \"We haven't ever divided them up. But Joe belongs to me.\r\nWhen I get to be a woman, and he has a good big practice, I am going to\r\nkeep house for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will your father do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--\" Hanny had not considered that point. \"Oh, it won't be in a long\r\nwhile! And then father will be old, and he will come and live with us, I\r\nthink. Dolly says she is going to have mother.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. French thought the division rather amusing.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Captain French gone now?\"\r\n\r\n\"To China again. He has been going back and forth to Liverpool; but he\r\nhad an excellent offer for the long trip. I concluded not to go,\r\ngrandpa was so old and feeble. And my sister is coming to England to\r\nlive. Her husband is heir now to a fine estate and a title; and they\r\nhave quite a family of children.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will want to go to England to see her,\" said Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I shall. I have not seen her in seven years; since the time she\r\nwas here.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all liked Mr. Eugene so much,\" Hanny remarked. \"And Luella has grown\r\nso, I hardly knew her.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have a trick of growing up. I hope you won't be in any hurry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am small of my age,\" and Hanny gave a soft sigh.\r\n\r\n\"It will take you a long time to get as large as your mother.\"\r\n\r\nHanny wasn't sure that she wanted to be quite so large. Yet she didn't\r\nreally want her mother changed. And, oh, she wouldn't have her as thin\r\nas Mrs. Reed for all the world!\r\n\r\nThey had been walking around the paths that were clean and solid as a\r\nfloor. What beautiful plants and flowers there were! Strange things,\r\ntoo, that Hanny had never seen before. Then the tea-bell rang, and they\r\ncame up to the rose garden, where Mrs. French broke off several partly\r\nopened buds and pinned them on the little girl's bodice.\r\n\r\nThe dining-room windows opened on the porch, and they walked in that\r\nway. It had a great beaufet with carved shelves and brackets going\r\nnearly up to the ceiling, and full of the most curious articles Hanny\r\nhad ever seen. Then there was a cabinet in the corner containing rare\r\nand beautiful china. The table was small and dainty, oval, with a vase\r\nof flowers at the ends; and the two sat opposite each other, while a\r\ntidy young coloured girl waited upon them.\r\n\r\nHanny felt as if she was part of a story; and she tried to recall\r\nseveral of her heroines who went visiting in some curiously elegant\r\nhouse. It was different from the Jaspers, from anything she had ever\r\nseen, and there was a subtle fragrance about it that made her feel\r\ndreamy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGOING VISITING\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Don't you want to tell me about your little friend?\" Mrs. French said\r\nwhen she had put Hanny in the hammock, and hedged her about with silken\r\ncushions. She sat in a willow rocker that Hanny thought quite as\r\nfascinating as the hammock.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" and Hanny smiled brightly, and, like a true biographer began\r\nat the beginning, the first time the children had seen Daisy, with her\r\nlong golden curls and pallid face, like a snow-drift. And how Doctor Joe\r\nhad been in the hospital when she had the operation performed.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little thing!\" exclaimed Mrs. French. \"And now there is something\r\nthey can use that gives a blessed unconsciousness, and when you wake up\r\nthe worst of the pain is over. I do not know how any one could endure\r\nsuch torture.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joe said she was very brave, though she fainted several times. And\r\nshe's growing straight and tall, and her hair curls lovely again. I have\r\nalways wished my hair curled naturally. It just twists a little at the\r\nends, but won't make ringlets.\"\r\n\r\nPeople in those days curled their hair a great deal; but they had to put\r\nit in papers. Patent curlers, like a great many other things, had not\r\nbeen invented. When you wanted to be very fine, you went to the\r\nhair-dresser's. The real society ladies had some one come to the house\r\nto \"do\" their hair; and sometimes it was very elaborate.\r\n\r\nMrs. French thought curly hair would not improve the little girl. There\r\nwas something charming in her very simplicity, and her hair was like\r\nfloss silk.\r\n\r\nAs she told about Daisy she detailed bits of neighbourhood life, and\r\ndescriptions of the other children. Mrs. French heard about John Robert\r\nCharles and his mother.\r\n\r\n\"But she's so different now. She is not real strong any more; and then\r\nCharles is such a big boy, and goes out with his father. It's queer, but\r\nJim and he are great friends, and Jim goes over there to study with\r\nCharles. Mrs. Reed did not use to like boys; and Jim is so full of fun\r\nand pranks, mother calls them, and he knows so many funny stories!\r\nMother tries very hard not to laugh at them; but she can't always help\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening passed so quickly that it was bed-time before either of them\r\nrealised it. Mrs. French took the large square pillows off the bed, and\r\nlaid one of the silken spreads over the footboard. How beautiful and\r\nsoft they were, with great flowers so natural it seemed as if you could\r\npick them up! And the fragrance was so delicate and puzzling: one moment\r\nyou thought it violets, then it suggested roses and lilies and the smell\r\nof newly cut grass.\r\n\r\nMrs. French kissed her, and said if she felt strange in the night to\r\ncall her; but she was asleep in five minutes, and never woke until quite\r\nin the morning, it was so much more quiet than in First Street.\r\n\r\nWhen she did sit up in the bed and glance around, she had a queer\r\nfeeling that she was a part of a fairy story, like the white cat in her\r\nenchanted palace, waiting for the Prince, or perhaps Psyche, blown from\r\nthe hill-top to her beautiful place of refuge, where she found and lost\r\nLove, and had to do many hard tasks before she could regain him.\r\n\r\nShe was quite sure, an hour or two later, that she _was_ in some\r\nenchanted realm. There were such queer things,--some beautiful, and some\r\nshe thought very ugly, especially the grotesque idols.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't believe a god like that had any power. And I am sure I\r\ncouldn't worship him,\" Hanny said emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"They beat their gods sometimes and break them to pieces, and go off and\r\nget new ones. It seems very singular to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl had been deeply interested in Judson, the missionary to\r\nBurmah. There had been a good deal of romance about his last marriage,\r\nto \"Fanny Forester,\" who wrote tales and sketches and poems, and had\r\nmade herself quite a name for brightness and gay humour, and then had\r\nsurprised her friends by going to India as a missionary's wife. And she\r\nknew Bishop Heber's beautiful poem to his wife all by heart, and often\r\nsang \"From Greenland's icy mountains.\" So she had a feeling that she did\r\nknow something about India.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. French had really been there, and spent two months at Bombay,\r\nand almost six months at Calcutta. There were so many gorgeous\r\nthings,--silks, and bright stuffs with threads of gold, jackets all\r\nembroidery, and queer Eastern dresses, two made of pineapple cloth,--a\r\nsheer, beautiful fabric,--and one had delicate flowers embroidered in\r\nsilk.\r\n\r\nBut the oddest of all, Hanny thought, was burning incense. Mrs. French\r\nhad several curious incense bowls and jars. She lighted one, and in a\r\nlittle while the room was filled with an indescribable fragrance and a\r\nhazy purplish air.\r\n\r\n\"They burn incense in the Roman Catholic churches. Joe took us one\r\nEaster Sunday. It was very strange, I thought. And a little boy swung\r\nthe--something--\"\r\n\r\n\"Censer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, censer. And the singing was beautiful. But we couldn't\r\nunderstand the prayers; Joe said they were Latin. I suppose he could\r\nfollow them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt; I have attended some very grand services in churches abroad\r\nand in England.\"\r\n\r\nThe incense burned out presently, and they went downstairs to dinner.\r\nAfterward, a niece and nephew, her brother's children, came. The girl\r\nwas not quite twelve, but most a head taller than Hanny, who felt rather\r\nshy with her. The boy was older still, and his name was Harold, which\r\nsuggested to Hanny the last of the Saxon kings. But he was very dark,\r\nand didn't look like a Saxon, she thought.\r\n\r\nMrs. French sent to the livery and ordered a carriage, and they all went\r\nto drive. Hanny was quite conversant with upper New York and Westchester\r\nCounty; but she had only been once to Brooklyn. It had quite a country\r\naspect then; but there were beautiful drives, and Greenwood Cemetery had\r\nalready some extremely handsome monuments.\r\n\r\nThere was something about Eva Bounett that suggested Lily Ludlow, and\r\nkept Hanny from liking her cordially. She laughed at so many things,\r\nmade fun of them; and Hanny wondered if she was criticising her, and\r\nwould laugh at her when she returned home.\r\n\r\nNow and then, Mrs. French would remark, \"Don't, Eva, that is not a nice\r\nthing to say.\" Still she was bright, and at times Hanny had to laugh.\r\nShe found so many Dickens' people along the streets; and really they did\r\nlook like the pictures by Cruikshank. And one tall fierce old woman,\r\nwith wisps of hair hanging about her neck, and an old torn shawl, who\r\nwas brandishing her arms and talking wildly, she said was Meg Merrilies.\r\n\r\nThe children remained to tea, and Harold played and sang some very\r\npretty songs afterward.\r\n\r\n\"But you ought to hear our sister Helen,\" declared Eva. \"She sings in\r\nchurch, and sometimes at concerts; she's just magnificent. She's\r\nnineteen now. And Mary has a good voice; while I sing like a crow! Do\r\nyou do any of the fine things,--draw or paint? I take music lessons; but\r\nI make my teacher's hour vexation of spirit, not vanity,\" and she gave a\r\nsatisfied kind of laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I study music and French. I embroider and crochet--\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate sewing; I'd like to be a man and a sea-captain. Uncle French is\r\njust magnificent; I hope he will take me to sea sometime; I'm not a bit\r\nsick; are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never been to sea,\" replied Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just a little ways; I've been down to the Fishing Banks; and it's\r\nawful rough. And last summer we were at Great South Bay, and went out in\r\na yacht; and I learned to row. At all events, I mean to marry a\r\nsea-captain; and I'll just go with him every time.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the older brothers dropped in for the children. Eva was very\r\neffusive in her good-bye, and kissed Hanny, and said she must surely\r\ncome to see her.\r\n\r\nHanny felt quite relieved when she was alone again with Mrs. French, who\r\ntalked of Helen and Mary, and seemed to admire them very much. \"But I\r\ndon't know what they will do with Eva. My half-sister, Luella, was just\r\nsuch a noisy harum-scarum; but she had only boys to play with. Now, she\r\nis getting to be a nice lady-like girl.\"\r\n\r\nHanny recalled two visits in Hammersley Street when Luella had kept her\r\nin a fright all the time.\r\n\r\nThey went to church Sunday morning, and heard Helen Bounett sing. It was\r\nvery fine and moving. Hanny wished Charles could hear her.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-afternoon, as they were sitting on the front piazza, which was\r\nshady now, Hanny espied her two brothers. Why, Ben was quite as tall as\r\nJoe! He looked more like Stephen; but Joe was _very_ good-looking.\r\n\r\nShe flew down to meet them, and gave one hand to each brother.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried joyfully, \"I've had a lovely time! I've been to India\r\nand China; and I've had incense and ginger preserve, and some beautiful\r\nsilks to take home, and a pineapple handkerchief, and a ginger-jar; and\r\nI haven't been a bit homesick.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. French was watching the eager little face that looked so pretty in\r\nits enthusiasm of love. Doctor Joe stooped and kissed her; Ben waited\r\nuntil he was up on the porch.\r\n\r\nThey were very cordially welcomed. Mrs. French said she was afraid a\r\npatient would come to hand at an inopportune moment.\r\n\r\n\"The city is desperately healthy,\" returned Joe, laughingly. \"That's a\r\nyoung doctor's experience. When I am wrinkled and grey-haired, I shall\r\nprobably tell a different story.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think I have?\" turning to Hanny. \"A letter from Mr. Jasper.\r\nA steamer was just going out, so he sent a few lines.\"\r\n\r\nHe handed it to her while he resumed his conversation with Mrs. French.\r\n\r\nHanny devoured it with a thrill. A letter from across the ocean!\r\n\r\nThey had a very pleasant journey, with only one storm worth mentioning.\r\nMrs. Jasper, who had dreaded sea-sickness, had only a slight attack.\r\nAunt Ellen was ill four days, and Daisy a whole week. Once they were\r\nquite alarmed about her. But her recovery was more rapid than they had\r\nexpected; and now they were all well, and the ladies would write more at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nAn ocean voyage was quite an undertaking then. Some people of leisure\r\nwent by a packet, which took three weeks, occasionally longer.\r\n\r\nIt was very odd to think of Daisy Jasper in England. But how many times\r\nMrs. French had come home safely.\r\n\r\nOf course they must go out and see the flowers: the beautiful red rose\r\nwhose mother, or grandmother, had come from the Escurial at Madrid; and\r\na real English hawthorn, from Windermere, just out of bloom now; and\r\nseveral valuable and curious foreign plants, quite common at this day.\r\nAt the southern end there was a conservatory for the housing of the more\r\ndelicate ones.\r\n\r\nBen was wonderfully interested with the indoor curiosities, and a case\r\nof stuffed birds, the like of which he had never seen. They had a little\r\nmore incense too, and opened jars of rare perfume that was nobody knew\r\nhow many years old. There were some Chinese paintings on fine\r\ntransparent silk, and ivory carvings that were enough to puzzle the\r\nmost astute brain. Ben thought he would like to spend at least a month\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nSupper-time came too soon. Mrs. French said she had enjoyed every moment\r\nof Hanny's visit, and hoped to have her a whole week in the summer\r\nvacation, and the young men must feel they would be welcome any time.\r\n\r\n\"I've just been crowded full of delight,\" exclaimed Hanny, with her\r\ngood-bye kiss.\r\n\r\nIt was quite a walk down to the ferry; then they had their sail across.\r\nHow still and tranquil everything seemed! When they reached the city,\r\npeople were going to church, and a few last bells were ringing. They\r\nwalked leisurely up Grand Street; and, at the junction of East Broadway,\r\nJoe said he would run up to the office to see if he was needed for\r\nanything. Then Ben and Hanny kept on. There were a good many private\r\nresidences in Grand Street, but the stores were creeping along. Already\r\nthey began to show foreign names, and on some stoops a whole Jewish\r\nfamily would be sitting with their black-eyed children. And so many of\r\nthem had such beautiful curling hair that it made Hanny sigh.\r\n\r\nAcross Norfolk Street to Houston, and a turn in their own First Street.\r\nMr. Underhill had walked down to the corner, and was sauntering about.\r\nHe was very glad to get his little girl home and hear about the good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, the little girl had a letter from Daisy Jasper, all\r\nto herself. They had gone straight up to London on account of business,\r\nand were at a hotel; but it was all so queer and unlike New York. She\r\ncertainly did like her own city best. But there would be so many things\r\nto see; not the least among them would be the Queen and Prince Albert,\r\nand the royal children, who were often out driving, and the Mall and the\r\nRow, and the palaces, and the Tower, and the great British Museum! Daisy\r\nthought, if she went everywhere, it would take a whole lifetime. She was\r\nbeginning to feel very well; but she admitted that she was awfully\r\nseasick, and that it was \"horrid.\" She wanted Hanny, and dear Doctor\r\nJoe. And Hanny must tell her about everybody in the street. She must get\r\nsome thin foreign paper, so the postage wouldn't cost so much.\r\n\r\nFor then postage was regulated by the distance, and we had no\r\ninternational union. I think we were doing without a good many useful\r\nthings; yet the older generation professed to believe there was so much\r\nluxury and ease that people would be soon demoralised.\r\n\r\nJim had rather fallen behind, with all his fun and nonsense, and was\r\nstudying day and night. He wasn't going to have Charley Reed get so far\r\nahead of him! Examinations were coming on, and he didn't want any one to\r\nbe ashamed of him, neither did he want to be conditioned.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was studying very hard also, and reading a great deal.\r\nShe had taken up the wonderful things of London that had been\r\naccumulating year by year. She had thought New York was getting quite\r\nancient, but, oh, dear! England had been colonised by Julius Cæsar, and\r\nwas a country with a government even before that.\r\n\r\nThere was no one to go out with, and she was too old to play. Last\r\nsummer, they had gone around with Daisy in her wheeling-chair, and found\r\nso many amusing incidents, beside being out of doors in the vivifying\r\nair and sunshine. Josie Dean was almost a young lady, so tall that she\r\nwore her hair in a French twist, with a pretty silver comb, which was as\r\nmuch a girl's ambition as the big shell comb had been her mother's. And\r\nTudie was just crazy over worsted work. She was doing a pair of covers\r\nfor large ottomans, and then meant to go at the back and seat for a\r\ndaintily carved reception-chair. There were some nice schoolmates who\r\nlived up above Mrs. Craven's; but they seldom came down to First Street.\r\nAnd as the little girl never complained, no one seemed to notice that\r\nshe grew pale and thin, until one day Mrs. Underhill exclaimed:--\r\n\r\n\"Mercy me! What is the matter with that child! She looks like a ghost.\"\r\n\r\n\"She never does have red cheeks except when she is excited,\" said her\r\nfather. \"But she has fallen away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too hard study and too much staying in the house,\" said Doctor Joe.\r\n\r\n\"But I _must_ study one week more,\" declared the little girl. \"I'm going\r\nto have a beautiful French exercise,\"--they didn't always adapt their\r\nadjectives to the fine shades of meaning,--\"and I'm at the head in\r\nhistory. I want to get in the senior grade. I feel well, only tired, and\r\nmy head aches sometimes.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe examined her pulse and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you the week,\" he said; but her heart went up to her throat.\r\nWhat if he had _not_ given her the week!\r\n\r\nThey all came off with flying colours. Charles's Latin was the finest;\r\nbut he had been studying it several years. Jim's essay won him much\r\npraise. And the little girl achieved her heart's desire. She was in the\r\nsecond grade of the seniors, and would graduate in two years.\r\n\r\nThey had hardly decided what to do with her; but one day Mrs. Odell came\r\ndown with Polly, who had cheeks like roses and was fat as a seal, her\r\nmother said.\r\n\r\n\"You just let her come up and stay awhile with us, and drink buttermilk,\r\nand run out of doors and play in the hay. She's lived in the city long\r\nenough for a country girl, and she wants a change to freshen up her\r\nblood. She's fairly blue, she's so white.\"\r\n\r\n\"That wouldn't be a bad idea,\" rejoined Mr. Underhill. \"We could drive\r\nup every few days and see her.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill looked up much interested.\r\n\r\nMargaret was engrossed with her baby, and then she went out driving\r\nevery day, though they did talk of going away for a week the last of the\r\nsummer. She was very fond of having her little sister visit her, and\r\nHanny enjoyed the talks about books and the delightful people the\r\nHoffmans were always meeting.\r\n\r\nAll the Beekman daughters were going to stay awhile at the farm and\r\ndiscuss the settlement of the estate. The city authorities were to cut\r\ntwo streets through it in the early autumn. They had a very fair offer\r\nfor the house, from a second or third cousin who fancied he wanted a\r\npart of the old family estate. The ground, of course, was too valuable\r\nfor farming purposes. Annette's husband, who was in a shipping firm then\r\non Water Street, preferred living down-town. So Mrs. Beekman would keep\r\nthe old city house, and they would live together.\r\n\r\nDolly proposed to take the little girl, for there would be a large\r\nout-of-doors.\r\n\r\n\"There are too many grown people,\" declared Doctor Joe. \"She's too old\r\nherself, and too anxious for knowledge of all kinds. She wants to run\r\nand play with children. We must keep her a little girl as long as\r\npossible, and not bother her brains with the wisdom of the ages. Send\r\nher up to West Farms. As Father says, we can see her every few days.\"\r\n\r\nThat settled the matter. Father Underhill did not care to give her up\r\nanyhow, and he was best pleased with this plan. Mrs. Underhill imagined\r\nshe had so many things to do, as mothers of households did in those\r\ndays, and somehow she did not like to hurry Hanny about as she had\r\nMargaret. There really was not so much sewing. Joe insisted upon\r\nordering his shirts made; and Margaret had sent Ben half-a-dozen for\r\nChristmas. Then Barbara was very efficient, and, with true German\r\nthrift, improved every moment. She insisted on darning the stockings and\r\nknitting the woollen ones for winter. She was also a very neat hand at\r\nsewing.\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill had learned another lesson in her city life. There were a\r\ngood many poor people who really needed work, and she found it a much\r\nwiser plan to give them employment and pay them for it, and advise them\r\nto lay in coal and various other matters for winter. She was not a\r\nstingy woman; but she did not believe in confirming people in indolent\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nMartha came often to see them; and at times she felt almost jealous of\r\nBarbara. But she had a very pleasant home, and her stepchildren proved\r\ntractable. She did a good deal of church work, and through her Mrs.\r\nUnderhill heard of really worthy poor people.\r\n\r\nHanny wasn't a bit enthusiastic about going to West Farms.\r\n\r\n\"Janey and Polly seem so childish,\" she said to her brother Joe.\r\n\r\n\"And you are getting to be a little old woman. We don't want you to turn\r\nold and grey before your time, and have to wear spectacles and all\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can see the least little thing,\" protested the child, earnestly.\r\n\"And if I do go, can't I take my 'Queens of England' with me? I had so\r\nmany lessons that I couldn't read them as I wanted to.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret had sent the volumes to her for a birthday gift. She had just\r\nskimmed through them, and was saving them up for her leisure time.\r\nEverybody was talking about them, and recommending them to girls. Miss\r\nStrickland certainly knew how to interest readers.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe shook his head, with a sort of mirthful regret which couldn't\r\nhelp but soothe the disappointment a little.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want you to read or to study, but just run out in the sunshine\r\nand get fat. If we have such a poor pale little thing in our family,\r\npeople will wonder if I really am a good physician.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked so grave, not a bit as if he was \"making fun,\" that she gave a\r\nsort of sighing assent.\r\n\r\n\"If you get real homesick, you need not stay more than a fortnight. But\r\nthere is a good deal to learn out of doors. There are trees and wild\r\nflowers and birds. I'll come up now and then and take you out driving.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall like that. I suppose I may write to Daisy Jasper?\" she returned\r\nwith a flash of spirit. \"You see I want to know about London, and\r\nBerlin, and ever so many places, so that I won't seem like an ignoramus\r\nwhen she comes back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have all winter to learn about them.\" Then he kissed her and\r\nwent off about his own business.\r\n\r\nShe had to go and say good-bye to Stevie, who was just too sweet for\r\nanything, and Annie, and dark-eyed Daisy Hoffman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nANNABEL LEE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was queer up at West Farms, delightful, too. The house was old, with\r\na hall through the middle, and a Dutch door just as there was up at\r\nYonkers. The top part was opened in the morning, sometimes the whole\r\ndoor. The front room was the parlour, and it had not been refurnished\r\nsince Mrs. Odell came there as a bride; so it looked rather antiquated\r\nto modern eyes. The back room was the sleeping chamber; on the other\r\nside, a living room with rag carpet on the floor; then a kitchen and a\r\ngreat shed-kitchen, one side of which was piled up with wood. There was\r\na big back stoop that looked on the vegetable garden; there was an\r\norchard down below, and then cornfields and meadows.\r\n\r\nThe old house was what was called a story and a half. The pointed roof\r\nhad windows in the end, but none in the front. There were two nice big\r\nchambers upstairs, and a garret. Mr. Odell began to talk about building\r\na new house; and Mrs. Odell said the things--by which she meant the\r\ncarpets and furniture--were good enough for the old place, but they'd\r\nhave all new by the time the girls grew up, to fit the new house.\r\n\r\nMr. Odell had a peach-orchard and a quince-orchard, and two long rows of\r\ncherry-trees. Then he kept quite a herd of cows, and sold milk. He had a\r\nsplendid new barn, with two finished rooms in that, where the hands\r\nslept in summer. The old barn was devoted to the hay and the horses.\r\nThere were chickens and ducks and geese, and a pen of pigs. This summer,\r\nthey were raising three pretty calves and one little colt, who was\r\ndesperately shy. But the calves would come up to be patted, and eat out\r\nof your hand.\r\n\r\nBoth of the girls were what their mother called regular tomboys. Polly\r\nwas a few months older than the little girl, and Janey two years her\r\nsenior. They were smart too. They could wash dishes and make beds and\r\nsweep, weed in the garden, look after the poultry; and Janey could iron\r\nalmost as well as her mother. But they did love to run and whoop, and\r\ntumble in the hay, and they laughed over almost everything. They were\r\nnot great students, though they went to school regularly.\r\n\r\nA second or third cousin lived with the Odells, and did a great deal of\r\nthe housework. She was not \"real bright,\" and had some queer ways. Her\r\nimmediate relatives were dead; and the Odells had taken her from a\r\nfeeling of pity, and a fear lest at last she would be sent to the\r\npoor-house. She had an odd way of talking incoherently to herself, and\r\nnodding her head at almost everything; yet she was good-tempered and\r\nalways ready to do as she was told. But the worst was her lack of\r\nmemory; you had to tell her the same things everyday,--\"get her started\r\nin the traces,\" Mr. Odell said.\r\n\r\nMrs. Odell put a cot in the girls' room for Hanny, since there was\r\nplenty of space. And Polly seemed to find so many funny stories to tell\r\nover that Hanny fell asleep in the midst of them, and woke up in the\r\nmorning without a bit of homesick feeling. Then Mr. Odell was going to\r\nthe mill, and he took Polly and Hanny along, and they had a rather\r\namusing time.\r\n\r\nHanny was very much interested in the process, and amazed when she found\r\nhow they made the different things out of the same wheat. They used\r\n\"middlings\" for pancakes at home, when her mother was tired of\r\nbuckwheat. Not to have had griddle-cakes for breakfast would have been\r\none of the hardest trials of life for men and boys through the winter.\r\nIt warmed them up of a cold morning, and they seemed to thrive on it.\r\n\r\nMr. Odell was very willing to explain the processes to Hanny. Polly\r\nwanted to know if she thought of going into the milling business, and\r\nsuggested that she never would be big enough. Then they ran round to\r\nlook at the water-wheel and the little pond where the stream was dammed\r\nso there would be no lack of water in a dry time.\r\n\r\nThey had a drawing pattern in school just like it, except that it lacked\r\nthe broken rustic bridge a little higher up. She would take a new\r\ninterest in drawing it now.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when they reached home, and Hanny felt real hungry, though\r\nMrs. Odell declared she didn't eat more than a bird. She was glad her\r\ngirls were not such delicate little things.\r\n\r\nThey went out on the shady back stoop afterward. Janey was sewing the\r\nover-seam in a sheet that her mother wanted turned. When she had\r\nfinished, and picked out the old sewing, she was free. Then she said\r\nthey would go down to the Bristows' and have a good game of hide and\r\nseek. They always had such fun at the Bristows'.\r\n\r\nPolly brought out her basket of carpet-rags,--a peach basket nearly\r\nfull.\r\n\r\n\"I just hate to sew carpet-rags!\" she declared.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I help you?\" asked Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to be sure you _could_, if you would, and knew how to sew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I know how to sew,\" said Hanny, rather affronted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was only in fun! I'll find you a thimble. It's in my work-box\r\nthat was given me on Christmas. It's real silver, too. Mother's going to\r\nchange it when she goes to New York, only she never remembers. My\r\nfingers are so fat. Oh, Hanny, what a little mite of a hand! It'll never\r\nbe good for anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made a whole shirt myself, and I have hemstitched, and done\r\nembroidery, and I wipe dishes when I haven't too many lessons,\"\r\ninterposed the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"You can't make your own frocks,\" in a tone of triumph.\r\n\r\n\"No. Miss Cynthia Blackfan comes and does it. Can you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she can't,\" said Janey, while Polly threw her head back and\r\nlaughed, showing her strong white teeth. \"And she could no more make a\r\nshirt than she could fly. You're real smart, Hanny. I'm two years older,\r\nand I've never made a whole one. I'm going to try though, and father's\r\npromised me a dollar when I do it all by myself.\"\r\n\r\nPolly had found the thimble. It wasn't any prettier than Hanny's, though\r\nPolly begged her \"to be real careful and not lose it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you can just sew hit or miss; and then you can put in a long strip\r\nof black, 'cause there's more black than anything else. Oh, dear, I do\r\nhate to sew rags!\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of sewing do you like?\" asked Janey, in a tone that would\r\nhave been sarcastic in an older person.\r\n\r\n\"I just don't like any kind. Hanny, do _you_ know that some one has\r\ninvented a sewing-machine?\" and Polly looked up with the triumph of\r\nsuperior wisdom.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I saw it at the Institute Fair. And there's a place on\r\nBroadway where a woman sits in the window and sews. It's very queer; but\r\nwe think it doesn't sew real nice.\"\r\n\r\nPolly was for the moment nonplussed. Hanny _did_ seem to know almost\r\neverything. Then curiosity overcame her.\r\n\r\n\"Does it do really and truly sewing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes. When you come down, I'll ask Joe to take us over to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carpet-rags?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I don't know. Long straight seams, and hems and stitching.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm going to have one when I'm married. I wonder if they cost\r\nvery much!\"\r\n\r\n\"There'll be lots of things for you to do before you are married. And\r\nsome girls don't have any chance. You'll want to know how to keep\r\nhouse--\"\r\n\r\n\"I like housekeeping. You just go from one thing to another. I'll have\r\nsome one to cook and peel potatoes and all that. And we'll keep a horse\r\nand waggon, and I shall go to ride every day.\"\r\n\r\nJaney laughed. \"Just now, you had better sew carpet-rags.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll never have any rag carpets. I will give away all the old\r\nclothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll never have much of anything, nor a husband either,\r\nPolly Odell,\" said her mother. \"You talk, and leave the rags for Hanny\r\nto sew.\"\r\n\r\nPolly turned scarlet, and sewed very industriously.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to see a sewing-machine,\" began Janey, presently. \"How does it\r\ngo?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a strap around a wheel that is fast to a frame. You put your\r\nfeet on, so, and just make them go up and down after you have started\r\nthe wheel with your hand. The needle goes through, and something catches\r\nthe thread, then it goes through again, and that makes the stitch. It is\r\nvery curious.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know a good many things, don't you, Hanny?\" said Janey, admiringly.\r\n\r\nHanny coloured.\r\n\r\n\"I can beat her all out running, I know; and I'll bet a penny she can't\r\njump over the creek.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't you dare her to, Polly. Remember how you fell in. Oh, Hanny,\r\nshe was a sight to behold!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--it had been raining, and the ground was soft, so I slipped a\r\nlittle on the start. But I've done it time and again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you're a regular tomboy. Girls don't train around that way in the\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\nJaney had begun to rip out the old seam. She sighed a little, and wished\r\nshe was sewing carpet-rags. That was such easy work.\r\n\r\n\"Hanny sews a great deal faster than you,\" she said to Polly. \"See what\r\na pile she has. I will wind them up.\"\r\n\r\nIt made quite a ball, and was a little rest from the ripping, that\r\nsounded so easy and yet was tedious. But Janey persevered, and finally,\r\nafter turning about a time or two, came to the middle with a sigh of\r\nrelief. Polly had been working like a steam-engine for ten minutes, and\r\npicked out a good many long pieces, so she had a ball as large as\r\nHanny's.\r\n\r\nThen they put on their sun-bonnets, and ran down to the Bristows', which\r\nwas in the turn of the road. There were three girls,--one of nine who\r\nwas almost as big as Hanny, and the one of eleven, much taller.\r\n\r\nThey all had a good drink of buttermilk: Mrs. Bristow had just been\r\nchurning. Then they went out to the barn and played \"hide-and-seek,\" and\r\nhad a noisy, jolly time. They sat down and fanned themselves with their\r\naprons, and presently started out for some blackberries.\r\n\r\n\"There's a German settlement down below, and the children are up here\r\nevery day picking berries. You can't have anything now, unless it is\r\nplanted in your own garden. We have some lovely big blackberries, when\r\nthey get ripe.\"\r\n\r\nThen the girls ran a race. Hanny was out of breath presently, and\r\nstopped, so did little Kitty Bristow. But Julie Bristow beat in the\r\nrace. Polly wanted to run again; but the others were tired.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bristow gave Janey a beautiful, big pot-cheese to take home; and it\r\nwas just delicious.\r\n\r\nOne of the cousins from Fordham had been down. The children were all to\r\ncome up and spend the day to-morrow, and Mrs. Odell was invited to\r\nsupper.\r\n\r\nHanny felt a little lonely. If she could just see her father and Joe,\r\nand her mother and the boys. But she slept very soundly; and truly she\r\nwasn't homesick when they all came to breakfast in the morning. Janey\r\nhurried around and did her work, and they were soon ready to be off. A\r\nday meant all day, then.\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty country walk, with here and there a house, and one\r\nlittle nest of Irish emigrants. Some of the women had their wash-tubs\r\nout of doors, and were working and gossiping. Then there was St. John's\r\nCollege, with its pretty, shady grounds, and on the other side a hotel\r\nwhere the trains stopped as they went up and down. After that, you\r\nclimbed a long hill that wound a little, and on one side there was a row\r\nof beautiful, stately cherry-trees that were a sight to behold in their\r\nearly bloom and in the rich harvest of fruiting.\r\n\r\nJust at the brow of the hill stood a rather quaint house, with the end\r\nto the street. It was built against the side of the hill. You ascended a\r\nrow of stone steps, and reached the lower floor, which was a dining-room\r\nwith a wide stone-paved area, then you went up several more steps to a\r\ncheerful sunny room, and this was the kitchen. When you went upstairs\r\nagain, one side of the house was just even with the ground, and the\r\nother up a whole story. Here was a parlour, a sitting-room, several\r\nsleeping chambers; but what the little girl came to love most of all was\r\na great piazza built over the area downstairs, with a row of wide steps.\r\nWhen you were up there, you were two stories above the street, and you\r\ncould look down the long hill and all about. It was a beautiful\r\nprospect. Afterward, the little girl found some chalets in Switzerland\r\nthat made her think of this odd house that had been added to since the\r\nfirst cottage was built.\r\n\r\nThere was always a host of people in the old house. Hospitality must\r\nhave been written on its very gates, for relatives, unto the third and\r\nfourth generation, were continually made welcome: a sweet, placid\r\ngrandmother who had seen her daughter, the housemother, laid away to her\r\nsilent resting-place, and who had tried to supply her place to the\r\nchildren; the father; the aunt who took part of the care; the sons and\r\ndaughters, some of whom had grown up and married, and whose children\r\nmade glad the old home.\r\n\r\nThere was a houseful of them now; but there was a wide out-of-doors for\r\nthem to play in. A few hundred feet farther up, where the road turned\r\nand ran off to Kingsbridge, as well as to the Harlem River, stood the\r\nvillage smithy; and the Major, who had been in the War of 1812, had\r\nrelegated the business mostly to his sons. He enjoyed the coming and\r\ngoing, the bright young faces, and had a hearty welcome for the\r\nchildren, though he sometimes pretended to scold them.\r\n\r\nA queer tract of land it was, with a great rift of rock running through\r\nit where the children played house, and had parties, and occasionally\r\ntook their dinner out to eat in picnic fashion. Just beyond the strata\r\nof rock, on the good ground, stood two splendid apple-trees called\r\n\"Jersey Sweetings,\" and for nearly two summer months their bounty was\r\nthe delight of the children. Farther down, the ground sloped abruptly\r\nand settled into a pleasant orchard; then another sudden decline, and\r\nhere a pretty stream came purling through, making a tiny cascade as it\r\ntumbled over the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was deeply touched by beauty; and as they ran around she\r\nstopped now and then to drink in the shady vistas and wild nooks that\r\nseemed fairy-haunted. She had been reading a little mythology, and she\r\ncould believe in a great many things. There were places where she looked\r\nto see Pan piping on his reed, and dryads and nymphs coming out of the\r\ngroves.\r\n\r\nHow they did run and play! The air was merry with shouts and laughter.\r\nSome of them took off their shoes and stockings, and waded in the brook.\r\nAnd one of the big boys proposed that on Saturday afternoon they should\r\ngo down to the Harlem River and get some crabs and clams.\r\n\r\nThere were enough children for a second table, and that was laid in the\r\nupper kitchen. Auntie thought they must be starved; but instead they had\r\nbeen stuffed with sweet apples. Still most of them did justice to the\r\nbountiful dinner.\r\n\r\n\"This little girl looks tired out,\" said grandmother. \"I think she had\r\nbetter stay in and rest a while.\"\r\n\r\nHanny was very glad to do this. While grandmother took her nap, she went\r\nupstairs where the grown-up people were talking and sewing. She wished\r\nshe had brought her crocheting; but Polly had laughed her out of it.\r\nThen she took up a book, and was soon lost in that. It was an English\r\nnovel, as most of our novels were then, \"Time the Avenger.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a rather sad book for a little girl,\" said Cousin Jennie. \"I'll\r\nsee if I can't find you something better. You look as if you were fond\r\nof reading. You are Vermilye Underbill's little girl. And your brother\r\nGeorge has gone to California. I know him quite well, and the Yonkers\r\nfamily. I suppose he hasn't found his nugget of gold yet?\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl smiled, and said she did not think he had yet. His\r\nletters had been full of the wonderful country; and it took so long to\r\nget a letter.\r\n\r\n\"Here are some magazines with pictures and verses. Are you fond of\r\npoetry? Maybe you are a poet. You have a delicate, ethereal look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do poets have that?\" asked Hanny. \"I know a girl who writes verses and\r\nstories; but she isn't at all ethereal. I'm quite sure I couldn't write\r\nverses or anything,\" and she gave a soft laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think geniuses look quite like other people. I've seen a number\r\nof them lately. We have a genius living up the road, and ever so many\r\npeople come to see him. Some quite famous ladies.\"\r\n\r\nHanny opened her eyes very wide.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see--I think I can find one of his poems.\" She took a pile of\r\nmagazines from the top of the high old-fashioned bureau. \"Oh,\r\nyes,--though, like 'Time the Avenger,' I think it's too old for you. I\r\n'm not very fond of poetry. Here is 'Annabel Lee.'\"\r\n\r\nThen Cousin Jennie was called into the other room, where some one wanted\r\nto talk about the best way to ruffle a lawn skirt. Should the ruffles be\r\non the straight or bias?\r\n\r\nHanny read the verses over and over, and saw the city by the sea where\r\ndwelt beautiful Annabel Lee, and how her high-born kinsman, who came in\r\ngreat state in a chariot, carried her away from the one who loved her so\r\ndearly. But when, later on, she came to know and understand the poem,\r\nand the high-born kinsman had come for some of those she held most dear,\r\nshe could always go back to the vague mysterious awe that filled and\r\nthrilled her then. She sat as if in a trance until grandmother, who had\r\ntaken her nap, came and took the arm-chair beside the open window.\r\n\r\n\"Well, are you rested?\" said grandmother, cheerfully. \"I should think\r\nJaney and Polly would wear you out. It isn't a good thing for little\r\ngirls to run too much. But everything has changed since my day. Although\r\nI think they ran and played then; but they had to help work, there was\r\nso much out-of-doors work. Everything is easier now. There are so many\r\nimprovements. And, oh, how much there is to read! I'm not sure that is\r\nso good for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is very delightful,\" returned the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"If it only made people wiser!\"\r\n\r\n\"But they are growing curiously wise,\" said Hanny. \"There is the\r\ntelegraph. It seemed so queer that you could make a bit of wire talk,\r\nthat at first people didn't believe it. Uncle Faid did not when he saw\r\nit at the Fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"And people laughed about the steamboat, I remember, and the idea of\r\nrailroad trains drawn by an engine. Yes, there are a good many strange\r\nthings. And steamships crossing the ocean. There used to be\r\nsailing-vessels, and it took such a long while.\"\r\n\r\nHanny told grandmother about her friend who had gone abroad; and\r\ngrandmother, in return, told her about some Welsh ancestors who had to\r\nfly for their lives on account of being mixed up with some insurrection\r\nabout a young prince, and the stormy time they had coming over,--how\r\nthey were driven up and down the coast, and their voyage consumed two\r\nmonths. They were almost out of provisions, and suffered many hardships.\r\nSo the wisdom of the world had amounted to something.\r\n\r\nThe children came in. They were going up the road, and didn't Hanny want\r\nto join them? Mrs. Odell said they must not stay very long, she was\r\ngoing home before supper.\r\n\r\nThere was a protest about this; but Mrs. Odell said there were people\r\nand children enough without them, and she had told her husband they\r\nwould be home to supper.\r\n\r\n\"Do we go by the poet's house?\" Hanny asked as they passed the\r\ncross-road.\r\n\r\n\"The poet?\" Two or three of the children stared blankly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hanny means that Mr. Poe. Why, yes; it's the old Cromwell house. It\r\nisn't much to see. There, that little cottage.\"\r\n\r\nNo, it was not much to see,--a very bird's nest house with a great tree\r\nshading it, and a little porch at the side. A rather thin elderly woman\r\nsat sewing in a rocking-chair. She did not even look up at the children.\r\n\r\nThey were full of fun and nonsense, and presently were joined by two\r\nneighbouring girls. They went up by the old church, and then they\r\nwandered to the graveyard. It was a rather neglected place, as country\r\ngraveyards were wont to be at that time. Some red clovers were in bloom,\r\nand a few belated buttercups. The trees were rather straggling, a few\r\nmagnificent in their age. There were long-armed rose-trees that had done\r\ntheir best in the earlier season, a few wild roses, pale from growing in\r\nthe shade, and the long slender blades of grass fell about in very\r\nweakness. There were some curious inscriptions; there were places where\r\nrelatives of several of the children were buried.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hanny, come here,\" said Cousin Ann. \"That Mr. Poe's wife is buried\r\nhere. It's the Valentine plot. They're going to take her away sometime.\r\nThey're all very poor, you know. She died in the winter. People said she\r\nwas beautiful; but,\"--Ann lowered her voice,--\"they were awful poor, and\r\nit is said she didn't have comfortable things. I should hate to be so\r\npoor; shouldn't you?\"\r\n\r\nHanny shuddered. She was glad to get out in the sunshine again with her\r\nfew wild flowers in her hand.\r\n\r\nBessie Valentine made them come in and have a chunk of cake, and it was\r\na chunk indeed. Those who liked had a glass of buttermilk.\r\n\r\nCousin Jennie had gone up to the corner to look for them. Hanny espied\r\nher, and ran forward.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she cried, \"I've seen the house where Mr. Poe lives. And we went\r\nin the graveyard. Who was the other lady sitting on the porch?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was Mrs. Clemm. I go up there to borrow books; and I like Mr. Poe,\r\nonly--well, he is rather unfortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was she so beautiful?\" asked the child, irrelevantly.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Poe? Yes; I think she must have been. She looked like a small\r\nwhite wraith--do you know what a wraith is?\" smilingly.\r\n\r\n\"A kind of ghost. And were they very poor?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a sad story. I think they were proud as well, for any one would\r\nhave come in and done any needed thing. They had friends in the city who\r\nused to visit them. Mrs. Clemm was Mrs. Poe's mother and the poet's\r\naunt; and it is said Annabel Lee means his wife. It's a wild, musical\r\nthing. Every story or poem of his has a curious ghostly sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--the high-born kinsman--\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl's eyes were vague and puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"You can't understand it. Poets say queer things. I'm not fond of\r\npoetry, only here and there. And the stories make you shiver. You\r\nwouldn't like them. He has all sorts of books, and he is very generous\r\nwith them. We've planned that you are to come up and stay a week with\r\nus. Some of the folks are going away, and there will be plenty of room.\"\r\n\r\nHanny squeezed her hand. The throng of children ran over the grassy path\r\nfrom the shop; and they all began to clamour that Polly and Janey\r\nshould come up Saturday and go crabbing with them.\r\n\r\nMrs. Odell said she'd see, if they could get their work done in time.\r\n\r\nThere was a hubbub of good-byes, and the small cavalcade started down\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWITH A POET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city by the sea sung itself in Hanny's brain. The sweet, young,\r\nbeautiful wife, ruthlessly torn away, was somewhere in space, among the\r\nstars perhaps, and not in the old graveyard. She was floating on and on\r\namidst all lovely things and divine fragrances. She could never grow\r\nold; she would never want for anything. Ah, would she not want for the\r\nmother and the poet who loved her?\r\n\r\nAn incident that had moved her strongly only a few weeks before, was a\r\nstrange bit of reminiscence that could hardly be called a story. Ben had\r\nbrought home a volume of De Quincey, and \"Suspiria de Profundis\" was\r\namong the papers. The others were too intellectual to interest her; but\r\nthe touching, tender, immeasurable longing for the little sister gone\r\nout of life, filled her inmost soul with an emotion so sacred she could\r\nnot talk it over with any one. This was akin to it.\r\n\r\nYet Hanny did not live in the clouds or in vague memories all the time.\r\nHer father drove up the next day, and found she was not homesick; and\r\nher mother was coming up the next week to spend the day; and everybody\r\nwas well. She had a great deal to tell him; and she seemed very merry.\r\nHe wasn't quite sure about the crabbing expedition; but Mrs. Odell said\r\nthere wasn't a mite of danger, for some of the big boys always went\r\nalong; and that it was a regular frolic for the children.\r\n\r\nSo Saturday they put on their oldest clothes. Hanny wore an outgrown\r\nfrock of Polly's. Mr. Odell said he would drive them down to the river,\r\nwhich would save half the walk. He had some business in that direction.\r\n\r\nHe had the farm-waggon, and put some hay in the bottom, though he\r\ninsisted Hanny should sit on the seat with him. They stopped at Fordham,\r\nand took in another relay; and the children were wild with the\r\nunreasoning gladness of youth. Mr. Odell was in an uncommon good-humour,\r\nand took them down the river quite a distance, to High Bridge, and then\r\nup again, when they espied the boys and baskets and the net, which had a\r\nlong handle and looked to Hanny like a butterfly-net, only larger.\r\n\r\nA motley crew they were. The boys had their trousers rolled above their\r\nknees, and some of the girls took off their shoes and stockings and\r\nwaded about in the wet, sedgy grass. There was a little dock where the\r\nboats were tied; and soon two of them were loosened and filled up with a\r\njolly crew. Big, cheerful Cousin Ben took charge of the little girl, and\r\nwould not allow the others to frighten her. Ann was quite a famous hand\r\non these expeditions.\r\n\r\nThey rowed out a short distance, and then began business. Oh, the\r\nshrieks and laughter that came from the other boat, when some one dipped\r\nup two hands full of water and dashed it over the others. And it is\r\nstrange how much you can make your hands hold at such a time. Hanny was\r\nglad she was not in that boat, when they rocked it up and down. But most\r\nof the children could swim, and they were not in the channel.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!\" exclaimed Cousin Ann, and the net was held out in a twinkling,\r\nAnn drew up a great green fellow with a frightful lot of legs, and he\r\ndropped in the net. They dumped him into a basket, and covered him with\r\na piece of old fish-net; and the more he struggled to get out, the more\r\nhe entangled himself. Hanny felt rather glad he was not down her end of\r\nthe boat.\r\n\r\nThey had brilliant luck for a little while. Then the other boat shifted\r\nabout; they had not caught a single crab, and there were loud murmurs of\r\ndiscontent. The others had the best place.\r\n\r\n\"You make such a racket you frighten them away,\" said Ben.\r\n\r\n\"Can they hear?\" asked Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"I think about everything in this world can see and hear in some\r\nfashion.\"\r\n\r\nThey certainly were dreadful looking. The laughter and the exclamations,\r\nthe disappointment at losing one, the funny conundrums the children\r\npropounded to one another, and the limp appearance of the voyagers,\r\npartly made amends for the sudden fright every time the great sprawling\r\nthings came up. Hanny would not even undertake the capture of one.\r\n\r\nThe crabs grew wise presently. Not one of them could be aroused to the\r\nfaintest curiosity concerning bait. Ben's boat had nineteen, the other\r\neleven. They rowed up to the little dock, and managed to get them all in\r\none basket. Jack showed Hanny how you could take hold of a crab, and\r\nrender him helpless. It certainly did look funny to see him struggling\r\nwith all his might and main, and his numerous legs. The two front ones\r\nwere very fierce.\r\n\r\n\"He could give you an awful pinch with them,\" said Jack; and he made\r\nbelieve fling him at a group of girls, who scattered pellmell.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the legs are oars, and help him swim,\" said Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"And help him grab his prey. He's a sort of savage fellow, and lives on\r\nsmaller folks.\"\r\n\r\nThen Ben and Jack went to dig for clams. There were very nice clam and\r\noyster beds along the river then. There were not many people to disturb\r\nthem, and no sewage to starve them out.\r\n\r\nHanny thought planting oysters a very funny idea. They were put in their\r\nbeds like other babies.\r\n\r\nThe boys, and some of the girls, picked up the clams, until they had a\r\nhalf-bushel basket full. Tony Creese, the black man who did odd jobs,\r\nwas to drive down for the \"freight;\" but he seemed in no hurry. Some of\r\nthe boys went in swimming; and Janey Odell did wish she had brought\r\nanother frock along. She could swim very well. They waded instead. Ben\r\nwalked up to a little bank that, having lain in the sun all day, was\r\nwarm and dry, and stretched himself out. Ann was too big to go \"larking\"\r\nabout with the girls, so she and Hanny, and one or two others, sat down\r\non the soft, sunburned turf.\r\n\r\nHow beautiful it all was! The sun was going down behind the New Jersey\r\nhills. The little rise of ground between this and the Hudson shut out\r\nthe river; but it could not shut out the amethystine splendour. Back of\r\nit all was heaven, to the child's faith. Miss Lois and her sister were\r\nthere, and old Mr. Bounett, and the poet's young wife, and ever so many\r\nothers. It was only the other side of the clouds, with their scarlet and\r\ngold and green battlements. She could see the ships sailing into port.\r\nShe recalled \"Pilgrim's Progress,\" and Christiana going across. In that\r\nmoment of ecstasy she could have gone herself.\r\n\r\nTony came down the road singing \"Oh, Susannah;\" Ben answered \"Hillo!\"\r\nand shook himself like a great bear. The two baskets were put into the\r\nwaggon.\r\n\r\n\"Now you girls who are too delicate for a long walk, or too much worn\r\nout by your day's toil, had better hop in. Ann, you go and keep an eye\r\non Hanny. Now who else?\"\r\n\r\nThey were all pretty tired with their racing about, and the three\r\nsmallest ones were picked out, as there was but one horse. The others\r\nformed the rear-guard, and marched on behind, with their arms about\r\neach other. They were too tired for even the tempting game of \"tag,\" or\r\nthe ambition of running races.\r\n\r\nMr. Odell was waiting at the uncle's, having come around the other way.\r\nSupper was ready; but he thought they had better be \"gettin' on,\" as\r\nmother would wait supper for them.\r\n\r\nHanny was very tired, and went to bed immediately after the meal.\r\n\r\nThey had some splendid clam-fritters for breakfast. Ben had proposed to\r\ndivide the crabs; but Mr. Odell reckoned, \"He'd go crabbing the first\r\nleisure day,\" and was satisfied with part of the clams.\r\n\r\nAnd then, unexpected delight, Stephen and Dolly and the two babies came\r\nup to dinner. Little Stevie captured everybody, he was so merry and\r\ncunning; and Polly wished they could keep him.\r\n\r\n\"When he gets to be a big boy, and has a school vacation, I'll be very\r\nglad to send him up, I dare say,\" was the response.\r\n\r\n\"But, dear me, we'll be big too,\" said Polly; \"and it won't be any fun.\"\r\n\r\nDolly told her little sister-in-law all the news, and what everybody was\r\ndoing. It seemed as if she had been away so long. Mother had spent a day\r\nwith Martha, which she had been promising to do ever since Martha was\r\nmarried.\r\n\r\nThe little girl almost wanted to go home with them; but no one invited\r\nher, and she would not have been so silly or ungracious as to plead\r\nhomesickness, for she really wasn't homesick a bit.\r\n\r\nThen, on Tuesday, Joe came up with a letter from Daisy, who had gone to\r\nsome German baths, and was drinking water twice as horrid as that at\r\nSaratoga. The things you had to eat were so very queer; but the music\r\neverywhere was perfectly bewitching. Everything was so different. She\r\nwas taking lessons of a Fräulein, and had to talk German at the table.\r\nThey had been through several churches, and one picture gallery that was\r\nmagnificent. A little withered-up old German was giving her some\r\npainting lessons. If Hanny could only be there, she would be quite\r\ncontent; yet she did think she loved America best.\r\n\r\nHanny was so delighted that her eyes shone, and her cheeks were pink as\r\na rose-leaf.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Odell said she could notice that her appetite was better, and\r\nshe was doing her best to fat her up a little, and make her look like a\r\ncountry girl.\r\n\r\nMr. Odell took her about with him when he could. There were so many\r\nbeautiful places up and down the valley of the Bronx. They went up to\r\nWhite Plains, and took everybody by surprise. Grandmother up there was\r\nquite feeble now.\r\n\r\nThen it happened, rather oddly, that when Cousin Jennie came down for\r\nher, as there was no one scarcely at Fordham but the regular family,\r\nMrs. Odell was going to have a houseful of relatives from the West. She\r\njust wished they had their new house at such times as these. She could\r\nmake a bed on the floor for Janey and Polly, and that would give her two\r\nspare rooms.\r\n\r\nThe girls didn't feel so badly, as there were two Western cousins of\r\ntheir age, and they would bring them up to Fordham.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was not at all tired of her pleasant hosts; but there\r\nwas a romantic side to the coming visit that she could not talk over\r\nwith Polly and Janey; and she was most famished for reading, as the\r\nOdells were not of the intellectual sort. Mrs. Odell didn't like the\r\nchildren to handle her parlour books, in their red morocco bindings,\r\nthat were spread around on the centre-table.\r\n\r\nHanny's favourite place at the Fordham house was up on the high piazza.\r\nTo be sure, it was sunny in the morning; but then Doctor Joe said\r\nsunshine was good for her, and one corner soon grew shady. There was\r\nsome one passing up and down continually: the priests from St. John's\r\nCollege, in their long black coats and queer hats, generally reading as\r\nthey walked; the labourers who worked on the railroad; the people going\r\nto the station; and the girls out calling in the afternoons in their\r\npretty white gowns. There was no Jerome Park for stylish driving.\r\nIndeed, it was a plain little country village, and most of the life\r\ncentred about the corner grocery and the blacksmith shop, where men\r\ntalked politics and the discovery of California, and discussed the\r\nmerits of the heroes of the Mexican War.\r\n\r\nShe sewed some patchwork for Cousin Jennie, who was making several\r\nbed-quilts, and who had a lover,--a tall, bright-eyed young man who\r\ndrove a very handsome horse. Hanny felt quite wise on the subject of\r\nlovers; and though no one said anything special, she understood what the\r\npreparations meant.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" Cousin Jennie said the next afternoon, \"I am going up to Mr.\r\nPoe's, to return some books and get others. Will you go along?\"\r\n\r\nHanny was very glad. She had seen Mr. N. P. Willis and General Morris,\r\nand some others, on the street; but that wasn't like going to their\r\nhouses. The dead young wife lent him a glamour of romance, to her\r\ngirlish imagination.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clemm sat on the farther end of the porch. It almost seemed as if\r\nshe had not stirred since Hanny caught the first glimpse of her. She\r\nrose, a tall, rather thin woman with a sad, quiet face and a grave\r\nsmile; and the two had a little chat.\r\n\r\nThere was no hall to the house, at least the door opened into the front\r\nroom. A half closet stood at one side of the chimney, piled with books\r\nand papers, an old sofa and some chairs, a table in the centre, strewn\r\nwith pamphlets and writing-materials, and the poet sitting beside it in\r\na melancholy pose, marking passages in a book.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up and spoke. The little girl had an impression of a pallid\r\nface framed in dark, tumbled hair, and luminous eyes that seemed to be\r\nof some other world in their abstracted light.\r\n\r\n\"You are quite welcome to any of the books, as you well know,\" said the\r\npoet. \"I am glad to have some one interested in them.\"\r\n\r\nThen the white hand went on turning pages and making notes. The little\r\ngirl stood by the window, almost expecting the frail ghost to walk down\r\nfrom the graveyard and enter the door again. Later on, she understood\r\nthe impression of weirdness, the almost ghostly stillness of the room;\r\nand she found herself thinking over the poem that had so impressed her.\r\n\r\nFordham, in those days, was neither poetical nor intellectual. That a\r\nman should starve on writing poetry, when there was other work to be\r\ndone in the world, seemed rather absurd. In some of the centres,\r\nliterature was becoming an honourable employment; but country places had\r\nnot emerged from the twilight of respect for brawn rather than brain.\r\n\r\nJennie made her selections, and expressed her obligation. The poet\r\nnodded absently.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clemm rose, as they emerged from the door, and walked to the end of\r\nthe porch with them. There was something wonderfully pathetic in the\r\ncare-worn face, the reticent air, and gentle voice.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you have a few eggs to spare,\" she asked, in a hesitating\r\nmanner. \"My poor Edgar's appetite is so wretched. He has had a bad\r\nspell, and eats next to nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I can find you half-a-dozen, I know. Our hens are afflicted a\r\nlittle with summer laziness,\" and Jennie smiled. \"We have been baking\r\nto-day, and I wish you would accept a loaf of bread. I'll send this\r\nlittle cousin up with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't trouble! I will come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be glad to do it,\" said Hanny, with a gentle eagerness.\r\n\r\nCousin Jennie put the bread and the eggs,--she found seven,--and part of\r\na cake, in a little basket, and said, \"Run along, Little Red Riding\r\nHood. There are no wolves to catch you.\"\r\n\r\nThey teased Cousin Jennie a little because the tall young man with\r\nbright eyes was named Woolf.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clemm received the little girl's parcel with her usual quiet air,\r\nand thanked her for coming. And before she could hunt up her ever-scanty\r\npurse the child had said Good-evening, and vanished.\r\n\r\nHanny heard the \"spells\" rather rudely explained a day or two after, and\r\nunderstood the melancholy shadow that hung about the house. People were\r\nnot any more delicate in gossiping about their neighbour's short-comings\r\nthen than now, when all the little faults and frailties of heroes are\r\nparaded to the public gaze and comment.\r\n\r\nBut the exquisite care with which the mother watched over the son of her\r\nheart, made her one of the little girl's heroines later on, when she\r\ncould fully appreciate the tender solicitude that tried to shield him\r\nand save him from temptation, when possible, bearing her burthen with\r\nsuch heroic dignity that she was fain to persuade her own soul that she\r\ncovered it from critical eyes. When one woman suffers bravely to the\r\ndeath, amid untold privation, and another takes up the dropped burthen\r\nwith a devotion no anxiety can wear out, is it not proof that there must\r\nhave been some charm in the poet seen more clearly by those who loved\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nThere was a new book by Miss Macintosh among those they had brought\r\nhome; and this Hanny devoured eagerly, sitting on her high perch, while\r\nthe rest were busy in the household routine. In the afternoon, she read\r\naloud while the others sewed. Sometimes the Major came in to listen; but\r\nhe thought there were no novels written nowadays like \"The Mysteries of\r\nUdolpho,\" \"The Children of the Abbey,\" and \"The Vicar of Wakefield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the little girl, \"isn't this funny! We have the first volume\r\nof 'The Grumbler' and the second of 'The Grandfather.' I don't believe I\r\ncan piece them together,\" with a bright, mirthful expression.\r\n\r\n\"And I picked those up myself. No; we are interested in the 'Grumbler'\r\nnow and must know what became of him.\"\r\n\r\nThey were English novels by a Miss Pickering, long since forgotten,\r\nwhile less worthy ones are remembered.\r\n\r\n\"We'll walk up after supper and change them,\" continued Cousin Jennie.\r\n\r\nBut visitors came in shortly afterward to stay to supper. People were\r\nnot specially invited then; and the hostess did not expect to prepare a\r\nfeast on ordinary occasions. So Jennie said Hanny might go up alone, if\r\nshe didn't mind.\r\n\r\nShe started gladly, yet a sense of diffidence oppressed her as she stood\r\nat the door, a half guilty consciousness, as if she had no right to the\r\nsecret Mrs. Clemm was trying so assiduously to hide.\r\n\r\nThe poet was pacing up and down the room; but his pallid face and\r\nstrange, shining eyes seemed looking out from some other world. Mrs.\r\nClemm sat by the window with a magazine in her hand.\r\n\r\nHanny preferred her request timidly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come in and hunt them up. Your cousin is quite welcome to anything.\r\nThen there are some upstairs, though I brought down that pile over in\r\nthe corner this very morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe corner looked attractive. Hanny went thither, and knelt down on the\r\nchecked matting. There were two books of engravings containing portraits\r\nof famous people, some old volumes of verse, some new ones, and\r\nmagazines.\r\n\r\nThe volumes she wanted were not among them. But she exhumed something\r\nelse that made her forget the slight, nervous man pacing up and down,\r\nand the woman at the window. Turning the leaves of an old novel that had\r\nlost one cover, she came across the name of one of her heroes, \"Richard\r\nof the Lion Heart.\" She had a passion, just then, for English history.\r\nAnd there was Bulwer's \"White Rose of England,\" in paper covers with a\r\nHarper imprint.\r\n\r\n\"Could I take these beside?\" she asked, with some hesitation.\r\n\r\nHe glanced over at them as he came to that end of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Those old novels? Yes. Do they let you read novels?\"\r\n\r\n\"I read almost anything,\" and Hanny glanced up with rising colour. \"But\r\nthere are not so many books up here--I live in New York,\" she added, by\r\nway of explanation.\r\n\r\nA half smile crossed his face, but its melancholy haunted the little\r\ngirl long afterward.\r\n\r\nThen she went over to the closet, and soon found her missing volumes,\r\nand uttered her gentle Good-afternoon. Mrs. Clemm had folded her sewing,\r\nand came out on the porch where the water-pail stood empty, so she\r\nstarted to the well.\r\n\r\n\"Please thank your cousin for her kindness,\" she said in a soft tone. \"I\r\nam glad she is fond of books.\"\r\n\r\nThe modern realistic school, or even the analytic school, would flout\r\nMadame Cottin's old novel of \"The Saracen\" to-day. Perhaps in the year\r\ntwo thousand the novels of to-day will be wondered at. The next morning,\r\nthe little girl was up in her eyrie in the corner of the porch, and\r\nbegan her story. She was deeply interested in the Crusaders as well.\r\nRichard, Saladin, and his noble and knightly brother Melek held her\r\nspell-bound. She let the patchwork lie unheeded.\r\n\r\nQueen Joan, Richard's sister, beautiful and unfortunate in her marriage,\r\nalmost a prisoner for years, rescued and taken to the Holy Land in\r\ncompany with Berengaria, and treated with Oriental suavity and honour,\r\nand loved by Melek Adel, indeed, almost married to him, though history\r\nconsiders it only as one of the many feints of Eastern diplomacy, roused\r\nall Hanny's youthful ardour. And Saladin's young nephew, taking\r\nknighthood at Richard's hands on Easter morning, was so striking a\r\npicture that the child could not understand why Turks and Christians\r\nshould be bitter enemies, when friendships like this could be cemented,\r\nand apparently appreciated by men of such qualities.\r\n\r\nShe lost interest in the \"Grumbler,\" and I am afraid her mind wandered\r\nas she read aloud. She was really glad that for several days there were\r\nno children to play with. She sat out of doors, and was pretty sure that\r\nwould answer Doctor Joe's requirements; and the Major took her out\r\ndriving, but she smuggled in her book. She was not quite so pale, though\r\nthat might have been due to sun-burn.\r\n\r\nShe had just finished her enchanting story one morning, and was glancing\r\nidly down the hill, watching the toilers who bent over as if they were\r\ncarrying heavy loads, or drawing something behind them. Physical culture\r\nhad not yet been applied to the fine art of walking.\r\n\r\nA barouche, drawn by two nodding horses, came slowly along. There were\r\nfour ladies in it; but one especially attracted the child. She wore a\r\ngown of softest cerulean blue, a bonnet of blue crape with delicate pink\r\nroses, and a large bow of airy tulle tied under her chin. Her long\r\nringlets, the fashion of the day, drooped about her lovely face, that\r\nsmiled and dimpled as she talked. Her hands were daintily gloved, and\r\none held her parasol up high so she could glance about. Hanny was quite\r\nsure she espied her, for her companion leaned out and looked also.\r\n\r\nShe left the child in a daze as she went by. Hanny had a secret,\r\nexultant consciousness that she had seen her ideal poet; then she smiled\r\nand wondered if she could write poems. Dolly was quite as pretty, but\r\nshe couldn't; and Margaret was handsomer. She could not quite associate\r\nthe sad, abstracted man up the road with \"Annabel Lee.\" What a puzzle it\r\nall was!\r\n\r\nShe went downstairs presently, and was sitting on the area steps\r\nwatching Cousin Jennie iron, when the tall figure in her shabby black\r\nhat and veil, which she invariably wore, came up the outer steps. Hanny\r\nran to open the gate.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clemm was always quietly dignified. It was the intangible good\r\nbreeding that distinguished her from the ordinary country-folk. She had\r\na small tin kettle in her hand, and her manner was apologetic.\r\n\r\n\"They had some unexpected visitors from the city, dear friends of\r\nEddie's\" (she oftener called him that than any other name, and she often\r\nsaid \"My poor dear Eddie!\"). \"Could they spare her some milk, and a few\r\neggs? They had no milk at the store.\"\r\n\r\n\"With pleasure,\" said Jennie, who went to the milk-room, and cast a\r\nglance around to see if there was not something else that would help out\r\nthe feast.\r\n\r\nThe little girl wanted to ask some questions, but she hesitated from\r\ndiffidence.\r\n\r\nShe wondered afterward how the quiet, almost listless woman could\r\nconcoct dainty feasts for these illustrious people out of her poverty;\r\nfor they were illustrious in their day. Were the wit and poesy and\r\nknowledge the successive desserts, and bright gossip the sparkle of the\r\nBarmecide wine? She thought of the little cottage, when she read of\r\nMadame Scarron among the French wits.\r\n\r\nShe described them to Cousin Jennie when the tall black figure was going\r\nslowly up the road.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they have a good many visitors,\" said Jennie. \"They did last\r\nsummer, when poor Mrs. Poe was alive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was _she_ very beautiful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, child, beauty isn't everything!\" and Jennie smiled. \"Yes; it was\r\nsaid she was. But she was so thin and pale. She used to sit out there on\r\nthe porch, wrapped in a white shawl, with his arm about her, or her head\r\nresting on his shoulder. You see no one knew much about them then, and\r\nthey kept so to themselves. Then there is his unfortunate habit, that\r\nyou cannot help feeling ought not to belong to a person of his\r\nintelligence. It is a great pity.\"\r\n\r\nHanny sighed. She was to know a great deal more about the world later\r\non, and the appreciation that was spread as a garment about the poet\r\nwhen his life's fitful fever ended.\r\n\r\nThere was an influx of quite elderly people one afternoon; and Hanny,\r\ngathering up some books, stole up to the little cottage, quite assured\r\nno one would need her, or even miss her.\r\n\r\nThe corner of books had been \"cleared up.\" In the wide fireplace, there\r\nwas a jar of feathery asparagus, and on the table a vase of flowers.\r\nThere were a number of pictures, Hanny noticed. She had hardly glanced\r\nabout the room before,--the plain, low-ceiled room to which people were\r\nto make pilgrimages as time went on.\r\n\r\nThe poet sat by the table in a dreamy, indolent mood.\r\n\r\n\"Did you find what you wanted the other day?\" he asked gently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! And I have read 'The Saracen.' It interested me so, I couldn't\r\nleave it a moment. I didn't want to like Saladin so much; but I had to.\r\nBut I shall never give up Richard.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled a little at that, kindly, cordially, and her heart warmed to\r\nhim. The pervasive eyes were so deep and beautiful! In spite of the\r\npallor and attenuation, the face had a rare charm.\r\n\r\n\"So Richard is your hero? Well, you will doubtless change your heroes a\r\ngood many times before you get through with life. I think I had a boy's\r\nfancy for Saladin once. Yet heroes come to be quite common-place people\r\nafter all. I wonder if I have any more that you would like?\"\r\n\r\nHanny said they had several books yet, and she was going down to West\r\nFarms in a few days. She wanted to finish \"The White Rose of England.\"\r\n\r\n\"History in romance,--I dare say that suits young people best.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood in a sort of vague uncertainty.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" in a voice of suggestive inquiry, as if she might ask him\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she cried, summoning all her courage, and flushing as she did so,\r\n\"will you please tell me who the pretty lady in blue was, who came up\r\nthe other day in the carriage? She looked like a poet!\"\r\n\r\nHe did laugh then, softly, as if laughing was a little strange.\r\n\r\n\"Is that your idea of a poet? Well, she _is_ one,--an airy, light-winged\r\npoet with dainty conceits, and a charming woman, too. I must tell her\r\nshe captured you at sight. That is Frances Sargent Osgood. And beside\r\nher sat Mrs. Gove Nichols, one of the new lights. Stay, I think I can\r\nfind a poem or two of Fanny Osgood's for you.\"\r\n\r\nHe hunted up two or three magazines. Hanny sat down on the door-sill; it\r\nwas so softly, so enchantingly bright out-of-doors, and the room a\r\nlittle gloomy. She wanted to have a glimpse of sunshine, for Mrs. Osgood\r\nlooked as if she belonged to the brighter world.\r\n\r\nThey were dainty and bright. One was set to music afterward; and the\r\nlittle girl learned to sing it very prettily:--\r\n\r\n    \"I've something sweet to tell you,\r\n      And the secret you must keep,\r\n    For remember, if it isn't night,\r\n      I'm talking in my sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThen they talked about poetry. I dare say he was amused at a little girl\r\nwhose ideal poem was \"Genevieve,\" by Coleridge, and who knew\r\n\"Christobel,\" \"The Ancient Mariner,\" and \"The Lady of the Lake\" half by\r\nheart. When, in her young womanhood, she read some of his sharp,\r\nscathing criticisms, she wondered at his sweetness that afternoon. With\r\na little more courage, she would have asked him what was really meant by\r\n\"the high-born kinsman;\" but she did not know as it was quite proper to\r\ntalk to him about his own verses.\r\n\r\nThe wood-robins were singing in the tall trees, and the sun made dancing\r\nshadows on the stoop that was always clean as a floor. Mrs. Clemm\r\nbrought her splint rocker out, and begged her to try it, and asked after\r\nthe cousins, sending thanks for the cake that she had found in her\r\nbasket, and the pot-cheese that had proved such a treat to her visitors.\r\n\r\nShe thanked Mrs. Clemm prettily for the chair, but said she must go\r\nhome. The poet nodded. He had taken up his pen then, and she wondered\r\nwhat the spell was like that inspired a poem.\r\n\r\nThe next forenoon, they saw Mr. Poe going down to the station. Cousin\r\nJennie shook her head; and the stout old Major said, \"It was a pity Mrs.\r\nClemm couldn't keep him at home steadily.\"\r\n\r\nShe was never to see him again; but when she heard of his tragic death,\r\nher heart ached for the poor desolate mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF TERRORS\r\n\r\n\r\nThey all admitted that Hanny had improved a good deal. She seemed to\r\nhave grown every way. Her mother was sure she must let her skirts down;\r\nand her last winter's frocks were too tight about the shoulders, and too\r\nshort in the sleeves. She had absolutely gained five pounds, and her\r\nlittle face had rounded out. But still she was smaller than most girls\r\nof her age.\r\n\r\nShe had so much to talk about that her mother said she was a regular\r\nlittle gossip. Her father liked to hear about grandmother and the\r\nkindly, large-hearted Major. She had found out that when grandmother was\r\na young girl her name was Hannah Underhill, now it was Horton. So many\r\nelderly people had been visiting at Fordham, and her father knew most of\r\nthem. But Ben and Doctor Joe were interested in the poet Poe; Joe knew\r\nmore about him than he confessed to his little sister.\r\n\r\nOh, how glad she was to get back to school! There were so many things to\r\nlearn. But Dolly had to have her one Saturday; and Mrs. French came over\r\nand took her to the house Beautiful. Ben was quite in love with Mrs.\r\nFrench. And now they were filling up the conservatory for winter\r\nblooming; and Hanny wished _they_ could have some house-flowers. Her\r\nmother had hydrangeas and an oleander; but they were put in the end of\r\nthe stable for winter.\r\n\r\nNow and then she went up to Margaret's to stay all night. Daisy was\r\ngrowing to be almost as lovely as Stevie had been; and though she did\r\nnot suggest Daisy Jasper, the name always recalled her dear friend. And\r\nStevie was quite a big boy. He was getting some rough ways, too, and\r\nwanted to drive Hanny about for a horse, just as he did papa.\r\nGreat-grandmother Van Kortland had knit him some beautiful horse-lines.\r\n\r\nAnd Annie was such a sweet little thing! Stevie wished she was a little\r\nbrother, \"'tause dirls ain't no dood,\" he said. \"You'm dot to be so\r\ntareful.\" He talked quite crooked, and could not pronounce \"g\" at all.\r\nHe said \"umbebella\" and \"peaapoket\" and \"tea-tettletel.\" Philadelphia\r\nalways floored him. But then he had been Hanny's first love, and she\r\ncould never forget the Christmas morning when he came.\r\n\r\nThere had been another exciting matter as well, and this was a\r\npresidential election. Zachary Taylor, Old Rough and Ready, as he was\r\ncalled, had become a great hero to her. She found that he had served\r\ngallantly in the War of 1812, fought against the mighty Tecumseh, and\r\nbeen in the Black Hawk War, beside all the late Mexican engagements,\r\nwhere he had so distinguished himself. At the nomination, she had been a\r\nlittle sorry to have her old favourite Harry Clay superseded, and\r\nGeneral Scott was a war-veteran as well. Then there had been famous\r\nDaniel Webster, whose speeches were the favourite of school-boys, though\r\nthey had not banished Patrick Henry. But the real race was between Cass,\r\nVan Buren, Charles Francis Adams and himself; and Old Rough and Ready\r\nwon. She wore a rough-and-ready straw bonnet this fall; all the girls\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nMargaret agitated the school question again. Hanny ought to be making\r\nsome useful friends, and though the \"First Avenue and First Street girls\r\nmight be very nice--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" exclaimed Mrs. Underhill. \"She's too little to be sent so\r\nfar off. And I don't want any lovers put in her head this many a year.\"\r\n\r\nMargaret was getting to be rather aristocratic. She kept her whole house\r\nnow, and had a maid-servant beside the coloured \"boy.\" Some stylish\r\npeople were building up-town. Dr. Hoffman had a good many friends, and\r\nhe was very proud of his handsome wife. But Mrs. Underhill sometimes\r\nsaid, in the bosom of her family, that Margaret \"put on airs.\"\r\n\r\nHanny was well satisfied, and found a great many things to learn at Mrs.\r\nCraven's.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Theodore Whitney came home, and published a book of travel\r\nletters. And another young man, one Bayard Taylor, had been abroad and\r\nseen all of Europe with knapsack and staff, and had published his \"Views\r\nAfoot.\" Ben was so interested. He often stopped at the Whitneys for\r\nsupper and a talk.\r\n\r\nNora grew like a weed, and developed a good deal of musical ability.\r\nThey had a steady servant now; and Mrs. Whitney was more \"intellectual\"\r\nthan ever, and beginning to be proud of Delia's stories. She was\r\ngenerally paid for them; although young writers of that day were\r\nsatisfied with the chance of being heard of, and read. She was getting\r\nquite a library together, and had her corner of the back parlour, which\r\nMr. Theodore took possession of at once. He had brought home some fine\r\nengravings and studies, and half-a-dozen different \"Virgins.\" The aspect\r\nof the rooms changed altogether. Delia began to cultivate quite a\r\n\"circle.\"\r\n\r\nShe and Ben were splendid comrades. She had plans for going abroad also;\r\nand he entered into them with great zeal. She \"didn't suppose she could\r\npay her way like The.; but she was saving up her money for that object.\"\r\nAunt Clem was real good to her; and when her quarterly allowance was\r\npaid she often dropped five dollars into Dele's bank.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know how much there is, and I am not going to open it under two\r\nyears. Of course a woman couldn't take matters as Bayard Taylor did; but\r\nif she was economical and found cheap places! I do wonder if she could\r\ngo alone?\"\r\n\r\nTourists' parties had not been invented, though men occasionally\r\nclubbed together and obtained accommodations more cheaply.\r\n\r\n\"Two years,\" returned Ben, musingly.\r\n\r\nDele was certainly growing prettier. Her hair wasn't even Titian colour\r\nnow, but a decided bright brown, and the curly roughness seemed just to\r\nsuit her. Then the freckles were disappearing. He didn't know as\r\nfreckles spoiled any one's complexion when it had that peachy softness\r\nand the kind of creamy look. If her mouth was wide, it had some pretty\r\ncurves, and her teeth were beautiful. A Grecian nose would take all the\r\npiquancy out of her face.\r\n\r\n\"It may be a little more than two years,\" considered Delia, \"and The.\r\nmay start off again. Oh, I'm pretty sure to go some time!\"\r\n\r\n\"I've quite made up _my_ mind to go some time,\" Ben announced gravely,\r\nthen laughed.\r\n\r\n\"It would be such fun to go together,\" said Dele, in her harum-scarum\r\nfashion, without a thought of any future contingency. \"I'll try to make\r\nThe. wait until I get rich enough.\"\r\n\r\nBen went home thinking what rare fun it would be to travel with some one\r\nwho saw the comical side of everything, and who could extract pleasure\r\nstraight along, as a bee could gather up honey. He enjoyed the fun\r\nmightily, but he could not always bring it to pass. Joe and Jim had a\r\nhumourous side; but John had always been grave and steady-going. Ben\r\nwanted some one to stir up the spirit of fun, and then he did his best\r\nto keep it going. But he always had so much of the past seething in his\r\nbrain. The world had such a wonderful history! He was almost afraid that\r\nnow, when there was no war on hand, only Indian skirmishes, it would\r\ngrow common-place. There were no breathless romances about it, as there\r\nwere about Europe and Asia, where such conquerors as Tamerlane, Genghis\r\nKhan, Alexander and Philip and Attila, Charlemagne and Napoleon had\r\nstalked across the world as it was known then. Not that Ben had any\r\nsoldierly ambitions, but to youth everyday plodding along seems\r\nunheroic.\r\n\r\nThe pleasant neighbourhood-life went on, though it must be confessed\r\nthat Hanny often longed for Daisy Jasper. Mr. Jasper had returned; and\r\nthe plan was now that the others might stay abroad two or three years.\r\nDaisy had improved wonderfully at the baths. They would spend the winter\r\nat Naples, and go back to Germany in the summer. Daisy was taking\r\nlessons in music and painting and Italian.\r\n\r\nShe wrote about herself to Hanny. She only practised an hour a day, and\r\ncould stand it very well. Everything was so queer and foreign, though\r\noften very beautiful. But the operas were enchanting beyond description.\r\n\r\n\"I want to learn to play a little for myself,\" she wrote. \"And I find I\r\nhave quite a good voice. I don't want to drop behind you all, and have\r\nyou ashamed of me when I come back, for I couldn't spend a whole\r\nlifetime here, unless I had you, Hanny, and dear Doctor Joe. Tell me\r\neverything about everybody.\"\r\n\r\nHanny was always two or three days answering the letters. There were new\r\ngirls in school to talk about, and the many things the others were\r\ndoing. Charles and Jim were at the Deans so much; Mr. Dean was so\r\ninterested in them, and Mrs. Dean made it so pleasant! Mrs. Reed was\r\ninduced to come over now and then. She had softened considerably; but\r\nshe had never regained her strength, and sometimes she felt quite\r\nuseless, she declared to Mr. Reed. But he thought they had never been so\r\nhappy or comfortable.\r\n\r\nThat left Hanny quite alone. Josie seemed such a very large girl, and\r\nshe classed Hanny and Tudie as \"the children.\" Tudie was a good deal\r\nengrossed with her first large piece of worsted work. Not that Hanny was\r\nlonely! She read to her father when lessons were done, or he came\r\nupstairs to hear her play. She was learning some of the old-fashioned\r\nsongs that he had loved in his youth, though I think sometimes he leaned\r\nhis head against the high back of his chair and went sound asleep.\r\n\r\nEverybody was always wanting her; and her mother said she was a sad\r\nlittle gad-about. Even John's wife insisted upon a share of her.\r\nCleanthe wasn't bright and full of fun like Dolly, but she was very fond\r\nof the little girl, and both she and John considered it a great treat to\r\nhave her come in to tea.\r\n\r\nThere was a grand time when Zachary Taylor was inaugurated. Stephen and\r\nDolly and the Doctor and Margaret went on to Washington with many\r\nothers. They were fain to take Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"Such a crowd is no place for children,\" said Mrs. Underhill. \"There'll\r\nbe presidents likely, if the world should stand, and she'll have chances\r\nto go when the journey will do her more good.\"\r\n\r\nBen went with Mr. Whitney. And at the eleventh hour, Theodore gave in\r\nand said Delia might go, and she needn't rob her bank either.\r\n\r\nOh, what a splendid time they had! Washington has changed wonderfully\r\nsince then; but the White House and some of the government buildings are\r\njust the same. Ben was a little startled at the splendour. Mr. Theodore\r\nwas much engrossed with some friends, so Ben and Delia rambled about,\r\nlost themselves, and came to light in out-of-the-way places, hunted up\r\nfamous spots, and rehearsed old-time stories of brave men and notable\r\nwomen. The sail down the Potomac was delightful. There was Alexandria\r\nand Mount Vernon and Richmond, all of which were to become a hundred\r\ntimes more famous in the course of a few years. Ben went over this\r\nyouthful trip, so full of delight, many a time when, as a soldier, he\r\nslept under the stars, not knowing what the morrow would bring.\r\n\r\nThey were just a big boy and girl, in search of fun and knowledge, and\r\nthey found plenty of both. Ben made up his mind that, when he did go\r\nabroad, Delia certainly should be his companion.\r\n\r\nMargaret and her husband went to Baltimore at once, as they were not\r\npartial to crowds; and Dolly felt that she must get back to the\r\nchildren. But Mr. Theodore had some business on hand, so the young\r\npeople had their holiday lengthened.\r\n\r\nStill the season in New York had been a rather brilliant one, with\r\nvarious noted singers. An opera troupe from Havana had been giving some\r\nfamous operas; and Hanny was delighted to hear \"La Somnambula,\" because\r\nnow she could compare notes with Daisy Jasper.\r\n\r\nAnd in May, the famous rivalry between two leading theatres, that\r\nculminated in a great riot, occurred. Edwin Forrest, the great tragedian\r\nof that day, and many a year later, and Macready, a celebrated English\r\nactor, seemed almost pitted against each other in the same play, Hamlet.\r\nA certain party coming into existence had taken for its watchword\r\nAmericanism of a rather narrow sort, and was protesting against all\r\nforeign influence. Macready had played, and then gone to fulfil another\r\nengagement, but was to return and play again. Some of the hot heads\r\ndecided he should not; and though all precautions were taken, the\r\nfeeling was that the better sense of the community would prevent any\r\nabsolute disturbance. But the mob had grown larger and stronger in their\r\nnarrow prejudice, and, before the play was half through, an onslaught\r\nwas made on the opera-house. The rioters were in such force that the\r\nfamous Seventh Regiment had to be called out. It was a night of terror\r\nand tragedy, and the whole city was wild with alarm. So serious did it\r\nbecome, that it was not quelled without bloodshed; and for days the\r\nwhole city seemed amazed that such a thing could have happened.\r\n\r\nBut before the surprise and regret had died away, a sudden sound of\r\nalarm ran through the city, in curiously muffled tones that blanched the\r\nbravest faces,--a visitant, then feared beyond measure, that science had\r\nnot been able to cope with. People spoke of it with bated breath. It was\r\nnot simply among the poor and destitute, or those indifferent to\r\ncleanliness and order, but it spread everywhere,--the dreaded,\r\nmysterious cholera.\r\n\r\nThe older people remembered the scourge of almost twenty years before,\r\nand many of them prepared to fly to places of safety. The plague spot of\r\nthe city was then the old Five Points, where the lowest and poorest,\r\nbeggars and thieves, and sometimes murderers, had crowded in until it\r\nwas a nest to be shunned and feared. Through this tract the plague swept\r\nlike wildfire.\r\n\r\nMargaret had accepted the urgent invitation of the cousins at Tarrytown,\r\nand gone thither with her baby, insisting also upon taking her little\r\nsister. Father Underhill was glad to have her out of danger, and was\r\nfain to persuade his wife to follow.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said stoutly; \"Joe must remain; and you and Stephen cannot run\r\naway from business. With Margaret and Hanny safe, I shall stay to keep\r\nwatch over the rest of you. I may be needed.\"\r\n\r\nDolly had taken her two children up to her sisters', who lived on the\r\nHudson near Fort Washington. Stephen could drive up every day or two\r\nwith news of everybody.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem at all alarming up at the Morgan's rural home. True,\r\nCousin Famie was aging fast, and had grown more feeble than her years\r\nreally warranted. Mrs. Eustis was quite the head of the house, and very\r\nbright and chatty, with a rather romantic turn of mind, just as fond of\r\nreading as some of the younger folks.\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to them as if the world was quite full of famous people\r\nthen. For beside Cooper and Irving, there were Prescott's splendid\r\nhistories, that were full of romance. And for story-writers, Miss\r\nLeslie, who was entertaining magazine-readers, and Miss Sedgwick and\r\nLydia Maria Child. Then there was Hanny's favourite Mrs. Osgood, Alice\r\nCarey, and Mrs. Welby coming into notice, and Longfellow, Hawthorne and\r\nEmerson. The Doctor brought them up the new magazines, and said\r\neverybody kept well. Ben came up and stayed a week, and added to their\r\nstock of books.\r\n\r\nThey went down to Sleepy Hollow, though it had not become so famous for\r\npilgrimages. Mr. Irving had come home from Madrid, and friends dropped\r\nin upon him. He always had a delightful welcome for them. They used to\r\nsit out on the old porch and talk; or, when there were no guests, his\r\ntwo nieces and some of his brothers' kept him company.\r\n\r\nBen summoned up courage and went down to see the charming man, beloved\r\nof so many friends, taking his little sister with him. What a\r\ndelightful hour it was! Hanny was too shy to talk much, although she had\r\nbeen so brave on the poet's old stoop at Fordham. Perhaps, really, there\r\nwas no opportunity, Ben kept the floor so entirely. They went in and\r\nlooked at the drawings from Rip Van Winkle and Ichabod Crane and\r\nKatrina. But she still loved the old history that had charmed her so at\r\nfirst, and she would have given him her child's adoration freely, if he\r\nhad written nothing else.\r\n\r\nBen had already seen a number of notable people. They often came in at\r\nthe Harpers'. He used to talk them over with Delia; and he thought now\r\nwhat a fascinating story he should have to tell her.\r\n\r\nThe next day they went over to see grandmother and Uncle David. Jim was\r\nup making a visit. His mother preferred to have him out of danger. He\r\nand Ben were to go down to Yonkers; and though they were loth to spare\r\nthe little girl, she went back to Tarrytown.\r\n\r\nIt was October before the Doctor would let Margaret return to the city.\r\nDaisy had grown so much, and was talking in a cunning, broken fashion.\r\nMrs. Underhill had made two brief visits; and though she seemed rather\r\nnervous for her, she declared, \"She had been very well all summer, and\r\nthat they had a great deal to be thankful for. She couldn't have left\r\nfather and the boys.\"\r\n\r\nShe had never been so demonstrative to Hanny, much as she had loved her.\r\nShe kept one arm around her, and could hardly bear her out of her\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\"Had she been content, and not made any trouble, and waited upon Cousin\r\nFamie, and helped all she could? She was such a large girl now, and\r\nought to be useful.\"\r\n\r\nHanny smiled, and kissed her mother, and said: \"She had tried to do her\r\nbest. And she had been very, very happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Margaret, I do wonder if you appreciate that child,\" said\r\nRoseann, when Hanny had gone out on the porch to have a romp with little\r\nDaisy. \"She's such a smart little thing, and not a bit set up about it.\r\nI've been clear beat to see how she understands books, and people, too.\r\nAnd she's so industrious and pleasant-tempered. She makes me think of\r\nGrandmother Underhill and Aunt Eunice. I do hope you'll be able to keep\r\nher. It's a providential mercy she hasn't been in the city all summer.\r\nThe cholera has been just awful! I don't see how you had the courage to\r\nstay.\"\r\n\r\n\"My sons were there.\" The tears came to Mrs. Underhill's eyes. \"And\r\nthough they were spared, they often needed me. No one really can know\r\nwhat it was, unless they have been through it. Joe came home one night\r\nso worn out that he stayed in bed all the next day. I just prayed every\r\nmoment; I felt as if I'd never prayed before. And there was all of\r\nJohn's trouble. Yes; many a one has been called upon to part with their\r\nnearest and dearest.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Underhill's wife had lost both father and mother, within\r\ntwenty-four hours of each other. Then Cleanthe's little baby had been\r\nborn dead; and they had to move her to Mother Underhill's, more dead\r\nthan alive; but good care had at last restored her. The old Archer\r\ncousins in Henry Street had gone; and many another among friends and\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nThey did not tell Hanny until she came home who had gone out of the\r\nneighbourhood. Mrs. Reed had been among the first. She was getting ready\r\nto go away with Charles, when the summons came. But the greatest sorrow\r\nof all to her was the loss of Tudie Dean. She had been rather drooping\r\nfor several days; and one night Doctor Joe had been summoned, but in\r\nvain. Two of the prettiest of the little Jewish children who had come to\r\nthe Whitney house were buried on the same day.\r\n\r\nCleanthe was still at home, as she called her mother-in-law's house. She\r\nwas very pale and wan, and just hugged Hanny to her heart, and cried\r\nover her.\r\n\r\nCharlie Reed sorrowed deeply for his mother.\r\n\r\n\"I don't just know how it came about,\" he said tremulously; \"but we were\r\ngetting to be such friends; she took such a real interest in my studies;\r\nand she seemed to want father to be happy in the things he liked. He's\r\nmost broken-hearted over it; and the house seems dreadful! Cousin Jane\r\nadvises father to break up and board; I think she's kind of nervous, and\r\nwants a change. Oh, what a terrible time it has been; I am glad you\r\nwere away. And poor little Tudie Dean!\"\r\n\r\nThey both cried over her. And when she went in to see Josie, she was\r\nalmost heart-broken; for Josie looked so strange and grown-up, and was\r\nso grave.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dean pressed her to her heart.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God, my little dear,\" she exclaimed, \"that your mother hasn't to\r\nsorrow over any loss. Your brother has been heroic; and there was one\r\ntime when we were all afraid. He was so dead-tired that I know he\r\ncouldn't have lived if it had been cholera. The doctors were all heroes;\r\nand many of them have given their lives.\"\r\n\r\nYet the world went on, over the thousands who had dropped out of it.\r\nBusiness resumed its sway; even amusements started up. But there were\r\nmany sad households.\r\n\r\nAnd though the Underhills had not taken Cleanthe to their hearts with\r\nquite the fervor Dolly had awakened, they loved her very tenderly now;\r\nand she seemed to slip in among them with a new and closer bond.\r\n\r\nThere would be a good deal of business to settle. John thought it better\r\nto look about for a new partner. Mr. Bradley had left quite a fortune\r\nfor the times. He had been investing in up-town property, and John\r\nthought it would be wise to build, and sell or rent as his wife desired.\r\nThe old home was dismantled, the best of the furniture stored for\r\nfurther use.\r\n\r\nHe tried to persuade his father to go farther up-town. Joe was also a\r\nfactor in this matter.\r\n\r\nFor though the cholera had spared Dr. Fitch, the infirmities of age and\r\nhard work had overtaken him. A nephew who had recently graduated, and\r\nhad the prestige of the same name, was anxious to take the practice. Joe\r\nfelt as if circumstances were shaping a change for him; and he was ready\r\nnow to take up a life of his own.\r\n\r\nThen the Deans sold, and were to go up a little farther. Sometime, and\r\nbefore many years, there would be street-cars, instead of the slow,\r\nawkward stages, and people could get to and fro more rapidly. The trend\r\nwas unmistakably up-town.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed hired out his house furnished, and went over to the Deans to\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Hanny that no one was quite the same. Nora Whitney was\r\nalmost a head taller than Hanny, and was getting to be a very stylish\r\ngirl. Her voice was considered promising, and was being cultivated. But\r\npoor old Pussy Gray had rounded out his life, and slept under a great\r\nwhite rosebush at the end of the yard. Mrs. Whitney's hair was nearly\r\nall white, and she was a very pretty woman. Mr. Theodore was showing\r\nsilver in both hair and beard; but Delia changed very little. Aunt Clem\r\nwent on living in her serene and cheerful fashion.\r\n\r\nAnd then the bells rang out for the mid-century, 1850! How wonderful it\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if any one of us will live to nineteen hundred,\" questioned\r\nHanny, with a strange thrill of awe in her voice.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose I will,\" replied her father; \"but some of you may.\r\nWhy, even Stephen wouldn't be much above eighty; and you'll be a little\r\npast sixty!\" He laughed with a mellow, amused sound. \"And all you young\r\npeople of to-day will be telling your grandchildren how New York looked\r\nat the half-century mark. Well, it has made rapid strides since eighteen\r\nhundred. I sometimes wonder what there is to happen next. We have steam\r\non land and water. We have discovered Eldorado, and invented the\r\ntelegraph; and there are people figuring on laying one across the ocean.\r\nThat may come in your day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a sewing-machine,\" added the little girl, smilingly.\r\n\r\nThe sewing-machine was attracting a good deal of attention now, and\r\nmaking itself a useful factor.\r\n\r\nBut to live to see nineteen hundred! That would be like discovering the\r\nfountain of perpetual youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nUP-TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere had been so many delightful things in First Street, the little\r\ngirl thought at first it would almost break her heart to go away. Her\r\nfather, with the inertia of coming years, hated to be disturbed.\r\n\r\n\"I hoped, when we did make any change, we would build on the old place,\"\r\nhe said. \"I'd like country life again. But I am getting too old to farm;\r\nand none of the boys care about it. If George had stayed at home,\" and\r\nFather Underhill sighed.\r\n\r\nGeorge had not yet found his bonanza. There was gold in plenty in that\r\nwonderful country. There were hardships, too. He kept those to tell of\r\nin after years. It was a wild, rough, marvellous life; and every man of\r\nthem was waiting for a run of luck, that he might go East with his pile.\r\nMeanwhile cities were begun.\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill sighed a little also, in an undecided fashion. All the\r\nchildren were here, and surely they could not go away and leave them\r\nbehind. The attractive, rural aspect of Yonkers had changed, or was it\r\nthat she had changed? Some of her old friends had gone to new homes\r\nsome had died. Then she had grown so accustomed to the stirring life of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\"No, we should not want to go alone,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Steve's a bright business-man. John's long-headed, if he isn't quite so\r\nbrilliant. Ben will be all for books and travel. And Jim--well, it's\r\nodd, but there won't be a farmer among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" returned their mother, not knowing whether to be glad or sorry.\r\n\r\n\"Then farming is changing. And the near-by places are turning into\r\ntowns. What the next half of the century will bring--\"\r\n\r\nSince there was no prospect of the homestead, they allowed themselves to\r\nbe persuaded to join the migration. Foreigners were crowding them a\r\nlittle. There was a finer, freer air up-town.\r\n\r\nThe Deans suited themselves, and Mr. Reed and Charles went with them.\r\nCharles was now a tall, fair young fellow, rather grave from the shock\r\nof the loss of his mother, intensified perhaps by his sympathy with Mrs.\r\nDean and Josie. It was a great comfort to keep together.\r\n\r\nJohn looked up a new home; but Cleanthe, with her arms around Mrs.\r\nUnderhill's neck, said, in a broken sort of tone:--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must be somewhere near us! I don't feel as if I could live, if\r\nI did not see you every day. I have no mother but you.\"\r\n\r\nTwentieth Street seemed a long way up, to be sure. But there was an odd,\r\nrather oldish house, with a two-story ell that seemed to have been added\r\nas an after-thought. There was a stable and quite a garden. It had been\r\nconsidered rather a country house in its inception.\r\n\r\nJoe insisted that it was just the thing. He could have an office and a\r\nlibrary, and a sleeping-room overhead, without disturbing the family.\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill declared there was twice too much room; and if any of the\r\nother boys should marry and go away--\r\n\r\n\"There's only Ben. I am a fixture; and it will be years before Jim\r\nreaches that tempting period. Oh, I think you need not worry!\" comforted\r\nthe Doctor.\r\n\r\nHanny was glad to go with everybody else. They had one sad sweet time at\r\nthe Deans, talking over old days and the tea in the back-yard, when\r\nthere had been Nora and the pussy, and the one who was not. It was\r\nrather sad to outgrow childhood. Ah, how merry they had been! What a\r\nsimple idyllic memory this was to be for all her later years! Mrs. Reed\r\nalways lived in First Street to her; and Tudie Dean used to go up and\r\ndown the street, a blessed, beautiful ghost. The little girl was quite\r\nsure she would not be afraid to clasp her white hand, if she should meet\r\nher wandering about those sacred precincts. She could not have put her\r\nidea into Longfellow's beautiful lines; but it haunted her in the same\r\nshape of remembrance.\r\n\r\n    \"All houses wherein men have lived and died\r\n        Are haunted houses.\"\r\n\r\nThey went down to the Jasper house also. There had been a family of\r\nchildren to tramp over the flower-beds and leave debris about. There\r\nwas no pretty striped awning, no wheeling-chair, no slim, picturesque\r\nnegro lad, and no ladies in light lawns sitting about. It looked\r\ncommon-place.\r\n\r\n\"We can write Ichabod on it,\" said Charles, half regretfully.\r\n\r\nHanny asked Joe why they should; and he showed her the verse, \"Thy glory\r\nhas departed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The glory has departed from the whole street,\" she said, glancing\r\naround. The new-comers were of a different class. No one swept the\r\ndebris up to the crown of the street any more; and the city\r\nstreet-sweepers were infrequent visitors.\r\n\r\n\"It will be beginning all over again,\" Dr. Hoffman said to his\r\nbrother-in-law. \"It seems a pity to waste so much endeavour. Yet if you\r\n_can_ wait, the practice will be better worth while.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be the fair thing to crowd in on young Dr. Fitch. He did\r\nsuggest a partnership, but I thought I would rather strike out for\r\nmyself. And I prefer having all my interests at home. Mother begins to\r\nmiss the children that have gone out; and there were so many of us.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Underhill looked back, she always thought those early years in\r\nFirst Street were among the happiest of her life. They were broader and\r\nricher than the first wedded years. They could not keep together always.\r\nShe wanted her children to know the sweetness of life and love. Steve\r\nand Margaret were very happy. John and his wife had supped of sorrow;\r\nbut they were young and had each other; and children would come to\r\nrestore beauty for ashes, and the oil of joy for mourning.\r\n\r\nShe was delighted with Joe's decision. That night, when Joe had come\r\nhome a very ghost of himself, and dropped down on Hanny's bed, because\r\nhe hadn't strength to go up another pair of stairs, and she had clasped\r\nher arms about him and cried, in her terror: \"Oh, Joe, my dear son, is\r\nit cholera?\" had been an awful moment for her.\r\n\r\n\"No, mother dear; but if I can't have a few hours' rest, I shall die of\r\nfatigue. Just let me sleep, but watch me well.\"\r\n\r\nShe had sat beside him the rest of the night, from midnight to morning,\r\ncounting his pulse now and then, which showed no indication of collapse.\r\nOther mothers had their sons snatched from them,--mothers who were\r\ntender and worthy, and who loved as fervently as she did.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke at the next noon, she felt as if he had been given back to\r\nher out of a great danger. And she was glad now to have him plan for the\r\nhome-interest, glad there would be several years before she was called\r\nupon to share him with any other woman.\r\n\r\nSo they said good-bye to the old house again, and placed their household\r\ngods in a new home. They had gone farther than any of the others, though\r\nthey were nearer Margaret and Dolly. The Deans were lower down and on\r\nSecond Avenue. Up above them were great open spaces. They had two lots,\r\nwhich gave them a grassy space beside the drive. The lot being deeper\r\nthan usual, they could have a little garden where the fruit-trees did\r\nnot shade. There was a tall, gnarled old pear-tree, and they found it\r\nbore excellent fruit. Right by the porch, in a lovely southern exposure,\r\nwas a delicious nectarine.\r\n\r\nThe little girl was deeply interested in Joe's house, as she began to\r\ncall it. A door opened from the main hall, and one quite outside from\r\nthe flagged path. That would be the patients' entrance, when they began\r\nto come. Joe went up to Yonkers and exhumed some old furniture. There\r\nwas a queer, brass-studded, leather-covered sofa, with high roll arms,\r\nand a roll at the back that suggested a pillow. There were two small\r\nspindle-legged tables; some high-backed, oaken chairs, rudely carved,\r\nand almost black with age; and a curious old _escritoire_ that was said\r\nto have come from France with the French grandmother who had landed with\r\nthe emigrants at New Rochelle.\r\n\r\nHis office was plainly appointed, with an oil-cloth on the floor, a row\r\nof shelves for jars of medicines; for even then many doctors compounded\r\ntheir own prescriptions. There was a plain business-desk, a table, and\r\nsome chairs, and a small book-case. All the odd old things were to go in\r\nhis sitting-room.\r\n\r\nAcross one end, he had it filled in with book-shelves. One corner was\r\nfor the little girl. And there was to be a special chair for her, so she\r\ncould come in and study her lessons, or read or talk to her dear Doctor\r\nJoe.\r\n\r\nMrs. French made a splendid addition to the room in a large Oriental rug\r\nthat Doctor Joe valued more highly as the years went on. For then we\r\nwere getting bright-hued carpets from French and English looms, and\r\nthese dull old things were not in any great favour. Only it was so thick\r\nand soft, the little girl said it was good enough for a bed.\r\n\r\nJoe laughed. \"I daresay I shall take many a nap on it. You must make me\r\na nice pillow-cushion, out of some of your bits of silk.\"\r\n\r\nPeople made real sensible patchwork then, or worked a cover in worsted,\r\nwith perhaps a pretty bunch of flowers.\r\n\r\nThe house had a basement-kitchen at the back, and a dumb-waiter like\r\nMargaret's. Mrs. Underhill thought at first she shouldn't like it. There\r\nwas a spacious area, which made Hanny think of Mrs. Dean's in First\r\nStreet, where they used to play tea.\r\n\r\nIt took a long while to get settled, somehow. Ben thought it a great way\r\nup-town; and he often went to the Whitneys to tea, when he wanted his\r\nevening. Jim grumbled a little, too; there were no nice fellows around.\r\nJoe insisted that he had better not hunt up any, but pay strict\r\nattention to his studies, for he was falling dreadfully behind. But when\r\nJim had to work or study, he went at it with all his might and main, and\r\ngenerally managed to catch up.\r\n\r\nThe little girl and her father were perhaps the best pleased. He liked\r\nthe little garden spot. He was not confining himself very closely to\r\nbusiness now. There were so many pretty walks around, for it was still\r\nquite rural, and you could find a few wild flowers. There was another\r\nvery amusing feature farther up-town, and that was the \"squatters,\" with\r\ntheir pigs and goats and geese, and their rich, wonderful brogue, their\r\nodd attire, which was in the same style as when they landed. Connemara\r\ncloaks had not then attracted the fashionable eye; but the women seemed\r\nto wear them to keep out both heat and cold. Red, green, and plaided\r\nseemed the favourites. The wide cap-ruffles caught the breeze, for one\r\nalways found a breeze in this vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe little girl's happiness was rendered complete by the gift of a\r\nbeautiful Maltese kitten about half-grown. It had a black nose, and\r\nblack pads to its feet, and a fashion of pricking up its small ears like\r\na dog. There was a great discussion about a name; and Joe suggested\r\n\"Major,\" as she was still fond of military heroes.\r\n\r\nOne evening Ben said: \"Jim, the Whitneys are going over into Jersey on\r\nan exploring expedition, to view some curious old places, Cockloft Hall\r\namong them. Don't you want to go?\"\r\n\r\nJim glanced up lazily. The boys were to play ball, as they often did, on\r\nSaturday afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's the place where the Salmagundi Club used to meet,\" cried\r\nHanny, with eager interest. \"It is in Newark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and there's another queer nest on the Passaic where a great\r\nsportsman lives, Henry William Herbert, the Frank Forrester of some\r\nstirring adventures. Mr. Whitney is to see him. And there are some other\r\nold haunts; Delia was looking them up,--the Kearny house, and an old\r\nplace that was once used as a sort of fort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dele Whitney goes round just like a boy!\" said Jim, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why shouldn't she go with her brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ben, can't I go with you?\" pleaded Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"Jersey's a queer sort of State,\" said Jim, teasingly. \"The Blue Laws\r\nare still in operation. You are not allowed to stay out after dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are they printed in blue? And you don't mean to stay out after dark, do\r\nyou, Ben?\"\r\n\r\nHanny's expression was so simply honest they all laughed, which rather\r\ndisconcerted her.\r\n\r\n\"It is because you feel pretty blue when you have to obey them; and\r\nJersey is out of the United States.\"\r\n\r\n\"It just isn't, Mr. Jim!\" cried Hanny, indignantly. \"It's one of the\r\nMiddle States.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite the fashion then to laugh at New Jersey, in spite of the\r\ngeography; though even at that remote date New Jersey peaches were held\r\nin high esteem.\r\n\r\n\"But if you went with Dele Whitney, we shouldn't know when to look for\r\nyou--hardly where,\" and Jim winked.\r\n\r\nThat was an allusion to an old visit at the Museum, when they stayed all\r\nthe evening, for the same admittance.\r\n\r\n\"I've half suspected you were the ringleader of that scheme, Jim,\" said\r\nhis doctor-brother. \"I have a mind to go. One good thing about the\r\nWhitneys is that you can invite yourself, and no one takes umbrage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do go!\" said Ben; and Hanny came around to give his hand a tender,\r\npersuasive squeeze. \"I haven't explored the State very much, but it has\r\nsome curious features. The magnolia and many Southern flowers grow\r\nthere. I believe almost every kind of mineral, even to gold, is found in\r\nthe State. And it is rich in historic lore.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was Valley Forge,\" said Hanny, softly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the Delaware River is beautiful. And the Passaic winds half around\r\nthe State. It is twenty-seven miles by water,--a delightful sail we must\r\ntake some time, Hanny.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shouldn't have time for that now. We are to start at one. Delia'll\r\nbe glad enough to have you go, Hanny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may count on us,\" returned Joe.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll take the ball game,\" said Jim.\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill had been settling on a final negative. She had a little\r\nfeeling about Delia Whitney; she could not quite approve of grown girls\r\nrunning about so much with boys. And she thought if she was going to set\r\nup for a genius, she ought to be delicate and refined. But Joe always\r\ncarried the day, and she could trust her darling with him.\r\n\r\nIt was Margaret's Saturday, so Hanny ran around in the morning to tell\r\nher of the new arrangements. They were to meet the Whitneys at\r\nCourtlandt Street, so they had an early lunch, and started in good time.\r\nHanny was so interested in everything that she was a charming companion.\r\n\r\nIt seemed queer that Mr. Whitney could remember when there was no\r\nrailroad, and you travelled mostly by stage-coaches. It had cost almost\r\na quarter then, with the ferriage and toll-gates, if you walked to\r\nNewark. And now you could go through to Washington on the train.\r\n\r\nShe thought it quite a fearful thing to go through the Harlem tunnel;\r\nbut here there was a road cut through great, high, frowning rocks that\r\nmade you feel as if you were in a dungeon. Then a long, level stretch of\r\nsalt meadows with ditches cut across them, that suggested a vague idea\r\nof Holland. We did not know the world quite so well then.\r\n\r\nNewark, in those days, was a sort of country town with country roads in\r\nall directions. At intervals, a stage went up Broad Street, which was\r\nhandsome and wide and lined with stately trees. They thought it best to\r\nwait awhile for this, lest Hanny should get too tired.\r\n\r\n\"But you can't half see,\" declared Delia.\r\n\r\n\"When we come to the curiosities, we will get out,\" said Mr. Whitney.\r\n\"We can't afford to miss them.\"\r\n\r\nThey passed a pretty park full of magnificent elms, with an old grey\r\nstone church standing in it, one of the oldest churches in the State.\r\nThere were a number of stores, interspersed with private dwellings, and\r\neverything wore a sort of leisurely aspect. A little farther up was\r\nanother park,--commons, they were called then. The modest old houses and\r\nlarge gardens and fields gave it a still more complete country aspect.\r\n\r\nThe stage stopped at a tavern where some people were waiting. The sign\r\nwas \"The Black Horse Tavern.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will get out and begin our adventures,\" said Mr. Whitney, smilingly.\r\n\"This little sort of creek was called First River. I dare say in past\r\ndays it came rushing over the hill in quite a wild way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there a Second River?\" asked Delia, mirthfully.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed there is, at Belleville. There used to be an old mill\r\nhereabouts, and this was the mill brook. Once or twice, in a freshet,\r\nthe stream has risen so that it swept the bridge away.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's meek enough now,\" said Ben. \"Black Horse Tavern! That ought to be\r\nin a book.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a small one-story building, looking very old even then. Over\r\nopposite, a pretty house stood on a slight elevation, that dated back to\r\n1820, with its sloping lawn and green fields, its churn and bright\r\nmilkpans standing out in the sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to go round, as the frogs advise,\" said Mr. Whitney,\r\nlooking about him with an air of consideration. \"We might get through\r\nsome of these driveways; but there seems to be no regular street.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if we go round?\" commented Delia, questioningly.\r\n\r\n\"We go straight up this road until we come to a winding path called the\r\nGully, then down to the river, where we shall find Herbert's, thence\r\ndown the river to Cockloft Hall. But we will return by the upper\r\nrailroad, as we shall be near that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then,\" said Dele, laughingly, when her brother had ended his\r\nexplanations, \"if you _can_ go straight on a crooked road; and if Hanny\r\ngets tired, Ben and I will make a chair and carry her.\"\r\n\r\nJoe smiled down at his little sister. He had linked his arm within hers.\r\nBen and Delia were fond of falling behind. They were so merry, that\r\nHanny was a little curious to know what they found to laugh about. It\r\ndoes not take much to amuse healthy young people before their tastes\r\nbecome complicated.\r\n\r\nThe old road wound a little, and had the curves that prove no one horse\r\nor man ever walks in a straight line. But, oh, how beautiful it was with\r\nthe fruit-trees and shrubbery in bloom, wild flowers, and stretches of\r\nmeadow, where cows were pastured, and here and there a small flock of\r\nsheep! Up above, on the brow of a hill, a wooded background gave it a\r\nstill more picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nThey passed an old stone house on the west side that was really a\r\nRevolutionary relic. The stone ran up to the eaves; but the two gables\r\nwere of timber. It was on quite a bit of hill then, and had broken stone\r\nsteps up to the first terrace, where great clumps of brownish yellow\r\nlilies were in bloom. When strolling parties of British soldiery went\r\nmarauding about, the residents of this vicinity used to flee to the old\r\nPlum house as a place of refuge. The heavy double doors and wooden\r\nshutters could not well be battered down, though bullet-marks could be\r\ntraced here and there.\r\n\r\nA Captain Alden lived in it now, who was himself quite a character. He\r\nhad been in the British navy, with Admiral Nelson's command. When his\r\ntime in the service ended, he had shipped with what he understood was a\r\nmerchant vessel, but on learning it was a slaver, bound for Africa to\r\ngather up a human cargo, he sprang overboard, when he saw a vessel\r\npassing that halted for his signal. Several shots were fired at him,\r\nwhich he escaped. Later on, he was impressed in the naval service again,\r\nbut at the first opportunity came to America. A hale, hearty old man,\r\nrather short in stature, but lithe and active, and with a merry look on\r\nhis weather-beaten face, he was still proud of his schooner that lay at\r\nStone Dock, at the launching of which, in the early part of the century,\r\nthe Jersey Blues had turned out, and Major Stevens had christened it the\r\n\"Northern Liberties.\" It had been all built of Essex County lumber, and\r\nconstructed on the Passaic. But the river had been quite a famous stream\r\nin those days. There were no factories using up its volume of water.\r\n\r\nThey sat on the stone coping and listened to the Captain's stories,\r\nindeed, could have spent all the afternoon, so entertaining did he\r\nprove. Then he took them through the old house with its ample hall and\r\nspacious rooms on one side. They concluded it must have been able to\r\nstand quite a siege, judging from its present solidity. And Mrs. Alden\r\ntreated them to a pitcher of freshly churned buttermilk, and a slice of\r\nexcellent rye bread, which they found delightful.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to come over again, and get some material for a story,\"\r\ndeclared Delia, when they were fairly started, tearing themselves away\r\nwith quite a struggle. \"That experience on the 'Slaver' was very\r\ngraphic.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you want to hear something that will make your hair stand on end,\"\r\nsaid Doctor Joe, \"come up and talk to father. When I was a little lad,\r\nwe had a farm-hand working for us who had gone through with it all, been\r\nto Africa for a cargo, and come to the States with what was left of it.\r\nHe never spoke of it when sober; and though he was in the main steady,\r\nonce in a while he drank enough to start him going, and he always\r\nrehearsed this horrible experience. I remember father used to lock him\r\nin the barn to sober up; because he did not want us children to hear the\r\nterrible story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were the slaves brought that way?\" asked Hanny, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n\"Most every civilised country condemns that part of the awful practice,\"\r\nanswered Ben. \"But it is a fact that the native tribes in Africa sell\r\nprisoners to one another, or whoever will buy them. Do you suppose\r\nAfrica will ever be explored?\" and Ben looked up at Mr. Whitney.\r\n\r\nWe did not know much about Africa even then. But Ben was afterward to\r\nsee the great explorer Stanley, whose journey across that country was a\r\nwonderful romance. And although the question of slavery was seething\r\neven then, he could not have dreamed, this lovely afternoon when all was\r\nat peace, that one day he should be in the thick of the battle himself,\r\nwith many another brave soul, when his country was nearly rent in twain.\r\n\r\nA few lanes led up to places, the outline of streets, and lost\r\nthemselves in the fields. Cottages had been built to face nearly every\r\nway. Here and there was an old colonial house of greater pretensions,\r\nsome of them at the end of a long driveway lined with stately trees.\r\nHere also were the remnants of orchards, meadows where cows were\r\npasturing, thickets of shrubbery with bread-and-butter vine running over\r\nthem, showing glossy green leaves.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitney paused at a queer, long, one-story house with a high-peaked\r\nroof in which were set three small dormer windows. There was a little\r\ndooryard in front, a Dutch hall door with an iron knocker, a well near\r\nby with the old oaken bucket General Morris had immortalised, and back\r\nof the house a picturesque ravine through which ran a clear stream of\r\nwater that presently found its way out to the Passaic. Willows bent over\r\nit, elms and maples stood, tall and handsome, like guardian sentinels.\r\n\r\nA little old woman sat sewing by the window.\r\n\r\n\"We haven't time to stop,\" said Mr. Whitney. \"Hanny, that lady is your\r\nhero's grandmother, and the mother of General Watts Kearny. He not only\r\ndistinguished himself in the Mexican War, but also in the War of 1812.\r\nThen he was Governor of Vera Cruz and the City of Mexico.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the hero of no end of stories,\" added Ben. \"Jim and I were wild\r\nover them a few years ago. Why do people keep saying we have no romance\r\nin our own country, because we have no ruined old castles? Why, Mexico\r\nitself is a land of historical romance!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely cool dell!\" exclaimed Dele. \"Just the place to take your\r\nbook on a hot summer day.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe your young hero Philip was born in New York. But this is the\r\nold home, one of the landmarks.\"\r\n\r\nOpposite was a rather pretty place,--a rambling brick house with sharp,\r\npointed roofs, and a long stretch of evergreens. It was beautiful in\r\nthis soft atmosphere. The birds made a swift dazzle now and then, and\r\nfilled the air with melody.\r\n\r\n\"Up here is a hedge of hawthorn that was brought over from England by a\r\nYorkshireman living up above. It is out of bloom now; but another year\r\nyou can come over early in May and see the 'hawthorn blossoms white'\r\nthat poets never tire of praising.\"\r\n\r\nDele broke off a sprig for herself, and one for Hanny. The spaces were\r\nlarger, the houses farther apart. On the west side was a tree-nursery\r\nand garden, and two quaint old frame-houses that hardly looked large\r\nenough for any one to live in; but there were children playing about;\r\nand on the other side a cemetery. All this tract was known as Mount\r\nPleasant.\r\n\r\nAt the north of the cemetery, they plunged down a stony way called a\r\nroad, mostly by courtesy, though it was the only way of getting up from\r\nthe river. Great trees overhung it on one side, and gave it a weird,\r\ndarkened aspect.\r\n\r\n\"It might be a ghost-walk, at night,\" exclaimed Delia. \"Edgar A. Poe\r\ncould have put a story here. I like the tragic; but I'm not so fond of\r\nthe horrible.\"\r\n\r\nAnother turn showed them the river and the opposite shore crowned with\r\ngreen glittering in the afternoon sunshine. They all paused, it was such\r\na wonderful outlook.\r\n\r\nAnd when they reached it, and glanced up and down, it was a picture\r\nindeed. The river made little bends, and wound around tiny points, edged\r\nwith the greenest of sedge grass in some places, then grey stones with\r\nmossy sea-growth, or willows dipping their branches in the lightly\r\nruffled water. Not a soul to be seen anywhere, not a sound save the\r\nvoices of birds; but while they looked, a flock of geese came floating\r\ngrandly down.\r\n\r\n    \"On thy fair bosom, silver lake,\r\n    The white swan spreads her snowy sail,\"\r\n\r\nquoted Delia.\r\n\r\n\"It is not the first time swans have proved geese,\" said Mr. Theodore,\r\nwith a smile. \"But for the sake of the picturesque we will let it pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if the Wye or the Severn would be so enchanting to us if poets\r\nhad not lived there and immortalised them?\"\r\n\r\n\"When we are an old country, we will, no doubt, sigh for relics. In\r\n1666, this was called 'Neworke or Pesayak towne;' and a little more than\r\na hundred years ago this Gully was made the dividing line between the\r\ntowns. There are many historic spots in Belleville, and an old copper\r\nmine that once made a great addition to her prosperity. But my quest\r\nends here. I don't know as I have a hero exactly, Miss Hanny, yet my\r\nfriend, Frank Forrester, has had a varied and eventful life. This way.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitney led them up a path mostly over-grown with pale, spindling\r\ngrass that had no chance for sunshine, so close and tall were the trees.\r\nIt was undeniably gloomy, hidden away here. A little old brown,\r\nweather-beaten house hung with vines, that even stretched up into the\r\ntrees; small, narrow windows, with diamond-shaped panes that could not\r\nlet in much light, it would seem.\r\n\r\n\"It's a horrid place,\" cried Dele. \"Hanny, we shall surely see a ghost.\r\nThe idea of living at the very foot of a burying-ground!\"\r\n\r\nHanny held tight to Joe's hand. She was beginning to have what Miss\r\nCynthia called the \"creeps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nOUT-OF-THE-WAY CORNERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the outside was gloomy, it had a queer, disorderly, and rather\r\ncheerful aspect within, for the sun was pouring a flood of gold in one\r\nwindow where it happened to strike a spot between two trees. And Frank\r\nForrester was by no means melancholy to-day. He shook hands cordially\r\nwith Mr. Whitney, and welcomed the rest of the party with the utmost\r\naffability,--a fine-looking Englishman with a picturesque air, due\r\nlargely to his rather long hair, which fell about his forehead and neck\r\nin a tumbled manner, suggesting a tendency to curls.\r\n\r\n\"These young people may like to look over my curiosities, while we have\r\nour talk,\" he said. \"Take a cigar, and I'll bring a bottle of wine.\r\nWon't you join us, Doctor? Here, young folks, are curiosities from\r\neverywhere.\"\r\n\r\nHe ushered them into a small room that was library and everything by\r\nturns. There were trophies of hunting expeditions, some rare birds\r\nstuffed and mounted, looking so alive Hanny would not have been\r\nsurprised if they had suddenly begun to warble; books in every stage of\r\ndilapidation, some of them quite rare copies, Ben found; portfolios of\r\nold engravings; curious weapons; foreign wraps; Grecian and Turkish bits\r\nof pottery; and the odd things we call bric-à-brac nowadays.\r\n\r\nDelia began to make some notes. Ben laughed a little. Interviewing was\r\nnot such a fine art then; and people were considered greater subjects of\r\ninterest than their belongings. But Delia was saving up things for\r\nstories which she meant to write as she found time.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe had come in here with the young people, leaving the two\r\nfriends to discuss their business. He, too, found much to interest him;\r\nand he was amused at Delia's running comments, some of them very bright\r\nindeed. She was quite a spur to Ben, he found; and he was surprised at\r\nthe varied stock of knowledge Ben had accumulated.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem as if they had explored half, when Mr. Whitney opened\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"Young folks, we must be going, if we expect to reach home that very\r\nsame night, like the old woman with her pig,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Are you talked out?\" asked Delia, archly; \"for we haven't half looked\r\nthrough things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want your brother to stay and have some supper with me. I'm my own\r\nhousekeeper now; but I think we could manage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fun it would be,\" said Delia. \"As there are no stores, we should\r\nhave to start at the foundation of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a loaf of bread, and some cold mutton, and eggs, I think, and\r\ntea and coffee. Come, you had better accept my hospitality.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be home in the early evening,\" remarked Doctor Joe.\r\n\r\n\"And Hanny's not to stay out after dark,\" appended Ben.\r\n\r\n\"We are going down to Cockloft Hall,\" explained Mr. Whitney. \"I am sorry\r\nwe cannot accept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must bring your happy family again. If they are fond of\r\ncuriosities, the old house could entertain them all day long.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if they are fond of adventures, which they are, they might put you\r\nto the test,\" said Delia, daringly.\r\n\r\nHerbert laughed at the vivacious tone.\r\n\r\n\"Then you'd have to find me in the mood. In that respect, I am\r\nvariable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you have a mood for each day? Then your friends could be sure--\"\r\n\r\n\"A good idea, like the ladies' reception-days. Must I put on the card,\r\nSerious, Jolly, Adventurous, etc.?\"\r\n\r\n\"And supernatural. I should come on the ghost days. For if ever a ghost\r\nwalked out of its earthy habitation, I should think it would be here.\r\nDid you ever see a ghost, Mr. Herbert?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen some queer things. But these up here,\" nodding his head,\r\n\"seem a very well behaved community. I can't say that they have troubled\r\nme; and I've come down the road at twelve or so at night. Perhaps my\r\nimagination is not vivid enough in that line. Have you ever seen a\r\nghost, Miss Whitney?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I have not, except the ghosts of my imagination. I can shut my eyes\r\nnow, and see them come trooping down that lonely road by twos and\r\nthrees.\"\r\n\r\nHerbert laughed again. \"A vivid imagination is worth a good deal at\r\ntimes,\" he said. \"There ought to be a ghost-walk about here; and next\r\ntime you come over, we'll arrange one so perfectly that he shall defy\r\ndetection. I'll walk a bit with you, if I am not a ghost.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he put on his wide-brimmed, rather high-crowned hat, he looked more\r\nSpanish than English. They went through another room that opened on a\r\nporch, and, from thence, through the garden, or an attempt at one that\r\ndid not betoken signal success.\r\n\r\nThe cemetery sloped down from a high hill that was such a thicket of\r\nwoods it hid all indications of the City of the Dead. The placid river,\r\nin which there was only a gentle tide up here, lapped the shores with a\r\nlittle murmur as it came up from the bay. The green, irregular shore\r\nopposite showed here and there a house. The wood-robins were beginning\r\ntheir vespers already. Hanny thought them the sweetest singers she had\r\never heard.\r\n\r\nJust here there was a terraced garden-spot and an old house adorned with\r\nall kinds of blossoming shrubbery.\r\n\r\n\"You see we two are guardians of the place, at either end. Miss\r\nWhitney, this house could tell some interesting tales of the bygone\r\ntime; but the glory is departing. In a few years the city will stretch\r\nout and invade our solitude.\"\r\n\r\nA wild spot of ground it was below, hilly, gravelly, sloping sharply\r\ndown to the river. But people were beginning to take advantage of the\r\nshore-edge for business. There were shops, and a foundry stretching out\r\nsmoky, dingy arms in various directions.\r\n\r\nThey said their good-byes here, as they were in sight of the old\r\nGouverneur mansion. And no one guessed then that a tragedy of love and\r\ndesperation to madness was soon to follow, and that in the dreary old\r\nhouse \"Frank Forrester\" was to lie, slain by his own hand, that he waved\r\nso jauntily to them as he bade them \"Come again.\"\r\n\r\nThey scrambled up the small ascent, and sprang over the wall. Here was\r\nwhere the Nine Worthies used to come for their merry-making in their\r\nexuberant youth, and, as one of their number said afterward, \"enlivened\r\nthe solitude by their mad-cap pranks and juvenile orgies.\" The house had\r\nnot been much modernised up to that period. Its young owner, Mr. Kemble,\r\nwho was the Patroon of the merry company, still held it. They found the\r\nold honeydew cherry-tree standing; but some of its long-armed branches\r\nwere going to decay. The odd, octagonal summer-house had not then fallen\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nThey went up to the old room in the south-western angle, the green\r\nmoreen chamber, as it had been called, where the Nine Worthies used to\r\ncongregate, and where Irving concocted some choice bits of fun for the\r\nSalamagundi Club. And here was the great drawing-room where they\r\ndisposed themselves to sociable naps on Sunday afternoons, the\r\nvine-covered porch on which they sat and smoked starlit evenings, and\r\nthe grassy lawn over which they rambled. And now Mr. Washington Irving\r\nhad been minister to Spain, and the guest of noted people in England and\r\non the continent. He had won fame in more than one line, and hosts of\r\nappreciative readers.\r\n\r\nHanny could hardly realise it all, as she thought of the still handsome\r\nthough rather delicate man, past middle life, gracious and dignified and\r\nkindly, sitting on his own porch at Sunnyside. She couldn't help going\r\nback to her first love, the old \"Knickerbocker History\" that seemed so\r\nreal to her, even now.\r\n\r\nThe hand of improvement touched Cockloft Hall shortly after. The old\r\nsummer-house was taken down; the famous cherry-tree, where the robins\r\nsang and reared their young for so many generations, succumbed to old\r\nage and wintry blasts; but she was glad she had seen it in its romantic\r\nhalo.\r\n\r\nThey were not far from the upper railroad station then,--the old Morris\r\nand Essex that had stirred up the country people mightily when it first\r\nwent thundering through quiet vales, and screaming out at little\r\nway-stations. They were just in time for a train. The sun had dropped\r\ndown behind the Orange Mountain, though the whole west was alive with\r\nchangeful gold and scarlet, melting to fainter tints, changing to\r\nindescribable hues and visionary islands floating in seas of amber and\r\nchrysoprase.\r\n\r\nHanny was quite tired, and leaned her head on Joe's shoulder. Ben and\r\nDelia were in front, and Mr. Whitney in the seat behind. They kept up an\r\nanimated conversation, and thought it had been a delightful afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"And I feel like quoting a bit out of a letter of the Poet Gray,\" said\r\nBen. \"'Do you not think a man may be the wiser, I had almost said\r\nbetter, for going a hundred or two miles?' We have gone a tenth or so of\r\nthat, and I feel ever so much richer as well as wiser. How is it with\r\nyou, little Hanny?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been to the land of heroes,\" she replied, with a soft smile. \"I\r\nshall insist that Jim must honour New Jersey in the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo!\" said Mr. Whitney. \"And there are many more heroes in it, and I\r\nthink some heroines, that we must hunt up at a leisure day. There was\r\nAnn Halsted of Elizabethtown, who saw the British foraging expedition\r\ncoming over from Staten Island, where the ship lay at anchor; and,\r\ndonning a suit of her father's clothes, and taking an old musket, she\r\nwent down to the only road they could come up, and blazed away at them\r\nwith such intrepidity that the red-coats were alarmed lest a whole squad\r\nmight be quartered there, and retreated in haste. It was said when\r\nWashington heard of it, he toasted the young lady. And there were the\r\nbrave women of Valley Forge.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Moll Pitcher, don't forget her,\" put in Ben. \"We in New York don't\r\nown quite everything.\"\r\n\r\nThey went rumbling into the tunnel, and Hanny started. She was used to\r\nthe Harlem tunnel; but this came upon her unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"And there are three considerable tunnels,\" laughed Delia. \"Yet there\r\nare people who believe the State is one vast sandy plain, and that the\r\nagricultural products are solely watermelons and peaches. Some one\r\nalways stands ready to believe ridiculous things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hereafter, we will take up the cudgels for New Jersey,\" declared Ben.\r\n\"I am hungry as a bear! That rye bread was splendid, wasn't it! We must\r\nask mother to make some, Joe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whitney begged them to stop to tea; but Doctor Joe thought they had\r\nbetter get home. They were late, of course; but Mrs. Underhill had a\r\nnice supper for them.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim heard about Captain Alden, he half wished he had gone.\r\n\r\n\"But I had to come in and save the day, or we should have been beaten\r\nout of sight, so I was of some use,\" he announced.\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill was put on her mettle by hearing about Mrs. Alden's rye\r\nbread; and the very next week she made some quite as splendid.\r\n\r\nHanny displayed her sprig of hawthorn,--real hawthorn.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it isn't artificial?\" asked Jim, teasingly.\r\n\r\n\"An artificial branch can't grow,\" she said indignantly.\r\n\r\nThe next week at school, the girls' compositions had to be read aloud;\r\nand Hanny wrote about her tour, which received the highest commendation.\r\n\r\nDelia came up to get the story of the man who had been on board the\r\nslave ship. She had a sketch of her own under way, and she wanted to\r\nmake it very thrilling.\r\n\r\n\"And I shall have to give you half the money for it,\" she said\r\nlaughingly.\r\n\r\nIt had a rather amusing hitch about its acceptance. The editor of the\r\npaper to which it was offered liked it extremely for its vigourous\r\ntreatment, but begged her to use a masculine name, or simply initials,\r\nbecause it didn't sound like a young girl's story.\r\n\r\nShe told this over with great gusto, and showed her check for twenty\r\ndollars. But Mr. Underhill magnanimously refused to accept the half of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I don't approve of so much mannishness in a girl,\" Mrs. Underhill said\r\ndecisively. In her heart she wished Ben did not like her so well. But\r\nthey really were more like two boys than lovers.\r\n\r\nShe took every occasion to make sharp little comments. Delia was rather\r\ncareless in her attire; and while she dressed her heroines in the styles\r\nof their period, or in good taste, if they were modern, she had a rather\r\nmismatched look herself, except when she wore white, which she nearly\r\nalways did evenings at home.\r\n\r\nAnd she made home a really delightful place. She was quite ambitious for\r\nreception evenings. Mrs. Osgood was holding them for a literary circle.\r\nOf course she could not aim at anything as elegant as that; but\r\nnewspaper men, young and old, were in the habit of dropping in upon Mr.\r\nWhitney quite informally. About ten, they might be asked down to the\r\ndining-room, where there was a dainty little spread, sometimes a Welsh\r\nrarebit that Dele could concoct to perfection. To be sure, they smoked\r\nthe room blue; and Mr. Whitney often brought out a bottle of wine, as\r\nwas the custom then; true, he waited until Delia and Nora had gone\r\nupstairs, and taken some of the younger men. Delia had made a strong\r\nprotest against it, in her humourous way.\r\n\r\n\"I don't so much mind you old fellows, who, if you haven't sense enough\r\nnot to addle your brains, never will have. But the young men oughtn't\r\nhave the temptation thrust in their way. They think it looks smart and\r\nmanly; and they make themselves so silly that I'm like a lump of ice to\r\nsome of them. I like clear-brained people.\"\r\n\r\nSo upstairs they had music and recitations. Every young man of any\r\nelocutionary ability felt himself empowered to recite \"The Raven,\" that\r\nmuch admired and sharply discussed poem by the Poet Poe, whose\r\nmelancholy end still created much interest. Critical spirit ran high.\r\nOne party could see only a morbid faculty heightened by opium and\r\nintoxicants; others found the spirit of true and fine genius in many of\r\nhis efforts, and believed the circumstances of his life had been against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nBen was reading one evening in Doctor Joe's cosy library, enjoying the\r\nmost capacious arm-chair, and improvising a foot-rest out of one not\r\nquite so luxurious. The Doctor had been making out bills, and feeling\r\nquite encouraged, perhaps lighter-hearted than he would when he had\r\nwaited a year for the payment of some of them.\r\n\r\n\"Joe,\" began his brother, abruptly, \"what do you suppose makes mother so\r\nbitter about Delia Whitney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bitter?\" repeated Joe, in the tone of indecision people often use when\r\na proposition or question takes them by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We all used to be so nice and jolly together, and Delia likes us\r\nall so much. Hanny has such good times down there, with the old lady who\r\nsings such pretty old-fashioned songs, if her voice is rather cracked\r\nand tremulous; and Nora is bright and entertaining. But the other day\r\nmother wouldn't let her go; and she was dreadfully disappointed; and\r\nmother is not as cordial to Delia as she used to be. Dele spoke of it.\"\r\n\r\nBen looked straight at his brother, out of the frankest of eyes. It was\r\nJoe who changed colour.\r\n\r\n\"I hate things to go crosswise. And when something keeps you just a\r\nlittle ruffled up all the time--\"\r\n\r\nBen drew his brows. Was he really unconscious of the trouble?\r\n\r\n\"You go there a good deal, you know. Some of the men are not quite the\r\ncompany a young fellow should choose, mother thinks.\"\r\n\r\nThat was begging the main issue, of course.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see much of the older men. They're mostly smoking downstairs,\r\nand I don't care a bit for that. But their talk is often worth listening\r\nto. People who just keep in one little round have no idea how rich the\r\nworld is growing intellectually, scientifically; and on what broad lines\r\nit is being laid.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the men altogether. Ben, you don't go anywhere else. Perhaps\r\nit would be wisdom to enlarge your acquaintance among girls, young\r\nladies,\" and Joe gave a short laugh that betrayed the effort.\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a penny for girls in general,\" said Ben, with elderly\r\ngravity. \"Delia sometimes asks them in; and we seldom have as good a\r\ntime. She's a host in herself; and I've always liked her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't had a very wide experience. And you are too young to make\r\nup your mind about--anything.\"\r\n\r\nBen started up suddenly and flushed. What a fine, strong, solid face he\r\nhad! It wasn't the face of one turned about with every wind of doctrine;\r\nit was not as handsome as Jim's bid fair to be, but it had hardly a weak\r\nor selfish line in it. Ben had always been such a good, generous, steady\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean,\" he began with a little gasp,--\"Joe, you can't think\r\nthat mother--that any one would object if the time came for me to--to\r\nmarry Delia?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too young to think of such things, Ben,\" said his brother,\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\"Why--I've been thinking of it ever since Mr. Theodore came home. We\r\nwere talking one time about going to Europe--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you really engaged, Ben?\"\r\n\r\nThe young fellow laughed and blushed.\r\n\r\n\"Well--I suppose not exactly,\" he answered slowly. \"We've never come to\r\nthat boshy stuff you find now and then in stories. But we know all about\r\neach other's plans; and we like so many of the same things; and we\r\nalways feel so comfortable together, not a bit as if we were trigged up\r\nin Sunday clothes. I don't think she's the most beautiful girl in the\r\nworld; but she has lovely eyes, and I've never seen a handsome girl I\r\nhave liked as well. Steve chose his own wife, and so did John.\r\nCleanthe's a splendid housekeeper; but she doesn't have time to read a\r\nnewspaper. Dolly's well informed, and has something fresh to talk about.\r\nBut it seems to me Margaret is always caring about society and\r\netiquette, and who is in our set, and a hundred things that bore me.\r\nPhil has all his life been used to style, so Margaret's just the one for\r\nhim. And why shouldn't I have just the one for me?\"\r\n\r\nJoe laughed heartily then.\r\n\r\n\"I'd wait a year or two,\" he answered drily. \"You are not out of your\r\ntime; and it is an unwise thing to take the responsibilities of life too\r\nearly. Delia may fancy some one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, she won't,\" replied Ben, confidently. \"We just suit. I can't\r\nexplain it to you, Joe; but it is one of the things that seem to come\r\nabout without any talking. Are some things ordained? I should be awful\r\nsorry to have mother object to it; but I know Dolly would stand by us\r\nwhen the time came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--don't hurry; and, Ben, take the little comments patiently. If\r\nmother was convinced that it was for your happiness, she would consent.\r\nWe all know there are unwise marriages, unhappy ones, as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we're not in any hurry! You see, Delia is really needed at home.\r\nThe old aunt is awfully fond of her. And she's so interested in her\r\nstories. We have such fun planning them out; and she does some capital\r\nlittle sketches.\"\r\n\r\nJoe nodded in a friendly manner, as if he did not altogether disapprove.\r\nBut there was a belief that literary women could not make good wives.\r\nPeople quoted Lady Bulwer and Lady Byron; and yet right in the city were\r\nwomen of literary proclivities living happily with their husbands.\r\n\r\nAnd Joe had found careless, fretful, indifferent wives and poor\r\nhousekeepers among women who could not even have written a coherent\r\naccount-book. Come to think, he liked Delia a good deal himself. And if\r\nshe wasn't such a great worker, she did have the art of making a\r\ncheerful, attractive home, and putting everybody at ease.\r\n\r\nThe new woman and cooking-schools were in the far future. Every mother,\r\nif she knew enough, trained her daughter to make a good wife, to buy\r\nproperly, to cook appetisingly if not always hygienically, to make her\r\nhusband's shirts, and do the general family sewing, to keep her house\r\norderly, to fight moths and mice, and to give company teas with the best\r\nchina and the finest tablecloth.\r\n\r\nTo be sure there was a little seething of unrest. Mrs. Bloomer had put\r\nforth a new costume that shocked the feminine world, though they were\r\ncomplaining of the weight of heavy skirts and the various devices for\r\ndistending them. Lucretia Mott and some other really fine women were\r\nadvocating the wider education of the sex. Women were being brought to\r\nthe fore as teachers in schools, and higher institutions were being\r\ndiscussed. There was a Mrs. Bishop who had preached; there were women\r\nwho lectured on various subjects.\r\n\r\nThe sewing-machine was making its way; and the argument in its favour\r\nwas that it would save a woman's strength and give her more leisure. But\r\nemployment of any kind out of the house _was_ considered derogatory\r\nunless one had no father or brother to supply her needs.\r\n\r\nStill, the old simple life was going out of date. There was more style;\r\nand some leaders of opinion professed to be shocked at the extravagance\r\nof the day. There was a sudden influx of people up-town. There were new\r\nstores and offices. One wondered where all the people came from. But New\r\nYork had taken rapid strides in her merchant-marine. The fastest vessels\r\nin the China trade went out of her ports. The time to both California\r\nand China was shortened by the flying clippers. The gold of that\r\nwonderful land of Ophir was the magic ring that one had only to rub, if\r\nhe could get hold of it, and work wonders.\r\n\r\nBut the little girl went on her quiet way. They were finding friends in\r\nthe new neighbourhood; yet Daisy Jasper could not be superseded. Every\r\nletter was carefully treasured; and, oh, how many things she found to\r\nsay in return.\r\n\r\nThey kept up the intimacy with the Deans, though Josephine seemed almost\r\na young woman. Mr. Reed enjoyed the pleasant home wonderfully. Charles\r\nspent much of his leisure over music, of which he was passionately fond.\r\nHe and Jim were not so intimate. Jim was going with a gayer lot of young\r\nfellows, while Charles was seriously considering his life-plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nAMONG GREAT THINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nWere people more enthusiastic in old New York than they are at the end\r\nof the century? We have done so much, we have had so many wonderful\r\nhappenings since then. To be sure, Dickens had been over and made,\r\npeople thought, a somewhat caustic return for the hospitable welcome;\r\nHarriet Martineau had made a tour, and gone home rather favourably\r\nimpressed; and the winter before the intellectual circle--and it was\r\ngetting to be quite notable--had honoured the Swedish novelist,\r\nFrederica Bremer, and been really charmed by her unaffected sweetness.\r\nIf they were not quite ready to take up her theories for the advancement\r\nof women, they fell to reading the delightful \"Neighbours\" and \"Home.\"\r\nAnd now there was to be another visitant, \"The Swedish Nightingale.\"\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Barnum was still the prince of entertainers. Theatres waxed and\r\nwaned, and new stars came to the front who had still their laurels to\r\nwin; people strove for cards to the Steven's Terrace, just back of\r\nColumbia College on Park Place. Bleecker Street was not out of date,\r\nthough Mrs. Hamilton Fish had gone up to Stuyvesant Square, and was\r\ngathering about her a political clique. There were card-parties and\r\ndances; there were Christy's Minstrels and the Hutchinson family; and\r\nsome of the more intellectual circles had conversaziones where the best\r\ntalent displayed itself. Still, Barnum could not be crowded out. No\r\nsarcasm withered him; and his variety was infinite. It was a safe place\r\nfor mothers to go and take their children. The men had formed several\r\nambitious clubs, and were beginning to entertain themselves.\r\n\r\nJenny Lind had already captivated Europe. Mr. Barnum judiciously brought\r\ninterest up to fever heat. After the bargain was made known, and the\r\nyoung singer had taken her passage with her suite, a musical rage\r\npervaded the very city. The streets leading to the wharf were thronged\r\nby crowds in the wildest enthusiasm. Triumphal arches were built across\r\nCanal Street, and as she came down the gang-plank of the steamer, shouts\r\nrent the very air.\r\n\r\nThe young traveller and poet, Bayard Taylor, had captured the prize\r\noffered for the finest ode to be sung at her first concert. Two hundred\r\ndollars seemed a large price at that time, as Tennyson had not been\r\noffered a thousand for a poem. So great was the inquiry for tickets,\r\nthat they were sold at auction a few days previous. And Mr. Genin, a\r\nBroadway hatter, signalised himself by making the highest bid for a\r\nticket,--two hundred and twenty-five dollars. Over one thousand tickets\r\nwere sold on the first day.\r\n\r\nThe concert was to be at Castle Garden. At five, the doors were opened,\r\nand people began to throng in, though each seat had been secured to its\r\nproper owner; and by eight, the audience was in a perfect transport of\r\nexpectation. It was said to be the largest audience assembled to listen\r\nto her. And when she was led on the stage by her manager, the enthusiasm\r\nwas beyond description. It seemed to divine beforehand that the\r\nfair-haired Swedish songstress would meet all expectations; and she\r\npassed beyond it.\r\n\r\nBen had been caught by the enthusiasm, and squandered his savings on a\r\nticket. He and Jim had been in the crowd around the hotel, that first\r\nnight when the New York musical society had serenaded her, and she had\r\nbowed from the old stone balcony to the admiring crowds.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't any word to express it,\" declared Ben, at the\r\nbreakfast-table the next morning. \"Joe, you must hear her, and\r\nHanny--all of you. Never mind the cost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben, you have lost your senses,\" said his mother, with a touch of her\r\nold sharpness. \"As if we were all millionaires! And I have heard people\r\nsing before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not anything like that. You can't imagine such melody. And the\r\nenthusiasm of the crowd is worth something!\"\r\n\r\nThe little girl looked up wistfully. She was beginning to understand the\r\nvalue of money.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" returned Joe; \"Hanny must hear her. I wouldn't have her miss it\r\nfor anything. But the tickets won't be so high after a little.\"\r\n\r\nThey dropped to regular prices, but that was high for the times; and the\r\nrush continued unabated. New York broke out in a Jenny Lind furore.\r\nThere were gloves, and hats, and shawls, and gowns, beautiful little\r\ntables, and consoles, and furniture of all sorts that bore her name. The\r\nbakers made Jenny Lind cake. What a time there was! Enthusiastic adorers\r\ntook her carriage from its shafts, and dragged it from Castle Garden to\r\nthe hotel. Was New York old in those days? Rather, it was the glowing,\r\nfervid impetuosity of early youth.\r\n\r\nAnd the serenade, when Broadway was jammed for blocks, and lighted by\r\ntorches in the street, and illuminations in the houses and stores. There\r\nwas a wonderful cornetist, Koenig, who could have won another Eurydice\r\nfrom the shades with his playing. Out on the balcony he stood and moved\r\nthe crowd with his melody. Then she came out beside him, and, in the\r\nhush, a thousand times more appreciative than the wildest applause, the\r\nmagnificent voice sang to its large, free audience, \"Home, Sweet Home,\"\r\nas no one will ever hear it sung again. That alone would be fame enough\r\nfor any writer of song!\r\n\r\nThe furore did not abate. But they must all go,--Stephen and Dolly,\r\nMargaret and her husband, Joe and the little girl, and her father.\r\n\r\n\"It is nonsense for an old fellow like me,\" he declared, half\r\nhumourously.\r\n\r\n\"But I shall like it so much better, and then we can talk it over\r\nafterward. That's half the pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked so wistful out of her soft eyes, and patted his hand with her\r\ncaressing little fingers, of course he couldn't say No.\r\n\r\nIt was so much harder to persuade Mrs. Underhill. \"It certainly _was_\r\nwicked to spend so much money just to hear one woman sing. She had heard\r\nthe 'Messiah,' with Madame Anna Bishop in it; and she never again\r\nexpected to hear anything so beautiful this side of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThey carried the day, however, in spite of her objections. Castle Garden\r\nlooked like fairyland, with its brilliant lights, its hundred ushers in\r\nwhite gloves and rosettes, their wands tipped with ribbon as if for some\r\ngrand ball. The quiet was awe-inspiring. One did not even want to\r\nwhisper to his neighbour, but just sit in fascinated silence and wonder\r\nwhat it would be like.\r\n\r\nThen Jenny Lind was led on the stage, and the entire audience rose with\r\none vast, deafening cheer,--a magnificent one, as hearty as on her first\r\nnight. It seemed as if they would never stop. There was a cloud of\r\nwaving handkerchiefs, shaking out fragrance in the air.\r\n\r\nA simple Swedish maiden in her gown of soft, white silk, with no blaze\r\nof diamonds, and just one rose low down in her banded hair, only her\r\ngracious sweetness and simplicity, a thousand times finer and more\r\neffective than flashing beauty. She has heard the applause many a time\r\nbefore, in audiences of crowned heads; and this from the multitude is\r\njust as sweet.\r\n\r\nWhen all is listening, attentive silence, she begins \"Casta Diva.\" \"Hark\r\nto the voice,\" and every one listens with such intensity that the\r\nmagnificent sound swells out and fills the farthest space. There is no\r\nstriving for effect. A woman singing with a God-given voice, in simple\r\nthanks for its ownership, not a queen bidding for admiration. Had any\r\nvoice ever made such glorious melody, or so stirred human souls?\r\n\r\nThe applause has in it an immensity of appreciation, as if it could\r\nnever get itself wholly expressed.\r\n\r\nThen another favourite, which everybody sang at for years afterward: \"I\r\ndreamt I dwelt in marble halls.\" In some of the sorrows of her\r\nwomanhood, the little girl was to recall the sweet refrain--\r\n\r\n    \"That you loved me still the same.\"\r\n\r\nThen \"Comin' thro' the Rye,\" with a lilt and dainty deliciousness that\r\none never can forget. But \"Home, Sweet Home,\" moves to tears and\r\nenthusiasm. Surely, no voice ever put such pathos, such marvellous\r\nsweetness, into it!\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes now, when the little girl looks over to the other country,\r\none of the many joys she thinks will be hearing such blessed voices as\r\nJenny Lind's and Parepa Rosa's. You could not shake her faith in\r\nimmortality and all these precious joys to come.\r\n\r\nShe was quite a heroine at school for many days to come. People did not\r\nthink it worth while to spend so much money on children at that time.\r\n\r\nMargaret and her mother had compromised on the school question, or\r\nrather Margaret had yielded.\r\n\r\nHanny would graduate at the end of the year. Margaret preferred a\r\nstylish boarding-school after that. The Hoffmans were quite in the swim\r\nof that period. The Doctor's connections, and Margaret's beauty, made\r\nthem welcome in circles that were beginning to grow a little exclusive,\r\nand demand grandfathers for vouchers. There was a little talk, even\r\nthen, about _nouveaux riches_; but, after all, no one seemed to\r\nabsolutely despise wealth.\r\n\r\nMargaret was really very ambitious for the younger members of the\r\nfamily. Jim, with his good looks and the brightness that was akin to\r\nwit, was her favourite. Then he took naturally to elegance.\r\n\r\nDolly was very happy and jolly with her husband and children. They lived\r\nin a very pleasant manner; and society courted Dolly as well. Stephen\r\nwas prospering wonderfully, and had a fine standing among business-men.\r\n\r\nHanny was extravagantly fond of the children. Stevie called her Auntie\r\nNan, now; but Annie said simply Nan. Margaret had adopted it as well.\r\nHannah was rather awkward and old-fashioned. Even Ben sometimes\r\nwarbled,--\r\n\r\n    \"Nannie, wilt thou gang wi' me?\"\r\n\r\nShe had another great and unexpected treat a few weeks later. She had\r\ngone on Friday to make a real visit at Dolly's, and go from there to\r\nschool on Monday morning. And, fortunately for her, she had taken her\r\nbest Sunday frock, which she was wearing a good deal lest she might\r\noutgrow it.\r\n\r\nAnd who should drop in but Delia Whitney. Whether Dolly suspected all\r\nwas not clear sailing for the young people, no one could have told from\r\nher friendly manner. She had taken quite a liking to Delia, and was much\r\ninterested in her success.\r\n\r\nThey talked over the Jenny Lind concert. Delia had attended two. She was\r\ngoing about quite a good deal among literary people.\r\n\r\n\"And to-morrow night, The. and I are going to take Ben to the Osgoods.\r\nOh, Hanny, that's the author of the little song you sing:--\r\n\r\n    \"'I love you, I adore you; but\r\n    I'm talking in my sleep.'\r\n\r\nAnd she's just lovely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" cried Hanny, \"I should like to see her, truly. You know I told you\r\nabout seeing her in the carriage when she went up to Mr. Poe's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, can't you go? The. has a standing invitation to bring friends.\r\nWhy, Nora has gone! She sang up there one evening, and did wonderfully\r\nwell. Her teacher thinks in a year or two she can try concerts; only it\r\nisn't best to strain her voice now. And you may see some famous people,\r\nand some yet to be famous, myself among them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't care about the others,\" said Hanny, naïvely. \"And if you\r\nare quite sure--Dolly, ought I to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" answered Dolly. \"It's fortunate that you brought your best\r\nfrock; though we could have sent for it. Why, yes, if you would like\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\nHanny drew a long breath. Twice of late her mother had found excuses\r\nwhen she had asked to go down to Beach Street. She, too, had a vague\r\nfeeling there was something in the air; but her simple nature was not\r\nsuspicious. And it wasn't like going to the Whitney's. She couldn't do\r\nsuch a thing without asking permission.\r\n\r\nDelia finished her call, kissed the babies and Hanny, and said they\r\nwould all be up at eight, sharp.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have Hanny in apple-pie order,\" answered Dolly, with her bright\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\nStephen was delightful in his family; and he had the same odd little\r\nlook in his eye as her father, suggestive of fun. He was teaching her to\r\nplay checkers; and, although Dolly helped sometimes, she found it hard\r\nwork to beat him. Dolly sat by embroidering.\r\n\r\nThe next morning they drove down-town and did some shopping, and called\r\non Annette, who made them stay to luncheon. Mrs. Beekman was quite\r\npoorly now, and had grown very, very stout. She said, \"she had lost all\r\nher ambition. It was a great thing to be young, and have all your life\r\nbefore you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was so delightful; and Dolly was sure they wouldn't have many more\r\nsuch Indian summery days, so they went over to Washington Parade-ground,\r\nwhere the style promenaded on Saturday afternoon. Hanny wore her best\r\ndress and a pretty cloth cape trimmed with a little edge of fur. They\r\ntook Stevie, who was delighted of course, and who ran about, very proud\r\nof his new jacket and trousers.\r\n\r\nMany of the promenaders nodded to young Mrs. Stephen Underhill. Belles\r\nand beaux went by; prettily dressed children; stylish little boys, who\r\ncarried canes, and had long tassels drooping over one side of their\r\ncaps. Hanny enjoyed it all very much.\r\n\r\nThen after supper, Dolly put a fine lace tucker over the edging at the\r\nneck of her frock, and found a blue sash, and curled her hair so as to\r\nmake it all wavy at the edge of her forehead; and there was a very\r\nsweet, attractive girl, if she wasn't a beauty.\r\n\r\nMr. Theodore Whitney seemed very much amused and pleased, and politely\r\ninquired if he might be Miss Underhill's escort. Delia looked unusually\r\nnice in her new brown silk and some beautiful old lace Aunt Clem had\r\ngiven her.\r\n\r\nPeople did not wait until ten o'clock for \"functions\" to begin; neither\r\ndid they give them that uneuphonious name. Hanny had read and heard a\r\ngood deal since her first visit to genius in the plain, poor, little\r\ncottage; and this certainly had more of the true aspect one connects\r\nwith poesy. The two rooms were daintily furnished; pictures everywhere.\r\nMr. Osgood was a painter, and his portraits were quite celebrated. The\r\ncurtains fell with a graceful sweep. The light brocade of the chairs\r\nthrew out glisteny shades; the little tables set about held books and\r\nengravings, and great portfolios leaned against the wall. There was a\r\ncase of choicely-bound books, and an open piano. Flowers were in vases\r\non brackets, and low, quaint china bowls. It was like a lovely picture\r\nto the little girl; but she felt afraid of the people talking so\r\nearnestly, and wondered if they were all poets and authors.\r\n\r\nThe party greeted their hostess, and Hanny was introduced. Was it the\r\nglamour of the summer and the blue gown that had made Mrs. Osgood so\r\nlovely sitting there in the carriage? Now she was thin, and her hair was\r\nbanded down in the fashion of the day; then it had been flying in\r\nringlets. Her gown was black silk, and that made her look rather grave;\r\nbut when she smiled, all the old sweetness was there. Hanny knew her\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nDelia took charge of Hanny, and seated her by a table with a book of\r\nchoice engravings. Ben had found some one he knew, and Mr. Whitney had\r\ngone to talk to General Morris. A tall young lady came over and began\r\ncomplimenting Miss Whitney on her story in Godey's, and Delia flushed up\r\nwith pleasure. Then she begged to introduce her to a friend. She wrote\r\nverses only, and her friend had composed music for them.\r\n\r\nHanny kept watching her hostess. She knew some of the guests, from\r\nhaving had them pointed out to her in the street. There was Mr. Greeley,\r\nthin of face and careless of attire in those early days. In the street\r\nhe could always be told by a shaggy light coat that he wore.\r\n\r\nA very sweet-looking elderly lady came up presently and spoke to Delia,\r\nwho was in full flow of eager talk with the young musical composer.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that your sister, or your niece,--the one who sang here some time\r\nago? I saw her come in with Mr. Whitney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" returned Delia. \"But she is a very dear friend,--Mr.\r\nUnderhill's sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stephen Underhill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, she is his sister; but it is Mr. Ben Underhill who is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know Mr. and Mrs. Stephen Underhill very well. She was a Beekman. And\r\nDr. Hoffman's wife belongs to the family.\"\r\n\r\nDelia turned and introduced Mrs. Kirtland.\r\n\r\nShe had such an attractive face, framed in with rows of snowy puffs,\r\nquite gone out of date, but becoming to her nevertheless.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that I almost know you,\" she said sweetly, \"though I half\r\nmistook you for Miss Whitney; but she is dark, and you are fair, so I\r\nought not to have made the blunder. I know your brother Stephen and his\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" Hanny gave it a glad little sound, and smiled, as she put out her\r\nsmall hand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kirtland took the unoccupied seat.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you have hardly begun life, you look so young. But no doubt\r\nyou are a genius of some sort. Mrs. Osgood is so extraordinarily good to\r\nyoung geniuses.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I haven't any genius,\" and Hanny flushed, as she gave a beguiling\r\nsmile that lighted up her face. \"And though there are a good many of\r\nus, we have not even a family genius.\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon whether you restrict the word to painting a picture\r\nor writing a poem or a story. Mr. Stephen Underhill is very highly\r\nspoken of as one of the promising young business-men. And is it your\r\nbrother who was in the office of old Dr. Fitch, and in the hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, ma'am,\" returned Hanny, with a glow of pleasure. Young people were\r\nstill expected to say \"Yes, sir,\" and \"Yes, ma'am,\" to their elders, out\r\nof respect.\r\n\r\n\"That does very well for one family, though the Whitneys seem to have a\r\ngood share. Miss Delia is quite a success, I hear. And we always find\r\nMr. Whitney very entertaining. Have you known them long?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for years, seven almost. And we used to be neighbours.\"\r\n\r\n\"A friendship is said to be certain when you have held it seven years.\r\nHave you met Mrs. Osgood before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am; but I saw her quite a long while ago at Fordham.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Fordham! Then you must have known the poet Edgar Allan Poe.\"\r\n\r\n\"A little,\" returned Hanny, timidly.\r\n\r\n\"There's such a romance to his life at that place,--his lovely young\r\nwife dying, and the devotion of Mrs. Clemm. Oh, tell me about your\r\nepisode!\"\r\n\r\nHanny told the story, very simply, charmingly as well.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" exclaimed Mrs. Kirtland, \"Frances must hear that!\" Then she\r\nglanced around. Mrs. Osgood was no longer receiving guests, but mingling\r\nwith the company. Some one was going to the piano; and everybody\r\nlistened to an exquisite voice singing a beautiful Italian melody. When\r\nthat was finished, a young man who was to be famous in after years read\r\na sweet, simple poem that touched every one's heart. Then the talk began\r\nin little groups again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Kirtland signalled to her hostess, who came over to them.\r\n\r\n\"Frances,\" she said, \"here is a youthful worshipper who remembers you as\r\na lovely lady all in cerulean blue, and with long curls, going up to the\r\nPoe cottage. See how you have lived in the child's memory. And she sings\r\na song of yours.\"\r\n\r\nHanny's face was scarlet for a moment; but Mrs. Osgood sat down beside\r\nher, and they talked of the poet and Mrs. Clemm, and touched lightly\r\nupon the sad after-happenings. He had at one time been a frequent guest.\r\nThere was even yet a deep interest in him, though opinion was sharply\r\ndivided. And Mrs. Osgood had known the beautiful Virginia, whose sad\r\nfate even then was hardly realised. They talked a little about \"Annabel\r\nLee\" and the \"high-born kinsman;\" and Hanny thought she had a delightful\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThere was coffee and chocolate and lemonade, with plates of dainty cakes\r\nand confectionery, in an ante-room. Then a gentleman sang a\r\nhunting-song in a fine tenor voice; and another paper on Art was read.\r\n\r\nIf people came early, they also dispersed at a reasonable hour. It was\r\nnot quite ten when Delia, Hanny, and Ben made their adieus to the\r\nhostess, who stooped and kissed Hanny for \"old remembrance' sake,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nMr. Whitney was going down with some of the older men. Ben saw his\r\nlittle sister safe in Stephen's hands, and then went on with Delia.\r\n\r\n\"I've had such a splendid time!\" exclaimed Hanny. \"I wouldn't have\r\nmissed it for the world.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she told the home-folks about it, her mother made no comment; but\r\nJoe and her father were very much interested. And when, not long after\r\nthat, \"the high-born kinsman\" came for the charming woman who had given\r\nmuch pleasure in her brief way through the world, and who had not\r\ndisdained to write a verse and her name in many a society album, Hanny\r\nfelt quite as if she had lost a dear friend.\r\n\r\nTwo other poets, sisters, Alice and Ph[oe]be Cary, came to New York, and\r\nheld receptions that were quite famous as time went on. To be sure,\r\nthere was the old name of blue-stocking applied to them now and then;\r\nfor people, women especially, were taking a wider interest in other\r\naffairs beside literature, prefiguring the new woman. Miss Delia Whitney\r\nwas very much interested. They were not quite up to clubs in those days,\r\nor she would have been a charter-member.\r\n\r\nBut the child Hanny had enough to do to study her lessons, practise her\r\nmusic, and make her visits, with a little sewing in between. She did\r\nmake her father a set of shirts; but underclothing of all kinds was\r\nbeing manufactured; and though the older-fashioned women sneered at it,\r\nas rather poor stuff, the men seemed to like it. At gentlemen's\r\nfurnishing stores, you could buy shirts cut and made in the latest\r\nstyle, the neckbands of which always seemed to fit, or else the men\r\ndiscreetly refrained from grumbling when they had spent so much money.\r\nAnd women began to find it eased their burdens.\r\n\r\nNo one wanted home-knit stockings, the English and French and Germans\r\nsent us such perfect ones. White was still all the style, unless you\r\nwore black, or blossom-coloured silk. Of course there were common people\r\nwho put slate-colour on their children, because white made so much\r\nwashing. And as for pantalets, there were none left.\r\n\r\nThere were other people called away beside poets, and changes made in\r\nfamilies. Grandmother Underhill went to the country wherein the faithful\r\nabide, and Aunt Katrina. Grandmother Van Kortlandt came to make her home\r\nwith her daughter. Aunt Crete and Cousin Joanna Morgan, and here and\r\nthere some of the old people, as well as the young, passed over the\r\nnarrow river.\r\n\r\nBut there seemed new babies all around. Dolly and Margaret had little\r\nsons, and Cleanthe a daughter. John was quite jealous of Hanny's notice;\r\nfor his little girl was fair, and had light hair, and they were quite\r\nsure it looked like her. John wanted to call her Hannah Ann.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Hanny; \"there are so many beautiful names now!\" Then she\r\nlaughed. \"I shall not promise her a hundred dollars, nor my string of\r\ngold beads. I am not sorry, for I have loved both grandmothers; and one\r\nis gone--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't we name her after _her_ grandmothers?\" exclaimed Cleanthe.\r\n\"One of hers is gone,\" and she sighed. \"It seems such a long name for a\r\nwee baby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Margaret Elizabeth,--it is a beautiful name,\" said Hanny, with delight.\r\n\"Mother will give her something, I know. And I will be her godmother,\r\nand endow her for the Elizabeth.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all your worldly goods?\" asked John.\r\n\r\n\"Not _quite_ all--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be impoverished, Hanny,\" interrupted John, with a glint of\r\nhumour. \"Six nephews and nieces already! And there are four of us still\r\nto marry, if George ever comes back. He hasn't made his fortune yet. He\r\nwas crazy to go. The good times here suit me well enough.\"\r\n\r\nGrandmother Underhill put fifty dollars in the bank for the new baby,\r\nand gave it a silver spoon. Hanny gave her a silver cup with her name\r\nengraved on it, and, with Dolly's help, made her a beautiful christening\r\nrobe, which Cleanthe saved up for her, the sewing and tucking on it was\r\nso exquisite. She used to show it to visitors with a great deal of\r\npride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF ROMANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was Saratoga and Newport; and Long Branch laid claim to some\r\ndistinction; even Cape May was not unknown to fame,--still the Jersey\r\ncoast, with all its magnificent possibilities, really had not been\r\ndiscovered, and was rather contemptuously termed sand wastes. It was\r\ngetting to be quite the thing to go off awhile in the summer. Some of\r\nthe style had spent a \"season\" in London, and seen the young Queen and\r\nthe Prince Consort and the royal children, and gone over to Paris to see\r\n\"the nephew of his uncle,\" who was taking a hand in the new French\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nBut plain people still visited their relatives a good deal. Ben had\r\ntaken a holiday, and gone up to Tarrytown after Hanny; and they had made\r\npilgrimages along to different cousins. They sat on the old porch at\r\nFordham; but one of the cousins was married, and gone to her own home,\r\ntaken the tall, bright-eyed young man who had been about so much the\r\nolden summer.\r\n\r\nIt was really a delightful walk over there. Ben was finding out odd\r\nplaces for Delia, who was now interested in some Revolutionary sketches.\r\nThey had explored Kingsbridge; they had found Featherbed Lane; they\r\nlearned the Harlem River once had borne the Indian name of Umscoota.\r\nHere, more than forty years before, Robert Macomb had built his dam, in\r\ndefiance of certain national laws, as he wanted a volume of water for\r\nhis mill.\r\n\r\nMany and ineffectual were the efforts made to remove it by the\r\nsurrounding property-owners who had large and beautiful estates. For no\r\none dreamed then that the great city would sometime absorb everything,\r\nand that here was to stand a beautiful bridge, the pride of the city.\r\nBut the old dam was one dark night assaulted by a \"piratical craft,\"\r\nthat demanded entrance, and, on being refused a right through the\r\nwaterway, demolished the old affair; and the freed and happy river went\r\non to the sea unvexed, and still kept Manhattan an island, to be bridged\r\nover as convenience required.\r\n\r\nDown in one of the pretty valleys was the home of Cousin Jennie, that\r\nHanny always connected with Mrs. Clemm and the poet. All about were\r\ngreen fields and orchards, hills and valleys. Between them and the\r\nHarlem lay a high wooded ridge from whose top you could see the Hudson,\r\nand the Harlem was like a cord winding in and out of green valleys.\r\nThere was Fort George and Harlem plains; and Hanny recalled the two old\r\nUnderhill ladies whose lives had reached back to Revolutionary times.\r\n\r\nThey rambled about the historic ground, peaceful enough then. There was\r\nthe old Poole house, the De Voe house, and further up the Morris\r\nmansion. What names they recalled!--Washington, Rochambeau, the Hessian\r\nGeneral Knyphausen.\r\n\r\nAnd then Cousin Jennie's husband pointed out a place with a romantic\r\nstory. When the Hessian Army had swept on in the steps of General\r\nWashington's retreating men, they had been encamped for some time,\r\nforaging about for food and demanding supplies of the farmers,--an\r\nill-fed, and ill-clothed set of conscripts, without much enthusiasm,\r\nmany of them torn from home and friends, neither knowing nor caring\r\nabout the land where they had gone to fight, and perhaps lay their\r\nbones.\r\n\r\nAmong them a young fellow, Anthony Woolf by name, whose mother, in a\r\ndistrict in distant Germany, had yielded to the blandishments of a\r\nsecond husband, thus rendering her son liable to conscription, as he was\r\nno longer her sole protector. Young Anthony knew his stepfather grudged\r\nhim the broad acres of his patrimony, and guessed whose influence had\r\nsent the press-gang one night, and hurried him off, without even a\r\ngood-bye to his mother, to the nearest seaport town, and there embarked\r\nhim for a perilous ocean-journey, to fight against people struggling for\r\ntheir liberty.\r\n\r\nHe had fought, like many of the others, under a sort of rebellious\r\nprotest. Several had deserted: some joining the American army from\r\nsympathy. But Anthony was sick of carnage and marching and\r\nsemi-starvation. Winter was coming on. So, one night, he stole out\r\nunperceived, and hurried down to the river's edge. On the other side,\r\nat some distance, he could see a faint gleam of light between the\r\nleafless trees. He had watched it longingly. There were many kindly\r\ndisposed people who gave shelter to deserters. He threw off his heavy\r\ncoat, and his boots, with the soles worn through, and made a plunge. The\r\nwater was cold, the way longer than it looked; but he buffeted across\r\nand crawled out in the autumn blast, dripping and shivering, and ran up\r\nto the kitchen steps, that looked more friendly than the great wide\r\nporch and stately doorway. The maids were frightened, and a man came, to\r\nwhom he told his story in broken English, and was taken in, warmed and\r\nfed and clothed, and kept out of sight for several days.\r\n\r\nIn his gratitude and delight, he made himself useful. He had been\r\naccustomed to farming and herds and flocks. The old Morris estate was\r\nlarge; and when the British Army was safely out of the way, there was\r\nwork in plenty; and a faithful hand Anthony Woolf proved.\r\n\r\nWhen the long summer days came the next year, there was no end of\r\nspinning in the great house, where linen and woollen were made for the\r\nfamily use. The farmers' daughters used to be eager for the chances; and\r\none day, when pretty Phebe Oakley's grandmother was going over to the\r\ngreat house, as it was so often called, the young girl begged her to\r\nspeak a good word for her, as she could spin both wool and flax.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be glad to have you,\" said grandmother on her return. \"But,\r\nPhebe, they have a young Woolf over there; so look out he doesn't catch\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nPhebe tossed her head. She was in no hurry to be caught. And yet it so\r\nfell out that when Anthony Woolf had saved up a little money, and\r\nnegotiated for a farm over in the valley, he caught pretty Phebe Oakley,\r\nand built a house for her, and prospered.\r\n\r\nThey looked at the place where the Hessian Army had been encamped, and\r\ntraced the course of the young fellow's daring swim. And here was the\r\nold part of the house he had built, and where he had outlived his own\r\nson, but left grandsons behind him, one of whom had married Cousin\r\nJennie. Grandmother was still alive,--a little, rather-faded, and\r\nshrunken old lady who had once been pretty Phebe Oakley, who lived with\r\nher daughter in the old part.\r\n\r\n\"There are lots of romances lying about unused,\" said Ben. \"I should\r\nlike to have a story-teller's gift myself.\"\r\n\r\nHanny was so interested in young Mr. Woolf that she had to tell Joe all\r\nthe story when she came home; and he said they must go up the historic\r\nHarlem some day. And he said Umscoota meant \"Stream among the green\r\nsedge.\"\r\n\r\nThis year it had to be Rutger's Institute for Hanny. There were a great\r\nmany new schools; but Dolly and Margaret carried the day. She thought at\r\nfirst she shouldn't like it at all; but when she came to know the girls,\r\nshe began to feel quite at home, and, in some queer fashion, as if she\r\nwere growing up. But she didn't seem to grow very fast.\r\n\r\nBen came to his twenty-first birthday. He was a tall, well-grown young\r\nfellow, and often surprised Jim by the amount of knowledge he possessed.\r\nAnd then he went over to the \"Tribune\" office, and sometimes tried his\r\nhand at queer, out-of-the-way bits of past lore that people were almost\r\nforgetting. Just how it came about, he never clearly remembered himself;\r\nbut one night, when Delia had seemed unusually attractive to three or\r\nfour young men who haunted the place, he rose abruptly and said he must\r\ngo. There was a set look in his usually pleasant face, and he shut his\r\nlips, as if something had displeased him.\r\n\r\nDelia went to the hall door. As he turned, she caught his arm.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Ben?\" she said in a hurried whisper. \"Something has\r\nhappened to vex you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something!\" with youthful bitterness. \"We never have any good times any\r\nmore. There's always such a crowd--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ben! Are you jealous? Why, you know I like you better than any of\r\nthem! Gordon only comes to get ideas; he's so very anxious to do\r\nsomething in literature. As if I could help anybody!\" and she laughed.\r\n\"The others come for fun. You're worth them all, Ben. Oh, don't go away\r\nangry!\" with a voice of tender pleading.\r\n\r\nBen felt suddenly foolish. Was he angry over such a trifle? Then he\r\nglanced up in Delia's face; he was on the step below. What was there in\r\nher eyes; and she had said she liked him better than any of them, even\r\nthat handsome Van Doren. Well, he was most jealous of Van Doren, who was\r\nin his last year at Columbia, and whose father was rich and indulgent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" he said with an indrawn breath, \"you must know that I love you.\r\nI've always loved you, I think.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her arms about his neck, and kissed him. It was very\r\nreprehensible, I suppose. Young people were honestly friendly in those\r\ndays, and seldom had a chaperone; yet they did not play at love, unless\r\nthey were real flirts; and a flirt soon gained an unenviable reputation.\r\n\r\n\"Come down a ways with me,\" he entreated, with a little tremulous sound\r\nin his voice that touched her.\r\n\r\nThe street was very quiet. He put his arm about her, and drew her close\r\nto his side.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's cool out here, and you've no wrap!\" He was suddenly very\r\ncareful of her. \"But I wanted to say--it isn't only a like, but a love.\r\nYou _do_ love me, Delia?\"\r\n\r\n\"I love you, love you! I love you and yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course we will have to wait. We are both young. But I'm doing a bit\r\nof outside work, and have a chance to come up--\"\r\n\r\n\"If we did marry, you'd have to come and live with me; for I have\r\npromised Aunt Patty never to leave her. I haven't really thought about\r\nmarriage. There is so much to my life all the time. Oh, yes, we can\r\nwait. But you must not feel afraid, Ben. I like fun and nonsense, and\r\nplenty of people to talk to. I'm not sure I shall make a good wife,\r\neven, though both of my sisters do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you, good or bad,\" said Ben, sturdily.\r\n\r\nThey both laughed, and then he kissed her again.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must go back! You'll get an awful cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never do take cold. I'll run like a flash. Come to-morrow night. Oh,\r\nBen!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Delia, my darling!\"\r\n\r\nThen she flew back. How long had she been gone? She re-entered the room\r\nwith a most nonchalant air; and in two minutes she had them all in a\r\nwhirl of conversation, even if they did look rather curious.\r\n\r\nBen sauntered up home. It was quite early. Hanny was upstairs reading to\r\ngrandmother, who went to bed at nine, and liked to have Hanny come in\r\nand read to her. Joe sat in his office, poring over an abstruse medical\r\narticle. He glanced up and nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Joe,\" the lad began, with a bright flush that gave a certain tenderness\r\nto his eyes, which were dewy sweet,--\"Joe, listen a minute. I am engaged\r\nto Delia Whitney,--just to-night. But I hate mean, underhand things. I\r\nwanted some one to know it. And--shall I tell mother? Of course she\r\nwon't like it; though I don't see why.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben, I don't believe I would just now. You are young, and you won't be\r\nmarried under a year or two. No, I would wait a little. She may settle\r\nto it presently,\" said the elder, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want her to feel hurt. I'd just like to go and tell her, I am\r\nso happy.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked so brave and manly that Joe was almost sorry not to send him.\r\nBut he _did_ know that his mother objected to it strenuously, and might\r\nsay something that would cut Ben to the heart.\r\n\r\nLatterly, he had been cherishing a vague belief that the affair would\r\nend in a sort of a good comradeship.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" Ben laid his hand on the elder's shoulder. \"You are a dear\r\ngood brother, Joe. Don't you suppose you will ever marry? No one will be\r\nquite good enough for you. You're a splendid fellow.\"\r\n\r\nJoe went back to his book; but it had lost interest. Well--it was rather\r\nqueer. He had been made very welcome in several houses; and Margaret had\r\ngiven delicate little suggestions. But he had never cared for any one.\r\nHe would be nine and twenty on his next birthday,--quite a bachelor.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat curious; but Ben, who had never cared for fixing up,\r\nthough he was always clean, suddenly developed a new care for his cuffs\r\nand collars, and indulged in light-coloured neckties, and gloves that he\r\ncould no longer \"run and jump in,\" as Jim had accused him of doing. He\r\nwent out Sunday evening to tea, which was a new thing, though he often\r\nstayed at the Whitneys' through the week. There was a certain air of\r\nbeing of supreme consequence to some one; Mrs. Underhill rather resented\r\nit.\r\n\r\nJim was very gay this winter. A good-looking young collegian who was\r\nbright and full of fun, and could sing college glees in a fine tenor\r\nvoice, tell a capital story, and dance well, was not likely to go\r\nbegging.\r\n\r\nOne evening he stumbled over his old friend Lily Ludlow, whom he had not\r\nseen for two years,--a tall, stylish girl, handsome in the ordinary\r\nacceptation of the word, but lacking some of the finer qualities, if you\r\nstudied her closely. There had been some great changes in her life. Her\r\nfather had died suddenly, leaving but small provision for them. Chris\r\nhad her hands full trying to live pretentiously on a rather small\r\nincome.\r\n\r\nThey had found an elderly aunt of Mr. Ludlow's who, in her day, had been\r\nquite a society woman. She had an old-fashioned but well furnished house\r\nin Amity Street, and had not given up all her acquaintances. The house\r\nwas to go to her husband's family when she was done with it, there being\r\nno children; and her income ended with her life, so there was nothing to\r\nexpect from her.\r\n\r\n\"But I do want a housekeeper and a nurse, sometimes,\" she said to\r\nMrs. Ludlow. \"If you like to fill the place, you will have a good home\r\nand good wages. And Lily's fine looks ought to get her a husband.\"\r\n\r\nAmity Street still had a rather select air, if its fashion was falling\r\noff a little. The house was old, but not out of date, and quite\r\nimposing; and the big doorplate, with \"Nicoll\" on it, stamped it as\r\nundeniably aristocratic, Miss Lily thought. She urged her mother to\r\naccept it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't feel as if I could be at that queer old woman's beck and call.\r\nI remember when we were first married she said some very mean things. My\r\nfamily was quite as good as your father's, Lily. Neither of his brothers\r\namounted to much, though his sister married a rich Southerner and went\r\noff to forget all her relatives. We've never asked anything of the\r\nLudlows, and I don't want to now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it will only be for a year or two. Of course I shall marry; and\r\nthen you will have two homes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd a sight rather go with Chris. And if you could teach--seems to me\r\nyou might, with your education. And you have had two lovers already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who couldn't take care of me. I am not going to marry that way. But, as\r\nAunt Nicoll says, 'We shall be sure of a good home.'\"\r\n\r\nLily gained her point. Early in the preceding spring they had gone to\r\nAmity Street. The spacious, old-fashioned parlours were a little out of\r\ndate, but had been elegant in their day. Lily laid off her mourning, and\r\nfell heir to some handsome gowns that Chris helped her remodel. Mrs.\r\nNicoll was queer and bad-tempered; and the difficulty had been to keep\r\nservants who would submit to such exactions. Matters went a little\r\nsmoother; but poor Mrs. Ludlow had to suffer.\r\n\r\nLily spent a month at Saratoga with Mrs. Nicoll and the maid. The old\r\nlady was a good deal entertained by the airs and graces and bright ways\r\nof her grand-niece. Lily made several conquests; but the desirable offer\r\nof marriage was not forth-coming.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nicoll gave a reception early in the season,--a thing she always\r\ndid; and her friends attended with a certain kindly feeling that she was\r\nold, and the duty might never be required of them again. Miss Lily made\r\nquite an impression; and cards and invitations were left for her. And\r\nwhen she attended a dance at the Apollo Rooms, the height of her\r\nambition was reached.\r\n\r\nAt a pretty private dance she met her school-day admirer again, and\r\ntried her charms, which had increased notably since that youthful\r\nperiod. She did dance beautifully, and had no lack of the small talk of\r\nthe day. Jim promised to call, and did so at an early date, rather\r\nsurprised at the solid elegance of the place. Lily expatiated skilfully\r\non dear old Aunt Nicoll, who _would_ have mother come and stay with her;\r\nsince they were alone it seemed the best thing to do; and Aunt Nicoll\r\nhad no near relatives of her own. There were plenty of her husband's\r\nfamily \"hungry for what she had,\" said Lily, with a sort of sneer, as if\r\nthey might find themselves mistaken in the end.\r\n\r\nCertainly, Jim thought, Lily had dropped in a clover-field. He found\r\nthat Mrs. Nicoll was considered a rich woman. Lily was handsomely\r\ndressed, and no doubt she would be kindly remembered in the old lady's\r\nwill. Not that Jim was speculating on any part or lot in the matter. He\r\nwas too young; he would have his three years in the law school, and\r\nafter that, getting established.\r\n\r\nLily begged him to bring some of his friends. The house was lonely, with\r\nno young people for companionship; and she raised her eyes in the old\r\npleading fashion that even now had quite an effect upon him.\r\n\r\nJim chose several young men that he associated with. Some of them had\r\nsisters, who declared Miss Ludlow charming. She was not anxious now to\r\nhave any of the Underhills on her visiting-list; but she did mean to\r\nmake use of Jim. She had grown quite worldly-wise and experienced.\r\n\r\nTwo of Jim's friends were generously supplied with pocket-money. One was\r\na young Virginian, Mr. Weir, the other, Harry Gaynor, and both spent\r\nlavishly. Flowers were costly then; and Lily was the recipient of many a\r\nhandsome bouquet. In return, she now and then gave a dainty supper,\r\nsimple to be sure, or a card-party, with some delightful confections,\r\nand a little coffee or chocolate. Mrs. Nicoll always retired early, and\r\ntook some drops to make sure of sleeping the first part of the night, so\r\nshe was not easily disturbed.\r\n\r\nThen there were stars at the theatres. Parodi was emulating Jenny Lind,\r\nwho had gone to Havana; and the houses were crowded, if the tickets were\r\nnot so high. It was so easy to spend money when an artful girl, with\r\nsoftest voice and bewitching eyes, planned for you. And it was so easy\r\nto borrow, when you had good friends.\r\n\r\nMiss Lily looked carefully over her ground; Harry Gaynor was gay and\r\ndelightful, but one couldn't be quite sure he was not flirting. And\r\nthough Mr. Weir had plenty of money, there was a large family of\r\nbrothers and sisters, and they lived on an extensive plantation miles\r\naway from any considerable town. There was a Mr. Lewis, not so young,\r\nwho had an interest in an old well-established leather firm that had\r\nbeen left him by an uncle. There were some non-eligibles.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nicoll had said, in her caustic way:--\r\n\r\n\"You make the most of your time, Lily Ludlow. I'm past eighty, and you\r\nmay find me dead in my bed some morning. I have not a stiver to leave\r\nany one; so don't you count on that. I can hardly pay my own way.\"\r\n\r\nStill she had every luxury for herself; for years she had considered\r\nnothing but her own wants and indulgences.\r\n\r\nPoor Jim! In his young mannishness he was quite sure there was no danger\r\nof falling in love; of course such a thing would be wildest folly. But\r\nLily was very fascinating and very flattering. She put it on the score\r\nof old friendship; but, with a coquette's ardour, she did enjoy the\r\nyoung fellow's struggles to keep himself on a firm footing. And when he\r\nsaw Gaynor's attentions, and listened to Weir's rhapsodies, a passion of\r\nboyish jealousy sprang up in his heart.\r\n\r\nMiss Lily kept her other admirers out of the way, except as she might\r\nmeet them at dances or whist parties. She was not much in love with Mr.\r\nLewis; he was slow and really conceited, and, for a young man, rather\r\ncareful of his money. If she only dared run the risk, and take Mr. Weir,\r\nwho was to finish his college course in the summer! And then arose a new\r\nstar on her horizon.\r\n\r\nMr. Williamson was forty and a widower; but he drove an elegant pair of\r\nbays, belonged to a club, and had apartments at a hotel. She tried\r\ncaptivating simplicity, and succeeded, to her great surprise, though she\r\nknew his habits were not irreproachable. She had begged of Mr. Lewis a\r\nlittle time for consideration, when one morning Mr. Williamson\r\nastonished her by a call, and an offer of his hand and fortune.\r\n\r\nMiss Ludlow did not show her amazement, neither did she jump at the\r\noffer. She was very delicately surprised. Was he quite certain of his\r\nwishes? And--it was so unexpected!\r\n\r\nSo certain indeed that he would bring her a ring that very afternoon,\r\nand take her out driving,--a man of his years not to know his own mind!\r\n\r\nShe could hardly believe her good fortune. For a fortnight she\r\nengineered her way skilfully, still keeping Mr. Lewis in reserve. And\r\nthen she was convinced, and dismissed him.\r\n\r\n\"Guess who is engaged?\" Harry Gaynor cried, one morning. \"I never was so\r\nbeat in my life! Jim, maybe this will hit you hard. Seems to me you've\r\nbeen rather distraught of late and sighing like a furnace.\"\r\n\r\n\"These exams are enough to make any one sigh. And I am way behind. I\r\nmust study day and night.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are always engagements at this season, and weddings at Easter,\"\r\nreturned Weir, laughingly.\r\n\r\n\"That isn't guessing, Jim!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bother! What do I care?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your charmer told you last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"My charmer? What are you driving at, Gaynor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how innocent! Miss Lily Ludlow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've met that Lewis there,\" returned Jim, with an air of bravado,\r\nthough he flushed a little. \"He's a regular stick.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it isn't Lewis. It's that Gerald Williamson,--a man about town. And\r\nthe queer thing is that he thinks he has struck a fortune. Do _you_\r\nknow, Jim? Is she to be the old lady's heir?\"\r\n\r\nJim was silent. What should he say?\r\n\r\n\"Of course she is,\" said Weir. \"That is--I think it depends on whether\r\nMrs. Nicoll approves of the marriage.\"\r\n\r\nHe had turned very pale.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure it is Williamson?\" asked Jim.\r\n\r\n\"He announced it himself. My cousin heard him. And as for the old\r\nlady--the house is willed away. I've heard some talk; I can't just\r\nremember what. She's been shrewdly giving the impression.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a shame to sell her to the highest bidder! And Williamson's\r\ndouble her age. No sister of mine would be allowed to do such a thing.\r\nShe can't love him! Why, she has only been driving out with him a few\r\ntimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she's sold, she has done the business herself. She's a girl to look\r\nout for the main chance. Weir, I hope you haven't been hovering too near\r\nthe flame. The Ludlow is capital to flirt with,--quick, spicy,\r\nsentimental by spells, not the kind of a girl to waste herself on a\r\nyoung, impecunious fellow like our friend Jim, here, so he goes\r\nscot-free. Weir, I hope you're not hard hit. We've all had a good time;\r\nbut I think now we must address ourselves to the examinations in hand,\r\nand let the girls go. Though I am in for two big weddings, presently.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a summons to the class-room that stopped the chaffing. Jim\r\nfelt very sober. Lily had indirectly led him to think she cared a great\r\ndeal about him, and if matters only _were_ a little different! He ought\r\nnot to get engaged; but the preference was flattering when a man like\r\nWeir was head over heels in love with her!\r\n\r\nBut to marry an old man like Gerald Williamson! thought the young\r\nfellow, disdainfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCOUNTING UP THE COST\r\n\r\n\r\nJim failed miserably. What was the matter? He couldn't seem to remember\r\nthe simplest thing. Did it make any difference to him whom she married?\r\nWell--if it _had_ been Weir; but that imperious, pretentious,\r\nhalf-dissipated Williamson, who report said had run though with one\r\nfortune, and two years ago had fallen heir to another! Why were some\r\npeople so lucky! Grandmother Van Kortlandt had some money; but Hanny was\r\nnamed for her, and Joe was a great favourite. Then Jim flushed hotly.\r\nThe idea of counting on any one's money!\r\n\r\nStill he had a boyish, chivalric idea that he would like to snatch Lily\r\nfrom this awful peril, as it seemed to him. Could it be really true? The\r\nolder men said Williamson was a braggart. There might be no truth in it.\r\nHe would ask Lily.\r\n\r\nSeveral days passed before Jim achieved his desire. Then, as he loitered\r\naround one afternoon, he saw Williamson leave the house. After a few\r\nmoments he knocked.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Lily is indisposed, and cannot see any one,\" announced the maid.\r\n\r\n\"She will see me,\" returned Jim, with an air of dignity; and he walked\r\ninto the parlour that had an atmosphere of twilight, quite determined to\r\nremain until she came down.\r\n\r\nShe seemed in no hurry, and Jim's temper began to loose its serenity.\r\nThe maid came and lighted the gas jet in the hall. Then there was a\r\nrustle of silken garments on the stair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jim dear,\" the entreating voice said, \"I've had such a horrid\r\nheadache all the afternoon. I've been in the bed. I really did not feel\r\nfit to see any one,\" with a languid, indifferent air.\r\n\r\nAnd Williamson had just gone away!\r\n\r\n\"So you will excuse me, if I'm stupid--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the story true about your--your engagement?\" asked the young fellow,\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"My engagement? Well, I've had an offer of marriage,--two of them.\r\nWouldn't you advise me to take the best one?\" rather archly.\r\n\r\nThe tone rang flippantly. Jim felt she was evading.\r\n\r\n\"You see I can't be young always. And Aunt Nicoll may go without a\r\nmoment's warning. She had a bad spell yesterday; and she does get in\r\nsuch horrid tantrums! Mother is awfully tired of staying with her. And\r\nmost girls get married--those who have a chance.\" She ended with a\r\nforced little laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Is it Williamson? You don't know the sort of man he is,\" and Jim's\r\nvoice was husky with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, everybody gets talked about sooner or later! He has been rather\r\nwild; but he wants to settle down now. And I'm not a sentimental girl.\r\nYes, I do think I'll take him,\" hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n\"Lily!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jim, you are very young and inexperienced! If you were ten years\r\nolder, there wouldn't be a man on the whole earth I'd marry as soon. But\r\nyou know I said we could only be friends; and I hope you haven't been\r\ncherishing any silly romances about me,\" tossing her head coquettishly.\r\n\"I shall always like you, and I want us to keep friends. But you can't\r\nunderstand all the reasons. Some girls might drag you into an\r\nengagement, and waste all your young years; but I could not be so mean\r\nto any friend I cared about. We have settled all this matter.\"\r\n\r\nHer tone took on a rather sharp business accent. It was almost curt.\r\n\r\nYes, it had been settled. Yet she had demanded a lover-like devotion,\r\nand allowed him to speculate on what might have been if she were rich or\r\nhe older. And though Jim's sturdy common-sense had kept him from going\r\nvery deep, he felt wretched and jealous that any other man should have\r\nthe supreme right; and yet he had a conviction that the friendship or\r\nflirtation ought to end.\r\n\r\n\"He thinks you are Mrs. Nicoll's heiress.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a light laugh. \"Oh, that will do to talk about; and she may\r\nleave me a little. If I was her heiress--\"\r\n\r\nThe glance roused Jim's anger. He rose suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you love Williamson,\" he said, in a tone that he meant to sound\r\nbitterly cutting. \"A girl who sells herself for money to such a man--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, Jim!\" She rose also. \"You'll find most of the world will\r\nconsider it a good marriage; and anyhow, I have to look out for myself.\r\nIt's too bad to break up the pleasant times we've had this winter; but\r\nyou must not be angry. You will understand it better presently. I\r\nwouldn't let you go off in this way if I hadn't such a wretched\r\nheadache; but you will come in again.\"\r\n\r\nJim said good-evening with superb dignity. What a stylish fellow he was.\r\nOf course he felt a little \"huffy\" now; but next winter, when she had a\r\nhome of her own, she would give attractive parties, and invite Jim among\r\nthe very first. By that time he would be over his boyish folly. And now,\r\nwhat must she wear to the theatre to-night? She must look her prettiest.\r\nHer wretched headache was gone.\r\n\r\nJames Underhill felt as he had sometimes in the old school days, that he\r\nhad been duped. He was angry with her, with himself. He had brought his\r\nfriends to the house; and he knew Weir was really in love with her, yet\r\nshe had laughed daintily about some of his peculiarities. What if she\r\nhad laughed with Gaynor about him? She did satirise people. It was\r\nstrange how many faults he saw in her! Yet he did hate to have her\r\nmarry Williamson.\r\n\r\nHe heard of her being at the theatre that evening with an array of\r\ndiamonds, which young girls seldom wore. In a week or so the marriage\r\nwas discussed with a little wonder. Mrs. Nicoll was one of the old New\r\nYorkers, a Ludlow herself. It was fortunate for Lily's prestige that her\r\nplain, unambitious father was dead, and her mother kept well in the\r\nbackground. No one quite knew about the fortune.\r\n\r\nRichard Weir was certainly hard hit. He made a pretence of devoting\r\nhimself to his studies to keep away from Gaynor's raillery. But one day\r\nhe said to Jim,--\r\n\r\n\"Something ought to be done to save Miss Ludlow from such an awful\r\nsacrifice; don't you think so, Underhill? That old aunt has egged her\r\non, and she's doing this for her mother's sake. If I was in a position\r\nto marry, I know I could persuade her to throw it up. What shall I do,\r\nJim? I know she really loves me. She is heroic about it. She thinks it\r\nwould spoil my life in the very beginning. I don't know how father would\r\ntake it; and there's such a family of us to provide for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her alone,\" returned Jim, gruffly. So she had played with this\r\nhonest-hearted young fellow as well; and the saddest of all was that he\r\nreally believed in her.\r\n\r\n\"She will marry Williamson, no matter what comes. Weir, I'm sorry enough\r\nI introduced you, if you are going to take it that way. Lily Ludlow is\r\na flirt, pure and simple. I've never believed it until now. There is no\r\nuse in our wasting our sympathies upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't half do her justice, Jim; if you could hear her side--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard it,\" laconically. \"Weir, I'm awful sorry,\" and he wrung\r\nthe young fellow's hand.\r\n\r\nThere was another aspect to Jim beside the mortification. He had dropped\r\nbehind in his standing. Late hours and planning all sorts of amusements\r\nhad distracted his attention. And there was another fact to face. He had\r\nbeen spending money with a lavishness that he wondered at now. He had\r\nborrowed of Weir, of Gaynor, of Ben. When he counted up the total he was\r\ndismayed. His father had been generous. They had all been very proud of\r\nhim. How could he confess the miserable fiasco to any one? Perhaps,\r\nafter he had taken his degree--\r\n\r\nBut he had to study hard for that. No more frolicking about! He had a\r\ngood deal of resolution, when it was put to the test. He would ask\r\nsober-going Ben to lend him a hundred dollars, which he would pay back\r\nby degrees. No girl should ever win a smile out of him again. He would\r\nnever borrow when he was once out of this difficulty.\r\n\r\nHe knew Dick Weir really needed his money, and this emboldened him to\r\napply to Ben. Alas!\r\n\r\n\"I'd do it in a minute Jim; but I've been trying a sort of experiment.\r\nI had a chance to buy some capital stock, five hundred dollars' worth,\r\nand I just scraped up everything I had, and borrowed, so I'm behind, and\r\nmust catch up. You've been pretty gay, haven't you, Jim?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been an idiot,\" replied Jim, sturdily. \"But I have learned a\r\nlesson.\"\r\n\r\n\"You just go to Joe. He's the best fellow in all the world. Don't worry\r\nfather about it; he takes such pride in his young collegian,\" and Ben\r\nsmiled with generous kindliness upon his younger brother.\r\n\r\nThat was the best thing certainly; yet it was days before Jim could\r\nsummon sufficient courage. And then he found, as he blundered a little\r\nover the matter, that Joe thought it worse than it really was.\r\n\r\n\"Have you been gambling?\" the elder asked gravely.\r\n\r\n\"No, not that, Joe. It's all been a silly sort of extravagance. I am mad\r\nat myself when I think of it.\" He wouldn't say he had been tempted by a\r\ngirl into much unwise expenditure. How could he have been so weak!\r\n\r\n\"It will be all right,\" returned Joe. \"I am glad it is not gambling\r\ndebts; though a hundred dollars wouldn't cover much. I hope you are\r\ncoming through in good shape.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure of that. Oh, Joe, how kind you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is brotherhood for, if not that?\" said Joe gravely.\r\n\r\nHe would not put himself in the way of meeting Miss Ludlow, though she\r\ndid send him two rather plaintive notes. Early in June, the marriage\r\ntook place; and the bride's trousseau was quite magnificent, if it was\r\nnot made in Paris. Mrs. Nicoll was delighted with what she termed her\r\ngrandniece's good sense, and gave her a handsome set of rubies, beside\r\nhaving her diamonds reset for her. And when she died, some two months\r\nlater, it was found she had made a new will on Lily's wedding day, in\r\nwhich she bequeathed the bride all her personal effects and some\r\nvaluable bank-stock, if the amount was not very large. The next winter,\r\nMrs. Williamson took her place in society, and was quite a married\r\nbelle, managing her husband as adroitly as she had managed her lovers.\r\n\r\nJim studied day and almost night to make up for the dissipation of the\r\nwinter, and passed with honour, though Joe had hoped he would have one\r\nof the orations. He went immediately into the law office of a friend of\r\nStephen's as clerk and copyist while he was waiting for the new term of\r\nthe law school.\r\n\r\nCharles Reed did distinguish himself, and was one of the heroes of the\r\noccasion. He was a fine, manly fellow now, and Mrs. Dean loved him like\r\na son. Indeed, it seemed as if he might be her son, the young people\r\nwere so much to each other. Josie would graduate the next year at the\r\nhigh school.\r\n\r\nBen and Delia had gone along through the winter with very little\r\nchange, except to learn how much they loved each other. The young men\r\ndid not have quite such rollicking good times, though Nora was\r\ndeveloping into a very attractive young girl and enchanted them with her\r\nsinging. Delia was very busy trying her best to come up to some high\r\nstandards of literary work. Everybody was not a genius in those days.\r\nColleges had not begun to turn them out by the score, and the elder\r\npeople were very often helpful to the younger ones.\r\n\r\nThere was, it is true, a certain kind of Bohemianism among the men that\r\nproved dangerous to more than one fine, promising mind. Ben liked the\r\nbright wit and keen encounters, and the talk that ran through centuries\r\nof intellectual activity as if it was only yesterday. He was taking a\r\ncurious interest in politics as well, for some great questions were\r\ncoming to the fore.\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill had preserved a cautious silence respecting Delia,\r\nindeed, ignored the whole matter. Dolly was cordial when they met. Jim\r\nhad been so taken up with his engrossing experience that he rarely went\r\nto Beach Street; and the two sets of society were widely apart. Delia\r\nhad supposed everything would come around straight; it generally did in\r\nher happy-go-lucky fashion.\r\n\r\nBut on Commencement day, when she was all smiles and gladness, Mrs.\r\nUnderhill's coolness and Mrs. Hoffman's stately distance quite amazed\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Ben,\" she said, \"something has happened with your people. Your mother\r\nhardly spoke to me, and Margaret was icy. And now that I come to think\r\nof it, Hanny hasn't been near us since Nora's birthday--February that\r\nwas. Are they offended because--don't they like our engagement? And I\r\nlove them all so, from least to greatest; only Margaret is rather high\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanny's had such lots of lessons, and her music, and she's\r\ncorresponding with Daisy Jasper in French. Grandmother takes her time,\r\ntoo. You don't have so much leisure out of childhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"What jolly times we had back there in First Street! Oh, Ben, I did like\r\nyou all so much! And I can't bear to have the good feeling die out.\"\r\n\r\nThere were tears in Delia's brown eyes. Ben was moved immeasurably.\r\n\r\n\"May be I ought to have said something to mother; Joe counselled me to\r\nwait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it has been talked about!\" Delia stood up very straight, and\r\nlooked like a spirited picture. \"What is their objection to me? Your\r\nfamily are all prospering. Stephen is really a man of mark; Of course\r\nDr. Hoffman was rich to begin with. And John's wife had quite a fortune\r\nwhen her parents died. Joe is up among the important people; and Jim\r\nwill make a smart lawyer, every one says. You _are_ a splendid lot!\" and\r\nher honest admiration touched him.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I've never felt very splendid.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are solid, and strong, and sensible. What a pity that alliteration\r\nwon't do in a poem!\" and she laughed in her joyous manner. \"I don't\r\ncare if you never are rich, so long as we have good times. And as you\r\ncan't write a bit of verse, you dear, lovely old Ben, nor a story, I do\r\nnot believe our tastes will clash. Why shouldn't we agree just as well\r\nwhen we are married as we do now? Even that tremendous, gloomy, erratic\r\nEdgar Allan Poe adored not only his wife, but his mother-in-law. To be\r\nsure, there was Milton and Byron, and Mrs. Hemans and Bulwer, and a host\r\nof them; but Mr. and Mrs. Browning are going on serenely. And 'The\r\nScarlet Letter' hasn't made trouble in Hawthorne's family yet. I think\r\nit is temper, rather than genius. And I have a good temper, Ben,\"\r\nlooking up out of honest, convincing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You just have,\" returned Ben, with emphasis, kissing her fondly.\r\n\r\n\"Ben, I love you too well to make you unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will never make me unhappy.\"\r\n\r\n\"May be I'm not careful enough in little things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't fret about the little things,\" said Ben. \"We both like\r\neasy-chairs, and evenings at home, and reading about famous people, or\r\nqueer people, and wonderful places. We both like a fire, and a cat; I\r\nadore a nice cat, it is such a comfortable thing. And we like to go out\r\nwhere people are bright and vivacious, and know something. We're fond of\r\nmusic, and pictures, and like a good play. Oh, there are things enough\r\nto agree upon all our lives; so what would be the use of hunting round\r\nto find a few things to dispute about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, there wouldn't be. But I want your mother to like me, and to feel\r\nsure I shall do my best to make you happy. Of course, we may not get\r\nrich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bother riches! But I'm not going to give you up for anybody in\r\nChristendom.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very sweet, Ben.\" There was a sound of tears in Delia's voice.\r\n\r\n\"I'll see what it is,\" subjoined Ben. \"Oh, it will all come straight, I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not marry you for the next seven years, no, not for twenty,\r\nuntil everybody is willing,\" said Delia, decisively.\r\n\r\nWhy couldn't people be kindly affectioned one toward another, as the\r\nApostle enjoined, when there was nothing very objectionable in the\r\nother? It puzzled Ben. He was passionately fond of his mother, too; but\r\nthe issue had to be met. And the very next evening when Mrs. Underhill\r\nwas out watering her garden, that had in it all manner of sweet herbs\r\nand the old-time flowers dear to her heart, Ben came wandering down the\r\nclean-cut path.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" when they had both stood silently several minutes,--\"mother, I\r\nwant to tell you--Delia Whitney and I are engaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"I supposed as much,\" said his mother, tartly. Then she turned to come\r\nup the path.\r\n\r\n\"Mother, you have welcomed Dolly and Cleanthe; and we have all been like\r\nbrothers and sisters. Haven't you a tender word for Delia? You used to\r\nlike her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Delia Whitney was well enough for a neighbour. You have run and run\r\nthere, Ben, and really never taken the trouble to look about. You are\r\nyoung, and hardly know what is best for you. You could have looked\r\nhigher. But you've gotten in with those newspaper people; and they do\r\ndrink, and are not very choice in their company.\"\r\n\r\n\"And lawyers drink; yet we are going to make a lawyer out of Jim. And we\r\nhave known country farmers addicted to the habit. Newspaper-men are\r\nquite up to the average. But that has nothing to do with Delia.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, women don't so often take to drinking. But she is in it all; and I\r\ndon't like such public business for a woman. A wife's place is at home;\r\nand Mrs. Whitney is a very poor housekeeper. Ben, a great deal of a\r\nman's happiness depends on the way his house is kept.\"\r\n\r\n\"But their house is always bright and pleasant. And think how Delia used\r\nto work in First Street. She can keep house good enough for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have always had things so neat and orderly, Ben, that you don't\r\nknow how trying that sort of helter-skelter housekeeping can be. A woman\r\ncan't run hither and yon, and write stories and what not; and now they\r\nare beginning to lecture and talk, and make themselves as mannish as\r\npossible! No, I don't like it. And I pity the man who has to live in\r\nthat sort of neglected home. And then, Ben, come disputes and\r\nseparations.\"\r\n\r\nHe had heard the narrow reasoning before. Mrs. Reed came into his mind.\r\nWith her passion for cleanliness and order, she certainly knew nothing\r\nabout a happy, comfortable home. His mother still scouted a\r\nsewing-machine. Delia had hired one with a good operator, and declared\r\nthat in a week they had done up all the summer sewing. He knew his\r\nmother would say it was only half-done. To be sure, Delia's mother was a\r\ngreat novel-reader and had neglected her household many a time for an\r\ninteresting book. But _she_ wrote neither stories nor verses.\r\n\r\n\"Of course, you will do as you like. And you think you are the only one\r\nthat will suffer. But a mother has many sorrowful hours over a son's\r\nunhappiness and discomfort.\"\r\n\r\nThen she passed him, and went into the house. And, after the fashion of\r\nunreasoning women, she hurried up to her own room and cried a few bitter\r\ntears. Ben had been such a good, upright, pleasant son. He ought to have\r\nthe best wife in the world, for he was easy-going and would put up with\r\nalmost anything. She _was_ disappointed.\r\n\r\nShe would have scouted the idea of being aristocratic or mercenary; yet\r\nshe did want him to look higher. There had been such an attractive\r\nHoffman cousin spending a month with Margaret, who thought Ben\r\ndelightful. There were two or three girls in the neighbourhood. In fact,\r\na young man might as well marry some one of distinction and character;\r\nDolly and Cleanthe were none the worse for their money.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what I can do,\" Ben said to Dolly, with a sigh. \"Delia has\r\na suspicion that mother is against her. I'm not in a hurry to marry;\r\nbut Delia won't marry me until everybody is ready to welcome her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you are young; and a good many things come around straight if you\r\ngive them time, just like a northeast wind. Ask Delia to come up to tea,\r\nwhenever she and you are at liberty.\"\r\n\r\nDolly kissed Ben. In some respects he was still boyish.\r\n\r\nMargaret was vexed over the certainty. It was said Nora Whitney had a\r\nchance to go abroad with a Madame Somebody who used to sing in operas.\r\nShe would be educated for a professional. Of course a Jenny Lind or a\r\nParodi or Malibran was different; but just an ordinary singer!--or one\r\ncould admire an acknowledged woman of genius who had a position, or any\r\nsocial prestige!\r\n\r\nBen said nothing to Delia; but she guessed his announcement had not been\r\nsatisfactory. She had not been to the Underhills for six months or more.\r\nBut, in her generous fashion, she made no comment.\r\n\r\nLate that summer a wonderful thing happened that filled everybody with\r\nelation, and for twenty-four hours set the city wild. Every show-window\r\nhad a picture of a trim, spirited yacht that seemed to have triumph\r\nwritten all over her; and men and boys crowded around to look at it, and\r\ncheered it with an enthusiasm seldom inspired nowadays. We were all\r\ngoing wild over our great triumph; for we had distanced England on the\r\nseas and in British waters. The gallant \"America\" had borne off the\r\n\"Queen's Cup,\" the prize offered for the fleetest yacht in the great\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nWe had been very proud of our fleet \"clippers\" that were scudding about\r\nto different ports. Then the Steers brothers had built the \"America\" for\r\nMr. Stevens, of the New York Yacht Club; and he decided to take her over\r\nto the great contest that was to be a race around the Isle of Wight. She\r\nmet with a little mishap in the beginning; but, nothing daunted, her\r\ncourageous captain kept on to the end, eighty-one miles, and distanced\r\nall competitors. Other yachts of all nations were entered; and it must\r\nhave been a magnificent sight when she had eight minutes to spare, and\r\ncould glance back at her really splendid rivals. The pretty story of\r\nQueen Victoria and the Prince Consort was told over many times. The\r\nQueen asked the captain of the royal yacht who was first.\r\n\r\n\"The 'America,' your Majesty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is second?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no second, your Majesty,\" returned the Captain, gallantly\r\nadmitting the defeat.\r\n\r\nSo the brave \"America,\" after being flattered and fêted, brought home\r\nher trophy; and thousands rushed to see that and the beautiful yacht.\r\nBut the English Club did not mean to resign honours so easily, and\r\nannounced that efforts would be made to win back the famous cup. And\r\nto-day the cup is still ours, after many challenges and trials.\r\n\r\nBut the enthusiasm then knew no bounds. There were little flags with a\r\nminiature yacht and the American colours; and the patriotic boys wore\r\nthem in their jackets. Jim put up a handsome engraving in his room.\r\n\r\nHe had been working like a Trojan all summer, except a brief fortnight,\r\nand had begun to pay back his debt.\r\n\r\nNora Whitney was to go abroad under the care of a well-known musician\r\nand his wife, who was a fine concert-singer. It seemed such an excellent\r\nopportunity; and Nora had an ambition to reach a high standard. The\r\nProfessor and Madame had visited the Whitneys, and both parties were\r\nmutually satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"I could never let a child of mine go away among strangers in that\r\nmanner,\" declared Mrs. Underhill. \"No one can tell what will happen to\r\nher. I shouldn't have thought it of Mr. Theodore. The women, of course,\r\nare not overweighted with common sense, and the poor child has no\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear,\" sighed Hanny, \"all the little girls are dropping out; and we\r\nused to have such nice times. I do wonder if Daisy means ever to come\r\nback. And Josie Dean is a young lady with long dresses, and does up her\r\nhair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elenora Whitney is not worth worrying about,\" subjoined Mrs. Underhill,\r\ntartly; \"and Josie Dean is a very nice, modest girl.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Reed and Josie had dropped into a fashion of making frequent\r\ncalls during the summer. The young fellow made a confidant of Doctor\r\nJoe, as young people were very apt to do, he was so sympathetic and\r\nkindly.\r\n\r\nMr. Reed had quite a fancy at first that he should study medicine.\r\n\r\n\"It is a fine profession, when one's heart is in it,\" said Doctor Joe.\r\n\"And there are so many new discoveries and methods all the time. Still,\r\nI can't quite fancy Charlie taking up the disagreeable side.\"\r\n\r\n\"He could be a professor, I suppose,\" commented his father, rather\r\nreluctantly. \"He loves study and books, and he ought to turn his\r\neducation to some account. I would do anything for him; he knows that.\r\nHe is all I have; and he is a fine boy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was odd; but Charlie talked his desire over with Josie first of all,\r\nand she approved of it enthusiastically. Then he rather timidly\r\nconfessed it to his father.\r\n\r\n\"I used to believe that I never wanted to be a clergyman; but, after\r\nmother died, I began to think it over. She was so sort of sweet and\r\nchanged that last year, almost as if she had a presentiment; and though\r\nshe took such an interest in my studies, she never spoke of that, though\r\nI know it was her heart's desire. All the time I seem to have had a\r\nleaning towards it. It is a grand life, when one's heart and soul are in\r\nit; and I am sure now mine would be. I should feel as if I was keeping\r\nnear to her, and doing something for her happiness. And if you would not\r\nfeel disappointed--\"\r\n\r\n\"My boy, I should be gratified,\" said his father, warmly. \"I should not\r\nhave tried to influence your choice; but I do think, in certain ways,\r\nyou are especially fitted for this profession. I can trust you never to\r\nbring discredit on so sacred a calling; and I think you are alive to\r\nthe true responsibility of it. Yes; it is what she would like, if she\r\nwere here.\"\r\n\r\nJim declared he had felt sure of this decision all the last year. They\r\nall decided Charles Reed would make a fine conscientious clergyman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA GLAD SURPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe stood at the doorway of the Institute. It was still in\r\nMadison Street, though it was to go up-town and be transformed into a\r\ncollege. The girls came trooping out,--they were really girls then, and\r\nhad a deliciously girlish air.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Joe!\" cried Hanny, glancing up rather in amaze. What had happened?\r\n\r\nHe bowed gravely to some of her compeers. They thought Jim splendid; but\r\nthey stood a little in awe of grave Doctor Joe.\r\n\r\n\"I have come for you to go and make a call,\" he said. \"Let me take your\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced up the street.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this isn't in style,\" he began laughingly. \"I have neither coach\r\nnor four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will have a nice walk. Where? Down at the Battery?\"\r\n\r\nShe had such a sweet, eager face, and she was so easily pleased.\r\n\r\n\"We will go over to Broadway, first,\" he replied. \"Then--well, wherever\r\nyou like.\"\r\n\r\nSo they chatted as they walked along, across City Hall Square, where the\r\nfountain was still playing on sunny days.\r\n\r\nThe Astor House was yet in its glory. She wondered a little, as they\r\nwalked up the stone steps, through the hall, and then up the thickly\r\npadded stairs, and into the spacious parlour.\r\n\r\nA lady, dressed in black, was standing by the window, and turned\r\nsmilingly. Hanny was bewildered by a familiar likeness. Then a young\r\ngirl sprang up from the sofa; and Hanny caught a glint of golden curls,\r\nas she was clasped in the outstretched arms.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hanny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Daisy!\"\r\n\r\nThat was all they said for a moment or two. They cried a little, as\r\npeople often do, out of pure gladness, and just hugged each other\r\ntighter.\r\n\r\n\"I was so afraid I never should see you again. Papa laughed. You know he\r\nhas crossed the ocean so many times. If I hadn't been coming home, I\r\nsuppose I shouldn't have been worried. But it seemed such a long, long\r\nwhile, and I was just crazy to see you, to get home. I don't believe I\r\nshall ever really want to go abroad again.\"\r\n\r\nHanny raised her head from Daisy Jasper's shoulder. Oh, what a tall girl\r\nshe was! Her complexion was like pearl and blush roses; her hair was a\r\nwonderful gold; and her eyes, somehow, suggested the starry heaven at\r\nnight. Hanny felt strangely abashed.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Jasper claimed a greeting. Hanny knew that a year ago they had\r\nlost Aunt Ellen, with an attack of fever. Mrs. Jasper looked rather\r\npale, but she had not changed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you haven't grown a bit!\" cried Daisy. \"And look at me! You'll\r\nhave to go to German baths, and all that, to get a good start. What a\r\npity you did not go with us! I've had such a longing for girls. You\r\ndon't get acquainted with them on the continent. They are always in the\r\nschool-room. And I am just hungry, all the way through, for some one\r\nyoung and enthusiastic, and foolish and merry things to laugh at.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--I didn't know you were coming--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear Doctor Joe kept the secret well. We did hope to be in on\r\nSaturday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then _you_ knew?\" and she looked half reproachfully at her brother.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. He had only done Daisy's bidding.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if you want to keep Hanny to dinner, I'll come down this evening.\r\nI have a few calls to make,\" he announced presently.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed we do. You have so many folks, you might give me Hanny,\" and\r\nDaisy glanced at Doctor Joe with a bright, arch smile.\r\n\r\n\"If you took Hanny, you would have to take father and me, sure. The\r\nothers might squeeze along without her; but I am afraid they would get\r\nthin on it.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Doctor nodded and went his way.\r\n\r\n\"Now that you have Hanny, I will go and unpack one of the trunks,\" said\r\nMrs. Jasper.\r\n\r\nHanny and Daisy went down in the corner of the long apartment, and took\r\npossession of a _tête-à-tête_.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are so changed!\" cried the little girl \"And so--so beautiful!\"\r\n\r\n\"And so well! That's the loveliest thing. I can take long walks and\r\ndance, think of that! I am only a little lame. Just the merest crook in\r\nmy back, and one leg a tiny bit shorter, but a thick sole makes it all\r\nright. And I've grown like a weed, while you are a tiny bit of something\r\nvery choice,--a dainty little white rose. And I am so glad to have you\r\nagain. Oh, don't let anything ever come between us! Let us be friends\r\nall our lives long. I have brought you a beautiful ring to bind\r\nfriendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" sighed Hanny, in delight.\r\n\r\n\"And there have been so many changes! Oh, who do you think we met in\r\nLondon? Not Whittington and his cat, but Nora Whitney without her cat.\r\nAnd poor Pussy Gray is dead, and Nora is a tall young lady with a\r\nsplendid voice, and will make a famous singer, I suppose. And Delia is\r\ngetting to be famous too, I hear. It is odd, but she doesn't suggest a\r\ngenius to my mind. I think you often are disappointed in geniuses. We\r\nsaw some while abroad, and they did not come up to my expectations, or\r\nelse one expects too much. Still there are some lovely faces.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she is just delightful! Only she keeps so busy, we do not see much\r\nof her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And poor little Tudie! How sad it was! I can sympathise with her sister\r\nnow, for being an only child.\"\r\n\r\nThen Hanny said Charlie had entered a theological seminary; and Daisy\r\nagreed being a clergyman would prove just the calling for him, he was so\r\nearnest and conscientious. Hanny had written everything, she thought;\r\nbut Daisy was so eager to hear it all over again.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper came in. He had been back and forth, and kept up the habit of\r\ncalling on the Underhills, so nothing about Hanny surprised him.\r\n\r\nThe little girl felt rather startled when she went into the large\r\ndining-room. At this period, there were people who spent the whole\r\nseason at the Astor House, though there were some newer hotels that were\r\nvery attractive. It was like a grand party, Hanny thought. The ladies\r\nwere so prettily attired, so bright and chatty.\r\n\r\nWhen they went back to the parlour, that looked like a party, too. Hanny\r\nfelt very plain in her school-dress. There were a number of Mr. Jasper's\r\nbusiness friends, that he brought up to introduce to his wife and the\r\ntwo girls. But they were so busy talking, that they hardly noticed any\r\none else.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe returned, armed with an invitation from Mrs. Underhill, for\r\nMrs. Jasper and Daisy, to come up and make them a visit; and Mrs. Jasper\r\nsaid she should be glad to go somewhere, and find an old-fashioned\r\nAmerican home-feeling. Daisy could hardly let Hanny go. Doctor Joe\r\nproposed that he should come for Daisy the next day, for she could not\r\nbe of any special service to her mother until some plans were decided\r\nupon. That was a splendid thought.\r\n\r\nThey kissed and kissed, as if they were never to see each other again.\r\nHanny's eyes were lustrous, and her cheeks pink with excitement. And\r\nthere was so much to tell her mother.\r\n\r\n\"You must go to bed,\" declared Doctor Joe. \"It is after ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, oh, my lessons! I have not looked at them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind lessons now. You can get up early in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nShe was very tired, she had talked so much and listened so intently. And\r\nin five minutes she was asleep, in spite of the unlearned lessons.\r\n\r\nShe studied every moment the next morning, and all the way down in the\r\nstage, and managed to get through. She was a very good scholar\r\nordinarily, and ambitious to have perfect recitations. But she kept\r\ncounting the hours, for she could hardly believe Daisy Jasper was really\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nJoe brought her up to the house when he had finished his round of calls.\r\nHe handed her out quite as if she was a stylish young lady, though she\r\nwas not in long gowns. But Joe was curiously proud of her, as being one\r\nof his first cases.\r\n\r\nEverybody gave her a cordial welcome. Jim was at once her most devoted.\r\nMrs. Underhill soon concluded foreign ways had not spoiled her; and\r\ngrandmother said she was a pretty-behaved, intelligent girl. But, oh,\r\nthe things she had seen, and done! She could talk French and German; she\r\nhad taken painting-lessons from real artists, and had some pretty\r\nstudies for Hanny, in a box not yet unpacked. She had brought the\r\nfriendship ring, which was two tiny hands clasped over a sapphire with\r\ndiamond sparks around it. Hanny's eyes shone with delight; she was\r\ngetting quite a collection in the way of gifts.\r\n\r\nDaisy seemed to bring a fascinating atmosphere. She was not forward,\r\nindeed there was often a pretty air of deprecation; but she had seen a\r\ngood deal of society without being actually in it, and, since her aunt's\r\ndeath, had been her mother's companion. Her different lessons had mostly\r\nbeen given at home, except those in oil-painting; and there was no air\r\nof schools about her. She was so ready to be entertaining, so fresh, and\r\nyet with a charming simplicity.\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad for Hanny to have such a friend,\" her mother said to the\r\nDoctor. \"She hasn't seemed to take any one to her heart since we have\r\nbeen up here; and it does make her seem a bit old-fashioned to be so\r\nmuch with elderly people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They seem to suit exactly.\"\r\n\r\nJim took them over to the Deans' one evening. Oh, what a merry talk they\r\nhad about old times, for it did seem quite old to them. They recalled\r\nthe day in summer, when the \"caravan\" went down Broadway to the store\r\nwhere Charles had been employed one vacation, and dear old First Street.\r\nBiddy Brady, who had danced for them, had run away and married a young\r\nIrishman. Old Mrs. McGiven still sold candies and cakes, and\r\nslate-pencils, and, oh, Washington pie that was almost as great a\r\nnecessity to childhood then, as chewing-gum is now.\r\n\r\nMr. Jasper brought up the pictures when he escorted his wife. There were\r\ntwo pretty bits of landscape on the shore of Lake Geneva, and the other\r\na Holland scene, with a stretch of canal and a queer house that looked\r\nas if it might topple over some day, if the foundation was washed out.\r\n\r\n\"But they never do,\" explained Daisy. \"It's all so curious, and most of\r\nit so clean! And, oh, the windmills, and the queer costumes that have\r\nnot changed in a century!\"\r\n\r\nBeside that there was a water-colour, a study of the most elegant\r\ntulips, painted from a real bed.\r\n\r\nHanny was wild with delight. They hung the pictures in her room, though\r\nDoctor Joe declared they ought to go in his study. He pretended to feel\r\nvery badly that Daisy had not done anything for him.\r\n\r\n\"I will wait until I can paint something really worthy,\" she replied\r\nwith a bright flush. \"I owe you so much, that I ought to give you the\r\nvery best. I mean to go on with my lessons. I love the work, and if I\r\nhave any talent, it certainly is that.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you used to draw figures, faces,\" said Hanny, \"and they were so\r\nreal.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the summer I took lessons in miniature painting on ivory. I must\r\nconfess that is my ambition; but it will take years to attain to\r\nperfection. I suppose now I ought to go to studying solid branches,\" and\r\nshe laughed lightly. \"I've begun wrong end first, with the\r\naccomplishments. But I had to talk German, for mamma wouldn't bother.\r\nAnd as she had not forgotten all her French, she went at that with me,\r\nand so I am a tolerable scholar. But I dare say Hanny could twist me all\r\nup with mathematics. I only know enough to count change. Still, I am\r\nquite an expert in foreign money. And, Hanny, were my sentences\r\nfearfully and wonderfully constructed, and did I slip up often on\r\nspelling?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am quite sure you did not,\" protested Hanny.\r\n\r\n\"I do suppose she ought to go to a good school,\" said Mrs. Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid I should not like school now. I could no longer be the\r\nheroine. And how could I descend to an ordinary station in life? Oh, Dr.\r\nUnderhill, can't you interpose on the score of my still delicate\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\nShe had such a pretty colour in her cheeks, and her eyes shone with\r\nmerriment.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, you really must begin to be severe with her. She has her own\r\nway quite too much.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was a very charming way, they all thought. She roused Hanny to an\r\nunwonted brightness. Even grandmother laid claim to her, for she was\r\ndelighted with her piquant description of places and people. She had\r\nheard Jenny Lind, and several other noted singers; but it seemed to her\r\nthat the ovation to the Swedish Nightingale in New York must have been\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nJim claimed her when he was indoors; and they had many a merry bout. It\r\nhardly seemed possible that the few years could have wrought such a\r\nchange in her. Ben took glowing accounts to Delia; and although she felt\r\nhurt and sore over the coolness of the Underhills, she did not abate one\r\njot of her love for Ben.\r\n\r\nShe had been very busy arranging Nora's wardrobe, and now most of the\r\ncare of the house devolved upon her. Mrs. Whitney would read for hours\r\nto Aunt Patty; often the old lady went soundly asleep. To be sure,\r\nmatters were not attended to with the niceness of Mrs. Underhill; but\r\nBarbara was a treasure with her German neatness, and Bridget kept her\r\nkitchen at sixes and sevens. Mr. Theodore brought home one guest or\r\nthree, with the same indifference; and if Ben's mother could have seen\r\nthe cheerful manner in which Delia hurried about and arranged the table\r\non short notice, she must have modified her opinion a little. Theodore\r\nwas quite negligent about money-matters as well. Sometimes he was very\r\nlavish; then he would declare he was \"dead broke,\" and she must do the\r\nbest she could. Three or four of his friends would be in about ten, and\r\ncouldn't she fix up a bit of something?\r\n\r\nSometimes she ran a little in debt; but when the good times came, she\r\nwas only too eager to get matters straight. And she was so bright and\r\ngay with it all, and made Ben's visits so pleasant, that he sometimes\r\nforgot there was any trouble.\r\n\r\nShe had said decisively that they could not marry yet awhile; and Ben\r\nhad accepted her fiat. But they did begin to plan for the journey\r\nabroad, and had a good deal of entertainment counting the cost, and\r\nconsidering where they would go.\r\n\r\n\"I should so like to see Daisy Jasper,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I will ask her to come down,\" answered Ben.\r\n\r\nBut Dolly invited them both up one Saturday, when Hanny and Daisy were\r\nto be there to tea. And Daisy told Delia about meeting Nora, and how\r\nhappy she was in her new prospects.\r\n\r\nShe had been a little homesick, she wrote to Delia, but only for a few\r\nhours at a time. Madame Clavier was as careful as any mother could be,\r\nfussy, she thought sometimes; but no doubt it was for her good.\r\n\r\nDaisy was very attractive to the children until Delia came, when they\r\ndeserted their new friend for stories. Delia had not lost her girlish\r\ngift.\r\n\r\nThe Jaspers were a month making up their minds what to do, and then\r\ndecided to board until spring at least. Joe found them a very pleasant\r\nplace in their neighbourhood, to Hanny's delight. She was so glad to get\r\nher dear friend back again, sweet and unchanged; not but what she had\r\nfound several charming girls at school, and some of them were just wild\r\nto see that lovely Miss Jasper, so her circle was widening all the time.\r\n\r\nMargaret thought she ought to wear long dresses. Girls not quite grown\r\nup wore them to their gaiter-tops. Crisp, elegant button-boots had not\r\ncome in, like a good many other excellent things. And Hanny was\r\nundeniably petite. Stretch up her very utmost, she hardly measured five\r\nfeet. Women had not, by taking thought, added an inch to their stature\r\nby high heels. There were one or two \"lifts\" put in between the soles,\r\ncalled spring-heels; but the hats helped out a little.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't grown an inch this year,\" she declared ruefully. \"And I am\r\nafraid I never will be any taller. It's queer, when all the rest of you\r\nare large.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are just right,\" said her father. \"You will be my little girl all\r\nyour life long.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe comforted her with the asseveration that he liked little\r\nwomen, \"honest and true;\" and Daisy also insisted she was just right.\r\n\r\n\"For you see how admirably your head goes down on my shoulder; and if we\r\nwere the same size, we should be bumping heads. Queen Victoria is only\r\nfive feet, and she is very queenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not queenly.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you could be, if you set about it.\"\r\n\r\nShe had some frocks to wear out that could not be let down; and her\r\nmother settled the question according to that for the present.\r\n\r\nThere was another thing that gave her a vague suspicion of being grown\r\nup, and that was cards.\r\n\r\nThe \"quality\" used visiting-cards; but it would have been considered\r\nunderbred and pretentious to sow them around in the modern manner. They\r\nwere kept for state occasions. Of course Dolly and Margaret had them;\r\nand Hanny thought Joseph B. Underhill, M. D., looked extremely elegant.\r\nJim had some written ones in exquisite penmanship. He had not given up\r\nsociety because one girl had proved false and deceitful. He made a\r\npoint of bowing distantly to Mrs. Williamson, and flushed even now at\r\nthe thought of having been such a ninny!\r\n\r\nDaisy Jasper's name was on her mother's cards. But you couldn't persuade\r\nMrs. Underhill into any such nonsense. She declared if Joe brought her\r\nhome any, she would put them in the fire. One day, however, he dropped a\r\nsmall white box into Hanny's lap, as she sat in his easy-chair, studying\r\nher lessons. It was too small for confectionery; it might be--she had\r\ncoveted a pair of bracelets.\r\n\r\nSo she looked up with an inquiring smile.\r\n\r\n\"Open it, and see if they suit.\"\r\n\r\nShe was sure then it was bracelets.\r\n\r\nThere was white tissue-paper and something stiff. She tumbled the\r\ncontents out in her lap. A few cards fell the plain side up. She turned\r\none over. In very delicate script she saw--\r\n\r\n\"Miss Nan Underhill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" with a cry of delight. They called her Nan altogether at\r\nStephen's, and the school-girls wrote her name in that manner. She often\r\nused it in writing notes. It looked so very attractive now.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you lovely Joe!\"\r\n\r\n\"They are nice to use with your girl-friends. There are a great many\r\nlittle society regulations that show refinement and good breeding, and I\r\nwant you to observe them. When you get to be a middle-aged woman, Hannah\r\nAnn will look solid and dignified. I consulted Daisy and Mrs. Jasper,\r\nand both approved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a thousand thanks,\" and she threw up her arms to bring his face\r\ndown within kissing reach.\r\n\r\nThe long skirt was settled by a rather peculiar circumstance.\r\n\r\nWe were beginning to have real literary aspirations, and some writers\r\nwho attracted attention abroad. Miss Bremer had found a great many\r\nthings to like in us; and Jenny Lind had been enthusiastic. Some\r\nEnglishmen of note had been over and found we were not a nation of\r\nsavages or red men, and that the best and highest in English literature\r\nwas not unknown to us. Several of our writers had been abroad; and there\r\nwas growing up a spirit of cordiality.\r\n\r\nThen Thackeray was coming over to lecture on The English Humourists.\r\nNearly everybody went to reading him. Some because it was, as we should\r\nsay now, a \"fad;\" others because they wanted to appear conversant with\r\nhis works; and a few because they had learned to understand and to love\r\nthe wonderful touches of the master-pen. Boston received him with open\r\narms. Then he was to visit the principal cities.\r\n\r\nBen and Delia were tremendously interested; and most of their talk was\r\nspiced with bits and quotations, and the telling scenes from his novels.\r\nDelia was beginning to have a good deal of discrimination and judgment.\r\nSometimes, in moments of discouragement, she admitted to Ben that she\r\nwas afraid she really hadn't any genius. Her novel had been recast ever\r\nso many times, and still languished.\r\n\r\nBen brought up tickets for Mr. Thackeray's second lecture. He had gone\r\nto the first one, and meant to hear them all. Joe must take Hanny, who\r\nwould always regret it if she didn't hear him. He had seen Mr. Jasper;\r\nand they were all going the same evening.\r\n\r\nJoe had meant to hear him. He was fond of hearing and seeing notable\r\npeople, and kept his mind freshened up with all that was going on in the\r\ngreat world.\r\n\r\nHanny was delighted, of course, though the fact of listening with Daisy\r\nbeside her added a great deal. They had an enthusiastic, rather\r\nschool-girlish friendship. Daisy's mind was, of course, the more\r\nexperienced. But with youthful fervor they were training themselves into\r\nperfect accord, _en rapport_, so they could look at each other and\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThere was a really fine audience. And when the large, burly,\r\nbroad-chested Englishman stepped on the platform, he had a cordial and\r\nenthusiastic welcome.\r\n\r\nThis evening he was at his best. His manner was clear and engaging; he\r\nmoved his audience to tears and smiles. There was satire and tenderness\r\nand the marvellous insight that made him absolutely personify the\r\nwriters he touched upon. The audience was charmed.\r\n\r\nHanny could not decide upon him. She was being won against her will,\r\nrather her preconceived notions; and yet her first feelings about him\r\nwould return to disturb her. Mr. and Mrs. Jasper were delighted beyond\r\nexpression; Joe was deeply interested, though he confessed he did not\r\nknow Thackeray as he ought. He had read only one or two of the novels\r\nand the \"Yellowplush Papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to read 'Vanity Fair' over again,\" said Hanny, when they\r\nreached home. \"I didn't like it, really and truly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are hardly old enough to enjoy such things,\" returned Joe. \"Even I\r\nhave not made up my mind, and I know I would not have liked them at\r\nseventeen. We believe in heroes and great deeds then, and the\r\npossibilities of life look grander to us than they do afterward. I\r\nsuppose it is right that we should want to be _pleased_ then.\"\r\n\r\nHanny felt that she wanted to be pleased with a story, or else very\r\nsorry for the misfortunes that no human power could seem to avert. But\r\nwhen mean and shallow and selfish people caused their own trials, were\r\nthey worthy of sympathy?\r\n\r\nThey talked at school with the wide diversity of crude, girlish\r\nopinions. The papers were full of him as well.\r\n\r\nBen was one of his enthusiastic admirers. And now they planned to give a\r\nbanquet,--printers and newspaper-men,--and Mr. Thackeray was to be the\r\nguest of the occasion; there was to be a dinner, with some of the bright\r\nliterary lights, music, and dancing,--a really grand affair. Theodore\r\nWhitney was on the committee; and Ben had a lesser position. They meant\r\nto make it the affair of the season. Joe must surely take tickets. It\r\nwas such a shame Dolly couldn't go; and, of course, Steve wouldn't.\r\nJohn and Cleanthe were not interested in such things; and, after\r\nthinking it over, Mrs. Hoffman declined.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to look up a girl,\" said Joe. \"Hanny, you have never been\r\nto a ball. Would you like to go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I think a ball would be splendid! If Daisy could go, or Dolly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Daisy's mother or Dolly would have to go.\"\r\n\r\nThat gave him an idea, and he went down to see Mrs. Jasper.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I really think I would like to go myself,\" she said. \"We do not\r\nconsider Daisy quite a grown-up lady. I should like to keep her just a\r\nyoung girl for a long while; but, perhaps, that will not be possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanny is a very young girl,\" returned Joe. \"And I do not think father\r\ncould stand it to have her grown up. But she keeps so small, I don't\r\njust know how we should get mother coaxed around. Both girls would enjoy\r\nit immensely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she would trust her with Mr. Jasper and me, if we were to take\r\nDaisy. Dear me--one festivity doesn't really signify. And yet--\" she\r\nblushed and smiled with a certain girlishness. \"They may be dangerous; I\r\nwent to a Christmas ball when I was sixteen, and met Mr. Jasper. I was\r\nout on a holiday,--a mere school-girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe Hanny or Daisy will find any one to fall in love\r\nwith,\" said Joe, seriously; \"they are so in love with each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes. They are planning to live together. There must be a\r\nsettlement; for both will have to bring their respective families.\"\r\n\r\nJoe was a good deal amused at that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE GIRL GROWN UP\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill said \"No.\" It was not to be thought of for a moment.\r\nHanny in short frocks!\r\n\r\n\"It would have to be made long in the skirt, I suppose,\" returned Joe,\r\ngravely.\r\n\r\n\"Long! What are you talking about!\"\r\n\r\n\"She would enjoy seeing the dancing. And when she was an old lady, and\r\nThackeray dead, she could tell her children she was at a banquet with\r\nthe great novelist.\"\r\n\r\n\"What nonsense you do talk, Joe.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe laughed, gave his mother a squeeze and a kiss that brought\r\nthe bright colour to her cheek, and then went off to comfort two rich\r\nold patients who had nothing the matter with them, except the\r\ninfirmities of age. They thought there was no one like Dr. Underhill.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his mother thought so, too. She was taking a good deal of\r\ncomfort with him in these days, when she had cast Ben a little out of\r\nher good graces. She had a hope that Ben's sturdy common sense would\r\nconvince him after a while that Delia would make a poor, improvident\r\nwife. And there was a chance that, while Ben was waiting to get ready,\r\nsome one might capture Delia. She sincerely hoped it would be some one\r\nwell-to-do and deserving, and who could afford servants and a generous\r\nhousehold expenditure. Ben would get over it in time.\r\n\r\nAnd much as she enjoyed Joe, she wanted him to marry and have a home and\r\nfamily of his very own. But was any one good enough for such a sweet,\r\ngenerous, noble soul!\r\n\r\nOf course Hanny couldn't go; that was a foregone conclusion. But then\r\nthe Jaspers were going, and it wasn't like taking a young girl out in\r\nsociety. Just one night would not matter. Daisy had been to several\r\ngrown-up festivities abroad, where they were ever so much more strenuous\r\nabout girls. There would be so many people, they would pass in the\r\nthrong unnoticed; and it was not like a public ball.\r\n\r\nIt was a little odd, but Miss Cynthia settled it finally. Her verdict\r\nseemed to settle a good many things. She did not \"dress-make\" very\r\nsteadily now; but there were some folks who thought they couldn't have a\r\nwedding, or a large party, without Miss Cynthia's advice and assistance.\r\n\r\nShe came to spend the day. Grandmother Van Kortlandt enjoyed her very\r\nmuch, as she could not visit a great deal herself. Cynthia always had\r\nthe latest news about all the relatives. She gossiped in a bright social\r\nfashion, with no especial ill-nature, or sharp criticism, indeed her\r\nsharpnesses were amusing for the bit of real fun in them.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course she ought to go,\" declared Miss Cynthia. \"I'd like to\r\nsee the great man myself, and shake hands with him, though I am not over\r\nfond of the English; and I do hope and pray he won't go home and make\r\nfun of us. As for the dancing, and all that, Peggy Underhill, you went\r\nto lots of frolics before you were as old as Hanny, and had young men\r\nbeauing you round. I don't see but you have made a good and capable wife\r\nand mother; and it didn't hurt you a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I was not going to school.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't the fashion then. And now women are in Oberlin College,\r\nstudying the same things as the men; and they fall in love and get\r\nmarried just as they always did. The ball, or whatever you call it,\r\nwon't hurt Hanny a bit. There will be the Jaspers, and Joe, and Ben, and\r\nI'm sure that's enough to take care of one little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has nothing to wear; she is still in short frocks. And the idea of\r\nbuying a ball-dress, that she won't want until next winter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now see here. Let's look over the old things. There's her blue silk,\r\noutgrown of course. They ruffle everything now, and it will be wide\r\nenough for that. And I can just cover the waist, and ruffle the skirt\r\nwith white tarleton. It is nearly two yards wide, and makes lovely\r\ntrimming. There's no use saving it up for Stephen's children.\"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed at that.\r\n\r\n\"And, Aunt Marg'ret,\" to grandmother, \"why didn't you keep _your_ little\r\ngirl shut up in a band-box, while all the other girls were having good\r\ntimes and getting lovers? She might have been a queer, particular,\r\nfidgety old maid, instead of having a nice family for us to quarrel\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will buy her a new dress,\" said grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"She doesn't want anything but a few yards of tarleton. She won't be\r\nlikely to get into the papers. She and Miss Daisy will sit and look on,\r\nand just whisper to each other, and feel afraid to say their souls are\r\ntheir own; but they'll enjoy the pretty dressing and the dancing, and\r\nthey will see how the thing is done when it comes their turn in good\r\nearnest.\"\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Underhill had to give in. Grandmother slipped five dollars in\r\nMiss Cynthia's hand, as she was going away.\r\n\r\n\"If that falls short, I'll give you some more. And you just buy that\r\ntarleton.\"\r\n\r\nHanny wasn't quite sure, and never said a word at school until the very\r\nday. But she and Daisy had a thrill of delight talking it over. Miss\r\nCynthia came armed with the tarleton. The skirt was let down; but girls'\r\nlong dresses were not sweeping length in those days. Then it was covered\r\nwith narrow ruffles that suggested drifting clouds over an azure sky.\r\nThe bodice was not outgrown, after all. It was covered with the\r\ntarleton, and had a fall of beautiful old lace around the shoulders, a\r\npretty frill at the neck, and short sleeves. Joe bought her white\r\ngloves, and she had a blue sash.\r\n\r\nMiss Cynthia came in to dress her; but the little girl had a quivering\r\nfear that something had happened to her maid, for it was full eight\r\no'clock. She put her back hair in a French twist, much worn then, with\r\ntwo big rings right on the top of her head that looked like a crown. Her\r\nfront hair she curled over an iron, and then combed it out; and it was a\r\nmass of fluffy waves, gathered in bandeaux just above her ears. She had\r\nher mother's beautiful pearl earrings, that had come from France with\r\nthe old French grandmother, and a handsome mother-of-pearl-topped comb\r\nin her hair.\r\n\r\nThey put on the ball-dress. \"Now look at yourself,\" said Miss Cynthia,\r\n\"and get used to it before I let in the folks.\"\r\n\r\nHanny stood before her mother's tall mirror. Oh, this was Miss Nan\r\nUnderhill, and she had never seen her before. There was a mystery about\r\nher,--a sudden sense of a strange, beautiful, unseen world, a new\r\ncountry she was going into, an old world left behind, an intangible\r\nrecreation that no words could explain, but that touched her with a\r\nkind of exalted sacredness, as if a new life was unfolding all about\r\nher. She hardly dared stir or breathe.\r\n\r\n\"For a girl with no special beauty, I think you look very well. But,\r\nland sakes! You'll see no end of handsome girls; Margaret and Jim\r\ncarried off the beauty of this family.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Cynthia's voice recalled her from the vision of coming womanhood,\r\nthat she was to live over again on her wedding night, with its holy\r\nblessedness enshrining her within her bridal veil.\r\n\r\nHer father's eyes shone with a softness that looked like tears. Her\r\nmother viewed her all over with a critical air.\r\n\r\n\"I must say, Cynthia, you've done wonderfully. The dress looks very\r\nnice. And now, Hanny, I do hope you won't be forward or silly. Mind\r\neverything Mrs. Jasper says, and don't you and Daisy giggle. Be careful\r\nand don't lose Margaret's handkerchief. I don't just know as you ought\r\nto carry that.\"\r\n\r\nJoe said she was lovely; and Jim really was very complimentary. He _did_\r\nwish that he was going. But Jim counted the cost of everything now, for\r\nhe was trying to get out of debt.\r\n\r\nThe coach came up from the Jaspers' and Hanny was put inside. Joe\r\ninsisted on sharing the box with the driver.\r\n\r\nWhen Daisy took off her wrap in the dressing-room, she had on a pale\r\npink silk. Part of her curls were tied up in a bunch on top of her head,\r\nand fastened with a silver arrow and two roses. She would always wear it\r\nin ringlets, or at least until she was so old she wouldn't mind about\r\nher shoulders being not quite straight.\r\n\r\nThe affair was a banquet primarily. To be sure they gathered in the\r\nAssembly room; and there was Ben, and Delia, who looked very nice and\r\nbright in maize colour and brown.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Hanny, you are as lovely as a picture,\" she whispered\r\nenthusiastically. \"But you _are_ a little mite; there is no denying it.\r\nI was so afraid you couldn't come, that something would happen at the\r\nlast moment. Miss Cynthia is capital.\"\r\n\r\nHanny coloured and almost sighed. She might as well give up hoping to be\r\ntall, and accept the fact.\r\n\r\nThey went into the banquet-room, where there were two long tables. They\r\npassed around to where a circle of men stood, some of them very fine\r\nlooking indeed. The advancing group were presented to the great\r\nnovelist, and in future years Hanny was to treasure the cordial smile\r\nand pressure of the hand. But he was to come again when the world had\r\nlearned to pay him a finer and more discriminating admiration.\r\n\r\nHis end of the table was literary. The Jasper party were opposite, at\r\nthe other one. What brightness and wit spiced the party, they could\r\ngather from the genial laughter. There were toasts and responses that\r\nscintillated with gaiety and touched the border of pathos.\r\n\r\nIt was long, and of course the younger people who came for the ball were\r\nnot compelled to stay. The novelist was to leave at the close of the\r\ndinner. And presently most of the company found their way to the dancing\r\nroom, where the band was discoursing enchanting music, and where every\r\none enjoyed the promenade.\r\n\r\nBut when the quadrille sets were formed and in motion, Hanny was\r\nenraptured. Ben and Delia were among them. Delia certainly had a\r\nfrivolous side to her nature for a genius. She was very fond of fun and\r\npleasure and dancing, and had no lack of partners all the evening.\r\n\r\nSome there were who danced like a fairy dream; others who made blunders\r\nand gave the wrong hand, and betrayed various awkwardnesses. Doctor Joe\r\nfound several lady friends, and danced two or three times, then\r\nproposed that Hanny should try, which he was sure \"would inspire Daisy\r\ninto making the attempt,\" he said with a persuasive smile.\r\n\r\nHanny was very much afraid out on the large space. But Delia was in the\r\nsame set, and her bright merry eyes were full of encouragement. It was\r\nnot alarming. Indeed, in five minutes, the music had put a \"spirit in\r\nher feet,\" and she felt quite at home.\r\n\r\nThen a friend of Ben's came to ask her; and Doctor Joe sat down to\r\npersuade Daisy. While abroad, she had taken what we should now term a\r\nseries of physical culture lessons to strengthen and develop her limbs,\r\nand to learn how to overcome her misfortune in every possible manner.\r\nIndeed, it was hardly noticeable now, and she had outgrown the\r\nsensitiveness of her childhood.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mamma, do you think I could?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course she can,\" declared Doctor Joe. \"I can't have you playing wall\r\nflower altogether at your first ball. And if you drop down in surprise,\r\nor faint away, I will carry you to the dressing-room at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe was so tender and full of nonsense, yet so much in earnest, that she\r\nrose reluctantly. But like Hanny, with the eager joy of youth, she soon\r\nforgot everything except the pure pleasure, and the delight of\r\ngratifying dear Doctor Joe, who was so strong and gentle that she could\r\nnot even feel a bit nervous.\r\n\r\nAs for Hanny, she was really enchanted. The room full of people,\r\nsmiling and happy, the changing figures, the light airy dresses, the\r\nshimmer of silks, the cloudlets of lace, the soft flying curls, for so\r\nmany people wore ringlets still, the happy smiling faces, and the throb\r\nof the music was intoxicating. It was a strange, delightful world that\r\nshe had gone into with her first long gown and her hair done up.\r\n\r\nShe came back, flushed and excited, her pretty eyes shining, her red\r\nlips all in a quiver.\r\n\r\n\"Now you must sit down and rest,\" said Mrs. Jasper. \"And if you are very\r\nobedient, you may get up in that Spanish dance. I think that quite\r\ndelightful and bewildering.\"\r\n\r\nA lady sat on the other side of Mrs. Jasper, and resumed the incident\r\nshe was describing. Mr. Jasper came up with a young man.\r\n\r\n\"Here is an old friend!\" he exclaimed. \"Where is Daisy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere with the Doctor. Oh, what a surprise!\" and she took the young\r\nman's hand.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't sure I could get here; and it would have been very ungrateful\r\nto Mr. Jasper, when he sent me a ticket. I wanted to see Miss Daisy\r\nagain. But I have just come on a flying business tour, and must start\r\nto-morrow for Philadelphia. Still, I may have a little leisure when I\r\nreturn. What a gay scene.\"\r\n\r\nHanny sat fanning herself, and feeling that her cheeks were scarlet. If\r\nit only wouldn't culminate in her nose! Then Mr. Jasper turned and\r\nintroduced his young friend. Hanny moved a little, so he could sit\r\nbetween her and Mrs. Jasper,--a very attractive young man, a Mr.\r\nAndersen.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Underhill,\" he repeated, as Mr. Jasper turned away, \"I've been\r\nspeculating on a Miss Underhill for five minutes. I wonder if you will\r\nconsider it impertinent; but perhaps you never speculate upon people,\r\nand then it might be reprehensible. Just as I entered the room, there\r\nwas a merry group talking, and a sort of 'nut brown mayde,' all in brown\r\nand yellow with bright hair and laughing eyes said, 'Miss Nan\r\nUnderhill.' Of course I was too well bred, and in too great a hurry to\r\nlisten to any more, or I might have found out about her. I had just an\r\ninstant interior gleam of what she must be like with that English name.\r\nAnd I wonder if the fates have directed my steps to her?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Andersen was not the tall, stern, gloomy hero of romance; he was\r\nmedium in height and figure, with a frank, eager sort of face, dark\r\nhair, and eyes she thought black then, but afterwards came to know that\r\nthey were of the deep blue of a midnight sky in winter. He had such a\r\nsmiling mouth, and his voice had a curious, lingering cadence that\r\nsuggests that one may have heard it in a previous state.\r\n\r\nHanny caught the spirit of the half badinage, and the laughing light in\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"I think I ought to know the ideal before I confess identity,\" she\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n\"Can't I change the ideal? Or repent my vague, wild fancy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, was it wild? Then I must insist upon it. Miss Nan Underhill, an\r\nEnglish girl; of course she was tall, this vision of your imagination?\"\r\n\r\nHanny was quite sure her face grew redder. And this ideal girl was\r\nbeautiful. Oh, dear!\r\n\r\n\"Yes, tall; a daughter of the gods, or the old Norse Vikings before they\r\nwere Anglicised, with fair hair. And you have the fair hair.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not tall! I am sorry to have you disappointed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not disappointed. What does a vagrant fancy amount to? I consider\r\nmyself fortunate in meeting Miss Underhill. Why, suppose I had gone\r\nrambling about and missed you altogether? Have you known the Jaspers\r\nlong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, years and years. Before they went abroad.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a beautiful girl Daisy is! I am glad she is here enjoying herself.\r\nOh, isn't it the regulation thing to speak of the hero of the feast? Of\r\ncourse when you heard he was coming to lecture you began to read his\r\nnovels--if you had not before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had not read them before. There are a great many books I have not\r\nread. But I tried at 'Vanity Fair;' and I am afraid I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe you will now. I can't imagine real young people liking\r\nthem. But when one has grown older and had sorrow and suffering and\r\nexperience, there are so many touches that go to one's heart. And\r\n'Vanity Fair' is a novel without a hero. Still I always feel sorry for\r\npoor Major Dobbins. I wonder if Amelia would have liked him better if\r\nhis name had been something else? Could you fall in love with such a\r\nname?\"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed. She raised her eyes. How exquisitely fair and sweet\r\nand dainty she was! The soft hair had shining lights; and her eyes had a\r\ntwilight look that suggested a pellucid lake, with evening shades\r\nblowing over it.\r\n\r\n\"A little more of something would have made him a hero, and spoiled the\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't like Amelia, nor Becky; and the Crawleys are horrid. And\r\nThackeray seems holding up everybody and laughing at them. I like to\r\nbelieve in people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad there is a time when we can believe in them: it is the\r\nradiant time of youth. What did that little smile hide, and half betray?\r\nConfess!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you so very old?\"\r\n\r\nThe charming gravity was irresistible.\r\n\r\n\"Seven and twenty, and I am beginning to worship Thackeray. At seven and\r\nthirty, he will be one of my passions, I know. Now and then I come to a\r\nsentence that goes to my heart. No, do not read him yet awhile, unless\r\nit is some of the little things. There is 'Dr. Birch and his Young\r\nFriends;' and if you want to be amused you must read his continuation of\r\n'Ivanhoe.' But then you will have neither heroines nor heroes left. And\r\nif you and Miss Daisy want to laugh beyond measure, get the 'Rose and\r\nthe Ring,' that he wrote for his two little girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Hanny, \"are they at home, in England?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, with an aunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't they any mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have no mother,\" he said gravely.\r\n\r\nYears later, the novelist was to be one of the little girl's heroes,\r\nwhen she knew all the bravery of his life, and why his little girls were\r\nwithout a mother.\r\n\r\nJoe and Daisy returned, and there was a pleasant rencontre; then Delia\r\nand Ben came up, and they had a merry chat and a promenade.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" as the musicians began tuning again, \"if you are engaged for\r\nall the dances. Could I be allowed one?\"\r\n\r\nHe took up her card.\r\n\r\n\"I have been dancing so much already; but Mrs. Jasper said I might try\r\nthe Spanish dance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then try it with me! I am not too old to dance, if I have come to\r\nadoring Thackeray. And I am to go away soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"To go away--where?\" And she glanced up with an interest that gave him a\r\nquick sense of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"To Hamburg first; then to find some relations.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Germany? But you are not a German?\" in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to be a Dane, if one's birth counts for anything; and if one's\r\nancestors count, then an old Dutch Knickerbocker,\" he returned, with a\r\nsoft, amused laugh. \"But I believe I cannot boast of any English\r\ndescent, such as the son of a hundred earls. That doesn't sound as\r\npoetic as the daughter of a hundred earls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was not one to be desired,\" interposed the young girl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you read Tennyson then? It is odd, but a good many of us begin on\r\npoetry. I like it very much myself.\"\r\n\r\nA touch of thought settled between Hanny's brows.\r\n\r\n\"Are you wondering about my mixed lineage? Part of it came from the old\r\nDutch governor, Jacob Leisler. My grandfather went to Germany, and ran\r\naway with a lady of high degree, and brought her back to America, where\r\nmy father was born, and lived all his young life, until his marriage.\r\nThen business took him abroad, and I was born; and my mother died at\r\nCopenhagen. My father is connected with the importing house of Strang,\r\nZahner, & Co., of which Mr. Jasper is a member. He is married again, to\r\na very sweet, amiable German woman. Oh, here we are to take our places!\"\r\n\r\nHanny hesitated an instant. She longed to have Mrs. Jasper's\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n\"We have been looking for you,\" said Ben. \"Let us begin in the one set.\r\nHere is Daisy and Joe.\"\r\n\r\nThen it would be all right. She glanced up and smiled with cordial\r\nassent.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned Spanish dance was a great favourite at that time, when\r\ngermans were unknown. Its graceful turns and windings, its stately\r\nbalances, until the dancers seemed all one long elegant chain, that\r\nmoved to the perfect time of the music, was indeed fascinating. People\r\ndanced then. Youth never dreamed of being bored, and walking languidly.\r\nEvery movement was delicate and refined.\r\n\r\nWas she really in some enchanted country? When Mr. Andersen was\r\ncompelled to leave her, he glanced over or past his partner with an\r\nexpression so near a smile that Hanny's pulses quickened. When he came\r\nback, the light touch of his hand gave her a little thrill that was\r\nquite delicious. Now and then they had a bit of conversation.\r\n\r\nOnce he said, in his charming fashion, that was admiration rather than\r\ncriticism:--\r\n\r\n\"Why, you _are_ very petite!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I am not the tall, slim English girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad. We dance so well together; I wish I were not going away\r\nso soon. And you can't guess--you will think it strange,--to American\r\nideas it is; but when I go back I have to hunt up a descendant of this\r\ngrandmother of high degree who has been making matrimonial overtures to\r\nmy father on my behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is like a story! And what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will think about it, and answer you when you return to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave her to the next partner, with a graceful inclination of the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThere were numberless evolutions before he could take her again. She\r\nglanced up out of sweet, questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I've been considering,\" he resumed, as if they had not parted. \"You\r\nsee, it is this way. My father is very, very fond of me, though there\r\nare other children. Then I have my mother's fortune, which he has been\r\nvery watchful of. He is a splendid, upright, honourable man. Now, if\r\nyour father asked such a thing of you,--what I mean is, if he asked you\r\nto see some one and learn how well you could like her or him--\"\r\n\r\nShe was off again. Oh, what a sweet little fairy she was! What poet\r\nwrote about twinkling feet? Hers certainly twinkled in their daintiness.\r\nHe had not considered her prettiness at first; now it seemed as if she\r\nwas exquisitely fair, with that soft pink in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Do you not believe you would go to please him, and see? And you\r\nmight not like her, and she might not like you. But sometimes people do\r\ntake sudden fancies. What do you think, looking at it out of an American\r\ngirl's eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should go for my father's sake.\"\r\n\r\nThere was such a delicate gravity in her clear eyes as she raised them a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" he returned softly. \"What an odd thing to talk of in the\r\nmidst of our dancing! When you are older, you will find people making a\r\nconfidante of you very often, you seem so serious and truthful.\"\r\n\r\nThey were coming down to the end of the winding chain; Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJasper stood there. One more figure, and the cornet and horns and\r\nviolins gave three long breaths of melody and stopped.\r\n\r\n\"My dear children,\" said Mrs. Jasper, as she stretched out her hand.\r\n\"Daisy, you will be in bed all day to-morrow! Your mother will never\r\ntrust me with you again, Hanny; I didn't think it would be so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was so delightful, mamma.\" Daisy was in a tumult of pleasure.\r\n\r\n\"We must go at once. Mr. Jasper will be back by the time we have found\r\nour wraps. Doctor, I can't thank you for making such a patient martyr of\r\nyourself, only you are always so good. Hanny, have you had a nice time?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been splendid,\" with a long, long breath, and shining lights in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\nDelia went to the dressing-room with them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to have two more dances,\" she said. \"It is the first real\r\nball I've been to in a long while. I'm so glad you came. Ben says he\r\nnever imagined you were so pretty. Think of that, from one's own\r\nbrother! And Daisy did not shine you down, either.\"\r\n\r\nHanny kissed her with a sort of rapture. She couldn't understand; she\r\nseemed to be walking on the azure clouds instead of solid earth.\r\n\r\nMr. Andersen went to the carriage with them, and said he should surely\r\ncall when he returned from Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDaisy leaned her head down on her mother's shoulder. She was more tired\r\nthan she would admit. Hanny's eyes were like stars, and her brain was\r\nstill filled with wonderful melodies and light airy figures trooping to\r\nthe ravishing sounds, the shimmering light and sparkle. Doctor Joe just\r\ncarried her up the steps, and opened the door with his latch-key. But\r\nMrs. Underhill had heard them, and she came downstairs, wrapped in a\r\nshawl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Joe, how could you keep her out so late! Do you know it's almost\r\nthree o'clock?\"\r\n\r\nThen the mother folded her to her heart. It seemed as if she had been\r\nsnatched from some great danger; and now that she had her safe and\r\nsound, she felt as if she should never let her go again.\r\n\r\n\"You're all excitement, Hanny; you tremble like a leaf. Such\r\ndissipations are bad for growing girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother, I think I'm done growing,\" Hanny laughed, with a soft ring\r\nof music in her voice. \"I have wanted to be tall like Margaret; but now\r\nI do not mind a bit. I think I shall always be father's little girl. And\r\nthe dancing was so delightful; but you can't think how queer and long\r\nthe supper was. And Mr. Thackeray really shook hands with me. He has two\r\nlittle girls, and they haven't any mother. If you could have seen Daisy!\r\nAnd she dances beautifully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanny, your tongue runs like a mill-race. Do keep still, child. Cynthia\r\nhas you pinned in every fashion. I hope your dress looked nice enough\r\nfor a little girl. There, I'll take care of them all. You will never\r\nwant to get up in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she had hung the dress out of sight, she felt as if she had her\r\nlittle girl once more. And the little girl fell asleep to the sound of\r\nthe most delicious music ever floating through one's brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, Hanny Underhill was a little girl again in gaiter-length dresses,\r\nand her braids tied across at the back of her head. They let her sleep\r\nuntil the latest moment; and then she had to hurry off to school. But\r\nher eyes were bright; and she could have danced along the street, if it\r\nhad been the proper thing to do.\r\n\r\nDaisy did not fare so well. She had a headache, and was very languid.\r\nJoe said Hanny had better not go down; and that Daisy would be all right\r\nto-morrow. So Hanny studied her lessons, and began to read \"Vanity Fair\"\r\naloud to grandmother. But grandmother said she didn't care about such a\r\nsilly girl as Amelia; and though there were wretched women in the world,\r\nshe didn't believe any one ever was quite so scheming and heartless as\r\nBecky.\r\n\r\nThen Hanny told her father about the dancing, and the partners she had,\r\nand Mr. Andersen, who was going back to Germany to marry some distant\r\ncousin. Altogether, it was a splendid time, only she felt as if there\r\nhad been some kind of a Cinderella transformation; and that she was\r\nsafe only as long as she wore short frocks.\r\n\r\nA week afterward, Mr. Andersen returned to the city, and Hanny was\r\ninvited down to tea at the Jaspers. They had a nice time, only the talk\r\nwas not quite so charming as when it was interspersed with dancing.\r\n\r\nHe was to go to Paris also. And now Louis Napoleon had followed in the\r\nfootsteps of his illustrious uncle, and was really Emperor of France.\r\nWhat a strange, romantic history his had been!\r\n\r\nAfter this, life went on with tolerable regularity. There was plenty of\r\namusement. Old New York did not suffer. Laura Keene thrilled them with\r\nthe \"Hunchback,\" and many another personation. Matilda Heron was doing\r\nsome fine work in Milman's \"Fazio,\" and the play of \"The Stranger\" held\r\naudiences spell-bound. Then there were lectures for the more\r\nsober-minded people; and you heard youngish men who were to be famous\r\nafterward. Spirit-rappings had fallen a trifle into disfavour; and\r\nphrenology was making converts. It was the proper thing to go to\r\nFowler's and have your head examined, and get a chart, which sort of\r\nsettled you until something else came along. Young ladies were going\r\ninto Combe's physiology and hygiene and cold bathing. Some very hardy\r\nand courageous women were studying medicine. Emerson was in a certain\r\nway rivalling Carlyle. Wendell Phillips was enchanting the cities with\r\nhis silver tongue. There had been Brooke Farm; and Margaret Fuller had\r\nflashed across the world, married her Italian lover, who fought while\r\nshe wrote for liberty; and husband, wife, and child had met their tragic\r\ndeath in very sight of her native land.\r\n\r\nPeople were thinking really great thoughts; and there was a ferment of\r\nmoral, transcendental, and æsthetical philosophy. Women met to discuss\r\nthem in each other's parlours, prefiguring the era of clubs. Alice and\r\nPh[oe]be Cary's receptions had grown to be quite the rage; and Anne C.\r\nLynch was another figure in the social-literary world. Beecher was\r\ndrawing large audiences in Brooklyn, and telling the old truths in a new\r\nfashion. There is always a great seething and tumult before the water\r\nfairly boils and precipitates the dregs to the bottom.\r\n\r\nBut whatever comes and goes, young girls are always growing up with the\r\nflush and fragrance and elusive fascinations of spring. To-day, a\r\ncredulous tenderness and overwhelming faith in the past; to-morrow, a\r\nlittle doubtful, hesitatingly anticipative, with the watchwords of \"The\r\nTrue, the Good, and the Beautiful;\" and still concerned in the latest\r\nstyle of doing one's back hair, and if silver combs and gilt pins would\r\nkeep in fashion; and flushing celestial rosy red, yet with an odd sense\r\nof importance, when men began to lift their hats in a gravely polite\r\nmanner, as if the laughing, hoydenish girl of yesterday, who strung\r\nherself out four or five wide on the sidewalk with books in hand, was\r\nthe shy, refined, hesitating, utterly delicious young woman of to-day.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Hanny stood on the mysterious borderland. She used\r\nto steal up and look at the wraith of a ball-dress hanging in the\r\nthird-floor closet, put away with the \"choice\" garments. The skirt\r\nlooked so long, almost uncanny. She could see the girl who had gone to\r\nthe banquet, who had danced with young men who asked \"the pleasure\" with\r\nthe politest inclination of the head. And, oh, the lovely dances she had\r\nwith Mr. Andersen! The bewitching Spanish movement floated through her\r\nbrain; and the young man's voice--what a curious, lingering sweetness it\r\nhad--went over her like a wave of music. Of course his German cousin\r\nwould fall in love with him,--how could she help it?--and they would\r\nmarry. They would go to Paris once a year or so, when business took him;\r\nthey would go over to London; but their real home would be in some\r\nGerman town, or maybe in the castle from which the pretty grandmother\r\nhad run away with her American lover. She was so glad there were real\r\nromances left in the world. It wasn't likely any would happen to her.\r\nShe was not tall, nor elegant, nor handsome; and though she could sing\r\n\"Bonnie Doon,\" \"Annie Laurie,\" \"A Rose-tree in Full Bearing,\" and \"The\r\nGirl I Left behind me,\" for her father, she was not a company singer.\r\nBut she really didn't mind. Her father would want her. She wasn't quite\r\nresigned to being an old maid; but then she need not worry until she was\r\ntwenty-five. And when you came to that, half the relatives were fighting\r\nfor Miss Cynthia Blackfan; and Mr. Erastus Morgan had invited her over\r\nto Paris to see the new Emperor, who was copying in every way his\r\ngranduncle who had ruled half Europe.\r\n\r\nThen she would close the closet door and run blithely downstairs with a\r\nbit of song. That was Miss Nan Underhill up there; and in her short\r\nschool-girl frock she was plain household Hanny.\r\n\r\nBut they had delightful times. Doctor Joe bought a new buggy, very wide\r\nin the seat, and used to take her and Daisy out when the days were\r\npleasant. Then Charles and Josie came over evenings, or they went to\r\nMrs. Dean's, and talked and sang and discussed their favourite poems and\r\nstories, and thought how rich the world was growing, and wondered how\r\ntheir grandfathers and grandmothers had existed!\r\n\r\nThe little rue in the Underhills' cup became sweetened presently with\r\nthe balm of love and forbearance, that time or circumstances usually\r\nbrings about when truth and good sense are at the helm.\r\n\r\nMatters had gone rather hard with Delia Whitney of late. In a certain\r\nfashion, she had come to the parting of the intellectual ways. People\r\nwere as eager then as now to discover new geniuses. There were not so\r\nmany writing, and it was easier to gain a hearing. She had been\r\nsuccessful. She had been praised; her stories and poems were accepted,\r\npublished, and paid for. She had been made much of by her brother's\r\nfriends, and some of the literary women she had met.\r\n\r\nShe began to realise it was not altogether wandering at one's sweet\r\nwill, unless one had a garden of unfailing bloom in which to gather the\r\nflowers of poetry, or even prose. There were greater heights than even\r\ngirlhood's visions. But there must be training and study to reach them,\r\nand she had been lilting along in a desultory way, like a careless\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nBut had she any real genius? When she bent her whole mind to the\r\ncultivation of every energy, what if she should find it was energy and\r\nimagination merely? Her novel did not progress to her satisfaction.\r\nCharacters might be common-place; but there was to be force enough in\r\ntheir delineation to keep the attention of the reader. They must be\r\nclear-cut, vivid; and hers seemed all too much alike, with no salient\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose no one ever felt discouraged before?\" asked Ben, with\r\nhis brave, sweet smile. \"That's no sign.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I really wasn't a genius? And I have had so many splendid plans\r\nand plots in my brain; but when they come out, they are flat and weak. I\r\ndon't ever expect to stand on the top-most round; but I can't stay down\r\nat the bottom always. I would rather not be anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nBen comforted her in his quiet fashion.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what should I do without you!\" she cried. \"I want to achieve\r\nsomething for your sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will achieve. And if you do not, there is enjoyment left. You\r\ninspire other people.\"\r\n\r\n\"With a kind of girlish nonsense that passes for wit. But older minds\r\ndemand the real article.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a certain brightness of talk that brings out the best in other\r\npeople. That is a rare gift, I am beginning to observe. Put the novel by\r\nfor a little while.\"\r\n\r\n\"But every time I take it out, it seems worse,\" she returned ruefully.\r\n\r\nThen she admitted another worry.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Patty stumbled and fell about a month ago in her room. She was\r\nlame for some days; and I can see she isn't quite the same. Mother\r\nthinks it was a stroke. She is old, you know, and if she should be laid\r\nup! She clings to me so. You see, she misses Nora, who was running in\r\nand out, and the young girls who came here, and--oh, Ben, I am afraid I\r\nam growing stupid!\"\r\n\r\nBen laughed and kissed her, and told her not to cross bridges until she\r\ncame to them.\r\n\r\nThen Theodore went to Washington for a fortnight; and Ben felt that it\r\nwas hard for Delia to be bereft of that useful article, a man around the\r\nhouse. When Theodore returned, there was an imperative journey to the\r\nWest. Already there were clouds rising that disquieted the wisest\r\nstatesmen who were studying how to prevent any outward clashing. Mr.\r\nWhitney, with his _savoir faire_, was considered one of the best men to\r\nsend on a _quasi_ political mission.\r\n\r\n\"You just drop in to supper every evening, Ben,\" he said with his\r\nGood-bye. \"Dele has a head worth that of any half-dozen women; but I\r\nlike to feel some one is looking after her. Mother is away a good deal.\"\r\n\r\nThe. had a misgiving Ben and Delia might want to marry; but they\r\ncouldn't possibly spare Delia. So he was very friendly and obliging to\r\nBen.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" oddly enough, was taking a great interest in the small end of\r\nthe woman question, that was pushing its way in among other things. Mr.\r\nWhitney had been the most indulgent of husbands, and her sons had\r\naccepted household discomforts with no grumbling. But she took most\r\nkindly to the emancipation of women. She had a friend in Brooklyn who\r\nwas lecturing on the subject; and she had vague aspirations that way\r\nherself. She was still a woman of fine presence and a fair share of\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\nBridget had married, and been superseded by an untrained Katy. Aunt\r\nPatty was growing rather weak-hearted and childish, so Delia did have\r\nher hands full, and but little time for writing.\r\n\r\nTheodore had been absent hardly a week when the stroke came. One\r\nmorning, Aunt Patty was unable to move hand or foot on one side, and\r\ncould hardly speak intelligibly, though her face kept its sweet\r\nexpression. Mrs. Whitney had gone away somewhere with her friend.\r\n\r\nWhen Ben heard the sad story that night, and folded the trembling,\r\nsobbing girl to his heart, his resolve was taken. A nurse had come, to\r\nbe sure; but Delia should not bear this trial alone. He must live here,\r\nand comfort her with his love.\r\n\r\nHe went home quite early that evening. His father and Hanny were in\r\nJoe's study; his mother sat alone, darning stockings.\r\n\r\nShe glanced up and smiled; but when she saw his grave face, she said,\r\n\"Oh, Ben, what has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are in great trouble down at Beach Street. Old Aunt Boudinot has\r\nhad a stroke of paralysis. Mrs. Whitney has gone on a little journey\r\nwith a friend; and Delia is alone. Mother, I have resolved to be married\r\nand help her bear her burthen. There is no immediate danger of Miss\r\nBoudinot dying, I believe; but since The. is away--they need some one--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben!\"\r\n\r\nThen she looked in her boy's face. Benny Frank and Jim were still boys\r\nto her. There was Joe to be married before it came their turn, and poor\r\nGeorge, if he should live to come back. But it was not a boy's face, nor\r\na boy's pleading eyes, that met hers. A man's grave sweetness, and sense\r\nof responsibility, shone in the clear, deep grey orbs, and the whole\r\nface had matured, so that she was amazed, bewildered.\r\n\r\n\"Mother dear,\" he began, \"can't you wish me God speed, as you have the\r\nothers? I've never loved any one but Delia; I never shall. I know I can\r\nmake her happy; and isn't there some duty on my side? Am I to demand\r\neverything, and throw out a few crumbs of comfort now and then? We have\r\nknown each other long enough to be quite sure, quite satisfied. But she\r\nhas said all along she would not marry me until she could be considered\r\na daughter of the house. I shall persuade her to now, unless--mother,\r\ncan't you give her a welcome?\"\r\n\r\nHe put his arms about his mother's neck. Was there some mysterious\r\nstrength and manliness in him she had not realised before, even in his\r\nvery voice. When had she lost her boy? What a pang went to her inmost\r\nheart. Yes, he was a man, and he had a right to himself. She was not a\r\nselfish woman; but her face dropped down on his shoulder and she cried\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother--dear.\" There was a sweet, faint break in his voice, and he\r\nkissed her brow softly.\r\n\r\n\"You have been such a good boy, Ben. I've been a little worried\r\nsometimes about Jim; but you have gone on so straight and steadfast. I\r\ndo thank the Lord for all of you. And I have wanted you to have the\r\nbest--\"\r\n\r\n\"She is the best to me, mother. Like her a little for my sake,\" he\r\npleaded tenderly.\r\n\r\n\"I _do_ like her. If she makes you happy--\"\r\n\r\nThat was all. If Delia made her son as happy as Dolly or Cleanthe--\r\n\r\nBen kissed his mother. Ten years ago she had thought kissing rather\r\nfoolish for anybody but the little girl. Now her big sons always kissed\r\nher. Perhaps there was more love in the world.\r\n\r\nThey began to make plans presently. Ben was in favour of a quiet\r\nmarriage; and of course he would remain at Beach Street. Delia had\r\npromised to care for her aunt; and there was no one else to take\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know as I have been just right about it,\" said Mrs. Underhill.\r\n\"But Mrs. Whitney's carelessness and inefficiency have always tried me.\r\nStill, the children have turned out well. Delia is smart, and capable;\r\nand since you are quite resolved--\"\r\n\r\nBen smiled then; and it went to his mother's heart. He knew he had won\r\nthe victory.\r\n\r\nThe next morning she said to him:--\r\n\r\n\"Ben, I've decided to go down and see Delia. I have never been there but\r\nonce, since they went to Beach Street. Could you stop and tell her? Give\r\nher my love. I'm very sorry all this should happen, and she alone.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Underhill was not given to half-hearted measures. When the work was\r\ndone, and the dinner planned out, she dressed herself and went\r\ndown-town. Delia was a little embarrassed at first; but they talked\r\nabout Aunt Boudinot, and she went up to see her. The sweet old face\r\nlighted up, and she reached out her \"best hand,\" in a sad sort of\r\nfashion; but she could utter only one word at a time.\r\n\r\n\"Ben said, I must keep you to dinner, and he would come up,\" exclaimed\r\nDelia, with a bright blush. It was so like old times to hear her\r\ncheerful voice. \"And you will be late at home.\"\r\n\r\nDelia ran down and put on a clean cloth, and wiped the dishes over with\r\na dry towel, to take off the roughness Katy always left behind in her\r\nmanipulations. And she broiled the steak herself. She could do that to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nThen they arranged about the marriage. Delia certainly did need some\r\none. It was not worth while to make any fuss. Mrs. Whitney would surely\r\nbe back by Monday, and it was appointed for that evening.\r\n\r\nDolly took the news with cordial sweetness. Margaret was sorry that Ben\r\nhad not looked a little higher; but since it must be, they would make\r\nthe best of it. Hanny was delighted. Joe went down that very evening,\r\nand gave the young people his best love.\r\n\r\nMrs. Whitney came home on Saturday. She considered the step very\r\njudicious. She thought they had been engaged long enough. Then Ben and\r\nThe. were such good friends; and with The. away so much, it was\r\nlonesome. \"She was glad they had set the marriage for Monday evening,\r\nfor she had promised to go out to Buffalo on Tuesday with Mrs. Stafford.\r\nA nurse was the proper thing for Aunt Patty. It was too bad, to be sure;\r\nbut at her time of life, one might expect almost anything. And she, Mrs.\r\nWhitney, never had been any sort of a nurse; so it was folly for her to\r\nundertake it.\" She was very sweet to Aunt Patty. She had a good deal of\r\nthe suavity that helps matters to run easily, and her sympathies were\r\nboundless.\r\n\r\nDelia's sisters, and their children, and a few friends were invited. All\r\nthe Underhills came, and Hanny was bridesmaid; but she wore her last\r\nsummer's embroidered muslin, which was not long in the skirt.\r\n\r\nThey missed Ben a good deal, though he ran up every now and then. And\r\nTheodore was gone six weeks, instead of two or three. Now that Mrs.\r\nUnderhill had really \"given in,\" she was most cordial and sympathetic to\r\nher new daughter. Doctor Joe went down every day, though very little\r\ncould be done, since even a physician could not fight against old age.\r\nJoe thought Delia very sweet and patient.\r\n\r\nThere were two great undertakings engrossing the public mind. One was a\r\ngrand library. Old Mr. John Jacob Astor, some years previous, had left a\r\nlarge sum of money for this purpose; and there were heated discussions\r\nas to its scope and purpose. It would be a reference library rather than\r\nan entirely free library for general readers. But it would be a fine\r\naddition to the city.\r\n\r\nThe other was the Crystal Palace. There had been the first famous\r\nWorld's Fair at Sydenham, opened by the Prince Consort. And now, we were\r\ntrying our energy and ingenuity to have something worthy of attracting\r\nthe nations. Reservoir Square had been selected; and the great iron\r\nbraces and supports and ribs had been watched with curiously eager eyes,\r\nas they spread out into a giant framework, and were covered with glass\r\nthat glinted in the sun like molten gold. When its graceful dome arose,\r\nenthusiasm knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nWe had not dreamed of the great White City then. But we were only in the\r\nearly middle part of the century.\r\n\r\nA park had been opened on the east side, out of an old tract known as\r\n\"Jones's Woods,\" and was quite a picnic-place for the working-people on\r\na holiday. There was a talk about another, and, perhaps, the inspiration\r\nwas evolved as the Fair grounds were being put in attractive order. A\r\nshort time afterward, the Central Park board was appointed, with\r\nWashington Irving as president.\r\n\r\nThe country was wild and rough all about. Here and there, clusters of\r\nhouses began to indicate the coming city. Kip farm had not disappeared;\r\nand people talked of Strawberry Hill and Harlem Heights; and there\r\nremained some fortifications of the old Rock House of 1812 memory. The\r\nold times were recalled, as people went rambling around.\r\n\r\nBroadway still kept its vogue and elegance on the dollar side. There was\r\nThompson's and Taylor's, where the stylish young ladies stopped in the\r\nafternoon for chocolate or cream and confections, and theatre parties\r\nwent after the play. But, on the whole, there were mysterious strides\r\nup-town.\r\n\r\nThe old streets were quaint and cool in summer, with the trees that had\r\ngrown for years in ungrudged spaces. The park in Beach Street was still\r\nlovely; and now Hanny often went over from school and stayed to tea with\r\nBen and Delia. Daisy came down as well; and they talked of Nora, who was\r\ngetting on famously, and who had sung at an out-of-doors fête for a\r\nchildren's charity.\r\n\r\nDelia was happy and charming; but she was very much engrossed with home\r\naffairs. Nurses grew tired and went away; and Aunt Patty became more and\r\nmore helpless.\r\n\r\nThen came the great event to Hanny's life, and she was quite nervous\r\nover it. This was graduation; but when she had passed the examinations\r\nsuccessfully, the real care was over.\r\n\r\nAnd the new clothes! The old ones had been made to do through the\r\nspring; but now there was no question about long skirts. There were\r\npretty plaid summer-silks,--everybody wore them then, and they were\r\nalmost as cheap as now,--lawns, a light grey cashmere for ordinary\r\noccasions, and a white India muslin for graduation. The very next\r\nevening Dolly was to give her a party.\r\n\r\nGrandmother thought it ought to be at home, instead.\r\n\r\n\"She will want one in the fall,\" said Dolly, \"to announce that she is\r\nreally Miss Underhill, and ready for society. Home will be the place for\r\nthat. And she will be getting acquainted with young people through the\r\nsummer. She's never been anything but a little girl.\"\r\n\r\nThere wasn't such a fuss made about sweet girl graduates then; and,\r\nlater on, Rutgers Institute was to wheel into line and become a college;\r\nbut even now they had bouquets and baskets of flowers. And some of the\r\ngirls had lovers, and were engaged, even if there was no co-education.\r\nThe chapel was crowded with admiring friends; and the girls looked sweet\r\nand pretty in their white gowns and flowing curls; for youth has a charm\r\nand beauty of its own that does not depend on regular features, or\r\nstyle, or any of the later accessories of life. It is an enchanted land\r\nof sunny skies and heavenly atmospheres.\r\n\r\nShe came home out of it all with a curious new feeling. That night of\r\nthe banquet it had been almost a masquerade. Even now the blue shimmer\r\nand clouds of white ruffles seemed to belong to some other state. She\r\nwondered a little if she would ever wear it again.\r\n\r\nThere were some pretty gifts for her at home. Josie Dean and Charlie\r\nReed came around in the evening. He had passed his first year's\r\nexaminations successfully.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe and Jim and the elder people were talking very earnestly\r\nabout the duties and the purposes of life. Josie touched Hanny's hand,\r\nand, with a little movement, the sign girls understand, drew her out on\r\nthe porch.\r\n\r\n\"Let us walk down the path. Oh, Hanny, I've something to tell you!\" and\r\nher voice was in a sort of delicious tremble. \"May be you have\r\nsuspected. I told Charlie I _must_ confess it to you; though we do not\r\nmean to say much about it at present. Oh, Hanny, can't you guess?\"\r\n\r\nThere were so many things; it was something joyful, certainly. She\r\nglanced up and smiled. Josie's face was all one roseate flush.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" with a mysterious throb.\r\n\r\n\"We are engaged, dear. I don't know when we began to love each other. We\r\nhave been so much with each other, you know. He has helped me with my\r\nlessons; and we have sung, and played, and read, and gone to church\r\ntogether. It was like having a brother. Tudie and I used to envy you\r\nthe boys. And it was not quite like a brother either, for another\r\nfeeling came in. Sometimes I wanted to run away, such a queer tremble\r\ncame over me. Then there were hours when I could hardly wait for him to\r\ncome home from the seminary. And for a while, he was so grave, I\r\nwondered if I had offended him. And then--do you suppose any one can\r\ntell just _how_ it happens?--though they always do in books. All in an\r\ninstant, you know some one loves you. It's strange and beautiful and\r\nexciting; and it seems as if the best and loveliest of all the world had\r\ncome to you. We have been engaged a whole week; and every day it grows\r\nmore mysteriously delightful.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so strange,\" said Hanny, with a long, indrawn breath.\r\n\"And--Charlie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't you remember how we waylaid Mr. Reed one night, and begged\r\nhim to let Charlie go to singing-school? He laughed about it the other\r\nnight, though he said you were the bravest of the three. And he is\r\ndelighted with it. Then mother is so fond of Charles. Of course it will\r\nbe a two years' engagement. Mother doesn't want me to teach school now.\r\nShe thinks I ought to learn about housekeeping and sewing, and fit\r\nmyself for a minister's wife. That seems so solemn, doesn't it? Oh, I do\r\nwonder if I can be good enough! And visiting the poor, and helping to\r\nthe right way, and being patient and sweet, and real religious! But he\r\nwill help me; and he is so good! I think he couldn't have been anything\r\nbut a minister. I _do_ suppose Mrs. Reed knows about it in heaven. She\r\nwas so different that last year, sweeter and kinder; and we feel sure\r\nshe has gone to heaven. But we want her to know; and dear little Tudie!\r\nYou must come over and spend the day, now that school is ended; and we\r\nwill do nothing but talk about it. Oh, Hanny, I hope some day you will\r\nhave a lover! But you seem such a sort of a little girl even yet. And I\r\nhave worn long skirts a whole year.\"\r\n\r\nA lover! Hanny's face was scarlet in the fragrant dusk.\r\n\r\n\"We must go in. I promised mother we would not stay late. And Charlie\r\nhas some examinations for to-morrow. You may tell your mother and Daisy\r\nJasper.\"\r\n\r\nJoe said they needn't hurry off so; and Charles flushed as he looked at\r\nJosie. They rose and said good-night; and Josie kissed Hanny in a\r\nrapturous kind of fashion.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet a sixpence those two youngsters are engaged,\" said Jim.\r\n\"Hanny, what was all the long talk about?\"\r\n\r\nShe was not quite sure all the rest were to be taken in the confidence;\r\nbut she looked so conscious, and Jim was so positive, that she admitted\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\n\"That's just like a theological student.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a very suitable engagement. Mrs. Dean has brought Josie up\r\nsensibly; and Charles is such a fine fellow. Of course they must all be\r\npleased about it,\" commented Mrs. Underhill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nMISS NAN UNDERHILL\r\n\r\n\r\nJust a few days later, Mrs. Odell came down for some advice and help,\r\nfor Janey was to be married. Her betrothed was a well-to-do young farmer\r\nup in Sullivan County. He was coming down in August to go to the World's\r\nFair; and he wanted to be married and make a general holiday of it.\r\n\r\n\"I am not much judge of such matters; but Stephen's wife will go\r\nshopping with you. I don't know what we should do without her,\" said\r\nMrs. Underhill.\r\n\r\nThat very morning two silver-embossed envelopes came for Miss Nan\r\nUnderhill. One schoolmate was to be married in church at noon, and go to\r\nNiagara on a wedding journey. The other was an evening ceremony with a\r\nreception afterward. Mr. James Underhill had an invitation to this also.\r\n\r\nWas all the world getting married, or being engaged! Standing on the\r\nthreshold, Hanny shrank back in dismay. It was looking out of a tranquil\r\ncloister into a great, unknown world; and it gave her a mysterious\r\nshiver. She didn't feel safe and warm until she had dropped on her\r\nfather's knee, and had his strong, fond arms about her.\r\n\r\nDolly's party was a great success. The young people were invited to meet\r\nMiss Nan Underhill. And Miss Nan wore her graduation dress and blue\r\nribbons. Blue gave her a sort of ethereal look; pink added a kind of\r\nblossomy sweetness.\r\n\r\nDolly knew so many young folks. True, there were some older ones. Ben\r\nand Delia came up for an hour. Dolly said they were old-fashioned\r\nmarried people already. Hanny thought there didn't seem much difference,\r\nonly Ben had a new strange sort of sweetness. She was very fond of\r\nDelia; and it was a delight to feel free to go down to Beach Street.\r\n\r\nPeter and Paulus Beekman came; and they were nice, fine, rather stout\r\nyoung men. Peter was a lawyer; he and Jim were quite friends. Paulus was\r\nin shipping business.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Peter to Nan, \"you look just as you did when you were a\r\nlittle girl and used to come to grandfather's. Do you remember that\r\nbeautiful Angora cat? That was grandfather's sign. He always took to\r\npeople Katschina liked. And your hair hasn't grown any darker. I like\r\nlight hair. Aunt Dolly has such beautiful hair! And I'm glad you have\r\nnot grown up into a great, tall May-pole. I just adore little women.\r\nWhen I marry, I am going to choose a 'bonnie wee thing,' like the wife\r\nin the song.\"\r\n\r\nHanny flushed rosy red. Oh, why would people talk about being married,\r\nand all that? And if Peter wouldn't look at her in just that way! It\r\ngave her a touch of embarrassment.\r\n\r\nBut oh, they had a splendid time! Modern young people would have been\r\nbored, and voted it \"no spread at all.\" They played Proverbs, and What\r\nis my thought like? and everybody tried to bring out their very best,\r\nand be as bright and witty and joyous as possible. They had plain cake\r\nand fancy cake, and a new kind of dainty crisp crackers; candies, nuts,\r\nraisins, and mottoes, which were the greatest fun of all. Afterward,\r\nsome dancing with the Cheat quadrille, and it was so amusing to \"cut\r\nout,\" or run away and leave your partner with his open arms, and a blank\r\nlook of surprise on his face.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe came to take the little girl home; for he was quite sure Jim\r\nwould want to take some one else's sister.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Dolly,\" said Peter, when he was going away without any girl at\r\nall, though he had hoped to walk home with Hanny, \"isn't Nan Underhill\r\njust the sweetest little thing in the world? I don't wonder grandfather\r\nliked her so. With that soft, indescribable hair, and her\r\neyes,--twilight eyes, some one put in a poem,--and that cunning dimple\r\nwhen she smiles, and so dainty altogether. What made you say she was not\r\npretty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I said, she was not as handsome as Mrs. Hoffman.\"\r\n\r\n\"She suits me ten times better. She is like this,\r\n\r\n    \"'A creature not too bright or good\r\n    For human nature's daily food.'\"\r\n\r\nDolly repeated the talk and the verses to Stephen. \"And Peter is such a\r\nsolid, steady-going fellow. He was really smitten.\"\r\n\r\n\"The idea! And with that child!\"\r\n\r\nDolly laughed gaily. \"I suppose when our girls get to be eighteen, you\r\nwill still think them children. Why, I wasn't quite fifty when you fell\r\nin love with me!\"\r\n\r\nFifty! How ridiculous it was to think of Dolly ever being fifty. Ah, it\r\nis love alone that holds the secret of eternal youth!\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope there won't any one be foolish over Hanny, in a long\r\nwhile,\" said Stephen, decisively.\r\n\r\n\"Foolish!\" repeated Dolly, in a tone of resentment. But then they both\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nThe Odell girls came down to make a two days' visit. They went up to the\r\nDeans' to tea; and the two engaged girls strayed off by themselves, with\r\ntheir arms about each other, and had confidences in which the masculine\r\npronoun played an important part. And poor Polly bewailed the prospect\r\nof being left alone. If she had a brother like Jim, she wouldn't mind.\r\n\r\nJim's girls were a kind of standing amusement to the family. This was a\r\ncase where there was safety in numbers, Mrs. Underhill felt assured. If\r\nshe had known of the episode of Lily Ludlow, her confidence would have\r\nbeen a little shaken. Jim was a general lover of the sex, and a\r\ngood-looking, entertaining young fellow is apt to be spoiled.\r\n\r\nJust now he had a penchant for Daisy, who teased him, and was as\r\nuncertain as an April shower. She and Hanny were inseparables. Jim took\r\nthem round to Dolly's, or down to Ben's, or to Mrs. Hoffman, who had a\r\nnew grand piano, and had refurnished her parlor, quite changing the\r\nsimplicity of her first wedded life. Through the winter, she had given\r\nfortnightly receptions, that had an air and grace of the highest\r\nrefinement. You always met some of the best and the most entertaining\r\npeople. It was not a crush and a jam; but men and women really talked at\r\nthat period, and brought out their best. Knowledge was not at a\r\ndiscount.\r\n\r\nYoung ladies came to call on Miss Underhill; and in the evenings, they\r\nbrought their brothers or admirers. When she knew of it beforehand, she\r\nalways had Daisy to help. Sometimes the whole party would go out for a\r\nlittle walk, and have some cream or water ices. The city was still so\r\nairy and open, you did not have to fly out of it at the first pleasant\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis summer, nearly everybody was staying at home, and waiting for the\r\nbig fair to open. Rooms at hotels and private houses were engaged; and\r\nthe plainer country people came in to visit. There would be crowds, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe Underhills had invited some of the elder relatives, since they had\r\nplenty of room.\r\n\r\nAnd on July 4th, this great event occurred. The President, Mr. Franklin\r\nPierce at that time, was the grand master of the occasion. Oh, what a\r\nFourth of July it was! The grounds were crowded. The military were out\r\nin force; and the fireworks would have done credit to the empire of\r\nChina. Never had the city seen such a gala time; the Victory of Peace it\r\nwas called.\r\n\r\nThe men had it largely to themselves this day. It was more the\r\nceremonies, than the articles exhibited, that attracted attention. That\r\ncame later on.\r\n\r\nThere was a great influx of visitors in the city. The streets were\r\nthronged; the stages were crowded. One wonders what they did without\r\nelectric cars. But numbers of people still kept carriages, and temporary\r\nlodging-houses were erected in the vicinity of the Palace. It certainly\r\nwas a great thing for that day. And the interior, with its handsome\r\ndome, its galleries, its arched naves, and broad aisles, had a striking\r\nand splendid effect.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, the riches of the world that had contributed some of its\r\nchoicest treasures! There were many people who never expected to go to\r\nEurope, and who were glad beyond measure to have it come to them. Here\r\nwas the largest collection of paintings and sculpture that had ever been\r\ngathered in New York. Then, for the first time, we saw Powers' matchless\r\nGreek slave, and Kiss' Amazon, and many another famous marble. There was\r\nthe row of the Apostles by the sculptor Thorwaldsen, about which there\r\nwas always a concourse of people; and some of the devout could almost\r\nsee them in the flesh.\r\n\r\nWe have had a Centennial since, and a famous White City, and almost any\r\nday, in New York, you can see some famous pictures and statuary. Then\r\npeople run over to Europe, and study up the galleries, and write books\r\nof exquisite descriptions; but it was not so at that time. There is the\r\ngrand Museum of Art near to where the old Palace stood; but all was new\r\nthen. We had not been surfeited with beauty; we had not had a flood of\r\nart critics, praising or denouncing, and schools of this or that fad. It\r\nis good for cities, as well as nations, that they should once be young,\r\nand revel in the enchanting sense of freshness and delight.\r\n\r\nPresently, it became a sort of regular thing to go,--a kind of\r\nsummer-day excursion. There were delightful walks and drives up above.\r\nBloomingdale was still a garden of sweetness. Riverside was unknown,\r\nonly as the beautiful bank of the Hudson. You went and carried your\r\nlunch, or you found some simple cottage, where a country-woman dispensed\r\ntruly home-made bread, and delicious ham, and a glass of milk,\r\nbuttermilk on some days.\r\n\r\nThe remembrance of it to Hanny Underhill, through all her after years,\r\nwas as of a golden summer. The little knot of young people kept\r\ntogether. When Josie Dean recovered somewhat, from the first transports\r\nof her engagement, she proved very companionable. Charles, in his long\r\nvacation, was quite at their service. Jim couldn't always be at liberty;\r\nbut he did get off pretty often. Sometimes Joe, sometimes Father\r\nUnderhill, chaperoned the party; but they were allowed to go by\r\nthemselves as well. Girl friends joined them; Peter Beekman, and even\r\nPaulus, thought it a great thing to be counted in.\r\n\r\nOh, the wonderful articles! It was a liberal education. Sèvres china,\r\nWorcestershire with its wonderful tint, Wedgwood, Doulton, Cloisonnée,\r\nsome rare Italian; and the tragic stories of Palissy, of Josiah\r\nWedgwood, and Charles III. of Naples taking his secret to Spain; some\r\nqueer Chinese ware, and Delft and Dresden, until it seemed as if half\r\nthe genius of the world must have been expended in the exquisite\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nAnd then the laces, the gossamer fabrics, the silks and velvets, the\r\njewels, the elegant things from barbaric Russia, the wonders of the\r\nOrient, the plainer exhibit of our own land rich in mechanical wonders,\r\nthe natural products, the sewing-machine that now could do the finest of\r\nwork, the miniature looms weaving, the queer South American and Mexican\r\nfabrications, the gold from California,--well, it seemed as if one never\r\ncould see it all.\r\n\r\nHanny wondered why Peter Beekman should want to stay close by her when\r\nDaisy was so bright and entertaining, and when there were other girls.\r\nWhen he looked at her so earnestly her heart gave a great throb, her\r\ncheeks burned, and she wanted to run away.\r\n\r\nHe wished she wasn't so shy and so ready to shelter herself under\r\nCharlie's wing, or her father's, or Joe's. And when she felt really safe\r\nshe was so merry and enchanting!\r\n\r\nIt was a day in August, rather warm, to be sure; but Polly Odell had\r\ncome down just on purpose to go, \"for now that Janey was married and\r\ngone the house was too horrid lonesome!\" They stopped for Josie. Doctor\r\nJoe brought Daisy up in the afternoon, and they were all in the\r\npicture-gallery, where they were ever finding something new. Perhaps\r\nPolly had made big eyes at Peter; perhaps Peter liked her because she\r\ntalked so much about Hanny. Anyhow, they had rambled off way at one end.\r\nDaisy was resting, and telling the doctor about some pictures in the\r\nBerlin gallery. Hanny moved up and down slowly, not getting very far\r\naway. She was fond of interiors, and the homely Dutch or French women\r\ncooking supper, or tending a baby, or spinning. And there were two\r\nkittens she had never seen before, scampering about an old kitchen where\r\na man in his shirt-sleeves had fallen asleep over his paper. It seemed\r\nto her she could see them move.\r\n\r\nA man of six or seven and twenty, young for his years, yet with a\r\ncertain stamp of the world and experience, went slowly along, glancing\r\nat the visitors in a casual manner. Of course he would know Miss Jasper\r\nand Dr. Underhill. It was like looking for a needle in a hay-stack; but\r\nMrs. Jasper had suggested the picture-gallery; and suddenly he saw a\r\nsmall figure and fair face under a big leghorn hat full of wild roses\r\nand green leaves. She was smiling at the playful kittens. Oh, it surely\r\nwas Miss Nan Underhill!\r\n\r\nHe came nearer; and she looked startled, as if she might fly. What a\r\ndelicious colour drenched her face!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you surely haven't forgotten me!\" he cried. \"I should remember you\r\nthousands of years, and I could pick you out of a world full of women.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--\" Then she gave her soft little laugh, and the colour went\r\nfluttering all over her face in a startled, happy manner. \"But I\r\nthought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you think me a fixture in German wilds? Well, I am not. It's a\r\nlong, long story; but I have come over now for good, to be a true\r\nAmerican citizen all the rest of my days. The steamer arrived last\r\nnight; but I couldn't get off until nearly noon. Then I went to a hotel\r\nand had some dinner, and came up to see Mrs. Jasper. She sent me here.\r\nWhere are the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Daisy is--\" she glanced about--\"oh, down there with my brother,--and\r\nMiss Odell\"--how queer that sounded!\r\n\r\n\"Let us stop here and rest until I get my breath and summon enough\r\nfortitude to encounter them. You are dreadfully surprised, I see by your\r\nface, I don't wonder. I must seem to you dropped from the clouds.\"\r\n\r\nShe wasn't a bit afraid, and sat down beside him. And she wondered if he\r\nhad married the German cousin and brought her over; but it was strange\r\nnot to mention her. It must be, however, if he was going to live in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you remember that night and the Spanish dance? I have shut my\r\neyes and danced it ever so many times in memory. And you sent me\r\naway,\"--with a soft, untranslatable laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I--\" She looked amazed. She seemed caught and held captive in the swirl\r\nof some strange power. The colour fluttered up and down her sweet face,\r\nand her eyelids drooped, their long, soft lashes making shadows.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you said I ought to go; and I shall always be glad I went,\"--in a\r\nconfident tone.\r\n\r\n\"Your cousin?\" she said inquiringly, with no consciousness that a word\r\nwould swerve either way.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You know I told you my father's wishes. That sort of thing doesn't\r\nseem queer to continental people. But it was not so much his as the\r\naunt's,--the relation is farther back than that; but it serves the same\r\npurpose. She had known about my father, and was desirous of being\r\nfriends. So after I was home about a week, and had confessed to my\r\nfather that the prospect of the marriage was not agreeable to me, he\r\nstill begged me to go.\"\r\n\r\nHanny looked almost as if she was disappointed. He smiled and resumed:--\r\n\r\n\"It is a lonely spot on the Rhine, not far from Ebberfeld. We will look\r\nit up some day. I don't know how people can spend their lives in such\r\ndreary places. I do not wonder my grandmother ran away with her brave\r\nlover. The castle is fast going to ruins. There was a brother who wasted\r\na great deal of the patrimony before he died. The Baroness is the last\r\nof her race. There is a poor little village at the foot of the mountain,\r\nand some peasants who work the land; and then the cousin, who is\r\nexpected to rehabilitate the race by marrying a rich man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" There was such a pretty, eager interest and pity in her eyes that\r\nhe smiled.\r\n\r\n\"She is six and twenty; tall, fair, with a sorrowful kind of face, that\r\nhas never been actually happy or pretty. Who could be happy in that\r\nmusty old rookery! The father, I believe, did very little for their\r\npleasure, but spent most of his time in town, wasting their little\r\nsubstance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, poor girl!\" cried Hanny, thinking of her own father, so loving and\r\ngenerous.\r\n\r\n\"She seemed to me almost as old as her mother. And then she told me her\r\ntroubles, poor thing, and I found her in heart and mind a sort of\r\ninexperienced child. She has had a lover for two years; an enterprising\r\nyoung man, who is superintendent of an iron mine some fifty miles\r\ndistant. It is the old story over again. I wish he had my grandfather's\r\ncourage and would run away with her. He has no title nor aristocratic\r\nblood, and the mother will not consent. But I had made up my mind before\r\nI went there, and even if I had been fancy free, I couldn't resign\r\nmyself to live in that old ruin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what will she do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I advised her to run away.\" Herman Andersen laughed softly. \"But I\r\nthink I persuaded them both to come to the city and visit my father.\r\nThey will find business isn't so shocking. They have lived in loneliness\r\nuntil they know very little of the real world. The old castle is not\r\nworth saving. Then I went home, and after a good deal of talking have\r\narranged my life in a way that is satisfactory to my father, and I hope\r\nwill be eminently so to myself. Some day I will tell you about that. Now\r\nwhere shall we find the others?\" and he rose.\r\n\r\n\"Daisy is down here.\" Hanny rose also; but she had a queer sort of\r\nfeeling, as if the world was turning round.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Doctor Joe that he so rarely had a good talk with Daisy\r\nnow, that he would make the most of this opportunity. Jim was always\r\nhovering about her. It was natural she should like the younger people.\r\nHe was like a very much older brother. She was looking pale and tired.\r\nShe could not stand continual dissipation. And while she often had a\r\nbrilliant color and Hanny very little, the latter possessed by far the\r\nmost endurance.\r\n\r\nShe liked to be alone with Doctor Joe. There was something restful and\r\ninspiriting, as if she absorbed his generous, superabundant strength.\r\n\r\nSo they almost forgot about Hanny, or thought her with the others. And\r\nnow she came walking slowly down to them with a strange young man.\r\n\r\n\"Why, who can it be?\" in a tone of surprised inquiry.\r\n\r\nDaisy Jasper studied a moment. \"Why, it looks like--no, it cannot\r\nbe--yes, it is Mr. Andersen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nDaisy looked puzzled. Then she sprang up with a quick colour and a smile\r\nof pleasure, stretching out both hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Miss Jasper!\" and Mr. Andersen took her hands in a fervent clasp.\r\n\"Do you know this is going to be a red-letter day in my life,--one of\r\nthe happiest of days? Your mother sent me up here on a venture. First, I\r\nfound Miss Underhill, and now you. And one might go all over the world\r\nand miss one's best friends. Ah, Dr. Underhill!\"\r\n\r\nA curious shock went over Dr. Underhill. He had to compel himself to\r\ntake the outstretched hand. For what had this young man \"crossed the\r\nseas?\" He was not going to marry the cousin.\r\n\r\n\"But when did you come?\" inquired Daisy. It was odd, but he took the\r\nseat the other side of her, and Hanny was by Joe.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Andersen told his voyage all over again, and that he had come\r\nfor good. He was to take his father's money share in the house here, and\r\nhis father's was to be transferred to Paris, where one of the elderly\r\npartners was in failing health and wished to retire.\r\n\r\n\"I am just delighted,\" exclaimed Daisy, enthusiastically. \"If you would\r\nonly come and board at our house! There are some people going away.\r\nWouldn't it be splendid, Hanny?\"\r\n\r\nHanny assented with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I will see if I can find the others,\" said the doctor, rising and\r\nlooking at his watch. \"Father was to drive up with the Surrey at\r\nhalf-past five. Don't go away from here.\"\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly, looking a few moments in every room. Yes--there was\r\nCharles. He caught his eye and beckoned.\r\n\r\nThe estrays soon rejoined the others. Then they went out to the\r\nsouthern entrance, and so along to the gateway.\r\n\r\nYes, there was Mr. Underhill. He would take the four girls, and one\r\nmore, as he had a team. This was decided to be Mr. Andersen, as he was\r\nto go to the Jaspers' to tea. The others would ride down in the stage.\r\nThe doctor said he must make a few calls. Mr. Beekman expressed his\r\nintention of coming up in the evening, as Miss Odell was going to stay;\r\nand Miss Odell's eyes shone with delight.\r\n\r\nDaisy having a lover! Dr. Underhill had not felt alarmed about Jim's\r\nattentions, he had so many fancies. But this young man--\r\n\r\nWould it be best or wise for Daisy to marry? She appeared quite well,\r\nbut she was not strong, and there was a remnant of the old spinal\r\ntrouble that came out now and then in excruciating nervous headaches.\r\nSomehow she had seemed his especial property since she had cried in his\r\narms with all the pain and suffering, and he had encouraged her to bear\r\nthe little more. He had meant always to stand her friend. It wasn't\r\nlikely he would marry, for he had seen no one yet that he wanted. But if\r\nthis child went out of his life! For, alas! the child had grown to\r\nwomanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE OLD, OLD STORY, EVER NEW\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Underhill took Polly home the next day, it was with the\r\nstipulation that she should come back and spend a week. Polly was wild\r\nwith delight, and packed up her best things. There were some other\r\nvisitors,--cousins of the elderly sort,--so the young people had their\r\nown good times. Daisy and Mr. Andersen were in, and Charlie and they had\r\nthe happy enjoyment of youth.\r\n\r\nPeter Beekman seemed devoted to them. Jim wouldn't be crowded out where\r\nDaisy was concerned, but he wanted to be first with her. Mr. Andersen\r\ngave way generously, and went over to Hanny, who somehow clung to Polly.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of business to be done for Mr. Herman Andersen.\r\nHis father's share in the New York firm was to be transferred to him, as\r\nat the age of twenty-five he had come into possession of his mother's\r\nfortune, that had been accumulating. His father was to take charge of\r\nthe Paris house. He spent some hours every morning with Mr. Jasper,\r\nacquiring a knowledge of his new duties; but the afternoons were for\r\npleasure, until the autumnal business stirred up.\r\n\r\n\"I do wish young Beekman wouldn't come over here so much,\" Mrs.\r\nUnderhill said in a fretted tone, \"or that he would take a real fancy to\r\nPolly.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are just having a young people's good time,\" returned Joe.\r\n\"Polly's a nice girl. He might do worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am afraid it is not Polly. He watches Hanny like a cat watching a\r\nmouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" declared Joe.\r\n\r\n\"But he does. And I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother dear, you're a hen with one chick. If there is a rustle in\r\nthe leaves you think a hawk is going to pounce down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanny's too young to have lovers.\" She tried to keep her face in severe\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n\"Hanny isn't thinking about lovers. And Peter is a fine, solid fellow,\r\nwho is going to make his mark, and who may be a sort of ballast to Jim.\r\nI like him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is well enough. But if there was any fuss it might annoy Dolly.\r\nAnd we have always been so cordial; Margaret was married too young.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were married too young. Now, if you had waited and done without\r\nSteve and me, and begun with John--\"\r\n\r\nThere was a twinkle in Doctor Joe's eye.\r\n\r\n\"I should have begun with the most sensible son,\" returned his mother;\r\nbut she could not keep her voice sharp.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will look after Hanny and the young man. I think myself that we\r\ndon't need any more lovers right away.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew she could depend on him.\r\n\r\nThen they had some anxiety at Ben's, and Delia's mother was away. Aunt\r\nBoudinot had her third stroke, and lay insensible for several days, then\r\nslipped out of life. Mrs. Underhill was quite surprised with Delia's\r\ngood sense, as she called it, and really she wasn't such a bad\r\nhousekeeper for a girl with no training.\r\n\r\nThere was the funeral, with some of New York's oldest families.\r\nAfterward the will was read. Aunt Patty had made a new one on the death\r\nof her sister.\r\n\r\nThere was a small legacy to the niece who had married; a remembrance to\r\nseveral relatives and friends. The use of the house was to be Mrs.\r\nWhitney's while she lived; at her death to be sold and divided between\r\nher niece, Delia Whitney, and her grand-niece, Eleanora Whitney. And to\r\nDelia Whitney, if she took faithful care of her until her death, the sum\r\nof five thousand dollars in bank-stock.\r\n\r\nShe had taken faithful care of her, and would have done it out of the\r\nkindness of her heart without any reward.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it might be a thousand dollars,\" she said to Ben, \"and I made\r\nup my mind if it should be that, we would take it and go abroad. I had\r\nsome savings beside. When Bayard Taylor told us about his tour I felt\r\nsure we could do something like it. We would keep out of the expensive\r\ntourists' ways, and live cheaply, keeping house when we could. Oh, Ben,\r\nwon't it be splendid!\"\r\n\r\nHe thought it splendid to have her so generous, but he had some savings\r\nas well.\r\n\r\nFive thousand dollars was considered quite a legacy in those days; and\r\nthe bank-stock was worth a good deal more than its face.\r\n\r\nEvery one said they would be crazy to waste their money in such a\r\nfrivolous manner.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind if I shouldn't ever be rich,\" declared Ben. \"I want a\r\npiece of the big world, with its knowledges and wonders. I shouldn't\r\ncare to live there always, but it broadens one to see what other nations\r\nhave done; what has made their greatness and what has contributed to\r\ntheir downfall. And the arts and sciences, the mysteries of the East and\r\nof Egypt. We are young yet as a country, and we have a right to gather\r\nup the riches of experience. I only hope we shall profit by it.\"\r\n\r\nSo they planned and planned. Delia looked over the old things, and sent\r\nDolly and Hanny some antiquities of a century or more. Then she packed\r\nand boxed hers, for she knew her mother might deal them out to\r\nindifferent people. She thought it would be a good plan to hire out the\r\nhouse to some one who would board her mother and Theodore; and presently\r\none of the married sisters, Mrs. Ferris, decided she would come. So then\r\nthey could plan to go away; and Delia might write her novel while she\r\nwas abroad.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the summer was slipping away like a dream. The great fair\r\nstill attracted a large concourse. But September came in, and schools\r\nopened. Jim went back to regular study; Charles to the seminary. Hanny\r\nhad some more schoolmates married. There was another baby at Margaret's;\r\nand it was so delightful to go down to Delia's and hear all the plans!\r\nNow that Hanny had learned so much at the Crystal Palace, she had quite\r\na longing for churches and museums and art galleries. Herman Andersen\r\nhad visited so many of them!\r\n\r\nSometimes Daisy Jasper went down with her. Mr. Andersen came for them in\r\nthe evening. Delia he thought wonderfully bright and entertaining. Ben\r\nliked him amazingly.\r\n\r\n\"But if I had all that money,\" said Ben, \"I wouldn't confine myself to\r\nsuch puttering stuff as silks and laces and India shawls; I should want\r\nto do something high up and fine, like a magazine or a paper, that had\r\ninfluence and scope. Some day I mean to own a share in a paper, where\r\nyou have a chance to touch up public opinion.\"\r\n\r\nHerman Andersen seemed very happy and content. Mr. Jasper said he was\r\ngoing to make a fine, reliable business man. He really felt he wouldn't\r\nobject to him for a son.\r\n\r\nGrandmother Van Kortlandt was growing more feeble, and now and then had\r\na bad spell. Doctor Joe made light of it, and told her red lavender and\r\naromatic hartshorn were good for old ladies. She seemed to want her\r\ndaughter near her. The young man who had alarmed Mrs. Underhill did not\r\ncome so frequently, so she began to feel quite safe.\r\n\r\nOh, what a happy, happy summer it had been! The little girl was used to\r\nher long frocks, and studied ways of doing her hair, and practised\r\nMendelssohn's \"Songs without Words\" because some one had said they were\r\nthe most beautiful things he had ever heard. She and Daisy and Mr.\r\nAndersen talked German, and had no end of fun.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Mr. Andersen came in.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go up to the Crystal Palace,\" he said. \"It is the most glorious\r\nafternoon imaginable. There is a sort of hazy red gold in the air, that\r\nexhilarates one. You feel as if you could soar to heaven's gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't been up in almost a fortnight,\" said Hanny, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The more need of our going now. I enjoy these superb days to the full.\"\r\n\r\nHanny went to get her hat. Grandmother generally took her nap early in\r\nthe afternoon. Mother was not in her own room, she saw, as she looked\r\nin, so she ran on down. She was not in the kitchen either.\r\n\r\n\"Joe,\" she cried--there was no one in the office, and he sat with his\r\nlegs stretched out, and a book on the table beside him, looking very\r\ncomfortable,--\"Joe, where is mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up with grandmother, dear. Don't disturb her. What did you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing--only to say--we are going up to the fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; run along. You look as sweet as a pink.\"\r\n\r\nA bright color flashed over her face, and settled in her dimple, making\r\nit look like a rose as she smiled.\r\n\r\nShe was putting on her blossom-coloured lace mitts as she entered the\r\nroom. Some one else thought she looked as sweet as a pink when he rose,\r\nand led the way.\r\n\r\nShe turned down the street.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Daisy is not going,\" he said. \"She had a headache all the morning.\r\nYou don't mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. Poor dear Daisy! And I didn't go in!\" Her voice was touched\r\nwith the sweetest regret and compassion.\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe went upstairs presently, to grandmother.\r\n\r\n\"Her breathing is better,\" he said. \"I have tried a new remedy. When she\r\nhas had some sleep she will be all right. This isn't quite a normal\r\nstate yet. Call me if there is any special change.\"\r\n\r\nThen he went down to the office again. People came more in the morning\r\nor the evening, and he had attended to his urgent calls. He was glad not\r\nto go out just then. But he thought of the young people on their way to\r\nthe palace of delight. Had he ever been young and joyous, as the youth\r\nof to-day? He had studied and worked, taught some, used up all his time,\r\nand had none for the passing vagaries. What made him feel old, and as if\r\nsome of the rarest delights would pass him by?\r\n\r\nThere was a light tap at the office-door, though it stood ajar. He rose\r\nand opened it wider.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Daisy Jasper!\" he cried in amazement. \"Or is it your wraith? I\r\nthought you had gone to the fair with Hanny.\"\r\n\r\nShe had been very pale; now she flushed a little. There was a\r\ntremulousness about her, and shadows under her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I had a headache all the morning; most of the night as well. It has\r\ngone off somewhat, but I didn't feel well enough for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not.\" He led her to the pretty library, that was always\r\nhaving a picture or a set of books added. You couldn't put in any more\r\neasy-chairs. He placed her in one. As he touched her hand, he felt the\r\nfeverish tremble.\r\n\r\n\"My dear child, what is it?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes drooped, and tears beaded the lashes.\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't have come out. Why did you not send for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I wanted to come. I knew Hanny would be gone. I wanted to see you.\"\r\nShe was strangely embarrassed.\r\n\r\nHe was standing by the side of the chair and took her hand again. How\r\nlimp and lifeless it seemed!\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to see you--to ask you, to tell you--oh, how shall I say\r\nit!--if you could help me a little. You are so wise, and can think of so\r\nmany ways--and I am so afraid he loves me--it would not be right--\"\r\n\r\nYes, that was it. This bright, charming, well-bred, fortunate young\r\nfellow loved her. He could keep her like a little queen. And she had\r\nsome conscientious scruple about her health, and her trifling lameness,\r\nand all. A word from him would keep her where she was. He had carried\r\nher in his arms, his little ewe lamb. No man could ever give her the\r\nexquisite care that he would be able to bestow. Oh, could he let any one\r\ntake her out of his life!\r\n\r\nYet some one younger and richer loved her. Yes, he _must_ stand aside.\r\n\r\n\"My child,\"--he would be grave and fatherly,--\"I think you are making\r\nyourself needless trouble. Why should you refuse a good man's love? You\r\nhave your beauty, and a gift that is really a genius, and though you may\r\nnot be as strong as some women, that is no reason why you should deny\r\nyourself the choicest blessing of a woman's life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But\"--she gave a little sob--\"I thought you might blame me for being\r\nheedless. We have all been such friends. And I don't want anything to\r\nmar the perfect pleasantness. I know it is not right because--how can I\r\nmake you understand! It might wound you if I said it--I think it can\r\nnever be that kind of love--\"\r\n\r\nDid he hear aright, or was it some subtle temptation?\r\n\r\n\"You, of all other women, should be careful not to make a mistake. It\r\nwould mean more to you afterward--if matters went a little wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he is so gay, so full of life and fun, and always wanting one to\r\nkeep up to the highest pitch. It would not be the right thing for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is very gentle as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Underhill, tell me that it isn't the right step for me to take,\r\n_ever_,\" Daisy said decisively.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell you any such thing. I will not bar you out of any\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps he really approved of it. They were all in a way proud of the\r\nyounger brother. And Jim thought there was no such splendid man in the\r\nworld as the doctor. Oh, if she only knew! She was heroic enough to\r\nplease them all for the sake of the past and present friendship. But she\r\nhad a doubt of Mrs. Underhill's approval. She might give in as she had\r\nto Delia; and now she had really begun to find virtues in Ben's wife.\r\nBut with Jim's brilliant nature always on the alert for amusement, she,\r\nDaisy, would be worn out trying to keep up to his standard.\r\n\r\nShe rose slowly. \"I ought not have come,\" she began in a despondent\r\ntone. \"I thought I could talk it all over with you; but I must decide,\r\nand bear the pain. You may all feel hurt, even if you acknowledge the\r\nwisdom of my decision. It would be a delight to come and live with you\r\nall; I who have had no brothers or sisters. But I think Jim will soon\r\nget over it, especially if _you_ point out the unwisdom of it all. Maybe\r\nyou will take me back into favour then, when the soreness is spent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jim,\" he repeated, in a vague, absent sort of way. \"Jim! Who are you\r\ntalking about, Daisy?\"\r\n\r\nHer face was scarlet, and her eyes full of tears.\r\n\r\n\"Your brother James. It is a shame, I know, to betray one man's inmost\r\nsecrets to another. But I am quite sure that I ought not, that I cannot,\r\nmarry him. Oh, will you all forgive me, and help him to forget all but\r\nthe friendship?\"\r\n\r\nShe took a step toward the door. The scarlet went out of her face, and\r\nshe swayed as if her strength was all gone. He caught her, and put her\r\nback in the chair.\r\n\r\n\"Jim!\" now in a tone of great surprise, and giving a little incredulous\r\nlaugh. \"Why, I thought it was Herman Andersen.\"\r\n\r\nJoe's heart seemed suddenly to enlarge and fill his whole body. There\r\nwas a ringing in his ears, as of joy-bells.\r\n\r\n\"Herman Andersen!\" she said composedly. \"Oh, have you all been blind?\r\nWhy, he is in love with Hanny! He came back to America to win her, and\r\nhe will if he serves seven years.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Joe looked at her in amaze. Ah, yes, they had been blind. They\r\nhad fenced out young Peter Beckman, and opened the door wide to this\r\nunsuspected lover. And he knew as well as it Hanny had confessed it,\r\nthat her heart had gone to meet his on the magic sea of love, and they\r\nwould come into port no longer twain, but one.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the broad arm of the chair. He could see Daisy's long\r\nagitated breaths quiver through her body; and she looked tired and\r\nspent. Poor little girl!\r\n\r\n\"No, I had never thought of Jim,\" he began gravely, \"because he is so\r\nfond of girls; a general worshipper. Not but what he might be very true\r\nand devoted to one. He seems so young yet. Daisy,\"--his voice\r\nfell,--\"did he ask you--\"\r\n\r\nHer head drooped a little, and her shining curls hid her face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do believe that when I thought of it first I did try to evade,\r\nto--to laugh him out of it. That was a month ago. He kept saying little\r\nthings I would not heed or seem to understand. It has been such a gay,\r\nhappy summer for us all! And there was Charlie's engagement. Last\r\nevening mamma and papa had gone out to call on a friend, and we were\r\nquite alone--\"\r\n\r\nHow much was volatile temperament and the love of pursuit, and how much\r\nthe deeper regard? Let him do his young brother justice.\r\n\r\n\"Charlie is young, to be sure, but he is a very steady-minded fellow,\r\nand his mother's and Tudie's death brought them together in a very\r\nsympathetic manner. Then Charles is about certain of a good position.\r\nJim has his fortune all to make. And you are right about some other\r\nqualities. Herman Andersen would be a much better companion for you. Jim\r\nis strong and energetic, full of life, and will always be among the busy\r\nbustling things, and deep in excitements. He would wear you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't you see that when he is five or six and twenty he will need\r\nsomething better than an invalid wife, who might have to go to bed with\r\na headache when he was giving an important dinner, or having a brilliant\r\nsort of evening with some stylish guests? He ought to have a wife\r\nsomething like Mrs. Hoffman, who would help him to the finest things of\r\nlife. And though I seem well, I shall never be real strong; and I do not\r\ncare for grand society. I like a good deal of quiet and ease, and just\r\neveryday living, a little painting when I feel inspired, a little\r\nreading and talks with friends, and old-fashioned music. I sometimes\r\nfeel as if I was an old girl, and ought to have lived a century ago.\r\nPerhaps I shall make a queer, stuffy old woman. And--I ought not to\r\nmarry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not give up the divine right,\" he made answer, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have a pretty face just now, and people, I find, _do_ admire\r\nbeauty. But that will fade.\" Then she sprang up suddenly, parted her\r\nlong ringlets, and stood with her back to him. \"See,\" and her voice\r\ntrembled, he knew there were tears in her eyes, \"I have a little crook\r\nin my back, and one high shoulder. There has to be half an inch of cork\r\nin one boot-sole to keep me straight and from limping. No, I shouldn't\r\ndo for a handsome young man like Jim, for I may grow lamer and crookeder\r\nas I grow older; nor for any man, although you try to comfort me with an\r\nalmost divine compassion.\"\r\n\r\nShe was sobbing in his arms then. It was not the first time she had wept\r\nout her sorrow there.\r\n\r\nHe raised the golden head a little, and kissed down amid the passionate\r\ntears that were sweeping away a kind of regret that sometimes haunted\r\nher. He had kissed her often as a little child, but rarely since her\r\nreturn from abroad. Her girlhood had been a quality fine and rare and\r\nsacred to him.\r\n\r\n\"Except the one man who has always loved you from the poor little child\r\nin her pitiful pain and anguish, and the little girl who began to take\r\ncourage and face the world, the larger girl who was brave and\r\nsunny-hearted, and looked out with hopeful eyes on the world that had so\r\nmany blessings. And he knows now that no skill can ever shut out all\r\nsuffering; but his sympathy and tender affection will help her through\r\nyears that may be weary and sorrowful, and endure with her whatever\r\nburden comes, make her pathway easy and pleasant and restful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you must not,\" she cried, with a pang of renunciation. \"Whatever\r\napplies to another man applies with double force to you. You are so\r\nnoble, so tender; so worthy of what is best in life! And you have to\r\ncarry so many burdens for other people that you must have some one brave\r\nand strong and full of energy and in perfect health--\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman I love will be better than all this to me,\" he returned, with\r\na sweetness in his voice that went to her very heart, and brought the\r\ntears to her eyes again. Then he dropped down in the great chair and\r\ntook her gently in his arms, and he knew his case was as good as won.\r\n\r\n\"When you were a little girl you once said to Hanny if you could have a\r\nbrother out of the clan you would like it to be me. And for days the\r\nquaint, generous little soul could hardly resolve whether it was not her\r\nduty to give me away. Then don't you remember you both planned to come\r\nand keep my bachelor-home? Some one else will take her. And we will\r\nwait, dear. We will go on in the same friendly, kindly fashion. You must\r\nrun in and out and come to me with your headaches and perplexities, and\r\nI shall scold you a little and give you a bitter tonic; and when\r\neverything is just right I shall ask you to marry me; but all the time I\r\nshall be loving you so much that it will be impossible for you to refuse\r\nme. So you know what is in store, and no one need trouble about the\r\nfuture. You are not engaged, you are quite free; and, like Ben, I will\r\nwait seven years or twenty years for you. But I think you never can\r\nbelong to any one else.\"\r\n\r\nAh, what delightful security!\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear Doctor Joe. Oh, it would be too much happiness! No, I ought\r\nnot; mamma thinks I ought not to marry. And,\" raising her head and\r\nshowing a face full of scarlet flushes and tears, and eyes shining with\r\nlove's own light, \"it looks just as if I had come in here and really\r\nasked you to marry me. We have forgotten all about poor Jim. You will\r\nthink me a coquette, and you ought to despise me.\"\r\n\r\nHis clasp tightened a little.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that Jim should have been so heedless. Perhaps it will be\r\nbetter to let him learn how much in earnest you are with your refusal.\r\nIt may not be flattering to a young girl to think a man will forget\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want him to forget that part,\" she interrupted eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I think he will. And if he comes to me for comfort, I will try to be a\r\nwise father-confessor. And yet I can't help pitying the man a little who\r\nwill lose you. Only in this case it would be like having an exotic\r\nwithout a conservatory, and not quite knowing how to build one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Joseph!\" his mother called from upstairs.\r\n\r\nDaisy sprang up and smoothed her ruffled plumes, Joe gave her one long,\r\ndear kiss, and she flashed out of the little room.\r\n\r\nShe held her head very high. It was the most splendid thing that could\r\nhappen to a girl; but she was not going to spoil her dear Doctor Joe's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAre there days that the Lord of all the earth has created for love? Some\r\ndays seem made especially for sorrow. But this had such an exquisite\r\nserenity brooding in the air. It was not late enough to have any regrets\r\nfor the passing of summer, and oh, what a summer it had been!\r\n\r\n\"Do you really want to go up to the fair?\" Herman Andersen had asked,\r\nwhen they reached the corner.\r\n\r\n\"Why,--\" Hanny hesitated,--\"we have seen it a good many times,\" and she\r\ngave her soft, rippling laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go over to Tompkin's Square.\" He had something to say to her\r\nthat would be easier said in those deserted walks. You could always find\r\nthem except on Saturday or Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" with her graceful assent.\r\n\r\nThe birds, done with their summer housekeeping and child-rearing, had\r\ntime to sing again. But it was all low, plaintive songs, as if they\r\nsaid: \"We must go away from the place in which we have been so happy.\r\nWill we be sure to come another spring?\" Now and then a branch stirred.\r\nThe grass had been cut for the last time, and there were sweet little\r\nwinrows that filled the air with fragrance. He was quiet, for he liked\r\nto hear her enchanting talk. It had turned upon when she was a little\r\ngirl, and how queer things were! It didn't seem as if everything could\r\nchange so. And what a great gay time they had at the Beekmans' when\r\nStephen was married! So they walked around, and were at an entrance. A\r\ncabman put down a woman and some children just as Mr. Andersen had said,\r\n\"We were going up there some day, you know; we ought to go before\r\neverything has faded.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she made answer.\r\n\r\n\"See here, we might get this cab and go up now\"--looking up with eager\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\nDickens had not created Mr. Wemmick with his delightful off-hand\r\npremeditated happenings; but other people had them even then.\r\n\r\nShe made no demur, but assented with her innocent eyes full of exquisite\r\nsweetness.\r\n\r\nHe helped her in and sat along side of her. He had all kinds of young\r\nlover-like thoughts, and really he so seldom had her alone. He wanted to\r\nsnatch up the hand and kiss it. It made such a tempting background for\r\nthe lace mitt. No one but old ladies wore gloves, except on very fine\r\noccasions. And her slim little fingers, with their pink nails, were so\r\npretty! If he could even hold her hand!\r\n\r\nBut they jolted over rough streets, through little clumps of Irish\r\nvillages, and laughed over the pigs, and geese, and children. Then\r\nwastes again, with long, straight lines where streets were to be.\r\n\r\n\"That is the house over there,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if you could walk back? Or shall I keep the cab?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no. It is so delightful to walk!\"\r\n\r\nAh, how the hand of improvement had disfigured everything! leaving ugly,\r\nsquare, naked blocks, with here and there a house, then a space where\r\nthe trees were still standing; but the children despoiled the lilacs and\r\ndogwood in the spring, and thrashed the lindens and black walnuts all\r\nthe later summer, until the poor things had a weary, drooping aspect.\r\nOver here was the great garden, and a street ran through it. The old\r\nhouse was shabby, and needed painting; and most of the vines had been\r\ncut away. The steps were broken. Several families inhabited it now. The\r\ncousin had thrown it up in disgust.\r\n\r\nBut the young man saw it through her eyes, glorified with the glamour of\r\nchildhood. Slim young Dolly, Aunt Gitty netting, the ladies in\r\nrocking-chairs with their sewing under the trees, Mr. Beckman and\r\nKatschina, and the tea on little tables; and the boys she was afraid of.\r\n\r\n\"They were such pudgy little boys,\" she says, with a laugh in which\r\nthere is only a remembered mirth. \"They were like some of Irving's\r\ndescriptions. You wouldn't expect them to grow up into such fine-looking\r\nmen, now, would you? I think Peter is almost handsome.\"\r\n\r\nIt gives him a little twinge. He was jealous of Peter awhile ago; but he\r\nadmits bravely that Peter is very good-looking.\r\n\r\nAnd here are some poor willows. Oh, the lovely shrubbery that is\r\nneglected and dying!\r\n\r\n\"After all, it _is_ the people who give the charm to places,--the loving\r\ncare, the home delight. But no one could keep it up. Property gets too\r\nvaluable, and taxation is too high; and there are so many poorer people\r\nwho must have homes.\"\r\n\r\nThese sententious bits of wisdom he considers utterly charming. She has\r\ncaught them from John.\r\n\r\nThen they sit down on a great stone and rest, though she protests she is\r\nnot tired. She can walk for hours.\r\n\r\nNow he ought to tell her all that is in his heart. If the world stands\r\nthousands of years there will never be such a golden opportunity again.\r\nShe breaks off a bit of yarrow and sticks it in her belt. How\r\nbeautifully the lashes droop over her eyes, deepening and softening the\r\ntint, until it looks like a glint of heaven!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we ought to go on,\" she says presently; and with a dainty smile and\r\nmotion, she rises. Ah, if she knew what he is wild to utter!\r\n\r\nThey turn their steps homeward. A wood-robin in a thicket sings,\r\n\"Sweet, sweet, I love you, I l-o-v-e you,\" with a maddening, lingering\r\ncadence.\r\n\r\nWhy is he not as brave as the bird? Are there any choicer, more\r\nexquisite words in which to say it?\r\n\r\nThey come to a little stream. \"Oh, just down here is Kissing Bridge,\"\r\nshe says, with a kind of girlish gleefulness.\r\n\r\nShe had made her father tell the old Dutch story one evening, when they\r\nwere all sitting on the stoop. And as they go on, she, with a sort of\r\neager, heedless step, as if she was not walking on his heart, tells\r\nabout Stephen, and how he jumped out of the carriage and gathered a\r\ngreat bunch of roses for her. They have reached the spot. The stream has\r\nshrunken. You could step over it.\r\n\r\n\"They were just there.\" She indicates the spot with a pretty gesture of\r\nher head. \"But there are no wild-roses now;\" and a soft sigh escapes\r\nher, as she turns to him, and their eyes meet.\r\n\r\n\"Are there none?\" he asks, his eyes drinking in the sudden radiance. For\r\nif ever dainty, delicate, ethereal wild-roses bloomed, they are in her\r\ncheeks; and oh, what are her scarlet lips that have meant to answer, and\r\nare mysteriously tranfixed with the rarest sweetness!\r\n\r\nHe kisses her--once, a dozen times. There is no one near. They own the\r\ncity,--the whole world, for love is Lord of all.\r\n\r\nHe slips her hand in his arm. Its tremble thrills every nerve in his\r\nbody. He experiences the overwhelming joy of possessorship, for she _is_\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n\"My darling little Nan;\" and his voice is unsteady with emotion.\r\n\r\nHe has rechristened Baby Stevie's pet name; but it has never sounded so\r\nenchanting before.\r\n\r\nThen they walk on in delicious silence. Another bird sings in a drowsy\r\nafternoon tone,--\r\n\r\n\"Sweet, sweet, I love you, I l-o-v-e you.\"\r\n\r\nThey glance at each other, and both translate it. Her cheeks are redder\r\nthan wild-roses now; and her dimple holds the sweetness of a great\r\nmystery. They both smile, and he kisses her again. Why not? There is no\r\none about.\r\n\r\n\"My darling, can you guess when I first began to love you?\" He wants her\r\nto know all the story. It seems as if his whole life will not be long\r\nenough to get it told and he must begin at once.\r\n\r\n\"When?\" There is a startled sound in her voice, as if she was amazed\r\nthat love had a beginning.\r\n\r\n\"That night in the dance,--the Spanish dance. We will go somewhere this\r\nwinter and dance it over again; and the music beats will say--'I love\r\nyou.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, so long ago?\" she exclaims.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and I have a visiting-card of yours.\" He hunts in his card-case.\r\n\"Here it is--'Miss Nan Underhill.' I've kissed it thousands of times. I\r\nhave almost worn it out. And when I went home I told my father about the\r\nlittle girl in New York that I must come back and win.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, did you!\" She is touched by the revelation.\r\n\r\n\"He is a delightful father. Some time I must take you over to see him,\r\nor he may come here. But he had promised that I should go to Ebberfeld;\r\nand so I did. The aunt had proposed the match.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your poor cousin!\" Her voice is full of such infinite pity that he\r\ngives the little hand a tender pressure for thanks.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't have loved her anyhow. She seems older than I; and I am a\r\nvery boy in heart. Then she was too large. I like little women.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am so glad,\" she cries, with unaffected joy, \"for I am small; and I\r\nnever can grow any larger. But I don't mind now.\"\r\n\r\n\"So when my father found how much in earnest I was, he planned the\r\nbusiness change. It was my own mother's money, you know. But he has been\r\na good father to me, and I am glad he has some other children. I was to\r\ngo to Paris.\"\r\n\r\nThat seems so magnificent she is almost conscience smitten.\r\n\r\nAh, how much there is to say!\r\n\r\n\"But you will get tired with all this long walk,\" he exclaims anxiously.\r\nOh, blessed thought! he will have the right to keep her rested and\r\nhappy, and in a realm of joy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she returns. \"Why, the walk has not seemed long.\" The surprise\r\nin her voice is enchanting.\r\n\r\nIs any walk ever too long for love? Is any day too long,--even all of\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nThe crickets and peeps come out; a locust drones his slow tune. The sun\r\nhas dropped down. Well, they are in an enchanted country that needs no\r\nsun but that of love. And if they walked all night they could not say\r\nall that has been brought to light by the mighty touch that wakes human\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nAt home grandmother's difficult breathing has returned, and they have\r\nhad a troubled hour. But now she is all right, except that she will be\r\nweaker to-morrow. Mrs. Underhill goes downstairs and bustles about the\r\nsupper as a relief from the strain. She makes a slice of\r\ndelicately-browned toast. Joe comes rushing in.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, but the servant at the Dentons has cut her hand badly. Don't\r\nwait supper for me,\" he exclaims.\r\n\r\n\"Jim has not come in, and no one can tell when those children will be\r\nback. If the fair should keep open three months longer every one will be\r\ndead with fatigue. Yes, we'll wait. I am going to take some toast up to\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\n\"The children!\" Doctor Joe has a strange, guilty sort of feeling. What\r\nif to-night should bring her a new son, as some future night will bring\r\nher a new daughter?\r\n\r\nFather Underhill sits on the front stoop reading his paper. He glances\r\nup now and then. When he espies a small figure in soft gray with a\r\nwide-brimmed leghorn hat, and a young man, he studies them more\r\nattentively. What is this? She has the young man's arm,--that has gone\r\nout of date for engaged people,--and her head inclines toward him. She\r\nglances up and smiles.\r\n\r\nAnd then a great pang rends the father's soul. They come nearer, and she\r\nsmiles to him; but, oh! there is a light in her face, a gladness shining\r\nin her eyes, a tremulous sweetness about the mouth. Did he read all this\r\nin her mother's face years and years ago? Did _her_ mother have this\r\nawful pang that seems to wrench body and soul asunder?\r\n\r\nThey say good-evening and that it has been a glorious afternoon. The\r\nyoung man will lose no time,--hasn't he been dangling three months\r\nalready?\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Underhill, may I see you a moment?\"\r\n\r\nHow brave and sweet and assured the voice is! And he helps the little\r\ngirl up the steps, through the hall space, and the three stand in the\r\nparlour, where the young man prefers his request with such a daring that\r\nthe elder man is almost dazed. Then the father holds out his arms as if\r\nhe was grasping for something lost. She comes to them, and her head is\r\non his breast, her hands reaching up to clasp him about the neck.\r\n\r\n\"And this little girl, too!\"\r\n\r\nHis voice is broken, his face goes down to hers. The sweetest thing of\r\nhis life,--how can he give her up?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father, father!\" The cry is so entreating, so piteous, and he feels\r\nthe tears on her sweet face. \"Oh, father, can I not love you both?\"\r\n\r\nShe loosens one hand and holds it out to the young man. He feels the\r\nmotion, and accepts the fact that her heart is divided. She draws her\r\nlover in the circle. \"You will love him for my sake.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! alas! she is his little girl no longer. She is another man's\r\nsweetheart, and will one day be his wife. It is the fashion in this\r\nworld; it has God's favor and sanction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n1897\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that was long ago. It is nearing the end of the century, and the\r\nlittle girl who thought it a great thing to see the half-century mark,\r\nbids fair to shake hands with the new one. There have been many changes,\r\nthere have been sorrows and deaths, and such exquisite satisfying\r\nhappiness that she could say with the poet,--\r\n\r\n        \"Let come what come may\r\n    I shall have had my day.\"\r\n\r\nShe is in the older generation now, and a grandmother. You may see her\r\nin Central Park, or some of the surburban places, a fair, sweet small\r\npersonage, with a face more nearly beautiful than in her girlhood. Her\r\nhair has that shining silvery tint, her complexion is clear and fine,\r\nand her eyes, though they have wept bitter tears, still look out gladly,\r\nserenely, on life.\r\n\r\nIn the carriage will be her twin granddaughters, and sometimes a young\r\nman, her son. They are pretty children, and will be \"summer girls\" when\r\ntheir time comes, and \"winter girls\" as well, clad in cloth and velvet\r\nand furs. They will dance Germans instead of the bewildering Spanish\r\ndance she had that first night with her lover. Even children have\r\nchanged in half a century. Beauty is no longer considered a delusion and\r\na snare. Physical culture gives strength and grace and growth.\r\n\r\nThe lover of her youth and the husband of her love, and her first-born\r\ndaughter, who was wedded, and who with her husband faced a railroad\r\ntragedy and were its victims, have gone into that \"goodly land and\r\nlarge.\" It seems to many of us as we grow older that there is only a\r\nthin wall between this and the other country where we shall see them\r\nagain. Sometimes she can almost fancy them leaning over the jasper\r\nwalls, like the Blessed Damosel, and smiling down on her. There are so\r\nmany of them now! And the children were given to her. They are spoiled,\r\nall the aunts and cousins declare. But grandmamma lives another youth\r\nover in them,--a delightful life, rich in love and interest.\r\n\r\nFor conditions have changed. The world, and all that therein is, has\r\nchanged. It is Greater New York now, and it stretches out everywhere.\r\nWhat was Brooklyn, and Williamsburg, and many a pretty town up above the\r\ncity, have all been merged into one grand metropolis. What it will do in\r\nthe next fifty years passes conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs they drive around nothing interests them more than to have grandmamma\r\ntalk of what it was like when she was a little girl. They find the\r\nplaces, and look at them through her eyes. There is no longer any\r\nBowling-Green, only in name, and though part of the Battery is left, the\r\nelevated roads go winding about among the tree-tops; Castle Garden,\r\nafter many vicissitudes and debasements, is again a place of interest\r\nand entertainment. Here was where she heard that sweet and wonderful\r\nJenny Lind, who, with Parepa Rosa, and many another divine voice, is\r\nsinging up in the New Jerusalem. And though hundreds in the glare of\r\nlight and blaze of diamonds listen to Patti, she wonders if the\r\nenthusiasm is as deep and sincere.\r\n\r\nOver opposite where modest Brooklyn lived its simple, friendly life\r\nfifty years ago, stretching out into country ways and green fields,\r\nthere are miles of houses, and the great bridge is such an everyday\r\naffair one hardly gives it a second thought. And all is business now,\r\nwith tall buildings that the glance can hardly reach. There is no City\r\nHall Park, but a great space of flagging, though the fountain remains.\r\nBusiness crowds hurry to and fro where ladies used to sit and chat while\r\nthe young people strolled about.\r\n\r\nStewart's old marble building is common-place and dingy. Delmonico has\r\ngone on up-town stride by stride, and people have forgotten the old\r\nbalcony where Jenny Lind sang, and Koenig played to a street packed with\r\npeople. And the Prince de Joinville was here; also Louis Napoleon, the\r\nnephew of his uncle, who followed his steps as Emperor and loser of\r\ncrown and all, and exile. And the young Prince Imperial, whose birth, so\r\nlong desired and celebrated with state as was that of the young King of\r\nRome, met with as melancholy a fate and early death as the Duc de\r\nReichstadt. And here the young Prince of Wales dined. He came down\r\nBroadway with his suite and procession, and the little wife thought it a\r\nfine sight as she stood there to see.\r\n\r\nBroadway stretches on and on. Union Square is really a thoroughfare; but\r\nshe came up here with father and the boys when it was a grand new thing.\r\n\r\nDid she really live in First Street with Aunt Daisy for a playmate, and\r\nAuntie Reed, and Nora, who was a much admired singer in her day, and who\r\nmarried a Roman Count; and the little Tudie who died? Did she have that\r\nsplendid Christmas and the beautiful wax doll, that seems sacredly alive\r\nto them both; only under some spell of enchantment laid upon her by\r\nMerlin's clan?\r\n\r\nOh, how full the streets are now with their great high tenement-houses,\r\npouring out their myriads of children all day long, of every\r\nnationality! But you still hear the old plays, \"Open the Gates,\" and\r\n\"Scotland's Burning,\" and \"Uncle John is very Sick,\" and \"Ring around a\r\nRosy.\" Little Sally Waters still sits in the sun,--\r\n\r\n    \"Crying and sighing for a young man,\"\r\n\r\nthough modern poesy advises her to--\r\n\r\n            \"Rise, Sally, rise,\r\n    Wipe your eyes out with your frock.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the strange Chinatown, with its cabalistic signs, its men in blue\r\nshirts and pigtails, and often snowy white stockings and queer pointed\r\nslippers!\r\n\r\nThey wind slowly about Central Park. Was the Crystal Palace here? And no\r\npark? To them it seems as if New York must have been born this way, with\r\nelectric lights, and push-buttons, and telephones, and cars, and\r\ntelegraphs, and everything. And did grandmamma come up here to the Fair;\r\nand was it anything like the Museum of Art? And wasn't there any\r\nmenagerie, or playground, or donkey-riding or bicyclers?\r\n\r\nHere is Washington Arch, with its memory of a great anniversary. Over on\r\nthe west side there is a curious spot fenced in with wooden palings,\r\nwhere Alexander Hamilton planted thirteen trees for the Union, when\r\nthere were only thirteen States, and named them all. Even before his sad\r\ndeath, South Carolina was braced to keep her from growing crooked; but\r\nshe went awry in spite of it all. They have moved the house in which he\r\nlived, across the street, to save it from destruction; and it is in the\r\nshadow of a church. And here is the old mansion where Aaron Burr lived a\r\nbrief while with Madame Jumel for his wedded wife,--a beautiful old\r\nplace on a hill.\r\n\r\nThey go on up to the grand Washington Bridge. They are very fond of the\r\nstory of Anthony Woolf swimming across the Harlem that dark night to get\r\naway from the Hessian regiment, and begging shelter of kindly hearts.\r\nThey turn into a shaded road, and pass by lovely grounds, where wealth\r\nhas made gardens and terraces akin to those of Paradise. And winding\r\ndown the old road leading to the vale, they find a little dark-eyed girl\r\nwhose great-great-grandfather was this same Anthony Woolf. And the\r\nRevolutionary War was a century and a quarter ago! Here they have lived\r\nfor generations. The Cousin Jennie has gone, but the tall bright-eyed\r\nman who married her is still hale and hearty, with snowy hair and beard.\r\n\r\nYes, it is all New York up to Kingsbridge. There are many historic\r\nspots, and several old manor houses still standing. But it has a city\r\naspect in spite of some wildness. They go around to Fordham; the old\r\nhouse perched on the hill is there, though it has been enlarged, and the\r\nstreet widened and straightened. Up on the old porch grandmamma sat and\r\nread; and it still hangs out with a tempting aspect, just as when she\r\nwatched the pedestrians and the reverend fathers, who yet go up and\r\ndown. And here is the little old Poe Cottage, about which such a flavor\r\nof romance lingers, though the place has been modernised into a\r\n\"Terrace,\" and built about with city pretentiousness. It is still the\r\nsame little low place, not a bit changed since she sat there on the\r\ndoor-sill and talked over her heroes with the poet. She can still see\r\nthe tall spare figure of Mrs. Clemm in her rocking-chair doing her bit\r\nof mending and casting anxious glances at the son of her love, about\r\nwhom so much has been written in later days. People still quote the\r\n\"Raven\" and \"Ullalume,\" but all she cares to remember is \"Annabel Lee,\"\r\nand the weird stories are not to her taste.\r\n\r\nThe old Odell house at West Farms was swept away long ago; Janey is a\r\ngrandmother on a big farm that is crowded with summer boarders. Polly\r\nis in Oregon, her sons coming up with the country. And up a short\r\ndistance, Jerome Park used to be thronged by the beauty and fashion of\r\nthe city on racing days. And that has gone, too.\r\n\r\nA little to the eastward is the beautiful Bronx Park, that is going to\r\ntread closely on its down-town rival. Oh, is Central Park really\r\ndown-town? There are woods and wilds, ravines and the leisurely stream,\r\ntrees that have been brought from everywhere, walks and drives, hills\r\nclothed with verdure, and the old Lorillard mansion still grand, with\r\nits legend of love and tragedy. Its gardens have changed indeed.\r\nGrandmamma remembers the small old man, who used to gather his rose\r\nleaves day by day from the fragrant beds,--Lorillard's rose-snuff was a\r\ngreat thing two generations ago.\r\n\r\n\"Did they really take snuff?\" asks Ethel, in disgust. \"How queer!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you know,\" says Rose, \"that Uncle Herman told us of a man who\r\ndeclined to take snuff, because if nature had intended his nose for a\r\ndust-pan, she would have put it the other side up.\"\r\n\r\nHow they both laugh at that!\r\n\r\nThey have a governess friend at home, but they are continually picking\r\nup knowledge in their rides and rambles about. They know the old city\r\nthat was afraid to stray above Union Square, they know the modern city\r\nwith its fifty years of improvements, and they will grow up to womanhood\r\nin Greater New York, the Star City of the Continent.\r\n\r\nHere in one of the pleasant streets overlooking the park, they live.\r\nThey are not rich; no one is now who doesn't go up in the millions.\r\nThere is a pretty house looking like a hotel, an apartment house,--very\r\nmoderate since it only accommodates three families. Joseph, the eldest\r\nson, who should have been a doctor, but is a fine architect, is married,\r\nand with his wife and two babies, and a dear friend who is an artist,\r\nhas one side, and the other is grandmamma's. It is quite like a house by\r\nthemselves, only there is a beautiful square hall, and a handsome\r\nstairway one could hardly have space for in a small house. Herman, the\r\nsecond son, lives with them, and is a scientist, and wields the pen of a\r\nready writer. He has no taste for the toil and moil of money-getting,--a\r\nrefined, studious, thoughtful young man.\r\n\r\nThey have all had their share of happiness. Dolly and Stephen are really\r\nold people, and have a flock of grandchildren. Hanny can see her own\r\nfather again in Stephen, and Dolly, since she has grown stout and\r\nwhite-haired, suggests her mother. Stephen's sons are promising young\r\nbusiness-men. There is only one little grave marking their prosperous\r\npathway,--a baby girl, who went so soon they have hardly missed her.\r\n\r\nMargaret is still handsome and aristocratic. Dr. Hoffman long ago gave\r\nup practice, his property interests increased so rapidly. Their sons and\r\ndaughters are of the higher society order, intellectual, fine and noble,\r\nand a power in the land. One daughter has married an Englishman of\r\nrank, the other is the wife of a Bishop. Margaret is serene and\r\nsatisfied, and still very fond of her little sister.\r\n\r\nDear Doctor Joe lectures mostly, and attends to hospital surgery, still\r\nkeeping his tender sympathy for suffering humanity. After Grandmother\r\nVan Kortlandt went away, he brought Daisy Jasper home, to help fill the\r\nvacant spaces. And presently, when Mrs. Jasper was left alone, she came,\r\ntoo, the house being so large. Two mothers-in-law, according to the\r\nrules of family lore, ought to have quarrelled and sulked, but they\r\ndidn't. And the babies that came were a source of delight. Though there\r\nwas suffering in Daisy's life, there was so much joy that, to her, it\r\nwas the unalloyed delight of living.\r\n\r\nAnd Jim outgrew his fancy, and had many another one that did not strike\r\ndeep enough in the soil to lead him to ask a woman to marry him. But he\r\nand Daisy were fast friends, and he saw that no one could ever have\r\ncared for her as well and wisely as dear Doctor Joe, with his wonderful\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nJim, brilliant and gay and witty, was a fine, fluent speaker, studying\r\nsuch eloquent models as Webster and Choate, and the vanished Clay. Did\r\nHanny remember, when they had lost his election, and he, Jim, had turned\r\nout with the Democratic boys? There are grave questions now, on wider\r\nthan party lines, and sometimes the hearts of thoughtful statesmen beat\r\nwith an undefined fear.\r\n\r\nThe fun-loving, dancing side of his nature often asserts itself. Women\r\nadore him. Though he is not rich, the mothers smile on him for the\r\n\"promise yet to be.\" Even Lily Williamson tries her arts; admiration is\r\nwhat she lives for now. She is one of the handsome, fascinating society\r\nvampires, who make great capital out of matrimonial infelicities, to\r\nappeal to the sympathies of really good and generous men, who are the\r\nmore easily caught in the silken nets. One day she leaves her worthless\r\ndrunken husband, when his money is all spent, and elopes with a young\r\nfellow of excellent family who has just come into a fortune, and later\r\nbecomes one of the adventuresses that disgrace Americans in the eyes of\r\nEuropean propriety.\r\n\r\nBen and Delia go abroad,--Ben in the interest of his paper, which is\r\nnext to his wife; Delia to write travel letters for a weekly, and find\r\nmaterial for her novel. It is quite a picnic, and they enjoy the\r\neconomies.\r\n\r\nThen the clouds that have been gathering a long, long while, break over\r\nthe country, and all is tumult from end to end. The Seventh Regiment\r\n\"boys\" go down to Washington, with brave, laughing, high-hearted Jim,\r\nwho understands that it is no child's play, but a bitter struggle that\r\nwill call forth the best energies of the country, and who enlists for\r\n\"three years or the whole war.\" Ben hurries home, and takes his place in\r\nthe ranks. When things are at their lowest ebb, and men's hearts are\r\nsinking with fear, quiet, grave John buckles on a soldier's haversack\r\nand marches away. The others have substitutes.\r\n\r\nAh, what times they were! It is well that flowers can spring up on a\r\nbattlefield. The little girl keeps track of her heroes. Kearny, who has\r\nseen Magenta and Solferino, meets his fate at Chantilly. Many another\r\none who has come up to fame, many new ones, who are on the march to win\r\nor die.\r\n\r\nJohn is wounded, patched up in a hospital, and honorably discharged,\r\nlamed for life. But he has done good work. Ben has a slight mishap, and\r\nDelia sends her two babies and their nurse to her sister's, and goes to\r\nthe hospital, and remains. Women of brains and kindly impulses are much\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nAnd one night some wounded are brought in. There has been a fateful\r\nreconnoisance, but it has saved the regiment from destruction on the\r\nnext day. This limp figure in a captain's uniform is laid tenderly on a\r\ncot; but the surgeon, after a brief examination, shakes his head. Oh,\r\nsurely, she knows that handsome face with the clustering dark curls!\r\n\r\nHe opens his eyes, and after an instant says in a faint voice, \"Oh,\r\nDele, is that you?\" then lapses into insensibility. There is nothing to\r\nbe done; that is the cruelest of all. Once again, after a long while, he\r\nmoves his head, and opens his eyes again, brave and clear even in death.\r\n\r\n\"Delia,\" in a strange, strong voice that surprises her, \"kiss them all\r\ngood-night for me;\" and James Odell Underhill has gone to the land of\r\neverlasting morning.\r\n\r\nThe war ends; and Ben comes home none the worse. He has reached his\r\nambition, and is a \"newspaper man\" in every sense of the word. Delia\r\nsets up housekeeping, takes home the babies, and in the course of time\r\nadds two more to them.\r\n\r\nBut there is another ferment, and women are coming to the fore. There\r\nare clubs and suffrage meetings, lectures; women have even invaded\r\nchurches, and preach; and colleges for higher education are springing up\r\neverywhere. There are poets and philosophers, there are teachers and\r\norators; some of them ill-judged, because they are fond of notoriety;\r\nbut there are always some wry sheep in the best of flocks. Have men\r\nalways been honest and wise and honourable and grand?\r\n\r\nDelia lectures and writes, and is one of the able women of the day. Mrs.\r\nHoffman on her serene heights _is_ mortified. Mother Underhill is sure\r\nBen has to go to a restaurant, that his stockings are never mended, his\r\nbuttons always off. But patent buttons are invented, and collar-buttons\r\nthat cannot be ironed off by the \"washerwoman,\" supply a long-felt want.\r\nBen is stout and comfortable-looking, and the same grave, affectionate\r\nfellow. The children seem to come up without much sickness or trouble.\r\nWhen Mother Underhill feels disposed to cavil and criticise, for she\r\n_is_ shocked by the new woman's heresies, she recalls the \"last\r\ngood-night kiss,\" and is silent. What if there had been no one at hand\r\nto bring it home?\r\n\r\nDelia's girls grow up into \"modern women.\" It is true they do not spend\r\nhalf a day a week darning stockings, neither have they learned to put\r\nthe exquisite over and under darns in tablecloths that the little girl\r\ncould do by the time she was ten. But they sing and play; they are ready\r\nspeech-makers, and clubs are glad to get them. They know about Greek\r\nantiquities and Central American wonders; they can take up the questions\r\nof the day intelligently; one paints really very well, and has entered\r\npictures at the Academy. One is interested in industrial schools for\r\ngirls, and the doctor, who is \"Daisy Jasper,\" a tall, bright,\r\ngood-looking woman, has a big, tender heart for all babies who are\r\nsuffering, and trains many a poor mother how to care judiciously for her\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nBut all the nieces think Aunt Nan just the loveliest and sweetest body\r\nin the world. They send her flowers and bric-à-brac; they beg her to\r\ncome here and there to receptions and charity bazaars, and reunions of\r\nall sorts. She is so small and dainty, and they are all growing up to\r\nthe new stature.\r\n\r\nGeorge has come home at last, after varying fortunes. He has seen San\r\nFrancisco built and destroyed by fire, and rebuilt, and at last planned\r\ninto a handsome city. He has mined and been in the wild life known only\r\nto the few remaining \"forty-niners.\" He has gained and lost, been burned\r\nout and robbed, been one of the heads of a Vigilance Committee, and\r\nmayor of a town; and at last, when all is serene and prosperous, a great\r\nwave of homesickness overtakes him.\r\n\r\nIt is twenty years since he went away, though he has been home once in\r\nthe time. He is spare, and has a weather-beaten look, and is old for his\r\nyears. Is the money worth all the sacrifice?\r\n\r\nHe will build a house on their part of the old farm at Yonkers, where\r\nhis heart has turned in many a weary hour; but Uncle Faid and Aunt Crete\r\nare dead. Barton Finch and Retty are living in town, and Barton is a\r\nthriving manufacturer. Yonkers has stretched out; and the suburbs are in\r\nthat ugly transition state of new unworked streets and dingy cottages,\r\nfor property has been cut up and lots sold cheaply. Father Underhill is\r\noffered a great price for his, and sells it. It is no longer George's\r\nideal home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eustis begs him to come up to Tarrytown. All the other Morgans are\r\ngone, and she is left alone. The place shall belong to George if he will\r\ngive her a home her few remaining years.\r\n\r\nHe will not listen to this, but buys it, and builds on a new part. Then\r\nhe marries a nice girl whose youth is past, and who is delighted with\r\nher kindly, indulgent husband. They have no children; but the nieces and\r\nnephews flock hither for rest and recreation, and are always fascinated\r\nwith Uncle George's adventures.\r\n\r\nDelia is at middle life when she writes her book, but then it is no\r\nyoung girl's story with an imperious Rochester-like hero, that we used\r\nto shiver over and adore. It is a serious, inspiriting woman's book, and\r\ncarries weight in spite of the flood of new literature.\r\n\r\nCharles Reed has followed a manly, pure, and high-minded Christian\r\ncourse, and left an impress on the hurrying world. Josie has grown\r\nbroader and more intelligent, and made a delightful household mother.\r\nThere have been children enough to satisfy Grandmamma Reed.\r\n\r\nThese old friends meet now and then, and talk as people will when they\r\nbegin to go down the decline on the other side of the hill that they\r\nclimbed with such a light step and high heart. How simple life was then\r\ncompared with the ramifications of to-day!\r\n\r\nThe old songs, the old poets, the old novelists are gone. \"Jane Eyre\" no\r\nlonger holds us spell-bound, though the three sisters in the bleak old\r\nHaworth Rectory will never be forgotten; nor that strange \"Rosemary,\"\r\nand Huntingdon's \"Lady Alice,\" thought to be so unsettling to the faith.\r\nWe read \"Robert Elsmere,\" and \"John Ward, Preacher,\" and go our way\r\ntranquilly. Education has become almost a synonym for genius.\r\n\r\nThe gold of the Pacific Coast, the oil wells, the rich spoils of the\r\nearth, have been touched with the wand of industry and science.\r\nRailroads run to and fro; vessels dot the ocean; we cross it now in less\r\nthan a week. Cables bring us hour-old news from everywhere. We go abroad\r\nfor seasons and touch elbows with royalty, and are not abashed. We\r\ngather the beauty and wisdom of the old world. We build palaces, and\r\nspend on an evening's entertainment what would have been a fortune fifty\r\nyears ago. We have private palace-cars, and luxurious yachts for\r\npleasure, and others for speed, so swift that the \"America's Cup\" has\r\nremained in our keeping all these years.\r\n\r\nWill we presently utter the old cry of the wise man who \"gat him\r\neverything,\" \"that all is vanity\"?\r\n\r\nWhen the children are asleep the little grandmother goes down to her\r\nson's study. He is not ambitious for show or wealth, but he has a rather\r\nluxurious side. The rugs are soft; the chairs are easy, the library is\r\nfilled with choice books. Sometimes she sits and reads, and brave old\r\nThackeray is one of her favourites. It is as her lover said,--it takes\r\nyears and experience to see all the tender, hidden mysteries of his best\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThen she puts aside her book, and he his work, and they talk. \"What your\r\nfather said\" and \"your father thought this way,\" always has a charm for\r\nhim, and he misses his father more than any one can imagine. He knows\r\nabout the trip to Germany, and the visit to grandfather, with Paris at\r\nits highest estate and the beautiful Empress Eugénie. And London with\r\nits Queen, who has reigned sixty years, and who, like his mother, has\r\nmade part of the pilgrimage with a great sorrow buried in her heart.\r\nSome day he is going over it all; but he will not see the handsome,\r\ngolden-haired empress, who is but a pale, sorrowful ghost, and perhaps\r\nnot the Queen. He would go to-morrow, if he could take the little\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThey talk, too, of the future. There have been fifty magical years when\r\nyou look back,--years of discovery, of perfection in art and invention,\r\nof nations making rapid strides, of Africa illumined by explorers, of\r\nJapan coming to the front when hardly fifty years have elapsed since she\r\nfirst opened her gates to strangers.\r\n\r\nAnd of the great City that has gathered the little towns of children who\r\nwent out from her again in her arms,--will she be beautiful and grand\r\nand wise, and a power among men and cities? She has gathered heroes,\r\nliving and dead, in her bosom, and for the greatest of all reared a\r\nmarble temple. Oh, what will she be in fifty more years?\r\n\r\n\"You may live to see it,\" the little mother says, and smiles.\r\n\r\nFor herself there is the other country, and the loves she holds most\r\ndear. And because they go, when the worst sorrow is spent, one knows\r\nthey will be found again, and that immortality is no myth, but the crown\r\nand seal of God's love to human love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe \"Little Girl\" Series\r\n\r\nBy AMANDA M.
